TiiK tonditiotis of living are fast dianging, the 
number of gentle jx^ople living in small houses and 
Hats run with One Maid, or with no maid at all is 
rapidly increasing. Tlie Otic Maid Book of Cookery 
is specially written with a view to these modern 
conditions. It is a book of Cookery (not a book of 
recipes) and as such must be read if to be of any real 
use. It is strongly urged that the chief methods of 
cookery together with their principles be mastered 
before practical work is started. Before using a 
recipe the notes at the commencement of the partic- 
ular chapter should l)e carefully studied. Obviously 
it is impossible to repeat minute instructions with 
each recipe. The Index should be referred to in 
any difticulty. It is hoped that the One Maid /Joo/v- 
('/ Cooki y (aptly named by its publisher) may help 
in the attainment of that 'peace of mind and har- 
mony within' to which all aspire.

THE ART OF COOKERY 

C00KP:RY is the art of preparing food for 
use by the aid of heat, or rendering it palat- 
able and easy to digest, the aim being to 
get the maximum of nutriment and flavour out 
of the material available. With this end in 
view, methods of cookery have been evolved which 
require to be known and understood, together with 
the principles ou which they are based, otherwise 
much of the nourishment and value of food is 
wasted, and it may become a fruitful source of 
digestive trouble. 

An Eastern writer lately called attention to the 
fact that natives of so many countries cook excel- 
lently without having had any training. Ask them 
how they cook, and they will answer with their 
own proverb 'On each occasion use your sense 
accordingly.' In this country there are some born 
cooks, but they are few and far between. It is 
probable that the overloading of the brain with 
book-learning knocks out much of what we call 
common sense. We liave vSch(x>ls of Cookery and 



THE ONE MAID BOOK OF COOKERY 

Books of Cookery to hdp the large number of 
mistresses and maids who find themselves in the 
position of having to run a house in complete 
Ignorance of the principles of Domestic Economy 
Only practice and experience will make a cook 
though hooks and lessons will help. Much can be 
learnt by studying physiology (particularly the 
processes ot digestion and assimi]ation\ the chem- 
istry of Food and I'ood \'alues. and by learning the 
several methods and prmciples of cookery With 
some knowledge and common sense practical work 
soon becomes easy. 

In cookery, method is important and there is a 
reason why for everything. Recipes are of little 
value without a knowledge of how to work them 
what ingredients can be omitted without spoiling 
the result, and what substitutes can be used Cook- 
ery IS not an exact science, many recipes cannot 
be accurately written. For instance, 'take two 
onions : an onion may weigh a pound or an ounce 
U hat size ol onion is to be used ? The answer is 
on each occasion use your .sense accordingly ' 

The importance of the subject of Food and its 
preparation is beyond question: standing as it 
does for health, efficiency and happiness, or the 
reverse. 'Miow me what you eat, and I will tell 
you what you are.' \\'hcre every home contains a 
kitchen. It IS unpardonable that girls of all classes 
should not be able to cook, and incredible that 
anyone should put up with bad or badly prepared 
food. The neglect of the Domestic Art:^ can only 
be accounted for by the fact that, generally speak-

THE ART OF COOKERY 

ing, their importance and interest are not recog- 
nised. Here I will plead fcr the fair treatment of 
good food. Meals should be given a certain dignity 
and due time allowed for their enjoyment. The 
cook should not be blamed for troubles that arise 
from insufiicient and hurried mastication, or for 
dishes spoilt through unpunctuality. It is well to 
remember, moreover, that adverse criticism always 
reaches the kitchen. Cooks are human, and enjoy 
praise and appreciation when deserved as much as 
anyone else. Food is fuel for the body, providing 
material for building, repairing, and warming. To 
eat is a necessity and a duty, it should also be a 
pleasure. Without being a 'gourmand' it is well lo 
be a 'gourmet,' to possess both knowledge and 
palate to enjoy and encourage the production of 
good food. 

vShopping, housekeeping, and cooking, are games 
that are beloved in childhood. Later on the game 
becomes a serious occupation, enjoyable or not 
according to the skill with which it is played

h:s country. When shops are easv of acce s 

all perishable stufiF should be bought in smal 

ciuan mes, so that there n:ay be fres^ food daTly 

and feu- or no scraps to use up. Each day's food 

s^iould be coniplete and harmonious in itsdf. If 

lunch has been poor, dinner must make up for it • 

If meat be scanty, a good soup, savoury dish t' 

^should be .served at the same meal; iLninter- 

es ng, a choice vegetable should accompany it If

THE ART OF CATERING 

ately eat half a dozen eggs in a daj-, but in the form 
of custards, souffles, omelettes, that number may 
easily be exceeded. The butter and flour founda- 
tion termed a I^oux, white or brown (see vSauces) 
may be unduly repeated in one meal; in a thick 
soup, in sauces, with fish, entree, vegetables, fowl ; 
in souffles and savouries. 

Where meat is omitted from a menu, eggs, milk, 
butter or cheese (the most valuable of animal fcxxls) 
will make good the deficiency; or peas and beans, 
fresh or dried (the most valuable of vegetable foods) 
may be substituted. 

In cold weather food of a warming character 
(that is containing fat, sugars and starch) should 
be served, hot if possible; cocoa, oatmeal, porridge 
with cream, hot thick soups and stews, suet pud- 
dings are all typical cold-weather foods. On the 
other hand in warm weather food should be light; 
clear soups, fish, poultry, eggs, junkets, vegetables, 
salads and much fruit. A hurried meal should 
always be liglit and short, one that is easily eaten 
and digested. 

I""ruit is a most valuable and necessary food, it is 
frequently advisable to substitute it for pudding, 
where both cannot be provided. 

Where one pair of hands does the work of a house 
or flat the catering must be carefully planned, so 
that sufficient time is allowed for good cocking; 
and no menus should be drawn up which cannot be 
successfully carried out. (It is well to remember 
that well cooked food is an essential, the polishing 
of silver a non-essential.)

THE ART OF SHOPPING 






THE art of slioppiiig is to get the best 
possible value for the smallest possible 
expenditure. It is always advisable that 
a housekeeper should personally choose the daily 
ffxDd ; where means are limited it is absolutely 
essential. Experience only can teach how to 
recognise quality and condition, to determine the 
quantity of food required and to know what prices 
are reasonable. 

With food the golden rule is to buy the best of 
everything, 'the best' meaning quality, not size or 
fashion. It is sometimes the most expensive; but 
always the most economical in use ; there is more 
value and satisfaction in a small quantity of good 
material than in a large quantity of poor quality. 
Who would hesitate between one new laid egg and 
two doubtful eggs? All food should be fresh, it is 
then palatable, wholesome and nourishing, and less 
of it is required. Sliopkeepers are to blame in 
allowing so much good material to deteriorate and 
waste; all perishable goods should be renewed daily, 
since dangerous chemical changes rapidly take place 
in many foods through being kept in stock. W^hat 
is good to-day may be indigestible to-morrow and 
poisonous the day after. 'The stomach is lord of 
the body,' and it does not pay to chea^ him.

^ll^uld be firm, the lean darker than beef, the fat 
'\ inter and harder. Lamb, an immature meat, is 
ligliter in colour than mutton. Veal, also an imma- 
ture meat, should be very light in colour, as it is 
})led, and must be small. l*ork should be dairy fed, 
small, firm, and with a thin skin. Bacon of gofxl 
quality is firm, the fat a clean white, the lean a 
j;(H)(l red. In the chapter on Meat, joints and 
pieces suitable for a small family are given. 

A chicken should have a smooth skin ; when the 
bird is young the end of the breast bone is gristle 
and is easily bent. Game that is tainted should 
never be purchased. A young rabbit has soft ears 
and sharp claws, the inside is a bright pink. 

Root vegetables, such as potatoes, cirrots, onions 
at their best when young and freshly- dug, may be 
bought in quantities and kept in a wire vegetable 
stand, they should always be firm : Green vege- 
tables should be fresh and crisp. Fruit, ripe and 
sound, is an important item in the day's cater- 
ing. Unripe fruit is usually bought for cooking. 
Bruised fruit is dear at any price, the damaged 
parts are waste and the remainder is often unwhole- 
some. vSoft fruits, such as pears, greengages, med- 
lars, and all berries should be carried home in 
baskets or trays, and not in paper bags The best 
methods of growing, packing and delivering are 
encouraged by purchasers insisting on all fruit 
being sound and in good condition. 

Dried fruits are at their best at the beginning

Tlir: KITCHEN AND UTENSILS 



Till] kitchen should Ik- arranged uitli due 
regard to convenience, and ease in keep- 
ing clean. It should have got)d fitted 
cupboards an-' shelves ; the tloor should be cov- 
ered with linoleum, the walls with a light wash- 
able distfsnpcr, or varnished paper. A wash- 
ing curtain should be adopted in preference to 
a blind as it takes oflf less light. A rod of light 
brass should be fixed about six inches below the 
top of the window, so that steam and smell may 
escape even when the curtain is drawn. In smo]-y 
towns a strip of tine wire gauze should be fitted at 
the top of the window frame to keep out smuts. 
The table should be of a convenient height, covered 
with a light linoleum, or American cloth. Both 
table and chairs should be fitted with Domes of 
Silence, for easy moving. The dresser should be 
stained, varnished or painted. Soft white wood is 
not easy to keep clean, or to dry. 

The Stove. A stove for cooking should be placed 
in a convenient position for light, and should 
stand out from the wall. It is wi.se to learn the 
construction and working of the stove one has to 
use. Where gas is available a cooker should be 
hired from the local gas company. One of the 
latest improvements is a plate-rack with an enamel-

to be had ; knives are easily cleaned if done at 
once. 

A thick apron ; a leather one is a good investment. 

The sleeves should be well tucked-up. Every- 
thing should be arranged neatly and the meanest 
things washed first, such as glasses, these often 
require only a rinse, dry and polish. Then silver : 
wipe spoons and forks with soft paper, wash, rinse, 
drain, dry and polish. Next cups and saucers, 
dishes and plates; scrape ofif all pieces, and when 
greasy wipe them over with paper. All china is 
washed with the mop, then rinsed, drained, dried 
and polished. There is an art in drying, a final 
light rub gives a polish to china. 

Knives are wiped with soft paper, dipped in the 
soda-water, rirsed and drained. They clean easily 
when damp, and require careful rubbing afterwards 
in order to remove all powder. Earthenware pans 
are wiped out with paper; then washed with a pot 
brush, rinsed and turned over to dry. To clean 
metal pans, first wipe them out, if necessary boil up 
with water and soda, then use a pot brush or flat 
wire brush. This latter is a most effective cleaner, 
it must be used flat, and cleans both the outside 
and inside of pans and kettles. 

It is not practical to keep utensils that are in 
daily use in a high state of polish. Where labour 
is limited and time valuable, an array of 'kitchen 
gods' on the mantelpiece is not to be encouraged. 
Those tins that are always used greased, such as 
cake tins, should be well rubbed with soft paper 
and not washed or polished. Wooden articles,

boards, spoons, etc., should if possible dry in the 
open air. They must never be put away damp. 

The Sink. There should always be a sink basket 
for pieces. If all dirty water is poured through 
this, there is no fear of a stoppage in the pipe. 4. 
sink cleaner (a small flat shov-1) is also useful. 
Boiling water should be poured down the pipe once 
a day, but where paper is used as suggested for 
rubbing over plates and dishes there is little grease 
left in the sink. Taps should i)e fitted with anti- 
splash nozzles.

A GOOD store Cupboard is a necessity. It 
should be well stocked at the start of 
house-keeping, and can then be kept up 
at a small weekly expenditure. A slate and pencil 
should hang in the cupboard, and a note be made of 
anything exhausted. There should be tins or jars 
to hold the groceries. 

The following list must be taken as suggestive 
only, no two households have the same require- 
ments. 
'l~ea. Coffee, Cocoa. Sugars : loaf, raw, castor. 
Flour, Cornflour, Paisley Flour, Baking powder, 
^.laccaroni, Spaghetti, Vermicelli, Italian Paste. 
Sago, Tapioca, Rice, Patna Rice, Pearl Barley, 

Oatmeal, Groats. 
liable Salt (jar or tin). Table Salt (id packet) for 
cooking. Mustard, Salad Oil, Malt Vinegar, 
Tarragon Vinegar, Chul'iey. Pickles, Pepper 
(white or black), Coralline Pepper, Cayenne, 
Peppercorns, Nutmegs, Cloves, Ginger, Carra- 
\:ays, Cinnamon. 
Sauces : Anchovy, Tomato, Worcester, Mush- 
room. 
Glaze (glass jar), Lemco, Marmite, Curry Pow- 
der, Jam. 
Essences : Lemon, Vanilla, Cherr\-, Raspberry.

THE LARDER 

THE Larder, or Sate for the kccpiug of food, 
should be so jjlaccd thit fresh air circulates 
freely through, tlie windows fitted with 
tine wire gauze, and when necessar}- lined with 
white muslin, which is easily removed for washing. 
The danger of flies as carriers of germs is now well 
understood, and they must be kept out of the larder. 
Walls should be lime-washed, or have a varnished 
paper. The floor should be tiled, or if of wood, 
covered with linoleum, the shelves covered with 
white American cloth, or linoleum, both easily 
wiped over. 

Milk should be kept in jugs or basins, with alu- 
minium or muslin covers. Butter should be kept 
in a cooler, the water renewed daily. Eggs should 
be kept on a wooden stand. Fine wire gauze dish 
covers should be provided for meat, a crock or 
other pan for bread (to be emptied regularly) and a 
wire stand for vegetables. 

The contents of the larder should all be seen and 
smelt daily, and nothing kept that has a suspicion 
of taint. An important point is that nothing 
should be put away in the larder while hot.

COOKERY METHODS AND THEIR 
PRINCIPLES 

TflK chief methods used in cookery are • — 
I^oaotiny, drilling, Boiling, Steaming. 
Stewing, Braising, Frying, and Bakiu- 
^^.t]l mo.t of tliese methocis the principle Ts 
the same, namely, to keep in the juices and 
goodness of what is being cooked. With that 
object in view the procedure is the same w'th 
each method; to expose at once to great heat in 
order to scorch the outside. In most cases the heat 
is reduced after about ten minutes, so as to avoid 
cooking too quickly and hardening throughout 
Stewing IS a method always used where food is 
tough ; the long, slow cooking softens hard fibres 
the juices lost from the meat are found in the 
gravy. In Stock-making, the principle is to draw 
out the juices, etc., from meat and bones, first by 
soak.ng in cold water, tlien by graduallv warming 
up and digesting. 

Roasting.- Properly speaking this is cooking 
m front of a fire, the meat hanging on a hook*! 
Fires are now much reduced in size, ovens (those 
of Gas Cookers especially) well ventilated, and, with 
care, roasting in the oven is excellently done. With 
these advantages, less heat is necessary-, the meat 
requires less basting, and loses less in "weight. lu 

28 



t ^' 1 ■■fti- 



COOKERY METHODS AND PRINCIPLES 



cither case the principle is the same, the meat is 
exposed to great heat for the first ten minutes, in 
order to harden the albumen on the outside, to 
close the pores, to form a skin which will keep in 
the juices of the meat. The heat is then reduced, 
and cooking finished slowly, or the meat would 
harden all the way through. 

If a fire is used, it is made up to a clear red 
liL-at. If a C,as Oven, the burners are lit, turned 
Mil full (or nearly so, according to the pressure of 
the gas), the door closed, and in ten minutes it will 
be ready for use. The meat is placed on a stand in 
a baking tin; or on an earthenware baking dish. 
These dishes are delightful in use, tiie fat does not 
splutter or burn, they can be sent to table, and are 
easily cleaned. A good deal of dripping or otlier 
fat must be put on and round the meat, and the 
tin or dish must be large enough to allow room for 
basting. 

To baste is to pour melted fat over whatever 
is roasting, taking it up with a large metal spoon. 
A rough cloth should be put over the hand in case 
'if splashing, the oven door kept open for as short 
a time as possible. The more frequently basted 
the more juicy the meat will be, and the less it will 
lose in weight. Lean meat requires more basting 
than that which is fat. Where it is 'lot possible to 
give a roast constant attention, it should be covered 
o\er with a -veil-greased paper, vhich should be 
tucked ill all round. As an alternative, thick slices 
of fat bacon (all fat) may be tied or skewered on. 
'i'lu' same rules apply to the roasting of birds.

Baking.-All baking requires a hot oven. Bread 
pastry and cakes contain yeast, or Baking Pow- 
der. These when moistened and warmed generate 
a gas, which pushes up or raises the dough, 
n he heat of th. oven hastens this rising, and sets 
e raised bread or cake. If the heat istt suffid!

Broiling or Grilling.-This is the quickest of 
cookery- methods but suitable only for small pieces 
of meat, fish, etc. Grilling takes place over 

30 



COOKERY METHODS AND PRINCIPLES 

,„■ ill front of the fire, or in the case of gas, under 

grill made red hot. The principle in grilling (as 
in roasting) is to scorch the outside at once, forming 
a skin to keep in the juices. The gridiron is 
rul)l)cd over with fat to prevent sticking. The 
meat, fish, etc., to be grilled is brushed over with 
cil, liquid butter or fat. If thick, it is scored, 
cutting across with a sharp knife .so that the heat 
gets quickly through. The fish or meat is turned 
when brown on one side, a knife being used, as, if 
pricked with a fork, the juice will run out. \ grill 
must be served as soon as it is ready, in fact the 
table must wait for a grill. 

Boiling.— To boil is to cook in boiling water. 
Water boils at a temperature of .m2 degrees, when 
bubbles rise freely in the centre of the pan. To 
boil meat, it is placed in boiling water, and kept at 
the same temperature for ten minutes. The pnn- 
ciple is the same as in roasting and grilling, the 
hare' >ning of the albumen on the outside, thus form- 
ing a ,kin to keep in the juices. After ten minutes 
])oiling the heat is reduced and the meat simmered 
only until done. In simmering, bubbles rise slowly 
in a corner only of the pan. If meat is boiled all 
the time, it becomes tough, indigestible, and taste- 
less. All scum must be carefully removed (a little 
salt helps it to rise), or it may spoil the appearance 
of the meat, and will make the stock muddy. In 
boiling meat, fowl, etc., it is well to put any bones 
that have previously been removed at the bottom 
of the pan, the meat standing on them, or on a wire

COOKERY MFTHODS AND PRINCIPLES 

Steaming is boiliiij,' in steam. With meat, 
r,.,l,, birds, ,>iul(linKS, etc., it is, generally speaking, 
:ui easier method tha.i UnVin^ in water, and gives 
better results; flavour is retained, the tlesh is more 
tender, and less bulk and goodness are lost. A 
steamer is a tin pan, tlie bottom pierced with many 
holes, whieli fits over a sauce-pan. In the lower 
pan water is kept boiling, and the steam rising 
through the holes c(X)ks whatever is in the steamer. 
With a steamer two dishes can be cooked with the 
lieat and space required for one; for instance, meat 
may be boiling in the sauce-pan, potatoes in their 
skins or a pudding in the steamer. Or steaming 
may take place in a sauce-pan, placing the meat or 
pudding on a wire stand (see Boiling) so that it 
stands above the water and is cooked in steam. In 
steaming birds, the breast is covered with strong 
greased paper to keep off drops which fall from the 
lid. Steaming requires rather more time than 

boiling. 

Braising— True braising is cooking in a pan 
with heat above and bolov,-. A op.cial braising pan 
has a deep lid on which hot coals are placed. The 
same result is now attained by putting a casserole 
in the oven. The casserole is lined with fat bacon 
(sec recipes), a small quantity of water or stock is 
used, and cooking is very slow and gentle. When 
ready the stock should be reduced to a glaze. It is 
now usual, and in a small household more economi- 
cal, to reduce the time for braising, and to brush 
over the meat or bird with bou^'ht glaze. Meat is 
often braised on the top of the stove.

Stewing. -Tiiis i^ a slow process, producing 
savoury dishes, and a most useful one in a small 
establishment. A stew can be made early in the 
day and wanned up; it can be kept hot for a long 
time and, with care, rather improves than deterior- 
ates, an occasional stir being all it requires. It is 
wise to put an asbestos mat under the pan to pre- 
-ent sticking. In stewing, the meat, etc., is put in 
an earthenware or other pan with cold water, which 
1.^ very slowly brought up to simmering point (when 
the water bubbles slowly in a corner of the pan) 
and kept at that temperature. The time required 
will depend on the size and degree of hardness of 
meat or bird ; almost any ^ough meat can be made 
tender by stewing if given sufficient time (a spoon- 
ful of vinegar in the water helps to soften hard 
hbres). An Irish stew will take about two hours 
Ox tail requires four hours. It is easy to ascertain 
with a tork when the meat is tender. 

A brown stew is coloured by frving onions, meat 
etc., before stewing. In this stew the gravy is 
generally thickened with flour; this flour must be 
well cooked, th.e best plan being to fry it with other 
ingredients as given in recipes. 

In stewing much of the goodness is drawn into 
the gravy. As meat and gravv are eaten together 
there is no loss of nourishment. Stews should be 
served m the casserol. in which thev are cooked or 
m a deep dish ; and small soup plates are advisable 
so as to avoid waste of '

fat or oil. Watt-r boils at 212 degrees, fat boils at 
350 degrees (some oils reach a higher temperature), 
and at that heat cooks very quickly, and browns. 
In using fat, the high temperature must be kept in 
mind ; whatever is to be fried must be slipped in 
slowly and gently ; a splash means a burn, should 
the fat come into contact with lighted gas it will 
ignite. Water bubbles when it boils, fat is still 
and gives off a blue smoke when ready. It should 
then be at once used, or taken off the gas, or it 
quickly burns and spoils. All rendered animal or 
vegetible fats are good mediums for frying, pro- 
vided they are pure and contain no water, salt or 
other substance. As there must be sufficient to 
cover the article to be fried, the 'frying fat' should 
be started with about 2 lbs. of Hugon's block suet, 
or rendered fat (see directions). Once started this 
fat should be kept up, as it reduces with use, 
adding to it any raw fat trimmed off meat, after 
rendering. The frying fat is kept clean by taking 
off any scum rising to the surface, and carefully 
straining through a fine sieve after using, to remove 
crumbs, etc., which would otherwise burn and spoil 
the fat. Fat must be left to cool a little before 
straining, or the great heat may unsolder the 
strainer. It should not be put in the larder until 
cold. The same fat can be used over and over 
again. Whatever is to be fried (fish, rissoles, etc.) 
is rubbed in flour, egg and breadcrumb, or batter, 
etc. The great heat sets thi.s- at once, forming a 
skin ; so that the fat does not touch the substance 
of fish <.r meat, and cannot become flavoured. 
When the fat becomes a bad colour and exhausted,

])Ut into the lat wet, or the lat was not 'boiling' ; 
or too luch was put in at the same time, and the fat 
chilled. l''ried food should be served as soon as it is 
ready, or crispness is lost. No cover should be put 
on the dish. 

Dry frying. This is to cook in a fry pan with 
a small <iuantity of fat, dripping or butter (a 
method used for chops, steaks, onions, pancakes, 
omelettes, etc.). The pan must be hot, and the fat 
must be smoking before anything is put in to fry. 

The principle in frying is to make a dry outside 
by flouring, etc. ; to plunge into boiling lat so that 
a skin is at once formed, keeping in the goodness 
of whatever is being cooked. The high tempera- 
ture of the fat makes fr\ing a quick process. 

To render fat for frying. Buy 2 lbs. of fat scraps 
(mixed), add any trimmings of raw fat that may 
be in Uie larder. Cut the fat in thin strips, put in 
an iron saucepan with a small quantity of water, 
just to prevent burning. Stir occasionally with a 
steel fork or knife. Simmer till, the water having 
evaporated, the pieces of skin brown, curl up and 
float in the oil. Cool the fat and .strain into a 
special basin or pan, it will be white and hard when 
cold. 

To clarify dripping. The fat that drips from a 
joint during the process of roasting is called drip- 
ping. When cold this fat is taken off the gravy 
and the under side scrai)ed to remove any brown 
pieces that may adhere. Dripping is generally 
used for dry frying. If the fat becomes too dark 
in colour it may be clarified by putting it in a 
pan, covering with boiling water and just bringing 

37 






THE ONE MAID BOOK OF COOKERY 

it to hoiliug point. When quite the fat is 

easily lifted, tiie under side scraj .md all im- 
purities will he left in the water. 

Stock making. TIil making of stock differs 
troni other methods of C(x-)ker3- i" that the object is 
to draw out all juices and goodness by slow simmer- 
ing, or digesting, instead of to keep them in. 
.Stock is generally made with raw meat, or bones, 
fish and lish bones, vegetables, etc. An earthen- 
ware marmite, or casserole, makes an excellent 
stockpot, and is easily cleaned. Nothing should 
remain in a stockpot over night. In making stock 
the bones are broken as small as possible, meat 
without fat is cut up small. These are covered 
with cold water, put over a gentle heat, and sim- 
mered lor two or three hours. The water should 
never reach boiling point. If allowed to boil, the 
meat will harden and no more goodness will be 
extracted from it. If the stock is kept on too long, 
or boiled, the smell is often offensive, and the stock 
muddy. All scum must be carefully taken off as 
It nse^, the putting in of .salt helps to bring it to 
the surface. If the scum is removed two or three 
times the stock should be clear and fit for ordinary 
use. Vegetables to flavour are best put in the last 
hour of simmerin-, they give a stale taste to the 
stock if over cooked. When read v. stock is strained 
into a basin, and put in the larder when cold, any 
fat will then float on the surface and can be easily 
removed. All stock should possess food value 
whether used for soup or gravies; it is better to 
have a small quantity of good stock than a large 
one of poor stuff.

SOUPS 

STOCK is the foundation of most soups and 
gravies, and is best made in an earthen- 
ware niarmite or stcwpot, which must be 
emptied daily. To make stock, raw meat freed 
from fat is cut small, bones of meat, poultry, 
yarae, rabbits (cooked or uncooked) are brok'Mi 
up, and covered with cold water. The pan is 
put over gentle heat, and very slowly brought 
up to simmering point, when the water bubbles 
gcntlv on one side of the pot. vSalt is now 
added, all scum is carefully removed as long as any 
rises, and the stock is left to simmer very gently 
for three or four hours. If the bones are already 
cooked, simmer for not more than two hours. The 
last hour add a scraped carrot, an onion stuck with 
cloves, and half a dozen peppercorns. \\'hen the 
stock is ready, pour it through a wire strainer into 
a basin. When it is cold remove all fat, which will 
be floating on the surface, and the stock is ready 
for ordinary use. It should look clear and clean. 
A small quantity of Lemco (Meat Extract) or Mar- 
mite (Vegetable Extract) or a few drops of Caramel 
will improve the colour if necessary. Caramel is 
made by browning a lump of sugar in an old iron 
spoon, holding it over heat till it takes the required 
colour. If stock is cooked at too great a heat, the 



1 



^;i

albumen in meat is hardened, and the juices are not 
extracted. It it is overcooked, gallo]X'd, or not well 
skimmed, the result is an offensive smell, and a 
muddy, stale tasting liquor. A small quantity ot 
good stock is of greater value than more of an 
inferior quality. The water in which meat, poul- 
try, rabbits and hsli have been boiled forms stock. 
Fish bones and skin and coarse fish will make a 
good stock for tish soups. The water in which peas 
and beans ha\c been boiled is a vegetable stock. 
vSoups must al\\a\s have food value. Where the 
stock is thin and poor, it can be enriched by adding 
butter, milk, egg, cheese, meat extract, vegetables, 
sauces and ..tarches, etc., as required. The clear- 
ing of soup removes much of the goodn- ss and 
flavour; therefore, stock used for a clear soup must 
be strong.

FISH 

FISH shuuUl be very fresh. Herrii\gs, 
Mackerel and Sprats especially so. A 
fish when fresh is stiff, the skin and 
eyes are bright, the gills are red, and the 
smell is not unpleasant. In warm weather, 
or when packed, the condition of a fish rapidly 
deteriorates, and it may be necessary to wash it in 
vinegar and cold water to restore the stiffness; 
otherwise rinse the inside of the fish under the tap 
after cleaning, or wipe it with a piece of wet tissue 
paper only. A small fish is sweeter than a large 
one. For a small household it is always advantage- 
ous to buy slices or the tail end of a small fish. 

To skin a flat fish. Place the fish on a hard 
'.;oard, with a sharp pointed knife cut across the 
tail, loosen the dark skin with the right thumb 
dipped in salt, hold the fish flat with the left hand, 
and draw the skin off towards the head. There is 
no difficulty in this, provided the fish is fresh, the 
skin moist and the knife kept very sharp and wet. 
The dark skin of a sole is removed by the fish- 
monger, but not that of either lemon sole or plaice, 
making all the difference in their flavour and 
delicacy. 

To fiUe* a flat fish. After removing the dark 
skin, cut down the backbone, slip the knife under 

49 



■■ ti 






THE ONE MAID BOOK O: ^C^KERY 

the flesh, keeping close to the bone, uH tlie fins are 
reached. Cut a fillet off each side, tm.. thp fish 
over, and cut off two more fillets, making four to 
each fish. If these are too large they can be divideil. 

To fillet other fish. Whiting is especially good 
when filleted. Whiting, herring, mackerel, had- 
dock, etc. : Cut down the back with a sharp knife, 
lift the flesh carefully off the bone, making two 
fillets to each fish. These can be divided if pre- 
ferred. 

Time for cooking fish. It is impossible to give 
accurate times, which must depend ou the thick- 
ness and character of the fish. An average time is 
ten minutes to each lb. and ten minutes over. A 
2 lb. flat fish is much thinner than 2 lbs. centre cut 
of cod, and will therefore cook more quickly. The 
flesh of salmon is firm and substantial, and requires 
longer cooking than equal weight of any other fish. 
Fish must always be well done. To test take a 
sharp pointed knife and make a small cut in the 
thickest part, close to the bone. If the fish is ready 
the flesh will come away easily, and there will be 
no sign of blood. In frying fish, a thin fish ^r 
fillet is ready when a golden brown; a thick slice 
must take a darker colour. 

To boil fish. This is a method which loses much 
of the goodness and flavour of the fish, and is not 
to be recommended. If fish must be boiled, put 
salt and a little vinegar in the water before putting 
in the fish, and never let it do more than simmer. 
If a fish kettle is used, the strainer can be raised 
on short legs, and the handles shortened. The fish 

50 



FISH 



will then couk in bteaiii without touching the water 
(as below). 

To steam fish. Rub the fish over with a piece of 
kiuoii. Fold it in well buttered, strong, grease- 
pnxjf paper. Place it in a steamer (or on a raised 
strainer, as above) over slowly boiling water. This 
is a conservative mode of cooking, and nothing is 
lost. The liquor in the paper is used iu the sauce. 
To cook fish in the oven. This is an easy and 
conservative mode of cooking, the fish loses none of 
its tlavour or goodness. Use a fireproof or earthen- 
ware dish, just large enough to take the fish (or a 
till). Melt a good piece of butter in it, lay in the 
fish, season with salt, pepper, and a good squeeze 
of lemon. If a thick piece of fish, put small dabs 
of butter on the top. Cover with a strong greased 
paper, large enough to tuck in, and cook in a warm 
uven till the flesh comes away from the bone easily. 
The heat should not be great enough to burn the 
paper or colour the fish. It can be served in the 
dish in which it is cooked, a teaspoon of anchovy, 
.shrimps, or chopped capers added to the liquor 
(which consists of essence of fish, butter, and lemon 
juice). Or dish the fish, and serve with a white 
sauce to which the fish liquor has been added. Fisli 
done in this way is often called 'boiled,' as though 
cooked iu the oven it is not allowed to colour. 

To fry fish. The following are suitable mediums 
for frying fish :— Rendered fat, lard, oil, Hugon 
Suet (in blocks), Palmine, and other vegetable fats. 
About 2 lbs. are required, there must be enough to 
cover the fish. The fat should be added to occa-

sioually, and care taken that it docs not burn, and 
it will last a considerable time. I'at must always 
be strained before puttinij; away, letting it first cool 
a little. An unlined steel stewpan which will take 
the frying basket is the best in which to cook small 
fish and fillets. Or a deep oval fry pan, with a 
wire slice for lifting and draining. The fat is ready 
for use when quite still and smoking freely, it has 
then reached a temperature of about 350 degrees. 

To egg and breadcrumb fish. Dry the fish, and 
rub in sea.soned Hour (a tablespoon flour, a teaspoon 
salt, J^ teaspoon pepper). Make crumbs by rub- 
bing stale bread through a sieve on to a paper. 
Beat au egg on a plate ; use a brush and cover the 
fish with egg, lay it in the crumbs, covering well, 
and batting them on with the hand. Put the fish 
carefully in the smoking fat, using the frying 
basket if convenient, avoid splashing. When the 
fish is a golden brown (a thick slice must take a 
darker colour) lift it out with a basket or wire spoon, 
holding a minute over the pan to let the fat run off. 
Place the fish on soft crumpled paper to drain. 
iMsh fried in deep fat docs not get dry, so does not 
require a sauce. Dish on a paper, garnish with 
raw or fried parsley, and quarters of lemon. PVied 
fish should be served a.s soon as ready, and must not 
be covered, or the crispncss will be lost. 

Fish may also be dipped iu milk and well floured 
or crumbed, or covered with a batter for frying. 

GARNISH FOR FISH

MEAT 



THE highest priced pieces of meat are the 
most economical to buy. For small house- 
holds, mc-at should be cut ofT small beasts. 

In cold weather, or when out of cold storage, 
meat should be kept in the kitchen to thaw slowly 
for some time before cooking. In hot weather meat 
may require the outside trimmed off, and washing 
with vinegar and water. It should never be cooked 
if tainted after this trimming and washing. 

Meat should be carefully looked over before cook- 
ing. All impurities, blood vessels, dried skin, 
visible muscles and sinews removed. The meat 
should be wiped over with wet tissue paper if 
necessary. All excess of fat should be cut olT, in 
mutton especially (this will be rendered for frying). 
A butcher usually chops bones, but it is well to .see 
that this has been properly done. Joints should be 
shaped with a view to easy carving. Wood skewers 
taken out, and replaced oy steel, which are readily 
removed with a fork. 

To bone is to cut the bones out of the flesh in 
tne neatest manner possible. A sharp pointed 
knife, and a firm board being necessary. Printed 
'lircotions arc difiUcult to follow, but in practice the 
nrt is finifp nn easv one. When meat is to be boued

it must not be previously chopped. Many small 
joints, such as loins, best end of neck of mutton or 
veal, a small shoulder of lamb, or half shoulder of 
mutton are specially good and economical when 
boned and stuffed. 

The following joints are suitable for a small 
household : — 

BEEF

MEAT 

To Broil or Fry. Cutlets, Mutton or Lamb, are 

cut from the Best End of the Neck (chined). 

It is well to ask for as many bones as cutlets 

required. Kidneys, Sweetbreads. 
To Grill. Mutton Chops, Lamb Chops. 
To Braise. A small Shoulder of Lamb, boned ana 

stuffed. A Breast of Lamb or Mutton, not too 

fat. Sweetbreads. 
Welsh or Mountain Mutton, when in season, is 

very small and sweet. Canterbury Lamb is 

small, and not too fat. 

VEAL 
Small Veal is far more delicate and tender than 

large, and easily digested. 

To Roast The Blade half of a Shoul t or 
Oyster. A piece of Fillet 'the bone taken out, 
the hole filled wi. . Forcemeat or a piece of fat 
Bacon), a small Loin boned and stuffed. 

To Boil. A Knuckle (from the shoulder) with 
sufficient meat on it. The bones should be 
broken in two places, but the flesh not cut. 
Weight, about 3 or 4 lbs., it is mainly bone. 
The liquor makes good broth. Half a Calf's 
Head (small), Calves Feet. Sweetbreads. 

To Braise. The Best End of the Neck, boned, 
stuffed and rolled. Breast. Sweetbreads. 

To Vry. Veal Cutlet. Liver. Sweetbreads.

THE ONE MAID BOOK OF COOKERY 

Pork is best bought from a dairy. The skin is 

always scored for roasting. 

To Roast. 2 or 3 lbs. of Loin. A small leg. 

To Boil. Hrlf a Hand (Shoulder) or small Hand, 
salted. A piece of Flank. The Cheek or Chap 
is generally sold ready boiled, and is eaten 
cold, being very fat. A whole Ham is too large 
for a small household. A corner can be bought 
weighing 3^/^ to 4 lbs., and is excellent eatirg 
hot and cold. 

To Fry. Chops may be fried or grilled. Break- 
fast Bacon is generally Back or Streaky. If 
only a lb. or so is bought it is a good plan to 
have it cut in Rashers, thick or thin, as it is 
not easy to cut well with a small piece. vSaus- 
ages are best bought from a dairy, and must 
be good and fresh. They should be fried till 
a dark brown in fat deep enough to cover them. 



ROAST BEEF 

Take 2 lbs. Fillet of Beef, which will take about 
three-quarters of an hour to roa.st. Trim, and 
make into good shape for carving, a Fillet is carved 
down, not across. Put dripping in an earthenware 
baking dish, place the meat in on a stand, and more 
dripping on the beef. The oven must be very hot 
for the first ten minutes, the heat then reduced. 
Baste constantly. When the meat is sufficiently 
brown, remove the iron sheet from above it. When 
the beef is ready, place it on a hot dish, pour 
gravy round, and garnish with watercress, or baked 

64 



MEAT 



Tomatoes. For the gravy; if good stock is avail- 
able, warm it up, season and brown. Or, after 
dishing the beef, pour off the fat, put a little water 
in the baking dish, add some salt. Boil it up on 
the top of the stove, smoothing out with a knife any 
brown pieces sticking to the dish. Add a little 
Extract of Meat and pour the gravy through a fine 
strainer round the meat. Small joints do not make 
sufficient good gravy, it always requires adding to 
and improving. 

The Fillet may be served in the baking dish in 
which it has cooked. Lift the meat, pour away the 
fat, replace the meat, and pour hot gravy round. 
Small potatoes, which shoulc be kept whole, may 
be cooked in with the meat. Or they may be par- 
boiled and finished in the dripping. Meat cooked 
in an earthenware dish is particularly good. 

ROAvST MUTTON 

Mutton requires rather more cooking than Beef, 
and must always be well done and brown. Serve 
with Onion Sauce or Red Currant or Blackberry 
Jelly. In winter Dried Haricot Beans as a vege- 
table. 



ROAST LAMB 

Should be very well cooked and brown, 
generally served with Mint Sauce. 



It is 





ROAST YEAL 

Must be thoroughly cooked right through, and

having little fat requires constant basting. It is 
served with rolls of Bacon (unless stuffed). Garnish 
with quarters of Lemon. Spinach or Tomatoes for 
vegetable or Sea-kale. 

ROAST PORK 

To be digestible, Pork must be well cooked right 
through. It requires a very hot oven (or the 
crackling will not crisp) and the heat must be kept 
up. Serve with Apple Sauce. Baked or boiled 
Onions, or Greens. 

BOILED MUTTON OR LAMB 

Take about 2 lbs. of the Best End of Neck of 
Mutton (previously chined, and the rib bones 
chopped short). It will take about an hour to boil. 
Remove the backbone, the sinew which lies along 
at the top of the meat, and a muscle which is easily 
found. Cut out the short bones, folding the flap 
underneath to make the joint a good shape. Cut 
or tear off all superfluous fat (to be rendered). 
Very little boiled mutton fat can be eaten. Put the 
bones in a Ccsscrole with cold water. When it 
comes up to the boil add salt, skim well, and put in 
the meat. The water should touch but not cover 
the meat. Add vSpanl 'i Onions (as many as are 
required for Sauce) stuck with two or three Cloves, 
Carrots, Turnips, and half a dozen Peppercorns. 
Boil fast for ten minutes, and take off all scum. 
Reduce the heat, and simmer till the meat is done. 
Serve on a hot dish, pour over a good Onion Sauce 
(using the onions cooked with the meat) or Parslev 

6b 



MP 



MEAT 

Sauce, or Caper Sauce. Garnish with Carrot and 
Parsley. If the vegetables are small and young 
put them in later to avoid overcooking. The liquor 
makes good broth. A small shoulder of lamb will 
boil as above. 

BOILED VEAL 

A knuckle, weighing 3 or 4 lbs. (mainly bone) 
has Oyster or Parsley Sauce poured over aud served 
in a Sauce Boat. Small rolls of Bacon may be 
served with it. Garnish with Carrots and Parsley. 
Time to boil, about ij^ hours. The Hquor makes 
good Broth. 

BOTLr'D DEEP 

Take 2 or 3 lbs. of Salt Brisket, wliich will 
require about an hour and a half to boil. Wash the 
meat, to remove the salt on the outside. Put it in 
an earthenware saucepan with warm water to cover 
and simmer slowly. Take off the scum as long as 
any rises. Put in Onions (stick with Cloves), whole 
Carrots and Turnips, being careful they are not 
overcooked. The meat being salted and hard 
requires very slow cooking in order to make it 
tender. Dish with the vegetables round, and serve 
with steamed floury Potatoes or Potato Snow. If 
the meat is to be eaten cold, cooking should con- 
tinue till the bones slip out easily. It is then 
pressed between two boards, with weights on the 
top, and left till next day, when it is trimmed and 
glazed. Some of the liquor if not too salt may be 
used in the making of Pea Soup.

BOILED BACON 

Take a Corner, weighing 3^ to 4 lbs. which 
will require 2 hours to simmer, and about half an 
hour or more to rise to that point. This meat is 
cured and smoked, and dried, so will require .some 
hours soaking according to dryness. Put the 
Bacon in a stcwpan, cover with cold water, bring it 
very slowly to boiling point, skim thoroughly, and 
do not let the water again rise above simmering. 
An Onion, Carrot, and Turnip, and Peppercorns 
put in the second hour, improve the flavour. When 
the Corner is cooked take off the skin, cover thickly 
with Brown Crumbs. Garnish with Carrot and 
Parsley. Serve some of the liquor as gravy, 
improved with a small quantity of Meat Extract 
and Sherry. Serve broad Beans when in sea.son. 
Butter Beans or Haricot Beans in the winter. 
Serve hot the first day. The lean and fat should 
be cut together to avoid waste. 



Carrots, Onions, Turnips

An Ox Tail require.«^ about 4 hours stewing to 
make it tender. This is a brown stew. Cut the 
tail in neat pieces, and rub in seasoned Flour. 
Melt a little dripping in a fry pan, when smoking 
put in the meat, and brown on both sides. Have 
a Casserole part full of warm water, put the meat 
in as it is ready fried. Fry the onions in the fat 
(adding a little more if necessary), cut in thick 
rings if large, keep whole if small. Add these to

little water from the stewpan. vStir this well, let it 
boil up, and add to the stewpan. Add Carrots and 
Turnips cut in slices, in the last hour. Remove all 
fat and scum as it rises. Simmer the Oxtail till the 
llcsh will come ofT the bones easily. Serve in a deep 
dish and use soup plates. If a small quantity only 
is left over it may be thinned down next day and 
will make soup. 

STEWED STEAK 
Rump vSteak, i lb. Onions, Carrots, Turnips 

The Steak may be cut in pieces, or left whole. 
Rub it in seasoned Flour, heat a little dripping in 
a casserole, put in the Steak, and fry brown on both

a sliced Spanish Onion; when this is brown, stir 
in what seasoned Flour remains, and fry, smooth- 
ing it with a knife. Add a teaspoon each of 
Worcester, Ketchup, Tomato, Anchovy Sauces, as 
much water as is required, and boil for a few 
minutes. Put the »Steak back in the pan, and 
simmer very gently for about two hours. When 
the stew is half done put in Carrots and Turnips 
cut in thick slices. Take off all scum as it rises. 

For lunch serve in a casserole, using small soup 
plates. Maccaroni and Tomatoes may be substi- 
tuted for Carrots and Turnips.

POULTRY AND GAME 



IN towns Poultry and Game are sold prepared, 
ready for cooking, and when service and 
space are limited it is always advisable to 
send birds to a poulterer to be dressed, when 
possible. If this has to be done at home, a lesson 
should be taken in plucking, cleaning, and truss- 
ing. These processes require to be seen. The art 
of Boning birds is easily learnt by demonstration 
followed by practice, but it is not easy to make 
printed directions clear. 

To Choose a Fowl. VHien a fowl is young the 
end of the breast bone is gristle and bends easily, 
the legs are smooth and the claws break readily if 
turned back. For roasting, a bird must be young. 
An old bird will eat well if boiled, or braised very 
slowly for two or three hours, till tender, and 
flavoured with vegetables. Or it can be boned, 
stuffed and braised till tender, pressed between 
boards till cold, making a galantine. An old bird 
makes excellent soup. All poultry must be thor- 
oughly cooked, the time required must vary accord- 
ing to the size and age of a bird. 

Game is hung in order to make it more tender. 
The length of time depending on the situation of 
the larder, and on the temperature. If the weather 
is hot or damp, the birds are soon high. No game

is fit for food that is tainted. Wild birds have as 
a rule no fat, therefore require to be well basted. 
Small birds are served on toast, and are often 
cooked on it. Potatoes served with game are 
always fried. 

RUAST CHICKEN 
Truss the fowl with steel skewers, these are 
easily removed. Place it on a stand in an earthen- 
ware dish, or baking tin. Cover with dripping, 
and put a piece inside the bird. The oven should 
be very hot for ten minutes, the heat may then be 
reduced. Baste constantly; if this is not possible, 
cover the breast of the bird as soon as it is l^rown, 
with a strong grc ised paper. Allow three quarters 
of an hour, an hour or more, for cooking, according 
to the size of the bird. Rolls of bacon, sausages 
(cooked with the bird), brown gravy, or bread 
sauce, may be served. But if the bird is fat and 
well roasted it is excellent served with a salad only, 
or garnished with watercress. 



if 



l^AISED FOWL 
Take a casserole just large enough to hold the 
bird. Cover the bottom with slices of fat bacon, 
add thick slices of onion, carrot and turnip, and 
pu' in the fowl. Cover the pan and let it cook on 
the top of the stove for 15 minutes. Now add a 
pint (more or less) of hot water. Cover the breast 
of the bird with greased paper (to avoid drops fro-n 
the lid) aad simmer an hour or more according to 
the size and age of the fowl. Dish the bird, wipe

the breast with soft paper and brush over with 
glaze. Put the vegetable' round the dish; take 
some of the stock for gravy, stirring it wih the 
glaze brush. Serve with green peas. Sausages or 
bacon if wished. 

An old bird will require at least two hours 

braising. 

BOILEE POWL 

Put the neck, scaldc.. feet, gizzard, &c., of the 
Fowl, in a casserole, and cover with cold water. 
Bring it slowly to the boil, take off the scum, and 
put in the Fowl, standing it on the bones. Rub the 
breast over with half a Lemon, and cover with 
greased paper. Put in Carrots, whole, or cut in 
thick slices. Turnips, an Onion or more, stuck 
with Cloves, Salt and Peppercorns, and simmer 
gently for an hour if the bird is young. Or two 
hours or more if an old bird. Dish the Fowl, pour 
over it a good White Sauce, decorate quickly with 
a hard boiled yolk of egg rubbed through a wire 
strainer, or with Chopped Parsley, or with small 
pieces of lean Ham or Tongue. 

Or the Chirken may be brushed over with glaze 
and served with a brown gravy. It will be noticed 
that the bird is steamed, and not boiled. The 
water touches, but does not cover it. 

Pickled Pork, Bacou, or a Bath Chap, may be 
served with a boiled fowl. Hot Beetroot, Peas, 
1-rench i3eaus, or Carrots, as vegetable.

should be covered with a greased paper. A Turkey 
^•equires carefully basting. It may be stuiTcd with 
Sausage Meat, a Forcemeat, or with Chestnuts. 
Bread Sauce or Cranberry Sauce may be served 
with it. 

BOILED TURKEY 

A Boiled Turkey (see Boiled Fowl) is covered 
with a good White, Celery-, or Oyster Sauce, and 
is served with fried Sausages. The time required 
for cooking depends on the age and size of the 
bird. 

GUINEA FOWL 

A Guinea Fowl has little fat, therefore the breast 
is either larded or covered with slices of fat Bacon 
before roasting (see Roost Chicken). This bird 
requires careful basting ; a piece of dripping should 
be put inside. Bread Sauce and I'ried Crumbs 
may be served with it. Mushrooms and Fried 
Potatoes. 

A Guinea Fowl can also be brai.sed and glazed.

BOILED RABBIT AND PORK 

A Tame Rabbit Onion Sauce 

Pickled Pork, i lb. Peppercorn.'? 

Wash the Pork to remove the salt, put it in a 
saucepan, cover with water, and let it simmer for 
half an hour. Take ofT the scum. Cut off the 
head of the rabbit (it should not be sent to table). 
Truss it as near the shape of a chicken as possible. 
When the water in the pan boils put in the Rabbit 
with the Pork, add Onions (as many as are wanted 
for sauce), a Carrot, and Peppercorns, and simmer 
for an hour 01 more according to age. Take out 
the onions as soon as thev are tender. Make 
Onion Sauce, and pour over the rabbit when dished. 
Garnish with Carrots and Parsley. Serve the Pork 
on a separate dish. A tame Rabbit has a better 
flavour and colour than a wild one ; it is more 
tender, and therefor^ cooked more quickly. 



RAGOUT OF RABBIT 

A Rabbit, wild or tame Onions 

Seasoned Flour Sausage or Forcemeat 

Cleanse the Rabbit carefully, and cut oflf the 
head. Cut off the forelegs, the back legs (which 
are cut in halves). Cut through the flesh, and 
divide the backbone into four or five pieces. Rub 
the pieces of Rabbit in seasoned Flour, and fry in a

small quantity of hot fat in a fry pan till brown on 
both sides. Put the pieces of rabbit, as they brown, 
in a casserole with hot water to cover, and simmer 
gently for about two hours. Fry Button Onions, 
Forcemeat or Sausage Balis in the frypan, and add 
to the stew the second hour. Make thickening by 
frying seasoned Flour in the fry pan, with a very 
little fat. vSmooth with a knife and let it brown 
(making a brown roux), add a teaspoon each of 
Worcester, Ketchup, Tomato and Anchovy Sauces, 
add a little stock from the stew pan ; brirg it up to 
the boil and pour in with the Rabbit. Small 
Tomatoes are excellent with this stew, they should 
be placed on the top of the meat, and allowed time 
to cook, but not lose their colour, or go to pieces. 
Serve the Rabbit in the casserole. 



ROAST HAPE 

A leveret should be chosen. The head must be 
cut off, the blood should not be used. Cleanse the 
Hare carefully. Put a pound of sausage meat in 
the body and sew it up. Truss the Hare as close 
and plump as possible, and tie on slices of fat 
Bacon. Place it in an earthenware dish, pour 
some milk round and place in the oven. Baste 
constantly. When the milk is exhausted use 
dripping to baste with. Time to roast, from one 
to one and a half hours. Make a good gravy, add a 
little Port Wine. Serve Red Currant or other Jelly 
with the Hare. Instead o^ Stuffing, Sausage or 
Forcemeat Balls may be browned, cooked with the 
Hare, and dished round it.

STEWED HARE 

A Hare is cut up in the same manner as a 
Rabbit, and stewed (as Rabbit Ragout). The 
casserole is put on the stove, or in the oven. 
Three or four hours gentle simmering will be 
required. Sausage or Forcemeat Balls are added 
the last hour, and Button Onions. The Gravy 
should be thick and rich. Add a wineglass of 
Port to it ten minutes before serving. Jugged 
Hare warms up well; or any left over may be 
thinned down for soup. The blood of the Hare 
should not be used. 

ROAST PHEASANT 

A Pheasant for roasting must be young. Tie 
fat Bacon ovei the breast, removing it later to let 
the bird brown. Roast quickly for 40 to 60 
minutes (see Roast Chicken). Serve with Bread 
Sauce, garnish with Fried Crumbs and Watercress. 

An old bird may be braised and glazed (see 
Braised Chicken). Or boiled and covered with 
Celery Sauce (see Boiled Chicken). 

GROUSE 
A Grouse is roasted on a piece of toast, with a 
lump of Butter inside, and requires good basting. 
Time, about 30 minutes sharp roasting (see Ror.st 
Chicken). Serve with Fried Crumbs, Mushrooms, 
and Fried Potatoes.

certainly be cleaned as other game. Roast ciuickly, 
and serve on Toast. 

BLACK GAME 

Blackcock and Greyhen, Ptarmigan, take longer 
to roast in proportion to their size than other game, 
and being dry birds require very careful basting. 
Serve with good gravy, to which a little Port is 
added. An Orange Salad is excellent with Black 
Game. 

WILD DUCK 

A Wild Duck requires about 20 or -jo minutes' 
sharp roasting. The gravy should have a little 
Port in it, and a teaspoon of Red Currant Jelly. 
Garnish with Watercress. Serve with an Orange 
Salad.

VEGETABLES 



VEGETABLES arc cooked in order to make 
them digestible and palatable, care being 
taken to preserve their food value, fla- 
vour and colour. Root Vegetables, Potatoes, 
Carrots, Onions, &c., are best when young 
and freshly dug. When old they may be kept 
some time in a wire vegetable stand, but are 
not fit for use once they are soft. Roots re- 
quire some soaking, and well scrubbing before 
cooking. They should be boiled whole if pos- 
sible, choosing all of the same size for a dish. 
The saucepan should be kept well covered. 
Potatoes should be cooked iu their skins or they 
lose much of their value. Large Potatoes are 
kept for baking or roasting, smaller ones, and 
those that ha\ ; to be cut and trimmed, are 
steamed, mashed, fried, &c. Old Potatoes re- 
quire long cooking to make them floury. No 
times can be given for the cooking of vegetables. 
These may be large or small, young or old, 
quickly or slowly grown, close or open, and 
require more or less time accordingly. The 
vegetables are cooked when a skewer goes easilv 
through the thickest parts. All root vegetables 
are improved by the addition of butter, when 
served.

I50ILKD ruTATOES ((M.D) 

Soak the Potatoes, and scrub them clean with 
a small brush. Put them in a saucepan with 
sufficient boiling water to cover; add a teaspoon 
of salt, cover, and cook quickly, till done. The 
skin can be removed before serving if liked 
Steaming is a better and easier process. 

STEAMED POTATOES 

Scrub the Potatoes, put them in a steamer over 
boiling water, cover and cook gently till done. 
Serve the Potatoes in their jackets for lunch. 
For dinner, remove the skins carefully, and 
sprinkle with salt. A steamer is a tin pan with 
holes in the bottom; it fits over an ordinary 
saucepan in which water is boiling. 



POTATO SNOW 

Take the skin off Steamed Potatoes, press 
them lightly through a masher into a hot vege- 
table dish. 



MASHED POTATOES 

Steam and snow the Potatoes as above. Add a 
good piece of butter or dripping, melted. Sea- 
son with pepper and salt; if liked, add a little 
cream or milk. Mix all lightly with a fork, and 
serve very hot. Or the Potatoes may be mashed 
with a fork in the saucepan, adding the butter 

and seasoning. 

86 



VEGETABLES 

POTATO MOULD 

Heap up the mixed and seasoned Mashed 
Potato on a greased fireproof dish. Rough it with 
a fork, put a little butter on the top, and brown in 
the oven, or under the grill. Or, put the Mashed 
Potato in a greased tin, bake in the oven till brown, 
and turn the mould out carefully. 

rOT.\TO BALLS 

-Idd the yolk of an egg to the Mashed Potato, mix 
'.veil, and leave it to get cold. .Shape the Potaco 
mixture into balls, flour the outside lightlj-, brush 
over with egg, cover with bread crumbs. Fry the 
balls in deep smokiug fat. Garnish with Parsley. 



POTATOES BAKED 

Take large Potatoes of an equal size. Scrub and 
dry them. Bake slowly for an hour or more. If 
the oven is verj^ hot the skin should be pricked with 
a fork, or a slit made round the middle of the 
Potato, or the skin may burst in cooking. These 
Potatoes should be dry and floury, and are especi- 
ally g(X)d eaten with Cold Meat. 

Or Potatoes can be baked in a 'Devil.' This is 
a double pan, top and bottom alike, in unglazed 
earthenware. It is used on the top of a stove, or on 
a gas ring. The Potatoes are scrubbed, dried, and 
put in the Devil. The pan is turned over occasion- 
ally in order to cook the Potatoes evenly. They 
should be dry and very floury. No water is put in 
this pan, and it is never washed.

NEW rOTATOEvS 

New Potatoes should be quite small and waxy, 
Kidneys are the best. wSoak in cold water and rub 
with a coarse cloth. Cook the Potatoes in boiling 
water, add salt, sometimes a sprig of Mint, and 
boil till a small skewer will just go through the 
centre. Drain, and put in a hot dish with a good 
piece of butter. New Potatoes are spoilt if over- 
cooked . 

FRIED POTATOEvS 

Old Potatoes arc the best for frying. Wash and 
peel them thinly. Cut into thin slices, or into sticks, 
making Chips ; or cut thick slices, and each slice 
round and round, making ribbons; or cut in small 
quarters. Heat deep frying fat in a stewpan till it 
smokes. Dry the Potatoes, a few at a time, in a 
cloth. Put them into the smoking fat, using the 
frying basket if convenient. Raise the basket a 
little till all the bubbling is over, and give an occa- 
sional shake to separate the Chips. When the 
Potatoes are crisp and a golden brown, lift up the 
basket, holding it over the pan for a minute. Turn 
the Potatoes on soft paper to drain. The fat must 
boil up again, and the process repeated till all are 
cooked, keeping the I'ried Potatoes hot on a tin. 
Serve at once on a disli paper, and sprinkle freely 
with salt. I'Vied Potatoes should not be covered. 



« 



CARROTS (OLD) 

Scrub the Carrots. The skin is very thin, so 
they are scraped and not peeled, unless old and 

88 



VEGETABLES 



cracked. Cook the Carrots whole in boiling salted 
water till tender; if large they will take an hour. 
Drain in a colander. Cut the Carrots in rather 
thick slices, melt a good piece of butter in the 
saucepan, put in the Carrots and shake them over 
the lire for a few minutes, but do not brown. Put 
the Carrots in a hot dish, sprinkle with pepper and 
salt, sometimes a little finely chopped Parsley. 

CARROTS (NEW) 

Wash and soak the Carrots. Put them in boiling 
salted water, and cook till tender. Strain, take off 
the skins. Finish with butter, as with old Carrots. 
Or, put the Carrots in a hot dish, and the butter 
and seasoning over them. 

TURNIPS 

Turnips, especially if young, have a thick rind. 
When the top is cut off a line is seen, all rind out- 
side this line must be removed or the Turnips are 
bitter. WHien Turnips are like a sponge or full of 
strings they are only good for flavouring. Put the 
Turnips in boiling salted water, and cook gently 
till tender. Drain and finish with butter. Or, if 
large, Turnips may be mashed with a good lump 
of butter and seasoning. 

ONIONS 

vSpanish Onions of a medium size are the best for 

boiling. Hold the Onion on a fork to take off the 

skin. Cook in boiling salted water, simmering 

gently for about an hour, or till tender, test with

a skewer and do not over-cook. Drain well, and 
serve in a hot dish, with a good piece of butter. 

BAKKD ONIONS 

vSkin the Onions, i^ut them on a fireproof dish 
with some dripping or butter. Bake in the oven 
till tender, basting occasionally with the fat, serve 
on the same dish. 

STEXMiD ONIONS 

Small or medium Onions can be stewed. Heat a 
little butter or dripping in a small casserole. Skin 
the Onions and let them brown over the fire in the 
fat. Add a small quantity of stock, and simmer 
till tender. Dish the Onions. Reduce the stock 
by boiling fast without a lid till little remains, stir 
in half a teaspoon of glaze. Pour this stock over 
the Onions. 

BEETROOT 

Wash carefully without breaking the skin, or the 
Beet will bleed. Cook gently in boiling salted 
water till tender. Take off the skin, cut in thick 
slices, pour melted butter over and serve hot. 
Small globe Beets are kept whole. Or cat the Beet- 
root cold with a dressing of vinegar. Beets are 
generally sold already cooked. 

PARSNIPvS 
These are scraped or peeled, according to age. 
Cook in boiling salted water till tender. Serve 
with a little butter. Or, after boiling, the Parsnips

and well seasoned. 

JERUSALEM ARTICHOKES 
Scrub and peel. Put a teaspoon of vinegar in 
the boiling salted water in which the Artichokes are 
cooked. Serve with melted butter poured over 






GREEN VEGETABLES 

All green stuff should be fresh gathered, and 
should not be cooked unless it is crisp. To crisp 
up, cut off the end of the stalk and stand in cold 
water. To wash, cover with water and put in a 
spoonful of salt to draw out all insects. Look well 
over before cooking. Green vegetables are gener- 
ally over-cooked in this country, the texture, colour, 
ana flavour spoilt. It is not possible to give accur- 
ate times for the cooking of green vegetables They 
may be large or small, old or new, quickly or slowly 
grown, close or open, and accordingly require more 
or less time for cooking. Greens should be drained 
oS immediately a skewer will go through the stalk. 
Ihere should always be enough resistance in a 
cooked vegetable to require mastication. If not 
over-done, the water hanging on cooked vegetables 
IS easily shaken off; the juice in vegetables is valu- 
able. If Greens are fresh the water does not usually 
begin to smell till they are ready cooked. The

water iu which Greens have been cooked sliouid be 
poured at once down a drain, and not in the sink. 
Green vegetables should be green when cooked. 
They are always put in salted and fast boiling 
water. The lid of the saucepan may be kept on for 
a minute or two after putting in the vegetables, but 
must be removed directly the water again boils. 
All scum should be taken off carefully. A lump of 
sugar should always be put in the water with green 
vegetables when cooking. 



CABBAGE 

Take off all coarse and discoloured leaves and 
cut off the bottom of the stalk. The Cabbage 
should lie for a short time in salted water in order 
to draw out all insects. Cut the bottom of the 
stalk across both ways about an inch deep, especi- 
ally if the heart is very close. Put the Cabbage in 
boiling salted water without a cover, taking off all 
scum. The water must boil fast all the time. Add 
a lump of sugar. Directly a skewer will go in 
the stalk, drain the Cabbage in the colander and 
shake off the water. Cut the Cabbage across both 
ways two or three times. Melt a good piece of 
butter in the pan, put in the cabbage, season, and 
shake over the fire for a few minutes. Dish and 
serve very hot. 

GREENS 

Greens are many and various. They are cooked 
and finished in the same way as Cabbage, and being 
small take a short time only.

The flower should be put downwards in the water 
at first, and care should be taken to avoid breaking 
it. All scum must be removed. After thoroughly 
draining, dish the Cauliflower, pour melted butter 
over, and season with pepper and salt.

Pick out all discoloured leaves, tear off the thick 
stalks and wash well (without bruising) in several 
waters, to get rid of grit. vSpinach is cooked with- 
out water. Pack it in a small saucepan, pushing 
well down, as it reduces very much in cooking. 
Sprinkle with salt, and turn over occasionally. It 
is cooked when the fork will go through the leaves, 
and takes only a few minutes. Drain in a colander, 
and shake well. Put it on a board, make it into a 
ball, and cut through with a chopping knife again 
and again till it is fine. Melt a good piece of butter 
in the pan, return the vSpinach, shake pepper and 
salt, and a pinch of white sr.gar. Stand the pan on 
the stove without a lid, shaking it occasionally till 
the Spinach is sufficiently dried. Serve very hot. 
Cream may be used instead of butter. Spinach 
when cooked should be a good green.

THE following are the vegetables generally 
eaten as salads. Lettuce, Endive, Water- 
cress, small Cress anc' Mustard, Toma- 
toes, Cucumber, Celery, Celeriac, Beet, Radish, 
Horseradish, Spring Onions, etc. French Gar- 
deners have introduced various other salads. 
The A-oung leaves of Dandelion, and Nastur- 
tium, and Nasturtium Seeds are , dible as salads. 
Salads are made of one or several vegetables, 
as convenient. All green stuffs for salads should 
be fresh gathered. To crisp up, cut off the 
end of the stalks, and stand in cold water. 
Salad Greens should be washed just before they are 
required (not soaked), well shaken, and dried. 
Lettuce is lightly torn, not cut. Beetroot (see to 
Boil), already cooked, is scraped, cut in slices, 
cubes, or (with a vegetable cutter) into balls.' 
Cucumber, which shouid be ripe, is peeled, cut in 
slices, cubes, or balls. Radishes are scraped, served 
whole, or cut up. Horseradish and Celeriac are 
peeled and finely scraped. Tomatoes are served 
whole if small, or cut in quarters or slices, and 
some of the jui'^p and seeds run off. If scalded they 
are easily skinned.

SAUCES— GRAVIES— FORCEMEATS 






THE making of a Sauce requires time and 
great care. Smoothness is a necessity, 
lumps mean undissolved and uncooked 
flour, and their sequence is indigestion. Sauces 
are not essentials, and a menu can easily be 
spoilt by the repetition of Sauces with the same 
foundation of butter and flour. Where time 
is valuable, Melted Butter (dissolved butter) or 
Maitrc d' Hotel Butter are quickly prepared, and 
always liked as a Sauce; for sweet dishes a 
Jam Sauce has the same advantages. In making 
a Sauce, the butter is weighed with a generous 
hand, the flour is weighed short. Should a Sauce 
be too thick (flours vary), more liquor must be 
added. Flour requires to be cooked, and not only 
to be thickened. A small pan and a wooden spoon 
are used in Sauce making. The smooth blending 
of butter and flour (making the foundation of a 
Sauce, a Roux, white or brown), the careful adding 
of the liquor, and thorough cooking of the flour, 
forms an important process in cookery. The same 
process is used in Vegetable Soups, Souffles, and 
many other dishes, and should be thoroughly 
mastered. 

iMELTED BUTTER 

Put butter in a small sauceboat, stand it on the

btove till it dissolves, and skim. vServe with vege- 
tables, fish or meat. A teaspoon of Anchovy 
Essence may be added. 

M.MTRIv D'HOTEL RinTRR

stir in a short ounce of sifted flour. When this is 
smooth, return to the fire and fry the butter and 
Hour together for a minute, without colouring Add 
the milk, a little at a time, stir continuously, and 
keep smooth. Boil the Sauce for about six minutes 
to cook the flour, season with pepper and salt. 
ihis IS the foundation of many Sauces. Flour 
must always be sifted. All milk, or all white 
stock (meat, fowl or fish), or half milk and half 
stock may be used. A spoonful of cream stirred 
in at the last moment is a great improvement.

I^y till brown, but not burnt. Dissolve half a tea- 
spoon of glaze or Lemco in the gravy (or stock), add 
it gradually to the butter and flour, stirring a.l the 
time, and keeping smooth. The Sauce must boil 
some minutes to cook the flour. Season with 
pepper and salt. Half a teaspoon each of Worces-

.stirred in. Or a tablespoon of port wine. Or a 
teaspoon of red or black currant or blackberry jelly.

MINT SAUCE 

Wash and dry fresh Mint, chop it finely; put in 
a small tureen with white sugar, pour over sufficient 
vinegar, and let it stand for some hours. Stir well. 

APPLE SAUCE 

Peel, core, and cut up the Apples, put them in 
a pan with brown sugar to taste, and a little water.

the rest of the oil. A dessert spoon of boiling 
water may be added carefully, and makes the Sauce 
rather thinner. 

TARTARE SAUCE 

This is Mayonnaise Sauce with Capers or 
C.licrkins, finely chopped, stirred into it.

a teaspoon each of Alushroom Ketchup, Anchovy 
Sauce and Pepper Sauce, a pinch of sugar, salt, 
black pepper, and about a gill of brown gravy. 
Make very hot. The Sauce may be varied by using 
red wine and red currant jelly instead of gravy. 
Or by adding chopped Capers, Chillies, made mus- 
tard, or pickles. 

GLAZE 

C.laze cannot be made economically in a smnll 
establishment. It is best bought in a small gla^s 
jar. Stand the jar in hot water or on the lid of a 
saucepan till the glaze is sufficiently dissolved. Put 
it on Meat and Birds with a brush, which should 
be afterwards rinsed in stock to avoid waste. Or 
add the glaze to Gravies and Soups with a spoon. 
Glaze should be quite cold before putting away. If 
a little mould appears on the top of the jar, wipe it 
off with soft paper, it will not affect the rest. 

GRAVY 

All Gravies should be good, of some food value.

When .stock is poor, or a luxir colour, add Lemco, 
glaze or Marmitc. A littk Worcester, Ketchup, 
Anchovy, or Tomato Sauce may be added (not 
enough of any one to taste). Or a teaspoon of port 
or sherry. Or a teaspoon of red currant or any 
fruit jelly, according to the dish with which the 
Gravy is served. Small joints make little gravy. 
Food already cfx:)ked makes no gravy. That added

waters, put it in the dish with the white sugar, a 
pinch of salt. Pour in the milk, and grate a little 
nutmeg on the top. Bake in a moderate oven for 
thirty or forty minutes. Milk puddings are creamy 
if cooked slowly. They are best made without 
eggs. All puddings should stand for some minutes 
to set after taking out of the oven. Over cooking, 
or cooking too quickly must be avoided. 

This milk pudding may be taken as a standard, 
and the same proportions and method used in the 
making of others. 

Tapioca should be crushed with a rolling pin. 

Sago may be large or small. 

Maccaroni if large or stale mu.st be soaked. 

Vermickt.li and Spaohetti make good puddings.

unless cooked with method. It is a good plan to 
measure out the batter for each into a small cup • 
about 2 tablespoons, or more. Immediately a pan- 
cake^is turned out of the pan, a small piece of lard 
shou.d be put in to get hot, the next batter poured

CREAMS 

CREAM must he kept in a cool place. 
Creams made without gelatine arc very 
simple, and excellent eatiiig. Fruit Creams 
and Fools are much the same thing. Where 
the greater quantity is cream, it is so called. 
Where the fruit predominates, it is a F'ool. Any 
quantity, however small, of cream and fruit can 
be made into a Cream or Fool. vS" r, flavouring 
and colouring, are added to taste. 

Decorations of Creams. The following are used. 
Glace cherries, Angelica, violets, rose leaves, lilac, 
pistache nuts, grated lemon and orange rind, pink 
sugar, &c. 

Cream to Whip. The object of whipping is to 
make cream light by dividing it, putting in air, 
greatly increasing its bulk. If overwhipped, cream 
becomes thick and granulated, approaching butter. 
The folding in of fruit, ike, must be done carefully 
and lightly with a wide sweep of the spoon to avoid 
flattening the whipped cream. 

RASPBERRY CREAM 



Flaspberries, i lb. 
Red Currants, 2 oz.

plate.i. 

vStra\vberkii;s, Blackrkrriks, L»jga\bkrriks, 
and other soft fruits arc made into creams in the 
same way. 

Apricots (tinned) require a squeeze of lemon 
juice, a teaspoon of brandy, and a few drops of 
Carmine to colour. 

Jam, melted, rubbed through a sieve, a squeeze 
of lemon juice added, can be used in creams, instead 
of fruit. 

.SPONGE CREAMS 

^ Crumble some stale sponge cakes and soak in 
Cherry Liqueur ; fold these into whipped cream ; 
sweeten, add a few divided glace cherries. Put the 
cream in small glass cups, decorate with cherries 
and small pieces of Angelica. 

BROWN BREAD CREAMS 

Rub stale bread through a sieve, soak the crumbs 
in Maraschino or a little brandy and flavouring 
essence. Add sugar, fold the crumbs into some 
whipped cream. Put into glass cups and decorate 
with crystallized violets.

water till dissolved. Whisk the whites of one or 
two eggs, add the liquid jelly carefully; flavour, 
sweeten, and colour to taste, and continue whisk- 
ing. When the sponge starts setting pour at once 
into small moulds. A small quantity of whipped 
cream may be folded in with the white of egg and 
jelly. 

FRUIT .STEWED 

All fruit that is ripe and sound is best eaten raw.

SWEET DISHES 



n 



Fruit to be stewed should be cooked in a syrup ; 
keeping it whole when possible, preserving the 
flavour and colour, and avoiding over cooking. In 
winter stewed fruits may be served warm. 

A Syrup. Put J'2 lb. of loaf sugar, and ^ pint 
water in a stewpan and boil for a few minutes, 
taking off any scum. This is the quantity required 
for stewing about 2 lbs. of fruit. 

STEWED APPLEvS 

Make a syrup (see above) flavoured v/ith thin 
lemon rind. Peel the apples, if small core and cook 
them whole ; if large cut into quarters and take out 
the core. Put the apples in the hot syrup, keeping 
them whole, and simmer very gently till a skewer 
will just go through. Lift out the apples with a 
wire spoon and arrai.ge neatly on a glass dish. Boil 
up and reduce the sjTup, colour rather deeply with 
Carmine ; let it cool, and pour over the apples. 

STEWED PEARS 

Are flavoured witli cloves, stick cinnamon, or 
lemon rind, and cooked as Stewed Apples. 

STEWED RHUBARB 

Rhubarb Oranges 

A Syrup 

The sticks of rhubarb should be all of the same 
thickness. Wipe with a cloth, take the skin off 
only if the rhubarb is coarse. Cut into pieces two 
inches long. Make a syrup, flavoured with orange 
rind (see Syrup). Simmer the rhubarb slowly in

STEWED BLACK CURRANTS 

JMake a Syrup (see Syrup). String the currants 
with a silver fork, put them in the syrup, and 
simmer gently for a short time according to ripe- 
ness. Put in a glass dish and serve with plenty of 
cream. 

COLD FRUIT PUDDING 

Line a pudding basin with slices of bread without 
crust. I'ill up with the hot Stewed Currants, 
putting in the fruit with a spoon and adding as 
much syrup as the basin will hold. Cover with 
bread, stand a saucer and weights on the top, and 
leave the pudding till ne.xt day. Turn it out and 
serve with cream. Ripe Blackberries or Rasp- 
berries and Currants may be warmed in a little 
syrup till the juice begins to run, and made into a 
pudding as above. 

FRUIT SAL VDS 

Fruit Salads are arranged according to the fruits 
available. When fruits are juicy they will make a 
syrup with added sugar, when allowed to stand for 
some time. Otherwise a syrup must be made, and 
allowed to boil for some minutes (see Stewed Fruit). 
Half the quantity (a gill of water and 4 oz. of 
sugar) will probably be enough for a salad. A 

144

small tin of any fruit makes a good foundation for 
a salad. The syrup is improved by boiling up with 
more sugar and reducing. It may be flavoured 
with any liqueur, and coloured with Carmine if 
liked. 

RA.SrBERRY SALAD 

Raspberries, i lb. White Sugar 

Red Currants, y^ lb. 

Raspberries should not be picked till ripe, and 
are best uncooked. Pick the raspberries, string 
the currants with a silver fork. Put the fruit in a 
bowl, shaking white sugar between each layer. 
Cover and stand in a cool place for several hours. 
Stir when serving. Hand sponge fingers. 

BLACKBERRY SALAD 

Blackberries should not be picked till ripe and 
juicy, and are best uncooked. Pick ripe black- 
berries into a bowl, looking them over very care- 
fully. Shake in white sugar generously between 
each layer of fruit. Add a teaspoon of brandy if 
liked. Cover and stand in a cool place for several 
hours.

PASTRY, PIES, AND PUDDINGS 



., Jl i 



ONLY light hands can make good pastry. 
It is not a necessary article of food, and 
unless time and care can be given it, is 
best left alone. In towns it is readily bought 
made by expert pastry makers. Vol-au-vents, 
and Patty Cases ready to be filled are made to 
order. 

Flour. Fine white flour makes the lightest 
pastry, but household flour can be used, except for 
puff pastry. A self-raising flour is one that has 
the raising, or baking powder already mixed in it. 
Paisley flour is excellent for raising pastry; it is 
used in the proportion of one ounce to eight ounces 
of flour. With most baking powders one teaspoon 
is required to each half pound of flour. Witb light 
hands this quantity c?" be lessened. All flours 
with their raising should be carefully sifted and 
.'crated. 

Butter used for pastry must be fresh, not what is 
known as cooking butter, which contains much salt 
and water, and is often strong in taste. Butter and 
lard may be used in equal proportions. Dripping 
makes good rough pastry, but should be creamed 
with a knife on a plate, making it lighter in texture 
and colour, and removing any strong flavour. Vege-

table butters or fats are excellent for pastry, pro- 
vided they are not too hard. All fats used for 
pastry making should be of the same consistency as 
the pastry when mixed. Fat is rubbed into the 
flour with the tips of the fingers. By first beating 
it to a cream (if at all hard), a great deal of the 
rubbing is saved. 

All pastry is mixed with water as cold as pos- 
sible. The quantity of water required for mixing 
cannot be given, depending on the quality of the 
flour. The finer flours take up more moisture than 
the coarser ones. Short crust is mixed as dry as 
possible, or it will not eat short. Other pastries 
should be mixed to an elastic dough. 

Pastry, to Roll. Flour the board and pin lightly. 
Make short sharp rolls, lifting the pir constantly, 
and never going over the edges of the pastry. Keep 
it tidy and of even thickness. Pastry should be 
handled as little as possible. The first rolled pastry 
is always the best. Pastry may be kept (uncooked) 
in a cool place for several days. 

Pastry, to Bake. It should be put into a hot oven, 
so that it may rise quickly. The oven door to be 
opened only when necessary, and must not be 
banged. If the pastry is browning too much, the 
top iron sheet should be removed. When the 
pastry of a pie is done and the m r fruit not 

ready, cooking may be continued tue top of the 
stove, standing the dish (on an asbt cos mat), over 
gentle heat. 

Puff Pastry should only be attempted by hands 
that turn out good Short and Flaky Pastry.

the flour with the tips of the fingers. When fine 
pour a little water in the centre, use a knife for

Put in another quarter of fat, sprinkle with flour, 
fold, and turn round and over. Roll out again, 
and put in the last fat; sprinkle with flour, fold in 
three, turn the pastry round and over, and it is 
ready for use. In rolling pastry the neat side is 
always kept towards one, the edges top and bottom. 
An even thickness should be kept. A larger 
quantity of butter can be used if a richer pastry is 
required. Flaky pastries rises in flakes, or layers, 
air being folded in at each turn. The air, as it gets 
heated, raises the pastry.

strip. Soften the butter with a knife, till of the 
same consistency as the pastry, and make it into a 
square, an inch narrower than the strip. Place the 
butter in the centre of the pastry, cover it evenly 
u ith both ends of the strip ; press the edges with the 
rolling pin to keep in the butter, turn the pastry 
over and round. Give it three or four sharp beats 
with the rolling pin ; sprinkle with flour, and set it 
in a cool place for 15 minutes. Again roll the 
pastry in a long strip, using a little flour as re- 
quired; fold it in three, turn over and round, and 
roll it again, making two rolls. Set aside for 15 
minutes and again roll twice, making four rolls. 
Set aside for 15 minutes and again roll twice, mak- 
ing six rolls. Set aside for 15 minutes and roll 
again. This, the seventh roll, is the last, and the 
pastry is ready for pies, vol-au-vents, patties, &c. 
More butter can be used if a richer pastry is re- 
quired, but it is then more difficult tc handle. It is 
a good plan to make Puff Pastry the day before it is 
required. PufT Pastry rises or puffs considerably, 
air being put in with each fold. The air rises when 
heated, and puffs the pastry.

SUET PASTRY 

Suet pastry is used for meat, fruit, plain and 
other puddings, and dumplings. It is steamed or 
boiled, care being taken that water never touches 
the pastry during the process of cooking. For 
raising. Paisley flour (i oz. to 8 oz. flour) or baking 
powder (i t:aspoon to 8 oz. flour), can be used. 
The flour f.nd raising must always be sifted to- 
gether. The fat may be beef suet, nut suet, or 
dripping. Suets are rubbed on a grater, then 
finely chopped (using flour to clean the knife and 
prevent sticking), and rubbed into the flour with 
the tips of the fingers, to insure that there are no 
pieces of fat large enough to be seen left in a 
pudding. Dripping is beaten to a cream (on a 
plate with a knife), an 1 rubbed lightly into the 
flour with the fingers. Cold water is used for 
mixing to a firm paste. Suet puddings should be 
cooked in greased cake tins, or enamel or china 
basins, and covered with greased pap'^r. Pudding 
cloths are neither desirable nor necessary. Suet 
puddings are best cooked in a steamer over fast 

boiling water.

TARTLETS 

Roll out any pastry. With a fluted cutter, cut 
rounds rather larger than the patty tins. These 
should be of a small size. Fit the pastry in the 
tins, pressing round the bottom. Prick with a 
fork, or press in a piece of crust to prevent rising. 
Bake quickly. Fill the tartlets with jam, lemon 
curd, a half apricot with a blanched almond in it, or 
stewed cherries, as in fruit tart. The tartlets may 
be covered with meringue, coconut meringue, or 
whipped cream. 

CREAIM HORNS 

Roll out puff or flaky pastry. Cut strips about 
an inch wide; start at the point of the cornet tin. 
and wind the pastry round, each piece overlapping 
the preceding one. Be careful not to stretch the 
pastry. Lay on a tin, glaze and sprinkle with 
white sugar. Bake quickly ; slip out the tins, and 
cool on a wire tray. Fill with jam and whipped 
cream. Sprinkle with chopped pistache nuts. Rub 
the tins with paper while hot, they are never 
washed. 

TURNOVERS 

Any nieces of pastry can be used for Turnovers. 
Roll out, cut squares, wet the edges, and put a 
spoonful of thick jam in the centre. Fold the 
pastry over, corner to cross corner, and mark the 
edges with the back of a knife. Or cut the pastry 
in rounds, wet the edges, put in the jam, fold over, 
and frill the edges. Put the Turnover on a flat tin,

Q 


jt . ,' 





NEW bread is liked by most people and 
should certainly be served whenever poss- 
ible. If well made, well baked, and well 
masticated, it is easily digested. In small house- 
holds, small loaves make least waste. vStandard, 
wholemeal, and household flours are the most 
nutritious. Bread is raised with German or 
brewer's yeast. Baking powder is a substitute 
for yeast. Paisley flour is excellent for raising. 
Self-raising flours iiave the raising already mixed 
in, and require no other. 

Yeast. German yeast when fresh is soft and 
moist. The amount required is less in proportion 
for a large than for a small quantity of flour. 
7 lbs. flour require i]4 oz. yeast. 
y/i lbs. flour require i oz. yeast. 
I lb. flour requires }4 oz. yjast. 
Wholemeal and brown flours require rather more 
yeast, and take longer to rise than white flours. 

In making bread, the basin, flour, water and 
cloth must all be warm, and kept warm, not hot. If 
the dou'ji is allowed to get cold, or is overheated, 
the bread will be unsatisfactory. 

The amount of water or milk required for mixing 
cannot be accurately given, as flours vary. The 
dough when mixed should be elastic; not too dry, 

164 



=^' 



BREAD 

nor too slack. The water or milk .should be warmed 
to blood heat. 

Light and springy hands are necessary for 
kneading. 

A time for raising cannot be given, as it depends 
on the temperature. The dough should double in 
size in a gentle heat, and is then ready to make up. 

Times for baking depend on the size of the loaves 
or rolls, and the heat of tlie oven. To test, run a 
fine skewer in the thickest part of the loaf; it will 
come out clean and the crust when tapped will 
sound hollow when the bread is ready. All bread 
and rolls should cool on a wire tray or sieve, in 
order to let the steam escape.

stand it in a warm place till the yeast begins to 
work. When the flour cracks, pour in the warm 
water, and mix from the centre with a wooden 
spoon; adding a little more water as required. 
When the flour is all mixed, and the basin clean, 
knead the dough well, raising it from the sides with 
the fists and pressing it into the centre. Use flour

only to prevent sticking. When the dough is light, 
smooth and clastic, flour it lightly; turn it over, 
cover with a cloth and put it in a warm place to 
stand till the dough has doubled in size. Divide 
into loaves and make up quickly on a floured board. 
Put the bread on lightly greased earthenware bak- 
ing dishes, or tins, and stand in a warm place to 
prove (to rise again) for about ten minutes. Bake 
in a hot oven ; the heat can be reduced once the 
bread is set. 

When the bread is ready the crust will sound 
hollow when tapped, and a skewer run into the loaf 
will come out clean. 

The loaves should be placed on a wire stand or 
sieve, to let out the steam. 

Dough will rise well on the plate rack of a gas 
stove, over a lighted gas ring turned to its lowest 
point. 

The flour used for bread may be half wholemeal, 
and half household. Milk whole, skimmed or 
separated may be used instead of water for mixing, 
making a moister bread. 

Loaves may be cottage, brunswick, brick, tin, 
twists, knots, &c. A piece of the bread dough 
should always be made into small rolls of any of 
these shapes. When baking rolls, brush over with 
a little egg, or milk, to glaze.

CAKES 

HOUSEHOLD flour makes good Cakes. 
If a finer flour is wanted, part cornflour, 
potato flour, or ground rice can be ustd 
In making Cakes the flour must always be dry, 
and warm; the baking powder, Paisley flour, or 
other raising, must be mixed in with the flour, 
and all well sifted together. 

The butter used should always be fresh. Vege- 
table butters or lard make good Cakes. Also 
dripping, which should be creamed on a plate before 
using. 

Eggs must alwaj-s be fresh. A little milk may 
often take the place of an egg. 

To clean currants, sultanas, and ra'sins, rub the 
fruit in flour, place it on a wire sieve, shake off 
the loose flour, and pick out all the stalks carefully. 
Cut open the raisins, remove the stones, keeping a 
small basin of warm water near for the fingers. 

Candied peel if hard should be soaked in boiling 
water and dried, before cutting up. 

Tc grease cake tins, keep lard in a small tin or 
jar, stand it on the stove to melt before using. 
Keep a brush for brushing the lard over cake tins 
and lining paper. 

To line a cake tin, take good kitchen paper, turn 
the tin over, cut a round rather larger than the 

170 



CAKES 

bottom of the tin. Cut a strip of paper for the 
sides, higher than the tin, to hold the mixture 
should it rise above. Brush over both tin and 
paper with lard, put in the bottom paper first and 
fit it well. 

To bake Cakes, the oven must be hot enough to 
make the mixture rise. Small Cakes are baked 
sharply. With large Cakes the heat should be 
slightly reduced when the Cake has risen and set. 
In baking a large Cake it is generally a good plan 
to place the tin on an open (barred) sheet, and to 
remove the top iron sheet. If a Cake is browning 
too much it may be covered with a paper. If 
catching at the bottom an asbestos mat may be 
slipped under the tin. 

The oven door should be opened as little as pos- 
sible, and shut gently. 

It is impossible to give accurate times for baking, 
which vary with the size of the tin and Cake, the heat 
of the oven, and other conditions. A Cake which is 
thick and high will take longer to bake than one 
of the same weight placed in a large shallow vin. 
A Cake when ready feels firm in the centre of the 
top. Try the thickest part of it with a skewer; if 
it comes out clean with no dough sticking to it, the 
cake is ready. A Cake mixed with treacle requires 
careful baking, as it catches easily. Sponge Cakes 
require a very even heat, and are easiest baked in 
saucer or small tins. 

To turn out Cakes. All Cakes are turned out on 
a wire Iray or sieve to allow of the escape of steam. 
Large Cakes are less likely to break if allowed to 

171 



, I

THE ONE MAID BOOK OF COOKERY 





Hn 



stand for a couple of minutes after taking out 
of the oven. Turn the tin on one side, slide the 
Cake out carefully, and remove the paper. Tins 
in which Cakes are baked should be rubbed out 
with soft paper while hot, and allowed to get cold 
before putting away. They should never be 
washed. 

Cakes are kept in airtight tins. 

METHODS IN THE MAKING OF CAKES 

The principal mixtures in cake making are the 
Rubbed, the Beaten, and the Sponge. When these 
three methods are mastered. Cakes can be varied 
indefinitely, in flavour, shape, and colour. With 
the rubbed mixture (as Fruit Cake), the butter is 
rubbed into the flour with the tips of the fingers. 
All dry ingredients are prepared and added, and 
eggs, milk, and treacle are used tn mix to a stiff 
dough. With the beaten mixture (as Madeira 
Cake), the butter and sugar are creamed together, 
the yolks of eggs are beaten in, the flour warmed 
and sifted; and the whites of eggs, beaten stiff, are 
folded in gradually, keeping the mixture light. 
With the sponge mixture (as Sponge Cake), the 
eggs and sugar are beaten together till very thick 
and creamy, th'j flour, warmed and sifted, is folded 
in very carefully, keeping the mixture very light. 
Most Cakes are variations of one of these mixtures. 
When making large Cakes of any kind it is a good 
plan to take out some of the mixture and make 
small Buns or Cakes to be eaten first. 

A spatula (or palette knife), is invaluable for 

172 



CAKES 



f I 



cleaning out basins; also for beating whites of eggs 
on a plate. 

Sour milk can always be used in the mixing of 
Cakes, and makes them lighter and more spongy 
than sweet milk. 

To fold in eggs, etc. In mixing a Cake as much 
air is put in as possible, to make it ligh; ; for this 
reason eggs are beaten. If these are stirred into 
the mixture . .e eggs go down again. To fold in 
is to put m with a wide sweep of the spoon, so as 
to add to, and not flatten out the air. 

To weigh treacle. vSift a little flour lightly on to 
the scale, pour in the treacle carefully, stopping it 
with a knife. Lift the scale tin, and turn quickly 
right over, letting the treacle fall into the Cake 
mixture. The tin will b^ qv.ite dry and clean.

once, in one or two tins. Or take out a portion 
and make into small Buns. Syrup, or treacle, 
make the Cake richer and darker in colour, and

Treacle is more easily mixed if first warmed,

A Sponge Cake is best baked in a deep thick saucer 
tin with plain or fluted edges, or in small plain or 
fancy tins, which must be well greased. Careful 
baking is necessary. The top iron sheet should be 
taken out of the oven ; the door opened as little as 
possible, and sliut quietly. All Cakes must be 
turned on a wire tray or sieve to cool. This is a 
standard mixture, flavouring, colour and shape may 
be altered to taste. The following Cakes are made 
with the same mixture.

Cool on a wire tray or sieve. 

TO ICK CAKKS 
The best icing sugar should be used. Pound it 
with a pestle in a mortar, and sift through a hair 
sieve. A spatula or flat knife with a flexible blade 
is the best for spreading Royal Icing, dipping it in 
water constantly. Ornamental icing is done with a 
forcing bag, screw and pipe, and can be flavoured 
and coloured to taste. Cakes may be decorated 
with glace fruits, especially Cherries, Angelica, 
crystalised Violets, Rose leaves, Lilac, Pista.he 
nuts (blanched and chopped), Almonds (blanched 
and browned). Walnuts. These are arranged on 
the icing before it sets. 

ROYAL ICING 

White of 1 Egs Lemon Juice 

Icinpj Sugar, '^ lb. 

Beat the white of egg in a basin till stiff; fold the 
sifted sugar in gradually with a spoon, keeping it 
very light, and adding a few drops of lemon juice. 
The exact quantity of sugar cannot be given, de- 
pending on the size of the egg, but the above is an 
average. Lemon juice keeps the icing a good white. 
When the icing is of the right consistency, place 
some in the centre of the Cake, and spread it over 
with the wet palette knife. Let this set in a warm 
place. Decorate later with fancy icing or fruits. 

Icing left over should be covered with wet tissue

THE LARDER AND SCRAPS 

A GOOD housekeeper will aim at having 
fresh food daily, and will so order meals 
that there will be little left from day 
to day. A regular inspection of the larder will 
be found of great help in drawing up the day's 
menus. The planning and arranging for the 
using up of scraps is a real satisfaction. Nothing 
that has a food value should be thrown away. 
No scraps are too small to be of use, but they 
should be eaten while fresh and sweet. 

Egg. A boiled egg left over can be warmed up 
without hardening; or it may be hard boiled and 
made into a savoury ; or put into sauce, or used as 
a garnish for salad, etc. 

A broken egg, or part of one. Cover this with 
wet tissue paper to prevent drying, and it may be 
kept a day. It can be put into soup, sauce, or used 
for brushing over. 

Several recipes are given for using up cold meat, 
game, fish and vegetables. Scraps of any of these 
may be made into savoury toasts, etc. (see Sav- 
ouries), using judgment as to mixing and seasoning. 
White or brown sauce, even a teaspoonful is of 
value. With a small quantity of fish it suggests 
scollops, fish balls, savouries. A spoonful of cooked 
Spinach will make Spinach Soup or a savoury toast. 

184 



ill 



THE LARDER AND SCRAPS 

Potatoes and other vegetables, if not overcooked 
in the first instance, are delicious fried up, or 
warmed with a little butter (mixed or otherwise). 

The end of a rice or other milk pudding will go 
to the making of small Creams (see Creams). 

Stewed fruit will make a Fool or Cream with the 
addition of a small quantity of cream. 

Stale cake or biscuits suggest a Cabinet Pudding, 
or a sweet dish arranged with custard and jam. 

Stale bread will make white crumbs, golden 
crumbs, toast, crisps, fried bread ; and can be used 
in sweet and savoury puddings. 

COLD MEAT 

Cold meat should be daintily served. A joint 
must be tidied and the dry outside cut off before 
sending to table. Any salad stuff can be used for 
a garnish ; or parsley, cold vegetables, or pickles. 
When a joint looks mean the meat should be neatly 
cut off and arranged on a dish. A sharp knife is 
necessary for good carving. 

Any cold meat will make a Meat Salad. 

Cold chicken will make a Chicken Salad^ or 
Mayonnaise. 

Made Dishes. Meat, poultry, fish, vegetables 
already cooked must not be recooked. They may 
be warmed, requiring a good gravy, sauce, milk or 
butter, in order to keep up a food value. Cooked 
meat will not make a gravy. These are important 
facts and should be remembered. Meat cut up by 
hand has more flavour than when put through a 
mincing machine, and is easier to digest. All skin

meat dishes. 

MEAT SAI<AD (see Salads) 

CHICKEN SAT.AD (see Salads) 
RUSSIAN FIIXETS 
Cut rounds of cold juicy beef, about V2 inch 
thick. Brush these over with glaze, and arrange 
down the centre of a dish, with a Russian Salad of 
any cooked vegetables round (see Russian Salad). 
Rounds of veal or mutton may be served in the 
same way. 

RUSSIAN CUTLETS 
Take cold neck of lamb or mutton; divide and 
trim the cutlets, a bone to each. Brush over with 
glaze, wrap silver paper round the end of each 
bone, and arrange down the centre of a dish with 
a cold vegetable salad round. (See Russian Salad.) 

GRILLED BONES 

Take a shoulder of mutton, or other bone, with 
some meat left on it. Score it with a sharp knife, 
brush over with salad oil, or melted butter. Grill 
sharply, season highly; place on a hot dish with 
a little piece of butter, and serve at once. 

Chicken or turkey legs may be grilled or devilled. 

DEVILLED BONES

Sauce (see Sauces). Or the grilled bones may be 
simmered for 15 minutes in the sauce. 

POTATO PIE 

Cut up cold meat in dice, put in a pie, or fireproof 
or souffle dish, season well. Pour over a good and 
well-flavoured gravy. A small quantity of cold 
peas, P'rench beans or carrots may be added if con- 
venient Cover the dish with mashed potato, rake 
the top with a fork, and dot with small pieces of 
dripping. Or cut cold potatoes in slices, cover the 
dish, and put pieces of dripping on top. Stand the 
dish at the back of the stove for about an hour to 
soak and slightly warm; or on a mat over very 
little gas. Brown the potatoes sharply under the 
grill, before the fire, or in a very hot oven. 

STUFFED MARROW 

Cut fine any scraps of meat or bird, ham or 
tongue, and season well. Peel a green marrow, cut 
it in halves lengthwi.se, take out the seeds; fill it 
with the mince and tie up with a broad tape. 
Cook in a steamer; or in a small quantity of stock 
in a stewpan; or in the oven. Dish the marrow as 
soon as a skewer will go in. If overcooked it will 
be soft and watery. Drain for a couple of minutes, 
dish, take off the tape, and cover the marrow with 
a good White Sauce. Or brush the marrow over 
with glaze and pour a little gravy round. 

MUTTON HASH

and gristle, and put between two plates on the rack 
to warm. Cut some onions (according to size) in 
rings Heat a little dripping in a small casserole 
and fry the onions brown. Add seasoned flour to 
the onions (one tablespoon flour, one teaspoon salt. 
^ teaspoon pepper), stir with a knife till the flour 
is brown and the fat absorbed (there must not be 
enough fat to make the hash greasy). Add a tea- 
spoon each of Worcester, Ketchup, Tomato and 
Anchovy Sauces, and a small quantity of good 
stock Boil for some minutes to cook the flour. 
Lift the pan off the fire, lay in the meat, and cover 
it Stand the pan for an hour or less at the back 
of the stove ; or on an asbestos mat v/ith very little 
gas under. A teaspoon of red or black currant, 
or blackberry jelly, or port wine, greatly improves 
the gravy, which should be a dark brown m colour. 
The stock can be made from the bones of the joint, 
adding some Lemco or other extract, or glaze. The 
hash may be served in the casserole; or the slices 
neatly arranged on a dish and the gravy poured 
round. Baked tomatoes as a vegetable. 

BEEF MINCE 

Cut beef, or other meat, in dice, remove all skin 
and gristle. Cook as Mutton Hash (see recipe), 
but mince the onions. If the quantity of meat is 
scanty, fry triangles of bread and serve round the 
dish " Or fry squares or rounds of bread, about Yi 
inch'thick. and put the mince on. A mince should 
have very little loose gravy ; if there should be to'j 
much let the pan stand on the stove without a lid.

THE LARDER AND SCRAPS 

DUCHESS CUTLETS 
Divide cutlets from cold neck of lamb or mutton, 
a bone to each. Trim ; with a knife cover with cold 
Ouion or other White Sauce ; egg, breadcrumb, and 
fry in deep fat to a golden brown. Dish the cut- 
lets, wrap silver paper round the end of each bone, 
and put peas or French beans round. 

RISSOIvES 

Take cold beef or mutton, cut up fine, season 
well, and put in a basin. Make a Panada (see 
Sauces) and stir to the meat. Let this get cold. 
Divide the mixture into halves, and quarters, and 
take an equal number of pieces out of each, so the 
Rissoles are of even size. Make into balls, using 
a little flour on the outside only. Brush over with 
egg, and roll in white crumbs. Fry a few at a 
time in smoking fat, sufficiently d-ep to cover the 
Rissoles. Drain on soft paper. Serve the Rissoles 
piled up on a dish paper, and garnish with fresh or 
fried parsley. They should be golden brown. 

Durham Cutlets. — Make a Rissole mix- 
ture, adding a small quantity of French beans, 
carrots, or other cooked vegetables. Put this to 
cool on a large plate. To shape the cutlets, cut 
across in halves and quarters, and again into as 
many pieces as cutlets required ; they will need very 
little shaping. This is done on a floured board, 
using a knife. Egg, breadcrumb, and fry as Ris- 
soles. Dish the cutlets leaning on each other down 
the centre of the dish. Garnish with peas or 

parsley.

Croquettes.— Take cold veal and ham, rab- 
bit and pork, chicken and bacon, or game. The 
mixture is made as Rissoles, using milk or white 
stock in the Panada. Roll the balls out on a floured 
board, altering the shape to small rolls. Arrange 
the Croquettes down the centre of the dish. Gar- 
nish with French beans. 

French Croquettes.— Roll out some pastry 
very thin, cut squares or rounds, and wet the 
edges. Put in the centre of each small pieces of 
Rissole or Croquette mixture. Fold over and 
press the edges together; brush with egg, roll in 
crushed vermicelli, and fry as Rissoles. 

Potato Rissoi.es.— Take mashed potato, roll it 
out lightly on a floured board. Cut rounds, put in 
the centre of each a small quantity of finely minced 
and well seasoned meat. Work the potato over, 
making into the shape of an egg; rub in flour, 
brush over with egg, breadcrumb, and fry in deep 
fat. Garnish with parsley.

Cold Meat Stock and vSauces 

Onion Curry Powder, Flour 

Dripping Coconut, Raisins 

Cut any cooked meat in dice. Heat a small piece 
of dripping in a casserole, cut an onion in slices and 
fry. When it is brown, add a dessert spoon of 
curry lewder and a dessert spoon of flour mixed 
together (according to taste and the quantity of

meat). Stir till the flour is brown and smooth, and 
all the fat is absorbed (there must not be much fat, 
or the Curry will be greasy). Add a teaspoon each 
of Worcester, Mushroom, Tomato, and Anchovy 
Sauces, and about Vi pint of brown stock or gravy. 
Let this boil for five minutes to cook the floui and 
curry powder. Lift the pan ofE the lire, and stir in 
the cold meat. Place the pan at the back of the 
stove (or on an asbestos mat over very little gas) 
for about an hour, stirring occasionally. Add a 
few stoned raisins, or sultanas, about an ounce of 
grated coconut, and at the last moment a few drops 
of lemon juice. A Curry should have no loose 
gravy ; if there should be too much, let the casserole 
stand uncovered on the stove. 

Any cooked vegetables (potato excepted) may be 
put in a Curry, or a green apple, or some chutnec, 
A Curry may be made of any meat (mixed) or fish. 
Or vegetables, sausages, hard boiled eggs, etc. 
Curry is eaten with ? dessert spoon and fork. Rice 
is always served with it.

BOILED RICE 

Wash 4 oz. or more of Patna rice. Put it in a 
saucepan of fast boiling salted water. Cook un- 
covered, stirring it occasionally. When the rice is 
just soft (try it when it has boiled ten minutes), 
turn it on to a hair sieve. Rinse the pan out with 
hot water and pour over the rice. Stand the sieve 
for about half an hour on the plate rack (or other 
warm place), separating the grains with a fork every 
now and then. Rices vary so much that time for

separate when cooked, and should offer enough re- 
sistance to require mastication. Rice if overcooked 
will not dry properly. The boiling of rice is sim- 
plified by using a special tin to hold it. A Curry 
and Boiled Rice should be served in two separate 
dishes of equal size. The colour of a Curry should 
be brown. 

ME.AT FRITTERS 

Make a good frying batter (see Frying Batter, or 
Pancake Batter). Cut meat, chicken or game, in 
neat pieces; season, dip in the batter, covering well, 
and fry in boiling fat. Pieces of cold cauliflower, 
or other vegetables, may be used up in the same 

dish. 

FISH SALAD 

Any cold fish, freed from skin and bone, will 
make a salad (see Salads). 

Cold salmon may have vinegar poured over it, 
and be served with or without a salad. 

FISH BALLS 

Take cold fish off the bones, remove the skin, 
and flake it with two forks. Mix the fish with cold 
White Sauce, adding a little Anchovy essence, and 
seasoning. Divide the mixture into equal sized 
portions; flour the hand and board lightly, and 
make into balls. Rub over flour, brush with beaten 
egg, roll in white crumbs and fry in deep fat till a 
golden brown. Drain the balls on soft paper, serve 
on a dish paper, and garnish with parsley.

PoTATOE.s Buttered.— Take cold new or waxy 
potatoes. Put them in a double pan (boiling 
water in the outside one), with a good piece of 
butter; pepper and salt. Stand over the fire till the 
potatoes are hot through. Sometimes add a sprink- 
ling of chopped parsley. Any one vegetable may 
be warmed up this way, or several vegetables mixed. 
A gourmet or stone jar is most useful for warming 
up. 

Fried Potatoes.— Cut cold potatoes in slices. 
Heat a piece of dripping in a fry pan. When 
smoking, put in the potatoes and fry brown on both 
sides. Dish, and sprinkle with salt. 

CoLC.\NNOX.— Fry cold potatoes as above; when

sley. A beaten egg may be added to the mashed 
potato. 

Potato au Gratin. — Melt butter in a small 
fireproof dish, cut cold potatoes in slices, and 
lay in. Make a small quantity of Cheese Sauce (or 
take cold White Sauce, smooth over the fire with a 
little milk and stir in grated cheese). Pour the 
sauce over the potatoes, sprinkle with brown

SWEET DISHES 

Milk Pur>L)ixr,s.— The remains of any milk 
pudding, freed from skin, may be made into small 
Creams (see Creams) or a Rice Meringue. 

Stewed Fruit, however small a quantity, will 
go to the making of a Cream or Fool (see Creams). 

Stale Cake may be spread with jam, covered 
with a custard, a little whipped cream on the top, 
and served as a sweet dish. 

STALE BREAD 

Toast, use yesterday's bread. With a sharp 
knife cut slices of even thickness. The fire must 
be clear or gas grill very hot so as to toast quickly. 
Turn the bread when one side is brown. Cut off 
the crust. Stand the toast in a warm place to allow 
the steam to escape. Toast should be made when 
required, it quickly hardens if made too soon. 

Buttered Toast.- -Make a dish very hot, and 
stand it over hot water, make toast. Soften 
the butter with a knife, and spiead it generously 
on the hot toast. Sprinkle with salt, stand a

TINNED FOOD 



hi 






IM : 






III ': 



A GOOD housekeeper will be prepared for 
emergencies. Tinned foods are most use- 
ful. Provided reasonable care is taken, 
there is little more risk than with fresh food. 
(It is not su digested that tinned food be regu- 
larly used where fresh is to be had.) Tinned 
food should be of the best brand obtainable, and 
this season's goods. It is to be hoped that 
before long each tin will be marked with the 
date of canning. Damaged tins, and those re- 
duced in price, should not be bought. All tins 
should be cooled by soaking in cold water for some 
time before opening. Tins should be opened neatly, 
the lid cut right off, and all the contents turned at 
once into a basin (vSardines excepted). If there is 
even a doubtful smell or appearance the food should 
not be used. 

Sours.—- Many are excellently put up, but they 
generally require more liquid than is given in the 
directions. Consomme is improved with a little 
wine, or with Italian paste. Grated cheese is often 
served witl; it. 

Pish.— Lobster and salmon are now wrapped in 
paper, avoiding contact with the tin. Both make 
good cutlets, fish balls, etc. Oysters make excel-

lent soup or sauce. vSardines, being preserved in 
oil, are kept in the tin. They are eaten cold, or 
made hot and served on toast or fried bread. 

Potted jMhats axo I'lsn, are most useful for 
sandwiches and savouries, but should not be kept 
for more than a k-w d..ys once opened. 

Vkgetablks. — Raked Beans and Sweet Corn are 
excellent, and only require .varraing. 

Fruits in syrup are a real boon. Pineapple, 
whole or in chunks. Peaches, .Vpricots, etc., may be 
had in large or small tins. These fruits are deli- 
cious eaten as they are, but are much improved 
In- boiling up the syrup with a little more sugar. 
When the s\Tup has boiled for a few minutes, 
remove the pan from the fire, put the fruit in the 
syrup carefully, cover, and let it stand till cold. 
A teaspoon of rum or brandy, or any liqueur, im- 
proves the syrup. In winter the fruits may be 
served warm. 

Biscuits.— Plain, Savoury, and Sweet, must be 
kept in separate tins. Biscuits containing butter 
(Shortbreads, etc.) should not be mixed with the 
others. If biscuits lose their crispness, put them 
on a tin in a hot oven for five minutes or more, 
turn on a .vire tra3' or sieve, and put away when 
cold. Many biscuits may now be bought in l4 lb. 
packets, wrapped in greaseproof paper. 

Cakes.— One or two of the richer small cakes 
made by good firms and sold wrapped up in grease- 
proof paper, will keep fresh some time, and are 
useful in an emergency.

DRINKS 

WATER for the table should be drawn 
' Pt the last moment, it so quickly 
becomes stale and flat. Wherever 
possible the tap should run some time before 
filling the jugs, in warm weather especially, then 
the water will be cold. 

WATER. To Bon. 
An 'Octopus- should be kept in every kettle to 
nrevent furring, and must be constantly rinsed 
especiallv where the water is hard, kettles should 
be emptied and turned upside down every night. 
Water boils at a temperature of 212 degrees when 
bubbles freely rise to the surface. For all drinks, 
fresh draun and freshly boiled water is essential. 

TEA 
Tea should be of good quality and kept in an 
airtight tin, not in paper. Stand the teapot to 
warm on the stove with an asbestos mat under it 
Allow about a teaspoon of tea to each person and 
one over (when numbers are large the proportion 
is reduced). Four in the water immediately it boils, 
stand for a minute or two only, giving a light stir 
with a spoon. The teapot should be put away dry.

kept in an airtight tin, not in paper. One ounce of 
coffee is allowed to each Yz pint of water. Two 
ounces coffee, one pint of water and one pint of 
milk make breakfast coffee for two persons, allow- 
ing two large cups each. Black coffee (for after 
dinner) is made stronger and in small quantity. 
Coffee is best made in an earthenware jug. Stand 
the dry jug (with the coffee) to warm on the stove, 
on an asbestos mat. Pour the water on the coffee 
immediately it boils, and stir well. Keep the jug 
standing on the stove for five to ten minutes; take 
off the froth with a spoon, and pour the coffee into 
another hot jug, through muslin if necessary. 

MILK. To Boil 

An earthenware pan or a boiler is the best for 
milk. It should stand on an asbestos mat. Milk 
is spoilt if really boiled, and should be taken off at 
scalding point, directly bubbles begin to rise. 

Milk for drinking should be poured into a glass 
early, and covered. The cream rises to the surface 
and is not wasted. 

If required warm, stand the cov'-ncd glass (or jug) 
in a saucepan of hot water till sufficiently warm. 
vStir well as the milk in the bottom of the jug will 
be hottest. Milk should not be cooked and cooled. 



COCOA 

Cocoa has a high food value. It is an excellent 
cold weather drink or food. A good cocoa should 
be bought. Directions for making are always given 
with each brand. As a rule, the powder and sugar 

N 201 






THE ONE MAID BOOK OF COOKERY 

are mixetl and moistened to a paste, the boiling 
water or milk poured over, and all well stirred or 
whisked. The flavour is improved by putting the 
mixed cocoa in a pan and bringing it just to the 
boil, whisking occasionally. 

LEMON A Die 



SuRar, 2 ozs. (more or 
less) 



Lemons, 2 or 3 
Water, i quart 

Choose ripe and clean lemons. With a sharp 

knife cut off the rind very thin ; it must be yellow 

on both sides, with no scrap of white. Put the rind 

in a jug, add the loaf sugar (according to taste), 

pour over a pint of boiling water, cover closely and 

stand in a warm place for about an hour. Squeeze 

the lemons over a glass squeezer (being very careful 

to let no pip fall in). Add the juice and other pint 

of cold water, and let the lemonade get absolutely 

cold. Less water may be used and the glasses filled 

up with soaa water. 

LKMON .SYRUP kor LEMONADE 

Citric Acid Crystals, 

4 ozs. 
Water, 4 pints 

Boil the water and loaf sugar, take off any scum, 
and pour into a large basin. When cool put in the 
crystals and stir occasionally with a wooden spoon, 
till they are dissolved. When the syrup is quite 
cold (it' is a good plan to leave it all night), stir in 
the essence of lemon, mix well, and pour the syrup 
through muslin and a funnel into bottles. This

quantity makes nearly four large bottles, and will 
keep a long time. 

To use, pour about a tablespoon of the syrup 
(according to tast(;) in a tumbler ; fill up with water, 
or half soda water. 



BARLEY WATKR, Ci.EAR 

Pearl IJaiky, i uz. vSujjar, i oz.

with boiling water in the outside pan. Pour over 
I pint of boiling water, and stir with a wooden 
spoon. Add a good pinch of salt, and keep the 
outside water boiling for half an hour or more, 
stirring the porridge occasionally. Pour into small 
plates or saucers, and let the porridge set for a 
few minutes before putting on the table. Serve 
with milk or cream, sugar or syrup.

FRUIT lor preserving must be sound and 
gathered dry. Hard fruit should be wiped 
over with a dry cloth. The best cane 
.ugar, crystals or loaf, is the most economical 
to use. 'Preserving Sugar' is often not clean. 
\u earthenware pan is excellent for jam male- 
ing, or thick enamel, or a metal pan can be 
used It is a good plan to place an asbestos mat 
under the pan to prevent burning. The spoon for 
stirring must always be of wood. An enamel or 
silver one is used for skimming. 

To Preserve. -The fruit is picked over, put m 
the pan, brought slowly to the boil and boiled for 
about ten minutes. (With hard fruits, such as 
plums, a little water is put in the pan, as it is some 
time before any juice runs out.) The sugar is then 
slipped in gradually at the side of the pan, and all 
boiled quickly t-U the jam is ready. Stirring should 
be constant, and the scum taken off as it rises. It 
is a good plan to warm the sugar on a tin or disli 
before adding to the fruit. To each lb. of fruit a 
lb. or H lb. of sugar is allowed, according to taste 
and the condition of the fruit. 

Times for jam making cannot be given accurately, 
depending on the condition of the fruit and the 
amount of heat used. When the jam looks glazed

aud boils quietly put a little on a plate to cool. If 
this sets or jellies the jam is ready. If not, con- 
tinue boiling and try again. 

To cover the jam, pour milk in a saucer, cut 
rounds of thick tissue paper, dip them in the milk, 
drain on a cloth, lay on the top of the pots or 
glasses and press gently to the sides. If the jam 
is to be packed, use parchment covers and tie round. 
Pots and glasses must be clean and dry, and should 
be filled up to the very top. 

RASPBERRY AND RKD CURRANT JAM 
Raspberries, 6 lbs. Cane Sugar, 8 lbs. 

Currants, 2 lbs. 

Pick the raspberries, string the currants with a 
silver fork; put both in an earthenware pan and 
stand on a gentle heat, with an asbestos mat under- 
neath. Stir till the fruit is hot and the juice begins 
to flow. I.et the pan come slowly to the boil, and 
boil for 10 minutes. SI ,) the warm sugar in at the 
side of the pan, boil up quickly, take off all scum 
and stir all the time. Boil for 20 or 30 minutes, 
or till the jam will jelly. Put a spoonful on a plate, 
let it cool. If the jam sets and hangs on the plate 
it is ready; if not, continue boiling and try again. 
The jam should have a bright colour. 

The quantities of the fruits are altered according 
to taste and convenience. 

Black Cjrrant Jam.— Being a rich fruit a 
gin of water is added to each pound of fruit. Make 
as raspberry jam.

Stkawbkrry Jam. — Strawberries tor jam should 
l)c as small as possible, and gathered when the 
weather is dry. Make as raspberry jam. 

Cherry Jam. — Cherries should be stoned. 
Crack the stones and put in some of the kernels. 
Make as raspberry jam. 

Plum Jam.— Plums are wiped, cut in halves, 
and the stones taken out if the fruit is suffici..itly 
ripe. Otherwise the stones will come to the top 
in cooking and should be taken out. Crack some 
of the stones with a weight, scald the kernels and 
stir into the jam when nearly done. Sometimes 
the plums are skinned ; with some varieties this is 
facilitated by dipping the fruit in scalding water. 

RHUBARB JAM 

Rhubarb, 8 lbs. Sweet Oranges, 4 (or 

Loaf Sugar, 8 lbs. less) 

Wipe the sticks of rhubarb (take off the skin if 
it is coarse), and cut in small equal pieces. Put in 
an earthenware or other pan ; add the juice and very 
finely cut orange rind (none of the white skin). 
Bring gently to the boil, and boil for about 10 
minutes. Slip the warm sugar in at the side of 
the pan and boil quickly till the jam will set. 
Skim carefully. 

TxREliN TOMATO JAM 

Green Tomatoes I^oaf or Crj'stal Sugar 

Lemons 

Take equal quantities of green tomatoes and 
sugar. Take the finely cut rind (no white) and the

juice of a large lemon to each 3 or 4 lbs. ol fruit. 
Wipe the tomatoes, cut in quarters, and remove 
the small hard pieces. Put in a preserving pan 
with the lemon juice and rind. When this has 
boiled for about 10 minutes, slip in the warm sugar 
and boil quickly till the jam will set. Small 
almonds blanched, dried and split, may be stirred 
in when the jam is nearly nady. 

MARROW JAM 

Green Marrow vSiigar 

Lemons 

Choose a dark green and unripe marrow. Peel, 
cut into pieces of about an inch, and weigh. To 
each 3 lbs. of fruit add the juice and very finely cut 
rind of a lemon. To each lb. of fruit add i lb. of 
loaf sugar. Put all in a large basin and let it 
stand all night. Next day take out the fruit, put 
the syrup in a pan and boil hard for about half an 
hour, taking off all scum. Add the marrow and 
boil till the jam looks quite clear. 

APPLE JELLY 

Apples Sugar 

Cloves or Cinnamon Water 

Windfalls do well for making jelly. Wipe the 
fruit, divide in quarters, cut cut the core and any 
bruises, but do not peel. Put the apples in a pre- 
serving pan, just cover with water; add a piece of 
cinnamon, or a few cloves. Simmer slowly till the 
apples are all quite soft. Scald a jelly bag, tie it 
to the backs of two chairs (in a warm place) or to

the rail of the gac cooker and a chair; put a basin 
underneath. Put the apple pulp slowly into the 
bag with a small cup, and let it stand till no more 
juice runs out. Measure the juice. To each pint 
allow I lb. of sugar, and put into a clean bright 
pan. Boil quicklj', carefully taking oflF all scum. 
When the jelly turns red and boils quietly, try a 
little on a plate (see directions). When it jellies, 
take the pan off the fire and put tlie jelly into small 
glass jars, filling up to the top. (See Apple Cheese.) 

APPLE CHEESE 

Take the pulp left in the jelly bag (see Apple 
Jelly) ; rub it lightl> through a wire sieve with a 
wooden spoon, scraping the sieve occasionally to 
remove the skins. Weigh, to each lb. of pulp take 
^ lb. of sugar. Add the grated rind and juice of 
a lemon to every 3 or 4 lbs. Put all in a pan and 
boil quickly, stirring all the time, till a little cooled 
on a plate will set. As the fruit is ready cooked, 
the cheese is quickh' made. Put it in straight pots 
or moulds. The Apple Cheese can be turned out 
when wanted. 

GOOvSEBERRY JELLY 

Cut off the tops and stalks of green gooseberries, 
and wip;. the fruit with a cloth. Make as Apple 
Jelly, but leave out the spice. The jelly will be a 
bright red. (See Gooseberry Cheese.)

cheese will be a bright green when ready, and 
should be put in small moulds or cups. (See Goose- 
berry Jelly.) 

MARMALADE 



Large Seville Oranges 12 
Water, 12 piuts 



Loaf or Crystal vSugar, 
12 lbs. 



Wipe the fruit clean and cut in halves, across 
the core. Rub the oranges on a glass squeezer and 
remove all the pips. Cut the peel (on a clean chop- 
ping board) in thin slices; or cut roughly, as 
preferred. Put the peel in large basins, cover with 
the measured water and soak all night. Take a 
pint of the measured water^ cover all uncut pips 
and let that also stand. Early next morning put 
the peel and water, the juice and strained water 
from the pips in a pan, and simmer very gently 
till the peel is soft; this may take three or four 
hours, according to the quantity and heat. Slip 
in the warmed sugar and boil very quickly, stirring 
all tlie time, and removing all scum. When the 
marmalade looks clear and bright, try a little on a 
plate ; it is ready when it jellies. 

This recipe is, to each orange i pint water and 
I lb. sugar, but the oranges must be large, other- 
wise count 3 oranges as 2.

Always 
add Oxo. 



A spoonful of Oxo in a hash or stew or meat pie adds 
the finishing touch of completeness — invests them with a 
relish and piquancy pleasing to the palate. 

And it has been proved that the addition of Oxo to a 
meal causes the meal to yield more nutriment because of 
Oxo's power to promote absorption. 

Therefore, for flavour and nutriment, always add Oxo. 

Some simple Oxo recipes for One Maid 
Cookery are attached to every bottle of Oxo.

THK ONK MAID HOUSE' 

By Mrs M. A. Cloudesley Brerlton, M.R.San. I. 

The modern tendency is to do with .is few serv-intsas possible, 
first because, owing to the de.irth of domestics, we cannot get 
as many as we would like for the wages which wc can afford 
to p.iy, and secondly because, in towns, house rent is such an 
expensive item in the housekeeping budge^ that the servants' 
bedrooms have to be a great consideration when arrai ging a 
home. The difference between say a seven-roomed and eight- 
roomed house frequently means a difference of five or ten 
pounds a year in rent, rates and taxes. Every servant saved 
means, in fact, either something knocked oft '.he rent or more 
accommodation gained for the family for the same rent. For 
iiistanc:, a visitors' room, or a little private den for the master 
or mistress, is gained by saving even one maid. 

The house where one maid only is kept might be, indeed 
often is, the ideal domestic scheme. Provided such a single- 
handed maid knows her work and docs it well the mistress has 
the minimum of worry if not of work in such a household. 

Now the One-Servant house can be roughly divided into two 

types- 
There is first the type of establishment in which, were it 
not for ultra-modern labour-saving devices, three indoor servants 
'. least would be kept, butler, cook and housemaid. There 
is not space to discuss that interesting problem here. 

The second type of household is that in which the mistress 
would do a great deal of her own work in any case, and (with 
perhaps a family of young children to look after) would have 
only the help of a young, tiresome, and inexperienced general 
servant. There are of course varying conditions in the l-.tter 
domestic scheme, such as the same family employing that almost 
extinct type of maid, the good all-round experienced and 
reliable general servant who can ' wash, cook, sew and wait 
t.ible, and who is very fond of children and nursery work,' as 
the registry offices put it. 

In practice the problems indicated arc entirely different in 
the two cases. In the second type of house — the one now under 
consideration — the object of installing labour-saving appliances 
(such as gas fires, a gas cooker, and g-is water-heater) is different 
from the first. It aims, not at decreasing the number of servants, 
for probably only one would be kept in any case, but rather 



ir, 






i 



n 



aim- ^t saving the huin.m energy of the wife and mother and 
making it possible for her to get more lonfort and pleasure 
out of life than could be po,^^ible if she had lier nose always to 
the domestic grindstone, as a sort of glorified general servant 
to her own husband and children day in and day out all the 
years of her life. It aims also at making the work of the more 
or less indifferent servant orderly, regular and effective, because 
it removes from her day's routine so much of the uncertainty, 
so many of the irritating unexpectednesses of the best-laid plans 
in an oKl-t'ashioned and ill-arranged home. 

Fo • inctarcc, the smutty maid may and will become clean 
for the unexpected calls to the front door, to nursery, dining- 
room, etc. For ifAy was she smutty in the days of coal and 
soot ; was it /ler fault that soot made her black ? 

Again, with gas in the kitchen, the punctuality of breakfast, 
dinner ix supper can be relied on, because the one maid is not 
dependent on the vagaries of a coal range while trying to run 
up and down stairs and answer bells, and make herself generally 
useful. What is equally important, the mistress can help her 
at any moment, even in the smartest and most de! cate of 
dresses, a thing utterly impossible in a coal-worked house. 

In short, with a gas-cooker the responsibility and labour of 
the housekeeping and the housework is reduced to a minimum 
in every direction, above and below stairs, both for the mistress 
and her one maid. Her kitchen is never inv.ided by the coal- 
heaver or the sweep. There is no coal range to make heavy, 
dirty work, and, even when lighted, to gc out perhaps just when 
most neJed if the maid has to leave it for a while to attend 
to something else. Her time before breakfast can be spent 
bustling round the dining-room and hall, instead of struggling 
with the kitchen fire. She can put all her breakfiist crockery, 
and her bacon, eggs, and other things, ready over night ; and 
next morning in a few minutes after clearing her hall and 
dining-room and laying her table, can in a very few minutes 
have, cooked and served, steaming tea and coffee with toast and 
that British breakfast stand-by of 'bacon and eggs, wi> eggs 
and bacon for a change,' as a witty Frenchwoman once expressed 
it. Such a fascinating subject might lead to a very long essay ; 
but it must suffice here to say that with gas for everything, as 
well, of course, as ether modern arrangements properly thought 
out, the anxious mistress of only one maid need not be too 
anxious lest she should be left for a short period without any 
maid at all. 



Madeira Cake (fills a 2 lb. tin.) 

I packet of cakeoma : 4 o/,s. of butter ; 2 eggs ; oae-third to half- 
aglass of milk. 

Method. — Rub the butter well into the cakeoma,

moulds, and bake in a quick oven. 

Lemon Pudding. 

I packet of cakeoma; 6 ozs. suet (chopped fine) ; a pinch of salt 
2 egi;s ; one-third to half a-glass of milk ; the graLed rinds of two and

Do you like^ 
Pastry ? 

Most people do ? But 
they don't often get it 
good, and then it upsets 
them That is because you 
can't mix a little baking 
powder with a lot of flour. 

The right way is to use 
M'Dougairs Self-Raising 
1-lour. It has all the rais- 
ing ingredients already 
mixed in by machinery. 

It makes lovely tarts, pies,

just think of the time it 
saves, the health it saves !
