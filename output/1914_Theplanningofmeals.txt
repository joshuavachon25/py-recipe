THE PLANNING OF MEALS 

"What shall we eat?" "What shall we drink?" 
"Wherewithal shall we be clothed?" These are ever-present 
questions for the housekeeper. Comparatively few people 
recognize the very great importance to the welfare of the 
family and of society that attaches to the answer that is 
made to these questions. Indeed, the housekeeper herself 
often has very little conception of the importance of her 
work from the standpoint of health and efficiency. As one 
has said, billions of money are spent by women for food, 
without any knowledge of the economic principles involved, 
in a way that would not be tolerated in any other business 
enterprise. The business of housekeeping is really "big 
business", whether one considers the capital invested or the 
health and efficiency of the individuals concerned. How to 
secure a suitable food supply for the family, for the 
nation, is a live question that taxes the ingenuity alike of 
producer and consumer, of rich and poor, of legislator and 
statesman. It is quite time that the woman responsible for 
the selection and preparation of the food supply realize her 
responsibility as a distributor of the world's wealth and 
make serious preparation to meet this obligation wisely and 
well. The planning of meals is not a task for either the idle 
or the ignorant. It requires ability of a high order, know- 
ledge of many kinds, an intelligent appreciation of values, 
imagination to enable one to see the finished product, and 
executive ability to provide an attractive and suitable food 
supply three times a day, year in and year out. 

Author's Acknowledgment: — The author of this bulletin 
acknowledges the valuable help given by Mrs. Harriet Rinaker 
Howe and other members of the stafif in compiling the data for 
this publication. 



It is the purpose of this bulletin to contribute in a small 
way some data that may be helpful to the woman in- 
terested in studying the problem of the food supply. In be- 
ginning this study, it is assumed that the woman who plans 
the meals knows: 1, The amount of money she can spend 
for food; 2, The character and quantity of food her family 
needs, not desires; 3, The limitations of her market or 
cellar; 4, The limitations of preparation and service. These 
will be discussed in turn. 

1. The amount of money she can spend for food. Some 
interesting work has been done in finding out the propor- 
tion of different incomes to be expended for food. 

The work done by the Russell Sage Foundation in New 
York City, by the Massachusetts Commission, and by the 
British Board of Trade, on the cost of living all agree that a 
minimum income for a decent standard of living is not less 
than $600 per year for a normal family of father, mother, 
and three children, — a girl of ten and boys of six and four. 
This means an average of 22 cents per person per day for 
food. 

The New York Report says further that with an income 
of $700 or $800, if 25 cents per person per day is spent for 
food, a family can barely support itself, and that $825 per 
year is required to maintain a decent standard of living. It 
is interesting in this connection to note that statistics show 
that 60 to 70% of adult males earn less than $600 per year. 
This fact emphasizes the need of careful expenditure of in- 
come. 

Table I shows the proportion of incomes between $500 
and $2000 that should be expended for food. At present 
prices one would need to expend much ingenuity to provide 
an adequate food supply for five people for $1.20 per day, 
and yet that means an income of $1000. The table 
also shows that an income of $2000 does not mean that twice 
as much is to be expended for food as with a $1000 income.

2. The character and quantity of food her family needs, 
not desires. People often desire both in food and drinli: that 
which is not good for them. The requirement for food is 
modified by age, sex, and occupation, and this fact must be 
taken into consideration in the selection of the family diet- 
ary. The food requirement for a growing boy and that for 
an old man are very different and often provision must be 
made for both in one meal. The growing boy needs more 
food than the old man because of the fact of the boy's 
greater muscular activity and also his need for. material to 
supply more tissue for his growing body. The old man 
aeeds food for repair but not for growth ; also, his muscular 
activity is less than that of the boy, so that his total require- 
ment for food is less. See page 16. 

3. The limitations of her market or cellar. If the sup- 
ply of vegetables is limited to those grown on the farm, it is 
quite possible that the quantity and variety are less than 
they should be. Men accustomed to work in a ten- or forty- 
acre field feel very much hampered in a garden and are apt 
to regard such work as "putterin'." And yet a well-cared- 
for garden can be a real source of profit and satisfaction 
besides a valuable acquisition to the food supply. Many 
vegetables lose very much in flavor by being carted about, 
and hence all possible efforts should be made to encourage 
the home garden. A suggestion from one familiar with the 
difficulties of caring for a garden is to the effect that it 
should be long and narrow so that it may be worked by a 



6 

horse without too frequent turning, and that it should be 
located near the barn, preferably between that and the corn- 
field, so that it will be easy to "turn in" when passing to and 
from work. 

Even the small market is improved by the aid of the 
skilful buyer who makes reasonable demands. Lettuce is 
available in most places the year round. In a college town, 
it was found that fifty different vegetables were in market 
once a week during the winter, and the following fifteen 
can usually be found in season almost anywhere : parsnips, 
carrots, beets, turnips, rutabaga, Irish and sweet potatoes, 
cabbage, spinach, Brussel's sprouts, celery, cauliflower, 
squash, and radishes. The market man really wishes to 
satisfy his customers, and a persistent request from even a 
few women will bring results. 

4. The limitations of preparation and service. In most 
homes this is a large question. If one pair of hands must 
keep the house, take care of the children, do the laundry 
work, ansvi^er the door bell and telephone, and cook and 
serve meals between times, not many six-course dinners are 
to be expected. 

The woman is tempted always to get the food that will 
take the least time to prepare and, as will be shown later, 
Ihis often means that food of poorer quality is secured and 
at greater cost. 

Tests for Food 

All products have certain tests by which their value is 
determined. If a woman buys cotton or linen or china, she 
applies to it certain tests, such as "feel" and appearance, 
but in food the test is often limited to the one of appearance 
only. There are other and more important tests, however, 
to be applied to foods. Hutchison gives four, viz., chemical, 
physical, physiological, economic, and a fifth, psychological, 
may well be added. 

The Chemical Test. First, then, what is meant by the 
chemical test for a food? Women whose school days are 
far behind them are apt to turn away rather quickly at the 
suggestion of chemistry of foods, but the problem is not at 



all a difficult one. Since the Exposition in Chicago in 1893, 
there has been published a steadily increasing number of 
chemical analyses of food materials by which their compo- 
sition is known. Even the children in the schools know now 
that food materials are composed of nutrients, non-nutri- 
ents, and water, and statements like the following are in 
common use.

In other words, Table II shows that if a person buys 
a pound of round steak, she really gets about one-third of a 
pound of nutritive material ; of oysters, one-ninth ; of cheese, 
three- fourths; of prunes, two-thirds. The chemical test, 
then, enables one to know whether she is buying nutrients 
or refuse or water or all of these, and in what proportion. 

The Physical Test. Everyone understands that it re- 
quires energy to walk, talk, play, work, or rest, and that the 
real basis of this energy is the food eaten. The measuring 
unit used in determining this energy is not so familiar a 
unit a« the pound or the yard stick. It is the calorie, the 
amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one 
pound of water 4° Fahrenheit. Tables such as the follow- 
ing, giving the value in calories of many diiTerent food ma- 
terials, are in quite general use among dietitians.

The Physiological Test. Most people are more or less 
familiar with this test in some of its phases. For example, 
they say, "Eggs do not agree with me," or, "I cannot digest 
fresh bread." This test deals not only with the behavior of 
the food in the intestinal tract, but also with its absorption 
and assimilation in the body. 

The Economic Test. To many people this seems the 
most universal and important test, and yet, unless the other 
tests are understood, this one cannot be used wisely. It is 
not simply, "What does this fo6d cost?" but rather, "If I pay 
this money am I getting a fair supply of nutrients that my 
system can digest?" The chemical analysis may show 
that beeswax is rich in the elements found in food sub- 
stances, but what can the stomach do with it? 

It is well at this point to recall another of Hutchison's 
definitions. He says, "A good food contains an ample pro- 
portion of nutritive constituents which is easily digested and 
absorbed and which can be obtained at a reasonable cost." 

The Psychological Test. This test is of far greater im- 
portance than is generally understood. Scientific expert- 



9 

ments have demonstrated that both the desire for food, or 
appetite, and its satisfaction are greatly influenced by the 
impression the food makes on the mind or by the state of 
mind in which it is eaten. This is the philosophy which un- 
derlies the universal custom of choosing for the dinner hour 
a time free from care, congenial associates, attractive 
service, and the other accessories which add to the pleasure 
of a social hour. Few people are totally indifferent to the 
influence of well prepared food, a clean table cloth, or good 
company. 

Glasses op Food 
The purchaser of the family food supply should be fa- 
miliar with the general classes of food stuffs, the principal 
sources of each, and the work which each is supposed to do 
in maintaining the body. The division most familiar is an 
inheritance from the recreations of her childhood when the 
world and the fullness thereof belonged either to the animal, 
the vegetable, or the mineral kingdom. Science has shown 
that these kingdoms contain substances not so different as 
once supposed, so the classification of food materials is 
made not on the basis of their source but of the work they 
can do in the body. This body needs material such as pro- 
teins to supply the worn-out tissues and to make new cells. 
It needs material such as carbohydrates and fats to provide 
energy for its activities. It needs also certain mineral sub- 
stances for the bony structure or framework, and water, a 
cleansing agent within as well as without. Thus the classi- 
fication of food materials takes the following form : 
Food Materials 
Nitrogenous 
Protein 
Non-nitrogenous 
Carbohydrates 
Fats 
Mineral matters 
Water 

Examples of protein are the casein of cheese, the myosin 
of meat, and the gluten of wheat. The special work of pro- 
tein is to build and repair tissue, but it also yields energy. 

Familiar forms of carbohydrates are sugar and starch ; 
of fat, butter and olive oil. Both carbohydrates and fats 
give energy, but they do not build tissue. 



10 

The purchaser should understand that all foods contain 
water and that all yield energy, and also that most foods are 
combinations of what are known as the five food princi- 
ples. The woman does not expect to ask her butcher for 
protein, nor her grocer for carbohydrates, but she should 
know what to buy in order to secure protein or fat or car- 
bohydrates. The following tables may be helpful in de- 
termining food values and uses. 

Table IV shows the quantities of various foods that 
are required to equal a quart of milk in total nutrients. 

A quart of standard milk weighing 34.4 ounces con- 
tains 3.3% protein, 4% fat, 5% carbohydrate, and .7% min- 
eral matter, or 13% total nutrients, equal to 4.47 ounces.

It is evident from the first column of this table that 
when one buys a pound of round steak, one probably se- 
cures 32.1%, or about Vs pound, of nutritive materials; of 
cheese, about % pound ; and that a pound of either wheat 
flour, corn meal, dried navy beans, or macaroni, will mean 
about ®/io pound of nutritive material. 



11 



The second column shows how different quantities of 
various foods, because of difference in chemical composi- 
tion, yield equal weights of nutritive material. For example 
It requires 38.2 ounces of oysters to yield 4 ounces, or y' 
pound of nutrients, and only 13.9 ounces of beef round 
practically 3 times as much, by weight, of oysters as of beef' 
ihis IS one of the times when a pound does not seem to be 
a pound. This shows how much chemical analysis has 
nelped to determine real food value. 

Beef contains 32.1% nutrients; oysters, only 11 7% or 
about 1/3 as much as beef. So about 3 times as much o'ys- 
ters must be taken to secure an equal amount of nutrients 
1 he problem works out in this way ; 

?? 7^ ^l IP ^ ^-^i^^- nutrients in 13.9 oz. beef. 
Tn I'f w«^ ''^- =/-.^^?^- nutrients in 1 lb. oysters. 
oSo^ m,:^^ ^/- nutrients would require 4.46 -- 1 87 = 
2.38 Therefore 2.38 lb. oysters equal 13.9 oz. beef in 
total nutrients. 

The last column in this table helps to an appreciation 
of the terms "cheap" and "dear"; for example, 5 ounces of 
wheat flour, about 1 pound of round steak, and about 4 
pounds of oysters, yield about 1/4 pound of nutrients each 
and their cost varies as V,o of a cent, 14 cents, and 47 cents 
respectively. One is led to use the terms cheap and dear 
rather carefully in the face of these facts, and to understand 
why oysters are a luxury and wheat flour one of the cheap- 
est and best sources of protein. Even the despised prune 
shows good food value. 

Table V gives good examples of what are known as 
watery foods. One buys vegetables not for the amount of 
nutritive material, but for the mineral salts, water, and bulk 
which they give to the diet, as well as the attractiveness and 
freshness they add to a meal when prepared and served 
nicely. Moreover, asparagus, lettuce, and spinach give the 
necessary element of iron to the system in an attractive and 
useful form. This table is further interesting in showing 
how the calories, and consequently the fuel values, in- 
crease as the percentage of water decreases, and that, as a

whole, vegetables are low in nutritive value, but do supply- 
bulk and mineral salts. It is to be remembered that a cer- 
tain amount of the indigestible residue of vegetables has an 
important work to do in stimulating the movements of the 
alimentary canal. The so-called "predigested foods" and 
animal foods in general lack this "indigestible residue." 

Table VI shows the composition of two attractive and 
widely dilTering forms of food. Fruits are high in water 
content; nuts, low. The nutrient of fruits is very largely 
sugar, while nuts are relatively rich in fat and protein. The 
high food value of bananas, prunes, figs, dates, and raisins, 
because of their sugar, should not be overlooked, neither 
the high value in calories of the various nuts. One realizes 
that a dessert of fresh fruits might add a pleasing flavor and 
not much nutritive material to a meal, while a dessert of 
nuts might be entirely too heavy.

Table VII shows yet another method of estimating food 
values, viz., their heat value or "calories per pound." 

In some sanitariums, the daily menu is given in terms 
of calories instead of the usual a la carte form. Perhaps the 
day v^^ill come when the housekeeper will order her food in 
calories instead of pounds. 

In this table it is easy to see that corn meal and wheat 
flour still deserve honorable mention, and that cross ribs of 
beef appear much cheaper than round steak, while the fig- 
ures for corned beef and rice are somewhat surprising. Per- 
haps more surprising is the comparison that may be made 
in the cost of whole milk and round steak. Even at 10 cents 
per quart, which is at least two or three times as much as 
milk costs the farmer, it is cheaper than round steak at 15 
cents per pound. If these facts were better understood, a 
more liberal use of whole milk might prevail.

The calorie as a unit of measure is not so improbable 
as at first considered because it develops that 100 calories 
frequently means the amount usually served one person, of 
bread, mashed potatoes, and meat. 

The accompanying menu card, Table VIII, shows the 
calorie portion in actual use. 

No hard and fast rules can be given as to the total 
calories required by an individual for a day's ration, be- 
cause so many factors, such as age, size, and occupation 
enter into the problem. This requirement is usually esti- 
mated in kilograms per pound of body weight. (A kilogram 
is 2.2 pounds.) Sherman^ estimates that children of from 
10 to 13 years of age require 70 to 60 calories per day per 
kilogram of body weight; of from 14 to 17 years, 60 to 45

calories per kilogram; while the need of middle-aged men 
and women with moderate exercise is 40 to 45 calories per 
kilogram of body weight. He further emphasizes this dif- 
ference in food requirement for different ages by a table in 
which it is shown that the boy of 10, without muscular 
labor, requires 70 calories per Idlo of body weight; the boy 
of 15, under similar circumstances, 56 calories ; the man of 
40, 36 calories ; the man of 60, 34 calories ; and the man of 
80, 27 calories. This latter statement in terms of pounds 
would read thus:

Table X deals with the more expensive foods. It 
shows that rib roast and white fish, at the same price per 
pound, have a very different value in calories of fuel value, 
while sweetbreads at 80 cents per pound are cheaper per 
100-calorie portion than chicken broilers at 30 cents per 
pound, also that the difference in price between porterhouse 
and tenderloin of beef is not warranted by the cost per 
calorie portion. Note also the contrasts afforded by a com- 
parison of beef heart^ and tenderloin represented by the cost 
price of 5 cents per pound and 60 cents per pound, respec- 
tively, with a difference of only 10 in fuel value per pound. 
Truly, flavor has a high place, as it should, in food values.

Most women feel more at a loss in the selection of 
cuts of meat than of almost any other single article of food. 
A daily visit to the meat market for about two weeks, with a 
study of meat charts, will familiarize one with cuts by the 
name the local butcher gives them. These names vary in 
different localities, and it is well to begin by understanding 
one man's terms well. Then the problem remains of the 
choice and use of these different cuts. There are people to 
whom nothing is so desirable as a juicy steak, and with 
them an attempt to substitute a cheaper cut results in a large 
expenditure of time, gas, and energy with very unsatisfac- 
tory results. Those who have had that experience will be 
interested in seeing how little porterhouse and chuck rib 
differ in the net price per pound of edible meat. Many 
savory dishes are made from the cheaper cuts of meat, but 



18 

sometimes in estimating the value of this cheaper dish, 
the time and the labor involved are forgotten. There are 
people who prefer one good steak one day and no meat the 
n^xt to a daily offering of cheap cuts or meat substitutes. 
Table XI emphasizes again the large proportion of edible 
meat the rump yields.

One other factor w^hich enters into the cost of food is 
its seasonableness. If the dweller in the North v^dll have 
strawberries in mid-winter, she must expect to pay the cost 
of transportation and the consequent loss entailed by the 
process. The wise buyer does not expect to buy sugar in the 
canning season, but in January or February, and she pre- 
pares her own cold storage eggs for the winter of her need.

Table XIII suggests many questions, some of which 
are not easily answered. Two meals, one of "homemade," 
the other of commercial foods, were served to thirteen peo- 
ple, the former at a cost of 16 cents per person, and the lat- 
ter at a cost of 25 cents per person. Those who partook of 
the food said that the "homemade" had much the better 
flavor. The one notable exception to the general rule that 
the "homemade" was cheapest was found in the cake, which 
cost more money than the "store" one and tasted "twice a? 
good." 

It may be necessary to prepare a meal from commer- 
cial goods, but one ought to do it understanding what the 
facts are and not labor under the delusion that one is saving 
both time and money. It sometimes happens that this ap- 
parent necessity of using canned goods is due to the fact 
that the planning of the meals has been neglected until it is 
too late to secure and cook supplies, so a visit to the grocer 
and a supply of canned goods seems necessary.

Table XIV brings up another phase of buying, viz., in 
bulk or in package, the large quantity or the small. The 
answer to that question depends upon several things, — upon 
the amount of storage room available, whether the goods 
purchased keep well, whether one has money to buy in quan- 
tity, whether one has time to prepare the food from the raw 
materials. The examples given show the economy of 
buying in the larger quantity. Anyone expecting to use 
olive oil would certainly prefer to buy it at the rate of $3.50 
per gallon rather than at $6.40 by the pint bottle. It is also 
clear that one would not care to pay 16 cents per quart for 
gelatin when it can be had for 6 cents.

Table XV is interesting because it shows com- 
parative costs due to both quality of food and to method of 
preparation. It is convenient to know how much more a 
meal costs when porterhouse steak is used instead of Ham- 
burg, or the difference in cost between nut bread and butter 
rolls, and how escalloped and fried potatoes compare in 
cost. With these data one could plan an expensive meat 
with cheaper vegetables, or vice versa.

One very important factor in the cost of ttie day's food 
is the character and amount of fuel used. The following 
data was obtained by Mrs. Harriet Rinaker Howe in her 
study of economy of fuels. (See Home Economics Journal, 
Vol. 1, p. 416.)

The menu was as follows: 

Breakfast: Cereal, Bacon, Biscuits, Apples, Coffee 
Lunch: Sponge Cake, Croquettes, Peas, Cocoa, Rolls 
Dinner: Soup, Bread, Roast, Coffee, Dressing 



23 

In this particular instance to cook the three identical 
meals for one day required 32.5 pounds of coal, 147.32 cubic 
feet of gas, 10,007 watt hours of electricity, at a cost of 
$,.0813 for coal, $.1839 for gas, $.50 for electricity; or, to put 
it another way, the cost of cooking by gas was 2.26 times, 
and of electricity 6.15 times as great as that of cooking by 
coal. In this experiment, coal was $5.00 per ton, gas $1.25 
per 1000 cubic feet, and electricity, 5 cents per watt hour. 
As Mrs. Howe says, at these same prices, $1.00 invested in 
coal would provide for the same amount of cooking as $2.26 
invested in gas, or $6.15 invested in electric current. 

It may appear to the reader that it takes a long time by 
this process to get ready to plan a meal, but not all of this in- 
formation is of necessity to be secured before there is any 
practice. In this, as in most efforts, one learns by doing, but 
one should have in mind some basis from which to proceed 
and some goal to be attained. Practice makes for perfec- 
tion in this as in other arts. The ultimate aim of the house- 
wife in regard to the food supply is to provide, at a reason- 
able cost, a diet adapted to the needs of her family, one that 
shall have the necessary constituents in due proportion and 
in an attractive and varied form. The family purse must be 
considered and family needs must decide the time of the 
meals and their character. The custom is quite universal 
of serving each day one meal consisting of a greater variety 
and quantity of food than either of the other two. This meal 
is known as the dinner and consists usually of a meat, one 
or tw^o vegetables, a salad, a dessert, and coffee or tea if de- 
sired. With formal dinners, a soup and fish course are often 
used. Dinner is eaten at mid-day or at night. 

The lunch or supper consists usually of one hot dish, 
made, it may be, from the meat left from dinner, or a cheese 
dish, or some people prefer the soup with this meal. Then 
the order is soup, cold meat or salad, sauce and cake, and 
hot drink as preferred. 

Opinions and practice differ greatly as regards the 
breakfast. In these later years, the town dweller has come 
to use more largely the French breakfast of rolls and coffee, 
but the farmer who does an hour's good work before break- 



24 

fast, wishes something more substantial and finds ham and 
eggs, creamed potatoes, toast, coffee, and fruit more to his 
Uking. 

Rules for the Planning op Meals 

With these facts in mind, some definite rules may be 
given for the planning of meals. 

1. Take one whole day, at least, as a unit. Two or 
three are better because they prevent repetition of the same 
article. In actual practice many people find from Monday 
to Thursday a good working plan. , 

2. Try to have representatives of all the food principles 
at each meal, — not too much of protein or fat or carbohy- 
drate. To that end, do not have meat and macaroni and 
cheese together, nor rice and potatoes, nor fried potatoes and 
doughnuts. 

There has been much misunderstanding about the term 
"balanced rations." One would get the impression from 
many of the statements made that Nature checks accounts 
after each meal, and that one must have just the right pro- 
portion of each food at each meal. As a matter of fact, we 
live today on what we ate yesterday, and we do well if we 
keep the balance within the day. It is possible that one may 
get as much protein in the dinner as in the other two meals 
combined, or that the lunch may give a large proportion of 
starchy food. But there is a kind of balance to be secured 
by observing the following rules. 

3. A clear soup and an ice, instead of a cream soup 
and heavy dessert, should be used with a substantial main 
course; or if one wishes to use a rich soup and a heavy 
dessert, such as plum pudding, the main course should be 
lighter. 

4. Do not repeat the same food even in different forms 
in the same meal, as tomato soup and tomato salad. Use 
fruit for the salad. 

5. Make some contrast between courses. Monotony and 



25 

a general grayness or deadly dullness are not any more de- 
sirable in food than in people. Hamburg steak, canned 
corn and mashed potatoes, leave one wishing for something 
to give snap and character to the meal. Tomato sauce and 
baked potato would add color, flavor, and character. 

6. Make combinations pleasing in appearance and 
color. Have the salad an attractive color and fresh, the 
pastry crisp, the bread a good brown. 

The question of variety, of which one hears so much, 
cannot be disposed of in a single sentence. One must first 
have a definition of what is meant by variety. To some peo- 
ple, it means cucumbers and strawberries in mid-winter; 
in other words, out-of-season foods : to others, it means 
five kinds of vegetables and two kinds of pie and cake at one 
meal: to still others, differer' methods of preparing the 
same article; for example, five ways of preparing potatoes. 
The cost of the out-of-season foods prohibits for most people 
the first method for obtaining variety. The abundance indi- 
cated in the next method defeats its own purpose, besides 
giving too much food at one meal. Mrs. Richards said once 
that ten staple articles represent nine-tenths of the average 
food supply for a family. It is easy, then, to see that at the 
rate of five vegetables in one meal one soon exhausts the 
available supply and brings repetition rather than variety. 
The method of securing variety coming into more general 
favor is, 

(a) By the use of a few materials at a time; and, 

(b) By different methods of preparing the same article. 
The man who was offered a choice of four kinds of 

meat for breakfast for a month secured variety by deciding 
that he would have no meat for breakfast ; that was reserved 
for dinner. The woman who had mashed potatoes every 
night for dinner for three months, was greatly relieved to 
be given a baked potato. 

The following menus^ show the use of four com- 
mon foods, beef, cabbage, apples, and potatoes, for twelve 
meals, differently prepared each time. This is a satisfactory 
and feasible way of obtaining a pleasing variety.

In the preceding pages there have been indicated some 
of the factors that enter into the cost and preparation of 
food, and some of the knowledge necessary to the skilful 
buying of it, as well as to the successful planning of meals. 

If this bulletin helps women to a better appreciation 
of the possibilities and satisfactions of this phase of the 
work, it will have accomplished its purpose.
