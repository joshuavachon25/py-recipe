INTRODUCTION 

A BOOK OF RECIPES FOR THE COOKING SCHOOL 

This book of recipes is prepared for the use of the many 
teachers and students of cooking who feel the need of standard 
recipes for the every-day dishes with directions simply and 
concisely stated. 

The book represents a compilation of recipes that have 
been in use in cooking schools of the country for many years. 
It is not designed for the use of experienced cooks who are 
seeking a wider variety and a greater elaboration of recipes 
but for the young cook who desires to prepare simple dishes 
well. Each recipe has been carefully tested and every care 
has been taken to state the directions definitely. In every class 
which has used the recipes and with every teacher with whom 
the compiler has worked, suggestions, criticisms, and improve- 
ments have been made, so that the book represents the combined 
labors of many students of cooking. The chapter on Food 
Preservation contains the material used in a Hampton leaflet 
prepared with the aid of Miss Alma Kruse whose faithful la- 
bors made its completion possible. 

To all who have thus aided in the preparation of the 
recipes sincerest gratitude is hereby expressed, and the com- 
piler hopes that this publication will be the means of extend- 
ing to young teachers the benefits of practices that have proved 
of value in manv schools of cooking:. 



COOKING 

Cooking is the preparation of food for the table by. dressing 
it or by the application of heat in some manner. 

The processes of cooking include the preparation, se- 
lection, and changing of natural food products with the aid of 
the various kinds of heat or with the assistance of the various 
processes of fermentation or through the agency of different ad- 
mixtures. 

The reasons for cooking foods stated briefly are as follows : 

1 To make the food attractive. Example — meats. 

2 To make the food palatable. Example — eggs. 

3 To make the food digestible and nourishing. Ex- 

ample — potatoes, cereals, breads. 

4 To destroy parasites and germs. Example — in water, 

milk, pork, oysters. 

5 To introduce heat into the body and stimulate the 

digestive organs. Example — soups and beverages. 
The methods of cooking may be summarized as follows: 

1 In a medium of dry heat. 

a Cooking by direct application of intense heat — 

broiling and toasting, 

b Cooking by indirect application of intense heat — 

roasting and baking. 

2 In a medium of moist heat. 

a Cooking by direct application of hot w-ater — 

boiling and stewing, 
b Cooking by direct application of steam — steaming, 
c Cooking by indirect contact with boiling water — 

double boiler. 

3 In a medium of hot fat. 

Cooking; bv direct contact with hot fat. 



a Frying, in a large amount of fat. 
b Sauteing, in a small amount of fat. 

4 By direct contact with heated metal — Pan-broiling. 

5 Cooking by means of a combination of moist air and 
dry air. (Stewing and baking.) 

a Braizing and pot-roasting in a kettle. 

b Casserole cookery in a covered casserole in oven. 

6 Cooking by means of a combination of hot fat and 

hot water (frying and stewing) — Fricasseeing. 
The results of cooking foods are: 

1 Physical. Examples — softening of cellulose, lique- 

faction of gelatine. 

2 Chemical. Examples — changes in starch, splitting 

up of fats, action of baking powder. 

3 Bacteriological. Examples — destruction of germs 

in meats, milk, and fruits, or cultivation of germ 
life as in preparation of bread, cheese and butter. 

Success in cooking depends upon intelligent handling of 
materials and control of the cooking medium. It is as essen- 
tial to know how to buy and how to prepare the food as it is 
to know how to cook it. Absolute cleanliness must be exer- 
cised in handling food and this can best be secured by orderly 
procedure in carrying on the work. Accuracy of measurement 
is the only means of securing uniform results. A complete 
knowledge of the stove and how to regulate it, is essential if 
the cook is to find joy in her work. 

Good food materials must be used to secure good results. 
This does not mean that the foods of highest price must always 
be purchased Ijut that everything used must be in good condi- 
tion. Cheaper fats can often be substituted for butter when 
cooking. So long as such fats are fresh and of delicate flavor 
the resulting cooked dishes will be satisfactory. Though but- 
ter is very generally named as the fat to be used in the recipes, 



it is hoped that the housewife will often substitute cheaper fats 
that give satisfaction. Oleomargarine has long proved its use- 
fulness as a fat to be relied upon in cooking and can well be 
substituted for butter in batters of all sorts. Lard and beef 
drippings can serve to replace butter in many bread and pastry 
recipes. It may be found necessary to alter the amount of fat 
used as the kind is varied. 

The fireless cooker can advantageously be used for many 
of the longer processes of cooking. After the food has been 
well heated through and the cooking process has begun, the 
dishes may be placed in the fireless cooker to complete the cook- 
ing. For cereals and stews that require very long cooking the 
fireless cooker is a great aid to the housewife relieving her of 
the necessity of watching the cooking and at the same time 
economizing the amount of fuel used. 

GENERAL RULES TO FOLLOW IN USING RECIPES 

Accuracy of measurement is absolutely necessary in order 
to secure uniform results. Although greater accuracy can be se- 
cured by making all measurements by weight, the average 
housekeeper is not provided with scales that are sufficiently 
accurate to make the weighing of small quantities feasible; 
therefore, the recipes are given with quantities indicated by 
cup and spoon measurements. 

Use a standard measuring cup that holds one half pint. 

Make all cup and spoon measurements level. 

Measure a fraction of a cupful or of a spoonful carefully. 

Sift dry ingredients before measuring and measure them 
lightly. 

Pack butter and lard when measuring in a cup or spoon. 

Measure all dry ingredients first, before measuring but- 



ter or liquids, in order to economize in the number of utensils 
necessary. 

Table of Measurements 

1 measuring cup = j.-^ pint 
16 tablespoonsful = 1 cup 
3 teaspoonsful = 1 tablespoon. 

BEVERAGES 

COFFEE 

AA'hen possible it is desirable that coffee be roasted shortly 
before it is to be prepared and ground at the time of making, 
as the flavor is quickly lost after roasting, particularly if the 
coffee be ground. Therefore unless purchased in small quan- 
tities, it is best kept unroasted. Roasted coffee must be kept in 
well covered containers. 

The purpose in cooking coffee is to extract the essential oil 
and caffeine and at the same time draw out as little of the tannic 
acid as possible. 

Coffee is prepared by filtration, percolation, and boiling. 
The first two methods extract the essential oil and caffeine with 
but little of the tannic acid. If boiled coffee is carefully made 
the amount of tannic acid drawn out is small. Coffee should 
not be boiled for more than eight minutes. 

When coffee is to be reheated, it should not be left on the 
grounds as added cooking tends to draw out the tannic acid. 

Two level tablespoons of coffee are allowed for each cup 
to be served. 

Coffee is at its best served "black'' or clear. Hot milk 
and cream are served in coffee. When milk or cream and sugar 
are added the food value of the coffee is increased, as is also 
the work of digestion. 



Boiled Coffee 

1 cup coarsely ground coffee 5 cups boiling water 

Yz cup cold water (freshly boiling) 

Yi white of egg and egg shell ^ cup cold water, 
(crushed) 

^Mix the coffee with ^ cup cold water, the white of egg and 
shell and add boiling water. Boil 8 minutes, pour out 1 cup of 
coffee, and return to the coffee pot; add ^ cup cold water and 
let settle 5 minutes. A rich coffee, excellent for after-dinner cof- 
fee. Serves 8 to 10 cups. 

The egg may be omitted and the coffee grounds tied in a 
small piece of cheesecloth and removed from the coffee pot after 
the coffee has been boiled 8 minutes. 

Filtered Coffee 

1 cup very finely ground coffee 

5 cups boiling water (freshly boiling) 

Scald a filter coffee pot. Put the coffee into the upper 
part of the coffee pot and pour the boiling water slowly through 
it. The coffee pot must be kept hot while the coffee is being 
made. Serves 8. 

Percolated Coffee 

Yz cup finely ground coffee 3 cups water 

Put the coffee in the upper part of the percolator and the 
water in the lower part. Heat the water and allow it to perco- 
late through the coffee for 20 minutes. Serves 6. 

Cereal Coffee 

1 cup cereal coffee. 5 cups boiling water (freshly boiling) 
Yi cup cold water 

Mix the coffee with cold water, add the boiling water; boil 
20 minutes, let settle 5 minutes, and serve hot. Serves 8. 



TEA 

There is a great variety of good teas on the market, both 
black and green. The choice of tea is largely a matter of in- 
dmdual preference. 

Tea should always be kept in a tightly covered can or jar 
to protect it from the air and moisture, because of the volatile 
oil present. 

In the preparation of the beverage the purpose is to draw 
out the volatile oil and caffeine from the leaf into the water. 
Boiling water must be poured over the leaves to obtain these 
results and if the water is then allowed to stand on the leaves 
without boiling for only three or four minutes, the best results 
are obtained. A longer infusion draws out the bitter and harm- 
ful tannic acid, making the beverage not only unpleasant to the 
taste but also harmful to the body. 

As tannic acid acts on some metals, it is not desirable to 
use a metal tea pot. China and earthen ware are best; earthen 
ware is especially desirable, because it holds the heat. 

The tea pot should be scalded out and heated before the 
tea is put in. The w^ater used should be freshly boiling and the 
tea pot tightly covered during the infusion. 

A tea strainer or tea ball may be used to prepare one cup 
of tea at a time. The tea cup must be scalded and boiling 
w^ater poured over the tea leaves. 

One cannot economize in the preparation of tea by allowing 
a longer time for steeping for that ruins the beverage, ^^'hen 
a stronger tea is desired, more leaves must be used. 

Tea is at its best served clear; lemon is often added (Rus- 
sian tea) ; cloves and candied orange peel give a pleasing 
variety; cream and sugar are much used, and increase the food 
value of the beverage. 



Tea 

1 teaspoon green tea or 2 cups boiling water 

2 teaspoons black tea (freshly boiling) 
Scald the teapot, put the tea in the teapot and pour boiling 

water over it. Cover closely but do not boil. Steep 3 minutes, 
strain, and serve, adding hot water if desired. Serves 4. 

Iced Tea 

Follow recipe for tea using double the quantity of tea 
called for. Strain and set aside to cool. Chill and serve with 
chipped ice and sliced lemon. Black tea is more desirable for 
iced tea. 

CHOCOLATE 

An unsweetened chocolate gives the best results for cook- 
ing purposes. 

Chocolate may become rancid if kept too long because of 
the large amount of fat present. Moisture and heat must be 
excluded from both chocolate and cocoa in order to keep them in 
good condition. It is well to keep chocolate in a tightly covered 
tin box. 

The purpose of cooking chocolate and cocoa is to develop 
flavor, to cook the starch, and to combine with other food mater- 
ials as a flavor. For cooking purposes unsweetened chocolate 
gives the best results. When cakes rich in chocolate are baked 
some soda is required because of the presence of fatty acids in 
the chocolate. 

Heat readily reduces chocolate to a smooth paste which 
burns easily; therefore chocolate should be cooked at a moderate 
temperature. 

Both chocolate and cocoa should be combined with sugar 
and a small amount of the liquid and cooked to a smooth paste 
before adding the full quantity of liquid. 

Chocolate should be cooked only a short time in order to 
avoid the separation of the fat. 



Cocoa should be cooked half an hour in order to cook the 
starch thoroughly and to develop flavor. 

Water can always be substituted for milk in the recipes 
and the result will still be good though the beverage will not be 
so rich. For a richer beverage cream may be added. 

Both condensed and evaporated milk give excellent 
results with chocolate and cocoa and may entirely replace sweet 
milk. If the condensed milk is used, sugar need not be added. 

The process of "milling*' or whipping is necessary after 
cooking chocolate or cocoa in order to avoid formation of the 
albuminous skin over the beverage. 

Chocolate and cocoa are served plain or with cream. The 
cream may be plain or whipped and the whipped cream may be 
sweetened or unsweetened. Sometimes the well-beaten white of 
an egg is added to the whipped cream to increase its volume. 

Chocolate 

1 qt. milk or 2 oz. chocolate. 

1 qt. milk and water. ys cup sugar , 

Melt the chocolate over hot water, add the sugar and then, 
the hot liquid slowly; boil 5 minutes directly over the heat, 
beat well and serve. A richer beverage may be made by using 
3 ounces of chocolate. Serves 8 to 10. 

Cocoa 

^ cup cocoa Icup water 

^cup sugar 3 cups milk 

^lix the cocoa and sugar with the water and boil 10 min- 
utes; stir into the hot milk and then cook in double boiler yi 
hour. Serves 8 to 10. 

FRUIT BEVERAGES 

Beverages prepared from fresh fruits and served cold are 
welcome and refreshing in hot weather and are frequently use- 
ful during sickness. 



10 



The citrus fruits usually form the basis of such fruit bever- 
ages and can be used alone or in combination with other fruits. 

The recipes can be varied as different fruits are in season 
and as use is made of the various canned fruit juices. 

Sugar should be used with discretion in fruit beverages 
and water should be added as necessary. The quantities of 
sugar and water used in the recipes will have to be varied ac- 
cording to the acidity and strength of the fruit juices. 

Strawberries, cherries, diced pineapple and sliced bananas 
are used as garnish in fruit drinks. 

Lemonade 

Yz cup lemon juice 1 quart water 

1 cup sugar 
Add sugar to lemon juice and stir until sugar is dis- 
solved. Add cold water, stir well, strain and add more water if 
desired. Serve very cold. 

The juice of one lemon equals 3 tablespoons. Allow 1^ 
tablespoons juice to each glass. Serves 6. 

Orangeade 

6 oranges 1 cup sugar 

2 lemons, juice 1 quart water 

Add the sugar to the juice of the oranges and lemons and 
stir until the sugar is dissolved. If desired add grated rind of 
one half lemon and one half orange. Add cold water, strain, 
and serve cold. Serves 6 to 8.

cloves and grated rind of one lemon. Boil 5 min. Steep the tea 
with one pint boiling water for 3 min. Strain and add to the 
syrup. Add the lemon and orange juice strained and the 
shredded pineapple. Serve very cold. Serves 6 to 8. 

Grape Juice Punch 

1 pint grape juice ^4 cup sugar 

2 lemons 1 quart water 

Add the juice of the lemons and the sugar to the grape 
juice and stir until the sugar is dissolved. Add the water, strain 
and serve very cold. The strength of the grape juice will vary,, 
hence more grape juice and more sugar may be required. Serves 
6 to 8. 



VEGETABLES 

Vegetables should be used when they are in season, as they 
are always cheapest and at their best then. One should select 
those that are fresh and of good quality. Those of medium 
size are usually best. They should be kept in a cold, dark, 
dry place until ready to use. 

Cooking of Vegetables 

Vegetables are cooked to soften the cellulose, to cook the 
starch, and to develop the flavor. Methods of cooking com- 
monly employed for vegetables are boiling, steaming, baking and 
frying. 

Prepare vegetables by washing thoroughly, with a small 
scrub brush, and paring or scraping, if the skins are to be re- 
moved. They are always better if the skin is not removed be- 
fore cooking and if they are kept as nearly whole as possible. 
After paring put all vegetables into cold water until ready to 
cook, to keep them crisp and to prevent their being discolored. 
If withered let them stand in cold water for some time. 

Cellulose forms the basis for the framework of all vege- 
tables. In old or exceedingly large vegetables this cellulose 
may be very tough, hence longer cooking may be required. In 
most vegetables the cellulose is more coarse in one part of the 
vegetable than in the others. Cabbage has a coarse mid-rib of 
cellulose. Celery has strings of cellulose down the stalk. Car- 
rots have a tough center of cellulose which becomes very hard 
in the old vegetable. Turnips have a heavy layer of cellulose 
on the outside. 

General Directions for Cooking Vegetables in Water 

Strong flavored vegetables ( as turnips, onions, cabbage, and 
cauliflower) may be cooked uncovered in rapidly boiling water 
in order to drive off some of the odor and flavor. 

12 



13 



Delicately-flavored vegetables (as spinach, asparagus, and 
green peas) are best if cooked uncovered, slowly, in a small 
amount of boiling water until the vegetable is tender and the 
water boils away. 

Starchy vegetables (as potatoes, carrots and parsnips) 
should be cooked in a sufficiently large amount of boiling water 
to cover them. The water should boil gently and the kettle be 
kept covered. 

Water should be kept boiling continuously while vegetables 
are cooking. If it is necessary to replenish water, boiling water 
should be added. When vegetables are partially cooked, add 1 
teaspoonful salt to each quart of water. Cook until vegetable 
can be easily pierced with a fork. 

All boiled vegetables should be drained well as soon as 
tender if an excess of water has been used. After cooking 
season with salt and pepper and serve hot with butter or white 
sauce. 

When practicable it is better to steam than to boil vege- 
tables, because there is less loss of food value. Put the 
vegetables on a plate in the steamer, cover closely, set over 
boiling water, and keep the water boiling steadily until the 
vegetables are tender. 

Proportions for seasoning 1 cup vegetables are ^ teaspoon 
salt, % teaspoon pepper, ^ tablespoon butter. Proportions for 
medium white sauce are 2 tablespoons butter, 2 tablespoons 
flour, 1 cup liquid, 1 teaspoon salt, ^ teaspoon pepper — suf- 
ficient for 2 cups cooked vegetables. 

All dried vegetables should be soaked in cold water before 
cooking. Because of the large amount of tough skin on dried 
peas and beans both soaking and cooking may require several 
hours. If water contains much lime it does not soften them 
readily, hence it is sometimes desirable to add a little soda to the 
water to precipitate the lime.

ASPARAGUS 

Asparagus should be used while young and fresh, and 
should be carefully cooked in order to preserve the delicate 
flavor. Its food value is not high, but it is always a welcome 
addition to the diet and is of value because of the mineral mat- 
ter it contains. It can be served cold in salads as well as hot 
with meat and potatoes. 

Boiled Asparagus 

Wash, trim, remove the woody part of the stems, and tie 
asparagus in bundles, or cut in 1-inch lengths. Put in salted 
w^ater and boil slowly in an uncovered saucepan until stalks 
are tender. Season v^dth butter, salt, and pepper, or with a 
white sauce. Serve on hot toast if desired. 

BEANS 

Beans are a valuable vegetable for the table, either served 
green in the pod or matured and removed from the shell. 



15 



Green String or Wax Beans 

Green beans do not have high nutritive value but they 
supply valuable minerals and needed bulk. They may be 
boiled, seasoned, and served as an accompaniment to the meat 
course. Cream or white sauce may be added before serving. 
Salt pork may be cooked with the beans to give additional flavor. 
Cold cooked beans may be used in salads. 

Dried Beans 

Mature beans provide a good meat substitute and may be 
cooked in a variety of ways. Baked beans and bean soup are 
probably the most popular methods of using dried beans. 

Boston Baked Beans 

1 quart navy beans 2 tablespoons molasses 

1 tablespoon salt 1 cup boiling water 

y2 tablespoon mustard ^ pound fat salt pork 

3 tablespoons sugar Boiling water to cover. 

Pick beans over and soak in cold water over night. 
In the morning drain, cover with fresh water, and heat 
slowly until the skins burst, but do not let the beans become 
broken. 

Scald Yi pound fat salt pork; scrape it; put a slice in the 
bottom of the bean pot. Cut the remaining pork across top in 
' strips just through the rind, and bury the pork in the beans, 
leaving the rind exposed. 

Add 1 cup boiling water to seasonings and pour over the 
beans. Cover with boiling water. Bake slowly, adding more 
water as necessary. Bake from 6 to 8 hours; uncover at the last 
so that the water will evaporate and beans browoi on top. 
Serves 12. 

Green Lima Beans or Butter Beans 

Cover 1 quart of the shelled beans with boiling water. Boil 
up quickly at first, then boil slowly until done (45 to 60 



16 



minutes), allowing water to boil away at the last. When tender 
pour off a part of the water if too much remains. Season the 
beans with a teaspoonful of salt and 3 tablespoonfuls of butter, 
or serve with a white sauce. 

BEETS 

The whole of the young beet plant, including the root, may 
be pulled and used while fresh for "greens." It is valuable for 
the organic acids and minerals it provides. When more nearly 
mature the beet is boiled without the tops. The mature beet 
may be stored and kept through the winter and if boiled till 
tender is excellent as a source of sugar and starch, thus pro- 
viding heat and energy to the body and giving a welcome varia- 
tion in the vegetable foods. Care must be taken in handling and 
cooking beets not to break the skin or injure the beet, for the 
soluble sugar and attractive coloring are easily lost. Beets are 
sometimes pickled and used as a relish, and are an attractive 
addition to vegetable salads. 

Boiled Beets 

Wash the beets, leaving 2 or 3 inches of the top on until 
cooked, and cook whole until tender. Young beets will cook in 
1 hour, old beets require a longer time. Put in cold water, 
pare, slice and reheat with butter, salt, and pepper. The butter 
may be omitted and vinegar used or the beets may be cut in 
small cubes and served in a white sauce. 

BRUSSELS SPROUTS 

Brussels sprouts are of the same class as the cabbage and 
are prepared, cooked and seasoned in the same way, but because 
of their small size, it is possible to leave them whole. 



17 



CABBAGE 

Cabbage can be used in many ways, both uncooked and 
cooked. Prolonged cooking renders cabbage somewhat difficult 
of digestion; therefore care should be taken to cook cabbage 
only long enough to soften the cellulose. 

Boiled Cabbage 

Cut cabbage in quarters and soak 3^ hour in cold salt 
water to draw out any insects. Cut in large pieces or chop 
evenly. Cook till tender in a large amount of boiling salted 
water about 20 minutes. Leave kettle uncovered. Drain and 
serve with butter, salt, and pepper or with a drawn butter sauce 
flavored with vinegar. 

Creamed Cabbage 

1 pint boiled cabbage 1 recipe white sauce 

White Sauce 

2 tablespoons butter ^ teaspoon white 

or other fat pepper 

2 tablespoons flour 1 cup milk, heated 

1 teaspoon salt 
Heat the butter. When it bubbles add flour and seasonings, 
add hot milk gradually, stirring constantly and allowing the 
mixture to thicken and bubble each time before adding another 
portion of the milk. Boil up once and sauce is ready to serve. 
Pour the white sauce over the boiled cabbage, heat till 
bubbling, and serve hot. Serves 6 or 8. 

Scalloped Cabbage 

3 cups chopped cabbage 1 Yz cups milk 

2 tablespoons butter or 1 cup bread crumbs, to 

other fat which 

3 tablespoons flour 1 tablespoon butter or 
3/2 teaspoon salt other fat is added 
y^ teaspoon white pepper 



18 



Boil cabbage until tender, drain well, put into a well- 
greased baking dish, and pour over it a white sauce made of the 
butter, flour, salt, pepper, and milk. Cover with the buttered 
crumbs. Bake in a moderate oven until the crumbs are a golden 
brown, about 15 minutes. Serves 6 or 8. 

The same recipe may be used to prepare scalloped potatoes, 
scalloped corn, scalloped asparagus, scalloped cauliflower, scal- 
loped onions, and scalloped carrots. ( See scalloped dishes). 

Cabbage Boiled with Pork or Corned Beef 

If cabbage is to be cooked with boiled salt pork or corned 
beef, add to it the boiled meat one-half hour before it is to be 
served and boil vigorously until tender, leaving the kettle un- 
covered. 

Sauer Kraut 

See directions for making sauer kraut. 
When ready to use sauer kraut, drain it and boil till tender 
in hot water or cook in hot fat. Season to taste. 

Sauer Kraut with Fresh Pork 

Cover sauer kraut with boiling water, add fresh pork and 
boil until the meat is very tender and falls from the bones. Re- 
move bones. Season to taste. 

CARROTS 

Delicate young carrots procured from the garden during 
the summer and fall are an acceptable addition to the daily 
menu. They may be cooked alone or combined with meat dishes, 
soups, and salads to give added flavor. Older carrots may be kept 
for use through the winter if stored in a cool, dry place. They 
are used in the same ways that young carrots are used but are 
more tough in texture and stronger in flavor than young carrots. 
The outside skin of the carrot may be removed by scraping after 
it has been thoroughly scrubbed. Carrots have considerable 



19 



nutritive value because of the sugar, starch, and mineral matter 
which they contain. They provide needed bulk to the diet and 
may be used with meats or iish when some more juicy vegetable 
is served at the same meal. 

Creamed Carrots 

1 pint carrots. 

1 recipe medium white sauce (see creamed cabbage) 
Scrape the carrot slightly; then cut into large dice or slices. 
Young carrots may be cooked whole. If the heart of old car- 
rots is hard and woody, remove it before cooking. Put into a 
ste\\'pan with boiling salted water to cover, allowing a teaspoon- 
ful of salt for a quart of water, and boil until tender. Young 
carrots will cook in 30 minutes and the water should be allowed 
to boil away. Old carrots require 45 minutes boiling. Drain 
well and add to the white sauce. Serves 6 to 8. 

CAULIFLOWER 

Soak cauliflower in cold salt water to draw out insects. Tie 
in cheese cloth to prevent falling to pieces, put into a large 
amount of boiling water and boil rapidly until tender (20-30 
min.) leaving kettle uncovered. 

Cauliflower au Gratin 

1 head cauliflower 1 cup milk or cream 

2 tablespoons butter or 1 teaspoon onion juice 

other fat. . 2 tablespoons grated cheese 

2 tablespoons flour Y^ cup bread crumbs 

^ teaspoon salt 1 tablespoon butter 

Dash of pepper 
Boil the cauliflower in salted water till tender, about 30 
minutes. Prepare a white sauce with 2 tablespoons butter, 
flour, salt, pepper, and milk. Add onion juice and cheese. 
Break cauliflower up in pieces, put in baking dish, cover with 
white sauce and sprinkle with buttered crumbs. Place in a 



20 



hot oven until the crumbs are a golden brown, about 20 
minutes. Serves 6 to 8. (See scalloped dishes). 

CELERY 

Separate the pieces of celery from the root and wash each 
piece thoroughly. Remove any discolored portions with a knife. 
Cut off the leaves and keep them for garnishing or for soup. 
Reserve coarse or broken pieces, leaves, and roots for cooking. 
Serve all the delicate, crisp pieces uncooked with salt or use 
them in salads. 

Creamed Celery 

3 stalks celery 1 recipe medium white sauce 

Wash and scrape the celery, cut in ^ inch pieces, cover 

with boiling water, and cook until tender (20-30 minutes), 

drain and serve with a white sauce, using the water in which 

the celery has been cooked as stock in the sauce. Serves 6. 

COLLARDS 

In those parts of the country where collards grow readily 
they are among the most valuable greens and give a much 
needed variety to the diet. They belong to the cabbage family 
and are valuable for their bulk and for the mineral matter they 
contain. 

After washing collards thoroughly, add to a large amount 
of rapidly boiling water, and boil for 15 or 20 minutes or 
until perfectly tender. Season with salt, pepper, and butter 
or serve with white sauce. 

CORN 

Green corn is a valuable table vegetable, both fresh and 
canned, because of its agreeable flavor and the cellulose which 
provides necessary bulk to the diet. 

Fresh corn should be used on the table or for canning as 



21 



early after gathering as possible. It should be kept in a cold, 
dry place until used because it contains fermentable juices and 
hence sours quickly. 

When it is to be used the husks and all the silky fibers 
should be carefully removed. The corn may be cooked on the 
cob or trimmed off with a sharp knife. If the corn is old, 
the kernels may be cut through with a sharp knife, then the 
pulp may be pressed out with the back of the knife and most 
of the hull left on the cob. 

Corn on the Cob 

After removing the husks and silk, trim the cobs if they 
have been unevenly developed or are imperfect in any way. 
Put into boiling salted water and after the water has came to a 
boil continue the boiling from 10 to 20 minutes. The corn is 
done as soon as the milk in the kernels has thickened. This 
can be tested by trying one kernel. If boiled for a long time 
the corn becomes hard and its flavor is impaired. Serve hot. 

Corn Pudding 

1 doz. ears fresh com or 1 teaspoon sugar 

1 can corn ^ teaspoon salt 

3 eggs 2 tablespoons flour 

2 cups rich milk 1 tablespoon softened butter 
Mix the dry ingredients, add to the well-beaten yolks of the 

eggs, corn and milk. Cut and fold in well-beaten whites of eggs 
and the butter. Bake in a buttered dish in a moderate oven y^ 
hour or till firm. Serves 6 to 8. 

Stewed Corn 

Cut the fresh corn from the cob, scraping as much pulp 
from the cob as possible. Season with salt and pepper, add a 
little milk and butter, and simmer a few minutes on top of the 
stove or in the oven. 



22 



Scalloped Corn 

1 quart fresh corn or ^ teaspoon pepper 

1 can of corn 3 tablespoons butter or 

^3 cup milk other fat 

1%. teaspoons salt. 2 cups stale bread crumbs 

After removing corn from the cob mix with milk, add 
seasonings and 1 tablespoon butter. 

Melt 2 tablespoons butter, add crumbs and line the bot- 
tom of a buttered baking dish with one-fourth of the amount. 
Then add one-half the corn mixture and one-fourth more of 
the crumbs. Add remainder of the corn and cover with but- 
tered crumbs. 

Bake in a moderate oven 20 to 30 minutes to brown 
nicely on top. Serves 6 to 8. (See scalloped dishes). 

COWPEAS 

Cowpeas should be cooked soon after gathering, in order 
to preserve their fine flavor. Cook the green cowpeas (in pod 
or shelled) in boiling salted water until tender. Season and 
serve. Dried cowpeas should be soaked over night (7 or 8 
hours), then boiled until tender. By absorbing water dried 
cowpeas increase in size until each cup makes nearly 2^ 
cups of cooked peas. 

CUCUMBERS 

Cucumbers are valued for their fresh, cool crispness, and 
are generally eaten raw. They are served with salt, pepper, 
vinegar and oil, or with salad dressing, alone or combined w^ith 
other vegetables. 

To Prepare Cucumbers 

Wash, pare, and cut thick slices from ends. Taste the 
cucumber to be sure it is not bitter. Keep very cold and slice 
thin just before using. The cucumber will be more crisp if 



23 



soaked in salt water. Serve as the salad accompanying meat or 
fish, and with potatoes or other starchy vegetables. 

EGGPLANT 

Eggplant has an agreeable flavor and adds to the variety 
of the diet, though its food value is not high. It should be served 
with meat and potatoes or with one of the more nutritious vege- 
tables, such as beans. 

Scalloped Eggplant 

1 eggplant 1 cup bread crumbs 

^2 small onion 3 tablespoons butter or 

5^2 teaspoon salt other fat 

Pepper 
Cut the eggplant in halves and cook in boiling salted water 
until tender. Drain carefully, remove the pulp from the shell 
and chop the pulp fine. Chop the onion and fry it in 2 table- 
spoons of the fat. Add onion and seasonings to the eggplant. 
Put into a well-greased dish and cover with buttered crumbs. 
Bake in a hot oven from 15 to 20 minutes until well browned 
on top. 

Boiled Eggplant 

Prepare as for scalloped eggplant, heat well after combin- 
ing with the seasoning, omit the buttered crumbs and serve 
without baking. 

Fried Eggplant 

Cut the eggplant in slices about % inch thick, and pare. 
Sprinkle the slices with salt and pile them one upon the other, 
then put a plate with a weight on top of the slices. Let them 
stand an hour, then remove weight and plate. Add 1 table- 
spoonful of water, half a tablespoonful salt, and one-fourth a 
teaspoonful pepper to an egg. Beat well. Dip the slices of 
eggplant into the egg, then into dried bread crumbs. Fry till 
brown. Drain on absorbent paper. 



24 



KALE 

Kale is used chiefly as greens, being boiled and seasoned 
much the same as cabbage. 

Kale Boiled with Pork 

Boil half a pound of salt pork gently for 3 or 4 hours. 
Pick kale over carefully, wash thoroughly, drain well, and put 
on to boil with the pork. Boil rapidly for 25 to 45 minutes. 
Serve the pork with the kale. Add more salt if necessary. 

Smoked bacon or ham may be substituted for the pork. 
Kale may also be cooked in water in which corned beef was 
boiled. 

Minced Kale 

Remove all the old or tough leaves. Wash the kale 
thoroughly and drain, then put on to cook in a kettle of boiling 
water, to which has been added salt in the proportion of 1 
tablespoon to 4 quarts of water. Boil rapidly, with the cover 
off the kettle, until the vegetable is tender. Pour off the water 
and chop the kale rather fine; then put back into the kettle and 
add 1 tablespoon of butter and 2 tablespoons of meat broth or 
w'ater for each pint of the minced vegetable. Add more salt 
if required. Cook for 10 minutes and serve at once. The time 
required for cooking kale varies from 30 to 50 minutes. If 
young and fresh from the garden it will cook in 30 minutes. 

KOHLRABI 

Kohl-rabi should be used when young and tender, while 
the leaves are not more than 2 or 3 inches in diameter. The 
leaves are used as greens, but the root is the better part. 

Boiled Kohl.Rabi 

Wash and pare the kohl-rabi, then cut in thin slices. Put 
into salted, boiling water and boil, with the cover partially off 
the saucepan, until the vegetable is tender. This will take 



25 



from 30 to 50 minutes. Pour off the water and season with 
butter, salt and pepper. 

Kohl-rabi may be boiled with pork in the same way as 
kale. The cold boiled vegetable may be served as a salad. 

LETTUCE 

Keep lettuce in a cold place until needed. Sometime 
before using the lettuce stand the stalks in cold water to 
freshen. If leaves seem badly withered lay them in cold water 
for half and hour or more before using. Do not let leaves re- 
main long in water for they will become darkened. 

Look the leaves over carefully and wash them thoroughly 
in several changes of water. Use a large quantity of water and 
lift leaves from one pan to the other so that the dirt will settle 
in bottom of the pan. Wash till the last water is clear. 

Dry the leaves by shaking and patting on a towel, wrap 
them in a dry towel, and place them on ice until time to serve. 

Lettuce should be served very cold and dressed with salt, 
pepper and vinegar, or with French Dressing. 

MUSTARD GREENS 

Follow the rule for cooking spinach, but add boiling 
water when the greens are put to cook, and drain well after 
cooking. 

OKRA 

Okra is much valued in the Southern States as a vege- 
table and especially for use in soups. Combined with chicken, 
okra forms the basis of the popular gumbo soup. It contains 
some carbohydrate and mineral matter but its food value is not 
high, for it contains a very large proportion of water. 

Boiled Okra 

Boil the young pods of okra in salted water until tender 



26 



(about 20 minutes), drain and season with butter, salt, and pep- 
per. Add cream if desired. 

ONIONS 

The onion is of value because of its agreeable flavor, its 
laxative properties, and because it contains antiscorbutic sub- 
stances. It can be used raw, alone, and in salads and sand- 
wiches, as well as cooked in a variety of ways. As a season- 
ing for other cooked dishes the onion is invaluable. 

Stewed Onions 

1 quart onions 2 tablespoons butter 

% cup milk 54 teaspoon salt 

White pepper 
Peel onions under cold water. Cook until tender in boiling 
water (45 to 60 minutes), changing the water at the end of 5 
minutes, and again in 10 minutes. Drain, add milk, butter, and 
pepper, cook 15 minutes, and just before serving add salt. 
Serves 6. 

Fried Onions 

Remove the outer skin from the onions and slice them 
evenly or chop fine. Fry in hot fat until slightly browned; 
stir carefully for they will brown unevenly. 

Scalloped Onions 

8 onions % teaspoon white pepper 

2 tablespoons butter 1 ^ cup milk 

3 tablespoons flour 1 cup bread crumbs 
^ teaspoon salt * 1 tablespoon butter 

Boil the onions till tender, changing water after 10 minutes, 
and again after second 10 minutes. When tender cut in slices, 
put into a buttered baking dish and pour over them a white 
sauce made of the butter, flour, salt, pepper, and milk. Cover 
with the buttered crumbs. Bake in a moderate oven until the 
crumbs are a golden brown, about 15 minutes. Serves 6 to 8. 
(See scalloped dishes). 



27 



Stuffed Onions 

6 large Bermuda onions Pepper 

6 tablespoons cooked meat ^ cup buttered bread crumbs 

(chopped) 1 tablespoon butter 

Yz teaspoon salt

out circular piece from top of each. Scoop out inside to form a 
cup. Chop one-half of the onion thus removed, add chopped 
meat, ^ cup soft bread crumbs, and seasonings. Fill onion 
cups with this mixture. Put in a baking pan and cover bottom 
of pan with boiling water. Bake 15 minutes, basting once or 
twice. Then cover tops with ^4 cup buttered crumbs and re- 
turn to oven to brown. Serve on circular pieces of toast. 
Serves 6. 

Pecans or other nuts may be substituted for the meat in 
stuffed onions. 

PARSNIPS 

Parsnips are among the most nutritious roots and can be 
kept for use throughout the winter and into the late spring until 
they begin to sprout. They are rich in sugar and contain a good 
proportion of mineral matter. They should be used with some 
food which supplies protein and with one of the fresh green 
vegetables. 

Boiled Parsnips 

Scrub parsnips thoroughly, boil till tender, plunge into cold 
water and remove the skins. Season with butter, salt, and pep- 
per. Reheat and serve.

tritious vegetables. To prepare fresh peas, shell and cook 
slowly with a small amount of boiling water, leaving the kettle 
uncovered so that the water will boil away at the last.- Season 
with salt, pepper, and butter, add milk or cream if desired, or 
serve with a white sauce.

and dry. Boil the rice separately, drain, and add to the cow 
peas. Season with salt and pepper. Serve hot. Serves 8 to 10. 

GREEN PEPPERS 

Sweet green peppers are prepared for the table by stuffing 



29 



and baking, or are used as a foundation for salad or as a season- 
ing in meat preparations, salads, soups, and sauces. 

When peppers are to be used they should -be well washed, 
tops removed, and all seeds and inner membrane discarded. 
Eaten uncooked they frequently cause acute attacks of indiges- 
tion, and their use in salads is not recommended. 

Stuffed Peppers

buttered crumbs. Place peppers in a baking pan and cover the 
bottom of the pan with boiling water. Bake in a moderate oven 
Yz hour. Serve with tops for lids. Serves 6 to 10. 

POTATOES 

If potatoes are kept in a cold, dark, dry place they last for 
months. Sprouts which come from the eyes of the potatoes 
should be picked off. Potatoes should be protected from freez- 
ing. 

Before using, potatoes should be well scrubbed. They are 
always better if cooked with their jackets on; if pared, the par- 
ing should be very thin. Scraping is sufficient for new potatoes. 

Potatoes must be cooked to soften the cellulose and to cook 
the starch. They are best boiled, baked, and steamed. Cold, 
left-over portions of potatoes may be made into attractive and 
palatable dishes. 

Potatoes should be served very hot, left uncovered to allow 



30 



the steam to escape, or covered with a napkin to absorb the 
steam. 

They may be garnished with parsley, or chopped pepper, or 
served with drawn butter sauce, white sauce, hot milk, gra\y, or 
hollandaise sauce. 

Potatoes should be accompanied with meat, fish, eggs, 
cheese, or other meat substitute when served. 

Baked Potatoes 

Scrub potatoes carefully and place in a baking pan. 
Bake in a hot oven 45 to 60 minutes. When soft, break 
the skin and let steam escape. Serve in an uncovered dish. 

Boiled Potatoes 

Wash and pare potatoes. Cover wath boiling water. Add 
salt. Boil slowly until tender (20 to 30 minutes), drain, shake 
gently, and dry at the back of the stove, leaving the saucepan 
uncovered, or lay a cloth folded over the top to absorb the mois- 
ture. 

If potatoes are to be boiled with their jackets on, follow 
the same directions for cooking omitting salt. Before serving, 
remove the skins carefully from the hot potatoes.

SALSIFY, OYSTER PLANT, OR VEGETABLE OYSTER 

Salsify is one of the vegetables of value throughout the 
winter. Its food value is not high, but it contains some pro- 
tein, carbohydrate, and mineral matter. Because of its delicate 
flavor it makes a pleasing addition to the diet. It can be used 
with meats and starchy vegetables. 

Boiled Salsify 

Wash, scrub, and scrape the oyster plant, putting it directly 
into cold water to which a little vinegar has been added to pre- 
vent turning dark. Cut in small pieces, cook in boiling, salted 
water until tender (45 to 60 minutes). Drain. Season with 
salt, pepper, and butter. 

Salsify Fritters 

Mash the boiled salsify, season with butter, salt, and 
pepper. Shape in small flat cakes, roll in flour and brown in 
hot fat. 

Creamed Salsify 

Prepare boiled salsify, cut in small pieces, and add to white 
sauce.

Spinach 

i^ peck spinach ^ teaspoon salt 

2 tablespoons butter or yg teaspoon pepper 

other fat 

Pick leaves from the stems and wash carefully to remove the 
sand. Cook uncovered without water until tender (about 30 
minutes) stirring frequently at first, then chop fine or press 
through a colander; reheat with butter and seasonings or add 
one recipe brown sauce. Serve garnished with 2 hard-cooked 
eggs if desired. Old spinach should be cooked in boiling water 
45 minutes. Serves 6 to 8. 

SQUASH 

Summer squash should be used while fresh. Hubbard or 
winter squash is good through the winter months. 

Summer squash, cushaw or crookneck squash, and cym- 
lings, should be washed, broken into pieces with a knife, and 
pared. Winter squash must be broken into pieces with a hatchet, 
and the shreds and seeds removed from the center. 

Baked Squash 

Wipe the outside shell of the squash, cut it in pieces for 
serving, remove seeds and stringy portion, place in a dripping 
pan, and bake in a slow oven until tender, about three-quarters 
of an hour. Serve at once. 

Steamed Squash 

Prepare squash as for baking, put in steamer over boiling 
water, and cook until soft about 30 minutes. Winter squash may 
require 40 minutes. Then scrape squash from shell, mash, and 
season with butter, salt, and pepper. If very watery it may be 
necessary to press out part of the juice by squeezing the pieces of 
squash between the colander and a plate. 



39 



SWISS CHARD 

The green, tender leaves of Swiss chard are cooked as 
spinach is cooked. \A'hen the leaves are full grown the midribs 
may be cooked and served with white sauce. 

TOMATOES 

Ripe tomatoes must be kept in a cold, dry place and very 
carefully handled or they will spoil easily. They are best if 
eaten soon after being gathered. If tomatoes are gathered before 
they are quite ripe, they can be kept much longer. They should 
be handled carefully, kept perfectly dry, and placed in the sun 
to ripen just before being used. Because of their juicy, acid 
nature, tomatoes should be served with meat, fish or dried beans, 
and with a starchy vegetable such as potatoes. 

Before serving, tomatoes should be washed carefully. They 
are nicest if the skins are removed. If tomatoes are well ripened 
the skin may be easily removed with the aid of a sharp paring 
knife. If the skins do not come off readily the tomatoes may 
be plunged for an instant in scalding hot water. All traces of 
core should be removed. 

If tomatoes are to be served raw, they should be washed, 
skinned (preferably without scalding), carefully freed from the 
core, and chilled. They are attractive served whole, cut in 
quarters, or sliced. They are palatable served with salt; w^ith 
salt and vinegar; with salt, vinegar, and salad oil; with cream 
and sugar; or with salad dressing. A few slices of cucumber 
may be served with the sliced tomatoes. The whole tomato may 
be slightly hollowed out and filled with salad dressing or with 
some salad preparation. 

Fried Tomatoes 

6 ripe tomatoes 2 cups dried bread crumbs 

2 eggs Fat for frying 

Select ripe tomatoes of uniform size. Wash thoroughly.

pulp, parsley, onion juice, and seasonings. Fill the tomatoes 
with the mixture, place them in a shallow dish and bake 15 
minutes in a hot oven. Serves 6. 

TURNIPS 

The turnip is a winter vegetable valuable in furnishing 
variety to the table. It has a heavy outer covering, hence must 
be pared with a thick paring. 

Creamed Turnips 

Scrub turnips. Pare with a deep paring. Boil till tender. 
Cut in dice and cover with a medium white sauce. 

Mashed Turnips 

6 turnips 1 teaspoon salt

were cooked. Beat them until very light, add butter, and 
salt and beat again, reheat and serve. Serves 6 to 8. 

MUSHROOMS 

Fresh mushrooms mux- 1>l' in season from the spring 
throughout the summer, but are most almndant in August. Those 
grown in the open air in meadows and shaded glens have the 
best flavor. They should not be used if they are over-ripe, if 



42 



tney have been attacked by slugs, if they have a disagreeable 
smell and taste, if they have a tough consistency, if they have 
been grown in dirty places, or if they soften easily. They are 
gathered and packed loosely in boxes or baskets for market. 
They are sometimes dried for storing but more frequently they 
are preserved by canning. They should always be perfectly 
fresh for use. The price of mushrooms varies greatly with the 
season and variety. 

Both the stem and the expanded top of the mushroom 
are used for food, but the stem is likely to be tough and is often 
only used for seasoning. Mushrooms are never eaten raw. 
They are cooked to soften them and to develop flavor. Before 
cooking they should be soaked in cold water to draw out the 
insects, then washed in cold water, the earthy stem cut off, and 
the skin peeled from the top of the cap. They may be broiled, 
sauted, baked, and boiled. They are used alone or as a season- 
ing for sauces, soups, and other dishes. 

The best flavor is developed if the mushrooms are first 
cooked in butter. The baked mushrooms are especially nice if 
covered with a glass bell so that none of the steam and flavors 
are lost. 

]Mushrooms are usually served with a rich sauce and are 
generally accompanied by toast or some other carbohydrate 
food. 

Mushrooms do not have a high food value but are prized 
for their flavor. 

To Prepare Fresh Mushrooms for Cooking 

Scrape the stems, cut off the ends. Peel the caps of the 
mushrooms. AA'ash them in salted water to remove the insects 
from the gills. Soak a few minutes in fresh cold w^ater. 
To Prepare Canned Mushrooms 

Pour the liquid from the mushrooms and put them in boil- 
ing water. Boil 3 minutes and drain.

SAUCES FOR VEGETABLES AND MEATS 

"Binding" or "Roux'' is the flour and fat cooked together 
for the thickening of a sauce. For white sauce and other 
sauces light in color the roux is not browned. For brown sauce, 
tomato sauce, and gravies brown roux is prepared. In "Brown 
Roux" the fat and flour are both browned in cooking, hence a 
larger per cent of flour is required than in white sauce. 
"Wetting" is the liquid used in the sauce. "Stock" is the term 
applied to water in which vegetables, meat, or fish have cooked. 
A few recipes for standard sauces are given. The recipe for 
Medium White Sauce can be regarded as a basis for developing 
other sauces. To increase the variety of sauces prepared, the 
fat, thickening, liquid, and seasonings may all be varied as 
indicated in the table below.

FRUITS 

The skins of fruit carry dirt and germs, therefore all fruits 
should be washed before using. Prepare fresh fruit just before 
cooking to preserve flavor and prevent discoloration. Use only 
silver knives when preparing fruit and silver or w^ooden spoons 
for stirring. 

Cook fruit in porcelain-lined or granite- ware kettles, never 
in tin. Cover with a china plate or granite-ware cover. Use 
a small quantity of water in stewing fruit. Boiling sugar with 
an acid reduces its sweetness, hence when fruits are cooked sugar 
should not be added until cooking is nearly done. 

Dried fruits need special preparation. Prunes," dried apri- 
cots, and dried peaches should be washed in several changes of 
water; dates and figs should be scalded; raisins and currants 
should be washed and carefully looked over; the skin of dried 
peaches should be removed after. soaking. After washing dried 
fruits, soak for several hours in enough cold water to cover, 
then cook slowly in the same water till tender.

of fruits can be used. 

Serve as an appetizer at the beginning of a meal. Serves 
6 to 8. 

Note — The juices of the fruit can be saved and utilized 
in flavoring fruit drinks or in making fruit ices or jellies. 



FOOD PRESERVATION 

The object of food preservation is to make fruits and vege- 
tables of value for a longer time than through their ripening: 
season. After ripening, fermentation and bacteriological changes 
take place so rapidly that the season for the usefulness of most 
fruits and of many vegetables is very limited unless some means 
is employed for their preservation. 

Chilling, canning, drying, and pickling are the methods of 
preservation most commonly employed. 

Chilling involves the keeping of foods at a very low tem- 
perature, a method which is only temporary but valuable and 
necessary both in the home and in the market. In cold, dry 
climates, chilling makes possible the keeping of many vegetables 
and some fruits throughout the winter without applying further 
means of preservation. 

Drying is accomplished by exposure to the sun or to arti- 
ficial heat. Drying is one of the oldest methods of food preser- 
vation and is valuable for many reasons. The dried food is 
light, compact, and easily handled; how^ever, foods lose much in 
freshness and flavor when dried and become dark in appearance 
and small in size. Drying is unpopular because of the long 
soaking required before foods can be used, and because the com- 
mercially dried foods have often been treated with sulphur in 
order to preserve their color. Improved methods of commercial 
drying and dehydrating are today increasing the popularity of 
dried foods and offer a helpful solution to the ever-increasing 
problem of the high cost of living. 

Canning is the method of preservation most generally em- 
ployed for both fruits and vegetables. Canning of meat is also 
sometimes desirable on the farm w^hen there are not means of 
keeping meat in hot w^eather, or when the feeding of poultry 
through the long winter season is not feasible. The thrifty 

54 



55 



housekeeper should be famihar with the most effective methods 
of canning in order to provide a varied diet for her family dur- 
ing the long season when fresh foods are not available. 

Principles of Canning 

Canning involves the destruction of all germs and spores 
by boiling or steaming the product, and the exclusion of all 
germs from the jar by completely sealing it. The destruction of 
germs in the food, on the jar and on everything that comes in 
contact with the food must be complete in order to secure success. 
Air-tight sealing of jars can be effected by using good tops and 
good, new, pliable rubbers, fitting them tightly. The best suc- 
cess in canning is usually obtained if small quantities of food 
are handled at a time. Small jars are preferable if the family 
is not large. 

Methods of Canning 

There are two methods of canning, known as the open-ket- 
tle method and the can-cooked, or cold-pack, method. The 
open-kettle method is more simple, but the can-cooked or cold- 
pack method can be used effectively with a larger number of 
foods. 

Open-Kettle Method of Canning 

In the open-kettle method the foods are brought to the 
boiling point in a kettle, boiled until thoroughly sterilized and 
tender, sweetened or seasoned as necessary, and then poured 
into sterilized jars, which must be sealed at once. This method 
requires but little time and a simple equipment will serve. It 
can be used to advantage with most fruits because it gives 
opportunity for evaporation of the water from watery fruits, for 
long boiling of such hard fruits as pears and quinces, and for 
the preparaton of jams, marmalades, and preserves. Because of 
the acids contained in fruits, they keep well when canned by this 
method. For this reason tomatoes can also be canned by the open- 



56 



kettle method, but other vegetables which do not contain so 
much acid will not keep. 

Cold-Pack Method of Canning 

In the can-cooked, or cold-pack, method the food is scalded 
or blanched in boiling water or steam, dipped into cold water, 
packed directly into the jars, and covered with boiling water, or 
with boiling syrup of the desired density, or with boiling fruit 
juice, usually sweetened. The covers are adjusted and the jars 
are placed on a rack in a large kettle and entirely surrounded 
by water, which should extend an inch over the top. The water 
should be quickly brought to the boiling point and boiled as long 
as is necessary to sterilize and cook the food which is contained 
in the jars. The can-cooked, or cold-pack, method can be used 
for fruits, vegetables, and meats. It offers little opportunity for 
spoilage because the jar and its contents are both thoroughly 
sterilized and the product canned retains its shape, color, and 
flavor well. The can-cooked, or cold-pack, method involves more 
labor and time on the part of the housewife and requires more 
fuel, but the excellent results that can be obtained when canning 
a considerable quantity of food are worth the additional labor 
and expense involved. 

For those vegetables which contain spores that are especially 
resistant to the heat, an intermittent process of sterilization is 
considered necessary in some parts of the country. When this 
method is used the vegetable is cooked in the can one hour or 
longer in the water bath on three or four successive days. At the 
end of each period of sterilization the jars are removed from 
the water bath. 

Processes in the Cold-Pack Method 

The three main processes necessary to success in the cold- 
pack method are blanching, dipping, and the sterilization, or 
processing, of the food which is being canned. 



57 



Blanching — Blanching consists in dipping the food into 
boiling water or live steam and leaving it immersed for from two 
to eight minutes according to the nature and the maturity of the 
food. (See time-table). Live steam is best for greens. Boiling 
water is desirable for other products. Berries and some soft 
fruits need not be blanched. The purpose of blanching is 
( 1 ) to prepare for the removal of the skin ; ( 2 ) to remove the 
strong flavor; (3) to eliminate objectionable acids; (4) to bring 
out the color; (5) to shrink the product, making possible a 
fuller pack; and (6) to make the product more flexible. 

Dipping — After blanching, the food should be cold-dipped : 
that is, it should be dipped quickly into water which is as cold 
as possible and it should be removed immediately. Fresh water 
should be used for each dipping. If possible, it is desirable to 
accomplish the dipping process by allowing the water to run 
through the food. The purpose of dipping is (1) to set or 
coagulate the coloring matter so that it does not dissolve so easily 
during the sterilization period; (2) to harden the pulp beneath 
the skin; and (3) to make the food easier to handle in packing. 

Sterilization — Sterilization, or processing, consists in boil- 
ing the packed jars in a boiler or canner full of water, for a 
designated length of time. (See time-table.) The jars should be 
placed on a wooden rack in a covered boiler, which is used as 
the canner. The canner should be filled with sufficient water to 
come over the top of the jars for at least one inch, thus forming a 
hot-water bath. The water should be boiling when the jars are 
put into the boiler. The jars should be in the lx)iler and the 
water about them should be kept at the l^oiling point long enough 
to make tender and to thoroughly sterilize the contents. Steriliza- 
tion, or processing, kills or renders ineffective the organisms 
within the jars which would cause the food to spoil.

1 Can only fresh, sound products. 

2 Sort, wash, and prepare the products. 

3 Blanch all green vegetables in steam; blanch all other 

vegetables and the hard and citrus fruits in boiling 
water. Do not blanch berries and other soft fruits. 

4 Dip the vegetables or fruits quickly into cold water and 

remove them immediately. 

5 Pack at once in clean, hot jars. 

6 Place scalded rubbers in position on the jars. 

7 Add y2 teaspoon of salt for each pint of vegetables. 

8 Fill jars of vegetables with boiling water; fill jars of 

fruit with hot syrup of density desired. Paddle 
out any air bubbles with a flat whittled stick one 
and one-half inches in width. 

9 Place cap in position. 

10 Partially tighten the tops of the glass jars by adjusting 

only the larger bail of the glass top jar, or by screw- 
ing the top of the Mason jar on completely, then 
turning it back one-fourth of a turn to loosen it. 

11 Place jars on the rack, lower them into the hot-water 

bath and boil 2 hours for greens; 1^^ hours for 
roots and tubers; 3 hours for beans; 5 hours for 
corn and peas; 16 minutes for berries and soft 
fruits; 20 minutes for hard fruits; and 30 minutes 
for fruits without sugar. Begin to count the time 
when the water begins to boil vigorously or jumps. 

12 Be sure that the lid of canner is provided with a small 

hole to allow for escape of steam. 

13 Remove the jars from the boiler at the end of the 



59 



sterilization, or processing, period and seal imme- 
diately. 

14 Invert the jars to test the seal. If not sealed properly. 

determine the cause, remedy it, and re-sterilize in 
the hot-water bath for 10 minutes. 

15 Cool as quickly as possible, avoiding drafts. 

16 Label, wrap, and store jars in a cool, dark place. A 

uniform system of labelling will add to the attrac- 
tiveness of canned goods. Use labels of one size 
for all jars. Print the name of food and year on 
each label. Place the labels 4 inches from bottom of 
quart jars, 2 inches from bottom of pint jars, and 
1^2 inches from bottom of jelly glasses. Put the 
labels on straight. 

Cautions to be Observed when canning by -the Cold-Pack 
Method 

1 Do not use old or decayed products. They will prob- 

ably spoil. 

2 Use one set of directions only and follow the time- 

table exactly. 

3 Can products as soon after gathering as possible, as 

fruits and vegetables deteriorate rapidh'. 

4 Test all jars, covers, wire bails, rubbers, etc., to see if 

in good condition, or much loss may occur. 

5 Never use rul)bers a second time. Jars, covers, etc., if 

in good condition, may be used from year to year. 

6 If wire bail or clamp does not go into position with a 

snap, remove it from jar and bend it so that it will 
be tighter. This is necessary for good results. 

7 Keep water as near the boiling point as possible during 

blanching and time accurately, then dip in and out 
of cold water quickly. Soaking ma}' ruin good ma- 
terial. 



60 



8 If possible, have jars stand in hot water while pack- 

ing, to prevent their breaking when put into boiling 
water to process. Place each jar immediately into 
the hot-water bath as soon as filled. 

9 Have water in the boiler at the boiling point when the 

jars are immersed, and do not begin counting the 
time until after the last jar has been placed in the 
hot-water bath and the water has once more reached 
the boiling point. Over-cooking is less harmful 
than under-cooking. 

10 If no provision has been made for the escape of steam 

from the canner there is danger of the lid blowing 
off while sterilization is in process. 

11 Do not have jars or containers close together while 

cooking; they are apt to crack if they touch one 
another. 

12 As soon as the product is sterilized, or processed, for the 

stated length of time, remove the jars from the 
water-bath and seal them immediately so as to ex- 
clude all air. Never open a jar to replenish water 
that has decreased through shrinkage of material. 
The fact that there has been an apparent loss of 
liquid during the sterilization period does not im.- 
pair the keeping quality. 

13 Do not place hot jars on cold metal, as they may break; 

place on a board some distance apart so they may 
cool as quickly as possible. 

14 Do not tighten the lids further after the product has 

cooled as the seal will thereby be broken and air 
may enter the jar. 

15 Examine the jars after they have cooled over night, and 

if any of them look suspicious open them, put 
into other containers, cover with fresh boiling 



61 



liquid, use new rubbers, and reprocess at once half 
as long as the original time. 
16 After labeling, store the jars in a cool, dark place. 
Wrapping jars with paper prevents fading of foods. 

Equipment Necessary for Cold-Pack Canning 

1 wash-boiler or lard can with a cover which has been punc- 
tured to allow for escape of steam. 

1 wooden rack or false bottom to fit in bottom of boiler or lard 
can and to raise the jars one inch from the bottom of the 
boiler and allow the water to circulate beneath. If possible 
the rack should be supplied with long wire handles so 
that it may be put in and lifted out with all the jars on it 
at once. There should be a rim around the edge of the rack 
so that the jars will not slip off when being immersed or 
lifted out. 

Fruit jars with covers 

Rubber to fit jars 

1 jar-lifter if the rack is not provided with handles 

1 wire basket or cheese cloth to use when blanching 

1 colander in which to wash soft fruits and to drain fruits and 
vegetables which have been dipped 

1 wide-mouthed funnel 

1 flat wooden paddle 1^^ inches wide 

Directions for Sterilizing Jars, Covers, and Rubbers 

Wash jars to which good covers have been fitted in hot 
soapy water and then rinse in clear hot water. Place a rack in 
the bottom of a dishpan or large kettle. Put 1 inch of cold 
water into the pan. Stand jars on the rack and put an inch of 
cold water in each jar. Put the covers on the rack beside the 
jars. Cover with a second dishpan. Bring the water slowly to 
boiling point and boil for at least 10 minutes. Remove only 



62 



one jar at a time when ready to fill. Never dry out the jar. Re- 
cover the dishpan each time a jar is removed. Keep water at the 
boiling point until all the jars needed have been used. Rubbers 
should not be sterilized with the jars, but should be placed in 
hot water off the stove about five minutes before using and re- 
moved one at a time as needed. 

CANNED VEGETABLES 

General directions for canning by the cold-pack method 
have already been given. The general rules should be followed, 
the cautions carefully observed with every recipe, and the time 
given for each process strictly adhered to.

Canned Asparagus (Cold-Pack Method) 

Select only young, tender asparagus. Can immediately. 
Grade as to size and wash carefully, removing large scales. 
Tie into bundles and plunge for 3 to 4 minutes into boiling 
water. Because the tips are more tender than the stalks, place 
lower ends in boiling water first; allow them to stand 2 or 3 
minutes; then immerse the whole bundle for 1 or 2 minutes 



63 



longer. Dip into cold water. Pack tips up, into jars which 
have been sterilized. Place rubbers in position. Fill jars 
with boiling brine (2 tablespoons salt to 1 quart of water). Put 
caps in position. Place in hot-water bath and sterilize 2 
hours. Remove from bath, seal, invert to test, wrap, mark, and 
store for future use. * 

Canned Beets (Cold-Pack Method) 
Grade the beets for size, color and degree of ripeness. Re- 
move tops, leaving at least one inch of stem on each beet. Wash 
thoroughly by using a vegetable brush, being careful not to 
break the skin, as that would cause loss of color. Cook in boil- 
ing water 10 minutes; plunge into cold water. Scrape to remove 
skin; pack whole, or in sections or cubes, into sterilized jars. 
Place rubbers in position. Add boiling water and 1 level tea- 
spoon of salt to each quart. Place tops in position and sterilize 
in hot-water bath 1}^ hours. Remove from canner and tighten 
tops. Invert to test, mark, wrap, and store for future use. 

Canned Carrots (Cold-Pack Method) 

Carrots used for canning should be young and tender and 
not more than 1^ inches in diameter. Wash and blanch in 
boiling water 8 minutes. Dip into cold water, remove skin. 
Cut into lengths, slices, dice, or leave whole. Pack into ster- 
ilized jars. Place rubbers in position. Cover with boiling 
water; add 1 teaspoon salt to each quart. Place covers in posi- 
tion. Put into hot-water bath and sterilize ll4 hours. Remove, 
seal tightly, and invert to test. Wrap in paper, mark, and store 
for future use. 

The canning of carrots is not advised unless they cannot be 
stored successfully in their natural state. 

Canned Corn (Cold-Pack Method) 

Remove the husks and silk from sound ears of sweet 
corn that have been freshlv slathered. Place in boiling water 



64 



for 3 minutes, then dip into cold water. Cut the corn from the 
cob and pack lightly to within an inch of the top of freshly- 
washed and scalded jars. Place rubbers on jars. To each 
quart add 1 teaspoon salt and 1 teaspoon sugar. Fill the jars 
w4th boiling water, being careful to break up any air bubbles. 
Put caps in position. Arrange the jars on a rack and immerse 
in boiling water in a boiler or other large container. Cover the 
boiler and bring the water to the boiling point. Boil 5 hours. 
If necessary to replenish water in boiler, add boiling water. 
Remove the cans from the boiler, seal tightly, invert to test, and 
mark, then store for winter use. 

Canned Corn (Intermittent Method) 

Remove the husks and silk from sound ears of sweet corn 
that have been freshly gathered. Place in boiling water for 3 
minutes, then dip into cold water for 1 minute. Cut the corn 
from the cob and pack lightly to wdthin an inch of the top of 
freshly washed and scalded jars. To each quart add 1 teaspoon 
salt and 1 teaspoon sugar. Fill the jars with boiling water, 
being careful to break up any air bubbles. Put the rubber and 
lid in position, but do not tighten the lid. Arrange the jars on a 
rack in a washboiler or other large container, surround with 
water, cover the boiler tightly and bring the water to the boiling 
point. Boil 15 minutes, then tighten the lids. Boil 1^ hours 
the first day. On the second and third days bring again to the 
boiling point and boil one hour each day. Remove the cans 
from the boiler, wipe them off, invert a few hours in order to 
discover leakage, and then store for winter use. 

Canned Eggplant 

Wash, peel, and slice sound eggplant. Blanch in boiling 
water for 5 minutes. Plunge quickly into cold water and pack 
carefully into sterilized jars. Place rubbers in position. Fill 
jars with boiling water. Add 1 teaspoon salt to every quart jar. 



65 



Put cap in position and sterilize in hot-water bath l^A hours. 
Remove jars. Seal, invert to test, mark, and store for future 
use. 

Canned eggplant may 1)e made into an attractive scalloped 
dish. 

Canned Greens (Cold-Pack Method) 

If it is not possible to secure fresh greens for the table all 
the year around, it may be feasible to can greens when they are 
abundant. Collards, swiss chard, kale, spinach, and beet tops 
may be satisfactorily canned. 

Can greens as soon after picking as possible. Sort and 
wash clean. Blanch by steaming in a steamer 15 to 20 minutes. 
Remove, plunge quickly into cold water; cut up slightly with 
a knife, and pack tightly into sterilized jars. Place rubbers 
and add 1 teaspoon salt to each quart of greens. Add boiling 
water to fill crevices. Break air bubbles wdth a wooden paddle. 
Place caps in position. Sterilize 2 hours in a hot-water bath. 
Remove from canner, tighten covers, invert to test, mark, wrap 
in paper to prevent bleaching. Store for future use. 

Canned Lima Beans (Cold-Pack Method) 

Follow the directions for canning peas, but allow 5 to 8 
minutes for blanching and sterilize 3 hours. 

Canned Okra (Cold-Pack Method) 

Young, tender pods of okra should be selected for canning. 
After it has been picked over and washed, remove the stems 
and blanch the pods in boiling water for 10 minutes, then dip 
into cold water. Drain. Pack into sterilized jars and add 1 tea- 
spoon salt to each quart. Place rubbers in position. Fill jars 
with boiling water. Place caps in position and arrange jars on 
a rack, immersing them in boiling water in a boiler. Cover and 



66 



boil for 3 hours. Remove jars from the boiler, seal, and invert 
to test. Mark and store. 

Canned Peas (Cold-Pack Method) 

Can peas within a few hours of picking. Cull, shell, and 
grade the peas. Put in cheese cloth and plunge into boiling 
water for 2 to 5 minutes according to size. Remove and plunge 
quickly into cold water. Fill sterilized jars. Place rubbers 
in position. Add a level teaspoon of salt to each quart. Fill 
the jar with boiling water; break up air bubbles with a wooden 
paddle. Place caps in position. Place in hot-water bath and 
sterilize 5 hours. Remove jars, tighten covers, and invert to 
test. Cool, mark, wrap jars in paper, and store for future use. 

Sauerkraut 

Select solid heads of cabbage, look over carefully, remove 
the outside leaves, and cut into quarters, removing the core. Cut 
cabbage into fine shreds with a sharp knife or slaw-cutter. 
Put a layer of cabbage 5 inches in depth into a five-gallon stone 
crock, and sprinkle with salt, using 2 pounds salt to 100 
pounds cabbage ( about 2 bushels). One bushel of cabbage will 
make between 3 and 4 gallons of kraut. Add another five-inch 
layer of cabbage and sprinkle with salt. Stamp each time until 
brine appears. When last portion of cabbage and salt has 
been added and stamped, and brine appears well over the top, 
cover the top with a clean cloth and a plate or board to fit tightly 
into the crock. Weight cabbage down by placing a heavy weight 
on the plate, being careful not to use sandstone or limestone, as 
acid is apt to attack them. A gallon jug filled with water 
makes a good weight. Leave cabbage in a temperature of from 
60 to 70 degrees for about 2 weeks. Remove the white foam 
which daily rises to the top. Care must be taken that the 
cabbage is always covered with brine, adding more brine as 
necessary. When the brine has developed an acid taste it is 



67 

ready for use. If it cannot be successfully kept in the crock, it 
may be stored in sealed jars. Pack the kraut into sterilized 
jars; place rubbers in position; fill jars with boiling water, 
place caps in position, and process 30 minutes in a hot- water 
bath. Remove jars, seal, mark, and store. 

If the kraut is to be made in a wooden keg instead of in a 
stone crock, the keg should be lined with clean, outside cabbage 
leaves to protect the kraut from the taste of the keg. 

Canned String Beans (Cold-Pack Method) 

Wash and string the green beans which have been freshly 
gathered. Plunge into boiling water 5 to 8 minutes according 
to size, and then plunge into cold water quickly. Drain. Pack 
into clean scalded jars and add 1 teaspoon salt to each quart 
jar. Place rubber in position and fill jar with boiling water, 
being careful to break any air bubbles. Place cap in position. 
Arrange the jars on a rack, immerse in boiling water in a wash- 
boiler, or other large container, cover the boiler, and bring the 
water to the boiling point. Boil 3 hours. Remove the jars 
from the boiler, tighten the tops, and invert to test. Mark, 
then store for winter use. 

Canned String Beans or Peas(Interniittent Method) 

Wash and string the green beans or shell the peas which 
have been freshly gathered. Plunge into boiling water for 10 or 
15 minutes, and then dip in cold water for 3 minutes. Pack 
into clean scalded jars and add 1 teaspoon salt and 1 tablespoon 
of vinegar to each quart jar. Place the rubber and lid in posi- 
tion. Arrange the jars on a rack in a washboiler or other large 
container, surround with water, cover tightly, and bring the 
water to the boiling point. Boil 15 minutes and tighten the lids. 
Boil 1^ hours the first day. On the second, third and fourth 
days, bring to the boiling point and boil 1 hour each day. On 
the fourth day remove the jars from the boiler, wipe them off 



68 



and invert them a few hours in order to discover leakage. Then 
store for winter use. 

Canned Sweet Potatoes (Cold Pack Method) 

Follow the recipe for canned carrots. 

The canning of sweet potatoes is not recommended unless 
they cannot be stored successfully in their natural state. 

Canned Tomatoes (Cold-Pack Method) 

Select ripe, sound tomatoes uniform in size. Can soon af- 
ter being picked. Wash, put in a wire basket, and lower into 
boiling water for 1 minute. Remove at once to prevent soften- 
ing. Plunge into cold water to make firmer. Peel immediately. 
Cut out cores with a pointed paring knife, being careful not to 
cut into the seeds. Pack tomatoes whole or in large pieces in 
sterilized jars; add 1 teaspoon each of sugar and salt to every 
quart of tomatoes. Place rubbers in position; fill jars with 
boiling water. Break up any air bubbles with a wooden paddle. 
Place caps in position. Immerse filled jars in a hot water bath 
and sterilize 22 minutes. Remove jars and seal. Invert to 
test, mark, wrap in paper, and store for future use. 

Canned Tomatoes (Open-Kettle Method) 

It is often desirable to can a few tomatoes at a time and for 
this purpose the housewife may desire to make use of the open- 
kettle method. Tomotoes may be satisfactorily canned in this 
way if all precautions concerning the sterilization of the cans 
and utensils used in the work are carefully observed. 

Select sound, ripe tomatoes. Scald and peel the tomatoes, 
cut in pieces, and boil gently, adding little or no water, for 
thirty minutes. Add 1 teaspoon salt for every quart of tomatoes. 
Put a rubber on a sterilized jar. Pour the tomatoes into the 
jar, filling the jar full; place lid in position and immediately 
tighten the lid completely. Invert the jars to detect any leakage. 
When cool mark the jars, wrap, and store in a dark place.

PICKLES AND OTHER RELISHES 

Bacteria do not grow in substances that contain a large 
amount of acid; hence there is little danger of those pickles 
spoiling that have been prepared with a large amount of vinegar. 
Cloves, cinnamon, mustard, and other spices also retard the 
growth of bacteria, hence they aid in the preservation of pickles 
and spiced foods. It is not necessary to process pickles. 

A variety of recipes for pickles and relishes are given be- 
cause of the great diversity of taste in the choice of pickles. A 
relish which one family enjoys may very seldom appear on the 
table in another home. 

Apple Chutney (Open-Kettle Method) 

12 sour apples 1 C{uart cider vinegar 

1 medium-size onion 1 cup currant or plum jelly 

2 green peppers 2 cups sugar 

1 red pepper 1 tablespoon salt 

1 cup raisins 1 tablespoon ground ginger 

4 lemons (juice) ^4 teaspoon cayenne pepper 

Pare and core the apples. Peel the onion; remove seeds 
and stems from peppers; chop apples, onion, peppers, and rai- 
sins very fine. Add the juice of the lemons, 1 pint of the cider 
vinegar, and the currant or plum jelly. Let simmer very gently 
for 1 hour, stirring frequently. Then add remainder of vinegar, 
the sugar, salt, ginger, and pepper. Cook 1 hour more, stirring 
constantly. Put into sterilized jars and seal, mark, and store. 
Use for an accompaniment to cold meats or for salad on head 
lettuce. 

Chili Sauce (Open-Kettle Method) 

12 medium-sized ripe to- 1 tablesi)oon salt 

matoes 2 teaspoons ground cloves 

1 pepper, finely chopped 2 teaspoons ground cinna- 

1 onion, finely chopped mon 

2 cups vinegar 2 teaspoons ground allspice 

3 tablespoons sugar 2 teaspoons grated nutmeg - 



70 



Scald, peel, and slice the tomatoes. Put into a kettle with 
remaining ingredients, bring gradually to the boiling point, and 
cook slowly 2y2 hours. Put into sterilized bottles or jars. Seal. 
If corked bottles are used, dip necks into bottle wax or paraffin. 
Mark and store. Serve with meat and fish. 

Chow Chow 

]/> bushel green tomatoes 2 tablespoons cinnamon 

1 dozen onions 1 tablespoon allspice 

1 dozen green peppers 1 tablespoon cloves 
Vinegar 1 tablespoon peppercorns 
Salt y2 cup ground mustard 

2 pounds sugar 1 pint horseradish 

Chop the vegetables fine, sprinkle with salt and let stand 
over night. In the morning drain well, then add vinegar to 
cover, and cook slowly 1 hour ; drain again and pack closely in a 
jar. 

Mix the sugar, cinnamon, allspice, cloves, peppercorns, 
ground mustard, and horse-radish with enough vinegar to cover 
well, then when boiling hot pour it over the mixture in the jar 
and cover tightly. 

Cucumber Pickles (Open-Kettle Method)

gar, water, alum, and sugar into a kettle. Add the cucumbers 
and onions. Heat slowly until scalded, but do not boil. When 
finished the pickles should be crisp. Boiling will soften them, 
hence follow directions closely. Remove pickles at once, pack 
into jars, and discard the liquid. Make a fresh vinegar solution 
with the same quantities of vinegar, water, alum, and sugar, add 



71 



the mustard seed, and let come to the boiling point. Pour the 
boiling liquid over the pickles in the jars. Seal, mark, and store. 

Dixie Relish (Cold-Pack Method)

gallon of water) for 24 hours. Freshen in clear, cold water for 1 
to 2 hours. Drain well. Remove the seeds and the coarse white 
section. Chop separately and measure the chopped cabbage, 
onions, and peppers, before mixing. Add spices, sugar, and 
vinegar. Let stand over night in a covered crock or enamel 
dish. Use for filling stuffed peppers or pack into small, steril- 
ized jars. Place rubber and cap in position. Sterilize 15 minutes 
in hot water bath. Seal, invert to test, mark, wrap, and store 
for future use. 

Green-Tomato Pickles (Open-Kettle Method) 

1 peck green tomatoes, sliced 1 cup salt 

6 large onions, sliced 1 quart vinegar 

Wash and slice the green tomatoes and onions and let them

broken. Put the apples into a sterilized jar and cover with the 
boiling syrup. Seal at once. Test, mark, and store. 

Pickled Beets (Open-Kettle Method) 

Wash beets well, leaving one inch of stem on each beet. 
Cook in boiling water until the beets are soft when pressed with 
a fork — about 2 hours (this is dependent upon the size of the 
beets). After beets have been boiled, dip into cold water, skin, 
and slice. Make a thin syrup, using i^ gallon vinegar, 2 cups 
sugar, 2V3 tablespoons salt, and 'A teaspoon pepper for each 
peck of beets. Put sliced beets into the boiling vinegar and cook 
5 minutes. Put into sterilized jars, fill with hot liquid, and seal.

Pick over, wash, and sort the onions. Peel and cover with 
water; let stand in a cool place for two days; change the water 
on the second day. On the third day wash the onions well, and 
put them into a brine made of salt and water, for four days, 
keeping as cool as possible. At the same time prepare a spiced 



73 



vinegar with the remaining ingredients. Tie the spices in a 
cheese-cloth bag, leaving them in the vinegar for four days. 
Change the brine on the onions on the second day. On the fourth 
day take onions out of the brine and put into boiling water; let 
stand 10 minutes; then put into cold water for 2 hours. Drain 
and pack the onions into small jars, adding the small red pep- 
pers or slices of red and green peppers. Fill the jars to over- 
flowing with the spiced vinegar. This amount will make about 
6 pints. Seal, mark and store. 

Pickled Peaches 

8 pounds peaches 4 pounds sugar 

2 or 3 cloves in each 1 pint vinegar 

Wash the peaches, but do not peel them. Remove the buds 
from the ends of the cloves and insert 2 or S cloves in each 
peach. Boil peaches in a syrup made of the sugar and vinegar 
until tender, drain off the syrup and put peaches on platters over 
night. Set the syrup aside to cool. The next day put the cold 
peaches into sterilized jars and pour the cold syrup over them. 
Seal, mark, and store. 

Pickled Pears 

Follow the recipe for pickled apples. 

Sliced Cucumber Pickles (Open Kettle Method) 

1 dozen cucumbers 
1 dozen onions 
3/8 cup salt 
Cucumbers about 2 inches in diameter and 4 inches long 
are best to use. Slice the cucumbers and onions in "A inch 
pieces, add salt, and let stand two hours; drain. Boil the fol- 
lowing ingredients: — 

1 cup sugar 1 teaspoon mustard seed 

1 cup vinegar 1 teaspoon cassia buds or 

1 teaspoon celery seed stick cinnamon 



74 



Add drained cucumbers and onions to this hot liquid and 
boil 15 minutes. Put into sterilized jars and seal. Mark and 
store. 

Spiced Pears 

7 pounds pears 8 whole cloves 

3 pounds sugar 8 whole allspice 

1 pint vinegar 2 sticks cinnamon 

^ lemon rind i/^ ounce ginger root 

Cut the pears in half, remove the seeds and pare. Put the 
vinegar and sugar on to boil. Into each piece of pear stick 
three or four cloves. Divide the cinnamon, allspice, and ginger 
in two parts, put into small pieces of cheesecloth, tie tightly, 
and then throw them into the sugar and vinegar. When the 
mixture begins to simmer, add the pears and lemon rind, bring 
all to boiling point, take from the fire, and turn carefully into 
a stone jar. Stand in a cool place over night. Next day drain 
all the syrup from the pears into a porcelain-lined or agate 
kettle, cook over a moderate fire, and when boiling hot pour it 
back into the jar over the pears. Next day drain and heat 
again as before; do this for five consecutive days. The last 
day boil the syrup down until there is just enough to cover 
the fruit. Add the fruit to the hot syrup, bring the whole to a 
boil, and put in stone or glass jars, or tumblers. The pears 
may be finished in one day, by taking out the fruit and cooking 
the syrup slowly down to the right amount, adding the fruit to 
reheat it, and finishing as above. The fruit is less rich if 
done this way. 

Spiced Prunes (Open-Kettle Method) 

1 pound prunes ^ ounce whole cloves 

1 pint vinegar 1 ounce stick cinnamon 

2 cups sugar 

Wash the prunes well and soak in cold water 12 hours, 
pour the water off. Make a syrup of vinegar and sugar, and add 



75 



spices tied in a small piece of cheese-cloth. Add the prunes 
to syrup and simmer slowly until very tender. Pack in sterilized 
jars. Cover with boiling s\Tup. Seal, mark, and store. 

Stuffed Peppers (Cold-Pack Method) 

Soak sweet peppers in ])rine (1 cup salt to 1 gallon of 
water) for 24 hours. When ready to stuff, take them from the 
brine, rinse in fresh water, carefully cut a circle off the top of 
each pepper, and save to be placed on peppers after stuffing. 
Remove seeds and white sections and soak peppers in clear water 
1 or 2 hours; drain carefully. Fill the peppers with Dixie Relish 
being careful not to press it in too tightly. Place the tops on 
the peppers and make each secure by one or two stitches of 
thread, or keep in place by fastening with two or three wooden 
tooth picks. Pack as many stuffed peppers as can be placed in 
a jar without crushing them. Fill jar with spiced vinegar. 
Process 15 minutes in hot-water bath. Remove, seal, invert to 
test, wrap, and store for future use. 

Tomato Ketchup (Open-Kettle Method) 

1 2 ripe tomatoes 2 tablespoons ginger 

2 large onions 1 tablespoon cinnamon 

4 green peppers 1 tablespoon mustard 

2 tablespoons salt 1 nutmeg (grated) 

4 tablespoons brown sugar 1 quart vinegar 

Peel the tomatoes and onions. Chop the onions and peppers 
fine. Boil all the ingredients together slowly for 3 hours, or 
until very soft, stirring frequently. Strain and reheat. Pour 
into sterilized bottles, cork, and seal immediately with bottle wax 
or paraffin. Mark and store. Serve with meat and fish. 
Tomato Relish (Uncooked) 

1 peck ripe tomatoes )/ cup mustard seed 

1 cup salt 2 cups sugar 

2 cups chopped celery 1 teaspoon cinnamon 
2 cups chopped onions 1 teaspoon cloves 

6 red peppers, chopped fine 1 Cjuart vinegar 



76 



Scald and skin the tomatoes and cut them in dice. Add 
the salt to the tomatoes and let them stand over ni^ht. Drain 
thoroughly. Add the remaining ingredients. Mix well. Put 
into sterilized jars and seal. Mark and store. 

Watermelon-Rind Pickles 

1 medium watermelon rind % cup cassia buds 

3 pounds sugar 4 pieces ginger root 

1 pint vinegar 
Cut the watermelon rind into strips three inches long 
and one inch wide. Peel and remove all pink part. Steam over 
boiling water till the watermelon can be pierced with a fork. 
Boil the sugar and vinegar to a hea\y syrup. Add the cassia 
buds, ginger root, and watermelon. Cook slowly until the water- 
melon rind is transparent. Pack into small sterilized jars. This 
recipe will make 6 pints. Seal, mark, and store. 

CANNED MEATS 
Canned Beef or Pork (Cold-Pack Method) 

Fresh meat may be kept indefinitely by canning according 
to the following directions: — 

Cut meat into pieces about 3 or 4 inches square, removing 
all bones. Dust lightly with a mixture of salt and pepper. Pack 
tightly into sterilized jars and see that there are several fat 
pieces on top. Place rubbers on jars and put caps in place. Boil 
steadily in a hot-water bath for 4 hours. When done, remove 
from bath, tighten lids, and invert to test. When moderately 
cooled, dip tops into paraffin. The next day the meat may have 
settled to about three-fourths the jar content and it should have 
a thick coating of fat on top. Mark the jars, wrap in paper, and 
put in a dark place. When ready to use, set the jar in a pan of 
hot water, and the meat will come out more readily. 



77 



Canned Chicken (Cold-Pack Method) 

Cook the chicken till tender in hot water, adding 1 table- 
spoon salt after the chicken has cooked 15 minutes. Remove 
the bones, pack meat into jars, and follow directions as for 
canned beef. 

CANNED FRUITS 

Almost all fruits give satisfactory results when canned, 
and the thrifty housewife will have a large number of jars of 
canned fruits on the pantry shelves. General directions for 
canning must be observed and can be applied to local fruits not 
named in the tables and recipes. 

A fruit is preserved in more nearly its natural condition if 
the cold-pack .method is followed, but the open-kettle method 
can be satisfactorily employed with most fruits. 

The thickness of the syrup may be varied according to the 
acidity of the fruit — 1 cup of sugar to 3 cups of water for a 
very sweet syrup, 1 cup of sugar to 5 cups of water for a thin 
syrup. A^'hen sugar is scarce the amount used may be reduced 
to 1 cup of sugar to 9 cups of water and the fruit will still ])e 
found sufficiently sweet to be palatable. 

The sugar used in canning serves only to sweeten the 
fruit and to bring out its flavor. When used in proportions for 
canning, it does not form a sufficiently dense syrup to aid in 
the preservation of the fruit, as it does in preserves, jams, and 
marmalades. Therefore fruits can be canned without sugar 
and will keep indefinitely if the principles of sterilization are 
strictly observed. However, an additional amount of labor is 
involved when the sugar must be added at the time of serving 
the fruit, and most housekeepers prefer to have the fruit sweet- 
ened for serving when it is canned unless sugar is scarce or its 
price prohibitive. 



78 



Sugar Substitutes to be Used in Canning 

Because of the increased price of sugar and the frequent 
shortage of supply, it is sometimes desirable to substitute other 
sweetening substances when canning fruits. Corn syrup, glu- 
cose, honey, maple syrup, molasses, and sorghum may be used 
in place of part or of all of the sugar in canning. With the 
exception of honey, the syrups are less sweet than sugar; there- 
fore, more syrup will be required to secure the same degree of 
sweetness. However, it is not necessary to use so large an amount 
of sugar as many recipes give, and it would be well if a taste 
for foods that are less sweet should be acquired. 

For canned fruits, syrups may be entirely substituted for 
sugar. For preserves and marmalades at least twenty-five per 
cent of sugar should be used in combination with the syrup. In 
jellies it is desirable to use at least fifty per cent of sugar with 
the syrup substituted.

JELLY MAKING 



The art of preparing jellies from the juice of fruits is one 
in which every housewife is eager to perfect herself. One can 
point with justifiable pride to the shelf of well-made jellies 
that are going to increase the attractiveness of the family table 
and add to the palatability of a diet which might otherwise be 
monotonously simple. A few fundamental principles must be 
borne in mind if one is to become expert in jelly making. 

ESSENTIALS TO JELLY MAKING 

Pectin, the jelly-making property of fruits — The substance 
in fruit juice that causes the juice to thicken and form a jelly 
after it has cooked is called pectin. This substance is present 
in different quantities in various fruits; hence some fruits can 
readily be made into a jelly, while a jelly cannot be successfully 
made from other fruits. The amount of pectin varies at dif- 
ferent stages of ripeness of the fruit. Pectin is present in 
largest quantity in fruits that are slightly under ripe. Over- 
ripe fruits contain less pectin. Pectin is found near the skin 
or around the core of fruit ; hence clean parings and sound cores 
should be cooked with the fruit when making jellies. 

Acid necessary in making jelly — In addition to pectin, it 
is necessary that fruits contain acid or that acid be added to 
the fruit juice when jelly is being made. Most fruits which are 
good for jelly-making contain sufficient acid, but occasionally 
quinces and berries do not have sufficient acid present. If the 
juice of these fruits is then combined with the juice of apples or 
other tart fruit, they can be made into good jellies. 

Sugar in jellies — While sugar is not necessary to the solidi- 
fying of fruit juice, it is necessary to add sugar to render the 
jelly palatable. The amount of sugar may be varied within 
certain limits according to the flavor of the fruit. The quantity 



83 



of sugar used will vary from one-half as much sugar as juice to 
equal parts of sugar and juice. More sugar than juice is apt 
to interfere with the formation of the jelly and a syrupy sub- 
stance result. 

Cooking the jelly — The juice is best extracted from the fruit 
by cooking. With soft fruits practically no water needs be 
added. With apples and quinces it is necessary to cover the 
fruit with water in order that the pectin may be drawn out. 
After the fruit has been cooked sufficiently to soften the pulp and 
draw out the juices, it should be strained through a flannel or 
muslin bag or a bag made of two thicknesses of cheese-cloth. 
Two or three hours will be sufficient time to allow for straining, 
then the juice should be reheated. If much water has been added 
when extracting the juice, or if the fruit contains much water, it 
should be boiled for fifteen or twenty minutes to evaporate excess 
of water before adding the sugar. After the sugar has been 
added, it should not be necessary to cook the juice more than 
eight or ten minutes before the jellying point is reached. The 
best jelly results when only a small amount of juice is cooked 
at one time (not more than 3 cups). 

Test for jelly — The juice is ready to form a jelly when it 
begins to sheet from the spoon, that is, when the spoon is dipped 
into the jelly and raised above it two drops will come from the 
edge of the spoon at the same time. The jelly should then be 
quickly removed from the fire and poured into sterilized glasses. 

Fruit best for jelly making — The fruits which make tlie 
best jellies are apples, crab-apples, quinces, green grapes, red 
currants, plums, gooseberries, and firm, hard berries such as 
blackberries, dewberries, and logan berries. These same fruits 
do not make a good jelly if they are not sour; therefore it is 
often necessary to combine one fruit with another fruit that 
contains more acid. 



84 



To Make Jelly 

Pick the fruit over carefully and wash it thoroughly. Re- 
move any decayed or imperfect portions, but do not discard the 
skins and sound cores because of the presence of pectin in those 
portions. Cut up large fruits and, if hard, add sufficient water 
to cover them. No water need be added to soft fruits. Cook 
the fruit until tender. Pour into a jelly bag and strain. Reheat 
the strained juice, boiling it long enough to evaporate any excess 
of water (15 to 20 minutes), then add the sugar, and cook from 
8 to 10 minutes longer. Test (see test for jelly). Remove from 
the fire and pour into sterilized jelly glasses. When cold cover 
with a thin sheet of melted paraffin, then put the tin top over 
the jelly glass or draw a clean paper neatly over the top. Lal^el 
the jelly glass neatly with the name of the fruit and the date. 
When jelly is used, paraffin may be washed and reserved for use 
another time. 

Canned Fruit Juice for Jelly Making 

\Mien sugar is scarce or high in price, the juice of fruit 
may be extracted as for jelly and canned for winter use. Fill 
sterilized jars with the boiling juice. Place rubbers and caps in 
position. Sterilize in hot-water bath 15 minutes. Remove 
from boiler. Seal, invert to test, mark and store. 

When ready to use as jelly, the jars can be opened, the 
juice reheated, sugar added, and jelly made in the usual man- 
ner. Many housewives prefer to prepare their jellies fresh in this 
way throughout the winter. 

Apple Jelly 

4 quarts apples 2 quarts water for fall apples 

1 pound sugar to or 

1 quart juice 3 quarts water for winter 

apples 
Cook the apples till soft but not mealy. Pour into flannel 



85 



bag. Press lightly, but not to make the pulp come through. 
Boil the juice 20 minutes. Stir in the sugar quickly, dissolve, 
strain the jelly again. Boil until two drops come from the spoon 
at the same time in two different places. Pour into sterilized 
glasses. When cool, cover with a thin layer of melted paraffin 
and a tin or paper cover. Label and store. 

Blackberry Jelly 

Follow the recipe for dewberry jelly. 

Crab-Apple Jelly 

Remove the blossoms and all decayed portions from the 
fruit; if large, cut into pieces, but do not pare or remove the 
seeds. Cover with cold water. Cook until the crab-apples are 
soft. Drain, first in a colander, then in a jelly bag. Use the 
juice only and do not press the bag except for a second-grade 
jelly. To 1 cup of juice, use ^ cup sugar. Boil the juice slowly 
for 15 minutes; add the sugar and boil for 5 minutes, skimming 
as often as necessary. Test. Pour into jelly glasses and when 
hard cover wdth melted paraffin. Put a tin cover over the glass, 
mark, and store. 

, Currant Jelly 

Follow recipe for grape jelly. 

Dewberry Jelly 

Wash berries by placing them in a strainer or colander and 
pouring water gently through them. Crush and let berries 
simmer 5 to 10 minutes to extract juice. Pour into a jelly bag 
and let drain into an open crock. Cook a small quantit}* at a 
time. When juice comes to the boiling point, add sugar, using 
^ cup sugar to every cup of juice. Cook until two drops come 
from a spoon in two different places at the same time. Remove 
from fire at once and pour into sterilized jelly glasses. Cool 
jelly in the sun if possible, as this gives a clearer |)roduct. 



86 



When cool, cover with a thin layer of paraffin and a tin cover 
or paper to protect jar from dust. Mark and store. 

Grape Jelly 

Pick grapes when under ripe. Remove from stems, pick- 
ing them over carefully. Wash by placing in a strainer or 
colander, pouring water gently through them. Crush and sim- 
mer grapes 5 to 10 minutes to extract juice. Pour into a jelly 
bag and let drain into an open crock. Measure and use 1 cup 
of sugar to each cup of juice, adding the sugar after the juice 
has begun to boil. Cook rapidly until two drops come from 
the spoon in two different places at the same time. Remove from 
fire at once and pour into sterilized jelly glasses. When cool, 
cover with a thin layer of paraffin and a tin cover or paper to 
protect jar from dust. Mark and store. 

Loganberry Jelly 

Follow the recipe for dewberry jelly. 

Plum Jelly 

Pick over and wash the plums well, removing the stems. 
Put into a kettle and add just enough water to keep from burn- 
ing, 1 inch of water to 5 inches of fruit. After the»skins have 
burst and the plums are tender, strain through a jelly bag. Boil 
the juice with "A cup sugar for every cup of juice, adding the 
sugar after the juice has begun to boil. Cook rapidly until two 
drops come from the spoon in two different places at the same 
time. Remove from fire at once and pour into sterilized jelly 
glasses. \Mien cool, cover with a thin layer of paraffin and a 
tin cover or paper to protect jar from dust. Mark and store. 

Plum Preserves 

After the first extraction of juice from the plums in making 
plum jelly, the pulp may be reserved for preserves. When it is 
cool enough to handle, remove the seeds, add an equal portion of 



87 



sugar, and cook to proper consistency for plum preserves. Pour 
into sterilized glasses. When cool, cover with a thin layer of 
melted paraffin. Cover to protect from dust. Mark and store. 

Quince Jelly 

Follow the recipe for apple jelly. If the quinces are not 
very sour, combine with tart apples when making jelly. Use 
equal quantities of quince and apple. 

JAMS, MARMALADES, AND PRESERVES 

Jams, marmalades, and preserves are canned by the open- 
kettle method, because it is necessary to cook them long and 
slowly with a large amount of sugar in order to evaporate the 
water and secure the density desired. Bacteria do not grow 
readily in a dense syrup, hence jams, marmalades, and pre- 
serves do not spoil readily, and it is not necessary to process 
them. 

Apple Butter 

A good apple butter may be made from the pulp that is 
left after extracting the juice from apples or crab apples when 
making jelly, if some juice remains in the pulp. Put the pulp 
through a colander to remove skins and seeds. Weigh pulp and 
use the following amounts of sugar and ground spices to every 
5 pounds of apple pulp: 2 pounds sugar, ^ tablespoon allspice, 
^ tablespoon cinnamon, 1 tablespoon cloves. Add sugar and 
spices to pulp and cook until of desired thickness. Stir fre- 
quently to prevent burning. Test on a cold saucer. The out- 
side surface of the portion tested should show a slight sheen 
upon standing. Pour into sterilized jars or jelly glasses. When 
cool, cover with paraffin, mark, and store. 

Apricot Marmalade 

Pick over the apricots. Plunge them in hot water for 2 
minutes, remove skins, cut the apricots in halves, and remove 



88 



the stones. AA'eigh the fruit and allow V,i of the weight in sugar. 
]\Iix the fruit and sugar and let stand over night to dissolve the 
sugar. In the morning bring to the boiling point and boil 20 to 
30 minutes. When the juice shows a jelly-like consistency and 
the fruit is transparent, pour into sterilized jelly glasses or jars. 
When cool, cover with a thin layer of paraffin and a tin or 
paper cover to exclude dust. Mark and store. 

A small quantity of fresh pineapple combined with the 
apricots makes an especially palatable marmalade. 

Carrot Marmalade 

4 pounds carrots 2 lemons, grated rind 

8 cups corn syrup 1 orange, juice and rind 

3 cups sugar 3/^ pound raisins, chopped 

10 lemons, juice 
Wash and scrape the carrots. Boil till tender and chop fine^ 
using a chopping knife and bowl. Simmer the chopped carrots 
and syrup together 30 minutes; then add the other ingredients 
and cook until thick and jelly-like. Put into sterilized jelly 
glasses. Cover wdth a thin layer of paraffin. Mark and store. 

Currant Conserve 

5 oranges 5 pounds sugar 

5 pounds currants or 2 pounds raisins 

gooseberries 
Boil the rind of 3 oranges until tender, scrape out the bitter 
white portion, and slice the yellow rind. Combine the currants, 
sugar, orange pulp, chopped rind, and raisins, and boil all to- 
gether 20 minutes. Turn into sterilized jars; seal at once. 

Fig Preserves 

3 pounds whole ripe figs 1 or 2 pieces ginger root 

3 pounds sugar 1 lemon, juice and rind 

1 pint w^ater 1 orange, juice and rind

89 



quarts boiling water) and let stand for 5 minutes. Drain off 
the soda solution and wash figs thoroughly in two baths of 
cold water. 

Boil the sugar and water, add the ginger root and cleaned 
figs, and cook the figs until very tender. Add orange and 
lemon juice and rind. Boil a few minutes longer, fill sterilized 
jars, and seal. Mark and store. 

Grape Jam 

1 basket ripe grapes Sugar 

Remove the grapes from the stem. Wash them and press 
the pulp from the skins. Boil the pulp until it will separate 

from the seeds. Rub through a sieve. Add the skins to the 

pulp and boil with an equal weight of sugar for 15 minutes. 

Put into sterilized jars and seal at once. Mark and store.

ters, reserving it for use, cut or shred the fruit fine, keeping the 



90 



seeds separate. Add 1 quart water to 1 pound fruit, reserving 
from the entire quantity of water 1 pint for seeds. Let this 
stand 36 hours covered; stir occasionally. Strain the water 
from the seeds and add it to the fruit; boil this mixture down one- 
half. Cook the peel until soft in enough boiling water to cover; 
drain; remove the white part by scraping with a spoon. Cut the 
thin yellow rind in strips, using a pair of scissors. Add to the 
marmalade 1 hour before it has finished boiling. When the 
marmalade is cool enough, measure, and to every pint of fruit 
add 1 pound of sugar, slowly, stirring all the time. Boil steadily 
20 to 30 minutes, or until the mixture jellies. Pour the mar- 
malade into sterilized jars and seal. Mark and store.

1 teaspoon cloves 

Wash, peel, and slice the peaches. Reserve and crack one 
stone. Tie the spices and peach seed in a cheese-cloth bag. 
Cook all materials together until sufficiently thickened (about 
30 to 50 minutes). A good test is to place a small amount on 
a saucer and when pushed to one side with a spoon a wrinkled 
appearance should result. Pour into sterilized glasses. Cover 
with a thin layer of melted paraffin. Cover with a tin lid or 
paper cover. Mark and store.

Sun-Preserved Berries 

Wash and weigh berries which have been freshly picked. 
Cover the berries with an equal amount of sugar and let them 
stand over night so that the sugar will all be dissolved. Let 
stand in cool place so as not to ferment. The next morning 
bring to boiling point and boil 10 minutes. Pour into platters 
or shallow porcelain or enamel dishes not more than 1 inch in 
depth. Cover with a piece of glass. Moisture will gather on 
the under side of the glass. This should be wiped off occasion- 
ally. The preserves should be placed in the sun until the 
thickness desired is obtained. This -is dependent upon the 
time of the day and the intensity of the sun. The preserves 
should be brought in at night-fall and set out the next morning 
if not thick enough. Eight hours should finish the preserves. 
If weather becomes rainy, finish in a slightly-warmed oven. 
Do not remove the glass and expose to the air. Place in steril- 
ized glasses and cover with paraffin. Mark and store.

Raspberries, dewberries, blackberries, cherries, straw- 
berries, or a combination of currants and red raspberries, or a 
combination of rhubarb and red raspberries may be prepared in 
this way. 

In order to protect the preserves from ants, the legs of the 
stand on which they are placed should be put into four sauce- 
dishes of water. 

Watermelon-Rind Preserves 

1 pound melon rind 1 pound sugar 

1 ounce lime 1 lemon 

2 quarts water 

Cut rind in V2 inch squares. Remove peel and all pink 
part, and weigh. Soak over night in lime water. The follow- 
ing morning allow rind to stand for 2 hours in clear water. 
Drain well, then drop into boiling water and cook rapidly for 
10 minutes. Drain again and add gradually to syrup made of 
sugar and 1 quart of water. Add to this the juice of ^ lemon 
and three extra slices of lemon, and cook until the rind is clear 
and transparent. Allow to stand covered with syrup until 
cool. Then arrange attractively in jars, garnishing with the 
slices of lemon. Seal, mark, and store. 

Yellow-Tomato Preserves 

1 pound ripe yellow tomatoes 1 stick ginger root 
(weighed after skinning) 1 lemon, juice and rind 

1 pound granulated sugar 
Scald, skin and weigh the tomatoes. Add sugar and ginger 

root and boil 2 hours, then add the lemon juice and rind; 

boil ^-2 hour; pour into sterilized jars, seal at once, mark and 

store. 

FRUIT JUICES 

When some fruits which contain a hirge amount of juice are 
very abundant the juices may be extracted and bottled for use 



94 



in preparing refreshing beverages. These fruit juices may also 
be used for flavoring desserts, such as puddings, ice creams, and 
sherbets, and in making pudding sauces. 

Grape Juice 

Pick ripe Concord grapes from the stem. Wash the grapes, 
crush, and heat them, stirring them all the time. When broken, 
pour into a jelly bag and allow the juice to drip from the grapes. 
Measure it and add one-fourth the amount of sugar. Cook the 
juice and sugar until they reach the boiling point. Put into 
sterilized bottles, cork, and seal immediately with bottle wax or 
paraffin. Mark and store. Dilute for serving. 

Raspberry Shrub 

Select sound fruit. Pick it over carefully. Wash, measure, 
and pack in a stone jar. Use 1 quart mild vinegar to every 4 
quarts berries. Tie cheese-cloth over jar. Stir the mixture each 
day for three or four days. Do not let it stand more than 3 days 
if the weather is very warm. Strain without squeezing, measure 
juice and put into a kettle, allowing 2 cups of sugar to every 
pint of liquid. Boil slowly 5 minutes. Put into sterilized 
bottles. Cork and dip into paraffin or bottle wax. Dilute with 
cold water for serving. 

Strawberries, blackberries, and dewberries may be used in 
the same way. 

BOTTLE WAX 

To seal corked bottles 
Mix together equal parts of warm shoemaker's wax and 
resin. When liquid, dip the corked bottles into it. 



CANDIES 

SUGAR 

(a) Sugar is used in cooking — 

( 1 ) To increase the carbohydrate in the diet. 

(2) To add flavor to other foods. 

(3) To aid in the preservation of other foods. 

(4) To serve as the basis for candies and cake frost- 

ings. 

(b) Sugar substitutes. 

(1) Maple syrup, molasses, sorghum, honey, com- 

mercial glucose and corn syrup may all be used 
as substitutes for sugar. However, the syrups 
are only from 75 per cent to 85 per cent as 
sweet as sugar and must be used in larger 
quantities than sugar if the same degree of 
sweetness is to be secured. 

(2) Syrups can be substituted for sugar in frostings 

and in all candies that are not to be crystallized, 
such as molasses candy and pulled white 
candy. In candies that are to be crystallized, 
syrups can be substituted for sugar to only a 
limited extent with the exception of maple 
syrup which readily crystallizes when boiled 
down. One part of syrup to three parts of 
sugar can safely be substituted in all candies. 
When some syrups are used even a higher rate 
of substitution is possible. 

(c) Methods of cooking sugar. 

( 1 ) By dry heat, as in the preparation of caramel. 

(2) By boiling with water — as in making syrups. 

(3) By boiling with acids — whereby it is converted 

95 



96 



into a substance which is only half as sweet as 
cane sugar and which does not crystallize. For 
this reason cream of tartar is used in making 
fondant, and vinegar is used in molasses candy, 
(d) Time for cooking syrups. 

The time for cooking syrups is regulated by the 
thickness of the syrups to be used. Thickness 
of syrups increases with boiling and evapora- 
tion. The temperature of syrup also rises, 
hence the time for cooking of syrup may be 
regulated by the thermometer. When cooking 
at home, syrup tests are generally made by 
dropping a few drops of the syrup into cold 
water to determine the thickness of the syrup 
when cold. The relation between the tw^o tests 
is given below. 

Syrup Tests 

Soft Ball 238 degrees, used for boiled frosting and 

fondant. 
Hard Ball 260 degrees, used for nougat. 

Crack 310 degrees, used for molasses candy 

Caramel 350 degrees, used for flavoring and for 

peanut brittle. 
Dark Caramel 400 degrees, used for coloring gravies, 

soups, etc. 

Butter Scotch 

1 cup molasses ^ cup butter 

1 cup brown sugar 1 tablespoon vinegar 

^ cup water 
Mix all the ingredients thoroughly and boil them until the 
syrup is brittle when tried in cold water. Then pour into a 
buttered pan, cool, and mark in squares or break in pieces for 
servinor. Serves 16 to 20. 



97 



Candied Orange Peel 

1 orange peel ^ cup sugar or syrup 

y^ cup water in which orange was cooked 

Wipe orange and remove peel in quarters. Cut in narrow 
strips and remove surplus white. Cook in boiling water until 
tender, changing water several times. Drain well. 

Make syrup with ^ cup of the last water used, and the 
sugar. If syrup is used, no water need be added. When the 
sugar is all dissolved add orange rind, and cook slowly until 
most of the water has evaporated. Drain the rind, and roll 
each piece in granulated sugar. Serves 12 to 16. 

Caramels 

2 cups sugar 1 pint cream 

y^ cup glucose ^ cup pecans 

^ cup butter 1 teaspoon vanilla 

Combine sugar, glucose, butter, and 1 cup cream and 
heat until it boils thorci^aghly. Add remainder of cream 
gradually stirring it in not to stop boiling. Stir every three 
or four minutes, cooking till it reaches the temperature of 
252 degrees, or a firm hard ball is formed in cold water. 
Add nuts and vanilla and turn into buttered pans to make a 
sheet y^ inch thick. When cold cut in cubes, let dry 24 hours. 

Caramel Fudge 

2 cups sugar 1 tablespoon butter 

1 cup milk ^ cup nuts, broken up 

cup caramelized sugar 

Boil sugar and milk together, add caramelized sugar and 
butter, and boil to the soft ball stage. Take from fire and heat 
until the candy becomes creamy. Add nuts and turn into 
buttered pans; when cool cut into squares. Serves 16 to 20. 

Caramel Syrup 

1 cup granulated sugar 1 cup boiling water 



98 



Melt sugar in a smooth pan, stir over the fire until it be- 
comes a deep, dark brown (400 degrees F.). Add the boiling 
water and cook slowly until the hardened sugar is dissolved. 
Cool, bottle, and keep tightly corked. 

Uses for Caramel 

Caramel (cooked sugar) may be used for candies, nut brit- 
tle, glace, etc. 

Caramel may be made into syrup and used as a sauce, or 
it may be substituted for sugar (1^ cup caramel for 1 cup 
sugar) to sweeten and flavor sweet dishes (custards, puddings, 
frostings, ice cream, etc.) 

Caramel which is very dark may be made into a syrup and 
used to color gravies, soups, and invalid dishes, i. e. cereals, 
corn starch puddings, etc., (1 tablespoon caramel to 1 pint).

Double Fudge 

Prepare one recipe chocolate fudge, pour into a shallow 
pan to form a layer one-half inch thick. Over this pour a 
layer of freshly prepared pinoche of equal thickness. When 
firm cut in squares. 

Fondant 

2 cups sugar }i teaspoon cream of tartar 

y^ cup boiling water 

Put ingredients into smooth sauce pan, stir and heat 
gradually to the boiling point, then boil without stirring until, 
when tried in cold water, a soft ball may be formed (at which 
time syrup will be 238 degrees F). Pour upon oiled marble 
slab or buttered plate and let stand a few minutes to cool, but 
not long enough to grow hard about the edges, (to from 90 de- 
grees to 100 degrees) then work with wooden spoon until white 
and creamy. When fondant begins to form lumps, knead 



99 



quickly with the hands until perfectly creamy. Pack in bowl, 
cover with oiled paper, and let stand 24 hours, after which 
flavor, color, and shape as desired. During cooking sugar mil 
adhere to side of saucepan, this should be washed off with 
fingers or cloth dipped in cold water. Serves 30. 

Uses for Fondant 

Fondant is used as a basis for many candies, to stuff dried 
fruits and to frost small cakes. 

For candy the finished fondant is flavored, colored, and 
shaped as desired. Nuts are often put on top of each piece or 
two halves of the nuts may be used and one-half put on each 
side of the candy. The fondant may be worked up with chopped 
nuts or candied fruits and cut in cubes. Chocolate drops may 
be made by dipping the shaped fondant into melted chocolate. 

Peppermint drops may be made by remelting the fondant 
after it has been flavored with peppermint and dropping it on 
to paraffin paper in the shapes desired. 

Fondant may be used with stuffed dates, figs, or prunes. 
For stuffed dates, wash the dates, cut open lengthwise, remove 
stone and insert a small piece of fondant rolled to resemble the 
date stone. Chopped nuts or peanut butter may be added to the 
fondant. After stuffing, roll dates in granulated or powdered 
sugar. 

To frost small cakes, remelt the fondant in a double boiler 
after it has been flavored and kneaded. When it is thoroughly 
melted, dip in the small cakes from the end of a fork so that 
the frosting will entirely cover the top and partially cover the 
sides. It will be necessary to work quickly and to stir the fon- 
dant occasionally for it will have a tendency to become too thick. 
The top of each cake may be decorated with a piece of blanched 
almond or candied fruit.

CEREALS 

Cereals should be kept in a dry place protected from the 
moisture of the air. As a rule they do not spoil readily unless 
warm and damp. 

Before using, cereals should be carefully examined to make 
sure that they are in good condition. 

The purpose of cooking cereals is: — (1) to soften the 
cellulose; (2) to cook the starch; (3) to add water; (4) to 
develop flavor. 

The time for cooking cereals is dependent on the nature of 
the cellulose and the form in which the grain has been prepared. 
The shortest time is required for rice, then wheat, oats, corn, in 
order. 

The term "mush" is applied to the cereal when cooked in 
the form of a rather thin pudding. "Porridge" is thinner than 
mush. "Gruels" are made thinner than mush by the addition 
of milk or water and are always strained. 

General Directions for Cooking Cereals 

Look grain over carefully. 

Measure grain and liquid accurately. Amount of liquid 
may be varied according to consistency of mush desired. 

Salt the water, using 1 teaspoon salt to 1 cup cereal. 

Have the water boiling as cereal is added. 

Add cereal so slowly that bubbling of water may not be 
stopped. 

Boil rapidly 10 to 15 minutes, stirring constantly. 

Then cover and cook in a double boiler or a fireless cooker 
without stirring for remainder of time. Increase time for cook- 
ing two or three hours if the cereal is put in the fireless cooker. 

AA'hen it is necessary to replenish water in lower part of 
double boiler, boiling water should be used. 

104 



105 



Cook continuously. 

General directions will have to be varied somewhat in 
cooking rice and some of the special cereal preparations. 

Cold cooked cereals can always be reheated in a double 
boiler with the addition of water, if necessary, and served as 
freshly cooked cereals. 

Methods of cooking cereals are: — 

(1) Hot, with milk, cream, or butter — with or without 

sugar. 

(2) Cooled in molds and served with cream as a simple 

dessert. 

(3) Cooled in molds, sliced, dipped in flour browned in 

butter or other fat, served hot. 

(4) Cooled, shaped into balls, and fried in deep fat. 

Served with meat as a vegetable or with sweet sauce 
as dessert. 

(5) Served with uncooked fruit, such as bananas, berries, 

pineapple, dates, etc.; or cooked fruit, as apples, 
pears, etc.

EGGS 

To be of value in cooking, eggs should be fresh as the 
flavor becomes affected with age. Old eggs are not so satis- 
factory for use in cooking as fresh because in the old egg it is 
more difficult to separate the white and the yolk, and the white 
is less elastic and does not beat up so well. 

Tests for a fresh egg: 

(1) There is a bloom on the shell, it does not show a 

shiny surface. 

(2) The contents of the shell look clear when held to the 

light, the yolk shows in the center. 

(3) The egg does not rattle when shaken. 

(4) The fresh egg sinks in water and does not float on the 

surface. 

The price of eggs varies widely with the season. They are 
usually sold by the dozen, but they are also sold by the pound, 
as they vary so greatly in size and weight. One dozen eggs 
weighs from 17.5 oz. to 28 oz. 

Care of Eggs 

Eggs should be kept in a cool, dry place. If to be 
stored they may be packed, small end down, in bran, salt, 
sand, or sawdust; immersed in water glass, lime water, or coated 
with fat. Eggs can be kept fresh several weeks if each egg is 
wrapped separately in paper. Evaporation and canning of eggs 
are commercial methods of preservation. 

Eggs should be handled carefully so that the membranes 
about yolk will not be broken. 

They should be washed just before breaking for use. 

Shells of eggs should be saved to clear coffee. 

The left-over yolk of an egg, if unbroken, may be kept 
from hardening by being covered with cold water or with paraf- 
fin paper. The whites will keep a day or two if cold.

Cooking of Eggs 

Eggs are cooked: — 

( 1 ) To make them more palatable as flavor is developed. 

(2) To make them more attractive as albumen coagulates 

and becomes white. 

(3) To improve the texture and cause it to become 

jelly-like. 

(4) To break up the tissue of the egg (scrambled eggs 

and custards). 

(5) To make the egg light by the introduction of air 

(omelets). 

(6) To combine the egg with other food materials 

a. In order to thicken or give them consistency 
(soups and sauces). 

b. In order to make mixtures light (cakes, puddings, 

popovers). 

c. To add flavor to other foods (puddings and 

cakes). 

d. To add color to other foods (puddings, cakes, 

and sauces). 

e. To increase the nutritive value of other foods 

(soups, puddings, and batters). 

Methods of Cooking Eggs 

(1) In hot water. 

a. In shell 

Soft cooked 
Hard cooked 

b. Without shell 

Poached 

(2) In double boiler, surrounded by water, combined with 

milk. Custards, scrambled or coddled. 



112 



(3) In dry heat of oven 

a. Baked or shirred (unbeaten) 

b. Souffle (beaten) 

(4) In hot fat in frying pan. 

a. Fried (unbeaten) 

b. Omelets (beaten) 

The protein present in eggs coagulates when heated, the 
white at 134 degrees, the yolk at 122 degrees. 

The best cooking temperature is 160 to 180 degrees. 
Economy in Usingf Eggs in Cooking 

(1) If eggs are used as a thickening in sauce, soup, salad 
dressing, or pudding, they can be replaced by flour or corn 
starch. One whole egg can be replaced by 2 tablespoons flour; 
one egg yolk by 1 tablespoon flour. 

(2) If eggs are used to make mixtures light, they can be 
replaced in part by baking powder. One teaspoon baking powder 
can be substituted for two eggs in a butter cake. 

If one cup of flour is made light wholly by the use of 
eggs, six are necessary. If one cup of flour is made light 
wholly by the use of baking powder two teaspoons are sufficient. 

(3) In frostings and confectionery, eggs can be replaced 
by water, milk, and cream. 

Serving 

Because eggs are altogether lacking in the carbohydrates 
they should always be combined or served with starchy food. 
Parsley and other pungent greens make attractive garnishes. Dry 
toast or wafers are appropriate accompaniments as they induce 
thorough mastication. 

Soft Cooked Eggs 

Put the eggs in boiling water sufficient to cover, cover the 
kettle, remove from the fire, but keep hot, and let stand from 5 
to 8 minutes according to the consistency desired. 



113 



Hard Cooked Eggs 

Put the eggs in cold water, cover, heat, and when the water 
boils, reduce heat and let them stand 20 minutes w4th water 
just below the boiling point, then put into cold water for a few 
minutes to loosen the shells. 

Poached Eggs 

Break each egg into a saucer carefully, slip the eggs into 
boiling water, decrease the heat, and cook 5 minutes or until 
the white is firm, and a film has formed over the yolk. Take up 
with a skimmer, drain, trim off rough edges and serve on slices 
of toast. Season. 

Poached eggs are attractive covered with white sauce to 
w^hich chopped parsley has been added. 

Baked or Shirred Eggs 

Line a buttered baking dish with buttered bread crumbs, 
break eggs into dish without separating, add 1 tablespoon milk 
or cream for each egg. Season with salt and pepper, and sprinkle 
with grated cheese, if desired; or bread crumbs may be omitted 
and dish lined with cold mashed potatoes. Bake in a moderate 
oven till eggs are set. 

Creamed Eggs 

3 hard cooked eggs 6 slices toast 
1 cup medium white sauce 

Prepare white sauce and add hard cooked eggs cut in 
halves, slices, or chopped, and when hot serve on toast. 

Or separate white and yolks of hard cooked eggs, chop 
white fine, add to white sauce, and when hot serve on toast and 
garnish wdth yolks run through a sieve or ricer. Season with 
salt and pepper. Serves 4 to 6. 

3crambled or Coddled Eggs 

4 eggs 2 tablespoons milk 
1 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon butter 
Pepper 



114 



Beat the eggs slightly, adding the salt, pepper, and milk. 
Melt the butter in a sauce pan. Add the eggs and cook slowly 
until thickened. Stir frequently and remove from the heat as 
soon as finished. Scrambled or Coddled Eggs are best if cooked 
over hot water for then there is less danger of over cooking them. 
Serves 6. 

OMELETS 

There are two classes of omelets, the French or Creamy 
omelets in which the eggs are beaten all together and only 
slightly, and light omelet in which the eggs are separated and 
whites beaten stiff and cut and folded into the yolk mixture. 
The light omelets include the Foamy Omelet in which the egg 
is combined w^th w^ater, milk or other liquid, and the Omelet 
Souffle, in w^hich the liquid used is thickened wath flour, cooked 
as in a w^hite sauce, or in the form of softened bread crumbs. 

The omelet recipes given are for an individual portion. To 
make a large omelet multiply the quantity of each ingredient by 
the number of eggs used. The best results will be obtained by 
making an omelet of not more than four eggs, as larger omelets 
are difficult to cook thoroughly and to handle well. A two-egg 
omelet will serve three people. A four-egg omelet will serve 
six people. 

The omelet pan must be perfectly smooth. Care must be 
taken to cook the omelets slowly, at a low temperature so that 
the egg does not become tough and dry, and the bottom of the 
omelet must be carefully watched for the entire omelet will be 
spoiled if one portion burns. 

Serve the omelet immediately when cooked, as steam es- 
capes and an omelet falls w^hen cold. Use a fork or spoon in 
serving; if an omelet is so tough that it requires a knife to cut 
it the time of cooking has been too long or the temperature too 
high. An omelet will be more tender if the number of yolks 
exceeds the number of whites. 



115 



Omelets are used for breakfast, luncheon, supper, or as 
simple desserts. 

Variations of the Omelet 

1. Serve with white sauce, tomato sauce, or oyster sauce. 

2. Serve with a garnish of chopped parsley, olives, green 
peppers, cooked peas, green beans, or asparagus tips. 

3. Use bacon fat in an omelet pan and serve omelet with 
a garnish of crisp bacon. 

4. Before folding omelet, spread ^^dth chopped ham, 
tongue, mushrooms, grated cheese, broiled oysters, or cooked 
vegetables. 

5. In place of milk or cold water use 1 tablespoon hot 
water to each egg, or 4 tablespoons white sauce, or 2 tablespoons 
bread crumbs softened in milk, or 4 tablespoons tomato sauce. 

6. Add grated cheese, or chopped tongue, parsley, onions, 
or chopped asparagus to yolk mixture. 

7. Turn the omelet into a buttered baking dish and bake 
in the oven, serve in dish. 

8. Substitute sugar (1 tablespoon to each egg) for salt and 
pepper, fruit juice or caramel syrup for milk, and serve with 
jelly or a sweet sauce, grated pineapple, or sliced oranges, or 
cover with powdered sugar and score with a hot poker to cara- 
melize sugar. 

9. Souffles are a variation of the omelet. 

Creamy Omelet 

1 egg 1 tablespoon milk 

y^ teaspoon salt ^ teaspoon butter 

Pepper 

Beat the egg slightly, add the milk and seasonings; put 
butter in the hot omelet pan, when melted turn in the mixture; 
as it cooks draw the edges toward the center until the whole is 
of a creamy consistency; brown quickly underneath; fold and 
turn onto a hot platter. Serve at once. Serves 1. 



116 



To serve several people, multiply each ingredient by the 
number of eggs used. Also called French Omelet. 

Foamy Omelet 

1 egg 1 tablespoon milk or water 

ys teaspoon salt j^ teaspoon butter 

Cayenne or white pepper 

Beat the yolk of the egg until creamy, add the seasonings 
and milk; beat the white until stiff, but not dry, cut and fold 
into the yolk carefully with the flat egg beater; heat an omelet 
pan, rub bottom and sides with the butter, turn in the omelet, 
spread it evenly on the pan. Cook gently over heat until the 
omelet is set and evenly browned underneath; put it into a hot 
oven for a few minutes to dry slightly on top; fold and serve 
immediately. Serves 1. 

To serve several people multiply each ingredient by the 
number, of eggs used. 

Omelet Souffle 

Yz tablespoon butter ^ cup milk 

^ tablespoon flour 1 egg 

ys teaspoon salt ^ teaspoon butter 

Pepper 
Make a white sauce ; separate the yolk and white of the egg, 
and beat them until light; when white sauce is cool, add the 
yolk, and cut in the white with the flat egg beater. Cook in 
the same way as Foamy Omelet or follow directions for baked 
omelet. Serves 1. 

Baked Omelet 

Prepare the recipe for Omelet Souffle. Turn into a but- 
tered baking dish, place the dish in a pan containing hot water 
and bake slowly 20 to 30 minutes in a moderate oven. If a 
heayv' earthen baking dish is used it need not be placed in hot 
water. 



117 



Spanish Omelet 

Follow the recipe for Creamy omelet using four eggs and 
serve with a well seasoned tomato sauce in the center and 
around the omelet. 

Use half the recipe for tomato puree given in the book, 
and add one finely chopped green pepper. Do not strain. 
Just before serving, two tablespoons chopped pickles may be 
added to the sauce. Serves 6. 

SOUFFLES 

Souffles are preparations which are "puffed up" or made 
light by the presence of whites of eggs. They are much used as 
entrees and may be either savory or sweet in character. Souffles 
are a variation of the foamy omelet. 

The foundation for a souffle is usually a white sauce to 
which is added the food material which is to give it special 
flavor, the egg yolks and finally the well-beaten whites. 

Proportions. For each cup of thick w^hite sauce (2 table- 
spoons butter, 4 tablespoons flour, 1 cup milk) or an equally 
thick paste of bread and milk, use from ^< cup to 1 cup of 
cooked meat, poultry, fish, sweetbreads, mushrooms, or cheese, 
finely chopped and well-seasoned, and from 2 to 4 eggs. Add 
the well-beaten egg yolks to the sauce and meat, and when cool 
cut and fold in the well-beaten whites of eggs. Turn into well- 
buttered moulds (one large or individual) set in a pan of water 
and cook in a slow oven until puffed and firm. 

Serve hot in the dish in which it is cooked, with or without 
a sauce. 

Paper cases, scallop shells, or ramekins may be used for 
the individual dishes. 

Vegetable and fruit souffles may be made without the sauce 
as they contain a large amount of juice. 

Souffles of potatoes, parsnips, peas, etc., may require 



118 



moistening with a little cream or milk before folding in a well- 
beaten egg. See chicken, fish, and onion souffle. 

Cheese Souffle 

2 tablespoons butter % cup milk 

3 tablespoons flout 3 eggs 

y2 teaspoon salt 1 cup or Yz pound grated 

Cayenne cheese 

Put the butter in a saucepan, when hot add the flour and 
seasonings, and stir until smooth; add the milk slowly and 
stir until it boils, remove from the fire, and add the well-beaten 
yolks and the cheese. Mix well and cool. When cold, cut and 
fold in whites of eggs well-beaten, then turn into a buttered 
dish, and bake from 20 to 25 minutes in a large dish, 15 min- 
utes in individual dishes. Serve immediately. Serves 6 to 8. 

Fish Souffle 

Follow the recipe for cheese souffle, substituting 1 cup 
cold cooked fish finely flaked for the grated cheese. 

Chicken Souffle 

Follow the recipe for cheese souffle, substituting 1 cup 
cooked chicken finely chopped for the grated cheese. 

Onion Souffle 

Follow the recipe for cheese souffle, substituting 1 cup 
boiled onions finely chopped for the grated cheese. 



MILK 

Milk should be kept in a cool, clean place, free from 
odors, in a perfectly clean, covered vessel of suitable material — 
earthen, porcelain, glass or tin. The sanitary condition of milk 
is of the utmost importance as it easily becomes a medium for 
the distribution of disease germs, readily absorbs odors, flavors, 
and impurities, and undergoes fermentation. 

To clean the vessels in which milk is kept, rinse out first 
with cold water, then wash with hot water and soap, adding 
a little borax or washing soda to the water. Scald well, rinse 
with clear water and let the bottles cool. To sterilize the vessels, 
fill with cold water and heat to the boiling point, boiling 20 
minutes. Let vessels stand in the sun 2 to 3 hours when pos- 
sible. 

Because of the danger from disease germs in impure milk 
or of the development of lactic acid bacteria in milk, it is 
often necessary to apply heat to kill all bacteria in order to 
make it safe for use as food or to keep it for even a short time. 

Pasteurization is the most desirable method of preserving 
milk, the disease germs are destroyed, the milk will keep sweet 
from one to four days and the digestibility of the milk is but 
little affected. 

Sterilization is the most effective method of preserving 
milk, as both bacteria and their spores are destroyed but the 
taste of the milk is altered by sterilization, the emulsion of fat 
is destroyed, the lact-albumen is coagulated and the casein is 
rendered less easy of digestion. 

Cream separates from the heavier liquid in the milk by 
the force of gravity when standing or by centrifugal force in 
the separator — this separation is more complete when the milk 
is a few da}S old. The older cream also whips more easily. 

Acids cause the casein in the milk to curdle. This action 

119 



120 



takes place when lactic acid is produced in sour milk or by the 
addition of vinegar, lemon juice, or tartaric acid to milk. 

^Milk is coat^ulated by the action of rennin, a ferment of 
the gastric juice, especially abundant in the infant's stomach. 
This action takes place if the milk has not been heated over 
120 degrees. Rennet is rennin artificially prepared for com- 
mercial use from the fourth part of the stomach of a calf, in the 
form of tablets by the addition of milk sugar. 

Milk is sometimes altered in order more nearly to resemble 
human milk. For this purpose the protein must be decreased, 
the carbohydrate increased, the milk given an alkalin reaction 
and the fat retained in relatively the same proportion. This is 
called "Modified" milk. 

Cooking of Milk 

When milk is heated the albumen becomes coagulated at 
158 degrees and the casinogen is changed. A scum consisting 
of coagulated lact-albumen, some dried casein, lime salts, and 
fat, forms on the bottom and sides of the kettle and over the 
top of the milk. 

The taste of milk changes as it is heated and it is easily 
scorched, growing darker in color. Because of the danger of 
scorching milk and of the effect that too high a degree of heat 
has on the albumen, making it more difficult of digestion, milk 
should be heated in a perfectly smooth vessel and whenever pos- 
sible it should be heated over hot water in a double boiler. 
When a skin forms on top with bubbles around the side, milk 
is said to be scalded and is hot enough for most purposes in 
cooking. 

All utensils which have held milk should be rinsed in cold 
water before being put in hot. Salt should not be added to 
milk when it is to be heated for some time, for it may cause 
milk to curdle. 



121 



Reasons for Heating Milk 

Milk is heated for the purpose of preservation; to introduce 
heat into the body; and to combine it with other foods. Milk 
forms the basis of many cooked dishes, for example cocoa, 
cream soups, white sauce, custards, and other puddings. Either 
whole milk or skimmed milk may be used for cooking. In many 
recipes water may be substituted for the milk, but one must 
then take into consideration the reduction in food value of the 
dish. 

Sterilized Milk 

When it is necessary to preserve mJlk in order that it may 
be kept for some time, the temperature should be raised to the 
boiling point and kept there 10 to 20 minutes. The milk should 
then be strained and quickly cooled. Milk sterilized in this 
way and put into clean utensils, carefully covered, can be 
kept for many days. 

Pasteurized Milk 

Fill sterile bottles or jars full of milk, cork them with 
cotton that has been baked in the oven and place on rings in a 
deep pan. Fill the pan with cold water so that the water may be 
as high outside the jars as the milk is inside, place the pan 
over the fire and heat until small bubbles appear around the 
top of the milk (158 degrees F), and keep at this temperature 
20 to 30 minutes, then reduce temperature as quickly as possible. 

Rennet or Junket 

1 quart milk 1 tablespoon rennet or 1 tab- 

2 -tablespoons sugar let (dissolved in ^4 cup 

lukewarm water) 

Heat the milk until lukewarm, add sugar, and stir until 
sugar is dissolved. Add rennet, stir slightly, pour into glass dish. 



122 



and leave in a warm place until firm. Sprinkle with nutmeg 
and chill. Serve with sugar and cream. Do not jar. Rennet 
should be handled carefully, so as not to break mass, as curd 
and whey separate. Rennet may be improved by addition of 
such fresh fruits as strawberries, raspberries, etc. Serves 8. 



CUSTARDS 

A custard is a combination of eggs and milk, usually 
sweetened and flavored and either steamed or baked as cup 
custard, or cooked in a double boiler as soft custard. The whole 
egg may be used or the yolks alone. The yolks make a smoother, 
richer custard. One whole egg or two yolks of eggs will be 
sufficient for one quart of milk. 

The egg must be thoroughly mixed, but not beaten light, 
the sugar and salt added and the milk scalded and stirred 
in slowly. The custard must be strained through a fine sieve 
and cooked at a moderate temperature. The cup custard should 
be strained before cooking, the soft custard may be strained after 
cooking. 

A soft custard is cooked over water and is stirred con- 
stantly until done. When done the froth disappears from the 
surface, the custard is thickened and coats the spoon and sides 
of the pan, and there is no sign of curdling. If the custard is 
cooked too long it becomes curdled. If a custard becomes 
curdled, put it in a pan of cold water and beat until smooth. 

A steamed or baked custard is done when it becomes set and 
when a silver knife will come out clean after cutting it. 

Steamed Custards 

1 quart milk (heated) Salt. 

4 eggs or 10 egg yolks 2 tablespoons caramel or 

^ cup sugar yi teaspoon nutmeg 

Beat eggs sufficiently to mix them thoroughly; add sugar, 
salt, and hot milk slowly. 

Strain into cups, flavor with caramel or sprinkle nutmeg 
on top, and steam until firm over gently boiling water, 20 to 
30 minutes. Serves 6 to 8. 

123 



124 



Baked Custards 

Prepare as steamed custards, set in pan of hot water, and 
bake in a slow oven until firm; 20 to 40 minutes. 

Chocolate Custards 

Use recipe for steamed custards adding 1 oz. Baker's 
Chocolate (melted) to the hot milk. Steam or bake as desired. 

Soft Custard 

1 pint milk (heated) Salt 

4 egg yolks j^ teaspoon vanilla extract 

4 tablespoons sugar 

Beat egg yolks sufficiently to mix them thoroughly, add 
sugar, salt, and hot milk slowly. Cook in double boiler over 
water that is boiling gently and stir constantly until the cus- 
tard thickens. Strain. When cool, add flavor. 

For soft chocolate custard add ^ oz. Baker's Chocolate 
(melted) to the hot milk. Serves 6. 

Floating Island 

Use recipe for soft custard and when cold garnish the cus- 
tard with a meringue made according to the following recipe: 

Meringue 

4 egg whites j4 cup powdered sugar 

Beat egg whites very light, add powdered sugar and con- 
tinue beating. Drop in large spoonfuls on cold custard. Serves 
8 to 10. 

The meringue may be cooked, if desired, by slipping a 
spoonful at a time on top of the scalded milk and covering the 
double boiler carefully. When the meringue is set, it should be 
carefully removed to a plate until custard is made. 



125 



Tapioca Cream 

Yz cup pearl tapioca y^, cup sugar 

1 cup cold water Y^ teaspoon salt 

2 cups milk 2 egg whites 

2 ^gg yolks Yz teaspoon vanilla 

Soak the tapioca several hours in cold water until it absorbs 
the water, add milk and cook until tapioca is soft and transpar- 
ent, add yolk of egg, sugar, and salt; cook 3 minutes over water, 
stirring constantly; remove from fire; add the beaten whites and 
flavoring, and when cold serve. Serves 8. 

Rice Cream 

Use the recipe for tapioca cream, substituting 1 cup boiled 
rice {Yz cup uncooked) for the soaked tapioca. Heat the rice 
in hot milk in a double boiler until soft. 



CHEESE 

Cheese should be kept in a cool, dry ]:)lace in a ventilated 
tin box or covered with cheese cloth. Do not keep cheese in ice 
box or cupboard near other food. When cheese becomes hard and 
dry, grate and keep to use in cooked dishes. Soft cheese does not 
keep well, hence it must be purchased in small quantities, tightly 
wrapped and kept very cold. Soft cheeses usually come wrapped 
in paraffin paper and tin foil. 

Cheese is cooked to change the flavor, to melt the cheese, 
and to combine it with other foods. Cheese is more easy of 
digestion when combined with other foods and it increases the 
food value of the dish to which it is added. 

A high temperature and prolonged cooking toughen cheese. 
The best results in cooking cheese are always obtained if cheese 
is combined with other materials. A dry, crumbly cheese is 
most easily broken up and mixed with other food, and gives the 
best results in cooking. 

Cottage Cheese 

When milk has become sour enough to show a well-thick- 
ened curd, heat it slowly until the whey rises to the top, pour 
this off, put the curd in a bag and let it drip for several hours 
without squeezing. The separation of the curd may be more 
quickly effected by pouring boiling water into the sour milk. 
Put the curd into a bowl and break fine with a wooden spoon, 
season with salt, and mix into a paste with a little cream or 
butter. Mold into balls, if desired, and chill before serving. (It 
is best when fresh.)

the onion; cook slowly until soft, rub through a strainer and add 
the remainder of the liquid; melt butter, add flour and season- 
ings, then hot milk with the liquid from the peas, and cook until 
it is like thick cream. Cooking a ham bone with the peas im- 
proves the flavor. Serves 6 to 8. 

Black Bean Soup 

1 pint black beans 2 teaspoons salt 

1 tablespoon chopped onion ^ teaspoon pepper 
4 tablespoons butter or ^ lb. Cayenne 

fat salt pork j/^ teaspoon mustard 

2 stalks celery or % teaspoon 2 tablespoons flour 

celery salt 1 large lemon 

2 quarts cold water 2 hard cooked eggs 

Wash the beans and soak them over night in cold water, 
drain, and rinse thoroughly. Fry the onions in one-half of the 
fat, put with beans, add the celery root and 2 quarts cold water. 
Cook slowly until beans are soft, adding more water as it boils 
away; rub through a strainer, add the seasonings, and heat. Heat 
the remaining fat in a saucepan, add flour, then the hot soup 
gradually. Cut the lemon and eggs into thin slices and serve 
with the soup as a garnish. Serves 8. 

Dried Bean Soup 

1 quart dried beans 2 quarts cold water 

1 tablespoon chopped onion 2 teaspoons salt 

}4 pound fat salt pork % teaspoon Cayenne pepper 

2 stalks celery, or % tea- 54 teaspoon mustard 

spoon celery salt 2 tablespoons flour 



131 



AA'ash the beans and soak them over night in cold water, 
drain, and rinse thoroughly. Fry the onions in one half the fat, 
put with beans, add the celery salt and 2 quarts of cold water. 
Cook slowly until the beans are soft, adding more water as it 
boils away; rub through a strainer, add the seasonings and re- 
heat. Heat the remaining fat in a saucepan, add flour, then add 
the hot soup gradually. Serves 6 to 8. 

CREAM SOUPS 

The strained pulp of cooked vegetables, greens, and cereals 
with an equal portion of thin white sauce is the basis of cream 
soups. 

Thickening. A binding of butter and flour is used to pre- 
vent a separation of the thicker and thinner parts of soup; the 
butter should be heated until it bubbles, the flour and seasoning 
added, and then sufficient hot liquid to make a smooth sauce; 
this should be poured into the rest of the hot liquid just before 
the soup is to be served, and the soup should not be allowed to 
boil, after the vegetable pulp and milk have been combined, but 
kept over hot water. 

Two tablespoons of flour or half that amount of corn starch 
to each quart of soup is a good proportion to observe for thicken- 
ing all vegetable soups that are not of a starchy nature, half 
that amount will be sufficient for soup prepared from a very 
starchy vegetable. 

Economy. Attractive cream soups can be prepared from 
left-over vegetables and a combination of flavors may give good 
results. 

Cooking. The acid present in nearly all vegetables is very 
apt to produce a curdling in the milk if too high a temperature 
is maintained after they are combined. It is well not to combine 
the milk and the vegetable until just before serving. 



132 

Serving. Cream soups are served for luncheon and supper 
or with dinner if the other courses are not too rich. 

Accompaniments. Crisp crackers, croutons, soup sticks, or 
bread sticks are served as accompaniments with cream soups 
and are valuable because they necessitate thorough mastication, 
hence induce the flow of saliva and aid in the digestion of the 
starchy ingredients of the soup. 

Cream of Tomato Soup 

1 quart tomatoes j/s cup flour 

fresh or canned 2 teaspoons salt 

54 teaspoon soda 34 teaspoon white pepper 

% or y^ cup butter or 1 quart milk (heated) 

butter substitute 
Cover and stew the tomatoes slowly one-half to one hour,

MEAT SOUPS 

Soup stock consists of the juices and soluble portions of 
meat or fish, bones and vegetables which have been extracted by 
long, slow cooking. The basis of stock may be beef, veal, mutton, 
fish, poultry, game, and vegetables. Proportions used should be 
Yz meat, Yz bone and 1 pint w^ater to each 1 lb. meat. 

All waste portions of meat and bone and bits of cold cooked 
meats that have not been charred in cooking can be utilized in 
making stock. 

Vegetables and seasonings may be varied. 

Soup vegetables include carrots, turnips, celery, onions, 
leeks, and parsley. For seasoning, the pot herbs (summer savory, 
thyme, and marjoram), the bay leaf, cloves, peppercorns, salt, 
and pepper are used in soup. Tomatoes can be combined with 
brown stock to add flavor. 



136 



Rules to be Remembered in Making Stock 

1 Cut the meat up fine and put in cold water, for y^ to 

1 hour. 

2 Heat to boilinc; point and then simmer slowly 5 to 7 

hours. 

3 Add no starchy substance if stock is to be kept for 

some time. 

4 When cooked, strain and cool quickly, leaving stock un- 

covered until cold. 

5 The fat should not be removed from stock or broths that 

are to be kept, as when cold it will form a thin cover- 
ing over the stock excluding air and preventing de- 
composition. It should be entirely removed before 
reheating stock or broth, and should be reserved to be 
used in place of drippings. Small globules of fat 
may be removed from cold stock by skimming with a 
cloth, which has been dipped in boiling water, then 
wrung dry. Fat may be removed from hot broth by 
using tissue paper or a piece of bread. 

6 The meat which remains after straining the stock may 

be used in any recipe which calls for cold cooked meat 
— such as minced meat, croquettes, etc. 

Brown soup stock is prepared from beef, and the best results 
are obtained by browning a portion of the meat or by using cold 
cooked meat that is browned. It is usually seasoned wdth vege- 
tables, spices, and herbs. 

White Soup Stock is prepared from veal, turkey, chicken, 
or rabbit, delicately seasoned. 

Soup stock which is prepared from mutton is used only in 
special recipes and should not be combined with that from other 
meats. 

Bouillon is made from lean beef, delicately seasoned and 
clear. 



137 



Consomme is made from two or three kinds of meat — beef, 
veal, or fowl, and usually cleared. 
Broth is uncleared soup stock. 

Beef Stock or Brown Stock 

4 lb. meat and bone 2 quarts cold water

in cold water, then cook at a low temperature for 5 hours. (Add 
vegetables if desired, then cook 2 hours longer.) Strain, chill 
quickly. Skim off fat before using. Serves 6. 

The trimmings and bones of fresh meats or bones and 
pieces from roasts may be cut into small pieces and used for 
stock, but no smoked or charred pieces of meat or bone should 
be used. Stock may be used for soups, gravies, and sauces. 
Dark caramel may be added to give a rich color. 

Beef stock is the foundation of all dark meat soups and is 
seasoned as desired with vegetables, cereals, or other flavors. 

White Stock

MEAT 

The term "meats" applies to the flesh of animals which is 
used as food and includes Meats Proper, Poultry, and Game. 

Specifically the term "meat" is applied to the flesh of 
domestic animals which is used as food — beef, veal, mutton, 
lamb and pork. 

The parts of animals used for food include the muscular 
tissue with fat and bone; special organs as the heart, liver, 
kidney, tongue, etc.; and such glands as the sweetbreads, pan- 
creas, brains, etc. 

The quality of the meat is dependent upon the following 
points : 

1 Breed of the animal. 

2 Age of the animal — Beef, three to eight years. 

Mutton, over one year. 
Veal, six to ten weeks. 
Lamb, under one year. 

3 Size of the animal. 

4 Manner of fattening — stall fed or grass fed. 

5 Amount of exercise. 

6 Length of time killed 

In preparation for market, the animal is killed, bled, 
dressed, and hung in a room whose temperature is slightly above 
the freezing point. During hanging a process of ripening takes 
place which causes the meat to become more tender. The meat 
of young animals is allowed to ripen for a few days, beef for 
three weeks, and mutton for even a longer time. 

When meat is sold it is divided into cuts, which are varied 
according to the animal, its size and the purpose for which the 
cut is to be used. 

The cost of meat is dependent on the local conditions and 
market prices. In general the more tender cuts are the most 

142 



143 



expensive but their nutritive value is no higher than that of the 
tough cuts. 

Meat should be removed from the paper as soon as it comes 
from the market and kept in a cool place. It should never stand 
in the open air exposed to dust and flies but should be kept 
covered. 

BEEF 

Beef is the meat most commonly used. It is in season all 
the year, its food value is high, and it is easy of digestion when 
well cooked. 

Tests for Good Beef 

1 Color — bright red after standing. 

2 Texture — fine-grained, firm. 

3 Juicy — not dry. 

4 Fat — straw-colored, abundant, distributed through the 

tissue of the meat. 

5 Bone not large in proportion to meat. 

6 Odor — slight but pleasant. 

7 Connective tissue not abundant. 

8 Cuts rnade across grain where possible. 

Because of the large size of the beef animal (450 to 600 
pounds for family use, 900 to 1000 pounds for hotel use) it is 
divided into many cuts that can be cooked in a great variety of 
ways. The housekeeper can secure variety for the table by 
makino; use of the various cuts.

Cuts of Beef 

The beef animal is divided down the middle of the back 
bone into two halves called sides, and each side is divided into 
two parts called quarters. 

THE FORE QUARTER 

The fore quarter is all that portion of the side lying in 
front of and including the last rib. In some markets the last 
rib is not included in the fore quarter. 

The "Shank"' or "Leg" is the first cut of the fore quarter. 
It is used for soup bone. The shank contains the "marrow 
bone" which is the middle portion of the shank bone. This is 
sometimes cooked and served on toast. 

The "Shoulder Clod" or "Round Shoulder Piece" is the 
next cut; this is divided into two cuts, each about three inches 
thick. The second or upper cut is best. The "Shoulder Clod" 
is used for pot-roast. 

The "Shoulder" contains two distinct layers of meat which 
are separated and boned, and used for cheap roasts, and pot- 
roasts. The inner portion of the shoulder from which the ribs 
are removed is the better. 

The "Brisket" is the cut just in front of the shoulder. The 
ends of five ribs are included in the brisket. The ribs are taken 



146 



out and the meat is sold as rolled roast, or corned and sold as 
boneless brisket. 

The "Knee Bone" just above the brisket is a round bone 
surrounded by much gelatin but contains little marrow. It is 
sold for soup. 

The "Neck" is used for stews, soup, and mince-meat. 

The diaphram which lies inside the fore-quarter separating 
the lungs from the intestines is called "Skirt Steak." It is 
removed whole, stuffed, rolled and braized, or cooked as pot- 
roast. 

The "Short Ribs" or "Cross Ribs" lie just above the bris- 
ket. They are divided into two narrow cuts which are used for 
roasting and are served with browned potatoes. 

The "Chuck Ribs" include the first six ribs back of the 
neck. They are sometimes trimmed for steaks or roasts, but 
make poor roasts; hence they are usually boned and rolled, and 
used in braizing, pot roasting, and stewing. 

The last seven ribs are called the "Prime Ribs" or "Short 
Ribs." They are used for choice roasts, the last five giving the 
best cuts. The sixth or seventh ribs contain some cartilage from 
the shoulder blade, and more connective tissue, hence are not so 
desirable. 

The "Navel End" lies just back of the brisket and shoul- 
der, and is used for soup meat, boiling, hash, or corning. 

The "Plate" which lies just above the navel and includes 
the lower portion of the ribs is used in the same ways as the 
navel. 

THE HIND QUARTER 

The hind quarter of beef is all that portion of the side 
lying back of the last rib. In some markets the last rib is 
included in the hind quarter. 

The "Flank Steak" is the first portion to be removed from 



147 



the hind quarter. It is a large flat muscle imbedded in fat. It 
is sold whole and is stuffed and rolled, or doubled up and 
braized. 

The "Tip of Flank" is the thick portion lying just back 
of plate, and is cut up for beef stews. 

Inside the hind quarter is the "Cod fat," a soft fat sur- 
rounding the muscles, used for beef drippings. 

The "Suet" is a hard fat w^hich lies about the kidneys, and 
is used for shortening, suet puddings, etc. 

The "Kidneys" lie embedded in the suet under the loin. 
There is one kidney in each hind quarter. The kidneys are pre- 
pared as a stew. 

The "Loin" which extends from the last rib to the rump is 
used for steaks and roasts. 

The "Club Steaks," "Short Steaks,," or "Delmonico Steaks" 
are the first cuts of the loin. If cut three inches thick there are 
just two club steaks. 

The "Porterhouse Steaks" lie back of the club steaks. They 
contain more fat and tenderloin than any of the other steaks. 
There are four or five Porterhouse steaks. 

The "Sirloin Steaks" lie back of the Porterhouse. 

The sirloin cuts include tw^o or three Pin-Bone Steaks, 
two Flat Bone Steaks(the most choice cuts of the Sirloin), and 
about three Round Bone Steaks. 

The "Tenderloin" lies under the bones of the loin. It is a 
long tapering muscle beginning just back of the ribs, and 
extending to the rump. It is usually included in the loin steaks 
but is also removed separately and used for broiling or roasting. 
It is a very expensive cut. 

The "Rump" lying just back of the loin is used for pot 
roasts and corned beef. The lower part of the rump towards the 
round contains poorer meat, and is sold for a lower price. 

The "Round" which lies just under the rump, is used 



148 



principally for steaks. It may be divided into as many as 
twenty-five steaks. It is also excellent to use in the preparation 
of beef tea. The "Upper Round" is the inner portion which al- 
wavs lies uppermost on the block. The "Lower Round" is the 
outer portion and rests against the block. 

The middle cut of the leg, called the "Horse Shoe Piece," is 
used for pot roasts and mince meat. 

The "Shank," or "Soup Bone," is the lower portion of the 
hind leg. 

The tail is used for soup. 

The bones which are removed in boning and trimming 
meat are scrapped and the small pieces of lean and fat are all 
used in Hamburg steak. 

As sold in the market the cuts are usually weighed before 
trimming. 

The bones are sold to the bone man and ground up for 
chicken food ; the waste fat is used for making soap. 

VEAL 

Veal is the name applied to the meat from the young calf 
of from 6 weeks to 9 months old. ]\Ieat from a younger animal 
is very unwholesome and its use is prohibited by law. "Bob- 
veal" is the name given to the flesh of a calf four weeks old — 
sometimes sold illegally. 

Not only the flesh but also the heart, tongue, liver, kidneys, 
sweetbreads, and brains of the veal are used as food. 

Veal is in season in the spring and early summer but can 
usually be obtained from the market throughout the year. 

Veal is not improved by long hanging but should be eaten 
soon after killing and dressing. In general the flesh of the 
young animal does not keep so long as that of the mature animal. 

The cuts of veal differ from those of beef, being fewer in 



149 



number. There are only six general cuts, tlie breast, shoulder, 
neck, leg, loin, and knuckles. 

The chuck portion is usually included in the shoulder and 
neck. 

The plate is included in the breast. 

The rump is included in the loin or leg. 

Chops are cut from the loin. 

Cutlets, steaks, fillet, and fricandeau or cushion are taken 
from the thick part of the leg. 

The rack includes all the ribs on both sides. 

Good veal should have a fine grained, pinkish colored flesh; 
clear, firm, white fat; and hard, good-sized bones. The meat 
of an animal which is too young is white and lacks in flavor. 
The same is true of an animal which has been bled before kill- 
ing. Veal which appears soft, flabby, gelatinous, blue, and 
watery is poor. 

Veal from a milk fed calf is best; that from a grass fed 
is poorest. 

Veal is never a cheap food. because of the large amount of 
fuel required to cook it thoroughly and the comparatively small 
amount of nourishment it contains. 

In composition veal is lacking in fats but is rich in protein 
and contans more gelatin than beef. It does not contain the 
valuable extractives present in beef. 

Veal is very unwholesome unless thoroughly cooked. 

Because it is lacking in fat, pork and other fats are fre- 
quently combined with it in cooking. 

It is well to accompany veal with rich, well-seasoned dres- 
sings; such seasonings as bay leaf, peppercorn, parsley and Wor- 
cestershire sauce are good additions. 

Veal is seldom served plain boiled because of its lack of 
flavor, but it is often used in well-seasoned stews. 

The general modes of cooking veal include: 



150 



Shoulder — Stew or roast. 

Neck — Stew or soup. 

Breast — Roast or stew. 

Leg — Cutlets for frying. 

Loin — Chops for broiling or roasts. 

Knuckles — Soup (most valuable in soup because of 
large amount of gelatine). 

Head — Soup. 
Veal is very difficult of digestion because of the tenacity of 
its fibers which renders it difficult of mastication. Because it 
is immature it is lacking in salts and flavor, and the flow of 
gastric juice is not excited. 

Veal ranks low among the heat producing foods because of 
lack of fat. Because of the difficulty of digesting it, it is not 
a valuable meat for food. 

MUTTON 

Mutton is the meat of sheep from three to five years old. 
The best English mutton is taken from a sheep six years old. 
Lamb is the meat of young sheep of from six wrecks to three 
months old. When one year old, lamb is spoken of as yearling. 
Mutton is raised throughout the United States. Mutton is mar- 
keted throughout the year. Spring lamb is in season through the 
spring and summer beginning with February and March. 

Mutton is hung from three to six weeks before using in 
order to ripen or develop flavor. 

Lamb should not be kept long after killing. 

Cuts of Mutton 

The animal is first split down the backbone, then divided 
into fore and hind quarters. 

There are usually six divisions of cuts of mutton — the neck, 
chuck, shoulder, flank, loin and leg, or, neck, shoulder, breast, 
rib chops, loin, and leg. 



151 



The loin and leg together are sometimes known as the 
haunch. 

The two loins, if not separated, form the saddle. The long 
saddle has the rump and tail left on; the short saddle consists 
only of the loins. 

The ribs and loin together form the rack. 

The small cuts from the ribs and loin are known as chops. 
Those from the last eight ribs nearest the loin are the best but 
all the rib chops have a large amount of waste and are very 
expensive cuts. 

French chops are rib chops with the end of the bone 
trimmed off. 

The leg is the most economical cut for a large family, as 
there is but little waste. 

The flesh of sheep is fine grained with a shorter fiber 
than beef. The meat from the grain or grass-fattened mutton 
has the best flavor. 

Good mutton should have a dull red or deep pink color; 
it should be firm to the touch but juicy. The fat should be 
abundant and be in little lines through the flesh. The fat is 
white, hard, and flaky containing a large per cent of stearin. 
There is usually a thick layer of fat on the back and legs. 
The bones should be small. 

Good lamb will be a little less firm than mutton, more 
whitish in color, but the flesh should be clear, the fat white. 

Lamb will be more fat than veal and mutton. 

The bones in lamb chops are more pink and flexible than 
in mutton. 

The bone at the leg joint in lamb is rough and serrated — 
in mutton it is smooth and round. 

Lamb is more expensive than mutton and the cuts are 
smaller with more waste. 

In chemical composition mutton closely resembles beef; 



152 



the per cent of fat in mutton may be higher than in beef. 

^Mutton requires more care in handling and cooking than 
beef. 

Improper cooking and low grade mutton have developed 
a strong prejudice against mutton with many people. 

If the thick, tough membrane just inside the outer skin 
enveloping the animal is left on, it gives a "wooly flavor" to 
the meat as the oil strikes through. This skin should be re- 
moved when the meat is prepared for cooking. 

Mutton is not liable to disease and mutton chops may be 
served rare. Though lamb is delicate and tender, it must be 
well-cooked to be wholesome. 

The meat of the fore-quarter or shoulder is boned and 
stuffed for roasting. 

The neck, breast, and flank are used for stews, pot pies,, 
and boiling. 

The neck is also used for broth. 

The portion above the hoof called "Sheep's Trotters" is 
used in Jellies, Pickling, and Sousing. 

The ribs, loin, leg, and rump may be used for roasting. 
The ribs and loin are more frequently cut into chops for broiling. 

The leg is one of the best roasts and is also excellent for 
boiling. 

To counteract the effect of the large amount of fat in 
mutton it is served with acid sauces — mint, caper, tomato, highly 
seasoned curry, etc. 

It is accompanied w^ith peas, asparagus, new potatoes, etc. 

Glutton ranks next to beef in food value and composition 
but is a little more difficult of digestion; if very fat, the mutton 
disagrees with some people. 

PORK 

Pork differs from other meats chiefly in the large amount 
of fat distributed through the muscular fiber. This renders- 



153 



the meat difficult of digestion and makes it a particular!}- valu- 
able food for cold weather and for those engaged in heavy 
muscular work. Pork must always be thoroughly cooked. Under 
no conditions should it be served rare. The fatty tissue of 
pork provides one of the most valuable fats for cooking pur- 
poses. 

COOKING OF MEATS 

When meat is to be used, it should be weighed, trimmed, 
and wiped with a cloth wrung out of cold water. 

Meat is cooked to develop the extractives, to improve the 
appearance, to soften the connective tissue, and to destroy germs. 

Methods of cooking include broiling, roasting or baking, 
braising or pot roasting, boiling or stewing, and soup making. 

Time for cooking meats will vary with the kind of meat, 
the cut used, the method of cooking employed, and the con- 
dition of the fiber. 

Dark meats may be served rare; light meats should always 
be well done. 

To Cook Tender Cuts of Meat 

Tender cuts of meat taken from the loin, ribs, or round 
are best cooked by dry heat because of the flavors developed. 

Broiling, pan-broiling and roasting are all methods of 
cooking by dry heat. 

When meat is to be cooked by any of these methods it is 
first seared by exposure to a high heat, then the temperature is 
slightly lowered and the meat is cooked at this temperature till 
done. By searing, the albumen on the outside of the meat is 
hardened forming a crust so that the juices of the meat cannot 
escape. 

To Cook Tough Cuts of Meat 

The tougher cuts of meat must be cooked l)y a moist heat 
for a long time slowly in order to soften and dissolve the con- 
nective tissue. 



154 



The methods of cooking by moist heat are known as: 

Braising or Pot Roasting — a small amount of water is 
used and the kettle is closely covered so that the steam is all 
retained. 

Boiling — a large quantity of boiling water is used so that 
the meat is entirely immersed. 

Stewing— the meat is cut up and covered with water which 
is flavored and seasoned and served with the meat. 

Soup-making — a large quantity of cold water is put over 
the meat, which is well cut up, the juices of the meat are ex- 
tracted, and only the stock is served. 

To Render or Try Out Fat 

Remove tough outside skin and lean parts from any animal 
fat and then cut into small pieces. Put fat into a sauce pan, 
cover with cold water and cook uncovered so that steam may 
carry oft" impurities. When water has all evaporated simmer to 
let fat fry out slowly from membrane. When fat is still and 
scraps of skin are all shrivelled, strain through a cloth and cool. 

To Clarify Fat 

Add a few slices of raw potato to fat when it is rather cool 
and heat it gradually until potato is well-browned. Strain 
through muslin or a double thickness of cheesecloth placed in 
a wire strainer. Cool quickly and then cover. 

To Wash Frying Kettle 

Wipe kettle out with new^spaper. Fill nearly full of water 
and add 1 tablespoon washing soda. Heat until water boils. 

Put in all the utensils that have been used in the fat. Then 
wash them thoroughly. 

Broiling 

Remove extra fat from the meat and grease the broiler 
with some of the fat. Place meat on broiler and broil directly 



155 



over a clear fire, searing first on each side and then turning 
every 10 seconds. Cook until well-puffed and brown. Season 
with salt, pepper and butter, and serve on a hot platter. Time 
for broiling varies with thickness of the meat. Cook a 1-inch 
steak 8 to 10 minutes; 1^-inch steak, 10 to 15 minutes; 2-inch 
steak, 15 to 20 minutes. 

Pan-Broiling 

Remove fat from the meat. Heat a frying pan smoking 
^ hot without adding any fat. Sear the meat on both sides, de- 
crease heat, then cook more slowly until done, turning every ten 
seconds. Stand chops on edge to brown. Keep the pan free 
from excess fat. The time for pan-broiling is the same as for 
broiling. 

Roasting 

Skewer meat in shape, lay it on a rack in a meat pan, 
season with salt and pepper, dredge with flour, and sear in a 
very hot oven. The oven should be hot enough to color a 
piece of unglazed white paper to golden brown in one minute. 
After ten minutes lower the heat of the oven and baste the 
meat every ten minutes with fat from the pan. 

Time for Roasting 

Rib Roast, Rare 10-12 min. per lb. 

Rib Roast, Well done • 18-20 min. per lb. 

Rolled Roast, Rare 12-15 min. per lb.

Boiled Meat 

To boil meat place a compact piece of meat in boiling 
water and allow the w^ater to boil for 10 to 15 minutes, then 
simmer until tender. All tough meat may be made tender if 
cooked in this way. Time for cooking meat in water varies 
with the weight and quality of meat; allow 20 minutes to the^ 
pound, and 20 minutes extra for a large piece.

LIVER 

The livers of many animals are used for food. Those of 
the beef, calf, and lamb are most commonly used. 

The liver is one of the cheap animal foods unless there is a 
great demand for it, then the price is higher. 

Liver is solid and compact in form and contains but little 
connective tissue, though a tough skin covers it and the veins 
which pass through it have very tough walls. 

In preparing liver it is necessary to wash and scald it 
thoroughly and to remove the outer skin and veins carefully. 
There is but little waste. 

Liver is sauted, stewed, and baked. If cooked too long it 
toughens. 

It is well to serve liver with an accompaniment of heat- 
producing foods — hence, it is usually accompanied by bacon and 
starchy food such as potato and flour grav>'. 

Liver is rather difficult of digestion because so compact 
in form. 

Its nutritive value is high — rather higher than that of 
muscular tissue. 



164 



To Cook Liver 

Cover slices of liver cut Yz inch thick with boiling water, 
let stand 5 minutes, drain, wipe, and remove the thin outside 
skin and veins carefully with a knife. Sprinkle w^ith salt and 
pepper, dredge with flour, and cook until brown in bacon fat. 

BACON 

Bacon is prepared from the flanks of pork, salted, dried, 
and smoked. 

Bacon is an expensive form of food. 

Sliced and packed in jars it is still more expensive and 
only desirable when bacon in the strips will not keep wtII. 

Bacon consists largely of fat, though it contains some layers 
of lean or muscular tissue. 

Before cooking bacon the rind should be removed, all ex- 
posed surfaces scraped wdth a knife and the bacon sliced in thin 
even slices for cooking. 

Bacon is broiled, pan-broiled, and baked in the oven. It 
should be cooked until crisp so that it can be readily acted upon 
by the digestive juices. 

Next to butter and cream bacon is the most easily digested 
of animal fats. It is easily assimilated and very nutritious. 

To Cook Bacon 

Place thin slices of bacon (from which the rind has been 
removed) in a hot frying pan and pour off the fat as fast as it 
comes out. When the bacon is crisp, drain on paper. Keep 
hot. Or lay bacon on a rack in a baking pan and bake in a hot 
oven until crisp. 

SWEETBREADS 

Sweetbread is the term applied to the thymus gland of the 
calf. This gland becomes so changed as not to be edible when 



165 



the animal grows older; in some animals it may eventually be 
absorbed. 

The sweetbread is obtained in pairs because there are two 
parts of the thymus gland which are connected by tubing and 
membrane. That portion known as the heart sw^eetbread lies 
over the heart; it is short and thick. The throat sweetbread is 
long and narrow and runs up into the throat. It contains more 
membrane than the heart sweetbread and is not so desirable. 

The pancreas, -known as the stomach sweetbread, is often 
substituted for the true sweetbreads. It is more compact and 
not so delicate as true sweetbreads. Calves' brains are also often 
substituted for sweetbreads. Pork sweetbreads are sometimes 
substituted for calves sweetbreads but they are coarse, dark, and 
undesirable. 

Sweetbreads are in season in the spring and summer when 
veal is most abundant. Though they can be obtained at other 
seasons they are usually not so good. 

The sweetbreads are removed frcm the veal before it is cut 
up. If they are not to be used at once they are placed in cold 
storage. 

Sweetbreads should be white, firm, and plump. Those from 
the milk-fed calf are best. If dark, flabby, and tough the sweet- 
breads have been taken from an improperly fed animal. 

Sweetbreads are cheapest in the summer time. In some mar- 
kets they are sold by the pair but they are frequently sold by the 
pound. 

Sweetbreads are cellular organs, much more delicate than 
the muscle fiber. The connective tissue which surrounds them 
can be easily removed after they are parboiled and the sweet- 
bread is readily divided into sections. 

Sweetbreads should be parboiled as soon as they come from 
the market; they may then be kept from 30 to 40 hours if kept 
very cold. 



166 



Before cooking it is always necessary to soak sweetbreads 
one-half to one hour in cold water in order to draw out all the 
blood w^hich may darken them when cooked. The pipes, fat, 
and all bruised portions must be cut away before cooking. 

To parboil sweetbreads plunge them in boiling water and 
boil gently 15 to 20 minutes. 

In order to blanch sw^eetbreads more perfectly a little lemon 
juice or vinegar is often added to the water in parboiling. 

Onions and spices are sometimes added to the water in 
parboiling to improve the flavor. 

After parboiling, the sweetbreads should be plunged in cold 
water to quickly cool so that they will be firm. 

The methods of cooking sweetbreads are creaming, broiling, 
breading and frying, baking, and parboiling for use in salads. 

Sometimes the sweetbreads are left in the breast and cooked 
with the roast of veal. 

The delicate flavor of the sweetbreads must always be 
borne in mind in cooking and seasoning them. 

Sweetbreads are among the most easily digested foods. 
Their digestion takes place very quickly because the connective 
tissue which they contain is readily dissolved in the stomach. 
As the gland itself contains some digestive ferment, sweetbreads 
may be said to be partly self-digesting. 

While sweetbreads may be classed with meats among the 
protein foods they are not so stimulating as meats because 
they are lacking in extractives. 

Because of the ease with which sweetbreads can be di- 
gested and because of their high nutritive value they are a 
valuable dish in the diet of a convalescent. 

To Cook Sweetbreads 

Remove sweetbreads from paper at once, soak in cold 
water 30 minutes and parboil 20 minutes. Add 1 teaspoon salt 



167 



5 minutes before they are done. Put them in cold water for 
15 minutes, then remove the tough portions. Broil, fry, cream, 
or use the boiled sweetbreads in salads as desired. 

Creamed Sweetbreads 

1 pound or 1 pair of sweetbreads, boiled. 
5 large mushrooms (half as many canned mush- 
rooms as there are sweetbreads). 
2 tablespoons butter Cayenne 

2 tablespoons flour White pepper 

%. teaspoon salt 1 cup cream or milk 

Cut the boiled sweetbreads into small pieces and chop the 
mushrooms fine. Make a white sauce of butter, flour, season- 
ings, and cream. Add the sweetbreads and the mushrooms and 
when hot serve in patty dishes or timbales or on toast. If de- 
sired, the mushrooms may be omitted and twice as many sweet- 
breads used. A few drops of onion juice improve the flavor. 
Serves 8 to 10. 

Calf's Brains 

1 pair calf's brains 2 sprigs thyme 

2 cups w^ater or meat stock 2 tablespoons vinegar

water or stock with cloves, peppercorns, th^-me, vinegar and 
salt. Simmer gently one half hour. Drain and cool in cold 
water. When cold cut in dice and add to white sauce. Flavor 
with onion juice. Serve en toast. Serves 6 or 8. 

RULES FOR COOKING OVER MEATS 

Meat which is to be cooked over should be carefully 
treated in reheating to prevent it becoming too dry. Water or 
stock must be added to provide moisture. The meat must be 
well-seasoned and attractively garnished to make it appetizing. 



168 



If the meat is to be cut up, all fat, gristle, bone, and skin 
must be carefully removed and the meat evenly chopped or cut 
in uniform pieces of attractive size. 

Cooked over meats should be accompanied by well-seasoned 
sauces. Many attractive entrees can be prepared with cold 
cooked meat as a basis. 

All small pieces of cooked meat should be saved, and 
utilized in this way or added with the bone, skin, and gristle, to 
the stock pot. All fat should be utilized for drippings or for 
soap.

POULTRY 

Poultry is the term given to the domestic birds used as 
food and includes fowls and chickens, turkeys, tame ducks and 
geese. A chicken which is more than one year old is known as 
a fowl. A chicken which is not more than five months old is 
known as a "spring chicken." 

Fowls are always in market but are cheapest through the 
W' inter when they are not laying eggs. Chickens (spring) are in 
market through the summer and fall. 

A chicken is known by the soft feet, smooth skin, and soft 
cartilage at the end of the breast bone. An abundance of fine 
feathers indicates a young bird, while the presence of long 
hairs denotes age. In a fowl the feet have become hard and dry 
with coarse scales, and the cartilage at the end of the breast- 
bone is ossified. 

In fowls which have been picked without scalding the skin 
is in much better condition. 

The flesh of chickens, fowls, and turkeys has a short fiber 
and is not intermingled with fat. The fat is always found under 
the skin in layers or in masses surrounding the intestines. The 
breast meat in fowls and turkeys has a short, tender fiber, the 
meat on the legs is darker and has more flavor. The meat of 
fowls has more flavor than that of young chickens. 

Poultry that is to be kept for some time should first be 
drawn and cleaned and kept very cold. After having been 
frozen the flesh loses flavor and spoils very rapidly when thawed. 

Young chickens are broiled and fried; fowls are stewed, 
braized and roasted. Poultry is very nutritious and is easily 
digested if not too fat. The white meat is especially easy of 
digestion.

To Dress and Clean Poultry 

Singe the fowl to remove long hairs by holding over a flame 
from gas, alcohol, or burning paper. Cut off the head, turn 
back the skin and cut the neck off quite close; take out the 
wind pipe and crop, cutting off close to the body. Cut through 
the skin around the leg !^ inch below the leg joint, take out 
the tendons, and separate the leg at the joint; in old birds each 
tendon must be removed separately by using a skewer. Remove 
pin feathers with the point of a knife. Remove oil-bag from the 
tail. To remove the internal organs make an opening under 
one of the legs, or at the vent, and remove them carefully, leav- 
ing a strip of skin above the vent, The intestines, gizzard, 
heart and liver should all be removed together; care must be 
taken that the gall bladder, which lies under the liver, be not 
broken; it must be carefully cut away from the liver. The 
lungs and the kidneys lying in the hollows of the backbone must 
be carefully removed. Press the heart to extract any blood. 
Take off the outer coat of the gizzard, and discard the sack 
within. The gizzard, heart, and liver constitute the giblets, 
and can be used for making gra\y. Wash the giblets, put the 
heart and gizzard in cold water, heat quickly, and cook slowly 
1 hour, then add the liver and cook until all are tender, about 3^ 
hour longer. Cleanse the fowl by wiping thoroughly inside 
and out with a damp cloth. Stuff and truss for roasting, or cut 
into pieces for stew or fricassee. 

Roast Fowl 

After a fowl has been dressed and cleaned fill with stuffing, 
truss securely in compact shape, and lay on its back on a rack 
in a roasting pan. Dredge with flour, salt, and pepper, dot 
with bits of butter and place in a hot oven. As soon as the 
flour is browned, begin to baste with a cup of hot water, and 2 
tablespoons fat, and baste every 10 minutes. 



172 



Cook until breast is tender — V/y hours for a four-pound 
fowl. For a large fowl or an old fowl, the time must be in- 
creased. 

Stuffing for Roast Fowl 

4 cups bread crumbs ^ cup melted butter or 

2 teaspoons salt other fat 

y^. teaspoon pepper 7^ cup boiling water 

1 teaspoon poultr}^ seasoning 1 egg, (if desired) 
Mix in the order given, combine thoroughly and use to 
stuff fowls and turkeys. If a &ry, crumbly dressing is desired 
omit the boiling w'ater. The addition of the egg makes a 
richer dressing. 

To Carve a Fowl 

The first requisite in successful carving of a fowl is that 
the carver have a knowledge of the location of all the bones and 
joints. A sharp carving knife is an absolute necessity. 

It is desirable to have an extra plate and fork at the carver's 
place, the plate to hold the joints as they are removed, the 
fork to use in dividing the joints. 

When sent to the table the fowl should be on its back on 
the platter w^ith the legs at the right hand of the carver. 

The first thing to be done is to put the carving fork in the 
breast, just a little below the point of the breast, pressing it 
down firmly so that the tines are on either side of the breast 
bone just above the wish-bone. The fork must be held there 
all through the carving and the fowl must not be moved. 

There is a rule that the wings of a bird which flies must 
be removed first, the legs of a bird that walks. Remove both 
joints on one side first. 

To Remove Leg — Holding the fork in the left hand, press 
back the leg on the nearer side of the body, then cut down 
through the skin and joint right across the joint so that some 
meat will be left on the hip bone. 



173 

To Remove Wing — Cut through the joint taking same 
white meat from the breast with the wing. Then if there are 
many persons to be served so that the greater part of the fowl 
will be needed, remove the leg and the wing on the farther side. 

Carve the white meat on the breast, slicing it off carefully 
in thin cross slices; when down almost to the breast bone, dis- 
joint and remove the wish-bone with the remaining white meat. 

Turn the body to one side, cut off the dark meat left at the 
base of the leg joint, then cut out the oyster, a choice piece of 
dark meat on the lower side part of the back and close to 
either side of the backbone. With it remove the skin and meat 
from the shoulder blade. 

Then at last remove the fork and separate the pieces which 
lie along the side of the breast bone where the fork has been 
held. 

Open the front of the fowl so that the dressing can be re- 
moved with a spoon. 

To Separate the Joints — Separate the second joint from the 
drum-stick. Notice the white mark where the fibers join at the 
joint (for they run in distinctly different directions) and cut 
through the mark right between the bones that meet at the joint. 

Small pieces of meat may be removed from the side of the 
second joint. The second joint is considered the most juicy and 
best flavored cut in the fowl. 

The meat may be carefully cut from the drum stick and it 
will then be more enjoyed. If the tendons have been removed, 
the meat on the drum stick is very good. 

Serve the cuts as attractively as possible, particularly if 
the meat is served cold. Lay the pieces skin side up. In 
serving put pieces of both light and dark meat on each plate. 

To Cut up a Fowl for Stew, Fricassee or Frying 

After singeing the fowl and removing the head, feet, and 
oil sack, cut off the legs, and separate at the joint into drum 



174 



sticks and second joint. Cut off the wings and separate them at 
the middle joint. Separate the body by cutting carefully between 
the breast and the back through the ends of the ribs on either 
side. Disjoint the neck-piece from the breast. Separate the neck- 
piece from the end of the back and carefully lift out all the en- 
trails lying in the back. Remove the kidneys from the back 
and the lungs from the neck-piece, and wash these two cuts 
thoroughly. 

Separate the wish-bone, with the meat that is on it, from 
the breast. Cut the breast across in two pieces with the cleaver. 
This will give thirteen cuts. If the breast is large it may be 
further divided. The neck may be cooked with the giblets and 
used in making gravy. 

Cuts of Fowl 

2 drum sticks 1 end of neck 

2 second joints of legs 2 cuts of breast 

2 wings 1 wishbone piece 

2 second joints of wings 1 gizzard

Stewed Fowl 

After cleaning and cutting up the fowl, cover pieces with 
boiling water, and cook rapidly 15 minutes. Then add 1 table- 
spoon salt, and cook at low temperature until tender, 1^ 
hours or more.

175 



Cook until smooth and thickened, then pour on two well- 
beaten egg yolks, add chopped parsley, and pour over fowl 
which has been attractively arranged on a hot platter. 

To arrange bird on platter lay neck, breast, and back in 
center in order. On the sides of the breast, lay cuts of wings, 
on the sides of the back lay drum sticks and second joints. 
Lay giblets between wings and second joints. Serves 6 to 10.

FISH 

The flesh of fish is used for food; the cavdar, which is the 
salted roe or spawn of the sturgeon, shad roe, and the coral or 
ovaries of lobsters are all considered delicacies. 

The season for fish varies with different kinds. All fish are 
best before spawning, as during the spawning season the flesh 
grows poor and flabby. The season for catching fish is de- 
termined by law in order to avoid their extermination. 

Fish is cheapest when in season and near the source of 
supply. It is sold by the pound or by the whole fish or in cutlets. 

The flesh of fish is made up of little fine flakes with con- 
nective tissue bindings that gelatinize very easily, hence fall 
apart when cooked. 

Preparation and Cooking — Fish should be perfectly fresh; 
flesh firm and elastic; eyes bright; and odor good. 

Keep fish cold until used, in a covered pail near the ice 
covered. If fish is frozen, thaw, just before using, by placing in 
or with chopped ice, never with the other food unless tightly 
in cold water. 

Cover board or table with newspaper before laying fish 
down. Remove scales by running a dull knife from tail to 
head, snapping scales off. Wet hands before touching fish, 
and odor will come off more easily. Dip hands in salt so that 
fish will not slip, and hold by the tail. 

If inner organs have not been removed in market, make a 
short incision in belly, draw them out carefully so that the mem- 
brane which lines the cavity is not broken. 

Remove head, if desired; if left on, cut out eyes. 

Remove fins with scissors. Cleanse inside and out with 
cloth wet in salted water. . 

Sprinkle fish with salt if to be kept over night. 

Handle fish carefully when cooking, as flesh falls apart 

178 



179 



easily, and have all utensils well-greased, as skin sticks readily 
when heated. 

When fish is cooked the flesh separates from the bone. 

Cold cooked fish may be used in various ways as creamed, 
scalloped, souffled, etc. It must be carefully picked over, all 
skin and bone removed, and flaked with a silver fork. 

Serving — The seasoning and garnishing of fish are impor- 
tant because fish is lacking in extractives and flavor and is of 
so alkalin a nature. Acid accompaniments, sauces, or stuffings 
are used with fish. A rich stuffing is desirable with dry fish. 
Potato in some form is usually served with fish. 

Boiled fish is spread with butter and lemon juice, and 
served with a garnish of lemon slices, hard cooked eggs, parsley, 
and potatoes. Baked fish is served with tomato sauce or drawn 
butter sauce. 

Baked fish is carved by running the knife down along the 
back bone, slicing pieces to the bone, and lifting the meat off. 

Boiled or steamed fish is served wath sliced lemon, sliced 
eggs, parsley sprays and chopped parsley and is accompanied 
by Hollandaise sauce or drawn butter sauce. 

Broiled Fish 

Clean the fish, cut in pieces, lay on a well-greased broiler. 
If the fish is dry, rub it with melted butter before placing it on 
the broiler. Sear the flesh side first, then turn every ten seconds. 
The length of time for cooking depends on thickness of the fish 
— 20 to 30 minutes. Season with butter, salt, and pepper. 

Baked Fish 

Clean the fish, sprinkle with salt, and fill with stuffing, 
sew or skewer the edges together. Cut gashes on each side 
across the fish, and put strips of salt pork into them. Fold a 
piece of w^ll-buttered paper about the tail. Grease the baking 
sheet and place the fish on it, dredge with flour, salt and pepper, 



180 



put the sheet into a baking pan with pieces of pork fat. Place 
in a hot oven. Baste every 10 minutes. Cook 15 minutes to 
the pound, and 15 minutes over. Add water to the pan if 
necessary. 

Stuffing for Fish 

2 cups stale bread crumbs 1 teaspoon chopped parsley 

^ teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon capers or 

ys teaspoon white pepper chopped pickle 

Cayenne % cup melted butter 

1 teaspoon onion juice 

Mix in the order given. 

Steamed or Boiled Fish 

Clean the fish, lay on a buttered plate in a steamer over 
gently-boiling water; or place it in a piece of muslin, sew or tie 
the edges together, and put the fish into boiling water, boil 5 
minutes, then add 1 tablespoon salt and cook at a lower tem- 
perature until done. Boil or steam 20 minutes to the pound. 
Serve with sauce. 

Fried Fish 

Clean the fish, cut in fillets, season with salt and pepper, 
and cover with corn meal and flour (mixed in equal parts), or 
fine bread crumbs, and egg. Cook in deep fat or saute. Drain 
on paper. See Directions for Cooking in Deep Fat. 

Planked Fish 

Clean the fish well. Split down the back, removing the 
backbone. Wipe dry. Rub a fish plank well with salt and heat 
it very hot in the oven. Dredge the fish with salt and pepper. 
Spread the fish open, skin side down on the board. Overlap 
the thin flesh of the back. Nail the four ends to the board. 
Baste with melted butter. Put under the gas in the broiler. 
Have the burner turned on full; when the fish is a good brown 
lower the blaze and cook the fish slowlv one-half hour. When 



181 



the fish is cooked spread with butter; garnish the board with 
a potato border. Brown the potatoes in the oven. Garnish 
with sliced lemon and parsley. Serve at once.

OYSTERS 

Oysters are in season from September to May — through the 
months containing "r." In the summer months the oysters are 
spawning and are not considered good. 



184 



Oysters are often "fattened" or "soaked" in fresh water 
before being sent to market. This involves a loss in nutritive 
value. Along the coast oysters are sold in the shell. For ship- 
ping some distance the shells are usually opened and the oysters 
packed in bulk, sealed and surrounded by ice for shipping. 
Some are packed in tin boxes. Oysters must always be kept 
ver}' cold. 

The oysters are always considered best if bought in the 
shell where it is possible to obtain them in that way. Blue 
points are a small oyster raised on Long Island, thought to have 
an especially line flavor. Bulk oysters are good for stews, 
scallops, and creamed oysters. Select oysters, those large in 
size, are best for frying. 

The oyster consists of a soft portion or body which is 
principally the liver (glycogen) and a tough portion, or muscle, 
and is surrounded by gills. The entire body is used for food. 

After oysters have been removed from the shell, they 
should always be carefully picked over to remove any small 
pieces of shell and should be well-washed. If the juice is to be 
served, it should be strained through a cheese cloth. 

Purpose of cooking oysters: 

1 To make them more attractive. 

2 To develop flavor. 

3 To make them more wholeson-e. 

Methods of cooking include broiling, pan-broiling, frying, 
stewing, creaming, scalloping. 

Oysters should be cooked a very few minutes. Test — when 
the body looks plump and the edges curl. If oysters are cooked 
too long, the flavor is lost and the muscle becomes tough. 

Appropriate garnishes for oysters are lemon, parsley, cel- 
ery, and such relishes as catsup and horse-radish. 



185 



Fricasseed Oysters 

2 tablespoons butter Cayenne 

1 teaspoon salt 1 pint or 30 oysters 

yi teaspoon white pepper 
Place all the ingredients, except the oysters, in a chafing 
dish or covered sauce-pan. When hot add the oysters, cover 
and shake the pan occasionally. When the oysters are plump 
and edges curl, drain them and place them where they will 
keep hot. Add enough cream to the liquid in the pan to make 
1 cup and use this for the sauce. 

Sauce 

2 tablespoons butter 1 cup cream and oyster 

3 tablespoons flour liquid 

Salt and pepper 1 teaspoon lemon juice 

1 egg 

Cook the ingredients, except the egg and lemon juice, as 
a white sauce. Beat the egg until light, and pour the hot 
sauce gradually over it. Add the oysters and lemon juice, and 
when hot serve on toast or in patty-dishes. Serves 6 to 8. 

Broiled Oysters 

30 oysters ^ cup cream or milk 

1^ tablespoons butter ^ cup oyster juice 

1^ tablespoons flour Salt and pepper 

6 slices of toast 
Wash, drain, and dry the oysters. Grease a griddle or 
oyster broiler with 1 teaspoon butter. When hot put in oysters 
and turn when the edges curl. Remove the oysters to a hot 
plate, melt remainder of butter, add flour and seasonings and 
then liquid. When well-cooked add oysters. Serve hot on 
toast. 

Fried Oysters 

Large Oysters Dried bread crumbs (sifted and 
Egg seasoned )

them dry, season with salt and pepper, roll in bread crumbs and 
flour, dip in egg (beaten with 1 tablespoon water or oyster 
juice), and again in crumbs. Fry in deep fat 1 minute, drain, 
garnish and serve. 

Scalloped Oysters 

1 pint or 30 oysters Cayenne 

3 cups bread crumbs 3 tablespoons butter 

3/2 teaspoon salt % cup oyster juice 

Wash the oysters with cold water in a colander, and re- 
move pieces of shell with the fingers. Strain the juice, which is 
to be used, through a cheesecloth. 

Melt the butter, add the crumbs and seasonings. 

Line the bottom of a buttered baking dish with V^ the 
crumbs and then add j/2 the oysters. 

Add 54 rnore crumbs and the remainder of the oysters and 
the oyster juice. Cover with the buttered crumbs. Bake in a 
moderate oven 30 to 40 minutes. 

If baked in individual dishes, 4 cups crumbs and 4 tea- 
spoons butter should be used and the oysters should be cut up. 
Bake 15 minutes. Serves 6 or 8. 



COOKING IN FATS 

Fats are considered a desirable medium for cooking some 
foods because they can be heated to so high a temperature and 
cook the food very quickly. When cooked in fats some foods 
develop special flavors and a peculiar palatability. 

Methods of cooking in fats include sauteing — cooking in a 
small amount of fat; and frying — cooking by means of immer- 
sion in deep fat at a temperature of 350 to 400 degrees. 

Salad oil, lard, and beef drippings are excellent fats for 
cooking, and there are many good cooking fats on the market 
that are made of a combination of vegetable and animal fats. 
Fats are an expensive food for cooking purposes, but there is 
a wide range in the prices for which they can be obtained. The 
housekeeper should know all the cooking fats obtainable and 
she should keep informed as to the local prices. 

Necessary Utensils for Deep Fat Frying Include: — 

1 An iron frying kettle of good depth so that fat will 
not easily bubble over. The kettle should never be filled within 
more than two inches of the top. A Scotch bowl is ex:cellent 
because it can be easily handled and, because of its rounding 
base, so large an amount of fat is not required to fill it. 

2 A fr}4ng basket to hold articles when placed in kettle 
so that they will not be broken up. 

3 A long fork with which to handle basket. Or, a flat 
wire egg beater can be used in place of the basket and long fork. 

4 Unglazed absorbent paper for draining. 

Changes in Fat When Heated 

When fat is heated it bubbles because of water present, 
which passes off as steam when it reaches a temperature of 212 
degrees. The fat grows but little hotter until the water is all 
evaporated, then it becomes quiescent, temperature rises rapidly, 

187 



188 



a faint blue smoke is given off of some fats, then heavy fumes 
arise and finally the fat boils at a temperature of about 600 
degrees. The fat is hot enough for most cooking purposes when 
the faint blue smoke begins to rise, but for deep fat frying 
definite tests must be used. See "Tests for Temperature" given 
below. 

In cooking, the boiling point of fats is never used. Most 
animal fats are broken up before the boiling point is reached 
and the substances associated with the fats, or cooked in them, 
would be burned at a temperature even lower than the 
boiling point. 

Temperature for Frying 

The fat must be hot enough to form a crust quickly on 
the articles to be fried so that the food will not absorb fat. 
This temperature must be varied for different substances in 
accordance with the length of time which it is necessary to 
cook them through. 

Tests for Temperature 

When water has all been evaporated from fat and bubbling 
has entirely ceased, watch carefully for a faint blue smoke. 
Then test by dropping in a small cube of bread or a little of the 
food material that is to be fried. 

If one can count 60 seconds while the bread is browning 
the fat is hot enough for uncooked mixtures such as potatoes, 
doughnuts, fritters, etc. 

If one can count 40 seconds while the bread is browning 
the fat is hot enough for all previously cooked mixtures, such 
as croquettes, fish balls, etc., that will be quickly cooked. 

If one can count 20 seconds while the bread is browning 
the fat is hot enough for oysters and other foods that are to be 
cooked very quickly. 



189 



During the time of counting the bread should become a 
golden brown. 

If a black smoke comes from the fat it is too hot. 
Method of Frying 

The articles to be fried should be warm and dry and only 
a few should be put in the fat at a time. 

When the fat is at the proper temperature slip a few of 
the articles to be fried carefully into the kettle. Stir or turn if 
necessary and cook until the crust is a golden brown, and the 
mixture has had time to cook through to the center; then re- 
move from the fat. 

When cooked, drain the articles a few minutes directly 
over the kettle, then lay on unglazed paper, so that fat which 
adheres to the article will be absorbed by the paper. Reheat 
fat before adding another quantity of food to be fried. 

Time Table for Frying 

Breaded Chops 5 to 8 min. Fritters 3 to 5 min. 

Croquettes 1 min. Oysters 1 min. 

Doughnuts 3 to 5 min. Potatoes, raw 4 to 8 min. 

Fish Balls 1 min. 

Many kinds of food may be fried in the same fat. Each 

time after using clarify the fat, chill, and keep for future use. 

Use new fat for potatoes first, then flour mixtures and crumbed 

articles, and lastly for fish foods. When fat has grown so 

dark that it is no longer good for frying, it can be utilized in 

making soap. 

Fat burns so readily that special precautions must be ob- 
served in handling it so that it does not come in contact with 
the flame. 

If the fat bubbles over on the stove it should be quickly 
wiped off with newspaper. 

If the fat should take fire, cover it quickly with ashes or 
sprinkle salt on it.

^SSin? and Crumbing 

Many foods do not become covered with a crust when 
subjected to high heat in deep fat. Such foods must have some 
egg added to the mixture or be coated with a substance which 
forms a crust quickly. For this reason foods are dipped into 
bread crumbs and eggs, a method known as egging and crumb- 
ing. 

Dried crumbs are prepared from crusts and from small 
pieces of hard bread dried in a very moderate oven until a 
light brown. Roll them on a pastry board, or put them through 
a meat grinder. Sift the crumbs. Keep dried crumbs in jars, 
tie pieces of muslin over jars and keep in a dry place. Use 
them to cover articles of food to be cooked in deep fat. For 
savory dishes it is well to season crumbs with salt and pepper. 

Steps in egging and crumbing: 

1 Dip article into seasoned dried bread crumbs, flour, or 
corn meal, covering it entirely with crumbs. 

2 Dip into egg which has been slightly beaten with 1 
tablespoon water, milk, or oyster juice (for fried oysters). 

3 Dip again into seasoned bread crumbs. 

Reasons for steps in egging and crumbing for deep fat 
frying: 

The article is dipped into bread crumbs 

1 To make the surface dry. 

2 To cause the egg to adhere. 
The article is dipped into egg 

1 To cause a crust to form on the surface. 

2 To prevent fat soaking in. 

Water is added to the egg(l tablespoon to each egg) 

1 To prevent its becoming dry and strings*. 

2 To prevent cracking of the crust. 
The egg is beaten slightly 

1 To mix it well and break up the membrane. 



191 



2 To avoid large bubbles in cooking, as they might 
crack and admit fat. 
The article is dipped in crumbs the second time 

1 To make the surface dry so that the fat will not 
bubble so vigorously. 

2 To improve appearance and flavor of the crust. 

Croquettes 

Croquettes are an attractive form in which to serve left- 
overs. They are used for a luncheon dish or as an entree at 
dinner. 

The ingredients used in croquettes are usually already 
cooked and are finely cut up. They are well-seasoned and are 
bound together wdth egg, softened bread crumbs, or a thick 
white sauce made of 2 tablespoons butter, 4 tablespoons flour, 
and 1 cup milk. 

The materials which may serve as a foundation are: — 
Meat — Chicken, Veal, Beef. 
Fish — Salmon, Lobster, Cod, Oysters. 
Vegetable — ^lacaroni, Potato, Squash, Parsnips. 
Cereal — Rice, Farina. 
Fruit — Banana, Apple. 
Egg — Hard cooked, creamed, stuffed. 
Cheese — With butter, with eggs, with white sauce. 
The processes involved in making croquettes are mixing, 
seasoning and binding materials; chilling; shaping — round for 
cereals, cylindrical for potatoes, pyramid for meats; crumbing, 
egging and crumbing; frying and draining. See — Directions for 
cooking in deep fat. 

Croquettes may be served with a garnish of parsley, peas, 
or with sauces — white sauce, tomato sauce, brown sauce, mush- 
room sauce, or with sweet sauce for fruit croquettes. 
See recipes for croquettes. 



BATTERS AND DOUGHS 

Batters and doughs are mixtures of flour or meal and a 
liquid, with salt and sugar to give flavor, butter to make ten- 
der, and air or gas to make light. Doughs are thicker than 
batters. 

Flour and water mixed and cooked make a hard mass. 
Air or gas can be introduced and the mixture quickly cooked 
before the bubbles break and the resulting cooked dish will 
be light and porous, because of the elastic nature of the flour 
and its tendency to become firm when exposed to high heat. 
The air and gas both expand when heated at the temperature 
of the oven to about three times their volume, and if properly 
baked the cooked dish is very light. 

Methods of entangling air in a batter: 

1 By beating the batter. Examples — Pop-overs, cream 
puffs, beaten biscuits. 

2 By kneading the batter. Examples — Bread and rolls. 

3 By adding well-beaten eggs. Examples — Pop-overs, 
muffins, cakes. (One or two eggs are sufficient to 
make one cup flour light in a thin batter, 6 eggs are 
necessary for 1 cup flour if no other liquid is used.) 

Methods of Entangling Gas in a Batter: 
1 By using an alkali with an acid. 

a Soda with sour milk. (1 teaspoon soda to 1 pint 

sour milk.) 
b Soda with molasses. (1 teaspoon soda to 1 cup 

molasses. ) 
c Soda with cream of tartar. ( 1 level teaspoon soda 

to 2 slightly rounding teaspoons cream of tartar.) 
d Soda with dried fruits. (Raisins containing cream 

of tartar.) 
e Soda with chocolate (fatt>' acids). 

192 



193 
2 By the use of yeast. 

The Thickness of Batters and Doughs 

1 A thin or pour batter is of the cc-nsistency of thin cream 
and pours readily. 

Proportion— 1 measure flour to 1 measure liquid (scant). 
Example — Pop-overs, griddle cakes, timbales, etc. 

2 A thick cake, or drop batter is of the consistency of 
thick cream and breaks when poured. 

Proportion — 2 measures flour to 1 measure liquid. Ex- 
ample — Muffins, butter cakes, etc. 

3 A soft or bread dough is stiff enough to be handled 
lightly. 

Proportion — 3 measures flour to 1 measure liquid. Ex- 
ample — Baking powder biscuits, bread, etc. 

4 A stiff or pastry dough is stiff enough to be handled 
easily. 

Proportion — 4 measures flour to 1 measure liquid. Ex- 
ample — Pie crust, cheese straws, noodles, etc. 

Note — Proportions will vary with the kind of flour and 
the liquid used. 

Ways of Combining Ingredients 

1 To stir, merely for the purpose of combining in- 
gredients, means to mix by circular motion with a spoon. 

2 To beat, for the purpose of enclosing air in the mix- 
ture, means turning the ingredients over and over, and draw- 
ing the spoon, fork or beater through from underneath to the 
surface. 

3 To cut and fold, for the purpose of combining in- 
gredients which have alread}' been beaten in such a way as to 
prevent the entangled air from escaping, means cutting through 
and turning over the ingredients with a fork or beater until 
they are thoroughly blended. 



194 



General Directions for Mixing Batters 

1 Have oven at proper temperature, and see that the fire 
is in good condition and well regulated. The oven temperature 
should be about 375 degrees, or test by putting in a piece of 
white paper or 2 teaspoons flour on a pan. This should become 
a golden brown in from 2 to 5 minutes. 

2 Prepare pans before beginning to measure materials. 
Grease pans with lard, butter, or beef drippings, using a 

soft brush or a piece of paper for that purpose. Heat iron gem 
pans or earthen cups before filling. 
Pans are greased 

a To keep batter from sticking. 

b To add flavor to the crust. 

c To help cook the crust. 

3 Have all materials measured and ready before begin- 
ning to combine the ingredients. 

4 Mix and sift all dry ingredients together. 

5 Mix milk and egg yolk. 

6 Add liquids slowly to dry ingredients, stirring and 
beating them wtII to keep free from lumps. 

7 When perfectly smooth, cut and fold in well-beaten 
whites. 

8 Add melted butter last. 

9 Fill muffin tins only one-third to two-thirds full. 
10 Bake at once. 

Pop-Overs 

1 cup flour % cup milk 

y^ teaspoon salt ^ teaspoon melted butter 

1 or 2 eggs 

Mix and sift flour and salt. Add yolks of tgg to milk 
and add gradually to the flour to obtain a smooth batter. Beat 
3 minutes. Then add well-beaten whites carefully. Add melted 
butter last. Turn into hissing hot gem pans or earthen custard 



195 



cups. Bake 25 to v>5 minutes in a hot oven. Serves 8 to 10. 

Or pop-overs may be mixed without separating the eggs, 
beat up slightly, add milk, and then add the liquid gradually 
to flour and salt. Beat batter 3 minutes with dover egg beater. 

Pop-overs are the simplest form of batter and are used as 
a muffin for breakfast, as an accompaniment to roast beef in 
the form of Yorkshire pudding, and as a simple dessert with 
lemon sauce. 

Graham Pop-Overs 

1 cup milk ^ tablespoon sugar 

1 egg Yi teaspoon salt 

y2 cup Graham flour ^ tablespoon melted fat 

^ cup white flour 
Beat the egg very light, add the milk and pour the liquid 
slowly onto thee dry ingredients w^hich have been mixed and 
sifted. Beat with an egg beater until bubbles appear on top. 
Add melted fat last. Bake in a moderately hot oven in hot 
well-greased iron gem pans 30 to 35 minutes. Makes 8 to 10. 

Noodles 

2 eggs Flour 

y2 teaspoon salt 

Beat the eggs until light, add salt and sufficient flour 
to make a very stiff dough; knead until smooth, roll thin as 
paper and when partially dry cut in thin strips. Let dry in the 
air. When dry place in a jar covered with cheese-cloth. 
Noodles will keep for several weeks, and may be used in the 
same way as macaroni. Cook in boiling water 30 to 40 minutes 
before adding to the soup. 

BAKING POWDER MIXTURES 

To Prepare Baking Powder Mixtures. 
Pastr}- flour is best for baking-powder mixtures, and should 
be sifted once before measurinn. 



196 



Only standard baking-powders should be used. Use 2 
teaspoons baking powder to 1 cup flour; ^ teaspoon soda and 
1 teaspoon cream of tartar can be substituted for 2 teaspoons 
baking powder. 

In combining baking-powder mixtures follow general rule 
for mixing batters, being careful to work quickly after baking 
powder has been moistened. 

Baking Powder Biscuits 

2 cups flour 2 tablespoons fat 

4 teaspoons baking powder ^ to 1 cup milk or water 

1 teaspoon salt 

!Mix the dry ingredients, chop fat into the flour with a 
knife, slowly add sufficient milk to make a dough not too soft 
to be handled. Use the knife while combining dough and 
when handling it on the board. Toss and roll dough gently 
on a slightly floured board, and cut into small biscuits. ^loisten 
tops with a little milk. Handle dough quickly, lightly, and as 
little as possible. Place on a buttered sheet. Bake in a hot 
oven till brown, from 12 to 15 minutes. Either white or whole 
wheat flour may be used for biscuit. Serves 6 to 8. Oven test — 
oven should be hot enough to color a piece of unglazed white 
paper to golden brown in 1 minute. 

Emergency Biscuits 

2 cups flour 2 tablespoons butter or 
4 teaspoons baking powder other fat 

1 teaspoon salt ^4 cup milk or water

place on a buttered plate and put in steamer over boiling water. 
Put cheese cloth under cover of steamer to absorb moisture. 
Cook 12 minutes. 

Dumplings may be cooked by laying them on top of meat 
in stew pan, cover kettle closely, keep stew boiling, and cook 
dumplings twelve minutes, without removing lid. Serves 6 to 8. 

Soda Biscuits 

1 pint flour 2 tablespoons shortening 
Yz teaspoon soda (level) (lard or other fat) 
3^2 teaspoon salt Yz cup sour milk 

Note: — If the sour milk, is not thick enough to clabber, it 
will not contain sufficient acid to neutralize the soda and the 
biscuits will be yellow and bitter. To avoid this, cream, of 
tartar can be combined with the soda (1 teaspoon). If there is 
no cream of tartar at hand it will be wise to use the recipe for 
baking powder biscuits. 

Mix and sift the flour, soda and salt. Chop in the fat with 
a knife, then add enough of the sour milk to make a soft dough. 
Toss onto a floured board and roll lightly. Cut out with a 
biscuit cutter and put in a greased pan. Bake 12 to 15 minutes 
in a hot oven. Serves 6 to 8.

Griddle Cakes 

Batter — Griddle cakes are prepared in the form of thin 
batters. 

Sweet, sour, or butter milk may be used in griddle cakes. 

Flour, stale bread, rice, corn meal or other cereals may 
form the foundation of griddle cake batters. 

The Griddle — Griddle cakes are made round or long in 
shape. 

Iron griddles hold an intense heat and give good results in 
baking. When black they heat best. 

Aluminum griddles — which require little or no greasing — 
heat very easily, are easily cleaned and light to handle. The 
aluminum griddle is apt to warp and one of the heavy cast 
aluminum must be selected to avoid this danger. 

Soapstone griddles — which must not be greased at all — 
give excellent results in baking but are very heavy. 

Electric griddles of steel or aluminum are most satisfactory 
because of the even heat which can be secured and maintained. 

Preparation of Griddle — Make sure the griddle is perfectly 
smooth. Rub an iron griddle well with salt to clean. 

If it is to be greased, rub it with a piece of salt pork on 
the end of a fork, with suet, or with beef drippings or lard on a 
soft cloth. Butter is expensive and burns too easily to be desir- 
able. 

Wipe off with tissue paper before using to remove any 
black. 

Scrape off any mixture that sticks. 



205 



Grease after each using. 

For cake turners the regulation cake turners, plain or 
perforated, are made, or a broad-bladed spatula may be used, 
or a broad-bladed knife. 

Baking — Pour batter carefully from spoon or pitcher so 
that it will take a round shape. 

• • Test griddle and l^atter first by baking one cake. When it 
bubbles on top evenly, turn and brown on under side. Turn 
only once while baking. 

Serving — Always have a hot plate ready for serving cakes. 
Serve immediately when baked. 

A perforated cover is good to put over the plate or a nap- 
kin may be folded over the cakes if they have to stand for a 
few minutes. 

Granulated sugar, powdered sugar, and syrups are all 
used as accompaniments in serving griddle cakes. 

Plain Griddle Cakes

place and let rise over night. In the morning beat up well, and 
bake on a hot griddle. Serves 16 to 20. 



207 



Waffles 

The Batter — Waffles are prepared with a thin batter richer 
than that used for griddle cakes and made Hghter by the use 
of more eggs. 

The Waffle Iron — W^affles are baked in a corrugated 
waffle iron which must be WTll-buttered with a brush or soft 
cloth each time before cooking a waffle. 

Baking — Both sides of a waffle iron must be heated before 
buttering and the waffle is baked largely by the heat of the iron. 
The first side of the waffle can be quickly turned, the second 
side will require longer cooking. Cook till both sides are well- 
browned. 

Serving — Have hot plates ready for serving. Serve as soon 
as baked. Serve with bacon, syrup, or powdered sugar. 

Waffles 

1 pint flour 1^ cups milk 

2 teaspoons baking powder 2 tablespoons melted 
y2 teaspoon salt butter 

3 eggs

beaten with milk; cut and fold in well-beaten whites of eggs 
carefully; add melted butter last. Bake on a hot, well-buttered 
waffle iron until well-browned and crisp. Serves 6. 

FRITTERS 

Fritters are batters or doughs which are fried in deep fat. 
Some vegetable or fruit is usually added to the batter or the 
fritter may be served with a sweet sauce or preserve. 

Fritters are served as an entree or side dish with meat or 
are used as a dessert. 

Fritter Batter 

1 cup flour ^ cup milk 

34 teaspoon salt 2 tablespoons butter 

1 teaspoon baking powder (melted) 

1 egg 



208 



Sift the dry ingredients together. Beat the egg, add the 
milk, add the liquid to the dry ingredients, then add the melted 
butter. Use the batter with apples, bananas, oranges, pine- 
apple, grated corn or cooked sweet corn, cold cooked cauliflower, 
celery that has been parboiled, oysters, or chopped clams. 
Serves 16 to 20. 

Apple Fritters 

Wash, quarter, pare, and core sour apples, cut quarters 
into halves, and stir into fritter batter. Drop by spoonfuls into 
deep fat, and fry until golden brown. Drain on absorbent 
paper, sprinkle with powdered sugar, and serve hot. See — 
Cooking in fats. 

Queen Fritters 

54 cup butter ^-2 cup flour 

V2 cup boiling water 2 eggs 

Put the butter in a sauce pan, add the water, and when 
boiling turn in all the flour at once, stirring until it forms a ball. 
Add the eggs, unbeaten, one at a time, and beat well. Fry a 
small spoonful at a time in deep fat until well-puffed and 
brown. Drain on absorbent paper; split and put jam or mar- 
marmalade inside of puff; sprinkle with powdered sugar. 
Serves 10 to 12. See — Cooking in fats. 

TIMBALES 

Timbales are entrees which are moulded and cooked in 
cases, or the term is applied to pastry preparations which are 
cooked in the shape of cases. 

The moulded timbale preparations may be savory or sweet. 
They may be prepared from a mixture which resembles a cus- 
tard, or a souffle, or a croc|uette mixture. 

To shape the timbale mixture a mould is well-buttered, 
then lined with sifted crumbs. 



209 

The timbale is steamed or baked in the mould or turned 
from the mould and egged, crumbed and fried as a croquette. 

The timbale is always turned from the mould and usually 
served hot with a white, brown or tomato sauce, peas, mush- 
rooms or other garnish, and an accompaniment of crisp bread. 

Swedish Timbale s — The timbales in the form of a pastry 
preparation most commonly used are the Swedish timbales. 
These are very thin batters which must be perfectly smooth and 
are cooked very quickly on hot irons until they are brown and 
crisp. 

The timbale irons are round, long or heart-shaped, often 
with a fluted surface. They are very heavy and hold a great 
deal of heat. They have a long handle to prevent burning of 
the hand while cooking. 

The irons should be kept perfectly smooth and clean and 
put away well-greased and wrapped in tissue paper. 

Swedish Timbales 

y^ cup flour 1 egg 

3^ teaspoon salt 1 tablespoon olive oil or 

1 teaspoon sugar melted butter 

y2 cup milk 
Sift the dry ingredients. Add the milk gradually, then the 
slightly beaten egg, and the oil; stir well, but do not beat; 
strain the mixture into a cup. Heat the timbale iron in fat 
which is hot enough to brown a cube of bread in one minute. 
The fat should be deep enough to cover the iron. When hot, 
dip the iron three-fourths into the batter, and then into the hot 
fat. Cook the timbale until a delicate brown; remove from the 
iron, and drain on brown paper. See — Cooking in fats. Serves 
30 to 40. 



BREAD 

Yeast bread or "light bread" is made by using yeast to 
produce the gas necessary for making the bread light. 

YEAST 

Yeast is a kind of plant without leaves, stems, or blossoms, 
microscopic in size but larger than bacteria. It consists of a 
single egg-shaped cell which splits in the center to form new 
plants or sends out little protuberances from the ends which 
break off as little buds to form new plants. The yeast plant 
multiplies very rapidly, many hundreds of cells being produced 
in a few minutes. 

Yeast plants are present in the air and found in the form 
of "bloom" on the surface of grapes, plums, and other fruits. 

Conditions for Growth 

The yeast plant needs moisture and heat for growth. 
The most favorable temperature is from 65 degrees to 
90 degrees F. Above 139 degrees the activities of yeast 
become arrested and at 212 degrees the plant is killed. A 
low temperature renders yeast inactive and at 32 degrees it may 
become ruptured. 

For food the yeast plant requires some nitrogenous and 
sugary material both of which it finds in the bread dough, for 
it acts together with the ferments in wheat in changing the 
starch to sugar. 

Action of Yeast 

As yeast grows it breaks sugar up into alcohol and carbon- 
dioxide, a process know^n as alcoholic fermentation. When 
yeast has grown in dough long enough to produce alcohol and 
carbon-dioxide in large quantities it is necessary to check this 
action by kneading the dough and finally by baking it as an- 
other form of fermentation is likely to set in and make the dough 
sour by the production of an acid. This is known as acetic fer- 
mentation and must not be allowed to begin in bread as it 

210 



211 



changes the flavor. Lactic acid fermentation may take place in 
bread if the milk used is not first scalded. 

Yeast produces a bread which is more wholesome and more 
porous than baking powder breads and which has a special 
flavor because some of the starch has been converted into sugar. 
In yeast breads there remain no harmful products because the 
alcohol and carbon-dioxide are both entirely given off during 
the baking. 

Preparation of Yeast 

Commercial yeast is grown in a mixture usually pre- 
pared of barley and w^ater. The yeast plants are collected, 
thoroughly washed, combined with fine starch, and pressed into 
small cakes which are wrapped in tin foil. This is known as 
"compressed yeast." There is not enough moisture retained for 
the yeast to grow; if it is kept cold it can be kept fresh for 
several days. Compressed yeast should have a pleasant, alco- 
holic odor, be a light tan in color and not be marked by dark 
streaks or mould. 

"Dry yeast" or "yeast foam" is combined with some starchy 
substance and is so free from moisture that it will keep in any 
temperature. It is cheaper than compressed yeast but longer 
time for rising is necessary if dry yeast is used. 

Licjuid yeasts are grown in a liquid solution prepared from 
flour, warm water, and hops. They are not usually handled 
commercially. 

Leaven is a portion of dough kept to be used as a starter in 
the next rising. It must be kept cold. That is the old-fashioned 
method of starting bread. 

Only yeast that is fresh and in good condition should be 
used in making bread. L^se Yz cake compressed yeast for 1 
quart liquid if the bread is set at night; 2 cakes if set in the 
morning. Soften 1 yeast cake in J4 cup lukewarm water. One 
cake of dry yeast is sufficient for one quart of liquid if it is to 
rise over night. 



212 



Liquid Yeast 

2 ounces hops 2 teaspoons salt 

2 quarts water 1 pound flour 

y2 pound brown sugar 3 pounds potatoes 

Boil the hops and water 1 hour. Add the sugar, salt, and 
flour. Let stand for three days in a warm place. If it foams over 
the top of the jar stir it well. On the third day add the potatoes, 
boiled and mashed. On the fourth day strain, bottle, and keep 
in a cool place. Use one cup of yeast to one quart of liquid 
when starting bread. 

Bread Flour 

The best flours for yeast breads are those prepared 
from wheat and rye because these two cereals contain a 
large amount of gluten. Gluten is one of the principal proteins 
of wheat and is valuable in bread making because it is very 
tough and elastic, binding the particles of flour together and 
thus retaining the gas bubbles that are formed during the gro\\1;h 
of the yeast. 

Spring wheat or hard wheat flours are best for bread 
making when yeast is used because they contain a high per cent 
of gluten. AMnter wheat or soft wheat flours are more desirable 
for all baking powder mixtures and are known as pastry flours. 

A good pastry flour is much whiter in color and smoother 
and finer in texture than is bread flour, and it retains the im- 
press of the fingers much more readily. 

Tests for Good White Flour 

A good bread flour should be creamy white in color and 
slightly granular to the touch. It should not show a tendency 
to lump or cake, nor readily hold the impress of the fingers if 
squeezed in the hand. 



213 



Flour should be kept in a cool, dry place. It should have 
no musty odor and should be looked over carefully before using 
to be sure that it is free from insects. 

Whole Wheat Flour 

Whole wheat flour may be used in all recipes in 
the same way that white flour is used. In whole wheat or 
entire wheat flour the outer covering has been removed and 
enough of the whole grain is retained to give the flour a 
dark color. The germ is usually retained in the whole wheat, 
hence the keeping qualities of whole wheat flour are not so good 
as those of white flour because of the larger per cent of fat 
present. 

The bread made from whole wheat flour is not so light as 
that from white flour because the siliceous covering of the grain 
which is retained contains a ferment resembling diastase, called 
cerealin. While the dough is rising this ferment acts upon a 
good portion of the starch, forming viscid compounds of dextrin 
and sugar preventing carbon dioxide from puffing up the bread 
as much as it otherwise would. 

Graham Flour 

Graham flour was originally a coarse, unbolted flour made 
by grinding the whole wheat which is first washed and cleaned. 
At the present time much of the graham flour is prepared by 
more or less perfect bolting. The food value of graham flour is 
the same as that of the so-called whole wheat flour. 

The graham flour is valued because it irritates the mucous 
membrane of the intestines, increases peristaltic action, thus 
giving the digestive tract needed exercise and acting as a laxa- 
tive, and supplies l)ulk to the food. It is usd in the same ways 
that white flour is used. 

Salt is added to the bread doufjh for flavor. 



214 



Sugar is used in bread, not so much to give flavor as to feed 
the yeast plant. 

Lard or butter is used for shortening but the presence of 
shortening retards, rather than favors, the growth of the yeast 
plants and so is used in small quantities except in fancy breads, 
then it it is well to add it after the sponge has become well 
started. 

Milk gives a whiter bread than water but both may be 
used either alone or in combination. The liquid used should 
always be scalded first to prevent the introduction of bacteria 
into the bread dough and to make sure that there is no danger of 
the milk souring during the time of rising. 

Mashed potatoes and potato water are often used, especially 
with dry yeast, as they favor the growth of the yeast plant and 
produce a bread which retains its moisture well. Whey is 
sometimes used as the liquid. 

MAKING BREAD 

The processes in bread making consist of mixing, knead- 
ing, rising, and baking. 

I Mixing — The method of mixing bread may be varied 
according to the kind of yeast used and the time allowed for 
rising. If dry yeast is to be used and if a long time is to be 
allowed for rising, a sponge is usually prepared first. When 
yeast has become active in the sponge enough flour is added to 
make a dough, which is then kneaded 20 minutes. W^hen com- 
pressed yeast is used and time of rising is to be short the dough 
is usually prepared at once and thoroughly kneaded for 20 min- 
utes. The dough should be put in a warm bowl, covered, and 
kept in a warm place free from drafts. 

II Kneading — Kneading is done on a wooden board which 
is first floured, or a metal board which is slightly greased, or the 
board may be covered wiht a "magic cover" which requires no 



215 



flour or grease. Bread should be kept warm during the 
kneading. 

The purpose of the first kneading is (1) to incorporate 
air; (2) to distribute yeast plants evenly; (3) to moisten each 
little starch granule; (4) to give a smooth, even surface; (5) to 
develop the gluten. 

The purpose of the second kneading is (1) to check the 
fermentation; and (2) to make the grain of the bread finer by 
working the gas through in fine, even bubbles. 

The time necessary for the first kneading is about 20 
minutes. The dough should be kneaded until it does not stick 
to the hands or board and is smooth, spongy, and elastic, rising 
quickly when indented. 

The time necessary for the second kneading is about 5 
minutes, or until there are no longer large, uneven bubbles. 

III Rising — The first rising will require from 2 to 8 hours 
according to the kind and amount of yeast used. The second 
rising w'ill require from ^ to 1 hour according to the tempera- 
ture of the dough. Test for rising — the dough should be doubled 
in bulk and spring back lightly when touched. 

If it is necessary to check rising quickly, the dough may 
be cut down wath a knife, and the rising may be retarded by 
subjecting the dough to a low temperature. 

IV Baking — Reasons for baking bread are (1) to check the 
fermentation and to kill the yeast; (2) to make the starch 
soluble; (3) to drive off the alcohol and carbon dioxide gas; 
(4) to make the bread light and porous; (5) to form a l)rown 
crust which will give a pleasant sweet flavor to the bread as 
the starch is dextrinized. 

Bread requires a hot oven. The temperature should be 
about 375 degrees, sufficient to brown a piece of unglazed white 
paper or a tablespoonful of flour in 3 minutes. The heat of 
the oven should increase slightly during the first 20 minutes, be 



216 



kept even during the next twenty minutes, and decrease during 
the last 20 minutes. The time for baking bread should be 
divided into fourths, the bread continuing to rise during first 
fourth, browning slightly during the second, continuing to brown 
during the third and drying out during the last quarter. Bis- 
cuits require a hotter oven than bread because they can be 
baked more quickly. 

When bread is thoroughly baked it does not cling to sides 
of pan, the crust is a golden brown, the sides will spring back 
when touched, and a hollow sound wdll be given forth if the 
crust is tapped. 

When bread is baked, the loaves should be taken from the 
pans, put on a wire rack, and left uncovered until cooled. Bread 
should be kept in a clean, ventilated tin box in a cool, dry place. 

Bread 

2 cups milk or water Yx cake compressed yeast 

(scalded) (1 cake if set in morning) 

2 teaspoons salt % cup water (lukewarm)

Put the hot water or milk, salt, sugar, and fat into a bowl; 
when lukewarm add the yeast softened in the lukewarm water, 
then the flour gradually, and when stiff enough to handle, 
turn dough out on floured board and knead until soft and 
elastic (20 minutes). Return dough into the bowl, moisten, 
cover and let it rise in a w^arm place until double its bulk; then 
knead slightly, divide into loaves, or shape into biscuits, cover 
and let rise in the pan in which they are to be baked until 
double in bulk, and bake 50 to 60 minutes. (2 loaves).

Pulled Bread 

Remove crusts from fresh bread, tear bread into small 
strips with two forks, and brown slowly in the oven so that 
bread is thoroughly dry and crisp. 

Uses for Stale Bread 

Stale bread, crumbed, is suitable for bread puddings, dress- 



222 



ings and fillings for scalloped dishes, omelets, griddle cakes, etc. 

Small dried pieces of stale bread may be rolled or ground, 
sifted and used for crumbing croquettes, cutlets, etc. 

Whole slices of stale bread may be used for toast, sippets, 
croutons, etc. 

Croutons 

Cut stale bread into ^^ inch cubes and brown in the oven. 

Sippets 

Cut bread into thin slices, then into strips 5 inches long 
and iy2 inches wide and toast them. 

Canapes 

Cut bread into pieces 2 inches thick, cut in rounds or in 
rectangles 4^ inches long by 3 inches wide. Remove part of the 
bread from the center, leaving i^ inch wall, butter, and brown 
in the oven. 

Soup Sticks 

Cut stale bread into ^ inch slices, remove crusts, then 
butter and cut in ^ inch strips ; brown in the oven. 

Zwieback 

Cut baker's bread or other light bread into 1 inch slices 
and brown slowly in a moderate oven. 

Toast 

Cut stale bread into slices J4 irich thick, put on toaster or 
fork, move gently over the heat until dry, then brown by placing 
nearer the heat, turning constantly. Bread may be dried in the 
oven before toasting. 

Milk Toast 

1 pint milk % teaspoon salt 

1 tablespoon butter 8 slices toast 

Scald the milk. Season with butter and salt. Pour over 
hot toast. 



223 



Cream Toast 

]/4 cup butter 2 cups milk or cream 

3 tablespoons flour 6 or 8 slices of toast 

1 teaspoon salt 

Heat the butter. When it bubbles, add the flour and salt, 
add hot milk gradually, stirring constantly, and allowing the 
mixture to thicken and bubble each time before adding another 
portion of milk. The sauce is sufficiently cooked when it boils 
up after the last addition of milk. Pour this sauce over pieces 
of dry or moist toast. Moist toast is prepared by quickly dip- 
ping dry toast into hot, salted water or hot milk. A cheaper 
sauce may be made by using 2 tablespoons butter. Serves 6 to 8. 

French Toast 

1 or 2 eggs 1 cup milk 

34 teaspoon salt 6 or 8 slices of stale bread 

3 tablespoons butter or oleomargarine 

Beat the eggs slightly, add salt and milk, and dip bread 
in mixture. Heat the fat in a frying pan, brown the bread on 
one side, turn and brown on the other side. Serve hot. Serves 
6 to 8. 

Crisp Crackers 

Split thick soda crackers, spread with butter, put on a 
baking sheet and place in the oven to brown. Serve with soup 
or salad. 

Nut Wafers 

1 2 salt wafers 34 cup chopped nuts 

1 egg white Salt 

Brush each wafer with white of egg which has been slightly 
beaten with water (1 tablespoon to 1 egg white), dust with finely 
chopped nuts, and sprinkle with salt. Dry in the oven till 
crisp. Serve with salad. 



224 



Toasted Crackers and Cheese 

12 salt wafers Salt 

y^ cup cheese Cayenne 

Season grated cheese with salt and Cayenne pepper. 
Sprinkle on salt wafers, put in a slow oven, and heat until 
cheese has melted. Serve hot with salads. 

Butter Balls to Serve with Bread 

Scrub butter paddles well with white soap and hot water, 
rinse in clean boiling water, and chill in ice water. 

^^'ith a piece of paper over the blade of the knife, cut each 
Dound of butter into 16 pieces of equal size. Shake water frorn 
the paddles, hold one paddle firmly in the left hand, and roll 
a piece of butter on that with the paddle in the right hand 
until round. 

SANDWICHES 

I The Bread — Sandwiches may be prepared from white, 
brown, graham or entire wheat bread. Crackers, pastry, and 
sweet wafers are sometimes used for fancy sandwiches. A bread 
of fine grain cuts to the best advantage. It should be at least 
24 hours old. 

II Slicing — Bread should be cut in thin slices for making 
sandwiches. It may be handled to better advantage if the slice 
is spread with butter before being cut from the loaf. 

III The Shape of Sandwiches — Care should be taken to 
cut the bread in regular pieces that match one another. If the 
loaf is large, these are usually divided into sections. A long 
narrow sandwich is most easily handled. Sandwiches may be 
trimmed into shape either before or after being spread. Except 
for a hearty sandwich the crust may be removed and the sand- 
wich may usually be made more attractive by cutting in fancy 
shapes; for example, in squares, triangular pieces, narrow 
strips, rounds, or with a fancy cutter. The edges must always 
be perfectly smooth. 



22S 



IV Spreading the Sandwich — The butter for spreading the 
sandwich should first be creamed as in making cakes. It will 
then spread more easily, and the bread will not be broken up. 
A spatula or soft knife is desirable for spreading the butter. 

V Keeping Sandwiches — Sandwiches should be protected 
from drying by covering with a damp cloth as soon as they 
have been made. If they are to be kept for some time before 
being used, they should be put in a cold place in a stone jar, or 
well- wrapped. If they are to be packed, it may be desirable 
to wrap the sandwiches in paraffin paper. 

VI Serving of Sandwiches — Sandwiches may be served 
piled neatly on a plate or each sandwich may be separately 
wrapped in paraffin paper. When served with afternoon tea, 
sandwiches are usually placed on a doily on a pretty plate. Hot 
sandwiches are sometimes prepared with a hot sauce and it is 
then necessary to serve them with a fork. 

VII Accompaniments to serve with Sandwiches — Coffee is 
the beverage most appropriately served with sandwiches.. Tea 
comes next. Cocoa and chocolate are good with a dainty sand- 
wich of sweet variety. Fruit drinks are frequently served with 
sandwiches. 

VIII Economy in Making Sandwiches — When making 
sandwiches one should plan to economize by utilizing the trim- 
mings of the bread for scalloped dishes, poultry stuffings, 
and puddings, and the crusts for crumbing croquettes, fried cut- 
lets, etc. Left-over portions of foods can frecjuently be utilized 
in sandwich fillings. 

IX Fillings for Sandwiches — Fillings of various kinds 
may be spread between the slices of bread. 

(1) 'Meat that has been cooked until very tender may be 
cut in very thin slices across the grain or chopped and seasoned 
with salt and mustard, Worcestershire sauce, horseradish, May- 
onnaise, etc. 



226 



(2) Fish may be flaked, chopped, or pounded, and 
flavored with onion juice, lemon, minced olives or pickles, 
Worcestershire sauce, tabasco, salad oil, vinegar, or mayonnaise. 

(3) Hot sandwiches may be prepared with a filling of 
sliced meat or fish and covered with a hot gravy or white 
sauce; or crisp slices of freshly broiled bacon may be used 
between slices of bread. 

(4) Eggs may be used, hard cooked and sliced or chopped 
and seasoned, or served with a salad dressing or lettuce. 

(5) Vegetables may be used for sandwich fillings by 
adding mayonnaise dressing or salad oil. 

(6) Cheese. Cream cheese may be softened with cream 
and delicately seasoned or combined with pimentoes and nuts, 
or hard cheese may be sliced or grated and seasoned with mus- 
tard, cayenne, and other seasonings for the preparation of 
sandwiches. 

(7) Nuts may be finely chopped and salted or combined 
with salad dressing or cheese, or made into sweet fillings with 
finely-chopped raisins, dates, etc. Nut butters are also a valu- 
able sandwich filling. 

(8) Sweet fillings are frequently used in sandwiches. For 
these, jelly, jam, dates, raisins, preserved ginger, candied 
orange peel, or maraschino cherries, chopped and moistened with 
fruit juice may be used. 

(9) Flavored butters. Plain butter may be creamed and 
various flavors added and beaten until smooth and thoroughly 
blended. The flavored butter may be packed in a jar and kept 
cold until it is needed. Flavors which may be added to the 
butter in this way are anchovy, caviar, sardines, cheese, curr>' 
powder, horseradish, olives, pickles, mint, water-cress, etc. The 
fancy butter makes an attractive filling, is less in evidence than 
other fillings, and makes the work of spreading the sandwiches 
simpler. 



SCALLOPED DISHES 

Scalloped dishes are made by combining foods with but- 
tered crumbs and baking. If the vegetable or fruit contains a 
large amount of juice, buttered crumbs are used alone. If the 
food be a dry vegetable, meat, or fish it is first combined with a 
thin white sauce, then covered with buttered crumbs. Scalloped 
dishes are valuable because they hold the heat well, special 
flavors are developed by the intense heat of the oven, and the 
buttered crumbs and white sauce make the nutritive value of 
the dish higher, especially where fat is added. 

Crumbs for scalloped dishes, dressings, etc., are prepared 
from the inside of stale bread, breaking it up with the fingers, 
grating or rubbing two pieces together. Measurements for 
bread crumbs refer to soft broken crumbs, not to dry rolled 
crumbs. If dry crumbs are used one half the amount is suf- 
ficient. 

Crumbs for scalloped dishes are buttered by adding them 
to melted butter and mixing thoroughly. Use 1 tablespoon 
butter to 1 cup crumbs. For savory dishes the crumbs should be 
seasoned, using j.^ teaspoon salt and a sprinkling of white or 
Cayenne pepper to each 1 cup of crumbs. 

Dishes prepared "au Gratin" are prepared as scalloped 
dishes with white sauce and the addition of grated cheese. The 
food value of the dish is thus decidedly increased. 

Scalloped dishes and dishes ''au Gratin" are prepared in 
large baking dishes or in individual ramekins. They are served 
hot in the dish. The dishes "au Gratin" may serve as a sub- 
stitute for a meat dish. 

Note: — See recipes for scalloped apples, cabbage, corn, 
egg plant, fish, meat, onions, oysters, potatoes, potatoes with 
eggs, potatoes with white sauce, rhubarb, rice, salmon, and 
tomatoes.

GARNISHINGS 

Feed is garnished ( 1 ) to please the eye; (2) to improve the 
flavor; (3) to increase the nutritive value; (4) to increase the 
bulk or sufficiency for service. 

A garnish must meet the following requirements: 

1 It must be edible. 

2 It must be appropriate to the dish with which it is 
served. 

3 It must be pleasing to the eye. 

4 It must not interfere with the service of the dish. 

5 It must be ready to put on so that the service of the meal 
is net delayed and the hot foods do not become cooled 
by standing. 

6 It must not be used to cover up the lack of skill in 
cooking. 

Materials use for garnishing include: — 

1 Fresh green vegetables, washed and crisped. Parsley, 
lettuce, cress, etc. 

2 Cooked vegetables cut in attractive shapes. Beets, 
carrots, etc. 

3 Potatoes. French-fried, riced, potato roses. 

4 Croquettes of vegetables and cereals. 

5 Sauces of good consistency and color. 

6 Small fish, oysters, mushrooms, strips of bacon, etc. 

7 Celery curls, slices of tomato, pickles, olives, etc. 

8 Toast, cut in fancy shapes. 

9 Puff pastry cooked in attractive forms. 

10 Jellies, lemons, cherries, etc. 

11 Nuts, washed and blanched, whole or chopped. 

12 Whipped cream and meringues. 

Flowers, nasturtiums, and violets, are occasionally used 
as a garnish. Thus nasturtiums may be used with a 
salad. Candied violets sometimes garnish a cake. How- 



229 



ever, flowers are more frequently used to decorate the 
table or the dish than the food stuff. Thus a rose is 
sometimes laid on the plate beside the sherbet cup or on 
the invalid tray. 



SALADS 

Salads may be divided into classes according to the ma- 
terials of which they are prepared. 

Class I — Salads prepared from the green salad plants, 
used when green and tender, and prepared without cooking. 
Examples — Lettuce, endive, watercress, celery, nasturtium, dan- 
delion, peppergrass, and mustard. 

Class' II. — Salads prepared from uncooked vegetables, 
fruits, and nuts. Examples — Tomato, cucumber, onion, cab- 
bage, radish, sweet pepper, olive, apple, banana, orange, grape 
fruit, pineapple, pear, cherry, grape, almond, English walnut, 
pecan, hazel nut. 

Class III — Salads prepared from cooked vegetables. Ex- 
amples — Potato, beet, carrot, asparagus, spinach, peas, beans, 
cauliflower, artichokes, rice. 

Class IV — Salads made from cooked meats, fish, eggs, and 
cheese, Examples — Chicken, sweetbreads, ham, veal, tongue, 
salmon, shrimp, lobster, sardine, oyster and crab. 

Class V — Salads made from vegetable, meat or fish stock, 
and prepared in the form of a jelly. Examples — Pressed 
chicken, aspic jelly, sardines in lemon jelly, tomato, cucumber, 
and mint. 

Salad dressings are made with oil as a foundation or 
with butter or cream as a foundation. 

Oil salad dressings include: 

(1) The French Dressing — prepared by combining oil, 
vinegar, and seasonings until thoroughly blended, used with all 
the fresh green salad plants, with vegetable and fruit salads. 



230 



231 



and to marinate the cooked vegetables, meats and fish used for 
salads. 

(2) Mayonnaise Dressing — prepared by combining oil, 
vinegar, and seasonings with egg-yolks and cream by cooking, 
used for vegetable, meat, fish, egg, and nut salads. 

(3) Cooked Mayonnaise Dressing — prepared by combin- 
ing oil, vinegar, and seasonings with egg-yolks and cream by 
cooking, used as a substitute for Mayonnaise. 

Cream Salad Dressings are prepared by combining butter 
or cream with vinegar and seasonings, and sometimes with eggs 
and milk, usually by cooking. (Mock Mayonnaise). 

Preparation of Salad Materials 

All green materials used for salads should be fresh, clean, 
crisp, and cold. 

All cooked materials should be carefully picked over, well- 
chilled, and cut in attractive forms. 

Left-over portions of cooked vegetables, meat, fish, and 
eggs, may be utilized in salads if judiciously combined. 

Flavors should be carefully combined. 

Garnishes should be attractive and appropriate. 

The salad should be combined just before being served, 
each part being well-chilled before combining. 

To Marinate — Cover the salad materials with French 
Dressing, combine well, and chill for a time before serving so 
that dressing is absorbed. 

Combinations for Salads — Great care must be taken to 
combine in a salad only flavors which will blend in an agreeable 
manner. 

Delicately flavored materials must not be used with those 
of strong flavors. 

There must be some distinctly pleasing flavor about the 
salad to render it appetizing. 



Some fresh green salad plant should be used in every salad 
if possible to make it refreshing. 

Salad Seasonings — Onion, leeks, chives, celery, celery seed, 
celery salt, green peppers, pimentoes, cayenne, paprica, pepper- 
corn. Tabasco, catsup, mustard seed, tarragon, olives, horse- 
radish, cloves, lemons, sugar, salt, etc., are seasonings used for 
salads. 

Salad Garnishes — The garnish for salad should be some- 
thing edible, attractive, and appropriate as an accompaniment 
to materials used in salad. 

Lettuce, endive, parsley, water-cress, celery leaves, nastur- 
tium leaves and flowers, pickles, olives, pimolas, nuts, lemons, 
green peppers, capers, beans, beets, radishes, hard cooked eggs, 
and whipped cream are materials used to garnish salads. 

Serving Salads — Salads are served as a course at luncheon, 
dinner or supper, or as an accompaniment to the fish, meat or 
game course. When served as a separate course, the salad should 
follow the meat. 

Salads also form an attractive dish for light refreshments. 

Only vegetable or fruit salads or salads with French 
Dressing should be used for dinner salads; those with May- 
onnaise or rich cream dressings should be used for luncheons, 
supper or refreshments. 

French Dressing is often prepared and added to the salad 
by the host or hostess at the table. 

Salad Accompaniments — Salads are accompanied by wa- 
fers, sandwiches of thin bread and butter (brown, white or 
graham), rolls, cheese straws and other cheese preparations. 

Value of Salads. 

1 Salads are healthful, adding to the diet fresh, green, 
uncooked vegetables and a mild acid which is stimulating and 
adds zest to the appetite. 



2 Salads are nutritious, adding oil or fat in an easily 
digested form to food. 

3 Salads are economical, because left-over portions can 
be combined and used advantageously. 

4 Salads are attractive, adding much to the appearance 
of the table, through coloring and possibilities of arrangement^ 
thus aiding the appetite of those M^ho eat and awakening the 
interest and developing the artistic skill of the cook.

CAKES 

There are two general classes of cakes — Sponge Cakes 
and Butter Cakes. 

Sponge Cakes are made light wholly by the presence of 
eggs lightly beaten and are usually made without baking pow- 
der, butter, or liquid. Sponge cakes include: 

Sponge Cake proper, made with the whole egg. 

Sunshine Cakes, in which the whites and only a few of 
the yolks are used. 

White Sponge Cakes or Angel Food, in which only the 
whites of eggs are used. 

Mock Sponge Cakes contain some milk, water, or baking 
powder. 

Butter Cakes are made with butter and resemble other bat- 
ters, except that the butter, sugar, and eggs are usually larger 
in amount, and the texture of the baked batter is much finer 
and more tender than in muffins and quick breads. 

Rules for Cakes 

No. I Pans — For butter cakes, the pans may be thoroughly 
greased with the same kind of fat that is to be used in the 
mixture, or sprinkled with flour or lined with greased paper. 

For sponge cakes the pans should be clean, smooth, and 
dry. 

No. II Materials — Pastry flour should be used in all cakes. 
If bread flour must be used, make the measure scant. 

Fine granulated sugar, good butter or other sweet fat, and 
fresh eggs should be used. 

No. Ill Utensils — Use an earthen bowl, never a tin basin 
for mixing cakes. Stir with a wooden spoon or spatula, and 
use a dover egg beater or wire whip for beating. 

No. IV Method of Combining — The method of mixing 

243 



244 



cake will vary with the materials and the proportions in which 
they are used. 

In general sponge cakes are combined by cutting and fold- 
ing all the other ingredients into well-beaten egg whites; butter 
cakes are combined by adding all other ingredients to well- 
creamed fat. 

No. V Oveti — The oven should be hot enough to brown a 
small piece of white unglazed paper to golden brown or Manila 
color in — 

ZjA minutes for layer cake 

3 minutes for chocolate cake and ginger bread. 
3^ minutes for loaf cake. 

4 minutes for sponge cake. 

5 minutes for Angel Food Cake and Meringues. 

No. VI Baking — The time for baking wdll vary with the 
size, shape, and kind of cake. 

Sponge cake should cook from 40 minutes to 1 hour. 

A butter cake should cook — 

20-30 minutes in a shallow layer pan. 

20-25 minutes in individual muffin pans. 

40-60 minutes in a loaf pan. 

Tests for baking — 

1 The cake shrinks from the sides of the pan. 

2 The crust springs back when touched with the finger. 

3 The loud ticking sound ceases. 

4 A needle will come out clean if the cake is pierced. 

5 The cake is nicely browned. 

No. YII Care After Baking — When a butter cake is re- 
moved from the oven, let it stand in the pan about 3 minutes, 
then loosen with a spatula, and turn it gently on to a wire cake 
cooler. Remove paper and leave until cool. Do not handle the 
cake while hot. 

A sponge cake should be left in the pan until cold. Invert 



245 



the pan so that the air can pass around it. When cooled, 
loosen well witli a spatula. 

Keep in a clean, ventilated tin box in a cool, dry place.

SMALL CAKES AND COOKIES 

Any cake batter may be baked in muffin tins to make 
small individual cakes to be served as tea cakes. These will 
require a hotter oven than loaf and layer cakes, and can be 
baked in a shorter time. 

Batters for butter cakes may also be used for drop cakes 
or cookies by adding more flour to make the batter the consis- 
tency of a very soft dough, almost as soft as for baking powder 
biscuits. Cookies must be handled lightly and carefully and 
cooked quickly so that they will not dry out. They must be 
carefully watched to avoid burning any part. The time for 
baking will vary from 10 to 15 minutes according to the thick- 
ness of the cooky. 

If a large amount of butter is used, the cooky will be crisp 
and tender. A smaller amount of butter and a greater amount 
of liquid give a softer cooky. Cookies become softer with keep- 
ing, especially if kept in a stone jar or if a piece of bread is 
kept with them. If cookies are hard and dry, too much flour 
has been used.

PASTRY 

There are three classes of Pastry: plain, flaky, and puff 
paste. 

Plain and flaky paste are used for pies and tarts; puff 
paste is used for meat pies and patties. 

Plain paste is prepared by chopping the fat into the flour; 
flaky and puff paste are prepared by adding most of the fat in 
layers between the layers of dough, and combining them by 
rolling and folding. 

Ingredients Used in Pastry 

Pastry Flour, which takes up but a small quantity of water 
and contains less gluten than bread flour, should be used for 
pastry, as it gives a more tender crust. 

Fat or Shortening is used to make pastry tender. Butter 
gives the better flavor, lard makes a more tender crust and one 
of lighter color. Beef drippings, suet, and many prepared com- 
mercial fats may be used. In plain pastry from ^ to ^ as 
much fat as flour by measure, is used. Fat should be cold 
when used. 

Baking Powder. Pastry is made light by the expansion of 
cold air. Baking powder may be added to increase this light- 
ness and to make a cheaper paste as the per cent of fat can 
then be reduced. From ^ to 1 teaspoon baking powder may 
be used to each cup of flour. 

Salt is added to give flavor to the paste. 

Sugar is sometimes used if a sw^et paste is desired. 

Water used should be very cold and just enough to hold 
ingredients together, as the presence of very much water makes 
the pastry tough. 



262 



263 



Utensils Used When Making Pastry 

A smooth, perfectly clean bread board is essential. A 
marble or metal board is sometimes used because it can be kept 
very cold. 

A smooth rolling pin that can be kept clean is desirable. 
Glass or china rolling pins are considered good l^ecause thev can 
be kept very cold. 

Pie tins should be kept in good condition. Granite or 
aluminum are best, especially for fruit pies. Perforated tins are 
considered good for baking under crust thoroughly. 

Requisites in Making Pastry 

Keep paste cold, as it is considered essential that fat does 
not begin to melt until baking begins, the cold air will cause 
the paste to expand more in baking, and cold paste is easier to 
handle. 

Handle quickly and lightly so that the gluten is not de- 
veloped in the flour. 

Handle deftly so that there will be but little waste, and the 
board, the pin, and the person may be kept neat. 

General Rules for Making Pastry 

Sift all dry ingredients together. Chop in cold fat with a 
knife. Do not toucli with hands. Do not chop fat very fine if a 
flaky crust is desired. 

Add cold water very carefully, a few drops at a time, and 
only enough to hold the dough together. 

Toss on a floured board with a knife so that the entire 
surface is slightly floured. Handle only the quantity that is to 
be used for one crust at a time. 

Roll lightly and quickly, in one direction only, and on 
one side only. 

Roll thin and as nearly the .^hape of the pan as possible. 



264 



Fold and lift the paste carefully to the pie plate, and trim one- 
fourth inch larger than plate. 

Work scraps together lightly, keep them covered with a 
moist cloth, and very cold; they may be used another day. All 
pastry rolls more easily after chilling. 

Left-over pastry may be used for cheese straws and tarts. 

Plain paste for a one-crust pie may be baked on the out- 
side of the pie tin, and carefully pierced with a fork before 
baking so that bubbles will not spoil the shape. 

Meat, oyster pies, and pies made with fresh fruit are best 
made without an under crust. They should be baked in an 
earthen or granite dish. 

The upper crust should always be perforated to allow the 
escape of steam. 

If the upper crust is brushed with beaten egg before bak- 
ing it will brown better, and have a shiny appearance. 

If the pie is a juicy fruit pie it is well to brush the under 
crust with beaten white of egg to prevent the juice making the 
crust soft. 

The lower crust should always be moistened around the 
edge with cold water, the upper crust placed over it, and the 
two pressed tifjhtly together. 

A half-inch strip of paste may be placed around the edge 
of the under crust in order to hold the two more firmly together. 
This must be moistened with cold water before the upper crust 
is added. A strip of muslin wet in cold water may be placed

FROZEN DISHES 

Purposes of Freezing 

The purpose of freezing is the extraction of heat from food 
in order to prepare an appetizing and cooling dish that will be 
refreshing to the body. 

The degree of heat at which food is served has much to 
do with making the food palatable, and when the temperature 
of the food is reduced to the freezing point there is a decided 
change in flavor. The proportion of sugar and flavoring used 
in a dish which is to be prepared by freezing must be about 
double that used in other desserts, as the organs of taste are 
less sensitive when chilled. 

Principles of Freezing 

The principle of freezing is extraction of heat through the 
melting of ice and the subsequent melting of salt — a double 
action. 

Salt has a strong affinity for water — thus salt is used with 
the ice, causing it to melt; but heat is necessary to change the 
ice from a solid to a liquid, and heat is drawn from the nearest 
substance, hence the mixture to be frozen is packed in a vessel 
made of some substance which is a good conductor (a metal 
pail) and the ice is surrounded by a non-conducting material 
(a wooden pail) so that the heat will not be drawn from the 
surrounding air. 

Value of Frozen Dishes 

Frozen dishes are refreshing to the body but retard diges- 
tion by lowering the temperature of the stomach. They are less 
harmful if used between meals because then they do not inter- 
fere with the digestion of other foods. They are often valuable 
in sickness in helping to cool the temperature of the body. 



292 



!93 



Ice creams are all rich and nourishing, but fruit ices are 
merely refreshing to the body. 

Frozen dishes are used as appetizers, as a relish with meat 
or game, or as a dessert. 

Utensils necessary for preparing frozen dishes are: — an 
ice pick, burlap bag and mallet or ice chopper, patent freezer, 
cup or dipper to handle the ice, burlap and newspaper to cover 
the freezer. 

Methods of Preparing Frozen Dishes 

Ices are made from sweetened fruit juice. They are made 
more smooth by cooking the water and sugar together to a thin 
syrup. If too much sugar is used the mixture is hard to freeze; 
if too little, it is coarse and rough. (1^ cups sugar to a quart 
of water, boil 5 minutes and strain.) Frozen fruit is prepared 
from fruits pressed through a colander, or cut» in small pieces 
with a silver knife, or w^hole fruits cooked in syrup before 
adding as they freeze too hard if uncooked. 

Ice creams are made with sweetened and flavored creams. 
Scalded cream gives a smoother, more velvety ice cream but 
swells less than raw cream in freezing. Scald cream, dissolve 
sugar in it, cool, add flavoring, and freeze. Either fruit juice 
or crushed fruit may be used for ice cream; it is preferable to 
use only the juice of very seedy fruits. When preparing ice 
cream with fruit the sugar and crushed fruit should stand one 
hour in a cool place, or until the sugar is dissolved, then it is 
added to the cream and frozen. 

General Rules for Freezing 

The can, cover, and dasher of the freezer should l)e scalded, 
and then chilled before the mixture which is to be frozen is 
placed in it. Adjust the can carefully in the tub before packing. 
Pour in the mixture, put in the dasher, cover, adjust the crank, 
and pack with finely chopped ice and rock salt; this must be 



294 



higher around the can than the mixture is inside. A freezer 
should never be filled more than three-fourths full, to allow for 
expansion in freezing. 

Use four times as much ice as salt for freezing; use five 
times as much ice as salt in packing. The larger the quantity 
of salt used the more quickly the freezing takes place and the 
coarser the grain. Coarse rock salt gives the best results in 
freezing. A heavy bag of burlap, canvas, or carpet, and a 
wooden mallet are excellent for pounding the ice. 

The rate of turning the freezer also affects the grain of 
the frozen dish. If the freezer is turned slowly and steadily 
the mixture is fine grained and velvety. This is desirable for 
ice cream. If the freezer is turned quickly and the mixture 
freezes rapidly it becomes granular. This is desirable for sher- 
bet. A mixture which is frozen quickly and stirred only inter- 
mittently is full of crystals. Use for water ice and frozen fruit. 

After cream is frozen it is much improved if repacked for 
2 or 3 hours to '"ripen." Ripening develops a rich flavor and 
delicious "grain." 

When the mixture is frozen, remove ice and salt from 
around the top of the can; wipe cover and top with a cloth 
wrung out of hot water; uncover and remove dasher, scrape it; 
then beat frozen mixture with wooden spoon or paddle five 
minutes; place paraffin paper or heavy paper over can; cover 
and put a cork in the hole. Drain off all the water which has 
collected during the freezing and which should not be removed 
until freezing is completed; repack the freezer, putting ice and 
salt over the top, and cover with carpet or newspaper, and 
allow it to stand in a cold place for several hours. 

A tightly covered tin can and a wooden pail may be sub- 
stituted for an ice cream freezer, using a wooden spoon or 
paddle to scrape the mixture from the sides and bottom of the 
can as it freezes. 



295 



To mould an ice after freezing, pack solidly in a mould, 
cover with paraffin paper and bury in ice and salt, using six 
parts ice to one of salt. 

Danger from Eating Frozen Mixtures 

Cans for freezers should be made of a good equality of tin. 
If an acid mixture is allowed to stand in tin for a long time 
when not chilled it may act on the tin, forming poisonous 
compounds. 

Danger from ptomaine poisoning comes from allowing old 
cream to stand for a long time. Ptomaine poisoning is a form 
of decomposition which develops slowly in organic matter. 
There is seldom much danger of it occurring except in very hot 
weather and where foods are carelessly handled. 

Digestive disturbances are apt to occur if frozen dishes 
are eaten hurriedly or in large quantities.
