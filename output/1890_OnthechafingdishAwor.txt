PREFACE. 



These few receipts for the Chafing* 
Dish I have found successful in making 
the informal Sunday night tea a meal 
much to be desired. All of them are 
dishes simply and easily prepared by the 
housekeeper herself — or himself. 

In twenty minutes, or at the longest, 
half an hour, at a small table — set either 
in the pantry or in a corner of the dining- 
room — upon which is placed the chafing- 
disn or the blazer, one can prepare any 
of the following receipts, thereby pro- 



iv PREFACE.

ducing a hot dish for tea» much more 
delicate and appetizing than when cooked 
over the range. 

The cook who has done her duty dur- 
ing the week feels that she has earned 
her Sunday evening for church-going, 
and when called upon for hot dishes is 
apt to do them hurriedly — perhaps com- 
plainingly. Certainly dishes prepared in 
this manner lack the exquisite seasoning 
and daintiness which is given them by 
one thoroughly interested in the com- 
pounding and stirring which is so neces- 
sary. 

A chafing-dish consists of one dish 
within another, the under one contain- 



^RlSFAClL 



ing boiling water— kept boiling, of course, 
by an alcohol lamp. 

Eggs and delicate concoctions arc 
much better cooked over boiling water. 

Again there are certain stews and 
devils which are better done on a blazer, 
w^'^b is a dish placed directly over the 

flame.

Eggs and Tomato. 

Five eggs. 

Butter the size of an egg. 

Half of a can of tomatoes. 

One small onion cut in fine bits. 

Small tea-spoonful of corn starch. 

Salty white pepper and celery salt to 
taste. 

Note. — It is impossible for me to 
give the exact amounts of seasoning with 
condiments, because tastes so greatly 
differ. For my own taste in this receipt, 



ID ON THE CHAFING-DISH. 

I use a small coffee- spoonful of salt» 
the same of celery salt, and quarter the 
amount of pepper, which should always 
be ground fresh from a small mill — 
whether white or black pepper be used. 
I should also advise if possible to use the 
Royal celery salt, which has more celery 
and less salt than any of the others. 

Stew the tomatoes, onion and butter 
together in the chafing-dish for six min- 
utes, then stir in the corn starch. Add 
the eggs, which have been broken into a 
bowl and stirred lightly together with a 
fork. Then add seasoning. A little 
chopped parsley is an improvement 
Stir constantly until rather thick and

Serve with hot buttered toast and 
anchovies.

roni

add the butter ; then the eggs, which 
have been well mixed together ; then the 
macaroni, mushrooms, salt and last the

p^CrsIey. Stir over the boiliiig water six 
or eight minutes. 

Serve with milk biscuits which have 
been heated, buttered and had a dash of 
cayenne pepper over them. 

Note. — For cooking on the chafing- 
dish I advise always using print butter. 
It may seem a little extravagant. But 
surely when one in evening attire pre- 
pares a dish which proves to be ?ibove 
reproach, one may say with the March 
hare, "It is the best butter," without 
losing the reputation of being an eco- 
nomical as well as a good housekeeper.

Eggs with Anchovies. 

Five eggs. 

Large table-spoonful of butter. 

Four table-spoonfuls of creaiiL 

Salt and very little white pepper. 

Have by you upon a dish some thin 
slices of buttered toast upon which have 
been spread anchovies from which the 
heads and back bones have been taken. 
Stir butter, cream and eggs in the chafing 
dish with salt and pepper. When thick- 
ened pour over the anchovy toast and 
serve. 

Note. — The best anchovies to use are 



ON THE CHAFING-DISa 15 

those which are packed with bay leaves 
and spices in small wooden kegs. 

This dish of eggs with anchovy toast 
Is very appetizing (or breakfast alsa

Hard-Boiled Eggs with Anchovy 

Toast. 

Have prepared thin slices of buttered 
toast with anchovies spread upon them, 
or anchovy paste will answer. 

Put into the chafing-dish a table 
spoonful of butter with which is mixed 
small coffee-spoonful of dry mustard. 
Two table-spoonfuls of tomato sauce, orte 
table-spoonful of Worcester sauce, one 
tea-spoonful of mushroom sauce. 

As soon as thoroughly mixed lay in 
this sauce, which should be of smooth 
texture and rich in color, slices of four

hard-boiled eggs, upon which have been 
scattered a little salt and cayenne pepper. 
When heated, take out the slices of egg, 
lay on the anchovy toast and pour over 
the whole the sauce. There will be but 
little sauce, but what there is will be very 
piquant 

The eggs should be boiled early in the 
day for twenty minutes.

been mixed ; the whites of the eg^s, cut up 
very fine ; a little salt Stir constantly until 
boiling hot In the meantime let some 
one spread thick over slijces of buttered 
toast the paste, over which scatter the 
cheese, over this pour the hot white

are well filled out with the edges curling, 
and serve with thin slices of graham toast 
buttered.

superfluous liquor, and drain again. Set 
aside in a shallow dish.

spoonful of curry powder, four table-spoon 
f uls of liquor from oysters, one tea-spoonful

Oysters may be done in the same way, 
but are not so tempting as clanuL

Lobster. 

One cold boiled lobster picked apart, 
not in too fine pieces, the fat kept sep- 
arate from the meat 

Quarter of a pound of butter. 

Four table-spoonfuls of cracker crumbs. 
Use the cream crackers rolled fine. 

Yolks of three hard-boiled eggs. 

Note. — The eggs should be boiled 
early in the day and allowed to become 
perfectly cold, otherwise they will not 
cream well with the butter. 

Yolk of one raw egg. 

Cofifee-spoonful of dry mustard. 



ON THB CHAFING-DISH. ^7 

Salty black and cayenne pepper mixed 
with the dry lobster to highly season it 

Tea-cupful of rich milk. 

Mix the butter, fat of the lobster, 
yolks of the hard-boiled eggs and mustard 
to a smooth paste. Heat in the chafing- 
dish and add gradually the milk and 
beaten yolk of the raw Ggg, then add 
cracker crumbs and lobster. Toss the 
mixture about with fork and spoon until 
thoroughly heated through and serve.

Crab on Chaflng-Dish. 

Meat of twelve boiled crabs picked up 
as for deviled crabs. 

Half tea-cupful of butter. 

Half tea-cupful of cream. 

Half tea-cupful of dried bread crumbs. 

Small tea-spoonful of dry mustard. 

Yolks of two eggs. 

Salt, black and cayenne pepper. 

Mix the mustard with the butter, and 
heat it with cream in the chafing-dish. 
Add very gradually the beaten yolks of 
the eggs, the bread crumbs and seasoning; 



ON THE CHAFING-DISH. 29 

lastly the crab meat. Cook eight minutes. 
If the crabs are very large, eight will be 
sufficient for this amount of sauce. 



30 ON THE CHAFING-DISIL 



Terrapin. 

All terrapin lovers know that the dia- 
mond backs should be selected with great- 
est care, and that they should be boiled 
with judgment in not too much water, 
slightly salted. No spices should be used 
either in the boiling or in the preparing of 
the meat afterwards, as they only destroy 
the exquisite flavor of the terrapin itself. 
After removing the meat from the shell 
take with great care the gall from the 
jaiiddle of the liven The bones should 
be also taken out The meat should be 
firm but tender, never stringy, which comes 



ON THE CHAFING-DISH. 3I 

from boiling too hard or from the terra- 
pin being inferior. 

The juice which runs from the terra- 
pin should form a clear firm jelly about 
the meat when the whole is cold. 

After all this, the preparing in the 
chafing-dish is but a simple process. 

To two medium sized terrapins take 
half-a-pound of print butter, melt in the 
chafing-dish, add the cold terrapin, which 
having been boiled in the morning as 
I have advised, now turn from the 
bowl in which it has been placed, add 
salt to taste and put two dashes of cay- 
enne pepper ; when thoroughly heated 



a

through add claret-glass of sherry. Serve 
on hot rather deep plates. 

Note. — I know that many think the 
addition of cream a great improvement, 
and some make the foundation of the 
sauce with yolks of eggs, but I cannot 
advise either of these additions, never hav- 
ing had the courage to even try to improve 
an already perfect dish.

Chicken with Mushrooms. 

The white meat of a large cold roast 
or broiled chicken cut in small pieces. 

Can of mushrooms. 

Tea-cupful of milk. 

Yolks of three eggs, 

Half a tea-cupful of butter. 

Tea-cup of veal or chicken broth. 

Salt and white pepper. 

Two tea-spoonfuls of com starch. 

Put milk and broth into the chafing-dish. 

When thoroughly heated add the but- 
ter, with which the com starch has been 
creamed.

beaten yolks of the eggs. When a smooth 
sauce, add the chicken, mushrooms and sea- 
soning. A table-spoonful of fine cut celery 
is an improvement. Serve with hot toast. 

Note. — The tea-cupful of broth may 
be omitted, and two table-spoonfuls of 
gi^vy from the roast used instead ; or if 
either of them is not procurable a half tea* 
cupful of cream will answer. 

In all of the following receipts the 
fowl or meat used is from a cold roast, 
often the remains from a Saturday or 
Sunday dinner. 

Always see that the cook sets aside a 
cup of stock or gravy which, when cold, 
becomes a jelly, and adds greatly to the 
richness ^nd flavor of certain dishes.

Chicken Hollandaise. 

Two cofTee-cupfuls of the light and 
dark meat of the chicken chopped fine. 

Half a tea-cupful of butter. 

Two tea-cupfuls of boiling water. 

One tea-spoonful of corn starch. 

Yolks of two eggs. 

Juice of half a lemon. 

Half a cup of celery, chopped fine. 

Tea-spoonful of chopped parsley. 

Tea-spoon of chopped onion.

to thicken. Then add lemon juice, the 
beaten yolks, celery, onion, and pepper 
and salt to taste. Stir well. In this 
sauce heat the chicken and serve imme- 
diately with buttered graham toast 

Note. — ^With a little care the yolks 
of uncooked eggs may be used with no 
danger of curdling. Hold in your left 
hand the small bowl, in which you have 
beaten the yolks. With your right hand 
dip from the chafing-dish and stir into 
the yolks a half-dozen spoonfuls of the 
mixture you have already prepared. 
Then pour slowly back into the chafing- 
dish from the bowl in your left hand, stir*

One tea-spoonful of dry mustard. 

Two dashes of pepper sauce. 

Mix butter and sauces with a little 
salt in the blazer. Then put in the 
bones, into the meat of which, if they are 
turkey or chicken, yoii have cut little 
gashes. Turn them continually in the 
sauce until it has nearly been absorbed 
into the bones and it actually begins to 
scorch at the bottom. 

Serve, if possible, with boiled rice, 
which has been steamed so that each ker« 
nel stands alone. 

Note. — I watched this dish prepared 
by an Englishman of her Majesty's 
service — ^who was as much given as I to

experimenting upon the chafing-dish. 
The deviled bones were pronounced a 
great success by the American friend, 
and I take pleasure now in introducing it 
among my receipts, as I have heretofore 
introduced it to many friends from my 
own blazer. 

A Digression. — This same gallant 
officer sent for us one rainy evening to 
come and enjoy a rare treat " An Ameri- 
can dainty prepared by myself over the 
blazer" as he expressed it Delighted 
with the idea of a reminder of home, 
we donned waterproofs and galoshes and 
hurried across the dark slippery street and 
wet lawn to the quaint Italian villa, where 



ON THE CHAFING-DISae 43 

in the brightly lighted and cozy salon we 
found the silver blazer doing duty, close- 
ly covered, but emitting a savory odor, 
familiar, yet mystifying, causing a wave of 
homesickness as from some association, 
which eluded our grasp when we were 
told to guess at the contents of the 
blazer. 

Then the cover was triumphantly 
lifted, disclosing to view — ^baked beans. 
Our friend had discovered them canned 
at a shop ambitious to appear Americaa 
This was his first introduction to them. 
" This is a course you always serve at 
your dinner, is it not T he asked inno- 
cently. 



44 ON THE CHAFING-DISH. 

I had thought to have added to my 
little book an Englishman's receipt for 
preparing baked beans on the chafing-dish 
as well. But alas I there is no sauce 
however piquant, no condiment however 
spicy, that will impart the same flavor to 
beans prepared on a blazer in our luxu- 
rious American homes, as was found to 
lurk in those canned American beans — 
eaten that stormy evening as we sat 
around the hospitable board of our friends 
in the picturesque old villa. The spice 
which lent the charm must have been the 
response to the homesickness caused by 
the whiff from the blazer, redolent of New 
England Sunday breakfast

A loaf of Boston brown bread which

well with this dish, as so I have seen it 
proved, to the manly taste.

Baked Shad with Roe Sauce. 

I give the following receipt although 
it does not apply entirely to Sunday night 
tea, as only the sauce is made on the 
chafing-dish. The baking of the shad 
necessitates the cook's remaining at home 
— also being in her most amiable mood, 
as basting is an essential. 

A fine large shad — z Potomac shad 
if possible — stufled and baked. The 
stuffing made of two cupf uls of dried bread 
crumbs, quarter of a pound of butter, an 
onion chopped fine, table-spoonful of pars- 
ley, the same amount of green thymCi

four table-spoonfuls of canned tomato, one 
table-spoonful Worcester sauce, salt and 
black pepper. 

After putting the shad into the baking 
pan, place over the top slices of raw 
tomato sprinkled with salt and pepper. 

Baste, while baking, with butter, a little 
hot water, and just before done pour over 
the whole a mixture of glass of sherry, 
two table-spoonfuls of Worcester sauce, 
the same of lemon juice and dash of 
Tabasco sauce. 

The sauce prepare upon the chafing 
dish so as to have ready when the shad is 

ient up.

in salted water in which are six cloves, a 
bay leaf, and bunch of thyme. 

Remove the skin from the roe, pick it 
up with a silver fork and place in the chaf- 
ing-dish with half a tea-cupful of butter, a 
little salt, if needed, and cayenne pepper. 
When the butter has melted, stir in a 
table-spoonful of tomato sauce, one oi 
lemon juice, and glass of sherry or Madeira. 

Cook five minutes, and serve with the 
baked shad. " Have with this dish sliced 
cucumber with addition of chives or new 
onions, if liked.

Then add the /resA cheese, which has

When the cheese is well ihbked, and

The quantity of ale to be add^d will 
depend in a measure upon the fluidity of 
the melted cheese. The more fluid the 
cheese, the less ale will be needed

Just before serving, add the port or 
sauce, which should be well stirred into 
the mass. (This ingredient may be 
omitted if desired.) Make timely prep- 
aration of toasted bread. It is preferable 
to remove the crust— -cutting it off with 
a sharp knife. The toast itself should 
first be slightly moistened with water, and 
then be buttered ; after which the slices 
should be placed upon their appropriate 
plates in an oven or heater, so that they 
(plates and toast) may be hot when the 
rarebit is ready to serve. 

When the rarebit is ready, have the 
hot plates and toast also in readiness.

Welsh Rarebit No. 2. 

Stir the yolks of two eggs, well beateiit 
into a half cupful of milk. 

When smoothly mixed, put into the 
hot chafing-dish. 

Add to this a heaping table-spoonful 
of butter, a sherry glass of sherry, salt 
and cayenne pepper. 

Stir into this mixture one pound of 
flaked cheese ; cook for five minutes, stir 
ring lightly and rapidly, and serve as 
advised in the above receipt 



^1 ON THE CttAttNG-DlStt 

Note. — The secret of a good Welsh 
rarebit is in using only the simple Amer- 
ican cheese, which' should be very fresh ; 
in stirring; and in serving so soon as it 
has reached the consistency of a smooth, 
thick custard 



EPILOGUE. 



^ Not too divine to toss you up a salad/* 

Austin Dohsofi 

Some like a salad after the chafing-dish, 
with the addition of cold game, ham or 
tongue, a bit of cheese, or possibly a 
mayonnaise of chicken, lobster, or sliced 
tomatoes. I therefore venture to give a 
little advice upon salads, hoping it may 
prove acceptable, especially where the 
head of the house does not feel enthusi- 
astic over an early dinner. 

Lettuce, dressed at the table, goes well 
with game, using the French dressing,

made with salt, white or black pepper 
freshly ground, a dash of cayenne, a littld 
vinegar and plenty of sweet oil. Celery 
salt and Chili Colorado are improvements 
if one has them. A crisp, white head of 
cabbage, shredded with two or three green 
bell peppers, makes a good salad with 
ham or tongue, dressed as one does the 
lettuce. 

Celery cut into bits and mixed with 
water-cresses, dressed in the same manner, 
with chicken, turkey or birds. 

A potato salad in the Spring is a dish 
of itself. Cold boiled potatoes — small 
new potatoes — cut in thin slices ; three 
new onions, sliced with three new beeta 



EI>ILOGUE. 75 



Dress with French dressing, using a little 
more vinegar than for other salads. This 
should be mixed a-half hour before tea, as 
standing improves it. 

A good Spring salad is also made with 
one bunch of celery cut fine ; one bunch 
of French water-cress ; a handful of corn- 
salad, bunch of radishes, cut into bits, 
and one small onion cut very fine. Use 
Prench dressing. 

No one could give better advice upon 
the making of mayonnaise than Mr. Murry 
in his little book ; in fact one is quite safe 
in trying each of his *' Fifty Salads." 

I cannot resist giving one very fine 
fish salad invented at my own table. 



76 EPILOGUE. 



Two cupfuls of cold boiled weak fish, 
flaked in quite good sized pieces ; half a 
pound of cold boiled shrimps — canned 
may be used. Pour over this four table 
spoonfuls of vinegar, with which is mixed 
a coffee-spoonful of white pepper, half the 
amount of cayenne, the same of celery 
salt and Chili Colorado, if you have them. 
Add two table-spoonfuls of capers. Just 
before serving, mix with it a mayonnaise, 
thinned with lemon juice instead of vine- 
gar. Garnish with lettuce or water-cress.
