PREFACE. 



*' What ! " — the reader may exclaim — ** Another book on cookery 1 
Eave we not Careme and Francatelli, Vatel and Soyer, Ude and 
Gouffd, Miss Acton and Mrs. Beeton, Meg Dodds and Mrs. Hale, 
and scores of other authorities on the same subject ? Must every 
cook be an author, and we be asked to read his^book, as well as to 
eat of the dishes he prepares ? " Gentle reader, it is to anticipate 
this possible state of mind, and to answer these probable questions, 
that this explanatory preface is submitted. Many a dish is cooked 
that is not worth the time and trouble, even by an ordinarily edu- 
cated palate, given to its discussion, and many a book written — 
especially on the subject of Cookery — the reading of which is worse 
than time wasted. There have been innumerable Cook Books for 
popular use published, I grant you; but if you ask nine out of ten 
persons who consult them, they will tell you they become more 
-and more perplexed as they attempt to follow their guidance. 
The housekeeper will confess she has been led into errors by their 
vague recipes, injurious to the family health, and, at the same time, 
expensive to the family purse. It is to dissipate this fog enveloping 
the literature of the kitchen that the publication of the Book of 
American Practical Cookery is undertaken. The author claims 
that the work is the result of a lifetime of study, constant observa- 
tion, and practical experience in the best culinary establishments 
of both Continents. He, therefore, brings to his task a thorough 
knowledge of the subject, and asserts, fearless of successful contra- 
diction, that the result of his labors will be the only competent 
treatise — applying culinary science especially to the material condi- 
tions of this country — ever written. He intends it for a trustworthy 
.guide to all what to eat and drink, and what to avoid.

VI PREFACE. 

In pursuance of the plan laid down, he proposes to embrace 
the whole list of food articles, their selection, treatment, and best 
method of preparing them for the table, showing how the utmost 
value can be obtained from every edible designed by the Almighty 
for the comfort and nourishment of mankind. It is due to the 
intelligence of the present age that there should no longer be room 
for the old sneer of the dyspeptic cynic: " God sends the material,, 
but the Devil sends cooks." 

To accomplish this important object will require at least six 
volumes. Marie Antoine Careme, the great French cook, who lived 
between the years 1784 and 1833, and who was called the ''regen- 
erator of cookery," took twelve volumes to give Europe of his day 
the information which the author of the present series proposes to 
give America of the present, in six. Each volume of the American. 
Practical CooKERY#series will be devoted to a leading food staple. 
This, the first volume, deals with vegetables and all alimentary 
plants, roots, and seeds grown on the American continent, with full 
remarks of the best varieties, their mode of cultivation, cooking, 
dishing, and other matters of interest connected with this branch of 
the culinary art — one, by the way, of no small importance, but to 
which generally scant attention is paid by the household, and even 
by the club and hotel, cook. 

It comes quite in place here to give a few cursory hints on the 
subject-matter more defiuitely and precisely stated in the body of 
this volume. In preparing all alimentary plants for the table, the 
best, freshest, and those in season, should always be chosen. Stale 
or decayed vegetables, or those that have been overheated in pack- 
ing, or bruised in transportation, are unwholesome. Avoid them 
if you value your health. Preserved vegetables should not be used 
for the table, if they can be possibly declined. Where their use 
cannot be avoided, be careful to select those put up at creditable 
establishments, with the name of the proprietor or company, and 
the quality of the goods marked plainly on the package. Often 
flashy and picturesque labels conceal germs of disease, in the shape 
of imperfectly preserved vegetables, sufficient to cause an epidemic. 
Vegetables should only be freely eaten in the spring, because most 
kinds are then seasonable, and consequently wholesome and nutri- 
tious. Some of the few fall varieties are improved by light frosts.

PBEFACE. Vll 

Vegetables forced in hot-houses are not as good as those grown in 
the open air, and subjected to ordinary natural conditions. The 
-variety of climate with which the United States is blessed, promotes 
the growth of every variety of fruit and vegetable known in the 
world, and the facilities for transportation put nearly every section 
of our country on the same footing, so far as the enjoyment at their 
best of the products of each is concerned. 

In cooking vegetables, good pure water is essential. To cook 
green vegetables properly, they should be put into a vessel while 
the water is boiling — the pot remaining uncovered. By this means 
they will retain their natural color. Vegetables can be served with 
each course, or alone, before or after the roast. It is better that 
they precede the roast, as the appetite is thereby improved for the 
course that follows. Too many vegetables should not be served 
with a dinner. They ought to be selected with care according to 
the course they accompany. These hints, although general, will 
serve a good purpose in awakening attention. 

In conclusion, the author may, without egotism, again state, that 
he feels confident in his ability to make this series on American 
Practical Cookery a standard work, because he is practically 
acquainted with the details of every branch on which he writes, 
and, at the same time, familiar with the broader requirements of 
the culinary profession. A chief cook, besides being versed in the 
technique of the. kitchen, should also be a good judge of the kinds, 
qualities and uses of every dietetic article. As the old Greek comic 
poet Dionysius, says: 

" To roast some beef, to carve with neatness, 
To blow Tip sauces, and to blow the fire, 
Is anybody's task; he who does this 
Is but a seasoner and a broth-maker. 
A cook is quite another thing. His mind 
Must comprehend bll facts and circumstances, 
Where is the place, and what the time of supper, 
Who are the guests, and who the entertainer. 
What fish he ought to buy, and where he ought to buy it," etc. 

The author does not expect to realize a fortune by this publica- 
tion. The work is, in a degree, a labor of love, prompted as much 
by a desire to benefit the culinary art, as by any other feeling. But

VIU PREFACE. 

though his reward may not reach the munificent one of Antony's 
cook, who received a city for his skill in arranging a Cleopatra ban- 
quet, he feels assured at least of the gratitude of all those who wish 
to intelligently enjoy the pleasures of the table, and of the hearty 
appreciation of his fellow-workers in the important field of culinary 

science.

GLOSSARY 



OF- 



WORDS AND TERMS USED IN THIS BOOK, 



Alkmande, — Allemande sauce is not of German origin, as the name 
would imply, but is the mother and stock of the white French 
sauces. It is made with veal ^nd chicken broth, and is then called 
Veloutee. After this the yolks of eggs, lemon juice, and essence 
of mushrooms are added. It is fully described in the " Book 
on Sauces." When this sauce can not be made conveniently a 
substitute can be made by thickening a veal or chicken broth, 
the same as for butter sauce, letting it boil for fifteen minutes. 
Put the yolks of four raw eggs in a saucepan with four spoon- 
fuls of cream, and mix in slowly one quart of the thickened 
veal or chicken sauce. Add the juice of one lemon, season 
with salt, pepper, and nutmeg, and set it on the fire. Stir it 
continually until it boils, then strain it through a sauce towel. 
Put it in a saucepan and plAce small pieces of butter on top to 
prevent a crust from forming. 

AmiiiaL — Annual plants are those that must be sown every year. 

'Aroma. — The quality or principle of plants or seeds that constitutes 
their fragrance. An agreeable odor. 

Aromatic , — ^A plant characterized by a pleasant smell, and usually 
by a warm, pungent taste. 

Bain-maHe, — Literally a hot water bath. A Bain-marie is a square 
pan in which hot water is kept, and is used to keep saucepans 
in that contain sauces or stews, that are to be kept warm before 
serving. The water must be kept almost at the boiling heat, 
but never allowed to boil. The name Bain-marie is also applied 
to the high saucepans that are made expressly to sit in the 
above mentioned Bain-marie pans. 

Biennial, — Biennial plants are those that last for two years and then 
perish. 

Blanch. — ^To whiten the stalks or leaves of a plant by earthing them 
up or tying them together to exclude the light.

XX GL088ABY. 

Braise. — ^To cook or stew in a close-covered saucepan or other vessel 
on a slow fire. Formerly hot coals were put on the cover to 
keep the heat even, but an oven is much better and warms the 
vessel thoroughly. 

Bi^isk Fire. — One burning with a quick, free action. 

Butter. — When the expression "add apiece of butter'' is used, it 
depends on the quantity of vegetables cooked. For four per- 
sons, add a piece as large as a walnut. For soups, add from 
four to six ounces. When it is added, toss the vegetables well 
over until the butter is melted. In soups, keep stirring until 
the butter is melted. In this way it thoroughly permeates the 
article being cooked, and gives it a glossy, velvety appearance. 
If it is not stirred, it will remain on the top and impart a greasy 
appearance to the food. 

Calyx. — ^The outer covering of a flower. 

Uapsnle. — ^The seed vessel of a plant. 

Catechu. — A dry, brown, astringent extract, obtained by decoction 
and evaporation from the Acacia Catechu, in India. It contains 
a portion of tannin or tannic acid. 

Cellulose. — ^The substance left after the action of solvents on vege- 
table tissues. It is convertible into starch and sugar. 

Chopped. — The term "chopped" parsley or onions is used often. 
Before being chopped, parsley must be washed, then dried in a 
towel; the large stems must be removed, and then the leaves 
are chopped. Then put it in a towel and wring out the moist- 
ure; after this dip it in boiling water for a minute, then immerse 
it in cold water and squeeze it dry. By doing this it will retain 
its green color in cooking. Onions should not be chopped or 
they will turn black; they should be cut finely. Parboiled 
vegetables, such as spinach or cabbage, should be drained first 
and then dried before being chopped on a board. Garlic has 
a stronger flavor when mashed than when chopped. 

Clarify. — ^To make clear. Applied principally to butter, which 
should be melted over a slow fire and then strained through a 
napkin. 

Coagulate. — To curdle or thicken; to change from a liquid to a solid 
mass. 

Colander. — A vessel with the bottom perforated with little holes for 
straining. 

Com/rey. — A genus of plants that abound in mucilage. An emol- 
lient drink is made from the roqts.

the young plants to remain until the following spring, then set them 
out two feet asunder, in each direction. The stalk, which is a 
cylindrical, hollow, herbaceous stem, will be fit for use by June of 
the following year. If the flower stem is removed, as it makes its 
appearance, the plants will put forth fresh sprouts from the sides 
of the root, and survive three years, but when allowed to blossom 
and perfect their seeds the plants soon perish.

Article VII. 



French ARTICHOKE. Geniuui 

Arlichaut. Artishoke, 

No. 18. — Artichokes were first discovered in Italy, but are now 
planted in all large gardens in the United States, and are used as 
a vegetable, and prepared for the table in various ways. There are 
five kinds of Artichokes, viz : The Violet, the White, the Green, 
the Bed, and the Sweet. They are called the Globe Artichokes, 
which diflfer from the Jerusalem Artichoke. The Sweet Artichoke 
is preferable to all others for its delicious flavor. It grows very 
small, and its plants are very productive for two years. It is rare 
yet in this country. The Green, which is the variety in general 
use, is large and juicy. The Bed, which is more delicate than the 
Green, is picked when young, and is mostly used for eating in the 
raw state, or in salad. The Violet grows as large as the Green, but 
is not as profitable in culture. The White is very productive, but 
very troublesome to raise, and owing to this is very rare in the 
market. 

Artichokes when eaten raw take long to digest, but when cooked 
are very agreeable. They are cooked in various ways as a vegetable 
for the table, and are used for garnitures and soups. 

CULTUBE. 

No. 19. — Sow in April in rich soil, and transplant the following 
spring to permanent beds, in rows or drills, three feet apart and 
two feet between the plants. The first season will only give a par- 
tial crop, but as it is a perennial, after being once planted the beds 
will remain in bearing for years. They should be protected in 
winter by a covering of leaves or coarse manure. 

GBEEN lABGE GLOBE. 

No. 20. — Is the best for general culture and use. The edible 
portion is the undeveloped flower heads, which should be used be- 
fore they begin to open, and the stalk should then be cut to the 
ground, for if the flowers expand they weaken the plant. In the 
large Globe the buds are large — nearly round; scales deep green, 
shading to purple, very thick and fleshy, the bottom of which is the 
edible part.

Frenek ASPARAGUS. Germmm 

Aeperge. Spargel. 

No. 65. — ^The Asparagus is one of the best table vegetables, 
having a delicious flavor, and being easily prepared. It can be 
had nearly all the year round, but is best when in season. To have 
them at perfection they need great care in their cultivation. The 
best flavored and most tender are those raised under cover and kept 
from the rays of the sun. There are four varieties: the green, 
violet, white and wild Asparagus. The white is savory and agree-

able for eating whole, but contains little substance. The violet 
grows large and is very substantial and preferred by all gourmets. 
The green is smaller and more common and is generally used for 
soups and purees. The wild is used for medical purposes. The 
water in which Asparagus has been boiled, when cold, is a refresh- 
ing drink, and can be used to advantage by persons troubled with 
kidney complaint. 

CULTURE 

No. 66. — Sow early in spring, as soon as the ground will admit 
of working, in rows a foot apart. Keep carefully hoed and clear 
from weeds, and the plant will be in condition to set out in the suc- 
ceeding spring. The soil for the permanent beds should be thor- 
oughly manured and trenched or plowed to a depth of at least one 
foot. Plant in rows, spread the roots well out and let the crown of 
the plant be set deep enough so that it will be covered from five to 
eight inches. In heavy soil the covering must be less than in 
light soil. After sowing the seeds, tread them firmly in with the feet. 

COLOSSAL. 

No. 67. — ^The best variety, unrivaled in size, deep green in color, 
tender and good in quality. 

GIANT. 

No. 68. — A popular variety, producing green and purple shoots, 
according to the soil. It grows very hardy but not as large as the 
Colossal. 

CROSSBRED. 

No. 69. — ^It retains the head closed until the stalks are quite 
long and is of a uniform color, while for tenderness and quality it 
is unsurpassed. The size is medium large, and uniform* 

SMALL DEFIANCE. 

No. 70. — ^Is of a rich green color, very early, good sized, tender, 
and good quality.

No. 97. — ^The Asparagus Bean is a distinct variety from the gar- 
den bean, being a native of the southern part of South America 
and China. The pods measure over one foot in length, and the

BALM. ^ 

Baume, MeUtse, 

No. 98. — Balm is a hardy perennial aromatic plant. Originally 
from the southern part of Europe. The leaves have a fragrant 
odor, similar to lemons, and are used for making Balm Tea, for use 
in fever, and makes a pleasant beverage of Balm wine for diseases 
of the lungs, being also used in seasoning meats and for flavoring 
vinegar. A mixture of Balm and honey is sometimes applied to 
the interior of bee hives just previous to receiving the swarm for 
the purpose of their settlement, to attract them. 

CULTURE. 

No. 99. — ^Prepare a rich sandy soil and keep it clear of weeds. 
Plant early and thin to ten inches apart. The plants will soon 
completely cover the ground, and the bed with good management 
vnll last several years. When drying, the plants should be cut as 
they come into bloom, separating the stems at the surface of the 
ground. Spread them in an airy shady place and allow them to dry 
gradually. The leaves may be used in their green state directly 
from the plants, as they are required.

BARLEY. 

Orge, Oertte. 

No. 101. — ^The common Barley is a cereal, the flour obtained 
from its grains containing very little gluten, but an abundance of 
fecula, also containing a mucilaginous substance. For this reason 
it produces a bread less savory and less digestible than other flours. 
The Pearl Barley, when entirely removed of its pellicle, is reduced 
to a small pearl. It is much used for culinary purposes in replac- 
ing rice, and also in making soups for invalids. 

COMMON BARLEY. 

No. 102. — ^Barley succeeds best in lands more sandy and lighter 
than those adapted to wheat. It is sown in the spring and can be 
grown further north than any other grain. Unless intended for 
seed, it should be cut before being fully ripe, as it is then heavier, 
of better quality, and less liable to shell. The land should always 
be rolled immediately after sowing. 

BARLEY MANSURY. 

No. 103. — This is a six-rowed Barley with long, heavy well filled 
heads, containing large plump grains. The straw is bright, very 
strong, and is not apt to lodge even in the richest lands. Bipens 
a week later than the common six-rowed Barley, or about the same 
time as two-rowed Barley.

as String Beans. Later on they get hulled, when the seeds are ripe, 
and are called the Shell Bean (French, Flageolet). Next they are 
dried and then prepared in various ways. The White Marrow Fat, 
the Golden Wax. and the Dwarf Soisson are among the best varie- 
ties. To have Beans well cooked pure water must be used, some 
varieties having hard shells, which will not boil tender. This can 
be remedied by adding some carbonate of soda while they are being 
boiled. For early cultivation the American Garden Bush Bean is 
the earliest and hardiest. The Garden Bush or Pole Bunning Beans 
are tender annual plants, originally from the East Indies. The 
dwarf varieties require no poles or sticks for their support.

thoroughly cooked remove the faggot and carrots, leaving the leek, 
celery, and onions, if desired. Then rub the soup through a fine 
sieve and season it properly. 

NOTES ON BEANS. 

No. 205. — When beans are boiled with salt pork they should not 
be seasoned too much, as the pork itself contains considerable salt. 

The pork should be washed in cold water and care taken not to 
use any that is rancid. 

When bacon is used, trim it and then parboil it for five minutes. 
Then immerse it in cold water to remove the smoky taste. 

Dry Beans should first be carefully picked, as there are always 
small stones and pieces of earth mixed with them. Wash them 
well in cold water, and allow them to soak in fresh water over 
night. 

When dry Beans are soaked in lukewarm water, and the water is 
several times renewed, they will cook much quicker than when 
soaked in cold water.

Frecc!! BEETS. 

Betterave, Rnnktl Rube. 

No. 206. — ^The Beet is a hardy biennial root plant of a blood-red 
color. It contains a large substance of sugar and is much used as 
a vegetable, for salads, and as a relish. It is refreshing and nu- 
tritious when properly prepared. There are five varieties of Beets. 
The Swiss chard, or sea-kale Beet, is a distinct vegetable and much 
superior to the common Beet for greens. If sown at the same time 
as the common varieties, it will be fit to use before them. Later 
on the plants form broad, flat, beautiful white and wax- like stems 
to the leaves, which are very delicious when cooked. The young 
leaves of the common varieties are cooked with sorrel, or cooked 
and prepared the same as spinach. Still another variety is called 
the mangel, which is seldom used for the table. 

CULTURE. 

No. 207. — ^The soil which is suitable for the culture of the Beet 
is that which is rather light than otherwise, provided always that it 
is thoroughly enriched by manure. Sow them in drills one foot 
apart and two inches deep. When the plants have attained three 
or four leaves then thin them out so they may stand five or six 
inches apart. Keep them free from weeds by hand weeding or 
hoeing. In October the roots may be taken up and stored in the 
cellar or in pits outside, like potatoes, care being taken that they 
are not bruised or injured in the process. 

EGYPTIAN BEET TURNIP. 

No. 208. — ^The earliest Beet and one of the leading market sorts, 
having a deep crimson color^ 

bastian's blood turnip. 

No. 209. — ^An early variety of a blood red color, when properly 
cooked. 

dewing's blood beet. 

No. 210. — ^The roots are of a deep blood red color. It is of fine 
form and flavor, very early and an excellent variety.

No. 211. — Chiefly valuable for its earliness. 

LONG SMOOTH BLOOD RED. 

No. 212. — An excellent late variety. 

EARLY YELLOW BEET. 

213. — Similar to the blood red, but ditferent in color. The flesh 
is yellow, tender and sweet. 

PINE APPLE BEET. 

No. 214. — A highly esteemed English variety of rich deep crim- 
son color. 

BRAZILL^N VARIEGATED. 

No. 215. — Beautiful for garnishing and flower garden decoration. 
The stems and veins are richly colored with crimson, yellow and 
white. 

SWISS CHARD, OR SEA KALE BEET. 

No. 216..— This variety is cultivated solely for its leaves. The 
midrib is stewed and served the same as asparagus, and the other 
parts of the leaves are used like spinach. If it is cut often, new 
and more tender leaves will be produced. 

HOW TO PREPARE BEETS FOR COOKING. 

No. 217, — Beets when young are prepared as a vegetable for the 
table. They must be boiled whole, without having anything cut 
from them except the tops. These must always be cut an inch from 
the root and care taken not to injure the root, for if it is in any way 
injured the beet will lose its fl&vor and color. When boiled let 
them get cold, then peel or rub oflf the skin and prepare as needed. 

BOILED BEETS STEWED. 

No. 218. — Boil the Beets, and when done skin and slice them.. 
If large, cut them in two and put them in a saucepan. Season with 
salt and pepper and add a piece of butter, tossing them over the 
fire. Serve hot, or boil a glass of vinegar with a piece of butter, 
seasoned with salt and pepper, and pour it over the Beets.

STEWED BEETS, HANOVERIAN STYLE. 

No. 219. — Boil one dozen ordinary sized Beets and when done skin 
and slice them. Put into a saucepan one fine chopped white onion 
with a piece of butter. Fry it lightly and then add a wine-glassful 
of vinegar. When it boils add the sliced beets and four ounces of 
butter. Season with salt and pepper. Toss them over occasionally 
until thoroughly warmed, and before serving add some fine 
chopped parsley. 

STEWED BEETS, WITH CREAM SAUCE. 

No. 220. — Make a Cream sauce seasoned with salt, pepper, nutmeg 
and corianderi Add the sliced Beets, and, when thoroughly 
warmed, serve them. 

STEWED BEETS, WITH BUTTER SAUCE.

a few spoonfuls of Butter sauce, tossing them well over, and before 
serving add some fine chopped parsley. 

STEWED BEETS, ST. IGNATIUS. 

No. 222. — Chop a white onion fine and put it into a saucepan 
with four ounces of butter. Fry it lightly and then add two soup 
spoonfuls of flour. Cook to a light brown, while stirring it with a 
wooden spoon. Dilute this with a small wine-glassful of vinegar 
and some white broth to make a light sauce. Add three dozen 
young boiled Beets, cut into quarters, allowing them to simmer for 
fifteen minutes. 

ROAST BEETS. 

No. 223. — Use medium sized Beets. Kub them with a towel 
well impregnated with brandy, lay them on a wire crate and place 
it into a roasting pan. This mode will permit them to cook more 
evenly, as it takes about six hours to have them properly done. 
The crust of the Beet will then be carbonized. In cooking Beets, 
in this manner all the sugary substance of the Beet concentrates in 
the center. It makes a most delicious dish, but is seldom prepared 
in this way in consequence of the time used in cooking. 

BEETS FOR GARNITURE. 

No. 224. — When the Beets are boiled, rub oflf the skin and trim 
them. Place them whole in earthen jars, covering them with 
4

parsley or chives. Then cover each of these with the other slices 
of Beets, pressing each of them well together. Dip them into 
frying batter and fry in hot lard. Drain them on a napkin and dish 
them up and garnish with fried parsley. 

Nora.— Burnet or chivee finely chopped may be used with the p&rsley In seanoning them. 

BEET SUGAR. 

No. 226. — Beets are largely cultivated for the manufacture of 
sugar, which was first made about 1812, by a French chemist, dur- 
ing the blockade and siege of the First Empire. Beet sugar is 
cheaper than that made from the cane, but is not so profitable in 
its use. 

BEET JU;CE FOR SOUPS. 

No. 227, — Beet juice is made for certain kinds of Polish soups, as 
is explained in the book on soups. Peel and cut in quarters enough 
of the finest kind of red beets to fill a small barrel. After putting 
them in the barrel pour in a sufficient quantity of cold water t-o 
cover them. Then put a linen cloth over the top and the cover 
over that. Place the barrel where the temperature is mild, to allow 
the liquid to ferment. In eight or ten days drain otf the liquid and 
use it as directed. If bread crumbs or barley is used it will bring 
on fermentation much quicker. 

BEET SALAD WITH VEGETABLES. 

No. 228. — Beets mixed with corn salad, lamb lettuce or celery 
make a fine salad. 

Tounj^ Beets sliced, with an equal proportion of artichoke 
bottoms, potatoes, white beans and glazed onions, and seasoned 
with salt, pepper, vinegar and olive oil, and nicely arranged in a

Ben. Bene, 

No. 232. — Bene is said to have been introduced from Africa. It 
is a hardy annual plant, much used in the Southern States. The 
seeds are used for food (being first parched), stewed with meats, 
and are also used for puddings — the same as rice. An oil is 
extracted from the seed, which does not easily become rancid, and 
is used for softening and whitening the skin. The leaves, if 
immersed in a tumbler of water, will convert it into a mucilaginous 
drink, very beneficial in cases of cholera-infantum and diarrhoea.

No. 261. — This is a hard}- annuiil. The root leaves are put forth 
horizontally, and spread reguhwly about a common center, somewhat 
in the form of a rosette. The plant is cultivated for its leaves, 
which are used as a salad. They should be plucked while young 
and tender, or when half-grown. 

CULTURE.

Buckwheat fiour is made into batter, it makes a winter breakfast 
dish well known to and appreciated by all Americans. Buckwheat, 
when made into bread, is only good while in its fresh state, for as 
soon as it becomes dry it splits, and on being cut, crumbles into 
small pieces and becomes hard to digest. 

COMMON BUCKWHEAT. 

No. 264. — Buckwheat should be sown about the middle of June, 
and should be threshed as soon as it is dry, on the ground of a 
barn floor. If allowed to stand in mass it quickly gathers moisture. 

SILVER HULLED BUCKWHEAT. 

No. 265. — This variety is a great improvement on the ordi- 
nary Buckwheat. Sown at the same time as the common Buck- 
wheat, it continues in bloom longer, matures earlier, and yields 
nearly double under the same conditions. The grain is of a 
beautiful light gray color, varying slightly in shade, and the comers 
are much less prominent than in the ordinary variety, while the 
husk is thinner, thereby saving twenty per cent, in the process of 
manufacturing into flour. 

BUCKWHEAT CAKES WITH YEAST. 

No. 266. — Put three pounds of Buckwheat flour into a pan, and 
make a hole in the center of the flour. Four into this three pints 
of water, two ounces of dissolved compressed yeast, and two 
tablespoonfuls of salt, and mix them slowly to make a light batter 
without lumps. Gather the sides together, cover the pan with a 
cloth and set it in a warm place overnight to raise. Next morning 
mix it up gently before baking. 

Note.— When a little Byrtip is added to the batter in the morning, they will bake to a nicer 
color. A bandfnl or two of com meal Is often added while mixing the Buckwheat flonr. 

BUCKWHEAT CAKES WITH BAKING POWDER. 

No. 267. — Put into a pan three pounds of Buckwheat flour and 
three soup-spoonfuls of baking powder. Mix them up well, and 
make a hole in the center of the flour, into which pour three pints 
of luke-warm water and two tablespoonfuls of salt and mix to a 
light batter. Ten minutes after mixing, bake it. Should the 
cakes not be light enough, add a little more baking powder, as the 
majority of baking powders are very unreliable. 

NoTB.— There is to be had a prepared Buckwheat flour, which is much preferable for small 
famlUes. Thie flour is easily prepared, it being only necessary to use luke-warm water and salt, but 
the batter must be used as soon as mixed.

BAKING OF BUCKWHEAT CAKES, 

No. 268. — Much depends on the cooking of the cakes to have 
them done properly. First, the griddle must always'be very clean, 
heated evenly, and should not be allowed to get burning hot. Grease 
it lightly with leaf lard, and drop enough batter to make ordinary 
sized cakes. Let them cook on one side before turning them, and 
serve them hot with sugar or syrup.

rrcneh CABBAGE. Ger 

Chouxpomm4. Kopf tcokl. 

No. 273. — ^The Cabbage is a biennial plant and is propagated from 
seed sown annually. Cabbage is a plant extensively used and is 
prepared in various ways. It is very nutritious and there are many 
varieties. The white, the green and the red may be had all the 
3'ear round. The cauliflower, brocoli, Brussels sprouts and kale all 
belong to the Cabbage family. Cabbage should be well cooked, 
otherwise it will cause indigestion. In boiling Cabbage, if the water 
is changed, it will remove that strong odor disliked by many. To 
preserve Cabbage during winter, pull them on a dry day and turn 
them over on their heads for a few hours so as to let them drain. 
Set them in a cool cellar or bury them with their heads down in 
long trenches in a dry situation. In the Middle States bury the 
heads and parts of the stump in the open ground, placing over them 
a light covering of straw or boards to protect them from severe 
weather. The Savoy Cabbage is the best of the white sorts. The 
red Cabbage is formed the same as the other Cabbages, and only 
differs from them in color, and is preferred by many to the other 
sorts. It is best in the fall and throughout winter and keeps well, 
but the outer leaves must be occasionally removed, or else they 
will decay. 

CULTURE. 

No. 274. — For the successful culture of Cabbage the very best 
quality of seed must be used. A heavy moist and fresh loam is most 
suitable, and should be highly manured, as well as deeply worked. 
The early sorts should be sown very early in hot beds, hardened 
off and transplanted eighteen to twenty inches apart, early in the 
spring. In the South, sow them from the middle of September to 
the middle of October, and transplant into cold frames, to preserve 
them through the winter, setting them into open ground as early 
as possible. The late autumn and winter varieties may be sown 
from the middle to the last of spring, and transplanted when about 
six inches high, three feet apart each way. Shade and water the 
late sowings in dry weather to get them up. It is important that 
the plants should stand thinly in the seed bed, or they will run up 
weak and slender, and be liable to make long stumps. In 
transplanting they must be set in the ground up to the first leaf, 
no matter how long the stem may be. Cabbages should be hoed

72 HABDER'S AMERICAN COOKERY. 

SAUER KRAUT. 

No. 326. — Sauer Kraut is a German preparation and is highly 
esteemed by tliem, when well prepared. It is made in large quanti- 
ties in this country, especially in the Northern States. It is seldom 
made in private families here, as it can be so readily procured of 
dealers at all times. To make good Sauer Kraut, only the best of 
cabbage heads should be used. When prepared to keep for a 
certain length of time, use new barrels, or those which have con- 
tained vinegar or white wine. Sauer Kraut is cabbage cut into fine 
shreds, pickled in salt, and made to ferment in the barrel. To keep 
it well preserved, it must be kept in a cool and even temperature, 
and must be kept well pressed under the brine. It is an agreeable 
vegetable to be eaten with salted meats. 

SAUER KRAUT, HOW TO MAKE. 

No. 327. — Take a barrel and knock out the head. Then set it in 
a stationary place half a foot from the ground, in a cool and even 
temperature. Bore a hole in the barrel, about two inches from the 
bottom, and put therein a wooden faucet with a strainer inside of 
the barrel. Now select as many cabbages as are needed to fill the 
barrel, using only the best, solid white sorts procurable. Trim off 
the green leaves and cut out the stalks, then cut the cabbage into 
fine, short shreds, using a slide-board which has three or four 
knives, which are made for such a purpose. Place the slide-board 
over a wooden tub to receive the cabbage when it is cut up. Put a 
layer of salt in the bottom of the barrel, and then a layer of cabbage 
two inches thick. Add salt again, then cabbage, and thus alternate 
until the barrel is full. To every thirty pounds of cabbage use one 
and a half pounds of fine salt. 

NoTB.— A few bay leaves, carraway or anise seed, may be added with the layers of cabbage, but 
should be used only with moderation. 

When the barrel is full, cover the top with a layer of cabbage 
leaves, and spread a linen cloth over this, placing on top of the 
cloth a wooden cover, made to go inside the barrel, and on this 
cover place some heavy weight that will press the cover down very 
tight. Five days after let the brine run off and add the same quan- 
tity of fresh brine, changing it once every sixth day until the brine 
has been changed four times, or until the brine runs clear and 
without odor. To keep Kraut from moulding, the brine must always 
cover the cabbage. Two months after the Kraut is first put in the 
barrel it will be ready for use. Care must be taken to always keep 
the Kraut covered after any of it has been taken from the barrel for 
use.

Citrouille on Potiron. Kurbia. 

No. 336. — ^The Calabash is of the same family as the squash and 
pumpkin. The fruit, when young, is hairy on the outside, and quite 
soft and tender. The surface, however, becomes hard, smooth and 
glossy when the fruit is ripe. The fruit is only fit for use when 
young, and it is then pickled in vinegar, the same as cucumbers. 
The flesh, when fully ripe, is worthless, but the shells, which are 
hard, light, compact and very strong, are used in the manufacture 
of baskets and for many ornamental purposes. There are four 
varieties: the Bottle Gourd, the Hercules Club, the Powder Horn, 
and the Siphon Gourd. They are cultivated in the same manner as 
squash or pumpkins.

FRneh CARROT. 

Carrote. Afoehre, 

No. 373. — ^The Carrot is a biennial root, somewhat hardy, and is 
one of the most healthful and nutritious of garden roots. It is 
extensively used as a vegeteble for the table, and for seasoning and 
garnitures. It contains a certain amount of sugar, which adds to 
its nutritious quality. There are several different varieties, all of 
which can be obtained all the year round. The larger varieties are 
also cultivated as an agricultural root, and are better suited than 
other kinds of food for dairy cattle, not alone because they are 
nutritious, but because they impart a good color and flavor to the 
butter. 

CULTUBE. 

No. 374. — ^The Carrot succeeds best in light, sandy loam, made 
rich by manuring the previous year. The roots often grow pronged 
and ill -shaped, in imperfectly manured ground. It is better to sow 
as early in spring as the ground can be got ready^ but if planting is 
necessarily delayed until late in the season, the seed must be soaked 
in tepid water twenty-four hours, then dry it by mixing in sifted 
ashes, and sow it in fully prepared soil.

HOW TO PREPARE CARROTS FOR COOKING. 

No. 385. — Carrots should always be scraped, and should only be 
prepared when ready for use. When young use them as a vegeta- 
ble, and prefer those that are stunt rooted. Cook them whole, or 
cut them in small parts. The large carrots are cut in difierent 
shapes, with spoon cutters, for garnitures, but when used as a veg- 
etable, cut them in a short, thick Julienne. When used for Julienne 
soup, cut them two inches crosswii^e; then slice them, and cut them 
lengthwise in small stems. When they get older, use only the red 
part, which you peel oflf by cutting it the same thickness. In this 
way the pieces will stay whole, but in the other way the pieces will 
break oflf when cooked.

FroKCJ CATERPILLAR. German 

Scorpiare. Raupenpflanzen, 

No. 404. — A hardy annual plant with creeping stems, that are 
about two feet in length. The seeds are produced in pods. No 
part of the plant is eatable, but the pods, in their green state, are 
placed upon dishes of salad, and so closely do they resemble a real 
caterpillar, that they will oftentimes deceive the uninitiated. 

CULTURE. 

No. 405. — Sow them in April, fifteen inches apart, in rows that 
are fifteen inches wide. 



Article XL. 



CATNIP. 

Nepeta. Katzenkraut^ 

No. 406. — ^This is a hardy perennial plant, well known as a mild 
nervine for infants. The plant should be pulled up by the roots 
when in full flower, and dried in the shade.

Article XLII. 



Trench CAULIFLOWER iiemiMi 

Ohoufleur. Blumen Kohl. 

No. 409. — ^The Cauliflower, like Brocoli, is an annual plant, being 
delicious in flavor. It requires a cool, moist atmosphere to bring 
it to perfection, and if this condition occurs when the plant is about 
to head, fine large heads will result, whereas, if the air is hot and 
dry, failure will result in spite of the best of seeds and cultivation. 
Brocoli is a species of Cauliflower, and both are prepared in the 
same style. See Brocoli, Article XXIII. 

CULTURE. 

No. 410. — For the spring or summer crop, sow the early varieties, 
about the last of winter, in hot-beds, and transplant them into the 
open air as soon as the ground can be worked. For the late autumn 
crop, sow the late varieties about the middle of spring, and trans- 
plant them as you would winter cabbages. Jd dry weather water 
them freely, and as they advance in growth hoe deep and draw 
earth to the stems. After they begin to head they should be watered 
every other day. In two or three weeks the strongest will begin to 
form flower heads, which should be cut for use while the curd is close 
and compact. It is then tender and delicious, but later on the head 
opens and separates into branches and soon becomes coarse, fibrous, 
strongly flavored, and unfit for use. The leaves should be gathered 
and tied loosely over the tops of the heads to facilitate blanching. 
On the approach of frost, those plants that have not headed may 
be set out in a cellar and can be aired in mild weather. 

EARLY SNOWBALL. 

No. 411. — This is the earliest of all Cauliflowers. Its heads 
measure from 8 to 9 inches in diameter. Every plant forms a fine 
head. Its dwarf habit and short interleaves allow it to be planted 
as close as 18 inches apart each way. This variety does equally 
well for late planting.

should be ^rawn, packed in sand, and stored in the cellar before 
severe weather sets in. It is used in the same manner as the 
common celery. Its root, or bulb, is the only part eaten. Its flesh 
is white and tender, having the flavor of the stalks of common 
celery, though less mild and delicate. The leaf-stalk is used most 
for flavoring soups, and the bulbs are stewed or used in salad the 
same as celery. 

CULTURE. 

No. 435.— Sew it early in spring, in light, rich soil, and transplant 
it in May into beds, and water it freely in dry weather. When the 
plants are almost full grown, it is customary to earth up the bulbs 
to the height of four or five inches. In about a month they will be 
sufficiently blanched for use. The roots, which resemble turnips, 
will be ready in October, and may be preserved in sand during 
winter. It is a vegetable that is much esteemed for culinary pur- 
poses. 

LARGE ERFURT. 

No. 436. — ^This is a variety of Celeriac, having turnip-shaped 
roots, which may be cooked and sliced, and used with vinegar, to 
make an excellent salad. It is more hardy, and may be used in the 
same manner as celery.

No. 437. — This is a great improvement over the old variety, 
having small foliage, and large, round and smooth tubers. 

CELERIAC FRIED, VILLEROI. 

No. 438. — Pare and then wash six Celeriac roots in cold water 
and cut them in quarters. Take oflF the hard part, trim them 
in scallops, parboil them for 15 minutes, and drain them. Then 
put them in a flat saucepan lined with slices of fat pork and moisten 
them with white broth. Season with salt, pepper, nutmeg and a 
pinch of sugar. Then cover them with thin slices of fat pork, put 
them on the fire and let them cook slowly. When cooked take out 
the Celeriac and dry them on a napkin. Then strain the gravy in 
another saucepan and add four spoonfuls of AUemande sauce. Ee- 
duce it on a brisk fire and when cool dip the Celeriac in the sauce. 
Then arrange them in a pan and set them in a cool place, and when 
they are cold and the sauce adheres to the Celeriac, bread them in 
fresh bread crumbs. Then dip them in beaten eggs and bread them 
again. Fry them in hot lard and serve on a dish having a puree 
of Celeriac in the center.

FreBcli CELERY. Cerman 

Celeri. SelUru 

No. 448. — Celery is a hafdy, umbelliferous biennial plant, and is 
always propagated from seed. The stems of the leaves are the parts 
of the plant that are used. These, after being blanched, are exceed- 
ingly crisp and tender, having an agreeable and peculiar aromatic 
flavor. They are prepared in various ways, but are generally served 
raw, for a relish, with salt or with oil, vinegar and mustard sauce. 
They are almost indispensable for salads.

CULTQRE. 

No. 449. — Sow the seed in shallow boxes, or in a finely prepared 
bed out of doors, in straight rows, so that the small plants may be 
kept free from weeds. When about two inches high, thin them out 
and transplant them so they will stand two inches apart. When 
they are about four inches high cut off the tops, which will cause 
them to grow stocky. The crop is usually an early one, and if good 
plants are used, they may be set out as late as the middle of August. 
The best results, however, are obtained by setting them out in the 
middle of June or the first of July. When setting them out, prepare 
broad, shallow trenches, about six inches deep and four feet apart, 
in which the plants should be set six inches apart. Cut off the 
outer leaves and press the soil firmly about the roots. In about six 
weeks the plants should be handled, which is done by having one 
man gather the leaves together while a second man draws the earth 
about the plant to one-third of its height, being careful that none 
of the earth falls between the leaves, as that would cause them to 
rust or rot. In a few days draw more earth around them, and repeat 
this process every few days until only the tops of the leaves are 
visible. In a few days more it will be fit for use. Do not disturb 
the plants when the ground is wet, as that will injure them. 

At the approach of severe, freezing weather, take up the plants 
and put them in a light cellar or an unused frame, where the tem- 
perature can be kept above the freezing point. Set them out 
compactly, so that all but the tops of the leaves can be covered with 
sand. They will then gradually blanch, and may be used throughout 
the winter.

No. 481. — This is a small annual herbaceous plant, which grows 
wild. It is about a foot high, having a branching stem which 
divides above into pairs, and bears oval, smooth pointed leaves, 
direct from the stem. The flowers are rose colored. The herb has 
no odor, but has a strong bitter taste, and its tonic properties are 
similar to those of gentian. It is used in cases of dyspepsia and 
fever. The roots make a valuable yellow dye. The flowers are 
gathered in bunches, hung in a dark, airy, warm room, and when 
thoroughly dried are kept in boxes, in a dry place. They are used

CHAMOMILE. 

Camomille. Camomile, 

No. 432. — The single and double flowering Chamomile are propa- 
gated by slips, with a few of the small roots attached, both kinds 
being claimed as hardy perennials. In the Northern States the 
plants are frequently destroyed by severe frost. The single Chamo- 
mile, though considered more efficacious for medicinal purposes, is 
not cultivated as much as the double flowering variety. They may 
be grown from leaves or slips. The leaves, when cut fine and 
burned, emit a peculiar, pungent odor. The flowers, which are the 
parts generally used, are in high repute, both in the popular and 
scientific materia medica, and give out their properties by infusion in 
either water or alcohol. The flowers are also used in the manufac- 
ture of bitter beer, and along with wormwood are used to a certain 
extent as a substitute for hops. It is considered a safe bitter and 
tonic, though strong infusions, when taken warm, act sometimes as 
an emetic. 

CULTURE. 

No. 483. — Chamomile flourishes best in light poor soil, and is 
generally propagated by dividing the roots and setting them in rows 
that are a foot apart with the plants ten inches from each other. 
They grow fast and soon entirely cover the ground.

part of the stem is considered better and more tender, and has a 
milder flavor than other varieties, though it is less productive.

Frcncb COMMON CHIVES. C^ermaB 

Cibaulette. Schnittlauch, 

No. 506. — The Chive is a hardy, bulbous-rootecl perennial plant. 
The leaves, which are produced in tufts, are seven or eight inches 
long, erect and cylindrical in shape. The young leaves are the parts 
of the plant used, and to keep them in a fresh and tender condition 
the plants should be frequently shorn to the ground. They possess 
the flavor peculiar to the onion family, and are principally used as 
an ingredient in soups and spring salads. For omelets the Chive is 
considered almost indispensable. ( See omelet with herbs.) 

CULTURE. 

No. 507. — As the plant seldom, if ever, produces seeds, it is 
always propagated by a division of the roots or bulbs. The bulbs 
are planted in May, two or three together, in rows 15 inches apart, 
and covered three inches deep. They require little attention, and 
increase rapidly. If not cut to excess, a plant will continue for 
years. 



Article LVI. 



CHUFA, OR EARTH NUT. 
Glun de terre, Erdnus, 

No. 508. — This is a perennial plant that originated in the south 
of Europe. The roots are long and fibrous, and produce at their 
extremities numerous oblong, jointed, pale brown tubers, about the 
size of a filbert. The flesh of the tubers is tender, having a yellowish 
color, and a pleasant, sweet, nut-like flavor. When the tubers are 
dried they taste somewhat like almonds, and keep a long time. 
When dried and pulverized, they impart to water the color and 
richness of milk. They are eaten raw or roasted. 

CULTURE. 

No. 509. — They succeed well in California. Plant the tubers in 
April, two inches deep, in da-ills two feet apart. They will be ready 
for harvesting in October.

CINNAMON. 

Canndle, Zimmet. 

No. 511. — The tree which produces the Cinnamon is supposed to 
have come originally from the Island of Ceylon, and is called the 
Cinnamon tree, or Kerandee, by the natives there. The leaves are 
similar to the bay leaves, and have the same flavor as the tree. The 
Cinnamon is the second peeling of the tree and is thin and smooth. 
It is of a yellowish red color, and has an agreeable, sweet and 
piquant flavor. It is largely used by pastry cooks and confection- 
ers and for various culinary purposes, both in sticks and ground. 
Cinnamon is also cultivated in Tonquin, but only in the King's 
domain. Cinnamon flavor mixes, and tastes better, with prepara- 
tions made with milk than any other flavor.

COCOA. 

Coco ou Cocoa, Cacao. 

No. 515. — Cocoa is the fruit of the Cocoa tree, which grows in 
abundance in South America. The tree is about the size of a 
chestnut tree, and produces ribbed pods, which contain from 25 to 
50 seeds, which resemble ground almonds, and are covered with a 
dry pelicule. They have a bitter taste. There are several different 
varieties, namely, those of Caracas, of Ceylon, of Berbiche, of Saint 
Madelaine, and of Saint Domingo islands. They all differ in size 
and flavor. The best are those from Caracas, being lightly flattened 
and resembling our broad beans. The next best are those from 
St. Madelaine and Berbiche. It is less flattened than the Caracas 
variety, and its pelicule is covered with a fine, ash-colored powder. 
The other varieties are much more bitter and oily, and are mostly

used to make the Cocoa Butter. The germ of the Cocoa is always 
at the thick end, while in our almonds it is at the small end. The 
Cocoa of Caracas, St. Madelaine and Berbiche, mixed in equal 
quantities, makes the best quality of chocolate. This mixture gives 
an unctuous, oleaginous matter which chocolate should always 
possess. If chocolate is made simply from the Caracas Cocoa it 
will be too dry, while that made from the others alone would be too 
oily and bitter. Hence, the combination mentioned is necessary. 
After the Caracas beans are picked they are buried in the ground 
for four or six weeks, which causes them to lose some of. their 
bitter taste. Care must be taken or they will have an exceedingly 
moisty flavor. The Caracas Cocoa, mixed with the others, always 
makes the best chocolate. 

The cocoa, broma and chocolate we drink are made from Cocoa. 
When made into chocolate, it is ground into a paste and mixed with 
sugar, etc. There are several grades, some for eating, some for 
candies and creams, and some for beverages. Cocoa and broma are 
more healthful as a breakfast beverage than chocolate, as the latter 
is too rich. 

GROUND COCOA. 

No. 516. — Dilute two table-spoonfuls of ground Cocoa, with two 
spoonfuls of water. Then put it in a small saucepan and moisten it 
with three cupfuls of boiling milk or water. Stir it well and let it 
boil five minutes. Then sweeten it to taste. 

SHELL COCOA. 

No. 517. — Put two ounces of half-broken Cocoa in a saucepan 
with one quart of boiling water. Let it boil slowly for half an 
hour, or until half of the moisture is reduced. Add a little milk if 
desired and sweeten to taste. This is preferred by people whose 
stomachs are dedicate. 

BROMA. 

No. 518. — ^This is made the same as Cocoa. 

CHOCA. 

No. 519. — Take a cup of chocolate, a cup^of coffee and a cup of 
cream, and mix them well together. This makes a delicious bev- 
erage.

watejr, stirtring it until it is melted. Then add two cupfuls of hot 
boiled milk. Sweeten. to taste. As soon as it commences to boil, 
take it off of the fire and serve. 

POT CHOCOLATE. 

No. 521, — ^The best Chocolate is made in a pot expressly made 
for this purpose, in which there is a silver whisk. Put four cup- 
fuls of milk or water in a chocolate pot. (Or put one ounce of 
Chocolate to one cup of milk.) When the milk boils add the fine 
grated Chocolate. When the Chocolate is melted and well mixed, 
set it on the side of the fire for ten minutes to keep warm. Then 
take the whisk between the palms of both hands and make it revolve 
backwards and forwards briskly until the Chocolate is whipped to a 
froth. Then serve. 

CHOCOLATE, WITH EGOS OR CREAM. 

No. 522. — Grate four ounces of Chocolate, and put it in a saucepan 
with four soup-spoonfuls of boiling water, and stir it until it is 
melted. While stirring it, add in slowly five cupfuls of boiling 
milk. Let it boil up once, then sweeten it to taste, and set it on 
the side of the fire to keep warm. Have ready the whites of four 
eggs, whipped to a stiff froth. Add half of this quantity to the 
Chocolate, mixing it well. Sweeten the remaining half of the eggs 
with powdered sugar. Serve the Chocolate in cups, with a spoonful 
of the sweetened egg froth on top. 

Note.— ChocolAte can be made as aboTe, with cream Instead of eggs. Add the cream when the 
Chocolate Is ready to serve, having It whipped to a froth and flavored with vanilla. , 

Stir it well when you put it in, so the hot Chocolate will warm it, 
without letting it boil. 

Note.— Chocolate can be made with water or milk, or with both, mixed in equal quantities. This 
is merely a matter of taste, as some prefer it with water and others with milk or cream. When 
sweetened Chocolate is used, no sugar, or very little, should be added, as the delicate flavor is des> 
troyed when too sweet. Sweeten plain Chocolate to taste. Never keep Chocolate on the fire boiling. 

ADULTERATED CHOCOLATE. 

No. 523. — Chocolate^s often adulterated by unprincipled manu- 
facturers, which makes it a most vile compound instead of the 
nutritious beverage intended. They use small, common Cocoa, first 
extracting the Cocoa butter, and then mix with the remaining Cocoa 
a quantity of grilled sweet almonds. They also use the refuse of 
coarse brown sugar in place of pure sugar, and as a substitute for 
vanilla they use common storax, which is the sawdust of the Tonqua

tree; but persons experienced in flavor will detect the difference 
immediately. Impure Chocolate is also adulterated with butter, 
potato flour, starch, and other heterogeneous substances. 



Article LXIII. 



FrcneH COFFEE. Germu 

Cafe, Kaffet. 

No. 524. — Coffee is produced on a small bushy tree. The flowers 
are odorous, and the fruit jelly-like, having two seeds. Coffee is 
said to have originated in Arabia, but is now cultivated in different 
parts of the world. The Arabian historian, Ahmet Effendi, wrote 
that Coftee was first used in Arabia in the fifteenth century. The 
Egyptians prepare a drink with Coffee which the Arabs call Kawa. 
Coffee was introduced in France by the Venetians in 1657, after 
which its use became universal. There are five principal varieties 
of Coffee. The Mocha is considered the best, and is divided in 
three classes — namely, the Baouri, which is the best and is hardly 
ever obtainable in this country, as it is reserved for the highest 
classes in Arabia and Turkey; the Saki and the Salabi. The Coffee 
from Martinique, Java, Bio and Guadaloupe, is considered next best 
in quality. The grades from Santa Domingo, Costa Rica, and all 
other kinds, are of inferior qu dity. Coffee is now in use all over 
the civilized world, and is largely adulterated with the chiccory 
root, esl)ecially when ground. For this reason Coffee should always 
be procured in beans and ground when required. It will keep its 
flavor better in this wa^. Adulterated Coffee was first used in 1808, 
during the campaign of- Napoleon. The dealers, seeing the large 
profit, that could be made by combinihg chiccory with Coffee, 
adopted it, and even claimed that chiccory improved Coffee, which 
is not so. Most of the ground Coffee now prepared and sold by 
unscrupulous dealers is adulterated with chiccory, ground peas and 
common Coffee beans. Coffee beans are roasted in Coffee roasters 
that can be purchased from dealers. It is better to buy Coffee 
beans in their green state as their quality can then be better distin- 
guished than when roasted. The iaterior of the Coffee roaster is 
round, and the beans when being turned in the receptacle will roll 
over and over, and thus get evenly roasted on the surface of the hot 
roller. Commence to roast the Coffee over a slow fire, so it will be 
gradually and thoroughly browned, which will take place in about

THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE. 117 

forty-five minutes. When il; is browned take it out of the roaster 
and spread it on a blanket. It will then emit an agreeable odor. 
Turn it occasionally to cool it, and when cold put it in jars corked 
tight and grind it when needed. The Mocha Coffee has the best 
flavor, and is generally mixed with Java or Rio. This makes the 
best black Coffee. The Coffee from Martinique and Costa Rica, 
when mixed, is the best to use when milk is added. Coffee when 
ground is made by infusion. French and American coffee pots are 
so well known that no description of them is necessary. Either can 
be used. Coffee should always be made fresh, and care should be 
taken to have the water to the boiling point before it is poured over 
the (/offee. Coffee should not remain long in tin pots, as it 
contains an ingredient that combines with tin or iron, and imparts a 
disagreeable flavor when it lays for any length of time. For this 
reason when large quantities are made at a time it should be kept in 
earthen jars. When Coffee is left over, after a meal, always put it 
in an earthen jar to use the following day. 

Coffee is now made as it was years ago. The Orientals do not 
strain it. They boil it with the sugar in and serve it in cups, sus- 
pended below a punctured shell, called fitzyanes. Coffee made and 
served in this manner does not excite the nerves as when made in the 
French or American styles, but the latter modes are considered the 
best. When using a French coffee pot the boiling water has to 
drain through the ground Coffee and runs cleir immediately. 
Hence it is unnecessary to clarify it. When it is boiled in a sauce- 
pan and clarified with eggs or other substances, it loses much of its 
strength and flavor. Some physicians advance the theory that 
Coffee is injurious to health, but this is a fallacy, when it is used in 
moderation. A certain gourmet of advanced years, yet in robust 
health, was in the habit of imbibing a cup of Coffee after every 
meal. One evening while at dinner in the Palace Hotel with his 
friend, a well-known physician, the latter remarked casually that 
Coffee was a slow poison, and urged the gourmet to discontinue its 
use. 

'*Well," remarked the gourmet, with a sly twinkle in his eye, 
** I agree with you on that point, but I must say that it is terrible 
slow, for I have been using it continuously for the past seventy 
years, and am still alive and well." The doctor then subsided. 

REMARKS ON MIXING COFFEE. 

No. 525. — Coffee is easy to make, but must be made with care. 
The principal point is not to have your Coffee beans ground or 
roasted too long before using, and to always use good Coffee. To 
one pound of Mocha add two pounds of Java, or use one pound

118 HARDER'S AMERICAN COOKERY. 

of Mocha, one pound of Java, and one pound of Costa Eica or Rio. 
These mixtures make the best Coffee. Coffee is made best in the 
so-called French coffee pots, which are made for large or small 
quantities. When boiling Coffee, the aroma- evaporates to a con- 
siderable extent, which does not occur in French coffee pots. 
Oround Coffee should never be boiled when it can be done other- 
wise. Always use boiled milk or warm cream with Coffee, as cold 
milk injures the taste of the Coffee. Black Coffee, or cafe noir, 
is always taken after dinner, and should be made stronger than 
breakfast Coffee.' It is served with brandy, kirschwasser or rum, 
which is put in the Coffee, or first burnt with sugar, as may be 
desired. It is called brulo. It facilitates digestion and excites the 
faculties of the mind. 



COFFEE FOR FAMILY USE. 

No. 526. — ^To make ordinar}^ breakfast Coffee, use four ounces of 
ground Coffee to one quart of boiling water. When using the French 
coffee pot, put the Coffee in the upper vessel with the strainer over 
it. Pour a little of the boiling water over it slowly, and in five 
minutes pour over the rest of the water until it is all in the bottom. 
Keep the pot in a warm place, not letting the Coffee boil. Take 
about three cupf uls of the Coffee out of the bottom and strain it 
through the top again. Repeat this once more, as it makes the 
Coffee stronger, and then it will be ready for use. 

When making Black Coffee for after dinner, use more Coffee or 
less water to make it strong. 

BOILED COFFEE, No. 1. 

No. 527. — When no French coffee pot is used, the Coffee must be 
boiled in a saucepan and strained through a double thickness of 
flannel. When making Coffee in large quantities in a saucepan, put 
five pounds of ground Coffee in a saucepan, two fresh raw eggs, and 
a cupful of cold water. Mix it all well together with a wooden 
spoon, and then pour in, slowly at first, five gallons of boiling 
water, stirring it at the same time. Then set it on a brisk fire, and 
as the Coffee rises to the top press it down with a spoon. Let it 
boil up once, and then set it on the side of the fire to keep warm, 
not letting it boil. Drop half a cupful of cold water over the top, 
in drops, and the Coffee will settle immediately. Do this, if in a 
hurry, otherwise it will settle naturally in five or ten minutes. 
Strain it all through a double thickness of flannel, and it is ready 
for use.

BOILED COFFEE, No. 2. 

No. 528. — When using a boiler (in which there is a faucet three 
inches from the bottom, with a fine strainer inside ), and the Coifee 
is made as in No. 1, it need not be strained through flannel. Set 
it on the side of the fire to keep the Coffee warm, and put a piece 
of iron under the boiler to keep it a distance away from the tire. 
Then sprinkle half a cupful of cold water over the top, put the 
<;over on tight, and in ten minutes run the Coffee out until it runs 
clear. Then you will pour it back in the boiler. After this it will 
all run perfectly clear if not allowed to boil.

No. 530. — Mix half a pound of Mocha and half a pound of Java, 
and pour over it a pint of boiling water. Cover the saucepan tight 
and let it stand in a warm place for tea minutes. Then strain it 
through a French coffee pot, pouring it through the strainer twice 
again. When cold put the Coffee in bottles, and use it as needed. 

COFFEE ICE. 

No. 531. — Take a small cup of Coffee and put it in a tumbler with 
the same quantity of water and a lump of ice. Sweeten it a 
little. This makes a delightful, refreshing summer beverage, which 
will be greatly appreciated at a light luncheon.

''spinach. The Com Salad that grows natural is better than that 

which is cultivated. It is used in salads, and when mixed with 

beets and celery it improves it as a breakfast salad. 

CULTURE. 

No. 538. — Sow the seed during August or September, in shallow 
drills about one foot apart. If the soil is dry it should be pressed 
firmly over the seed in order to secure prompt germination. Cover 
them with straw upon the approach of severely cold weather. The 
plants will also do well if grown in spring, and, like most salad 
plants, are greatly improved if grown in very rich soil. The 
ground can scarcely be made too rich for them. In warm weather 
the plants will mature in from four to six weeks. 



CORN SALAD.

TmucA CORN. 

A£ai8. Maie, or Korn. 

No. 542. — ^The garJen variety of Corn for tible use, is distinct 
from the field Corn variety. It is much relished in this 
country, especially so when used in its fresh state. When dried, it 
is cracked and ground into hominy, of which there are several 
kind-', which are much used for breakfast, either boiled or fried. 
It is ground into meal (white and yellow), which is used for 
making bread and cakes. It is delicious when used as a mush with 
milk or cream. Corn starch is made from Corn, and is much 
used for custards, cream and various other pastry preparations. 
It is also a healthy nourishment for invalids and infants, and may 
be used for all preparations for which arrow root is used. 

CULTURE. 

No. 543. — A rich, warm, alluvial soil is best, and before planting 
it should be as deeply and thoroughly worked as possible. Culti- 
vate it deeply and thoroughly as soon as the plants appear, and 
then every few days until it tassels. Thorough cultivation and 
warm rich soil are the key notes to success.

of a white color, sometimes tinged with red. They must be cooked 
quickly in boiling water, because the red cob will color the grain if 
it is allowed to simmer over a slow fire, or allowed to remain in the 
water after being cooked.

milk. Then add in, gently, the whites of the eggs (beaten to a stiff 
froth), and bake. 

CORN STARCH. 

No. 598. — Corn Starch is the fecula of Corn, and is used for all 
the purposes for which arrow root is used in cooking. It is aJso 
much preferable to arrow root for alimentary purposes. It is used 
in creams, custards, blanc mange, and a numberless variety of cakes 
and fritters. It is also delicious for thickening certain soups and 
sauces, instead of flour, as it keeps them clear and transparent. 
Though many preparations made with Corn Starch are not as succu- 
lent as when made in their original styles, especially will this be 
found to be the case with creams, blanc mange, etc. It often 
happens that when articles are made of Corn Starch which are too 
stiff, or which are not well cooked, they retain a starchy taste. It 
is very nutritious for infants and invalids, when boiled in milk or 
made into custards. The recipes will be found in their respective 
places in the Books on Soups, Sauces and Pastries.

root, and an erect, branching stem from two to three feet in height. 
The radical leaves, which are produced on long footstalks, are oval, 
serrated and of a grayish color. Th"se of the stalks are smaller 
than the radical ones but similar in form. The plant has a soft, 
agreeable odor, and is sometimes used as a pot herb for flavoring 
soups. The leaves are used in salads and also for flavoring ale or 
beer. 

CULTURE. 

No. 602. — Costmary may be cultivated in almost any soil. It is 
generally propagated by dividing the roots, which increase rapidly. 
It should be planted in spring or autumn. Set them two feet apart 
in each direction.

No. 603. — The Cranberry is a trailing shnib, which grows wild 
in swampy meadows and on the borders of inland lakes. It can be 
improved, however, by planting in any moist soil that is thoroughly 
manured with decayed manure. When cultivated in this way the 
berries will be larger and of better flavor, and the yield will be 
more abundant. The berries are round, of a reddish color, and 
have an aciduous flavor. There are several varieties. The bell- 
shaped is the largest, having a dark-red color. The cherry variety

<jomes both large and small, the large kind being preferred. The 
color is dark-red, and it is considered next in excellence to the 
bell-shaped. The oval or egg-shaped Cranberry comes large and 
small also. It is a good variety, but not as profitable as the others. 

CULTURE. 

No. 604. — Procure the plants with their natural earth and plant 
them early in spring, four feet apart, in moist sandy soil, well 
manured. 

CRANBERRY SAUCE. 

No. 605. — Pick one pound of Cranberries and wash them in cold 
water. Put them in a copper basin with a glassful of water and

Freiicli CRESS, OR PEPPER GRASS. German 

Cressiti. ^ Pillenfarn. 

No. 606. — Cress, or Pepper Grass, is a pungent salad, and is 
mostly used in mixing with other salads. Mixed with fine herbs it 
has a piquant, agreeable taste, and it should always be used when 
young and freshly plucked. It gives a most agree ible taste to all 
green salads. 

CULTURE. 

No. 607. — The seed should be sown in drills about eighteen inches 
apart on very rich ground, and the plants well cultivated. Keep off 
insects by dusting with Pyrethrum powder. It may be planted 
very early. Continue sowing every week, as it matures very 
rapidly and runs to seed. 

The fine curled Cress is very superior, and will bear cutting sev- 
eral times. The Perennial American resembles the water Cress, 
and may be cut several times. 

The Garden Broad Leaved has a mild flavor and is generally used 
in soups.

Freneli GARDEN CRESS. Sermaa 

Creason alenois des Jardina, Kreste, 

No. 608. — This is one of the best plants in cultivation for herbs, 
and can be easily raised in pots or boxes. It runs quickly into 
seed and withers as soon as plucked, so for this reason it is rarely 
found in the markets. It is an excellent ingredient for salads, hav- 
ing a mild, piquant taste. The leaves should never be chopped, 
but are plucked or served in bunches. The leaves when laid 
between buttered sandwiches and eaten with eggs, make a relish 
highly esteemed by epicures.

WATER CRESS. 

Cres&on de Fontaine. Brunnen- Krease, 

• No. 609. — The Water Cress is a hardy, perennial, aquatic plant, 
growing abundantly along the margins of running streams, ditches 
and ponds. It is very easily introduced by planting it along the 
margins of ponds and streams where it does not already grow, and 
will increase both by the spreading of the roots and seeding. 

It has a particularly pleasant, pungent taste, and is agreeable to 
nearly every one. It is also one of the most delicious small salads. 

CULTURE. 

No. 610. — The seeds should be sown and lightly covered in grav- 
elly, murky lands, along the border of small, rapid streams. They 
will need no subsequent culture, as in favorable conditions they 
increase very rapidly by self-sowing of seed and extension of roots. 
Good beds should be fenced in to keep animals from trampling on 
them, and should also be kept clear of wild herbs. 

ITS USE. 

No. 611. — It is eaten as a morning salad, and should only be used 
when fresh. It should be washed well in cold water and then 
drained. (Care must be taken not to bruise or press it.) Then

Frenc!! CUCUMBER. Cerman 

Cuncombre, Gurke. 

No. 612. — There are many varieties of Cucumbers. They are 
eaten raw and are also cooked in various ways. "When used in salads 
they should be sliced very fine and sprinkled with salt to drain them 
of the water, otherwise they are apt to cause indigestion. It is a 
vegetable that can be grown to perfection by any one who controls 
a few square yards of soil which is fully exposed to the sun — the 
fruit being so very much better when gathered from the vine than 
when procured in the market. Some varieties are used for cooking 
purposes and some for pickling^ and are then called pickles, or 
gherkins. 

CULTURE. 

No. 613. — The plants are tender, and planting should be delayed 
until settled warm weather or ample facilities are provided to pro- 
tect *them from frost and during cold storms. Form low, flat hills, 
six feet apart each way, of rich soil, by mixing in a quantity of 
thoroughly decomposed manure, stirring the soil to a depth of 
sixteen inches or more. Scatter one seed every inch along the rows/ 
and cover them one inch deep, pressing the soil over them. As 
soon as the plants are up they will be liable to attack by the striped 
cucumber beetle. These may be kept off by frequent dusting with 
air-slacked lime. Care should be taken not to use too much lime, 
for if too strong it will kill the vines. When the plants are well 
established, thin to three plants to each hill. In gathering, pick 
all the fruit before it begins to ripen, as the vines will cease setting 
fruit as soon as any seed commences to mature. In gathering for 
pickles cu|; the stem instead of pulling the fruit off, and be careful 
not to mar the fruit in any way, for if the skin is broken the pickles 
will not keep.

152 HARDER'S AMERICAN COOKERY, 

CULTURE. 

No. 671. — The seed germinates slowly and should be started in 
strong heat, for in this, as in all tropical plants, it is of import- 
ance to secure a rapid and continuous growth from the first, the 
plants never recovering from a check received when young. When 
the plants have formed two rough leaves, transplant them to four 
inches apart, keep the bed closed and very warm, shaded from the 
direct rays of the sun, and giving them an abundance of water until 
the ground is warm and all danger, not only from frost but from 
cold nights, is past. Then harden off the plants by gradual exposure 
to the sun and air, and decrease the supply of water. Then care- 
fully transplant them into warm, rich soil, setting the plants two 
and one-half feet apart. If needed shade the young plants and 
protect them from the potatoe bug, which is very fond of them, and 
if not prevented will soon destroy the young plants. 

EARLY LONG PURPLE. 

No. 672. — This is one of the earliest and most productive varie- 
ties. The fruit is long and of a dark, rich, purple color, of fine 
quality.

is highly esteemed in the Eastern market. 

IMPROVED LARGE PURPLE. 

No. 675. — This is the best in cultivation, being early, a sure 
crop, and of fine quality. The plants are large and vigorous, with 
light green leaves. The fruit is very large and oval-shaped, a deep 
purple in color, with an occasional dash of green about the st«m. 
The flesh is white, tender and superior in quality.

ELDERBERRIES. 

Orcune de Surreau, HoUunderbeere. 

No. 691. — The Elderberry tree is found in all parts of this 
country, the flowery buds and fruit being used. The flowery buds 
are used for diet drinks. Pick them in bunches in the morning, 
before the rising of the sun, put them in a wooden tub and cover it 
with a blanket. When the heat will have expanded them, pick oflF 
the flowers, spread them out on a table, and when perfectly dry,

Wrcnc.1 ELECAMPANE. Genua. 

A uhte . A lantwurzel. 

No. 693. — Is a hardy, herbaceous, perennial plant, growing spon- 
taneously in moist places and in the vicinity of gardens where it 
has once been cultivated. The stem is from three to five feet high, 
thick and strong, branching towards the top. The leaves are from 
nine inches to one foot in length, oval-toothed on the margin, and 
downy below. The flower resembles a small sunflower, and is 
general propagated by dividing the roots, but may be grown from 
seeds, which are sown just after ripening. Elecampane is cultivated 
for its roots, which are carminative, sudorific, tonic, and alleviating 
in pulmonary diseases. They are in perfection when of two years' 
gi-owth. 



Article LXXXVI I, 



ENDIVE, OR CHICOREE. 

Chicorev ou Scarole. Endive^ or Cichorie. 

No. 694. — The Endive, in its natural state, is very bitter, but when 
properly blanched its leaves make a fine salad, and coming as it 
does, after the Lettuce, it is very useful for autumn and winter 
salad. There are two special kinds, of which there are ten 
different varieties. The Wild Chicoree, known as the Dandelion, 
is mostly eaten in salad when young and tender. The cultivated 
Endive (broad leaf) is used as a vegetable, and is prepared the 
same as spinach. 

CULTURE. 

No. 695. — It may be grown at any season of the year, but is 
generally used late in the fall. Sow the seed during June or July, 
in drills fourteen inches apart, and when well up thin the plants to 
one foot apart. When nearly full grown tie the outer leaves 
together over the centre, in order to blanch the heart of the plant. 
They will usually be fit for the table in ten days, and will continue 
in condition for use for about one week, so that the tieing up should 
be done every few days, in order to secure a succession.

it is cooked in milk and sweetened it makes an agreeable diet for 
invalids. It also makes a nice gruel when made with milk, water or 
broth.

FARINA (polenta) OP CORN MEAL, PIEMONTAISE. 

No. 710. — Put three quarts of water in a saucepan, and when it 
boils add a little salt and a piece of butter. Then drop in slowly 
two pounds of corn meal Farina, while stirring it. When it 
commences to thicken set it on the side of the fire to cook slowly 
for twenty-five minutes, stirring it up from the bottom occasionally. 
When it is cooked take it off of the fire and add six ounces of 
butter and six ounces of grated Parmesan cheese, mixing it all well 
together. Then put it in Charlotte moulds, that are buttered with 
clarified butter, and keep them warfti until ready for use, when you 
will turn them out and sprinkle grated Parmesan cheese over them. 
Serve them with a reduced beef gravy, in which put some essence 
of mushrooms. 

Note.— Broth may be used instead of water. If cooked this way serve a tureen of game con^o-nme 
with them. 

FARINA (polenta) OP CORN MEAL ON SKIVERS. 

No. 711. — Cook the Farina the same as in No. 710, but keep it 
firmer. When cooked take it off of the fire and add a piece of batter 
and some grated Parmesan cheese. Then pour it in a buttered 
pan, having it about one-quarter of an inch thick, put a buttered 
paper cover over it, and set it on ice to get cold. Out out as many 
pieces as possible, the size of a twenty-five cent piece, with a round 
cutter. Then cut some Swiss cheese in thin slices, and with the 
same cutter cut out the same number of pieces as you have of the 
Farina. Take a four inch wooden skiver and place on it a ring of 
the Farina, and then a ring of cheese, alternating in this way until 
three inches are covered. Then roll them in fresh bread crumbs, 
dip them in beaten eggs and then bread them again. Mould them 
neatly and fry them in hot lard. When nicely browned drain them 
and replace the wooden skiver with a silver one. Serve them on a 
napkin.

in hot lard, and when nicely browned, drain them. After this, 
take off the small cover and scoop out the center, (taking care not 
to break the shell), and fill them with the following preparation: 

Put the yolks of five raw eggs in a saucepan, add a pinch of nut- 
meg, and dilute it all with half a pint of cream. Add to it one pound 
of grated Parmesan cheese. Set it on a moderate fire and stir it 
until the cheese is melted. (Do not let it boil.) It should hare the 
consistency of a sauce. 

When filled, serve them hot. 

FARINA CRUSTS OR STANDS, OF CORN MEAL, FOR HOT OR COLD SIDE DISHES. 

No. 713. — These crusts or stands are made either with bread, 
rice or Farina. Those made with Farina are better than those with 
rice, for hot dishes, as they are not so heavy, and are better than 
those made with bread, as the Farina does not absorb the moisture 
as quick as the bread when they lay for any length of time. Cook 
the Farina in water, lightly salted, keeping it firm. When it is 
cooked put it in a buttered mould as near the size of the crust as 
possible, that you intend making. Smooth the surface, cover it 
with a buttered paper, cover and put on this a wooden cover with a 
weight on top to pr^ss the Farina down solid in the mould. Lay it 
aside to get cold and hard. Then take it out of the mould, and with 
a small sharp knife cut it into any shape desired. Dip it in beaten 
eggs and then in fresh bread crumbs or raspings of bread, and fry it 
in hot lard until nicely browned. Then drain it and keep it for use. 

FARINA TARTLETS OF CORN MEAL.

ter some small Tartlet moulds with clarified butter and set them in a 
cool place to let the butter get cold. Put the Farina into the 
moulds with a table knife, leaving a space in the center for filling. 
Fill the center with grated Parmesan cheese and smooth off the 
top. Then set them in a cool place, and when they are cold take 
them out of the moulds. Bread them in a mixture of half bread 
crumbs and half grated Parmesan cheese. Then dip them in beaten 
eggs and bread them again with the same mixture. Shape them 
w§ll, then fry them in hot lard until nicely browned. Then drain 
them, dish them up on a napkin and serve them hot. 

FARINA QL^NELLES, OR BALLS, OF CORN MEAL. 

No. 715. — These are made nearly the same as Tartlets, except 
that Gruyere cheese is used instead of Parmesan cheese. When

they are cold dip them in beaten eggs and fry them in hot lard. 
They may be used as a garniture or served the same as Tartlets. 

FRIED FARINA (POLENTA) OF CORN MEAL, RAMEQUIN. 

No. 716. — Cook one pound of Farina as in No. 710. When it is 
cooked take it off of the fire, add three ounces of butter divided 
into small pieces, and four ounces cf grated Parmesan cheese. 
Season it with salt, pepper, nutmeg and a pinch of sugar, and mix it 
well together. Moisten the pan slightly with cold water and drop a 
soup-spoonful of the Polenta into it so it will spread out a little, and 
continue doing this until the bottom of the pan is well covered, 
keeping each cake separate. Put some grated Parmesan cheese in 
the center of each, or a small piece of Gruyere cheese. Now cover 
each piece with a thin layer of the Polenta and set the pan aside, so 
the cakes will get cold. With a cutter about the size of a dollar 
cut out the cakes to a round shape. Take them out of the pan, dip 
them in beaten eggs and then in bread crumbs. Put a little clarified 
butter in a frying pan, and when it is warm add the Ramequin (not 
putting too many in the pan at a time), and fry them on both sides 
to a nice brown. Serve them on a napkin with fried parsley as a 
garniture. 

FARINA (polenta) FOR GARNITURES. 

No. 717. — When the Polenta is cooked as in No. 710, put it in 
small round buttered Charlotte moulds and keep them warm. Then 
turn them out and use them for large garnitures. They are espe- 
cially appropriate for Italian dinners. Those prepared as in Nos. 
713, 714, 715 and 716 can also be used as garnitures. 

FARINA GRUEL. 

No. 718. — Boil one pint of water, milk or broth, and when boil- 
ing drop in it four soup-spoonfuls of Farina, stirring it well. Let 
it cook slowly for twenty-five minutes. Sweeten or season to taste.

milk, broth or water. About two spoonfuls is sufficient for a pint 
of liquid. Stir it well when putting it in. Let it jcook for about 
twenty minutes, and then season or sweeten it as may be desired. 



Article xc. 



Fnnch SWEET FENNEL. Germain 

Fe7iouiL FeHchel, 

No. 720. — Sweet Fennel is a hardy, perennial, aromatic plant, of 
which there are several varieties. The common, or bitter fennel, 
has strong, deep, fleshy roots, and the seeds have a brownish color 
and a bitter taste similar to the leaves. Sweet Fennel seeds are 
used by confectioners and distillers, and the leaves are used for 
flavoring soups and sauces. The seeds resemble anise seeds. 

CULTURE. 

No. 721. — Fennel is cultivated the same as anise. Italian Fennel 
is quite distinct from the common variety, and is cultivated 
annually. The flowers are produced in umbels, as in the other 
species. The seeds are yellowish in color, slender, slightly curved, 
and have a pleasant anise like taste. When the stems have attained 
a sufficient size, they should be earthed up, the same as celery, to 
blanch. If properly treated the stems will be white, crisp and 
tender in about three weeks. When blanched they lose their bitter 
taste and are excellent for salads, possessing a sweet, pleasant, 
aromatic taste, and may be served the same way as plain celery for 
a relish.

Essence . Extrakt . 

No. 723. — Flavors, essences and extracts, are used by confec- 
tioners and pastry cooks, and for various culinary purposes, to 
impart an agreeable aroma, and are purchased in liquid form. The 
best quality should always be procured. Aromatic herbs and plants 
are used in making coffee, tea, wine, juleps, and many other drinks. 
The concentrated essence of meat, game, fish, or vegetables, when 
added to sauces and other culin&ry preparations gives a splendid 
flavor and is greatly relished. 

ESSENCE OF VEGETABLES. 

No. 724. — Put in a saucepan four pounds of rump of beef, a 
shin of veal cut in pieces, one hen, ten carrots, eight onions, five 
turnips, two heads of lettuce, two heads of celery, a faggot of 
chervil, and half a dozen cloves. Pour one gallon of broth 
over this and let it boil. Skim it well and let it cook slowly until

grain, and has many grades and varieties. It is much used for 
alimentary purposes, and the best should always be procured. The 
flour used in making bread is of a diflerent quality than that of 
which pastry is made. Flour when dried in the oven and lightly 
colored or cooked with butter to a light brown, gives a better flavor 
to sauces. It also makes a healthful soup and is more digestible 
than when used raw.

GARLIC. 

Ail. Knoblauch. 

No. 728, — Garlic is a bulbous rooted plant, having a strong, pen- 
etrating odor. The bulb is composed of many smaller bulbs called 
cloves. It is not popular with Americans, although used consid- 
erably in Europe and in the Southern States. It should be 
used with moderation, as the breath of persons who eat Garlic is 
very offensive. It is used in many preparations, but can be omitted 
and replaced by using shallots or onions, when desired. Garlic, 
when used in salad, should be rubbed on a crust of bread (called 
chapon). When used for stews, etc., and left whole, its flavor will 
not be strong and penetrating as when mashed or chopped, and 
gives the preparation an appetizing and agreeable taste, especially 
in mutton stews. 

CULTURE. 

No. 729. — Prepare the ground the same as for onions. Plant the 
bulbs in drills eight inches apart, and four inches apart in rows^ 
and cover them two inches deep. When the leaves turn yellow, 
take up the bulbs and dry them as you would do with onions. 

GARLIC BUTTER OR GASCONY BUTTER. 

No. 730. — Boil one dozen cloves of Garlic for ten minutes. Then

are gathered and cleansed they are scalded in boiling water, to 
prevent germination, and are then rapidly dried. This is the ordinary 
black ginger, most of which comes from Calcutta, and is called East 
India Ginger. In Jamaica another variety is prepared by selecting 
the best roots, depriving them of their epidermis and drying them 
carefully in the sun. This is the highly valued white Ginger, 
generally called Jamaica Ginger. A preserve is made from Ginger 
by selecting the young roots, depriving them of their cortical 
•covering and boiling them in syrup. This is imported from the 
East and West Indies, and from China. When good it is translucent 
and tender. The odor of Ginger is aromatic and penetrating, the 
taste spicy, pungent, hot, and biting. These properties gradually 
4iminish and are ultimately lost by exposure. It is used b}- pastry 
•cooks, and confectioners, in putting up spiced preserves and fruits. 
Pieces of Ginger that are light and friable, worm-eaten or very 
fibrous, should be rejected. Ginger is often adulterated with rice- 
starch, flour-ginger, brick dust, chalk, capsicum, and mustard. 
Ginger is a grateful stimulant and carminative, and is often given 
in dyspepsia, flatulent colic, and the feeble state of the alimentary 
canal attendant upon atonic gout.

flowers are produced on separate plants, the former being very 
numerous, and panipulated. The fertile flowers are generally 
-cemented together, or form a collection of small scales which are 
more or less covered with a fine yellow powder called Lupalin. 
The plant is principally cultivated for its flowers, which are largely 
used by manufacturers of malt liquors. The young shoots are cut 
in the spring, and used for culinary purposes, when they are five 
or six inches high. They are eaten as a salad, or are prepared the 
same as asparagus, which they somewhat resemble in taste. They 
are recommended by physicians for persons having nervous debility- 

BOILED HOPS WITH SAUCE. 

No. 750. — Cook the stems the same as asparagus, and serve them

HORSE-RADISH. 

Raifort. Meerettiq, 

No. 755. — Horse-radish is a plant having a root of a pungent 
taste, which when grated is much used as a condiment. There are 
two varieties, the wild and the cultivated. The latter kind is the 
best, attaining a large brown colored root, the flesh of which is 
white. It has a burning spicy taste, and is used both raw and 
cooked. It is grated and served as a relish, or in sauces, and is 
also very agreeable to eat with boiled beef. 

CULTURE. 

No. 756. — The best method of growing Horse-radish is from the 
little roots, four or five inches in length, and not from the crowns. 
The small roots will produce good radish fit for use in one season's 
growth. Plant a set with the small end down, where the slanting cut 
is, and so that the top will be two inches under the soil. It can remain 
in the ground until very late in the autumn, and can be bedded, or a 
portion can remain in the ground until spring. A dozen roots will 
furnish all that will be needed for family use for a life time, as it 
constantly increases, and the only danger is that it will spread too 
fast and become troublesome. It is best, therefore, to plant it in. 
some corner of the garden where it can grow without injuring other 
plants.

what quadrangular, and enclose one or two lens-like seeds, the size 
and color varying in different varieties. The Lentil is a vegetable 
of the greatest antiquity, and was much esteemed in olden times by 
those making long journeys. The seeds are used and prepared the 
same as beans, and for soups and purees, they are prepared the 
same as dried peas. 

CULTURE. 

No. 789. — Sow the seeds in May, in drills the same as green peas. 
They succeed best in dry, warm, light soil. 

COMMON LENTIL. 

No. 790. — This variety is considered superior to the large Lentil. 
The seeds are much smaller and are greatly esteemed. 

GREEN LENTIL, 

No. 791. — This somewhat resembles the small Lentil, the princi- 
pal distinction being in the color, which is green, spotted and 
marbled with black. 

LARGE LENTIL. 

No. 792. — The seed is white or cream colored. It is one of the 
most productive of all varieties, though inferior in quality. 

SMALL LENTIL. 

No. 793. — ^This is rather a late variety, of a close branching habit> 
being very prolific, and a variety much used by the French.

French LETTUCE. Cenut 

LaUue, LattichatdaU 

No. 800. — Lettuce is a hardy annual plant of Asiatic origin, and 
is always grown from seed. It may be had at all seasons of the 
year, but its quality is not always the same. There is no vegetable 
more generally used than Lettuce, yet few people know how appe- 
tizing it is when brought to the table fresh and in an unwilted con- 
dition. It ranks as one of the best green salads, and is much used 
with chicken and other salads. Lettuce is also used as a vegetable 
prepared the same as spinach, and when stuffed, and is used as a 
garniture for soups and meats. There are a number of varieties of 
Lettuce. 

CULTURE. 

No. 801. — The quality of Lettuce depends largely upon rapid and 
vigorous growth, and to secure that we need very rith, mellow soil, 
frequent surface cultivation, and an abundant supply of water. 
For the earliest crop sow the seed under glass, in March, and thin

out the plants to prevent crowding. If you intend to mature the 
plants under glass, keep the beds quite close, and water it frequently 
and abundantly with liquid manure, and keep it well shaded during 
sunny days. If the plants are to be sdt in the open ground, give 
them all the air possible, without freezing them, and harden them 
off by full exposure and the withdrawal of water before transplanting. 
The plants should be set out as soon as a warm spot can be made 
very rich and mellow. When they are set out, sow the seeds in 
drills, fourteen inches apart, and thin them out, as wanted for the 
table, until they stand eighteen inches apart. Hoe them frequently, 
and water them when dry. The Cos varieties should be tied up 
about ten days before using, in order to blanch the inner leaves. 

EARLY TENNIS BALL. 

No. 802. — ^This is the best variety of head Lettuce for growing 
under glass, being very hardy and having thick, crisp, and tender 
leaves. It forms a compact head under glass, but when in the open 
air, unless planted very early, it is liable to be loose and open. 

BLACK SEEDED SIMPSON. 

No. 803. — The leaves of this variety are very large and form a 
compact mass, rather than a distinct head. They are of superior 
quality, being thin and tender, and of a light green color. Their 
color prevents any wilting of the plant being noticed, and as a 
consequence, it is a popular market variety. 

SIMPSON EARLY CURLED. 

No. 804. — This is one of the best early varieties for family use. 
All of the leaves tend to produce a large loose head. The leaves 
are dark green, beautifully crimped, and are tender and crisp. 

EARLY BOSTON CURLED. 

No. 805. — ^This variety has numerous large dark green leaves, 
that grow close together, the edges being deeply frilled, so that the 
whole plant forms around mass, closely resembling a bunch of moss. 

f 

EARLY PRIZE HEAD (FERRY'S). 

No. 806. — ^This is the best Lettuce known. It forms a mammoth 
hardy plant, of which even the outer leaves are crisp and tender,

remaining so throughout the season. It is slow to run up to seed. 
Its flavor is delicious, and it is much used in soups, etc. 

HANSON. 

No. 807. — ^This is a very fine heading variety, of large size, and 
stands the sun better than any other sort. The heads are large, 
solid, sweet, tender, and crisp throughout, and are devoid of any 
bitter taste. 

DEACON. 

No. 808. — ^This plant is small, having very thick and smooth dark 
green leaves, which are crisp and tender. 

EARLY CURLED SILESLA. 

No. 809. — An early variety of very strong growth, which does not 
form a head, but is the best kind for cutting and bunching when 
young. The leaves are large and wrinkled and of a light yellow 
color. It resembles the Cos varieties in quality. 

FRANKFORT HEAD. 

No. 810. — A dark green curled variety with close round heads, 
which when opened are finely blanched and very crisp. It remains 
in head a long time. 

LARGE DRUMHEAD. 

No. 811. — The head is remarkably large and compact, though 
somewhat flattened. It is crisp and tender and one of the finest 
summer varieties. Its color is pale green without and white in the 
center. 

PHILADELPHIA BUTTER. 

No. 812. — This is a very early variety, desirable for forcing and 
for early planting out of doors, but it does not stand the sun well. 
It is medium in size, having a compact head, the leaves being 
smooth and thick and of a bluish-green color. 

BROWN DUTCH. 

No. 813. — ^This is an old and hardy variety, and always forms a 
large, solid head, which is somewhat coarse looking. The leaves 
are large and thick, of a deep green color outside, but beautifully 
blanched within. They are exceedingly sweet, tender, and of good 
flavor.

GREEN FRINGED. 

No. 814. — An ornamental variety of exceeding beauty, but 
inferior in quality. The inside of the leaves is white, the edges a 
light green, delicately fringed and crimped. Its handsome 
appearance makes it well worthy of cultivation for table decoration 
alone. 

WHITE PARIS COS. 

No, 815. — This is a large hardy variety, which takes long in 
running to seed, and is considered by many to be far better than 
the other varieties. The heads are long and upright, with oblong 
leaves, that are tender, brittle, and highly flavored. 

SALAMANDER. 

No. 816. — This is the best variety for summer use, forming large, 
compact heads. It is light ^reen in color outside, and white inside. 
Its great advantage is that it will stand drought and heat, and will 
remain longer in heads than the other varieties. 

LETTUCE BRAIZED, SPANISH STYLE. 

No. 817. — Select one dozen solid heads of Lettuce and trim off 
the outer leaves. Wash the Lettuce in plenty of cold water and 
then drain them. Parboil them for five minutes, then immerse 
them in cold water. After this press each head in the hand well, 
arrange them on a napkin and trim them. Next line a deep flat 
saucepan with thin slices of fat pork, on which you will put the 
heads of Lettuce side by side. Season with salt, pepper and nut- 
meg, and add a faggot of parsley garnished with two bay leaves, a 
sprig of thyme and two onions having three cloves stuck in each. 
Cover each head of Lettuce with slices of fat pork and moisten 
them with stock broth. Cover the saucepan and let this boil once 
and then set it on the side of the fire to cook slowly until done. 
Then drain them on a sieve and sponge off the grease with a nap- 
kin. Then put them in a saucepan with three spoonfuls of half 
glaze, and set them in the oven. When glazed serve them with a 
reduced Espagnole sauce. 

LETTUCE BRAIZED, GERMAN STYLE. 

No. 818. — Prepare the Lettuce as in No. 817, and when cooked 
drain them on a napkin and sponge off the grease. Then dish them 
up and pour over them some AUemande sauce, reduced with cream.

186 HARDER'S AMERICAN COOKERY. 

STUFFED LETTUCE. 

No. 819. — Prepare one dozen heads of Lettuce as in No. 817, and 
when parboiled immerse them in cold water, then press them in 
the hands and dry them. Put them on a towel on the table, spread 
out the leaves of each head and season with salt, pepper, and 
nutmeg. Add in the middle of each head some forced meat of veal 
(Godiveau) flavored with cooked fine herbs. Put the Lettuce in 
shape again, trim them and arrange them in a deep flat saucepan, 
lined with thin slices of fat pork. Moisten them with veal gravy, 
then let them boil, after which cover the saucepan and set it in the 
oven. Sprinkle them with the gravy occasionally, so they will glaze 
nicely. When cooked dish them up, strain off the gravy, take off 
the grease, and serve the gravy with them. 

LETTUCE STUFFED AND FRIED. 

No. 820. — Prepare the Lettuce the same as in No. 819, and when 
cooked drain them on a sieve, and sponge off the grease with a 
napkin. Then bread them and dip them in beaten eggs, and then 
bread them again in fresh bread crumbs. Fry them in hot lard and 
serve them on a napkin, with a garniture of fried parsley. 

LETTUCE WITH CREAM. 

No. 821. — Trim off the outer leaves of one dozen heads of Lettuce 
and wash the heads in cold water several times. Then put them 
in a saucepan, with boiling water lightly salted, and let them cook 
for ten minutes on a brisk fire. Then immerse them in cold water, 
drain them in a colander and press them dry in the hands. Then 
chop them fine. Put six ounces of butter in a saucepan, and when 
melted add two spoonfuls of flour, and let it cook to a light brown. 
Then add the Lettuce, stirring it in well, and season with salt, 
pepper, and nutmeg. Add in slowly a pint of cream and let it cook 
for ten minutes. Before serving, garnish it with hard boiled eggs, 
cut in quarters, and with toasted bread, cut in fancy shapes. 

LETTUCE, WITH GRAVY. 

No. 822. — Proceed the same as in No. 821, but in place of cream 
add some veal gravy or a good broth. Garnish with poached eggs 
or toast. 

LETTUCE FOR GARNITURE. 

No. 823. — When Lettuce is to be used for garnishing joints or 
large entries, use the braized or stutfed Lettuce as in Nos. 817, 



Digitized by 



Google 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE. 187 

818, 819 and 820. When it is used for garnishing small entrees 
and broiled meats, use Lettuce with cream or gravy, as in Nos. 821 
and 822. When it is used as a salad garniture select the inner 
leaves and steep them in cold water until ready for use. Keep the 
hearts to place on the top of the salad, or cut them in fine shreds 
and garnish around the dish, alternating with eggs. 

LETTUCE SALADS. 

No. 824. — ^Trim off the outer leaves of the Lettuce, wash the 
heads in cold water, trim the leaves, and then drain them on a 
salad strainer. Before using, drain them on a napkin, being 
careful not to press the leaves. Put them in a salad bowl and 
season with salt, pepper, sweet oil and vinegar. 

NoTB.— Dress the salad only when ready for use. Germans generally add some sliced young 
onions and a mustard dressing. This is made by masblng the yolk of a bard boiled egg in a salad 
bowl, diluting it with oil and vinegar, and adding mustard. Then mix it well together and season 
with salt and pepper. Pour this mixture over the Lettuco, and^mix it well with a wooden spoon and 
fork in a careful manner. Americans, especially in Mew England, dress the salad with sugar, vinegar, 
and cream. In the South they use oil, vinegar, salt, and pepper, or with a Mayonnaise dressing, and 
garnished with hard boiled eggs. The French add some line chopped chervil and tarragon, and 
occasionally a clove of garlic, chopped fine, or some garlic rubbed on a crust of bread (Chapon) . 
The Spaniards and Mexicans add some fine sliced green peppers, with sliced green onions. The 
English use a dressing made with the yolks of hard boiled eggs, diluted with oil, vinegar, and the 
^lice of onions or shallots, and seasoned with salt and pepper. For a family dinner dish up the 
salad plain, with hard boiled eggs sepaiately, or as a garniture. It requires an expert to dress a salad 
well. When ready for the salad the hostess should dress it, or if one of the company Is noted as a 
good salad dresser, she should request him to dress it. 

LETTUCE WITH CONSOMME (gARBURE). 

GRATINATED CBUSTS WITH LETTUCE. 

No. 825. — Trim one dozen heads of Lettuce, wash them well in 
cold water and then parboil them for ten minutes. Then immerse 
them in cold water and press them dry in the hands. Arrange the 
leaves nicely and tie them so they will keep their shape. Now 
prepare a deep, flat saucepan lined with thin slices of fat pork, 
some trimmings of veal, four sliced carrots and one sliced onion. 
Then put the Lettuce in and add a faggot of parsley garnished with 
one bay leaf and three cloves. Cover it all with thin slices of fat 
pork and moisten with enough broth to cover it. Set it on the fire 
to boil. Then cover the saucepan and set it on one side to cook 
slowly until tender. Then take them out carefully, place them on 
a clean board, take off the strings and cut them in two or three 
parts, lengthwise. Put in a deep baking dish some thin slices of 
toasted bread, then a layer of Lettuce, and continue this way until 
the dish is full. Season with salt and pepper. Then strain off the

gravy that they were cooked in, and pour it over the Lettuce and 
toast to cover it. Then set the dish in an oven to cook slowly 
until nicely browned. Before serving, take off the grease and 
43ervo with a soup tureen of consomme. 

LETTUCE WATER FOR INVALIDS. 

No. 826. — Wash and clean three heads of Lettuce, and soak 
them in one quart of boiling water for one hour. Then strain it 
through a napkin. Season with a little sugar, and take a cupful 
one hour before each meal for several days. It is recommended for 
those whose stomachs are deranged and also for those afflicted with 
nervousness. 

PRESERVED LETTUCE WHOLE. 

No 827. — Select three dozen fresh picked heads of Lettuce and 
trim off the outer leaves. Wash them well in cold water, and then 
parboil them for ten minutes in water lightly salted. Then immerse 
them in cold water and dry them on a napkin. Then arrange them 
in a flat saucepan and moisten them with enough broth to cover 
them. Let them cook until tender, and then drain them on a napkin. 
Out out the stalks, and then cut the heads of Lettuce in half, 
lengthwise, laying the tops over in the middle close together, so 
they will not curl outward. Then put them in square quart tin 
cans, the same way that you would arrange asparagus. Cover them 
with water lightly salted, solder on the covers and boil the tin cans 
in a hot water bath for two hours. 

PRESERVED LETTUCE, IN CANS. 

No. 828. — Prepare them as endives are prepared. See Article 
LXXXVII, No. 828. 

LETTUCE WHEN USED IN VEGETABLE SOUPS. 

No. 829. — Use the green tender leaves and wash them well to 
keep them green. Then cut them in shreds or with a cutter and 
put them in boiling water to cook for a few minutes. After this 
immerse them in cold water, then drain them and put them in 
soup when ready to serve.

Pr«neli LICORICE. German 

JieglisM, Siiahola-Barenzuker^ 

No. 830. — Licorice is a hardy perennial plant, the root of which 
abounds with a sweet juice, and is much used in demulcent compo- 
sitions. It has fleshy, creeping roots, which, when undisturbed, 
attain great length and penetrate deep into the earth. The roots- 
are the only part of the plant used, and are used by porter brewers 
and confectioners and for medicinal purposes. The sweet, mucilagi- 
nous juice, which is extracted from the roots by boiling, is much 
esteemed as an emollient for coughs and colds. 

CULTURE. 

No. 831. — It is propagated by planting slips of the roots, four or 
six inches long, that have two or three buds. Plant them in March ^ 
as soon as the ground can be worked, eighteen inches apart in rows 
that are three feet apart, covering them with three inches of earth. 
Every year late in autumn, when the sap has gone down and the 
leaves turned yellow, cut the old stem down with a pruning knife^ 
to a level with the ground. At this time the creeping stems are 
forked up and cut off close to the main stems. They are then 
preserved in sand for future planting. The roots will be ready for 
taking up three years after planting. This should be done towards 
winter, when the sap goes down in the roots. A trench three feet 
deep should then be dug around the roots, so they can be extracted 
without injury to them. They are then kept in sand until used.

LIMA BEANS. 

Feve Boht-e. 

No. 832. — The Lima Bean is one of the latest and most tender 
of garden beans. The stem is about ten feet high, and the leaves 
are smooth, shiny and narrow, yet comparatively long. The pods 
are about four inches long and an inch and a quarter broad, being 
flattened in shape, and containing from three to five beans. They 
are green and wrinkled when young, and of a yellowish color when

ripe. The pods are tough and parchment-like in all stages of their 
growth, and are never eaten. The Beans when either green or ripe, 
are universally esteemed for their peculiar flavor and excellence. 
If gathered when suitable for use in their green state, and dried in 
the pods, they can be preserved during the winter. When required 
for use, they should be shelled, then soaked for a short time in 
clear water, and cooked the same as green beans. When they are 
treated in this manner, they will be found to be nearly as tender and 
well flavored as when freshly plucked from the plants. The Lima 
Bean seldom perfects its crop in the Northern States, as only a 
small portion of the pods attain a good size, being destroyed by 
early frost. 

CULTURE. 

No. 833. — Commence planting when the weather is settled and 
the soil is warm and in good working condition. Procure a num- 
ber of poles six feet in length and set them out three feet apart 
each way. Plant five or six Beans in each hill, covering them with 
one inch of soil and being careful to set each Bean with its germ 
downward. After they have grown for awhile and before they 
begin to run, pull up the weakest and leave but three of the most 
vigorous plants in each hill. As they increase in height they should 
be tied to the poles with a soft, fibrous material. When they have 
ascended to the tops of the poles the ends should be pinched off. 
The ends of all branches that rise above that height should also be 
treated in the same way. This prevents them from running into 
vines and tends to make them blossom earlier and bear sooner and 
more abundantly. When cultivated near the Sieva, the varieties 
readily hybridize and the Lima Bean rapidly degenerates. Plants 
grown in the Southern States are healthy and vigorous and produce 
large Beans of excellent quality. 

GREEN LIMA BEANS. 

No. 834. — This is a sub-variety of the common Lima Bean, 
differing from it principally, in the pea-green color of the seed. It 
will remain longer on the plant without becoming hard, and is 
considered more tender than other kinds. 

MOTTLED LIMA BEANS. 

No. 835. — This is also a sub-variety of the common Lima Bean. 
The seeds are of a dull white, or greenish-white color, mottled or 
clouded with purple.

and is found in all warm climates. It has panicles of light yellow 
flowers and large cordate leaves. The flowering buds should be picked

No. 837. — Lovage is a hardy perennial plant having a hollow, 
branching stem six or seven feet high. It has smooth, deep green, 
glossy leaves, that somewhat resemble those of celery. The roots 
are large and fleshy, having a dark-brown color without and being 
yellowish within. Both the roots and seeds are used. The roots 
are sliced and dried and are used by confectioners in that state. 
They are also used in medicine as an aromatic stimulant. 

CULTURE. 

No. 838. — Lovage requires a deep, rich, moist soil, and should 
be sown in August, or immediately after ripening. When the 
young plants have grown three inches, transplant them three feet 
apart in each direction. When they are well established they will 
require but little care and will continue for years.

MARANTA, OR ARROW-ROOT PLANT. 

Arrow-root. Arroto-mehl. 

No. 843. — ^This is a genus of plants found in tropical America, 
and some species also in India. They have tuberous roots contain- 
ing a large amount of starch, and from one species arrow-root is 
obtained. The Indians are said to employ the roots of this species 
in extracting the poison of arrows, whence the name. The fecula 
obtained is called Arrow-Boot. The root of this plant is perennial, 
tuberous, fieshy, horizontal and scaly, and is a foot or more in 
length, having numerous long, white fibres. It sends forth several 
tuberous jointed, curved, white stoles, the points of which some- 
times rise above the ground and become new plants. Several 
stems proceed annually from the same root, being l^ranched and 
slender, and about four inches high. The Arrow-Boot plant is a 
native of the West Indies, where it is largely cultivated, and its 
cultivation is also carried on in the East Indies, Africa and the

Jamaica furnishing the next best quality. The plant is propagated 
early, by cutting off the roots. Arrow-Boot is adulterated with 
flour from other roots, such as the Curcuma and the Tacca Oceanica 
from the Sandwich Islands. Potato flour is also used. Arrow-

odor. It has a firm feeling when pressed between the fingers, and 
produces a faint crackling sound when rubbed. It is a pure starchy 
corresponding in its chemical properties with that of corn starch 
or potato starch. When purchased it should be free from any 
unpleasant flavor, as it is liable to get musty. Keep it in a dry 
place. 

PREPARTION OF ITS FLOUR. 

No. 844. — The flour is prepared in the following manner: The- 
roots are dug up when a year old, then washed and pounded into a 
pulp, which is thrown into water to separate the amylacteous from 
the fibrous portion. The fibres are removed with the hands, which 
leaves the starch suspended in the water, to which it gives a milky 
color. The milky fluid is strained through a coarse towel, and is 
allowed to stand that the flour may settle. The flour is then washed 
with fresh water and is dried afterwards in the sun. 

ITS USE. 

No. 846.— Arrow-Boot is nutritious and demulcent, and affords a 
light and easily digested article of diet for the sick and convalescent. 
It is peculiarly suited, from its demulcent properties, to tliose 
afflicted with complaints of the bowels and diseases of the urinary 
passages. If is much used as food, for infants after weaning or 
when the mother's milk is insufficient. It is prepared by dissolv- 
ing it in hot water with which it forms a pearly gelatinous solution, 
and if sufficiently thick it forms a jelly-like mass when cool. A 
tablespoonful will contribute sufficient consistence to a pint of water. 
It should first be made into h paste with a little cold water and the 
boiling water should then be added, with brisk agitation. The 
preparation may be rendered more palatable by adding lemon juice 
and sugar, or, in extreme sickness, by addinj]^ wine and spices. It 
is usually prepared with milk when taken by children.

MINT. 

Menthe. Garten Munze, 

No. 854. — Mint is a hardy perennial aromatic plant, producing, 
by distillation, a highly odoriferous and pungent essential oil. It 
is generally cultivated in gardens, but grows naturally near brooks 
and in rich, moist soil. It is used in making sauces for flavoring, 
for medicinal purposes, for flavoring drinks, and by confectioners. 
. The common or plain leaved variety is the best for general use. 
The Spear-Mint is inferior for culinary purposes, but is prettier 
for garnishing, on account of the curled foliage. 

CULTURE. 

No. 855. — It is propagated best by a division of the roots, which 
readily establish themselves wherever planted. In cultivating 
from seed, sow under glass and transplant them when the leaves 
are formed.

No. 858. — In its natural state the Morel is found growing in 
orchards, in damp woods, and in moist pastures. There are 
several varieties, all of which are edible. It is about four inches 
in height and is distinguished by its white cylindrical hol- 
low, and solid smooth stem. Its cap is spherical and hollow, 
and of a dark brown or gravy color. It adheres to the stem by its 
base, and is deeply pitted over the entire surface. It is in perfec- 
tion early in the season, but should not be gathered after a rain or 
while it is wet with dew. If gathered when dry it may be preserved 
many months. The Morel is much used in its dry or fresh state, to 
heighten the flavor of stews and gravies. Tbis mushroom is to be 
obtained from Italian warehouses and is the best variety in use in 
its dried state.

FKneH MULLEN, OR MULLEIN. GermaD 

Mol-nt ou Bouillon blanc. Wollkrout. 

No. 866. — Mullen is a field plant. Its leaves and flowers have 
been employed as remedial agents. They have a slight odor and 
a mucilaginous, bitterish, feeble taste. Mullen leaves are demul- 
<3ent and emollient, and are said to possess anodyne properties, 
which render them useful in pectoral complaints. A strained infu- 
sion of the flowers is used in mild catarrhs and in diarrhoea. It 
will be found advantageous to moisten the leaves previous to boil- 
ing them. Pick the flowers before they expand, dry them in the 
shade, mixing and turning them occasionally to have them perfectly 
dry. Keep them in boxes in a cool dry place, and use them in diet 
drinks (tisanes), as in Article LXXXII.

lar plant, having generally a more or less rounded thallus supported 
upon a stalk, and having seeds upon the under surface or gills. 
They are numerous, being found in all parts of the world, and are 
usually of very rapid growth, often springing up and coming to 
■ maturity in a single day. Many species are used for food in differ- 
ent parts of the world, while other species are poisonous. Many 
varieties abound in the pastures and woods in all the States, and 
may be gathered wild and enjoyed by those who have not the 
means of raising them artificially. They are gathered in all the 
different stages of their growth, and are used boiled, stewed, 
stuffed or broiled, and when dried are used for flavoring. The 
current belief is that, while many fungi are virulently poisonous, 
others, including the common Mushroom, are free from poison, 
and may be eaten in any quantity. The fear of poison deters many 
from making any use of this savory and nourishing but treacherous 
vegetable, and if they are afraid to eat them it is a matter of con- 
siderable importance to have the real standing of fungi as food 
stuffs made clear. According to recent investigations the question 
seems to be, not how to distinguish the poisonous from harmless 
species, but how to treat Mushrooms of every sort in such a way as 
to remove or neutralize the poison which they contain, with the pre- 
caution of using this class of food stuffs at all times with modera- 
tion. It has been ascertained that repeated washing with cold 
water removes most of the poison of Mushrooms, and that boiling 
dissolves out the rest. The water in which Mushrooms are boiled, 
however, is always poisonous, more so even than raw Mushrooms. 
Dried Mushrooms have been found to be dangerous for twenty 
days, and also the water in which such Mushrooms had been boiled. 
They are not really safe until after four months' drying. There- 
fore, treat all Mushrooms as poisonous; carefully throw out all the 
water in which they have been washed; cook them well, and never 
eat them in large quantities. The fact that all Mushrooms are more 
or less poisonous should be no bar to their use as food, proper care 
being taken in the cooking and eating. The detection of poisonous 
Mushrooms is a matter of deep consideration. The surest method 
of detecting them, and a precaution that should always be taken, is 
to put a silver coin or a solid silver spoon in the water in which 
Mushrooms are cooked. If the silver assumes a bluish or black 
color it may be assured that one or perhaps all of the Mushrooms 
are poisonous, and they should be thrown away. 

CULTURE.

would finally submit to and probably improve by cultivation, though

as yet but a single species has been generally introduced into the 
garden. The common Mushroom is-the only kind cultivated, and 
can be grown in cellars, sheds, on shelves in the open air, or in 
caves free from iron or coal. Beds of the required width and length 
are made of fermenting horse manure, at a temperature of about 
seventy degrees, being eighteen inches deep. Plant the broken 
pieces of spawn in this bed, six inches apart, covering the whole 
with two inches of light soil, and protecting it from cold or severe 
rains. The Mushrooms will appear in about six weeks. Irrigate 
only when the bed is quite dry, with soft or lukewarm water. The 
best of all situations, when available, in which to grow Mushrooms, 
are underground caves, such as supply the Paris markets with such 
vast quantities. 

THE COMMON MUSHBOOM. 

No. 869. — When the common Mushroom first appears it has a 
white color, is of a roundish button-like form, and apparently rests 
on the surface of the ground. When fully developed the stem is 
solid and two inches in height, and its cap measures from one to 
four inches in diameter, changing to a brownish color when old and 
becoming tough and fleshy. It is readily distinguished when of 
medium size, by its fine pink or fiesh-colored gills and pleasant 
odor. When old, the gills become of a chocolate color and it is 
then liable to be confounded with other kinds of a dubious quality. 
However, the species which resemble it most is slimy to the touch 
and is devoid of its fine odor, having rather a disagreeable smell. 
The noxious kinds always grow in woods or on the margin of woods, 
while the wholesome Mushroom springs up chiefly in open pastures, 
and should be gathered only in such places when young and tender. 
The Mushroom produces no real seed, but instead of it has a white 
fibrous substance in broken threads, called spawn, which is pre- 
. served in horse manure, being pressed in the shape of bricks. It 
will preserve its vitality for years when prepared in this manner. 

AGARICUS COMATUS MUSHROOM. 

No. 870. — ^This is an excellent variety that is found in abundance 
in stumps of trees in pastures, appearing in spring and autumn. It 
is much used in catsup, but should only be used when young. •* 

SWEET OR DELICIOUS MUSHROOM.

while the juice of the noxious kind is white and unchangeable. It 
is found in the fall of the year, 'growing under lir or pine tr-es. 

THE ST. GEORGE MUSHROOM. 

No. 872. — This is a variety that attains a weight of four or five 
pounds in California, but is not as delicate as the common Mush- 
room. Those grown in Europe are superior to the common Mush- 
room in flavor and are more digestible. It grows in rings in pas- 
tures or in thickets under trees, and reappears for successive years 
on the same spot. 

BLE wit's blue HATS. 

No. 873.— This is a favorite species, and is sold largely in the 
markets. It has a soft, moist, smooth pileus, with a solid bulbous 
stem, tinted with light blue. The gills are of a dingy white color, 
and rounded towards the stem. It should only be gathered in dry 
weather, as it absorbs moisture readily, and thereby is injured in 
flavor and rendered more liable to decay. 

AGARICUS PRIMULAS. 

No. 874. — This variety is found only in spring, and grows in rings 
on the borders of woodlands, at which time an abundance of its 
spawn can be obtained. It may be preserved by transplanting it 
into bricks of loam and horse manure, in which it will keep for 
several months, the same as the spawn of common Mushrooms. 
This variety is used both in its fresh and dried state. It is preserved 
by bein^ cut into quarters, and tlien dried in the air for several 
days, when it is strung up and kept for future use. 

THE FAIRY KING. 

No. 875. — This Mushroom is found growing in rings, and has a 
pileus of a brownish ochre color, which changes to a .paler cast as 
it grows, until it gradually fades into a rich, creamish yellow color. 
It is of excellent flavor, and is valuable for domestic use, owing to 
the facility with which it is dried, and its extensive dissemination. 
Jt may be kept for yeays without losing its aroma or flavor. 

MoTB.-The BoTetns, Clavarla, and Morel varieties of Miuhrooins will be found under their

having two quarts of acidulated water in each pan. Wash them 
well, then trim them and put them in separate pans again, that 
contain acidulated water. Let them soak for a while until ready 
to use them. The small, solid button Mushrooms will resemble the 
cultivated French Mushrooms when cooked, and may be used ior 
sauces and small garnitures. Cut off the stems of the hollow ones 
before washing them. The heads are used for stuffing, and are also 
broiled. The tops of the solid ones should be cut in crescent-like 
grooves, to give them a fancy appearance. The trimmings are 
chopped fine, and are used with fine herbs. 

COOKED MUSHROOMS, FOR GENERAL PURPOSES. 

No. 877. — When the Mushrooms are >yashed and cleaned as in 
No. 876, select a saucepan that is not too large for the quantity of 
Mushrooms to be cooked. Put two pounds of fresh Mushrooms in 
the saucepan and add four ounces of butter, a quarter of a glassful 
of cold water, and the juice of two lemons. Cover the saucepan, 
put it on a brisk fire, and when the Mushrooms have boiled for two 
or three minutes, pour them into an earthen jar. When they are 
cold cover them with a buttered paper cover and keep them in a 
cool place. They may be used for any kind of sauces or garnitures. 
The juice is added to sauces to reduce them. 

KoTB.— When cooking l^rge quantities of Mnshrooms, pat the snuoepan on the fire and odd 
them when the liquid boils. A wine-glassful of water will be suffloient for Ave poands of Mush- 
rooms.

MUSHROOMS FOR GARNITURE. 

No. 889. — Use the solid, round, button-like Mushrooms for 
garnishing. Leave them whole, or if quite large use only the head. 
Keep them white, and groove the heads in crescent shapes, as it 
gives them a finer appearance. Dress them in bands, alternating 
with other vegetable garnitures. Stuffed Mushrooms are used for 
large garnitures, the same as stuffed tomatoes or peppers.

which the varioas kinds intermix or hybridize, the varieties are not 
only numerou'i, but are constantly increasing. Familiar names of 
different varieties are changed annually, as new kinds with superior 
recommendations spring up, and are offered as welcome substitutes 
for the old kinds. 

CULTURE. 

No. 909. — Cultivate them as you would cucumbers, except that 
the hills should be six feet apart, but avoid planting them near 
xjucumbers, as they will mix with and injure the quality of the 
melons; this, and heavy rains at the time of ripening, will destroy 
the flavor of the finest stock. Bich earth for the young plants is 
far better than manure, but if the latter must be used, see that it is 
well rotted. If the plants grow very rank, more and finer fruit will 
be secured by pinching off the ends of the shoots when about three 
feet long. Cantaloupes are cultivated in the same manner. 

BEECH WOOD MELON. 

No. 910. — ^The melon is nearly spherical, but is somewhat longer 
than broad. The skin is of a greenish yellow color, thickly and 
regularly netted. The flesh is green, being sugary, and of excellent

flattened slightly at the ends, being deeply and thoroughly ribbed. 
The skin is green, and thickly netted, but when fully matured it 
becomes tinged with yellow. The flesh is thick, green, and juicy, 
having a rich sugary flavor. It is a hardy abundant bearer, uniform 
in quality, and is much used in the Southern States. 

HARDY RIDGE. 

No. 913. — A productive variety, having small fruit, which is 
strongly ribbed and has irregular warts all over its surface. The 
skin is of a dull yellow color. The flesh, is about an inch deep, of 
a bright orange-red color, and is sweet and well flavored.

No. 942. — The common Nettle is a hardy, herbaceous perennial, 
which grows naturally and in abundance by the wayside, but it is 
seldom seen where people have not been at work; hence it is consid- 
ered a sort oi domestic plant. The stem is erect and branching, while 
the leaves are heart-shaped at the base, toothed on the borders, and 
thickly set with small, stinging hair-like bristles. The common 
Nettle produces a large proportion of fiber, which is used in making 
ropes, cordage, sewing thread, and white linen cloth of sup<>rior 
quality. Like many other common plants the superior merit of 
these troublesome weeds has been greatly overlooked. Early in 
April the tops will furnish tender leaves that are used as a pot herb 
for soups, or are prepared the same as spinach. The cultivated

Numerous varieties are cultivated in Sumatra, Java, Penang, Ceylon, 
and other parts of the East Indies, and have been introduced into 
the Isles of France and Bourbon, Cayenne, and several of the West 
India islands. The Penang Nutmegs are distinguished by not being 
limed. When Nutmeg is cut or broken it presents a yellowish 
surface, varied with a reddish brown, branching, irregular veins, 
which give to it a marbled appearance. These dark veins abound 
in oily matter, upon which the medicinal properties depend. The 
odor of Nutmeg is delightfully fragrant, the taste warm, aromatic, 
and grateful. Its virtues are extracted by alcohol and ether. The 
largest Nutmegs are the most expensive. They should be rejected 
when very light, with a feeble taste and smell, worm eaten, musty, 
or marked with black veins. Nutmeg has considerable narcotic 
power, and when taken in doses of from two to three drams will 
produce stupor and delirium, and dangerous if not fatal conse- 
quences. It is frequently used as an agreeable addition to 
farinaceous articles of diet, and to various kinds of drink in cases 
of languid appetite and delicate stomach. It is usually given in 
substance, and is brought by grating to the state of a powder. Its 
pleasant flavor makes it invaluable in cookery for seasoning. Nut- 
meg should always be purchased entire, as when it is ground it soon, 
loses its strength. To ascertain if they are fresh stick a pin in one, 
and if the pin is oily when you withdraw it the Nutmeg is fresh. 
When dry they are of no use.

FreBeH OATS. 

Farine D'Avoine. Hafermehl, 

No. 946. — The common white Oat is specifically distinguished by 
its loose panicle, its two-seeded glumes, and its smooth seeds, one 
of which is awned. It is cultivated all over the world chiefly for 
horses, but the grain is very nourishing and is largely consumed as 
food in Great Britain and other countries. A decoction is said to 
possess decided diuretic properties, and to be useful in dropsy. 
The seeds deprived of their husks are sometimes called groats. As 
a food coarsely ground Oat meal is usually preferred to the fine meal. 
Oat meal is very slightly, but not unpleasantly, bitter, and yields 
most of its nutritive matter readily to boiling water. Gruel made 
from Oat meal affords a nutritious and easily digested aliment. It 
is generally administered after brisk cathartics to render them 
easier and more efficient in their action. 

BLACK CHAMPION. 

No. 947. — ^This new Oat possesses great merit. Its tillering 
properties are remarkable. The heads, or panicles, are long and 
very spreading, averaging sixty or seventy spikelets, from twelve to 
eighteen inches in length, with two large grains to each spinkelet. 
The kernels are extra large, plump and heavy, black and glossy; 
are without awns, while the husk is thin and soft. The straw is 
from three to six feet long, stiff and elastic, does not lodge, and so 
far seems to be rust-proof. Only half the quantity of seed should 
be sown, compared with other sorts. 

AMERICAN TRIUMPH. 

No. 948. — This variety has many excellent qualities. Its average 
height when standing in the field is six feet, yet the straw is so 
strong and firm that it holds up well, without lodging. The tall, 
luxuriant heads are filled with plump> heavy grains.

RUSSIAN WHITE OATS. 

No. 949. — This grain is very productive, a single grain giving 
sixteen stalks in many instances. It is generally free from rust, 
and is well adapted for general use. 

GRUEL. 

No. 950. — Gruel is prepared in different ways with oat meal flour, 
and with the grain. Use fresh flour only, as it is liable to have a 
sour taste, if not kept in a dry, warm place. When using flour the 
gruel is prepared with water, milk or broth, then sweetened with 
sugar or honey, and flavored with the juice of a lemon. When 
making gruel from the whole grains steep them in cold water over 
night, then drain them and let them cook slowly in water or milk, 
and when cooked strain the gruel through a towel with pressure, and 
sweeten to taste. 

OAT MEAL GRUEL. 

No. 951. — Oat meal gruel may be prepared by boiling an ounce 
of meal with three pints of water to a quart, straining the decoction, 
allowing it to stand until it cools, and then pouring ofl* the clear 
liquor from the sediment. Sugar and lemon juice may be added 
to improve its flavor; raisins are not unfrequently boiled with the 
meal and water for the same purpose. 

SCOTCH OAT MEAL GRUEL. 

No. 952. — Soak one pound of Oat meal over night, then strain the 
liquid through a towel, with pressure, to extract as much of the 
farinaceous matter as will go through. Put one quart of water 
in a saucepan, and when it boils add a little salt and the liquid 
extracted from the Oat meal. Let it boil down until it thickens, 
and serve it hot, or allow it io cool to a jelly-like mass, and serve 
it with cream and powdered sugar. 

OAT MEAL PORRIBGB. 

No. 953. — ^Boil two quarts of water in a sauce pan, season it with

FrcBeh OKRA, OR GUMBO. Cennan 

Onmbo, Ocher. 

No. 955. — Okra is an annual plant from the West Indies and 
Soath America, and is largely raised in the Southern States. It is 
cultivated for its green seed pods, which are used in soups and 
served as a vegetable. The pods when young and tender should be 
cut in sections, strung on twine and hung up in the shade to cure 
(the same way as dried fruit). In this condition the Okra can be 
used for soup at any time. 

CULTURE. 

No. 956. — Sow the seed thinly in dry, warm soil, in shallow drills 
two feet apart. Cover the seeds lightly, and after the plants are 
up thin them out to nine inches apart. Hoe frequently and draw 
a little earth to the stems as they continue to grow. Gather the 
pods when quite green and about an inch and a half long.

first year. The bulbs, for which the plant is generally cultivated, 
are biennial, and differ to a considerable extent in their size, form,

medicinal qualities. The disagreeable odor it imparts to the breatb 
may be avoided in a great measure by. thorough cooking, or by^ 
eating a few leaves of parsley. Much depends upon the climate 
and soil as well as the quality of seed, which exerts a great influence 
on the crop, and to this end great care should be exercised in 
selecting the seed. The white Onion is much sweeter than the red. 
Onions are used more than any other vegetable for culinary 
purposes. 

PREPARATION OF THE SOIL, 

No. 969. — A good crop of Onions can be raised in any soil which 
will produce a full crop of corn, unless it be* stiff clay, very light 
sand or gravel, or certain varieties of muck or swamp land. There 
is no crop in which the quality of the manure used is of greater 
importance than in this. If it is too rank it is quite sure to make 
soft Onions, with many scullions. It should be fermented during 
the previous summer to kill the wheat seeds. All refuse of the 
previous crop should be removed, the manure spread evenly, and 
the ground plowed a moderate depth, in order to thoroughly mix the 
manure with the soil. . Cultivate as early in the spring as the ground 
will permit. It is impossible to cultivate the crop economically 
unless the rows are perfectly straight, and to secure this, stretch a 
line along one side, fourteen feet from the edge, and make a distinct 
mark as a guide. Then having made a wooden marker something 
like a giant rake (with five teeth about a foot long, and fourteen 
inches apart), make four more marks by carefully drawing it with 
the outside tooth in the line and the head at right angles to the 
perfectly straight mark made by the line. Continue to work around 
this line until on the third passage of the marker you reach the 
side of the field where you began. Measure fifteen feet two inches 
from the last row, stretch the line again and mark around in the 
same way. This is much better than to stretch a line along one 
side. Sow the seed as soon as the ground is ready, which can be 
done best by a hand seed drill. 

CULTURE. 

No. 970. — ^As soon as the Onions are up so they can be seen the 
length of the rows, hoe them by just skimming the ground between 
the rows. A few days after give them the second hoeing. This 
time hoe close up to the plants. After this weeding must commence, 
which should be dona thoroughly and carefully, stirring the earth 
. around the plants in order to destroy any weeds that have just 
started and cannot be seen. In about two weeks they will require 
another hoeing and weeding, similar to the last, and two weeka

later another if necessary. If the work is carefully done the crop 
will need no further attention until ready to gather. Then, as soon 
as the tops die and fall, the crop should be gathered by pulling 
four rows and laying them in one row (the tops all one way), and 
then forming a similar row with the tops in the opposite direction. 
If the weather is fine they will require no attention, while curing, 
but if not they will need to be stirred, by .simply moving them 
slightly along the row. When the tops are perfectly dry cut them 
off half an inch from the bulb and throw each pair of rows together, 
forming windrows about nine feet apart. After a few days of bright 
weather they will be fit to store away. 

HOW TO KEEP ONIONS THROUGH THE WINTER, 

No. 971. — It is essential for the preservation of Onions to keep 
them dry, to have thorough ventilation, and to keep them free from 
frost. One of the most popular methods of keeping Onions is to 
spread straw to the depth of fifteen inches on a dry floor and upon 
this spread the Onions ten inches deep and cover them with one foot 
of straw. They will then keep in fine condition for months. Upon 
the approach of cold weather close the doors and windows, keeping 
the temperature just above the freezing point. With proper care 
they can be kept sound until spring. 

REMARKS ON SMALL ONIONS. 

No. 972. — It is difficult to grow Onions from seed in certain 
localities, while from sets good Onions are grown quite early. The 
sets are little Onions grown up the previous year and taken up when 
as large as peas. When set out in the spring they very soon form 
good large Onions. There are two kinds of Onions that are not 
grown from seed, the Potato and the Top Onion. The Potato 
Onion grows in clusters under the ground. These little bulbs are 
planted in the spring and produce large Onions. The large Onions 
are planted the next spring and produce the clusters. The Top 
Onion produces the small clusters on the top of the stem, where 
the seed is produced in the common varieties. These small Onions 
are planted in the spring and the result is full grown Onions; the 
large ones with a year's growth produce the clusters.

early in the season. 

GIANT ROCCA. 

No. 983. — ^This variety is well adapted for culinary purposes, 
having a mild flavor, tender flesh and a light brown skin. It pro- 
duces large globular Onions from seed the first season, but to attain 
its largest growth, the smallest bulbs should be set out the next 
spring, when they will continue increasing in size instead of pro- 
ducing seed. 

GIANT WHITE ETALIAN TRIPOLI. 

No. 984. — ^This is a large, beautiful, pure white flat variety, that 
will produce large Onions from seed, but to attain their largest size 
the small bulbs should be set out the following spring. The flavor 
is mild and excellent. 

NEW QUEEN. 

No. 985. — ^This variety grows quickly and keeps well. If sown 
in February, it will produce Onions two inches in diameter early 
in summer. If sown in July, they will be ready to pull out in 
autumn, and will be sound and fit for use until the following 
autumn. If sown thickly, they will mature perfectly hard. They 
are particularly valuable for pickling. 

RED, YELLOW OR WHITE BOTTOM SETS. 

No. 986. — ^The sets are produced by sowing the seed very thickly 
in the spring, without thinning them out; they mature when about 
one inch up. Their use is precisely the same as the Top Onions — 
to set them out in the spring instead of sowing seed. The seed of 
the White Silver Skin or the White Portugal varieties, is used for 
the White Set. They do not keep as well as the others, but produce 
small white Onions early in the season. 

ENGLISH MULTIPLIER. 

No. 987. — ^Esteemed by many as the best variety for early use. 
It is large in size, of a mild, sweet sugary flavor, very early and a

Then put them in a flat saucepan with a pieoe of butter, a pinch of 
sugar and a little salt, and moisten them to cover with white broth. 
Set them in a moderate oven to glaze, tossing them over occasionally, 
so they will glaze evenly. These Onions are used with stews, beef 
a la mode, and for mixed vegetable garnitures. For large garni- 
tures the stuffed Onions may be used. For chops or small 
entrees the white or brown puree of Onions soubise is used. 
Small Onions, when plainly boiled and tossed over the fire (with the 
addition of a little Oream or Allemande sauce), may also be used. 

SMALL ONIONS BAKED FOB GABNITUBE, SPANISH STYLE.

green salads, and is preferred by many who do not like raw Onions. 

ONIONS CHOPPED, FOR FINE HERBS, ETC. 

No. 1006. — Onions should never be chopped (as would be im- 
plied by the term cliop)^ but should be finely cut with a knife. 
When the Onions are peeled, cut them in halves, take one part and 
slice it finely without detaching the pieces; then slice it the same 
way crosswise; then cut straight down. In this way you can make 
the pieces of any desired size, and will always have them uniform 
and perfectly square. If chopped Onions are to be kept for some 
time, dip them in boiling water for one minute, then immerse them 
in cold water, drain them on a towel, and wring the moisture from 
them. In this manner, the Onions will remain white. If treated 
difterently, they will soon turn black.

FAGGOT OF PARSLEY. 



No. 1039.— A faggot of Parsley generally consists of a bunch of 
green Parsley, in the center of which a bay leaf, a sprig of thyme, 
and a few grains of cIotcs are put, the bunch being tied together 
with a string. It is used for flavoring soups, stews, etc. The edges 
should always be nicely trimmed. Celery and leeks are sometimes 
added to the faggot. 

' CHOPPED PARSLEY. 

No. 1040. — Take fresh Parsley leaves, wash them in cold water 
and dry them on a towel. Chop them finely on a clean board, then 
put the Parsley in a towel and wring out all of the moisture. Then 
put it in a bowl and keep it ready for use. When chopped Parsley 
. is used for sauces it should be dipped in boiling water for a minute, 
then immersed in cold water and wrung dry in a towel. By doing 
this it will retain its green color. 

FRIED PARSLEY FOR GARNISHINQ. 

No. 1041. — ^Pick and wash a bunch of Parsley and dry it in a 
towel. Have some hot lard or grease in a frying-pan on the fire,

ley remains in water too long, it acquires a bad odor. When gar- 
nishing dishes, which are to be covered and have to remain for 
some time before serving, it is best to use fried Parsley. Fresh 
Parsley is best as a garniture for cold dishes of meat. Parsley

PEA-NUT. 

Arachis, . Erdnus. 

No. 1054. — ^The Pea-nut is an annual plant, a native of Central 
America and Africa. The stem, when full grown, is about fourteen 
inches in height. The leaves are primate, with four leaflets, and a 
leafy, emarginate appendage at the base of the petals. The fruit 
or pod is of an oblong form, often contracted at the middle, but 
sometimes of bottle form, reticulated, and of a yellowish color. 
The kernels, of which the pod contains from one to three, are 
oblong, quite white, and are enclosed in a thin brown skin or 
pellicule. A remarkal^e peculiarity of this plant is that the lower 
blossoms alone produce the fruit. After the decay of the petals 
the ovaries insinuate themselves into the ground, beneath which at 
a depth of several inches, the fruit is afterwards perfected. They 
are eaten roasted, and are used by confectioners, and for culinary 
purposes as a substitute for almonds. 

CULTURE. 

No. 1055. — ^The Pea-nut succeeds well only in warm climates. 
Plant them as early as the weather becomes suitable, in a warm, 
light, loamy soil, deeply ploughed and pulverized, in rows a foot 
apart. In planting, the Pea-nut should be unbroken in the pod, and 
as soon as the flower appears the vines are earthed up from time to 
time, so as to keep them chiefly within the ground. 

APRICAN PEA-NUT.

French PEAS. 

Pots. Erbsen. 

No. 1059. — ^The Pea is a hardy annual plant, and its cultiva- 
tion is almost universal. The green Pea is a delicious vegeta- 
ble, and is highly esteemed for its flavor and taste. To have them 
in perfection they must be plucked before they mature, and should 
be shelled and cooked as soon after as possible, as they lose much 
of their tenderness and flavor if kept for any length of time. The 
fact that those brought from a distance seldom reach the markets 
in their perfect state is an objection to their use, which, coupled 
with the knowledge that when they are closely packed they become 
intensely overheated and are rendered devoid of taste and unwhole- 
some, deters many from using this popular vegetable. When sent 
from a distance they should be packed in open baskets (not in boxes, 
barrels or sacks), and laid in layers two inches deep, alternating 
with layers of clean straw. There are hundreds of varieties, but 
they differ very little from each other. New kinds are introduced 
annually, each claiming to be superior sorts, but the locality has a 
great deal to do with their quality. The field Peas can be used in 
their dry state for purees and soups, but they are not as easily 
digested as the other kinds. 

CULTURE. 

No. 1060. — Peas come earliest to maturity in light rich soil. For 
a general crop a deep loam or a soil strongly inclining today is best. 
For an early crop decomposed leaves or leaf mold should be used, 
or, if the soil is very poor, stronger manure may be used. For 
general crops a good dressing should be applied, and for the dwarf 
growing kinds the soil cannot be too rich. When grown as a 
maiket crop Peas are never staked, and are sown in single rows 
two or three inches deep and from two to three feet apart, according 
to variety or the strength of the soil. When grown in small 
quantities for private use, they are generally sown in double rows

newly burned pine lands. It has a branching, purplish stem, and 
large oval-pointed entire leaves. The fruit consists of a flat, purple, 
juicy berry, which is sometimes used as a purple dye. The annual 
Phytolacca is less vigorous and stocky. Sow the seeds in April, in 
drills, fifteen inches apart. The young shoots are boiled and 
served the same as sea kale. In taste it is similar to asparagus. 
The roots are used for medicinal purposes, and when taken 
internally act as a violent emetic.

roundish, of a dark bluish-green color, wrinkled on the surface and 
slightly undulating on the borders. The midrib of the leaf is large, 
thick, nearly white, and branches into veins. It forms a loose head 
and when full grown is nearly two feet high. Different parts of the 
Oabbage are used for culinary purposes. The ribs of the outer and 
large leaves, when boiled, somewhat resemble the sea-kale, both in 
texture and flavor. The heart, or middle, of the plant is, however, 
the best for use, as it is delicate and agreeably flavored, being 
without any of the coarseness often found in the common Cabbage. 
It is cultivated in the same n^anner as the common Cabbage. See

No. 1132. — The Potato is an esculent and farinaceous plant, and a 
native of South America. In its wild, natural state, the tuber rarely 
exceeds an inch in diameter, and is comparativelv unpalatable, 
but owing to cultivation they have greatly increased both in size 
and variety. There are over two hundred varieties, some of which 
are far superior to others, much depending on the culture and the 
soil in which they are grown. They are considered the most impor- 
tant of all the esculent roots, and a valuable article of human subsist- 
ence. The Potato is a healthful and nourishing vegetable, being 
agreeable to most all constitutions. It can be obtained throughout 
the year, and may be prepared without much trouble. The Potato 
is also used for other preparations. The Potato flour (fecula) is 
used by invalids and confectioners, and is mixed into the prepara- 
tions of the common sorts of chocolate. The Potato blossom is 
used in making paint, and the leaves when dried are used by tobac- 
conists. 

CULTURE. 

No. 1133. — ^The soil best suited for the Potato is of the drier and 
lighter description; pasture land or new land with the turf freshly 
turned, producing the most abundant as well as the most certain 
crop. When grown in land of a stiff clayish texture, or in wet soils, 
they are not only extremely liable to disease, but the quality is also 
very inferior. If the soil is good but little manure will be required. 
In highly enriched soil the plants appear to be more liable to dis-

«ase than when grown in soil that is naturally good. The best 
fertilizers are those of a dry or absorbent nature, such as plaster 
lime, superphosphate of lime, and bone dust. For wet soil these 
are particularly beneficial, as they not only promote growth, but 
prevent disease. The Potato is propagated from tubers, which are 
-either divided into sets, or planted entire. Whichever practice 
may be adopted, experience has proven that plants from well ripened 
tubers are not only more healthful and more productive, but actually 
<5ome to perfection earlier than those produced from immature sets. 
Potatoes are usually planted either in hills or ridges, the former 
method being the most common in this country. If planted in hills 
they should be made three feet apart, on light warm soil. They 
require covering nearly four inches deep, but in cold, wet situations 
two and a half inches will be suflScient. Cultivation should be 
•commenced as soon as the young shoots are fairly above the surface, 
and as the season advances gather the earth gradually about the 
hills or long drills, adding a little at each successive hoeing for the 
support of the growing plants, and to encourage the development 
of the rich roots, for it is at the extremity of the roots that the 
tubers are found. After the appearance of the blossoms cultivation 
should be discontinued, and no further attention will be required 
nntil the time for harvesting. The season of maturity of the 
earlier sorts will be indicated by the decay of the plants. The 
later sorts will continue their growth until checked by frost, pre- 
vious to which time they will not be ready for harvesting. New 
Potatoes may be had in the Southern States and in California in 
February and March, and in the Northern States as early as May 
or June, when the weather is practicable. 

The table should be supplied from day to day directly from the 
field or garden, as the tubers rapidly deteriorate after being taken 
from the ground, especially if exposed to a warm, light atmosphere, 
or when kept in a warm, dry cellar. In the preservation of potatoes 
it is of the first importance that they be excluded from light (if this 
is neglected they become injured). Fermentation is also an im- 
portant evil to be guarded against, as it changes the whole substance 
of the Potato. Of the many old and new varieties that claim public 
favor the following are selected : 

EARLY MAYFLOWER. 

No. 1134. — Eipens very early, and in quality is claimed to be 
equal tb the Snowflake. It is, in fact, a cross between the Snow- 
flake and Peachblow. The tubers are of medium size and run very 
uniform, being slightly flattened, oval shaped, and of a light lemon 
color. The skin is well covered with very fine netting, and has

very few eyes. The flesh is white and solid. It cooks evenly and 
thoroughly, without falling to pieces, and has no hard core, so com- 
mon to other sorts. 

wall's orange. 

No. 1135. — Unsurpassed as a table variety. Its color is very 
distinct, being of a decided orange hue, from which it derives its 
name. It is unequaled in quality and productiveness, and one of 
the strongest growers. 

JUMBO. 

No. 1136. — This is one of the largest growing Potatoes in cultiva- 
tion, being at least one-third larger than the Peerless. It seems to 
be entirely free from rot and is one of the very best keepers. The 
tubers are nearly round, the skin white, the eyes small and sunken 
and the flesh white and of excellent flavor. Either baked or boiled 
they are dry and mealy. 

CHAMPION OF AMERICA. 

No. 1137. — The tubers are flesh-colored and the eyes carmine, 
small and even with the surface. It grows to an immense size on 
strong ground, producing tubers as heavy as three pounds in weight. 
It is a tremendous yielder, one of the best of keepers, and is not to 
be excelled for cooking purposes. 

ROCHESTER FAVORITE. 

No. 1138. — A late variety that is white, oval-oblong and very 
uniform in size. An immense yielder and a handsome variety, 
excellent for table use. 

SAINT PATRICK.

tuber as many as thirty or forty of good quality. 

VERMONT CHAMPION. 

No. 1147. — Grows to an immense size; of fine shape and a good 
jdelder. 

PEACH BLOW. 

No. 1148. This variety is well known, as it is planted in immense 
quantities all over the country. It is very productive and ripens 
about the same time as the Burbank. The tubers are of medium 
size, oval-oblong, and very handsomely formed. A good keeper, 
and one of the very best for transportation.

£esh. 

CARTER. 

No. 1151. — A medium sized, round, flattened white Potato, and 
one of the finest varieties, with numerous deeply sunk eyes. The 
flesh is white, remarkably dry, farinaceous and well-flavored. 

BUCKEYE. 

No. 1152. — A handsome round Potato, with a little bright pink at 
the bottom of the eyes. It is grown to a considerable extent in the 
Western States. It cooks dry and light, and is well flavored when 
grown for early use. When grown for a late crop, in rich ground, 
many of the tubers are liable to be hollow in consequence of their 
rapid growth, thus impairing their value for table use. 

CALIFORNIA RED. 

No. 1153. — A bright red Potato, having tubers that vary in form 
from long to nearly round. One of the most productive of all the 
varieties, but its liability to disease accounts for it not being gen- 
erally cultivated. 

BOILED POTATOES. 

No. 1154. — Wash the Potatoes in cold water and remove all the 
small particles attached to them. Then put them into a saucepan 
with water to cover, add a little salt, put on the cover and set them 
on a brisk fire to bring them to a boil. Then set them on the side 
of the fire to let them boil moderately. As soon as they are done 
drain off the water, replace the cover tightly and set the Potatoes 
on the stove again for five minutes to dry them. If the Potatoes 
are good the flesh will be dry, white and mealy. Serve them in a 
napkin. 

Note. —Do not let Potatoes boll too quick, nor let them remain in tbe water after tbey have been 
boiled. 

BOILED PEELED POTATOES. 

No. 1155. — Peel the Potatoes and wash them in cold water (have 
them as near alike in size as possible). Put them into a saucepan, 
three-quarters full of cold water, add a little salt, put on the cover

Fry the onion to a light brown color and add a little fresh bread 
crumbs. Toss this over a brisk fire, and when browned pour it 
over the Potatoes. 

STEAMED POTATOES. 

No. 1158. — Steamed Potatoes are preferred by some to boiled 
Potatoes, and those that are not of the best quality will be found 
better when steamed than boiled. Have a small boiler three-quarters 
full of water. When the water boils set on top of this boiler an- 
other one with perforated holes in the bottom, and into this put the 
Potatoes, adding a little salt to them. Cover them tightly with a 
perforated cover. When the steam comes through freely the Pota- 
toes will be done. Serve them in the same way as boiled Potatoes. 
Where vegetables are cooked by steam power, perforated baskets 
are made to fit the boilers, and in this case the faucets must be left 
open so that no water can accumulate in the boiler.

small round pieces of Potato in Aspic jelly and arrange them nicely 
around the inside of the mould close together, to form a solid wall. 
(They may be alternated with sliced beets or gherkins.) When 
this is done, line the inside again with Aspic jelly to fill up the in- 
terstices.

naise dressing with Aspic jelly (see Book on Sauces). Season it 
highly. Mix it with the Potatoes quickly, before the dressing be- 
comes hard, and put the mixture in the mould to fill it. Then 
smooth off the surface evenly and keep the mould in a cool place 
until ready to use it. When ready to serve it, dip the mould in 
lukewarm water, dry it with a napkin, turn it over on a dish and 
remove the mould carefully. 

Note.— This can be garnished with a variety of vegetables, and Its success depends altogether 
npon the care taken In prei>arlng It. It may be filled with mixed vegetables, bat they mast be dried 
thoroughly before using. Care must be taken In making the Aspic Mayonnaise, which should be 
seasoned well. Only fresh and tender vegetables should be used.

ends. The plant may be cut for use when about five inches high, 
and is pickled, or may be boiled tlie same way as spinach. 

COMMON PURSLAIN. 

No. 1225. — This kind grows abundantly in gardens and cultivated 
fields. The green and the golden Purslain are improved sub- 
varieties, and though considered more succulent than the common 
Purslain, they will hardly repay one for the trouble of cultivating 
them, the difference in quality being very slight. The common 
variety is the kind in general use. Sow it in shallow drills, at any 
time from April to July. It thrives well in any soil.

AUTUMN AND WINTER RADISHES. 

No. 1246. — These varieties may be sown from the middle of July 
to the middle of August. The soil should be made light and pliable 
and should be watered well in dry weather. Radishes may be 
obtained in September and October direct from the garden. For 
winter use the roots should be harvested before the ground freezes, 
and should be packed in earth or sand, out of danger from frost. 
They should be immersed in cold water before being used. They 
are served as salad, the same as the spring or summer varieties.

Primevere, Schliiaaelblume, 

No. 1260. — This is a hardy biennial plant that grows abundantly 
on the roadsides in this country. The roots, which are the only 
parts used, are, when full grown, about ten inches long, of fusiform, 
and have strong fibres. The whitish, thick outer skin peels off 
readily, and should always be removed. It has a nutty flavor when 
eaten raw, and is inferior to the true Rampion, being slightly pun-

THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE. 291 

The leaf stalks are large, furrowed, succulent, and of a pale green 
color, often stained or finely spotted with red, and varying from 
two to three inches in diameter at the broadest part, and from one 
to three feet in length. The stalks are used for pies, tarts, jellies, 
and for various medicinal purposes. The juice makes a tolerably 
palatable wine. 

CULTURE. 

No. 1270. — Bhubarb succeeds best in deep, and somewhat re- 
tentive soil; the richer its condition, and the deeper it is stirred, 
the better. Sow the seeds in drills, cover them with one inch of 
soil, and thin out the plants to six inches apart. Trench a piece of 
ground in the fall, manure it well, and transplant the young plants 
in the trench, three feet apart each way. Cover them with leaves 
during the first winter, and give them a dressing of coarse manure 
every fall. The stalks should not be plucked until the third year 
and the plant should never be allowed to run to seed. Seeds can 
never be relied upon to produce the same variety. The varieties 
are quite numerous, but those of good quality are limited in number. 

downing' S COLOSSAL. 

No. 1271. — This is one of the best and largest varieties, having a 
fine, rich, aromatic flavor. Stalks of medium size are the best for

292 HAHDEB^S AMEBICAN COOKERY. 

wyatt's VICTORU, 

No. 1275. — A productive variety, with large leaf-stalks, about 
three inches broad and over two feet long. They are reddish at 
the base and are often finely spotted with red to the nerves of the 
leaves. The skin is thick and the flesh is not very highh flavored. 

CAHOON. 

No. 1276. — The stalks are short and thick, the skin being thick 
and green. The texture is coarse and the flavor harsh and strong. 
It is seldom cultivated for culinary purposes, being used princi- 
pally in the manufacture of wine. The juice is pressed from the 
stalks, and to each gallon three and a half pounds of sugar is 
added. The wine is quite palatable, but lacks the fine aroma of 
grape wine. Any of the other varieties may be used for wine, 
sugar being added according to their sweetness. 

RHUBARB WINE. 

No. 1277. — Cut half a pound of Ehubarb roots into small pieces, 
put them in an earthen jar, and moisten them with one quart of 
wine spirits (alcohol). Six days later add one gallon of dry white 
wine to it and cover the jar tightly. Ten days later filter it and put 
it into bottles. A wine-glassful taken every morning before break- 
fast is said to be very healthful. 

RHUBARB^WATER. 

No. 1278. — Cutjsix ounces of Ehubarb roots into small pieces, put 
them in a quart bottle, fill the bottle with water, and set it aside for 
three days. The water diminishes phlegm, strengthens the stomach, 
and facilitates digestion. Take a wine-glassful at dinner time and 
mix it with wine. Ee-fill the bottle when any is taken out and 
renew the quantity of Ehubarb roots every two weeks. 

STEWED RHUBARB. 

No. 1279. — Stewed Rhubarb is used as a relish and for pies and 
tarts. Peel and cut two pounds of Ehubarb into pieces about an 
inch long, parboil them for two minutes, then drain and put them 
into a saucepan, with four spoonfuls of cold water, and set it on a 
brisk fire, occasionally stirring it with a wooden spoon. When 
nearly cooked, sweeten it to taste, and let it cook until tender. 

Note.— When cooked to be served as a relish, the pieces should be kept whole, and in order to do 
this It is only necessary to be a little more careful in cooking them and not stir them too much. 
Rhubarb, after being cooked, must always be kept in an earthen bowl or Jar and coyered with paper.

FrcBcJi RICE. 

Jiu, JteU 

No. 1280. — Eice is a native of the Orient, where it is a staple 
food. The best and finest quality is now grown in South Carolina. 
After bread it is the most healthful nourishment known. It is pre- 
pared for food in many diffeient ways as a vegetable, and is exten- 
sively used, when ground into a flour, by pastry cooks for puddings, 
creams, cakes, etc., which ^ill be described in the Book on Pastry. 
In China an intoxicating wine is made from it. In selecting Bice 
care should be taken to see that the grains are whole, for when they 
are broken, or the Bice is of inferior quality, it cannot be prepared 
properly. When it is properly cooked the grains should remain 
entire, and should not stick together. There is but one species. 
The plant is cultivated in warm climates in America, and grows best 
in low, moist soil, which can be overflowed. It is a light, nutritious 
food, and is easily digested. 

BOILED BICE, PLAIN. 

No. 1281. — Wash one pound of Eice in cold water, and then put 
it in a saucepan with' some lightly salted water. Stir it until it 
boils, so it will not become attached to the bottom of the pan. Then 
cover the saucepan and let it cook slowly for twenty minutes. After 
this set it on the side of the fire to allow the moisture to become 
dry. It may be served as a vegetable or a garniture, and in soups 
where Bice is required. 

BOILED BICE (ANOTHEB WAY). 

No. 1282. — Wash one pound of Bice in cold water, then drain it 
and put it into a saucepan. Pour over it twice as much cold water 
as there is Rice, seetson with salt and add a piece of butter. After 
it has boiled six minutes, cover the pan and let it cook slowly for 
twenty minutes. The Eice should then be cooked dry. When 
cooked in this manner it is used as a vegetable, and for garnitures 
or borders. 

STEAMED BICE. 

No. 1283. — ^Eice is the same, either steamed or boiled, differing 
only in the mode of cooking. Wash and drain the Eice and put it 
in a saucepan or a can. Pour over it twice as much cold water as

saucepan and moisten it with broth enough to cover the Bice one 
and a half times its depth. Season with salt, cover the saucepan 
and set it on the fire. As soon as it boils set it on the side of the 
fire, let it boil slowly for twenty minutes, and then the Rice will be 
cooked dry. Then add six ounces of butter, divided into small 
pieces, and a pinch of nutmeg, and mix them gently with a wooden 
spoon. Rice cooked in this way is used for garnitures, borders, 
Timbals, soups, etc.

a buttered paper cover, and set the mould in a moderate oven 
for fifteen minutes. Then take it out, set it on the dish it is to 
be served on, and in five minutes lift off the mould carefully. 
Then fill the center of the border with the preparation intended 
for it. 

Note.— When Rice is used for garnishing side dishes, it may be moulded in a Charlotte mould, 
or in a deep kitchen spoon. For the latter style dip the spoon in warm water, fill it with Bice, then 
gently press the Rice into an oval shape In the spoon. Then place the Rice on the dish that Is to he 
garnished. 

RICE FOR PUREES OR BISQUE SOUPS. 

No. 1286. — Eice is used in thickening Purees and Bisque or Cream 
soups, to which it imparts a delicacy for which these soups should 
always be distinguished. Wash the Rice in cold water, drain it, 
and put it into a saucepan. Pour over it four times as much chicken 
or veal broth as there is Eice, season with salt and add a piece of 
butter, one carrot and one onion, having four cloves stuck into it. 
Cover the saucepan and let the Eice cook until it is thoroughly 
done. Then take out the onion and carrot, put the Eice into a 
mortar and pound it into a fine paste. It may then be used as 
directed in the Book on Soups.

RICE CRUSTS, OR STANDS FOR HOT OR COLD SIDE DISHES. 

No. 1330. — Crusts upon which side dishes are dressed, are gen- 
erally out from bread and are formed in various shapes, but those 
of Rice will be found much better and more secure, as they are 
very firm and will not soften like the bread, especially when the 
dish to be served must remain on the table for some time. Besides 
this, the whiteness of the Rice, when the crust is well made, presents 
a much more pleasing effect than the bread; This will be found 
to be the case, especially in cold dishes, owing to the fact that the 
Rice can be cut or carved into any shape after it has been moulded, 
but it requires experience and practice to shape them nicely. 

HOW TO COOK RICE FOR CRUSTS OR STANDS. 

No. 1331. — Wash four pounds of Rice in plenty of cold water and 
drain it. Then put it in a saucepan and pour over it three times 
as much water as there is Rice. Add a little salt and a small piece 
of butter and set it on the fire to boil, stirring it well. Six minutes 
after this, put the cover on the pan tightly, and set in a moderate 
oven for one hour, when the rice will be cooked dry. (If any of the 
Rice on top has become browned, remove it.) Then take the Rice 
from the saucepan with a spoon, being careful not to remove any 
that adheres to the side or bottom of the pan. Put it in a mortar, 
pound it to a fine paste and put it on a clean table board. Then 
dip your hands in cold water and work the Rice well together. 
Then butter a mould of the desired shape, till it with the Rice, and 
smooth the surface evenly. Put a buttered paper cover on top, and 
on this place a wooden cover that will fit inside of the mould. A 
heavy weight must be put on the board to press the Rice down 
solid. Then set it aside for ten hours to get cold, and, when ready 
to use it, dip the mould in hot water and turn the Rice out on a dish. 
Then cut the Rice into any shape desired with a small sharp knife, 
and keep it covered with a damp napkin until wanted.

No. 1350. — Eye is a hardy (secale cereal) plant and is closely 
allied to wheat. The grain is ground into flour and constitutes a 
large portion of breadstuff*. The Eye flour is the best for making 
a cake called congloffs, which is of Polish origin. The various

CULTURE. 

No. 1351. — ^The time for sowing is from the middle of August to 
the first of September, and it succeeds best in sandy soil. One 
ploughing is given, and the seed is sown broadcast. If cut before 
it is fully ripe, the grain makes better flour and produces a larger 
quantity. If intended for seed, the grain should be fully ripe.

French SAFFRON. Geniur 

Safran. Saffron^ 

No. 1352. — The common cultivated Saffron is a perennial plant. 
It is cultivated for its flowers, which are large, of a beautiful lilac 
color, and are used in dyeing, and to make the cosmetic called 
Eouge. The Saffron has been known for ages in Greece and Asia 
Minor. There are several different varieties. The French Saffron 
is much superior in color, and the Spanish is the best in flavor. 
The Saffron is cultivated in the United States as a garden flower 
only. The flowers are gathered after they show themselves, as their 
period of flowering is very short. The stigmas, or summits of tha 
petals, with a portion of the style, are separated from the remain- 
der of the flower, and are carefully dried by attificial heat, or in the 
sun. During this process they are made into the form of a cake, 
by pressure; but the finest Spanish Saffron is dried loosely. They 
are distinguished by the name of cake, or hay-Saffron. It must be 
kept in a dry place, in well-stopped vessels. Saffron has a peculiar 
aromatic odor, a warm, pungent, bitter taste, and a rich, deep 
orange color. When soaked in water it colors the liquid an orange- 
yellow color. It is much used in the Spanish and Southern coun- 
tries for culinary purposes, for flavoring soups and rice dishes, and 
also by confectioners, and for medicinal purposes. From the seed 
a fixed oil is obtained somewhat similar to that of the sunflower. 
On account of the high price of the Spanish Saffron it is adulterated 
frequently. The flowers of other plants, such as safflower, marigold 
and arnica, are mixed with the genuine stigmas. They may be de- 
tected by their shape, which is rendered obvious by putting a 
portion of the so-called Saffron in hot water, which will cause them 
to expand. Much of this is to be found in the United States, and is 
sold under the name of African Saffron. Other adulterations are 
made with yellow-colored chalk, or sulphate of barrium, made into 
a thin paste, probably with honey, and attached to stigmas. The 
pure Saffron will always be clear when diluted with water, assuming 
a fine pure yellow tint, and the Saffron its red color.' Less than the 
ordinary brightness of color in the Saffron should lead to the sus- 
picion of adulteration. Saffron should not be very moist nor dry. 
The freshest is the best and should not be over a year old. When 
it is put in acidulated water it should color it bright yellow.

medicinal properties. It is cultivated principally for use as a condi^ 
ment, and is used more extensively than any other herb, both green 
and in a dried state, for seasoning stuffings, meats, stews and soups. 
It is also used for flavoring cheese, and, in the form of a decoction, 
is sometimes employed for medicinal purposes. It should be gath- 
ered for drying before the development of the flowering shoots;, 
and when cultivated for its leaves, the shoots should be cut off as 
they make their appearance. The product will be largely increased, 
as the leaves are put forth in much greater numbers and attain 
larger size. 

CULTURE. 

No. 1355. — Sow it early in spring, in very rich ground. Cultivate 
it often and thin the plants to sixteen inches apart. The plants- 
will survive the winter, and, if divided, will give a second crop 
superior to the first in quality.

French SAGO. Germtt 

Sayou. Sago, 

No. 1361.—- Sago is a dry, granulated starch that is imported from 
the East Indies. It is the prepared pith of the Sago and other 
palms. Numerous trees in the East Indies and on the coast of the 
Indian Ocean, contain a fariuHceous pith which is prepared for 
nutriment by the natives. The Sago Palm is one of the smallest, 
its height seldom exceeding thirty feet. The trunk is thick, erect 
and cylindrical, and is covered with a beautiful crown of foliage, of 
large, pinniate leaves, extending in all directions from the summit 
and curving gracefully downwards. The medullary matter contains 
most of the starch. When the large leaves have fallen off and the 
flowers commence to take their place, the tree is felled and the 
trunk is cut into billets about six feet long, which 'are then split to 
facilitate the extraction of the pith, which is obtained in the state 
of a coarse powder. This is mixed with water in a trough having 
a strainer at the end. The water, loaded with farina, passes through 
the strainer and is received in convenient vessels, where it is 
allowed to stand until it has settled. It is then drained off and the 
farina is dried and formed into cakes by the natives. The Sago as

sold here is prepared by forming the meal into a paste with water, 
and rubbing it into grains. This is produced in the greatest 
abundance in the Moluccas, but the finest quality comes from the 
Eastern coast of Sumatra, in Malacca and Singapore. It is refined 
so as to give the grains a fine pearly lustre. This is what is called 
Pearl Sago, which is the kind generally used. It is a small 
grain about the size of a pin-head. The common Sago is larger, and 
the grains are of a more unequal size and of a duller aspect, being 
mixed with more or less dirty looking powder. Sago is used as an 
article of diet, being nutritive and digestible, and wholly destitute 
of irritating properties. 

SAGO FOR INVALIDS. 

No. 1362. — In its preparation care must be taken to boil it long 
in water or broth. Drop it into boiling water or broth while 
stirring it, so the grains will dissolve thoroughly and not form in 
lumps. Should any portion not be dissolved it must be strained, 
as it might offend a delicate stomach. A table-spoonful of Sago 
t<) a pint of water is sufficient for ordinary purposes. It may be 
seasoned with sugar, nutmeg or other spices, and wine may be 
added if advisable. 

SAGO GRUEL. 

No. 1363. — Boil one quart of water in a saucepan and then drop 
in three spoonfuls of Sago slowly, while stirring it with a wooden 
spoon. When it boils steadily, set it on the side of the fire to boil 
slowly and add a pinch of salt. In three-quarters of an hour add 
a wine-glassful of good white wine, the juice of one lemon, a soup- 
spoonful of powdered sugar and a pinch of nutmeg. Serve it hot 
or put it in an earthen bowl and serve it when cold. 

SAGO POR SOUPS. 

No. 1364. — Drop the amount of Sago necessary in boiling broth, 
or consomme, stirring it until it boils steadily. Sago is added to 
many purees and cream soups as a garniture. Sago or tapioca with 
chicken or veal broth, is partaken of in the morning by prima donnas 
to a considerable extent. 

SAGO SOUP WITH CREAM. 

No. 1365. — Wash the Sago in cold water, then drop it in a sauce- 
pan containing one quart of chicken broth, and lefc it boil slowly 
until well cooked. Then season it lightly and add half a pint of

SalsiJU, HafertDurzeL 

No. 1367. — Salsify is a hardy biennial plant, and is principally 
cultivated for its roots, the flavor of which resembles that of oysters. 
The leaves are long and grass-like. The roots are long and tapering, 
like the parsnip, and when grown in good soil measure about ten 
inches in length and an inch in diameter. Their flavor is sweet and 
delicate, and they are said to contain medicinal properties which 
have a tendency to alleviate consumption. 

CULTUBE. 

No. 1368. — Salsify succeeds best in a light and well enriched soil, 
which should be worked to a depth of twelve inches. The manure 
should be well rotted, for when fresh and coarse the roots will grow 
irregular and ill-shaped. Sow early and quite deep, and give the 
same general culture as for parsnips. The i*oots are hardy and may 
remain out all winter, but should be dug early in the spring as they 
deteriorate rapidly after growth commences. For winter use store 
them in the sand. 

HOW TO PREPARE IT FOR COOKING.

No. 1404. — Put three quarts of clear white broth in a saucepan, 
add a small piece of butter, season with salt and, when it boils, add 
in slowly two pounds of Semoule, stirring it gently, so it will not 
^et lumpy. Then set it on the side of the fire to cook slowly until 
thoroughly cooked, keeping it firm. When done take it off of the 
flre and add two ounces of butter and six ounces of grated Parmesan 
«heese. Mix it well together and put it in a buttered square tin 
pan, having the mixture about one and a half inches deep. Smooth 
the surface evenly, cover it with a buttered paper cover and set it 
aside to get cold. Then turn it out on a table and, with a round 
cutter the size of a dollar, cut out as many pieces as possible. Boll 
them in fresh bread crumbs, dip them in beaten eggs, and then 
bread them again. Form them nicely in shape and, with a cutter 
the size of a twenty-five cent piece, make a slight impression on the 
ix>p of each to mark the cover. Then fry them in hot lard and, 
when nicely browned, 4jain them and in a few minutes take off the 
cover and scoop out the center, being careful not to injure the crust. 
Keep them warm until ready for use. Then make a garniture of 
small boiled macaroni (spaghetti), cut in pieces a quarter of an inch 
long, mixed with the same quantity of small pieces of the breast of 
roasted quails or partridges, and an equal quantity of lean boiled 
liam and artichoke bottoms cut in small pieces. Put the garniture 
in a reduced Madeira wine sauce, add a few drops of lemon juice 
and mix it gently together. Then fill the crusts with the garniture 
and serve hot.

Semoule and smooth it neatly with a knife, leaving the centre hol- 
low. Then fill them with the above garniture, cover the top with 
Semoule, allowing it to form on top in a semi-oval shape, and 
smooth it off neatly. Set them aside to get cold and firm. Then 
take them out of the moulds and dip them in a cool Yilleroi sauce, 
place them in a pan side by side, and set the pan on the ice sa 
the sauce will adhere to them. Then trim them nicely, roll them 
in fresh bread crumbs, dip them in beaten eggs and bread them 
again. (Handle them very carefully.) Now fry them in hot

FreacH SPICES. 

JE^tctf. Wune, 

No. 1438. — Spices are used to season, aromatize a];id enrich 
numerous culinary preparations. They are all vegetable substances 
with the exception of salt. Their importance cannot be overesti- 
mated as they are used constantly, yet often wrongfully. The art 
of spicing or seasoning properly is one that must be acquired, and 
experience is the best teacher. Many preparations would be indi- 
gestible and almost tasteless without the use of spices. Salt is 
probably used most, and after it comes the onions, shallots, 
chives, and garlic. The onion is used principally as an 
alimentary substance, while the others may be considered 
energetic stimulants to the appetite. High seasoning, is more in 
vogue in the Southern States and in all warm climates, than in the 
North. The French, as a rule, use less strong spices in cooking 
than any other nation, preferring aromatic herbs instead, which 
answer the same purpose and are less exciting. India furnishes the 
major portion of strong spices, such as mulligatawny, chutney, 
•curry, etc. 

SPICES FOR SALTED BEEF. 

No. 1439. — Home-made spices are far superior to many of those 
bought from dealers, as the latter kinds are generally adulterated, 
and if not kept tightly corked lose their aromatic flavor by evap- 
oration. The following is the best recipe for making Spices for 
salted beef: Procure the following quantities of dried herbs: Two 
ounces each of thyme, sage, nutmeg, cloves, mace, and bay leaves; 
three ounces of white pepper, and one ounce each of marjoram and 
rosemary. Then pound each kind separately in a mortar and sift 
them through a fine sieve. Put the mixture in bottles and keep 
them tightly corked. When ready to use it add one ounce of the 
Spice to one pound of salt. 

SPICED SALT, FOR STUFFINGS. 

No. 1440. — ^Procure the following quantities of dried herbs: One- 
half of an ounce each of powdered thyme, cloves, nutmeg, white or 
black pepper, and one-quarter of an ounce each of powdered bay 
leaves, marjoram, and red pepper. Mix them with one and a half 
pounds of fine salt, then put them Jin bottles and keep them tightly

Epinard, ^ SpinaL 

No. 1445. — Spinach is a hsLrdj annual plant, and is said to be of 
Asiatic origin. The leaves and young stems are the only parts of 
the plant that are used, being extremely wholesome and palatable, 
and retaining their bright green color after being cooked. The 
leaves are smooth and oval-oblong shaped, though varying in the 
different varieties. Spinach is prepared in various ways and is 
eaten with almost every kind of meat. The expressed juice is used 
to impart a greenish color to certain dishes. It affords but little 
nourishment, but when eaten freely, is mildly laxative, diuretic and 
cooling. 

GULTUBE. 

No. 1446. — ^It should be planted in very rich ground. Sow it a 
foot apart^ in drills, and commence thinning out the plants when 
the leaves are an inch wide. When they are two or three inchea 
wide, they will be fit to gather. This is done by cutting them up 
with a knife entirely to the bottom, or by only cropping the large 
outer leaves. The root and heart should remain to shoot out again 
according to the season.

Season with salt, pepper and nutmeg, and add a small piece of 
butter and the yolks of eight raw eggs. Mix the whole well to- 
gether and set it aside to get cold. Then pat some clarified butter 
in a frying pan, and drop the Spinach into it, one spoonful at a 
time, and manage it so that they will not touch each other. Fry 
them nicely on both sides; then serre them on a napkin and garnish 
with fried parsley. 

GREEN COLOR OF SPINACH. 

No. 1461. — Pick, wash and drain five large handfuls of Spinach. 
Then put it in a mortar, pound it finely and add six glassfuls of 
cold water. After this, strain it through a towel, pressing it well 
to extract all of the moisture. Then put it in a saucepan on the 
fire, and just before it boils, set it on the side of the fire, keeping 
it at the boiling heat, but not allowing it to boil. Then drain 
it in a fine hair sieve. That which remains in the sieve is used for 
coloring. 

Another way of making the green color is as follows : Throw 
three handftds of Spinach in some boiling water, with a little pars- 
ley and chives. Let it remain there one minute; then immerse it 
in cold water, drain it, and press it dry. Then put it in a mortar, 
pound it finely, and rub it through a fine sieve. After this moisten 
it with a little cold white broth. 

CREAM OF SPINACH. 

No. 1462. — Put four soup-spoonfuls of finely-chopped cooked 
Spinach and one dozen sweet almonds in a mortar, and pound them 
into a fine paste. Then add four macaroons made with bitter 
almonds, and sweeten with sugar to taste. Pound the whole well, 
and then add a quart of cream and the yolks of ten raw eggs. Mix 
them well together and strain the mixture through a sieve. Put it 
in a small mould and cook it the same as a custard.

are very palatable, while the winter sorts can be had in perfection 
in August. All of the varieties are tender annuals and thrive best 
in a warm temperature. 

CULTURE. 

No. 1464. — Plant them in warm weather, and cultivate them 
generally as you would cucumbers or melons, being particular about 
the soil. The summer varieties should be planted six feet apart 
each way, and the winter varieties at a distance of eight feet. Three 
plants are sufficient for one hill. Care should be taken not to 
injure or break the stems of those intended for winter use, as the 
slightest injury increases their liability to decay. 

SUMMER VARIETIES. 

APPLE SQUASH. 

No. 1465. — This variety is healthy and vigorous, but not stocky.

greenish-yellow color, dry and well flavored. It is one of the finest 
summer varieties, but is used only when young and tender and when 
the skin can be pierced easily. When the skin hardens the flesh 
becomes watery, strongly flavored and unfit for table use. 

EARLY YELLOW SCALLOPED BUSH SQUASH. 

No. 1467. — This is an erect, dwarf variety. The fruit is hemi- 
spherical in form, and expanded at the edge, which is deeply and 
regularly scalloped. It is yellow in color, and the skin, while 
young, is thin and easily pierced. When it matures the skin is 
hard and shell-like. The flesh is pale-yellow in color, finely 
grained and well flavored. It is not as dry as the summer crooked 
neck variety.

Fwnc-i SWEET POTATOES. ^ermiui 

Palate, B taten. 

No. 1498. — The Sweet Potato is a native of the East and West 
Indies, where it grows natural as a perennial plant, but when culti- 
vated it is always treated as an annual. They thrive well in the 
Southern States, but those grown in the North are much inferior, as 
the plants seldom blossom and the tubers never ripen perfectly. 
Though numerous varieties are cultivated, none can compare with 
those grown in the South. 

CULTURE. 

No. 1499. — The Sweet Potato is cultivated much in the same 
manner as our common potato, and succeeds best in light warm soil, 
which should be deeply stirred and well enriched. The slips or 
sprouts are planted twelve inches apart in ridges that are four feet 
wide. Give the plants ordinary culture in the summer, and early 
in October the tubers will have attained their growth and will be 
jready for harvesting. The slips or sprouts are generally obtained 
by setting the tubers in a hot-bed in March and breaking off the 
sprouts from them when they are five inches high. For transplant- 
ing in a favorable season the plucking may be repeated about four 
times. In setting out the slips the lower part should be sunk one- 
half of their depth, and when dry weather occurs water should be 
applied moderately. Dryness and a warm and even temperature are 
essential for the preservation of Sweet Potatoes, for if these condi- 
tions are not supplied the tubers will decay rapidly. They may be 
preserved until spring by packing them in dry sand and storing 
them in a warm dry room.

French TAPIOCA, OR ^ANIOCA. Germaa 

Tapioca, or Manioca. Tapioca. 

No. 1519. — Tapioca is a coarsely granular substance obtained by 
heating, and thus partly changing tho moistened starch obtained 
from the roots of the Janipha maniJiot, a plant which is a native of 
Brazil. There are two chief varieties, and about thirty sub-varieties. 
The root of the sweet cassavas may be eaten with impunity; that of 
the bitter, which is the most extensively cultivated, abounds in an 
acrid, milky juice, which renders it highly poisonous if eaten in the 
recent state. The root is prepared for use by washing, scraping 
and grating or grinding it into a pulp, which, in the bitter variety, 
is submitted to pressure so as to separate the deleterious juice. 
It is now in the state of meal or powder, which is made into bread, 
cakes or puddings. As the poisonous principle is volatile, the por- 
tion which may have remained in the meal is entirely dissipated by 
the heat employed in cooking. Being nutritious, and at the same 
time easy of digestion, and destitute of irritating properties. Tapi- 
oca forms an excellent diet for the sick and convalescent. It is pre- 
pared for use by boiling it in water, and is used, like sago, in soups 
and puddings. A factitious Tapioca, known as Pearl Tapioca, is 
made from potato starch, and is sometimes sold as the genuine 
article. 

Note.— The Tapioca obtained from grocers In tbe United States, Is In the form of bard, white. 
Irregular, rough grains. That which is sold under the name of Manloca, is smaller and finer, beii^ 
preferred to the large Tapioca.

roots. Select a warm, dry situation in April, and set the shoots in 
rows, fifteen inches apart, and cover them with three inches of soil. 
It is sometimes improved by cutting, when they are set three inches 
apart in moist earth. When not allowed to run to flower, the 
plants will be more healthy, and of finer quality, and will yield 
more abundantly. 

TARRAGON VINEGAR, PLAIN. 

No. 1523. — This is made by an infusion of the leaves in wine 
vinegar, and is greatly esteemed with salads.

TEA. 
Th4, Thee. 

No. 1525. — The Tea plant is a native of China and Japan, being 
cultivated extensively in both countries. In Japan it forms hedge- 
rows around the rice and cornfields; in China, whence immense 
quantities of Tea are exported, whole fields are devoted to its

culture. It is propagated from seeds, and in three years the plant 
yields leaves for collection, and in six years attains a height of five 
or six feet. After the leaves are gathered they are dried by artifi- 
cial heat, and while hot are rolled in the palms of the hands, so as 
to be broaght into the form in which they are found in commerce. 
The odor of the Tea leaves themselves is very slight, and it is 
customary to mix with them the flowers of certain aromatic plants, 
as those of the orange, jasmine, rose, etc!, in order to render 
them t)leasant to the smell. The flowers are afterwards separated 
*by sifting. There^are two principal varieties — the grefen and the 
black — which differ considerably in flavor and strength. By chem- 
ical tests it has been ascertained that green Tea is colored by sul- 
phate of calcium and Prussian blue. Tea is astringent and gently 
excitant, and in its finer varieties exerts a decided infiuence over 
the nervous system, producing exhilaration and wakefulness. When 
taken moderately it is perfectly harmless, but in large quantities it 
produces nervousness, dyspepsia, and excites the brain and stom- 
ach. Green Tea is more injurious than black Tea, and should not 
be used by those who are dyspeptic. 

TO MAKE TEA. 

No. 1526. — Tea is made in several different ways. 

The Chinese, who are supposed to know something about it, put 
a few Tea leaves in a cup, then pour boiling water over the leaves, 
and let them steep for a few minutes, having placed a saucer over 
the cup to keep the essence from evaporating. The liquid is then 
strained into another cup, previously warmed with hot water, and 
is ready for use. They use neither milk nor sugar, claiming that 
they injure the delicate aroma of the Tea, whiqh is true. 

The general method of making Tea in America is as follows: 
Use an earthen tea-pot in preference to one of metal. Scald the 
pot well; then put in the quantity of Tea desired, set the pot on 
the stove, pour over the Tea sufficient boiling water to cover it, and 
let it stand ten minutes to draw. Keep the cover on the pot, and 
do not let the Tea boil. Then pour in as much boiling water as 
is desired, and the Tea is ready for use. Do not pour water over 
Tea unless it is boiling hot, as unboiled water will not extract the 
flavor from the Tea leaves, and will spoil the Tea. Never let Tea 
boil after it is made. Use the tea-pot only for making Tea. Use 
cold cream in Tea. 

TEA, BUSSIAN STYLE. 

No. 1527. — ^An agreeable beverage is made as follows: Peel some 
fresh, juicy lemons, and slice them in thin pieces. Put one piece

in the bottom of each cup, sprinkle it with white sugar, and then 
pour in the hot Tea. Sometimes the lemon peel is not removed, 
which imparts a slightly bitter taste to the Tea. 

ICED TK\. 

No. 1528. — A delicious cold beverage for summer is made by 
making some mixed Tea (black and green), putting it in bottles, and 
setting them on the ice to cool. When ready to serve, pour the 
Tea in goblets, that contain some cracked ice, and sweeten it with 
sugar. A little champagne or rum may be added to each glass, if 
desired, but never add milk. 

AFTER-DINNER TEA. 

, No. 1529. — Tea may be served after dinner the same as coffee. 
Serve with some double cream or brandy or rum, whichever may 
be desired. Sandwiches or small cakes usually accompany it. 

TEA FOR INVALIDS. 

No. 1530. — Put the yolk of one raw egg and a teaspoonful of sugar 
in a bowl and mix them well together. Dilute it with four soup- 
spoonfuls of cold milk, then add a cup of hot Tea slowly while stir- 
ring it briskly. Serve immediately. 

TEA CUSTARD, IN CUPS. 

No. 1531. — Make a cupful of the best strong Tea and set it aside 
to cool. Then put the yolks of twelve raw eggs in a saucepan and 
add half a pound of powdered sugar. Mix them well together with 
a wooden spoon and then dilute it with the cold Tea. Add in slowly 
one quart of cooled boiled milk, stirring it gently. Then strain the 
mixture through a fine sieve and put it in custard cups. Set the 
cups in a flat saucepan containing hot water, which must reach up to 
the middle of the cups. Put the pan in a moderate oven, and as 
soon as the custard becomes firm take it out. Cover it if desired, 
while cooking. Do not let the water boil, or the custard will be full 
of little holes, instead of being solid throughout. 

Note.— Coffee custiurd may be made In the same way by using a cupful of strong, black coffee, 
instead of Tea.

Frcneli THYME. German 

Thym. Thymian, 

No. 1532. — ^There are two species of Thyme cultivated for culin- 
ary purposes: the Common Garden, and the Lemon or Evergreen 
Thyme, both of which are hardy perennial plants, having a shrubby 
character and a comparatively long growth. The leaves have an 
agreeable, aromatic taste, and are used for flavoring soups, stuffings 
and sauces. They should be used with moderation, as too much 
imparts a bitter taste to the substance. 

CULTURE. 

No. 1533. — ^They are propagated from seeds, or by dividing the 
roots; but the finest plants are produced from seeds. Sow them in 
April, in shallow drills twelve inches apart. They should be thinned 
out to eight inches apart, and all weeds should be carefully removed. 
They maybe cut for use as soon as they have made sufficient growth; 
but for drying, the stalks are gathered as they come into flower. 

BROAD-LEAVED THYME.

States, being served on the table the entire year in different forms, 
and is one of the most healthful and best of all garden vegetables. 
The plant, when full grown, is about eight feet high, with a branch- 
ing irregular recumbent stem and dense foliage. The fruit is red, 
white or yellow, and is exceedingly variable in size as well as form. 
The varieties are numerous, few of them appearing to be distinct or 
permanent. Much depends on the cultivation and the temperature 
of the soil. 

CULTURE. 

No. 1538. — The Tomato is raised from seed and succeeds best in 
light warm and not over rich soil. Success depends on securing a 
rapid, vigorous, unchecked growth during the early part of the sea- 
son. Sow it in hot beds during March, or from six to eight weeks 
before they can be set out of doors. When the plants have four 
leaves transplant them into shallow boxes, setting them five inches 
apart. Give them plenty of air and endeavor to secure a vigorous 
but steady and healthful growth, so that, at the time of setting them 
in tKe open ground, they will be strong and stocky and about as 
broad as they are high. A slight check, while the plants are young, 
will materially diminish their productiveness. Set them out of 
doors as soon as danger from severe frost is over, but before doing 
so harden off -the plants by gradually exposing them to the night 
air and by the withdrawal of water until the wood becomes hard 
and the leaves thick and of a dark green color. Transplant them 
carefully and cultivate well as long as the vines will permit. The 
fruit is improved in quality if the vines are tied to a trellis or to 
stakes. Sufficient plants for the garden of a small family may be 
started with little trouble by sowing a few seeds about the middle 
of March in a garden box or large flower pot and placing it in a 
sunny window of the kitchen. Transplant them in the open ground 
as soon as the weather will permit and the plant is strong enough. 

To have an extra large and beautiful Tomato, as soon as a cluster 
of flowers is visible top the stems down to the cluster, so that the 
flowers terminate the stem. The effect is that the sap is immedi- 
ately impelled into the two buds next below the cluster, which soon 
push strongly and produce another cluster of flowers each. When 
these are visible the branch on which they belong is also topped 
down to their level, and this is done five times successively. By 
this means the plants become stout dwarf bushes about eighteen 
inches high. In order to prevent their falling over, sticks or strings 
are stretched horizontally along the rows so as to keep the plants 
erect. In addition to this all laterals whatsoever are nipped off. 
In this way the ripe sap is directed into the fruit, which acquires a 
beauty, size and excellence that is unattainable by other means.

TOMATO FIGS PBESEBYED. 



No. 1597.— The Fig or Bed Pear Tomato, as described in No. 
1553, is one of the very best varieties for preserving. Dip them in 
boiling water and peel them, being carefal not to injure them. 
Put five pounds of the Tomatoes in an earthen jar with five pounds 
of crushed cube sugar, then cover them and set them in a cool dry- 
place for two or three days. Then drain the juice into a copper 
basin, set it on the fire to boil, skim it well and, when clear of all 
the scum, let the syrup cool and then pour it over the Tomatoes. 
Eepeat this operation three times in one week. After this, when 
the weather is favorable, take the Tomatoes out of the jar and place 
them on dishes or plates in the sun to dry for about six or seven 
days, occasionally turning them over, and when they are dried put 
them in boxes lined with white paper. Sprinkle some powdered 
sugar ov^r them, then put another layer of Tomatoes (not too close 
together), then powdered sugar again, then Tomatoes, and continue 
this until the box is full. Cover them and keep them in a dry 
place.

chestnut trees, but do not thrive well in thick woods. They are 
found fromf two inches' to one foot below the soil. They have 
neither roots nor stems, and vary in color from white to light brown 
and black. They are somewhat globular in form and vary in size. 
Their surface is knotty or warty, and is covered with a skin or net- 
work which resembles veins. When they have attained their full 
growth they diffuse an agreeable odor which is quite peculiar. The 
flesh is solid and has a delicious taste, but when the Truffles are 
exposed for a few days they begin to decay and become bitter and 
disagreeable. They are put up in cans and bottles and can be ob- 
tained from all first-class grocers. But when canned they have lit- 
tle of the fine flavor and good qualities of the Truffle in its fresh 
state. They are used principally for stuffing turkeys, capons, 
and with goose-liver pates, etc. They have always been held 
in high esteem by epicures, and, owing to their rarity, have 
always commanded a high price. French Truffles can occa- 
sionally be obtained in New York from the stewards on Atlantic 
steamers, but the majority of those used in the United States are 
preserved, and the best brands can only be obtained from respon- 
sible importers. The district of Perigord in France furnishes the 
best flavored Truffles, which are of a black color. In the other 
parts of France they are grayish in color. The Italian Truffles from 
Piedmont are of a whitish color and have an excellent flavor. Truf- 
fles have not yet been found in the United States, akhough tubers 
that resemble them have been discovered in California, but it has 
not been accurately determined whether they are genuine Truffles 
or not. The following recipes are for canned Truffles.

TURNIP. 

NaveU Biibe. 

No. 1616. — The Turnip is a hardy biennial plant, and has been 
cultivated from time immemorial. The roots of all the varieties 
attain their full size during the first year. It is most easily affected 
in its form and flavor by soil, climate, and mode of culture. There 
are a great many varieties. It is a wholesome and agreeable 
vegetable. 

CULTURE. 

No. 1617. — Sow in drills fourteen inches apart, and half an inch 
deep. Keep them perfectly free from weeds and, when the bottoms 
begin to enlarge brush away the earth from about the roots to the 
depth of half an inch or more, and give them a light dressing of 
wood ashes. It is the surest mode of obtaining fair and smooth 
turnips in old gardens, where they are almost certain to grow wormy 
if the earth is allowed to remain in contact with the roots. For the 
spring and summer crops it is important to get them started very 
early, so that they may have time to grow to a sufficient size before 
hot weather, when they will soon become tough and strong. 

For the fall crop sow in the Middle and Western States in the lat- 
ter part of July and August, as directed for the spring sowing.

No. 1652. — The Turnip-Cabbage, or Kohl-rabi, is a vegetable that 
is intermediate between the cabbage and the turnip, combining the 
flavor of both. The edible part is a turnip-shaped bulb that is 
formed by the swelling of the stem. For table use it should be cut 
when small, as it is then tender and delicate. When it attains its 
full size it becomes tough and stringy. 

CULTURE. 

No. 1653. — It is cultivated best by sowing the seeds in rows, 
from May to July. It is difiicult to transplant, hence it is best to 
sow the entire crop from seed, and thin it out as it stands.

in a flat saucepan close together^ in from four to six layers, season- 
ing each layer, and then moisten them with broth to cover. Put a. 
cover on them to keep them down in the pan. Then put them on 
the fire and let them cook until the broth is reduced, and they will 
be thoroughly cooked. 

Prepare separately a Bice Bissoti, as in No. 1299, keeping it 
firmer, and add to it six ounces of butter and grated Parmesaa 
cheese. 

Butter a Timbal mould, line it with the cabbage leaves, and put 
a layer of the rice around the sides and bottom about one-quarter 
of an inch thick. Now put in a layer of the balls and sprinkle them 
with some grated Parmesan cheese, and a Uttle reduced Tomato- 
sauce. Continue doing this until the mould is full. Cover it with 
a layer of rice, with cabbage leaves over it, and place some thia

VEGETABLE BOBDERS. 

No. 1674. — ^To make vegetable borders the larger vegetables must 
first be cut with a spoon or column cutter, in any desired shape* 
Those generally used are Carrots, Turnips, Artichoke bottoms. 
Green Peas, String Beans, Brussels Sprouts, Flageolet Beans, and 
the flower buds of Cauliflower. The Carrots, Turnips and Arti- 
chokes are first parboiled, then cooked in broth seasoned with salt 
and a pinch of sugar. The other vegetables are boiled in plain 
water lightly salted, then immersed in cold water, so they will re^ 
tain their color. Then drain and dry them on a napkin. Care must 
be taken when cooking vegetables for borders not to have them 
underdone. 

Butter the mould lightly with clarified butter, and set it in a pan 
in which you have some broken ice. Dip the vegetables desired for 
the border in clarified butter, and place them against the mould in 
whatever design you like, alternating them in color. When the 
butter gets cold the vegetables will adhere to the side of the mould. 
When the border is finished cover it with a layer of forced meat of 
chicken, being careful not to disarrange the design, and to have the 
layers of equal thickness. Then fill the mould with a vegetable 
garniture, to which add a reduced Allemande or Cream sauce. 
Cover it with a forced meat of chicken, and smooth it nicely. On 
this put a buttered paper cover, and poach it for tweniy minutes.

When it is ready to serve place a napkin on a saucepan cover, and 
turn the fliould on to this napkin. Let it set for a little while to 
drain off the moisture. Then turn the mould on to the dish the 
border is intended to be served on^ and carefully remove the mould. 

RoTE.~Thi« border may be filled with potatoes, or any kind of vegetable puree. Other Borden 
can be prepared with a puree of yegetablee, eooh as oelery» green peas, spinach, and chestnuts, re- 
ducing the purees well. When they get a little cooled add the yolks of raw eggs, mix them well to- 
gether, and then All the moulds with the puree. Then poach them and proceed as explained above . 

CHABTBEUSE. 

No. 1675. — Chartreuse is o^e of the finest and most elaborate of 
all vegetable entrees. Young vegetables should be obtained, if 
possible; and they must be prepared with care, and in a tasteful 
manner. Those that are used to ornament the mould should con- 
sist only of such as will not los6 their color in cooking, as their 
fresh and bright appearance is what gives the fine effect to the 
entree. 

Wash and scrape some nice young red carrots, and cut them in 
pieces two inches long. With a column cutter cut out as many red 
pieces as possible, having them one-quarter of an inch in diameter. 
Put them in a basin of cold water as you cut them. 

Now prepare an equal quantity of turnips in the same manner. 
When they are both ready, parboil them separately in lightly-salted 
water; then immerse them in cold water, and drain them. Put them 
in separate saucepans, cover each with suflScient white broth to 
cook them; add a pinch of sugar, and let them cook slowly until 
tender, when the broth will be reduced. Put napkins on two plates; 
place the carrots on one plate and the turnips on the other; cover 
each with a napkin, and set them aside to get cold. (Some of the 
carrots may be cut in squares or in diamond shape if desired.) 

While these are cooking, make a vegetable essence of the carrot 
trimmings, a few turnips, a head of celery cut in small pieces, a few 
parsley roots, and two onions, in each of which stick four cloves. 
Put them in a saucepan with three pints of white broth, and as 
soon as it commences to boil, skim it well, and then let it boil 
slowly until the vegetables are thoroughly cooked. Strain the 
broth through a napkin, and reduce it with four spoonfuls of Espag- 
nole sauce to its proper consistency. 

While these are cooking, prepare the following: Cut one head 
of cabbage in quarters; remove the stalk and hard ribs, and par- 
boil the cabbage for four minutes. Then drain it, and tie each 
piece together. Put the pieces in a saucepan lined with thin slices 
of fat pork, and in the centre put a piece of trimmed and parboiled 
bacon and two sausages, on top of which lay one dressed partridge 
or four larded quails. Season with salt, pepper and a little nut-

meg, and add a faggot of parsley garnished. Cover it with thin 
slices of fat pork, and moisten it with sufficient broth to cover it. 
Now put on the cover, let it cook slowly until thoroughly cooked, 
and then drain it in a colander. 

While the above is cooking, butter a large Timbal mould, and 
decorate the sides and bottom with the pieces of turnips and car- 
rots, placing them side by side, alternating the colors, and arrang- 
ing them in some nice design. Put the mould in a cool place to 
•tillow the butter to harden and keep the vegetables in their proper 
positions. When the 'mould is prepared, put the drained cabbage 
in a napkin, and press out all of the moisture; cut the bacon and 
sausage in slices, and carve the partridge or quails. Put a layer of 
the cabbage on the bottom and around the sides. Now put a layer 
of bacon on top of the cabbage, then a layer of sausage, and then 
a layer of partridge or quail, and continue doing this until the 
mould is full, having a layer of cabbage on the top. Put a buttered 
paper cover over it. Now place the mould in a saucepan in which 
there is sufficient water to come half way up to the top of the 
motdd. (Be careful not to get any water in the mould.) Set it in 
a moderate oven to cook for three-quarters of an hour. 

Ten minutes before serving, put a napkin on a saucepan-cover 
and place the mould on it with the top down so that the moisture 
will drain oflf. When ready to serve place the mould on a dish and 
carefully remove the mould that surrounds the vegetables. Then 
pour over it the sauce with the essence of vegetables.

Chartreuse Is sometimes ornamented with green peas, asparagus tops and string beans by Inexper-

and when they are remoTsd from the mould thay will be unrecognisable and their beautifnl effect 
win be spoilt.

ESSENCE OF VEGETABLES. 

No. 1696. — Put the following in a saucepan: One shin of beef, 
one of veal, one hen, six carrots, six onions and two turnips. Pour 
two gallons of cold water over them and, when it boils, skim it 
well. Then add two heads of celery, a faggot of parsley garnished 
with two heads of lettuce, two leeks, some whole peppers and a few 
cloves. Now let it cook slowly for four hours, then strain it through 
a towel and reduce it on the fire to half of its quantity. 

FRYING BATTER FOR VEGETABLES. 

No. 1697. — Put two pounds of sifted flour in an earthen bowl, 
make a hollow in the centre, and add four ounces of melted butter 
and water enough to make a light batter. Mix it well and see that 
no lumps form, having it nice and smooth, and add a little salt. 
This batter should be made one hour before it is used. When ready 
to use it, beat the whites of four eggs into a stiff froth, and add 
them to the batter, mixing the whole gently. 

VEGETABLE SALADS. 

No. 1698. — ^All vegetables that can be eaten raw or cooked can be 
used in salads. They are seasoned with salt, pepper, oil and vine- 
gar, and are generally eaten cold. Various salad dressings and 
herbs are sometimes used in their preparation. Salads should vary 
according to the season of the vegetables. Care should be taken 
not to bruise any of the vegetables used in a salad. Green salads 
make a refreshing breakfast dish. Endives and dandelion should 
be dressed with a plain dressing and a piece of bread rubbed with 
garlic should always be added. The corn-salad or lamb-lettuce 
makes a delicious salad, dressed with pickled beets. A mustard 
dressing should be added to celery, and a few drops of Worcester- 
shire sauce also, to heighten the flavor if desired. Water-cress 
should be served fresh and plain. It is excellent with roasted or 
broiled fowl. Lettuce and cos lettuce are two popular salads. Do 
not dress it until ready to serve. Fine herbs may be added, and 
also a garniture of hard-boiled eggs. Mixed vegetable salads are 
best in spring, when the vegetables are young and tender. In mix- 
ing them see that they harmonize in taste and color. The best 
vegetables for salads are green and white beans, new or pickled 
beets, potatoes, small onions, carrots, artichoke bottoms, asparagus 
tops, green peas, and gherkins. Occasionally some anchovies, 
pickled herrings, capers, olives, truffles, and yolks of eggs may be 
added. Be very careful in seasoning salads. Always season with

the oil first, because if too much vinegar is used it will settle in the 
bottom of the salad bowl, instead of mixing with the oil properly. 
Never try to mix the salt with the vinegar. It is best to sprinkle 
it over the salad with the pepper^ or it can be mixed with the oil. 
Green salads are used at breakfast or dinner, while the salads that 
are made of fowl or fish are best at a luncheon, supper, or collation. 
Cucumbers and tomatoes can be served with the fish. 

Recipes for making the various kinds of sauces for salads will be

HOW TO PREPARE MOULDS WITH ASPIC JELLY, FOR SALADS. 

No. 1709. — The salads following this recipe are different from the 
foregoing, being made in moulds, and dressed on stands or borders, 
or on bread masked with butter for a relief and as a convenience in 
garnishing. They are used principally at balls and banquets, and 
when nicely executed they form a handsome ornament to a table. 
Much depends upon the proficiency of the party making them; and 
special care should be taken to have the Aspic jelly clear, and not. 
too firm. In cold weather it need not be as solid as when the 
weather is warm. They may be made in Charlotte or Timbal moulds,, 
if desired; but it is best to use the regular Salad moulds that are 
made expressly for this purpose. They contain a false mould, 
which is inserted after the mould is ornamented. The space around 
this false mould is filled with jelly, and allowed to become firm. 
Warm water is then put in the centre of the mould, so it can bo^ 
removed easily, which leaves the center vacant, to be filled with the^ 
salad. Then smooth off the top evenly, and set the mould aside to^ 
get cold until ready for use. Then dip the mould in warm water, 
wipe it dry, and then turn it out on the dish it is to be served on. 

The mould is prepared, arranged and decorated as follows : Put 
the mould in a pan containing some cracked ice, and let it get cold. 
Put some cool Aspic jelly in the mould, and turn the mould around 
constantly until it is thinly and evenly coated with the jelly on the 
sides and bottom. (It takes considerable practice to do this per- 
fectly.) Drain your vegetables, and dry them well on a napkin. 
Dip each piece separately in a cool Aspic jelly, and arrange them 
in the bottom and around the sides of the mould in the design that 
you prefer, alternating the colors. When this is done, line it with 
another coating of jelly, set it aside to get cold, and then fill the 
centre with the prepared salad. Truffles, capers, olives and the 
whites of eggs can be used to decorate the mould, instead of vege- 
tables, if desired.

SCALY BABE. 

No. 1723. — ^A very popular variety in the South, which will keep 
in good condition after pickling longer than any other sort. The 
vines are large, with coarse foliage, the fruit large and oblong, and 
the flesh red and very tender. 

MOUNTAIN SWEET. 

No. 1724. — A large, long oval variety. The flesh is scarlet and 
quite solid to the center, very sweet and delicious. 

ICE CBEAM. 

No. 1725. — This is medium-sized. The flesh is scarlet and very 
sweet. A good variety for general culture. 

FEBRY'S PEERLESS. 

No. 1726. — The best melon for general use, particularly in the 
North. The vine is vigorous, hardy and productive. The fruit is 
medium, oval, and finely mottled with light and dark-green, some- 
what in stripes. The rind is thin, and the flesh bright scarlet, solid 
to the centre, crisp, nutty, and sweet. 

EARLY JEBSEY. 

No. 1727. — One of the earliest varieties, above the medium size, 
oval round, and light-green in color. The flesh is scarlet, solid, 
finely grained, very sweet and juicy. 

HOW TO SERVE MELONS. 

No. 1728. — Water-melons are served as a relish, or for dessert, 
and should be kept in a cool place for some time before 
serving. Out a piece from each end, and then cut the melon in a 
zig-zag shape in the centre, which will divide the melon in half, 
and set each half on a dish with a napkin. Place them on the table, 
and when ready to use, cut them in slices. 

Note.— Cat a ping out of the melon, pour a glass of brandy Inside, replace the plug,- keep the 
melon In a cool place, and occasionally turn it. In twenty-four hours the brandy will be absorbed, 
and the melon ready to serre. This makes a delicious change from the ordinary way of eating 
melons.

Froment, Weitzen, 

No. 1729. — Wheat is a plant of the genus Triticum. The seed of 
this plant furnishes a white flour for bread and, next to rice, is tho 
grain most generally used by the human race. The varieties are 
numerous, comprising the Summer and Winter Wheat, the Bearded 
Wheat, the White Wheat and the Bald Wheat. The Summer and 
Winter Wheat furnishes most of the grain that is used for food.

No. 1730. — This is a cross between the old Diehl and the Bed 
TMEediterranean, having the fine flavoring quality and bearded head of 
the latter and the close compact head of the former. It is a vigor- 
ous grower and is well adapted to light soil. The heads are some- 
what club-shaped, short, but very compact, and are squarely filled 
out at both ends, containing about sixteen breasts of from three to 
four kernels each. The berry is of a bright amber color, of medium 
size and very handsome. 

VALLEY. 

No. 1731. — This variety originated in Ohio and yields enormously, 
but needs rich ground and good cultivation. The heads are bearded,

ternels each. The berry is long and hard, and of an amber color. 

martin's amber. 

No. 1732. — A hybrid variety that originated in the eastern part 
•of Pennsylvania. While young, the plants lie spread out over the 
ground, affording a good protection to their own roots. The straw 
is tall and very stiff, standing up better than most varieties. The 
leaves are dark green and quite free from rust. It has a large, 
bald, smooth, well-filled head, containing from sixteen to eighteen 
breasts, and is rather late in ripening. The berry is of a light 
Amber color, good size and very plump and handsome. It has a

PREFACE. 



'' What ! " the reader may exclaim "Another book on cookery ! 
Have we not Careme and Francatelli, Yatel and Soyer, Ude and 
Gouffe, Miss Acton and Mrs. Beeton, Meg Dodds and Mrs. Hale, 
and scores of other authorities on the same subject ? Must every 
cook be an author, and we be asked to read his book, as well as to 
eat of the dishes he prepares?" Gentle reader, it is to anticipate 
this possible state of mind, and to answer these probable questions, 
that this explanatory preface is submitted. Many a dish is cooked 
that is not worth the time and trouble, even by an ordinarily edu- 
cated palate, given to its discussion, and many a book written 
especially on the subject of Cookery the reading of which is worse 
than time wasted. There have been innumerable Cook Books for 
popular use published, I grant you ; but if you ask nine out of ten 
persons who consult them, they will tell you they become more 
and more perplexed as they attempt to follow their guidance. 
The housekeeper will confess she has been led into errors by their 
vague recipes, injurious to the family health, and, at the same time, 
expensive to the family purse. It is to dissipate this fog enveloping 
the literature of the kitchen that the publication of the BOOK OF 
AMERICAN PRACTICAL COOKERY is undertaken. The author claims 
that the work is the result of a lifetime of study, constant observa- 
tion, and practical experience in the best culinary establishments 
of both Continents. He, therefore, brings to his task a thorough 
knowledge of the subject, and asserts, fearless of successful contra- 
diction, that the result of his labors will be the only competent, 
treatise applying culinary science especially to the material condi- 
tions of this country ever written. He intends it for a trustworthy 
guide to all what to eat and drink, and what to avoid. 



VI PKEFACE. 

In pursuance of the plan laid down, lie proposes to embrace 
the whole list of food articles, their selection, treatment, and best 
method of preparing them for the table, showing how the utmost 
value can be obtained from every edible designed by the Almighty 
for the comfort and nourishment of mankind. It is due to the 
intelligence of the present age that there should no longer be room 
for the old sneer of the dyspeptic cynic: " God sends the material,, 
but the Devil sends cooks." 

To accomplish this important object will require at least six 
volumes. Marie Antoine Careme, the great French cook, who lived 
between the years 1784 and 1833, and who was called the "regen- 
erator of cookery," took twelve volumes to give Europe of his day 
the information which the author of the present series proposes to 
give America of the present, in six. Each volume of the AMERICAN 
PRACTICAL COOKERY series will be devoted to a leading food staple. 
This, the first volume, deals with vegetables and all alimentary 
plants, roots, and seeds grown on the American continent, with full 
remarks of the best varieties, their mode of cultivation, cooking, 
dishing, and other matters of interest connected with this branch of 
the culinary art one, by the w r ay, of no small importance, but to 
which generally scant attention is paid by the household, and even 
by the club and hotel, cook. 

It comes quite in place here to give a few cursory hints on the 
subject-matter more definitely and precisely stated in the body of 
this volume. In preparing all alimentary plants for the table, the 
best, freshest, and those in season, should always be chosen. Stale 
or decayed vegetables, or those that have been overheated in pack- 
ing, or bruised in transportation, are unwholesome. Avoid them 
if you value your health. Preserved vegetables should not be used 
for the table, if they can be possibly declined. Where their use 
cannot be avoided, be careful to select those put up at creditable 
establishments, with the name of the proprietor or company, and 
the quality of the goods marked plainly on the package. Often 
flashy and picturesque labels conceal germs of disease, in the shape 
of imperfectly preserved vegetables, sufficient to cause an epidemic. 
Vegetables should only be freely eaten in the spring, because most 
kinds are then seasonable, and consequently wholesome and nutri- 
tious. Some of the few fall varieties are improved by light frosts. 



PKEFACE. yii 

Vegetables forced in hot-houses are not as good as those grown in 
the open air, and subjected to ordinary natural conditions. The 
variety of climate with which the United States is blessed, promotes 
the growth of every variety of fruit and vegetable known in the 
world, and the facilities for transportation put nearly every section 
of our country on the same footing, so far as the enjoyment at their 
best of the products of each is concerned. 

In cooking vegetables, good pure water is essential. To cook 
green vegetables properly, they should be put into a vessel while 
the water, is boiling the pot remaining uncovered. By this means 
they will retain their natural color. Vegetables can be served with 
each course, or alone, before or after the roast. It is better that 
they precede the roast, as the appetite is thereby improved for the 
course that follows. Too many vegetables should not be served 
with a dinner. They ought to be selected with care according to 
the course they accompany. These hints, although general, will 
serve a good purpose in awakening attention. 

In conclusion, the author may, without egotism, again state, that 
he feels confident in his ability to make this series on AMERICAN 
PRACTICAL COOKERY a standard work, because he is practically 
acquainted with the details of every branch on which he writes, 
and, at the same time, familiar with the broader requirements of 
the culinary profession. A chief cook, besides being versed in the 
technique of the kitchen, should also be a good judge of the kinds, 
qualities and uses of every dietetic article. As the old Greek comic 
poet Dionysius, says: 

" To roast some beef, to carve with neatness, 
To blow up sauces, and to blow the fire, 
Is anybody's task; he who does this 
Is but a seasoner and a broth-maker. 
A cook is quite another thing. His mind 
Must comprehend all facts and circumstances, 
Where is the place, and what the time of supper, 
Who are the guests, and who the entertainer, 
What fish he ought to buy, and where he ought to buy it," etc. 

The author does not expect to realize a fortune by this publica- 
tion. The work is, in a degree, a labor of love, prompted as much 
by a desire to benefit the culinary art, as by any other feeling. But 



Till PREFACE. 

though his reward may not reach the munificent one of Antony's 
cook, who received a city for his skill in arranging a Cleopatra ban- 
quet, he feels assured at least of the gratitude of all those who wish 
to intelligently enjoy the pleasures of the table, and of the hearty 
appreciation of his fellow-workers in the important field of culinary 

science.

NOTE. 



By The entire work on "AMERICAN PRACTICAL COOKERY," now in course of preparation by Mr. 
Harder, will consist of six volumes, each devoted to a particular article of food soups, fish, flesh, 
fowl, farinace, sauces, conserves, liqueurs, &c. and each treated in the same thoroughly exhaustive 
manner exemplified in this, the first of the series. Prefixed, is a glossary of such technical terms 
and phrases as occur in the text of this volume, and which the general reader may have need to 
consult. A copious index will also facilitate reference to the different details of the subjects treated. 
Due notice will be given of the appearance of Volume II of the series.

GLOSSARY 



-OF- 



WORDS AND TERMS USED IN THIS BOOK. 



Allemande. Allemande sauce is not of German origin, as the name 
would imply, but is the mother and stock of the white French 
sauces. It is made with veal and chicken broth, and is then called 
Veloute'e. After this the yolks of eggs, lemon juice, and essence 
of mushrooms are added. It is fully described in the " Book 
on Sauces." When this sauce can not be made conveniently a 
substitute can be made by thickening a veal or chicken broth, 
the same as for butter sauce, letting it boil for fifteen minutes. 
Put the yolks of four raw eggs in a saucepan with four spoon- 
fuls of cream, and mix in slowly one quart of the thickened 
veal or chicken sauce. Add the juice of one lemon, season 
with salt, pepper, and nutmeg, and set it on the fire. Stir it 
continually until it boils, then strain it through a sauce towel. 
Put it in a saucepan and place small pieces of butter on top to 
prevent a crust from forming. 

Annual. Annual plants are those that must be sown every year. 

Aroma. The quality or principle of plants or seeds that constitutes 
their fragrance. An agreeable odor. 

Aromatic. A plant characterized by a pleasant smell, and usually 
by a warm, pungent taste. 

Bain-marie. Literally a hot water bath. A Bain-marie is a square 
pan in which hot water is kept, and is used to keep saucepans 
in that contain sauces or stews, that are to be kept warm before 
serving. The water must be kept almost at the boiling heat, 
but never allowed to boil. The name Bain-marie is also applied 
to the high saucepans that are made expressly to sit in the 
above mentioned Bain-marie pans. 

Biennial. Biennial plants are those that last for two years and then 
perish. 

Blanch. To whiten the stalks or leaves of a plant by earthing them 
up or tying them together to exclude the light. 



XX GLOSSARY. 

Braise. To cook or stew in a close-covered saucepan or other vessel 
on a slow fire. Formerly hot coals were put on the cover to 
keep the heat even, but an oven is much better and warms the 
vessel thoroughly. 

Brisk Fire. One burning with a quick, free action. 

Batter. When the expression "add apiece of butter" is used, it 
depends on the quantity of vegetables cooked. For four per- 
sons, add a piece as large as a walnut. For soups, add from 
four to six ounces. When it is added, toss the vegetables well 
over until the butter is melted. In soups, keep stirring until 
the butter is melted. In this way it thoroughly permeates the 
article being cooked, and gives it a glossy, velvety appearance. 
If it is not stirred, it will remain on the top and impart a greasy 
appearance to the food. 

Calyx. The outer covering of a flower. 
Capsule. The seed vessel of a plant. 

Catechu. A dry, brown, astringent extract, obtained by decoction 
and evaporation from the Acacia Catechu, in India. It contains

table tissues. It is convertible into starch and sugar. 

Chopped. The term "chopped" parsley or onions is used often. 
Before being chopped, parsley must be washed, then dried in a 
towel; the large stems must be removed, and then the leaves 
are chopped. Then put it in a towel and wring out the moist- 
ure; after this dip it in boiling water for a minute, then immerse 
it in cold water and squeeze it dry. By doing this it will retain 
. its green color in cooking. Onions should not be chopped or 
they will turn black; they should be cut finely. Parboiled 
vegetables, such as spinach or cabbage, should be drained first 
and then dried before being chopped on a board. Garlic has 
a stronger flavor when mashed than when chopped. 

Clarify. To make clear. Applied principally to butter, which 
should be melted over a slow fire and then strained through a 
napkin. 

Coagulate. To curdle or thicken; to change from a liquid to a solid 
mass.

into in sowing. 

Esculent. Any plant that is fit for food, though sometimes used as 
a general name for edible roots. 

Espagnole Sauce. This is the stock sauce of almost all of the brown 
sauces. It is made of good stock broth, thickened with cooked 
flour, and then flavored. It is fully described in the "Book on 
Sauces." When this sauce cannot be made conveniently, an 
ordinary brown sauce can be substituted, which is made as fol- 
lows: Make an ordinary stock broth; then thicken, and flavor 
it lightly with ham, vegetables and Madeira wine. When done 
it must be free from grease. 

Expression. The act of pressing or squeezing out. 

Faggot. A term applied to a bunch of vegetables and herbs that

French ANGELICA. German 

Angelique. Angelika 

No. 5. Is is a hardy biennial aromatic plant, and is said to have 
originated in Syria, where it grows along the banks of rivers near 
high mountains. It is cultivated in the United States but is of in- 
ferior quality. The plant is highly esteemed in its preserved state, 
and much used by pastry cooks and confectioners. The best An- 
gelica now preserved comes from Niort, where the old formula is 
adhered to, as when made by the Nuns of the " Visitation of St. 
Mary," which gave it a world-wide reputation. The tender leaf- 
stalks and flavoring shoots of the native grown Angelica are used 
as a basis for sweet-meats, and the seeds for flavoring liquors. 

CULTURE. 

No. 6. The plants thrive best in damp localities, but may be 
grown in well enriched soil. Sow in drills, ten inches apart. Allow 
the young plants to remain until the following spring, then set them 
out two feet asunder, in each direction. The stalk, which is a 
cylindrical, hollow, herbaceous stem, will be fit for use by June of 
the following year. If the flower stem is removed, as it makes its 
appearance, the plants will put forth fresh sprouts from the sides 
of the root, and survive three years, but when allowed to blossom 
and perfect their seeds the plants soon perish. 

ANGELICA SYRUP. 

No. 7. Trim one pound Angelica stems, parboil them for ten 
minutes, then immerse them in cold water. Peel and dry them on 
a napkin, cut in small pieces, put in a glass jar with two quarts of 
Spirits of Wine, at fifty degrees; cover, and let stand for ten days. 
Then add a half pint of syrup, at thirty degrees. Filter the next 
day, put it in a bottle and cork well. 

PRESERVED OR CANDIED ANGELICA. 

No. 8. Cut the Angelica in stems twelve inches long, then throw 
them into boiling water, letting them boil twenty minutes, then 
immerse them into cold water. Peel and dry them on a napkin, and 
when all are prepared put them into an earthen bowl. Make a syrup 
with five pounds of sugar to five pounds of water. Pour it over the 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE. * 3 

Angelica boiling hot, and cover. Next day draw off the syrup, 
make it boil again, skimming it well, and pour over the Angelica 
again. Repeat this four times in all, and the fifth time let the 
syrup cook to a boil, then add the Angelica, letting it cook until it 
gets firm. Then take out one piece at a time and put them in a 
warm place to dry. 



IV. 



French ANISE. German 

Anis. Anis. 

No. 9. Is an annual aromatic plant, and is cultivated for its 
seeds and leaves, which are used for seasoning and flavoring. The 
seeds have a fragrant odor, a pleasant warm taste, and are used by 
confectioners and bakers, and also for medicinal purposes in 
cases of dyspepsia and colic, and to correct griping when taking 
unpleasant medicine. The green leaves are used like fennel for sea- 
soning and garnishing salads. 

ANISETTE CORDIAL. 

No. 10. A liquor distilled from anise seeds. The most renowned 
comes from Amsterdam, and is partaken after dinner with black 
coffee, and is also used for creams, jellies and punches. 

PUMPERNICKEL. 

No. 11. A kind of bread made in Germany called pumpernickel, 
in which anise seeds are mixed, and much relished when eaten 
with stewed prunes, figs or pears. 

CULTURE. 

No. 12. Sow in warm mellow or garden soil early in spring in 
drills ten inches apart and one inch deep. When the plants are 
about an inch high, thin to four inches apart and keep the ground 
between the rows loose and free from weeds. When the seeds are 
ripened the plants should be pulled up and spread in a sunny place 
to dry. Then thresh the seeds from the heads, riddle and winnow 
them and again expose to the sun to evaporate any remaining 
moisture.

French German 

Planie Medicinal, Aromatique et herbe. Medizinishe Aromatishe, Griiuter. 

No. 13. Care should be taken to harvest them properly. This 
should be done on a. dry day just before they come into full bloom. 
Then dry them and pack closely entirely excluded from the air. 
They are used for culinary and medicinal purposes. For further 
information see each under its classification. 



CULTURE. 

No. 14. Most of the varieties thrive best in rich sandy soil, 
which should be carefully prepared and well cultivated, as the 
young plants are for the most part delicate, and are easily choked 
out by weeds. Sow as early as the ground can be made ready, in 
drills sixteen inches apart, or they may be planted as a second 
crop, the seeds sown in beds in April and the plants set out in 
June.

ALLSPICE OR AROMATIC NIGELLE. 

French tcrinan 

Piment ou Quartre Epices. Piment. 

No. 16. Is a hardy annual plant from the East Indies. It is 
cultivated for its seeds, which are produced in a roundish capsule 
and are somewhat triangular, wrinkled, of a yellowish color, and 
have a pungent, aromatic taste. There are species cultivated, the 
seeds of which are black. The seeds have a warm, aromatic taste, 
and are used in. the kitchen under the name of allspice 9r the four 
spices. 

CULTURE. 

No. 17. Sow in April, in light, warm soil, in drills fourteen 
inches apart and half an inch deep. When the plants are two 
inches high thin them to six inches apart in the rows, keeping the 
soil loose and watering occasionally, if the weather is dry. When 
the seed ripens cut off the plants at the roots, and spread them in an 
airy situation to dry. When dried thresh out, after which spread 
out the seeds again for a short time to evaporate any remaining 
moisture, when they will be ready for use.

ARTICLE: VII. 



French ARTICHOKE. German 

Artichaut. Artishoke. 

No. 18. Artichokes were first discovered in Italy, but are now 
planted in all large gardens in the United States, and are used as 
a vegetable, and prepared for the table in various ways. There are 
five kinds of Artichokes, viz : The Yiolet, the White, the Green, 
the Red, and the Sweet. They are called the Globe Artichokes, 
which differ from the Jerusalem Artichoke. The Sweet Artichoke 
is preferable to all others for its delicious flavor. It grows very 
small, and its plants are very productive for two years. It is rare 
yet in this country. .The Green, which is the variety in general 
use, is large and juicy. The Bed, which is more delicate than the 
Green, is picked when young, and is mostly used for eating in the 
raw state, or in salad. The Violet grows as large as the Green, but 
is not as profitable in culture. The White is very productive, but 
very troublesome to raise, and owing to this is very rare in the 
market. 

Artichokes when eaten raw take long to digest, but when cooked 
are very agreeable. They are cooked in various ways as a vegetable 
for the table, and are used for garnitures and soups. 

CULTURE. 

No. 19. Sow in April in rich soil, and transplant the following 
spring to permanent beds, in rows or drills, three feet apart and 
two feet between the plants. The first season will only give a par- 
tial crop, but as it is a perennial, after being once planted the beds 
will remain in bearing for years. They should be protected in 
winter by a covering of leaves or coarse manure. 

GREEN LARGE GLOBE. 

No. 20. Is the best for general culture and use. The edible 
portion is the undeveloped flower heads, which should be used be- 
fore they begin to open, and the stalk should then be cut to the 
ground, for if the flowers expand they weaken the plant. In the 
large Globe the buds are large nearly round; scales deep green, 
shading to purple, very thick and fleshy, the bottom of which is the 
edible part. 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE. 7 

HOW TO PREPARE ARTICHOKES FOR COOKING. 

No. 21. Do not use Artichokes when they have developed. If 
once open they are not good for cooking. Cut off the stem, trim 
off the hard leaves around the bottom, and cut off the upper quarter 
of the Artichoke leaves. Then scoop out the fibrous part in the 
middle and put them in a pan of cold water acidulated. When thus 
prepared put them in boiling water, add a little salt and lemon 
juice, and cook until tender. When done drain them OD a napkin. 

ARTICHOKES WITH HOLLANDAISE SAUCE. 

No. 22. Prepare one dozen Artichokes as in No. 21. Then put 
them in boiling water with a little salt and the juice of two lemons, 
cover the saucepan and let them boil for twenty-five minutes on a 
brisk fire. When ready to serve drain them on a napkin, upside 
down, so as to absorb all the moisture from them, then dish them 
up on a napkin, and serve the Hollaudaiss Sauce separately.

FOB RELISH OB SIDE DISH. 

No. 25. The small tender ones are served raw, after being 
cleaned of the fibrous parts and dished up on a napkin. The large 
ones are cut into quarters, trimmed of the hard leaves. Removing 
all the fibrous parts, keep them in cold water, in which add a little 
vinegar. Serve them in a relish dish, adding the juice of lemons 
which will keep the artichokes from turning black. Serve the sauce 
separately in a sauce bowl. 

ARTICHOKES, WITH OIL AND VINEGAR SAUCE. 

No. 26. Take the yolks of two hard boiled eggs, mash them

French ASPARAGUS. German 

Asperge. Spar gel. 

No. 65. The Asparagus is one of the best table vegetables, 
having a delicious flavor, and being easily prepared. It can be 
had nearly all the year round, but is best when in season. To have 
them at perfection they need great care in their cultivation. The 
best flavored and most tender are those raised under cover and kept 
from the rays of the sun. There are four varieties: the green, 
violet, white and wild Asparagus. The white is savory and agree- 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OP TASTE. 19 

able for eating whole, but contains little substance. The violet 
grows large and is very substantial and preferred by all gourmets. 
The green is smaller and more common and is generally used for 
soups and purees. The wild is used for medical purposes. The 
water in which Asparagus has been boiled, when cold, is a refresh- 
ing drink, and can be used to advantage by persons troubled with 
kidney complaint. 

CULTUEE 

No. 66. Sow early in spring, as soon as the ground will admit 
of working, in rows a foot apart. Keep carefully hoed and clear 
from weeds, and the plant will be in condition to set out in the suc- 
ceeding spring. The soil for the permanent beds should be thor- 
oughly manured and trenched or plowed to a depth of at least one 
foot. Plant in rows, spread the roots well out and let the crown of 
the plant be set deep enough so that it will be covered from five to 
eight inches. In heavy soil the covering must be less than in 
light soil. After sowing the seeds, tread them firmly in with the feet. 

COLOSSAL. 

No. 67. The best variety, unrivaled in size, deep green in color, 
tender and good in quality. 

GIANT. 

No. 68. A popular variety, producing green and purple shoots, 
according to the soil. It grows very hardy but not as large as v the 
Colossal. 

CROSSBRED. 

No. 69. It retains the head closed until the stalks are quite 
long and is of a uniform color, while for tenderness and quality it 
is unsurpassed. The size is medium large, and uniform, 

SMALL DEFIANCE. 

No. 70. Is of a rich green color, very early, good sized, tender, 
and good quality. 

HOW TO PREPARE ASPARAGUS FOR COOKING.

a knife and scrape the bottom parts of the stems. Put them in 
bundles of about ten to fifteen Asparagus in each and see that the 



20 HARDER'S AMERICAN COOKERY. 

heads are even. Tie them with a string and cut them at the bottom 
so as to have them all the same length. Boil them in boiling water 
with a little salt. Asparagus to be good should not be overdone, 
and in serving them when boiled, dish up on a napkin so that it 
will absorb all the moisture, with sauce separately. 

ASPARAGUS, WITH BUTTER SAUCE. 

No. 72. Prepare the Asparagus as in No. 71. Tie them in

Asparagus is cooking, make the following sauce : Put in a saucepan 
one-half pound of best fresh butter, add a little salt, pinch of mace 
and red pepper, the yolks of four raw eggs, the juice of two lemons 
and two soup spoons full of cold water. Put the saucepan in boil- 
ing water, stirring it with a whisk continually. As soon as it com- 
mences to thicken take it off the fire, place a layer of Asparagus on 
a dish, then a layer of the sauce twice over. This must be served 
hot; delay will spoil it. The Asparagus must be served with a 
spoon, and is eaten \jith the fork.

THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE. 25 

ASPARAGUS, PRESEEVED IN SALT. 

No. 93. Pick out middle sized, sound and fresh cut Asparagus, 
Put into the bottom of a square water-tight wooden box, which you 
intend filling, a layer of salt, then a layer of Asparagus, then a 
layer of salt, a layer of Asparagus, continuing until filled. On the 
top layer have the salt one-half an inch thick, and have a wooden 
cover to fit closely on the box, with a weight on top to keep it 
pressed down, and keep them in a cool dry place. When ready to 
use them soak them for three hours in cold water, then scrape them 
the ordinary way, and put them to soak in lukewarm water for five 
hours, changing the' water occasionally, then cook them as required. 

ASPARAGUS, PRESERVED IN CANS. 

No. 94. Square boxes, the size of the Asparagus, are much bet- 
ter than the round high boxes generally used by factories. When 
the boxes are properly made they can be used several times for the 
same purpose. Each box should contain from twenty-five to thirty 
Asparagus. After the Asparagus stems are scraped, wash them in 
cold water, tie them in bundles, and cut them all the same size. 
Parboil them for five minutes in water lightly salted, then immerse 
them in cold water, drain them and put on a linen towel to dry- 
Then arrange them in boxes so that the bottom half will have their 
heads towards the right, and the top half will have their heads to- 
wards the left. Cover them with cold boiled water, lightly salted; 
solder on the cover and boil the cans in a hot bath for one and one- 
half hours. 

ASPARAGUS TOPS, PRESERVED. 

No. 95. Use fresh green Asparagus, and all the same size. Cut 
off the heads and keep them separate. Then cut the remaining 
tender part the size of a large pea. Parboil the heads one minute 
and the others five minutes. Immerse them in cold water, then 
drain them and dry on a napkin. Mix them together and put them 
into round quart tin cans. Cover them with cold boiled water, 
lightly salted; solder on the cover and boil them in a hot water 
bath for one hour.

French ASPARAGUS BEAN. German 

Haricot Asperge. Spargel Bohne. 

No. 97. The Asparagus Bean is a distinct variety from the gar- 
den bean, being a native of the southern part of South America 
and China. The pods measure over one foot in length, and the 
beans are cultivated on account of their long pods, which are crisp 
and tender, having a rich flavor, and being much esteemed for 
pickling. The seeds are quite small, and are seldom eaten in their 
green or ripe state. 



ARTICLB xi. 



BALM. 

Baume. Melisse. 

No. 98. Balm is a hardy perennial aromatic plant. Originally 
from the southern part of Europe. The leaves have a fragrant 
odor, similar to lemons, and are used for making Balm Tea, for use 
in fever, and makes a pleasant beverage of Balm wine for diseases 
of the lungs, being also used in seasoning meats and for flavoring 
vinegar. A mixture of Balm and honey is sometimes applied to 
the interior of bee hives just previous to receiving the swarm for 
the purpose of their settlement, to attract them. 

CULTURE. 

No. 99. Prepare a rich sandy soil and keep it clear of weeds. 
Plant early and thin to ten inches apart. The plants will soon 
completely cover the ground, and the bed with good management 
will last several years. When drying, the plants should be cut as 
they come into bloom, separating the stems at the surface of the 
ground. Spread them in an airy shady place and allow them to dry 
gradually. The leaves may be used in their green state directly 
from the plants, as they are required. 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE. 27 



XII. 



French BALM MINT. German 

Melisse. Melisse. 

No. 100. The Balm Mint is a hardy perennial aromatic plant, 
similar to the Balm, but different in flavor, being often taken for 
Mint, on account of its flavor. It is used for seasoning game and 
flavoring vinegar and spirituous waters. Culture same as Balm. 



ARTICLB xi 1 1. 



BARLEY. 

Orge. Oerste. 

No. 101. The common Barley is a cereal, the flour obtained 
from its grains containing very little gluten, but an abundance of 
fecula, also containing a mucilaginous substance. For this reason 
it produces a bread less savory and less digestible than other flours. 
The Pearl Barley, when entirely removed of its pellicle, is reduced 
to a small pearl. It is much used for culinary purposes in replac- 
ing rice, and also in making soups for invalids. 

COMMON BARLEY. 

No. 102. Barley succeeds best in lands more sandy and lighter 
than those adapted to wheat. It is sown in the spring and can be 
grown further north than any other grain. Unless intended for 
seed, it should be cut before being fully ripe, as it is then heavier, 
of better quality, and less liable to shell. The land should always 
be rolled immediately after sowing. 

BARLEY MANSURY. 

No. 103. This is a six-rowed Barley with long, heavy well filled 
heads, containing large plump grains. The straw is bright, very 
strong, and is not apt to lodge even in the richest lands. Ripens 
a week later than the common six-rowed Barley, or about the same 
time as two-rowed Barley. 



28 HARDER'S AMERICAN COOKERY. 

BARLEY NAKED, OR HULLNESS. 

No. 104. This is a peculiar grain, and not generally known. 
The corolla is not attached to the grain, and in this it resembles 
wheat. It is a splendid grain for all the purposes for which Barley 
is used, and will make an excellent bread when bolted and ground 
like wheat. 

SOUPS. 

CREAM BARLEY, NEILSON STYLE. 

No. 105. Put in a saucepan half a pound of butter, and when 
melted add a handful of flour and four handfuls of Pearl Barley, 
stirring it with a wooden spoon for fifteen minutes. Then add in 
slowly one gallon of veal or chicken broth; make it boil, and then 
set on the side of the fire to boil slowly, adding a faggot of parsley 
garnished, with two leeks and two green onions. Season with salt 
and pepper, and let it boil slowly for an hour and a half. Then skim 
off the grease and take out the faggot. Strain it through a fine sieve 
and put back in saucepan to keep warm. When ready to serve add 
the following preparation: Take a pint of cream and the yolks of 
six raw eggs, mix them well, and strain through a strainer. Add six 
ounces of butter, stirring it well until the butter is melted. Serve 
with a garniture royal. 

CREAM BARLEY, MARIE LOUISE STYLE. 

No. 106. Prepare the soup same as No. 105. When moistened 
with the broth and it boils add two raw chickens, letting them boil 
slowly until they are cooked. Then take out the chickens and the 
faggot, skim off the grease and strain through a fine sieve. Season 
with salt and pepper and set on the fire to keep warm. Take the 
breasts of the chickens and pound them into a fine paste with six 
ounces of butter. Then rub it through a fine sieve and put it in a 
saucepan, adding a pint of cream, the yolks of six eggs and a pinch 
of sugar. Then add the hot soup slowly while stirring briskly with 
a whisk. Serve with a garniture of green peas. 

CREAM OP BARLEY, FARRAGUT STYLE. 

No. 107. Prepare the soup in a similar way to No. 105. When 
strained set it on the fire to keep warm, and when ready to serve 
add six ounces of crawfish butter, diluted in their broth, the yolks 
of six raw eggs and a glass of cream, stirring well until the butter 
is melted. Serve with a garniture of fried peas. 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE. 29 

BAELEY BROTH FOE INVALIDS. 

No. 108. Wash two handfuls of Pearl Barley in cold water. 
Put in a saucepan on the fire with three quarts of plain chicken 
broth, and let it boil slowly for two hours. Press the liquid through 
a fine sieve and season lightly. When common Barley is used for 
these recipes put on the fire with cold water, and as soon as it 
boils strain off and proceed as with Pearl Barley. 

BAELEY WATEE FOE INVALIDS. 

No. 109. Prepare same as No. 108. Use water instead of broth. 
When cooked press the liquid through a fine sieve. Serve plain or 
sweeten with sugar. 

BARLEY CREAM FOR INVALIDS. 

No. 110. Prepare the Barley as in No. 108. Use milk in place 
of broth. When well cooked press the liquid through a fine sieve 
and sweeten with a syrup of marsh mallow or venus hair. 

BAELEY WATEE FOE GAEGLING. 

No. 111. When Barley water is made for gargling with briar 
leaves and honey, use the plain common Barley without changing 
the fresh water as with No. 108. When the Barley water is made 
pour it boiling over the briar leaves, then add a soup spoonful of 
honey and one of wine vinegar. 



XIV. 



French BASIL SWEET. German 

Basilic. Basilikum. 

No. 112. There are four kinds of Basil. The large sweet Basil 
is the one principally used for culinary purposes. It is a hardy 
annual plant, and must be cut before it gets in full bloom. The 
seeds and stems are dried and used for flavoring soups and sauces, 
etc. It is also used when young and tender to mix with cooked 
vegetable salads, such as potatoes, beets, peas, beans, etc. 



30 HARDEE'S AMERICAN COOKERY. 

CULTURE. 

No. 113. All the varieties are annual and grow from seed. Sow 
as early as the ground will permit, in sandy soil carefully prepared. 
For winter use the stalks are cut while in flower, then dried, pow- 
dered and preserved as other pot herbs. 



xv. 



BAY LEAVES, OR LAUREL LEAVES (Common). 

French German 

Laurier Franc ou dappolon. Lorbeerblatt. 

No. 114. These leaves are much used for culinary purposes, be- 
ing indispensable for stews, etc.. For these purposes they should 
be used in their dry state, as they then lose their bitter taste. 
In their green state they are used for pickling, and in imparting 
an aromatic taste to meats. 



XVI. 



BAY OR LAUREL LEAVES (Larustine). 
Laurier Amande. Lorbeerblatt. 

No. 115. These are not used much for culinary purposes, but in 
dairies they are frequently used to aromatize the milk. They should 
be used with precaution. Although they give an agreeable taste 
to the milk they are dangerous to use, being slightly poisonous. 



XVII. 



BEANS. 

Haricot. Bohne. 

No. 116. This is a vegetable of which there are many varieties. 
They are prepared for the table in several different ways. Some 
varieties, when young and tender, are eaten whole, and are known 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE. 31 

as String Beans. Later on they get hulled, when the seeds are ripe, 
and are called the Shell Bean (French, Flageolet). Next they are 
dried and then prepared in various ways. The White Marrow Fat, 
the Golden Wax, and the Dwarf Soisson are among the best varie- 
ties. To have Beans well cooked pure water must be used, some 
varieties having hard shells, which will not boil tender. This can 
be remedied by adding some carbonate of soda while they are being 
boiled. For early cultivation the American Garden Bush Bean is 
the earliest and hardfest. The Garden Bush or Pole Running Beans 
are tender annual plants, originally from the East Indies. The 
dwarf varieties require no poles or sticks for their support. 



CULTURE OF THE DWARF OR BUSH BEAN. 

No. 117. A succession of sowing can be made according to the 
latitude. Plant in drills about two inches deep, and from eighteen 
inches to two feet apart, according to the richness of the soil. 

EARLY FEEGEE. 

No. 118. The earliest variety and very prolific. 

EARLY RED VALENTINE. 

No. 119. Tender and succulent, and of excellent flavor. They 
continue longer in their green state than most varieties. 

WHITE VALENTINE. 

No. 120. Similar in growth to the red valentine. It is a very 
prolific bearer, and the fact of the bean being white gives it addi- 
tional value, as it enables it to be used as a shell bean. 

GALLEGA, OR LARGE REFUGEE. 

No. 121. A standard sort for market or private use. Is very 
prolific; pods and beans are large. 

EARLY MOHAWK. 

No. 122. An excellent early variety, very productive, and of good 
quality. 



32 HARDER'S AMERICAN COOKERY. 

BLACK WAX, OR BUTTER. 

No. 123. The pods when ripe are of a waxy yellow transparent 
color, very tender, excellent, and delicious. 

WHITE WAX. 
No. 124. A variety similar to the black wax, except in color. 

IVORY POT WAX. 

No. 125. The pods are long, and almost of a transparent waxy 
white color, and are entirely stringless. In tenderness it excels 
almost all the other kinds. The beans when ripe are of medium 
size, white, and oval. It is an excellent Shell Bean for winter use. 

CANADIAN WONDER. 

No. 126. Produce very large pods with great abundance; very 
fleshy, and exceedingly tender when cooked. 

GOLDEN REFUGEE. 

No. 127. Pods perfectly round, and of a very light color. It is 
particularly well suited for pickling. 

CRYSTAL WHITE WAX. 

No. 128. Produces pods of fair size of exceedingly rich and ten- 
der flavor. In color waxy white, and almost as transparent as glass. 
It is a stringless variety, very productive, and the pods though 
quick to develop are slow to harden. 

GOLDEN WAX. 

No. 129. Is an entirely different variety, the pods are large, log,

piece of butter. Serve with boiled rice or fried bread crumbs. 

PUREE OF BEANS, FOR FAST DAYS. 

No. 204. All of the purees of beans described in this book, may 
be prepared without using meats or broth, if desired. In this case 
use water, carrots, onions, leeks and celery, and a faggot of parsley, 
well garnished with herbs. When the beans are three-quarters 
cooked add to them the crumbs of a loaf of bread. When 
thoroughly cooked remove the faggot and carrots, leaving the leek, 
celery, and onions, if desired. Then rub the soup through a fine 
sieve and season it properly. 

NOTES ON BEANS. 

No. 205. When beans are boiled with salt pork they should not 
be seasoned too much, as the pork itself contains considerable salt. 

The pork should be washed in cold water and care taken not to 
use any that is rancid. 

When bacon is used, trim it and then parboil it for five minutes. 
Then immerse it in cold water to remove the smoky taste. 

Dry Beans should first be carefully picked, as there are always 
small stones and pieces of earth mixed with them. Wash them 
well in cold water, and allow them to soak in fresh water over 
night. 

When dry Beans are soaked in lukewarm water, and the water is 
several times renewed, they will cook much quicker than when 
soaked in cold water.

Betttravc. Runkel Rube. 

No. '206. The "Beet is a hardy biennial root plant of a blood-red 
color. It contains a large substance of sugar and is much used as 
a vegetable, for salads, and as a relish. It is refreshing and nu- 
tritious when properly prepared. There are five varieties of Beets. 
The Swiss chard, or sea-kale Beet, is a distinct vegetable and much 
superior to the common Beet for greens. If sown at the same time 
as the common varieties, it will be fit to use before them. Later 
on the plants form broad, flat, beautiful white and wax- like stems 
to the leaves, which are very delicious when cooked. The young 
leaves of the common varieties are cooked with sorrel, or cooked 
and prepared the same as spinach. Still another variety is called 
the mangel, which is seldom used for the table. 

CULTUEE. 

No. 207. The soil which is suitable for the culture of the Beet 
is that which is rather light than otherwise, provided always that it 
is thoroughly enriched by manure. Sow them in drills one foot 
apart and two inches deep. When the plants have attained three 
or four leaves then thin them out so they may stand five or six 
inches apart. Keep them free from weeds by hand weeding or 
hoeing. In October the roots may be taken up and stored in the 
cellar or in pits outside, like potatoes, care being taken that they 
are not bruised or injured in the process. 

EGYPTIAN BEET TUBNIP. 

No. 208. The earliest Beet and one of the leading market sorts, 
having a deep crimson color. 

BASTIAN'S BLOOD TUENIP. 

No. 209. An early variety of a blood red color, when properly 
cooked. 

DEWING'S BLOOD BEET. 

No. 210. The roots are of a deep blood red color. It is of fine 
form and flavor, very early and an excellent variety. 



48 HARDER'S AMERICAN COOKERY. 

EARLY FLAT BASSANO. 
No. 211. Chiefly valuable for its earliness. 

LONG SMOOTH BLOOD RED. 

No. 212. An excellent late variety. 

EARLY YELLOW BEET. 

213. Similar to the blood red, but different in color. The flesh 
is yellow, tender and sweet. 

PINE APPLE BEET. 

No. 214. A highly esteemed English variety of rich deep crim- 
son color. 

BRAZILIAN VARIEGATED. 

No. 215. Beautiful for garnishing and flower garden decoration. 
The stems and veins are richly colored with crimson, yellow and 
white. 

SWISS CHARD, OR SEA KALE BEET. 

No. 216. This variety is cultivated solely for its leaves. The 
midrib is stewed and served the same as asparagus, and the other 
parts of the leaves are used like spinach. If it is cut often, new 
and more tender leaves will be produced. 

HOW TO PREPARE BEETS FOR COOKING. 

No. 217, Beets when young are prepared as a vegetable for the 
table. They must be boiled whole, without having anything cut 
from them except the tops. These must always be cut an inch from 
the root and care taken not to injure the root, for if it is in any way 
injured the beet will lose its flavor and color. When boiled let 
them get cold, then peel or rub off the skin and prepare as needed. 

BOILED BEETS STEWED. 

No. 218. Boil the Beets, and when done skin and slice them. 
If large, cut them in two and put them in a saucepan. Season with 
salt and pepper and add a piece of butter, tossing them over the 
fire. Serve hot, or boil a glass of vinegar with a piece of butter, 
seasoned with salt and pepper, and pour it over the Beets. 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE. 49 

STEWED BEETS, HANOVERIAN STYLE. 

No. 219. Boil one dozen ordinary sized Beets and when done skin 
and slice them. Put into a saucepan one fine chopped white onion 
with a piece of butter. Fry it lightly and then add a Vine-glassful 
of vinegar. When it boils add the sliced beets and four ounces of 
butter. Season with salt and pepper. Toss them over occasionally 
until thoroughly warmed, and before serving add some fine 
chopped parsley. 

STEWED BEETS, WITH CREAM SAUCE. 

No. 220. Make a Cream sauce seasoned with salt, pepper, nutmeg 
and coriander. Add the sliced Beets, and, when thoroughly 
warmed, serve them. 

STEWED BEETS, WITH BUTTER SAUCE. 

No. 221. Prepare the Beets as first described in No. 218. Add 
a few spoonfuls of Butter sauce, tossing them well over, and before 
serving add some fine chopped parsley. 

STEWED BEETS, ST. IGNATIUS. 

No. 222. Chop a white onion fine and put it into a saucepan 
with four ounces of butter. Fry it lightly and then add two soup 
spoonfuls .of flour. Cook to a light brown, while stirring it with a 
wooden spoon. Dilute this with a small wine-glassful of vinegar 
and some white broth to make a light sauce. Add three dozen 
young boiled Beets, cut into quarters, allowing them to simmer for 
fifteen minutes. 

ROAST BEETS. 

No. 223. Use medium sized Beets. Rub them with a towel 
well impregnated with brandy, lay them on a wire crate and place 
it into a roasting pan. This mode will permit them to cook more 
evenly, as it takes about six hours to have them properly done. 
The crust of the Beet will then be carbonized. In cooking- Beets 
in this manner all the sugary substance of the Beet concentrates in 
the center. It makes a most delicious dish, but is seldom prepared 
in this way in consequence of the time used in cooking. 

BEETS FOR GARNITURE. 

No. 224. When the Beets are boiled, rub off the skin and trim 
them. Place them whole in earthen jars, covering them with 
4 



50 HAEDEE'S AMEEICAN COOKEEY. 

vinegar, and when garnishing salads with them they are cut into 
various fancy shapes. 

BEET FEITTEES, CHAETEEUSE. 



No. 225. When the Beets are boiled, peel them and then slice 
them, but not too thin. Spread them on the table and cover half 
the sliced Beets with a thin slice of onion. Then season them with 
salt and a little nutmeg and sprinkle over them a little fine chopped 
parsley or chives. Then cover each of these with the other slices 
of Beets, pressing each of them well together. Dip them into 
frying batter and fry in hot lard. Drain them on a napkin and dish 
them up and garnish with fried parsley. 

NOTE. Burnet or chives finely chopped may be used with the parsley in seasoning them. 

BEET SUGAE. 

No. 226. Beets are largely cultivated -for the manufacture of 
sugar, which was first made about 1812, by a French chemist, dur- 
ing the blockade and siege of the First Empire. Beet sugar is 
cheaper than that made from the cane, but is not so profitable in 
its use. 

BEET JUJCE FOE SOUPS. 

No. 227. Beet juice is made for certain kinds of Polish soups, as 
is explained in the book on soups. Peel and cut in quarters enough 
of the finest kind of red beets to fill a small barrel. After putting 
them in the barrel pour in a sufficient quantity of cold water to 
cover them. Then put a linen cloth over the top and the cover 
over that. Place the barrel where the temperature is mild, to allow 
the liquid to ferment. In eight or ten days drain off the liquid and 
use it as directed. If bread crumbs or barley is used it will bring 
on fermentation much quicker. 

BEET SALAD WITH VEGETABLES. 

No. 228. Beets mixed with corn salad, lamb lettuce or celery 
make a fine salad. 

Youn^ Beets sliced, with an equal proportion of artichoke 
bottoms, potatoes, white beans and glazed onions, and seasoned 
with salt, pepper, vinegar and olive oil, and nicely arranged in a 
salad bowl garnished with water cress, makes a fine breakfast 
salad. 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE. 51 

PICKLED BEETS. 

No. 229. When the Beets are boiled, slice them and lay them 
in jars, alternating each layer with sliced onions, a little horse- 
radish, and a few cloves. When the jar is full, cover them with 
vinegar. These pickled Beets are for immediate use. 

PICKLED BEETS FOB RELISHES, GERMAN STYLE. 

No. 230. When the Beets are boiled, peel them and cut them 
into slices one-eighth of an inch thick. Lay the slices in layers in 
an earthen jar, alternating each layer with some fine sliced onions, 
a few grains of pepper and coriander (or cumin if desired). When 
the jar is full, pour over the Beets some cold boiled vinegar, into 
which you add (while boiling it) four ounces of sugar to each quart 
of vinegar. Cover them tight and keep in a cool place. 

NOTE. If prepared with cumin, leave out the onions. 

BEETS TOR RELISHES, AMERICAN STYLE. 

No. 231. Slice fine four cold boiled Beets, and season them with 
salt and pepper. Dish them in relish dishes and set in a cool 
place. Mash the yolks of two hard-boiled eggs fine, and dilute 
them with two soup-spoonfuls of oil and vinegar. When ready to 
serve, pour the sauce over the Beets, and garnish with fine chopped 
hard-boiled eggs.

Froitch BENE. German 

Ben. Bene. 

No. 232. Bene is said to have been introduced from Africa. It 
is a hardy annual plant, much used in the Southern States. The 
seeds are used for food (being first parched), stewed with meats, 
and are also used for puddings the same as rice. An oil is 
extracted from the seed, which does not easily become rancid, and 
is used for softening and whitening the skin. The leaves, if 
immersed in a tumbler of water, will convert it into a mucilaginous 
drink, very beneficial in cases of cholera-infantum and diarrhoea. 



52 HAEDEE'S AMERICAN COOKERY. 

CULTURE. 

No. 233. Sow in spring, as soon as the weather is settled, in. 
rich, sandy soil, carefully prepared, and allow the plants to stand 
two feet apart, keeping the ground loose and free from weeds. The 
plant will yield a greater amount of herbage if the top is broken or 
cut off when three-quarters grown. 

BI-FOEMED LEAVED. 

No. 234. The plant is large. The lower leaves are two-parted,, 
while those of the upper part of the stalk are oval and entire. 

OVAL LEAVED. 

No. 235. The stem is about two feet high, with a few short 
branches. The leaves are oblong, and entire on the borders. 

TEI-FIDE LEAVED. 

No. 236. This is taller and more vigorous than the preceding 
kinds. The leaves are tri-fide, or three-parted.

French BOLETUS (Esculent). German 

Cepes. JMorcheln. 

No. 237. This is a variety of the Mushroom family, comprising 
only two species that are eatable. 

The Boletus etulis is very palatable, resembling the common 
mushroom in taste. 

The Boletus scaber is of good quality, when young and fresh, but 
is of little value when dried, as it loses much of its odor and be- 
comes insipid and unfit for use. For preparation, see Mushrooms.

ARTICLE XXI. 



French BORAGE. German 

Bourrache. Boretsch. 

No. 238. Borage is a hardy annual plant, being used as a pot 
herb and for bee pasturage. The leaves, immersed in water, give 
an agreeable taste and flavor. It is used sometimes for medicinal 
purposes. The leaves when young are often used for salads. The 
flowers are dried in the shade and used for tisanes. The flower is 
star shaped, colored blue, white or red, and is occasionally used by 
female cooks to garnish dishes. 

CULTUEE. 

No. 239. Sow in April in rich sandy soil, carefully prepared, in 
drills ten inches apart and half an inch deep. The stalk and foliage 
contains a large proportion of nitre, and when dry they burn like 
match paper.

and sore throats. The leaves are driei, placed in boxes, and kept 
in a dry place until used. 



ARTICLE xxill. 



BROCOLI. 

Choux Broccoli. Brocoli or Spargel KhL 

No. 241. Brocoli resembles cauliflower, but is more hardy. In 
parts of this country, where the winter is not severe, it is to be 
had from November to March. It is one of the best vegetables, 
has a fine flavor and is easily digested. There are two kinds, the 



54 HARDER'S AMERICAN COOKERY. 

white and the purple. The Brocoli is not as compact as the 
cauliflower, its branches being longer and separate. It is prepared 
in all the styles that cauliflower is prepared in. 

CULTURE. 

No. 242. In the Northern States sow them in May and transplant 
in June. In the Southern States sow them in July and transplant 
in August, as they dislike summer heat more than cold weather. 
They succeed best in a moist and rather cool atmosphere. Sow in 
deep rich soil, with an abundance of moisture, which in dry seasons 
must be applied artificially. 

WHITE CAPE. 

No. 243. The heads are of medium size; close, compact, and of 
a creamy white color. One of the most certain to head. 

PURPLE CAPE. 

No. 2i4. One of the hardiest and most popular varieties, most 
certain to form a good head, and is the earliest of the purple varieties. 

BROCOLI, ITALIAN STYLE. 

* 

No. 245. Cut the flower buds of the Brocoli in small bunches, 
boil them in water, lightly salted, and when tender drain them. 
Put them into a saucepan with a piece of butter, and season with 
salt and pepper, tossing them over a brisk fire. Before serving 
them pour over them some Anchovy butter sauce, in which add the 
juice of a lemon and some finely chopped parsley. 

BROCOLI WITH HOLLANDAISE SAUCE. 

No. 246. Trim and boil them the same as in No. 245. When 
boiled drain them on a napkin, and then pour a Hollandaise sauce 
over them. Serve hot. 

BROCOLI FOR GARNITURE. 

No. 247. Cut the flower buds in small pieces and boil them as

French BROOKLINE OR SPEEDWELL. German 

Cresfinoe'e Veronigue. Wilde Kruosemunze. 

No. 249. Brookline is a hardy perennial plant, and grows 
naturally in ditches and streams of water. The stem is thick, 
smooth and succulent. It sends out roots at the joints, by which 
the plant spreads. The whole plant is used as a salad, in the same 
manner, and for the same purpose as water cress. It is excellent 
as an anti-scorbutic. 



XXV. 



BRUSSELS SPROUTS. 

Choux de Bruxelles. Sprossen Kohl. 

No. 250. Brussels Sprouts are small cabbage sprouts the size of 
a nut. They get green in the latter part of the fall, and are one of 
the best of winter vegetables, gradually becoming more and more 
appreciated in the United States. The plant grows from two to 
three feet in height, and produces from the axils of the leaves, an 
abundance of sprouts, which have an excellent and mild flavor. 

CULTUEE. 

No. 251. The culture is the same as for cabbage. If early 
plants are raised in hot beds they will perfect themselves in Sep- 
tember. When the winters are not very severe they may remain in 
the ground, to be cut as needed. 

TALL FRENCH. 

No. 252. A variety producing an abundance of sprouts. 

DWARF IMPROVED. 

No. 253. A variety producing compact sprouts of excellent 
quality. 



56 HARDER'S AMERICAN COOKERY. 

HOW TO PREPARE BRUSSELS SPROUTS FOR COOKING. 

No. 254. Wash the Sprouts in plenty of cold water, take off the 
outer leaves, drain them and put them into a saucepan with boiling 
water lightly salted. Let them cook on a brisk fire until tender, 
and then immerse them in cold water, and when cold drain them, 
discarding the fallen leaves from the sprouts. If used as a garniture 
they should not be boiled as much as when used as a vegetable. 

BRUSSELS SPROUTS WITH FINE HERBS. 

No. 255. After the sprouts are boiled as in No. 254, spread them 
on a pan and pick off the outer leaves. Put the sprouts into a 
saucepan with a piece of butter and season them with salt and pep- 
per. Warm them thoroughly and when ready to serve add some 
fine chopped parsley. 

BRUSSELS SPROUTS WITH SAUCE. 

No. 256. After the sprouts are prepared as in Vo. 255, add some 
Allemande sauce, tossing them well together. Serve with some fine 
chopped parsley over them. 

BRUSSELS SPROUTS, SPANISH STYLE. 

No. 257. When the sprouts are boiled as in No. 254, put them 
into a flat saucepan with a piece of butter. Season them with salt, 
pepper and a pinch of sugar. Toss them over the fire until thor- 
oughly warmed, then add some Espagnole sauce. Serve them with 
a garniture of roast chestnuts and small fried sausages around the 
dish. 

BRUSSELS SPROUTS FOR GARNITURE. 

No. 258. When the sprouts are boiled as in No. 254, put them

PUKEE OF BKUSSELS SPROUTS FOR GARNITURE. 

No. 260. When the sprouts are boiled, drain them. Then put 
them into a saucepan with a piece of butter. Season them with 
salt, pepper and a little nutmeg. Toss them over the fire, adding 
some Cream sauce. Should the sprouts not be of a bright green 
color add some green of spinach. Rub the whole through a fine 
sieve. Return them to the saucepan and add a piece of butter and 
a few drops of meat glaze. 



ARTICLE XXVI. 



BUCK'S-HORN, OR COCK'S-HEAD PLANTAIN. 

French German 

Plantain oil Corn de Serf. Paradiesfeiye. 

No. 261. This is a hardy annual. The root leaves are put forth 
horizontally, and spread regularly about a common center, somewhat 
in the form of a rosette. The plant is cultivated for its leaves, 
which are used as a salad. They should be plucked while young 
and tender, or when half-grown. 

CULTURE. 

No. 262. It succeeds best in soil comparatively light. Sow in 
April in shallow drills, eight inches apart. When the plants are 
about an inch high thin them to four inches apart. 



ARTICLE XXVII. 



BUCKWHEAT. 

Sarrasin ou ble noir. Buchweilzen. 

No. 263. Buckwheat originated in Asia, but it is now universally 
grown. It is easily cultivated, and in a favorable climate will 
produce two crops. Its use is healthful and nourishing, and it is 
easy of digestion, especially when boiled with milk. When cold, 
after having been boiled, it is cut in slices and fried. When the 



58 HARDER' s AMERICAN COOKERY. 

Buckwheat flour is made into batter, it makes a winter breakfast 
dish well known to and appreciated by all Americans. Buckwheat, 
when made into bread, is only good while in its fresh state, for as 
soon as it becomes dry it splits, and on being cut, crumbles into 
small pieces and becomes hard to digest. 

COMMON BUCKWHEAT. 

No. 264. Buckwheat should be sown about the middle of June, 
and should be threshed as soon as it is dry, on the ground of a 
barn floor. If allowed to stand in mass it quickly gathers moisture. 

SILVER HULLED BUCKWHEAT. 

No. 265. This variety is a great improvement on the ordi- 
nary Buckwheat. Sown at the same time as the common Buck- 
wheat, it continues in bloom longer, matures earlier, and yields 
nearly double under the same conditions. The grain is of a 
beautiful light gray color, varying slightly in shade, and the corners 
are much less prominent than in the ordinary variety, while the 
husk is thinner, thereby saving twenty per cent, in the process of 
manufacturing into flour. 

BUCKWHEAT CAKES WITH YEAST. 

No. 266. Put three pounds of Buckwheat flour into a pan, and 
make a hole in the center of the flour. Pour into this three pints 
of water, two ounces of dissolved compressed yeast, and two 
tablespoonfuls of salt, and mix them slowly to make a light batter 
without lumps. Gather the sides together, cover the pan with a 
cloth and set it in a warm place overnight to raise. Next morning 
mix it up gently before baking. 

NOTE. When a little syrup is added to the batter in the morning, they will bake to a nicer 
color. A handful or two of corn meal is often added while mixing the Buckwheat flour. 

BUCKWHEAT CAKES WITH BAKING POWDER. 

No. 267. Put into a pan three pounds of Buckwheat flour and 
three soup-spoonfuls of baking powder. Mix them up well, and 
make a hole in the center of the flour, into which pour three pints 
of hike-warm water and two tablespoonfuls of salt and mix to a 
light batter. Ten minutes after mixing, bake it. Should the 
cakes not be light enough, add a little more baking powder, as the 
majority of baking powders are very unreliable. 

NOTE. There is to be had a prepared Buckwheat flour, which is much preferable for small 
families. This flour is easily prepared, it being only necessary to use luke-warm water and salt, but 
the batter must be used as soon as mixed. 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE, 59 

BAKING OF BUCKWHEAT CAKES. 

No. 268. Much depends on the cooking of the cakes to have 
them done properly. First, the griddle must always'be very clean, 
heated evenly, and should not be allowed to get burning hot. Grease 
it lightly with leaf lard, and drop enough batter to make ordinary 
sized cakes. Let them cook on one side before turning them, and 
serve them hot with sugar or syrup. 



ARTICLE XXVIII. 



French BUGLOSS. German 

Buglose. Ochseiizunge. 

No. 269. Bugloss is a medical and pot herb plant. It is used 
to make refreshing broths for invalids and in depuratives and 
apozems. The flower of the Bugloss is used for garnishing salads 
and cold relishes. 

CULTUKE. 

No. 270. Same as other pot herbs. 



XXIX. 



BURNET. 

Pimprenelle. Pimpinelle. 

No. 271. Is a hardy perennial plant. The leaves, proceeding 
directly from the root, are produced on long stems and are com- 
posed of from eleven to fifteen smaller leaves, which are of an oval 
form, regularly toothed, and not uniformly smooth. The leaves 
have a warm, piquant taste, and are used in salads and occasionally 
as an ingredient in soups. The roots, after being dried and pul- 
verized, are used in cases of internal hemorrhage. There are three 
varieties the hairy leaved, the large seeded, and the smooth leaved 
Burnet.

French CABBAGE. German 

Choux pomme. Kopf kohl. 

No. 273. The Cabbage is a biennial plant and is propagated from 
seed sown annually. Cabbage is a plant extensively used and is 
prepared in various ways. It is very nutritious and there are many 
varieties. The white, the green and the red may be had all the 
year round. The cauliflower, brocoli, Brussels sprouts and kale all 
belong to the Cabbage family. Cabbage should be well cooked, 
otherwise it will cause indigestion. In boiling Cabbage, if the water 
is changed, it will remove that strong odor disliked by many. To 
preserve Cabbage during winter, pull them on a dry day and turn 
them over on their heads for a few hours so as to let them drain. 
Set them in a cool cellar or bury them with their heads down in 
long trenches in a dry situation. In the Middle States bury the 
heads and parts of the stump in the open ground, placing over them 
a light covering of straw or boards to protect them from severe 
weather. The Savoy Cabbage is the best of the white sorts. The 
red Cabbage is formed the same as the other Cabbages, and only 
differs from them in color, and is preferred by many to the other 
sorts. It is best in the fall and throughout winter and keeps well, 
but the outer leaves must be occasionally removed, or else they 
will decay. 

CULTURE. 

No. 274. For the successful culture of Cabbage the very best 
quality of seed must be used. A heavy moist and fresh loam is most 
suitable, and should be highly manured, as well as deeply worked 1 . 
The early sorts should be sown very early in hot beds, hardened 
off and transplanted eighteen to twenty inches apart, early in the 
spring. In the South, sow them from the middle of September to 
the middle of October, and transplant into cold frames, to preserve 
them through the winter, setting them into open ground as early 
as possible. The late autumn and winter varieties may be sown 
from the middle to the last of spring, and transplanted when about 
six inches high, three feet apart each wa.y. Shade and water the 
late sowings in dry weather to get them up. It is important that 
the plants should stand thinly in the seed bed, or they will run up 
weak and slender, and be liable to make long stumps. In 
transplanting they must be set in the ground up to the first leaf, 
no matter how long the stem may be. Cabbages should be hoed

every week, and the ground stirred deeper as they advance in 
growth, throwing up a little earth to the plant each time, until they 
begin to head, when they should be thoroughly cultivated and left 
to mature. Loosening the roots will often retard the bursting of 
full grown heads. 

EARLY JEESEY WAKEFIELD. 

No. 275. The heads are very compact, of medium size, conical 
and early, as well as sure as a heading sort. 

EARLY ETAMPES. 

No. 276. This matures nearly or quite as early as the Jersey 
Wakefield, but is not as pointed. It forms small, compact heads- 
as early as the earliest, and is of excellent quality. 

EARLY YORK. 

No. 277. A very valuable early variety, with small, heart-shaped, 
firm and tender heads, of a very dwarf growth. 

EARLY LARGE YORK. 

No. 278. It succeeds the Ea*ly York and is equally desirable. 
It is of larger size, more robust, and bears the head better. 

EARLY SUGAR LOAF. 

No. 279. A very compact growing variety. The plants may set 
as close as sixteen inches apart. It is more affected by the heat 
than most of the early varieties. 

LITTLE DIXIE. 

No. 280. The heads are small, very hard and of very fine flavor. 
The plant is small but vigorous. 

HENDERSON EARLY SUMMER. 

No. 281. This is the earliest large heading Cabbage grown. It 
is so compact that it may set as close as the smaller sorts. The 
heads are large, flat or slightly conical. They keep longer without 
bursting than most of the other sorts. 



62 HARDER'S AMERICAN COOKERY. 

EARLY FLAT DUTCH. 

No. 282. The favorite second early sort. The heads are large 
and solid, broad and roundish, very tender, fine grained and of the 
best flavor, and are also well adapted for second crop for fall or

72 HARDER'S AMERICAN COOKEEY. 

SAUEB KRAUT. 

No. 326. Saner Kraut is a German preparation and is highly 
esteemed by them, when well prepared. It is made in large quanti- 
ties in this country, especially in the Northern States. It is seldom 
made in private families here, as it can be so readily procured of 
dealers at all times. To make good Sauer Kraut, only the besb of 
cabbage heads should be used. When prepared to keep for a 
certain length of time, use new barrels, or those which have con- 
tained vinegar or white wine. Sauer Kraut is cabbage cut into fine 
shreds, pickled in salt, and made to ferment in the barrel. To keep 
it well preserved, it must be kept in a cool and even temperature, 
and must be kept well pressed under the brine. It is an agreeable 
vegetable to be eaten with salted meats. 

SAUEE KRAUT, HOW TO MAKE. 

No. 327. Take a barrel and knock out the head. Then set it in 
a stationary place half a foot from the ground, in a cool and even 
temperature. Bore a hole in the barrel, about two inches from the 
bottom, and put therein a wooden faucet with a strainer inside of 
the barrel. Now select as many cabbages as are needed to fill the 
barrel, using only the best, solid white sorts procurable. Trim off 
the green leaves and cut out the stalks, then cut the cabbage into 
fine, short shreds, using a slide-board which has three or four 
knives, which are made for such a purpose. Place the slide-board 
over a wooden tub to receive the cabbage when it is cut up. Put a 
layer of salt in the bottom of the barrel, and then a layer of cabbage 
two inches thick. Add salt again, then cabbage, and thus alternate 
until the barrel is full. To every thirty pounds of cabbage use one 
and a half pounds of fine salt. 

NOTE. A few bay leaves, carraway or anise seed, may be added with the layers of cabbage, but 
should be used only with moderation. 

When the barrel is full, cover the top with a layer of cabbage 
leaves, and spread a linen cloth over this, placing on top of the 
cloth a wooden cover, made to go inside the barrel, and on this 
cover place some heavy weight that will press the cover down very 
tight. Five days after let the brine run off and add the same quan- 
tity of fresh brine, changing it once every sixth day until the brine 
has been changed four times, or until the brine runs clear and 
without odor. To keep Kraut from moulding, the brine must always 
cover the cabbage. Two months after the Kraut is first put in the 
barrel it will be ready for use. Care must be taken to always keep 
the Kraut covered after any of it has been taken from the barrel for 
use.

CALABASH, OR COMMON GOURDS. 

French Ccrman 

Citrouille on Potiron. Kurbis. 

No. 336. The Calabash is of the same family as the squash and 
pumpkin. The fruit, when young, is hairy on the outside, and quite 
soft and tender. The surface, however, becomes hard, smooth and 
glossy when the fruit is ripe. The fruit is only fit for use when 
young, and it is then pickled in vinegar, the same as cucumbers. 
The flesh, when fully ripe, is worthless, but the shells, which are 
hard, light, compact and very strong, are used in the manufacture 
of baskets and for many ornamental purposes. There are four 
varieties: the Bottle Gourd, the Hercules Club, the Powder Horn, 
and the Siphon Gourd. They are cultivated iii the same manner as 
squash or pumpkins. 



ARTICLE: XXXII. 



CALAMINT. 

Calantenl ou Calamus. Kalaminth. 

No. 337. Calamint is an aromatic root, of the Oriis variety, 
having a delicate, violet odor, and is used as a substitute to impart 
a violet flavor. 

To make the flavor, by infusion, cut the roots in small pieces, put 
them in a bottle, pour alcohol over them, and then cork the bottle 
tight. Pastry cooks use the roots for flavoring when they are dried 
and pulverized.

CANTALOUPE OR PERSIAN MELONS. 

Canted up. Melone. 

No. 338. Cantaloupes differ remarkably from tho common varie- 
ties usually cultivated. They are destitute of the thick, hard rind 
which characterizes the common melons and which renders so large 
a portion of the melon useless. The skin of the Persian Melon is 



76 HAKDER'S AMERICAN COOKERY. 

thin and delicate, the flesh being extremely tender, rich and sweet, 
flowing copiously with a cool juice that renders them still more 
grateful. They are not an early melon, and for their perfection 
require a long and warm season. 

GERMEK. 

No. 339. This is a handsome, large-sized fruit, with a deep green 
skin, closely netted. The flesh is from one to two inches deep, and 
is of a clear green color, firm, juicy, and highly flavored. It is an 
excellent variety and an abundant bearer. 

GEREE.

thick, of a pale green color, sometimes becoming reddish towards 
the center. It is exceedingly tender, and has sweet and delicately 
perfumed juice. It bears well, but requires a long season. 

HOW TO SERVE CANTALOUPES. 

No. 347. Cantaloupes are served before breakfast, and before 
dinner as a relish, or after dinner as a dessert. They should always 
be kept in a cool place an hour before serving. Select a Melon not 
over ripe, cut it in half nnd take out the seeds. Then cut it in 
ordinary sized slices and pass a knife under the flesh, without 
detaching it altogether from the rind. Serve it on a napkin, with 
salt and pepper. 

MELONS PRESERVED IN CANS. 

No. 348. All of the varieties of Melons can be preserved. The 
best are preferred, and they must not be too ripe. Cut the Melons 
in slices and remove the seeds and the softest part of the Melon.

them in cold water for two hours. Then take them out, trim the 
pieces of Melon and put them in an earthen jar. Cover them with 
a cold syrup at fourteen degrees for two hours and then drain off 
the syrup. Cook it to sixteen degrees, and when lukewarm turn it 
over them again. Repeat this four times, twice a day. The fifth 
time cook the syrup to thirty-two degrees and put in the Melon. 
Let it boil up once and then let it stand on the side of the fire for 
one and a half hours. Then take it off, and when cool put them in 
jars, covered tight, and set them in a cool dry place. If, after a 
certain time, they should ferment, boil them over again.

Canadian the latter kind being used most. They are diuretic, 
stomachic, and principally bechic. The Capillary syrup has all the 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE. 7> 

virtue of the plant, and is used by pastry cooks for Bavarian creams, 
etc. The Capillary syrup and the syrup of marsh mallow have the 
same properties, and are used for the same purposes. 

CAPILLARY SYRUP. 

No. 35-1. Take seven pounds of sugar and boil it to a light syrup. 
When it is boiling hot pour it over six ounces of Capillary. Then 
cover it and let it lay until next day, when you will drain off the 
syrup, boil it again to thirty-two degrees, and then pour it boiling 
hot over the Capillary again. When it is cold, strain it and put it 
in bottles. 

NOTE When the Capillary is boiled with the syrup, its flavor evaporates somewhat, and leaves a 
disagreeable taste.

No. 357. There are two kinds 01 Cardoons the Spanish and the 
ordinary of which there are several species which are cultivated 
for the stems and midribs. The Spanish variety is preferred, as 
the stems are thicker than the ordinary, the latter having the 



80 HARDER'S AMERICAN COOKERY. 

flavor of artichokes. It is a vegetable much esteemed in Europe, 
though seldom used in this country, but it is becoming popular here. 
The flowers are gathered and dried in the shade, and are used to 
coagulate milk. 

CULTURE. 

No. 358. Cardoon is grown for the midribs of the leaves, which 
require to be blanched the same as celery. When the plants are to 
remain, sow them early in spring, in drills three feet apart and an 
inch and a half deep. Then thin out the young plants to a foot 
apart in drills. 

LARGE SPANISH. 

No. 359. The ribs are longer than in the ordinary Cardoou, and 
the whole plant is much stronger. It runs up to seed quicker than 
the other variety. 

THE ORDINARY. 

No. 360. This is of a shiny green color, the stems growing about 
five feet high. Its leaves are large and strong.

French CARROT. German 

Carrote. Moehre. 

No. 373. The Carrot is a biennial root, somewhat hardy, and is 
one of the most healthful and nutritious of garden roots. It is 
extensively used as a vegeteble for the table, and for seasoning and 
garnitures. It contains a certain amount of sugar, which adds to 
its nutritious quality. There are several different varieties, all of 
which can be obtained all the year round. The larger varieties are 
also cultivated as an agricultural root, and are better suited than 
other kinds of food for dairy cattle, not alone because they are 
nutritious, but because they impart a good color and flavor to the 
butter. 

CULTURE. 

No. 374. The Carrot succeeds best in light, sandy loam, made 
rich by manuring the previous year. The roots often grow pronged 
and ill-shaped, in imperfectly manured ground. It is better to sow 
as early in spring as the ground can be got ready, but if planting is 
necessarily delayed until late in the season, the seed must be soaked 
in tepid water twenty-four hours, then dry it by mixing in sifted 
ashes, and sow it in fully prepared soil. 

EARLY FRENCH FORCING. 

No. 375. This is the earliest variety, is valuable for forcing, and 
has a small root of fine flavor. 

EARLY SCARLET HORN. 

No. 376. An old and favorite variety, much esteemed for sum- 
mer use. 

HALF LONG RED (STUNTED ROOTS). 

No. 377. A variety intermediate in size, with stunted roots. Its 
period of maturity is between the Early Scarlet Horn and the Long 
Orange. 

HALF LONG SCARLET (POINTED ROOTS). 

No. 378. This is similar to the Half Long Bed with stunted 
roots, except that the roots are pointed. 



84 HAEDEK'S AMERICAN COOKERY. 

EARLY HALF LONG SCARLET CAREXTON. 

No. 379. An early variety without core, and is excellent for 
forcing, or is used as an early kind for planting in the open ground. 

LONG ORANGE. 

No. 380. It is adapted for garden or farm culture, and has large- 
jsized roots. 

DANYERS. 

No. 381. This is a valuable variety having the smallest root of 
any kind grown, but it will yield the greatest bulk. Its color is a 
rich shade of orange and it grows very smooth and handsome. 

ALTRINGHAM. 

No. 382. An excellent variety, large and finely flavored. 

LARGE WHITE BELGIAN. 

No. 383. A very productive variety, but grown almost exclusive- 
ly for stock. 

YELLOW BELGIAN. 

No. 384. When young, the roots are mild, delicate and of good 
flavor; when full grown, it is only valuable for stock. 

HOW TO PREPARE CARROTS FOR COOKING. 

No. 385. Carrots should always be scraped, and should only be 
prepared when ready for use. When young use them as a vegeta- 
ble, and prefer those that are stunt rooted. Cook them whole, or 
cut them in ^rnall parts. The large carrots are cut in different 
shapes, with spoon cutters, for garnitures, but when used as a veg- 
etable, cut them in a short, thick Julienne. When used for Julienne 
soup, cut them two inches crosswise; then slice them, and cut them 
lengthwise in small stems. When they get older, use only the red 
part, which you peel off by cutting it the same thickness. In this 
way the pieces will stay whole, but in the other way the pieces will 
break off when cooked. 

CARROTS MAITRE D' HOTEL. 

No. 386. Take three dozen young carrots and cut each one in

Froi:c! CATERPILLAR. German 

Scorpiure. Raupenpflanzen. 

No. 404. A hardy annual plant with creeping stems,- that are 
about two feet 'in length. The seeds are produced in pods. No 
part of the plant is eatable, but the pods, in their green state, are 
placed upon dishes of salad, and so closely do they resemble a real 
caterpillar, that they will oftentimes deceive the uninitiated. 

CULTURE. 

No. 405. Sow them in April, fifteen inches apart, in rows that 
are fifteen inches wide.

in stores, and having the advantage of being pure and healthful. 



XLII. 



FrciicJi CAULIFLOWER German 

Choiifleur. Blumen Kohl. 

No. 409. The Cauliflower, like Brocoli, is an annual plant, being 
delicious in flavor. It requires a cool, moist atmosphere to bring 
it to perfection, and if this condition occurs when the plant is about 
to head, fine large heads will result, whereas, if the air is hot and 
dry, failure will result in spite of the best of seeds and cultivation. 
Brocoli is a species of Cauliflower, and both are prepared in the 
same style. See Brocoli, Article XXIII. 

CULTURE. 

No. 410. For the spring or summer crop, sow the early varieties, 
about the last of winter, in hot-beds, and transplant them into the 
open air as soon as the ground can be worked. For the late autumn 
crop, sow the late varieties about the middle of spring, and trans- 
plant them as you would winter cabbages. In dry weather water 
them freely, and as they advance in growth hoe deep and draw 
earth to the stems. After they begin to head they should be watered 
every other day. In two or three weeks the strongest will begin to 
form flower heads, which should be cut for use while the curd is close 
and compact. It is then tender and delicious, but later on the head 
opens and separates into branches and soon becomes coarse, fibrous, 
strongly flavored, and unfit for use. The leaves should be gathered 
and tied loosely over the tops of the heads to facilitate blanching. 
On the approach of frost, those plants that have not headed may 
be set out in a cellar and can be aired in mild weather. 

EARLY SNOWBALL. 

No. 411. This is the earliest of all Cauliflowers. Its heads 
measure from 8 to 9 inches in diameter. Every plant forms a fine 
head. Its dwarf habit and short interleaves allow it to be planted 
as close as 18 inches apart each way. This variety does equally 
well for late planting.

piece of butter. When cooked, drain them on a napkin and be 
careful riot to break the flowered buds. Serve on a napkin, with 
Butter sauce separate. 

CAULIFLOWER, HOLLANDAISE. 

No. 422. Prepare the same as in No. 420. When cooked, drain 
them on a napkin. Put the Cauliflowers on a dish and put Hollan- 
daise sauce over them. 

If they are small and detached, put them in a bowl with the heads 
downward. Press them lightly, moulding them together, as it 
were, in the bowl, so they will all form together, making one large 
head. Then put it on a plate with the head up, and pour Hollan- 
daise sauce over it. 

CAULIFLOWER BAKED, AU GRATIN. 

No. 423. Cook the Cauliflowers as in No. 421. Drain off all the 
moisture and season them with salt, pepper and nutmeg. Then put

Parmesan cheese. Sprinkle fresh bread crumbs over them and put 
a small piece of butter on top. Wipe the borders off clean, and 
then bake in an oven. 

CAULIFLOWER FRIED, VILLEROI. 

No. 424. Cook the Cauliflowers the same as in No. 421. After 
you drain them, cut off the flowered heads in small bunches and dip 
them in Villeroi sauce. Set them in a cool place, so the sauce will 
adhere to the Cauliflower. Then bread them with fresh bread 
crumbs. After this, dip them in beaten eggs and bread them again. 
Fry them in hot lard, until nicely browned, and serve them on a 
napkin, with fried parsley as a garniture.

No. 431. Cook four heads of Cauliflower as in No. 421, and 
when drained put them in a saucepan with one gallon of thickened 
chicken or veal broth. Season it with salt and pepper, then rub 
it through a fine sieve and put it in a saucepan to boil for ten 
minutes. Before serving add one pint of cream diluted with the 
yolks of six raw eggs and a piece of butter. Add some small square 
pieces of breast of boiled chicken. 

CAULIFLOWER PICKLED. 

No. 432. After you have picked and washed a number of Cauli- 
flo-.vers, cut off about three pounds of the flowered buds and arrange 
them in small bunches all of the same size. Pat them in a pan of 
cold water. Then put some lightly salted water in a saucepan, and 
when it boils add the Cauliflowers. Let them boil for six minutes, 
then drain them and put them in an earthen jar. Then pour hot 
boiling vinegar over them and keep the cover on the jar until the 
next day, when you will drain off the vinegar. Then boil the vin- 
egar again, adding a little salt, and pour it hot over the Cauliflower 
in the jar. When cold cover them tight and set them in a cool 
place. If glass jars are used pour the vinegar in slowly at first, as 
the glass is liable to crack. 

CAULIFLOWER PRESERVED IN BRINE. 

No. 433. After you have picked and washed the Cauliflowers cut 
off the flowering buds in large bunches. Parboil them six minutes, 
then immerse them in cold water and afterwards drain them. Put 
them in earthen jars with a boiled salt brine of 18 degrees (sugar 
weight). x Two days later drain off the brine and boil it over again, 
adding salt to bring it to 18 degrees. Pour it over the Cauliflower 
and cover the jar tight. When ready to use soak them in cold 
water for five hours, boil in fresh water, and serve as needed.

French CELERIAC, OR TURNIP ROOTED CELERY. German 

Celeri Rave.. Knol Selleri. 

No. 434. This variety has a brownish, irregular root, at the base 
of the leaves near the surface of the ground. It is much hardier 
than the common variety of celery. Those required for winter use 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE. 95 

should be drawn, packed in sand, and stored in the cellar before 
severe weather sets in. It is used in the same manner as the 
common celery. Its root, or bulb, is the only part eaten. Its flesh 
is w r hite and tender, having the flavor of the stalks of common 
celery, though less mild and delicate. The leaf-stalk is used most 
for flavoring soups, and the bulbs are stewed or used in salad the 
same as celery. 

CULTURE. 

No. 435. Sow it early in spring, in light, rich soil, and transplant 
it in May into beds, and water it freely in dry weather. When the 
plants are almost full grown, it is customary to earth up the bulbs 
to the height of four or five inches. In about a month they will be 
sufficiently blanched for use. The roots, which resemble turnips, 
will be ready in October, and may be preserved in sand during 
winter. It is -a vegetable that is much esteemed for culinary pur- 
poses. 

LARGE ERFURT. 

No. 436. This is a variety of Celeriac, having turnip-shaped 
roots, which may be cooked and sliced, and used with vinegar, to 
make an excellent salad. It is more hardy, and may be used in the 
same manner as celery. 

APPLE-SHAPED. 

No. 437. This is a great improvement over the old variety, 
having small foliage, and large, round and smooth tubers. 

CELERIAC FRIED, VILLEROI. 

No. 438. Pare and then wash six Celeriac roots in cold water 
and cut them in quarters. Take off the hard part, trim them 
in scallops, parboil them, for 15 minutes, and drain them. Then 
put them in a flat saucepan lined with slices of fat pork and moisten 
them with white broth. Season with salt, pepper, nutmeg and a 
pinch of sugar. Then cover them with thin slices of fat pork, put 
them on the fire and let them cook slowly. When cooked take out 
the Celeriac and dry them on a napkin. Then strain the gravy in 
another saucepan and add four spoonfuls of Allemande sauce. Re- 
duce it on a brisk fire and when cool dip the Celeriac in the sauce. 
Then arrange them in a pan and set them in a cool place, and when 
they are cold and the sauce adheres to the Celeriac, bread them in 
fresh bread crumbs. Then dip them in beaten eggs and bread them 
again. Fry them in hot lard and serve on a dish having a puree 
of Celeriac in the center. 



96 HARDEE'S AMERICAN COOKERY. 

CELERIAC PUREE FOR GARNITURE.

ters, then trim them all alike, and cook and serve them the same as 
Celery, No. 462. 

CELERIAC, FOR SOUPS. 

No. 444. Prepare the same as those with common celery. Celeriac 
should always be added with the common celery in soups or purees, 
as it gives it a better flavor. The roots are also used for all of the 
other vegetable soups when celery is used in their combination. 

CELERIAC, PRESERVED. 

No. 445. Peel and wash one dozen Celeriac roots and cut them 
in quarters. Trim them all the same size and parboil them for five 
minutes. Put two gallons of water in a saucepan, and when it boils 
put in it three spoonfuls of flour (diluted with a little cold water), 
the juice of three lemons and a little salt, and then add the 
Celeriac roots. When three-quarters cooked, take them off of the 
fire and let them cool. Then take out the Celeriac roots, dip them

size, not too thin. Parboil them in water lightly salted, until three 
quarters cooked. Then drain them and arrange them in an earthen 
jar. Then boil some wine vinegar and pour it over the Celeriac in 
the jar, while hot. Add a few grains of pepper and a few fennel leaves. 
Cover the jar and let it stand until the next day, when you will 
drain otf the vinegar and put the Celeriac in glass jars. Put 
in a bowl four spoonfuls of English mustard flour. Dilute it with 
vinegar, add some red pepper, and mix it well together, to have a 
light gravy. Pour it over the Celeriac roots, then cover the jar and 
put it away. 

CELERIAC PRESERVED IN BRINE. 

No. 447. Peel and wash two dozen Celeriac roots, and cut them 
in quarters. Parboil them until three-quarters cooked. Then 
immerse them in cold water, drain them, and dry them on a napkin. 
Put them in earthen jars and cover them with a strong boiled brine, 
when cold. Cover them and let them lay for two days, and then 
drain otf the brine. Then boil the brine again, adding salt, to have 
it at about 16 or 18 degrees (sugar weight). When it is cold pour 
it over the Celeriac in the jars, put the covers on tight and put the 
jars in a cool place. When you are ready to use them soak them 
in fresh water for a few hours, and prepare them as required.

French CELERY. German 

Celeri. Selleri* 

No. 448. Celery is a hardy, umbelliferous biennial plant, and is 
always propagated from seed. The stems of the leaves are the parts 
of the plant that are used. These, after being blanched, are exceed- 
ingly crisp and tender, having an agreeable and peculiar aromatic 
flavor. They are prepared in various ways, but are generally served 
raw, for a relish, with salt or with oil, vinegar and mustard sauce. 
They are almost indispensable for salads. 



98 HAKDER'S AMERICAN COOKERY. 

CULTURE. 

No. 449. Sow the seed in shallow boxes, or in a finely prepared 
bed out of doors, in straight rows, so that the small plants may be 
kept free from weeds. When about two inches high, thin them out 
and transplant them so they will stand two inches apart. When 
they are about four inches high cut off the tops, which will cause 
them to grow stocky. The crop is usually an early one, and if good 
plants are used, they may be set out as late as the middle of August. 
The best results, however, are obtained by setting them out in the 
middle of June or the first of July. When setting them out, prepare 
broad, shallow trenches, about six inches deep and four feet apart, 
in which the plants should be set six inches apart. Cut off the 
outer leaves and press the soil firmly about the roots. In about six 
weeks the plants should be handled, which is done by having one 
man gather the leaves together while a second man draws the earth 
about the plant to one-third of its height, being careful that none 
of the earth falls between the leaves, as that would cause them to 
rust or rot. In a few days draw more earth around them, and repeat 
this process every few days until only the tops of the leaves are 
visible. In a few days more it will be fit for use. Do not disturb 
the plants when the ground is wet, as that will injure them. 

At the approach of severe, freezing weather, take up the plants 
and put them in a light cellar or an unused frame, where the tem- 
perature can be kept above the freezing point. Set them out 
compactly, so that all but the tops of the leaves can be covered with 
sand. They will then gradually blanch, and may be used throughout 
the winter. 

DWARF WHITE. 

No. 450. A favorite market variety of close habit, being solid, 
crisp and tender.

flavor. Its graceful and feather-like foliage, when blanched, makes 
it a most beautiful Celery for the table. 



HALF DWARF. 

No. 454. A remarkably fine white variety, intermediate in size 
between the Dwarf and Large White. When blanched it is of a 
yellowish white color, making it very ornamental for the table. It is 
entirely solid, possessing a rich nutty flavor. 

GOLDEN DWARF. 

No. 455. This is ar distinct variety in size, but grows similar to 
the Half Dwarf, except that when blanched the heart, which is large, 
is of a waxy golden yellow color, which renders it most striking. It 
is entirely solid, has an excellent flavor and keeps well during 
winter. 

LONDON BED. 

No. 456. The red Celery is generally superior to the white, being 
better flavored and more crisp. It is also hardier and keeps better 
in winter. The London Red is one of the best varieties, having 
every requisite goqd quality. 

MAJOR CLARK PINK. 

No. 457. There is a disposition to grow red or pink Celery in 
preference to the white, which is as it should be, for as regards the 
flavor the red and pink are far superior to the white. The Major 
Clark Pink is a variety of medium growth of stiff, close habit, hav- 
ing a large heart, remarkably solid and crisp, and of a fine walnut 
flavor. 

HOOD'S DWARF RED. 

No. 458. An excellent dwarf variety, solid and crisp. 

HOW TO PREPARE CELERY FOR GENERAL USE. 

No. 459. Trim off the green stems, then cut off the tops, leaving

dish, strain the gravy through a fine sieve, and skim off the grease. 
Then pour the gravy over the Celery and serve. ' 

CELERY STEWED, SPANISH STYLE. 

No. 463. Clean and wash the Celery and cut the white part in 
pieces of even size two inches long. Parboil them for three 
minutes, then immerse them in cold water and dry them on a nap- 
kin. Put the Celery in a flat saucepan, with a piece of butter, 
and season with salt, pepper, nutmeg, and a pinch of sugar. 
Cover the saucepan and let the Celery simmer until the moisture is 
reduced. Then cover it with white broth. Let it reduce on a brisk 
fire to a glaze, when the Celery must be cooked. Then add three 
spoonfuls of Tomato sauce and one of Espagnole sauce, and let it 
cook slowly for ten minutes. Add a small piece of butter, some 
parsley chopped fine, and toss it all well over a fire. Then serve 
with small toast of marrow around the dish as a garniture. 

CELERY STEWED WITH ALLEMANDE SAUCE. 

No. 464. Prepare the Celery the same as in No. 463, and when 
it is cooked to a glaze add four spoonfuls of Allemande sauce.

Cream sauce in place of Allemande sauce. Instead of lemon juice 
-add a few drops of meat glaze, and then serve. 

CELERY SAUCE. 

No. 466. Cut the tender part of two heads of Celery in pieces 
one inch long, or smaller if desired. Put them in a saucepan with 
enough water to cover them and season with salt. Let them boil 
until tender and then drain off half of the water. Add a pint of 
boiling milk and when it all boils add four ounces of butter in 
which you will mix two spoonfuls of flour, stirring it gently until 
melted. Season with salt, pepper and nutmeg, letting it boil 10 or 
15 minutes. 

CELERY FRIED, VILLEROI. 

No. 467. When the Celery is trimmed and washed, cut the ten- 
der stems in pieces four inches long. Parboil them for five minutes, 
then immerse them in cold water and drain them on a napkin. Put 
them in a saucepan with some broth to cover them, and season with 
salt, pepper and a little sugar. Let them cook slowly until tender, 
then take them out and drain off the moisture on a napkin. Then 
dip them in a cool Villeroi sauce, and place them on a pan in a 
cool place. When the sauce is firm trim them, roll them in fresh 
bread crumbs, then dip them in beaten eggs and bread them 
again. Fry them in hot lard and serve them on a napkin, with 
fried parsley to garnish. 

CELERY WITH PARMESAN CHEESE. 

No. 468. Prepare the Celery the same as in No. 464. Add to 
the Allemande sauce some fine grated Parmesan cheese. Put the 
Celery in a buttered baking dish or in shells. Sprinkle the top 
with bread crumbs and grated cheese, and add a small piece of but- 
ter on top. Wipe off the borders clean and put it in an oven to 
bake. 

CELERY FOR GARNITURE. 

No. 469. Prepare the same as in Nos. 452, 463, 464, and 465, 
with but very little sauce. The Celery in No. 462 is ussd for large 



102 HABDEE'S AMERICAN COOKERY. 

garnitures. As a garniture for salad borders use it as follows: 
Trim all of the green leaves from the bottom of a head of celery, 
and cut it in pieces two inches long. Then slice it thin and cut the 
broad stems an inch deep, without detaching them. Then lay them 
in cold water for an hour, and they will be nicely frizzled. That is, 
the little shreds will be curled. When using Celery for the 
center of a salad, take the heart of the Celery and slice it thin 
a few inches from the top, and lay the pieces in cold water for an 
hour, when it will be nicely frizzled. This makes an attractive 
garniture over the salad. 

CELERY PUREE, FOR GARNITURE. 

No. 470. Clean and trim six heads of Celery, cut the white parts 
in small pieces and parboil them for ten minutes. Then immerse 
them in cold water, drain them dry, and put the Celery in a 
saucepan with a piece of butter, and season it with salt, pepper, 
nutmeg, and a pinch of sugar. Add some white broth to cover it, 
then cover the saucepan and put it on a brisk fire to cook. When 
the moisture is reduced, and the Celery well cooked, add one pint 
of Allemande or Cream sauce. Rub it all through a fine sieve, then 
put it back in the saucepan and add a cup of cream to reduce it to 
its proper consistency, stirring it well with a wooden spoon. Add 
a small piece of butter before serving. 

CELERY, WITH WHITE OR BROWN SAUCE. 

No. 471. When the Celery' is cleaned, cut the tender parts in 
pieces half an inch long. Parboil them for five minutes, then im-

the Celery in a saucepan with a piece of butter, and season it with 
salt, pepper, nutmeg, and a pinch of sugar. Then cover the sauce- 
pan and let the Celery simmer for ten minutes, not letting it get 
brown. Then moisten it with white broth, letting it reduce so as 
to glaze the Celery lightly. Then add Espagnole, Allemande or 
Cream sauce, as may be desired. 

CELERY SALAD. 

No. 472. When the Celery is trimmed and washed, cut it in 
short, thick Juliennes. Season it with salt, pepper, vinegar and oil, 
and add some chives, chopped fine. Mix it all well together, and 
when ready for use dress it in a salad bowl and garnish with sliced 
tomatoes or beets, cut in fancy shapes. 

NOTE. 'When Celery is used in chicken or lobster salad, cut it in fine slices. It will preserve 
salad better than lettuce, when the salad is kept a length of time before using. 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE. 103 

CELERY BROTH. 

No. 473. Clean and wash four heads of Celery, then cut them in 
pieces three inches long. Put them in a saucepan with one gallon 
of water. Let it boil slowly until the broth is reduced to one quart, 
and then strain it through a napkin. Drink it warm or cold. This 
is a very good beverage for nervousness. 

CELERY SOUP PUREE, SPANISH STYLE. 

No. 474. Clean and wash six heads of Celery and trim off all of 
the green parts. Cut the tender parts in small pieces, one inch 
long, mixed with two celery roots sliced fine. Parboil them for five 
minutes, then immerse them in cold water and drain and dry them. 
Then put the Celery in a saucepan, with a piece of butter, and season 
with salt, pepper, nutmeg, and a pinch of sugar. Cover the sauce- 
pan and let it simmer until the moisture is reduced. Then add two 
quarts of white broth and a faggot of parsley, garnished with leeks 
and green onions. Let it boil until the Celery is well cooked, and 
then add one gallon of thickened veal or chicken broth. Let it all 
boil slowly for twenty minutes, then take out the faggot and strain the 
soup through a fine sieve. Then put it back in the saucepan to 
keep warm. When ready to serve, add a pint of cream, diluted 
with the yolks of six raw eggs, four ounces of butter, and some 
parsley chopped fine. Mix this all well together off from the fire until 
the butter is melted. Add some small fried bread crumbs before 
serving. 

CELERY CREAM SOUP. 

No. 475. Prepare the celery the same as in No. 474, and when 
it is thoroughly cooked in the broth add three quarts of Cream 
sauce. Rub it through a fine sieve and put it back in the saucepan 
to keep it warm. Before serving it, add half a pound of butter in 
small pieces, stirring it all well until the butter is thoroughly 
merged in the soup. Also add some chervil chopped fine. The 
soup must not be too thick. Farina or vermicelli, cooked in white 
broth, may be added. 

CELERY PUREE, PRESERVED. 

No. 476. Clean and trim six heads of Celery, using only the 
white, tender part, and four Celery roots. Slice them all in small 
pieces and put them in a saucepan. Cover them with boiling water 
and add a piece of butter and a little salt. Cover the saucepan and 
let them cook until tender. Then rub the puree through a fine

boil the cans in a hot water bath for one hour and a half. 
When it is to be used, finish it with Allemande or Cream sauce. 

PRESERVED CELERY. 

No. 477. Prepare one dozen heads of Celery, cut them in pieces 
six inches long, and parboil them for five minutes. Immerse them 
in cold water, and then drain and dry them. Put them in a sauce- 
pan with one gallon of water. When it boils, add to it three 
spoonfuls of flour, diluted in cold water, and also add the juice of 
three lemons and a little salt. When it is half cooked take it off 
of the fire and let it get cold. Then take out the Celery, one 
piece at a time, and dip them in lukewarm water to clean them. 
Then arrange them in tin cans (same as asparagus), and pour 
over them some cold-boiled water, lightly salted. Add the juice 
of one lemon in each can. Solder on the cover, boil the cans in 
a hot water bath for two hours. 

CELERY PRESERVED IN BRINE. 

No. 478. Prepare the Celery and then cut each head in pieces 
six inches long. Parboil them until they are three-quarters cooked, 
then immerse them in cold water, then drain and dry them on a 
napkin. Put them in an earthen jar and cover them with a brine 
at 18 or 20 degrees (sugar weight), when cold. Cover the jar, and 
in two days remove the brine and put on the fire to boil., Add more 
salt, to bring it to the same degree as before. When it is cold, 
pour it over the Celery to cover it well. Put the cover on the jar 
tight and set it in a cool place. When ready for use soak the 
Celery in fresh water for several hours, and prepare it as required. 

CELERY VINEGAR. 

No. 479. Cut four heads of Celery in small pieces. Put them in 
an earthen jar with four ounces of Celery seed, one ounce of pulver- 
ized white sugar, and half an ounce of salt. Pour two quarts of 
boiled vinegar, when hot, over this. Cover the jar, and in two 
weeks strain it through a filter. Then put it in bottles and cork 
well. 

CELERY FLAVOR. 

No. 480. Put two ounces of Celery seed in a quart bottle and fill it

French CENTAURY. German 

Centaure'e. Tausendgiildenkraut. 

No. 481. This is a small annual herbaceous plant, which grows 
wild. It is about a foot high, having a branching stem which 
divides above into pairs, and bears oval, smooth pointed leaves, 
direct from the stem. The flowers are rose colored. The herb has 
no odor, but has a strong bitter taste, and its tonic properties are 
similar to those of gentian. It is used in cases of dyspepsia and 
fever. The roots make a valuable yellow dye. The flowers are 
gathered in bunches, hung in a dark, airy, warm room, and when 
thoroughly dried are kept in boxes, in a dry place. They are used 
in diet drinks (tisanes), see Article LXXXII.

CHAMOMILE. 

Camomille. Camomile. 

No. 482. The single and double flowering Chamomile are propa- 
gated by slips, with a few of the small roots attached, both kinds 
being claimed as hardy perennials. In the Northern States the 
plants are frequently destroyed by severe frost. The single Chamo- 
mile, though considered more efficacious for medicinal purposes, is 
not cultivated as much as tlie double flowering variety. They may 
be grown from leaves or slips. The leaves, when cut fine and 
burned, emit a peculiar, pungent odor. The flowers, which are the 
parts generally used, are in. high repute, both in the popular and 
scientific materia medica, and give out their properties by infusion in 
either water or alcohol. The flowers are also used in the manufac- 
ture of bitter beer, and along with wormwood are used to a certain 
extent as a substitute for hops. It is considered a safe bitter and 
tonic, though strong infusions, when taken warm, act sometimes as 
an emetic. 

CULTUEE. 

No. 483. Chamomile flourishes best in light poor soil, and is 
generally propagated by dividing the roots and setting them in rows 
that are a foot apart with the plants ten inches from each other. 
They grow fast and soon entirely cover the ground.

French COMMON CHIVES. ternian 

Ciboulette. Schnittlauch. 

No. 506. The Chive is a hardy, bulbous-rooted perennial plant. 
The leaves, which are produced in tufts, are seven or eight inches 
long, erect and cylindrical in shape. The young leaves are the parts 
of the plant used, and to keep them in a fresh and tender condition 
the plants should be frequently shorn to the ground. They possess 
the flavor peculiar to the onion family, and are principally used as 
an ingredient in soups and spring salads. For omelets the Chive is 
considered almost indispensable. ( See omelet with herbs.) 

CULTURE. 

No. 507. As the plant seldom, if ever, produces seeds, it is 
always propagated by a division of the roots or bulbs. The bulbs 
are planted in May, two or three together, in rows 15 inches apart, 
and covered three inches deep. They require little attention, and 
increase rapidly. If not cut to excess, a plant will continue for 
vears.

extremities numerous oblong, jointed, pale brown tubers, about the 
size of a filbert. The flesh of the tubers is tender, having a yellowish 
color, and a pleasant, sweet, nut-like flavor. When the tubers are 
dried they taste somewhat like almonds, and keep a long time. 
When dried and pulverized, they impart to water the color and 
richness of milk. They are eaten raw or roasted.

No. 511. The tree which produces the Cinnamon is supposed to 
have come originally from the Island of Ceylon, and is called the 
Cinnamon tree, or Kerandee, by the natives there. The leaves are 
similar to the bay leaves, and have the same flavor as the tree. The 
Cinnamon is the second peeling of the tree and is thin and smooth. 
It is of a yellowish red color, and has an agreeable, sweet and 
piquant flavor. It is largely used by pastry cooks and confection- 
ers and for various culinary purposes, both in sticks and ground. 
Cinnamon is also cultivated in Tonquin, but only in the King's 
domain. Cinnamon flavor mixes, and tastes better, with prepara- 
tions made with milk than any other flavor.

COCOA. 

Coco ou Cocoa. Cacao. 

No. 515. Cocoa is the fruit of the Cocoa tree, which grows in 
abundance in South America. The tree is about the size of a 
chestnut tree, and produces ribbed pods, which contain from 25 to 
50 seeds, which resemble ground almonds, and are covered with a 
dry pelicule. They have a bitter taste. There are several different 
varieties, namely, those of Caracas, of Ceylon, of Berbiche, of Saint 
Madelaine, and of Saint Domingo islands. They all differ in size 
and flavor. The best are those from Caracas, being lightly flattened 
and resembling our broad beans. The next best are those from 
St. Madelaine and Berbiche. It is less flattened than the Caracas 
variety, and its pelicule is covered with a fine, ash-colored powder. 
The other varieties are much more bitter and oily, and are mostly 
8 



Ill HARDER'S AMERICAN COOKERY. 

used to make the Cocoa Butter. The germ of the Cocoa is always 
at the thick end, while iii our almonds it is at the small end. The 
Cocoa of Caracas, St. Madelaine and Berbiche, mixed in equal 
quantities, makes the best quality of chocolate. This mixture gives 
an unctuous, oleaginous matter which chocolate should always 
possess. If chocolate is made simply from the Caracas Cocoa it 
will be too dry, while that made from the others alone would be too 
oily and bitter. Hence, the combination mentioned is necessary. 
After the Caracas beans are picked they are buried in the ground 
for four or six weeks, which causes them to lose some of their 
bitter taste. Care must be taken or they will have an exceedingly 
moisty flavor. The Caracas Cocoa, mixed with the others, always 
makes the best chocolate. 

The cocoa, broma and chocolate we drink are made from Cocoa. 
When made into chocolate, it is ground into a paste and mixed with 
sugar, etc. There are several grades, some for eating, some for 
candies and creams, and some for beverages. Cocoa and broma are 
more healthful as a breakfast beverage than chocolate, as the latter 
is too rich. 

GROUND COCOA. 

No. 516. Dilute two table-spoonfuls of ground Cocoa, with two 
spoonfuls of water. Then put it in a small saucepan and moisten it 
with three cupfuls of boiling milk or water. Stir it well and let it 
boil five minutes. Then sweeten it to taste. 

SHELL COCOA. 

No. 517. Put two ounces of half-broken Cocoa in a saucepan 
with one quart of boiling water. Let it boil slowly for half an 
hour, or until half of the moisture is reduced. Add a little milk if 
desired and sweeten to taste. This is preferred by people whose 
stomachs are deiicate. 

BROMA. 

No. 518. This is made the same as Cocoa. 

CHOCA. 

No. 519. Take a cup of chocolate, a cup of coffee and a cup of 
cream, and mix them well together. This makes a delicious bev- 
erage. 

PLAIN CHOCOLATE. 

No. 520. Scrape o-r break two ounces of Chocolate in small 
pieces. Put it in a saucepan with two table- spoonfuls of boiling 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE. 115 

water, stirring it until it is melted. Then add two cupfuls of hot 
boiled milk. Sweeten to taste. As soon as it commences to boil, 
take it off of the fire and serve. 

POT CHOCOLATE. 

No. 521. The best Chocolate is made in a pot expressly made 
for this purpose, in which there is a silver whisk. Put four cup- 
fuls of milk or water in a chocolate pot. (Or put one ounce of 
Chocolate to one cup of milk.) When the milk boils add the fine 
grated Chocolate. When the Chocolate is melted and well mixed, 
set it on the side of the fire for ten minutes to keep warm. Then 
take the whisk between the palms of both hands and make it revolve 
backwards and forwards briskly until the Chocolate is whipped to a 
froth. Then serve. 

CHOCOLATE, WITH EGGS OR CREAM. 

No. 522. Grate four ounces of Chocolate, and put it in a saucepan 
with four soup-spoonfuls of boiling water, and stir it until it is 
melted. While stirring it, add in slowly five cupfuls of boiling 
milk. Let it boil up once, then sweeten it to taste, and set it on 
the side of the fire to keep warm. Have ready the whites of four 
eggs, whipped to a stiff froth. Add half of this quantity to the 
Chocolate, mixing it well. Sweeten the remaining half of the eggs 
with powdered sugar. Serve the Chocolate in cups, with a spoonful 
of the sweetened egg froth on top. 

NOTE. Chocolate can be made as above, with cream instead of eggs. Add the cream when the 
Chocolate is ready to serve, having it whipped to a froth and flavored with vanilla. 

Stir it well when you put it in, so the hot Chocolate will warm it, 
without letting it boil. 

NOTE. Chocolate can be made with water or milk, or with both, mixed in equal quantities. This 
is merely a matter of taste, as some prefer it with water and others with milk or cream. When 
sweetened Chocolate is used, no sugar, or very little, should be added, as the delicate flavor is des- 
troyed when too sweet. Sweeten plain Chocolate to taste. Never keep Chocolate on the fire boiling. 

ADULTERATED CHOCOLATE. 

No. 523. Chocolate is often adulterated J3y unprincipled manu- 
facturers, which makes it a most vile compound instead of the 
nutritious beverage intended. They use small, common Cocoa, first 
extracting the Cocoa butter, and then mix with the remaining Cocoa 
a quantity of grilled sweet almonds. They also use the refuse of 
coarse brown sugar in place of pure sugar, and as a substitute for 
vanilla they use common storax, which is the sawdust of the Tonqua

tree; but persons experienced in flavor will detect the difference 
immediately. Impure Chocolate is also adulterated with butter, 
potato flour, starch, and other heterogeneous substances.

French COFFEE. German 

Cafe. Kafee. 

No. 524. Coffee is produced on a small bushy tree. The flowers 
are odorous, and the fruit jelly-like, having two seeds. Coffee is 
said to have originated in Arabia, but is now cultivated in different 
parts of the world. The Arabian historian, Ahmet Effeudi, wrote 
that Coffee was first used in Arabia in the fifteenth century. The 
Egyptians prepare a drink with Coffee which the Arabs call Kawa. 
Coffee was introduced in France by the Venetians in 1657, after 
which its use became universal. There are five principal varieties 
of Coffee. The Mocha is considered the best, and is divided in 
three classes namely, the Baouri, which is the best and is hardly 
ever obtainable in this country, as it is reserved for the highest 
classes in Arabia and Turkey; the Saki and the Salabi. The Coffee 
from Martinique, Java, Bio and Guadaloupe, is considered next best 
in quality. The grades from Santa Domingo, Costa Bica, and all 
other kinds, are of inferior qu ility. Coffee is now in use all over 
the civilized world, and is largely adulterated with the chiccory 
root, especially when ground. For this reason Coffee should always 
be procured in beans and ground when required. It will keep its 
flavor better in this way. Adulterated Coffee was first used in 1808, 
during the campaign of Napoleon. The dealers, seeing the large 
profit that could be made by combining chiccory with Coffee, 
adopted it, and even claimed that chiccory improved Coffee, which 
is not so. Most of the ground Coffee now prepared and sold by 
unscrupulous dealers is adulterated with chiccory, ground peas and 
common Coffee beans. Coffee beans are roasted in Coffee roasters 
that can be purchased from dealers. It is better to buy Coffee 
beans in their green state as their quality can then be better distin- 
guished than when roasted. The interior of the Coffee roaster is 
round, and the beans when being turned in the receptacle will roll 
over and over, and thus get evenly roasted on the surface of the hot 
roller. Commence to roast the Coffee over a slow fire, so it Avill be 
gradually and thoroughly browned, which will take place in about 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE. 117 

forty-five minutes. When ifc is browned take it out of the roaster 
and spread it on a blanket. It will then emit an agreeable odor. 
Turn it occasionally to cool it } and when cold put it in jars corked 
tight and grind it when needed. The Mocha Coffee has the best 
flavor, and is generally mixed with Java or Bio. This makes the 
best black Coffee. The Coffee from Martinique and Costa Rica, 
when mixed, is the best to use when milk is added. Coffee when 
ground is made by infusion. French and American coffee pots are 
so well known that no description of them is necessary. Either can 
be used. Coffee should always be made fresh, and care should be 
taken to have the water to the boiling point before it is poured over 
the Coffee. Coffee should not remain long in tin pots, as it 
contains an ingredient that combines with tin or iron, and imparts a 
disagreeable flavor when it lays for any length of time. For this 
reason when large quantities are made at a time it should be kept in 
earthen jars. When Coffee is left over, after a meal, always put it 
in an earthen jar to use the following day. 

Coffee is now made as it Avas years ago. The Orientals do not 
strain it. They boil it with the sugar in and serve it in cups, sus- 
pended below a punctured shell, called fitzyanes. Coffee made and 
served in this manner does not excite the nerves as when made in the 
French or American styles, but the latter modes are considered the 
best. When using a French coffee pot the boiling water has to 
drain through the ground Coffee and runs clear immediately. 
Hence it is unnecessary to clarify it. When it is boiled in a sauce- 
pan and clarified with eggs or other substances, it loses much of its 
strength and flavor. Some physicians advance the theory that 
Coffee is injurious to health, but this is a fallacy, when it is used in 
moderation. A certain gourmet of advanced years, yet in robust 
health, was in the habit of imbibing a cup of Coffee after every 
meal. One evening while at dinner in the Palace Hotel with his 
friend, a well-known physician, the latter remarked casually that 
Coffee was a slow poison, and urged the gourmet to discontinue its 
use. 

"Well," remarked the gourmet, with a sly twinkle in his eye, 
" I agree with you on that point, but I must say that it is terrible 
slow, for I have been using it continuously for the past seventy 
years, and am still alive and well." The doctor then subsided. 

REMARKS ON MIXING COFFEE. 

No. 525. Coffee is easy to make, but must be made with care. 
The principal point is not to have your Coffee beans ground or 
roasted too long before vising, and to always use good Coffee. To 
one pound of Mocha add two pounds of Java, or use one pound 



118 HARDER'S AMERICAN COOKERY. 

of Mocha, one pound of Java, and one pound of Costa Rica or Rio. 
These mixtures make the best Coffee. Coffee is made best in the 
so-called French coffee pots, which are made for large or small 
quantities. AVhen boiling Coffee, the aroma evaporates to a con- 
siderable extent, which does not occur in French c >ffee pots. 
Ground Coffee should never be boiled when it can be done other- 
wise. Always use boiled milk or warm cream with Coffee, as cold 
milk injures the taste of the Coffee. Black Coffee, or cafe noir, 
is always taken after dinner, and should be made stronger than 
breakfast Coffee. It is served with brandy, kirschwasser or rum, 
which is put in the Coffee, or first burnt with sugar, as m&y be 
desired. It is called brulo. It facilitates digestion and excites the 
faculties of the mind. 

COFFEE FOR FAMILY USE. 

No. 526. To make ordinary breakfast Coffee, use four ounces of 
ground Coffee to one quart of boiling water. When using the French 
coffee pot, put the Coffee in the upper vessel with the strainer over 
it. Pour a little of the boiling water over it slowly, and in five 
minutes pour over the rest of the water until it is all in the bottom. 
Keep the pot in a warm place, not letting the Coffee boil. Take 
about three cupfuls of the Coffee out of the bottom and strain it 
through the top again. Repeat this once more, as it makes the 
Coffee stronger, and then it will be ready for use. 

When making Black Coffee for after dinner, use more Coffee or 
less water to make it strong. 

BOILED COFFEE, No. 1. 

No. 527. When no French coffee pot is used, the Coffee must be 
boiled in a saucepan and strained through a double thickness of 
flannel. When making Coffee in large quantities in a saucepan, put 
five pounds of ground Coffee in a saucepan, two fresh raw eggs, and 
a cupful of cold water. Mix it all well together with a wooden 
spoon, and then pour in, slowly at first, five gallons of boiling 
water, stirring it at the same time. Then set it on a brisk fire, and 
as the Coffee rises to the top press it down with a spoon. Let it 
boil up once, and then set it on the side of the fire to keep warm, 
not letting it boil. Drop half a cupful of cold water over the top, 
in drops, and the Coffee will settle immediately. Do this, if in a 
hurry, otherwise it will settle naturally in five or ten minutes. 
Strain it all through a double thickness of flannel, and it is ready 
for use. 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE. 119 

BOILED COFFEE, No. 2. 

No. 528. When using a boiler (in which there is a faucet three 
inches from the bottom, with a fine strainer inside ), and the Coffee 
is made as in No. 1, it need not be strained through flannel. Set 
it on the side of the fire to keep the Coffee warm, and put a piece 
of iron under the boiler to keep it a distance away from the fire. 
Then sprinkle half a cupful of cold water over the top, put the 
cover on tight, and in ten minutes run the Coffee out until it runs 
clear. Then you will pour it back in the boiler. After this it will 
all run perfectly clear if not allowed to boil. 

COFFEE, GERMAN STYLE. 

No. 529. Mix one quart of made Coffee and one quart of boiled 
milk, and boil them together. This will impart a pleasant flavor to 
the Coffee. 

ESSENCE OF COFFEE, FOR CREAMS. 

No. 530. Mix half a pound of Mocha and half a pound of Java, 
and pour over it a pint of boiling water. Cover the saucepan tight 
and let it stand in a warm place for ten minutes. Then strain it 
through a French coffee pot, pouring it through the strainer twice 
again. When cold put the Coffee in bottles, and use it as needed. 

COFFEE ICE. 

No. 531. Take a small cup of Coffee and put it in a tumbler with 
the same quantity of water and a lump of ice. Sweeten it a 
little. This makes a delightful, refreshing summer beverage, which 
will be greatly appreciated at a light luncheon. 



ARTICLE LXIV. 



French COLT'S-FOOT, COMMON. German 

Tussilaye. Huflattich. 

No. 532. This is a hardy, herbaceous perennial plant. The 
leaves are small, radical, roundish and heart-shaped, and from five to 
seven inches in diameter. The plants blossom in February or March, 
before the appearance of the leaves, and often while the ground is 
frozen and covered with snow. The leaves are the parts of the 



120 HARDER' s AMERICAN COOKERY. 

plant used, and are generally cut in July and September. In drying, 
spread them singly in an airy, shaded situation, but do not expose 
them to the sun. They are beneficial in cases of colds and pulmon- 
ary complaints. 

CULTURE. 

No. 533. Colt's Foot thrives best in rich, moist soil. It may be 
propagated from seeds, but is generally cultivated by dividing its 
long, creeping roots. 



ARTICLE LXV. 



French CORIANDER. German 

Coriandre. Kori^nder. 

No. 534. Coriander is a hardy, annual, aromatic plant, that is 
cultivated for its seeds, which have an agreeable taste, and are used 
by confectioners and distillers, and by druggists to disguise the 
taste of medicine. When young, the leaves are used the same as 
chervil. 

CULTURE. 

No. 535. Sow them early in spring. When gathering them for 
the seeds, care should be taken not to bruise the stems or leaves, 
as when bruised they have a disagreeable odor, which is imparted 
to the seeds. They should be gathered on a dry day. 



ARTICLE LXVI. 



CORN POPPY, OR COQUELICOT. 

Ci qiielic<,t. Die Kornroke. 

No. 536^ This is a red flower, which grows wild in corn fields. 
The petals are separated and spread out to dry when they are 
gathered. Separate them if they adhere to each other. When well 
dried, put them in a dark, dry place. They are used for diet drinks 
(tisanes.)

CORN SALAD, OR LAMB LETTUCE. German 

Mache. Li/mmeraalat. 

No. 537. This small salad is used during winter and spring as a 
substitute for lettuce. It is also prepared and cooked the same as 
spinach. The Corn Salad that grows natural is" better than that 
which is cultivated. It is used in salads, and when mixed with 
beets and celery it improves it as a breakfast salad. 

CULTURE. 

No. 538. Sow the seed during August or September, in shallow 
drills about one foot apart. If the soil is dry it should be pressed 
firmly over the seed in order to secure prompt germination. Cover 
them with straw upon the approach of severely cold weather. The 
plants will also do well if grown in spring, and, like most salad 
plants, are greatly improved if grown in very rich soil. The 
ground can scarcely be made too rich for them. In warm weather 
the plants will mature in from four to six weeks. 

CORN SALAD. 

No. 539. Wash the Salad in plenty of cold water. Then drain 
it and put it on a salrad dish and season it with salt, pepper, oil and 
vinegar. Parsley or chives, chopped fine, may bo added if desired. 

CORN SALAD, WITH BEETS. 

No. 540. Prepare the Salad the same as in No. 539. Add some 
cold boiled sliced beets. Handle it carefully. This is a good 
breakfast Salad. 

CORN SALAD, WITH CELERY. 

No. 541. Cut the celery in a small Julienne, and prepare as in 
No. 539. Endives or watercress can also be added.

ARTICLK LXVIII. 



Frcnc!i CORN. Ciernian 

Mais. Mais, or Korn, 

No. 542. The garden variety of Corn for t ible use, is distinct 
from the field Corn variety. It is much relished in this 
country, especially so when used in its fresh state. When dried, it 
is cracked and ground into hominy, of which there are several 
kind-s, which are much used for breakfast, either boiled or fried. 
It is ground into meal (white and yellow), which is used for 
making bread and cakes. It is delicious when used as a mush with 
milk or cream. Corn starch is made from Corn, and is much 
used for custards, cream and various other pastry preparations. 
It is also a healthy nourishment for invalids and infants, and may 
be used for all preparations for which arrow root is used. 

CULTURE. 

No. 543. A rich, warm, alluvial soil is best, and before planting 
it should be as deeply and thoroughly worked as possible. Culti- 
vate it deeply and thoroughly as soon as the plants appear, and 
then every few days until it tassels. Thorough cultivation and 
warm rich soil are the key notes to success. 

EARLY MARBLEHEAD. 

No. 544. This is the best and earliest sweet corn, and is of 
excellent quality. The stalks are short, having many suckers from 
the root. The ears are long, but of medium width, with only a few 
husks. The cob is red and the kernels are small, broad and shallow, 
of a white color, sometimes tinged with red. They must be cooked 
quickly in boiling water, because the red cob will color the grain if 
it is allowed to simmer over a slow fire, or allowed to remain in the 
water after being cooked. 



DOLLY BUTTON. 

No. 545. The stalks are very short, with but few suckers. The 
ears are small and straight and well covered with husks. This is 
the smallest kind in cultivation. 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE. 123 

EXTRA EARLY ADAMS. 

No. 546. Nearly as early as the Dolly Dutton, but inferior in qual- 
ity. Will succeed in the South where others fail. The stalks are

lar variety. The stalks are short and not suckering, bearing one or 
two ears well covered with husks. Ears long, and pointed. Kernels 
very broad, sweet and tender. It does net shrink much in drying. 

EARLY RED NARAGANSETT. 

No 548. One of the best red varieties of sugar corn grown. The 
kernels are much shriveled, and exceedingly sweet and tender. It 
is esteemed as one of the very best table varieties. 

CROSBY'S EXTRA EARLY. 

No 549. A most excellent variety, with ears of large size and 
medium length ; sweet, rich, and delicate. 

RUSSELL'S EARLY PROLIFIC SUGAR. 

No 550. This comes into use a few days after the Crosby, and is 
of excellent quality. It is very productive, and one of the best 
kinds for family use. 

EARLY SWEET SUGAR. 

No. 551. The ears are of good size, tender, and sugary. The 
plant is productive, hearty, and quite early. 

MOORE'S EARLY CONCORD SWEET. 

No. 552. This has large, full ears. The quality is unexcep- 
tionable. It is valuable as an intermediate variety. 

BLACK MEXICAN. 

No. 553. Although the ripe grain is black or bluish-black, the 
corn, when in condition for the table, cooks remarkably white, and 
is surpassed by none -hi tenderness. 



124 HARDER'S AMERICAN COOKERY. 

EXCELSIOR. 

No. 554. This is the best quality of the second early sorts, and 
the best for general crop. Stalks medium, bearing from three to 
six small curved ears, which are filled out to the end with broad, 
white kernels, that cook exceedingly sweet and tender. 

AMBER CREAM. 

No. 555. The stalk is very vigorous. It is very productive, hav- 
ing large ears and long kernels. It is deep, rich, and sugary, 
varying in color from light red to white. 

TRIUMPH. 

No. 556. The stalks are large, with large ears of fine quality. It 
is the earliest of the very large sorts and is highly esteemed for 
canning purposes. 

EGYPTIAN SWEET. 

No. 557. A variety noted for its productiveness ; the stalks 
having from two to four ears each. It is peculiarly adapted for 
canning, and in consequence of its sweetness and tenderness, its 
superiority is noticeable. 

MAMMOTH SWEET. 

No. 558. This variety produces the largest ears of any sort, a 
single ear weighing from two to three pounds. The quality is excel- 
lent, sweet, tender, and delicious. For family use it cannot be 
excelled. 

STOWELL'S EVERGREEN SWEET. 

No. 559. This variety is intermediate in its season, and if planted 
at the same time as the early kinds, will keep the table supplied 
until October. It is hardy and productive, very tender and sugary. 

BURLINGTON EARLY ADAMS. 

No. 560. An excellent early field variety, and often used for the 
table, particularly in the South. Ears eight inches long, with 
twelve or fourteen rows. The kernels are white and rounded, some- 
what deeper than broad, and indented at the outer end, which is 
whiter and less transparent than the inner. 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE. 125 

EARLY CANADA. 

No. 561. A very early, yellow variety, much grown in Canada, 
and good for localities where the seasons are short, or where first 
planting has failed. 

LACKAWAXEN. 

No. 562. This i-i a white flint, eight-rowed variety, with very large 
and deep grains. There are usually two ears to a stalk. It completes 
its growth in ninety-five days, and is considered very prolific. 

EARLY WHITE FLINT. 

No. 563. This is an excellent, productive variety, with ears of 
good size, pearly white, and of a beautiful appearance. Much used 
for making hominy. 

LARGE RED BLAZED, EIGHT-ROWED. 

No. 564. An excellent variety for field culture, with large ears, 
well filled out at the top and end. Its color is yellow, splashed 
with red at the point. 

EARLY GOLDEN DENT. 

No. 565. This is a variety as early as the flint sorts, and is highly 
recommended for general use. The stalks are of medium size, with 
very broad leaves. The ears are short and are always filled to the 
point. The cob is small, and the kernels are long and yellow. It 
makes a good meal. 

CHESTER COUNTY MAMMOTH. 

No. 566. A large, late variety, very popular in Pennsylvania. A 
sure and hardy cropper, but will not mature well in the extreme 
Northern States. It is one of the best of the Dent varieties. The 
stalk is large, bearing one or two very large ears. Kernels narrow, 
very long, and deep yellow. Cob very small. 

BLUNT' s PROLIFIC. 

No. 567. This is one of the most prolific varieties grown. The 
ears are short and well shaped, averaging three, and frequently 
running as high as eight to a stalk. The kernel is white, of the 
general form of the Dent variety, but harder, and makes an extra 
quality of pure, white meal. It is not early, and will not do well at 
the extreme North. 



126 HARDER'S AMERICAN COOKERY. 

RICE CORN, FOR PARCHING. 

No. 568. This is a very handsome variety, that is exceedingly 
prolific, and is used entirely for parching, being superior to all 
others for this purpose. The ears are short and the kernels are 
long, pointed and white, resembling rice in appearance. 

BOILED GREEN CORN. 

No. 569. Take the husks off of the Corn, break off the stem, 
remove all the threads and the upper end. Put them to boil in 
boiling water, lightly salted, and let them boil until tender. Serve 
in a napkin with butter, separately. 

NOTE. When the Corn is to be kept for some little time after it is cooked, it is always best to add 
some boiled milk to the water. 

CORN, WITH MILK OR CREAM. 

No. 570. When the Corn is boiled as in No. 569, cut the Corn 
from the ear, put it into a saucepan, moistened with milk or cream, 
seasion with salt and pepper, and when the moisture is nearly re- 
duced, add a piece of butter, tossing it over well until the butter is 
melted. Then serve it. 

STEWED GREEN CORN. 

No. 571. Cut the grains from six ears of Corn, put them into a 
saucepan with a quart of boiling water and cook for twenty min- 
utes. Then drain off most of the water and add half a pint of milk. 
Season with salt and pepper and add an ounce of butter, with which 
mix a teaspoonful of flour. Stir the Corn until the butter is dis- 
solved, and let it simmer for fifteen minutes. 

CORN, WITH BEANS. 

No. 572. When the Corn is boiled as in No. 569, cut it from the 
ears and add one-half or quarter of its quantity of string beans, cut 
in diamond shape, or green flageolet beans, cooked separately. 
Season with salt and pepper, moisten with a little milk or cream, 
and when thoroughly warmed add a piece of butter. 

SUCCOTASH. 

No. 573. Succotash is made with Corn and small Lima beans, 
using two parts of Corn to one part of beans. Cut the grain off of '< 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE. 127 

one dozen ears of Corn, and shell the beans. Put them in a sauce- 
pan with sufficient boiling water to cover them, add a little salt and 
cook them until they are tender. Then drain off half of the moist- 
ure and add the same quantity of boiled milk. Knead a spoonful 
of flour in a piece of butter and add it with the milk. Let it all 
simmer for twenty minutes, stirring it occasionally, so that the 
mixture will not adhere to the bottom of the saucepan. Season it 
with salt and pepper. 

NJTE. Green flageolet or string beans may be used instead of Lima beans, the string beans 
should be cut in pieces, one inch long. 

CORN, WITH TOMATOES. 

No. 57-4. Cut the grains from one dozen ears of Corn and put 
them into a saucepan with an equal quantity of peeled tomatoes cut 
into square pieces. Let them cook until the tomatoes are well 
cooked and 'the moisture nearly reduced. Season them with salt 
and pepper, and before serving add a piece of butter. 

CORN FRITTERS. 

Fo. 575. Cut the grains from six ears of Corn and put them into 
a saucepan, moistening them with a little cream, and season with 
salt, pepper and a pinch of sugar. Let it all simmer until reduced 
of its moisture, then set it off of the fire to cool. Make a batter 
with two spoonfuls of flour, milk and eggs not too thin. Add it 
to the Corn, mixing it well. Have in a frying pan some hot lard. 
Then fill a soup-spoon with the Corn batter and drop it into the lard 
(not too much at a time). Fry them until nicely browned on both 
sides, drain them on a napkin and serve them with fried parsley to 
garnish. 

NOTE. When using a batter like that used in Queen fritters, it will make the fritters more 
delicious. 

GREEN CORN CAKES. 

No. 576. Grate the corn from one dozen ears and put it into a 
bowl, adding one pint of milk, four ounces of melted butter and six 
raw eggs. Mix the whole well together. Season to taste and add 
flour enough to make a light batter. Bake the same as you would 
buckwheat or Corn cake. 

CANNED CORN, HOW TO PREPARE. 

No. 577. Canned corn may be had of all grocers the whole year 
round. Open the can, put the corn into a saucepan and moisten

piece of butter, tossing it well over until the butter is melted. Serve 
hot. 

NOTE. Any of the preparations given above for green corn, may also be made of canned corn. 

ROASTED CORN. 

No. 578. Turn back the husk, pick out the silk threads, re-cover 
the ear with the husk, and roast it in the hot ashes of a wood fire. 
Serve it with butter, salt and pepper. An excellent and easy mode 
of cooking corn for campers. 

SOUP CREAM OF CORN. 

No. 579. Cut the grains from one dozen good-sized ears of corn. 
Put them into a saucepan to cook, with three pints of boiling 
water, one onion, a faggot of celery, and a leek. Season witli salt, 
pepper, nutmeg, and a pinch of sugar. When the corn is cooked 
add two quarts of cream sauce. Let it simmer for fifteen minutes, 
then remove the onion and faggot, add a piece of butter, and serve 
hot. 

NoTa. The soup, when prepared as above, may be rubbed through a fine sieve, then put back into 
a saucepan, to keep warm, and before serving add half a pint of cream, into which dilute the yolks of 
six raw eggs. Put into a soup tureen some fine chopped parsley or chives, and on this pour the 
soup. 

CORN CHOWDER. 

No. 580. Cut one pound of fat pork in small pieces, and put them 
in a saucepan. When they are nicely fried remove the pieces and 
put four finely sliced onions in the hot fat. When they are fried, 
add one gallon of hot water, letting it boil until the onions are 
thoroughly cooked, when you will rub it through a fine sieve. Then 
peel one dozen potatoes, slice them fine, and cut the same quantity 
of green corn from the cob. Put them in a saucepan, in layers, 
sprinkle each layer lightly with flour, and sen son with salt and 
pepper. Then pour the above strained broth over the layers, cover 
the saucepan and set on the fire to boil for thirty minutes. By this 
time the corn and potatoes should be cooked. Then add one 
quart of boiled milk, a piece of butter and some crackers, split in 
half and soaked in cold water. Pat the cover on the saucepan and 
cook the chowder ten minutes longer. 

HULLED CORN. 

No. 581. Hulled corn can be procured from dealers, and is best 
during the fall and winter. Its attractiveness lays in its snowy white- 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OP TASTE. 129 

ness. Put the quantity desired into a saucepan, with milk to cover, 
set it on the fire and season it lightly, with salt only. Let it simmer 
slowly. Care must be taken not to let it scorch, and when it is 
cooked add a good sized piece of butter. Serve separately with a 

pitcher of cream and a bowl of sugar. 



BOILED COARSE HOMINY. 

No. 582. Soak the Hominy in cold water over night, and in the 
morning drain off the water and put the Hominy into a saucepan 
with fresh water. Let it cook slowly, and occasionally stir it with 
a wooden spoon. Season it with salt, and when cooked drain it in 
a colander. Then put it back into the saucepan and season it with 
salt and white, pepper, and add a good sized piece of butter. Then 
stir the Hominy with a wooden spoon until the butter is melted, and 
moisten it with a little hot milk or cream. 

NOTE. This Hominy may be served as a dinner vegetable, or with cream and sugar. 

i 

FINE HOMINY. 

No. 583. Fine Hominy is mostly used for breakfast and luncheon, 
and a pot of cream ought always to be served with it. 

Soak two pounds of Hominy over night, and when it is ready to 
cook, have in a saucepan six quarts of boiling water, lightly salted, 
into which put the Hominy slowly, while stirring it with a wooden 
spoon. Let it boil slowly, occasionally stirring it from the bottom, 
until it is well cooked, and when cooked it should be similar to 
mush. If found too thick, add a little more hot water or milk, and 
serve with butter, cream and sugar. 

FRIED HOMINY. 

No. 584. Cook the Hominy as in No. 583, only have it thicker. 
When it is well cooked put it into square, buttered pans, about two 
inches thick, and set it aside to get cold. When cold, cut the 
Hominy in slices and dip them into beaten eggs, diluted with a little 
milk. Then Hour them and fry them in clarified butter. It is 
occasionally served with roast wild ducks. 

HOMINY CROQUETTES, 

No. 585. Put into a saucepan one pound of hot boiled Hominy. 

Stir it off the fire until nearly cold, and be very careful to have no 

lumps. Add a piece of butter, sweeten to taste, and add the yolks 

of four raw eggs. Have the whole well mixed, then roll them on

the table into croquettes, then dip into beaten eggs and then into- 
fresh bread crumbs. Shape them nicely and fry in hot lard. 

BAKED HOMINY. 

No. 586. Put into a saucepan one pound of hot-boiled Hominy, 
stirring it until nearly cold. Then add two ounces of butter and 
the yolks of six raw eggs. When the whole is well mixed, add in 
slowly half a pint of cold milk and sweeten it to taste. Then beat 
the whites of four eggs into a stiff froth, and mix the froth gently 
into the Hominy. Then put it into deep, buttered dishes, and bake 
gently until nicely browned. 

CORN MEAL. 

No. 587. Corn Meal is finely ground corn, it is also called Indian 
Meal. There are two kinds of Corn Meal, the white and the yellow. 
The -best variety of white Corn Meal is made from Blunt' s prolific 
corn, and the best variety of the yellow is made from the Golden 
Dent variety. Mush is generally made from the latter kind. Corn 
Meal is also used for making a great variety of bread and cakes, 
which will be fully described in the Book on Pastry. It is also 
used for making gruels, soups, etc., for infants and invalids, as it 
is considered very nutritious and healthful. 

BOILED MUSH. 

No. 588. Have in a saucepan four quarts of boiling water. 
Season it with a spoonful' of salt. Pour into the water slowly three- 
pounds of the Corn Meal, stirring it slowly with a wooden spoon 
until it thickens. Then set it on the side of the fire to cook slowly, 
occasionally stirring it well up until it is well cooked. When 
cooked, serve it with fresh butter, cream or milk. 

NOTE. This can be made of yellow or white Meal; the yellow is, however, generally preferred. 

FRIED MUSH. 

No. 589. ^-Prepare a Mush as in No. 588, and when it is cooked 
add a piece of butter and mix it well. Then pour the Mush into a 
buttered, square pan, about two inches thick. Cover this with a 
buttered paper, so as to prevent the Mush from having a crust, and 
when cold cut it into slices a quarter of an inch thick. Then dip 
the slices into beaten eggs, and after flouring them, fry them in 
clarified butter. Drain, and serve them on a napkin. 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE, 131 

CORN MEAL GEUEL. 

No. 590. Have in a saucepan two quarts of boiling water, and 
while the water boils drop into it half a pound of Corn Meal, 
stirring it with a wooden spoon until it boils steadily. Then set it 
on the side of the fire to boil slowly for one hour. Season it with a 
little salt. A little wheat flour may be added, while cooking, and 
it may also be sweetened with a pinch of sugar and a little nutmeg. 
This may be served as it is, or may be strained and may be cooked 
with milk or broth. 

POULAINTA, OE CORN MEAL WITH CHEESE. 

No. 591. Poulainta is an Italian preparation, which is nourishing 
and healthful, and is used by the Italians as we use corn meal mush. 
Put two quarts of water in a saucepan, and when it boils add salt 
and a piece of butter. Then put the Corn Meal in slowly, stirring 
it all the time (so it will not get lumpy), until it commences to 
thicken. Then set it on the side of the fire to cook slowly, stirring 
it up from the bottom occasionally. When it is cooked add half a 
pound of grated Parmesan cheese, and a piece*of butter, mix it well 
together. Serve in a large dish, with a beef gravy reduced with 
Tomato sauce and flavored with the essence of dry mushrooms. 
Serve a tureen of consomme with it. 

POULAINTA, WITH GAME. 

No. 592. Prepare the Poulainta as in No. 591, and when it is 
cooked put it on a large dish, making a hollow space in the center. 
(Prepare, separately, two dozen reed birds.) Put the birds in a 
frying-pan with a piece of butter, toss them over the fire, and when 
nearly cooked add some fine herbs, and then cook them thoroughly. 
Put the birds in the center of the Poulainta. Put a few spoonfuls of 
gravy in the pan, let it boil up once, and then pour it over the birds. 

CRUSTS OF POULAINTA, MILANAISE STYLE. 

No. 593. Cook one pound of yellow Corn Meal in six pints of 
water, the same as in No. 591. Keep it stiff, and when cooked add 
six ounces of butter and four ounces of grated Parmesan cheese. Mix 
it all well and put it in a buttered tin pan, about two inches deep. 
When it is cold, turn the mush out of the pan and cut it with a 
round cutter into pieces, about the size of a dollar in circum- 
ference. With a smaller cutter make an impression on the 
top of each piece, and then fry them in hot lard. When nicely

colored drain them. Then take the cover off of each, and hollow 
out the center, not breaking the crust, and set them in the oven 
to dry. 

Put the yolks of five raw eggs in a saucepan, dilute them with half a 
pint of cream. Add one-quarter of a pound of Gruyere or American 
cheese, cut in small, thin pieces,' and a pinch of nutmeg. Set it on 
the fire and stir it with a small whisk until the cheese is melted. 
Then add one-quarter of a pound of grated cheese, and keep stirring 
it until melted. Do not let it boil. Fill the crusts with the prepara- 
tion and serve them hot.

CORN GRIDDLE CAKES COMMON CORN CAKES. 

No. 594. Put into a bowl one quart of sour or buttermilk, one 
tablespoonful of soda, a little salt, and add enough flour to make a 
nice batter. Bake immediately. 

BATTER CAKES. 

No. 595. To one quart of milk add enough white Corn Meal, with 
one handful of wheat flour, to make a light batter. Put with this 
four spoonfuls of yeast and a little salt, and when it is all well mixed 
gather it together and cover it with a cloth, so as to let it raise over 
night. In the morning add one ounce of melted butter and a tea- 
spoonful of soda, dissolved in hot water. Mix well together and 
then bake. 

FLANNEL CAKES. 

No. 596. To one quart of milk add enough Corn Meal to make a 
light batter. Put with this four spoonfuls of yeast and a little salt. 
When it is well mixed cover it with a cloth to raise it over night. 
In the morning add an ounce of melted butter and four well beaten 
eggs. Mix them well together and then bake. 

FLAP JACKS, OR TRIMMED LACE. 

No. 597. Put into a bowl one pound of Corn flour. Make a

spoonfuls of molasses or brown sugar. With this put one quart of 
hot milk, mix it together, and cover it with a cloth and let it stand 
in a warm temperature overnight. In the morning add the yolks of 
four raw eggs, four ounces of wheat flour and a little salt. Mix 
them well up, and if the batter should be too thick add a little cold 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE. 133 

milk. Then add in, gently, the whites of the eggs (beaten to a stiff 
froth), and bake. 

CORN STARCH. 

No. 598. Com Starch is the fecula of Corn, and is used for all 
the purposes for which arrow root is used in cooking. It is also 
much preferable to arrow root for alimentary purposes. It is used 
in creams, custards, blanc mange, and a numberless variety of cakes 
and fritters. It is also delicious for thickening certain soups and 
sauces, instead of flour, as it keeps them clear and transparent. 
Though many preparations made with Corn Starch are not as succu- 
lent as when made in their original styles, especially will this be 
found to be the case with creams, blanc mange, etc. It often 
happens that when articles are made of Corn Starch which are too 
stiff, or which are not well cooked, they retain a starchy taste. It 
is very nutritious for infants and invalids, when boiled in milk or 
made into custards. The recipes will be found in their respective 
places in the Books on Soups, Sauces and Pastries.

No. 600. The Romaine, or Cos L >ttuce, of which there are sev- 
eral varieties, is one of the most crisp and refreshing salads grown. 
(See article on Lettuce.) Its leaves are long, narrow and of a dark 



134 HARDER'S AMERICAN COOKERY. 

green color. It stands the heat well, and should be tied up to 
blanch a week or ten days before cutting. It is used as a salad the 
same as ordinary lettuce, and is also boiled and prepared in the 
same way as spinach. It is braised and stuffed the same as lettuce. 



ARTICLE LXXI. 



French COSTMARY, OR ALECOST. German 

Tannisie Barbodine. Frauenmunze. 

No. 601. Costmary is a hardy perennial plant with a creeping 
root, and an erect, branching stem from two to three feet in height. 
The radical leaves, which are produced on long footstalks, are oval, 
serrated and of a grayish color. Those of the stalks are smaller 
than the radical ones but similar in form. The plant has a soft, 
agreeable odor, and is sometimes used as a pot herb for flavoring 
soups. The leaves are used in salads and also for flavoring ale or 
beer. 

CULTURE. 

No. 602. Costmary may be cultivated in almost any soil. It is 
generally propagated by dividing the roots, which increase rapidly. 
It should be planted in spring or autumn. Set them two feet apart 
in each direction. 



ARTICLE LXXI I. 



CRANBERRY. 

Canneberge. Moosbeere. 

No. 603. The Cranberry is a trailing shrub, which grows wild 
in swampy meadows and on the borders of inland lakes. It can be 
improved, however, by planting in any moist soil that is thoroughly 
manured with decayed manure. When cultivated in this way the 
berries will be larger and of better flavor, and the yield will be 
more abundant. The berries are round, of a reddish color, and 
have an aciduous flavor. There are several varieties. The bell- 
shaped is the largest, having a dark-red color. The cherry variety 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE. 135 

comes both large and small, the large kind being preferred. The 
color is dark-red, and it is considered next in excellence to the 
bell-shaped. The oval or egg-shaped Cranberry comes large and 
small also. It is a good variety, but not as profitable as the others. 

CULTURE. 

No. 604. Procure the plants with their natural earth and plant 
them earlj- in spring, four feet apart, in moist sandy soil, well 
manured. 

CRANBERRY SAUCE. 

No. 605. Pick one pound of Cranberries and wash them in cold 
water. Put them in a copper basin with a glassful of water and 
cook them over a brisk fire. Sweeten with sugar stirred in with a 
wooden spoon until the} r are like a marmalade. Then strain them 
through a fine sieve and put them in an earthen jar. The sauce is 
used with turkey and for tarts and pies. If Cranberries are cooked 
in tin basins they will not keep their rich red color. 



LXXITI. 



French CRESS, OR PEPPER GRASS. German 

Cress'm. Pillenfarn. 

No. 606. Cress, or Pepper Grass, is a pungent salad, and is 
mostly used in mixing with other salads. Mixed with fine herbs it 
has a piquant, agreeable taste, and it should always be used when 
young and freshly plucked. It gives a most agree vble taste to all 
green salads. 

CULTURE. 

No. 607. The seed should be sown in drills about eighteen inches 
apart on very rich ground, and the plants Avell cultivated. Keep oft' 
insects by dusting with Pyrethruni powder. It may be planted 
very early. Continue sowing every week, as it matures very 
rapidly and runs to seed. 

The fine curled Cress is very superior, and will bear cutting sev- 
eral times. The Perennial American resembles the water Cress, 
and may be cut several times. 

The Garden Broad Leaved has a mild flavor and is generally used 
in soups.

French GARDEN CRESS. German 

Cressun alenois des jardiiis. Kresse. 

No. 608. This is one of the best plants in cultivation for herbs, 
and can be easily raised in pots or boxes. It runs quickly into 
seed and withers as soon as plucked so for this reason it is rarely 
found in the markets. It is an excellent ingredient for salads, hav- 
ing a mild, piquant taste. The leaves should never be chopped, 
but are plucked or served in bunches. The leaves when laid 
between buttered sandwiches and eaten with eggs, make a relish 
highly esteemed by epicures. 



ARTICLE LXXV. 



WATER CRESS. 

Cresson de Fontaine. Brwmen- Kresse. 

No. 609. The Water Cress is a hardy, perennial, aquatic plant, 
growing abundantly along the margins of running streams, ditches 
and ponds. It is very easily introduced by planting it along the 
margins of ponds and streams where it does not already grow, and 
will increase both by the spreading of the roots and seeding. 

It has a particularly pleasant, pungent taste, and is agreeable to 
nearly every one. It is also one of the most delicious small salads. 

CULTURE. ' 

No. 610. The seeds should be sown and lightly covered in grav- 
elly, murky lands, along the border of small, rapid streams. They 
will need no subsequent culture, as in favorable conditions they 
increase very rapidly by self-sowing of seed and extension of roots. 
Good beds should be fenced in to keep animals from trampling on 
them, and should also be kept clear of wild herbs. 

ITS USE. 

No. 611. It is eaten as a morning salad, and should only be used 
when fresh. It should be washed well in cold water and then 
drained. (Care must be taken not to bruise or press it.) Then 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE. 137 

add a little vinegar, salt and pepper. It is also mixed with other 
green salads, and is largely used for garnishing roast chickens, 
steaks, etc. It can also be cooked and prepared the same as 
spinach. 



ARTICLE: LXXVI. 



French CUCUMBER. German 

Cuncombie, Gurke. 

No. 612. There are many varieties of Cucumbers. They are 
eaten raw and are also cooked in various ways. When used in salads 
they should be sliced very fine and sprinkled with salt to drain them 
of the water, otherwise they are apt to cause indigestion. It is a 
vegetable that can be grown to perfection by any one who controls 
a few square yards of soil which is fully exposed to the sun the 
fruit being so very much better when gathered from the vine than 
when procured in the market. Some varieties are used for cooking 
purposes and some for pickling, and are then called pickles, or 
gherkins. 

CULTURE. 

No. 613. The plants are tender, and planting should be delayed 
until settled warm weather or ample facilities are provided to pro- 
tect them from frost and during cold storms. Form low, flat hills, 
six feet apart each way, of rich soil, by mixing in a quantity of 
thoroughly decomposed manure, stirring the soil to a depth of 
sixteen inches or more. Scatter one seed every inch along the rows, 
and cover them one inch deep, pressing the soil over them. As 
soon as the plants are up they will be liable to attack by the striped 
cucumber beetle. These may be kept off by frequent dusting with 
air-slacked lime. Care should be taken not to use too much lime, 
for if too strong it will kill the vines. ' When the plants are well 
established, thin to three plants to each hill. In gathering, pick 
all the fruit before it begins to ripen, as the vines will cease setting 
fruit as soon as any seed commences to mature. In gathering for 
pickles cut the stem instead of pulling the fruit off, and be careful 
not to mar the fruit in any way, for if the skin is broken the pickles 
will not keep. 

EARLY WHITE SPINE. 

No. 614. A favorite market variety, of medium size, with deep 
green flesh, crisp and of fine flavor.

color, firm and crisp. 

Talby's Hybrid, the Long Green Turkey, and the Short Green, 
are considered excellent varieties for family use. 

ENGLISH FEAME OE FORCING VAEIETIES. 

No. 622. These are almost exclusively raised for self-gratification, 
and are grown in hot-houses. Sow them in small pots in January, 
February or March, in a hot-bed or hot-house, and when grown to 
three leaves plant them out in previously prepared hills of loose 
rich soil in the center of he sash. Keep a temperature of sixty- 
five degrees at night, to seventy or eighty degrees with sun heat. 
When grown under glass artificial impregnation of the flowers is 
necessary, by the usual method of using a camel's-hair pencil, or if

not a hive of bees should be kept, if Cucumbers are grown on a 
large scale in green-houses. When grown in the open air there is 
no need of this, as the insects and winds effect impregnation. The 
following selections include some of the leading English varieties:

top of which place some heavy weight to press the Cucumbers 
clown. Keep them in a cool place for six weeks, and occasionally 
stir them from the bottom. 

When ready to put them up, drain off the brine and throw away 
any of the Cucumbers that may have become softened. Put the 
good Cucumbers into fresh cold water over night. Drain the 
quantity you need and put them into a copper basin, lined with

French CUCKOO-FLOWER CRESS. German 

Cresson Elegant des pres. Kuckuksblume. 

No. 644. This is a hardy, perennial plant, that is grown in the 
Northern and Southern States. The stem is about fifteen inches 
high, being erect and smooth. The leaves are deeply divided and 
have a warm, pungent taste, such as is always noticeable in the 
Cress family. They are used when youn'g as a salad, the same as 
other cresses. Medicinally it has the reputation of being highly 
anti-scorbutic, and it also aids digestion. There are four varieties : 
the white flowering, the purple flowering, the double white flower- 
ing, and the double purple flowering. The last two varieties are 
propagated by a division of the roots. The single varieties are 
propagated from seed, which is sown in April, in shallow drills, one 
foot apart. The roots may be divided in spring or autumn.

CUMIN. 

Gamin. KummeL 

No. 645. Cumin, though a native of Egypt, may be successfully 
grown in the Southern or Middle States. The plant is cultivated 
for its seed, which is carminative and is used the same as caraway 
and coriander, and for flavoring a liqueur called Kummel. It 
is a tender, annual plant. Its seeds are long and furrowed, 
and of a pale brownish color. It requires a light, warm, loamy soil. 
Sow in May in drills fourteen inches apart and half an inch deep. 
When the plants are well up trim them to three inches apart in the

many spurious imitations made here that are composed of ground 
red and black pepper, curcuma, cloves, nutmeg and ginger, and 
which are far inferior in quality to the genuine article; in fact, they 
hardly resemble it. Preparations in which Curry is a component 
part should always be accompanied by a dish of rice.

French DANDELION. Gcrmau 

Pisse en lit. Loicenzahn. 

No. 647. Those who only know the Dandelion as the persistent 
weed in pastures and lawns (which is gathered for salads when 
young and green), know no more of its real value than one who has 
only seen the poisonous wild parsnip or carrot knows of the value 
of those vegetables. The improved variety makes it one of the ear- 
liest and best greens in cultivation. It is a hardy perennial plant, 
resembling the endive, and affords one of the best and most health- 
ful of spring salads. 

CULTURE. 

No. 648. When cultivated the ^eeds should be sown in May or 
June, in drills half an inch deep and twelve inches apart. The 
plants will be ready for use the following spring. It is also exten- 
sively grown for its roots. For this purpose it is sown in Septem- 
ber and cultivated well during the fall, and in the following season 
the roots will be fit to dig up in October. The roots, after being 
dried, constitute an article of commercial importance, being exten- 
sively employed as a substitute for, or mixed with coffee. 

LARGE LEAVED DANDELION (CULTIVATED). 

No. 649. When cultivated its leaves are fully double the size of 
the common Dandelion. It is a great improvement over the com- 
mon variety, and when blanched it can be prepared in every way, 
the same as the endive. 

DANDELION SALAD.

DIET DRINKS (Tisanes). 

Tisane. Difit Getriinke. 

No. 654. It is the duty of every chief cook to know how to com- 
pound and prepare diet drinks, juleps and apozems. Diet drinks, 
or tisanes, are made for sick persons, to be taken as a refreshment. 
They should be prepared in such a manner that the taste will be 
agreeable to the patient. In making diet drinks it is best to use 
earthen pots. They should not be allowed to draw more than half 
an hour or they will get too strong and bitter. When flowers, 
leaves or herbs are used, diet drinks are made by infusion; when 
roots are used, they are boiled. 

The following are the principal plants, roots, flowers, herbs and 
seeds from which diet drinks are made:

DECOCTION OF MALT. 



No. 655. Malt is barley or other grain steeped in water till it 
germinates, and then dried in a kiln, thus evolving the saccharine 
principle. The decoction of malt makes an emollient diet drink of 
agreeable taste, which is nourishing to a small degree. 



HERB JUICE. 

No. 656. Herb juice is made by combining a variety of herbs 
and vegetables, such as the endive, water cress, lettuce, chervil, 
sorrel and white beet. Use equal parts of the herbs or vegetables 
desired and pound them in a mortar into a fine, homogeneous paste. 
Then press out or extract the juice. Mix four or five ounces of it 
in a cup of veal or chicken broth and drink it before breakfast. A 
spoonful of lime syrup may be added to it. This is a drink that 
will cleanse the system well.

ICELAND MOSS, OR LICHEN DIET DRINK. 

No. 657. Put one ounce of Iceland Moss or Lichen into one 
pound of water, to macerate for twelve hours. Then drain off the 
water and put the Moss to boil in three pounds of fresh water, letting 
it boil until one-third of the quantity of water is reduced. Then 
strain it through a napkin and add one ounce of marsh mallow syrup. 
This is an emollient drink, and is frequently used for complaints 
relative to the chest or breast, and for affections of the larynx. It 
would be advisable to dilute this with one-third of its quantity of 
cow's milk, if the stomach can stand it. 

COLT'S-FOOT DIET DRINK. 

No. 658. Put half an ounce of Colt's-foot roots in a pint of water, 
and let it boil a few minutes. Then take it from the fire and add 
two pinches of Colt's-foot flower. It should be taken at regular inter- 
vals. It may be mixed with wine instead of water, if taken at 
dinner. 

AN ANTI-BILIOUS DIET DRINK. 

No. 659. Take half a handful of barley heads having long beards 
or arms, and put them in a pint of water. Let it boil awhile and 
then add two rennet apples, peeled and cut in quarters. Then strain 
it through a napkin and add four ounces of vinegar syrup and the 
juice of two lemons. It is then ready for use. 

AN EMOLLIENT DIET DRINK. 

No. 660. Put a handful of mallow flowers and two ounces of 
Canadian venus-hair in a pint of boiling water and let it steep.

ounces of dried currants. Put them in a pint of water to boil. 
When boiled strain them through a towel and add one ounce of gum 
or marsh mallow syrup. It is then ready for use. 

Another pectoral diet drink can be made as follows : Make a de- 
coction of rennet apples, after which add to it equal proportions of 
violet flowers, colt's-foot, mallow and mullen. Sweeten it with honey 
and strain it through a fine hair sieve. It is then ready for use. 



150 HAEDER'S AMERICAN COOKERY. 

APOZEMS. 

No. 662. Apozems are concentrated tisanes with medicinal and 
pharrnaceutic preparation, and should be made by infusion or de- 
coction. The- ingredients should be macerated or ground to a 
powder, as the case may be. Apozems used for cleansing the sys- 
tem have sarsaparilla or burdock as a basis. The stiptic, diuretic, 
purgative and the febrifuge Apozcms should be made only from a 
physician's prescription, as should any others that are intended for 
internal use. They can be made with convenience to use as lotions, 
gargles or injections. The method of cooking them and the mode 
of application must be thoroughly understood. 

NOTE. Use the apothecaries' weight in weighing mixtures. 

A DIURETIC OR APERIENT APOZEM. 

No. 663. Take four drams of wild horseradish, and two drams of 
crushed juniper berries. Put them in a pot. Pour twelve ounces

strain it through a piece of flannel and let it stand. When it is 
cold add a pint of white wine, in which you have dissolved two 
ounces of vinegar, honey and syrup of squills mixed in equal 
quantities. This Apozem is used in cases of gravel or when the 
flow of urine is embarrassed. Take three wine glasses full in the 
morning before breakfast. 

A VERMIFUGE APOZEM. 

No. 664. Take one ounce of Corsican sea moss and one ounce of 
Artemesia syrup and put them in eight ounces of boiling water to 
steep. This Apozem is appropriate for children having worms. 
Grown persons who have the solitary worm use a decoction of pom- 
egranate roots, which is an efficient remedy. 

AN ANTI-SCORBUTIC APOZEM. 

$ 

No. 665. Take a handful of menyanthes leaves, one of sorrel 
leaves and one of horseradish roots. Put them in four pounds of 
water and boil it until the quantity of water is reduced one-half. 
This is an excellent remedy in cases of scurvy. 

AN ASTRINGENT APOZEM. 

No. 666. Take two drams of catechu and two drams of comfrey 
roots. Boil them in one quart of water, and when reduced to one-

Trench EGG PLANT. German 

Aubergine. Eierpflanze. 

No. 670. The Egg Plant is a tender, annual plant, that origin- 
ated in South America. When well grown and properly cooked, it 
is a delicious table vegetable. Its fruit resembles a large egg in 
shape. There are two varieties, the white and the violet. 



152 HARDER'S AMERICAN COOKERY, 

CULTURE. 

No. 671. The seed germinates slowly and should be started in 
strong heat, for in this, as in all tropical plants, it is of import- 
ance to secure a rapid and continuous growth from the first, the 
plants never recovering from a check received when young. When 
the plants have formed two rough leaves, transplant them to four 
inches apart, keep the bed closed and very warm, shaded from the 
direct rays of the sun, and giving them an abundance of water until 
the ground is warm and all danger, not only from frost but from 
cold nights, is past. Then harden off the plants by gradual exposure 
to the sun and air, and decrease the supply of water. Then care- 
fully transplant them into warm, rich soil, setting the plants two 
and one-half feet apart. If needed shade the young plants and 
protect them from the potatoe bug, which is very fond of them, and 
if not prevented will soon destroy the young plants. 

EARLY LONG PURPLE.

ELDERBERRIES. 

Graine de Surreau. Hollunderbeere. 

No. 691. The Elderberry tree is found in all parts of this 
country, the flowery buds and fruit being used. The flowery buds 
are used for diet drinks. Pick them in bunches in the morning, 
before the rising of the sun, put them in a wooden tub and cover it 
with a blanket. When the heat will have expanded them, pick off 
the flowers, spread them out on a table, and when perfectly dry, 
put them in boxes, and keep them in a dry, dark place. The 
berries when ripe are used for making and coloring red wine. 

ELDERBERRY CATSUP.

Frci . c!l ELECAMPANE. German 

Aunie. Alantwurzel. 

No. 693. Is a hardy, herbaceous, perennial plant, growing spon- 
taneously in moist places and in the vicinity of gardens where it 
has once been cultivated. The stem is from three to five feet high, 
thick and strong, branching towards the top. The leaves are from 
nine inches to one foot in length, oval-toothed on the margin, and 
downy below. The flower resembles a small sunflower, and is 
general propagated by dividing the roots, but may be grown from 
seeds, which are sown just after ripening. Elecampane is cultivated 
for its roots, which are carminative, sudorific, tonic, and alleviating 
in pulmonary diseases. They are in perfection when of two years' 
growth.

ENDIVE, OR CHICOREE. 

Chicorea ou Scarole. Endive, or Cichorie. 

No, 694. The Endive, in its natural state, is very bitter, but when 
properly blanched its leaves make a fine salad, and coming as it 
does, after the Lettuce, it is very useful for autumn and winter 
salad. There are two special kinds, of which there are ten 
different varieties. The Wild Chicoree, known as the Dandelion, 
is mostly eaten in salad when young and tender. The cultivated 
Endive (broad leaf) is u*ed as a vegetable, and is prepared the 
same as spinach. 

CULTURE. 

No. 695. It may be grown at any season of the year, but is 
generally used late in the fall. Sow the seed during June or July, 
in drills fourteen inches apart, and when well up thin the plants to 
one foot apart. "When nearly full grown tie the outer leaves 
together over the centre, in order to blanch the heart of the plant. 
They will usually be fit for the table in ten days, and will continue 
in condition for use for about one week, so that the tieing up should 
be done every few days, in order to secure a succession.

off the three outer hard layers of green leaves, trim the edges of 
the others, cut off the roots and wash the heads in plenty of cold 
water. Separate the leaves, as there are liable to be small worms 
in them, and then drain them. Have some lightly salted boiling- 
water in a saucepan. Put in the Endives, let them cook until ten- 
der and then immerse them in cold water. Tlien drain them and 
press them dry between the palms of the hands. Chop them fine 
on a chopping board. Then put four ounces of butter in a sauce- 
pan, and when it is melted add the chopped Endives, stirring them 
well over a brisk fire for a few minutes. Season them with salt, 
pepper and nutmeg, and add four spoonfuls of Cream sauce. When 
it is all well mixed and thoroughly warmed, serve it with small 
pieces of toasted broad around the dish.

French FARINA. German 

Farina. . Farina. 

No. 709. Farina is made from wheat or corn and is largely sold 
under the name of Semoule, which, however, is a different article. 
Farina was the first and principal food of the ancient Bornans. It 
is used in soups, puddings and other pastry preparations. When 
it is cooked in milk and sweetened it makes an agreeable diet for 
invalids. It also makes a nice gruel when made with milk, water or 
broth. 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE. 161 

FARINA (POLENTA) OF CORN MEAL, PIEMONTAISE. 

No. 710. Put three quarts of water in a saucepan, and when it 
boils add a little salt and a piece of butter. Then drop in slowly 
two pounds of corn rneal Farina, while stirring it. When it 
commences to thicken set it on the side of the fire to cook slowly 
for twenty-five minutes, stirring it up from the bottom occasionally. 
When it is cooked take it off of the fire and add six ounces of 
butter and six ounces of grated Parmesan cheese, mixing it all well 
together. Then put it in Charlotte moulds, that are buttered with 
clarified butter, and keep them warm until ready for use, when you 
will turn them out and sprinkle grated Parmesan cheese over them. 
Serve them with a reduced beef gravy, in which put some essence 
of mushrooms. 

NOTE. Broth may be used instead of water. If cooked this way serve a tureeu of game consomme 
with them. 

FARINA (POLENTA) OF CORN MEAL ON SKIVERS. 

No. 711. Cook the Farina the same as in No. 710, but keep it 
firmer. When cooked take it off of the fire and add a piece of butter 
and some grated Parmesan cheese. Then pour it in a buttered 
pan, having it about one-quarter of an inch thick, put a buttered 
paper cover over it, and set it on ice to get cold. Cut out as many 
pieces as possible, the size of a twenty-five cent piece, with a round 
cutter. Then cut some Swiss cheese in thin slices, and with the 
same cutter cut out the same number of pieces as you have of the 
Farina. Take a four inch wooden skiver and place on it a ring of 
the Farina, and then a ring of cheese, alternating in this way until 
three inches are covered. Then roll them in fresh bread crumbs, 
dip them in beaten eggs and then bread them again. Mould them 
neatly and fry them in hot lard. When nicely browned drain them 
and replace the wooden skiver with a silver one. Serve them on a 
napkin. 

FARINA CRUSTS (POLENTA) OF CORN MEAL, ITALIAN STYLE. 

No. 712. Cook the Farina as in No. 710, but keep it firmer. 

When it is cooked, add four ounces of butter and six ounces of 

grated Parmesan cheese, and mix them well together. Then put it 

in one dozen small, round buttered Charlotte moulds. Smooth the 

tops evenly, cover them with a buttered paper and set them in a 

cool place. When they are cold turn them out. Remove the paper 

cover, roll them in fresh bread crumbs, and dip them in beaten eggs. 

Then bread them again and shape them nicely. Make a light 

impression on the top of each with a small cutter. Then fry them

162 HARDER' s AMERICAN COOKERY. 

in hot lard, and when nicely browned, drain them. After this, 
take off the small cover and scoop out the center, (taking care not 
to break the shell), and fill them with the following preparation: 

Put the yolks of five raw eggs in a saucepan, add a pinch of nut- 
meg, and dilute it all with half a pint of cream. Add to it one pound 
of grated Parmesan cheese. Set it on a moderate fire and stir it 
until the cheese is melted. (Do not let it boil.) It should have the 
consistency of a sauce. 

When filled, serve them hot. 

PARINA CRUSTS OR STANDS, OF CORN MEAL, FOR HOT OR COLD SIDE DISHES. 

No. 713. These crusts or stands are made either with bread, 
rice or Farina. Those made with Farina are better than those with 
rice, for hot dishes, as they are not so heavy, and are better than 
those made with bread, as the Farina does not absorb the moisture 
as quick as the bread when they lay for any length of time. Cook 
the Farina in water, lightly salted, keeping it firm. When it is 
cooked put it in a buttered mould as near the size of the crust as 
possible, that you intend making. Smooth the surface, cover it 
with a buttered paper, cover and put on this a wooden cover with a 
weight on top to press the Farina down solid in the mould. Lay it 
aside to get cold and hard. Then take it out of the mould, and with 
a small sharp knife cut it into any shape desired. Dip it in beaten 
eggs and then in fresh bread crumbs or raspings of bread, and fry it 
in hot lard until nicely browned. Then drain it and keep it for use. 

FARINA TARTLETS OF CORN MEAL. 

No. 714. Cook the Farina as in No. 710, and keep it firm. But- 
ter some small Tartlet moulds with clarified butter and set them in a 
cool place to let the butter get cold. Put the Farina into the 
moulds with a table knife, leaving a space in the center for filling. 
Fill the center with grated Parmesan cheese and smooth off the 
top. Then set them in a cool place, and when they are cold take 
them out of the moulds. Bread them in a mixture of half bread 
crumbs and half grated Parmesan cheese. Then dip them in beaten 
eggs and bread them again with the same mixture. Shape them 
well, then fry them in hot lard until nicely browned. Then drain 
them, dish them up on a napkin and serve them hot. 

FARINA QUENELLES, OR BALLS, OF CORN MEAL. 

No. 715. These are made nearly the same as Tartlets, except 
that Gruyere cheese is used instead of Parmesan cheese. When 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE. 163 

they are cold dip them in beaten eggs and fry them in hot lard. 
They may be used as a garniture or served the same as Tartlets. 

FRIED FARINA (POLENTA) OF CORN MEAL, RAMEQUIN. 

No. 716. Cook one pound of Farina as in No. 710. When it is 
cooked take it off of the fire, add three ounces of butter divided 
into small pieces, and four ounces cf grated Parmesan cheese. 
Season it with salt, pepper, nutmeg and a pinch of sugar, and mix it 
well together. Moisten the pan slightly with cold water and drop a 
soup-spoonful of the Polenta into it so it will spread out a little, and 
continue doing this until the bottom of the pan is well covered, 
keeping each cake separate. Put some grated Parmesan cheese in 
the center of each, or a small piece of Gruyere cheese. Now cover 
each piece with a thin layer of the Polenta and set the pan aside, so 
the cakes will get cold. With a cutter about the size of a dollar 
cut out the cakes to a round shape. Take them out of the pan, dip 
them in beaten eggs and then in bread crumbs. Put a little clarified 
butter in a frying pan, and when it is warm add the Ramequin (not 
putting too many in the pan at a time), and fry them on both sides 
to a nice brown. Serve them on a napkin with fried parsley as a 
garniture. 

FARINA (POLENTA) FOR GARNITURES. 

No. 717. When the Polenta is cooked as in No. 710, put it in 
small round buttered Charlotte moulds and keep them warm. Then 
turn them out and use them for large garnitures. They are espe- 
cially appropriate for Italian dinners. Those prepared as in Nos. 
713, 714, 715 and 716 can also be used as garnitures. 

FARINA GRUEL. 

No. 718. Boil one pint of water, milk or broth, and when boil- 
ing drop in it four soup-spoonfuls of Farina, stirring it well. Let 
it cook slowly for twenty-five minutes. Sweeten or season to taste.

No. 719. Fecula is the nutritious part of wheat, starch, farina 
or potatoes. It is used in sauces and soups, being devoid of flavor, 



164 HARDER'S AMERICAN COOKERY. 

and is nutritious, healthful and light. It can be used for every 
purpose that arrow root is used for. In cooking Fecula for inva- 
lids, it should be first diluted in cold water and then put in boiling 
milk, broth or water. About two spoonfuls is sufficient for a pint 
of liquid. Stir it well when putting it in. Let it cook for about 
twenty minutes, and then season or sweeten it as may be desired.

French SWEET FENNEL. German 

Fenouil. fenchel. 

No. 720. Sweet Fennel is a hardy, perennial, aromatic plant, of 
which there are several varieties. The common, or bitter fennel, 
has strong, deep, fleshy roots, and the seeds have a brownish color 
and a bitter taste similar to the leaves. Sweet Fennel seeds are 
used by confectioners and distillers, and the leaves are used for 
flavoring soups and sauces. The seeds resemble anise seeds. 

CULTURE. 

No. 721. Fennel is cultivated the same as anise. Italian Fennel 
is quite distinct from the common variety, and is cultivated 
annually. The flowers are produced in umbels, as in the other 
species. The seeds are yellowish in color, slender, slightly curved, 
and have a pleasant anise like taste. When the stems have attained 
a sufficient size, they should be earthed up, the same as celery, to 
blanch. If properly treated the stems will be white, crisp and 
tender in about three weeks. When blanched they lose their bitter 
taste and are excellent for salads, possessing a sweet, pleasant, 
aromatic taste, and may be served the same way as plain celery for 
a relish. 

STEWED FENNEL. 

No. 722. Wash the Fennel in plenty of cold water and trim off 
the hard leaves. Parboil them for five minutes, then immerse them 
in cold water, and trim them evenly. Then cook them the same as 
celery, in No. 462. Pour over them some Butter, Allemande or 
Espagnole sauce.

French FLAVORS, ESSENCES, AND EXTRACTS. German 

Essence. Extrakt. 

No. 723. Flavors, essences and extracts, are used by confec- 
tioners and pastry cooks, and for various culinary purposes, to 
impart an agreeable aroma, and are purchased in liquid form. The 
best quality should always be procured. Aromatic herbs and plants 
are used in making coffee, tea, wine, juleps, and many other drinks. 
The concentrated essence of meat, game, fish, or vegetables, when 
added to sauces and other culinary preparations gives a splendid 
flavor and is greatly relished. 

ESSENCE OF VEGETABLES. 

No. 724. Put in a saucepan four pounds of rump of beef, a 
shin of veal cut in pieces, one hen, ten carrots, eight onions, five 
turnips, two heads of lettuce, two heads of celery, a faggot of 
chervil, and half a dozen cloves. Pour one gallon of broth 
over this and let it boil. Skim it well and let it cook slowly until 
well done. Then strain the broth, and if not strong enough 
reduce it to one quart.

FLOUR. 

Farine. Mehl. 

No. 725. Flour is the finely ground meal of wheat or any other 
grain, and has many grades and varieties. It is much used for 
alimentary purposes, and the best should always be procured. The 
flour used in making bread is of a different quality than that of 
which pastry is made. Flour when dried in the oven and lightly 
colored or cooked with butter to a light brown, gives a better flavor 
to sauces. It also makes a healthful soup and is more digestible 
than when used raw. 

REPERE. 

No. 726. Eepere is flour mixed with the white of eggs into a 
paste, and is used to make crusts stands, or any borders adhere 
to a dish.

ARTICLK XCIV. 



GARLIC. 

Ail. Knoblauch. 

No. 728. Garlic is a bulbous rooted plant, having a strong, pen- 
etrating odor. The bulb is composed of many smaller bulbs called 
cloves. It is not popular with Americans, although used consid- 
erably in Europe and in the Southern States. It should be 
used with moderation, as the breath of persons who eat Garlic is 
very offensive. It is used in many preparations, but can be omitted 
and replaced by using shallots or onions, when desired. Garlic, 
when used in salad, should be rubbed on a crust of bread (called 
chapon). When used for stews, etc., and left whole, its flavor will 
not be strong and penetrating as when mashed or chopped, and 
gives the preparation an appetizing and agreeable taste, especially 
in mutton stews. 

CULTURE. 

No. 729. Prepare the ground the same as for onions. Plant the 
bulbs in drills eight inches apart, and four inches apart in rows, 
and cover them two inches deep. When the leaves turn yellow, 
take up the bulbs and dry them as you would do with onions. 

GARLIC BUTTER OR GASCONY BUTTER. 

No. 730. Boil one dozen cloves of Garlic for ten minutes. Then 
drain them and pound them in a mortar with half a pound of but- 
ter. Add a little nutmeg and a pinch of red pepper, and when well 
mixed, rub it through a fine sieve and keep it in a cool place.

CHAPON FOR SALAD DRESSING. , 

No. 731. This is principally used when dressing endives or 
dandelion for salad, but may be used in all green salads to give it a 
Garlic flavor. Cut a crust of bread the size of half a dollar, rub it 
with the clove of Garlic and mix it in with the salad. 

PUREE OF GARLIC. 

No. 732. Peel one dozen Garlic bulbs and parboil them in plenty 
of water lightly salted, until they are cooked. Then drain them 
and put them in a saucepan with a piece of butter. Set it on a 
brisk fire to reduce the moisture. Season with salt and a pinch of 
red pepper and rub them through a fine sieve. Put the puree in a

tively small size, with a regular oval formation. It grows on a 
pretty vine, having leaves similar to the watermelon, and is princi- 
pally grown for pickling. It is seldom used at the table in its raw 
state. In America small cucumbers are used, and when pickled are 
called Gherkins. See Cucumbers, Article LXXVI.

GINGER. 

Gingembre. Ingwer. 

No. 734. Ginger is an aromatic plant, a native of Hindostan, 
and is cultivated in all parts of India and China. The root is the 
portion in which the virtues of the plant reside. After the roots 



168 HAEDEE'S AMERICAN COOKEEY, 

are gathered and cleansed they are scalded in boiling water, to 
prevent germination, and are then rapidly dried. This is the ordinary 
black ginger, most of which comes from Calcutta, and is called East 
India Ginger. In Jamaica another variety is prepared by selecting 
the best roots, depriving them of their epidermis and drying them 
carefully in the sun. This is the highly valued white Ginger, 
generally called Jamaica Ginger. A preserve is made from Ginger 
by selecting the young roots, depriving them of their cortical 
covering and boiling them in syrup. This is imported from the 
East and West Indies, and from China. When good it is translucent 
and tender. The odor of Ginger is aromatic and penetrating, the 
taste spicy, pungent, hot, and biting. These properties gradually 
diminish and are ultimately lost by exposure. It is used by pastry 
cooks, and confectioners, in putting up spiced preserves and fruits. 
Pieces of Ginger that are light and friable, worm-eaten or very 
fibrous, should be rejected. Ginger is often adulterated with rice- 
starch, flour-ginger, brick dust, chalk, capsicum, and mustard. 
Ginger is a grateful stimulant and carminative, and is often given 
in dyspepsia, flatulent colic, and the feeble state of the alimentary 
canal attendant upon atonic gout.

flowers are produced on separate plants, the former being very 
numerous, and panipulated. The fertile flowers are generally 
cemented together, or form a collection of small scales which are 
more or less covered with a fine yellow powder called Lupalin. 
The plant is principally cultivated for its flowers, which are largely 
used by manufacturers of malt liquors. The young shoots are cut 
in the spring, and used for culinary purposes, when they are five

best, attaining a large brown colored root, the flesh of which is 
white. It has a burning spicy taste, and is used both raw and 
cooked. It is grated and served as a relish, or in sauces, and is 
also very agreeable to eat with boiled beef. 

CULTURE. 

No. 756. The best method of growing Horse-radish is from the 
little roots, four or five inches in length, and not from the crowns. 
The small roots will produce good radish fit for use in one season's 
growth. Plant a set with the small end down, where the slanting cut 
is, and so that the top will be two inches under the soil. It can remain 
in the ground until very late in the autumn, and can be bedded, or a 
portion can remain in the ground until spring. A dozen roots will 
furnish all that will be needed for family use for a life time, as it 
constantly increases, and the only danger is that it will spread too 
fast and become troublesome. It is best, therefore, to plant it in 
some corner of the garden where it can grow without injuring other 
plants. 



174 HAEDEE'S AMEEICAN COOKEEY. 

HOESE-EADISH FOE A EELISH. 

No. 757. Scrape and grate the roots, put them into an earthen

No. 765. The tree from which this seed is procured grows in 
the Phillipme Islands and in China. The natives call it Pansi- 
Pansi. The seeds give an agreeable taste to alimentary compounds 
and are much used in the West India chocolates. The oil has the 
same properties as that of anise seed, but is more subtile and pene- 
trating. The Chinese eat the seeds as a relish after their repasts, 
and the natives of India make a liquor from them called Anise- 
Arak, which is largely exported to Holland, where it is also highly 
esteemed.

are the only part of the plant eaten, and when young are tender and 
delicate. The ripe seeds are soaked in water, the same as our com- 
mon dry white beans are. They then become quite soft and tender, 
and have a pleasant nutty and oily flavor. There is a variety with 
green seeds, which is considered superior to the yellow seeded. 
They thrive best in the Southern States in this country. Prepare 
and cook them the same as our common peas. 

CULTURE. 

No. 767. The plant is raised from seed and requires the entire

French LETTUCE. German 

Lailue. Lattichsalat. 

No. 800. Lettuce is a hardy annual plant of Asiatic origin, and 
is always grown from seed. It may be had at all seasons of the 
year, but its quality is not always the same. There is no vegetable 
more generally used than Lettuce, yet few people know how appe- 
tizing it is when brought to the table fresh and in an unwilted con- 
dition. It ranks as one of the best green salads, and is much used 
with chicken and other salads. Lettuce is also used as a vegetable 
prepared the same as spinach, and when stuffed, and is used as a 
garniture for soups and meats. There are a number of varieties of 
Lettuce. 

CULTURE. 

No. 801. The quality of Lettuce depends largely upon rapid and 
vigorous growth, and to secure that we need very rich, mellow soil, 
frequent surface cultivation, and an abundant supply of water. 
For the earliest crop sow the seed under glass, in March, and thin 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE. 183 

out the plants to prevent crowding. If you intend to mature the 
plants under glass, keep the beds quite close, and water it frequently 
and abundantly with liquid manure, and keep it well shaded during 
sunny days. If the plants are to be set in the open ground, give 
them all the air possible, without freezing them, and harden them 
off by full exposure and the withdrawal of water before transplanting. 
The plants should be set out as soon as a warm spot can be made 
very rich and mellow. When they are set out, sow the seeds in 
drills, fourteen inches apart, and thin them out, as wanted for the 
table, until they stand eighteen inches apart. Hoe them frequently, 
and water them when dry. The Cos varieties should be tied up 
about ten days before using, in order to blanch the inner leaves. 

EARLY TENNIS BALL. 

No. 802. This is the best variety of head Lettuce for growing 
under glass, being very hardy and having thick, crisp, and tender 
leaves. It forms a compact head under glass, but when in the open 
air, unless planted very early, it is liable to be loose and open. 

BLACK SEEDED SIMPSON. 

No. 803. The leaves of this variety are very large and form a 
compact mass, rather than a distinct head. They are of superior 
quality, being thin and tender, and of a light green color. Their 
color prevents any wilting of the plant being noticed, and as a 
consequence, it is a popular market variety. 

SIMPSON EARLY CURLED. 

No. 804. This is one of the best early varieties for family use. 
All of the leaves tend to produce a large loose head. The leaves 
are dark green, beautifully crimped, and are tender and crisp. 

EARLY BOSTON CURLED. 

No. 805. This variety has numerous large dark green leaves, 
that grow close together, the edges being deeply frilled, so that the 
whole plant forms around mass, closely resembling a bunch of moss. 

EARLY PRIZE HEAD (FERRY'S). 

No. 806. This is the best Lettuce known. It forms a mammoth 
hardy plant, of which even the outer leaves are crisp and tender, 



184 HARDER'S AMERICAN COOKERY. 

remaining so throughout the season. It is slow to run up to seed. 
Its flavor is delicious, and it is much used in soups, etc. 

HANSON. 

No. 807. This is a very fine heading variety, of large size, and 
stands the sun better than any other sort. The heads are large, 
solid, sweet, tender, and crisp throughout, and are devoid of any 
bitter taste. 

DEACON. 

No. 808. This plant is small, having very thick and smooth dark 
green leaves, which are crisp and tender. 

EARLY CURLED SILESIA. 

No. 809. An early variety of very strong growth, which does not 
form a head, but is the best kind for cutting and bunching when 
young. The leaves are large and wrinkled and of a light yellow 
color. It resembles the Cos varieties in quality. 

FRANKFORT HEAD. 

No. 810. A dark green curled variety with close round heads, 
which when opened are finely blanched and very crisp. It remains 
in head a long time. 

LARGE DRUMHEAD. 

No. 811. The head is remarkably large and compact, though 
somewhat flattened. It is crisp and tender and one of the finest 
summer varieties. Its color is pale green without and white in the 
center. 

PHILADELPHIA BUTTER. 

No. 812. This is a very early variety, desirable for forcing and 
for early planting, out of doors, but it does not stand the sun well. 
It is medium in size, having a compact head, the leaves being 
smooth and thick and of a bluish-green color. 

BROWN DUTCH. 

No. 813. This is an old and hardy variety, and always forms a 
large, solid head, which is somewhat coarse looking. The leaves 
are large and thick, of a deep green color outside, but beautifully 
blanched within. They are exceedingly sweet, tender, and of good 
flavor. 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE. 185 

GREEN FRINGED. 

No. 814. An ornamental variety of exceeding beaut}*, but 
inferior in quality. The inside of the leaves is white, the edges a 
light green, delicately fringed and crimped. Its handsome 
appearance makes it well worthy of cultivation for table decoration 
alone. 

WHITE PARIS COS. 

No. 815. This is a large hardy variety, which takes long in 
running to seed, and is considered by many to be far better than 
the other varieties. The heads are long and upright, with oblong 
leaves, that are tender, brittle, and highly flavored. 

SALAMANDER. 

No. 816. This is the best variety for summer use, forming large, 
compact heads. It is light green in color outside, and white inside. 
Its great advantage is that it will stand drought and heat, and will 
remain longer in heads than the other varieties. 

LETTUCE BRAIZED, SPANISH STYLE. 

No. 817. Select one dozen solid heads of Lettuce and trim off 
the outer leaves. Wash the Lettuce in plenty of cold water and 
then drain them. Parboil them for five minutes, then immerse 
them in cold water. After this press each head in the hand well, 
arrange them on a napkin and trim them. Next line a deep flat 
saucepan with thin slices of fat pork, on which you will put the 
heads of Lettuce side by side. Season with salt, pepper and nut- 
meg, and add a faggot of parsley garnished with two bay leaves, a 
sprig of thyme and two onions having three cloves stuck in each. 
Cover each head of Lettuce with slices of fat pork and moisten 
them with stock broth. Cover the saucepan and let this boil once 
and then set it on the side of the fire to cook slowly until done. 
Then drain them on a sieve and sponge off the grease with a nap- 
kin. Then put them in a saucepan with three spoonfuls of half 
glaze, and set them in the oven. When glazed serve them with a 
reduced Espagnole sauce. 

LETTUCE BRAIZED, GERMAN STYLE. 

No. 818. Prepare the Lettuce as in No. 817, and when cooked 
drain them on a napkin and sponge off the grease. Then dish them 
up and pour over them some Allemande sauce, reduced with cream. 



186 HARDER'S AMERICAN COOKERY. 

STUFFED LETTUCE. 

No. 819. Prepare one dozen heads of Lettuce as in No. 817, and 
when parboiled immerse them in cold water, then press them in 
the hands and dry them. Put them on a towel on the table, spread 
out the leaves of each head and season with salt, pepper, and 
nutmeg. Add in the middle of each head some forced meat of veal 
(Godiveau) flavored with cooked fine herbs. Put the Lettuce in 
shape again, trim them and arrange them in a deep flat saucepan, 
lined with thin slices of fat pork. Moisten them with veal gravy, 
then let them boil, after which cover the saucepan and set it in the 
oven. Sprinkle them with the gravy occasionally, so they will glaze 
nicely. When cooked dish them up, strain off the gravy, take off 
the grease, and serve the gravy with them. 

LETTUCE STUFFED AND FRIED. 

No. 820. Prepare the Lettuce the same as in No. 819, and when 
cooked drain them on a sieve, and sponge off the grease with a 
napkin. Then bread them and dip them in beaten eggs, and then 
bread them again in fresh bread crumbs. Fry them in hot lard and 
serve them on a napkin, with a garniture of fried parsley. 

LETTUCE WITH CREAM. 

No. 821. Trim off the outer leaves of one dozen heads of Lettuce 
and wash the heads in cold water several times. Then put them 
in a saucepan, with boiling water lightly salted, and let them cook 
for ten minutes on a brisk fire. Then immerse them in cold water, 
drain them in a colander and press them dry in the hands. Then 
chop them fine. Put six ounces of butter in a saucepan, and when 
melted add two spoonfuls of flour, and let it cook to a light brown. 
Then add the Lettuce, stirring it in well, and season with salt, 
pepper, and nutmeg. Add in slowly a pint of cream and let it cook 
for ten minutes. Before serving, garnish it with hard boiled eggs, 
cut in quarters, and with toasted bread, cut in fancy shapes. 

LETTUCE, WITH GRAVY. 

No. 822. Proceed the same as in No. 821, but in place of cream 
add some veal gravy or a good broth. Garnish with poached eggs 
or toast. 

LETTUCE FOR GARNITURE. 

No. 823. When Lettuce is to be used for garnishing joints or 
large entries, use the braized or stuffed Lettuce as in Nos. 817, 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE. 187 

818, 819 and 820. When it is used for garnishing small entrees 
and broiled meats, use Lettuce with cream or gravy, as in Nos. 821 
and 822. When it is used as a salad garniture select the inner 
leaves and steep them in cold water until ready for use. Keep the 
hearts to place on the top of the salad, or cut them in fine shreds 
and garnish around the dish, alternating with eggs. 

LETTUCE SALADS. 

No. 824. Trim oft* the outer leaves of the Lettuce, wash the 
heads in cold water, trim the leaves, and then drain them on a 
salad strainer. Before using, drain them on a napkin, being 
careful not to press the leaves. Put them in a salad bowl and 
season with salt, pepper, sweet oil and vinegar. 

NOTE. Dress the salad only when ready for use. Germans generally add some sliced young 
onions and a mustard dressing. This is made by mashing the yolk of a hard boiled egg in a salad 
bowl, diluting it with oil and vinegar, and adding mustard. Then mix it well together and season 
with salt and pepper. Pour this mixture over the Lettuce, and mix it well with a wooden spoon and 
fork in a careful manner. Americans, especially in New England, dress the salad with sugar, vinegar, 
and cream. In the South they use oil, vinegar, salt, and pepper, or with a Mayonnaise dressing, and 
garnished with hard boiled eggs. The French add some fine chopped chervil and tarragon, and 
occasionally a clove of garlic, chopped fine, or some garlic rubbed on a crust of bread (Chapon). 
The Spaniards and Mexicans add some fine sliced green peppers, with sliced green onions. The 
English use a dressing made with the yolks of hard boiled eggs, diluted with oil, vinegar, and the 
juice of onions or shallots, and seasoned with salt and pepper. For a family dinner dish up the 
salad plain, with hard boiled eggs separately, or as a garniture. It requires an expert to dress a salad 
well. When ready for the salad the hostess should dress it, or if one of the company Is noted as a 
good salad dresser, she should request him to dress it. 

LETTUCE WITH CONSOMME (CAEBUKE). 

GRATINATED CRUSTS WITH LETTUCE. 

No. 825. Trim one dozen heads of Lettuce, wash them well in 
cold water and then parboil them for ten minutes. Then immerse 
them in cold Avater and press them dry in the hands. Arrange the 
leaves nicely and tie them so they will keep their shape. Now 
prepare a deep, Hat saucepan lined with thin slices of fat pork, 
some trimmings of veal, four sliced carrots and one sliced onion. 
Then put the Lettuce in and add a faggot of parsley garnished with 
one bay leaf and three cloves. Cover it all with thin slices of fat 
pork and moisten with enough broth to cover it. Set it on the fire 
to boil. Then cover the saucepan and set it on one side to cook 
slowly until tender. Then take them out carefully, place them on 
a clean board, take off the strings and cut them in two or three

serve with a soup tureen of consomme. 



LETTUCE WATER FOR INVALIDS. 

No. 826. Wash and clean three heads of Lettuce, and soak 
them in one quart of boiling water for one hour. Then strain it 
through a napkin. Season with a little sugar, and take a cupful 
one hour before each meal for several days. It is recommended for 
those whose stomachs are deranged and also for those afflicted with 
nervousness. 

PRESERVED LETTUCE WHOLE. 

No 827. Select three dozen fresh picked heads of Lettuce and 
trim off the outer leaves. Wash them well in cold water, and then 
parboil them for ten minutes in water lightly salted. Then immerse 
them in cold water and dry them on a napkin. Then arrange them 
in a flat saucepan and moisten them with enough broth to cover 
them. Let them cook until tender, and then drain them on a napkin. 
Cut out the stalks, and then cut the heads of Lettuce in half, 
lengthwise, laying the tops over in the middle close together, so 
they will not curl outward. Then put them in square quart tin 
cans, the same way that you would arrange asparagus. Cover them 
with water lightly salted, solder on the covers and boil the tin cans 
in a hot water bath for two hours.

French LICORICE. Herman. 

Reylisse . Silshols-B/'/renzuker. 

No. 830. Licorice is a hardy perennial plant, the root of which 
abounds with a sweet juice, and is much used in demulcent compo- 
sitions. It has fleshy, creeping roots, which, when undisturbed, 
attain great length and penetrate deep into the earth. The roots- 
are the only part of the plant used, and are used by porter brewers- 
and confectioners and for medicinal purposes. The sweet, mucilagi- 
nous juice, which is extracted from the roots by boiling, is much 
esteemed as an emollient for coughs and colds. 

CULTURE. 



No. 831. It is propagated by planting slips of the roots, four or 
six inches long, that have two or three buds. Plant them in March/ 
as soon as the ground can be worked, eighteen inches apart in rows 
that are three feet apart, covering them with three inches of earth. 
Every year late in autumn, when the sap has gone down and the 
leaves turned yellow, cut the old stem down with a pruning knife 
to a level with the ground. At this time the creeping stems are 
forked up and cut off close to the main stems. They are then 
preserved in sand for future planting. The roots will be ready for 
taking up three years after planting. This should be done towards 
winter, when the sap goes down in the roots. A trench three feet 
deep should then be dug around the roots, so they can be extracted 
without injury to them. They are then kept in sand until used.

LIMA BEANS. 

Feve Boh>>e. 

No. 832. The Lima Bean is one of the latest and most tender 
of garden beans. The stem is about ten feet high, and the leaves 
are smooth, shiny and narrow, yet comparatively long. The pods 
are about four inches long and an inch and a quarter broad, being 
flattened in shape, and containing from three to five beans. They 
are green and wrinkled when young, and of a yellowish color when 



190 HAEDEE'S AMEEICAN COOKEEY. 

ripe. The pods are tough and parchment-like in all stages of their 
growth, and are never eaten. The Beans when either green or ripe, 
are universally esteemed for their peculiar flavor and excellence. 
If gathered when suitable for use in their green state, and dried in 
the pods, they can be preserved during the winter. When required 
for use, they should be shelled, then soaked for a short time in 
clear water, and cooked the same as green beans. When they are 
treated in this manner, they will be found to be nearly as tender and 
well flavored as when freshly plucked from the plants. The Lima 
Bean seldom perfects its crop in the Northern States, as only a 
small portion of the pods attain a good size, being destroyed by 
early frost. 

CULTUBE. 

No. 833. Commence planting when the weather is settled and 
the soil is warm and in good working condition. Procure a num- 
ber of poles six feet in length and set them out three feet apart 
each way. Plant five or six Beans in each hill, covering them with 
one inch of soil and being careful to set each Bean with its germ 
downward. After they have grown for awhile and before they 
begin to run, pull up the weakest and leave but three of the most 
vigorous plants in each hill. As they increase in height they should 
be tied to the poles with a soft, fibrous material. When they have 
ascended to the tops of the poles the ends should be pinched off'. 
The ends of all branches that rise above that height should also be 
treated in the same way. This prevents them from running into 
vines and tends to make them blossom earlier and bear sooner and 
more abundantly. When cultivated near the Sieva, the varieties 
readily hybridize and the Lima Bean rapidly degenerates. Plants 
grown in the Southern States are healthy and vigorous and produce 
large Beans of excellent quality. 

GEEEN LIMA BEANS. 

No. 834. This is a sub-variety of the common Lima Bean, 
differing from it principally, in the pea-green color of the seed. It 
will remain longer on the plant without becoming hard, and is 
considered more tender than other kinds. 

MOTTLED LIMA BEANS. 

No. 835. This is also a sub-variety of the common Lima Bean. 
The seeds are of a dull white, or greenish-white color, mottled or 
clouded with purple.

lemon, but smaller and more intensely sour. It is a handsome tree 
and is found in all warm climates. It has panicles of light yellow 
flowers and large cordate leaves. The flowering buds should be picked 
before the rising of the sun. They should then be peeled and dried 
and kept in a clean, cool place, free from dust. They are used for 
tisanes.

LOVAGE. 

Angelique afeuille-d'ache. Lieb Ktockel. 

No. 837. Lovage is a hardy perennial plant having a hollow, 
branching stem six or seven feet high. It has smooth, deep green, 
glossy leaves, that somewhat resemble those of celery. The roots 
are large and fleshy, having a dark-brown color without and being 
yellowish within. Both the roots and seeds are used. The roots 
are sliced and dried and are used by confectioners in that state. 
They are also used in medicine as an aromatic stimulant. 

CULTURE. 

No. 838. Lovage requires a deep, rich, moist soil, and should 
be sown in August, or immediately after ripening. When the 
young plants have grown three inches, transplant them three feet 
apart in each direction. When they are well established they will 
require but little care and will continue for years.

.yellow Lupine are grown for their farinaceous seeds. The pods 
are straight and hairy, about three inches long, and contain five or 
six large, white, flattened seeds, having a slightly bitter taste. 
They are said to possess important medicinal qualities. The yellow 
Lupine, which is a native of Sicily, is a hardy annual plant, resem- 
bling the white species. They are both grown in some parts of this

pods, which are sometimes twelve inches in length. They are 
solid, crisp, and tender, and when young they are used for pickling, 
and for salads, being much superior to the common radish. The 
roots are sometimes eaten whole when they are young and tender, 
but they soon become fibrous, strongly flavored and unfit for use. 
When the Madras Radish is cultivated for its pods, sow it in drills 
that are two feet apart, and thin the plants to nine inches apart in 
the drills.

No. 842. Mallow is an annual plant that was introduced from 
Europe, and which grows spontaneously in gardens when once cul- 
tivated. The stems are frequently more than six feet in height. 
The leaves, which are of a rich green color, are nearly five inches 
in diameter and are smooth, lobed and beautifully frilled or curled 
on the borders. No part of the plant is considered suitable for 
food, but the beautiful leaves are used for garnishing desserts. 
Sow the seeds about the first of May, covering them with one inch 
of soil. The plant requires much space. 



ARTICLK CXXIV. 



MARANTA, OR ARROW-ROOT PLANT. 

Arrow-root. Arrow-mehl. 

No. 843. This is a genus of plants found in tropical America, 
and some species also in India. They have tuberous roots contain- 
ing a large amount of starch, and from one species arrow-root is 
obtained. The Indians are said to employ the roots of this species 
in extracting the poison of arrows, whence the name. The fecula 
obtained is called Arrow-Boot. The root of this plant is perennial, 
tuberous, fleshy, horizontal and scaly, and is a foot or more in 
length, having numerous long, white fibres. It sends forth several 
tuberous jointed, curved, white stoles, the points of which some- 
times rise above the ground and become new plants* Several 
stems proceed annually from the same root, being branched and 
slender, and about four inches high. The Arrow-Root plant is a 
native of the West Indies, where it is largely cultivated; and its 
cultivation is also carried on in the East Indies, Africa and the 
Southern States. That from the Bermuda Islands is most esteemed, 
Jamaica furnishing the next best quality. The plant is propagated 
early, by cutting off the roots. Arrow-Boot is adulterated with 
flour from other roots, such as the Curcuma and the Tacca Oceanica 
from the Sandwich Islands. Potato flour is also used. Arrow- 
Boot when ground, is a light, white powder, devoid of taste or

odor. It lias a firm feeling when pressed between the fingers, and 
produces a faint crackling sound when rubbed. It is a pure starch, 
corresponding in its chemical properties with that of corn starch 
or potato starch. When purchased it should be free from any 
unpleasant flavor, as it is liable to get musty. Keep it in a dry 
place. 

PREPARTfON OF ITS FLOUR. 

No. 844. The flour is prepared in the following manner: The 
roots are dug up when a year old, then washed and pounded into a 
pulp, which is thrown into water to separate the amylacteous from 
the fibrous portion. The fibres are removed with the hands, which 
leaves the starch suspended in the water, to which it gives a milky 
color. The milky fluid is strained through a coarse towel, aixUs 
allowed to stand that the flour may settle. The flour is then washed 
with fresh water and is dried afterwards in the sun. 

ITS USE. 

No. 845. Arrow-Root is nutritious and demulcent, and affords a 
light and easily digested article of diet for the sick and convalescent. 
It is peculiarly suited, from its demulcent properties, to those 
afflicted with complaints of the bowels and diseases of the urinary 
passages. It is much used as food, for infants after weaning or 
when the mother's milk is insufficient. It is prepared by dissolv- 
ing it in hot water with which it forms a pearly gelatinous solution, 
and if sufficiently thick it forms a jelly-like mass when cool. A 
tablespoonful will contribute sufficient consistence to a pint of water. 
It should first be made into a paste with a little cold water and the 
boiling water should then be added, with brisk agitation. The 
preparation may be rendered more palatable by adding lemon juice 
and sugar, or, in extreme sickness, by adding wine and spices. It 
is usually prepared with milk when taken by children.

No. 854. Mint is a hardy perennial aromatic plant, producing, 
by distillation, a highly odoriferous and pungent essential oil. It- 
is generally cultivated in gardens, but grows naturally near brooks 
and in rich, moist soil. It is used in making sauces for flavoring, 
for medicinal purposes, for flavoring drinks, and by confectioners. 
The common or plain leaved variety is the best for general use. 
The Spear -Mint is inferior for culinary purposes, but is prettier 
for garnishing, on account of the curled foliage.

No. 858. In its natural state the Morel is found growing in 
orchards, in damp woods, and in moist pastures. There are 
several varieties, all of which are edible. It is about four inches 
in height and is distinguished by its white cylindrical hol- 
low, and solid smooth stem. Its cap is spherical and hollow, 
and of a dark brown or gravy color. It adheres to the stem by its 
base, and is deeply pitted over the entire surface. It is in perfec- 
tion early in the season, but should not be gathered after a rain or 
while it is wet with dew. If gathered when dry it may be preserved 
many months. The Morel is much used in its dry or fresh state, to 
heighten the flavor of stews and gravies. This mushroom is to be 
obtained from Italian warehouses and is the best variety in use in 
its dried state.

Froucl. MULLEN, OR MULLEIN. German 

Molene ou Bouillon blane Wollkrout. 

No. 866. Mullen is a field plant. Its leaves and flowers have 
been employed as remedial agents. They have a slight odor and 
a mucilaginous, bitterish, feeble taste. Mullen leaves are demul- 
cent and emollient, and are said to possess anodyne properties, 
which render them useful in pectoral complaints. A strained infu- 
sion of the flowers is used in mild catarrhs and in diarrhoea. It 
will be found advantageous to moisten the leaves previous to boil- 
ing them. Pick the flowers before they expand, dry them in the 
shade, mixing and turning them occasionally to have them perfectly 
dry. Keep them in boxes in a cool dry place, and use them in diet

MUSHROOMS. 

Champignon ou Moufseron. Champignon, or Ertshicamm. 

No. 867. The Mushroom is one of a large class of cryptogamic 
plants of the natural order of fungi. The name is sometimes pop- 
ularly restricted to such species as are used for food. It is a cellu- 



200 HARDER' s AMERICAN COOKERY. 

lar plant, having generally a more or less rounded thallus supported 
upon a stalk, and having seeds upon the under surface or gills. 
They are numerous, being found in all parts of the world, and are 
usually of very rapid growth, often springing up and coming to 
maturity in a single day. Many species are used for food in differ- 
ent parts of the world, while other species are poisonous. Many 
varieties abound in the pastures and woods in all the States, and 
may be gathered wild and enjoyed by those who have not the 
means of raising them artificially. They are gathered in all the 
different stages of their growth, and are used boiled, stewed, 
stuffed or broiled, and when dried are used for flavoring. The 
current belief is that, while many fungi are virulently poisonous, 
others, including the common Mushroom, are free from poison, 
and may be eaten in any quantity. The fear of poison deters many 
from making any use of this savory and nourishing but treacherous 
vegetable, and if they are afraid to eat them it is a matter of con- 
siderable importance to have the real standing of fungi as food 
stuffs made clear. According to recent investigations the question 
seems to be, not how to distinguish the poisonous from harmless 
species, but how to treat Mushrooms of every sort in such a way as 
to remove or neutralize the poison which they contain, with the pre- 
caution of using this class of food stuffs at all times with modera- 
tion. It has been ascertained that repeated washing with cold 
water removes most of the poison of Mushrooms, and that boiling 
dissolves out the rest. The water in which Mushrooms are boiled, 
however, is always poisonous, more so even than raw Mushrooms. 
Dried Mushrooms have been found to be dangerous for twenty 
days, and also the water in which such Mushrooms had been boiled. 
They are not really safe until after four months' drying. There- 
fore, treat all Mushrooms as poisonous; carefully throw out all the 
water in which they have been washed; cook them well, and never 
eat them in large quantities. The fact that all Mushrooms are more 
or less poisonous should be no bar to their use as food, proper care 
being taken in the cooking and eating. The detection of poisonous 
Mushrooms is a matter of deep consideration. The surest method 
of detecting them, and a precaution that should always be taken, is 
to put a silver coin or a solid silver spoon in the water in which 
Mushrooms are cooked. If the silver assumes a bluish or black 
color it may be assured that one or perhaps all of the Mushrooms 
are poisonous, and they should be thrown away. 

CULTURE. 

No. 868. There can be no doubt but what all of the edible kinds 
would finally submit to and probably improve by cultivation, though

as } 7 et but a single species has been generally introduced into the 
garden. The common Mushroom is the only kind cultivated, and 
can be grown in cellars, sheds, on shelves in the open air, or in 
caves free from iron or coal. Beds of the required width and length 
are made of fermenting horse manure, at a temperature of about 
seventy degrees, being eighteen inches deep. Plant the broken 
pieces of spawn in this bed, six inches apart, covering the whole 
with two inches of light soil, and protecting it from cold or severe 
rains. The Mushrooms will appear in about six weeks. Irrigate 
only when the bed is quite dry, with soft or lukewarm water. The 
best of all situations, when available, in which to grow Mushrooms, 
are underground caves, such as supply the Paris markets with such 
vast quantities. 

THE COMMON MUSHROOM. 

No. 869. When the common Mushroom first appears it has a 
white color, is of a roundish button-like form, and apparently rests 
on the surface of the ground. When fully developed the stem is 
solid and two inches in height, and its cap measures from one to 
four inches in diameter, changing to a brownish color when old and 
becoming tough and fleshy. It is readily distinguished when of 
medium size, by its fine pink or flesh-colored gills and pleasant 
odor. When old, the gills become of a chocolate color and it is 
then liable to be confounded with other kinds of a dubious quality. 
However, the species which resemble it most is slimy to the touch 
and is devoid of its fine odor,, having rather a disagreeable smell. 
The noxious kinds always grow in woods or on the margin of woods, 
while the wholesome Mushroom springs up chiefly in open pastures, 
and should be gathered only in such places when young and tender. 
The Mushroom produces no real seed, but instead of it has a white 
fibrous substance in broken threads, called spawn, which is pre- 
served in horse manure, being pressed in the shape of bricks. It 
will preserve its vitality for years when prepared in this manner. 

AGARICUS COMATUS MUSHROOM. 

No. 870. This is an excellent variety that is found in abundance 
in stumps of trees in pastures, appearing in spring and autumn. It 
is much used in catsup, but should only be used when young. 

SWEET OR DELICIOUS MUSHROOM. 



No. 871. This is a variety of medium size, having a yellowish 
color ringed with orange on the top. It somewhat resembles a del- 
eterious species, but is readily distinguished from it, as when it is

while the juice of the noxious kind is white and unchangeable. It 
is found in the fall of the year, growing under lir or pine tives. 

THE ST. GEORGE MUSHROOM. 

No. 872. This is a variety that attains a weight of four or five 
pounds in California, but is not as delicate as the common Mush- 
room. Those grown in Europe are superior to the common Mush- 
room in flavor and are more digestible. It grows in rings in pas- 
tures or in thickets under trees, and reappears for successive years 
on the same spot. 

BLEWIT'S BLUE HATS. 

No. 873. This is a favorite species, and is sold largely in the 
markets. It has a soft, moist, smooth pileus, with a solid bulbous 
stem, tinted with light blue. The gills are of a dingy white color, 
-and rounded towards the stem. It should only be gathered in dry 
weather, as it absorbs moisture readily, and thereby is injured in 
flavor and rendered more liable to decay. 

AGARICUS PRIMULAS. 

No. 874. This variety is found only in spring, and grows in rings 
on the borders of woodlands, at which time an abundance of its 
spawn can be obtained. It may be preserved by transplanting it 
into bricks of loam and horse manure, in which it will keep for 
several months, the same as the spawn of common Mushrooms. 
This variety is used both in its fresh and dried state. It is preserved 
by bein cut into quarters, and then dried in the air for several 
days, when it is strung up and kept for future use. 

THE FAIRY KING. 

No. 875. This Mushroom is found growing in rings, and has a 
pileus of a brownish ochre color, which changes to a paler cast as 
it grows, until it gradually fades into a rich, creamish yellow color. 
It is of excellent flavor, and is valuable for domestic use, owing to 
the facility with which it is dried, and its extensive dissemination. 
It may be kept for years without losing its aroma or flavor. 

NOTE. The Boletus, Clavaria, and Morel varieties of Mushrooms will be found under their 
respective headings. 

HOW TO CLEAN AND PREPARE MUSHROOMS. 

No. 876. Mushrooms should be used as soon as they are gathered. 
Put the solid ones in one pan, and those that are hollow in another, 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE. 203 

having two quarts of acidulated water in each pan. Wash them 
well, then trim them and put them in separate pans again, that 
contain acidulated water. Let them soak for a while until ready 
lo use them. The small, solid button Mushrooms will resemble the 
cultivated French Mushrooms when cooked, and may be used for 
sauces and small garnitures. Cut off the stems of the hollow ones 
before washing them. The heads are used for stuffing, and are also 
broiled. The tops of the solid ones should be cut in crescent-like 
grooves, to give them a fancy appearance. The trimmings are 
chopped fine, and are used with fine herbs. 

COOKED MUSHROOMS, FOR GENERAL PURPOSES. 

No. 877. When the Mushrooms are washed and cleaned as in 
No. 876, select a saucepan that is not too large for the quantity of 
Mushrooms to be cooked. Put two pounds of fresh Mushrooms in 
the saucepan and add four ounces of butter, a quarter of a glassful 
of cold water, and the juice of two lemons. Cover the saucepan, 
put it on a brisk fire, and when the Mushrooms have boiled for two 
or three minutes, pour them into an earthen jar. When they are 
cold cover them with a buttered paper cover and keep them in a 
cool place. They may be used for any kind of sauces or garnitures. 
The juice is added to sauces to flavor them. 

NOTE. When cooking large quantities of Mushrooms, put the saucepan on the fire and add 
them when the liquid boils. A wine-glassful of water will be sufficient for five pounds of Mush- 
rooms. 

MUSHROOMS, WITH ALLEMANDE SAUCE. 

No. 878. Reduce some Allemande sauce with some Mushroom 
gravy and then add the Mushrooms. If they are small leave them 
whole; if large, cut off the stems and slice them as desired.

French MUSK MELON. German 

Melon Muscat. Melon. 

No. 908. This is a delicious species of melon; so called on 

account of its musky fragrance. Owing to the great facility with 



212 HARDER'S AMERICAN COOKERY. 

which the various kinds intermix or hybridize, the varieties are not 
only numerous, but are constantly increasing. Familiar names of 
different varieties are changed annually, as new kinds with superior 
recommendations spring up, and are offered as welcome substitutes 
for the old kinds. 

CULTURE. 

No. 909. Cultivate them as you would cucumbers, except that 
the hills should be six feet apart, but avoid planting them near 
cucumbers, as they will mix with and injure the quality of the 
melons; this, and heavy rains at the time of ripening, will destroy 
the flavor of the finest stock. Rich earth for the young plants is 
far better than manure, but if the latter must be used, see that it is 
well rotted. If the plants grow very rank, more and finer fruit will 
be secured by pinching off the ends of the shoots when about three 
feet long. Cantaloupes are cultivated in the same manner. 

BEECH WOOD MELON. 

No. 910. The melon is nearly spherical, but is somewhat longer 
than broad. The skin is of a greenish yellow color, thickly and 
regularly netted. The fiesh is green, being sugary, and of excellent 
flavor. 

CHRISTIANA. 

No. 911. This variety is small and roundish, and matures early. 
Its skin is of a yellowish green color, the flesh is yellow, sweet, and 
juicy, and of good quality. 

CITRON. 

No. 912. This is a medium sized melon, nearly round, but 
flattened slightly at the ends, being deeply and thoroughly ribbed. 
The skin is green, and thickly netted, but when fully matured it 
becomes tinged with yellow. The flesh is thick, green, and juicy, 
having a rich sugary flavor. It is a hardy abundant bearer, uniform 
in quality, and is much used in the Southern States. 

HARDY RIDGE. 

No. 913. A productive variety, having small fruit, which is 
strongly ribbed and has irregular warts all over its surface. The 
skin is of a dull yellow color. The flesh is about an inch deep, of 
a bright orange-red color, and is sweet and well flavored. 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE. 213 

LARGE RIBBED NETTED. 

No. 914. The melon is large, oval, and strongly ribbed, and is 
hardy and productive when planted in good soil. The skin is 
thickly netted and yellow in color. The flesh is of a salmon-yellow 
color, remarkably thick and sweet, but is not finely grained. 

NUTMEG. 

No. 915. The fruit is oval and regularly ribbed, and when fully 
ripened is very delicious, being ranked as one of the best kinds. 
The skin is of a pale green color, thickly netted, though somewhat 
thin. The flesh is light green, rich, sweet, juicy, and highly 
perfumed. 

PINE APPLE. 

No. 916. This variety is small and nearly round, having ribs that 
are but faintly defined and at times not being noticeable. The skin 
is thin and of an olive-green color, being more or less netted. The 
flesh is green, juicy, sweet, and highly flavored. This kind is 
easily grown and is very productive. 

SKILLMAN'S FINE NETTED. 

No. 917. This is one of the earliest sorts, somewhat resembling 
the pine apple. It is firm and almost round, being slightly flattened 
at the ends. The flesh is green, juicy, sugary, and excellent. 

VICTORY OF BATH. 

No. 918. The fruit is egg shaped and faintly ribbed, being 
rounded at the blossom end, and slightly contracted toward the 
stem. The skin is thin and green, clouded with yellow, and sparsely 
covered with fine net marks. The flesh is green. 

WHITE JAPAN. 

No. 919. This is a roundish, medium sized or small melon, which 
ripens early, is very desirable and quite productive. The skin is 
very thin and of a cream-white color, the flesh being remarkably 
sweet and finely flavored. 

MUSK MELON FOR RELISHES. 

No. 920. Musk melons, like all the different varieties of melons, 
are served as a relish, or for dessert. They should be kept in a 



214 HARDEE'S AMEEICAN COOKERY. 

cool place about an hour before serving them. Cut the melon in 
half, remove the seeds, slice it in ordinary pieces, and serve them 
on a napkin. Either sugar or pepper and salt can be used with 
.them. 

PICKLED MELONS (MANGOES). 

No. 921. The small young and green citron, or cantaloupe 
"melons, can be used. Cut out a small piece of the melon, wedge- 
shaped, so it can be replaced nicely, scoop out the seeds, replace 
the plug, and put the melons in the jar or barrel that you intend to 
fill. Make a brine, using one pound and a quarter of salt to a gallon 
of water, and boil it. Then pour it boiling hot over the melons, 
cover the barrel, and in three days drain off the brine, take the 
melons out of the barrel and stuff them the same as pickled stuffed 
bell peppers. Then put them in jars, pour some cold boiled wine 
or cider vinegar over them, to cover, put a small piece of alum in 
each jar, and cover them tightly. 

PRESERVED MELONS, SPICED. 

No. 922. Musk, citron or cantaloupe melons can be used. Cut 
the melons in quarters, take out the seeds and remove the tenderest 
part of the flesh. Then peel off the rinds and cut up about five 
pounds of the melon in scollops. Put six pounds of sugar in a 
basin, to which add five pints of vinegar. Make it boil, and pour 
it boiling hot over the melons which you have put in a jar. Drain 
off the syrup the next day, then boil it and skim it, and pour it 
boiling hot over the melons. Repeat this every day for five days. 
On the sixth day boil the syrup again, adding to it one ounce of 
white ginger, a small stick of cinnamon, six cloves, and the melons. 
Let it boil slowly for fifteen minutes, skim it clear, and then take 
it off of the fire to get cool. When cold put them in glass jars and 
cover them tightly. 

PRESERVED MELONS IN SYRUP. 

No. 923. Cut the melons in quarters, take out the seeds, and 
peel off the rinds. Parboil them for three minutes, then immerse 
them in cold water and drain them. Put them in an earthen bowl. 
Make a syrup, using three pounds of loaf sugar to one and a quarter 
pounds of water. Set it on the fire to boil, skim it well and then 
pour it boiling hot over the melons. Cover them with a paper 
cover and set them aside for twenty-four hours. Drain off the 
syrup next day and let it boil, adding some more sugar, and then let 
it boil to a thread. Set it aside to get cold and then pour it over 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE. 215 

the melons again. Boil it over again next day to the same degree, 
skimming it well, and pour it over the melons when boiling hot. 
Boil it the next day to a thick thread, skimming it well; then add 
in the melons and let the syrup boil up t .vice. On the following 
day boil the syrup again to the same degree, then add the melons 
and let them simmer slowly for five minutes. When well skimmed 
put the melons in glass jars, and when they are cold cover them 
tightly. 

NOTE. The juice of a lemon, or a little wine vinegar, can be added to the syrup when cooking 
it to heighten the flavor.

No. 924. There are five kinds of Mustard, the plant and the seed 
having a pungent taste. A condiment is made from the ground 
seeds, which are also used as remedial agents, being useful 
externally in cataplasms, and internally as a diuretic and irritant. 
The rough leaves of the White Mustard plant, when young and 
undeveloped, make a pungent salad when mixed with water cress. 
They are also cooked and prepared the same as spinach. The Black 
Mustard seed makes the most piquant Mustard for table purposes. 

CULTURE. 

No. 925. Sow the seeds thickly in rows and cut the plants when 
they are about two inches high. For a crop of seeds sow in April, 
in drills one foot apart, and thin the plants out moderately when 
they are about three inches high. For use during winter it may be 
sown at intervals in boxes, in the green house or in frames. 

WHITE MUSTAED. 

No. 926. The White Mustard plant is a hardy annual that grows 
in gardens and fields, having thin stems that attain a height of 
about three feet. The leaves are large and of a rich deep green 
color. When it is grown in gardens for salad or greens sow it as 
early as the ground will admit, in drills ten inches apart. Remove 
the weeds and water it well in dry weather. Out the plants when 
in seed leaf, as when they become developed they get strong and 
ill-flavored. 



216 HARDEB'S AMEBICAN COOKEBY. 

CHINESE OB PEKIN MUSTARD. 

No. 927. This is a hardy annual that grows about four feet high, 
and has large leaves, which are used in salad and are also prepared 
the same as spinach. 

CUELED MUSTARD. 

No. 928. This plant is small, with greenish yellow leaves of 
medium size, that are finely cut on the borders and beautifully 
curled. They have a pleasant taste when used in salads. The seeds 
resemble those of the Black Mustard. 

CUT LEAVED MUSTARD. 

No. 929. The leaves, when young, make an excellent salad when 
mixed with water cress. 

BLACK MUSTARD. 

No. 930. This is a hardy annual that grows in great abundance. 
The young plants, cut to the ground, are used the same as spinach, 
or in salads. The common table Mustard is made from the seeds 
of this variety. 

CHARLOCK MUSTARD. 

No. 931. This is a wild field plant and is used for greens or 
salad and has a peculiar pleasant taste. 

MUSTARD FLOUR MIXED FOR TABLE USE. 

No. 932. Americans generally prefer Mustard flour mixed with 
vinegar or plain with water. Epicures prefer it mixed with hot 
water and white wine, or with new wine and vinegar. French 
Mustard can be obtained from all first-class grocers. There are 
several varieties, some of which are flavored with tarragon, 
anchovies or fine herbs, etc. 

NOTE. Never use a metallic spoon in mustard as it forms verdigris when left to stand in the 
Mustard pot, and may render it poisonous. 

ANCHOVIE MUSTARD. 

No. 933. Trim one dozen of salted anchovies, pound them in a 
mortar into a fine paste, and rub the paste through a fine sieve. 
Then put it back in the mortar and add half a pound of Mustard 
flour diluted with white wine. Mix it all well together and put it 
in small bottles and cork them tightly. 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE. 217 

EAVIGOTE MUSTARD. 

No. 934. Pick half a pound of the leaves of burnet, tarragon, 
chervil, and garden cress. Dip them in boiling water for a minute, 
then immerse them in cold water, and afterwards put them in a 
towel and press out all of the moisture. Pound it finely in a mortar, 
adding a clove of garlic if that flavor is desired. Then rub it 
through a fine sieve and put it back in the mortar. Add half a 
pound of Mustard flour diluted with water, and mix the whole well 
together. Then put it in small bottles and cork them tightly. 

MUSTARD SAUCE FOR DEVILED "MEATS. 

No. 935. Put half a pound of Mustard flour in a bowl and add 
a pinch of red pepper, a little salt, and four soup-spoonfuls of Wor- 
cestershire sauce. Dilute this with wine vinegar to the consistency 
of a sauce. Put it in bottles for future use. 



ARTICLE CXXXIV. 



French NASTURTIUM. German 

Capucine. Indishe Kresse. 

No. 936. This is a climbing plant, which, though generally 
treated as an annual, is a tender perennial. It has peltate leaves 
and spurred flowers of a vivid yellow or orange color, and strong 
odor. The fleshy fruits have a warm, pungent flavor, like the cress, 
and are pickled and used the same as capers. The small green 
ones are preferred and are used in sauces and with salads. The 
young shoots are eaten as a salad, while the richly colored flowers 
make a handsome garniture for salads. 

CULTURE. 

No. 937. When they are cultivated for their flowers or seeds 
they should be planted in poor, light soil. The drills are made 
three feet apart, and the young plants should be thinned out to six 
inches apart. The young crop is supported by staking or bushing, 
the same as peas, and requires much attention. See that they are 
properly attached to the stakes, and keep the ground free from 
weeds. 



218 HARDER'S AMERICAN COOKERY. 

SMALL NASTURTIUM. 

No. 938. This is a dwarf variety, the stem rarely measuring more 
than two feet in length. The flowers are yellow and the pods are 
small, being preferred to the others for pickling. It yields 
abundantly. 

TALL NASTURTIUM. 

No. 939. This variety is very ornamental for covering arbors, 
having a stem from six to eight feet high. Sow it in rich made 
soil to have luxuriant foliage. It has large yellow flowers, with the 
upper petals slightly streaked and marked with purple. 

DARK FLOWERING. 

No. 940. This variety is similar to the Tall Nasturtium, except 
that the flowers are of a dark brown color. 

NASTURTIUM SEED BUDS, PICKLED. 

No. 941. Pick the quantity of seed buds desired, and put them 
in bottles. Boil some good wine vinegar, and when it is cold pour 
it over the seed buds in the bottles, and add a sprig of tarragon. 
They are used the same as capers.

French NETTLE. German 

Ortie. Vessel. 

No. 942. The common Nettle is a hardy, herbaceous perennial, 
which grows naturally and in abundance by the wayside, but it is 
seldom seen where people have not been at work; hence it is consid- 
ered a sort of domestic plant. The stem is erect and branching, while 
the leaves are heart-shaped at the base, toothed on the borders, and 
thickly set with small, stinging hair-like bristles. The common 
Nettle produces a large proportion of fiber, which is used in making 
ropes, cordage, sewing thread, and white linen cloth of superior 
quality. Like many other common plants the superior merit of 
these troublesome weeds has been greatly overlooked. Early in 
April the tops will furnish tender leaves that are used as a pot herb 
for soups, or are prepared the same as spinach. The cultivated 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE. 219 

Nettle is used most, being propagated from roots that- are planted 
either in pots or in the forcing house. They will soon send up an 
abundance of tender tops. They may be blanched by covering 
them with other pots. If planted close to a flue in the vineyard 
they will produce excellent Nettle-kale or Nettle-spinach in January 
or February.

French NEW ZEALAND SPINACH. German 

Epinart (Belle dame}. Spinal 

No. 943. This Spinach is quite distinct from the common garden 
Spinach, varying essentially in its general habit. It is a hardy annual 
plant, and is more productive than the average of spinaceous plants. 
The leaves are of a fine green color, large, broad, thick and fleshy. 
The leaves are the parts of the plant eaten, being gathered as they are 
developed, leaving the ends of the young shoots uninjured. If not 
cut to excess the plant will yield abundantly until destroyed by 
frost. The leaves retain their fresh, succulent character after they 
are fully grown, and even under the influence of the heat and 
draught. It is prepared the same as common garden Spinach for 
table use. 



CXXXVI I. 



NUTMEG. 

Muscade (Noix). Muskatennus. 

No. 944. The Nutmeg tree is about thirty feet high, with 
numerous branches, and an aspect somewhat resembling that of the 
orange tree. The leaves stand alternately on short foot stalks, and 
are oblong-oval, pointed, entire, undulated, bright green and some- 
what glossy on their upper surface, whitish beneath, and of an 
aromatic taste. The flowers are male and female on different trees. 
The former are disposed in axillary, peduncled, solitary clusters, 
and the latter are single, solitary, and axillary, Both are minute 
and of a pale yellowish color. The fruit which appears on the tree 
mingled with the flowers, is round or oval; of the size of a small 
peach, smooth, at first pale green, but yellow when ripe, and marked 
with a longitudinal furrow. The external covering, which is at first 



220 HARDER'S AMERICAN COOKERY. 

thick and fleshy, and abounds in an austere, astringent juice, 
afterwards becomes dry and coriaceous, and, separating into two 
valves from the apex, discloses a scarlet, reticulated membrane, 
commonly called mace, closely investing a thin, brown, shining 
shell, which contains the kernel or Nutmeg. It is a native of the 
Moluccas and other neighboring islands, and abounds in the Banda 
Islands, whence the chief supplies of Nutmegs were long derived. 
Numerous varieties are cultivated in Sumatra, Java, Penang, Ceylon, 
and other parts of the East Indies, and have been introduced into 
the Isles of France and Bourbon, Cayenne, and several of the West 
India islands. The Penang Nutmegs are distinguished by not being 
limed. When Nutmeg is cut or broken it presents a yellowish 
surface, varied with a reddish brown, branching, irregular veins, 
which give to it a marbled appearance. These dark veins abound 
in oily matter, upon which the medicinal properties depend. The 
odor of Nutmeg is delightfully fragrant, the taste warm, aromatic, 
and grateful. Its virtues are extracted by alcohol and ether. The 
largest Nutmegs are the most expensive. They should be rejected 
when very light, with a feeble taste and smell, worm eaten, musty, 
or marked with black veins. Nutmeg has considerable narcotic 
power, and when taken in doses of from two to three drams will 
produce stupor and delirium, and dangerous if not fatal conse- 
quences. It is frequently used as an agreeable addition to 
farinaceous articles of diet, and to various kinds of drink in cases 
of languid appetite and delicate stomach. It is usually given in 
substance, and is brought by grating to the state of a powder. Its 
pleasant flavor makes it invaluable in cookery for seasoning. Nut- 
meg should always be purchased entire, as when it is ground it soon 
loses its strength. To ascertain if they are fresh stick a pin in one, 
and if the pin is oily when you withdraw it the Nutmeg is fresh. 
When dry they are of no use.

French OATS. German 

Farine D'Avoine,. Hafermehl. 

No. 946. The common white Oat is specifically distinguished by 
its loose panicle, its two-seeded glumes, and its smooth seeds, one 
of which is awned. It is cultivated all over the world chiefly for 
horses, but the grain is very nourishing and is largely consumed as 
food in Great Britain and other countries. A decoction is said to 
possess decided diuretic properties, and to be useful in dropsy. 
The seeds deprived of their husks are sometimes called groats. As 
a food coarsely ground Oat meal is usually preferred to the fine meal. 
Oat meal is very slightly, but not unpleasantly, bitter, and yields 
most of its nutritive matter readily to boiling water. Gruel made 
from Oat meal affords a nutritious and easily digested aliment. It 
is generally administered after brisk cathartics to render them 
easier and more efficient in their action. 

BLACK CHAMPION. 

No. 947. This new Oat possesses great merit. Its tillering 
properties are remarkable. The heads, or panicles, are long and 
very spreading, averaging sixty or seventy spikelets, from twelve to 
eighteen inches in length, with two large grains to each spinkelet. 
The kernels are extra large, plump and heavy, black and glossy; 
are without awns, while the husk is thin and soft. The straw is 
from three to six feet long, stiff and elastic, does not lodge, and so 
far seems to be rust-proof. Only half the quantity of seed should 
be sown, compared with other sorts. 

AMEEICAN TRIUMPH. 

No. 948. This variety has many excellent qualities. Its average 
height when standing in the field is six feet, yet the straw is so 
strong anil firm that it holds up well, without lodging. The tall, 
luxuriant heads are filled with plump, heavy grains. 



222 HAEDEE'S AMERICAN COOKERY, 

RUSSIAN WHITE OATS. 

No. 949. This grain is very productive, a single grain giving 
sixteen stalks in many instances. It is generally free from rust, 
and is well adapted for general use. 

GRUEL. 

No. 950. Gruel is prepared in different ways with oat ( meal flour, 
and with the grain. Use fresh flour only, as it is liable to have a 
sour taste, if not kept in a dry, warm place. When using flour the 
gruel is prepared with water, milk or broth, then sweetened with 
sugar or honey, and flavored with the juice of a lemon. When 
making gruel from the whole grains steep them in cold water over 
night, then drain them and let them cook slowly in water or milk, 
and when cooked strain the gruel through a towel with pressure, and 
sweeten to taste. 

OAT MEAL GRUEL. 

No. 951. Oat meal gruel may be prepared by boiling an ounce 
of meal with three pints of water to a quart, straining the decoction, 
allowing it to stand until it cools, and then pouring oflf the clear 
liquor from the sediment. Sugar and lemon juice may be added 
to improve its flavor; raisins are not unfrequently boiled with the 
meal and water for the same purpose. 

SCOTCH OAT MEAL GRUEL. 

No. 952. Soak one pound of Oat meal over night, then strain the 
liquid through a towel, with pressure, to extract as much of the 
farinaceous matter as will go through. Put one quart of water 
in a saucepan, and when it boils add a little salt and the liquid 
extracted from the Oat meal. Let it boil down until it thickens, 
and serve it hot, or allow it to cool to a jelly-like mass, and serve 
it with cream and powdered sugar. 

OAT MEAL PORRIDGE. 

No. 953. Boil two quarts of water in a sauce pan, season it with 
salt, and drop in slowly one pound of Oat meal while stirring it 
with a wooden spoon. Let it boil slowly for a few minutes, then 
set it on the side of the fire to boil slowly for three quarters of an 
hour, stirring it up occasionally from the bottom. A little milk 
and butter may be added before serving, or serve it with a pitcher 
of cream, some sugar and butter.

it well. Then let it boil slowly and add a stick of cinnamon, the peel 
of a lemon, a few coriander seeds, a pinch of salt and one of mace. 
Cover the saucepan and let it cook slowly for twenty minutes. 
Then strain it through a fine sieve, and put it back in the saucepan 
to keep warm, not allowing it to boil. Add some powdered sugar 
to sweeten it, stirring until the sugar is melted. Serve it in small 
cups.

French OKRA, OR GUMBO. German 

Gumbo. Ocher. 

No. 955. Okra is an annual plant from the West Indies and 
South America, and is largely raised in the Southern States. It is 
cultivated for its green seed pods, which are used in soups and 
served as a vegetable. The pods when young and tender should be 
cut in sections, strung on twine and hung up in the shade to cure 
(the same way as dried fruit). In this condition the Okra can be 
used for soup at any time. 

CULTURE. 

No. 956. Sow the seed thinly in dry, warm soil, in shallow drills 
two feet apart. Cover the seeds lightly, and after the plants are 
up thin them out to nine inches apart. Hoe frequently and draw 
a little earth to the stems as they continue to grow. Gather th e 
pods when quite green and about an inch and a half long. 

DWARF GREEN. 

No. 957. The earliest and best variety for the Northern or East- 
ern States. 

LONG GREEN. 

No. 958. Long, pale green and ribbed. 



224 HARDER'S AMERICAN COOKERY. 

FALL, OR GIANT ( WHITE PODDED). 

No. 959. It yields abundantly, especially in the Southern States, 
and is similar to the dwarf plant with the exception of being larger 
in size. 

STEWED OKRA, PLAIN. 

No. 960. Cut the stems from fifty Okra, and put them into a sauce- 
pan with boiling water to cover. Season with salt and cook them 
on a brisk fire until they are tender. Then drain them and dish 
them up, pouring over them a little melted butter, with which add 
the juice of a lemon and some salt and pepper. 

STEWED OKRA, WITH TOMATOES. 

No. 961. Cut the stems from two dozen Okra, put them into a 
saucepan with one dozen peeled tomatoes cut in quarters, and 
moisten with two soup-spoonfuls of water. Add a piece of butter 
and season with salt and pepper. Let them simmer for half an 
hour. 

NOTE. When cooked they may be baked by being put in a buttered deep baking dish and sprink- 
led over with fresh bread crumbs. Wipe the border, put a piece of butter on top, divided in small 
parts, and bake in a moderate oven. 

OKRA STEWED WITH FINE HERBS. 

No. 962. Cut off both ends of some Okra, wash them in cold 
water and then put them into a saucepan with a pint of boiling 
water and a little salt. Let them boil on a brisk fire, and when 
tender drain off some of the liquid, add a piece of butter and sea- 
son with salt, pepper and a little fine chopped parsley. 

OKRA SALAD. 

No. 963. When the Okra is boiled as in No. 960 drain them, and 
when cold slice them and add a few finely sliced green peppers, 
vinegar, oil and a few chopped chives. 

OKRA FOR GARNITURE. 

No. 964. When used for garniture in stews, add the Okra when 
the meats are nearly cooked. Leave the smaller pods whole and 
cut the larger ones in half. 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE. 225 

OKRAFOE SOUP. 

No. 965. Cut the Okra in slices an eighth of an inch thick and 
add them to the soup fifteen minutes before serving. Let it boil 

slowly. 

DEY OKRA, ITS USE. 

No. 966. Dry Okra is used for soup when the green variety is 
not to be had. Wash it in cold water and let it soak for an hour, 
then proceed as above, care being taken to have only a good qual- 
ity or the Okra will taste like hay. "When the best quality of canned 
Okra can be had it will be found far superior to the dry, and it 
needs only to be added to the soup a few minutes before serving. 

OKRA, OR GUMBO SOUP, WITH CHICKEN. 

No. 967. Cut two tender chickens into small pieces, about three 
quarters of an inch thick, and put them in a saucepan with a piece 
of butter. Fry them lightly and then add two medium-sized onions, 
chopped finely, with half their quantity of lean, raw ham, cut the 
same way. Cook them for a few minutes, then moisten with a 
gallon of chicken or veal broth. When it boils skim off the grease 
and add a faggot of parsley garnished with celery and a leek. 
Season with salt and pepper, add two green peppers cut into small 
slices and set it on the side of the fire to boil slowly. When the 
chicken is half cooked add one dozen of peeled tomatoes cut in 
quarters (or if they are large into six parts), with four ounces of 
Carolina rice and about fifty sliced Okra. When they are cooked 
skim the soup, take out the faggot, and serve. When properly 
cooked the broth will be found to have a mucilaginous consistency.

French ONIONS. German 

Oignun. Zwiebeln. 

No. 968. The Onion is a half-hardy biennial plant. The roots 
and leaves, however, are annual, as they usually perish during the 
first year. The bulbs, for which the plant is generally cultivated, 
are biennial, and differ to a considerable extent in their size, form, 
and color. It contains considerable nutriment and has valuable 
15 



226 HARDER'S AMEEICAN COOKERY. 

medicinal qualities. The disagreeable odor it imparts to the breath 
may be avoided in a great measure by thorough cooking, or by 
eating a few leaves of parsley. Much depends upon the climate 
and soil as well as the quality of seed, which exerts a great influence 
on the crop, and to this end great care should be exercised in 
selecting the seed. The white Onion is much sweeter than the red. 
Onions are used more than any other vegetable for culinary 
purposes. 

PREPARATION OF THE SOIL. 

No. 969. A good crop of Onions can be raised in any soil which 
will produce a full crop of corn, unless it be stiff clay, very light 
sand or gravel, or certain varieties of muck or swamp land. There 
is no crop in which the quality of the manure used is of greater 
importance than in this. If it is too rank it is quite sure to make 
soft Onions, with many scullions. It should be fermented during 
the previous summer to kill the wheat seeds. All refuse of the 
previous crop should be removed, the manure spread evenly, and 
the ground plowed a moderate depth, in order to thoroughly mix the 
manure with the soil. Cultivate as early in the spring as the ground 
will permit. It is impossible to cultivate the crop economically 
unless the rows are perfectly straight, and to secure this, stretch a 
line along one side, fourteen feet from the edge, and make a distinct 
mark as a guide. Then having made a wooden marker something 
like a giant rake (with five teeth about a foot long, and fourteen 
inches apart), make four more marks by carefully drawing it with 
the outside tooth in the line and the head at right angles to the 
perfectly straight mark made by the line. Continue to work around 
this line until on the third passage of the marker you reach the 
side of the field where you began. Measure fifteen feet two inches 
from the last row, stretch the line again and mark around in the 
same way. This is much better than to stretch a line along one 
side. Sow the seed as soon as the ground is read}', which can be 
done best by a hand seed drill. 

CULTURE. 

No. 970. As soon as the Onions are up so they can be seen the 
length of the rows, hoe them by just skimming the ground between 
the rows. A few days after give them the second hoeing. This 
time hoe close up to the plants. After this weeding must commence, 
which should be done thoroughly and carefully, stirring the earth 
around the plants in order to destroy any weeds that have just 
started and cannot be seen. In about two weeks they will require 
another hoeing and weeding, similar to the last, and two weeks 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE. 227 

later another if necessary. If the work is carefully done the crop 
will need no further attention until ready to gather. Then, as soon 
as the tops die and fall, the crop should be gathered by pulling 
four rows and laying them in one row (the tops all one way), and 
then forming a similar row with the tops in the opposite direction. 
If the weather is fine they will require no attention, while curing, 
but if not they will need to be stirred, by simply moving them 
slightly along the row. When the tops are perfectly dry cut them 
off half an inch from the bulb and throw each pair of rows together, 
forming windrows about nine feet apart. After a few days of bright 
weather they will be fit to store away. 

HOW TO KEEP ONIONS THROUGH THE WINTER. 

No. 971. It is essential for the preservation of Onions to keep 
them dry, to have thorough ventilation, and to keep them free from 
frost. One of the most popular methods of keeping Onions is to 
spread straw to the depth of fifteen inches on a dry floor and upon 
this spread the Onions ten inches deep and cover them with one foot 
of straw. They will then keep in fine condition for months. Upon 
the approach of cold weather close the doors and windows, keeping 
the temperature just above the freezing point. With proper care 
they can be kept sound until spring. 

REMARKS ON SMALL ONIONS. 

No. 972. It is difficult to grow Onions from seed in certain 
localities, while from sets good Onions are grown quite early. The 
sets are little Onions grown up the previous year and taken up when 
as large as peas. When set out in the spring they very soon form 
good large Onions. There are two kinds of Onions that are not 
grown from seed, the Potato and the Top Onion. The Potato 
Onion grows in clusters under the ground. These little bulbs are 
planted in the spring and produce large Onions. The large Onions 
are planted the next spring and produce the clusters. The Top 
Onion produces the small clusters on the top of the stem, where 
the seed is produced in the common varieties. These small Onions, 
are planted in the spring and the result is full grown Onions; the 
large ones with a year's growth produce the clusters. 

EARLY RED GLOBE. 

No. 973. This variety is globe-shaped and very handsome in 
appearance. The skin has a deep red color, and the flesh is mild 
and tender. 



228 HARDER'S AMERICAN COOKERY. 

EXTRA EARLY RED. 

No. 974. A medium-sized flat variety, producing abundantly and 
very desirable for early use. It is uniform in shape, of moderate 
size and is strongly flavored. 

LARGE RED WETHERFIELD. 

No. 975. This is a standard and favorite variety in the East and 
is excellent for exportation. It is very productive, generally of 
large size and keeps well. It is almost round, being a little flat- 
tened. The skin is of a purplish red color and the flavor is strong. 

LARGE YELLOW DUTCH. 

No. 876. One of the oldest and best known varieties. It is 
mild and well flavored, having white, finely grained flesh. 

YELLOW DANVERS. 

No. 977. This is a fine globular variety of medium size. The 
skin is of a yellowish-brown color, and the flesh is white with a 
mild flavor. 

WHITE PORTUGAL, SILVER SKIN. 

No. 978. This is a large, flat and mild flavored Onion, that is 
much esteemed for pickling, and keeps better than any of the white 
Onions. 

WHITE SILVER SKIN, FOR PICKLING. 

No. 979. This is a large Onion, and is preferred to any other 
kind for pickling. It is handsome in appearance. 

WHITE GLOBE. 

No. 980. This variety yields abundantly, producing handsome 
globe-shaped bulbs. The flesh is firm, finely grained and of mild 
flavor. 

LARGE MEXICAN. 

No. 981. This variety attains a diameter of six inches, and 
weighs from three to four pounds. It is usually eaten raw, having 
white, coarsely-grained flesh of mild flavor. The skin is generally 
white, and sometimes of a light reddish color. 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE. 229 

EARLY NEOPOLITAN MAEZAJOLA. 

No. 982. A beautiful white-skinned flat variety, and a good 
keeper. If it is sown in February or March, a crop will mature 
early in the season. 

GIANT EOCCA. 

No. 983. This variety is well adapted for culinary purposes, 
having a mild flavor, tender flesh and a light brown skin. It pro- 
duces large globular Onions from seed the first season, but to attain 
its largest growth, the smallest bulbs should be set out the next 
spring, when they will continue increasing in size instead of pro- 
ducing seed. 

GIANT "WHITE ITALIAN TEIPOLI. 

No. 984. This is a large, beautiful, pure white flat variety, that 
will produce large Onions from seed, but to attain their largest size 
the small bulbs should be set out the following spring. The flavor 
is mild and excellent. 

NEW QUEEN. 

No. 985. This variety grows quickly and keeps well. If sown 
in February, it will produce Onions two inches in diameter early 
in summer. If sown in July, they will be ready to pull out in 
autumn, and will be sound and fit for use until the following 
autumn. If sown thickly, they will mature perfectly hard. They 
are particularly valuable for pickling. 

BED, YELLOW OR WHITE BOTTOM SETS. 

No. 986. The sets are produced by sowing the seed very thickly 
in the spring, without thinning them out; they mature when about 
one inch up. Their use is precisely the same as the Top Onions 
to set them out in the spring instead of sowing seed. The seed of 
the White Silver Skin or the White Portugal varieties, is used for 
the White Set. They do not keep as well as the others, but produce 
small white Onions early in the season. 

ENGLISH MULTIPLIER. 

No. 987. Esteemed by man} r as the best variety for early use. 
It is large in size, of a mild, sweet sugary flavor, very early and a 
large producer. The large Onions produce several small Onions 
in clusters around the bulb, growing mostly on the top of the 
ground.

POTATO ONION. 

No. 988. This variety produces a quantity of young bulbs on 
'the root, which should only be planted in spring, six inches apart, 
in rows that are eighteen inches wide, under one inch of soil. The 
English Multiplier should be planted in the same way. The large 
bulbs produce small Onions and the small bulbs large ones. 

PLAIN BOILED ONIONS. 

No. 989. Peel two dozen medium-sized Onions, cut off the roots 
and stems and be careful not to injure the skin. Put them in a 
saucepan, cover them with water, add a little salt and a piece of

with a piece of butter, season with salt and sprinkle them with a 
little powdered sugar. Moisten them, to cover, with broth (or 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE. 231 

water) , put them on a brisk fire and when the moisture is half 
reduced, set them in a moderate oven, occasionally shaking them 
over. When the moisture is reduced to a glaze roll the Onions in it 
so as to glaze them evenly, and use them as needed. 

NOTE. When they are to be serve 1 with a sauce, dish up the Onions when they are cooked and 
glazed, and aid to the glaze two soup-spoonfuls of Espagnole sauce, and one of gravy. Then let it 
boil slowly, skim off the grease, reduce it to its consistency and pour it over the Onions. 

STUFFED ONIONS. 

No. 994. Take half a dozen white Onions of equal size, peel them 
carefully, but do no not cut the end parts too deep. Parboil them 
for ten minutes in water lightly salted; to which add a piece of

ONIONS FOE GARNITURE. 

No. 1001. Onions for garniture are prepared in various ways. 
The small white or button Onion is used most. "When they are 
peeled, parboil them for five minutes and drain them on a napkin. 
Then put them in a flat saucepan with a piece of butter, a pinch of 
sugar and a little salt, and moisten them to cover with white broth. 
Set them in a moderate oven to glaze, tossing them over occasionally, 
so they will glaze evenly. These Onions are used with stews, beef 
a la mode, and for mixed vegetable garnitures. For large garni- 
tures the stuffed Onions may be used. For chops or small 
entrees the white or brown puree of Onions soubise is used. 
Small Onions, when plainly boiled aud tossed over the fire (with the 
addition of a little Cream or Allemande sauce), may also be used. 

SMALL ONIONS BAKED FOR GARNITURE, SPANISH STYLE. 

No. 1002. Select two dozen small white Onions of equal size. 
Put them in a pan and bake them without peeling. When they are 
three-quarters done, peel and put them in a flat saucepan with half

it isAxeduced to one-third, skim off the grease and strain the gravy 
through a towel. 

ONION GRAVY WITH SAGE. 

No. 1004. Chop three Onions finely with one dozen green sage 
leaves, and put them in a saucepan with a piece of butter. Cover the 
saucepan, and let them simmer slowly. When the Onions are nearly 
cooked (without being browned), add one pint of veal gravy, and

green salads, and is preferred by many who do not like raw Onions. 

ONIONS CHOPPED, FOR FINE HERBS, ETC. 

No. 1006. Onions should never be chopped (as would be im- 
plied by the term chop), but should be finely cut with a knife. 
"When the Onions are peeled, cut them in halves, take one part and 
slice it finely without detaching the pieces; then slice it the same 
way crosswise; then cut straight down. In this way you can make 
the pieces of any desired size, and will always have them uniform 
and perfectly square. If chopped Onions are to be kept for some 
time, dip them in boiling water for one minute, then immerse them 
in cold water, drain them on a towel, and wring the moisture from 
them. In this manner, the Onions will remain white. If treated 
differently, they will soon turn black. 

NEW GREEN ONIONS FOR RELISH. 

No. 1007. Remove the outer skin, trim off the tops, wash them 
in cold water, then drain and serve them plain, or slice them. 
Season with salt, pepper, vinegar and oil. Serve them in relish 
dishes, the same as cucumbers. 

ONION PEELINGS, THEIR USE. 

No. 1008. The Bed Onion peeling is used for coloring Easter 
eggs. Wash the eggs clean and dry them with a towel, being 
careful not to crack them. Put them in a saucepan with plenty of 
the onion peeling, add cold water to cover them, and set them on 
the fire to boil slowly for ten minutes. Then take them off of the

Frcucli PARSLEY. German 

Persil. Petersilie. 

No. 1033. Parsley is one of the most useful vegetables. Its 
leaves are used in cookery for garnishing and flavoring purposes, 
and its roots are used in medicine as an aperient. It is a native of 
Sardinia, but flourishes in almost every part of the world. It is an 
umbelliferous plant having a biennial root, with an annual, round, 
furrowed, jointed, erect, branching stem, about two feet in height. 
All parts of the plant contain a volatile oil, to which it owes its 
odor and mainly its taste. It excites the appetite and accelerates 
digestion. There are six varieties. 

CULTURE. 

No. 1034. The seed is slow in germinating, and should be sown 
early in spring, in rich, mellow soil. When the plants are two 
inches high transplant them. The oftener they are transplanted 
and cut back the finer and more perfect the leaves will be. Hand- 
some foliage is formed when the plants are well grown. 

FINE TRIPLED CURLED. 

No. 1035. This is a fine dwarfish curled variety, which, when 
well grown, resembles a tuft of finely curled moss. It is hardy and 
slow in running to seed, but is liable to degenerate, as it constantly 
tends to increase in size and to become less curled.

242 HAEDEE'S AMEEICAN COOKEEY. 

FAGGOT OF PAESLEY. 

No. 1039. A faggot of Parsley generally consists of a bunch of 
green Parsley, in the center of which a bay leaf, a sprig of thyme, 
and a few grains of cloves are put, the bunch being tied together 
with a string. It is used for flavoring soups, stews, etc. The edges 
should always be nicely trimmed. Celery and leeks are sometimes 
added to the faggot. 

CHOPPED PAESLEY. 

No. 1040. Take fresh Parsley leaves, wash them in cold water 
and dry them on a towel. Chop them finely on a clean board, then 
put the Parsley in a towel and wring out all of the moisture. Then 
put it in a bowl and keep it ready for use. When chopped Parsley 
is used for sauces it should be dipped in boiling water for a minute, 
then immersed in cold water and wrung dry in a towel. By doing 
this it will retain its green color. 

FEIED PAES EY FOE GAENISHING. 

No. 1041. Pick and wash a bunch of Parsley and dry it in a 
towel. Have some hot lard or grease in a frying-pan on the fire, 
and put the Parsley into it. As soon as it is crisp, take it out and 
drain it on a napkin. Care must be taken to have the lard or 
grease very hot, as one minute is sufficient to fry the Parsley, 
which, if fried longer, will turn to a dark brown color. If the 
Parsley is not fresh, it will assume the same color. 

PAESLEY FOE GAENISHING. 

No. 1042. Take one bunch of curled Parsley, wash it in cold 
water, drain it and put it in a bowl with a piece of ice. When Pars- 
ley remains in water too long, it acquires a bad odor. When gar- 
nishing dishes, which are to be covered and have to remain for 
some time before serving, it is best to use fried Parsley. Fresh 
Parsley is best as a garniture for cold dishes of meat. Parsley 
stems are cut two inches long and put into croquettes, when 
made in pear-shape, to imitate pear stems.

as a vegetable and as an ingredient in soups. 

CULTURE. 

No. 1044. Parsnips succeed best in a deep, free, rich soil. That 
which has been heavily manured for a previous crop should be 
selected. Sow them in drills from fifteen to eighteen inches apart, 
as early in spring as the ground can be found in fair working con- 
dition. When the plants are about two inches high thin them out 
to six or eight inches apart. The roots are hardy and improve by 
remaining in the ground through the winter.

Patience. Gartenampfer . 

No 1053. A hardy perennkil plant, not cultivated much in this 
country. When fully developed it is from four to five feet high. 
The leaves, which are large, long and broad pointed, are more 
succulent and tender, and attain a much larger size, when the flow- 
ering shoots are cut off as they make their appearance. The plant 
is hardy, and if cut over regularly will continue healthy and 
productive for a few years. The leaves are used the same as. 
spinach, and are put forth quite early in spring. They should be.

CLI. 



Trench PEA-NUT. German 

Aractiis. Erdnus. 

No. 1054. The Pea-nut is an annual plant, a native of Central 
America and Africa. The stem, when full grown, is about fourteen 
inches in height. The leaves are primate, with four leaflets, and a 
leafy, emarginate appendage at the base of the petals. The fruit 
or pod is of an oblong form, often contracted at the middle, but 
sometimes of bottle form, reticulated, and of a yellowish color. 
The kernels, of which the pod contains from one to three, are 
oblong, quite white, and are enclosed in a thin brown skin or 
pellicule. A remarkal^le peculiarity of this plant is that the lower 
blossoms alone produce the fruit. After the decay of the petals 
the ovaries insinuate themselves into the ground, beneath which at 
a depth of several inches, the fruit is afterwards perfected. They 
are eaten roasted, and are used by confectioners, and for culinary 
purposes as a substitute for almonds. 

CULTUEE. 

No. 10-35. The Pea-nut succeeds well only in warm climates. 
Plant them as early as the weather becomes suitable, in a warm, 
light, loamy soil, deeply ploughed and pulverized, in rows a foot 
apart. In planting, the Pea-nut should be unbroken in the pod, and 
as soon as the flower appears the vines are earthed lip from time to 
time, so as to keep them chiefly within the ground. 

AFRICAN PEA-NUT. 

No. 1056. A comparatively small, smooth, and regularly formed 
sort. The shell is thin, usually enclosing two kernels. 

WILMINGTON PEA-NUT. 

No. 1057. Similar to the African. The pods, however, are 
longer, and the shell thicker and paler. They enclose two or three 
kernels. They are cultivated largely in the Southern States. 



246 BARBER'S AMERICAN COOKERY. 

TENNESSEE PEA-NUT. 

No. 1058. The pods are large, thick, and irregular in form, and 
usually contain two kernels. This variety is less esteemed than the 
others.

French PEAS. German 

Pois. Erbsen. 

No. 1059. The Pea is a hardy annual plant, and its cultiva- 
tion is almost universal. The green Pea is a delicious vegeta- 
ble, and is highly esteemed for its flavor and taste. To have them 
in perfection they must be plucked before they mature, and should 
be shelled and cooked as soon after as possible, as they lose much 
of their tenderness and flavor if kept for any length of time. The 
fact that those brought from a distance seldom reach the markets 
in their perfect state is an objection to their use, which, coupled 
with the knowledge that when they are closely packed they become 
intensely overheated and are rendered devoid of taste and unwhole- 
some, deters many from using this popular vegetable. When sent 
from a distance they should be packed in open baskets (not in boxes, 
barrels or sacks), and laid in layers two inches deep, alternating 
with layers of clean straw. There are hundreds of varieties, but 
they differ very little from each other. New kinds are introduced 
annually, each claiming to be superior sorts, but the locality has a 
great deal to do with their quality. The field Peas can be used in 
their dry state for purees and soups, but they are not as easily 
digested as the other kinds. 

CULTURE. 

No. 1060. Peas come earliest to maturity in light rich soil. For 
a general crop a deep loam or a soil strongly inclining to clay is best. 
For an early crop decomposed leaves or leaf mold should be used, 
or, if the soil is very poor, stronger manure may be used. For 
general crops a good dressing should be applied, and for the dwarf 
growing kinds the soil cannot be too rich. When grown as a 
maiket crop Peas are never staked, and are sown in single rows 
two or three inches deep and from two to three feet apart, according 
to variety or the strength of the soil. When grown in small 
quantities for private use, they are generally sown in double rows 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OP TASTE. 247 

sis or eight inches apart, and the tall varieties are staked up with 
brush. For an early crop sow them in February, March or April, 
according to latitude, as soon as the ground can be worked. Make 
repeated sowings every two weeks in succession. After the first of 
June, sowing should be discontinued until the middle of August, 
when a good crop may sometimes be secured by sowing an early 
sort.

PEPPER. 

Poivre et Pimml. Pfeffer. 

No. 1096. There are many varieties of Pepper, both annual and 
perennial, the latter being of a shrubby or woody character, and 
as it is a tropical plant, it is tender. The annual varieties can be 
grown in the Middle and Southern States successfully. 

The annual, or common garden Pepper, is a native of India. 

Pepper is used more than any other spice. There are three kinds 
in use the White, Black, and Red. It facilitates digestion and 



254 HARDER'S AMERICAN COOKERY. 

corrects flatulency. In warm countries it is used in great quantities, 
but for good cooking it should be used with moderation, and 
persons of nervous debility should abstain from using any. For 
persons living on plain food, and having out-of-door work, it 
imparts vitality, and is very beneficial. There are also a large 
variety of Peppers eaten and prepared in their^ green state, and put 
up like pickles. The large Bell Peppers are stuffed and used as a 
vegetable, and are also excellent for pickling, and when sliced are 
much esteemed in salads, in connection with tomatoes and cucumbers. 

CULTURE. 

No. 1097. Sow in hot beds early in April, and transplant to the 
open ground when the weather is favorable. They should be

the size of a large red currant, and of a brilliant scarlet hue. 
They are produced in the greatest profusion, and will be found 
useful in the preparation of pepper sauces, and when pickled as 
soon as plucked. To prepare them for use in their dry state, it is 
only necessary to cut the plants close to the roots when the fruit is 
ripe. String the berries and hang them up in a warm, dry room. 
They will retain their piquancy for years. The plant is so beautiful 
that when grown in pots it will always prove ornamental; the 
glossy, coral red of the numerous pods presenting a fine contrast 
to the deep green foliage surrounding them.

French POTATOES. German 

Pomme de terre. Kartoffeln, 

No. 1132. The Potato is an esculent and farinaceous plant, and a 
native of South America. In its wild, natural state, the tuber rarely 
exceeds an inch in diameter, and is comparativelv unpalatable, 
but owing to cultivation they have greatly increased both in size 
and variety. There are over two hundred varieties, some of which 
are far superior to others, much depending on the culture and the 
soil in which they are grown. They are considered the most impor- 
tant of all the esculent roots, and a valuable article of human subsist- 
ence. The Potato is a healthful and nourishing vegetable, being 
agreeable to most all constitutions. It can be obtained throughout 
the year, and may be prepared without much trouble. The Potato 
is also used for other preparations. The Potato flour (fecula) is 
used by invalids and confectioners, and is mixed into the prepara- 
tions of the common sorts of chocolate.. The Potato blossom is 
used in making paint, and the leaves when dried are used by tobac- 
conists. * 

CULTURE. 

No. 1133. The soil best suited for the Potato is of the drier and 
lighter description; pasture land or new land with the turf freshly 
turned, producing the most abundant as well as the most certain 
crop. When grown in land of a stiff clayish texture, or in wet soils, 
they are not only extremely liable to disease, but the quality is also 
very inferior. If the soil is good but little manure will be required. 
In highly enriched soil the plants appear to be more liable to dis- 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE. 263 

ease than when grown in soil that is naturally good. The best 
fertilizers are those of a dry or absorbent nature, such as plaster 
lime, superphosphate of lime, and bone dust. For wet soil these 
are particularly beneficial, as they not only promote growth, but 
prevent disease. The Potato is propagated from tubers, which are 
either divided into sets, or planted entire. Whichever practice 
may be adopted, experience has proven that plants from well ripened 
tubers are not only more healthful and more productive, but actually 
come to perfection earlier than those produced from immature sets. 
Potatoes are usually planted either in hills or ridges, the former 
method being the most common in this country. If planted in hills 
they should be made three feet apart, on light warm soil. They 
require covering nearly four inches deep, but in cold, wet situations 
two and a half inches will be sufficient. Cultivation should be 
commenced as soon as the young shoots are fairly above the surface, 
and as the season advances gather the earth gradually about the 
hills or long drills, adding a little at each successive hoeing for the 
support of the growing plants, and to encourage the development 
of the rich roots, for it is at the extremity of the roots that the 
tubers are found. After the appearance of the blossoms cultivation 
should be discontinued, and no further attention will be required 
until the time for harvesting. The season of maturity of the 
earlier sorts will be indicated by the decay of the plants. The 
later sorts will continue their growth until checked by frost, pre- 
vious to which time they will not be ready for harvesting. New 
Potatoes may be had in the Southern States and in California in 
February and March, and in the Northern States as early as May 
or June, when the weather is practicable. 

The table should be supplied from day to day directly from the 
field or garden, as the tubers rapidly deteriorate after being taken 
from the ground, especially if exposed to a warm, light atmosphere, 
or when kept in a warm, dry cellar. In the preservation of potatoes 
it is of the first importance that they be excluded from light (if this 
is neglected they become injured). Fermentation is also an im- 
portant evil to be guarded against, as it changes the whole substance 
of the Potato. Of the many old and new varieties that claim public 
favor the following are selected : 

EAELY MAYFLOWER. 

No. 1134. Ripens very early, and in quality is claimed to be 
equal to the Snowflake. It is, in fact, a cross between the Snow- 
flake and Peachblow. The tubers are of medium size and run very 
uniform, being slightly flattened, oval shaped, and of a light lemon 
color. The skin is well covered with very fine netting, and has 



264 HARDER'S AMERICAN COOKERY. 

very few eyes. The flesh is white and solid. It cooks evenly and 
thoroughly, without falling to pieces, and has no hard core, so com- 
mon to other sorts. 

WALL'S ORANGE. 

No. 1135. Unsurpassed as a table variety. Its color is very 
distinct, being of a decided orange hue, from which it derives its 
name. It is unequaled in quality and productiveness, and one of 
the strongest growers. 

JUMBO. 

No. 1136. This is one of the largest growing Potatoes in cultiva- 
tion, being at least one-third larger than the Peerless. It seems to 
be entirely free from rot and is one of the very best keepers. The 
tubers are nearly round, the skin white, the eyes small and sunken 
and the flesh white and of excellent flavor. Either baked or boiled 
they are dry and mealy. 

CHAMPION OF AMERICA. 

No. 1137. The tubers are flesh-colored and the eyes carmine, 
small and even with the surface. It grows to an immense size on 
strong ground, producing tubers as heavy as three pounds in weight. 
It is a tremendous yielder, one of the best of keepers, and is not to 
be excelled for cooking purposes. 

ROCHESTER FAVORITE. 

No. 1138. A late variety that is white, oval-oblong and very 
uniform in size. An immense yielder and a handsome variety, 
excellent for table use. 

SAINT PATRICK. 

No. 1139. A handsome, smooth and regular variety, with very 
few and shallow eyes. A large yielder and of the best quality; 
excellent either baked or broiled being dry and mealy. 

BEAUTY OF HEBRON. 

No. 1140. One of the best early sorts with white skin and flesh. 
A good keeper, excellent for table use, either baked or boiled. 

EARLY ROSE. 

No. 1141. The leading variety for earliness, quality and pro- 
ductiveness. 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE. 265 

WHITE EOSE. 

No. 1142. A second early variety of medium size, very uniform 
and finely formed, with white skin slightly russeted. 

LATE EOSE. 

No. 1143. The best of the late varieties. 

PEEELESS.

SNOWFLAKE. 

No. 1145. A variety of medium earliness and unsurpassed for 
mealiness and delicacy of flavor. 

EAELY TELEPHONE. 

No. 1146. One of the best yielders, producing from one planted 
tuber as many as thirty or forty of good quality. 

VEEMONT CHAMPION. 

No. 1147. Grows to an immense size; of fine shape and a good 
yielder. 

PEACH BLOW. 

No. 1148. This variety is well known, as it is planted in immense 
quantities all over the country. It is very productive and ripens 
about the same time as the Burbank. The tubers are of medium 
size, oval-oblong, and very handsomely formed. A good keeper, 
and one of the very best for transportation. 

MAMMOTH PEAEL. 

No. 1149. The skin is white, the tubers medium in size, and the 
eyes are quite even with the surface. An excellent variety for 
table use, being exceedingly floury and well flavored. 

EAELY GEM. 

No. 1150. One of "[the best early Potatoes, of medium size, oval- 
oblong in form and very smooth. The eyes are shallow and few in 



"266 HARDER'S AMERICAN COOKERY. 

number. It cooks well and has white and exceedingly mealy 
flesh. 



CARTER. 

No. 1151. A medium sized, round, flattened white Potato, and 
one of the finest varieties, with numerous deeply sunk eyes. The 
flesh is white, remarkably dry, farinaceous and well-flavored. 

BUCKEYE. 

No. 1152. A handsome round Potato, with a little bright pink at 
the bottom of the eyes. It is grown to a considerable extent in the 
Western States. It cooks dry and light, and is well flavored when 
grown for early use. When grown for a late crop, in rich ground, 
many of the tubers are liable to be hollow in consequence of their 
rapid growth, thus impairing their value for table use. 

CALIFORNIA RED. 

No. 1153. A bright red Potato, having tubers that vary in form 
from long to nearly round. One of the most productive of all the 
varieties, but its liability to disease accounts for it not being gen- 
erally cultivated. 

BOILED POTATOES. 

No. 1154. Wash the Potatoes in cold water and remove all the 
small particles attached to them. Then put them into a saucepan 
with water to cover, add a little salt, put on the cover and set them 
on a brisk fire to bring them to a boil. Then set them on the side 
of the fire to let them boil moderately. As soon as they are done 
drain off the water, replace the cover tightly and set the Potatoes 
on the stove again for five minutes to dry them. If the Potatoes 
are good the flesh will be dry, white and mealy. Serve them in a 
napkin. 

NOTE. Do not let Potatoes boil too quick, nor let them remain in the water after they have been 
boiled. 

BOILED PEELED POTATOES. 

No. 1155. Peel the Potatoes and wash them in cold water (have 
them as near alike in size as possible). Put them into a saucepan, 
three-quarters full of cold water, add a little salt, put on the cover 
and boil them as in No. 1154. When done drain off the water and 
cover the Potatoes with a napkin. Then put on the cover, set them 
back on the stove, and when dried serve them in a napkin or with 
melted butter.

BOILED NEW POTATOES. 

No. 1156. : New Potatoes need not be peeled. Wash them in 
cold water, then rub them with a coarse towel and the skin will 
come off. Put them into a saucepan three-quarters full of cold 
water, add a little salt and boil them as in No. -1154. When done 
drain them and serve with melted butter or Cream sauce over them. 

BOILED POTATOES, GERMAN STYLE. 

No. 1157. Boil two dozen peeled Potatoes, and when they are 
done dish them up with the following preparation over them: Put 
into a frying pan two ounces of butter and one finely chopped onion. 
Fry the onion to a light brown color and add a little fresh bread 
crumbs. Toss this over a brisk fire, and when browned pour it 
over the Potatoes. 

STEAMED POTATOES. 

No. 1158. Steamed Potatoes are preferred by some to boiled 
Potatoes, and those that are not of the best quality will be found 
better when steamed than boiled. Have a small boiler three-quarters 
full of water. When the water boils set on top of this boiler an- 
other one with perforated holes in the bottom, and into this put the 
Potatoes, adding a little salt to them. Cover them tightly with a 
perforated cover. When the steam comes through freely the Pota- 
toes will be done. Serve them in the same way as boiled Potatoes. 
Where vegetables are cooked by steam power, perforated baskets 
are made to fit the boilers, and in this case the faucets must be left 
open so that no water can accumulate in the boiler. 

STEWED POTATOES, AMERICAN STYLE. 

No. 1159. Take one dozen boiled Potatoes and peel them (when 
of medium size cut them in halves, and when large cut them into 
quarters). Then slice them in pieces all alike a quarter of an inch 
thick, and put them into a saucepan with half a cup of hot milk and 
a small piece of butter, and season with salt, pepper and a pinch of 
nutmeg. Let them simmer until the milk is nearly reduced, then

it with a wooden spoon. Dilute this with half a pint of broth, and 
when it boils add one dozen sliced Potatoes and a faggot of parsley 
garnished with a sprig of thyme and one bay leaf. Season with 
salt and pepper and let it simmer slowly for twenty minutes, when 
the Potatoes must be cooked. Take out the faggot and serve. 

HASHED POTATOES, WITH CREAM, 

No. 1167. Hashed Potatoes are not chopped; they are boiled 
Potatoes, thinly sliced and then cut into small squares. Cut half 
a dozen boiled Potatoes as above and put them into a saucepan 
with a cup of cream. Set them on a brisk fire and when the moist- 
ure is half reduced, season with salt, pepper, a pinch of nutmeg (if

and season with salt. Then select three fine pickled herrings, 
wash, skin and bone them. Then cut them into scollops and soak 
them in milk. 

Slice two white onions finely, and put them into a saucepan with 
a piece of butter. Fry them slowly, not letting them get browned, 
and then add two soup-spoonfuls of flour. Let it cook a few min- 
utes while stirring it, and dilute it with cream or boiled milk, so as 
to have a thick sauce. Season with salt, pepper and nutmeg, add a 
few drops of meat glaze, and cook it slowly for twenty minutes. 
Then rub it through a fine sieve. 

Butter a deep baking dish, put a layer of the sliced Potatoes in it. 
Cover them with the sauce and add a layer of the scolloped herring. 
Alternate thus until the dish is full, and have the top layer of 
Potatoes. Cover them with the sauce, and over this sprinkle

THE PHYSIOLOGY OP TASTE. 279 

and season with salt, pepper and nutmeg. Mix them well together 
with a wooden spoon, and moisten them with a cup of milk. Then 
add the yolks of five raw eggs, mixing them well with the Potatoes, 
butter the border moulds with clarified butter, fill them carefully 
with the Potatoes, smooth the tops, and put them in the oven to 
bake for fifteen minutes. Then take them out of the oven and let 
them cool for fifteen minutes. Then pass the blade of a knife 
between the Potatoes and the mould, turn the borders on a dish 
and remove the mould carefully. Then brush the borders with the 
yolk of an egg, diluted with a few drops of water. Put them back 
in the oven for a few minutes to get brown, and fill the center with 
the preparation intended for the border, which will be described 
hereafter. 

NOTE. They may also be made by sprinkling the moulds with bread crumbs after they are 
buttered. When prepared in this manner, bake them for twenty minutes and they will be ready to 
serve. When making the Potato borders by hand prepare the Potatoes as above, then put them 
on a floured table and shape them in rolls long enough to border the dish. Have the border about 
two inches thick. Cut a carrot diagonally, dip it in flour and then make an impression in the border 
with it. or various different desigus can be impressed on the top. In this way the borders can be 
made more attractive than when made in mould. Brush the borders with the yolks of eggs diluted 
with a little water, wipe the edges clean and set them in the oven for a few minutes to get nicely 
colored. 

POTATO CRUSTS. 

No. 1208. Prepare the Potatoes as in No. 1185. Then put 
them into a buttered square tin pan (having them an inch and a half 
thick), smooth the top evenly and cover it with a buttered paper. 
Then set them aside to cool. When cold turn them out on the 
table, and with a round cutter (the size of a dollar) cut them out. 
Roll them in fresh bread crumbs, then dip them in beaten eggs and 
bread them again. Form them nicely, and with a cutter (the size 
of a twenty-five cent piece) make an impression on the tops to mark 
the cover. Fry them in hot lard, and when nicely colored drain 
them, and in a few minutes remove the cover and scoop out the 
center, being careful not to injure the shell. Then fill them with 
the desired garniture, after which they take their name. 

NOTE. Potatoes in this style are often called Timbals and Pates. 

POTATO SALAD.

wine. Cover the bowl and set it aside for one hour. Then season 
with salt, pepper, oil and vinegar, arrange it properly and garnish 
with water cress. 

POTATO SALAD, BENNETT STYLE. 

No. 1212. Cut the Potatoes as in No. 1211, and put them in a 
salad bowl with four or six finely sliced gherkins. Rub the yolks of 
two hard boiled eggs through a fine sieve, put them in a bowl and 
add a tea-spoonful of mustard flour and one of anchovie paste, some 
salt, pepper and finely chopped chervil. Dilute this with oil 
and vinegar, mix them well and then add the Potatoes. Arrange 
them nicely in a salad bowl and garnish with hard boiled eggs cut 
in halves, and some sliced truffles that have been cooked in Madeira 
wine. 

POTATO SALAD, WITH ASPIC JELLY, CHARTREUSE. 

No. 1213. Boil two dozen firm, solid Potatoes; those that are 
mealy will not do for this recipe. They must be thoroughly cooked 
and then cooled. Then trim them into pieces about one or one-half 
of an inch thick, and after this cut them with a round column cut- 
ter, obtaining as many perfect pieces as possible. Put them on a 
napkin. Have some broken ice in a pan and put the mould in it 
that you intend filling. Line the mould with a coating of Aspic 
jelly and decorate the bottom with the whites of hard boiled eggs 
and some capers and olives in the shape of a rosette. Then dip the 
small round pieces of Potato in Aspic jelly and arrange them nicely 
around the inside of the mould close together, to form a solid wall. 
(They may be alternated with sliced beets or gherkins.) When 
this is done, line the inside again with Aspic jelly to fill up the in- 
terstices. 

Now cut some hard boiled eggs in fine slices, place them in the 
bottom of the mould over the rosette, and put over this a few thin 
slices of beef tongue and some capers. Pour a little Aspic jelly 
over it to keep it firm. 

Cut some cold boiled Potatoes in thin square pieces and put them 
in a salad bowl. Add to it one-quarter of its quantity of boned sar- 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE. 281 

dines, cut in small pieces, and a few capers. Now make a Mayon- 
naise dressing with Aspic jelly (see Book on Sauces). Season it 
highly. Mix it with the Potatoes quickly, before the dressing be- 
comes hard, and put the mixture in the mould to fill it. Then 
smooth off the surface evenly and keep the mould in a cool place 
until ready to use it. When ready to serve it, dip the mould in 
lukewarm water, dry it with a napkin, turn it over on a dish and 
remove the mould carefully. 

NOTE. This can be garnished with a variety of vegetables, and its success depends altogether 
iipon the care taken in preparing it. It may be filled with mixed vegetables, but they must be dried 
thoroughly before using. Care must be taken in making the Aspic Mayonnaise, which should be 
seasoned well. Only fresh and tender vegetables should be used. 



French PUMPKIN. German 

Potiron gourge ou Citrouille. Kurbis. 

No. 1214. The Pumpkin is now rarely used as a vegetable, having 
been superseded by the squash, which being finer grained and more 
highly flavored, is more acceptable. The Pumpkin, however, 
retains its popularity when prepared for use in pies. Some varieties 
grow to an immense size, and when dry are cut into the shape of 
buckets, baskets, and a variety of ornamental things. 

CULTUKE. 

No. 1215. Pumpkins are generally raised on cultivated ground, 
between hills of corn or potatoes, but they may be raised profitably 
in fields by themselves.

productive, grows to a large size, and somewhat resembles the 
winter crooked-neck squash. It is of a light cream color, sometimes 
streaked with green, and the flesh is of a salmon color. 

SWEET SUGAR PUMPKIN. 

No. 1218. This is a good cooking variety, being unsurpassed for 
use in pies. It grows to an immense size, often weighing over a 
hundred pounds. It is oblong in shape, having a mottled light 
green and yellow skin, with thick, sweet, tender, yellow flesh, and 
large seeds.

French PLJRSLAIN Germ.<ui 

Pourpier. Portulak. 

No. 1224. Purslain is a hardy annual plant, the cultivated 
varieties of which are an improvement over the common Purslain. 
The stem is tender and succulent, and is usually about one foot in 
length. The leaves are fleshy, broad and round, tapering at the 
ends. The plant may be cut for use when about five inches high, 
and is pickled, or may be boiled the same way as spinach. 

COMMON PUESLAIN. 

No. 1225. This kind grows abundantly in gardens and cultivated 
fields. The green and the golden Purslain are improved sub- 
varieties, and though considered more succulent than the common 
Purslain, they will hardly repay one for the trouble of cultivating 
them, the difference in quality being very slight. The common 
variety is the kind in general use. Sow it in shallow drills, at any 
time from April to July. It thrives well in any soil. 



ARTICLE CLXV. 



RADISH. 

Radis. Rettig. 

No. 1226. The Radish is cultivated for its roots, which should 
always be eaten in their raw state when quite young, as they are

apt to be pithy and tough when full grown. The young leaves are 
used as a small salad, and the green seed pods for pickling. The 
roots are served as a relish with salt, butter and bread. 

CULTURE. 

No. 1227. A warm, sandy loam, made rich and light by 
well rotted manure, with a liberal dressing of salt, will keep them 
free from worms. Sow the seed in twelve inch drills as early as the 
ground can be worked, once in two weeks for a succession of crops. 
Thin them to two inches apart as soon as the raw leaves appear. 
Radishes must have plenty of room and should be grown quickly 
or they will invariably be tough and wormy. 

SPRING AND SUMMER RADISHES. 

No. 1228. These varieties are all comparatively hardy, and may 
be sown in open ground, early in spring, when the soil is in good 
working condition. 

OBLONG RROWN. 

No. 1229. The oblong brown Eadish has a pear-shaped bulb, 
with an elongated top root, and does not grow particularly large. 
The flesh is white, hard and piquant in taste. 

OLIVE-SHAPED SCARLET. 

No. 1230. The bulb is an inch and a half deep, three-fourths of 
an inch in diameter, oblong and somewhat in the form of an olive. 
The skin is of a fine scarlet color, and the flesh is rose colored* 
tender and excellent. 

SCARLET TURNIP-ROOTED. 

No. 1231. The bulb is spherical and measures an inch in diam- 
eter in perfection. The skin is of a deep scarlet color, and the 
flesh is crisp and tender. 

LONG SCARLET. 

No. 1232. This variety is largely cultivated. The root is long, 
a considerable portion of it growing above the ground. The skin 
is of a pink color, and the flesh is white, crisp and of good flavor, 
though less pungent than the scarlet turnip-rooted. 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE. 285 

LONG WHITE. 

No. 1233. The root is long and slender, similar to the long 
scarlet. The skin is white, but becomes tinged with green when 
exposed to the light. The flesh is white, crisp and mild, and forms 
a nice contrast when served with the red varieties 

LONG WHITE, PURPLE TOP, 

No. 1234. This is a sub-variety of the long white; the portion of 
the root above ground being tinged with purple. 

SMALL YELLOW TUENIP-EOOTED. 

No. 1235. The root is similar to that of the scarlet turnip rooted. 
The skin is smooth and yellow, and the flesh is white, crisp, finely 
grained and rather pungent. 

WHITE CROOKED. 

No. 1236. The root is very long, being sometimes over twelve 
inches in length, and an inch in diameter, nearly cylindrical, often 
irregular, and sometimes assuming a spiral or cork-screw shape. 
The skin is white and smooth, and the flesh is white and pungent, 
but not as fine as many of the other varieties. 

YELLOW TURNIP-ROOTED. 

No. 1237. The bulb is nearly spherical, but tapers slightly 
towards the top root, which is slender. It grows large, but should 
be eaten when young and about an inch in diameter. The skin is 
of a yellowish-brown color, and the flesh is white, crisp and mild. 

LONG SALMON. 

No. 1238. This is similar to the scarlet variety and appears 
about the same time. 

LONG PURPLE. 

No. 1239. The root is long, considerable of it growing above the 
ground. The skin is deep purple in color, and the flesh is white, 
and of good flavor. If the seeds are sown in drills, the same as 
mustard, they will bring forth large green leaves, which can be used 
in small salads. 



286 HARDER' s AMERICAN COOKERY. 

EARLY BLACK.. 

No. 1240. The bulb is nearly spherical, but tapers slightly, being 
similar to the gray turnip-rooted. The skin is rough, wrinkled, 
and of a dull black color, and the flesh is white, solid and piquant 
in flavor. 

EARLY LONG PURPLE. 

No. 1241. This is a small and early sub-variety of the long 
purple. 

EARLY SCARLET TURNIP-ROOTED. 

No. 1242. The bulb is spherical, though flattened slightly, and 
often bursts longitudinally before attaining its full siza. The skin 
is of a deep scarlet color, and the flesh is rose colored, crisp, mild 
and pleasant.

scarlet-rooted, but smaller. The skin and flesh is white. 

GRAY OLIVE-SHAPED. 

No. 1244. This is similar to the scarlet olive-shaped. The skin 
is gray and the flesh is white, crisp and well flavored. 

GRAY TURNIP-ROOTED. 

No. 1245. This is generally round, though sometimes irregular 
in shape. It grows large and becomes hollow, and therefore should 
be eaten when young. The skin is mottled with greenish-brown, 
and is often marked with transverse white lines. The flesh is mild 
and of a greenish-white color, but not very solid. 

AUTUMN AND WINTER RADISHES. 

No. 1246. These varieties may be sown from the middle of July 
to the middle of August. The soil should be made light and pliable 
and should be watered well in dry weather. Radishes may be 
obtained in September and October direct from the garden. For 
winter use the roots should be harvested before the ground freezes, 
and should be packed in earth or sand, out of danger from frost. 
They should be immersed in cold water before being used. They 
are served as salad, the same as the spring or summer varieties. 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE. 287 

LARGE PURPLE WINTER. 

No. 1247. This is a sub-variety of the black Spanish, and 
resembles it in shape and character. The skin at first is black, but 
when washed assumes a beautiful purple color. 

BLACK SPANISH. 

No. 1248. The bulb is pear-shaped, having a long top root, 
which at first is slender and somewhat cylindrical in form, it swells, 
however, as it advances in age,, and finally attains a large size, 
being sometimes ten inches in length and four inches in diameter. 
It is one of the latest and hardiest varieties, being excellent for 
winter use. The skin is rough and nearly black, and the flesh is 
white, solid and pungent.

quality. 



288 HARDER'S AMERICAN COOKERY. 

RED RADISHES, FOR RELISHES. 

No. 1254. Radishes can be obtained in the Southern and Pacific 
States all the year round in the open air, and may also be obtained 
all the year in the Northern States when grown in hot-houses. 
Use only those that are solid, cut off the green top leaves, leaving 
only the small ones attached. Then scrape or slice the Radishes 
and put them in relish dishes on finely cracked ice or in cold water. 

BLACK RADISHES FOR RELISHES. 

No. 1255. Peel them and slice them finely. Sprinkle salt over 
them one hour before serving, then press out the moisture and 
serve them in small relish dishes. 

RADISHES FOR GARNITURE 

No. 1256. Radishes are largely used for garnishing salads, 
being cut into shapes resembling flowers. The black Radishes are 
used in green salads. 

THE OIL RADISH. 

No. 1257. This is a variety of the common Radish, principally 
cultivated for its seeds, which yield an oil. It is superior to the 
rape seed oil and is more difficult to extract. It is cultivated 
extensively in China and the Southern States. The plant produces 
more seed pods than the common Radish. 



ARTICLE CLXVI. 



French RAMPION. German 

Raiponce. Die Rapunzd- 

No. 1258. The Rampion is a biennial plant, the wild variety be- 
ing known as the Primrose. The leaves are long, narrow and 
pointed. The roots are white, of fusi-form, and fleshy, somewhat 
resembling the turnip. Both the leaves and roots have a pleasant, 
nut-like flavor, and are generally eaten raw as a salad, when young. 

CULTURE. 

No. 1259. The best roots are obtained from a rich, loamy soil, 
that is not exposed to the direct rays of the sun. Sow the seeds in 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE. 289 

/ 

April, in shallow drills that are ten inches apart, and when they are 
well up thin them to four inches apart in the rows. When the 
plant runs to seed the roots become fibrous, strongly flavored, and 
unfit for use. 



ARTICLE CLXVII. 



RAMPION, OR GERMAN OR EVENING PRIMROSE. 

French German 

Primevere. Schlusselblume. 

No. 1260. This is a hardy biennial plant that grows abundantly 
on the roadsides in this country. The roots, which are the only 
parte used, are, when full grown, about ten inches long, of fusiform, 
and have strong fibres. The whitish, thick outer skin peels off 
readily, and should always be removed. It has a nutty flavor when 
eaten raw, and is inferior to the true Rampion, being slightly pun- 
gent in taste. They are used in salads when young, and are pre- 
pared in the same manner as the oyster plant, when full grown. 

EAMPION SALAD. 

No. 1261. When prepared as a salad it should be mixed with 
pickled beets and celery, and should be seasoned and finished the 
same as other salads. 



ARTICLK 



RAPE. 

Colza. Rubsamen, 

No. 1262. This plant is cultivated for its seed, from which Rape 
seed oil is obtained. The seed is also used as food for canary- 
birds, and the leaves for salad, when mixed with cress or lettuce. 

CULTURE. 

No. 1263. Sow the seeds broadcast or in drills, in May, the same 
as mustard seeds are sown. The soil should be rich and moist to 
obtain a rapid growth, and tender, succulent leaves. The plants, 
should be cut to the ground before the second leaves develop.

ANNUAL ROUGH-LEAVED SUMMER RAPE. 

No. 1264. The radical leaves are lyrate and of a vivid green 
color. 

, COMMON OR WINTER RAPE 

No. 1265. This variety is biennial and is better adapted to a 
Southern climate than to the North. The leaves are smooth, thick, 
fleshy, and resemble the annual summer variety in shape. 

GERMAN RAPE. 

No. 1266. This variety resembles the Winter Rape, and is sown 
in May, the same way as corn. 

SUMMER RAPE. 

No. 1267. A biennial variety with rough, radical leaves, that 
are fleshy and dark green in color. The best quality of oil is 
obtained from this variety.

French RED CABBAGE. German 

Choux Rouge. Rolhkohl or Blaukraut. 

No. 1268. The Red Cabbage is similar to the white variety in 
shape, but its color is red or bluish-red. It is preferred by some 
to the white cabbage. For its cultivation and preparation, see 
Cabbage, Article XXX. 



ARTICLE CLXX. 



RHUBARB. 

Rhubarbe. Rhabarber. 

No. 1269. Rhubarb is a perennial plant, and is cultivated almost 
exclusively for its leaf stalks. The root leaves are "large, round, 
heart-shaped, and deep green in color, being more or less blistered. 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE. 291 

The leaf stalks are large, furrowed, succulent, and of a pale green 
color, often stained or finely spotted with red, and varying from 
two to three inches in diameter at the broadest part, and from one 
to three feet in length. The stalks are used for pies, tarts, jellies, 
and for various medicinal purposes. The juice makes a tolerably 
palatable wine. 

CULTURE. 

No. 1270. Rhubarb succeeds best in deep, and somewhat re- 
tentive soil; the richer its condition, and the deeper it is stirred, 
the better. Sow the seeds in drills, cover them with one inch of 
soil, and thin out the plants to six inches apart. Trench a piece of 
ground in the fall, manure it well, and transplant the young plants 
in the trench, three feet apart each way. Cover them with leaves 
during the first winter, and give them a dressing of coarse manure 
every fall. The stalks should not be plucked until the third year 
and the plant should never be allowed to run to seed. Seeds can 
never be relied upon to produce the same variety. The varieties 
are quite numerous, but those of good quality are limited in number. 

DOWNING'S COLOSSAL. 

No. 1271. This is one of the best and largest varieties, having a 
fine, rich, aromatic flavor. Stalks of medium size are the best for 
family use. They turn red when cooking. TVhen stewed it 
resembles currant jelly in color. 

ELFOBD. 

No. 1272. An early sort with slender stalks that are covered 
with a thin bright scarlet colored skin. The flesh is of a reddish 
color, which is retained when cooked, if the skin is not peeled off, a 
process which is unnecessary. 

HAWK'S CHAMPAGNE. 

No. 1273. A variety as eaily as the Prince Albert, of a deeper 
and finer color, but more productive and larger. 

WYATT'S LINNEOUS. 

No. 1274. A medium sized, very early and productive variety, 
that is highly flavored and but slightly aciduous. The skin is thin 
and the flesh tender. 



292 HAKDER'S AMERICAN COOKERY. 

WYATT'S VICTORIA. 

No. 1275. A productive variety, with large leaf-stalks, about 
three inches broad and over two feet long. They are reddish at 
the base and are often finely spotted with red to the nerves of the 
leaves. The skin is thick and the flesh is not very highly flavored. 

CAHOON. 

No. 1276. The stalks are short and thick, the skin being thick 
and green. The texture is coarse and the flavor harsh aud strong. 
It is seldom cultivated for culinary purposes, being used princi- 
pally in the manufacture of wine. The juice is pressed from the 
stalks, and to each gallon three and a half pounds of sugar is 
added. The wine is quite p'alatable, but lacks the fine aroma of 
grape wine. Any of the other varieties may be used for wine> 
sugar being added according to their sweetness. 

RHUBARB WINE. 

No. 1277. Cut half a pound of Rhubarb roots into small pieces, 
put them in an earthen jar, and moisten them with one quart of 
wine spirits (alcohol). Six days later add one gallon of dry white 
wine to it and cover the jar tightly. Ten days later filter it and put 
it into bottles. A wine-glassful taken every morning before break- 
fast is said to be very healthful. 

RHUBARB WATER. 

No. 1278. Out six ounces of Rhubarb roots into small pieces, put 
them in a quart bottle, fill the bottle with water, and set it aside for 
three days. The water diminishes phlegm, strengthens the stomach, 
and facilitates digestion. Take a wine-glassful at dinner time and 
mix it with wine. Re-fill the bottle when any is taken out and 
renew the quantity of Rhubarb roots every two weeks. 

STEWED RHUBARB. 

No. 1279. Stewed Rhubarb is used' as a relish and for pies and 
tarts. Peel and cut two pounds of Rhubarb into pieces about an 
inch long, parboil them for two minutes, then drain and put them 
into a saucepan, with four spoonfuls of cold water, and set it on a 
brisk fire, occasionally stirring it with a wooden spoon. When 
nearly cooked, sweeten it to taste, and let it cook until tender. 

NOTE. When cooked to be served as a relish, the pieces should be kept -whole, and in order to do 
this it is only necessary to be a little more careful in cooking them and not stir them too much. 
Rhubarb, after being cooked, must always be kept in an earthen bowl or jar and covered with paper. 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE. 293 



French RICK. German 

Riz. Reis 

No. 1280. Eice is a native of the Orient, where it is a staple 
food. The best and finest quality is now grown in South Carolina. 
After bread it is the most healthful nourishment known. It is pre- 
pared for food in many different ways as a vegetable, and is exten- 
sively used, when ground into a flour, by pastry cooks for puddings, 
creams, cakes, etc., which will be described in the Book on Pastry. 
In China an intoxicating wine is made from it. In selecting Bice 
care should be taken to see that the grains are whole, for when they 
are broken, or the Bice is of inferior quality, it cannot be prepared 
properly. "When it is properly cooked the grains should remain 
entire, and should not stick together. There is but one species. 
The plant is cultivated in warm climates in America, and grows best 
in low, moist soil, which can be overflowed. It is a light, nutritious 
food, and is easily digested. 

BOILED RICE, PLAIN. 

No. 1281. Wash one pound of Bice in cold water, and then put 
it in a saucepan with some lightly salted water. Stir it until it 
boils, so it will not become attached to the bottom of the pan. Then 
cover the saucepan and let it cook slowly for twenty minutes. After 
this set it on the side of the fire to allow the moisture to become 
dry. It may be served as a vegetable or a garniture, and in soups 
where Bice is required. 

BOILED EICE (ANOTHER WAY). 

No. 1282. Wash one pound of Bice in cold water, then drain it 
and put it into a saucepan. Pour over it twice as much cold water 
as there is Rice, season with salt and add a piece of butter. After 
it has boiled six minutes, cover the pan and let it cook slowly for 
twenty minutes. The Bice should then be cooked dry. When 
cooked in this manner it is used as a vegetable, and for garnitures 
or borders. 

STEAMED RICE. 

No. 1283. Bice is the same, either steamed or boiled, differing 
only in the mode of cooking. Wash and drain the Bice and put it 
in a saucepan or a can. Pour over it twice as much cold water as 



294 HARDEB'S AMERICAN COOKERY. 

there is Rice and season it with salt. Place the pan or can into the 
steam boiler, cover the boiler, turn on the steam and let it remain 
there about thirty minutes, when it should be sufficiently cooked. 
Have the pan or can perfectly clean or the Bice will have a rusty 
color when cooked. 

RICE BOILED WITH BROTH. 

No. 1284. Wash one pound of Bice in cold water, then drain it 
and put it into a saucepan with plenty of cold water. Set it on a 
brisk fire to boil for two minutes (occasionally stirring it). Then 
immerse it in cold water and drain it dry. Then put it into a 
saucepan and moisten it with broth enough to cover the Bice one 
and a half times its depth. Season with salt, cover the saucepan 
and set it on the fire. As soon as it boils set it on the side of the 
fire, let it boil slowly for twenty minutes, and then the Rice will be 
cooked dry. Then add six ounces of butter, divided into small 
pieces, and a pinch of nutmeg, and mix them gently with a wooden 
spoon. Bice cooked in this way is used for garnitures, borders, 
Tiinbals, soups, etc. 

RICE BORDERS. 

No. 1285. Cook the Rice as in Nos. 1282 and 1284. Then butter a 
border mould with clarified butter, press the Bice into it around the 
sides and bottom tightly, leaving a space in the center. Smooth it 
nicely on top, cover it with a buttered paper cover, and set the 
mould in a moderate oven for fifteen minutes. Then take it out, 
set it on the dish it is to be served on, and in five minutes lift off 
the mould carefully. Then fill the center of the border with the 
preparation intended for it. 

NOTE. When Kice is used for garnishing side dishes, it may be moulded in a Charlotte mould, 
or in a deep kitchen spoon. For the latter style dip the spoou in warm water, fill it with Rice, then 
gently press the Rice into an oval shape in the spoon. Then place the Rice on the dish that is to be 
garnished. 

RICE FOR PUREES OR BISQUE SOUPS. 

No. 1286. Bice is used in thickening Purees and Bisque or Cream 
soups, to which it imparts a delicacy for which these soups should 
always be distinguished. Wash the Bice in cold water, drain it, 
and put it into a saucepan. Pour over it four times as much chicken 
or veal broth as there is Bice, season with salt and add a piece of 
butter, one carrot and one onion, having four cloves stuck into it. 
Cover the saucepan and let the Bice cook until it is thoroughly 
done. Then take out the onion and carrot, put the Bice into a 
mortar and pound it into a fine paste. It may then be used as 
directed in the Book on Soups.

trim it and cut it into pieces about an inch long. Put into a sauce- 
pan, fry it lightly and then add a pint of white broth and the Bice. 
Season with salt and pepper and let it cook slowly, occasionally 
stirring it up. When the Rice is cooked, add three spoonfuls of 
reduced Tomato sauce. Mix the whole gently with a spoon, without 
mashing the Bice, and serve it with fried sausages around the dish. 

EICE WITH CURRY. 

No. 1288. Chop one onion finely, put it into a saucepan with a 
piece of butter, and fry it lightly. Then add two soup-spoonfuls of

pound of Bice (previously washed in cold water), a slice of raw 
ham, and a little Spanish saffron, tied up in a piece of cloth. Then 
moisten it with broth to cover, stir it occasionally until the broth is 
reduced, then moisten again, and let it cook until done. Then take 
it off of the fire, take out the ham and the saffron, and add four 
ounces of butter, and a handful of grated Parmesan cheese. Mix 
it gently, dish it up in a nice shape,- and pour over it a nut brown 
Butter sauce, or a reduced Madeira wine sauce, with some tomatoes 
and essence of mushrooms. 

RICE, SPANISH STYLE. 

No. 1292. Chop one white onion finely, put it into a saucepan 
with a piece of butter, and fry it lightly. Then add half a pound of 
washed Eice, and let it get thoroughly warmed while stirring it, 
after which moisten it with a pint of chicken broth. Cut a young 
and tender roasted chicken into small joints, and add it to the Rice, 
with a little Spanish saffron, and season with salt and pepper. 
Cover the saucepan and let it cook slowly for twenty-five minutes. 

RICE WITH CABBAGE, RISTORI STYLE. 

No. 1293. Grate four ounces of fresh fat pork and put it into a 
saucepan with a small head of cabbage, cut into fine shreds, and 
season with salt, pepper, and a few fennel seeds. Cover the sauce- 
pan, and set it on a slow fire. When the cabbage is cooked, add 
half a pound of Bice, which has been parboiled for five minutes and 
drained dry. Moisten with a pint of broth, cover the saucepan, and 
let it cook slowly until the Bice is done. Serve it in nice shape 
and sprinkle Parmesan cheese over it. 

RICE, PARISIAN STYLE. 

No. 1294. Wash one pound of Bice in cold water, and drain it. 
Then put it into a saucepan with three quarts of boiling water, and 
add a little salt and the juice of three lemons. Cover the saucepan 
and set it on the fire to boil. When the grains are soft (so they 
will not crack), drain it in a sie've, and put it into a medium sized 
saucepan with six ounces of warm clarified butter. Cover the Bice 
with a napkin moistened in hot water, and put the cover tightly on 
the saucepan. Set it in a moderate oven, and in twenty minutes 
the Bice will be cooked. In dishing it up use only a fork. 

RICE WITH CURCUMA, OR TUMERIC. 

No. 1295. Wash half a pound of Bice in cold water and then 
drain it. Put two quarts of broth in a saucepan, season with salt, 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE. 297 

and when it boils add the Eice. In ten minutes add four soup- 
spoonfuls of curcuma diluted in a cup of water, and let it boil 
briskly until the Rice is cooked. Then drain it on a sieve, return 
it to the saucepan, add a piece of butter, and keep it warm until 
wanted. 

NOTE. Eice in this style is used for garnishing deviled chops and curried meats. 
EICE, VALENCIENNE STYLE. 

No. 1296. Wash one pound of Rice in cold water, and drain it 
on a sieve. Chop one large white onion finely, put it in a saucepan 
with three spoonfuls of olive oil and fry it lightly. Then add the 
Rice and two ounces of ham cut in small pieces. Let it cook for 
four minutes, stirring it w r ell with a wooden spoon, and then pour 
over it three times as much chicken broth as there is Rice. Add a 
faggot of parsley garnished, one dozen sausages " chipolata," 
and season with salt and a pinch of red pepper. Set it on the fire 
to boil for ten minutes, then cover the saucepan tightly and set it 
on the side of the fire to cook slowly for twenty minutes, when the 
rice will be cooked. Take out the faggot and add six ounces of 
butter divided into small pieces, and a garniture of mushrooms and 
artichoke bottoms scolloped. Mix the whole gently together. 

NOTE. When Kiceis prepared in this style on Fast days, use fish broth; ornit the sausages and 
ham, and replace them with oysters, mussels and eels cut in small pieces. 

EICE, TURKISH STYLE. 

No. 1297. To prepare Rice in this style, it is necessary, first, to 
make a chicken or mutton broth, seasoned with salt, and garnished 
with a faggot of parsley, to which you have added some fine herbs, 
a few grains of pepper-corn and some cloves. When the broth is 
cooked strain it through a napkin. 

Put one pound of Rice in a saucepan and pour over it twice as 
much of the above broth as there is Rice. Set it on a brisk fire, 
and in fifteen minutes the moisture will be nearly absorbed. Then 
set it on the side of the fire, and when the Rice is dry add four 
ounces of clarified nut-brown butter. Cover the saucepan tightly 
and set it in a moderate oven for ten or fifteen minutes. In dishing 
up the Rice use a fork, and when properly cooked with the best 
quality of Rice, the grains will be found to be separate from each 
other. Serve a soup tureen of the broth with the Rice.

(six ounces of cheese if desired), and a pinch of nutmeg; mix the 
whole briskly with a wooden spoon, and press it tightly into the 
plain or fluted buttered moulds. Cover the moulds with a buttered 
paper cover, on top of which put a wooden cover that fits into the 
mould, and on this cover a weight to press the Rice down. When 
the Rice is perfectly cold, turn it out, and cut it into any vase-like 
shape. Then scoop out the center, and leave the shell about half 
an inch thick. Dilute the yolks of two raw eggs in a spoonful of 
water, and baste the Casserole inside and outside; then set it in a 
moderate oven until nicely colored. 

NOTE. Casseroles rnay be filled with any kind of meat garniture, fish or purees, and must always 
be nicely garnished over the top. They take their name from the garniture with which they are

having it somewhat firmer. Butter the Timbal or Charlotte moulds 



304 HARDER' s AMERICAN COOKERY. 

with clarified butter, and place them in a cool place to allow the butter 
to harden. (They may also be decorated with truffles, beef tongue 
or raspings of bread.) When the Bice is cool and the moulds are 
ready, line the moulds carefully with it, pressing it tightly together 
around the sides and bottom, but being careful not to disturb the 
decorations. Fill the centres with a garniture of meats or purees. 
(The Timbal is named after the garniture it is filled with. ) Then 
cover the Timbals with a layer of Rice, smooth it evenly, and cover 
it with a buttered paper cover. Then set them in the oven to keep 
warm until ready for use. When ready to serve them, pass a knife 
between the mould and the Timbal to loosen it, and then turn it on 
to the dish it is to be served on. 

NOTE. When making large Timbals, the Rice should be from one-half to three-quarters of an 
inch thick in the mould; for small garnitures, from one-quarter to one-half of an inch will be 
sufficient. 

PANADE OP RICE FLOUR FOR FORCED MEATS. 

No. 1321. Put one pint of white broth in a saucepan, and when 
it boils add one pint of Bice flour and a small piece of butter. 
Stir briskly with a wooden spoon while adding the flour, and con- 
tinue stirring for five minutes, being careful to have the paste clear 
and smooth so it will not stick to either the saucepan or spoon. 
Then take it off of the fire, put it in a plate or earthen bowl, cover 
it with a buttered paper cover to prevent it from crusting, and let it 
get cold until needed.- 

NOTE. This Panade is superior to the others for any kind of forced^raeats, but it must always be 
used fresh. For other Panades, see Book on Sauces and Preparations for Forced Meats. 

RICE CROQUETTES, CREOLE STYLE. 

No. 1322. Cook two pounds of Bice as in No. 1289, having it 
somewhat firmer and drier. When cooked, take it off of the fire, 
and add a small piece of butter, six . ounces of grated Parmesan 
cheese, and a small garniture of mushrooms, beef tongue, truffles, 
and the breast of a roasted partridge, quail or chicken, all cut into 
small square pieces. Mix the whole thoroughly, and put it in a but- 
tered square tin pan, having the Bice about an inch deep. Smooth 
the top evenly, cover it with a buttered paper cover, and set it aside 
to get cold. When cold, cut out some pieces with a round cutter (the 
size of half a dollar), and roll them in grated Parmesan cheese. Dip 
them in beaten eggs, then roll them in fresh bread crumbs, and form 
them nicely. Fry them in hot lard until nicely colored, then drain 
them, and serve them on a napkin, with fried parsley to garnish the 
base.

RICE FRITTERS (SUBRICS). 

No. 1323. Wash one pound of Rice in cold water, parboil it for 
two minutes, immerse it in cold water, and drain it in a sieve. 
Then put it in a saucepan, and pour twice as much boiling milk 
over it as there is Rice. Cover the saucepan and let it cook slowly 
until the Rice is cooked dry. Then take it off of the fire to get 
cool; after which add two ounces of butter, three ounces of grated 
Parmesan cheese, the yolks of six raw eggs, a pinch of salt and one 
of nutmeg. Mix the whole well together. Put some clarified 
butter in a frying-pan, and drop into it a tablespoonful of Rice in a 
lump. Repeat this until the bottom of the pan is well covered, not 
allowing the lumps to touch each other. Fry them on both sides 
over a brisk fire, and when nicely browned, drain them and then 
serve them hot.

add six ounces of powdered sugar and two ounces of butter and 
let it cook until thoroughly done. Should the Rice get too dry 
while cooking add a little more milk to it. Take it off of the fire, 
take out the lemon peelings and the stick of cinnamon, mix the 
Rice well together, and when it is somewhat cool, add to it the 
yolks of six raw eggs, a little essence of lemon or orange-flower 
water, (whichever may be desired). Mix it well together and put 
it into a buttered pan. Cover it with a buttered paper cover and 
let it get cold. Then roll the Rice in any croquette shapes desired, 
dip them in beaten eggs, then in fresh bread crumbs, arrange them 
in proper shape, fry them in hot lard, drain them, roll them in 
powdered sugar into which add a little ground cinnamon, and then 
dish them up on a napkin. 

NOTE. Either a Hard sauce or a Wine sauce flavored with Maraschino or rum can be served with 
this. 

RICE FRITTERS. 

No. 1325. Cook the Rice as in No. 1324. Then add some stoned 
raisins and currants that are perfectly clean, or some small square 
pieces of citron. Mix them all thoroughly, and, when the Rice is 
cold, roll it into balls about the size of a walnut. Dip them in 
frying batter, then fry them in hot lard, and drain them. After 
this, dip them in powdered sugar, and serve them on a napkin. 

. NOTE. The Fritters may be flavored with lemon or orange flower water, as they are considered 
the best flavors for Rice. The Fritters are always named after the ingredients that are put into them.

RICE CAKE, SOUFFLE. 

No. 1326. Prepare the Rice as in No. 1324, and when it is 
cooked, put it in a pan to get cold. Then flavor it with lemon or 
orange, add the yolks of six raw eggs, and mix the whole thoroughly. 
Then beat the whites of four eggs to a stiff froth, and mix it gently 
with the rice. Butter some Charlotte moulds, and dust them with 
bread crumbs; then fill them three-quarters full with the Rice, and 
set them in a moderate oven to bake. When baked, turn it on a 
dish and let it stand a few minutes; then remove the mould, sprinkle 
it with powdered sugar, and serve it with a bowl of lemon sauce 
separate. 

NOTE. Raisins, currants or any kind of crystallized fruit may be added. 
RICE CAKE, GLAZED. 

No. 1327. Prepare the Rice as in No. 1324, and, when it is cooked, 
put it in a pan to cool. Then add four whole raw eggs, the yolks 
of four more raw eggs, and six ounces of stoned raisins, currants, 
or citron cut in small pieces. Mix the whole thoroughly, and flavor 
with lemon or vanilla. Butter a square pan, in the bottom of which 
lay a buttered paper. Sprinkle it with flour, and put the Rice in the 
pan to the thickness of an inch. Set the pan into a larger pan con- 
taining some water, being careful not to let any of the water touch 
the Rice. Then set it in the oven to bake. When baked set the 
Rice out to cool. Then turn it out on a board or the bottom of 
another pan, remove the paper, and glaze the cake with a glaze 
made with rum or maraschino. Then set it in a moderate oven to 
dry, after which cut it in any shape desired, and serve with a Lemon 
or Rum sauce. 

RICE FOR COMPOTES OF FRUIT. 

No. 1328. Wash one pound of Rice in cold water, and drain it. 
Then put it in a saucepan with three quarts of boiled milk, stirring 
it until it boils. Then add the peelings of one lemon and a stick 
of cinnamon. Cover the saucepan and let it cook slowly. When 
the Rice is three-quarters cooked, sweeten it to taste, and, should it 
be too thick, add a little more milk. When it is done keep it warm 
for use. When the fruit is cooked as for Compotes, dish up the 
Rice, and garnish it with the fruit intended to be served with it. 

NOTE. For full description of Compotes, see the Book on Pastry. 

RICE WITH MILK, FOR INVALIDS. 

No. 1329. Wash half a pound of Rice in cold water, drain it 
dry and put it in a saucepan with six ounces of powdered sugar, 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE. 307 

two ounces of fresh butter, three soup-spoonfuls of white honey 
and half a teaspoonful of ground cinnamon. Then add three pints 
of fresh milk, cover the saucepan tight and set it in a hot oven to 
cook for forty-five minutes. 

NOTE. Care must be taken to have the saucepan high enough to prevent the milk from running 
over, as when the milk rises it should fall back to the Rice. This is light, agreeable, nourishing and 
healthful for persons having inflammation of the chest or stomach. 



RICE CRUSTS, OE STANDS FOE HOT OE COLD SIDE DISHES. 

No. 1330. Crusts upon which side dishes are dressed, are gen- 
erally cut from bread and are formed in various shapes, but those 
of Rice wili be found much better and more secure, as they are 
very firm and will not soften like the bread, especially when the 
dish to be served must remain on the table for some time. Besides 
this, the whiteness of the Rice, when the crust is well made, presents 
a much more pleasing effect than the bread. This will be found 
to be the case, especially in cold dishes, owing to the fact that the 
Rice can be cut or carved into any shape after it has been moulded, 
but it requires experience and practice to shape them nicely. 

HOW TO COOK RICE FOB CEUSTS OE STANDS. 

No. 1331. Wash four pounds of Rice in plenty of cold water and 
drain it. Then put it in a saucepan and pour over it three times 
as much water as there is Rice. Add a little salt and a small piece 
of butter and set it on the fire to boil, stirring it well. Six minutes 
after this, put the cover on the pan tightly, and set in a moderate 
oven for one hour, when the rice will be cooked dry. (If any of the 
Rice on top has become browned, remove it.) Then take the Rice 
from the saucepan with a spoon, being careful not to remove any 
that adheres to the side or bottom of the pan. Put it in a mortar, 
pound it to a fine paste and put it on a clean table board. Then 
dip your hands in cold water and work the Rice well together. 
Then butter a mould of the desired shape, fill it with the Bice, and 
smooth the surface evenly. Put a buttered paper cover on top, and 
on this place a wooden cover that will fit inside of the mould. A 
heavy weight must be put on the board to press the Rice down 
solid. Then set it aside for ten hours to get cold, and, when ready 
to use it, dip the mould in hot water and turn the Rice out on a dish. 
Then cut the Rice into any shape desired with a small sharp knife, 
and keep it covered with a damp napkin until wanted.

French RUE. . German 

Rue. Haute. 

No. 1342. This is a hardy, perennial plant, having a peculiar 
odor. The leaves are bitter and so acrid as to blister the skin. It 
is a stimulant and anti-spasmodic, but must be used with great 
caution, for unless this is done its use may result in serious injury. 
It must not be allowed to run to seed, and does best in poor soil. 
The plant is rarely used in this country for other than medicinal 
purposes. In the Eastern countries it is used in soups, and the 
leaves are boiled and pickled in vinegar. 

BROAD-LEAVED RUE. 

No. 1343. The stem is shrubby and the compound leaves are of 
a grayish-green color, having a strong odor. The flowers are yellow, 
in terminal, spreading clusters. The fruit is a roundish capsule, 
and contains four rough, black seeds. 

NARROW-LEAVED RUE. 

No. 1344. This variety is hardier than the broad-leaved. The 
flowers are produced in longer and looser clusters.

RUTA-BAGA RUSSIAN OR SWEEDISH TURNIP. 

Navet Rave. Stechriibe. 

No. 1345. The Ruta-baga, or Russian Turnip, is extensively 
grown for a farm crop. The roots are closely grained and very 
hard, and will endure a considerable degree of cold without injury. 
They are preserved best in a pit or cellar during the winter, and 
are excellent for the table early in spring. Sow them from the end 
of June to the middle of July, in drills two feet apart, and thin 
them out to eight inches in the rows.

French RYE. German 

Seigle. Korn-Roggen. 

No. 1350. Eye is a hardy (secale cereal) plant and is closely 
allied to wheat. The grain is ground into flour and constitutes a 
large portion of breadstuff. The Eye flour is the best for making 
a cake called conglofls, which is of Polish origin. The various 
recipes will be found in the Book on Pastry. 

CULTURE. 

No. 1351. Th time for sowing is from the middle of August to 
the first of September, and it succeeds best in sandy soil. One 
ploughing is given, "and the seed is sown broadcast. If cut before 
it is fully ripe, the grain makes better flour and produces a larger 
quantity. If intended for seed, the grain should be fully ripe.

French SAFFRON. German 

Safran. Saffran.. 

No. 1352. The common cultivated Saffron is a perennial plant. 
It is cultivated for its flowers, which are large, of a beautiful lilac 
color, and are used in dyeing, and to make the cosmetic called 
Rouge. The Saffron has been known for ages in Greece and Asia 
Minor. There are several different varieties. The French Saffron 
is much superior in color, and the Spanish is the best in flavor. 
The Saffron is cultivated in the United States as a garden flower 
only. The flowers are gathered after they show themselves, as their 
period of flowering is very short. The stigmas, or summits of the 
petals, with a portion of the style, are separated from the remain- 
der of the flower, and are carefully dried by aitificial heat, or in the 
sun. During this process they are made into the form of a cake, 
by pressure; but the finest Spanish Saffron is dried loosely. They 
are distinguished by the name of cake, or hay-Saffron. It must be 
kept in a dry place, in well-stopped vessels. Saffron has a peculiar 
aromatic odor, a warm, pungent, "bitter taste, and a rich, deep 
orange color. When soaked in water it colors the liquid an orange- 
yellow color. It is much used in the Spanish and Southern coun- 
tries for culinary purposes, for flavoring soups and rice dishes, and 
also by confectioners, and for medicinal purposes. From the seed 
a fixed oil is obtained somewhat similar to that of the sunflower. 
On account of the high price of the Spanish Saffron it is adulterated 
frequently. The flowers of other plants, such as safflower, marigold 
and arnica, are mixed with the genuine stigmas. They may be de- 
tected by their shape, which is rendered obvious by putting a 
portion of the so-called Saffron in hot water, which will cause them 
to expand. Much of this is to be found in the United States, and is 
sold under the name of African Saffron. Other adulterations are 
made with yellow-colored chalk, or sulphate of barrium, made into 
a thin paste, probably with honey, and attached to stigmas. The 
pure Saffron will always be clear when diluted with water, assuming 
a fine pure yellow tint, and the Saffron its red color. Less than the 
ordinary brightness of color in the Saffron should lead to the sus- 
picion of adulteration. Saffron should not be very, moist nor dry. 
The freshest is the best and should not be over a year old. When 
it is put in acidulated water it should color it bright yellow. 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE. 
YELLOW COLOEING FOR CULINARY PURPOSES. 

No. 1353. To a quarter of a pound of Saffron add a pint of water 
and one ounce of alum. Let it boil for fifteen minutes, then strain 
it through a towel and put it into bottles. When it is cold, cork 
the bottles tightly. 



French SAGE. German 

Sauge. Salbei. 

No. 1354. This is a hardy, perennial plant, possessing some 
medicinal properties. It is cultivated principally for use as a condi- 
ment, and is used more extensively than any other herb, both green 
and in a dried state, for seasoning stuffings, meats, stews and soups. 
It is also used for flavoring cheese, and, in the form of a decoction, 
is sometimes employed for medicinal purposes. It should be gath- 
ered for drying before the development of the flowering shoots; 
and when cultivated for its leaves, the shoots should be cut off as 
they make their appearance. The product will be largely increased, 
as the leaves are put forth in much greater numbers and attain 
larger size. 

CULTURE. 

No. 1355. Sow it early in^spring, in very rich ground. Cultivate 
it often and thin the plants to sixteen inches apart. The plants 
will survive the winter, and, if divided, will give a second crop 
superior to the first in quality. 

BROAD-LEAVED GREEN SAGE. 

No. 1356. The stem is shrubby, and the leaves are large, broad 
and heart-shaped, woolly, toothed on the margin, and produced on 
long foot-stalks. It is rarely employed for cooking purposes, but 
for medicinal purposes it is considered better than any other sort. 

COMMON OR RED-LEAVED.* 

No. 1357. This is the common Sage leaf of the garden, and, 
with the green-leaved which is but a sub-variety, is the most 
esteemed for culinary purposes. The young stalk, the leaf-stems, 
the ribs and the nerves of the leaves are purple. The young leaves 



314 HARDER'S AMERICAN COOKERY. 

are sometimes tinged with the same color, but generally change by 
age to clear green. The red-leaved is generally regarded as pos- 
sessing a higher flavor than the green-leaved, and is preferred for 
cultivation. 

GREEN-LEAVED. 

No. 1358. A variety of the red-leaved. The young shoots, the 
leaf-stalks, the ribs and the nerves of the leaves are green. 

NARROW-LEAVED GREEN SAGE. 

No. 1359. This variety is mildly flavored and is the most 
esteemed of all the sorts for use in a crude state. It is also one of 
the best for decoctions. 

DRIED SAGE. 

No. 1360. Sage, when used for culinary purposes, is best in its 
dry state, whole or ground; but like all other herbs, it should be 
used moderately.

French SAGO. German 

Sayou. Sago. 

No. 1361. Sago is a dry, granulated starch that is imported from 
the East Indies. It is the prepared pith of th'e Sago and other 
palms. Numerous trees in the East Indies and on the coast of the 
Indian Ocean, contain a farinaceous pith which is prepared for 
nutriment by the natives. The Sago Palm is one of the smallest, 
its height seldom exceeding thirty feet. The trunk is thick, erect 
and cylindrical, and is covered with a beautiful crown of foliage, of 
large, pinniate leaves, extending in all directions from the summit 
and curving gracefully downwards. The medullary matter contains 
most of the starch. When the large leaves have fallen off and the 
flowers commence to take their place, the tree is felled and the 
trunk is cut into billets about six feet long, which are then split to 
facilitate the extraction of the pith, which is obtained in the state 
of a coarse powder. This is mixed with water in a trough having 
-a strainer at the end. The water, loaded with farina, passes through 
the strainer and is received in convenient vessels, where it is 
allowed to stand until it has settled. It is then drained off and the 
farina is dried and formed into cakes by the natives. The Sago as 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE. 315 

sold here is prepared by forming the meal into a paste with water, 
and rubbing it into grains. This is produced in the greatest 
abundance in the Moluccas, but the finest quality comes from the 
Eastern coast of Sumatra, in Malacca and Singapore. It is refined 
so as to give the grains a fine pearly lustre. This is what is called 
Pearl Sago, which is the kind generally used. It is a small 
grain about the size of a pin-head. The common Sago is larger, and 
the grains are of a more unequal size and of a duller aspect, being 
mixed with more or less dirty looking powder. Sago is used as an 
article of diet, being nutritive and digestible, and wholly destitute 
of irritating properties. 

SAGO FOB INVALIDS. 

No. 1362. In its preparation care must be taken to boil it lon 
in water or broth. Drop it into boiling water or broth while 
stirring it, so the grains will dissolve thoroughly and not form in 
lumps. Should any portion not be dissolved it must be strained, 
as it might offend a delicate stomach. A table-spoonful of Sago 
to a pint of water is sufficient for ordinary purposes. It may be 
seasoned with sugar, nutmeg or other spices, and wine may be 
added if advisable. 

SAGO GEUEL. 

No. 1363. Boil one quart of water in a saucepan and then drop 
in three spoonfuls of Sago slowly, while stirring it with a wooden 
spoon. When it boils steadily, set it on the side of the fire to boil 
slowly and add a pinch of salt. In three-quarters of an hour add 
a wine-glassful of good white wine, the juice of one lemon, a soup- 
spoonful of powdered sugar and a pinch of nutmeg. Serve it hot 
or put it in an earthen bowl and serve it when cold. 

SAGO FOB SOUPS. 

No. 1364. Drop the amount of Sago necessary in boiling broth, 
or consomme, stirring it until it boils steadily. Sago is added to 
many purees and cream soups as a garniture. Sago or tapioca with 
chicken or veal broth, is partaken of in the morning by prima donnas 
to a considerable extent. 

SAGO SOUP WITH CBEAM. 

No. 1365. Wash the Sago in cold water, then drop it in a sauce- 
pan containing one quart of chicken broth, and let it boil slowly 
until well cooked. Then season it lightly and add half a pint of 
cream diluted with the yolks of two raw eggs, which will render it 
more nourishing.

SALSIFY, OR OYSTER PLANT. 

Salsifts. Haferwurzel. 

No. 1367. Salsify is a hardy biennial plant, and is principally 
cultivated for its roots, the flavor of which resembles that of oysters. 
The leaves are long and grass-like. The roots are long and tapering, 
like the parsnip, and when grown in good soil measure about ten 
inches in length and an inch in diameter. Their flavor is sweet and 
delicate, and they are said to contain medicinal properties which 
have a tendency to alleviate consumption. 

CULTURE. 

No. 1368. Salsify succeeds best in a light and well enriched soil, 
which should be worked to a depth of twelve inches. The manure 
should be well rotted, for when fresh and coarse the roots will grow 
irregular and ill-shaped. Sow early and quite deep, and give the 
same general culture as for parsnips. The roots are hardy and may 
remain out all winter, but should be dug early in the spring as they 
deteriorate rapidly after growth commences. For winter use store 
them in the sand. 

HOW TO PREPARE IT FOR COOKING. 

No. 1369. Scrape the skin off carefully and cut them in halves. 
Then slice them in sticks about two inches long, and throw them 
into a pan of acidulated cold water to keep them white.

purposes, but lacks the pleasant flavor of the true Samphire, though 
it is often sold as the genuine variety and used as a substitute. 

CULTURE. 

No. 1384. Either kind can be cultivated, but with the best of 
-care and attention it is impossible to secure a cultivated variety 
possessing the flavor of the wild kinds. It is best to put them in 
large pots in the garden, filled with earth and sand. They must be

French SAVORY. German 

Sarriette. Saturei. 

No. 1385. Savory is a perennial plant, with a rigid, angular, 
branching stem, about one foot and a half high. The leaves, when 
bruised, emit a strong, pleasant, mint-like odor. They are used 
for culinary and medicinal purposes. 

CULTURE. 

No. 1386. Summer Savory is always raised from seed that is 
.sown in April or May, in shallow drills fourteen inches apart. 
When they are three inches high, thin them out to six inches apart 
in the rows. It thrives best in light, mellow soil. 

Winter Savory is also raised from seed, or may be increased by a 
division of the roots. The seeds are sown in May in shallow drills 
fifteen inches apart. The roots may be divided in spring or autumn. 

SUMMER SAVORY. 

No. 1387. This is an annual species of Savory, and a native of 
the southern part of Europe. It is about one foot high, erect but 
slender, and produces its branches in pairs. The leaves, which are 
narrow and rigid, have a pleasant odor and a warm, aromatic taste. 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE. 321

are distinguished from the common head Cabbage by their 
peculiarly wrinkled or blistered leaves. They resemble the cauli- 
flower somewhat in texture and flavor, having but little of the 
musky odor and taste of the large varieties of Cabbage. They 
are hardier and more easily cultivated than the other varieties, but 
will seldom survive through the winter in open ground. A little

No. 1392. It is cultivated in the same way as carrots or turnips, 
being sown in April in the Southern States, or in July or August in 
the North, as the plants are liable to flower and run to seed, which 
impairs the value of the roots. Sow them fifteen inches apart in

No. 1395. Sow them in April, in rows sixteen inches apart, and 
one inch under the soil. Thin them out to twelve inches apart in 
the rows. The leaves should not be cut from the seedling plants 
during the first season. There are two varieties. The English Sea 
Beet is a dwarf variety, with ovate leaves about four inches in

French SEA-KALE. German 

Choux Marins ou Crambe Maritime. Seekohl, or Meerkohl. 

No. 1396. Sea-Kale is a favorite vegetable in the Southern States. 
The young shoots that appear in spring are the parts eaten, but 
they are not good until blanched. Their flavor is somewhat like 
that of asparagus. As the plant is perennial, the young shoots do 
not appear until the second spring, and are then blanched. The 
sprouts are cut for use when from three to six inches high and con- 
tinue in season about six weeks. They are prepared the same as 
asparagus. The roots are injured by excessive cutting, and some 
of the shoots should be allowed to make their natural growth, so 
that strength may be secured for the next spring crop. 

CULTUEE. 

No. 1397. The ground should be trenched one or two feet deep, 
according to the soil, and should be well enriched throughout. 
When the plants are to remain, sow the seeds in April. Keep the 
plants clear from weeds, nip otf the shoots of those that tend to. run 
to flower and, in autumn, when the leaves have decayed, add a lib- 
eral dressing of compost manure. Early in spring stir a rake over 
the bed, being careful not to injure the crowns of the roots, and 
cover them from eight to ten inches deep with the material intended

lightly salted water. When done, drain them on a napkin, and put 
them in a saucepan with a small piece of butter. Season with salt, 
pepper, nutmeg and a pinch of sugar; then toss them over a brisk 
fire for a few minutes, and moisten them with some white broth. 
When the moisture is reduced, add some Allemande or Cream sauce, 
rub it through a fine sieve, put it in a flat saucepan and add a glass, 
of cream to reduce the puree to its proper consistency. Add a 
piece of butter before serving.

SEMOULE. 

Semoule. Semoule. 

No. 1402. Semoule is a paste similar to vermicelli, but comes 

in small hard grains. It is made from the whitest part of wheat 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE. 325 

flour, and in America is largely sold under the name of farina (see 
Farina, Article LXXXVIII). The White Semoule is made from rice 
flour, and the yellow kind from wheat flour, to which a saffron dye 
is added, with some coriander and the yolks of eggs. The yellow 
Semoule is considered best and is much relished when boiled in milk 
and sweetened. Semoule is used for soups and a variety of culinary 
preparations, and is a good food for invalids. 

CONSOMME, WITH SEMOULE. 

No. 1403. Put four quarts of Consomme in a saucepan, and 
when it boils add in slowly half a pound of Semoule, stirring it 
well so it will not get lumpy. Let it boil slowly for twenty min- 
utes, season to taste, then skim it and serve. 

NOTE. A Consomme with farina, manioca, sago, tapioca, vermicelli, or any kind of paste may be 
made the same as the above and, by adding a little cream diluted with the yolks of eggs, it will be 
more nourishing. 

SMALL CKUSTS OF SEMOULE, PALEEMITAINE. 

No. 1404. Put three quarts of clear white broth in a saucepan, 
add a small piece of butter, season with salt and, when it boils, add 
in slowly two pounds of Semoule, stirring it gently, so it will not 
get lumpy. Then set it on the side of the fire to cook slowly until 
thoroughly cooked, keeping it firm. When done take it off of the 
fire and add two ounces of butter and six ounces of grated Parmesan 
cheese. Mix it well together and put it in a buttered square tin 
pan, having the mixture about one and a half inches deep. Smooth 
the surface evenly, cover it with a buttered paper cover and set it 
aside to get cold. Then turn it out on a table and, with a round 
cutter the size of a dollar, cut out as many pieces as possible. Boll 
them in fresh bread crumbs, dip them in beaten eggs, and then 
bread them again. Form them nicely in shape and, with a cutter 
ihe size of a twenty-five cent piece, make a slight impression on the 
top of each to mark the cover. Then fry them in hot lard and, 
when nicely browned, drain them and in a few minutes take off the 
cover and scoop out the center, being careful not to injure the crust. 
Keep them warm until ready for use. Then make a garniture of 
small boiled macaroni (spaghetti), cut in pieces a quarter of an inch 
long, mixed with the same quantity of small pieces of the breast of 
roasted quails or partridges, and an equal quantity of lean boiled 
ham and artichoke bottoms cut in small pieces. Put the garniture 
in a reduced Madeira wine sauce, add a few drops of lemon juice 
and mix it gently together. Then fill the crusts with the garniture 
and serve hot.

BALLS OF SEMOULE (QUENELLES,) VILLEROI. 

No. 1405. Put one quart of milk in a saucepan and, when it boils, 
add in slowly three-quarters of a pound of Semoule, stirring it 
gently, so it will not get lumpy. Then set it on the side of the fire 
to cook slowly until it is thoroughly cooked, keeping it firm. Take 
it off of the fire, let it cool a little, then add a handful of grated Par- 
mesan cheese and the yolks of ten raw eggs, mixing it well, and 
season with salt and a pinch of nutmeg. Then let it get cool. 

Now cut some truffles, mushrooms and the breast of a roasted 
fowl, in a short Julienne, and add them to a succulent and well re- 
duced Madeira wine or Allemande sauce, and set it aside to get 
cold. 

Prepare some small, oblong granulated Tartlet moulds and butter 
them with clarified butter. Put in each mould a thin layer of 
Semoule and smooth it neatly with a knife, leaving the centre hol- 
low. Then fill them with the above garniture, cover the top with 
Semoule, allowing it to form on top in a semi-oval shape, and 
smooth it off neatly. Set them aside to get cold and firm. Then 
take them out of the moulds and dip them in a cool Villeroi sauce, 
place them in a pan side by side, and set the pan on the ice so 
the sauce will adhere to them. Then trim them nicely, roll them 
in fresh bread crumbs, dip them in beaten eggs and bread them 
again. (Handle them very carefully.) Now fry them in hot 
lard and, when nicely colored, drain them and serve them on a 
napkin. 



ARTICLE CXCIV. 



French SHALLOT, OR ESCHALOT. German 

Echalote. Schalotte. 

No. 1406. The Shallot is a native of Palestine, and is used in 
the same manner as the onion, or garlic. The root of the plant is 
composed of several small bulbs united at the base, the whole being 
enclosed in a thin skin, varying in color in the different varieties. 
The ripening will be indicated by the decay of the leaves. After 
the bulbs are dried they should be stored in a light, dry situation. 
When exposed to frost or put in a damp cellar they rapidly decay. 
In flavor it is mild and pleasant, resembling the leek. They are 
prepared and cooked in the same manner as onions or garlic. 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE. 327 

CULTUEE. 

No. 1407. The Shallot will thrive in any soil that is adapted to 
the onion. The bulbous roots are readily increased by off sets, but 
seldom attain a large size. Plant them in April in drills one foot 
apart, and cover them lightly with soil. 

COMMON SMALL SHALLOT. 

No. 1408. This is an excellent early variety, and keeps well. 
The bulbs are about three-fourths of an inch in diameter and have 
a reddish yellow skin. 

JEESEY. 

No. 1409. A 'very early variety, quite tender, but decays early. 
The large bulbs are enclosed in a light-brown skin as fine in texture 
as the onion skin. 

LONG KEEPING. 

No. 1410. This variety resembles the common Shallot, but is 
considered superior to it on account of its keeping qualities, and as 
it is less subject to the attacks of the maggot. It will keep from 
twelve to eighteen months. 

ESSENCE OF SHALLOTS. 

No. 1411. Chop one dozen Shallots finely, put them in a sauce- 
pan with a piece of butter, and fry them lightly. Then add one 
pint of veal gravy and let it reduce to one-third of its quantity. 
Then season with salt and pepper and strain it through a towel.

French SHEPHERD'S PURSE. German 

Capselle. Tiischdkraut. 

No. 1412. This is a hardy annual plant that grows naturally in 
gardens. The root leaves spread out from a common centre, and 
in good soil attain a length of about eight inches. The stem leaves 
rest closely upon the stalk, being oval at the base. Under high 
cultivation the plants will attain a diameter of twenty inches. It 
is prepared in the same manner as spinach, or is served like en- 
dives, making an excellent salad. 



328 HARDER'S AMERICAN COOKERY. 

CULTURE. 

No. 1413. Sow them in May in shallow drills fourteen inches 
apart and thin the young shoots to four inches apart. Cover the 
beds with coarse stable litter late in Autumn, and remove it in the 
latter part of February. The plants will be ready for use in March 
or April. 



cxcvi. 



French SIEVA, OR SMALL LIMA BEAN. German 

Sieve (Petite Feve). Bohne, 

No. 1414. The Sieva is a variety of the Lima Bean, the plant 
attaining a height of ten feet. The pods are small and uniform in 
size, generally about three inches long and seven inches wide. 
When young they are green and wrinkled, but when ripe they turn 
to a pale yellowish-brown. They are a little earlier than the Lima 
Bean, but require the whole season for their complete maturity. 
The seeds are white, or of a dull yellowish-white, broad and flat- 
tened. They are similar to the Lima Beans, and are almost as 
delicate and richly flavored. The young pods are hard and tough, 
and are never eaten. This is the most productive of all varieties. 

MOTTLED SIEVA. 

No. 1415. A sub-variety of the Sieva, the only difference be- 
tween them being in the variegated character of the seeds, which 
are of a dull white color, spotted and streaked with purple. 



CXCVI I. 



SKIRRET. 

Eerie. Chervi. Zuckerwurzel. 

No. 1416. Skirret is a hardy perennial plant that is cultivated 
for its roots, which are produced in bunches at the crown or neck 
of the plant. They are oblong and fleshy, with a russet-brown skin, 
the flesh being white and sugary. When well grown they measure 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE. 329 

from six to eight inches in length and almost an inch in diameter. 
They are the whitest and sweetest of esculent roots and are very 
nourishing. They are prepared for the table in the same manner 
as the oyster plant. 



ARTICLK CXCVin. 



SNAKE OR SERPENT CUCUMBER. 

French German 

Concombre Serpentine. Schlangengurfce. 

No. 1417. This resembles the musk-melon in its manner of 
growth and in the color and taste of the ripe fruit, which is slender 
and flexuous. It is about three feet long and is often gracefully 
coiled in a serpent-like form. The skin is green, and its iiesh is 
white when young and yellow at maturity. It is grown principally 
on account of its peculiar shape for a garden vegetable, but is 
seldom used in cookery. The fruit may be pickled in the same 
manner as common cucumbers. 

CULTUKE. 

No. 1418. Sow the seeds in May in hills six feet apart, and cover 
them with half an inch of soil. Give them the same attention that 
cucumbers or melons require. 



CXCIX. 



SORREL. 

Oseille. Sauerampfer. 

No. 1419. Sorrel is a hardy perennial plant. The species as 
well as the varieties differ to a considerable extent in height and 
general habit, yet their usage is nearly the same. The finest roots 
are obtained from seedlings. These varieties are propagated by 
dividing the roots. This method must be adopted in the propaga- 
tion of the divicious kinds when the male plants are required. All 
of the varieties will send up a flower-stalk in summer, and it is 
necessary to cut the stalk when it first develgps in order to render 



330 HARDER'S AMERICAN COOKERY. 

the leaves larger and more tender. Sorrel is used for soups and 
purees, and is preserved for winter use. It is one of the most 
wholesome vegetables, and would be particularly beneficial to that 
class of the community that live much upon salt provisions. 

CULTURE. 

No. 1420. Sorrel is cultivated easily, and may be grown in almost 
any soil or situation, but thrives best in rich, moist soil. Sow it in 
April in drills fifteen inches apart, and cover it with half an inch 
of soil. Thin them out to ten inches apart. 

BELLEVILLE SORREL. 

No. 1421. The leaves are about ten inches long, by six inches 
in diameter, and are larger and less acid than the common garden 
Sorrel. The leaf stems are red at the base. 

BLISTERED-LEAP SORREL. 

No. 1422. This is similar to the common variety except that the 
foliage is blistered. It develops slowly and consequently remains 
longer in season. 

FERVENT' s LARGE SORREL. 

No. 1423. This is a hardy and excellent variety that produces 
abundantly. The leaves are large, of a yellowish-green color, and 
are put forth very early. 

SARSCELLE BLOND SORREL. 

No. 1424. This is a sub-variety of the Belleville, with larger and 
narrower leaves, and pale leaf-stems. It puts forth the leaves 
earlier than the common Sorrel and is of excellent quality. 

FRENCH, OR ROUND-LEAVED SORREL. 

No. 1425. The leaves vary in form, being roundish and heart- 
shaped, smooth, glaucous and entire on the borders. The leaves 
are more aciduous than any of the other varieties, and for this reason 
are preferred by many. 

SORREL WITH CREAM. 

No. 1426. Pick the stems off of the Sorrel, wash the leaves in 
plenty of cold water, then drain them, and chop them finely with a 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE. 331 

head of lettuce, the same quantity of young beet leaves, and a 
little chervil. Mis them well together; then put them in a sauce- 
pan with a small piece of butter, and stir them slowly until the 
butter is melted. Then season with salt and pepper and, when well 
cooked, add a pint of cream diluted with the yolks of five raw eggs. 
Serve hot. 

SOEEEL WITH GEAVY. 

No. 1427. Prepare and cook the Sorrel as in No. 1426, and, when 
cooked, drain off some of the moisture, and add a good gravy in- 
stead of the cream. 

SOEEEL PUEEE, FOE GAENITUEES. 

No. 1428. Prepare and wash the Sorrel as in No. 1426; then put 
it in a saucepan with a pint of water, and season it with salt and 
pepper. Set it on a brisk fire, and stir it with a wooden spoon 
until it is well cooked. Then drain it in a colander, and in twenty 
minutes rub it through a fine sieve. Then put four ounces of butter 
and two spoonfuls of flour in a saucepan, and let it cook for five 
minutes, stirring it well. Add the Sorrel, moisten it with a pint of 
broth and let it cook for ten minutes. Then add a cup of milk 
diluted with the yolks of three raw eggs, and stir the whole well 
until thoroughly mixed.

it is rubbed through the sieve, put it in a saucepan with four spoon- 
fuls of Allemande sauce. When it is reduced to its proper con- 
sistency, season it with salt, pepper and nutmeg. Before serving, 
add a piece of butter, mixing it all well. 

SOEEEL SOUP. 

, No. 1430. Wash and trim two pounds of Sorrel, two heads of 
lettuce and a little chervil, and then cut them in fine shreds. Put 
them in a saucepan with six ounces of butter, and stir the whole 
over the fire for twenty-five minutes with a wooden spoon until 
it is melted. Then add four spoonfuls of flour, and let it cook 
for ten minutes, stirring it well. (Dilute the flour so there will be 
no lumps.) Then add in slowly two quarts of boiling water, and as 
soon as it boils up, set it to one side to boil slowly, and season with 
salt and pepper. Twenty minutes later add one quart of broth. 



332 HARDER'S AMERICAN COOKERY. 

When it is ready to serve, prepare the following: Dilute a pint 
of cream with the yolks of four raw eggs; beat it up well, and 
strain it through a sieve. Add this to the soup with six ounces of

French rolls in fine slices, brown them nicely in the oven, and put 
them in a soup tureen. Then pour the soup over them and serve. 

SORREL SOUP FOR FAST DAYS. 

No. 1431. Prepare the soup as in No. 1430, but instead of broth 
add one quart of milk diluted with six raw eggs. 

SORREL SOUP WITH CREAM. 

No. 1432. Prepare the soup as in No. 1430, and, when the flour 
is cooked, moisten it with three quarts of chicken or veal broth, 
stirring it until it boils. Then set it on the side of the fire to boil

French SPANISH OYSTER PLANT. German 

Salsifts. Haferwurz* 

No. 1435. This is generally treated as an annual plant when cul- 
tivated. The roots are almost white, fleshy, long and tapering in 
their general form. When they are bruised, a thick, viscous fluid 
exudes, which is almost flavorless, and of a milky-white color. It 
is'cultivated exclusively for its roots, which are taken up in Sep- 
tember or October, and are served during the winter. They have a. 
pleasant, delicate flavor, and are healthful and nutritious. They 
are prepared the same as Salsify or Oyster Plant. See Article 
CLXXXII. 

CULTURE. 

No. 1436. Sow the seeds in April, in drills fourteen inches apart, 
and cover them with one inch of soil. Thin the young plants out 
to five inches apart, and during the summer treat the growing crops 
as you would parsnips or carrots.

SPEARMINT. 

Menthe Verte. Frauenmunze.. 

No. 1437. Spearmint is a hardy perennial plant, and is generally 
cultivated in gardens, but grows naturally about springs of water, 
and in rich, wet localities. It may be grown from seed, but is 
propagated best by a division of the roots, which are long and creep- 
ing, and readily establish themselves wherever they are planted. 
The roots may be set either in autumn or spring. Spearmint is 
used mixed in salads and boiled with green peas, and with the ad- 
dition of sugar and vinegar forms a much esteemed relish for roasted 
lamb. The common Mint is superior to Spearmint for every 
purpose.

Frcucli SPICES. Herman 

Epice. Wiirze. 

No. 1438. Spices are used to season, aromatize and enrich 
numerous culinary preparations. They are all vegetable substances 
with the exception of salt. Their importance cannot be overesti- 
mated as they are used constantly, yet often wrongfully. The art 
of spicing or seasoning properly is one that must be acquired, and 
experience is the best teacher. Many preparations would be indi- 
gestible and almost tasteless without the use of spices. Salt is 
probably used most, and after it comes the onions, shallots, 
chives, and garlic. The onion is used principally as an 
alimentary substance, while the others may be considered 
energetic stimulants to the appetite. High seasoning is more in 
vogue in the Southern States and in all warm climates, than in the 
North. The French, as a rule, use less strong spices in cooking 
than any other nation, preferring aromatic herbs instead, which 
answer the same purpose and are less exciting. India furnishes the 
major portion of strong spices, such as mulligatawny, chutney, 
curry, etc. 

SPICES FOR SALTED BEEF. 

No. 1439. Home-made spices are far superior to many of those 
bought from dealers, as the latter kinds are generally adulterated, 
and if not kept tightly corked lose their aromatic flavor by evap- 
oration. The following is the best recipe for making Spices for 
salted beef : Procure the following quantities of dried herbs: Two 
ounces each of thyme, sage, nutmeg, cloves, mace, and bay leaves; 
three ounces of white pepper, and one ounce each of marjoram and 
rosemary. Then pound each kind separately in a mortar and sift 
them through a fine sieve. Put the mixture in bottles and keep 
them tightly corked. When ready to use it add one ounce of the 
Spice to one pound of salt. 

SPICED SALT, FOR STUFFINGS. 

No. 1440. Procure the following quantities of dried herbs: One- 
half of an ounce each of powdered thyme, cloves, nutmeg, white or 
black pepper, and one-quarter of an ounce each of powdered bay 
leaves, marjoram, and red pepper. Mix them with one and a half 
pounds of fine salt, then put them in bottles and keep them tightly 
corked. Use it for stuffing. 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE. 335 

INFUSION OF SPICES FOE TURTLE SOUP. 

No. 1441. Put a few fresh marjoram leaves in a saucepan and 
add equal quantities of thyme, basil, savory and parsley, with two 
bay leaves, three chopped shallots, and some trimmings of fresh 
mushrooms. (Dried mushrooms can be used if desired.) Then 
boil one pint of good Maderia wine and pour it over the herbs, etc. 
Cover the saucepaa tightly, and in half an hour strain the infusion 
through a napkin and add it to a clear turtle soup. 

NOTE. Should the turtle soup be thick instead of clear, use powdered spices instead of leaves 
and add them to the stock. 

MIXED SPICES. 

No. 1442. The following mixture of Spices will always be found 
useful in the kitchen. Procure the following quantities of ground 
Spices: Eight ounces of thyme, one ounce of bay leaves, half an 
ounce of marjoram, half an ounce of rosemary, one and a half ounces 
of nutmeg, one and a half ounces of cloves, one ounce of white 
pepper, and half an oiince of red pepper. Mix them well together, 
put them in bottles and keep them tightly corked. These Spices 
may be used as they are, or may be mixed with salt. Three ounces 
of Spice is the proper quantity for three-quarters of a pound of salt. 

SPICED SAUCE. 

No. 1443. Put in a bowl a teaspoonful of ground cloves, one 
ounce of Anchovy paste, half a teaspoonful of cayenne pepper, and 
a wine-glassful each of walnut and tomato catchup (strained). Add 
to this one and a half quarts of white wine vinegar, and mix it well 
together. Then put it in an earthen jar, cover it, and set it in a 
saucepan containing water. Let it boil for two hours; then take out 
the jar, set it aside for a week, and then filter the sauce. Put it in 
bottles and cork them tightly. 



SPICES, HEKES AND FLAVOES. 

No. 1444. The following Spices, Herbs and Flavors should al-

French SPINACH OR SPINAGE. German 

Epinard. Spinat. 

No. 1445. Spinach is a hardy annual plant, and is said to be of 
Asiatic origin. The leaves and young stems are the only parts of 
the plant that are used, being extremely wholesome and palatable, 
and retaining their bright green color after being cooked. The 
leaves are smooth and oval-oblong shaped, though varying in the 
different varieties. Spinach is prepared in various ways and is 
eaten with almost every kind of meat. The expressed juice is used 
to impart a greenish color to certain dishes. It affords but little 
nourishment, but when eaten freely, is mildly laxative, diuretic and 
cooling. 

CULTURE. 

No. 1446. It should be planted in very rich ground. Sow it a 
foot apart, in drills, and commence thinning out the plants when 
the leaves are an inch wide. When they are two or three inches 
wide, they will be fit to gather. This is done by cutting them up 
with a knife entirely to the bottom, or by only cropping the large 
outer leaves. The root and heart should remain to shoot out again 
according to the season. 

FLANDERS SPINACH. 

No. 1447. This is a winter variety, and is considered superior to 
the Prickly Spinach which is in general cultivation during the 
winter season. The seeds are sown about the last of August, in 
drills one foot apart and nearly an inch deep. The Prickly-seeded 
Spinach is cultivated and used the same way as this variety. 

LETTUCE-LEAVED SPINACH. 

No. 1448. This is a fine productive variety, having short stems 
and large leaves that are rounded and of a deep green color tinged 
with blue. 

SORREL-LEAVED SPINACH. 

No. 1449. The leaves are pointed, of medium size, deep green, 
thick and fleshy. 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE, 337 

SUMMER ROUND-LEAVED SPINACH. 

No. 1450. This variety should be sown early in spring, but it 
soon runs to seed, particularly in warm, dry weather. The leaves 
are large, round, thick and fleshy. 

WINTER COMMON PRICKLY SPINACH. 

No. 1451. This is a hardy perennial plant that is prepared in the 
same way as the common Spinach. The leaves are arrow-shaped, 
smooth, deep green, undulated on the borders, and mealy on the 
under surface. 

HOW TO PREPARE SPINACH FOR BOILING. 

No. 1452. Remove the large stems, wash the leaves in plenty of 
cold water, and drain them in a colander. Then put them in a 
saucepan containing some lightly salted boiling water and, with a 
wooden spoon, keep the Spinach under the water, letting it boil 
over a brisk fire until cooked. Then immerse it in cold water, 
drain it, and press out all of the water. 

SPINACH, ENGLISH STYLE. 

No. 1453. Prepare and cook the Spinach as in No. 1452. Let it 
remain entire, or, if desired, chop it coarsely and put it in a sauce- 
pan with a piece of butter. Season with salt and pepper and, when 
it is thoroughly warmed, serve it plain, or garnish it with slices of 
boiled bacon. 

SPINACH, AMERICAN STYLE. 

No. 1454. Prepare and cook the Spinach as in No. 1452; then 
chop it finely and put it in a saucepan with a piece of butter. 
Season with salt, pepper and a pinch of nutmeg; stir it well with a 
wooden spoon, and when it is thoroughly warmed, add a few spoon- 
fuls of veal gravy. Then serve it, having the dish garnished with 
Jiard-boiled eggs cut in quarters, or small pieces of buttered toast 
cut in fancy shapes. 

SPINACH WITH GRAVY, FRENCH STYLE.

add two spoonfuls of light Espagnole sauce. Before serving 
garnish the dish with poached eggs, or small pieces of toasted bread. 

SPINACH FOR GARNITURES. 

No. 1459. Spinach prepared as in No. 1453, is used as a garni- 
ture for boiled bacon, pigs' jowl, or any large joints when Spinach 
is served with them . 

Spinach prepared as in Nos. 1455, 1456 and 1457, is served as a 
garniture for braised meats, entrees, or any kind of broiled or fried 
meat, especially veal and lamb. 

SPINACH FRITTERS (SUBRICS). 

Na. 1460. Chop one quart of boiled Spinach finely and put it 
in a flat saucepan with four spoonfuls of Cream or Allemande sauce. 
Reduce it on a brisk fire and then set it on the side of the fire. 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE. 339 

Season with salt, pepper and nutmeg, and add a small piece of 
butter and the yolks of eight raw eggs. Mix the whole well to- 
gether and set it aside to get cold. Then put some clarified butter 
in a frying pan, and drop the Spinach into it, one spoonful at a 
time, and manage it so that they will not touch each other. Fry 
them nicely on both sides ; then serve them on a napkin and garnish 
with fried parsley. 

GEEEN COLOR OF SPINACH. 

No. 1461. Pick, wash and drain five large handfuls of Spinach. 
Then put it in a mortar, pound it finely and add six glassfuls of 
cold water. After this, strain it through a towel, pressing it well 
to extract all of the moisture. Then put it in a saucepan on the 
fire, and just before it boils, set it on the side of the fire, keeping 
it at the boiling heat, but not allowing it to boil. Then drain 
it in a fine hair sieve. That which remains in the sieve is used for 
coloring. 

Another way of making the green color is as follows : Throw 
three handfuls of Spinach in some boiling water, with a little pars- 
ley and chives. Let it remain there- one minute; then immerse it 
in cold water, drain it, and press it dry. Then put it in a mortar, 
pound it finely, and rub it through a fine sieve. After this moisten 
it with a little cold white broth. 

CREAM OF SPINACH. 

No. 1462. Put four soup-spoonfuls of finely-chopped cooked 
Spinach and one dozen sweet almonds in a mortar, and pound them 
into a fine paste. Then add four macaroons made with bitter 
almonds, and sweeten with sugar to taste. Pound the whole well, 
and then add a quart of cream and the yolks of ten raw eggs. Mix 
them well together and strain the mixture through a sieve. Put it 
in a small mould and cook it the same as a custard.

are very palatable, while the winter sorts can be had in perfection 
in August. All of the varieties are tender annuals and thrive best 
in a warm temperature. 

CULTURE. 

No. 1464. Plant them in warm weather, and cultivate them 
generally as you would cucumbers or melons, being particular about 
the soil. The summer varieties should be planted six feet apart 
ach way, and the winter varieties at a distance of eight feet. Three 
plants are sufficient for one hill. Care should be taken not to 
injure or break the stems of those intended for winter use, as the 
slightest injury increases their liability to decay.

STRAWBERRY TOMATO, OR ALKEKENGI. 

French German 

To-male (/raise.} Lieberapfel Erdbeere. 

No. 1495. This is a hardy annual plant common to the Southern 
States. They are prolific and will thrive in almost any kind of soil. 
The fruit has a juicy pulp, and when first tasted has a pleasant, 
strawberry-like flavor with a certain degree of sweetness and 
acidity combined. The after taste, however, is much less agreea- 
ble, being similar to that of the common Tomato. The fruit is 
served raw with the addition of lemon juice, and is also preserved 
like plums and stewed and served like cranberries. Sow and 
cultivate them the same as the common Tomatoes. 



346 HAEDEB'S AMEEICAN COOKERY. 

PURPLE ALKEKENGI. 

No. 1496. The fruit is roundish and of a deep purple color, 
being more acidulous, less perfumed, and not as palatable. In its 
raw state it is a superior variety for preserving. 

SCARLET ALKEKENGI. 

No. 1497. The fruit is of a brilliant scarlet color at maturity. 
The plant is highly ornamental. The Fall and Common Yellow 
Alkekengi are similar to it, except in color. 



CCVII. 



French SWEET POTATOES. German 

Palate. B .taten. 

No. 1498. The Sweet Potato is a native of the East and West 
Indies, where it grows natural as a perennial plant, but when culti- 
vated it is always treated as an annual. They thrive well in the 
Southern States, but those grown in the North are much inferior, as 
the plants seldom blossom and the tubers never ripen perfectly. 
Though numerous varieties are cultivated, none can compare with 
those grown in the South. 

CULTURE. 

No. 1499. The Sweet Potato is cultivated much in the same 
manner as our common potato, and succeeds best in light warm soil, 
which should be deeply stirred and well enriched. The slips or 
sprouts are planted twelve inches apart in ridges that are four feet 
wide. Give the plants ordinary culture in the summer, and early 
in October the tubers will have attained their growth and will be 
ready for harvesting. The slips or sprouts are generally obtained 
by setting the tubers in a hot-bed in March and breaking off the 
sprouts from them when they are five inches high. For transplant- 
ing in a favorable season the plucking may be repeated about four 
times. In setting out the slips the lower part should be sunk one- 
half of their depth, and when dry weather occurs water should be 
applied moderately. Dryness and a warm and even temperature are 
essential for the preservation of Sweet Potatoes, for if these condi- 
tions are not supplied the tubers will decay rapidly. T'hey may be 
preserved until spring by packing them in dry sand and storing 
them in a warm dry room.

No. 1503. The skin is smooth and of a reddish-purple color, and 
the flesh is finely grained, sugary and of excellent quality. This 
variety is early and does not keep well. 

AMERICAN RED. 

No. 1504. The tubers are long, slender, and of a purplish-red 
color. The flesh is yellow, finely- grained, unctuous, sugary and 
farinaceous. It is hardy, and an abundant bearer, but does not 
keep well. 

ROSE-COLORED. 

No. 1505. This variety is hardy, productive, and keeps well.

No. 1507. Wash the Potatoes in cold water, and dry them. Then 
put them in the oven, turning them occasionally to have them 
cooked evenly, and, when done, serve them on a napkin. 

NOTE. In the Southern States they are served in cups that are similar to egg cups. Cut off the 
top end, scoop out a teaspoonful of the Potato, and put in its place a piece of fresh butter. 

BOILED SWEET POTATOES. 

No. 1508.- Sweet Potatoes are boiled or steamed in the same 
manner as common potatoes. When cold they are peeled, sliced 
and fried in butter. 

FRIED SWEET POTATOES. 

No. 1509. When raw, the Sweet Potatoes are fried in the same

Potatoes, mix them well together and, when cold, add half a pound 
of citron cut in small square pieces, half a pound of stoned raisins, 
one-quarter of a pound of currants, and half a pint of rum. While 
mixing them well together, add in slowly four raw eggs and the 
yolks of one dozen raw eggs, and sweeten it to taste. Now prepare 
some small pudding moulds, butter and flour them and fill them 
with the above preparation. Put the moulds in a pan containing 
an inch of water, and set in a moderate oven to bake. Serve them 
with Sabayon sauce. 

NOTE. A sqiiare pan with an inch border may be used instead of the moulds. Butter a paper on 
both sides, place it in the bottom of the pan and also butter the sides of the pan. Then flour it and 
put in the preparation, cooking it the same as above. When ready for use turn it out on a board, 
cut in pieces and serve with a Saboyan sauce. When the Cake is cold, it can be cut in pieces three 
inches long and half an inch thick, which should be dipped in beaten eggs, then rolled in bread 
crumbs and shaped nicely. Then fry them in hot lard and serve them as croquettes. 

CAKOLINA FRITTERS, NELLIE GRANT STYLE. 

No. 1514. Prepare the Potatoes as in No. 1513, and bake the

TANSY. 

Tanaisie. Wurmkraul. 

No. 15l8. Tansy is a hardy, herbaceous, perennial plant. The 
stem is about three feet high. The leaves are finely toothed and 
divided on the margin, and of a rich, deep green color. When it 
is cultivated for its leaves, the flowering shoots should be cut off as 
they make their appearance. The leaves have a strong aromatic 
odor and a bitter taste. It possesses the tonic and stomachic 
properties common to bitter herbs, but is seldom used for culinary

purposes. There are three varieties. The curled leaved Tansy 
differs from the common variety in its curled or frilled leaves. The 
large leaved variety is less fragrant, and the variegated-leaved 
variety has a peculiar color. Tansy is propagated by dividing the 
roots, as the variegated character of the foliage is not produced 
from seeds. 



CCX. 



French TAPIOCA, OR MANIOCA. German 

Tapioca, or Manioca. Tapioca. 

No. 1519. Tapioca is a coarsely granular substance obtained by 
heating, and thus partly changing the moistened starch obtained 
from the roots of the Janiplia manihot, a plant which is a native of 
Brazil. There are two chief varieties, and about thirty sub-varieties. 
The root of the sweet cassavas may be eaten with impunity; that of 
the bitter, which is the most extensively cultivated, abounds in an 
acrid, milky juice, which renders it highly poisonous if eaten in the 
recent state. The root is prepared for use by washing, scraping 
and grating or grinding it into a pulp, which, in the bitter variety, 
is submitted to pressure so as to separate the deleterious juice. 
It is now in the state of meal or powder, which is made into bread, 
cakes or puddings. As the poisonous principle is volatile, the por- 
tion which may have remained in the meal is entirely dissipated by 
the heat employed in cooking. Being nutritious, and at the same 
time easy of digestion, and destitute of irritating properties, Tapi- 
oca forms an excellent diet for the sick and convalescent. It is pre- 
pared for use by boiling it in water, and is used, like sago, in soups 
and puddings. A factitious Tapioca, known as Pearl Tapioca, is 
made from potato starch, and is sometimes sold as the genuine 
article. 

NOTE. The Tapioca obtained from grocers in the United States, is in the form of hard, white, 
irregular, rough grains. That which is sold under the name of Manioca, is smaller and finer, being 
preferred to the large Tapioca. 

TAPIOCA SOUP, WITH BEOTH OB CONSOMME. 

No. 1520. Put four quarts of consomme or broth in a saucepan, 
and when it boils, drop in it eight ounces of Tapioca or Manioca 
slowly while stirring it. Let it boil up once, and then set it on the 
side of the fire to boil slowly until cooked. Then skim it and serve.

No. 1521. Tarragon is a hardy perennial plant, originally from 
Siberia. It is cultivated for its young shoots and leaves, the latter 
being long-pointed, smooth and aromatic. Both are used as ingre- 
dients in salads, pickles, soups, etc. 

CULTURE. 

No. 1522. Tarragon is propagated annually by dividing the 
roots. Select a warm, dry situation in April, and set the shoots in 
rows, fifteen inches apart, and cover them with three inches of soil. 
It is sometimes improved by cutting, when they are set three inches 
apart in moist earth. When not allowed to run to flower, the 
plants will be more healthy, and of finer quality, and will yield 
more abundantly.

TEA. 

The, Thee. 

No. 1525. The Tea plant is a Dative of China and Japan, being 
cultivated extensively in both countries. In Japan it forms hedge- 
rows around the rice and cornfields; in China, whence immense 
quantities of Tea are exported, whole fields are devoted to its 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE. 353 

culture. It is propagated from seeds, and in three years the plant 
yields leaves for collection, and in six years attains a height of five 
or six feet. After the leaves are gathered they are dried by artifi- 
cial heat, and while hot are rolled in the palms of the hands, so as 
to be brought into the form in which they are found in commerce. 
The odor of the Tea leaves themselves is very slight, and it is 
customary to mix with them the flowers of certain aromatic plants, 
as those of the orange, jasmine, rose, etc., in order to render 
them pleasant to the smell. The flowers are afterwards separated 
by sifting. There'are two principal varieties the green and the 
black which differ considerably in flavor and strength. By chem- 
ical tests it has been ascertained that green Tea is colored by sul- 
phate of calcium and Prussian blue. Tea is astringent and gently 
excitant, and in its finer varieties exerts a decided influence over 
the nervous system, producing exhilaration and wakefulness. When 
taken moderately it is perfectly harmless, but in large quantities it 
produces nervousness, dyspepsia, and excites the brain and stom- 
ach. Green Tea is more injurious than black Tea, and should not 
be used by those who are dyspeptic. 

TO MAKE TEA. 

No. 1526. Tea is made in several different ways. 

The Chinese, who are supposed to know something about it, put 
a few Tea leaves in a cup, then pour boiling water over the leaves, 
and let them steep for a few minutes, having placed a saucer over 
the cup to keep the essence from evaporating. The liquid is then 
strained into another cup, previously warmed with hot water, and 
is ready for use. They use neither milk nor sugar, claiming that 
they injure the delicate aroma of the Tea, which is true. 

The general method of making Tea in America is as follows: 
Use an earthen tea-pot in preference to one of metal. Scald the 
pot well; then put in the quantity of Tea desired, set the pot on 
the stove, pour over the Tea sufficient boiling water to cover it, and 
let it stand ten minutes to draw. Keep the cover on the pot, and 
do not let the Tea boil. Then pour in as much boiling water .as 
is desired, and the Tea is ready for use. Do not pour water over 
Tea unless it is boiling hot, as unboiled water will not extract the 
flavor from the Tea leaves, and will sp6il the Tea. Never let Tea 
boil after it is made. Use the tea-pot only for making Tea. Use 
cold cream in Tea. 

TEA, RUSSIAN STYLE. 

No. 1527. An agreeable beverage is made as follows: Peel some 
fresh, juicy lemons, and slice them in thin pieces. Put one piece 
23 



354 HARDER'S AMERICAN COOKERY. 

in the bottom of each, cup, sprinkle it with white sugar, and then 
pour in the hot Tea. Sometimes the lemon peel is not removed, 
which imparts a slightly bitter taste to the Tea. 

ICED TEA. 

No. 1528. A delicious cold beverage for summer is made by 
making some mixed Tea (black and green), putting it in bottles, and 
setting them on the ice to cool. When ready to serve, pour the 
Tea in goblets, that contain some cracked ice, and sweeten it with 
sugar. A little champagne or rum may be added to each glass, if 
desired, but never add milk. 

AFTER-DINNER TEA. 

No. 1529. Tea may be served after dinner the same as coffee. 
Serve with some double cream or brandy or rum, whichever may 
be desired. Sandwiches or small cakes usually accompany it. 

TEA FOR INVALIDS. 

No. 1530. Put the yolk of one raw egg and a teaspoonful of sugar 
in a bowl and mix them well together. Dilute it with four soup- 
spoonfuls of cold milk, then add a cup of hot Tea slowly while stir- 
ring it briskly. Serve immediately. 

TEA CUSTARD, IN CUPS. 

No. 1531. Make a cupful of the best strong Tea and set it aside 
to cool. Then put the yolks of twelve raw eggs in a saucepan and 
add half a pound of powdered sugar. Mix them well together with 
a wooden spoon and then dilute it with the cold Tea. Add in slowly 
one quart of cooled boiled milk, stirring it gently. Then strain the 
mixture through a fine sieve and put it in custard cups. Set the 
cups in a flat saucepan containing hot water, which must reach up to 
the middle of the cups. Put the pan in a moderate oven, and as 
soon as the custard becomes firm take it out. Cover it if desired, 
while cooking. Do not let the water boil, or the custard will be full 
of little holes, instead of being solid throughout. 

NOTE. Coffee custard may be made in the same way by using a cupful of strong, black coffee, 
instead of Tea.

French THYME. German 

Thym. Thymian. 

No. 1532. There are two species of Thyme cultivated for culin- 
ary purposes: the Common Garden, and the Lemon or Evergreen 
Thyme, both of which are hardy perennial plants, having a shrubby 
character and a comparatively long growth. The leaves have an 
agreeable, aromatic taste, and are used for flavoring soups, stuffings 
and sauces. They should be used with moderation, as too much 
imparts a bitter taste to the substance. 

CULTURE. 

No. 1533. They are propagated from seeds, or by dividing the 
roots; but the finest plants are produced from seeds. Sow them in 
April, in shallow drills twelve inches apart. They should be thinned 
out to eight inches apart, and all weeds should be carefully removed. 
They maybe cut for use as soon as they have made sufficient growth; 
but for drying, the stalks are gathered as they come into flower. 

BROAD-LEAVED THYME. 

No. 1534. This is the favorite variety. The stem is shrubby, of a 
brownish color, and much branched. The leaves are small, green 
above and whitish beneath. 

NARROW-LEAVED THYME. 

No. 1535. The leaves are long, narrow and sharply pointed. 

LEMON THYME. 

No. 1536. This is a low green shrub, with a somewhat trailing 
stem. It is distinguished from the other varieties by the soft, 
pleasant, lemon-like odor of the young shoots and leaves.

TOMATO. 

Tomate. Liebesapfel. 

No. 1537. The Tomato is a half-hardy annual plant, originally 
from South America. It is very extensively used in the United 



356 HARDER' s AMERICAN COOKERY. 

States, being served on the table the entire year in different forms,, 
and is one of the most healthful and best of all garden vegetables. 
The plant, when full grown, is about eight feet high, with a branch- 
ing irregular recumbent stem and dense foliage. The fruit is red, 
white or yellow, and is exceedingly variable in size as well as form. 
The varieties are numerous, few of them appearing to be distinct or 
permanent. Much depends on the cultivation and the temperature 
of the soil. 

CULTURE. 

No. 1538. The Tomato is raised from seed and succeeds best in 
light warm and not over rich soil. Success depends on securing a 
rapid, vigorous, unchecked growth during the early part of the sea- 
son. Sow it in hot beds during March, or from six to eight weeks 
before they can be set out of doors. When the plants have four 
leaves transplant them into shallow boxes, setting them five inches 
apart. Give them plenty of air and endeavor to secure a vigorous 
but steady and healthful growth, so that, at the time of setting them 
in the open ground, they will be strong and stocky and about as 
broad as they are high. A slight check, while the plants are young, 
will materially diminish their productiveness. Set them out of 
doors as soon as danger from severe frost is over, but before doing 
so harden off the plants by gradually exposing them to the night 
air and by the withdrawal of water until the wood becomes hard 
and the leaves thick and of a dark green color. Transplant them 
carefully and cultivate well as long as the vines will permit. The 
fruit is improved in quality if the vines are tied to a trellis or to 
stakes. Sufficient plants for the garden of a small family may be 
started with little trouble by sowing a few seeds about the middle 
of March in a garden box or large flower pot and placing it in a 
sunny window of the kitchen. Transplant them in the open ground 
as soon as the weather will permit and the plant is strong enough. 

To have an extra large and beautiful Tomato, as soon as a cluster 
of flowers is visible top the stems down to the cluster, so that the 
flowers terminate the stem. The effect is that the sap is immedi- 
ately impelled into the two buds next below the cluster, which soon 
push strongly and produce another cluster of flowers each. When 
these are visible the branch on which they belong is also topped 
down to their level, and this is done five times successively. By 
this means the plants become stout dwarf bushes about eighteen 
inches high. In order to prevent their falling over, sticks or strings 
are stretched horizontally along the rows so as to keep the plants 
erect. In addition to this all laterals whatsoever are nipped off. 
In this way the ripe sap is directed into the fruit, which acquires a 
beauty, size and excellence that is unattainable by other means.

TOMATOES, YUM-YUM. 

No. 1593. Wash and clean six dozen green Tomatoes, slice them 
finely and add to them about the same quantity of finely sliced 
green peppers. Put them in an earthen jar with one pound of salt, 
mix the whole well together, and on the following day drain off the 
moisture and add one ounce of ground allspice, half an ounce of 
cloves, four ounces of grated horse-radish and six ounces of mustard 
seed. Mix the whole well together and pour over them some boiled 
wine vinegar to cover. Cover the jar tightly and keep it in a cool 
place. 

PEESERVED TOMATOES. 

No. 1594. Use only ripe Tomatoes, wa,sh them in cold water and 
trim off the stems. Pour boiling water over them, peel them, cut 
them in quarters and lay them in a wooden tub until all are finished. 
Then put them in a quart or gallon can, solder on the cover and 
boil it in a hot water bath. The quarts require forty-five minutes 
and the gallons an hour and a half to boil. 

PKESEEVED TOMATO SAUCE. 

No. 1595. Select nice red ripe Tomatoes, trim them, wash them 
in cold water, cut them in quarters and put them in a saucepan on 
a brisk fire. Let them boil for fifteen minutes. Spread a cloth over 
a basket or strainer and put the Tomatoes on this cloth to drain for 
one hour. Then rub them through a fine sieve and put the sauce 
in champagne bottles. Cork them tightly, tie the corks down and 
boil the bottles in a hot water bath for thirty minutes. All pre- 
serves should be put on to boil with cold water. When bottles are 
used they should be packed in straw, and when boiled let them 
stand until the water, in which they have been boiled, is cool before 
removing them. When ready for use this sauce may be prepared 
the same as fresh Tomatoes, and for this purpose it is only neces- 
sary to thicken the sauce, season it to taste and strain it again. 

WHOLE TOMATOES, PKESEEVED IN SAUCE. 

No. 1596. Select small, red, ripe, firm Tomatoes, dip them in boil- 
ing water and peel them. Put them into large-mouthed bottles, 
without injuring the Tomatoes, and do not have the bottles too full. 
Fill the bottles with sauce made as in No. 1595 to cover. Cork the 
bottles tightly and tie the corks down. Then boil them in a hot 
water bath for three-quarters of an hour. Before using these Toma- 
toes they should always be warmed in their own sauce.

TOMATO FIGS PRESERVED. 

No. 1597. The' Fig or Ked Pear Tomato, as described in No. 
1553, is one of the very best varieties for preserving. Dip them in 
boiling water and peel them, being careful not to injure them. 
Put five pounds of the Tomatoes in an earthen jar with five pounds 
of crushed cube sugar, then cover them and set them in a cool dry 
place for two or three days. Then drain the juice into a copper 
basin, set it on the fire to boil, skim it well and, when clear of all 
the scum, let the syrup cool and then pour it over the Tomatoes. 
Repeat this operation three times in one week. After this, when 
the weather is favorable, take the Tomatoes out of the jar and place 
them on dishes or plates in the sun to dry for about six or seven 
days, occasionally turning them over, and when they are dried put 
them in boxes lined with white paper. Sprinkle some powdered 
sugar over them, then put another layer of Tomatoes (not too close 
together), then powdered sugar again, then Tomatoes, and continue 
this until the box is full. Cover them and keep them in a dry 
place.

French TONKA BEAN. German 

Tonka (Feve). Tonkabohm. 

No. 1598. The Tonka Bean is the seed of a large tree that grows 
in Guiana, Mexico and the Southern part of America. The seed or 
bean is inclosed in an oblong, ovate pod, and is about one inch long 
and one-eighth of an inch wide. It has a dark brown, wrinkled, 
shining, thin and brittle skin, and a light brown oily kernel. It 
has a strong, agreeable aromatic odor and a bitterish taste. It is 
used for culinary purposes as a substitute for vanilla, which it resem- 
bles in flavor. Tobacconists use it largely to flavor tobacco and to 
mix with snuff when ground or powdered.

TRUFFLES. 

Truffles. Truffle, 

No. 1599. Truffles are a species of fungi that are subterranean 
in their habit and are mostly found in the neighborhood of oak and 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE. 369 

chestnut trees, but do not thrive well in thick woods. They are 
found from two inches to one foot below the soil. They have 
neither roots nor stems, and vary in color from white to light brown 
and black. They are somewhat globular in form and vary in size. 
Their surface is knotty or warty, and is covered with a skin or net- 
work which resembles veins. When they have attained their full 
growth they diffuse an agreeable odor which is quite peculiar. The 
flesh is solid and has a delicious taste, but when the Truffles are 
exposed for a few days they begin to decay and become bitter and 
disagreeable. They are put up in cans and bottles and can be ob- 
tained from all first-class grocers. But when canned they have lit- 
tle of the fine flavor and good qualities of the Truffle in its fresh 
state. They are used principally for stuffing turkeys, capons, 
and with goose-liver pates, etc. They have always been held 
in high esteem by epicures, and, owing to their rarity, have 
always commanded a high price. French Truffles can occa- 
sionally be obtained in New York from the stewards on Atlantic 
steamers, but the majority of those used in the United States are 
preserved, and the best brands can only be obtained from respon- 
sible importers. The district of Perigord in France furnishes the 
best flavored Truffles, which are of a black color. In the other 
parts of France they are grayish in color. The Italian Truffles from 
Piedmont are of a whitish color and have an excellent flavor. Truf- 
fles have not yet been found in the United States, although tubers 
that resemble them have been discovered in California, but it has 
not been accurately determined whether they are genuine Truffles 
or not. The following recipes are for canned Truffles.

the fire, and when this is reduced to one-quarter of its original 
quantity, add the Truffles and season with salt and pepper. When 
the Truffles are thoroughly warmed take out the faggot and dish 
them up. Pour the gravy over them and serve them with a dish of 
fresh butter.

TURNIP. 

JVavet. Rube. 

No. 1616. The Turnip is a hardy biennial plant, and has been 
cultivated from time immemorial. The roots of all the varieties 
attain their full size during the first year. It is most easily affected 
in its form and flavor by soil, climate, and mode of culture. There 
are a great many varieties. It is a wholesome and agreeable 
vegetable. 

CULTUKE. 

No. 1617. Sow in drills fourteen inches apart, and half an inch 
deep. Keep them perfectly free from weeds and, when the bottoms 
begin to enlarge brush away the earth from about the roots to the 
depth of half an inch or more, and give them a light dressing of 
wood ashes. It is the surest mode of obtaining fair and smooth 
turnips in old gardens, where they are almost certain to grow wormy 
if the earth is allowed to remain in contact with the roots. For the 
spring and summer crops it is important to get them started very 
early, so that they may have time to grow to a sufficient size before 
hot weather, when they will soon become tough and strong. 

For the fall crop sow in the Middle and Western States in the lat- 
ter part of July and August, as directed for the spring sowing.

one ounce of shelled almonds. Set it on the fire to boil slowly until 
the broth is reduced to half its original quantity. While the broth 
is being reduced prepare one dozen Turnips. Pare them, then wrap 
them in cooking paper and bake them. When they are done 
remove the papers and put the Turnips in the broth. Then reduce 
the broth to one quarter of its original quantity. Then strain the

French TURNIP-CABBAGE, OR KOHL-RABI. German 

Chou rave. Kohlrube. 

No. 1652. The Turnip-Cabbage, or Kohl-rabi, is a vegetable that 
is intermediate between the cabbage and the turnip, combining the 
flavor of both. The edible part is a turnip-shaped bulb that is 
formed by the swelling of the stem. For table use it should be cut 
when small, as it is then tender and delicate. When it attains its 
full size it becomes tough and stringy. 

CULTURE. 

No. 1653. It is cultivated best by sowing the seeds in rows, 
from May to July. It is difficult to transplant, hence it is best to 
sow the entire crop from seed, and thin it out as it stands. 

EARLY WHITE VIENNA. 

No. 1654. An early, small and handsome variety, with a white 
bulb. 

EARLY PURPLE VIENNA. 

No. 1655. This is similar to the White Vienna, except in color. 

STUFFED TURNIP CABBAGE. 

No. 1656. Peel and wash one dozen Turnip-Cabbages of equal 
size, parboil them until they are nearly cooked, and then immerse 
them in cold water and drain them. Cut the top parts off, and 
scoop out half of the centre of each, which you will chop finely. 
Add to it some raw forced meat of veal with fine herbs, season with 
salt, pepper, nutmeg and some finely-chopped chives, and mix 
them well together. Then stuff the scooped Cabbages with this 
preparation and arrange them in a buttered flat saucepan. Moisten 
them with a little veal gravy, then let them boil up once, after 
which set them on the side of the fire to cook slowly until tender, 
basting them occasionally with the gravy. When done dish them 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE. 381 

up. Strain the gravy into another saucepan, skim off the grease, 
and add two spoonfuls of Espagnole sauce. Reduce it to its proper 
consistency and pour it over the Turnip-Cabbages. 

TURNIP-CABBAGE, WITH CEEAM SAUCE. 

No. 1657. Peel one dozen Turnip-Cabbages, cut them in scallops 
and boil them in lightly salted water, in which a piece of butter 
has been put. When they are tender drain off the water, add four 
spoonfuls of Cream sauce and a piece of butter, and season with 
salt and pepper. Toss them well together in the pan, and then 
serve. 

TUENIP-CABBAGE, WITH BUTTEE SAUCE. 

No. 1658. Prepare them as in No. 1657, using Butter sauce in- 
stead of Cream sauce. 

TUENIP-CABBAGE, GERMAN STYLE. 

No. 1659. Peel and slice one dozen Turnip-Cabbages, parboil 
them for five minutes and then drain them. Slice two onions finely 
and put them in a saucepan with a piece of butter. Fry them 
lightly and then add the Cabbages. Season with salt, pepper, and 
nutmeg, and moisten them with a good broth. Cover the saucepan 
and let them cook until tender, when the broth will be nearly re- 
duced. Then add three spoonfuls of Butter or Allemande sauce, 
and a little veal gravy, allowing it to simmer for fifteen minutes. 
Before serving add a little finely-chopped parsley. 

TUENIP-CABBAGE, SMOTHEEED AND GLAZED. 

No. 1660. Peel one dozen Turnip-Cabbages of even size, parboil 
them until they are half cooked, then immerse them in cold water 
and drain them on a napkin. Then cut out the center of each with 
a round cutter, without breaking them. Arrange them in a deep 
flat saucepan lined with thin slices of fat pork. Then chop one 
handful of fresh mushrooms finely and put them in another sauce- 
pan with one chopped shallot and a piece of butter. Cover the 
saucepan and let them cook until the moisture is reduced. While 
doing this chop the portion of the Cabbage that you scooped out 
finely, and add it to the mushrooms when the moisture is reduced. 
Season them with salt, pepper and nutmeg, add four spoonfuls of 
reduced Allemande sauce and mix the whole together while adding 
the yolks of four raw eggs. Now put this preparation in an earthen 
bowl and when it is cold, add to it four spoonfuls of forced meat of 



382 HARDER'S AMERICAN COOKERY. 

chicken. Then fill the centres of the Cabbages with this mixture, 
moisten them lightly with veal broth, put the cover on the pan and 
set it in a moderate oven. When they are nicely glazed dish them 
up and serve with them a reduced Allemande sauce flavored with 
essence of mushrooms. 

TURNIP CABBAGE, FOR GARNITURES. 

No. 1661. For garnishing joints prepare it as in No. 1656, and 
alternate with stuffed tomatoes or mushrooms. For entrees of 
chops, etc., prepare them as in No. 1657 and 1658. Pour a light 
sauce over them and arrange the chops around them, on the dish, in 
a circle.

TURNIP-ROOTED CHERVIL. 

Cerfeuil (enracine). Knotig Gartenkerbd. 

No. 1662. This is a hardy biennial plant that is cultivated for 
its root, which is a valuable esculent. The roots are of fusiform, 
about four or five inches long, and nearly one and a half inches in 
diameter. The skin is grayish-black in color, and the flesh is white 
and farinaceous. It is boiled and prepared in the same manner as 
the oyster plant. 

CULTURE. 

No. 1663. Sow it in drills, in rich, mellow soil, either in April 
or October, and treat it as you would carrots. 



ARTICLE; ccxxil. 



UNICORN ROOT. 

Unicorn. Einhornwurzel. 

No. 1664. This is a hardy annual plant with peculiarly shaped 
seed-pods, which, when young and tender, are highly prized for 
pickling, and by many are considered superior to cucumbers. The 
pods are produced in large numbers and should be gathered when 
about half grown, as they are worthless when the flesh hardens. 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OP TASTE. 383 

CULTURE. 

No. 1665. Sow them in April or May, in open ground, about 
three feet apart in each direction, as the plants spread considerably 
when growing. They are cultivated easily. 



ARTICLE CCXXIII. 



French VALERIAN. German 

Valeriane. Baldrian. 

No. 1666. This is an annual plant, the roots of which are used 
for medicinal purposes. When in blossom the plant presents a 
beautiful appearance. The stem is smooth and branching, and the 
leaves are oblong, thick, fleshy and of a glossy-green color. The 
young leaves are used as a salad. 

CULTURE. 

No. 1667. It succeeds best in warm light soil. Sow the seeds 
during the latter part of April in drills that are fourteen inches 
apart. Continue sowing every fortnight until July for a succession 
of crops. 



VANILLA. 

Vanille. Vanille. 

No. 1668. This is a genus of orchidaceous plants that are natives 
of South America, the West Indies, and Mexico. It is a fleshy, 
dark green perennial, climbing plant, with a long, smooth, dark 
green stem, much branched, and finished at the nodes with serial 
roots, 'which cling to and obtain nourishment from the tree support- 
ing the plant. The dark green tough leaves are oval, sessile, fleshy 
and veinless. The pale, greenish-yellow flowers are about two inches 
in diameter. The fruit is a slender pod about eight inches long, 
filled with an oily mass containing numerous small, black, shining 
seeds. The pods are collected before they are quite ripe, dried in 
the shade, covered with a coating of fixed oil, and then tied in 



384 HARDER' s AMERICAN COOKERY.

bundles which are surrounded with sheet lead, or enclosed in small 
metallic boxes, and sent to market. Several varieties of Vanilla 
exist in commerce. The most valuable is the Manza Vanilla. It 
has a peculiar, strong, agreeable odor, and a warm aromatic, sweet- 
ish taste. The interior pulpy portion is the most aromatic. The 
Simarona Vanilla is smaller, of a lighter color, and less aromatic. 
The pods are dry, and contain no Vanilla. The Pompona or Babo 
Vanilla has pods that are from five to seven inches long, of a dark 
brown color, and possessing a strong odor something like anise. 
Vanilla is used in medicine, in perfumery, and for flavoring in 
cookery. 

VANILLA FLAVOR, 

No. 1669. Cut four Vanilla beans in pieces one inch long; then 
split them, and put them in a quart bottle. Pour over them some 
wine spirits or white whiskey, and cork the bottle tightly. Shake 
it well every day for a week, and then it will be ready for use. 
Keep the bottle tightly corked always. 

VANILLA BEANS. 

No. 1670. A Vanilla Bean may be boiled in the milk when 
making custards or creams. When it is boiled, remove the Bean, 
and put it back in the bottle, as it may be used several times. 
After repeated usage when almost all of the flavor has been extracted 
from the Bean, put it in a mortar with some powdered sugar and 
pound them to a fine powder. Then sift it through a fine sieve, put 
it in a bottle, keep it tightly corked, and use it for flavoring 
cakes, etc.

French VEGETABLES. German 

Legume (variee}. Gemuse. 

No. 1671. All kinds and varieties of plants that are cultivated 
for culinary purposes are classed as vegetables. Of some kinds 
merely the seeds or roots are eaten; of others, the leaves or the 
fruit alone is partaken of, while others are used only for seasoning. 

They are classified as follows : 

Alliaceous plants, such as garlic, leeks, onions and shallots. 

Asparaginous plants, such as asparagus, hops, cardoons and arti- 
chokes. 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE. 385 

Brassicaceous plants, such as cabbage, cauliflower, kale and 
Brussels sprouts. 

Cucurbitaceous plants, such as melons, cucumbers and squash . 

Esculent roots, such as carrots, potatoes, turnips, oyster plant 
and parsnips. 

Esculent fungi, such as mushrooms and truffles. 

Leguminous plants, such as beans, lentils and peas. 

Oleraceous plants, such as aromatic and pot herbs, as described 
in Article XIII. 

Salad plants, such as celery, endives, lettuce, cress, corn-salad 
and dandelion. 

Spinaceous plants, such as spinach, sorrel, sea-beet, nettle and 
orach. 

VEGETABLE BALLS, TUTKISH STYLE. 

No. 1672. Select a good head of cabbage, trim off the white, 
tender leaves, and parboil them for five minutes. Then immerse 
them in cold water, dry them on a napkin, and remove the hard 
ribs. Chop one pound of mutton fillet finely. Put it in a bowl, 
and add one finely-sliced onion, one handful of lightly-parboiled 
rice, a little finely-chopped parsley, three spoonfuls of reduced 
Allemande sauce, and season it highly. Mix the stuffing well 
together, and roll it into balls about the size of a walnut. 
Cover them carefully with the parts of the cabbage leaves, 
arrange them in a flat saucepan close together, in from four 
to six layers, seasoning each layer, and then moisten with 
broth to cover. Put a cover on them to keep them down 
in the pan. Then let them boil .until the broth is half re- 
duced. After this set them on the side of the fire to cook slowly. 
When they are cooked the broth should be almost entirely reduced. 
Put the balls on the dish they are to be served on, and make a 
sauce of the strained broth, diluted with the yolks of six raw eggs. 
Add the juice of one lemon to it, pour it over the balls and then 
serve them hot. 

TIMBAL OP VEGETABLE BALLS, MILANAISE STYLE. 

No. 1673. Prepare the cabbage leaves as in No. 1672. Chop 
one pound of mutton fillet finely, and put it in a bowl. Add half 
a pound of grated fresh fat pork, one handful of fresh bread crumbs, 
one finely-chopped onion, two spoonfuls of .finely-chopped fresh 
mushrooms, and a little finely-chopped parsley. Then season with 
salt and pepper, add two raw eggs, and mix the whole together. 
Roll this stuffing into small balls about the size of a walnut. Cover 
them carefully with the parts of the cabbage leaves, arrange them 
25 " 



386 HARDER'S AMERICAN COOKERY. 

in a flat saucepan close together, in from four to six layers, season- 
ing each layer, and then moisten them with broth to cover. Put a. 
cover on them to keep them down in the pan. Then put them on 
the fire and let them cook until the broth is reduced, and they will 
be thoroughly cooked. 

Prepare separately a Rice Rissoti, as in No. 1299, keeping it 
firmer, and add to it six ounces of butter and grated Parmesan 
cheese. 

Butter a Timbal mould, line it with the cabbage leaves, and put 
a layer of the rice around the sides and bottom about one-quarter 
of an inch thick. Now put in a layer of the balls and sprinkle them 
with some grated Parmesan cheese, and a little reduced Tomato 
sauce. Continue doing this until the mould is full. Cover it with 
a layer of rice, with cabbage leaves over it, and place some thin 
slices of fat pork on top of the leaves. Set the mould in a moderate 
oven to bake for half an hour. Take out the mould, remove the 
pork, and turn the mould over on a saucepan cover to let the moist- 
ure drain off. Then put the mould on the dish it is to be served 
on, remove the mould and pour over the Timbal a reduced Madeira 
wine sauce, flavored with essence of mushrooms. 

VEGETABLE BORDERS. 

No. 1674. To make vegetable borders the larger vegetables must 
first be cut with a spoon or column cutter, in any desired shape. 
Those generally used are Carrots, Turnips, Artichoke bottoms, 
Green Peas, String Beans, Brussels Sprouts, Flageolet Beans, and 
the flower buds of Cauliflower. The Carrots, Turnips and Arti- 
chokes are first parboiled, then cooked in broth seasoned with salt 
and a pinch of sugar. The other vegetables are boiled in plain 
water lightly salted, then immersed in cold water, so they will re- 
tain their color. Then drain and dry them on a napkin. Care must 
be taken when cooking vegetables for borders not to have them 
underdone. 

Butter the mould lightly with clarified butter, and set it in a pan 
in which you have some broken ice. Dip the vegetables desired for 
the border in clarified butter, and place them against the mould in 
whatever design you like, alternating them in color. When the 
butter gets cold the vegetables will adhere to the side of the mould. 
When the border is finished cover it with a layer of forced meat of 
chicken, being careful not to disarrange the design, and to have the- 
layers of equal thickness. Then fill the mould with a vegetable 
garniture, to which add a reduced Allemande or Cream sauce. 
Cover it with a forced meat of chicken, and smooth it nicely. On 
this put a buttered paper cover, and poach it for twenty minutes. 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE 387 

When it is ready to serve place a napkin on a saucepan cover, and 
turn the mould on to this napkin. Let it set for a little while to 
drain off the moisture. Then turn the mould on to the dish the 
border is intended to be served on, and carefully remove the mould. 

NOTE. This border may be filled with potatoes, or any kind of vegetable puree. Other Borders 
can be prepared with a puree of vegetables, such as celery, green peas, spinach, and chestnuts, re- 
ducing the purees well. When they get a little cooled add the yolks of raw eggs, mix them well to- 
gether, and then fill the moulds with the puree. Then poach them and proceed as explained above. 

CHARTREUSE. 

No. 1675. Chartreuse is one of the finest and most elaborate of 
all vegetable entrees. Young vegetables should be obtained, if 
possible; aud they must be prepared with care, and in a tasteful 
manner. Those that are used to ornament the mould should con- 
sist only of such as will not lose their color in cooking, as their 
fresh and bright appearance is what gives the fine effect to the 
entree. 

Wash and scrape some nice young red carrots, and cut them in 
pieces two inches long. With a column cutter cut out as many red 
pieces as possible, having them one-quarter of an inch in diameter. 
Put them in a basin of cold water as you cut them. 

Now prepare an equal quantity of turnips in the same manner. 
When they are both ready, parboil them separately in lightly-salted 
water; then immerse them in cold water, and drain them. Put them 
in separate saucepans, cover each with sufficient white broth to 
cook them; add a pinch of sugar, and let them cook slowly until 
tender, when the broth will be reduced. Put napkins on two plates; 
place the carrots on one plate and the turnips on the other; cover 
each with a napkin, and set them aside to get cold. (Some of the 
carrots may be cut in squares or in diamond shape if desired.) 

While these are cooking, make a vegetable essence of the carrot 
trimmings, a few turnips, a head of celery cut in small pieces, a few 
parsley roots, and two onions, in each of which stick four cloves. 
Put them in a saucepan with three pints of white broth, and as 
soon as it commences to boil, skim it well, and then let it boil 
slowly until the vegetables are thoroughly cooked. Strain the 
broth through a napkin, and reduce it with four spoonfuls of Espag- 
nole sauce to its proper consistency. 

While these are cooking, prepare the following: Cut one head 
of cabbage in quarters; remove the stalk and hard ribs, and par- 
boil the cabbage for four minutes. Then drain it, and tie each 
piece together. Put the pieces in a saucepan lined with thin slices 
of fat pork, and in the centre put a piece of trimmed and parboiled 
bacon and two sausages, on top of which lay one dressed partridge 
or four larded quails. Season with salt, pepper and a little nut- 



388 HAEDEE'S AMERICAN COOKERY. 

meg, and add a faggot of parsley garnished. Cover it with thin 
slices of fat pork, and moisten it with sufficient broth to cover it. 
Now put on the cover, let it cook slowly until thoroughly cooked, 
and then drain it in a colander. 

While the above is cooking, butter a large Timbal mould, and 
decorate the sides and bottom with the pieces of turnips and car-- 
rots, placing them side by side, alternating the colors, and arrang- 
ing them in some nice design. Put the mould in a cool place to 
allow the butter to harden and keep the vegetables in their proper 
positions. When the 'mould is prepared, put the drained cabbage 
in a napkin, and press out all of the moisture; cut the bacon and 
sausage in slices, and carve the partridge or quails. Put a layer of 
the cabbage on the bottom and around the sides. Now put a layer 
of bacon on top of the cabbage, then a layer of sausage, and then 
a layer of partridge or quail, and continue doing this until the 
mould is full, having a layer of cabbage on the top. Put a buttered 
paper cover over it. Now place the mould in a saucepan in which 
there is sufficient water to come half way up to the top of the 
mould. (Be careful not to get any water in the mould.) Set it in 
a moderate oven to cook for three-quarters of an hour. 

Ten minutes' before serving, put a napkin on a saucepan-cover 
and place the -mould on it with the top down so that the moisture 
will drain off. When ready to serve place the mould on a dish and 
carefully remove the mould that surrounds the vegetables. Then 
pour over it the sauce with the essence of vegetables. 

NOTE. This Chartreuse can be prepared in various ways as will be explained under the proper 
headings. Squabs, breast of veal, wild ducks, larks, teal ducks, tenderloins of veal and fish can be 
used instead of partridges or quails. It is customary by many to put the birds in the moulds whole, 
but it is best to cut them up beforehand as they can then be served properly. The cabbage can be 
replaced by braised lettuce and the birds can be roasted, then cut in pieces and arranged accordingly. 
Chartreuse is sometimes ornamented with green peas, asparagus tops and string beans by inexper- 
ienced cooks. But this should not be done, as the steam will change the color of these vegetables 
and when they are removed from the mould thay will be unrecognizable and their beautiful effect 
will be spoilt. 

TIMBALS OF EGG PLANT, MACKAY STYLE. 

No. 1676. Peel half a dozen small Egg plants and cut them 
lengthwise in six pieces. Trim each piece so as to have them all 
alike, put them in a bowl and season them with salt. Then cover 
them and one hour later drain off the water and dry them on a 
napkin. Put a piece of butter in a flat saucepan, and when it is 
melted add the Egg plant, fry it lightly and then drain it on a 
napkin. When it is cold arrange it in a buttered Timbal mould so 
as to cover the sides and bottom of the mould. Have the following 
preparation ready to put with this : Peel two Egg plants, cut them 
in slices, flour them and fry them lightly in clarified butter on both 
sides; then drain them on a napkin. Cut two braised fillets of 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OP TASTE. . 389 

mutton in very small pieces, put them in a saucepan and add four 
spoonfuls of cooked fine herbs and two of fresh bread crumbs. 
Season with salt and pepper and add the yolks of two raw eggs. 
Mix the whole well together, then put a layer of this stuffing in the 
mould and then a layer of the fried Egg plant, continuing in this 
way until the mould is filled. Cover it with a buttered paper cover 
and bake it in a moderate oven for half an hour. When ready for 
use turn the mould on to the dish, remove it carefully and glaze the 
Timbal with a reduced Madeira wine sauce. Serve a brown Italian 
sauce separate. 

TIMBAL OF SAUERKRAUT, GERMAN STYLE. 

No. 1677. Cook one pound of sauerkraut with half a pound of 
parboiled lean salt pork and, when they are three-quarters done, 
drain them in a colander and allow them to get cold. 

Prepare a Timbal mould and line it with a pats' paste. Put a 
layer of sausage meat mixed with fine herbs, in the bottom; then 
put a layer of sauerkraut on that with a few thin slices of the above 
pork and some slices of fresh fillet of pork over it. Continue doing 
this until the mould is full. Over this put a layer of pate paste to 
close the top tightly and place a buttered paper cover over it. Set 
the mould in a moderate oven to bake slowly for one hour and a 
half. Then remove the paper cover, turn the Timbal over on a dish 
and remove the mould. Make a hole in the centre of the Timbal 
and put in a few spoonfuls of Madeira wine sauce. 

SMALL VEGETABLE PATES, FRENCH STYLE. 

No. 1678. Cut one onion in small pieces one quarter of an inch 
square, and put it in a saucepan with a piece of butter. Fry it 
lightly, and then add one carrot and one turnip cut in small square 
pieces, the white part of a stalk of celery, half of a parsnip, and a 
little cabbage cut in fine shreds. Fry this mixture lightly for a few 
minutes, not letting it get browned. Then season it with salt, pep- 
per, and a pinch of sugar, and moisten it with just enough broth to 
cook it. Let it cook until the moisture is reduced to a glaze, and 
then add a soup-spoonful of reduced Allemande or Cream sauce, 
and some finely-chopped parsley. Then set it aside to get cold. 

Now roll out some puff paste on the table as you would do when 
making pies, and with a three-inch round granulated cutter cut out 
some pieces. Wet the border of each, put some of the above stuff- 
ing in the center, and then place one of the round pieces of puff 
paste on top to cover each one. Press the edges close together, 
and put them on a buttered and floured pan. Now baste them with 



390 HARDER' s AMERICAN COOKERY. 

the yolks of eggs, diluted with water, and bake them in a hot 
oven. Serve them on a napkin. 

SMALL VEGETABLE PATES, AMERICAN STYLE. 

No. 1679. Cut equal quantities of onions, carrots, celery and 
cabbage, in small square pieces. Put them in a saucepan with a 
piece of butter, and fry them lightly. Then moisten them with 
enough broth to cook them, and let them cook until the broth is 
reduced to a glaze. Now season with salt, pepper, nutmeg and a 
pinch of sugar, and add some reduced Allemande or Cream sauce, 
and some cooked asparagus tops, or green peas, that have been 
cooked separately (or any kind of vegetable that is in season). 
Mix the whole well together, add a little finely-chopped parsley, and 
then set it aside to get cold. 

Make a pate paste, or use the trimmings of some puff paste. Koll 
out the paste, and with a three-inch oblong granulated cutter cut 
out some pieces. Wet the border of each and put some of the above 
stuffing in the center, and then place one of the oblong pieces of 
paste on top to covereach one. Press the edges close together and 
put them on a buttered and floured pan. Now baste them with the 
yolks of eggs diluted with water, and bake them in a hot oven. 
Serve them hot on a napkin. 

SMALL VEGETABLE CRUSTS, MACEDOINE STYLE. 

No. 1680. Butter and flour one dozen small Timbal moulds that 
are a little larger at the top than at the bottom. Now roll out a 
pate^paste, line the moulds with it, and fill them with flour. Cover 
them with a layer of paste, make a nice border around the top of 
each, and baste them with the yolk of an egg diluted with a few 
drops of water. Now bake them in an oven and, when they are 
cooked, cut out the covers without injuring the borders. Remove 
the flour, and baste the inside and outside of the crusts with the 
yolks of eggs. Then set them in a moderate oven to dry. Garnish 
the crusts with a Macedoine of Vegetables, such as peas, beans, 
asparagus-tops and carrots, each being cooked separately. The 
crusts can be filled with these vegetables, mixed or singly. Add to 
them, before filling, a reduced Allemande or Cream sauce. 

VEGETABLE BREAD. 

No. 1681. This is made with any kind of vegetable purees. 
When the puree is cooked, it should be made firmer than when 
used as a garniture. The yolks of raw eggs must be added when 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE. 391 

the puree is cold. Purees that are thin will require more eggs than 
those that are thick ; and a reduced Cream sauce may also be added 
to make them of the required consistency. 

Put the puree in small buttered moulds, poach them, and serve 
with either Cream, Allemande or Espagnole sauce. 

NOTE. After they are cooked and become cold, they may be cut into a variety of shapes, and used 
-as a garniture for soups. They may also be cut in slices one-quarter of an inch thick, then breaded, 
And fried, to be used as a garniture. 

MACEDOINE OF VEGETABLES, SPANISH STYLE. 

No. 1682. Put two finely sliced white onions in a saucepan with 
four spoonfuls of sweet oil and fry them lightly. Then add four 
sliced bell peppers and, after they have simmered for a few minutes, 
add six red tomatoes that have been peeled and cut in quarters, and 
one egg plant that has been peeled and cut in small slices. Lt 
them cook until the moisture is reduced and then add one handful 
of boiled string beans cut in small pieces. Season with salt, pep- 
per and a pinch of red pepper. Now dish them up in a vegetable 
border and garnish them with plain boiled okra. 

MACEDOINE OF VEGETABLES, MEXICAN STYLE. 

No. 1683. Prepare the following vegetables, viz.: Two dozen 
artichoke bottoms cut in quarters and an equal quantity each of 
green peas, shelled beans, string beans and asparagus tops, four 
bell -peppers cut in small pieces, and four heads of lettuce that have 
been trimmed and parboiled for two minutes. 

Put one large onion, chopped finely, in a saucepan with a piece 
of butter. Fry it lightly and then add six ounces of finely-chopped 
lean raw ham. Let it cook for ten minutes and then sprinkle over 
it two soup-spoonfuls of flour. Let it cook for a few minutes, 
then add three pints of broth. Stir it well until it boils and 
then add a faggot of parsley garnished with a sprig of thyme 
and one bay leaf. When it boils slowly add the above vege- 
tables, season with salt and pepper, cover the saucepan and 
let them cook until tender. Then remove the faggot and dish 
up the vegetables, being careful not to break or mash them. Reduce 
the sauce with some essence of truffles, pour it over the vegetables 
and garnish with small pieces of toasted bread. 

NOTE. This garniture makes a nice effect when dished up in a vegetable border.

No. 1685. Chop one onion finely, put it in a saucepan with a 
piece of butter, and fry it lightly. Now prepare two dozen young 
red carrots, cut them in halves, and prepare the same quantity of 
mixed beets, parsnips, celeriac, and turnips cut in halves and 
nicely trimmed. Parboil each kind separately for a few minutes, 
drain them and then put them in the saucepan with just enough 
broth to cook them. Season with salt and pepper, and let them 
cook slowly. When done, dish them up carefully. 

Prepare separately, one dozen small white glazed onions, and add 
them to the above. Now reduce the gravy, add to it a teaspoonful 
of mustard, and pour it over the vegetables. 

LARGE MACEDOINE GARNITURE. 

No. 1686. This garniture can be made of almost any kinds of 
vegetables that are young and tender. Five or six kinds should be 
used, having them of varied colors if possible. The kinds princi- 
pally used are carrots, artichoke-bottoms, turnips, green peas, 
string beans, lima beans, cucumbers, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, 
brocoli, small onions and mushrooms. The carrots and turnips are 
cut in any kind of fancy shapes, parboiled and then glazed. The 
cucumbers are scalloped and tossed in butter. The string beans are 
cut in diamond shape, about an inch long, and boiled in lightly 
salted water and then immersed in cold water, so they will retain 
their green color. Brussels sprouts and peas must be boiled and 
treated in the same manner. The flower buds only of cauliflowers 
and brocoli are used and must be kept in small bunches. The 
onions are parboiled and glazed. The mushrooms must be kept 
white and the tops cut in crescent shapes to give them a nice 
appearance. The artichoke-bottoms, when cooked, are cut in 
quarters. These vegetables are cooked separately. Then put them 
together in a flat saucepan, season with salt and pepper and add 
a little Cream sauce. Toss tbem gently over the fire. 

NOTE. This can be served as a vegetable if put in a vegetable border.

ESSENCE OF VEGETABLES. 

No. 1696. Put the following in a saucepan: One shin of beef, 
one of veal, one hen, six carrots, six onions and two turnips. Pour 
two gallons of cold water over them and, when it boils, skim it 
well. Then add two heads of celery, a faggot of parsley garnished 
with two heads of lettuce, two leeks, some whole peppers and a few 
cloves. Now let it cook slowly for four hours, then strain it through 
a towel and reduce it on the fire to half of its quantity. 

FEYING BATTEK FOR VEGETABLES. 

No. 1697. Put two pounds of sifted flour in an earthen bowl, 
make a hollow in the centre, and add four ounces of melted butter 
and water enough to make a light batter. Mix it well and see that 
no lumps form, having it nice and smooth, and add a little salt. 
This batter should be made one hour before it is used. When ready 
to use it, beat the whites of four eggs into a stiff froth, and add 
them to the batter, mixing the whole gently. 

VEGETABLE SALADS. 

No. 1698. All vegetables that can be eaten raw or cooked can be 
used in salads. They are seasoned with salt, pepper, oil and vine- 
gar, and are generally eaten cold. Various salad dressings and 
herbs are sometimes used in their preparation. Salads should vary 
according to the season of the vegetables. Care should be taken 
not to bruise 'any of the vegetables used in a salad. Green salads 
make a refreshing breakfast dish. Endives and dandelion should 
be dressed with a plain dressing and a piece of bread rubbed with 
garlic should always be added. The corn-salad or lamb-lettuce 
makes a delicious salad, dressed with pickled beets. A mustard 
dressing should be added to celery, and a few drops of Worcester- 
shire sauce also, to heighten the flavor if desired. Water-cress 
should be served fresh and plain. It is excellent with roasted or 
broiled fowl. Lettuce and cos lettuce are two popular salads. Do 
not dress it until ready to serve. Fine herbs may be added, and 
also a garniture of hard-boiled eggs. Mixed vegetable salads are 
best in spring, when the vegetables are young and tender. In mix- 
ing them see that they harmonize in taste and color. The best 
vegetables for salads are green and white beans, new or pickled 
beets, potatoes, small onions, carrots, artichoke bottoms, asparagus 
tops, green peas, and gherkins. Occasionally some anchovies, 
pickled herrings, capers, olives, truffles, and yolks of eggs may be 
added. Be very careful in seasoning salads. Always season with 



396 HABDEE'S AMERICAN COOKERY. 

the oil first, because if too much vinegar is used it will settle in the 
bottom of the salad bow], instead of mixing with the oil properly. 
Never try to mix the salt with the vinegar. It is best to sprinkle 
it over the salad with the pepper, or it can be mixed with the oil. 
Green salads are used at breakfast or dinner, while the salads that 
are made of fowl or fish are best at a luncheon, supper, or collation. 
Cucumbers and tomatoes can be served with the fish. 

Recipes for making the various kinds of sauces for salads will be 
found in the " Book on Sauces."

them and season with salt, pepper, oil and vinegar. When ready 
to serve the salad, the vegetables are mixed and nicely dressed in a 
salad bowl with a Ravigote or Mayonnaise sauce. For a large salad 
it is best to dress each vegatable in bunches, alternating them, and, 
when they are nicely decorated, the effect is pleasing. This salad is. 
generally composed of the following vegetables in equal quantities, 
but they can be varied, according to the season: Green peas, aspar-

ing. Mix them well together, arrange them properly in a salad 
bowl, and garnish with stoned olives and boned anchovies. 

HOW TO PREPARE MOULDS WITH ASPIC JELLY, FOR SALADS. 

No. 1709. The salads following this recipe are different from the 
foregoing, being made in moulds, and dressed on stands or borders, 
or on bread masked with butter for a relief and as a convenience in 
garnishing. They are used principally at balls and banquets, and 
when nicely executed they form a handsome ornament to a table. 
Much depends upon the proficiency of the party making them; and 
special care should be taken to have the Aspic jelly clear, and not 
too firm. In cold weather it need not be as solid as when the 
weather is warm. They may be made in Charlotte or Timbal moulds, 
if desired; but it is best to use the regular Salad moulds that are 
made expressly for this purpose. They contain a false mould, 
which is inserted after the mould is ornamented. The space around 
this false mould is filled with jelly, and allowed to become firm. 
Warm water is then put in the centre of the mould, so it can be 
removed easily, which leaves the center vacant, to be filled with the 
salad. Then smooth off the top evenly, and set the mould aside to- 
get cold until ready for use. Then dip the mould in warm water, 
wipe it dry, and then turn it out on the dish it is to be served on. 

The mould is prepared, arranged and decorated as follows : Put 
the mould in a pan containing some cracked ice, and let it get cold. 
Put some cool Aspic jelly in the mould, and turn the mould around 
constantly until it is thinly and evenly coated with the jelly on the 
sides and bottom. (It takes considerable practice to do this per- 
fectly.) Drain your vegetables, and dry them well on a napkin. 
Dip each piece separately in a cool Aspic jelly, and arrange them 
in the bottom and around the sides of the mould in the 'design that 
you prefer, alternating the colors. When this is done, line k with 
another coating of jelly, set it aside to get cold, and then fill the 
centre with the prepared salad. Truffl.es, capers, olives and the 
whites of eggs can be used to decorate the mould, instead of vege- 
tables, if desired. 

VEGETABLE SALAD WITH ASPIC JELLY, MACEDOINE. 

No. 1710. This salad is composed of cooked asparagus tops,

vegetables, as in No. 1709. Put the remainder of the vegetables in 
a bowl with a few spoonfuls of Mayonnaise dressing made with 
Aspic jelly. Put the salad in the centre of the mould to fill it. 
Smooth the top, and set the mould aside to get firm. When ready 
to serve, dip the mould in warm water, then turn the salad out on 
the stand on which it is to be served. Garnish the base with aspar- 
agus tops, as in No. 85, and artichoke-bottoms, as in No. 46, with 
some hard boiled eggs cut in halves, and finely-chopped Aspic 
jelly.

take two pickled beets and cut and slice them the same way. Put 
them in separate bowls and season with pepper, salt, oil and vinegar. 
Prepare the fillet of one or two flounders, scrape off the skin, and 
put them in a buttered flat saucepan. Season with salt and pepper 
and add a little white wine. Then cook them, keeping them white, 
and when done put them on a platter and lay them aside to get cold. 
When cold cut them in scallops, add the same quantity of fillet 
of boned Anchovies, and season with pepper, salt, oil and vinegar. 
Decorate the mould with Aspic jelly, capers, olives, anchovies 
and the whites of hard boiled eggs, as in No. 1709. Put the floun- 
ders and anchovies in a bowl and add to them double their quantity 
of potatoes and beets, after they are drained. Also add some 
capers and a few spoonfuls of Mayonnnaise dressing made with 
Aspic jelly. Mix them gently together and then fill the centre of 
the mould. Smooth off the top evenly and set it in a cool place 
until ready for use. When dressing it garnish with hard boiled 
eggs and chopped Aspic jelly.

perfect beans to decorate a Charlotte mould, splitting half of them 
in halves to give a variety to the decoration. Drain the remaining 
beans in a colander, then put them in a bowl, season with pepper, 
salt, oil and vinegar, and add a little finely-chopped parsley or 
chives. Also add a few spoonfuls of Mayonnaise dressing, made 
with Aspic jelly, mix the whole well together, and then fill up the 
centre of the mould. Smooth off the top and set it aside to get 
firm. Finish it the same as the other moulds are finished.

French VETCH, OR TARE. German 

Vesce. Wicke. 

No. 1714. This is a leguminous plant having several varieties, 
all of which, in properties and habits, resemble the common pea, 
the seeds being used for food. It is not cultivated to any extent, as 
it is not prolific. It is cultivated like green peas, and is pre- 
pared for the table in the same manner as peas. It is also 
.ground, mixed with corn or rye, and made into bread. 



ARTICLE CCXXVII. 



WATER-MELON. 

Melon d'Eau. Wasser Melone. 

No. 1715. The Water-melon is a tropical fruit that is largely and 
extensively cultivated in the United States. The fruit is roundish 
or oblong, and in color it is green or of variegated green 
shades. It is much more vigorous than the musk-melon, though 
inferior to the cantaloupe. Its abundant and cooling juice renders 
it very refreshing during summer. It is less liable to injury from 
insects than an} r other variety of melon. 

CULTURE. 

No. 1716. Water-melons require a rich, though rather sandy 
soil for their best development, and thrive best in warm latitudes, 
26 



402 HARDER'S AMERICAN COOKERY. 

growing best in the Southern and Southwestern States. Cultivate- 
exactly the same as for musk-melons, except that the hills should 
be just double the distances apart, namely, eight and ten feet. 

GEORGIA RATTLESNAKE. 

No. 1717. One of the largest varieties, and stands shipment long 
distances better than any other. It is the sort used at the South 
for northern shipments. It is a beautifully striped variety, of very 
large size, with red flesh of the finest flavor. 

CUBAN QUEEN. 

No. 1718. One' of the largest melons known, often attaining up- 
wards of eighty pounds in weight. The vine is vigorous, and the 
skin striped, light and dark green. The flesh is bright red, solid, 
very crisp and sugary. 

CALIFORNIA OR IMPROVED ODELLA. 

No. 1719. One of the best sorts for shipping purposes, as it has 
a tough, thin rind, which enables it to stand an amount of hand- 
ling that would crack open other varieties. The flavor is excellent 
and quite distinct. 

ORANGE. 

No. 1720. So called from its peculiar rind, which separates from 
the flesh when fully ripe. The flesh is red, tender and sweet. 

CITRON AND CALIFORNIA PIE MELON. 

No. 1721. These melons are used in making sweetmeats and 
preserves by removing the rind and seeds, cutting the flesh in pieces 
of equal size, then boiling them in syrup which has been flavored 
with ginger, and then proceeding the same as with musk-melons 
in Nos. 922 and 923. They ripen late in season and will keep until 
December. The flesh is white, solid, tough, seedy, very squashy, 
and unpalatable in its crude state. 

BLACK SPANISH. 

No. 1722. Their small vines enables them to be grown closer 
than any other sorts. They are round in form, and dark-green in 
color. The flesh is scarlet, rich and sugary in flavor. 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE. 403 

SCALY BARK. 

No. 1723. A very popular variety in the South, which will keep 
in good condition after pickling longer than any other sort. The 
vines are large, with coarse foliage, the fruit large and oblong, and 
the flesh red and very tender. 

MOUNTAIN SWEET. 

No. 1724. A large, long oval variety. The flesh is scarlet and 
quite solid to the center, very sweet and delicious. 

ICE CREAM. 

No. 1725. This is medium-sized. The flesh is scarlet and very 
sweet. A good variety for general culture. 

FERRY'S PEERLESS. 

No. 1726. The best melon for general use, particularly in the 
North. The vine is vigorous, hardy and productive. The fruit is 
medium, oval, and finely mottled with light and dark-green, some- 
what in stripes. The rind is thin, and the flesh bright scarlet, solid 
to the centre, crisp, nutty, and sweet. 

EARLY JERSEY. 

No. 1727. One of the earliest varieties, above the medium size, 
oval round, and light-green in color. The flesh is scarlet, solid, 
finely grained, very sweet and juicy. 

HOW TO SERVE MELONS. 

No. 1728. Water-melons are served as a relish, or for dessert, 
and should be kept in a cool place for some time before 
serving. Cut a piece from each end, and then cut the melon in a 
zig-zag shape in the centre, which will divide the melon in half, 
and set each half on a dish with a napkin. Place them on the table, 
and when ready to use, cut them in slices. 

NOTE. Cut a plug out of the melon, pour a glass of brandy inside, replace the plug, keep the 
melon in a cool place, and occasionally turn it. In twenty-four hours the brandy will be absorbed, 
and the melon ready to serve. This makes a delicious change from the ordinary way of eating 
melons.

leaves are dark green and quite free from rust. It has a large, 
bald, smooth, well-filled head, containing from sixteen to eighteen 
breasts, and is rather late in ripening. The berry is of a light 
amber color, good size and very plump and handsome. It has a 
very thin hull and makes but little bran; however it yields a large 
return of flour of the very best quality. 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE. 405 

DEMOCRAT. 

No. 1733. A variety that originated in Pennsylvania and is be- 
coming very popular in Canada. It is very early. The heads are 
bearded and compact, with white chaff. The berry is of a very light 
amber color and is superior for milling qualities. 

FULTZ. 

No. 1734. Although not as showy in the field as the Clawson, 
the Fultz will generally yield quite as much grain that is of a better 
milling quality. It is much esteemed in Pennsylvania and Ohio, 
and is becoming popular elsewhere. The straw stands up well. 
The leaves are large, of a dark green color and free from rust. It 
has smooth, medium-sized, compact heads, containing from sixteen 
to eighteen breasts of two and three kernels each. The berry is of 
a dull amber color, medium in size and long. 

CLAWSON. 

No. 1735. A smooth white Wheat, with red chaff. It is a supe- 
rior variety. 

BED MEDITERRANEAN. 

No. 1736. This is the imported variety fully acclimated. The 
heads are bearded and well filled. It succeeds well in nearly all 
localities, and ripens early. 

WINTER PEARL. 

No. 1737. The heads are beardless, regular and very handsome, 
about five and a half inches long, with from eighteen to twenty 
breasts of four grains each. The kernels are about the size of the 
Clawson, hard, plump, and of a light amber color. It produces 
abundantly in good wheat fields. 



SPRING WHEAT. 

THE INVINCIBLE. 

No. 1738. This is a beardless variety of remarkably robust and 
vigorous growth. The straw is strong, stiff, well glazed and healthy. 
The heads are from four to five inches long, compact and well filled. 
The berry is of a light amber color, plump, hard and very heavy. 
It is wonderfully prolific. The grains ripen quickly and evenly. 



406 HARDER' s AMERICAN COOKERY. 

Care should therefore be taken not to let it get over-ripe before 
harvesting. 

ADAMANT WHEAT. 

No. 1739. This is one of the hardiest and most flinty varieties 
in cultivation, and is very productive and vigorous. It is a beard- 
less, white-chaff' variety, with long narrow heads, closely set with 
medium sized amber-colored kernels, which produce flour of a very 
superior quality. It is one of the most desirable sorts for cultiva- 
tion in the Northwest, Colorado and the Pacific Coast, where hard 
wheat is the favorite sort. 

GREEN MOUNTAIN WHEAT. 

No. 1740. A beardless variety much cultivated in Vermont. The 
straw is of a light yellow color, very strong, and free from rust. 
The heads average five inches in length, and are somewhat tapering. 
The kernels are white, large, plump, very hardy and productive. 

NOTE. For any other Wheat or cereal, see the Articles on Barley, Buckwheat, Corn, etc. 

WHEAT BROTH. 

No. 1741. Soak six ounces of Wheat in water over night. Then 
drain and parboil it for two minutes, after which drain it again, and 
put it in a saucepan with a quart of veal broth. Let it boil slowly 
for an hour, and season it lightly. 

SOUP CREAM OF GREEN FARINA WHEAT. 

No. 1742. Green wheat can be procured in grains or in the same 
way as Farina (Semoule). The latter is preferred, as it cooks much 
quicker. It is greatly relished by Germans. 

Put four quarts of broth in a saucepan, and when it boils drop in 
slowly one pound and a half of the green Farina Wh eat, stirring it 
gently until it boils. Then, set it on the side of the fire to boil 
slowly, and add a faggot of parsley garnished with leeks and green 
onions. Let it cook for one hour, then skim it, take out the faggot, 
and strain the soup through a fine sieve. Then put the soup in a 
saucepan, set it on the fire, and stir it until it boils. Season with 
salt, pepper, and a pinch of sugar. Let it boil slowly for fifteen 
minutes, then set it on the side of the fire to keep warm. Before 
serving add six ounces of butter, and half a pint of cream, diluted 
with the yolks of eight raw egg<. Mix it well until the butter is 
melted.

the single rows being made twelve inches from each other. 



ARTICLE; ccxxx. 



WITLOEF. 

Romaine blanche. Weisser Eiidivieti 

No. 1744. This is a distinct and comparativelv new vegetable, 
somewhat resembling chicory in habit. It produces a moderate 
sized and beautiful white heart, similar in shape to a cos lettuce, 
and when prepared as the latter is, or as a s ilad, it will be found a 
valuable acquisition to the winter vegetables. 



ccxxxi. 



WOOD SORREL. 

Oseille OxaUd>>. Sourklee, 

No. 1745. Wood sorrel is a hardy perennial plant, growing 
naturally in woods, in cool and shaded situations. The leaves are 
radical, inversely heart-shaped, and produce three together at the 
extremity of quite a long stam. The leaves possess a pleasant acid 
taste and are mixed with salads, to which they impart an agreeably 
refreshing flavor. The plant is considered one of the most valuable 
of all vegetables that are cultivated for their acid properties. 



408 HAKDER'S AMERICAN COOKERY. 

CULTURE. 

No. 1746. It may be propagated either by seeds or by dividing 
the roots. The soil should be rich and moist. Sow it in April, in

used as a vermifuge tonic and stomachic. The leaves are also bene- 
ficial to poultry. 

ROMAN WORMWOOD. 

No. 1748. Resembles the common Wormwood, but the leaves are 
smaller and more finely cut; pale-green above and hoary on the 
under surface. It is preferred to the common for medicinal pur- 
poses, as the taste is more agreeable and its odor less pungent. 

SEA WORMWOOD. 

No. 1749. The leaves are numerous, long, narrow and hoary, and 
bitter to the taste. When bruised they emit a strong, pleasant 
aromatic flavor. 

CULTURE. 

No. 1750. They develop best in warm, dry, light soil. They are 
propagated the same as other hardy shrubs. If sown by seeds, 
sow them in April in drills. Transplant the seedlings in rows, two- 
feet apart, and a foot between the seedlings.

the spirit and progress of the age. 



PREFACE. 



'•'What ! " — the reader may exclaim — "Another book on cookery! 
Have we not Careme and Francatelli, Vatel and Soyer, Ude and 
Oouffd, Miss Acton and Mrs. Beeton, Meg Dodds and Mrs. Hale, 
and scores of other authorities on the same subject ? Must every 
cook be an author, and we be asked to read his book, as well as to 
eat of the dishes he prepares ? " Gentle reader, it is to anticipate 
this possible state of mind, and to answer these probable questions, 
that this explanatory preface is submitted. Many a dish is cooked 
that is not worth the time and trouble , even by an ordinarily edu- 
cated palate, given to its discussion, and many a book written — 
esi3ecially on the subject of Cookery — the reading of which is worse 
than time wasted. There have been innumerable Cook Books for 
popular use published, I grant you; but if you ask nine out of ten 
persons who consult them, they will tell you they become more 
and more perplexed as they attempt to follow their guidance. 
The housekeeper will confess she has been led into errors by their 
vague recipes, injurious to the family health, and, at the same time, 
expensive to the family purse. It is to dissipate this fog enveloping 
the literature of the kitchen that the publication of the Book of 
American Practical Cookery is undertaken. The author claims 
that the work is the result of a lifetime of study, constant observa- 
tion, and practical experience in the best culinary establishments 
of both Continents. He, therefore, brings to his task a thorough 
knowledge of the subject, and asserts, fearless of successful contra- 
diction, that the result of his labors will bo the only competent 
treatise — applying culinary science especially to the material condi- 
tions of this country — ever written. He intends it for a trustworthy 
guide to all what to eat and drink, and what to avoid. 



VI PREFACE. 

In pursuance of the plan laid down, lie proposes to embrace' 
the whole list of food articles, their selection, treatment, and best, 
method of preparing them for the table, showing how the utmost 
value can be obtained from every edible designed by the Almighty 
for the comfort and nourishment of mankind. It is due to the 
intelligence of the present age that there should no longer be room 
for the old sneer of the dyspeptic cynic: " God sends the material,, 
but the Devil sends cooks." 

To accomplish this important object will require at least six 
volumes. Marie Antoine Careme, the great French cook, who lived 
between the years 1784 and 1833, and who was called the "regen- 
erator of cookery," took twelve volumes to give Europe of his day 
the information which the author of the present series proposes to 
give America of the present, in six. Each volume of the Ameeican.. 
Practical Cookery series will be devoted to a leading food staple. 
This, the first volume, deals with vegetables and all alimentary 
plants, roots, and seeds grown on the American continent, with full 
remarks of the best varieties, their mode of cultivation, cooking, 
dishing, and other matters of interest connected with this branch of 
the culinary art — one, by the way, of no small importance, but to 
which generally scant attention is paid by the household, and even 
by the club and hotel, cook. 

It comes quite in place here to give a few cursory hints on the 
subject-matter more definitely and precisely stated in the body of 
this volume. In preparing all alimentary plants for the table, the 
best, freshest, and those in season, should always be chosen. Stale 
or decayed vegetables, or those that have been overheated in pack- 
ing, or bruised in transportation, are unwholesome. Avoid them 
if you value your health. Preserved vegetables should not be used 
for the table, if they can be possibly declined. Where their use: 
cannot be avoided, be careful to select those put up at creditable 
establishments, with the name of the proprietor or company, and 
the quality of the goods marked plainly on the package. Often 
flashy and picturesque labels conceal germs of disease, in the shape 
of imperfectly preserved vegetables, sufiicient to cause an epidemic. 
Vegetables should only be freely eaten in the spring, becaUse most 
kinds are then seasonable, and consequently wholesome and nutri- 
tious. Some of the few fall varieties are improved by light frosts^ 



PEEFACE. vii 

Vegetables forced in liot-liouses are uot as good as those grown in 
tlie open air, and subjected to ordinary natural conditions. Tlie 
variety of climate with which the United States is blessed, promotes 
tlie growth of every variety of fruit and vegetable known in the 
world, and the facilities for transportation put nearly every section 
of our country on the same footing, so far as the enjoyment at their 
best of the products of each is concerned. 

In cooking vegetables, good pure water is essential. To cook 
green vegetables properly, they should be put into a vessel while 
the water is boiling — the pot remaining uncovered. By this means 
they will retain their natural color. Vegetables can be served witn 
each course, or alone, before or after the roast. It is better that 
they precede the roast, as the appetite is thereby improved for the 
course that follows. Too many vegetables should not be served 
with a dinner. They ought to be selected with care according to 
the course they accompany. These hints, although general, will 
serve a good purpose in awakening attention. 

In conclusion, the author may, without egotism, again state, that 
he feels confident in his ability to make this series on American 
Practical Cookery a standard work, because he is ^practically 
acquainted with the details of every branch on which he writes, 
and, at the same time, familiar with the broader requirements of 
the culinary profession. A chief cook, besides being versed in the 
technique of the kitchen, should also be a good judge of the kinds, 
qualities and uses of every dietetic article. As the old Greek comic 
poet Dionysius, says: 

" To roast some beef, to carve witli neatness, 
To blow up sauces, and to blow the fire, 
Is anybody's task; he who does this 
Is but a seasoner and a broth-maker. 
A cook is quite another thing. His mind 
Must comprehend all facts and circumstances. 
Where is the place, and what the time of supper, 
Who are the guests, and who the entertainer, 
What fish he ought to buy, and where he ought to buy it," etc. 

The author does not expect to realize a fortune by this publica- 
tion. The work is, in a degree, a labor of love, prompted as much 
by a desire to benefit the culinary art, as by any other feeling. But 



vm PEEFACE. 

thougli his reward may not reach the munificent one of Antony's 
cook, who received a city for his skill in arranging a Cleopatra ban- 
quet, he feels assured at least of the gratitude of all those who wish 
to intelligently enjoy the pleasures of the table, and of the hearty 
appreciation of his fellow-workers in the important field of culinary 

science.

NOTE, 



BS" The entire work on " Ameeioan Peaotical Cookeey," now in course of preparation by Mr. 
Harder, will consist of six volumes, each devoted to a particular article of food — soups, fish, flesh, 
fowl, farinace, sauces, conserves, liqueurs, &c. — and each treated in the same thoroughly exhaustive 
manner exemplified in this, the first of the series. Prefixed, is a glossary of such technical terms 
and phrases as occur in the text of this volume, and which the general reader may have need to 
consult. A copious index will also facilitate reference to the different details of the subjects treated. 
Due notice will be given of the appearance of Volume 11 of the series.

GLOSSARY 



-OF- 



WORDS AND TERMS USED IN THIS BOOK. 



AUemande. — Allemancle sauce is not of German origin, as the name 
would imply, but is the mother and stock of the white French 
sauces. It is made witJi veal and chicken broth, and is then called 
Yeloute'e. After this the yolks of eggs, lemon juice, and essence 
of mushrooms are added. It is fully described in the " Book 
on Sauces." When this sauce can not be made con^'cniently a 
substitute can be made by thickening a veal or chicken broth, 
the same as for butter sauce, letting it boil for fifteen minutes. 
Put the yolks of four raw eggs in a saucepan with four spoon- 
fuls of cream, and mix in slowly one quart of the thickened 
veal or chicken sauce. Add the juice of one lemon, season 
with salt, pepper, and nutmeg, and set it on the fire. Stir it 
continually until it boils, then strain it through a sauce towel. 
Put it in a saucepan and place small pieces of butter on top to 
prevent a crust from forming. 

Annual. — Annual plants are those that must be sown every year. 

Aroma. — The quality or principle of plants or seeds that constitutes 
their fragrance. An agreeable odor. 

Aromatic. — A plant characterized by a pleasant smell, and usually 
by a warm, pungent taste. 

Bain-marie. — Literally a hot water bath. A Bain-marie is a square 
pan in which hot water is kept, and is used to keep saucepans 
in that contain sauces or stews, that are to be kept warm before 
serving. The water must be kept almost at the boiling heat, 
but never allowed to boil. The name Bain-marie is also applied 
to the high saucepans that are made expressly to sit in the 
above mentioned Bain-marie pans. 

Biennial. — Biennial plants are those that last for two years and then 
perish. 

Blanch. — To whiten the stalks or leaves of a plant by earthing them 
up or tying them together to exclude the light. 



XX GLOSSARY. 

Braise. — To cook or stew in a close-covered saucepan or other vessel 
on a slow fire. Formerly hot coals were put on the cover to 
keep the heat even, but an oven is much better and warms the 
vessel thoroughly. 

Brisk Fire. — One burning with a quick, free action. 

Butter. — When the expression "add apiece of butter" is used, it 
depends on the quantity of vegetables cooked. For four per- 
sons, add a piece as large as a walnut. For soups, add from 
four to six ounces. When it is added, toss the vegetables well 
over until the butter is melted. In soups, keep stirring until 
the butter is melted. In this way it thoroughly permeates the 
article being cooked, and gives it a glossy, velvety appearance. 
If it is not stirred, it will remain on the top and impart a greasy 
appearance to the food. 

Calyx. — The outer covering of a flower. 

Capsule. — The seed vessel of a plant. 

Catechu. — A dry, brown, astringent extract, obtained by decoction 
and evaporation from the Acacia Catechu, in India. It contains 
a portion of tannin or tannic acid. 

Cellulose. — The substance left after the action of solvents on vege- 
table tissues. It is convertible into starch and sugar. 

Chopped. — The term "chopped" parsley or onions is used often. 
Before being chopped, parsley must be washed, then dried in a 
towel; the large stems must be removed, and then the leaves 
are chopped. Then put it in a towel and wring out the moist- 
ure; after this dip it in boiling water for a minute, then immerse 
it in cold water and squeeze it dry. By doing this it will retain 
its green color in cooking. Onions should not be chopped or 
they will turn black; they should be cut finely. Parboiled 
vegetables, such as spinach or cabbage, should be drained first 
and then dried before being chopped on a board. Garlic has 
a stronger flavor when mashed than when chopped. 

Clarify. — To make clear. Applied principally to butter, which 
should be melted over a slow fire and then strained through a 
napkin. 

Coagulate. — To curdle or thicken; to change from a liquid to a solid 

mass. 

Colander. — A vessel with the bottom perforated with little holes for 
straining. 

Comfrey. — A genus of plants that abound in mucilage. An emol- 
lient drink is made from the roots. 



GLOSSARY. XXI 

Conical. — Fruit, roots or nuts that have the form of a cone; round 
and decreasing to a point. 

Corsican Sea 3Ioss. — A marine phint which, when boiled in water, 
is used in diet drinks and apozems. 

Cutters. — There are several kinds of cutters for cutting vegetables 
for garnitures. They are made of tin in various shapes — round, 
oval, square, etc. A vegetable spoon-cutter is a sort of a knife 
shaped like a sjDOon, and of numerous different sizes. 

Croio-foot. — A pasture-plant that resembles the common buttercup 
in its flowers, and has acrid properties. If swallowed in its 
fresh state it produces heat and pain in the stomach. It is 
used in diet drinks and apozems. 

Decoction. — The strength of leaves, seeds or other matter, extracted 
by boiling. 

Dilute. — To dissolve, such as the yolks of eggs diluted in milk. 
When they are mixed they should always be strained. Eggs 
and milk are put in purees for the purpose of thickening them. 

Drills. — A light furrow or channel made in the ground to put seed 
into in sowing. 

Esculent. — Any plant that is fit for food, though sometimes used as 
a general name for edible roots. 

Espagnole Sauce. — This is the stock sauce of almost all of the brown 
sauces. It is made of good stock broth, thickened with cooked 
flour, and then flavored. It is fully described in the "Book on 
Sauces." When this sauce cannot be made conveniently, an 
ordinary brown sauce can be substituted, which is made as fol- 
lows: Make an ordinary stock broth; then thicken, and flavor 
it lightly with ham, vegetables and Madeira wine. When done 
it must be free from grease. 

Expression. — The act of pressing or squeezing out. 

Faggot. — A term applied to a bunch of vegetables and herbs that 
are tied together with a string, so it can be removed conven- 
iently when the article is cooked. It is used in soups, sauces, 
and stews. See No. 1039. 

Farina. — Fine dust or powder contained in the anthers of plants.

originated in Syria, where it grows along the banks of rivers near 
high mountains. It is cultivated in the United States but is of in- 
ferior quality. The plant is highly esteemed in its preserved state, 
and much used by pastry cooks and confectioners. The best An- 
gelica now preserved comes from Niort, where the old formula is 
adhered to, as when made by the Nuns of the "Visitation of St.

No. 6. — The plants thrive best in damp localities, but may be 
grown in well enriched soil. Sow in drills, ten inches apart. Allow 
the young plants to remain until the following spring, then set them 
out two feet asunder, in each direction. The stalk, which is a 
cylindrical, hollow, herbaceous stem, will be fit for use by June of 
the following year. If the flower stem is removed, as it makes its 
appearance, the plants will put forth fresh sprouts from the sides 
of the root, and survive three years, but when allowed to blossom 
and perfect their seeds the plants soon perish. 

ANGELICA SYRUP.

French ARTICHOKE. German 

Arlichaut. Artishoke. 

No. 18. — Artichokes were first discovered in Italy, but are now 
planted in all large gardens in the United States, and are used as 
a vegetable, and prepared for the table in various ways. There are 
five kinds of Artichokes, viz : The Yiolet, the White, the Green, 
the Eed, and the Sweet. They are called the Globe Artichokes, 
which differ from the Jerusalem Artichoke. The Sweet Artichoke 
is preferable to all others for its delicious flavor. It grows very 
small, and its plants are very productive for two years. It is rare 
yet in this country. The Green, which is the variety in general 
use, is large and juicy. The Red, which is more delicate than the 
Green, is picked when young, and is mostly used for eating in the 
raw state, or in salad. The Yiolet grows as large as the Green, but 
is not as profitable in culture. The White is very productive, but 
very troublesome to raise, and owing to this is very rare in the 
market. 

Artichokes when eaten raw take long to digest, but when cooked 
are very agreeable. They are cooked in various ways as a vegetable 
for the table, and are used for garnitures and soups. 

CULTURE. 

No. 19. — Sow in April in rich soil, and transplant the following 
spring to permanent beds, in rows or drills, three feet apart and 
two feet between the plants. The first season will only give a par- 
tial crop, but as it is a perennial, after being once planted the beds 
will remain in bearing for years. They should be protected in 
winter by a covering of leaves or coarse manure. 

GREEN LARGE GLOBE. 

No. 20. — Is the best for general culture and use. The edible 
portion is the undeveloped flower heads, which should be used be- 
fore they begin to open, and the stalk should then be cut to the 
ground, for if the flowers expand they weaken the plant. In the 
large Globe the buds are large — nearly round; scales deep green, 
shading to purple, very thick and fleshy, the bottom of which is the 
edible part. 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE. 7 

HOW TO PREPAEE ARTICHOKES FOR COOKING. 

No. 21. — Do not use Articliokes when they have developed. If 
once open they are not good for cooking. Cut off the stem, trim 
off the hard leaves around the bottom, and cut off the upper quarter 
of the Artichoke leaves. Then scoop out the fibrous part in the 
middle and put them in a pan of cold water acidulated. When thus 
prepared put them in boiling water, add a little salt and lemon 
juice, and cook until tender. When done drain them on a napkin. 

ARTICHOKES WITH HOLLANDAISE SAUCE.

Vinaigrette sauce separately. 

ARTICHOKES, WITH OIL OR POIVRADE SAUCE. 

FOR BELISH OR SIDE DISH. 

No. 25. — The small tender ones are served raw, after being 
cleaned of the fibrous parts and dished up on a napkin. The large 
ones are cut into quarters, trimmed of the hard leaves. Eemoving 
all the fibrous parts, keep them in cold water, in which add a little 
vinegar. Serve them in a relish dish, adding the juice of lemons 
which will keep the artichokes from turning black. Serve the sauce 
separately in a sauce bowl. 

ARTICHOKES, WITH OIL AND VINEGAR SAUCE. 

No. 26. — Take the yolks of two hard boiled eggs, mash them 
into a fine paste, put them into a bowl with two fine chopped

ARTICHOKES — BARIGOULE. 

No. 27. — Trim one dozen middle sized artichokes, cut the top 
leaves off in the middle, trim the bottom round and with a tea- 
spoon scoop out all the fibrous part. Put them in cold water with 
a little vinegar, and when all cleaned parboil them for a few minutes, 
then immerse them in cold water. Drain them on a napkin to absorb 
all the moisture from them. Chop eight shallots very fine and put 
them in a saucepan with two ounces of scraped fresh fat pork. Fry 
lightly, then add a quarter of a pound of fine chopped mushrooms, 
one handful of fresh bread crumbs and a little chopped parsley; 
season well. Fill the centre of the artichokes with this preparation, 
cover each with a thin . slice of fat pork, place them in a deep flat 
saucepan lined with a layer of thin sliced fat pork. Moisten with 
a clear madeira wine sauce (or mirpoix), put on the lid and simmer 
gently in the oven for three quarters of an hour. When done and

French ASPARAGUS. German 

Asperge. Spargel. 

No. 65. — The Asparagus is one of the best table vegetables, 
having a delicious flavor, and being easily prepared. It can be 
had nearly all the year round, but is best when in season. To have 
them at perfection they need great care in their cultivation. The 
best flavored and most tender are those raised under cover and kept 
from the rays of the sun. There are four varieties: the green, 
violet, white and wild Asparagus. The white is savory and agree- 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE. 19 

able for eating wliole, but contains little substance. The violet 
grows large and is very substantial and preferred by all gourmets. 
The green is smaller and more common and is generalh^ used for 
soups and purees. The wild is used for medical purposes. The 
water in which Asparagus has been boiled, when cold, is a refresh- 
ing drink, and can be used to advantage by persons troubled with 
kidney complaint. 

CULTUEE 

No. 66. — Sow early in spring, as soon as the ground will admit 
of working, in rows a foot apart. Keep carefully hoed and clear 
from weeds, and the plant will be in condition to set out in the suc- 
ceeding spring. The soil for the permanent beds should be thor- 
oughly manured and trenched or plowed to a depth of at least one 
foot. Plant in rows, spread the roots well out and let the crown of 
the plant be set deep enough so that it will be covered from five to 
eight inches. In heavy soil the covering must be less tha,n in 
light soil. After sowing the seeds, tread them firmly in with the feet. 

COLOSSAL. 

No. 67. — The best variety, unrivaled in size, deep green in color, 
tender and good in quality. 

GIANT. 

No. 68. — A popular variety, producing green and purple shoots, 
according to the soil. It grows very hardy but not as large as the 
Colossal. 

CKOSSBRED. 

No. 69. — It retains the head closed until the stalks are quite 
long and is of a uniform color, while for tenderness and quality it 
is unsurpassed. The size is medium large, and uniform, 

. SMALL DEFIANCE.

ASPARAGUS, PRESEEVED IN SALT. 

No. 93. — Pick out middle sized, sound and fresli cut Asparagus, 
Put into the bottom of a square water-tight wooden box, which you. 
intend filling, a layer of salt, then a layer of Asparagus, then a 
layer of salt, a layer of Asparagus, continuing until filled. On tLie 
top layer have the salt one-half an inch thick, and have a wooden 
cover to fit closely on the box, with a weight on top to keep it 
pressed down, and keep them in a cool dry place. When ready to 
use them soak them for three hours in cold water, then scrape them 
the ordinary way, and put them to soak in lukewarm water for five 
hours, changing the water occasionally, then cook them as required. 

ASPARAGUS, PRESERVED IN CANS. 

No. 94. — Square boxes, the size of the Asparagus, are much bet- 
ter than the round high boxes generally used by factories. When 
the boxes are properly made they can be used several times for the 
same purpose. Each box should contain from twenty-five to thirty 
Asparagus. After the Asparagus stems are scraped, wash them in 
cold water, tie them in bundles, and cut them all the same size. 
Parboil them for five minutes in water lightly salted, then immerse 
them in cold water, drain' them and pat on a linen towel to dr}'- 
Then arrange them in boxes so that the bottom half will have their 
heads towards the right, and the top half will have their heads to- 
wards the left. Cover them with cold boiled water, lightly salted; 
solder on the cover and boil the cans in a hot bath for one and one- 
half hours. 

ASPARAGUS TOPS, PRESERVED. 

No. 95. — Use fresh green Asparagus, and all the same size. Cut 
off the heads and keep them separate. Then cut the remaining 
tender part the size of a large pea. Parboil the heads one minute 
and the others five minutes. Immerse them in cold water, then 
drain them and dry on a napkin. Mix them together and put them 
into round quart tin cans. Cover them with cold boiled water, 
lightly salted; solder on the cover and boil them in a hot water 
bath for one hour. 

ASPARAGUS SYRUP. 

No. 96. — Cut off the tender part of four bunches of Asparagus, 
and wash them well in cold water. Put them in a saucepan with one 
gallon of water, letting them cook until it is reduced to five pints of 
water. Drain them and then strain the liquid through a flannel fil- 
ter, adding four pounds of cube sugar. Cook to a syrup of 32 de- 
grees, and when cold put in bottles, corked tight. •

French ASPARAGUS BEAN. German 

Haricot Asperge. Spar gel Bohne. 

No. 97. — The Asparagus Bean is a distinct variety from the gar- 
den bean, being a native of the southern part of South America 
and China. The pods measure over one foot in length, and the 
beans are cultivated on account of their long pods, which are crisp 
and tender, having a rich flavor, and being much esteemed for 
pickling. The seeds are quite small, and are seldom eaten in their 
green or ripe state. 



ARTICIvB XI. 



BALM. 

Baume. Melisse. 

No. 98. — Balm is a hardy perennial aromatic plant. Originally 
from the southern part of Europe. The leaves have a fragrant 
odor, similar to lemons, and are used for making Balm Tea, for use 
in fever, and makes a pleasant beverage of Balm wine for diseases 
of the lungs, being also used in seasoning meats and for flavoring 
vinegar. A mixture of Balm and honey is sometimes applied to 
the interior of bee hives just previous to receiving the swarm for 
the purpose of their settlement, to attract them. 

CULTURE. 

No. 99. — Prepare a rich sandy soil and keep it clear of weeds. 
Plant early and thin to ten inches apart. The plants will soon 
completely cover the ground, and the bed with good management 
will last several years. When drying, the plants should be cut as 
they come into bloom, separating the stems at the surface of the 
ground. Spread them in an airy shady place and allow them to dry 
gradually. The leaves may be used in their green state directly 
from the plants, as they are required. 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE. 27 



ARTICIvB XII. 



French BALM MINT. German 

Melisse, Melisae. 

No. 100. — The Balm Mint is a hardy perennial aromatic plant, 
similar to the Balm, but different in flavor, being often taken for 
Mint, on account of its flavor. It is used for seasoning game and 
flavoring vinegar and spirituous waters. Culture same as Balm. 



Articlb XIII. 



BARLEY. 

Orge. Gerste. 

No. 101. — The common Barley is a cereal, the flour obtained 
from its grains containing very little gluten, but an abundance of 
fecula, also containing a mucilaginous substance. For this reason 
it produces a bread less savory and less digestible than other flours. 
The Pearl Barley, when entirely removed of its pellicle, is reduced 
to a small pearl. It is much used for culinary purposes in replac- 
ing rice, and also in making soups for invalids. 

COMMON BA.ELEY. 

No. 102. — Barley succeeds best in lands more sandy and lighter 
than those adapted to wheat. It is sown in the spring and can be 
grown further north than any other grain. Unless intended for 
seed, it should be cut before being fully ripe, as it is then heavier, 
of better quality, and less liable to shell. The land should always 
be rolled immediately after sowing. 

BARLEY MANSURY. 

No. 103. — This is a six-rowed Barley with long, heavy well filled 
heads, containing large plump grains. The straw is bright, very 
strong, and is not apt to lodge even in the richest lands. Ripens 
a week later than the common six-rowed Barley, or about the same 
time as two-rowed Barley. 



28 haedee's ameeican cookeey. 

baeley naked, oe hullness. 

No. 104. — This is a peculiar grain, and not generally known. 
The corolla is not attached to the grain, and in this it resembles 
wheat. It is a splendid grain for all the purposes for which Barley- 
is used, and will make an excellent bread when bolted and ground 
like wheat. 

SOUPS. 

CEEAM BAELEY, NEILSON STYLE. 

No. 105. — Put in a saucepan half a pound of butter, and when 
melted add a handful of flour and four handfuls of Pearl Barley, 
stirring it with a wooden spoon for fifteen minutes. Then add in 
slowly one gallon of veal or chicken broth; make it boil, and then 
set on the side of the fire to boil slowly, adding a faggot of parsley 
garnished, with two leeks and two green onions. Season with salt 
and pepper, and let it boil slowly for an hour and a half. Then skim 
off the grease and take out the faggot. Strain it through a fine sieve 
and put back in saucepan to keep warm. When ready to serve add 
the following preparation: Take a pint of cream and the yolks of 
six raw eggs, mix them well, and strain through a strainer. Add six 
ounces of butter, stirring it well until the butter is melted. Serve 
with a garniture royal. 

CEEAM BAELEY, MAEIE LOUISE STYLE. 

No. 106. — Prepare the soup same as No. 105. When moistened 
with the broth and it boils add two raw chickens, letting them boil 
slowly until they are cooked. Then take out the chickens and the 
faggot, skim off" the grease and strain through a fine sieve. Season 
with salt and pepper and set on the fire to keep warm. Take the 
breasts of the chickens and pound them into a fine paste with six 
ounces of butter. Then rub it through a fine sieve and put it in a 
saucepan, adding a pint of cream, the yolks of six eggs and a pinch 
of sugar. Then add the hot soup slowly while stirring briskly with 
a whisk. Serve with a garniture of green peas. 

CEEAM OF BAELEY, FAEEAGUT STYLE. 

No. 107. — Prepare the soup in a similar way to No. 105. When 
strained set it on the fire to keep warm, and when ready to serve 
add six ounces of crawfish butter, diluted in their broth, the yolks 
of six raw eggs and a glass of cream, stirring well until the butter 
is melted. Serve with a garniture of fried peas. 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE. 29 

BAELEY BEOTH FOE INVALIDS. 

No. 108. — Wash two handfuls of Pearl Barley in cold water. 
Put in a saucepan on the fire with three quarts of plain chicken 
broth, and let it boil slowly for two hours. Press the liquid through 
a fine sieve and season lightly. When common Barley is used for 
these recipes put on the fire with cold water, and as soon as it 
boils strain off and proceed as with Pearl Barley. 

BAELEY WATEE FOE INVALIDS. 

No. 109. — Prepare same as No. 108. Use water instead of broth. 
When cooked press the liquid through a fine sieve. Serve plain or 
sweeten with sugar. 

BAELEY CEEAM FOE INVALIDS. 

No. 110. — Prepare the Barley as in No. 108. Use milk in place 
of broth. When well cooked press the liquid through a fine sieve 
and sweeten with a syrup of marsh mallow or venus hair. 

BAELEY WATEE FOE GAEGLING. 

No. 111. — When Barley water is made for gargling with briar 
leaves and honey, use the plain common Barley without changing 
the fresh water as with No. 108. When the Barley water is made 
pour it boiling over the briar leaves, then add a soup spoonful of 
honey and one of wane vinegar. 



ArTPICIvK XIV. 



French BASIL SWEET. German 

Basilic. Basilikum. 

No. 112. — There are four kinds of Basil. The large sweet Basil 
is the one principally used for culinary purposes. It is a hardy 
annual plant, and must be cut before it gets in full bloom. The 
seeds and stems are dried and used for flavoring soups and sauces, 
etc. It is also used when young and tender to mix with cooked 
vegetable salads, such as potatoes, beets, peas, beans, etc. 



30 haedee's ameeican cookeet. 

CULTUEE. 

No. 113. — All the varieties are annual and grow from seed. Sow 
as early as the ground will permit, in sandy soil carefully prepared. 
For winter use the stalks are cut while in flower, then dried, pow- 
dered and preserved as other pot herbs. 



Artict.k XV. 



BAY LEAVES, OR LAUREL LEAVES (Common). 

French CSerman 

Laurier Franc ou dappolon. Lorbeerblatt. 

No. 114. — These leaves are much used for culinary purposes, be- 
ing indispensable for stews, etc.. For these purposes they should 
be used in their dry state, as they then lose their bitter taste. 
In their green state they are used for pickling, and in imparting 
an aromatic taste to meats. 



ArTICIvK XVI. 



BAY OR LAUREL LEAVES (Larustine). 
Laurier Amande. Lorbeerblatt. 

No. 115. — These are not used much for culinary purposes, but in 
dairies they are frequently used to aromatize the milk. They should 
be used with precaution. Although they give an agreeable taste 
to the milk they are dangerous to use, being slightly poisonous. 



Article XVII. 



BEANS. 

Haricot. Bohne. 

No. 116. — This is a vegetable of which there are many varieties. 
They are prepared for the table in several different ways. Some 
varieties, when young and tender, are eaten whole, and are known 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE. 31 

as String Beans. Later on they get liulled, when the seeds are ripe, 
and are called the Shell Bean (French, Flageolet). Next they are 
dried and then prepared in various ways. The White Marrow Fat, 
the Golden "Wax, and the Dwarf Soisson are among the best varie- 
ties. To have Beans well cooked pure water must be used, some 
varieties having hard shells, which will not boil tender. This can 
be remedied by adding some carbonate of soda while they are being 
boiled. For early cultivation the American Garden Bush Bean is 
the earliest and hardiest. The Garden Bush or Pole Running Beans 
are tender annual plants, originally from the East Indies. The 
dwarf varieties require no poles or sticks for their support. 

CTJLTUEE OF THE DWAEF OR BUSH BEAN. 

No. 117. — A succession of sowing can be made according to the 
latitude. Plant in drills about two inches deep, and from eighteen 
inches to two feet apart, according to the richness of the soil. 

EARLY FEEGEE. 

No. 118. — The earliest variety and very prolific. 

EARLY RED VALENTINE. 

No. 119. — Tender and succulent, and of excellent flavor. They 
continue longer in their green state than most varieties. 

WHITE VALENTINE. 

No. 120. — Similar in growth to the red valentine. It is a very 
prolific bearer, and the fact of the bean being white gives it addi- 
tional value, as it enables it to be used as a shell bean. 

GALLEGA, OR LARGE REFUGEE. 

No. 121. — A standard sort for market or private use. Is very 
prolific; pods and beans are large. 

EARLY MOHAWK.

CEYSTAL WHITE WAX. 

No. 128. — Produces pods of fair size of exceedingly rich and ten- 
der flavor. In color waxy white, and almost as transparent as glass. 
It is a stringless variety, very productive, and the pods though 
quick to develop are slow to harden. 

GOLDEN WAX. 

No. 129. — Is an entirely different variety, the pods are large, long, 
and brittle, and entirely stringless. As a snap bean it excels all 
others in richness and tenderness of flavor, and has the further 
merit of being one of the best shell beans grown for winter use. 

EEFUGEE OE A THOUSAND TO ONE. 

No. 130. — Very productive, though not early. The young pods 
are extremely tender and of fine flavor. 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE. 66 

LARGE WHITE KIDNEY. 

No. 131. — An excellent shell bean, green or ripe. 

WHITE MAEEOWFAT. 

No. 132. — Extensively grown for dry state. Of average quality 
as a string bean, but excellent when shelled either green or dry. 

DWAEF SOISSON. 

No. 133. — 1» an early variety. They blossom six weeks after 
planting. Can be used with pods after seven weeks, and ripen in 
ninet}' days. The seeds are white kidney shaped, often flattened, 
bent, or distorted. They are productive, and the young pods are 
of fair quality. The seeds are excellent, whether used green or 
ripe. The skin is thin. They are much esteemed for their white- 
ness and delicate flavor. 

BEANS, POLE EUNNING. 

No. 134. — They are more tender and require rather more care in 
culture than the Bush Beans. They succeed best in sandy loam, 
which should be liberally enriched with short manure in the hills, 
which are formed according to the variety, from three to four feet 
apart. 

LAEGE WHITE LIMA. 

No. 135. — They are considered the best of all the Pole Beans, and 
are almost universally grown. 

SMALL LIMA, OR SIEVA. 

No. 136. — It is earlier and more hardy than the large White Lima. 

DREER's IMPROVED LIMA. 

No. 137. — This is an extra quality of bean which matures early,, 
and yields largely. It produces more shelled beans to the pole 
than the large Lima.

NOTES ON BEANS. 

No. 205. — When beans are boiled with salt pork they should not

use any that is rancid. 

When bacon is used, trim it and then parboil it for five minutes. 
Then immerse it in cold water to remove the smoky taste. 

Dry Beans should first be carefully picked, as there are always 
small stones and pieces of earth mixed with them. Wash them 
well in cold water, and allow them to soak in fresh water over 
night. 

When dry Beans are soaked in lukewarm water, and the water is 
several times renewed, they will cook much quicker than when 
soaked in cold water.

Frci:c:ix BEKTS. German 

Bellerave. Runhel Rube. 

No. 206. — The Beet is a liardy biennial root plant of a blood-red 
color. It contains a large substance of sngar and is much used as 
a vegetable, for salads, and as a relish. It is refreshing and nu- 
tritious when properly prepared. There are five varieties of Beets. 
The Swiss chard, or sea-kale Beet, is a distinct vegetable and much 
superior to the common Beet for greens. If sown at the same time 
as the common varieties, it will be fit to use before them. Later 
on the plants form broad, flat, beautiful white and wax- like stems 
to the leaves, which are very delicious when cooked. The 3'oung 
leaves of the common varieties are cooked with sorrel, or cooked 
and prepared the same as spinach. Still another, variety is called 
the mangel, wdiich is seldom used for the table. 

CULTURE. 

No. 207. — The soil which is suitable for the culture of the Beet 
is that which is rather light than otherwise, provided always that it 
is thoroughly enriched by manure. Sow them in drills one foot 
apart and two inches deep. When the plants have attained three 
or four leaves then thin them out so they may stand five or six 
inches apart. Keep them free from weeds by hand weeding or 
hoeing. In October the roots may be taken up and stored in the 
cellar or in pits outside, like potatoes, care being taken that they 
are not bruised or injured in the process. 

EGYPTIAN BEET TUENIP. 

No. 208. — The earliest Beet and one of the leading market sorts, 
having a deep crimson color. 

BASTIAN's blood TUENIP. 

No. 209. — -An early variety of a blood red color, when properly 
cooked. 

DEWING's blood BEET.

EARLY YELLOW BEET. 

213. — Similar to the blood red, but ditferent in color. The flesh 
is yellow, tender and sweet. 

PINE APPLE BEET. 

No. 214. — A highly esteemed English variety of rich deep crim- 
son color.

white. 

SWISS CHARD, OR SEA KALE BEET. 

No. 216. — This variety is cultivated solely for its leaves. The 
midrib is stewed and served the same as asparagus, and the other 
parts of the leaves are used like spinach. If it is cut often, new 
and more tender leaves will be produced. 

HOW TO PREPARE BEETS FOR COOKING. 

No. 217, — Beets when young are prepared as a vegetable for the 
table. They must be boiled whole, without having anything cut 
from them except the tops. These must always be cut an inch from 
the root and care taken not to injure the root, for if it is in any way 
injured the beet will lose its flavor and color. When boiled let 
them get cold, then peel or rub off the skin and prepare as needed. 

BOILED BEETS STEWED. 

No. 218. — Boil the Beets, and when done skin and slice them. 
If large, cut them in two and put them in a saucepan. Season with 
salt and pepper and add a piece of butter, tossing them over the 
fire. Serve hot, or boil a glass of vinegar with a piece of butter, 
seasoned with salt and pepper, and pour it over the Beets.

wooden spoon. Dilute this with a small wine-glassful of vinegar 
and some white broth to make a light sauce. Add three dozen 
young boiled Beets, cut into quarters, allowing them to simmer for 
fifteen minutes. 

ROAST BEETS. 

No. 223. — Use medium sized Beets. Rub them with a towel 
well impregnated with brandy, lay them on a wire crate and place 
it into a roasting pan. This mode will permit them to cook more 
evenly, as it takes about sis hours to have them properly done. 
The crust of the Beet will then be carbonized. In cooking- Beets 
in this manner all the sugary substance of the Beet concentrates in 
the center. It makes a most delicious dish, but is seldom prepared 
in this way in consequence of the time used in cooking.

frying batter and fry in hot lard. Drain them on a napkin and dish 
them up and garnish with fried parsley. 

Note. — Burnet or chives finely chopped may be used with the parsley in seasoning them. 

BEET SUGAR. 

No. 226. — Beets are largely cultivated for the manufacture of 
sugar, which was first made about 1812, by a French chemist, dur- 
ing the blockade and siege of the First Empire. Beet sugar is 
cheaper than that made from the cane, but is not so profitable in 
its use. 

BEET JU/CE FOR SOUPS. 

No. 227. — Beet juice is made for certain kinds of Polish soups, as 
is explained in the book on soups. Peel and cut in quarters enough 
of the finest kind of red beets to fill a small barrel. After putting 
them in the barrel pour in a sufficient quantity of cold water to 
cover them. Then put a linen cloth over the top and the cover 
over that. Place the barrel where the temperature is mild, to allow 
the liquid to ferment. In eight or ten days drain off' the liquid and 
use it as directed. If bread crumbs or barley is used it will bring 
on fermentation much quicker.

seeds are used for food (being first parched), stewed with meats, 
and are also used for puddings— the same as rice. An oil is 
extracted from the seed, which does not easily become rancid, and 
is used for softening and whitening the skin. The leaves, if 
immersed in a tumbler of water, will convert it into a mucilaginous 
drink, very beneficial in cases of cholera-infantum and diarrhoea.

cauliflower, its branches being longer and separate. It is prepared 
in all the styles that cauliflower is prepared in. 

CULTURE. 

No. 242. — In the Northern States sow them in May and transplant 
in June. In the Southern States sow them in July and transplant 
in August, as they dislike summer heat more than cold weather. 
They succeed best in a moist and rather cool atmosphere. Sow in 
deep rich soil, with an abundance of moisture, which in dry seasons 
must be applied artificially.

BRUSSELS SPROUTS. 

Choux de Bruxelles. Sprossen Kohl. 

No. 250. — Brussels Sprouts are small cabbage sprouts the size of 
a nut. They get green in the latter part of the fall, and are one of 
the best of winter vegetables, gradually becoming more and more 
appreciated in the United States. The plant grows from two to 
three feet in height, and produces from the axils of the leaves, an 
abundance of sprouts, which have an excellent and mild flavor. 

CULTUEE. 

No. 251. — The culture is the same as for cabbage. If early 
plants are raised in hot beds they will perfect themselves in Sep- 
tember. When the winters are not very severe they may remain in 
the ground, to be cut as needed.

HOW TO PREPARE BRUSSELS SPROUTS EOE COOKING. 

No. 254. — Wash tlie Sprouts in plenty of cold water, take off the 
outer leaves, drain them and put them into a saucepan with boiling 
water lightly salted. Let them cook on a brisk fire until tender. 
and then immerse them in cold water, and when cold drain them, 
discarding the fallen leaves from the sprouts. If used as a garniture 
they should not be boiled as much as when used as a vegetable.

Plantcdn ou Corn cU Serf. Pdradiesfeiye. 

No. 261. — Tliis is a hardy annual. The root leaves are put forth 
horizontally, and spread regularly about a common center, somewhat 
in the form of a rosette. The plant is cultivated for its leaves, 
which are used as a salad. They should be plucked while young 
and tender, or when half-grown. 

CULTURE. 

No. 262. — It succeeds best in soil comparatively light. Sow in 
April in shallow drills, eight inches apart. When the plants are 
about an inch high thin them to four inches apart. 



Article XXVII. 



BUCKWHEAT. 

Sarrasin ou ble noir. Buchweitzen. 

No. 263. — Buckwheat originated in Asia, but it is now universally 
grown. It is easily cultivated, and in a favorable climate Avill 
produce two croj)s. Its use is healthful and nourishing, and it is 
easy of digestion, especially when boiled with milk. When cold, 
after having been boiled, it is cut in slices and fried. When the 



58 harder' S AMERICAN COOKERY. 

Buckwheat fiour is made into batter, it makes a winter breakfast 
clisli well known to and appreciated bj all Americans. Buckwheat, 
when made into bread, is only good while in its fresh state, for as 
soon as it becomes dry it splits, and on being cut, crumbles into 
small pieces and becomes hard to digest. 

COMMON BUCKWHEAT. 

No. 264. — Buckwheat should be sown about the middle of June, 
and should be threshed as soon as it is dry, on the ground of a 
barn floor. If allowed to stand in mass it quickly gathers moisture. 

SILVER HULLED BUCKWHEAT. 

No. 265. — This variety is a great improvement on the ordi- 
nary Buckwheat. Sown at the same time as the common Buck- 
wheat, it continues in bloom longer, matures earlier, and yields 
nearly double under the same conditions. The grain is of a 
beautiful light gray color, varying slightly in shade, and the corners 
are much less prominent than in the ordinary variety, while the 
husk is thinner, thereby saving twenty per cent, in the process of 
manufacturing into flour. 

BUCKWHEAT CAKES WITH YEAST. 

No. 266. — Put three pounds of Buckwheat flour into a pan, and 
make a hole in the center of the flour. Pour into this three pints 
of water, two ounces of dissolved compressed yeast, and two 
tablespoonfuls of salt, and mix them slowly to make a light batter 
without lumps. Gather the sides together, cover the pan with a 
cloth and set it in a warm place overnight to raise. Next morning 
mix it up gently before baking. 

Note.— When a little syrup is added to the batter in the morning, they will bake to a nicer 
color. A handful or two of corn meal is often added while mixing the Buckwheat flour. 

BUCKW^HEAT CAKES WITH BAKING POWDER. 

No. 267. — Put into a pan three pounds of Buckwheat flour and 
three soup-spoonfuls of baking powder. Mix them up well, and 
make a hole in the center of the flour, into Avhich pour three pints 
of luke-warm water and two tablespoonfuls of salt and mix to a 
light batter. Ten minutes after mixing, bake it. Should the 
cakes not be light enough, add a little more baking powder, as the 
majority of baking powders are very unreliable. 

Note.— There is to be had a prepared Buckwheat flour, which is much preferable for small 
families. This flour is easily prepared, it being only necessary to use luke-warm water and salt, but 
the batter must be used as soon as mixed. 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE, 59 

BAKING OP BUCKWHEAT CAKES. 

No. 268. — Much depends on tlie cooking of the cakes to have 
them done properly. First, the griddle must always^be very clean, 
heated evenly, and should not be allowed to get burning hot. Grease 
it lightly with leaf lard, and drop enough batter to make ordinary 
sized cakes. Let them cook on one side before turning them, and 
serve them hot with sugar or syrup.

freiicli CABBAGK. German 

C houx pomme . Kopf kohl. 

No. 273. — The Cabbage is a biennial plant and is propagated from 
seed sown annually. Cabbage is a plant extensively used and is 
prepared in various ways. It is very nutritious and there are many 
varieties. The white, the green and the red may be had all the 
year round. The cauliflower, brocoli, Brussels sprouts and kale all 
belong to the Cabbage family. Cabbage should be well cooked, 
otherwise it will cause indigestion. In boiling Cabbage, if the water 
is changed, it will remove that strong odor disliked by many. To 
preserve Cabbage during winter, pall them on a dry day and turn 
them over on their heads for a few hours so as to let them drain. 
Set them in a cool cellar or bury them with their heads down in 
long trenches in a dry situation. In the Middle States bury the 
heads and parts of the stamp in the open ground, placing over them 
a light covering of straw or boards to protect them from severe 
weather. The Savoy Cabbage is the best of the white sorts. The 
Ted Cabbage is formed the same as the other Cabbages, and onlj^ 
differs from them in color, and is preferred by many to the other 
sorts. It is best in the fall and throughout winter and keeps well, 
but the outer leaves must be occasionally removed, or else they 
will decay. 

CULTUEE. 

No. 274. — For the successful culture of Cabbage the very best 
quality of seed must be used. A heavy moist and fresh loam is most 
suitable, and should be highly manured, as well as deeply worked. 
The early sorts should be sown very early in hot beds, hardened 
off and transplanted eighteen to twenty inches apart, early in the 
spring. In the South, sow them from the middle of September to 
the middle of October, and transplant into cold frames, to preserve 
them through the winter, setting them into open ground as early 
as possible. The late autumn and winter varieties may be sown 
from the middle to the last of spring, and transplanted when about 
six inches high, three feet apart each way. Shade and water the 
late sowings in dry weather to get them up. It is important that 
the plants should stand thinly in the seed bed, or they will run up 
weak and slender, and be liable to make long stumps. In 
transplanting they must be set in the ground up to the first leaf, 
no matter how long the stem maj'- be. Cabbages should be hoed

STUFFED CABBAGE. 



No. 306. — Trim off the first outer leaves of two middle-sized solid 
heads of Cabbage. Then parboil the Cabbages for twenty minutes, 
after which immerse them in cold water and drain them on a napkin. 
Then cut out the stalk and turn the leaves carefully out from the 
center. Have a stuffing prepared, composed of two pounds of 
sausage meat seasoned with salt, pepper and spices, with which add 
some cooked fine herbs, the yolks of four hard-boiled eggs chopped 
fine, and two dozen roasted chestnuts. Put this stuffing into the 
center of the Cabbages and replace the leaves so as to form the 
shape of the Cabbage. Cover the opening with a thin slice of faii 
pork and tie up the Cabbages with a string so that they may retain 
their shape. Have a saucepan large enough to hold the Cabbage, 
and line it with thin slices of pork. Put the Cabbages into the 
saucepan, leaving the opening on top. Garnish them with one sliced 
carrot, two whole onions (into which stick half a dozen cloves), a 
faggot of parsley, with a sprig of thyme and one bay leaf. Season

SAUER KRAUT. 



No. 326. — Saner Kraut is a German preparation and is highly 
esteemed by tliem, when well prepared. It is made in large quanti- 
ties in this country, especially in the Northern States. It is seldom 
made in private families here, as it can be so readily procured of 
dealers at all times. To malie good Saner Kraut, only the best of 
cabbage heads should be used. When prepared to keep for a 
certain length of time, use new barrels, or those which have con- 
tained vinegar or white wine. Sauer Kraut is cabbage cut into fine 
shreds, pickled in salt, and made to ferment in the barrel. To keep 
it well preserved, it must be kept in a cool and even temperature, 
and must be kept well pressed under the brine. It is an agreeable 
vegetable to be eaten with salted meats. 

SAUER KRAUT, HOW TO MAKE. 

No. 327. — Take a barrel and knock out the head. Then set it in 
a stationary, place half a foot from the ground, in a cool and even 
temperature. Bore a hole in the barrel, about two inches from the 
bottom, and put therein a wooden faucet with a strainer inside of 
the barrel. Now select as many cabbages as are needed to fill the 
barrel, using only the best, solid white sorts procurable. Trim off 
the green leaves and cut out the stalks, then cut the cabbage into 
fine, short shreds, using a slide-board which has three or four 
knives, which are made for such a purpose. Place the slide-board 
over a wooden tub to receive the cabbage when it is cut up. Put a 
layer of salt in the bottom of the barrel, and then a layer of cabbage 
two inches thick. Add salt again, then cabbage, and thus alternate 
until the barrel is full. To every thirty pounds of cabbage use one 
and a half pounds of fine salt. 

Note. — A few bay leaves, carraway or anise seed, may be added with the layers of cabbage, but 
should be used only with moderation. 

When the barrel is full, cover the top with a layer of cabbage 
leaves, and spread a linen cloth over this, placing on top of the 
cloth a wooden cover, made to go inside the barrel, and on this 
cover place some heavy weight that will press the cover down very 
tight. Five days after let the brine run off and add the same quan- 
tity of fresh brine, changing it once every sixth day until the brine 
has been changed four times, or until the brine runs clear and 
without odor. To keep Kraut from moulding, the brine must always 
cover the cabbage. Two months after the Kraut is first put in the 
barrel it will be ready for use. Care must be taken to always keep 
the Kraut covered after any of it has been taken from the barrel for 
use.

No. 357. — There are two kinds of Cardoons — the Spanish and the 
ordinary — of which there are several species — which are cultivated 
for the stems and midribs. The Spanish variety is preferred, as 
the stems are thicker than the ordinary, the latter having the

flavor of artichokes. It is a vegetable much esteemed in Europe, 
though seldom used in this country, but it is becoming popular here. 
The flowers are gathered and dried in the shade, and are used to 
coagulate milk. 

cultuee. 

No. 358. — Cardoon is grown for the midribs of the leaves, which 
require to be blanched the same as celery. When the plants are to 
remain, sow them early in spring, in drills three feet apart and an 
inch and a half deep. Then thin out the young plants to a foot 
apart in drills. 

LARGE SPANISH. 

No. 359. — The ribs are longer than in the ordinary Cardoon, and 
the whole plant is much stronger. It runs up to seed quicker than 
the other varietj". 

THE ORDINARY. 

No. 360. — This is of a shiny green color, the stems growing about 
five feet high. Its leaves are large and strong. 

ARTICHOKE LEAVED. 

No. 361. — This is remarkable for its strong growth and the tliick- 
ness of its midribs, which are almost solid. It is a tender and fine 
variety. 

LAEGE TOURS SOLID. 

No. 362. — The midribs are large and solid, yet tender and 
delicate. Notwithstanding the inconvenience arising on account of 
its numerous and rigid spines, it is considered one of the best varie- 
ties. 

CARDOONS WITH MARROW. 

No. 363. — Take six white and solid Cardoon stems (the hard and 
hollow ones are of no use) and cut them four inches in length. As 
you prepare them put them in a pan of cold water, acidulated. 
Have a saucepanful of boiling water on the fire, in which you will 
put the ]uice of five lemons. Put the pieces of Cardoon in this 
water and parboil them until you can peel off the outer surface 
easily. Take them ofi* of the fire to peel and trim them, adding 
sufiicient cold water to allow you to put your hand in the water. 
Then put the peeled Cardoons in fresh water and drain them on a 
napkin. Prepare a deep flat saucepan lined with fine slices of fat

Frencb CARROT. German 

Car rote. Moehre. 

No. 373. — The Carrot is a biennial root, somewhat hardy, and is 
one of the most healthful and nutritious of garden roots. It is 
extensively used as a vegeteble for the table, and for seasoning and 
garnitures. It contains a certain amount of sugar, which adds to 
its nutritious quality. There are several different varieties, all of 
which can be obtained all the year round. The larger varieties are 
also cultivated as an agricultural root, and are better suited than 
other kinds of food for dairy cattle, not alone because they are 
nutritious, but because they impart a good color and flavor to the 
butter. 

CULTUKE. 

No. 374. — The Carrot succeeds best in light, sandy loam, made 
rich by manuring the previous year. The roots often grow pronged 
and ill-shaped, in imperfectly manured ground. It is better to sow 
as early in spring as the ground can be got ready, but if planting is 
necessarily delayed until late in the season, the seed must be soaked 
in tepid water twenty-four hours, then dry it by mixing in sifted 
ashes, and sow it in fully prepared soil. 

EAELY EKENCH FOKCING. 

No. 375. — This is the earliest variety, is valuable for forcing, and 
has a small root of fine flavor. 

EAELY SCARLET HORN. 

No. 376. — An old and favorite variety, much esteemed for sum- 
mer use. 

HALF LONG RED (STUNTED EGOTS). 

No. 377. — A variety intermediate in size, with stunted roots. Its 
period of maturity is between the Early Scarlet Horn and the Long 
Orange. 

HALF LONG SCARLET (POINTED EOOTS). 

No. 378. — -This is similar to the Half Long Eed with stunted 
roots, except that the roots are pointed. 



84: HAEDEE S AMERICAN COOKEEY. 

EAELY HALF LONG SCAELET CAEENTON. 

No. 379. — An early variety without core, and is excellent for 
forcing, or is used as an early kind for planting in the open ground. 

LONG OEANGE. 

No. 380. — It is adapted for garden or farm culture, and has large- 
sized roots. 

^ DANVEES. 

No. 381. — This is a valuable variety having the smallest root of 
any kind grown, but it will yield the greatest bulk. Its color is a 
rich shade of orange and it grows very smooth and handsome. 

ALTEINGHAM. 

No. 382. — An excellent variety, large and finely iiavored. 

LAEGE WHITE BELGIAN. 

No. 383. — A very productive variety, but grown almost exclusive- 
ly for stock. 

YELLOW BELGIAN. 

No. 384. — When young, the roots are mild, delicate and of good 
flavor; when full grown, it is only valuable for stock. 

HOW TO PEEPAEE CAEEOTS EOE COOKING. 

No. 385. — Carrots should always be scraped, and should only be 
prepared when ready for use. When young use them as a vegeta- 
ble, and prefer those that are stunt rooted. Cook them whole, or 
cut them in small parts. The large carrots are cut in different 
shapes, with spoon cutters, for garnitures, but when used as a veg- 
etable, cut them in a short, thick Julienne. When used for Julienne 
soup, cut them two inches crosswise; then slice them, and cut them 
lengthwise in small stems. When they get older, use only the red 
part, which you peel off by cutting it the same thickness. In this 
way the pieces will stay whole, but in the other way the pieces will 
break off when cooked.

FrcKcli CAULIFLOWER German 

Ohoufleur. Blumen Kohl. 

No. 409,— The Cauliflower, like Brocoli, is an annual plant, being 
delicious in flavor. It requires a cool, moist atmosphere to bring 
it to perfection, and if this condition occurs when the plant is about 
to head, fine large heads will result, whereas, if the air is hot and 
dry, failure will result in spite of the best of seeds and cultivation. 
Brocoli is a species of Cauliflower, and both are prepared in the 
same style. See Brocoli, Article XXIII. 

CULTURE. 

No. 410. — For the spring or summer crop, sow the early varieties, 
about the last of winter, in hot-beds, and transplant them into the 
open air as soon as the ground can be worked. For the late autumn 
crop, sow the late varieties about the middle of spring, and trans- 
plant them as you would winter cabbages. In dry weather water 
them freely, and as they advance in growth hoe deep and draw 
earth to the stems. After they begin to head they should be watered 
every other day. In two or three weeks the strongest will begin to 
form flower heads, which should be cut for use while the curd is close 
and compact. It is then tender and delicious, but later on the head 
opens and separates into branches and soon becomes coarse, fibrous, 
strongly flavored, and unfit for use. The leaves should be gathered 
and tied loosely over the tops of the heads to facilitate blanching. 
On the approach of frost, those plants that have not headed may 
be set out in a cellar and can be aired in mild weather. 

EARLY SNOWBALL. 

No. 411. — This is the earliest of all Cauliflowers. Its heads 
measure from 8 to 9 inches in diameter. Every plant forms a fine 
head. Its dwarf habit and short interleaves allow it to be planted 
as close as 18 inches apart each way. This variety does equally 
well for late planting.

then bake in an oven. 

CAULIFLOWER FRIED, VILLEROI. 

No. 424. — Cook the Cauliflowers the same as in No. 421. After 
you drain them, cut off the flowered heads in small bunches and dip 
them in Yilleroi sauce. Set them in a cool place, so the sauce will 
adhere to the Cauliflower. Then bread them with fresh bread 
crumbs. After this, dip them in beaten eggs and bread them again. 
Fry them in hot lard, until nicely browned, and serve them on a 
napkin, with fried parsley as a garniture. 

CAULIFLOWER FRIED IN BATTER.

some finely chopped parsley and chives, and cover them to macerate 
for two hours. Then place them on a towel to absorb all the 
moisture, and afterwards dip them in a light batter and fry them in 
hot lard to a nice brown color.

Celeri Have. Knol Selleri. 

No. 434. — This variety has a brownish, irregular root, at the base 
of the leaves near the surface of the ground. It is much hardier 
than the common variety of celery. Those required for winter use 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE. 95- 

should be drawn, packed in sand, and stored in tlie cellar before 
severe weather sets in. It is used in the same manner as the 
common celery. Its root, or bulb, is the only part eaten. Its llesh 
is white and tender, having the flavor of the sialics of common 
celery, though less mild and delicate. The leaf -stalk is used most 
for flavoring soups, and the bulbs are stewed or used in salad the 
same as celery. 

CULTUEE. 

No. 435. — Sow it early in spring, in light, rich soil, and transplant 
it in May into beds, and water it freely in dry weather. When the 
plants are almost full grown, it is customary to earth up the bulbs 
to the height of four or five inches. In about a month they will be 
sufficiently blanched for use. The roots, which resemble turnips, 
will be ready in October, and may be preserved in sand during 
winter. It is a vegetable that is much esteemed for culinary pur- 
poses. 

LARGE ERFURT. 

No. 436. — This is a variety of Celeriac, having turnip-shaped, 
roots, which may be cooked and sliced, and used with vinegar, to 
make an excellent salad. It is more hardy, and may be used in tlie 
same manner as celery. 

APPLE-SHAPED. 

No. 437. — This is a great improvement over the old variety,, 
having small foliage, and large, round and smooth tubers. 

CELERIAC FRIED, VILLEROI. 

No. 438. — Pare and then wash six Celeriac roots in cold water 
and cut them in quarters. Take off the hard part, trim them 
in scallops, parboil them for 15 minutes, and drain them. Then 
put them in a flat sancepan liiied with slices of fat pork and moisten 
them with white broth. Season with salt, pepper, nutmeg and a 
pinch of sugar. Then cover them with thin slices of fat pork, put 
them on the fire and let them cook slowly. When cooked take out 
the Celeriac and dry them on a napkin. Then strain the gravy in 
another saucepan and add four spoonfuls of AUemande sauce. Ee- 
duce it on a brisk fire and when cool dip the Celeriac in the sauce. 
Then arrange them in a pan and set them in a cool place, and when 
they are cold and the sauce adheres to the Celeriac, bread them m 
fresh bread crumbs. Then dip them in beaten eggs and bread them 
again. Fry them in hot lard and serve on a dish having a puree 
of Celeriac in the center.

Celeri. Selleri^ 

No. 448. — Celery is a hardy, umbelliferous biennial plant, and is 
always propagated from seed. The stems of the leaves are the parts 
of the plant that are used. These, after being blanched, are exceed- 
ingly crisp and tender, having an agreeable and peculiar aromatic 
flavor. They are prepared in various ways, but are generally served 
raw, for a relish, with salt or with oil, vinegar and mustard sauce. 
They are almost indispensable for salads.

ya HAEDEE S AMEEICAN COOKEEY. 

CULTUEE. 

No. 449. — Sow the seed in shallow boxes, or in a finely prepared 
bed out of doors, in straight rows, so that the small plants may be 
kept free from weeds. When about two inches high, thin them out 
and transplant them so they will stand two inches apart. When 
the J are about four inches high cut off the tops, which will cause 
them to grow stocky. The crop is usually an early one, and if good 
plants are used, they may be set out as late as the middle of August. 
The best results, however, are obtained by setting them out in the 
middle of June or the first of July. When setting them out, prepare 
broad, shallow trenches, about six inches deep and four feet apart, 
in which the plants should be set six inches apart. Cut off the 
outer leaves and press the soil firmly about the roots. In about six 
weeks the plants should be handled, which is done by having one 
man gather the leaves together while a second man draws the earth 
about the plant to one-third of its height, being careful that none 
of the earth falls between the leaves, as that would cause them to 
rust or rot. In a few days draw more earth around them, and repeat 
this process every few days until only the tops of the leaves are 
visible. In a few days more it will be fit for nse. Do not disturb 
the plants when the ground is wet, as that will injure them. 

At the approach of severe, freezing weather, take up the plants 
and put them in a light cellar or an unused frame, where the tem- 
perature can be kept above the freezing point. Set them out 
compactly, so that all but the tops of the leaves can be covered with 
sand. They will then gradually blanch, and may be used throughout 
the winter.

garnitures. As a garniture for salad borders use it as follows: 
Trim all of the green leaves from the bottom of a head of celery, 
and cut it in pieces two inches long. Then slice it thin and cut the 
broad stems an inch deep, without detaching them. Then lay them 
in cold water for an hour, and they will be nicely frizzled. That is, 
the little shreds will be curled. When using Celery for the 
center of a salad, take the heart of the Celery and slice it thin 
a few inches from the top, and lay the pieces in cold water for an 
hour, when it will be nicely frizzled. This makes an attractive 
garniture over the salad. 

CELERY PUREE, FOR GARNITURE.

French CENTAURY. German 

Centaur e'e. Tausendguldenh-aut. 

No. 481. — This is a small annual herbaceous plant, which grows 
wild. It is about a foot high, having a branching stem which 
divides above into pairs, and bears oval, smooth pointed leaves, 
direct from the stem. The flowers are rose colored. The herb has 
no odor, but has a strong bitter taste, and its tonic properties are 
similar to those of gentian. It is used in cases of dyspepsia and 
fever. The roots make a valuable yellow dye. The flowers are 
gathered in bunches, hung in a dark, airy, warm room, and when 
thoroughly dried are kept in boxes, in a dry place. TlXiey are used 
in diet drinks (tisanes), see Article LXXXII.

CHAMOMILE. 

Camomille. Ca7norinle. 

No. 432. — The single and double flowering Chamomile are propa- 
gated by slips, with a few of the small roots attached, both kinds 
being claimed as hardy perennials. In the Northern States the 
plants are frequently destroyed by severe frost. The single Chamo- 
mile, though considered more efflcacious for medicinal purposes, is 
not cultivated as much as the double flowering variety. They may 
be grown from leaves or slips. The leaves, when cut fine and 
burned, emit a peculiar, pungent odor. The flowers, which are the 
parts generally used, are in high repute, both in the popular and 
scientific materia medica, and give out their properties by infusion in 
either water or alcohol. The flowers are also used in the manufac- 
ture of bitter beer, and along with wormwood are used to a certain 
extent as a substitute for hops. It is considered a safe bitter and 
tonic, thoQgh strong infusions, when taken warm, act sometimes as 
an emetic. 

CULTURE. 

No. 483. — Chamomile flourishes best in light poor soil, and is 
generally propagated by dividing the roots and setting them in rows 
that are a foot apart with the plants ten inches from each other. 
They grow fast and soon entirely cover the ground.

COCOA. 

Coco ou Cocoa. Cacao. 

No. 515. — Cocoa is the fruit of the Cocoa tree, which grows in 
abundance in South America. The tree is about the size of a 
chestnut tree, and produces ribbed pods, which contain from 25 to 
50 seeds, which resemble ground almonds, and are covered with a 
dry pelicule. They have a bitter taste. There are several different 
varieties, namely, those of Caracas, of Ceylon, of Berbiche, of Saint 
Madelaine, and of Saint Domingo islands. They all differ in size 
and flavor. The best are those from Caracas, being lightly flattened 
and resembling our broad beans. The next best are those from 
St. Madelaine and Berbiche. It is less flattened than the Caracas 
variety, and its pelicule is covered with a fine, ash-colored powder. 
The other varieties are much more bitter and oily, and are mostly 



Ill Hardee's American cookery. 

used to make the Cocoa Butter. The germ of the Cocoa is always 
at the thick end, while in our almonds it is at the small end. The 
Cocoa of Caracas, St. Madelaine and Berbiche, mixed in equal 
quantities, makes the best quality of chocolate. This mixture gives 
an unctuous, oleaginous matter whicli chocolate should always 
possess. If chocolate is made simply from the Caracas Cocoa it 
will be too dry, while that made from the others alone would be too 
oily and bitter. Hence, the combination mentioned is necessary. 
After the Caracas beans are picked they are buried in the ground 
for four or six weeks, which causes them to lose some of their 
bitter taste. Care must be taken or they will have an exceedingly 
moisty flavor. The Caracas Cocoa, mixed with the others, always 
makes the best chocolate. 

The cocoa, broma and chocolate we drink are made from Cocoa. 
When made into chocolate, it is ground into a paste and mixed with 
sugar, etc. There are several grades, some for eating, some for 
candies and creams, and some for beverages. Cocoa and broma are 
more healthful as a breakfast beverage than chocolate, as the latter 
is too rich. 

GROUND COCOA. 

No. 516. — Dilute two table-spoonfuls of ground Cocoa, with two 
spoonfuls of water. Then put it in a small saucepan and moisten it 
with three cupfuls of boiling milk or water. Stir it well and let it 
boil five minutes. Then sweeten it to taste. 

SHELL COCOA. 

No. 517. — Put two ounces of half-broken Cocoa in a saucepan 
with one quart of boiling water. Let it boil slowh^ for half an 
hour, or until half of the moisture is reduced. Add a little milk if 
desired and sweeten to taste. This is preferred by people whose 
stomachs are delicate.

No. 518. — This is made the same as Cocoa. 

CHOCA. 

No. 519. — Take a cup of chocolate, a cup of coffee and a cup of

THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE. 115 

water, stirring it until it is melted. Then add two cupfuls of hot 
boiled milk. Sweeten to taste. As soon as it commences to boil, 
take it otf of the fire and serve. 

POT CHOCOLATE. 

No. 521. — The best Chocolate is made in a pot expressly made 
for this purpose, in which there is a silver whisk. Put four cup- 
fuls of milk or water in a chocolate pot. (Or put one ounce of 
Chocolate to one cup of milk.) When the milk boils add the fine 
grated Chocolate. When the Chocolate is melted and well mixed, 
set it on the side of the fire for ten minutes to keep warm. Then 
take the whisk between the palms of both hands and make it revolve 
backwards and forwards briskly until the Chocolate is whipped to a 
froth. Then serve. 

CHOCOLATE, WITH EGGS OR CREAM. 

No. 522. — Grate four ounces of Chocolate, and put it in a saucepan 
with four soup-spoonfuls of boiling water, and stir it until it is 
melted. AVhile stirring it, add in slowly five cupfuls of boiling 
milk. Let it boil up once, then sweeten it to taste, and set it on 
the side of the fire to keep warm. Have ready the whites of four 
eggs, whipped to a stiff froth. Add half of this quantity to the 
Chocolate, mixing it well. Sweeten the remaining half of the eggs 
with powdered sugar. Serve the Chocolate in cups, with a spoonful 
of the sweetened egg froth on top. 

jSfoTE.— Chocolate can be made as above, with cream instead of eggs. Add the cream when the 
Chocolate is ready to serve, having it whipped to a froth and flavored with vanilla. 

Stir it well when you put it in, so the hot Chocolate will warm it, 
without letting it boil. 

Note.— Chocolate can be made with water or milk, or with both, mixed in equal quantities. This 
is merely a matter of taste, as some prefer it with water and others with milk or cream. When 
sweetened Chocolate is used, no sugar, or very little, should be added, as the delicate flavor is des- 
troyed when too sweet. Sweeten plain Chocolate to taste. Never keep Chocolate on the fire boiling. 

ADULTERATED CHOCOLATE. 

No. 523. — Chocolate is often adulterated by unprincipled manu- 
facturers, which makes it a most vile compound instead of the 
nutritious beverage intended. They use small, common Cocoa, first 
extracting the Cocoa butter, and then mis with the remaining Cocoa 
a quantity of grilled sweet almonds. They also use the refuse of 
coarse brown sugar in place of pure sugar, and as a substitute for 
vanilla they use common storax, which is the sawdust of the Tonqua

tree; but persons experienced in Havor will detect the difference 
immediately. Impure Chocolate is also adulterated with butter, 
potato llour, starch, and other heterogeneous substances.

Freucli COFFEE. t;erman 

Cafe. Kaffee. 

No. 524. — Coffee is produced on a small bushy tree. The flowers 
are odorous, and the fruit jelly-like, having two seeds. Coffee is 
said to have originated in Arabia, but is now cultivated in different 
parts of the world. The Arabian historian, Ahmet Effendi, wrote 
that Coffee was first used in Arabia in the fifteenth century. The 
Egyptians prepare a drink with Coffee which the Arabs call Kawa. 
Coffee was introduced in France by the Venetians in 1657, after 
which its use became universal. There are five principal varieties 
of Coffee. The Mocha is considered the best, and is divided in 
three classes — namely, the Baouri, which is the best and is hardly 
ever obtainable in this country, as it is reserved for the highest 
classes in Arabia and Turkey; the Saki and the Salabi. The Coffee 
from Martinique, Java, Eio and Guadaloupe, is considered next best 
in quality. The grades from Santa Domingo, Costa Rica, and all 
other kinds, are of inferior qu ility. Coffee is now in use all over 
the civilized world, and is largely adulterated with the chiccory 
root, especially when ground. For this reason Coffee should always 
be procured in beans and ground when required. It will keep its 
flavor better in this wa3^ Adulterated Coffee was first used in 1808, 
during the campaign of Napoleon. The dealers, seeing the large 
profit that could be made by combining chiccory with Coffee, 
adopted it, and even claimed that chiccory improved Coffee, which 
is not so. Most of the ground Coffee now prepared and sold by 
unscrupulous dealers is adulterated with chiccory, ground peas and 
common Coffee beans. Coffee beans are roasted in Coffee roasters 
that can be purchased from dealers. It is better to buy Coffee 
beans in their green state as their quality can then be better distin- 
guished than when roasted. The interior of the Coffee roaster is 
round, and the beans when being turned in the receptacle will roll 
over and over, and thus get evenly roasted on the surface of the hot 
roller. Commence to roast the Coffee over a slow fire, so it will be 
gradually and thoroughly browned, which will take place in about 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE, 117 

forty-five minutes. Wlieu it is browned take it out of tlie roaster 
and spread it on a blanket. It will then emit an agreeable odor. 
Turn it occasionally to cool itj and when cold put it in jars corked 
tight and grind it when needed. The Mocha Coffee has the best 
flavor, and is generally mixed with Java or Rio. This makes the 
best black Coftee. The Coffee from Martinique and Costa Rica, 
when mixed, is the best to use when milk is added. Coffee when 
ground is made by infusion. French and American coffee pots are 
so well known that no description of them is necessary. Either can 
be used. Coffee should always be made fresh, and care should be 
taken to have the water to the boiling point before it is poured over 
the (Joffee. Coffee should not remain long in tin pots, as it 
contains an ingredient that combines with tin or iron, and imparts a 
disagreeable flavor when it lays for any length of time. For this 
reason when large quantities are made at a time it should be kept in 
earthen jars. When Coffee is left over, after a meal, always put it 
in an earthen jar to use the following day. 

Coffee is now made as it was years ago. The Orientals do not 
strain it. They boil it with the sugar in and serve it in cups, sus- 
pended below a punctured shell, called fitzyanes. Coffee made and 
served in this manner does not excite the nerves as -when made in the 
French or American styles, but the latter modes are considered the 
best. When using a French coffee pot the boiling water has to 
drain through the ground Coffee and runs clear immediately. 
Hence it is unnecessary to clarify it. When it is boiled in a sauce- 
pan and clarified with eggs or other substances, it loses much of its 
strength and flavor. Some physicians advance the theory that 
Coffee is injurious to health, but this is a fallacy, when it is used in 
moderation. A certain gourmet of advanced years, yet in robust 
health, was in the habit of imbibing a cup of Coffee after every 
meal. One evening while at dinner in the Palace Hotel with his 
friend, a well-known physician, the latter remarked casually that 
Coffee was a slow poison, and urged the gourmet to discontinue its 
use. 

"Well," remarked the gourmet, with a sly twinkle in his eye, 
" I agree with you on that point, but I must say that it is terrible 
slow, for I have been using it continuously for the past seventy 
years, and am still alive and well." The doctor then subsided. 

REMARKS ON MIXING COFFEE. 

No. 525. — Coffee is easy to make, but must be made with care. 
The principal point is not to have your Coffee beans ground or 
roasted too long before using, and to always use good Coffee. To 
one pound of Mocha add two pounds of Java, or use one pound 



118 HAEDER'S AMERICAN COOKERY. 

of Moclia, one pound of Java, and one pound of Costa Rica or Kio. 
These mixtures make the best Coffee. Coffee is made best in the 
so-called French coffee pots, which are made for large or small 
quantities. When boiling Coffee, the aroma evaporates to a con- 
siderable extent, which does not occur in French c )ffee pots. 
Ground Coffee should never be boiled when it can be done other- 
wise. Always use boiled milk or warm cream with Coffee, as cold 
milk injures the taste of the Coffee. Black Coffee, or co.fe noir, 
is always taken after dinner, and should be made stronger than 
breakfast Coffee. It is served with brandy, kirschwasser or rum, 
which is put in the Coffee, or first burnt with sugar, as may be 
desired. It is called brulo. It facilitates digestion and excites the 
faculties of the mind. 

COFFEE FOR FAMILY USE. 

No. 526. — To make ordinary breakfast Coffee, use four ounces of 
ground Coffee to one quart of boiling water. When using the French 
coffee pot, put the Coffee in the upper vessel Avith the strainer over 
it. Pour a little of the boiling Avater over it slowly, and in five 
minutes pour over the rest of the water until it is all in the bottom. 
Keep the pot in a warm place, not letting the Coffee boil. Take 
about three cupfuls of the Coffee out of the bottom and strain it 
through the top again. Repeat this once more, as it makes the 
Coffee stronger and then it will be ready for use. 

When making Black Coffee for after dinner, use more Coffee or 
less water to make it strong. 

BOILED COFFEE, No. 1. 

No. 527. — 'When no French coffee pot is used, the Coffee must be 
boiled in a saucepan and strained through a double thickness of 
flannel. When making Coffee in large quantities in a saucepan, put 
five pounds of ground Coffee in a saucepan, two fresh raw eggs, and 
a cupful of cold water. Mix it all well together with a wooden 
spoon, and then pour in, slowly at first, five gallons of boiling 
water, stirring it at the same time. Then set it on a brisk fire, and 
as the Coffee rises to the top press it down with a spoon. Let it 
boil up once, and then set it on the side of the fire to keep warm, 
not letting it boil. Drop half a cupful of cold water over the top, 
in drops, and the Coffee will settle immediately. Do this, if in a 
hurry, otherwise it will settle naturally in five or ten minutes. 
Strain it all through a double thickness of flannel, and it is ready 
for use.

BOILED COFFEE, No 2. 

No. 528. — When using a boiler (in which there is a faucet three 
inches from the bottom, with a fine strainer inside ), and the Coffee 
is made as in No. 1, it need not be strained through flanneh Set 
it on the side of the fire to keep the Coffee warm, and put a piece 
of iron under the boil-r to keep it a distance away from tJie fire. 
Then sprinkle half a cupful of cold water over the top, put the

No. 537. — This small salad is used during winter and spring as a 
substitute for lettuce. It is also prepared and cooked the same as 
spinach. The Corn Salad- that grows natural is better than that 
which is cultivated. It is used in salads, and when mixed with 
beets and celery it improves it as a breakfast salad. 



CULTUEE. 

No. 538. — Sow the seed during August or September, in shallow 
drills about one foot aJDart. If the soil is dry it should be pressed 
firmly over the seed in order to secure prompt germination. Cover 
them with straw upon the approach of severely cold weather. The 
plants will also do well if grown in spring, and, like most salad 
plants, are greatly improved if grown in very rich soil. The 
ground can scarcely be made too rich for them. In warm weather 
the plants will mature in from four to six weeks. 

COEN SALAD. 

No. 539. — Wash the Salad in plenty of cold water. Then drain 
it and put it on a salad dish and season it with salt, pepper, oil and 
vinegar. Parsley or chives, chopped fine, may bo added if desired. 

CORN SALAD, WITH BEETS. 

No. 540. — Prepare the Salad the same as in No. 539. Add some 
cold boiled sliced beets. Handle it carefully. This is a good 
breakfast Salad. 

CORN SALAD, WITH CELERY. 

No. 541. — Cut the celery in a small Julienne, and prepare as in 
No. 539. Endives or watercress can also be added.

kind-!, which are much used for breakfast, either boiled or fried. 
It is ground into meal (white and yellow), which is used for 
making bread and cakes. It is delicious when used as a mush with 
milk or cream. Corn starch is made from Corn, and is much 
used for custards, cream and various other pastry preparations.

No. 587. — Corn Meal is finely ground corn, it is also called Indian 
Meal. There are two kinds of Corn Meal, the white and the yelloAV. 
The best variety of white Corn Meal is made from Blunt' s prolific 
corn, and the best variety of the yellow is made from the Golden 
Dent variety. Mush is generally made from the latter kind. Corn 
Meal is also used for making a great variety of bread and cakes,

milk. Then add in, gently, tlae whites of the eggs (beaten to a stifit' 
froth), and bake. 

CORN STARCH. 

No. 598. — Corn Starch is the fecula of Corn, and is used for all 
the purposes for which arrow root is used in cooking. It is also 
much preferable to arrow root for alimentary purposes. It is used 
in creams, custards, blanc mange, and a numberless variety of cakes 
and fritters. It is also delicious for thickening certain soups and 
sauces, instead of flour, as it keeps them clear and transparent. 
Though many preparations made with Corn Starch are not as succu- 
lent as when made in their original styles, especially will this be 
found to be the case with creams, blanc mange, etc. It often 
happens that when articles are made of Corn Starch which are too 
stiff, or which are not well cooked, they retain a starchy taste. It 
is very nutritious for infants and invalids, when boiled in milk or 
made into custards. The recipes will be found in their respective 
places in the Books on Soups, Sauces and Pastries.

small also. It is a good variety, but not as profitable as the others. 

CULTURE. 

No. 604. — Procure the plants with their natural earth and plant 
them earl}- in spring, four feet apart, in moist sandy soil, well 
manured. 

CEANBEEEY SAUCE. 

No. 605. — Pick oiie pound of Cranberries and wash them in cold 
■water. Put them in a copper basin with a glassful of water and 
cook them over a brisk fire. Sweeten with sugar stirred in with a 
wooden spoon until they are like a marmalade. Then strain them 
through a fine sieve and put them in an earthen jar. The sauce is 
used with turkey and for tarts and pies. If Cranberries are cooked 
in tin basins they will not keep their rich red color.

JFrench CRESS, OR PEPPER GRASS. German 

Cress m. Pillenfarn. 

No. 606. — Cress, or Pepper Grass, is a pungent salad, and is 
mostly used in mixing with other salads. Mixed with fine herbs it 
has a piquant, agreeable taste, and it should always be used when 
young and freshly plucked. It gives a most agree ible taste to all 
green salads. 

CULTUEE. 

No. 607. — The seed should be sown in drills about eighteen inches 
apart on very rich ground, and the plants Avell cultivated. Keep off 
insects bs' dusting with Pyrethrum powder. It may be planted 
A^ery earl}^ Continue sowing every week, as it matures very 
rapidly and runs to seed. 

The fine curled Cress is very superior, and will bear cutting sev- 
eral times. The Perennial American resembles the water Cress, 
and may be cut several times. 

The Garden Broad Leaved has a mild flavor and is generally used 
in soups.

French GARDEN CRESS. German 

Cressun alenois de>< jardins. Kresse. 

No. 608. — This is one of the best pkints in cultivation for herbs, 
and can be easily raised in pots or boxes. It runs quickly into 
seed and withers as soon as plucked^ so for this reason it is rarely 
found in the markets. It is an excellent ingredient for salads, hav- 
ing a mild, piquant taste. The leaves should never be chopped, 
but are plucked or served in bunches. The leaves when laid 
between buttered sandwiches and eaten with eggs, make a relish 
highly esteemed by epicures. 



Article LXXV. 



WATER CRESS. 

Cresson de Funtaine. Brunnen- Kresse. 

No. 609. — The Water Cress is a hardy, perennial, aquatic plant, 
growing abundantly along the margins of running streams, ditches 
and ponds. It is very easily introduced by planting it along the 
margins of ponds and streams where it does not already grow, and 
will increase both by the spreading of the roots and seeding. 

It has a particularly pleasant, pungent taste, and is agreeable to 
nearly every one. It is also one of the most delicious small salads. 

CULTURE. 

No. 610. — The seeds should be sown and lightly covered in grav- 
elly, murky lands, along the border of small, rapid streams. They 
will need no subsequent culture, as in favorable conditions they 
increase very rapidly by self-sowing of seed and extension of roots. 
Good beds should be fenced in to keep animals from trampling on 
them, and should also be kept clear of wild herbs. 

ITS USE. 

No. 611. — It is eaten as a morning salad, and should only be used 
when fresh. It should be washed well in cold water and then 
drained. (Care must be taken not to bruise or press it.) Then 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE. 137 

add a little vinegar, salt and pepper. It is also mixed with other 
green salads, and is largely used for garnishing roast chickeas, 
steaks, etc. It can also be cooked and prepared the same as 
spinach.

FreKcH CUCUMBER. German 

Cuncombre, Gurke. 

No. 612. — There are many varieties of Cucnmbers. They are 
eaten raw and are also cooked in various ways. When used in salads 
they should be sliced very fine and sprinkled with salt to drain them 
of the water, otherwise they are apt to cause indigestion. It is a 
vegetable that can be grown to perfection by any one who controls 
a few square yards of soil which is fully exposed to the sun — the 
fruit being so very much better when gathered from the vine than 
when procured in the market. Rome varieties are used for cooking- 
purposes and some for pickling, and are then called pickles, or 
gherkins. 

CULTURE. 

No. 613. — The plants are tender, and planting should be delayed 
until settled warm weather or ample facilities are provided to pro- 
tect them from frost and during cold storms. Form low, flat hills, 
six feet apart each way, of rich soil, by mixing in a quantity of 
thoroughly decomposed manure, stirring the soil to a depth of 
sixteen inches or more. Scatter one seed every inch along the rows, 
and cover them one inch deep, pressing the soil over them. As 
soon as the plants are up they will be liable to attack by the striped 
cucumber beetle. These may be kept off by frequent dusting with 
air-slacked lime. Care should be taken not to use too much lime, 
for if too strong it will kill the vines. When the plants are well 
established, thin to three plants to each hill. In gathering, pick 
all the fruit before it begins to ripen, as the vines will cease setting 
fruit as soon as any seed commences to mature. In gathering for 
pickles cut the stem instead of pulling the fruit off, and be careful 
not to mar the fruit in any way, for if the skin is broken the pickles 
will not keep. 

EARLY WHITE SPINE.

No. 622. — These are almost exclusively raised for self-gratification, 
and are grown in hot-houses. Sow them in small pots in January, 
February or March, in a hot-bed or hot-house, and when grown to 
three leaves plant them out in previously prepared hills of loose 
rich soil in the center of fhe sash. Keep a temperature of sixty- 
five degrees at night, to seventy or eighty degrees with sun heat.

No. CM. — This is a hardy, perennial plant, that is grown in the 
Northern and Southern States. The stem is about fifteen inches 
high, being erect and smooth. The leaves are deeply divided and 
have a warm, pungent taste, such as is always noticeable in the 
Cress family. They are used when young as a salad, the same as 
other cresses. Medicinally it has the reputation of being highly 
anti-scorbutic, and it also aids digestion. There are four varieties : 
the white flowering, the purple flowering, the double white flower- 
ing, and the double purple flowering. The last two varieties are 
propagated by a division of the roots. The single varieties are 
propagated from seed, which is sown in April, in shallow drills, one 
foot apart. The roots may be divided in spring or autumn.

French DANDELION. Germau 

Pisse en lit. Lowenzahn. 

No. 647. — Those who only know the Dandelion as the persistent 
weed in pastures and lawns (which is gathered for salads when 
young and green), know no more of its real value than one who has 
only seen the poisonous wild parsnip or carrot knows of the value 
of those vegetables. The improved variety makes it one of the ear- 
liest and best greens in cultivation. It is a hardy perennial plant, 
resembling the endive, and affords one of the best and most health- 
ful of spring salads. 

" CULTUEE. 

No. 648. — When cultivated the seeds should be sown in May or 
June, in drills half an inch deep and twelve inches apart. The 
plants will be ready for use the following spring. It is also exten- 
sively grown for its roots. For this purpose it is sown in Septem- 
ber and cultivated well during the fall, and in the following season 
the roots will be fit to dig up in October. The roots, after being 
dried, constitute an article of commercial importance, being exten- 
sively employed as a substitute for, or mixed with coffee. 

LAEGE LEAVED DANDELION (CULTIVATED). 

No. 649. — When cultivated its leaves are fully double the size of 
the common Dandelion. It is a great improvement over the com- 
mon variety, and when blanched it can be prepared in every way, 
the same as the endive.

No. 654. — It is the duty of every chief cook to know how to com- 
pound and prepare diet drinks, juleps and apozems. Diet drinks, 
or tisanes, are made for sick persons, to be taken as a refreshment. 
They should be prepared in such a manner that the taste will be 
agreeable to the patient. In making diet drinks it is best to use 
earthen pots. They should not be allowed to draw more than half 
an hour or they will get too strong and bitter. When flowei-s, 
leaves or herbs are used, diet drinks are made by infusion; when 
roots are used, they are boiled.

CULTURE. 

No. 671. — Tlie seed germinates slowly and should be started in 
strong heat, for in this, as in all tropical plants, it is of import- 
ance to secure a rapid and continuous growth from the first, the 
plants never recovering from a check received when young. When 
the plants have formed two rough leaves, transplant them to four 
inches apart, keep the bed closed and very warm, shaded from the 
direct rays of the sun, and giving them an abundance of water until 
the ground is warm and all danger, not only from frost but from 
cold nights, is past. Then harden off the plants by gradual exposure 
to the sun and air, and decrease the supply of water. Then care- 
fully transplant them into warm, rich soil, setting the plants two 
and one-half feet apart. If needed shade the young plants and 
protect them from the potatoe bug, which is very fond of them, and 
if not prevented will soon destroy the young plants.

different varieties. The Wild Chicoree, known as the Dandelion, 
is mostly eaten in salad when young and tender. The cultivated 
Endive (broad leaf) is u^ed as a vegetable, and is prepared the 
same as spinach. 

CULTURE. 

No. 695. — It may be grown at any season of the year, but is 
generally used late in the fall. Sow the seed during June or July, 
in drills fourteen inches apart, and when well up thin the plants to 
one foot apart. When nearly full grown tie the outer leaves 
together over the centre, in order to blanch the heart of the plant. 
They will usually be fit for the table in ten days, and will continue 
in condition for use for about one week, so that the tieing up should 
be done every few days, in order to secure a succession.

in hot lard, and when nicely browned, drain them. After this, 
take off the small cover and scoop out the center, (taking care not 
to break the shell), and fill them with the following preparation: 

Put the yolks of five raw eggs in a saucepan, add a pinch of nut- 
meg, and dilute it all with half a pint of cream. Add to it one pound 
of grated Parmesan cheese. Set it on a moderate fire and stir it 
until the cheese is melted. (Do not let it boil.) It should have the 
consistency of a sauce. 

When filled, serve them hot. 

FARINA CRUSTS OR STANDS, OF CORN MEAL, FOR HOT OR COLD SIDE DISHES. 

No. 713. — These crusts or stands are made either with bread, 
rice or Farina. Those made with Farina are better than those with 
rice, for hot dishes, as they are not so heavy, and are better than 
those made with bread, as the Farina does not absorb the moisture 
as quick as the bread when they lay for any length of time. Cook 
the Farina in water, lightly salted, keeping it firm. When it is 
cooked put it in a buttered mould as near the size of the crust as 
possible, that you intend making. Smooth the surface, cover it 
with a buttered paper, cover and put on this a wooden cover with a 
weight on top to press the Farina down solid in the mould. Lay it 
aside to get cold and hard. Then take it out of the mould, and with 
a small sharp knife cut it into any shape desired. Dip it in beaten 
eggs and then in fresh bread crumbs or raspings of bread, and fry it 
in hot lard until nicely browned. Then drain it and keep it for use. 

FARINA TARTLETS OF CORN MEAL. 

No. 714. — Cook the Farina as in No. 710, and keep it firm. But- 
ter some small Tartlet moulds with clarified butter and set them in a 
cool place to let the butter get cold. Put the Farina into the 
moulds with a table knife, leaving a space in the center for filling. 
Fill the center with grated Parmesan cheese and smooth off the 
top. Then set them in a cool place, and when they are cold take 
them out of the moulds. Bread them in a mixture of half bread 
crumbs and lialf grated Parmesan cheese. Then dip them in beaten 
eggs and bread them again with the same mixture. Shape them 
well, then fry them in hot lard until nicely browned. Then drain 
them, dish them up on a napkin and serve them hot. 

FARINA QUENELLES, OR BALLS, OF CORN MEAL. 

No. 715. — These are made nearly the same as Tartlets, except 
that Gruyere cheese is used instead of Parmesan cheese. When

they are cold dip them in beaten eggs and fry them in hot lard. 
They may be used as a garniture or served the same as Tartlets. 

FRIED FARINA (POLENTA) OF CORN MEAL, RAMEQUIN. 

No. 716. — Cook one pound of Farina as in No. 710. When it is 
cooked take it off of the fire, add three ounces of butter divided 
into small pieces, and four ounces cf grated Parmesan cheese. 
Season it with salt, pepper, nutmeg and a pinch of sugar, and mix it 
well together. Moisten the pan slightly with cold water and drop a 
soup-spoonful of the Polenta into it so it will spread out a little, and 
continue doing this until the bottom of the pan is well covered, 
keeping each cake separate. Put some grated Parmesan cheese in 
the center of each, or a small piece of Gruyere cheese. Now cover 
each piece with a thin layer of the Polenta and set the pan aside, so 
the cakes will get cold. With a cutter about the size of a dollar 
cut out the cakes to a round shape. Take them out of the pan, dip 
them in beaten eggs and then in bread crumbs. Put a little clarified 
butter in a frying pan, and when it is warm add the Ramequin (not 
putting too many in the pan at a time), and fry them on both sides 
to a nice brown. Serve them on a napkin with fried parsley as a 
garniture. 

FARINA (polenta) FOR GARNITURES. 

No. 717. — When the Polenta is cooked as in No. 710, put it in 
small round buttered Charlotte moulds and keep them warm. Then 
turn them out and use them for large garnitures. They are espe- 
cially appropriate for Italian dinners. Those prepared as in Nos. 
713, 714, 715 and 716 can also be used as garnitures.

French SWEET FENNEL. Cei-maa 

Fenouil. Fenchel. 

N'o. 720. — Sweet Fennel is a hardy, perennial, aromatic plant, of 
which there are several varieties. The common, or bitter fennel, 
has strong, deep, fleshy roots, and the seeds have a broAvnish color 
and a bitter taste similar to the leaves. Sweet Fennel seeds are 
used by confectioners and distillers, and the leaves are used for 
flavoring soups and sauces. The seeds resemble anise seeds. 

CULTURE. 

No. 721.— Fennel is cultivated the same as anise. Italian Fennel 
is quite distinct from the common variety, and is cultivated 
annually. The flowers are produced in umbels, as in the other 
species. The seeds are yellowish in color, slender, slightly curved, 
and have a pleasant anise like taste. When the stems have attained 
a sufficient size, they should be earthed . up, the same as celery, to 
blanch. If properly treated the stems will be white, cri&p and 
tender in about three weeks. When blanched they lose their bitter 
taste and are excellent for salads, possessing a sweet, pleasant, 
aromatic taste, and may be served the same way as plain celery for 
a relish. ^ 

STEWED FENNEL. 

No. 722. — Wash the Fennel in plenty of cold water and trim off 
the hard leaves. Parboil them for five minutes, then immerse them 
in cold water, and trim them evenly. Then cook them the same as 
celery, in No. 462. Pour over them some Butter, AUemande or 
Espagnole sauce.

impart an agreeable aroma, and are purchased in liquid form. The 
best quality should always be procured. Aromatic herbs and plants 
are used in making coffee, tea, wine, juleps, and many other drinks. 
The concentrated essence of meat, game, fish, or veg.etables, when 
added to sauces and other culinary preparations gives a splendid 
flavor and is greatly relished- 

ESSENCE or VEGETABLES. 

No. 724. — Put in a saucepan four pounds of rump of beef, a 
shin of veal cut in pieces, one hen, ten carrots, eight onions, five 
turnips, two heads of lettuce, two heads of celery, a faggot of 
chervil, and half a dozen cloves. Pour one gallon of broth

grain, and has many grades and varieties. It is much used for 
alimentary purposes, and the best should always be procured. The 
flour used in making bread is of a different quality than that of 
which pastry is made. Flour when dried in the oven and lightly 
colored or cooked with butter to a light brown, gives a better flavor 
to sauces. It also makes a healthful soup and is more digestible 
than when used raw.

GARLIC. 

Ail. Knoblauch. 

No. 728. — Garlic is a bulbous rooted plant, having a strong, pen- 
etrating odor. The bulb is composed of many smaller bulbs called 
cloves. It is not popular with Americans, although used consid- 
erably in Europe and in the Southern States. It should be 
used with moderation, as the breath of persons who eat Garlic is 
very offensive. It is used in many preparations, but can be omitted 
and replaced by using shallots or onions, when desired. Garlic, 
when used in salad, should be rubbed on a crust of bread (called 
chapon). When used for stews, etc., and left whole, its flavor will 
not be strong and penetrating as when mashed or chopped, and 
gives the preparation an appetizing and agreeable taste, especially 
in mutton stews. 

CULTURE. 

No. 729. — Prepare the ground the same as for onions. Plant the 
bulbs in drills eight inches apart, and four inches apart in rows, 
and cover them two inches deep. When the leaves turn yellow, 
take up the bulbs and dry them as you would do with onions. 

GARLIC BUTTER OR GASCONY BUTTER. 

No. 730. — Boil one dozen cloves of Garlic for ten minutes. Then 
drain them and pound them in a mortar with half a pound of but- 
ter. Add a little nutmeg and a pinch of red pepper, and when well 
mixed, rub it through a fine sieve and keep it in a cool place.

Garlic flavor. Cut a crust of bread the size of half a dollar, rub it 
with the clove of Garlic and mix it in with the salad. 

PUREE OF GARLIC. 

No. 732. — Peel one dozen Garlic bulbs and parboil them in plenty 
of water lightly salted, until they are cooked. Then drain them 
and put them in a saucepan with a piece of butter. Set it on a 
brisk fire to reduce the moisture. Season with salt and a pinch of

are gathered and cleansed tliey are scalded in boiling water, to 
prevent germination, and are then rapidly dried. This is the ordinary 
*black ginger, most of which comes from Calcutta, and is called East 
India Ginger. In Jamaica another variety is prepared by selecting 
the best roots, depriving them of their epidermis and drying them 
carefully in the sun. This is the highly valued white Ginger, 
:generally called Jamaica Ginger. A preserve is made from Ginger 
by selecting the young roots, depriving them of their cortical 
covering and boiling them in syrup. This is imported from the 
East and West Indies, and from China. When good it is translucent 
and tender. The odor of Ginger is aromatic and penetrating, the 
taste spicy, pungent, hot, and biting. These properties gradually 
diminish and are ultimately lost by exposure. It is used by pastry 
cooks, and confectioners, in putting up spiced preserves and fruits. 
Pieces of Ginger that are light and friable, worm-eaten or very 
fibrous, should be rejected. Ginger is often adulterated with rice- 
starch, flour-ginger, brick dust, chalk, capsicum, and mustard. 
Ginger is a grateful stimulant and carminative, and is often given 
in dyspepsia, flatulent colic, and the feeble state of the alimentary 
canal attendant upon atonic gout.

cemented together, or form a collection of small scales which are 
more or less covered with a fine yellow powder called Lupalin. 
The plant is principally cultivated for its flowers, which are largely 
used by manufacturers of malt liquors. The young shoots are cut 
in the spring, and used for culinary purposes, when they are five 
or six inches high. They are eaten as a salad, or are prepared the 
same as asparagus, which they somewhat resemble in taste. They 
are recommended by physicians for persons having nervous debility. 

BOILED HOPS WITH SAUCE.

HORSE-RADISH. 

Rcdfort. Meerettig.- 

No. 755. — Horse-radish is a plant having a root of a pungent 
taste, which when grated is much used as a condiment. There are 
two varieties, the wild and the cultivated. The latter kind is the 
best, attaining a large brown colored root, the flesh of which is 
white. It has a burning spicy taste, and is used both raw and 
cooked. It is grated and served as a relish, or in sauces^ and is 
also very agreeable to eat with boiled beef. 

CULTUKE. 

No. 756. — The best method of growing Horse-radish is from the 
little roots, four or five inches in length, and not from the crowns. 
The small roots will produce good radish fit for use in one season's 
growth. Plant a set with the small end down, where the slanting cut 
is, and so that the top will be two inches under the soil. It can remain 
in the ground until very late in the autumn, and can be bedded, or a 
portion can remain in the ground until spring. A dozen roots will 
furnish all that will be needed for family use for a life time, as it 
constantly increases, and the only danger is that it will spread too 
fast and become troublesome. It is best, therefore, to plant it in 
some corner of the garden where it can grow without injuring other 
plants.

eties are the most tender and delicate, of any of the cabbage 
species. They are hardy, and improve when exposed to a light 
frost. 

CULTUEE. 

No. 771. — They may be sown as late as December in the North- 
ern States. They will grow out during the winter in the South, 
without protection, and are treated like the winter cabbages. If 
they are cut when slightly frozen, thaw them out in cold water 
before boiling them. 

TALL GEEEN CUELED SCOTCH. 

No. 772. — This is a hardy variety, which is improved by a mod- 
erate frost. It is about two feet high, wath an abundance of dai-k 
green curled leaves. It stands the winter in the Middle States 
withouit any protection. 

GEEMAN DWAEF, PUEPLE. 

No. 773. — This is a dwarf compact plant, composed of a mass of 
large, finely frilled leaves, of a deep purple color. It is tender and 
of excellent quality. 

GEEMAN DWAEF, GEEEN. 

No. 774. — This is a smooth leaved sort that is very popular in the 
South, where if sown in the fall it needs no protection, growing 
vigorously all the winter.* It is not equal to the other varieties for 
use in the North.

trench LAVENDER. German 

Lavavde. Lavendel. 

No. 779. — This is a hardy perennial, aromatic plant, common to 
the south of Europe. The flower yields an oil used in medicine 
and perfumery. The Spike-Lavender yields a coarser oil that is used 
in the arts and for the distillation of Lavender Water, or is dried and 
used to perfume linen. The flowers should be picked before they 
are fully expanded, and dried quickly. They are also distilled, and 
so is the oil from the flower, bearing its name.

LEEK. 

Poireau. Lauch. 

No. 780. — The Leek is a hardy biennial plant of the Onion family. 
It is, however, without a proper bulb, having, in the place of this 
a cylindrical body of succulent leaves, which are eatable. The 
small bulb is oblong and tunicated, the lower blanched portion 
being the part eaten. By some people it is preferred to the onion, 
when young. It is used principally for flavoring and as an ingre- 
dient in soups. 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE. 179 

CULTUEE. 

No. 781. — Dig the trendies eight inches deep and make the soil, 
at the bottom, rich and fine. Sow the seeds early in spring and 
cover them lightly with earth. Thin them to sis inches apart, and 
when the plants are twelve inches high gather the leaves together 
and fill the trench so as to blanch the lower part of the plants. 
Store them in the cellar or out of doors (as you would celery), 
before severe weather commences. 

LONDON FLAG. 

No. 782. — This variety is more generally cultivated in this country 
than in any other. It is hardy and of good quality. 

LITTLE MONTAGNE. 

No. 783. — This is one of the smallest of the Leek species. The 
stems are short and slender. 

PROLIFEROUS LEEK. 

No. 784. — This is a vigorous variety of the common Leek. The 
bulb will remain sound several weeks after they have ripened. 

YELLOW POITON. 

No. 785. — The blanched portion of the stem is of a yellowish 
white color, and is more tender than that of any other variety, and 
of a remarkably large size. 

LARGE ROUEN. 

No. 786. — The stem is rather short, with very thick dark green 
leaves. It is considered one of the good kinds. 

SOUP PUREE OF LEEKS, VIENNOISE. 

No. 787. — Slice fine the white part of one dozen good sized 
Leeks, and put them into a saucepan, with a piece of butter. Frv 
them lightly (not long enough to get browned), and then add one 
or two quarts of broth. When they are well cooked add three 
quarts of thickened chicken or veal broth. Season with salt, 
pepper, nutmeg, and a pinch of sugar, and add a faggot of parsley 
garnished. Let it cook slowly for twenty-five minutes. Then take 
out the faggot, skim off the grease, rub the soup through a fine

French LENTIL, OR LENS. German 

Lentilles. LinbC. 

No. 788. — This is a hardy annual plant, with an erect and angu- 
lar branching stem, one foot and a half high. The pods are some- 
what quadrangular, and enclose one or two lens-like seeds, the size 
and color varying in different varieties. The Lentil is a vegetable 
of the greatest antiquity, and was much esteemed in olden times by 
those making long journeys. The seeds are used and prepared the 
same as beans, and for soups and purees, they are prepared the 
same as dried peas. 

CULTURE. 

No. 789. — Sow the seeds in May, in drills the same as green peas. 
They succeed best in dry, warm, light soil. 

COMMON LENTIL. 

No. 790. — -This variety is considered superior to the large LentiL 
The seeds are aiucli smaller and are greatly esteemed.

French LETTUCE. German 

Laitue. Latlichsalat. 

No. 800. — Lettuce is a hardy annual plant of Asiatic origin, and 
is always grown from seed. It may be had at all seasons of the 
year, but its quality is not always the same. There is no vegetable 
more generally used than Lettuce, yet few people know how appe- 
tizing it is when brought to the table fresh and in an unwilted con- 
dition. It ranks as one of the best green salads, and is much used 
with chicken and other salads. Lettuce is also used as a vegetable 
prepared the same as spinach, and when stuffed, and is used as a 
garniture for soups and meats. There are a number of varieties of 
Lettuce. 

CULTURE. 

No. 801. — The quality of Lettuce depends largely upon rapid and 
vigorous growth, and to secure that we need very rich, mellow soil, 
frequent surface cultivation, and an abundant supply of water. 
Por the earliest crop sow the seed under glass, in March, and thin 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OP TASTE. 183 

out the plants to prevent crowding. If you intend to mature tlie 
plants under glass, keep the beds quite close, and water it frequently 
and abundantly with liquid manure, and keep it well shaded during 
sunny days. If the plants are to be set in the open ground, give 
them all the air possible, without freezing them, and harden them 
off by full exposure and the withdrawal of water before transplanting. 
The plants should be set out as soon as a warm spot can be made 
very rich and mellow. When they are set out, sow the seeds in 
drills, fourteen inches apart, and thin them out, as wanted for the 
table, until they stand eighteen inches apart. Hoe them frequently, 
and water them when dry. The Cos varieties should be tied up 
about ten days before using, in order to blanch the inner leaves. 

EARLY TENNIS BALL. 

No. 802. — This is the best variety of head Lettuce for growing 
under glass, being very hardy and having thick, crisp, and tender 
leaves. It forms a compact head under glass, but when in the open 
air, unless planted very early, it is liable to be loose and open. 

BLACK SEEDED SIMPSON. 

No. 803. — The leaves of this variety are very large and form a 
compact mass, rather than a distinct head. They are of superior 
quality, being thin and tender, and of a light green color. Their 
color prevents any wilting of the plant being noticed, and as a 
consequence, it is a popular market variety. 

SIMPSON EARLY CURLED. 

No. 804. — This is one of the best early varieties for family use. 
All of the leaves tend to produce a large loose head. The leaves 
are dark green, beautifully crimped, and are tender and crisp. 

EARLY BOSTON CURLED. 

No. 805. — This variety has numerous large dark green leaves, 
that grow close together, the edges being deeply frilled, so that the 
whole plant forms around mass, closely resembling a bunch of moss. 

EARLY PRIZE HEAD (feRRY's). 

No. 806. — This is the best Lettuce known. It forms a mammoth 
hardy plant, of which even the outer leaves are crisp and tender, 



"184 haeder's ameeican cookery. 

"remaining so througliout the season. It is slow to run up to seed. 
-Its flavor is delicious, and it is much used in soups, etc. 

HANSON. 

No. 807. — This is a very fine heading variety, of large size, and 
stands the sun better than any other sort. The heads are large, 
solid, sweet, tender, and crisp throughout, and are devoid of any 
bitter taste. 

DEACON. 

No. 808. — This plant is small, having very thick and smooth dark 
green leaves, which are crisp and tender. 

EARLY CURLED SILESIA. 

No. 809. — An early variety of very strong growth, which does not 
form a head, but is the best kind for cutting and bunching when 
young. The leaves are large and wrinkled and of a light 3^ellow 
color. It resembles the Cos varieties in quality. 

FEANKFOET HEAD. 

No. 810. — A dark green curled variety with close round heads, 
which when opened are finely blanched and very crisp. It remains 



in head a long time. 



LAEGE DEUMHEAD. 



No. 811. — The head is remarkably large and compact, though 
somewhat flattened. It is crisp and tender and one of the finest 
summer varieties. Its color is pale green without and white in the 
center. 



PHILADELPHIA BUTTEE. 

No. 812. — This is a very early variety, desirable for forcing and 
ior early planting out of doors, but it does not stand the sun well. 
It is medium in size, having a compact head, the leaves being 
smooth and thick and of a bluish-green color. 

BROWN DUTCH. 

No. 813. — This is an old and hardy, variety, and always forms a 
large, solid head, which is somewhat coarse looking. The leaves 
are large and thick, of a deejD green color outside, but beautifully 
blanched within. They are exceedingly sweet, tender, and of good 
flavor. 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE. 185 

GREEN FRINGED. 

No. 814. — All ornamental variety of exceeding beaut}", but 
inferior in quality. The inside of the leaves is white, the edges a 
light green, delicately fringed and crimped. Its handsome 
appearance makes it well worthy of cultivation for table decoration 
alone. 

WHITE PARIS COS. 

No. 815. — This is a large hardy variety, which takes long in 
ranning to seed, and is considered by many to be far better than 
the other varieties. The heads are long and upright, with oblong 
leaves, that are tender, brittle, and highly flavored. 

SALAMANDER. 

No. 816. — This is the best variety for summer use, forming large, 
compact heads. It is light green in color outside, and white inside. 
Its great advantage is that it will stand drought and heat, and will 
remain longer in heads than the other varieties. 

LETTUCE BRAIZED, SPANISH STYLE. 

No. 817. — Select one dozen solid heads of Lettuce and trim off 
the outer leaves. Wash the Lettuce in plenty of cold water and 
then drain them. Parboil them for five minutes, then immerse 
them in cold water. After this press each head in the hand well, 
arrange them on a napkin and trim them. Next line a deep flat 
saucepan with thin slices of fat pork, on which you will put the 
heads of Lettuce side by side. Season with salt, pepper and nut- 
meg, and add a faggot of parsley garnished with two bay leaves, a 
sprig of thyme and two onions having three cloves stuck in each. 
Cover each head of Lettuce with slices of fat pork and moisten 
them with stock broth. Cover the saucepan and let this boil once 
and then set it on the side of the fire to cook slowly until done. 
Then drain them on a sieve and sponge off the grease with a nap- 
kin. Then put them in a saucepan with three spoonfuls of half 
glaze, and set them in the oven. When glazed serve them with a 
reduced Espagnole sauce. 

LETTUCE BRAIZED, GERMAN STYLE. 

No. 818. — Prepare the Lettuce as in No. 817, and when cooked 
drain them on a napkin and sponge off the grease. Then dish them 
up and pour over them some Allemande sauce, reduced with cream.

stuffed lettuce. 

No. 819. — Prepare one dozen heads of Lettuce as in No. 817, and 
when parboiled immerse them in cold water, then press them in 
the hands and dry them. Put them on a towel on the table, spread 
out the leaves of each head and season with salt, .pepper, and 
nutmeg. Add in the middle of each head some forced meat of veal 
(Godiveau) flavored with cooked fine herbs. Put the Lettuce in 
shape again, trim them and arrange them in a deep flat saucepan, 
lined with thin slices of fat pork. Moisten them with veal gravy, 
then let them boil, after which cover the saucepan and set it in the 
oven. Sprinkle them with the gravy occasionally, so they will glaze 
nicely. When cooked dish them up, strain off the gravy, take off 
the grease, and serve the gravy with them. 

LETTUCE STUFFED AND FRIED. 

No. 820. — Prepare the Lettuce the same as in No. 819, and when 
cooked drain them on a sieve, and sponge off the grease with a 
napkin. Then bread them and dip them in beaten eggs, and then 
bread them again in fresh bread crumbs. Fry them in hot lard and 
serve them on a napkin, with a garniture of fried parsley. 

LETTUCE WITH CREAM. 

No. 821. — Trim off the outer leaves of one dozen heads of Lettuce 
and wash the heads in cold water several times. Then put them 
in a saucepan, with boiling water lightly salted, and let them cook 
for ten minutes on a brisk fire. Then immerse them in cold water, 
drain them in a colander and press them dry in the hands. Then 
chop them fine. Put sis ounces of butter in a saucepan, and when 
melted add two spoonfuls of flour, and let it cook to a light brown. 
Then add the Lettuce, stirring it in well, and season with salt, 
pepper, and nutmeg. Add in slowly a pint of cream and let it cook 
for ten minutes. Before serving, garnish it with hard boiled eggs, 
cut in quarters, and with toasted bread, cut in fancy shapes. 

LETTUCE, WITH GRAVY. 

No. 822. ^Proceed the same as in No. 821, but in place of cream 
add some veal gravy or a good broth. Garnish with poached eggs 
or toast. 

LETTUCE FOR GARNITURE. 

No. 823. — When Lettuce is to be used for garnishing joints or 
large entrees, use the braized or stuffed Lettuce as in Nos. 817, 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE. 187 

818, 819 and 820. When it is used for garnishing small entrees 
and broiled meats, use Lettuce with cream or gravy, as in Nos. 821 
and 822. When it is used as a salad garniture select the inner 
leaves and steep them in cold water until ready for use. Keep the 
hearts to place on the top of the salad, or cut them in fine shreds 
and garnish around the dish, alternating with eggs. 

LETTUCE SALADS. 

No. 824. — Trim off the outer leaves of the Lettuce, wash the 
heads in cold water, trim the leaves, and then drain them on a 
salad strainer. Before using, drain them on a napkin, being- 
careful not to press the leaves. Put them in a salad bowl and 
season with salt, pepper, sweet oil and vinegar. 

Note. — Dress the salad only when ready for use. Germans generally add some sliced young 
onions and a mustard dressing. This is made by mashing the yolk of a hard boiled egg in a salad 
bowl, diluting it with oil and vinegar, and adding mustard. Then mix It well together and season 
with salt and pepper. Pour this mixture over the Lettuce, and mix it well with a wooden spoon and 
fork in a careful manner. Americans, especially in New England, dress the salad with sugar, vinegar, 
and cream. In the South they use oil, vinegar, salt, and pepper, or with a Mayonnaise dressing, and 
garnished with hard boiled eggs. The French add some fine chopped chervil and tarragon, and 
occasionally a clove of garlic, chopped fine, or some garlic rubbed on a crust of bread (Chapon). 
The Spaniards and Mexicans add some fine sliced green peppers, with sliced green onions. The 
English use a dressing made with the yolks of hard boiled eggs, diluted with oil, vinegar, and the 
juice of onions or shallots, and seasoned with salt and pepper. For a family dinner dish up the 
salad plain, with hard boiled eggs separately, or as a garniture. It requires an expert to dress a salad 
well. When ready for the salad the hostess should dress it, or if one of the company is no*ed as a 
good salad dresser, she should request him to dress it. 

LETTUCE WITH CONSOMME (gAEBURE). 

GRATINATED CRUSTS WITH LETTUCE. 

No. 825. — Trim one dozen heads of Lettuce, wash them well in 
cold water and then parboil them for ten minutes. Then immerse 
them in cold water and press them dry in the hands. Arrange the 
leaves nicely and tie them so they will keep their shape. Now 
prepare a deep, fiat saucepan lined with thin slices of fat pork, 
some trimmings of veal, four sliced carrots and one sliced onion. 
Then put the Lettuce in and add a faggot of parsley garnished with 
one bay leaf and three cloves. Cover it all with thin slices of fat 
pork and moisten with enough broth to cover it. Set it on the fire 
to boil. Then cover the saucepan and set it on one side to cook 
slowly until tender. Then take them out carefully, place them on 
a clean board, take off the strings and cut them in two or three 
parts, lengthwise. Put in a deep baking dish some thin slices of 
toasted bread, then a layer of Lettuce, and continue this way until 
the dish is full. Season with salt and pepper. Then strain off' the

in a flat saucepan and moisten them with enough broth to cover 
them. Let them cook until tender, and then drain them on a napkin. 
■Cut out the stalks, and then cut the heads of Lettuce in half, 
lengthwise, laying the tops over in the middle close together; so 
they will not curl outward. Then put them in square quart tin 
cans, the same way that you would arrange asparagus. Cover them 
^dth water lightly salted, solder on the covers and boil the tin cans 
in a hot water bath for two hours.

French LICORICK. Germau, 

Reglisse. S'dshols-Barenzuker. 

No. 830. — Licorice is a hardy perennial plant, the root of which 
abounds with a sweet juice, and is much used in demulcent compo- 
sitions. It has fleshy, creeping roots, which, when undisturbed, 
attain great length and penetrate deep into the earth. The roots 
are the only part of the plant used, and are used by porter brewers 
and confectioners and for medicinal purposes. The sweet, mucilagi- 
nous juice, which is extracted from the roots by boiling, is much 
esteemed as an emollient for coughs and colds. 

CULTURE. 

No. 831. — It is propagated by planting slips of the roots, four or 
six inches long, that have two or three buds. Plant them in March, 
as soon as the ground can be worked, eighteen inches apart in rows; 
that are three feet apart, covering them with three inches of earth. 
Every year late in autumn, when the sap has gone down and the 
leaves turned yellow, cut the old stem down with a pruning knife 
to a level with the ground. At this time the creeping stems are 
forked up and cut off close to the main stems. They are then 
preserved in sand for future planting. The roots will be ready for 
taking up three years after planting. This should be done towards 
Avinter, when the sap goes down in the roots. A trench three feet 
deep should then be dug around the roots, so they can be extracted 
without injury to them. They are then kept m sand until used.

LIMA BEANS. 

Feve Bohue. 

No. 832. — The Lima Bean is one of the latest and most tender 
of garden beans. The stem is about ten feet high, and the leaves 
are smooth, shiny and narrow, yet comparatively long. The pods 
are about four inches long and an inch and a quarter broad, being 
flattened in shape, and containing from three to five beans. They 
are green and wrinkled when young, and of a yellowish color when. 



190 HAEDEE'S AMERICAN COOKERY. 

ripe. The pods are tougli and parchment-like in all stages of their 
growth, and are never eaten. The Beans when either green or ripe, 
are universally esteemed for their peculiar flavor and excellence. 
If gathered when suitable for use in their green state, and dried in 
the pods, they can be preserved during the winter. When required 
for use, they should be shelled, then soaked for a short time in 
clear water, and cooked the same as green beans. When they are 
treated in this manner, they will be found to be nearly as tender and 
well flavored as when freshly plucked from the plants. The Lima 
Bean seldom perfects its crop in the Northern States, as only a 
small portion of the pods attain a good size, being destroyed by 
early frost. 

CULTURE. 

No. 833. — Commence planting when the weather is settled and 
the soil is warm and in good working condition. Procure a num- 
ber of poles six feet in length and set them out three feet apart 
each way. Plant five or six Beans in each hill, covering them with 
one inch of soil and being careful to set each Bean with its germ 
downward. After they have grown for awhile and before they 
begin to run, pull up the weakest and leave but three of the most 
vigorous plants in each hill. As they increase in height they should 
be tied to the poles with a soft, fibrous material. When they have 
ascended to the tops of the poles the ends should be pinched off. 
The ends of all branches that rise above that height should also be 
treated in the same way. This prevents them from running into 
vines and tends to make them blossom earlier and bear sooner and 
more abundantly. When cultivated near the Sieva, the varieties 
readily hybridize and the Lima Bean rapidly degenerates. Plants 
grown in the Southern States are healthy and vigorous and produce 
large Beans of excellent quality. 

GREEN LIMA BEANS. 

No. 834. — This is a sub-variety of the common Lima Bean, 
differing from it principally, in the pea-green color of the seed. It 
will remain longer on the plant without becoming hard, and is 
considered more tender than other kinds.

No. 836. — The Liine, or Linden Tree, bears a fruit allied to the 
lemon, but smaller and more intensely sour. It is a handsome tree 
and is found in all warm climates. It has panicles of light yellow 
flowers and large cordate leaves. The flowering buds should be picked 
before the rising of the sun. They should then be peeled and dried 
and kept in a clean, cool place, free from dust. They are used for 
tisanes.

LOVAGE. 

Angelique a feuille-d' ache . Lieh stochel. 

No, 837. — Lovage is a hardy perennial plant having a hollow, 
branching stem six or seven feet high. It has smooth, deep green, 
glossy leaves, that somewhat resemble those of celery. The roots 
are large and fleshy, having a dark-brown color without and being- 
yellowish within. Both the roots and seeds are used. The roots 
are sliced and dried and are used by confectioners in that state. 
They are also used in medicine as an aromatic stimulant. 

CULTURE. 

No. 838. — Lovage requires a deep, rich, moist soil, and should 
be sown in August, or immediately after ripening. When the 
young plants have grown three inches, transplant them three feet 
apart iu each direction. When they are well established they will 
require but little care and will continvie for years.

yellow Lupine are grown for their farinaceous seeds. The pods 
are straight and hairy, about three inches long, and contain five or 
six large, white, flattened seeds, having a slightly bitter taste. 
They are said to possess important medicinal qualities. The yellow 
Lupine, which is a native of Sicily, is a hardy annual plant, resem- 
bling the white species. They are both grown in some parts of this 
countr}^ and when in their green state they are cut up and ploughed 
under the soil as a fertilizer. Plant them in poor, dry soil.

MADRAS RADISH. 

Sadis ( Madras) . Betdij ( Madras ) .. 

No. 841. — The Madras Radish is generally cultivated for its 
pods, which are sometimes twelve inches in length. They are 
solid, crisp, and tender, and when young they are used for pickling, 
and for salads, being much superior to the common radish. The 
roots are sometimes eaten whole when they are young and tender, 
but they soon become fibrous, strongly flavored and unfit for use. 
When the Madras Radish is cultivated for its pods, sow it in drills 
that are two feet apart, and thin the jDlants to nine inches apart in 
the drills.

No. 842. — Mallow is an annual plant that was introduced from 
Europe, and which grows spontaneously in gardens when once cul- 
tivated. The stems are frequently more than six feet in height. 
The leaves, which are of a rich green color, are nearly five inches 
in diameter and are smooth, lobed and beautifully frilled or curled 
on the borders. No part of the plant is considered suitable for 
food, but the beautiful leaves are used for garnishing desserts. 
Sow the seeds about the first of May, covering them with one inch 
of soil. The plant requires much space. 



Article CXXIV. 



MARANTA, OR ARROW-ROOT PLANT. 

Arrow-root. Arrow-mehl. 

No. 843. — This is a genus of plants found in tropical America, 
and some species also in India. They have tuberous roots contain- 
ing a large amount of starch, and from one species arrow-root is 
obtained. The Indians are said to employ the roots of this species 
in extracting the poison of arrows, whence the name. The fecula 
obtained is called Arrow-Eoot. The root of this plant is perennial, 
tuberous, fleshy, horizontal and scaly, and is a foot or more in 
length, having- numerous long, white fibres. It sends forth several 
tuberous jointed, curved, white stoles, the points of which some- 
times rise above the ground and become new plants. Several 
stems proceed annually from the same root, being branched and 
slender, and about four inches high. The Arrow-Eoot plant is a 
native of the West Indies, where it is largely cultivated, and its 
cultivation is also carried on in the East Indies, Africa and the 
Southern States. That from the Bermuda Islands is most esteemed, 
Jamaica furnishing the next best qualit}^. The plant is propagated 
early, by cutting off the roots. Arrow-Eoot is adulterated with 
flour from other roots, such as the Curcuma and the Tacca Oceanica 
from the Sandwich Islands. Potato flour is also used. Arrow- 
Eoot when ground, is a light, white powder, devoid of taste or 
13 



194 haedee's ameeican cookeey. 

odor. It has a firm feeling when pressed between the fingers, and 
produces a faint crackling sound when rubbed. It is a pure starch, 
corresponding in its chemical properties with that of corn starch 
or potato starch. When purchased it should be free from any 
unpleasant flavor, as it is liable to get musty. Keep it in a dry 
place. 

PEEPAETION OF ITS FLOUR. 

No. 844. — The flour is prepared in the following manner: The 
roots are dug up when a year old, then washed and pounded into a 
pn.lp, which is thrown into water to separate the amylacteous from 
the fibrous portion. The fibres are removed with the hands, which 
leaves the starch suspended in the water, to which it gives a milky 
color. The milky fluid is strained through a coarse towel, and is 
allowed to stand that the flour may settle. The flour is then washed 
with fresh water and is dried afterwards in the sun. 

ITS USE. 

No. 845. — Arrow-Koot is nutritious and demulcent, and affords a 
light and easily digested article of diet for the sick and convalescent. 
It is peculiarly suited, from its demulcent properties, to those 
afflicted with complaints of the bowels and diseases of the urinary 
passages. It is much vised as food, for infants after weaning or 
when the mother's milk is insufficient. It is prepared by dissolv- 
ing it in hot water with which it forms a pearly gelatinous solution, 
and if sufficiently thick it forms a jelly-like mass when cool. A 
tablespoonf ul will contribute sufficient consistence to a pint of water. 
It should first be made into a paste with a little cold water and the 
boiling water should then be added, with brisk agitation. The 
preparation may be rendered more palatable by adding lemon juice 
and sugar, or, in extreme sickness, by addins^ wine and spices. It 
is usually prepared with milk when taken by children.

and nsed in flavoring stufiings, etc. 

CULTUEE. 

No. 847. — Sow the seeds as early as possible and thin out the 
plants to ten inches apart. It is also propagated by dividing the 
roots either in spring or autumn. 

SWEET MAEJORAM. 

No. 848. — Sweet Marjoram is always treated as an annual in the 
Northern States. The plant grows low, having a branching stem 
and rounded leaves. This variety is said to have come from Portu- 
gal, and is mostly used for culinary purposes. It is highly aro- 
matic, and is used in its green and dried state. 

COMMON MAEJOKAM.

MINT. 

Menthe. Garten Mimze. 

No. 854. — Mint is a hardy perennial aromatic plant, producing, 
by distillation, a highly odoriferous and pungent essential oil. It 
is generally cultivated in gardens, but grows naturally near brooks 
and in rich, moist soil. It is used in making sauces for flavoring, 
for medicinal purposes, for flavoring drinks, and by confectioners. 
The common or plain leaved variety is the best for general use. 
The Spear-Mint is inferior for culinary purposes, but is prettier 
for garnishing, on account of the curled foliage. 

CULTURE. 

No. 855. — It is propagated best by a division of the roots, which 
readily establish themselves wherever planted. In cultivating 
from seed, sow under glass and transplant them when the leaves 
are formed. 

MINT SAUCE, AMEEICAN STYLE. 

No. 856. — Pick one handful of green Mint leaves, wash them 
clean, dry them on a napkin and cut them tine. Put half a pint of

Frencb MOREL. German 

Morille. Morchel. 

No. 858. — In its natural state the Morel is found growing in 
orchards, in damp woods, and in moist pastures. There are 
several varieties, all of which are edible. It is about four inches 
in height and is distinguished by its white cylindrical hol- 
low, and solid smooth stem. Its cap is spherical and hollow, 
and of a dark brown or gravy color. It adheres to the stem by its 
base, and is deeply pitted over the entire surface. It is in perfec- 
tion early in the season, but should not be gathered after a rain or 
while it is wet with dew. If gathered when dry it may be preserved 
many months. The Morel is much used in its dry or fresh state, to 
heighten the flavor of stews and gravies. This mushroom is to be 
obtained from Italian warehouses and is the best variety in use in 
its dried state. 

MOEELS, POULETTE. 

No. 859. — Wash the Morels in tepid water, trim them and then

No. 866.- — Mullen is a field plant. Its leaves and flowers have 
been employed as remedial agents. They have a slight odor and 
a mucilaginous, bitterish, feeble taste. Mullen leaves are demul- 
cent and emollient, and are said to possess anodyne properties, 
which render them useful in pectoral complaints. A strained infu- 
sion of the flowers is used in mild catarrhs and in diarrhoea. It 
will be found advantageous to moisten the leaves previous to boil- 
ing them. Pick the flowers before they expand, dry them in the 
shade, mixing and turning them occasionally to have them perfectly 
dry. Keep them in boxes in a cool dry place, and use them in diet 
drinks (tisanes), as in Article LXXXII.

MUSHROOMS. 

Chcunpignon ou Mou^seron. Champig7i07i, or Ertshiuamm. 

No. 867. — The Mushroom is one of a large class of cryptogamic 
plants of the natural order of t'angi. The name is sometimes pop- 
ularly restricted to such species as are used for food. It is a cellu- 



200 HAEDEE'S AMEEICAN COOItEEY. 

lar plant, liaving generally a more or less rounded thallns supported 
upon a stalk, and liaving seeds upon tlie under surface or gills. 
They are numerous, being found in all parts of the world, and are 
usually of very rapid growth, often springing up and coming to 
maturity in a single day. Many species are used for food in differ- 
ent parts of the world, while other species are poisonous. Many 
varieties abound in the pastures and woods in all the States, and 
may be gathered wild and enjoyed by those who have not the 
means of raising them artificially. The}^ are gathered in all the 
different stages of their growth, and are used boiled, stewed, 
stuffed or broiled, and when dried are used for flavoring. The 
current belief is that, while many fungi are virulently poisonous, 
others, including the common Mushroom, are free from poison, 
and may be eaten in any quantity. The fear of poison deters many 
from making any use of this savory and nourishing but treacherous 
vegetable, and if they are afraid to eat them it is a matter of con- 
siderable importance to have the real standing of fungi as food 
stuffs made clear. According to recent investigations the question 
seems to be, not how to distinguish the poisonous from harmless 
species, but how to treat Mushrooms of every sort in such a way as 
to remove or neutralize the poison which they contain, with the pre- 
caution of using this class of food stuffs at all times with modera- 
tion. It has been ascertained that repeated washing with cold 
water removes most of the poison of Mushrooms, and that boiling 
dissolves out the rest. The water in which Mushrooms are boiled, 
however, is always poisonous, more so even than raw Mushrooms. 
Dried Mushrooms have been found to be dangerous for twenty 
days, and also the water in which such Mushrooms had been boiled. 
They are not really safe until after four months' drying. There- 
fore, treat all Mushrooms as poisonous; carefully throw out all the 
water in which they have been washed; cook them well, and never 
eat them in large quantities. The fact that all Mushrooms are more 
or less poisonous should be no bar to their use as food, proper care 
being taken in the cooking and eating. The detection of poisonous 
Mushrooms is a matter of deep consideration. The surest method 
of detecting them, and a precaution that should always be taken, is 
to put a silver coin or a solid silver spoon in the water in which 
Mushrooms are cooked. If the silver assumes a bluish or black 
color it may be assured that one or perhaps all of the Mushrooms 
are poisonous, and they should be thrown away. 

CULTURE. 

No. 868. — There can be no doubt but what all of the edible kinds 
would finally submit to and probably improve by cultivation, though 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE. 201 

as yet but a single species lias been generally introdncecl into the 
garden. The common Musliroom is the only kind cultivated, and 
can be grown in cellars, sheds, on shelves in the open air, or in 
caves free from iron or coal. Beds of the required width and length 
are made of fermenting horse manure, at a temperature of about 
seventy degrees, being eighteen inches deep. Plant the broken 
pieces of spawn in this bed, six inches apart, covering the whole 
"vsjith two inches of light soil, and protecting it from cold or severe 
rains. The Mushrooms will appear in about six weeks. Irrigate 
only when the bed is quite dry, with soft or lukewarm water. The 
best of all situations, when available, in which to grow Mushrooms, 
are underground caves, such as supply the Paris markets with such 
vast quantities. 

THE COMMON MUSHKOOM. 

No. 869. — When the common Mushroom first appears it has a 
white color, is of a roundish button-like form, and apparently rests 
on the surface of the ground. When fully developed the stem is 
solid and two inches in height, and its cap measures from one to 
four inches in diameter, changing to a brownish color when old and 
becoming tough and fleshy. It is readily distinguished when of 
medium size, by its fine pink or flesh-colored gills and pleasant 
odor. When old, the gills become of a chocolate color and it is 
then liable to be confounded with other kinds of a dubious quality. 
However, the species which resemble it most is slimy to the touch 
and is devoid of its flne odor, having rather a disagreeable smell. 
The noxious kinds always grow in woods or on the margin of woods, 
while the wholesome Mushroom springs up chiefly in open pastures, 
and should be gathered only in such places when young and tender. 
The Mushroom produces no real seed, but instead of it has a white 
fibrous substance in broken threads, called spawn, which is pre- 
served in horse manure, being pressed in the shape of bricks. It 
will preserve its vitality for years when prepared in this manner. 

AGAEICUS COMATUS MUSHROOM. 

No. 870.— This is an excellent variety that is found in abundance 
in stumps of trees in pastures, appearing in spring and autumn. It 
is much used in catsup, but should only be used when young. 

SWEET OR DELICIOUS MUSHROOM. 

No. 871. — This is a variety of medium size, having a yellowish 
color ringed with orange on the top. It somewhat resembles a del- 
eterious species, but is readily distinguished from it, as when it is

while tlie juice of the noxious kind is white and unchangeable. It 
is found in the fall of the year, growing under lir or pine tr -es. 

THE ST. GEORGE MUSHEOOM. 

No. 872. — This is a variety that attains a weight of four or five 
pounds in California, but is not as delicate as the common Mush- 
room. Those grown in Europe are superior to the common Mush- 
room in flavor and are more digestible. It grows in rings in pas- 
tures or in thickets under trees, and reappears for successive years 
on the same spot. 

blewit's blue hats. 

No. 873. — This is a favorite species, and is sold largely in the 
markets. It has a soft, moist, smooth pileus, with a solid bulbous 
stem, tinted with light blue. The gills are of a dingy white color, 
and rounded towards the stem. It should only be gathered in dry 
weather, as it absorbs moisture readily, and thereby is injured in 
flavor and rendered more liable to decay. 

agaricus primulas. ^ 

No. 874. — This variety is found only in spring, and grows in rings 
•on the borders of woodlands, at which time an abundance of its 
spawn can be obtained. It may be preserved by transplanting it 
into bricks of loam and horse manure, in which it will keep for 
several months, tiie same as the spawn of common Mushrooms. 
This variety is used both in its fresh and dried state. It is preserved 
by being cut into quarters, and then dried in the air for several 
days, when it is strung up and kept for future use. 

the fairy king. 

No. 875. — This Mushroom is found growing in rings, and has a 
pileus of a brownish ochre color, which changes to a paler cast as 
it grows, until it gradually fades into a rich, creamish yellow color. 
It is of excellent flavor, and is valuable for domestic use, owing to 
the facility with which it is dried, and its extensive dissemination. 
It may be kept for years without losing its aroma or flavor, 

Note. —The Boletus, Clavaria, and Morel varieties of Mushrooms wHl be found under their 
respective headings. 

HOW TO CLEAN AND PREPARE MUSHROOMS. 

No. 876. — Mushrooms should be used as soon as they are gathered. 
Put the solid ones in one pan, and those that are hollow in another, 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE. 203 

having two quarts of acidulated water in each pan. Wash them 
well, then trim them and put them in separate pans again, that 
contain acidulated water. Let them soak for a while until ready 
1o use them. The small, solid button Mushrooms will resemble the 
cultivated French Mushrooms when cooked, and may be used for 
sauces and small garnitures. Cut off the stems of the hollow ones 
before washing them. The heads are used for stuffing, and are also 
broiled. The toj)s of the solid ones should be cut in crescent-like 
grooves, to give them a fancy appearance. The trimmings are 
chopped fine, and are used with fine herbs. 

COOKED MUSHROOMS, FOR CxENERAL PURPOSES. 

No. 877. — When the Mushrooms are washed and cleaned as in 
No. 876, select a saucepan that is not too large for the quantity of 
Mushrooms to be cooked. Put two pounds of fresh Mushrooms in 
the saucepan and add four ounces of butter, a quarter of a glassful 
of cold water, and the juice of two lemons. Cover the saucepan, 
put it on a brisk fire, and when the Mushrooms have boiled for two 
or three minutes, pour them into an earthen jar. When they are 
cold cover them with a buttered paper cover and keep them in a 
cool place. They may be used for any kind of sauces or garnitures. 
The juice is added to sauces to reduce them. 

Note.— When cooking large quantities of Mushrooms, put the saucepan on the fire and add 
them when the liquid boils. \ wine-glassful of water will be sufficient for five pounds of Mush- 
rooms. 

MUSHROOMS, WITH ALLEMxiNDE SAUCE. 

No. 878. — Reduce some Allemande sauce with some Mushroom 
gravy and then add the Mushrooms. If they are small leave them 
whole; if large, cut off the stems and slice them as desired. 

MUSHROOMS, WITH ESPAGNOLE SAUCE.

juice of half a lemon. Set the saucepan on a brisk fire, stirring its 
contents occasionally, until the moisture is well reduced. Then put 
them in a mortar and pound them fi.ne, and return them to the 
saucepan. Then add five spoonfuls of AUemande or Cream sauce, 
season it with salt, pepper and nutmeg, and let it simmer slowly 
for fifteen minutes. Then rub it through a fine sieve, and put it in 
a flat saucepan, reducing it with half a cup of cream. Before 
serving, add a piece of butter. 

Note. — Half a pound of cooked forced meat of chicken may be added, instead of the AUemande 
or Cream sauce. Keep the puree In a cool place, and when ready for use, add a piece of butter and 
bring it almost to the boiling point, stirring it all continually. 

BEOILED MUSHROOMS ON TOAST, MAITEE d' HOTEL. 

No. 882. — Wash and clean two dozen large Mushrooms, cut off 
the stems and dry them on a napkin. Put them in an earthen bowl 
with two or three spoonfuls of sweet oil, a little salt and the juice 
of one lemon. Half an hour before using them cover them with a 
buttered paper cover and let them macerate. Broil them on a fire 
that is not too brisk and serve them on a hot plate on pieces of hot 
buttered toast, with the bottoms of the Mushrooms upwards. Mix

No. 908. — This is a delicious species of melon; so called on 
account of its musky fragrance. Owing to the great facility witli 



212 haedee's ameeican cookeey. 

which the various kinds intermix or hybridize, the varieties are not 
only numerous, but are constantly increasing. Familiar names of 
different varieties are clianged annually, as new kinds with superior 
recommendations spring up, and are offered as welcome substitutes 
for the old kinds. 

CULTURE. 

No. 909. — Cultivate them as you would cucumbers, except that 
the hills should be six feet apart, but avoid planting them near 
cucumbers, as they will mix with and injure the quality of the 
melons; this, and heavy rains at the time of ripening, will destroy 
the flavor of the finest stock. Eich earth for the young plants is 
far better than manure, but if the latter must be used, see that it is 
well rotted. If the plants grow very rank, more and finer fruit will 
be secured by pinching off the ends of the shoots when about three 
feet long. Cantaloupes are cultivated in the same manner. 

beech wood melon. 

No. 910. — The melon is nearly spherical, but is somewhat longer 
than broad. The skin is of a greenish yellow color, thickly and

basin, to which add five pints of vinegar. Make it boil, and pour 
it boiling hot over the melons which you have put in a jar. Drain 
off the syrup the next day, then boil it and skim it, and pour it 
boiling hot over the melons. Kepeat this every day for five days. 
On the sixth day boil the syrup again, adding to it one ounce of 
white ginger, a small stick of cinnamon, six cloves, and the melons. 
Let it boil slowly for fifteen minutes, skim it clear, and then take 
it off of the fire to get cool. When cold put them in glass jars and 
cover them tightly. 

PRESERVED MELONS IN SYRUP. 

No. 923. — Cut the melons in quarters, take out the seeds, and 
peel off the rinds. Parboil them for three minutes, then immerse

French MUSTARD. German 

Moutarde. Senf. 

No. 924. — There are five kinds of Mustard, the plant and the seed 
having a pungent taste. A condiment is made from the ground 
seeds, which are also used as remedial agents, being useful 
esternally in cataplasms, and internally as a diuretic and irritant. 
The rough leaves of the White Mustard plant, when young and 
undeveloped, make a pungent salad when mised with water cress. 
They are also cooked and prepared the same as spinach. The Black 
Mustard seed makes the most piquant Mustard for table purposes. 

CULTURE. 

No. 925. — Sow the seeds thickly in rows and cut the plants when 
they are about two inches high. For a crop of seeds sow in April, 
in drills one foot apart, and thin the plants out moderately when 
they are about three inches high. For use during winter it may be 
sown at intervals in boses, in the green house or in frames. 

WHITE MUSTARD. 

No. 926. — The White Mustard plant is a hardy annual that grows 
in gardens and fields, having thin stems that attain a height of 
about three feet. The leaves are large and of a rich deep green 
color. When it is grown in gardens for salad or greens sow it as 
early as the ground will admit, in drills ten inches apart. Remove 
the weeds and water it well in dry weather. Cut the plants when 
in seed leaf, as when they become developed they get strong and 
ill-flavored.

No. 937. — When they are cultivated for their flowers or seeds 
they should be j)lanted in poor, light soil. The drills are made 
three feet apart, and the young plants should be thinned out to six 
inches apart. The young crop is supported by staking or bushing, 
the same as peas, and requires much attention. See that they are 
properly attached to the stakes, and keep the ground free from 
weeds.

SMALL NASTURTIUM. 

No. 938. — This is a dwarf variety, the stem rarelv measuring more 
than two feet in length. The flowers are yellow and the pods are 
small, being preferred to the others for pickling. It yields 
iibundantly. 

TALL NASTURTIUM. 

No. 939. — This variety is very ornamental for covering arbors, 
Jiaving a stem from six to eight feet high. Sow it in rich made 
soil to have luxuriant foliage. It has large yellow flowers, with the 
upper petals slightly streaked and marked with purple. 

DARK FLOWERING. 

No. 940. — This variety is similar to the Tall Nasturtium, except 
that the flowers are of a dark brown color. 

NASTURTIUM SEED BUDS, PICKLED. 

No. 941. — Pick the quantity of seed buds desired, and put them 
in bottles. Boil some good wine vinegar, and when it is cold pour 
it over the seed buds in the bottles, and add a sprig of tarragon. 
They are used the same as capers.

rrenck NETTLE. German 

Ortie. Nessel. 

No. 942. — The common Nettle is a hardy, herbaceous perennial, 
which grows naturally and in abundance by the wayside, but it is 
seldom seen where people have not been at work; hence it is consid- 
ered a sort of domestic plant. The stem is erect and branching, while 
the leaves are heart-shaped at the base, toothed on the borders, and 
thickly set with small, stinging hair-like bristles. The common 
Nettle produces a large proportion of fiber, which is used in making 
ropes, cordage, sewing thread, and white linen cloth of superior 
quality. Like many other common plants the superior merit of 
these troublesome weeds has been greatly overlooked. Early in 
April the tops will furnish tender leaves that are used as a pot herb 
for soups, or are prepared the same as spinach. The cultivated 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE. 219 

Nettle is used most, being propagated from roots that are planted 
either in pots or in the forcing house. They will soon send up an 
abundance of tender tops. They may be blanched by covering 
them with other pots. If planted close to a flue in the vineyard 
they will produce excellent Nettle-kale or Nettle-spinach in January 
or February.

FrencU NEW ZEALAND SPINACH. Cerman 

Epiaart {Belle dame) . SiAnat 

No. 943. — This Spinach is quite distinct from the common garden 
Spinach, varying essentially in its general habit. It is a hardy annual 
plant, and is more productive than the average of spinaceous plants. 
The leaves are of a fine green color, large, broad, thick and fleshy. 
The leaves are the parts of the plant eaten, being gathered as they are 
developed, leaving the ends of the young shoots uninjured. If not 
cut to excess the plant will yield abundantly until destroyed by 
frost. The leaves retain their fresh, succulent character after they 
are fully grown, and even under the influence of the heat and 
draught. It is prepared the same as common garden Spinach for 
table use.

NUTMEG. 

Muscade (Noix). Muslcatenmis. 

No. 944. — The Nutmeg tree is about thirty feet high, with 
numerous branches, and an aspect somewhat resembling that of the 
orange tree. The leaves stand alternately on short foot stalks, and 
are oblong-oval, pointed, entire, undulated, bright green and some- 
what glossy on their upper surface, whitish beneath, and of an 
aromatic taste. The flowers are male and female on different trees. 
The former are disposed in axillary, peduncled, solitary clusters, 
and the latter are single, solitary, and axillary. Both are minute 
and of a pale yellowish color. The fruit which appears on the tree 
mingled with the flowers, is round or oval; of the size of a small 
peach, smooth, at first pale green, but yellow when ripe, and marked 
with a longitudinal furrow. The external covering, which is at first

thick and fleshy, and abounds in an austere, astringent juice, 
afterwards becomes dry and coriaceous, and, separating into two 
valves from the apex, discloses a scarlet, reticulated membrane, 
commonly called mace, closely investing a thin, brown, shining- 
shell, which contains the kernel or Nutmeg. It is a native of the 
Moluccas and other neighboring islands, and abounds in the Banda 
Islands, whence the chief supplies of Nutmegs were long derived. 
Numerous varieties are cultivated in Sumatra, Java, Penang, Ceylon, 
and other parts of the East Indies, and have been introduced into 
the Isles of France and Bourbon, Cayenne, and several of the West 
India islands. The Penang Nutmegs are distinguished by not being 
limed. When Nutmeg is cut or broken it presents a yellowish 
surface, varied with a reddish brown, branching, irregular veins, 
which give to it a marbled appearance. These dark veins abound 
in oily matter, upon which the medicinal properties depend. The 
odor of Nutmeg is delightfully fragrant, the taste warm, aromatic, 
and grateful. Its virtues are extracted by alcohol and ether. The 
largest Nutmegs are the most expensive. They should be rejected 
when very light, with a feeble taste and smell, worm eaten, musty, 
or marked with black veins. Nutmeg has considerable narcotic 
power, and when taken in doses of from two to three drams will 
produce stupor and delirium, and dangerous if not fatal conse- 
quences. It is frequently used as an agreeable addition to 
farinaceous articles of diet, and to various kinds of drink in cases 
of languid appetite and delicate stomach. It is usually given in 
substance, and is brought by grating to the state of a powder. Its 
pleasant flavor makes it invaluable in cookery for seasoning. Nut- 
meg should always be purchased entire, as when it is ground it soon 
loses its strength. To ascertain if they are fresh stick a pin in one, 
and if the pin is oily when you withdraw it the Nutmeg is fresh. 
When dry they are of no use.

French OATS. German 

Fariue D'Avoine. Hafermehl. 

No. 946. — The common white Oat is specifically distinguished by 
its loose panicle, its two-seeded glumes, and its smooth seeds, one 
of which is awned. It is cultivated all over the world chiefly for 
horses, but the grain is very nourishing and is largely consumed as 
food in Great Britain and other countries. A decoction is said to 
possess decided diuretic properties, and to be useful in dropsy. 
The seeds deprived of their husks are sometimes called groats. As 
a food coarsely ground Oat meal is usually preferred to the fine meal. 
Oat meal is very slightly, but not unpleasantly, bitter, and yields 
most of its nutritive matter readily to boiling water. Gruel made 
from Oat meal affords a nutritious and easily digested aliment. It 
is generally administered after brisk cathartics to render them 
easier and more efficient in their action, 

BLACK CHAMPION. 

No. 947. — This new Oat possesses great merit. Its tillering 
properties are remarkable. The heads, or panicles, are long and 
very spreading, averaging sixty or seventy spikelets, from twelve to 
eighteen inches in length, with two large grains to each spinkel.et. 
The kernels are extra large, plump and heavy, black and glossy; 
are without awns, while the husk is thin and soft. The straw is 
from three to six feet long, stiff and elastic, does not lodge, and, so 
far seems to be rust-proof. Only half the quantity of seed should 
be sown, compared with other sorts. 

AMERICAN TRIUMPH. 

No. 948. — This variety has many excellent qualities. Its average 
height when standing in the field is six feet, yet the straw is so 
strong anrl firm that it holds up well, without lodging. The tall, 
luxuriant heads are filled with plump, heavy grains. 



222 haeder's ameeican cookeey, 

EUSSIAN white OATS. 

No. 949. — This grain is very productive, a single grain giving 
sixteen stalks in many instances. It is generally free from rust, 
and is well adapted for general use. 

GEUEL. 

No. 950. — Gruel is prepared in different ways with oat meal flour, 
and with the grain. Use fresh flour only, as it is liable to have a 
sour taste, if not kept in a dry, warm place. When using flour the 
gruel is prepared with water, milk or broth, then sweetened with 
sugar or honey, and flavored with the juice of a lemon. When 
making gruel from the whole grains steep them in cold water over 
night, then drain them and let them cook slowly in water or milk, 
and when cooked strain the gruel through a towel with pressure, and 
sweeten to taste. 

OAT MEAL GEUEL. 

No. 951. — Oat meal gruel may be prepared by boiling an ounce 
of meal with three pints of water to a quart, straining the decoction, 
allowing it to stand until it cools, and then pouring ofl" the clear 
liquor from the sediment. Sugar and lemon juice may be added 
to improve its flavor; raisins are not unfrequently boiled with the 
meal and water for the same purpose. 

SCOTCH OAT MEAL GRUEL. 

No. 952. — Soak one pound of Oat meal over night, then strain the 
liquid through a towel, with pressure, to extract as much of the 
farinaceous matter as will go throagh. Put one quart of water 
in a saucepan, and when it boils add a little salt and the liquid 
extracted from the Oat meal. Let it boil down until it thickens, 
and serve it hot, or allow it to cool to a jelly-like mass, and serve 
it with cream and powdered sugar . 

OAT MEAL POREIDGE. 

No. 953. — Boil two quarts of water in a sauce pan, season it with 
salt, and drop in slowly one pound of Oat meal while stirring it 
with a wooden spoon. Let it boil slowly for a few minutes, then 
set it on the side of the fire to boil slowly for three quarters of an 
hour, stirring it up occasionally from the bottom. A little milk 
and butter may be added before serving, or serve it with a pitcher 
of cream, some sugar and butter.

FrcEch OKRA, OR GUMBO. German 

Gumbo. Ocher. 

No. 955. — Okra is an annual plant from the West Indies and 
South America, and is largely raised in the Southern States. It is 
cultivated for its green seed pods, which are used in soups and 
served as a vegetable. The pods when young and tender should be 
cut in sections, strung on twine and hung up in the shade to cure 
(the same way as dried fruit). In this condition the Okra can be^ 
used for soup at any time. 

CULTURE. 

No. 956. — Sow the seed thinly in dry, warm soil, in shallow drills 
two feet apart. Cover the seeds lightly, and after the plants are 
up thin them out to nine inches apart. Hoe frequently and draw 
a little earth to the stems as they continue to grow. Gather the- 
pods when quite green and about an inch and a half long.

and is similar to the dwarf plant with the exception of being larger 
in size. 

STEWED OKEA, PLAIN. 

No. 960. — Cut the stems from fifty Okra, and put them into a sauce- 
pan with boiling water to cover. Season with salt and cook them 
on a brisk fire until they are tender. Then drain them and dish 
them up, pouring over them a little melted butter, with which add 
the juice of a lemon and some salt and pepper. 

STEWED OKEA, WITH TOMATOES. 

No. 961. — Cut the stems from two dozen Okra, put them into a 
saucepan with one dozen peeled tomatoes cut in quarters, and 
moisten with two soup-spoonfuls of water. Add a piece of butter 
and season with salt and pepper. Let them simmer for half an 
hour. 

Note. — When cooked they may be baked by being put in a buttered deep baking dish and sprink- 
led over with fresh bread crumbs. Wipe the Ijorder, put a piece of butter on top, divided in small 
parts, and bake in a moderate oven. 

OKEA STEWED WITH FINE HEEBS. 

No. 962. — Cut off both ends of some Okra, wash them in cold 
water and then put them into a saucepan witli a pint of boiling 
water and a little salt. Let them boil on a brisk fire, and when 
tender drain off some of the liquid, add a piece of butter and sea- 
son with salt, pepper and a little fine chopped parsley. 

OKEA SALAD. 

No. 963. — When the Okra is boiled as in No. 960 drain them, and 
when cold slice them and add a few finely sliced green peppers, 
vinegar, oil and a few chopped chives. 

OKEA FOE GAENITUEE. 

No. 964. — When used for garniture in stews, add the Okra when 
the meats are nearly cooked. Leave the smaller pods whole and 
cut the larger ones in half.

No. 965. — Cut the Okra iu slices an eighth of an inch thick and 
add them to the soup fifteen minutes before serving. Let it boil 
slowly. 

DRY OKRA, ITS USE. 

No. 966. — Dry Okra is used for soup when the green variety is 
not to be had. Wash it in cold water and let it soak for an hour, 
then proceed as above, care being taken to have only a good qual- 
ity or the Okra will taste like hay. When the best quality of canned 
Okra can be had it will be found far superior to the dry, and it 
needs only to be added to the soup a few minutes before serving. 

OKRA, OR GUMBO SOUP, WITH CHICKEN. 

No. 967. — Cut two tender chickens into small pieces, about three 
quarters of an inch thick, and put them in a saucepan with a piece 
of butter. Fry them lightly and then add two medium-sized onions, 
chopped finely, with half their quantity of lean, raw ham, cut the 
same way. Cook them for a few minutes, then moisten with a 
gallon of chicken or veal broth. When it boils skim off the grease 
and add a faggot of parsley garnished with celery and a leek. 
Season with salt and pepper, add two green peppers cut into small 
slices and set it on the side of the fire to boil slowly. When the 
chicken is half cooked add one dozen of peeled tomatoes cut in 
quarters (or if they are large into six parts), with four ounces of 
Carolina rice and about fifty sliced Okra. When they are cooked 
skim the soup, take out the faggot, and serve. When properly 
cooked the broth will be found to have a mucilaginous consistency.

French ONIONS. German 

Oignun. Zwiebeln. 

No. 968. — The Onion is a half-hardy biennial plant. The roots 
and leaves, however, are annual, as they usually perish during the 
first year. The bulbs, for which the plant is generally cultivated, 
are biennial, and differ to a considerable extent in their size, form, 
and color. It contains considerable nutriment and has valuable 
15

medicinal qualities. The disagreeable odor it imparts to the breath 
may be avoided in a great measure by thorough cooking, or by 
eating a few leaves of parsley. Much depends upon the climate 
and soil as well as the quality of seed, which exerts a great influence 
on the crop, and to this end great care should be exercised in 
selecting the seed. The white Onion is much sweeter than the red. 
Onions are used more than any other vegetable for culinary 
purposes. 

PREPARATION OF THE SOIL. 

No. 969. — A good crop of Onions can be raised in any soil which 
will produce a full crop of corn, unless it be stiff clay, very light 
sand or gravel, or certain varieties of muck or swamp land. There 
is no crop in which the quality of the manijre used is of greater 
importance than in this. If it is too rank it is quite sure to make 
soft Onions, with many scullions. It should be fermented during 
the previous summer to kill the wheat seeds. All refuse of the 
previous crop should be removed, the manure spread evenly, and 
the ground plowed a moderate depth, in order to thoroughly mix th& 
manure with the soil. Cultivate as early in the spring as the ground 
will permit. It is impossible to cultivate the crop economically 
unless the rows are perfectly straight, and to secure this, stretch a 
line along one side, fourteen feet from the edge, and make a distinct 
mark as a guide. Then having made a wooden marker something 
like a giant rake (with five teeth about a foot long, and fourteen 
inches apart), make four more marks by carefully drawing it with 
the outside tooth in the line and the head at right angles to the- 
perfectly straight mark made by the line. Continue to work around 
this line until on the third passage of the marker you reach the 
side of the field where you began. Measure fifteen feet two inches 
from the last row, stretch the line again and mark around in the, 
same way. This is much better than to stretch a line along one 
side. Sow the seed as soon as the ground is ready, which can be 
done best by a hand seed drill. 

CULTURE, 

No. 970. — As soon as the Onions are up so they can be seen the 
length of the rows, hoe them by just skimming the ground between 
the rows. A few days after give them the second hoeing. This, 
time hoe close up to the plants. After this weeding must commence, 
which should be done thoroughly and carefully, stirring the earth 
around the plants in order to destroy any weeds that have just- 
started and cannot be seen. In about two weeks they will require 
another hoeing and weeding, similar to the last, and two weeks. 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE. 227 

later another if necessary. If the work is carefully done the crojD 
will need no further attention until ready to gather. Then, as soon 
as the tops die and fall, the crop should be gathered by pulling 
four rows and laying them in one row (the tops all one way), and 
then forming a similar row with the tops in the opposite direction. 
If the weather is fine they will require no attention, while curing, 
but if not they will need to be stirred, by simply moving them 
slightly along the row. When the tops are perfectly dry cut them 
off half an inch from the bulb and throw each pair of rows together, 
forming windrows about nine feet apart. After a few days of bright 
weather they will be fit to store away. 

HOW TO KEEP ONIONS THROUGH THE WINTEE. 

No. 971. — It is essential for the preservation of Onions to keep 
them dry, to have thorough ventilation, and to keep them free from 
frost. One of the most popular methods of keeping Onions is to 
spread straw to the depth of fifteen inches on a dry floor and upon 
this spread the Onions ten inches deep and cover them with one foot 
of straw. They will then keep in fine condition for months. Upon 
the approach of cold weather close the doors and windows, keeping 
the temperature just above the freezing point. With proper care 
they can be kept sound until spring. 

EEMAEKS ON SMALL ONIONS. 

No. 972. — It is difficult to grow Onions from seed in certain 
localities, while from sets good Onions are grown quite early. The 
sets are little Onions grown up the previous year and taken up when 
as large as peas. When set out in the spring they very soon form 
good large Onions. There are two kinds of Onions that are not 
grown from seed, the Potato and the Top Onion. The Potato 
Onion grows in clusters under the ground. These little bulbs are 
planted in the spring and produce large Onions. The large Onions 
are planted the next spring and produce the clusters. The Top 
Onion produces the small clusters on the top of the stem, where 
the seed is produced in the common varieties. These small Onions- 
are planted in the spring and the result is full grown Onions; the 
large ones with a year's growth produce the clusters. 

EAELY EED GLOBE. 

No. 973. — This variety is globe-shaped and very handsome in 
appearance. The skin has a deep red color, and the flesh is mild 
and tender.

EAELY NEOPOLITAN MARZAJOLA. 

No. 982. — A beautiful wliite-skinned flat variety, and a good 
keeper. If it is sown in February or March, a crop will mature 
early in the season. 

GIANT ROCCA. 

No. 983. — This variety is well adapted for culinary purposes, 
having a mild flavor, tender flesh and a light brown skin. It pro- 
duces large globular Onions from seed the first season, but to attain 
its largest growth, the smallest bulbs should be set out the nest 
spring, when they will continue increasing in size instead of pro- 
ducing seed. 

GIANT WHITE ITALIAN TRIPOLI. 

No. 984.— This is a large, beautiful, pure white flat variety, that 
will produce large Onions from seed, but to attain their largest size 
the small bulbs should be set out the following spring. The flavor 
is mild and excellent. 

NEW QUEEN. 

No, 985. — This variety grows quickly and keeps well. If sown 
in February, it will produce Onions two inches in diameter early 
in summer. If sown in July, they will be ready to pull out in 
autumn, and will be sound and fit for use until the following 
autumn. If sown thickly, they will mature perfectly hard. They 
are particularly valuable for pickling. 

RED, YELLOW OR WHITE BOTTOM SETS, 

No. 986. — The sets are produced by sowing the seed very thickly 
in the spring, without thinning them out; they mature when about 
one inch up. Their use is precisely the same as the Top Onions — 
to set them out in the spring instead of sowing seed. The seed of 
the White Silver Skin or the White Portugal varieties, is used for 
the White Set. They do not keep as well as the others, but produce 
small white Onions early in the season. 

ENGLISH MULTIPLIER. 

No. 987. — Esteemed by many as the best variety for early use. 
It is large in size, of a mild, sweet sugary flavor, very early and a 
large producer. The large Onions produce several small Onions 
in clusters around the bulb, growing mostly on the top of the 
ground. 



230 haedee's ameeican cookeey 

potato onion. 

No. 988. — This variety produces a quantity of young bulbs on 
tlie root, which should only be planted in spring, six inches apart, 
in rows that are eighteen inches wide, under one inch of soil. The 
English Multiplier should be planted in the same way. The large 
bulbs produce small Onions and the small bulbs large ones. 

PLAIN BOILED ONIONS. 

No. 989. — Peel two dozen medium-sized Onions, cut off the roots 
and stems and be careful not to injure the skin. Put them in a 
saucepan, cover them with water, add a little salt and a piece of 
butter, cover the saucepan, set it on a brisk fire and when they are 
tender strain oif the water and serve them with melted butter. 

BOILED ONIONS, WITH BUTTER OR CREAM SAUCE. 

No. 990. — Boil the Onions in the same manner as in No. 989, and 
when tender drain off the water and add three spoonfuls of Butter 
or Cream sauce. Let them simmer for five minutes and then serve. 

EEIED ONIONS. 

No. 991. — Peel three or four Onions, cut off the roots and stems 
slice them crosswise and with the finger detach the rings. Season 
w4th salt, flour them and mix them well together. Put them in a 
colander and shake off the superfluous flour. Then fry them in hot 
lard, and when they are nicely colored, drain them on a napkin 
and serve. 

SMOTHERED ONIONS. 

No. 992. — Peel half a dozen Onions, cut them in halves, trim oft 

. the ends, slice them finely and put them in a saucepan with a piece 

of butter. Cover the saucepan and put them on a slow fire to 

simmer (stirring them occasionally) and when lightly colored drain 

off the butter and serve them as needed. 

GLAZED ONIONS. 

No. 993. — Peel two dozen small white Onions of equal size, and 
be careful not to cut the tops or roots too much, or they will come 
apart when they are being cooked. Put them in a flat saucepan 
with a piece of butter, season with salt and sprinkle them with a 
little powdered sugar. Moisten them, to cover, with broth (or 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE. 231 

water), put them on a brisk fire and when the moisture is half 
reduced, set them in a moderate oven, occasionally shaking them 
over. When the moisture is reduced to a glaze roll the Onions in it 
so as to glaze them evenly, and use them as needed. 

NjTE. — When they are to be serve 1 with a sauce, dish up the Onions when they are cooked and 
glazed, and aid to the glaze two soup-spoonfuls of Espagnole sauce, and one of gravy. Then let it 
boil slowly, skim off the grease, reduce it to its consistency and pour it over the Onions. 

STUFFED ONIONS. 

No. 994. — Take half a dozen white Onions of equal size, peel them 
carefully, but do no not cut the end parts too deep. Parboil them 
for ten minutes in water lightly salted; to which add a piece of 
butter. Drain them, and then dry them on a napkin. When cool 
scoop out the center of each Onion and fill them with a forced meat 
of veal of chicken, into which add some cooked fine herbs. Arrange 
the Onions in a buttered flat saucepan, close together, and 
season them with salt and a little sugar. Cover each Onion with a 
thin slice of fat pork, moisten them with broth, and set them on the 
fire. When it boils put on the cover and set the pan in a moderate 
oven. When cooked dish them up, strain the gravy in another 
saucepan and skim off the grease. Add three spoonfuls of 
Espagnole sauce to reduce it to its consistency, and serve it on the 
dish with the Onions. 

STUFFED ONIONS, AMERICAN STYLE. 

No. 995. — Prepare the Onions in the same manner as in No. 994, 
and when they are drained and cooled, scoop out the center of each 
one, which you will chop finely, and add enough of fresh bread 
crumbs to give a nice consistency. Also add two tablespoonfuls of 
fresh mushrooms finely chopped, two tablespoonfuls of cooked fine

Then put them in a fiat saucepan with a piece of butter, a pinch of 
sugar and a little salt, and moisten them to cover with white broth. 
Set them in a moderate oven to glaze, tossing them over occasionally, 
so they will glaze evenly. These Onions are used with stews, beef 
a la "mode, and for mixed vegetable garnitures. For large garni- 
tures the stufi'ed Onions may be used. For chops or small 
entrees the white or brown puree of Onions soubise is used. 
Small Onions, when plainly boiled and tossed over the fire (with the 
addition of a little Cream or Allemande sauce), may also be used. 

SMALL ONIONS BAKED FOR GARNITURE, SPANISH STYLE.

plied by the term chop), but should be finely cut with a knife. 
When the Onions are peeled, cut them in halves, take one part and 
slice it finely without detaching the pieces; then slice it the same 
way crosswise; then cut straight down. In this way you can make 
the pieces of any desired size, and will always have them uniform 
and perfectly square. If chopped Onions are to be kept for some 
time, dip them in boiling water for one minute, then immerse them 
in cold water, drain them on a towel, and wring the moisture from 
them. In this manner, the Onions will remain white. If treated 
differently, they will soon turn black.

leafy, emarginate appendage at the base of the petals. The fruit 
or pod is of an oblong form, often contracted at the middle, but 
sometimes of bottle form, reticulated, and of a yellowish color. 
The kernels, of which the pod contains from one to three, are 
oblong, quite white, and are enclosed in a thin brown skin or 
pellicule. A remarkable peculiarity of this plant is that the lower 
blossoms alone produce the fruit. After the decay of the petals 
the ovaries insinuate themselves into the ground, beneath which at 
a depth of several inches, the fruit is afterwards perfected. They 
a,re eaten roasted, and are used by confectioners, and for culinary 
purposes as a substitute for almonds. 

CULTUKE. 

No. 10j5. — The Pea-nut succeeds well only in warm climates. 
Plant them as early as the weather becomes suitable, in a warm, 
light, loamy soil, deeply ploughed and pulverized, in rows a foot 
apart. In planting, the Pea-nut should be unbroken in the pod, and 
as soon as the flower appears the vines are earthed up from time to 
time, so as to keep them chiefly within the ground. 

AFKICAN PEA-NUT. 

No. 1056. — A comparatively small, smooth, and regularly formed 
sort. The shell is thin, usually enclosing two kernels. 

WILMINGTON PEA-NUT. 

No. 1057. — Similar to the African. The pods, however, are 
longer, and the shell thicker and paler. They enclose two or three 
kernels. They are cultivated largely in the Southern States.

French PKAS. Geruiau 

Pois. Erbsen. 

No. 1059. — The Pea is a hardy annual plant, and its cultiva- 
tion is almost universal. The green Pea is a delicious vegeta- 
ble, and is highly esteemed for its flavor and taste. To have them 
in perfection they must be plucked before they mature, and should 
be shelled and cooked as soon after as possible, as they lose much 
of their tenderness and flavor if kept for any length of time. The 
fact that those brought from a distance seldom reach the markets 
in their perfect state is an objection to their use, which, coupled 
with the knowledge that when they are closely packed they become 
intensely overheated and are rendered devoid of taste and unwhole- 
some, deters many from using this popular vegetable. When sent 
from a distance they should be packed in open baskets (not in boxes, 
barrels or sacks), and laid in layers two inches deep, alternating 
with layers of clean straw. There are hundreds of varieties, but 
they differ very little from each other. New kinds are introduced 
annually, each claiming to be superior sorts, but the locality has a 
great deal to do with their quality. The field Peas can be used in 
their dry state for purees and soups, but they are not as easily 
digested as the other kinds. 

CULTURE. 

No. 1060. — Peas come earliest to maturity in light rich soil. For 
a general crop a deep loam or a soil strongly inclining to clay is best. 
For an early crop decomposed leaves or leaf mold should be used, 
or, if the soil is very poor, stronger manure may be used. For 
general crops a good dressing should be applied, and for the dwarf 
growing kinds the soil cannot be too rich. When grown as a 
maiket crop Peas are never staked, and are sown in single rows 
two or three inches deep and from two to three feet apart, according 
to variety or the strength of the soil. When grown in small 
quantities for private use, they are generally sown in double rows 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE. 247 

six or eight inches apart, and the tall varieties are staked up with 
brush. For an early crop sow them in February, March or April, 
according to latitude, as soon as the ground can be worked. Make 
repeated sowings every two weeks in succession. After the first of 
June, sowing should be discontinued until the middle of August, 
when a good crop may sometimes be secured by sowing an early 
sort.

PEPPER. 

Poivre et Piment. Pfeffer. 

No. 1096. — There are many varieties of Pepper, both annual and 
perennial, the latter being of a shrubby or woody character, and 
as it is a tropical plant, it is tender. The annual varieties can be 
grown in the Middle and Southern States successfully. 

The annual, or commoa garden Pepper, is a native of India. 

Pepper is used more than any other spice. There are three kinds 
in use — the White, Black, and Ked. It facilitates digestion and

corrects flatulency. In warm countries it is used in great quantities, 
but for good cooking it should be used with moderation, and 
persons of nervous debility should abstain from using any. For 
persons living on plain food, and having out-of-door work, it 
imparts vitality, and is very beneficial. There are also a large 
variety of Peppers eaten and prepared in their green state, and put 
up like pickles. The large Bell Peppers are stuffed and used as a 
vegetable, and are also excellent for pickling, and when sliced are 
much esteemed in salads, in connection with tomatoes and cucumbers. 

CULTURE. 

No. 1097. — Sow in hot beds early in April, and transplant to the 
open ground when the weather is favorable. They should be

They are produced in the greatest profusion, and will be found 
useful in the preparation of pepper sauces, and when pickled as 
soon as plucked. To prepare them for use in their dry state, it is 
only necessary to cut the plants close to the roots when the fruit is 
ripe. String the berries and hang them up in a warm, dry room. 
They will retain their piquancy for years. The plant is so beautiful 
that when grown in pots it will always prove ornamental; the 
glossy, coral red of the numerous pods presenting a fine contrast 
to the deep green foliage surrounding them.

No. 1122. — This is an annual plant, a native of China. The 
leaves are of an oval form, rounded at the ends, somewhat blistered 
on the surface, and at the center are collected into a long and rather 
compact tuft or head. The plant, when well grown and ready for 
use, resembles a head of Cos lettuce, and will weigh six or seven 
pounds. It is used like common cabbage, being sweet, mildly 
flavored, and easy to digest. The young plants are also boiled like 
spinach.

PICKLES. 

Cornichon. Essiggurhen. 

No. 1123 — Small cucumbers are best for pickling, and for this 
purpose they must be plucked young, when they attain the proper 
size. The fruit should not be permitted to ripen on the vines, for 
if allowed to do so the plants become much less productive. See 
Pickled Cucumbers, Nos. 641 and 642. 

MIXED PICKLES. 

No. 1124. — Are composed of young cucumbers, cauliflower, 
peppers, string beans and onions. The mode of pickling them 
has been described. When ready for pickling put them into glass 
jars with a few juniper berries. Dilute some mustard flour with 
vinegar, season it with a pinch of red pepper and pour it over them, 
to cover. Then seal the jar hermetically.

No. 1125. — Select five dozen small cucumbers, of from one to one 
and a lialf inches in length ; four dozen small, white peeled onions, 
half a dozen small green peppers, and the flower buds of two tender 
cauliflowers, separated into small pieces. Put them into a strong 
brine for two days, then drain them in a colander and pour luke- 
warm water over them to rinse them. Parboil the onions for five 
minutes, then immerse them in cold water, and when refreshed 
drain them also into the colander. When dry, put the ODions, 
-cucumbers, peppers and cauliflowers in a copper basin. Dilute in 
a pint of lukewarm water eight ounces of mustard flour, to which 
add a teaspoonful of cayenne pepper and three ounces of tumeric. To 
this add enough of either cider or wine vinegar to cover the 
vegetables. Then set them on the fire and let them simmer until 
tender (if desired a little sugar may be added while cooking). 
When tender take them off of the fire, put them in an earthen bowl, 
and when they are cold put them in wide-mouthed bottles and cork 
tightly.

newly burned pine lands. It has a branching, purplish stem, and 
large oval-pointed entire leaves. The fruit consists of a flat, purple, 
juicy berry, which is sometimes used as a purple dye. The annual 
Phytolacca is less vigorous and stocky. Sow the seeds in April, in 
drills, fifteen inches apart. The young shoots are boiled and 
served the same as sea kale. In taste it is similar to asparagus. 
The roots are used for medicinal purposes, and when taken 
internally act as a violent emetic.

roundish, of a dark bluisli-green color, wrinkled on tlie surface and 
slightly undulating on the borders. The midrib of the leaf is large, 
thick, nearly white, and branches into veins. It forms a loose head 
and when full grown is nearly two feet high. Different parts of the 
Cabbage are used for culinary purposes. The ribs of the outer and 
large leaves, when boiled, somewhat resemble the sea-kale, both in 
texture and flavor. The heart, or middle, of the plant is, however, 
the best for use, as it is delicate and agreeably flavored, being 
without any of the coarseness often found in the common Cabbage. 
It is cultivated in the same manner as the common Cabbage. See

Fremcli POTATOES. German 

Pomme de terre. Kartoffeln. 

No. 1132. — The Potato is an esculent and farinaceous plant, and a 
native of South America. In its wild, natural state, the tuber rarely 
exceeds an inch in diameter, and is comparativeh^ unpalatable, 
but owing to cultivation they have greatly increased both in size 
and variety. There are over tAvo hundred varieties, some of which 
are far superior to others, much depending on the culture and the 
soil in which they are grown. They are considered the most impor- 
tant of all the esculent roots, and a valuable article of human subsist- 
ence. The Potato is a healthful and nourishing vegetable, being- 
agreeable to most all constitutions. It can be obtained throughout 
the year, and may be prepared without much trouble. The Potato 
is also used for other preparations. The Potato flour (fecula) is 
used by invalids and confectioners, and is mixed into the prepara- 
tions of the common sorts of chocolate. The Potato blossom is 
used in making paint, and the leaves when dried are used by tobac- 
conists. 

CULTURE. 

No. 1133. — The soil best suited for the Potato is of the drier and 
lighter description; pasture land or new land with the turf freshly 
turned, producing the most abundant as well as the most certain 
crop. When grown in land of a stifli" clayish texture, or in wet soils, 
they are not only extremely liable to disease, but the quality is also 
very inferior. If the soil is good but little manure will be required. 
In highly enriched soil the plants appear to be more liable to dis- 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE. 263 

ease than when grown in soil that is naturally good. The best 
fertilizers are those of a dry or absorbent nature, such as plaster 
lime, superphosphate of lime, and bone dust. For wet soil these 
are particularly beneficial, as they not only promote growth, but 
prevent disease. The Potato is propagated from tubers, which are 
either divided into sets, or planted entire. Whichever practice 
may be adopted, experience has proven that plants from well ripened 
tubers are not only more healthful and more productive, but actually 
come to perfection earlier than those produced from immature sets. 
Potatoes are usually planted either in hills or ridges, the former 
method being the most common in this country. If planted in hills 
they should be made three feet apart, on light warm soil. They 
require covering nearly four inches deep, but in cold, wet situations 
two and a half inches will be sufficient. Cultivation should be 
commenced as soon as the young shoots are fairly above the surface, 
^nd as the season advances gather the earth gradually about the 
hills or long drills, adding a little at each successive hoeing for the 
support of the growing plants, and to encourage the development 
of the rich roots, for it is at the extremity of the roots that the 
tubers are found. After the appearance of the blossoms cultivation 
should be discontinued, and no further attention will be required 
until ' the time for harvesting. The season of maturity of the 
earlier sorts will be indicated by the decay of the plants. The 
later sorts will continue their growth until checked by frost, pre- 
vious to which time they will not be ready for harvesting. New 
Potatoes may be had in the Southern States and in California in 
February and March, and in the Northern States as early as May 
or June, when the weather is practicable. 

The table should be supplied from day to day directly from the 
iield or garden, as the tubers rapidly deteriorate after being taken 
from the ground, especially if exposed to a warm, light atmosphere, 
or when kept in a warm, dry cellar. In the preservation of potatoes 
it is of the first importance that they be excluded from light (if this 
is neglected they become injured). Fermentation is also an im- 
portant evil to be guarded against, as it changes the whole substance 
of the Potato. Of the many old and new varieties that claim public 
favor the following are selected : 

EARLY MAYFLOWER. 

No. 1134. — Eipens very early, and in quality is claimed to be 
equal to the Snowflake. It is, in fact, a cross between the Snow- 
flake and Peachblow. The tubers are of medium size and run very 
uniform, being slightly flattened, oval shaped, and of a light lemon 
color. The skin is well covered with very fine netting, and has 



264 HARDEE'S AMERICAN COOKERY. 

very few eyes. The flesh is white and solid. It cooks evenly and 
thoroughly, without falling to pieces, and has no hard core, so com- 
mon to other sorts. 

wall's ORANGE. 

No. 1135. — Unsurpassed as a table variety. Its color is very 
distinct, being of a decided orange hue, from which it derives its 
name. It is unequaled in quality and productiveness, and one of 
the strongest growers. 

JUMBO. 

No. 1136. — This is one of the largest growing Potatoes in cultiva- 
tion, being at least one-third larger than the Peerless. It seems to 
be entirely free from rot and is one of the very best keepers. The 
tubers are nearly round, the skin white, the eyes small and sunken 
and the flesh white and of excellent flavor. Either baked or boiled 
they are dry and mealy. 

CHAMPION OF AMERICA. 

No. 1137. — The tubers are flesh-colored and the eyes carmine, 
small and even with the surface. It grows to an immense size on 
strong ground, producing tubers as heavy as three pounds in weight. 
It is a tremendous yielder, one of the best of keepers, and is not to 
be excelled for cooking purposes. 

ROCHESTER FAVORITE. 

No. 1138. — A late variety that is white, oval-oblong and very 
uniform in size. An immense yielder and a handsome variety, 
excellent for table use. 

SAINT PATRICK. 

No. 1139. — A handsome, smooth and regular variety, with very 
few and shallow eyes. A large yielder and of the best quality; 
excellent either baked or broiled being dry and mealy. 

BEAUTY OF HEBRON. 

No. 1140. — One of the best early sorts with white skin and flesh. 
A good keeper, excellent for table use, either baked or boiled. 

EARLY ROSE. 

No. 1141. — The leading variety for earliness, quality and pro- 
ductiveness. 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE, 265 

WHITE EOSE. 

No. 1142. — A second early variety of medium size, very uniform 
and finely formed, with wliite skin slightly russeted. 

LATE EOSE. 

No. 1143. — The best of the late varieties. 

PEEELESS. 

No. 1144. — A favorite variety for general use. 

SNOWFLAKE. 

No. 1145. — A variety of medium earliness and unsurpassed for 
mealiness and delicacy of flavor. 

EAELY TELEPHONE. 

No. 1146. — One of the best yielders, producing from one planted 
tuber as many as thirty or forty of good quality. 

YEEMONT CHAMPION. 

No. 1147. — Grows to an immense size; of fine shape and a good 
yielder. 

PEACH BLOW. 

No. 1148. This variety is well known, as it is planted in immense 
quantities all over the country. It is very productive and ripens 
about the same time as the Burbank. The tubers are of medium 
size, oval-oblong, and very handsomely formed. A good keeper, 
and one of the very best for transportation. 

MAMMOTH PEAEL. 

No. 1149. — The skin is white, the tubers medium in size, and the 
eyes are quite even with the surface. An excellent variety for 
table use, being exceedingly floury and well flavored. 

EAELY GEM. 

No. 1150. — One of'|the best early Potatoes, of medium size, oval- 
oblong in form and very smooth. The eyes are shallow and few in 



"266 haedee's ameeican cookeey. 

number. It cooks well and lias white and exceedingly mealy 
flesh. 

CAETEE. 

No. 1151. — A medium sized, round, flattened white Potato, and 
•one of the finest varieties, with numerous deeply sunk eyes. The 
flesh is white, remarkably dry, farinaceous and well-flavored. 

BUCKEYE. 

No. 1152. — A handsome round Potato, with a little bright pink at 
the bottom of the eyes. It is grown to a considerable extent in the 
Western States. It cooks dry and light, and is well flavored when 
grown for early use. When grown" for a late crop, in rich ground, 
many of the tubers are liable to be hollow in consequence of their 
rapid growth, thus impairing their value for table use. 

CALIFOENIA EED. 

No. 1153. — A bright red Potato, having tubers that vary in form 
from long to nearly round. One of the most productive of all the 
varieties, but its liability to disease accounts for it not being gen- 
erally cultivated. 

BOILED POTATOES. 

No. 1154. — Wash the Potatoes in cold water and remove all the 
small particles attached to them. Then put them into a saucepan 
with water to cover, add a little salt, put on the cover and set them 
on a brisk fire to bring them to a boil. Then set them on the side 
of the fire to let them boil moderately. As soon as they are done 
drain off the water, replace the cover tightly and set the Potatoes 
on the stove again for five minutes to dry them. If the Potatoes 
are good the flesh will be dry, white and mealy. Serve them in a 
napkin. 

Note. —Do not let Potatoes boil too quick, nor let them remain in tbe water after they have been 
boiled. 

BOILED PEELED POTATOES. 

No. 1155. — Peel the Potatoes and wash them in cold water (have 
ihem as near alike in size as possible). Put them into a saucepan, 
three-quarters full of cold water, add a little salt, put on the cover 
and boil them as in No. 1154. When done drain off' the water and 
<30ver the Potatoes with a napkin. Then put on the cover, set them 
back on the stove, and when dried serve them in a napkin or with 
melted butter.

BOILED NEW POTATOES. 

No. 1156. — New Potatoes need not be peeled. Wash them in 
cold water, then rub them with a coarse towel and the skin will 
come off. Put them into a saucepan three-quarters full of cold 
water, add a little salt and boil them as in No. 1154. When done 
drain them and serve with melted butter or Cream sauce over them. 

BOILED POTATOES, GERMAN STYLE. 

No. 1157. — Boil two dozen peeled Potatoes, and when they are 
done dish them up with the following preparation over them: Put 
into a frying pan two ounces of butter and one finely chopped onion. 
Fry the onion to a light brown color and add a little fresh bread 
crumbs. Toss this over a brisk fire, and when browned pour it 
over the Potatoes. 

STEAMED POTATOES. 

No. 1158. — steamed Potatoes are preferred by some to boiled 
Potatoes, and those that are not of the best quality will be found 
better when steamed than boiled. Have a small boiler three-quarters 
full of water. When the water boils set on top of this boiler an- 
other one with perforated holes in the bottom, and into this put the 
Potatoes; adding a little salt to them. Cover them tightly with a 
perforated cover. "When the steam comes through freely the Pota- 
toes will be done. Serve them in the same way as boiled Potatoes. 
Where vegetables are cooked by steam power, perforated baskets 
are made to fit the boilers, and in this case the faucets must be left 
open so that no water can accumulate in the boiler. 

STEWED POTATOES, AMERICAN STYLE. 

No. 1159. — Take one dozen boiled Potatoes and peel them (when 
of mediunj size cut them in halves, and when large cut them into 
quarters). Then slice them in pieces all alike a quarter of an inch

POTATO FLOUR (FECULE). 

No. 1203. — This can be obtained from all first-class grocers, and 
is used the same as arrowroot for invalids, and also in making 
griddle cakes, soups, custards, etc. Should necessity require it, 
the following recipe will be found very useful for making it in small 
quantities. 

Peel and wash one dozen white farinaceous Potatoes, and rub 
them through a fine hair sieve into a basin of cold water, keeping 
the Potato always moist with water. Then set the basin aside to

THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE. 279 

and season with salt, pepper and nutmeg. Mix tliem well together 
with a wooden spoon, and moisten them with a cup of milk. Then 
add the j^olks of five raw eggs, mixing them well with the Potatoes, 
butter the border moulds with clarified butter, fill them carefully 
with the Potatoes, smooth the tops, and put them in the oven to 
bake for fifteen minutes. Then take them out of the oven and let 
them cool for fifteen minutes. Then pass the blade of a knife 
between the Potatoes and the mould, turn the borders on a dish 
and remove the mould carefully. Then brush the borders with the 
yolk of an egg, diluted with a few drops of water. Put them back 
in the oven for a few minutes to get brown, and fill the center with 
the preparation intended for the border, which will be described 
hereafter. 

Note.— They may also be made by sprinkling the moulds with bread crumbs after they are 
"buttered. When prepared in this manner, bake them for twenty minutes and they will be ready to 
serve. When making the Potato borders by hand prepare the Potatoes as above, then put them 
on a floured table and shape them in rolls long enough to border the dish. Have the border about 
two inches thick. Cut a carrot diagonally, dip it in flour and then make an impression in the border 
with it, or various diiJerent designs can be impressed on the top. In this way the borders can be 
made more attractive than when made in mould. Brush the borders with the yolks of eggs diluted 
with a little water, wipe the edges clean and set them in the oven for a few minutes to get nicely 
colored. 

POTATO CRUSTS. 

No. 1208. — Prepare the Potatoes as in No. 1185. Then put 
them into a buttered square tin pan (having them an inch and a half 
thick), smooth the top evenly and cover it with a buttered paper. 
Then set them aside to cool. When cold turn them out on the 
table, and with a round cutter (the size of a dollar) cut them out. 
Roll them in fresh bread crumbs, then dip them in beaten eggs and 
bread them again. Form them nicely, and with a cutter (the size 
of a twenty-five cent piece) make an impression on the tops to mark 
the cover. Fry them in hot lard, and when nicely colored drain 
them, and in a few minutes remove the cover and scoop out the 
center, being careful not to injure the shell. Then fill them with 
the desired garniture, after which they take their name. 

Note. — Potatoes in this style are often called Timbals and Pates. 

POTATO SALAD. 

No. 1209. — Boil some Potatoes, slice them finely and fill a soup 
plate with them. Add some sweet oil, vinegar, salt, pepper, a few

wine. Cover the bowl and set it aside for one hour. Then season 
with salt, pepper, oil and vinegar, arrange it properly and garnish 
with water cress. 

POTATO SALAD, BENNETT STYLE. 

No. 1212. — Cut the Potatoes as in No. 1211, and put them in a 
salad bowl with four or six finely sliced gherkins. Rub the yolks of 
two hard boiled eggs through a fine sieve, put them in a bowl and 
add a tea-spoonful of mustard flour and one of anchovie paste, some 
salt, pepper and finely chopped chervil. Dilute this with oil 
and vinegar, mix them well and then add the Potatoes. Arrange 
them nicely in a salad bowl and garnish with hard boiled eggs cut 
in halves, and some sliced truffles that have been cooked in Madeira 
wine. 

POTATO SALAD, WITH ASPIC JELLY, CHAETEEUSE. 

No. 1213. — Boil two dozen firm, solid Potatoes; those that are 
mealy will not do for this recipe. They must be thoroughly cooked 
and then cooled. Then trim them into pieces about one or one-half 
of an inch thick, and after this cut them with a round column cut- 
ter, obtaining as many perfect pieces as possible. Put them on a 
napkin. Have some broken ice in a pan and put the mould in it 
that you intend filling. Line the mould with a coating of Aspic 
Jelly and decorate the bottom with the whites of hard boiled eggs 
and some capers and olives in the shape of a rosette. Then dip the 
small round pieces of Potato in Aspic jelly and arrange them nicely 
around the inside of the mould close together, to form a solid wall. 
(They may be alternated with sliced beets or gherkins.) When 
this is done, line the inside again with Aspic jelly to fill up the in- 
terstices. 

Now cut some hard boiled eggs in fine slices, place them in the 
bottom of the mould over the rosette, and put over this a few thin 
slices of beef tongue and some capers. Pour a little Aspic jelly 
over it to keep it firm. 

Cut some cold boiled Potatoes in thin square pieces and put them 
in a salad bowl. Add to it one-quarter of its quantity of boned sar- 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE. 281 

dines, cut in small pieces, and a few capers. Now make a Mayon- 
naise dressing with Aspic jelly (see Book on Sauces). Season it 
highly. Mix it with the Potatoes quickly, before the dressing be- 
comes hard, and put the mixture in the mould to fill it. Then 
smooth off the surface evenly and keep the mould in a cool place 
until ready to use it. When ready to serve it, dip the mould in 
lukewarm water, dry it with a napkin, turn it over on a dish and 
remove the mould carefully. 

Note.— This can be garnisbed with a variety of vegetables, and its success depends altogether 
Tipon the care taken iu preparing it. It may be filled with mixed vegetables, but they must be dried 
thoroughly before using. Care must be taken in making the Aspic Mayonnaise, which should be 
seasoned well. Only fresh and tender vegetables should be used.

ends. The plant may be cut for use when about five inches high, 
and is pickled, or may be boiled tlie same way as spinach. 

COMMON PURSLAIN. 

No. 1225. — This kind grows abundantly in gardens and cultivated 
fields. The green and the golden Purslain are improved sub- 
varieties, and though considered more succulent than the common 
Purslain, they will hardly repay one for the trouble of cultivating 
them, the difference in quality being very slight. The common 
variety is the kind in general use. Sow it in shallow drills, at any 
time from April to July. It thrives well in any soil.

culture. 

No. 1227. — A Avarm, sandy loam, made rich and light by 
well rotted manure, with a liberal dressing of salt, will keep them 
free from worms. Sow the seed in twelve inch drills as early as the 
ground can be worked, once in two weeks for a succession of crops. 
Thin them to two inches apart as soon as the raw leaves appear. 
Kadishes must have plenty of room and should be grown quickly 
or they will invariably be tough and wormy. 

SPRING AND SUMMER RADISHES.

on the roadsides in this country. The roots, which are the only 
parts used, are, when full grown, about ten inches long, of fusiform, 
and have strong fibres. The whitish, thick outer skin peels off 
readily, and should always be removed. It has a nutty flavor when 
eaten raw, and is inferior to the true Eampion, being slightly pun- 
gent in taste. They are used in salads when young, and are pre- 
pared in the same manner as the oyster plant, when full grown. 

EAMPION SALAD.

RHUBARB. 

Rhuharhe. Rhaharher. 

No. 1269.— Ehubarb is a perennial plant, and is cultivated almost 
exclusively for its leaf stalks. The root leaves are large, round, 
heart-shaped, and deep green in color, being more or less blistered. 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE. 291 

The leaf stalks are large, fniTOwed, succulent, and of a pale green 
color, often stained or finely spotted with red, and varying from 
two to three inches in diameter at the broadest part, and from one 
to three feet in length. The stalks are used for pies, tarts, jellies, 
and for various medicinal purposes. The juice makes a tolerably 
palatable wine. 

CULTUEE. 

No. 1270. — Khubarb succeeds best in deep, and somewhat re- 
tentive soil; the richer its condition, and the deeper it is stirred, 
the better. Sow the seeds in drills, cover them with one inch of 
soil, and thin out the plants to six inches apart. Trench a piece of 
ground in the fall, manure it well, and transplant the young plants 
in the trench, three feet apart each way. Cover them with leaves 
during the first winter, and give them a dressing of coarse manure 
every fall. The stalks should not be plucked until the third year 
and the plant should never be allowed to run to seed. Seeds can 
never be relied upon to produce the same variety. The A^arieties 
are quite numerous, but those of good quality are limited in number. 

downing' S COLOSSAL. 

No. 1271. — This is one of the best and largest varieties, having a 
fine, rich, aromatic flavor. Stalks of medium size are the best for 
.family use. They turn red when cooking. When stewed it 
resembles currant jelly in color. 

ELFORD. 

No. 1272. — An early sort with slender stalks that are covered 
with a thin bright scarlet colored skin. The flesh is of a reddish 
color, which is retained when cooked, if 'the skin is not peeled ofl*, a 
process which is unnecessary/. 

hawk's CHAMPAGNE. 

No. 1273. — A variety as eaily as the Prince Albert, of a deeper 
and finer color, but more productive and larger. 

wyatt's linneous. 

No. 1274. — A medium sized, very early and productive variety, 
that is highly flavored and but slightly aciduous. The skin is thin 
and the flesh tender.

WYATT S VICTORIA. 



No. 1275. — A productive variety, with large leaf -stalks, about 
three inches broad and over two feet long. They are reddish at 
the base and are often finely spotted with red to the nerves of the 
leaves. The skin is thick and the flesh is not very highly flavored. 

CAHOON. 

No. 1276. — The stalks are short and thick, the skin being thick 
and green. The texture is coarse and the flavor harsh and strong. 
It is seldom cultivated for culinary purposes, being used princi- 
pally in the manufacture of wine. The juice is pressed from the 
stalks, and to each gallon three and a half pounds of sugar is 
added. The wine is quite palatable, but lacks the fine aroma of 
grape wine. Any of the other varieties may be used for wine, 
sugar being added according to their sweetness. 

RHUBARB WINE. 

No. 1277. — Cut half a pound of Ehubarb roots into small pieces, 
put them in an earthen jar, and moisten them with one quart of 
wine spirits (alcohol). Six days later add one gallon of dry white 
wine to it and cover the jar tightly. Ten days later filter it and put 
it into bottles. A wine-glassful taken every morning before break- 
fast is said to be very healthful. 

RHUBARB WATER. 

No. 1278. — Cut six ounces of Ehubarb roots into small pieces, put 
them in a quart bottle, fill the bottle with water, and set it aside for 
three days. The water diminishes phlegm, strengthens the stomach, 
and facilitates digestion. Take a wine-glassful at dinner time and 
mis it with wine. Ee-fill the bottle when any is taken out and 
renew the quantity of Ehubarb roots every two weeks. 

STEWED RHUBARB. 

No. 1279. — stewed Rhubarb is used as a relish and for pies and 
tarts. Peel and cut two pounds of Ehubarb into pieces about an 
inch long, parboil them for two minutes, then drain and put them 
into a saucepan, with four spoonfuls of cold water, and set it on a 
brisk fire, occasionally stirring it with a wooden spoon. When 
nearly cooked, sweeten it to taste, and let it cook until tender. 

Note. — When cooked to be served as a relish, the pieces should be kept -whole, and in order to do 
this it is only necessary to be a little more careful in cooking them and not stir them too much. 
Rhubarb, after being cooked, must always be kept in an earthen bowl or jar and covered with paper.

No. 1280. — Eice is a native of the Orient, where it is a staple 
food. The best and finest quality is now grown in South Carolina. 
After bread it is the most healthful nourishment known. It is pre- 
pared for food in many different ways as a vegetable, and is exten- 
sively used, when ground into a flour, by pastry cooks for puddings, 
creams, cakes, etc., which will be described in the Book on Pastry. 
In China an intoxicating wine is made from it. In selecting Rice 
care should be taken to see that the grains are whole, for when they 
are broken, or the Rice is of inferior quality, it cannot be prepared 
properly. When it is properly cooked the grains should remain 
entire, and should not stick together. There is but one species. 
The plant is cultivated in warm climates in America, and grows best 
in low, moist soil, which can be overflowed. It is a light, nutritious 
food, and is easily digested. 

BOILED EICE, PLAIN.

and a half times its depth. Season with salt, cover the saucepan 
and set it on the fire. As soon as it boils set it on the side of the 
fire, let it boil slowly for twenty minutes, and then the Rice will be 
cooked dry. Then add sis ounces of butter, divided into small 
pieces, and a pinch of nutmeg, and mix them gently with a wooden 
spoon. Eice cooked in this way is used for garnitures, borders, 
Timbals, soups, etc. 

RICE BORDERS. 

No. 1285.— Cook the Rice as in Nos. 1282 and 1284. Then butter a 
border mould with clarified butter, press the Eice into it around the 
sides and bottom tightly, leaving a space in the center. Smooth it 
nicely on top, cover it with a buttered paper cover, and set the 
mould in a moderate oven for fifteen minutes. Then take it out, 
set it on the dish it is to be served on, and in five minutes lift off 
the mould carefully. Then fill the center of the border with the 
preparation intended for it. 

jfoTE. — When Eice is used for garnishing side dishes, it may be moulded in a Charlotte movild, 
or in a deep kitchen spoon. For the latter style dip the spoon in warm water, fill it with Kice, then 
gently press the Rice into an oval shape in the spoon. Then place the Eice on the diah that is to be 
garnished. 

RICE EOR PUREES OR BISQUE SOUPS.

to harden. (They may also be decorated with trufiies, beef tongue 
or raspings of bread.) When the Rice is cool and the moulds are 
ready, line the moulds carefully with it, pressing it tightly together 
around the sides and bottom, but being careful not to disturb the 
decorations. Fill the centres with a garniture of meats or purees. 
(The Timbal is named after the garniture it is filled with. ) Then 
cover the Timbals with a layer of Eice, smooth it evenly, and cover 
it with a buttered paper cover. Then set them in the oven to keep 
warm until ready for use. When ready to serve them, pass a knife 
between the mould and the Timbal to loosen it, and then turn it on 
to the dish it is to be served on. 

JTOTB. — When making large Timbals, tbe Rice should be from one-half to three-quarters of an 
inch thick in the mould; for small garnitures, from one-quarter to one-half of an inch will be 
sulficient.

No. 1323. — Wash one pound of Rice in cold water, parboil it for 
iwo minutes, immerse it in cold water, and drain it in a sieve. 
Then put it in a saucepan, and pour twice as much boiling milk 
over it as there is Rice. Cover the saucepan and let it cook slowly 
until the Rice is cooked dry. Then take it off of the fire to get 
cool; after which add two ounces of butter, three ounces of grated 
Parmesan cheese, the yolks of sis raw eggs, a pinch of salt and one 
of nutmeg. Mis the whole well together. Put some clarified 
butter in a frying-pan, and drop into it a tablespoonful of Rice in a

EICE FOE COMPOTES OP FEUIT. 

No. 1328. — Wash one pound of Rice in cold water, and drain it. 
Then put it in a saucepan with three quarts of boiled milk, stirring 
it until it boils. Then add the peelings of one lemon and a stick 
of cinnamon. Cover the saucepan and let it cook slowly. When 
the Rice is three-quarters cooked, sweeten it to taste, and, should it 
be too thick, add a little more milk. When it is done keep it warm 
for use. When the fruit is cooked as for Compotes, dish up the 
Rice, and garnish it with the fruit intended to be served with it. 

Note.— For fuU description of Compotes, see the Book on Pastry.

and half a teaspoonful of ground cinnamon. Then add three pints 
of fresh milk, cover the saucepan tight and set it in a hot oven to 
cook for forty-five minutes. 

Note. — Care must be taken to have the saucepan high enovigh to prevent the milk from running 
over, as when the milk rises it should fall back to the Rice. This is light, agreeable, nourishing and 
healthful for persons having inflammation of the chest or stomach. 



EICE CRUSTS, OK STANDS FOE HOT OE COLD SIDE DISHES. 

No. 1330. — Crusts upon which side dishes are dressed, are gen- 
erally cut from bread and are formed in various shapes, but those 
of Rice will be found much better and more secure, as - they are 
very firm and will not soften like the bread, especially when the 
dish to be served must remain on the table for some time. Besides 
this, the whiteness of the Rice, when the crust is well made, presents 
a much more jDleasing effect than the bread. This will be found 
to be the case, especiallj^ in cold dishes, owing to the fact that the 
Rice can be cut or carved into any shape after it has been moulded, 
but it requires experience and practice to shape them nicely. 

HOW TO COOK EICE EOR CEUSTS OE STANDS. 

No. 1331. — Wash four pounds of Rice in plenty of cold water and 
drain it. Then put it in a saucepan and pour over it three times 
as much water as there is Rice. Add a little salt and a small piece 
of butter and set it on the fire to boil, stirring it well. Six minutes 
after this, put the cover on the pan tightly, and set in a moderate 
oven for one hour, when the rice will be cooked dry. (If any of the 
Rice on top has become browned, remove it.) Then take the Rice 
from the saucepan with a spoon, being careful not to remove any 
that adheres to the side or bottom of the pan. Put it in a mortar, 
pound it to a fine paste and put it on a clean table board. Then 
dip your hands in cold water and work the Rice well together. 
Then butter a mould of the desired shape, fill it with the Rice, and 
smooth the surface evenly. Put a buttered paper cover on top, and 
on this place a wooden cover that will fit inside of the mould. A 
heavy weight must be put on the board to press the Rice down 
solid. Then set it aside for ten hours to get cold, and, when ready 
to use it, dip the mould in hot water and turn, the Rice out on a dish. 
Then cut the Rice into any shape desired with a small sharp knife, 
and keep it covered with a damp napkin until wanted.

FrencJi SAFFRON. German 

Safran. Saffraji^ 

No. 1352. — The common cultivated Saffron is a perennial plant. 
It is cultivated for its ilowers, which are large, of a beautiful lilac 
color, and are used in dyeing, and to make the cosmetic called 
Eouge. The Saffron has been known for ages in Greece and Asia 
Minor. There are several different varieties. The French Saffron 
is much superior in color, and the Spanish is the best in flavor. 
The Saffron is cultivated in the United States as a garden flower 
only. The flowers are gathered after they show themselves, as their 
period of flowering is very short. The stigmas, or summits of the 
petals, with a portion of the style, are separated from the remain- 
der of the flower, and are carefully dried by aitificial heat, or in the 
sun. During this process they are made into the form of a cake, 
by pressure; but the finest Spanish Saffron is dried loosely. They 
are distinguished by the name of cake, or hay-Saffron. It must be 
kept in a dry place, in well-stopped vessels. Saffron has a peculiar 
aromatic odor, a warm, pungent, bitter taste, and a rich, deep 
orange color. When soaked in water it colors the liquid an orange- 
yellow color. It is much used in the Spanish and Southern coun- 
tries for culinary purposes, for flavoring soups and rice dishes, and 
also by confectioners, and for medicinal purposes. From the seed 
a fixed oil is obtained somewhat similar to that of the sunflower. 
On account of the high price of the Spanish Saffron it is adulterated 
frequently. The flowers of other plants, such as safflower, marigold 
and arnica, are mixed with the genuine stigmas. They may be de- 
tected by their shape, which is rendered obvious by putting a 
portion of the so-called Saffron in hot water, which will cause them 
to expand. Much of this is to be found in the United States, and is 
sold under the name of African Saffron. Other adulterations are 
made with yellow-colored chalk, or sulphate of barrium, made into 
a thin paste, probably with honey, and attached to stigmas. The 
pure Saffron will always be clear when diluted with water, assuming 
a fine pure yellow tint, and the Saffron its red color. Less than the 
ordinary brightness of color in the Saffron should lead to the sus- 
picion of adulteration. Saffron should not be very moist nor dry. 
The freshest is the best and should not be over a year old. When 
it is put in acidulated water it should color it bright yellow.

YELLOW COLOKING FOR CULINAEY PURPOSES. 

No. 1353. — To a quarter of a pound of Saffron add a pint of water 
and one ounce of alum. Let it boil for fifteen minutes, then strain 
it tlirough a towel and put it into bottles. When it is cold, cork 
the bottles tightly.

Satige. Salbei- 

No. 1354. — This is a hardy, perennial plant, possessing some 
medicinal properties. It is cultivated principally for use as a condi- 
ment, and is used more extensively than any other herb, both green 
and in a dried state, for seasoning stuffings, meats, stews and soups. 
It is also used for flavoring cheese, and, in the form of a decoction, 
is sometimes employed for medicinal purposes. It should be gath- 
ered for drying before the development of the flowering shoots; 
and when cultivated for its leaves, the shoots should be cut ofl" as 
they make their appearance. The product will be largely increased, 
as the leaves are put forth in much greater numbers and attain 
larger size. 

CULTURE. 

No. 1355. — Sow it early in spring, in very rich ground. Cultivate 
it often and thin the plants to sixteen inches apart. The plants 
will survive the winter, and, if divided, will give a second crop 
superior to the first in qualit}". 

BROAD-LEAVED GREEN SAGE. 

No. 1356. — The stem is shrubby, and the leaves are large, broad 
and heart-shaped, woolly, toothed on the margin, and produced on 
long foot-stalks. It is rarely employed for cooking purposes, but 
for medicinal purposes it is considered better than any other sort.

French SAGO. German 

Sagou, Sago. 

No. 1361. — Sago is a dry, granulated starch that is imported from 
the East Indies. It is the prepared pith of the Sago and other 
palms. Numerous trees in the East Indies and on the coast of the 
Indian Ocean, contain a farinaceous pith which is prepared for 
nutriment by the natives. The Sago Palm is one of the smallest, 
its height seldom exceeding thirty feet. The trunk is thick, erect 
and cylindrical, and is covered with a beautiful crown of foliage, of 
large, pinniate leaves, extending in all directions from the summit ' 
and curving gracefully downwards. The medullary matter contains 
most of the starch. When the large leaves have fallen off and the 
flowers commence to take their place, the tree is felled and the 
trunk is cut into billets about six feet long, which are then split to 
facilitate the extraction of the pith, which is obtained in the state 
of a coarse powder. This is mixed with water in a trough having 
a strainer at the end. The water, loaded with farina, passes through 
the strainer and is received in convenient vessels, where it is 
allowed to stand until it has settled. It is then drained off and the 
farina is dried and formed into cakes by the natives. The Sago as 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE. 315 

sold here is prepared by formiug the meal into a paste with water, 
and rubbing it into grains. This is produced in the greatest 
abundance in the Moluccas, but the finest quality comes from the 
Eastern coast of Sumatra, in Malacca and Singapore. It is refined 
so as to give the grains a fine pearly lustre. This is what is called 
Pearl Sago, which is the kind generally used. It is a small 
grain about the size of a pin-head. The common Sago is larger, and 
the grains are of a more unequal size and of a duller aspect, being 
mixed with more or less dirty looking powder. Sago is used as an 
article of diet, being nutritive and digestible, and wholly destitute 
of irritating properties. 

SAGO FOE INVALIDS. 

No. 1362. — In its preparation care must be taken to boil it long 
in water or broth. Drop it into boiling water or broth while 
stirring it, so the grains will dissolve thoroughly and not form in 
lumps. Should any portion not be dissolved it must be strained, 
as it might ofiiend a delicate stomach. A table-spoonful of Sago 
to a pint of water is sufficient for ordinary purposes. It may be 
seasoned with sugar, nutmeg or other spices, and wine may be 
added if advisable. 

SAGO GEUEL. 

No. 1363. — Boil one quart of water in a saucepan and then drop 
in three spoonfuls of Sago slowly, while stirring it with a wooden 
spoon. When it boils steadily, set it on the side of the fire to boil 
slowly and add a pinch of salt. In three-quarters of an hour add 
a wine-glassful of good white wine, the juice of one lemon, a soup- 
spoonful of powdered sugar and a pinch of nutmeg. Serve it hot 
or put it in an earthen bowl and serve it when cold. 

SAGO FOR SOUPS. 

No. 1364. — Drop the amount of Sago necessary in boiling broth, 
or consomme, stirring it until it boils steadily. Sago is added to 
many purees and cream soups as a garniture. Sago or tapioca with 
chicken or veal broth, is partaken of in the morning by prima donnas 
to a considerable extent. 

SAGO SOUP WITH CREAM. 

No. 1365. — Wash the Sago in cold water, then drop it in a sauce- 
pan containing one quart of chicken broth, and let it boil slowly 
until well cooked. Then season it lightly and add half a pint of 
cream diluted with the yolks of two raw eggs, which will render it

SALSIFY, OR OYSTER PLANT. 

Scdsifis. Haferiuurz L 

No. 1367. — Salsify is a hardy biennial plant, and is principally 
.cultivated for its roots, the flavor of which resembles that of oysters. 
The leaves are long and grass-like. The roots are long and tapering, 
like the parsnip, and when grown in good soil measure about ten 
inches in length and an inch in diameter. Their flavor is sweet and 
delicate, and they are said to contain medicinal properties which 
have a tendency to alleviate consumption. 

CULTURE. 

No. 1368. — Salsify succeeds best in a light and well enriched soil, 
which should be worked to a depth of twelve inches. The manure 
should be well rotted, for when fresh and coarse the roots will grow 
irregular and ill-shaped. Sow early and quite deep, and give the 
same general culture as for parsnips. The roots are hardy and may 
remain out all winter, but should be dug early in the spring as they 
deteriorate rapidly after growth commences. For winter use store 
them in the sand. 

HOW TO PREPARE IT FOR COOKING. 

No. 1369. — Scrape the skin off carefully and cut them in halves. 
Then slice them in sticks about two inches long, and throw them

Parina, Article LXXXVIII). The White Semoule is made from rice 
flour, and the yellow kind from wheat flour, to which a saffron dye 
is added, with some coriander and the yolks of eggs. The yellow 
Semoule is considered best and is much relished when boiled in milk 
and sweetened. Semoule is used for soups and a variety of culinary 
preparations, and is a good food for invalids. 

CONSOMME, WITH SEMOULE. 

No. 1403. — Put four quarts of Consomme in a saucepan, and 
when it boils add in slowly half a pound of Semoule, stirring it 
well so it will not get lumpy. Let it boil slowly for twenty min- 
utes, season to taste, then skim it and serve. 

Note. — A Consomme with farina, manioca, sago, tapioca, vermicelli, or any kind of paste may be 
jnade the same as the above and, by adding a little cream diluted with the yolks of eggs, it will be 
more nourishing. 

SMALL CEUSTS OF SEMOULE, PALERMITAINE. 

No. 1404. — Put three quarts of clear white broth in a saucepan, 
add a small piece of butter, season with salt and, when it boils, add 
in slowly two pounds of Semoule, stirring it gently, so it will not 
get lumpy. Then set it on the side of the fire to cook slowly until 
thoroughly cooked, keeping it firm. When done take it off of the 
fire and add two ounces of butter and six ounces of grated Parmesan 
cheese. Mix it well together and put it in a buttered square tin 
pan, having the mixture about one and a half inches deep. Smooth 
the surface evenly, cover it with a buttered paper cover and set it 
aside to get cold. Then turn it out on a table and, with a round 
cutter the size of a dollar, cut out as many pieces as possible. Roll 
them in fresh bread crumbs, dip them in beaten eggs, and then 
bread them again. Form them nicely in shape and, with a cutter 
the size of a twenty-five cent piece, make a slight impression on the 
top of each to mark the cover. Then fry them in hot lard and, 
when nicely browned, drain them and in a few minutes take off the 
cover and scoop out the center, being careful not to injure the crust. 
Keep them warm until ready for use. Then make a garniture of 
small boiled macaroni (spaghetti), cut in pieces a quarter of an inch 
long, mixed with the same quantity of small pieces of the breast of 
roasted quails or partridges, and an equal quantity of lean boiled 
ham and artichoke bottoms cut in small pieces. Put the garniture 
in a reduced Madeira wine sauce, add a few drops of lemon juice 
and mix it gently together. Then fill the crusts with the garniture 
and serve hot.

balls of semoule (quenelles,) villeroi. 

No. 1405. — Put one quart of milk in a saucepan and, when it boils, 
add in slowly three-quarters of a pound of Semoule, stirring it 
gently, so it will not get lumpy. Then set it on the side of the fire 
to cook slowly until it is thoroughly cooked, keeping it firm. Take 
it off of the fire, let it cool a little, then add a handful of grated Par- 
mesan cheese and the yolks of ten raw eggs, mixing it well, and 
season with salt and a pinch of nutmeg. Then let it get cool. 

Now cut some truffles, mushrooms and the breast of a roasted 
fowl, in a short Julienne, and add them to a succulent and well re- 
duced Madeira wine or Allemande sauce, and set it aside to get 
cold. 

Prepare some small, oblong granulated Tartlet moulds and butter 
them with clarified butter. Put in each mould a thin layer of 
Semoule and smooth it neatly with a knife, leaving the centre hol- 
low. Then fill them with the above garniture, cover the top with 
Semoule, allowing it to form on top in a semi-oval shape, and 
smooth it off neatly. Set them aside to get cold and firm. Then 
take them out of the moulds and dip them in a cool Villeroi sauce, 
place them in a pan side by side, and set the pan on the ice so 
the sauce will adhere to them. Then trim them nicely, roll them 
in fresh bread crumbs, dip them in beaten eggs and bread them 
again. (Handle them very carefully.) Now fry them in hot 
lard and, when nicely colored, drain them and serve them on a 
napkin.

French SHALLOT, OR ESCHALOT. Germait 

Echalote. Sehalotte. 

No. 1406. — The Shallot is a native of Palestine, and is used in 
the same manner as the onion, or garlic. The root of the plant is 
composed of several small bulbs united at the base, the whole being 
enclosed in a thin skin, varying in color in the different varieties. 
The ripening will be indicated by the decay of the leaves. After 
the bulbs are dried they should be stored in a light, dry situation. 
When exposed to frost or put in a damp cellar they rapidly decay. 
In flavor it is mild and pleasant, resembling the leek. They are 
prepared and cooked in the same manner as onions or garlic. 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE. 327 

CULTUEE. 

No. 1407. — The Shallot will thrive in any soil that is adapted to

Trench SIEVA, OR SMALL LIMA BEAN. German 

'Sieve (Petite Feve). Bohne. 

No. 1414. — The Sieva is a variety of the Lima Bean, the plant 
attaining a height of ten feet. The pods are small and uniform in 
size, generally about three inches long and seven inches wide. 
When young they are green and wrinkled, but when ripe they turn 
to a pale yellowish-brown. They are a little earlier than the Lima 
Bean, but require the whole season for their complete maturity. 
The seeds are white, or of a dull yellowish-white, broad and flat- 
tened. They are similar to the Lima Beans, and are almost as 
delicate and richly flavored. The young pods are hard and tough, 
and are never eaten. This is the most productive of all varieties. 

MOTTLED sieva. 

No. 1415. — A sub-variety of the Sieva, the only difference be- 
tween them being in the variegated character of the seeds, which 
are of a dull white color, spotted and streaked with purple.

No. 1419. — Sorrel is a hardy perennial plant. The species as 
well as the varieties differ to a considerable extent in height and 
.general habit, yet their usage is nearly the same. The finest roots 
are obtained from seedlings. These varieties are propagated by 
dividing the roots. This method must be adopted in the propaga- 
tion of the di vicious kinds when the male plants are required. All 
of the varieties will send up a flower-stalk in summer, and it is 
necessary to cut the stalk when it first develops in order to render 



330 HARDER'S AMERICAN COOKERY. 

the leaves larger and more tender. Sorrel is used for soups and 
purees, and is preserved for winter use. It is one of the most 
wholesome vegetables, and would be particularly beneficial to that 
class of the community that live much upon salt provisions. 

CULTURE. 

No. 1420. — Sorrel is cultivated easily, and may be grown in almost, 
any soil or situation, but thrives best in rich, moist soil. Sow it in

No. 1437. — Spearmint is a hardy perennial plant, and is generally 
cultivated in gardens, but grows naturally about springs of water, 
and in rich, wet localities. It may be grown from seed, but is 
propagated best by a division of the roots, which are long and creep- 
ing, and readily establish themselves wherever they are planted. 
The roots may be set either in autumn or spring. Spearmint is 
used mixed in salads and boiled with green peas, and with the ad- 
dition of sugar and vinegar forms a much esteemed relish for roasted 
lamb. The common Mint is superior to Spearmint for every 
purpose.

Frcuch SPICSS. Oernian 

Epice. Wilrze. 

No. 1438. — Spices are used to season, aromatize and enricli 
numerous culinary preparations. They are all vegetable substances 
witli the exception of salt. Their importance cannot be overesti- 
mated as they are used constantly, yet often wrongfully. The art 
of spicing or seasoning properly is one that must be acquired, and 
experience is the best teacher. Many preparations would be indi- 
gestible and almost tasteless without the use of spices. Salt is 
probably used most, and after it comes the onions, shallots, 
chives, and garlic. The onion is used principally as an 
alimentary substance, while the others may be considered 
energetic stimulants to the appetite. High seasoning is more in 
vogue in the Southern States and in all Avarm climates, than in the 
North. The French, as a rule, use less strong spices in cooking 
than any other nation, preferring aromatic herbs instead, which 
answer the same purpose and are less exciting. India furnishes the 
major portion of strong spices, such as mulligatawny, chutney, 
curry, etc. 

SPICES FOR SALTED BEEF. 

No. 1439. — Home-made spices are far superior to many of those 
bought from dealers, as the latter kinds are generally adulterated, 
and if not kept tightly corked lose their aromatic flavor by evap- 
oration. The following is the best recipe for making Spices for 
salted beef: Procure the following quantities of dried herbs: Two 
ounces each of thyme, sage, nutmeg, cloves, mace, and bay leaves; 
three ounces of white pepper, and one ounce each of marjoram and 
rosemary. Then pound each kind separately in a mortar and sift 
them through a fine sieve. Put the mixture in bottles and keep 
them tightly corked. When ready to use it add one ounce of the 
Spice to one pound of salt. 

SPICED SALT, FOR STUFFINGS. 

No. 1440. — Procure the following quantities of dried herbs: One- 
half of an ounce each of powdered thyme, cloves, nutmeg, white or 
black pepper, and one-quarter of an ounce each of powdered bay 
leaves, marjoram, and red pepper. Mix them with one and a half 
pounds of fine salt, then put them in bottles and keep them tightly 
corked. Use it for stuffing.

INFUSION OF SPICES FOR TURTLE SOUP. 

No. 1441. — Put a few fresh marjoram leaves in a saucepan and 
add equal quantities of thyme, basil, savory and parsley, with two 
bay leaves, three chopped shallots, and some trimmings of fresh 
mushrooms. (Dried mushrooms can be used if desired.) Then 
boil one pint of good Maderia wine and pour it over the herbs, etc. 
Cover the saucepan tightly, and in half an hour strain the infusion 
through a napkin and add it to a clear turtle soup. 

Note. — Should the turtle soup be thick iustead of clear, use powdered spices instead of leaves 
and add them to the stock. 

MIXED SPICES. 

No. 1442. — ^The following mixture of Spices will always be found 
useful in the kitchen. Procure the following quantities of ground 
Spices: Eight ounces of thyme, one ounce of bay leaves, half an 
ounce of marjoram, half an ounce of rosemary, one and a half ounces 
of nutmeg, one and a half ounces of cloves, one ounce of white 
pepper, and half an ounce of red pepper. Mix them well together, 
put them in bottles and keep them tightly corked. These Spices 
may be used as they are, or may be mixed with salt. Three ounces 
of Spice is the proper quantity for three-quarters of a pound of salt.

No. 1448. — Put in a bowl a teaspoonful of ground cloves, one 
ounce of Anchovy paste, half a teaspoonful of cayenne pepper, and 
a wine-glassful each "of walnut and tomato catchup (strained). Add 
to this one and a half quarts of white wine vinegar, and mix it well 
together. Then put it in an earthen jar, cover it, and set it in a

French SPINACH OR SPINAGE. German 

Epinard, Spinat. 

No. 1445. — Spinach is a hardy annual plant, and is said to be of 
Asiatic origin. The leaves and young stems are the only parts of 
the plant that are used, being extremely wholesome and palatable, 
and retaining their bright green color after being cooked. The 
leaves are smooth and oval-oblong shaped, though varying in the 
different varieties. Spinach is prepared in various ways and is. 
eaten with almost every kind of meat. The expressed juice is used 
to impart a greenish color to certain dishes. It affords but little 
nourishment, but when eaten freely, is mildly laxative, diuretic and 
cooling. 

CULTURE. 

No. 1446. — It should be planted in very rich ground. Sow it a 
foot apart, in drills, and commence thinning out the plants when 
the leaves are an inch wide. When they are two or three inches, 
wide, they will be fit to gather. This is done by cutting them up 
with a knife entirely to the bottom, or by only cropping the large 
outer leaves. The root and heart should remain to shoot out again 
according to the season. 



FLANDERS SPINACH. 

No. 1447. — This is a winter variety, and is considered superior to 
the Prickly Spinach which is in general cultivation during the 
winter season. The seeds are sown about the last of August, in 
drills one foot apart and nearly an inch deep. The Prickly-seeded 
Spinach is cultivated and used the same way as this variety. 

LETTUCE-LEAVED SPINACH.

Spinach prepared as in Nos. 1455, 1456 and 1457, is served as a. 
garniture for braised meats, entrees, or any kind of broiled or fried 
meat, especially veal and lamb. 

SPINACH FRITTERS (SUBRICS). 

Na. 1460. — Chop one quart of boiled Spinach 'finely and put it 
in a flat saucepan with four spoonfuls of Cream or Allemande sauce. 
Beduce it on a brisk fire and then set it on the side of the fire. 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE. 339 

Season with salt, pepper and nutmeg, and add a small piece of 
butter and the yolks of eight raw eggs. Mix the whole well to- 
gether and set it aside to get cold. Then put some clarified butter 
in a frying pan, and drop the Spinach into it, one spoonful at a 
time, and manage it so that they will not touch each other. Fry 
them nicely on both sides ; then serve them on a napkin and garnish 
with fried parsley. 

GEEEN COLOR OF SPINACH. 

No. 1461. — Pick, wash and drain five large handfuls of Spinach. 
Then put it in a mortar, pound it finely and add six glassfuls of 
cold water. After this, strain it through a towel, pressing it well 
to extract all of the moisture. Then put it in a saucepan on the 
fire, and just before it boils, set it on the side of the fire, keeping- 
it at the boiling heat, but not allowing it to boil. Then drain 
it in a fine hair sieve. That which remains in the sieve is used for 
coloring. 

Another way of making the green color is as follows : Throw 
three handfuls of Spinach in some boiling water, with a little pars- 
ley and chives. Let it remain there one minute; then immerse it 
in cold water, drain it, and press it dry. Then put it in a mortar, 
pound it finely, and rub it through a fine sieve. After this moisten 
it with a little cold white broth. 

CREAM OF SPINACH. 

No. 1462. — Put four soup-spoonfuls of finely-chopped cooked 
Spinach and one dozen sweet almonds in a mortar, and pound them 
into a fine paste. Then add four macaroons made with bitter 
almonds, and sweeten with sugar to taste. Pound the whole well, 
and then add a quart of cream and the yolks of ten raw eggs. Mix 
them well together and strain the mixture through a sieve. Put it 
in a small mould and cook it the same as a custard.

No. 1463. — The Squash is one of the most nutritious and valuable 
of all garden vegetables. The summer varieties appear early, and 



340 haedee's ameeican cookeey. 

are very palatable, while the winter sorts can be had in perfection 
in August. All of the varieties are tender annuals and thrive best 
in a warm temperature. 

cultuee. 

No. 1464. — Plant them in warm weather, and cultivate them 
generally as you would cucumbers or melons, being particular about 
the soil. The summer varieties should be planted six feet apart 
each way, and the winter varieties at a distance of eight feet. Three 
plants are sufficient for one hill. Care should be taken not to 
injure or break the stems of those intended for winter use, as the 
.slightest injury increases their liability to decay. 

SUMMER VARIETIES. 

APPLE SQUASH.

FrcEcl. SWEET POTATOES. German 

JPatate. B itaten. 

No. 1498. — The Sweet Potato is a native of the East and West 
-Indies, where it grows natural as a perennial plant, but when culti- 
vated it is always treated as an annual. They thrive well in the 
Southern States, but those grown in the North are much inferior, as 
the plants seldom blossom and the tubers never ripen perfectly. 
Though numerous varieties are cultivated, none can compare with 
ihose grown in the South. 

cultuee. 

No. 1499. — The Sweet Potato is cultivated much in the same 
manner as our common potato, and succeeds best in light warm soil, 
which should be deeply stirred and well enriched. The slips or 
sprouts are planted twelve inches apart in ridges that are four feet 
v^ide. Give the plants ordinary culture in the summer, and early 
in October the tubers will have attained their growth and will be 
ready for harvesting. The slips or sprouts are generally obtained 
by setting the tubers in a hot-bed in March and breaking oif the 
sprouts from them when they are five inches high. For transplant- 
ing in a favorable season the plucking may be repeated about four 
times. In setting out the slips the lower part should be sunk one- 
half of their depth, and when dry weather occurs water should be 
applied moderately. Dryness and a warm and even temperature are 
essential for the preservation of Sweet Potatoes, for if these condi- 
tions are not supplied the tubers will decay rapidly. They may be 
preserved until spring by packing them in dry sand and storing 
them in a warm dry room.

purposes. There are three varieties. The curled leaved Tansy 
differs from the common variety in its curled or frilled leaves. The 
large leaved variety is less fragrant, and the variegated-leaved 
variety has a peculiar color. Tansy is propagated by dividing the 
roots, as the variegated character of the foliage is not produced 
from seeds.

French TAPIOCA, OR MANIOCA. Ccrmau 

■J^apioca, or Manioca. Tapioca. 

No. 1519. — Tapioca is a coarsely granular substance obtained by 
heating, and thus partly changing the moistened starch obtained 
from the roots of the Janipha manihot, a plant which is a native of 
Brazil. There are two chief varieties, and about thirty sub-varieties. 
The root of the sweet cassavas may be eaten with impunity; that of 
the bitter, which is the most extensively cultivated, abounds in an 
acrid, milky juice, which renders it highlj^ poisonous if eaten in the 
recent state. The root is prepared for use by washing, scraping 
and grating or grinding it into a pulp, which, in the bitter variety, 
is submitted to pressure so as to separate the deleterious juice. 
It is now in the state of meal or powder, which is made into bread, 
cakes or puddings. As the poisonous principle is volatile, the por- 
tion which may have remained in the meal is entirely dissipated by 
the heat employed in cooking. Being nutritious, and at the same 
time easy of digestion, and destitute of irritating properties. Tapi- 
oca forms an excellent diet for the sick and convalescent. It is pre- 
pared for use by boiling it in water, and is used, like sago, in sou^is 
and puddings. A factitious Tapioca, known as Pearl Tapioca, is 
made from potato starch, and is sometimes sold as the genuine 
article. 

Note.— Tbe Tapioca obtained from grocers in the United States, is in the form of hard, white, 
irregiilar, rough grains. That which is sold under the name of Manioca, is smaller and iiner, being 
preferred to the large Tapioca. 

TAPIOCA SOUP, WITH BROTH OR CONSOMME.

French TARRAGON. Cerman 

Usiragon. Dragun. 

No. 1521.- — Tarragon is a liardy perennial plant, originally from 
Siberia. It is cultivated for its young shoots and leaves, the latter 
being long-pointed, smooth and aromatic. Both are used as ingre- 
dients in salads, pickles, soups, etc. 

CULTURE. 

No. 1522. — Tarragon is propagated annually by dividing the 
roots. Select a warm, dry situation in April, and set the shoots in 
rows, fifteen inches apart, and cover them with three inches of soil. 
It is sometimes improved by cutting, when they are set three inches

plants will be more healthy, and of finer quality, and will yield 
more abundantly. 

TARRAGON VINEGAR, PLAIN. 

No. 1523. — This is made by an infusion of the leaves in wine 
vinegar, and is greatly esteemed with salads.

TEA. 

The. Thee. 

No. 1525. — The Tea plant is a Dative of China and Japan, being 
cultivated extensively in both countries. In Japan it forms hedge- 
rows around the rice and cornfields; in China, whence immense 
quantities of Tea are exported, whole fields are devoted to its 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE. 353 

culture. It is propagated from seeds, and in three years the plant 
yields leaves for collection, and in six years attains a height of five 
or six feet. After the leaves are gathered they are dried by artifi- 
cial heat, and while hot are rolled in the palms of the hands, so as 
to be brought into the form in which they are found in commerce. 
The odor of the Tea leaves themselves is very slight, and it is 
customary to mix with them the flowers of certain aromatic plants, 
as those of the orange, jasmine, rose, etc., in order to render 
them pleasant to the smell. The flowers are afterwards separated 
by sifting. There "are two principal varieties ^ — the green and the 
black — which differ considerably in flavor and strength. By chem- 
ical tests it has been ascertained that green Tea is colored by sul- 
phate of calcium and Prussian blue. Tea is astringent and gently 
excitant, and in its finer varieties exerts a decided influence over 
the nervous system, producing exhilaration and wakefulness. When 
taken moderately it is perfectly harmless, but in large quantities it 
produces nervousness, dyspepsia, and excites the brain and stom- 
ach. Green Tea is more injurious than black Tea, and should not 
be used by those who are dyspeptic. 

TO MAKE TEA. 

No. 1626. — Tea is made in several different ways. 

The Chinese, who are supposed to know something about it, put 
a few Tea leaves in a cup, then pour boiling water over the leaves, 
and let them steep for a few minutes, having placed a saucer over 
the cup to keep the essence from evaporating. The liquid is then 
strained into another cup, previously warmed with hot water, and 
is ready for use. They use neither milk nor sugar, claiming that 
they injure the delicate aroma of the Tea, which is true. 

The general method of making Tea in America is as follows: 
Use an earthen tea-pot in preference to one of metal. Scald th& 
pot well; then put in the quantity of Tea desired, set the pot on 
the stove, pour over the Tea sufficient boiling water to cover it, and 
let it stand ten minutes to draw. Keep the cover on the pot, and 
do not let the Tea boil. Then pour in as much boiling water as 
is desired, and the Tea is ready for use. Do not pour water over 
Tea unless it is boiling hot, as unboiled water will not extract the 
flavor from the Tea leaves, and will spoil the Tea. Never let Tea. 
boil after it is made. Use the tea-pot only for making Tea. Use 
cold cream in Tea. 

TEA, EUSSIAN STYLE. 

No. 1527. — An agreeable beverage is made as follows: Peel some 
fresh, juicy lemons, and slice them in thin pieces. Put one piece 
23 



354 HAEDER'S AMERICAN COOKERY. 

in the bottom of each cup, sprinkle it with white sugar, and then 
pour in the hot Tea. Sometimes the lemon peel is not removed, 
which imparts a slightly bitter taste to the Tea. * 

ICED TEA. 

No. 1528. — A delicious cold beverage for summer is made by 
making some mixed Tea (black and green), putting it in bottles, and 
setting them on the ice to cool. When ready to serve, pour the 
Tea in goblets, that contain some cracked ice, and sweeten it with 
sugar. A little champagne or rum may be added to each glass, if 
desired, but never add milk. 

AFTER-DINNER TEA. 

No. 1529. — Tea may be served after dinner the same as coffee. 
Serve with some double cream or brandy or rum, whichever may 
be desired. Sandwiches or small cakes usually accompany it. 

TEA FOR INVALIDS. 

No. 1530. — Put the yolk of one raw egg and a teaspoonful of sugar 
in a bowl and mix them well together. Dilute it with four soup- 
spoonfuls of cold milk, then add a cup of hot Tea slowly while stir- 
ring it briskly. Serve immediately. 

TEA CUSTARD, IN CUPS. 

No. 1531. — Make a cupful of the best strong Tea and set it aside 
iio cool. Then put the yolks of twelve raw eggs in a saucepan and 
add half a pound of powdered sugar. Mix them well together with 
a wooden spoon and then dilute it with the cold Tea. Add in slowly 
-one quart of cooled boiled milk, stirring it gently. Then strain the 
mixture through a fine sieve and put it in custard cups. Set the 
cups in a flat saucepan containing hot water, which must reach up to 
the middle of the cups. Put the pan in a moderate oven, and as 
soon as the custard becomes firm take it out. Cover it if desired, 
while cooking. Do not let the water boil, or the custard will be full 
of little holes, instead of being solid throughout. 

Note.— Coffee custard may be made in the same way by using a cupful of strong, black coffee, 
instead of Tea.

Freiich THYME. German 

Thym. Thymian. 

No. 1532. — There are two species of Thyme cultivated for culin- 
■ary purposes : the Common Garden, and the Lemon or Evergreen 
Thyme, botli of which are hardy perennial plants, having a shrubby 
character and a comparatively long growth. The leaves have an 
agreeable, aromatic taste, and are used for flavoring soups, stuffings 
and sauces. They should be used with moderation, as too much 
imparts a bitter taste to the substance. 

CULTUEE. 

No. 1533. — They are propagated from seeds, or by dividing the 
roots; but the finest plants are produced from seeds. Sow them in 
April, in shallow drills twelve inches apart. They should be thinned 
out to eight inches apart, and all weeds should be carefully removed. 
They maybe cut for use as soon as they have made sufficient growth; 
but for drying, the stalks are gathered as they come into flower. 

BROAD-LEAVED THYME. 

No. 1534. — This is the favorite variety. The stem is shrubby, of a 
brownish color, and much branched. The leaves are small, green 
above and whitish beneath.

No. 1535. — The leaves are long, narrow and sharply pointed. 

LEMON THYME. 

No. 1536. — This is a low green shrub, with a somewhat trailing 
stem. It is distinguished from the other varieties by the soft, 
pleasant, lemon-like odor of the young shoots and leaves.

TOMATO. 

Tomate. Liebesapfel. 

No. 1537. — The Tomato is a half-hardy annual plant, originally 
from South America. It is very extensively used in the United 



356 harder' S AMERICAN COOKERY. 

States, being served on the table the entire year in different forms^ 
and is one of the most healthful and best of all garden vegetables. 
The plant, when full grown, is about eight feet high, with a branch- 
ing irregular recumbent stem and dense foliage. The fruit is red, 
white or yellow, and is exceedingly variable in size as well as form. 
The varieties are numerous, few of them appearing to be distinct or 
permanent. Much depends on the cultivation and the temperature 
of the soil. 

CULTURE. 

No. 1538. — The Tomato is raised from seed and succeeds best in. 
light warm and not over rich soil. Success depends on securing a. 
rapid, vigorous, unchecked growth during the early part of the sea- 
son. Sow it in hot beds during March, or from six to eight weeks 
before they can be set out of doors. When the plants have four 
leaves transplant them into shallow boxes, setting them five inches 
apart. Give them plenty of air and endeavor to secure a vigorous 
but steady and healthful growth, so that, at the time of setting them 
in the open ground, they will be strong and stocky and about as. 
broad as they are high, A slight check, while the plants are young, 
will materially diminish their productiveness. Set them out of 
doors as soon as danger from severe frost is over, but before doing- 
so harden off the plants by gradually exposing them to the night 
air and by the withdrawal of water until the wood becomes hard 
and the leaves thick and of a dark green color. Transplant them 
carefully and cultivate well as long as the vines will permit. The 
fruit is improved in quality if the vines are tied to a trellis or to 
stakes. Sufficient plants for the garden of a small family may be 
started with little trouble by sowing a few seeds about the middle 
of March in a garden box or large flower pot and placing it in a 
sunny window of the kitchen. Transplant them in the open ground 
as soon as the weather will permit and the plant is strong enough. 

To have an extra large and beautiful Tomato, as soon as a cluster 
of flowers is visible top the stems down to the cluster, so that the 
flowers terminate the stem. The efl^ect is that the sap is immedi- 
ately impelled into the two buds next below the cluster, which soon 
push strongly and produce another cluster of flowers each. When 
these are visible the branch on which they belong is also topped 
down to their level, and this is done five times successively. By 
this means the plants become stout dwarf bushes about eighteen 
inches high. In order to prevent their falling over, sticks or strings 
are stretched horizontally along the rows so as to keep the plants, 
erect. In addition to this all laterals whatsoever are nipped off. 
In this way the ripe sap is directed into the fruit, which acquires a 
beauty, size and excellence that is unattainable by other means.

TOMATOES, YUM-YUM. 

No. 1593. — Wasli and clean six dozen green Tomatoes, slice them 
finely and add to them about the same quantity of finely sliced 
green peppers. Put them in an earthen jar with one pound of salt, 
mix the whole well together, and on the following day drain off the 
moisture and add one ounce of ground allspice, half an ounce of 
cloves, four ounces of grated horse-radish and six ounces of mustard 
seed. Mix the whole well together and pour over them some boiled 
wine vinegar to cover. Cover the jar tightly and keep it in a cool 
place. 

PKESEEVED TOMATOES. 

No. 1594. — Use only ripe Tomatoes, wash them in cold water and 
trim ofi" the stems. Pour boiling water over them, peel them, cut 
them in quarters and lay them in a wooden tub until all are finished. 
Then put them in a quart or gallon can, solder on the cover and 
boil it in a hot water bath. The quarts require forty-five minutes 
and the gallons an hour and a half to boil. 

PEESERVED TOMATO SAUCE. 

No. 1595. — Select nice red ripe Tomatoes, trim them, wash them 
in cold water, cut them in quarters and put them in a saucepan on 
a brisk fire. Let them boil for fifteen minutes. Spread a cloth over 
a basket or strainer and put the Tomatoes on this cloth to drain for 
one hour. Then rub them through a fine sieve and put the sauce 
in champagne bottles. Cork them tightly, tie the corks down and 
boil the bottles in a hot water bath for thirty minutes. All pre- 
serves should be put on to boil with cold water. When bottles are 
used they should be packed in straw, and when boiled let them 
stand until the water, in which they have been boiled, is cool before 
removing them. When ready for use this sauce may be prepared 
the same as fresh Tomatoes, and for this purpose it is only neces- 
sary to thicken the sauce, season it to taste and strain it again. 

WHOLE TOMATOES, PEESERVED IN SAUCE. 

No, 1596. — Select small, red, ripe, firm Tomatoes, dip them in boil- 
ing water and peel them. Put them into large-mouthed bottles, 
without injuring the Tomatoes, and do not have the bottles too full. 
Fill the bottles with sauce made as in No. 1595 to cover. Cork the 
bottles tightly and tie the corks down. Then boil them in a hot 
water bath for three-quarters of an hour. Before using these Toma- 
toes they should always be warmed in their own sauce.

TOMATO FIGS PRESERVED. 



No. 1597. — The Fig or Bed Pear Tomato, as described in No. 
1553, is one of the very best varieties for preserving. Dip them in 
boiling water and peel them, being careful not to injure them. 
Put five pounds of the Tomatoes in an earthen jar with five pounds 
of crushed cube sugar, then cover them and set them in a cool dry 
place for two or three days. Then drain the juice into a copper 
basin, set it on the fire to boil, skim it well and, when clear of all 
the scum, let the syrup cool and then pour it over the Tomatoes. 
Repeat this operation three times in one week. After this, when 
the weather is favorable, take the Tomatoes out of the jar and place 
them on dishes or plates in the sun to dry for about six or seven 
days, occasionally turning them over, and when they are dried put 
them in boxes lined with white paper. Sprinkle some powdered 
sugar over them, then put another layer of Tomatoes (not too close 
together), then powdered sugar again, then Tomatoes, and continue 
this until the box is full. Cover them and keep them in a dry 
place.

French TONKA BEAN, German 

Tonka (Feve). TonJcabohne.. 

No. 1598. — The Tonka Bean is the seed of a large tree that grows 
in Guiana, Mexico and the Southern part of America. The seed or 
bean is inclosed in an oblong, ovate pod, and is about one inch long 
and one-eighth of an inch wide. It has a dark brown, wrinkled, 
shining, thin and brittle skin, and a light brown oily kernel. It 
has a strong, agreeable aromatic odor and a bitterish taste. It is 
used for culinary purposes as a substitute for vanilla, which it resem- 
bles in flavor. Tobacconists use it largely to flavor tobacco and to 
mix with snuff when ground or powdered.

No. 1599. — Trufiles are a species of fungi that are subterranean 
in their habit and are mostly found in the neighborhood of oak and

chestnut trees, but do not thrive well in thick woods. They are 
found from two inches to one foot below the soil. They have 
neither roots nor stems, and vary in color from white to light brown 
and black. They are somewhat globular in form and vary in size. 
Their surface is knotty or warty, and is covered with a skin or net- 
work which resembles veins. When they have attained their full 
growth they diffuse an agreeable odor which is quite peculiar. The 
flesh is solid and has a delicious taste, but when the Truffles are 
exposed for a few days they begin to decay and become bitter and 
disagreeable. They are put up in cans and bottles and can be ob- 
tained from all first-class grocers. But when canned they have lit- 
tle of the fine flavor and good qualities of the Truffle in its fresh 
state. They are used principally for stuffing turkeys, capons, 
and with goose-liver pates, etc. They have always been held 
in high esteem by epicures, and, owing to their rarity, have 
always commanded a high price. French Truffles can occa- 
sionally be obtained in New York from the stewards on Atlantic 
steamers, but the majority of those used in the United States are 
preserved, and the best brands can only be obtained from respon- 
sible importers. The district of Perigord in France furnishes the 
best flavored Truffles, which are of a black color. In the other 
parts of France they are grayish in color. The Italian Truffles from 
Piedmont are of a whitish color and have an excellent flavor. Truf- 
fles have not yet been found in the United States, although tubers 
that resemble them have been discovered in California, but it has 
not been accurately determined whether they are genuine Truffles 
or not. The following recipes are for canned Truffles.

the fire, and when this is reduced to one-quarter of its original 
quantity, add the Truffles and season with salt and pepper. When 
the Truffles are thoroughly warmed take out the faggot and dish 
them up. Pour the gravy over them and serve them with a dish of

TURNIP. 

J^avet. Ruhe. 

No. 1616. — -The Turnip is a hardy biennial plant, and has been 
cultivated from time immemorial. The roots of all the varieties 
attain their full size during the first year. It is most easily aifected 
in its form and flavor by soil, climate, and mode of culture. There 
are a great many varieties. It is a wholesome and agreeable 
vegetable. 

CULTURE. 

No. 1617. — Sow in drills fourteen inches apart, and half an inch 
■deep. Keep them perfectly free from weeds and, when the bottoms 
begin to enlarge brush away the earth from about the roots to the 
depth of half an inch or more, and give them a light dressing of 
wood ashes. It is the surest mode of obtaining fair and smooth 
turnips in old gardens, where they are almost certain to grow wormy 
if the' earth is allowed to remain in contact with the roots. For the 
spring and summer crops it is important to get them started very 
early, so that they may have time to grow to a sufficient size before 
hot weather, when they will soon become tough and strong. 

For the fall crop sow in the Middle and Western States in the lat- 
ter part of July and August, as directed for the spring sowing.

French TURNIP-CABBAGE, OR KOHLRABI. German 

Chou rave. Kohlrube, 

No, 1652. — The Turnip-Cabbage, or Kohl-rabi, is a vegetable that 
is intermediate between the cabbage and the turnip, combining the 
flavor of both. The erlible part is a turnip-shaped bulb that is 
formed by the swelling of the stem. For table use it should be cut 
when small, as it is then tender and delicate. When it attains its 
full size it becomes tough and stringy. 

CULTURE. 

No. 1653. — It is cultivated best by sowing the seeds in rows, 
from May to July. It is difficult to transplant, hence it is best to 
sow the entire crop from seed, and thin it out as it stands. 

EARLY WHITE VIENNA. 

No. 1654. — An early, small and handsome variety, with a w^hite 
bulb. 

EARLY PURPLE VIENNA. 

No. 1655. — This is similar to the White Vienna, except in color. 

STUFFED TURNIP CABBAGE. 

No. 1656. — Peel and wash one dozen Turnip-Cabbages of equal 
size, parboil them until they are nearly cooked, and then immerse 
them in cold water and drain them. Cut the top parts off, and 
scoop out half of the centre of each, which you will chop finely. 
Add to it some raw forced meat of veal with fine herbs, season with 
salt, pepper, nutmeg and some finely-chopped chives, and mix 
them well together. Then stuflT the scooped Cabbages with this 
preparation and arrange them in a buttered flat saucepan. Moisten 
them with a little veal gravy, then let them boil up once, after 
which set them on the side of the fire to cook slowly until tender, 
basting them occasionally with the gravy. When done dish them

them for five minutes and then drain them. Slice two onions finely 
and put them in a saucepan with a piece of butter. Fry them 
lightly and then add the Cabbages. Season with salt, pepper, and 
nutmeg, and moisten them with a good broth. Cover the saucepan 
and let them cook until tender, when the broth will be nearly re- 
duced. Then add three spoonfuls of Butter or Allemande sauce, 
and a little veal gravy, allowing it to simmer for fifteen minutes. 
Before serving add a little finely -chopped parsley. 

TUENIP-CABBAGE, SMOTHEEED AND GLAZED. 

No. 1660. — Peel one dozen Turnip-Cabbages of even size, parboil 
them until they are half cooked, then immerse them in cold water 
and drain them on a napkin. Then cut out the center of each with 
a round cutter, without breaking them. Arrange them in a deep 
flat saucepan lined with thin slices of fat pork. Then chop one 
handful of fresh mushrooms finely and put them in another sauce- 
pan with one chopped shallot and a piece of butter. Cover the 
saucepan and let them cook until the moisture is reduced. While 
doing this chop the portion of the Cabbage that you scooped out 
finely, and add it to the mushrooms when the moisture is reduced. 
Season them with salt, pepper and nutmeg, add four spoonfuls of 
reduced Allemande sauce and mis the whole together while adding 
the yolks of four raw eggs. Now put this preparation in an earthen 
bowl and when it is cold, add to it four spoonfuls of forced meat of

VANILLA. 

Vanille. Vanille. 

No. 1668. — This is a genus of orchidaceous plants that are natives 
of South America, the West Indies, and Mexico. It is a fleshy, 
dark green perennial, climbing plant, with a long, smooth, dark 
green stem, much branched, and finished at the nodes with atrial 
roots, 'which cling to and obtain nourishment from the tree support- 
ing the plant. The dark green tough leaves are oval, sessile, fleshy 
and veinless. The pale, greenish-yellow flowers are about two inches 
in diameter. The fruit is a slender pod about eight inches long, 
filled with an oily mass containing numerous small, black, shining 
seeds. The pods are collected before they are quite ripe, dried in 
the shade, covered with a coating of fixed oil, and then tied in

bundles which are surrounded with sheet lead, or enclosed in small 
metallic boxes, and sent to market. Several varieties of Vanilla 
exist in commerce. The most valuable is the Manza Vanilla. It 
has a peculiar, strong, agreeable odor, and a warm aromatic, sweet- 
ish taste. The interior pulpy portion is the most aromatic. The 
Simarona Vanilla is smaller, of a lighter color, and less aromatic. 
The pods are dry, and contain no Vanilla. The Pompona or Babo 
Vanilla has pods that are from five to seven inches long, of a dark 
brown color, and possessing a strong odor something like anise. 
Vanilla is used in medicine, in perfumery, and for flavoring in 
cookery. 

VANILLA FLAVOR, 

No. 1669. — Cut four Vanilla beans in pieces one inch long; then

French VEGETABLES. German 

Legume (variee). Gemuse. 

No. 1671. — All kinds and varieties of plants that are cultivated 
for culinary purposes are classed as vegetables. Of some kinds 
merely the seeds or roots are eaten; of others, the leaves or the 
fruit alone is partaken of, while others are used only for seasoning. 

They are classified as follows : 

Alliaceous plants, such as garlic, leeks, onions and shallots. 

Asparaginous plants, such as asparagus, hops, cardoons and arti- 
chokes. 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE. 385 

Brassicaceous plants, sucli as cabbage, cauliflower, kale and 
Brussels sprouts. 

Cucurbitaceous plants, such as melons, cucumbers and squash. 

Esculent roots, such as carrots, potatoes, turnips, oyster plant 
and parsnips. 

Esculent fungi, such as mushrooms and truffles. 

Leguminous plants, such as beans, lentils and peas.

VEGETABLE BALLS, TUTKISH STYLE. 

No. 1672. — Select a good head of cabbage, trim off the white, 
tender leaves, and parboil them for five minutes. Then immerse 
them in cold water, dry them on a napkin, and remove the hard 
ribs. Chop one pound of mutton fillet finely. Put it in a bowl, 
and add one finely-sliced onion, one handful of lightly-parboiled 
rice, a little finely-chopped parsley, three spoonfuls of reduced 
AUemande sauce, and season it highly. Mix the stuffing well 
together, and roll it into balls about the size of a walnut. 
Cover them carefully with the parts of the cabbage leaves, 
arrange them in a flat saucepan close together, in from four 
to six layers, seasoning each layer, and then moisten with 
broth to cover. Put a cover on them to keep them down 
in the pan. Then let them boil until the broth is half re- 
duced. After this set them on the side of the fire to cook slowly. 
When they are cooked the broth should be almost entirely reduced. 
Put the balls on the dish thej^ are to be served on, and make a 
sauce of the strained broth, diluted with the yolks of six raw eggs. 
Add the juice of one lemon to it, pour it over the balls and then 
serve them hot. 

TIMBAL OP VEGETABLE BALLS, MILANAISE STYLE. 

No. 1673. — Prepare the cabbage leaves as in No. 1672. Chop 
one pound of mutton fillet finely, and put it in a bowl. Add half 
a pound of grated fresh fat pork, one handful of fresh bread crumbs, 
one finely-chopped onion, two spoonfuls of .finely-chopped fresh 
mushrooms, and a little finely-chopped parsley. Then season with 
salt and pepper, add two raw eggs, and mix the whole together. 
Roll this stuffing into small balls about the size of a walnut. Cover 
them carefully with the parts of the cabbage leaves, arrange them 
25" 



386 haedee's ameeican cookeey. 

in a flat saucepan close together, in from four to six layers, season- 
ing eacli layer, and then moisten them with broth to cover. Put a- 
cover on them to keep them down in the pan. Then put them on 
the fire and let them cook until the broth is reduced, and they will 
be thoroughly cooked. 

Prepare separately a Eice Rissoti, as in No. 1299, keeping it 
firmer, and add to it six ounces of butter and grated Parmesan 
cheese. 

Butter a Timbal mould, line it with the cabbage leaves, and put 
a layer of the rice around the sides and bottom about one-quarter 
of an inch thick. Now put in a layer of the balls and sprinkle them 
with some grated Parmesan cheese, and a little reduced Tomato- 
sauce. Continue doing this until the mould is full. Cover it with 
a layer of rice, with cabbage leaves over it, and place some thia 
slices of fat pork on top of the leaves. Set the mould in a moderate, 
oven to bake for half an hour. Take out the mould, remove the 
pork, and turn the mould over on a saucepan cover to let the moist- 
ure drain off. Then put the mould on the dish it is to be served 
on, remove the mould and pour over the Timbal a reduced Madeira 
wine sauce, flavored with essence of mushrooms. 

VEGETABLE BORDERS. 

No. 1674. — To make vegetable borders the larger vegetables must 
first be cut with a spoon or column cutter, in any desired shape. 
Those generally used are Carrots, Turnips, Artichoke bottoms, 
Green Peas, String Beans, Brussels Sprouts, Flageolet Beans, and. 
the flower buds of Cauliflower. The Carrots, Turnips and Arti- 
chokes are first parboiled, then cooked in broth seasoned with salt 
and a pinch of sugar. The other vegetables are boiled in plain 
water lightly salted, then immersed in cold water, so they will re- 
tain their color. Then drain and dry them on a napkin. Care must 
be taken when cooking vegetables for borders not to have them 
underdone. 

Butter the mould lightly with clarified butter, and set it in a pan 
in which you have some broken ice. Dip the vegetables desired for 
the border in clarified butter, and place them against the mould in 
whatever design you like, alternating them in color. When the 
butter gets cold the vegetables will adhere to the side of the mould. 
When the border is finished cover it with a layer of forced meat of 
chicken, being careful not to disarrange the design, and to have the 
layers of equal thickness. Then fill the mould with a vegetable 
garniture, to which add a reduced Allemande or Cream sauce. 
Cover it with a forced meat of chicken, and smooth it nicely. On 
this put a buttered paper cover, and poach it for twenty minutes. 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE 387 

When it is ready to serve place a napkin on a saucepan cover, and 
turn the mould on to this napkin. Let it set for a little while to 
drain off the moisture. Then turn the mould on to the dish the 
border is intended to be served on, and carefully remove the mould. 

Note. — This border may be filled with potatoes, or any kind of vegetable puree. Other Borders 
can be prepared with a puree of ■vegetables, such as celery, green peas, spinach, and chestnuts, re- 
ducing the purees well. When they get a little cooled add the yolks of raw eggs, mix them well to- 
gether, and then fill the moulds with the puree. Then poach them and proceed as explained above. 

CHAETREUSE. 

No. 1675. — Chartreuse is one of the finest and most elaborate of 
all vegetable entrees. Young vegetables should be obtained, if 
possible; aud they must be prepared with care, and in a tasteful 
manner. Those that are used to ornament the mould should con- 
sist only of such as will not lose their color in cooking, as their 
fresh and bright appearance is what gives the fine effect to the 
entree. 

Wash and scrape some nice young red carrots, and cut them in 
pieces two inches long. With a column cutter cut out as many red 
pieces as possible, having them one-quarter of an inch in diameter. 
Put them in a basin of cold water as you cut them. 

Now prepare an equal quantity of turnips in the same manner. 
When they are both ready, parboil them separately in lightly-salted 
water; then immerse them in cold water, and drain them. Put them 
in separate saucepans, cover each with sufficient white broth to 
cook them; add a pinch of sugar, and let them cook slowly until 
tender, when the broth will be reduced. Put napkins on two plates; 
place the carrots on one plate and the turnips on the other; cover 
each with a napkin, and set them aside to get cold. (Some of the 
carrots may be cut in squares or in diamond shape if desired.) 

While these are cooking, make a vegetable essence of the carrot 
trimmings, a few turnips, a head of celery cut in small pieces, a few 
parsley roots, and two onions, in each of which stick four cloves. 
Put them in a saucepan with three pints of white broth, and as 
soon as it commences to boil, skim it well, and then let it boil 
slowly until the vegetables are thoroughly cooked. Strain the 
broth through a napkin, and reduce it with four spoonfuls of Espag- 
nole sauce to its proper consistency. 

While these are cooking, prepare the following: Cut one head 
of cabbage in quarters; remove the stalk and hard ribs, and par- 
boil the cabbage for four minutes. Then drain it, and tie each 
piece together. Put the pieces in a saucepan lined with thin slices 
of fat pork, and in the centre put a piece of trimmed and parboiled 
bacon and two sausages, on top of which lay one dressed partridge 
or four larded quails. Season with salt, pepper and a little nut- 



388 haedee's ameeican cookeey. 

meg, and add a faggot of parsley garnished. Cover it with thin 
slices of fat pork, and moisten it with sufficient broth to cover it. 
Now put on the cover, let it cook slowly until thoroughly cooked, 
and then drain it in a colander. 

While the above is cooking, butter a large Timbal mould, and 
decorate the sides and bottom with the pieces of turnips and car- 
rots, placing them side by side, alternating the colors, and arrang- 
ing them in some nice design. Put the mould in a cool place to 
allow the butter to harden and keep the vegetables in their proper 
positions. When the mould is prepared, put the drained cabbage 
in a napkin, and press out all of the moisture; cut the bacon and 
sausage in slices, and carve the partridge or quails. Put a layer of 
the cabbage on the bottom and around the sides. Now put a layer 
of bacon on top of the cabbage, then a layer of sausage, and then 
a layer of partridge or quail, and continue doing this until the 
mould is full, having a layer of cabbage on the top. Put a buttered 
paper cover over it. Now place the mould in a saucepan in which 
there is sufficient water to come half way up to the top of the 
mould. (Be careful not to get any water in the mould.) Set it in 
. a moderate oven to cook for three-quarters of an hour. 

Ten minutes before serving, put a napkin on a saucepan-cover 

. and place the mould on it with the' top down so that the moisture 

will drain off. When ready to serve place the mould on a dish and 

vcarefully remove the mould that surrounds the vegetables. Then 

pour over it the sauce with the essence of vegetables. 

Note.— This Chartreuse can be prepared in various ways as will be explained under the proper 
headings. Squabs, breast of veal, wild ducks, larks, teal ducks, tenderloins of veal and fish can be 
used instead of partridges or quails. It is customary by many to put the birds in the moulds whole, 
but it is best to cut them up beforehand as they can then be served properly. The cabbage can be 
replaced by braised lettuce and the birds can be roasted, then cut in pieces and arranged accordingly. 
Chartreuse is sometimes ornamented with green peas, asparagus tops and string beans by inexper- 
ienced cooks. But this should not be done, as the steam will change the color of these vegetables 
and when they are removed from the mould thay will be unrecognizable and their beautiful effect 
•will be spoilt. , 

TIMBALS OF EGG PLANT, MACKAY STYLE. 

No. 1676. — Peel half a dozen small Egg plants and cut them 
lengthwise in six pieces. Trim each piece so as to have them all 
alike, put them in a bowl and season them with salt. Then cover 
them and one hour later drain off the water and dry them on a 
napkin. Put a piece of butter in a flat saucepan, and when it is 
melted add the Egg plant, fry it lightly and then drain it on a 
n.apkin. When it is cold arrange it in a buttered Timbal mould so 
as to cover the sides and bottom of the mould. Have the following 
preparation ready to put with this : Peel two Egg plants, cut them 
in slices, flour them and fry them lightly in clarified butter on both 
sides; then drain them on a napkin. Cut two braised fillets of 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE. 389 

mutton ia very small pieces, put them in a saucepan and add four 
spoonfuls of cooked fine herbs and two of fresh bread crumbs. 
Season with salt and pepper and add the yolks of two raw eggs. 
Mix the whole well together, then put a layer of this stuffing in the 
mould and then a layer of the fried Egg plant, continuing in this 
way until the mould is filled. Cover it with a buttered paper cover 
and bake it in a moderate oven for half an hour. When ready for 
use turn the mould on to the dish, remove it carefully and glaze the 
Timbal with a reduced Madeira wine sauce. Serve a brown Italian 
sauce separate. 

TIMBAL OF SAUEEKRAUT, GERMAN STYLE. 

No. 1677. — Cook one pound of sauerkraut with half a pound of 
parboiled lean salt pork and, when they are three-quarters done, 
drain them in a colander and allow them to get cold. 

Prepare a Timbal mould and line it with a pate paste. Put a 
layer of sausage meat mixed with fine herbs, in the bottom; then 
put a layer of sauerkraut on that with a few thin slices of the above 
pork and some slices of fresh fillet of pork over it. Continue doing 
this until the mould is full. Over this put a layer of pate paste to 
close the top tightly and place a buttered paper cover over it. Set 
the mould in a moderate oven to bake slowly for one hour and a. 
half. Then remove the paper cover, turn the Timbal over on a dish, 
and remove the mould. Make a hole in the centre of the Timbal 
and put in a few spoonfuls of Madeira wine sauce. 

SMALL VEGETABLE PATES, FRENCH STYLE. 

No. 1678. — Cut one onion in small pieces one quarter of an inch 
square, and put it in a saucepan with a piece of butter. Fry it 
lightly, and then add one carrot and one turnip cut in small square 
pieces, the white part of a stalk of celery, half of a parsnip, and a 
little cabbage cut in fine shreds. Fry this mixture lightly for a few 
minutes, not letting it get browned. Then season it with salt, pep- 
per, and a pinch of sugar, and moisten it with just enough broth to 
cook it. Let it cook until the moisture is reduced to a glaze, and 
then add a soup-spoonful of reduced AUemande or Cream sauce,, 
and some finely-chopped parsley. Then set it aside to get cold. 

Now roll out some puff paste on the table as you would do when 
making pies, and with a three-inch round granulated cutter cut out 
some pieces. Wet the border of each, put some of the above stuff- 
ing in the center, and then place one of the round pieces of puff 
paste on top to cover each one. Press the edges close together, 
and put them on a buttered and floured pan. Now baste them with.

SMALL VEGETABLE PATES, AMERICAN STYLE. 

No. 1679. — Cut equal quantities of onions, carrots, celery and 
cabbage, in small square pieces. Put them in a saucepan with a 
piece of butter, and fry them lightly. Then moisten them with 
enough broth to cook them, and let them cook until the broth is 
reduced to a glaze. Now season with salt, pepper, nutmeg and a 
pinch of sugar, and add some reduced AUemande or Cream sauce, 
and some cooked asparagus tops, or green peas, that have been 
cooked separately (or any kind of vegetable that is in season). 
Mix the whole well together, add a little finely-chopped parsley, and 
then set it aside to get cold. 

Make a pate paste, or use the trimmings of some puff paste. Roll 
out the paste, and with a three-inch oblong granulated cutter cut 
out some pieces. Wet the border of each and put some of the above 
stuffing in the center, and then place one of the oblong pieces of 
paste on top to covereach one. Press the edges close together and 
put them on a buttered and floured pan. Now baste them with the 
yolks of eggs diluted with water, and bake them in a hot oven. 
Serve them hot on a napkin. 

SMALL VEGETABLE CRUSTS, MACEDOINE STYLE. 

No. 1680. — Butter and flour one dozen small Timbal moulds that 
are a little larger at the top than at the bottom. Now roll out a 
pate paste, line the moulds with it, and fill them with flour. Cover 
them with a layer of paste, make a nice border around the top of 
each, and baste them with the yolk of an egg diluted with a few 
drops of water. Now bake them in an oven and, when they are 
cooked, cut out the covers without injuring the borders. Remove 
the flour, and baste the inside and outside of the crusts with the 
yolks of eggs. Then set them in a moderate oven to dry. Garnish 
the crusts with a Macedoine of Vegetables, such as peas, beans, 
asparagus-tops and carrots, each being cooked separately. The 
crusts can be filled with these vegetables, mixed or singly. Add to 
them, before filling, a reduced AUemande or Cream sauce. 

VEGETABLE BREAD. 

No. 1681. — This is made with any kind of vegetable purees. 
When the puree is cooked, it should be made firmer than when 
used as a garniture. The yolks of raw eggs must be added when 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE. 391 

ilie puree is cold. Purees that are thin will require more eggs than 
ihose that are thick; and a reduced Cream sauce may also be added 
to make them of the required consistency. 

Put the puree in small buttered moulds, poach them, and serve 
■with either Cream, Allemande or Espagnole sauce. 

Note.— After they are cooked and become cold, they may be cut into a variety of shapes, and used 
-as a garniture for soups. They may also be cut in slices one-quarter of an inch thick, then breaded, 
-and fried, to be used as a garniture. 

MACEDOmE OF YEGETABLES, SPANISH STYLE. 

No. 1682. — Put two finely sliced white onions in a saucepan with

cucumbers are scalloped and tossed in butter. The string beans are 
cut in diamond shape, about an inch long, and boiled in lightly 
salted water and then immersed in cold water, so they will retain 
their green color. Brussels sprouts and peas must be boiled and 
treated in the same manner. The flower buds only of cauliflowers,

to use it, beat the whites of four eggs into a stiff froth, and add 
them to the batter, mixing the whole gently. 

VEGETABLE SALADS. 

No. 1698. — All vegetables that can be eaten raw or cooked can be 
used in salads. They are seasoned with salt, pepper, oil and vine- 
gar, and are generally eaten cold. Various salad dressings and 
lierbs are sometimes used in their preparation. Salads should vary 
according to the season of the vegetables. Care should be taken 
not to bruise any of the vegetables used in a salad. Green salads 
make a refreshing breakfast dish. Endives and dandelion should 
be dressed with a plain dressing and a piece of bread rubbed with 
garlic should alwa3^s be added. The corn-salad or lamb-lettuce 
makes a delicious salad, dressed with pickled beets. A mustard 
dressing should be added to celery, and a few drops of Worcester- 
shire sauce also, to heighten the flavor if desired. Water-cress 
should be served fresh and plain. It is excellent with roasted or 
broiled fowl. Lettuce and cos lettuce are two popular salads. Do 
not dress it until ready to serve. Fine herbs may be added, and 
also a garniture of hard-boiled eggs. Mixed vegetable salads are 
best in spring, when the vegetables are young and tender. In mix- 
ing them see that they harmonize in taste and color. The best 
vegetables for salads are green and white beans, new or pickled 
beets, potatoes, small onions, carrots, artichoke bottoms, asparagus 
tops, green peas, and gherkins. Occasionally some anchovies, 
pickled herrings, capers, olives, truffles, and yolks of eggs may be 
added. Be very careful in seasoning salads. Always season with 



396 HARDER'S AMERICAN COOKERY. 

the oil first, because if too much vinegar is used it will settle in the 
bottom of the salad bowl, instead of mixing with the oil properly. 
Never try to mix the salt with the vinegar. It is best to sprinkle 
it over the salad with the pepper, or it can be mixed with the oil. 
Green salads are used at breakfast or dinner, while the salads that 
are made of fowl or fish are best at a luncheon, supper, or collation. 
Cucumbers and tomatoes can be served with the fish. 

Recipes for making the various kinds of sauces for salads will be 
found in the " Book on Sauces." 

COMPOUND VEGETABLE SALAD.

to serve the salad, the vegetables are mixed and nicely dressed in a 
salad bowl with a Ravigote or Mayonnaise sauce. For a large salad 
it is best to dress each vegatable in bunches, alternating them, and,

HOW TO PEEPAEE MOULDS WITH ASPIC JELLY, FOR SALADS. 

No. 1709. — The salads following this recipe are different from the 
foregoing, being made in moulds, and dressed on stands or borders, 
or on bread masked with butter for a relief and as a convenience in 
garnishing. They are used principally at balls and banquets, and 
when nicely executed they form a handsome ornament to a table. 
Much depends upon the proficiency of the party making them; and 
special care should be taken to have the Aspic jelly clear, and not 
too firm. In cold weather it need not be as solid as when the 
weather is warm. They may be made in Charlotte or Timbal moulds, 
if desired; but it is best to use the regular Salad moulds that are 
made expressly for this purpose. They contain a false mould, 
which is inserted after the mould is ornamented. The space around 
this false mould is filled with jelly, and allowed to become firm. 
Warm water is then put in the centre of the mould, so it can be 
removed easily, which leaves the center vacant, to be filled with the 
salad. Then smooth off the top evenly, and set the mould aside to 
get cold until ready for use. Then dip the mould in warm water, 
wipe it dry, and then turn it out on the dish it is to be served on. 

The mould is prepared, arranged and decorated as follows : Put 
the mould in a pan containing some cracked ice, and let it get cold. 
Put some cool Aspic jelly in the mould, and turn the mould around 
constantly until it is thinly and evenly coated with the jelly on the 
sides and bottom. (It takes considerable practice to do this per- 
fectly.) Drain your vegetables, and dry them well on a napkin. 
Dip each piece separately in a cool Aspic jelly, and arrange them 
in the bottom and around the sides of the mould in the design that 
you prefer, alternating the colors. When this is done, line it with 
another coating of jelly, set it aside to get cold, and then fill the 
centre with the prepared salad. Truffles, capers, olives and the 
whites of eggs can be used to decorate the mould, instead of vege- 
tables, if desired.

-extensively cultivated in the United States. The fruit is roundish 
or oblong, and in color it is green or of variegated green 
shades. It is much more vigorous than the musk-melon, though 
inferior to the cantaloupe. Its abundant and cooling juice renders 
it very refreshing during summer. It is less liable to injury from 
insects than &nj other variety of melon. 

CULTURE. 

No. 1716. — Water-melons require a rich, though rather sandy 
soil for their best development, and thrive best in warm latitudes, 
26 



402 HARDER's AMERICAN COOKERY. 

growing best in the Southern and Southwestern States. Cultivate- 
exactly the same as for musk-melons, except that the hills should 
be just double the distances apart, namely, eiglit and ten feet. 

GEORGIA RATTLESNAKE. 

' No. 1717. — One of the largest varieties, and stands shipment long 
distances better than any other. It is the sort used at the South 
for northern shipments. It is a beautifully striped variety, of very 
large size, with red flesh of the finest flavor. 

CUBAN QUEEN. 

No. 1718. — One of the largest melons known, often attaining up-^ 
wards of eighty pounds in weight. The vine is vigorous, and the- 
skin striped, light and dark green. The flesh is bright red, solid, 
very crisp and sugary. 

CALIFORNIA OR IMPROVED ODELLA. 

No. 1719. — -One of the best sorts for shipping purposes, as it has 
a tough, thin rind, which enables it to stand an amount of hand- 
ling that would crack open other varieties. The flavor is excellent 
and quite distinct. 

ORANGE. 

No. 1720. — So called from its peculiar rind, which separates from 
the flesh when fully ripe. The flesh is red, tender and sweet. 

CITRON AND CALIFORNIA PIE MELON. 

No. 1721. — These melons are used in making sweetmeats and 
preserves by removing the rind and seeds, cutting the flesh in pieces 
of equal size, then boiling them in syrup which has been flavored 
with ginger, and then proceeding the same as with musk-melons 
in Nos. 922 and 923. They ripen late in season and will keep until 
December. The flesh is white, solid, tough, seedy, very squashy,. 
and unpalatable in its crude state. 

BLACK SPANISH. 

No. 1722. — Their small vines enables them to be grown closer 
than any other sorts. They are round in form, and dark-green in. 
color. The flesh is scarlet, rich and sugary ia flavor.

North. The vine is vigorous, hardy and productive. The fruit is 
medium, oval, and finely mottled with light and dark-green, some- 
what in stripes. The rind is thin, and the flesh bright scarlet, solid 
to the centre, crisp, nutty, and sweet. 

EARLY JERSEY. 

No. 1727. — One of the earliest varieties, above the medium size, 
oval round, and light-green in color. The flesh is scarlet, solid, 
finely grained, very sweet and juicy. 

HOW TO SERVE MELONS. 

No. 1728. — Water-melons are served as a relish, or for dessert, 
and should be kept in a cool place for some time before 
serving. Cut a piece from each end, and then cut the melon in a 
zig-zag shape in the centre, which will divide the melon in half, 
and set each half on a dish with a napkin. Place them on the table, 
and when ready to use, cut them in slices. 

Note. — Cut a plug out of the melon, pour a glass of brandy inside, replace the plug, keep the 
melon in a cool place, and occasionally turn it. In twenty-four hours the brandy will be absorbed, 
and the melon ready to serve. This makes a delicious change from the ordinary way of eating

French WHEAT. German 

-FrOTmnt. Weitzai. 

No. 1729. — Wheat is a plant of the genus Triticum, The seed of 
■this plant furnishes a white flour for bread and, next to rice, is the 
.grain most generally used by the human race. The varieties are 
numerous, comprising the Summer and Winter Wheat, the Bearded 
Wheat, the White Wheat and the Bald Wheat. The Summer and 
Winter Wheat furnishes most of the grain that is used for food. 

WINTER WHEAT. 

MICHIGAN RRONZE OR MEDITERRANEAN HYBRID. 

No. 1730. — This is a cross between the old Diehl and the Red 
Mediterranean, having the fine flavoring qualit}^ and bearded head of 
the latter and the close comj)act head of the former. It is a vigor- 
ous grower and is well adapted to light soil. The heads are some- 
what club-shaped, short, but very compact, and are squarely filled 
out at both ends, containing about sixteen breasts of from three to 
four kernels each. The berry is of a bright amber color, of medium 
;size and very handsome. 

VALLEY. 

No. 1731. — This variety originated in Ohio and yields enormously, 
but needs rich ground and good cultivation. The heads are bearded, 
long and loose, and have a peculiarly rough and ragged appearance. 
They contain from sixteen to twenty breasts, having three or four 
kernels each. The berry is long and hard, and of an amber color. 

martin's amber. 

No. 1732,- — A hybrid variety that originated in the eastern part 
■of Pennsylvania. While young, the plants lie spread out over the 
ground, affording a good protection to their own roots. The straw 
is tall and very stiff, standing up better than most varieties. The 
leaves are dark green and quite free from rust. It has a large, 
bald, smooth, well-filled head, containing from sixteen to eighteen 
breasts, and is rather late in ripening. The berry is of a light 
amber color, good size and very plump and handsome. It has a 
very thin hull and makes but little bran; however it yields a large 
return of flour of the very best quality. 



THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE. 405

No. 1733. — .^ variety that originated in Pennsylvania and is be- 
coming very popular in Canada. It is very early. The heads are 
bearded and compact, with white chaff. The berry is of a very light 
amber color and is superior for milling qualities. 

FULTZ. 

No. 1734. — Although not as showy in the field as the Clawson, 
the Fultz will generally yield quite as much grain — that is of a better 
milling quality. It is much esteemed in Pennsylvania and Ohio, 
and is becoming popular elsewhere. The straw stands up well. 
The leaves are large, of a dark green color and free from rust. It 
has smooth, medium-sized, compact heads, containing from sixteen 
to eighteen breasts of two and three kernels each. The berry is of 
a dull amber color, medium in size and long.

heads are bearded and well filled. It succeeds well in nearly all 
localities, and ripens early. 

WINTER PEARL. 

No. 1737. — The heads are beardless, regular and verj^ handsome, 
about five and a half inches long, with from eighteen to twenty 
breasts of four grains each. The kernels are about the size of the 
Clawson, hard, plump, and of a light amber color. It produces 
abundantly in good wheat fields.

No. 1738.— This is a beardless variety of remarkably robust and 
vigorous growth. The straw is strong, stiff, well glazed and healthy.

406 harder' S AMERICAN COOKERY. 

Care should therefore be taken not to let it get over-ripe before 
harvesting. 

ADAMANT WHEAT. 

No. 1739, — This is one of the hardiest and most flinty varieties 
in cultivation, and is very productive and vigorous. It is a beard- 
less, white-chatf variety, with long narrow heads, closely set with 
medium sized amber-colored kernels, which produce flour of a very 
superior quality. It is one of the most desirable sorts for cultiva- 
tion in the Northwest, Colorado and the Pacific Coast, where hard 
wheat is the favorite sort. 

GREEN MOUNTAIN WHEAT. 

No. 1740. — A beardless variety much cultivated in Vermont. The 
straw is of a light yellow color, very strong, and free from rust. 
The heads average five inches in length, and are somewhat tapering.

drain and parboil it for two minutes, after which drain it again, and 
put it in a saucepan with a quart of veal broth. Let it boil slowly 
for an hour, and season it lightly. 

SOUP — CREAM OF GREEN FARINA WHEAT. 

No. 1742. — Green wheat can be procured in grains or in the same 
way as Farina (Semoule). The latter is preferred, as it cooks much 
quicker. , It is greatly relished by Germans. 

Put four quarts of broth in a saucepan, and when it boils drop in 
slowly one pound and a half of the green- Farina Wheat, stirring it 
gently until it boils. Then set it on the side of the fire to boil 
slowly, and add a faogot of parsley garnished with leeks and green 
onions. Let it cook for one hour, then skim it, take out the faggot, 
and strain the soup through a fine sieve. Then put the soup in a 
saucepan, set it on the fire, and stir it until it boils. Season with 
salt, pepper, and a pinch of sugar. Let it boil sloWly for fifteen 
minutes, then set it on the side of the fire to keep warm. Before 
serving add six ounces of butter, and half a pint of cream, diluted 
with the yolks of eight raw eggs. Mix it well until the butter is

ticial to poultry. 

ROMAN WORMWOOD. 

No. 1748. — Resembles the common Wormwood, but the leaves are

bitter to the taste. When bruised they emit a strong, pleasant 
aromatic flavor.
