INTKODUCTORY. 



This little handbook is offered to house- 
keepers, in order that they may readily under- 
stand the popular dietetic formulas so universal- 
ly recommended by physicians, many of whom 
neglect the details of preparing the nutriment 
they prescribe, owing probably to the fact that 
all physicians are not cooks, as many of them 
were in olden, and all of them should be in 
modem, times. 

An exhaustive work on the subject of dietetics 
would naturally embrace many things, which, 
while excellent in certain diseases, would lead to 
distressing results in others. Care should there- 
fore be exercised not to administer other than 
the most simple diet until the nature of a disease 
is known, and even then the habits of the inva- 
lid should be taken into consideration. 

A nurse must always keep in view the fact 
that the great desideratum is to administer the 
most nutritious food in such form that the pa- 
tient can most easily assimilate it. 




8 INTRODUCTORY. 

One word in regard to patent medicines. 
The sick-room is not the place for experiments, 
and we trust the time is not far distant when 
all so-called remedies and alleged health foods 
and drinks shall not be permitted to be sold or 
offered for sale, until they receive the indorse- 
ment of responsible boards of health. 

The lives that are sacrificed yearly by the ad- 
ministration of soothing (?) syrups and other 
pernicious nostrums are something terrible to 
contemplate, and the most stringent laws should 
be in force regulating their sale ; in no case 
should they be sold without a physician's pre- 
scription. 

Nurses have been known to purchase these 
poisonous compounds, and clandestinely ad- 
minister them to children in their charge, 
thereby dwarfing their intellects, and, in some 
instances, actually destroying the lives of the 
children. 




BROTHS. 

Beef Broth.— -A well-made beef broth con- 
tains more nutriment than the old-fashioned 
beef tea, and is therefore the best of the many 
nourishing formulas known to the sick-room. 

In appearance, also, the broth is far superior 
to the tea, which is a very important factor in 
the diet for the sick. 

The choicest piece of meat for broth is a neck 
piece. Chop bone and meat quite small, and 
see to it that there is about one third bone to 
two thirds meat. Put into a gallon crock or jar 
one pound of the meat, and add a quart of cold 
water ; cover the jar with a plate, and place 
it in a deep saucepan of water. Simmer for 
four hours, strain into a smaller saucepan, and 
boil until reduced nearly one half ; remove 
every particle of fat or scum. Now comes the 
all-important question of seasoning, wherein we 
are necessarily obliged to consult the ^tidious 
tastes of the invalid. Celery-salt or a stalk of 
celery allowed to simmer in the broth is accept- 
able, and the best mode of adding pepper (when 




lO bEEF JUICE. 

it is allowed) is to let a red-pepper pod remain 
in the broth for a moment or two. Ground 
pepper is objectionable for various reasons. 
Dyspeptic patients are very apt to crave season- 
ings that cannot be taken with impunity. To 
serve beef broth, care must be exercised that it 
is not too hot ; half a cupful at a time is all that 
should be served. 

Beef Juice.— Have the dealer cut a thin slice 
of rump steak, remove the fat, and singe the 
outside slightly, then scrape it into shreds with a 
knife. Warm the beef- press by pouring hot 
water over it, dry it, and with it press out the 
juice into glass or cup. Place the cup in warm 
water, and allow the juice to become quite warm, 
and add a little salt A warmed lemon-squeezer 
may be used instead of the press. 

Rump steak is recommended because it con- 
tains more flavor than other cuts. 

Beef Tea for Convalescents.— As the old- 
fashioned beef tea is sometimes recommended, 
we give the following recipe for its preparation : 
Shred half a pound of lean steak, let it stand in 
a pint of cold water for three quarters of an 
hour, then put both into a quart champagne 
bottle. Cut a long slit in the cork before plac- 
ing it in the bottle. Set the bottle in a sauce- 
pan of warm water, simmer one hour and a half, 




LIEBIG's extract of beef. II 



and strain through a napkin into a goblet. Now 
add a teaspoonful of finely shredded raw, lean 
beef, let stand a few moments, add a little salt 
and serve. 

Iiiebig's Extract of Beef.— This and other 
extracts are often recommended by physicians. 

A singular fact in connection with this extract 
is that the extract made in Texas by this firm 
is, in the opinion of some of our leading physi- 
cians, worthless as nutriment, while the extract 
made in South America, by the same company, 
is highly recommended. 

The author, being somewhat surprised that 
there should be a difference, made inquiries and 
learned that to the flesh of every two vacd (fat 
cow) was added a third of the flesh of a segua, 
or mare, in making the extract These animals 
feed on esportillo, which is a thin, reed -like 
grass, said to be very fattening. The extract 
made in the United States is prepared from beef 
only. 

Is there more nutriment in the flesh of the 
horse than in that of the cow ? 

Mutton Broth. —Although mutton possesses 
a lower degree of nutritive value than beef, it is 
nevertheless one of the most important of ani- 
mal foods, being easily digested. 

Like beef, the neck part of mutton is most 



fl^V 



12 VEAL BROTH. 

appropriate for the making of broth. Trim off 
the surplus fat from the piece of meat, and to a 
pound of the lean (with bone added) add a 
quart of cold water ; simmer gently for two hours, 
strain, and let it become cold. When wanted 
remove every particle of fat. Put a small quan- 
tity of it in a saucepan, and allow it to become 
•quite hot ; salt slightly, and allow a red-pepper 
pod to remain in it for a moment. Have ready 
a small quantity of boiled rice, add it to the 
broth, and let stand a few moments before serv- 
ing. A very small piece of onion is sometimes 
added to the meat when first cooked to destroy 
the peculiar mutton flavor which is so objection- 
able to many patients. 

Veal Broth.— Veal, although less nutritive 
than either beef or mutton, and less digestive, is 
sometimes recommended, owing to its having a 
laxative action. The broth is prepared in a 
similar way to mutton broth. 

Chicken Broth.—** The domestic chicken," 
says Barthalow, * * is a most important article of 
food for sick and convalescents. The taste is 
agreeable, the tissues soft and easy of mastica- 
tion and digestion. Spring chickens are more 
tender and delicate than the fully developed 
fowls of four to six months old. Next to the 
chicken in point of digestibility is the domestic 



SCALLOP BROTH. 1 3 

turkey, and after this the domestic goose and 
duck." Cut up half a chicken into neat pieces ; 
add a quart of cold water and a small piece of 
celery ; cover and boil slowly for two hours. 
Then remove all fat carefully, strain, add salt, 
and serve. If rice is used, boil it with the 
chicken, and add it half an hour before the 
chicken is cooked. 

Scallop Broth.— The peculiar flavor of scal- 
lops is quite atrractive to the convalescent, and 
a broth made from them is nourishing ; but care 
should be exercised in selecting the shell -fish. 
To improve their appearance, shippers add 
quantities of salaeratus to the scallops, which has 
the effect of bleaching them and increasing their 
size ; this custom may please the dealers, but not 
consumers. Select medium -sized scallops of a 
natural creamy color, wash them, and cut them 
into small pieces. To a half a pint of these add 
half a pint of warm water and half a pint of 
milk, a ** pea" of butter, and a pinch of salt ; 
simmer for twenty minutes ; strain and serve. 

A pint of milk and no water may be used if 
the patient desires it. 




14 OATMEAL GRUEL. 



GRUELS. 

Oatmeal Gruel. — Oatmeal, in any form, 
should not be given to patients who are suffering 
from diarrhoeal diseases or of irritable mucous 
membrane. While it is rich in nutriment, it is 
not always a good food, because it is irritating. 

Dr. Mott says that while many are under the 
impression that oatmeal is a tiue laxative, it is 
not properly so. Sift two ounces of oatmeal. 
Boil a quart and a pint of water, add to it a salt- 
spoonful of salt ; now add gradually the oat- 
meal, stirring constantly while adding the meal. 
Boil for one hour, remove to the back of the 
range until water enough has evaporated to 
make it of the proper consistency ; part milk 
may be used instead of all water. 

This recipe calls for the '* old process" mill- 
ing, which requires much longer cooking than 
the new preparations now on the market, many 
of which are advertised as being partly cooked, 
requiring but a few moments' more cooking to 
convert them into the most excellent food. 

Housekeepers, when preparing oatmeal for 
delicate stomachs, should ignore the ten, or even 
twenty-minute, propositions, and cook these 
preparations at least one hour. 




CEREALINE GRUEL. 1 5 

Cerealine Gruel.— Proceed as for oatmeal 
gruel, and add half a pint of cerealine to a quart 
of boiling water, slightly salted. Boil for half 
an hour, and serve with a little sugar. All milk 
may be used, if desired. 

Bice Gruel.— Mix together one tablespoonful 
of rice- floor, a saltspoonf ul of salt, and a small 
cup of cold water. Add the contents of the 
cup to a pint of boiling water, and boil for 
twenty minutes. Sugar should be served sep- 
arately, and, when too thick, add milk until of 
the proper consistency. 

Arrow-Boot Gruel.— Take one tablespoon- 
ful of arrow- root, a pinch of salt, and half a gill 
of cold water, stir into half a pint of boiling 
water, and boil for fifteen minutes. 

Barley Gruel.— Take two tablespoonfuls of 
pearl barley washed in warm water. To a 
quart and half a pint of cold water add a heap- 
ing saltspoonful of salt and the washed barley. 
Boil for three quarters of an hour ; strain ; add a 
cake of cut sugar to each gobletful, and twist 
over the glass a piece of lemon-peel, the oil of 
which gives a pleasant flavor. 

Barley Water.— Wash one ounce of pearl 
barley in cold water. Drain off the water, and 
add to a quart and a pint of boiling water the 
barley, a piece of lemon-peel, and sugar enough 



m 



l6 RICE WATER. 

to be just perceptible to the taste ; simmer on 
back of range until reduced one half, and serve 
unstrained. Other harmless flavoring ingredi- 
ents may be used instead of the lemon. 

Rice "Water.— To a quart and a pint of cold 
water add two ounces of well-washed rice ; salt 
slightly, and add two cakes of sugar. Boil in 
the double saucepan until the rice has dissolved. 
Flavor with lemon-peel or stick cinnamon. 

A palatable jelly is made by straining the 
liquid, and flavoring it with lemon, wine, or 
brandy, then poured into moulds and placed on 
ice. 

Alcohol, in any form, should not be allowed 
patients except under medical advice. 




TOAST. 17 



TOAST. 



Toast is very palatable and digestible when 
properly prepared. Many seem to think that 
they have made toast when they brown the out- 
side of a slice of bread. Have they ? 

The object in making toast is to evaporate all 
moisture from the bread, and holding a slice 
over the fire to singe does not accomplish this j 
it only warms the moisture, making the inside 
of the bread doughy and decidedly indigestible* 
The true way of preparing it is to cut the bread 
into slices a quarter of an inch thick, trim off 
all crust, put the slices in a pan or plate, place 
them in the oven — which must not be too hot — 
take them out when a delicate brown, and butter 
at once. 

For my own use I dry all home-made bread 
in this manner. 

Dry Toast should be served within the folds 
of a napkin if you wish to keep it . hot ; toast- 
racks allow the heat to escape, and they are not 
recommended. 

Dip Toast.—Prepare the toast as above 
directed ; dip the edges into hot water quickly, 
and butter at once. This is also called water 
toast. 






1 8 MILK TOAST. 

Milk Toast.— Wet the pan to be used with 
cold water, which prevents burning. Melt an 
ounce of floured butter ; whisk into it a pint of 
hot milk ; add a little salt ; simmer. Prepare 
four slices of toast ; put them in a deep dish 
one at a time ; pour a little of the milk over 
each, and over the last one pour the remainder 
of the milk. 

Anchovy Toast. — The best way to prepare 
this appetizing dish is as follows : Toast the 
bread and trim it neatly, and place it near the 
range to keep warm ; next prepare a ** dip," as 
for ordinary cream toast ; spread a thin layer of 
anchovy paste on each slice of bread ; place in 
a hot, deep dish ; pour the prepared cream over 
them, and serve. 

Clam Toast. — Chop up two dozen small 
clams into fine pieces ; simmer for thirty min- 
utes in hot water enough to cover them. Beat 
up the yolks of two eggs ; add a little cayenne 
and a gill of warmed milk ; dissolve half a tea- 
spoonful of flour in a little cold milk ; simmer 
all together ; pour over buttered toast, and 
serve. 

Marro-w-bone Toast.— Procure two beef 
shin-bones about six to eight inches long ; cover 
them with dough, and wrap them in muslin ; 
pour hot water enough to cover them, and boil 




OYSTER TOAST. 



19 



for an hour and a half. Remove cloth and 
dough ; shake or draw out the marrow with a 
long-handled fork upon slices of hot toast 
Add salt, cayenne, and, if convenient, a little 
chopped celery, and serve. 

Oyster Toast.— Select fifteen plump oys- 
ters ; chop them fine, and add salt, pepper, and 
a suspicion of nutmeg. Beat up the yolks of 
two eggs with a gill of cream ; whisk this into 
the simmering oysters. When set, pour the 
whole over slices of buttered toast 

Salmon Toast.— It very often occurs that a 
can of salmon is not all used at a meal, and yet 
there is not quite enough for another meal with- 
out other dishes or ingredients added to it. 
Should this occur, mince the salmon, heat, and 
season it and serve it on toast A poached 
egg added to it is quite acceptable. 

Tongue Toast.— A very nice dish is pre- 
pared from cold boiled or potted tongue. Slice 
the tongue, and cut each slice into small, fine 
pieces ; heat it in a pan with a little butter. To 
prevent burning, moisten with warm water or 
clear soup ; add salt and pepper ; stir into it 
two beaten eggs. When set, arrange neatly on 
toast 

Dainty bits of roast game, fowl, etc. , minced, 
warmed over, and served on toast are excellent

20 FRAPPE CHAMPAGNE. 



DIET DRINKS. 

Frapp6 Champagne renders important ser- 
vice in irritable states of the stomach, especiall}' 
in sea-sickness, vomiting of pregnancy, yellow- 
fever, cholera morbus, and cholera. To pro- 
duce y9-a//e champagne quickly, proceed as fol- 
lows : Put into a metal wine-cooler, or any 
other metal receptacle, a bottle of dry cham- 
pagne, surround it with alternate layers of rock 
salt and cracked ice, place the cooler on the hot 
range, and the rapid melting of the ice will so- 
lidify the wine in five minutes ; if allowed to re- 
main a longer period the wine will become solid, 
and refuse to leave its glassy prison. 

When we take into consideration the fact that 
by the old method of revolving the wine in its 
icy walls, a period of thirty minutes is required 
to frappe it, the above phenomenal method 
of producing the desired result will be appre- 
ciated. 

Sparkling wines, as a rule, are more seda- 
tive to the stomach, and more intoxicating 
relatively to their alcoholic strength than still 
wines. 

Sweet champagnes contain a vast quantity of 
unappropriated sugar. When such wines are 




J 



WINE WHEY. 21 

used they produce acid fermentation, and acidity 
with headache quite naturally follows. 

Agents of sweet champagnes wear out their 
vocal chords telling their patrons to serve wines 
as cold as possible ; in this way the sugar is not 
easily detected, and a large sale of particular 
brands is the result. But let me warn my read- 
ers who use champagne that a fine dry cham- 
pagne is almost ruined by the low temperature 
at which it is usually served at restaurants, re- 
ceptions, etc. A very cold champagne is a dan- 
gerous tipple for even a healthy stomach, espe- 
cially near bedtime. 

Wine Whey.— Boil a pint of sweet milk and 
add half a gill of sherry. Let it simmer for 
fifteen minutes, skim off the curd, add a gill of 
sherry, and remove curd as it rises. Straining 
may be necessary to remove the curd entirely. 
Sweeten. 

Bggnog.— Scald half a pint of milk ; when 
cold add one egg well beaten, two teaspoonfuls 
of sugar, and a tablespoonful of choice brandy. 
Shake or beat the mixture with a fork. This 
formula is only intended for invalids, and is not 
the recipe used in cq/ys. 

Sherry and Egg.— Beat up one egg thor- 
oughly, add a teaspoonful of sugar, and a wine 
glass full of dry sherry. 




22 CURRANT-JELLY WATER. 



FRUIT DRINKS. 

Currant-Jelly Water. -Dissolve a teaspoon- 
ful of currant- jelly in a goblet of cold water, 
and add one cake of cut sugar. 

Currant Water.— Simmer gently for ten 
minutes a pint of fresh-picked currants in a 
quart of water, add a heaping tablespoonful of 
powdered sugar, and, when cold, strain. There 
is a litde economy in adding the sugar after the 
juice is strained. 

** Out upon the nonsense of taking medicine 
and nostrums during the currant season I Let 
it be taught at theological seminaries that the 
currant is a * means of grace. * It is a correc- 
tive, and that is what average humanity most 
needs.''— i^. P, Roe, in '* The Home Acre:' 

Apple Water.— Mash two baked apples with 
a fork, and pour over them a pint of boiling 
water ; when cool strain and sweeten to taste. 

A Glass of Cold Water in the morning be- 
fore breakfast will, in many persons, produce 
the same effect as mineral waters. 



SKIMMED MILK. 23 



MILK. 

Skimmed Milk.— In cases of intestinal dis- 
orders skimmed milk is better than pure milk, 
and in cases of disease, when fats must be omit- 
ted, it is very useful. 

The milk should stand twenty-four hours in 
a cool place, and all the cream which has risen 
should be carefully skimmed off. 

Buttermilk.— The author, who is an inveter- 
ate smoker, has for years drank buttermilk be- 
fore retiring, and during the day whenever it can 
be obtained. He is convinced that it neutral- 
izes the effects of the nicotine from the tobacco. 
The Journal of Health says : * * Buttermilk is ex- 
cellent for weak or delicate stomachs, and far 
better as a dinner drink than coffee, tea, or 
water, and, unlike them, does not retard, but 
rather aids, digestion. A celebrated physician 
once said that if every one knew the value of 
buttermilk as a drink, it would be more freely 
partaken of by persons who drink so excessively 
of other beverages ; and, further, compared its 
effects upon the system to the clearing out of a 
cook-stove that has been clogged up with ashes 
that have sifted through, filling up every crevice 
and crack, saying that the human system is like 




24 MILK. 

the stove, and collects and gathers refuse matter 
that can in no way be exterminated from the 
system so effectually as by drinking buttermilk. 
It is also a specific remedy for indigestion, 
soothes and quiets the nerves, and is very som- 
nolent to those who are troubled with sleepless- 
ness. 

** Every one who values good health should 
drink buttermilk every day in warm weather, 
and let tea, coffee, and water alone. For the 
benefit of those who are not already aware of it, 
I may add that in the churning the first process 
of digestion is gone through, making it one of 
the easiest and quickest of all things to digest. 
It makes gastric juice, and contains properties 
that readily assimilate with it, with little or no 
wear upon the digestive organs." 

Milk, pure and simple, is a natural food, and 
should enter into the diet of adults as well as 
children. Lime-water is usually added to milk 
when the acidity of the stomach causes the latter 
to be rejected. When lime-water is not obtain- 
able, the thorough beating of the milk with a 
fork will break the oily particles of the milk, 
causing it to digest more rapidly. 

A large glass of milk should not be given to 
children or persons of weak stomachs, for they 
are apt to use it immoderately. It should be 



^ 



FRUITS AS FOOD AND MEDICINE. 25 

drunk in small mouthfuls, and as slowly as pos- 
sible. 

The quaffing of a glass of cold milk on a hot 
day, without stopping to take breath, is a very 
dangerous proceeding. 



FRUITS AS FOOD AND MEDICINE. 

Of all the fruits with which we are blessed, the 
peach is the most delicious and digestible. 
There is nothing more palatable, wholesome, 
and medicinal than good ripe peaches. They 
should be ripe, but not over-ripe and half- 
rotten ; and of this kind they may make a part 
of either meal, or be eaten between meals ; but 
it is better to make them part of the regular 
meals. It is a mistaken idea that no fruit should 
be eaten at breakfast. It would be far better if 
our people would eat less bacon and grease at 
breakfast and more fruit. In the morning there 
is an acrid state of the secretions, and nothing 
is so well calculated to correct this as cooling 
sub-acid fruits, such as peaches, apples, etc. 
Still, some of us have been taught that eating 




26 FRUITS AS FOOD AND MEDICINE. 

fruit before breakfast is highly dangerous. 
However the idea originated, it is- certainly a 
great error, contrary to both reason and fact. 

The apple is one of the best of fruits. Baked 
or stewed apples will generally agree with the 
most delicate stomach, and are excellent medi- 
cine in many cases of sickness. Green or half- 
lipe apples stewed and sweetened are pleasant to 
the taste, cooling, nourishing, and laxative, far 
superior, in many cases, to the abominable doses 
of salts and oil usually given in fever and other 
diseases. Raw apples and dried apples stewed 
are better for constipation than liver pills. 

Oranges are very acceptable to most stomachs, 
having all the advantages of the acid alluded 
to ; but the orange juice alone should be taken, 
rejecting the pulp. 

The same may be said of lemons, pomegran- 
ates, and all that class. Lemonade is the best 
drink in fevers, and, when thickened with sugar, 
is better than syrup of squills and other nau- 
seous medicines in many cases of cough. 

Tomatoes act on the liver and bowels, and are 
much more pleasant and safe than blue pills 
and ** liver regulators." The juice should be 
used alone, rejecting the skins. 

The small seeded fruits, such as blackberries, 
figs, raspberries, currants, and strawberries, may 



EATING BEFORE SLEEPING. 27 

be classed among the best foods and medicines. 
The sugar in them is nutritious, the acid is 
cooh'ng and purifying, and the seeds are laxative. 
We would be much the gainers if we would 
look more to our orchards and gardens for our 
medicines, and less to our drug-stores. To cure 
fever or act on the kidneys, no febrifuge or diu- 
retic is superior to watermelon, which may, 
with very few exceptions, be taken in sickness 
and health in almost unlimited quantities, not 
only without injury, but with positive benefit. 
But in using them, the water or juice should be 
taken, excluding the pulp, and the melon should 
be fresh and ripe, but not over- ripe or stale. — 
Family Doctor, 



EATING BEFORE SLEEPING. 

A general impression prevails that to eat be- 
fore going to bed is an injurious and altogether 
an unwise habit. Much depends on the indi- 
vidual habits of persons ; in the case of one ac- 
customed to dine at six o'clock, and whose 
hour for retiring is nine o'clock, we must admit 
it would be unwise to partake of food before

sleep. On the other hand, the six-o' clock diner, 
whose hour for retiring is from midnight to 
3 A. M. , and whose rising hour is from 8 to 1 1 
A. M. , must eat before going to bed if he wishes 
to avoid doctors' bills and sleeplessness. The 
interval between meals is decidedly too long a 
period for fasting. Empty stomachs have much 
to do with insomnia and kindred diseases so 
prevalent among writers and other brain-work- 
ers. The languid, half-rested feeling on rising, 
and the cross, irritable peevishness of many 
when spoken to about breakfast are other symp- 
toms of altogether too long a period of fasting. 
The question of what food is the most suitable 
to eat before going to bed naturally arises. 
This must be decided by circumstances. One 
who has spent the evening in dancing or other 
exercise, naturally requires something more sub- 
stantial than one who has spent the evening in a 
quiet manner. 

Baw Oysters thoroughly masticated are easily 
digested, although weak stomachs should avoid 
condiments with them, and if the oysters are 
large, the ligament or muscle should be re- 
moved. 

Oyster Broth, stew, or soup when prepared 
with milk is acceptable at late suppers ; but the 
pernicious habit of many late diners of drinking 



PIGS FEET. 29 

cold ale and beer with cooked oysters, is one 
which the author strongly deprecates. 

Pigs' Feet when boiled until tender, then 
nicely broiled over a charcoal fire, are quite di- 
gestible, and, should Bass's ale be served with 
them, see to it that it has not been on ice, and 
is free from all evidence of carbonic-acid gas, 
which is found in the ** white label " bottling of 
Bass, making this particular brand objectionable 
for night drinking. 

Stewed Tripe with Oysters may be eaten 
at night, and a glass of very light Moselle wine 
— either still or sparkling — may be served with it 

Boiled Sweetbreads cut into slices and 
warmed up in a light sauce, or served on toast 
en hrochette, are not apt to prevent sleep, or pro- 
duce indigestion. 

Poached Eggs are easily digested, but the 
soggy toast usually served with them is some- 
thing to avoid. 

Boiled Calf's Head cut into pieces as large 
as an oyster, then fried as one would fry dough- 
nuts, and served with a sauce tartar e, is a favorite 
night dish of the author, as is also shad-roe 
stewed in cream. 

Cold Boast Beef, mutton, lamb, venison, or 
poultry, served with a dainty salad of water-

is not apt to be despised by one who sits up at 
night writing. 

A dainty surprise for the night-worker would 
be a plate of sandwiches made from thin slices 
of the breast of a cold roast canvas-back duck. 
Crisp celery may accompany the dish. Sand- 
wiches made of cold roast beef and venison are 
very nice. 

Hamburg Steak when reduced lo a pulp, 
and served raw, or but slightly singed to give it 
the appearance of being cooked, is most easily 
digested. A raw or slightly poached egg may 
be served with it. 

Raw Meat is invariably recommended in 
cases of debility when an easily digested nutri- 
ment is required. A method of treating diarrhom, 
long practised in Russia, consists in the use of 
raw meat, beaten in a mortar until all traces of 
fibre disappear. It is then seasoned to taste, 
and served in the form of sandwich. Fruit jelly 
is sometimes added to disguise the flavor of the 
meat. 

Venison Steak cooked in a chafing-dish, 
or nicely broiled over a charcoal fire, is unques- 
tionably one of the best of meats to eat late at 
night. While it does not possess the same 
nutritive value found in beef, it is more easily 
and quickly digested. 



CALF S-FOOT JELLY. 3 1 



MISCELLANEOUS. 

My only serious objection to late suppers is 
that, unless caution is exercised, one is apt to 
disarrange the stomach by drinking too much 
cold liquid, thereby preventing the food from 
digesting. A Welsh rarebit, in itself, is not so 
terrible a nightmare-producer as it has been often 
painted ; but when washed down with iced 
drinks it becomes a leathery mass of the most 
indigestible character. 

Deviled bones, chickens, kidneys, etc., when 
eaten late at night are apt to convince one who 
does not possess the digestive powers of an 
ostrich, that the name ** Deviled " is peculiarly 
appropriate ; in fact, they are dyspepsia-breed- 
ing companions to fried oysters, iced tea, and 
heavy salads. 

In conclusion I will state that each individual 
must be his own adviser as to what should be 
eaten late at night ; he should know by experi- 
ence what dishes agree with him, and not rely 
upon dogmatic health theories, which are at best 
confusing to the very people they are intended 
to benefit

great. It is therefore advisable to purchase it 
from the grocer or from caterers. 

The Hot-Water Cure.— Much has been 
written for and against this new remedial agent, 
and, in the opinion of the author, the ** fors" 
have the best of it. A goblet of hot water in the 
morning is beneficial to those who dine late the 
night before. Care must be exercised that the 
water is drawn fresh from the faucet, brought to 
boiling point, then served. 

Many are apt to serve hot water that has stood 
on the range over-night, the effect of which is 
one of nausea.

INTRODUCTORY. 

This little handbook is offered to house- 
keepers, in order that they may readily under- 
stand the popular dietetic formulas so universal- 
ly recommended by physicians, many of whom 
neglect the details of preparing the nutriment 
they prescribe, owing probably to the fact that 
all physicians are not cooks, as many of them 
were in olden, and all of them should be in 
modern, times. 

An exhaustive work on the subject of dietetics 
would naturally embrace many things, which, 
while excellent in certain diseases, would lead to 
distressing results in others. Care should there- 
fore be exercised not to administer other than 
the most simple diet until the nature of a disease 
is known, and even then the habits of the inva- 
lid should be taken into consideration. 

A nurse must always keep in view the fact 
that the great desideratum is to administer the 
most nutritious food in such form that the pa- 
tient can most easily assimilate it. 



8 INTRODUCTORY. 

One word in regard to patent medicines. 
The sick-room is not the place for experiments, 
and we trust the time is not far distant when 
all so-called remedies and alleged health foods 
and drinks shall not be permitted to be sold or 
offered for sale, until they receive the indorse- 
ment of responsible boards of health. 

The lives that are sacrificed yearly by the ad- 
ministration of soothing (?) syrups and other 
pernicious nostrums are something terrible to 
contemplate, and the most stringent laws should 
be in force regulating their sale ; in no case 
should they be sold without a physician's pre- 
scription. 

Nurses have been known to purchase these 
poisonous compounds, and clandestinely ad- 
minister them to children in their charge, 
thereby dwarfing their intellects, and, in some 
instances, actually destroying the lives of the 
children. 



BROTHS. 

Beef Broth.— A well-made beef broth con- 
tains more nutriment than the old-fashioned 
beef tea, and is therefore the best of the many 
nourishing formulas known to the sick-room. 

In appearance, also, the broth is far superior 
to the tea, which is a very important factor in 
the diet for the sick. 

The choicest piece of meat for broth is a neck 
piece. Chop bone and meat quite small, and 
see to it that there is about one third bone to 
two thirds meat. Put into a gallon crock or jar 
one pound of the meat, and add a quart of cold 
water ; cover the jar with a plate, and place 
it in a deep saucepan of water. Simmer for 
four hours, strain into a smaller saucepan, and 
boil until reduced nearly one half ; remove 
every particle of fat or scum. Now comes the 
all-important question of seasoning, wherein we 
are necessarily obliged to consult the fastidious 
tastes of the invalid. Celery-salt or a stalk of 
celery allowed to simmer in the broth is accept- 
able, and the best mode of adding pepper (when 



IO BEEF JUICE. 

it is allowed) is to let a red-pepper pod remain 
in the broth for a moment or two. Ground 
pepper is objectionable for various reasons. 
Dyspeptic patients are very apt to crave season- 
ings that cannot be taken with impunity. To 
serve beef broth, care must be exercised that it 
is not too hot ; half a cupful at a time is all that 
should be served. 

Beef Juice.— Have the dealer cut a thin slice 
of rump steak, remove the fat, and singe the 
outside slightly, then scrape it into shreds with a 
knife. Warm the beef- press by pouring hot 
water over it, dry it, and with it press out the 
juice into glass or cup. Place the cup in warm 
water, and allow the juice to become quite warm, 
and add a little salt. A warmed lemon-squeezer 
may be used instead of the press. 

Rump steak is recommended because it con- 
tains more flavor than other cuts. 

Beef Tea for Convalescents.— As the old- 
fashioned beef tea is sometimes recommended, 
we give the following recipe for its preparation : 
Shred half a pound of lean steak, let it stand in 
a pint of cold water for three quarters of an 
hour, then put both into a quart champagne 
bottle. Cut a long slit in the cork before plac- 
ing it in the bottle. Set the bottle in a sauce- 
pan of warm water, simmer one hour and a half, 



L1EBIG S EXTRACT OF BEEF. II 

and strain through a napkin into a goblet. Now 
add a teaspoonful of finely shredded raw, lean 
beef, let stand a few moments, add a little salt 
and serve. 

Liebig's Extract of Beef.— This and other 
extracts are often recommended by physicians. 

A singular fact in connection with this extract 
is that the extract made in Texas by this firm 
is, in the opinion of some of our leading physi- 
cians, worthless as nutriment, while the extract 
made in South America, by the same company, 
is highly recommended. 

The author, being somewhat surprised that 
there should be a difference, made inquiries and 
learned that to the flesh of every two vacd (fat 
cow) was added a third of the flesh of a segua, 
or mare, in making the extract. These animals 
feed on esportillo, which is a thin, reed-like 
grass, said to be very fattening. The extract 
made in the United States is prepared from beef 
only. 

Is there more nutriment in the flesh of the 
horse than in that of the cow ? 

Mutton Broth. -Although mutton possesses 
a lower degree of nutritive value than beef, it is 
nevertheless one of the most important of ani- 
mal foods, being easily digested. 

Like beef, the neck part of mutton is most 



12 VEAL BROTH. 

appropriate for the making of broth. Trim off 
the surplus fat from the piece of meat, and to a 
pound of the lean (with bone added) add a 
quart of cold water ; simmer gently for two hours, 
strain, and let it become cold. When wanted 
remove every particle of fat. Put a small quan- 
tity of it in a saucepan, and allow it to become 
quite hot ; salt slightly, and allow a red-pepper 
pod to remain in it for a moment. Have ready 
a small quantity of boiled rice, add it to the 
broth, and let stand a few moments before serv- 
ing. A very small piece of onion is sometimes 
added to the meat when first cooked to destroy 
the peculiar mutton flavor which is so objection- 
able to many patients. 

Veal Broth.— Veal, although less nutritive 
than either beef or mutton, and less digestive, is 
sometimes recommended, owing to its having a 
laxative action. The broth is prepared in a 
similar way to mutton broth. 

Chicken Broth.—" The domestic chicken," 
says Barthalow, * ' is a most important article of 
food for sick and convalescents. The taste is 
agreeable, the tissues soft and easy of mastica- 
tion and digestion. Spring chickens are more 
tender and delicate than the fully developed 
fowls of four to six months old. Next to the 
chicken in point of digestibility is the domestic 



SCALLOP BROTH. 13 

turkey, and after this the domestic goose and 
duck." Cut up half a chicken into neat pieces ; 
add a quart of cold water and a small piece of 
celery ; cover and boil slowly for two hours. 
Then remove all fat carefully, strain, add salt, 
and serve. If rice is used, boil it with the 
chicken, and add it half an hour before the 
chicken is cooked. 

Scallop Broth.— The peculiar flavor of scal- 
lops is quite atrractive to the convalescent, and 
a broth made from them is nourishing ; but care 
should be exercised in selecting the shell fish. 
To improve their appearance, shippers add 
quantities of salaeratus to the scallops, which has 
the effect of bleaching them and increasing their 
size j this custom may please the dealers, but not 
consumers. Select medium -sized scallops of a 
natural creamy color, wash them, and cut them 
into small pieces. To a half a pint of these add 
half a pint of warm water and half a pint of 
milk, a " pea" of butter, and a pinch of salt ; 
simmer for twenty minutes ; strain and serve. 

A pint of milk and no water may be used if 
the patient desires it. 



14 OATMEAL GRUEL. 



GRUELS. 



Oatmeal Gruel. — Oatmeal, in any form, 
should not be given to patients who are suffering 
from diarrhoeal diseases or of irritable mucous 
membrane. While it is rich in nutriment, it is 
not always a good food, because it is irritating. 

Dr. Mott says that while many are under the 
impression that oatmeal is a true laxative, it is 
not properly so. Sift two ounces of oatmeal. 
Boil a quart and a pint of water, add to it a salt- 
spoonful of salt ; now add gradually the oat- 
meal, stirring constantly while adding the meal. 
Boil for one hour, remove to the back of the 
range until water enough has evaporated to 
make it of the proper consistency ; part milk 
may be used instead of all water. 

This recipe calls for the " old process" mill- 
ing, which requires much longer cooking than 
the new preparations now on the market, many 
of which are advertised as being partly cooked, 
requiring but a few moments' more cooking to 
convert them into the most excellent food. 

Housekeepers, when preparing oatmeal for 
delicate stomachs, should ignore the ten, or even 
twenty-minute, propositions, and cook these 
preparations at least one hour. 



CEREALINE GRUEL. I 5 

Cerealine Gruel.— Proceed as for oatmeal 
gruel, and add half a pint of cerealine to a quart 
of boiling water, slightly salted. Boil for half 
an hour, and serve with a little sugar. All milk 
may be used, if desired. 

Rice Gruel.— Mix together one tablespoonful 
of rice- floor, a saltspoonful of salt, and a small 
cup of cold water. Add the contents of the 
cup to a pint of boiling water, and boil for 
twenty minutes. Sugar should be served sep- 
arately, and, when too thick, add milk until of 
the proper consistency. 

Arrow-Root Gruel.— Take one tablespoon- 
ful of arrow- root, a pinch of salt, and half a gill 
of cold water, stir into half a pint of boiling 
water, and boil for fifteen minutes. 

Barley Gruel.— Take two tablespoonfuls of 
pearl barley washed in warm water. To a 
quart and half a pint of cold water add a heap- 
ing saltspoonful of salt and the washed barley. 
Boil for three quarters of an hour ; strain ; add a 
cake of cut sugar to each gobletful, and twist 
over the glass a piece of lemon-peel, the oil of 
which gives a pleasant flavor. 

Barley Water.— Wash one ounce of pearl 
barley in cold water. Drain off the water, and 
add to a quart and a pint of boiling water the 
barley, a piece of lemon- peel, and sugar enough 



1 6 RICE WATER. 

to be just perceptible to the taste ; simmer on 
back of range until reduced one half, and serve 
unstrained. Other harmless flavoring ingredi- 
ents may be used instead of the lemon. 

Bice Water.— To a quart and a pint of cold 
water add two ounces of well-washed rice ; salt 
slightly, and add two cakes of sugar. Boil in 
the double saucepan until the rice has dissolved. 
Flavor with lemon-peel or stick cinnamon. 

A palatable jelly is made by straining the 
liquid, and flavoring it with lemon, wine, or 
brandy, then poured into moulds and placed on 
ice. 

Alcohol, in any form, should not be allowed 
patients except under medical advice. 



I? 



TOAST. 

Toast is very palatable and digestible when 
properly prepared. Many seem to think that 
they have made toast when they brown the out- 
side of a slice of bread. Have they ? 

The object in making toast is to evaporate all 
moisture from the bread, and holding a slice 
over the fire to singe does not accomplish this ; 
it only warms the moisture, making the inside 
of the bread doughy and decidedly indigestible. 
The true way of preparing it is to cut the bread 
into slices a quarter of an inch thick, trim off 
all crust, put the slices in a pan or plate, place 
them in the oven — which must not be too hot — 
take them out when a delicate brown, and butter 
at once. 

For my own use I dry all home-made bread 
in this manner. 

Dry Toast should be served within the folds 
of a napkin if you wish to keep it hot ; toast- 
racks allow the heat to escape, and they are not 
xecommended. 

Dip Toast.— Prepare the toast as above 
directed ; dip the edges into hot water quickly, 
and butter at once. This is also called water 
toast. 



1 8 MILK TOAST. 

Miik Toast— Wet the pan to be used with 
cold water, which prevents burning. Melt an 
ounce of floured butter ; whisk into it a pint of 
hot milk ; add a little salt ; simmer. Prepare 
four slices of toast ; put them in a deep dish 
one at a time ; pour a little of the milk over 
each, and over the last one pour the remainder 
of the milk. 

Anchovy Toast.— The best way to prepare 
this appetizing dish is as follows : Toast the 
bread and trim it neatly, and place it near the 
range to keep warm ; next prepare a " dip," as 
for ordinary cream toast ; spread a thin layer of 
anchovy paste on each slice of bread ; place in 
a hot, deep dish ; pour the prepared cream over 
them, and serve. 

Clam Toast.— Chop up two dozen small 
clams into fine pieces ; simmer for thirty min- 
utes in hot water enough to cover them. Beat 
up the yolks of two eggs ; add a little cayenne 
and a gill of w r armed milk ; dissolve half a tea- 
spoonful of flour in a little cold milk ; simmer 
all together ; pour over buttered toast, and 
serve. 

Marrow-bone Toast.— Procure two beef 
shin-bones about six to eight inches long ; cover 
them with dough, and wrap them in muslin ; 
pour hot water enough to cover them, and boil 



OYSTER TOAST. 



J 9 



for an hour and a half. Remove cloth and 
dough ; shake or draw out the marrow with a 
long-handled fork upon slices of hot toast. 
Add salt, cayenne, and, if convenient, a little 
chopped celery, and serve. 

Oyster Toast.— Select fifteen plump oys- 
ters ; chop them fine, and add salt, pepper, and 
a suspicion of nutmeg. Beat up the yolks of 
two eggs with a gill of cream ; whisk this into 
the simmering oysters. When set, pour the 
whole over slices of buttered toast. 

Salmon Toast.— It very often occurs that a 
can of salmon is not all used at a meal, and yet 
there is not quite enough for another meal with- 
out other dishes or ingredients added to it. 
Should this occur, mince the salmon, heat, and 
season it and serve it on toast. A poached 
egg added to it is quite acceptable. 

Tongue Toast.— A very nice dish is pre- 
pared from cold boiled or potted tongue. Slice 
the tongue, and cut each slice into small, fine 
pieces ; heat it in a pan with a little butter. To 
prevent burning, moisten with warm water or 
clear soup ; add salt and pepper ; stir into it 
two beaten eggs. When set, arrange neatly on 
toast. 

Dainty bits of roast game, fowl, etc. , minced, 
warmed over, and served on toast are excellent. 



20 FKAPPE CHAMPAGNE, 



DIET DRINKS. 



Frappe Champagne renders important ser- 
vice in irritable states of the stomach, especially 
in sea-sickness, vomiting of pregnancy, yellow- 
fever, cholera morbus, and cholera. To pro- 
duce frappe champagne quickly, proceed as fol- 
lows : Put into a metal wine-cooler, or any 
other metal receptacle, a bottle of dry cham- 
pagne, surround it with alternate layers of rock 
salt and cracked ice, place the cooler on the hot 
range, and the rapid melting of the ice will so- 
lidify the wine in five minutes ; if allowed to re- 
main a longer period the wine will become solid, 
and refuse to leave its glassy prison. 

When we take into consideration the fact that 
by the old method of revolving the wine in its 
icy walls, a period of thirty minutes is required 
to frappe it, the above phenomenal method 
of producing the desired result will be appre- 
ciated. 

Sparkling wines, as a rule, are more seda- 
tive to the stomach, and more intoxicating 
relatively to their alcoholic strength than still 
wines. 

Sweet champagnes contain a vast quantity of 
unappropriated sugar. When such wines are 



WINE WHEY. 21 

used they produce acid fermentation, and acidity 
with headache quite naturally follows. 

Agents of sweet champagnes wear out their 
vocal chords telling their patrons to serve wines 
as cold as possible ; in this way the sugar is not 
easily detected, and a large sale of particular 
brands is the result. But let me warn my read- 
ers who use champagne that a fine dry cham- 
pagne is almost ruined by the low temperature 
at which it is usually served at restaurants, re- 
ceptions, etc. A very cold champagne is a dan- 
gerous tipple for even a healthy stomach, espe- 
cially near bedtime. 

Wine Whey.— Boil a pint of sweet milk and 
add half a gill of sherry. Let it simmer for 
fifteen minutes, skim off the curd, add a gill of 
sherry, and remove curd as it rises. Straining 
may be necessary -to remove the curd entirely. 
Sweeten. 

Eggnog.— Scald half a pint of milk ; when 
cold add one egg well beaten, two teaspoonfuls 
of sugar, and a tablespoonful of choice brandy. 
Shake or beat the mixture with a fork. This 
formula is only intended for invalids, and is not 
the recipe used in cafes. 

Sherry and Egg.— Beat up one egg thor- 
oughly, add a teaspoonful of sugar, and a wine 
glass full of dry sherry. 



2 2 CURRANT- JELLY WATER. 



FRUIT DRINKS. 

Currant- Jelly V/ater. -Dissolve a teaspoon - 
ful of currant-jelly in a goblet of cold water, 
and add one cake of cut sugar. 

Currant "Water.— Simmer gently for ten 
minutes a pint of fresh-picked currants in a 
quart of water, add a heaping tablespoonful of 
powdered sugar, and, when cold, strain. There 
is a little economy in adding the sugar after the 
juice is strained. 

11 Out upon the nonsense of taking medicine 
and nostrums during the currant season ! Let 
it be taught at theological seminaries that the 
currant is a ' means of grace. ' It is a correc- 
tive, and that is what average humanity most 
needs." — E. P. Roe, in *' The Home Acre. 11 

Apple Water.— Mash two baked apples with 
a fork, and pour over them a pint of boiling 
water ; when cool strain and sweeten to taste. 

A Glass of Cold "Water in the morning be- 
fore breakfast will, in many persons, produce 
the same effect as mineral waters. 



SKIMMED MILK.. 



MILK. 



23 



Skimmed Milk. -In cases of intestinal dis- 
orders skimmed milk is better than pure milk, 
and in cases of disease, when fats must be omit- 
ted, it is very useful. 

The milk should stand twenty-four hours in 
a cool place, and all the cream which has risen 
should be carefully skimmed off. 

Buttermilk.-The author, who is an inveter- 
ate smoker, has for years drank buttermilk be- 
fore retiring, and during the day whenever it can 
be obtained. He is convinced that it neutral- 
izes the effects of the nicotine from the tobacco. 
Tte Journal of Health says : " Buttermilk is ex- 
cellent for weak or delicate stomachs, and far 
better as a dinner drink than coffee, tea or 
water, and, unlike them, does not retard, but 
rather aids, digestion. A celebrated physician 
once said that if every one knew the value of 
buttermilk as a drink, it would be more free y 
partaken of by persons who drink so excessively 
of other beverages ; and, further, compared its 
effects upon the system to the clearing cut of a 
cook-stove that has been clogged up with ashes 
that have sifted through, filling up every crevice 
and crack, saving that the human system is like 



24 MILK. 

the stove, and collects and gathers refuse matter 
that can in no way be exterminated from the 
system so effectually as by drinking buttermilk. 
It is also a specific remedy for indigestion, 
soothes and quiets the nerves, and is very som- 
nolent to those who are troubled with sleepless- 
ness. 

" Every one who values good health should 
drink buttermilk every day in warm weather, 
and let tea, coffee, and water alone. For the 
benefit of those who are not already aware of it, 
I may add that in the churning the first process 
of digestion is gone through, making it one of 
the easiest and quickest of all things to digest. 
It makes gastric juice, and contains properties 
that readily assimilate with it, with little or no 
wear upon the digestive organs." 

Milk, pure and simple, is a natural food, and 
should enter into the diet of adults as well as 
children. Lime-water is usually added to milk 
when the acidity of the stomach causes the latter 
to be rejected. When lime water is not obtain- 
able, the thorough beating of the milk with a 
fork will break the oily particles of the milk, 
causing it to digest more rapidly. 

A large glass of milk should not be given to 
children or persons of weak stomachs, for they 
are apt to use it immoderately. It should be 



FRUITS AS FOOD AND MEDICINE. 25 

drunk in small mouthfuls, and as slowly as pos- 
sible. 

The quaffing of a glass of cold milk on a hot 
day, without stopping to take breath, is a very 
dangerous proceeding. 



FRUITS AS FOOD AND MEDICINE. 

Of all the fruits with which we are blessed, the 
peach is the most delicious and digestible. 
There is nothing more palatable, wholesome, 
and medicinal than good ripe peaches. They 
should be ripe, but not over-ripe and half- 
rotten ; and of this kind they may make a part 
of either meal, or be eaten between meals ; but 
it is better to make them part of the regular 
meals. It is a mistaken idea that no fruit should 
be eaten at breakfast. It would be far better if 
our people would eat less bacon and grease at 
breakfast and more fruit. In the morning there 
is an acrid state of the secretions, and nothing 
is so well calculated to correct this as cooling 
sub-acid fruits, such as peaches, apples, etc. 
Still, some of us have been taught that eating 



2 FRUITS AS FOOD AND MEDICINE. 

fruit before breakfast is highly dangerous. 
However the idea originated, it is certainly a 
great error, contrary to both reason and fact. 

The apple is one of the best of fruits. Baked 
or stewed apples will generally agree with the 
most delicate stomach, and are excellent medi- 
cine in many cases of sickness. Green or half- 
ripe apples stewed and sweetened are pleasant to 
the taste, cooling, nourishing, and laxative, far 
superior, in many cases, to the abominable doses 
of salts and oil usually given in fever and other 
diseases. Raw apples and dried apples stewed 
are better for constipation than liver pills. 

Oranges are very acceptable to most stomachs, 
having all the advantages of the acid alluded 
to ; but the orange juice alone should be taken, 
rejecting the pulp. 

The same may be said of lemons, pomegran- 
ates, and all that class. Lemonade is the best 
drink in fevers, and, when thickened with sugar, 
is better than syrup of squills and other nau- 
seous medicines in many cases of cough. 

Tomatoes act on the liver and bowels, and are 
much more pleasant and safe than blue pills 
and " liver regulators." The juice should be 
used alone, rejecting the skins. 

The small seeded fruits, such as blackberries, 
figs, raspberries, currants, and strawberries, may 



EATING BEFORE SLEEPING. 27 

be classed among the best foods and medicines. 
The sugar in them is nutritious, the acid is 
cooling and purifying, and the seeds are laxative. 
We would be much the gainers if we would 
look more to our orchards and gardens for our 
medicines, and less to our drug-stores. To cure 
fever or act on the kidneys, no febrifuge or diu- 
retic is superior to watermelon, which may, 
with very few exceptions, be taken in sickness 
and health in almost unlimited quantities, not 
only without injury, but with positive benefit. 
But in using them, the water or juice should be 
taken, excluding the pulp, and the melon should 
be fresh and ripe, but not over-ripe or stale. — 
Family Doctor. 



EATING BEFORE SLEEPING. 

A general impression prevails that to eat be- 
fore going to bed is an injurious and altogether 
an unwise habit. Much depends on the indi- 
vidual habits of persons ; in the case of one ac- 
customed to dine at six o'clock, and whose 
hour for retiring is nine o'clock, we must admit 
it would be unwise to partake of food before 



28 RAW OYSTERS. 

sleep. On the other hand, the six-o'clock diner, 
whose hour for retiring is from midnight to 
3 a.m., and whose rising hour is from 8 to n 
a. m. , must eat before going to bed if he wishes 
to avoid doctors' bills and sleeplessness. The 
interval between meals is decidedly too long a 
period for fasting. Empty stomachs have much 
to do with insomnia and kindred diseases so 
prevalent among writers and other brain-work- 
ers. The languid, half-rested feeling on rising, 
and the cross, irritable peevishness of many 
when spoken to about breakfast are other symp- 
toms of altogether too long a period of fasting. 
The question of what iood is the most suitable 
to eat before going to bed naturally arises. 
This must be decided by circumstances. One 
who has spent the evening in dancing or other 
exercise, naturally requires something more sub- 
stantial than one who has spent the evening in a 
quiet manner. 

Raw Oysters thoroughly masticated are easily 
digested, although weak stomachs should avoid 
condiments with them, and if the oysters are 
large, the ligament or muscle should be re- 
moved. 

Oyster Broth, stew, or soup when prepared 
with milk is acceptable at late suppers ; but the 
pernicious habit of many late diners of drinking 



PIGS FEET. 29 

cold ale and beer with cooked oysters, is one 
which the author strongly deprecates. 

Pigs' Feet when boiled until tender, then 
nicely broiled over a charcoal fire, are quite di- 
gestible, and, should Bass's ale be served with 
them, see to it that it has not been on ice, and 
is free from all evidence of carbonic-acid gas, 
which is found in the " white label " bottling of 
Bass, making this particular brand objectionable 
for night drinking. 

Stewed Tripe with Oysters may be eaten 
at night, and a glass of very light Moselle wine 
— either still or sparkling — may be served with it. 

Boiled Sweetbreads-cut into slices and 
warmed up in a light sauce, or served on toast 
en brochette, are not apt to prevent sleep, or pro- 
duce indigestion. 

Poached Eggs are easily digested, but the 
soggy toast usually served with them is some- 
thing to avoid. 

Boiled Calf's Head cut into pieces as large 
as an oyster, then fried as one would fry dough- 
nuts, and served with a sauce tartare, is a favorite 
night dish of the author, as is also shad-roe 
stewed in cream. 

Cold Roast Beef, mutton, lamb, venison, or 
poultry, served with a dainty salad of water- 
cress, or escarale, and a glass of generous claret, 



30 HAMBURG STEAK. 

is not apt to be despised by one who sits up at 
night writing. 

A dainty surprise for the night-worker would 
be a plate of sandwiches made from thin slices 
of the breast of a cold roast canvas-back duck. 
Crisp celery may accompany the dish. Sand- 
wiches made of cold roast beef and venison are 
very nice. 

Hamburg Steak when reduced ro a pulp, 
and served raw, or but slightly singed to give it 
the appearance of being cooked, is most easily 
digested. A raw or slightly poached egg may 
be served with it. 

Raw Moat is invariably recommended in 
cases of debility when an easily digested nutri- 
ment is required. A method of treating diarrhoea, 
long practised in Prussia, consists in the use of 
raw meat, beaten in a mortar until all traces of 
fibre disappear. It is then seasoned to taste, 
and served in the form of sandwich. Fruit jelly 
is sometimes added to disguise the flavor of the 
meat. 

Venison Steak cooked in a chafing-dish, 
or nicely broiled over a charcoal fire, is unques- 
tionably one of the best of meats to eat late at 
night. While it does not possess the same 
nutritive value found in beef, it is more easily 
and quickly digested. 



CALF S-FOOT JELLY. 3 I 



MISCELLANEOUS. 



My only serious objection to late suppers is 
that, unless caution is exercised, one is apt to 
disarrange the stomach by drinking too much 
cold liquid, thereby preventing the food from 
digesting. A Welsh rarebit, in itself, is not so 
terrible a nightmare-producer as it has been often 
painted ; but when washed down with iced 
drinks it becomes a leathery mass of the most 
indigestible character. 

Deviled bones, chickens, kidneys, etc., when 
eaten late at night are apt to convince one who 
does not possess the digestive powers of an 
ostrich, that the name " Deviled " is peculiarly 
appropriate ; in fact, they are dyspepsia-breed- 
ing companions to fried oysters, iced tea, and 
heavy salads. 

In conclusion I will state that each individual 
must be his own adviser as to what should be 
eaten late at night ; he should know by experi- 
ence what dishes agree with him, and not rely 
upon dogmatic health theories, which are at best 
confusing to the very people they are intended 
to benefit. 

Calf 's-foot Jelly.— The trouble and expense 
of preparing calf s-foot jelly at home is too

great. It is therefore advisable to purchase it 
from the grocer or from caterers. 

The Hot-Water Cure.— Much has been 
written for and against this new remedial agent, 
and, in the opinion of the author, the " fors" 
have the best of it. A goblet of hot water in the 
morning is beneficial to those who dine late the 
night before. Care must be exercised that the 
water is drawn fresh from the faucet, brought to 
boiling point, then served. 

Many are apt to serve hot water that has stood 
on the range over-night, the effect of which is 
one of nausea.
