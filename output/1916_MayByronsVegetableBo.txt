This is a digital copy of a book that was preserved for generations on library shelves before it was carefully scanned by Google as part of a project 
to make the world's books discoverable online. 

It has survived long enough for the copyright to expire and the book to enter the public domain. A public domain book is one that was never subject 
to copyright or whose legal copyright term has expired. Whether a book is in the public domain may vary country to country. Public domain books 
are our gateways to the past, representing a wealth of history, culture and knowledge that's often difficult to discover. 

Marks, notations and other marginalia present in the original volume will appear in this file - a reminder of this book's long journey from the 
publisher to a library and finally to you. 

Usage guidelines 

Google is proud to partner with libraries to digitize public domain materials and make them widely accessible. Public domain books belong to the 
public and we are merely their custodians. Nevertheless, this work is expensive, so in order to keep providing this resource, we have taken steps to 
prevent abuse by commercial parties, including placing technical restrictions on automated querying. 

We also ask that you: 

+ Make non-commercial use of the files We designed Google Book Search for use by individuals, and we request that you use these files for 
personal, non-commercial purposes. 

+ Refrain from automated querying Do not send automated queries of any sort to Google's system: If you are conducting research on machine 
translation, optical character recognition or other areas where access to a large amount of text is helpful, please contact us. We encourage the 
use of public domain materials for these purposes and may be able to help. 

+ Maintain attribution The Google "watermark" you see on each file is essential for informing people about this project and helping them find 
additional materials through Google Book Search. Please do not remove it. 

+ Keep it legal Whatever your use, remember that you are responsible for ensuring that what you are doing is legal. Do not assume that just 
because we believe a book is in the public domain for users in the United States, that the work is also in the public domain for users in other 
countries. Whether a book is still in copyright varies from country to country, and we can't offer guidance on whether any specific use of 
any specific book is allowed. Please do not assume that a book's appearance in Google Book Search means it can be used in any manner 
anywhere in the world. Copyright infringement liability can be quite severe. 

About Google Book Search 

Google's mission is to organize the world's information and to make it universally accessible and useful. Google Book Search helps readers 
discover the world's books while helping authors and publishers reach new audiences. You can search through the full text of this book on the web

CHAPTER I 

NOTES AND HINTS 

Thm word Vegekible is a wide one» loosely used. 
It may simply mean something that grows out of 
the euthy as distinguished from something animal 
that walks about on the earth, or something mineral, 
which (to all appearances, but these are deceptive) 
doesn't either move or grow. If you look in a 
dictionary, that (as usual) confuses the matter still 
more, for it says that vegekMe is from the Latin 
vegdua, or lively (I), and vegere, to move or 
quicken (II), and vegdabUis, animating (I!!). There 
couldn't be anything farther removed from one's 
ordinary notions of a vegetable. However, on 
mature consideration, one is brought back to the 
idea that a vegetable has grown, moved, developed 
out of the earth, just as I said at first. I refuse 
to call it lively, but we must allow that it has 
** growed." And as to " animating " — ^well, Huxley 
said that every plant was a spirit confined in a 
wooden case. Pythagoras forbade his disciples to 
eat beans, because of his peculiar doctrines about 
the transmigration of souls. . . . We are wandering 
away from the point, and getting into deep waters. 
Let me restrict myself by stating that this book 
deals with

onions ; or stalks, like celery. They may be tubers, 
like potatoes ; or fruits, like tomatoes ; or thistle- 
heads, like globe artichokes ; or seeds, like peas ; 
or flowers, like broccoli. The central fact about 
them all is that they can be eaten, and they (mostly) 
must be cooked. 

The use of vegetables as eatables is a singularly 
intermittent affair. Roughly speaking, it is confined 
as a rule to the hotter countries, and the poorer 
peoples. It is a result of poverty, of climate, or of 
ultra-civilisation ; for man in an aboriginal condition 
eats flesh meat if he can get it. Roots and fruits 
and leaves are not his primary idea of food. The 
" green herb of the field " ceased to be his natural 
sustenance at a given prehistoric period. Still, 
there are wild tribes who cultivate grains and 
vegetables of sorts — ^because flesh meat is so scarce 
for them. 

The oldest vegetables, from a gardening point of 
view, are, so far as I can ascertain, (1) the Cucur- 
bitacecB — gourds, melons, cucumbers, etc. (which, of 
course, are, properly speaking, fruits) — known to 
the Semitic rctces, the ancient Egyptians, and the 
American aborigines; (2) the Legumino6<B — ^peas, 
beans, lentils — ^which were known to the Bronze 
Age people, and immensely popular with the Semitic 
and Egyptian razees, not to mention the earliest 
Oreeks and Romans ; (3) the Allium or Onion tribe 
(belonging to the Liluzcece), of practically similar 
antiquity ; (4) the Brassicce or CSabbage family ; 
(5) root vegetables, such as parsnips, carrots, 
beets, etc. ; (6) asparagus ; (7) skirrets ; (8) po- 
tatoes and Jerusalem artichokes. The above, of 
course, is only a rough r^um6, and further par- 
ticulars will be found in the Notes attached to each 
vegetable throughout this book. 

Li Europe, with the fall of the Roman empire, 
vegetables seem to have declined in popular favour ;

and, apparently, they did not regain their old 
footing until after the Renaissance. The spread 
of classic literature was also the spread of classic 
vegetables. Exhumed out of long neglect, from 
the fourteenth century onward, one finds vegetables 
being more and more cultivated, and slowly, very 
slowly introduced from one country to another. 
We, after our usual habit, were the last of all 
to profit by these developments, although a large 
number of the vegetables in question already grew 
freely as wildings in this fruitful isle. 

Our ancestors of the Middle Ages — such as were 
well-to-do — did not, indeed, take much notice of 
vegetables, except as salads. The robust iMxd 
sturdy Elizabethans added copious " salletings " to 
their bill of fare, but even the potato was at first 
regarded as a mere medium for conveying the 
Elizabethans' beloved and aU-important sugariness. 
They expended their ingenuity and their appetite 
upon fish, flesh, and fowl, elaborately spiced and 
seasoned ; all very well for those to eat vegetables 
who could get nothing better. Gerarde experi- 
mented, in his Holborn garden, with the "love- 
apple," or tomato ; Parkinson interested himself in 
new and rare productions like the cauliflower. But 
those who could afford it, preferred meat ; and 
ginger was " hot i' the mouth, too," with most meat 
dishes. 

Meanwhile the poor folk made shift to eke out 
their scanty meals with any sort of greenstuff. 
I have myself spoken with a man who, in his child- 
hood, before the repeal of the Com Laws, had sub- 
sisted largely on cWlock, young nettles, and other 
such free gifts of field and hedgerow. 

During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, 
culinary vegetables became a continually more fre- 
quent addition to the dinner-table ; during the nine- 
teenth century they reached, perhaps, their iwAxifr^^^T^

of variety, for a great many which were cultivated 
for a decade or so after the '' hungry Forties " have 
dropped out of use, and have not been replaced by 
new ones. The list available in the greengrocer's 
shop, like the number of individual vegetables 
grown in the average garden, is quite extraordinary 
in its limitations. On the Continent, and in the 
United States, a much wider range is proffered. 

But whereas in former days a vegetable was 
strictly seasonal, so that you could not obtain, let 
us say, a new potato born out of due time, nowadays 
the seasons are very nearly negligible, by reason of 
(a) foreign products and (6) improved methods of 
storage. I don't maintain for a moment that the 
expensive forced vegetable is half so good as that 
which arrives naturally at its authentic date. The 
former seems to have missed just that much of sun 
and rain and sweet influences which went to 
make up the latter. And the stored vegetable 
cannot, in reason, be equal to the fresh one : we 
may here except potatoes. 

The fact remains, however, that owing to aU 
these increased facilities, strict vegetarianism has 
become, not only a fad or a fashion, but a cult and 
an obsession with very many people. Some per- 
sons it suits; some it doesn't. You cannot tell 
till you have tried. In any case it is no use dog- 
matising : chcumn d son gout. 

Although this book is not written for the professed 
and rigid vegetarian (for some such might cavil at 
the meat stock and animal butter employed in 
many of the recipes), yet the professed vegetarian 
will find it of considerable value in the number 
and interest of dishes here presented ; whilst the 
ordinary housewife, desirous of combining variety 
with economy, and pleasing her family into the 
bargain, will here find suggestion of the widest 
scope— of which the gardener may also take

advantage, in supplying her with something more 
liberal in his seasonal range of foodstu£Fs. The 
present enhanced price of meat makes the wise 
choice of satisfying vegetables a matter of extreme 
importance. 

The following rough list will give some notion 
of the respective value of vegetables from a nutritious 
point of view — i.e. regarding them as quality rather 
than as quantity. 

1. Potatoes. 

2. Jerusalem Artichokes. 

3. Parsnips. 

4. Peas, Beans, Lentils. 

5. Beets and Carrots. 

6. Onions and Leeks. 

7. Celery, Seakale, Salsify. 

8. Cauliflower and Broccoli. 

9. Green Vegetables in general. 
10. Everything else. 

A FEW DON'TS 

(1) Don't boil any vegetable if you can steam it. 

(2) Don't use any more water than you can possi- 
bly help, if you must boil the vegetable: let it 
cook in its own juices so far as possible. 

(3) Don't throw away the water thus used c it 
contains much of the essential salts of the vegetable. 
Use it for stock or sauce, that same day if you can. 

(4) Don't put any vegetable into cold water to 
oook it, except potatoes (old) and Jerusalem arti- 
chokes. Put it into fast-boiling water. 

(5) Don't forget to salt the water c it makes all 
the difference to the flavour of the vegetables. 

(6) Don't use washing soda on any account : use 
(if absolutely necessary on account of the hardness 
of the water) a minute pinch of bicarbonate of 
sodar— about what would cover a threepenny-bit.

6 MAY BYRON'S VEGETABLE BOOK 

(7) Don't throw away peelings, paring8»,trinuning8 
or any vegetable matter. Wrap them up tightly in 
an old newspaper, let them become fairly dry, and 
use them as fuel. 

(8) Don't dump the vegetable into the dish all 
wet. Strain and drain out the moisture as com- 
pletely and as quickly as you can, but so as not 
either to spoil the shape and appearance of the 
vegetable, or to let it get cold. 

(9) Don't put it into a cold dish unless it is to 
be served cold. A hot thing put into a cold dish is 
one of the most unpardonable crimes in cookery t 
and it is "worse than a crime — ^it is a blunder," 
likely to undo all your trouble and spoil the whol« 
thing. 

(10) Don't despise any left-over vegetables, how- 
ever small. They can all be used up for salads, 
stews, or soups : only don't leave them to become 
stale or sour, especially such as have been served 
in sauce. 

ADVICE IN GENERAL 

Vegetables should be gathered early in the morn- 
ing, and kept in a cool dark place ; to put them in 
a clean dry pail, covered with paper, is a very good 
plan. 

If you are not lucky enough to grow your own 
v^etables, buy them as fresh as you can ; and 
never keep any till the next day before using. You 
don't know how long they may have been knocking 
about in market-carts and markets, collecting germs 
and getting flabbier every minufie. 

Green vegetables which are flabby and discoloured 
are not worth cooking, neither are root vegetables 
which are limp and stale. The first should be crisp 
and green, the second firm and stiff. 

To draw out and kill slugs, caterpillars, etc., in

o 
cabbage and cauliflower, add a little vinegar^to the 

water you soak them in while preparing them. 

Boot vegetables should be cooked in a covered 
pan ; but all green leaf vegetables, except spinach, 
are best cooked with the lid off. Green vegetables 
must be boiled very fast, and never allowed to go 
off the boil. 

Any unpleasant smell proceeding from vegetables 
during their boiling can be obviated by changing 
the water during the cooking, but by so doing you 
will waste a good deal of the mineral salts. A better 
plan is to put a piece of toasted crust in a little 
muslin bag, along with the vegetable. 

Be sure to drain all vegetables thoroughly after 
cooking, as quickly as possible. 

Nothing is more unappetising than cold or luke- 
warm vegetables ; take care, therefore, to serve, 
them hot in ^ hot dish with a hot cover. Quite 
commonly a careless cook will plank down her 
vegetables into a chilly or tepid dish. 

There is no vegetable whatever (and this especi- 
ally applies to roots and tubers) but what is greatly 
improved by the addition of a good sauce, served 
separately or otherwise.

The above is for boiling. For steaming, you

rather more. 

THE VALUE OF STEAMING 

It has been well said that " a v^etable is not 
merely so much bulk to stuff into the human frame. 
It contains varying proportions of certain consti- 
tu^its necessary for the support of healthy life — 
nitrogenous, mineral, sugary, starchy matter, etc., 
etc. You want to preserve as much of these as 
possible, and not to waste any." Steamed vege- 
tables only incur one-third of the loss which is in- 
curred by boiling. But boiled vegetables lose 
enormously; from one-third of the total food 
material (in the case of cabbages) to an incredible 
wastage in the case of peeled and boiled potatoes. 

All the value which goes into the water in boiling, 
moreover, is actually lost, unless it is reserved for 
vegetable stock. If, therefore, you must boil a 
vegetable, use as little water as possible. 

In the case of spinach and other leaves of similar 
calibre, no water at all is necessary : they can be 
oooked in their own moisture.

But steaming not only Baves lAvalaable mineral 
salts and food material, it retains the individual 
flavour of a vegetable, and its shape and form, in 
a way which boiling can never do. 

By using a large steamer with at least two com- 
partments, you will save space, gas, and coal, and 
the principal values of your vegetables. If you 
haven't a steamer, make one by a " contraption " : 
a colander over a pan of boiling water will do, so long 
(M it is covered closely. This is most important. 
None of the steam must be suffered to escape. You 
must be careful, however, to replenish the water as 
it boils away, and to keep it continually boiling. 
Steamed vegetables will take nearly twice as Icoig 
to cook as boiled ones ; but they will be worth nearly 
three times as much, regarded as food. Very much 
more in the case of potatoes. 

The recipes in this book chiefly indicate boiling : 
they also often indicate a lot of water, because 
they are collected from a vast variety of sources, 
and the original belief in boiling dies hard. But our 
thrifty continental neighbours would hardly credit 
the wastage that has gone on over here, all these 
centuries, in the matter of vegetable " stock," and 
I hope that hard times may have ike effect of teach- 
ing us wisdom and economy in this respect.

CHAPTER n 

VEGETABLES, COOKED PLAINLY 
OR ELABORATELY 

ARTICHOKES (GLOBE) 

NoTB. — ^The Globe Artichoke — bo little grown now- 
adaySy regarded as a rarity and a luxury — can boast 
itseU of immeasurable antiquity. Its name is 
derived from the Arabic AUcharshuf. It is not only 
one of the oldest cultivated vegetables in the world, 
it is the artichoke, and all others are merely so-called 
because of their fancied resemblance in flavour to 
this one. The Greeks and Romans were enjoying 
the globe artichoke while the humble Jerusalem 
artichoke was still undreamed of. It is a kind of 
huge thistle, of which you can only eat the scaly 
immature flower-heads ; and of these, the only 
essential part is the fleshy base to which the unde- 
veloped petals are attached. Moreover, it is not 
to be found in many gardens ; people don't consider 
the game worth the candle, for though the artichoke 
is nominally a hardy perennial, in various districts 
it is nothing; of the sort. And it must be gathered 
and cooked at exactly the right moment, when 
neither too small to be flavourless or too large to be 
succulent. . . . The ^' chards " which succeed the 
flower heads also make good eating. 

PrepanUion. — Cut the stem level with the leaves, 
remove some of the tough bottom leaves ; the top 
leaves may also be trimmed into shape by cutting

away about an inch. Subsequently wash the 
artichokes, and proceed to cook them. Serve with 
beurre fondu in a separate dish. 

1. ARTICHOKES BOILED 

Prepare as stated above. Place the artichokes 
in boiling salted water. Let them continue to boil 
fast until the leaves will come away easily from the 
base — say about thirty minutes. Serve with melted 
butter or Sauce HoUandaise. 

2. ARTICHOKES STEWED 

Trim and prepare the artichokes, remove the 
*' chokes," rub some lemon juice round the cavity 
where the choke was, and parboil in salted water 
with a squeeze of lemon-juice. Drain thoroughly, 
and put into a stewpan in which one ounce of butter 
has been dissolved. Dust with salt and pepper, 
sprinkle with small bits of butter, and let stew slowly 
till quite done. Serve with a rich sauce. 



3. ARTICHOKES STUFFED 

Prepare some artichoke bottoms ; boil till tender, 
drain and wipe gently, dust with salt and pepper. 
Place them in a buttered baking-dish ; fill each with 
grated or finely chopped nuts. Strew over these 
some fine crumbs and a little melted butter. Bake 
in a hot oven for about ten minutes, carefully 
basting, and send to table in the same dish. 

ARTICHOKES (JERUSALEM) 

NoTB. — ^It is an insoluble mystery why these 
extremely easily-grown, cheap, and valuable tubers 
are comparatively little known. I have come across 
very many people who never use them at all ; who 
haidly, indeed, knew them by sight. They are like

16 MAY BYRON'S VEGETABLE BOOK 

smallish, irregularly shaped potatoes to look at, 
and in actual food-value they stand next to potatoes, 
parsnips being third. They are particularly diges* 
tible, and have a mild, pleasant flavour of their own ; 
their texture, too, is pleasing, and their cooking a 
simple matter, llie name Jerusalem is a corruption 
of the Italian giraad, meaning a sunflower or heli- 
anthus, to which fanxily the Jerusalem artichoke be- 
longs ; it is not really an artichoke at all. (I should 
imagine that the roots or tubers of all the helianthus 
tribe were edible— if anybody had the courage to 
experiment.) It originally came, about 1600, from 
North America, where it was appreciated and cul- 
tivated by the Red Indians — ^an appreciation very 
much to their credit. 

Pr&paraiion. — ^Much as for potatoes which are to 
be boiled without their skins. Carefully peel, 
scrape, and wash the artichokes, and blanch them 
in cold water. Some people place them in a sauce- 
pan of salted cold water, like old potatoes ; but in 
the majority of recipes which follow, boiling water 
is indicated. Be cautious that they do not get over- 
done, and become all soft and squashy. Twenty 
minutes' fast boiling should suffice, if they are put 
into boiling water. 

4. ARTICHOKES BAKED 

Peel, wash, and wipe dry one pound to two pounds 
of Jerusalem artichokes. Sprinkle salt over them, 
and let them stand half an hour ; then dry them 
again with a cloth, and put them, in a dripping-tin 
covered with dripping, in the oven till they are quite 
tender and well browned aU over. They should all 
be of an even size, or the larger ones can be halved. 
When they are done, drain them and place in a hot 
dish, or round a hot joint ; under which they can be 
baked if need be.

5. ARTICHOKES BOILED 

Wash and scrape the desired number of Jerusalem 
artichokes. Cover with boiling salted water and cook 
until tender (about half an hour) ; drain, dust with 
salt, and set on the back of the range to evaporate 
the moisture. Serve with melted butter, or with 
white or B^hamel sauce. 

6. ARTICHOKES WITH CHEESE 

Boil two pounds of Jerusalem artichokes, drain, 
and mash them up with one gill of milk. (Mashed 
cooked onions are an improvement, and yester- 
day's onion sauce is an admirable substitute for 
mUk.) Turn the mixture into a well-buttered 
baking-dish, dust the top well with grated cheese, 
and bake till the top becomes coloured. 

7. ARTICHOKES, ESPAGNOLE 

Peel, thoroughly wash and drain twelve Jerusalem 
artichokes ; heat two tablespoonf uls of leaf lard in a 
frying-pan, arrange the artichokes in it, and slowly 
fry for fifteen minutes, or until a nice brown colour, 
turning once in a while ; take up and place in a sauce- 
pan with one gill and a half of demi-glace (No. 704) 
and one tablespoonful of Madeira wine. Care- 
fully mix, season with half a teaspoonful of salt, a 
saltspoonful of cayenne ; cover the pan, then set in 
the oven for fifteen minutes. Remove, place in a 
deep dish, and serve. 

8. ARTICHOKES FRIED IN BATTER 

Peel and wash some Jerusalem artichokes, 
choosing good-sized ones, as evenly shaped as you 
can find. SUce them thinly, and, having made a 
batter with one beaten egg, one tablespoonful of 
flour, and half a pint of milk, dip them in it ; lift

them out separately with a skimmer or egg-slice, 
and fry them at once in boiling fat. They should be 
a golden brown. 



9. ARTICHOKES AU GRATIN 

Take three large Jerusalem artichokes, peel, wash, 
and boil them perfectly tender. Mash them with a 
fork, adding pepper and salt to taste, and a squeeze 
of lemon juice. Put them in a buttered pie-dish, 
alternately with layers of grated cheese ; finish the 
top with breadcrumbs and cheese, and smaU bits 
of butter. Put into a quick oven for ten minutes, 
and serve at once. 



10. ARTICHOKES. PERSILLADE, No. 1 

Peel, wash, and drain twenty-four fresh, sound, 
medium Jerusalem artichokes. Heat two table- 
spoonfuls of melted lard in a frying-pan, place them 
in the pan, and let them brown a nice colour all 
over. Sprinkle over a teaspoonful of salt and two 
salt-spoonfuls of white pepper, and set in oven for 
twenty-five minutes. Remove, take all fat from

spoonful of chopped parsley. Remove fat from 
pan, add one ounce of butter, thoroughly heat, 
then squeeze in juice of half a sound lemon ; lightly 
mix, pour it over the artichokes, and serve. 



ARTICHOKES— CHINESE (OR JAPANESE) 

Note. — ^The Chinese artichoke is not, strictly 
speaking, an artichoke at all, but a very pretty little 
tuber, singularly resembling a carved ivory chess- 
queen. It belongs to the same family (Stachys) 
as the garden Lamb's-Ear and the wild Betony. 
It is not so much grown as it deserves to be, 
combining, as it does, the triple attractions of 
appearance, taste, and digestibihty. To these we 
might add novelty — always desirable where food is 
concerned. It can be eaten either boiled or fried, 
or raw as a constituent of salads. 

Preparation. — ^little preparation is needed be- 
yond washing and a modicum of trimming. 

In order to retain their charming ivory tint, 
uncooked Chinese artichokes should be carefully 
guarded against exposure to light.

13. ARTICHOKES (CHINESE) BOILED 

Prei)are as stated above. Place in fast-boiling 
salted water ; boil until tender, but not broken, 
say about twenty minutes, and serve with melted 
butter, white sauce, or Sauce HoUandaise. 

14. ARTICHOKES (CHINESE) FRIED 

Wash and wipe dry, then fry the artichokes 
whole in butter. Let them obtain a nice brown, and 
serve on hot buttered toast. They can, at discretion, 
be dipped in egg and breadcrumbs before frying. 

15. ARTICHOKES (CHINESE) STEWED 

For a pound of the vegetables, put one pint of 
water into a stewpan with a saltspoonful of salt, a 
dessertspoonful of vinegar, a tectspoonful of flour, 
and an ounce of butter ; stir these all over the fire 
till boiling, then put in the artichokes, which should 
have been washed and scraped, and simmer slowly 
for fifteen minutes with the stewpan not quite 
covered down ; then drain and serve with butter, 
or any sauces suitable for celery. 



ASPARAGUS 

Note. — ^It is extremely odd that although Asi)ara- 
gus is one of the oldest vegetables known to horti- 
culture, and moreover is an indigenous British plant, 
we have never yet learnt to pronounce its name. 
To the English lower classes — ^notoriously poor 
linguists — it is " sparrowgrass," and nothing else. 
Asparagus is a sea-coast plant of the Lily tribe, and 
its scaly stalks, which we eat, are as succulent and 
agreeable as its foliage (if left to develop) is decora- 
tive and beautiful. It is dear to buy, but (once 
established) easy to grow, being a herbaceous

COOKED PLAINLY OR ELABORATELY 21 

perennial, not an annual like the commoner and 
cheaper vegetables. Its delicate flavour is unique ; 
its nourishing qualities, though not now esteemed 
so highly as in former centuries, are still considerable ; 
and its appearance has an elegance, a style, a je ne 
aaia quai, which one can scarcely parallel. It affords 
to the consumer a sense of opulence and luxury 
which is extremely attractive in these penurious 
times, and it is tempting alike to the invalid or 
the epicure, though many medical men forbid it to 
the gouty patient. 

Preparaiion. — ^Wash the asparagus, which should 
be freshly gathered ; remove with a sharp knife any 
coarse scales towards the lower end ; tie it up with 
tape into bundles of twelve to twenty-four stems 
each (which should so far as possible be all the same 
thickness), keeping the heads symmetrically level 
with each other ; and cut the stem-bases level, so 
that every stick is of the same length. 

16. ASPARAGUS BAKED WITH CHEESE 

One bunch of asparagus, three tablespoonfuls of 
butter, three tablespoonfuls of flour, a quarter of a 
teaspoonful of salt, one cup of white stock or one 
cup of asparagus stock, haU a cup of cream, yolks 
of two eggs, ^ated Parmesan cheese, buttered 
biscuit or bread-crumbs. 

Scrape the scales from the stalks, and wash and tie 
the asparagus in a bunch. Cook in boiling salted 
water until nearly tender, and drain carefully. Make 
a sauce of the butter, flour, seasoning stock and 
cream ; add the yolks and two tablespoonfuls of 
cheese. Stir the sauce until the cheese melts, but 
do not let it boil. Put the asparagus and sauce into 
a buttered, oval baking-dish in layers, leaving the 
asparagus tips at one end of the dish and covering 
only two-thirds the length of the stalks with sauce. 



Digitized by VnOOQ IC 



22 MAY BYRON'S VEGETABLE BOOK 

Sprinkle each layer of sauce with cheese, having th« 
last layer sauce. Cover with buttered crumbs, and 
set the dish in the oven long enough to brown the 
crumbs. The tender portions of the asparagus, cut 
in half-inch lengths before cooking, may be used 
instead of the whole stalks. 

17. ASPARAGUS BOILED, No. 1 

Undoubtedly asparagus is best boiled in the 
following way, which leaves the tips above water. 
Have a saucepan of salted boiling water (to which 
one tablespoonful of vinegar may be added at 
pleasure) sufficient to cover two-thirds of the 
aBi)aragus stalks, stood on end in bundles. The 
stems, which are thicker and tougher, will be thus 
cooked in boiling water, while the delicate tips are 
steamed. Do not cover the saucepan. The aspara- 
gus will take from half an hour to forty minutes to 
cook. Drain it, take off the tape, and either lay it 
on dry toast in a dish, or upon a napkin, and serve 
with Sauce Hollandaise or with beurre fondu. 

18. ASPARAGUS BOILED. No. 2 

It is better to cut and cook asparagus as you 
require it ; but if it be bought, put the stems into 
cold water till you are ready to cook it. The white 
ends of the stems must be scraped and washed in 
cold water ; then the asparagus should be tied into 
small bundles, and placed in boiling salted water 
in a saucepan without a lid. Cook until tender, 
which should be in about fifteen minutes ; drain 
and serve on buttered toast. 

19. ASPARAGUS BOILED, MOUSSELmB SAUCE 

Prepare and cook as usual. When tender, drain, 
and serve on a slice of toast, pouring the sauce over 
the asparagus. Surround with fanciful-shaped bits

of bread, 8aut6 in butter. For the sauce, beat 
two tablespoonfuls of butter to a cream, add the 
yolks of four eggs, one at a time ; then add two 
tablespoonfuls of lemon juice, a quarter of a tea- 
spoonful of salt, and a dash of cayenne. Cook 
over hot water until the sauce thickens, then 
add two tablespoonfuls of butter in three parts, 
incorporating each part before another is added. 
Lastly beat in a quarter of a cup of thick cream. 
Serve when thoroughly heated. The sauce should 
be thick and frothy. 

20. ASPARAGUS EN BRANCHES 

Scrape the coarse scales from the branches, cut in 
equal lengths, and tie in bunches. Cook the aspara- 
gus in a small quantity of water, drain, and dispose 
on a well-toasted and buttered slice of bread. Rub 
the yolks of three hard-boiled eggs to a smooth 
paste, add a quarter of a teaspoonful of salt and a 
dash of pepper ; then gradually beat into the egg 
enough butter, softened but not melted, to make a 
sauce of the consistency of mayonnaise dressing. 
Mask the asparagus with the sauce and serve at 
once. B^hamel, white, HoUandaise, and B^arnaise 
sauce (hot or cold) are all used with asparagus. 

21. ASPARAGUS CREAMED 

Take about two dozen good pieces of asparagus, 
and break the stalks into pieces one inch long, or 
cut with a silver knife. Cook them in boiling water, 
slightly salted ; do not put in the tips till the stalks 
are half-done. Have ready some cream sauce, 
made as follows : one pint of cream (or hot milk for 
economy), two tablespoonfuls of flour, the same of 
butter; salt and pepper to taste. Drain and 
serve the asi)aragus on buttered toast, masked with 
the cream sauce.

22. ASPARAGtJS AUX CBUFS 

Take about a dozen stalks of cold cooked asparagus 
and cut them into very small pieces, no larger than 
peas. Place in a lined saucepan one ounce of butter ; 
let it melt, then add one tablespoonful of new milk or 
cream, one table6;)oonful of good stock or gravy, 
salt and pepper to taste, and three eggs well whisked. 
Mix thoroughly, put in the asparagus, let the mixture 
simmer quickly till the eggs set and thicken ; then 
pour it upon slices of buttered toast. 

23. ASPARAGUS OMELET 

Whisk six eggs to a froth (whites and yolks to- 
gether), and add two tablespoonfuls of milk ; have 
ready some asparagus tips, boiled and allowed to 
get cold, then finely chopped (one bunch of asparagus 
shotdd suffice). Melt one tablespoonful of butter in 
a frying-pan ; add the asparagus to the egg, etc., 
pour in the butter, and treat as an ordinary omelet, 
folding it over and serving very hot. 

24, ASPARAGUS PATTIES 

Make a sauce of three level tablespoonfuls each 
of butter and flour, and half a cup each of chicken 
broth, cream, and the water in which a bunch of 
asparagus has been boiled; add the beaten yolks 
of two eggs, a teaspoonful of lemon juice, salt and 
pepper, and a bunch of hot asparagus, cut in small 
pieces and cooked until tender. Serve in hot puff- 
paste shells, in cases made of fritter batter, or in 
bread croustades.

twenty-five minutes. Lift up, drain on a sieve, and 
dress on a dish. Place one ounce of butter in a 
frying-pan with three tablespoonfuls of breadcrumbs, 
toss on fire until a light brown, pour butter over 
asparagus, and serve. 

26. ASPARAGUS PUDDING 

Boil two bunches of asparagus till tender; let 
them cool, and cut off the green tops. These must 
be chopped quite small (with a silver knife for 
choice), and added to the following mixture : four 
eggs well whisked, one tablespoonful of butter 
(melted), three tablespoonfuls of flour, one breakfast- 
cupful of milk in which one saltspoonful of bi- 
carbonate of soda has been dissolved, seasoning to 
taste of pepper and salt. The eggs, butter, and 
seasoning should be whisked together, and the flour 
gradually added — ^lastly the milk and the asparagus. 
Pour into a buttered mould, cover securely, and 
place in boiling water for two hours, or steam for 
two and a half hours. Serve in a hot dish. 



27. ASPARAGUS, SPANISH STYLE 

Cook the asparagus tied in a bunch, the tips out 
of the water, or cut the tender portion in small 
pieces ; put all but the tips over the fire to cook, and 
when partly cooked add the tips. Drain the 
asparagus and turn into a serving-dish ; add two 
tablespoonfuls of vinegar or lemon juice to the 
water, and in it poach three or four eggs ; place the 
eggs in the asparagus and pour over the whole 
French dressing, to which a teaspoonful each of 
fine-chopped parsley capers and cucumber pickles 
have been added.

boiling water with a tablespoonful of salt, and boil 
for fifteen minutes. Remove and drain well. 

Mix on a plate one ounce of grated Swiss and one 
ounce of grated Parmesan cheese. Lightly butter a 
baking-dish, arrange a third of the asparagus as a 
layer at the bottom of the dish, sprinkle a third of 
the cheese over, then another third of the asparagus, 
a third of the cheese, then the rest of the asparagus 
and cheese on top. Place an ounce of butter in a 
frjring-pan with half a very finely chopped white 
onion ; toss until a very light brown, and pour over 
the asparagus. Set in the oven for fifteen minutes. 
Remove and serve. 

29. ASPARAGUS TIPS 

Cut off the tender parts of a large bunch of fresh, 
green, sound asparagus ; wash in cold water, drain, 
and place in a saucepan with a quart of water, a tea- 
spoonful of salt, a teaspoonful of sugar, and boil for 
twenty minutes. Remove and thoroughly drain on 
a sieve. Heat half an ounce of butter in a frying- 
pan; add the tips. Season with a saltspoonful of 
salt, two saltspoonfuls of sugar, and two saltspoon- 
fuls of pepper. Toss gently, and cook for five 
minutes, tossing them once in a while. Dress on a 
vegetable dish and serve. 

If no fresh asparagus is at hand, use tinned 
asparagus, but boil for five minutes instead of 
twenty and prepare the same way.

then add the tips with half an ounce of good butter ; 
mix well, let boil for five minutes, pour in a vegetable 
dish, and serve. 



BEANS 

Note. — ^All sorts of curious superstitions hang 
around the harmless, necessary bean. It has been 
cultivated for countless centuries, but often as an 
object of fear and reverence, rather than for its 
unquestionable food-value. By certain Greek philo- 
sophers, beans were associated with the transmigra- 
tion of souls, and hence became forbidden food. By 
the ancient Egyptians, beans were regarded as sinister 
and evil things. By our own "rude forefathers," 
the scent of bean-flowers was considered ominous 
and unlucky. Beans figure largely in folk-lore and 
fairy-tales : magic beans of incredible growth, sic 
Uur ad astra ; sacks of beans which are exchanged 
for mysterious gifts ; and so forth. Whilst, even 
now, the phrase " to give a man beans " contains an 
occult significance beneath its superficial simplicity. 

The most remarkable bean of all, the soya bean, 
has only been known to Europe about seven years, 
though soya flour has been used for over two thou- 
iand years in the Far East, and is higher than 
wheat in protein value. To the soya bean, and the 
oil extracted from it, some three or four years ago, 
was ascribed the following list of products. I don't

two inches long ! No '' Jack and the Beanstalk " 
romance can beat this. But to come back to our 
own common-or-garden beans (perhaps we have not 
explored as yet a tenth of their potential value). 

The broad or Windsor bean, that admirable 
legume which is, usually, only to be encountered 
on the humble domestic board — ^hardly ever upon 
the table of plutocracy — ^is indeed a delectable dish. 
Discreetly clad in parsley sauce, and commonly 
companioned with boiled bacon, it is the ideal fare 
of the hungry schoolboy. It has been used a long, 
long while in Britain, whereas the kidney or 
haricot bean — ^the dwarf French bean — only arrived 
to us in the early sixteenth century, and the brave 
and beneficent scarlet runner was unknown here till 
circa 1600.

COOKED PLAINLY OR ELABORATELY 29 

All beans are incomparably useful if properly 
cooked. They don't agree with everybody, worse 
luck. The present writer suffers tortures if she rashly 
ventures upon a helping of broad beans, butter 
beans, or haricots. By the way, we have not men- 
tioned butter (or Lima) beans. They are enormously 
employed in the United States of America, either 
fresh or tinned, usually plus pork. " They are," as 
Artemus Ward observed, "a cheerful fruit when 
used tempritly." As they won't grow satisfactorily 
over here, they can only be had in their dried 
form, like dried haricots. They make a welcome 
variety in winter. Haricots are especially nutritious, 
economical, and wholesome. 

Preparation. — (1) Broad (Windsor) beans should 
be gathered and eaten young, or not at all. As a 
rule, they are never procurable in shops until really 
too old for any person of taste. By the time the 
skins are so thick that the beans have to be peeled 
after cooking they are not fit for human food. 
They should be put into fast-boiling water, slightly 
salted (one saltspoonful to one quart), just sufficient 
to cover them, and boiled until the skins crack — i.e. 
about twenty-five minutes. Drain and serve them 
with Sauce Hollandaise, beurre fondu, or parsley 
sauce, in a separate dish. 

(2) French beans should also be used while quite 
young, before they become stringy, boiled whole in 
a minimum of salted water, and served with separate 
sauce as above. Older ones may be sliced and 
boiled in water or stock. The same remarks apply 
to Scarlet Runhers. 

(3) Haricot beans (dried) should be washed and 
soaked in cold water overnight, then boiled for at 
least three hours. Salt should be added when they 
are half done. Two quarts of boiling water should 
be allowed for each pint of haricots.

31. BROAD BEANS CREAMED 

Take about two pounds of shelled broad beans, 
cook them in boiling salted water till nearly done; 
then drain them, and put them to stew slowly in 
a pan, along with half a pint of good stock, one 
teaspoonful of finely minced parsley, and one tea- 
spoonful (or one lump) of sugar. When the beans 
are thoroughly tender, and the liquid has mostly 
boiled away, whisk one yolk of egg along with half 
a tumblerful of milk or cream. 

32. BROAD BEANS MASHED 

Broad beans which are becoming old should be 
boiled until the outer skin is loose and can be easily 
removed. Mash the inside, and add it to the fol- 
lowing mixture, prepared in a saucepan : one ounce 
of butter, melted, and two teaspoonfuls chopped 
parsley, with seasoning of pepper and salt ; mix all 
thoroughly, and add one teaspoonful of grated 
cheese and one teaspoonful of milk. Serve on 
slices of fried bread. 

33. BROAD WINDSOR BEAN PUDDING 

Broad beans may be made into a pudding by 
pounding them in a mortar after boiling them and 
taking off the skins, then seasoning with salt and 
pepper, and a little butter, and tying them up in 
a cloth that has been floured and buttered. The 
pudding must be put into boiling water, and boiled 
for half an hour. When done, squeeze the water 
out by pressing the cloth, and take out the pudding, 
to which you can give any shape you please. Yolks 
of eggs beaten up, and the crumb of a roll soaked in 
cream, may be pounded with the beans to make 
a richer sort of pudding. This may be either 
boiled in a basin or baked in an oven.

pepper, adding two medium white onions cut in 
halves, three small branches of parsley tied with 
a sprig of bay leaf ; add half a pound piece of 
salt pork, cover the pan, set on the fire, and let cook 
slowly for two hours. 

Heat in a saucepan two tablespoonf uls of melted 
butter, add one medium, chopped onion and three 
tablespoonf uls of flour ; cook for five minutes, con- 
tinually stirring meanwhile; then strain all the 
gravy of the beans into this pan. Mix well and boil 
for two minutes. Remove all the ingredients from 
the beans, then add the cooked beans to the sauce ; 
add a tablespoonful of chopped parsley, gently mix 
with a wooden spoon, and serve. 

48. HARICOT BEANS FRIQOLES (MEXICAN) 

Boil some haricot beans until quite soft ; drain

stuffing ; mix the beans with these ingredients in 
a basin with a little pork dripping ; cover the 
basin over, and warm up in the oven for half an 
hour. 

49. HARICOT BEAN FRITTERS 

Take some cold boiled haricot beans, and mash 
them up, seasoning them according to quantity with

finely minced parsley and shallots, and a little salt 
and pepper. Moisten with milk, and work in suffi- 
oient £uie breadcrumbs to make the mixture fairly 
solid. Form it into small round or oval cakes about 
one inch thick, which must be dipped in egg and 
breadcrumbs (or flour) and fried a pale brown. 
Butter beans may be treated as above, adding half 
an ounce of butter to half a pint of beans, one 
beaten egg, and a grate of nutmeg. 

60. HARICXyr BEANS WITH ONIONS 

Take one pound of haricot beans, and soak them 
twenty-four hours in cold water. Put them into 
two quarts of cold water in a saucepan, and let them 
simmer quickly for two hours ; then drain them, 
and put them into a frying-pan with two ounces of 
melted dripping, two onions cut in rings, half a tea- 
spoonful of salt. Fry the haricots lightly, shaking 
them well. A sharp sauce is a good accompaniment 
to beans of this kind. 

51. HARICOT BEANS STEWED 

Take half a pint of haricot beans, place them in a 
large saucepan with a very little cold water, not 
enough to cover them — ^the more water you put, 
the less they will be properly cooked. Put the pan 
over a very gentle heat, and let the beans stew gradu- 
ally for three hours ; if they become too dry, add 
occasionally a little more water. When they are 
quite soft, strain them off ; meanwhile prepare the 
following sauce. Heat a tablespoonful of dripping 
to boiling point in a frying-pan ; then stir in one 
teaspoonful of flour, and pepper and salt to taste. 
When the mixture has browned a little, add gradu- 
ally one tablespoonful of browning and about four 
tablespoonfuls or rather more of hot water. Let 
the sauce thicken, then pour it over the beans.

BUTTER BEANS OR LIMA BEANS 

Note. — ^These are extensively used in the 
U.S.A.y but we only get them in a dried form. One 
of our greatest seedsman firms has informed me that 
after long and repeated experiments, they have 
almost abandoned the attempt to grow them 
satisfactorily in this climate. Where you can grow 
them, they are called wax-pods while young, and 
are cooked and eaten whole. The following recipes 
are chiefly for freak beans, where procurable. 
Ordinary bought butter beans must be soaked over- 
night, like haricots, and skinned before cooking ; 
this is no doubt a bother, but their nutritive value 
is very great. 

62. BUTTER BEANS BONNE FEMME 

Place in an enamelled pan one finely chopped 
onion, two ounces of lean raw ham cut in small 
squares, one tablespoonful of melted butter, and 
nicely fry five minutes, stirring meanwhile ; add one 
pint of shelled Lima beans and half a pint of broth. 
Tie together a very small head of lettuce and two 
branches of parsley, and add to the beans. Season 
with half a teaspoonful of salt, three saltspoonfuls 
of pepper, half a saltspoonful of grated nutmeg, 
and lightly mix. Cover pan and let gently boil 
thirty-five minutes, then lift up the lettuce, etc. 
Knead on a saucer one ounce of butter with a light 
tablespoonful of flour and add to the beans ; gently 
mix without mashing and cook for two minutes 
more. Pour them into a vegetable dish and serve. 

63. BUTTER BEAN CROQUETTES 

Half a pint of dried butter beans, half an ounce 
of butter, one teaspoonful of chopped parsley, half

pepper, one-eighth of a teaspoon! ul of grated nut- 
meg, one egg, oil for frying. Soak the beans in 
cold water overnight ; in the morning the skins 
can be removed easily. Put them into a saucepan, 
with plenty of boiling water and a teaspoonful of 
salt, and boil gently for an hour, or longer, until 
quite tender. 

64. BUTTER BEANS, FERMIERE 

Finely slice two very smcdl, scraped carrots, one 
small white onion, and one ounce of lean salt pork

then add a pint of shelled lima beans. Tie together 
two leaves of lettuce, one clove of garlic, one branch of 
par8ley,and a branch of chervil, and add to the beans ; 
pour hot water up to half the height of the beans. 
Season with half a teaspoonful of salt, half a teaspoon- 
ful of sugar, and two saltspoonsful of pepper. Mix 
well, cover the pan, cook on the range for five 
minutes, then set in oven for thirty-five minutes. 
Remove, lift up the bouquet, add half an ounce of 
butter, and toss well. Place on a vegetable dish, and 
serve. 

56. BUTTER BEANS AUX FINES HERBES 

Boil a pint of shelled Lima beans in a quart of 
boiling water, with a teaspoonful of salt, twenty-five

teaspoonful of salt and two saltspoonfuls of pepper. 
Finely chop together two branches of parsley, one 
branch of chervil, ten branches of chives, and six 
tarragon leaves ; add this mixture to the beans, toss 
well in pan, and cook five minutes, frequently tossing 
meanwhile. Transfer beans into a vegetable dish, 
and serve.

BEETROOT 

Note. — ^This, though you might never think so, is 
a first cousin of Spinach. It grows wild in Britain, 
as does Good King Henry, another cousin ; and 
has been used with us as an eatable for at least seven 
hundred years. Most people regard beetroot only as 
an ingredient of salads, or to be sliced in vinegar. 
But, baked or boiled and eaten hot like other root 
vegetables, it is at once more digestible and, to my 
thinking, more attractive. Owing to the natural 
sugar of beetroot, it is inadvisable for any person 
suffering from gout, rheumatism, or diabetes. 

Preparation.— Great care must be taken not to 
break the skin of beet before cooking it. Wipe it 
gently to remove any soil which may adhere, but 
don't attempt to trim- or cut it. Put it into fast- 
boiling water, and let boil from one to two hours, 
according to the size and age of the roots. Then 
remove, drain, and skin them ; some people plunge 
them in cold water to make the skin come off more 
easily, but if they are to be served hot, this is an 
obvious mistake. Place them in a hot dish, and 
season them with pepper and salt ; add butter or 
gravy, or pour a thick white sauce over them. 

66. BEETROOT BAKED, No. 1 

Put the beetroot without washing it into a slack 
oven, and bake for eight hours. When cold, peel 
it, and serve as above. 

67. BEETROOT BAKED. No. 2 

Boil and peel a good-sized beetroot, cut it into 
thick slices, lay a little piece of butter on each, put 
them in a dripping-pan, and stew in a sharp oven for 
half an hour, basting with butter and lemon juice 
every five minutes or so. Serve very hot.

68. BEETROOT BOILED 

Boil rapidly until tender. New beets will cook in 
one or two hours ; old beets can hardly be cooked 
enough. When tender, drain and cover with cold 
water to loosen the skins. The skins should be 
removed with the hands. Season with salt, pepper, 
and butter. If the beets be large, cut into slices. 
Beets left over may be covered with vinegar and kept 
for several days. Beets baked in a hot oven are 
particularly good. When cooked, cut these in slices, 
dress with butter, pepper, and salt. 

69. BEETROOT BOILED (CX)LD) 

Do not wash the beetroot, for fear of breaking 
the skin, which would make it a bad colour. Place 
it in a large saucepan, completely covered with 
fast-boiling water, and keep the water boiling for 
two hours, or longer if the beetroot is very large. 
When quite cold, skin it thoroughly, cut up in 
slices, and lay them in vinegar, adding salt and 
pepper. At table the addition of a little olive oil 
is an improvement. 

60. BEETROOT CREAMED 

Take two smallish boiled beetroots, cut them into 
neat rounds, and place them in a pan with a sauce 
made thus : one ounce of butter, one beaten yolk, 
one teaspoonful of milk, half a teaspoonful of lemon 
juice, pepper and salt tqjba^ste. Let the mixture stew 
quietly for ten minutes, and get well warmed through, 
but never come near boiling. Serve at once in hot 
dish.

but not mashed at all — about one hour. Serve 
very hot. 

M. BEETROOT STEWED, No. 2 

Take two medium-sized cooked beetroots ; peel

Serve it in a heated vegetable-dish, and sprinkle over

CABBAGES 

Note. — Cabbage, Kail, Colewort, or by whatever 
name it goes, is a vegetable of great antiquity in 
Europe. Its name is derived from the Latin CavUa 
capitattis, caviis, a stem, and captU^ a head ; and 
hence Cauliflower and all the other English names. 
Cabbages and all their tribe — Borecole, Broccoli, 
Brussels Sprouts, Kohl-rabi, Savoys, etc., etc. — are so 
popular, and so useful, that one can hardly conceive 
of anything to supply their place. The cabbage 
itself is a wild native British plant ; the others have 
been artificially developed by long culture, and 
were gradually introduced into England during the 
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. It seems almost 
comic to think of the cauliflower as a rare and 
precious luxury, but such it undoubtedly was at 
first. What is sold, however, by costermongers at 
2d. each for huge heads, is the hardier and cheaper 
broccoli, which is available from November to June. 

Preparation. — (1) Cabbages, savoys. Remove the 
solid outside leaves, trim stalk, and cut into two or 
four sections ; place in cold, salted water, and explore 
for slugs and other unwelcome guests. Place in 
f ast-bofling salted water, with the lid off ; skim from 
time to time, and let boil till tender — fifteen to 
twenty-five minutes. If a little underdone, or a 
little overdone, cabbages are spoilt. Remember 
to use as little water as possible, and don't throw it 
away, but keep it for vegetable stock. Remember 
also that steaming, though a longer process, is a far 
better one than boiling. (2) Broccoli and cauli- 
flowers should be prepared in the same way, but 



Digitized by VnOOQ IC 



COOKED PLAINLY OR ELABORATELY 43 

instead of cutting them verticaUy, cut a deep oroes 
on the base of the stomp. (3) Brussels sprouts 
should take about fifteen minutes. Drain any of 
these vegetables very thoroughly before serving. 

67. CABBAGE BAKED 

Wash, trim, and boil a large cabbage. When 
quite tender, drain it thoroughly ; let it be rubbed 
through a sieve and dusted with grated nutmeg. 
Put it into the hot dish on which it will be served, 
sprinkle it with small pieces of butter, and place it in 
the oven till quite heated through. 

68. CABBAGE BOILED 

Remove the outside leaves, and cut it in quarters ; 
pick it weU and wash it clean ; boil it in water, with 
plenty of salt in it ; when it is tender, and a fine 
light green, lay it on a sieve to drain, but do not 
squeeze it; if you do, it wiU take off the flavour. 
Qftve ready some very rich melted butter, or chop 
it with cold butter. Greens must be boiled in the 
same way. 

69. CABBAGE WITH CREAM 

Take a good cabbage, wash and trim it, place it 
in fast-boiling salted water, along with an onion 
stuck with one clove. When the cabbage is cooked 
quite tender, drain it (having removed the onion, 
etc.), and pulp it through a sieve. Melt one table- 
spoonful of butter in a stewpan, and stir in the 
cabbage ; season with salt and pepper, and moisten 
with cream. When all is thoroughly heated, dish 
it on buttered toast or fried bread, very hot. 

70. CABBAGE FRIED

butter over it, sprinkle some grated cheese over the 
melted butter, place it in the oven for five minutes, 
and then serve very hot. 

71. CABBAGE PIEDMONT 

Boil or steam one pound of cabbage. Drain, 
press, and let it get cold. Cook, separately from 
this, eight ounces of mild onions ; let them get

parsley. Shred in the cabbage and onions in 
alternate layers of esyoh, with a seasoning of salt 
and pepper to eaxih layer, a few little bits of butter 
here and there, and a thin layer of grated cheese. 
When the dish is nearly full, moisten the mixture 
with stock or milk (taking care not to make it too 
wet) till it is level with the top of dish. Brush the 
top with a little melted butter, cook in moderate 
oven for about half an hour, and serve when it is 
thoroughly hot. 

72. CABBAGE (RED) BOILED

86. COUVE TRONCHUDA, OR PORTUGAL 
CABBAGE 

NoU. — Otherwise known as seakale cabbage, this is 
a useful vegetable, which exactly corresponds to its 
name ; for it is a cabbage whose large fleshy mid-ribs 
are removed, and cooked d la seakale ; while the 
heart and outer leaves may be made into a separate 
dish, d la cabbage. These latter should be used 
first, while absolutely fresh.

globular plant, are not used ; but the part itself 
can be cooked like turnips, according to any recipe 
suitable for them ; or it can be boiled in a very Mttle 
salted water till quite tender, and served with white 
sauce, when it will be found excellent. 

Preparation. — See Turnip.

BRUSSELS SPROUTS 

Note. — These admirable little vegetables are 
without doubt the best of aU the cabbage kind. 
They represent quality versus quantity, and as a 
winter vegetable are unsurpassed both in flavour 
and appearance. They are so dainty and so delicious 
that it is worth while presenting them upon the table 
with extra care. They should never be served wet 
or squashy, but individually perfect. The smaller 
they are, the better ; and they should be chosen 
80 far as possible all of one size. 

Preparation. — ^Trim away any jutting stalks or 
discoloured outer leaves, and be most particular 
about washing, as slugs and insects can easily hide 
in these compact little sprouts. 

88. BRUSSELS SPROUTS BOILED, No. 1 

Prepare as above, place in fast-boiling salted 
water (or, better still, in a steamer above it), and let

When they are tender without being broken — say in 
ten to fifteen minutes — drain very thoroughly and 
carefully, and serve.

in boOing water for five minutes, drain and peel. 
Place in a saucepan with enough white broth to just 
cover, season with three saltspoonfuls each of salt 
and sugar, cover pan, and let cook for twenty-five 
minutes. Drain, then place both chestnuts and 
sprouts in a frying-pan with an ounce of butter, half

a teaspoonful of salt, and three saltspoonfuls of 
white pepper ; toss well, cook for five minutes, dress 
on a hot vegetable dish, and serve. 

93. BRUSSELS SPROUTS AU GRATIN 

Take small sprouts, as equal in size as may be ; 
clean and boil them, drain, and pile on a dish. Make 
a good white sauce, and add a little salt and pepper, 
a little cream, and grated cheese. Pour this all 
over the sprouts, dust a few fine rasped bread- 
crumbs over the top, and put into a moderate oven 
for four or five minutes. 

94. LYONS BRUSSELS SPROUTS 

Cook and well drain one pound of Brussels sprouts. 
Fry one tablespoonf ul of minced Spanish onions in 
one ounce of butter ; when this is a golden colour, 
add in the sprouts ; toss them in the pan for three 
minutes, and serve very hot. 

95. BRUSSELS SPROUTS STUFFED 

Wash some fine large sprouts and remove the 
centres. Take one pound of well-seasoned pork 
sausages, skin them, and cut them up in pieces 
about an inch long. Put a piece of sausage into 
each hollow sprout, bind it carefully, and put the 
sprouts into fast-boiling stock till tender. Remove 
and drain, and serve at once, thickening the stock 
as a sauce to serve separately. 

CAULIFLOWER AND BROCCOLI 

Note. — ^The difference between broccoli and 
cauliflower is chiefly apparent to the highly cultured 
palate, and to the working gardener. Most people 
only know these two vegetables apart by the fact 
that they get cauliflowers from March to November, 
broccolis from September till June ; i.e. cauliflower

COOKED PLAINLY OR ELABORATELY 63 

chiefly in summer and broccoli chiefly in winter. 
The cooking of them is identical ; but cauliflower 
is really the more delicately flavoured of the two. 
They are very useful and wholesome vegetables. 

Preparatiofhe. — See note to "Cabbage." Place 
them upside down in the pan, and be careful to 
achieve the exact amount of boiling ; a cauliflower 
whicli tumbles to pieces is only little less objection- 
able than one which is hard and underdone. 

96. CAULIFLOWER BOILED 

Trim off the outside leaves, and cut the stalk even 
with the edible portion, to stand level. Let stand 
head downward in cold salted water half an hour 
to draw out insects that may be present. Steam 
or cook head downward and uncovered, in a large 
kettle of rapid-boiling, salted water, until tender 
(about twenty minutes). Remove any scum that 
is present on the top of the water before lifting the 
cauliflower from the vessel. The cauliflower may 
be tied in a cheese cloth before cooking. Serve with 
cream, white, B^hamel, HoUandaise, or tomato 
sauce. Cooked flowerets of cauliflower are used to 
garnish dishes of veal, chicken, and sweetbread. 

97. CAULIFLOWER WITH CHEESE, No. 1 

Trim and wash a good-sized cauliflower ; make 
sure that it will stand quite evenly. Boil it till 
tender ; then carefully remove and drain it, and 
stand it upright in a round dish or tureen. Pour 
over it about a pint, or rather less, of boiling white 
sauce, into which eight ounces of cheese has been 
grated. Serve at once. 

98. CAULIFLOWER WITH CHEESE, No. 2 

Boil a medium-sized cauliflower till tend^, but 
not breaking. Have ready a sauce prepared as

follows : one breakfastcupful and a half of new 
milky three tablespoonfuls of flour, three table- 
spoonfuls of butter, half a teaspoonful of salt and 
the same of pepper, half a breakfastcupful of grated 
cheese. Divide the cauliflower into flowerets, and 
arrange them neatly in a buttered pie-dish. Pour 
the sauce over the cauliflower, strew it thickly with 
fine breadcrumbs, sprinkle a little melted butter 
over, and place it in a hot oven till the crumbs are 
brown. 

99. CAULIFLOWER CURRIED 

Cook a good cauliflower till tender, but not broken. 
Drain, and remove the flower, placing it on a hot 
dish. Fry half an apple and a small onion, minced 
small, in two tablespoonfuls of butter ; when they 
are brown, stir in one teaspoonful of curry-powder 
and two teaspoonfuls of flour. Let these fry a few 
minutes, then stir in half a pint of good stock or 
gravy. Let this boil, then simmer it gently for 
several minutes ; add salt and pepper, and strain 
the sauce over the cauliflower. 

100. CAULIFLOWER A L'ESPAGNOL 

Parboil a large cauliflower, drain it, cut in pieces, 
and fry in dripping with a clove of garlic or an

water ; drain off the egg, and roll a second time in 
breadcrumbs, or dip in butter. When ready to 
serve, fry to a golden brown in deep fat, and drain 
on soft paper. Serve piled on a folded napkin, with 
sprigs of parsley between the flowerets, or serve as 
an entrfe with Sauce Tartare or tomato sauce. 

102. CAULIFLOWER FRIED WITH CHEESE 

Cut off stalky and remove outer branches from a 
firm, white caiidiflower. Drop it in three quarts of 
boiling water, with a tablespoonful of salt, and boil 
thirty-five minutes. Drain, then divide cauliflower 
in smaU bouquets. Season with half a teaspoonful 
of salt and two saltspoonfuls of pepper ; lightly roll 
in flour, dip in beaten egg, and then lightly roll in 
grated Parmesan cheese ; place in a frying basket, 
and fry in boiling fat eight minutes, or until a nice 
golden colour. Drain on a cloth, and serve. 

103. CAULIFLOWER FRITTERS 

Take a good, firm cauliflower, blanch it, and divide 
it into smaU pieces ; then dip each piece into thick 
white sauce, and put it in a cold place. When the 
pieces are quite firm and cold, make a batter as 
follows : one ounce of melted butter worked into 
eight ounces of flour, salted slightly ; moisten with 
a little warm water, and lastly beat in one white 
of egg whisked stiff. Cover each piece of cauliflower 
with this batter, drop it into a pan of boiling lard, 
fry a light gold colour, remove, drain, and serve at 
once.

of salt ; boil for forty minutes, drain, and separate 
the branches from the main stalk. Heat a table- 
spoonful of butter in a frying-pan ; add the cauli- 
flower, season with half a teaspoonful each of salt 
and pepper, then gently fry for ten minutes, 
frequently turning the pieces meanwhile, being 
careful not to break them, and arrange on a baking- 
dish. Mix in a saucepan, one tablespoonful of butter 
with one tablespoonful and half of flour ; heat for 
half a minute ; add one gill and half of hot milk, 
two saltspoonf uls of salt, half a saltspoonful each of 
cayenne pepper and grated nutmeg, a tablespoonful

Cut off the stalk and outer branches of a fresh, 
good-sized, white cauliflower. Neatly trim all round. 
Have half a gallon of water with a gill of milk and a 
tablespoonf ul of salt in a large saucepan, and when 
boiling add the cauliflower. Cover the pan and 
boil for forty minutes, briskly. Remove, drain, 
dress on a dish with a folded napkin, and serve with 
Hollandaise sauce separately. 

108. CAULIFLOWER A LA HUNTINGTON 

Steam the cauliflower prepared as above in a 
tightly closed kettle until tender ; separate into 
flowerets, and pour over these the following sauce : 
mix one teaspoonful and a half of mustard, one 
teaspoonful and a quarter of salt, one teaspoonful 
of powdered sugar, and quarter of a teaspoonful of 
cayenne or paprika ; add the slightly beaten yolks 
of four eggs and a quarter of a cup of olive oil. 
When thoroughly mixed, add half a cup of weak 
vinegar, in which half a teaspoonful of finely chopped 
shallot has infused for five minutes. Cook over hot 
pot until slightly thickened ; remove from the fire ;

mushroom caps, and saut6 them five minutes in three 
tablespoonf uls of butter ; add three tablespoonfuls 
of flour, and, when blended with the butter, add 
gradually one cup and a half of white stock ; stir 
until the boiling-point is reached. After all the broth 
has been added, let simmer ten minutes ; then 
remove from the fire, and stir in the yolks of three 
eggs, beaten and diluted with the juice of a lemon ; 
season with salt and pepper, and, if the heat of the 
sauce does not suffice to cook the egg, return to the 
fire over hot water for five minutes, stirring con- 
stantly meanwhile. Pour this over the flowerets 
of caiiliflower on the toast, sprinkle with buttered 
crumbs, and brown quickly in a very hot oven. 



110. CAULIFLOWER POLONAISE 

Trim off the outer leaves and stalk of a good-sized, 
white cauliflower. Place in a saucepan with two 
quarts of boiling water and a gill of hot milk; 
season with a tablespoonful of salt. C!over the pan 
and boil for forty minutes. Remove, drain on a 
sieve, and dress on a hot dish. Heat one table-

112. CAULIFLOWER SAXTTl^S 

Remove the outer leaves of a good-sized, firm, 
white cauliflower. Drop into a saucepan containing 
half a gallon of boiling water with a tablespoonful 
of salt, and boil for thirty-five minutes. Remove ; 
drain on a sieve ; then carefully detach all the 
branches with the flowers from the main stalk. 

Heat in a small frying-pan two tablespoonfuls of 
melted butter, and add the cauliflower. Season with 
a teaspoonful of salt and half a teaspoonful of white 
pepper ; toss well once in a while, while cooking on 
the fire for five minutes. Dress on a hot dish, and 
serve. 



GREENS 

Note. — Under this heading come a variety of odds 
and ends in the cabbage line,BUch as broccoli-sprouts, 
our led kale, ''Scotch Kale," turnip-tops, and other 
young green tops and shoots' obtainable in different 
localities. They all can be cooked either like 
asparagus, tied in neat bundles, or like spinach. 
They require careful preliminary picking, trimming, 
and washing. Boil them in as little water as possible, 
with the pan-lid off, and drain them as diy as you 
can. It is, of course, better to steam than to boil 
them ; this wiU take a little longer than the boiling 
time, which should be (according to the vegetable 
in question) about seventeen to twenty minutes. 
Serve with a separate sauce. 

113. BRCKXJOLI SPROUTS BOILBD 

Tie the stems into bundles like asparagus, having 
first washed and trimmed them. Have ready a 
pan of boiling water, into which has been put two 
tablespoonfuls of salt and a tiny pinch of bicarbonate

of soda. Let the broccoli sprouts boil fast until 
quite tender ; drain and dish them on buttered toast. 

CAPSICUMS 

Note. — ^These are little used in the British Isles, 
but largely produced and eaten in continental 
countries and the United States. As a rule, the 
small ones only, suitable for salads and pickles, are 
obtainable here ; but the very large ones, which can 
be stufEed before cooking, are much the best for 
culinary purposes. With greengrocers, chillies and 
capsicums are interchangeable terms. They all 
yield pepper, and belong to that strange order of 
the SolanaceaB, which supplies us with so many com- 
modities, from belladonna to potatoes. 

Preparation. — Practically as for egg-plant. 

114. CAPSICUMS BAKED, No. 1 

Take two or three green capsicums, cut them in 
two lengthways, scoop out the inside, and place 
them in boiling water for five minutes. Remove, 
drain, and stuff each half with finely minced white 
meat — pork, fowl, or veal — mixed with the same 
amount of fine crumbs, and add a little salt, lemon- 
juice, and butter. Place the capsicums in a baking- 
dish, let them stand in just enough stock to keep 
them from sticking — say half an inch — ^and bake. 

115.' CAPSICUMS BAKED, No. 2 

Take large capsicums, cut off the end of each, and 
scoop out the seeds, etc. Place them in a covered 
pan of boiling water for about fifteen minutes, then 
remove and drain, and stuff with a forcemeat made 
thus : equal quantities of fine crumbs and finely 
minced white meat, seasoning of salt and pepper, 
about one tablespoonful (or more, according to 



Digitized by VnOOQ IC 



COOKED PLAINLY OR ELABORATELY 61 

requirements) of butter, softened enough to mix. 
Place the capsicums in an earthen baking-dish, 
dredge them with crumbs, sprinkle some butter over, 
and bake for fifteen to twenty minutes. 

A third method is to fry the capsicums whole 
for one minute in boiling oil or fat, then cut off the 
ends, remove the seeds, etc., and stuff as above, 
or with the addition of nutmeg and thyme in small 
quantities. 

CARDOONS 

Note. — These are but little cultivated over here, 
but on the Continent six or seven varieties are in 
vogue. Cardoons are so unlike any other vegetable, 
that it is well worth while to try them. They are 
of the same family {Cynara) as the globe artichoke ; 
but, whereas with the latter it is the flower-heads 
which are eaten, the cardoon is blanched like celery, 
and the fleshy leaf-stalk (as in celery) is the edible 
part ; there the resemblance stops, because cardoons 
and celery do not taste alike. 

Preparation. — Cardoons should be cut into lengths 
of four or five inches (removing any prickly parts), 
thrown into boiling water with a squeeze of lemon- 
juice, and kept boiling until their outer skin (which 
is woolly) will rub off ; then drain and plunge them 
in cold water. Leave them there till cool, when 
you can scrape them and remove the "strings." 
After this, you proceed to their real cooking. 

116. CARDOONS STEWED 

Having prepared as above, lay the cardoons in a 
stewpan (earthen for choice), with a rasher of raw 
fat bacon over them, and another below. Season 
with salt and pepper, add a small bunch of herbs, 
and just cover the cardoons with white stock or 



Digitized by VnOOQ IC 



62 MAY BYRON'S VEGETABLE BOOK 

milk. Let this liquid come slowly to boiling-point, 
and then simmer gently till the cardoons are quite 
tender ; probably two hours at least. Lift them 
out and drain them, place them in a hot dish, thicken 
the liquor with a little lemon-juice and egg yolk, 
and pour it over them. 

They can also be stewed in blanc (which see) or in 
brown gravy, or served along with marrow. 

CARROTS 

Note. — ^Although the wild carrot is a native 
British plant, the garden one was not used in 
England until the sixteenth century, when the 
Flemings introduced it. It rapidly grew in popular 
favour, and is now practically indispensable in every 
garden. While not suitable for gouty or rheumatic 
persons, it is a wholesome and palatable vegetable 
if properly cooked. Undoubtedly it is at its best 
when very young ; the dainty little carrot newly 
out of the soil is indeed " a good root," as Mistress 
Quickly termed it, and by no means beneath the 
notice of an epicure. 

Preparation. — Scrape the carrots carefully, but 
do not cut them ; in the case of very young ones 
it is really better not to scrape them, as the mere 
film of skin can be so easily wiped off with a soft 
cloth when they are cooked. Place them in boiling 
salted water, and boil until tender, which will be 
in thirty to sixty minutes, according to age and size. 
Serve in a heated dish, with a little butter, pepper, 
and salt (and some people add chopped parsley). 
Older carrots may be chopped into very small dice, 
or made into a pur6e.

peppers, one teaspoonful of fine sugar, half an ounce 
of butter, one pint and a half of hot broth or hot 
water. Cover the pan and cook on a very brisk 
fire for fifteen minutes, or till the carrots are thor- 
oughly soft. 

Place in a small saucepan three-quarters of an 
ounce of butter, with one tablespoonful of flour ; 
stir and heat well ; then strain the liquor of the 
carrots into this roux, adding a gill of hot milk ; 
mix well, and as soon as it comes to a boil transfer 
the carrots only into this pan, adding one teaspoonful 
of chopped parsley. Carefully mix without crushing 
the carrots ; boil for five minutes longer. Poiur into 
a hot deep dish, and serve. 

118. CARROTS COLBERT 

Scrape and thoroughly wash twenty-four even- 
sized new carrots ; drain, place in a small saucepan

saltspoonfuls of white pepper. Gently roll them in 
the seasoning. Cover the pan, place it on the fire 
for five minutes, then set in the oven for fifty 
minutes. Remove (the juice must be nearly evapor- 
ated) ; add half a giU of hot demi-glace (No. 704), 
the juice of half a lemon, and half a teaspoonful of 
freshly chopped parsley ; carefully mix without 
brealdng, dress them with a skimmer on a vegetable 
dish, pour the sauce over, and serve.

120. CARROTS FRIED 

Boil some carrots till quite tender ; slice them in 
halves, the long way, and put them into a stewpan 
in which at least two tablespoonf uls of butter have 
been heated to boiling-point. Strew over the 
carrots salt and pepper to taste, and one teaspoonful 
each of castor sugar and finely minced parsley. Let 
them fry until they show brown and crisp outside. 



121. CARROTS (FLEMISH METHOD) 

Take some young carrots ; parboil and drain 
, them ; put them in a stewpan with a little butter, 
(jknd not less than a teaspoonful of sugar. Just cover 
them with hot water, and stir in salt and pepper to 
taste, with a teaspoonful of finely minced parsley. 
Put them to simmer slowly for a quarter of an hour,

CELERY 

NoTB. — Celery, like asparagus and seakale, is a 
wild maritime plant native to Britain ; it may, 
however, be found inland. It is probably as old a 
garden plant as any in cultivation, and is not only 
singularly appetising (its strong aromatic odour being 
as attractive as its flavour), but it is of excellent 
food- value, and to be recommended to those gouty 
and rheumatic folks from whom so many other 
vegetables are debarred. Whether used raw, in salads 
{see Chap. VIII.), as a flavouring to soups, stews, 
and boiled meats, or as a separate cooked vegetable, 
celery is equally valuable ; and there is nothing in 
the market exactly like it, except celeriac (which 
see), but this latter, being a root and not a stalk, is 
probably less wholesome. 

Preparation. — Remove the outside leaves and 
any disfigured or browned outer stalks, and cut 
away the green parts ; but on no account throw 
these away. Trim the remaining stalks, wash and 
cut them up in six-inch lengths, tie in neat bundles, 
as for asparagus, place in boiling, salted water, 
and cook until the celery is tender when tested by 
a fork. Serve in any way suggested for seakale. 



126. CELERY BRAISED, No. 1 

Place a small mirepoix (see No. 751) in a roasting- 
pan, with one ounce of melted butter. Let the 
mirepoix get a nice light brown, then lay six stalks of 
fine, well-cleaned white celery over the vegetables ; 
season with a teaspoonful of salt and half a teaspoon* 
ful of white pepper ; pour in hot water or broth to 
nearly cover the celery. Briskly boil for five minutes 
on the range. Cover the celery with a sheet of 
buttered paper. Set the pan in the oven for forty

miniiteB. Remove, set the celery on a hot dish, 
and serve. 

127. CELERY BRAISED, No. 2 

Remove the outer stalks and leaves from a good 
head of celery ; wash it well, cut into even lengths, 
and tie firmly in a bundle. Have one carrot, one 
turnip, and one onion cleaned and cut up small. 
Have two rashers of bacon, cut into four pieces. 
Lay all these with the celery in a stewpan, with a 
bunch of pot-herbs and seasoning of salt and 
pepper. Cover the vegetable with stock — ^white 
for preference. Let this just boil up, and then 
simmer gently till the celery is tender — ^about thirty 
minutes. Remove the celery, and dish it on toast, 
with a HoUandaise sauce poured over it, on the 
top of which crumbs and grated cheese can be 
sprinkled and browned in the oven ; or simply 
strain and thicken the stock, browning it if it be 
brown stock, and serve it over the celery and toast. 

128. CELERY BRAISED, No. 8 

Trim away the outside leaves of three heads of 
celery, cut the roots to a point, and trim off the 
tops of the stalks, leaving the heads six inches in 
length ; wash and blanch ten minutes in boiling 
water, drain, cover with cold water, and wash 
carefully. Tie the heads in a bundle, and put in a 
stewpan with a pint and a half of boiling stock or 
water, or half of each ; add a quarter of a cup of fat 
from the top of the stock, half a carrot, half an onion, 
one teaspoonf ul of salt, and a few grains of cayenne ; 
cover and let simmer an hour or until tender. Drain 
out the celery, strain the liquid, and remove the fat ; 
use the liquid in making about a cup of brown sauce. 
Pour this over the celery. Garnish with outlet- 
shaped pieces of bread fried in butter.

129. CBEAIIED CELEBY IN CHEESE SHELL 

Cut the cleaned celery stalks in pieces an inch long, 
and let cook in boiling water to cover until tender. 
For three breakfastcups of pieces make a pint of 
white sauce, using the water in which the celery 
was cooked, with cream as the liquid. Turn all into 
the shell of a Dutch cheese, cover the top with 
half a cup of fine crumbs, mixed with two table- 
spoonfuls of melted butter, and let brown in the 
oven. Serve a light scraping of cheese with each 
helping of celery. For a more elaborate service, 
add parboiled oysters with the celery, and use the 
oyster liquor in making the sauce as a part of the 
liquid. 

130. CELERY AND CHEESE AU GRATIN 

One pint of cooked celery, one pint of white sauce, 
three-quarters of a cup of grated cheese, three- 
quar^rs of a cup of fine bread-crumbs, one-third 
of a cup of melted butter. 

Have the celery cut in half-inch pieces before 
cooking. Use the water in which it was cooked, 
with white stock and cream, in making the sauce. 
Put alternate layers of celery and sauce in a but- 
tered pie-dish, and sprinkle each layer with cheese. 
Cover the top with the crumbs mixed with the 
melted butter and any cheese remaining. Set in 
the oven to brown the crumbs. Garnish with 
curled celery, celery leaves, and quarters of hard- 
boiled eggs. 

131. CELERY WITH SCRAMBLED EGGS

133. CELERY FRIED 

Take some cold celery which has been plain boiled ; 
cut it into small pieces, and fry them in dripping 
until lightly browned. 

134. CELERY FRITTERS 

This is a method of using the green parts of 
celery — ^young leaves and green stalks — ^which are 
generally discarded as uneatable. Wash them and 
mince them very finely ; about a breakfastcupful 
of chopped celery will be enough. Make a thick 
batter with one ^g, one pint of flour, one teaspoon- 
ful of baking-powder, salt and pepper to taste, and 
enough milk to moisten the mixture ; add in the 
celery, and put large tablespoonfuls of the batter 
into boiling fat. SVy a golden brown, drain, and 
serve.

Place them in a saucepan with a two-ounce piece 
of salt pork, an onion with two cloves stuck in it, 
pint of broth, gill of water, teaspoonful of salt, and 
three saltspoonf uls of pepper ; boil for forty-five 
minutes, then take up pork and onions. Mix in 
a saucepan an ounce of butter and one ounce and a 
half of flour ; strain to this the celery broth, and 
sharply mix until it comes to a boil; add celery, 
with a saltspoonful each of cayenne and grated 
nutmeg ; mix well, and let boil for ten minutes. 
Transfer celery, etc., to baking-dish ; sprinkle a little 
Swiss cheese over, and set in oven for ten minutes ; 
remove and serve. 

13«. CELERY IN GLASS 

Pare ofE the green stalks of one fine, large bunch 
of{white, tender, crisp celery ; neatly trim the roots, 
being careful to save the clear, white hearts. Cut 
each stalk lengthwise into four equal branches. 
Wash them well in cold water, and plunge in clean 
water with a piece of ice until ready to serve ; then 
arrange them in a celery glass and serve. 

137. CELERY AU GRATIN 

Cut a large head of celery and boil it in half milk 
and half water till it is tender ; drain and put it into 
a buttered dish in layers. Make white sauce with 
the liquor thickened with cornflour, and pour 
over. Put grated cheese and breadcrumbs on the 
top. Bake till it is brown. 

138. CELERY WITH POTATOES 

Take some cold, cooked potatoes, and pass them 
through a coarse sieve, until you have three oupfuls. 
Take some cooked celery, mince it finely, and mix 
it well with the potatoes ; add salt and pepper to

taste, and sufficient cream or milk to moisten it 
thoroughly. Put it in a shallow stewpan, and 
bring it to boiling-point, but stir it and toss it 
frequently to prevent it burning and ensure its 
getting properly heated. 

189. CELERY SOUFFLE 

Thoroughly wash and strain two stalks of fresh, 
crisp celery ; remove green leaves and finely slice 
stalks. Place in saucepan with sliced white part 
of a leek, a small branch of parsley, a branch of 
chervil, blade of mace and bay leaf. Pour in enough 
white broth to cover celery, season with level tea- 
spoonful of salt ; cover pan, and let gently boil for 
thirty minutes. Remove, take out the bay and 
mace, then press celery through sieve into a bowl. 

Mix in a saucepan two tablespoonfuk of melted 
butter, three tablespoonfuk of flour, and pour in 
one gill and a half of milk ; add the pur^ of celery, 
with an ounce of grated Parmesan cheese and a salt- 
spoonful of cayenne pepper, then briskly stir with 
a wooden spoon until thoroughly boiling ; add two 
egg yolks, sharply stir for three minutes longer, and 
remove from range. Beat up whites of the two eggs 
to a stiff froth, add to celery, and mix well. Fill 
up six round paper cases, place them on a tin, and 
set in oven for twenty minutes ; remove, dress on 
a hot dish, and send to table immediately. 

140. CELERY STEWED, No. 1 

Having washed and stripped the stems, cut up 
the celery into four-inch pieces, and place in a stew- 
pan, just covered with stock (white for choice).

141. CELERY STEWED, No. 2 

Cut away the outer leaves of two sticks of celery, 
and lay them in a saucepan with equal parts of 
boiling water and milk to cover them. Boil for 
about two hours, or until tender. Dish up the 
celery. Make some melted butter with some of the 
liquor from the celery, pour over, and serve very 
hot. Skimmed milk alone is better to boil the 
celery in than milk and water. 

142. CELERY STEWED, No. 3 

Having trimmed the celery, leaving only the 
tender leaves, and washed it, put it into a saucepan 
with boiling water to blanch, and when it has become 
sufficiently tender to yield to the pressure of the 
finger, take it out, and throw it into cold water ; 
then mash it up with a knife in the same way as 
chicory or endive. Put it into a saucepan with a 
bit of butter, a little salt, three or four whole 
peppercorns, and a small quantity of nutmeg. 
Pour upon it about half a pint of mixed stock and 
velout6 sauce ; or, for want of these, water mixed 
with some good gravy, and let reduce until it has 
become thick. It is then to be served in a dish 
garnished with slices of bread fried in butter. 

143. CELERY EN SURPRISE 

Pare off the green branches of two stalks of fine, 
fresh, white celery. Separate all the branches, nicely 
trim the tender parts as well as the roots, and pla.ce 
them in a basin with plenty of cold water and wash 
thoroughly. Remove the branches from the basin, 
lay them on a towel, and then with the forefinger 
gently spread a very little green butter on the 
inside of each branch. Dress on a celery dish. 
(Always keep the discarded celery for soups or for 
other useful purposes.)

CELERIAC 

Note. — ^This very good vegetable is also known 
as turnip-rooted celery ; the root, not the stalk, is 
eaten, and a tasty dish it makes. As it stands 
hard weather much better than celery, and needs 
no blanching, and will keep well for six months, I 
cannot think why, as a nation, we do not employ it 
more. But we are nothing if not groovy. 

Preparation. — Celeriac roots can be peeled, quar- 
tered, and blanched before boiling ; cooked and 
sliced in vinegar like beetroot ; sliced raw and 
fried in butter ; boiled and served with sauce ; 
made into a pur6e, etc., etc., etc. 

144. CELERIAC BOILED 

Prepare as above, and place in fast-boiling, salted 
water, with a squeeze of lemon (to preserve the 
colour). Boil fast tiU tender ; drain, and serve 
with good white sauce. 

145. CELERIAC STEWED 

Prepare as above ; place in boiling stock, and par- 
boil ; then remove, drain, and put into a stewpan, 
covered with a rich brown sauce. Let simmer 
gently till tender. 

CHERVIL 

NoTB. — ^There are two chervils— one a fine-leaved 
salad herb, and one a bulbous-rooted vegetable, 
rather like a small parsnip in shape and colour, but 
of a quite distinct taste and a more floury texture. 
It is seldom grown, but is advisable as a change. 
Our Anglo-Saxon forefathers used it extensively, 
as do the Continental nations now. 



Digitized by VnOOQ IC 



74 MAY BYRON'S VEGETABLE BOOK 

Preparation. — ^The roots should be washed and 
cleaned, but not cut or scraped. They take long 
cooking, and should simmer, but not boil. 

146. CHERVIL BOILED 

Prepare as above. Put the roots into a stewpan, 
with a little salt. Pour over them sufficient boiling 
weak stock, or boiling water, just to cover them ; 
let them cook gently for at least one hour and a half. 

147. CHERVIL FRIED 

Proceed as above, but when the roots are par- 
boiled, say in about an hour, remove, drain, and wipe 
them dry ; cut them into lengthwise strips, and fry 
them a golden brown in boiling butter. 



CHICORY OR ENDIVE 

Note. — Either as a cooked or as a salad vegetable, 
chicory is most desirable and wholesome, deserving 
far more notice than it gets. Both the green leaves 
and blanched stems are edible ; the first are cooked 
somewhat like spinach, the second like seakale. 
The varieties most in commercial use are Witloof^ 
or Brussels chicory, and Barbe de Capucin — wild 
endive or succory. This last, boasting one of the 
loveliest blue flowers imaginable, may be met with 
in limestone districts — it is common, for instance, 
in Dorsetshire. 

Preparaiion. — ^The young green leaves should be 
placed for five minutes in boiling, salted water, 
drained, plunged into cold water, and drained again, 
as a preliminary to the actual cooking. Use plenty 
of water (salted), as chicory is apt to harbour insects. 
The blanched stems are treated like seakale (which 
see).

148. CHICORY (BOILED LEAVES) 

Prepare as above. Chop up the drained leaves, 
and have ready in a saucepan a heated mixture as 
follows : to each pound of fresh leaves allow half 
an ounce of butter, quarter of an ounce of flour, and 
seasoning of salt and pepper; mix well, and stir 
over a slow fire ; after about five minutes, add one 
teacupful of white stock or milk, and let all simmer 
till nearly dry. Remove from fl^e, stir in one ounce 
of butter, and serve with hot buttered toast. 

149. CHICORY (BAKED STALKS) 

Prepare some heads of chicory, by trimming and 
washing them, and boil them in salted water with 
a squeeze of lemon-juice. Drain them as dry as 
possible. Put enough white sauce to cover the 
bottom of a buttered pie-dish, and place the chicory 
in it. If there is not enough sauce to cover it, add 
a little white stock. Dust thickly with grated 
cheese, and bake in a good oven. 

160. ENDIVE STEWED 

Take four or five heads of endive, break them in 
pieces, mash and drain them. Cook them in boiling, 
salted water over a shsurp fire ; when they are tender, 
pass them through a colander, press dry, and mince 
finely. Have ready in a saucepan an ounce of 
butter, seasoned with salt, pepper, and nutmeg ; 
turn the endives into this, and let them simmer 
twenty minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in a little 
cream, and serve on toast or with fried croiitons. 

CUCUMBERS 

NoTB. — ^These, like most other edible members 
of the great order CucurbitacecBy such as the 
gouid, melon, vegetable marrow, etc., are widely

diffused in locality, and of almost immeasurable 
antiquity, regarded as cultivated garden vege- 
tables, or fruits, to be quite accurate. Candidly, 
I can't imagine why they have always been so 
popular, because their sustaining and nourishing 
qualities are by no means of the highest. I think 
the rapidity of their growth, and the dispropor- 
tionately large size of their fruitage as compared 
to the plant itself, must have commended the 
Cucumbers and Co. to our remote ancestors in 
all parts of the world. Qourds and melons are 
mentioned in the earlier books of the Bible ; the 
prophet Isaiah speaks of a garden of cucumbers ; 
but there is no evidence that the more valuable 
food-vegetables were held in similar esteem, most 
of these latter, indeed, being principally grown in 
temperate or cool countries. However, here we 
have the cucumber still with us, and although to 
many people it is synonymous with a violent in- 
digestion, let these sufferers try it cooked and hot 
instead of cold in vinegar, and they may yet respect 
and affect this slim and elegant growth. Qherkins 
are very small young cucumbers pickled. 

Preparation, — ^Never let the flesh of the cucumber 
come into contact with your fing^s whilst you peel 
it, otherwise it becomes bitter and acrid. I believe 
that cucumbers would be excellent plain boiled 
with the peel on (to be subsequently removed when 
they were cooked), or done after any method suitable 
to vegetable marrows ; but this is a theory only. 
Of course, the fresher a cucumber is, the better ; 
you can test this by its being firm and stiff instead of 
feeble and flabby. 

151. CUCUMBERS B]£CHAM£L 

Peel three good-sized fresh cucumbers; cut 
them into quarters, lengthwise, remove the seeds.

154. CUCUMBERS FRIED 

Peel two large fresh cucumbers, then cut them 
crosswise in one-inch pieces, and cut each piece in 
quarters. Remove the spongy part and seeds, 
place in one quart of cold water with a teaspoonful 
of salt, and let soak for thirty minutes. Drain and 
place in small saucepan with half an ounce of butter, 
two gills of water, a teaspoonful of powdered sugar, 
two saltspoonfuls of salt, a tablespoonful of vinegar, 
half a saltspbonf ul of cayenne, and one white onion 
out in quarters. Cover the pan and let cook for

COOKED PLAINLY OR ELABORATELY 79 

(not to make it too thin), and shake them well 
together with a Uttle flour. You may lay these 
round your mutton as a sauce, or they are proper 
for a side-dish. 

166. CUCUMBER RAGOtrr 

Cut two large cucumbers into nice-sized pieces; 
peel them, and fry in boiling fat with an onion cut 
in rings. When all are browned, add a qua^r of

157. CUCUMBERS, ROMAINB 

Peel two good-sized sound cucumbers, cut in 
halves, remove spongy parts, finely slice, place in 
a quart of cold water with a teaspoonf ul of salt for 
thirty minutes, and drain thoroughly on a sieve. 
Lightly butter a baking-dish, sprinkle in it a table- 
spoonful of grated Parmesan or Swiss cheese, and 
arrange a layer of half the quantity of cucumbers 
over; season with three saltspoonfuls each of salt 
and pepper, a saltspoonful of grated nutmeg, and 
dredge a tablespoonful of Parmesan cheese over all. 
Divide half an ounce of butter in very little bits on 
top, and place remaining cucumbers in layers on top ; 
season with two saltspoonfuls of salt and one salt- 
spoonful of pepper. Sprinkle a light tablespoonful of

five minutes, tossing meanwhile. Mix well in a small 
saucepan a tablespoonf ul each of butter and flour ; 
pour in three-quarters of a gill of milk and a gill of 
cream. Sharply stir until it comes to a boil, add 
cucumbers, a level teaspoonful of salt, saltspoonful 
each of cayenne and grated nutmeg ; thoroughly mix 
with a wooden spooti ; cook for five minutes ; dress 
cucumbers on a hot vegetable dish, and serve. 

159. CUCUMBERS SAUTES (LYONNAISE) 
Heat in a frying-pan one tablespoonful and a half 
of melted butter ; add a medium, sliced white 
onion ; stir well while browning for two minutes, 
then add two large peeled and sliced fresh cucumbers. 
Season with half a teaspoonful of salt and two salt- 
spoonfuls of white pepper ; toss gently and briskly ; 
cook for five minutes, frequently tossing meanwhile ; 
then pour in a tablespoonful of vinegar, adding a tea- 
spoonful of freshly chopped parsley ; toss them well 
again while cooking for half a minute. Dress on a 
hot dish, and serve. 

160. CUCUMBERS STEWED 
Take three medium-sized cucumbers ; remove 
the skin and seeds, slice them about quarter of an 
inch thick. Cut a large onion in slices, and place 
it in a stewpan with the cucumber, and enough 
stock just to cover all — ^probably half a pint will 
suffice. Boil till tender ; then remove the veget- 
ables, and thicken the liquor with two beaten yolks ; 
add salt, pepper, and nutmeg to taste, and beat up 
the mixture, but don't let it boil ; then, having 
placed the vegetables in a hot dish, pour the sauce 
over them. 

161. CUCUMBERS STUFFED 
Take three large cucumbers, pare them, and re- 
move the seeds with a scoop. Put them into fast-

boiling water for three minutes, then drain and put 
them into cold water. Take the breast of a chicken, 
or four ounces of veal, and pound or mince it into a 
paste ; add the same weight of bread steeped in 
milk, two beaten yolks, and an eggspoonf ul of butter ; 
also salt, pepper, and nutmeg to taste. If this 
mixture is too stiff, moisten it with a few drops of 
milk. Stuff the cucumbers with it, and place them 
in a shallow stewpan in which a rasher of bacon has 
been fried. Place around them a few herbs, such as 
a sprig of thyme, three or four sprigs of parsley, and 
a bay leaf, with a couple of cloves, and add enough 
white stock to stew the cucumbers in. Keep the 
lid on, but baste them frequently. They should 
be done in twenty-five to thirty minutes. Dish at 
once, with a rich brown sauce served separately. 



DANDELION 

NoTB. — ^It is almost comic to think of consuming 
this constellation of our roadsides, this enemy of 
our lawns ; but the medicinal properties of dande- 
lion, as a purifier of the blood, are too noteworthy 
to be neglected, and whether as a salad or a culinary 
green-stuff, it should be sincerely recommended. 
The young green leaves can be used raw ; when a 
little older, they can be cooked ; the roots are 
pleasantly bitter, and not unlike salsify when pre- 
pared in a similar way. 

Gather dandelion early in the morning ; and do 
not spare water in washing and blanching it. 

Preparaiian. — ^The leaves must be well picked, 
washed in two or three waters, and well drained 
before you start cooking. They can be mingled, 
at pleasure, with an equal amount of sorrel leaves. 
They can be treated as spinach or chicory (which 
see). The roots must be thoroughly scraped, and

boiled in salted water with a squeeze of lemon, 
until they are firm but quite cooked, when they may 
be treated as salsify or celery (which see). 

162. DANDEUON BOILED, No. 1 

Prepare as above ; boil fast for thirty minutes ; 
remove and place in cold water. Press the moisture 
gradually out till the leaves are more or less dry ; 
then chop small. Put the leaves into a stewpan, in 
which you have ready mixed one tablespoonful of 
stock, one ounce of butter, one dessertspoonful of 
flour, and a seasoning of salt and pepper. Let the 
leaves become thoroughly hot in this, stirring them 
carefully with a wooden spoon for ten minutes or so ; 
then add one tablespoonful of cream, and serve with 
fried croAtons. 

163. DANDELION BOILED, No. 2 

Take an equal quantity of young dandelion 
leaves and young sorrel leaves ; chop them separ- 
ately. Put the dandelion leaves into a very small 
quantity of boiling, salted water, cook them till 
tender ; then put in the sorrel leaves, and let boil 
till the water is all boiled away ; add salt, pepper, 
and butter, and serve very hot along with poached 
eggs on toast. 

EGG-PLANT OR AUBERGINE 

Note. — ^Although this curious plants which is of 
the Solanum or potato tribe, has been known to 
English gardeners for at least three hundred years, 
it is but little grown or appreciated. One sees it in 
the greengrocers' shops ; but not as one sees it in 
the French markets. In the United States it is a 
popular and standard vegetable. In India it is 
largely used and termed brinjcU. Usually egg-

shaped, but sometimes as long as a oucumber, the 
fruit of the egg-plant is to be had in various colours — 
chiefly red and purple, but also white, cream, and 
violet. A very nice and wholesome vegetable it is, 
too ; only most housewives are so mortally afraid 
of anything they don't know previously. 

PreparaHon. — ^In almost all cases the seeds are re- 
moved (unless they are so young as to be unde- 
veloped), and the fruit is stuffed. The pulp is often 
returned to the shell or pod, mixed with various 
seasonings and ingredients. 

164. EGG-PLANT BAKED 

Cut the fruit in halves, lengthways ; scoop out 
the fleshy part, mash it up with a little butter, 
salt, pepper, and a minced hard-boiled egg. Fill 
the hollowed half -pods with this mixture, brush over 
with melted butter, and bake in a moderate oven. 

165. EGG-PLANT BROILED 

Peel and cut a medium egg-plant into quarter- 
inch slices. Mix on a plate a tablespoonful of oil, a 
teaspoonful of salt, and half a teaspoonful of pepper. 
Turn pieces in seasoning, arrange on a double broUer, 
and broil three minutes on each side. Remove, 
dress on a dish, and serve. 

166. EGG-PLANT FRIED 

Remove the skin and cut the plant into slices a 
quarter of an inch thick. Sprinkle the slices with 
salt, pile them one above another, and set a plate 
holding a weight upon the top. Let stand a^ 
hour to drain off the juice. Dip in egg, then in 
breadcrumbs, and saut^, first one side and then on 
the other, to a golden-brown.

167. EGG-PLANT WITH FRIED EGGS 

Neatly peel a small egg-plant ; cut it into six 
equal slices, and place on a soup plate. Season with 
a teaspoonful of salt, half a teaspoonful of white 
pepper, adding half a gill of cold milk ; turn well in 
the seasoning, then in flour. 

Heat two tablespoonfuls of butter in a large black 
frying-pan, lay the egg-plants, one beside another, 
in the pan, and gently fry for three minutes on 
each side. Carefully crack six eggs over the 
slices; season the eggs evenly with a teaspoonful 
of salt and half a teaspoonful of white pepper ; then 
set the pan in the oven, and bake for five minutes. 
Remove, carefully slide on a large hot dish, and 
serve. 

168. EGG-PLANT, LYONNAISB 

Peel and cut an egg-plant in half-inch square 
pieces ; lift them up, and drain on a cloth. Cut a 
medium onion in half, then finely slice it and fry in 
frying-pan with two tablespoonfuls of melted butter 
for six minutes, occasionally stirring meanwhile ; 
then add the egg-plant. Se£^n with a teaspoonful 
of salt and half a teaspoonful of pepper, and slowly 
cook for fifteen minutes. Pour in a tablespoonful of 
vinegar, and half a teaspoonful of freshly chopped 
parsley ; toss well, cook for two minutes, dress on a 
hot, deep dish, and serve. 

169. EGG-PLANT STUFFED (MARSEILLAISE) 

Cut three small egg-plants into halves, lengthwise, 
make a few criss-crosses in the meat of the plants 
without cutting the shells, then plunge in boiling 
fat, cut side downward, and fry for ten minutes.

chop. Heat a tablespoonful of melted butter in 
a saucepan ; add a small, chopped onion, and fry 
for three minutes ; then add the egg-plant, with 
two seeded, peeled, red, fresh, chopped tomatoes. 
Season with a light teaspoonful of salt and three 
saltspoonf uls of pepper ; add a teaspoonful of freshly 
chopped parsley and half clove of finely chopped 
garlic. Mix well with wooden spoon, and let cook 
for fifteen minutes, occasionally stirring meanwhile ; 
then add four tablespoonf uls of fresh breadcrumbs ; 
mix well, and with this preparation fill up the six 
half-shells. Place on a tin, sprinkle a Uttle bread- 
crumbs over, arrange a few little bits of butter on 
top; set in oven to bake for fifteen minutes ; remove, 
di^ on a hot dish, and serve. 

170. EGG-PLANT STUFFED (PROVENgALE) 

Cut into even halves three very small, sound egg- 
plants. Make a few incisions inside each piece 
without disturbing the peels ; then gently drop 
them into boiling fat — inside parts downward — ^and 
fry for eight minutes. Remove them with a skimmer, 
and let drain on a towel for ten minutes again, with 
cut parts downward ; then with a teaspoon scoop 
out all the meat, and mince it fine. 

Chop very finely six medium-sized, sound shallots, 
and fry them in a frying-pan with half a teaspoonful 
of butt-er for one minute ; then add the scooped-out 
meat, with a tablespoonful of finely chopped 
parsley, two tablespoonfuls of chopped mushrooms, 
half a clove of sound, finely crushed garlic. Season 
with one teaspoonful of salt, half a teaspoonful of 
white pepper, adding also half an ounce of fresh 
breadcrumbs, one giU of tomato sauce (No. 683), 
and one whole r^w egg. Thoroughly mix with a 
wooden spoon until well thickened; then fill the 
six egg-plant shells with the forcemeat. Arrange

on a baking-difih ; spread over each a small quantity 
of breadorumbs, with a few very little bits of butter 
on top ; then set to bake in a brisk oven for fifteen 
minutes. Remove, dress on a hot dish, and serve. 

171. EOO-PLANT, TURQUE 

Cut in two, lengthwise, three small, sound egg- 
plants, criss-cross the flesh inside, without cutting 
skin, then fry in boiling fat, cut side down, and let 
drain for ten minutes. With a teaspoon scoop out 
the pulp, leaving the shells intact. Finely chop 
pulp and keep on a plate. Heat two tablespoonfuls 
of oil in a saucepan ; add one finely chopped white 
onion, and gently brown five minutes ; then add 
two ounces of raw rice, with half a clove of finely 
chopped garlic ; lightly brown five minutes, stirring 
once in a while ; add egg-plant meat, with two gills 
of tomato sauce (No. 683), half a tea^spoonful of salt, 
three saltspoonfuls of pepper» and saltspoonful of 
nutmeg ; mix well, cover pan, set in oven forty-five 
minutes. Remove, add two egg yolks, thoroughly 
mix, sprinkle half a teaspoonful of salt in the egg- 
plant shells, then fill with the preparation. Sprinkle 
a little breadcrumbs over, place on a tin, arrange 
a few bits of butter over each, set in oven for fifteen 
minutes. Remove and serve. 

172. EGG-PLANT AND TOBiATO (ATHiJNIENNE) 

Peel a small egg-plant ; then cut into six even 
slices. Neatly trim all round, season with half a 
teaspoonfiil of salt and two saltspoonfuls of pepper, 
and lightly roll them in flour. Heat a tablespoonful 
of lard in a frying-pan, arrange the egg-plant slices 
one beside another in the pan, and fry for three 
minutes on each side. Remove and place on a 
lightly buttered tin. Place in a mortar two skinned, 
raw sausages, half a teaspoonful each of chopped 



Digitized by VnOOQ IC 



COOKED PLAINLY OR ELABORATELY 87 

parsley and chives, half a clove of chopped garlic, 
two tablespoonfols of breadcrumbs, half a gill of 
cream, one egg yolk, two saltspoonfuls of salt, one 
saltspoonful of cayenne and a saltspoonful of grated 
nutmeg ; then pound the whole together to a 
smooth paste, and evenly spread over the six slices 
of egg-plant. Cut three medium, red tomatoes into 
halves crosswise. Evenly season the cut part with 
half a teaspoonful each of salt and sugar, and two 
saltspoonfiiis of white pepper ; then arrange a piece 
of tomato on top of each egg-plant, cut side down- 
ward. Spread half a teaspoonful of melted butter 
over the tomatoes, evenly divided, and place in the 
oven to bake for twenty minutes ; remove, dress on 
a hot dish, and serve. 

HOPS 

Note. — Young hop shoots, four to five inches long, 
make a nice change as a green vegetable, and are 
(in hop districts) extremely cheap. Cold, cooked 
hops are a very good addition to a salad. 

Prepaf€Uion. — Much as for asparagus — i.e., the 
hops must be slightly scraped, washed, and tied in 
neat bundles — or they can be fried (see below). 

178. HOPS BOILED 

Prepare as above ; put into salted boiling water 
or weak stock ; boil quickly for about twenty 
minutes ; serve with a good, plain sauce. Reserve 
any which remain till next day, to use cold in salads. 

174. HOPS FRIED 

After preparing as above, boil the young hop 
shoots in salted water with a squeeze of lemon, till 
they are three-parts done — say about twelve minutes ; 
then drain and shake them a little. Leave them to

get cool, after dusting on a little salt. When they 
are cold, flour them, dip in egg and breadcrumbs, 
and fry in boiling oil or fat. If any sauce is served, 
let it be a sharp one ; or hand round a plate of cut 
lemon. 



FINOCCHIO, OR FLORENCE FENNEL 

Note. — ^As in the case of chervil, there are two 
kinds of fennel — ^the herb and the vegetable. The 
ordinary aromatic garden fennel (which see) is quite 
another thing from the Italian finoochio, which is 
used like blanched celery, either raw or cooked, the 
thick round leaf-stalks only being employed. 

Finoochio is a particularly pleasing vegetable, and, 
once known, will always be wanted, " by reason,'* 
to quote Parkinson, '* of sweetnesse by nature, and 
tendernesse by art." 

Preparation. — ^As for celery or chicory (which see). 
Stock is better than water for cooking finocchio. 
It should be served with a rich, thick sauce. 



LEEK 

Note.— The national emblem of Wales is closely 
related to the onion ; in other words, it is a plebeian 
member of the great patrician family of the LUiacecB. 
It is milder than the onion, and more delicate in 
flavour, even as the onion is milder and less rank 
than garlic. Leeks are good, wholesome winter 
vegetables, and generally flnd favour as a family 
dish. Like most other vegetables, they are much 
the best when young and tender. 

Preparation. — ^Well wash the leeks, remove the 
green tops and the fibrous part of the roots ; cut 
them into shorty equal lengths, of four to five inches. 



Digitized by VnOOQ IC 



COOKED PLAINLY OR ELABORATELY 89 

and place them in fast-boiling salted water for not 
more than six minutes ; then drain off the water, 
and substitute a very small quantity of (boiling) 
stock, just enough to cover the leeks in a shallowish 
pan. liCt them boil in this until quite tender. 

175. LEEKS BOILED, No. 1 

Having washed and trimmed the leeks, lay them 
in fast-boiling salted water, and cook till properly 
tender. Drain them, place them in a hot veget- 
able dish on buttered toast, and pour a good white 
sauce over them. 

176. LEEKS BOILED, No. 2 

Take six leeks about as thick as a finger, cut them 
all to equal length, leaving hardly any of the green 
part. Wash and trim them carefully, and tie them 
in a bundle. Place them in a small stewpan, in a 
little salted boiling water, and parboil for five minutes. 
Drain, and place them in a clean saucepan containing 
three-quarters of a pint of milk and about half a tea- 
spoonful of sugar. Stew them in this for twenty 
minutes or more, till they are quite tender, and lay 
them on slices of toast in a vegetable-dish. Keep 
them warm while you thicken the milk with half 
an ounce each of butter and flour, well worked 
together. Season with pepper and salt. When 
this mixture boils, pour it over the leeks, and serve. 

177. LEEKS WITH CHEESE 

Prepare the leeks, cut them into three-inch 
lengths, and plunge them in fast-boiling salted water. 
In a few minutes drain off the water, and replace 
it with just enough good stock to cover the leeks. 
When they are nearly cooked, remove, drain, and 
place them in a pie-dish ; strew them thickly with 



Digitized by VnOOQ IC 



90 MAY BYRON'S VEGETABLE BOOK 

grated cheese, and put into a good oven till the cheese 
is nicely browned. 

178. LEEKS DEVILLED 

Procure twelve even-sized leeks ; trim off stems, 
outer stale leaves, and cut green parts one inch from 
white parts, using white parts only. Thoroughly 
wash in cold water and drain on a cloth, place 
in a braising-pan with two branches of parsley, 
a branch of chervil, clove, bay leaf, sprig of thyme, 
and half an ounce of butter. Moisten with half 
a gill of white wine and gill of broth; season 
with half a teaspoonful of salt and three saltspoon- 
fuls of pepper. Cover pan, and briskly boil on the 
fire for five minutes, then set in oven for thirty 
minutes. Remove to a table, take up with skimmer, 
and split them open without separating. Place six 
slices of toasted bread in a baking-dish ; arrange 
the leeks over toasts ; strain gravy through a cheese- 
cloth into baking-dish ; spread a tablespoonful of 
French mustard and dredge a little breadcrumbs 
over leeks ; then set in oven for fifteen minutes ; 
remove, and serve. 

170. LEEKS, FRIED 

Take six small leeks, and use the white parts only ; 
the green tops can be used for soup. Well wash and 
cut them into three-inch pieces. Put into a stew- 
pan with half a pint of milk, one bay leaf, and a pinch 
of mace. Boil slowly till the leeks are soft but 
whole. Carefully remove and drain them. Have 
ready half a pint of thick white sauce, dip each piece 
into this, then stand it in a sieve to set firm. Then 
egg-and-breadcrumb each piece — this must be done 
very carefully, and is better for doing twice. Fry 
in deefp boiling fat. Drain the leeks, sprinkle with 
salt and pepper, serve at once.

LENTILS 

Note. — ^Lentils, belonging to the great Legum- 
inous family which provides the earth with so 
much food, are not much eaten over here. They 
are, it would seem, mostly used in a dried state, and 
their nutritious properties are chiefly confined to 
the ripened seed. In France and other Continental 
countries, brown lentils are used ; in Egypt, Syria, 
and the East in general, red ones, such as those 
which the hungry Esau greatly desired in Jacob's 
pottage : " Feed me, I pray thee, with that red " 
(marginal reading) . . . '' Then Jacob «gave Esau 
bread and pottage of lentils." 

Whether red lentils be worth one's birthright or 
no, however famished one may be, personally I 
think the brown ones are the best, ^^d they are 
supposed to be particularly nourishing to invalids 
and delicate stomachs ; though undoubtedly in 
some folk they breed flatulence and dyspepsia. The 
great point is, to have them thoroughly well cooked, 
and no trace of the tough, hard, outer skins allowed 
to remain. 

PrepanUion. — ^Lentils must be soaked in cold 
water over-night, for some ten hours at least. While 
they are boiling, any that float on top should be re- 
moved. It is best to pass them through a sieve, to 
make sure of their being thoroughly pulped. Season- 
ing and flavouring are of much importance. 

180. LENTILS CURRIED, No. 1 

Take half a pound of lentils ; soak them in cold 
water for three hours, then boil them slowly till 
tender, but not mashed. Heat two ounces of 
dripping in a stewpan to boiling-point ; add one 
onk>n, finely minoed, one teaspoonful each of salt and 
mustard, and one saltspoouhil of pepper. Drain

the lentils as dry as possible ; mix them in thoroughly 
with the other ingredients, and after stirring a few 
minutes to get well blended, serve in a hot dish. 

181. LENTILS CURRIED, No. 2 

Fry four onions cut in slices in a saucepan ; add 
one pint of water or stock, and half a pint of soaked 
red lentils. Thicken with one dessertspoonful of 
curry-powder and one of flour. Simmer for two 
hours, squeeze the juice of half a lemon over the 
lentils, and serve very hot. 

182. LENTILS POTTED 

Take about half a pound of lentils, rather more 
than less. Simmer them in a muslin bag until 
tender, in stock or water. When they are soft, 
beat them to a pulp in a basin, or pulp them through 
a sieve ; and while they are hot, add one table- 
spoonful of butter, half a teaspoonf ul of powdered 
or finely chopped sage, a piled tablespoonful of fine 
breadcrumbs, salt and pepper. Mix thoroughly 
well and bake slowly for about an hour in a buttered 
pie-dish. Keep the water for stock. 

183. LENTIL PUDDING 

Soak, boil, and mash one quart of lentils ; add 
one ounce of butter, salt, pepper, and as much 
milk as will make it the right consistency. Tie in 
a fioured cloth, and boil for an hour and a half. 

Note, — If any of this pudding remains when cold, 
it can be cut into thick slices and fried. 

184. LENTILS STEWED (SPANISH) 

Soak one quart of lentils in cold water all night. 
Boil them next day in plenty of salted water for 
three hours. Drain them well; rub a saucepan 



Digitized by VnOOQ IC 



COOKED PLAINLY OR ELABORATELY 93 

with a clove of garlic ; add one ounce of butter, 
an onion, parsley and herbs minced fine, pepper, 
salt, and the lentils. Stir, and shake well. In a 
quarter of an hour dish up, and serve very hot. 



LETTUCES 

Note. — Of these wholesome and pleasant veget- 
ables there are two varieties, the cabbage lettuce 
and the cos lettuce (which is called romaine in the 
U.S. A.). Although chiefly used uncooked in salads, 
lettuces can be cooked in various ways with much 
success, and the stalks of cos lettuces can be treated 
as asparagus or couve tronchuda (which see). 

PreparcUion. — Careful washing is necessary, and 
the removal of any discoloured outer leaves ; but for 
culinary purposes, more of the large outside leaves 
can be used — they are often rather tough for salad. 

185. LETTUCES BOILED 

Wash and boil them in boiling water, with a 
little salt, until tender ; strain them in a colander, 
and chop them up ; then put them into a saucepan 
with some fresh butter, a spoonful of flour, a little 
nutmeg, salt, and the juice of a lemon ; let the 
whole boil for a quarter of an hour. This may be 
varied by omitting the lemon-juice, adding some 
good cream, and thickening with the yolks of two 
eggs. (This is an excellent plan where lettuces are 
** bolted " and not suitable for serving uncooked. 
Ed.) 

186. LETTUCES CREAMED 

Take three large, sound, cabbage lettuces, wash 
and trim them, and throw into fast-boiling salted 
water for ten minutes. Remove and place in cold 
water for a minute or two ; rinse and dry well ;

94 MAY BYRON'S VEGETABLE BOOK 

out each into quarters, and put them in a saucepan 
with one tablespoonful of butter, and seasoning of 
pepper and salt, and one saltspoonful of castor sugar. 
Let simmer very slowly for two and a half to three 
hours, stirring often, until the lettuces are quite 
tender ; then add two yolks beaten up with about 
half a gill of cream or new milk ; let simmer but not 
boil, and serve very hot, with garnishing of fried 
crofttons. 



187. LETTUCES STUFFED 

Choose some large cabbage lettuces, and, having 
boiled them a quarter of an hour, dip them into cold 
water and let them drain ; then open the leaves 
without breaking them, and fill the centre part with 
a good forcemeat, and tie them up ; stew them for 
a short time, then drain them on a cloth, dip them 
in a batter, and fry to a good colour. When done, 
cover them with breadcrumbs, and serve with some 
white sauce. 



MERCURY, OR GOOD KING HENRY 

Note. — ^This good old-fashioned plant, also known 
as Lincolnshire asparagus, fat hen, blite, shoe- 
maker's heels, etc., is an aboriginal inhabitant of 
Britain. It is so cheap and wholesome, so simple 
and easy to cultivate and to cook, that I suppose 
we neglect it as too cheap. It makes an excellent 
substitute for spinach, if allowed to grow large ; 
or, if the young shoots are cut and boiled in bunches, 
it has a distant resemblance to asparagus. In any 
case, mercury is by no means to be despised, and 
I commend it as a useful spring vegetable, though 
not of the first class.

COOKED PLAINLY OR ELABORATELY 96 

Preparation : — ^As for Bpinach, or as for asparagas 
(which see). 

188. GOOD KING HENRY (BOILED LEAVES) 

Have the leaves well washed, put into a stewpan 
with the smallest possible amount of boiling water, 
and let boil for fifteen minutes ; then add a little 
salt, and boil five minutes longer. Strain off the 
water and chop the leaves finely. Have ready 
hot in a stewpan about one ounce each of butter 
and flour, with a little pepper and salt, add the 
leaves, mix well, and heat thoroughly for another 
five minutes. Serve hot, with garnish of fried 
sippets. 

189. GOOD KING HENRY (BOILED SHOOTS 

AND STALKS) 

Prepare and cook as asparagus (which see), and 
serve with any sauce suitable to asparagus. Keep 
any cold, cooked stalks for salad. 



MUSHROOMS 

Note. — ^Properly speaking, these can hardly be 
termed vegetables, except in so far as they are 
neither animal nor mineral. On the C!ontinent, a 
very large variety of mushrooms are recognised as 
edible ; in Great Britain, although possessing 
thirty edible species, we only make use of two. 
These are the common meadow mushroom {Agaricus 
eampesiris) and the horse mushroom {Agaricus 
arvestris). Hardly anybody dares to experiment 
with the fairy-ring champignon, the chanterelle, 
the blewit, the morel ; with the St. George's mush- 
room, the English truffle, the giant puffball, and 
other delicious esculents. 

However, a sinister suggestion of poison lurks 



Digitized by VnOOQ IC 



96 MAY BYRON'S VEGETABLE BOOK 

within the rosy gills of even the meadow mushroom, 
when those gills turn black ; and I warn you not to 
make use of any agaric, once its flesh darkens. 
Unless fresh, it may be dangerous. 

Preparation. — Use a silver knife. Remove very 
gingerly the outer skin, and the stalks ; the latter 
should be chopped, rinsed, and simmered in milk 
or water to make sauce. Good mushrooms should 
need no trimming, nor should they break under 
the hand. 

As a separate dish, as a garnish, as a flavouring, 
mushrooms are particularly savoury and attractive. 

190. MUSHROOMS BAKED, No. 1 

OarefuUy peel the mushrooms, and put them, 
hollow-side uppermost, on a buttered bakingnsheet ; 
flu the cavities with butter, and set in a moderately 
hot oven. They should be ready in about twelve 
minutes. It will be seen that they must be fairly 
whole mushrooms, not stale or broken ones. 

191. MUSHROOMS BAKED, No. 2 

Place in a pie-dish some good, medium-sized mush- 
rooms, underside up, and place on each a little 
butter, salt, and pepper. Cover them closely with 
another dish of the same size, and set them in a 
moderate oven for ten to fifteen minutes. 



192. MUSHROOMS BROILED, No. 1 

Take some sound, large mushrooms, peel and trim, 
place on a gridiron over sharp heat, and broil for two 
minutes on each side. Place on a hot dish, season 
with salt and pepper, sprinkle with melted butter, 
and a squeeze of lemon-juice ; serve on buttered 
toast.

193. MUSHROOMS BROILED, No. 2 

Cut off tails, peel, wash, and drain well a pound 
of fresh mushrooms. Place in a bowl with a table- 
spoonful of oil, juice of half a sound lemon, a tea- 
spoonful of salt, and half a teaspoonful of pepper. 
Turn well in seasoning ; arrange on a double broiler, 
broil for four minutes on each side, dress on six 
freshly prepared toasts, spread a tablespoonful of 
mattre d'hdtel butter over them, and serve. 



194. MUSHROOMS WITH BUTTER 

Cut away the end of stems of a pound of white 
sound, fresh mushrooms; peel, wash, and drain 
well on a cloth. Heat an ounce of butter in a frying- 
pan ; add the mushrooms ; season with a half- 
teaspoonf ul of salt and two saltspoonfuls of pepper ; 
gently toss them, cover, and fry for ten minutes, 
tossing them once in a while. Have six freshly 
prepared toasts on a hot dish, and evenly divide the 
mushrooms over. Squeeze the juice of quarter of a 
lemon into the pan ; lightly mix and pour over the 
mushrooms ; sprinkle a little chopped parsley over, 
and serve. 



195. MUSHROOMS (FAIRY-RING) CHAMPIGNONS 

Champignons can be stewed by being placed in a 
saucepan, with enough milk to keep them from 
burning, and a little piece of butter, salt, and 
pepper. Stir the contents, and shake the sauce- 
pan frequently. Time, about three-quarters of an 
hoiur. 

They are very nice fried with bacon, or put into 
a stew or hash. They can be dried for winter use.

196. MUSHROOM CROtfTONS 

Take some middle-sized mushrooms, peel and 
trim them, fry them gently in a little butter. Place 
each on a small piece of toast, sprinkle with salt 
and pepper, and keep hot. Have a paste made 
with one ounce of butter, two teaspoonfuls of finely 
minced parsley, and half a teaspoonful of lemon-juice, 
all worked quite smooth. Put a piece of this into 
the middle of each mushroom, and serve very hot. 

197. MUSHROOMS CURRIED 

Take about a dozen good-sized mushrooms for 
this. Pry a small, sliced onion pale brown, using 
about one ounce of butter ; mix in one teaspoonful 
of flour and two teaspoonfuls each of curry-paste and 
curry-powder. Continue to fry lightly for five 
minutes longer ; then add one teaspoonful of 
chutney, one saltspoonful of salt, and about one 
pint of stock. Let all cook quietly for about fifteen 
minutes ; then strain the liquor off, return to the 
pan, put in the mushrooms, and simmer them 
quickly for about half an hour. Serve them inside 
a wall of boiled rice, like a meat curry. 

198. MUSHROOMS AU GRATIN, No. 1 

Clip a little off the tips of stalks of a pound of 
very white, even-sized, medium fresh mushrooms. 
Thoroughly wash them in plenty of cold water, 
and well dry them on a cloth. Heat one ounce 
of butter in a small frying-pan; add the mush- 
rooms, season with a teaspoonful of salt and 
three saltspoonfuls of white pepper, and gently 
brown ten minutes, lightly tossing meanwhile. 
Lift up the mushrooms with a skimmer and keep 
on a plate. Add one ounce and a half of flour to 
the mushrooms and butter in pan ; briskly stir while

heating one minute, pour in one gill of hot milk, 
two tablespoonfuls of sherry, one gill of cream, half 
a saltspoonful of cayenne, and one saltspoonful of 
grated nutmeg. Sharply mix with a whisk until 
it comes to a boil ; add the mushrooms, and slowly 
cook ten minutes, occasionally mixing meanwhile. 
Transfer to a baking-dish, dredge a tablespoonful of 
grated Parmesan cheese over, place a few little bits 
of butter on top, and set to bake in the oven for 
ten minutes ; remove, and serve. 

199. MUSHROOMS AU GRATIN, No. 2 

Take eight or ten large cup mushrooms. Cut off 
all the stalks and peel them, and also peel very 
carefully the cup-like part of the mushroom, so as 
not to hurt the rim. Next scoop out the inside of 
these cups, and chop it up with the stalk of the 
mushrooms. Take a piece of shallot about as big 
as a large nut, a teaspoonful of chopped parsley, 
and a very little chopped thyme, with a little cayenne 
pepper ; add about three ounces of streaky bacon, 
fat and lean. Put all over the fire, and fry for a 
time. If the mass is too dry, it shows there is not 
enough bacon-fat ; if it be too moist, add bread- 
crumbs. Fill the cups of the mushrooms with this 
mixture, and shake over some fine breckd-raspings. 
Place the cups so prepared in a covered stewpan, 
with some butter or oil, and let them cook very gently 
till the cup part of the mushroom is quite tender. 
Serve hot, with toast, either plain or with some rich 
brown gravy poured round them. 

200. MUSHROOM OMELET 

Peel and stalk some sound, medium-sized mush- 
rooms. Fry them lightly in a little butter, seasoned 
with pepper and salt. Whisk three eggs, yolks and 
whites separately ; then blend them^ and add a little

100 MAY BYRON'S VEGETABLE BOOK 

pepper and salt. Pour the eggs into a buttered 
omelet pan ; when they set, place the mushrooms in 
them, and fold over like an ordinary omelet. Serve 
at once on a very hot dish. 

201. MUSHROOMS SCALLOPED, No. 1 

Take a medium-sized pie-dish ; butter it, sprinkle 
the bottom thickly with fine breadcrumbs; strew 
little bits of butter over, and moisten very slightly 
with milk. Have ready some sound mushrooms, 
peeled and trimmed ; put a layer of these and one of 
crumbs and butter, alternately, till the dish is 
full. The top layer must be crumbs, with an extra 
allowance of butter. Pour a pint of milk over the 
whole, and place in a good oven for one hour. 

202. MUSHROOMS SCALLOPED. No. 2 

Put the mushrooms into a saucepan with fresh 
butter, chopped parsley, shallots, and a few chopped 
mushrooms ; moisten them from time to time 
with a little butter and water, mixed with flour, 
and stew them gently for about half an hour ; then 
put into shells or a dish, covered with crumbs 
of bread. Put them over a red fire for a short 
time, and brown in the oven. 

203. MUSHROOMS STEWED, No. 1 

Peel and trim one pint of good, small mushrooms. 
Place them in a bowl of cold water, and squeeze in a 
little lemon-juice. Leave them there ten minutes or 
BO, then lift them out separately with a skimmer, and 
put them in a shallow stewpan, adding three ounces 
of pepper, the rest of the lemon-juice, and seasoning 
of salt and pepper. Put the lid on, and stew the 
mushrooms twenty minutes or so; then make a 
thickening with a quarter of a pint of milk, one tea-

spoonful of butter, half a saltspoonful of grated nut- 
meg, and add to the liquor in the stew. Mix well, 
let 8tew five minutes more, and serve hot with sippets 
of toast or fried bread. 

204. MUSHROOMS STEWED, No. 2 

Look carefully over each mushroom by breaking 
it in half, to ascertain if it be worm-eaten ; if so, 
reject it. No fungus is more poisonous than an 
old worm-eaten mushroom. Having ascertained 
that they are sound, wash them in strong salt and 
water ; dry and wipe them, and place them in a 
saucepan with one ounce of butter (or more, in 
accordance with the quantity of mushrooms), some 
milk, pepper, and salt. Simmer slowly or bake in 
a covered jar for one hour. Look at them fre- 
quently, and add more milk if necessary. Have 
ready some hot fried toast, lay the mushrooms on 
the toast, and serve very hot. 

205. MUSHROOMS STUFFED 

Remove the stalks (and keep them) from one 
pound of very fresh, good-sized, sound mushrooms ; 
wash in cold water, and carefully drain on a cloth. 
Heat one tablespoonf ul of melted butter in a frying- 
pan; place the mushrooms in a pan one beside 
another, and cook for three minutes on each side. 
Squeeze over juice of half a sound lemon, sprinkle 
over half a teaspoonful of salt, toss well, and keep 
on a plate till required. Thoroughly wash the 
mushroom stalks, chop very fine, place in a small 
saucepan with one ounce of butter, three finely 
chopped shallots, one oimce of chopped raw ham, 
and gently brown for ten minutes, frequently 
stirring meanwhile ; add one tablespoonful of flour ; 
stir well, pour in a gill of cream, three saltspoonfuls 
of salt, one saltspoonful of cayenne pepper, and one

102 MAY BYRON'S VEGETABLE BOOK 

saltspoonful of grated nutmeg ; mix with wooden 
spoon until it comes to a boil ; then add two table- 
spoonfuls of fresh breadcrumbs, one egg yolk, and 
mix well while heating for three minutes. Transfer 
this preparation to a plate, and let it get cold ; then 
stuff mushrooms with the preparation, neatly smooth 
tops, carefully dip in melted butter, then in bread- 
crumbs ; place on a tin, set in oven for eight minutes ; 
remove, and serve. 

NASTURTIUMS (TROPiEOLUMS) 

Note. — ^Three kinds of nasturtiums are used as 
vegetables : the climbing Tropceolum nuijus, the 
dwarf T. minus, and the half-hardy and very 
beautiful T. tvberoaua, with its slender red-and- 
yellow flowers. The great merit of ma jus and minus 
is that they will grow pretty nearly anywhere, and 
seem almost to enjoy poor soil. When one considers, 
too, that they are naturally Peruvian plants, it is 
extraordinary with how little sun they can subsist. 
The green leaves can be treated as a cooked veget- 
able ; the tips of the shoots and the green seeds can 
be added to salads ; and the green seeds, pickled in 
vinegar, make an effective substitute for capers. 

T. tuberosushB,^ small, curious, potato-like tubers, 
which are edible, but not certain to be appreciated, 
unless you have become acclimatised to the taste 
for them by habitation in South America. 

Preparation. — Leaves, a^ for spinach; tubers, 
probably as for new potatoes. 

See Salads, Chap. VIII. 

NETTLES 

Note. — ^These despised " weeds " are of excellent 
worth, both for making nettle beer or for using as a 
culinary vegetable. As nothing can possibly be 



Digitized by VnOOQ IC 



COOKED PLAINLY OR ELABORATELY 103 

cheaper, nor more wholesome, it is advisable to 
avail oneself of nettles ; but please note that you 
can only eat the young and tender shoots, lliey 
must never be gathered after the nettle has flowered. 
Preparation. — ^The young shoots must be washed, 
dried in a cloth, and ti^ in trim bundles like 
asparagus. Use several waters in the washing. 

206. NETTLES BOILED 

Young nettle sprouts, about six inches high, are 
not only invaluable for that wholesome beverage 
nettle beer, they can be advantageously utilised 
as a vegetable. Wash them well, put them in fast- 
boiling, salted water, and cook about fifteen minutes. 
Drain off the water, leaving the nettles as dry as 
possible ; work in one ounce of butter, and seasoning 
of salt and pepper, keeping the pan over the fire. 
Have ready some buttered toast, and serve the 
nettles on this, placing poached eggs on the top. 

207. NETTLES STEAMED 

Prepare as above, and cook in a steamer until 
tender, say about twenty minutes. Drain and 
untie, arrange neatly on a hot dish or on buttered 
toast ; sprinkle with salt and pepper, and serve with 
a simple sauce, such as beurre fondu. 

208. NETTLES AU GRATIN 

Wash, dry, and string some young nettle shoots. 
Put them into cold water, salted a little, and let 
this come to boiling-point ; then strain off the water, 
but do not press the leaves too hard so as to break 
them. Butter a pie-dish, sprinkle it with fine bread- 
crumbs, grated cheese, and seasoning of pepper and 
salt. Place the nettles on this, and cover them with a 
similar layer ; strew small pieces of butter over, 



Digitized by VnOOQ IC 



104 MAY BYRON'S VEGETABLE BOOK 

and put into a moderate oven for about a quarter 
of an hour. 

209. NETTLES STEWED 

Take some young nettle-shoots ; wash, dry, and 
chop them very small. Place in a stewpan with 
one small finely chopped onion, half a teaspoonful 
of castor sugar, and seasoning of salt and pepper ; 
add sufficient stock (or water, if no stock be avail- 
able) just barely to cover the nettles ; more can be 
added if this boils away. Put at the side of the fire, 
and let stew very gradually till tender ; then add 
a thickening of butter, flour, and cream, or milk, and 
carefully mix it in. Serve on buttered toast, and 
put rings of hard-boiled egg on top. 



ONIONS 

Note. — ^These rank among the oldest vegetables 
in the world. Almost magical healing properties 
have been ascribed, in aU ages and countries, 
to these pungent bulbs. They were considered 
actually sacred in ancient Egj^t. They are 
of the same family as lilies ; which shows how 
much kinsfolk may differ. Onions are exceedingly 
wholesome, nutritious, and appetising if thoroughly 
cooked ; an underdone or raw onion is only 
digestible by a strong, outdoor personage. The 
young spring onion, known as "gippo" in the 
West country, is an excellent addition to salads, but 
almost impossible to forget once you have eaten 
it. The large Spanish onion is the least pertinacious 
as regards its lingering taste and odour. Probably 
onions boiled are the safest; fried, the most in- 
digestible ; and baked, the tastiest. 

Their extraordinary effect upon the lachrymal 
glands woxdd suggest an equally powerful effect 



Digitized by VnOOQ IC 



COOKED PLAINLY OR ELABORATELY 106 

upon the internal organs. They have this great 
advantage, that being neither roots, tubers, nor in 
any sense farinaceous, they are not taboo for gouty, 
rheumatic, or diabetic people. 

It is advisable to peel onions in a draught, 
or close to the fire, to dispel some of their powerful 
aroma. 

Preparation. — Remove the stalk, close against the 
bulb, and take off one or two of the outer skins, till 
you approach green skin. Place them at once in cold 
water, slightly salted, and let it come to boiling- 
point ; strain it off, and place the onions in another 
pan of salted, boiling water (if it be boiled), or pro- 
ceed with any other selected process. By the above 
means you will ensure their being not only blanched, 
but well cooked. 



210. ONIONS BAKED, No. 1 

Peel three medium, sound Spanish onions, clip off 
a small piece at both ends, cut in two, crosswise, 
and arrange in a baking-dish cut side up. Mix in a 
bowl an oimce of butter, a teaspoonful of chopped 
parsley, a saltspoonful each of salt and pepper, and 
the juice of half a sound lemon. Spread this mixture 
evenly over the six half-onions, cover with a 
buttered paper, and set in oven for thirty-five 
minutes, being careful to baste quite frequently. 
Bring dish to oven door, and lift up paper ; sprinkle 
over two tablespoonfuls of fresh breadcrumbs, baste 
well ; reset in oven for ten minutes more ; remove, 
and serve in same dish. 

211. ONIONS BAKED, No. 2 

Take four or five middle-sized Spanish onions, 
and put them in a pan, without peeling them, in 
cold water that will just cover them. Let simmer

106 MAY BYRON'S VEGETABLE BOOK 

slowly over the fire for two hours ; then remoTe, 
drain, and take off the skins. Put them in a large 
pie-dish, and season each onion with salt and pepper. 
Place a large piece of butter on the top of each, 
dredge thickly with fine breadcrumbs, and bake in 
a sharp oven to a deep golden brown. They are 
better served in the same dish ; a fire-proof one is 
advisable, as it looks best, besides keeping hotter. 

212. ONIONS BAKED, No. 3 

Put four or five Spanish onions, with their skins 
on, in a saucepan of salted water; let them boil 
quickly for one hour. Then take them out, dry 
them thoroughly, wrap each one separately in a piece 
of buttered paper (or a paper bag), and bake them 
in a moderate oven for two hours or longer. Remove 
the paper and serve the onions in their skins. 

213. ONIONS BAKED, No. 4 

Put some onions in a deep pie-dish (after removing 
the outside skins), salt and pepper them, and place 
a piece of butter on each onion ; cover them over, 
and place them in a hot oven for about three hours 
and a half. 

214. ONIONS BOILED, No. 1 

Unless the onions be very mild or young, when 
boiling change the water two or three times, re- 
plenishing each time with cold water and draining 
when the boiling-point is reached. CJook until very 
tender. Drain and serve with butter or cream or a 
white sauce. Onions left over may be cut in thin 
slices and disposed in a buttered gratin dish in 
layers with white sauce, then covered with buttered 
crumbs, and set in the oven, to reheat and brown 
the crumbs. Onion pur6e is particularly good with 
mutton chops.

216 ONIONS BOILED, No. 2 

Take three or four good Spanish onions, peel them, 
and put them to soak in cold, salted water for two 
hours ; drain them and place in a deep saucepan ; 
cover them with enough milk to prevent their being 
seen. Place the pan over a gentle heat, keep the 
lid on, and let simmer slowly for about three hours. 
Serve hot in a deep dish or tureen, with butter, salt, 
pepper, and a teaspoonful of minced parsley. 



216. ONIONS CREAMED 

Take two pounds of middle-sized onions, peel 
them, and put into a pan, with one teaspoonful of 
white sugar, and just cover them with boiling water. 
Let them boil till nearly tender ; then put in one 
teaspoonful of salt, and let them boil till done. 
Drain off the liquor. Have ready a sauce as follows : 
mix one tablespoonful of flour into one ounce of 
melted butter ; when this has heated for two 
minutes, stir in half a pint of hot milk, and heat for 
two minutes more ; add salt and pepper to taste ; 
stir well, and pour it over the onions in a hot veget- 
able dish. 



217. ONIONS AU GRATIN, No. 1 

Take one pound of Spanish onions, boil soft, and 
mince small. Have ready two ounces of grated 
cheese. Take a buttered baking-dish, cover the 
bottom with onion, then put in layer of grated cheese, 
and pepper and salt to taste. Repeat in alternate 
layers till the dish is full. The top layer must be 
cheese, which should be sprinkled with butter or 
dripping, dusted with breadcrumbs or flour, and set 
in a good oven for ten minutes.

218. ONIONS AU GRATIN, No. 2 

Take four good-sized Spanish onions, and blanch 
them in boiling, salted water for ten minutes. Drain 
and cut them up ; put them in a stewpan with just 
enough milk to float them. Simmer over a low fire 
till tender ; then drain all mixture through a sieve. 
Use the liquid thus obtained to make a sauce, with 
two ounces of butter and half an ounce of flour, 
mixed smooth into one tablespoonful of milk, one 
yolk, pepper and salt. Put the onions into a hot 
buttered dish ; mix the sauce well in, strew a layer 
of grated cheese over, and a little butter (melted) on 
top. Bake a few minutes until coloured. 

219. ONION S0UFFL6 

Melt one tablespoonful of butter in a saucepan, 
and add one tablespoonful of flour, quarter of a tea- 
spoonful of salt, and a dash of paprika. When 
smoothly mixed, add one cup of milk. When the 
sauce boils, add half a cup of stale breadcrumbs 
(from centre of loaf), a teaspoonful of chopped 
parsley, one cup of cold, boiled onions, chopped fine, 
and the yolk of an egg well-beaten. Beat the 
whites of two eggs very stiff, and fold them into the 
onion mixture. Bake in a buttered pudding-dish, 
in a moderate oven, about fifteen minutes. Serve 
at once, with or without cream sauce. 

220. ONIONS STEWED 

Take two large Spanish onions, roll them in a 
little flour, and fry them whole in a stewpan with 
as little dripping as possible. When they are a light 
brown, add half a teaspoonful of Liebig's Extract or 
Bovril, dissolved in one breakfastcupful of hot water. 
Let all come to boiling-point, then cover the pan and 
Btew slowly for two hours or so. The liquor must 
be thickened with a little flour.

221. ONIONS STUFFED, No. 1 

Take some medium-sized Spanish onions, scoop 
out their centres, and let them boil ten minutes ; 
then drain, and stuff with the following mixture : 
eight ounces of sausage meat, and seasoning of salt 
and pepper, half a saltspoonful each of grated 
nutmeg and powdered thyme. The onions will 
probably need binding. Place them in a shallow 
stewpan, with one small carrot thinly sliced, and 
the Bcooped-out centres finely chopped ; add half a 
pint of stock, and cover the pan with lid. Let the 
onions stew very gently for about one hour, and 
look occasionally to see tf the liquor has boiled away, 
when it can be replaced with the same amount of 
boiling water. When the onions are a good brown 
and quite tender, put them in a hot vegetable-dish, 
strain and thicken the gravy, and pour it over them. 

222. ONIONS STUFFED, No- 2 

Parboil three large Spanish onions, take out the 
centres, and fill up with the following mixture : 
a quarter of a pound of finely chopped cold meat, 
one ounce and a half of grated cheese, the scraps of 
onion, chopped, and a seasoning of pepper and salt. 
Place a small lump of butter on the top of each, and 
fry or bake the onions in hot fat. Serve very hot, 
with a thick gravy. 

223. ONIONS STUFFED, No. 3 

Cook ten or twelve onions in salted water, changing 
the water twice (about an hour, or until nearly 
tender) ; drain and cool; Take out the centre of 
each onion without disturbing the outside layers ; 
to this add six mushrooms, saut6 five minutes in 
butter ; chop fine, €wid half a cup of breadcrumbs, 
and cream or white sauce to mix ; season with salt 
and pepper, add a little butter, and fill the open space

in the onions with the mixture. Put in a buttered 
baking-dish, sprinkle the top with three-quarters of a 
cup of fine dry crumbs, stirred into quarter of a cup 
of melted butter, and bake about twenty minutes, 
basting carefully with a little butter and hot water. 
The onions may also be stuffed with pork sausage. 
Thus stuffed, they become an appropriate garnish for 
roast turkey or spare-rib of pork. 



PARSNIPS 

Note. — ^The parsnip is a native British plant, butits 
use as a cultivated vegetable in Britain is only some 
four hundred years old, although it was a familiar 
viand in Roman households. Parsnips stand third in 
dietetic value among culinary vegetables, but, owing 
to the sugar they contain, must be barred by gouty 
and rheumatic persons. They require to be sup- 
plemented by a rich sauce, or plenty of oleaginous 
matter, for, according to the familiar old adage, 
" Fine words butter no parsnips." To many people's 
thinking, they are better boiled, and then frie^, 
than any other way. A remarkably potent and 
pungent wine is made by cottagers from parsnips. 

Preparation. — Parsnips should not be cut before 
being cooked, or they will deteriorate by at least 
half their value. Choose, therefore, small or 
medium-sized ones, as even in size as possible. 
Scrub them thoroughly in cold water, and either 
steam them, or place in boiling, salted water, as little 
of it as possible, and let them boil fast till tender, 
which should be about one hour and twenty minutes. 
Serve them whole. 

224. PARSNIPS BOILED, No. 1 

Take two pounds of parsnips ; wash and scrape 
well ; cut any larger ones in pieces^ so that all shall

a lemon and a teaspoonful of salt. Cover pan, let 
gently boil for forty-five minutes ; drain, then place 
in a deep dish. Squeeze over them the juice of half a 
lemon, adding a teaspoonful of chopped parsley, half 
a teaspoonful of salt, two saltspoonfuls of pepper,

PEAS 

Note. — ^Peas have been cultivated so long in 
Europe, that they are found in the remains of 
Bronze Age dwellings. Whether eaten green or 
dried, their value has never been in any doubt. In 
the former condition they are more appetising ; in 
the latter, more nutritious. The great Leguminous 
family, which includes beans, peas, lentils, etc., etc., 
is perhaps the most varied tribe in the world. It 
contains about 6,500 species ; its members exist in 
all parts of the known world, except in St. Helena 
and one other small island. They range in size 
from tiny insignificant herbs to great trees whose 
trunks have a girth of 80 feet. Peas, beans, and 
lentils, already named, supply enormous quantities 
of human food ; cloves, vetches, and lucernes, pro- 
vide endless fodder for cattle; senna, liquorice, 
tolu balsam, tamarinds, catechu, gum Arabic, manna, 
indigo, rosewood, logwood are included ; with an 
immense variety of other useful growths, and 
ornamental ones including furze, broom, mimosa, 
sensitive plant, and the greenweed or planta 
genista from which our Angevin kings derived 
their surname. 

All this may or may not be relevant to a cook- 
book ; but it is undoubtedly very interesting. 

Preparation. — (1) If you are fortunate enough to 
have your own young green peas, freshly picked from 
your own garden, shell them, and place them in a 
shallow stewpan, in fast-boiling salted water (one 
teaspoonful of salt to one pint of water), barely 
sufficient to cover them. Don't put in sugar, or 
soda, or mint, or parsley, or butter, or anything. 
Keep the pan-lid off, and let the peas boil fast till 
they are tender, about ten minutes ; then drain and 
serve in a heated dish.

But this is a counsel of perfection as to the best 
way of dealing with the best peas. 

(2) For second-best peas — ^which include all those 
which have been bought, and whose freshness you 
cannot guarantee — you may add two or three leaves 
of mint, a small spray of parsley, a lump of sugar, 
an ounce of butter, a small onion or a few chives ; 
but be careful to use as little water as possible. 
These peas will, of course, take longer to cook. 

(3) Old peas are most eatable when "jugged," 
in a tightly stoppered jar set in boiling water. 
Butter, pepper, salt, and ^ugar should be added 
to them, but no water. They will take at least 
forty-five minutes. 

(4) Dried peas must be well picked and washed, 
and soaked in cold water for eight hours, or over- 
night, before you attempt to cook them. Dried 
green peas are more palatable than yellow split 
ones. 

(5) Pea-pods, when very young, may be boiled 
whole as directed in the first instance. When 
older, they can be " topped and tailed *' and sliced 
on the slant, like French beans, and boiled a good 
while in a minimum of water. In this way, also, 
you secure a good basis for green or vegetable soup. 



233. PEAS (AVIGNONNAISE) 

Place a pint of fresh, tender, shelled peas in a 
saucepan with a quart of boiling water, a teaspoonf ul 
of salt, half a teaspoonful of sugar, two saltspoon- 
fuls of pepper, and a teaspoonful of butter. Cover 
pan, boil forty minutes, thoroughly drain on a sieve ; 
heat a teaspoonful of melted butter in a frying-pan, 
add two ounces of very finely chopped cooked ham, 
and gently brown five minutes, frequently stirring 
meanwhile ; add peas, with half a teaspoonful of 
chopped chives, a teaspoonful of French mustard. 



Digitized by VnOOQ IC 



COOKED PLAINLY OR ELABORATELY 116 

one ounce of butter, three saltspoonfuls of salt, 
a saltspoonful of white pepper, and sprinkle over 
a teaspoonful of flour ; lightly toss on fire while cook- 
ing three minutes. Remove and use as required. 



234. PEAS BOILED 

If the pods are clean and fresh, cook part of them, 
with water to cover, half an hour. Strain the water 
through a cheese cloth, reheat, and use as the Uquid 
in which to cook the peas. Freshly gathered tender 
peas should cook in twenty minutes. In cooking 
peas, use no more liquid than it takes to cover them ; 
season with salt, pepper, and butter. Cream, broth, 
or meat extract may be added. A little sugar is 
sometimes an improvement. Cubes of carrots, 
cooked separately, also may be added to a dish of 
peas. Peas alone, or combined with carrots, turnips, 
and potatoes, are also served in cream sauce or in a 
curry sauce. 



236. PEAS WITH BUTTER 

Place a pint of fresh, tender, yoimg, shelled peas 
in a saucepan with a white onion having two cloves 
stuck in it, one small head well-washed green lettuce, 
three pints of water, a teaspoonful of salt, a tea- 
spoonful of sugar, half a teaspoonful of white pepper, 
and half an ounce of good butter. Cover the pan 
and gently boil for one hour; drain on a sieve, remove 
the lettuce and onion, and replace the peas in pan. 
Knead on a saucer half an ounce of butter with a 
teaspoonful of flour ; add to the peas with two salt- 
spoonfuls of sugar and two saltspoonfuls of white 
pepper. Mix well on the fire with a wooden spoon 
for two minutes, dress on a vegetable dish, and serve.

236. PEA CROQUETTES 

Take three teacupfuls of green peas; put them 
into fast-boiling water, cook till tender ; then pulp 
them through a sieve, and add one teacupful each of 
breadcrumbs and of minced ham, one tablespoonful 
each of minced chives and of lemon-thyme finely 
chopped, and about one ounce of butter, and season- 
ing of salt and pepper. Mix well, shape into cro- 
quettes, cover with egg and breadcrumbs, and fry 
in boiling fat. 



237. PEAS CURRIED 

Soak one pound of split peas in one quart of cold 
water, overnight, adding a level saltspoonful of 
bicarbonate of soda; then put them in a deep 
saucepan, in the same water, and, when they boil, 
let them simmer gently till tender, about one hour 
and a half. Meanwhile, have ready in a small sauce- 
pan an onion and an apple, about medium-size, 
minced small, one ounce of butter, a teaspoonful of 
curry-powder, and half a breakfastcupful of water. 
Let this stew gently for an hour ; it must be often 
stirred, and covered closely. When the peas are 
done, strain the water from them into the smaller 
pan ; use a little flour to thicken it, and season with 
salt ; boil it up, and pour it over the peas in a hot 
dish. 



23S. PEAS (FLEMISH METHOD) 

Take about a dozen young spring onions; chop 
them and fry them a nice brown in a tablespoonful

season with a little salt and pepper, and let all just 
boil ; then drain and dish up.

239. PEAS JUGGED 

This is one of the best ways to cook peas, whether 
fresh, dried green, tinned or bottled. Shell a pint 
of peas, put them into a clean two-pound pickle 
bottle or any jar with a closely fitting top, adding a 
tablespoonful of butter, a teaspoonful of powdered 
sugar, a saltspoonful of salt, a dozen mint leaves, 
and, at discretion, a very little black pepper. 
Cover the vessel tightly, and immerse it, to the extent 
of half its depth, in a pan of boiling water. Set the 
latter on the fire and boil briskly. Examine in half 
an hour. The peas, if very young, should be done by 
then ; if old, they will of course take longer. 

240. PEAS WITH LETTUCE, No. 1 

Shell a quart of young, tender green peas ; plunge 
them into a quart of boiling water with a teaspoonful 
of salt, and boil for twenty minutes. Drain on a 
sieve. Finely chop a medium white onion, and 
lightly brown in a small saucepan with one ounce of 
butter ; then add the white part of a small head of 
sound lettuce very finely chopped up. Mix well 
with a fork, and cook for two minutes ; then add the 
peas. Season with a level teaspoonful of salt, half 
a teaspoonful of sugar, and two saltspoonfuls of 
white pepper, also sprinkling two teaspoonfuls of 
flour over ; toss well, then add half a gill of cold 
water. Allow to simmer gently for ten minutes, 
occasionally tossing meanwhile. Pour into a deep, 
hot vegetable dish and serve. If green peas are not 
obtainable, a pint of tinned or bottled peas can be 
employed in place of the fresh and cooked the same 
way.

POTATOES 

Note. — ^Nobody regards the potato as romantic, 
and yet it belongs to the most romantic (in a sinister 
sense) of all tribes. It is a member of the great 
Solanacese order, which contains six hundred species ; 
a cousin of the Three Fates of Poison — deadly night- 
shade, henbane, and thorn-apple or stramonium. Its 
very blossoms would tell you this, they are so similar 
to those of the woody nightshade. Solanum tubero- 
sum, the common or garden potato, the most 
valuable food- vegetable in existence, the staple diet 
of millions, stands as a crowning instance of extremes 
meeting. 

The " Potato of Virginia '* was originally intro- 
duced to Britain by one Herriot — blessed be his name I 
— ^though Sir Walter Raleigh, in a vague way, gets 
the credit of it. But Sir Walter's fame is quite great 
enough to let even the potato go. . . . Its name 
is derived, through the Spanish pakUa, from the 
native Red Indian term batata ; and it was not fit 
first recognised as of any special culinary or diete^c 
value. Nearly two hundred years elapsed before it 
rose to its present proud position ; and now» one 
cannot imagine how it can ever be superseded. The 
two vegetables which most nearly approach it in 



Digitized by VnOOQ IC 



CX>OKED PLAINLY OR ELABORATELY 128 

iini>ortanoe, the JeraBalem artichoke and the pars- 
nip, are far behind. Sdanum tuberosum — poisonoiis 
of fruit, and precious of tuber — ^is one of the best 
gifts of the Creator to a world so strangely mixed of 
good and bad. 

I have devoted the largest amount of space to 
potato dishes, because they are not merely alterna- 
tives, or wholesome extras, or valuable for medicinal 
reasons ; they are solid, sensible food — you can live 
on potatoes alone. I don't think one can say this 
of anything else, exc^t plantains or bananas, and, 
of course, wheat. />,^;^*^«^ 

Preparation. — The most valuable ^ammal salts of 
the potato lie closely next the skin ; it is therefore 
utterly wasteful to prepare it in the too frequent 
fashion, by peeling it and letting it lie in cold water. 
The bulk and quantity remain (though even these 
are deteriorated by peeling), but the most essential 
qualities are gone for ever. Potatoes should always 
be boiled (or, far better steamed) in their skins, a 
preliminary cleaning and scrubbing being given. 
The flavour is enhanced, the mineial salts are re- 
tained, and much waste in labour and material is 
avoided. 

The potato is one of the only vegetables (the 
others being Jerusalem artichokes, sweet potatoes, 
and yams), which is placed in cold water and allowed 
to come to boiling-point. With new potatoes, this 
rule is reversed ; they must be rubbed or gently 
scraped until the thin skin comes off, and then placed 
in boiling salted water. Always choose potatoes so 
far as possible of one size. To render potatoes 
mealy (if for some reason you must peel them), 
it is inevitable that you pour off the water when 
they are just cooked, and leave the lid on ajar, so. 
that they shall finish themselves by the process 
of steaming. Very Old potatoes may be peeled, 
and the eyes, with any bruised-looking parts,

124 MAY BYRON'S VEGETABLE BOOK 

removed ; place them in cold salted water, and, when 
it has boiled, let simmer for about twenty minutes. 

Potatoes cooked in their skins should be boiled 
till the skins crack ; then drain off the water, 
cover the potatoes with a clean cloth, and leave the 
pot near the fire for a quarter of an hour or so before 
dishing up. 

New potatoes should be freshly dug if possible ; the 
flavour of a new potato just out of the ground is a 
totally different thing to that of a foreign imported 
one — in fact, I do not consider the latter worth 
eating. Even those English new potatoes which 
have been lying about in market-baskets for a day 
or two are considerably deteriorated. The skins, 
as aforesaid, should be carefully scraped, not peeled 
off. A potato that " will not scrape " is a foreign 
and inferior one. Put the potatoes into salted 
boiling water, with a sprig of mint. When they 
are sufficiently cooked, drain off the water, add 
about a teaspoonful of milk and a piece of butter the 
size of a walnut, shake the pan over the fire till the 
butter is well melted, and mixed with the potatoes. 
Place them xu a hot vegetable dish, and dust with 
pepper and salt. 

264. POTATOES, ANNA, No. 1 

Peel, wash, and drain four good-sized, sound, rayr 
potatoes. Slice them with a potato machine ; or, 
if none is at hand, slice them as fine as possible. 
Grate two ounces of Parmesan or Swiss cheese. 
Heat one ounce of butter in a small frying-pan, 
remove the pan from the fire, and cover the 
bottom with a light layer of potatoes. Mix a tea- 
spoonful of salt with two saltspoonfuls of white 
pepper, sprinkle a very little over the potatoes, and 
place a few little bits of butter over the cheese. 
Arrange another layer of potatoes — and so on till 
all are employed. Cover the pan and place on a

moderate fire for five minntes. Turn them over with 
a cake turner, let them cook again for three minutes, 
and then place in the hot oven for ten minutes. 
Remove them from the oven, turn on a hot dish, 
and serve. 

265. POTATOES, ANNA, No. 2 

Pare 'the potatoes, and cut them lengthwise 
into slices one-fourth an inch in thickness; care- 
fully put the slices together, to retain the original 
shape of the potato, and then run two wooden 
toothpicks, dipped in melted butter, through each 
potato, to hold the pieces together. Parboil ten 
minutes, then bake either with the roast or separ- 
ately, basting with dripping from the roast. Re- 
move the toothpicks ; serve as a garnish to the 
roast. 

266. POTATOES BAKED 

First scrub thoroughly with a vegetable brush, 
then put into a hot oven. Potat^^q of moderate 
size require in baking about forty-live minutes; 
they are at their best as soon as they are soft through- 
out. As the heat is usually strongest from above, 
turn the potatoes, occasionally, to insure even bak- 
ing. On removal from the oven, break the skin 
to let the steam escape, lest the naturally dry, 
mealy potato become " soggy " from the quickly 
condensing steam. A potato baked in a slow oven 
is less digestible than the same when properly boiled. 

267. POTATOES BAKED WITH CHEESE 

Take four large, cold, boiled potatoes, four eggs, 
one pint of cream, three ounces of cheese, salt and 
pepper. Cut the potatoes into thin slices and 
arrange in layers in a buttered dish ; sprinkle each

126 MAY BYRON'S VEGETABLE BOOK 

layer with cheese, salt, and pepper, and pour over a 
little of the eggs, beaten and mixed with the cream« 
Bake about hali an hour. Serve as a luncheon 
dish ; or at a family dinner with boiled ham, or 
broiled beefsteak. 

268. POTATO BALLS WITH BUTTER 

With a French cutter cut out potato balls ; cook 
until tender in boiling salted water; drain, pour 
over them a little melted butter, and sprinkle with 
finely-ohopped parsley. Cook turnips or carrots in 
the same way. 

25d. POTATO BALLS, PERSILLADE 

Boil six middle-sized potatoes in two quarts of 
water with a teaspoonful of salt for thirty minutes. 
Drain well. Press through a potato masher into a 
bowl, add half a teaspoonful of chopped parsley, 
half a teaspoonful of chopped chervil, two egg 
yolks, half an ounce of butter, half a teaspoonful of 
salt, two saltspoonf uls of pepper, and a saltspoonful 
of grated nutmeg. Briskly stir with wooden spoon 
two minutes. Boll out the pur6e on a lightly floured 
table to twelve even balls. Dip in beaten egg, 
lightly roll in breadcrumbs, place in a frying-basket, 
and fry in boiling fat six minutes. Take up, arrange 
on a hot dish with a folded napkin, and serve. 

260. POTATOES A LA BELGE

potatoes and bacon are tend^. 

261. POTATOES, BIGNON 

Neatly wipe six medium, round, sound, unpeeled 
potatoes. Place them on a tin and bake in the oven 
for forty minutes. Remove, cut in halves, scrape 
out the ** meat," and place it in a bowl, keeping the 
shells. Season with a teaspoonful of salt, two salt- 
spoonfuls of white pepper, and a saltspoonful of 
grated nutm^, adding one gill of hot milk, one 
tablespoonful of good butter. Lightly brown for 
two minutes in one teaspoonful of butter, two 
skinned and sliced pork sausages, and six very 
finely chopped shallots, and add it to the potatoes. 
Mix well with a wooden spoon for five minutes, 
then fill up the potato shells with the mixture. 
Place on a tin ; sprinkle a tablespoonful of grated 
Parmesan cheese over them, equally divided. Place 
in a hot oven and bake for ten minutes, or until a 
nice golden colour. Remove, place on a hot dish, 
and serve. 

262. POTATOES, BRIOCHES 

Peel eight medium, sound potatoes ; cook them in 
two quarts of water with a teaspoonful of salt for 
thirty-five minutes. Drain and press through a 
potato masher into a bowl. Season with half a 
teaspoonful of salt, two saltspoonf uls of white pepper, 
one light teaspoonful of grated nutmeg, adding two 
whole raw eggs and half an ounce of butter. Thor- 
oughly mix with the wooden spoon for five minutes. 
Spread two tablespoonfuls of flour on a comer of the 
table. Divide the pur6e into six equal parts. Roll 
them in the flour, giving them a nice brioche form. 
Place in a buttered tin pan, spread a few drops of 
melted butter over each brioche, and bake in the hot

oven until of a nice golden colour, or eight minutes. 
Remove from the oven, dress on a hot dish, and 
serve. 

263. POTATOES BROILED 

Halve lengthwise cold boiled potatoes, white or 
sweet ; salt them lightly, then dip in melted butter, 
turning them so as to cover all sides with the butter ; 
then dispose them on a double-broiler — ^an oyster 
or tomato broiler is admirable for this purpose — and 
broil over a moderate fire, first on one side and then 
on the other, until well browned. Serve on a hot 
dish. 

264. POTATOES BROWNED 

Having boiled six or eight good-sized potatoes 
till just cooked, let them be drained and become cold. 
Cut them into thick slices of even size and shape 
(a pastry cutter will do this best), season them with 
salt and pepper, dredge them with flour, brush the 
upper sides with beaten egg, and brown in a good 
oven on a floured tin. 

265. POTATOES BROWNED WITH CHEESE 

Boil some potatoes in their " jackets," but do not 
let them fall to pieces. Remove peel, and pare 
them till all are the same size. Have a Uttle butter 
melted in a bowl, chip them in this, then roll them 
in grated cheese, seasoned with pepper and salt. 
Put them in a buttered tin in a good oven, and 
when the cheese has coloured, serve " hot and hot.'* 

266. POTATO CASSOLETTES

steam till quite done ; add three beaten yolks and a 
little nutmeg ; stir well over the fire for five minutes ; 
press all through a sieve, and make into a paste about 
one inch and half thick. Let this get quite cold, 
then cut it into rounds with a plain two-inch cutter. 
Dip these in ^g and breadcrumbs (having previously 
marked the top with a smaller cutter), and fry in 
boiling fat. When each is a golden brown, take off 
the top as marked, carefully scoop out most of the 
inside (which can be used otherwise) with a tea- 
spoon handle, and replace it with mince of any sort ; 
put the tops on again, place in the oven for a 
minute, and serve. 

267. POTATOES AND CHEESE 

Cut some cold boiled potatoes in thin slices, 
and lay them in a greased pie-dish ; over them 
lay cheese cut thin, a little butter and unmade 
mustard, then more potatoes, and so on until the 
dish is full. Pour over all one pint of milk, and 
bake in a quick oven for one hour. 

268. POTATOES (CHRISTIANA) 

Boil six peeled, good-sized, sound potatoes in two 
quarts of boiling water with a teaspoonful of salt 
thirty minutes. Thoroughly drain them, then press 
them through a potato masher into a frying-pan ; 
add six medium anchovies in oil cut into short pieces, 
half a teaspoonful of chopped parsley, half a tea- 
spoonful of French mustard, half a teaspoonful of 
salt, two saltspoonfuls of white pepper, and half a 
saltspoonful of grated nutmeg ; add two ^g yolks 
and half an ounce of butter ; place the pan on the 
fire, and sharply stir with the spatula while cooking

278. POTATO DUMPLINGS, No. 1 

Mash one pound of steamed potatoes ; keep them 
hot in a saacepan ; stir in one well-beaten egg and one 
taUespoonfnl of cream; then mix in thoroughly 
one breakfastcupful of flour and one teaspoonful 
of baking-powder, and leave the mixture to cool. 
Make it into small dumplings. Put the dumplings 
for fifteen minutes in (slightly salted) boiling water ; 
drain, and serve them. A sharp sauce is an excellent 
addition. 

279. POTATO DUMPLINGS. No. 2 

This is well worthy of a trial. Beat up some dry, 
floury, cooked potatoes until they are perfectly 
smooth, then mix with them one quarter of their 
weight in fine flour ; season with salt, and form into 
a moderately firm paste with an ounce or two of 
fresh butter melted in a little warm milk. Put 
the mixture into a buttered basin and steam over 
plenty of boiling water until the dumpling is quite 
firm and light ; then turn it out carefully on to a 
hot dish, garnish it with sprigs of parsley, and send 
to table very hot, with some pleasantly flavoured 
sauce or gravy as an accompaniment. Or, if pre- 
ferred, instead of sauce or gravy, some stewed 
mushrooms, baked tomatoes, or fried onions, etc., 
may be served with the dumplings. If it is more 
convenient to have the dish served as a sweet 
instead of a savoury, slightly sweeten the potatoes 
and serve with sweet sauce or stewed fruit. 

280. POTATOES FLAKED 

Boil, in their skins, some large, sound, thoroughly 
good potatoes. When they are quite cooked, drain, 
dry, and skin them. Press them through a coarse 
sieve, as lightly as possible, upon a hot dish, and 
serve at once.

281. POTATOES AUX FINES HERBES 

Mix together in a bowl half a teaspoonful of finely 
chopped chives, half a teaspoonful of chopped parsley, 
and half a teaspoonful of finely chopped chervU. 
Boil in a quart of water, with a teaspoonful of salt, 
one pint of potatoes for fifteen minutes. Drain on 
a sieve, place in a frying-pan, season with half a 
teaspoonful of salt and two saltspoonfuls of white 
pepper; then add one tablespoonful and a half 
of melted butter, and the chopped herbs ; gently 
turn with a skimmer while heating for a minute. 
Transfer into a hot, deep dish, and serve. 

282. POTATOES FONDANTES 

Feel and cut into half-inch, dice-shaped pieces 
six sound, medium-sized raw potatoes. Wash well 
and drain. Cut into small pieces and melt in a small 
saucepan one ounce of salt pork ; add one sound, 
finely hashed onion and two bay leaves, and brown 
till of a nice golden colour. Then drop in the pota- 
toes, season with half a teaspoonful of salt and two 
saltspoonfuls of white pepper, and pour in sufficient 
boiling water to cover them up to three-quarters of 
their height. Cover the pan, let them slowly cook for 
forty minutes, and take out the bay-leaves. Drain 
on a hot dish, besprinkling with a little hot parsley, 
and serve. 

283. POTATOES FOULTEES 

Neatly wipe eight even-sized, medium, sound, 
unpeeled, raw potatoes ; place on roasting-pan, and

COOKED PLAINLY OR ELABORATELY 136 

three saltspoonfuls of white pepper, one saltspoonf ul 
of grated nutmeg, one ounce of butter, and half a 
gill of cream. Sharply stir with wooden spoon, 
while heating for four minutes ; remove, fill up six 
of the potato shells with preparation, arrange covers 
on, reset in oven for ten minutes ; remove, dress on 
heated^dish, and serve. 

284. POTATOES (FRANCONIA) 

Pare the potatoes and parboil ten minutes ; 
drain and put in a pan in which meat is roast- 
ing ; baste when the meat is basted. Potatoes 
thus treated will bake in about forty-five minutes. 
Cook turnips and large or ripe cucumbers, pared 
and seeds removed, in the same fashion. 

286. POTATOES FRIED. No. 1 

Peel, clean, and cut into pieces, one-half inch 
square and two and a half inches long, four good- 
sized, sound potatoes. Wash well in cold water and 
drain thoroughly. 

Have some boiling fat in a frying-pan ; plunge in 
the potatoes and fry for ten minutes, being very sure 
that the fat is thoroughly boiling before the potatoes 
are plunged in. Lift up with a skimmer, lay on a 
dish, let rest for one minute, replace in the boiling 
fat, and fry for three minutes more ; lift up with 
a skimmer, lay on a kitchen towel, and dry thor- 
oughly. Sprinkle the equivalent of a teaspoonful 
of salt over them, dress on a hot dish, and serve. 

Fried sweet potatoes are served exactly the same 
way, and both should be promptly served after 
having been prepared. 

286. POTATO FRITTERS 

Peel and grate into a bowl three medium, sound, 
raw potatoes ; add two tablespoonf uls of flour, two

136 MAY BYRON'S VEGETABLE BOOK 

raw eggs, half a teaspoonful of chopped parsley, 
half a teaspoonful of salt, two saltspoonfuls of white 
pepper, one saltspoonf ul of grated nutmeg, and one 
saltspoonful of baking-powder. Sharply mix with 
wooden spoon until well amalgamated. Heat two 
tablespoonfuls of melted lard in a large black frying- 
pan, then drop the preparation in the pan in twelve 
equal cake forms, and slowly fry six minutes on each 
side. Brcmove, drain on paper, then dress on a hot 
dish, and serve. 



287. POTATOES (FRENCH) FRIED 

Scrub and pare the potatoes, and cut in eighths, 
lengthwise ; let stand in water Until all are ready, 
then dry between towels as they are fried. Fry in a 
basket, and use but few at a time. Drain on soft 
paper and sprinkle with salt. Serve at once, as 
they retain their crispness but a short time. Avoid 
having the fat too hot. Often potatoes to be fried 
are soaked an hour or more in ice water ; the ques- 
tion of soaking or not soaking cut potatoes in ice 
water before fr^g is a matter of individual taste. 
When sliced, and left to stand in water, a large 
quantity of starch is lost, and the potato is prob- 
ably more crisp. In the other case, the pieces would 
be softer and more mealy. 



288. POTATOES FRIED WHOLE, BALLS, ETC. 

Potatoes, pared whole, may be cooked in hot fat, 
but the fat should not be too hot, as the potatoes 
must cook about half an hour. If properly cooked, 
the potatoes will be very mealy. Potatoes for 
frying are cut in many fanciful shapes. They make 
an attractive garnish for dishes of broiled meat.

289. POTATOES FRIED, No. 2 

Take raw potatoes, wash, peel, and thoroughly 
dry them. Cut them into circles, strips, or any 
other shape to choice ; drop them into boiling fat, 
and when they are a golden brown, remove, drain, 
set in an open oven or before the fire, dust with salt, 
and serve immediately. In frying cooked potatoes, 
select only the firmest, otherwise they will all go to 
a mash ; and flour the slices before placing them 
in the frjdng-pan, because dryness is essential if 
they are to brown properly. 

290. POTATOES AU GRATIN 

Take four cold, boiled potatoes of middle size 
and slice them evenly in circles. Pr^are a sauce 
as follows : two tablespoonfuls of butter melted in 
a stewpan, thickened with two tablespoonfuls of 
flour, then thinned with one cupful each of cream 
and stock, and brought to boiling-point. Remove 
from fire, and work in two beaten yolks, three table- 
spoonfuls of grated cheese,, salt and pepper to taste. 
Blend thoroughly, and cover the bottom of a pie- 
dish with a layer of the mixture ; next add a layer 
of potato slices, slightly overlapping each other; 
repeat until the dish is full, then cover the top with 
fine breadcrumbs, sprinkle with melted butter, and 
put in a hot oven till coloured a golden brown. 

291. POTATOES TO SERVE WITH FISH 

Pass hot mashed potatoes through a coarse sieve ; 
add a generous piece of butter, a little salt, and hot 
milk or cream, as needed. Beat thoroughly, and press

meg ; mix well, then cook five minutes. Cut into 
small pieces eight anchovies in oil, add them to 
the potatoes, mix well, and let cook five minutes. 
Mix with a spoon once in a while. Transfer to a 
baking-dish, sprinkle surface with two tablespoon- 
fuls of grated Parmesan cheese, arrange a few 
little bits of butter on top of the cheese, then 
set to bake in oven ten minutes. Remove and 
serve.

one saltspoonfol of grated nutmeg, two gills of cold 
nulk, and one gill of cream. Mix well ; let the whole 
boil slowly for ten minutes, stirring once in a while 
with a wooden spoon. 

Butter the bottom of a baking-dish with a tea- 
spoonful of butter. Transfer the potatoes into this 
dish, spread the surface with two tablespoonfuls of 
Parmesan or Swiss cheese (grated), divide half an 
ounce of butter into little bits over the top of the 
cheese. Set the dish in a brisk oven to bake for ten 
minutes or until of a golden colour. Remove and 
serve. 

296. POTATOES HASHED BROWN 

Chop six cold, boiled potatoes very fine, adding 
half a teaspoonful of salt and a dash of pepper.

and, when hot, put in the potatoes and heat quickly 
and thoroughly. Press into one side of the pan to 
form an omelet. When well browned, drain off the 
fat and turn on to a dish. 

296. POTATOES HASHED WHITE 

Butter an omelet pan, and put into it cold, boiled 
potatoes chopped rather fine ; sprinkle with a little 
salt, scatter bits of butter over the top, and pour 
over a little white stock or hot water. Cover and 
cook slowly until thoroughly heated through. Turn 
out carefully into a hot dish without stirring. Care 
needs to be taken that the potato be not browned, 
but the stock and butter absorbed. 

297. POTATOES WITH HERRINGS 

Well wash some potatoes and boil them, taking 
care, however, not to let them break or get too soft ;

then drain off the water, peel and slioe them fairly 
thickly, and keep them hot. In the meantime put a 
chopped onion into a stewpan with an ounce of 
butter, and fry until lightly browned ; then dust 
in some flour, add three tablespoonfuls of vinegar 
and a bay leaf, and rather under a pint of water ; 
season with salt and pepper, draw the pan to the 
side of the stove, and let the sauce simmer for a little. 
Well wash two red herrings, cut them down length- 
ways, remove the bones, then cut up the flesh small, 
put it into the sauce, and let it cook in this for 
a few minutes ; now put in the potatoes, and stir 
them gently round, being careful not to break them. 
Next add two ounces of butter and a gill of milk, 
and stir it all over the fire until it reaches boiling- 
point. When cooked, turn out on to a hot dish, and 
serve. 

298. POTATOES KLOSSE 

Boil one pound of potatoes till they are tender, 
but not mashy. Let them get cold, then grate 
them. Cream four ounces of butter, add three 
whisked eggs, and mix with the grated potato. 
Season to taste with pepper, salt, and nutmeg, and 
blend all thoroughly, using a wooden spoon. Make 
the mixture into small balls, and put them into boil- 
ing water to boil quietly for ten minutes. 

299. POTATOES JULIENNE

Select ripe new potatoes and scrub them until 
the outer skin is removed ; boil quickly in boiling 
salted water, drain perfectly dry, and dust lightly 
with salt from the dredger ; cover with a cloth, and 
keep hot on the back of the range. Fold the pote^ 
toes, singly, in a hot, dry cloth, twist the ends of the 
cloth in opposite directions tightly, then drop the 
dry, mealy potato, white as snow, into the serving- 
dish. Serve before they have become cold. (This 
is an American recipe. We usually prefer new pota* 
toes not to be mealy. — Ed.)

potatoes, pared, a^pint of balls. Cook in boiling 
salted water about ten minutes, or until nearly 
tender; drain, and toss in a frying-pan, in which 
there are four tablespoonfuls of melted butter and 
a little s€tlt. Set the pan in the oven, shaking it 
frequently, until the potatoes are thoroughly cooked 
and well browned ; add a little fresh butter, a dash 
of salt, if needed, and a tablespoonful of chopped 
parsley. Toss the balls about, to distribute the 
ingredients evenly, and serve at once. 

313. POTATOES, PARMENTIER 

Plunge four medium-sized, peeled, raw potatoes 
in two quarts of boiling water, with a teaspoonf ul of 
salt, and boil thirty minutes; drain, and press through 
a potato masher into a bowl. Heat a tablespoonful 
of butter in a small saucepan ; add half a finely 
chopped white onion, and gently brown four minutes, 
occasionally stirring meanwhile ; then add two peeled 
and seeded, crushed red tomatoes ; mix a little and 
cook for five minutes ; then add the potatoes with two 
egg yolks, a tablespoonful of thick cream, half an 
ounce of good butter, half a teaspoonf ul of salt, two 
saltspoonfuls of white pepper, and a saltspoonful of 
grated nutmeg. Sharply mix with a wooden spoon 
while cooking for eight minutes, and remove pan to 
a table.

hot dish, pour a gill of tomato sauce around them, 
and serve. 

814. POTATO PEE 

Slice some sound potatoes, which have been 
boiled and left to grow cold. Put a layer of these 
slices in a buttered baking-dish, and season with a 
sprinkling of salt, pepper, finely minced onion and 
parsley, and grated cheese. Next add a little thick 
white sauce, sufficient to hide the potatoes from 
sight ; repeat until the dish is full, when the sauce 
must be thickly covered with grated cheese. 

316. POTATO GIPSY PIE 

Cut some cold, boiled potatoes in slices about a 
quarter of an inch thick and arrange these in layers 
in a well-greased pie-dish with a little salt, pepper, 
finely minced parsley, boiled onion chopped small, 
and tiny bits of fresh butter between each layer. 
When the dish is sufficiently full, and the potatoes 
on top arranged as evenly as possible, brush over 
the surface very liberally with liquid butter or pure 
beef dripping, and bake in a moderate oven until the 
pie is bubblbag hot and well browned. If preferred, 
a little finely chopped meat of some kind, pleasantly 
seasoned and moistened with good gravy or sauce, 
may be placed between the layers of potatoes, and 
the whole covered in the usual way with a crust of 
well-made, moderately rich pastry. If it happens 
that the potatoes at hand have been mashed, they 
will answer the purpose just as well, and if the pie 
is preferred without a crust, mark the surface 
neatly with the point of a small knife, or by draw- 
ing the prongs of a small fork across it in various

COOKED PLAINLY OR ELABORATELY 147 

ways. Brosh over with liquid butter or dripping, 
or with beaten egg, and bake as already directed. 
Some rich, creamy brown gravy or a weU-flavonred 
saace is a great improvement to a gipsy fie in 
the opinion of some people, while others prefer it 
without; the point must th^^fore be decided 
according to individual taste and oonvenioice. 

316. POTATOES A LA POLONAISE 

Parlxul some potatoes, slice them rather thickly, 
place them in a stewpan with a good hunp of butt^, 
sufficient cream to cover them along with the butter 
when dissolved, and seasoning of salt and pepper. 
Let them stew till quite tender, then serve them up in 
the same liquor, with chopped capers sprinkled 
round them. 

317. POTATO RAGOUT 

Take a medhunnsized onion, parboil and chop it 
finely, along with two ounces of cold meat of any sort 
and six ounces of ham, all finely minced ; add three 
ounces of mashed potates, one teaspoonful and a half 
of parsley, chives, and thyme, two yolks, pepper and 
salt. Mix thoroughly ; whisk two whites to a stiff 
froth, and stir these in lightly ; drop small table- 
spoonfuls of the mixture into boiling fat — absolutely 
boiling — and when they are a golden brown, thor- 
oughly drain and serve at once. 

318. POTATOES ROASTED IN QUARTERS 

Peel and cut four medium, sound, raw potatoes 
into six square pieces each ; wash and drain well, 
place in a frying-pan with two tablespoonfuls of 
melted lard, and fry on the range for ten minutes, 
or until a good golden colour, occasionally turning 
with a skimmer ; then place in a small roasting-tin ;

148 MAY BYRON'S VEGETABLE BOOK 

season with a teaspoonful of salt and half a tea- 
spoonful of pepper. Evenly spread one ounce of 
butter on the surtace of the potatoes, then place in a 
brisk oven for thirty minutes. Remove, lift up with 
a skimmer, place on a dish, and serve. 

319. POTATO ROLLS 

Wipe and roast in a moderate oven for forty-five 
minutes six good-sized, white, raw, unpeeled potatoes. 
Remove, scoop out all the insides, and, with the aid 
of a wooden spoon, press the scooped potatoes through 
a wire sieve into a small saucepan, adding half an 
ounce of good butter, two egg yolks, half a gill of 
cream, half a teaspoonful of salt, two saltspoonfuls 
of pepper, and a saltspoonf ul of grated nutmeg. Set 
pan on range, and sharply stir with a wooden spoon 
while heating for five minutes. Remove, beat the 
whites of the eggs to a stiff froth, and gradually add 
to the potatoes, mixing well meanwhile. Dip two 
tablespoons in melted butter ; with one take up as 
much of the preparation as it can hold, and repeatedly 
turn the potato from one spoon to the other, so as to 
give a nice smooth roll form ; place in a lightly 
buttered tin, and proceed the same with balance 
of the potato preparation. Set in a brisk oven until 
a nice golden colour, or about eight or ten minutes ; 
remove, take up with the blade of a knife, dress on a 
dish, and serve. 

320. POTATO ROSES 

Fill a pastry forcing-bag with duchess potato 
mixture (see No. 275). Hold the bag in an up- 
right position, tube pointing downward, and force 
out the potato; at the proper moment press the 
tube gently into the mixture and raise it quickly, 
to break the flow. To make another style of rose, 
use a six-pointed tube, points almost meeting.

COOKED PLAINLY OR ELABORATELY 149 

Hold the bag in a position at right angles to 
that indicated in the first case, and force out the 
potato in a deeply deft cord, which is coiled round 
and round in smaller and smaller circles ; or shape 
in bow knots. Shape the roses on a buttered tin 
sheet, brush over with beaten ^g, diluted with 
milk or water, and brown in the oven. Remove 
with a spatula or broad-bladed knife, and use as a 
garnish for meat or fish. Smaller roses may be 
arranged between the larger ones, so as to make a 
solid wall, to retain what may be served within. 
Sometimes the whole wall is built up of small roses. 

321. POTATOES RICED 

Pass through a coarse sieve eight hot, boiled 
potatoes ; add three tablespoonfuls of butter, half a 
teaspoonful of salt, and about half a cup of hot 
milk or cream; beat thoroughly with perforated 
cake-spoon, and again pass through the sieve round 
about the meat. 

322. POTATO RISSOLES 

Boil and mash some potatoes; add to them 
finely chopped parsley, onion, salt, pepper, and 
make into small balls. Flour them, and fry a nice 
brown. 

323. POTATO SANDERS 

Mix with cold, boiled potatoes, mashed up or 
passed through a sieve, enough flour to make a 
paste (f .e. nearly half their weight in flour). Dripping 
rubbed in — about four ounces to the pound— will 
greatly improve the paste, but will be debarred 
from the strict vegetarian. Roll out the paste about 
half an inch thick, and cut it in small squares. Soak 
0ome breadcrumbs in a very little water, just

some minced parsley, herbs, a little minced onion, 
and salt. Put a little of this mixture into each 
square of paste, roll up, and bake as a sausage roll. 

324. POTATOES IN SAUCE 

Make some melted butter, flavoured with lemon- 
juice ; cut some cold boiled potatoes in slices, with 
pepper and salt; put them in a dish in the oven, and 
throw over them the melted butter ; cover the dish, 
and bake for twenty minutes. 

825. POTATOES WITH WHITE SAUCOS 

Put into a saucepan a small slice of butter, with a 
little flour, diluted with a little stock, to which add 
some salt and pepper, and thicken it over the fire ; 
having boiled the potatoes, peeled them, and cut 
them into slices, pour this sauce over them, and 
serve hot. To vary the flavour, some minced 
capers or a little chopped parsley may be added to 
the sauce. 

326. POTATOES SAUT6, No. 1 

Cut some cold boiled potatoes into slices, and fry 
them in a frying-pan ; season with pepper, salt, and 
a good handful of chopped parsley. Turn them 
over, fry a good brown, and serve very hot. 

827. POTATOES SAUT6, No 2 

Take some sound potatoes ; wash, peel, and par- 
boil; then drain, dry, slice, and by them. The 
thinner they are cut, the more carefidly they must 
be fried. Be sure that the fat is absolutely boiling 
(you can tell by a thin blue smoke). When they 
are nicely browned on both sides, drain and dish 
up, dusting a little salt over, and sprinkling at 
pleasure with some finely chopped pwdey.

328. POTATO SAVOURIES 

Boil and mash some potatoes ; moisten with milk ; 
add a seasoning of salt, pepper, chopped herbs, and 
grated lemon-rind. Have some small patty-pans 
buttered and dusted with fine crumbs; fill these 
with the potato mixture, lay a little bit of butter 
on the top of each, and brown them in a moderate 
oven. 

329. POTATOES SEETHED 

A number of small potatoes, or if large potatoes, 
cut in slices, are put into a cast-iron pot withoni 
a lid, with a sprinkling of salt, to which is some- 
times added a small piece of butter, with very little 
water. No person who has not eaten potatoes thus 
prepared can conceive how delicious they are. 

330. POTATOES SCALLOPED 

Pare five or six potatoes, and cut in thin slices ; 
dispose these in a buttered baking-dish in layers; 
sprinkle the layers with salt and pepper, onion-juice, 
and finely chopped parsley ; dredge with flour, and 
add a few bits of butter. Pour just enough hot milk 
over the potatoes to cover them, and bake in a 
moderate oven about an hour and a half. This dish 
may be prepared with cold, boiled potatoes, and the 
time of cooking cut down nearly one-half ; also the 
quantity of milk required is less. 

331. POTATOES, SNOW 

Boil twelve medium potatoes with jackets on in 
two quarts of water, with a teaspoonful of salt, for 
thirty minutes. Drain, peel, season with half a 
teaspoonful of salt and three saltspoonfuls of white 
pepper, then rub them through a sieve into a serving- 
dish, and serve. (Carefully avoid touching the 
potatoes after they drop from the sieve.)

332. POTATO SOUFFUfi 

Neatly wipe and place six good-sized, sound 
potatoes in a roasting-pan and place in oven for 
forty-five minutes, turning once in a while. Re- 
move, cut each potato in half lengthwise, then 
scoop out interior ; press meat through sieve into a 
saucepan, add half an ounce of butter, two ^g 
yolks, half a teaspoonful of salt, two saltspoonfuls of 
pepper, and one tablespoonful of cream ; sharply stir 
on fire with wooden spoon while heating for five 
minutes, then remove to a table. Beat up whites 
of three eggs to a stiff froth, add to potatoes, and 
gently mix. Evenly divide preparation in the 
twelve shells; with a lightly buttered knife-blade 
neatly smooth surface of each, place on a tin, and set 
in brisk oven for fifteen minutes ; remove, dress on 
hot dish, and serve. 

333. POTATOES STEWED, No. 1 

Have two tablespoonfuls of flour and three ounces 
of butter well browned in a stewpan. Stir in half 
a pint of stock and two tablespoonfuls of lemon- 
juice. Take about eight fair-sized potatoes, peel 
and cut into thin strips, and let them simmer 
slowly in the gravy till quite tender, but do not let 
them break. If the gravy requires a little more 
thickening, remove the potatoes first into a hot 
vegetable dish ; then thicken the gravy and pour 
it over them. 

334. POTATOES STEWED, No. 2 

Take a pipkin — having a lid. Lay in it one or 
two or more rows of potatoes, with the skins 
scraped off, and cut into slices. Sprinkle a little 
pepper and salt over them, then lay a row of 
onions, next, if it can be afforded, a mutton chop ; 



Digitized by VnOOQ IC 



COOKED PLAINLY OR ELABORATELY 163 

let there be layers of potatoes, onions, pepper 
and salt and mutton, until the pipkin is filled. 
If mutton cannot be afforded, use a very small por- 
tion of dripping or mutton suet ; add a teacupful of 
water. Put the pipkin, tvUh the lid made to fit close 
over it with a piece of linen cloth, into a pan of water 
toUJunU a lid. Let the water boil very slowly, or 
rather simmer, for five or six hours. Potatoes, when 
thus prepared, afford a most savoury and nourishing 
meal. 

336. POTATOES STEWED, No. 3 

Boil five good-sized, sound potatoes in a quart of 
boiling water with a teaspoonful of salt for thirty- 
five minutes; peel and slice them rather thin.

teaspoonful of flour, mbdng well. Now add one gill 
and a half of boiling milk and half a gill of hot cream. 
Mix well with wire whisk. Drop the potatoes into 
the pan. Season with half a teaspoonful of salt, 
two saltspoonfuls of white pepper, and one salt- 
spoonful of grated nutmeg, also half a teaspoonful 
of butter. Toss them well and let cook ten minutes. 
Pour on a hot dish, sprinkle half a teaspoonful of 
chopped parsley over, and serve. 

336. POTATOES STEWED IN BilLK 

Cut some potatoes, waxy ones for choice, into 
slices. Melt two ounces of butter in a pan ; add to 
this gradually one ounce of flour, and stir it gently 
together without allowing the flour to colour ; then 
add in by degrees one pint of cold milk, stirring all 
the time ; directly this reaches the boil, put in the 
potatoes, being ccireful to see they are well covered 
by the liquid ; add a seasoning of salt, and put on 
the lid tightly ; then let the whole sinmier gently 
at the side of the fire till the potatoes are cooked ;

light golden colour. Remove and drain thoroughly, 
sprinkle with salt, and serve with cut lemon. 

338. POTATO STRAWS, No. 2 

Take some good evenly shaped, raw potatoes, 
slice them into straws about a quarter of an inch 
thick, and wash these in cold water. Dry them with 
a cloth, and fry in boiling fat till they are a golden 
brown. They must be drained, sprinkled with salt, 
and served with a dusting of finely minced parsley. 

839. POTATOES STUFFED, No. 1 

Take ten good-sized potatoes ; clean, and bake in 
their skins in a sharp oven. When they are quite 
soft, slice off one end of each, scoop out the inside, 
and mash it thoroughly with salt, pepper, milk, and 
butter. When thoroughly blended, refill the potato 
skins, smear a little melted butter over the cut end, 
and put back in the oven till this is brown. 

340. POTATOES STUFFED, No. 2 

Neatly wipe eight even-sized, large, raw potatoes ; 
place them in a roasting-tin and bake in the oven for 
forty-five minutes ; remove, cut in two lengthwise, 
then with a teaspoon scoop out the interiors into a 
bowl, and keep six shells apart. Season the pota- 
toes with a half-teaspoonful of salt, two saltspoonfuls

of pepper, and a saltspoonful of grated nutmeg ; add 
half an ounce of butter and half a gill of cream. 
Mix well with a wooden spoon, then fill up the six 
half Hshells with the pur6e ; neatly smooth the surface 
with the blade of a knife, sprinkle a tablespoonful 
of Parmesan cheese evenly divided over them, 
place on a roasting-tin, and arrange a very little bit 
of butter over each potato. Set in the oven for ten 
minutes, dress on a dish, and serve. 



341. POTATOES STUFFED, No. 3 

Stdn and parboil six large potatoes ; scoop out 
a good deal of the inside ; fill with forcemeat, having 
a few breadcrumbs and butter over each opening ; 
place them in a tin in the oven, and bake for at 
least two hours, or until the potatoes are quite 
tender. 



342. POTATOES STUFFED WITH ANCHOVIES 

Thoroughly wipe eight medium, peeled, raw 
potatoes ; place in a roasting-pan, and set in oven 
for forty-five minutes, turning them once in a while. 
Remove, cut them in two lengthwise, thoroughly 
scoop out insides; place meat in a bowl, add an 
ounce of butter, twelve anchovies in oil cut in small 
pieces, half a teaspoonful of salt, three saltspoonfuls 
of pepper, and a saltspoonful of grated nutmeg. 
Sha^ly stir with wooden spoon until smooth, then 
gradually pour in half a gill of hot milk, sharply 
stirring while adding it. With a spoon fill up cavi- 
ties of twelve sheUs (only) of potatoes with the pur^, 
lay them in a tin, sprinkle a little grated Parmesan 
cheese over, and place a little bit of butter on top 
of each potato. Set in oven for fifteen minutes ;

343. POTATOES STUFFED WITH CHEESE 

Take eight equal-sized potatoes, bake them, and 
cut a slice off each. Scoop out as much of the 
inside as you can, and pass it through a sieve; 
season it with salt, pepper, and nutmeg ; add a 
third of its quantity in grated cheese ; moisten with 
three beaten yolks and a little milk. Whisk stiff 
the whites of three eggs, and quickly fold them into 
the mixture. Fill the hollowed potatoes with it, 
return them to the oven, and serve hot, with a 
garnish of fried parsley. 

344. POTATOES SYRACUSE 

Select potatoes of medium size and smooth skin 
and scrub clean ; have ready a kettle of brine at 
the boiling-point ; put in potatoes, cover, and boil 
until tender ; remove from the water, and drain. 
Serve at once. The outside will be covered with 
salt crystals, and the inside will be white and mealy. 

845. POTATOES VERT-PRE 

Remove the stalks and thoroughly wash a pint 
of very fresh spinach leaves ; drain, and plunge in a 
quart of boiling water with a teaspoonful of ^t for 
ten minutes. Drain on a sieve and press out all the 
water, then chop them exceedingly fine. Prepare 
a mashed potato preparation, add and mix well 
the spinach with the potatoes, dress on a vegetable 
dish, neatly smooth iJl around with the blade of a 
knife, and serve. 

346. POTATOES VIENNOISE 

Prepare the same quantity of potatoes as for 
potato brioches (see No. 262). Divide the pur6e 
into six equal parts. Sift a little flour on the comer 
of the table. Boll out each piece to a nice oval

form. Slightly flatten them with the blade of a 
knife to the forms of Vienna bread ; then with the 
knife again make a double incision lengthwise on 
the surface of each. Lightly butter a baking-pan, 
and lay the potatoes into the pan ; lightly glaze 
the surface of each with the yolk of an egg, then 
place them in a very brisk oven to bake for twelve 
minutes. Remove, dress on a hot dish, and serve. 



347. POTATOES VILLAGEOIS 

Peel, wash, and cut in quarter-inch squares four 
good-sized potatoes ; place in a small saucepan 
with a pint of white broth, season with half a tea- 
spoonful of salt, two saltspoonfuls of pepper, and a

349. POTATOES WARMED IN MILK 

Melt two or three tablespoonfuls of butter in a 
frying-pan, and in it toss a pint of cold, boiled pota- 
toes, sliced thin; when the butter is absorbed, 
sprinkle with salt, and add enough milk to show 
between the slices; cover and let cook until the 
milk is nearly absorbed; then turn into a hot 
serving-dish. Sprinkle with finely chopped parsley. 



SWEET POTATOES 

NoTB. — These are the potatoes first used in 
England, known also in Elizabethan days as 
" Skirrets of Peru." Yet they are not true potatoes, 
or Solanums, at all; but the tubers of a species 
of convolvulus, IpomoBa baUUis. They are very little 
used or grown in this country ; but in America they 
are a common viand, being digestible, nutrient, 
and satisfying. They are large, coarse, and thick- 
skinned ; as a rule somewhat pasty and slimy as 
compared to the fiouriness of true potatoes — one 
might almost suppose they contained lard or other 
fatty matter. A liking for sweet potatoes may be 
considered an acquired taste ; but, properly cooked, 
they can be made quite alluring. They are mostly 
served as sweet dishes. 

Preparation. — ^As for ordinary potatoes. If 
plainly boiled, they should be cooked in their skins, 
which must be removed before serving. 

360. SWEET POTATOES BAKED 

Select six good-sized, sound sweet potatoes. 
Slightly trim off both ends, wipe and place them on 
a tin plate, baking in the hot oven for forty-five 
minutes, and turning them over every ten minutes. 
Remove, and serve on a hot dish.

351. SWEET POTATOES BAKED IN THE HALF 
SHELL 

Select shapely sweet potatoes of even size ; wash 
and scrub with care. Bake and cut in hcdves, 
lengthwise. Remove the pulp from the skins, and 
pass it through a coarse sieve. Season with salt, 
butter, and cream. Beat imtil smooth, then refill 
the skins with the mixture, using pastry-bag and 
star tube. Reheat before serving. If desired, dust 
the tops with powdered sugar and cinnamon before 
reheating. 

862. SWEET POTATOES CANDIED 

Pare and parboil half a dozen sweet potatoes 
cut in halves lengthwise. After ten minutes' boiling, 
drain, and lay in a baking-dish. Spread thickly 
with butter, sprinkle with sugar, and, if desired, a 
little powdered cinnamon ; add a few spoonfuls of 
hot water, and bake until tender, basting often with 
the sauce in the pan. Use brown sugar. 

863. SWEET POTATO-AND-ALMOND CROQUETTES 

Bake several sweet potatoes. As soon as they are 
soft, break apart, scrape out the pulp, and pass 
through a squash strainer. To each pint of pulp 
add one teaspoonful of salt, two tablespoonfuls of 
butter, one beaten egg, three tablespooonfuls of 
blanched almonds, chopped and pounded in a mor- 
tar, and hot milk, or cream, to make of a consistency 
to handle. Form into the shapes of apples and pears, 
egg-and-breadcrumb, and fry in deep fat. Finish 
with stalks of parsley for stems. 

364. SWEET POTATOES, SOUTHERN STYLfi 

Into a large flat-bottomed saucepan put one- 
fourth of a cup of butter and two tablespoonfuls 



Digitized by VnOOQ IC 



160 MAY BYRON'S VEGETABLE BOOK 

of sugar. When hot, lay in raw sweet potatoes 
pared and cut in halves, lengthwise, to cover the 
bottom ; season with salt and pepper, and cover 
not very closely with another layer of potatoes. 
Pour on boiling water to half-cover the lower layer, 
cover the vessel tightly, and set where the heat is 
gentle. When the lower layer is browned, remove 
to the top, letting the other brown. When both 
layers ard tender, the water should have evaporated, 
leaving a little sauce to pour over the potatoes in 
the serving-dish. If preferred, this dish may be 
cooked in a casserole in the oven. 



RADISHES 

NoTB. — ^These have been eaten and relished for 
thousands of years : but they do not agree with 
many people, though if fresh from your own garden 
they are quite wholesome. 

Although usually regarded as salading, radishes 
make a good cooked vegetable ; either the leaves 
or the roots can be used. Round or turnip radishes 
are the best for this purpose. 

Preparation. — ^Remove the leaves, close against 
the ball of the radishes ; trim away the root ; wash 
well, but do not scrape or peel unless they are very 
old. 

366. RADISHES BOILED 

Prepare as above, put into fast-boiling salted 
water ; boil till tender — say about half an hour. 
Drain, dish, and serve with a white sauce. 

366. RADISH LEAVES BOILED 

Only sound young leaves should be used. Let 
them lie in cold water for at least half an hour, then 
drain and shake them, and put them into fast-boiling 



Digitized by VnOOQ IC 



COOKED PLAINLY OR ELABORATELY 161 

salted water. Boil till tender — say about half an 
hour. Strain off the water, chop the leaves small, 
add a little butter, pepper, and salt, reheat, and 
serve with fried croutons. Or treat by any of the 
methods for spinach. 

357. RADISHES CURRIED 

Take some large firm radishes; wash, and cut 
them up in large cubes, but do not peel them. Place 
them in a pan of hot olive oil, and let them cook for 
thirty minutes, continually stirring them or they 
will bum. When they are quite tender, add one 
teaspoonful of curry-powder and a sprinkling of salt. 
Serve immediately. 

RAMPION 

Note. — ^This native British plant, of the Cam- 
panula or Bellflower tribe, has fallen into disuse as a 
market vegetable, though still privately cultivated 
by some. Abroad it is held in more favour. The 
long, fleshy, carrot-shaped white roots are edible, 
either boiled or used raw in salads. 

Various curious superstitions and fairy-tales are 
attached to this plant, such as the legend of 
Bajmmel (Rampion), familiar to all readers of 
Grimm or of William Morris. 

Preparation.— Wash and scrape the roots ; throw 
them, as you do so, into a bowl of cold water 
with two tablespoonfuls of vinegar or lemon-juice. 
Leave them five minutes, then proceed to cook 
them. 

368. RAMPION BOILED 

Prepare, as above, about a dozen roots. Have 
ready boiling, in a lined pan, half a pint of water, 
quarter of a pint of milk, hsdf an ounce of butter, 

a

162 MAY BYRON'S VEGETABLE BOOK 

two slices of lemon, half a teaspoonful of salt. Boil 
until tender — say about one hour and a quarter. 
Remove, drain, and serve wliole with white sauce, 
melted butter, or Sauce HoUandaise ; or thicken 
the liquor in which they were cooked. 



SALSIFY (OR OYSTER-PLANT) AND SCORZO- 
NERA (OR VIPER'S GRASS) 

Note. — ^These two vegetables, being so very much 
of a muchness, are usually dealt with together. 
Salsify is one of the goat's-beard species, commonly 
known as '^ John-go-to-bed-at-noon " from its extra- 
ordinary habit of early-closing. Both are hardy 
herbaceous plants, salsify being biennial and scor- 
zonera perennial, and in both cases it is the long 
fleshy tapering roots which are cooked and eaten. 
Scorzonera (also known as black salsify) is on the 
whole the better of the two ; but neither is so much 
used as was formerly the case, which seems a pity, 
as they make a nice variety as a winter vegetable. 

Preparation. — For salsify, wash and scrape a 
dozen or so of roots, place them for about five 
minutes in cold water acidulated with two table- 
spoonfuls of lemon-juice or vinegar; then put 
them in a lined stewpan in which you have ready 
boiling three-quarters of a pint of mixed milk and 
water, half an ounce of butter, seasoning of salt and 
pepper, and a couple of slices of lemon. Let boil 
fast tiU tender, which will not be under an hour. 
Remove, drain, and serve, with a sauce separately ; 
Sauce HoUandaise, beurre fondu, and melted butter, 
are suitable. 

Scorzonera may be treated exactly the same, 
with one exception ; wash, but do not scrape it — 
instead, peel it after cooking. Take care not to let 
it grow cool in this process.

359. SALSIFY BOILED 

Take salsify roots, scrape them and cut them into 
small lengths (about three inches) ; leave them in a 
bowl of cold water, with a squeeze of lemon-juice, 
till you have a pan of fast-boiling salted water 
ready for them. Let them boil quickly for one hour ; 
when quite tender, they must be drained and laid 
on buttered toast, and a good white sauce poured 
over them. 

360. SALSIFY CROQUETTES 

Boil some salsify as above ; when it is quite tender, 
put it through a coarse sieve or colander ; add a little 
salt, pepper, butter, milk or cream, and a squeeze of 
lemon-juice. Beat thoroughly till the mixture is 
smooth and stiff ; then shape, cover with egg and 
breadcrumbs, and fry. 

361. SALSIFY FRIED 

Proceed as for boiled salsify, and, when it is tender, 
drain it thoroughly and dry it in a cloth. Prepare 
a batter with one tablespoonful of butter, six table- 
spoonfuls of flour, half a teaspoonful of salt, a little 
water, and two beaten eggs. When this is quite 
smooth, dip in the pieces of salsify ; let them be well 
coated with the batter, and fry them in boiling fat. 
When they are a nice golden brown, remove, drain, 
and serve. 

362. SALSIFY FRIED IN BUTTER 

Scrape and trim well a bunch of good fresh salsify 
roots. Place in cold water with two tablespoonfuls 
of vinegar for five minutes. Remove, diuin, cut 
into pieces one inch long. Put into a saucepan with 
one tablespoonful each of salt, vinegar, and flour, 
and three pints of cold water. Cover the pan and 



Digitized by VnOOQ IC 



164 MAY BYRON'S VEGETABLE BOOK 

boil slowly for forty minutes. Drain well, wipe 
gently. Heat in a firing-pan one and a half table- 
spoonfuls of butter ; put the salsify in, with two 
saltspoonfuls of salt and one of white pepper ; toss 
and shuffle them for five minutes. Add the juice of 
half a lemon, and a teaspoonful of parsley finely 
minced. Gently toss for a minute more, and serve. 

363. SALSIFY SCALLOPED 

Proceed as for boiled salsify ; then dust a buttered 
pie-dish with fine crumbs, putting a layer at the 
bottom, and place a layer of salsify next, sprinkled 
with salt, pepper, melt^ butter, and minced parsley. 
Repeat tiU the dish is full; then pour in milk, 
from a pint to a quart, according to size, and bake 
in a moderate oven for an hour and a half • 



SEAKALE 

Note. — ^This pleasant and nutritious vegetable 
reverses the general rule as regards our apathy 
towards native growths; for whereas seakale, or 
sea-colewort, a coast plant, has been eaten locally 
for some centuries, and sold in London markets for 
at least two hundred years, it has never " caught on '* 
over-seas. It is practically ignored in Continental 
and in Transatlantic cookery-books ; and, although 
it is easy to grow, and a hardy perennial, it is for 
some inscrutable reason considered, with us, more or 
less of a delicacy and luxury. It should be much 
more popular than it is. For those who require 
alkaline properties in food, it is especially advisable. 

Preparation. — ^Wash the seakale, and make into 
small bundles, as with asparagus, leaving only just 
sufficient of the main stump to prevent the branches 
falling asunder. Place in boiling salted water, and 



Digitized by VnOOQ IC 



COOKED PLAINLY OR ELABORATELY 165 

let boil till tender — about twenty-five to thirty 
minutes. Serve in any of the wajrs directed for 
asparagus, and accompanied with similar sauce 
in a separate dish. Cold cooked seakcJe comes in 
useful for salads if no sauce has been poured over it. 
Seakale may be also treated by most of the methods 
suggested for cooking asparagus. 

364. SEAKALE BOILED 

Wash the seakale, and fasten it up in small neat 
bundles. Place it in boiling salted water, sufiScient 
just to cover it ; let it boil till tender. Remove, 
drain, unloose the bundles, and serve upon toast, 
plain or buttered, with a good white sauce poured 
over. 

366. SEAKALE STEWED 

Wash, tie up, and parboil the seakale ; then drain 
and place it in some good gravy at boiling-point in 
a stewpan ; let it stew gently for about fifteen 
minutes. Remove, and place it on toast in a hot 
dish ; slightly thicken the gravy and pour it over. 



SKIRRETS 

Note. — Skirrets (which are usually mentioned in 
the plural) remind one of the little girl Jemima in 
the nursery lyric commonly attributed to Longfellow. 
" When she was good, she was very, very good ; and 
when she was bad, she was horrid." That is to say, 
it all depends upon your individual personal taste 
whether you love or hate the skirret. It is origin- 
ally a Chinese plant, and suggests, in its flavour and 
appearance, something exotic and unknown. "' This 
is that skirret which Tiberius the Emperor com- 
manded to be conveied unto him from Gelduba, a

castle about the river of Rhine," and which afforded 
that connoisseur so much enjoyment ^' that he desired 
the same to be brought unto him eyerie yeare out 
of Germanie." Its fleshy, tuberous white roots are 
slightly sweet, and went by the name of sugar-root 
in the Netherlands ; but the taste is decidedly 
peculiar. According to Gerarde, it may be boiled, 
stewed, baked, and made into pies, sliced or pulped. 
In Scotland, skirret was termed crummock. It is 
rarely seen upon our present bills of fare, but might 
well be revived, if only for a change, and as a useful 
winter v^etable. 

Preparation. — (a) as for salsify ; (6) as for pars- 
nips (which see). 



366. SKIRRETS BOILED 

Take about a dozen roots of skirret, wash and 
scrape them well, and drop them into a bowl of cold 
water, acidulated with vinegar or lemon-juice. 
Leave them there five minutes, or until you have 
ready boiling, in a lined pan, three-quarters of a

SORREL 

Note. — ^A sorrel-bed was at one time indis- 
pensable in every well-kept garden ; but the cul- 
tivation of this wholesome vegetable has been 
neglected of recent years in Britain. In C!ontinentaI 
countries it is much and wisely esteemed. The 
best sorrel available for culinary purposes is French. 
It has a peculiar but fascinating acidity, from which 
some people are averse ; to modify this acidity, 
sorrel may be mixed with spinach or with lettuce, 
and a certain amount of sugar is usuaUy added 
in cooking it. It is occasionally employ^ as an 
adjunct to salads ; but do not use too much of it. 

Preparation, — Sorrel should be well picked, and 
the stalks removed, as with spinach. If the leaves 
be large and past their first youth, shred them, 
tearing away the midrib. Sorrel, like spinach, needs 
to be well washed and drained. 

368. SORREL BOILED 

Prepare as above, using plenty of water and several 
washings; drain, shake, and put in a stewpan, 
using one ounce of butter and one teaspoonful of 
sugar to each quart of sorrel. No water is required. 
Let it cook gently till quite tender and consider- 
ably reduced, then dredge in a little flour. Stir 
well over the fire, pass through a sieve ; return to 
the pan, add another ounce of butter, and a dust of 
sugar ; beat up thoroughly, and serve. 

See also any of the methods used for Spinach ; 
but remember to include a little sugar. 

SPINACH 

Note. — ^This attractive and useful plant appears 
to have been cultivated in British kitchen gardens 
ever since the sixteenth century, when it was 



Digitized by VnOOQ IC 



168 MAY BYRON'S VEGETABLE BOOK 

brought in, like so many others, by the Dutch and 
Flemings, who had been growing it for at least 
two centuries earlier. It is supposed to have come 
originally from Asia, through Spain ; a curious 
Odyssey of wanderings for so simple and unpre- 
tentious a vegetable. 

Preparation. — ^As cooked in England, spinach is 
spoiled, in nine cases out of ten, by using too much 
water, which not only washes away its mineral 
salts, but deprives it of individual flavour. It 

/ should be cooked in its own juices, if possible, the 
^ • I amount of moisture adhering to the leaves being 

\^ quite sufficient. Let it be carefully picked over, 
well washed, then dried by swinging the leaves to 
and fro in a piece of butter-muslin. Place the 
leaves in a double-boiler, or other vessel surrounded 
by boiling water, for twenty to twenty-five minutes. 
Ilemove them from the fire, chop them fairly finely, 
add a little butter, pepper, and salt, and serve in 
a hot dish. 

The following recipes mostly follow the usual 
fallacy of " drowning the miller " in water ; but 
you have your choice of the better way. 



369. SPINACH A L'ANGLAISE 

Trim away the stale leaves and stalks, clean and 
wash carefully in three different waters three quarts 
of fresh and sound spinach. Have in quite a large 
^ saucepan one gaU^ of boiling water with one table- 
( spoonful of salt. When the water is thoroughly 
boiling, plunge in the spinach. Cover the pan, and 
aUow to thoroughly boil for ten minutes. Lift it 
up with a skimmer. Lay on a sieve^ to drain well. 

Lightly brown in a saucepan one ounce of good 
butter, then add the well-drained spinach. Season 
with half a teaspoonful of salt, two saltspoonfuls of 
^hite pei^r, adding one teaspoonful of powdered

sugar. Mix well with a fork occasionaUy while 
cooking for five minutes. 

370. SPINACH BALLS 

Melt two tablespoonfuls of butter; add two 
tablespoonfuls of flour and half a teaspoonful of 
sugar. When blended, add a tablespoonful of 
cream and three-quarters of a cup of cooked spinach, 
chopped fine. Beat well, remove from the fire, and 
add two eggs, one at a time. Season with salt and 
pepper, to taste, and a few grains of mace. Butter 
a tablespoon and fill with the spinach mixture, 
making it level with the edge of the spoon, and 
poach in a saucepan of boiling water four or five 
minutes or until firm. The water must not boil 
hard, but simply simmer very gently at one side. 
Six or more baUs may be cooked at one time. Let 
drain in a colander while making a cream sauce ; 
reheat the balls in the sauce, and serve. A tea- 
spoonful of the sauce with three or four capers in 
may be placed on the top of each ball, and the rest 
of the sauce poured around the balls. 

371. SPINACH A LA BECHAMEL 

Drain the spinach and chop fine, or pass through a 
sieve. Return to the saucepan, and for each pint 
of spinach add a tablespooi^Eul of butter, salt and 
pepper. Stir over the fire until the spinach is hot ; 
then add the beaten yolk of an egg diluted with one- 
third of a cup of cream. Stir and cook a moment, 
or until blended. 

372. SPINACH BOILED 

Take two pounds of spinach, pick it carefully to 
remove any withered leaves or bits of weed, cut oflf 
the stalks, and place it in a large bowl of cold water. 
y^efih the leaves in this by moving them up and

down, but do not braise, squeeze, or break them. 
Lift them out carefully into another bowl of water, 
and wash as before ; if you do it a third time, so 
much the better, but be sure to remove the spinach 
from the water; don't drain the water oflf the 
spinach, or you will get all the sand and grit back 
which you have just washed oflf. Place the spinach 
in a pan with a little salt; by careful watching, 
you can boil it in its own moisture — this is much 
the best ; but, otherwise, only put just enough 
boiling salted water to cover it. After about twenty 
minutes' boiling, drain oflf the water, and chop the 
spinach very small in a heated bowl. Heat a 
tablespoonful of butter in a stewpan, put in the 
spinach, add salt and pepper to taste ; let it get 
well heated, and serve on buttered toast in a hot 
dish. Halved hard-boiled eggs may be placed on 
top at discretion. 



373. SPINACH WITH CREAM 

Procure three quarts of fresh spinach. Discard 
all stale leaves or stalks, if any adhering, then wash 
in three diflferent fresh waters ; take them up and 
drop into a pan with one gallon of boiling water, 
with a tablespoonful of salt, and let boil for five 
minutes. Drain well on a sieve and completely 
squeeze the water out, then hash up very finely. 
Have one ounce of melted butter in a saucepan with 
two tablespoonfuls of flour ; stir well with a wooden 
spoon while heating for one minute ; then pour in 
three-quarters of a gill of cold cream and same 
quantity of cold milk. Season with a teaspoonful 
of salt, one saltspoonful of cayenne pepper, and a 
saltspoonful of grated nutmeg, and briskly whisk 
for one minute ; add the spinach, mix well with a 
spoon, cook for five minutes, and serve in a vegetable 
dish.

drain on a sieve, press out all the water, and chop 
very finely, then place them in a saucepan. Cut 
three slices of sandwich bread in one-third-inch 
square pieces, and place on a plate ; pour over them 
a tablespoonful of vin^ar, then brown them in a 
small fiying-pan, with a tablespoonful of melted 
butter, to a good golden colour, and add them to the 
spinach, with two hard-boiled eggs cut into eight 
pieces each, half an ounce of butter, half a teaspoon-

TOMATOES 

Note. — ^The tomato, really a fruit, is here for con- 
venience' sake classed along with vegetables. It is a 
member of the remarkable Solanaeece order already 
discussed, and is a near kinsman of the potato, ^g- 
plant, and capsicum. It was introduced into Eng- 
land from Southern Europe, during the Elizabethan 
period, and termed the Apple of Love, or sometimes 
Pamufnaureum; originally, however, it was a native 
of South America, and its name is derived from the 
Mexican iomaU. For at least three centuries the 
tomato has been gradually widening in popularity, 
until at last, from a londy position of select aristo- 
cratic expensiveness, it has become one of the com- 
monest and (frequently) cheapest of fruit-v^etablee, 
an everyday constituent of the costermonger's 
collection. Of course there are tomatoes and 
tomatoes. The English-grown ones are incom- 
parably the best ; but for cooking, as distinguished 
from salad purposes, the foreign ones, if sound, will 
suffice. Avoid, however, unripe and green ones ; 
and on no account buy pulpy over-ripe ones. If 
you cannot obtain the happy medium, it is better to 
do without them. 

Preparaiian. — ^Varies according to the nature of 
the dish, but in every case the tomatoes should 
be gently wiped with a soft towel, the stalks and 
flower-tops removed; and, if it be desirable to 
skin them, plunge them for a minute into very 
hot water ; they can then be easily skinned with 
a sharp knife.

pint of chopped mushrooms, and stir and cook until 
the moisture evaporates ; now add the tomato pulp, 
half a cup of lean ham, cooked and chopped fine, 
half a cup of breadcrumbs (stale not dried), a few 
leaves of sweet herbs tied in a parsley branch, 
salt and pepper with broth or thickened sauce to 
moisten ; stir and cook until thoroughly heated, 
then remove the parsley branch and fill the toma- 
toes. The mixture should not be too moist. Set

the tomatoeB in a baking-tin, and sprinkle with 
grated cheese and battered cnunbs. Bake about 
half an hour in a moderate oven. 



402. TOMATOES TR^VISE 

Cut six even-sized, large, fresh, red tomatoes in 
halves crosswise. Squeeze out the liquor into a 
saucepan, keeping tiie shells; add one gill of 
tomato sauce, half a gill of claret, two ounces of 
chopped ham, and half a teaspoonful of finely 
chopped parsley. Place on fire, and let reduce 
fifteen minutes; then add five tablespoonfuls of 
fresh breadcrumbs; lightly mix. Remove from 
the fire, arrange tomatoes on a tin. Evenly season 
with half a teaspoonful of salt, half a teaspoonful 
of sugar, and two saltspoonfuls of pepper. Evenly 
divide forcemeat in the twelve half tomatoes. 
Sprinkle a little grated Parmesan cheese over, 
arrange a few little bits of butter on top, then set 
in oven for twenty minutes. Remove, arrange on 
a hot dish, and serve. 

403. TOBfATO WITH VERMICELLI 

Melt in a saucepan one ounce of butter ; add one 
ounce of finely chopped ham, one medium chopped 
carrot, one medium chopped onion, two branches 
of parsley, one chopped leek, ten whole black 
peppers, one clove, one bay leaf, one saltspoonful of 
thyme. Mix well and brown nicely for fifteen 
minutes, occasionally mixing meanwhile ; add one 
quart of tinned— or the equivalent of fresh crushed — 
tomatoes, with two and a half quarts of white broth 
or water. Season with a level tablespoonf ul of salt 
and one light tablespoonful of sugar. If there be 
any bones on hand, either of beef or poultry, add 
them to the stock.

184 MAY BYRON'S VEGETABLE BOOK 

Cover the pan, and let gently boil for one hour and 
fifteen minutes. Heat in a saucepan one table- 
spoonful of melted butter, and add two table- 
spoonfuls of flour. Mix well while browning for two 
minutes, then thicken the soup with tUs, con- 
tinuing to mix with the wooden spoon while adding 
it. Boil for fifteen minutes longer, and strain through 
a sieve into another saucepan. Boil one gill of 
broken vermicelli in a pint of water for eight minutes. 
Drain well, and add it to the soup. Boil again for 
five minutes. Pour into a hot soup tureen, and 
serve. 



TRUFFLES 

Note. — ^These are subterranean fungi, which grow 
in curious clusters under the soil of woods, and are 
never seen upon the surface. They are only discover- 
able by their smell; and only specially trained 
animals (dogs and pigs) have sufficient sense of smell 
to find tiiem. There are various kinds, black, red, 
white, and grey. The truffle is so nitrogenous that 
it may almost be considered as animal food ; but it 
is a luxury, of course, and an expensive one. I 
have often wondered whether truffle-hunters and 
truffle-eaters get as much fun for their money as 
' do country children grubbing aft &r pig-nuts, tliose 
pleasing tubers of the umbelliferous woodland 
plant Cenopodiumy which one discovers and devours 
with such relish in the golden years before one's 
" 'teens." Truffles grow wild in Britain ; chiefly 
under beeches and oaks. 

Preparation. — Wash and scrub the truffles well 
with a hard brush ; they must be perfectly clean 
and free from soil or grit. Then soak them for a 
couple of hours in warm water.

404. TRUFFLES BAKED 

Take six large tra£9es, and having prepared them 
as above, wrap each separately in a buttered paper. 
Place in a hot oven, and let biJke for an hour at least. 
Remove the papers, drain the truffles, and serve in 
hot dish upon a serviette which has been warmed. 

405. TRUFFLES IN CROUSTADES 

Take some large truffles which have been soaked 
as above directed, peel and slice them thinly, and 
put them in a frying-pan with one or two ounces 
of fresh butter, according to quantity of truffles 
(five or six should sufflce). Add salt, pepper, and 
cayenne or paprika; and half a glass of sherry. 
Let them simmer quietly for thirty minutes, then 
moisten them with demi-glace or good gravy. 
Take a French roll and halve it lengthways, re- 
move the crumb, fry the crusts a light gold colour 
in butter. Then drain and fill them with the 
truffles ; serve on a hot dish. 



406. TRUFFLES A LTTALIENNB 

Take five or six good-sized truffles, peel thinly, 
slice finely, place in a frying-pan with one ounce of 
butter, one teaspoonful each of minced shallot and 
minced parsley, seasoning of salt and pepper. Fry 
for ten to fifteen minutes, turning the truffles that 
they may all be well done. Drain off the butter 
and add one ounce more, also two tablespoonfuls 
of demi-glace or rich gravy, one tablespoonful of 
lemon-juice, and a pinch of cayenne or paprika. 
Let cook over the fire till boiling-point ; then serve 
upon fried croustades of bread. B^hamel sauce 
can be poured over at discretion.

TURNIPS 

Note. — ^Turnips, like parsnips, carrots, beetroot, 
and other vegetables which figured continually in 
Roman m6nus, were unknown in England till the 
sixteenth century. Their human food-value is 
nothing like that of the above-named roots, especially 
parsnips, when cooked. A large percentage of water 
is included in the turnip, and if it is old enough to 
be tough and stringy, it is extra indigestible. The 
ordinary garden turnip has the more delicate flavour, 
but the orange-yellow swede turnip (chiefly used for 
fodder) is much more satisfying. 

Owing to the cheapness and ease with which 
turnips may be grown, even in poor and sandy soil, 
they have proved somewhat of a snare to slothful 
people. It is not so long ago since a tour through 
the agricultural districts of Su£Folk revealed the 
astounding fact that the labourers' wives fed their 
children, day in day out, on boiled turnips. Not 
to save money, so much as to save trouble. 

Preparation. — ^Turnips should be cooked and eaten 
when young. Having washed them and trimmed 
away any fibrous matter, place them, uncut, in 
boilbig salted water, and cook till tender — about 
twenty-five minutes. Serve whole, , with melted 
butter or white sauce. 

Older turnips will of course take longer to become 
tender. They should then be drained, mashed, 
and seasoned with pepper and salt. Place them in 
a stewpan, add a little milk or butter, stirring the 
mixture over the fire for about five minutes. Serve 
very hot. 

Kohl-rabi (which is a turnip-like vegetable) 
may be treated as above.

407. TURNIPS BOILED 

Take some sound white turnips ; peel, halve, and 
boil them in salted water. Drain and mash them ; 
add at least one tablespoonful of butter, the same 
of cream, and a little pepper. Arrange in a mound 
in a heated dish, and serve at once. 

408. TURNIP BALLS (POULETTE SAUCE) 

With a potato cutter cut out a pint of balls 
from large white turnips ; put over the fire in cold 
water, acidulated with one or two teaspoonfuls 
of lemon-juice or vinegar, and let cook for five 
minutes after boiling begins ; then drain, rinse in 
cold water, and cook until tender in chicken broth. 
Skim out the turnip balls and thicken the broth with 
one tablespoonful and a half each of butter and 
fiour, creamed together — there should be about 
one cup and half of broth ; let simmer ten minutes, 
then add the beaten yolks of two eggs, diluted with 
half a cup of cream. Season to taste with salt and 
white pepper ; add the balls, and let stand over hot 
water until very hot. A tablespoonful of lempn- 
juice improves this dish for some. If a French 
cutter be not at hand, cut the turnips in cubes of 
uniform size, or cut out cylinders with an apple- 
oorer, then cut these into half-an-inch lengths. 

409. TURNIP CHARLOTTE 

Cook slices of carrot and turnips a quarter of an 
inch thick until tender ; drain and use them to line 
a buttered charlotte mould. Boil white turnips 
until tender ; drain, and press through a fine sieve. 
To one cup of pur6e add a quarter of a teaspoonful 
of salt, a dash of white pepper, a grating of nutmeg, 
quarter of a cup of thick cream, and lastiy the stiff-

188 MAY BYRON'S VEGETABLE BOOK 

beaten whites of three eggs. Bake in the decorated 
mould, standing in a pan of water, until the centre 
becomes firm. Turn from the mould, and serve 
with velout6, white, or bechamel sauce. 

410. TURNIPS CHIPPED 

Boil turnips till almost cooked, then slice them 
thinly and fry them in butter. This makes a nice 
change, but is perhaps less digestible than plainly 
mashed turnips, served hot, with a little butter and 
pepper mixed in. 

411. TURNIPS IN CREAM 

Peel and slice the turnips ; blanch and cook until 
nearly tender in salted water. Drain and cut into 
cubes a quarter of an inch thick. Simmer ten or 
fifteen minutes in sweet cream. Season with salt, 
sugar, and white pepper ; add one or two tablespoon- 
fuls of butter, and shake the pan until the butter is 
blended with the other ingredients. Serve in a hot 
dish. 

412. TURNIP CROQUETTES 

Take some cold mashed turnips, and mix them 
with a quarter of their quantity of fi^e breadcrumbs, 
pepper and salt to taste, and one to two beaten ^gs 
according to the amount of turnip. Blend well, 
shape into croquettes, dip in egg and breadcrumbs, 
and fry in boiling dripping. 

413. TURNIPS GLAZED (SPANISH STYLE) 

Peel six white, medium turnips, and cut in 
quarters; place in a saucepan with an ounce of 
butter, half a teaspoonful of salt, half a teaspoonful 
of sugar, three saltspoonfuls of white pepper,' half

COOKED PLAINLY OR ELABORATELY 189 

a saltspoonful of safiFron, and two gills of white 
broth ; mix a little, cover pan, and set in oven for 
one hour, being careful to baste them with their 
own liquor once in a while ; pour into a vegetable 
dish, and serve. 

414. TURNIP FRITTERS 

Peel and boil some large turnips, having sliced 
them crossways. When they are nearly boiled, 
add a little salt. Drain the slices, dredge them with 
flour, and fry in a little butter. Dust them with a 
little granulated sugar, and let them become a nice 
brown on both sides ; then strew with salt and 
pepper, and serve. Use as little butter as possible. 

416. TURNIPS GLAZED 

Take some young turnips; Wash, thinly peel or 
scrape, and shape them like large olives. Put them 
into fast-boiling salted water for about eight minutes ; 
when they are parboiled, drain them, and dry them 
in a cloth. Put them in a shallow stewpan or frying- 
pan in which at least one ounce of butter has been 
melted, and dust them thickly with castor sugar. 
When they begin to brown over the fire, add a very 
little stock, salt and pepper to taste, and another 
sprinkling of sugar. Let them stew slowly till 
thoroughly tender. Place in a hot dish, and pout 
the liquid over them. 

416. TURNIPS MASHED, No. 1 

Boil some peeled and quartered turnips in a large 
saucepan of boiling salted water for about an hour 
and a half ; if tender, drain them, and squeeze with 
a plate to get out all the water ; pass them through 
a masher into a hot saucepan, with one ounce of 
butter, pepper and salt. Stir them until very hot 
and smooth. Dish them.

VEGETABLE MARROWS 

Note. — ^Vegetable marrows are fmits, if one is 
to be particiilarly accurate; but we usually class 
them amongst vegetables. Where is one to begin 
to differentiate ? They are absolutely unromantio 
objects. The lovely mellow colouring of gourd and 
squash has been denied to them : the slender elegance 
of cucumber is not theirs : they have neither the 
decorative outside nor the luscious inside of the 
melon. Of all the Cucurbitacece, they are the least 
attractive, and, so to speak, the poor relations of 
the family ; and yet they are homely, useful things : 
good in particular for " stuflSng," for frying, and 
for preserving. Their food-vsdue is a ne^igible 
quantity — ^they consist, I believe, of 90 per cent, 
of water. But if gathered and eaten quite young, 
with a decent sauce, they are delectable, if only 
as a variety. 

Preparation. — ^If the vegetable marrows are 
gathered really young and small, before the seeds 
are formed, they can be cooked and served whole, 
with beurre fondu or Sauce Hollandaise ; they can 
also be stewed in a closed earthenware jar in the 
oven, with plenty of butter and a little salt and 
pepper. When they are larger, they require to be 
peeled, halved, and the seeds removed ; they can I 

then be either cooked as they are, or stuffed with 
a filling. When they get very large, then, if I were 
you, I should not use them at all except for jam. 



426. VEGETABLE MARROW BOILED 

Boil a young marrow, entire and unpeeled, in 
boiling water for an hour and a half ; drain well ; 
serve entire. To be eaten with fresh butter, pepper, 
and salt.

COOKED PLAINLY OR ELABORATELY 193 

426. VEGETABLE MARROW BAKED 

Cut two small marrows (that have been par- 
boiled) into slices, and place them on a buttered 
pie-dish, which has been rubbed with garlic ; 
sprinkle the slices, first with cheese, then with 
breadcrumbs ; and, lastly, place a little butter 
over them. Bake for one hour in a hot oven. 

427. VEGETABLE MARROW FRIED 

Take a medium-sized vegetable marrow; peel it 
and boil in salted water till tender ; drain it, dry 
it, and cut in even slices, removing the seeds. Dip 
in beaten egg and breadcrumbs ; fry in boiling fat. 
Season with salt and pepper before serving. If a 
small marrow be used, cut it in quarters and pro- 
ceed as above. 

428. VEGETABLE MARROW AU GRATIN 

Take some very small marrows, slice them in 
rounds about a quarter of an inch thick, and lay 
them in a pie-dish. Pour tomato sauce over till 
they are hidden, then cover with breadcrumbs and 
grated cheese, and sprinkle little bits of butter over. 
Bake in a good oven until you find the marrow 
tender on trying it with a fork. 

429. VEGETABLE MARROW MOCK WHITEBAIT 

Parboil a medium-sized vegetable marrow, cut it 
up into slices about the size of whitebait, and roll 
these on a floured cloth ; get them as dry as possible. 
Have ready a pan of boiling oil, deep enough to 
cover the slices completely; fry them a golden 
brown. Drain them, pile them on a paper serviette, 
and serve them with sliced lemon (or scdad dressing) 
and bread-and-butter

430. VEGETABLE MARROW STEWED 

Cut up a large marrow into small pieces ; skin it, 
and take away the seeds ; fry the pieces with an 
onion cut in rings and a small clove of garlic. When 
slightly browned, put in a saucepan with enough 
stock to cover it, some button mushrooms, salt, 
and pepper. Let it simmer for an hour, thicken 
with flour, and serve. 



431. VEGETABLE MARROW STUFFED 

Cut off a thick slice from the top of a young 
marrow, and scoop out the seeds ; stuff the inside 
with any forcemeat most convenient (sausages free 
from skhi will do, or merely breadcrumbs and herbs). 
Bub a saucepan with a blade of garlic, and, when 
you have put on the top which was cut off the 
marrow, lay it carefully in the saucepan (it should 
only just fit), pour upon it half a pint of stock, and 
add herbs, pepper, salt, and a little bit of onion or 
a clove of garUc ; lastly, a tablespoonful of vinegar. 
Cover the saucepan closely, and let the marrow 
simmer slowly for two hours. Dish up carefully, 
and pour the sauce through a strainer over the 
marrow. 

432. VEGETABLE MARROW TART 

Take a small marrow, stew it quite tender, mash 
it up with butter and sugar to taste ; add a little 
flavouring of lemon-peel, spice, and ginger, and beat 
an egg-yolk well in. Make tartlets of puff-paste in 
patty-pans, or line a dish with puff-paste and, when 
the pastry is baked and has gone cool, fill it with 
above mixture, and put it back for a minute in the 
oven. The whipped white of egg can be laid on 
top if liked.

GOURDS AND PUMPKINS OR SQUASHES 

NoTB. — ^As these familiar fruits of the earth are 
all much of a muchness with vegetable marrows, 
I lump them together with the latter. Gourds 
are glorious to look upon, but nothing like so 
glorious to eat. Pumpkins, or squashes — the terms 
seem interchangeable — are really best when made 
into sweet dishes; but both they and gourds 
can be cooked in any way recommended for vege- 
table marrow. There is not very much flavour to 
the square inch in any of them, but the smaller 
and younger they are, the better they will be. A 
celebrity has said, that if every boy continued to 
develop as fast after six years old as he did before, 
he would be a coruscating genius at twenty. In- 
stead of which . . . But this goes to show that if 
you take your gourd or pumpUn young, it is worth 
having. Afterwards its coruscating genius is buried 
beneath mountains of too, too solid flesh. 

PreparcUian. — As for vegetable marrows. If very 
small, cook whole; if not, peel, remove seed and 
pulp, cut up into rings, cubes, or strips of desired 
size. 

433. PUMPKIN BAKED 

Cut up a smallish pumpkin into cubes an inch long, 
and dry them ; dredge them with flour, and put a 
layer of them in a buttered pie-dish ; add seasoning 
of salt and pepper, a little minced parsley and flnely 
chopped cluves, and sprinkle with good salad oil. 
Place another layer of pumpkin, and repeat season- 
ing as above. Bake in a moderate oven till tender. 
Pour off as much oil as you][can before serving. 

434. PUMPKIN BAKED AU GRATIN 
Cut up a young pumpkin into rounds about half 
an inch thick. Place these in a buttered pie-dish.

cover with tomato sauce, strew grated cheese over 
pretty thickly, then scatter breadcrumbs, with small 
bits of butter, on top. Bake in a moderate oven till 
the pumpkin is tender, which you can ascertain by a 
fork or skewer. 

436. PUMPKIN BOILED 

Take a young pumpkin, and boil it in boiling 
salted water about half an hour or longer ; drain 
and serve with a little butter in the dish, or with 
melted butter in a tureen. 

436. PUMPKIN MASHED 

Boil a young pumpkin, cut it open, and take out 
the seeds; mash the pulp with a little butter, 
season with pepper and salt, and serve very hot. 

437. PUMPKIN PUDDING 

Proceed as above ; place the mashed and seasoned 
pumpkin into a buttered basin, and bake in the 
oven with a cover over for half an hour ; turn out 
and serve with melted butter. 

438. PUMPKIN OR SQUASH STUFFED 

Take a half-grown squash, and simmer whole in 
water ten minutes. Cut them in halves, if small ; 
in quarters, if large. Scrape out the interior, leaving 
the shells, however, thick enough to handle without 
breaking up. Remove seeds, if large. Press all 
superfluous moisture out of the vegetable pulp, and 
add to it the following : to enough squash to serve 
six persons put one cup of dry breadcrumbs, one 
onion, and one tomato minced fine, one-fourth a clove 
of garlic, thyme, parsley, bay-leaf, two cups of shelled 
shrimps chopped fine, and two teaspoonfuls of lard. 
Fry the onion and shrimps lightly in the lard, and add 



Digitized by VnOOQ IC 



COOKED PLAINLY OR ELABORATELY 197 

to it the tomato and herbs. Into this torn the 
squash, which has been thoroughly mixed with the 
crumbs, also salt and pepper and a beaten egg. Turn 
over and over with a spoon, mixing it again and 
again. Let the whole cook for about ten minutes. 
Have the shells arranged in the baking-dish. Fill 
each, rounding nicely. Sprinkle with dry bread- 
crumbs, mixed with melted butter, and bake until 
brown. Serve hot. 

The squash may be heaped upon a pie-plate, and 
so baked without the shells. Crab, minced ham, 
veal — ^almost anything in fact which is savoury — 
may take the place of the shrimps. Egg-plant is 
stuffed in the same way, but needs a little longer 
boiling than squash. 

WATERCRESS 

Note. — ^This cheap and wholesome vegetable is 
usually served uncooked, alone or as a constituent of 
salads. But it can also be made into a palatable 
dish, and affords a welcome variety. 

PreparcUion. — Wash it well in several waters, see 
that any decayed leaves are removed, and that the 
leaves are perfectly free from insects ; be careful that 
it is all watercress, and that no poisonous brook- 
lime is mingled with it. 

439. WATERCRESS BOILED 
Having well washed the cress, and thoroughly 
picked it, chop it, not too small. Have ready in a 
lined pan one tablespoonful of butter and two 
ounces of flour, well mixed and lightly browned; 
add half a pint of thin stock, and let it boil up, 
stirring carefully ; add salt and pepper to taste, a 
little nutmeg, and a squeeze of lemon-juice ; then 
add the chopped watercress. Boil, and serve with 
fried crofltons.

440. WATERCRESS STEWED 

Wash the watercress in salted water, piok and 
clean it thoroughly, put it into boiling salted water, 
and let it stew ten to fifteen minutes. Drain it, 
chop it small, add a lump of butter and seasoning of 
salt and pepper, and let it get well reheated in the 
stewpan; give it a squeeze of lemon-juice, and 
serve on buttered toast. 



YAMS 

NoTB. — ^These are obtainable in England, but few 
people are acquainted with their excellence as a dish. 
They are tubers of different shapes, sizes, and 
colours, in shape mid-way between Jerusalem 
artichokes and sweet potatoes. They come from 
China and Japan, from India, Guinea, the West 
Indies, and other hot countries. Each locality 
respectively considers its own yam the best; but 
the white floury one is that most likely to oomm^id 
itself to the English cook. They make an interesting 
variety in the vegetable m^nu, and may be cooked 
in almost any way which is applicable to potatoes. 

PreparcUion, — ^As for potatoes and sweet potatoes 
(which see). 

441. YAMS BAKED 

Wash the yams, scrape them a little, but do not 
peel them. Set them in a hot oven till baked quite 
soft.

CHAPTER III 

CEREALS USED AS VEGETABLES 

Note. — This includes various preparations of 
wheat flour, such as macaroni and vermicelli ; 
maize or Indian-corn, and its preparations, such as 
hominy, semolina, etc. ; rice, that invaluable sub- 
stitute, to millions of people, for bread and potatoes ; 
barley, and other grains which, while not vegetables 
in the culinary sense, can be employed as such 
for the purposes of ordinary meals. I have not 
mentioned those cereals, such as oatmeal, etc., which 
are mainly used for breakfast dishes. 

BARLEY 

This extremely nourishing and palatable cereal 
is chiefly used in its prepared form known as pearl 
barley. In employing it as an addition to soup, 
broth, stews, etc., it is best when steeped first, 
according to the following directions, which will 
help to ^aw out its mucilaginous qualities, and to 
ensure its proper expansion. 

PreparcUion. — Place four tablespoonfuls of pearl 
barley in a quart jug, and pour in one pint of boiling 
water. Leave it at the side of the stove to steep 
for at least two hours, then boil it till it thickens 
slightly, and add it to hot milk ; or add it to soup, 
and let it boil up.

MACARONI 

Note. — Macaroni is made from wheat flour, and 
is remarkably nutritive. All the various kinds of 
macaroni require the same cooking, but some need a 
longer time than others. The stick macaroni should 
be broken into short piecesof even lengths and cooked 
in rapidly boiling salted water till tender, then 
drained and rinsed in cold water to separate the 
pieces ; then returned to the fire, along with the 
liquid in which it will be served, in a double-boiler, 
and cooked till most of the liquid is absorbed. 

444. MACARONI AND CHEESE BAKED 

Put cooked macaroni and grated cheese into a 
fireproof dish in alternate layers; cover with milk 
and let cook until the cheese is melted and the milk 
is partly absorbed. One or two beaten eggs may 
be added with the milk, and the whole baked slowly 
until the egg is set. 

445. MACARONI! AND CHEESE BOILED 

Half a pound of tomatoes, one tablespoonful of 
curry-powder, a quarter of a pound of macaroni, 
two ounces of butter, salt and pepper, two ounces 
of grated cheese. 

Boil macaroni for thirty minutes in boiling salted 
water. Drain it; scald the tomatoes. Peel and 
slice. Put butter in saucepan to melt ; add sliced 
tomatoes, and macaroni. Stir well together ; add 
I»nch of salt and curry-powder. Lastly stir in the 
grated cheese, with two forks. Cook for five minutes, 
then serve. 

446. BiACARONI AND CHEESE DEVILLED 

Take six to eight ounces of mac€troni, break it up 
small, place it in fast-boiling salted water. When

tender, remove and drain it. Place it in a battered 
pie-dish, and stir in one ounce of melted batter, two 
oances of grated cheese, two beaten yolks, half a 
saltspoonful each of salt and cayenne, and half a tea- 
spoonful of curry-powder. Pour a white sauce over, 
and strew the top with fine crumbs and a sprinkling 
of melted butter. Bake in a hot oven to a golden 
brown, and serve hot. 



447. MACARONI AND CHEESE A L'lTALIENNE 

Quarter of a pound of macaroni, two table- 
spoonfuls of butter, two tablespoonfuls of flour, 
one-fifth of a teaspoonful of salt, quarter of a tea- 
spoonful of pepper, half a cup of brown stock, half 
a cup of tomato pulp well reduced, quarter to half a 
cup of grated cheese. 

Make a sauce of the butter, flour, seasonings, stock, 
and tomato pulp — the tomato pulp should be quite 
thick from long cooking; add the macaroni, 
cooked till tender, in boiling salted water, rinsed and 
drained. Reheat in double-boiler, adding the cheese 
meanwhile. Serve when the cheese is melted and 
the whole very hot. 



448. BiACARONI AND CHEESE (GARNISH OF 
WELSH RABBIT) 

Half a pound of macaroni, quarter of a pound of

core removed before baking) ; dispose the macaroni 
in a wreath around the tomatoes, pour the cheese 
mixture over the whole, and serve very hot. 

464. MACARONI AND VEGETABLES 

Boil four ounces of macaroni in water till tender ; 
drain and cut into convenient lengths. Boil eight 
ounces of onions till rather more than three-parts 
cooked ; drain and slice them. Take eight ounces 
of tomatoes, dip them a minute into boiling water, 
then skin and slice them. Butter a pie-dish, dust 
it with fine breadcrumbs and grated cheese, with a 
sprinkling of finely minced parsley ; put a bottom 
layer of the macaroni, moistened with a little milk, 
and dusted with a little cheese and parsley ; then a 
layer of onions, and a layer of tomatoes, each 
similarly moistened and flavoured; finish up with 
a layer of macaroni. Stew this with four ounces of 
grated cheese, three ounces of breadcrumbs, a 
little minced parsley, and about one ounce of butter 
broken up small. Put into a hot oven for twenty 
minutes or so, to become nicely and evenly browned. 

466. VERMICELLI RISSOLES

oomparatively neglected, partly, no doubt, on acooant 
of its being only half-hi^y. It can be sown in the 
open, but is better raised in heat and hardened o£F. 
Whether green, ripe, or tinned, it makes a useful and 
succulent dish ; and in its various dried and ground 
forms it is a staple of many vegetarian commodities. 
There is a picturesque and stately air about maize 
in growth. Readers of Hiawaiha will remember 
the maize incarnate, in the shape of the young man 
Mondamin with his tassels, his plumage, his green and 
yellow garments. Even as its grains are much larger 
and of a different formation to those of other cere^, 
so, when cooked green, its taste is of a pleasant 
sweetness, quite unlike any other flavour one can 
recall. 

Prefparaiion. — Strip off the husk to the inner 
layer, and remove the '' silk '' ; then replace the inner 
layer, and tie it at the top end. In some cases, 
Bei>arate the grains from the cob ; but this is only 
necessary where indicated. Short thick ears are the 
best. 

466. MAIZE BOILED 

Prepare as above, and place in boiling water, not 
salted. Boil fast for at least fifteen minutes. Serve 
with butter, salt, and pepper, or with white sauce 
or Sauce HoUandaise. 

467. MAIZE BAKED, No. 1 

Prepare as above ; smear the cobs with softened 
butter, dust them with pepper and salt, place them 
in a baking-dish in a hot oven, turning and basting 
them so tlutt they may brown all over. 

468. MAIZE BAKED, No. 2

butter separately. 

46L MAIZE BOILED, No. 3 

Strip the grain from the young cob, and boil it like 
peas ; drain it, toss in some melted butter, salt, and 
pepper, and serve very hot, sprinkled with chopped 
pcuBley. When young green maize is not procur- 
able (though it can easily be grown as a garden 
vegetable), the tinned preparations called Succotash, 
and Wyndham Com, though more expensive, make 
useful dishes, and supply a change from hackneyed 
vegetables. 

462. MAIZE BOILED, No. 4 

Com on the cob is thought to be sweeter and 
better flavoured if it be cooked without disturbing 
the husk ; but as the removal of the silk and husk 
ia inconvenient after cooking it, it is quite customary

RICE 

Note.— When combined with eggs, cheese, milk, 
or meat juices, rice is an excellent food. The gr^ 
unpolished rice stocked by seed and grain shops is a 
more nutritious article than the husked and polished 
rice which grocers sell. 

PreparcUion. — There are several ways of cooking 
rice, each of which has points of merit. As a rule, 
rice-growing people prefer the rice-grain less tender 
than do those of northern climes, just as the Italians 
prefer macaroni in a state which by many would be 
called an underdone condition. But soft or not, 
all wish rice dry. The quantity of Uquid that the 
grain will absorb depends upon the variety of the 
rice, the season in which it was grown, the time it 
has been kept, and the liquid used. These things 
affect, also, the time of cooking. Rice will absorb 
in cooking from two and a half to four times its bulk 
of Uquid. When three cups of water would suflSoe, 
three and a half or four cups of milk or tomato pur6e 
are required. 

Rice needs to be thoroughly cleaned before cook- 
ing. It may be washed in several waters, being 
rubbed, meanwhile, between the hands, but the most 
satisfactory way is to blanch it. Put the rice over 
a hot fire in a large saucepan of cold water, and 
stir, occasionally, while it is heating ; let boil five 
minutes, then drain on a sieve and pass cold water 
from the tap through it. The rice is now beau- 
tifully white and dean, and the grains do not adhere 
to each other. \To cook, return to the fire, covered 
with the hot liquid, whatever this be, in which it 
is to be cooked ; let cook rapidly, until nearly all the 
liquid is absorbed, then finish cooking over hot 
water. If the liquid be milk, cook from the first, 
after blanching, in the double-boiler.

481. RICE BOILED, No. 1 

Wash the rioe thoroughly ; cook, in four times 
as muoh water, directly over the fire. Use a 
tightly covered saucepan, that the moisture or steam 
may be absorbed by the rice. Have the fire less 
brisk at the last part of the cooking than at first. 

482. RICE BOILED, No. 2 

C!over the blanched rice with a relatively large 
quantity of salted boiling water, and let cook 
rapidly in an uncovered saucepan until the grains

Boil a large cabbage ; drain it ; place it in a hot, 
dean saucepan ; add one teacupful of hot, boiled 
rice, pepper, salt, and a large piece of dripping ; 
mix and stir well on the fire, and serve very hot. 

Note. — ^This is a very favourite dinner with the 
peasants of Madeira. It is a very good accompani- 
ment to cold meat, and is very economical, as the . 
remains of either cold cabbage or cold rice can be 
used. It is best to cut the cabbage quite small 
before adding the rice. Cabbage should be boiled 
in two waters ; it is much more digestible.

CHAPTER IV 

SWEET FRUITS AND NUTS USED AS 
VEGETABLES 

NoTB. — ^By good rights, cucumbers, gourds, melons, 
pumpkins or squashes, tomatoes, and egg-plants 
should be included in this section. But it seems to 
me that this would be disconcerting to the ordinary 
housewife, and therefore I place apples, bananas, 
chestnuts, and olives by themselves, because one 
naturally thinks of them as a separate issue. 

The use of sweet fruits as an accompaniment to 
salt dishes is very old ; that of nuts as a substitute 
for meat is comparatively modem. Apple sauce 
with roast pork or goose is a time-honoured institu- 
tion ; so is cranberry sauce with turkey ; so is red 
currant jeUy with mutton or hare. It is probable 
that our forefathers largely extended this list, and 
mixed up sweet and salt in a way which would cer- 
tainly stagger their descendants. One has only t6 
read the m6nus of their dinners, to be convinced 
of their amazing latitude in this respect. But I 
think we tend to the other extreme, and might 
very well replenish our ideas and our tables with 
dishes such as those suggested below. 

APPLES 

NoTB. — Good sound cooking apples should be 
selected for culinary purposes; English ones have 
a flavour which no foreign ones possess, and I do not

SWEET FRUITS AND NUTS 223 

recommend American, Canadian, Tasmanian, or New 
Zealand apples for any of the uses indicated below. 

502. APPLES BAKED 

Select medium-sized cooking apples, as even as 
possible in size ; wipe and bake them in a pie-dish, 
just covered with water, till they are tender, but not 
broken. Serve with boiled beef, as though they 
were onions. This is a favourite Spanish method. 

503. APPLES FRIED 

Peel and core some good-sized sound apples ; cut 
each in four equal slices, dip in milk, lightly roll in 
flour, fry in boiling fat for five minutes ; drain and 
serve. These are excellent with broiled steaks, 
sausages, or fried eggs. Two tablespoonfuls of lard 
will suflSce to fry three apples, cooking them at 
least two minutes on each side. 

504. APPLES SCALLOPED 

Peel and core some cooking apples; cut each in 
eight equal slices. Cover the bottom of a buttered 
pie-dish with them. Strew over them one table- 
spoonful of fine crumbs, a little salt, a dust of 
cinnamon, a teaspoonful of brown sugar. Repeat 
until the dish is full ; finally let the top be crumbs. 
Cover it with another pie-dish of same size, bake 
thirty minutes in hot oven, then bake a quarter 
of an hour longer, uncovered. Serve hot with ducks, 
pork, or goose. 

BANANAS 

Note. — Only green bananas, or those by no means 
ripe, should be employed for these dishes. The 
ripe banana is much too sweet, as well as too soft ; 
and of the over-ripe banana it may be said that it

224 MAY BYRON'S VEGETABLE BOOK 

courts ill-health and internal afflictions. Cooked 
bananas are exceedingly nutrient and (to most 
people) digestible, and as a change will be always 
welcome. 



605. BANANAS BOILED 

Green bananas are best for this purpose. Take 
six good-sized ones, peel and slice them lengthways 
or across, lay them in a stewpan with one cupful of 
milk and seasoning of salt and pepper, and let them 
simmer slowly, but without stopping, for about half 
an hour. Heat half an ounce of butter in a 
shallow pan, add two teaspoonfuls of flour, brown 
slightly ; stir in the liquor from the bananas, let all 
come to the boil, then pour it over the bananas laid 
in a hot dish. 

606. BANANAS CURRIED 

Place half a cupful of grated coconut and half 
a pint of milk in a bowl, and leave it covered up for 
an hour. Put two tablespoonfuls of butter into a 
stewpan and beat up ; fry one tablespoonful of 
curry-powder in it ; add to this sis green bananas, 
peeled and cut in slices ; season with salt and 
cayenne; add one teaspoonful of Worcester sauce, 
and strain in to the rest the milk from the coconut. 
Simmer gently for fifteen minutes ; beat up an ^g 
and stir in ; let all thicken, and serve on a hot dish 
inside a border of rice like other curries. 

607. BANANAS FRIED 

Peel and cut two sound bananas into quarter-of- 
an-inch square cubes. Make a tablespoonful of 
butter thoroughly hot in a frying-pan, and fry the 
bananas brisUy for three minutes, tossing them 
light. These are a good accompaniment to scrambled

SWEET FRUITS AND NUTS 226 

eggs, boiled spinach, eto. Season with salt and 
pepper. 

Bananas may also be fried out in lengthwise 
strips. 

CHESTNUTS 

NoTB. — ^It is a pity that the food- value of chest- 
nuts is not more generally recognised. They are, 
as Evelyn said, '' exceedingly nutritive, a robust 
food." The roasted chestnuts of the London streets 
are the only common form in which this excellent 
product is encountered; but in Southern Europe 
they are appreciated at their real worth, and vege- 
tarian depots have helped to popularise both 
chestnuts and chestnut flour. They make a most 
appetising dish, plain boiled, with white sauce, as 
an accompaniment to baked meat; but with a 
little extra trouble all manner of wholesome, 
savoury, and satisfying concoctions may be made. 

Preparation. — ^For boiling, slightly nick or slit each 
outer skin or shell so as to enable its easy removal 
after cooking. For roasting, leave them as they are. 
For stewing, remove the outer shell, and place the 
chestnuts in boiling water, as you would almonds, 
till the inner skin is removable. For sweetened 
dishes, the chestnuts must be boiled, shelled, 
skinned, and rubbed through a sieve, or chestnut 
meal can be used to save time. 

508. CHESTNUTS BOILED, No. 1 

An excell^it variety in " second vegetables " can 
be made by putting one pound of chestnuts into 
salted boiling water, letting them cook fast until 
tender, then peeling and serving, masked in white 
sauce. A slight incision should be made in each 
chestnut husk before cooking. 

15

226 MAY BYRON'S VEGETABLE BOOK 

609. CHESTNUTS BOILED, No. 2 

Cut one pound of chestnuts half-way down each 
side from the thin end ; put them into a saucepan 
of boiling salted water, and boil them fast for 
twenty minutes; drain them as you would pota- 
toes, and serve in their skins. At table they are 
eaten with butter and salt. 

510. CHESTNUTS AND BRUSSELS SPROUTS 

Boil some chestnuts in water for two hours; 
remove the peel. Boil some sprouts for half an 
hour, strain them well, be earful not to break 
them. Have ready a frying-pan with hot beef 
dripping or butter; put in both chestnuts and 
sprouts and keep moving until the fat is absorbed 
(do not brown), then serve. 

61 L CHESTNUT CAKES (FREED) 

Take one poimd of chestnuts and cut a small 
piece out of each. Place them in fast-boiling salted 
water for thirty minutes; drain, peel, and rub 
them through a sieve; add one beaten ^g, two 
tablespoonfuls of milk, two ounces of butter, one 
teaspoonful of Worcester sauce, and seasoning of 
salt and pepper. Mix well and roll out ; cut into 
small roimd cakes, which must be dipped in ^g and 
breadcrumbs and fried in boiling lard or dripping. 
Drain and serve hot. 

612. CHESTNUTS GLAZED 

Slit thirty large Italian chestnuts and set in oven 
on a tin for twenty minutes. Remove, shell and 
peel, and place in a saucepan with half a pint of 
broth ; cover with water, add blade of mace, two 
branches of celery, one onion with a clove stuck in 
it, half a teaspoonful of salt, and two saltspoonfula

SWEET FRUITS AND NUTS 227 

of pepper. Cover pan, let hoil for twenty-five 
minutes; lift up chestnuts and place in saucepan 
with half a gill of demi-glace, half a gill of the 
chestnut broth, half an ounce of butter, the juice 
of half a lemon, and a saltspoonful of grated 
nutmeg. Set the pan ih oven for twenty-five 
minutes, being very careful to frequently baste 
chestnuts with the liquor; remove, and use as re- 
quired. 

613. CHESTNUTS MASHED 

Shell one poimd of chestnuts, plunge them in 
boiling water so that the skins can be ecisily re- 
moved. Have ready a good half-pint of salted 
boiling water, or stock, thickened with one tea- 
spoonful of fiour, and boil the chestnuts in this till 
tender ; then strain off the liquid and mash the 
chestnuts with butter, pepper, and salt. A little 
cream is an improvement. 

614. CHESTNUTS AND RICE 

Fry two onions and two tomatoes in a sauce- 
pan with some dripping ; add one quart of stock 
seasoned with herbs, pepper, and salt. When it 
boils, add to it half a pound of skinned chestnuts 
and one teacupful of rice. Stir until the chestnuts 
and rice are done — about half an hour* 

Note. — The best way of peeling chestnuts is to 
cut them as in the preceding recipe, and plunge 
them into boiling water for a few minutes. 

615. CHESTNUT SAVOURY 

Boil the chestnuts till tender, remove their skins, 
lay them on hot buttered toast ; season with pepper 
and salt and a dust of nutmeg. Have ready a rich 
thick parsley sauce, and pour over the chestnuts 
and toast ; serve very hot.

616. CHESTNUT TIMBALES 

Slit on one side twenty-five good-sized, sound 
Italian chestnuts ; place on tin and roast in oven for 
twenty minutes. Remove, shell, and place them in 
small saucepan with enough milk to just cover ; add 
three saltspoonfuls of salt, cover pan, let boil until 
nearly dry, then place in a mortar and pound to 
fine piilp. Remove, press through sieve into a 
saucepan ; add two egg-yolks, two saltspoonfuls of 
salt, a saltspoonful each of cayenne and grated 
nutmeg, and briskly stir while heating on fire 
for five minutes. Lightly butter six small tin 
moulds, fill up with the chestnuts, place on 
a tin, pour hot water in up to half the height of 
moulds ; set in oven for twenty minutes, remove ; 
unmould, and use as directed. 



VARIOUS 

617. SALTED DEVILLED ALMONDS 

Shell half a pound of fine large almonds, then 
plunge them in a quart of boiling water, with half a 
teaspoonful of salt, for four minutes. Drain on a 
sieve ; neatly peel and wipe dry on a cloth. Lightly 
butter a pie-plate, place the almonds in the plate, and 
set in a moderate oven for ten minutes, occasionally 
turning them over with a wooden spoon meanwhile. 
Pour over them one tablespoonful of very hot 
melted butter, repeatedly turn them with the 
spoon, sprinkle a light teaspoonful of fine salt and 
a saltspoonful of cayenne pepper over them, lightly 
mix again ; return them to the oven, and roast for 
twenty minutes, or until they are of a nice golden 
colour, being very careful to mix them frequently 
with the wooden spoon. Remove from the oven, 
drop them on a clean towel to drain, dredge over a

SWEET FRUITS AND NUTS 229 

teaepoonful of salt and one light ealtspoonful of 
cayenne pepper, then briskly sha^e them in a folded 
cloth or tin can. Dress on a glass dish, with a fancy 
paper over it, and serve hot. 

518. STUFFED OLIVES WITH CHEESE 

Stone carefully twelve large olives. Place in a 
bowl half an ounce of cream or Neufchatel cheese, 
two saltspoonfuls of salt, one saltspoonful of cayenne 
pepper, half a teaspoonful of chopped parsley, and 
one teaspoonful of anchovy essence. Mix well 
with a wooden spoon into a smooth paste, and 
with it fill the twelve stoned olives. Place them on 
a hors-cTctuvre dish, and serve. 

619. WALNUT PIE 

Line the bottom of a buttered baking-dish with 
hot mashed potatoes, and over these put a layer of 
four ounces of shelled walnuts, grated ; season with 
salt and pepper. Take a quarter of a pint of good 
stock and a quarter of a pint of mushroom ketchup ; 
heat and thicken it, pour over the walnuts ; place a 
top layer of mashed potatoes, add a few small bits 
of butter, and bake to a golden brown. 

620. WALNUT SAVOURY 

Mix thoroughly one breakfastcupful each of grated 
breadcrumbs, grated cheese, and grated walnuts. 
Moisten with a little stock or water. Stir in a 
teaspoonful of chopped parsley and two teaspoonfuls 
of lemon-juice; add salt and pepper. Bake in a 
shallow dish.

CHAPTER V 

COMBINATIONS OF VEC^ETABLES 

Note. — ^These economical and wholesome dishes are 
but little used in Britain, compared to their popu- 
larity in other countries. The chief point about 
them is that they shall be cooked to a nicety, every 
v^etable ingredient being exactly right, neither 
underdone nor pulpy. This, of course, means 
particularly careful cookery. The seasoning and 
flavouring of these preparations is also of the utmost 
importance, as is their appearance when dished. 
If they are allowed to become an indistinguishable 
parti-coloured mass, a " fortuitous concourse of 
atoms," they will not present an appetising aspect ; 
but, well prepared, they will be acclaimed with 
much admiration. 

521. CABBILOW 

Mash boiled potatoes and boiled cabbages to- 
gether, mixing with them slices of onions, and 
sprinkling the mess with pepper and salt, to which 
should be added a little butter or dripping. The 
dish is improved by being put into a Dutch oven 
to be browned, like mashed potatoes. 

622. COLCANNON 

Boil separately an equal amount of potatoes and 
of fresh cabbage ; about half the amount of onions. 
Mash all very finely, mix in a little butter or drip-

ping, with salt and pepper, put in a buttered bowl, 
and bake, well covered up. Serve very hot. 

623. COMBINATION OF VEGETABLES 

Remove the stalks, leaves, and silk from three 
soimd ears of green maize ; place in a saucepan with 
a quart of water, a gill of milk, and a teaspoonful of 
salt, and boil for twenty-five minutes, then drain ; 
with the back of a knife-blade detach the grains 
from the cobs, avoiding as much as possible the 
fibres, and keep them on a plate ; add half a pint of 
cookaigreen peas to the com, and place with the rest. 
Heat an ounce of butter in a frying-pan, add the 
three articles ; season with half a teaspoonful of salt, 
two saltspoonfuls of pepper, and a saltspopnful of 
grated nutm^ ; fry for ten minutes, lightly tossing 
them once in a while, then add half a teaspoonful 
of chopped chives. Toss well while heating for two 
minutes. Dress on a v^etable dish, and serve. 

624. CHIPOLATA 

Blanch two dozen of carrots, two dozen of turnips, 
the same quantity of large chestnuts and onions ; 
let these stew for some time over the fire, with some 
consomm6 and a little sugar. Having fried separ- 
ately a dozen sausages and a dozen slices of bacon, 
add them, with two dozen button mushrooms and a 
few spoonfuls of Espagnole sauce, to the v^etables, 
adding from time to time a little consomm6 or 
gravy. These are to stew for an hour. 

625. BRUSSELS SPROUTS WITH TOMATOES 

Cook the sprouts in fast-boiling salted water. 
Drain and heap them in the centre of a hot dish. 
Have some macaroni boiled tender (about four 
ounces of macaroni to one pound of sprouts is 
sufficient^ but the exact quantities are a matter of

taste). Prepare some tomato sauce, by trying a 
sliced onion in one ounce of butter, and adding 
half a pint of stock, four quartered tomatoes, one 
ounce of flour. Mix well, boil all together ; strain 
through, a sieve; add pepper and salt to your 
liking, and a dash of lemon-juice * then put the 
macaroni on top of the sprouts, and cover all with 
the sauce. Care must be taken to keep the sprouts 
and macaroni hot, separately, while the sauce is 
being mcde. 



52(J. CARROTS WITH ONIONS 

Take six medium-sized carrots ; clean and boil 
them. When they are nearly cooked, pour oflE the 
water, and chop the carrots into small dice. Mean- 
while, have ready six small onions, which have been 
nearly cooked, and the water poured oflE. Put the 
carrots with the onions, and add just enough broth 
to cover them (about one brealdastcupful should 
suflSce). Season with salt and pepper, and one tea- 
spoonful of chopped parsley. Simmer gently till 
the vegetables are quite tender. 

527. CARROTS AND PEAS 

Cut the stems off and scrape twelve small new 
carrots. Heat a tablespoonful of melted butter in 
a saucepan, add one finely sliced onion, and brown

oval rissole ; make each end flat instead of roimded, 
and mark off a certain portion of the centre for 
subsequent removal. This rissole must be dipped 
in egg and breadcrumbs, and fried a nice gold colour. 
Take out (whole) sufficient of the centre to make 
room for the following : a few boiled sprouts, a 
few turnips and carrots cut into small baUs ; each 
coated with a good sauce. Replace the potato lid, 
and serve at once.

lining of a mould, as closely as yon can get them to 
fit. Put in the following : any cold cooked peas or 
beans, one small cooked cold cauliflower broken up 
very small, any odds and ends of cooked meat or 
ham finely minced, seasoning of salt and pepper, 
and two breakfastcupfuls of thick parsley sauce. 
Minced shallot is an improvement. Cut a round of 
fried bread to cover the top entirely, and set in a

well heated through. 

638. VEGETABLE CURRY, No. 1 

Cut onions into thin slices, and fry a good brown 
in butter ; add breakfastcupful of milk in which a 
teaspoonful of curry has been mixed. Let all boil 
together for twenty minutes, stirring the whole 
time; then add the vegetables — ^previously par- 
boiled — ^and let all simmer for an hour. Potatoes, 
peas, beans, carrots, and turnips may be used. 
Broad beans alone make a delicious curry. 

539. VEGETABLE CURRY, No. 2 

Take some boiled and sliced carrots and turnips, 
some cooked peas, French beans, little squares of 
cooked vegetable marrow, some cauliflower or 
broccoli — ^in fact, any cold, cooked vegetables which 
may be to hand. Place them in a stewpan with a 
little clarified dripping, and put on the edge of the 
stove, so that the dripping may be melting and the 
vegetables warming, while the curry sauce is pre- 
pared. For the sauce, fry two sliced onions in 
clarified fat, then mix with them one dessertspoonful 
of curry-powder, and fry for two minutes. Pour 
into the stewpan three-quarters of a pint of stock 
and cook until the onion is quite tender. Mix one 
dessertspoonful of arrowroot with some milk to a 
paste; stir into the sauce, and simmer for eight

of mixed milk and water ; then add two potatoes 
boiled and mashed, one saltspoonful of mace, about 
one teaspoonful of pulped onion or onion-juice. 
Mix all pretty stiff, and spread it out to cool, about 
one inch thick. When cold, cut it in slices, bread- 
crumb and fry it, and serve yrith a sharp sauce. 

642. VEGETABLE GOOSE 

Soak half a poimd of breadcrumbs in cold water, 
squeeze them nearly dry, and mash them. Mix in 
one onion chopped small, one teaspoonful of chopped 
parsley and herbs, one ounce of butter, pepper and 
salt. Place mixture in a buttered dish, and bake 
in a good oven for about one hour. 

643. VEGETABLE PIE 

Required : one onion, one carrot, one turnip, one 
stick of celery, one handful of shelled green peas 
(if in season), half an ounce of sago, one ounce of

COMBINATIONS OF VEGETABLES 239 

butter, pepper and salt, pie-crast. Cut all the 
vegetables small, and stew them with the sago and 
butter in a very litUe water until nearly cooked; 
then put them in a pie-dish, cover with crust, and 
bake about half an hour. Any other vegetables 
may be used at pleasure. Mushrooms are always 
an improvement. 

544. VEGETABLE SOUFFLE 

Have two good-sized carrots boiled or steamed 
till tender ; pass them through a sieve. Add one 
large steamed potato, sieved ; place in a pan over 
the fire, and add two tablespoonfuls of butter, 
one tablespoonful of flour mixed to a smooth paste 
with milk, one tablespoonful of minced parsley, 
seasoning of salt and pepper. When all the in- 
gredients are thoroughly blended, stir in three 
beaten yolks. Remove from the fire to cool off, 
then add four whites whisked stiff. Take a but- 
tered tin mould, dust it with very fine crumbs or 
raspings ; put the mixture in, strew the top with 
raspings and melted butter, and bake in a mod- 
erate oven.

CHAPTER VI 

VEGETABLE CREAMS AND PXJREES 

Note. — ^As Soups do not come within the scope of 
this book (being separately considered in the Soup 
Book), I include here some y^etable creams and 
pur^y which are singularly nutritious and appe- 
tising. Purees should not be served as soups, but 
as y^etables, so to speak, in a liquefied form. Their 
thic^ess is not derived from flour or roux, but from 
the actual v^etable ingredient which has be^i 
employed, delicately cooked and passed through a 
sieve. For convalescents, children, old people, and 
persons of weak digestion, no better way of treating 
v^etables can be found. 

Creams and bisques more nearly approximate to 
the conventional soup ; they are chiefly prepared 
by adding a vegetable pulp (or meat or fish pulp) 
to a thin white sauce. As the pulp will otherwise 
settle to the bottom of the dish instead of blend- 
ing evenly with the liquid, a thickening of corn- 
flour, arrowroot, or tapioca is usuaUy added, also 
yolks of eggs. 

All these preparations necessitate much care and 
trouble ; but the purees are the most easily made 
and probably the most satisfying, for which reason I 
have relegated the majority of creams and bisques 
to the Soup Book. 

546. ARTICHOKES, CREAM OF 

Peel and wash well in cold water twenty-fonr 
medium, sound Jerusalem artichokes; place them 

240

VEGETABLE CREAMS AND PUREES 241 

in a saucepan with half -sliced carrot, half -sliced 
onion, two well-cleaned sliced leeks, one sliced stalk 
of celery, one chopped branch of fresh parsley, one 
quart of broth or water, one quart of milk. Sea- 
son with a teaspoonful of salt, one saltspoonful of 
cayenne pepper, and one saltspoonful of grated 
nutm^. Cover the pan and let slowly boil for 
thirty minutes. 

Have in a saucepan one ounce of melted butter 
and two ounces of flour. Stir well while heating 
for one minute. Strain the artichokes, etc., through 
a gravy strainer into this saucepan and briskly 
whisk for two minutes ; as soon as it comes to a 
boil, add one gill of cold cream and half an ounce of 
good butter ; whisk briskly for two minutes, then 
strain the cream through a cheesecloth into a hot 
Boup tureen and serve with a plate of bread croutons 
separately. 

546. ARTICHOKE SOUFFLE 

Take some Jerusalem artichokes, boil until they 
are soft enough to press through a sieve; season 
with salt and pepper. Have ready a custard made 
with two yolks and half a pint of milk, then add two 
whisked whites, and mix with the artichoke. Place 
in a mould, and steam for one hour. A tomato 
pur6e may be served with this. 



547. ASPARAGtJS, CREAM OF 

Heat one tablespoonful of melted butter in a 
medium-sized saucepan, then add a pint of drained 
tinned asparagus tips, keeping the liquor, and 
gently cook on the fire for ten minutes, occasionally 
mixing meanwhile ; pour in the liquor of the aspara- 
gus and two quarts of hot water ; add one sliced 
white onion, two cloves, one saltspoonful of thyme, 

16

242 MAY BYRON'S VEGETABLE BOOK 

one bay-leaf, and two branches of parsley. If any 
clean raw chicken bones are at hand, add them. 
Season with two teaspoonfols of salt, half a tea- 
spoonful of sugar, two saltspoonfuls of cayenne 
pepper, and one saltspoonful of grated nutmeg. 
Cover the pan and let gently simmer for forty 
minutes. Dilute in a bowl five tablespoonfuls of 
rice-flour with one egg-yolk and one pint of milk, 
and add to the broth. Mix well with a wooden 
spoon while cooking for five minutes. Remove, 
strain the cream through a fine sieve, then through 
cheesecloth into a hot soup tureen, and serve with 
a plate of fried bread croiltons. 

548. CELERY, CREAM OF 
Trim off aU the green parts of three heads 
of celery. Cut them up in very small pieces, 
then thoroughly wash in fresh water and drain 
well on a sieve. Place the celery in a medium- 
sized pan with half a sliced carrot, two sliced leeks, 
and one medium, sliced white onion. Moisten with 
two quarts of cold water. Season with a light 
tablespoonful of salt and a teaspoonful of white 
pepper ; if any chicken or veal bones are at hand, 
add them to the saucepan. Cover the pan and let 
boil rather slowly for forty-five minutes ; strain the 
broth into a basin and keep hot. 

Place all ingredients except the bones in a mortar, 
and pound to a paste, then add to the strained 
broth. Heat one ounce of melted butter in a 
saucepan, pour in two and a half ounces of sifted 
flour; bri^y stir with a wooden spoon for two 
minutes, then drop in the celery broth ; mix 
lightly while cooking for five minutes ; add a pint 
of good hot milk, one gill of cream, half an ounce of 
good butter, and one saltspoonful of grated nutmeg ; 
mix well with a wooden spoon until it comes to a 
boiling-point, then add one gill of cream. Mix well

while heating for two minutes, but do not allow to 
boil again. Pass the cream through a small sieve, 
then through a gravy strainer into a hot soup 
tureen, and serve. 

549. BEANS (HARICOT), PUREE OF, No. 1 

Steep one pint of haricot beans in cold water 
overnight; in the morning put them into a pan 
holding two quarts of cold water, with a sliced onion 
and one teaspoonful of salt. Boil them slowly for 
four hours, then strain through a colander; add 
one pint of milk, season to taste with salt and 
pepper, and reheat in a saucepan, stirring so that 
the pur^e does not ** stick " or bum. Serve very 
hot. 

560. BEANS (HARICOT), PUREE OF, No. 2 

Boil as above after soaking all night. Pcuss them 
through the masher to free them from their skins; 
add some butter, a Uttle lemon-juice, pepper and 
salt. Place in a saucepan \0th a small quantity of 
stock. Serve very hot. 

661. BEANS (WHITE), PUREE OF 

Soak a pint of white beans overnight ; drain, place 
in a saucepan with half a pound piece of salt pork, 
one carrot cut in quarters, one white onion with 
two cloves stuck in, two branches of parsley, half 
a teaspoonful of salt, half a teaspoonful of pepper, 
and one quart of water. Oover pan, boil thirty 
minutes, then set in oven one hour. Remove, free 
beans from all the ingredients, then press through 
a sieve into another saucepan ; add half an ounce of 
good butter, and mix well with wooden spoon while 
heating for four minutes; remove, and use as re- 
quired.

662. CAULIFLOWER, PUREE OF, No. 1 

For this a loose, overblown cauliflower will serve 
rather better than a firm one. Clean the flower 
part, put it into fast-boiling salted water for ten 
minutes, then remove and drain it. Have ready 
the following preparation in a stewpan : one minced 
onion, one ounce of minced bacon, one ounce of 
butter, lightly fried; add one tablespoonful of 
flour, a little salt, and one pint of stock, and go on 
stirring till it boils ; then add the cauliflower. Let 
all simmer gently for half an hour, then pass through 
a sieve, and put back in the stewpan to heat throu^. 
A little more stock, and a tablespoonful or so of 
boiled milk, may be added now to thin the pur^e if 
desired. 

663. CAULIFLOWER, PUREE OF, No. 2 

Remove the outer leaves and thoroughly wash a 
large head of white cauliflower without cutting off 
the stalk. Place in a saucepan with three quarts of 
water, quarter of a pint of milk, and a teaspoonful 
of salt, and let boil for fifty minutes. Lift up and 
thoroughly drain, then press through a sieve into a 
small saucepan; add one ounce of good butter, 
two saltspoonfuls of salt, one saltspoonful of cayenne 
pepper, and a saltspoonful of grated nutm^ ; mix 
while heating for five minutes ; remove, and use aa 
required. 

664. CHESTNUTS, PUREE OF 

Slit on one side thirty-six good-sized, sound 
Italian chestnuts and plunge them in boiling water 
for ten minutes. Drain and peel them. Place in 
a small saucepan with two and a half gills of cold 
water ; season with half a teaspoonful of salt and 
two saltspoonfuls of white pepper. Cover the pan,

boil for a minute, then set in the oven for thirty- 
five minutes. Remove, place the whole in a mortar, 
and pound to a smooth paste. Press through a 
sieve into a small saucepan, add one saltspoonful 
of grated nutmeg, half an ounce of butter, and two 
tablespoonfuls of cream. Mix well, heat for two 
minutes, and serve. 



666. CHESTNUT PUREE, SAVOURY 

Take half a pound of large chestnuts, slit each a 
little, put into salted boiling water. Boil twenty 
minutes, or until the shell and skins can be easily 
removed; having done this boil again in a little 
stock, and when quite soft, pass through a fine 
sieve. Add salt and pepper, and just enough brown 
sauce, tomato sauce, or good rich gravy to make 
a smooth paste when thoroughly mixed. Re-heat 
a minute, and serve. 

666. CUCUMBERS, PUREE OF 

Peel four medium, sound, ripe cucumbers, cut in 
quarters, remove spongy parts; place in a sauce- 
pan with a pint of broth and half a teaspoonful of 
salt. Cover pan and boil thirty minutes. Thor- 
oughly drain, then rub through wire sieve into a 
bowl. 

Mix in a saucepan a tablespoonful of melted 
butter with a tablespoonful and a half of flour ; beat 
for half a minute ; add a gill of cream, sharply stir 
until it comes to a boil, then add pur6e with three 
saltspoonfuls of salt, a saltspoonful of cayenne, half 
an ounce of butter, and sharply stir while heating 
five minutes. Remove, dress the pur6e on a v^e- 
table dish, and neatly smooth both sides to a dome 
shape ; arrange six heart-shaped crofitons around, 
and serve.

557. CHICORY, PUREE OF 

Bemove stalks and any stale leaves from four 
small heads of chicory; thoroughly wash, drain 
on a sieve, plunge into a quart of boiling water 
with a teaspoonful each of salt and sugar, and let 
boil for thirty-five minutes. Drain on a sieve, press 
all water out with a skimmer, then finely chop it. 
Place it in a small saucepan with an ounce of good 
butter, three saltspoonfuls of salt, half a teaspoon- 
ful of sugar, and two saltspoonfuls of pepper. Stir 
well on the fire while heating for five minutes ; re- 
move, and use as directed. 

568. CUMBERLAND PUREE 

Peel and slice sound apples and bananas, five 
of each ; place in saucepan with half an ounce of 
butter, a tablespoonful of sugar, two tablespoonfuls 
of currant jelly, half a teaspoonful of salt, and a 
saltspoonful of cayenne. Mix well, and cook on fire 
for twenty-five minutes, frequently stirring mean- 
while ; press through sieve into a bowl, dress on a 
vegetable dish, and serve. 

559. MUSHROOMS, PUREE OF 

Take one pound of sound, fresh mushrooms ; peel, 
trim, and remove stidks. Place the stalks and 
trimmings in a saucepan, with seasoning of salt and 
pepper, and sufficient water barely to cover them ; 
let this boil, and then simmer for a quarter of an 
hour. Strain off the liquid, and add it to the mush- 
rooms in a lined pan, with a little over a gill of 
fresh milk and another slight seasoning of salt and 
pepper. Let this boil, and then sinmier for a quarter 
of an hour ; then remove pan from fire, and let the 
contents grow cool in it. Lift out the mushrooms 
with a skimmer, leaving aU the liquid in the pan ; 



Digitized by VnOOQ IC 



VEGETABLE CREAMS AND PUREES 247 

dry them carefully, and pass them through a sieve, 
along with half an ounce of fresh butter. Strain 
off the mushroom liquor, add a pint of good brown 
sauce, and stir it in a double-boiler over the fire till 
it thickens, when the pur6e must be gently stirred 
in. 



6«0. POTATO PUREE 

Take one dozen potatoes, peel and slice them; 
slice up two onions, one head of celery, and the 
white part of two leeks. Saut^ these in four ounces 
of butter for ten minutes; and three cloves, salt 
to taste, a little parsley, and two quarts of veal 
broth. Cook imtil the potatoes are tender, then 
pass all through a fine sieve. Return to the fire, 
and let simmer for twenty minutes ; if the pur6e'be 
too thick, more stock can be added. Just before 
serving, add three beaten yolks of eggs, half a cup- 
ful of cream, and two ounces of butter broken very 
small. A little chopped chervil may be sprinkled 
over at discretion. 



561. SORREL, PUREE OP 

Remove the stalks and also all stale leaves, if 
any adhering, then thoroughly wash in three different 
changes of cold water two quarts of very fresh 
sorrel; lift it up with the hands and drain well. 
Heat half an oimce of butter in a small saucepan 
and add the sorrel; season with a taaspoonful of 
salt, half a teaspoonful of white pepper, and a 
tablespoonful of fine sugar. Cover the pan, and 
gently cook on a moderate fire for ten minutes, 
lightly mixing once in a while; drain off all the 
water, then press the sorrel through a small sieve 
into a bowl ; add a few bits of butter, mix well with 
a wooden spoon, and serve as required.

562. TOMATOES, PUREE PAKMENTIER AUX 

Cut up four or five medium-sized and very mealy 
potatoes with two small carrots, one pound of ripe, 
well-coloured tomatoes, and a small head of celery. 
Put into a pan two ounces of well-clarified beef 
dripping, and as soon as this is melted put in the 
tomatoes and a medium-sized onion finely slioed 
and let all cook in the covered pan for twdve to 
fifteen minutes, after which pour in three pints of 
stock (or water), together with the potatoes, celery, 
etc., and seasoning to taste, and let simmer gently 
till the vegetables are in a pulp ; then rub it through 
a sieve, reheat, add a spoonful or so of cream, and 
serve with fried croutons. 



563. TURNIPS, PUREE OF 

Scrub and pare about six white turnips. Cut 
them into slices, cover with cold water, and bring 
quickly to the boiling-point. Drain and blanch by 
rinsing in cold water, then cover with salted boiling 
water and cook until tender. Drain and turn into 
a cloth, and wring out the moisture. Pass through 
a sieve, then return to the fire to heat. Melt three 
tablespoonfuls of butter, cook in this two table- 
spoonfuls of flour, and, when frothy, add the turnip 
and quarter of a cupful of thick cream with salt and 
pepper. Stir constantly until the mixture boils, then 
turn into the serving-dish. Chestnuts, cauMower, 
onions, peas, beans, celery, spinach, etc., all make 
good purees for garnish of fish or meat dishes. 
The recipe given above will, with minor changes, 
serve for any pur6e. The method of sifting is 
the same in any case — i.e. with a wooden spoon 
rub the material through a strong wire sieve 
of medium mesh, first placing the sieve firmly

VEGETABLE CREAMS AND PUREES 249 

bottom npvhxds over a plate and scraping the 
materia from the tmder side as it passes through. 
In some cases, as always with meat and fish, the 
vegetable will pass through the sieve more readily 
if it be first mixed with the sauce, etc.

CHAPTER Vn 

HERBS AND SALADINGS 

Note. — ^This chapter includes those pot-herbs which 
are used in connection with salt food at the present 
^ day : a small list indeed compared with those of 
our fathers ; and the same may be said of their 
salftd-stuflfs, which were infinitely more varied and 
numerous than ours. John Evelyn reduced a long 
list of possible " salletings " to thirty-five ; but 
Abercrombie, writing about a century ago, men- 
tions forty-four. Wild flowers were included — 
whether as pure decoration or not it is hard to say 
— also very many young green shoots and sprouts, 
and no doubt a number of plants of exotic origin 
might now be added to the list. 

I have only included such herbs as are used for 
salt dishes. Bay-leaf is used for both sweet and salt. 
Salad vegetable)} already mentioned — ^beets, 
celery, cucumbers, endives, cresses, lettucee, 
radishes, tomatoes, etc., will be found in Chapter II 
under their respective headings. 

564. BOUQUET OF HERBS 

The faggot, or bouquet, so frequently used for 
flavouring, should consist of a bay-leaf, a sprig of 
thjrme or sweet marjoram, and two or three cloves 
wrapped and tied inside two or three small sprigs of 
parsley ; a piece of lemon-rind is sometimes added. 
Seeds, such as celery, peppercorns, etc., should be 
tied in a bit of muslin. 



260

HERBS AND SALADINGS 251 

Another method, more elaborate, is termed 
Ixmquet garni : for this you first put a layer pf parsley 
on the table ; then the bay-leaf and thyme, next, 
one or two spring onions, a strip of lemon-i>eel, and 
a very small blade of mace. Two cloves and a small 
stalk of celery may be added. The parsley is wrapped 
well round all these, and tied at both ends. Bay- 
leaf counts as a flavouring herb. The idea is, to be 
able to remove the herbs entire from the hot liquid 
which they have flavoured. 

565. ALEXANDERS 

This is a very ancient pot-herb, sometimes known 
as wild horse-parsley, and having a decided resem- 
blance to celery both in api>earance and flavour. 
It grows wild, and is a common plant in early spring, 
especially near the sea — in fact, its whole associa- 
tions are those of sea and spring, and the *' blowing 
of the western wind Favonius in Februarie '* (see 
Phny on alexanders). It can be used like celery, 
the upper part of the roots and the young tops 
(blanched or not) being eatable either as salad or 
cooked. 

566. ANISE 

Apart from medicinal usages, the seeds of this 
are chiefly employed for flavouring soups. It 
needs dis(»retion in the amount used, being fairly 
strong for our modem tastes, and having a highly 
individual flavour. 

567. BASIL 

Of this celebrated herb there are two varieties, 
sweet and bush basil. It is of great antiquity, and 
- has always been surrounded with the most extra- 
ordinary superstitions: €ts, that it must be sown 
with cursing and railing ; that it breeds scorpions ; 



Digitized by VnOOQ IC 



262 MAY BYRON'S VEGETABLE BOOK 

tMt it will not grow along with rue, etc., etc. Be 
all this as it may, basil is a most asefal flavouring 
herb for soups and salads, and no connoisseur in 
cookery can afford to be without it. By the French 
it is considered indispensable. It imparts a some- 
what clove-like taste, and can be used either fresh 
or dry. 

568. BURNET 

This is a salad-herb, which must be eaten young 
or not at all. It has a pleasant smell, and tastes 
rather like cucumber. It is a native plant, and was 
formerly to be found in every garden. 

569. CHERVIL 

This is a most valuable addition to salads, and 
(as a flavouring herb) to other salt dishes. It must 
not be confused with the vegetable chervil (see p. 
73). It is really a desideratum to the artistic and 
conscientious cook, because nothing can exactiy re- 
place it. 

570. CRESS 

This is the cheapest, commonest, and most popular 
of green-stuffs, except, perhaps, watercress. Its 
peculiarity is that one cannot think of cress without 
mustard : these two are practically inseparable. 
It, or they, can be stewed or boiled, but popular 
custom is aU in favour of eating them uncooked — 
and very excellent they are. Be sure, however, that 
your cress is fresh — stale '"salleting" is not only 
nasty, it collects bacilli with extreme assiduity. 

571. CHICORY, OR ENDIVE 

Endive is an admirable salad-herb when forced 
and blanched. So also is wild endive, or succory 



Digitized by VnOOQ IC 



HERBS AND SALADINGS 263 

{Barbe de Capudn), which boasts one of the loveliest 
blue flowers in England. A pleasant, and probably 
wholesome bitterness, characterises this plant, and it 
makes a very useful winter salading. (See p. 74.) 

672. DANDELION 

This can also be forced and blanched like chicory, 
but the very young dandelion supplies a delightful 
ingredient for salads. (See p. 81.) 

673. FENNEL 

An aromatic wild plant of which either the seeds 
or the chopped leaves are an excellent relish for fish 
dishes, especially mackerel and salmon. It has 
been cultivated for centuries, but I have never 
found the wild fennel much inferior, if at all, to 
the garden variety. It is usually either added to 
white sauce, like parsley, or, also like parsley, 
minced finely and strewn upon the fish in question. 



HORSE-RADISH 

Note. — One hardly knows under what heading 
to class this favourite condiment. Usually regarded 
as an indispensable companion to the roast beef of 
Old England, it certainly cannot be considered of 
dietetic value, though its mediaeval worth, especially 
as an anti-scorbutic, is unquestionable. It is 
probably more digestible grated than scraped ; and 
good horse-radish sauce, properly made, is a unique 
and delicious preparation. 

Preparation. — Choose a young and tender root in 
preference to an old one ; scrub it thoroughly, re- 
move all the ends, etc. Either scrape it into minute 
shavings, using a sharp knife, or grate it ; the latter 



Digitized by VnOOQ IC 



264 MAY BYRON'S VEGETABLE BOOK 

is preferable where sauce is concerned. If the 
process be carried on in a strong draught, your eyes 
will be less affected. 

674. HORSE-RADISH SAUCE, (X>LD 

To a small teacupful of grated horse-radish, add 
the same amount of cream, and mix well ; then stir 
in a small teaspoonful of salt, half a teaspoonful of 
pepper, a teaspoonful of powdered sugar; last of 
all, one tablespoonful of vinegar, which must be 
mixed in very gradually, so as not to curdle the 
cream. If you want the sauce still hotter, add a 
flat teaspoonful of mustard. 



676. HORSE-RADISH SAUCE, HOT 

Put a teacupful of grated horse-radish into a 
tumblerful of good stock, and simmer gently tiU 
heated throughout; then add two beaten yolks 
and one dessertspoonful of tarragon vinegar. Season 
with pepper and salt ; stir well till thick and hot, 
and serve. 

676. HYSSOP 

Not much used nowadays in England, but for- 
merly in request for flavouring broths and soups, 
and for sprinkling into salads. It is strongly 
aromatic, and has had a great reputation in its 
time. 

677. LAMB'S-LETTUCE OR CORN-SALAD 

A wild plant, frequently cultivated in gardens 
since Elizabethan days ; extremely popular in 
France as a salaid herb, but never a great favourite 
over here, though, indeed, it is, in G^erard's phrase, 
none of the worst.

HERBS AND SALADINGS 256 

678. MARIGOLD 

This cheerful, pleasant flower was once a sine 
qud non in broth and soup, " the Herb Generall in 
all pottage." The yellow petals, whether freshly 
gathered or dried, or pickled, are useful for flavour- 
ing broth or for adding to salads; they are not 
like anything else in taste or look, and are distinctly 
wholesome. 

579. MARJORAM 

A wild herb, grown largely as a garden pot-herb, 
and in former days as an adjunct to salads. Mar- 
joram is chiefly employed for flavouring soups and 
forcemeats, but its older uses might well be re- 
vived. It is peculiarly pretty when growing wild, 
— ^its soft purple-red blossoms being striking in their 
colour and profusion. 

580. MINT 

This invaluable herb is one of the best in all re- 
spects. Not only is it applicable (as a mere deli- 
cate soupfon) to salads, not only is it the sworn 
companion of green peas and new potatoes, but 
its very smell is refreshing and invigorating. The 
name mint is said to be derived from the Greek 
menthCy the mind, because of its cheering effect upon 
the spirits. 

Mint should be either absolutely dry — t.e. pow- 
dered — or absolutely fresh. Stale and flabby mint 
is worthless. Take plenty of mint leaves, wash 
them and gently squeeze out the moisture; chop 
them very small ; put them into a bowl or sauce- 
boat, and pour over them about two tablespoonfuls 
of boiling water ; add two tablespoonfuls of sugar. 
Cover up closely and leave in a cool place for about 
half an hour ; then add a pinch of salt, a dash of 
pepper, and either four tablespoonfuls of vinegar 



Digitized by VnOOQ IC 



266 MAY BYRON'S VEGETABLE BOOK 

or the juice of a lemon. If you intend to use the 
latter, one tablespoonful of sugar will sufSce. 

Mint-sauoe, as only too commonly made, is a 
repellent vinegarish liquid^ containing nothing but 
a few coarsely chopped pieces of mint. It is as 
different as chalk from cheese compared with the 
properly-made article, which should be thick with 
finely minced mint. 

681. MUSTARD 

The mustard which is inseparable from cress is 
not the same plant as that from which the condi- 
ment is made. It is a small salad herb which we 
have cultivated for many centuries, and even if 
one does not agree with the enthusiastic Evelyn 
that it is " of incomparable effect to quicken and 
revive the spirits," still, it is always welcome, as 
an addition to the salad-bowl or eaten plain with 
bread and butter — of course, plus cress. In prepar- 
ing mustard and cress for the table, be careful to 
remove, so far as possible, the split seeds which in 
many cases still adhere to the stalks. 

682. PARSLEY 

Perhaps the most celebrated, in point of anti- 
quity, among all pot-herbs — ^the source of innum- 
erable curious sayings and superstitions — ^parsley, 
from time immemorial has been in continual usage 
and appreciation. The roots, the leaves, and the 
seeds were cooked in olden days, or the fresh green 
sprays were valued as garnishing, or the chopped 
leaves were put into hot dishes as well as salads, 
or the seeds were strewn into various concoctions, 
from soup to cheese. Parsley was alternately re- 
garded as an evil omen of death and disaster which 
could throw a whole army into panic, or as the 
verdant mysterious garden-bed whence babies were

brought into the household. According to popular 
traditions, parsley must be sown only on Good 
Friday, if you want it to grow at all ; it has 
been said to go to the devil and back nine times 
before it comes up. As for its present culinary 
worth, I need hardly discuss that; but let me 
entreat you to use it as fresh as possible, to chop 
it (if to be chopped) as fine as possible, and to re- 
member that a Uttle garnishing of it lends attrac- 
tiveness to the plainest dish — ^it is so very clean 
and green and pretty. 

583. PURSLANE 
A thick, fleshy plant, which can be eaten either 
uncooked with salad dressing, or as a cold, cooked 
vegetable for salad purposes. It was formerly also 
pickled, like samphire. It is, I believe, coming into 
use again with many households. 

584. SAGE 
Many are the virtues attributed to sage by folks 
of bygone days; its very botanical name, Salvia, 
is derived from the idea of saving and healing. "" He 
that would live for aye," says the adage, " must cat 
sage in May." Its high repute extends so far back 
into the ages, that its present comparative discon- 
tinuance is the more strange. Sage and onions still 
hold their own, chopped sage is included in certain 
stuffings ; but we are not prone to include " the 
tender sunmiits of the young leaves," or the flowers 
of sage, in our salads, as in former centuries. 

585. SAMPHIRE 
An excellent wild plant, succulent, fleshy, aro- 
matic, known only to dwellers by the sea. Sam- 
phire (a corruption of Herbe de Saint Pierre) grows 
on rocky cliffs, and is not always easy to come at.

"Half-way down," wrote Shakespeare of Dover 
cliff, "' hangs one that gathers samphire — dangerous 
trade." The one that gathered samphire, wanted 
it for pickling and for salads — ^to both which pur- 
poses it is pre-eminently fitted. By popular repute 
it grows just out of reach of the waves, but just 
within reach of the spray, which endows it with a 
unique salty flavour, in addition to its natural 
spicy aroma. For centuries it was considered " the 
pleasantest sauce," and is still largely employed for 
pickling by those acquainted with its virtues. 

586. SAVORY 

There are two species of savory, (" summer " and 
" winter "), commonly used as pot-herbs ; both are 
very useful. They are not unlike marjoram in 
appearance and flavour, and are sometimes con- 
fused with it. Common savory, in other lands, is 
used much as we use parsley, finely minced and 
strewn over other v^etables, or put into pottage, 
etc. Winter savory, formerly used in dried and 
powdered form as a relish, although more in de- 
mand than the former kind, might be much more 
largely used with advantage. It is a grateful and 
pleasant herb. 

587. SORREL 

Practically indispensable on the Continent, but 
much neglected here of recent years. Sorrel is a 
salad-herb of exceeding individuality. It gives a 
touch of sour which is peculiarly fascinating; it 
imparts " so grateful a quickness to the salad that 
it should never be left out." Both garden sorrel 
and French sorrel are employed ; it is a matter of 
taste which you prefer. Do not put too much in 
the salad, that's all — ^a little goes a long way.

688. TARRAGON 

This aromatic and peculiarly individual herb is 
very precious to the expert cook, both for use like 
parsley, chopped and strewn, or as tarragon vine- 
gar. Its " somewhat austere " taste, as described 
by the old herbalist, renders it a most desirable 
addition to salads, as to certain sauces and dress- 
ings. I should class tarragon as an indispensable. 
It is especially useful, in vinegar form, for mixing 
"French" mustard. 

689. THYME 

This fragrant and aneient herb is full of gentle 
poetic associations, such as hardly any other culinary 
plant possesses. *' Evergreen, sweet-scented, fine- 
flavoured," thyme abounds in honey, and has just 
sufficient aromatic pungency to lend character to 
its delightful sweetness. There are many species, 
but for kitchen purposes lemon-thyme and common 
garden thyme are the best. Whether fresh or in 
a dried powdered state, it is invaluable. A little 
taste of thyme, especially lemon-thyme, is good in 
salads. 



SMALL ONIONISH SALADINGS 

690 CHIVES 

Chives are always spoken of in the plural; I 
do not think anybody ever said "a chive." This 
is because they are so very minute, more like 
tubular grass than anything else. They are Alliums, 
or onions, of the LiliaceaB order, and you might 
easily mistake their little leaves for those of some 
small liliaceous plant. It is the leaves only which 
are used, and these for flavouring purposes alone, 
finely chopped. They are excellent for salads.

591. QARLIO 

This is the strongest, rankest, and most pungent 
of all the onion tribe; it is specially popular, for 
some inscrutable reason, in hot countries, but in 
our temperate climate it should only be used with 
great discretion. Merely to rub a dish or salad- 
bowl with a clove of garlic is usually sufScient for 
culinary purposes. *' The little more, and how 
much it is ! " Throughout this book I have but 
seldom mentioned garlic, because, if overdone, it is 
too terrible to any cultivated taste. Still, it is a 
valuable thing, and has been r^arded as such from 
time immemorial. 

592. ROCAMBOLE 

A native of Denmark, and a member of the 
onion or Allium family, '^ the gentler Rocambole " 
has fallen more or less into disuse. It is not so 
strong as garlic, and not so mild as onion. The 
bulbs, used young and green, are delicate and 
savoury, and can be satisfactorily employed in 
all places where garlic is indicated. Few persons 
in this kingdom enjoy the rank pungency of the 
latter. 

693. SHALLOTS 

These may be described as the smallest and 
daintiest bulbs of the onion family. They are 
used for flavouring and pickling, but never, so far 
as I know, as an individual dish. They are most 
useful little bulbs where a very mild onionish sug- 
gestion is desired. The name is sometimes spelt 
'' eschalot," a corruption of the botanical surname 
asccUontcumy indicating its origin from Ascalon in 
Palestine. We are not to suppose that the Lady 
of Shalott was associated with anything so prosaic 
as even this meekest of onions.

694. SFRma ONIONS 

These are of guileless aspect, but immense potency. 
71iey hoard up the very essence of onion, compact 
and concentrated ; they are onion, as it were, in 
tabloid form. They are alluring in the extreme; 
you can't find their equal for salads. But after- 
wards you are " sorry you spoke." I have known a 
hapless person who spent a whole midsummer night, 
vainly endeavouring to banish the taste of spring 
onions, partaken of, in a supper salad, not wisely 
but too well. If you can make up your mind to 
like the taste of the spring onion when continued for 
eight or ten hours on end, there is nothing more 
appetising at the moment of eating. But oh, as the 
Canadians say, " 'tis fierce I "

CHAPTER Vin 

SALADS 

NoTB. — ^The word salad means, literally, something 
salted. It has come to be applied especially to a 
combination of vegetables, herbs, nuts, etc., either 
cooked or uncooked, but generally the latter, served 
cold, and with a sauce or dressing containing cream 
or oil, acid, and salt. You can have a salad of 
one v^etable only — a simple mixture of few in- 
gredients is preferable for many reasons; but 
salad, in its widest term, may comprehend a great 
many odds and ends besides its vegetable basis, its 
contents extending to eggs, cheese, fish, and even 
meat and game, not to mention various fruits. 
It may here be noted that the term " fruit salad '* 
is literally a contradiction in terms, since this latter 
dish is sweet, not salt. It is a melange of different 
fruits, carefully arranged ; but not, strictly speak- 
ing, a salad at all. 

Salads are of immemorial antiquity; here in 
England they have been popular, at any rate, since 
Shakespeare's days, and their main constituents, 
in all probability, have remained very much the 
same. I presume that the original salad consisted 
of uncooked vegetables fitnd herbs, and that the 
addition of cooked items is a comparatively modem 
innovation. The oldest salad-plant, in all proba- 
bility, is lettuce ; the next oldest, radish. After 
those, the favourites are cress, beet, celery, cucum- 
bers, cabbage (shredded), dandelion, encUve, mus- 

202

SALADS 263 

tard, onion, sorrel, tomato, and watercress. And 
when you have named these, you are only at the 
beginning, for in addition to all the salad-plants 
mentioned in Chapter VII. — ^which are or have been 
in common use in other countries, but have mostly 
been forgotten here— almost every cooked vegetable 
— ^potatoes first and foremost — can be successfully 
incorporated into a salad ; all manner of herbs can 
be employed for its seasoning. Almonds, hazel- 
nuts, pea-nuts, walnuts, etc., are an excellent 
addition ; hard-boiled eggs are invaluable ; cream 
cheese, English and foreign — Stilton, Cheddar, 
Gruydre, Neufchatel, may be requisitioned; so 
may apples, bananas, melons, oranges, pineapples, 
currants, cherries, etc., etc. Shredded scraps of 
fish, flesh, and fowl — ^tinned fish and potted viands 
— can all be included, on occasion, in this delectable 
compound which you mix and call a salad. 

^' But it needs heaven-sent moments for this 
skill." A salad ill-mixed, or carelessly arranged, 
or prepared with stale and flabby materials, is much 
worse than none at all. It ought to be (a) pleasant 
to the eye — ^prettily and decoratively placed, not 
dumped into a bowl all anyhow. It ought to be 
(b) nicely r^ulated in flavour and texture — ^pleasant 
to the mouth. And it ought to be (c) of distinct 
food-value— and so planned that it is so. 

For instance, lettuce and watercress, by them- 
selves, are very wholesome, but not very nourish- 
ing. Directly, however, you add a definite article 
of food — such as potato, or cheese, or egg, or nuts, 
even in very small quantities — ^you have distinctly 
heightened the dietetic value of the salad, and that 
is an important thing to do. 

Also it must be remembered that the oil or cream 
contained in the salad-dressing is a notable essen- 
tial to health, and although for people of weak 
digestion the vinegar which must companion the

oil is inadvisable, it may always advantageonsly 
be replaced by lemon-juice. A large number of 
salad dressings will be found in Chapter IX. 
but, as stated there, the secret of success in salad- 
dressing is slow and gradual amalgamation of all 
the ingredients, especially the acid — ^vinegar or 
lemon-juice — which always must be added iMt. 

PREPARATION OF A SALAD 

The green vegetable ingredients of a salad should 
be as fresh as possible: crisp tenderness is their 
first requisite. They should be gathered either in 
the early morning or after sunset, and kept in a 
cool place — not soaking in water, as is too fre- 
quently the case, but in a tin or earthenware vessel 
closely covered to exclude all air. 

Do not start cooking them till shortly before they 
are required, then cleanse them with great care. Cut 
oflE the root, remove discoloured leaves, and wash 
thoroughly, examining each leaf, for slugs and centi- 
pedes are unwelcome in a salad; then place them 
in very cold water, acidulated with a little lemon- 
juice and vinegar. Leave them about half an hour ; 
remove, drain, and dry — ^not by squeezing, but by 
swinging them to and fro in a piece of butter- 
muslin or a wire basket. You can, if need be, 
further gently wipe them between folds of butter- 
muslin or cheese-cloth, then let them stand open 
to the air for a minute. If they are wet, the dress- 
ing will not adhere to them properly. It is better 
to use a silver-plated knife than a steel one ; but a 
clean, sharp steel one may be employed for cos 
lettuce, the leaves of which should be piled one on 
another, and then cut through into ribbons of equal 
size. The outer leaves of cabbage lettuce may be 
treated similarly, but the inner leaves should not 
be cut at all^ merely separated each from each. 



Digitized by VnOOQ IC 



SALADS 266 

New potatoes, beets, and other fairly firm root 
vegetables should be cut into rings, rounds, cubes, 
or stars ; this can be done best with tin paste cutters. 
All the ingredients should be as neat and sym- 
metrical as possible — ^not ragged or haphazard in 
appearance — and as clean, cold, and crisp in texture 
%s you can get them. 

They should not be put together until the last 
moment before you are ready to dress them. 

It is possible to arrange a salad in decorative form, 
and to serve the dressing — especially if it be mayon- 
naise or bought " salad cream " — separately. This is 
usually considered rank treason and heresy against 
the orthodox rules of salad-making, but in some 
cases it is advisable, especially ioT people who 
strongly dislike oU, in obvious evidence. 

So far as is possible, I have avoided including 
any salads which contain meat, poultry, game, fish, 
or tinned stuff. These are all regarded as legitimate 
ingredients of a combination salad ; but they seem 
rather out of place in a Vegetable Book. 

The question of onions demands a paragraph to 
itself. Some people consider a salad tasteless with- 
out onion in some form — ^whether garlic, Spanish 
onion, shallots, chives, or those delicious but potent 
small spring onions, of which it may be said that 
they are " little — ^but, oh my ! " Other people, 
again, simply loathe to encounter any of these 
savoury vegetables. How are you going to please 
both ? Well, a few drops of onion juice (see No. 705) 
may be incorporated with the salad ; or a crust of 
br^d may be flavoured with garlic, onion, or shallot, 
and rubbed round the bowl inside (this is a very 
usual proceeding) ; or a slice of onion, or a clove of 
garlic, may be rubbed well round the bowl. The 
middle way, as usual, is the safest.

THE DECORATION AND ARRANGEMENT 
OF SALADS 

This is a most essential matter ; it makes all the 
difference between a mere rubbish-heap of un- 
considered trifles, and an ordered, organised, sym- 
metrical, and beautiful dish. Nature never makes 
anything carelessly or haphazard ; if you examine 
into the smallest daisy, you will find evidence of 
the most exquisite shaping, balance, and symmetry 
of its component parts. At the base of millions of 
flower-petals, where they are joined on to the corolla, 
you would discover the most intricate and lovely 
ornamentation of design and colour. No eye can 
see it, without unpicking the flower ; but there it is, 
all the same. A similar inconceivably perfect decora- 
tion exists in shells, in bird's feathers, in all sorts of 
microscopic objects ; the idea of rhythmic propor- 
tion, finish, and beauty pervades the whole. 

So that there is no waste of time or energy really 
involved, in humbly following the footsteps of 
Nature. If the Creator took all this meticulous care 
with the (apparently) most trivial of His works, we 
should not count it labour lost even to arrange a 
salad well. 

One may secure an almost infinite charm of variety 
in doing this. There are various points to consider : 
(1) the general form of the salad, (2) the way in 
which it is to be served, (3) and the manner in which 
it is to be garnished. The first should more or less 
dictate the second. A large combination salad 
including cooked and uncooked v^etables is more 
suitably placed in a big salad bowl, and there gar- 
nished to taste. A small and dainty salad of few 
ingredients can be served in nests of lettuce leaves, 
in baskets of halved orange-peel, in scooped-out shells 
of red apple, or cups fashioned from beetroot. 
Tomato '' cases " may be used ; small half-melon

SALADS 267 

rinds : in fact " there is nothing," as has been well 
said, *' which cannot be artistically blended with 
something else, in the fruit and vegetable world." 

Then as r^ards garnishes. Very often the main 
constituents of a salad, especially when it mostly 
consists of cold cooked vegetables, do not readily 
lend themselves to use as actual garnishes. It is 
true that you may cutyour beet, radishes, cucumbers, 
apples, bananas, and other firm ingredients into a 
variety of pretty fanciful forms ; you may combine 
them with all manner of additions in the way of 
nuts, cheese, hard-boiled egg, etc. For instance, 
you can arrange rings of Spanish onion with a centre 
of tomato in each ; hard-boiled ^gs may be cut in 
strips, with yolk centres, d la marguerite, or shaped 
into petals, like water-lilies ; or supplied, when the 
white is sliced in rings, with centres of beetroot or 
tomato. Little stars of cream cheese can be placed 
upon discs of beetroot. Tomato jelly or cucum- 
ber moulds may be used as bases for other items. 
Shredded white of egg and shredded beetroot can 
be arranged in a multiplicity of ways ; and all 
these colour-effects of whites, reds, and yellows can 
form kaleidoscopic combinations with the delicate, 
delicious greens of cress, and water-cress, nasturtium 
leaves and lettuce. There is really no limit to the 
methods in which you may exercise your artistry 
and ingenuity. 

Then, again, you may provide extra garnishee, 
all edible and appropriate to the particular salad 
in hand. Bunches of currants, white or red ; sprays 
of parsley ; many of the salad-herbs enumerated 
in Chapter VII ; ivory fragments of blanched endive ; 
golden suns of marigold. Endless, indeed, are the 
decorations open to the salad-maker.

the same ingredients, the shredded outside leaves 
of a cabbage lettuce and a beetroot cut into orna- 
mental shapes. Any trimmings left from the vege- 
tables should be chopped small together, and 
dressed as above. Place the lettuce in the middle

CHAPTER IX 

SAUCES, SALAD DRESSINGS, ETC. 

NoTB. — ^As the Sattce Book of this series will be 
devoted wholly to its subject, I include here only 
such sauces and dressings as are to be used with 
vegetable or vegetarian dishes. A sauce may be 
the making or the marring of a concoction, and 
yet it is the rarest thing in the world to find a really 
well-made sauce in the average English household. 
A French epigram declares that *' one may become 
a good cook or roaster — one must be bom a sauce- 
maker." It is not only a matter of skill and ex- 
perience—though these are infinitely necessary. It 
requires a fine taste, a sense of daintineas and 
deUcacy, and the mot juste in flavouring. Sauce 
demands, in short, that you should treat it " as if 
you loved it." The crude unappetising prepara- 
tions too often dignified by the names of sauces and 
salad-dressings are literally not worth their salt. 
Whereas '' a perfect sauce," it has been said, ^* ia 
a promoter of digestion and an aid to nutrition; 
where a contrary effect is produced, something ia 
wrong with the sauce." 

A sauce will render the commonest vegetable 
more palatable, by presenting it under a new aspeotp 
and with a different added fiavouring. Texture, 
also, so important a point in gastronomic matters, ia 
to be considered here ; it is because the sauce ia 
of so different a texture and consistency to the 

288 



Digitized by VnOOQ IC 



SAUCES, SALAD DRESSINGS, ETC. 289 

vegetable, that it is doubly welcome. I venture to 
thhik that very few household cooks recognise the 
extreme help and value of sauces. 

All simple sauces are, or should be, produced 
from rotix, white, yellow, or brown, mixed with salt 
and pepper, and diluted with liquid — cream, milk, 
water, or stock. 

Boux, which imparts substance to a sauce, is 
made with equal weights of flour and butter (or 
with twice the weight of butter to the flour) cooked 
together. Place the butter, say one ounce, in 
a small, smooth, clean pan ; when it has melted till 
it bubbles, add half an ounce of flour, with a quarter 
of a teaspoonful each of salt and white pepper. 
Stir this well in, and continue to stir until the mix- 
ture turns yellowish — ^three to five minutes. (If 
you want a brown sauce, go on stirring until the 
mixture turns a reddish brown.) Now move the 
pan to a cooler part of the range, gradually add a 
cupful of cold milk or white stock, stirring constantly. 
When all the liquid has been added, let the sauce 
boil up again fast, then let it simmer five minutes 
in a cooler place. If 3^u are not ready to use it, 
stand it in hot water, covered over so that it 
shall not form a film on top. If, after standing 
thus, you find the butter separated from the sauce, 
with an oily appearance, add one tablespoonful of 
cold liquid and stir over the fire imtil it boils again. 

This is the foundation of all thickened sauces. 

For mayonnaise and other salad dressings, re- 
member that a teaspoonful of lemon-juice or vine- 
gar, added to the yolks of eggs before the oil is put 
in, will lessen any liability to curdle. If, however, 
the mixture should curdle, break a yolk of egg into 
another bowl, add to this, very gradually, the 
curdled dressing, and then continue to add the oil, 
drop by drop; this will set things right. In making 
a large quantity of mayonnaise, the number of 

19

290 MAY BYRON'S VEGETABLE BOOK 

yolks may be cut down to half, but the same pro- 
portions of the other ingredients must be retained 
intact. 

BUTTERS AND SAUCES 

669. BUTTER, CLARIFIED 
Put eight ounces of good butter in a small 
enamelled saucepan, place this in another pan con- 
taining boiling water, let it stand on the comer 
of the range till quite melted (about twenty-five 
minutes), and when it looks clear, like salad oil, 
skim it and strain through a fine cloth into a heated 
sauce-boat. A little pepper and lemon-juice may 
be added at discretion. 

660. BUTTER, DEVILLED 
Mix well in a bowl the following : half an ounce 
of good butter ; two saltspoonfuls of dry mustard ; 
one teaspoonful each of white wine vinegar and 
Worcester sauce ; one saltspoonful of salt ; half a 
saltspoonful of cayenne pepper ; one yolk of ^gg. 

661. BUTTER, GREEN 
One sound peeled shallot, a quarter of a clove of 
peeled garlic, two branches of well-cleaned parsley, 
one branch of fresh watercress, three-quarters of an 
ounce of fresh butter, one saltspoonful and a half of 
salt, one-half saltspoonful of cayenne pepper. Place 
all these in a mortar, except the butter, and pound 
to a -pulp ; add now the butter, and pound again 
until the whole is well thickened. Pass through a 
strainer into a bowl, keep in a cool place, and use 
as required. 

662. BUTTER MATTRE D'HOTEL

SAUCES 

686. CHEAP SALAD DRESSING 
Mix one teaspoonful of made mustard, half that 
quantity of salt, and a dash of pepper, with one 
teaspoonful of powdered sugar, half a pint of un- 
sweetened condensed milk, pounded yolk of hard- 
boiled egg, and half a teacupful of vinegar — ^the 
milk to be added last. Stir thoroughly, and let it 
stand an hour before using. 

687. COOKED SALAD DRESSING, No. 1 
Mix a quarter of a teaspoonful of salt with the 

same of mustard, and a few grains of cayenne; 
add the yolks of two eggs and the white of one; 
beat until well mixed, then add four tablespoonfuls 
of butter and three-quarters of a cupful of sweet 
cream. Place over hot water and stir until the 
mixture thickens slightly ; then add, very gradually, 
two tablespoonfuls of vinegar, and set the sauce 
aside to become cold. 

688. COOKED SALAD DRESSING, No. 2 
Cream a quc^rter of a cupful of butter and a 

quarter of a cupful of sugar with one tablespoonful 
each of salt and mustard and a few grains of cayenne ; 
add three beaten eggs, and pour all into one cupful 
of cream (either sweet or sour). Stand the mixture 
over hot water, and stir ; when it b^ins to thick^i, 
add the vin^ar, a few drops at the time. Beat 
constantly, and occasionally remove from the hot 
water to avoid overheating or curdling. 

680. FRENCH SALAD DRESSING 
Mix half a teaspoonful of salt, quarter of a tea- 
spoonful of pepper (freshly ground if possible), witii

SAUCES, SALAD DRESSINGS, ETC- 299 

a few grains of cayenne, or else a quarter of a 
teaspoonfol of mustard, then add six tablespoon- 
fuls of oil, and, if desired, a few drops of onion- 
juice. Lastly, add either lemon-juice or vin^ar, 
drop by drop — ^from two to six tablespoonfuls, 
according to taste — and beat until the whole forms 
a thick emulsion; then pour this over the salad 
materials, and toss them with a spoon and fork 
until the whole of the materials are slightly coated 
and glossy with the dressing. 

Some people first mix the pepper, salt, and oil, 
and sprinkle this upon the materials, till they are 
all coated, then finish with the lemon-juice and 
vin^ar applied separately. In any case, a salad 
cannot be considered perfectly dressed unless every 
individual leaf or scrap of material is thinly coated 
with dressing, the most essential part of which 
should always be salad oil. 

690. SALAD DRESSING FOR LARGE FAMILY 

Break two eggs into a bowl, beat them up, and 
mix in gradually half a teaspoonful each of mustard, 
salt, and pepper, one tablespoonful of butter, and 
lastly three tablespoonfuls of vinegar. Stand the 
dish in boiling water and stir until the mixture is 
as thick as cream, then pour it over your salad. 

691. SALAD DRESSING FOR ONE QUART 

Have in a cold soup-plate a level teaspoonful of 
Indian curry-powder, half a teaspoonful of best 
French mustard, a light saltspoonful of ground 
mustard, a light saltspoonful of cayenne pepper, 
one teaspoonful of finely chopped, thoroughly 
washed and drained fresh paisley, half a tea- 
spoonful of finely chopped, sound, fresh chives, 
two medium, very soimd, freshly peeled and finely 
chopped shallots, one-fourth of a small dove of

Bound, peeled garlic finely crashed, four teaspoon- 
fuls of salt, and one l^ht teaspopnful of very 
fresh, finely ground white pepper, the rind of a 
quarter of a sound lemon^ &iely chopped. Mix 
f^ the ingredients well together with a fork, then 
add a tablespoonful of good olive oil, and with 
a fork sharply mash the whole until almost to a 
pulp; gradually add four tablespoonfuls of good 
white wine vin^ar ; briskly mix agedn, then transfer 
the whole into a vessel ; add oil and vinegar — ^two- 
thirds of oil to one-third of vinegar — ^to make up 
one quart in all ; thoroughly mix ag£dn, and then 
press through a strainer into a glass or stone jar 
and use as required, being very careful always to 
sharply shake the dressing before pouring it over 
the salad. Keep in a cold place, covered. Half, 
or a quarter of above quantity may be made. 

692. PLAIN SALAD DRESSING 
Take the yolks of two hard-boiled eggs ; pound 
them very carefully until they are in a fine powder, 
entirely free from lumps; then add gradually a 
tablespoonful (or a little more, according to taste) 
of the best salad oil, and stir it well until it is the 
consistence of a smooth paste ; then add a table- 
spoonful of freshly mixed mustard. After this is 
well mixed, stir in very gradually two tablespoonfuls 
of white vinegar and a teaspoonful of tarragon 
vinegar ; then add a little salt and pepper. Wh^ 
these are all well mixed, stir in gradually a large 
teacupful of good sweet cream or new inilk; add 
a teaspoonful of castor sugar. The whites of the 
^gs are to be incorporated in the salad in every 
case.

made as below, and jou add a mixture of finely 
chopped herbs and vegetableB in equal quantdtdes 
of each : viz., chervil, tarragon, chives, and capers, 
with the pounded yolk of a hard-boiled egg. As 
many people have no means of obtaining the above 
herbs, etc., I should suggest, as alternatives, parsley, 
shallots or small onions, pickled nasturtium seedEi, 
and thyme. 

694. SOUR CREAM SALAD DRESSING 

Take three hard-boiled yolks, and rub them smooth 
in four tablespoonfuls of thick sour cream, which 
must be added very gradually. Add one small tea- 
spoonful of castor sugar, the same of mustard, a 
dash of pepper, a little salt, and sufficient lemon- 
juice to thin the mixture to taste. Mix well. 

695. VINAIGRETTE (FRENCH SALAD DRESSING), 
No. 1 

One teaspoonful of mixed mustard, one teaspoon- 
ful of salt, half a teaspoonful of castor sugax, about 
quarter of a teaspoonful of black pepper, and 
(gradually added) one tablespoonful of vinegar, and 
two tablespoonfuls of salad oil. Stir and mix 
thoroughly. 

Oeam can always be substituted for salad-oil, 
and in all cases where vinegar is mentioned, 
lemon-juice can be advantageously used instead. 
It is not cheaper, but it is far wholesomer. 

CW. VINAIGRETTE, No. 2 

Two tablespoonfuls of salad oil, one tablespoonful

which is the secret of a successful salad dressing. 

6»7. SAUCE MAYONNAISE, No. 1 

Take one yolk, one eggspoonful of made mustard, 
half a saltspoonful each of salt and pepper ; mix 
well with a wooden spoon ; add over half a break-

half a breakfastcup of good olive oil, continually 
mixing, and still mixing for three or four minutes 
after the oil is all in ; add the juice of a quarter 
of a lemon, and mix again.

Two yoOoB of ^gs, half a pint of salad oil (or 
cream if preferred), a pinch of pepper, half a tea- 
qKXHifal of salt, one dessertspoonful of malt vinegar, 
one dessertspoonful of tarragon vinegar. The oil 
(NT cream should be added, drop by drop, to the 
yolks, and the vinegar added very (^tuiually at the 
end, taking great care that the sauce does not 
curdle. 

701. MAYONNAISE SAUCE, No. 5 

Two raw eggs broken into a bowl; add one 
tablespoonful of butter, half a teaq>oonful of 
mustard; three tablespoonfuls of vinegar added 
last. Stand the bowl in fast-boiling water, and 
stir until the sauce is as thick as cream ; then add 
half a teaspoonful each of salt and pepper, and 
pour the mixture over sliced cold potatoes, sliced 
tomatoes, or whatever you wish to dress. 

702. SAUCE MAYONNAISE, COOKED 

Add to six whisked yolks two teaspoonfuls of 
made mustard, one saltspoonful of salt, and a pinch 
of cayenne, stirring continuously. Place in an 
enamelled saucepan, then add a quarter of a pint of 
salad oil, whisking all the time ; next, a quarter of 
a pint of cream, and one tablespoonful each of 
vinegar and Worcester sauce ; add all these very 
gradually, and lastly add a quarter of a pint of 
vinegar in the same way. Continue to stir gently 
all the time you are mixing, or the sauce will curdle. 
Place the pan over hot water or a slow fire, whisk 
till the mixture thickens (but it must not boil).

keep for eight or ten weeks if put into wide^mouthed 
bottles and closely corked. 



VARIOUS 
703. BLANC 

This is a stock used for cooking white vege- 
tables in; it not only flavours them, but pre- 
serves their colour. One pound of finely minced 
beef suet is placed in a stewpan, with one table- 
spoonful of flour and three and a half pints of cold 
water. When this boils, add half a pound of finely 
chopped onion, one lemon-rind, one tablespoonful 
of powdered thyme, a few sprigs of parsley, one 
teaspoonful each of sugar and of salt. Let boil for 
thirty minutes over a sharp fire, then strain and 
use. A slice or so of lemon helps to retain the 
colour of white vegetables cooked in blanc. 

704. DEMI-GLACE 

Note. — ^Demi-glace, or half-glaze, is very important 
to the more elaborate cooking of vegetables. It must 
be made in a large quantity at a time, as the recipe 
will show, and in summer must be boiled up again 
every week. In winter it will keep for three or four 
weeks in good condition. When the supply is nearly 
exhausted, more must be made. It should be 
diluted with a little hot broth before using ; this 
only refers to what is actually taken out of tiie jar. 

Put ten quarts of cold water into a laxge saucepan ; 
place it on the stove. Take two fresh calves' feet, 
cut them small, and put them into a small baking- 
pan, with half a pound of raw ham, cut up ; one 
pound of veal bones, two sliced carrots, two sliced 
onions, two sliced leeks, three large sprigs of parsley, 
one head of celery (sliced) ; add ten cloves, four

SAUCES, SALAD DRESSINGS, ETC. 306 

bay leaves, twenty allspioee, two tablespoonfuls of 
black peppercorns, one teaspoonful of minced 
thyme, one and a half tablespoonfuls of salt. Put 
about four tablespoonfuls of fat — ^butter, lard or 
dripping— over the vegetables, and place in a hot 
oven till they have all turned a nice golden brown. 
Remove the contents of the pan and put them into 
the pan of water, along with one pint of tomatoes 
(fresh or tinned). Boil slowly for half an hour ; then 
move pan to side of range and let it simmer very 
gently. Any little odds and ends of meat or veget- 
ables can go into the pan. Let it stay where it is 
until the demi-glace is reduced to half the original 
quantity. 

705. ONION JUICE 

This is most valuable as a flavouring, and saves 
time in cooking. Peel an onion, cut a thin slice off 
one end, then rub it with a rotary motion against 
a grater, and the juice will begin to run. Rub the 
grater against the onion till all the juice is extracted. 
Another method is to keep a lemon-squeezer speci- 
ally reserved for onions.

VARIOUS DISHES OF VEGETABLES 
COMBINED WITH EGGS, ETC. 

Note. — ^To blend ^gs in some tasty form with 
vegetables, more than doubles the food-value of a 
dish. Needless to say, the eggs should be above 
suspicion ; and the dish should be served very hot, 
attractively arranged, not an unappetising hotch- 
potch. 

706. EOOS AND BEETROOT 

Take a sound cooked beetroot ; cut eight rounds, 
two inches in diameter and very thin (about as thick 
as a new penny). Mince a small shallot or a piece 
of onion, a few capers, and a gherkin ; mix with a 
tablespoonful of salad oil and, about a teaspoonful 
of vinegar. Arrange the beet upon some cress in a 
salad bowl, put the above mixture smoothly on each 
round, and on top of each lay a slice of hard-boiled

them, and fry in deep bofling lard which will corer 
them completely. Serve witii green peas, on small 
croiktons. 

708. EGO CURRY 

Boil twelve fresh eggs for dght minutes, lift up 
and let slightly cool off. Loosen shells by gently 
and carefully rolling on a table with the hand with- 
out detaching shells, place on a deep dish, cover with 
salt, let st€md for ten hours, shell, cut into quarters 
lengthwise, and keep on a plate till required. Melt 
a tablespoonful of butter in a saucepan, add one and 
a half tablespoonfuls of flour and stir a little. Add 
a small sliced onion, half a clove of crushed garlic, a 
smaU finely chopped apple, half a chopped chili, a 
saltspoonful each of dried bay leaf and thyme, half 
a teaspoonful of chopped tarragon, and gently brown 
for ten minutes, frequently stirring meanwhile. 
Moisten with a pint of hot water, season with a tea- 
spoonful of salt, two saltspoonfuls of cayenne, a 
saltspoonful of grated nutmeg and a teaspoonful of 
curry powder. Add a piece of lemon rind and one 
chopped red tomato, mix all well together, let cook 
for thirty minutes, remove lemon rind and heat eggs 
at oven door for two minutes. Arrange a curry 
rice on a hot dish in crown-like form, place eggs in 
centre, pour contents of pan over eggs, and serve. 

709. EGGS IN DRESSING-GOWNS 

Choose some round, even-sized potatoes, parboil 
and then bake them in the oven ; when cooked, 
slice off the top, scoop out some of the potato, put 
a little piece of dripping in each, season with pepper 
and salt, and break a fresh egg into each ; return 
them to the oven till the eggs are cooked, then 
cover over the eggs lightly with the potato which 
was removed, which should in the meantime have

been mashed to a light snow, with a little dripping,

This is a digital copy of a book that was preserved for generations on Hbrary shelves before it was carefully scanned by Google as part of a project 

to make the world's books discoverable online. 

It has survived long enough for the copyright to expire and the book to enter the public domain. A public domain book is one that was never subject 

to copyright or whose legal copyright term has expired. Whether a book is in the public domain may vary country to country. Public domain books 

are our gateways to the past, representing a wealth of history, culture and knowledge that's often difficult to discover. 

Marks, notations and other maiginalia present in the original volume will appear in this file - a reminder of this book's long journey from the 

publisher to a library and finally to you.

public and we are merely their custodians. Nevertheless, this work is expensive, so in order to keep providing this resource, we liave taken steps to 
prevent abuse by commercial parties, including placing technical restrictions on automated querying.

because we believe a book is in the public domain for users in the United States, that the work is also in the public domain for users in other 
countries. Whether a book is still in copyright varies from country to country, and we can't offer guidance on whether any specific use of 
any specific book is allowed. Please do not assume that a book's appearance in Google Book Search means it can be used in any manner

NOTES AND HINTS 

Thb word VegeialAt is a wide one, loosely ueed. 
It may simply mean something that growa out of 
the earth, as distinguished from something animal 
that walks about on the earth, or something mineral, 
which (to all appearances, but these are deceptive) 
doesn't either move or grow. If you look in a 
dictionary, that (as usual) confuses the matter still 
more, for it says that vegtiabU is from the Latin 
vegetaa, or lively (I), and vegere, to move or 
quicken (tt), and vegeiabilia, animating (III). There 
couldn't be anything farther removed from one's 
ordinary notions of a vegetable, ^wever, oa 
mature consideration, one Is brought back to the 
idea that a vegetable has grown, moved, developed 
out of the earth, just as I said at first. I refuse 
to call it lively, but we must allow that it has 
" growed." And as to " animating " — well, Huxley 
said that every plant was a spirit confined in a 
wooden case. Pythagoras forbade his disciples to 
eat beans, because of hia peculiar doctrines about 
the transmigration of souls. . . . We are wandering 
away from Uie point, and getting into deep waters. 
Let me restrict myself by stating that this book 
deals with 

EDIBLE AND CUUNABY VEGETABLES 

They may be leaves, like cabbage ; or roots, like 

carrots ; oi Bhoote, like asparagus ; or bulbs, like

onions ; or etalks, like celery. They may be tobor 
like potatoes ; or fruits, like tooiatoes ; or thistli 
heads, like globe artichokes ; or seeds, like peu 
or flovers, like broccoli. The oentral fact abot 
them all is that they can be eaten, and they (mostl] 
mast be cooked. 

The Qse of v^etables as eatables is a singula 
intermittent affair. Roughly speaking, it is oonfiae 
as a rule to the hotter countries, and the peon 
peoples. It is a result of poverty, of climate, <Hr e 
ultra^ivilisation ; for man in an aboriginal oonditioi 
eats flesh meat if he can get it. Roots and Emit 
and leaves are not his primary idea of food. Hi 
" green herb of the field " ceased to be his onttot 
sustenance at a given prehistoric period. StiD 
there are wild tribes who cultivate grains an 
vegetables of sorts — because flesh meat is so eoara 
for them. 

The oldest vegetables, from a gardening point a 
view, are, so far as I can ascertain, (I) the Cvcm 
bitacecE — gourde, melons, cucumbers, etc. (which, a 
course, are, properly speaking, fruits) — known * 
the Semitic races, the ancient Egyptians, and tb 
American aborigines ; (2) the Legutninoaee — pni 
beans, lentils — which were known to the Brou 
Age people, and immensely popular with the Semiti 
and Egyptian races, not to mention the earliw 
Greeks and Romans ; (3) the Allium or Onion trflu 
(belonging to the LiliacecB), of practically simjlw 
antiquity ; (4) the Braaaicts or Cabbage fanu^ 
(6) root vegetables, such as parsnips, carroli 
beets, etc. ; (6) asparagus ; (7) ekirrets ; (8) po 
tatoes and Jerusalem artichokes. The aboTe, a 
course, is only a rough r^sum^, and further pti 
ticulars will be found in the Notes attached to ead 
vegetable throughout this book. 

In Europe, with the fall of the Roman empifB 
vegetables seem to bare declined in popular faTour;

and, apparently, they did not regain their old 
footing until after the Renaissance. The spread 
of classio literature was alBO the spread of claBsio 
vegetables. Exhumed out of long neglect, from 
the fourteenth century onward, one finds regetablea 
being more and more cultivated, and slowly, very 
slowly introduced from one country to another. 
We, after our usual habit, were the last of all 
to profit by these developments, although a large 
number of the Tegetables in question already grew 
freely as wildings in this fruitful isle. 

Our ancestors of the Middle Ages — such as were 
well'tonlo — did not, indeed, take much notice of 
Tegetables, except as salads. The robust and 
sturdy Elizabethans added copious ** salletinga " to 
their bill of fare, but even the potato was at first 
regarded as a mere medium for conveying the 
Elizabethans' beloved and all-important sugariness. 
They expended their ingenuity and their appetite 
upon fish, flesh, and fowl, elaborately spiced and 
seasoned ; all very well for those to eat vegetables 
who could get nothing better. Gerarde experi- 
mented, in his Holborn garden, with the " love- 
apple," or tomato ; Parkmson interested himself in 
new and rare productions like the cauliflower. But 
those who could afford it, preferred meat ; and 
ginger was " hot i' the mouth, too," with most meat 
dishes. 

Ueanwhile the poor folk made shift to eke oat 
their scanty meals with any sort of greenstuff. 
I have myself spoken with a man who, in his child- 
hood, before the repeal of the Corn Iaws, had sub- 
sisted largely on charlock, young nettles, and other 
■uch free gifts of field and hedgerow. 

During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, 
culinary vegetables became a continually more fre- 
quent addition to the dinner-table ; during the nine- 
teenth century they reached, perhaps, their ma-riTrn tn i

of variety, for a great many whioh were cultivated 
for a decade or so after the " hungry Forties " have 
dropped out of use, and have not been replaced ttf 
new ones. The list available in the greengrooer'i 
shop, like the number of individual vegetable! 
grown in the average garden, is quite extraordinary 
in its limitations. On the Continent, and in the 
United States, a much wider range is proff««d. 

But whereas in former days a vegetable was 
strictly seasonal, so that you could not obtain, let 
us say, a new potato born out of due time, nowadays 
the seasons are very nearly negUgible, by reason of 
(a) foreign products and (b) improved methods of 
storage. I don't maintain for a moment that the 
expensive forced vegetable is half so good aa that 
wluch arrives naturally at its authentic date. Tia 
former seems to have missed juat that much of mm 
and rain and sweet influences which went to 
make up the latter. And the stored vegetable 
cannot, in reason, be equal to the fresh one £ m 
may here except potatoes. 

The fact remains, however, that owing to all 
these increased facilities, strict vegetarianism has 
become, not only a fad or a fashion, but a cult and 
an obsession with very many people. Some pei> 
sons it suits ; some it doesn't. You cannot tell 
till you have tried. In any case it is no use dog- 
matising : chacun & son gout. 

Although this book is not written for the professed 
and rigid vegetarian (for some such might cavil at 
the meat stock and animal butter employed in 
many of the recipes), yet the professed vegetarian 
will find it of considerable value in the number 
and interest of dishes here presented ; whilst the 
ordinary housewife, desirous of combining variety 
with economy, and pleasing her family into the 
beirgain, will here find suggestion of the wideet 
scope — of which the gardener may also t^e

advantage, in supplying her witli something more 
liberal in his seasonal range of foodstuffs. The 
present enhanced price of meat makes the wise 
choice of satisfying vegetables a matter of extreme 
importance. 

The following rough list will give some notion 
of the respective value of vegetables from a nutritious 
point of view — t.e. regarding them as quality rather 
than as quantity. 

1. Potatoes. 

2. Jerusalem Artichokes, 

3. Parsnips. 

i. Peas, Beans, Lentils. 

5. Beets and Carrots. 

6. Onions and Leeks. 

7. Celery, Seakale, Salsify, 

8. Cauliflower and Broccoli. 

9. Green Vegetables in general. 
10. Everything else. 

A FEW DONTS 

(1) Don't boil any vegetable if you can steam it. 

{2) Don't use any more water than you can possi- 
bly help, if you must boil the vegetable : let it 
cook in its own juices so far as poseible. 

(3) Don't throw away the water thus used c it 
oontAins much of the essential salts of the vegetable. 
Use it for stock or sauce, that same day if you can. 

(4) Don't put any vegetable into cold water to 
cook it, except potatoes (old) and Jerusalem arti- 
chokes. Put it into fast-boiling water. 

(6) Don't forget to salt the water c it makes all 
the difference to the flavour of the vegetables. 

(6) Don't use washing soda on any account : use 
(if absolutely necessary on account of the hardness 
of the . water) a minute pinch of bicarbonate of 
soda — about what would cover a thieepenny-bit.

6 MAT BTBON'S VEGETABLE BOOK 

(7) Don't throw away peelings, pariiigB,tiiininiiigi 
or any vegetable matter. Wrap them up tigbtfy in 
sn old newspaper, let them become fairly dry, and 
use them as fuel. 

{8) Don't dump the vegetable into the dish all 
wet. Strain and drain out the moisture as com- 
pletely and as quickly as you can, but so aa not 
either to spoil the shape and appearance of the 
vegetable, or to let it got cold. 

(9) Don't put it into a cold dish nnless it ib to 
be served cold. A hot thing put into a cold dish is 
one of the most unpardonable crimes in cookery i 
and it is "worse than a crime — it is a blonder," 
likely to undo all your trouble and spoil the whc^ 
thing. 

(10) Don't despise any left-over vegetables, how- 
ever small. They can all be used up for saladi, 
stews, or soups : only don't leave them to become 
stale or sour, especially such as have been aervod 
in sauce. 

ADVICE IN GENERAL 

Vegetables should be gathered early in the mcnt- 
ing, and kept in a cool dark place ; to put them in 
a clean dry pail, covered with paper, is a very good 
plan. 

If you are not lucky enough to grow your own 
vegetables, buy them as fresh as you can ; umI 
never keep any till the next day before using. You 
don't know how long they may have been knocking 
about in market^carts and markets, collecting gennt 
and getting flabbier every minute. 

Green vegetables which are flabby and discoloured 
are not worth cooking, neither are root vegetablci 
which are limp and stale. The flrst should be crisp 
and green, the second firm and stiff. 

To draw out and kill slugs, caterpillars, etc., in

cabbage and cauliflower, add a little vinegar^to the 
water you Boak them in while prepanng them. 

Root vegetables should be cooked in a covered 
pan ; but all green leaf vegetables, except spinach, 
are best cook^l with the lid off. Green vegetables 
must be boiled very fast, and never allowei to go 
off the boil. 

Any unpleasant smell proceeding from vegetables 
during their boihng can be obviated by changing 
the water during the cooking, but by so doing you 
will waste a good deal of the mineral salte. A better 
plan is to put a piece of toasted crost in a little 
muslin bag, along with the vegetable. 

Be sure to drain all vegetables thoroughly after 
cooking, as quickly as possible. 

Nothing is more unappetising than cold or luke- 
warm ve^etabl^ ; take care, therefore, to serve, 
them hot in a, hot dish with a hot cover. Quite 
commonly a careleee cook will plank down her 
v^etablee into a chilly or tepid dish. 

There is no v^etable whatever (and this especi- 
ally applies to roots and tubers) but what is greatly 
improved by the addition of a good sauce, served 
separately ot otherwise.

rather more. 

THE VALUE OF STEAMING 
It has been well said that " a vegetable is not 
merely so much bulk to stuff into the human frame. 
It contains varying proportions of certain consti- 
tuents necessary for the support of healthy life — ■ 
nitrogenous, mineral, sugary, starchy matter, etc., 
etc. You want to preserve as much of these as 
possible, and not to waste any." Steamed vege- 
tables only incur one-third of the loss which is in- 
curred by boiling. But boiled vegetables lose 
enormously ; from one-third of the total food 
material (in the case of cabbages) to an incredible 
wastage in the case of peeled and boiled potatoes. 
All the value which goes into the water in boiling, 
moreover, is actually lost, unless it is reserved for 
v^etable stock. If, therefore, you must boil a 
v^etable, nee as little water as possible. 

In the ease of spinach and other leaves of similar 
calibre, no water at all is necessary : they con be 
cooked in their own moisture.

Bat Bteaming not only Baves U^valnable mineral 
salts and food materia], it retains the indiridaal 
flavonr of a vegetable, and ite shape and form, in 
a Tray which boiling can never do. 

By using a large steamer with at least two com- 
partments, you will save space, gas, and coal, and 
' the principal values of your vegetables. If yon 
haven't a steamer, make one by a " contraption '* : 
a colander over a pern of boiling water will do, «o bmg 
€ta it is covered closely. This is most important. 
Kone of the steam must be suffered to escape. Yon 
must be careful, however, to replenish the water aa 
it boils away, and to keep it continually boiling. 
Steamed vegetables will take nearly twice as Itxig 
to cook as boiled ones ; but they will be worth nearly 
three times as much, r^arded as food. Very much 
more in the case of potatoes. 

The recipes in this book chiefly indicate boiling : 
they also often indicate a lot of water, because 
they are collected from a vast variety of sources, 
and the original belief in boiling dies hard. But ooi 
thrifty continental neighbours would hardly credit 
the wastage that has gone on over here, all these 
centuries, in the matter of vegetable " stock," and 
I hope that hard times may have the effect of teach- 
ing us wisdom and economy in this respect.

CHAPTER U 

VEGETABLES, COOKED PLAINLY 
OR ELABORATELY 

ARTICHOKES (GLOBE) 
NoTi. — ^The Globe Artichoke — bo little grown now- 
adays, regarded as a rarity and a luxury — can boast 
itself of immeaeurable antiquity. Its name is 
derived from the Arabic Alkharahuf. It is not only 
one of the oldest cultivated vegetables in the world, 
it is tA« artichoke, and all others are merely so-called 
because of their fancied resemblance in flavour to 
this one. The Greeks and Romans were enjoying 
the globe artichoke while the humble Jerusalem 
artichoke was still undreamed of. It is a kind of 
huge thistle, of which you can only eat the eoaly 
immature flower-heads ; and of these, the only 
essential part is the fleshy base to which the unde- 
veloped petals are attached. &b>reover, it is not 
to be found in many gardens ; people don't consider 
the game worth the candle, for though the artichoke 
is nominally a hardy perennial, in various distriotB 
it is nothing of the sort. And it must be gathered 
and cooked at exactly the right moment, when 
neither too small to be flavourless or too large to be 
succulent. , , . The " chards " which succeed the 
flower heads also make good eating. 

Preparation. — Cut the stem level with the learee, 
remove some of the tough bottom leaves ; the top 
leaves may also be trimmed into shape by cutting

away about an inch. Subsequently wash the 
artichokes, and proceed to cook them. Serve with 
bewre fondu in a separate dish. 

1. ABTICHOKES BOIL£D 
Prepare as stated above. Place the artichokes 
in boiling salted water. Let them continue to boil 
fast until the leaves will come away easily from the 
base — say about thirty minutes. Serve with melted 
butter or Sauce Hollandaise. 



2. ARTICHOKES STEWED 
Trim and prepare the artichokes, remove the 
" chokes," rub some lemon juice round the cavity 
where the choke woe, and parboil in salted water 
with a squeeze of lemon-juice. Drain thoroughly, 
and put into a stewpan in which one ounce of butter 
has been dissolved. Dust with salt and pepper, 
sprinkle with small bits of butter, and let stew slowly 
till quite done. Serve with a rich sauce. 

S. ARTICHOKES STUFFED 
Pl^pare some artichoke bottoms ; boil till tender, 
drain and wipe gently, dust with salt and pepper. 
Place them in a buttered baking-dish ; fill each with 
grated or finely chopped nuts. Strew over these 
some fine crumbs and a little melted butter. Bake 
in a hot oven for about ten minutes, carefully 
basting, and send to table in the same dish. 

ARTICHOKES (JERUSALEM) 

NoTH. — It is an insoluble mystery why these 
extremely easily-grown, cheap, and valuable tubers 
are comparatively little known. I have come across 
very many people who never use them at all ; who 
ha^y, indeed, knew them by sight. They are like

16 MAY BYRON'S VEGETABLE BOOK 

smallish, irregulaily Bhaped potatoes to look at, 
and in actual food-value they stand next to potatoes, 
parsnips being third. They are particularly diges- 
tible, and have a mild, pleasant flavouiof their own ; 
their texture, tooi is pleasing, and their cooking a 
simple matter. The name Jeruaaiem is a corruption 
of the Italian giraaol, meaning a sunflower or heli- 
anthus, to which family the Jerusalem artichoke be- 
longs ; it is not really an artichoke at all. (I should 
imagine that the roots or tubers of all the helianthus 
tribe were edible — if anybody had the courage to 
experiment.) It originaUy came, about 1600, from 
North America, where it was appreciated and cul- 
tivated by the Red Indiana — an appreciation very 
much to their credit. 

Preparation. — Much as for potatoes which are to 
be boiled without their skins. Carefully peel, 
scrape, and wash the artichokes, and blanch them 
in cold water. Some people place them in a sauce- 
pan of salted cold water, like old potatoes ; but in 
the majority of recipes which follow, boiling water 
is indicated. Be cautious that they do not get over- 
done, and become all soft and squashy. Twenty 
minutes' fast boiling should suffice, if they are put 
into boiling water. 

4. ARTICHOKES BAICED 
Peel, wash, and wipe dry one pound to two pounds 
of Jerusalem artichokes. Sprinkle salt over them, 
and let them stand half an hour ; then dry them 
again with a cloth, and put them, in a dripping-tin 
covered with dripping, in the oven till they are quite 
tender and well browned all over. They should all 
be of an even size, or the larger ones can be halved. 
When they are done, drain them and place in a hot 
dish, or round a hot joint ; under which they can be 
baked if need be.

COOKED PLAINLY OR ELABORATELY 17 

5. ARTICHOKES BOILED 
Waah and scrape the desired number of Jerusalem 
artichokes. Cover with boiling salted water and cook 
until tender (about half an hour) ; drain, dust with 
Bait, and set on the back of the range to evaporate 
the moisture. Serve with melted butter, or with 
white or B^hamel sauce. 

6. ARTICHOKES WITH CHEESE 
Boil two pounds of Jerusalem artichokes, drain, 
and mash them up with one gill of milk. (Mashed 
cooked onioQS are an improvement, and yester- 
day's onion sauce is an admirable substitute for 
milk.) Turn the mixture into a well-buttered 
baking-dish, dust the top well with grated cheese, 
and bake till the top becomes coloured. 

7. ARTICHOKES, ESPAGNOLE 
Peel, thoroughly wash and drain twelve Jerusalem 
artichokes ; heat two tablespoonf uls of leaf lard in a 
frying-pan, arrange the artichokes in it, and slowly 
fry for fifteen minutes, or until a nice brown colour, 
turning once in a while ; take up and place in a sauce- 
pan with one gill and a half of demi-glace (No. 704) 
and one tablespoonful of Madeira wine. Care- 
fully mix, season with half a teaspoonful of salt, a 
saltspoonful of cayenne ; cover the pan, then set in 
the oven for fifteen minutes. Remove, place in a 
deep dish, and serve. 

8. ARTICHOKES PRIED IN BATTER 
Peel and wash some Jerusalem artichokes,

ARTICHOKES— CHINESE (OR JAPANESE) 

NoTB. — ^The Chinese artichoke is not, strictly 
speaking, an artichoke at all, but a very pretty little 
tuber, singularly resembling a carved ivory chesa- 
queen. It belongs to the same family {Siachya) 
as the garden Lamb'a-Ear and the wild Betony. 
It is not so much grown as it deserves to be, 
combining, as it does, the triple attractions of 
appearance, taste, and digestibility. To these we 
might add novelty — always desirable where food ia 
concerned. It can be eaten either boiled or fried, 
or raw as a constituent of salads. 

' PrepcmUion. — Little preparation is needed be- 
yond washing and a modicum of trimming. 

In order to retain their charming ivory tint, 
uncooked Chinese artichokes should be carefully 
guarded against exposure to light.

perennial, not an luinnal like the oommoner and 
cheaper vegetables. Its delicate flavour is anique ; 
its nourishing qualities, though not now esteemed 
BO highly as in former centuries, are still considerable ; 
and its appearance has an elegance, a style, a je ne 
taia quoi, which one can scarcely parallel. It affords 
to the consumer a sense of opulence and luxury 
which is extremely attractive in these penurious 
times, and it is tempting alike to the invalid or 
the epicure, though many medical men forbid it to 
the gouty patient. 

I^eparation. — Wash the asparagus, which should 
be freshly gathered ; remove with a sharp knife any 
coarse scales towards the lower end ; tie it up with 
tape into bundles of twelve to twenty-four stems 
each (which should bo far as possible be all the same 
thickness), keeping the heads symmetrically level 
with each other ; and cut the stem-bases level, so 
that every stick is of the same length. 

IB. ASPARAGUS BAKED WITH CHEESE 

One bunch of asparagus, three tablespoonfuls of 
butter, three tablespoonfuls of flour, a quarter of a 
teaspoonful of salt, one cup of white stock or one 
cup of asparagus stock, haU a cup of cream, yolks 
of two eggs, p-ated Parmesan cheese, buttered 
biscuit or bread-crumbs. 

Scrape the scales from the stalks, and wash and tie 
the asparagus in a bunch. Cook in boiling salted 
water until nearly tender, and drain carefully. Make 
a sauce of the butter, flour, seasoning stock and 
cream ; add the yolks and two tablespoonfuls of 
cheese. Stir the sauce until the cheese melts, but 
do not let it boil. Put the asparagus and sauce into 
a buttered, oval bakii^-dish in layers, leaving the 
aspun^us tips at one end of the cUsb and covering 
only two-thirdfi the length of the stalks with sauce.

Sprinkle each layer of aauoe with oheeee, having th 
last layer sauce. Cover with buttered crumbs, ani

18. ASPARAGUS BOILED, No. 2 

It is better to cut and cook asparagus as yoi 
require it ; but if it be bought, put the stems inU 
cold water till you are ready to cook it. The whib 
ends of the stems must be scraped and washed ii 
cold water ; then the asparagus should be tied inU 
small bundles, and placed in boiling salted w&t«

over hot water until the sauce thickens, then 
add two tablespoonfuls of butter in three parts, 
incorporating each part before another is added. 
Lastly beat in a quarter of a cup of thick cream. 
Serve when thoroughly heated. The sauce should 
be thick and frothy. 

20. ASPARAQUS EN BRANCHES

the yolks of three hard-boiled eg^s to a smooth 
paste, add a quarter of a teaspoonful of salt and a 
dash of pepper ; then gradually beat into the egg 
enough butter, softened but not melted, to make a 
sauce of the consistency of mayonnaise dressing. 
Mask the asparagus with the sauce and serve at 
once. B^hamel, white, Hollandaise, and B^rnaise 
sauce (hot or cold) are all used with asparagus. 

31. ASPARAGUS CREAMED 
Take about two dozen good pieces of asparagus, 
and break the stalks into pieces one inch long, or 
cut with a silver knife. Cook them in boiling water, 
slightly salted ; do not put in the tips till the stalks 
are half-done. Have ready some cream sauce, 
made as follows : one pint of cream (or hot milk for 
economy), two tablespoonfuls of flour, the same of 
butter; salt and pepper to taste. Drain and 
serve the asparagus on buttered toast, masked with 
the cream sauce.

BEANS 

KoTB. — ^All sorts of curious superstitions hang 
around the harmless, necessary bean. It has been 
cultivated for countless centuries, but often as an 
object of fear and reverence, rather than for its 
nnquestionable food-value. By certain Greek philo- 
sophers, beanB were associated with the transmigra- 
tion of souls, and hence became forbidden food. By 
the ancient Egyptians, beans were regarded as sinister 
and evil things. By our own " rude forefathers," 
the scent of bean-flowers was considered ominous 
and unlucky. Beans figure largely in folk-lore and 
fairy-tales : ma^ic beans of incredible growth, sic 
ilur ad aatra ; sacks of beans which are exchanged 
for mysterious gifts ; and so forth. Whilst, even 
now, the phrase " to give a man beans " contains an 
occult significance beneath its superficial simplicity. 

The most remarkable bean of all, the soya bean, 
has only been known to Europe about seven years, 
though soya flour has been used for over two thou- 
sand years in the Far East, and is higher than 
wheat in protein value. To the soya bean, and the 
oil extracted from it, some three or four years ago, 
was ascribed the following list of products. I don't

romance can brat this. But to come back to our 
own common-or-garden beans (perhaps we have not 
explored as yet a tenth of their potential value). 

The broad or Windsor bean, that admirable 
legume which is, usually, only to be encountered 
on the humble domestic board — hardly ever upon 
the table of plutocracy — ia indeed a delectable dish. 
Discreetly clad in parsley sauce, and commonly 
companioned with boiled bacon, it is the ideal faro 
of the hungry schoolboy. It has been used a long, 
long while in Britain, whereas the kidney or 
haricot bean— the dwarf French bean — only arrived 
to UB in the early sixteenth century, and the brave 
and beneficent scarlet runner was unknown here till 
area 1600.

All beans are incomparably useful if properly 
cooked. They don't agree with everybody, worao 
luck. The present writer suffers tortures if she rashly 
ventures upon a helping of broad beans, butter 
beans, or haricots. By the way, we have not men- 
tioned butter (or Lima) beans. They are enormously 
employed in the United States of America, either 
fresh or tinned, usually plus pork. " They are," as 
Artemus Ward observed, " a cheerful fruit when 
used tempritly." As they won't grow satisfactorily 
over here, they can only be had in their dried 
form, like dried haricots. They make a welcome 
variety in winter. Haricots are especially nutritious, 
economical, and wholesome. 

Preparation. — (1) Broad (Windsor) beans should 
be gathered and eaten young, or not at all. As a 
rule, they are never procurable in shops until really 
too old for any person of taste. By the time the 
skins are so thick that the beans have to be peeled 
alter cooking they are not fit for human food. 
They should be put into fast-boiling water, slightly 
salted (one aaltspoonful to one quart), just sufficient 
to cover them, and boiled until the skins crack — i.t. 
about twenty-five minutes. I>rain and serve them 
with Sauce Hollandaise, beurre fondu, or parsley 
sauce, in a separate dish. 

(2) French beans should also be used while quite 
young, before they become stringy, boiled whole in 
a minimum of salted water, and served with separate 
sauce as above. Older ones may be sliced and 
boiled in water or stock. The same remarks apply 
to Scarlet Runfaers. 

(3) Haricot beans (dried) should be washed and 
soaked in cold water overnight, then boiled for at 
least three hours. Salt should be added when they 
are half done. Two quarts of boiling water should 
be allowed for each pint of haricots.

and put them into a frying-pan with two ounces of 
melted dripping, two onions cut in rings, half a tea- 
spoonful of salt. Fry the haricots lightly, shaking 
them well. A sharp sauce is a good accompanimeot 
to beans of this kind. 

Bl. HARICOT BEANS STEWED 
Take half a pint of haricot beans, place them in a 
large saucepan with a very little cold water, not 
enough to cover them — the more water you put, 
the less they will be properly cooked. Put the pan 
over a very gentle heat, and let the beans stew gradu- 
ally for three hours ; if they become too dry, add 
occasionally a little more water. When they are 
quite soft, strain them ofi ; meanwhile prepare the 
following sauce. Heat a tablespoonful of dripping 
to boiling point in a frying-pan ; then stir in one 
teaspoonful of flour, and pepper and salt to taate. 
When the mixture has browned a little, add gradu- 
ally one tablespoonful of browning and about four 
tablespoonfuls or rather more of hot water. Let 
the sauce thicken, then pour it over the beaoB.

BUTTER BEANS OR LIMA BEANS 
NOTB, — These are extenBJvely nsed in the 
U.S.A., but we only get them in a dried form. One 
of our greatest seedsman firms has informed me that 
after long and repeated experiments, they have 
almost abandoned the attempt to grow them 
satisfactorily in this climate. Where you can grow 
them, they are called wax-pods while young, and 
are cooked and eaten whole. The following recipes 
are chiefly for fresh beans, where procurable. 
Ordinary bought butter beans must be soaked over- 
night, like harioots, and skinned before cooking ; 
this is no doubt a bother, but their nutritive value 
is very great. 

62. BUTTER BEANS BONNE FEMUE 
Place in an enamelled pan one finely chopped 
onion, two ounces of lean raw ham cut in small 
squares, one tablespoonful of melted butter, and 
nicely fry five minutes, stirring meanwhile ; add one 
pint of shelled Lima beans and half a pint of broth. 
Tie together a very small head of lettuce and two 
branches of paraley, and eidd to the beans. Season 
with half a teaspoonful of salt, three saltspoorifulB 
of pepper, half a saltspoonful of grated nutmeg, 
and lightly mix. Cover pan and let gently boil 
thirty-five minutes, then lift up the lettuce, etc. 
Knead on a saucer one ounce of butter with a hght 
tablespoonful of flour and add to the beans ; gently 
mix without mashing and cook for two minutes 
more. Pour them into a vegetable dish and serve. 

83. BUTTER BEAN CROQUETTES 

Half a pint of dried butter beans, half an ounce 

of butter, one teaspoonful of chopped parsley, half 

a teaspoonful of salt, quarter of a teaspoonful of

38 MAY BYRON'S VEGETABLE BOOK 

pepper, one-eighth of a teaspoonful of grated nut- 
meg, one egg, oil for frying. Soak the beans in 
cold water ovemigbt ; in the morning the skdne 
can be removed easily. Put them into a saucepan, 
with plenty of boiling water and a teaspoonful of 
salt, and boil gently for an hour, or longer, until 
quite tender. 

64. BUTTER BEANS, FERMIERE 
Finely slice two very smaJl, scraped carrots, one 
small white onion, and one ounce of lean salt pork 
cut in pieces ; place in an earthen pot with a tea- 
spoonful of lord, and gently brown for six minutes, 
then add a pint of shelled Lima beans. Tie together 
two leaves of lettuce, one clove of garlic, one l^anoh of 
parsley.and a branch of chervil, and add to the beans; 
pour hot water up to half the height of the beans. 
Season with half a teaspoonful of salt, half a teaspoon- 
ful of sugar, and two saltspoonsful of pepper. Mix 
well, cover the pan, cook on the range for five 
minutes, then set in oven tor thirty-five minutes. 
Remove, lift up the bouquet, add half an ounoe of 
butter, and toss well. Place on a vegetable dish, and 
serve. 

66. BUTTER BEANS AUX FINES HERBES 
Boil a pint of shelled Lima beans in a quart of 
boiling water, with a teaspoonful of salt, twenty-five 
minutes. Drain on sieve, then place in a sautoire 
with an ounce of good butter. Season with half a 
teaspoonful of salt and two saltspoonfuls of pepper. 
Finely chop together two branches of parsley, one 
branch of chervil, ten branches of chives, and six 
tarragon leaves ; add this mixture to the beans, toss 
well in pan, and cook five minutes, frequently toesing 
meanwhile. Transfer beans into a vegetable dtsh, 
and serve.

BEETROOT 

NoTB. — ^This, though you might never think bo, is 
a first cousin of Spinach. It grows wild in Britain, 
as does Good King Henry, another cousin ; and 
has been used with us as an eatable for at least seven 
hundred years. Most people regard beetroot only as 
an ingredient of salads, or to be sliced in vinegar. 
But, baked or boiled and eaten hot like other root 
v^jetables, it is at one© more digestible and, to my 
thinking, more attractive. Owing to the natural 
sugar of beetroot, it is inadvisable for any person 
saffering from gout, rheumatism, or diabetes. 

Preparation. — Great care must be taken not to 
break the skin of beet before cooking it. Wipe it 
gently to remove any soil which may adhere, but 
don't attempt to trim or cut it. Put it into fast- 
boiling water, and let boil from one to two liours, 
according to the size and age of the roots. Then 
remove, drain, and skin them ; some people plunge 
them in cold water to make the skin come oil more 
easily, but if they are to be served hot, this is an 
obvious mistake. Place them in a hot dish, and 
season them with pepper and salt ; add butter or 
gravy, or pour a thick white sauce over them. 

56. BEETROOT BAKED, No. 1 
Put the beetroot without washing it into a slack 
oven, and bake for eight hours. When cold, peel 
it, and serve as above. 

67. BEETROOT BAKED. No. 2 
Boil and peel a good-sized beetroot, cut it into 
thick slices, lay a little piece of butter on each, put 
them in a dripping-pan, and stew in a sharp oven for 
half an hour, basting with butter and lemon juice 
every five minutes or eo. Serve very hot.

68. BEETROOT BOILED 
Boil rapidly antil tender. New beetB will cook in 
on© or two hours ; old beete can hardly be cooked 
enough. When tender, drain and cover with cold 
water to loosen the skins. The skinB Bhould be 
removed with the hands. Season with salt, pepper, 
and butter. If the beets be large, cut into slices. 
Beets left over may be covored with vinegar and kept 
for several days. Beets baked in a hot oven are 
particularly good. When cooked, cut these in slices, 
dress with butter, pepper, and salt. 

69. BEETROOT BOILED (COLD) 
Do not wash the beetroot, for fear of breaking 
the skin, which would make it a bad colour. Place 
it in a large saucepan, completely covered with 
fast-boiling water, and keep the water boiling for 
two hours, or longer if the beetroot is very large. 
When quite cold, skin it thoroughly, cut up in 
slices, and lay them in vinegar, adding salt and 
pepper. At table the addition of a little olive oil 
is an improvement. 

60. BEETROOT CREAMED 
Take two smallish boiled beetroots, cut them into 
□eat rounds, and place them in a pan with a sauce 
made thus : one ounce of butter, one beaten yolk, 
one teaspoonfui of milk, half a teaspoonful of lemon 
juice, pepper and salt tQ,taste. Let the mixture stew 
quietly for ten minutes, and get well warmed through, 
but never come near boiling. Serve at once in hot 
dish. 

61. BEETROOT FRIED 

Cut up a boiled beetroot in thin slices, also one 
onion ; fry both in beef dripping, add pepper and 
salt, (brain, and serye very hot.

63. BEETROOT RAGOUT 
Boil a good-Bized beetroot ; fry an onion, and 
season with salt, pepper, and a teaspoonhil of 
vinegar ; add the beetroot cut into small pieces 
and one cupful of milk, thicken wtth flour, and serve 
very hot. 

64. BEETROOT SAVOURY 
fVy a la^e onion in rings ; cut up a boiled beet- 
root in large dice. When the onion begins to colour, 
add the beetroot, pepper and salt, and three table- 
spoonfuls of tarragon vinegar. Serve very hot. 

6B. BEETROOT STEWED, No. 1 
Make some thickened stock very hot on the fire ; 
add a small parboiled and skiimed beetroot cut 
in thin slices, a spoonful of vinegar, and some 
pepper and salt. Let all boil until the beet is tender, 
but not mashed at all — about one hour. Serve 
very hot. 

66. BEETROOT STEWED, No. 2 
Take two medium-sized cooked beetroots ; peel 
and cat them into dice. Put them in a saucepan 
with just enough hot water to cover them (about 
one pint), add a little salt and pepper ; let them 
stew slowly for fifteen minutes. Mix one table- 
spoonful of cornflour smooth in a little cold water, 
and put this, with one ounce of butter, to the

beetroot, stirrmg well until the corofloor thickens. 
Serve it in a heated vegetable-dish, and sprinkle over 
it one teaspoonful of chopped parsley. 



CABBAGES 

Note. — Cabbage, Kail, Colewort, or by whatever 
name it goes, is a v^etsble of great antiquity in 
Europe. Its name is derived from the Latin Cavlia 
capitatiis, catdia, a stem, and capiU, a head ; and 
hence Cauhflower and all the other English names. 
Cabbages and all their tribe — Borecole, Broccoli, 
Brussels Sprouts, Kohl-rabi, Savoys, etc., etc. — are so 
popular, and so useful, that one can hardly conceive 
of anything to supply their place. The cabbage 
itself is a wild native British plant ; the others have 
been artificially developed by long culture, and 
were gradually introduced into England during the 
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. It seems almost 
comic to think of the cauliflower as s rare and 
precious luxury, but such it undoubtedly was at 
first. What is sold, however, by costermongers at 
2d. each for huge heads, is the hardier and cheaper 
broccoli, which is available from November to June. 

Preparation. — (1) Cabbages, savoys. Remove the 
solid outside leaves, trim stalk, and cut into two or 
four sections ; place in cold, salted water, and explore 
for slugs and other unwelcome guests. Place in 
fast-boiling salted water, with the lid off ; skim from 
time to time, and let boil till tender — fifteen to 
twenty-five minutes. If a httle underdone, or a 
little overdone, cabbages are spoilt. Remember 
to use as little water as possible, and don't throw it 
away, but keep it for vegetable stock. Remember 
also that steaming, though a longer process, is a far 
better one than boiling. (2) Broccoh and cauli- 
flowers should be prepared in the same way, but 



Digitized byGoOgIC 



COOKED PLAINLY OR ELABORATELY 43 

instead of cutting them vertically, cut a deep croBs 
on the base of the etump. (3) Brussels sprouts 
should take about fifteen minutes. Drain any of 
these vegetables very thoroughly before serving. 

67. CABBAGE BAKED 
Wash, trim, and boil a large cabbage. When 
quite tender, drain it thoroughly ; let it be rubbed 
through a sieve and dusted with grated nutmeg. 
Put it into the hot dish on which it will be served, 
gjffinkle it with small pieces of butter, and place it in 
the oven till quite heated through. 

6S. CABBAGE BOILED 
Remove the outside leaves, and cut it in quarters ; 
pick it well and wash it clean ; boil it in water, with 
plenty of salt in it ; when it is tender, and a fine 
light green, lay it on a sieve to drain, but do not 
squeeze it ; if you do, it will take off the flavour. 
^ve ready some very rich melted butter, or chop 
it with cold butter. Greens must be boiled in the 
same way. 

69. CABBAGE WITH CREAM 
Take a good cabbage, wash and trim it, place it 
in fast-boiling salted water, along with an onion 
stuck with one clove. When the cabbage is cooked 
quite tender, drain it (having removed the onion, 
etc.), and pulp it through a sieve. Melt one table- 
spoonful of butter in a stewpan, and stir in the 
cabbage ; season with salt and pepper, and moisten 
with cream. When all is thoroughly heated, dish 
it on buttered toast or fried bread, very hot. 

70. CABBAGE FRIED 

Boil a large cabbage, then chop it up small ; add 

pepper, salt, a little butter, and a small quantity of

melted butter, place it in the oven for five minutes, 
and then serve very hot. 

71. CABBAGE PIEDMONT 
Boil or steam one pound of cabbage. Drain, 
press, and let it get cold. Cook, separately from 
this, eight ounces of mild onions ; let them get 
cold. Butter a baking-dish, sprinkle it with minced 
parsley. Shred in the cabbe^e and onionB in 
alternate layers of each, with a seasoning of salt 
and pepper to each layer, a few little bits of butter 
here and there, and a thin layer of grated cheese. 
When the dish is nearly full, moisten the mixture 
with stock or milk (taking care not to make it too 
wet) till it is level with the top of dish. Brush the 
top with a little melted butter, cook in moderate 
oven for about half an hour, and serve when it is 
thoroughly hot. 

72. CABBAGE (RED) BOILED 
Boil a red cabbage just ^ you would an ordinary 
cabbage ; send it to table with melted butter. 



73. CABBAGE (RED) AS PREPARED IN BELGIUM 
Shred the cabbage very finely, put into a saucepan 
with a large piece of dripping for each cabbage, two 
large onions, two apples cut in slices, a spoonful of 
stock or water, a spoonful of vinegar, pepper, salt, 
and Demerara sugar. Cover and well boil at least 
three hours. When the cabbage is soft, stir with a 
wooden spoon ; mix well ; if necessary, add more 
sugar. Strain and add a piece of butter before 
serving.

75. CABBAGE (BED) FRICASSEE 
Stew a large red cabbage in some stock until 
nearly done ; there must only be enough stock to 
keep it from burning. Drain it, cut the cabbage in 
thick slices, and fry with two onions cut in rings, and 
either two tomatoes or a tahlespoonful of tomato 
sauce. 

76. CABBAGE AND SAUSAGES (FLEMISH)

&ied sausages arranged round the dish. 

77. CABBAGE SAVOtJRY 
Take a good, firm savoy ; clean, and boil it in salted 
water for about a quarter of an hour ; remove the 
water and add fresh boiling water. When the 
cabbage is cooked quite tender, take it out, drain it, 
and let it get cold. Chop it small, and put it in a 
buttered pie-dish. Take half a pint of the first 
water in which the cabbage was boiled, and add one 
tablespoonful of butter, one tablespoonful of flour 
mixed into a smooth paste, pepper and salt to taste. 
Stir all together till thoroughly hot and smooth,

salt and pepper ; let it boil up, and pour it over the 



79. CABBAGE (RED) STEWED 
Wash and trim a good, firm, red cabbage ; quarter 
it, and shred each quarter very finely with a sharp 
knife. Wash the shreds in fresh water, and dry 
them as thoroughly as possible ; first drain, then 
shake them in a cloth, then roll them up in another 
cloth as tight as you can. Melt about four table- 
spoonfuls of butter in a stewpan, place the shredded 
cabbage in, and stew it very gently for about one 
hour. When it is quite soft, add two teaspoonfuls 
of castor sugar, one teaspoonful of salt, three tea- 
spoonfuls of lemon-juice, one small saltspoonful of 
allspice. Mix ; heat up ; and dish. 

80. CABBAGE STUFFED, No. 1 
Take a good-sized savoy, not too firm, and scald 
it till the leaves become soft enough to handle easOy. 
Open it right to the heart. Have ready the following 
mixture : one cupful of boiled rice, salted ; one 
cupful of minced cold meat ; one teaspoonful of 
finely chopped parsley. Continue to place teaspoon- 
fuls of this in the cabbage, beginning with the inner- 
most leaves, and folding them closely over the

pork sausages, and add meat to rice with half a 
teaspoonful of salt, three saltspoonfula of pepper, 
a saltspoonful of grated nutmeg, a teaspoonful of 
chopped parsley, and thoroughly mix with wooden 
spoon. CarefuUy pull back leaves from stalk with- 
out detaching them, then spread a little forcemeat 
over each leaf; close them up to former position, 
then wrap cabbage in a cheesecloth, but not too 
tight. Place it in saucepan with any trimmings of 
veal, beef, or pork at hand, a sliced carrot, sliced 
onion, two branches of parsley, and cover with cold 
water. Season with a teaspoonful of salt and half 
a teaspoonful of pepper ; cover pan and let gently

made as follows : one beaten yolk, one teaBpoonful 
of dry mustard, one tablespoonful of sugar, three 
tablespoonfuls of olive oil, one aaltapoonful each of 
saK and pepper ; mix and cook in a double boiler 
over boiling water, and add very gradually either the 
jnioe of one lemon or two tablespoonfuls of vin^ar. 
Stir thoroughly and let cool. Mix with the shredded 
cabbie. Butter may be used in place of the oU, 
or aour cream and butter to the same amount. 



Note. — Otherwise known as seakale cabbage, this is 
a useful vegetable, which exactly corresponds to its 
name ; for it is a cabbage whose large fleshy mid-ribs 
are removed, and cooked d ia seakale ; while the 
heart and outer leaves may be made into a separate 
dish, d la cabbage. These latter should be used 
first, while absolutely fresh. 

PreparaUcm. — See Cabbage and Seakale. 

87. KOHL-RABI 

Note. — This is sometimes called Jcale-turnip. It is 
a kind of cabbf^e which swells out turnip-shape just 
above the soil. The leaves, which spring from this 
globular plant, are not used ; hut the part itself 
can be cooked like turnips, according to any recipe 
suitable for them ; or it can be boiled in a very little 
salted water till quite tender, and served with white 
sauce, when it will be found excellent. 

Pr&partUion. — See Turnip.

BRUSSELS SPROUTS 

Note. — These admirable little vegetables are 
without doubt the best of all the cabbage kind. 
They represent quality versus quantity, and as a 
winter vegetable are unsurpassed both in flavour 
and appearance. They are so dainty and so delicious 
that it is worth while presenting them upon the table 
with extra care. They should never be served wet 
or squashy, but individually perfect. The smaller 
they are, the better ; and they should be chosen 
BO far as possible all of one size. 

Preparation. — Trim away any jutting stalks or 
discoloured outer leaves, and be most particular 
about washing, as slugs and insects can easily hide 
in these compact little sprouts. 

88. BRUSSELS SPROUTS BOILED, No. 1 
Prepare as above, place in fast-boiling salted 

water (or, better still, in a steamer above it), and let 
them boil fast, uncovered. See that they do not 
float up to the top, and thus get only half-cooked. 
When they are tender without being broken — say in 
ten to fifteen minutes — drain very thoroughly and 
carefully, and serve. 

89. BRUSSELS SPROUTS BOILED, No. 2 
Carefully remove all stale outer leaves from a 

quart of fresh Brussels sprouts. Wash in two 
different changes of water, then plunge into a quart

in a small frying-pan with half an ounce of good 
butter. Season with half a teaspoonful of salt, and 
two saltspoonfuls of white pepper ; gently toss 
them while cooking for two minutes, and use as 
required.

93. BRUSSELS SPROUTS AU GRATIN 
Take small sprouts, as equal in size aa may be ; 
clean and boil them, drain, and pile on a dish. Make 
a good white sauce, and add a little salt and pepper, 
a little cream, and grated cheese. Pour this all 
over the sprouts, dust a few fine rasped bread- 
crumbs over the top, and put into a moderate oven 
for four or five minutes. 

94. LYONS BRUSSELS SPROUTS 
Cook and well drain one pound of Brussels sprouts. 
Fry one tablespoonful of minced Spanish onions in 
one ounce of butter ; when this is a golden colour, 
add in the sprouts ; toss them in the pan for three 
minutes, and serve very hot. 

9B. BRUSSELS SPROUTS STUFFED 
Wash some fine lai^e sprouts and remove the 
centres. Take one pound of well-seasoned pork 
sausages, skin them, and cut them up in pieces 
about an inch long. Put a piece of sausage into 
each hollow sprout, bind it carefully, and put the 
sprouts into fast-boiling stock till tender. Remove 
and drain, and serve at once, thickening the stock 
as a sauce to serve separately. 

CAULIFLOWER AND BROCCOLI 

Note. — The difference between broccoli and 
cauliflower is chiefly apparent to the highly cultured 
palate, and to the working gardener. Most people 
only know these two vegetables apart by the fact 
that they get cauliflowers from March to November, 
broccolis horn September till June ; t.c. cauliflower

COOKED PLAINLY OR ELABORATELY 63 

chiefly in sammer and btocooU chiefly in winter. 
The oooking of them is identical ; but caaliflower 
iB really the more delicately flavoured of the two. 
They are very usefnl and wholesome vegetables. 

Preparations. — See note to "Cabbage." Place 
them upside down in the pan, and be careful to 
achieve the exact amount of boiling ; a cauliflower 
which tumbles to pieces ia only little less objection- 
able than one which is hard and underdone. 

90. CAULIPLOW£R BOILED 
Trim off the outside leaves, and cut the stalk even 
with the edible portion, to stand level. Let stand 
head downward in cold salted water half an hour 
to draw out insects that may be present. Steam 
or cook head downward and uncovered, in a large 
kettle of rapid-boiling, salted water, until tender

is present on the top of the water before lifting the 
cauliflower from the vessel. The cauliflower may 
be tied in a cheese cloth before cooking. Serve with 
cream, white, R^hamel, HoUandaise, or tomato 
sauce. Cooked flowerets of cauliflower are used to 
garnish dishes of veal, chicken, and sweetbread.

GREENS 

NoTB. — Under this heading come a variety of odds 
and ends in the cabbage line, such as broccoli-sprouts, 
ciirled kale, "Scotch Kale," turnip-tops, and other 
young green tope and shoots obtainable in different 
localities. They all can be cooked either like 
asparagus, tied in neat bundles, or like spinach. 
They require careful preliminary picking, trimmii^, 
and washing. Boil them in as little water as possible, 
with the pan-lid off, and drain them as dry as yoa 
can. It is, of course, better to steam than to boil 
them ; this will take a little longer than the boiling 
time, which should be (according to the v^etable 
in question) about seventeen to twenty minutes. 
Serve with a separate sauce. 

113. BBOCC»LI SPROtrrS BOILED 

Tie the stems into bundles like asparagus, having 

first washed and trimmed them. Have ready a 

pan of boiling water, into which has been put two 

tablespoonfuls of salt and a tiny pinch of bicarbonate

of soda. XdBt the broccoli spronts boil fast until 
quite tender ; drain and dish them on buttered toast. 



CAPSICUMS 

Note. — These are little used in the British Isles, 
but largely produced and eaten in oontinental 
countries and the United States. As a rule, the 
small ones only, suitable for salads and pickles, are 
obtainable here ; but the very large ones, which can 
be stuffed before cooking, are much the best for 
culinary purposes. With greengrocers, chillies and 
capsicums are interchangeable terms. They all 
yield pepper, and belong to that strange order of 
the Solanaoee, which supplies qb with so many com- 
modities, from bellfidonna to potatoes. 

Preparation. — Practically as for egg-plant. 

114. CAPSICUMS BAKED, No. 1 
Take two or three green capsicums, cut them in 
two lengthways, scoop out the inside, and place 
them in boiling water for five minutes. Remove, 
drain, and stuff each half with finely minced white 
meat — pork, fowl, or vBal — mixed with the same 
amount of fine crumbs, and add a little salt, lemon- 
juice, and butter. Place the capsicums in a baking- 
dish, let them stand in just enough stock to keep 
them from sticking — say half an inch — and bake. 

116.' CAPSICUMS BAKED, No. 2 
Take largo capsicums, cut off the end of each, and 
scoop out the seeds, etc. Place them in a covered 
pan of boiling water for about fifteen minutes, then 
remove and drain, and stuff with a forcemeat made 
thus : equal quantities of fine crumbs and finely 
minced white meat, seasoning of salt and pepper, 
about one tablespoonful (or more, according to 



Digitized byGoOgIC 



COOKED PLAINLY OR ELABORATELY 61 

requirementB) of butter, 8oft«ned enoogh to mix. 
Place the capsicams in an earthen baking-dieh, 
dredge them with cnimbe, sprinkle some butter over, 
and bake for fifteen to twenty minutes. 

A third method is to fry the capsicums whole 
for one minute in boiling oil or fat, then cut off the 
ends, remove the seeds, etc., and stufF as above, 
or with the addition of nutmeg and thyme in small 
quantities. 



CARDOONS 

NoTB. — These are but little cultivated over here, 
but OQ the Continent six or seven varieties are m 
vogue. Cardoons are so unlike any other vegetable, 
that it is well worth while to try them. They are 
of the same family {Cynara) as the globe artichoke ; 
but, whereas with the latter it is the flower-beads 
which are eaten, the cardoon is blanched like celery, 
and the fleshy leaf-stalk (as in celery) is the edible 
part ; there the resemblance stops, because cardoons 
and celery do not taste alike. 

Preparation. — Cardoons should be cut into lengths 
of four or five inches (removing any prickly parts), 
thrown into boiling water with a squeeze of lemon- 
joice, and kept boiling until their outer skin (which 
is woolly) wiU rub off ; then drain and plunge them 
in cold water. Leave them there till cool, when 
you can scrape them and remove the '* strings." 
After this, you proceed to their real cooking. 

Ilfl. CARDOONS STEWED 
Having prepared as above, lay the cardoons in a 
stewpan (earthen for choice), with a rasher of raw 
fat bacon over them, and another below. Season 
with salt and pepper, add a small bunch of herbs, 
and just cover the cardoons with white stock or 



Digitized byGoOgIC 



62 MAY BYRON'S VEGETABLE BOOK 

milk. Let thia liquid come slowly to boiling-point, 
and then simmer gently till the cardoons are quite 
tender ; probably two houra at least. Lift them 
out and drain them, place them in a hot dish, thicken 
the liquor with & little lemon-juice and egg yolk, 
and pour it over them. 

They can also be stewed in blane (which see) or in 
brown gravy, or served along with marrow. 

CARROTS 

Note. — Although the wild carrot is a native 
British plant, the garden one was not used in 
England until the sixteenth century, when the 
Flemings introduced it. It rapidly grew in popular 
favour, and is now practically indispensable in every 
garden. While not suitable for gouty or rheumatic 
persons, it is a wholesome and palatable vegetable 
i£ properly oooked. Undoubtedly it is at its best 
when very young ; the dainty little carrot newly 
out of the Boil is indeed " a good root," as Mistress 
Quickly termed it, and by no means beneath the 
notice of an epicure. 

Preparation. — Scrape the carrots carefully, but 
do not cut them ; in the case of very young ones 
it is really better not to scrape them, as the mere 
film of skin can be so easily wiped off with a soft 
cloth when they are cooked. Place them in boiling 
salted water, and boil until tender, which will be 
in thirty to sixty minutes, according to age and size. 
Serve in a heated dish, with a little butter, pepper, 
and salt (and some people add chopped parsley). 
Older carrots may be chopped into very small dice, 
or made into a pur^.

CELERY 

NoTB. — Celery, like asparagus and seakale, U a 
wild maritime plant native to Britain ; it may, 
however, be found inland. It is probably as old a 
garden plant as any in cultivation, and is not only 
singularly appetising (its strong aromatic odour being 
as attractive as its flavour), but it is of excellent 
food-value, and to be recommended to those gouty 
and rheumatic folks from whom so many other 
vegetables are debarred. Whether used raw, in salads 
(aee Chap. VIII.), as a flavouring to soups, stews, 
and boiled meats, or as a separate cooked vegetable, 
celery is equally valuable ; and there is nothing in 
the market exactly like it, except celeriac (which 
see), but this latter, being a root and not a stalk, is 
probably less wholesome. 

Preparation. — Remove the outside leaves and 
any disfigured or browned outer stalks, and cut 
away the green parts ; but on no acconnt throw 
these away. Trim the remaining stalks, wash and 
out them up in six-inch lengths, tie in neat bundles, 
as for asparagus, place in boiling, salted water, 
and cook until the celery is tender when tested by 
a fork. Serve in any way suggested for seakale.

season with a teaspoonful of salt and half a teaspoon- 
ful of white pepper ; pour in hot water or broth to 
nearly cover the celery. Briskly boil for five minutes 
on the range. Cover the celery with a sheet of 
buttered paper. S«t the pan in the oven for forty

Remove the outer Btalka and leaves from a good 

head of celery ; wash it well, cut into even lengths, 
and tie firmly in a bundle. Have one carrot, one 
tnmip, and one onion cleaned and cut up small. 
Have two rashera of bacon, cut into four pieces. 
lAy all these with the celery in a stewpan, with a 
lunch of pot-herbs and seasoning of salt and 
pepper. Cover the vegetable with stock — white 
for preference. Let this just boil up, and then 
simmer gently till the celery is tender — about thirty 
minutes. Remove the celery, and dish it on toast, 
with a Hollandaise sauce poured over it, on the 
top of which crumbs and grated cheese can be 
sprinkled and browned in the oven ; or simply 
strain and thicken the stock, browning it if it be 
brown stock, and serve it over the celery and toast. 

128. CELERY BRAISED, No. 3 

Trim away the outside leaves of three heads of 
celery, out the roots to a point, and trim off the

carefully. Tie the beads in a bundle, and put in a 
stewpan with a pint and a half of boiling stock or 
water, or half of each ; add a quarter of a cup of fat 
from the top of the stock, half a carrot, half an onion, 
one teaspoonful of salt, and a few grains of cayenne ; 
oover and let simmer an hour or until tender. I>rain 
out the celery, strain the liquid, and remove the fat ; 
nee the liquid in making about a cup of brown sauce.

For three breakfastcups of pieces make a pint of 
white sauce, using the water in which the celery 
was cooked, with cream as the liquid. Turn all into 
the shell of a Dutch cheese, cover the top with 
half a cup of fine crumbs, mixed with two table- 
spoonfuls of melted butter, and let brown in the 
oven. Serve a light scraping of cheese with each 
helping of celery. For a more elaborate service, 
add parboiled oysters with the celery, and use the 
oyster liquor in making the sauce as a part of the 
liquid. 

130. CELERY AND CHEESE AU GRATIN 
One pint of cooked celery, one pint of white sauce, 
three-qnarters of a cup of grated cheese, three- 
quarters of a cup of fine bread-crumbs, one-third 
of a cup of melted butter. 

Have the celery cut in half-inch pieces before 
cooking. Use the water in which it was cooked, 
with white stock and cream, in making the sauce. 
Put alternate layers of celery and sauce in a but- 
tered pie-dish, and sprinkle each layer with cheese. 
Cover the top with the crumbs mixed with the 
melted butter and any cheese remaining. Set in

thoroughly wash and wipe, then cut into inch pieces. 
Place them in a saucepan with a two-ounce piece 
of Bait pork, an onion with two cloves stuck in it, 
pint of broth, gill of water, teaspoonful of salt, and 
three saltspooi^uls of pepper ; boil for forty-five 
minutes, then take up pork and onions. Mix in 
a saucepan an ounce of butter and one ounce and a 
half of flour ; strain to this the celery broth, and 
sharply mix until it comes to a boil ; add celery, 
with a saltspoonful each of cayenne and grated 
nutmeg ; itiit well, and let boil for ten minutes. 
Transfer celery, etc., to baking-dish ; sprinkle a little 
Swiss cheese over, and set in oven for ten minutes ; 
remove and serve. 

IM. CELERY IN GLASS 
Pare off the green stalks of one fine, large bunch 
ofjwhtte, tender, crisp celery ; neatly trim the roots, 
being careful to save the clear, white hearts. Cut 
each stalk lengthwise into four equal branches. 
Wash them well in cold water, and plunge in clean 
water with a piece of ice until ready to serve ; then 
arrange them in a celery glass and serve. 

1J7. CELERY AU GRATIN 
Cut a lai^e head of celery and boil it in half milk 
and half water till it is tender ; drain and put it into

taate, and sufficient cream or milk to moiaten it 
tiioronghty. Put it in a shallow Btewpan, and 
bring it to boiling-point, but stir it and toss it 
frequently to prevent it burning and ensure its 
gettii^ properly heated. 

139. CELERY SOUFFLE 

Thoroughly wash and strain two stalks of fresh, 
crisp celery ; remove green leaves and finely slice 
stalks. Place in saucepan with sliced white part 
of a leek, a email branch of parsley, a branch of 
chervil, blade of mace and bay leaf. Four in enough 
white broth to cover celery, Bsason with level tea- 
spoonful of salt ; cover pan, and let gently boU for 
thirty minutes. Remove, take out the bay and 
mace, then press celery through sieve into a bow!. 

Mix in a saucepan two tablespoonfuls of melted 
butter, three tablespoonfuls of flour, and pour in 
one gill and a half of milk ; add the purde of celery, 
with an ounce of grated Parmesan cheese and a sait- 
spoonful of cayenne pepper, then briskly stir with 
a wooden spoon until thoroughly boiling ; add two 
^SS yolks, sharply stir for three minutes longer, and 
remove from range. Beat up whites of the two eggs 
to a stiff froth, add to celery, and mix well. Fill

Ul. CELERY STEWED, No. 2 
Cut away the outer leaves of two sticks of celery, 
and lay them in a saucepan with equal parts of 
boiling water and ni'llf to cover them. Boil for 
about two hours, or until tender. Dish up the 
celery. Make some melted butter with some of the 
liquor from the celery, pour over, and serve very 
hot. Skimmed milk alone is better to boil the 
celery in than milk and water. 

U2. CELERY STEWED, No. 3 
Having trimmed the celery, leaving only the 
tender leaves, and washed it, put it into a saucepan 
with boiling water to blanch, and when it has become 
sufficiently tender to yield to the pressure of the 
finger, take it out, and throw it into cold water ; 
then mash it up with a knife in the same way as 
chicory or endive. Put it into a saucepan with a 
bit of butter, a little salt, three or four whole 
peppercorns, and a small quantity of nutmeg. 
Pour upon it about half a pint of mixed stock and 
velout6 sauce ; or, for want of these, water mixed 
with some good gravy, and let reduce until it has 
become thick. It is then to be served in a dish 
garnished with slices of bread fried in butter. 

143. CELERY EN SURPRISE 
Pare off the green branches of two stalks of fine, 
fresh, white celery. Separate all the branches, nicely 
trim the tender parts as well as the roots, and place 
them in a basin with plenty of cold water and wash 
thoroughly. Remove the branches from the basin, 
lay them on a towet, and then with the forefinger 
gently spread a very little green butter on the 
inside of each branch. Dress on a celery dish. 
(Always keep the discarded celery for aoups or for 
other useful purposes.)

CELERIAC 

NoTB. — ^Thifl very good vegetable is also known 
as turnip-rooted celery ; the root, not the stalk, is 
eaton, and a tasty dish it makes. As it Btands 
hard weather much better than celery, and needs 
no blanohing, and will keep well for six months, I 
cannot think why, as a nation, we do not employ it 
more. But we are nothing if not groovy. 

Preparation. — Oeleriac roots can be peeled, quar- 
tered, and blanched before boiling ; cooked and 
sliced in vinegar like beetroot ; sliced raw and 
fried in butter ; boiled and served with sauce ; 
made into a pur^e, etc., etc., etc. 

144. CELERIAC BOILED 

Prepare as above, and place in fagt-boiling, salted 

water, with a squeeze of lemon (to preserve the 

colour). Boil fast till tender ; drain, and serve 

with good white sauce. 

145. CELERIAC STEWED 
Prepare as above ; place in boiling stock, and par- 
boil ; then remove, drain, and put into a stewpan, 
covered with a rich brown sauce. Let simmer 
gently till tender. 



CHERVIL 

NoTB. — ^There are two chervils — one a fine-leaved 
salad herb, and one a bulbous-rooted vegetable, 
rather like a small parsnip in shape and colour, but 
of a quite distinct taste and a more floury texture. 
It is seldom grown, but is advisable as a change. 
Our Anglo-Saxon forefathers used it extensively, 
as do the Continental nations now.

74 MAY BYRON'S VEGETABLE BOOK 

Preparation. — The roota should be washed and 
cleaned, but not cut or scraped. They take long 
cooking, and should simmer, but not boil. 

140. CHERVIL BOILED 

Prepare as above. Put the roots into a stewpsn, 

with a little salt. Pour over them sufficient boiling 

weak stock, or boiling water, just to cover them ; 

let them cook gently for at least one hour and a half. 

147. CHERVIL FREED 
Proceed as above, but when the roots are par- 
boiled, say in about an hour, remove, drain, and wipe 
them dry; cut them into lengthwise strips, and fry 
them a golden brown in boiling butter. 



CHICORY OR ENDIVE 

NOTB. — Either as a cooked or as a salad vegetable, 
chicory is most desirable and wholesome, deserving 
far moie notice than it gets. Both the green leaves 
and blanched stems are edible ; the first are cooked 
somewhat like spinach, the second like seskale. 
The varieties most in commercial use are Witloof, 
or Brussels chicory, and Bathe de Ca'pucin — wild 
endive or succory. This last, boasting one of the 
loveliest blue flowers imaginable, may be met with 
in limestone districts — it is common, for instance, 
in Dorsetshire. 

Preparation. — The young green leaves should be 
placed for five minutes in boiling, salted water, 
drained, plunged into cold water, and drained again, 
as a preliminary to the actual cooking. Use plenty 
of water (salted), as cbicory is apt to harbour insects. 
The blanched stems are treated like seakale (which 
see).

148. CHICORY (BOILED LEAVES) 
Prepare as above. Chop up the drained leaves, 

and have ready in a saucepan a heated mixture as 
follows : to each pound of fresh leaves allow half 
an ounce of butter, quarter of an ounce of flour, and 
seasoning of salt and pepper; mix well, and stir 
over a slow fire ; after about five minutes, add one 
teacupful of white stock or milk, and let all simmer 
till nearly dry. Remove from fire, stir in one ounce 
of butter, and serve with hot buttered toast. 

149. CHICORY (BAKED STALKS) 
Prepare some heads of chicory, by trimming and 

washing them, and boil them in salted water with 
a squeeze of lemon-juice. Drain them as dry as 
possible. Put enough white sauce to cover the 
bottom of a buttered pie-dish, and place the chicory 
in it. If there ia not enough sauce to cover it, add 
a little white stock. Dust thickly with grated 
cheese, and bake in a good oven. 

150. ENDIVE STEWED 
Take four or five beads of endive, break them in 
pieces, mash and drain them. Cook them in boiling, 
salted water over a sharp fire ; when they are tender, 
pass them through a colander, press dry, and mince 
finely. Have ready in a saucepan an ounce of 
butter, seasoned with salt, pepper, and nutmeg ; 
turn the endives into this, and let them simmer 
twenty minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in a little 
cream, and serve on toast or with fried croAtona. 

CUCUMBERS 

NoTB. — These, like most other edible members 
of the great order CvcurbitacMB, such as the 
gourd, melon, vegetable marrow, etc., are widely

76 MAY BYRON'S VEGETABLE BOOK 

diffuBed in locality, and of almost immeasurable 
antiquity, regarded aa cultivated garden vege- 
tables, or fruits, to be quite accurate. Candidly, 
I can't imagine why they have always been so 
popular, because their sustaining and nourishing 
qualities are by no means of the highest. I think 
the rapidity of their growth, and the dispropor- 
tionately large size of their fruitage as compared 
to the plant itself, must have commended the 
Cucumbers and Co. to out remote ancestors in 
all parts of the world. Gourds and melons are 
mentioned in the earlier books of the Bible ; the 
prophet Isaiah speaks of a garden of cucumbers ; 
but there is no evidence that the more valuable 
food-vegetables were held in similar esteem, most 
of these latter, indeed, being principally grown in 
temperate or cool countries. However, here we 
have the cucumber still with ua, and although to 
many people it is synonymous with a violent in- 
digestion, let these sufferers try it cooked and hot 
instead of cold in vinegar, and they may yet respect 
and affect this slim and elegant growth. GherkinB 
are very small young cucumbers pickled. 

Preparation. — Never let the flesh of the cucumber 
come into contact with your fingers whilst you peel 
it, otherwise it becomes bitter and acrid. I believe 
that cucumbers would be excellent plain boiled 
with the peel on (to be subsequently removed when 
they were cooked), or done after any method suitable 
to vegetable marrows ; but this is a theory only. 
Of course, the fresher a cucumber is, the better ; 
you can test this by its being firm and stifi instead of 
feeble and flabby.

or four ounces of veal, and pound or mince it into a 
paste ; add the same weight of bread steeped in 
milk, two beaten yolks, and an eggepoonful of butter ; 
also salt, pepper, and nutmeg to taste. If this 
mixture is too stiff, moisten it with a few drops of 
milk. Stuff the cucumbers with it, and place them 
in a shallow stewpan in which a rasher of bacon has 
been fried. Place around them a few herbs, such as 
a sprig of thyme, three or four sprigs of parsley, and 
a bay leaf, with a couple of cloves, and add enough 
white stock to stew the cucumbers in. Keep the 
lid on, but baste them frequently. They should 
be done in twenty-five to thirty minutes. Dish at 
once, with a rich brown sauce served separately. 



DANDELION 

Note. — It is almost comic to think of consuming 
this constellation of our roadsides, this enemy of 
our lawns ; but the medicinal properties of dande- 
lion, ae a purifier of the blood, are too noteworthy 
to be neglected, and whether as a salad or a culinary 
green-stuff, it should be sincerely recommended. 
The young green leaves can be used raw ; when a 
little older, they can be cooked ; the roots are 
pleasantly bitter, and not unlike salsify when pre- 
pared in a similar way. 

Gather dandelion early in the morning ; and do 
not spare water in washing and blanching it. 

Preparation. — ^The leaves must be welt picked, 
washed in two or three waters, and well drained 
before you start cooking. They can be mingled, 
at pleasure, with an equal amount of sorrel leaves. 
They can be treated as spinach or chicory (which 
see). The roots miut be thoroughly scraped, and

then chop small. Put the leaves into a stewpan, in 
which you have ready mixed one tablespoonf ul of 
stock, one ounce of butter, one dessertspoonful of 
flour, and a seasoning of salt and pepper. Let the 
leaves become thoroughly hot in this, stirring them 
carefully with a wooden spoon for ten minutes or so ; 
then add one tablespoonful of cream, and serve with 
fried crofltons. 

:«3. DANDELION BOILED, No. 2 
Take an equal quantity of young dandelion 
leaves and young sorrel leaves ; chop them separ- 
ately. Put the dandelion leaves into a very small 
quantity of boiling, salted water, cook them till 
tender ; then put in the sorrel leaves, and let boil 
till the water is all boiled away ; add salt, pepper, 
and butter, and serve very hot along with poached 
eggs on toast. 

EGG-PLANT OR AUBERGINE 

NoTB. — Although this ourious plant, which is of 
the Solanam or potato tribe, has been known to 
English gardeners for at least three hundred years, 
it is but little grown or appreciated. One sees it in 
the greengrocers* shops ; but not ae one sees it in 
the French markets. In the United States it is a 
popular and standard vegetable. In India it is 
largely used and termed brivjal. Usually egg-

chiefly led and purple, but also white, cream, and 
violet. A very nice and whoJeaome vegetable it is, 
too ; only most housewives are so mortally afraid 
of anything they dont know previously. 

Preparation. — In almost all caBes the seeds are re- 
moved (unless they ore so young as to be unde- 
veloped), and the fruit is stuffed. The pulp is often 
retained to (he shell or pod, mixed with various 
seasoniimis and ii^^redients.

Cut in two, lengthwise, three small, sound egg- 
plants, criss-oross the flesh inside, without cutting 
skin, then fry in boiling fat, cut side down, and let 
drain for ten minutes. With a teaspoon scoop out 
the pulp, leaving the sheila intact. Finely chop 
pulp and keep on a plate. Heat two tablespoonfuls 
of oil in a saucepan ; add one finely chopped white 
ooion, and gently brown five minutes ; then add 
two ounces of raw rice, with half a clove of finely 
chopped garlic ; lightly brown five minutes, stirring 
once in a while ; add egg-plant meat, with two gills 
of tomato sauce (No. 683), half a teaspoonful of salt, 
three saltspoonfuls of pepper, and saltspoonful of 
nutmeg ; mix well, cover pan, set in oven forty-five 
minutes. Remove, add two egg yolks, thoroughly 
mix, sprinkle half a teaspoonful of salt In the egg- 
plant shells, then fill with the preparation. Sprinkle 
a little breadcrumbs over, place on a tin, arrange 
a few bits of butter over each, set in oven for fifteen 
minutes. Remove and serve. 

172. EaO-PLANT AND TOMATO (ATHtNIENNE) 
Peel a small egg-plant ; then cut into six even 
slices. Neatly trim all round, season with half a 
teaspoonful of salt and two saltspoonfuls of pepper, 
and lightly roll them in fiour. Heat a tablespoonful 
of lard in a frying-pan, arrange the egg-plant slices 
one beside another in the pan, and fry for three 
minutes on each side. Remove and place on a 
lightly buttered tin. Place in a mortar two skinned, 
raw Bausagei, half a teaspoonful each of chopped

parsley and ohives, haU a olore of chopped garlic, 
two tableBpoonfuls of breadcrumbs, half a gill of 
cream, one egg yolk, two ealtspoonfuls of salt, one 
Baltspoonful of oayemie and a saltspoonful of grated 
nutmeg ; then pound the whole together to a 
smooth paste, and evenly spread over the six slices 
of egg-plant. Cut three medium, red tomatoes into 
halves crosswise. Evenly season the cut part with 
half a teaspoonful each of salt and sugar, and two 
saltspoonfuls of white pepper ; then arrange a piece 
of tomato on top of each egg-plant, out side down- 
ward. Spread half a teaspoonful of melted butter 
over the tomatoes, evenly divided, and place in the 
oven to bake for twenty minutes ; remove, dress on 
a hot dish, and serve. 

HOPS 

NOTB. — Young hop shoots, four to five inches loi^, 
make a nice change as a green vegetable, and are 
(in hop districts) extremely cheap. Cold, cooked 
hops are a very good addition to a salad. 

Preparation. — Much as for asparagus — i.e., the 
hops must be slightly scraped, washed, and tied in 
neat bundles — or they can be fried (see below). 

17S. HOPS BOILED 

Prepare as above ; put into salted boiling water 

or weak stock ; boil quickly for about twenty 

minutes ; serve with a good, plain sauce. Reserve 

any which remain till next day, to use cold in salads. 

174. HOPS FRIED 

After preparing as above, boil the young hop 

shoots in salted water with a squeeze of lemon, till 

they are three-parts done — say about twelve minutes ; 

then drain and shake them a little. Leave them to

get cool, after dueting on a little salt. Wben they 
are cold, flour them, dip in egg and breadcrumbs, 
and fry in boiling oil or fat. If any sauce ia served, 
let it be a sharp one ; or hand round a plate of cut 
lemon. 



PINOCCHIO, OR FLORENCE FENNEL 

Note. — As in the case of chervil, there are two 
kinds of fennel — the herb and the vegetable. The 
ordinary aromatic garden fennel (which see) is quite 
another thing from the Italian £noochio, which is 
used like blanched celery, either raw or cooked, the 
thick round leaf-stalks only being employed. 

Finoochio is a particularly pleasing vegetable, and, 
once known, wiU always be wanted, "by reason," 
to quote Parkinson, " of sweetnesse by nature, and 
tendernesse by art." 

Preparation. —As for celery or chicory (which see). 
Stock is better than water for cooking flnocohio. 
It should be served with a rich, thick sauce. 



LEEK 

NoTB. — The national emblem of Wales is closely 
related to the onion ; in other words, it is a plebeian 
member of the great patrician family of the LUiacea. 
It is milder than the onion, and more delicate in 
flavour, even as the onion is milder and less rank 
than garlic. Leeks are good, wholesome winter 
vegetables, and generally find favour as a family 
dish. Like most other vegetables, they are much 
the best when young and tender. 

Preparation. — Well wash the leeks, remove the 
green tops and the fibrous part of the roots ; cut 
Uiem into short, equal lengths, of four to five inches.

COOKED PLAINLY OR ELABORATELY 89 

and plAoe them in faat-boiling salted water for not 
mcnre than six minutes ; then drain ofE the water, 
and substitute a very small quantity of (boiling) 
stock, just enough to cover the leeks in a shallowish 
pan. Let them boil in this until quite tender. 

17S. LEEKS BOILED, No. 1 
Having washed and trimmed the leeks, lay them 
in fast-boiling salted water, and cook till properly 
tender. Drain them, place them in a hot veget- 
able dish on buttered toast, and pour a good white 
■auce over them. 

176. LEEKS BOILED, No. 2 

Take six leeks about as thick as a finger, cut them 
all to equal length, leaving hardly any of the green 
part. Wash and trim them carefully, and tie them 
in a bundle. Place them in a small stewpan, in a 
little salted boiling water, and parboil forfive minutes. 
Drain, and place them in a clean saucepan containing 
three-quarters of a pint of milk and about half a tea- 
spoonful of sugar. Stew them in this for twenty 
minutes or more, till they are quite tender, and lay 
them on slices of toast in a vegetable-dish. Keep 
them warm while you thicken the milk with half 
an ounce each of butter and flour, well worked 
together. Season with pepper and salt. When 
this mixture boils, pour it over the leeks, and serve. 

177. LEEK8 WITH CHEESE 
Prepare the leeks, cut them into three-inoh 

lengtlu, and plunge them in fast-boiling salted water. 
In a few minutes drain oS the water, and replace 
it with just enough good stock to cover the leeks. 
When they are nearly cooked, remove, drain, and 
place them in a pi&'^Ush ; strew them thickly with

90 MAY BYRON'S VEGETABLE BOOK 

grated cheese, and put into a good oven till the cheeM 
is nicely browned. 

178. LEEKS DEVILLED 
Procure twelve even-sized leeks ; trim off stems, 
onter stale leaves, and out green parts one inch from 
white parts, using white parts only. Thoroughly 
wash in cold water and drain on a cloth, place 
in a braising-pan with two branches of parsley, 
a branch of chervil, clove, bay leaf, sprig of thyme, 
and half an ounce of butter. Moisten with half 
a gill of white wine and gill of broth ; season 
with half a teaspoonful of salt and three saltspoon- 
fuk of pepper. Cover pan, and briskly boil on the 
fire for five minutes, then set in oven for thirty 
minutes. Remove to a table, take up with skimmer, 
and split them open without separating. Place six 
slices of toasted bread in a baking-dish ; arrange 
the leeka over toasts ; strain gravy through a cheese- 
cloth into baking-dish ; spread a tablespoonful of 
French mustard and dredge a little breadcrumbs 
over leeks ; then set in oven for fifteen minutes ; 
remove, and serve. 

179. I.EEKS, FRIED 
Take sis small leeks, and use the white parts only ; 
the green tops can be used for soup. Well wash and 
cut them into three-inch pieces. Put into a stew- 
pan with half a pint of milk, one bay leaf, and a pinch 
of mace. Boil slowly till the leeks are soft but 
whole. Carefully remove and drain them. Have 
ready half a pint of thick white sauce, dip each piece 
into this, then stand it in a sieve to set firm. Then 
egg-and-breadcrumb each piece — this must be done 
very carefully, and is better for doing twice. Fry 
in deep boiling fat. Drain the leeks, sprinkle with 
salt and pepper, serve at once.

LENTILS 

Non. — ^Lentils, belonging to the great L^am- 
inoQs family which provides the earth with so 
much food, are not much eaten over here. They 
axe, it would seem, mostly used in a dried state, and 
their nutritious properties are chiefly confined to 
the ripened seed. In France and other Continental 
countries, brown lentils are used ; in Egypt, Syria, 
and the East in general, red ones, such as those 
which the hungry Esau greatly desired in Jacob's 
pottage : " Feed me, I pray thee, with that red " 
(ma^nal reading) ..." Then Jacob >gaTe Esau 
bread and pottle of lentils." 

Whether red lentils be worth one's birthright or 
no, however famished one may be, personally I 
think the brown ones are the best, ^d they are 
supposed to bo particularly nourishing to invalids 
and delicate stomachs ; though undoubtedly in 
aome folk they breed flatulence and dyspepsia. The 
great point is, to have them thoroughly well cooked, 
and no trace of the tough, hard, outer stuns allowed 
to remain. 

Preparation. — Lentils must be soaked in cold 
water over-night, for some ten hours at least. While 
they are boiling, any that float on top should be re- 
moved. It is best to pass them through a sieve, to 
make sure of their being thoroughly pulped. Season- 
ing and flavouring are of much importance. 

180. LENTILS cmtBIED, No. 1 
Take half a pound of lentils ; soak them in cold 
water for three hours, then boil them slowly till 
tmidor, but not mashed. Heat two ounces of 
dripping in a stewpan to boiling-point ; add one 
€0000, &iely minced, one teaspoonful each of salt aDd 
moataid, and one saltspooiihil of pepper. Drain

the lentils as dry as poaaible ; mix them in thoroughly 
with the other ingredients, and after atirring a few 
minutes to get well blended, serve in a hot dish. 

181. LENTILS CURRIED, No. 2 
Fry four onions cut in slices in a saucepan ; add 
one pint of water or stock, and haU a pint of soaked 
red lentils. Thicken with one desseitspoonful of 
curry-powder and one of flour. Simmer for two 
hours, squeeze the juice of half a lemon over the 
lentils, and serve very hot. 

182. LENTILS POTTED 

Take about half a pound of lentils, rather more 
than less. Simmer them in a muslin bag until 
tender, in stock or water. When they are soft, 
beat them to a pulp in a basin, or pulp them through 
a sieve ; and while they are hot, add one table- 
spoonful of butter, half a teaspoonful of powdered 
or finely chopped sage, a piled tablespoonful of fine 
breadcrumbs, salt and pepper. Mix thoroughly 
well and bake slowly for about an hour in a buttered 
pie-dish. Keep the water for stock. 

183. LENTIL PUDDING 

Soak, boil, and mash one quart of lentils ; add 
one ounce of butter, salt, pepper, and as much 
milk as will make it the right consistency. Tie in 
a floured cloth, and boil for dn hour and a half. 

Note. — If any of this pudding remains when cold, 
it oan be cut into thick slices and fried. 

184. LENTILS STEWED (SPANISH) 

Soak one quart of lentils in cold water all night. 

Boil them next day in plenty of salted water for 

three hours. Drain them well ; rub a saucepan

with a clove of garllo ; add one ounce of butter, 
an onion, parsley and herbs minced fine, pepper, 
salt, and the lentils. Stir, and ebake well. In a 
qoarter of an hour dish up, and serve very hot. 



LETTUCES 

NoTB. — Of these wholesome and pleasant veget- 
ables there are two varieties, the cabbage lettuce 
and the cos lettuce (which is called romaine in the 
U.S.A.). Although chiefly used uncooked in salads, 
lettuces can be cooked in various ways with much 
BUCoesB, and the stalks of cos lettuces can be treated 
as asparagus or couve tronchuda (which see). 

Preparation. — Careful washing is necessary, and 
the removal of any discoloured outer leaves ; but for 
culinary purposes, more of the large outside leaves 
can be used — they are often rather tough for salad. 

185. LETTUCES BOILED 
Wash and boil them in boiling water, with a 
little salt, nntil tender ; strain them in a colander, 
and chop them up ; then put them into a saucepan 
with some fresh butter, a spoonful of flour, a little 
nutmeg, salt, and the juice of a lemon ; let the 
whole boil for a quarter of an hour. This may be 
varied by omitting the lemon-juice, adding some 
good cream, and thickening with the yolks of two 
eggs. (This is an excellent plan where lettuces are 
"bolted " and not suitable for serving uncooked. 
Ed.) 

im. lettuces creamed 

Take three large, sound, cabbage lettuces, wash 
and trim them, and throw into fast-boiling salted 
water for ten minutes. Remove and place in cold 
water for a minute or two ; rinse and dry well ;

oat each into quarters, and put them in a Banoepan 
with one tablespoonful of butter, and seaBoniug of 
pepper and salt, and one saltspoonful of castor sugar. 
Let simmer very slowly for two and a half to three 
hours, stirring often, until the lettuces are quite 
tender ; then add two yolka beaten up with about 
half a gill of cream or new milk ; let s immer but not 
boil, and serve very hot, with garnishing of fried 
crofitons. 



187. LETTUCES STCTFED 

Choose some large cabbage lettuces, and, having 
boiled them a quarter of an hour, dip them into cold 
water and let them drain ; then open the leaves 
without breaking them, and fill the centre part with 
a good forcemeat, and tie them up ; stew them for 
a short time, then drain them on a cloth, dip them 
in a batter, and fry to a good colour. When done, 
cover them with breadcrumbs, and serve with some 
white sauce. 



MERCURY, OR GOOD KING HENRY 

Note. — This good old-fashioned plant, also known 
as Lincolnshire asparagus, fat hen, blite, shoe- 
maker's heels, etc., ia an aboriginal inhabitant of 
Britain. It ia so cheap and wholesome, so simple 
and easy to cultivate and to cook, that I suppose 
we neglect it as too cheap. It makes an exceUent 
substitute for spinach, if allowed to grow large ; 
or, if the young shoots are cut and boiled in bunches, 
it has a distant resemblance to asparagus. In any 
case, mercury is by do means to be despised, and 
I commend it as a useful spring vegetable, though 
not of the first class.

MUSHROOMS 

NoTB. — Properly speaking, these can hardly be 
termed vegetables, except in ao far as they are 
□either animal nor mineral. On the Continent, a 
very large variety of mushrooms are recognised as 
edible ; in Great Britain, although possessing 
thirty edible species, we only make use of two. 
These are the common meadow mushroom {Agarieua 
eampesiria) and the horse mushroom (Agarieua 
ctrveatris). Hardly anybody dares to experiment 
with the fairy-ring champignon, the chanterelle, 
the blewit, the morel ; with the St. George's mush- 
room, the English truffle, the giant puffball, and 
other delioioas esculents. 

However, a einister suggestion of poieon lurks

vithin the rosy gills of even the meadow mushroom, 
when those gills turn black ; and I warn you not to 
make use of any agaric, once its flesh darkens. 
Unless fresh, it may be dangerous. 

Preparation. — Use a silver knife. Remove very 
gingerly the outer skin, and the stalks ; the latter 
should be chopped, rinsed, and simmered in milk 
or water to make sauce. Good mushrooms should 
need no trimming, nor should they break under 
the hand. 

As a separate dish, as a garnish, as a flavouring, 
mushrooms are particularly savoury and attractive. 



190. MUSHROOMS BAKED, No. 1 
Carefully peel the mushrooms, and put them, 
hollow-side uppermost, on a buttered baking-sheet ; 
flll the cavities with butter, and set in a moderately 
hot oven. They should be ready in about twelve 
minutes. It will be seen that they must be fairly 
whole mushrooms, not stale or broken ones. 



191. MUSHROOMS BAKED. No. 2 
Place in a pienilish some good, medium-sized mush- 
rooms, underside up, and place on each a little

Take some middle-sized mushrooms, peel and 
trim them, fry them gently in a little butter. Place 
each on a Bmall piece of toast, sprinkle with salt 
and pepper, and keep hot. Have a paste made 
with one ounce of butter, two teaspoonfuls of finely

all worked quite smooth. Put a piece of this into 
the middle of each mushroom, and serve very hot. 

m. MUSHROOMS CURRIED 
Take about a dozen good-sized mushrooms for 
this. Fry a small, sliced onion pale brown, using 
about one ounce of butter ; mix in one teaspoonful 
of flour and two teaspoonfuls each of curry-paste and 
curry-powder. Continue to fry lightly for five 
minutes longer ; then add one teaspoonful of 
chutney, one saltspoonful of salt, and about one 
pint of stock. Let all cook quietly for about fifteen 
minutes ; then strain the liquor off, return to the 
pan, put in the mushrooms, and simmer them 
quickly for about half an hour. Serve them inside 
a wall of boiled rice, like a meat curry.

199. MUSHROOMS AU GBATIN, No. 2 
Take e^ht or ten large cup mushrooms. Cut off 
all the stalks and peel them, and also peel very 
carefully the cup-like part of the mushroom, so as 
not to hurt the rim. Next scoop out the inside of 
these oups, and chop it up with the stalk of the 
mushrooms. Take a piece of shallot about aa big 
as a large nut, a teaspoonful of chopped parsley, 
and a very little chopped thyme, with a little cayenne 

Spper ; add about three ounces of streaky bacon, 
: and lean. Put all over the fire, and h-y for a 
time. If the mass is too dry, it shows there is not 
enough bacon-fat ; if it be too moist, add bread- 
orumbs. Fill the oups of the mushrooma with this 
mixture, and shake over some fine bread-raspings. 
Hace the cups so prepared in a covered stewpan, 
with some butter or oil, and let them cook very gently 
till the cup part of the mushroom is quite tender. 
Serve hot, with toast, either plain or with some rich 
brown gravy poured round them.

201. MUSHROOMS SCALLOPED, No. 1 
Take a medium-sized pie-dish ; butter it, sprinkle 

the bottom thickly with hne breadcrumbs ; strew 
little bits of butter over, and moisten very slightly 
with milk. Have ready some sound mushrooms, 
peeled and trimmed ; put a layer of these and one of 
crumbs and butter, alternately, till the dish is

of tooat or fried bread. 

204. MUSHROOMS STEWED, No. S 
Look carefully over each mushroom by breaking 
it in half, to ascertain if it be worm-eaten ; if so, 
reject it. No fungus is more poisonous than an 
old worm-eaten mushroom. Having ascertained 
that they are sound, wash them in strong salt and 
water ; dry and wipe them, and place them in a 
saucepan with one ounce of butter (or more, in 
accordance with the quantity of mushrooms), some 
milk, pepper, and salt. Simmer slowly or bake in 
a covered jar for one hour. Look at them fre- 
quently, and add more milk if necessary. Have 
ready some hot fried toast, lay the mushrooniB on 
the toast, and serve very hot. 

20fi. MUSHROOMS STUFFED 
Remove the stalks (and keep them) from one 
pound of very fresh, good-sized, sound mushroomB ; 
wash in cold water, and carefully drain on a cloth. 
Heat one tablespoonful of melted butter in a frying- 
pan ; place the mushrooms in a pan one beside 
another, and cook for three minutes on each side. 
Squeeze over juice of half a sound lemon, sprinkle 
over half a teaspoonful of salt, toss well, and keep 
on a plate till required. Thoroughly wash the 
mushroom stalks, chop very fine, place in a small 
saucepan with one ounce of butter, three finely 
chopped shallots, one ounce of chopped raw bam, 
and gently brown for ten minutes, frequently 
stirring meanwhile ; add one tablespoonful of fiour ;

saltspoonful of grated nutmeg ; mix with wooden 
epooD until it comes to a boil ; then add two table- 
spoonfuls of fresh breadcrumbs, one egg yolk, and 
mix well while heating for three minutes. Transfer 
this preparation to a plate, and let it get cold ; then 
stuff mushrooms with the preparation, neatly smooth 
tops, carefully dip in melted butter, then in bread- 
crumbs ; place on a tin, set in oven for eight minutes ; 
remove, and serve. 



NASTURTIUMS (TROP^OLUMS) 

Note. — Three kinds of nasturtiums are used as 
vegetables : the climbing TroftEolum majus, the 
dwarf T. minus, and the half-hardy and very 
beautiful T. tvberoeue, with its slender red-and- 
yellow flowers. The great merit of majua and minus 
is that they will grow pretty nearly anywhere, and 
seem almost to enjoy poor soil. When one considers, 
too, that they are naturally Peruvian plants, it is 
extraordinary with how little sun they can subsist. 
The green leaves can be treated as a cooked veget- 
able ; the tips of the shoots and the green seeds can 
be added to salads ; and the green seeds, pickled in 
vinegar, make an efiective substitute for capers. 

T. tvberoeus has small, curious, potato-like tubers, 
which are edible, but not certain to bo appreciated, 
unless you have become acclimatised to the taste 
for them by habitation in South America. 

Preparation. — Leaves, a^ for spinach ; tubers, 
probably as for new potatoes.

NETTLES 
Note. — ^These despised " weeds " are of excellent 
worth, both for nmking nettle beer or for using as a 
culinary vegetable. As nothing can possibly be

ohe&per, nor more wholesome, it is advisable to 
KnU ODOseU of nettles ; but please note that you 
can only eat the young and tender shoots. Tliey 
must never be gathered after the nettle has flowered. 
Pre'paration. — The young shoots must be washed, 
dried in a cloth, and tied in trim bundles like 
asparagns. Use several waters in the washing. 

206. NETTLES BOILED 

Young nettle sprouts, about six inches high, are 
not only invaluable for that wholesome beverage 
nettle beer, they can be advantageously utilised 
as a vegetable. Wash them well, put them in fast- 
boiling, salted water, and cook about fifteen minutes. 
Drain off the water, leaving the nettles as dry as 
possible ; work in one ounce of butter, and seasoning 
of salt and pepper, keeping the pan over the fire. 
Have ready some buttered toast, and serve the 
nettles on this, placing poached eggs on the top. 

207. NETTLES STEAMED 

Prepare as above, and cook in s steamer until 
tender, say about twenty minutes. Drain and 
untie, arrange neatly on a hot dish or on buttered 
toast ; sprinkle with salt and pepper, and serve with 
a simple sauce, such as beurre foiidu. 

208. NETTLES AU GBATIN 
Wash, dry, and string some young nettle shoots. 
Put them into cold water, salted a little, and let 
this come to boiling-point ; then strain off the water, 
but do not press the leaves too hard so as to break 
them. Butter a pie-dish, sprinkle it with fine bread- 
ommbs, grated cheese, and seasoning of pepper and 
ealt. Place the nettles on this, and cover them with a 
similar layer ; strew small pieces of butter over,

and put into a moderate oven for about a quarter 
of an hour. 

209. NETTLES STEWED 

Take some young nettle-sboote ; wash, dry, and 
chop them very Bmall. Place in a stewpan with 
one email finely chopped onion, half a teaspoonful 
of castor sugar, and Beasoning of salt and pepper ; 
add sufficient stock (or water, if no stock be avail- 
able) just barely to cover the nettles ; more can be 
added if this boils away. Put at the side of the fire, 
and let stew very gradually till tender ; then add 
a thickening of butter, flour, and cream, or milk, and 
carefully mix it in. Serve on buttered toast, and 
put rings of hard-boiled egg on top. 



ONIONS 

Note. — ^These rank among the oldest vegetables 
in the world. Almost m^ical healing properties 
have been ascribed, in all ages and countries, 
to these pungent bulbs. They were considered 
actually sacred in ancient Egypt. They are 
of the same family as lilies ; which shows how 
mach kinsfolk may differ. Onions are exceedingly 
wholesome, nutritious, and appetising if thoroughly 
cooked ; an underdone or raw onion is only 
digestible by a strong, outdoor personage. The 
young spring onion, known as "gippo" in the 
West country, is an excellent addition to salads, but 
almost impossible to forget once you have eaten 
it. The large Spanish onion is the least pertinacious 
as regards its lingering taste and odour. Probably 
onions boiled are the safest ; fried, the most in- 
digestible ; and baked, the tastiest. 

Their extraordinary effect upon the lachrymal 
glands would suggest an equally powerful effect

COOKED PLAINLY OK ELABORATELY lOfl 

upon the internal organs. They have this great 
advantage, that being neither rootB, tubers, nor in 
any sense farinaceous, they are not taboo for gouty, 
rheumatic, or diabetic people. 

It is adviBable to peel onions in a draught, 
or close to the fire, to dispel some of their powerful 



Preparation. — Remove the stalk, close against the 
bulb, and take ofi one or two of the outer skins, till 
you approach green skin. Place them at onoe in cold 
water, slightly salted, and let it come to boiling- 
point ; strain it ofi, and place the onions in another 
pan of salted, boiling water (if it be boiled), or pro- 
ceed with any other selected process. By the above 
means you will ensure their being not only blanched, 
but well cooked. 

210. ONIONS BAKED, No. 1 

Feel three medium, sound Spanish onions, clip off 
a small piece at both ends, cut in two, crosswise, 
and arrange in a baking-dish cut side up. Mix in a 
bowl an ounce of butter, a teaepoonful of chopped 
parsley, a saltspoonful each of salt and pepper, and 
the juice of half a sound lemon. Spread this mixture 
evenly over the six half-onions, cover with a 
buttered paper, and set in oven for thirty-five 
minutes, being careful to baste quite frequently. 
Bring dish to oven door, and lift up paper ; Bprinkle 
over two tableepoonfuls of fresh breadcrumbs, baste 
well ; reset in oven for ten minutes more ; remove, 
and serve in same dish. 

211. ONIONS BAKED, No. 2

slowly over the fire for two hours ; then remove, 
drain, and take off the skins. Put them in a large 
pie-dieh, and season each onion with salt and pepper. 
Place a large piece of butter on the top of each, 
dredge thickly with fine brcadcrumba, and bake in 
a sharp oven to a deep golden brown. They are 
better served in the same dish ; a fire-proof one is 
advisable, as it looks best, besides keeping hotter. 

212. ONIONS BAKED, No. 3 

Put four or five Spanish onions, with their skins 
on, in a saucepan of salted water ; let them boil 
quickly for one hour. Then take them out, dry 
them thoroughly, wrap each one separately in a piece 
of buttered paper (or a paper bag), and bake them 
in a moderate oven for two hours or longer. Remove 
the paper and serve the onions in their skins. 

213. ONIONS BAKED, No. 4 

Put some onions in a deep pie-dish (after removing 
the outside skins), salt and pepper them, and place 
a piece of butter on each onion ; cover them over, 
and place them in a hot oven for about three hours 
and a half. 

214. ONIONS BOILED, No. 1 

Unless the oniona be very mild or young, when 
boiling change the water two or three times, re- 
plenishing each time with cold water and draining 
when the boiling-point is reached. Cook until very 
tender. Drain and serve with butter or cream or a 
white sauce. Onions left over may be cut in thin 
slices and disposed In a buttered gratin dish in 
layers with white sauce, then covered with buttered 
crumbs, and set in the oven, to reheat and brown 
(be crumbs. Onion pur^ is particularly good with 
mutton chops.

Take two pounds of middle-sized onions, peel 
them, and put into a pan, with one teaspoonful of 
white sugar, and just cover them with boiling water. 
Let them boil till nearly tender ; then put in one 
teaspoonful of salt, and let them boil till done. 
Drain off the liquor. Have ready a sauce as follows : 
mix one tablespoonful of flour into one ounce of 
melted butter ; when this has heated for two 
minutes, stir in half a pint of hot milk, and heat for 
two minutes more ; add salt and pepper to taste ; 
Htir well, and pour it over the onions in a hot veget- 
able dish. 



217. ONIONS AU GRATIN, No. 1 

Take one pound of Spanish oniona, boil soft, and 
mince small. Have ready two ounces of grated 
cheese. Take a butterrd baking-dish, cover the 
bottom with onion, then put in layer of grated cheese, 
and pepper and salt to taste. Repeat in alternate 
layers till the dish is full. The top layer must be 
cheese, which should be sprinkled with butter or 
dripping, dusted with breadcrumbs or flour, and set 
in a good oven for ten minutes.

Take four good-sized Spanish onions, and blanch 
them in boiling, salted water for ten minutes. Drain 
and cut them up ; put them in a stewpan with just 
enough milk to float them. Simmer over a low fire 
till tender ; then drain all mixture through a sieve. 
Use the liquid thus obtained to make a sauce, with 
two ounces of butter and half an ounce of flour, 
mixed smooth into one tablespoonful of milk, one 
yolk, pepper and salt. Put the onions into a hot 
buttered dish ; mix the sauce well in, strew a layer 
of grated cheese over, and a little butter (melted) od 
top. Bake a few minutes until coloured. 

219. ONION SOUFFL^ 
Melt one tablespoonful of butter in a saucepan, 
and add one tablespoonful of flour, quarter of a tea- 
Bpoonful of salt, and a dash of paprika. When 
smoothly mixed, add one cup of milk. When the 
sauce boils, add half a cup of stale breadcrumbs 
(from centre of loaf), a teaspoonful of chopped 
parsley, one cup of cold, boiled onions, chopped fine, 
and the yolk of an egg well-beaten. Beat the 
whites of two eggs very stiff, and fold them into the 
onion mixture. Bake in a buttered pudding-dish, 
in a moderate oven, about fifteen minutes. Serve 
at once, with or without cream sauce. 

220. ONIONS STEWED 
Take two large Spanish onions, roll them in a 
little flour, and fry them whole in a stewpan with 
as little dripping as possible. When they are a light 
brown, add half a teaspoonful of Liebig's Extract or 
Bovril, dissolved in one breakfastcupful of hot water. 
Let all come to boiling-point, then cover the pan and 
stew slowly for two hours or so. The liquor must 
be thickened with a little flour.

221. ONIONS STUFFED, No. I 

Take some medium-sized Spanish onioDS, scoop 
out their centres, and let them boil ten minutes ; 
then drain, and stuff with the following mixture : 
eight ounces of sausage meat, and seasoning of salt 
and pepper, half a saltspoonful each of grated 
nutmeg and powder«i thyme. The onions will 
probably need binding. Place them in a shallow 
stewpsn, with one small carrot thinly sliced, and 
the Bcooped-out centres finely chopped ; add half a 
pint of stock, and cover the pan with lid. I^et the 
onions stew very gently for about one hour, and 
look occasionally to see U the liquor has boiled away, 
when it can be replaced with the same amount of 
boiling water. When the onions are a good brown 
and quite tender, put them in a hot vegetable-dish, 
strain and thicken the gravy, and pour it over them. 

222. ONIONS STUFFED, No. 2 
Parboil three large Spanish onions, take out the 

centres, and fill up with the following mixture : 
a quarter of a pound of finely chopped cold meat, 
one ounce and a half of grated cheese, the scraps of 
onion, chopped, and a seasoning of pepper and salt. 
Place a sniall lump of butter on the top of each, and 
fry or bake the onions in hot fat. Serve very hot, 
with a thick gravy.

in the onions with the mixture. Put in a battered 
baking-dish, sprinkle the top with three-quarters of a 
oup of fine dry crumbs, stirred into quarter of a cup 
of melted butter, and bake about twenty minutes, 
basting carefully with a little butter and hot water. 
The onions may also be stuffed with pork sausage. 
Thus stuffed, they become an appropriate garnish for 
roast turkey or spare-rib of pork. 



PARSNIPS 

Note. — The parsnip is a native British plant, but its 
use aa a cultivated vegetable in Britain is only some 
four hundred years old, although it was a familiar 
viand in Roman households. Parsnips stand third in 
dietetic value among culinary vegetables, but, owing 
to the sugar they contain, must be barred by gouty 
and rheumatic persons. They require to be sup- 
plemented by a rich sauce, or plenty of oleaginous 
matter, for, according to the familiar old adage, 
" Fine words butter no parsnips." To many people's 
thinking, they are better boiled, and then fried, 
than any other way. A remarkably potent and 
pungent wine is meuie by cottagers from parsnips. 

Preparation.— Parsnips should not be out before 
being cooked, or they will deteriorate by at least 
half their value. Choose, therefore, small or 
medium-sized ones, as even in size as possible. 
Scrub them thoroughly in cold water, and either 
steam them, or place in boiling, salted water, as little 
of it as possible, and let them boil fast till tender, 
which should be about one hour and twenty minutes. 
Serve them whole.

PEAS 

NoTB. — Peaa have been cultivated so long in 
Europe, that they are found in the remains of 
Bronze Age dwellinga. Whether eatpcn green or 
dried, their value has never been in any doubt. In 
the former condition they are more appetising ; in 
the latter, more nutritious. The great Leguminous 
family, which includes beans, peas, lentils, etc., etc., 
is perhaps the most varied tribe in the worid. It 
contains about 6,500 species ; its members exist in 
all parts of the known world, except in St. Helena 
and one other small island. They range in size 
from tiny insignificant herbs to great trees whose 
tninka have a girth of 80 feet. Peas, beans, and 
lentils, already named, supply enormous quantities 
of human food ; cloves, vetches, and lucernes, pro- 
vide endless fodder for cattle ; senna, liquorice, 
tolu balsam, tamarinds, catechu, gum Arabic, manna, 
indigo, rosewood, logwood are included ; with an 
immense variety of other useful growths, and 
ornamental ones including furze, broom, mimosa, 
sensitive plant, and the greenweed or plants 
genista from which our Angevin kings derived 
their surname. 

All this may or may not be relevant to a cook- 
book ; but it is undoubtedly very interesting. 

Preparation. — (1) If you are fortunate enough to 
have your own young green peas, freshly picked from 
your own garden, shdl them, and place them in a 
shallow Btewpan, in fast-boiling salted water (one 
teaspoonful of salt to one pint of water), barely 
sufficient to cover them. Don't put in sugar, or 
soda, or mint, or parsley, or butter, or anything. 
Keep the pan-lid off, and let the peas boil fast till 
they are tender, about ten minutes ; then drain and 
serve in a heated dish.

But this is a couiuel of perfection aa to the beet 
way of dealing with the best peaa. 

(2) Foi eecond-beet peas — which include all those 
which have be«j bought, and whose freshnees you 
cannot guarantee — you may add two or three leaves 
of mint, a B'mall spiay of parsley, a tump of sugar, 
an ounce of butter, a Bmall onion or a few chives ; 
but be careful to use as little water as possible. 
These peas will, of course, take longer to cook. 

(3) Old peas are most eatable when " jugged," 
in a tightly stoppered jar set in boiling water. 
Butter, pepper, salt, and sugar should be added 
to thent, but no water. They will take at least 
forty-five minutes. 

(4) Dried peas must be well picked and washed, 
and soaked in cold water for eight hours, or over- 
night, before you attempt to cook them. Dried 
green peas are more palatable than yellow split 
ones. 

(5) Pea-poda, when very young, may be boiled 
whole as directed in the first instance. When 
older, they can be " topped and tailed " and sliced 
on the slant, like French beans, and boiled a good 
while in a minimum of water. In this way, also, 
you secure a good basis for green or v^etable soup. 



233. PEAS (AVIGNONNAISE) 
Place a pint of fresh, tender, ehelled peas in a

If the pods are clean and freeh, cook part of them, 
with water to cover, half an hour. Strain the water 
throngh a cheese cloth, reheat, and use as the liquid 
in which to cook the peas. Freshly gathered tender 
peas should cook in twenty minutes. In cooking 
peas, use no more liquid than it takes to cover them ; 
season with salt, pepper, and butter. Cream, broth, 
or meat extract may be added. A little sugar is 
sometimes an improvement. Cubes of carrots, 
cooked separately, also may be added to a dish of 
peas. Peas alone, or combined with carrots, turnips, 
and potato^, are also served in cream sauce or in a 
carry sauce.

bottle or any jar with a closely fitting top, adding a 
tableepoonfal of butter, a teaspoonful of powdered 
mgar, a saltspoonfui of salt, a dozen mint leaves, 
and, at discretion, a very little black pepper. 
Cover the vessel tightly, and immerse it, to the extent 
of half its depth, in a pan of boiling water. Set the 
latter on the fire and boil briskly. Examine in half 
an boar. The peas, if very young, should be done by 
then ; if old, they will of course take longer.

POTATOES 

Note. — ^Nobody regards the potato as romantic, 
and yet it belongs to the most romantic (in a sinister 
sense) of all tribes. It is a member of the great 
Solanaceffi order, which contains six hundred species ; 
a couBin of the Three Fates of Poison — deadly night- 
shade, henbane, and thorn-apple or stramonium. Its 
very blossoms would tell you this, they are so similar 
to those of the woody nightshade. Solanum tubero- 
sum, the common or garden potato, the most 
valuable food-vegetable in existence, the staple diet 
of miUiona, stands as a crowning instance of extremes 
meeting. 

The " Potato of Vi^nia " was originally intro- 
duced to Britain byone Herriot — blessed be his namel 
— though Sir Walter Raleigh, in a vague way, getA 
the credit of it. But Sir Walter's fame is quite great 
enough to let even the potato go. . . . Its name 
is derived, through the Spanish peUata, from the 
native Red Indian term bateUa ; and it was not fit 
first recc^jnised as of any special culinary or dietetic 
value. Nearly two hundred years elapsed before it 
rose to its presott proud position ; and now, one 
cannot imagine how it can ever be superseded. The 
two vegetables which meet nearly approach it in

importEuiM, the J«nisalem artichoke and the pan- 
nip, are far behind. Solatium tuberoeum — poisonoofl 
of froit, and preciooH of tuber — ^ia one of the best 
gifts of the Creator to a world bo etrangely mixed of 
good and bad. 

I have devoted the largest amonnt of space to 
potato dishes, because they are not merely alterna- 
tives, or wholesome extras, or valuable for medicinal 
reasons ; they are solid, senaible food — you can live 
on potatoes atone. I don't think one can say this 
of anything else, exc^t plantains or bananas, and, 
of course, wheat. ^ft,^:.,^^'^ 

Preparation.— The most valuable ^animal salts of 
the potato lie closely next the skin ; it is therefore 
utterly wasteful to prepare it in the too frequent 
fashion, by peeling it and letting it lie in cold water. 
The bulk and quantity remain {though even these 
are deteriorated by peeling), but the most essential 
qualities ate gone for ever. Potatoes should always 
be boiled (or, far better steamed) in their skins, a 
preliminary cleaning and scrubbing being given. 
The flavour is enhanced, the mineral salts are re- 
tained, and much waste in labour and material is 
avoided. 

The potato is one of the only vegetables (the 
others being Jemaalem artichokes, sweet potatoes, 
and yams), which is placed in cold water and allowed 
to come to boiling-point. With new potatoes, this 
role is reversed ; they must be rubbed or gently 
scraped until the thin akin comes off, and then placed 
in boiUng salted water. Always choose potatoes so 
far as possible of one size. To render potatoes 
mealy (if for some reason yon must peel them), 
it is inevitable that you pour oS the water when 
they are just cooked, and leave the lid on ajar, so. 
that they shall finish themselves by the process 
of steaming. Very old potatoes may be peeled, 
and the eyes, with any bruised-lookiDg parts.

removed ; place them in cold salted watei. and, when 
it haa boUed, let simmer for about twenty minntes. 

Potatoes cooked in their ekins should be boiled 
till the ekins crack ; then drain off the water, 
cover the potatoes with a clean cloth, and leave the 
pot near the fire for a quarter of an hour or bo before 
dishing up. 

New potaiota should be freshly dug if possible ; the 
flavour of a new potato just out of the ground is a 
totally different thing to that of a foreign imported 
one — in fact, I do not consider the latter worth 
eating. Even those English new potatoes which 
have been lying about in market-baekets for a day 
or two are considerably deteriorated. The skins, 
as aforesaid, sbonld be carefully scraped, not peeled 
off. A potato that " will not scrape " is a foreign 
and inf^or one. Put the potatoes into salted 
boiling water, with a sprig of mint. When they 
are si^ciently cooked, drain off the water, add 
about a teaspoonful of milk and a piece of butter the 
size of a walnut, shake the pan over the fire till the 
butter is well melted, and mixed with the potatoes. 
Place them ux a hot v^etable dish, and dust with 
pepper and salt. 

2M. POTATOES. ANNA, No. 1 

Peel, wash, and drain four good-sized, sound, ra^ 
potatoes. Slice them with a potato machine ; or, 
if none is at hand, sUce them as fine as possible. 
Grate two ounces of Parmesan or Swiss cheese. 
Heat one ounce of butter in a small frying-pan, 
remove the pan from the fire, and cover the 
bottom with a light layer of potatoes. Mix a tea- 
spoonful of salt with two saltspooniuls of white 
pepper, sprinkle a very little over the potatoes, and 
place a few little bits of butter over the cheese. 
Arrange another layer of potatoes — and so on till 
all are employed. Cover the pan and place on a

moderate fire for five minQtes. Turn them over with 
a cake turner, let them cook again for three minutea, 
and then place in the hot oven for ten minutea. 
Remove them from the oven, turn on a hot dish, 
and serve. 

285. POTATOES. ANNA, No. 2 
Pare 'the potatoes, and cat them lengthwise 
into slices one-fourth an inch in thickness; care- 
fully put the slices together, to retain the original 
shape of the potato, and then run two wooden 
toothpicks, dipped in melted hutter, through each 
potato, to hold the pieces together. Parboil ten 
minutes, then bake either with the roast or separ- 
ately, basting with dripping from the roast. Re- 
move the toothpicks ; serve as a garnish to the 
roast. 

266. POTATOES BAKED 
First scrub thoroughly with a vegetable brush, 
tiien put into a hot oven. Potat^^s of moderate 
size require in baking about forty-Uve minutes ; 
they are at their best as soon as they are soft through- 
out. As the heat is usually strongest from above, 
turn the potatoes, occasionally, to insure even bak- 
ing. On removal from the oven, break the skin 
to let the steam escape, lest the naturally dry, 
mealy potato become " soggy " from the quickly 
condensing steam. A potato baked in a slow oven 
is less digestible than the same when properly boiled. 

207. POTATOES BAKED WITH CHEESE 

Take four latffe, cold, boiled potatoes, four eggs, 

one pint of cream, three ounces of cheese, salt and 

pepper. Cut the potatoes into thin slices and

layer with cheese, salt, and p^per, and pour over a 
little of the eggs, beaten and mixed with the cream. 
Bake about lulf an hour. Serve as a luncheon 
dish ; or at a family dinner with boiled ham, or 
broiled beefsteak. 

268. POTATO BALLS WTTH BUTTER 
With a French cutter cut out potato balls ; cook 
until tender in boiling salted water ; drain, pour 
over them a little melted butter, and sprinkle with 
finely-chopped parsley. Cook turnips or carrots in 
the same way. 

2S0. POTATO BALLS, PERSILLADE 
Boil six middle-sized potatoes in two quarts of 
water with a teaspoonful of salt for thirty minutes. 
Drain well. Press through a potato masher into a 
bowl, add half a teaspoonful of chopped parsley, 
half a teaspoonful of chopped chervil, two egg 
yolks, half an ounce of butter, half a teaspoonful of 
salt, two saltspoonf uls of pepper, and a saltspoonful 
of grated nutmeg. Briskly stir with wooden spoon 
two minutes. Boll out the pur^e on a lightly floured 
table to twelve even balls. Dip in beaten egg, 
lightly roll in breadcrumbs, place in a frying-basket, 
and fry in boiUng fat six minutes. Take up, arrange 
OQ a hot dish with a folded napkin, and serve. 

260. POTATOES A LA BELGE 
Take some rashers of streaky bacon, about five 
inches long, and half-cook them' in a frying-pan. 
Remove them to keep hot, and fry a finely chopped 
onion in the bacon fat. Place in a saucepan as many 
(peeled) potatoes as you require, with salt, pepper, 
and a large teaspoonful of mixed dried herbs. Place 
the bacon on top of the potatoes, and pour in just

shells. Season with a teaspoonfu! of salt, two salt- 
spoonfuls of white pepper, and a saltepoonful of 
grated nutmeg, adding one gill of hot milk, one 
tablespoouful of good butter. Lightly brown for 
two minutes in one teaspoonful of butter, two 
skinned and sliced pork sausages, and six very 
finely chopped shallots, and add it to the potatoes. 
Mix well with a wooden spoon for five minutes, 
then fill up the potato shells with the mixturo. 
Place on a tin ; sprinkle a tablespoonful of grated 
Parmeflan cheese over them, equally divided. Place 
in a hot oven and bake for ten minutes, or until a 
nice golden colour. Remove, place on a hot dish, 
and serve. 

892. POTATOES, BRIOCHES 
Peel eight medium, sound potatoes ; cook them in 
two quarts of water with a teaspoonful of salt for 
thirty-five minutes. Drain and press through a 
potato masher into a bowl. Season with half a 
teaspoonful of salt, two saltspoonfuls of white pepper, 
one tight teaspoonful of grated nutm^, adding two 
whole raw eggs and half an ounce of butter. Thor- 
oughly mix with the wooden spoon for five minutes. 
Spread two tablespoonfuJs of flour on a comer of the 
table. Divide the pur^e into six equal parts. Roll 
them in the flour, giving them a nice brioche form.

263. POTATOES BROILED 
Halve lengthwise cold boiled potatoes, white or 
sweet ; salt them lightly, then dip in melted butter, 
turning them so as to cover all sides with the butter ; 
then dispose them on a double-broiler^ — ^an oyster 
or tomato broiler is admirable for this purpose — and 
broil over a moderate fire, first on one side and then 
on the other, until well browned. Serve on a hot 
dish. 

264. POTATOES BROWNED 
Having boiled six or eight good-sized potatoes 
till just cooked, let them be drained and become cold. 
Cut them into thick slices of even size and shape 
(a pastry cutter will do this best), season them with 
salt and pepper, dredge them with Sour, brush the 
upper sides with beaten egg, and brown in a good 
oven on a floured tin. 



265. POTATOES BROWNED WITH CHEESE 
Boil some potatoes in their " jackets," but do not 
let them fall to pieces. Remove peel, and pare 
them till all are the same size. Have a little butter 
melted in a bowl, chip them in this, then roll them 
in grated cheese, seasoned with pepper and salt. 
Put them in a buttered tin in a good oven, and 
when the cheese has coloured, serve " hot and hot,"

one inch and haU thick. Let this get quite cold, 
then cut it into rounds with a plain two-inch cutter. 
Dip these in egg and breadcrumbs (having previously 
marked the top with a smaller cutter), and fry in 
boiling fat. When each is a golden brown, t^e o£F 
the top aa nuffked, carefully scoop out most of the 
inside (which can be used otherwise) with a tea- 
spoon handle, and replace It with mince of any sort ; 
pot the tops on again, place in the oven for a 
minute, and serve, 

867. POTATOES AND CHEESE 
Cut some cold boiled potatoes in thin slices, 
and lay them in a greased pie-dish ; over them 
lay cheese out thin, a little butter and unmade 
mustard, then more potatoes, and so on until the 
dish is full. Pour over all one pint of milk, and 
bake in a quick oven for one hour.

Mash one pound of steamed potatoee ; keep them 
hot in a Baaoepan ; Btir in one well-beaten e^ and one 
tablespoonfo] of cream ; then mix in thoroughly 
one breakfaatcnpful of flour and one teaspoonful 
of baking-powder, and leave the mixture to cool. 
Make it into email dumplings. Put the dumplings 
for fifteen minutes in (slightly salted) boiling water ; 
drain, and serve them. A sharp sauce is an excellent 
addition. 

279. POTATO DUMPLINGS, No. 2 

This is well worthy of a trial. Beat up some dry, 
floury, cooked potatoes until they are perfectly 
smooth, then mix with them one quarter of their 
weight in fine flour ; season with salt, and form into 
a moderately firm paste with an ounce or two of 
freefa butter melted in a little warm milk. Put 
the mixture into a buttered basin and steam over 
plen^ of boiling water until the dumpling is quite 
firm and light; then turn it out car^ully on to a 
hot dish, garnish it with sprigs of parsley, and send 
to table very hot, with some pleasantly flavoured 
sauce or gravy as an accompaniment. Or, if pre- 
ferred, instead of sauce or gravy, some stewed 
mnshrooniB, baked tomatoes, or fned onions, etc., 
may be served with the dumplings. If it is more 
convenient to have the dish served as a sweet 
instead of a savoury, slightly sweeten the potatoee 
and serve with sweet sauce or stewed fruit.

saucepan one ounce of salt pork ; add one sound, 
finely hashed onion and two bay leaves, and brown 
till of a nice golden colour. Then drop in the pota- 
toes, season with half a teaspoonful of salt and two 
saltspoonfuls of white pepper, and pour in sufficient 
boiling water to cover them up to three-quarters of 
their height. Cover the pan, let them slowly cook for 
forty minutes, and take out the bay-leaves. Drain 
on a hot dish, besprinkling with a little hot parsley, 
and serve.

three saltapoonfuU of white pepper, one saltspoonful 
of grated nutmeg, one ounce of butter, and half a 
gill of cream. Sharply stir with wooden Bpoon, 
while heating for four minutes ; remove, fill up six 
of the potato sheUs with preparation, arrange coTers 
on, reset in oven for ten minutes ; remove, dress on 
beated-dish, and serve. 

284. POTATOES (FRANCONIA) 

Pare the potatoes and parboil ten minutes ; 
drain and put in a pan in which meat is roast- 
ing ; baste when the meat is basted. Potatoes 
thus treated will bake in about forty-five minutes. 
Cook turnips and lai^e or ripe cucumbers, pared 
and seeds removed, in the same fashion. 

285. POTATOES FRIED. No. 1 

Peel, clean, and cut into pieces, one-half inch 
square and two and a half inches long, four good- 
sized, sound potatoes. Wash well in cold water and 
drain thoroughly. 

Have some boiling fat in a frying-pan ; plunge in 
the potatoes and fry for ten minutes, being very sure 
that the fat is thoroughly boiling before the potatoes 
are plunged in. Lift up with a skimmer, lay on a 
dish, let rest for one minute, replace in the boiling 
fat, and fry for three minutes more ; lift up with 
a skimmer, lay on a kitchen towel, and dry thor- 
oughly. Sprinkle the equivalent of a teaspoonful 
of salt over them, drees on a hot dish, and serve. 

Fried sweet potatoes are served exactly the same 
way, and both should be promptly served after 
having been prepared. 

286. POTATO PKITTERS 

Peel and grate into a bowl three medium, sound, 

taw potatoes ; add two tableepoonf uls of flour, two

raw eggs, half a teaspoonful of chopped parsley, 
half a teaspoonful of s^t, two saltspoonfuls of white 
pepper, one saltspoonful of grated nutmeg, and one 
Baltspoonful of baking-powder. Sharply mix with 
wooden Bpoon until well amalgamated. Heat two 
tableepoonfuls of melted lard in a lai^e black frying- 
pan, then drop the preparation in the pan in twelve 
equal cake forms, and slowly fry six minutes on each 
side. Bemove, drain on paper, then dress on a hot 
dish, and serve. 



287. POTATOES (FRENCH) FRIED 

Scrub and pare the potatoes, and cut in eighths, 
lengthwise ; let stand in water until all are retwly, 
then dry between towels as they are fried. Fry in a 
basket, and use but few at a time. Drain on soft 
paper and sprinkle with salt. Serve at once, as 
they retain their crispnesa but a short time. Avoid 
having the fat too hot. Often potatoes to be fried 
are soaked an hour or more in ice water ; the ques- 
tion of soaking or not soaking cut potatoes in ice 
water before frying is a matter of individual taste. 
When sliced, and left to stand in water, a large 
quantity of starch is lost, and the potato is prob- 
ably more crisp. In the other case, the pieces would 
be softer and more mealy. 



288. POTATOES FRIED WHOLE, BALLS, ETC. 

Potatoes, pared whole, may be cooked in hot fat, 
but the fat should not be too hot, as the potatoes 
must cook about half an hour. If properly cooked, 
the potatoes will be very mealy. Potatoes for 
frying are cut in many fanciful shapes. They make 
an attractive garnish for dishes of broiled meat.

314. POTATO PIE 
Slice some soond potatoes, which have been 
boiled and left to grow cold. Put a layer of these 
alices in a buttered baking-dish, and season with a 
Bprinkhng of salt, pepper, finely minced onion and 
parsley, and grated cheese. Next add a little thick 
white sauce, sufficient to hide the potatoes from 
sight ; repeat until the dish is full, when the sauce 
must be thickly covered with grated cheese. 

316. POTATO GIPSY PIE 
Cut some cold, boiled potatoes in slices about a 
quarter of an inch thick and arrange these in layers 
in a well-greased pie-dish with a little salt, pepper, 
finely minced parsley, boiled onion chopped smftll, 
and tiny bits of fr^ butter between each layer. 
When the dish is sufficiently full, and the potatoes 
on top arranged as evenly as possible, brush over 
the surface very liberally with Uquid butter or pure 
beef dripping, and bake in a moderate oven until the 
pie is bubbling hot and well browned. If preferred, 
a little finely chopped meat of some kind, pleasantly 
seasoned and moistened with good gravy or sauce, 
may be placed between the layers of potatoes, and 
the whole covered in the usual way with a crust of 
well-made, moderately rich pastry. If it happens 
that the potatoes at hand have been mashed, they 
will answer the purpose just as well, and if the pie 
is preferred without a crust, mark the surface 
neatly with the point of a smalt knife, or by draw- 
ing the prongs of a small fork across it in various

COOKED PLAINLY OR ELABORATELY 147 

ways. BrnBh over with liquid butter or dripping, 
or with beaten e^, and bake as already directed. 
Some rich, creamy brown gravy or a weU-fiavoured 
sauce is a great improvement to a gipsy pie in 
the opinion of Bome people, while othera prefer it 
without ; the point must therefore be decided 
according to individual taste and convenience. 

316. POTATOES k U. POLONAISE 
Parboil some potatoes, shoe them rather thickly, 
place them in a stewpan with a good lump of butter, 
sufficient cream to cover tfaem along with the butter

of a wooden BpooQ,preB8 the scooped potatoesthrough 
a wire sieve into a small saucepan, adding half an 
ounce of good butter, two egg yolks, half a gill of 
oream, half a teaspoonful of salt, two saltspoonfuls 
of pepper, and a saltspoonf ul of grated nutmeg. Set 
pan on range, and sharply stir with a wooden spoon 
while heating for five minutes. Remove, beat the 
whites of the eggs to a stiS froth, and gradually add 
to the potatoes, mixing well meanwhile. Dip two 
tablespoons in melted butter ; with one take up aa 
muchof the preparation as it can hold,and repeatedly 
turn the potato from one spoon to the other, so as to 
give a nice smooth roll form ; place in a lightly 
buttered tin, and proceed the same with balance 
of the potato preparation. Set in a brisk oven until 
a nice golden colour, or about eight or ten minutes ; 
remove, take up with the blade of a knife, dress on a 
dish, and serve. 

320. POTATO ROSES 

Fill a pastry forcing-bag with duchess potato 
mixture (see No. 276). Hold the bag in an up- 
right position, tube pointing downward, and force 
out the potato; at the proper moment press the 
tube gently into the mixture and raise it quickly, 
to break the flow. To make another style of rose, 
use a six-pointed tube, points almost meeting.

Hold the bag in a poeition at right angles to 
that indicated in the firat case, and force oat the 
potato in a deeply cleft cord, which is coiled round 
and round in emaller and smaller circles ; or ehape 
in bow knots. Shape the roscB on a buttered tin 
sheet, brush oyer with beaten egg, diluted with 
milk OT water, and brown in the oven. Remove 
with a spatula or broad-bladed knife, and use as a 
garnish for meat or fish. Smaller roses may be

brown, 

323. POTATO SANDERS 

Mix with cold, boiled potatoes, mashed up or 
passed through a sieve, enough flour to make a 
paste {i.e. nearly half their weight in flour). Dripping 
rubbed in — about four ounces to the pound — will 
greatly improve the paste, but will be debarred 
&om the strict v^etarian. Roll out the pMte about 
half an inch thick, and cut it in small squares. Soak 
some breadcrumbs in a very little water, just 
enough to moisten them well ; mix in with them

SWEET POTATOES 

Note. — These are the potatoee first used in 
England, known also in Elizabethan days as 
" SMrrets of Peru." Yet they are not true potatoes, 
or Solanums, at all ; but the tubers of a species 
ot codtoItuIus, IpomcBa batatis. They are very little 
used or grown in this country ; but in America they 
are a common viand, being digestible, nutrient, 
and satisfying. They are large, coarse, and thick- 
skinned ; as a rule somewhat pasty and slimy as 
compared to the flouriness of true potatoes — one 
might almost suppose they contained lard or other 
fatty matter. A liking for sweet potatoes may be 
considered an acquired taste ; but, properly cooked, 
they can be made quite alluring. They are mostly 
served as sweet dishes. 

Preparation.— Ab for ordinary potatoes. If 
plainly boiled, they should be cooked in their sktns, 
which must be removed before serving. 

360. SWEET POTATOES BAKED 
Select six good-sized, sound sweet potatoes. 
Slightly trim off both ends, wipe and place them on 
a tin plate, baking in the hot oven for forty-five

Select shapely sweet potatoes of even size ; wash 
and scrub with care. Bake and cut in halves, 
lengthwise. Remove the pulp from the akina, and 
pass it through a coarse sieve. Season with salt, 
butter, and cream. Beat until smooth, then refill 
the skins with the mixture, using pastry-bag and 
star tube. Reheat before serving. If desired, dust 
the tops with powdered sugar and cinnamon b^ore 
reheating. 

3fi2. SWEET POTATOES CANDIED 
Pare and parboil half a dozen sweet potatoes 
cut in halves lengthwise. After ten minutee* boiling, 
drain, and lay in a baking-dish. Spread thickly 
with butter, sprinkle with sugar, and, if desired, a 
little powdered cinnamon ; add a few spoonfuls of 
hot water, and bake tmtil tender, basting often with 
the sauce in the pan. Use brown sugar. 

363. SWEET POTATO-AND- ALMOND CROQUETTES 
Bake several sweet potatoes. As soon as they are 
soft, break apart, scrape out the pulp, and pass 
through a squash strainer. To each pint of pulp 
add one teaspoonful of salt, two tablespoonfula of 
butter, one beaten egg, three tablespooonfuls of 
blanched almonds, chopped and pounded in a mor- 
tar, and hot milk, or cream, to make of a consistency 
to handle. Form into the shapes of apples and pears, 
^g-and-breadcrumh, and fry in deep fat. Finish 
with stalks of parsley for stems.

pared and cut in halves, lengthwiee, to cover the 
bottom ; season with salt and pepper, and cover 
not very closely with another layer of potatoes. 
Pour on boiling water to half-cover the lower layer, 
cover the vessel tightly, and set where the heat is 
gentle. When the lower layer is browned, remove 
to the top, letting the other brown. When both 
layers ar^ tender, the water should have evaporated, 
leaving a little saace to pour over the potatoes in 
the serving-dish. If preferred, this dish may be 
cooked in a casserole in the oven. 



RADISHES 

NoTB. — ^These have been eaten and relished for 
thousands of years : bnt they do not agree with 
many people, though if freeh from your own garden 
they are quite wholeeome. 

Although usually regarded as salading, radishes 
make a good cooked vegetable ; either the leaves 
or the roots can be used. Round or turnip radishes 
are the best for this purpose. 

Preparation. — Remove the leaves, close f^ainst 
the ball of the radishes ; trim away the root ; wash 
well, bnt do not scrape or peel unless they are very 
old. 

360. RADISHES BOILED 
Prepare as above, put into fast-boiling salted 
water ; boil till tender — say about half an hour. 
Drain, dish, and serve with a white sauce. 

366. RADISH LEAVES BOILED 

Only sound young leaves should be used. Let 

them lie in cold water for at least half an hour, then 

drain and shake them, and put them into fast-boiling

Baited water. Boil till tender — say about half an 
hour. Strain off the water, chop the leaves small, 
add a little butter, pepper, and salt, reheat, and 
eerre with fried croiitons. Or treat by any of the 
methods for spinach. 

3S7. RADISHES CUBRIED 
Take some large firm radishes ; wash, and out 
them up in lai^e cubee, but do not peel them. Place 
them in a pan of hot olive oil, and let them cook for 
thirty minutes, continually stirring them or they 
will bum. When they are quite tender, add one 
teaapoonful of curry-powder and a sprinkling of salt. 
Serve immediately. 

RAMPION 

NoTB. — This native British plant, of the Cam- 
panula or Bellflow^ tribe, has fallrai into disuse as a 
market vegetable, though still privately cultivated 
by some. Abroad it is held in more favour. The 
long, fleshy, carrot-shaped white roots are edible, 
either boiled or used raw in salads. 

Various curious superstitions and fairy-tales are 
attached to this plant, such as the l^end of 
Bapuwcd (RampioD), familiar to all readers of 
Grimm or of William Morris. 

Preparation. — 'Wash and scrape the roots ; throw 
them, as you do so, into a bowl of cold water 
with two tablespoonfula of vin^ar or lemon-juice. 
Leave them five minntea, then proceed to cook 
them. 

368. RAMPION BOILED 

Prepare, as above, about a dozen roots. Have 

ready boihng, in a Ihied pan, half a pint of water, 

quarter of a pint of milk, lialf an ounce of butter,

two slices of lemon, half a teaspoonful of salt. Boil 
until tender — say about one hour and s quarter. 
Bemove, drain, and serve whole with white sauce, 
melted butter, or Sauce Hollandaise ; or thicken 
the liquor in which they were cooked. 



SALSIFY (OR OYSTER-PLANT) AND SCORZO- 
NERA (OR VIPER'S GRASS) 

Note. — These two vegetables, being so very much 
of a muchness, are usually dealt with together. 
Salsify is one of the goat's-beard species, commonly 
known as " John-go-to-bed-at-noon " from its extra- 
ordinary habit of early-closing. Both are hardy 
herbaceous plants, sals^y being biennial and scor^ 
zonera perennial, and in both cases it is the long 
fleehy tapering roots which are cooked and eaten. 
Scorzonera (also known as black salsify) is on the 
whole the better of the two ; but neither is so much 
used as was formerly the case, which seems a pity, 
as they make a nice variety as a winter vegetable. 

Preparation. — For salsify, wash and scrape a 
dozen or so of roots, place them for about five 
minutes in cold water acidulated with two table- 
spoonfuls of lemon-juice or vin^ar ; then put 
them in a lined stewpan in which you have ready 
boiling three-quarters of a pint of mixed milk imd 
water, half an ounce of butter, seasoning of salt and 
pepper, and a couple of slices of lemon. Let boil 
fast till tender, which will not be under an hour. 
Remove, drain, and serve, with a sauce separately ; 
Sauce Hollandaise, beurre fondu, and melted butter, 
are suitable. 

Scorzonera may be treated exactly the same, 
with one exception ; wash, but do not scrape it — 
instead, peel it after cooking. Take care not to let 
it grow cool in this process.

Take Balsify roote, scrape them and cut them into 
small lengths (about three inches) ; leave them in a 
bowl of cold water, with a squeeze of lemon-juice, 
till yon have a pan of fast-boiling salted water 
ready for them. I^ them boil quickly for one hour ; 
when quite tender, they most be drained and laid 
on battered toast, and a good white sauce poured 
over them. 

380. SALSIFY CROQUETTES 
Boil some salsify as above ; when it is quite tender, 
put it through a coarse sieve or colander ; add a little 
salt, pepper, butter, milk or cream, and a squeeze of 
lemon-juice. Beat thoroughly till the mixture is 
smooth and stiff ; then shape, cover with egg and 
breadcrumbs, and fry. 

3ftl. SALSIFY FRIED 
Proceed as for boiled salsify, and, when it is tender, 
drain it thoroughly and dry it in a cloth. Prepare 
a batter with one tableepoonful of butter, six table- 
spoonfuls of flour, half a teaspoonful of salt, a little 
water, and two beaten ^gs. When thia is quite 
smooth, dip in the pieces of salsify ; let them be well 
coated with the batter, and fry them in boiling fat. 
When they are a nice golden brown, remove, drain, 
and serve. 

382. SALSIFY FRIED IN BUTTER 
Scrape and trim well a bunch of good fresh salsify 
roots. Place in cold water with two tablespoonfuls 
of vinegar for five minutes. Remove, drain, cut

spoonfuls of butter ; pat the salsify in, with two 
saltapoonfuls of salt and one of white pepper ; toss 
and shuffle them for five minatee. Add the joice of 
half a lemon, and a teaspoonfnl of parsley finely 
minced. Gently toss for a minate more, and serve. 

383. SALSIFY SCALLOPED 
Proceed as for boiled salsify ; then dust a battered 
pie-dieh with fine crumbs, putting a layer at the 
bottom, and place a layer of salsify next, sprinkled 
with salt, pepper, melted butter, and minced parsley. 
Kepeat till the dish is full ; then pour in milk, 
from a pint to a quart, according to size, and bake 
in a moderate oven for an hour and a half. 



SEAKALE 

NoTB. — ^ThiB pleasant and notritioos vegetable 
reverses the general rule as regards oar apathy 
towards native growths ; for wh^^as seakale, or 
sea-colewort, a coast plant, has been eaten locally 
for some centuries, and sold in London mfirketa for 
at least two hundred years, it has never " caught on " 
over-seas. It is practically ignored in Continental 
and in Transatlantic cookery-books ; and, although 
it is easy to grow, and a hardy perennial, it is for 
some inscrutable reason considered, with us, more or 
less of a delicacy and luxury. It should be much 
more popular than it is. For those who require 
alkaline properties in food, it is rapeeially advisable. 

Preparation. — ^Wash the seakale, and make Into 
small btmdles, as with asparagus, leaving only just 
sufficient of the main stump to prevent the branches 
falling asunder. Place in boiling salted water, and 



Digitized byGoOgIC 



COOKED PLAINLY OR ELABORATELY 165 

let boil till tender — aboat twenty-five to thirty 
minutes. Serve in aoy of the ways directed for 
asparagus, and accompanied with similar sauce 
in a separate dish. Cold cooked seakale comes in 
useful for salads if no sauce has been poured over it. 
Seakale may be also treated by most of the methods 
Buggeated for cooking asparagus. 

304. SEAKALE BOILED 
Wash the seakale, and fasten it up in email neat 
bundles. Place it in boiling salted water, sufficient 
just to cover it ; let it boil till tender. Remove, 
drain, unloose the bundles, and serve upon toast, 
plain or buttered, with a good white sauce poured 
over. 

366. SEAKALE STEWED 
Wash, tie up, and parboil the seakale ; then drain 
and place it in some good gravy at boiling-point in 
a stewpan ; let it stew gently for about fifteen 
minutes. Remove, and place it on toast in a hot 
dish ; slightly thicken the gravy and pour it over. 



SKIRRETS 

Note. — Skiiiets (which are usually mentioned in 
the plural) remind one of the little girl Jemima in 
the nursery lyric commonly attributed to Longfellow. 
" When she was good, she was very, very good ; and 
when she was bad, she was horrid." That is to say, 
it all depends upon your individual personal taste 
whether yon love or hate the ekirret. It is origin- 
ally a Chineee plant, and suggests, in its flavour and 
appearance, something exotic and unknown. " This 
is that akirret which Tiberiua the Emperor com- 
manded to be conveied unto him from Gelduba, a

the same to be brought ante him everie yeare out 
of Germanie." ItB fleshy, tuberous white roota are 
slightly sweet, and went by the name of sogar-ioot 
in the Netherlands ; but the taste is decidedly 
peculiar. According to Oerarde, it may be boiled, 
stowed, baked, and made into pies, sliced or pulped. 
In Scotland, akiiret was termed crummock. It is 
rarely seen upon our present bills of fare, but might 
well be revived, if only for a change, and as a useful 
winter v^etable. 

Preparation. — (a) as for salsify ; (6) as for pars- 
nips (which see). 



360. SKIRRETS BOILED 

Take about a dozen roots of skirret, wash and 
scrape them well, and drop them into a bowl of cold 
water, acidulated with vinegar or lemoD>juice. 
Leave them there five minatee, or until you have

SORREL 

NoTB. — ^A soirel'bed was at one time mAi»- 
penBable in every well-kept garden ; bat the cul- 
tivation of thifi wholesome vegetable haa been 
neglected of recent years in Britain. In Continental 
countries it is macb and wisely esteemed. The 
best sorrel available for culinary purposes is French. 
It has a pecoliar bat fascinating acidity, from which 
some people are averse ; to modify this acidity, 
sorrel may be mixed with spinach or with lettuce, 
and a certain amount of sugar is usually added 
in cooking it. It is occasionally employed as an 
adjunct to salads ; but do not use too much of it. 

Preparation. — Sorrel should be well picked, and 
the stalks removed, as with spinach. If the leaves 
be large fmd past their first youth, shred tbem, 
tearing away the midrib. Sorrel, like spinach, needs 
to be well washed and drained. 

368. SORREL BOILED 

Prepare as above, naing plenty of water and several 
washings ; drain, shake, and put in a stewpan, 
using one ounce of batter and one teaspoonful of 
sugar to each quart of sorrel. No water is required. 
Let it cook gently till quite tender and consider- 
ably reduced, then dredge in a little flour. Stir 
well over the fire, pass through a sieve ; return to 
the pan, add another oonce of butter, and a dust of 
sugar ; beat up thoroughly, and serve. 

See also any of the methods used for Spinach ; 
but remember to Include a little sugar. 

SPINACH 
NoTB. — ^This attractive and useful plant appears 
to have been cultivated in British kitchen gardens 
ever since the eixteraith century, when it was

brought in, like so many others, by the Dateh and 
Flemings, vho had been growing it for at least 
two centoriee earlier. It is Bupposed to have come 
originally from Asia, through Spain ; a curions 
Odyssey of wanderings for bo simple and unpre- 
tentious a vegetable. 

Preparation. — As cooked in England, spinach is 
spoiled, in nine cases ont of ten, by using too much 
water, which not only washes away its mineral 
salts, hut d^nives it of individual flavour. It 

/ should be cooked in its own juices, if possible, the 
' I amount of moisture adhering to the leaves being 

I quite snfiBcient. Let it be carefnlly picked over, 
well washed, then dried by swinging the leaves to 
and fro in a piece of batter-muslin. Place the 
leaves in a double-boiler, or other vessel surrounded 
by boiling water, for twenty to twenty-five minutes. 
Remove them from the fire, chop them fairly finely, 
add a little butter, pepper, and salt, and serve in 
a hot dish. 

The following recipes mostly follow the usual 
fallacy of *' drowning the miller " in water ; but 
yon have yoor choice of the better way. 

369. SPINACH A L'ANGLAISE 
Trim away the stale leaves and stalks, clean and 
wash carefnlly in three different waters three quarts 
of fresh and sonnd spinach. Have in quite a lai^e 
^ saucepan one ^^Jl^ of boiling water with one table- 
ts spoonful of salt. When the water is thoroughly 
boiling, plunge in the spinach. Cover the pan, and 
allow to thoroughly boil for ten minutes. Lift it 
up with a skimmer. Lay on a sieve to drain well. 

Lightly brown in a saucepan one ounce of good 
butter, then add the well-drained spinach. Season 
with half a teaspoonful of salt, two saltspoonfuls of 
ffhite pej^r, adding one teaspoonful of powdered

cooking for five minutes, 

370. SPINACH BALLS 
Melt two table^poonfuls of birtter ; add two 
tabl^poonfulB of flour and half a teaapoonful of 
sugar. When blended, add a tableepoonful of 
cream and three-quarters of a cup of cooked spinach, 
chopped fine. Beat well, remove from the fire, and 
add two eggs, one at a time. Season with salt and 
pepper, to taste, and a few grains of mace. Butter 
a tablespoon and fill with the spinach mixture, 
making it level with the edge of the spoon, find 
pooch in a saucepan of boiling water four or five 
minutes or until firm. The water must not boil 
hard, but simply simmer very gently at one side. 
Six or more bollB may be cooked at one time. Let 
drain in a colander while making a cream sauce ; 
reheat the balls in the sauce, and serve. A tea- 
spoonful of the sauce with three or four capers in 
may be placed on the top of each ball, and the rest 
of the sauce poured around the balls. 

371. SPINACH A LA BECHAMEL 
Drain the spinach and chop fine, or para through a

Lift them out carefully into another bowl of water, 
and wash as before ; if you do it a third time, bo 
muoh the better, but be sure to remove the spinach 
from the water ; don't drain the water off the 
spinach, or you will get all the sand and grit bach 
which you have just washed off. Place the spinach 
in a pan with a little salt ; by careful watching, 
yoa can boil it in its own moisture — this is much 
the best ; but, otherwise, only put just enough 
boiling salted water to cover it. After about twenty 
minutes' boiling, drain oS the water, and chop the 
spinach very small in a heated bowl. Heat a 
tablespoonful of batter in a stewpan, put in the 
spinach, add salt and pepper to taste ; let it get 
well heated, and serve on buttered toEist in a hot

minutes. Drain well on a sieve and completely 
squeeze the water out, then hash up very finely. 
Have one ounce of melted butter in a saucepan with 
two tablespoonfuls of fiour ; stir well with a wooden 
spoon while heating for one minute ; then poor in 
three-quarters of a gill of cold cream and same 
quantity of cold milk. Season with a teaspoonful

TOMATOES 

NoTB. — ^The tomato, re^y a fruit, is here for con- 
venience' sake classed along with v^etables. It is a 
member of the remarkable Solavacece order already 
discussed, and is a near kinsman of the potato, egg- 
plant, and capsicum. It was introduced into Eng- 
land from Southern Europe, during the Elizabethan 
period, and termed the Apple of Love, or sometimes 
Pomumaureum ; originally, however, it was a native 
of South America, and its name is derived from the 
Mexican iomaU. For at least three centuries the 
tomato has been gradoally widening in popularity, 
until at last, from s lon^y podtioD of select aristo- 
cratic expensiveDCes, it has become one of the com- 
monest and (frequently) cheapest of fmit^ vegetables, 
an everyday constituent of the costermonger'a 
collection. Of course there are tomatoes and 
tomatoes. The English-grown onee are incom- 
parably the best ; but for cooking, as distinguished 
from salad purposes, the foreign ones, if sound, will 
suffice. Avoid, however, unripe and green ones ; 
and on no account bay pulpy over-ripe ones. If 
you cannot obtain the happy medium, it is better to 
do without them. 

Preparation.— YaxieB according to the nature of 
the dish, but in every case the tomatoes should 
be gently wiped with a soft towel, the stalks and 
flower-tops removed ; and, if it be desirable to 
skin them, plunge them for a minute into very 
hot water ; they can then be easily skinned witit 
a sharp knife.

TRUFFLES 

Note. — ^These are subterranean fungi, which grow 
in curious clusters under the soil of woods, and are 
never seen upon the surface. They are only discover- 
able by their smell ; and only specially trained 
animals (dogs and pigs) have sufficient sense of smell 
to find them. There are various kinds, black, red, 
white, and grey. The tmfSe is so nitrogenous that 
it may almost be considered as animal food ; but it 
is a luxury, of course, and an expensive one. I 
bave often wondered whether trnffle-bunters and 
truffle-eaters get as much fun for their money as 
do country children grubbing after pig-nuts, ^ose 
pleasing tubers of the umbeUiferous woodland 
plant Cenopodium, which one discovers and devours 
with such relish in the golden years before one's 
" 'teens." Truffles grow wild in Britain ; chiefly 
under beeches and oaks. 

Preparation. — ^Wash and scrub the trufflee well 
with a hard brush ; they must be perfectly clean 
and free from soil or grit. Then soak them for a 
couple of hours in warm water.

405. TRUFFLES IN CROUSTADES 

Take aome large truffles which have been soaked 
as above directed, peel and slice them thinly, and 
put them in a frying-pan with one or two ounces 
of fresh butter, according to quantity of truffles 
(five or six should eufflce). Add salt, pepper, and 
cayenne or paprika ; and half a glass of sherry. 
Let them simmer quietly for thirty minutes, then 
moisten them with demi-glace or good gravy. 
Take a French roll and halve it lengthways, re- 
move the cramb, fry the cruets a light gold colour 
in butter. Then drain and fill them with the 
trufflee ; serve on a hot dish.

TURNIPS 

Note. — ^Turnips, like parBoips, carrots, beetroot, 
and other vegetables which figured continually in 
Roman minus, were unknown in England till the 
Bizt«enth century. Their human food-value is 
nothing like that of the above-named roots, eepeciatly 
parBnipa, when cooked. A large percentage of water 
iB included in the turnip, and if it is old enough to 
be tough and stringy, it is extra Indigestible. The 
ordinary garden turnip has the more delicate flavour, 
but the orange-yellow swede turnip (chiefly used for 
fodder) is much more satisfying. 

Owing to the cheapness and ease with which 
turnips may be grown, even in poor and sandy soil, 
they have proved somewhat of a snare to slothful 
people. It is not bo long ago since a tour through 
the agricultural districts of Suffolk revealed the 
astounding fact that the labourers' wives fed their 
children, day in day out, on boiled turnips. Not 
to save money, so much as to save trouble. 

Preparation. — ^Turnips should be cooked and eaten 
when young. Having washed them and trimmed 
away imy fibrous matter, place them, uncut, in 
boiling salted water, and cook till tender — about 
twenty-five minutes. Serve whole, with melted 
butter or white sauce. 

Older turnips will of course take longer to become 
tender. They should then be drained, mashed, 
and seasoned with pepper and salt. Place them in 
a stewpan, add a little milk or butter, stirring the 
mixture over the fire for about five minutes. Serve 
very hot. 

Kohl-rahi (which is a turnip-like vegetable) 
may be treated as above.

407. TURNIPS BOILED 
Take eome Bound white turnips ; peel, halve, and 
boil them in salted water. Drain and maeh them ; 
add at least one tablespoonful of butter, the same 
of cream, and a little pepper. Arrange in a mound 
in a heated dish, and serre at once. 



408. TURNIP BALLS (POULETTE SAUCE) 
With a potato cutter cut out a pint of balls 
from large white turnips ; put over the fire in cold 
water, acidulated with one or two teaspoonfuls 
of lemon-juice or vin^ar, and let cook for five 
minutes after boiling begins ; then drain, rinse in 
cold water, and cook until tender in chicken broth. 
Skim out the turnip balls and thicken the broth with 
one tablespoonful and a half each of butter and 
flour, creamed together — there should be about 
one cup and haU of broth ; let simmer ten minutes, 
then add the beaten yolks of two eggs, diluted with 
half a cup of cream. Season to taste with salt and 
white pepper ; add the balls, and let stand over hot 
water until very hot. A tablespoonful of lemon- 
juice improves (his dish for some. If a French 
cutter be not at hand, cut the turnips in cubes of 
uniform size, or cut out cylinders with an apple- 
oorer, then out these into half-an-inch lei^ha, 

409. TURNIP CHARLOTTE 
Cook Blicee of carrot and turnips a quarter of an 
inch thick until tender ; drain and use them to line 
a buttered charlotte mould. Boil white turnips

mould, standing in a pan of water, until the centre 
becomes firm. Tom from the mould, and serve 
with yeloutS, white, or bechamel sauce. 

410. TURNIPS CHIPPED 
Boil turnips till almost cooked, then slice them 
thinly and fry them in butter. This makes a nice 
change, but is perhaps lees digestible than plainly 
mashed turnips, served hot, with a little butter and 
pepper mixed in. 

411. TURNIPS IN CREAM 
Peel and slice the turnips ; blanch and cook until 
nearly tender in salted water. Drain and cut into 
cubes a quarter of an inch thick. Simmer ten or 
fifteen minutes in sweet cream. Season with salt, 
sugar, and white pepper ; add one or two tablespoon- 
fuls of butter, and shake the pan until the butter is 
blended with the other ingredients. Serve in a hot 
dish. 

412. TURNIP CROQUETTES 
T^e some cold mashed turnips, and mix them 
with a quarter of their quantity of fine breadcrumbEi, 
pepper and salt to taste, and one to two beaten eg^ 
according to the amount of turnip. Blend well, 
shape into croquettes, dip in egg and breadcrumbs,

414. TURNIP PRlTTElftS 
Peel and boil some lai^e tomips, having eliced 
them crossways. When they are nearly boiled, 
add a little salt. Brain the slices, dredge t^em with 
flour, and fry in a little butter. Dust them with a 
little granulated sugar, and let them become a nice 
brown on both sides ; then strew with salt and 
pepper, and serve. Use as little butter as possible. 

«6. TURNIPS GLAZED 
Take some young turnips ; ^ash, thinly peel or 
scrape, and shape them like large olives. Put them 
into fast-boiling salted water for about eight minutes ; 
when they are parboiled, drain them, and dry them 
in a cloth. Put them in ashallow stewpan or frying- 
pan In which at least one ounce of butter has been 
melted, and dust them thickly with castor sugar. 
When they begin to brown over the Are, add a very 
little stock, salt and pepper to taste, and another 
sprinkling of sugar. Let them stew slowly till 
thoroughly tender. Place in a hot dish, and pour 
the ligaid over them.

One pound and a half of turnips boiled till three- 
parts done ; then cut into very tliln slices and 
arrange in a buttered baking-dish (as in Potabjea 
d la Marichah) in layers, the slices overlapping 
each other, each layer sprinkled with grated 
cheese and a little butter previously melted ; a 
little seasoning of spiced pepper should alfiO be 
added. Finish on top with grated cheese and 
butter, and bake half an hour. 

419. TURNIP PIE 
Boil and mash sufficient turnips to make one 
breakfastcupful ; add two beaten eggs, one pint of 
milk, quarter of a nutmeg grated, four tablespoon- 
fuls of grfUDulated sugar. When all is well mixed, 
put it into a low pie-disb lined with short crust, and 
bake a nice brown.

one tableepooiiful of flour ; stir till smooth ; when 
frothy and boiling, add one pint of milk ; season, 
and Btir till the sauce is thickened. Poor over the 
turnips, and serve. 

421. TURNIPS STEWED 
Tf^e two pounds of young turnips; wash and 
peel and shape them as equally and evenly as pos- 
fflble ; place in cold salted water till it boils. Drain 
and diy the turnips. Melt four tablespoonfuls of 
butter in a stewpan ; add the turnips, with s little 
salt and a good squeeze of lemon-juice. Put a little 
more batter over the turnips ; let them stew slowly 
till quite tender. Sprinkle with two tea«poonfnls of 
finely minced parsley, and pour into a lu>t dish. 

422. TURNIP-TOPS, No. 1 

These should be quite young : when old and 
stringy they are also coarse and bitter. They are 
very wholesome if used fresh and young. Pick and 
wash them well, and cook them like spinach — i.e. 
either in their own moisture or with the smallest 
possible quantity of salted water. They should be 
done in about fifteen minutes. 

423. TURNIP-TOPS, No. 2 

Boil the turnip-tops in plenty of salted water for 
at least one hour; drahi them thoroughly, cut 
them small with a knife, mix a little butter with 
them, and serve very hot, 

424. SWEDES BOILED 
Take some large swedes ; peel and cook in fast- 
boiling water till quite tender. Drain, mash, add 
butter, salt, and pepper, serve hot. Many people 
prefer swedes to tomips ; they have a stronger, 
coarser fiavour, but are very nice for a change.

VEGETABLE MARROWS 

Note. — ^Ve^table marrows are fmits, if one is 
to be particularly accurate ; but we usually class 
tbem amongst v^etables. Where is one to be^n 
to differentiate i They are absolutely unromantio 
objects. The lovely mellow colouring of gourd and 
squash has been denied to them : the alender elegance 
of cucumber is not theirs : they have neither the 
decorative outside nor the luacious inside of the 
melon. Of all the Cueurbitacece, they are the least 
attractive, and, so to speak, the poor relations of 
the family ; and yet they are homely, useful things : 
good in particular for " stu£Sng," for frying, and 
for preserving. Their food-v^ue is a ne^igible 
quantity — they consist, I believe, of 90 per cent, 
of water. But if gathered and eaten quite young, 
with a decent sauce, they are delectable, if only 
as a variety. 

Preparation. — If the vegetable marrowB are 
gathered really young and small, before the seeds 
are formed, they can be cooked and served whole, 
with beurre fondu or Sauce Hollandaise ; they can 
also be stewed in a closed earthenware jar in the 
oven, with plenty of butter and a little salt and 
pepper. When they are larger, they require to be 
peeled, halved, and the seeds removed ; they can 
then be either cooked as they are, or stuffed with 
a filling. When they get very large, then, if I were 
you, I should not use them at all except for jam. 



*26. VEGETABLE MARROW BOILED

boiled) into slices, and place them on a buttered 
pie-dish, which has been rubbed with garlic ; 
Bprinkle the slices, first with oheeee, then with 
breadcrumbs ; and, lastly, place a little butter 
over them. Bake for one hour in a hot oven. 



427. VEGETABLE MARROW FRIED 
Take a medium-sized vegetable marrow ; peel it 
and boil in salted water till tender ; drain it, dry 
it, and cut in even slices, removing the seeds. Dip 
in beaten egg and breadcrumbs ; fry in boiling fat. 
Season with salt and pepper before serving. If a 
small marrow be used, cut it in quarters and pro- 
ceed as above. 

428. VEGETABLE MARROW AU GRATIN 
Take some very small marrows, slice them in 
rounds about a quarter of an inch thick, and lay 
them in a pie-dish. Pour tomato sauce over till 
they are hidden, then cover with breadcrumbs and 
grated cheese, and sprinkle little bits of butter over. 
B^e in a good oven until you find the marrow 
tender on trying it with a fork. 

429. VEGETABLE MARROW MOCK WHITEBAIT 
Parboil a medium-sized vegetable marrow, out it 
up into slices about the size of whitebait, and roll 
these on a floured cloth ; get them as dry as possible. 
Have ready a pan of boiling oil, deep enough to 
cover the slices completely ; fry them a golden 
brown. Drain them, pile them on a paper serviette, 
and serve them with siloed lemon (or s^ad dressing) 
and bread-and-butter

Cut up a large marrow into email pieces ; Bkin it, 
and take away the seeds ; fry the piecee with an 
onion cut in rings and a small do7e of garlic. When 
slightly browned, put in a saucepan with enough 
stock to cover it, some button mushrooms, salt, 
and pepper. Let it simmer for an hour, thicken 
with flour, and serve. 



431. VEGETABLE MARROW STUFFED 
Cut off a thick slice from the top of a young 
marrow, and scoop out the seeds ; stuff the inside 
with any forcemeat most convenient (sausages free 
from skm will do, or merely breadcrumbs and herbs). 
Kub a saucepan with a blade of garlic, and, when 
you have put on the top which was cut off the 
mcuTow, lay it carefully in the saucepan (it should 
only just fit), pour upon it half a pint of stock, and 
add herbs, pepper, salt, and a little bit of onion or 
a clove of garUc ; lastly, a tabiespoonful of vinegar. 
Cover the saucepan closely, and let the marrow 
simmer slowly for two hours. Dish up carefully, 
and pour the sauce through a strainer over the 
marrow. 



432. VEGETABLE MARROW TART 
Take a small marrow, stew it quite tender, mash 
it up with butter and sugar to taste ; add a little 
flavouring of lemon-peel, spice, and ginger, and beat 
an e^-yolk well in. Make taxtlets of puff-paste in 
patty-pans, or line a dish with puff-paste and, when 
the pastry is baked and has gone cool, fill it with 
above mixture, and put it back for a minute in the 
oven. The whipped white of e^ can be laid on 
top if liked.

GOURDS AND PUMPKINS OR SQUASHES 
NOTB. — As theee familiar fmlts of the earth are 
all much of a muchness with vegetable marrows, 
I lump them together with the latter. Goorda 
are glorious to look upon, but oothiug like so 
gloriouB to eat. Pomph^, or squashes — the terms 
seem interchangeable — are really best when made 
into sweet dishes ; but both they and gourds 
can be cooked in any way recommended for vege- 
table marrow. There is not very much flavour to 
the square inch in any of them, but the smaUer 
and younger they are, the better they will be, A 
celebrity has said, that if every boy contLoaed to 
develop as fast after six years old as he did before, 
he would be a coruscating genioB at tweo^. In- 
stead of which . . . But this goes to show that if 
you take your gourd or pumpkin young, it is wmth 
having. Afterwards its coruscating genius ia buried 
beneath mountains of too, too solid flesh. 

Preparation. — ^As for vegetable marrows. If very 
small, cook whole; if not, peel, remove seed and 
pulp, cut up into rings, cubes, or stripe of desired 
size. 

433. FUMPKDT BAKED 
Cut up a smallish pumpkin into cubes an inch long, 
and dry them ; dredge them with floor, and pat a 
layer of them in a buttered pie-dish ; add seasoning 
of salt and pepper, a little mmced parsley and finely 
chopped ctuves, and sprinkle with good salad oiL

cover with tomato eance, strew grated cheese over 
pretty thickly, theo scatter breadcrumbs, with small 
bits of butter, on top. Bake in a moderate ovea till 
the pumpkin is tender, which you can ascertain by a 
fork or skewer. 

43S. PUMPKIN BOILED 

Take a young pumpkin, and boil it in b<»ling 

salted water about half an hour or longer ; drain 

and serve with a little butter in the dish, or with 

melted butter in a tureen. 

436. PUMPKIN MASHED 
Boil a young pumpkin, cut it open, and take out 
the seeds ; mash the pulp with a little butter,

437. PUMPKIN PUDDING 

Proceed as above ; place the mashed and seasoned 

pumpkin into a buttered basin, and bake in the 

oven with a cover over for half an hour ; turn out 

and serve with melted butter. 

438. PUMPKIN OB SQUASH STUFFED 
Take a half-grown squash, and simmer whole in 
water ten minutes. Cut them in halves, if small ; 
in quarters, if large. Scrape out the interior, leaving 
the shells, however, thick enough to handle without 
breaking up. Remove seeds, if large. Press all 
superfluous moisture out of the vegetable pulp, and 
add to it the following : to enough squash to serve 
six persons put one cup of dry breadcrumbs, one 
onion, and one tomato minced fine, one-fourth a clove 
of garlic, thyme, parsley, bay-leaf, two cups of shelled 
shnmps chopped fine, and two teaspoonfuls of lard. 
Fry the onion and shrimps lightly in the lord, and add

to it the tomato and herbB. Into this turn the 
squash, which has been thoroughly mixed with the 
crumbs, also salt and pepper and a beaten egg. Turn 
over and over with a spoon, mixing it again and 
again. Let the whole cook for about ten minutes. 
Have the shells arranged in the baking-dish, fill 
each, rounding nicely. Sprinkle with dry bread- 
crumbs, mixed with melted butter, and bake until 
brown. Serve hot. 

The squash may be heaped upon a pie-plate, and 
so baked without the shells. Crab, minced ham, 
veal — almost anything in fact which ia savoury — 
may take the place of the shrimps. Egg-plant is 
stufied in the same way, but ne^ a little longer 
boiling than squash. 

WATERCRESS 

NoTE.^ — This cheap and wholesome vegetable is 
usually served uncooked, alone or as a constituent of 
salads. But it can also be made into a palatable 
dish, and afiords a welcome variety. 

Preparation. — ^Wash it well in several waters, see 
that any decayed leaves are removed, and that the 
leaves are perfectly free from insects ; be careful that 
it is eil watercress, and that no poisonous brook- 
lime is mingled with it. 

439. WATERCRESS BOILED 
Having well washed the cress, and thoroughly 
picked it, chop it, not too small. Have ready in a 
lined pan one tableepoonful of butter and two 
ounces of floor, weU mixed and lightly browned ; 
add half a pint of thin stock, and let it boil up, 
stirring carefully ; add salt and pepper to taste, a 
little nutmeg, and a squeeze of lemon-juice ; then 
add the chopped watercress. Boil, and serve with 
fried crofttons.

YAMS 

NoTB. — ^These are obtainable in England, but few 
people are acquainted with their excellence as a dish. 
Th^ are tubers of different shapes, sizes, and 
colours, in shape mid-way between Jerusalem 
artichokes and sweet potatoes. They come from 
China and Japan, from India, Guinea, the West 
Indies, and other hot countries. Each locality 
respectively considera its own yam the beet ; bat 
the wlute floury one is that most likely to commend 
itself to the English cook. They make an intereetlng 
variety in the v^etahle m^nu, and may be cooked 
in almost any way which is appUcable to potatoes. 

Preparation. — ^As for potatoes and sweet potatoes 
(which see).

CEREALS USED AS VEGETABLES 

NoTB. — This includes various preparations of 
wheat floor, such as macaroni and vermicelli ; 
maize or Indian-corn, and its preparations, such as 
hominy, semolina, etc. ; rice, that invaluable sub- 
stitute, to millions of people, for bread and potatoes ; 
barley, and other grains which, while not v^etables 
in the culinary sense, can be employed as such 
for the purposes of ordinary meale. I have not 
mentioned those cereals, such as oatmeal, etc., whioh 
are mainly used for breakfast dishes. 



This extremely nourishing and palatable cereal 
is chiefly used in its prepared form known as pearl 
barley. In employing it as an addition to soup, 
broth, stews, etc., it is best when steeped first, 
according to the following directions, which will 
help to draw out its mucilaginous qualities, and to 
ensure its proper expansion. 

Preparation. — Place four tablespoonfuls of pearl 
barley in a quart jug, and pour in one pint of boiling 
water. Leave it at the side of the stove to steep 
for at least two hours, then boil it till it thickens 
slightly, and add it to hot milk ; or add it to soup, 
and let it boil up.

MACARONI 

Note. — ^Macaroni is made from wheat flour, and 
is remarkably nutritive. All the various kinds of 
macaroni require the same cooking, but some need a 
longer time than others. The stick macaroni should 
be broken into short piecesof even lengths and cooked 
in rapidly boiling salted water till tender, then 
drained and rinsed in cold water to separate the 
pieces ; then returned to the fire, along with the 
liquid in which it will be served, in a double-boiler, 
and cooked till most of the liquid is absorbed,

Whether green, ripe, or tinned, it makes a usefnl and

There is a picturesque and stately air about maize 
in growth. Readers of Hiatoatha will remember 
the maize incarnate, in the shape of the young man 
Mondamin with his tassels, his plumage, his green and 
yellow garments. Even as its grains are much larger 
and of a different formation to those of other cereals, 
so, when cooked green, its taste is of a jdeaeant 
aweetnesB, quite unlike any other flavour one can 
recall. 

iVeporofton. — Strip off the husk to the inner 
layer, and remove the " silk " ; then replace the inner 
layer, and tie it at the top end. In some cases,

RICE 

NoTH, — ^When oombined with egg8, cheeae, milk, 
or moftt juices, rios is an excellent food. The grey 
unpolished rice stocked by seed and grain shops is a 
more nutritious article than the husked and polished 
rice which grocers sell. 

Preparation. — ^There are several ways of cooking 
rice, each of which has points of merit. As a rule, 
rice-growing people prefer the rice-grain lees tender 
than do those of northern climes, just as the Italians 
prefer macaroni in a state which by many would be 
called an underdone condition. But soft or not, 
all wish rice dry. The quantity of liquid that the 
grain will absorb depends upon the variety of the 
rice, the season in which it was grown, the time it 
has been kept, and the liquid used. Theee things 
affect, also, the time of cooking. Rice will absorb 
in cooking from two uid a half to four timee its bulk 
of liquid. When three cups of water would suffice, 
three and a half or four cups of milk or tomato pur^ 
are required. 

Rice needs to be thoroughly cleaned before cook- 
ing. It may be washed in several waters, being 
rubbed, meanwhile, between the hands, but the most 
satisfactory way is to bluich it. Put the rice over 
a hot fire in a large saucepan of cold water, and 
stir, occasionally, while it is heating ; let boil five 
minutes, then drain on a sieve and pass cold water 
from the tap through it. The rice is now beau- 
tifully white and clean, and the grains do not adhere 
to each other, *To cook, return to the fire, covered 
with the hot liquid, whatever thU be, in which it 
is to be cooked ; let cook rapidly, until nearly all the 
liquid is absorbed, then finish cooking over hot 
water. If the liquid be milk, cook from the first, 
after blanching, in the double-boiler.

4SI. RICE BOILED, No. I 
Wash the rice thoroughly ; cook, in four times 
as much water, directly over the fire. Use a 
tightly covered saucepan, that the moisture or steam 
may be absorbed by the rice. Have the fire less 
brisk at the last part of the cooking than at first.

Cover (he blanched rice with a relatively large 
quantity of salted boiling water, and let cook

to dry. Serve in a hot dish.

rice, pepper, salt, and a large piece of dripping ; 
mix and stir well on the fire, and serve very hot. 

Hijte. — ^ThiB is a very favourite dinner with the 
peasants of Madeira. It is a very good accompani- 
ment to cold meat, and is very economical, as the 
remams of either cold cabbage or cold rice can be 
used. It is best to cut the cabbage quite small 
before adding the rice. Cabbage should be boiled 
in two waters ; it is much more digestible.

CHAPTER IV 

SWEET FRUITS AND NUTS USED AS 
VEGETABLES 

NoTB. — By good righte, cucumbers, gourds, meloiu, 
pumpkins or squaBbes, tomatoes, and egg-plants 
should be included in this section. But it seems to 
me that this would be disconcerting to the ordinary 
housewife, and therefore I place apples, bananas, 
chestnuts, and olives by themselves, because one 
naturally thinks of them as a separate issue. 

The use of sweet fruits as an accompaniment to 
salt dishes is very old ; that of nuts as a substitute 
for meat is comparatively modem. Apple sauce 
with roast pork or goose is a time-honoured institu- 
tion ; so is cranberry sauce with turkey ; so ja red 
currant jelly with mutton or bare. It is probable 
that our forefathers largely extended this list, and 
mixed up sweet and salt in a way which would cer- 
tainly stagger their descendants. One has only tb 
read the m^nus of their dinners, to be convinced 
of their amazing latitude in this respect. But I 
think we tend to the other extreme, and might 
very well replenish our ideas and our tables with 
dishes such as those suggested below. 

APPLES 

NoTB. — Good sound cooking apples should be 

selected for culinary purposes; English ones have 

a flavour which no foreign onea possess, and I do not 



Digitized byGoOgIC 



SWEET FRUITS AND NUTS 223 

recommend American, Canadian, Tasmanian, or New 
Zealand apples for any of the uses indicated below. 

002. APPLES BAKED 
Select medium-sized cooking apples, as even as 
possible in eize ; wipe and bake them in a pie-disb, 
just covered with water, till they are tender, but not 
broken. Serve with boiled beef, as though they 
were onions. This ia a favourite Spanish method. 

603. APPLES FRIED 
Peel and core some good-sized sound apples ; cut 
each in four equal shoes, dip in milk, lightly roll in 
flour, fry in boiling fat for five minutes ; drain and 
serve. These are excellent with broiled steaks, 
sausages, or fried eggs. Two tableepoonfuls of lard 
will suffice to fry three apples, cooking them at 
least two minutes on each side. 

80*. APPLES SCALLOPED 
Peel and core some cooking apples ; cut each in 
eight equal slices. Cover the bottom of a buttered 
pie-dish with them. Strew over them one table- 
spoonful of fine crumbs, a little salt, a dust of 
cinnamon, a teaspoonful of brown sugar. Repeat 
until the dish is full ; finally let the top be crumbs. 
Cover it with another pie-dish of same size, bake 
thirty minutes in hot oven, then bake a quarter 
of an hour longer, uncovered. Serve hot with ducks, 
pork, or goose. 

BANANAS 

NoTB. — Only green bananas, or those by no means 
ripe, should be employed for these dishes. The 
ripe banana is much too sweet, as well as too soft ; 
and of the over-ripe banana it may be said that it

224 MAY BYRON'S VEGETABLE BOOK 

courts Ul-health and internal afflictiouB. Cooked 
bananas are exceedingly nutrient and (to most 
people) digestible, and as a change will be always 
welcome. 

006. BANANAS BOILED 
Green bananas are best for this purpose. Take 
six good-sized ones, peel and slice them lengthways 
or across, lay them in a stewpan with one cupful of 
milk and seasoning of salt and pepper, and let them 
simmer slowly, but without stopping, for about half 
an hour. Heat half an ounce of butter in a 
ahallow poo, add two teospoonfuls of flour, brown 
slightly ; stir in the liquor from the bananas, let all 
come to the boil, then pour it over the bananaa laid 
in a hot dish. 

506. BANANAS CURRIED 
Place half a cupful of grated coconut and half 
a pint of milk in a bowl, and leave it covered ap for 
an hour. Put two tablespoonfuls of butter into a 
stewpan and beat up ; fry one tableepoooful of 
curry-powder in it ; add to this six green bananas, 
peeled and cut in sUcea ; season with salt and 
cayenne ; add one teaspoonful of Worcester sauce, 
and strain in to the rest the milk from the coconut. 
Simmer gently for fifteen minutes ; beat up an egg 
and stir in ; let all thicken, and serve on a hot diih 
inside a border of rice like other curries. 

607. BANANAS FRIED 
Peel and cut two sound bananas into quarter-of- 
an-inch square cubes. Make a tablespoonful of 
butter thoroughly hot in a frying-pan, and fry the 
bananas briskly for three minutes, tossing them 
light. These are a good accompaniment to scrambled

SWEET FRUITS AND NUTS 225 

t^fi, boiled Bpinach, eto. Seasoa with aolt and 
pepper. 

Bananas may also be fried cut in lengthwise 
strips. 

CHKSTNUTS 

NoTS. — It is a pity that the food-value of chest- 
nuts is not more generally recognised. They are, 
as Evelyn said, " exceedingly nutritive, a robust 
food." The roasted chestnuts of the London streets 
are the only common form in which this excellent 
product is encountered ; but in Southern Europe 
they are appreciated at their real worth, and v^e- 
tArian depots have helped to popularise both 
chestnuts and chestnut flour. They make a most 
appetising dish, plain boiled, with white sauce, as 
sn accompaniment to baked meat ; but with a 
little extra trouble all manner of wholesome, 
savoury, and satisfying cODcoctions may be made. 

Preparation. — ^For boiling, slightly nick or slit each 
outer skin or shell so as to enable its easy removal 
after cooking. For roasting, leave them as they are. 
For stewing, remove the outer shell, and place the 
chestnuts in boiling water, as you would almonds, 
till the inner skin is removable. For sweetened 
dishes, the cbestnuts must be boiled, shelled, 
skinned, and rubbed through a sieve, or chestnut 
meal can be used to save time. 

S08. CHESTNUTS BOII^D, No. 1 
An excellMit variety in " second vegetables ' ' can 
be made by putting one pound of chestnuts into 
■alted boiling water, letting them cook fast until 
tender, then peeling and serving, masked in white 
sauce. A slight incision should be made in each 
chestnut hoak before cooking.

B09. CHESTNtlTS BOILED, No. i 
Cut one poDDd of cheetoate half-way down each 
Bide from the thin end ; put them into a saucepan 
of boiling salted water, and boil them fast for 
twenty minatea ; drain them as you would pota- 
toes, and serve in their skins. At table they are 
eaten with butter and salt. 

510. CHESTNUTS AND BRUSSELS SPROUTS 
Boil some chestnnts in water for two hours; 
remove the peel. Boil some sprouts for half an 
hour, strain them well, be careful not to break 
them. Have ready a frying-pan with hot beef 
dripping or butter ; put in both chestnuts and 
sprouto and keep moving until the fat is absorbed 
(do not brown), then serve. 

611. CHESTNUT CAKES (FRIED) 
Take one pound of chestnuts and cut a small 
piece out of each. Place them in fast-boiling salted 
water for thirty minutes ; drain, peel, and rub 
them through a sieve ; add one beaten ^g, two 
tableepoonfuls of milk, two ounces of butter, one 
teaepoonful of Worcester sauce, and seasoning of 
Bait and pepper. Mix well and roll out ; cut into 
small round cakes, which must be dipped in egg and 
breadcrumbs and fried in boiling lard or dripping. 
Drain and serve hot.

COMBINATIONS OF VEC^ETABLES 

Note. — ^These economical and wholesome diehes are 
but little used in Britain, compared to their popn- 
larity in other countries. The chief point about 
them iB that they shall be cooked to a nicety, every 
vegetable ingredient being exactly right, neither 
underdone nor pulpy. This, of course, means 
particularly careful cookery. The Beasoning and 
flavouring of these preparations is also of the utmost 
importance, as is their appearance when dished. 
If they are allowed to become an indistinguishable 
parti-coloured mass, a " fortuitous concourse of 
atoms," they will not present an appetising aspect ; 
but, well prepared, they will be acclaimed with 
much admiration. 

B21. CABBILOW 
Mash boiled potatoes and boiled cabbages to- 
gether, mixing with them slices of onions, and 
sprinkling the mess with pepper and salt, to which 
should be added a little butter or dripping. The 
dish is improved by being put into a Dutch oven 
to be browned, like mashed potatoes. 

B22. COLCANNON

sliced oaioD in one ounce of butter, and adding 
half a pint of stock, four quartered tomatoes, one 
ounce of flour. Mix well, boil all together ; strain 
through, a sieve; add pepper and salt to your 
liking, and a dash of lemon-juice ; then put the 
macaroni on top of the sprouts, and cover all with 
the sauce. Care must be taken to keep the sprouts 
and macoroni hot, separately, while the sauce is 
being mrde.

CHAPTER VI 

VEGETABLE CREAMS AND PUREES 

NoTB. — As Soups do not come within tho eoope ol 
this book (being separately considered in the Soup 
Book), I include here some v^etable creams and 
pnr^, which are singularly nutritious and appe- 
tising. Purees should not be serred aa soups, bat 
as vegetables, so to speak, in a liquefied form. Their 
thickness is not derived from flour or rouz, but from 
the actual vegetable ingredient which has been 
employed, delicately cooked and passed through a 
sieve. For convalescents, children, old people, and 
persons of weak digestion, no better way of treating 
v^etables can be found. 

Creams and bisques more nearly approximate to 
the conventional soup ; they are ctdefiy prepared 
by adding a v^etable pulp (or meat or fish pulp) 
to a thin white sauce. As the pulp will otherwise 
settle to the bottom of the dish instead of blend- 
ing evenly with the liquid, a thickening of corn- 
flour, arrowroot, or tapioca is usually added, also 
yolks of ^gs. 

All these preparations necessitate much care and 
trouble ; but the purSes are the moat easily mads 
and probably the most satisfying, for which reascm I 
have relegated the majority of creams and bisques 
to the Soup Book. 

fi4S. AIITICH0KE3. CREAM OF 

Peel and wash well in cold water twenty-four

thirty minutes. 

Have in a saucepan one ounce of melted butter 
and two ounces of flour. Stir well while heating 
for one minute. Strain the artichokes, etc., through 
a gravy strainer into this saucepan and briskly 
whisk for two minutes ; as soon as it comes to a

CHAPTER Vn 

HERBS AND SALADINGS 

NoTB. — ^This chapter iucludea those pot-herbs which 
are nsed in connection with salt food at the present 
., day : a small list indeed compared with thoee of 
our fathers ; and the same may be said of their 
Balad-stuSs, which were infinitely more varied and 
numerous than ours. John Evelyn reduced a long 
list of possible " salletings " to thirty-five ; but 
Abercrombie, writing about a century ago, men- 
tions forty-four. Wild flowers were included — 
whether as pure decoration or not it is hard to say 
— also very many young green shoots and sprouts, 
and no doubt a number of plants of exotic origin 
might now be added to the list. 

I have only included such herbs as are used for 
salt dishes. Bay-leaf ia used for both sweet and salt. 

Salad vegetable^ already mentioned — beets, 
celery, cucumbers, endives, cresses, lettuces, 
radishes, tomatoes, etc., will be found in Chapter II 
under their respective headings. 

664. BOUQUET OF HERBS 
The faggot, or bouquet, so frequently used for 
flavouring, should consist of a bay-leaf, a sprig of 
thyme or sweet marjoram, and two or three cloves 
wrapped and tied inside two or three small sprigs of 
parsley ; a piece of lemon-rind is sometimes added. 
Seeds, such as celery, peppercorns, etc., should be 
tied in a bit of muslin.

Another method, more elaborate, is termed 
bovquet garni : for this you first put a layer of parsley 
on the table ; then the bay-leaf and thyme, next, 
one or two spring onions, a strip of lemon-peel, and 
a very small blade of mace. Two cloves and a small 
stalk of celery may be added. The parsley is wrapped 
well round all these, and tied at both ends. Bay- 
leaf counts aa a flavouring herb. The idea is, to be 
able to remove the herbs entire from the hot liquid 
which they have flavoured, 

S65. ALEXANDERS 
This is a very ancient pot-herb, sometimee known 
as wild horse-parsley, and having a decided resem- 
blance to celery both in appearance and flavour. 
It grows wild, and is a common plant in early spring, 
specially near the sea — in fact, its whole associa- 
tions are those of sea and spring, and the " blowing 
of the western wind Pavonius in Februarie" (see 
Pliny on alexanders). It can be used like celery, 
the upper part of the roots and the young tops 
(blanched or not) being eatable either as salad or 
cooked. 

60fl. ANISE 
Apart from medicinal usages, the seeds of this 
are chiefly employed for flavouring soups. It 
needs discretion in the amount used, bdng fairly 
strong for onr modem tastes, and having a highly 
individual flavour, 

5S7. BASIL 
Of this celebrated herb there are two varieties, 
sweet and bush basil. It is of great antiquity, and 
■ has always been surrounded with the most extra- 
ordinary superstitions : as, that it mnst be sown 
with cursing and railing ; that it breeds scorpions ;

262 KAY BYRON'S VEGETABLE BOOK 

thU it will not grow along with me, etc., etc. Be 
•U this as it may, basil is a most osefnl flaToaring 
herb for flonps and salads, and no connoisseur in 
cookery can afford to be without it. By the French 
it is considered indispensable. It imparts a some- 
what clove-like taste, and can be used either fresh 
or dry. 

868. BCRNUrr 

This is a salad-herb, which must be eaten yonng 

or not at all. It has a pleasant smell, and tastes 

rather like cucnmber. It is a native plant, and was 

formerly to be foond in every garden. 

8*9. CHERVIL 
This is a most valuable addition to salads, and 
(as a Savouring herb) to other salt dishes. It must 
not be confused with the vegetable chervil (see p. 
73). It is really a desideratum to the artistic and 
conscientious cook, because nothing can exactly re- 
I^ace it. 

670. CRESS 
This is the cheapest, commonest, and most popular 
of green-atufis, except, perhaps, watercress. Its 
peculiarity is that one cannot think of cress without 
mnstard : these two are practically inseparable. 
It, or they, can be stewed or boiled, but popular 
costom is all in favour of eating them uncooked — 
and very excellent they are. Be sure, however, that 
your cress is fresh — stale "salleting" is not only 
nasty, it collects bacilli with extreme assiduity. 

871. CHICORY, OR ENDIVE

found the wild fennd moch inferiM*, if at all, to

HORSE-RADISH 

Note. — One hardly knows under what heading 
to class this favourite condiment. Usually regarded 
as an indispensable companion to the roast beef of 
Old England, it certainly cannot be considered of 
dietetic value, tboi^ its medieval worth, especially 
as an anti-scorbutic, is nnqueationable. It is 
probably more digestible grated than scraped ; and 
good borae-radish sauce, properly made, is a unique 
and deliciooB preparation. 

Preparation. — Choose a young and tender root in 
preference to an old one ; scrub it thoroughly, re- 
move all the ends, etc. Either scrape it into minute 
ebavings, using a sharp knife, or grate it ; the latter

is preferable where eaace is concemed. If the 
process be carried on in a strong draught, your eyes 
will be less affected. 

B74. HORSE-RADISH SAUCE, COLD 
To a small teacupfnl of grated horse-radiEh, add 
the same amount of cream, and mix well ; then stir 
in a small teaspoonful of salt, half a teaepoonful of 
pepper, a teaspoonful of powdered sugar ; last of 
all, one tablespoonful of vinegar, which must be 
mixed in very gradually, so as not to curdle the 
cream. If you want the sauce still hotter, add a 
flat teaspoonful of mustard. 

67i. HORSE-RADISH SAUCE, HOT 
Put a teacupful of grated horse-radish into a 
tumblerful of good stock, and simmer gently till 
heated throughout ; then add two beaten yoiks 
and one dessertspoonful of tarragon vinegar. Season 
with pepper and salt ; stir well till thick and hot, 
and serve. 



676. HYSSOP 
Not much used nowadays in England, bat for- 
merly in request for Savouring broths and soups, 
and for sprinkling into salads. It Is strongly 
aromatic, and has had a great reputation in its 
time. 

677. LAMB'S-LETTUCE OR CORN-SALAD 
A wild plant, frequently cultivated In gardens 
since Elizabethan days ; extremely popular in 
France as a salad herb, but never a great favourite 
over here, though, indeed, it is, in Gerard's phrase, 
none of the worst.

678. MARIGOLD 

This cheerful, pleasant flower was once a sine 
qud non in broth and soap, " the Herb GenersU in 
all pottage." The yellow petals, whether freshly 
gathered or dried, or pickled, are useful for flavour- 
ing broth or for adding to salads; they are not 
like anything else in taste or look, and are distinctly 
wholesome. 

679. MARJORAM 

A wild herb, grown largely as a garden pot-herb, 
and in former days as an adjunct to salads. Mar- 
joram is chiefly employed for flavouring soups and 
forcemeats, but its older uses might well be re- 
vived. It is peculiarly pretty when growing wild, 
— its soft purple-red blossoms being striking in their 
coloor and profusion. 

680. MINT 

This invaloable herb is one of the best in all re- 
spects. Not only is it appUcable (as a mere deli- 
cate aoupfon) to salads, not only is it the sworn 
companion of green peas and new potatoes, but 
its very smell is refreshing and invigorating. The 
name mint Is said to be derived from the Greek 
mevihe, the mind, because of its cheering effect upon 
the spirits. 

Mint should be either absolutely dry — i.e. pow- 
dered — or absolutely fresh. Stale and flabby mint 
is worthless. Take plenty of mint leaves, wash 
them and gently squeeze out the moisture ; chop 
them very small ; put them into a bowl or sauce- 
boat, and pour over them about two tablespoonfula 
of boiling water ; iidd two tablespoonfuls of sugar. 
Cover up closely and leave in a cool place for about 
half an hour ; then add a pinch of salt, a dash of 
pepper, and either four tablespoonfuls of vinegar 



Digitized byGoOgIC 



266 MAT BYRON'S VEGETABLE BOOK 

or the juice of a lemou. If yoa intend to use the 
latter, one tablespoonful of sugar will suffice. 

Mint-sauce, as only too commonly made, is a 
repellent vinegarish Uqnid, containing nothing bat 
a few coarsely chopped pieces of mint. It is a« 
different as chalk from cheese compared with the 
properly-made article, which should be thick with 
finely minced mint. 

C81. MUSTARD 
The mustard which is inseparable from crees is 
not the same plant as that from which the condi- 
ment is made. It is a small salad herb which we 
have cultivated for many centoriee, and even if 
one does not a^ree with the enthnsiaatio Evelyn 
that it is " of incomparable effect to quicken and 
revive the spirite," still, it is always welcome, as 
an addition to the salad-bowl or eaten plain with 
bread and butter — of course, plus cress. In prepar- 
mg mustard and cress for the table, be careful to 
remove, so far as possible, the split seeds which in 
many cases still adhere to the stalks. 

682. PARSLEY 
Perhaps the most celebrated, in point of anti* 
quity, among all pot^herbfr — the source of innum- 
erable curious sayings and superstitions — parsley, 
from time immemorial has been in continual usaga 
and appreciation. The roots, the leaves, and th« 
seeds were cooked in olden days, or the fresh green 
sprays were valued as garnishing, or the chopped 
leaves were put into hot dishes aa well as salads, 
or the seeds were strewn into various concoctions, 
from soup to cheese. Parsley was alternately re- 
garded as an evil omen of death and disaster which 
could throw a whole army into panic, or aa the 
verdant mysterious garden-bed whence babiet wer*

brought into the hoasehold. According to popular 
traditions, panley maet be bowh only on Good 
Friday, ii you want it to grow at all ; it has 
been said to go to the devil and back nine times 
before it comes up. As for it« present culinary 
worth, I need hardly discuss that; but let me 
entreat you to use it as fresh as possible, to chop 
it (if to be chopped) as fine as possible, and to re- 
member that a httle garnishing of it lends attrac- 
tiveness to the plainest dish — it is so very clean 
and green and pretty. 

883. PURSLANE 
A thick, fleehy plant, which can be eaten either 
uncooked with salad dressing, or as a cold, cooked 
vegetable for salad porposes. It was formerly also 
pickled, like samphire. It is, I believe, coming into 
use a^aia with many households, 

884, SAQB 
Many are the virtaee attributed to sage by folks 
of bygone days ; its very botanical name. Salvia, 
is derived from the idea of saving and healing. " He 
that would live for aye," says the adage, " must eat 
e^e in May." Ite high repute extends so far back 
into the ages, tliat its present comparative discon- 
tinu&nce is the more strange. Sage and onions still 
hold their own, chopped sage is included in certain 
stuffings ; but we are not prone to include " the 
tender sunmiitfl of the young leaves," or the flowers 
of sage, in our salads, as in former centuries. 

888. SAMPHIBE 
An excellent wild plant, succulent, fleshy, aro- 
matic, known only to dwellers by the eea. Sam- 
phire (a corruption of £r«r&e de SaiiU Pierre) grows 
on rooky cliffs, and is not always easy to come at.

" Half-way down," wrote Sh^eepeare of Dover 
cliff, " hangs one that gathers samphire — dangerous 
trade." llbe one that gathered samphire, wanted 
it for ]uckling and for salads — to both which pw- 
poseci it is pre-eminently fitted. By popular repate 
it grows jast oat of reach of the wavee, bat jiut 
within reach of the spray, which endows it witii a 
nniqae salty flavour, in addition to its natural 
spicy aroma. For centuriee it was considered '* the 
pleasanteet sauce," and is still largely employed for 
pickling by those acquainted with ite virtaes. 

686. SAVORY 
There are two species of savory, (" Bommer " and 
" winter "), commonly used as pot-herbs ; both are 
very asefut. They are not unlike marjoram in 
appearance and flavour, and are sometimes con- 
fused with it. Common savory, in other lands, is 
used much as we use parsley, finely minced and 
strewn over other v^etables, or put into pottage, 
etc. Winter savory, formerly used in dried and 
powdered form as a relish, although more in de- 
mand than the former kind, might be much more 
largely used with advantage. It is a grateful and 
pleasant herb. 

087. SORREL 
Practically indispensable on the Continent, but 
much neglected here of recent years. Sorrel is a 
salad-herb of exceeding individuality. It gives a 
touch of sour which is peculiarly fascinating ; it 
imparts " so grateful a quickness to the salad that 
it should never be left out." Both garden sorrel 
and French sorrel are employed ; it is a matter of 
taste which yon prefer. Do not pat too much in 
the salad, that's all — a little goes a long way.

688. TARRAGON 
Thia aromatic and peculiarly individual herb is 
very precdone to the expert cook, both for use like 
parsley, chopped and strewn, or as tarragon vine- 
gar. Its " somewhat austere " taste, as described 
by the old herbalist, renders it a most desirable 
addition to salads, as to certain saucee and dress- 
ings. I should class tarragon as an indispensable. 
It is especially useful, in vinegar form, for mixing 
" French " mustard. 

B89. THYME 
This fragrant and aneient herb is full of gentle 
poetic associations, such as hardly any other cuUnary 
plant possesses. " Eveigreen, sweet-scented, fine- 
flavoured," thyme abounds in honey, and has just 
sufficient aromatic pungency to lend character to 
its delightful sweetness. There are many species, 
but for kitchen purposes lemon-thyme and common 
garden thyme are the best. Whether fresh or in 
a dried powdered state, it is invaluable. A little 
taste of thyme, especially lemon-thyme, is good in 
salads. 



SMALL OKIONISH SALADINGS

Cbivee are always spoken of in the plural ; I 
do not think anybody ever said "a chive." This 
Is beoaase they are so very minute, more like 
tubular grass than anything else. They are Alliums, 
or onions, of the LiUacen order, and you might 
easily mistake their little leaves for those of some 
small liliaceous plant. It is the leaves only which 
ore used, and these for Savouring purposes alone, 
finely chopped. They are excellent for salads.

691. OABLIO 
This is the Btrongeet, rankeat, and most pm^nt 
of all the onion tribe ; it is specially popular, for 
some ineorutabte reason, in hot countries, but in 
our temperate climate it shonld only be used with 
great discretion. Merely to rub a dish or salad- 
bowl with a clove of garlic is usually sufficient for 
culinary purposee. " The little more, and how 
much it ie 1 " Throughout this book I have but 
seldom mentioned garlic, because, if overdone, it is 
too terrible to any cultivated taste. Still, it is a 
valuable thing, and has been r^arded aa such from 
time immemorial. 

602. ROCAMBOLE 
A native of Denmark, and a member of the 
onion or Allium family, '* the gentler Rocambole " 
has fallen more or lees into disuse. It is not so 
strong as garlic, and not so mild as onion. The 
bulbs, used young and green, are delicate and 
savoury, and can be aatiefactorily employed in 
all placee where garlic is indicated. Few persons 
in this kingdom enjoy the rank pungency of the 
latter. 

693. SHALLOTS 
These may be described as the smallest and 
daintiest bulbs of the onion family. They are 
used for flavouring and pickling, but never, so far 
as I know, as an individual dish. They are most 
useful little bulbs where a very mild onionish sug- 
gestion is desired. The name is sometimes spelt 
" eschalot," a corruption of the botanical surname 
aacalonicum, indicating its origin from Ascalon in 
Palestine. We are not to suppose that the Lady 
of Shalott was associated with anything so prosaic 
as even this meekest of onions.

CHAPTER Vm 

SALADS 

NoTH. — ^The word aalad means, literally, something 
salted. It has oome to be applied especially to a 
combination of vegetables, herbs, nuts, etc., either 
cooked or uncooked, but generally the latter, served 
cold, and with a sauce or dressing containing cream 
or oil, acid, and salt. You can have a salad of 
one vegetable only — a simple mixture of few in- 
gredients is preferable for many reasons ; but 
salad, in its widest term, may comprehend a great 
many odds and ends besides its vegetable basis, its 
contents extending to eggs, cheese, fish, and even 
meat and game, not to mention various fruits. 
It may here be noted that the term " fruit salad " 
is literally a contradiction in terms, since this latter 
dish is sweet, not salt. It is a melange of different 
fruits, carefully arranged ; but not, strictly speak- 
ing, a salad at all. 

Salads are of immemorial antiquity ; here in 
England they have been popular, at any rate, since 
Shakespeare's days, and their main constituents, 
in all probability, have remained very much the 
same. I presume that the original salad consisted 
of uncooked vegetables and herbs, and that the 
addition of cooked items is a comparatively modem 
innovation. The oldest salad-plant, in all probar- 
bility, is lettuce ; the next oldest, radish. After 
those, the favourites are cress, beet, celery, cacum- 
bera, cabbage (shredded), dandelion, endive, mua-

SALADS 263 

tard, onion, sorrel, tomato, and watercress. And 
when you have named these, you are only at the 
beginning, for in addition to all the salad-plants 
mentioned in Chapter VII. — which are or have been 
in common use in other countries, bat have mostly 
been forgotten here — almost every cooked v^etable 
— potatoes first and foremost — can be succeesfuUy 
incorporated into a salad ; aU manner of herbs can 
be employed for its seaBOUing. Almonds, hazel- 
nuts, pea-nnts, walnuts, etc., are an ^icellent 
addition ; hard-boiled eg^ are invaluable ; cream 
cheese, English and foreign — Stilton, Cheddar, 
Oruydre, Neufoh&tel, may be requisitioned ; so 
may apples, bananas, melons, oranges, pineapples, 
currants, cherries, etc., etc. Shredded scraps of 
fish, flesh, uid fowl — tinned fish and potted viands 
— can all be included, on occasion, in this delectable 
compound which you mix and call a salad. 

" But it needs heaven-sent moments for this 
skill." A salad ill-mixed, or carelessly arranged, 
or prepared with stale and flabby materials, is much 
worse than none at all. It ought to be (a) pleasant 
to the eye — ^prettily and decoratively placed, not 
dumped into a bowl eUI anyhow. It ought to be 
(b) nicely regulated in flavour and texture — pleasant 
to the mouth. And it ought to be (c) of distinct 
food-value — and so planned that it is so. 

For instance, lettuce and watercress, by them- 
selves, are very wholesome, but not very nourish- 
ing. Directly, however, you add a definite article 
of food— such as potato, or cheese, or egg, or nuts, 
even in very small quantities — ^you have distinctly 
heightened the dietetic value of the salad, and that 
is an important thing to do. 

Also it must be remembered that the oil or cream 
contained in the salad-dressing la a notable essen- 
tial to health, and although for people of weak 
digeetion the vinegar which must companion the

oil IB inadviBable, it may alwayti adTantageoosly 
be replaced by lemon-juice. A large namber of 
Balad dresBlngB will be fonud in Chapter IX. 
but, as stated there, the secret of sQCcesa in aalad- 
dressing is slow and gradual amalgamation of all 
the ingredients, especially the acid — ^vine^ar or 
lemon-juice — which always muet be added last. 

PREPARATION OF A BALAD 

The green v^etable ingredients of a salad should 
be as fresh as possible : crisp tenderness is their 
first requisite. They should be gathered either in 
the early morning or after sunset, and kept in a 
cool place — not soaking in water, as is too fre- 
quently the case, but in a tan or earthenware vessel 
closely covered to exclude all air. 

Do not start cooking them till shortly before they 
are required, then cleanse them with great care. Cut 
off the root, remove discoloured leaves, and wash 
thoroughly, examining each leaf, for slugs and centi- 
pedes are unwelcome in a salad; then place them 
in very cold water, acidulated with a little lemon- 
juice and vinegar. Leave them about half an hour ; 
remove, drain, and dry — not by squeezing, but by 
swinging them to and fro in a piece of butter- 
muslin or a wire basket. You can, if need be, 
further gently wipe them between folds of butter- 
muslin or cheese-cloth, then let them stand open 
to the air for a minute. If they are wet, the dress- 
ing will not adhere to them properly. It is better 
to use a silver-plated knife than a steel one ; but a 
clean, sharp steel one may be employed for cos 
lettuce, the leaves of which should be piled one on 
another, and then cut through into ribbons of equal 
size. The outer leaves of cabbage lettuce may be 
treated similarly, but the inner leaves should not 
be cut at all, merely separated each from each.

SALADS 266 

New potstoeB, beeta, and other fairly firm root 
TegetAbloa should be cat into rings, rounds, cubes, 
or stars ; this can be done beet with tin paste cutters. 
All the ingredients should be as neat and sym- 
methcal as possible — not ragged or haphazard in 
appearance — and as clean, cold, and crisp in texture 
%s you can get them. 

They should not be put together until the last 
moment before you are ready to dress them. 

It is possible to arrange a salad in decorative form, 
and to serve the dressing — especially if it be mayon- 
naise or bought " salad cream " — separately. This is 
usually considered rank treason and heresy against 
the orthodox rulee of salad-making, but in some 
cases it is advisable, especially for people who 
strongly dielike oil, in obvious evidence. 

So far as is possible, I have avoided including 
any salads which contain meat, poultry, game, fish, 
or tinned stuff. These are all regarded as legitimate 
ingredients of a combination salad ; but they seem 
rather out of place in a V^etable Book. 

The question of onions demands a paragraph to 
itself. Some people consider a salad tasteless with- 
out onion in some form — whether garlic, Spanish 
onion, shallots, chives, or those delicious but potent 
small spring onions, of which it may be said that 
they ate "little — but, oh my I " Other people, 
again, simply loathe to encounter any of these 
savoury vegetables. How are you going to please 
both? Well, a few drops of onion juice (see No. 705) 
may be incorporated with the salad ; or a crust of 
bread may be Savoured with garUc, onion, or shallot, 
and rubbed round the bowl inside (this is a very 
usual proceeding) ; or a slice of onion, or a clove of 
garUo, may be rubbed well round the bowl. The 
middle way, as usual, is the safest.

This is a most essential matter ; it makes all the 
differeoce between a mere nibbiah-beap of un- 
considered trifles, and an ordered, organised, sym- 
metrical, and beautiful dish. Nature never makes 
anything carelessly or haphazard ; if you examine 
into the smallest daisy, you will find evidence of 
the most exquisite shaping, balance, and Bynunetry 
of its component parts. At the base of nullions of 
flower-petals, where they are joined on to the corolla, 
you would discover the most intricate and lovely 
ornamentation of design and colour. No ^e can 
see it, without unpicking the flower ; but there it is, 
all the same. A similar inconceivably perfect decora- 
tion exists in shells, in bird's feathers, in all sorts of 
microscopic objects ; the idea of rhythmic propor- 
tion, finish, and beauty pervades the whole. 

So that there is no waste of time or energy really 
involved, in humbly following the footsteps of 
Nature, If the Creator took all this meticulous care 
with the (apparently) most trivial of His works, we 
should not count it labour lost even to arrange a 
salad well. 

One maysecure an almost infinite charm of variety 
in doing this. There are various points to consider : 
(1) the general form of the salad, (2) the way in 
which it is to be served, (3) and the manner in which 
it is to be garnished. The first should more or less 
dictate the second, A large combination salad 
including cooked and uncooked v^etables is more 
suitably placed in a big salad bowl, and there gar- 
nished to taste. A small and dainty salad of few 
ingredients can be served in nests of lettuce leaves, 
in baskets of halved orange-peel, in scooped-out shells 
of red apple, or cups fashioned from beetroot. 
Tomato "cases" may be used; small half-melon

rinds : in fact " there is nothing," as has been well 
said, " which cannot be artistically blended with 
something else, in the fruit and vegetable world." 

Then oa r^ards gamishes. Very often the main 
constituents of a salad, especially when it mostly 
consists of cold cooked vegetables, do not readily 
lend themselves to use as actual garnishes. It is 
true that you may cutyour beet, radishcfl, cucumbers, 
apples, bananas, and other firm ingredients into a 
variety of pretty fanciful forms ; you may combine 
them with all manner of additions in the way of 
nuts, cheese, hard-boiled egg, etc. For instance, 
you can arrange rings of Spanish onion with a centre 
of tomato in each ; hard-boiled egge may be cut in 
strips, with yolk centres, d la marguirite, or shaped 
into petals, like water-lilies ; or supplied, when the 
white is sliced in rings, with centres of beetroot or 
tomato. Little stars of cream cheese can be placed 
upon discs of beetroot. Tomato jelly or cucum- 
ber moulds may be used as bases for other items. 
Shredded white of egg and shredded beetroot can 
be arranged in a multiplicity of ways ; and all 
these colour-efEects of whites, reds, and yellows can 
form kaleidoscopic combinations with the delicate,

CHAPTEK IX 

SAUCES, SALAD DRESSINGS, ETC. 

NoTB. — ^As the Savce Book of this series will be 
devoted wholly to its subject, I include here only 
such Bauces and dressings as are to be used witii 
v^etable or vegetarian dishes. A sauce may be 
the making or the marring of a concoction, and 
yet it is the rarest thing in the world to find a really 
well-made sauce in the average English household. 
A French epigram declares that " one may become 
a good cook or roaster — one must be bom a sauce- 
miJier." It is not only a matter of skill and ex- 
perience — though these are infinitely necessary. It 
requires s fine taste, a sense of daintiness and 
deUcacy, and the mot juete in flavouring. Sauce 
demands, in short, that you should treat it " as if 
you loved it." The crude unappetising prepara- 
tions too often dignified by the names of sauces and 
salad-dressings are literally not worth thedr salt. 
Whereas "a perfect sauce," it has been said, "ia 
a promoter of digestion and an aid to nutrition ; 
where a contrary efiEect is produced, something is 
wrong with the sauce," 

A sauce will render the commonest v^etable 
more palatable, by presenting it imder a new aspect, 
and with a difieient added flavouring. Tezturs, 
also, so important a point in gastronomic matters, is 
to be considered here ; it is because the sauce is 
of so different a texture and consistency to the

SAUCES, SALAD DRESSINGS, ETC. 289 

T^etable, that it is doubly welcome. I venture to 
think that very few honsehold cooks recognise the 
extreme help and value of sauces. 

All simple sauces are, or should be, produced 
from roux, white, yellow, or brown, mixed with salt 
and pepper, and diluted with liquid — cream, milk, 
water, or stock. 

Boux, which imparts substance to a sauce, is 
made witb equal weights of floor and butter (or 
with twice the weight of butter to the flour) cooked 
tt^ther. Place the butter, say one ounce, in 
a small, smooth, clean pan ; when it has melted till 
it bubbles, add half an ounce of flour, with a quarter 
of a teaspoonful each of salt and white pepper. 
Stir this well in, and continue to stir until the mix- 
tare turns yellowish — three to five minutes. (If 
you want a brown sauce, go on stirring until the 
mixture turns a reddish brown.) Now move the 
pan to a cooler part of the range, gradually add a 
cupful of cold milk or white stock, stirring constantly. 
When all the liquid has been added, let the sauce 
boil up ^ain fast, then let it simmer five minutes 
in a cooler place. If you are not ready to use it, 
stand it in hot water, covered over so that it 
shall not form a film on top. If, after standing 
thus, you find the butter separated from the sauce, 
with an oily appearance, add one tablespoonful of 
cold liquid and stir over the fire until it boils again. 

This is the foundation of aU thickened saucee. 

For mayonnaise and other salad dressings, re- 
member that a teaspoonful of lemon-juice or vine- 
gar, added to the yolks of eggs before the oil is put 
in, will lessen any liahihty to cnrdle. If, however, 
the mixture should curdle, break a yolk of egg into 
another bowl, add to this, very gradually, the 
curdled dressing, and then continue to add Uie oil, 
drop by drop ; this will set things right. In making

made as below, and yon add a mixture of finely 
chopped herba and vegetables in equal quantities 
of each : viz., chervil, tarragon, chivee, and capers, 
with the pounded yolk of a hard-boiled egg. Ab 
many people have no means of obtaining the above 
herbs, etc., I should suggest, as alternatives, parsley, 
Bhallotfl or small onions, pickled nasturtium seeds, 
and thyme. 

694. SOUH CREAM SALAD DRESSING 
Take three hard-boiled yolks, and rub them smooth 
in four tableepoonfuls of thidi: sour cream, which 
must be added very gradually. Add one small tea- 
spoonful of castor sugar, the same of mustard, a 
dash of pepper, a little salt, and sufBcient Imnon- 
jnice to thin the mixture to taste. Mix well. 

«eA. VINAIGRETTE (FRENCH SALAD DRESSING), 
No. 1 

One teaspoonful of mixed mustard, one teaspooD- 
fal of salt, half a teaspoonful of castor sugar, about 
quarter of a teaspoonful of black pepper, and 
(gradually added) one tablespoonful of vinegar, and 
f^o tablespoonfuls of salad oil. Stir and mix 
thoroughly. 

Cream can always be substituted for salad-oil, 
and in all cases where vinegar is mentioned, 
lemon-juice casi be advantageously used instead. 
It is not cheaper, but it is far wholeeomer. 

flW. VINAIGRETTE, No. 2 
Two tablespoonfuls of salad oil, one tablespoonful 
of vinegar, half a teaspoonful of made mustud, two 
^gs, salt and pepper. Boil the eggs hard, sieve or

which is the secret of a suocessfal salad dressing. 

e97. SAUCE MAYONNAISE, No. I 
Take one yolk, one eggspoonfal of made mafltard, 
half a saltepoonfol each of salt and pepper ; mix 
well with a wooden spoon ; add over half a break- 
fastcup of salad oU, drop by drop, till the mixture 
is of a thick batter-like texture ; add very gradu- 
ally a full teaspoonful of white vinegar, or tarrag<Hi 
vinegar, and blend thoroughly. 

SM. SAUCE MAYONNAISE, No. 2 
Place in a small bowl one fresh ^g-yolk, one 
tablespoonful of good vin^ar, two Baltspoonfuls of 
salt, one saltspoonful each of muetard and of 
cayenne. Whiek the whole sharply for two minutee 
with a wire whisk, then add, drop by drop, nearly 
half a breakfastcup of good olive oil, continually 
mixing, and still mixing for three or four minutes 
after the oil is all in ; add the juice of a quarter 
of a lemon, and mix again. 

«M. SAUCE MAYONNAISE, No. 1 
Mix half a teaspoonful of salt with a few grains

all is well mixed and slightly thickened; add one 
teaspoonful of lemon-juice or tarragon vin^ar, and 
blend well with the other ingredients ; then add 
one pint of olive oil, drop by drop, heating con- 
stancy. When the mixture becomes too thick to 
beat well, add some vin^ar or lemon-juice — you 
can use two tablespoonfuls of each (four in all).

700. MAYONNAISE SAUCE, No. 4 

Two yolks of eggs, half a pint of salad oil (or 
oream if preferred), a pinch of pepper, half a tea- 
spoonful of salt, one dessertspoonful of malt vin^ar, 
one dessertspoonful of tarragon vin^ar. The oil 
or cream should be added, drop by drop, to the 
yolks, and the vinegar added very ^wiually at the 
end, taking great care that the sauce does not 
curdle. 

701. MAYONNAISE SAUCE, No. 6 

Two raw ^gs broken into a bowl ; add one 
tableepoonful of butter, half a teaspoonful of 
mostaxd ; three tablespoonfuls of vinegar added 
last. Stand the bowl in fast-boiling water, and 
stir until the sauoe is as thick as cream ; then add 
half a teaspoonful each of salt and pepper, and 
pour the mixture over sliced cold potatoes, shced 
tomatoes, or whatever you wish to drees. 

70a. SAUCE MAYONNAISE, COOKED 
Add to six whisked yolks two teaspoonfuls of 
made mustard, one saltspoonful of salt, and a pinch 
of cayenne, stirring continuously. Place in an 
enamelled saucepan, then add a quarter of a pint of 
salad oil, whxBking all the time ; next, a quarter of 
a pint of cream, and one tableepoonful each of 
vinegar and Worceater sauce ; add all these very 
gradually, and lastly add a quarter of a pint of 
vin^;ar in the same way. Continue to stir gently 
all the time you are mixing, or the sauoe will curdle. 
Place the pan over hot water or a slow fire, whisk 
till the mixture thlekens (but it must not boil).

703. BLANC 
This is a stock used tor cooking white vege- 
tables in ; it not only flavours them, but pre- 
serves their colour. One pound of finely minced 
beef suet is placed in a stewpan, with one table- 
spoonful of flour and three and a half pinta of cold 
water. When this boils, add half a pound of finely 
chopped onion, one lemon-rind, one toblespoonfnl 
of powdered thyme, a few sprigs of parsley, one 
teaspoonful each of sugar and of salt. Let boil for 
thirty minutes over a sharp fire, then strain and 
use. A slice or so of lemon helps to retain the 
colour of white vegetables cooked in blanc. 

704. DEMI-GLACE 

Note. — ^Demi-glace, or half-glaze, is very important 
to the more elaborate cooking of vegetables. It must 
be made in a large quantity at a time, as the recipe 
will show, and in summer must be boiled up again 
every week. In winter it will keep for three or four 
weeks in good condition. When the supply is nearly 
exhausted, more must be made. It should be 
diluted with a little hot broth before using ; this 
only refers to what is actually taken out of the jar. 

Put ten quarts of cold water into a large saucepan ; 
place it on the stove. Take two freeh calves' feet, 
cut them small, and put them into a small baking- 
pan, with half a pound of raw ham, cut up ; one 
pound of veal bonee, two sliced carrots, two sliced 
onions, two sliced leeks, three large sprigs of parsley, 
one head of celery (sliced) ; add ten cloves, four

(fre^ or tinned). Boil slowly for half an boor ; then 
move pan to side of range and let it ammer very 
gently. Any little odds and ends of meat or veget- 
ableB can go into the pan. Let it stay whero it is 
until tbe demi-glace it reduced to half the original 
quantity. 

7M. ONION JUICE 
This Ib most valaable as a flavouring, and eaves 
time in cooking. Peel an onion, cut a thin slice off 
one end, then rub it with a rotary motion against 
a grater, and the juice will begin to run. Rub the 
grater against the onion till all the juice is extracted. 
Another method is to keep a lemon-squeezer speci- 
ally reserved for onions.
