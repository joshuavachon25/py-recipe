This is a digital copy of a book that was preserved for generations on library shelves before it was carefully scanned by Google as part of a project 

to make the world's books discoverable online. 

It has survived long enough for the copyright to expire and the book to enter the public domain. A public domain book is one that was never subject 

to copyright or whose legal copyright term has expired. Whether a book is in the public domain may vary country to country. Public domain books 

are our gateways to the past, representing a wealth of history, culture and knowledge that's often difficult to discover. 

Marks, notations and other maiginalia present in the original volume will appear in this file - a reminder of this book's long journey from the 

publisher to a library and finally to you.

In presenting this system of Cc 
begi leave to state, that the 
bat camposed upon a plan 
■Iphkbetical, at once the sim 
never hitherto been adopted by wri 
■tta and sciences this mode am 
applied; and Dictionaries of e 
convenient and popular com i 

works that teach the arts of civilizi 
require to be easy of referen ■ ; 
fftpn cnmpel a cook to turn to a 
the svstiiu- hitherto existing is so confosedj that, wlien this is the 
m^. niiicii time must be lost in searching for them. The difficulty 
of (inJiiiq-, with sufficient dispatch, the various receipts which are 
ufteu required, has long been complained of; and it is t))crcfore 
angular th^it the plan of the present Work, apparently so obvious, 
and certainly so well calculated to save time and abridge labour, 
diould not have been sooner adopted. 

With regard to the conlents of this volume, apart from its plan, 
the Edittir begs to State, that he has enriched his Dictionary of 
^ Cookery .md Confectionery with numerous excellent receipts, most of 
hich h^ve Heldom or never appeared in print before; and these have a 
ir prrfixL-'l to note them. The number of asterisks throughout the

IV ADVERTISEMENT. 

Confectionery, so much neglected in other Cookery Books, much 
attention has been paid ; and, upon the whole, the Editor ventures 
to hope that he will be allowed to have given to the public a valuable 
Work. 

Among other novelties will be found an alphabetical list of 
the various kinds of Fish, Flesh, Fowl, Fruits, and Vegetables, with 
the months when each is in season, and original instructions for 
choosing the several kinds of Food. 

The Editor has only further to observe, that, so far is he from 
arrogating too much to himself of the credit which may be thought 
due to the work, that he is free to confess himself largely indebted to 
the talents and labours of numerous friends in the profession, to 
whom he takes this opportunity of returning his grateful acknow- 
ledgments.

BAKINti.— Ihe following useful ob> 
serv.ition'*, written by Mr. Turner, 
Kn>:lif4h nnd French Bread and Biscuit 
Hnker. nt the in><t:mce of the author of 
the Cook'* Orae/r^'nrc printed In that 
very popular work : — 

**' Baking is one of the cheapest and 
mnst convenient ways of dressing a din- 
ner in small families; and 1 may say, 
that the oven is oUen the onfjf kitcMem 
a pnnr man har, if he wishes to enjoy a 
joint of meat at home with his family. 
I ** I ilo not me;m to deny the superior 
; excellence of roasting, to baking; but 
I some ioir.ts, when liaked, so nearly ap* 
i nro>tch to the s;«ine when roasted, that 
1 hiive known them to lie carried to the 
tabl(>, and eaten as such with great satis* 
faction. 

" Legs and loins of pork ; legs of mut- 
ton ; fillet-s oi veal ; and many other 
joints, will bake to great advantage if 
the meat be good, 1 mean well fed, ra- 
ther inclined to be fat; if the meat be 
poor, no baker can give satisfaction. 

^* When baking a joint of poor meat, 
liefore it hat: been half baked,! have seen 
it start from the bone, and shrivel up 
scarcely to be Iwlieved. 

*' Beftides those joints above-menCioo* 
ed, I shall enumerate a few other dishes 
which I can particularly recommend. 
See Pig, Goofie, Buttock of Beef, Ham."

BEKF.* — To secure prime beef or any 
other butchers' meat ot ttiiporior quality, 
for the larder, it is indi^|)en8able todenl 
with a reputable buiciicr. as he will 
ufcilher purchase nor kill interior stock. 
Certain economical caterers, however, 
will uot confine themselves to any parti- 



cular tradesman. To uich it it fecooi- 
mended to bear their wits about them to 
the shambles, for that shopkeeper that 
cannot secure a constant customer« ao- 
cording to the moral usages of a manet 
is less legardful of his reputation, and 
there is a general feeling of exultatkii 
amongst the slmpkcepers in a market* 
place, when one of these shamble- bunt- 
mg providers gets himself outwitted. 
He must be cunning indeed who it a 
mutch for the market-folks. 

The vigilance of three senses is ne- 
cessary to tliese perambulating pur- 
veyors, the sight, tlie touch, and the 
smell ; although tiie skilful prwider will 
depend alone upon the eye, as prime 
meat Icarc its sterling character oa tiM 
surface. 

True well-fed beef may be known at 
once to the skilful eye, by the texture 
and colour : the lean will exhibit an open 
gra'.n of a deep coral red, and the fat will 
appear of an healthy, oily smoothnetit 
inclining to white rather than yellow. 
The Fuel iu*m and white. Yellow fat k 
(Toner.ill V a suHicient test of interior beel^ 
though it is a common error to suppota 
the yellow tinge is a certain sign (H the 
beast having been fed on oil-cake. Oxca 
fatted for slaughter on corn and turnipe, 
will when killed fi-equently exhibit y«l- 
luw fut. 

fleii'er-beef of prime quality is scareelf 
iuf.T.^ior to ox-beef: the texture of tlie 
lean, however, is of a closer giain, of a 
paler coial red, and the lat whiter UiaD 
that of ox beef. 

Cow*beef is also distinguished from 
that of the ox, by the same characterii^ 
tics, only that in proportion to its greater

It has been a practice amongst a many 
farmers to feed oxen and calvei on ou 
cake, though by no means so prevaleat 
now as at that period when, a few yeaia 
ago, experimental agriculturists louitht 
to impiove nature, by crossing her in all 
her operations, until he that had bred 
tlie most perfect monster obtained the 
greatest prize. That much new and use* 
tul light has been thrown upon the sub- 
ject of breeding and feeding, is generally 
acknowledged, to the credit of manv 
^Mrientitic gentlemen, who have devotee 
their time and fortune to these purauito; 
but the artificial means resorted tou to 
etl'ect these ends, if pushed a little tur- 
thei, would have excluded wholesiMne 
beef and mutton from tlie larder. 

The best beef, and that which is aouglit 
by the mo:»t reputable butchers, is that

pounds, and liaving taken out the bone, 
lard it with a pound of iMUXin, cut it in 
bits, and season it with salt and spiceif 
The upper part of the beef, which is 
covered with fat, should not be larded. 
Next, take four ounces of powdered salt- 

f»etre and rub into the meat, that it may 
ook red ; put it in a ]>an with one ounce of 
bruised juniper berries, three 'jay leaves, 
a little thyme and basil, and one pound 
of coan*e salt ; let it remain eight days, 
the pan being well covered. Wbcn the 
iR«'^ic has tak^n the salt, wash it in warm 
water, and put some slices of bacon upon 
the upper part, or that which is covered 
with fat, tying a linen cloth over the 
whole with packthread ; then let it siew 
gently fur hve hours with a pint and a 
lialf of red wine, a quart of water, five or 
six onions, two cloves of garlic, four or 
five carn»ts, two parsnips, a bay leaf, 
thyme, basil, four or five cloves, parsley, 
gi-een onions^ and the quarter of a nut- 
fjieg. When it is done, leave it to cool in

Beef Salted. — Beef should be well 
siirinklcd, and a few hours afterwards 
huug to drain, before it is rubbed with 
tiic salt; which method, by cleanHing the 
i»eat fi-om the blood, serves to keep it 
from tasting Htrong: it should be turned 
<'vcr>- day ; and, if wanted soon, should 
be rubbed as often. A salting tub or 
lofid may bo used, and n cover to lit clo^. 
I'hi^c who une a good deal of salt iiieat, 
Aflll tind it answer well to bo'l up the 
I^oJde. skiin it, and, when cold, pjur it 
ftvex tnc meat that has been sprinkled

Take a lean piece of beef, and rub it «cU 
with brown sugar (some pour treacle over 
it) ; let it lie at least two days, turning it 
very often ; then wipe it, and salt it with 
common salt and salti)etre : beat the mII- 
petre fine, rub it well in, and turn iteverr 
day for {()urteen or fifteen days ; then rnl 
it very tight in a coarse clotti, and pctM 
it down with a large weight; hang it ID 
dry in a chimney, but turn it the botuno 
upwards ever)' <fay ; then boil it in pan|p 
water : it will cut into shivers like Dutco 
beef. 

Beef Salted lied^ which Is cxtrendiy

a day, then rub it with common salt.esll- 
petre, and bay salt, but only a hiiuiU pro- 
portion of the s.'ilti>etre, and vou may 
add a few grains of cochineal, all inline 
powder; rub the pickle every day into 
the meat for a week, then only tuin it. 

it will be ex«-eljent in ei^ ht days* In 
sixteen, drain it from the pickle, and lei 
it bo smoked at the oven mouth when 
heated with wood, or send it to the 
baker's ; a few days will smoke it. 

A little of the coarsest sugar nay be 
added to the salt. 

ItcHttf well, boiled tender withgreew 
or carrots. If to be grated as Dutch, 
then cut a lean bit, bod it till extremely 
tender, and, while liot, put it under a

zcstca of the oranges on a piece of su^ar, 
and as soon as it becomes coloured » scrape 
itofl', and grate again until all the seife

baking-plate with h(>t ashes, lay the 
mould in the midst of them, and place 
it in a moderate oven ; keep it open for

Modern experiments, thanks to the

science of chemistry to the improvement 
of the culinary art, have proved that water 
for all the purpofcs, of this department of 
rooking, can but boil. That galloping

over-notable housewives of the last agej

to no other end than to save a little time, 
at an enormous expense of fuel, and thus 
converting excellent meat from the lar-

BoiLjxo. — Mpat before boUing or 
roasting ;)lioiild be washed, and it h iin- 
provod in colour by soaking. ForroaRt- 
mg or baking, bowcver, before it w put 
on tiie spit or in the oven, it should be 
wiped and dried. 

It ia impoiisible to complete tlie opera- 
tion of boiling without due care in skim- 
ming the pot. The instant the water 
approaches boiling heat* the scum which 
riiM^s to the surface inust be cleared oiT; 
and ill this early state of the process, 
from tlie op'' ration of the heat disengag- 
ing the coagulated matter, which thus 
floats the skimming muMt be patiently 
followed up, or it will attach itself to the 
meiit, and thereby spoil its appearance. 
The cojk mu>t not neglect to skim dur- 
ing the whole process, though the coa- 
guluin rises Icfh frequently Uie longer it 
Iwils, By strict attention to this impor- 
tant part of the process of boiling, the 
cu»U^in of wrapping the meat in a cloth, 
may b<> dispensed with. Indeed, the 
only reason assigned for thip, in to pre- 
serve its appearance; whilstt if the pot 
l)e carefully skimmed, the meat will b'- 
cooked clean and pure, and come out of 
the vi'-'sr] in which it is boiled, still 
more delicate, white and firm, than when 
BO wrapped up— the flavour too is im- 
proved [»y the absence o: the cloth. 

The leainedinthe art of l)oiling re- 
commend different periods for th*» com- 
l^flotion of the process, f»ome allowing 
hfteen minutes to each pound— others 
twenty, and *ome even more. All the 
l)est authorities*, however, as Dr. Kit- 
cliiner, Accum, IVIrs. Kundell, and 
oiIhts, Hirree in this, that the longer tiic 
boiling, the more perfect the operation. 
The French cuisinier may claim the 
honours of a scientific stew, but the Eng- 
lish c'l-ifc affainst tlie whole world for a 
delicate boil. 

It is nf consequence, as before said, 
to suit the cooking vespel to the joint, 
for tlipre should be no space for super- 
fluous water. The scientific allowance 
iNMUfT about a p<nt of water to a pound 
of nicar. It is suiTicient that the joint 
l)e entirely covered, as the richness of 
the juicf'S are be«t preserved in propor- 
tion to the least quantity of water. The 
liiiuo!-, indeed, thus becomes broih. and 
should be conseauently preserved, to 
iif>e for that useful purpose, as by thus 
Hlowly boiling, or simmering, it imbibes 
no inconsiderable portion of savoury 
nutriment. 

As the water wastes whilst boiling by 
cvaporat'on, the pot should be replenish- 
ed, for the water must constantly cover 
the meat. A little cold water, too, ac- 



celerates the rising of the scum to the 
sui face* 

When taken from the pot, the neat 
must be carefully wiped. Some use a 
clean clotli for this purpose, but a sponge 
previously dipped in hot water, and 
wrung dry, is more convenient. This is 
done Dy wringing and clecinsing the 
sponge in hot water prepared at hand. 
Be careful not to let tlte meat stand, bat 
send it to table with all conveniettt 
speed, or it will darken in eompleuon. 
and Itecomc hard. Boiled meat, as well 
as roast, cannot be served too hot. 

BOUCHEES de Damet*-yi\x vilh 
six eggs, a quarter of a pound of tnpar*

These (touchvca require great attention 
in baking, as the sugar is apt to dissolve

BREWING.— Much indiffen'nt beer 
is made in private famiIio:«, even where 
there is no sparing of materials, for tho 
mere want of hystem and economy in 
thf^ management. 

In the fii*st place, attention sliould be 
paid to the state ot the utensils used in 
the operation, and all necetisary prepa- 
rations made the day before the act of 
brewing commences ; on which day, lee 
the water be hented in the copper that it 
mav be well cletinsed ; also cleanse the 
casks, mash-tub. coolers, &c. When 
this business is dispatched, fill the cop- 

!)er, and prepare all things in readinessi 
or next moming. 

The allowance of malt for Strong Beer 
must be ten bushels to the hogshead. 
For ^4le^ nine bushels to tlie hogshead. 
The copper for making a hoiishead of 
beer or ale should contain full seventy 
gallons, because the hogshead of beer 
measure holds sixty-three gallons, and 
there should be the surplus measure al- 
lowed (or the liops, and the working them

about to advantage when the water boils, 
to prevent waste. With this copper four 
boilings will afibrd two hogi^heads of 
strong beer or table ale, and two of table 
beer. 

The malt should be ground four or five 
days before use, and be kept very clean. 
The necessary ingredients being ready, 
the water must be made to 1x>tl rapidly, 
wtiioli done, the copper fire must then 
be damped. The malt having been pre- 
viously put into the mashing-tub (re- 
serving naif a bushel) as soon as the 
steam from the boiling nvater begins to 
subbide, the water is poured upon it to 
wet the malt so as to render it of a con> 
Bisicnce stiflf enoHgh to be mashed ; it 
should then remain covered over for a 
quarter of an hour, when more water is 
added and it is mashed as before; let it 
stand for a few minutes, and then add the 
wliole quantity of water, accordingly as 
it is intended to have the beer more or 
less strong. Whilst the water is^ lading 
on, the mash must be kept stirring with 
a pole. When well mashed, run the big 
pud «f the mash-oar through the middle 
f>f it to give it air, then put the spare 
half bushel of malt upon the mash ; and 
rover the tub over with sacks to keep the 
steam and spirit of the malt in, and let 
it remain two hours; then let it run into 
the receiver^ and mash again for the 
second wort m the same manner as the 
first, excepting that the water must be 
rooliT, and it must not stand more than 
half the time. 

Both these wort^ are now mixed toge- 
th(>r, and the quantity of hops determined 
iiIK>n are added, when the liquor mHSt 
\}o put into the copper, which being 
closely covered, let it boil gently for two 
hours, then let the liquor into the re- 
ceiver, and the hops be strained there- 
from into the coolers. 

When cool, the Ixu-m or yeast, which 
should be white and sweet, is added, and 
the liquor well stirred from the bottom 
with a wooden bowK turniatf it up topsy- 
turvy in the middle of each tub, which 
occiisions the beer to fennent. If, how- 
ever, it happens that in about two hours 
the fermentation is not favourable, it 
huA l)een checked ; in which case, put the 
ni'uth.oar. &c. across the tubs, and cover 
thorn with sacks to encourage the fer- 
mentation ; when the last thing at night, 
and tlie first in the morning should be 
the stirring them well up again. Be 
careful that the tubs be not too full to 
work over in the night. 

The next mominjs, skim the greater 
part of the yeast oflfV and prepare lo tun 
it. Let the casks be taken quite clean 
and warm into the cellars, which pro- 



motes the beer's working. It is reeoai- 
mended to fling a gallon or two c»f botliaf 
water in each, and turn it out agaia. 
Examine the cork and vent hold, and 
when the casks are filled, reserve mnm 
spare beer, that as It works in the caiki 
you may fill them up in the ceJlenfDr 
the waste. As soon aa full, take two 
pounds of fine wheat flour, and beat it op 
smooth with aome of the new beer ia a 
pail, with a wisp, and divide It between 
the two casks, keeping it well atlrzed vp 
near the bottom for a quarter of an boor. 
The flour thus prepared, gives to beer 
and ale a fine soft quality, and, wfaiie 
under fermentation, adds to its flavoDr, 
its mantling, &c. 

When this flour is put in thecMhi» 
each should be stirred with a long stidi 
for a fe«r minutes ; then put the tin oooop 
into the upper cork-hole for the beer to 
work through, and attend to it three or 
four times a day, particularly the last 
thing at night, and first in the momiiM; 
and when the fermentation is done wont- 
ing, which is usually an operation of 
three or four days, clean the outsidcs of 
the casks, and put in the beer, the bops 
saved in the pail, equally divided into 
each, stirring them about, which opex^ 
tioB fines all beers, and then bung them 
tight down with a piece of coarse linsa 
doth under the bung, if completely dooe 
working, but not else. 

For small, or table beer, there most be 
a third mashing. Reserve a pail-ftiU of 
the strong beer to add to the small. 
IjCt the water, already heated in the cop- 
per, when within a few minutss of bou* 
ing, be poun>d on the malt, keeping it 
mashed as before ; then add the pail ef 
strong, and cover it over with sacks ss 
before mentioned, with the raaah osr 
standing in the middle, and let it remain 
sn hour. Then fill the copper with the 
liquor, and let it boil very gently lor an 
hour. Tlie same preparation of floor and 
beer, should in the like proportion be 
added to the table beer. 

For good substantial strong beer or ak, 
and of fine flavour, there should be si* 
lowed one pound of hops for every bushel 
of malt. 

Hops that are good, and entirely fine 
from adulteration, should be of a fine 
sweet smell, full of ripe seed, of a dear 
pale yellow colour, and clammy, which 
evinces their strength ; such an artida 
ameliorates and preserves all beers. The 
best hops arc those produced in Kent- 

The great secret of fining all beers, t» 
render them of a clear brilliant colottr. 
is to take out three quarters of a pailfol 
of the hops from the copper, when they

PoRTEB. — It is generally held that 
porter, to be good, |must necessarily be 
brewed in large quantities; this, how- 
ever, is a popular error. Excellent por- 
ter may be brewed in private familiee. 
and by proper management, so ordered, 
that ample time between each brewing 
may be allowed for it to refine for use. 
Those families therefore wbo have con- 
venient utensils for brewing strong 
beers and ales, and who are acquainted 
with the process for making them suo-' 
cesefully, may also add porter to the 
cellar stock, and thereby supply theur 
tables with that truly Engliflh beverag^ 
and regale their friends with a tankar-d 
of that cool, refreshing, and wholesome 
liquor, pure, genuine, and free from 
those pernicious adulterations which are 
sometimes practised by the public brewer 
and toe often by the publican, by whose 
cheating rapacity the health of his cuo- 
tomers is destroyed, and the reputatkin 
of the brewer who serves his tap sufiers 
accordingly. It is well known that the 
excisemen are instructed to keep a vigi- 
lant eye upon the breweries^ to prevent 
the use of deleterious drugs, in the conk- 
position of beer, which instructions they 
more readily obey, as a heavy penalty n 
attached on detection of such mal-prao- 
tises ; whilst the publican, who is com- 
monly the most culpable, for his share 
in the adulteration of beer, is generally 
allowed to escape detection. It tv'oula 
be well, therefore, that the publican 
should be liable to an equal penalty with 
the brewer, as his risk is less, and his 

Krofits certain, a very liberal allowance 
eing granted to all retailers of London 
porter. 

Tlie brewing of porter is nearly by the 
same process as the brewing of ale. The 
mash, however,tmu8t be made of a fine, 
high dried, sweet, full malt, (which is 
cheaper than the pale malt used tor 
brewing the titrong beer and ale) ; and 
full, fine, sweet, brown hops. 

It is not necessary for a porter brewer 
to give from ten to twenty shillings per 
hundred weight, for colour or appear- 
ance in hops, when in actual value and 
I strength they may be thirty per cent, in- 
I ferier for his purposes *, such bright and

Tas Cellar.— A good brewer, ccllar- 
■n, &c. will take delight in the well- 
eHmngof the cellar. Attention must 
be Mud to cleanliness both in his person 
MS bHeiness ; every thing in the cellar 
eoBieqoently should be kept in due 
erder. The brewer, or cellar-man to the 
adHemin, or gentleman, who maintains 
e Jbuce establishment, should occupy 
Weflf every roomiag in the cellars. 
The fnUowing duties are incumbent— 

Dnrine the summer months, ha\'e the 
heer oeUars and stairs clean washed 
weddy^and particularly under the casks. 
BbipCy the tap-tubs daily, into a cask 
hipt nr the purpose of containing the 
■In^ nod grounds ; for tlie cellars, on 
opeDlng.should always smell pure and 
ewvet. By attention to these oinces, the 
cellar B are not only pleasant to enter, 
tat the beer is kept fine and cool during 
the hot months; wiiereas, by inattention 
lodeenltnesB, a filthy cellar will cause 
the beer to turn sour. 

Daring the winter months, scraping 
■id tweeping out the cellars once a 
week will be sufficient. Observe, all 
wHirs^ in the winter, cannot be kept too 
ckee end warm, for without great atten- 
tioo on this point, the liquors cannot 
thrive. 

The following necessaries should be 
yravided for cellars to large establish- 
■ents. Those families who brew on a 
^oeJier soile, will apply their uses, 
aeeording to their proportionate con- 



SeltaUe shot, and lead canister* with

&c. A pair of strong folding steps. Half 
a dozen mahogany spigots and fauceta, 
about the size of the little finger, to be

lOlLING.*— The amateur of a 
who would secure a chop or steak, 
*i to perfection, is recommended to 
his way to the neighbourhood of 
on*f Royal Exchange, where the 
id mystery of that summary pro- 
f savoury cookerv. has long attained 
Itimatum of excelleuce. There the 
urns with never ceasing brightness, 
•idiron hasnottinte to cool, and the 
iient commercialist, to whom time 
perty^ is never doomed to wait, 
tain It is, that a chop or steak is 
ten eaten in perfectkm, at the table 
rivate family, though, there is no 
tent reason why it should be so; for, 
boiling, 80 in broilhig, the diflicul- 



ties of the art vanish, where attention i< 
not wanting. The process is more sim- 
ple than that of any other method of 
dressing meat, the operation is quick, and 
the object under the hand and eye of the 
osok, Irom the moment of its buing put 
upon the gridiron, to that of its comple* 
tu>n. 

The cook must prepare her fire for the 
operatk>n in due time; when ready, it 
should he clear and brightr-to free from 
black ooal or smoke, that the chop or 
steak m^y come from the gridion with- 
out blemish or taint of sulphur or smoke. 

The best fuel for a broil is composed 
of charcoal and coke, as litUe smoke is 
emitted from either, even on commenc- 
ing the fire ; and when well ignited, it la 
entirely fi ee from it. Coke, added to a 
brisk coal fire, also burns bright, and is 
well suited for the operation; though 
with care, a proper fire may be made of 
good sea-cooJ. 

Ceruin unqualified declaimers upon a 
broil, hold various opinions, touching the 
proper thickness of^ a steak; though at 
the most celebrated chop-houseb, the 
cooks, unless expressly dctdred other- 
wise, confine the cut to somewhat more 
than half, yet less than the thick nrss of 
three-quarters of an inch. This adjust- 
ment of the proportion of the stratum of 
the delicious rump, is moreover accord- 
ing to the statute law ol the thrice learn- 
ed conclave, tlie Bet^ Steak Club: 
amongst whose members, from the epoch 
ol its original founds, George Lambert^ 
and his distinguished convives, to the 
present day, may be numbered the most 
accomplished gtmrnuinda of this renown- 
ed land of good cheer. 

*** The choicest steak, moreover, be 
it hereby known, on the authoritjr of one 
of the best informed butchers in this 
great metropolis, who served the Beef 
Steak Club, the last season, is cut from 
the rump of a prime Norfolk-fed Scot ! 

There is this, aniongHt other disadvsn- 
tages, in cutting too thick a steak, the 
outKidc is likely to be scorched to h 'my 
hardness, before the interior is half- cook- 
ed ; hence, to say nothing of the misery 
of tnose who have not the advantage of 
capacious mouths, the oisappointed epi- 
cure must either wait until it is put again 
upon the gridiron, or instead ol eating it 
rare, be constrained to eat it raw. 

No gridiron should be used, but those 
with fluted tiars, which forming channels, 
the greater part of the fat, which other- 
wise falls into the fire and scorches the 
•teak, is drawn off into a gutter at 
the bottom. The gridiron should be 
thoroughly heated« and the bais rubbed 
with beef or mutton tnet, previously to

cabbage brotli will luive been all ab- 
^o^bed ; some persons, consequently, add 
more hotbrotn to it at the moment of 
berving: but the true method of serving 
it a la Protfen^ale, is to send it up dry, 
u<ing with it, at table, only the finest 
oj].

as cork. 

Cabbage Aaffv^/.*— Take tbe half of 
a middling sized cabbage, boil it for half 
an hour, and then change it in cold 
water, Miuerze it well, and take out the

and put it in a stew-pan with a slice of 
good butter; turn it a few times oter 
the fire, and shake in Home flour ; put in 
sufficient gravy to give colour to the in- 
gofit ; let it boil over a slow fire till the 
cabbage is done, and reduced to a thick 
t*aucc ; season it with salt, coarse pep- 
per, and a little grated nutmeg, aerre 
under any meat you think proper. 

Cabbage Rago(it,—ScB\doDe cabbage 
cut into quarters, (savoys are best);

pi^tty high of pepper. 

Cabbage RagoQi.— Divide a cabboge 
in the middle, blanch it in hot water, 
squeeze it, tie it with packtliread, and

braize; when it is stewed, drain ir, un- 
tie it, cut itin little slices into a sauce- 
pan, and let it dimmer with some cullii

a stew-pan with a piece of butter, some 
salt ana pe^pper, and let it stew over a 
moderate fire, stirrinfr it very frequently 
whilst dressing, to mix it well with the 
butter. 

Cabbages (Aei/).— They are mostly 
stewed to eat with ham, bacon, or smckea 
sausages, though sometimes without any 
meat ; they are very strong eating, ana 
should be first scalded, then stewed with 
butter, pepper, salt, and cloves ; and 
vinegar added to it just before serving: 
they are reckoned wholesome in ml

quantity of water you require for aoun ; 
then add «ome cabbages previounly 
blanched, and if you like, someMUiiagefl ; 
pepper and shU the aoup, but take rare to 
puc very little mlt,on accountof the bacon. 
Skim well before you put in the cab- 
baijres. This receipt is the same in most 
of the French cookery books, except that 
some tell you, that when the cabbage 
and bacon are done, you should soak a 
few slices of bread in some of the broth, 
and then mix them with the whole soup. 

Cabbage Soup, with Carrots and 
On/oMS.*— Line a stewpan with bards of 
bacon, then blanch a cabbage in boiling

ciently done, dress it on a dish, and 
serve.

into each of your cabbages, (in the place 
of the hearts), and tie them up with 
packthread. Line a stewpan with slices

butter, flour, and stock, properly season- 
ed ; heat up the cabbaire in this roMTy 
being careful that it does not break. 
Keep adding stock from time to time, ao 
that the cabbagre may be always oorered.

what is witliin ; tie the cabbage with pack- 
thread, and stew it with some stock, a 
little salt, and coarse pepper, roots,

of Eurooe, and we have them in some of 
our gardens ; but Toulon is the principal 

Elace for them. Some are sent us from 
yons, but they are flatter, and not so 
firm. Some come from Minorca, but 
they are salt and disagreeable. They 
gather the buds from the blossoms before 
they open, then spread them upon the 
floor of a room where no sun enters, and 
there let them lie till they be^n to 
wither. They then throw them mto a 
tub of sharp vinegar, and after three 
davH, they add a quantity of bay-salt. 
When this is disisoived, they are fit for 
packing, and are sent to all parts of 
Europe. The finest capers are thos^e of 
a moderate size, firm, and cloi*e, and 
8uch ashave the pickle hiichly flavoured. 
Those which are 6oft, flabby, and half 
open, are of little value. 

Capl'bs, Fine and C&ar**.*— The fine 
capers are made use of in garnishing 
dressed salads, and to put whole inio 
sauces; the coarser sorts are used in 
sauces where it is necessary to chup up 
the capers. 

Caper Sauce for Fish, — Take some 
melted butter, into which throw a small 
bit of glaze ; and when the sauce is in a 
state of readineM, throw into it some 
choice capers, salt, and pepper, and a 
spoonful of essence of ancbovie?. 

Caper Suuge d la Francoise.^Tnke 
some capers, cut them small ; put f^omc 
essence of ham into a small saucepan, 
with a little pepper ; let it boil, then put 
in the capers ; let thein boil up two or 
three times, and pour into a boat. 

Capca Sauce (to imttate),—Bo\l some 
parsley very ilowly, to let it becjme ot a 
Dad colour, then cut it up, (but do not 
chop it fine) ; put it into melted butter, 
wiih a tea-spcwnful of salt, and a desfc'Tt- 
spoonful of vinegar. Boil up, and then 
serve. 

Caper Sauce for Ifeo/.—Take sorr#p 

capers, chop half of them very fine, and 

put the reift in whole* Then cLup i^ume

up, and then pour them into a sauce- 
boat. 

Caper Saueefvr J/m^.— Having some 

batter sauce made hot, mix in a few 

chopped capers, with one squeeze of 

, lemon-juice ; melted butter will make 

the same, but of an inferior kind. 

CAPI LLAIRE, To 3/aAre.— Take four- 
teen pounds of sugar, three pounds of 
coarse suKar, six eggs beat in with the 
shells, three quarts of water : boil it up 
twice ; skim it well, then add to it a 
quarter uf a pint of orange-flower water; 
strain it through a jelly- ba^, and put it 
into lx>ctles ; when cold, mix a smMnful 
or two of this syrup, as it is liked for 
sweetness in a draught of warm or cold 
water. 

Capillaire, Syrup ^.•— The capil- 
laire of Canada, although that ot Munt- 
pellier is equally good, is a very odo- 
riferous vegetable, light and agreeable, 
but s'j extremely volatile, that the 
greatest part of it is dissipated during 
the preparation of the syrup. To i>re- 
scrve then the odour of the capilUire, 
when your syrup is sufficiently done, 
pour it, whilst boiling, upon some fresh 
capillaire coaisely chopped up; then 
cover your vcsaeL and let it stand until 
it is quite cold, tlien pjiss it through a 
bolting-cloth to separate it from the 
Icavcd of the capillaire. 

Take one ounce of the capillaire from 
Canada; put it into a glazed pan, pour 
upon it four pints of boiling water, leave 
it to infiiKc lor twelve hours over some 
warm a^'hcs ; btrain it and let it run into 
a vessel, it will give you a strong tinc- 
ture of capillaire ; melt in tliis tincture 
lour pounds of sugar, put the whole into 
a preserving- (lan, and put it on the fire, 
and clarity it with the white of an egg, 
continue the cooking; when your svrup 
'v^pcrU, put some fresh capillaire, chop- 
ped, into a pan, and pour your syrup, 
whilH boiling, upon it; cover your pan 
carefully, and let it cool ; when vour 
svrup is cold, you may flavour it if you 
])lease. Put it into bottles, and cork 
them hermetically. 

Capillaire, Sgrup €f.* — Take some 
good capillaire, chop it up, not very 
Kinall. put it upon a sieve ; pour upon it 
some lioiiiiig water, and tlien let it in- 
fuse for ten hours in a vessel well co- 
vered ; fitrain this infusion, and put into 
it some sugar boiled au caui ; clarify 
this syrup with the whites of eg^s 
whipped; skim it till it is very clear: 
when it rises, take it ofTthe fire, and 
leave it to oool, then put it into bot* 
ties. 



Viard and Beauvilliers, irhosc reoeiftl 
are nearly the same, boil their caplllaiR 
for a quarter of an hour in rivcr« water; 
after having passed this boiling throogl 
a sieve, they put into it somepowdar 
sugar, and clanfy their syrup with water. 
or a whole egg beaten up ; then akim it 
and when it is very clear and haa boiW 
au Uta^^ they Uke it off the fire, and p« 
into it some orange-flower water, ani 
strain it through a napkin or strainlnir 
bag, leaving it to cool before putting I 
into bottles. 

For three pints and a half of sfrnp 
you must use two good ounoea of ca 
pillaire, four pinu of wster, and im 

Couiids of sugar, powder-sugar is tb 
est, as it prevents syrups from candy 
ing. 

Capillaire, <Syrvp r/.— Put anoanai 
of the leaves of the herb called Maiden 
hair, for a moment, into boiling water 
take them out, and put them in a litti 
tepid water, leaving them to infu«efn 
at least twelve hours upon hot embeit 
then strain them through a sieve; nei 
put a pound of sugar into a saucepan 
with a good glass of water ; boil it to thi 
same degree as for syrup of violets, tbei 
put to it the capillaire, or Maidcn-bai 
water, not sufl'ering it to boil ; uke I 
ofl'the lire as soon as it iswellmim 
with the sugar ; put it into an earthei 
pan closely covered, and set the pat 
during three days, over hot emDen 
keeping tlie heat as equal as you can, bi 
uot too violent. When the syrup wl 
extend into a strong thread between yoc 
fingers, put it into t)ottles, taking cai 
not to cork them till the syrup is qnil 
cold. 

CAPiLLimE Sjnrp.— Take two qnar 
of fine syrup, and boil it to a blow ; bo 
twice or three times, two ^ills and a ba 
of orange-flower water, skimming it a 
the tinrte ; put it into new bottles aa 
cork it up tne next day ; put pieces <

Cardoons d VEsteuce with Marrow*^' 
Tlie same preparation as for Spanish 
cardoons, receipt second. Take a few 
pieces of beef- marrow, all ot a size, 
which yen put to disgorge in warm 
water, to draw out all the blood. When

half a pint of white wine, a fagot of 
sweet herbs, a good bit of butter, pepper 
and salt; when three parts doQe, put 
scalded carp roes into it, and finish the 
boilinft (they require no longer than time 
enough to finish tbeonions very tender); 
reduce the sauce pretty thick; put the 
roes into the middle of the ditth, and the 
onions round ; mix a little spinach-juice 
with the sauce, to give it a pale green 
colour, or a strong green if you think 
proper. Serve the sauce upon the onions 
only, or in the bottom of the dish, and 
the rest upon it ; garnish it round with 
fried bread. Carp roes are also dressed

pint of water ; dose the vessel tight, and 
let it stand several davs. At the end of 
that time di^il it in tne bain marie. If 
the brandy is of the proper strength, the 
three quarts will yield two of the liquor : 
to which put three pounds and a half of 
sugar, disMlved in three pints and a half 
(if water; pass the whole through a 
straining bag, or filter it through pa- 
per. 

Oil of cedrats is made in the same

CHEESE.^To select good cheese is a 
department of marice ting tliat requires 
pett jadgment ; a nice palate, nnd a 
■nairi ve noee are the two chief rf qiiisites ; 
tat the eye is a necesiiary organ, not 
ealy far detecting what escAj^tes the en- 
noy of these senses, as mites, decay, 
«c-« out with good judges it will usually 
Idl a prime cheese from an indlQercnt 
Qae» by the texture and colour alone. 

In cnooaing tliis necessary article, at- 
miion must be paid to the appearance 
of the rind. Cfaeiihire cheese, from a 
good dairfi is in its prime at two years, 
fnfided ft has been well kept. A damp 
MOfchouse produces premature decay, 
md Alia it with mites. 

Cheeae, even of the finest quality, is 
apt to deceive those unacquainted with 
foe article, both in tssre and smell, when 
Jodpng ^y the taster, or when first cut. 
aa it will freouenily posfiets a strong and 
■nplcMant flavour, although in a few 
dan alter being cut, exposure to the air 
win render it pure and agreeable to the 
anell and ta!«te. It is hence the custom 
with experienced caterers to Iav in a 
etBvk of Chef>h're cheese, and to keep it 
In a dr^ cellar in saw- (lust, in a box, by 
which,in two or three months,!? improves, 
and is fit to cut. It is then well to divide 
it into two parts, or to take out a fourth, 
according to its size ; eprpad butter on 
the part to be rei<erveu, and keep it in 
a dry place; tbst for u^e should be ex- 
posed in the larder on the choose nheir, 
three or four daysi, wh<>n it will lie ready 
for tlie tal>le. A certain late worthy Al- 
derman and Vintner, fmied for his know- 
ledge of the larder, fur many years was 
aecnatomed to put Cheshire cheoiies in a 
mtkf cover them with a lKt.»ket, and 
barytbem under bib humnier stock ot 
coals, arid in the winter, as ihey reduced, 
he uaed to say. '* Now \» the time for my 
oklClie!<hire." Nocheeiie ofeipial fla- 
vour, perhaps, was eaten in the city of 
LondoD.

lea treat for the most refined palate, an<1 
il ■eneraliy preferred at the tables o( the 
ficaStCvcn by those Amphytrions, whose 



authority few will be hardy enough to 
dispute. 

Stilton cheese, made In May or Jane, 
is usually served at table at Chrittmas. 
If made at a capital dairy, however, it la 
in better order at ten, or even twelve 
months, or, if well managed, even at a 
later period. 

It 18 customary with certain tavern- 
keepers to produce an artificial ripenesa 
on Stilton, to please those pseodo con- 
noisseurs, their vain customers, who , 
boast loudly of their supeiior taste in 
these matters, when in the chatr^ and 
who verify the couplet of the iaimitable 
poet— 

*' Doubtless the pleasure Is aa great 
In being cheated as to cheat." 

Mine host, manages the matter thus : — 
A Stilton, with a rugged and picturesque 
coat, is tapped, and in the aperture is 
inserted a small piece of mite-iouehed old 
Cheshire, and then stopped with a wet 
cloth. In three weeks or a month it la 
ripe enough, and relished by the con- 
vives with its concomitant, a glass of 
port, as a bonne bouche fit for the gods ! 

Certain epicures are ^ accustomed to 
make a conical excavation on the top of 
a Stilton, and to pour therein from two 
to four glasses, or even more, of port, 
claret, or Madeira wine, which being 
abttorbed for three weeks or a month, 
they maintain, improves its flavour. 
There is no disputing with a variety of 
t'uttes. On iiome occasions an accidental 
flavour may be thus attained, which may 
l)e palatable; but, on the authority of 
one of the best judges of thene matter^, 
we venture to sayj that many a prime 
Stilton has been spoiled by such whimtiical 
practices ; and we are assured, as well by 
the dairyman, cheesemonger, and w that 
the firKt cooks, that the finest Stilton, 
which ripeni« without any artificial aid. 

North Wilt»hire cheese has lonK, ac- 
quired deserved celebrity, \)e\n^ rich, 
and of fine flavour ; thefc bre fit for the 
table at nine months, but, if carefully 
kept, they are in perfection at twelve 
months. 

Double Gloucester, is also a cheese in 
Kreat repute, and if made at a good dairy 
is in prime order fn>m nine to twelve 
months. Thi« makes an excellent Welch 
rabl»it, and is capital for a stew, if care- 
fully dreiwed in n cheese'toas.er. 

Smgle Gloucester, nhich, when suc- 
cesslully made, is ol a fine delicate fla- 
vour, is Kcnerally used at the taverns 
for a Welch rabbit. It is fit for the table 
in five or six months.

the beft dairies, being of a delicate fla- 
vour, and agreeable texture, ii preferred 
to all otberB, by the cogfioiceniin for 
toasting. A Welch rabbit, capitally 
cooked, of Derbyshire cheese, is served 
with Mai at the best appointed tables. 

Cheddar cheese is alra in high esteem 
at the best tables. It is in its prime from 
nine to twelve months. 

Dunlop cheese, made in the parish of 
Dunlop, in Ayrcinire, is in high esteem 
at the first Scottish tables, and is consi- 
dered a handsnme present to ttn English 
family ; afid due honours are paid to the 
Ayrf^nire dairies, asoften as it U set upon 
the English board. 'I'he Great Unlcnown 
has celebrated the Dunlop cheese in his 
*' Heart of Mid Lothian.'' 

Of cream cheeses, there are various 
sortit, and for which the English dairies 
are famed. Amongst otltr^^ the Cotten- 
ham, when in its prime, is of delicious 
flavour. The Balh cream chee»<! is aUo 
delectable, and others, which are eaten 
equally new, particularly those from a 
certain town in Bedfordshire, the name 
of which wc do not recollect ; these, and 
many more nf excel lent quality, are thin 
in form; the StiVton is also a cream 
cheef^, tlinugh amongst the thickest 
that come (rom an English dairy. 

Of foreign cheese, the Parmesan, 
which being fir<*t made at Parma, in 
Italy, hence derives its name, still 
maintains pre-eminence over all others. 
The mar.ufitcturc ot this cheese was 
formerly confined to the dairies of Parma 
and PiacetiLu ; and where, for a long 

f>eriod, the lw*8t were made; rf late, 
lowever, the district of Lodi is most 
celebrated for thi« cheese. 

The Gruyerc from Switzerland, the 
Rocbefort^ made of ewes' milk, and the 
Ne'.ifchatel frosn France, are cheeses 
served as df'Iicacies upon an English 
table ; but the true E)ngli^h Chefihire is 
held superior to all thene, even by the 
learned ga'ttronomists of Paris. 

In having the care of the cheese for 
the parlour, or for the funilv in general, 
says an anonymous writer, let a broad 
hanging slieli be hung, either in the 
wine or sti-ong beer cellar, as neither 
rats nor mice can then get at the cheese. 

If you keop cream cbeesi-s, put them 
between t«vo plates or dishen to ripen, 
with some fresh haves fro'ii the garden, 
and turn them every morning ; and for 
all other cheeson have a rack or two 
made in the cellar, for it will be a nneans 
of improving thorn ilhily. A lance spare 
in the rack shoulil be left for the Che- 
shire, brick -bit. and dolphin cheeses, 
&r. Sec.; and nothinv impmveA them, or 
makes ttieui go farther, than putting 



three or four on each pipe or cask of 
wine, and brushing and turning them 
every week ; but if there are no caaka of 
wine, put them on the tops of the stronf 
beer casks. Cheere, even of an inferior 
quality, if thus manssed, will become 
much richer, fine, and melloir. Thty 
mukit he turned alternately. 

The cheeFe should not be broughtfrom 
the rack to the parlour, but at the mo- 
ment it is wanted, and should be return* 
ed to the rack as soon as taken ffom 
table. Be careful to use those that are 
ripe and mellow first. 

Cheeses of all sorts, are known to be 
the best which have smooth thin coattt 
and those chosen which are the heavieat; 
for, although they be of the 8ame8in« 
yet theydifler materially in that point; 
as all fat, good che«'seis the heaviest. 

The round Dutch cheese, of the best 
qunlity, and not too salt, which b a com- 
mon failing with them, is not nnfre- 
quentlyused for toasting, and witk sue- 
ceps. This and other cheeses, made of 
skim milk, are considered better for tbmt 
purpose, and eat richer and more agree- 
ably to the i>a(ate than even the besi 
North Wiltshire, indubitably one of the 
richest of English cheeses. The fatty 
richness of this material, constitutes not 
the desired properties for tosbting, as the 
inferior chec4e$i arc, when toasted, found 
to be richer, rofier in consistence, less 
ropy, and superior in flavour, than even 
Stilton. 

Cheeses that l»ecome tainted with 
mires, are recommended by a Derby- 
shire lady, well acquainted with the oper- 
ations of the dairy, to t>e wiped, and 
then put into a pot in which mutton has 
been cooked, wiiilst the water is yet hola 
and made to l)oil a few seconds, then to 
be taken out, immediately wiped, driedt 
and put away in a dry place. 

Cheese, wr//^ciff/.— Take a gallon of 
new milk, two qunrts of cream, nutmeg, 
mace, and cinuHmon, all well pounded ; 
boil these in milk; then put in eight 
eiigs, six or eight spnnnKful of wine vine- 
gar to turn the milk ; let it Imil till it 
comes to a tender curd ; tie it up in a 
cheese-cloth, and let it hang six or eight 
hours to drain ; then open it, take out the 
spice, sweeten it with sugar and rose- 
water; put it into a cullender, let it 
stand an hour more, then turn it i»ui, 
and serve it up in a dish, with cream 
under it. 

Chhese ifn'ocAe.*— Make a brioche in 
the usual wny, and when ready for tmk- 
ing, s|)if*ad it over the t>oard, and stiew 
oyer it some Gruycre cheehe, cut into 
dice, in the proportion of a quarter of a 
pound of cheese to a pound of brioche

Cheese Poumled.^THkfi a pound of 
good mellow Cheddar, Cheshire, or North 
^Viltshlrc cheese, cut it into thin bits; 
if the cheese is dry, add to it three 
ounces of frch butter ; if it is tolerahly 
moist, two ounces of butter will be suffi- 
cient ; pound and rub them well toge'her 
in a mortar till it is quite smooth. 
Spread on bread, it makes an excellent 
luncheon or supper. You may, if you 
plf^afe. pound with it curry powder, 
ground spice, black pepper, cayenne, 
and a little made mustara ; and moisten 
vitli a glass of sherry. If pressed down 
haid in ajar, and covered with clarifi«'d 
butter, it will keep for several days in 
c Tol weather. 

Cheese to Preserve SmtwL — Wash it 
in warm whey, wipe it once a month, and 
keep it on a rack. If you wish it to 
ripen, ^>ut it into a damp cellnr, which 
will bring it forward, when a whole 
cheese is cut, the larger quantity shonid 
be spread inside with butter, and the 
outside should be wiped to preserve it. 
To keep that which is in daily use 
moist, let a clean cloth be wrung out 



from cold water, and wrapped round the 
cheese wheu carried from table. 

Cheese Pf^fft. — Beat in a mortar, half 
a pint of cheese curd (stiained from the 
whey) very fine, with a spoonful and a 
half of flour, three eggs, leaving out two 
whites, a spoonful of orange-flower water, 
a ouarter of a nutmeg, and sugar to 
mske it rather sweet. Lay a liitla <tf

Cheshire cheese, mix it with the yolki 
of two eggs, four ounces of grated bread. 
and three ounces of butter ; beat the 
whole well in a mortar, with a deseert 
spoonful of mustard, and a little salt ano

proper pieces ; lay the paste, as above, 
thick upon them, put them into a Dotcb 
oven covered with a dish, till hot through, 
remove the dish, and let the cheese 
brown a little. Serve as hotai postiUe. 

Cheese, Sage. — Bruise the topa of 
young red SAge in a mortar, with aome 
leaves ol spinach, and squeeze the jaice ; 
mix it with the rennet in the milk, more 
or less, according as you like fM ook>ur

with rennet alone, aad the other part 
with rennet and sage juice. These muat 
l>c made as you would make two distinct 
cheeses, and put into the presses atihfl

stood in the presses for half an hour, 
take them out, and cut some equate 
pieucs, or long slips out of the plain 
dieese, and lay them by on a plate ; then 
cut the same nunr.ber of pieces out of the

and immediately put the pieces of the 
sage cheese into tue places that you cut 
in the plain cheese, and the pieces that 
you took out of the plain cheese into the

which tiie pieces can tie cut out so 
exactly, that ttiey will fit without any

Chocolate /cm (Civiiiib).— Take any 
quantity of chocolate, melt it over the 
pre in a small pan ; when ifielted pour 
it into that In which you are to make your 
cream ; break your yolks of eggs into it, 
(four eggs to every pint of cream) add 
some pounded loaf sugar to it, keep stir- 
ring continually; then add your cream 
by little and little, stirring and turning 
it till the whole is mixed properly 
together; then set your pan over the 
fire, and keep stirring with a wooden- 
spoon till you see your composition is 
near boiling, then take it oft' immedi- 
ately, for, from the moment you set your 
composition over the fire till that it 
offers to boil, it has sufficient time to in- 
corporate well and thicken sufficiently, 
without need of l>oiling ; and should you 
let it boil, you would risk the turning 
your cream into whey, on account of the 
yolks of eggs, which would do too much. 
Take great care likewise your cream 
is fresh and sweet, for otherwise as Koon 
as it is w^rm it will turn to curds and 
whey ; therefore, be careful, stir it con- 
tinually, from the time you set it on the 
fire till you take it oft; then put it in 
the sabotiere to make itcongeal after the 
usual manner* 

Chocoijite Cream /c«.— Dissolve the 
chocolate in a little water on a slow tire ;

and about half a pound of sugar. 

Chocolate lett {H'ater),-^Take three 
ounces of chocolate, warm it, and mix 
with it half a gill of syrup, and half a

Chocolate iV/irnrf/ow*.*— Put a quar- 
ter of a pound of chocolate on a tin-plate 
over a coal fire, and when it is dissolved 
pour it on a plate ; put to it a spoonful 
or two of sweet almond pa^te, made as 
for macaroons, stir it in well, and then 
pour it upon the remaind«>r of the almond 
paste, in which you have mixed a tea- 
spoonful of powdered cinnamon or va-

the yolks of six eggs. Boil add drain 
the tail of a salted eod^ take out all the 
meat, but leare in the bone; cut the 
meat to pieces ; put into a stewpan a 

Eiece of butter, some mushrooms cut in 
its, parsley, scallions, BchaIot8,and gar- 
lic, all minced ; do it up over the tire, 
then add a spoonful of flour, a little milk, 
and coarse pepper. Boil tnis until very 
thick, when the fish should be put in 
with the yolks of three eggs : keep it on 
the fire a little while, but do not let it 
boil, and then set it to cool. Put the 
tail bone on the table-dish, wrap the end 
in a buttered paper, surround the bone 
vitb part of the first mentioned mixture, 
then put in the ragoftt, cover it with the 
•remainder of the farce, and form the 
whole into the shape of the cod's tail, 
brush it over with egg, cover it with 
bread crumbs, and bake it. When done, 
clean the edges of the dish, and put into 
it some sauce made with a glass of stock, 
a bit of butter worked with flour, a 
spoonful of veijuice, salt, and pepper; 
thicken it over the fire. 

CODLINGS, OnV/^ef.— Take three 
fresh codlings, egg them over, shake 
them in flour, and oroil them over a mo* 
derate fire, till when done and of a good 
colour on both sides, or you may toss 
them in egg and crumbs of bread, as di- 
rected for turbot. Serve them with sauce 
^ rEtpagnole. 

Codlings with Sweet Herbi.'-Cui a 
codling into six or eight pieces, bone it 
as clean as possible, and marinate it in 
melted butter, lemon juice, and all sorts 
of sweet herbs chopped ; then lay it on 
theUble-dish with all the marinade,both 
under and over it ; cover it with bread- 
crumbs, and add small bits of butter, or 
a few drops melted, close to each other ; 
bake it in the oven ; it will require but a 
•hort time baking. 

CoDLiKos, pickled Hke Mangoes.'^ 
Make a brine of water and salt, strong 
enough to bear an egg : take codlinn full 
grown, but not ripe; let them lie in the 
brine for ten days, shifting the pickle 
once in two days ; then dry them, and 
scoop out the cores, take out the stalks 
ao Uiat yon may put them in again in the 
room of the core ; fill them with ginger, 
sliced very thin, a clove of ^riiclr, and 
whole mustard seeds. Pat in the piece 
of apple that belongs to the stalk, and 
tie It up tight; put to them as much 
white wine vinegar, with doves of gar- 
lic, whole mustaitl seed, and sliced 
r'"ger as will cover them: pour this 
■^'^ -ipon them boiling hot every other 
a fortnight or three weeks, and 
r^iiem in stone jars. This will imi- 



tate the real mangoe better than en- 
cumber. 

CoDLiira Tor^— Scald some codlings^leC 
them stand an hour in the same watetf 
covered, which will make tltem look 
green, then put them into your tart| 
either whole or quartered, put in sugar* 
and a little musk, close them up, ami 
let it iMike ; boil a quart of cream with 
the yolks of four or five eggs, sugar, and 
a little musk ; when your tart is half 
baked, cut it open, and pour your creamt 
&c. on the codlings; set it in the ovea 
again for half an hour, then scrape aooM 
sugar over it, and serve it up hot. 

COFFEE.*— The coffee-pot should b« 
three parts full of boiling water; the 
coffee IS to be added a spoonful at a tim6k 
and well stirred between each ; then boil 
gently, still stirring to prevent tba mix* 
ture from boiling over as the coflho 
swells, and to force it into combination 
with the water, this will be effected in 
a few minutes, after which, the moet 
gentle boiling must be kept up duriiig 
an hour. The coffee must then %a rt« 
moved from the fire to settle, one or two 
spoonsful of cold water thrown in assists 
the clarification, and precipitates tkie 
grounds. In about an hour, or as soon 
as the lifjuor has become clear, it is to bo 
poured into another vessel, taking care 
not to disturb the sediment. 

Coffee made in this manner will be of 
the finest flavour, and may be kept three 
days in summer, and Tour or five in win* 
ter; when ordered for use, it only re* 
quiresheating in the coffee-pot, and may 
be served up at two minutes' notice. 

The ^unUs or sediment which re* 
nuun, will make a second quantity of 
coffee, by boiling with fresh water for an 
hour; this is frequently used by servmola 
As this process requires some time, ao4 
a little attention, it is frequently the 
custom for the cook to make it m the 
evening, when the hurried work of the 
day is over. * 

COPPBE {French Method ef prepmHni 
it).* — 1st. Let your coffee be dry, not in 
the least mouldy or damaged. 

2d. Divide the quantity that is to bO 
roasted into two parts, 

3d, Roast the first part in a ooibe^ 
roaster, the handle of which MfK ke 
kept constantly turning until thjBiiflini 
becomes the colour of dried alanpidi or 
bread-raspings, and has lost on tf io lg htli 
of its weight. 

4th. Roast the second part nntl) It as* 
sumes the fine brown colour of chesonta, 
and has lost one- fifth of its weight. 

6th. Mix the two parts together, and 
grind them in a coffee-mill.

well tUl you see it mftkes a royal paste, a 
little thickish, that you may take it upon 
a knife ; then take Haifa sheet of paper, 
and cover it with little round and flat 
drops, which we call patiilt^ of the size 
of a farthing ; place it in the store with a 
alow fire till it is quite dry, and take it 
oir from the paper. 

Von may mske them another way, viz. 
with ground coffee, whicli you sift very 
iioe through a eieve, then adding a little 
water, to briag it to the proper degree 
ofiiquidity. the same as the above. 

Coffee (to Roatt),* —Coffee should 
never be roosted but at the precise time 
of its being used, and then it should be 
watched with the greatest care, and made 
of a gold colour rather than a brown one ; 
above all, take care not to bum it, for a 
very few grains burnt will be sufficient 
to communicate a bitter and rancid taste 
to several pounds of coffee. It is the 
l>e&t wav to roast it in a roaster, (over a 
cliarcoal fire), which turns with the hand, 
aa by that means it is not forgot, which 
often is the case when on a spit before 
tlie fire. 

Coffee 5M^r.*— Put a cup of strong 
coflee into a preserving-pan, and ad<1 to 
it a sufficient quantity of powder «ugar 
to make it thick, put it on a moderate 
fire, stirring it constantly ; the moment 
it begins to bubble, take it off, and add 
two spoonstul of powder sugar ; stir it 
with a silver spoon, scraping the sugar 
from the sides of the pan. A« it cooIh it 
will thicken and become darker ; dry it 
in a stove, and then pass it through a fine 
sieve. 

CoFFEn (»Syn/^).*— Take two pounds 
of ground collide, infuse one of the pounds 
of coffee in two pints of water, then let 
it stand to settle, when clear, pour it off; 
then with this liquor infuse the other 
ponnd of coffee; boil half a |Kiund of 
sugar to caramel height, colour it a deep 
red ; tlion put it into the coffee to dif- 
solve; then pour U into a pipkin with 
another half pound of sugar; carefully 
cluse the lid of the pipkin, and let it sim- 
mer for eight or nine hours ; then strain 
ft, and when cold, put it into bottles, cork 
them hermetically, and keep them in a 
cool place. 

When it is wanted for use, put some of 
the syrup into a cup, adding warm water 
acrordiiig to the strength you wish to 
drink your cofloc. 

The syrup of cofllee is most useful in 
travelling, when tliere is not time or 
coovmiencos for nmking codec in the 
lunal manner. 

CorrFK T/ir/.— Mix a little floor snd 
'!min, with one or two cups of good 
ileir coflee, a bit oi sugar, and three 



eggs; boil it about half an hour, stlrrinv 
continually, for fear it should catch M 
bottom ; put it into the paste, and whilet 
of eggs Deat up and frothed upon it I 
witliout ton-crust. 

Coffee ff^qfers.—To a common takto- > 
spoonful of ground rofiee, put a qwurtir > 
of a pound of sugar oowder, and a qou^ i 
ter of a pound of nne flour ; mix thea i 
well together, with as much good creaio« f 
as will make the paste or batter pour out 
pretty thick from the spoon ; the pMlg 
being prepared, warm the wafer IroA 
on both sides, and rub it over with soae 
butter, tied in a linen bag, or a bit of 
virgin wax: pour a spoonful of theba^ 
ter, and bake over a smart fire, tumiDi 
the iron once or twice, until the waller Is 
done on both sides of a fine brown 
colour; if you would have them twlatei. 
put them upon a mould, ready at band 
for that purpose ; nut it up direct] v, ■• 
you take it out, and press it to the ampe 
of wliatcver form you please, and to con- 
tinue; alwa^'s keep tliem in n warm 
place. 

Coffee (whipped).— Upon three hatf 
pints of cream, put two cups of stmnf 
coffee cleared : add four yolks of new-laiil 
eggs beat up, half a pound of sugar, and 
about as much more cream. 

Coffee d I'eau.Cream au bain marie,* 
— Infuse a quarter of a pound of ground 
coffee in a glass of Imlling water, let it 
stand, and when the eoffee is settled« 
pour off the liquor into a preserving pan, 
in which is a quarter of a pound of sugar 
boiled to caramel ; cover this cloaeiyi 
and dissolve the sugar over hot asliM.

CYDER.— Cyder is a fruit liquor pre-

pared by means of fermentation, from 
the exprfMed juice of diiferent sorts of 
applet. Tlie prooen by which this liquor 
is formed has much similarity in sli the 
diiferent di»tricta, although there is 
much diversity in regard to the care and 
management which are bestowed upon it. 

The vsrietiesof apples which are grown 
and cultivated in the different fruit dis- 
tricts of the kingdom for this intention, 
are extremely numerous; the following 
is a list of the most approv ed :-~ 

Siyre. 

Coccagee. 

Golden Hsrvey. 

Red Streak. 

Golden Pippin. 

Queening. 

Cowsnne Red. 

There have been several varieties of 
apples introducHl from Normandy, and 
arc thence called Red Nnrman, Yrllow 
Norman, &c. Mr. Knight's new kinds 
are also highly esteemed for cyder; 
namely. 

TbeDownton Pippin. 

I'he Grange Apple. 

TIte Foxley, and 

The Breugewood Pippin. 

Gathering the Fruit. — Great care 
should he taken that it is sufliciently 
ripe before it is removed from the treer, 
otherwise the cyder will be liarKh, rough, 
and unpleasant in its taste. It should 
be gathered on a dr^* day, when the fruit 
has acquired such a state of maturity at« 
to be rcsdy to drop from tlio tree, when 
the limliH or branches of it rhould 
be slightly shaken, and dinburthencd 
in a partial manner of its apples, thus 
taking only such as are in a npe state, 
leaving the others to acquire a due de- 
aree of maturity. It is indeed thought 
best to make three ^atltrrinvs of tlie 
crop, keeping each by itself. The latter 
Katuering^, as well as the wind-falls, 
can^ however, only be employed in mak- 
ing inferior cyder ; the prime cyder must 
be drawn from the first gatherings which 
have been msde. 

The merit of cyder will always depend 
much on the proper mixture, or rather 
on the proper separation of the fruits. 
Each kind should be collected separately 
and kept till it becomes perfectly mel- 
low; for this purpose, in the common 
practice of the country, they are placi'd 
in heap^ of ten inches kfV a foot thick, and 
exposed to the sun and air nnd rain ; not 
bemg over covered, except in very se- 
vere frosts. The Ptreniith and flavour of 
the future liquor in however inci eased by 
keeping the fruit under cover some time 
befm It is ground ; but unles* a aitoa* 
tlin can be aflbrded itj in which it ii ex- 



posed to a free cut rent of air, and 
it can be spread very thin, it is i 
contract an unpleasant smell, whi< 
much allect the cyder produced fi 
No criterion appears to be knoi 
which the most proper point of nu 
in the fruit may be a^ceitainrd w 
curacy ; but there is good reason 
lieve that it improves as long aa 
tinues to acouire a derner shade i 
low. Euch iienp should be exa 
prior to its being giound, and m 
cayed or gieen fruit carefully 
away. 

When the fruit of different soil 
qualities has been kept separate 
one another a few weeks, it will fa 
ceived that foaie of the prime cm 
in a pioper state of mnturstion ; th 
pulp has acquired its highrst de| 
rictjness ; the kernels assumed 
browntHt colour; the rind still fie 
any appearance of mttenness ; au 
they cHiiily yield lo tht pressure i 
thumb : then is the time, and si 
the fruit to be employed in making 
cyder. Every necesKary utensil i 
now be got in readincst ; the mill, 
tubs, casks, psils, aiid bowia, 
washed, and suflered to dry tlion 
before they are employed in the 
ne!«t5. 

Grint/ififf the yippfes. — In the ba 
of grinding the Iruit, for this uw 
what is termed pommage, several > 
ent methodimre practised. It ha 
sug^stod by sumo that esch sort ui 
should be ground beparately, or,at 
such sortr^ in niixtuio. as become i 
the same lime; but ethers s rate thi 

Srartice is that by which '• liiie cyt 
iflfer^nt flavour^and degrees of »tr 
is obtained from the same orcliii 
liqui rs being mixed after the 
made." It is*, however, allowed 
"in all common cases,'* the praci 
grinding diflf'rent varieties of 
equally ripe together, is found eli 
as it is le.tri diliicult to find the rec 
degrees of richne^s^ astrin«;enq

And hence it is supposed, tliat <

Buorin tliii* btate, hhewn the place 
.ich it stands i<i toi> warm, and air 
be admitted. This i^ the critical 
■ntlor racking the iiiiuor, which is 
by drawinff off the mwo part into 
veaseln, which miint lie placed in a 
oool aitaation for a day or two, after 
I it may again be bisrrelled, and 



placed in some moderately cool siiua* 
tion for the winter. In racking^ it is 
sdvlsahle tiiatthe atream fivm therack- 
iiifc cock be small, and that the receiving 
tub l)e but a»mall depth below the cock ; 
lest, by exciting a violent motion of the 
paitsof Uie liquor, another fermentation 
l>e brought up. The casks into which 
the iiouor \* put, whenever racked otl', 
should aWays b<* previously thuruughlv 
scalded, and dried again ; and each 
should want cevcral gal Ions of being full, 
to expose a larger surface to the air. 
Having attended to tiiefie rules so fai, 
the cyder wiil reouire very little further 
attention, beyond filling up the \'efsels 
every two or three weeks to supply the 
waste by the iniiensible fermentation, 
until the beginning of the succeeding 
March ; at which time, it may be reawn- 
ably expected, the cyder will be bright, 
pure, and ia a fit state kir its finnl rack- 
mg. ThiShhould be done in lair weather; 
hut should the cyder not prove ai bright 
and as good a colour as dcbired, this is 
the lime for applying some innocent re- 
m(>dy ; the be^t method Ia by putting two 
pounds of lump migar into a liognhead of 
cydrr. If >ou wi»h the cydt*r tt Vtt of a 
higher colour than what the fruit gives 
it, melt a pound of lunip>tu|rar in a stew- 
pan, over a clear fin*, «tirnng it fre- 
quently, until it comes to a v(*ry dark 
bi-own colour ; then take it ofT the fire, 
andfSsit cool !<. add aome c^'der thereto, 
by little and little, conii:iuing totitir it 
till it becomes a thin uniform fluid. 
About a pint oi this colouring to a hogs* 
head of cyder, is sufficient. 

Soon after the i^pring racking, the 
caska may be gradually stnppt-d, by 
first laying the cork on the hung-hole, 
and in the courhe of a few day a, forcing 
it very tightly into it, covering it over 
with melted resin, or any other similar 
tiu Instance. 

Boitiiuti the ryiler.—'T\i\% should be

DISTILLING.* — Dij^tillation 
procefK of exiraciing the spiritnoi 
aromatic particles, from varioos 
stances and liquids in which the 
envelope<l, and irkewisp sepaiating 
from earthy and i^aline particleSi 
which they arc mixed. This pro* 
performed by menus of heat ; an 
vtipour-bat/u water-hath^ and tand' 
nre the three methods usually 
tised. 

The \'apour-balh produces the 
moderate degree of heat neceKsai 
distilling. A melal, or earthen 1 
fillfd to al)out tH-o-th rds with wal 
set on a furnace, over this \a plan 
alemliic^ containing the sulmtMnce 
distilled ; as soon as the water I)cnIi 
vapour Hkos, and striking the bon 
tlie alembic commuuicate-* its heat I 
to, which forces the volatile or II 
parts of its contents to ri^e, and sej 
themselves from the grosser ones. 

The water-lnth is more cnmi 
made urte of thsin the above, bein 
difficult to niauHge ; and in nii^l 
idnnts or flowers, i\hich are liafa 
hurn,t'r are heavy, and require II

The water-bath difl'ers from th 
pour- bath in this respect, that thei

hie k Hnmereed in the water, which 
intluitly rommunicates the degree of 
hvt it nceives. 

Tbe Sand-bnth is resorted to when 
m very itronK degree of heat Is neceH- 
nry : a vcaael filled with sand is placed 
on ibe fire, and the alembic completely 
bwied in it ; this last proceM, however, 
veguirei the utmost prrcaution. 

Olu*, or earthen vessels, are pre- 
ienble in distilling waters ; but if they 
■R not sufficiently large to contain the 
vlwie of the liquid, copper ones, if well 
liaiied, may be employed instead. 
Earthen vessels should be perfectly 
kiM. free from blemish, and previously 
proved* 

Great care is necessary that the fire 
be BoC too fierce at tlie commencement 
tf tbe operation, a^ the vessels employed 
■R liable to break when exposed sud- 
dnly to a atrong heat; the fire should 
thfiifni r be increased gradually. 

Obaerve, that when a substance re- 
aires repeated distillation, the fire 
■BBald be increased fur each operation. 

Alio observe : that the distilled liquid 
ought to flow from the alembic in one 
CDOliBued, thongh small stream ; if it 
MBe by drops only, the liquor obtained 
wUI be but slightly impregnated with the 
W PcnU al oil. 

The first drops which flow from the 
alembic are called phlegm, and should 
■MX be mixed with the distilled liquid ; 
U k therefore better to place a fniall 
i^ass under the moiith of tlie alembic ; 
when nearly half filled, remove it, and 
pat the vefisel in nhich the distilled 
■ubstance is to je received. 

Tbe various vessels used in distilling 
ODaht to be very closely cemented to- 
fCttier; the material for thi» purpose \» 
CiUed /«/e; and is also used to put over 
dbc corks uf the bottles containing spi- 
litnous liquors. 

The be»t /ute is made with linseed oil, 
a amall quantity of litharge, to give it 
di yn ci * ^ and very dry clay reduced to 
fowder ; by beating these ingredients wel I 
ma mortar, a thick paste is produced, 
iribicfa is easily sproa<] over the ed^es of 
the f ti wels, and eflbctually excludes the 
air. This paste will continue moist 
doctile for a long time. 

Anoclier hue is coriipt)Hi*d of clay, sand, 
row-lif ir, or hemp ; this in izenerally 

_ to put over nuch veft^elrtasnre liable 

crack* or melt, on being expoaed to 
wry strong heat. 

£mhim Sapteuti<e is made of slacked 
BBir« flour, and clay, finely pulverised 
and sifted ; liuund together with whites 
if Cfgs, beaten up with water. 

Aa bttt method of excluding the air 



from bottles, is, by dipping the corks in 
a mixture of while wax and beef-suet, in 
the proportion of two- thirds of the for- 
mer to one-third of the latter ; and then, 
when the corks are well driven into the 
bottles, to cover them with tlie first- 
mentioned lute. 

DOTTRKKI^. - They arc to be 
roHsted the same as Ortolans. 

DOVES.— The turtle-dove is distin- 
guished by a blueish ring round its neck, 
the other parts being almost white. The 
stock-dove-exceeds both the wood-pigeon 
and ring'dove in size. When they are 
fresh and fat, they are limber- footecf, and 
feel full in the vent; but when stale, 
their ventn are green and flabby. 

DllAGEES ( Common),*— Vhc paste 
for thefie drageet is made in the same 
manner as for the better sort, but tlie 
mateiials difler a little : thus to a quar- 
ter of a pound of the gum, take eitlier 
equal quantities of sugar and powder, 
or one-third of the former to two-thirds 
of the latter. When these and the gum 
are vreli mixed, mil out the paste until 
it is as thin as the back of a knife* blade ; 
then take a paste-cutter, shaped like a 
suttar-Icaf, with the top taken ofl*, with 
the largeHt end of which, cut as many 
pieces of the paste as will about two- 
thirds fill the cutter; press these through 
the smaller end into paper cases; set 
them in a warm plaee for several days. 
Those kind of dragees may, if liked, tie 
sugared in the same manner as almonds. 

Dragers en PantiUagc* — These dra- 
geet are made of the same materials as 
the superfine drageet; the only difler- 
enre consists in tlieir forms, which 
resemble the honlMit : to make them, 
it is necessary to have a number of 
wooden moulds, (pear-tree wood is the 
best), on which must be stamped small 
t<quHres, with various devices cnRravedon 
them. Cut your paste into flmall pieces ; 
press each piece on a mould ; take ofl' all 
the sui>er-aDundant paste ; then dip your 
finger in water, ana with it remove the 
paste from the mould ; dry them in cases 
like the other dragres, 

Dragees, Snperjinet* — Put a quarter 
of a pound of the l>est gum-dragon into a 
pan, with a pint of cold water, cover, and 
let It stand for twenty- four hours; then 
take a strong close clotli, about two feet 
long, and put a part of your gum into it ; 
fold it thn-e limes, so as to envelop the 
gum; then wring the cloth, by v^hich 
means the purest gum will be forced 
thnmgh; scrape it oft' carefully with a 
knife, and then proceed in the same way. 
until all the gum lie strained ; put it inU) 
a marble mortar, and stir it about with a 
pestlf" for half an hour: Uien add to it a

them in your hands to smooth them, ami 
make them all c|uite small ; to those 
which imitate fruits, add tails and toptt, 
cut from cherry-stalks, and stuck on 
whilst the paste is damp ; and with a hair- 
pencil, dipped in powdered cinnabar, 
tinge the pears, apples, and apricots, 
slightly breathing on them to moisten 
the surfnce. When all are done, put 
them into paper cases, and si't tli^ni in

drain and press them, chop them tine, 
add melted butter, and serve up the 
sauce imme diaiely, for if the herbs are 
mixed any lenath of time before it ia 
served up to table they will be disco- 
loured. Parsley becomes equally dis- 
coloured from the same cause. 

If approved, there may be added the 
pulp of green goosel)erries rubbed 
through a hair sieve, and a little sifted 
sugar.

herb sutliciently ; add what sugar you 
think proper, and keep it in a cool place 
a good while before using; the same is 
done with any other kmd of herb, and 
in general with all sorts of fruit used in 
confectionary; also with the syrups of 
liquid preserves, mixing some of the 
liquor with water and sugar, sutlinent 
to make it palatable. You may either 
ice it or not, according as you think 
proper. 

FIELDFARES, Roasted. — When

FORCKMEAT UnqvPfUentsJor),-^ 
Forcemeat should be made pufliciently 
consistent to cut with a knife, but not 
dry or heavy. No one flavour Khould 
predominate greatly; according to what 
It is wanted for, a selection may l»e made 
from the following list* being careful to 
use the least of those articles which are 
the most pungent : 

Cold fowl, or veal, scraped ham, fat 
bacon, beef suet, crumbs of bread, pai- 
sley, white pepper, salt, nutmeg, 
yolks and whites of eggs, well beaten, to 
bind the mixture. 

The forcemeat may be made •'ith any 
of these articles without any striking fla- 
vour ; therefore any of the following dif- 
ferent ingredients may be made use of to 
vary the taste. 

Oysters, anchovies, tarragon, savory, 
penny- royal, knotted-marjorani, thyme, 
nafil, yolks of hard eggs, Cayenne gar- 
lick, shalots, chives, Jamaica pepper, in 
fine powder, or two or three cluves.

Kk, aauaage meat. It is witli this stuf-

FOWLS, pirectiofu for choosing and 
(/re»f//^.~When a cock is young, hus 
spurs are short ; take care that you are 
not deceived by tlieir having been cut or 
pared, a trick that is often practised. If 
fresh their vent will l»e close and dark. 
Hens are be^t, juRt Ix^fore they begin \iu 
Isy, and yet are full of egg ; if they are 
old, their combs and letrs are rough. 

Ail poultry should be very carefully 

Cickfd, every plug removed, and the 
air nicely singed with p:iper. 

The cv>ok slvpuld \tc citrefiil in drawing 
poultry of all sorts, not to break the gali- 
bag, for no W2Uihing will take off the bit- 
ter where it has touched. 

If for roasting, black-legged fowls are 
the most moist. A good-sized towl will 
take from three quartern of an hour lo 
an hour in ruisting, a middling-ai/ed one 
about halt art hour, and a very small one, 
orchirken, twenty minuteH. 

Tame fowls reouire more roasting, and 
are longer in heating through tliau 
others. All bort!>( $»hon]d be continually 
ba*^ted, that they may be nerved with 
a froth, and appear of a fine colour. 
The fire must be very quirk and clevr 
before any fowls are put down. Serve 
with eggHatice, bread sHuce, or garnibhtd 
with sausages or sealded parsley. 

A laiye bHrn-door fowl, well hung, 
should be stuHed in tlie crop with mu- 
SRge-meat, and served with gravy in the 
dit«h, and with bread sauce. 

The liead nhould be turned under the

in some well skimmed clear mutton 
broth, and seasoned with onion, mace, 
pepper, and salt. Abimi IihU an hour 
before it is ready, put in a quarter of a 

§int of rice well washed and soaked. 
Immer till tender; then strain it from 
the broth, and put the rice* on a sieve

duce into the slits you have made, and 
send it to table with a brown ponraJt 
highly seasoned, and very hot. 

Fowl, fkipihiade o/.*— Take the la- 
mains of a ready dressed fowl, and pot 
them into a stewpan ; then do up some

IbwI is preserved better by not siiifflnir 
tken; put into each, pepper, salt, and a 
bit of butter. 

Wild fowl do not require so much

of a fine colour, and niroly frothed. A 
rich brown gravy should be served in 
the dish, and when the breast is cut into 
■Ucesi before it is taken from the bone, 



It will be much improved by a squeece 
of lemon, some salt and pepper. 

If you wish to uke off the fishy smell 
which these birds frequently have, put 
an onion, salt, and hot water into the 
dripping pan, and for the first ten mi- 
nutes baste them with this; then re- 
move the pan, and keep constantly Iwst- 
ing with lia'ter.

lard, and put them into a saucepan, with 
a slice of veal, a little streaked bacon, 
and sweet herbs ; when suflScientl v done, 
lay them in a di^h on any vegetable you 

Cleave (previously boiling them in good 
roth), and serve them as a side dish. 

There are various other ways of send- 
ing the wings of fowl to table ; but they 
are generally cooked as at»ve, or accord- 
ing to the taste and fancy ; only two or 
three recipes arc, therefore, introduced 
here. 

Fowls {fHngsqf) an pain de heurre.* 
— Boil the wings in broth, with some 
onions, a bay- leaf, salt and pepper, when 
done and quite cold, wrap each wing In 
a large slice of butter, which must be 
pretty firm ; if it sitouid l»e soft, work a 
proper quantity of flour into it, to hring 
It to the right consistence ; when all the 
wings are covered, lay one over the 
other, i)res8 the whole together lightly, 
so that it only fnrms one piece ; then dip 
your hands in flour, that in smoothing 
this piece the butter may not adhere to 
them ; then set it in a cool place for half 
an honr. In the meanwhile nrepare a 
quantity of brcad-crumbs well dried in 
the oven, and having fastened the but- 
tered wings to a spit, put them before a 
slow fire, take a handful of thft bread- 
crumbs, and when the hotter begins to 
melt, shake them over it, and continue 
thi« operation till the butter ha8 taken 
nn all the crumbs, and no longer runs, 
wiien it may be put nearer the fire to 
finif h the cooking ; take care to keep tlie 
whole of a clear eq^iial brown. 

Fowl ( fFingt i(f)d la Provengale,^ — 
Lard the wingA with small pieces of an- 
chr.vie^, iuKtead of baron, and cook them 
in n closely oivered saucepan, with some 
streaky bacon, artichoke bottoms, ai>pa» 
ragus tops, and garlic, a sufhdcnt quan- 
tity of un>th, and seasoned with salt, 
nutmeg, ginger and pepper. Wlicn ouita

in A d\*h ; add r little veal gravy to the 
liquor, reduce it to the proper contif- 
tencft, and pour it very hot over the 
win^. The garlic, ginger, and pepper 
may be omitted at pleasure. 

Fowl (f flings tf) en Redingqte,^-^ 
Take the number of wings you intend 
to use, and having trimmed, wrap each 
in a thin ulice of bacon, taking care that 
the whole of the wing is covered; tic 
tiiem round, and put them into a sauce- 
pan, with some broth, parsley, a bay-leaf, 
aalt, and pepper. When done, take 
them out and let them drain ; then cover 
them widi bread-crumbs, and broil them 
ovpr a clear slow fire ; take oflfthe strings, 
dish, and serve them with any sauce you

aix sweet put one bitter), bruise them, 
and some macaroons, and when reduced 
to powder, mix them with a little crisped 
orange-flower (alno in powder), and a 
tuflicient quantity of powder-sugar to 
sweet«*n it ; add these to the above pre- 
parat'on, and stir them in well with a 
wooden spoon. If your frangipane \rt too 
thick, add another egg or two. and then 
make whatever use of it you may de* 
airp. 

You may, if you think proper, sulisti- 
tute piatnchioH for the sweet almonds, in 
which cav a little spinach eRsence must 
be added to colour it^ the macaroons 
and orange-flowers omitted, and three 
bitter alirionds only used.

half a pound of leg of veal, a pound of fnt 
bacon, and half a pound of ham, all ready 
dressed, and mince them as small as pos- 
sible ; mix with these an ounce of spiced 
•alt, the yolks of two eggs, and two des- 
sert spoonsful of sweet herbs, the same 
quantity of truffles, all blanched and 
•bred small ; when well mixed together, 
put this farce into a basin ; then take a 
pound and a half of truffles, pare, and cut 
each truffle in four ; choose a fine red 
call's tongue, take off the skin, cut 
it lengtliwlse into six strips : cut in the 
same manner a pound oi raw ham, or 
fresh pork fat, raw. 

Pick, singe, and bone, a good sized fowl, 
lay it open on a napkin, cut away half the 
meat oi the breast and legs, and put the 
pieces on those parts where the skin is 
most exposed, so that the whole may be 
the tame thickness ; strew over it spiced 
salt, in the proportion of four drachms 
to a pound; spread over tlie whole half 
the farce prepared above, on that half the 
truffles, then the tongue and h.'im fat, 
taking care to vary the colour : season 
tliem liMhlly with the spiced salt; tben 
lay half what remains of the farce, and 
on that the truffles* tongue, and ham, as 
before; cover the whole of these with 
the remainder of the farce, and roll it 
up either as a ball or an egg ; sew up 
the skin so that none of the stuffing may 
escar*e ; and wrap it first in slices of 
bacon, and then in a fine cloth ; tie the 
ends of the latter very tight; and that 
the form may be properly preserved, tie 
three stiings round the uody, but not 
tightly. Take a saucepan, line it with 
bacon, put in the galantine^ put round It 
foor onions, four carrots, a bunch of pars- 
ley and scallions. thyme, basil, bay leaf, 
four cloves, the ixMies of the fowl, two 
knuckles of veal, or two calf's feet, a suf- 
ficient quantity of stock or fowl consomme^ 
to cover the galaniine^ a glass of Madeira 
wine, and two dessert spoonsful of old 
brandy. Cover the wliole of this with a 
piece of buttered paper, the exact shape 
and size of the saucepan, and set it on a 
fierce fire for a short time, after which let 
it simmer gently for three hours, then re- 



move it, and when it has stood for an 
liour, take out the galantine carefully^ 
and place it breast oownwards on a deep 
dish, and squeeze it a little, press onl 
what moisture it may contain, putflk 
saucepan lid on it, on which place elgkl 
or ten pounds weight, to make the fote^ 
tine rather wide than high. Strain tb» 
jelly through a silk sieve, (put aside the 
gross parts,) and let it stand a Quarter of 
an hour, then draw it off, and clarify iU 

The galantine being quite cold, tate 
away the cloth and bacon, trim it a litlk 
if necessary, and glsze it completely. 
Place it on a dish, and garnish it with tot 
jelly, according to your fancy. 

All sorts of galantines whether of 
chickens, turkies, partridges, or asy 
other kind of game or poultry, are dent 
in this manner.

plunge them into it one by one, drawing

are completely drained, well salt and 
pepper the insides, and thoroughly 
tlicm before roasting. 

The most delicate birds, even gr 
may be preserved by these means ; then 
birds that live by suction cannot be dona 
in this manner, as they are never diawBt 
and it might so happen that the beat 
would make them worse, as the^wattr 
could not pass through them.

care to filter the 6ret drops twice, as they 
generally carry with them 8ome portion 
of the coal.

coal, and other materials, may be separat- 
ed as follows: pour boiling water on 
them until they no longer retain any 
sweetness ; then put these different 
waters together, set them over a large 
fire to asraporate, till the syrup only re- 
mains. Tnis syrup contracts tne flavour

ounces of the best and clearest sort of 
isinglass for a quart mould of jelly, put it 
into a stewpan, with just sufficient quan- 
tity of cold water to completely cover it ; 
set it by tlie stove, with a si>oon in it, to 
stir it at times, and skim it when any 
•cum rises ; let it boil very gently, and 
well reduce, only be careful not to re- 
duce it too much, as it will bum, and, of 
course, get a bad taste, and spoil your 
jelly; when vou think it is sufficiently 
reduced, and looks clear, pass it through 
a sieve into a ba^on, ready for use. 

IsiNGLAfft, to Clarify,* — Take an ounce 
and quarter of the blest isinglaFs, cut it 
into small pieces, and wasli them siJVeral 
times in warm water. Put the iningiass 
into a preserving pan, with fiv6 glasses of 
filtered water, set It on the fire, and, as 
soon as it boils, place it at the side of the 
stove, so as to Keep up the boiling; take 
off the scum directly it rises; and when 
tlie whole is reduced to three anarters, 
strain it through a cloth Into a basin for 
use. 

Some add, in clarifying ininglaw, 
lemon- peel, to remove Its disagreeable 
taste; but as good isinglass ought to 
have no flavour, and as the lemon-peel 
is certain to give a yellow tinge to thati 
it Is much better left out. 

Isinglass F/afmmery.— Pot six ounces 
of isinglav into a quart of new milk, 
iweeien it, set it over the fire, and keep 
it stirring one way all the time, till it is 
jellied; pour it into basins, and when 
cold turn it out ; you may put in orange 
flower water if you like.

Isinglafts, a quarter of an ounce of cloves, 
and a quart of water ; boil it till reduced 
to a pint, then strain It over some sugar.

■poonful of shred parsley* half a spoonful 
of shalot^, the same of mushrooms (both 
minced small), half a bottle of white wine, 
and an ounce of butter; boil tliese till no 
moisture remains, then put in twoladles- 
fal of vekmte. and one of conMommiy set 
It to boil, taking care to skim off all the 
fat ; when yon find It about the consis- 
tence of clear broth, take it from the fire. 



put it into another vessel* and keepitliot 
m the bain nuaie. 

Itauenne, tnVA TVufiet, — Chop some 
nice black truffles, sweat them in a little

sauce. They are not thought much of 
in England, hut are much esteemed In 
inland countries.

cook It in court- bouillon ; when donei 
and you pre ready to serve, take off the 
scales, and dish it for table, pouring over 
it any white sauce you thinV proper, \A

case, cut It into pieces, and put it In a 
stewpan, with a slice of butter, a bunch 
of sweet herbs, and some mushrooms | 
turn it a few times over the fire, and then 
shake in a little flour; moisten with good 
stock and white wine, and stew it over a 
brisk fire; when done, and agreeably 
seasoned, put in the yolks of tlu'ee eggs,

LAMB to CAoose.— The vein in the 
neck of a fore-<^uarter of lamb ought to be 
of a fine blue, it is then fresh ; irit is of a 

green or yellow cast, it is stale ; if in the 
ind-quarter, there is a faint disagreeable 
smell under the kidney, or if the knuckle 
is limp, it is not good : if the eyes ate 
sunk, the head Is not fresh ; grass lamb 
is in season in April or May, and con- 
tinues ffood till August House Lamb 
may be had in great towns generally a>l 
the year round, but is in its highest per- 
fection in December and January. 

Fore-quarter includes the etu)ulder, 
neck, and breKnt. 
Hind'Owxrter is the leg and loin. 
The Head', the pluck is generally rold 
with the head, which contains the liver, 
lights, heart, out, and melt. 

The Frv contains the sweetbreads 
lambstones, and »kirts, with some of the 
liver.

either a neck or loin of lamb, then cut it 
into steaks; boil half a pound of rice in 
water for ten minutes, and put to it a 
quart of good gravy, with some nutmeg, 
and two or three blades of mace ; slew it 
over a slow fire or stove till the rice be- 
gins to thicken ; then take it off, stir in a 
pound of butter, and when quite meli- 
ed, add the yolks of six eggs finely 
beaten ; butter a dish all over, put a little 
pepper and salt to the steaks, diip them in 
melted butter, and lay them in the but- 
tered dish; pour upt^n them the gra\y 
which comes from them, and then tl>c 
rice; pour over the yolks of three eggs 
finely beaten, send It to the oven, 
rather more than half an hour will be 
suflicient. to bake it. 

LasfB Blanquette q^.*— Roast a leg of 
lamb, and when cold take off all the 
! skin and nerves, and cut it into pieces. 
- all the same size and thicknet»s, cut off 
' the angles sn as to make them nearly 
round, beat them with the handle of a 
I knife, and put them into a saucepan, with 
' some fried mushrooms, four laolesfttl of 
I vehtit6 travaiifS^ and a little pepper ; set 
i the saucepan on the fire for a few minutes, 
I thicken it with the yolks of two eggn ;

moderately heated, nothing behif hmw 
liable to bum than dmonos and angari 
by the least negliaeoee in this resptct, 
the surfsce would be burned, wbikt the 
inside would remain ualiakrd. The best 
method to obviate any miacMef of Ibli

MARCHPANE.*— Tkke fmir pounds 
of sweet almonds, throw them into MU 
ing water, let them lay till the skin 
lonoens, tlien put them into cold water, 
after a lew minutes blanch and throw 
them again into cold water to wash them 
thoroughly. Wlien dry, pound them 
(a handful at a time) to a very fine paste, 
moistening each handful with two spoons- 
fhl of water ; the whole quAntity of al- 
monds being pounded, put the paste into 
a large p r es er v ing pan, with four pounds 
of the best lump sugar finely pounded 
and sifted; set tl>e pan on a coal fire, 
Htir and work them up together with a 
laife wooden spatula, rather sharp at the 
bottom : be very careful that none of the 
paste adheres to the pan ; the consequence 
of SQch neglect would be, that the march- 
pane would lie spotted with yellow, and 
would smell un pfeamntl v. Whilst work- 
■ttf It op. the paste, which when put In 
was tolerably firm, will become rather 
liquid, and a great deal of vapour may 
be observed ; the first is caused by tl»e 
engar dissolved by the heat and moisture, 
the seeond by the evaporation of the 
water. Continue to stir and work it up 
In this manner without ceasing for two 
hours, and if at the end of that time, you 
ean iMcfa the paste without its adhering 
lo yonr fingers. It is suffi Gently dried : 
hi which case remove it all to one side of 
the pan, clean tlie bottom and side of 
the other, sprinkle it well with flour, 
then put the paste to that part, clean and 
sprinkle that side al»o; then take the 
pan by tmth ears and move it round and 
imind, no that the pute may all unite 



I together : as soon as it has done so, put 
I it into a sheet of paper, or, if you want to 
use It immedfaitely, on a well floored 
table. This paste, if the almonds be 
well pounded and then thoroughly dried, 
will keep good for six months ; if these 
two precautions are not properly attend- 
ed to, it will become sour in ten days. 

MAacRPANB JtMtt/.*— Take a pound of 
sweet almonds, blanch and throw tliem 
into cold water, drain and pound them, 
moistening with omnge-flower and plain 
water, but take care not to put too much 
at once. The almonds being reduced to 
a paste, put them into a preserving pan 
with half a pound of powder suffsr, set 
the pan on a moderate fire to dry the 
patte, which will be sufficiently so if, wlien 
ybu touch it, it no longer sticlcs to your 
finger, then take it out and place it on a 
plate or wafer paper, previously sprinkled 
with sugar : as soon as it is cold cut it 
in pieces, which roll in your hand to the 
size of yonr little finger ; form them into 
rings, and lay them on iron gratings, 
glaze andjpat tiiem into a brisk oven to 
colour. Tne above paste may also be 
employed as follows : roll it out and cut 
it in half, spread over one piece apricot 
mamudade, or any otiier preserve you 
please, cover it with the other piece, cut 
It into lozenges, crescents, 8bc., accord- 
ing to your fancy, lav them on the grating 
as above, glaze and colour them in a 
quick oveiw

MUSHROOMSlocAooM.— Themush- 
rooms proper to be used in cookery grow 
in the open pasture land, for those that 
grow near or under trees, are poisonouf . 
The eatable moshrooms nrst appear very 
small, and of a round form, on a little 
stalk. They grow very rapidly, and the 
upper part and stalk are white. As they 
increase in size, the under part gradually 
opens, and shows a fringed fur of a very 
fine salmun-colour, which continues 
more or less till the mushroom has gained 
some size, and then turns to a dark 
brown. These marks should be attended 
to, and likewise whether the skin can 
be easilv parted from the edge and mid- 
dle, and whether they have a pleasant 
smell. Those which are poisonouH have 
a yellow skin, and the tinder part haa not 
the clear flern colonr of the real mush- 
room \ besides which, they smell rank 
and disagreeable, and the fur is white or 
yellow.

rooms for keeping sliould be of a modt- 
rate size ; lay them on hurdles, or atrlnff, 
and hang them up In a dry place, where

process, lay them in an oven; should 
you have any larm ones, take off the 
tops and stems, and cut theni ia sllees :

and keep them over a gentle fire till all 
of it be dried into them again, then put 
as much vinegar into the pan as will be

quarter of a pound of batter. Let it 
stew till the liquor ia dried op,' then lay 
them on sieves to dry, till they will beat 
to a powder. Bottle, and cork it down 
dose for use; a tea-spoonful added to 

frravy or soup, a minute or two before 
t is taken off the fire, gives a fine fla« 
vour. 

Mushroom Powder,—Atter the mush* 
rooms or champignons are dried whole, 
they may be set before the fird till criRp ; 
then grind and sift them through a fine 
sieve,and preserve insmall bottles closely 
corked. 

MusHaooMS^ Quintessence ^.— Tliis 
delicate relish is obtained, by sprinkling 
some button or flap mushrooms over with 
a little salt, and three hours after, nuwn 
them ; the following day, strain off the 
liquor that will flow from tliem, and boil 
it m a stewpan till reduced to half. It 
will not keep long, but many prefer it on 
account of the flavour of the mushrooms 
not being overpowered by the spices, 
which it is necessary to put into kctdiup 
to preserve them. 

MusnaooM Looom.— Waah some small 
button muslirooms, the same as for pick- 
ling, and boil them a few minutes ina little

A m be rgris is prepared in a similar

MUSTARD, to Afcite.— Take some of 
the best Durham flour of mustard and

with Imiling water, rtiblnng it extremely 
snsoeth \ add a little salt, and keep it in 
aamall jar closely covered, and only put 
aa miicb into the mustard-pot as will be

MoaTAan, lo Abite.*— Take a few

particular that it is mixed perfeoUy

TiuTTON (OUervatioM on).— The 
pipe tlmt rans along the bone of the in- 
sida of achtae of mutton ought tol)e 
takoB away; and if U ia to be leapt any 



length of time, the part cloae round the 
tail should be rubbed with salt, pre vkmsly 
catting out the kernel. 

It ia beat for the batcher to take out 
the kernel in the fkt on the thick part of 
the leg, aa that ia the part orost likely to 
become tainted. The chine and rib- 
bones shoukl be wiped every day ; and 
the bloody part of the neck be cut off. in 
order to preserve it. The brisket 
changes first in the breast ; therefore, if 
it ia to be kept, it is best, should the 
weather be hot, to rub it with a little 
aalt. 

When intended for roasting, it should 
hang as long as it will keep, the hind 
qoarter particularly ; bat not so long aa 
to becoBie tainted. 

Mutton Ibr boiling ought not to hang 
long, as it will prevent its looking of a 
goodcoloar. 

The greatest care should be taken to 
preaerve, by paper« the fit of what if 
roasted. 

MtrrroN, a Basque q^.— Put the caul of 
a leg of veal into a copper dish the size of 
a small puach- bowl . Cliop the lean part 
(tf a leg of mutton extremely small ; take 
half its weight of beef marrow, the crumb 
of a penny-loaf, the rind of haR a lemon, 
gnted, lialf a pint of red wine, two an- 
chovies, and the yolks of four eggs. Mix 
all together with the mutton, and fasten 
it in the caul in the middle of the disli ; 
Balce it in a quick oven, and when done, 
turn the dish upside down, and turn the 
whole out. Pour over it a brown gravy 
garnish with pickles, and serve with 
sweet sauce.

a quantity of which Imrdens the meat. 
Sogar ia quite as great a preservative.

you may find oonvsnient ; also mince hall 
a poundof beef suet, some ham, fkt bacon, 
trofflaa, ^stachio nuts, four or five yolki 
of hard eggs ; mix witli these all sorta 
of spices, sweet herbs, and two glasses of 
brandy; make a' good raised crust, into 
which put the above; cover, and baka 
the pie in a moderate oven five or six 
hours. Serve it cold. 

MvrroN,Po4pette$ q^.*— Take the lean 
of any joint of cold roasted mutton, para 
off the skin, and mince the meat with a 
little grated baoon and calf 's udder ; sea- 
son with salt, pepper, nutmeg, a few 
mushrooms and panley, shred small ; 
unite them together with the yolks of 
three eggs, and make twelve or fifteen 
balls of It, dip them in beaten egg, and 
bread them twice. Flatten these balls a 
little, and fry them in clarified butter ;

iliirknessof a crown piece, lay them se- 
parately on a dish, covered with chopped 
parsley, vhalocs, scallions, and muiih«

about the size of a walnut ti«tween each 
two slices of mutton, tic them together 
and braise the whole; when about half

htt bfen bnking* Puff-iMttes require a 
moderately hot oven, but not too hot, or 
it will spoil the ahapeand turn it over; 
tart-paite» or short crust, requires a 
slower oven : petits-chouz, one still 
slower ; but for raised pies, let it be as 
hot as lur puflf-paste at first, and well 
closed, so that the pies may not fail. 
Therefore, when you give a dinner where 
paste is necessary, endeavour to make it 
m the morning ; neat your oven first for 
the puff-paste, which must be baked the 
first; then let the oven go gradually 
down, and bake your pastes in rotation, 
as the heat falls. Savoy biscuits require 
a cool oven, and, by degrees, raiw the 
heat as the biscuits are baking. For 
souffles or light puddingy have a gentle 
oven, and contrive so as to have them 
ready by the time they are wanted, or 
they will foil. The greatest attention 
should also be paid in heating the oven 
for baking cakes, particularly for those 
that are large. If not pretty quick, the 
batter will not rite. Sliould >-ou fear its 
catching bv being too quirk, put paper 
over tlie cake to prevent its being burnt. 
If not long enough lighted to have a body 
of heat, or if it has become slack, the 
cake will be heavy. To know when it 
is soaked, take a broad bladed knife 
that Is very bright, and plunge it into 
the centre ; draw it instantly out, and 
if the least stickiness adheres, put the 
cake immediately in, and nhut up the 
oven. If the heat was sufficient to raise, 
but not to soak, fresh fuel must be 
quickly put in, and the cakes kept hot 
until the oven is fit to finish the soaking, 
but this must only be done in a ewe of 
great en ergency ; for thof*e who are em- 
ployed ou^itt to be particularly careful 
that no mistake occur from negligence. 

Ox Cheek BuiletL to be eaten Cotd,^' 
Bone and thoroughly cleanse an ox- 
cheek, then let it steep in white-wine for 
twelve hours ; tlien season it with salt, 
pepi)er, nutmeg, cloves, and mace: roll 
It up, tie it tight with taf»e. boil it In 
water, salt, and vinegar, till it is very 
tender; (tress it hard, and when quite 
cold, cut it into slices, and serve wiiti oil 
and vinegar. 

Ox Cheek Pie. — Bone them, and soak 
them thoroughly in water, boil thorn ten- 
der, cleanse them very well, take out the 
balls of the eyes, season with pepper, 
salt, and nutmeg, then mince some beef 
and some beef suet ; lay this at the bot- 
tom of thediftli, then put in the cheeks 
with a fciv whole cloves, close up tlie pie 
or pai'ty. and put it in tlie oven to bake. 
For paste, as follow* :— half a peck of 
fiour, tlie whites of half a dozen eggs, two 
pounds and a half of butter^ work the 



butter and eggs up dry in the floar, th« 
add a little water to make it asiiff paste, 
and work up all cold. 

Ox Cheek Poiteti^^Ttiln an ox dieek 
and thoroughly wash It, then bone M, rub. 
It over with the same ingrcdicnta that are 
used for potted beef, and set it in the 
oven until it Is tender ; then tmkeoutthe 
fot, the skin, and the palate ; add to a 
pound of the meat two ounces of the fot. 
which swims on the top of the liquor, 
beat It together In m mortar, and finish 
the aame as fbr potted beef. 

Ox Cheek Sfeieei/.— Take half a bead, 
let it soak for three hours, and thoroughly 
clean it with plenty of water. Take the 
meat oflf the bunea, and put it into m pan 
with a large onion, a bunch of aweet 
heriM, some bruised allspice, pepper, and 
salt. Place the bonea on tbe top, poar 
on two or tliree quarta of water, and 
cover the pan very closely with brown 
paper ; let it stand eight or ten hours in 
a slow oven, or let it dmmer by tlie sida 
of the fire. When tender, put tlie meat 
into a clean pan. and let it get quite cold* 
Take oflT the cake of fat, and warm tht 
head In pieces in the soup : put In what 
vegetable you think best. 

Ox Cheek Stewed^-9f»k and well wash 
the day before it ia to be eaten, a fine « 
cheek, put it into astew.pot that will 
cover doae, with three quarta of water« 
and after it has boiled up once and been 
well skimmed, let it simmer ; in two 
hours, add plenty of carrots, leeks, two 
or three lumips, a bunch of sweet herbs, 
some whole pepper, and four ounces of 
allspice ; skim it often ; when tlie meat ia 
tender, take it out; let tlie soup get 
cold, take off the fot, and serve the soup 
either separate or with the meat. It 
ought to be of a nice brown colour, which 
may be done by burnt sugar, or by fry- 
ing some onions quite brown with flour, 
and simmering them with it. This last 
method extremely improves the flavour 
of all soups and gravies of the brown 
kind. If vegetables are not liked in the 
soup, they can be taken out, and a small 
roll toasted, or fried bread, may be added. 
Celerv Is a very great improvement, and 
should always be served. When <^ery 
cannot be procured, the seed is a most ex- 
cellent suDstitute, boiled in, and strained 
ofT. 

Ox Cheek Stewed.—P^ii it to stew with 
just sufficient water to cover it, let it 
simmer for two hours ; peel it, and put 
it into the liquor again, with some pep- 
per, salt, mace, cloves, and wnole 
pepper, tied up in a bit of muslin ; a 
few capers, turnips cut into very small , 
pieces, ana carrots sliced, half a pint of 
beef gravy, a little white vine, and a

consomme, a ladleful of cream ; when re-

has boiled a few times, take them off, and

under the meat; or it may occasion your 
pie to fall or lose its shape ^ when all is 
put in, cover it well over with Cat l>ac(>n,

gravy, put in some liquor in which truffles 
ave been stewed, or some good strong 
veal or beef braize, egg the edge of the

joining it well to the edge, that being a

putuiig it in, that it does not catch or

case, have plenty of paner to lay over it. 
Before the f*\e is quite done, set on som^ 
good consomme or veal braize, and let it 
boil till it becomes very strong, and pour 
it into the pie as noon as it is taken out of 
the oven, and set it to cool ; if the next 
day it should appear to have taken all the

better stand three or four days before it 
is served ; you may, for a change, tHke

fbr ftve days. Boil it sufficiently to take 



out the bones ; then lay it on a dresser, 
turning the thick end of oae side of the 
head towards the thick end of the other, 
to make the roll of an equal size; 
sprinkle it well with salt and white pep- 
per, and roll it with the ears ; and, if 
you think proper, put the pip's feet 
round the outside, when boned, or the 
thin parts of a couple of cow-heels. Put 
it Into a cloth, bind with a broad tape, 
and boil it till quite tender ; then put it 
under a weight, and do not take ofi' the 
covering until it is quite cold. 

If you wish it to be more like brawn, 
salt It longer, and let the proportion of 
saltpetre be greater, and put in also 
some pieces of lean pork, and then cover 
it with cow-heel, to look like the horn. 
This may be kept eitlier in or out of 
pickle of salt and water, boiled with 
vinejsar. If likely to spoil, slice and fry

Rounds of liver, two pounds of bacon, and 
alf a pound ofl>eaf ; mince them all to- 
gether, and then add shred parsley and

so on, alternately, till the mould is full ; 
cover it with slicrs of bacon, and put it 
in the oven^ bake it for three houi-s.

fromage with ease ; make it hot in the 
Aff/M-man'e before you serve it.

heed, vblch leave vtiole ; take a pound 
of ctif'sliTer, a pound of bacon, mince 
both these with a little sage, pounded 
spice, aromatic herbs, salt and pepper: 
fill the body of the pig with this ; also roll

It Ciftrefullr, so tiiat the shape may not be 
spoiled ; do not remove the cluih until 
perfectly colM ; Uy a folded napkin on a 
diah, and serve the pig on it. 

Pio'a Ttulfdla Pirree.*— Take half a 
doxen pigV tails, leave on the skin, and 
cut them into ^lieces about eight inches 
long ; braise with some lentils, two car- 
rocs, two onicms, two doves, a twy-leaf, 
stock, or water, and salt ; when they are 
doi»e, finish in the same manner as pig's 
ears d la purie* 

Pio's Totigues Smoked. ^ — Tuke at 
many pig's tongues as you please, take 
out thn horny parts, scald them suffi- 
ciently to enable you to remove the first 
tkin ; put them as closely together at 
yoQ can, into a jar, rubbmg each with 
salt and a little saltpetre, add basil, bay- 
lea^", thyme, and juniper l>erries; place 
toinethmg heavy on the top to press 
them down ; fill all the interstices with

it in a cool place. In a week's time take 
out the tongues, drain and tie them in 
skills like black puddings, and smoke 
them. 

When the tongues are re(iuired for 
table, boil them in water, witli a little 
wine, a bunch of parsley, scallions, 
onions, thyme, bay-leal, and basil. Serve

tremely freali ; when so, and in oood or- 
der, they are plump and fat at tne vent, 
aod their feet pliable ; but when they are 
stale, the vent is open, green^ and 
withered. Tame pigeons are considered 
preferable to i he wild.

breasts of fowl or game, minced, and 
give these a few turns, with some good 
stock, the yolks of eggs, and rich cream. 
Put a layer of this farce on a dish, then 
place the artichoke bottoms, in each of 
which stick a truffle, and between each 
a pigeon, and a slice of veal glazed on

them hot to table. If you choose you 
may put them into skins, taking caro 
that they aro very clean, filling them 
very gently with a funnel, otherwise 
they may stand a chance of Iwing broken ; 
these aro best for garnishing a turkey.

powder-sugar, and a pinch of salt ; set 
the saucepan on a moderate fire, stirring 
constantly : the moment it beidna to 
thicken, Uke It off that it may more 
readily acquire oonsistenoe ; then replace 
it on the stove, and dry it lor a few mi- 
nutes ; then remove it again, mix with 
it the yolks of sncteen eggs, which should 
reduce it to the consistence of er^me pi' 
HnHre^ if not, pour in the infusion which

frotb, stir them as lightly as possible into 
the above; make the whole quite hot, 
and then pour it into a cnmiiade ; set it

inm into rather large dice, which put 
into a sauceiwn with a little water, and 
boil it till sufficiently done ; then put it 
into a cullender to drain, and when quite

into a mortar, with fiaU a poand of pow- 
der-sugar, an ounce of ocange-flowere, 
and two e^t^ at a time, until five and 
twenty or thirty are used* by wliich time 
the p^ate will be of the proper consis- 
tence, then pour it into a lightly buttered 
tin ; put it into a moderate oven^ and 
leave it. In three lioare' time, if the 
poupcii/t is of a nice gold colour, take it 
out, cut off ihe top, and with a ffpoon 
remov(> all ihe inRide, then set it in the 
oven to dry. When cold, spread all over 
the interior apricot marmalade, on which 
s^rew sweet macaroons crushed, then 
tui-n it on a dinli, and nerve. 

PouPELiM //i>^oirtf.*— Putintoa sauce- 
pan eight glasses uf water, and a« many 
ouncei of buitcr ; «et it on the fire, and 
as soon as it boils take it off, and add 
as much sifted fi.mr as will make a stiff 
pa^te. replace it on the fir'\ stirring con- 
KUnily for some minut/s to dry; then 
take it out, and make a seond quantity 
in the ^ame manner, and when that also 
is dried, put boih into a mortar, with 
three quai ters ot a ptundof su^r, two 
ounces of orange- flower, and stx «*ggs ; 
then beat it up, add six more, and so on 
until the paste U moistened completely 
with fifty or sixty egg^t; pour this pre- 
paration iMt'> a large, well-buttered 
mould of twilve sidcit, and put it into a 
hot oven. In two hours' lime the paste 
will ri!4e above the mould, and some pftfti 
of it fall ove*r, which, however, is un- 
avoidable, arid of no cons^uence. When 
it has stood three hours and a half, draw 
the mould to the opening of the oven, 
and if the tip of tiie poitpelin is of a nice 
c »lour, cut it oti^ and with a large spoon, 
take out all the pai^te from the interior 
of the mould, so as to leave a complete 
croustatie witii'*nffide, which roust remain 
a few minuter to dry; then take it out, 
and when nearly cold, fill this croutiade 
with three pounds of apricot marmalade, 
and over ihvt a pound of sweet macaroons 
crushed ; this dtine, turn the mould over 
on a layer of common paste, nearly an 
inch larger than the top of the mould, 
which may now be removed. ^ Dissolve

iirnamont it mill more, cut out a number 
of leaves of pittachiot or green bi«K:niis, 
irhici) stick on with apricot marmalade, 
in such form as you may tliink proper, 
and between them place well-washed dry 
currants. Serve it as soon- as poasible 
after it is deejrated. 



PO0FELIN d la Aey/ie.^— Make a chotfit 
paste, with very little butter, and a ROi;d 
deal of flour, dry it as much as possible, 
and then dilute it again with eggs. Lay 
your ehottx very small, and of an equal 
size, dorez and put them in the oven ; as 
soon as they are well dried^ and of a nice 
colour, oil the mould you mtend to use ; 
and having clarified and boiled some su- 
gar to ca99{\ take up the choujB on tiie 
end of a nkewer, dip them in the sugar, 
place one in the middle of your mould, 
and Uy the others round it until the in- 
terior is completely covered, taidng care 
that they touch each other : when done, 
turn the mould over carefully on a folded 
napkin, and serve the pwpelin. 

PRAWNS.— When in perfection, tliey 
have an excellent smell, and theirflavour 
is extremelv awert; they are firm and 
stiff, the tailrt (which turn inward) parti- 
cularly. When the prawns are frefth, 
their colour is very bright; but if stale, 
they are pale, and clammy to the touch. 

PBAW.XS Buttered.— Take, them out of 
the shells, and wnrm them with a little 
good gravy, a bit of flour and butter, a 
very little nutmeg, salt and pepper ; sim- 
mer a minute or two, aud serve with 
sippets, or with a creum sauce instead of 
brown. 

Paawjrs {Currie <?/).— See Currieof 
Lobttert* 

PajiirNS in Jelly. — Make a savoury 
fish-jelly, and put some into the bottom 
of a small deep dish; when it is cold, lay 
in the prawns, with their backs down- 
wards, and pour more jelly over them. 
Turn out when cold. 

PaAWirs to Serve.* — Take a pound 
and a half of fine prawn«, pick and trim 
them neatly ; have ready a deep di«h or 
■oup-plate, the centre of which fill with 
anv kind of salading you please, pro- 
vided it has no smell ; c^ver this with a 
large napkin, folded square, and the cor- 
ners turned down, so as to form an octa- 
gon, leaving no more than the border of 
the plate or dish visible ; place a hand- 
ful of nice green parsley on the napkin, 
and the prawns In a pyramid on it. 

PuDDiNO (Directions yi>r).— Take the 
greatest care in boiling of a pudding, that 
the cloth ii perfectly clean, ottierwise 
the outside of the pudding will have a 
disagreeable flavour; to prevent this, tlie 
cloth should always be nicely washed and 
kept in a dry plac^, and when wanted {nr 
use, it should be dipped in boiling water» 
squeezed dry, and floured. 

The water should boil quick when 
the pudding is put in} and it should be- 
moved about for a minute, for fear tlie 
ingredients should not mhc. 

When the padding to done, a pan of 



PUD 



(4M) 



PUD 



rold water should be ready, and the pud- 
ding dipped into it as soon as it comes 
out of the pot, which will prevent its ad- 
hering to the cloth. 

A bread-pudding should be tied loo«e : 
if batter, it must be tied tight over, and 
a batter*pudding should be strained 
through a coante sieve when all is mixed. 
In othent, the eggs^ only. If you boil 
tlie pudding in a btisin or pan, take caie 
that it is always well buttered. 

When you make your puddings with- 
out ef(g8, they must have as little milk 
as will mix, and must boil for three or 
four hours. A few spoonsfiils of small 
beer, or one of yeast, is the best substi- 
tute for eggs. Your puddings will al- 
ways be much lighter if you beat the 
yolks and whites of the eggs long and 
separately. You may. If you please, use 
snow instead of eggs, either in pudainjrs 
or pancakes. Two large spoonsful will 
supply the place of one egsr; the snow 
may be taken up from any clean spot be- 
fore it is wanted, and will not lose its 
virtue, though the sooner it is used the 
better. 

Pudding, i>eriy«At>e.*— Take a pint of 
milk and two table-»poonsful of flour; mix

pound of fine sugar, a little salt, tlie rind 
of a lemon grated, the yolks of five and 
whites of three eggs ; mix it thorougfil^r, 
put a paste round the dish, and bake it m 
a quick oven. It is very aood cold. 

ruDDiNO FranQcua.* — To make this 
pudding it is necesHary to have a dome- 
shaped mould, four inches deep, and six 
in diameter, and a cover to fit the top 
completely, both full of holes, like a cul- 
lender; this mould must be buttered, 
and completely lined with a thin layer 
of paste, which miMt turn over its edges. 
Take two pounds of very round truffles, 
and, without washing, cut them into cir- 
cular pieces, a quarter of an inch thick : 
fry these lightly in a quarter of a poand 
of warm butter, with a large spoonful of 
fowl glaze, half a glass of madeira, a pinch 
of nugnimette, a little grated nutmeg, 
and a proper quantity of salt. Then 
arrange the truffles in your lined mould, 
pour in all the seasonings, turn the edges 
of the paste over them, and cover it 
be«i<!e8 with a layer of paste; put on the 
lid of the mould, tie itinaclotn, and boil 
it lor an hour and a Iwlf. Tiie saucepan 
should be quite full of boiling water ; 
serve the pudding as quick as possible 
alter it is taken up.

or any other ingredient you may wish to 
flavour the preserve with, and then pour 
it ill the glasses again, over the quinces,

the better for hanging three or four days 
before it is put in to the brine : great care 
shonld be taken that all the kernels and 
bloody veins Im; extracted, and the meat 
wiped perfectly dry. When a large quan- 
tity is to be salted, it is best to put it 
Into a large vessel, either of stone, wood, 
lined with lead, or wood only, and cover 
St with a brine made of salt and water, 
sufficiently strong to allow sn egg to float 
on the top. If only a single jomt is re-

when completely covered, lay it in a pan. 
and turn, and rub it every day, until 
wanted.

two of thyme (these three latter articles 
should bo dried in an oven). Put these 
all into A mortar, and pound them to an 
impaiinble pnwder, and sift it. Take a 
pound of fine white vnlt, dry it thoroughly 
in an oven, or stove, pound it as fine as 
possible ; sift, and mix with it an ounce 
of the above* mentioned spices ; anialga* 
mate tliem thoroughly, keep the spiced 
salt in a tin l)ox, which will shut per- 
fectly close. Use it in the following pro-

phire tiiat if green in a pan, sprinkle over 
It two or three handsful of suit, and cover 
it with spring water, and let it lay for 
twenty-four hours; then put it Into a 
large brass saucepan ; throw in a handlul 
of salt ; cover the pnn close, and set it 
over a very slow fire ; let it stand till it is 
quite green, and cri^p ; then take it oflT, 
for if it becomes soft it is spoiled ; put it 
into a jsr, cover it close, and when it is 
cold, tie it down. 

SARDINIAS, Fre#A.* — Take two 
dozen fresh sardinias, dry them thorough- 
ly, flour, and fry them in clarified butter. 
They are also salted and eaten in the 
same manner as anchovies; for ««hicli 
they are frequently used as substitutes. 

SAUCE.— Few things require more 
rare than making sauces, an mo9t of them 
should be stirred constantly, the whole 
attention should be directed to them ; 
the belter way therefore, is to prepare 
the snures before cooking those arttrles 
which demand equal care ; they nrwy be 
kept hot in the bain-marie. Butter, and 
th<ise sauces containing eggs, ought never 
to boil. The thickest stewpans should 
be used for making sauces, and wooden- 
spoonsused for stirring them. 

There is so great a variety of nances, 
that it would nearly fill a volume to enu- 
merate them all. A (ew of the principsl 
are sul>joined, and for manyotliors, see 
the re!>peciive articles of which they are 
composed.

somnte, boil and reduce it; then take off 
the fiat, strain the sauce, and add to it 
some scalded pai-sley, two fat livers, 
capers, anchovies, scallions, all clip- 
ped, add a hit of butter, put it again on 
the nre, and when of tne requisite con- 
sistence, take out the scallions, put in 
some fki^nonctte and lemon-juice, and 
strain it for use.

add puniper and carraways to the salt in 
making saur'Arani : be careful to keep 
the cask in a moderate temperature, 
during ihe whole year. 

Saur-kraut. — Prepare your cask, and 
slice the cabbages as above ; put the lat- 
ter into a tub to ferment for some hours 
(not less than twelve, nor more than 
twenty-four) ; then make a hole at the 
bottom of the tub, and press the cabbages 
bard, to extract all the liquor from them ; 
when quite dry, put a layer of salt at the 
bottom of the cask, on which put a layer 
of the cabbages, on this more salt, pep- 
per, and a few ripe juniper berries ; pro- 
ceed thus alternately until the cask is 
nearly full ; put on a piece of wood, ex- 
actly fitting the in»ide of the cask, on 
which place one hundred and twenty 

Sounds (or more) wright on it. In a few 
ays the brine will form a crust on the 
top of the cask, when the kraut is fie for 
use. On taking it out, une a wooden 
Hpcon onlv ; merely leave sufficient brine 
Ut cover the uauT'kraut ; Uy a wet cloth 
all over tu exclude the air, and then re- 
place the lid and weights. 

The top or the cask should be fre- 
quently washed with s tit and water, and 
part of the brine be drawn oil' occasion- 

iSly. 

8AUR-KRAUT, /o />res«.*— Take out as 
much saur-kraut from the cask as you

large spoonful or two of the syrnp ; stir 
tbem about^ that all maybe tnoroogLly 
saturated with it ; then sprinkle over it 
a handful or two of powder, atill shaking 
the pan to make the seeds equally white. 
When dry, pour on some more symp, 
then the powder, and continue this alter* 
nately until your seeds are mifnciemly 
large ; then lay them on a sieve, keep 
them in a warm place for tome days^ 
after which put them into glass bottles.

keep it in a dry, bat not In a hot place. 
When yen wish to uee it, ecrape it fine,

Let it boil for lour hours. It eaU very

butter a basin, and shake some flour 
round ir, put in your batter, and boil it

Suet Pudding.-^Take half a pound of 
beef suet chopped fine, half a pound of 
flour, two e««s well beaten, a little salt

with milk to a moderate consistence. It 
may be either baked or boiled. 

SUGAR (To CtortTy).* — Take four 
pounds of sngar, and break it into pieces ; 
pat into a preserving-pan the white of an 
eggf and a gla*s of pure sprina water ; 
mix them well with a whisk, add another 
glass, sUU whipping, until two quarts of 
water have been put in ; when the pan 
is full of froth, throw in the sugar, and 
set it on the fire, being careful to skim it 
every time the scum rises, which will be 
the case as the sugar boils up. After a 
few boilings, the sugar will nse so high 
as to run over the edges of the pan, to 
prevent which, thiow on it a little cold 
water ; this will lower it instantly, and 
give time for the skimming, for the scum 
should never be taken off whilst the sugar 
is bubbling; the cold water stills it, and 
tliat is the moment to skim it. Repeat 
this operation csrefuUy three or four 
times, when a whitish light scum only 
will rise : then take the pan ofl^, lay a 
napkin, slightly wetted, over a basin, and 
pour the sugar through it. 

The scum thus taken off, put into a 
jchina basin ; and when the sugar is cla- 



rified, wa«h the pan and die akUMser 
witha ghttsoT wafer, wbloh pat Is the

SvoAa]^ Diferent Degrtet V ^<9"^ 



ffi^. — The variOQt 

sugar is applied, require It to be in di^ 

ferent statea ; tneoe are called degnm^ 

and are thhrteen In nnmber, calMd m 

follows: 

PetiiJjiMBi^ or FirH /legreew— Replaes 
the clarified sngar In the preaerving-paa, 
to boil gently, take a dropof it on the 
thumb, touch it with the fore* finger; if, 
on openina them. It drawa to a ene 
thread, and in tneaklng, forma two drops 
on each finger, it is at die right point. 

Irtsi^. Secimd Degree.-^A mm asoie 
boilina brinas it to this pointi when the 
thread will draw further befoie it bteaks. 

PeHt PeriS, Third Begree.— Atthis 
point the thrnd maybe drawn at terss 
tl^ span will open, without brcnldeg; 

Oramd Perli^ Fmtrth Demrte.^Om 
fttill increasing the boiling, little nised 
balls are formed on tlie surfiace if the 
sugar. 

Pent Queue de Cfchmtt F^kDeme. 
—Take up some of tlie angar an a skim- 
mer, andf drop it on the rest, when it 
shoald form a slanting streak on the sor- 
fRoe. Boil it a little longer, and it will 
reach the 

Grande Queue deCaekom^w Sixth Dtj 
gree. — The streak or tail Is now larger. 

Sovffii, Seventh Degree.— Take out s 
skimmerful of the sugar, blow throagh 
it, and small sparks of sngar will fly 
from it. 

Petit'Phtme, Eighth Degree. — The 
same proof as above ; the spaika should 
be larger and stronger. 

Grande Plume, Mnth Degree.— Take 
the sugar in the skimmer, as before, give 
it a shake, and if the sparks are large, 
and adiiere together on rising, it Is at the 
right point. 

Petit Boulet, Tenth Degree. — Dip 
your fingers in cold water, and tlien late 
the sugar instantly, and anin into tlte 
water, when the sugar will roll into a 
ball, which will be supple when cold. 

Gros Beulet, Eleventh Degree, —Ai 
this point, the ball or bullet will be 
harder when cold than at the la*t. 

Casee, Twelfth Degree. — Prove a« 
above ; the bullet should cnimt>le be- 
tween the finger% and on biting, will 
stick to the teeth ; at tlie next point, 

Caramel, Thirteenth Degree^ — it 
should snap clean. This point is very 
difficult to attain, for in increasing the 
height, the sugar is apt to bum ; it is 
better therefore to try the proof very 
frequently.

Ihem a little Uckamelle^ then cat Miine 
■lore turnips in fthapet, ap tor haricot; 
■iromer them aleo the same ai the firet* 
and then add them t» the othera. 

Tqbiiip Setip. — Be careful in choosing 
your turnips, that they are not in the 
least spongy ; take twelve, and cut them 
about an Inch square ; tlien cut them 
Into the form of a barrel, and put them 
as you do them into a l>asin of water : 
wfaue they are preparing, seta quarter of 
a pound of butter on the fire in a shallow 
stewpan, to clarify; when the turnips 
are ready, and drained from the water, 
put tliem la the butter, and fry them till 
they become of a fine brown colour; then 
pot them on a sieve to drain } after this 
put them into a soup-pot, with a little 
■ugar and suit, and fill it up with am* 
mmumi; set it by the stove to boil gently, 
akim it well, and clarify it the sam^ as 
other soups. It will be a great addition 
to put in At first with the tuiniDS, a few 
heads of celery, cut round and blanched. 
Breail must be put in ihi», as well as 
other clcitr soupn made with vegetables. 

TuaifiFS in rarioui /f'ay*.— Cut them 
in pieces, parlmilcd in salt and water ; 
then slewed in butter, with parsley, scal- 
itons, salt, penper, and nutmeg ; thicken 
the sauce, and s^rve it over them. Par- 
boil, dram, and serve with a sauce 
toturmee ana mustard-sauce mixed. 

ToaifiP-TOPS.*— This vegetable is in 
•eason during the early partoi the sprinK; 
they should be very young, an<i all the 
stalks, and withered leaves taken otf. 
Turnip-tops require a grent deal of water 
lo boil tli^m ; put in some salt, and 
serve them like fp'-nach. 

TuaNiP-ToPH, Fickieii, — Choose them 
yonng, pick ofiali tlie stalks and wither- 
ed leaves, put them into boiling water, 
•et them on the fire, and when tender, 
preso out all the water, aitd leave them ti> 
cool ; then put them into a jar, with 
some salt, and cover them with tlie best 
vinegar. 

TUKTI^E FiH$, — The fins bemg 
stewed with the turtle as in the receipt 
for turtle soup, make a dish of them 
alone, by putting them ii)t> a ste^vpan 
with some good strong etpm^Holff^ and 
some mniieira or |>ort wine, in which let 
Ihem boil gently till the rawnesn is off 
the wine ; then squeea^ in some lemon- 
juiee,lay them on a dinn with a piste 
oorder round the ed^ ; aarnish ihem 
with forcemeat, either m bslNor lengths, 
and pour the sauce over the whole. 
They may be aenwd with an //a/iVnae, 
larriffwi.or any other sauce ; the insida 
iMh of tiM Uirttoi whidi has the appear- 



anee of chicken, may be larded and 
treated as nfricmndeau of veal. 

Turtle A^acp.— The day before you 
dress a turtle, rhop the hrrbs, and make 
the forcemeat ; then, on the preceding 
evening, suspend the turtle by the two 
hind fins with a cord; and put one 
round the neck, with a heavy weight 
attached to it to draw out the neck, that 
the liead may be cut off with more ease ; 
let the turtle hang all nivhr, in which 
time the blood will be well drained from 
the body. Then, early in the morning, 
having yonr stoves, and plenty of hot 
waterin readiness, take the turtle, lay 
it on the table on its hack, and with a 
strong pointed knife cut all round the 
under snelL (which is thecallip^e); there 
are joints at each end, which must be 
carefully found, gently teparating it 
from the callipash (which is the upper 
shell) ; be careful that in cutting out the 
gut you do not break the gall. When 
the callipee and tlie callipash are y^t' 
fectlv separated, take out that part of the 
gut that leads from the throat; that, with 
the three heartt, put into a basin of water 
by themselves ; tne other interior part 
put away. Take the callipee. and cut 
off the meat which adheres to it in four 
quarters, laying it on a clean di^h. Tike 
twenty pounds of vea), chop it up. and 
set it in a large pot, as directed for 
espa^ofe, putting in the flfsli of the 
tuitleat the same time, wiUi all kinda 
of turtle herbs, carrots, onions, one pound 
and a half of lean nam, pepper corDt, 
salt, a little spice, and two bHy-leaves, 
leaving it t<) stew till it takes the colour 
oXrspagHttle ; pui the fins (the »kin being 
scahSed off) and hearts iui, half an hour 
before you nil it, with half water, and half 
beef stock ; then rarefully skim it ; put 
in a bunch of parnlf y, and let it boil 
{centiy, like cofumnme, Wh'le the turtle 
IS Slewing, careiully scald the head, the 
callipee, and all that is soft of the calli- 
pash, attentively obiterving to take off 
the smalli'st particle of skin that may 
remain; put thein with the gut into a 
large pot of water lo hoil till tender ; 
when ^o, take them nut, and cut them in 
squares, put'ing ihem in a ba>in by 
themselves till wanted for the simp. The 
next thing is the thickening of the soup, 
which mu^'t be prep:ired in the same 
manner as sauce tournee* The turtle 
being well done, take out the fins and 
hear til, and lay them on a dinb ; the 
whole of the liquor must pass through a 
sieve into a large pan; then, with a 
ladle, Uke off all the lat, put it into a

through a hievc. When the dinner is 
wanted, skim the turtle, stir it well up, 
Md put in a little salt, if necessary ;

VER 



ViNiaoN Pie or Ptutf, •— All kindi 
of meat intended for piei ftod pasiies 
muMt he highly ipioed when served hot. 
and still more higuly spiced when served 
eold: but the seasoning mast be regu- 
lated by judgobeat and taste. Take one 
or two breasts of veniMn, (according to 
the size you wi4<h to make your pie or 
pasty), bone it thoroughly, bettt it very 
flat, and lard it through and through with 
large lardoiis» well seasoned with all sorts 
of spices, and sweet herbs finely chopped ; 
roll it up as tight as pooaible, and tie it 
up with strong twine. Put into a stew- 
pan the bones and trimmings of the veni- 
Mon, with carrots, onions, pamley, one 
clove of garlic, thyme, bay-lea(^ pepper- 
corns, aiid allspice, and let all stew till 
nearly dry ; fiil it up with equal quanti- 
ties of beef or mutton braise, and water, 
which let boil very ir(*ntly till done, then 
put in the roll of venison ; put paper on 
the tup, cover very close, and let it stew 
gently with fire over and under. When 
sufficiently done, take itofl' the fire, and 
let it stand in the liquor uniil nearly 
cold ; then pi-epare a plain paste of four 
pounds of dour to one pound of butter, 
the same as (nr raised pic, but instead of 
making it stifl^ mix it as noU as possible : 
lay part ol this paste as thick as you well 
con round the edge of the disli ; cut off 
the twine from the venison, skin, and lay 
It in tlie dish, and pour some of the 
gravy it Uh% stewed in ; put on the cover, 
trim it very neatly, make a hole in the 
top, do it over witu egg, and bake it in a 
moderate oven for three or four hours ; 
reduce the remainder of the liquor it 
waa stewed in, and when tlie pie is bak- 
ed, pour it in ; serve it cold. Tlie [MSty 
can scarcely be made too thick. 

Veni<«om Potted. — Put the venison into 
a pan^ and pour red wine over it, and 
cover It with about a pound of butter ; 
pat a p:wteover the pan, set it In the 
oven, and let it be well baked; when 
done, take the meat out of the gravy, 
beat It fine with the butter that haa risen 
to the tup, add more if necessary ; season 
with pepper, salt, and mace pounded; 
put it into pots, set them in the oven tor 
a few minutes ; take them out, and when 
cold, cover with clarified butter. - 

Vajvisoiff Hotuted. — To dreaa the 
haunch, chop off the shank, take off the 
skin, but not any of the Cat ; then fasten 
it on the spit. Make a paste of flour and 
water, roll it out to the shape of the veni- 
son ; lay it on tliick upon the venison, 
paper over tiiat, and secure it well with 
pack-thread. Let it roast at a good dis- 
tance from the fire, and basie it fre^ 
quetitly. About a quarter of an hour 
before servmg take ofl' the paste, dredge 



it with flour, baste it with a bit of butter 
andsprinkleaiittlesaltover it; and when 
of a fine brown colour, take it up. seive 
it on a dish, with a good gravy under it, 
and garnish the bone with cut paper. 
Serve with hot port wroe, or currant jelly, 
in a boat. A neck of veni«on should be 
covered wiiii paste, and roaxted in tlie 
same manner as the haunch, only thai it 
does not require being so much done. 

Vev isuN Satice,^ Serve with venison, 
currant jelly by itself, or warmed with

very fine, a pint of white wine, two 
pounds of sugar, and the rind of an orange 
shred small, add a little nutmeg, and salt ; 
mix it well with the band ; i*oll it out ; 
wrap the venison completely in this 
pante, and bake it for nii hour. Serve it 
with white wine, boiled up with sugar, 
and spice ; strew powder-sugar uver it. 

Venison (to Stew),— Cut the venison 
into slices, and put Uiem into a ^tewpan, 
with a little claret, rosemary, six cloves, 
vinegar, sugur, and grated biead; set 
these on a moderate fire to stew, when 
done, add grated nutmeg, and serve.

a pint of good gmvy, a pint of red wine, 
a large spoonful of currant jelly ; cut the 
venison mto slices, and flour it, and put 
it into thestewpan wiih the ingredients, 
and let it simmer till tender ; take up the 
venison ; thicken the sauce with a Sit of 
butter rolled in flour, and serve it over 
the meat. 

Venison (SAoHlder qf) Stewed.— Tnkt 
out the bone and beat it: have ready 
some slices of mutton (at, tluit have been 
soaked a few hours in port wine, and lay 
them about the venison : sprinlde a Utile 
pepper, and allspice, in fine powder, over 
It, roll It up tight, and tie it. Put it into 
a atewpan that will just bold it, with 
some mutton or t>eer gravy, not too 
strong, half a pint of port wine, some 
pepper, and allspice. Let it simmer very 
closely covered, and as slowly as possible 
for four liours. When quite tender, take 
off the tape, lay the meat in a dish, and 
strain the gravy over it. Serve with cur-

VINhGAR.— This is an acid liquor, 
prepared by a second fermentation from 
various liquors, such as wine cydrr, 

Krry. beer, mead, skimmed milk, &c. 
It the most common method of making 
it, in England, is from malt, and the pro- 
cess is as follows :^iofuse a quantity of 
nalt in hot water for an hour and a half, 
then pour it into a cooler. As voon as 
the infiuion is sufficiently cold, put it 
into deep tuns, add yeast to it, and leave 
It to ferment for four or five diays ; after 
which put ttie liquor into barrels. In a 
loom heated with stoves, so that a mo- 
derate warmth may be kept up for six 
weeks, and tlie fermentation continue 
regularly. By the end of that time 
the whole will be completely soured, and 
must now be changed into other barrels ; 
lay a tile on the bung-holes to keep out 
the wet, but not so close as to prevent a 
free circulation of air, and then place 
them in the open air for four or five 
months, according as the weather is 
warm or otherwise ; during the whole cf 
this period, the fermentation proceeds, 
and at the end, the vinegar is nearly done. 
The next operatkio is this : t!»e vinegar 
to poured into large vessels, called rape- 
tuM, to which there are false bottoms 
eovered with rape, that is, tlie rel^ise of 
r^ins, or other fruit, from which whie 
iiM heen made; fill one of these tuna en- 



tirely with the vinegar, and another about 
three fourths full, and every day take 
a portion of the liquor out of the fullest 
barrel, and put it into the other, until 
Uie vinegar is in a fit sute to be drawn 
off: when it must be closely barrelled. 

Vinegar may also l>e made in much 
smaller quantities for domestic purposes; 
the materials of various kinds, with the 
addition of sugar ; raisins, currants, and 
ripe gooseberries, liowever. are the prin- 
cipal ; sometimes it is made from brown 
sugar, and water alone. The propor- 
tions are the same a« those necessary 
for strong wine ; make the barrel about 
three fourths full, add a toast covered 
with yeast, put in the bung very loosely, 
and place the barrel where it will be ex- 
posed to the sun, or, if it be winter, near 
the fire. The fermentation should be 
moderate and constant till the vinei^ar is 
complete : then draw it ofi* clear, give it 
a boll, ana when quite cold, strain and 
bottle it. 

Vinegar is obtained from wine, by mix- 
ing with tlie latter its own flowens or 
ferment, and its tartar reduced to pow- 
der, and put into a vinegar or any 
other cask; if the latter, it must ok 
placed in a warm ititiiation, full of the 
steam from vinegar ; in either case the 
liquor should be stirred frequently ; the 
second fermentation will speedily com- 
mence ; it will become heated, and turn 
acid by decrees, and in a short time the 
vinegar will be produced. 

It is commonly supposed that wine 
which has become acid, will produce ex- 
cellent vinegar ; thiis however, is a mia* 
taken ides, for tlie stronger and better 
the quality of the wine, tiie stronger and 
better will be the vinegar. 

Tlie French have several methods of 
making vinegar, which are subjoined. 

The vinegar makers of Orleans pour 
the wine, of which they intend to make 
their vinegar, into casks, at the bottoms 
of which are close gratings of lime twias; 
these serve to clarify the wine, aa tne 
lees adhering to the twigs, leave the 
liquor perfectly clear. They then pro- 
cure a numtier of cawk^, each containing 
a hundred gallons, either new or which 
have previoualy contained vinegar ; these 
are set upright, and in the top of every 
one is bored a hole, two inches in diame- 
ter, these are kept constantly open ; the 
last mentioned casks are called ahthere; 
pour into all of them twenty^ five gallons 
of boiling vinegar ; to this, in a week's 
time, add three gallons of wine, drawn 
ttwa the first mentkmed casks; continue 
to add the wine, at intervals of a week, 
until the Mothers are qalte full ; then 
leave them far a fortnight, at the end of 
2U3

which period they generally draw off the 
vinegar, taking care always to leave the 
Moihert halffull, at least, and then to fill 
them with wine as before. The method 
of proving when the vinegar is fit for 
use, ii>, by plunging a stave into it ; if on 
taking it outj a white line is perceptible 
on the end of it, the vinegar is quite 
ready. The place where the casks are 
kept should be very airy, and in the 
winter lime, by means of stoves, the 
temperature should be raised to eighteen 
degrees of Reaumur. 

Parib vinegar varies from the above, 
and the process is very simple. A large 
qtuintity of wine lees is put into coarse 
sacks, and laid in tubs, wnich are placed 
one upon another to form a kind of press; 
by means of a screw, every drop of wine 
is gmdiiiilly squeezed from the tees; this 
operation cannot be performed in less 
time thnn a week. The wine thus ex- 
tracted \A putinto casks ; in the headings 
a hole is made, as above, which holes are 
left constantly open; in summer time 
the casks *o fillea are placed in the sun, 
and, generally speaking, the vinegar is fit 
for use in a fortnight. In the winter, the 
fermentation will last double the time, 
and must be assisted by artificial warmth. 
It sometimes happens that the liftuor 
heats to so great a degree that the hand 
cannot be borne in it ; in this case, the 
progress of the fermentation must be 
checked by adding more wine, until it 
proceeds more regularly, when the 
vinegar is made, put it into casks, which 
hHve the beech twigs at the bottom, as 
abnve mentioned ; Jet it remain a fort- 
night, by which time it will l)e8u(Iiciently 
fermentrd to draw off into the casks for 
keopin^^ it. 

Another very simple method is also 
practiced in France; a few quarts are 
dnurn from a barrel of excellent vinegar, 
and an equal quantity of very clear white 
wine is put into the barrel, close the hung 
lightly, and keep it in a place where the 
heat IS modemte and regular. In a 
month's time draw off the same quan- 
tity a}^nbove, and pour in an equal por- 
tion of white wine. A barrel of good 
vineg.ir will thus sfford a constant sup- 
ply tor a length of time without leaving 
the slightest deposit.

be well sprinkled with flour, to prevent 
its sticking to the moulds) ; when ;rou 
have as many walnut shell* as you wish, 
place them the hollow side dot? nwards/m 
paper; leave them thus lor three or four 
(lays, and then put them into a cool 
oven for a quarter of an hour ; if put 



into too wftrm an oven tke thdli win

meantime boil some sugar to a ayrap, 
witii a little water; when th* asresi- 
meatB are done* waah tke outer part al

compote of apples, raapberriea, or any 
other fruit: noiaten the edm with gUB»

Wauiut Fickle. ^Fut a bandied of 
large double walnuta into a atone jsr; 
take four ounces of black pepper« oet 
ounce of Jamaica pepper* two ounoes d 
ginger, one oimoe of ctovea, a pint if 
muatard seed, two clovea oC garlic» and 
four liandsful of salt ; bruiae the tpke 
and muatard seed, and boil them in as 
much vinegar aa ia sufficient to cover 
the walnuta ; when oold, pour it over tbt 
walnuts ; in two daya boil the pidtlt 
again, pour it to the walouu ianaMdi^ 
ately, cover them doee, and repeat ihit 
for three days. 

Walnut I'icAilf.*— 4Ay your walouH 
in water, and change it every day tor the 
space of three weeks to eoctraet all tbt 
bitterness from tliem ; make a picklt 
with spice, salt, and vinegar ; let it boU 
a quarter of an boor, and pour over the 
walnuts. 

Walnuts, Freeerved with Satgar.^^ 
Gather the walnuts when they have at- 
tained their full site, but before they 
become hard, they should be in thateuts 
that a pin will penetrate them. Prick 
each walnut all over with a large pin, 
put them into cold water, and leave them 
for two hours ; then pour that water 
away, and fill the pan with fresh ; let the 
walnuts remain thus for four days, 
changing the water everjr twenty-four 
hours, to take out all the bittemeas. At 
the end of the time change tlie water, 
and set them on the fire ; as soon as they 
are soft, take tliem out carefully with a 
skimmer, put them again into cold water, 
and leave them four or five days, dbang- 
ing the water as before every tweaty 
four hours. At the ezpiratkm of that 
time place the walnuts in a large glased 
pan. Then take the common sugar ; even 
the refuse of what Ims been clarified will 
be good enough; boil this with some 
water, and run the syrup through a jelly 
bag ; wash the pan that it was boiled in 
well, then put in the filtered syrup, and 
boil it to litii; let it stand, and when 
about half cold, pour it over the walnota, 
and leave them ; next day drain off tftit

Whitings are frequently served to gar- 
nish salmon and ood. 

Whitiko*, />f><rf.* — Take as many 
whitings as you may require ; cleanse, 
scale, and wipe them dry ; then mn them

a stewpan ; when all is done, pour over 
tbem a good cream sauce ; when wanted 
to be served, toss it gently over a mode- 
rate fire, and put it in a dii>h : be careful 
not to use a spoon, as it will break the 
Hakes, and spoil the looks of the di»h. 

WnrriNGs, with Sauce. — Make a brine 
with salt and water, sprigs of parsley, 
■balots, bits of roots, and onions ; let tlie 
whole boil t< gether for half an tiour,

WINB.* — The different methods of 
making English wines having already 
been mentioned under the several arti- 
cles of wliich they are composed, little 
further need be said on the sul^ect. The 
following is a list of the fruits most com- 
monly used for making wines in this 
country :— 

Goosel»erry. 

Currant— red, white, and black. 

Cherry. 

Grape. 

Damson. 

JSloe. 

Strawberry. 

Raspberry. 

Muli»erry. 

Blackberry. 

Elderberry. 

Grape, and the foreign fruits. 

Raisin. 
Orange. 
Lemon. 
Of theae, the best, according to general 
opinion, are of our own fruits, the goose- 
berry, and currant; and of the others, the 
rabin, and orange.

wine, but with little Baccets : from the 
rcKeiublance to the apple and pear, it is 
better adapted to the making of cyder. 

The piincipal defect in the manufac- 
ture of Britittli wineii, is the great quan- 
tity of sugar generally employed. If a 
much larger proportion offruit were used, 
the wine would not only possess a more 
decided character, but be of a higher 
qtiality, and of a much more wholesome 
pature. 

Wine {Madeira) Sauce.*— Take a tea- 
spoonful of flour, and a preserved green 
lemon, cut into dice, mix them with a 
glass of Madeira wine, and a little con- 
somme, add an ounce of butter, some salt 
and nutmcK ; set these on a very hot 
stove to boil for a quarter of an hour ; 
then take it ofl', put in a quarter of a 
pound ef butter, set it again on the fire, 
stirring constantly till the butter is 
meltecl. 

WOODCOCKS.— The greatest possi- 
ble care should be taken, in picking of 
these birds, to handle them as little as 
possible, on account of the skin being so 
particularly tender, and when broken 
It spoils the beauty of the bird. When 
picked, cut ofT the pinions at the first 
joint, press the logs close to the side, 
through which, and the body, pierce the 
beak of the bird ; then cross the feet, 
and lay a slice of bacon over the breast. 
Woodcocks and snipes may be dressed 
according to the same rules. 

Woodcocks. — Take a pound of lean 
beef, cut it into pieces, and put it into a 
saucepan, with two quarts of water, an 
onion stuck with cIov«>s, two blades of 
mace, and some whole pepper; boil all 
these together till reduced to half} then 
strain it oil into another saucepan : draw 
the woodcockK, and lay the trail in a 
plate ; put the woodc<*ck8 into the gravy, 
and let them bin I in it for twelve minutes; 
while they are lx)iling, mince the trail 
and liver vciy small ; put them into a 
small saucepan, with a little mace; add 
four or five »i)oonsfuI of the gravy the 
woodcocks are boiled in : then take the 
orumb ofa^^tale roll, rub it fine into a 
di^h placed before the fire, and put to 
the trail, in the small saucepan, half a 
pint of red poit, a bit of butter, rolled in 
nour, Fct it on the fire, and shake it 
round till the butter if melted; then put 
in the bread-crumbs, and shake the 
Fnucepan round ; lay the woodcocks in 
the dinh, pour the »auce over them, and 
aerve. 

Woodcocks.— These are dressed much 
in the same manner as woodcocks d la 
Duchcste, only that truffles are added to 
the forcemeat. 

Woodcocks a la Ducheuc^^pYii aix 



woodcocks down the bsck, and take oat 
all the inside to make a fmree, vitbtro

cover them with thin slices of bacon; 
add a glass and a half of red wine«aod s 
few spoonsful of cullis: when done, 
strain, and skim the sauce, and thickea 
it with butter and flour. 

Woodcocks Farced. — Split the wood- 
cocks at the back, take out all the insidf, 
and mix it with a little scraped bacoo. 
chopped parsley, shalots, pepper, and 
salt; stufl'the iniiodcockB with this, aad 
sew them up ; srrap them In slices of 
bacon, and over Umt, paper; then put 
them down to roast; serve with whst 
sauce or rago^ you think best. 

Woodcocks d la Fran^ite, — Pick, 
draw, aod truss them ; lard their breisti 
with broad pieces of bacoo ; roast tbeai, 
and serve them upon toasts dipped in 
veriuice. 

Woodcocks Minced en Croustadet^'^ 
Take the meat from some cold roasted 
woodcocks, clear away all the sinews sad 
sk^n, and mince it as fine as possible. 
Pound the intestines (except the gizard) 
and remnants of the birds. Pot a glass 
of Champagne wine, and three shalot« 
into a saucepan ; set it on the fire, and 
when it has boiled up a few times, add 
four ladlesful of reduced espagfufk^ a bit 
of glaze of game; boil these, and then pat 
in the pounded meat ; stir them well to- 
gether, taking care it does not boil; 
strain the puree, and keep it hot. Make 
nine heart-shaped cr^t(mM^ as usual (tee 
Fillets en canapes), and when dcai ed out, 
put the mince to the pwree^ mix ttcm to- 
gether with some butter, and then fill 
the hearts with it, and dish theDi,tl'e 
points inwards ; lay a poached egg on 
each, and serve th^m. 
Woodcocks in a J/Zme/e.*— Puta brace 
of woodcocks into a frying-pan, with some 
butter, shred shalots, grated nutmeg, 
salt, and pepper ; set the pan on a fierce 
fire, and fry the woodcocks lightly for 
seven or eight minutes; tlien add the 
juice of twolemons, half a glass of white 
wine, and some raspingii; and leave 
them on the fiie till tlie sauce has boiled 
up once ; then serve alUtgetlier. 

Woodcock Pie (Ofld), — When tie 
woodcocks arc picked, take out the en- 
trails, and put them aside, and miss the 
birds, as for roasting ; flatten the t>reast- 
bone, and broil then over a clear char*
