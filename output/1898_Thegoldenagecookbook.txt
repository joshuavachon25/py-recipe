And God said, Behold, I have given you everv herb bearing 
seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in 
the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be 
for meat. And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of 
the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein 
there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was 
so. Genesis i., 29, 30. 

Thou shalt not kill Exodus xx., 13. . 

For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts ; 
even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the 
other; yea, they have all one breath ; so that a man hath no pre- 
eminence above a beast : for all is vanity. All go unto one place ; 
all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again. Who knoweth the 
spirit of man that goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast that 
goeth downward to the earth? Ecclesiastes iii., 19, 20, 21. 

He that killeth an ox is as if he slew a man. Isaiah Ixvi., 3. 

Then said Daniel to Melzar [the steward], whom the prince 
of the eunuchs had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and 
Azariah : Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let 
them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink. Then let our 
countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenance 
of the children that eat of the portion of the king's meat: and 
as thou seest, deal with thy servants. So he consented to them 
in this matter, and proved them ten days. And at the end of 
ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh 
than all the children which did eat the portion of the king's 
meat. Daniel i., 11 to 17. 



I SEND this little book out into the world, first, to aid those 
who, having decided to adopt a bloodless diet, are still 
asking how they can be nourished without flesh ; second, in the 
hope of gaining something further to protect " the speechless 
ones " who, having come down through the centuries under 
" the dominion of man," have in their eyes the mute, appeal- 
ing look of the helpless and oppressed. Their eloquent silence 
should not ask our sympathy and aid in vain ; they have a 
right, as our humble brothers, to our loving care and protec- 
tion, and to demand justice and pity at our hands ; and, as a 
part of the One Life, to 

"life, which all can take but none can give ; 
Life, which all creatures love and strive to keep ; 
Wonderful, dear, and pleasant unto each, 
Even to the meanest; yea, a boon to all 
Where pity is, for pity makes the world 
Soft to the weak and noble for the strong. 
Unto the dumb lips of the flock he lent 
Sad, pleading words, showing how man, who prays 
For mercy to the gods, is merciless, 
Being as god to those ; albeit all life 
Is linked and kin, and what we slay have given 
Meek tribute of their milk and wool, and set 
Fast trust upon the hands which murder them." 

If the cruelty and injustice to animals are nothing to us, 
we have still another argument to offer the brutalization of 
the men who slaughter that we may eat flesh. Mrs. Besant, 
in "Why I Am a Food Reformer," says: 

" Lately I have been in the city of Chicago one of the 
greatest slaughter-houses of the world where the slaughter- 
men, who are employed from early morn till late at night in the 
killing of thousands of these hapless creatures, are made a class 
practically apart from their fellow-men; they are marked out 



by the police as the most dangerous part of the community; 
amongst them are committed most crimes of violence, and 
the most ready use of the knife is found. One day I was 
speaking to an authority on this subject, and I asked him how 
it was that he knew so decidedly that most of the murders and 
the crimes with the knife were perpetrated by that particular 
class of men, and his answer was suggestive, although horrible. 
He said : There is a peculiar turn of the knife which men 
learn to use in the slaughter-house, for, as the living creatures 
are brought to them by machinery, these men slit their throats 
as they pass by. That twist of the wrist is the characteristic 
of most crimes with the knife committed amongst our Chicago 
population.' That struck me at once as both a horrible and 
significant fact. What right have people to condemn other men 
to a trade that makes them so readily take to the knife in anger; 
which marks them out as specially brutalized brutes amongst 
their fellow-men? Being constantly in the sight and the smell 
of blood, their whole nature is coarsened ; accustomed to kill 
thousands of creatures, they lose all sense of reverence for 
sentient life, they grow indifferent to the suffering they contin- 
ually see around them ; accustomed to inflict pain, they grow 
callous to the sight of pain ; accustomed to kill swiftly, and 
sometimes not even waiting until the creature is dead before 
the skin is stripped from it, their nerves become coarsened, 
hardened, and brutalized, and they are less men as men because 
they are slaughterers of animals. And everyone who eats flesh 
meat has part in that brutalization ; everyone who uses what they 
provide is guilty of this degradation of his fellow-men. 

" If I may not appeal to you in the name of the animals 
if under mistaken views you regard animals as not sharing your 
kind of life then I appeal to you in the name of human brother- 
hood, and remind you of your duty to your fellow-men, your 
duty to your nation, which must be built up partly of the chil- 
dren of those who slaughter who physically inherit the very 
signs of this brutalizing occupation. I ask you to recognize 
your duty as men and women who should raise the Race, not 



degrade it ; who should try to make it divine, not brutal ; who 
should try to make it pure, not foul; and therefore, in the 
name of Human Brotherhood, I appeal to you to leave your 
own tables free from the stain of blood and your consciences 
free from the degradation of your fellow-men." 

That flesh-eating is not necessary to the perfect health of 
man is attested by many scientists. The following testimonies 
from some very prominent physiologists and anatomists may 
prove interesting : 

Sir Charles Bell, F. R. S. : " It is, I think, not going too 
far to say that every fact connected with the human organiza- 
tion goes to prove that man was originally formed a frugivorous 
animal. This opinion is principally derived from the formation 
of his teeth and digestive organs, as well as from the character 
of his skin and the general structure of his limbs." 

Sylvester Graham, M. D. : " Comparative anatomy proves 
that man is naturally a frugivorous animal, formed to subsist 
upon fruits, seeds, and farinaceous vegetables." 

Professor Win. Lawrence, F. R. S. : "The teeth of man 
have not the slightest resemblance to those of carnivorous 
animals ; and, whether we consider the teeth, jaws, or digestive 
organs, the human structure closely resembles that of the fru- 
givorous animals." 

Dr. Jozef Drzewiecki : " There is no doubt that fruit and 
vegetable food purifies the blood, while meat inflames and is 
the source of many diseases, which are the punishment for 
breaking the natural law and command." 

Professor Vogt : " The vegetarian diet is the most bene- 
ficial and agreeable to our organs, as it contains the greatest 
amount of carbon hydrates and the best proportion of albumen." 

Sir Henry Thompson, M. D., F. R. C. S. : " It is a vulgar 
error to regard meat in any form as necessary to life. All that 
is necessary to the human body can be supplied by the vegeta- 
ble kingdom. . . . The vegetarian can extract from his food 
all the principles necessary for the growth and support of the 
body, as well as for the production of heat and force. It must 

7 



be admitted as a fact beyond all question that some persons 
are stronger and more healthy who live on that food. I know 
how much of the prevailing meat diet is not merely a wasteful 
extravagance, but a source of serious evil to the consumer." 

The following special cablegram from London to the New 
York " Sun," July 3d, 1898, contains a practical illustration of 
the superiority of a vegetable diet : 

" The vegetarians are making a great ado over the triumph 
of their theory in the long-distance test of walking endurance, 
seventy miles, in Germany, this week. The twenty-two starters 
included eight vegetarians. The distance had to be covered 
within eighteen hours. The first six to arrive were vegetarians, 
the first finishing in 14^ hours, the second in 14^, the third 
in 15^, the fourth in 16, the fifth in 16^, and the sixth in 
17^. The last two vegetarians missed their way and walked 
five miles more. All reached the goal in splendid condition. 
Not till one hour after the last vegetarian did the first meat- 
eater appear, completely exhausted. He was the only one. 
Others dropped off after thirty-five miles." 

There is no question of the great economy of vegetarian- 
ism. Dr. Alcott, in " Arguments for Vegetarianism," says: 

" Twenty-two acres of land are needed to sustain one man 
on fresh meat. Under wheat that land will feed forty-two peo- 
ple ; under oats, eighty-eight ; under potatoes, maize, or rice, 
one hundred and seventy-six ; under the banana, over six thou- 
sand. The crowded nations of the future must abandon flesh- 
eating for a diet that will feed more than tenfold people by the 
same soil, expense and labor. How rich men will be when they 
cease to toil for flesh-meat, alcohol, drugs, sickness, and war !" 

"Suffer the ox to plough, and impute his death to age and Nature's 

hand. 
Let the sheep continue to yield us sheltering wool, and the goats the 

produce of their loaded udders. 

Banish from among you nets and snares and painful artifices, 
Conspire no longer against the birds, nor scare the meek deer, nor hide 

with fraud the crooked hook ; . . . . 
But let your mouths be empty of blood, and satisfied with pure and 

natural repasts."* 

* Imputed to Pythagoras.

O Golden Age, whose light is of the dawn, 
And not of sunset, forward, not behind, 
Flood the new heavens and earth, and with thee bring 
All the old virtues, whatsoever things 
Are pure and honest and of good repute, 
But add thereto whatever bard has sung 
Or seer has told of when in trance or dream 
They saw the Happy Isles of prophecy ! 
Let Justice hold her scale, and Truth divide 
Between the right and wrong ; but give the heart 
The freedom of its fair inheritance."

Bread, Biscuit, and Rolls. 

BEATEN BISCUIT.-No. J. 

One quart of flour, two teaspoonfuls of baking 
powder sifted with the flour, a quarter of a tea- 
spoonful of salt, a large heaping tablespoonful of but- 
ter, milk enough to make a stiff dough. Beat with 
a rolling pin or in a biscuit-beater for ten or fifteen 
minutes until the dough blisters. Roll out about 
half an inch thick or less, prick well with a fork and 
bake in a quick oven. 

BEATEN BISCUIT.-No. 2. 

Two quarts of flour, three ounces of butter, a 
little salt and enough water to make a stiff dough. 
Beat with a rolling pin or in a biscuit-beater twenty 
minutes until the dough blisters or snaps. Roll out 
about half an inch thick, prick well with a fork and 
bake in a quick oven. This dough rolled very thin, 
cut with a large cutter, pricked -well and baked in a 
quick oven makes delicious wafers to serve with tea 
or chocolate. 

BAKING-POWDER BISCUIT. 

One quart of sifted flour, three-quarters of a cup 
of butter, two heaping teaspoonfuls of baking pow- 
der, one teaspoonful of salt, enough milk to make a 
soft dough. Do not handle any more than is neces- 
sary. Roll thin, cut in small biscuits, prick with a 
fork and bake in a quick oven. 

CREAM BISCUIT. 

One quart of flour sifted, two rounded teaspoon- 
fuls of Cleveland's baking powder, two cupfuls of 

13 



cream and a little salt. Mix, roll out about a quar- 
ter of an inch thick, cut with a small biscuit-cutter, 
prick with a fork and bake fifteen or twenty minutes 

in a quick oven. 

FRENCH ROLLS. 

Two quarts of sifted flour, a pint of warm milk, 
half a cup of butter melted in the milk, a quarter of 
a cup of sugar, three or four eggs beaten light, a little 
salt, a half cake of compressed yeast, dissolved in a 
little warm milk. Make a batter of the milk and 
flour, add the eggs and sugar, beat hard for fifteen 
minutes. Cover the pan and set to rise, over night 
if for luncheon, in the morning if for tea. Knead 
well, but do not add any more flour. Make them 
into shape and let them rise again until light. Bake 
about fifteen minutes in a quick oven. For buns add 
cinnamon. Sift the flour before measuring, and 
measure lightly. 

RAISED FINGER-ROLLS. 

Half a pint of milk, half a pint of water, one- 
third of a compressed yeast cake, one teaspoonful of 
sugar, two teaspoonfuls of butter, one teaspoonful 
of salt. Dissolve the yeast cake in a little tepid 
water, mix as usual, make into a soft dough at night, 
bake for breakfast or luncheon. 

WINDSOR ROLLS. 

Melt half a cup of butter in three-quarters of a 
pint of warm milk, dissolve one cake of compressed 
yeast in a little tepid milk, stir together and add a 
teaspoonful of salt and enough flour to make like 
bread dough, set to rise in a warm place. It will rise 
in about two hours. Roll out the dough, using as 
little flour as possible to keep it from sticking, and 
cut with a biscuit-cutter, or mould with the hands 
into rolls, put them in pans, and set on the shelf over 

14 



the range to rise about ten or fifteen minutes. Bake 
fifteen or twenty minutes. 

ELIZABETTI ROLLS. 

One cup of sweet milk, half a yeast cake, an even 
tablespoonful of butter, two teaspoonfuls of sugar, 
and one of salt, and flour enough to make as stiff as 
bread dough. Scald the milk and melt the butter in 
it, when lukewarm dissolve the yeast cake, sugar and 
salt and stir the flour in until as thick as bread 
dough. Set to rise over night. In the morning roll 
thin, cut with a biscuit-cutter, put a tiny lump of 
butter on each biscuit, fold in half, set to rise again, 
and when light bake about twenty minutes in a 
moderate oven. This quantity -will make twenty- 
four rolls. 

RYE ROLLS. 

Take in the morning from rye bread dough one 
cupful, add to it a tablespoonful of Porto Rico mo- 
lasses, one tablespoonful of sour cream, one even 
tablespoonful of butter. Bake in cups, half fill them, 
set in a warm place to rise for three-quarters of an 
hour, and bake fifteen minutes. This quantity will 

make eight. 

GLUTEN ROLLS. 

Three cups of kernel flour, two even tablespoon- 
fuls of baking powder, half a teaspoonful of salt, 
two cups of milk. Mix the flour, salt and baking 
powder together, then stir in the milk, beat well. If 
baked in iron roll pans heat them well, brush with 
butter; if granite ware, only grease them. This 
quantity will make sixteen rolls. Bake from twenty 
to twenty-five minutes. 

PARKER HOUSE ROLLS. 

Sift two cups of flour with half a teaspoonful of 
salt and one teaspoonful of sugar, then add a cup of 

15 



tepid water in which a cake of compressed yeast has 
been dissolved, two tablespoonfuls of melted butter; 
when mixed break in one egg and add flour enough 
to make a soft dough. Knead well, beating the 
dough upon the board. Set to rise in a warm place, 
when light knead again, adding only enough flour to 
keep from sticking to the board, roll out about half 
an inch thick, cut with a biscuit-cutter, brush with 
melted butter, fold in half and set to rise again. 
These rolls can be set at noon if for tea, or in the 
morning if for luncheon, or they can be made up at 
night for breakfast, when use only half a yeast cake. 
This dough can be moulded into small, oblong rolls 
for afternoon teas. 

BOSTON BROWN BREAD. 

One cup of yellow corn meal, one cup and a half 
of Graham flour, an even teaspoonful of salt, an even 
teaspoonful of soda, two cups of sour milk, half a 
cup of Porto Rico molasses, and butter the size of a 
large walnut. Sift the corn meal and soda together, 
add the Graham flour and salt, then the milk and 
molasses, melt the butter and stir in at the last. 
Butter a brown bread mould, pour in the mixture, 
steam for three hours, keep the water steadily boil- 
ing, remove the cover of the mould, and bake twenty 
minutes in the oven to form a crust. 

BOSTON BROWN BREAD WITH RAISINS. 
Follow the preceding recipe, adding a cup of rai- 
sins stoned and slightly chopped. Very nice for nut 
sandwiches and stewed bread. 

BOSTON BROWN BREAD STEWED. 
Cut the bread into dice, and when the milk boils 
add the bread and stew gently fifteen minutes. The 
proportion is about a cup of milk to one of bread. 

16 



GRAHAM BREAD. 

Haifa pint of milk, half a pint of water, a pint 
and a half of white flour, an even teaspoonful of salt, 
half a yeast cake dissolved in tepid water. Scald the 
milk and add the half pint of boiling water, set away 
to cool. Put the flour into the bread pan, add milk 
and water when lukewarm and the dissolved yeast ; 
beat well. In the morning add half a cup of Porto 
Rico molasses and Graham flour enough to knead 
well, let it rise for three hours, knead again, make 
into loaves and set in a warm place to rise. When 
light bake in a moderate oven nearly an hour. 

RYE BREAD. 

Dissolve half a yeast cake, two heaping tea- 
spoonfuls of sugar and one of salt in a cup and a 
third of tepid water, then stir into it a pint of white 
flour, and when smooth add enough rye flour to 
make a dough rather stiffer than that of white 
bread. Knead thoroughly about fifteen minutes and 
set to rise. In the morning make into a loaf and put 
in a crusty bread pan. 

QUICK WHITE BREAD. 

Three pints of flour, an even teaspoonful of salt, 
two cakes of compressed yeast dissolved in tepid 
water and enough milk to make a soft dough. Set 
in the morning, it will require about an hour and a 
half to rise, and, after making into loaves, about ten 
minutes. 

DATE BREAD. 

Break the dates apart, wash and drain them in a 
colander, shake them well, set in a warm place to 
dry. Stone and chop enough to make a cupful, and 
knead into a loaf of white bread just before setting 
to rise for the last time. 

17 



COFFEE BREAD.-No. J. 

One pound of flour, two eggs, six tablespoonfuls 
of melted butter, six ounces of sugar, a teaspoonful 
of soda, a teaspoonful of cream of tartar mixed dry 
in the flour, and one cup and a half of milk. Beat 
the butter and sugar together, add the eggs well 
beaten, a few grains of cardamom, half a cupful of 
raisins seeded, and a tablespoonful of citron cut fine, 
if liked, then add the milk and flour. Bake in crusty 
bread pans or shallow pans, as convenient. 

COFFEE BREAD.-No. 2. 

Half a pound of flour, one egg, two teaspoonfuls 
of sugar, a small pinch of salt, three tablespoonfuls of 
melted butter, three-quarters of a cup of milk, one 
even teaspoonful of soda, two scant teaspoonfuls of 
cream of tartar. Mix and bake in a crusty bread

very nice, brush each half over with white of egg and 
sprinkle with sugar and chopped almonds. The car- 
damom seed may be omitted if not liked.

Soups* 



Bran tea, made in the proportion of a pint of bran to three 
quarts of water, is used by many vegetarians as a foundation for 
soup. Butter should be used generously with it. 

A broth made from white beans is also good where a white 
stock is required. Pick over the beans carefully, soak over night, 
drain and add fresh water in the morning three pints of water to 
a pint of beans cook gently until tender. If it is to be used as a 
stock, strain without mashing the beans. If the water they are 
boiled in is hard, a small pinch of soda will soften it.

with a tablespoonful of butter, let them simmer in 
this for a few minutes without taking color, then

ful of butter in a saucepan, and stir into it half a 
tablespoonful of flour, add the pure of asparagus 
and let it come to a boil, season with salt and pepper 

31 



to taste. Have the asparagus points cooked tender 
in a little water. Have ready a pint of boiling milk,

soup, put the asparagus points into the tureen. Beat 
two egg yolks with four tablespoonfuls of cream, 
stir quickly into the soup and pour into the tureen.

water in which they were boiled. Put back in the 
saucepan on the range, let it come to a boil, then add 
a heaping tablespoonful of butter and a pint of boil- 
ing milk, stir well, remove and press through a puree 
sieve that it may be smooth. Beat four tablespoon- 
fuls of cream, add when the soup is in the tureen and 
serve immediately. This soup is very nice when made 
from the best canned lima beans, using two cans and 
following the recipe as above. 

CREAM OF CAULIFLOWER. 

Cut one small cauliflower into flowerettes, reserve 
a tablespoonful, put the rest into a saucepan with 
three cups of boiling water, one small white onion,

etables into a double boiler with two heaping table- 
spoonfuls of butter, a heaping tablespoonful of flour, 
salt and pepper to taste ; steam for ten minutes. Put 
the flowerettes into the water the vegetables were 
boiled in and cook until tender, remove and put aside 
to keep warm, measure the water and add sufficient 
from the kettle to make two cupfuls, pour this over 
the vegetables, cook until tender and press through 

32 



a fine sieve. Bring two cups of milk to the boiling 
point, turn the pure into this, let it boil up once, 
remove from the fire. Beat two egg yolks and four 
tablespoonfuls of rich cream together, add some of 
the soup to this, then mix all together, turn into the 
tureen, add the flowerettes and serve at once. 

CREAM OF CELERY. 

Take of the coarser parts of celery as much as 
will make two heads, w r ash and cut in pieces, put in 
a saucepan with half an onion cut in slices and cover 
with boiling water. Cook until tender and press 
through a sieve with the water in which it was 
boiled. Make a roux of butter and flour as in other 
cream soups, add the pure"e to it and as much boiling

small white onion, put in a saucepan with enough 
boiling water to cover them, cook until tender, press

where it will keep hot without cooking. Have a 
cream sauce ready, made by melting two heaping 
tablespoonfuls of butter in a saucepan with two 
tablespoonfuls of flour, let them cook together until 
the mixture no longer adheres to the pan, then add 
gradually a quart of milk, an even teaspoonful of 
white pepper, a heaping teaspoonful of salt, let it boil 
for a few minutes until thick and pour into the 
cucumber puree, add two tablespoonfuls of rich 
cream, let it come to the boiling point, and serve at 
once. This is a very delicate soup, and cooking or 
standing on the stove after it is done will spoil it. 
Groult's potato flour is nicer for thickening cream 
soups than the common flour, but, if used, only half 
the quantity called for in the recipes is needed. 

CREAM OF SUMMER SQUASH. 
Peel the squash, slice thin, put in a saucepan and 
add boiling water to come nearly to the top of the

and a quart of milk. Let it boil for twenty minutes 
until the rice is perfectly tender, remove from the fire 

34

masher, then strain and press again through a fine 
hair sieve; this will make it smooth. Season with 
salt to taste and a dash of cayenne pepper, and a 
small half teaspoonful of sugar. Put in a fresh sauce- 
pan, rub together two heaping teaspoonfuls of butter 
and an even teaspoonful of cornstarch and stir into 
the soup. Let it come to the boiling point and 
remove from the fire, adding at the last moment a 
quarter of a cupful of whipped cream. Serve with or 
without fried croutons. 

CREAM OF MUSHROOMS. 

Wash one pound of mushrooms, skin and stem 
them. Put the skins and stems in a saucepan with a 
cup of boiling water and boil ten minutes, strain and 
add to this water the mushroom flaps chopped very 
fine, and cook until tender, then press through a fine 
sieve. Melt two large heaping tablespoonfuls of 
butter in a saucepan, and stir into it two heaping 
tablespoonfuls of flour, and when smooth add a 
quart of rich milk, a whole clove of garlic, salt and

with the following sauce in a sauce boat. 

SAUCE. Boil the skins and stems of the mush- 
rooms in a cup of water; while they are cooking, 
brown together in a spider a slightly heaping table- 
spoonful of butter, a slightly heaping tablespoonful 
of flour, and a small slice of onion cut very fine. 
Strain the mushroom skins and stems and add the 
water they were cooked in to the browned butter 
and flour, and when the sauce is thick and smooth 
turn it into a saucepan and add to it a heaping table- 
spoonful of mushrooms, one small cucumber pickle 
and two large olives, all chopped very fine. Let all

an inch deep. Bake in a quick oven ; when done lift 
the centers out carefully with a knife, remove a little 
of the inside. When wanted heat the patty shells and 
fill with spaghettina in tomato sauce, mushrooms or 
vegetables in a cream or savory sauce, or the filling 
as given for spinach border mould. A few truffles

Vegetables. 



Vegetables should be cooked in as little water as possible ; the 
better way is to steam them. So much of the valuable salts are 
washed out by boiling in too much water. 

All vegetables left over can be warmed again, either in a cream 
sauce, or put in a double boiler and steamed, adding a little more 
butter. 

When pepper is used, it should always be white pepper, espe- 
cially in white sauces and soups. 

Never salt vegetables until the3' are nearly cooked ; it hardens 
them. 

The water vegetables are boiled in may be utilized in making 
sauces and soups ; the best of the vegetables goes into it. 

The water Jerusalem artichokes are boiled in becomes quite 
a thick jelly when cold, and makes an excellent foundation for 
sauces. 

TO BOIL POTATOES. 

Select potatoes of uniform size, wash and pare 
thinly, cover with boiling water and cook half an 
hour ; when nearly done add salt. As soon as done 
drain from the water and set the saucepan where the 
potatoes can steam for a few minutes. They should 
be served immediately, and never allowed to remain 
in the water a moment after they are cooked. Pota- 
toes are much better steamed with their skins on 
than boiled, as they then retain all the potashes. 
When they are old they should be washed, pared and 
covered with cold water, and allowed to stand for 
several hours before either boiling or frying. 

POTATOES BAKED. 

Select them of uniform size, wash and scrub well, 
cut a thin slice from each end to prevent their being 
soggy. They require nearly an hour to bake in a 
moderate oven. 

57 



TO MASH POTATOES. 

Boil the potatoes carefully, drain from the -water, 
mash fine, and to four good-sized potatoes add a 
heaping tablespoonful of butter, a tablespoonful or 
two of cream or rich milk and salt and pepper to 
taste. Serve at once. They must be freshly mashed 
and very hot to be eatable. The mashed potatoes 
maybe squeezed through a vegetable ri9er, when they 
are called Potatoes a la Neige. 

NEW POTATOES WITH CREAM SAUCE. 

Select rather small potatoes of uniform size and 
boil. When done drain oif the water, set them back 
on the stove to keep hot while making a cream sauce, 
then put them carefully in a vegetable dish, pour the 
sauce over them and sprinkle with a little finely 
minced parsley. 

BROILED POTATOES. 

Take some cold boiled potatoes and cut them in 
rather thick slices lengthwise, dust with white pepper 
and salt, dip each slice in melted butter, broil over a 
clear fire until a nice brown. Serve with melted but- 
ter and finely minced parsley poured over them.

come dry. 

STUFFED POTATOES.

skins, brush the tops over with melted butter, brown 
in the oven and serve. 

POTATO FRICASSEE.

too long, or the sauce will curdle. Pour into a vege- 
table dish, sprinkle a little finely minced parsley over 
the top and serve. 

POTATOES A LA DUCHESSE.

and brown in the oven. Arrange on a platter, gar- 
nish with parsley and serve. 

SARATOGA CHIPS. 

Peel some medium-sized white potatoes, and slice 
them very thin. It is better to have a potato slicer 
for these, if possible, as it cuts them so quickly and 
perfectly. Wash the potatoes in one or two waters, 
then cover with fresh water and lay a lump of ice on 
the top of them. Let them stand an hour, if con- 
venient, drain in a colander, wipe dry with a towel, 
and fry in boiling fat not too many at a time in the 
basket or they will stick together, and will not 
brown. Have a quick fire, and fry until brown and 
crisp, drain on paper, sprinkle with salt and serve. 

59

the basket from the fat, sprinkle with salt, shake the 
grease from them and remove with a skimming 
spoon, drain on paper and serve at once.

out taking color. Then add two tablespoonfuls of 
tomatoes, an even teaspoonful of grated onion and 
one of chopped green pepper, fill up the spider with 
boiling water, and set it back on the stove -where it 
will stew gently until the vegetables are tender and 
the water has been reduced to one-third the quantity. 
It should be as thick as ordinary gravy ; if not, add 
a scant teaspoonful of flour. Just before it is done 
stir in a heaping tablespoonful of butter. Turn it 
into a shallow vegetable dish and serve very hot. 
The spider should be kept covered while the curry is

water as will cook them. When they are both tender 
put them together into a saucepan, add a heaping 
tablespoonful of butter and half a tablespoonful of 

73 



flour rubbed together, and if there is not enough 
water left, add enough to make a gravy. Canned 
instead of fresh peas may be used ; drain the water 
from the peas and stew the carrots in it, and follow- 
the recipe as above. 

SPINACH PUDDING. 

Make a sauce of one ounce and a half of butter, 
one ounce of flour, a scant half cup of rich milk, half 
a teaspoonful of sugar, a grating of nutmeg, if liked, 
and salt and pepper to taste. When this conies to a 
boil, add an even cupful of spinach that has been 
cooked and finely chopped, and from which the water 
has been well pressed out. Remove from the stove, 
and stir into it two beaten eggs. Grease a mould, 
sprinkle it with dried and sifted bread crumbs, turn 
the pudding into this, set the mould in a pan of hot 
water, put in the oven, cover it to prevent browning 
and bake nearly three-quarters of an hour. Turn 
out on a platter, have ready a cream sauce to pour

boil, and then add three-quarters of a cup of cooked 
and finely chopped spinach, beat well and remove 
from the fire. When cold add two eggs, one at a 
time, season with salt and pepper to taste and half a 
saltspoonful of powdered mace. Have a saucepan 
of boiling water, slightly salted, on the stove ; dip a 

74 



tablespoon in cold water, and then take up enough 
of the spinach mixture to make an oblong cake, in 
shape like an egg cut in half lengthwise, then dip the 
spoon in the boiling water and let the cake float off. 
Use all the mixture in this way. The balls will cook 
in four or five minutes, and they must not boil too 
fast or they will break. Let them drain in a colander 
while making a cream sauce, and when the sauce is 
made put the balls into it and let them come to a 
boil, turn out on a platter and garnish with parsley.

leaves, and cut enough of the stem off to allow it to 

stand well in the dish it is to be served in. Put it into 

a saucepan, cover with boiling water, and when it is 

75 



nearly done add salt, as cooking it long with salt 
turns it brown. The usual time to cook a cauli- 
flower is about twenty minutes. Try it -with a fork, 
and if it is tender remove carefully from the water, 
let it drain in a colander while preparing a drawn 
butter. Then put into a hot vegetable dish, pour the 
sauce over and serve.

two heaping tablespoonfuls of American Edam or 
grated Parmesan cheese, put the flowerettes into a 
baking dish, pour the sauce over them, sprinkle the 
top with a little of the cheese, and stand the dish in 
the oven for a few minutes to brown.

ble with a potato masher, then mash through the 
colander into a saucepan, put it on the stove and let 
it cook until the squash is quite dry, taking care that

Salads* 

MAYONNAISE DRESSING. 

One-half teaspoonful of mustard, one-half tea- 
spoonful of sugar, one teaspoonful of salt and a dash 
of cayenne pepper ; then add two raw egg yolks, 
beat well and stir in a teaspoonful of strong vinegar; 
add very carefully, drop by drop, a scant three-quar- 
ters of a cup of best olive oil, and as it thickens half 
a teaspoonful of vinegar. This recipe never fails, if 
the directions are carefully followed. The eggs and 
oil should be kept in the refrigerator and be ice cold. 
Lemon juice may be used, instead of vinegar, if pre- 
ferred. 

CREAM SALAD DRESSING. 

One-quarter of a cup of strong cider vinegar, one 
cup and a quarter of water, one-half cup of butter , 
one teaspoonful of mustard, one teaspoonful of salt, 
onetablespoonful, slightly heaping, of corn starch, one 
teaspoonful of sugar, a dash of cayenne pepper and 
the yolks of four eggs. Put the vinegar and water 
in a saucepan and when it boils add the butter. Beat 
the yolks of eggs and the other ingredients together 
with an egg-beater, making it quite foamy and light ; 
pour the boiling vinegar and water upon this mix- 
ture, which will partially thicken . The bowl in which 
it is mixed should be placed in a pan of hot water on 
the stove, beating it all the time with the egg-beater. 
Just before it reaches the boiling point remove and 
turn it out into a cold bowl, beating hard for a few 
minutes. When perfectly cold pour it into a glass 
jar, fasten down the top and keep in refrigerator. 

86 



FRENCH DRESSING. 

One tablespoonful of vinegar, three tablespoon- 
fuls of olive oil, a saltspoonful of salt and one of 
white pepper, and a few drops of any good sauce. 
Lettuce should be well washed in very cold water, 
leaf by leaf, and drained in a basket, which comes for 
the purpose, then placed on the ice, and at serving 
time put into the salad bowl. Lettuce should never 
be cut with a knife, but torn with a fork and spoon, 
and it should not be allowed to stand after the dress- 
ing is poured over it. 

TOMATO ICE SALAD. 

Put a quart can of tomatoes in a saucepan over 
the fire with half an onion, a slice of green pepper, if 
convenient, three cloves, two bay leaves, a sprig of 
parsley, a teaspoonful of sugar, and pepper and salt 
to taste. Cook until the onion is tender about ten 
minutes remove from the fire, press through a sieve 
fine enough to retain the seeds. When cold freeze as 
water-ice and mould a melon mould is very pretty 
for it pack in salt and ice in the usual way ; turn it 
out in a nest of crisp young lettuce and serve with a 
mayonnaise dressing in a sauceboat. 

* TOMATO JELLY. 

One can of tomatoes put on to heat in a granite 
or porcelain-lined saucepan with a large slice of onion, 
one clove, two bay leaves, a teaspoonful of chopped 
green pepper, salt to taste and a little sugar. Soak 
half a box of gelatine in a little water for half an 

*We have as yet in this country no substitute for animal gelatine. I 
have experimented with carrageen or Irish moss and the Sea-moss 
Farine preparation, and find them unsatisfactory. It is impossible 
to make a clear jelly with them, and by soaking in 'water to destroy the 
sea flavor, the solidifying property is lost. In England they have a vege- 
table gelatine (Agar Agar) which makes, I am told, a clear, sparkling 
jelly, and is said not to be expensive. I trust that before many months 
it may be obtainable here. I have ventured, therefore, to give a few 
recipes where gelatine is used, knowing that there \vill be something to 
replace it. Groult's tapioca and potato flour are said to be unadulter- 
ated, and with fresh fruit juices make nice and wholesome desserts, espe- 
cially for children. These preparations are made in France, and put up 
in half-pound packages, and sold by all of our leading grocers.

hour, and after the tomatoes have simmered fifteen 
minutes let them come to a boil and pour over the 
gelatine to dissolve it; strain through a very fine 
sieve into a bowl, let it get perfectly cold, and when 
it begins to thicken stir well and turn into an earth- 
enware mould. It looks prettier in a round one. Set 
on ice. Serve the jelly on a round dish in a bed of 
fresh, crisp young lettuce leaves, and place a spoonful 
of tender, finely-cut celery in each leaf, and pour may- 
onnaise around it. The jelly is better made the day 
before it is needed. 

SPAGHETTINA AND CELERY SALAD* 
Take some cold boiled spaghettina, chop not 
too fine and cover with a French dressing, and let 
it stand on the ice until serving time. Have an equal 
quantity of fresh, crisp celery cut fine, mix -with the 
spaghettina, cover with a mayonnaise dressing and 
garnish with tender lettuce leaves. 

SALAD OF FAIRY RINGS AND PUFF BALL MUSHROOMS. 
Have both very fresh ; cook the fairy rings until 
tender, set aside to get cold, then put on the ice. 
Take an equal quantity of puff ball raw, chop fine, 
mix with the rings, turn into a nest of tender young 
lettuce, cover with a mayonnaise dressing and serve. 

SALAD OF FRESH FRUIT. 

Peel and cut into dice enough fruit, peaches, tart 
plums, orange and banana to fill a cup and a cupful 
of crisp celery cut fine ; have both ice cold ; at serving 
time mix and cover with a cream dressing and gar- 
nish with celery tops. 

* CUCUMBER JELLY. 

Half a box of gelatine soaked for an hour in half 
a cup of cold water. Remove the seeds from a small 

*This jelly may be colored a delicate green by using extract of 
spinach (see recipe, page 164). Its appearance is much improved 
thereby.

green pepper, peel and cut into slices two large, fine, 
fresh cucumbers, or three small ones and a small 
white onion. Put in a saucepan, add a bay leaf and 
a bouquet of parsley, cover with boiling water and 
cook until tender ; remove the parsley and bay leaf, 
add a saltspoonful of sugar, salt to taste more than 
a teaspoonful will be required and press through a 
fine sieve. There should be, when strained, two cups 
and a half. Pour it over the soaked gelatine if it is 
not hot enough to dissolve the gelatine place the 
saucepan over the fire for a moment then run it 
through the same sieve again ; set aside in a bowl to 
cool. When perfectly cold and beginning to congeal, 
stir it well and pour into a pretty, round mould ; set 
it on ice until ready to serve. Turn it out on a plate 
and arrange fresh, crisp, young lettuce leaves around 
it, into each of which put a spoonful of mayonnaise 
or cream dressing. 

WALNUT AND CELERY SALAD, 
Three cupfuls of fresh, crisp celery cut fine and 
two cupfuls of walnuts, carefully shelled that they 
maybe as little broken as possible. Put the walnuts 
in a saucepan with a small onion sliced, a bay leaf, a 
clove and twelve pepper corns, cover with boiling 
water, let them cook for ten or fifteen minutes, re- 
move from the fire, drain and throw the nuts into 
cold water, remove the skins and let them get cold ; 
then set on the ice until it is time to serve. Mix them 
with the celery, add mayonnaise or cream dressing, 
put on a dish or in a salad bowl, garnish with the 
tender green celery leaves and serve. 

PINEAPPLE AND CELERY SALAD. 
Equal parts of celery and shredded pineapple. 
Have the celery of the very tenderest, using only the 
best of the heads. Select a perfectly ripe, fresh pine- 
apple, pare it, removing the eyes carefully, and shred 

89 



the fruit with a silver fork and cut into small pieces 
with a silver fruit knife ; put the celery, cut fine, and 
the shredded pineapple, each by itself on the ice, that 
they may be very cold. When it is time to serve the 
salad, mix them together, put on the salad dish, 
cover with mayonnaise dressing, garnish with the 
green celery leaves and serve at once. 

FRUIT SALAD, 

Equal quantities of grape fruit or oranges, bana- 
nas, apples and celery. Peel the grape fruit or 
oranges, carefully removing all the bitter white skin, 
cut the pulp, the bananas and apples into small dice 
and the celery fine as for other salads ; put the 
orange and apple together; the latter will absorb 
the juice of the orange. Set all on ice; these 
fruit salads must be ice cold. When it is time to 
serve, mix the fruit and celery together, put into a 
salad bowl, cover with the cream dressing into 
"which has been stirred a third as much whipped 
cream as there is dressing, and add a little more salt 
to it in mixing. Serve in a bed of tender lettuce 
leaves. 

POTATO SALAD. 

Prepare equal parts of cold boiled potatoes and 
fresh, crisp celery, cut in small pieces which will look 
attractive when mixed with the dressing ; cut in dice 
four cold, hard boiled eggs, and mix them in lightly 
with the potato and celery when adding the dress- 
ing. Use mayonnaise or cream dressing with this 
salad, garnish with dainty celery tops and serve. 

SALAD OF TOMATOES STUFFED WITH CELERY. 

Select nice, smooth, firm tomatoes, one for each 
person ; blanch them in the usual way, cut a slice from 
the stem end and remove the core and some of the 
seeds ; set on the ice to get cold. Prepare some celery, 
shredding it fine and using only the very tender part ; 

90 



mix it with mayonnaise dressing, stuff the tomatoes, 
allowing the celery to come above the top, serve 
each in a leaf or two of crisp lettuce and pour some 
mayonnaise around them. Salads should be ice cold. 

CELERIAC AND LETTUCE SALAD. 
Boil two or three celery roots in water with a 
little salt until tender ; drain and let them get cold. 
Cut them in thin slices, make a nest of crisp lettuce 
and put the celery slices in the center. Serve with a 
French dressing. 

RAW JERUSALEM ARTICHOKES AND LETTUCE SALAD. 
Wash and peel the artichokes, cut in very thin 
slices and put into an earthen bowl with vinegar and 
water with a lump of ice in it. The vinegar will pre- 
vent them from turning dark. When ready to serve, 
place in the center of nice, fresh lettuce and serve 
with a French dressing. 

SALAD A LA MACEDOINE. 

Take several kinds of cold boiled vegetables in 
equal quantities, such as green peas, string beans, 
flowerettes of cauliflower, asparagus points, a small 
potato and a French carrot cut in small dice, and a 
little green pepper if liked ; mix together and serve in 
a nest of fresh, crisp lettuce with a French dressing, 
or mayonnaise, if preferred. 

ASPARAGUS SALAD. 

Select very tender asparagus, cut off all the 
woody part and boil until tender, set aside to get 
cold, and then put on ice until serving time ; arrange 
nicely on a platter or individual plates and serve 
with either mayonnaise or French dressing.

Peel and cut in very thin slices, lay in a bowl, 
cover with water, sprinkle a little salt over them 
and put a lump of ice on top, let them remain until 

91 



serving time, drain off the water and serve in a glass 
dish with a French dressing. They should be very 
cold and crisp. A little green pepper, chopped very 
fine, is an addition; also to rub the spoon used in 
mixing with a clove of garlic gives a piquancy to the 

salad. 

COLD SLAW. 

Select a firm cabbage and shave very fine on a 
cutter that comes for this purpose. Use the cream 
dressing or French dressing with a little dry mustard 

added. 

TOMATO SALAD. 

The tomatoes should be blanched in the usual 
way, and either sliced or cut in dice or served whole ; 
or they may be cut in quarters, not quite separating 
them, and arranged in a bed of lettuce with a spoon- 
ful of mayonnaise on top of each tomato and the let- 
tuce garnished with the same. 
ENDIVE 

is excellent with French dressing. 
EGG SALAD. 

Boil three eggs hard, cut in half lengthwise, re- 
move the yolks and mash fine. Mix together in a 
saucepan the third of a teaspoonful each of dry mus- 
tard, salt and white pepper, a saltspoonful of curry 
powder, a few drops of onion juice, a teaspoonful of 
vinegar, two tablespoonfuls of egg well beaten, two 
teaspoonfuls of olive oil and a tablespoonful of rich 
cream. Put the ingredients together in the order in 
which they are named, beat well, set the bowl over 
the steam of the kettle and stir constantly until 
thick and creamy ; remove and stir in the mashed 
egg yolks, a little at a time, and set on the ice to get 
very cold. To serve, fill the whites of egg, dividing 
the mixture among them, put each half egg on two 
or three leaves of tender lettuce, with mayonnaise 
dressing around them.

97 



ted sugar and the juice of a lemon, stew gently over a 
moderate fire. When done arrange them nicely on 
a dish, melt a generous tablespoonful of currant jelly

half a glass of Madeira or sherry ; pour over the 
apples and serve. 

TO STEAM APPLES* 

Pare and core some good cooking apples, place 
them in an earthen or granite ware dish that fits in 
a steamer. Have water boiling in the steamer, set 
the dish over it, stretch a towel over the top, put on 
the cover and fold the ends of the towel over it. 
Steam the apples until tender about twenty min- 
utes. Take the apples out, measure the juice in the 
pan and add to it an equal quantity of sugar, flavor 
with a little lemon juice, cook until thick, put the 
apples in a glass dish and pour the syrup over them. 
It will be a jelly when cold. Serve with cream. 

SCALLOPED APPLES, 

Pare, core and cut in slices some good, tart cook- 
ing apples, put a layer in a baking dish with sugar, 
cinnamon and a grating of lemon rind, dot with tiny 
lumps of butter, then another layer of apples, sugar, 
etc., and so on until the dish is full. Add a very little 
water and the juice of a lemon, and use a little more 
sugar and butter on top than on the other layers. 
Bake until the apples are thoroughly cooked. Cover 
until nearly done, when the cover should be removed 
to allow them to brown. Serve hot with cream or 

hard sauce. 

BANANA FRITTERS, 

Half a pint of sweet milk, a scant half pint of 
flour, two rounded teaspoonfuls of baking powder 
and a small pinch of salt, stir all together; this 
should make a batter as thick as that of cake. Roll 
the pieces of fruit in it with a fork, and drop quickly 

98 



into boiling fat. The batter should be prepared just 
as it is wanted and not allowed to stand. Cut three 
medium-sized bananas into three pieces each and 
divide each slice lengthwise so that the fruit will be 
thin enough to cook thoroughly while the batter is 
browning. This recipe will make eighteen small frit- 
ters. Put them on a hot platter do not pile up 
and serve immediately with a fruit sauce. 

BAVARIAN CHERRY CAKE. 

Half a pound of fine, juicy black cherries, five 
tablespoonfuls of fine bread crumbs, five tablespoon- 
fuls of powdered sugar, five eggs and one ounce of

tablespoonful of bread crumbs and one of sugar, beat 
light and break another egg into it, adding another 
tablespoonful of bread crumbs and one of sugar. 
Then separate the three remaining eggs, the yolks 
from the whites, adding one yolk at a time alter- 
nately with bread crumbs and sugar until all are 
used. Add the cherries. Beat the three whites of 
eggs to a stiff froth and fold it in lightly. Butter 
thick a cake mould, sift dried bread crumbs over it, 
turn the cake into it and bake about three-quarters 
of an hour in a moderate oven. Test it as other cake. 
In Bavaria it is served cold, but I think it would also 
be nice hot with fruit sauce. 

CRANBERRY BAVARIAN CREAM. 
Stew one quart of cranberries; while hot rub 
through a sieve ; measure out half a pint, and add 
to it a half cup of granulated sugar. Have a quarter 
of a box of gelatine soaked in a quarter of a cup of 
water one hour, set the bowl over steam entirely to 
dissolve the gelatine, then add the cranberries. Turn 
it into an earthenware bowl, set in a pan of ice 
water and beat until it is perfectly cold and begins 

99 



to thicken, then add half a cup of rich milk and beat 
again, and at the last add half a cup of whipped 
cream. Beat it thoroughly and turn it into a mould 
and set on the ice to congeal. Serve with cream. 
Do not use a tin mould for cranberries.

white, bitter skin, cut in thin slices and put a layer at 
the bottom of a glass dish, sprinkle with sugar, then

bananas, cut in thin slices, and repeat, beginning 
again with oranges, until the bowl is full, finishing 
with a layer of cocoanut. Pour over it any juice 
that may have run from the oranges, and if liked a 
glass or two of sherry may be added. Serve very 

cold. 

GOOSEBERRY PUDDING. 

Use either ripe or unripe English gooseberries for 
this pudding, stem and pick off the flower, wash and

quarters of a cup of granulated sugar to it, flavor 
with a few drops of almond extract, spread over the

sugar if necessary. Rinse a plain mould in cold 
water, pour the custard into it, set the mould in a

no 



watery. It must be served ice cold and may be pre- 
pared the day before. Serve with cream or soft 
boiled custard. 

CHOCOLATE PUDDING.

and the syrup is a rich golden brown. Do not let it 
get too dark or it will be bitter. When the milk is at 
the boiling point stir in half the boiling syrup if put 
in too fast the milk will boil over. Let it cook until 
the sugar (if it hardened as it touched the milk) dis- 

111 



solves. Have four eggs beaten very light in a bowl, 
pour the milk over them, add a little salt, and if 
vanilla bean is not used for flavoring, stir in extract 
of vanilla to taste. Rinse a mould with cold water, 
pour the custard into it and set it in a pan of hot 
water in the oven, bake from twenty to twenty-five 
minutes and test with a knife. If it comes out clean 
it is done. Add boiling water to the remainder of

point drop the whites of eggs into it by tablespoon- 
fuls in egg-shape, turn them over in the hot milk for 
a few seconds, repeat until all are done, drain them 
and return the milk to the saucepan. Beat the six 
egg yolks to a light cream, turn the hot milk over it 
gradually and pour the custard back into the boiler ; 
return to the fire and stir vigorously until it thickens 
and is smooth to the taste. Remove from the fire, 
pour at once into a bowl, add a little salt, and set 
aside to cool. Then put on the ice and at serving 
time turn into a glass bowl, arrange the whites of 
eggs on top and serve with sponge cake. 

A SIMPLE DESSERT. 

A loaf of stale sponge cake one that has been 
baked in a border mould looks pretty. Saturate the 
cake with orange juice to which has been added a

bottom of the pan without being thicker than paper, 
let it brown, turning it to brown the other side, 
spread with any jelly preferred, fold in half and fold

water in the oven, cover to prevent browning and 
bake about three-quarters of an hour. Serve hot

Cakes. 

CAKE MAKING. 

Have all the ingredients measured or weighed, 
the pans lined with paper or oiled, the nuts or fruit 
prepared, and the flour sifted before beginning to 
make a cake. Sift the baking powder and cream of 
tartar and soda with the flour or a part of it. Use 
pastry flour for all cake. Never put all the milk into 
a cake batter by itself, as it curdles and makes a 
coarse grained cake, but stir it in alternately with 
the flour. Put all loaves of cake into a moderate 
oven, that they may rise before beginning to bake. 
After the cake rises the heat may be increased. 

ANGEL CAKE. 

The whites of nine large, fresh eggs. When they

into the whites of the eggs, and add a teaspoonful of 
vanilla. Have flour sifted five times, measure a cup- 
ful and fold it in very carefully, not with a circular 
motion, and do not stir long. Turn it into a Turk's 
head mould and bake forty-five minutes. Do not 
grease the mould, and when taken out of the oven 
invert it until the cake is cold before removing from 
the pan. Never use a patent egg-beater for this cake, 
but a whip, taking long, rapid strokes, and make it 
in a large platter, not a bowl.

pinch of salt, three heaping teaspoonfuls of granu- 
lated sugar, two tablespoonfuls of lemon juice, four 
tablespoonfuls of ice water and the yolks of two 
eggs. This quantity will make two pies. Rub the

teaspoonful of cream of tartar. Flavor with vanilla. 
Put all the ingredients together and boil until it is 
brittle in water ; flavor and pour into buttered tins 
and mark in squares before it is quite cold. 

CHOCOLATE CARAMELS. No. 2. 
One pint of fresh milk, three ounces of chocolate, 
grated, two pounds of granulated sugar, half a tea- 
spoonful of cream of tartar. Stir until melted, then 
add half a pint of cream, cook until the mixture is

A quarter of a pound of chocolate, grated, one 
large cup of granulated sugar, one cup of milk and a 
heaping tablespoonful of butter, a quarter of a tea- 
spoonful of cream of tartar. Boil all together, stir- 
ring all the time, until the syrup hardens in cold 
water, and just before taking from the fire add a tea- 
spoonful of vanilla. Beat the syrup as soon as re- 
moved from the fire, and keep it up until it is too stiff 
to beat any longer if it is beaten a minute and a 
half it will do well. Turn out of the saucepan into a 
greased pan and before it is quite cold cut in squares. 

CHOCOLATE CREAM PEPPERMINTS. 
Mix together two cups of granulated sugar and 
half a cup of cream, boil until it holds well together 

141 



in cold water, or can be rolled between the fingers, 
flavor with oil of peppermint, remove from the fire 
and stir until the cream is stiff enough to mould into 
balls. Use powdered sugar on the hands while 
moulding. Melt an ounce of chocolate and dip the 
balls, which should be as large as hazel nuts, in this, 
using a long pin for the purpose, and lay them on 
parafnne paper. Any flavoring may be used instead 
of peppermint. 

CANDY (to Pdl). 

Two cupfuls of granulated sugar, half a cup of 
water, one tablespoonful of vinegar, butter the size 
of a walnut. Boil the sugar and water without stir- 
ring until it is brittle when tried in cold water, add 
the butter and vinegar just before it is done. Flavor 
with any extract preferred, pour into buttered soup 
plates, and when cool enough to handle pull until 
white. 

CHESTNUTS GLAG& 

Skin the chestnuts and cover with cold water, let 
them cook gently until tender, when a large needle 
can be run through them easily. Drain and drop 
them in cold water. After two hours drain again 
and put them in a bowl, cover them with a rich syrup 
that has been skimmed and boiled until clear. It 
must be boiling when poured over the chestnuts. 
Cover the bowl with a heavy paper and let it stand 
for twelve hours, drain off the syrup, bring it to the 
boiling point and turn it over the chestnuts again 
and put away for another twelve hours. Repeat this 
process three times, then drain the syrup off and the 
chestnuts are ready for use. Use the large imported 
chestnuts, remove the shells and boil the nuts. The 
brown skin can then be easily removed with a pen- 
knife. They are very nice but very troublesome to 
prepare. 

142

fire and pour into a buttered pan. Mark into 
squares before it is cold, or break into irregular 
pieces. 

MARSHMALLOWS. 

Powder very fine eight ounces of gum arabic, 
dissolve it in three gills of water over a slow fire and 
strain. Simmer an ounce and a half of marshmal- 
low roots in two gills of water, for ten minutes, 
closely covered. Strain and reduce to one gill. Add 
this with half a pound of sugar to the dissolved 
gum. Boil until it becomes a thick paste, stirring 
constantly. Add the whites of four eggs beaten to a

salt, one cup of blanched and finely chopped al- 
monds or peanuts, or it may be made of mixed nuts. 
Dissolve the sugar in a spider over the fire without 
water, stirring constantly, and when entirely melted 
mix in the nuts quickly and pour at once into a well 
greased pan, and before it is cold mark in squares. 
This is very nice pounded fine in a mortar or ground 
in a mill to sprinkle over custards just before serving. 

PANOCHE (a Spanish Recipe). 

Two cups of dark brown sugar, one cup of chopped 
-walnuts, half a cup of milk, butter the size of a

gins to thicken it should be like a cream wafer 
turn out on paraffine paper, and break it or cut in 
pieces. 

PEPPERMINT DROPS. 

Two cups of granulated sugar, half a cup of cold 
water, a tiny pinch of cream of tartar. Boil ten 
minutes without stirring, let the sugar melt slowly 
that it may not burn. Add eight drops of oil of pep- 
permint while still on the fire. When removed from 
the stove beat with. an egg-beater until it falls in 
long drops, when drop quickly on paraffine paper. 

PRALINES. 

Two cups of granulated sugar, one-half cup of 
water, two cups of pecans, hickory nuts or English 
walnuts. Put the w^ater and sugar on to boil, let it 

144 



cook without stirring until it threads, remove from 
the fire and stir in the nuts until they are sugared. 
Spread on paraffine paper to cool. 

VASSAR FUDGE. 

Two cups of sugar, two squares or one ounce of

145 



Preserves* 

PRESERVE OF MIXED FRUITS. 

Five pounds of ripe currants or cherries, five 
pounds of granulated sugar, two pounds of seeded 
raisins, the pulp of six oranges cut in small pieces, 
and the rind of two oranges cut fine. Boil three- 
quarters of an hour. Grapes can be used instead of 
currants or cherries. 

RED CURRANT JAM. 

Pick the currants from the stems, weigh them, and 
allow three-quarters of a pound of white sugar to a 
pound of the fruit. Put the currants in a preserving 
kettle, mash them a little to prevent them from stick- 
ing to the kettle, and boil for fifteen minutes, then 
add the sugar and boil rapidly for ten minutes. 
Bottle and seal tight. 

RED CURRANT JELLY. 

Berries for jelly must be picked when the weather 
is dry. Pick them over, taking out all leaves, etc., 
put them in the kettle and mash them a little to get 
enough juice to keep them from burning; stir con- 
stantly, and as soon as hot wring them dry through 
a cheese cloth. Measure the liquid and to every pint 
of juice allow one pound of sugar. Put the juice on 
the fire and boil fifteen minutes, then add the sugar 
and boil fifteen minutes more, skimming thoroughly. 
Pour into glasses while hot ; let them stand until the 
next day and cover. Very often jelly is soft, and 
always from one of two reasons : either the berries 
have been picked immediately after a rain or the 
sugar is adulterated. 



146 



RED CURRANT SYRUP. 

The currants must be fresh and perfectly ripe and 
picked in dry weather. Wash and put them in either 
a porcelain-lined or a granite- ware kettle, stir until 
they are tender, as for currant jelly, then remove from 
the fire and wring them as dry as possible in a cheese 
cloth. Measure the juice and return it to the fire, let 
it cook fifteen minutes, then add a pound of granu- 
lated sugar to each quart of juice, boil gently fifteen 
minutes, skimming as long as the scum rises. Bottle 
and cork well and keep in a dark place. Raspberry 
and strawberry syrup are made in the same way, 
only mashing and straining the fruit and measuring 
the juice before cooking. 

BLACK CURRANT SYRUP. 

Pick from the stems and mash them, a few at a 
time, in a bowl or granite saucepan with a potato 
masher, then put them in a stone jar and let then? 
stand for two days, stirring well each day. Wrinjy 
them through a cheese cloth, and if wanted sweet 
cook with sugar as red currant syrup. The juice can 
be bottled without sugar or cooking, and will keep 
for years. It is used for sauces or fruit soups, etc. 

CRANBERRY JAM. 

Put five quarts of cranberries in a preserving 
kettle with two quarts of water and boil gently until 
the fruit is tender, then add three pounds and three- 
quarters of granulated sugar, boil until the fruit is 
clear, skimming carefully. Put in glasses and -when 
cold seal. It keeps well. 

GOOSEBERRY JELLY. 

Use the large English gooseberries and follow 
directions for currant jelly. 

147 



GOOSEBERRY JAM. 

Three-quarters of a pound of sugar to every 
pound of fruit. Put the fruit on by itself in a porce- 
lain-lined or granite-ware saucepan, mash and stir 
well to keep from burning, and boil one hour. Then 
add the sugar and boil one hour more. 

GRAPE JAM* 

Press with the fingers the pulp from grapes 
Muscat or Concord grapes make the best jam seed 
and measure them, allowing a cup of sugar to each 
cup of fruit. Put the skins on and cook until tender, 
when almost done add the pulp, and when all is ten- 
der add the sugar and boil until thick. 

PINEAPPLE JAM. 

Pare the fruit and carefully take out the eyes, 
then grate it on a coarse grater, rejecting the cores, 
weigh it, and to each pound of fruit take a pound of 
sugar. Sprinkle it over the grated pines, let it stand 
over night. In the morning, boil for ten or fifteen 
minutes over a quick fire. Put in tumblers and when 
cold cover. 

RASPBERRY OR STRAWBERRY JAM. 
Allow three-quarters of a pound of sugar to a 
pound of fruit. Put the fruit in a preserving kettle 
over the fire and boil fifteen minutes, mashing a little 
to prevent sticking to the kettle. Then add the sugar 
and boil ten minutes, skimming carefully ; turn into 
glasses and seal when cold. 

ORANGE MARMALADE. 

Select smooth, thin-skinned, juicy oranges. Take 
twenty-one, and five lemons. Cut the rind very thin 
from a third of the fruit, and boil it in two quarts of 
water until it can be pierced easily with a broom 
straw. Drain from the water and cut in fine strips 

148 



"with scissors, add this to the pulp of the oranges and 
lemons after removing all the white bitter skin and 
pips from the fruit. Weigh and allow a pound of 
sugar to a pound of fruit, put in a porcelain-lined or 
granite-ware kettle and cook until clear. Put in 
glasses and when cold cover with brandied paper 
and seal. 

PUMPKIN CHIPS. 

Slice very thin and chip about four pounds of 
pumpkin, put in an earthenware bowl, and cover it 
over night with four and a half pounds of granulated 
sugar and the juice of one dozen lemons. Boil the 
lemon peel until tender and cut in small thin chips 
and add to the juice, etc. In the morning, boil to- 
gether until perfectly clear and crisp. 




149 



Pickles, Sauces, etc. 



RIPE CUCUMBER PICKLE. 

Pare and seed the cucumbers. Slice each cucum- 
ber lengthwise in four pieces or cut it in fancy shapes, 
cover with cold vinegar and let them stand for twen- 
ty-four hours. Drain and put them in fresh vinegar 
-with two pounds of sugar, and one ounce of cassia 
buds to one quart of vinegar. Boil for twenty min- 
utes and put in jars. 

SWEET PICKLED PEACHES. 

Select fine, fresh, ripe, but not soft peaches, peel 
and weigh them. To every seven pounds of fruit take 
five pounds of granulated sugar, a pint of vinegar, 
two tablespoonfuls of cinnamon and one tablespoon- 
ful of cloves, tie the spices up in a muslin bag, add a 
few pieces of stick cinnamon and a few allspice. Put 
the fruit in a stone jar, bring the sugar, vinegar and 
spice to a boil, pour over the peaches, cover and let 
them stand until the next day, scald the syrup again 
and pour over the fruit, and so on, until it has been 
done in all seven times. Take out the bag of spice 
and put the fruit with the syrup into jars and seal. 
These are much more delicious than peaches that are 

cooked, 

SWEET PICKLED PLUMS.

put in the onions and peppers chopped, boil together 
four hours, stir constantly the last hour to prevent 
burning, then add the other ingredients and simmer 
long enough thoroughly to mix them. Put the sauce 
in small bottles, cork tight and seal and keep in a 
dark place.

white onions chopped fine, two cups of best wine or 
cider vinegar, one cup of sugar, two tablespoonfuls 
of salt, two even teaspoonfuls of ground mace, two 
teaspoonfuls of nutmeg, two teaspoonfuls of cloves, 
one teaspoonful of celery seed. Boil an hour and 
bottle while hot. Very nice to serve with baked 

beans. 

MUSTARD PICKLES. 

One quart each of tiny whole cucumbers, large 
cucumbers sliced, green tomatoes sliced and small 
button onions, one large cauliflower divided into 
flowerettes, and four green peppers cut fine. Make a 
brine of four quarts of water and one pint of salt, 
pour it over the mixed vegetables and let it stand 
covered twenty-four hours. Then scald it and turn 
into a colander to drain. Mix one cup of flour, six 

151 



tablespoonfuls of mustard, and one tablespoonful of 
turmeric with enough vinegar to make a smooth 
paste, add one cup of granulated sugar and sufficient 
vinegar to make two quarts in all. Boil this mix- 
ture until it is thick and smooth, stirring constantly, 
then add the vegetables and heat them through. 

RIPE TOMATO PICKLE. 

A peck of perfectly ripe tomatoes, two quarts of 
fine cooking salt, half a pound of ground mustard, 
one ounce of cloves, two green peppers, two or three 
onions and one pound of brown sugar. Pierce the 
tomatoes with a silver fork or broom straw, put 
them in a stone jar with salt in alternate layers. 
Throw away all the liquor made by standing one 
week. Return to jar and cover with cold \vater, 
cover and let it stand twenty-four hours. Drain 
again thoroughly, throw away the water, return the 
tomatoes to the jar and cover with cold vinegar, 
having added to the fruit, the onions and peppers

and sprinkle the mustard seeds over all. Tie the 
spices in a thin muslin bag and cover the whole with 

152 



best wine vinegar, boil until tender and clear in ap- 
pearance. The peppers should have all the seeds 
removed. Half a cup of dry mustard is considered 
by some an improvement. 

GOOSEBERRY CATSUP.

squeeze the fruit, but drain as dry as possible by 
lightly pressing it. The last time strain it through 
muslin previously wet with vinegar to prevent 
waste. Put into a preserving kettle with a pound 
of sugar to every pint of juice. Stir until the sugar 
is melted and let it cook gently for five minutes, skim 
it. When cold, bottle and cork well. 




153

FRUIT SAUCE. 

Put a cupful of granulated sugar in a saucepan, 
pour over it two and a half cupfuls of boiling water, 
let it boil a few minutes, then add two heaping table- 
spoonfuls of butter, two even teaspoonfuls of corn- 
starch rubbed to a paste with a little cold water, then

a cup of granulated sugar in a saucepan with one cup 
of boiling water, add the banana pulp to it, let it 
come to a boil, and skim if necessary. Rub a heaping 
tablespoonful of butter with half a tablespoonful of 
flour, stir into it a little of the liquid, and then add to 
that in the saucepan; add the juice and grated rind of 
half a lemon, and it is ready to serve. 

FOAMING SAUCE. 

Beat to a cream a cup of sugar and a quarter of 
a cup of butter, and add to it two tablespoonfuls of 

154 



wine or fruit juice, or in winter fruit syrup. If the 
latter, use only three-quarters of a cup of sugar. At 
serving time add a quarter of a cup of boiling water, 
stir well, then add the white of an egg beaten to a 
stiff froth. Beat until the sauce foams. 

HARD SAUCE. 

Cream one tablespoonful of butter, stir in four 
tablespoonfuls of po wdered sugar and beat until very 
light, then add a teaspoonful of boiling water and 
beat again. Flavor to suit taste. 

SOUTHERN SAUCE. 

Beat four tablespoonfuls of brown sugar with

155 



Savory Sauces* 



In making sauces great care should be taken to 
have the saucepans scrupulously clean and only 
granite-ware or porcelain-lined saucepans should be 
used, especially where there is any acid as in toma- 
toes or pickles. Never use an iron spider except for 
browning butter and flour together as they will not 
brown in a saucepan. 

VEGETABLE STOCK FOR SAUCES. 
Take any kinds of vegetables convenient, such as 
parsnips, celery, carrots, turnips, green pepper, onion, 
leek, parsley, celery tops, celery root, Jerusalem arti- 
chokes, a bay leaf, two cloves, two allspice, and cook 
in water until tender; strain, pressing all from the 
vegetables. The water Jerusalem artichokes are 
boiled in is valuable for sauces. The liquid from 
canned peas is also excellent. Care must be taken in 
putting the vegetables together not to let any one 
predominate, turnip especially, as it makes a sauce 
very bitter. 

COLORING FOR SAUCES, SOUPS, Etc. 
Melt a quarter of a pound of granulated sugar in 
a spider, cook until it is a very dark, rich brown, 
almost black, stir constantly. Great care must be 
taken that it does not burn. When done pour over 
it a quart of boiling water and let it cook until the 
caramel is entirely dissolved, pour it out and when 
cold strain and bottle. It will keep indefinitely and 
a tablespoonful will give color to a pint of liquid. 

OLIVE SAUCE. 

Melt a heaping tablespoonful of butter in a 
spider and when it begins to brown stir into it a 

156 



heaping tablespoonful of flour, let it cook until a 
very dark brown, but be careful not to let it burn, 
then add enough rich vegetable stock to make a 
thick cream-like sauce. Have ready some olives six 
or seven, that have been boiled a few minutes in 
water and cut from the stones, add these to the 
sauce, season with pepper and salt to taste, bring to 
the boiling point and serve. 

SAUCE HOLLANDAISE. 

One-quarter of a pound of butter, one-quarter of 
a cup of water, one-quarter of a teaspoonful of salt, 
the juice of a quarter of a lemon, a dash of cayenne, 
and the yolks of three eggs. Beat the butter to a 
cream and stir in the yolks of eggs, one at a time, 
then the lemon juice, salt and pepper. Set the bowl 
it is mixed in in a pan of boiling water on the fire, 
beating constantly with an egg beater, and when it 
begins to thicken stir in gradually the boiling water. 
When it is as thick as soft custard it is done. Great 
care must be taken not to let it remain too long on 
the fire or it will curdle. 

DRAWN BUTTER OR CREAM SAUCE* 

Melt a large heaping tablespoonful of butter and 
stir into it a heaping teaspoonful of flour, let them 
cook together without browning and add by degrees 
a cup of hot milk. 

CURRY SAUCE. 

Curry sauce is made by adding curry powder to 
taste to a white sauce. It may likewise be added to 
a brown sauce. 

CHEESE SAUCE. 

A white or cream sauce with grated Parmesan 
cheese added to taste. 

157 



TOMATO SAUCE. 

Melt a large tablespoonful of butter in a saucepan 
over the fire, when it bubbles put into it a small onion 
and half a green pepper, if convenient, chopped very 
fine. Simmer gently for a few minutes, then stir in a 
heaping teaspoonful of flour, and add four nice, fresh 
tomatoes peeled and cut small canned tomatoes 
may be used a gill of vegetable stock, a clove and 
part of a bay leaf, and pepper and salt to taste. Let 
it cook gently for half an hour and press through a 

fine sieve. 

SAUCE TART ARE 

may be made by beating a small tablespoonful of 
butter to a cream, adding salt, pepper, dry mustard 
and sugar to taste and the raw yolk of an egg. Add 
a tablespoonful of olives, small cucumbers and capers 
chopped very fine and a few drops of onion juice. 
Serve with mock fish cutlets and croquettes. 

SAUCE PIQUANTE. 

Melt a heaping tablespoonful of butter in a spider 
and when it bubbles stir into it a heaping table- 
spoonful of flour, cook until it turns a dark brown, 
taking care not to let it burn, add to it enough well- 
seasoned vegetable stock to make the sauce the 
proper consistency, then pour it into a granite-ware 
saucepan and add one small cucumber pickle, two 
olives and a few capers, all chopped very fine ; season 
with salt and pepper to taste.

Sandwiches. 



CHEESE SANDWICHES. 

Half a pound of grated cheese, one tablespoonftil 
of butter, the yolks of two hard-boiled eggs mashed 
very fine and a teaspoonful of mayonnaise dressing. 
Mix the ingredients thoroughly; butter before cut- 
ting from the loaf some slices of brown or white 
home-made bread ; spread with the mixture and fold 
together. 

CELERY SANDWICHES* 

Use dainty little baking powder biscuits freshly 
baked but cold, or white home-made bread for these 
sandwiches. Only the very tender part of celery 
should be used and chopped fine and put in iced water 
until needed. Add a few chopped walnuts to the 
celery and enough mayonnaise dressing to hold them 
together; butter the bread before cutting from the 
loaf, spread one slice with the mixture and press an- 
other over it. If biscuits are used, split and butter 
them. They should be small and very thin for this 
purpose and browned delicately. 

NUT AND CREAM CHEESE SANDWICHES. 

Boston brown bread buttered on the loaf and cut 
in very thin slices; spread with a filling of cream 
cheese and chopped walnut meats ; press a buttered 
slice over it. They may be cut in fingers, rounds or 
half-moons. The proportion is three-quarters of a 
cup of nuts to a ten-cent package of Philadelphia 
cream cheese. This quantity will make a large num- 
ber of sandwiches. 

159 



NUT SANDWICHES. 

Graham, rye, and Boston brown bread make very 
nice sandwiches. Butter the loaf and cut in very thin 
slices, sprinkle with chopped nuts and fold together. 

WHOLE WHEAT BREAD AND PEANUT SANDWICHES. 

Chop the nuts very fine, butter the bread before 
cutting from the loaf, sprinkle the nuts thickly over 
the butter, press two slices together. Boston brown 
bread with raisins is also nice for these sandwiches. 

OLIVE SANDWICHES. 

Prepare the bread and butter as for other sand- 
wiches. It may be cut in squares, rounds or tri- 
angles to suit the fancy. Stone and chop as many 
Queen olives as needed and mix with them enough 
mayonnaise dressing to hold together, spread half 
the number of bread slices with the mixture and 
cover with the other half. 

Brown, rye, whole wheat or white bread may be 
used. Home-made is preferable, but it must be 
twelve hours old. Sandwiches may be sweet or sa- 
vory, may be cut round, square, or in triangles.

Sundries. 

CRACKERS AND CHEESE TOASTED. 
Butter some zepherettes and sprinkle thickly with 
grated Parmesan cheese, bake in a quick oven, or 
toast on a gridiron; serve hot. 

CRACKERS WITH CREAM CHEESE AND GUAVA JELLY. 
Spread zepherettes with cream cheese and dot 
with Guava jelly. 

WELSH RAREBIT. 

Half a pound of American cheese, two butter 
balls, two eggs, half a teaspoonful of mustard, a salt- 
spoonful of salt, a dash of cayenne pepper, half a cup 
of milk and an even saltspoonful of soda. Cut the 
cheese fine, melt the butter in a chafing dish or spider, 
stir the mustard, salt and pepper with it, then add 
the cheese and milk ; when the cheese is dissolved add 
the eggs slightly beaten and stir until it thickens. 
Serve on toast. 

CHEESE SOUFFLE. 

Melt one tablespoonful of butter in a spider, add 
to it a slightly heaping tablespoonful of flour and one 
cup of hot milk, half a teaspoonful of salt, a dash of 
cayenne pepper and one cup of grated Parmesan 
cheese ; then add the yolks of three eggs beaten light, 
remove from the fire and let it cool; then add the 
whites of eggs beaten stiff, turn into a pudding dish, 
bake twenty -five minutes and serve immediately. 

CHEESE STRAWS. 

Take two ounces of flour and three ounces of 
Parmesan cheese grated (it is better to buy the cheese 
by the pound and have it grated at home), and twb 

161 



ounces of butter. Rub the butter into the flour, add 
the cheese and a little salt and cayenne pepper, and 
make into a paste with the yolk of an egg ; roll the 
paste out in a sheet about an eighth of an inch thick 
and five inches wide and cut in narrow strips ; bake 
in a hot oven about ten minutes. 

PATE A CHOU FOR SOUPS, 

Put a gill of milk and an ounce of butter into a 
saucepan over the fire ; when it comes to the boiling 
point add two ounces of sifted flour; stir with a 
wooden spoon until thick and smooth, then add two 
eggs, one at a time, beating briskly; remove from 
the fire and spread out thin, cut in pieces, the size of 
a small bean, put them in a sieve, dredge with flour, 
shake it well and fry in boiling fat until a nice brown. 
Add to the soup after it is in the tureen. 

A FILLING FOR PATTIES, 

Break two .eggs in a bowl, add a little salt and 
white pepper, a few drops of onion juice and four 
tablespoonfuls of cream, beat slightly; turn into a 
buttered tin cup, stand in a saucepan with a little 
boiling water in it on the stove, cover and cook until 
stiff about three or four minutes remove from the 
fire, turn out of the cup. When ready to use cut in 
half-inch slices and then into stars or any fancy shape 
preferred, or into dice. Make a cream sauce thicker 
than for other uses, that it may not run through the 
pastry ; put them in the sauce, bring to the boiling 
point and fill the patties just as they are to be served. 

GRUEL OF KERNEL FLOUR OR MIDDLINGS. 
Put a pint of boiling water in a saucepan over 
the fire ; mix two heaping teaspoonfuls of the flour 
with a little cold water and stir into the boiling 
water. Let it boil twenty minutes, add a little cream 
to it and salt. Very nutritious. 

162 



KOUMYSS. 

Dissolve a third of a cake of compressed yeast in 
a little tepid water ; take a quart of milk, fresh from 
the cow, or warmed to blood heat, and add to it a 
tablespoonful of sugar and the dissolved yeast. Put 
the mixture immediately in beer bottles with patent 
stoppers, filling to the neck, and let them stand for 
twelve hours where bread would be set to rise that 
is, in a temperature of 68 or 70 degrees then stand 
the bottles upside down on ice until wanted. 

HOME-MADE BAKING POWDER. 

Procure from a reliable druggist one-half pound 
of the best bicarbonate of soda, one pound of cream 
of tartar and one-half pound of Kingsford's corn- 
starch. Mix thoroughly and sift three times, put up 
in small tins. The best baking powder. 

VANILLA EXTRACT. 

One ounce of Mexican vanilla bean, two ounces 
of loaf sugar, eight ounces of French rose water, 
twenty-four ounces of alcohol 95 per cent. Cut up 
the bean and pound with the sugar in a mortar, sift 
and pound again until all is a fine powder. Mix the 
alcohol and rose water; put the vanilla in a paper 
filter, pour over it a little of the liquid at a time until 
all is used ; filter again if not all is dissolved. Paper 
filters may be obtained at any of the large drug 
stores. The extract may be darkened by using a 
little caramel. 

VANILLA SUGAR. 

Half a pound of loaf sugar, half an ounce of 
Mexican vanilla beans. Cut the beans very fine, 
pound in a mortar with the sugar; sift and pound 
again until all is fine. Bottle and cork tight and 
keep in a dark place. 

163 



SPINACH FOR COLORING. 

Pound some spinach in a mortar, adding a little 
water ; squeeze through a cheese cloth, put in a sauce- 
pan over the fire, bring to a boil ; when it curdles re- 
move from the stove. Strain through a very fine 
sieve ; what remains on the under part of the sieve 
is the coloring. It is used for coloring pistache ice 
cream, jellies, etc. 

TOMATO PASTE FOR SANDWICHES. 

Skin and cut small three large tomatoes, cook 
until tender and press through a sieve fine enough to 
retain the seeds ; return to the fire, add two ounces 
of butter, two ounces of grated bread crumbs and 
two ounces of grated Parmesan cheese. When it 
boils stir a beaten egg quickly into it, remove at once 
from the fire. It must not boil after the egg is added, 
as it will curdle. Turn the mixture into a bowl and 
when cold, if it is not for immediate use, cover with 
melted butter. 

CHEESE PASTE FOR SANDWICHES. 

Boil two eggs hard, separate the yolks from the 
whites, mash the yolks smooth and chop the whites 
very fine; mix and put through a vegetable press, 
then add butter the size of a small egg and three 
heaping tablespoonfuls of grated American cheese. 
Beat together until it is a fine, smooth paste. If not 
salt enough add a little, and also dry mustard, if 
liked.

Miscellaneous Recipes* 

TOOTH POWDER. 

Precipitated chalk, seven ounces; Florentine orris, 
four ounces ; bicarbonate of soda, three ounces ; pow- 
dered white Castile soap, two ounces ; thirty drops 
each of oil of wintergreen and sassafras. Sift all to- 
gether and keep in a glass jar or tin box. A very 
valuable recipe for hardening the teeth. 

JAPANESE CREAM. 

Four ounces of ammonia, four ounces of white 
Castile soap cut fine, two ounces of alcohol, two 
ounces of Price's glycerine and two ounces of ether. 
Put the soap in one quart of water over the fire; 
when dissolved add four quarts of water ; when cold 
add the other ingredients, bottle and cork tight. It 
-will keep indefinitely. It should be made of soft 
water or rain water. To wash woolens, flannels, 
etc., take a teacup of the liquid to a pail of lukewarm 
water, and rinse in another pail of water with half a 
cup of the cream. Iron while damp on the wrong 
side. For removing grass stains, paint, etc., use half 
water and half cream. 

ORANGE FLOWER LOTION FOR THE COMPLEXION. 

Dissolve a slightly heaping tablespoonful of Ep- 
som salts in a pint of imported orange flower water 
(Chiris de Grasse), and add to it one tablespoonful 
of witch hazel. Apply with a soft linen cloth. Very 
refreshing in warm weather and an excellent remedy 
for oiliness of the skin. 

BAY RUM. 

Three-quarters of an ounce of oil of bay, one 
ounce of loaf sugar, one pint of alcohol, 95 per cent., 

165 



two quarts of new New England rum and three pints 
of rectified spirits, 60 per cent. Roll the sugar until 
fine and beat into the oil of bay, add the alcohol, then 
the New England rum and spirits. Let it stand for 
several days in a demijohn, shaking occasionally; 
then filter through blotting paper. The filters may 
be purchased at a druggist's. Care should be taken 
to buy the oil at a reliable place. 

FINE LAVENDER WATER. 

Two ounces finest oil of lavender, one ounce 
essence of musk, one-half ounce essence of ambergris, 
one-half ounce oil of bergamot and one-half gallon of 
rectified spirits. Mix the ingredients, keep in a demi- 
john for several days, shaking occasionally. Then 
filter and bottle. 

GOOD HARD SOAP. 

Five pounds of grease, one quart and one cup of 
cold water, one can of potash, one heaping table- 
spoonful of borax, two tablespoonfuls of ammonia. 
Dissolve the potash in the water, then add the borax 
and ammonia and stir in the lukewarm grease slowly 
and continue to stir until it becomes as thick as thick 
honey ; then pour into a pan to harden. When firm 
cut into cakes. Grease that is no longer fit to fry in 
is used for this soap. Strain it carefully that no par- 
ticles of food are left in it. It makes no difference 
how brown the grease is, the soap will become white 
and float in water. It should be kept a month before 
using. 

POLISH FOR HARD OR STAINED WOOD FLOORS. 

Eight ounces of yellow beeswax, two quarts of 
spirits of turpentine, one quart of Venetian turpen- 
tine. Cut the wax in small pieces and pour the 
spirits over it it will soon dissolve; then bottle. 
Apply with a flannel or soft cloth. It keeps the floors 
in excellent order.

And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb hearing 
seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in 
the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed ; to you it shall be 
for meat. And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of 
the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein 
there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was 
so.— Genesis i., 29, 30. 

Thou shalt not kill. — Exodus xx., 13. 

For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; 
even one thing befalleth them : as the one dieth, so dieth the 
other ; yea, they have all one breath ; so that a man hath no pre- 
eminence above a beast : for all is vanity. All go unto one place ; 
all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again. Who knoweth the 
spirit of man that goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast that 
goeth downward to the earth? — Ecclesiastes iii., 19, 20, 21. 

He that killeth an ox is as if he slew a man. — Isaiah Ixvi., 3. 

Then said Daniel to Melzar [tAe steward'\, whom the prince 
of the eunuchs had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and 
Azariah : Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let 
them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink. Then let our 
countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenance 
of the children that eat of the portion of the king's meat: and 
as thou seest, deal with thy servants. So he consented to them 
in this matter, and proved them ten days. And at the end of 
ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh 
than all the children which did eat the portion of the king's 
meat. — Daniel i., 11 to 17. 



PPEmCE. 



I SEND this little book out into the world, first, to aid those 
who, having decided to adopt a bloodless diet, are still 
asking how they can be nourished without flesh ; second, in the 
hope of gaining something further to protect " the speechless 
ones " who, having come down through the centuries under 
" the dominion of man," have in their eyes the mute, appeal- 
ing look of the helpless and oppressed. Their eloquent silence 
should not ask our sympathy and aid in vain ; they have a 
right, as our humble brothers, to our loving care and protec- 
tion, and to demand justice and pity at our hands ; and, as a 
part of the One Life, to — 

" life, which all can take but none can give ; 

Life, which all creatures love and strive to keep ; 

Wonderful, dear, and pleasant unto each. 

Even to the meanest; yea, a boon to all 

Where pity is, for pity makes the world 

Soft to the weak and noble for the strong. 

Unto the dumb lips of the flock he lent 

Sad, pleading words, showing how man, who prays 

For mercy to the gods, is merciless, 

Being as god to those ; albeit all life 

Is linked and kin, and what we slay have given 

Meek tribute of their milk and wool, and set 

Fast trust upon the hands which murder them." 
If the cruelty and injustice to animals are nothing to us, 
we have still another argument to offer — the brutalization of 
the men who slaughter that we may eat flesh. Mrs. Besant, 
in "Why I Am a Food Reformer," says: 

" Lately I have been in the city of Chicago — one of the 
greatest slaughter-houses of the world — where the slaughter- 
men, who are employed from early morn till late at night in the 
killing of thousands of these hapless creatures, are made a class 
practically apart from their fellow-men; they are marked out 



by the police as the most dangerous part of the community; 
amongst them are committed most crimes of violence, and 
the most ready use of the knife is found. One day I was 
speaking to an authority on this subject, and I asked him how 
it was that he knew so decidedly that most of the murders and 
the crimes with the knife were perpetrated by that particular 
class of men, and his answer was suggestive, although horrible. 
He said: 'There is a peculiar turn of the knife which men 
learn to use in the slaughter-house, for, as the living creatures 
are brought to them by machinery, these men slit their throats 
as they pass by. That twist of the wrist is the characteristic 
of most crimes with the knife committed amongst our Chicago 
population.' That struck me at once as both a horrible and 
significant fact. What right have people to condemn other men 
to a trade that makes them so readily take to the knife in anger; 
which marks them out as specially brutalized — brutes amongst 
their fellow-men? Being constantly in the sight and the smell 
of blood, their whole nature is coarsened; accustomed to kill 
thousands of creatures, they lose all sense of reverence for 
sentient life, they grow indifferent to the suffering they contin- 
ually see around them ; accustomed to inflict pain, they grow 
callous to the sight of pain ; accustomed to kill swiftly, and 
sometimes not even waiting until the creature is dead before 
the skin is stripped from it, their nerves become coarsened, 
hardened, and brutalized, and they are less men as men because 
they are slaughterers of animals. And everyone who eats flesh 
meat has part in that brutalization ; everyone who uses what they 
provide is guilty of this degradation of his fellow-men. 

" If I may not appeal to you in the name of the animals — 
if under mistaken views you regard animals as not sharing your 
kind of life — then I appeal to you in the name of human brother- 
hood, and remind you of your duty to your fellow-men, your 
duty to your nation, which must be built up partly of the chil- 
dren of those who slaughter — who physically inherit the very 
signs of this brutalizing occupation. I ask you to recognize 
your duty as men and women who should raise the Race, not 

6 



degrade it ; who should try to make it divine, not brutal ; who 
should try to make it pure, not foul ; and therefore, in the 
name of Human Brotherhood, I appeal to you to leave your 
own tables free from the stain of blood and your consciences 
free from the degradation of your fellow-men." 

That flesh-eating is not necessary to the perfect health of 
man is attested by many scientists. The following testimonies 
from some very prominent physiologists and anatomists may 
prove interesting : 

Sir Charles Bell, F. R. S. : " It is, 1 think, not going too 
far to say that every fact connected with the human organiza- 
tion goes to prove that man was originally formed a frugivorous 
animal. This opinion is principally derived from the formation 
of his teeth and digestive organs, as well as from the character 
of his skin and the general structure of his limbs." 

Sylvester Graham, M. D. : " Comparative anatomy proves 
that man is naturally a frugivorous animal, formed to subsist 
upon fruits, seeds, and farinaceous vegetables." 

Professor Wm. Lawrence, F. R. S. : "The teeth of man 
have not the slightest resemblance to those of carnivorous 
animals ; and, whether we consider the teeth, jaws, or digestive 
organs, the human structure closely resembles that of the fru- 
givorous animals." 

Dr. Jozef Drzewiecki : " There is no doubt that fruit and 
vegetable food purifies the blood, while meat inflames and is 
the source of many diseases, which are the punishment for 
breaking the natural law and command." 

Professor Vogt : " The vegetarian diet is the most bene- 
ficial and agreeable to our organs, as it contains the greatest 
amount of carbon hydrates and the best proportion of albumen." 

Sir Henry Thompson, M. D., F. R. C. S. : " It is a vulgar 
error to regard meat in any form as necessary to life. All that 
is necessary to the human body can be supplied by the vegeta- 
ble kingdom. . . . The vegetarian can extract from his food 
all the principles necessary for the growth and support of the 
body, as well as for the production of heat and force. It must 



be admitted as a fact beyond all question that some persons 
are stronger and more healthy who live on that food. 1 know 
how much of the prevailing meat diet is not merely a wasteful 
extravagance, but a source of serious evil to the consumer." 

The following special cablegram from London to the New 
York " Sun," July 3d, 1898, contains a practical illustration of 
the superiority of a vegetable diet : 

" The vegetarians are making a great ado over the triumph 
of their theory in the long-distance test of walking endurance, 
seventy miles, in Germany, this week. The twenty- two starters 
included eight vegetarians. The distance had to be covered 
within eighteen hours. The first six to arrive were vegetarians, 
the first finishing in 14)4^ hours, the second in \4^, the third 
in \5}4, the fourth in 16, the fifth in \6}4< and the sixth in 
17j^. The last two vegetarians missed their way and walked 
five miles more. All reached the goal in splendid condition. 
Not till one hour after the last vegetarian did the first meat- 
eater appear, completely exhausted. He was the only one. 
Others dropped off after thirty-five miles." 

There is no question of the great economy of vegetarian- 
ism. Dr. Alcott, in " Arguments for Vegetarianism," says: 

" Twenty-two acres of land are needed to sustain one man 
on fresh meat. Under wheat that land will feed forty-two peo- 
ple ; under oats, eighty-eight ; under potatoes, maize, or rice, 
one hundred and seventy-six ; under the banana, over six thou- 
sand. The crowded nations of the future must abandon flesh- 
eating for a diet that will feed more than tenfold people by the 
same soil, expense and labor. How rich men will be when they 
cease to toil for flesh-meat, alcohol, drugs, sickness, and war !" 

"Suffer the ox to plough, and impute his death to age and Nature's 

hand. 
Let the sheep continue to yield us shehering wool, and the goats the 

produce of their loaded udders. 
Banish from among you nets and snares and painful artifices, 
Conspire no longer against the birds, nor scare the meek deer, nor hide 

with fraud ihe crooked hook ; . . . . 
But let your mouths be empty of blood, and satisfied with pure and 

natural repasts."* 

* Imputed to Pythagoras.

' Golden Age, whose light is of the dawn, 
And not of sunset, forward, not behind, 
Flood the new heavens and earth, and with thee bring 
All the old virtues, whatsoever things 
Are pure and honest and of good repute, 
But add thereto whatever bard has sung 
Or seer has told of when in trance or dream 
They saw the Happy Isles of prophecy! 
Let Justice hold her scale, and Truth divide 
Between the right and wrong ; but give the heart 
The freedom of its fair inheritance."

Bread, Biscuit, and Rolls. 

BEATEN BISCUIT.-No. J. 
One quart of flour, two teaspoonfuls of baking 
powder sifted with the flour, a quarter of a tea- 
spoonful of salt, a large heaping tablespoonful of but- 
ter, milk enough to make a stiff" dough. Beat with 
a rolling pin or in a biscuit-beater for ten or fifteen 
minutes until the dough blisters. Roll out about 
half an inch thick or less, prick well with a fork and 
bake in a quick oven. 

BEATEN BISCUIT.-No. 2. 

Two quarts of flour, three ounces of butter, a 
little salt and enough water to make a stiff dough. 
Beat with a rolling pin or in a biscuit-beater twent\^ 
minutes until the dough blisters or snaps. Roll out 
about half an inch thick, prick well with a fork and 
bake in a quick oven. This dough rolled very thin, 
cut with a large cutter, pricked well and baked in a 
quick oven makes delicious wafers to serve with tea 
or chocolate. 

BAKING-POWDER BISCUIT. 

One quart of sifted flour, three-quarters of a cup 
of butter, two heaping teaspoonfuls of baking pow- 
der, one teaspoonful of salt, enough milk to make a 
soft dough. Do not handle any more than is neces- 
sary. Roll thin, cut in small biscuits, prick with a 
fork and bake in a quick oven. 

CREAM BISCUIT. 
One quart of flour sifted, two rounded teaspoon- 
fuls of Cleveland's baking powder, two cupfuls of 



cream and a little salt. Mix, roll out about a quar- 
ter of an inch thick, cut with a small biscuit-cutter, 
prick with a fork and bake fifteen or twenty minutes 
in a quick oven. 

FRENCH ROLLS. 

Two quarts of sifted flour, a pint of warm milk, 
half a cup of butter melted in the milk, a quarter of 
a cup of sugar, three or four eggs beaten light, a little 
salt, a half cake of compressed yeast, dissolved in a 
little warm milk. Make a batter of the milk and 
flour, add the eggs and sugar, beat hard for fifteen 
minutes. Cover the pan and set to rise, over night 
if for luncheon, in the morning if for tea. Knead 
well, but do not add any more flour. Make them 
into shape and let them rise again until light. Bake 
about fifteen minutes in a quick oven. For buns add 
cinnamon. Sift the flour before measuring, and 
measure lightly. 

RAISED FINGER-ROLLS. 
Half a pint of milk, half a pint of water, one- 
third of a compressed yeast cake, one teaspoonful of 
sugar, two teaspoonfuls of butter, one teaspoonful 
of salt. Dissolve the yeast cake in a little tepid 
water, mix as usual, make into a soft dough at night, 
bake for breakfast or luncheon. 

WINDSOR ROLLS. 
Melt half a cup of butter in three-quarters of a 
pint of warm milk, dissolve one cake of compressed 
3'^east in a little tepid milk, stir together and add a 
teaspoonful of salt and enough flour to make like 
bread dough, set to rise in a w^arm place. It will rise 
in about two hours. Roll out the dough, using as 
little flour as possible to keep it froin sticking, and 
cut with a biscuit-cutter, or mould with the hands 
into rolls, put them in pans, and set on the shelf over 

14 



the range to rise about ten or fifteen minutes. Bake 
fifteen or twenty minutes. 

ELIZABETTI ROLLS. 
One cup of sweet milk, half a yeast cake, an even 
tablespoonful of butter, two teaspoonfuls of sugar, 
and one of salt, and flour enough to make as stiff as 
bread dough. Scald the milk and melt the butter in 
it, when lukewarm dissolve the j^east cake, sugar and 
salt and stir the flour in until as thick as bread 
dough. Set to rise over night. In the morning roll 
thin, cut with a biscuit-cutter, put a tiny lump of 
butter on each biscuit, fold in half, set to rise again, 
and when light bake about twenty minutes in a 
moderate oven. This quantity will make twenty- 
four rolls. 

RYE ROLLS. 

Take in the morning from rye bread dough one 
cupful, add to it a tablespoonful of Porto Rico mo- 
lasses, one tablespoonful of sour cream, one even 
tablespoonful of butter. Bake in cups, half fill them, 
set in a warm place to rise for three-quarters of an 
hour, and bake fifteen minutes. This quantity will 

make eight. 

GLUTEN ROLLS. 

Three cups of kernel flour, two even tablespoon- 
fuls of baking powder, half a teaspoonful of salt, 
two cups of milk. Mix the flour, salt and baking 
powder together, then stir in the milk, beat well. If 
baked in iron roll pans heat them well, brush with 
butter; if granite ware, only grease them. This 
quantity will make sixteen rolls. Bake from twenty 
to tw^enty-five minutes. 

PARKER HOUSE ROLLS. 
Sift two cups of flour with half a teaspoonful of 
salt and one teaspoonful of sugar, then add a cup of 



tepid water in which a cake of compressed yeast has 
been dissolved, two tablespoonfuls of melted butter; 
when mixed break in one egg and add flour enough 
to make a soft dough. Knead well, beating the 
dough upon the board. Set to rise in a warm place, 
when light knead again, adding only enough flour to 
keep from sticking to the board, roll out about half 
an inch thick, cut with a biscuit-cutter, brush with 
melted butter, fold in half and set to rise again. 
These rolls can be set at noon if for tea, or in the 
inorning if for luncheon, or they can be made up at 
night for breakfast, when use only half a yeast cake. 
This dough can be moulded into small, oblong rolls 
for afternoon teas. 

BOSTON BROWN BREAD. 
One cup of yellow corn meal, one cup and a half 
of Graham flour, an even teaspoonful of salt, an even 
teaspoonful of soda, two cups of sour milk, half a 
cup of Porto Rico molasses, and butter the size of a 
large w^alnut. Sift the corn meal and soda together, 
add the Graham flour and salt, then the milk and 
molasses, melt the butter and stir in at the last. 
Butter a brown bread mould, pour in the mixture,

milk and add the half pint of boiling water, set away 
to cool. Put the flour into the bread pan, add milk 
and water when lukewarm and the dissolved yeast ; 
beat well. In the morning add half a cup of Porto

Dissolve half a yeast cake, two heaping tea- 
spoonfuls of sugar and one of salt in a cup and a 
third of tepid water, then stir into it a pint of white 
flour, and when smooth add enough rye flour to

bread. Knead thoroughly about fifteen minutes and 
set to rise. In the morning make into a loaf and put 
in a crusty bread pan. 

QUICK WHITE BREAD. 

Three pints of flour, an even teaspoonful of salt, 
two cakes of compressed yeast dissolved in tepid

colander, shake them well, set in a warm place to 
dry. Stone and chop enough to make a cupful, and 
knead into a loaf of white bread just before setting

out, arrange daintily on a platter, pour the sauce 
around them, sprinkle the teaspoonful of the yolk 
reserved over them, garnish with parsley and serve. 

FRIED STUFFED EGGS. 
Prepare the eggs as in the recipe for stuffed eggs, 
filling the cavity of the whites evenly, and pressing 
the tw^o halves together so as to make it appear as a 
whole tgg. Take what is left of the mixture, add to 
it one raw^ egg beaten light, roll each egg in this, cov- 
ering thoroughly every part of it, and fry in boiling

moistened with a little hot milk. Have ready a 
white sauce, pour it over them and put on the top of 
each egg a teaspoonful of tomato catsup; garnish 
with parsley and serve. 

EGGS POACHED IN CREAM. 
Half a pint of cream, six eggs, salt and white 
pepper, and a small teaspoonful of finely minced 
parsley. Bring the cream to a boil in a chafing dish, 
break the eggs carefully, to keep the yolks whole, into 
the cream and cook until the whites are set — about 
three minutes. Have a delicate slice of toast for 
each egg on hot plates, lay an egg on each, pour the 
cream over them, sprinkle with pepper and salt and 
the chopped parsley and serve. 

EGGS POACHED IN TOMATOES. 
Put a quart can of tomatoes in a saucepan over 
the fire \vith half an onion, three cloves, a bay leaf, 
a sprig of parsley, a saltspoonful of sugar, and salt

proper consistency, season with salt and pepper and 
strain. Put the egg slices in the sauce, let it come to 
the boiling point and serve on a small platter ; gar- 
nish with parsley. Half a dozen olives boiled in a 
little water and cut from the stones are a nice addi- 
tion to the sauce. 




Soups. 



Bran tea, made in the proportion of a pint of bran to three 
quarts of water, is used by many vegetarians as a foundation for 
soup. Butter should be used generously with it. 

A broth made from white beans is also good where a white 
stock is required. Pick over the beans carefully, soak over night, 
drain and add fresh water in the morning — three pints of water to 
a pint of beans— cook gently until tender. If it is to be used as a 
stock, strain without mashing the beans. If the water they are 
boiled in is hard, a small pinch of soda will soften it. 

CREAM OF JERUSALEM ARTICHOKES. 
Wash and peel enough artichokes to make a 
pint when cut in sHces. Put them in a saucepan 
with a tablespoonful of butter, let them simmer in 
this for a few minutes without taking color, then 
cover with water and boil until tender. Rub through 
a sieve, put back on the stove with a quart of milk, 
and a tablespoonful of butter rubbed into a table- 
spoonful — slightly heaping — of flour, season to taste 
with salt and pepper, let it come to a boil. Remove 
from the fire and add two egg j^olks, beaten with 
half a cup of cream, stir rapidU% and serve at once. 

CREAM OF ASPARAGUS. 
Prepare a bunch of asparagus in the usual way 
for cooking, cut off the points about an inch in 
length and put aside. Cover the stalks and half an 
onion cut in slices, with boiling w^ater, cook until 
tender and press through a puree sieve with the 
water they were boiled in. Melt a good tablespoon- 
ful of butter in a saucepan, and stir into it half a 
tablespoonful of flour, add the puree of asparagus 
and let it come to a boil, season with salt and pepper 



to taste. Have the asparagus points cooked tender 
in a little water. Have ready a pint of boiling milk, 
remove both from the fire and stir the milk into the 
soup, put the asparagus points into the tureen. Beat 
two egg yolks with four tablespoonfuls of cream, 
stir quickly into the soup and pour into the tureen. 

CREAM OF LIMA BEANS. 
Put over the fire a quart of lima beans in boiling 
water to cover them ; w^hen nearly tender add a baj^ 
leaf, half a white onion, and salt and white pepper 
to taste. Let them cook until very tender, remove 
from the fire, and mash through a colander with the 
water in which they were boiled. Put back in the 
saucepan on the range, let it come to a boil, then add 
a heaping tablespoonful of butter and a pint of boil- 
ing milk, stir well, remove and press through a puree 
sieve that it may be smooth. Beat four tablespoon- 
fuls of cream, add when the soup is in the tureen and 
serve immediately. This soup is very nice when made 
from the best canned lima beans, using two cans and 
following the recipe as above. 

CREAM OF CAULIFLOWER. 
Cut one small cauliflower into flowerettes, reserve 
a tablespoonful, put the rest into a saucepan w^ith 
three cups of boiling water, one small white onion, 
half a small celeriac cut in slices, and a ba^- leaf. 
Cook together ten minutes, drain and put the veg- 
etables into a double boiler w4th two heaping table- 
spoonfuls of butter, a heaping tablespoonful of flour, 
salt and pepper to taste ; steam for ten minutes. Put 
the flowerettes into the water the vegetables were 
boiled in and cook until tender, remove and put aside 
to keep warm, measure the water and add sufficient 
from the kettle to make two cupfuls, pour this over 
the vegetables, cook until tender and press through 



a fine sieve. Bring two cups of milk to the boiling 
point, turn the puree into this, let it boil up once, 
remove from the fire. Beat two egg yolks and four 
tablespoonfuls of rich cream together, add some of 
the soup to this, then mix all together, turn into the 
tureen, add the flowerettes and serve at once. 

CREAM OF CELERY. 
Take of the coarser parts of celerj^ as much as 
will make two heads, wash and cut in pieces, put in 
a saucepan with half an onion cut in slices and cover 
with boiling water. Cook until tender and press 
through a sieve with the water in which it was 
boiled. Make a roux of butter and flour as in other 
cream soups, add the puree to it and as much boiling 
milk as will make it the proper consistency. Season 
with salt and pepper, and finish with a beaten egg 
yolk and two tablespoonfuls of cream, adding this 
after the soup has been removed from the fire. 

CREAM OF CHESTNUTS. 

Shell and blanch a pint of large French chestnuts. 
Put them in a saucepan and almost cover them with 
boiling water, cook until tender. Before they are 
quite done add a little salt. When done remove from 
the fire, rub through a puree sieve with the water 
they were boiled in. Melt a generous heaping table- 
spoonful of butter with an even tablespoonful of 
flour and add to it by degrees a pint of boiling milk, 
let it cook until thick, then stir in the chestnut puree 
and salt and pepper to taste. Let it come to a boil 
and serve. 

CREAM OF CUCUMBERS. 

Peel and cut into slices four cucumbers and one 
small white onion, put in a saucepan with enough 
boiling water to cover them, cook until tender, press 
through a fine sieve and pour into a saucepan, stand 

33 



Avhere it will keep hot without cooking. Have a 
cream sauce ready, made by melting two heaping 
tablespoonfuls of butter in a saucepan with two 
tablespoonfuls of flour, let them cook together until 
the mixture no longer adheres to the pan, then add 
gradually a quart of milk, an even teaspoonful of 
white pepper, a heaping teaspoonful of salt, let it boil 
for a few minutes until thick and pour into the 
cucumber puree, add two tablespoonfuls of rich 
cream, let it come to the boiling point, and serve at 
once. This is a verj^ delicate soup, and cooking or 
stcinding on the stove after it is done will spoil it. 
Groult's potato flour is nicer for thickening cream 
soups than the common flour, but, if used, only half 
the quantity' called for in the recipes is needed. 

CREAM OF SUMMER SQUASH.

water and chop verj^ fine— there must be two cupfuls. 
Have a cup of boiling milk in a saucepan and put the 
potatoes into it, cook until tender, but not soft, and 
be careful not to let them burn ; when done add two 
generous heaping tablespoonfuls of butter, two heap- 
ing tablespoonfuls of French carrots, previously 
cooked in as little water as possible, and chopped 
very fine, one heaping teaspoonful of green pepper, 
one of parsley, one heaping teaspoonful of grated 
onion, a heaping saltspoonful of powdered mace, a 
dash of cayenne pepper and salt to taste. Measure 
two tablespoonfuls of tomatoes— after all the water 
has been pressed from them — chop fine and add to it 
one whole egg and one egg yolk beaten light, stir 



this into the potato mixture while on the stove, 
remove at once from the fire, add two heaping table- 
spoonfuls of cracker crumbs rolled fine, and two 
tablespoonfuls of fine Madeira or sherr^^ Turnout to 
cool and then form into chops, roll in egg and cracker 
crumbs and fr^'- in boiling fat. Serve with cucumber 

salad.

shells, sprinkle bread crumbs over the tops and a 
little melted butter, put in the oven for an instant to 
brown. 

RAGOUT OF EGG PLANT. 

Boil a small egg plant until tender. Peel it thinly 
and set aside to get cold. Cut in slices an inch thick 



and cover the bottom of a baking dish with them. 
Melt a generous tablespoonful of butter in a sauce- 
pan and stir into it two heaping tablespoonfuls of 
fresh mushrooms, a heaping teaspoonful of parsley, 
a heaping teaspoonful of onion, all chopped very fine, 
season with salt and pepper and pour over the egg 
plant. When it is time to put it in the oven sprinkle 
with Parmesan cheese and fine breadcrumbs and dot 
with small lumps of butter, and bake until brown in 
a quick oven. Serve in the dish in which it is baked 
wath the following sauce in a sauce boat. 

Sauce. — Boil the skins and stems of the mush- 
rooms in a cup of water; while they are cooking, 
broAvn together in a spider a slightly heaping table- 
spoonful of butter, a slightly heaping tablespoonful

PATTIES OF PUFF PASTE. 

Roll out some puff paste an inch thick, cut w^ith 
a patty-cutter as many rounds as are needed, then 
with a smaller cutter stamp each round about half 
an inch deep. Bake in a quick oven; when done lift 
the centers out carefully w^ith a knife, remove a little 
oi the inside. When wanted heat the patty shells and 
fill with spaghettina in tomato sauce, mushrooms or 
A'cgetables in a cream or savor^^ sauce, or the filling 
as given for spinach border mould. A few trufl[ies 



cut fine are a nice addition to tomato sauce. Lay 
the little tops on and serve. 

SAVORY RICE (a Mexican Dish). 
Wash half a cup of rice, drain from the water. 
Put a heaping tablespoonful of butter in a spider, 
Tvhen hot add a small leek or white onion and the 
rice, fry until the rice is a golden brown — do not let it 
get too dark. Have ready a vegetable stock, nearly 
fill the spider and cook twenty minutes until the rice 
is perfectly dry. Every grain should stand alone. 
Turn out on a platter and serve with tomato sauce. 

RAGOUT OF ASPARAGUS WITH MOCK MEAT BALLS. 
Scrape and wash a bunch of asparagus, cut in 
pieces about an inch long as far as the stalks are 
very tender, put the remainder of the stalks with an 
onion into a saucepan, cover w^ith boiling v^ater and 
let it cook until tender — about half an hour. Then 
mash them in the water in which they w^ere boiled 
through a colander. Put over the fire again, and 
when it comes to a boil throw in the points and cook 
until tender. While that is cooking make some mock 
meat, as given in a previous recipe, form into balls 
as large as a walnut. Cook them in salted boiling 
"water for five minutes, drain them from the w^ater, 
also the asparagus points from the stock, put them 
together in a saucepan to keep hot while making a 
gravy. Melt a generous heaping tablespoonful of 
butter in a spider, add to it w^hen it bubbles a large 
heaping tablespoonful of flour, stir well until it be- 
comes a dark, rich brown, taking care that it does 
not burn, add the asparagus stock, season wnth salt 
and pepper — this gravy should be like thick cream-

and stir into it one large cup and a half of rice that 
has been boiled in salted water twenty minutes. Add 
a slightly heaping teaspoonful of curry powder, a few 
drops of onion juice and salt to taste. When it comes 
to a boil add a beaten egg to it, stir a minute and 
remove from the fire. Turn it out, let it cool, and 
then form into cylinders and fry as usual. 

MOCK FISH CROQUETTES. 
Slice three medium sized potatoes, boil until ten- 
der, but not soft, chop very fine an even teaspoonful 
of onion with three zepherettes or small square 
crackers, then add the hot potatoes and chop all 
together, season with a dash of cayenne pepper, a

of butter, an even tablespoonful of grated onion, a 
scant teaspoonful of ground mace. Melt a heaping 
tablespoonful of butter in a saucepan with half a 
tablespoonful of flour and add gradually to it a cup-

add a tablespoonful of lemon juice; turn out on a 
platter to cool, form into cylinders, dip in egg and 
bread crumbs, as usual, and fry in boiling fat. 




Vegetables. 



Vegetables should be cooked in as little water as possible ; the 
better way is to steam them. So much of the valuable salts are 
washed out by boiling in too much water. 

All vegetables left over can be warmed again, either in a cream 
sauce, or put in a double boiler and steamed, adding a little more 
butter. 

When pepper is used, it should alwa\-s be white pepper, espe- 
cially in white sauces and soups. 

Never salt vegetables until they are nearly cooked ; it hardens 
them. 

The water vegetables are boiled in may be utilized in making 
sauces and soups ; the best of the vegetables goes into it. 

The water Jerusalem artichokes are boiled in becomes quite 
a thick jelly when cold, and makes an excellent foundation for 
sauces. 

TO BOIL POTATOES. 

Select potatoes of uniform size, wash and pare 
thinly, cover with boiling water and cook half an 
hour ; when nearly done add salt. As soon as done 
drain from the water and set the saucepan -where the 
potatoes can steam for a few minutes. They should 
be served immediately, and never allowed to remain 
in the water a moment after they are cooked. Pota- 
toes are much better steamed with their skins on 
than boiled, as they then retain all the potashes. 
When they are old they should be washed, pared and 
covered with cold water, and allowed to stand for 
several hours before either boiling or frying. 

POTATOES BAKED. 
Select them of uniform size, wash and scrub well, 
cut a thin slice from each end to prevent their being 
soggy- They require nearly an hour to bake in a 
moderate oven. 



TO MASH POTATOES. 
Boil the potatoes carefully, drain from the water, 
mash fine, and to four good-sized potatoes add a 
heaping tablespoonful of butter, a tablespoonful or 
two of cream or rich milk and salt and pepper to 
taste. Serve at once. They must be freshly mashed 
and A^ery hot to be eatable. The mashed potatoes 
ma^'be squeezed through a vegetable rifcr, when they 
are called Potatoes a la Neige. 

NEW POTATOES WITH CREAM SAUCE. 

Select rather small potatoes of uniform size and 
boil. When done drain off the water, set them back 
on the stove to keep hot while making a cream sauce, 
then put them carefully in a vegetable dish, pour the 
sauce over them and sprinkle with a little finely 
minced parsley. 

BROILED POTATOES. 

Take some cold boiled potatoes and cut them in 
rather thick slices lengthwise, dust with white pepper 
and salt, dip each slice in melted butter, broil over a 
clear fire until a nice bro\vn. Serve with melted but- 
ter and finely minced parsley poured over them. 

POTATOES A LA CREME AU GRATIN.

Parmesan cheese or Edam cheese grated, one table- 
spoonful of bread crumbs, and dot all over with tiny 
bits of butter. Put in a quick oven for a few minutes 
to brown. Do not leave it in too long, or it will be- 
come dry. 

STUFFED POTATOES. 

Bake some medium-sized potatoes ; when done 
cut in half lengthwise, scoop out the inside, taking 

5S 



care not to break the skin. Mash the potato smooth 
and fine with butter and a httle milk, season with 
salt and pepper to taste, heat thoroughly, fill the 
skins, brush the tops over with melted butter, brown 
in the oven and serve. 

POTATO FRICASSEE. 
Put in a spider a generous tablespoonfiil of butter 
and a cup of milk, when hot add some cold potatoes 
cut in dice, season with pepper, salt, a fe-w drops of 
onion juice. Let them get thoroughly hot, then add 
the beaten yolks of two eggs, stir constantly until 
thick. Great care must be taken not to let it cook 
too long, or the sauce will curdle. Pour into a vege- 
table dish, sprinkle a little fineh' minced parsley over 
the top and serve. 

POTATOES A LA DUCHESSE. 
Take cold mashed potatoes that are nicely sea- 
soned with salt and pepper, form into little round 
cakes, put them on a tin, glaze over with beaten egg 
and brown in the oven. Arrange on a platter, gar- 
nish with parsley and serve. 

SARATOGA CHIPS. 
Peel some medium-sized white potatoes, and slice 
them very thin. It is better to have a potato sheer 
for these, if possible, as it cuts them so quickly and 
perfectl3\ Wash the potatoes in one or two waters, 
then cover with fresh water and lay a lump of ice on 
the top of them. Let them stand an hour, if con- 
venient, drain in a colander, wipe dry with a towel, 
and fry in boiling fat — not too many at a time in the 
basket or they will stick together, and will not 
brown. Have a quick fire, and fry until brown and 
crisp, drain on paper, sprinkle with salt and serve. 



FRENCH FRIED POTATOES. 
Peel some potatoes and cut in finger lengths, not 
too thick, cover with ice water, and if thej are old 
it is better to let them stand two hours. Drain, wipe 
dry, and fry in boiling fat as Saratoga chips — not too 
many at a time. When they are a nice brown lift 
the basket from the fat, sprinkle with salt, shake the 
grease from them and remove with a skimming 
spoon, drain on paper and serve at once. 

POTATOES A LA MAITRE D^HOTEL. 
Cut cold boiled potatoes in round slices, not too 
thick, put in a saucepan with some melted butter, 
pepper and salt. When they are hot add some lemon 
juice and a little minced parsley and serve. 

POTATOES LYONNAISE. 
Fry a little onion cut in thin slices in plenty of 
butter ; when a delicate brown add some cold boiled 
potatoes cut in slices of medium thickness, mixing 
them with the onion by tossing them together rather 
than stirring, as this breaks them. Cook until a nice 
color, drain them, put in a dish and sprinkle a little 
minced parsley over them. 

POTATOES A LA PARISIENNE. 
Peel and wash some potatoes, scoop out into 
little balls with a potato scoop, v^hich is made for 
the purpose. Boil for five minutes, put in melted

ered with the butter, turn them into a pan, and 
brown in the oven. Turn out on a dish and sprinkle 
with minced parsley and a little salt. 

POTATOES CREAMED AND BROWNED. 
Take a pint of cold boiled potatoes, cut into dice 
of uniform size. Have ready a pint of cream sauce, 

60 



toss the potatoes in this, season with salt and white

dried bread crumbs and a tablespoonful of American 
Edam cheese. A few drops of onion juice, if liked, 
may be added before putting the potatoes into the 
dish. Set it in the oven a few minutes, until it be- 
comes a golden brown and serve. Do not let it stand 
in the oven long or it will dry. 

POTATO PUFF. 
Two cupfuls of smoothly mashed boiled or baked 
potatoes, two tablespoonfuls of melted butter, two 
well-beaten whites of eggs, a cupful of sweet cream 
or rich milk. Stir the melted butter into the potato, 
then add the eggs and cream, season with salt and 
pepper, turn into a buttered baking dish, bake in a 
quick oven and serve in the dish in which it is baked. 

WHITE POTATO CROQUETTES. 
Boil and mash very fine four medium sized pota- 
toes. Put half a cup of rich milk and a generous 
heaping tablespoonful of butter in a saucepan over 
the fire. When the milk comes to a boil, stir in the 
mashed potatoes, season \vith pepper and salt to 
taste, mix thoroughly and add the white of an egg 
beaten to a stiff froth, remove from the fire, turn out 
on a plate to cool, then make up in small cylinders, 
dip in beaten egg, roll in cracker crumbs and fry a 
delicate brown in boiling fat. 

POTATO PAPA (a Mexican Dish). 
Wash, pare and boil one dozen small white pota- 
toes, mash while hot and add to them half a cup of 
raisins stoned and chopped very fine, twenty large 
Queen olives stoned and chopped fine, one table- 
spoonful of parsley finely minced, an even teaspoonfiil 
of sugar, and salt and pepper to taste. Mix all well 



together, form into an oblong shape, leaving the top 
rough. Brown a little butter in a spider, put the 
papa into it, and after a few moments' frying scatter 
little lumps of butter over the top and set in the 
oven to brown. Garnish with parsley and hard- 
boiled eggs cut in quarters lengthwise. 

SWEET POTATOES FRIED RAW. 
Peel two or three medium-sized potatoes and cut

wise, not too thin. Dip each slice in melted butter 
and then in brown sugar, and fry in a little butter. 

SWEET POTATOES MASHED AND BROWNED. 

Boil three sweet potatoes of medium size until 
done. Peel and squeeze through the patent vegeta- 
ble strainer, add a heaping tablespoonful of butter, 
salt and pepper to taste, and enough milk to make 
very soft. Put in a baking dish, dot it over with 
tinj' bits of butter and bake until brown. Serve in 
the dish in which it is baked. If any is left over re- 
move the thin brown skin, make the potato into 
small, flat cakes and brown on both sides in a little 
butter in a spider. 

SWEET POTATO CROQUETTES. 

Three medium-sized potatoes baked and mashed 
very fine and beaten to a cream with one generous 
tablespoonful of butter, three tablespoonfuls of cream,

wash well a quart of Brussels sprouts, put into a 
saucepan with two quarts of boiling water and a 
saltspoonful of soda. Boil rapidly until tender- 
about half an hour— just before they are done add a 
tablespoonful of salt. Drain them in a colander, and 
if it is not time to serve them stand the colander over 
steam to keep them hot. Do not let them remain in 
the water. When ready to serve put the sprouts in 
a vegetable dish and pour over them a pint of rich 
cream sauce. 

OKRA AND TOMATOES.

cut in slices, cook until tender, season with a gener- 
ous heaping tablespoonful of butter, and pepper and 
salt to taste. 

BEETS. 

Wash the beets carefully to avoid breaking the 
skin, and do not cut off the fine roots, as this will 
bleed and spoil them. Put on in boiling water and 
cook from an hour and a half to three hours. Test 
with a wooden skewer. Cut in slices or dice and 
serve with melted butter, pepper and salt. Winter 
beets should be soaked over night. 

PUREE OF PEAS. 
When peas are old this is a very nice way to use 
them. Put a quart of shelled peas over the fire in 
sufficient boiling water to cook them. Boil until 

63 



tender, drain from the water, press through a puree 
sieve, season with salt and pepper to taste, and a 
good heaping tablespoonful of butter, and if too dry 
a little milk or cream may be used. 

PUREE OF LIMA BEANS 
may be prepared in the same way. 

PUREE OF CUCUMBERS.

egg, pepper and salt to taste, a few drops of onion 
juice, or the spoon used for stirring the mixture may 
be rubbed with garlic, three tablespoonfuls of grated 
bread crumbs, one egg beaten, stir all together, and 
remove at once from the fire. Put the cucumbers in 
a saucepan, cover with boiling water and cook 
gently until tender — about ten or fifteen minutes; 
when nearly done add a tablespoonful of salt, drain 
from the water, when cool enough stuff them with 
the dressing already prepared and press into shape, 
brush with egg, sprinkle bread crumbs over the top 
and a few tinA'^ lumps of butter, place carefully in a 
pan and bake a delicate brown. 



For the Sauce, take the tablespoonful of apple 
and pickle reserved from the stuffing, and add a tea- 
spoonful of capers, chop all together as fine as possi- 
ble, make a cream sauce and add this mixture to it 
on the fire and heat thoroughly. Place the cucum- 
bers carefully on a platter and pour the sauce around 
them. 

CUCUMBERS STUFFED WITH MUSHROOMS. 
Peel two large, firm cucumbers, and cut in half 
lengthwise ; take out the seeds. Take a quarter of a

Stuif the cucumbers with this dressing, put the halves 
together, fasten with wooden toothpicks or tie with 
string. Place in a small dish that will fit in the 
steamer, cover closely, and steam until tender— about 
three-quarters of an hour— and serve with a brown 
sauce made as follows : 

The Sauce.— Put on the skins and stems of the 
mushrooms in boiling water. Fry a few slices each 
of carrot, celery top, green pepper, onion and tur- 
nip in butter, strain the water from the mush- 
room stems into this and stew until all are tender, 
strain, add a generous tablespoonful of butter and 
enough flour to thicken the sauce, and salt and pep- 
per to taste. Place the cucumbers in a shallow veg- 
etable dish, remove the strings and pour the sauce 
around them. 

ESCALLOPED EGG PLANT. 

Boil a small egg plant, cut it in half, take out the 
pulp, throwing away the seeds and skin, chop the 



pulp fine and mix with it half a teaspoonful of bread 
crumbs, one cup of cream or rich milk, butter the 
size of an egg, an even teaspoonful of finely minced 
parsley, pepper and salt to taste, and a few drops of 
onion juice. Beat all together, turn into a baking

dish in which it is baked. If any is left over, cut in 
slices half an inch thick and fry in butter for luncheon. 

STUFFED EGG PLANT. 

Take half a large egg plant, boil gently until 
tender, remove from the fire, take out the pulp care- 
fully so as not to break the shell, leaving it about a 
quarter of an inch thick. Peel and stem a quarter of 
a pound of fresh mushrooms, chop very fine, reserve 
a heaping tablespoonful of this for the sauce, then 
add the pulp of the egg plant to the mushrooms in 
the chopping bowl, and one heaping tablespoonful of 
currants, v^ashed and picked over, one even tea- 
spoonful of grated onion, one even teaspoonful of 
chopped green pepper, five heaping tablespoonfuls of 
grated bread crumbs, four tablespoonfuls of melted 
butter, two tablespoonfuls of rich cream. Mix all 
well together, fill the shell with this mixture, press 
it into shape and bind carefully with string. Bake 
twenty minutes, remove the string and serve on a 
platter w^ith the sauce poured around it. 

The Sauce.— Put on the skins and stems of the 
mushrooms in a saucepan, cover with boiling water, 
cook until tender, drain, and into this water put the 
tablespoonful of reserved mushrooms, add salt and

GREEN CORN CAKES. 
One quart of grated corn, one teacup of butter 
melted, four tablespoonfuls of flour, two eggs, and 
salt and pepper to taste. Bake as griddle cakes and 
serve at once. These cakes are very good made of 
canned corn. Pound the corn in a mortar and press 
through a sieve. 

CORN PUDDING. 
Four large ears of corn grated, or a can of com 
prepared as for corn cakes, one heaping tablespoon- 
ful of butter, one teaspoonful of flour, one teaspoon- 
ful of sugar, one whole egg and one yolk. Melt the 
butter and stir into the corn, beat the eggs and add 
with one pint of milk, the sugar and flour, and salt 
and pepper to taste. Bake in a shallow dish in a 
moderate oven from twenty minutes to half an hour. 
If it bakes too long, it becomes watery. 

MOCK OYSTERS OF GREEN CORN. 
A pint of grated corn, a cup of flour, one egg, two 
ounces of butter, three tablespoonfuls of milk, and 
salt and pepper to taste. Mix well and drop from a 
spoon in oblong cakes— to look as much like oysters 
as possible— into hot butter, fry brown on both sides. 
Serve on a platter and garnish with parsley. These 
may also be made of canned corn by pressing it 
through a colander with a potato masher to sepa- 
rate the hulls from it. 

CORN BOILED ON THE COB. 
Husk the corn and remove the silk, put in a 
kettle, and cover with boiling water. If the corn is 
young, it will cook in from five to ten minutes, as it 
is only necessary to set the milk. It should be served 
at once in a folded napkin. 



CURRY OF CORN. 
A can of corn, one good tart cooking apple, one 
tomato, a teaspoonful of finely chopped green pepper, 
a teaspoonful of grated onion, a teaspoonful of curry

walnuts, two tablespoonfuls of butter, and salt and 
pepper to taste. Put the butter in a spider, when it 
bubbles add the apple cut in dice and onion, fry 
brown, then stir in the curry powder, the chopped 
pepper and tomato and nuts, let all simmer together 
for a few minutes, then add the com, and cook gently 
for tw^enty minutes. If it is too thick a little water 
must be added. Serve in a shallow vegetable dish or 
on a platter. Fresh corn may be used. Boil and 
then cut from the cob, cook the cobs in the water the 
corn was boiled in long enough to extract all the 
good from them, and use this broth for the curry. 

CROQUETTES OF SAI^IFY AND CELERIAC. 
Two roots of salsify and one large celeriac. 
Wash and scrape them w^ell. Cut in pieces and cover 
with vinegar and water and let them stand one

them with boiling water, cook until very tender, 
mash fine and smooth, season with pepper and salt, 
and a few drops of onion juice, put in a saucepan 
over the fire, and add a tablespoonful of butter, two 
tablespoonfuls of milk, and just before removing 
from the fire add a tablespoonful of cream and one 
egg, stir well, turn out into a bowl and set aside to

Equal quantities of cauliflower and potatoes, raw. 
The cauliflower cut into flowerettes and the potatoes 



into dice. Put them into a spider with a heaping table- 
spoonful of butter, a rounded teaspoonful of curry 
powder, and let them simmer for a few minutes ^th- 
out taking color. Then add two tablespoonfuls of 
tomatoes, an even teaspoonful of grated onion and 
one of chopped green pepper, fill up the spider with 
boiling \v^ater, and set it back on the stove v^^here it 
will stew gently until the vegetables are tender and 
the water has been reduced to one- third the quantity. 
It should be as thick as ordinary gravy ; if not, add 
a scant teaspoonful of flour. Just before it is done 
stir in a heaping tablespoonful of butter. Turn it 
into a shallow vegetable dish and serve very hot. 
The spider should be kept covered while the curry is 
cooking. It is very good v^ithout the green pepper. 
This may be warmed over, and is better the second 
day than the first. 

KOHLRABI. 
Peel them, cut in slices and pour on just enough 
boiling water to cook them. Cook until tender.

up once and serve very hot.

generous cup of butter, two large tablespoonfuls of 
Porto Rico molasses, two tablespoonfuls of salt, less 
than a teaspoonful of pepper, and fill the jar with 
boiling water. Put in the oven, covering the jar 
with a tin cover. It must be cooked in a slow oven 
eight or nine hours — the water ought to last until 



the beans are perfectly cooked, and when done a 
good gravy left, about a third of the depth of the 
beans in the jar. Beans cooked in this -way are very 
nutritious and easily digested. Keep them covered 
for two or three hours while cooking. Serve vv^ith 
Chili sauce.

Lemon juice ma3^ be used, instead of vinegar, if pre- 
ferred. 

CREAM SALAD DRESSING. 

One-quarter of a cup of strong cider vinegar, one 
cup and a quarter of w^ater, one-half cup of butter, 
one teaspoonful of mustard, one teaspoonful of salt, 
onetablespoonful, slightly heaping, of cornstarch, one 
teaspoonful of sugar, a dash of cayenne pepper and 
the yolks of four eggs. Put the vinegar and water 
in a saucepan and v^hen it boils add the butter. Beat 
the 3^olks of eggs and the other ingredients together 
with an egg-beater, making it quite foamy and light; 
pour the boiling vinegar and water upon this mix- 
ture, which -will partially thicken. The bowl in which 
it is mixed should be placed in a pan of hot water on 
the stove, beating it all the time with the egg-beater. 
Just before it reaches the boiling point remove and 
turn it out into a cold bowl, beating hard for a few 
minutes. When perfectly cold pour it into a glass 
jar, fasten down the top and keep in refrigerator.

FRENCH DRESSING. 

One tablespoonful of vinegar, three tablespoon- 
fuls of olive oil, a saltspoonful of salt and one of 
white pepper, and a few drops of any good sauce. 
Lettuce should be well washed in very cold water, 
leaf bj^ leaf, and drained in a basket, which comes for 
the purpose, then placed on the ice, and at serving 
time put into the salad bowl. Lettuce should never 
be cut with a knife, but torn with a fork and spoon, 
and it should not be allowed to stand after the dress- 
ing is poured over it. 

TOMATO ICE SALAD. 

Put a quart can of tomatoes in a saucepan over 
the fire with half an onion, a slice of green pepper, it 
convenient, three cloves, two bay leaves, a sprig of 
parsley, a teaspoonful of sugar, and pepper and salt 
to taste. Cook until the onion is tender — about ten 
minutes — remove from the fire, press through a sieve 
fine enough to retain the seeds. When cold freeze as 
water-ice and mould — a melon mould is very pretty 
for it — pack in salt and ice in the usual way ; turn it 
out in a nest of crisp young lettuce and serve with a 
mayonnaise dressing in a sauceboat. 

* TOMATO JELLY. 
One can of tomatoes put on to heat in a granite 
or porcelain-lined saucepan with a large slice of onion, 
one clove, tw^o ba}^ leaves, a teaspoonful of chopped 
green pepper, salt to taste and a little sugar. Soak 
half a box of gelatine in a little w^ater for half an 

*\Ve have as yet in this country' no substitute for animal gelatine. I 
have experimented with carrageen or Irish moss and tlie Sea-moss 
Farine preparation, and find them unsatisfactory. It is inipossitile 
to make a clear jelly with them, and by soaking in water to destroy the 
sea flavor, the solidifying property is lost. In England they have a vege- 
table gelatine (Agar Agar) which makes, I am told, a clear, sparkling 
jelly, and is said not to be expensive. I trust that before many months 
it may be obtainable here. I have ventured, therefnre, to give a few 
recipes where gelatine is used, knowing that there will be something to 
replace it. Groult's tapioca and potato flour are said to be unadulter- 
ated, and with fresh fruit juices make nice and wholesome desserts, espe- 
ciallv for children. These preparations are made in France, and put up 
in half-pound packages, and sold by all of our leading grocers.

hour, and after the tomatoes have simmered fifteen 
minutes let them come to a boil and pour over the 
gelatine to dissolve it ; strain through a very fine 
sieve into a bow^l, let it get perfectly cold, and v^hen 
it begins to thicken stir well and turn into an earth- 
enware mould. It looks prettier in a round one. Set 
on ice. Serve the jelly on a round dish in a bed of 
fresh, crisp young lettuce leaves, and place a spoonful 
offender, finely-cut celery in each leaf, and pour may- 
onnaise around it. The jelly is better made the day 
before it is needed. 

SPAGHETTINA AND CELERY SALAD. 
Take some cold boiled spaghettina, chop — not 
too fine— and cover with a French dressing, and let 
it stand on the ice until serving time. Have an equal 
quantity of fresh, crisp celery cut fine, mix with the 
spaghettina, cover with a mayonnaise dressing and 
garnish with tender lettuce leaves. 

SALAD OF FAIRY RINGS AND PUFF BALL MUSHROOMS. 
Have both very fresh ; cook the fairy rings until 
tender, set aside to get cold, then put on the ice. 
Take an equal quantit3^ of puff ball raw, chop fine, 
mix with the rings, turn into a nest of tender young 
lettuce, cover with a mayonnaise dressing and serve. 

SALAD OF FRESH FRUIT. 
Peel and cut into dice enough fruit, peaches, tart 
plums, orange and banana to fill a cup and a cupful 
of crisp celery cut fine ; have both ice cold ; at serving 
time mix and cover with a cream dressing and gar- 
nish with celery tops. 

* CUCUMBER JELLY. 
Half a box of gelatine soaked for an hour in half 
a cup of cold water. Remove the seeds from a small 

*This jelly may be colored a delicate green by using extract of 
spinach (see recipe, page 164). Its appearance is much improved 
thereby. 



green pepper, peel and cut into slices two large, fine, 
fresh cucumbers, or three small ones and a small 
white onion. Put in a saucepan, add a bay leaf and 
a bouquet of parsley, cover with boiling water and 
cook until tender ; remove the parsley and bay leaf, 
add a saltspoonful of sugar, salt to taste — more than 
a teaspoonful will be required — and press through a 
fine sieve. There should be, when strained, two cups 
and a half. Pour it over the soaked gelatine — if it is 
not hot enough to dissolve the gelatine place the 
saucepan over the fire for a moment — then run it 
through the same sieve again ; set aside in a bowl to 
cool. When perfectly cold and beginning to congeal, 
stir it well and pour into a pretty, round mould ; set 
it on ice until ready to serve. Turn it out on a plate 
and arrange fresh, crisp, young lettuce leaves around 
it, into each of \vhich put a spoonful of mayonnaise 
or cream dressing. 

WALNUT AND CELERY SALAD. y. 

,|, Three cupfuls of fresh, crisp celery cut fine and 
two cupfuls of walnuts, carefully shelled that they 
maybe as little broken as possible. Put the walnuts 
in a saucepan with a small onion sliced, a bay leaf, a 
clove and twelve pepper corns, cover with boiling 
v^^ater, let them cook for ten or fifteen minutes, re- 
move from the fire, drain and throw the nuts into 
cold w^ater, remove the skins and let them get cold ; 
then set on the ice until it is time to serve. Mix them 
with the celery, add mayonnaise or cream dressing, 
put on a dish or in a salad bowl, garnish with the 
tender green celery leaves and serve. 

PINEAPPLE AND CELERY SALAD. 
Equal parts of celery and shredded pineapple. 
Have the celery of the very tenderest, using onlj- the 
best of the heads. Select a perfectly ripe, fresh pine- 
apple, pare it, removing the eyes carefully, and shred 



the fruit with a silver fork and cut into small pieces 
with a silver fruit knife ; put the celery, cut fine, and 
the shredded pineapple, each by itself on the ice, that 
they may be very cold. When it is time to serve the 
salad, mix them together, put on the salad dish, 
cover with mayonnaise dressing, garnish w^ith the 
green celer3^ leaves and serve at once. 

FRUIT SALAD. 
Equal quantities of grape fruit or oranges, bana- 
nas, apples and celery. Peel the grape fruit or 
oranges, carefully removing all the bitter white skin, 
cut the pulp, the bananas and apples into small dice 
and the celery fine as for other salads ; put the 
orange and apple together; the latter will absorb 
the juice of the orange. Set all on ice; — these 
fruit salads must be ice cold. When it is time to 
serve, mix the fruit and celery together, put into a 
salad bowd, cover with the cream dressing into 
which has been stirred a third as much whipped 
cream as there is dressing, and add a little more salt 
to it in mixing. Serve in a bed of tender lettuce 
leaves. 

POTATO SALAD. 

Prepare equal parts of cold boiled potatoes and 
fresh, crisp celery, cut in small pieces which will look 
attractive when mixed with the dressing ; cut in dice 
four cold, hard boiled eggs, and mix them in lightly 
with the potato and celery when adding the dress- 
ing. Use mayonnaise or cream dressing v^ith this 
salad, garnish with dainty celery tops and serve. 

SALAD OF TOMATOES STUFFED WITH CELERY. 

Select nice, smooth, firm tomatoes, one for each 
person ; blanch them in the usual way, cut a slice from 
the stem end and remove the core and some of the 
seeds ; set on the ice to get cold. Prepare some celery, 
shredding it fine and using only the very tender part ; 



mix it with mayonnaise dressing, stuff the tomatoes, 
allowing the celery to come above the top, serve 
each in a leaf or two of crisp lettuce and pour some 
mayonnaise around them. Salads should be ice cold. 

CELERIAC AND LETTUCE SALAD. 
Boil two or three celery roots in water with a 
little salt until tender; drain and let them get cold. 
Cut them in thin slices, make a nest of crisp lettuce 
and put the celery slices in the center. Serve with a 
French dressing. 

RAW JERUSALEM ARTICHOKES AND LETTUCE SALAD. 
Wash and peel the artichokes, cut in very thin 
slices and put into an earthen bowl with vinegar and 
water with a lump of ice in it. The vinegar will pre- 
vent them from turning dark. When ready to serve, 
place in the center of nice, fresh lettuce and serve 
with a French dressing. 

SALAD A LA MACEDOINE. 
Take several kinds of cold boiled vegetables in 
equal quantities, such as green peas, string beans, 
flowerettes of cauliflower, asparagus points, a small 
potato and a French carrot cut in small dice, and a 
little green pepper if liked ; mix together and serve in 
a nest of fresh, crisp lettuce with a French dressing, 
or mayonnaise, if preferred. 

ASPARAGUS SALAD. 

Select very tender asparagus, cut off all the 
woody part and boil until tender, set aside to get 
cold, and then put on ice until serving time ; arrange 
nicely on a platter or individual plates and serve 
with either mayonnaise or French dressing. 
CUCUMBER SALAD. 

Peel and cut in ver^^ thin slices, lay in a bowl, 
cover -with water, sprinkle a little salt over them 
and put a lump of ice on top, let them remain until 



serving time, drain off the water and serve in a glass 

dish with a French dressing. They should be very 

cold and crisp. A little green pepper, chopped very 

fine, is an addition ; also to rub the spoon used in 

mixing with a clove of garlic gives a piquancy to the 

salad. 

COLD SLAW. 

Select a firm cabbage and shave very fine on a 
cutter that comes for this purpose. Use the cream 
dressing or French dressing with a little dry mustard 
added. 

TOMATO SALAD. 

The tomatoes should be blanched in the usual 
way, and either sliced or cut in dice or served whole ; 
or they inay be cut in quarters, not quite separating 
them, and arranged in a bed of lettuce ^th a spoon- 
ful of mayonnaise on top of each tomato and the let- 
tuce garnished with the same. 
ENDIVE 
is excellent with French dressing. 
EGG SALAD. 

Boil three eggs hard, cut in half lengthwise, re- 
move the 3^olks and mash fine. Mix together in a 
saucepan the third of a teaspoonful each of dry mus- 
tard, salt and ^'hite pepper, a saltspoonful of curr^^ 
powder, a few drops of onion juice, a teaspoonful of 
vinegar, two tablespoonfuls of egg well beaten, two 
teaspoonfuls of olive oil and a tablespoonful of rich 
cream. Put the ingredients together in the order in 
which they are named, beat well, set the bowl over 
the steam of the kettle and stir constantly until 
thick and creamy ; remove and stir in the mashed 
egg yolks, a little at a time, and set on the ice to get 
very cold. To serve, fill the whites of egg, dividing 
the mixture among them, put each half egg on two 
or three leaves of tender lettuce, with mayonnaise 
dressing around them. 



Desserts. 

APPLE BETTY, 
Two cups of tart cooking apples, chopped, a cup 
and a half of stale bread cnimbs — bakers 'bread is the 
best ; four heaping tablespoonfuls of sugar, one gen- 
erous tablespoonful of butter, and the grated rind of 
one lemon. Butter a pudding dish, divide the ingre- 
dients into four layers, beginning with apples and 
finishing with bread crumbs. Sprinkle the sugar and 
lemon over the apples and cut the butter into tiny 
lumps and scatter over the crumbs. Bake three- 
quarters of an hour in a moderate oven. Serve with 
cream or hard sauce. 

APPLE CHARLOTTE. 

Pare, core and quarter eight or nine good cook- 
ing apples, put them into a double boiler with two 
tablespoonfuls of butter, half a cup of sugar, the 
juice and grated rind of a lemon ; cook until tender. 
Take a plain mould that holds three pints, butter it 
well, line the bottom and sides with very thin slices 
of home-made bread. Remove the crust, dip each 
slice in melted butter, fit them evenly together in the 
mould, fill with the apples, cover with the bread, 
dredge it with sugar and bake three-quarters of an 
hour in a quick oven. Have a hot platter, lay it 
over the top of the charlotte, turn it over, and lift off 
the mould. Serve hot with or without sauce or 
cream. 

APPLE CROQUETTES. 

Peel, core and quarter four good-sized cooking 
apples, cut in thin slices and put them in a granite 
ware saucepan over the fire with a small tablespoon- 



ful of butter, a heaping tablespoonful of sugar, the 
grated rind of half a lemon and a saltspoonful of cin- 
namon ; cover tightly and cook until tender, taking 
care that it does not burn. When done add an even 
tablespoonful of Groult's potato flour, mixed with a 
very little water, then stir in one beaten egg, and 
remove from the fire. Turn into a deep plate to get 
cold, form in c^dinders, dip in egg and dried bread 
cruinbs and fr3^ in boiling fat. Sift powdered sugar 
over them and serve hot, with or w^ithout cream. 

APPLES STEWED WHOLE. 

Take some nice, tart cooking apples, pare and 
put them into a saucepan w^ith the juice of tw^o 
lemons and the rind of one ; cover with water, cook 
slowly until they can be pierced with a straw, take 
them from the water with a draining spoon. Make 
a syrup, allowing half a pound of sugar to a pound 
of fruit, use as much of the water the apples were 
cooked in as will dissolve the sugar ; when it comes 
to a boil add the apples and cook until clear. Take 
the apples out, core them and fill with a fruit jelly, if 
liked, boil down the S3^rup and pour over the fruit. 
Serve very cold with whipped or plain cream. Bart- 
lett pears maybe cooked in the same manner, serving 
them whole. 

APPLE SOUFFLE. 

Seven tart, juicy apples, pared and cored, and cut 
fine. Put them over the fire in a double boiler ^vith- 
out any water, steam until tender, then stir into 
them two tablespoonfuls of butter and one cup of 
sugar, remove from the fire, and turn it into a bowl 
to cool. When it is cold beat in the yolks of four 
eggs, whipped very light, a little grated lemon peel, 
and then add alternately the whites of the eggs, 
beaten to a stiff froth, and a cup of stale bread 
crumbs. Beat hard for a fev^ moments and turn into 



a buttered pudding dish and bake in a moderate 
oven about one hour. Cover it while baking until 
ten or fifteen minutes before it is done, so that it will 
not form a hard crust and become dry. Serve warm 
in the dish in which it is baked. 

APPLE CUSTARD.-No. U 
Grate some good, tart cooking apples — enough 
to measure one quart. Beat a generous tablespoon- 
ful of butter and seven tablespoonfuls of sugar to a 
cream, add to this four egg yolks beaten light, then 
the apples and the grated rind of a lemon, and lastly 
the whites of four eggs beaten to a stiff froth. It 
can be baked in puff paste or without. Serve cold. 

APPLE CUSTARD —No. 2. 
Pare, core and quarter half a dozen fine, large 
cooking apples, put them in a double boiler with the 
grated rind of half a large lemon, cook until tender, 
and press through a sieve ; there must be three-quar- 
ters of a pint of the puree. Add an ounce and a half 
of granulated sugar and set it away to get cold. 
Then beat three eggs very light and stir gradually 
into a pint of rich milk alternately with the apple 
puree, add a little cinnamon, pour it into a pudding 
dish and bake about twenty minutes. Serve cold 
with a little cinnamon and sugar sifted over it. 

BAKED APPLE DUMPLINGS. 
Sift a pint of flour with a teaspoonful of baking 
powder and half a teaspoonful of salt. Put a quarter 
of a pint of butter into it and chop it fine with a 
knife; mix it well — do not use the hands; then add 
milk enough to moisten it, about a quarter of a pint. 
Dust a pastry board w^ith flour, take the dough from 
the bowl, roll lightly into a sheet about an eighth of 
an inch thick, cut into squares large enough to hold 
an apple. Pare and core medium sized cooking 

95 



apples, fill with sugar and a little cinnamon, put in 
the middle of the square and draw the corners up 
over the apples, moistening them with a little white 
of egg or water to make them stick. Brush over the 
dumplings with beaten egg and bake in a good oven. 
The time will depend upon the apples — about half an 
hour. Serve with cream. 

APPLE FLOAT. 
Have a pint of apple puree, made from nice tart 
apples, sweetened to taste and flavored with the 
grated rind of lemon and cinnamon, or nutmeg if pre- 
ferred. Set it on the ice that it may be very cold, 
beat the whites of two eggs to a stiff froth and add 
to the puree of apples, and serve with cream. 

APPLES FRIED. 

Wash and wipe some tart cooking apples, cut in 
slices a quarter of an inch thick, core and fry them in 
butter until tender and brown, dredge them v^ith 
sugar and serve hot. 

APPLE MARMALADE. 

Two pounds of tart cooking apples, one pound 
of sugar, one pint of water, one lemon and some 
blanched almonds. Stir the sugar and water to- 
gether and boil it until it springs from the spoon, 
then add the apples pared and cored and cut in small 
pieces, cook until very thick, flavor with the juice 
and grated peel of a small lemon. Turn into a wet 
mould, when cold set on the ice. Turn out on a glass 
dish, stick it thickly over with the blanched almonds, 
garnish with whipped cream and serve with cream. 

APPLE MERINGUE. 

Put a pint of apple sauce, made of tart cooking 

apples, slightly sweetened, into a pudding dish. Beat 

the whites of four eggs to a stiff froth and stir into it 

a cup and a quarter of sugar, flavor with a very little 



extract of lemon — a few drops only — and spread over 
the apple sauce, and bake twenty or twenty-five min- 
utes. Make a custard of the four egg yolks and a 
pint of milk, sweeten to taste and flavor with va- 
nilla. Serve the meringue very cold in the dish in 
which it is baked, with the custard as a sauce in a 
sauceboat or glass pitcher. 

APPLE PUDDING -No. U 
Take some tart cooking apples, pare, core and 
slice them and lay in cold water for a few minutes to 
prevent them from turning dark. Put the apples in 
a porcelain lined or granite saucepan and add water 
as deep as the apples, but not to cover them. Cover 
the saucepan tightly and let the apples cook until 
tender, then mash well, add sugar, grated lemon peel 
and cinnamon to taste. Put it back on the stove, 
and when it comes to a boil add a tablespoonful of 
potato flour mixed with a little cold w^ater, stir well 
and let it cook for a few^ minutes. Turn it into a 
mould and serve the next day with cream. 

APPLE PUDDING.-No. 2. 
Prepare the apples as for Apple Pudding, No. 1. 
When tender mash through a colander, and put the 
puree back on the stove. When it boils stir in a very 
heaping tablespoonful of potato flour mixed with a 
little cold water, and let it cook for a few minutes. 
Remove from the fire, stir in a wine glass of sherry. 
Turn into a mould, set it on the ice until the next 
day and serve with cream. 

APPLES STEWED IN BUTTER. 
Take half a dozen good, tart cooking apples — 
greenings or Newtown pippins ; peel, cut in slices 
about a quarter of an inch thick and core them. 
Melt an ounce of butter in a spider, and laA^ in the 
slices of apples with a quarter of a pound of granula- 



ted sugar and the juice of a lemon, stew gently over a 
moderate fire. When done arrange them nicely on 
a dish, melt a generous tablespoonful of currant jelly 
in the spider, and when ready to serve mix with it 
half a glass of Madeira or sherry ; pour over the 
apples and serve. 

TO STEAM APPLES. 
Pare and core some good cooking apples, place 
them in an earthen or granite ware dish that fits in 
a steamer. Have water boiling in the steamer, set 
the dish over it, stretch a towel over the top, put on 
the cover and fold the ends of the towel over it. 
Steam the apples until tender — about twenty min- 
utes. Take the apples out, measure the juice in the 
pan and add to it an equal quantity of sugar, flavor 
with a little lemon juice, cook until thick, put the 
apples in a glass dish and pour the syrup over them. 
It will be a jelly when cold. Serve with cream. 

SCALLOPED APPLES. 
Pare, core and cut in slices some good, tart cook- 
ing apples, put a layer in a baking dish with sugar, 
cinnamon and a grating of lemon rind, dot with tiny 
lumps of butter, then another layer of apples, sugar, 
etc., and so on until the dish is full. Add a very little 
water and the juice of a lemon, and use a little more 
sugar and butter on top than on the other layers. 
Bake until the apples are thoroughly cooked. Cover 
until nearly done, when the cover should be removed 
to allow them to brown. Serve hot with cream or 
hard sauce. 

BANANA FRITTERS. 

Half a pint of sweet milk, a scant half pint of 
flour, two rounded teaspoonfuls of baking powder 
and a small pinch of salt, stir all together; this 
should make a batter as thick as that of cake. Roll 
the pieces of fruit in it with a fork, and drop quicklj^ 



into boiling fat. The batter should be prepared just 
as it is wanted and not allowed to stand. Cut three 
medium-sized bananas into three pieces each and 
divide each slice lengthwise so that the fruit will be 
thin enough to cook thoroughly while the batter is 
browning. This recipe will make eighteen small frit- 
ters. Put them on a hot platter — do not pile up — 
and serve immediately with a fruit sauce. 

BAVARIAN CHERRY CAKE. 
Half a pound of fine, juicy black cherries, five 
tablespoonfuls of fine bread crumbs, five tablespoon- 
fuls of powdered sugar, five eggs and one ounce of 
sweet chocolate grated. Put the grated chocolate in 
a mixing bowl, break an egg into it and add one 
tablespoonful of bread crumbs and one of sugar, beat 
light and break another egg into it, adding another 
tablespoonful of bread crumbs and one of sugar. 
Then separate the three remaining eggs, the yolks 
from the whites, adding one yolk at a time alter- 
nately with bread crumbs and sugar until all are 
used. Add the cherries. Beat the three whites of 
eggs to a stiff froth and fold it in lightly. Butter 
thick a cake mould, sift dried bread crumbs over it, 
turn the cake into it and bake about three-quarters 
of an hour in a moderate oven. Test it as other cake. 
In Bavaria it is served cold, but I think it would also 
be nice hot with fruit sauce. 

CRANBERRY BAVARIAN CREAM. 
Stew one quart of cranberries; while hot rub 
through a sieve ; measure out half a pint, and add 
to it a half cup of granulated sugar. Have a quarter 
of a box of gelatine soaked in a quarter of a cup of 
water one hour, set the bowl over steam entirely to 
dissolve the gelatine, then add the cranberries. Turn 
it into an earthenware bowl, set in a pan of ice 
water and beat until it is perfectly cold and begins 



to thicken, then add half a cup of rich milk and beat 
again, and at the last add half a cup of whipped 
cream. Beat it thoroughly and turn it into a mould 
and set on the ice to congeal. Serve with cream. 
Do not use a tin mould for cranberries. 

A MOULD OF FRESH FRUIT. 
Take enough fresh, ripe currants and raspberries 
to make half a cupful of juice of each, and press 
through a sieve fine enough to retain the seeds ; or 
the fruit may be strained and squeezed through 
cheese cloth. Take also enough ripe cherries to make 
a cupful of juice and mix all together. Put a quart 
of boiling water in a saucepan over the fire with four 
ounces of sugar and two ounces of almonds blanched 
and cut fine. Mix five ounces of arrowroot or the 
same quantity of potato flour with the cold fruit 
juices, stir it into the boiling water and let it boil 
about five minutes, turn it into a wet mould, and 
when cold set on the ice. This should be made the 
day before it is to be served. Serve with cream. 

A DESSERT OF MIXED FRUIT. 

Peel some sweet, juicy oranges, removing all the 

white, bitter skin, cut in thin slices and put a layer at 

the bottom of a glass dish, sprinkle with sugar, then 

put a layer of freshly grated cocoanut and a layer of 

bananas, cut in thin slices, and repeat, beginning 

again with oranges, until the bowl is full, finishing 

with a layer of cocoanut. Pour over it any juice 

that may have run from the oranges, and if liked a 

glass or two of sherry may be added. Serve very 

cold. 

GOOSEBERRY PUDDING. 

Use either ripe or unripe English gooseberries for 

this pudding, stem and pick off the flow^er, wash and 

cover with water and cook until tender, strain 

through a sieve. Return to the fire, let it come to a 



boil, sweeten to taste, flavor with cinnamon and 
some almonds blanched and cut fine. Stiffen with 
potato flour as in other fruit puddings— a table- 
spoonful to a quart of the puree — and mould and 
serve in the same way. 

PINEAPPLE MERINGUE. 

Half a large or one small pineapple grated, two 
ounces of butter, three of granulated sugar, an ounce 
and a half of grated bread crumbs, the yolks of three 
eggs and the whites of four. Cream the butter and 
sugar, add the yolks and one white of egg beaten 
well together, then the fruit and bread crumbs ; turn 
into a pudding dish and bake twenty minutes. Beat 
three whites of eggs to a stiff" froth and add three- 
quarters of a cup of granulated sugar to it, flavor 
with a few drops of almond extract, spread over the 
pudding, set the dish in a pan of warm water in the 
oven and bake about ten or fifteen minutes. Test 
with a straw; when it comes out clean it is done. 
Serve cold. 

PRUNE SOUFFLE. 

Soak three-quarters of a pound of prunes in 
water to cover them over night, cook until soft in 
the water they ^were soaked in, drain, take out the 
stones and press through a puree sieve. Add half a 
cup of granulated sugar and the whites of three eggs 
beaten to a stiff froth. Bake in a pudding dish 
twent}' minutes. Serve in the dish in which it is 
baked, cold, with cream. 

PRUNE MOULD. 
Prepare a prune pur^e as above and to the same 
quantity have a third of a box of gelatine soaked in 
a little of the water the prunes were cooked in, and 
dissolved over the teakettle. Stir quickly into the 
puree, then add three whites of eggs beaten to a stiff 
froth. Wet a mould and pour the mixture into it; 



set on the ice to congeal. Turn out on a glass dish 
and serve with cream. 

STEWED DRIED FIGS. 
Wash and cut in half two dozen dried figs, slice 
very thin one small lemon, add to the figs, put in a 
saucepan and pour over them cold water almost to 
cover. Let them cook until the lemon is clear. 
Sweeten to taste. 

RHUBARB MERINGUE. 
Take three cups of stewed rhubarb, put in a 
saucepan over the fire, sweeten to taste, and when 
hot add two ounces of butter and three ounces of 
bread crumbs dried and rolled fine, the juice and rind 
of half a lemon. Remove from the fire and stir in 
three egg yolks, turn it into a pudding dish, set aside 
while preparing the meringue. Beat the whites of 
three eggs to a stiff froth, add three-quarters of a 
cup of granulated sugar and pour over the rhubarb. 
Set the pudding dish in a pan of hot water in the 
oven and bake ten or fifteen minutes. Test with a 
broom straw; when it comes out of the meringue 
clean it is done. Serve cold with cream. 

SCALLOPED RHUBARB. 
A dozen large stalks of young rhubarb, washed

and the syrup is a rich golden brown. Do not let it 
get too dark or it will be bitter. When the milk is at 
the boiling point stir in half the boiling syrup-if nut 
m too fast the milk will boil oyer. Let it cook until 
the sugar (if it hardened as it touched the milk) dis- 



solves. Have four eggs beaten very light in a bowl, 
pour the milk over them, add a little salt, and if 
vanilla bean is not used for flavoring, stir in extract 
of vanilla to taste. Rinse a mould with cold water, 
pour the custard into it and set it in a pan of hot 
water in the oven, bake from twenty to twenty-five 
minutes and test with a knife. If it comes out clean 
it is done. Add boiling water to the remainder of

fuls in egg-shape, turn them over in the hot milk for 
a few seconds, repeat until all are done, drain them 
and return the milk to the saucepan. Beat the six 
egg yolks to a light cream, turn the hot milk over it 
gradually and pour the custard back into the boiler ; 
return to the fire and stir vigorously until it thickens 
and is smooth to the taste. Remove from the fire, 
pour at once into a bowl, add a little salt, and set 
aside to cool. Then put on the ice and at serving 
time turn into a glass bowl, arrange the whites of 
eggs on top and serve with sponge cake. 

A SIMPLE DESSERT. 
A loaf of stale sponge cake — one that has been 
baked in a border mould looks pretty. Saturate the 
cake with orange juice to w^hich has been added a 
little lemon. Stick the cake over v^ith blanched 
almonds and fill the center with whipped cream. If 
the cake is a plain loaf, pile the cream around it.

of milk for half an hour, then place the bowl over 
steam until the gelatine is perfectly dissolved. Add 
to it four ounces of granulated sugar and a pint of

and a small pinch of salt. Flour the raisins with a 
little white flour, mix all the ingredients thoroughly 
together, butter a mould and steam three hours. 
Serve with a sauce. If there should be any of the 
pudding left over, it can be used by cutting in slices 
half an inch thick, each piece dipped in milk, in which 
an egg has been stirred, fried brown in a little butter, 
and served hot with a sauce.

a little salt, mix until smooth, then stir in the whites 
of three eggs beaten to a stiff froth. Have some 
melted butter, brush over the bottom of a frying pan 
and pour a little of the batter into it, let it cover the 
bottom of the pan without being thicker than paper, 
let it brown, turning it to brown the other side, 
spread with any jelly preferred, fold in half and fold 
again, making a wedge-shaped cake. Use all the 



batter in this way, and serve hot. It would be well 
to have two spiders in use.

well buttered mould sprinkled thoroughly with fine 
sifted bread crumbs. Set the mould in a pan of boil- 
ing water in the oven, cover to prevent browning,

from the fire and let it cool. Then stir in an ounce 
and a half of sugar, three heaping tablespoonfuls of 
almonds blanched and chopped and a little vanilla 
to flavor — vanilla sugar is better than the extract — 
then mix in five well beaten eggs, a little at a time. 
Turn it into a well buttered mould sprinkled with 
dried and sifted bread crumbs, set in a pan of hot 
v^ater in the oven, cover to prevent browning and 
bake about three-quarters of an hour. Serve hot

Cakes. 

CAKE MAKING. 
Have all the ingredients measured or weighed, 
the pans lined with paper or oiled, the nuts or fruit 
prepared, and the flour sifted before beginning to 
make a cake. Sift the baking powder and cream of 
tartar and soda with the flour or a part of it. Use 
pastry flour for all cake. Never put all the milk into 
a cake batter bj' itself, as it curdles and makes a 
coarse grained cake, but stir it in alternateh^ with 
the flour. Put all loaves of cake into a moderate 
oven, that thej^ may rise before beginning to bake. 
After the cake rises the heat may be increased. 

ANGEL CAKE.

into the whites of the eggs, and add a teaspoonful of 
vanilla. Have flour sifted five times, measure a cup- 
ful and fold it in very carefulh', not with a circular 
motion, and do not stir long. Turn it into a Turk's 
head mould and bake forty-five minutes. Do not 
grease the mould, and when taken out of the oven 
invert it until the cake is cold before removing from 
the pan. Never use a patent egg-beater for this cake, 
but a whip, taking long, rapid strokes, and make it 
in a large platter, not a bowl.

stiff froth. Put the sugar and water over the fire and 
boil until it threads from the spoon ; then turn it into 
the beaten egg, beat briskly for a few minutes, flavor 
with vanilla, lemon or almond, according to the cake. 
While the cake is still warm, sprinkle with flour and 
spread the icing on with a broad knife. 



Pies. 

PLAIN PASTRY. 
Four cups of sifted flour, one cup of butter, a 
pinch of salt, three heaping teaspoonfuls of granu- 
lated sugar, two tablespoonfuls of lemon juice, four 
tablespoonfuls of ice water and the yolks of two 
eggs. This quantity will make two pies. Rub the 
butter, flour, salt and sugar together thoroughly, 
then add the yolks of eggs, lemon juice and water 
and work all together into a paste. Put the dough 
on a pastry board, divide in four equal parts, roll 
each part the size required for the pie plates. 

PUFF PASTE. 
One pound of flour, one pound of butter and one 
cup of ice water. Sift the flour, weigh it and turn 
into a mixing bowl ; pour the water gradually into 
it, stirring constantly with a spoon ; turn the dough 
out on the pastry board and beat or knead it until it 
blisters and is so elastic that it can be stretched 
without tearing. Then set it away on ice. Wash 
the butter, squeeze out the salt and water and lay it 
on a plate on ice. Roll the dough as nearly square 
as possible, lay the butter in the center of it, fold 
over one side of the paste, then the other, flatten 
slightly with the rolling pin, fold over the ends of 
the dough until they meet ; turn the dough over and 
roll twice, fold again and put the paste on the ice ; 
let it remain for twenty minutes. Repeat this twice, 
allowing the pastry to rest twenty minutes each 
time. This makes in all six rolls and three times of 
rohing. Press very lightly with the rolling pin, cut 
off each time what is needed for a pie or number of 



patties, that the dough will not be worked over 
more than is necessary. The trimmings may be 
used for cheese straws by cutting and sprinkling 
them with grated Parmesan cheese and a dash of 
cayenne pepper; or may be baked in crescents for 
garnishing. In baking, rinse the pans with cold 
water and brush the pastry over with beaten egg. 
Make the pastry in a cool room. 

TO MAKE ONE SQUASH OR PUMPKIN PIE. 
One cup of squash, one egg mixed unbeaten with 
the squash, a cup and a half of sugar, one milk 
cracker rolled fine, half a teaspoonful each of ginger, 
cinnamon and nutmeg, a pinch of salt and a dash of 
cayenne pepper. After these are well mixed, add half 
a cup of milk. Bake in either puff or plain paste. 

SWEET RISSOLES. 
Roll out some puff paste into a thin sheet, cut as 
many rounds w^ith a large patty cutter as are 
needed; put a spoonful of any kind of jam, straw- 
berry, raspberry, currant, etc., or mince meat or 
puree of apples on each, moisten the edges of the 
pastry with water, fold one -half over the other, 
making them into half moons, brush with beaten 
egg and bake in a quick oven. They may be varied 
by sifting coarse sugar and nuts over them before 

baking. 

RICHMOND MAIDS OF HONOR.

the grated rind of two lemons, and a little nutmeg. 
Mix the curds and butter together, beat sugar and 
eggs to a cream, add the potato mashed smooth and 
fine, the almonds, the grated rind and juice of lemon 



and the nutmeg ; beat well and add to the curds and 
butter, mix thoroughly and bake in tartlet pans or 
pie plates lined with puff paste. 

CHEESE CAKES. 
Put a pint of milk on to boil, beat four eggs light 
and stir into the milk ; when it is a thick curd remove 
from the fire and when cool mash it very fine, add to 
it four ounces of breadcrumbs. Beat to a cream half 
a pound of butter and half a pound of sugar, add the 
curds and bread ; beat four eggs until very thick and 
light and pour them into this mixture ; then add 
gradually one tablespoonful of sherry and one of 
brandy and one of rose-water, and a teaspoonful of 
cinnamon, and lastly a quarter of a pound of cur- 
rants well washed. Line either pie plates or shallow 
cake pans with puff paste, pour in the mixture and 
bake in a quick oven. They should be served cold 
and eaten the day they are baked. 

COCOANUT PIE (a Southern Recipe). 
One cup of freshly-grated cocoanut, one cup of 
sugar, three eggs, half a lemon, juice and grated rind, 
one-half cup of cream, one-half cup of butter and one- 
half cup of cocoanut milk. Beat butter and sugar to 
a cream, add other ingredients, the j^olks of eggs beat- 
en very light with the cream, the lemon juice and rind 
and lasth^ the whites of eggs beaten to a stiff" froth. 
Line a dish with puff paste, pour the mixture in and 
bake in a moderate oven three-quarters of an hour. 

LEMON PIE (a Southern Recipe). 
The yolks of four eggs beaten to a cream with one 
cup of granulated sugar and the grated rind of one 
lemon. Peel the lemon,removing every particle of white 
skin, cut into thin slices; have a pie plate lined with 
puff paste, arrange the slices of lemon on the paste, 
add enough milk to the eggs and sugar to fill the 



plate, pour it in, and bake until set. Beat the 
w^hites of eggs to a stiff froth, and stir in two large 
heaping tablespoonfuls of sugar, put on top of the 
pie and bake a light brown. 

MINCE MEAT. 
One pound of granulated sugar, one pound of 
raisins, one pound of currants, half a pound of citron, 
half a dozen lemons, grated rind and juice, the pulp of

mon, an even teaspoonful of allspice, a quarter of a 
teaspoonful of cloves, an even teaspoonful of salt, 
three-quarters of a pound of butter incited, a cup and 
a half of sherry and a cup of brandy. Seed the rai- 
sins and soak them with the currants in just 
water enough to cover, stew until tender, and 
add when cold wdth the water to the other ingredi- 
ents. Mix thoroughly, stirring in the melted butter 
at the last. Let it stand for several days. The 
brandy and wane may be omitted and more lemons 
and oranges used to flavor it. At each baking it is 
well to add a little sugar and chopped apple. This 
will keep all w^inter or longer in a cool place, if the 
brandy and wine are not omitted. 




Candies, 

CHOCOLATE CARAMELS— No. I. 
Six pounds of light brown sugar, one pound of 
butter, one pound of chocolate, one pint of cream, 
one pint of milk, paraffine as large as a walnut, one 
teaspoonful of cream of tartar. Flavor with vanilla.

brittle in water ; flavor and pour into buttered tins 
and mark in squares before it is quite cold. 

CHOCOLATE CARAMELS.— No. 2. 
One pint of fresh milk, three ounces of chocolate, 
grated, two pounds of granulated sugar, half a tea- 
spoonful of cream of tartar. Stir until melted, then 
add half a pint of cream, cook until the mixture is

A quarter of a pound of chocolate, grated, one 
large cup of granulated sugar, one cup of milk and a 
heaping tablespoonful of butter, a quarter of a tea- 
spoonful of cream of tartar. Boil all together, stir- 
ring all the time, until the syrup hardens in cold 
water, and just before taking from the fire add a tea- 
spoonful of vanilla. Beat the syrup as soon as re- 
moved from the fire, and keep it up until it is too stiff 
to beat any longer — if it is beaten a minute and a 
half it will do well. Turn out of the saucepan into a 
greased pan and before it is quite cold cut in squares. 

CHOCOLATE CREAM PEPPERMINTS. 
Mix together two cups of granulated sugar and 
half a cup of cream, boil until it holds well together 

141 



in cold water, or can be rolled between the fingers, 
flavor with oil of peppermint, remove from the fire 
and stir until the cream is stiff enough to mould into 
balls. Use powdered sugar on the hands while 
moulding. Melt an ounce of chocolate and dip the 
balls, w^hich should be as large as hazel nuts, in this, 
using a long pin for the purpose, and lay them on 
paraffine paper. Any flavoring may be used instead 
of peppermint. 

CANDY (to PuU). 

Two cupfuls of granulated sugar, half a cup of 
water, one tablespoonful of vinegar, butter the size 
of a w^alnut. Boil the sugar and w^ater without stir- 
ring until it is brittle v^hen tried in cold water, add 
the butter and vinegar just before it is done. Flavor 
with anj^ extract preferred, pour into buttered soup 
plates, and when cool enough to handle pull until 
white. 

CHESTNUTS GLACE. 

Skin the chestnuts and cover with cold water, let 
them cook gently until tender, when a large needle 
can be run through them easily. Drain and drop 
them in cold water. After two hours drain again 
and put them in a bowl, cover them w^ith a rich syrup 
that has been skimmed and boiled until clear. It 
must be boiling when poured over the chestnuts. 
Cover the bowl with a heav}^ paper and let it stand 
for twelve hours, drain off the syrup, bring it to the 
boiling point and turn it over the chestnuts again 
and put aw^aj^ for another twelve hours. Repeat this 
process three times, then drain the syrup ofl" and the 
chestnuts are ready for use. Use the large imported 
chestnuts, remove the shells and boil the nuts. The 
brown skin can then be easily removed with a pen- 
knife. They are very nice but very troublesome to 
prepare.

COCOANUT CAKES. 
One pound of granulated sugar, half a pound of 
grated cocoanut, half a cup of water and a salt- 
spoonful of cream of tartar. Boil the sugar and

Put a tablespoonful of dried hoarhound leaves in 
a cup and pour over them half a cupful of boiling 
water, cover and let it steep until cold, strain and 
pour it over a pound of granulated sugar and a 
tablespoonful of vinegar. Boil without stirring, and 
if any scum rises to the top remove it. Test the 
candy in cold water, when brittle remove from the 
fire and pour into a buttered pan. Mark into 
squares before it is cold, or break into irregular 
pieces. 

MARSHMALLOWS. 

Pow^der very fine eight ounces of gum arable, 
dissolve it in three gills of water over a slow fire and 
strain. Simmer an ounce and a half of marshmal- 
low roots in two gills of water, for ten minutes, 
closely covered. Strain and reduce to one gill. Add 
this w^ith half a pound of sugar to the dissolved 
gum. Boil until it becomes a thick paste, stirring 
constantly. Add the whites of four eggs beaten to a 
stiff froth and a teaspoonful of vanilla extract. Re-

Dissolve the sugar in a spider over the fire without 
water, stirring constantly, and when entireh^ melted 
mix in the nuts quickly and pour at once into a well 
greased pan, and before it is cold mark in squares. 
This is very nice pounded fine in a mortar or ground 
in a mill to sprinkle over custards just before serving. 

PANOCHE (a Spanish Recipe). 

Two cups of dark brown sugar, one cup of chopped 
walnuts, half a cup of milk, butter the size of a

turn out on paraffine paper, and break it or cut in 
pieces. 

PEPPERMINT DROPS. 

Two cups of granulated sugar, half a cup of cold 
water, a tiny pinch of cream of tartar. Boil ten 
minutes without stirring, let the sugar melt slowly 
that it may not burn. Add eight drops of oil of pep- 
permint ^"hile still on the fire. When removed from 
the stove beat with an egg-beater until it falls in 
long drops, when drop quickty on parafline paper. 

PRALINES.

pounds of granulated sugar, two pounds of seeded 
raisins, the pulp of six oranges cut in small pieces, 
and the rind of two oranges cut fine. Boil three- 
quarters of an hour. Grapes can be used instead of 
currants or cherries. 

RED CURRANT JAM. 
Pick the currants from the stems, weigh them, and 
allow three-quarters of a pound of white sugar to a 
pound of the fruit. Put the currants in a preserving 
kettle, mash them a little to prevent them from stick- 
ing to the kettle, and boil for fifteen minutes, then 
add the sugar and boil rapidly for ten minutes. 
Bottle and seal tight. 

RED CURRANT JELLY. 
Berries for jelly must be picked "when the weather 
is dry. Pick them over, taking out all leaves, etc., 
put them in the kettle and mash them a little to get 
enough juice to keep them from burning; stir con- 
stantly, and as soon as hot wring them dry through 
a cheese cloth. Measure the liquid and to every pint 
of juice allow one pound of sugar. Put the juice on 
the fire and boil fifteen minutes, then add the sugar 
and boil fifteen minutes more, skimming thoroughly. 
Pour into glasses while hot ; let them stand until the 
next day and cover. Very often jelly is soft, and 
alw^ays from one of two reasons : either the berries 
have been picked immediately after a rain or the 
sugar is adulterated. 



RED CURRANT SYRUP. 
The currants must be fresh and perfectly ripe and 
picked in dry weather. Wash and put them in either 
a porcelain-lined or a granite-ware kettle, stir until 
they are tender, as for currant jelly, then remove from 
the fire and wring them as dry as possible in a cheese 
cloth. Measure the juice and return it to the fire, let 
it cook fifteen minutes, then add a poimd of granu- 
lated sugar to each quart of juice, boil gently fifteen 
minutes, skimming as long as the scum rises. Bottle 
and cork well and keep in a dark place. Raspberry 
and strawberry syrup are made in the same way, 
only mashing and straining the fruit and measuring 
the juice before cooking. 

BLACK CURRANT SYRUP. 
Pick from the stems and mash them, a few at a 
time, in a bowl or granite saucepan with a potato 
masher, then put them in a stone jar and let then? 
stand for two days, stirring well each day. Wrin;^ 
them through a cheese cloth, and if wanted sweet 
cook with sugar as red currant syrup. The juice can 
be bottled without sugar or cooking, and will keep 
for years. It is used for sauces or fruit soups, etc. 

CRANBERRY JAM. 
Put five quarts of cranberries in a preserving 
kettle with two quarts of water and boil gently until 
the fruit is tender, then add three pounds and three- 
quarters of granulated sugar, boil until the fruit is 
clear, skimming carefully. Put in glasses and when 
cold seal. It keeps well. 

GOOSEBERRY JELLY. 
Use the large English gooseberries and follov^ 
directions for currant jelly. 



GOOSEBERRY JAM. 
Three-quarters of a pound of sugar to every 
pound of fruit. Put the fruit on by itself in a porce- 
lain-Hned or granite-ware saucepan, mash and stir 
well to keep from burning, and boil one hour. Then 
add the sugar and boil one hour more. 

GRAPE JAM. 
Press -with the fingers the pulp from grapes — 
Muscat or Concord grapes make the best jam — seed 
and measure them, allowing a cup of sugar to each 
cup of fruit. Put the skins on and cook until tender, 
when almost done add the pulp, and when all is ten- 
der add the sugar and boil until thick. 

PINEAPPLE JAM. 
Pare the fruit and carefully take out the ej^es, 
then grate it on a coarse grater, rejecting the cores, 
weigh it, and to each pound of fruit take a pound of 
sugar. Sprinkle it over the grated pines, let it stand 
over night. In the morning, boil for ten or fifteen 
minutes over a quick fire. Put in tumblers and when 
cold cover. 

RASPBERRY OR STRAWBERRY JAM. 
Allow three-quarters of a pound of sugar to a 
pound of fruit. Put the fruit in a preserving kettle 
over the fire and boil fifteen minutes, mashing a little 
to prevent sticking to the kettle. Then add the sugar 
and boil ten minutes, skimming carefully ; turn into 
glasses and seal when cold. 

ORANGE MARMALADE. 
Select smooth, thin-skinned, juicj^ oranges. Take 
tvirentj'-one, and five lemons. Cut the rind very thin 
from a third of the fruit, and boil it in two quarts of 
water until it can be pierced easily with a broom 
straw. Drain from the water and cut in fine strips 



with scissors, add this to the pulp of the oranges and 
lemons after removing all the white bitter skin and 
pips from the fruit. Weigh and allow a pound of 
sugar to a pound of fruit, put in a porcelain-lined or 
granite-ware kettle and cook until clear. Put in 
glasses and when cold cover with brandied paper 
and seal. 

PUMPKIN CHIPS. 
Slice very thin and chip about four pounds of 
pumpkin, put in an earthenware bowl, and cover it 
over night with four and a half pounds of granulated 
sugar and the juice of one dozen lemons. Boil the 
lemon peel until tender and cut in small thin chips 
and add to the juice, etc. In the morning, boil to- 
gether until perfectly clear and crisp. 




Pickles, Sauces, etc. 



RIPE CUCUMBER PICKLE. 
Pare and seed the cucumbers. Slice each cucum- 
ber lengthwise in four pieces or cut it in fanc}' shapes, 
cover with cold vinegar and let them stand for twen- 
ty-four hours. Drain and put them in fresh vinegar 
with two pounds of sugar, and one ounce of cassia 
buds to one quart of vinegar. Boil for twenty min- 
utes and put in jars. 

SWEET PICKLED PEACHES. 

Select fine, fresh, ripe, but not soft peaches, peel 

and weigh them. To every seven pounds of fruit take 

five pounds of granulated sugar, a pint of vinegar, 

two tablespoonfuls of cinnamon and one tablespoon- 

fiil of cloves, tie the spices up in a muslin bag, add a 

fe'w pieces of stick cinnamon and a few allspice. Put 

the fruit in a stone jar, bring the sugar, vinegar and 

spice to a boil, pour over the peaches, cover and let 

them stand until the next day, scald the sj^rup again 

and pour over the fruit, and so on, until it has been 

done in all seven times. Take out the bag of spice 

and put the fruit with the syrup into jars and seal. 

These are much more delicious than peaches that are 

cooked.

beans. 

MUSTARD PICKLES. 

One quart each of tiny whole cucumbers, large 
cucumbers sliced, green tomatoes sliced and small 
button onions, one large cauliflower divided into 
flowerettes, and four green peppers cut fine. Make a 
brine of four quarts of water and one pint of salt, 
pour it over the mixed vegetables and let it stand

fine cooking salt, half a pound of ground mustard, 
one ounce of cloves, t^wo green peppers, two or three 
onions and one pound of brown sugar. Pierce the 
tomatoes with a silver fork or broom straw, put 
them in a stone jar with salt in alternate layers. 
Throw away all the liquor made by standing one 
week. Return to jar and cover with cold water, 
cover and let it stand twenty-four hours. Drain 
again thoroughly, throw away the water, return the

with the peppers, onions and horse radish chopped, 
and sprinkle the mustard seeds over all. Tie the 
spices in a thin muslin bag and cover the whole with 



best wine vinegar, boil until tender and clear in ap- 
pearance. The peppers should have all the seeds 
removed. Half a cup of dry mustard is considered 
by some an improvement. 

GOOSEBERRY CATSUP.

In making sauces great care should be taken to 
have the saucepans scrupulously clean and only 
granite- ware or porcelain-lined saucepans should be 
used, especially where there is any acid as in toma- 
toes or pickles. Never use an iron spider except for 
browning butter and flour together as they will not 
brown in a saucepan. 

VEGETABLE STOCK FOR SAUCES. 

Take any kinds of vegetables convenient, such as 
parsnips, celer>% carrots, turnips, green pepper, onion, 
leek, parsley, celery tops, celery root, Jerusalem arti- 
chokes, a bay leaf, two cloves, two allspice, and cook 
in water until tender; strain, pressing all from the 
vegetables. The water Jerusalem artichokes are 
boiled in is valuable for sauces. The liquid from 
canned peas is also excellent. Care must be taken in 
putting the vegetables together not to let any one 
predominate, turnip especially, as it makes a sauce 
very bitter. 

COLORING FOR SAUCES, SOUPS, Etc. 

Melt a quarter of a pound of granulated sugar in 
a spider, cook until it is a very dark, rich brown, 
almost black, stir constantly. Great care must be 
taken that it does not burn. When done pour over 
it a quart of boiling water and let it cook until the 
caramel is entirely dissolved, pour it out and when 
cold strain and bottle. It will keep indefinitely and 
a tablespoonful will give color to a pint of liquid. 

OLIVE SAUCE. 
Melt a heaping tablespoonful of butter in a 
spider and when it begins to brown stir into it a 



heaping tablespoonful of flour, let it cook until a 
very dark brown, but be careful not to let it burn, 
then add enough rich vegetable stock to make a, 
thick cream-like sauce. Have ready some olives — six 
or seven, that have been boiled a few minutes in 
water and cut from the stones, add these to the 
sauce, season with pepper and salt to taste, bring to 
the boiling point and serve. 

SAUCE HOLLANDAISE. 
One-quarter of a pound of butter, one-quarter of 
a cup of w^ater, one-quarter of a teaspoonful of salt, 
the juice of a quarter of a lemon, a dash of cayenne, 
and the yolks of three eggs. Beat the butter to a 
cream and stir in the 3'olks of eggs, one at a time, 
then the lemon juice, salt and pepper. Set the bowl 
it is mixed in in a pan of boiling water on the fire, 
beating constantly with an egg beater, and when it 
begins to thicken stir in gradually the boiling water. 
When it is as thick as soft custard it is done. Great 
care must be taken not to let it remain too long on 
the fire or it will curdle. 

DRAWN BUTTER OR CREAM SAUCE. 
Melt a large heaping tablespoonful of butter and 
stir into it a heaping teaspoonful of flour, let them 
cook together without browning and add by degrees 
a cup of hot milk. 

CURRY SAUCE. 
Curry sauce is made by adding curry powder to 
taste to a white sauce. It may likewise be added to 
a brow^n sauce. 

CHEESE SAUCE. 
A white or cream sauce with grated Parmesan 
cheese added to taste. 



TOMATO SAUCE. 
Melt a large tablespoonful of butter in a saucepan 
over the fire, when it bubbles put into it a small onion 
and half a green pepper, if convenient, chopped verj^ 
fine. Simmer gently for a few minutes, then stir in a 
heaping teaspoonful of flour, and add four nice, fresh 
tomatoes peeled and cut small — canned tomatoes 
may be used — a gill of vegetable stock, a clove and 
part of a bay leaf, and pepper and salt to taste. Let 
it cook gently for half an hour and press through a 
fine sieve. 

SAUCE TARTARE 

maj^ be made by beating a small tablespoonful of 
butter to a cream, adding salt, pepper, dry mustard 
and sugar to taste and the raw jo\k of an egg. Add 
a tablespoonful of olives, small cucumbers and capers 
chopped very fine and a few drops of onion juice. 
Serve with mock fish cutlets and croquettes. 

SAUCE PIQUANTE. 
Melt a heaping tablespoonful of butter in a spider 
and when it bubbles stir into it a heaping table- 
spoonful of flour, cook until it turns a dark brown, 
taking care not to let it burn, add to it enough well- 
seasoned vegetable stock to make the sauce the 
proper consistencj-, then pour it into a granite-ware 
saucepan and add one small cucumber pickle, two 
olives and a few capers, all chopped very fine ; season 
with salt and pepper to taste. 



Sandwiches. 



CHEESE SANDWICHES. 
Half a pound of grated cheese, one tablespoonful 
of butter, the 3'olks of two hard-boiled eggs mashed 
very fine and a teaspoonful of mayonnaise dressing. 
Mix the ingredients thoroughly; butter before cut- 
ting from the loaf some slices of brown or white 
home-made bread ; spread with the mixture and fold 
together. 

CELERY SANDWICHES. 
Use dainty little baking powder biscuits freshly 
baked but cold, or white home-made bread for these 
sandwiches. Only the very tender part of celery 
should be used and chopped fine and put in iced water 
until needed. Add a few chopped walnuts to the 
celery and enough mayonnaise dressing to hold them 
together; butter the bread before cutting from the 
loaf, spread one slice with the mixture and press an- 
other over it. If biscuits are used, split and butter 
them. They should be small and \eiry thin for this 
purpose and bro^^ned delicately. 

NUT AND CREAM CHEESE SANDWICHES. 
Boston brown bread buttered on the loaf and cut 
in very thin slices ; spread with a filling of cream 
cheese and chopped walnut meats ; press a buttered 
slice over it. They may be cut in fingers, rounds or 
half-moons. The proportion is three-quarters of a 
cup of nuts to a ten-cent package of Philadelphia 
cream cheese. This quantity will make a large num- 
ber of sandwiches. 



NUT SANDWICHES. 
Graham, rye, and Boston brown bread make very 
nice sandwiches. Butter the loaf and cut in verj^ thin 
slices, sprinkle with chopped nuts and fold together. 

WHOLE WHEAT BREAD AND PEANUT SANDWICHES. 

Chop the nuts very fine, butter the l^read before 

cutting from the loaf, sprinkle the nuts thicklj' over 

the butter, press two slices together. Boston brown 

bread with raisins is also nice for these sandwiches. 

OLIVE SANDWICHES. 
Prepare the bread and butter as for other sand- 
wiches. It may be cut in squares, rounds or tri- 
angles to suit the fancy. Stone and chop as many 
Queen olives as needed and mix with them enough 
mayonnaise dressing to hold together, spread half 
the number of bread slices with the mixture and 
cover with the other half. 

Brown, rye, whole wheat or white bread may be 
used. Home-made is preferable, but it must be 
twelve hours old. Sandwiches may be sweet or sa- 
vory, may be cut round, square, or in triangles.

Sundries, 

CRACKERS AND CHEESE TOASTED. 
Butter some zepherettes and sprinkle thickly with 
grated Parmesan cheese, bake in a quick oven, or 
toast on a gridiron ; serve hot. 

CRACKERS WITH CREAM CHEESE AND GUAVA JELLY. 

Spread zepherettes with cream cheese and dot 
with Guava jelly. 

WELSH RAREBIT. 

Half a pound of American cheese, two butter 
balls, two eggs, half a teaspoonful of mustard, a salt- 
spoonful of salt, a dash of cayenne pepper, half a cup 
of milk and an even saltspoonful of soda. Cut the 
cheese fine, melt the butter in a chafing dish or spider, 
stir the mustard, salt and pepper with it, then add 
the cheese and milk ; when the cheese is dissolved add 
the eggs slightly beaten and stir until it thickens. 
Serve on toast. 

CHEESE SOUFFLE. 

Melt one tablespoonful of butter in a spider, add 
to it a slightly heaping tablespoonful of flour and one 
cup of hot milk, half a teaspoonful of salt, a dash of 
cayenne pepper and one cup of grated Parmesan 
cheese; then add the yolks of three eggs beaten light, 
remove from the fire and let it cool ; then add the 
whites of eggs beaten stifi', turn into a pudding dish, 
bake twenty-five minutes and serve immediately. 

CHEESE STRAWS. 
Take two ounces of flour and three ounces of 
Parmesan cheese grated (it is better to buy the cheese 
by the pound and have it grated at home), and two 






ounces of butter. Rub the butter into the flour, add 
the cheese and a little salt and cayenne pepper, and 
make into a paste with the yolk of an egg ; roll the 
paste out in a sheet about an eighth of an inch thick 
and five inches wide and cut in narrow strips ; bake 
in a hot oven about ten minutes. 

PATE A CHOU FOR SOUPS. 
Put a gill of milk and an ounce of butter into a 
saucepan over the fire ; when it comes to the boiling 
point add two ounces of sifted flour; stir with a 
wooden spoon until thick and smooth, then add two 
eggs, one at a time, beating briskly; remove from 
the fire and spread out thin, cut in pieces, the size of 
a small bean, put them in a sieve, dredge with flour, 
shake it well and frjnn boiling fat until a nice brown. 
Add to the soup after it is in the tureen. 

A HLLING FOR PATTIES. 
Break two eggs in a bowl, add a little salt and 
white pepper, a few drops of onion juice and four 
tablespoonfuls of cream, beat slightly; turn into a 
buttered tin cup, stand in a saucepan with a little 
boiling water in it on the stove, cover and cook until 
stiff— about three or four minutes — remove from the 
fire, turn out of the cup. When ready to use cut in 
half-inch slices and then into stars or any fancy shape 
preferred, or into dice. Make a cream sauce thicker 
than for other uses, that it may not run through the 
pastry ; put them in the sauce, bring to the boiling 
point and fill the patties just as they are to be served. 

GRUEL OF KERNEL FLOUR OR MIDDLINGS. 
Put a pint of boiling water in a saucepan over 
the fire ; mix two heaping teaspoonfuls of the flour 
with a little cold water and stir into the boiling 
water. Let it boil twenty minutes, add a little cream 
to it and salt. Very nutritious.

KOUMYSS. 
Dissolve a third of a cake of compressed yeast in 
a little tepid water; take a quart of milk, fresh from 
the cow, or warmed to blood heat, and add to it a 
tablespoonful of sugar and the dissolved yeast. Put 
the mixture immediately in beer bottles with patent 
stoppers, filling to the neck, and let them stand for 
twelve hours where bread would be set to rise— that 
is, in a temperature of 68 or 70 degrees— then stand 
the bottles upside down on ice until wanted. 

HOME-MADE BAKING POWDER. 
Procure from a reliable druggist one-half pound 
of the best bicarbonate of soda, one pound of cream 
of tartar and one-half pound of Kingsford's corn- 
starch. Mix thoroughly and sift three times, put up 
in small tins. The best baking powder. 

VANILLA EXTRACT. 

One ounce of Mexican vanilla bean, two ounces 
of loaf sugar, eight ounces of French rose water, 
twenty-four ounces of alcohol 95 per cent. Cut up 
the bean and pound with the sugar in a mortar, sift 
and pound again until all is a fine powder. Mix the 
alcohol and rose water; put the vanilla in a paper 
filter, pour over it a little of the liquid at a time until 
all is used ; filter again if not all is dissolved. Paper 
filters may be obtained at any of the large drug 
stores. The extract may be darkened by using a 
little caramel. 

VANILLA SUGAR. 

Half a pound of loaf sugar, half an ounce of 
Mexican vanilla beans. Cut the beans very fine, 
pound in a mortar with the sugar; sift and pound 
again until all is fine. Bottle and cork tight and 
keep in a dark place. 






SPINACH FOR COLORING. 
Pound some spinach in a mortar, adding a little 
water ; squeeze through a cheese cloth, put in a sauce- 
pan over the fire, bring to a boil ; when it curdles re- 
move from the stove. Strain through a very fine 
sieve ; what remains on the under part of the sieve 
is the coloring. It is used for coloring pistache ice 
cream, jellies, etc. 

TOMATO PASTE FOR SANDWICHES. 
Skin and cut small three large tomatoes, cook 
until tender and press through a sieve fine enough to 
retain the seeds ; return to the fire, add two ounces 
of butter, two ounces of grated bread crumbs and 
two ounces of grated Parmesan cheese. When it 
boils stir a beaten egg quickly into it, remove at once 
from the fire. It must not boil after the egg is added, 
as it will curdle. Turn the mixture into a bowd and 
when cold, if it is not for immediate use, cover with 
melted butter. 

CHEESE PASTE FOR SANDWICHES. 
Boil two eggs hard, separate the yolks from the 
whites, mash the yolks smooth and chop the whites 
very fine; mix and put through a vegetable press, 
then add butter the size of a small egg and three 
heaping tablespoonfuls of grated American cheese. 
Beat together until it is a fine, smooth paste. If not 
salt enough add a little, and also drv mustard, if 
liked. 



Miscellaneous Recipes. 

TOOTH POWDER. 
Precipitated chalk, seven ounces; Florentine orris, 
four ounces; bicarbonate of soda, three ounces; po-w- 
dered white Castile soap, two ounces ; thirty drops 
each of oil of wintergreen and sassafras. Sift all to- 
gether and keep in a glass jar or tin box. A very 
valuable recipe for hardening the teeth. 

JAPANESE CREAM. 
Four ounces of ammonia, four ounces of white 
Castile soap cut fine, two ounces of alcohol, two 
ounces of Price's gh^cerine and two ounces of ether. 
Put the soap in one quart of water over the fire; 
vsrhen dissolved add four quarts of water ; when cold 
add the other ingredients, bottle and cork tight. It 
will keep indefinitely. It should be made of soft 
water or rain water. To wash woolens, flannels, 
etc., take a teacup of the liquid to a pail of luke^A,^arm 
water, and rinse in another pail of w^ater with half a 
cup of the cream. Iron while damp on the wrong 
side. For removing grass stains, paint, etc., use half 
\vater and half cream. 

ORANGE FLOWER LOTION FOR THE COMPLEXION. 

Dissolve a slightly heaping tablespoonful of Ep- 
som salts in a pint of imported orange flower water 
(Chiris de Grasse), and add to it one tablespoonful 
of witch hazel. Apply with a soft linen cloth. Very 
refreshing in warm "weather and an excellent remedy 
for oiliness of the skin. 

BAY RUM. 

Three-quarters of an ounce of oil of ba3', one 
ounce of loaf sugar, one pint of alcohol, 95 per cent., 



two quarts of new New England rum and three pints 
of rectified spirits, 60 per cent. Roll the sugar until 
fine and beat into the oil of bay, add the alcohol, then 
the New England rum and spirits. Let it stand for 
several days in a demijohn, shaking occasionally; 
then filter through blotting paper. The filters may 
be purchased at a druggist's. Care should be taken 
to buy the oil at a reliable place. 

FINE LAVENDER WATER. 

Two ounces finest oil of lavender, one ounce 
essence of musk, one-half ounce essence of ambergris, 
one-half ounce oil of bergamot and one-half gallon of 
rectified spirits. Mix the ingredients, keep in a demi- 
john for several daj^s, shaking occasionally. Then 
filter and bottle. 

GOOD HARD SOAP. 

Five pounds of grease, one quart and one cup of 
cold v^ater, one can of potash, one heaping table- 
spoonful of borax, two tablespoonfuls of ammonia. 
Dissolve the potash in the water, then add the borax 
and ammonia and stir in the lukewarm grease slowly 
and continue to stir until it becomes as thick as thick 
honey ; then pour into a pan to harden. When firm 
cut into cakes. Grease that is no longer fit to fry in 
is used for this soap. Strain it carefully that no par- 
ticles of food are left in it. It makes no difference 
how brown the grease is, the soap will become white 
and float in water. It should be kept a month before 
using. 

POLISH FOR HARD OR STAINED WOOD FLOORS. 

Eight ounces of yellow beeswax, two quarts of 
spirits" of turpentine, one quart of Venetian turpen- 
tine. Cut the wax in small pieces and pour the 
spirits over it— it will soon dissolve; then bottle. 
Apply with a flannel or soft cloth. It keeps the floors 
in excellent order.
