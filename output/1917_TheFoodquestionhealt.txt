Publishers' Foreword 

This book was planned before Food Conservation was 
by the mass considered seriously. The writers of the 
various articles are thoroughly qualified to speak where 
they have spoken. They are practical, conscientious, 
Christian, and have at heart the best in the needs of hu- 
manity. Every one strikes a major chord in the song 
of healthful, economical living. The recipes are from the 
author of "Food and Cookery," who has had a score of 
years' experience in every station and phase of the prep- 
aration of food, under French, English, German, and 
Spanish chefs. He has been second cook in the Calumet 
Club of Chicago, the California Club, Los Angeles, and 
in many leading hotels in various cities. For ten years, 
he has given his best thought and study to the prepara- 
tion of the best in food, scientific, palatable, wholesome, 
and economic, most of this time in the Sanitarium and 
College of Medical Missionaries, Loma Linda, California. 
Special attention is called to the valuable tables of Food 
Elements, and to the newly demonstrated values of vita- 
mines and the substances which destroy them. 

We are grateful for the kind word spoken by Dr. Ray 
Lyman Wilbur, president of Stanford University, and 
first assistant to Mr. Hoover in the Federal Food Ad- 
ministration Department; also for the help and sugges- 
tions of Dr. Newton Evans, president of the College of 
Medical Evangelists, of Loma Linda, California. 

The little book will, we believe, not only meet present 
needs, but be a safe counselor in the years to come.

Hoover 




says — 

"T ET the American 
•*-^ woman stop, be- 
fore anything is thrown 
away; and let her ask 
herself, 'Can it be used 
in my home, in some 
other home, or in the 
production of further 
food supply by feeding 
it to animals used also 
for food?' 

"Let her order her 
meals so that there will 
be plenty — for there is 
plenty — but not too 
much. 

"The intelligent woman of America must make a proper 
study of food ratios, so that the most nutritious foods will 
appear in their proper proportions on the home table." 

"The man who complains at the result of his wife's ef- 
forts to conserve food is doing her an inexcusable injury. 
He should never hesitate to cooperate in her wise conserva- 
tion plans."

Wilson says — 



*'TN no direction can they [the women of America] so 
■■• greatly assist as by enlisting in the service of the food 
administration and cheerfully accepting its direction and 
advice. By so doing, they will increase the surplus of food 
available for our own army and for exports to the allies. 
To provide adequate supplies for the coming year is of 
absolutely vital importance to the conduct of the war; and 
without a vei-y conscientious elimination of waste and very 
strict economy in our food consumption, we cannot hope to 
fulfill this primary duty." 




FOOD ECONOMY 

by 

E. A. SUTHERLAND, A.B., M.D. 

of the State Bureau of 
Food Conservation of Tennessee 



From the days of ancient Egypt, when Joseph, who 
stood at the head of the great food conservation movement 
of the time, called the attention of the world to the need 
of food economy, down through history to the present 
time, the human race has passed through numerous crises 
when the questions of food production and food economy 
have been vital. That Hebrew, promoted to the first place 
in the Egyptian empire because of his wonderful grasp of 
a world problem and his executive ability, enabled that 
kingdom to feed the world. America to-day, as Egypt 
of old, is an international granary, and is asked to feed 
the nations ; and her population — every man, woman, and 
child — must cooperate with America's Joseph to-day in 
meeting the situation by proper production, proper con- 
servation, and strict economy. "This war is a food war 
even more than it is a gun war." Let us fight to save 
lives. That is the battle to be won through food economy. 

(7) 



8 The Food Question 

It was when the Roman world was running riot that, 
on the shores of the Sea of Galilee, Christ gave His won- 
derful lesson on the subject of food conservation. We 
call it a miracle when with five thousand men, besides 
the women and the children, seated about Him, He fed 
the multitudes. That same power is to-day, and alwaj^s 
has been, feeding the men of earth. From a basket of 
seed, each recurring harvest puts thousands of loaves of 
bread into the hands of the world's hungry ; the two small 
fishes continue to multiply; rich and poor alike are fed 
by the great Provider. And now as then, after human 
wants are met, the mandate goes forth, "Gather up the 
fragments that remain, that nothing be lost." Economy 
is again being preached as it was once taught on the 
shores of Galilee. There has been started a great edu- 
cational movement for increased food production. But 
that is only a part of the message. ''Gather up the 
fragments," prevent waste, utilize the scraps, the gospel 
of a clean plate, — these are all familiar phrases in the 
great conservation movement of to-day. By many, food 
conservation and food economy are deemed not only na- 
tional problems, but a part of the divine message taught 
by Christ and His disciples. 

The great world war which began in 1914 has com- 
pelled every nation to halt and consider its national habits. 

Undoubtedly the United States is the most prodigal 
of nations. Approximately sixty per cent of its popula- 
tion is now urban. Simple rural life is practically gone ; 
and those artificial and extravagant standards of the city 
which destroy body, mind, and soul have taken its place. 
"Fullness of bread and abundance of idleness," two of 
the reasons assigned by the Scriptures for the downfall 
of Sodom, are conditions which to-day are ruining Ameri- 
can civilization. No other nation has ever indulged such 
extravagance and prodigality as has the United States. 



Food Economy 9 

We search the world over for table delicacies. American 
inventive genius has made it possible to have foods from 
all parts of the world, both in season and out of season. 
The arts of canning and preserving and the making of 
factory foods have loaded our cupboard shelves with eat- 
ables of which our fathers never dreamed. 

Nhile this interchange has its advantages, and we 
should appreciate the privilege of eating the wholesome 
products of other countries, yet when easy methods of 
transportation lead people to limit their productions to 
money crops, forsaking the raising of their own food, a 
wrong principle has been introduced. The benefit to be 
derived from this variety of imported food is neutralized 
by the extravagant habits and tastes thus cultivated. 

Economy of Food Elemeyits 

Man is made from the dust of the earth ; and by di- 
vine law, his body continues to build and rebuild from 
chemically organized soil. To be intelligent, food econo- 
mists require a knowledge of the four food elements, — 
proteins, carbohydrates, fats, and minerals, — and the re- 
lation each sustains to the human body. Later chapters 
contain valuable instruction in these respects. 

It is poor economy to allow valuable mineral salts to 
be removed from flour by milling, from rice by polishing, 
and from vegetables by wrong methods of cooking. These 
minerals are necessary for the development of the child, 
for the preservation of teeth and bones, for high efficiency 
in the nervous system, and for a proper functioning of 
the various organs in the body. There is no economy in 
buying denatured grain, even though it is put up in car- 
tons, at ten times the price of the natural grain. 

"Put a knife to thy throat, if thou be a man given 
to appetite." Stop the immense waste of strength, en- 
ergy, money, and time due to mere gratification of ap- 



10 The Food Question 

petite. Stop preparing food that is intended simply to 
coax the appetite to the point where eating becomes glut- 
tony. In the words of an eminent authority, "Most men 
would attain better health and greater efficiency if they 
would reduce their rations by twenty-five per cent or 
more." The celebrated Dr. Osier tells us that "we eat 
too much after forty years of age," and he advises every 
v/ise man to restrict his eating as he grows older, "and 
at last descend out of life as he ascended into it, even 
into a child's diet." 

Overeating 

Food economy is not a call to a starvation diet, but 
to a balanced ration of wholesome, well prepared food. 
Overeating of even the best food produces poisons that 
injure the tissues, overwork the organs of digestion, and 
in time may bring the body to actual starvation conditions. 

A man's appetite is not always a safe guide. Arti- 
ficial surroundings in childhood make the normal ap- 
petite the exception rather than the rule. Few children 
are taught, by parents, teachers, or preachers, the im- 
portance of restricting the appetite. The seeds of in- 
temperance sown by those who prepare food for the 
family table bring a larger harvest than does the work 
of all the devil's agencies in saloons and tobacco shops 
combined. Millions of dollars are worse than wasted by 
the conversion of food materials into strong drinks to 
satisfy appetites perverted by wrong habits of eating. 
Why are our schools and churches more interested in 
the maintenance of a worn-out, traditional educational 
system, and an abstract, impractical religion, than in some 
of these vital teachings? We look to legislation to cure 
degenerate appetites for which we are largely responsible 
through false education in home and school and church. 
Starving ones of earth are deprived of food when we 



Food Economy 11 

convert it into strong drink; the process requires the 
time and strength of a great army of workers ; and trans- 
portation facilities now used for carrying whisky, tobacco, 
and other body- and mind-destroying substances, might 
be used in transporting the foods we waste. It is esti- 
mated that we waste enough in our kitchens to feed ten 
million people. "Blessed art thou, land, when . . . thy 
princes eat in due season, for strength, and not for drunk- 
enness !" 

Some Economies 

Dr. Osier has said tha»t "pie north of the Mason and 
Dixon line, and hot bread south of it, have done more 
harm than alcohol." The best breads contain the whole 
grain ; they are well baked, require considerable chewing, 
resist the pressure of the teeth, and save dental bills. 
Thorough mastication neutralizes an abnormal appetite. 

Rich pastries, harmful condiments, tea and coffee, — 
narcotics recognized as extravagant, harmful, and use- 
less beverages, — are being discarded for the sake of both 
health and economy. Remove the cream and the sugar 
from tea and coffee, and they have no food value. 

Use the coffee mill to grind wheat, rye, and corn, 
that you may enjoy the vitamines, the mineral salts, and 
other elements often removed by the manufacturer. 

Many people prominent in social circles are eliminat- 
ing all lunches served between regular meals and eaten 
for merely social purposes. Such lunches impose a bur- 
den on the body and the purse. Wealthy and influential 
women are setting a good example by going to market 
in person, in order to make intelligent and economical 
purchases for their tables, and by carrying their supplies 
home, in order to save the added cost of the delivery sys- 
tem. People are beginning to realize that by such eco- 
nomical methods, they can serve their country, the world, 
and themselves. 



12 The Food Question 

Some have thought it necessary to eat from three to 
five meals a day. The war is helping them to appreciate 
a physiological truth taught for years by a few reform- 
ers, — that two meals a day are better even than three. 

Many countries, for economy's sake, now prohibit the 
use, for food, of young and undeveloped animals. They 
discourage the extensive use of immature plant foods. 
The world war is terrible, yet there is some compensa- 
tion in the fact that present conditions are making minds 
more susceptible to the principles of right living. For 
years, some earnest men and women have been teaching 
that God intended that man should live on a meatless 
diet. To-day, not only are nations asking that men eat 
less meat, but they are having their meatless days. Be- 
cause of the impossibility of securing flesh foods in some 
countries, millions of earth's inhabitants have learned 
that the body can be kept in splendid condition without 
the use of animal proteins and fats. No strong arguments 
are necessary to convince people that flesh foods are ex- 
pensive when it is known that ten pounds of grain suit- 
able for human food are required to produce in the animal 
one pound of flesh food. 

Meat Substitutes 

The high cost of flesh foods is turning attention to 
meat substitutes. Proteins and fats of the vegetable world 
are not only cheaper, but they are more wholesome than 
flesh. For example: The soy bean, recently introduced 
to the American table, contains, pound for pound, and at 
one fifth the cost, almost twice as much available protein 
and fat as the best beefsteak. Besides that, it offers the 
eater a good supply of starch. 

"We have got to learn to buy wisely, cook wisely, eat 
wisely, and waste nothing." The great countries of Eu- 
rope are utilizing the best talent of their statesmen and 



Fo«B Economy 13 

scientists in teaching the people these ideas. This should 
be a most impressive lesson to home, to church, and to 
school, since these agencies have so far forgotten their 
mission that it is necessary for this great war to arouse us. 

Let religious and educational leaders redeem the time. 
Let them cooperate with national economists who now are 
urging the people — 

To use more home-ground flour and meal. 

To use the natural rice with its vitamines instead of 
the polished product. 

To substitute vegetable oils for dairy butter in cooking. 

To have a simpler variety of food at each meal. 

To serve a dessert, when one is deemed necessary, for 
its food value and as a part of a balanced ration. 

To bake or boil potatoes in the skins, in order to pre- 
serve the mineral salts. 

To utilize for soups and gravies the water in which 
vegetables, macaroni, and rice are boiled. 

To serve only one food of high protein value at a meal. 

To feed to animals nothing that can be utilized by the 
human body. 

To allow vegetables, grains, and legumes to ripen, that 
their full food value may be obtained, and that the expense 
of canning may be avoided. 

To can or dry all fruits and vegetables that cannot be 
preserved in any other way. 

To substitute other cereals for wheat, which can be 
shipped abroad. 

A wheatless meal every day will drive many to ap- 
preciate the value of other grains, whose use heretofore 
has been largely perverted. Corn, rye, barley, and oats 
are not appreciated as they should be. They have been 
used largely in the manufacture of intoxicating drinks 
and for feeding animals to procure meat. It has been said 
that the Revolutionary War was won by men fed on hasty 



14 The Food Question 

pudding — in other words, corn meal mush. Learn to 
eat bread made from corn, rye, or oats, or a mixture of 
these grains. Form the habit of eating these more eco- 
nomical breads ; then continue the practice. Such breads 
are far superior to the ordinary denatured white bread. 
If a dog is fed only white bread, death will result sooner 
than if it is fed nothing. 

The Call of the Coiintry 

Land in Europe that for centuries was used to gratify 
the abnormal tastes of plutocrats and the aristocracy, is 
now being made to produce wholesome food to meet the 
world's needs. In America, people are still deprived of 
their divine right to a simple home, because millions of 
acres of land are held in a similar manner. 

Schools and churches should encourage the cultivation 
of vacant city lots. City people may thus learn the 
secret of intensive farming. It may give some courage 
to make a home on a few acres of land and to raise the 
food for their own tables. Every turn in a congested 
center calls for an outlay of means. Modern methods of 
living are unnatural and extravagant. In the city, every 
article of food costs in proportion to its distance from 
the base of supplies. Transportation must be added to 
the original cost of production ; the jobber, the wholesaler, 
the^ commission merchant, the retailer, the delivery man, 
and the baker must all have their profits. 

Get out of the cities; get onto the land! Why not 
preach this part of the gospel ? Help people to understand 
that the unnatural appetites and the desires for artificial 
food are penalties paid very largely by those who seek to 
maintain themselves by their wits. One ' mighty step 
has been taken toward the prevention of waste and in 
economy's favor when men learn to earn their bread in 
the sweat of their face while tilling the soil. 



Food Economy 15 

Late hours, business worry, nerve-wrecking noises, the 
hurry, the wear and tear of living in a crowd, the dust 
and filth of the city air, the struggle of competition, — 
these would be replaced by purer, saner surroundings 
if parents settled in some country place where children 
are born with a heritage of fresh air, grassy playgrounds, 
wholesome daily tasks in the house and out of doors, and 
are fed in a simple manner befitting their surroundings. 
But do not transfer the evils of the city to some country 
site. Not much need to urge "the gospel of the clean 
plate" to the healthy country child! A good appetite is 
the best seasoning for plain food. 

Permanent Reforms 

The world has been roughly awakened, and forcibly 
compelled to study food economy. This upheaval should 
result in permanent good to every individual. We have 
not fully appreciated the fact that our sinful indulgence 
and our careless waste of time, money, and food is a 
violation of the great commandment, "Thou shalt love 
thy neighbor as thyself." By our extravagant ways, 
multitudes have been robbed of the necessities of life. 
But our horizon is broadening. We begin to understand 
why we should eat and drink to the glory of God. Pro- 
vision is now being made for the bread we save to reach 
the hungry in distant parts of the earth. We can now 
prove that he who gives even a cup of cold water shall 
in no wise lose his reward. To-day, as truly as on the 
shores of Galilee, the great Master is saying, "Gather up 
the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost." And 
if we enter whole-heartedly into this food conservation 
movement, we may expect the blessing of the Lord to 
rest so greatly upon the fragments saved that the wide 
world will be fed.

FOOD ELEMENTS and 
SIMPLICITY of DIET 

by 

E. H. RISLEY, M.D. 

Chair of Chemistry, College of Medical Evangelists, 
Loma Linda, California 

"Food is any substance that, being taken into the body 
of animal or plant, serves, through organic action, to 
build up normal structure or supply waste of tissue." 

Food principles or elements are commonly grouped 
into the following classes: 

1. Proteins 

2. Fats 

3. Carbohydrates 
A brief discussion of these food elements will help 

our readers to select their food supply more intelligently. 



4. Inorganic salts 

5. Vitamines 

6. Water 



Proteins 

The first class of food substances mentioned above are 
of very great importance to the body. The term "protein" 
really means, "of first importance." These compounds 

(17) 

2 — Food Question 



18 The Food Question 

are represented by such foods as the white of egg, lean 
meat, gluten of wheat, and casein of milk. Chemically, 
proteins are very complex, more so than any other class 
of food materials. They have in their structure the chemi- 
cal elements carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, often 
sulphur and phosphorus, and, less commonly, iron. The 
nitrogenous element seems to be the most important, since 
the others mentioned can be obtained from other classes 
of food ; but as these classes of food cannot take the place 
of protein, it seems clear that the nitrogen is the impor- 
tant constituent. 

Most proteins coagulate on heating. An illustration 
of this property is the coagulation of the white of an egg 
when the egg is cooked. The proteins all undergo decom- 
position quite easily. This is evidenced by the ease with 
v/hich eggs and meat spoil. 

Protein molecules are made up of smaller molecules 
called amino acids. These are the "building stones" from 
which the working tissues of the body are formed. There 
are on the average about fifteen different kinds of these 
amino acids in the proteins, which are especially valu- 
able in supplying building material for the tissues of 
the human body. These amino acids are united in long 
chains to form the protein molecule, and in this respect 
can be compared to cars in a train. By the work of 
digestion, the proteins are broken down into these com- 
paratively simple building stones, which, when absorbed 
into the circulation, are used by the body in building 
working tissues as they are needed. 

There are a number of classes of proteins ; but since 
the classification is rather complicated, it will not be given 
here. To group the various foods as to their relative 
amounts of protein is often of interest. For example, 
foods very rich in protein, such as the gluten prepara- 
tions, lean beef, and white of egg, may be regarded as 



Food Elements and Simplicity of Diet 19 

the first class; a second class might be formed of those 
which are moderately high in protein, such as peas, beans, 
lentils, and walnuts; a third class having a moderate 
amount of protein, represented by the cereals and breads ; 
and still a fourth class very low in protein, such as vege- 
tables and fruits. 

Protein is the tissue builder of the body; but the 
actual amount of tissue built new each day is very small, 
therefore the need for a large supply of protein for this 
purpose is not apparent. Protein not only supplies tissue- 
building material, but it can also supply heat and energy 
in a manner similar to the other classes of food elements, 
carbohydrate and fat, one ounce of the protein yielding 
one hundred sixteen calories of energy. The excess taken 
in may be used in this way, as there is no storage of this 
material in the body. However, to use this kind of fuel 
takes more work on the part of the body as a whole, as the 
nitrogenous wastes must be eliminated by the kidneys. 

One can see, then, that a certain amount of protein is 
needed to keep the tissues in good repair, but that it is 
better to get most of the heat and energy from the food 
elements specially designed for that purpose ; that is, car- 
bohydrate and fat. 

The Chittenden standard of diet gives ten per cent of 
the total fuel value in the form of protein. On the basis 
of two thousand five hundred total calories a day, two 
hundred fifty calories of protein would be required. This 
is equal to two and one seventh ounces actual dry protein. 
This amount is thought by some to be low, but experi- 
mental evidence seems clearly to prove its adequacy in 
keeping up nutrition. 

Fats 

The second group of food elements in our classification 
are substances having a greasy feeling and taste. They 



20 The Food Question 

are lighter than water, leave a grease spot upon paper, 
are insoluble in water, and soluble in such chemicals as 
gasoline and ether. 

Fats have in their molecules the chemical elements 
carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. These elements are put 
together into two groups, or compounds, glycerin and fatty 
acids, which, when chemically united, form a fat. When 
fats are exposed to the open air, and thus contaminated 
with bacteria, they are likely to become rancid; that is, 
some of the glycerin and fatty acids are set free from 
each other. If butter is the fat so decomposed, it becomes 
very disagreeable, on account of the volatile butyric acid 
that is set free. 

Fatty bodies are usually grouped under a general 
heading called lipins, but the consideration of the other 
classes is not essential in this study. 

The vegetable kingdom offers a large list of products 
containing fats, many of which are suitable for food. 
Following are a few examples, with the percentage of fat 
in each case : coconuts, sixty-eight per cent ; olives, fifty- 
six per cent; peanuts, forty-one per cent; cotton seed, 
twenty per cent ; oatmeal, six per cent ; corn, four per cent. 

The animal kingdom is also rich in fat products, illus- 
trated by the following substances used as foods : butter, 
eighty-five per cent; bacon, sixty-five per cent; cheese, 
thirty per cent; eggs, eleven per cent; cow's milk, four 
per cent. 

The function of fat in the body is to yield heat and 
energy primarily. Each ounce of fat yields two hundred 
sixty-four calories of heat, making the group two and one 
fourth times as active as either protein or carbohydrate 
in this respect. 

Fats ordinarily supply from twenty-five to thirty per 
cent of the total calories of a well balanced dietary. On 
the basis of two thousand five hundred total calories a 



Food Elements and Simplicity of Diet 21 

day, about seven hundred fifty should be fat. At two 
hundred sixty-four calories to an ounce, we have about 
three ounces as our daily need of this food element. 

Fats are also stored in the body as a reserve of energy. 
Every one has more or less of this sort of reserve, unless 
he has been starving for some time, or is suffering from 
a wasting disease. This reserve of fat also acts as a pro- 
tection, and gives shape and symmetry to the body. 

Recently methods have been devised for changing the 
unstable vegetable oils into stable, lardlike, solid fats. 
This process is called hydrogenation, so named because 
the process is really one of adding hydrogen until the fat 
becomes saturated and less likely to undergo decomposi- 
tion into fatty acid and glycerin. The fats thus formed 
seem to be equal to the animal fats so far as digestion 
and utilization are concerned, and hence are of consider- 
able economic value at the present time. 

Certain fats, including those of butter and milk, are 
rich in the so-called vitamines, and have been shown, by 
recent experiments upon animals, to be efficient growth 
stimulants. 

Carbohydrates 

The carbohydrates are made up of the chemical ele- 
ments carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. By noticing the 
name, one readily sees that the first part stands for the 
carbon. The latter half, "hydrate," indicates that water 
might be present ; and in fact, nearly all of these bodies 
have hydrogen and oxygen present in the proportion to 
form water, that is, two parts hydrogen to one of oxygen. 
Carbohydrates ordinarily make up about sixty to sixty-five 
per cent of the total number of calories of our diet. Most 
carbohydrates, when pure, are either white powders or 
white crystalline solids. Many of them are sweet to the 
taste. The starches and the celluloses are not soluble in 
cold water, but the sugars are readily soluble. 



22 The Food Question 

The classification of the carbohydrates is compara- 
tively simple ; and part of it is given here, as it will help 
in our discussion of the properties of the group :

Cellulose is the coarse woody fiber found in the stems 
of all plants and in the outer coating of the various grains. 
Unless cellulose is very young and tender, it is not digested 
by the human digestive system. However, some forms of 
it are of value, as thej^ give bulk to the food residue in 
the digestive tract, and thus stimulate the activity of the 
intestinal muscle. In this way, cellulose acts as a natural 
laxative, and in some cases is a very desirable substance 
to have in the food eaten. The bran of wheat and other 
cereals is an especially valuable form to use. 

Starch is found in all cereals, in many vegetables, in 
some fruits, and in nuts. It occurs in these different 
foods in the form of a white, granular substance. The 
granules have characteristic forms for the different grains, 
fruits, etc., which can be recognized by the aid of the 
microscope. Raw starch is insoluble in cold water ; hence 
to be most readily digested, it should be cooked. The 
cooking process ruptures the granules, and makes the 
starch itself partially soluble; and in this form, it is 
more easily attacked by the digestive juices. 

Dextrin is formed by heating starch to about 350° F., 
as in an oven. This degree of heat changes the starch 
chemically to dextrin. In this dextrin form, it is soluble, 
and is in reality one step along in the process of digestion.

28 The Food Question 

Thoroughly toasted bread is quite well dextrinized. It 
is more easily digested, has a sweeter taste than ordinary 
bread, and in some cases, is more desirable. 

Sugar Group 

Cane sugar is probably the most important member 
of the sugar groups. It is obtained from the sugar cane 
and the sugar beet, the two forms being identical chemi- 
cally. It can be obtained in a high state of purity, often 
up to ninety-nine and eight tenths per cent. The English- 
speaking races use the largest amount of this sugar, in 
some countries averaging as high as eighty-five pounds 
per capita a year. Cane sugar is white, crystalline, solu- 
ble in water, and has a very sweet taste. 

Malt sugar is obtained from grains, such as barley or 
wheat, by allowing them to sprout. During the sprouting 
process, there is developed in the grain a ferment that is 
capable of changing starch to malt sugar. After the malt 
diastase, as the ferment is called, has had a chance to 
convert the starch to malt sugar, the sugar is extracted 
with water, and the resulting solution evaporated to a 
sirup. This sirup can be evaporated further and the malt 
sugar or maltose taken out as a solid; but it is usually 
used in the form of a sirup. This maltose is a natural 
product to the body, as it is formed by the saliva and the 
pancreatic juice when they act upon starch. 

Milk stigar is found to the extent of about five per 
cent in cow's milk. It is obtained as a by-product in 
the manufacture of cheese. The whey, or watery fluid 
left after the removal of the curd, is evaporated and 
purified until a fine, white, rather gritty powder, or in 
some cases a crystalline solid, is obtained. This milk 
sugar, or lactose, is soluble in water, and has a fairly 
sweet taste. Lactose is one of the essential food elements 
for the normal growth of a child or a young animal. 



Food Elements and Simplicity of Diet 29 

Hence one can see why children cannot be reared easily 
without milk. 

Glucose is the most important sugar in the third 
group of carbohydrates as given above. It is found natu- 
rally in many fruits, and is here called grape sugar. It 
is the normal sugar of human blood, and in this con- 
nection, is usually called dextrose. Glucose is made com- 
mercially by boiling starch, most frequently cornstarch, 
in water, to which sulphuric acid has been added up to 
one to one and one half per cent. After sufficient boiling, 
the acid is neutralized with lime, and the sugar sepa- 
rated by chemical methods. If the process is carried out 
carefully, and reasonably pure reagents are used in the 
process, the result will be a sirup of fair purity and one 
of value as a food. Impure and poorly made samples of 
glucose have given this otherwise wholesome sugar a 
bad name. 

Glucose can also be obtained in solid form by con- 
tinuing the process of purification a few steps beyond the 
sirup stage. But let it not be forgotten that any of the 
sugars, taken in large amounts, may overload the diges- 
tive system and the liver, and hence they should be used 
in reasonable amounts. 

Levulose, called also fruit sugar, is found in some of 
the sweet fruits and in bees' honey. The chief sugar of 
honey is called invert sugar, and is really made up of 
equal parts of dextrose and levulose. It is present up 
to seventy-five per cent in- good samples of honey. These 
sugars, properly used, are excellent foods. 

Importance of Carbohydrates 

The carbohydrates are our chief source of heat and 
energy, and as previously stated, furnish sixty to sixty- 
five per cent of the total fuel value of our food. Each 
ounce of pure carbohydrate yields one hundred sixteen 



30 The Food Question 

calories of heat when burned. In caloric yield, they are 
equal to the proteins gram for gram, but yield less than 
one half that of the fats. If two thousand five hundred 
calories are again taken as our standard, then sixty per 
cent would make one thousand five hundred calories to 
be furnished by the carbohydrates. At one hundred 
sixteen calories an ounce, we find that it would require 
thirteen ounces of pure carbohydrate a day to balance 
this part of our diet. 

Other Essential Elements 

The inorganic salts or ash of food are just as essential 
to the body as the other groups of food elements. These 
essential salts consist of the most common chemical ele- 
ments, such as soda, potash, lime, magnesia, iron, phos- 
phorus, sulphur, etc. One might expect to find some rare 
elements in a piece of mechanism as complicated as the 
human body, but such is not the case. The body salts 
are of the most common kinds. These salts are found 
in proper amounts in foods as produced by nature. We 
cannot take these salts as they are found in the chemical 
laboratory and use them to good advantage, but we should 
make sure that we are taking foods that will supply them 
in the proper amounts. Our best sources of supply are 
the grains, the fruits, and the vegetables. It is interest- 
ing to note that these mineral elements are generally 
found most abundantly, in the grains at least, in or near 
the outer coating, and that our high-grade flours are 
partially robbed of them when the bran and the middlings 
are removed. The same seems to be true of potatoes. 
In peeling, a large part of these salts is removed, and 
thus the real value of this splendid food product is less- 
ened. This is one of the strong arguments for the use 
of whole wheat flours and other whole grain products. 
These inorganic salts are needed in the body to keep the 



Food Elements and Simplicity of Diet 31 

various tissues up to their normal in composition. For 
example, the blood constantly needs some iron to build 
the red cells. Though the actual amount needed is very 
small, yet that small amount is exceedingly important 
to have at hand. 

As some of these salts are constantly being eliminated 
from the body, there must be a constant supply to keep 
the tissues in equilibrium. 

Vitamines 

Vitamines are elsewhere considered in this booklet, 
hence only a very brief summary here. The chemistry 
of these products is very little understood at present. 
They were so named by Funk because of their nitrogen 
content and similarity to ammonia, the name really mean- 
ing vital ammonias. The term "vital" carries with it the 
idea of their importance to life. Some persons have 
questioned this name; but up to the present, it seems 
to be the best suggested. 

The importance of the vitamines in nutrition has been 
very clearly demonstrated in experiments upon animals, 
and these experiments have been repeated a sufficient 
number of times to be conclusive. Animals have been 
fed upon pure protein, fat, carbohydrate, and salts, but 
with vitamine removed or destroyed; and although re- 
ceiving calories enough, they fail to keep up their nutri- 
tion. With a simple change of dietary to include a small 
amount of food containing the vitamine, without any 
change in the total calories eaten, their nutrition im- 
proves quickly, and they come back to a normal state. 

Foods rich in vitamine are represented by milk, fresh 
vegetables, fresh fruits, and whole grain products. Foods 
poor in these substances are represented by sterilized 
and preserved milks, dried fruits, dried vegetables, white 
flour, and polished rice. 



32 The Food Question 

Vitamines are reduced or lost by the following proc- 
esses in the preparation of foods : taking off the coating 
of grain, overheating, washing out in cooking, and drying. 

Importance of Water 

Water, although not a food in the sense of yielding 
fuel value to the body, is a most important agent in 
all the various chemical processes taking place in the 
tissues. 

Water is the universal solvent; and because of this 
property, it carries both food and waste to and from 
the tissues. The average person needs from three to 
five quarts a day, a part of which is taken as a portion 
of the food eaten. This leaves from three to five pints 
to be taken as a drink. Good drinking water should be 
colorless, odorless, and of an agreeable taste; should be 
free from organic matter, poisonous metals, and the bac- 
teria of disease ; and should be low in nonpoisonous min- 
eral salts — that is, should be reasonably soft. 

There are three common classes of water that are 
used for drinking purposes ; namely, rain water, surface 
water, and ground water. Rain water is the purest if 
properly collected. Surface water — water from lakes, 
streams, etc. — is most likely to be contaminated with 
organic matter and bacteria. Ground water — that is, 
water from springs and wells — is likely to be the hard- 
est, but is usually free from bacteria of disease unless 
there is some contamination from the surface. To take a 
fairly good quantity of water between meals is better 
than to drink too freely at the meal hour. 

Great care should be taken in selecting the supply of 
drinking water, as when contaminated, it is a very fruit- 
ful means for the transmission of diseases, particularly 
such diseases as typhoid fever. If not certain of the 
purity of a water supply, one can be sure to destroy all 



Food Elements and Simplicity of Diet 33 

the disease-producing bacteria by boiling the water for 
a few minutes, then cooling, and drinking as usual. 

Simple Dietetic Principles 

1. Food should be pleasant to the sight and the taste. 

2. Eat slowly. Masticate thoroughly. 

3. Do not wash down your food with water or any kind 
of beverage. 

4. Cheerfulness is an important aid to digestion. The 
mind should be free from care, and the surroundings 
pleasant. 

5. Avoid overeating. 

6. There should be between five and six hours' interval 
between meals, and no food should be taken during this 
interval. 

7. Make your list of foods balance up with about ten 
per cent protein, twenty-five to thirty per cent fat, and 
sixty to sixty-five per cent carbohydrate. 

8. Eat few kinds of food at a meal, but vary the menu 
from day to day. 

9. Food should be properly cooked to get the best re- 
sults. 

10. Do not eat late at night. The evening meal should 
be the lightest. 

11. Eat green vegetables frequently in season. 

12. Fresh fruits are very helpful in the diet. 

13. Combine fruits, grains, and nuts. 

14. Fruits and coarse vegetables are not a good com- 
bination. 

15. It is better not to take large quantities of cane sugar 
and milk together. 

16. Do not eat rich and complicated mixtures of food. 

17. Flesh meats are expensive, they make the protein 
high, and are second-hand foods. Their place may easily 
be supplied by other foods. 

3 — Food Question 



34 The Food Question 

18. Avoid excessive amounts of salt. 

19. Do not use pepper or other irritating condiments 
and spices in seasoning your food. 

20. Tea and coffee are not foods, and should be entirely- 
dispensed with, 

21. Alcohol is a poison, and should be entirely eliminated 
from the menu. 




Necessary Knowledge to 
Careful Planning 

To thousands of home-keepers the requirements 
are new: a correct knowledge of proteids, of 
carbohydrates, of calories is unfamiliar to them. 
They cannot grasp what is asked of them, in a day 
or a week or a month. Suddenly has housekeeping 
been transformed from a daily round to a science and 
a business. ... It all calls for intelligent study and 
the most careful planning. It is not a small "bit," it 
is a full-sized job: never has the American woman 
faced a bigger job. As she does it or fails of doing it, 
will this great country win or lose the war. — Ladies' 
Home Jouryial.

VITAMINES ^/^^ CALORIES 

by 

D. D, COMSTOCK,M.D. 

for years Medical Superintendent of Glendale 
Sanitarium, Glendale, California 



The body is a machine, intricate, complicated, "fear- 
fully and wonderfully" constructed. In one way, it is 
simple in its operations ; but in another, so ultrascientific 
in the detail of its automatic control, and so deep in the 
mysteries of its chemical processes, that the investigation 
of ages has not been able to fathom its greater scientific 
depths, and bring to the surface a knowledge of its ulti- 
mate structure and its wonderful workings. The Master 
Designer of the living machine so adjusted its mechanism 
that in its original environment and relationship, its care 
would be easy, and the laws of its preservation few and 
exceedingly simple. 

Like most machines, the human machine requires the 
impartation of energy. Similarly, also, this is supplied by 
the combustion of certain carbonaceous substances. It 
needs constant repair. These and its other needs are all 
furnished in the daily food supply. 

(35) 



36 The Food Question 

The life of this machine can be greatly lengthened by 
intelligent care, or shortened by neglect and abuse. Its 
efficiency may be similarly affected. While one cannot 
hear the pounding of the engine or the rattling of the 
machinery, yet the machine is damaged if run under too 
high a pressure and at too great speed. 

There are seven classes of the essential elemental food 
substances, — proteins, fats, carbohydrates, vitamines, 
salts, cellulose, and water. The ideal diet is one in which 
these seven elements are regularly supplied to the body in 
the amounts required to meet its daily needs. A person 
living close to nature, receiving his food first-handed, di- 
rect from nature's health food factory, and eating it with 
only the cooking and seasoning necessary, and with a 
reasonable variety, would probably find his diet sufficient, 
and the elements in about the proper proportions; and 
with an honest appetite, steadied by a little temperate-in- 
all-things ballast, he probably would not go far astray as 
to the proper amounts. But unfortunately, the average 
individual is not living close to nature. Much that is 
artificial has come in. Our appetites are capricious, de- 
ceitful, and unreasonable. Our foods come to us proc- 
essed, cartonned, and tinned, often embalmed, devital- 
ized, or adulterated. They are often served to us so 
disguised that we cannot tell whether their nutritive sub- 
stance has been concentrated or diluted, or indeed whether 
or not the body will recognize it as having any nutritive 
value at all, despite its pleasing flavor. Therefore, in 
order that the ideal may be approximated to a reasonable 
and practical degree, we must have some knowledge not 
only of the needs of the body, but also of these food 
elements, and how their values may be estimated in the 
various food substances. 

The foods that enter into the make-up of the body and 
supply its heat and energy are three, — protein, fat, and 



VlTAMINES AND CALORIES 37 

carbohydrate. While the salts to a certain extent enter 
into the body structure, they have but little to do with 
heat and energy production. The remaining food classes 
are adjuncts, their use being simply to make possible the 
utilization, by the body, of the tissue and fuel foods. The 
cellulose assists mechanically in digestion ; the water fur- 
nishes the necessary fluid ; and the vitamines provide the 
battery, as it were, which sets the whole apparatus in 
motion. 

The Heat Unit 

Of the many persons who, for economical or hygienic 
reasons, have tried to adjust their diet better, some have 
undertaken the task without a fundamental knowledge 
of the physiological and caloric value of foods, their com- 
position, or the nutritional needs of the body, and have 
done themselves more harm than good. It is possible for 
us to measure the value of our foods, and to express it in 
terms of heat units ; and with a knowledge of the bodily 
needs, we may supply ourselves with foods in approxi- 
mately the amounts needed, and in the best combinations. 
Food oxidized in the body produces the same amount of 
heat as that burned outside the body, and the instrument 
by which the heat value of any substance is determined is 
called a calorimeter. The unit of measure of heat is called 
the calorie or heat unit. 

The calorimeter consists of a double chamber, the 
outer one containing a given quantity of water. The inner 
chamber is thus surrounded by a water jacket. In it is 
placed a definite amount of pure, water-free food to be 
tested ; for example, an ounce of sugar. By means of an 
electric connection, the sugar is ignited and burned, and 
the heat produced thereby is imparted to the water in the 
outer chamber. When the process is complete, the dif- 
ference in the temperature of the water is noted, and the 



38 The Food Question 

amount of heat generated is computed. The calorie is 
the amount of heat necessary to raise the temperature of 
one pound of water four degrees F., or one kilogram one 
degree C. In this way, the heat values of pure protein, 
fat, starch, and sugar have been determined. In the 
laboratories of the United States government, the compo- 
sition and caloric value of practically every food substance 
known has been worked out. Any person can have access 
to these tables of food values by applying to the govern- 
ment, or by purchasing from almost any bookstore any 
one of the several books on food values, that are on the 
market. (See pages 23-27 of this book.) 

The heat value of a gram of pure, water-free protein 
— for example, the casein of milk, egg albumen, or fiber 
of meat — is a trifle more than four calories. That of 
pure starch or sugar is also four calories. Fat is more 
than double this value, one gram yielding nine and three 
tenths calories. Since an ounce equals about thirty grams, 
the number of calories to an ounce is determined by mul- 
tiplying the above figures by thirty. Different kinds of 
food vary greatly in the proportion of the food elements 
and also of the water and cellulose they contain. (Cel- 
lulose has no fuel value in the human body.) We there- 
fore find a great variation as to their caloric values also. 
For example, one heaping tablespoonful of home-baked 
beans will weigh about fifty grams, thirty of which is 
water and cellulose. Its total caloric value is one hundred, 
divided among protein fifteen, fat forty (the fat has 
largely been added), and carbohydrate fortj^-five. Con- 
trast with this the same quantity of mashed turnips. One 
heaping tablespoonful will weigh about seventy grams, 
of which sixty-five is water and cellulose. Its total fuel 
value is three calories. 

By a little study, one may very readily become familiar 
with the approximate values of the more common foods, 



VlTAMINES AND CALORIES 39 

and be able to arrive at some conclusion in regard to the 
correctness of one's daily food ration as to amount and 
proportions. Many would be surprised to see how far 
short their diet comes of the ideal. 

It is easy to remember that an ordinary slice of bread 
— about three and one half inches square — contains ap- 
proximately one hundred calories ; an average egg, sixty- 
five ; a glass of milk, one hundred fifty ; an average potato, 
one hundred twenty-five ; a tablespoonf ul of gravity cream, 
fifty; the usual serving of cooked cereal, seventy-five to 
one hundred; vegetables, except potatoes, an ordinary 
serving, twenty-five to fifty, depending on the amount of 
fat or milk added as seasoning ; legumes, average serving, 
one hundred to one hundred fifty. Desserts are usually 
high in value, ranging from one hundred twenty-five 
calories in the usual serving of simple custard or junket 
to three hundred fifty or more in the usual one sixth of 
some pies, or the ordinary piece of cake. 

Housewives who wish to go into the question of foods 
thoroughly, and combine the science with the art of cook- 
ery, may arrange a table of the staples and raw food that 
ordinarily enter into their various recipes, somewhat 
after the following, the items of which have been taken 
at random from such a list or table already prepared 
and in use :

If the housewife desires to know the food value of a 
cake, for instance, that she is about to bake, whose recipe 
calls for two cups flour, one and one half cups sugar, one 
half cup butter, four eggs, she can very easily find out by 
consulting her table; as:

If the cake is cut into twelve servings, the value of 
each may be determined by dividing each of these sums 
by twelve. Thus each piece will represent in value, pro- 
tein, twenty-one calories; fat, ninety calories; carbohy- 
drate, one hundred seventy-five calories; total, two hun- 
dred eighty-six calories. 

The number of calories needed by the individual varies 
with height, age, sex, climate, and state of muscular ac- 
tivity ; but for the average person, two thousand calories 
daily may be taken as a working basis. If one is engaged 
in active muscular labor, the requirement may be three 
thousand or more. Many persons of sedentary habits do 
better on less than two thousand. Other things being 
equal, men need about ten per cent more than women. 
Children need about ten per cent more than adults. An 
obese individual, or one suffering from the results of im- 
perfect oxidation, as manifested in rheumatism, neuralgia, 
and myalgia, may do well for a time on as low an allow- 
ance as one thousand one hundred to one thousand two 
hundred food units daily, experiencing marked relief from 
symptoms, and if obese, a reduction in weight of from 
one to four pounds a week. 

It should be kept in mind that the amount of protein 
needed is quite constant, and does not vary with one's 
state of activity, as does the demand for the fats and the 
carbohydrates. From two hundred to two hundred fifty 
calories of this element are needed daily, even though the 
total ration be low. If one does well on the low ration 
suggested above, the protein should not be lowered pro- 
portionately, as would be the tendency. This is the repair 



VlTAMINES AND CALORIES 41 

substance, which the body, not being able to store up, 
must have supplied to it in regular daily amounts. 

Excess in eating is often due to the use of certain 
concentrated foods. A teaspoonful of olive oil contains 
forty calories; the ordinary pat of butter (one fourth 
ounce), fifty calories; a heaping teaspoonful of sugar, 
forty calories ; one English walnut, thirty-three calories ; 
a fair sized olive, twenty calories. While these are good 
foods, they should be eaten with due regard for their 
high energy value, that the proper food balance be not 
disturbed. After eating a good square meal, the average 
individual calls for the dessert, which, with its accom- 
paniments, actually constitutes a second meal; as, for 
example, a serving of pie, three hundred fifty calories; 
its cheese accompaniment, another one hundred calories; 
a few stuffed dates, another one hundred calories ; a few 
nuts and raisins and a cup of chocolate bringing the total 
value of this second meal forced upon the body up to 
seven hundred or eight hundred calories. 

Vegetables of themselves are low in caloric value, their 
importance being due to the cellulose, salts, and vitamines 
they contain. But they are usually prepared with so much 
butter or cream that as served they have a high caloric 
value in fat. Lean meat is practically pure protein, and 
the tendency of the meat eater is to get an excess of this 
element. The vegetarian often goes to the other extreme, 
his diet showing a deficiency in protein, with an excess of 
fats and carbohydrates. That the protein balance be kept 
normal is an important matter, for a person may at one 
and the same time be suffering from the results of a de- 
ficient diet and also from the effects of overeating. The 
protein needed daily is from ten to thirteen per cent of 
the total ration. If the total daily ration is but one thou- 
sand five hundred calories, the protein should still be two 
hundred calories, and therefore thirteen per cent of the 



42 The Food Question 

total. Thus if a person is living on foods containing less 
than ten per cent, there is danger of not getting enough 
of this important element. Much of the food eaten is less 
than ten per cent protein, because of the addition to it of 
fat and sugar in large amounts. 

So-called meat substitutes should be high in the per- 
centage of protein, in order to make up for the butter, 
sugar, oils, olives, desserts, fruits, and other very low pro- 
tein foods that enter so largely into one's dietary. The 
question has been asked, Why object to the addition of fat 
to a meat substance, since it does not actually reduce the 
quantity of protein, though it does relatively? In reply, 
it may be said that the relative reduction makes necessary 
an excess of the nonnitrogenous foods, to get enough 
protein ; and even though one's capacity should receive it 
comfortably, still the objection to the excess aliment re- 
mains. 

A study of food composition and values will enable the 
housewife so to plan her meals that the various elements 
may be served to her family in the proper proportions. 
A knowledge of calories, and an intelligent application of 
the principles involved in these questions of nutrition, will 
enable any housewife to reduce the cost of feeding her 
family from twenty-five to fifty per cent, which would 
be worth while from an economical standpoint, not to 
mention the advantage to be realized healthwise. 

Vitamines 

Says Lusk, "It has thus far been shown that nutrition 
means fuel for the machinery, new parts with which to 
repair the machine, and minute quantities of vitamines, 
which produce a harmonious interaction between the ma- 
terials in the food and their host." 

In the words of another investigator, "The study of 
dietetics from the standpoint of the vitamines has only 



VlTAMINES AND CALORIES 43 

just begun." Sufficient has been learned and demon- 
strated about them, however, to show that they play a 
most important part in nutrition and in vital tissue proc- 
esses. Since they are so little understood, a complete 
definition is not yet possible. The pure vitamine, it seems, 
cannot be isolated, so their exact chemical nature is not 
known. The chemical process necessary to free it is no 
sooner begun than the vitamine is apparently decomposed, 
and all trace of it is lost. One is reminded of the efforts 
of some early investigators to submit living protoplasm 
to a chemical analysis, they hoping thereby to reveal the 
mysteries of physical life itself ; but at the first intrusion, 
this subtle something flees, taking its secrets with it, and 
leaving us only the empty shell of dead protein matter. 
While the activities and manifestations of life are seen on 
every hand in animal and plant, we are but little the 
wiser as to what life really is. 

Vitamines seem to stand closely related to the living 
process in the tissue cells. Some investigators have 
thought them to be the mother substances of the various 
bodily ferments and internal secretions, any disturbance 
of which produces serious constitutional troubles. There- 
fore the continuous use of a diet lacking in any of these 
mother substances would of necessity lead to a deficiency 
of these absolutely essential vital secretions and ferments. 

Vitamines and Disease 

Years were spent in investigation before it was found 
out that beriberi, a disease of the Orient, could be cured 
and prevented by the addition, to the diet, of certain nu- 
tritive elements in the covering of the rice, that are 
ordinarily removed in the polishing process, and thrown 
away. Just what these nutritive elements were, was not 
understood ; but the fact remained that a diet of polished 
rice resulted in symptoms of beriberi, while a diet of the 



44 The Food Question 

unpolished grain was sufficient to prevent any manifesta- 
tions of the disease. In Java, where the people lived 
largely on whole rice, beriberi was unknown. For years, 
the fact had been recognized, that sailors living on canned 
and preserved foods sooner or later developed scurvy, 
which could be quickly cured by an addition of fresh vege- 
tables or the juice of fruits, especially lemons and oranges, 
to the diet. In 1535, when all but three of Cartier's one 
hundred ten sailors had scurvy, he cured them all by giv- 
ing them a decoction of fresh pine needles. Babies fed on 
Pasteurized milk often develop infantile scurvy. 

Convincing Experiments 

Vitamines are made only in nature's laboratory. The 
body cannot make them, therefore mother's milk is de- 
ficient in vitamine if her diet is. This is demonstrated 
in a decided way in the Philippine Islands, where the 
diet is deficient in the vitamine preventing beriberi. 
Among the Filipinos, one half the deaths take place be- 
fore the end of the first year of age ; and in these infants, 
one half the deaths are due to beriberi. Pellagra, a dis- 
ease of obscure aetiology, or cause, manifests itself prin- 
cipally among a class of people who live on a monotonous 
diet of corn bread, bacon, soda biscuit, and sirup. Some 
authorities are quite convinced that it is a "deficiency" 
disease. Also rickets, eczema, pyorrhea, and a number of 
other diseases of obscure cause are beginning to be re- 
garded as being, in part at least, deficiency diseases. A 
predisposition to tuberculosis and other infections may be 
of similar cause. There are probably a number, possibly 
many, of these vitamine substances. At least two have 
been quite fully demonstrated, — the one preventing 
scurvy, and the one preventing beriberi. 

The experiments of Cosimir Funk, a Russian, are 
convincing. He was able to produce experimental beri- 



VlTAMINES AND CALORIES 45 

beri in pigeons by feeding them for three weeks on 
polished rice, then readily to cure them of the disease by 
feeding the polishings from the same rice, showing that 
in the rice polishings are certain elements absolutely es- 
sential to life. He finally isolated what appeared to be 
this substance, one pound of the polishings yielding about 
three grains of the material. Injecting under the skin of 
pigeons dying of beriberi one third of a grain of this 
crystalline substance, he was able not only to make them 
perfectly well in a few hours, but to keep them in health 
for three weeks with but the one dose, even though they 
were continued on a diet of polished rice. Funk named 
this wonderful life-giving substance vitamine, because its 
effects were life-giving, and chemically it seemed to belong 
to the amines. 

Where Founa 

Vitamines are found in plants, and especially in their 
seeds. Fresh meat and raw milk contain them, although 
animals seem incapable of making them. In summer, 
milk is richer in them than in winter, because of the 
difference in feed for the cattle. They are contained also 
in yolks of eggs, whole grains, potatoes, carrots, beans, 
peas, lentils — in fact, practically all green garden vege- 
tables, and fruit. In the grains, they are found in the 
dark layer near the outer surface or branny layer, and 
in the germ. In potatoes and other vegetables, they lie 
immediately under the skin. Yeast bread contains more 
than baking powder breads. 

Vitamines are lost by the processing of grains; that 
is, by the removal of the outer layers, which contain most 
of these substances. Hence the whole grain should be 
included in the flour. They are also destroyed by the 
subjection of foods to too high a temperature. It is there- 
fore best to cook cereals at a low temperature, as in a 



46 The Food Question 

fireless cooker. The vitamines are sacrificed in the drying 
of foods, and in the paring of vegetables. If potatoes are 
boiled, there is great advantage in boiling them in their 
"jackets," in which case the vitamines and the salts are 
not lost. If they are pared before they are boiled, the 
potato water should not be thrown away, as it is rich in 
vitamines, salts, and protein. Parboiling of other vege- 
tables is objectionable for the same reason. Soda and 
baking powder and similar chemicals seem to destroy the 
vitamines. This is one reason why yeast breads are better 
than baking powder breads. Furthermore, in yeast fer- 
mentation, the vitamine preventing beriberi is actually 
formed, but not the vitamine preventing scurvy. The 
natural foods that require cooking to make them edible 
and wholesome contain vitamines which are not destroyed 
thereby if the cooking is done in the most wholesome and 
hygienic way. 



A Word of Advice 
to Women 

STAY at home and work. Do not rush 
into some romantic and picturesque 
bit of action to the detriment of your 
home duties. Work in your homes, and 
do whatever you can outside ; the humbler 
and more inconspicuous your accomplish- 
ment is, the more it may be needed. 
There are enough women who will snaich 
at what is accompanied by the limelight. 
Make your contribution of personal serv- 
ice without thought of self, and keep on 
to the end. — Lord Northcliffe.

FRUITS AND THEIR 
DIETETIC VALUE 

h 
GEORGE A. THOMASON, M. D., L. R. C. S., L. R. C. P. 

No other class of foods more delightfully or deliciously 
contribute to the needs of the body than fruit. Fresh 
from the lap of Nature, lavishly supplied, and delightful 
to the eye, fruit makes most satisfying appeal to the 
appetite of every one, from the quite indifferent to the 
most discriminating epicure. Most easy of digestion, in 
fact, practically predigested, fruit is most appropriate 
for all people both in sickness and in health, and at all 
periods of life, from babyhood to extreme age. 

Fruit is made up of water, sugar, acids, some proteid, 
and organic salts. Water is by far the largest constituent 
of fruit, being seventy-five to eighty-five per cent. The 
water of fruit is of the greatest possible purity, being 
doubly distilled, first as rain, then as sap, drawn and 
filtered through the tree. 

The sugar of fruit is one of the most easily digested 
forms, that of levulose. The starch of the unripe fruit 

(47) 



48 The Food Question 

is converted into sugar in the ripening process, or in the 
cooking of partially ripened fruit. Sugar is present in 
varying amounts in fruits, averaging from five to ten 
per cent. A well ripened banana contains twenty-one 
per cent of sugar, dates about fifty per cent, while grapes 
contain from fourteen to twenty per cent. 

The outward appearance of the fruit is often a fairly 
reliable indication of the amount of sugar. Trielle has 
observed that fruits with yellow skins contain much 
sugar, and have a very penetrating odor. Fruits with 
red skins contain a medium amount of sugar, and have a 
pleasant, delicate perfume. Fruits with a reddish brown 
skin usually contain much sugar, and have very little 
perfume. 

As showing its perfectly digested state, demonstra- 
tions have proved that fruit sugar may be injected di- 
rectly into the blood, from which it will be utilized in 
nourishing the body. This is in marked contrast with 
ordinary cane sugar, which, if injected directly into the 
blood, is expelled through the kidneys, the body being 
unable to appropriate it as such from the blood. 

Fruit sugar may be eaten in practically unlimited 
quantities. It supplies the body with heat and energy 
in the most available form. For this reason, fruit when 
eaten will quickly relieve the sense of exhaustion. 

Fruit Acids 

The acids of fruits give to them their delightful and 
appetizing flavors. Fruits in the unripe state contain 
tannic acid, a marked astringent. The gastric and peri- 
staltic woes of the small boy the night following the 
green apple episode are due to the tannic acid the unripe 
fruit contains. The three chief acids of fruit are citric 
acid, found in oranges, lemons, and grapefruit ; malic acid, 
as found in apples, pears, peaches, and similar fruits ; and 



Fruits and Their Dietetic Value 49 

tartaric acid, as found in grapes. These are organic acids, 
recognized and readily digested by the body. 

The acids of fruits are remarkable peptogens; that 
is, they stimulate the appetite and promote the flow of 
the digestive juices. Fruit acids are most efficient dis- 
infectants. Some years ago, an eminent medical au- 
thority of this country, in a representative medical gather- 
ing, said, "We are as yet without a satisfactory medicinal 
intestinal disinfectant." In fruit acids, we possess such 
an agent in a most desirable form. No germ, disease- 
producing or otherwise, can live in the presence of fruit 
acid. Fruit acids can be taken practically ad libitum. 
Fruit acids taken freely by mouth or diluted and injected 
into the bowel, most efficiently asepticize the intestinal 
canal. Three or four pints of water to which the juice 
of one lemon has been added, injected into the bowel fol- 
lowing a cleansing enema, will thoroughly destroy disease- 
producing bacteria in the colon. Flushing the bowel 
frequently with such a solution is one of the most efficient 
known means of successfully combating the fetid summer 
diarrheas of children. 

The proteid or nitrogenous element of fruits, as well 
as their fatty element, may be passed over with little 
consideration. Fruit contains little proteid; and aside 
from the olive, there is almost no fat in fruit. The fat 
of the ripe olive, however, is one of the most delicious 
and digestible forms of fat. Ripe olives contain about 
fifty per cent fat. Olive oil can be mixed with water; 
therefore it readily mixes with the intestinal juices, and 
is most easily digested. 

F7'uit Salts 

The salts of fruit are most desirable, being so essen- 
tial in tissue building. Some of the most important of 
these salts are potash, lime, phosphoric acid, and iron. 

4 — Food Question 



50 The Food Question 

Deficiency of the lime salts in the bones of children pro- 
duces conditions of bone softening, or rickets. This can 
be largely prevented by adding fruit to the diet of these 
afflicted children, using especially grapes, oranges, lemons, 
and grapefruit, which contain high percentages of lime 
salts. 

The condition of ansemia is a lack of iron in the blood. 
This cannot be replaced by medicinal or metallic iron, as 
the body is unable to appropriate these inorganic sub- 
stances; but the iron in fruit is perfectly adapted to the 
body needs. Plums, cherries, and especially strawberries 
and currants contain considerable iron, and are most 
helpful in the treatment of ansemic conditions. 

It is perfectly apparent that fruits possess qualities 
and constituents that make them of the greatest value 
as an essential part of the daily ration to nourish and 
energize the body, and to promote vital activities in the 
maintenance of strength and healthful vigor. Fruit is 
also an exceedingly important and efficient factor in re- 
storing to normal function tissues and organs that have 
become vitiated and are functionating abnormally. 

In spite of the widespread opinion to the contrary, 
it can be positively asserted that fruit is of great service 
in the prevention as well as in the treatment of rheu- 
matism and gout. The prejudice against the use of fruit 
in rheumatism originated with the idea that the acids 
of fruit tend to acidify the body. Quite the reverse is 
true. The acids of fruit, when taken into the body, are 
promptly converted into the alkali carbonates, thus in- 
creasing the alkalinity of the blood, tending greatly to 
benefit and cure the rheumatic condition, as well as to 
lessen the general tendency to the formation of various 
calculi, or stones, in the kidneys, the urinary bladder, and 
the gall bladder. 



Fruits and Their Dietetic Value 51 

Fruit and Obesity 

A fruit diet is of great value in obesity. An exclusive 
fruit diet may be taken to the greatest possible advantage 
by the too corpulent who wish to reduce in weight. For 
this purpose, fruit has the advantage of satisfying the 
appetite while at the same time contributing very little 
nutrition to the body. The free use of fruit is the method 
par excellence for overcoming constipation. The eating 
of a half dozen raw prunes before breakfast, or the taking 
of the juice of one or two oranges, will in the majority 
of cases be all that is necessary to maintain regular bowel 
activity. 

For an overworked liver, the so-called "bilious" state, 
fruit is the best of all means of relief. Auto-intoxication 
due to an excess of poisons circulating in the blood, is 
treated most naturally and efficiently by a fruit diet. 

The natural diuretic properties of fruit are very well 
known. Nearly all fruits stimulate the kidneys to greater 
activity, but watermelon is of particular service in this 
respect. 

Fruit and fruit juices greatly aid in successfully com- 
bating alcoholism. The acid of the fruit juices help ma- 
terially in quenching the abnormal thirst. 

There are but few individuals who would not be bene- 
fited by an occasional exclusive fruit meal; and in many 
cases, this can be maintained with greatest benefit for 
even several days. This is a very popular method of 
treatment in Europe, particularly in Switzerland, where 
the "grape cure" is utilized. Patients are placed upon 
a diet of grapes alone for several weeks, consuming from 
seven to ten pounds of grapes a day. Wonderful results 
are recorded at these resorts in the treatment of rheu- 
matism, gout, obesity, constipation, intestinal catarrh, 
liver and kidney disorders, high blood pressure, arterial 



52 The Food Question 

sclerosis, or hardening of the arteries, and many more 
physical disabilities. 

Certain fruits, especially tart apples, are of great value 
in the treatment of diabetes, lessening the toxaemia of 
this condition, as well as mitigating the abnormal thirst 
that is so frequent and often distressing an accompani- 
ment of this condition. 

In the eating of fruit, some care must be exercised 
not to swallow large seeds or fruit pits. While the danger 
of appendicitis from fruit seeds' becoming lodged in the 
appendix has been greatly exaggerated, yet fruit seeds 
have occasionally been found in the appendix, and proved 
the exciting cause of the inflammation which followed. 
Cases are on record of children who have swallowed con- 
siderable quantities of grape seeds, suffering for months 
of colic, and being only relieved by discharging quantities 
of these seeds during energetic purgation. 

It has been said that fruit is "gold in the morning, 
silver at noon, and lead at night." But fruit is golden all 
the time. This wonderful gift, one of the greatest and 
best physical gifts of an all-wise Providence, cannot be 
prized too highly ; for it is considered sufficiently valuable 
to endure for both time and eternity. Of the first man 
and woman, it was said that they might eat of the fruit 
of the trees of the garden; and it is said of the inhab- 
itants of the renewed earth, during eternity, that "they 
shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them." 



T^OO much good food makes one auto-toxic. Too much fun makes one asinine. 
But keep sunny. A cheerful disposition, a happy temperament, is the master 
key that unlocks more secrets, more riches, more success, than anything else. 
A sunny temper is an "aroma whose fragrance fills the air with an odor of 
Paradise." Burp everything that makes you unhappy* and discordant, everything 
that cramps your freedom and worries you. Burj) it before it buries you. Adopt 
the sundial's motto, "I record none but hours of sunshine." — Thomason. 




TEN REASONS FOR A 
FLESHLESS DIET 



by 

A. W. TRUMAN, A. B., M.D. 

Superintendent of Loma Linda Sanitarium, Loma 

Linda, California: Professor of Neurology, Loma 

Linda College 



1. The Strength Delusion 

Every movement we make, every thought we think, 
and every heart throb, involves waste and the expenditure 
of energy. There is a constant breaking down of our 
tissues ; and the food ingested is the source of the material 
for repair. By its oxidation, digestion, and assimilation, 
energy is liberated for life's varied activities. 

The primary object of taking food is, in the words of 
the wise man, "for strength, and not for drunkenness." 
Any one who makes the pleasure of eating the chief 
requisite will some day find, by a disordered stomach and 
a clogged liver, that eating has ceased to be a pleasure. 

The idea has long been current that superior quali- 
ties of body and mind come from eating flesh food; but 

(53) 



54 The Food Question 

the verdict of science, after long observation and careful 
investigation and various experiments, is rapidly revers- 
ing this opinion. 

The experiments of Prof. Russell H. Chittenden, 
president of the American Physiological Society, and di- 
rector of the Sheffield Scientific School at Yale, are con- 
vincing. His elaborate investigations, extending over long 
periods of time, prove that persons of widely varying 
habits of life, temperament, occupation, and constitution, 
can maintain and even heighten their mental and physical 
vigor while subsisting upon a diet containing but one half 
the usual amount of protein, and in which the flesh is 
reduced to a minimum or is entirely absent. 

The subjects of the first experiment were three phy- 
sicians, three professors, and a clerk, — men of sedentary 
and chiefly of mental occupation. For a period of six 
months, they were required to reduce the amount of meat 
and other protein food about one half. "Their weight 
remained stationary ; but they improved in general health, 
and experienced a quite remarkable increase of mental 
clearness and energy." 

Chittenden's Researches 

For his next experiment. Professor Chittenden used 
a detachment of twenty soldiers from the hospital corps 
of the United States army, "representing a great variety 
of tjTpes of different ages, nationality, temperament, and 
degrees of intelligence." For a period of six months, 
these men lived upon a ration in which the proteid was 
reduced to one third the usual amount, and the flesh to 
five sixths of an ounce daily. There was a slight gain in 
weight, "the general health was well maintained, and 
with suggestions of improvement that are frequently so 
marked as to challenge attention." "Most conspicuous, 
however," remarks Professor Chittenden, "was the effect 



Ten Reasons for a Fleshless Diet 55 

observed on the muscular strength of the various subjects. 
. . . Without exception, we note a phenomenal gain in 
strength which demands explanation." There was an 
average gain in strength for each subject of about fifty 
per cent. 

For the third experiment, Professor Chittenden se- 
cured as subjects a group of eight leading athletes of 
Yale, all in training trim. For five months, they sub- 
sisted upon a diet comprising from one half to one third 
the quantity of protein food they had been in the habit 
of eating. "Gymnasium tests showed in every man a 
truly remarkable gain in strength and endurance." 

Fisher's Experiments 

Dr. Irving Fisher, professor of political economy of 
Yale University, concluded a series of experiments test- 
ing the endurance of forty-nine persons, about thirty of 
the number being flesh abstainers. The first endurance 
test was that of "holding the arms horizontally." The 
flesh eaters averaged ten minutes. The flesh abstainers 
averaged forty-nine minutes. The longest time for a 
flesh eater was twenty-two minutes. The maximum time 
for a flesh abstainer was two hundred minutes. The 
second endurance test was that of "deep knee bending." 
The flesh eaters averaged three hundred eighty-three 
times, the flesh abstainers eight hundred thirty-three 
times. Professor Fisher explains the results on the basis 
that "flesh foods contain in themselves fatigue poisons of 
various kinds, which naturally aggravate the action of the 
fatigue poisons produced in the body." 

Dr. J. loteyko, head of the laboratory at the University 
of Brussels, compared the endurance of seventeen vege- 
tarians with that of twenty-five carnivores, students of 
the University of Brussels. "Comparing the two sets of 
subjects on the basis of mechanical work, it is found that 



56 The Food Question 

the vegetarians surpassed the carnivores on the average 
by fifty-three per cent." 

Professor Fisher remarks, "These investigations, with 
those of Combe of Lausanne, Metchnikoff, and Tisier of 
Paris, as well as Herter and others in the United States, 
seem gradually to be demonstrating that the fancied 
strength from meat is like the fancied strength from al- 
cohol, an illusion." 

Tests in Germany 

Professor Rubner, of Berlin, "one of the world's fore- 
most students of hygiene," read a paper before the recent 
International Congress of Hygiene and Demography on 
the "Nutrition of the People," in which he said: "It is 
a fact that the diet of the well-to-do is not in itself physio- 
logically justified; it is not even healthful; for on account 
of the false notions of the strengthening effect of meat, 
too much meat is used by young and old, and this is 
harmful." 

In the long distance races in Germany, the flesh ab- 
stainers have invariably been easy victors. Upon this 
point. Professor Von Norden, in his monumental work on 
"Metabolism and Practical Medicine," says : "In Germany 
at least, in these competitive races, the vegetarian is ahead 
of the meat eater. The non-vegetarian cannot compete 
with the vegetarian in the matter of endurance in these 
long distance walks. The vegetarian is ahead in the 
matter of rapid pedestrian feats." 

A few years ago, a well-known athlete. Dr. Deighton, 
walked from the southernmost point of England to the 
northernmost point of Scotland, a distance of almost a 
thousand miles, in twenty-four days and four hours. His 
chief subsistence en route was a much advertised meat 
juice. Mr. George Allen, who for a number of years had 
subsisted upon a strict non-flesh diet, undertook the same 



Ten Reasons for a Fleshless Diet 57 

task, which he accomplished in a little less than seventeen 
days, that is, in seven days less time. 

As in the heat engine, energy for light, heat, or power 
does not come from burning copper, lead, or iron filings, 
but from carbonaceous materials, as coal, coke, fuel oils, 
etc., so in the human body, energy for warmth and mus- 
cular effort comes not from oxidizing the metal repair 
foods, the proteins, but from those foods which are rich 
in carbon, the starches and the sugars, called the carbo- 
hydrates. 

2. Flesh Food a Stimulant 

Whence then come these "illusions," these "false no- 
tions of the strengthening effect of meat"? They come 
from the fact that foods of this class are stimulating. A 
stimulant is a counterfeit for strength. It is a physical 
deceiver. It makes a person believe he is strong because 
he "feels" strong, when it is not true at all. That which 
is interpreted as strength is only nervous excitement. A 
stimulant never builds up; it only stirs up. While pre- 
tending to contribute energy, it actually robs the body of 
strength. The resort to stimulants to whip up the flagging 
energies of the body is an effort to trick nature in playing 
the game of life. It is like borrowing money. Some day 
the principal must be returned with interest to a re- 
lentless creditor. 

Beef tea contains less than one per cent nourishment, 
but one can get the same kind of exhilaration from a cup 
of beef tea as from a cup of brandy. This is due to the 
drug effect of the beef tea, which is a solution of the waste 
products, the poisonous extractives, of the meat. Every 
animal organism is constantly throwing off these extrac- 
tives, such as urea, uric acid, creatinine, etc. The kidneys 
have no other function than the removal of poisons. If 
an animal is deprived of the use of its kidneys, it will die 



58 The Food Question 

of self-poisoning in a few days. When an animal is 
slaughtered and the blood ceases to circulate, this stream 
of urinary products on its way to the kidneys for excre- 
tion stops in the tissues, and is devoured by the con- 
sumer with the flesh. 

Friedenwald and Ruhrah, in their book "Diet in Health 
and Disease," say: "The extractives are probably of no 
value either as a source of energy or in the formation of 
tissues. They act as stimulants and appetizers, and it has 
been stated that the craving some individuals have for 
meat is in reality a desire for the extractives." 

Armand Gautier, the eminent French dietitian, says on 
this point, "Like the opium smoker, the individual who 
accustoms himself to meat, feels that he misses it when he 
does not take the usual excess." 

If the poisonous waste products be removed from meat, 
it is insipid, and is no more stimulating than the same 
amount of bread. 

3. Ptomaine Poisoning 

The seeds of death and decay are in every animal or- 
ganism ; and just as soon as the heart ceases to throb, and 
the arteries cease to pulsate, and the spark of life leaves 
the animal, decomposition begins. These putrefactive 
changes often result in the formation of violent poisons, 
called ptomaines. The word "ptomaine" comes from a 
Greek word meaning carcass, or cadaver; and the poisons 
are variously called putrefactive alkaloid, animal alkaloid, 
etc. The presence of fatal amounts of these poisons in 
flesh may not be betrayed by any change in appearance, 
odor, or taste. The common practice of keeping meat until 
it becomes tender, or "ripens," is simply waiting for de- 
composition to advance until the meat fiber is softened 
by the process of decay. Canned meats are especially 
liable to contain the poisonous ptomaine. 



Ten Reasons for a Fleshless Diet 59 

U. Unbalances the Diet 

It is of primary importance that one should guard 
against consuming excessive quantities of any kind of 
food material, but there is a difference. Should we take 
an excess of starches or sugars, provision has been made 
for storing a certain amount in the form of fat, or as 
glycogen in the liver and the muscles; but no provision 
is found for storing an excess of protein. An excess of 
this food element is of particular injury to the body. 
The extensive experiments of Professors Chittenden, 
Fisher, and other scientific workers, have shown that for 
efficient nutrition, we require that only one tenth of the 
daily intake of food should be of the structure-building, 
tissue-repairing protein. In the laboratory of nature, 
the food elements have been so combined by the plants, 
that the protein element is very low; and thus a diet 
selected from the natural products of the earth is not 
only free from uric acid and other waste products, but is 
already balanced. The addition of flesh food — which 
does not contain any starch — to the menu, at once raises 
the protein constituent too high. 

5. Bright's Disease and High Blood Pressure 

The waste products in the blood arising from excess 
of protein are a leading cause of Bright's disease, auto- 
intoxication, arteriosclerosis, and high blood pressure. 
These maladies are often associated in the same indi- 
vidual, and frequently have a common origin. Sir William 
Osier, in his ''Principle and Practice of Medicine," writes : 
"I am more and more impressed with the part played 
by overeating in inducing arteriosclerosis." 'There are 
many cases in which there is no other factor." Dr. 
Alexander Haig, of London, states that uric acid makes 
the blood "collaemic" or viscous, and then the heart has 
difficulty to pump it through the capillaries. Hence the 



60 The Food Question 

blood pressure increases. Isaac Ott, in his textbook on 
physiology, says on this point, "Burton-Opitz has shown 
that hunger reduces viscosity, and meat diet raises it to 
a great height, whilst carbohydrates and fat diet give 
average values to it." 

In the colon, flesh foods rapidly undergo decompo- 
sition, giving rise to numerous poisons, which are ab- 
sorbed into the blood, and are toxic to the nervous system, 
and cast an additional burden upon the liver and the 
kidneys. These are a sort of dietetic clinkers, which 
throw nature's delicate machinery out of adjustment, and 
produce various symptoms of auto-intoxication. Bou- 
chard found that the fecal and urinary excrement of 
carnivorous animals is twice as poisonous when injected 
into rabbits as that from a herbivorous animal. The 
former also emits a strong odor, and the fecal discharges 
are offensively repulsive. Dr. Haig, before quoted, also 
asserts that "Bright's disease is the result of our meat- 
eating and tea-drinking habits; and as these habits are 
common, so also is the disease." 

6. Tuberculosis, Ulcer, Cancer, and Appendicitis 

While it is true that tuberculosis is more frequently 
contracted through the use of tuberculous milk than from 
tuberculous meat, the latter source of infection cannot 
be ignored. Numerous cases of tuberculosis have been 
reported where the infection could be directly traced to 
the flesh of tuberculous animals. 

Dr. E. C. Shroeder, of the Bureau of Animal Industry 
of the United States Department of Agriculture, says : 
"That ten per cent of the dairy cattle in the United States 
are affected with tuberculosis impresses me as a very 
conservative estimate. In New York State, about thirty- 
three per cent of all cattle tested were found to be tuber- 
culous." Dr. Julius Rosenberg, of New York City, writes : 



Ten Reasons for a Fleshless Diet 61 

"Cattle tuberculosis is rapidly increasing. There is 
scarcely a dairy herd without a number of infected ani- 
mals. It is an ever growing menace. The health depart- 
ment of Boston estimates the percentage of tuberculous 
animals producing the city's milk supply to be from 
twenty to twenty-five per cent. Conservative estimate 
places the number of cows dying yearly from tubercu- 
losis at one million, were they permitted to die a natural 
death; but they are killed before drawing the last gasp, 
and served as prime beef." In one year in the United 
States, the entire carcasses of thirty-five thousand one 
hundred three cattle were condemned because of gener- 
alized tuberculosis. In the same year, a portion of the 
carcass of ninety-nine thousand seven hundred thirty- 
nine more were rejected because of local tuberculosis. 

Professor Ravenal, of the University of V/isconsin, 
says that of the thirty-five million hogs killed for food 
annually in the United States, seven million are found to 
be infected with tuberculosis. Some one has said that 
meat would sell for a dollar a pound if all the diseased 
meat were eliminated. 

Ulcer of the stomach is one of our most common 
diseases. Leading surgeons have shown that it is ten 
times as frequent as was formerly supposed. It is clearly 
of dietetic origin, and is usually associated with too high 
consumption of protein, and especially of meat. Starches, 
sugars, and fats are not digested in the stomach, and 
require no acid. Proteins, on the other hand, are digested 
within the stomach, and require for their digestion a high 
percentage of hydrochloric acid. The excessive produc- 
tion of acid within the stomach, stimulated by too much 
protein, is probably the chief cause of the formation of 
ulcers. In 1908, Dr. Fenton B. Turck, of Chicago, said 
before the American Medical Association : "Ulcer of the 
stomach is not found in those countries where the inhab- 



62 The Food Question 

itants eat rice. It is evidently a meat eater's disease. 
The zone of ulcer is in the meat eater's zone." 

Cancer is a disease of modern civilization. It is the 
one major unsolved problem in the field of medical science 
to-day. From the Journal of the American Medical As- 
sociation of June 14, 1913, we quote: "That cancer has 
increased in recent years is perhaps a commonplace, but 
the extent of the increase is not generally realized. Under 
existing conditions, one in seven women and one in eleven 
men die of cancer." In the Medical Record, issue of May 
15, 1915, Dr. W. G. Mayo is quoted as saying: "Cancer 
of the stomach forms nearly one third of all cancers of 
the human body. . . . Is it not possible that there is some- 
thing in the habits of civilized man, in the cooking or 
other preparation of his food, which acts to produce the 
precancerous condition ? . . . Within the last one hundred 
years, four times as much meat is taken as before that 
time. If flesh foods are not fully broken up, decomposi- 
tion results, and active poisons are thrown into an organ 
not intended for their reception, and which has not had 
time to adapt itself to the new function." 

Dr. L. Duncan Bulkley, senior physician to the New 
York Skin and Cancer Hospital, says on this point, "Ana- 
lyzing the various data obtained, we find that cancer has 
increased in proportion to the consumption of four ar- 
ticles, meat, coffee, tea, and alcohol." 

One is hardly up to date who does not present an 
abdominal scar caused by an offending appendix. At the 
fifteenth International Congress of Hygiene and Demog- 
raphy held in Washington, D. C, Dr. Henning contributed 
a paper dealing with "statistics upon the increase of ap- 
pendicitis and its causes." He said: "A meat diet is of 
great influence in the development of appendicitis. This 
diet leads to constipation. In most instances, too long 
retention of intestinal contents in the caecum causes slight 



Ten Reasons for a Fleshless Diet 63 

inflammation in that region, the results of which are to 
weaken the appendix, and to render it nonresistant 
against later infection." When Dr. Lorenz, the cele- 
brated Vienna surgeon, was in the United States, he 
called attention to the relatively greater prevalence of 
appendicitis in this country as compared with Europe, 
and attributed it to the greater consumption of cold 
storage meats here, which he said rendered Americans 
unduly septic, and especially prone to infection of the 
appendix. Nicholas Senn was told by the hospital sur- 
geons in Africa that they had never seen a case of ap- 
pendicitis in a vegetable-eating African. 

7. Trichinm and Tapeworms 

"A story is told of two of the most noted of Ger- 
mans, — Bismarck, the statesman, and Virchow, the scien- 
tist. The latter had severely criticized the former in his 
capacity as chancellor, and was challenged to fight a duel. 
The man of science was found by Bismarck's seconds 
in his laboratory, hard at work at experiments which had 
for their object the discovery of a means of destroying 
trichinae, then making ravages among animals in Ger- 
many. 'Ah,' said the doctor, 'a challenge from Prince 
Bismarck, eh? Well, well, as I am the challenged party, 
I suppose I have the choice of weapons. Here they are.' 
He held up two large sausages, which appeared to be 
exactly alike. 'One of these sausages,' he said, 'is filled 
with trichinae. It is deadly. The other is perfectly whole- 
some. Externally, they can't be told apart. Let his 
excellency do me the honor to choose whichever of these 
he wishes and eat it, and I will eat the other.' No duel 
was fought, and no one accused Virchow of cowardice." 

The trichina is a small, wormlike parasite found in 
the flesh of "measly pork," which, when eaten, burrows 
in the muscles of the human, producing an extremely 



64 The Food Question 

painful and often fatal affection. About two per cent 
of hogs, it is estimated, harbor this parasite. 

Practically speaking, the human being becomes the 
host of a tapeworm only by eating underdone flesh con- 
taining the larvse of the parasite. (Thoroughly boiled or 
fried tapeworm is a harmless diet.) The ox, the hog, 
and the fish frequently harbor the larvse of tapeworms. 

8. Poor Economy 

In these days of increased destruction and decreased 
production of human foods, it is of great importance to 
know how to secure a maximum amount of nutrition from 
a minimum expenditure of money. The world is facing 
a food shortage that in some places has assumed the 
proportion of the gaunt specter of famine. In view of 
this fact, it is well to remember that flesh is the most 
costly source of food. Sixty-two per cent of the best 
beefsteak is water. Flesh foods contain but twenty-five 
per cent nourishment, and seventy-five per cent waste 
matter. The grains contain seventy-five per cent nour- 
ishment, and but twenty-five per cent waste. Now it 
does not require a knowledge of higher mathematics to 
determine that since ten pounds of grain, when fed to 
an animal, make but one pound of flesh, the latter becomes 
a very costly source of our food supply. 

9. The Testimony of Anatomy and Physiology 

Even a kindergarten study of the structure of the 
human body reveals the fact that man was not intended 
to be a carnivorous, a herbivorous, or an omnivorous 
animal, but rather a frugivorous creature. He does not 
possess the rough, raspy tongue of the cat family, the 
long, pointed canine teeth of the lion, the sharp claws of 
the tiger, or the talons and hooked beak of the eagle. 
In the carnivora, the alimentary canal is very short, 



Ten Reasons for a Fleshless Diet 65 

being only three times the length of the body. In her- 
bivora, as the sheep, it is thirty times the length of the 
body. In frugivora, such as apes, monkeys, and man, it 
is twelve times the body length. Baron Cuvier, a famous 
anatomist, writes, "The natural food of man, judging 
from his structure, appears to consist principally of the 
fruits, roots, and other succulent parts of vegetables." 

10. Flesh and Morals 

The menu provided for man in the beginning did not 
include animal food. Not until one thousand six hundred 
fifty-six years of human history had passed was man 
permitted to eat flesh, and then only after every green 
thing had been destroyed by the Deluge. What we eat 
exercises a profound influence upon what we are, how 
we think, and how we feel. Let us divide the animal 
kingdom on the basis of diet and disposition. On the one 
hand, we have the lion, the tiger, the wolf, the bear, the 
leopard, the panther, etc, ; all these are vicious, snarly, 
crabbed, ferocious beasts. What comprises their diet? 
We call them "beasts of prey." They feast upon the 
bloody, quivering flesh of their victims. On the other 
hand, we might mention the horse, the ox, the deer, the 
sheep, the elephant. Think of their dispositions, calm, 
quiet, pacific, easily domesticated. May it not be that 
their diet of cereals and herbs contributes to their peace- 
ful temperament? 

Dr. Curtis, the eminent physician to Mr. Garfield, 
said, "What parent is there who has not viewed with 
alarm how old Adam enters into the baby along with the 
first spoonful of chopped beef!" Gautier said, on this 
point: "The vegetarian regime, modified by the addition 
of milk, of fat of butter, of eggs, has great advantage. 
It adds to the alkalinity of the blood, accelerates oxida- 
tion, diminishes organic wastes and toxins. It exposes

66 The Food Question 

one much less likely than the ordinary regime to skin 
maladies, to arthritis, to congestions of internal organs. 
This regime tends to make us pacific beings, and not ag- 
gressive and violent." 

To these we may add the testimony of Holy Writ, 
"Be not among winebibbers; among riotous eaters of 
flesh;" 




PKysical Benefits of J03) 



HE emotion of joy finds physiologic manifes- 
tations exactly opposite to those of sorrow 
and grief. There is increase of function in 
the muscles, and expansion of the blood ves- 
sels. As a result of increased muscular ac- 
tivity, the joyful person feels light and springy. Children, 
when joyful, dance and skip and clap their hands. The 
expansion of the blood vessels brings the "flush of joy." 
This increase in the circulation causes increased secretion 
of the digestive juices, with increased appetite, and in- 
creased power of digestion and absorption. This means 
increased nourishment. "Laugh and grow fat" has a phys- 
iologic basis. Fat people are not good-natured because they 
are fat, but they are fat because they are good-natured. 

Laughter has a wonderfully beneficial 
influence on bodily functions — a fact recog- 
nized centuries ago when the wise man 
said, "A merry heart doeth good like a 
medicine." Laughter is a potent stimu- 
lant to all the helpful bodily functions. It 
hastens digestion, stimulates circulatory 
reaction, promotes tissue changes, en- 
hances glandular activity, facilitates elimi- 
nation, and altogether radiates a most 
beneficent influence throughout the body. 
Laugh, and the whole body laughs, and 
counts its work a pleasure. — Dr. George

STIMULANTS and 
CON DIM ENTS 

by 

ARTHUR N. DONALDSON, A.B.,M.D. 

of the Faculty of the College of Medical 
Evangelists, Loma Linda, California 

The Creator intended that the process of eating 
should be enjoyed. He has gathered the tasteless, in- 
sipid food elements together, and mixing in mineral and 
organic accessories, has produced for the tickling of our 
palates all the numberless flavors that the combined ac- 
tion of those highly specialized organs of taste and smell 
have enabled us to enjoy. The tasteless starch is bound 
up in the palatable potato ; the insipid protein, in the pea, 
the lentil, and the bean; the rather nauseating fat, in 
the plump, appetizing olive. To the child not yet edu- 
cated to the perverted demands of his father's palate, the 
thought, taste, and smell of these aromatic and savory 
substances produces a desire to eat. By the time he is 
twenty, he will not be satisfied with the natural flavor 
of his food. The cook must pepper or ginger it up, and 

(67) 



68 The Food Question 

he must further mustard or Worcestershire it to get it 
down. His soups are hot, and his salads are hotter. The 
palatable pleasure in a meal of his childhood is a lost 
asset. What has brought about this change in the appe- 
tite of man ? 

We all know, from experience, that we handle our 
food better if we relish it. This is due largely to the 
fact that the taste organs telegraph ahead to the stomach 
to prepare for work. The stomach responds by pouring 
out some digestive juices, and is consequently all ready 
to begin business the instant the tourist arrives. But 
when the food is bolted, there is a failure on the part of 
the taste nerves to telegraph ahead, unless they are stimu- 
lated more intensely by the addition of some readily dif- 
fusible sapid substance. Are we thus fooling nature ? — 
We are not. Primarily, this unnatural stimulation leads 
to the most prevalent American dietetic sin; namely, 
overeating. We do not know when we have had enough. 
Dr. Wiggers, of Cornell University, has shown that over- 
eating results in the surcharging of the blood stream with 
elements of digestion ; and this, through the operation of 
physical laws, ultimately leads to arteriosclerosis and its 
chain of disasters. Secondly, with this unnatural stimu- 
lation of the taste nerves, the telegraphic messages to the 
stomach and the intestine are unreliable. Normally the 
tract is informed as to the nature of the food about to 
come, and is thus enabled to pour out a specific juice for 
a specific kind of food. Obviously this specificity which 
characterizes all normal processes is broken down, and 
the digestive function is placed under a handicap, when 
we cover up the natural taste with condiments. 

The idea that condiments and stimulants act favorably 
in directly stimulating the production of gastric juice and 
in increasing gastric motor activity, and thus facilitating 
the digestive process, is a delusion. Professor Carlson, 



Stimulants and Condiments 69 

of Chicago University, has shown that these so-called 
stomachics and appetizers will have done their bit ere 
they enter the misunderstood stomach. And, our savory 
sauces and peppers being irritants in the mouth, they are 
no less irritants to the lining membrane of the stomach. 
They are always taboo in mild dyspeptic disorders, yet 
we think them just the appetizers for the run down nerv- 
ous individual who never enjoys the pangs of hunger. 
Rather, he should be advised to oxygenate his impover- 
ished blood by a brisk walk, to stir up his eliminative or- 
gans by vigorous exercise and the ingestion of water; for 
these bring no gastric catarrh, no sluggish liver. 

It is recognized by every writer on dietetics, that con- 
diments are irritating to the organs of elimination. The 
kidneys suffer, the ureters suffer, the bladder suffers, 
and the urethra suffers. We are very quick to stop the 
use of these substances when the kidneys give evidence 
of disease, and we will with alacrity drop the hot stuff 
from our dietary when the bladder and the urethra are 
inflamed. We do not like the smarting, burning pain 
produced by their presence. If they are detrimental dur- 
ing disease processes, they are just as detrimental in 
health. The long continued use of minute quantities of 
an irritant will incontrovertibly give ultimate evidence 
of its harmful nature, and we may expect such pathol- 
ogy as congestion of the liver, catarrh of the alimentary 
tract, hemorrhoids, nephritis, and general nutritive dis- 
turbances to be the possible heritage of our stimulating 
diet. 

It is an interesting scientific fact that the highly sol- 
uble substances which. are used as foods or food acces- 
sories are always irritating to the living membranes, par- 
ticularly to the mucous membranes of the digestive or- 
gans with which they come in contact in the process of 
digestion, whether these membranes are healthy or dis- 



70 The Food Question 

eased. Among such substances, we may mention sugar 
and salt. 

Sugar and salt are excellent examples of the sapid, 
readily diffusible condiment so essential to our table, yet 
so invariably used to excess. We need about two tea- 
spoonfuls of common salt a day — especially those who 
enjoy the vegetarian diet. Most vegetables are rich in 
potassium. This inorganic substance combines with so- 
dium chloride, and is eliminated from the body. Conse- 
quently, the greater the amount of potassium in our food, 
the greater will be the loss of sodium chloride from the 
blood and the tissues, where it is an essential element, 
with the resultant need of an increased supply in our 
diet. Where there is an insufficient use of salt, there is 
a manifest disinclination to partake of the large variety 
of earth's products rich in potassium. But we are accus- 
tomed to the use of far more salt with our food than is 
necessary ; and in excess, it is positively harmful, and the 
results of its use are serious. 

Sugar is a pure carbohydrate; yet, by reason of its 
nature and use, it must be classed as a condiment. It, 
too, when used freely, brings on gastrointestinal catarrh 
through its direct irritant action, and affords unexcelled 
media for the growth of intestinal flora. 

Stimidants 

There are practically four strong stimulants to which 
civilized people are addicted ; namely, alcohol, tobacco, 
tea, and coffee. Of the action of all, it may be said that 
the fatigue of nerve and brain is soothed by a spur. That 
is the work of a stimulant, — to goad the worn system to 
added effort, to produce an abnormal, false energy. Thus 
the individual is led on to a state of actual exhaustion 
without a warning note from his fatigued system. His 
energy is actually dissipated rather than increased. The 



Stimulants and Condiments 71 

results are shown in his heart, his nervous system, and 
his eliminative organs. Admiral Peary, speaking of the 
use of coffee in the rations of polar explorers, states that 
with the added effect of intense cold, it so stimulates 
the nerves as to cause the men to exhaust themselves, 
and soon wear out, by doing more than they can endure. 

The actual extent of injury from the moderate use 
of tea and coffee has not been scientifically determined. 
The difficulty is, as Irving Fisher states it, "Sensitive 
people do not keep moderate." A little unnatural stimu- 
lation calls for a little more, and the tendency is to create 
a demand for something stronger. Fisher has truthfully 
declared that to abstain is much easier than to be 
moderate. 

The claim that alcoholic beverages give added strength 
is a fallacy. The narcotic action of alcohol benumbs the 
sense of fatigue. From reliable clinical and laboratory 
findings, we are warranted in asserting with authority 
that alcohol lowers the power of all mental processes. 
The muscular efficiency is reduced. The ability of the 
body to protect itself against disease is undermined. The 
policemen of the body — the white corpuscles — are ren- 
dered more or less inactive — paralyzed ; and the forma- 
tion of other resistive elements of the blood is restricted. 
In other words, vital resistance is below par. Alcohol 
is furthermore a heart and circulatory depressant, and 
is no longer used by competent physicians as a circulatory 
stimulant. In short, it lowers mental and physical effi- 
ciency, and of course will naturally give its stamp to the 
unfortunate offspring. 

Tobacco, too, blunts the edge of fatigue and worry. 
But its effect is transient, and the stimulation is folloAved 
by depression, which of course calls for more of the stim- 
ulant. Statistics tell us that where the weed is prohibited, 
efficiency is increased, and morale is improved. 



72 The Food Question 

Among the serious consequences of smoking, we find 
cancer of lip, tongue, and mouth, and serious cardiovas- 
cular changes. In a series of one hundred cases of cancer 
of the tongue and mouth. Dr. Abbe, of New York, found 
that ninety were inveterate users of tobacco ; and he gives 
the stimulant the credit of being the setiological factor in 
a high percentage of all malignant growths in this region. 
Tobacco not only directly affects the heart muscle, but 
its nicotine, through stimulation of the suprarenal gland, 
causes the production and throwing into the blood of an 
excessive amount of adrenalin, which brings about a tre- 
mendous rise in blood pressure, and of course an increase 
in the burden that the heart must carry. The ultimate re- 
sult is arteriosclerosis, tobacco heart, nephritis, and very 
possibly a closing of the scene with a paralytic stroke. 

Professor Fisher very aptly appeals against the intro- 
duction of more poisons into a system already burdened 
with poisons of its own elaboration. 

We are not at liberty to ignore nature and her laws. 
Our bodies are not our own. When the Creator has 
opened to us of heaven's abundance for the sustenance of 
life, and has given us a dietary that answers every need 
of palate and body, we are palpably in error before our 
Maker when we question His wisdom, and take into our 
systems those substances which we know to be destruc- 
tive to mind, soul, and body. 



^jUR country, however, is blessed witK an abundance of foodstuffs; and 
^-^ if our people will economize in their use of food, providently confining 
themselves to the quantities required for the maintenance of health and 
strength, if they will eliminate waste, and if they will make use of those 
commodities of which we have a surplus, and thus free for export a larger 
proportion of those required by the world now dependent on us, we shall 
not only be able to accomplish our obligations to them, but we shall obtain 
and establish reasonable prices at home. — Woodrow Wilson. 




SIMPLE MENUS and RECIPES 

by 

Mr. H. S. ANDERSON 

Food Specialist, College of Medical Evangelists and 
Loma Linda Sanitarium 

The art of planning and combining the food for a meal 
is of no small importance to the housewife or the cook. 
The very best foods may be served in such combmations 
as to bring distress to the digestive organs, and produce 
weakness instead of strength. ^ 

Because human beings differ so much, and their needs 
are so varied, it is impossible to lay down any set of rules 
on diet alike for all. There are general principles, how- 
ever, by which all may be guided, and which, if heeded, 
can accomplish more for the individual or the family, m 
maintaining health, than all doctors' prescriptions This 
is made plain by the fact that it is better to know how tc 
keep well than how to cure disease. 

It is therefore of great importance for those who havt 
the responsibility of planning for the table, to have £ 
working knowledge of the principles which guide m mak 

ing out a balanced menu. 

(73) 



74 The Food Question 

In the planning of a meal, careful study should be 
given to the combination of foods. On the one hand, only 
such foods as digest well together should be used at one 
meal. On the other hand, foods should be chosen that 
will supply all the needed elements in about the right pro- 
portion. 

Because of the woody substances found in vegetables, 
especially the coarse or fibrous vegetables, such as carrots, 
beets, turnips, cabbage, potatoes, and others, they digest 
slowly, and consequently remain a long time in the stomach 
before they are broken sufficiently for intestinal digestion. 
Fruits remain in the stomach a short time, and, owing to 
the large amount of saccharine matter they contain, are 
apt to ferment if retained too long. 

Fruit and vegetables therefore should not be eaten at 
the same meal. This has special reference to the coarse 
and underground vegetables; while the finer or fruity 
vegetables, such as green peas, corn, squash, tomatoes, 
etc., and some others which also ripen in the sun, may be 
used with almost any food. 

A safe rule in planning a meal, is to be sure that the 
soup, the relishes (greens, salads, etc.), and the dessert, 
if used, combine well together, as these are so generally 
used by nearly all classes of people when placed on the 
menu. Then if fruit is used, in salad, or as dessert, there 
should be on the menu at least one of the finer vegetables, 
such as tomatoes, corn, or the like, which can be eaten 
with the fruit; and if the meal is planned without fruit, 
any of the coarser vegetables may be used as desired. 

A large variety should not be planned for any one 
meal. It is a great additional expense ; and besides, when 
several articles are taken at one meal, fermentation is 
likely to occur and the system will not be so well nour- 
ished. Recent research work has shown that the diges- 
tive juices vary both in kind and in quantity with differ- 



Simple Menus and Recipes 75 

ent kinds of food eaten. This may explain why many 
persons cannot digest complex mixtures and extensive 
variety, and is a mighty argument for simplicity at meal- 
time. 

A select variety, of only a few kinds of food, at any 
one meal, with diversity in the meals from day to day, 
will prove advantageous to the individual and the family, 
both from the standpoint of economy, and from the health 
point of view. 

An excess of milk and sugar taken together clogs the 
system, and should be avoided. Fats are more digestible 
cold than hot, because hot fat tends to coat and intimately 
penetrate the food with which it is cooked. This is espe- 
cially true of fried foods, part of the food being sur- 
rounded with a layer of fat, keeping the digestive juices 
from acting on the other food elements. When subjected 
to a high temperature, fats decompose, and the resulting 
acids are very irritating to the mucous membranes of 
the stomach and the intestines. 

The following combinations of food digest well to- 
gether : 

Grains, fruits, and nuts 

Grains with milk 

Grains with eggs 

Grains, vegetables, and nuts 

Foods that do not digest well together are : 

Milk and sugar taken together, in large quantities 
Fruit and vegetables 
Foods cooked in fats 

A balanced dietary is one that supplies in about the 
right proportion all the kinds of food required to nourish 
the body. From the earliest impressions of childhood, 
many persons have received the idea that the most im- 
portant article of diet is animal flesh. In most cases, this 
idea has been accepted without question or thought, and 
probably has never been challenged. A careful study of 



The Food Question 



the subject, however, will show that with the use of meat, 
there is great danger of an excess of protein above the 
minimum requirements, there being thus placed upon the 
liver and the kidneys an amount of work which should 
not be imposed on these vitally important organs. 

To combine foods in such a way as to supply all the 
needed elements, we should choose something from each 
of the different classes of food elements. There should 
also be among these such as supply sufficient cellulose and 
mineral. To illustrate this point, a few menus will be 
given that are extremely unbalanced, or one-sided, that 
we may understand more forcibly, by contrast, what a 
good meal is : 



1. Soy bean soup 
Lentil patties 
Cottage cheese 
Custard pie 
Milk 

2. Wliite rice 
Mashed potato 
Spaghetti 
White crackers 
Butter 

Cake 

3. Vegetable soup 
Wax beans 
Lettuce 
Stewed beets 
Bran biscuit 
Strawberries 



Too much building food 
Too concentrated 
Too little bulk 



Too much fuel food 

Too little bulk and mineral 

Lacks building food (protein) 



Too little building food 
Too little fuel food 
Too bulky 

Lacking in nourishiupnt 
Bad combination 



In order to make a balanced meal out of the above 
foods, it would be necessary to choose something from 
each of these unbalanced meals, and it would not be neces- 
sary to choose a large variety in order to supply the needs 
of the body. Upon examination, we find that bread (en- 
tire wheat) possesses properties which so nearly repre- 
sent the constituent parts of the body as to make such 
bread ideal for the building up and keeping in repair of 



\ Simple Menus and Recipes 77 

the human body. In the matter of building food (pro- 
tein), bread contains about ten per cent, or about the 
recognized dietary requirement. 

Bread is an exceedingly digestible food; and experi- 
ments taken as a whole show nearly ninety-eight per cent 
of the starch, or carbohydrate nutrients, and about 
eighty-eight per cent of the gluten, or protein constitu- 
ents, assimilated by the body. See Snyder's "Human 
Foods," page 179 ; also table, page 23. 

Many other grains, such as corn, oats, rye, barley, and 
rice, all contain heat- and energy-producing substances 
and tissue-forming elements in about the right propor- 
tion to meet the needs of the body. Exception is made of 
rice, which is slightly deficient in protein. 

Bread of some kind, therefore, is the "backbone" of 
the meal. Around it are grouped the various fruits and 
vegetables for change and variety, alternating with one 
of the more solid foods, rich in protein, such as cottage 
cheese, eggs, nuts, or any of the various legumes, as peas, 
beans, lentils, etc. Of all the legumes, the soy bean takes 
the lead for building food, containing nearly twice the 
per cent of protein found in round steak. These more 
hearty foods should be used with discretion, especially 
during the summer months, when well baked breads, 
fruits, and green garden products constitute the ideal diet. 

Potatoes, which are mostly starch, and eggs, which are 
largely albumen and fat, may be combined in such a way 
as to furnish all the needed elements in the right propor- 
tion. As rice is nearly all starch, and beans are rich in 
protein, these make an excellent combination. Nuts, rich 
in proteins and fats, and fruits, containing sugars and 
acids, also make an ideal combination. To a meal com- 
posed largely of rice and potatoes, which are deficient in 
fats, there may be added a little cream, a few ripe olives, 
a few nuts, or an egg, to give a well balanced ration. 



78 The Food Question 

The custom of eating a light lunch at noon, and reserv- 
ing the heaviest meal for the close of the day, while ac- 
tuated to a great extent by seeming necessities, or. con- 
venience, is not, as a rule, found a benefit to health. As 
a result of a hearty meal at night, the digestive process 
is continued through the sleeping hours; and though the 
stomach works constantly, its work is not properly accom- 
plished. The sleep is often disturbed by unpleasant 
dreams; and in the morning, the person awakes unre- 
freshed, and with little relish for breakfast. 

The practice of eating but two meals a day is gen- 
erally found a benefit to health; yet under some circum- 
stances, persons may require a third meal. This should, 
however, if taken at all, be very light, and of foods very 
easily digested, so that when we lie down to rest, the 
stomach may have its work all done, and it, as well as the 
other organs of the body, may enjoy rest. 

In the following menus, some allowance is made for 
variety. Some persons will not require everji;hing named 
on the menu; and each person will choose such things, 
and in such amounts, as experience and sound judgment 
prove to be best suited to his own necessities.

shamed Rice. — Wash one cup of natural brown rice, and 
put to cook in three cups of boiling water. Let boil gently 
until the water is absorbed and the rice looks dry; then set 
on the edge of the stove, well covered, to steam for fifteen 
minutes. 

Cream Peas on Toast. — One cup drained green peas, one 
third cup water, three tablespoonfuls rich cream, salt. Bring 
the water and the peas to a boil, mash through a colander to 
remove the hulls, and season with cream and salt. Dip a 
slice of zwieback into hot milk to soften, lay on a platter, cover 
with a spoonful of the cream of peas, and serve. 

Corn Bread. — One and one third cups corn meal, two table- 
spoonfuls whole wheat flour, two and one half tablespoonfuls 
vegetable butter, two tablespoonfuls brown sugar, one and one 
fourth teaspoonfuls salt, one and one third cups boiling water, 
two eggs. Mix all the dry ingredients in a bowl. Add the 
butter, and pour on the boiling water in a sloio stream, stirring 
while it is being poured in. Add two or three tablespoonfuls 
of cold water if needed to make a medium batter. Separate the 
eggs, and beat the whites stiff. Beat the yolks, and fold them 
into the whites. Add the corn mixture, and mix, using the 
folding motion. Pour into an oiled shallow baking pan, and 
bake in a quick oven. 

Butter Substitutes 

Owing to the great increase in disease among animals, and 
along with this, the advance in prices of nearly all foodstuffs, 
a desire has been created for some substitute for dairy butter, 
which would prove both wholesome and appetizing. The fol- 
lowing butter substitutes are now used to some extent both 
for cooking and for table use, and are easily prepared : 

Emulsified Vegetable Oil. — Secure a high grade cotton- 
seed, corn, or peanut oil. Beat one egg slightly, then add the 
oil in a very slow stream at first, beating continuously, and in- 
crease as the egg takes up the oil. Add two teaspoonfuls 
lemon juice, then more oil, until three cupfuls have been used, 
and the mixture is smooth and thick. Salt to taste, put into 
a well covered jar, and use the same as butter. 

Vegetable Butter. — Take three cupfuls of any good coco- 
nut product on the market, such as kokofat or kaola, or a 
good brand of hydrogenated vegetable fat, as crisco.* Add 
the juice of half a lemon, salt to taste, and a few drops of 
vegetable butter color. Mix with a spoon until the color of 

*NOTE. — The presence of a proprietary substance in a recipe must not be under- 
stood as guarantee by the authors. We know very little regarding the manufacture 
of the above named products; but we have reason to believe they are wholesome, 
and contain no animal products. 



80 The Food Question 

dairy butter. The juice from carrots, grated and pressed, 
may be used instead of the lemon juice and the butter color 
if desired. 

In harmony with the recent food pledge, saying, "Use no 
butter in cooking," all the recipes in these menus are pre- 
pared without the use of dairy butter. However, the same 
recipes may be prepared with dairy butter instead of the 
vegetable fats if so desired. 

Beans with Noodles. — Wash one cup navy or Lima beans, 
add three cups water and a little salt, and let boil gently until 
tender. Beat one egg slightly, with two teaspoonfuls of water 
or milk and a pinch of salt. Add one cup of pastry flour, or 
enough to make a stiff dough. Knead well, and divide into 
two pieces. Roll out into thin sheets about the thickness of 
paper, having the dough well floured. Let dry a few minutes, 
then cut into strips about two inches wide. Lay in tiers, and 
shred very fine with a sharp knife. Drain the liquid from the 
beans, add to it enough water to make three cups of liquid, and 
add salt to taste. Add two teaspoonfuls of vegetable butter, 
and bring to a boil. Sprinkle the noodles into the boiling 
broth, and let cook gently for fifteen minutes. Add the cooked 
beans, and shake together, reheat, and serve. New peas may 
be substituted for beans when in season. 

Corn on Cob. — Husk full ears of corn, and brush off the 
silks with a stiff brush. Wash, and drop into boiling water to 
which has been added a little milk or lemon juice. Bring to a 
good boil; then draw the saucepan to one side of the stove, 
and let simmer for twenty minutes. 

Entire Wheat Bread. — Three cups warm water, one half 
cake compressed yeast, three tablespoonfuls brown sugar, two 
tablespoonf uls vegetable fat, one tablespoonful salt, seven cups 
entire wheat flour. Dissolve the yeast in two teaspoonfuls 
of water, add the liquid, and mix all the ingredients to a 
medium soft dough. Turn out on a slightly floured board, 
and knead until elastic to the touch; then return to an oiled 
bowl, cover, and let stand in a warm room to rise until, when 
tapped sharply, it begins to sink (about two hours). Work 
down well, turn over in the bowl, and let rest until it begins 
to rise again (about fifteen minutes) ; then mold into loaves, 
and put into pans for baking. Brush over the top of each loaf 
with an oiled brush, and let rise until half again its original 
bulk; then bake in a good oven. These coarse breads must be 
watched closer during the rising than those made from white 
flour, as they get light in much less time. 

Creamed Rice. — Heat some milk in a double boiler, and 
when it is hot, add enough cooked rice to have it creamy, but 



\ Simple Menus and Recipes 81 

not too soft. Add a pinch of salt, and a little rich cream, if 
you have it at hand, and serve. 

Corn Mtal Crisps. — One cup white corn meal, one cup pas- 
try flour, one half teaspoonful salt, one tablespoonful brown 
sugar, two tablespoonfuls vegetable fat, scant one half cup 
water. Mix all the dry ingredients, add the oil, and rub 
between the hands to distribute the fat through the grain. 
Add the water, and mix to a dough. Roll out to a thickness 
of *Dne fourth of an inch, cut with a biscuit cutter, prick with 
a fork, and bake in a hot oven, to a light brown. 

Zwieback. — Cut stale bread into slices about one half inch 
thick. Lay these in a baking pan, and put them into the 
warming oven until the moisture is evaporated; then put 
them into a hot oven until they are a light brown all the way 
through.

vegetable butter, one fourth teaspoon salt, one cup milk, one 
egg. Make a batter of the flour, the salt, the milk, the egg 
yolk, and the butter, and stir smooth. Beat the white stiff, 
and pour the batter into the beaten white, mixing as it is 
being poured in, and using the folding motion, so as not to 
break down the lightness of the egg. Pour into hot oiled iron 
gem pans, and bake in a quick oven. 

Stewed Prunes. — Wash dried prunes thoroughly, and let 
them soak overnight. Then bring them to a boil, and let 
simmer for two hours or more, and they will need no sweet- 
ening. 

Farmer's Favorite Soup. — One half cup rich sour cream, 
one third cup macaroni, one small onion, one stalk celery, one 
small carrot, one medium sized potato, chopped parsley, salt. 
Drop the macaroni into three cupfuls boiling salted water, and 
cook until thoroughly done. Have the vegetables cut into 
small dice. Put the cream into a small pan, and stir over the 
fire until the oil separates, and the albumen turns a light 
brown color. The degree of browning determines the flavor 
of the soup. Add the diced onion, carrot, and celery, and stir 
for a few moments. Add three cupfuls water, the diced po- 
tato, and a little salt, and cook until the vegetables are 
thoroughly done. Add the macaroni water to the vegetable 
soup; then lay the macaroni on a board, cut into small rings, 
and drop into the soup. Boil up well, add chopped parsley, 
and serve. 

Roasted Potato. — Peel eight medium sized potatoes, and 
boil until they are about half done; then drain them, and save 
the water. Lay the potatoes in an oiled baking pan, brush with 
oil, sprinkle with salt and flour, and put into a hot oven to 
brown. 

Baked Dressing. — Two cups soaked stale bread, one half 
cup milk, three tablespoonf uls chopped onion, one and one half 
tablespoonfuls vegetable butter, three tablespoonfuls browned 
flour, a pinch of sage and marjoram, and salt to taste. Soak 
the bread in cold water until it is soft all the way through, 
then press it out. Put the butter, the onion, and the savory 
into a small pan, and let them simmer for a few moments, to 
soften the onion, but do not brown. Add the brown flour, then 
the milk, and stir smooth. Add the bread, salt to taste, and 
mix. Bake in an oiled brick tin, or spread among the roasted 
potatoes when they are partly browned, and finish baking 
them together. 

Egg Gravy. — Two tablespoonfuls vegetable fat, one tea- 
spoonful chopped onion, three tablespoonfuls flour, one egg, 



\ Simple Menus and Recipes 83 

\ 
one and one half cups potato water or almost any vegetable 
broth. Put the oil into a frying pan, and when it is quite hot, 
add the whole egg. Break the yolk with a fork, turn it over, 
and stir until brown over the entire surface. Remove the 
brown egg from the oil, and chop with a knife. Add the flour 
to the oil, and stir until a light brown. Add the onion, and 
stir ; then the chopped egg and one third of the water, and stir 
smooth. Add the balance of the water, and boil up. Let 
simmer for ten minutes, and serve. The egg may be omitted, 
if desired ; but without it, the gravy will have less flavor. 

Spinach. — Wash the greens in several waters. If the 
spinach is young and tender, it can be cooked with no addi- 
tional water beyond that remaining on the leaves after wash- 
ing. As the spinach ages, it absorbs bitter flavor, and should 
then be cooked in boiling water, with the cover off. When 
done, drain, cut with a knife, season with salt and a little 
vegetable butter, reheat, and serve. 

Rye Bread. — Two cups warm water, one half cake com- 
pressed yeast, one and one half tablespoonfuls vegetable fat, 
two tablespoonfuls brown sugar, two teaspoonfuls salt, four 
cups white bread flour, three cups rye flour. Dissolve the 
yeast in two teaspoonfuls water, add the liquid, and beat in 
three cups best bread flour to a smooth batter. Cover, and 
let stand in a warm room to rise for one and one half hours. 
Add the salt, the sugar, and the oil, and beat into the sponge. 
Mix in the rye flour and the remaining cup of white flour, to 
a medium dough. Knead on a board until elastic to the touch, 
then return to an oiled bowl, cover, and let rise the same as for 
entire wheat bread, in Sunday's lesson. When ready to mold 
into loaves, roll out six buns, and lay on an oiled pie tin, and 
let rise for rye biscuit. Divide the remaining dough into 
two parts, and roll out into the shape of ordinary rye bread 
loaves. Lay in an oiled baking pan, leaving space between. 
Brush with an oiled brush, and cut three gashes across each 
loaf with a sharp knife, and let rise until light, then bake in 
a quick oven. 

Baked Banana. — Select firm, rather ripe bananas, put them 
into the oven without removing the skins, and bake until the 
skins burst. Then remove from the oven, and serve in a 
folded napkin. 

Tomato Sandwiches. — Peel ripe tomatoes without scalding, 
by first scraping them with the back of a knife ; then cut into 
thin slices. Cut bread into very thin slices, and spread one 
slice with butter, and the opposite slice with mayonnaise or 
boiled dressing. Lay tomatoes between the slices, cut in tri- 
angles, and serve.

amount of water must be increased proportionately. 

Corn Dodgers. — One cup corn meal (preferably toasted 
lightly in the oven), one and one half tablespoonfuls vegetable 
fat, one half teaspoonful salt, one tablespoonful brown sugar, 
one and one half cups boiling water. Mix all the dry ingre- 
dients, add the fat and pour on the boiling water and stir

Add the onions whole, and put into a saucepan with water 
enough to cover the vegetables, and salt, and bring to a boil. 
Separate the cabbage leaves, and drop them into another ves- 
sel of boiling water, to blanch them for five minutes; then 
drain, and add to the boiling vegetables. Add the potatoes, 
and let boil gently until nearly done; then add the vegetable 
butter, and let simmer until thoroughly done. 

Cream Rice Pudding. — One half cup uncooked white rice, 
five cupfuls milk, scant one third cup sugar, vanilla flavor. 
Wash the rice thoroughly, add the milk, and cook in a double 
boiler for three fourths of an hour. Add the sugar and the 
vanilla flavor, and pour into an oiled baking pan and bake in 
a moderate oven. As soon as the first crust forms, stir it 
down, at the same time stirring the rice. Then allow the last 
crust to form and brown, and remove from the oven.

half tablespoonfuls mayonnaise dressing and one teaspoonful 
lemon juice, and mix well. Spread between slices of thinly 
buttered bread, cut in triangles, and serve. 

Rye Wafers. — One cup rye flour, one cup pastry flour, two 
and one half tablespoonfuls vegetable fat, two tablespoonfuls 
brown sugar, one half teaspoonful salt, one half cup water, 
or barely enough to mix to a stiff dough. Mix all the dry in- 
gredients, add the oil, and rub the flour between the hands to 
distribute the oil evenly. Add the water very slowly, stirring

cooked on a hot stone in fireless overnight. 

Plain Omelet. — One egg, one tablespoonf ul milk, a pinch of 
salt. Beat the yolk until thick, add the milk, and mix well. 
Add a pinch of salt to the white, and beat stiff. Fold the yolk 
into the white, and pour the mixture into a hot oiled fry pan, 
and set into the oven until just barely set. While still in the 
pan, turn one half of the omelet over the other half, by slip- 
ping a knife under one side and turning it over on the other 
section. Invert on a hot platter, and serve. 

Corn Meal Puffs. — One cup pastry flour, one third cup 
corn meal, one half teaspoonful salt, two teaspoonfuls vege- 
table butter, one scant cup milk, one egg separated. Make a 
batter of the milk, the flour, the corn meal, the salt, the melted 
fat, and the egg yolk, and stir smooth. Beat the white stiff, 
and fold the batter into it. Pour into hot oiled iron gem pans, 
and bake in a quick oven. 

Vegetable Julienne Soup. — One medium small potato, one 
small carrot, one small turnip, one stalk celery, one half cup 
cauliflowerlets or string beans, peas, or any fresh green vege- 
table, one small tomato, one teaspoonful vegetable butter, two 
cups cold water, two cups vegetable broth, salt to taste. Cut 
all the coarse vegetables into very thin shreds, and put into a 
small pan with the vegetable butter and one fourth cup water, 
and let simmer until the moisture is absorbed; then add the 
rest of the water, and boil up. Add the cut potato and tomato 
and the vegetable broth. Salt to taste, and let cook until the 
vegetables are thoroughly done. Add a sprinkle of chopped 
parsley, and serve. 

Macaroni Family Style. — One cup macaroni raw, one cup 
tomato pulp, one tablespoonful vegetable butter, one tablespoon- 
ful chopped onion, a sprinkle of sage or thyme, one egg, and 



Simple Menus and Recipes 87 

salt to taste. Break the macaroni into inch lengths, drop into 
salted boiling water, and let cook until thoroughly done; then 
drain in a colander^ Put the butter, the onion, and the savory 
into a small pan, and simmer for a few moments, but do not 
brown. Add the tomato, bring to a boil, and salt to taste. 
Pour the hot sauce into the egg, stirring as it is being poured 
in. Add the cooked macaroni, pour all into an oiled baking 
pan, and bake to a light brown. 

String Beans. — Select young and tender beans, string them, 
and break them into short lengths. Wash, and lift them out 
of the water ; put into a saucepan with enough boiling water to 
cover the beans. Add salt, and let cook gently, having the 
cover drawn to one side of the saucepan. When done, add a 
little vegetable butter and serve. When the beans are aged, 
they should be lifted out of the water and put into a covered 
vessel containing a little hot vegetable oil, and stirred over the 
fire for ten minutes before the water is added to them; and 
when cooked, they will be very tender. 

Raised Corn Bread. — In order to incorporate in corn bread 
enough moisture so that it will not dry out after baking, a 
certain proportion of the liquid used may be poured over the 
meal boiling hot; thus the needed moisture is absorbed before 
making into bread, as follows: 

Three cups water, one half cake compressed yeast, four 
cups best bread flour, two cups corn meal, one tablespoon salt, 
three tablespoons sugar, two tablespoons vegetable fat. Sift 
the flour into a large bowl, and leave space at one side of the 
flour for the sponge. Dissolve the yeast in two teaspoons 
water, add one cup warm water, and pour on one side of the 
flour. Stir enough flour into this liquid to make a thin, smooth 
batter. Cover, and set in a warm room until light (about one 
and one half hours). Put the corn meal into a small bowl, 
and pour on gradually, in a slow stream, two cups boiling 
water, stirring as it is poured in, and let stand one half hour. 

When the sponge is sufficiently light, add the salt, the 
sugar, and the vegetable fat, and mix well. Add the scalded 
and warm corn meal, and mix all into a soft dough. Turn 
out on a floured board, and knead until elastic to the touch. 
Then return to an oiled bowl, cover, let rise, and finish the 
same as for entire wheat bread. 

Wheat Gruel. — Take the steamed wheat left over from 
breakfast, add water to cover, and let cook gently until well 
done. Mash through a strainer, season with salt and a little 
cream or canned milk, and serve. 

Rye Sticks. — The recipe for rye sticks is given following 
the recipe for rye wafers in Tuesday's lesson.

salted vv^ater, and cook the same as macaroni, or about fifteen 
minutes. Drain well, saving the liquid for gravies or sauces. 
Make a cream sauce by rubbing together in a saucepan two 
tablespoonfuls vegetable butter and two tablespoonfuls flour; 
then add one third cup hot milk, and stir smooth. Add two 
thirds cup more milk, boil up, and salt to taste. Add enough 
of the cream sauce to the noodles to flavor them and not have 
them too soft. Pour into an oiled baking pan, and grate fresh 
bread crumbs over the top, pressing them down with a spoon 
to moisten them. Sprinkle with cream or bits of butter, and 
bake to a nice brown.

wheat flour, one half teaspoonful salt, two and one half table- 
spoonfuls vegetable fat, two tablespoonfuls brown sugar, scant 
one half cup water, or barely enough to mix the flour to a stiff 
dough. Mix all the dry ingredients, add the fat, and rub be- 
tween hands to distribute the oil evenly. Add the water very 
slowly, stirring meantime; and as soon as the flour can be 
worked together by sufficient moisture, lay on the board, and 
work for a few moments ; then roll out to one third inch thick- 
ness. Cut into strips one third inch in width, then crosswise 
into sticks three inches long. Lay in a baking pan, leaving 
a little space between, and bake to a very light brown. 

Buckwheat Wafers. — Take the above dough, roll out one 
fourth inch thick, cut with a biscuit cutter, prick with a fork, 
and bake the same as sticks.

The USE of LEFT-OVERS 

by 

Dr. LAVINA BAXTER-HERZER 

Department of Pathology and Bacte- 
riology, College of Medical Evangelists, 
Loma Linda, California 



At the present time, when the conservation of food 
is such a vital question, the use of left-overs becomes a 
very important matter for consideration. The following 
are a few simple suggestions that may prove helpful. 

First of all, we should plan, as far as possible, to 
avoid having much food left. One of the simplest means 
of accomplishing this is to serve fewer foods at a meal. 
Variety may be had at different meals. 

By planning beforehand, we can serve such foods at 
one meal as will combine nicely when warmed the next 
day or the next meal. 

For example: In all large hotels, when navy bean soup 
is served army style, carrots are always served in some 
way. In order to make the broth sufficiently rich, more 
beans are cooked than are served as soup. The next day, 

(93) 



94 The Food Question 

these, with the carrots, are put through a soup strainer, 
properly seasoned, and served as puree a la Crecy. 

Again, when planning tomato rice soup, cook a little 
extra rice in the tomato broth. When serving the soup, 
use only what rice is necessary. The thick remainder is 
very good baked in some acceptable preparation the next 
day. A little grated onion or a chopped bell pepper may 
be used for seasoning, if desired. 

A Housewife's Test 

After meals, the first thing that should claim the 
housewife's attention is the food that remains uneaten. 
Just here is one of the tests of her ability to do her part 
in conserving her family food supply. It is quicker, per- 
haps, to scrape everything into the garbage pail ; and it 
is said that at least twenty per cent of all foods brought 
into American kitchens is lost in this way. This loss 
either decreases the amount of food the family should 
have, or raises the cost of living that much. 

If food is to be kept over, it should be put into dishes 
of proper size, and put in a cool place, away from the 
flies and the dust. The sooner these left-overs are used, 
the better, as they naturally deteriorate by standing. 

In case of fresh fruit, it may be heated, if there is 
any doubt as to its keeping. 

Apple peelings and cores make excellent jelly, as most 
of the pectin is found near the skin and the seeds. Care 
should be taken to wash the apples well before paring, 
and remove any wormy parts. 

All butter scraps should be saved, and may be used 
for cooking. If the family is properly taught, however, 
there will be very little left on the plates. 

Left-over bread may be used for toast, bread pudding, 
or pressed fruit pudding, if unbroken. The broken pieces 
and the crumbs may be dried and used for dressing, or 



The Use of Left-Overs 95 

broken or rolled and served with milk instead of fresh 
bread. 

Buns, muffins, and gems may be moistened and re- 
heated. A loaf of very stale bread may be freshened in 
the same way. 

Left-over vegetables may be reheated, and used for 
salad, or for flavoring soups, if put through a soup 
strainer. 

Salads do not keep well; and for that reason, care 
should be taken not to prepare more than is likely to be 
eaten. If a little is left, it may be used for a pick-up 
lunch, perhaps. Small portions of dessert may be used 
in the same way. 

Milk or cream that is left may be sterilized and put 
in a cool place. 

Left-over grains may be used for making gruels, which 
are very good for lunch; or if only a small amount re- 
mains, it may be used for thickening soup. If there is 
a sufficient amount, steamed raisins or dates may be 
added, and then it may be put into molds to cool. This 
may be served with cream or some pudding sauce, mak- 
ing a simple dessert for either dinner or lunch. Cream 
of wheat, rolled wheat, farina, and Graham are especially 
nice served in this way. 

Many housewives cook an extra amount of corn meal 
in order to have some left, as it is better warmed up than 
at the first. It is good mixed with croutons, rolled in 
corn flakes, browned, and served with jelly or maple sirup. 
To mix with rice or any nut food, season, form into pat- 
ties, and serve with tomato sauce, is another method. 

When warming potatoes, if the supply is scant, many 
persons add a slice of stale bread broken up. 

The vegetable loaf given in Mr. Anderson's recipes 
may be varied, and any kind of beans or peas used to 



96 The Food Question 

make it. Served with a good gravy, it makes a sub- 
stantial dish for dinner. 

By using a choux paste, left-over rice, macaroni, spa- 
ghetti, any kind of beans, peas, or lentils may be made 
into patties or croquettes. They may be served with 
gravy or jelly, and their original form scarcely be recog- 
nized when they appear on the table next time. 

To make the choux paste, take one and one half table- 
spoons of butter, dairy or vegetable, one tablespoon of 
chopped onion, and a pinch of sage. Put in a small sauce- 
pan, and stir over the fire a few minutes, but do not 
brown. Add three tablespoons of flour, and stir until it 
is thoroughly scalded. Then add one third cup of milk, 
and stir until smooth. Drop into this mixture the yolk 
of one egg, and stir until it is well cooked. It should be 
a thick, smooth paste when done. Part of this may be 
used one day, and the rest saved for another time. 

As the housewife seeks to make use of all remnants 
of food, new possibilities will gradually open before her, 
and her efforts will become a real pleasure rather than a 
task.
