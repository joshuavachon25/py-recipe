Si 

II ROMETHEUS stole fire from the Celestials, so the tra- 
dition tells us, and brought it down to mortals. He has 
long had the credit of doing it because of the great pity 
■'fO he felt for the wretched condition of primitive men, who, in 
y;\. utter savagery, devoured their grains, flesh and fish in the 
natural way, unconverted into grateful dishes by the pro- 
cesses of roasting, baking or boiling. 

But it is time for this memorable conceit, so complimentary to 
Prometheus, and very likely originated by him for the sake of 
effect, to be thoroughly exploded, Jupiter saw through the trick at 
the time, as is clear from the rough way in which he handled the 
thief. 

The undoubted fact is that the sly old fellow was looking out 
for himself and his own enjoyment in the whole transaction, car- 
ing no more for man than demagogues care for the "dear people." 
He, like other inhabitants of Olympus, was much in the habit of 
walking to and fro in the earth and taking a place in human feasts. 
At the festivals of the gods, which were very near together and 
lasted a long time, there was always a grand display of good cook- 
ing. The gods and goddesses of mythology were great epicures. 
Raw meats were not in favor with them, and the cultivated taste 
of Prometheus rebelled when he had set before him in mundane 
banquets, joints of pork, beef and mutton which had never pass- 
ed through the fire. 



VI ' PREFACE. 

Imagine a dainty feeder from the higher world, eating whole 
wheat without gravy, or tearing the uncooked flesh from a pheas- 
ant's breast to get at the wish-bone to break v/ith some comely 
daughter of Hellas! It was for the sake of providing more 
toothsome morsels for himself, when he should come down for 
further junketings with the brave men and fair women of Asia 
Minor and the ^gean Islands, that he stole the fire. The larceny 
was in the interest of the culinary art. Since the adv^ent of fire, 
cooking has been one of the industries and fine arts of the world. 
The great quest ion, "what shall we eat?" which has alvva^^s engaged 
the attention and stimulated the efforts of humanity, has hardly 
surpassed in interest or importance, that other question, "now 
shall we cook what we eat?" By what ingenious manipulations 
shall the many materials which enter into that generous compound 
known as "good living," be so combined that the best ends of 
taste and nourishment may be secured? It is not enough that the 
nutritive qualities of food be retained, while, in the cooking, all 
that can please the taste is driven off. So this question involves 
not only eating, but eating "with enjoyment. Good food must not 
be repulsive to the palate. There can be no more fruitful source 
of domestic discord than the perpetual appearance on the family 
table of unpalatable viands. Many a man has first begun to sus- 
pect that his wife was not his true affinity, when he has had his 
taste disgusted by ill-cooked meats, insipid soups and spoiled veg- 
etables. Sour bread is closely related to sour temper. 

A man of ancient Sybaris, a city noted for luxury, is said to 
have once tasted the black broth of the Lacedaemonians. He de- 
clared after it, that he could not wonder the Spartans were so 
brave in battle, for the reason that the pains of death, however 
dreadful, were as nothing when compared with the misery of liv- 
ing on such execrable food. 

The economic question, too, is of importance. People of lim- 
ited means must cook, and they must avoid excessive outlay. All 
the income cannot go to the filling and boiling of the pot. The 
burning down of a house to roast a pig, after the Chinese method, 
is too costly, in a country where houses are expensive. How then 



PREFACE. ' vn 

shall we cook so that we can afford to eat, becomes a topic for 
careful study. It is possible to prepare food that shall be like the 
savory meat of Isaac, full of nutriment and pleasant to the taste, 
from materials that cost but little. The strength of the ox is not 
all concentrated in choice roasts nor porter-house steaks. Some 
of the undiscovered possibilities of the culinary art lie in the di- 
rection of furnishing a good meal from the smallest quantity of 
inexpensive material, as well as in the other direction, of turning 
to its best account the very choicest of material. 

The man who can cook well and economically, and can teach 
the art, is a benefactor to his kind, and deserves a statue of brass, 
if not a canonization. 

The woman who can do it, holds the key of the home citadel. 
She commands the situation. Her husband rejoices in her, and 
her children, rosy, strong and fair, live, with good digestion, to 
bless her memory for her good cooking, as well as for her other 
virtues. 

Good cooking is a valuable ally of godliness. Dyspepsia is the 
stronghold of depravity. An abused and impaired stomach is but 
another name for the eclipse of faith. Pernicious moods, harm- 
ful introspections and horrible bug-bears of suspicion and doubt 
are the portion of him who has been so unfortunate as to damage 
his most important vital function by feeding on food spoiled for 
human uses, in the cooking, and made fit only for creatures with 
the digestive apparatus of the ostrich. 

This little book is an outgrowth from the experience of many 
who wait upon the domestic altars of our city. It gives the 
results of countless experiments in the direction of prudent 
wholesome, healthful, enjoyable cooking. It is hoped and be- 
lieved that it will give help in many ways to those who shall 
consult it, — that it will be the chart to guide many a young 
house-keeper serenely through the most dangerous passages 
of domestic life, — that it will be the "Open Sesame" to many 
a culinary mystery, — that it will check the growing tendency 
to seek divorce, by removing one of the causes of matrimonial 
infelicity; so, in all ways fulfilling the mission of a good book. 



VIII PREFACE. 

Milton well says, "As good almost kill a man as kill a good 
book; wlio kills a man kills a reasonable creature, God's image; 
but he who destroys a good book, kills reason itself." 

The ladies who have compiled this manual have thought it not 
best to include alcoholic condiments, believing it better to lack a 
certain piquancy in a few articles of food, than to bring to the 
home table anything which may so easily work mischief. 

The aim of the book will be realized if it shall become a minis- 
ter of help to many known and unknown patrons, to whom its 
compilers would say in the renowned classic of Jefferson, "May 
you live long and prosper." 



^oi;f>^. 



"^I^^l^ OUP may be made of any kind of fresh meat. Allow a 
^^Mp pound of uncooked meat to a quart of water. Bones 
f|i^cy^^ boiled with the meat are an improvement, as the marrow 
f .^nt, adds to the richness. The meat should be put into cold 
n\ ' water, without salt, and heated gradually — never allowing 
the water to boil hard, nor stop boiling. The kettle must 
be kept covered. Keep boiling water to renew with as it 
evaporates. Never fill in with cold water and do not season till 
nearly done. The bones and pieces left from a roast at dinner, 
may be made into soup the next day — a piece of raw meat may 
be added if necessary. The vessel in which the soup is to be boiled, 
should be perfectly sweet and clean. As the scum rises to the 
surface, skim with care, and, if it is slow in rising, a little cold 
water may be thrown in, to bring it up more speedily. Soup 
should be boiled from three to five hours, and never allowed to cool 
in the vessel in which it is made. If very rich, the oily substance 
should be skimmed from the top, as it is quite unwholesome. It 
is better to boil the soup the day before using, as the fat can be 
more easily removed after it has cooled. 

' Soup kept on hand ready made, is called stock. The supply may 
be kept good by saving and boiling such bones and pieces as are 
left on the platter from every day cookery. This should be strained 
before setting away. It is very convenient for making gravies, and 
adding to vegetable soups; and in winter may be kept a long time. 
In summer it needs to be made fresh frequently. 

PLAIN BEEF SOUP, 

MRS. J. P. FOSTER. 

Take a shank bone, wash nicely, and, after breaking it in sev- 
eral places, put it into a pot of cold water, without salt. Let it 



10 SOUPS. 

boil slowly, and take off the scum as it rises. When it has boiled 
half an hour, add one cup of pearl barley, and boil two and a half 
or three hours. Half an hour before taking it up, have three or 
four good sized potatoes pared and sliced an eighth of an inch 
thick, and put them in to boil.. Add salt and pepper to taste. 
If the soup is too rich, skim the fat from the top before putting 
on the table. 

COMMON MEAT SOUP. 

MRS. DR. UOFFMAN, BEARDSTOWN, ILL. 

Boil four pounds of beef in salt water until it is soft. Care 
must be taken to use enough water in the beginning, but if more 
is necessary never add cold, but boiling, water. (This is a rule 
with every kind of soup.) If the soup is too weak, take out the 
meat and boil it down. If a few roots, such as carrots, celeriac, 
etc., are added, it will make a very palatable soup. 

SAGO SOUP. 

MRS. DR. HOFFMAN, BEARDSTOAYN, ILL. 

Take of the beef broth as above, and add as much sago as is 
necessary, but do not make the soup too thick; boil it until the 
sago is done, then take the yolks of two eggs, beat them up with 
a little of the broth, then pour them into the- soup and let it come 
to a boil. 

EGG-BARLEY SOUP. 

MRS. DR. HOFFMAN, BEARDSTOWN, ILL. 

Take three dry rolls, grate them, beat two eggs into them, stir 
well together, and pour slowly into the boiling meat soup, stirring 
continually. It will have the appearance of barley. After boil- 
ing a short time, serve with a little grated nutmeg. 

A GOOD VEGETABLE SOUP. 
Different kinds of vegetables, such as carrots, turnips, etc., are 
cut into small pieces and boiled soft in meat soup. Then take a 
head of Savoy cabbage; clean, cut it into quarters, boil soft in 
water, press it out or drain the water off, then put into the soup. 
Brown meat soup is best. When all is sufficiently soft, pour as 
much soup over it as is necessary to make the desired quantity; 



SOUPS. 11 

toast slices of fine white bread or stale rolls, and put into it. 
Before serving, grate nutmeg over it. 

O^ULIFLOWER SOUR 

MRS. DR. HOFFMAN, BEARDSTOWN, ILL. 

Pick all the little green leaves from the cauliflower, and put it 
into boiling water; after a minute or two the water should be 
poured off, meat soup poured^n, and boiled together with pars- 
ley and carrots, in a tightly covered pot, until nearly soft. Sprin- 
kle a spoonful of flour over it, shaking the pot, but not stirring it, 
as that will break the cauliflower, which should be avoided, Pour 
as much more meat soup over it as is desired, and boil until all is 
soft. "When ready to serve, take the 3^0] ks of tv/o or three eggs, 
beat them well in the soup tureen, and pour the soup slowly over 
them, stirring continually. Small pieces of white bread, fried in 
butter, may be added just before serving. 

AN EXCELLENT SOUP WITHOUT MEAT. 

Peel and slice six onions, six potatoes, six carrots, and four tur- 
nips; ; fry them in a half a pound of butter, and pour on four quarts 
of boiling water. Toast a crust of bread as brown and hard as 
possible, but do not burn it, and put it in with some celery, sweet 
herbs, pepper and salt; stew it all gently for four hours, and 
strain through a coarse cloth. If desired, an anchovy and a spoon- 
ful of catsup may be used. 

TOMATO SOUP. 

MRS. DR. HOFFMAK, BEARDSTOWK, ILL. 

Take beef broth and add tomatoes to suit the taste, (having pre- 
viously cooked, mashed, and strained them very fine), a little pep- 
per, sugar, and two tablespoonfuls of flour, or pulverized crackers. 
Boil ten minutes and then serve. 

TOMATO SOUP. 

MISS LIZZIE SMITH, MT. CARROLL, ILL. 

Take six peeled tomatoes of medium size, with one pint of water, 
cook thoroughly, season with butter, pepper and salt. At the 
last, add one quart of sweet milk, let it come to a boil, and take it 
up at once, or the milk will curdle. 



12 SOUPS. 

POTATO SOUP. 

MRS. J. KUHN. 

Peel four or five good sized potatoes, and boil in two quarts of 
water. When boiled soft, pour off the water, mash the potatoes 
fine and return them to the water. Take a piece of butter about 
the size of an Qg^., fry it with two tablespoonfuls of flour (and, if 
desired, an onion), till brown. Then add it to the soup, with salt 
and pepper to taste. 

POTATO SOUP. 

MISS W. JOHNSON. 

Peel and slice three potatoes; boil them in two quarts of water 
till nearly done, then add one teacup of milk. Pepper, salt and 
butter to taste. Just before removing from the fire, pour in one 
cup of sweet cream. 

BEAN SOUP. 

MISS W. JOHNSON. 

Soak one pint of beans in cold water over night. Boil till ten- 
der, then mash and strain them through a colander. Boil them 
up in two quarts of meat broth, and season to taste. 

BEAN SOUP. 

MRS. C. C. HOWELL. 

After breakfast, put one coffee-cup of beans into four quarts of 
water, with the trimmings from your breakfast steak, or other bits 
of meat. Let it boil constantly until dinner, adding water if nec- 
essary. Season with salt and pepper, and when done, strain into 
the soup tureen through a colander, and you have a delicious soup 
with very little expense. 

PEA SOUP. 

MRS. G. F 



If dry peas are used, soak them over night in a warm place, 
using a quart of water to each quart of the peas. Early next 
morning, boil them an hour, putting in a teaspoonful of soda, a few 
minutes before removing them from the fire. Take them up, put 
them into fresh water, and boil them until tender (3 or 4 hours); 



SOUPS. 13 

boil with them a pound of salt pork; it should be taken upas soon 
as tender. Other meat can be used if preferred, and the soup 
seasoned to taste. Green peas need no soaking, and only an hour's 
boiling. 

GREEN PEA SOUP. 

Mix two quarts of green peas with a quarter of a pound of lean 
ham, cut into small dice; put into a stew pan, add a cup of cold 
water, and place over a sharp fire, stirring the contents occasionally ; 
when very tender, add two tablespoonfuls of flour, which mix well 
in, mashing the peas with your spoon against the sides of your stew 
pan. Add two quarts of stock (meat broth), a tablespoonful of 
sugar, and a little pepper and salt. Boil all well together five min- 
utes. Strain and serve. 

GREEN CORN SOUP. 

MKS. W. H. CLEGHORN. 

Take one dozen ears of green corn, and shave the corn from the 
cobs. Put the cobs into a gallon of cold water, and boil 30 min- 
utes, after which remove them and skim the water thoroughly. 
Chop or bruise the corn, and boil it 30 minutes in the same water. 
Then add two quarts of fresh milk, and season with butter, pep- 
per and salt to taste. Let it boil up and serve. 

GREEN PEA SOUP. 
Shell the peas, and boil the pods and peas in separate vessels. 
If you have no stock (meat broth), add a little fresh meat, or a slice 
of ham to the water in which the pods are boiled. "When the pods 
are thoroughly boiled strain the water through a colander; return 
the liquor to the pot, and add the peas a quarter of an hour before 
serving. Butter and season to suit the taste. Pour over crackers 
if desired. t 

OYSTER SOUP. 

MRS. J. P. FOSTER. 

• 

To one quart of sweet milk and one pint of boiling water, add 
the liquor from one quart of oysters. Boil this up together, then 
add the oysters and half a teacupful of cracker crumbs rolled 
fine. Add butter, salt and pepper to taste. Much boiling hard- 
ens the oysters. Serve with hot toast and crackers. 



14 SOUPS. 

CHICKEN SOUP. 

Old fowls are best for making soup. Cut up as for frying; boil 
gently in three quarts of water till the meat is well cooked; skim 
carefully. Add a teacupful of rice, and season to taste. Some 
prefer to add sweet milk or cream. Pick the meat carefully from 
the bones and serve with the soup, or make into salad. 

CHICKEN AND OYSTER SOUP. 

Cut up a full-grown fowl as for frying. Clean the giblets nicely, 
and put all in the soup kettle, with just enough water to cover 
them; let it simmer gently; remove all the scum. When the 
chicken is tender, take it up, strain the liquor, and return it to the 
kettle. Use a quart of sweet milk to a quart of broth; add boiling 
water if necessary. Add a quart of oysters with their juice, and 
two or three blades of mace, a tablespoonful of butter, one of 
wheat flour rubbed into the butter, and one gill of hot cream; stew 
gently five minutes. Cream must always be boiled before being 
put into soup or gravy. Use the chicken for salad. 

MOCK TURTLE SOUP. 

Take the head and two feet, of a calf, that have been carefully 
cleaned. Separate the jaws and remove the brains. Place the 
meat in cold water, let it heat slowly, and skim with care. When it 
is done, take it up, and set it away until the next day. Then skim 
off the fat, pick the meat from the bones, and chop fine; put the 
liquor and /jar^ of the meat in the pot. Tie, in a thin muslin 
cloth, a few grains of allspice, bruised slightly, and a dozen cloves; 
add to the soup, also, a grated nutmeg; this is spice enough for 
half a gallon of soup. Salt and pepper to taste. Stir frequently 
to prevent the meat from burning. Half an hour before the soup 
is done, one tablespoonful of batter, made with water and browned 
flour, should be added for each gallon; force-meat balls may also 
be added, if desired. Fifteen minutes before sending to the table, 
add half a gill of good catsup to each quart of soup. To each 
gallon, add two tablespoonfuls of lemon juice. The yolks of eight 
hard-boiled eggs, sliced, should be put into the soup after it is 
poured into the tureen. This soup may be made equally good 
with a shank of veal or beef. A little butter and cooked Irish 



SOUPS. 15 

potatoes added to the remaining meat and laid in pie-crust, make 
a good mock turtle pie. 

FORCE-MEAT BALLS. 
Chop half a pound of lean veal, or other meat, fine, together 
with a little raw salt pork; add a small tea-cup of bread crumbs, 
moistened with cream. Season with salt, pepper, curry powder 
or cloves. Work all together with a well-beaten egg. If the 
paste is too stiff, add another egg., or only the yolk, or a little more 
cream. If not stiff enough, they will fall to pieces. Make into 
balls, the size of half an egg and boil part in the soup, fifteen 
minutes. Fry the remainder in hot lard and serve up in a sepa- 
rate dish. 

NOODLE SOUP. 

MRS. J. KUHN. 

Take two eggs and flour enough to make very stiff, and roll out 
as thin as possible. Let it dry a little, then turn in one edge and 
make it in a long roll. Cut slices across this as thin as can be 
done with a sharp knife. Put them into plain beef soup just long 
enough before serving, to have them come to a boil — a longer time 
will make them heavy. 

DUMPLINGS FOR SOUP. 

MRS. J. B. LYMAN, ROCKPORD, ILL. 

One-half pint of sweet milk, two tablespoonfuls of butter; when 
scalding hot, stir in flour until stiff; three eggs. 

SCOTCH BROTH. 

Take the chops from a neck of mutton ; cut the remainder into 
small pieces and let it stew gently the Avhole day. Boil a quarter 
of a pint of pearl barley in a little water, till tender ; strain it 
dry. Chop fine two large onions and turnips and put with the 
barley and meat into a close stew-pan; strain the broth into it, 
also the water from the barley; let it boil one hour and a half and 
skim well. Season it only with salt and pepper. 

PORTABLE SOUP. 

Take the liquor in which beef or veal, or any scraps of fresh 
meat, good bones, or fowls, have been boiled. Remove all the 



16 SOUPS. 

fat and strain the liquor into the stew pan ; boil briskly, putting 
in salt to taste and plenty of pepper. Leave the stew-pan un- 
covered, and watch closely to prevent burning. Drop a little 
upon a cold plate and when of a consistency to make thick 
jelly, pour it on platters, having it not over three quarters of 
an inch in thickness. When cold, cut in pieces about three inches 
square and set them in the sun to dry, turning them frequently. 
When perfectly dry, put them in an earthen vessel with white 
paper between each layer. If the. directions are strictly fol- 
lowed these cakes will keep good a long time. 

OCHRA, OR GUMBO SOUP. 

MRS. G. E. OSGOOD. 

Cut up a chicken and a small piece of salt pork as if to fry; take 
two quarts of young and tender ochra, slice it, and put into a 
pot with the meat, with just cold water enough to cover it, 
and stew for an hour. Then add one quart of ripe tomatoes sliced, 
and two or more quarts of boiling water. Cover closely, and 
skim frequently. Boil till the meat and vegetables fall to pieces, 
then add butter, pepper and salt to taste; serve hot. This is a 
southern dish, but ochra is raised in this latitude. 



^im. 




ISH to be really good tnust be fresh. If the eyes are 
bright and the flesh firm, it is a pretty sure indication of 
- their freshness. 



TO FRY FISH. 

An iron spider is the best utensil for the purpose. The 
lard used for frying should be sweet and clean and free from 
salt. The lard should be just the right heat. If a small piece of 
bread thrown in fries crisp, the lard is ready; if the bread burns 
it is too hot. As soon as the fish is done, lay it on a soft cloth by 
the fire to absorb the grease. 

HOW TO BROIL FISH. 

When thoroughly cleaned and washed, dry the fish with a towel; 
rub it inside and outside with a little butter, and salt and pepper 
it on both sides. Have a sharp fire and the draught good, set on 
the fish and turn over often enough to prevent it from charring. 
It must broil quickly. When done, place the fish on a warm plat- 
ter, the inside up, and spread over butter. When turning the 
fish, do not use a knife and fork, but lay a dish on it and hold it 
with one hand, while you turn the gridiron over with the other. 
Lay the skin side down, first. 

TO BOIL FRESH FISH. 
After being well scaled and cleaned, rub salt over the 
inside of the fish; wrap each fish in a cloth and sew it on, then 
place in a kettle of warm water, salt the water, simmer gently till 
the fish will separate, but not fall from the bone. This may be 
ascertained by opening the cloth and trying it in one place, but 
fasten it up again if not done. Serve with rich drawn butter, 
with eggs. 

2 17 



18 FISH. 

TO BAKE FISH. 

The simplest way is very good. Spread little pieces of bread 
with butter; pepper and salt them and lay them inside the fish; 
take a needle and thread and sew it up; lay it into a dish and 
put a few thin slices of pork on it; sprinkle over salt and flour 
it well. Baste it with the liquor which cooks out of it. A fish 
weighing four pounds will cook in an hour. 

BAKED FISH. 

MRS. A. L. FEISBIE. 

Open the fish so that it will lie perfectly flat. Rub salt over it 
and lay it in a dripping pan, with a very little butter and water. 
Put it in a very hot oven and bake twenty minutes or a half hour, 
according to thickness of the fish. When done it will be a deli- 
cate brown and will be cooked through without the trouble of 
turning. Of course the skin side is laid next the dripping pan. 
White fish cooked in this way are especially nice. 

FISH CHOWDER. 

MRS. J. B. STEWART. 

Take three or four pounds of fish for six or eight persons; cut 
in sections, crosswise. Take five or six slices of salt pork, lay 
them in the bottom of the kettle and let them fry slowly until all 
the fat is fried out; then remove the scraps of pork and lay in 
about one-third of the fish, then a layer of potatoes, then a 
sprinkling of chopped onions (chop two onions for the whole,) 
then pepper and salt and some flour dredged in so as not to lump. 
Place in layers until the whole is used. Cover with cold water 
and boil fifteen minutes, then add a half dozen Boston crackers, 
split and wet in cold water; add one pint of sweet milk. Bdil 
five minutes more and serve. 

TO POT FRESH FISH. 

Let the fish lie in salt and water several hours. For five pounds 
of fish take three ounces of salt, two ounces of pepper, two of 
cinnamon, one of allspice, and half an ounce of cloves. Cut the 
fish in slices and lay in the jar in which it is to be cooked — a 
layer of fish, then sprinkle spices, with flour and bits of butter on 



FISH. 19 

top; another layer of fish and seasoning, till all is packed. Fill 
the jar with equal proportions of vinegar and water; lay on a 
cloth pressed down close to the sides of the jar, and put flour on 
top, so no steam may escape. Bake moderately six hours; let it 
remain in the jar till cold, when it can be sliced for tea. 

SHAD. 

Fresh shad are good baked or broiled, but much the best 
broiled. For broiling, sprinkle salt and pepper on the inside 
when cleaned, and let it remain some hours. Salt shad for broil- 
ing should be soaked ten or twelve hours, in cold water. For 
boiling, they need be soaked only long enough to enable the scales 
to be easily removed. The roe is good either broiled or fried. 

BAKED HALIBUT. 

Lay five or six pounds of fresh halibut iu salt and water for two 
hours, then wipe dry, score the skin in squares, and set in a 
tolerably hot oven; baste quite often with butter melted in hot 
water. When done, a fork will easily penetrate it. Serve with 
drawn butter, flavored with walnut catsup, or such sauce as may 
be preferred. 

HALIBUT 
Is nice cut in slices, well seasoned, then broiled or fried. The 
fins and thick part are good boiled. 

SMOKED HALIBUT. 

MRS. E. P. CHASE. 

Enough may be soaked for several days at one time, hang it 
up to dry, and broil what is needed on a gridiron; when done, 
butter well, and serve while hot. 

SALMON TROUT, 

When thoroughly cleaned and washed, should be wiped care- 
fully and laid into a dripping pan, with water enough to prevent 
scorching. Bake slowly, basting often with butter and water. 
W^hen done, have ready a cup of sweet cream, diluted with a few- 
spoonfuls of hot water, stir in carefully two tablespoonfuls of 
melted butter, and a little chopped parsley. Heat this by placing 



20 FISH. 

the vessel in boiling water; add the gravy from the fish and boil up 
once. Place the fish in a hot dish and pour over the sauce. 
Pickerel are good baked in the same way. 

HOW TO CHOOSE A SALT MACKEREL. 

A poor mackerel when salted has a heavy dead appearing eye, 
but a fat one will have a substance which resembles white jelly, 
sometimes covering the eye and extending back from it on the 
head. All salt mackerel have it to some extent, and the larger 
the accumulation of this substance, the fatter and better the fisn. 
In soaking fish, use plenty of water, and put the skin side upper- 
most, as the salt will then fall to the bottom and leave the fish 
freshened. If it is very salt, the water may need to be changed. 
The fish will broil nicer to be hung up an hour or two to dry, 
before cooking, though wiping with a soft dry cloth will answer 
very well. 

BOILED MACKEREL. 

If fresh, simmer them fifteen minutes in a little water with 
salt. Do not let them boil hard. If salted, let them lie in hot 
water half an hour before boiling, then change the water. 

SOUSED MACKEREL. 

If fresh, when cleaned, boil them in salt and water. If salt, 
freshen them a little first. When boiled, take them out of the 
water, and save about half enough to cover them; mix it with an 
equal quantity of vinegar. Heat it scalding hot, wit,h a few pep- 
per-corns and cloves, and pour it over the fish. They will be 
sufficiently pickled in the course of three days. 

CANNED SALMON. 

MRS. G. E. OSGOOD. 

Set the can of salmon in a kettle of boiling water, let it stand 
half an hour, take it out, pour off the juice or oil from the salmon 
and pour over it a dressing made of equal quantities of butter and 
vinegar, boiled together. 

TO BROIL SMOKED SALMON. 
Wash well in cold water and wipe dry; cut in pieces to serve 



FISH. 21 

and broil on a hot gridiron, turning several times. When well 
heated through, take up, and put on melted butter. 

HOW TO COOK COD-FISH. 

Soak the thickest part for two days in sweet skimmed-milk, 
changing the milk twice. Roll in flour, and fry quite brown. 
Scald, but do not boil, a teacup of thick sweet cream, and pour 
over the fish. 

TO PREPARE COD-FISH FOR THE TABLE. 

MRS. J. M. OTIS. 

Remove the skin and bones. Make the fish fine by cutting it 
first in short pieces, then pick very fine. Throw into cold water 
for ten or fifteen minutes, letting it stand in a warm place. Pre- 
pare cream as for dried-beef. When it boils, add the fish skimmed 
from the water, and serve. 

BOILED COD-FISH. 

MRS. E. P. CHASE. 

Soak over night; put in a pan filled with water, and simmer 
two or three hours. Serve with drawn butter, with hard-boiled 
eggs sliced in it. 

DRAWN BUTTER. 

Half a cup of butter, large tablespoon of flour rubbed with 
the butter. Pour on one pint of boiling water. Salt to taste. 

COD-FISH BALLS. 

MES. E. P. CUASE. 

Take mashed potatoes, and half as much cod-fish as potatoes; 
add apiece of butter and one hard-boiled egg. Mash well together, 
and make in balls. Fry brown in equal parts of butter and 
lard. 

COD-FISH ON TOAST. 

MRS. J. P. FOSTER. 

Pull the fish into small strips, and soak about half an hour in 
luke-warm water; drain ofl^ the water, and pour on milk; add 



22 SHELLFISH. 

butter. Three or four beateu eggs improve it. Let it heat, but 
do not let it boil or it will harden. Turn it on buttered toast. 

FRIED FRESH COD-FISH. 

Cut the fish into slices about two inches thick, dip in egg, then 
in bread crumbs, and fry to a rich brown in plenty of fat.' 

Cod-fish is good baked after being boiled, and dressed with a 
rich sauce of cream, butter and hard-boiled eggs; rub a little 
flour into the butter. Garnish with parsley. 

BROILED COD-FISH. / 

MRS. E. P. CHASE. 

Soak till freshened enough, which can be determined by tast- 
ing; wipe dr}', and broil on gridiron. Do not forget to grease 
the bars. This makes a nice relish for tea.

OYSTER PIE. 

AKE a nice paste, and line a deep dish, turn a tea-cup 
down in the center; this will draw the liquor under it 
'1^ and prevent it from boiling over; it also keejDS the 
upper crust from falling in and becoming clammy. Lay 
in the oysters, with a little salt, pepper, butter and flour. 
Use but little of the liquor. Make a wide incision in the 
upper crust, so that when the pie is nearly done you can 
pour in half a tea-cup of sweet cream or milk. Secure the 
edges by moistening the under crust, and sprinkling flour on it 
before pinching down the top; place in the oven immediately 
and bake an hour. If allowed to stand, the under crust will be 
clammy. 




SHELL-FISH. 23 

OYSTER PATTIES. 

Take a pint of oysters, season with salt and pepper to taste, put 
into a stew pan, with a large tablespoonful of fresh butter; set 
this on the stove, and, as the butter melts, stir carefully; 
scald the liquor by itself, and when the butter is hot, but not 
boiling, pour the oyster liquor in, stir all together, and let it stew 
fifteen minutes; set this aside in an earthen vessel. Have patty 
pans lined with puif paste; bake them a light brown color; just 
before serving, fill these with oysters. They should be eaten imme- 
diately, as the gravy, by soaking in, will render the pastry heavy. 

ESCALLOPED OYSTERS. 

MRS. E. P. CHASE. 

Butter your pan or dish; cover the bottom with crackers, rolled 
fine. Add a layer of oysters. Alternate the crackers and oysters 
until you have three or four layers, the crackers being the top 
layer. Sprinkle each layer with salt and pepper and bits of butter. 
Moisten with a mixture of the oyster liquor and milk — butter on 
the top. Bake about three-quarters of an hour. 

PICKLED OYSTERS. 

MKS. D. O. FINCH. 

Drain the liquor from the oysters, scald and skim it till clear. 
Then scald the oysters in the liquor till they begin to shrivel. 
Skim them out; add vinegar and whole allspice to taste; let scald 
and pour over the oysters. 

TO FRY OYSTERS. 

MRS. C. W. NELSON. 

Take the largest oysters and spread them upon a napkin; put 
another over to dry them; then season with salt and pepper; 
have ready some beaten ^^'g^ and crackers rolled fine; prepare 
in your pan some sweet lard and butter. Dip each oyster into 
the egg, then roll in the cracker and drop into the boiling fat; 
there must be enough to allow the oysters to float. Serve with 
hot cakes. 



24 SHELL-FISH. 

STEAMED OYSTERS. 

MRS. C. H. SWEENEY. 

Wash the oysters, put them in a deep dish in the steamer, and 
let them cook till they shrivel. In the meantime have the liquor 
on the stove in a half pint of water; scald and skim, add one 
quart of milk' and butter; pepper and salt to taste; roll one 
cracker fine and sprinkle in and let all scald together; pour over 
the oysters, and serve immediately. 

FRIED OYSTERS. 
To fry, take fresh and good sized oysters, open and turn them 
into a colander for half an hour, to drain them. Beat two or three 
eggs in a bowl. Turn the oysters into fine cracker crumbs, and 
then shake them so that little of the crumbs shall adhere. Put the 
oysters into the beaten eggs, and stir them, after which, take 
them out one by one; see that they have been well dipped in the 
Q^'g., and roll them in bread or cracker crumbs. As soon as an 
oyster is well rolled in crumbs, put it into the palm of your 
hand, on its flat side, and press gently on it with the other hand. 
When thus prepared put them away in a cold place until they 
are put in the pan. They may be dipped in ^g^ and rolled a 
second time, half an hour after the first time. After being rolled 
in crumbs, they may be kept in a cold place for hours before being 
fried, but the quicker they are eaten after they are fried the bet- 
ter. When fried, turn them into a colander, dust fine salt over 
them and serve hot. 

BROILED OYSTERS. 

After being strained, they are rolled in fine cracker crumbs, 
then shaken gently on a rough towel, dipped in melted butter, 
rolled in bread or cracker crumbs, and broiled on the gridiron. 
Serve hot. 

STEWED OYSTERS. 

Put the oysters on the fire in a pan, with a little salt and butter; 
remove them at the first boil, add pepper and a little milk and 
cream, and serve. 



SHELLFISH. 35 

ROASTED OYSTERS. 
Put oysters, in the shell, on the gridiron or hot coals; when 
cooked, the shell usually opens a little; remove from the fire 
take off half the shell, put on butter, salt and pepper, and eat 
while hot. 

OYSTER FRITTERS. 
Scald them in their own liquor, and wipe dry. Add one pint of 
milk to the liquor, a teaspoonful of salt, and five well-beaten eggs, 
with flour enough to make a thin batter, and drop the oysters into it. 
Take up each oyster in a spoonful of batter, and fry in boiling 
lard, till a light brown. Lay a soft napkin on a flat dish, and serve 
the fritters on this, that the grease may be absorbed by it, and not 
soak into them. 

ANOTHER OYSTER PIE. 
Line a deep baking dish with rich puff paste, as for any other 
pie; fill with crackers or crusts of light bread. Have the top 
crust much thicker than the under one, and butter the edges so 
the crust will part easily when done. Put a roll of paste around 
the edge of the top crust, and bake. Drain the liquor from the 
oysters, put in a little hot water, salt and pepper, and set over 
the fire; when it comes to a boil, add a cupful of rich milk or 
cream; when it boils up once, put in the oysters, and stew five 
minutes; add a piece of butter, stir, and remove from the fire 
as soon as it melts. Time your work so that the crust shall be ready 
just as soon as the oysters are. Lift the top crust, pour in the 
hot oysters, and serve immediately. 

CLAM FRITTERS. 

Chop a dozen clams fine; take the liquor from the clams, and 
add one pint of milk; to this add four beaten eggs, and flour 
enough to make a thin batter. Season to taste. Fry in hot lard. 

LOBSTER CROQUETTES. 

Take boiled lobster and chop fine, season to taste, and have fine 
bread crumbs about one-third of the quantity of meat, and mix with 
two tablespoonfuls of melted butter. Make this into balls, roll in 
beaten q^^.^ then in fine bread crumbs, and fry in hot lard. Serve 
immediately.

TO SELECT AND PREPAEE POULTRY. 



RY the wing, and if it is easily disjointed or turned back, 
the fowl is young; if a turkey, it has also a smooth leg 
and soft bill, and if fresh, the eyes will be bright and 
' the feet moist. If the fowls are dressed, select by their 
'skin and breast bone. The young ones have a thin and ten- 
der skin, and the breast bone yields readily when pressed by 
the fingers. (They should be killed by having the neck cut, and 
then hung by the legs so that they will bleed freely, in order to 
make them white and healthy to eat.) Scald and pick off the 
feathers, being careful to remove all the pin-feathers. A pair of 
tweezers or the point of a dull knife is frequently a great 
help. Cut the oil-bag out from above the tail, and singe off 
the hair by holding over a blazing paper, so the fire may reach 
all parts. Then remove everything from the inside, keeping 
the gizzard, heart and liver to stew for the gravy. Great care 
must be used in separating the gall-bag from the liver — if broken 
it renders what it touches unfit to eat. Thoroughly wash and 
cleanse the fowl. A little soda may be thrown into the water 
after the first washing, and then rinse in clear water. Cut off 
the legs at the first joint above the feet, and if to be cut up, 
the following way is advised, as each piece has a good portion 
of meat. Cut it open right through the back and so clear 
through the breast bone, being careful to leave the breast «iqual 
on both halves; then, after removing the flyer of the wings and 
the drumsticks, cut each half crosswise into four, five, or six 
pieces, according to the size of the fowl, being careful so to cut 
as to leave good meat on each piece,

28 POULTRY. 

TO ROAST A TURKEY. 

MRS. J. P. POSTER, 

Prepare according to directions given above. Make a dressing 
of fine bread crumbs, season with salt and pepper and add sage or 
such sweet herbs as are preferred. Do not flavor too strongly with 
any one thing; mix all together and pour over melted butter to 
moisten it nearly enough, then add a little water. Put salt on 
the inside of the turkey, and fill the crop and body with the 
dressing; sew it up with white woolen yarn (for it will not tear 
the flesh as cotton does), tie the legs and wings close to the body, 
lay into a dripping-pan, and rub a little salt and butter over it, 
or lay on two or three slices of salt pork; pour over a tea-cup of 
water, and place it in the oven. It should be roasted slowly at 
first, and basted frequently. If desired, oysters can be used in 
the dressing and sauce. Mix the oysters with the bread, omitting 
the herbs, and moisten with the liquor of the oyster instead of 
water. 

For the gravy, boil the heart, liver and gizzard, till very tender; 
then chop fine and return to the water in which they were 
boiled; add oysters and their liquor, also some butter rubbed in 
flour to thicken the gravy, and season to taste; boil till oysters and 
flour are cooked, then serve. 

BOILED TURKEY. 

Prepare as for roasting. Half a ciip of rice boiled with a turkey 
makes the meat look white, or wrapping it closely in a cloth 
dredged with flour before putting it to boil will have the same 
efi"ect. A small piece of salt pork improves the flavor. Oyster 
sauce is very nice for turkey cooked in this way. 

TO WARM OVER TURKEY. 

Pick the meat from the bones, and chop fine; spread a layer 
of crackers or bread crumbs in the bottom of a buttered dish; 
moisten with a little milk or water, then put on a layer of turkey, 
(a little cooked ham minced fine and mixed with it is an im- 
provement,) a few bits of butter and the dressing, then another 
layer of crumbs and so on till near the top, seasoning to taste all 
the way through, and pouring on the gravy left from the day 



POULTRY. 29 

before, adding water if necessary. The top layer should be 
crumbs soaked in warm milk and beaten up light with two eggs 
and spread smoothly over, with bits of butter on the top. Turn a 
pan or deep plate over this till cooked through, and then remove 
the cover and let the top brown. 

OTHER WAYS. 

Cut the pieces that are left, up fine, and warm with the 
gravy, or make a turkey pie of them. 

ROAST CHICKEN. 

Having picked and prepared the chicken for cooking, make a 
stuffing as for a turkey. Rub salt over it and place in dripping- 
pan with pieces of butter laid on the breast ; put in hot water 
enough to cover the bottom of the pan, and baste frequently, 
turning the pan so the chicken may roast equally on all sides. 
When done, take up the chicken and make a gravy by mixing 
flour with butter, or, if preferred, the fat of the drippings, and 
adding the giblets, pre\iously boiled and chopped, to the liquor 
in the dripping-pan. Boil up and serve. 

FRICASSEED CHICKEN. 

MES. J. P. POSTER. 

The chickens should be cut up according to previous directions; 
wash and lay in cold salt water for half an hour; put in a pot with 
the skin side down, with a few slices of salt pork; sprinkle in 
pepper, and put on just enough water to cover them (hot, not 
boiling water, is best). Cover and stew slowly till tender, then 
remove the chicken, and skim the oil from the top of the liquor, if 
the chickens are fat; take a piece of butter and mix with flour 
enough to thicken the remainder. Boil till the flour is cooked. 
Have ready some hot shortcakes or biscuits, split open, and laid 
on your platter, or toast if preferred. Lay on your chicken and 
pour gravy over the whole. If the pork does not salt it suffi- 
ciently, add salt before taking up the chicken. Old fowls are 
best cooked in this way. 

BROILED CHICKEN. 

MRS. J. M. OTIS. 

Cut the chicken into desirable pieces for the table; put it into 



30 POULTRY. 

a stewpan with water sufficient to keep it from scorching, and a 
very little salt; when it is dry, place the pieces upon a hot, but- 
tered gridiron, over coals; turn frequently to prevent scorching; 
when done butter and season to the taste. Chicken prepared in 
this way is tender and juicy. 

BROILED CHICKEN. 

None but young and tender chickens should be broiled. They 
should be split down the back, and, after a thorough washing, be 
wiped dry. Place the chicken, inside downward, on a buttered grid- 
iron. The fire should be clear and bright, with no smoke; cover with 
a deep plate or pan, and broil till cooked through, turning several 
times to prevent charring. When done, lay on a heated platter, 
put on plenty of sweet butter, and season to taste — serving imme- 
diately. 

TO FRY CHICKEN. 

MRS. TURNER. 

Season the chicken with salt and pepper, before rolling in flour; 
have hot, equal proportions of lard and butter, jn sufficient quan- 
tity to cover it well; let it fry slowly and be sure not to let it burn; 
when done, take it out, and if gravy is desired pour in a little water 
or milk, and thicken with flour or corn starch. 

SMOTHERED CHICKEN. 

MRS. E. S. SPEED, RUSHVILLE, ILL. 

Split up the back, and wash thoroughly in two or three waters; 
^ut into a pan to bake, and salt it well; add a little pepper if 
desired; lay a lump of butter on the breast, pour a little water in 
the pan; a very small piece of red pepper is an improvement. If 
the chicken is young, cook in a very quick oven till well browned; 
baste often. 

CHICKEN PIE. 

MRS. J. P. FOSTER. 

Clean and cut the chickens in pieces ready to serve. Boil them 
in water barely to cover them till cooked nearly enough for the 
table; skim the water carefully. Some remove the skin if it is 
very thick. Line a deep dish with a thick paste made like soda 
or baking powder biscuit, only a little richer; place the pieces of 



POULTRY. 31 

chicken in layers; such as have bones in them should be laid from 
the center to the edge, to make carving more easy. Put in the 
hearts and livers, sprinkle each layer with flour, salt and pepper, 
lay over it a thin slice of salt pork, or a small piece of butter, put- 
ting rather more seasoning on the top layer, and pour over all as 
much of the liquor in which the chickens were boiled as the dish 
will hold without danger of boiling over. Roll the upper 
crust twice as thick as for fruit pies, make ai] incision for the steam 
to pass out, and lay it over the dish, first wetting the under crust 
with water, so the edge will be closed tightly. Bake in a quick 
oven till done. 

CHICKEN PUDDING. 
Cut up as for fricassee, and stew slowly in a little water; season 
well with salt, pepper and butter, unless there is salt pork with it; 
in about an hour take out the chickens to cool; save the water in 
which they Avere stewed, for gravy. Take three cups of flour, a 
little salt, three tablespoonfuls of melted butter, four well beaten 
eggs and a quart of milk; mix together with two tablespoonfuls of 
baking powder; put a layer of chicken in the bottom of a baking 
dish and pour over enough batter to cover the meat, alternate the 
layers of chicken and batter till the dish is full; let the batter be 
on the top to form the crust. Bake moderately till done through, 
and the crust a light brown. 

JELLIED CHICKEN. 

MRS. C. BOWElSr. 

Boil the chicken, till thoroughly done, seasoning with butter, 
pepper and salt. Then take out and remove all bones and skin, 
leaving nearly one quart of liquor in the kettle. For one chicken 
dissolve one half box of Coxe's gelatine in one cup of hot water 
and pour into the liquor with the chicken; cook a few minutes, 
then turn into molds and set away to cool. Do not pick the 
chicken into ver^'^ fine pieces; it cuts and looks much rjicer if left in 
large pieces. Slice with a sharp knife, and you have a handsome 
and most palatable dish for your table. 

TO MAKE AN OLD FOWL TENDER. 

Put one tablespoonful of lemon juice into the water in which it 
is boiled. Strong vinegar may be used but is not so good. Citric 
acid is a better substitute — a lump the size of a large pea. 



32 POULTRY. 

A DRESSING FOR CHICKEN. 

MRS. E. S. SPEED, RTJSHVILLE, ILLS. 

Take as much bread as needed, crumb it very fine, season with 
salt, pepper and sage, to suit the taste; butter the size of an egg, 
and a- tablespoonful of water; boil two eggs hard, chop fine and 
mix with bread. 

TO DRESS A PRAIRIE CHICKEN. 
Lay the chicken on its back, head towards you; with a sharp 
knife cut the skin through on the breast bone; with the hands pull 
the skin apart down from off the breast and back, to the point of 
the breast bone, then cut the meat and ribs off from the back 
bone by running the knife from the point of the breast bone for- 
ward to the wing joints on both sides, and take off the entire 
breast, then take out each leg by skinning it and unjointing it from 
the body. The breast and legs of a prairie chicken are all that 
it is profitable to cook. 

TO FRY PRAIRIE CHICKEN. 

MRS, J. P. FOSTER. 

Take the legs and breast of a young prairie chicken, let them 
lie in cold salt and water an hour, or better still, with salt and pep- 
per sprinkled on them over night. Slice the breast in four pieces, 
roll it and the legs in flour, and lay in hot lard, cover tightly and 
set where it will steam till nearly done, then remove the cover, 
and fry a light brown. 

BROILED PRAIRIE-CHICKEN. 

Prepare the chicken as for frying, wipe dry and broil over 
hot coals; none but the most tender should be broiled, unless 
first steamed, or parboiled in very little water. 

STEWED PRAIRIE CHICKEN. 

MRS. J. PARMELEE. 

When chickens are too old to broil or fry, they are nice prepar- 
ed as follows: After dividing them, put in a pan with sufficient 
water to just cover them; slice in a good sized onion to about 
two chickens, a little salt and pepper. Let them stew very sloio- 
ly for four hours, never allowing them to boil. When done, thick- 
en the liquid with butter rubbed in flour. 



POULTRY. 33 

ROASTED QUAIL. 

MRS. J. PARMELEE. 

Pick and clean the quails, then use dressing as for turkey with 
addition of onion. Put in a dripping pan and bake three-quar- 
ters of an hour, basting frequently. They are nice cold, for tea 
or supper. 

TO ROAST PIGEONS. 
Pick out the pinfeathers, or if too many, pull oif the skin; clean 
the inside thoroughly; soak half an hour in considerable water 
to take out the blood ; boil half an hour, with a little salt in the 
water, and take oif the scum as fast as it rises; take them out, 
fiour well and place in a dripping pan; strain the water in which 
they were boiled and put part of it in the pan with a small piece 
of butter, and baste the pigeons; add pepper as you choose. 
Roast them nearly two hours. 

ROAST DUCK. 

Clean and wipe dry your duck; prepare the stuflBngthus: chop 
fine and throw into cold water three good sized onions, cut one 
large spoonful of sage leaves and mix with bread crumbs and a 
piece of butter the size of a walnut; drain the onions, and add 
with a little salt and pepper. Mix these together and stuiF the 
duck well; dredge and baste like a turkey. Ccok an ordinary 
sized duck over an hour. A nice gravy is made by straining the 
drippings; skim off all the fat, then stir in a spoonful of. browned 
flour and a teaspoon ful of mixed mustard. Serve hot. Currant 
jelly is necessary with duck. 

TO BOIL DUCK. 

MRS. S. MERRILL. 

Scald and lay them in water a few minutes, then lay them in a 
dish, pour boiling milk over them, and let them lie in it two or 
three minutes; take them out, dredge with flour and put them in 
a saucepan of cold water, cover close and boil twenty minutes; 
take them out, cover, and set where they will keep warm, and 
make the sauce as follows : chop a large onion and a bunch of 
parsley fine and put therein a gill of gravy; add a tablespoonful 
of lemon juice, a little salt, pepper, and a small piece of butter; 
stew them half an hour, then lay the ducks into a dish and pour 
the sauce over them.

SMOTHERED DUCK. 

MRS. J. ANKENEY. 

Pick and dress as turkey, and put in a pot with a pint of water; 
add salt, pepper and a piece of butter; tie a cloth on the pot, and 
cover air tight as nearly as possible. Stew slowly for four or five 
hours. 

ROAST WILD DUCK. 

MRS. J. P. f6sTER. 

Parboil in water with a little salt, placing an onion in each duck 
to absorb the fishy taste that some ducks have; if onion is not 
agreeable, a carrot is said to answer the same purpose. When 
boiled, take the duck and stuff as you would turkey, except that 
onion seems to be necessary. Roast till brown and tender, bast- 
ing with butter and water at first, then with the drippings. Make 
a gravy by taking off the superfluous fat and thickening with 
browned flour. 



MS^S^H. 



HE most desirable requisite to make the following re- 
ceipts good and practical, is good meat. There is no 



[[^^ ^ cook in the world who can broil a "chuck steak" into a 
kj^ sirloin, or roast old ox-beef into a tender "rib roast," or 
Y make a savory bit of mutton out of an old, tough sheep. 

' The cook may do much towards supplying the want of real 
goodness in the meat, by skillful labor, but to place on the table 
the choicest dishes, the best of meats are necessary. Every good 
cook should know how to select the best meats, instead of de- 
pending on the butcher. 

Beef, to be the best, should be from a young steer — killed at 
three to four years old — after having been fattened as quickly as 
possible, on good, rich food. THe quicker beef is fattened, the 
richer and more tender it is, and beef of this class has a bright, 
rich, red, juicy look, while poor beef looks dark, dry, acid a brown- 
ish red color. 

The best cuts for steaks are from the hind quarter, the loin 
being generally chosen as the best, but many prefer the round, 
because, while not so tender, it is more juicy. 

For roasting, rib cuts are the best, the bone being removed 
from the meat, it being skewered so that it comes on the table 
rolled. There is, however, a difference of taste and fancy as to 
removing the bones before cooking. Some real epicures think 
the bones give the meat a richness of flavor not attainable with- 
out them. 

The fore-shoulder furnishes nice pieces for stewing and boiling, 
and an experienced butcher will supply a few very eatable steaks 
from it. Corned beef usually comes from the fore-quarter, but 
butchers generally corn nearly every part which they fail to sell 
fresh. 

35 



36 MEATS. 



VEAL. 



The calf matures much more rapidly than the lamb and, if well 
fed and cared for, may be killed at five weeks old, though, in the 
great majority of cases, the veal improves very rapidly during the 
sixth and seventh weeks of the calf's age, and it will pay the 
owner to feed a calf during these two weeks. Calves are some- 
times killed at four weeks old, but the meat is soft, and too tender 

to either cook or eat, and is very unwholesome. 

» 

MUTTON. 

In selecting mutton, choose, as a rule, a medium sized sheep, or 
a small one. The flesh should have a clear, fresh hue, and the 
fat, especially around the kidneys, look fat, rich, and rather oily, 
and a clear white, not a dull whitish color, and not dry. For 
roasting, the loin is the choice cut; but the fore-shoulder, when 
properly boned, stuffed and basted, is very nice. The leg is for 
boiling, or chops. 

The age at which lambs furnish the best meat, extends from 
three to ten months, and at ten, most lambs become sufficiently 
developed to be called mutton. Like mutton, the hind-quarter is 
the best; but if the fore-quarter be prepared properly, it is rich 
and good, and many prefer it to the hind- quarter. 

CARE OF FAT MEAT AND DRIPPINGS. 

When meat has more fat than is desirable to cook with it, the 
fat should be trimmed off, such pieces as are nice should be cut 
small and put in a vessel with a little water, and stewed slowly 
till the fat is extracted and the water boiled out, then strained in 
a dish. Any surplus fat in the drippings of a roast may be add- 
ed also, and when meat is boiled, the fat that rises on the top 
should be saved. It is well to clarify all such fat by putting it 
into a kettle to melt slowly, stirring occasionally till it looks 
clear, then strain and set away for use. This saves butter, for it 
may be mixed in equal proportions with that or lard, for ginger 
cakes or pie crust. By some it is considered more healthy for 
frying doughnuts than lard. It needs careful watching to see 
that it does not grow stale; it is necessary to clarify it quite often 
in summer, but it will keep longer in winter; keep it in tin or good

solid stone jars that will not absorb tlie grease and grow rancid. 
Mutton is not good to put with other fat, being too hard and tallowy. 
All refuse grease should be saved for making soap. 

A FRENCH WAY OF COOKING MEATS 

MRS. HILL, MUSCATINE, lA. 

Any kind of a piece of meat, rubbed well with salt and pepper, 
and put into a covered tin pail, placed in a kettle of boiling 
water and cooked till done, will be found very juicy and tender. 
The water must be kept boiling all the time. A delicious gravy 
can be made from the juice of the meat. 

ROAST BEEF. 

To roast in a cooking stove, the fire must have careful attention 
lest the meat should burn. Lay it, well floured, and seasoned, into a 
dripping pan, with rather more than enough water to cover the 
bottom, turn the pan around often, that all parts may be equally 
roasted, and baste frequently. The oven should be quite hot when 
the beef is first put in that the outside may cook quickly and thus 
retain the juices. A large roast of 8 or 10 pounds is much better 
and more economical than a small one, even in a small family. 
The first day it can be served rare; that which is near the outside 
will be well enough cooked for any one. It can be re-roasted on 
the next day. If much remains serve cold on the next, or cut in 
very thin slices, dip each one in flour, then chop two onions fine, 
place a layer of meat in a baking dish and sprinkle it with salt 
pepper and onions; above this, place a layer of sliced or canned 
tomatoes; alternate the layers till the dish is nearly full, moisten- 
ing with the gravy; place a layer of tomatoes upon the top, fill 
with boiling water, cover with a plate, and bake two hours. 

ROAST BEEF. 

MRS. M. P. TURNER. 

A 10 pound roast is the nicest. Put it into a hot oven and let 
it crisp over, as soon as possible, to keep all the juice inside the 
meat. After the meat is well browned, put a little boiling water 
into the dripping pan, grease a paper, two or three thicknesses, and 
lay over the meat, then turn a dripping pan over all. 



38 MEATS, 

BEEF A r.A MODE. 

MRS. C. P. KEEVES. 

Take a tender, fresh round, take out the bone and with a sharp 
knife make many deep incisions, then wash and season well with 
pepper and salt. For the dressing, crumb the soft part of a ba- 
ker's loaf, to which add 1 teaspoonful of sweet marjoi'am, 1 of 
sweet basil, 2 small onions, mixed tine, 2 or 3 small blades of 
mace finely powdered; salt and pepper. Rub well together with 
six ounces of butter, fill the incisions, and tie tape around the meat 
to keep in place. Bake until well done. 

STEWED BRISKET OF BEEF. 

Put three or four pounds of brisket into a kettle and cover it 
with water; remove the scum as it rises, and let it boil steadily 
two hours; take it from the kettle and brown it with butter in a 
spider; when it is browned on every side, return it to the kettle 
and stew it gently five hours more; add more water if it boils 
away; pat in a few cloves, salt and pepper, as you' think neces- 
sary. Half an hour before dinner add tomato or mushroom 
catsup. The water in which it was stewed is a nice soup. 

STEWED BEEF. 

MRS. J. M. OTIS. 

The ends of the slices of "Porterhouse" steak are nice for 
stewing. In this case, have the thin part cut off before the meat 
is sliced. Cover the piece to stew with boiling water, and cook 
till every partis perfectly tender; season when two-thirds cooked. 
The water must be entirely cooked away to ratain the sweetness 
of the meat. " 

BROILED STEAK. ^ 

MRS. J. M. OTIS. 

Select your steak carefully. The wide end of the slice of 
"Porterhouse" is nice, or the "loin." Have the gridiron hot and 
' buttered, and over hot coals; place the beef upon the gridiron, 
and cook till the blood begins to start upon the upper side before 
turning, if the fire is not too hot. To retain the juice, beef 
should be cooked rapidly at first. Turn frequently rather than 



MEATS. 39 

scorch. When done, remove to the platter and season to the 
taste. Use no salt while cooking. This prevents the blood from 
escaping. 

BEEF STEAK ROLL. 

MRS. G. A. PRITCHARD. 

Select a nice, tender, sirloin steak; pound it well, season with salt 
and pepper; then make a nice dressing of chopped bread, well but- 
tered, salted and peppered, with a little sage, and mixed together 
with a very little warm water. Spread this on the meat, then 
begin at one end and roll it together; tie with strings. Put into 
a dripping-pan with a little water. Bake about tliree-quarters of 
an hour. To be eaten warm, or sliced cold for tea. 

BEEF STEAK AND ONIONS. 

Take thick beefsteak, (that which is not so tender will answer,) 
cut it in pieces ready to serve; put into a spider with a little hot 
water; slice up three or four onions, and stew very slowly several 
hours. Let the water boil out and the meat become brown, then 
stir flour into the fat which has come from the meat. If there is 
too much, take some out and pour on boiling water, and stir till 
the flour is cooked. Pour the meat and gravy into a deep dish or 
platter, and serve. 

Bay leaves, which can be obtained at the druggists, are a good 
substitute for those who do not like onions, but the leaves should 
be taken out before sending to the table. ^ 

TOMATO STEAK. 

MRS. S. MERRILL. 

Take two pounds of beef, cut it in small strips, and put it into 
a pot with seven medium sized tomatoes; stew it very slowly; 
add a dessert-spoonful of sugar, salt, a little clove, and, ju^ be- 
fore you take it up, a dessert-spoonful of butter. If you have 
tomato catsup, add a little, and, if you like, chopped onion. This 
is a good rule for cooking beef that is tough, as it renders it more 
palatable than most other ways. Some think this dish is better 
when heated over, the next day. 



40 MEATS. 

BEEFSTEAK FOR THE OLD. 

Take coarse, lean beef, with a small quantity of suet; run 
it through a sausage cutter, or chop very fine; add pepper 
and salt; make into cakes three quarters of an inch thick, and 
cook as you would beefsteak. The poor will find it cheap, and 
the rich, nearly as good as the choicest cuts. 

BEEF BALL. 

MISS LIZZIE SMITH. 

3 lbs. choice beef (rare) chopped fine, 10 butter crackers crush- 
ed thoroughly, ^ tea cup butter, pepper and salt to the taste, ^ 
cup water. Mix all well together, press down hard in pans, dip 
a few spoonfuls of the water in which the beef was boiled over the 
top and bake 1^ or 2 hours. Slice when cold. 

BEEF OMELET. 

MRS. W. H. CLEGHORN. 

One and one-half pounds of good beefsteak chopped fine, one 
cup suet, two slices of wheat bread soaked in water, two eggs 
and half a cup of sweet cream; season well with salt and pepper. 
Mold into a loaf or roll and bake three-fourths of an hour, basting 
frequently. 

SPICED BEEF. 

Chop tough beefsteak, raw, and a piece of suet the size of an 
egg; season with pepper, salt, and a little summer savory; add 
two eggs, half a pint of bread crumbs, four or five tablespoonfuls 
of cream, a small piece of butter; mix and make into a roll, with 
flour sufficient to keep together. Put in a pan with a little drip- 
pings and water, and bake as a roast. Slice thin when cold. 

TO BOIL CORNED BEEF. 

Wash it thoroughly and put into a pot that will hold plenty of 
water; the water should be cold; skim with great care; allow 
forty minutes for every pound after it has begun to boil. The 
goodness depends much on its being boiled gently and long. If 
it is to be eaten cold, lay it in a vessel which will admit of its 
being pressed with a heavy weight, as salt meat is very much 
improved by pressing. 



ME A TS. 41 

CORNED BEEF. 

MRS. M. E. KELLOGG. 

To have good corned beef, select a good piece of brisket or 
flank, and put it into a pot of boiling water; throw in a handful 
of salt, or enough to suit the taste, and boil till tender; then add 
potatoes, turnips and cabbage, with a piece of salt pork. This 
makes a good Yankee dinner, superior to beef pickled in brine. 

TO MAKE TOUGH BEEF TENDER. 

MES. CHAELES SWEENEY. 

Cut the steak, the day before using, into slices about two 
inches thick; rub over them a small quantity of carbonate of soda; 
wash off next morning; cut into suitable thickness; ccok to 
suit the taste. 

BOILED TONGUE. 

MES. J. B. STEWAET. 

Boil and skim; sprinkle some flour over it; put in cloves, and 
turn a cup of jelly over it. Bake moderately fifteen minutes. 

BAKED TONGUE. 

MES. M. E. KELLOGG. 

Season with common salt, a very little salt-petre, half a cup of 
brown sugar, pepper, cloves, mace and allspice, powdered fine. 
Let it remain for a fortnight, then take out the tongue, put it in 
a pan; lay on some butter; cover with bread crumbs, and bake 
slowly till so tender that a straw will easily go through it. To be 
eaten cold. Will keep a long time, and is very nice for tea. 

FRIED LIVER. 

Cut it in slices, and lay in cold salt water to draw out the blood. 
Some place it over a slow fire till the liver turns white. Take it 
out, roll each piece in flour or bread crumbs, season and put in 
hot lard. Cover, and cook slowly, till the liver is tender, then 
uncover and fry quickly till brown. Another way is to pour 
boiling water on the liver for a few moments, and proceed as 
above. 



42 MEATS. 

TO FRY TRIPE. 

MRS. A. Y. EAWSON. 

Cut in pieces convenient for serving; beat an egg lightly and 
dip each piece in the Qg^. Have your frying-pan hot and fry 
brown in butter. It will take a good deal of butter to make it 
nice and keep from burning. 

TO COOK DRIED BEEF. 

MRS. J. M. OTIS. 

Chip the beef as for the table; put it in a basin of cold water, 
and set it in a warm (not hot) place. Put a bowl of cream in a 
stew-pan over the fire, and when hot, shake in flour from the 
dredging-box, till it is, on boiling, of the consistency of thick 
cream; set off the stew-pan, and add to the thickened cream the 
beef which has been drained from the water, and it is ready for 
the table. The quantity of water used, and the length of time it 
is allowed to remain in the water, will necessarily depend upon 
the saltness of the beef. Fifteen minutes is usually sufficient. 

HOW TO FRY DRIED BEEF. 

MRS. T. HUNT. 

It is nice shaved off with a plane; then put it into a hot frying- 
pan, with butter to fry it until brown. Put in a tablespoonful of 
flour, then pour in hot water enough to make a gravy. Let it 
stew a moment before taking it up. 

TO WARM OVER COLD MEATS. 

MRS. S. MACY, NEWPORT, R. I. 

Take the pieces of cold steak or roast and put into a stew-pan, 
and nearly cover with water; slice in two or three onions; add 
butter, pepper and salt, and stew until very tender; mix a little 
flour in cold water and stir in to thicken the gravy. Tough steak 
is nice prepared in the same way. 

MEAT BALLS. 

MRS. M. R. KELLOGG. 

Chop fine any kind of cold meat; mix it with one or two eggs, 
and some butter; season it with salt and pepper, and sprinkle 
over flour; roll it in balls and fry brown in hpt lard. 



MEATS. 43 

HASH. 

MES. ANDREWS. 

Chop cold beef to a fine hash, and season it; mash and season 
hot boiled potatoes, and place them around a flat dish for a bor- 
der, two or three inches in width; put the hash in the center and 
cover with fine bread-crumbs, and put into the oven and brown. 

HASH ON TOAST. 

MRS. J. B. STEWART. 

Cold pieces of beefsteak are nice, chopped fine, cooked in a 
little butter and water, and thickened with flour; pour over pieces 
of toast laid on a platter, and moistened with hot water, salted. 
Garnish with hard-boiled eggs. 

HASH, WITH POTATOES. 

MRS. J. P. FOSTER. 

Cold pieces of beef, either boiled, broiled or baked, can be used 
for the dish. Free the meat from all pieces of bone, chop fine, 
and mix with two parts of potatoes to one of beef. Potatoes 
boiled with the skins on are best. They should be cold, and 
chopped not quite so fine as the meat. Put them in a spider with 
melted butter or clarified drippings, and just enough hot water to 
keep from burning. Season to taste, and keep stirring till the 
whole is cooked together. If liked crisped, let it remain still long 
enough to bake a crust on the bottom, and then turn out on a flat 
dish. Other meats may be used instead of beef. 

BEEF AND MUTTON PIE. 
Take slices of tender meat, pound thin and broil ten min- 
utes; cut off the gristly and bony parts; season it highly with 
salt and pepper; butter, and cut it into small pieces. Line a 
pudding-dish with pastry; put in the meat, and to each layer put 
a teaspoonful of tomato catsup, and a large spoonful of water. 
Sprinkle flour over the whole and cover it with pie- crust, having 
a slit in the center of it. Lay strips of pastry over, so as to give 
it a tasteful appearance, and bake it about an hour. Cooked 
mutton, and roast beef or broiled beef, can be made into a good 
pie. Cut them into small pieces, season with salt and pepper; 
add gravy, or butter and water, till you can see it at the top. 



44 MEATS. 

MOCK TERRAPIN. 

MES. M. R. KELLOGG. 

Take half a calf's liver, season, and fry brown; chop it, not 
very fine, and dredge thickly with flour; add two boiled eggs, 
chopped fine, a teaspoonful of made mustard, a very little cayenne 
pepper, and a piece of butter as large as an ^^'g\ pour on a teacup- 
ful of water, and let it boil a few minutes. Veal is very nice to 
use instead of liver, when preferred. This is a good supper dish. 

PRESSED MEAT. 

MISS LIZZIE SMITH. 

Boil till very tender, and pick apart with the fingers, not using 
a knife at all; season with butter, pepper and salt; pour over 
enough of the liquor the meat is boiled in to make it moist; 
press tight over night and slice thin. Nice for chicken or veal. 

ROAST VEAL. 

The shoulder, loin and fillet are the best pieces for roasting. 
The loin is considered the choicest. Veal is less juicy than beef, 
and requires more basting. When nearly done, baste it with 
melted butter, dredge it with flour, and let it brown nicely before 
taking up. For the gravy, mix flour with the fat in the pan, or a 
little butter, and stir into the drippings. Serve in a gravy boat. 

SHOULDER OF VEAL. . 

Remove the bone, and fill the space it occupied with a dressing 
made as for turkey or chicken ; keep well basted and proceed as 
with the above. A fillet of veal may be prepared in the same 
■way, by removing the leg bone with a sharp knife. 

. TO FRY VEAL STEAK. 

MRS. BELLE WARD. 

Cut out all the bone and fat, putting the fat into the frying pan 
to try out while you prepare the steak; pound the steak quite 
thin, and season well wiMi salt and pepper; then dip into a 
mixture of Q^^ and bread crumbs, and lay into the hot fat, frying 
thoroughly until brown. 



MEATS. 45 

SPICED VEAL. 

MRS. G. R. OSGOOD. 

Chop three pounds of veal steak and one thick slice of salt 
pork, as fine as sa,usage meat; add to it three Boston crackers, 
rolled fine; half a teacup of tomato catsup, three well-beaten 
eggs, one and one-half teaspoons of salt, one teaspoon of pepper, 
and one grated lemon; mould it in the form of a loaf of bread, 
put it into a small dripping pan, cover with one rolled cracker, 
and baste with a teacupful of hot water and two tablespoons of 
butter. Bake three hours, basting very often. 

VEAL OR LAMB PATTIES. 

MRS. J. B. STEWART. 

Use cold veal or lamb; chop fine, taking equal parts of meat 
and bread crumbs; season with sage, salt and pepper, and moisten 
with eggs and melted butter, or gravies from the meat; make 
into little cakes, and fry in butter till well browned. 

VEAL LOAF. 

MRS. F. CORNING. 

Three pounds of veal; three-quarters of a pound of salt pork, 
three hard-boiled eggs, chopped fine; six crackers, pounded fine; 
two teaspoons of pepper, two tablespoons of salt; mix well, 
and make into two loaves; bake two hours; baste with butter 
and water. 

VEAL LOAF. 

MRS. R. A. BUNKER, SPRINGFIELD, ILL. 

Three pounds of veal, one and one-half pounds of salt pork, 
both chopped fine; two pounded crackers, two eggs well beaten, 
one nutmeg, two teaspoons of pepper, two teaspoons of 
chopped parsley, two teaspoons of celery, and the rind and 
juice of one lemon. Put batter on the loaf after kneading. Bake 
in a roll, two hours. 

VEAL OMELET. 

MRS. T. E. BROWN. , t • 

Three pounds of raw veal, chopped fine; two p©»»ds of boiled 
pork, also chopped; three eggs, one tablespoon of milk, beaten 



46 MEATS. 

with the eggs, four Boston crackers, pounded fine; two tea- 
spoons of pepper, a scant tablespoon of salt— ^sage to taste. Mix 
well together in the shape of a loaf, and bake two hours. Baste 
often with melted butter and water. 

MOTTLED VEAL. 
Boil an equal number of pounds of salt tongue and lean veal 
separately; boil with the veal half a cup of rice to whiten it, but 
separate it from the veal afterwards; when the meats are quite 
cold, chop each very fine; season the tongue with pepper, sage 
or savory, a teaspoonful of made mustard, a pinch of cloves and 
of cinnamon. The veal can be seasoned the same way, with the 
addition of salt; moisten a little with the water in which the veal 
was boiled, and have bowls, or some small jars, well buttered; 
put in alternate spoonfuls of tongue and veal, so as to have the 
light and dark meat in irregular spots; pack in tightly, smooth 
over the top, pour on melted butter and set away to cool; 
when cool, cover tightly. This keeps some time, and when 
turned out and sliced thin, is a pretty, as well as a savory dish. 

SCALLOPED VEAL. 

MES. A. L. TRISBIE. 

Take cold veal, either baked or boiled; chop it fine; put a layer 
in the bottom of a bettered pudding-dish, and moisten with 
gravy; water in which the bones and refuse pieces of the meat 
have been boiled, answers nicely' ; spread on this a layer of cracker 
crumbs wet with milk, and thus alternate until the dish is full, 
beating an ^g^ with the cracker that is to form the top layer. A 
little ham, chopped with the veal, greatly improves it. 

Remnants of spare-rib or of ham may be used in the same way. 

» VEAL POT-PIE. 

Cut in pieces ready for serving; add two or three slices of 
ham or salt pork; stew very gently till nearly done. A few 
moments before serving, have ready a crust made as for baking 
powder biscuits but rather richer; roll and cut in small squares, 
drop in the boiling gravy, cover, and let it boil till the crust rises 
to the top and is cooked. Serve immediately, or the crust will 
become heavy. Season to taste before putting in the crust. 



MEATS. 47 

VEAL SAUSAGES. 

Take two pounds of lean veal and one pound of salt fat pork; 
grind as for sausage meat, and season in the same way — that is, 
with salt, pepper, and such sweet herbs as you prefer. Fry a 
light brown. 

TO ROAST A SHOULDER OF MUTTON. 

Season and roast the same as beef, basting with butter and 
water till there is gravy enough to use. It requires to be cooked 
more than beef. Serve with currant jelly. 

TO COOK A LEG OF MUTTON. 

MRS. BELLE WARD. 

Put the mutton into warm water, with salt and one small red 
pepper; boil until tender, allowing the water to boil nearly away; 
then take it out, and if not seasoned enough, sprinkle with salt, 
pepper and flour, place in a hot oven with the broth, and 
bake half an hour, basting often until the meat is a light brown. 

MUTTON CHOPS. 

Trim off the superfluous fat, and broil over a bright fire ; season 
and butter them when cooked; do not have them rare. They 
can also be fried by first dredging with flour or bread crumbs. 

FILLET OF MUTTON. 

Cut a fillet, or round, from a leg of mutton; remove all the 
fat from the edges, and take out the bone; rub it all over 
with a very little pepper and salt; have ready a stuffing of finely 
minced onions, bread crumbs and butter, well seasoned and 
mixed; fill with this the place of the bone; make deep incisions 
or cuts all over the surface of the meat and fill them closely with 
the same stuffing; bind a piece of cloth around the meat to keep 
it in shape, and stew with just enough water to cover it; let it 
cook slowly and steadily from four to six hours, in proportion to 
its size and toughness, skimming frequently. When done, serve 
with its own gravy. 



48 MEATS. 

MUTTON FRICASSEE. 

MRS. J. KUHN. 

Cut the meat up in small pieces, and put in boiling butter; 
spice with cloves, nutmeg, onions, salt and bay leaf; after frying 
till brown, pour boiling water over it; cover and boil slowly 
about an hour. 

MUTTON CROQUETTES, 

Remove the fat and skin from cold mutton, mince it fine as 
possible, season, and make up with the gravy into little oval 
balls; dip in o,^'^ and then in bread crumbs and fry brown. 

LAMB WITH RICE. 

Partly roast a small fore-quarter of lamb; cut it in pieces, and 
lay in a dish; season, and pour over it a little water; boil a pint 
of rice till dry, salt it, and stir in a piece of butter, also the yolks 
of four well-beaten eggs, only reserving enough to put over the 
top; spread the rice and the remainder of the eggs over the lamb, 
to form a covering; bake a light brown. 

STEWED LAMB WITH GREEN PEAS. 

For a large dish, take a quarter of nice lamb and cut it into 
steaks; remove the skin and all the fat; season the steaks with 
salt and pepper, and if liked, a little nutmeg; lay them in a 
kettle and pour on just enough water to cover them, and stew 
gently for an hour, skimming when necessary; then add a quart 
or more of young green peas, a lump of loaf sugar, and some bits 
of fresh butter; let it cook slowly till the peas are well done. 
Take them up together, or serve in separate dishes. 

IRISH STEW. 

Take five or six mutton chops; the same quantity of beef, veal 
and pork; six or eight Irish potatoes, peeled and quartered; three 
or four onions sliced, and salt and pepper to taste; add a pint of 
good gravy, flavored with catsup, if liked. Cover all very closely, 
and let it simmer slowly for two hours (never allowing it to stop 
simmering). A slice or two of ham is an improvement. Stir 
occasionally to prevent burning. 



MEATS. 49 

ROAST PIG. 
A pig, to be right for roasting, should be from a month to six 
weeks old. A very essential thing is to see that your butcher 
has done his part in cleansing it thoroughly. Examine every 
part — the ears, mouth and Avhole head, also the fat; if the hair 
should not all be removed, immerse it in hot water and scrape all 
•out. Wash the whole, inside and out, wipe dry, and wrap 
immediately in a wet cloth to keep it from the air. For stuffing, 
take a cup of bread crumbs seasoned as you prefer, and moisten 
with three tablespoonfuls of melted butter; mix all together, 
with a half cup of warm water or milk and two eggs well beaten;, 
then stuff the pig into his natural size and shape, sew him up and 
bend his feet under, close up to his body, and skewer them there; 
dredge with flour, and put into a pan with a little hot water; 
baste with butter first, then with the drippings; when it begins to 
cook, rub it over every few minutes with a cloth dipped in melted 
butter — this makes the skin soft and tender. It will require as 
much as two hours to cook well, perhaps more. Send to the 
table whole, garnished with parsley and celery tops. Skim the 
gravy well and thicken with brown flour; add a little hot water 
if necessary, also some lemon juice. 

ROAST LEG OF PORK. 

This should be from a young pig. Score the skin in lines 
across the leg, as it is to be carved, and put it into a pan with a 
little water; heat slowly at first, or it will blister; baste with 
butter till there is enough of its own gravy for that purpose. 
Pork requires to be thoroughly cooked, and a leg weighing six 
pounds will require at least two hours, with a hot fire. When 
done, take it up, skim the fat from the gravy, add boiling water 
and thicken with flour; season to taste. 

Another way, is to remove the bone with a sharp l^nife, and 
fill the cavity with a dressing made of bread crumbs, seasoned to 
taste; lemon juice or vinegar improves it. The dressing can be 
put in where the skin is scored if the scores are cut deep. The 
leg must be tied with tapes to keep in shape and prevent the 
escape of the dressing; make the gravy as before. Apple sauce 
and pickles are always an acceptable accompaniment of roast 
pork.

50 MEATS. 

ROAST SPARE-RIB. 

Cover with a greased paper till it is half done; remove the 
paper and dredge with flour; baste at first with butter, then with 
its own gravy, quite often. Just before taking up, sprinkle bread 
crumbs seasoned with salt, pepper and sage, thickly over the 
surface; let it cook a few moments and baste with butter. Make 
a gravy and send to the table separately. 

PORK STEAKS. 

Fresh pork steaks should be in nice slices, with the skin taken 
off. Season them with salt, pepper, and sage if liked; broil or 
fry them quickly, using no butter. When fried, and gravy is de- 
sired, mix flour with the fat and pour in boiling water, or milk if 
preferred, and serve separately. 

PORK CHOPS. 

Dip first in beaten ^^^^ then in cracker or bread crumbs; sea- 
son to taste and fry in hot lard, turning often till well done. 

SOUSE. 

MRS. E. P. CHASE. 

Clean pigs' feet and ears thoroughly, and soak them a number 
of days in salt and water; boil them very tender and split them. 
(They are good fried). To souse them cold, pour boiling vinegar 
over them, spiced with pepper-corns and a little salt. They will 
keep good, pickled, for a month or two. 

PIG'S HEAD, (ROASTED.) 

Clean and split the head of a half-grown pig, take out the 
brains and set in a cool place; par-boil the head in salted water, 
then take it out and wipe dry, cover with beaten ^^^^ sprinkle 
thickly with bread crumbs seasoned to taste, and roast, basting 
with butter and the water in which the head was boiled, and in its 
drippings. Wash the brains until they are white, beat them up 
with one-fourth part bread crumbs, pepper and salt, together 
with a beaten Q^^'., make into balls, and roll in flour and fry in 



MEATS. 51 

hot fat to a light brown. Place on the dish around the head, and 
pour on the fat from the dripping-pan; thicken the remainder with 
brown flour and boil up once. 

PRESSED HEAD. 

MRS. M. R. KELLOGG. 

Pig's head is good baked with beans, or cured and smoked. It 
is also good prepared with spices. Boil the several parts of the 
entire head, and the feet, in the same way as for souse. All 
must be boiled so perfectly tender as to have the meat easily 
separated from the bones. After it is neatly separated, chop the 
meat while warm and season with salt, pepper, cloves, nutmeg 
and cinnamon. Put it in a strong bag, and, placing a weight on 
it, let it remain until cold; or put it in any convenient dish, 
placing a plate with a weight on it to press the meat. Cut in' 
slices when used. 

SCRABBLE. 

MRS. C. H. SWEENEV. 

After boiling a pig's head and feet for head-cheese, take a 
cup of the meat and chop fine; put it in one gallon of hot water; 
when it boils hard, stir in meal to make the consistency of mush. 
Salt to taste, pour into a square bread-pan and, when cold, cut in 
slices and fry for breakfast. 

TO COOK A HAM. 

MRS. M. R. KELLOGG. 

Boil it three or four hours, according to the size, then skin it and 
place in the oven for half an hour, then cover with bread crumbs 
and replace in the oven for another half hour. Boiled ham is 
alwa3-s improved by heating in an oven till much of the fat is 
cooked out. 

TO BOIL HAM. 

Ham should be put into cold water to boil; if it is very salt, the 
water should be changed just after it begins to boil. A pint of 
good vinegar added to the water improves the ham very much. 
When boiled tender, remove the skin and, if desired, cut off some 
of the fat. It may be set in an oven fdr a while, or not, just as 
the taste dictates. If set on the table whole, a few cloves stuck 
here and there, give it a pretty appearance. Garnish with celery 
tops or sprigs of parsley.

STEAMED HAM. 

Lay in cold water for twelve hours, scrape and wash thoroughly. 
Place a steamer over a pot of boiling water, put in the ham and 
cover closely; keep the water boiling all the time; allow twenty- 
five minutes steaming for each pound of meat. Skin while hot. 

TO GLAZE HAM. 

The ham should be a cold boiled one, from which the skin was 
removed when hot. Cover the ham all over with beaten ^-^^'t 
make a thick paste of cream, pounded cracker, salt and a 
teaspoonful of melted butter. Spread this evenly over the ham 
and brown in a moderate oven. 

BROILED HAM. 

If very salt, soak the slices in lukewarm water half an hour, 
then take them out, cut off the rind and broil quickly over hot 
coals. If cooked slowly, it will harden, 

FRIED HAM. 

If too salt, put the slices in cold water in the frying-pan, let it 
come to a boil, turn it off and fry the ham quickly, turning often. 

HAM AND EGGS. 

Fry the ham quickly; 'remove from the pan as soon as done. 
Drop the eggs, one at a time, into the hot fat; be careful not to let 
the yolks break and run, and keep the eggs as much separated as 
possible, to preserve their shape. The ham should be cut in 
pieces the right size to serve and, when the eggs are done, one 
should be laid on each piece of ham. If any eggs remain, they 
can be placed uniformly on the edge of the platter. 

TO WARM HAM. 

MRS. A. L. FEISBIE. 

Take any pieces of cold boiled or fried ham, chop them with 
bread and put the mixture into the stew-pan. When it is hot, 
break into it one or two eggs, according to the quantity; season 
with pepper and salt to the taste. Stir constantly after break- 
ing in the eggs, and serve as soon as the eggs are sufficiently 
cooked. 



MEATS. 53 

HAM TOAST. 

Chop some lean boiled ham fine, put it in a pan with a little 
pepper and a lump of butter; when quite hot stir in two well- 
beaten eggs, mix quickly, spread on hot buttered toast. 

HAM SANDWICHES. 

Cut bread in thin slices, butter them and lay between each two 
some nice slices of cold boiled ham. A little mustard spread on 
the meat, improves it for many. 

FRIED SALT PORK. 

MRS. C. H. RAWSON. 

Take a nice piece of pork with scarcely any lean, cut in thin 
slices; have the skillet half full of either warm or cold water^ 
lay the pieces in and let them remain until the water boils, then 
take them out, turn out the water, roll the pieces in flour or 
Indian meal and fry till a delicate brown on both sides. 

PORK SAUSAGES. 

Take thirty pounds of pork, mostly lean; chop it very fine, 
season with eight ounces of salt, one -half ounce of salt-petre, two 
ounces of pepper, and such sweet herbs as suit the taste. They 
should be finely sifted; sage, summer savory, or sweet marjoram 
are all good. To keep for family use, the meat can be packed in 
stone jars and covered with a cloth, over which pour melted lard. 
When used, make into cakes. 

Bags for holding the meat, may be made of old white muslin, 
large enough to allow a slice to be from three to four inches in 
diameter. Keep in a cool place. 

BAKED PORK WITH APPLES. 

MRS. C. H. SWEENEY. 

Put the roast in a pan and season well with salt and pepper. 
When about half done or more, pour off the fat, then surround 
your roast with apples prepared in the following way: pare the 
upper part of the apples about two inches wide, and put a band 
or cap of dough around the peeled part; place in the pan as 
described, and bake till done. This is very nice.

NEW ENGLAND SAUSAGES. 



MRS. A. Y. RAWSON. 

To fifty pounds of meat, cut fine, put seventeen and one-half 
ounces of salt, three and one-half ounces of pepper, ten ounces of 
sage and savory. 

TO PREPARE LARD. 

MRS. C. D. SPRAGUE. 

Obtain the "leaf" from a butcher, skin and scrape till it is 
clean, then cut it up in small pieces, and put over the fire in an 
iron kettle, which should be scrupulously clean, with a little 
water. When about half cooked, add a small teaspoonful of dry 
soda. As this makes the lard foam up, it is necessary to have 
room in the kettle, so it shall not boil over. When done, most 
of the scraps will be eaten up, and the lard will be very pure 
and white. Strain into a tin or stone vessel, and keep in a cool, 
dry place. It remains hard in warm weather. 

CORNED BEEF. 

MISS LIZZIE SMITH, MT. CARROL, ILLS. 

To 6 gallons of water, add 9 lbs. of pure salt, 3 lbs. of brown 
sugar, 1 qt. molasses, 3 oz. of salt-petre, 1 oz. pearlash. Let 
these ingredients be boiled and carefully skimmed as long as im- 
purities rise to the surface. When the water is ready to receive 
the rest of the material, pour in the salt-petre only, and when 
dissolved, and the water boiling, dip your beef, piece by piece, 
into the salt-petre walEfer, holding it in for a few seconds only. 

When the beef has been thus immersed and become quite cool, 
pack it in the cask where it is to remain; when the pickle is per- 
fectly cold, pour it on the meat which ' should be kept down by 
cover and stone. This amount of pickle is intended for 100 lbs. of 
beef. The immersion of the beef in hot salt-petre water contracts 
the surface by closing the pores and prevents the juices of the 
meat from going out into the pickle. The salt-petre absorbed by 
the contracted or cooked surfaces will modify the salt that passes 
through it, the whole producing the most perfect result.

BRINE FOR CURING BEEF. 

MKS. T. HUNT. ^ 

To 100 lbs. of beef, take 10 lbs. of salt and 2 of salt-petre, 1 
qt. of molasses. Boil and skim ; when cold, pour over the meat. 

FOR CURING PORK AND HAMS. 

MRS. M. R. KELiLOGG. 

For pork, make brine enough to cover the pork (let it be as 
strong as possible). For every layer of pork put a layer of ground 
black pepper, say 1 lb. to a barrel. Put in 3 or 4 oz. of salt-pe- 
tre; this is not enough to make it taste, yet it is enough to keep 
the hams from getting hard. When used the second time do not 
scald the brine. For hams, to each 100 lbs. take 9 lbs. of salt, 
5 oz. of salt-petre, 1 qt. of molasses, a large spoonful of soda and 
4 Oz. of ground black pepper. Let the hams remain in brine from 4 
to 6 da^*^ smoke and sack. Care should be taken to prevent the 
pork from freezing, or to be sure the frost is all out vsrhen put in 
the brine. This is a very superior receipt. 

BRINE FOR HAM. 

MRS. C. P. HOLMES. 

12 lbs. salt, \ lb. salt-petre, 3 qts. molasses, to 6 gals, water. 
Boil and skim; when cool, pour over the meat. Before packing, 
take salt, salt-petre and molasses and rub the ends around the 
bone. This for 100 lbs. 

TO CURE HAMS. 

For curing fifty pounds, allow three quarts of coarse salt, one- 
half pound of salt-petre, and two quarts good molasses. Add 
enough soft water to cover the hams. Common sized hams 
should be kept in this pickle five weeks, larger ones six. They 
should all be taken out once a week, and those which Avere on 
the top laid in first, and the lower ones last. They should be 
smoked from two to three weeks with walnut wood, or with saw- 
dust and corn cobs mixed. Meat smoked with cobs is very 
delicate. 

Pieces of beef for smoking may be laid in this pickle after the 
hams are sent to the smoke-house, but more salt should be added. 



56 . . MEATS. 

HOW TO KEEP HAMS THROUGH THE SUMMER. 

When removed from the smoke house, do not suffer a fly to 
come near them, but immediately sew them in a coarse cloth or 
stiff brown paper and pack them in slacked ashes. There is no 
method so sure to preserve them from insects, and the effect of 
the ashes is to improve the meat, but care should be taken that 
the hams be so secured that the ashes will not touch them. The 
ashes should be perfectly cold and dry and the barrel be in a dry, 
cool place. 



i^aa^. 




W^ UCCESS in nice cooking greatly depends on the fresh- 
ness of the eggs used. There are various ways of 
|t^>fi^ determining in regard to this, but none appear to be 

infallible. Old stale eggs are cold all over, fresh eggs 

have a warm spot on the big end, which may be de. 

tected by applying it to the tongue. Another : If placed 
in cold water, a fresh egg will go to the bottom and lie on the 
side, a bad egg will float, a stale egg may sink but will stand on 
one end. When eggs are plenty it is a good plan to pack them 
for use at times when it is difficult to procure them. Some of the 
simpler methods of preserving them are to pack them in bran or 
salt with the small end down. If they are to be kept some time, 
it is better to grease the shells before packing them. Mix half a 
pint of unslacked lime with the same quantity of salt and a couple 
of gallons of water. The water should be turned on the lime 
boiling hot; when it is cold lay the eggs in with great care not to 
crack the shells, otherwise they will spoil very soon. The eggs 
should be perfectly fresh when put in. Do not make the lime- 
water any stronger, or the lime will eat the shells. They should 
be kept in a cool place, but never allowed to become chilled or 
frozen. 

FRIED EGGS. 

MKS. A. L. FEISBIE. 

Put a very little butter in each cup of a gem pan, which should 
be hot enough to hiss, break an egg into each cup and fry till the 
eggs are hard as is desired. This is a quick and easy way of fry- 
ing eggs; as they preserve the shape of the cup, it makes a very 
pretty dish. 

57 



58 EGGS. 

BAKED EGGS. 

MRS. J. P. POSTER. 

Break into a well buttered, shallow tin plate, five or six eggs, 
(five is better), sprinkle over a little salt and pepper and bits of 
butter; place in a moderately hot oven till the whole sets. This 
makes a very delicate and pretty breakfast dish. 

SCRAMBLED EGGS. 

Put a piece of good butter into a frying-pan and, when hot, 
pour in the eggs, which should be previously broken in a dish 
and seasoned. Stir constantly till cooked as much as desired, 
and serve in a hot dish. Cook them just as the meal is ready to 
be eaten, for they are not good if allowed to stand. Some add a 
little milk or cream with the eggs. 

POACHED EGGS. 

Have the water boiling, and the toast moistened in a little salt 
water, and buttered. Break the eggs, one by one, carefully into 
the water, let them boil till the white sets, remove with an eg^g 
slice, pare off the ragged edges and lay each egg upon a slice of 
toast; put over bits of butter, salt and pepper. Eggs require to be 
quite fresh to poach nicely. 

.BOILED EGGS. 

The most delicate way of preparing eggs is by pouring over 
them boiling water, and letting them stand 15 minutes closely cov- 
ered. If kept hot without boiling, the white becomes very ten- 
der and delicate. An egg cooked the day it is laid requires a 
longer time to cook than one that is a day or two old. 

ANOTHER WAY. 

Put the eggs on in cold water and let it come to a boil, or 
place them in a sauce pan of boiling water, being careful not to 
let them crack or break, by dropping them in. Three minutes 
will be enough to cook them if desired soft, ten if hard. 

PICKLED EGGS. 

Boil as many as you wish to pickle until quite hard; when done, 
place in cold water till you can remove the shells, being careful 



EGGS. 69 

not to mar the eggs. Lay them in wide-mouthed jars and pour 
over them scalding vinegar well seasoned with whole pepper, 
allspice and a few pieces of ginger root, or such spices as you may 
prefer. When cold, cover closely and let them remain for a 
month, when they will be ready for use. They make a nice relish 
for cold meats. 

OMELET. 

MRS. G. M. HIPPEE.

WHITE SAUCE. 

■S:^M^|i?i UT a piece of butter about the size of an egg into a 
.. sauce-pan, set over a good fire, have a wooden spoon 
ready and move the butter all over the bottom of the 
(■jjTD pan, so as to melt it as fast as possible, without allowing it 
Iv. to burn. Then take the sauce-pan from the fire, put in it 
about two tablespoonfuls of flour and stir the flour" well and 
fast, so as to mix it thoroughly with the butter; no lumps must 
be left. If the butter cools before the flour is mixed, set the pan 
back on the fire a inoment. When well mixed, heat again, stir- 
ring fast, until the mixture turns of a yellowish color, when the 
flour is cooked. To finish, pour into the pan the liquor to be 
used, either water, milk or broth, stir and mix it with the butter 
and flour over the fire, then season and it is ready. 

DRAWN BUTTER. 

Mix smoothly several teaspoonfuls of flour with cold water, and 
pour into two-thirds of a pint of boiling water, stirring briskly un- 
til the whole boils up well; then remove it from the fire, but keep 
it warm. Have ready about a quarter of a pound of good butter, 
cut into small pieces, and stir them into the liquid. When the 
butter is melted, the sauce is ready for use. It should be free 
from lumps, but if not, it must be strained through a small sieve. 
If the butter is to be used for fish, put in slices of hard boiled 
eggs or capers. It may be converted into curry sauce by sprink- 
ling in a little curry powder.

FIRST thought may be, "Very little need be said on 
that subject; anybody can cook vegetables!" I beg 
leave to differ; many think it such a simple thing to do, 
that they fail to give enough care and thought to their pre- 
paration to make them sufficiently attractive and palatable. 
In France no family, in the middle station of life, ever dines 
without a dish of dressed vegetables, upon which as much care 
has been bestowed in cooking as upon the principal dish of the 
dinner, and which is often eaten alone. 

RULES APPLICABLE TO THE COOKING OF ALL VEG- 
ETABLES. 

First. Have them as fresh as possible; summer vegetables 
should be cooked on the same day they are gathered, if possible. 
Second. Lay them, when peeled, in cold water for some time 
before cooking. Third. If to be boiled, put a little salt in ths 
water. Fourth. Cook them steadily after you put them on. 
Fifth. Be sure they are thoroughly done — rare vegetables are 
neither palatable nor healthy. Sixth. Drain well. Seventh. Serve 
hot. 

ARTICHOKES. 

Boil till tender, drain well, season with salt, pepper and melt- 
ed butter. Some prefer them pickled raw, either whole or sliced. 

JERUSALEM ARTICHOKES. 

These may be sliced and boiled like turnips, or cooked in any 
way in which Irish potatoes are cooked. They require longer 
boiling than potatoes. Boiled and dressed as a salad, they are 
considered particularly good.

ASPARAGUS. 



If brought from market, keep it co6l and moist, till wanted. 
This may be done by putting it in the cellar with the cut ends in 
a dish of water. Let it lie in cold water a. few minutes before 
cooking. Cut off all that is tough and tie in small bundles. 
Have the water boiling hot, and use just enough to cover the as- 
paragus. Boil fifteen or twenty minutes. Have some bread 
toasted, dip it in the liquor, lay in the dish, butter it, skim out 
the asparagus and lay on the toast, butter and pepper it, thicken 
the liquor a little and pour over the whole. 

ANOTHER WAY TO COOK ASPARAGUS. 

MISS AGNES NEWTON. 

Cook very much as you do green peas. Cat the asparagus into 
small pieces, and put into boiling water, with a little salt. Boil 
about three-quarters of an hour, then add butter and pepper and 
thicken a little with flour stirred in milk. 

BEETS. 
Beets must not be cut before boiling, as this causes them to 
lose their sweetness. Salt the water and, when done, take them 
out into a pan of cold water, and rub the skins off quickly; slice 
them, and dress with butter, pepper and salt, or vinegar if desired. 
Old beets lose their sweetness, and are best, served with hot 
spiced vinegar, into which has been stirred a little sugar. 

BEET GREENS. 
Take young beets, boil tops and bottoms in salt water, drain 
well in a colander, butter and eat with vinegar; an excellent dish 
in summer. 

STRING BEANS. 

MRS. J. P. FOSTER. 

Break off both ends and "string" carefully, then break into inch 
pieces. Put them in boiling water enough to cover them, taking 
care that they do not boil dry; throw in salt enough to season 
them, and cook from two to three hours. When done, drain 
nearly all the water off; add milk, butter and pepper. Thicken a 
little if desired. 



VEGETABLES. ' 71 

ANOTHER WAY. 

String and boil whole with a small piece of corned beef or 
pickled pork, enough to season them. Stew nearly dry and 
serve hot. 

TO DRY LIMA BEANS. 

MRS. J. P. FOSTER. 

Gather the beans when in a right state to cook. String the 
pods with a darning-needle threaded with twine. Hang the strings 
in a shady, airy place till the pods are thoroughly dried, then 
shell and hang up the beans in a paper bag till needed for use. 
They require to be soaked over night, then cooked as when 
green. They make nice winter succotash with dried sweet-corn. 

LIMA AND BUTTER BEANS. 

Shell into cold water, and let them lie awhile; boil an hour, 
with a little salt in the water; drain and butter well, peppering 
to taste. 

ANOTHER WAY. 

Prepare and cook as above, and pour a teacup of sweet cream 
over the beans, and let it boil up; salt and pepper to suit the 
taste. 

SUCCOTASH. 

MRS. M. N. MILES. 

This is usually made of green corn and Lima beans, though for 
the latter, string or butter beans may be substituted. Boil the 
beans nearly an hour; while they are boiling, prepare the corn, 
thus: clean thoroughly from husk and silk, cut off the corn care- 
fully from the cob and with the back of the knife scrape the cob 
gently. Add the corn to the beans ten minutes before taking up. 
While boiling, season to the taste with salt, pepper and butter. 
Do not have too much water in the beans, and do not let them boil 
dry. A little cream added, improves it, 

BEAN PODS FOR PICKLING. 

String and boil till tender, in salt water; drain off the water 
and pour over them hot spiced vinegar. They are good for use 
in a day or two, and make a nice relish with meats.

BAKED BEANS. 

MRS. J. M. LAIED. 

Take one quart of dry beans, parboil them till they begin to 
burst open, then drain them out into a deep dish and put in two 
tablespoonfuls of molasses. Put a piece of salt pork the size of a 
coffee-cup into the centre of the dish and cover it with the beans; 
add salt if your pork is fresh; till your dish with the- water from 
the beans and keep it filled until almost done, then bake until 
dry. They should bake five or six hours. 

BAKED BEANS WITHOUT PORK. 

MKS. LEWIS, CHICAGO. 

One quart of beans soaked over night and parboiled in the 
morning, changing the water several times. Put into an earthen 
crock, with salt, a piece of butter the size of an egg, water to 
cover, and bake all day. 

BAKED BEANS. 

The "Household" says: "Many people do not understand how 
to have nice baked beans. Bake the beans all day, and if con- 
venient, let theln stay in over night, baking full twenty-four 
hours, and our word for it, they will come out in the morning 
with a flavor that will make your mouth water to taste them. We 
sometimes see persons who only have a moderate liking for baked 
beans, who invariably bake them three or four hours, and that is 
why they do not like them any better. A day and a night is none 
too much time to bake them, having parboiled them only until 
the skins will crack, when the air comes to them." 

CABBAGE. 

In preparing the various dishes from this excellent vegetable, 
care should be taken in the choice of the heads. For boiling or 
for hot slaws, loose heads may be used, but for slicing and eating 
raw with the different kinds of dressing, a white^ firm head should 
be selected. Many who like cabbage, will not cook it on account 
of the odor which it exhales. Harper's Bazar says this is easily 
prevented by putting in the pot with the cabbage, a piece of 
charcoal tied in a cloth, and simmering instead of boiling. 



VEGETABLES. 73 

BOILED CABBAGE. 

After removing all the loose, outside leaves, cut the cabbage 
in halves, lay in a pan with the cut sides up and cover with salt 
water. Let it stand a few minutes, and turn out quickly. (This 
is done to remove any insects that may be hidden in the cabbage.) 
Put in the kettle with boiling water enough to cover it, adding 
sufficient salt. When tender, take up in a colander to drain, 
then put in a hot dish and cover with slices of butter. Some like 
cabbage boiled in the liquor in which corned beef or ham has 
been boiled. When coOked in this way the meat is first taken 
out, as the flavor of the cabbage would injure it. Skim off the 
grease before putting the cabbage in; boil briskly; when done, it 
will sink to the bottom; drain well. 

CABBAGE COOKED IN MILK. 

MRS. n. C. HARRIS. 

Chop the cabbage fine, put in a stew-pan and cover with sweet 
milk; let it cook slowly, as the milk will burn easily, until ten- 
der; season with pepper, salt and butter. 

COLD SLAW. 

MRS. J. P. POSTER. 

Slice or chop the cabbage fine. It is better to be sliced. Put 
it in a vegetable dish in layers, with a little salt and pepper on 
each layer. Take one cup of thick cream, either sweet or sour, 
make quite sweet with sugar and stir in briskly half a cup of 
vinegar. Pour the dressing on just as you sit down to eat. 

CABBAGE DRESSING. 

MRS. G. R. OSGOOD. 

To four well-beaten eggs stir in, over a slow fire, one pint of 
vinegar until quite thick and hot (not boiling), then mix in two 
teaspoonfuls each of mustard, black pepper and salt, one-half cup 
of oil or melted butter. Do not turn it over the cabbage, or cauli- 
flower until quite cold. It can be kept in a cool place for a 
month. 



74 VEGETABLES. 

CABBAGE DRESSING. 

MRS. H. C. HARRIS. 

Yolks of two eggs, two tablespoonfuls of vinegar, a small tea- 
spoonful of mustard, a little salt, a small lump of butter rubbed 
in flour. Heat, and pour hot over chopped cabbage. 

FRIED CABBAGE. 

. E. A. C. 

The cabbage should be sliced as for slaw, only much coarser; 
put it in a skillet with water sufficient to cover. Boil twenty 
minutes, having it closely covered, then pour off most of the 
water; add butter, pepper, salt and half a teacup of vinegar, and 
let it cook about ten minutes longer. 

CAULIFLOWER. 

MRS. E. A. C. 

After taking off the leaves, boil about half an hour in salted 
water, drain, and just before sending to the table, pour on a little 
drawn butter made with milk. 

CREAM CABBAGE. 

MRS. C. D. SPRAGUE. 

Slice cabbage as for cold slaw, and salt it. Pour over while 
hot the following: one small cup of vinegar, one well-beaten egg, 
and a small piece of butter. Let the cabbage stand till cold, and 
pour over it one-half cup of sweet cream. 

HOT SLAW. 

MRS. y^. H. SIBLEY. 

Mince or slice the cabbage, the finer the better. Put a piece 
of butter the size of half an egg into the spider; when melted, 
put in the cabbage, and a cup of boiling water, salt and pepper. 
Cover close, and cook till tender and dry. Have ready an q^^^ 
well beaten, half a cup of vinegar, a tablespoonful of sugar, (more 
if you wish,) thoroughly mixed, and pour over the cabbage the 
last thing before taking up. Stir for a moment and serve hot. 



VEGETABLES. 75 

TO COOK CAULIFLOWER. 

• » 

Pick off all the green leaves and soak the head in salt water 
two or three hours, then boil 20 or 30 minutes in milk and water 
(using half as much milk as water) with a little salt. When taken 
up put on a little butter and eat with vinegar and pepper. Some 
prefer drawn butter poured over it before sending to the table. 

CAULIFLOWER. 

MKS. DR. HOFFMAN, BEARDSTOWK, ILL. 

After preparing the cauliflower, put it into equal parts of boil- 
ing water and milk, (the latter improves the appearance and 
taste), a little salt and a piece of fresh butter. Cook it, but not 
too soft; it should retain its form. Stir the yolks of two or three 
eggs and a little flour into some cold meat soup, add a little of 
the water in which the cauliflower has been boiled and, a few 
drops of lemon juice; set the whole into a pot containing boiling 
water until it begins to thicken, and pour it over the cauliflower, 
which has been previously arranged in a dish. If desired, a little 
grated nutmeg may be added. 

STEWED CARROTS. 
Half boil the carrots; then scrape them nicely, and cut them 
into thick slices. Put them into a stew-pan with as much milk as 
will bajely cover them, a very little salt and pepper and a sprig 
'or two of chopped parsley. Simmer them till they are perfectly 
tender but not broken. When nearly done, add a piece of fresh 
butter rolled in flour. Send them to the table hot. Carrots 
require long cooking. 

TO PRESERVE CORN. 

MRS. WYLIE BURTON. 

Cut the corn from the cob, and put down in an earthen jar, with 
every sixth measure, salt; measure with a pint cup. When the jar is 
full, let the first covering be of the inside leaves of the husk put 
down on the corn. For cooking, have a large kettle full of boil- 
ing water; squeeze the brine from the corn, and put it in the boil- 
ing water without washing; let it boil until the water is*quite salt; 
have a tea-kettle of boiling water ready to put on the corn as soon 
as the salt water is poured off; change the water until the corn is 
sufficiently freshened. Season with butter, cream and a little su- 
gar and pepper. 



76 VEGETABLES. 

CORN FRITTERS. 

MRS. J. P. FOSTER. 

Boil and grate six ears of corn. Add three eggs, beaten, half 
a cup of milk, one teaspoonful of salt, pepper, butter the size of 
a hickory-nut, and flour enough to make a batter. Have a little 
lard or butter hot in a spider, drop in the batter and turn as you 
do batter cakes. A nice dish for breakfast, made from corn 
boiled for dinner the day before. 

CORN PUDDING FOR MEATS. 

MRS. J. P. FOSTER. 

Take six large ears of corn, boil ten minutes, cut the corn fine 
and mix with two heaping tablespoonfuls of flour, one pint sweet 
milk, salt, pepper and butter. Bake from half to three-quarters 
of an hour. Serve hot. 

HULLED CORN. 

MRS. H. C. HARRIS. 

Take two quarts of dry, rijDe corn; put two and one-half tea-cups 
of hard wood ashes in a bag and place (with the corn) in warm water 
in a kettle, with sufficient water to cover the corn; let it come to a 
boil, and in the morning (the corn is to be fixed at night), if the 
hulls do not come ofi", boil again. As soon as they will come ofi", 
wash in several waters with the hands, and put into cold or milk 
warm water, and boil until tender; be sure to have a good deal of 
water, or the corn will burn. 

GREEN CORN FOR WINTER USE. 
Parboil it, cut it from the cobs, dry in the sun, put in a bag 
and hang in a dry place. When wanted for the table, soak sev- 
eral hours, and cook slowly half an hour, without boiling. 

■GREEN CORN CAKES. 

MRS. J. P. FOSTER. 

Mix a pint of grated sweet corn with three tablespoonfuls of 
milk, a teacup of flour, a large spoonful of salt, a little pepper 
and one ^g'g. Drop this mixture by the large spoonful into a 
frying-pan, and fry till brown; use butter for frying. These are 
nice served with meat for dinner. 



VEGETABLES. 77 

TO BOIL GREEN CORN. 

MES. M. N. MILES. 

Green corn should be boiled only ten minutes, either on the cob 
or cut off, to suit the taste. 

CUCUMBERS. 

The chief desideratum in preparing cucumbers for the table, is 
to make them cool and crisp. Many consider them very un- 
wholesome, but if they are pared and sliced into a dish of cold 
salt water, an hour before needed, they will certainly be less so. 
If you have ice, lay a piece in the dish in which they are brought 
to the table. Eat with salt, pepper and vinegar. 

CUCUMBER RELISH. 

MRS. WYLIE BURTON. 

Take the largest cucumbers that are not yellow, slice them a 
little thicker and salt a little more than for the table. Slice at 
night, and in the morning squeeze every particle of fluid from 
them. Put them into a jar, with white mustard seed, a little 
mace and sliced horse-radish to taste. Cover them with white 
wine vinegar. They will keep good the year round if prepared 
in this way. 

EGG PLANT. 

MRS, W. H. SIBLEY. 

Peel the ^^s, plant, cut in rather thin slices, strew salt between 
them; let them stand ten or fifteen minutes, drain the juice from 
them, cover with cold water and let them stand a half hour long- 
er; drain them as dry as possible, roll each slice in flour; have 
ready a hot frying-pan or spider, the bottom covered with butter; 
lay in the slices, pepper them, and fry a rich brown. The sooner 
eaten after cooking, the better. 

EGG PLANT. 

F . 

The purple variety is best. Peel and parboil; mash fine and 
season with salt, pepper and butter, to taste. Put this mixture in 
a deep earthen dish, lay over it bread crumbs and bits of but- 
ter, and bake a light brown color. 



78 VEGETABLES. 

ANOTHER WAY. 



After peeling the egg plant, parboil it five or six minutes, then 
cut the slices crosswise, and season with pepper and salt; dip them 
in beaten ^^^ and then in fine cracker crumbs; fry a light brown 
in hot lard. Serve with a folded napkin upon the bottom of the 
dish; send to the table as fast as cooked. They must be thor- 
oughly cooked. 

GREENS. 

The leaves of white mustard, spinach, water cresses, cowslips, 
dandelions, and the roots and tops of small beets are good for 
greens. If not fresh and plump, soak in salt water for half an 
hour previous to cooking. Boil them with a little salt in the wa- 
ter, until they sink to the bottom of the pot. Drain very dry in a 
colander; butter and serve. 

ONIONS. 

The onion is one of the most healthful of all the vegetables, 
and is especially beneficial to those whose labor taxes the brain 
or those who are afflicted with nervous diseases; but owing to its 
unpleasant effects upon the breath many persons eschew it alto- 
gether. It is said that chewing and swallowing a few grains of 
roasted coffee will remove this difficulty, and any utensil in which 
onions have been cooked may be freed from their odor by turning 
it bottom upwards, over a hot stove after it has been washed. 

For seasoning, the red oqion will answer, but for boiling, stew- 
ing, etc., the white silver-skinned and sweet onion are greatly 
preferable. 

BAKED ONIONS. 

For baking, large onions only should be used. Wash them 
and boil an hour with the skins on, in slightly salt water; let the 
water be boiling when they are put in; change the water once or 
twice during the hour. Take out the onions, lay them on a cloth 
that the moisture may pass off; roll each one in a round piece of 
buttered tissue paper, twisted at the top to keep it close, and bake 
in a moderate oven nearly an hour. When cooked tender, remove 
the skin, and brown, basting with butter; season with pepper and 
salt, and pour over the melted butter. 



VEGETABLES. 79 

• ONIONS BOILED. 

Cut a slice from both ends, and skin them. They are improved 
by laying them in cold water, after peeling, for a half hour or 
more. Cover them with boiling w^ater and milk; cook fifteen or 
twenty minutes. Change the water, have a tea-kettle of boiling 
water ready, add a little milk, and boil till tender. Drain, and 
season with rich milk or cream, butter, salt and pepper, and let 
the whole simmer on the back of the stove before serving. Never 
cook in an iron pot. 

YOUNG ONIONS STEWED. 



After skinning, lay them in cold water half an hour or more. 
Put into a sauce-pan with hot water enough to cover them. When 
about half cooked, throw off nearly all the water, add some milk, 
a tablespoonful of butter, with seasoning to taste; stew gently 
till tender, dish up and serve. 

ONIONS FRIED. 

Prepare as for boiling, slice and put into a stew-pan with a lit- 
tle boiling w^ater; cover closely, and let them steam fifteen or 
twenty minutes; remove the cover that the water may all evapo- 
rate, and, at the same time add a good sized piece of butter, salt 
and pepper, and let them fry brown, stirring often to prevent their 
burning. Serve hot. 

PARSNIPS. 

MRS. A. Y. EAWSON. 

Scrape the parsnips clean and boil until tender; if not very 
large an hour will be long enough to cook them; then cut in slices 
lengthw'ise, and have ready a hot frying-pan well buttered, and 
fry a light brown. Spread a little butter on each slice after it is 
done, if desired. 

ANOTHER WAY. 

MRS. W. H. SIBLEY. 

Prepare as above, mash well, season with a little butter, pep- 
per and salt. Make into balls or cakes, roll in flour and fry as 
you would slices. 



80 VEGETABLES. 

PARSNIP FRITTERS. 

Boil tender, mash smooth and fine, picking oni all the hard 
parts. For two large parsnips, allow one egg, two-thirds of a cup 
of rich milk, one tablespoonful of butter, one of salt and three 
tablespoonfuls of flour. Beat the eggs light, stir in the mashed 
parsnips, beating hard, then the butter and salt, lastly the milk. 
Fry as fritters, or as griddle cakes. 

MASHED PARSNIPS. 

Boil and scrape them, mash smooth, picking out the fibres; 
mix in three or four spoonfuls of cream, a large spoonful of but- 
ter, pepper and salt to taste. Heat to boiling in a sauce-pan and 
serve, heaping in a mound as you would potatoes cooked in the 
same way. 

POTATOES. 

This root still bears its original American name, signifying 
"Earth apple," and is divided into many varieties, the most 
common of which are Early and Late Rose, White Neshannock, 
Peach-Blows, Mercer, Peerless, Irish Grays or Jersey Blues, Prince 
Albert, etc. Next to bread, there is no vegetable article, the prepa- 
ration of which, as food, "deserves to be more attended to than, 
the potato." "The great art of cooking potatoes is, to take them 
up as soon as done. When boiled, baked, fried or steamed, they 
are rendered watery by continuing to cook after they reach the 
proper point. For this reason potatoes to bake or boil, should be 
of nearly the same size." 

SARATOGAS— FRIED POTATOES. 

MES. MARY MYERS. 

Wash, pare and slice some raw potatoes; cut each slice an inch 
and a half long, half an inch wide and a quarter of an inch thick. 
Let them lie in cold water until the other preparations for break- 
fast are made. Have ready in a frying-pan some hot lard or nice 
drippings. Take the potatoes out of the water into a cloth, wipe 
dry, fry quickly a light brown. Remove from the lard with a 
perforated skimmer, into a deep dish in which a napkin has been 
laid. Sprinkle with salt, and eat while hot, if you want them 
crisp and nice. Some slice them very thin. 



VEGETABLES. 81 

YOUNG POTATOES. 

MRS. HILL. 

To cook them when very young, wash them, scrape off the 
skin, put them in a stew-pan, cover with hot water, boil gently 
until tender and pour off the water. Add to a quart of potatoes 
a heaped tablespoonful of butter, with a teaspoonful of flour 
rubbed into it, pour in a tumblerful of sweet cream or milk, stew, 
uncovered, five minutes; serve in a hot dish. 

BOILED POTATOES. 

There is a conflict of authorities as to whether cold, or boiling 
water should be used when putting the potatoes to cook. The 
result of our experiments stands somewhat thus: Garnet, White 
Fountain and Early Rose are apt to dissolve in cold water, giving 
off their starch too readily, perhaps; we boil them in hot water. 
Peach-Blows, Prince Alberts, and other late varieties, are best 
put in cold water, ahrays pouring off the water the instant they 
are done, and letting the potatoes dry a few minutes. 

BAKED POTATOES. 
Select medium sized, smooth potatoes; bake in a quick oven 
from half to three-quarters of an hour, according to size of 
potato and amount of heat. If eaten as soon as done, they are 
warranted to be good. 

STEWED POTATOES FOR BREAKFAST. 
Pare and slice into cold water enough potatoes for the family 
meal; stew in enough salted water to cover them; watch and 
stir them from the bottom occasionally, that they may not burn. 
When tender, add a cup of milk; let it boil up; put in a lump of 
butter, salt and pepper enough to season properly. Thicken 
slightly with flc)ur. Turn into a covered dish. 

POTATO CAKES. 

MRS. J. P. FOSTER. 

Take enough good sized potatoes for a meal, peel and grate on 
a coarse grater and stir in from three to five eggs, then add a 
little flour and season to taste. Beat well and fry in hot lard. 
One good sized spoonful makes a cake.

MASHED POTATOES. 

< L. V. S, 

Pare and let them lie in cold water from five to fifty minutes, ac- 
cording to convenience, unless they are old potatoes, when they 
are improved by being longer in water. "Boil in hot or cold 
water, according to the toughness of texture. A coarse, waxy 
potato, is best cooked in cold water." Throw in a little salt; 
drain thoroughly; when done, put in another pinch of salt, and 
mash in the pot with a potato beetle till all the lumps disappear. 
Add a tablespoonful of butter, milk or cream to moisten suffi- 
ciently, and beat the whole with a large spoon till it is foamy. 
Some then form the whole into a mound on a plate, butter the 
surface and brown slightly in the oven. 

POTATO BALLS— A BREAKFAST DISH. 

MRS. "W. H. SIBLEY. 

Mashed potatoes left from dinner, make a nice dish for break- 
fast if prepared thus: put them into a deep dish, pour in a little 
rich milk or cream; beat the white of an ^g%^ and work the whole 
together until well mixed. Make into balls or cakes three-fourths 
of an inch thick, and roll in flour. Have ready in a frying-pan a 
little melted butter, just enough to keep them from adhering. 
Brown nicely on both sides. Serve in a hot dish. 

SWEET POTATOES. 

The best way to cook sweet potatoes, is to bake them with their 
skins on. Some boil them till nearly done, then put in the oven 
and finish. Others boil them till done and serve hot. When 
boiled, if any are left over, they are excellent sliced and fried for 
breakfast the next day. Another way is to pare, and place in the 
dripper in which you are roasting beef, basting occasionally till 
done. They are delicious cooked in this way, as also are Irish 
potatoes. 

SUMMER SQUASH. 

A few general rules are applicable for the cooking of the differ- 
ent kinds of this vegetable. Unless they are very young and 
tender, pare them, being careful to cut away all the rind; then 



VEGETABLES. 83 

quarter and remove the seeds; let the pieces lie in cold water till 
you are ready to cook them. When boiled, drain well, roash till 
smooth; season with salt, pepper and butter, and keep hot till 
served. It improves them to put a little salt in the water in 
which they are boiled. 

WINTER SQUASH. 

Wash, cut into medium sized pieces, pare and remove seeds. 
Boil till tender. Drain as dry as possible, and before mashing, let 
it stand a few minutes on the top of the stove that all the water 
may evaporate. Season with butter, salt and pepper. It requires 
more time for cookincr than summer squashes. 

BAKED WINTER SQUASH. 

Wash but do not pare. Cut into squares, remove seeds and 
bake the same length of time as potatoes. Some consider squash 
cooked in this way a good substitute for sweet potatoes. 

RAW TOMATOES. 

When tomatoes are to be. eaten raw, do not scald them — they 
are better to have the ekins removed with a sharp knife. Slice 
them and lay in a dish; they are very much improved by standing 
on ice for an hour or two before being eaten. Do not season be- 
fore placing on the table, as some prefer salt, while others like 
sugar best. 

STEWED TOMATOES. 

Select ripe tomatoes, pour boiling water over them and let them 
stand a few moments; then remove to a pan of cold water, and 
slip off the skins; cut out the core and hard part, slice, and put 
to cook in a sauce-pan; stir them occasionally; cook half an hour; 
season with salt, pepper and sugar, if liked, and add a small piece 
of butter; stir ten minutes longer. If desired, the tomatoes may 
be thickened before being served, by adding bread crumbs, or, if 
preferred, toast some pieces of bread and lay in the bottom of the 
dish in which they are to be served. Some think a small onion, 
minced, improves the flavor; others add a quarter as much green 
corn as tomatoes, and stew gently.

TOMATO FRITTERS. 

MRS. T. W. CARPENTER. 

Take one quart of stewed tomatoes, stir in one ^s^^., one small 
teaspoonful of soda, and flour enough to make as stiif as pancakes. 
Fry by dropping in hot lard. 

STUFFED TOMATOES. 

MRS. C. E. PARKER, ILL. 

Choose large and smooth tomatoes, cut out a lid, scoop out the 
seeds, and cook them with the juice twenty minutes; add an equal 
quantity of bread crumbs, or partly cooked rice, and one finely 
chopped onion to a dozen tomatoes; stew ten minutes longer; 
season with salt, pepper and butter, and a little sugar, if you like. 
Stuff the tomatoes with this, replace the lid, dust with bread 
crumbs, season as for inside and bake half an hour. 

SCALLOPED TOMATOES. 

MRS. MARY ANDREWS. 

Pour boiling hot water over the tomatoes and then peel and 
slice them. Butter a deep dish and put a layer of tomatoes upon 
the bottom; season with salt and pepper; add a layer of bread 
crumbs, another of tomatoes, seasoning as before, then another of 
bread crumbs, and proceed in this way until the dish is full, end- 
ing with bread crumbs, over which lay many little bits of butter; 
bake an hour. Add sugar to pepper and salt, if preferred. 

SALSIFY, OR VEGETABLE OYSTER, STEWED. 

Scrape the roots and drop into cold water as soon as cleaned, 
as exposure to the air causes them to turn dark. Cut into inch 
pieces; put into a stew-pan with enough boiling water to cover 
them and cook until tender. Drain off nearly all the water and 
add a cup of rich milk or cream. Stew a few minutes, rub a 
teaspoonful of flour in a lump of butter, stir it in and season with 
salt and pepper. It will be found to have a good deal of the 
oyster taste. 



VEGETABLES. 85 

SALSIFY FRIED. 

Scrape the roots and let them lie in cold water a few minutes; 
boil in salt water till tender; mash thoroughly, picking out all the 
fibres; season with butter, salt and pepper. Beat an egg and stir 
in, and if not moist enough to work out into cakes, add a little 
milk. Make into cakes an inch thick, roll in flour and fry a light 
brown. 

SALSIFY ON TOAST. 

Prepare as for stewing. Boil, and instead of draining off the 
water, add butter, salt and pepper and a little flour. Toast some 
slices of bread; lay a slice of toast and pover with salsify, then 
another slice and more of the salsify until all is used. A covered 
dish is preferable. 

SPINACH. 

MRS. DR. HOFFMAN, BEAKDSTOWN, ILL. 

Wash well; boil a few minutes in plenty of water; then dip 
into cold water, press well to free from water and chop fine. 
Stew it with plenty of butter for fifteen minutes; sprinkle with 
flour and cook a few minutes more. Then add some strong meat 
gravy in which may be the gravy of a roast. After this, it must 
not boil any more, and must be served as soon as possible. The 
dish may be ornamented with slices of hard boiled eggs. 

YOUNG TURNIPS— BOILED WHOLE. 

Pare smoothly, and lay in cold water half an hour. Put them 
in boiling water, with a tablespoonful of butter, and stew until ten- 
der; drain dry without breaking, place in a deep dish and cover 
with butter drawn in milk. Care should be taken to serve hot. 

MASHED TURNIPS. 

c . 

Peel, cut in half inch slices and lay in cold water half an hour; 
put to cook in boiling water with a little salt — cook till tender; if 
young, it will require thirty minutes to boil them, and a longer 
time for older ones. Drain well, let them stand over the fire 
a few moments for the moisture to escape and then mash; season 
with salt, pepper, butter and cream. 



86 VEGETABLES. 

ANOTHER WAY. 

Pare and quarter the turnips; then dip into a sauce pan, some of 
the liquor in which you are boiling corned beef or pork; skim off 
the grease and boil till tender. Serve hot, with the rest of your 
boiled dinner. They are apt to give the meat an unpleasant fla- 
vor if boiled in the same vessel with it.

-s^l OOD P^LOUR has a yellowish tinge, and when pressed 
^^[i'=r by the hand, retains the creases. Poor flour is not so 
r^<Sa. adhering, has a dingy look and can be blown about. 



Flour made from sprouted wheat makes a soft, running 
dough which cannot be easily moulded; it is an impossibil- 
ity to make good bread from such flour. The sifting of 
flour before using makes it lighter. 
Good yeast is as indispensable to good bread as is good flour. 
The recipes for yeast in this book will be found excellent if good 
flour is used. Yeast should be kept in a stone jug, well corked, 
or in a self-sealing glass jar; these should be scalded every time 
fresh yeast is made, sweetened with soda water, and rinsed with 
cold water. 

A little molasses always improves bread or cakes made from 
unbolted or rye flour. A little butter or lard improves cakes made 
of Indian meal, as it makes them more tender. A tablespoon 
of lard, and the same quantity of white sugar, added to the sponge 
at night, will make the bread more tender and palatable. 

Bread will keep better in a covered tin box than in anything 
else. 

CARRIE'S JUG YEAST. 

MRS. E. P. CHASE. 

Peel twelve potatoes and boil in one gallon of water, with three 
large handfuls of hops thrown in loose. When done, mash pota- 
toes through a colander; then lay a towel in the colander, and strain 
the hops; add one-half cup of brown sugar, one-half cup of mo- 
lasses, one-half cup of salt. When cool enough, put in one pint 
of yeast, and let it stand twenty-four hours before using; then 
pour into a jug, cork tight, keep in a cool place, and always shake 
well before using.

JUG YEAST 

MRS. WM. n. RAY, RUSHYILLE, ILL. 

Four large potatoes, one large handful of hops, in a bag, one 
large spoon of sugar, one large spoon of flour, one quart of water. 
Boil hops and potatoes till potatoes are done; then squeeze 
out hop-bag, mash potatoes, and add sugar and flour. When cool 
enough, put in a cup of good yeast. Keep in a cool place. 

DRY YEAST. 

MRS. LUCINDA AVRIGHT, RUSHVILLE, ILL. 

Twelve good sized potatoes, one pint of hops, one gallon of 
water, one tea-cup of dry yeast, soaked; stir in a little flour and 
let rise. Wash the potatoes clean, and boil without peeling; boil 
the hops with the potatoes, loose. When the potatoes are done, 
peel and mash; mix with a pint of flour; strain the water from 
the hops into it; when cool, stir in the yeast and let rise twenty- 
four hours; then mix with Indian meal, roll out, and cut it into 
cakes to dry. 

AN UNFAILING YEAST. 

MRS. C. H. ATKINS. • 

Put a handful of hops into a bag and drop it into two quarts 
of boiling water; while steeping, wash, peel and grate six medium 
sized potatoes; take out the hops, put in the potatoes and boil a 
few ininutes, stirring continually; add a half tea-cup of white or 
light brown sugar, the same of salt. When cool, stir in a tea-cup 
of yeast; let it rise till it becomes a mass of foam, then stir down 
and jug it tight. 

YEAST. 

MRS. J, M. OTIS. 

One large handful of hops, one dozen potatoes, one cup of su- 
gar, one-half cup of salt, one tablespoonful of ginger. Mash the 
potatoes in the water in which they are boiled, and pour into a 
jar; add the sugar, salt and ginger; steep the hops till the strength 
is gone, and add the water to this mixture till you have one gal- 
lon. When cooled to blood heat, add one cup of the same yeast. 
Keep warm from six to eight hours. When light, bottle and set 
in the cellar. 



BREAD AND YEAST. 89 

YEAST. 

MRS. W. S. PRITCHAKD. 

A double handful of hops (in a thin bag), one quart of boiling 
water, one quart of potatoes cut in small pieces. Boil the potatoes 
with the hops until thoroughly done, keeping them covered tight all 
the time. Take the potatoes out and mash well, then pour the 
boiling hop water over them; add two tablespoons of sugar, two 
of ginger, one of salt; let it stand until just warm, and add one tea- 
cup of yeast, or more. It will keep two weeks in summer and two 
months in winter. 

BREAD. 

MRS. W, S. PRITC^ARD. 

Take one pint of peeled potatoes cut in small pieces; boil 
them in one and one-half pints of water, skim out, and mash fine. 
Add four tablespoons of fine flour to the potatoes, pour over 
the potato-water and stir till smooth. When cool, add four 
tablespoons of my (Mrs. Pritchard's) yeast and a teaspoon of 
salt. Let it rise over night. In the morning, take the bread- 
bowl, filled with flour, pour one pint of boiling water in the cen- 
ter, and mix; add enough cold water to make lukewarm; then 
pour in the sponge made the night before, mix the dough soft and 
knead one-half hour. Put back in the bread-bowl and set to rise; 
when light, knead down and set to rise again; then knead into 
loaves and when light, bake in a moderate oven. This quantity 
will make four loaves. 

BREAD. 

4 MRS. J. M. OTIS. 

Mix a batter with warm water and a little salt; to each quart of 
water use one teacup of yeast. (If the weather is not very warm, do 
this at night; but if quite warm, the bread is not so sweet as if 
mixed in the morning.) When light, add flour till the dough is stiff 
— knead thoroughly, cover and let rise again. When it is again 
light, knead, and again let it stand. If this is done several times 
the bread will be of a finer texture than if put into the pans with- 
out kneading. After the dough has risen sufficiently knead into 
loaves and let rise until light, then bake in a hot oven.

BREAD. 

MRS. MILES. 

In all cases, have good, sweet yeast. You will never fail in 
bread-making by following a few general rules. On the evening 
of the day before bread is wanted, take one quart of water (warm 
or not, according to the weather), two-thirds of a cup of yeast; 
stir in flour to make a thick batter; let rise, knead it well at night 
and cover close. In the morning, it will be light; knead lightly, 
put into pans and bake when sufficiently risen. 

SALT-RISING BREAD. 

MRS. W. C. BURTON. 

In the evening, fill a pint cup half full of new milk and let it 
come almost to boiling heat; thicken with corn meal to the con- 
sistency of mush, put a sauce-plate over the cup, wrap it in flan- 
nel and put it where it will keep warm. In the morning, set the 
salt-rising in the usual way; then add the corn meal preparation, 
make rather stiff with flour and, if done right, it will rise in fifteen 
minutes. Mix the bread with sweet milk, warm and knead until 
it looks smooth. (The longer it is kneaded the whiter the bread.) 
Add one spoonful of sugar to the loaf ; mashed potatoes as 
used in the hop yeast, improve it. Graham bread can be made 
the same way by omitting the yeast. 

FRENCH ROLLS. 

MRS. J. PARMELEE. 

One pint of milk, one teacup of butter, one teacup of sugar, 
three eggs, one teacup of yeast, flour enough to knead. Set the

GRAHAM YEAST BREAD. 

MRS. J. M. OTIS. 

Prepare a batter as for fine flour bread (see Mrs. Otis' rule for 
making bread), using the same proportion of yeast to the water. 
When light, add one spoon of sugar for each quart of water, 
and mix sufficiently stiff to knead, but not so stiff as for fine flour 
bread; let it stand to rise. When light, knead and let rise again. 
When again light, knead, divide and put into pans for baking. 
Let it rise again in the pans. Graham bread requires to be baked 
a little longer and more slowly than fine flour bread.

ECONOMY CAKES. 

MRS. J. P. FOSTER. ' 

Bread that is sour can be made into good breakfast cakes. Cut 
it in small pieces, and, if not wanted for immediate use, it can be 
kept a number of weeks by drying the pieces in a moderately hot 
oven; care must be taken that it does not burn. When you wish 
to make cakes for breakfast, soak the bread over night in cold wa- 
ter; in the morning, drain off all the water, mash the bread fine, 
and to every three pints put one teaspoon of salt, three eggs, one 
teaspoon of soda dissolved in milk, one pint of wheat or rye flour; 
add sufficient milk to enable you to fry them as you would buck- 
wheat cakes. If the flour which is used is mixed over night with 
a large spoon of yeast, the eggs may be omitted.

BEST MODE OF COOKING OAT ME-AL. 

MRS. KETCHUM, CHICAGO. 

Mush. — Put one pint of oat meal to soak in warm water (just 
enough to cover it), a few hours before cooking; then put this 
mixture into boiling water, salted a little, and let it cook 
slowly for half an hour or longer. To be eaten hot or cold with 
butter and sugar or with cream and sugar, 

A Heartier Dish is made by cooking it with the water in 
which meat has been boiled, skimming off the fat and serving 
with the meat the same as a vegetable. 

Soup. — Cook meat until very tender, removing it from the 
bones; chop very fine and cook with oat meal. 

Pudding. — Take eggs, milk, sugar, raisins and cinnamon, the 
same as for other puddings. 

For the Invalid — have it thin, like gruel, and serve with sugar 
and milk, or cream if it can be* taken. In oat meal are the ma- 
terials for growth of muscle and bones and substance for the 
brain and nerves. 

CRACKED WHEAT. 

Put in a tin pail and set in a kettle of boiling water. Cover 
closely and let it boil half or three-quarters of an hour. Soak it 
previously the same as oat meal, stirring the mixture into boiling 
water. 

ANOTHER WAY. 

Prepare same as above, and boil from two to three hours.

.^ 





^N making paste, use ice water. Have the lard and but- 
ter cold and hard. Do not knead the dough, but mix it 
,^4* ^^ ^'g^tly as possible. 
^[p* One tablespoon of molasses in fruit pies is a great im- 
provement. 

PASTE. 

MRS. H. D. FOSTER. 

Two large cups of flour, one cup of water, a half cup of butter, 
a half cup of lard and a little salt. This will make two pies. To 
make crust look rich, take the white of an egg, well beaten, and 
spread it upon the pies lightly, with a feather, just before putting 
them into the oven; one egg to five pies. 

PUFF PASTE. 

MRS. J. B. STEWART. 

One pound of butter, washed and frozen, and one pound of flour; 
mix half the butter with most of the flour, and use as little (ice) 
water to mix with as possible ; roll out and put the rest of the but- 
ter on in pieces; double and roll again; then bake in a quick oven; 
pack away in tin. This makes one hundred tarts. 

CREAM PASTE. 

MRS. W. S. PRITCHARD. 

Take one pint of sour cream, buttermilk or sour milk; beat into 
it one pint of flour; then stir into it one teaspoon of finely pow- 
dered soda; add as much more flour as will be required to make 
a dough stiff enough to roll; put into it, the last thing, one even 
tablespoon of salt. The yolk of an egg, beaten very light, makes 
it richer. Good for chicken pie.

EXCELLENT SAUCE FOR BOILED RICE. 

MRS. G. R. OSGOOD. 

Beat the whites of three eggs with sufficient sugar to make them

C^KS^g SjSfiD idiKG^^. 



^[^^WLWAYS have good flour, and sift it. Be careful to have 



11 



!f fresh eggs, and beat them light. Use good sugar and 
^^ °^ sweet butter, as poor butter will give the cake a bad 
flavor. Beat cake in an earthen bowl, with a wooden spoon, 
or paddle. Have the oven at the right heat when it 
1 is ready to put in — too cold an oven will- make cake heavy. 
Wash currants (after picking them over) in a sieve set in a large 
pan of water; rub them well with the hands, changing the water 
two or three times; drain dry, then pour them on a coarse towel, 
and rub well; put back into a sieve and set out to dry. A quan- 
tity of currants can be prepared at once, and used whenever you 
wish. Raisins should be stoned before using. Citron should be 
sliced very thin for cake, and put in alternate layers with the 
dough. 

For fried cakes, dissolve the sugar in the milk, to prevent the 
cakes from absorbing the fat. In using baking powder, sift it in 
a half-cup of flour; mix well and sprinkle in the last thing. 

ICING. 

MBS. G. K. OSGOOD. 

White of one egg, nine teaspoons of sugar and one teaspoon

till the water boils out. Beat this syrup into the white of the

FROSTING. 

MKS. PARKS, GRAND HAVEN. 

I have found an improvement on the old method, which takes 
much less sugar and labor. The white of one egg is sufficient for 
a cake. Break it into a bowl; add one-half cup of sugar and 
beat till very stiff, then flavor; stir in a little corn starch and 
sugar until it is just firm enough to hold its own and spread over 
Ihe cake quickly, finishing as you go.

One cup of sugar, a half cup of butter, two cups of flour, whites 
of five eggs, two teaspoons of baking powder and analine the size 
of two grains of wheat; tie the last in a thin cloth and pour over 
it a half teaspoon of hot water. The analine can be put in one- 
half the mixture and dropped into the pan with alternate spoons 
of the white, making a marbled cake which is very ornamental. 
The effect is better to have the mixtures put together in small 
quantities. 

ANOTHER PRETTY CAKE. 

Bake white cake in three layers, with pink frosting. Cut it in 
small squares of about two inches and alternate it in the basket 
with chocolate cake made as follows: 

Bake the above gold cake in corresponding thin layers. Scrape 
fine two tablespoons of chocolate; put it into a tin cup and pour 
over it just enough hot water to dissolve it into a cream, setting it 
on the stove for a moment. Stir this into the frosting, making it 
just a pretty shade of brown. Cut this cake into diamonds. I 
always bake my thin cakes in square tin pans. Half the receipt 
for gold cake makes two thin ones. The white of one ^^'g is 
enough for one cake. The amount of chocolate given is intended 
for two.

more icing, then another layer of cake and ice the cake all over. 
This makes two large cakes.

y ^!^ spoons of cinnamon, one teaspoon of cloves, one teaspoon of 
J mace, one pound of raisins, one pound of currants and a 
fourth of a pound of citron (more fruit makes the cake hand- 
somer, but this quantity will do). Bake the cake in round pans 
with straight sides. The loaves should be one and a half inches 
in thickness after baking. 

The white cake is made as follows: One cup of butter, four 
cups of powered white sugar, two cups of sweet milk, two cups of 
corn starch mixed with the flour, four and a half cups of sifted

black cake, making the light and dark loaves of the same thick- 
ness. 

After the cake is all cold, each black loaf should be spread with 
a thick frosting: made as follows: White of one egg beaten light, 
graced rind of two and the juice of three lemons, and powdered 
sugar enough to make a thick frosting. Lay the white and black 
loaves alternately ; frost all over as you would any other loaf; be

palate.

should be made some twelve hours before wanted for use, as it 
will not jelly sooner. If in a hurry, add more gelatine.

'ill PORCELAIN kettle is the best to cook fruit in. Use 

~ fjr nice sugar for jellies and preserves. Take off the scum 

^||^^ that rises to the top in boiling fruits. In stirring fruit 

^ use a wooden spoon or j^addle. Strain jelly through a flan- 

Ij?^ nel bag. Marmalade and jam must be stirred constantly 

I while boiling. 

Before tying up fruits, cut a paper the size of the vessel, dip 

in brandy and lay on the top. If a mold forms all over this the 

fruit will keep well, but if in spots, it must be scalded. Jellies 

and preserves keep better in -small jars or glasses than in large 

ones, as frequent dipping into them causes them to ferment. 

Suggestion. — Put up jam while hot. Fruit and sugar which 
have been boiled together for some time, keep better if the pots 
into which they are poured are tied while hot. 

STEWED AND BAKED APPLES. 

MRS. J. CARPENTER. 

Pare and core some firm, acid apples, stick cloves in them, fill 
the vacancy left by the core with sugar and some thin strips of

SUGGESTION. 

MRS. HOWELL. 

While canning fruit, put a table knife all around inside of the 
jar, moving slowly, until the bubbles do not rise; then fill again 
and seal.

APPLE BUTTER. 

MES. E. P. CHASE. 

Boil twelve gallons of cider down to four; pare, core and quarter 
the apples; put them into the cider and boil them three or four 
hours. It is best to have two kettles on the stove at once so as to 
keep one filled up; as the apples boil down in one, fill from the 
other, and then keep adding fresh apples to the one you fill from, 
stirring continually or it will burn. To five gallons of the butter, 
add ten pounds of sugar and boil together one hour. Just before 
taking from the fire, put in a little ground cloves or cinnamon if 
you wish. Pour into gallon jars and seal with beef suet tried out 
and poured over hot. 

LEMON BUTTER. 

MRS. HAEKNESS. 

Three lemons, one pound of pulverized sugar, six eggs and but- 
ter the size of a walnut. Squeeze the lemons, being particular to 
use only the juice, add the sugar, the yolks of six eggs and the 
whites of four; beat well; add the butter; let it boil up and pour 
it into a dish. 

LEMON BUTTER. 

MISS S. BLANCHAED, POET B., PA. 

The grated rind and juice of one lemon, two cups of sugar, one 
cuiD of water and two eggs. Stir sugar and eggs together, put in 
the water and lemon, let it get luke warm, then strain the whole 
and boil it about a minute. Good for pudding sauce or cakes. 

CIDER APPLE SAUCE. 

MES. DE. EAWSOX. 

Take tart apples, pare and quarter them and spread on a plate 
to dry; they are better if dried only a short time, not more than 
forty- eight hours, and even less will do. Take sufficient cider 
for the quantity of sauce desired, and dilute it with water one 
half or more, if the cider is very rich and strong; set it on the 
stove and let it simmer slowly, put in a few pieces of the apple 
at a time and let them just cook through but not enough to 
break, take them out carefully and put them into a dish; continue 
this until all are cooked, then pour the juice over them.

JOHN THOMAS. 

MRS. C. H. SWEENEY. 

Plunge fine, ripe tomatoes into boiling water, skin and slice

sufficient water to keep them from burning, boil until soft, and 
rub through a colander, then take an equal weight of plums and 
tomatoes, add a pound of sugar to a pound of fruit and boil twenty 
minutes, stirring constantly. 

RASPBERRY JAM. 

MRS. HENRY SCRIBNER. 

To one pound* of currant juice take five pounds of raspberries

mash them and let them stand one hour, then add the currant 
juice and boil a half hour. Blackberry jam is made in the same 
way.

Is^: 



&N order to have good pickles you must use good vine- 
gar — pure cider or white wine vinegar is considered 
• i-vf''^*^ best. Vinegar should not be boiled in metallic vessels, 
■^lly' as the salts produced by such contact are poisonous. 
Stone-ware jars (not glazed) should be used to keep pickles 
in. In making a large quantity at a time it is best to seal 
up a part — in such cases use green glass jars. 

BRINE FOR CUCUMBER PICKLES.

water, then cover them with boiling vinegar and let it remain two 
days, then put them in jars with whole spices among them and 
cover with a nno vinegar, boiling hot, and sweetened in the pro- 
portion of a teacup of sugar to a gallon of vinegar. The vinegar 
in which the pickles are kept one year will do for \}a.Q first vinegar 
the next. Use for spices black pepper, allspice, cloves and cin- 
namon; but the pickles are good and will keep without spices. 
If the pickles are to be kept through the following summer, it is 
safer to seal them up. 

CUCUMBER PICKLES.

radish among the pickles. Use vinegar enough to cover the 
pickles; put into it a pound of brown sugar, let it scald, and pour 
over the pickles; let the bag of spices remain in the jar, and when 
ready to put away pour over a coffeecup of molasses, letting it 
settle gradually. This receipt will pickle a three gallon jar of 
cucumbers.

MRS. C. D. SPRAGUE. 

Pare and halve the pears, put four pounds of sugar to one gal- 
lon of vinegar and boil with cloves and cassia buds, pounded and 
tied in a rag. Scald the pears a little, if hard, as pouring the 
vinegar on does not soften them. 

PICKLED GRAPES. 

MRS. C. D. SPRAGUE. 

Cut bunches of not over ripe grapes and lay in a jar with grape 
leaves between the layers. Pour over the whole a cold syrup 
made as follows: One quart of vinegar, four pounds of sugar, and

hours; then scald in clear water and drain. To seven pounds of 
rind, take one quart of good cider vinegar, four pounds of sugar 
and a half pint of ginger root; put in the rind and boil till it looks 
clear; then remove the fruit to a jar and boil the liquid until it 
is a rich syrup. 

WATERMELON PICKLES. 

MRS. GRISWOLD.

COFFEE. 



'OCHA and Java are considered the best, but with care, 
good coffee can be made of cheaper kinds, as it is much 
^._ ?^ improved by age. It is best to procure a large quantity 
^^^^ of that which you have proved to be good. All coffee. 
> needs to be looked over before roasting. If roasted in a 
stove oven, let it heat gradually, that the coffee may dry 
a while, but when it begins to roast it should be browned 
quickly and stirred often to prevent burning. Kernels should be 
brittle and of a bright brown color when <lone; if allowed to get 
black the coffee will not be good; and when done should be put into 
a canister and covered up close. It is better to brown but two 
pounds at once; never grind more than is to be used at one time. 
Too great care cannot be used in cleansing the coffee-pot in which 
the coffee is made. 

TO MAKE COFFEE. 

MRS. J. P. FOSTER. 

Take half a pint of brown coffee and half a beaten egg; mix 
well together in a little cold water, then pour in a quart of boiling 
water, or stir it in boiling water in a coffee boiler. Stir from the 
sides as it boils up. Let it boil ten minutes, pour in a little cold 
water to settle it, and set it where it will keep warm and not boil. 

TO MAKE A LARGE QUANTITY OF COFFEE. 

MRS. E. P. CHASE. 

Take one and one-fourth pints of ground coffee and one egg 
to a gallon of water. This makes strong coffee. Where coffee is 
to be made in large quantities, the coffee can be put into bags, 
allowina: room for it to swell, and boiled in the water.

SUBSTITUTE FOR CREAM IN COFFEE. 

Beat an egg to a froth, add to it a piece of butter the size of a 
walnut, and turn the coffee on it gradually from the boiling pot 
into the one for the table, in which it should be previously put. 
It is diflficult to distinguish the taste from fresh cream. 

COFFEE FOR FIFTY CUPS. 

MRS. W. CARPENTER. 

Two quarts of coffee, four eggs, shells and all; mix this with two 
quarts of cold water and pour on ten quarts of boiling water. Let 
this boil five minutes. Take off and pour in one cup of cold water 
to settle it. 

TEA. 

- It is impossible to give an exact recipe for making tea. It 
varies so in strength that one must be guided by that as to the 
quantity used. The common method of making green tea is to 
pour boiling water on the leaves and let them steep without boil- 
ing for five or ten minutes. The tea-pot should be well scalded 
and the tea sent to the table hot. Some think heating the tea- 
leaves in the teapot when dry and then pouring boiling water on 
is a superior way of making tea. It only needs to stand a mo- 
ment or two before using. Black tea, being coarser than green, 
a larger quantity is required, and it is better for boiling a few 
moments. This is as much improved by cream as coffee is. 
Keep your tea in tin, close, warm and dry. 

CHOCOLATE. 

MRS. M. ANDREWS. 

Put four ounces of chocolate in a sauce-pan, with enough cold 
water to prevent burning. Let it simmer gently a few minutes.

five minutes; when nearly cold, add the whites of three eggs, well 
beaten with a half cup of flour and a half ounce of essence of 
wintergreen or of lemon. Bottle and keep in a cold place. Take 
two tablespoons of this syrup and a quarter of a teaspoon of soda 
for a tumbler of water; stir violently and drink. Use any essence 
for flavoring instead of wintergreen that you may prefer. 

GINGER POP. 

MRS. J. OARPEISTTER.

pound of wintergreen bark, one pint of yeast and water to fill the 
barrel. Ferment twelve hours and bottle. 

EFFERVESCING JELLY DRINK. 

MRS. E. P. CHASE. 

When jellies become too old or acid for the table, take one 
large spoon of jelly and two of vinegar in a tumbler, mix smooth, 
and add two-thirds of a glass of water with a fourth of a teaspoon 
of soda dissolved in it. A very pleasant drink in hot weather. 

CREAM NECTAR. 

MRS. J. PARMELEE. 

One pint of water, one pound of white sugar, one ounce of tar- 
taric acid, fifteen drops of lemon and the whites of three eggs;

bottle. Put a tablespoonful into a tumbler and fill up with water; 
add a little soda to make it foam. This is a delightful drink for 
summer.

beaten to a froth. Mix the water, sugar and acid and, when near 
boiling, add the corn starch made smooth in a little cold water; 
as it boils up have the eggs ready and stir in just after it is re- 
moved from the fire; when cold, skim and bottle for use; it may 
be flavored when bottled. Two or three large spoons of this in a 
glass of cold water, with about a fourth of a teaspoon of bi-car- 
bonate of soda, makes a pleasant, cooling drink for summer. It 
will keep some weeks in a cool place.

ENGLISH CURE FOR DRUNKENESS. 



HIS recipe comes into notoriety through the efforts of 
John Vine Hall, who had fallen into such habitual drunk- 
[t^2T^^ eness that his most earnest efforts to reclaim himself 
'(M^ proved unavailing. He sought the advice of an eminent 
Iv) physician who gave him a prescription which he followed for 
I several months, and at the end of that time had lost all de- 
sire for liquor. 
The recipe is as follows: Five grains of sulphate of iron, ten 
grains of magnesia, eleven drachms of peppermint water and one 
drachm of spirits of nutmeg; to be taken twice a day. This prep- 
aration acts as a stimulant and tonic and partially supplies the 
place of the accustomed liquor, and prevents that absolute phys- 
ical and moral prostration that follows a sudden breaking off 
from the use of stimulating drinks. 

EYE-WATER RECIPE. 

MES. C. D. REINKJNG, 

Cut a fresh hard-boiled egg into halves while hot, remove the 
yolk, fill the cavity with white vitriol, close the egg again, place 
in a vessel and cover tight to prevent the steam from escaping. 
Let it stand ten minutes, then take off the shell and strain the 
other part through a cloth. Add one teaspoon of sugar, one tea- 
spoon of salt and a gill of rain water. 

FOR A FELON.

FOR FELONS. 

Take a portion of the bark of sweet elder, or hops will do; then 
put it with some sweet cream into a cup, and boil a short time; 
then put in a lump of saltpetre twice as larg^e as a pear; let it 
slowly dry away to the consistency of a salve, which apply to the 
felon. The salt petre is the cure, but the elder bark and sweet 
cream aid in easing the pain. By putting in enough saltpetre, 
any felon can be cured in 48 hours, and the pain will cease al- 
most immediately. 

FOR SORE NIPPLES. 

MRS. E. A. C. 

Put one teaspoon of quince seed into a fourth of a glass of 
brandy. Let it stand a few hours till it forms a mucilage; then 
rub it on. It is very soothing and heals by using a few times, 

FOR SALT-RHEUM. 

MRS. D. D, B., CHICAGO, ILL. 

Get sweet fern; if it does not grow in your locality you can 
procure it at the druggist's. Steep and use it for a common drink; 
also bathe the parts affected and it will cure you. It is far better 
than any doctor's medicine. 

RING WORM. 

Put a penny into a tablespoon of vinegar, let it remain until it 
becomes green, and wash the ringworm with this two or three 
times a day. 

FOR CORNS. 

The strongest acetic acid applied night and morning, will cure

TO PREVENT COLORS FROM FADING. 

MRS. J. PARMELEE. 

.« iii5f«ay:5||^ ISSOLVE an ounce of sugar of lead in one bucket of 
ijip" Avater. Put the dress into the water and let it stay 
^"^ about a half hour; then wring it out and dry it before 
washing. Hay water cleanses and stiffens brown or buff 
linen. One large spoon of beef's gall to two buckets of 
suds, improves calicoes and prevents their fading. Make 
starch for black calicoes of coffee water to prevent any 
whitish appearance. Glue is good for stiffening calicoes. Never 
let your calicoes freeze when drying. 

To prevent calico from fading while washing, infuse three gills 
of salt into four quarts of water; put the calico in while hot and 
leave it till cold. In this way the colors are rendered permanent, 
and will not fade by subsequent washings. 

BRAN WATER. 

This is excellent for washing a delicate material without fading 
it; if not too much soiled, the article can be cleansed without soap. 
Prepare it by boiling bran in a bag in the proportion of one quart 
to a gallon of water. Let it cool, and add another gallon of 
water. This will answer for soap and starch. 

TO WASH SWISS MUSLIN. 

Dissolve one teaspoon of gum Arabic in a half pint of water and 
add it to your starch when boiling. Wash the Swiss, put it 
through the starch, and clap it till dry enough to iron. It will 
look as well as new.

CLEAR STARCHING. 

Many persons clear starch their clothes. That is, after starch- 
ing and drying, they rinse quickly through cold water. This does 
not remove the stiffness of the starch, but makes them glossier 
and more pliable. 

STARCH. 

MRS. E. A. C. 

Mix with cold water; pour on boiling water till it thickens; then 
add two teaspoons of sugar and butter the size of a nut. This 
gives a good gloss. 

STARCH POLISH. 

MKS. W. S. PEITCHART). 

Take equal parts of white wax and spermaceti; melt them to- 
gether and run into thin cakes on plates. A piece of this the size 
of a cent added to a quart of prepared starch gives a lustre to the 
clothes and prevents them from sticking. 

TO REMOVE STARCH OR RUST FROM FLAT-IRONS. 

Have a piece of yellow beeswax tied in a coarse cloth. When 
the iron is almost hot enough to use, but not quite, rub it quickly 
with the beeswax, and then witii a clean, coarse cloth. This will 
remove it entirely. 

TO REMOVE FRUIT STAINS FROM ANY WHITE GOODS. 

MRS. A. Y. EAWSON. 

Take chloride of soda and rub on the spots; wash out with clear 
water as soon as the stain disappears, to prevent the soda from 
eating the fabric. This is unfailing. For grass stains, rub fresh 
lard on the spots before washing and let them lie a little while 
that the lard may penetrate the cloth. 

TO REMOVE IRON RUST AND INK FROM WHITE 

GOODS. 

MRS. J. P. FOSTER.

264 MISCELLANEOUS RECEIPTS. 

TO PURIFY CISTERN WATER. 

MRS. CROM. BOWEN. 

A small sack of charcoal dropped into the cistern every spring, 
will purify it, and keep the water sweet and clean. 

ORRIS ROOT. 
Nibble orris root when going to singing school. 

TO REMOVE GREASE FROM COAT COLLARS. 
Wash with a sponge moistened with hartshorn and water. 

DIFFERENT USES FOR AMMONIA. 

No housekeeper should be without a bottle of spirits of ammo- 
nia, for besides its medical value, it is very desirable for house- 
hold purposes. It is nearly as useful as soap, and its cheapness 
brings it within the reach of all. Put a teaspoon of ammonia into 
a quart of warm soap-suds, dip in a flannel cloth and wipe off 
the dust and fly specks, and see how much labor you can save. 
No scrubbing will be needful. 

It will cleanse and brighten silver wonderfully. With a pint of 
suds mix a teaspoon of the spirits, dip in your silver spoons, forks, 
etc., rub them with a brush, and polish with a chamois skin. 

For washing mirrors and windows, put a few drops of ammonia 
on a piece of paper and it will readily take off every spot or finger 
mark on the glass. 

It will take out grease spots from every fabric. Put on the 
ammonia nearly clear, lay a blotting paper over the place and 
press a hot iron over it a few minutes. A few drops in water will 
clean laces and whiten them, and muslins also. 

Then it is a most refreshing agent at the toilet table. A few 
drops in a basin will make a better bath than pure water, and, if 
the skin is oily, it will remove its glossiness and disagreeable odors. 
Added to a foot bath, it entirely absorbs all obnoxious smell so 
often arising from the feet in hot weather; nothing is better for 
cleansing the hair from dandruff and dust. 

For cleansing hair and nail brushes it is equally good. Put a 
teaspoon of ammonia into a pint of warm water and shake the 
brushes through the water; when they look white, rinse them in 



MISCELLANEOUS RECEIPTS. 265 

cold water and put them in the sunshine or a warm place to dry; 
the dirtiest brushes will come out white and clean. 

For medical purposes it is unrivalled. For the headache it is a 
desirable stimulant; and frequent inhaling of its pungent odors 
will often remove catarrhal cold. There is no better remedy for 
heart-burn and dyspepsia, and the aromatic spirits of ammonia is 
especially prepared for these troubles; ten drops of it in a wine- 
glass of water is often a great relief. The spirits of ammonia can 
be take in the same way, but it is not palatable. 

AMMONIA FOR PLANTS. 

The eifect of ammonia on vegetation is beneficial. If you desire 
roses, fuschias, geraniums, etc., to become more flourishing, try it 
upon them by adding five or six drops to every pint of water you 
give them, but do not repeat the dose oftener than once in five or 
six days, lest you stimulate them too highly. 

TO REMOVE RUST FROM STEEL. 

MRS. W. . 

Cover the steel with sweet oil well rubbed on; in forty-eight 
hours use unslacked lime powdered very fine; rub it till the rust 
disappears. To prevent rust mix with fat oil varnish four-fifths 
of well rectified spirits of turpentine; apply it by means of a 
sponge and the articles will retain their brilliancy and never con- 
tract any stains of rust. 

CLEANING HAIR BRUSHES. 

MRS. J. P. FOSTER. 

Take a cup of corn meal and fill the brush, rubbing gently with 
the hand; as it absorbs the grease and dirt shake it out, and use 
fresh meal till the brush is thoroughly cleaned. This is better 
than ammonia, as there is no water to injure or loosen the back 
of the brush. 

FOR CLEANING HAIR. 

MRS. MARIA LAIRD. 

Make a thick suds with castile soap and one pint of soft water; 
add one 'd^'g well beaten, two tablespoons of ammonia and two 
teaspoons of pulverized borax. Bottle it; pour a little on the 
hair and rinse it ofi" with clean water. 



266 MISCELLANE O US RE CEIPTS. 

TO PRESERVE AND STRENGTHEN THE HAIR. 

MRS. J. P. FOSTER. 

One ounce of bi-carbonate of soda, two drams of tincture of 
cantharides, two ounces of spirits of rosemary, and a half pint 
of rosewater. Mix the bi-carbonate of soda with the rosewater, 
and add the other ingredients. Apply it with a sponge, rubbing 
it well into the roots of the hair until a lather is produced; then 
rinse with water, and dry on a coarse towel. 

TO CLEAN MARBLE. 

MRS. W. . 

Make Spanish whiting into a paste by moistening with water in 
which a piece of washing soda is dissolved; spread in a piece of 
flannel and rub it well on the marble, repeating the process. It 
should be washed off with soap and water and the marble after- 
wards polished with a soft duster. 

CLEANSING VARNISHED PAINT. 

In cleansing paint which has been varnished there is nothing 
better than weak tea. All the tea leaves from several drawings 
should be saved and boiled over early in the morning of the paint 
cleansing day; if boiled in an old tin pail or pan, the tea can be 
easily strained off for use. Wet a flannel in it and wipe the oak 
grained paint and you will be surprised at its brightness. No 
soap is needed and no milk. The tea is the most capital deter- 
gent ever invented. Wipe the paint with a soft cloth; you will 
find that very little elbow grease is needful. White varnished 
paint is cleansed as rapidly as the grained. 

SOLUTION FOR CLEANSING SILVER. 

MRS, W. S. PRITCHARD. 

Two quarts of rain water, two ounces of cyanuret of potash, 
one ounce of alcohol, one half ounce of Glauber's salts, one half 
ounce of blue stone pulverized, one ounce of ar. water spirits of 
ammonia; shake well before using. Before you begin to clean 
3'our silver, have ready a basin of hot soap suds and a basin of 
clean hot water. Tie a sponge on the end of a stick, then pour a 
small quantity of the solution into a bowl, dip the sponge into the 
mixture and apply to the article of silver, rubbing it over quick- 



MISCELLANEOUS RECEIPTS. 267 

ly, (to avoid streaks), wash the silver in the soap suds, then rinse 
in the clear water and dry thoroughly with a soft cloth. As the 
solution is a rank poison, avoid getting it into the spouts of coifee 
pots or any place where it cannot be easily removed. It is best 
to pour out but a small quantity of the mixture at a time as it 
is very volatile. 

TO MEND CHINA. 

Take a very thick solution of gum arable in water, and stir in 
plaster of Paris until the mixture becomes of the proper consist- 
ency. Apply it with a brush to the fractured edges of the china, 
and stick them together. In three days the article cannot be 
broken in the same place. The whiteness of the cement renders 
it doubly valuable. 

WASHING WINDOWS. 

MRS. CHAS. H. GETCHELL. 

Wash the dressing from a new chamois skin, it will then be 
found very convenient for washing window and picture glass and 
mirrors, using clean, warm rain-water. Wring out dry and wipe 
the glass after washing, and it will need no further polishing. 
When done using wash clean and hang up to dry. With care 
one skin will last a long time. 

PENNYROYAL AND POTASH. 

If mosquitoes or other bloodsuckers infest our sleeping-rooms 
at night, and we uncork a bottle of the oil of pennyroyal, these 
animals will leave in great haste, nor will they return so long as 
the air in the room is loaded with the fumes of tha.t aromatic herb. 
If rats enter the cellar, a little powdered potash, thrown in their 
holes, or mixed with meal and scattered in their runways, never 
fails to drive them away. Cayenne pepper will keep the buttery 
and storeroom free from ants and cockroaches. If a mouse makes 
an entrance into any part of your dwellings, saturate a rag with 
Cayenne, in solution, and stuff it into the hole, which can then be 
repaired with either wood or mortar. No rat or mouse will eat 
that rag for the purpose of opening communications with a depot 
of supplies. — Scientific American. 



368 MISCELLANEOUS RECEIPTS. 

CHAPPED HANDS. 

Take common starch and grind it with a knife until it is re- 
duced to the smoothest powder. Take a tin box and fill it with 
starch thus prepared, so as to have it continually at hand for use. 
Then every time the hands are taken from the suds, or dish-water, 
rinse them thoroughly in clean water, wipe them, and while they 
are yet damp, rub a pinch of the starch thoroughly over them, 
covering the whole surface. We know many persons formerly 
afflicted with hands that would chap until the blood oozed from 
many minute crevices, completely freed from the trouble by the 
use of this simple remedy. 

To rub the hands thoroughly, when damp, with wheat bran 
will have the same effect as the starch. It is also an excellent 
remedy for tetter on the hands — will stop the itching at once and 
effect a speedy cure. 

TO DESTROY MOTHS IN CARPETS. 

MRS. E, P. CHASE. 

Wring a coarse towel out of clean water, spread it smoothly over 
the carpet and iron with a hot iron changing the iron often; re- 
peat on all parts of the carpet suspected of having moths. It is 
not necessary to press hard. The color of the carpet will not be 
injured and the moths will be destroyed by the steam from the 
hot iron. 

GOOD CEMENT. 

Alum and plaster of Paris well mixed with water, and used in 
a liquid state, will form a very useful cement. It will be found 
quite handy for many purposes. It forms a very hard composi- 
tion, and for fixing the brasses, etc., on lamps, nothing could be 
better. 

TO PREVENT A DOOR FROM CREAKING. 

Rub on the hinges a bit of soap, or two or three drops of ma- 
chine oil.

One of the most essential points in making Cakes or Fancy Pastry is to be sure 
and get a good article of Baking powder. TONE Bro.'s BAKING POWER is used by 
all the Hotels of the City, and is pronounced by hundreds of Cooks throughout the 
State, to be the healthiest and best in the market. 

It contains no Hartshorn, Ammonia, Tartaric Acid, Alum, Terra Alba, or any of 
those adulterations used in cheap Baking powder.

MANUFACTURED BY THE 






The wants of the people demand the finest and best goods in the market; and to 
this end, I shall endeavor to furnish Standard Goods. It is well known among deal- 
ers that in Baking Powder, Canned Fruits and Flavoring Extracts, there are two or 
more grades manufactured by the same firm — especially is this true of Baking Pow- 
der — in which cheap and worthless ingredients are used in compounding the lower 
grades. I deal only in Standard Goods, making a specialty of Price's, Royal, Dool- 
ey's, and Tone Brothers'; while in 

1 handle Curtis Brothers' & Mack's which have no superior in the market. In 

Burnett's, which are not excelled in the World, constantly on hand. 

In fine drawing Teas, I make a specialty, buying direct from importers in Boston 
and New York. Lovers of this delicious beverage will find in this House, all grades 
of Oolong, Young Hyson, Gunpowder, Japan, &c., from the cheapest to the best 
found in the market. 

St. Louis and Quincy Flour, the joy and pride of all lovers of good bread, on 
hand and fully warranted. 
Soliciting a continuance of patronage, 

Respectfully,
