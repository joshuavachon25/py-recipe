PREFACE. 



At the late Vienna Exhibition, Mr. de Mosenthal, in 
his capacity of Commissioner for the South African 
Colonies, exhibited a complete assortment of ostrich 
feathers supplied from tame birds, together with a model 
of an artificial incubator. This circumstance gave rise 
to so many applications for information on the subject 
of ostrich-farming, as to suggest the desirability of pub- 
lishing some account of this new industry which should 
furnish answers to the various inquiries made of him. 

It was at first intended to deal solely with the his- 
tory, development, and present condition of ostrich- 
farming, but on consideration it was thought that such 
a treatise would be scarcely complete without some refer- 
ence to the natural history of the ostrich and its allies, 
more especially as it is not to the African bird alone 
that the world of fashion is indebted for the so-called 
" ostrich feathers." 

The opportunity seemed a good one for attempting a 
monograph of the ostrich family, since no complete 
account of these singular birds has been hitherto pub- 
lished. Hence the origin of the first part of our work ; 



V PREFACE, 

and thus what was originally intended to have been 
little more than a pamphlet has, by a "process of 
evolution," become a volume I It may be confidently 
stated that no pains have been spared to make it as 
complete as possible, and from the "List of Works 
and Articles quoted or referred to," some idea may 
be formed of the labour which has been entailed in its 
preparation. 

In oflFering to the public the result of our united 
efforts, we beg to tender our acknowledgments to those 
who have rendered us valuable assistance. 

To the Zoological Society of London we are indebted 
for permission to make use of several appropriate wood 
engravings from the " Proceedings " of the Society, 
which will be found at pp. 56, 86, 93, loi, 104, 108, 
III, 115, and 116. 

We desire to express our great obligations to Her 
Majesty's Legations in Morocco, Algeria, Barbary, 
Egypt, and Buenos Ayres, and to his Excellency the 
Governor of French Senegal, for the valuable reports 
which will be found in the Appendix. 

To Commander Cameron, E.N., C.B., for an interest- 
ing note on the ostrich in Central Africa, to M. F. Goy 
of Paris, and M. Gros of Paris and Cairo, for their 
reports on the ostrich-feather trade and ostrich-farming 
in Egypt, and to M. Carel of Havre for much useful 
information on the feather trade in La Plata, our thanks 
are also due, and must here be recorded.

OSTRICHES AND OSTRICH- FARMING. 



INTRODUCTION. 

OatricheB — Their position in a ByBteinatio classification of birds — The 
respects in wliicli tiiey differ from all other birds — The primary 
divisions of the order to which thsy belong, StruthionidcE and Aptcry- 
gidm — The five existing genera, Strulhio, Shea, Camariui, Ummmis, 
and Apteryx — Table of epeciea — The natural history of the majority 
little known — Scope and object of the present volunie. 

The Struthious or ostrich-like birds differ so materially 
in their atrueture from all other existing forms in the 
class AvES, that, according to the best authorities, in 
any system of classification they should be regarded 
as forming a distinct and separate order. 

Professor Husley, in his "Introduction to the Classi- 
fication of Animals" (1867, p. 104), considers that the 
class Aves is divisible into three orders — ( i )The SAXJRoiLiE, 
or lizard-tailed birds, of which only a single fossil form, 
Archaiopten/x, is known ; (2) the Eatit^, or Struthi- 
ous birds, characterised by the possession of a sternum 
or breastbone which is without a keel, and hence 
resembles a raft {ratis) ; and (3) the Carinat^e, com- 
prehending all other existing birds which liavc a keel 
(carina) to the sternum, more or less developed. 

It ia with the second of these orders, the RatitvB, 



2 INTRODUCTION. 

that we have now to deal ; and although it might be 
proper throughout these pages to confine attention 
solely to this order, it will possibly conduce to a better 
understanding of the particular respects in which the 
ostriches differ from all other birds, if we digress for a 
moment, at starting, to consider the characters which 
distinguish each of the three orders abovenamed. 

I. The Saurde^, so far as at present known, are 
represented by a single fossil form, Archteoptert/x, which 
was discovered in r85i, by Andreas Wagner, in the 

lithographic slate of Solenhofen in Bavaria, belonging 
to the Oolitic series. The unique specimen of this bird 
ia preserved in the British Museum. It was about the 
size of a rook, Corvus frugilegus, and along with the 
greater portion of the skeleton, impressions of many of 
its feathers, particularly the quills, are plainly visible. 
Its most obvious peculiarity is the presence of a long 
lizard-like tail, composed of twenty vertebrse, from each 
of which springs a pair of well-developed rectrices, or 
tail-feathers. A scarcely less remarkable feature is that 
afforded by the extremity of the wings, where it would 
appear there was a free digit, answering to the pollex. 
The many reptilian characters of this singular form 
cannot here be noticed, though their value must be 
fuUy admitted; but since the appearance of Professor 
Owen's description of the specimen {Phil, Trans, 1863, 
p. 33) no one has hesitated to regard it as a true bird, 
although one which exhibits an extraordinary dissimi- 
larity from all other known members of the class.*

1875. Art, "Birds," p. ; 



INTRODUCTION. 3 

II. The Eatit*, comprehending the Struthious or 
o9trieh-like birds, differ from all others in the combina- 
tion of several peculiarities. Not requiring their winga 
for the purpose of flight or for movement through the 
water, the sternum or breastbone is destitute of the 
normal keel, which in other birds serves for the attach- 
ment of the pectoral muscles, and ossifies only from 
lateral and paired centres; the long axes of the adjacent 
parts of the scapula and coracoid are parallel or iden- 
tical ; certain of the cranial bones have characters very 
unlike those possessed by the next order^ — the vomer, 
for instance, being broad posteriorly, and generally inter- 
vening between the basi-sphenoidal and the palatals and 
pterygoids ; the barbs of the feathers are disconnected ; 
there is no inferior larynx ; and the diaphragm is better 
developed than in other birds. 



III. The CarinatjE comprise all other existing birds. 
The sternum possesses more or less of a keel, and ossifies 
from a median centre in that keel as well as from lateral 
paired centres. The long axes of the coracoid and scapula 
meet at an acute or (as in Didus and Ocydromus) at 
a slightly obtuse angle, while usually the vomer is 
comparatively narrow, and allows the pterygoids and 
palatals to articulate directly with the basi-sphenoidal 
rostrum." 



Although the members of the order RatiUs now exist-

4 INTRODUCTION. 

ing on the earth's surface are but few in number, there 
18 reason to believe that at a comparatively recent geo- 
graphical epoch they were in some countries numerous. 
"With the exception of the ostrich," says Mr. "Wallace)' 
"which has spread northward into the PalEearctic region, 
the Struthious birds, living and estinet, are confined to 
the Southern Hemisphere, each continent having its 
peculiar forms. It is a remarkable fact that tlie two 
most nearly allied genera, Strutliio and lUiea, should be 
found in Africa and South Temperate America respec- 
tively. Equally remarkable is the development of these 
large forms of wingless birds in Australia and the 
adjacent islands, and especially in New Zealand, where 
we have evidence which renders it probable that about 
twenty species recently co-existed. This points to the 
conclusion that New Zealand must not long since have 
formed a much more extensive land, and that the 
diminution of its area by subsidence has been one of 
the causes, and perhaps the main one, in bringing about 
the extinction of many of the larger species of wingless 
birds. The wide distribution of the Struthiones may, 
as already suggested/ be best explained by supposing 
tbem to represent a very ancient type of bird, de- 
veloped at a time when the more specialised carnivor- 
ous mammalia had not come into existence, and pre- 
served only in those areas which were long free from 
the incursions of such dangerous enemies. The dis- 
covery of Struthious remains in Europe in the Lower 
Eocene only supports this view; for at this time 
camivora were few and of generalised type, and had 
probably not acquired sufficient speed and activity to

INTRODUCTION. s 

enable them to exterminate powerful and quick-run- 
ning terrestrial birds. It is, however, at a much more 
remote epoch that we may expect to find the remains 
of the earlier forms of this group ; while these Eocene 
birds may perhaps represent that ancestral wide-spread 
type which, when isolated in remoter continents and 
islands, became modified into the American and African 
ostriches, the emeus and cassowaries of Australia, the 
Dinornis and Epyornis of New Zealand," 

Confining attention to recent species, they appear to 
constitute two very distinct families. 

The first of these, the Struthionida, or Ostriches, 
embraces the largest, and, in some respects, the moat 
mammal-like of the whole class of birds ; in the other, 
the Apterygidw, or Kiwis, the species are of small size, 
and present in some respects almost reptilian characters. 
The order RatitcB thus comprises two of the most 
abnormal types of the whole class, which nevertheless 
are to a certain extent allied by unmistakable points 
of resemblance. 

The principal characters whereby the five existing 
genera of the RcUitce may be distinguished may be set 
down as follows •} — 

Family I. — Sthuthiohidj:. 

Bill short, Bttaight, robuat, and much depressed, rounded and luigiii- 
cnlate at the tip; nostrils longitudinal and bnsalj eyes large, with well- 
developed eyelashes ; wings furnished with ivaring plnmes ; l^s Extremelj 
rohnat; toea two or three, directed anteriorly. 

L Struthionika. Feathers with a single shaft; wings feathered. 
I, Head and neck partiully bare, or scantily covered with 

down; body terminated byadrooping tail; toes two, Strutkio. 



' This scheme is an amplification of tliat proposed by Mr. Solater in 
his memoir on Struthioiis birds, published in the "Transactions" of the 
Zoological Society for 1862.

On looking at this list, it will be seen that the ostrich, 
whose history and domestication form the special subject 



INTRODUCTION. 7 

of the present work, is really only one of a large number 
of species to which it is nearly allied, and although in a 
book devoted to "Ostriches and Ostrich-FarmLng " it 
might appear superfluous to treat of any but the African 
bird, there are many reasons why it has seemed to ua 
desirable to refer at some length to the so-called ostriches 
of other countries. 

In the first place, the natural history of these large 
birds is very little known to the general public. The 
existence of many of them has only been discovered 
within the last few years, and the published accounts of 
their appearance, haunts, and habits are both fragmen- 
tary and scattered. In the next place, it is not to the 
African ostrich alone that the world of fashion is in- 
debted for feathers. A considerable number of plumes 
firom the South American rheas find their way into the 
English and foreign markets ; and although mufls and 
collarettes from the Australian and other cassowaries 
are not yet within reach of the fair votaries of fashion, 
we know that amongst the natives of Queensland, and 
doubtless in other parts of the antipodes, a cassowary 
akin is held in considerable estimation as an article of 
dress. 

Again, there are more reasons than one why these 
large birds may be usefully domesticated or acclimatised. 
Although hitherto the object of " ostrich-farming " has 
been to furnish plumes to the feather-trade at a large 
profit, it may well come to pass, seeing the present 
prices charged for beef and mutton, that ostrich-meat 
may one day form an important item in our food supply. 

We do not mean to assert that people will be found 
to prefer such diet when other food can be obtained at 
reasonable cost, but looking to the success which has 




B INTRODUCTIOlt. 

attended the breeding and rearing of the ostrich in 
South Africa, Algeria, and, oq a smaller scale, in Spain, 
France, and Italy, the question not/unnaturally arisea, 
whether it might not be worth while to introduce these 
birds on English farms, with a view to rear them like 
turkeys for the table. Once imported, their keep is not 
expensive, and the meat is said to be palatable, and in 
flavour not unlike young beef. From a gastronomic 
point of view, a domesticated bird, after being fed on 
clover, lucerne, and grain, far excels in tenderness and 
flavour a wild-caught bird, which has been subsisting on 
such scanty and unnutritious fare as may be picked up 
in an African desert. But upon this point we shall have 
occasion later to offer some further remarks. 

For the reasons above stated, and before proceeding 
to the special subject of ostrich-farming, we propose to 
present the reader with some account of the various 
species of ostrich-like birds with whose existence wo arc 
acquainted, pointing out their peculiarities of colour, 
form, and structure, the countries in which they are 
respectively found, with such details of their haunts 
and habits as we have been able to collect from authentic 
sources. And first it will be proper to deal with the 
typical species.

a short, broad, and depressed bill, a long and muscular 
neck, a robust body with wings incapable of flight, 
extremely muscular thighs and stout tarsi and feet, the 
latter having only two toes of unequal length directed

anteriorly, the soles of wliich are furmshed with pads 
or cushions eapecially adapted to the bird's mode of 
life. 

When young, the ostrich is clothed with a coarse 
mottled plumage of dark brown and yellowish white, 
which colours in the male, as the bird becomes older, 
change respectively to black and pure white boldly con- 
trasted, and in the female to dusky grey. In the young 
the neck is bare, in the mature bird covered with short 
down. 

The feathei-s which ultimately become so valuable in 
trade are plucked from the wings and tail, and are 
especially characterised by haviug the quill exactly 
in the centre of the feather, while in other birds it is 
a little to one side, causing the webs on each side to be 
of unequal width. 

The antiquity of the ostrich aa a species is evi- 
denced by the frequent mention made of it both in 
Scripture and in history. But it must be observed 
that as regards Scripture and the passages therein con- 
tained which are supposed to relate to the ostrich, com- 
mentators are not agreed, inasmuch as the Hebrew 
name ycCanah is rendered indifferently " ostrich " and 
"owL" The reader, therefore, is left to determine the 
species rather by the context and the allusions which 
are made to the habits of the bird to which reference is 
made. 

Canon Tristram, who has brought to bear on the sub- 
ject the knowledge of a naturalist combined with that of 
a Hebrew echolai", has thus written upon the ostrich in 
Scripture :' —

THE OSTRICH IN SCRIPTURE. 



" The ostrich {Slruthio camelus) is mentioned in Scrip- 
ture more frequently than would appear from the read- 
ing of our version. Three Hebrew words apply to it 
which are otherwiae translated iu our test, though 
generally, ' ostrich * is supplied in the margin. The 
name by which it ia most frequentlyexpressed is 'ya'anah' 
or ' bath haya'anah,^ i.e., ' greediness,' or 'daughter of 
greediness' (or 'of shouting'). Our Bible reads 'owl/ 
excepting in Lam. iv. 3, where ya'enim is rightly ren- 
dered ' ostriches.' Another word, rdndn, is applied to 
the ostrich in Job xxzix. 13, where our translators have 
rendered it ' peacock.' ' Gavest thou the goodly wings 
unto the rendnim ? ' where the ostrich is undoubtedly 
intended, while the word translated ' ostrich ' in the 
same verse is ' notseh,'' the Hebrew for ' feathers.' 

" The first mention of the ostrich in Scripture ia in 
the list of unclean birds iu Lev. xi. 16, Deut. xiv. 16, 
where our version reads ' the owl.' It was, aa might be 
expected from hia residence in the Eastern desert, 
familiar to the patriarch Job, who refers to various 
points in its economy, some of them true, and others 
founded only on the popular beliefs which hold even to 
this day among Orieutals. Thus, ' I went mourning 
without the sun ; I stood up and I cried in the congre- 
gation. I am a brother to dragons, and a companion to 
ostriches' [owls, marg.]— Job xxx. 28, 29. 

" It ia the hoarse complaining cry by night to which 
the patriarch compares his own sorrowing lamentations 
under the visitation of God. The same simile occurs in 
Micah i. 8 : 'I will wail and howl ; I will go stripped 
and naked; I will make a wailing like the dragons and 
mourning as the ostriches ' [owls, marg.] 

" In the reply of the Lord to Job, the habits of the 



THE OSTRICH. 



ostrich are thus set forth, 'G-avest thoa the goodly wings 
unto the ostriches? or winga and feathers unto the 
ostrich, which leavoth her eggs in the earth, and 
warmeth them in dust, and forgetteth that the foot may- 
crush them, or that the wild beast may break them ? 
She is hardened against her young ones, as though they 
were not hers : her labour is in vain without fear ; because 
God hath deprived her of wisdom, neither hath He im- 
parted to her understanding. What time she lifteth up 
herself on high, she scorneth the horse and his rider.' — 
Jobxxxix. 13-18. 

"Here we find mention made of the beauty of its 
plumes, of its habit of leaving its eggs on t!je surface, 
of batching them in the heat of the sand, of its desertion 
of its young, of its reputed stupidity, and of its extra- 
ordinary fleetness. The belief that the ostrich neglected 
its young is nsed also as an illustration by Jeremiah : 
' Even the sea-monsters draw out the breast ; they give 
suck to their young ones ; the daughter of my people 
is become cruel, like the ostriches in the wilderness.' — 
Lam. iv. 3. 

" The other passages in which the ostrich is men- 
tioned refer to its inhabiting the most desolate and 
lonely places. Of Babylon it is foretold, ' Wild beasts 
of the desert shall lie there ; and their houses shall be 
full of doleful creatures ; and ostriches shall dwell 
there, and satyrs shall dance there ' (Isa. xiii. 21). Of 
Idumsea, ' It shall be an habitation of dragons, and a 
court for ostriches ' (ch. xxxiv. 13), Again of Babylon, 
' The wild beasts of the desert, with the wild beasts of 
the islands, shall dwell there, and the ostriches ' (A. V. 
' owls ') ' shall dwell therein : and it shall be no more 
inhabited for ever; neither shall it be dwelt in from 



THE OSTRICH IN HISTOR Y. 



generation to generation ' (Jer. 1. 39). In the prophecy 
of the universal extension of the Church in the latter 
days it is said, 'I will even make a way in the wilder- 
ness and rivers in the desert. The beast of the field 
shall honour me, the dragons and the ostriches,' — Isa. 
xliii. ig, 20." 

To trace the earliest mention of the ostrich in history, 
and the various allusions to this bird which may be 
found in the pages of successive historians, would re- 
quire more time and space than ia here at our disposal. 
SufSce it to say, that the monuments and inscriptions of 
the ancient Egyptians, and the accounts of Greek and 
Roman authors, all point to the antiquity of the ostrich 
as a species, and to the general, if not intimate, 
acquaintance with the bird and its habits which pre- 
vailed even at the date of these early records. The 
elegance of the feathers, no doubt arising from their 
Blender shafts and disunited webs, has led to their being 
prized in all ages. 

We ai'e informed by Professor Julius Oppert, that 
amongst the Assyrian inscriptions at Nineveh ia one 
relating to a large bird named Afizat, which he con- 
siders to be the ostrich. 

Professor Masp^ro, the well-known Egyptologist, has 
been good enough also to communicate the fact that 
ostrich feathers are frequently mentioned in the Egyptian 
hieroglyphics under the name shoo. He adds, that a 
picture of the ostrich itself has been found in a sepul- 
chral chamber at Thebes of the 18th dynasty, which, 
according to Dr. Oppert, must be contemporary with 
Moses, The mention of the ostrich in other Egyptian 
monuments is confirmed by Professor Lepsius of Berlin, 
and it would seem that an ostrich feather was regarded 




14 THE OSTRICH. 

by the Egyptians as a symbol of justicej the webs being 
of equal width or equally balanced on each side of the 
shaft.' 

Pausanias relates (x. 31) that the Egyptian queen 
Arsinoe, who lived some time before the celebrated 
Cleopatra, had her statue erected on Helicon, in which 
she was represented as riding on an ostrich. 

Herodotus (Melpom. 175, 192) refers to a custom 
amongst a certain desert tribe in Lybia of making 
garments and shields from ostrich skins ; while Strabo 
(Georg. vi, 4) describes a race of " Struthopbages," or 
ostrich-eaters, who also made coverings and dresses 
from the skin of this bird.^ 

But although the ostrich is so frequently mentioned 
by ancient historians, there is no evidence, so far as we 
are aware, that its plumes were ever worn as ornaments 
in ancient times hy ladies. The fact is, bonnets were 
unknown, the fair princesses being always veiled, and at 
the royal levees they were not permitted to appear. 
Warriors, however, wore ostrich plumes in their helmets 
from a very early date. In the comedy of " Acharnenses," 
which was represented in the theatre of Bacchus at 



1 HorapnllouiB Niloi-~Horua Apollo Ilieroglypliica. Eilidit Conradus 
Leemanua (1825), p. 113. 

Captain Burton, in his " First FootstepB in East Africa " (p. 94.), aaya : — 
" Amongst tlie old Egyptians the ostrich featlier was the symbol of truth. 
The Somal call it 'Bal,' the Arabs 'Hish ;' it ia universally used here as 
the aign and symbol of victory. Generally the vhite feather only is stuck 
in the hair ; the Eesa are not particular in naing black when they can pro- 
cure no other. All the clajia wear it in the back-hair, but each hoa ita own 
Tulea ; some make it a standard decoration, others discard it after the first 
few days. The leiimed have an aversion to the cuatom, stigmatising it as 
pagan and idolatiaus ; the vulgar look upon it aa the highest mark of 

See also Aristotle, De Part, Anim. iv. 12. 




GREEK AND ROMAN ACCOUNTS. 



Athens, B.C. 425, Aristophanes depicted a general Citlled 
Lamachon, who carried two beautiful white oatrieh 
feathers in his helmet ; while both the Greek Theo- 
phrastes (Hist. Plant, iv. 5) and the Roman Pliny 
clearly indicate that ostrich feathers were thus used in 
their day. 

In the gorgeous public spectacles in which many of 
the Roman emperors used to delight, the ostrich played 
a conspicuous part ; and it seems that domesticated 
birds were occasionally used for riding purposes by 
Eoman ladies of noble birth. 

In our own country, during the fourteenth and 
fifteenth centuries, ostrich plumes were worn in black 
velvet caps by the nobility. 

Three white ostrich feathers form the well-known 
badge of the Prince of Wales, and, according to tradition 
were assumed from the circumstance of Edward the 
Black Prince having plucked an oatiich plume from 
the helmet of John of Luxembourg, King of Bohemia, 
who fell by his hand at the battle of Cressi. There 
is no doubt, however, that ostrich feathers were 
long previously assumed as the badge of the Plan- 
tagenets. 

The present well-known device of the three feathers 
within a prince's coronet were first introduced, it is 
said, by Prince Henry, the eldest son of James I. 

But to come to the natural history portion of the 
subject. 

Whether there is more than one species of ostrich in 
Africa is a question which has puzzled naturalists not 
a little, Mr, Sclater in the " Transactions of the Zoolo- 
gical Society " (iv, p. 354) has pointed out certain 
features which he considered sufficient to distinguish 



1 6 THE OSTRICH. 

the ostrich of North Africa from that of the South ; ^ 
and as the name Struthio camelus was given by 
Linnaeus to the ostrich of S3Tia and Arabia, with 
which the ostrich of North Africa is supposed to be 
identical, Mr. Gurney proposed (Ibis, i86S, p. 253) that 
the South African form should be designated Struthio 
av^tralis} 

Andersson goes even further than this, and states 
that in his opinion there are two, if not three, species of 
ostrich in South Africa alone. In his " Birds of Da- 
maraland"^ {p. 251) he says: 

" Many naturalists are of opinion that the North 
African ostrich is distinct from that of South Africa ; 
but, from an early date in my wanderings, I suspected 
that there was more than one species of ostrich indi- 
genous to Southern Africa, though it was only in 1866 
that I had the means and the necessary time to verify 
my surmises. 

" I am now able to state that there are two distinct 
kinds of ostrich in Damaraland. The first species 
is that which is so well known throughout Southern 
Africa, in which the male bird is black, with white 
tail and wings, whilat the female is of a greyish colour. 
Of the second species, which is quite new to science, 
I have not an entire specimen by me so as to enable 
me to produce an accurate description of the whole 
bird ; still I possess sufficient data to be able to vouch

for the correctness of my statement ; for, aa I write, 
three skins {or rather portions of skins) are lying before 
me, consisting of two adulta, male and female, and a 
young bir<l apparently al>out half-grown. The male 
bird does not appear to differ from the well-known 
South African species, except in size, being larger ; but 
the greatest specific difference lies with the female and 
the young, and more especially with the former, which 
is jet-black like the cock bird. The young is of a sooty 
brown, the feathers, which are narrow and come to an 
acute point, being tipped with light brown ; the tail 
similar, but interspersed with a few grey or greyish 
white feathers ; the wings Uke the tail, but of a softer 
texture ; the thighs and neck white. The egg of this 
species is said to be larger than that of the ordinary 
one. This bird seems to be pretty commonly dis- 
tributed over the boundless wastes and plains of both 
Great Namaqua and Damaraland, and herds with the 
common species as well as in separate flocks, 

" Many of the native hunters also speak of a third 
species of ostrich, which they characterise by some very 
marked distinctions : thus, for instance, I am assured 
that it has a narrow but conspicuous bar across the back 
or rump, and a double row of quills on each wing, also 
that the colour is brownish grey in both sexes ; never- 
theless, I mention it here, more for the purpose of draw- 
ing the attention of naturalists to the subject than from 
any personal belief in its existence as a third distinct 
South A&ican species." 

Referring to this passage, Mr. J. H. Guruey says : ' — - 
" I am not able to offer any opinion as to how far Mr, 




i8 



THE OSTRICir. 



Andersson was correct in believing that more tlian one 
race of oatrich exists in Southern Africa ; but tliat the 
ordinary South African ostrich, for which I proposed 
the speeifie name ausiralis in the ' Ibis ' for 1868, p. 253, 
differs from the true Struthio camelus of North Africa, 
I cannot doubt. 

" Mr. A. D. Bartlett, the experienced and observant 
superintendent of the gardens of the Zoological Society 
of London, informs me that the skin which is visible on 
the thighs and other bare parte of the Northern ostrich 
is always flesh-coloured, whilst in the Southern ostrich 
it is invariably bluish, excepting the angle of the gape, 
which is flesh-coloured, as are also the cere and the 
scutellations of the tarsi and feet, 

" Mr. Bartlett is also of opinion that the average 
height of the Southern is somewhat greater than that 
of the Northern ostrich, and that in the male of the 
Southern race the black portions of the plumage are 
deeper in colour than in the male of the Northern bird," 

Canon Tristram, writing on the ornithology of Northern 
Africa,^ says that a considerable difference is apparent in 
the eggs of the Northern and Southern ostrich, and ha 
thus describes it : — 

" The egg of the North African ostrich seems to differ 
decidedly from that of the Cape bird. I have seen 
hundreds of specimens, and always found them rather 
larger ^ than the Southern eggs which we generally see 
in England, and quite smooth, with an ivor}', polished 



' "The IbiB," i860, p. 74. 

' An egg received by Mr. de Mosenthal from Algeria in February 1876 is 
rather imatler than one received at the game time from the Cape ; but the 
ibrraer is perfectly smooth and polished, wiiile the latter baa the surface of 



the ahell roughly punctured all o' 



ITS GEOGRAPH]CAL RANGE. 

surface, and free from any punctures. Until I found 
the eggs myself, I was under tbe impression that they 
might be polished by the Arabs; but this is a mis- 
take." 

Mr. P. L. Sclater, in the memoir before referred to,^ 
speaks of the eggs of the Southern ostrich as being 
smoother than those of the Northern bird ; but this is 
doubtless a lapsus memoricB, as the series of eggs on 
■which the observation was made, and which are still in 
the possession of Mr, Bartlett, show that the contrary 
is the fact, and that Canon Tristram's statement is 
correct.* 

The more recent investigations in zoology, however, of 
Dr, Blasius, jun., have materially shaken the belief in the 
importance of these characters as regards the difference 
of species.^ Indeed, notwithstanding the opinions of 
the competent naturalists just quoted, it seems highly 
probable that the differences of size and colour to which 
they refer are such aa may be reasonably accounted for 
on the score of age, sex, and that individual variation 
which, induced doubtless by difference of food and 
climate, has been observed in many other species of 
birds and mammals. Believing this to be the case, 
we have no hesitation in expressing the opinion 
that there is, after all, but one species of ostrich in 
Africa. 

The geographical range of the ostrich, so far as can 
be ascertained from the published accounts of travellers 
and naturalists, is very extensive, although at the pre- 
sent day, no doubt, it is much more restricted than was

formerly the case. At one time ita distribution north- 
ward seems to have extended from Senegambia on the 
west, through Southern Morocco, Algeria, and Egypt, 
into Arabia, Syria,' and even Mesopotamia on the east; 
for according to Xenophon (Anabasis, I. v. 2) it was 
formerly to be met with in the plains of Artemisia near 
Thapaacus, on the left bank of the Euphrates ; and it ia 
possible that within historic times it penetrated even 
farther to the eastward as far as Sindh, since modern 
palEeontologists affirm that fossil remains of the ostrich 
have undoubtedly been met with at the base of the 
Sivalik Hills iu North-West India, together with the 
mains of the camel and giraffi;.^ The whole subject 
of the distribution of the ostrich in Africa and Asia has 
been so fully and ably worked out by Drs. Finsch and 
Hartlaub in their excellent work " Die Vogel Ost 
Afrikas," ' that we cannot do better than give the sub- 
stance of their remarks in the following translation, 
adding by way of footnotes and fresh paragraphs such 
additional information as has come to hand since their 
remarks were published : — 

From Southern Algeiia to the interior of the Cape 
Colony the ostrich is found throughout Africa wherever

ITS GEOGRAPHICAL RANGE. 



tunting has not driven it away. That this is the case 
in many localities there is no doubt. Hartnaann states 
that where in 1823 Hemprieh and Ehrenberg hunted 
ostriches, namely, in the interior of the Bahiuda country, 
the species is now extinct, as it is on all the routes to 
Kartoom through the Bahiuda desert from Old Dongola, 
Buri, Dubbeh, and Ambukol : it is now hardly ever met 
with north of I7°N. lat.^ The same may be said of 
the plains of El Mograh between Cairo and Suez, where 
in 18 16 Burckhardt saw many wild ostriches. Von 
Heuglin looked in vain for them in the Lybian desert 
and in Central Egypt ; but Prince Halim Pasha, a trust- 
worthy hunter, assured him that within a few days' 
journey from Cairo he found freshly-disturbed ostrich 
nests and breeding-places. 

In these countries formerly, frequent mention was 
made of the bird. Pocock states^ that in 1743 he met 
■with it in the hilly desert lands to the south-west of 
Alexandria. Sonnini saw fresh tracks in the desert of 
Bahireh,' and Minutoli noticed ilocks of from ten 
to fifteen birds on the route from Alexandria to Siwah 
and Demah, where they were hunted with the ancient 
device of the screen (or stalking-horse), behind which the 
hunters concealed themselves.* 

Hartmann was informed by the mounted Bedouins 
f in the service of the Pasha, called Mogreb, that the 
\ ostrich was by no means rare in the bush-eovered 



' Dr. Leared, in Lis recent work " Morocco and the Moore," states (p. 308) 
that the ostrich is only met with in the south of that country, about 
Wadnoon and the borders of the Sahara. Birds of the largest eize and 
finest plumage are found in this district.

valleys of the Lybian desert, and that it is of still more 
frequent occurrence in the deserts of Kordofau on the 
White Nile, especially to the south of the Nuwerlande 
on the Blue Nile (where, avoiding the high forest growth 
along the river bauk, it keeps to the interior of the 
Khalah desert), as well as in the districts of the Bes- 
chari and Shukurieh, towards Gebel-Mauderah and 
Nakub - Kheli - Eerah,' In rainy years it has been 
known to appear in the desert of Southern Nubia. In 
Gedarich it has been met with ia open grassy desert 
land covered with acacias and other shrubs. From a 
verbal statement of Beurraann, it appears that ostriches 
were observed in the year iS6o between Berber and 
Suakin, and more recently in Baraka. Barth dur- 
ing his long travels found this bird nowhere more 
numerous and less shy than in the open bushy plains of 
Airs — for instance, in the plain of Tiu-teggana, where it 
abounds. In the moat southerly parts of the Sahara, 
Gerard Rohlfs observed ostriches on the road between 
Tripoli and Kuka in the undulating verdure-clad plains 
of Tintumma near Belkaschifari, and consequently be- 
yond the southern limits of the desert, and here they 
were found in large numbers. The Darfurer Gellabin 
tribe informed Hartmann that they obtain their ostrich 
feathera (an important article of trade with them) from 
the Bedouin tribes Hamr, M'Aalia, Ergat, Mahamid, 
Mahrieh, and Saidieh, and bring them to Sioot in Upper 
Egypt. On the Red Sea, according to Heuglin, the 
most northerly locality for the ostriches is the plains 
about Berenice Troglodytica (24° N. lat.). It is com- 
mon, he says, in the plains of Habab, and although not

met with in the Danakil country, it certainly occura in 
the saline plains that separate the latter from Abyssinia. 
It is common, too, he adds, in the Somali country.' In 
Abyssinia it was only met with in the lowlands, espe- 
cially in the Mareb.' Cai'Io Piaggia, who has paid some 
attention to the birds of the Niam-Niam country, does 
not mention this species. Captain Burton saw ostriches 
in the maritime valleys south of Saila, but they were 
very wild and shy, and kept out of rilie range. He was 
assured by the Eev. Mr. Erhardt of the Mombas Mis- 
sion that this was likewise the case farther south.* 
Von der Decken's expedition remarked the same thing. 
Rarely, they said, did an ostrich egg refresh them, and 
amongst the frontier tribe Masai they seldom saw any 
ostrich feathers worn as head ornaments. But they met 
with the bird not far from Kilibassi, on a high table- 
land covered with luxuriant grasses and thick forest 
growth in the interior of Marseh, throughout a district 
enlivened by antelopes and ostriches. Captains Burton 
and Speke encountered ostriches first on the journey 
to the Tanganyika on the plateau of Ugogo, from whence 
it wanders through Unyamesi and Usukuma to Ujiji.* 

" The polygamous bird," says Capt. Burton, " was 
first observed on the Ugbgo plateau ; it extends 
through Unyamesi and Usukuma to Ujiji. The eggs

are sold, Bometimes fresh, but more generally stale;- 
Emptied and dried, they form the principal circulat- 
ing medium between the Arab merchants and the 
coffee-growing races near the Nyanza Lake, who cut 
them up and grind them into ornamental diacs and cre- 
scents. The young birds are caught, but are rarely 
tamed. In Usukuma the bright and glossy feathers of 
the old male are much esteemed for adorning the 
hair ; yet, curious to say, the bird is seldom hunted. 
Moreover, these East Africans have never attempted 
to export the feathers, whieh, when white and uninjured, 
are sold even by the Somal for eight dollars per pound. 
The birds are at once wild and stupid, timid and head- 
strong : their lengthened strides and backward glances 
announce terror at the sight of man, and it is im- 
possible to staJk them in the open grounds whieh they 
prefer,"' 

Lieutenant Cameron, RN., writing to Mr. de Mosen- 
thal in May 1876, in reply to his inquiries concerning 
the ostrich in Central Africa, says ;^ 

" I saw ostriches at Unyanyembe {5° S.lat. 33" E. long.) 
on my journey across ; these had been brought from the 
countries N.E, of that place. During my naval service 
on the East Coast, from 1866 to 1870, I saw ostriches at 
Zanzibar, brought from the interior. They are said to 
be abundant in the Masai Country, N.W. of Mombasa, 
behind the Gallas, extending to the Victoria Nyanza. 
Ostrich eggs are brought to Benguela from the S.E. I 
do not believe that latitude has anything to do with the 
habitat of the ostrich. It depends upon the nature of 
the country. Why ostriches are only found on great

plains is, I believe, because they are utterly unfitted 
for woody and hilly districts. From their great speed, 
they can live, like antelopes and zebraa, in a country 
with very little water. The reason for their not being 
found in the districts you mention is, that they are 
wooded and hUly." 

Zanzibar and Mozambique, with the wooded and 
marshy plains of the Zambesi country, seem quite desti- 
tute of ostriches, and, according to Professor Barboza 
du Bocage, the same may be said of the Portuguese 
colonies on the west coast of Africa, Congo, Angola, and 
Benguela. Even in countries still farther south the 
bird is unknown. Mohr, who travelled through Zulu- 
land, a hilly and grassy country, looked in vain for 
ostriches, although, according to Jeppe,^ the bird is 
found in flocks of from ten to thirty individuals in the 
neighbouring Transvaal Republic.'' 

In regard to the existence of the ostrich in Asia, 
it seems desirable to give some details here, for in 
Brehm's well-known work, " Illustrirtes Thierleben," 
which contains one of the best compilations on this

country, he got a long shot at one, but " he was going like the wind." Some 

le afterwards, near Nanta, he hod another shot, witich proved, however, 
to be equally unsuccessful. The Maccalacas KafGts, lie states, use

ject. 

Nevertheless, the ostrich fonnerly inhabited Central 
Asia and India, while in Sjria, Arabia, and Mesopota- 
mia it has been known from time immemorial. Yet, 
strange to say, Herodotus, Strabo, Aristotle, and Pliny 
all mention the ostrich only as an African bird. Dio- 
dorus, however, clearly refers to it amongst the animals 
of that part of Arabia which adjoins Syria. The pas- 
sage is quoted by Bochart. Mr. A. H. Layard, in his 
account of Nineveh, informs us that ostrich feathers 
appear as ornaments ou the robes of the figures in the 
oldest sculptures of Nimrod, together with the emble- 
matic flower, and frequently figures on the Babylonian 
and Assyrian cylinders, from which we may conclude 
that the ostrich was a sacred bird. That it was known 
in ancient times to the Jews ia clear from its being so 
often mentioned in the Old Testament. 

u: * * * * * 

Xenophon observed the ostrich in the plaius of Arte- 
misia on the left bank of the Euphrates, in the neigh- 
bourhood of Thapsacus (Anabasis, I, v. 2). Amongst 
EugUsh authors, Canon Tristram, referring to the alleged 
former existence of the ostrich in Sindh, states that a 
friend of his, Mr, Surtees, who resided there for some 
time, heard many traditions to this effect.' 

It is worthy of note, that in the history of the cele- 
brated march of Alexander the Great through Asia, no 
mention is made of the ostrich in India. Contrary to 
expectation, also, Sanskrit literatm-e is silent on this

subject, for neither Lassen nor Kosnias make any allu- 
sion to this bird.

Herr Schlagintweit, in reply to Dr. Hartlaub'a inquiries, 
Btated that during his travels in India he never obtained 
any proof of the existence of the ostrich there at any 
time, although in the valley of the Ganges ostrich eggs 
were sometimes offered as articles of commerce to the 
pilgrims proceeding to Mecca. But these eggs were 
doubtless of Arabian and not Indian origin. The late 
Mr. Blytb, during a long residence in India, was unable 
to procure any evidence of the former existence of the 
ostrich either in Sindh or Beluchistan. He says, how- 
ever, that ostrich eggs imported from Africa or Arabia 
are frequently met with in India, and are hung up in 
the mosques. Those which one sees in all the Turkish 
mosques banging from the ceiling, are, without excep- 
tion, presents from Mecca pilgrims. The same custom, 
says Buckingham, prevails at the Great Mosque of Orfa 
in Central Mesopotamia.^ The ostrich is mentioned by 
Marco Polo only in his "Inde Moyenue," by which, as 
is well known, he means Abyssinia. 

The vague statement of (Elian (siv. 13), to the effect 
that the King of India supped on the eggs of ostriches, 
swans, and geese, may be referred to as the only historical 
notice of the ostrich in India, and therefore not unim- 
portant. 

Ritter has some remarkable notes which demonstrate 
the probability, if not the certainty, that at one time 
the ostrich must have lived in Central Asia.' In the

Chinese work Sse-ma-Tsien, edited by Brosset, we read 
(vol. ii. p. 433), that in the year 107 B.C. the Chinese sent 
an embassy to Ansi (Bokhara), and on its return several 
of the people of Anai, who joined the embassy, brought 
eggs from their large birds (ostriches) as presents, which 
were much admired by the Chinese, who compared them 
to their china vases. Much later, namely, in the year 
650 A.D., it appears from Remusat's edition of the 
Chinese author Matuanlin, that the King of Samarkand 
(Kbangkin) paid a tribute to China in ostrich eggs. 
About the same time, also, says Eemusat,' the ambas- 
sadors of Youechi (Yueti), the modern Thokaristan or 
Turkestan, brought a live camel-bird or ostrich as a 
present to China.^ Again, referring to the plateau of 
Iran, Bitter's notice seems important. He says, accord- 
ing to Cedrenus, about the year 627 a.d., at one of the 
courts of the Sassanides Pallastes Beklal, between the 
river Digaldah and the little Zab river (ruins of Dasta- 
gerd), oatriches used to be kt^pt in confinement.* Pro- 
fessor Hermann Vambery informed Drs. Finsch and Hart- 
laub that although he had not himself seen the ostrich 
during his travels in Asia, it was not unknown, even at 
the present day, in Southern Persia about Kerman. 
In Central Asia he had only heard of the bird on the 
Lower Oxus, especially in the neighbourhood of Kun- 
grat, where it appears as a straggler from the southern 
deserts. 

Turkoman hunters know the ostrich as the Tiije ktishu 
or camel-bird. In Central Asia it ia sometimes called

Colonel Capper/ whUe on the road from Aleppo to 
Bussorah, saw troops of antelopes and ostriches, but at 
a great distance. Olivier,^ describing his tour through 
the Arabian Euphrates desert to Taigibeh, saya that he 
observed ostriches in greater numbers than usual, but a 
long way off. Towards Bagdad, where tlie extensive 
plains were formerly covered with saline plants, mimosas, 
and fragrant absinthia, he remai-ked that the wild ass 
and the ostrich were no longer found, as in Xenophon's 
time ; their appearance on the Nisibis road, too, being 
quite a rare occui'renee. 

In the Euphrates desert, says Wellsted,' from Hit to 
Damascus, ostriches might be seen in flocks, but were 
not easily approached ; and Petermann also states* that 
ostriches occur in this desert, whence the Arabs bring 
eggs, feathers, and even whole skins, to Sug and Schiuch 
on the Lower Euphrates, not far from Bussorah. Ains- 
worth, in his work on Assyria, merely observes that the 
ostrich continues to get rarer in Western Asia. 

Mr. A. H, Layard, picturing a spring in iVIesopotamia, 
describes horsemen near the village of Nimrud with 
bunches of ostrich feathers tied on their long spears. 
Captain Burton, too, similarly describes the lances of 
the Hejaz Bedouins in Arabia.' 

In regard to Syria, Burckhardt speaks of ostriches in

the great Syrian desert, especially in the plains extend- 
ing from Hauran to Gebel-Shammar and Neyd.' Soli- 
tary birds were met with in Hauran, and every year some 
are killed witliiu a short journey of Damascus. Accord- 
ing to Canon Tristram, the ostrich, even at the present 
day, is occasionally to be found wandering from Arabia 
towards the Belka, to the south-east of Palestine. He 
himself obtained a specimen there, shot by the Sheik 
Aghyle Agha. 

The Prussian Consul at Damascus, Herr Wetzstein, 
well known for his Oriental researches, informed Drs. 
Finsch and Hartlaub, through their friend Dr. Bastian, 
of Berlin, that the ostrich is chiefly confined to two dis- 
tricts, namely, the Bassida, between the Belka and the 
Seliemmar Mountains, and the Dekhena, a stony desert 
in the direction of these same mountains. Skins of the 
bird are brought to Damascus by the Montefiek, a nomad 
tribe of the Ruwala, generally in the month of May. 
Herr Wetzstein sometimes saw as many as fifty ostrich 
skins in their tents, and the number annually exported 
to Marseilles may amount perhaps to five hundred. In 
consequence of this general exportation, there are none 
left in the bazaars at Damascus. 

Amongst the notes with which Herr Wetzstein sup- 
plied Dr. Delitsch for his " Commentary on the Book of 
Job," the following occurs at p. 476 :—" Ostriches are 
frequently found in the vast sandy plains of Ard-ed- 
Dehana, between the Schemmar Mountains and the 
SawSd, From thence the hunters return to Syria at the 
end of April with their spoils, consisting of ostrich skins 
with all the feathers on. Such a skin is called Gizze."

ITS GEOGRAPHICAL RANGE. 31 

The doubt expressed by Dr. von Heuglia as to the 
existence of the ostrich at tlie present day in Arabia is 
evidently unfounded. Capt. Burton states positively that 
the bird is not rare in El Hejaz, that the young are 
cangbt and tamed, and tliat the eggs are sold in the 
bazaars of Medina.' Still more important is the evi- 
dence of Palgrave, who saw ostriches in North-West 
Arabia, on the way from M4an to Djouf. " Here," he 
aays,* "we sighted a large troop of ostriches; no bird 
on earth is more timid, or more difficult of approach. 
When we saw them far ahead, running in a long line 
one after the other, we almost took them for a string of 
scared camels. The Sherarah hunt them, as their plu- 
mage i.s largely bought up on the frontier, to be re-sold 
in Egypt or Syria. But their greatest enemies are the 
Solibab-Bedouins." These are most likely the hunting 
tribe of the Salabah, mentioned by Herr Wetzstein, 

So much, then, for the distribution of the oatricli in 
Asia in ancient aud modern times. It is as certain 
that it still exists there as that it is becoming rarer 
and rarer every year. It only remains to add, that in 
the rich fossil strata of the Sivalik Hills of North- 
Western India, fossil remains of this bird have been 
found, intermingled with those of the camel, giraffe, and 
other animals. 

Attention has already been directed (p. 3) to the 
characters which distinguish the ostrich from all other 
birds, but a few additional details of interest may here 
be noted. 

The ancients called this species the "camel-bird," a 
name which to this day has an equivalent amongst the

Arats and native tribes of many parts of Africa. Tlie 
resemblance, indeed, which it beara in many peculiari- 
ties of structure to the ruminating aoimals, no doubt 
led Aristotle to assert that it was partly bird and partly 
quadruped, a notion which was ako shared by Pliny.

thighs, denuded of feathers ; the cloven feet, with their 
padded soles, well adapted for crossing large tracts of 
yielding sand, are obviously points in which it strangely 
resembles the camel. Other analogous peculiarities, 
although not externally apparent, are equally note- 
worthy. In the camel there is a large callous pad on 



" CAMEL-BIRD" OF THE ANCIENTS. 33 

the chest, upon which, when reposing, the animal throws 
a great portion of its weight. In the ostrich, the ster- 
num or breastbone, which, as already stated, has no 
keel, is merely a convex bony shield, but is covered with 
a callous pad or cushion, having a hard, rough surface, 
denuded of feathers, on which the bird leans when at 
rest.* The large sac-like form of the proventriculns, 
with its system of glands for secreting a solvent fluid 
wherewith to reduce its food, is noteworthy. Nor ought 
we to overlook the developed condition of the diaphragm, 
which muscular expansion in the apteryx is complete. 
Like the camel, this remarkable bird is admirably 
adapted in its structure for traversing the- desert and 
dwelling beneath a burning sun. 

" When seen at a distance moving over the desert," 
says a modem traveller in Egypt," " the camels struck 
me as resembling in a most remarkable degree their 
desert companion the ostrich. It may seem strange to 
say that a bird and a quadruped have the same profile, 
yet such is undoubtedly the fact with tliese two denizens 
of the same sandy wilds : both hold their heads very 
forward, with necks much elevated and stretched out ; 
then the long legs of the camel are all near together, 
■whereas those of the ostrich are wide apart, and the 
result is that, seen at a distance, these two very different 
creatures might be easily mistaken for each other. Nor 
is this a fancy peculiar to myself alone, for since writing 
the above impression, as it struck me in Egypt, I have

in a line struck that experienced traveller aa having 
a strange resemblance to a string of camels on the 
march. "^ 

The fleetness of the ostrich is proverbial; and although 
it would be out of place here to enter upon anything 
like a detailed account of the bird's anatomy, a brief 
allusion may be made to the muscular mechanism of the 
leg of the ostrich, which may be regarded aa one of the 
moat interesting pieces of mechanism to be met with in 
the animal kingdom.' 

Dr. Haughton in an elaborate paper on the subject' 
says : — " The leg of the ostrich is to be regarded as 
a long rod bent at four distinct points, which attains 
its greatest amount of shortening or bending at the 
moment the foot touches the ground, and which ia 
suddenly straightened or elongated by the simultaneous 
contraction of all the muscles. The effect of the sudden 
elongation of the leg is to throw the whole body of the 
bird forward, aa if from a catapult, from the point of sup- 
port of the foot ; and while the body of the animal is thus 
projected through the ail', the antagonist muscles that flex 
the several joints come into play, and are assisted in their 
action by some very remarkable contrivances in the heel- 
joint." These Dr. Haughton describes and figures. 



' Palgrave's remark is, "When we saw them far ahead, running in a 
long line one after the other, we almost took them for a Btring of scared 
camelfl." — Op. cit., vol. i. p. 43.

MECHANISM OF THE LEG. 35 

"It ia neeesaary," he says, "to the perfection of the 
meehaniam, that the greatest possible amount of mua- 
cular force ahall i)e expended in straightening or un- 
bending the legs alternately projecting the animal from 
foot to foot along the ground, the leg being at its 
maximum of flexure at the moment of touching the

ground, and at its maximum of elongation at the 
moment of leaving it ; and also, that the minimum 
possible amount of force shall be expended in flexing 
each leg preparatory to its next spring, which must 
take place on touching the ground." 
Br. Haughton shows that the leg of the ostrich fulfils 



3,6 THE OSTRICH. 

these two conditiona of perfect mechanism, and describes 
in detail the muscles employed in the act of running. 

Describing the action of the muscles, he says {torn, 
cit. p. 57): "In the act of running, the leg of the 
ostrich is to be regarded as a jointed lever having four 
joints, viz., the hip, the knee, the heel, and the metatarsal 
joints. As the animal springs from foot to foot, the 
whole limb on reaching the ground is bent as far as 
possible at each of the articulations, and when the 
spring is made, the muscles proper to each joint in- 
crease the angle made by the bones meeting at the 
joint, BO that the effect of the whole is to unbend the 
limb, and give it a maximum of extension at the 
moment of leaving- the ground. During the spring, 
the antagonist muscles again bend the joints, so that 
on nest touching the ground it is at its maximum of 
flexion, again waiting to be unbent by the muscles 
that open the angles of the joint ; and so on for ever, as 
the animal runs, it is thrown alternately from each foot 
in contact with the ground, aa from a catapult, and ad- 
vances by successive leaps or springs from foot to foot." 

The length of its stride when bounding at full speed, 
as measured by Canon Tristram in the Sahara, varies 
from twenty-two to twenty-eight feet, and its rate of 
speed has been estimated by Dr. Livingstone at twenty- 
six miles an hour. He says : ' — " The ostrich when 
feeding has a pace of from twenty to twenty-two inches ; 
when walking at other times, about four inches more. 
In general, the eye cannot follow its legs. I was 
once able to count the steps by a stop-watch, and if 
I am not mistaken, the bird made thirty strides 

1 " Miaaionary Travels in South Africa," p. 154. 



ITS SPEED ESTIMATED. 



in ten seconds. Eeckoning each stride at twelve feet, 
we have a speed of about twenty-sLx miles per hour." 

The ostrich is gregarious, although the flocks are not 
generally very large. Canon Tristram states ^ that the 
North African bird is less gregarious than that of the 
Cape, probably from the comparative scarcity of food ; 
and that it generally lives in companies of from four to 
six individuals, which do not appear to be in the habit, 
under ordinary circumstances, of wandering more than 
twenty or thirty miles from their headquarters. 

Shy and wild, the ostrich is able to travel an enormous 
distance when so inclined. During the day it knows no 
rest. Its whole nature seems indicative of haste and 
hurry, and it may frequently be met with far from any 
water, even in the hottest season, and in places where 
no green shrub or leaf is to be aeen.^ 

Dr. Goase states that in Senegal during the hot season 
the ostrich often bathes, but does not swim. ^ Heuglin 
has remarked that on the coast of Abyssinia these birds 
frequently bathe in the sea, and on hot days may be 
Been standing for hours up to their necks in the water. 
The cry of the ostrich is deep, hoarse, and lugubrious, 
and in the stillness of the desert may be heard at a con- 
siderable distance. In the Scriptures this cry is termed 
a " wailing,"- — •wihelMmothjaanali, or, as in the Vulgate, 
luctum quasi struthionum. Canon Tristram has likened 
it to the hoarse lowing of an ox in pain.* By others it 
has been likened to the roar of a lion.^

The young are said to utter no cry. Dr. Sparrman, 
who took one with him from Honey Klip to the Cape, 
during twenty-four days never heard it emit any sound, 
even when by accident on cue occasion his horse trod 
upon it. 

In regard to food, the ostrich may be said to be 
omnivorous. Seeds, berries,' fruit, grass, leaves, beetles, 
locusts, small birds and animals, snakes and lizards, are 
all greedily devoured ; while the trituration of the food 
is aided by quantities of sand, stones, grit, bones, and 
even pieces of metal, which are swallowed indiscrimi- 
nately as opportunity occurs. So indifferent, indeed, does 
the bird seem to what is palatable or nourishing, that it 
is said to feed upon whatever it can swallow." This in- 
difference not unfrequently causes its death, since it 
takes into the system substances which are not only 
indigestible, but sometimes even poisonous. The 
stomach of an ostrich which died in the Zoological 
Society's Gardens, Regent Park, was found to contain, 
amongst other things, a number of copper coins to the 
value of 9^d. Many of these were much worn and 
defaced, but there is no doubt that they operated to 
cause the bird's death.^ 

The reproduction of the ostrich is a subject of some 
interest, and is one, moreover, on which some miscon- 
ception seems still to exist, inasmuch oa one continually 
meets with the oft-repeated statement that the eggs are 
laid in the bare sand, and are left by the bird to be 
hatched entirely by the heat of the sun.

those of the askanit Genchras echinalvj, and amongst berrica tliusc of tbe

HAUNTS AND HABITS. 39 

This is not quite correct, or, if it be the case in the 
warmest regionSj it is otherwise in cooler latitudes. In- 
deed, by a remarkable instinct, the ostrich site upon its 
eggs by night, when the cold would be too great for them, 
and leaves them to the sun's beat only during the day. 

The following account of the discovery of an ostrich's 
nest in the Soudan by Mr. A. B. Meyers conveys a good 
idea of the bird's home and surroundings, and contains, 
moreover, some interesting partiexUars upon a subject to 
which African travellers, as a rule, have paid but little 
attention, In company with some brother officers, Mr. 
Meyers made a sporting tour in the Soudan during the 
winter of 1S74-75, and the following extract is taken 
from their recently published journal.' 

Under date 18th March the writer says: "At an 
BM-ly hour one of our old friends, the ostrich-hunters, 
came to tell us that he knew where there was an ostrich 
nest, and that if we would give him good backsheesh he 
would take us to it. After a certain amount of squab- 
bling, we came to reasonable terms, dependent on success 
or otherwise, and started off without delay on this novel 
expedition; and owing to the distance, and the con- 
sequent possibility of our being away all night, we pro- 
vided ourselves with a limited supply of food and w-ater, 
and with the friend of our dinner-table' — ^the little 
whisky-barrel. A long ride over the high tableland in 
the direction of the Eoyan brought us evidently near our 
destination ; but here arose a difficulty, for owing to the 
similarity of the ground, consisting of thinly-scattered 
mimosas and high grass, with here and there small 
spaces where it had been burned up, our guide

wandered about for a long time before he could find 
the trees that were his landmark. When he succeeded 
in doing so, we tied up our horses, and tried to creep 
quietly along in line ; but with the crackling of the grass 
at each step, this was impossible, and we had the dis- 
appointment of seeing a black ostrich rise from the nest 
and instantly disappear when we were a long way from 
it. We then went up to the neat, and found that it 
contained sixteen eggs, the proper complement being 
twenty-five, according to the Arab. The nest, if such 
it eonld be called, consisted merely of a very shallow 
depression in the hard-baked soil, in the centre of a small 
burnt-up patch of ground, surrounded by high grass, 
and though the eggs were closely packed together, they 
covered a considerable space. Vivian and myself were 
then carefully concealed in the grass on opposite sides 
of the nest to watch, and I was so thatched over that I 
could see literally nothing but the nest. After an hour 
of this very monotonous amusement, two visitors in the 
form of vultures pounced down upon the nest, and, 
apparently quite satisfied with the certainty of a quiet 
feast, commeaeed operations by a personal hunt amongst 
their own feathers ; then a general survey was made of 
the white objects before them ; and finally, having re- 
tired for a moment, each returned with a stone in its 
beak, and set to work to hammer a hole through the 
shell of an egg. But the talents of these experienced old 
thieves were not allowed to obtain their just reward on 
this occasion, for whUst thus occupied an ostrich was 
seen by Vivian approaching the nest, and he fired at 
it, but, wounded or otherwise, it made good its escape 
without being even seen by me, and the vultures also of 
course disappeared at the same moment. It was a pity

ttat the arrival of the ostrich should have so abruptly 
terminated this interesting stance. It was then useless 
watcliing any longer, and after our men's aiTival and the 
robbery of two eggs; we retired to a little distance to 
enjoy a frugal repast of baked ostrich eggs, biscuits, and 
sardines," 

The male ostriches, which are polygamous, fight vigor- 
ously in the breeding season for the possession of the 
females. Each cock-bird associates with three or four 
hens, aU of which lay their eggs in one large nest 
scooped out in the sand, and relieve each other by turns 
at incubation, Le Vaillant purposely watched an 
ostrich's nest, and during the day saw four hens sit 
successively on the same eggs, a male bird coming late 
in the evening to take his turn at incubation. Each 
hen lays from a dozen to twenty eggs, but seldom sits 
upon more than sixteen. Incubation lasts six weeks, 
the cock-bird taking his turn at sitting like the hens. 
As the time draws nigh for the young to make their 
appearance, the male often becomes impatient, and has 
actually been observed to lean with his chest upon an 
egg, crack it, then take it up in his beak by the mem- 
brane inside the egg, and shake it violently until 
the young bird dropped out, when he would swallow 
the membrane and repeat the operation upon another.' 
•The young run as soon as hatched, and are speedily able 
to shift for themselves. The parent ostrich behaves to 
its brood in much the same manner as does a domes- 
tic fowl with chickens, scraping the sand aroimd, and 
searching for and breaking up their food for them. 

Although each hen lays a large number of eggs in the 




43 - THE OSTRICH. 

nest, many more are dropped in the neighbourhood, and 
it is asserted that theae latter are broken by the parents 
as Boon as the young arc hatched, and serve for their 
first meals.' 

The remarkable difference which is observable in the 
texture of the shell in eggs from North and South Africa 
has already been noted.^ 

In taking the eggs from the nest, the natives, who 
esteem them a delicacy (if not indeed a necessary where 
other food is scarce), are careful not to touch any with 
the hand, but nse a long stick to draw them out, so 
that the bird may not detect the smell of the intruder, 
and in consequence forsake the nest. Where this is 
skilfully managed, they return and lay again. Each 
egg weighs about three pounds, and is thus equal in bulk 
to about two dozen common hen's eggs/ 

European travellers assert that an omelette raade with 
an ostrich egg is exceedingly good eating. The natives 
generally cook an egg by setting it upright on a fire, and 
stirring it about with a forked stick which they insert 
through a hole in the end which is uppermost. 

The shell, being thick and strong, is applied to various 
uses, but is chiefly turned to account as a vessel for 
watex. Bush girls and Bakahari women who belong to 
the wandering Bechuana tribes of the Kalahari district, 
may be seen coming down to the fountains from their- 
dwellings, each carrying on her back a kaross, or net, 
containing from twelve to fifteen eggshells, which have

Leen emptied by a small aperture at one end ; these they 
fill with water, tightly closing up the hole with grass. A 
group of women thus employed will be found depicted 
in Livingstone's " Missionary Travels in South Africa." 

In the case of a bird whose plumes form so valuable an 
article of commerce, it is not to be wondered at that many 
and various methods should be devised for its capture. 

In Ara.bia, as a rule, the bird is killed while sitting 
on its eggs. The hen, which in the breeding season is 
very reluctant to quit the neat, crouches down, and 
lowering its head and neck to the ground, fixes its eye 
motionless upon the approaching enemy. In this posi- 
tion, say the Bedouins, one must have a heart of stone to 
fire at the poor bird. But the love of gain prevails, and 
it is ruthlessly destroyed. As soon as it is killed, the 
hunter buries the blood, and laying the dead lien again 
on the eggs, digs a hole iu the sand at a little distance, 
where he conceals himself until sunset, when the male 
returns, only to share the same fate.^ 

Between Alexandria and Dernah, Minutoli found that 
the ostrich-hunters resort to the old device of the screen 
or stalking-horse, behind which they conceal themselves, 
and so cautiously steal upon the bird unawares. Accord- 
ing to the geographer Strabo, the black tribe called by 
him Struthophages, from their practice of eating ostrich- 
meat, used to cover themselves with an ostrich skin, and 
thrusting the right arm into the skin of the neck, which 
they held aloft, by this device easily approached their 
game, and killed it. 

This imitation bird is a perfect mimic of the real one, 
and at the distance of a hundred yards it is almost

44- THE OSTRICH. 

impossible to detect the difference. Now it turns its 
head aa if keeping a sharp look out ; now it picks at 
the verdure on the ground, or at any water-melon or 
shrub which may be in its path ; now it shakes its 
feathers, sometimes trotting and sometimes walking, 
until at length the wary bushman gets within bow-shot 
of some unlucky bu'd, and when, having discharged his 
arrow, one of the flocks run off in any direction, the 
sham bird runs off too. The rest of the flock are quite 
unable to understand why their comrade should suddenly 
run away and then lie down, and they allow the enemy 
to follow them up until they share the same fate. 
Several are often secured in this way before they get 
scent of the impostor. 

The great difficulty on these occasions is to get to 
leeward of the flock, for if once a bird winds him, away 
they all go, and the trouble is taken for nothing. 

In Morocco, according to Dr. Leared in his recently 
published work on that country,^ " the ostrich is hunted 
by Arabs mounted on the desert horses already described. 
The party advance cautiously against the wind, and 
with long intervals between each horseman, until marks 
of the birds' feet are discovered. These are followed up 
until the birds themselves are discovered by the hunters. 
A dash at full speed is then made after the game, until 
the ostriches turn and face their pursuers. They do 
this because their pace, which is accomplished by a com- 
bination of flying and running, is interfered with by the 
action of the wind upon their wings. The gauntlet has 
then to be run among the armed sportsmen, who either 
shoot or maim the birds by throwing at their legs a

short ttick stick formed of hard-grained and heavy 
wood. In the use of this implement the Arabs are 
extremely dexterous. "When secured, the throats of the 
birds are cut and the feathers plucked off These, and 
the flesh, which, although coarse, is eaten, are then 
divided among the hunters." 

The mode of hunting the ostrich in other parts of 
North Africa has been well described by Hartmann in 
Cabanis' Journal, and, so far as the Sahara is con- 
cerned, by Canon Tristram in his work on the Great 
Sahara. Hartmann's statement that certain of the 
Bedouins hunt the ostrich on dromedaries is confirmed 
by the observations of Captain Burton, who says, that 
in Somali-land the natives hunt the bird on camels 
and shoot it with poisoned arrows.' In the Sahara it is 
ridden down on horseback, and its capture in this way, 
says Canon Tristram, is the greatest feat of hunting to 
which the Saharan sportsman aspires. " In richness of 
booty," he observes,^ " it ranks next to the plunder of a 
caravan. But such prizes are not to be obtained without 
cost and toil, and it is generally estimated that the 
capture of an ostrich must be at the sacrifice of the life 
of a horse or two. So wary is the bird, and so vast 
are the plains over which it roams, that no ambuscades 
or artifices can be employed, and the vulgar resource of 
dogged perseverance is the only mode of pursuit. The 
horses undergo a long and painful training ; abstinence 
from water as much as possible and a diet of dry dates 
being considered the best means for strengthening their 
wind. The hunters of the tribes to the east of M'zab

set forth with small skins of water strapped under their 
horses' bellies, and a scanty allowance of food for four or 
five days distributed judiciously about their saddles. As 
soon aa the birds are descried, two or three of the 
hunters follow the herd at a gentle gallop, endeavouring 
only to keep the birds in sight, without alarming them 
or driving them at full speed, when they would soon be 
lost to view. The rest of the pursuers leisurely proceed 
in a direction at right angles to the course the ostriches 
have taken, knowing by experience their habit of running 
in a circle. Posted on the best look-out they can find, 
they await for hours the anticipated route of the game, 
calculating upon intersecting their path. If fortunate 
enough to detect them, the relay sets upon the now 
fatigued flock, and frequently succeeds in running down 
one or more, though some of their horses usually fall ex- 
hausted in the pursuit. The bird when overtaken offers. 
no resistance beyond kicking out sideways. A skin 
in full plumage is worth on the spot from forty to a 
hundred Spanish dollars ; but the Arabs are in the habit 
of judiciously thinning the feathers, so that the trader 
can rarely obtain a specimen on which this tax has not 
been previously paid." 

The Bushmen, like the Somali-men, kill the ostrich 
with poisoned arrows, or catch it very cleverly in pit- 
falls, or with the lasso ;' and the Sukurieh and Haden- 
dawah tribes likewise use the lasao, with which the 
bird, when once fairly caught, is strangled.^ A favouiite 
plan is to wait for the bird in a place of coucealm(3nt as 
near as possible to the pools to which they come for 
water, and then with a gun loaded with swan-shot to

fire at their necks aa they stoop to drink, when perhaps 
half-a-dozen are laid low at once. 

Another plan to which the Bushman often reaorta ia 
simpler still. Having found an ostrich's nest, he removes 
all the egga, and ensconcing himself in the nest, quietly 
awaits the return of the bird, which he shoots with a 
poisoned arrow before it has time to recover from its sur- 
prise at finding him there instead of its eggs. In Senaar 
the Ab6-K6f bring it down by throwing a curved and 
flat stick from two and a half to three feet long, not 
unlike the Australian boomerang, and made of tough 
acacia wood or hard zizyphus. Heughn states that the 
Eisahirt people (Eisahirten) keep tame ostriches on 
purpose to hunt the wild ones (just as tame elephants 
are employed to hunt wild ones), and that they profess 
to charm the wild ostrich with the soft notes of a reed- ' 
pipe. The late C. J. Anderason, in his book on Lake 
Ngami, has given a spirited description of the mode in 
which he and Mr. Gallon captured some young ostriches, 
which we will give in his own words : — 

" Ostriches are at all times more or less numerous on 
the Naarip Plain, but more pai'ticularly so at this season, 
on account of the Naras .... being now ripe ^ . . . ; 
and in a part of the plain entirely destitute of vegeta- 
tion we discovered a male and female ostrich with a 
brood of young ones about the size of ordinary barn- 
door fowls. This was a sight we had been long looking 
for, aa Gallon had been requested by Professor Owen to 
procure a few crania of the young of this bird in order 
to settle certain anatomical questions; accordingly we

fortliwitli dismounted from our oxen and gave chase, 
which proved of no ordinary interest, 

"The moment the parent birds became aware of our 
intention, they set off at full speed, the female leading 
the way, the young following in her wake, and the 
eoek, though at some little distance, bringing up the rear 
of the family party. It was very touching to observe 
the anxiety the old birds evinced for the safety of their 
progeny. Finding that we were quickly gaining upon 
them, the male at once slackened his pace and diverged 
somewhat from his course ; but seeing that we were not 
to be diverted from our purpose, he again increased bis 
speed, and with wings drooping so as almost to touch 
the ground, he hovered round us, now in wide circles, 
and then decreasing the circumference till he came 
almost within pistol-shot, when he abruptly threw him- 
self on the ground and struggled desperately to regain 
his legs, like a bird that has been badly wounded. 
Having previously fired at him, I really thought he was 
disabled, and made quickly towards him ; but this was 
only a ruse on his part, for on my nearer approach he 
slowly rose and began to run in an opposite direction to 
that of the female, who, by this time, was considerably 
ahead with her charge. 

"After about an hour's severe chase, we secured nine 
of the brood, and though it consisted of about double 
that number, we found it necessary to be content with 
what we had bagged, 

"On returning to the bay, however, the nest morn- 
ing in a mule-cart, Mr. Galton again encountered 
the same birds with the remainder of the family, 
and, after a short race, captured sis more of the 
chicks." 



METHODS OF CAPTURE. 



In Namaqua-land, says Andersson,^ tho following plan 
18 adopted with considerable success : — 

"A troop of ostriches being espied, a number of men 
unite and suiTound them ; but tbe interval between the 
hunters is great, the cordon being drawn at such a dis- 
tance beyond the birds (in fact, out of their sight) as not 
to arouse their suspicions. When a sufficient time lias 
been allowed to enable the hunters to complete the circle, 
a general advance is commenced, the men taking care 
not to appear to direct their attention to the birds, but 
merely showing themselves in such a manner as to force 
them to give way. As a matter of course, the ostriches 
make off from the supposed danger, but only to en- 
counter a fresh one, and thus rapidly become exhausted 
by a constant flight from one human being to another, 
■whilst the hunters, as soon as they perceive that the 
chances of escape for the ostriches are at an end, take 
care to keep them moving at a rapid pace by shouting, 
yelling, and gesticulating violently. A very sliort time 
usually suffices to bring the exciting scene to a close by 
a general slaughter of the entrap]}ed birds ; and with 
experienced huuters this plan rarely fails to ensure 
Buccess. The same people employ another method with 
even greater success : a whole tribe will join, mounted 
if possible on horseback ; and the locality to be ' drawn ' 
having been decided on, the body of horsemen station 
themselves across some pass, defile, or narrow part of a 
plain, whilst a few are despatched in search of the 
ostriches, and on their way station a comrade here and 
there at convenient intervals, and, having found their 
destined victims, the favourite haunts of which are well

known to them, gradually and cautiously begin to drive the 
unsuspecting birds towards their passive confederates. As 
soon as they have fairly succeeded in directing the course 
of the ostriches towards the desired quarter, they urge 
them on at a steady, telling pace ; and as the birds pass the 
mounted men who had been left behind at intervals, each 
of these successively takes up the pursuit, enabling the 
previous pursuer to drop behind and to allow his horse 
to recover its wind, whilst the ostriches, on the contrary, 
are never for a moment allowed to slacken their pace in 
their now headlong flight. The relieved hunters follow 
leisurely in an extended line or semicircle as the occa- 
sion may require, thus forming an effectual barrier to 
the retreat of tlie birds should they attempt such a 
course ; whilst the ostriches, by the time they reach the 
main body of horsemen, or even sooner, become so 
exhausted as to come to a dead halt or to fall helplessly 
to the ground, when the hunters slaughter them at 
leisure. It has thus happened that so great a number 
of ostriches have been entrapped and completely tired 
out, that, after as many had been killed as were required 
for food, the remainder, after being despoiled of their 
valuable wing and tail feathers, were suffered to depart 
without further injury." 

When an ostrich is killed, every part of the bird is 
utilised. The first step is to remove the skin, so as to 
preserve the feathers uninjured ; the next is to melt the 
fat, which is poured into bags made of the skin of the 
thighs tied at the lower end. The grease of a bird in 
good condition will fill the skin of both legs, which hold 
about four gallons. Not only is it eaten with bread, and 
used in the preparation of " kooskoosoo " and other food, 
but the Arabs regard it as a useful application in certain 




OSTRICH-MEAT. 51 

maladies. In all cases of rheumatism aud acute pains it 
is used by being well rubbed in, aud the parts affected 
are then covered with heated sand. 

Those who have tasted ostrich-meat state that it is 
both wholesome and palatable, although, as might be 
expected in the case of wild birds, it may be somewhat 
hard and tough. Where the birds have been domesti- 
cated, however, and fed on lucerne, clover, aud grain, the 
meat becomes juicy and tender. 

Notwithstanding its prohibition by the Jewish legis- 
lature, it would seem that ostrich-meat was not unfre- 
quently consumed in former times. Firmus, one of the 
kings of Egypt, it is said, used to dine off ostrich ; and 
according to Lampridius, the Emperor Heliogabalus, on 
the occasion of a great feast, caused the brains of six 
hundred ostriches to be served up in one diah. It is 
related of Leo Africanua that he partook of ostrich-meat 
in Numidia, where, it is said, young ostriches were then 
fattened expressly for the table. But whatever may 
have been the case formerly, this statement does not 
appear to have been confirmed by any recent traveller. 
Strabo, as already mentioned, gives a curious account 
of the Struthophages, a black tribe on the Upper Nile, 
who hunted and lived upon ostriches, and clothed them- 
selves with the skins of this bird. 

A recent observer, Canon Tristram, has remarked that 
the Arabs of the present day eat ostrich-meat, and that 
he himself has tasted it, and found it palatable enough. 
This opinion, too, is shared by Hartmann.i 

Mr. John Parkcs, of Wheatlands, Cape Colony, reports 
that last year {1875) he had a troop of seventy ostriches

feeding in the veldt. On one occasion an antelope sud- 
denly jumped up in their midst, and they took fright. 
Whilst running at full speed, one of the birds put bis 
foot in a hole and broke his leg. The poor bird lay 
there all night, and next morning Mr. Parkes brought 
him to the homestead in his cart. Finding it impossible 
to set the bone, the bird was killed, and the meat con- 
verted into steaks" and "biltong." It was said to eat 
"just like young beef, juicy and tender, with just a 
suspicion of a sweetish flavour, usually undiscoverable 
in the legitimate article." So long, however, as the pre- 
sent value of ostrich feathers is maintained in the Eng- 
lish and French markets, it is not likely that many birds 
will be killed for the sake of the meat alone. 

As we shall have occasion later on to deal fully with 
the subject of ostrich-farming, it will be unnecessary here 
to dwell upon the subject of ostrich plumes and their 
value. Suffice it to say, that in the case of wild birds 
the feathers are said to differ in quality, according to the 
locality whence they are obtained. Those of the well- 
watered and luxuriant districts are long and heavy, but 
stiff and ungraceful, owing to the thickness of the quills ; 
whilst those of the Kalahari, aud the adjoining countries, 
are shorter, lighter, and superior, having finer quills, 
which allow the feathers to droop in a graceful curve.^ 
It appears to. be generally admitted that the feathers 
produced by domesticated or artificially reared birds are 
always inferior to those of wild ones. 

From time to time experiments have been made with 
a view to test the capability of the ostrich in drawing 
and carrying burdens, but probably more from curiosity

or for amusement, than with any real intention of turn- 
ing the bird's powers in this respect to account. Accord- 
ing to Montaigne/ " L'Empereur Firmus fait meuer son 
Goche ^ des autruehca de merveilleuse grandeur, do

Dr. Sparrman, a century ago (1775), aaw mounted 
ostriches at the Cape -^ and before hira, Moore had re- 
corded his having seen an Englishman at Joar travelling 
long distances upon a bridled ostrich.^ Adanaon speaks 
of the ease and rapidity with which a large tame ostrich 
ran, first with two little blacks, and then with two full- 
grown negroes on its back, while a smaller bird, with 
equal facility, carried a single full-grown man.*

North Africa are frequently offered for sale in Calcutta, 
and that some years ago in the gardens of the Maharajah 
of Burdwan he saw one mounted by a boy. In the 
Jardin d'Acclimatation in Paris, at the present day, a 
gentleman, well known in the naturalist world, may 
occasionally be seen amusing himself by driving a little 
car drawn by an ostrich. 

At what date ostriches were first introduced into 
England we cannot with certainty state. Sir Thomas 
Browne of Norwich, writing to his son in London in 
August 1680, snys^ — *' Wee heare of two oestriges wch 
are brought from Tangier, I sawe one in the latter end 
of King James his dayes, at Greenwich, when I was a 
schoolboy. Later on he adds,' " Mr Clarke tells mee hee 
sawe 2 ostridges in London in Cromwell's time." 

In a subsequent letter, dated gth January 1682, he 
observes^ — " A great part of our newes is of the King 
of Pez and Morocco's embassadour, with his presents of 
lyons and oestridges ; " at wliich date, " there being so 
many oestridges brought over, 'tis likely some of them 
will be brought about to showe hither \i.e., to Norwich], 
as BOone as other parts out of London." 

His son kept one alive for some time. When it died 
he dissected it, and, in a letter to his father, " set downe 
what he observed on the dissection."* Sir Thomas refers 
to this as "being, I think, the first oestridge dissected 
in England, at least to any purpose.

The first of these, which, it is almost unnecessary to 
state, was for a long period the only species of the 
genus known, appears to possess the widest geographical 




range, extending, according to Dr. Cunningham (Pro, 
Zool. Soc, 1871, p. 105), from Bolivia, Paraguay, and 
South Brazil, at least as far south as the Strait of Magel- 
lan,* a space of upwards of thirty degrees. The second

from the Strait of Magellan to tlie Eio Negro, the 
boundary line between Patagonia and the Argentine 
Republic ; while, for our knowledge of the third, the 
precise habitat of which remains to be determined, we 
are indebted to Mr. Sclater'a finely illustrated article on 
the Struthioua birds living in the Zoological Society's 
Gardens, published in 1862 in the fourth volume of that 
Society's " Transactions." 

In assigning such an extensive range as above indi- 
cated to Jihm. americana. Dr. Cunningham admits that 
his views conflict with those of Mr. Darwin, who fixes 
the southern limit of this bird at a little to the south of 
the Rio Negro, observing that R. daitoini takes its place 
in Southern Patagonia. Dr. Cunningham, however, is 
able to assert positively that R. amencana extends as 
far south as the Strait of Magellan, inhabiting the same 
tracts of country as tlie latter species ; for in the course 
of his sojourn in the eastern portion of the Strait he saw 
a number of recently killed specimens in the possession 
of the Patagonian Indians ; and although he did not see 
any examples of R. darwini in the flesh, he picked up its 
characteristic white-tipped feathers in various localities 
in the plains. 

The ordinary habits of the South American ostrich 
are thus described by Mr. Darwin ■} — 

"They live on vegetable matter, such as roots and 
grass; but at Bahia Blanca I have repeatedly seen three 
or four come down at low water to the extensive mud- 
banks, which are then dry, for the sake, as the Gauehos 
say, of feeding on small fish. Although the rhea in its 
is so shy, wary, and solitarj', and although so

fleet in its pace, it la caught without much difficulty by 
the Indian or Gaucho armed with the ' bolaa.' When 
several horsemen appear in a semicircle, it becomes 
confounded, and does not know which way to escape. 
They generally prefer running againat the wind ; yet at 
the first start they expand their wings, and like a vessel 
make all sail. On one fine hot day I saw several rheas 
enter a bed of tall rushes, where they squatted con- 
cealed till quite closelv approached. It is not generally 
known that these birds readily take to the water. Mr. 
King informs me that at the bay of San Bias, and 
at Port Valdes in Patagonia, he saw them swimming 
several times from island to island. They ran into 
the water both when driven down to a point, and 
likewise of their own accord when not frightened ; the 
distance crossed was about two hundi-ed yards.^ When 
swimming, very little of their bodies appear above 
water; their necks are extended a little forward, and 
their progress is slow. On two occasions I saw some 
rheas swimming across the Santa Cruz river, where its 
course was about four hundred yards wide, and the 
stream rapid. Captain Sturt," when descending the 
Murrumbidgee, in Australia, saw two emus in the act 
of swimming. 

" The inhabitants of the country readily distinguish, 
even at a distance, the cock-bird from the hen. The 
former is larger and darker coloured,' and has a bigger 



' This obaervation ia confirmed by Dr. Cunningham, wlio states tliat 
one of the ofBcers of the "Nassau," ta which, vessel he was attauhetl oa 
naturalist, saw several of these birds on the southern shore of St, Jt^oBay, 
Strait of Magellan, escape from tlireatened danger by running into the sea.

' A Gaucho assured me that he had once seen a snow-white or albino 
variety, and that it was a moat beautiful bird.

head/ The rbea, I believe tlie cock, emits a singular, 
deep-toned, hissing note : when first I heard it, stand- 
ing in the midst of some sand-hillocka, I thought it was 
made by some wild beast, for it is a sound that one can- 
not tell whence it comes, or from how far distant. 
When we were at Babia Blanca in the months of Sep- 
tember and October, the eggs, in extraordinary numbers, 
were found all over the country. They lie either scat- 
tered and single, in which case they are never hatched, 
and are called by the Spaniards kuachos ; or they are 
collected together into a shallow excavation, which 
forms the nest.^ Out of the four nests whicli I saw, three 
contained twenty-two eggs each, a.nd the fourth twenty- 
seven. In one day's hunting on horseback sixty-four 
eggs were found ; forty-four of these were in two nests, 
and the remaining twenty scattered huachos. The 
Gauchos unanimously affirm, and there is no reason to 
doubt their statement, that the male bird alone batches 
the eggs, and for some time afterwards accompanies the 
young. The cock when on the nest lies very close ; I 
have myself almost ridden over one. It is asserted that 
at such times they are occasionally fierce, and even dan- 
gerous, and that they have been known to attack a man 
on horseback, trying to kick and leap on liim. My in- 
former pointed out to me an old man whom be had seen 
much terrified by one chasing him, I observe in Bur- 
chell's ' Travels in South Africa,' that he remarks, 
' Having killed a male ostrich, and the feathers being 
dirty, it was said by the Hottentots to be a nest-bird.' 



' In its natural attitwde, the crnnmon rhea stands about five feet bigh, c 
ftbout two feet lower than the African ostrich. 

* Thifl observation is confirmed hj Dr. Cunningham in hia " NatUK 
History of the Strait of Magellan," p. J34. 



8o THE RHEA. 

I understand that the male emu in the Zoological 
Gardens takes charge of the nest : this habit, therefore, 
seems common to the fiimily. 

" The Gauchos unanimously affirm that several females 
lay in one nest. I have positively been told that four or 
five hen-birds have been watched to go, in the middle 
of the day, one after the other, to the same nest, I 
may add, also, that it is believed in Africa that two or 
more females lay in one nest.^ Although this habit at 
first appears very strange, I think the cause may be 
explained in a simple manner. The number of eggs in 
the nest varies from twenty to forty, and even to fifty ; 
and according to Azara, sometimes to seventy or eighty. 
Now, although it is most probable, from the number 
of eggs found in one district being so extraordinarily 
great in proportion to the parent birds, and likewise 
from the state of the ovarium of the hen, that she may 
in the course of the season lay a large number, yet the 
time required must be very long. Azara states," that a 
female in a state of domestication laid seventeen eggs, 
each at the interval of three days. If the hen was 
obliged to hatch her own eggs, before the last was laid 
the first probably would be addled ; but if each laid a 
few eggs at successive periods, in different nests, and 
several hens, as is stated to be the case, combined 
together, then the eggs in one collection would be 
nearly of the same age. If the number of eggs in one 
of these nests is, a.s I believe, not greater on an average 
than the number laid by one female in the season, then 
there must be as many nests as females, and each cock

will have its fair share of the labour of incubation ; and 
that during a period when the females probably could 
not sit, from not having finished laying.^ I have before 
mentioned the great numbers of huachos or deserted 
eggs, so that in one day's hunting twenty were to be 
found in this state. It appears odd that so many should 
be wasted. Does it not arise from the difficulty ^of 
several females associating together, and finding a male 
ready to undertake the office of incubation ? It is evi- 
dent that there must at first be some degree of associa- 
tion between at least two females, otherwise the eggs 
would remain scattered over the wide plains at dis- 
tances far too great to allow of the male collecting them 
into one nest. Some authors have believed that the 
scattered eggs were deposited for the young birds to feed 
on.* This can hardly be the case in America, because 
the huachos, although often found addled and putrid, 
are generally whole." 

Captain Burton, during his travels in the " Highlands 
of Brazil," seems to have seen this bii'd but once in a wild 
Btate. On the banks of the Corrente river, opposite the 
island of Santo Antonio, he says, " An ostrich appeared 
pacing along the shore, but the people here have not yet 
[Oct. 1867] learned to kill it for its feathers,"^ In a 
footnote to this passage he adds, " The Welsh colony in 
Patagonia are buying, I am told, ema* feathers for 



' Li chten stein, however, asserts (Eeisen im Siidliehen Afrika, voL ii. 
p. 25) that the lieiis begin sitting wheti they have laid ten or twelve eggs ; 
and that they continue laying, I presume, in another nest. This appears 
to me very improbahle. He asserts that fonr or five hens associate for in- 
cubation with one cock, who sits only at night. 

* Tliia is asserted also of the African ostrich. See ante, p. 42.

threepence per pound, and expect to sell them in 
England for thirty shiltiags. In these civiliaed days, 
when no head requires to wear the colours which nature 
gave it, surely the grey plume of the American bird 
may, by bleaching and dyeing, be made to pasa for an 
Aii-ican one." 

In penning this remark, Capt. Burton was evidently 
unaware of the difference which exists in the structure 
of these feathers, which, independently of colour, would 
enable their identification by the connoisseur. 

The rhea, like other members of the ostrich family, 
is a very indiscriminate feeder, lives chiefly on grass, 
seeds, and locusts ; but, according to Dr. Cunningham, 
it appears to have a special predilection for the red 
berries of the Empetimm ruhrmn, a plant which is very 
abundant on the grassy plains where this bird Lg found. 

Mr. C. S. Smelt, late of the 98th Regiment, writing 
on " Emigration to the River Plate," ^ and describing 
the province of Buenos Ayres, says : — 

"About eight years ago (1868), when I first came to 
this part of the country, in addition to deer, we had at 
times, and more especially after the Indiana had been 
hunting on the outside camps, a very fair show of the 
South American ostrich. These wc used to hunt with 
some half-bred greyhounds that we had managed to pick 
up in the town of Buenos Ayres ; and it is difiicult to 

ema and not emu. He says (op. cit., vol. i. p. 52, note), " In the pro- 
vince of Rio Grande the word avestru$, properly the African ostrich, ia used. 
Mma is a corruption of the Arabic Ni&miA,, yet even the accurate Southey 
(vol. i. p. 129) and Gardner, to aay nothing of the vulgar herd, have cor- 
rupted it to «mu. The aborigines of the Eraiila called it A'Aanrffi or 
J'Aunrffi. According to Prince Moi (vol, iii. p. la) the Brazilians also 
know it as Touyau, and Southey adds CKwi (vol. i. p. 253). I have not 
heard either of these nords, which are pure Guarani."

MODE OF HUNTING. 



63 



conceive anything more exciting than a run after one of 
these birds. Their speed is astonishing ; they almost 
invariably run down and side on to the wind, and, if 
there is a good stiff breeze blowing, as is almost always 
the case on these pampas, they raise one wing, which 
acts as a kind of sail, and when this happens few horsea 
or dogs can live with them, and it is only by fairly 
wearing them out that they can eventually be ap- 
proached. To succeed in this, however, both horsea 
and dogs must be in excellent condition. I have often 
seen runs that lasted for an hour and a half and more, 
and the pace was almost always most trying, and, 
although there are no fences to be negotiated, the riding 
is far from being easy or free fi'om danger, as frequently 
large tracts of country have to be crossed which are 
entirely covered with tufts of high coarse grass,- where 
it ia all blind going, and again in other parts the ground 
is full of boles, and undermined by bizcachas, foxes, and 
other animals, and it is only the wonderful cleverness 
of the horses, which are thoroughly at home in this 
kind of ground, and very rarely ever make a mistake, 
that prevents many awkward accidents from happening. 
Frequently, however, one gets a run over as fine turf as 
any man would wish to ride over, where the ground is 
perfectly sound, and nothing ia to be met with to pre- 
vent the most perfect enjoyment of the sport. 

"The natives and the Indians never hunt any kind of 
game with dogs, they always use the ' bolas ' or balls. 
These are three pieces of lead, or hard heavy wood, or 
stone, rudely fashioned into a round shape, cased in raw 
hide, and attached to thongs of the same material, which 
are joined together in the centre. In usiug them they 
are swung round the head with great rapidity whilst 



64 THE RHEA. 

the horse is going at full speed, and, when withiii 
throwing distance, are launched at the game, when they 
twist round its legs, head, or wings, and completely 
cripple it, and often stun it if one of the balls happens 
to strike the head or any sensitive part. The distance 
to which these can he thrown, and the wonderful pre- 
cision which is exhibited in their use, is quite marvel- 
lous. I have seen cattle and horses stopped at a distance 
exceeding eighty yards, their hind legs having been 
firmly tied together by the winding of the balls round 
them. For cattle, of course, much larger balls are used 
than for deer and ostriches ; for the former they are 
about the size of a man's fist when clenched, and for 
the latter a little larger than pigeons' eggs. It is a 
peculiarity of the ostrich that when liard pressed it will 
gquat amongst the high grass, or any sort of covert that 
it can get to, and lie so close that it is almost impossible 
to find it, as the dogs usually overrun it some distance 
before the mistake is discovered ; in this way wc lost 
many that were dead beaten, and, though we knew that 
they were close to us, we almost invariably failed to 
find them. In running them, when the dogs get along- 
side of them, it is wonderful to see the manner in which 
they double, just as a hare does before greyhounds, but 
apparently shorter, and with greater ease, if sucli a thing 
be possible." 

On the pampas in the district of Tapalqueen on the 
south-western frontier of Buenos Ayres, the rhea is toler- 
ably numerous, and here the same writer had some ex- 
cellent sport in coursing it. 

The countr}' which it inhabits he describes as " a roll- 
ing prairie, or parapa, as it is called in South America, a 
regular succession of hill and dale, in fact, that looked

(so perfectly uniform was the undulatioo), esactly like 
the long roiling swell of mid-ocean after a heavy gale 
of wind. Not a tree to be seen, no water — save now 
and again a muddy puddle, like a duck - pond in 
England — and scarcely a hut ; almost the only signs 
of life, except the ostriches, being the small burrowing 
prairie owls." " We soon found," says Mr. Smelt, 
recounting his experiences,^ " that the report we had 
heard as to the abundance of ostriches here had not been 
exaggerated, and that in whatever direction we went, we 
were sure of finding them. After riding for about a 
mUe and a half, we viewed five bu'ds feeding in a hol- 
low at a distance of about seven or eight hundred yards 
from us, and discovered that by skirting some high grass 
to our left we should moat probably he able to get close 
to them without alarming them ; so we at once started in 
that direction, taking two of the dogs with us. 

"Before we had gone a couple of hundred yards, we 
came suddenly on an old male bird, a splendid fellow, 
and we slipped the dogs within five-and-twenty yards 
of him. Then began one of the most exciting runs it 
was ever my good fortune to witness. Away we went 
through the thick 'pajas,' or tufts of high reedy grass, 
the hounds keeping well up, and apparently rather gain- 
ing ground than otherwise. In this way we ran for two 
miles or more, when the ostrich, emerging from the 
high gi'ass, steered away across some bare hills, where 
he got the full force of a very fresh breeze that was 
blowing at the time, of which be at once took advantage, 
running down and across it in an oblique direction with

hie left wing raised, which lie made use of aa a sail. 
The pace hitherto had been good — in fact, I may say, 

without fear of exaggeration, more than good ; but now 
that he had got the wind, it was simply racing, and, in 
spite of all our efforts and those of the dogs, he seemed 
to leave us literally as though we were standing still. 
We kept pounding away, however, in pursuit as well as wc 
could for some time, when a mau who was driving cattle 
turned him to the right, and he headed straight back to- 
wards us for a few seconds before he found out his mis- 
take ; we were thus enabled to get on good terms with him 
again. After running for about fifteen minutes more, he 
began to show unmistakable signs of distress, and one of 
the dogs, a large brindled one, ranged fairly alongside, and 
was about to make a spring, when he doubled as short 
as if he had been fixed on a movable pivot, and catch- 
ing the slant of the wind, and setting his wing again, he 
was off like a flash of lightning, and leading by nearly a 
quarter of a mile, the hounds having shot lengths ahead 
in another direction before they could turn. It was 
evident, however, that he was tiring fast, and, although 
the pace was still good, we got alongside again, but with 
no better result than another double and another good 
lead for the bii-d ; and these tactics he continued to 
repeat each time we neared him, always gaining an 
immense advantage thereby. It became plain, however, 
that he could not last much longer, and eventually the 
dogs pinned him, when we rode up and gave him his 
cou<p de grdce, cutting off his wings as trophies. He 
was a noble bird, and a most gallant struggle he made 
for hia life, and I feel quite certaux that if he had not 
been turned by the cowherd he would have made good 
hia escape, for both dogs and horses, and their riders too. 



HUNTING ON THE PAMPAS. 6? 

were pretty nearly pumped out when that happened. 
The time was over an hour, and a good part of it at 
racing pace, and the panting sides and distressed looks 
of our animals told us plainly enough that it was useless 
to think of looking for more game till we had got fresh 
cattle ; so, after allowing a short breathing time, and 
lighting our pipes, we turned homewards well satisfied 
with our morning's sport. 

" In the afternoon we made up our minds to try our 
luck again ; so about three o'clock we sallied forth with 
fresh horses and dogs, and after a ride of nearly a league, 
had a find, and were fortunate enough to slip our dogs 
to a very good start. The bird, which was a full-grown 
one, and seemingly as large as the one we had killed in 
the morning, led us at a splitting pace for a good five 
miles across very fine open camp, when he turned to a 
large tract of ' pajas,' through which we followed him 
for about fifteen minutes, when I and my friend both 
came to terrible grief at very nearly the same moment. 
An evil fate had led us across a place which a colony of 
bizcachas had inhabited at some former time, and before 
we knew it we were in the middle of theii' holes, which 
■were completely hidden by the grass, and our horses, 
being by this time pretty well blown, came down on 
their heads, depositing each of us gracefully on mother 
earth. This finale was ludicrous, but extremely aggrar 
vating. However, there was nothing for it but to take 
things quietly, as by the accident we were hopelessly 
thrown out, even if we could have seen the course, 
which the height of the grass rendered impossible ; so 
we sat down, and lighting our pipes, waited to see what 
would turn up, and in about half an hour the dogs re- 
retumed, dead beaten, but evidently without having 



68 THE KHEA. 

killed. Most probably tLe ostrich was lying down 
hidden in Bome thick covert, as these birds frequently 
do when hard pressed, and the hounds had OYcrrun him. 
So ended our first essay at ostrich-hunting in this part 
of the country ; and most delighted we were with it, 
notwithstanding its rather ignominious conclusion. 

" We spent several more days in pursuit of the same 
game, on one occasion killing three, whilst on another 
we had a run for nearly two hours after a splendid bird 
over frightfully bad ground, almost all of it being blind 
going. Our liorses, however, never made a mistake. 
The pace was quite as good as we liked, sometimes 
rather better; and we bad hunted our quarry very 
nearly to a standstill when we lost him in a most 
mysterious manner, and although we beat most care- 
fully all round, we never found him again. Of course 
he was skulking in the long grass somewhere close to us, 
and possibly we might almost have trodden on him 
several times ; but he never made a move, and we were 
eventually compelled by the darkness to relinquish our 
search in despair. We succeeded altogether in bagging 
eleven ostriches, although of course we bunted many 
more, which, notwithstanding that our horses were good 
and in excellent condition, we were unable to give an 
account of. This, however, is no matter for surprise, 
when one takes into consideration the enormous speed 
they exhibit when they catch a good wind, and their 
inveterate babit of skulking in thick grass when hard 
pressed. Their usual mode is to run slantwise across 
the wind with one wing set sail-fashion ; but I have 
repeatedly seen them run dead before it with both 
raised, much in the same manner as a swan sets his - 
wings when swimming before a gentle breeze." 



DOMESriCATION: 69 

From its hardy nature and omnivorous liabits it ia 
easily kept in confinement. Dr. Cunningbam, when 
viaitiug tlie Governor at Punta Arenas, or Sandy Point, 
Patagonia, saw two young rheaa which had been turned 
into an enclosure. At the date of hia visit they had just 
succeeded in making their escape, and rushing up and 
down the kitchen-garden, pursued by the Governor's 
secretary, foi-nished a most laughable spectacle ; for, ap- 
parently determined to improve their unwonted oppor- 
tunities to the uttermost, they ran about snapping off 
the heatls of the young cabbages and potatoes.^ 

Captain Burton states ^ that in the grounds of the Com- 
endador Ferreira Lage at Juiz de F6ra, he saw several 
of these birds in captivity ; and there can be no doubt 
that were ostrich-farming cairied on in South America 
as in Cape Colony, it might be made a most profitable 
buaineaa. Unfortunately, it would seem tliat at present 
few persons in South America have given the matter 
much attention, and, as a rule, the feathers, which are 
largely exported to the United States and Europe, are 
plucked from birds which have been killed by hundreds 
for the purpose. So great has been the slaughter during 
the last few yeai-s, a^'eraging, as we are informed, fropi 
300,000 to 500,000 per annum, tJiat one may now ride

Buenoa Ayres, writing to us under date 14th March 
1876, says : — 

" The American ostrich, or rhea, only exists in this 
province beyond the Indian frontier, while it is plen- 
tiful in the provinces of Entre Rios, Santa F^, and 
Cordova. It exiata in large numbers in the adjoin- 
ing republic of Uruguay, but nowhere is it ' farmed,' 
except on the most modest scale. The meat is palat- 
able, and frequently eaten when beef or mutton ia not 
attainable. 

"The birds lay from twenty to thirty eggs in a nest, 
and these are commonly hatched by the male. The 
eggs are very good eating, as I know from personal 
experience." 

In another letter, dated 3d June 1876, the same gentle- 
man writes :— 

" The ostrich of these countries is of an inquiring turn 
of mind. When one of a flock is killed, the others do 
not take themselves off, but remain near their dead 
companion. I have attracted them within gunshot by 
lying on my stomach and moving my legs slowly in 
the air, when the birds come up cautiously to see what 
the moving object can be." 

Through the kindness of Mr. Bridgctt we have been 
favoured by Mr. Richard Newton of Bueno.'? Ayres with 
the following additional information: — 

" The American ostrich is found in most parts of the 
Argentine and Uruguay Republics, whether sandy, flat, 
or hilly, but seems to prefer grassy country with cover. 
It lives on grass, seeds, and vegetables, and is very fond 
of locusts. The natives and Indians hunt them, and 
some foreigners shoot them. The natives and Indians 
are very fond of wild ostrich-meat. The eggs also are 



good eating, and vary from a pound and a half to a 
pound and three-quarters in weight. The birds are 
easily reared and domesticated, but are apt to wander 
away at breeding-time if not looked after. It has been 
fouod that if the eggs are taken about a fortnight before 
hatching, and put in boxes wrapped up in wool in a 
room, they will hatch very well without the loas of a 
single one. There is no ostrich -farming on the River 
Plate, eseept on a small scale, for the sake of the eggs. 
The law here prohibits the killing of birds during the 
breeding season, but unfortunately it is almost a dead 
letter. The annual slaughter {as before remarked) is 
enormous." 

The export tables of 1874 show the quantities and 
value of ostrich feathers despatched from Ai'gentine 
ports during the year to be as follows : —

,, Other Countries, 21 43,689

The valuation is at the rate of a dollar, or four shillings, 
per pound. Owing to the slaughter of the birds, there 
has been a marked decline in the exportation of feathers. 
For example, the export from the single Custom-house of 
Buenos Ayres in 1872 was sixty-one tons, whereas in 
1874 it fell to forty-six tons. 

In 1872 the trade with England was four times greater 
than in 1874. 

M. Carel, of Havre, one of the largest importers of 
South American ostrich feathers, has most obligingly 
furnished us with the following additional details : — 



THE RHEA. 



" We receive annually," he saya, " about 35,000 kilos, 
which represents in value about 1,200,000 francs, or 
^^48,000. Of this quantity, about half is ordinarily ex- 
ported. These feathers, which come from Banda Oriental, 
Bahia Blanca, Entre Eios, and in smaller quantities from 
Patagonia, an'ive here in the same state as when they reach 
the markets at Monte Video and Buenos Ayres. They 
are packed by the natives, but it sometimes, although 
rarely, happens that a particularly fine parcel is sorted 
and re-packed at the port whence it is shipped. I do 
not know what quantity is sent direct from La Plata to 
New York, but I imagine it must be much less than what 
we receive here." 

Although the rhea is commonly termed the South 
American ostrich, and quite as erroneously the emu, its 
feathers are known in the trade as Vautoxir, to distin- 
guish them from those of the African bird. The white 
and half- white ones are called gerbes Indiennes, or Indian 
sheaves ; the dai-k -greys, which are by far the most nume- 
rous, are tied up in bundles, and sold as feather-brooms. 

The notion of acclimatising the rhea in Europe was 
long ago mooted, and attempts have been made from 
time to time, which have proved more or less successful. 
M. Vavaseur made the experiment in France, and re- 
ported that there was no difficulty in domesticating it. 
Having spent fifteen years in the interior of the republic 
of Uruguay, where the bird was at that time common, 
he had ample opportunities of making himself acquainted 
with its habits and mode of life. His account of the 
^ species, which was published ' with a view to the i

tication and acclimatisation of the bird in France, is so 
full of information derived from personal observation of 
the species in a wild state, that we cannot do better than 
furnish the reader with the following extracts : — 

"Les savanes immenses et tout k fait plates de la 
r^publique Argentine {Pampas), celles des provinces 
d'Entre-Rios et de Corrientes, et les plaines ondul^es de 
la r^publique de TUruguay sont les lieux oil se trouve 
plus cbmmun^ment cet oiseau, qui, au contraire, est rare 
au Paraguay. 

" Les bandes de nandous {bandadas de Avestruzes) se 
composent de dix, quinze et quelquefois jusqu'a vingt 
femelles conduites par un seul m&le {el gallo), qui 
marche presque toujours k leur tete, et facile h, recon-

g^n^ralement, et je partage cette opinion, que I'oiseau ne 
se donne pas la peine de fa9onner ce trou, mais qu'il 
profite de ceux que creusent dans la campagne, avec 
leurs pieds de devant, les taureaux, pour en tirer des 
nuages de poussifere dont ils aiment k s'envelopper. Le 
nombre des ceufs qu'on rencontre le plus ordinairement 
dans ces vastes nids est de vingt-cinq k trente ; mais il 
n'est pas rare d'en trouver jusqu'k soixante et m^me 
quatre-vingts. On ignore le nombre d'oeufs que pent 
produire chaque femelle ; mais on s'accorde k penser que 
ces ^normes nichees sont dues k plusieurs femelles appar- 
tenant au m^me m&le, qui viennent pondre dans le m^me 
trou/ Ces oeufs, d'un blanc jauntee, k surface lisse et 
polie, k coquille trfes dure, sont allonges, d'une jolie 
forme, et presque de la grosseur de la t^te d'un enfant. 
Quoique moins d^licats que les oeufs de poule, ils sont 
bons k manger, et offrent une grande ressource aux gens 
de la campagne, qui les mangent cuits sous la cendre et 
en omelettes. Comme ils se conservent trfes longtemps 
sans se gAter, on en fait de grandes provisions ; aussi la 
trouvaille d'un nid d'autruche est-elle consid^rde comme 
une bonne aubaine. 

" II n'est pas vrai, comme on I'a pr^tendu, que ces 
oeufs ^closent sans incubation et par la seule chaleur du 
soleil. Le nandou couve ses oeufs. L'opinion gdn^rale 
dans le pays est que le m41e seul se charge de ce soin ;

In England, recent experiments liave shown that the 
bird will not only live and thrive in our variable climate, 
but will even breed here while in a state of semi-con- 
finement. 

Mr. Walter Trevelyan of Shepton Mallet, Somerset- 
shire, thus describes the result of an experiment made 
by him with three rheas, a male and two females, which 
had been imported from the River Plate.^ 

"They were brought home in Jidy 1875; probably 
hatched in January that year, or December 1S74, and 
when they arrived were about three-parts grown. Thej'

were at onee put into a field of nine acres, where they 
have since remained. The field adjoins a farmyard, 
and during the autumn and winter they were usually 
driveUj or rather enticed, into the yard, and, if possible, 
into a shed. We could not always get them in, and 
have several timea been obhged to leave them out in 
heavy snow. By February they were always left out at 
night. One of the birds being larger aud darker round 
the neck than the others, we set him down for a cock, 
a surmise which proved correct, as about the end of 
March or beginning of April he became rather savage, 
running at us with open mouth, and continually utter- 
ing his note of defiance (boo-o6-6o-6, a loug way down 
his throat, with his mouth shut), a very deep note, 
but one that can be heard a long distance. In the 
second week of May he was seen to pair, and wan- 
dered about evidently in search of a place to make a 
nest. On 15th May the first egg was laid in a slight 
hollow, which he had enlarged and deepened by scraping. 
On the 1 6th and 1 7th he was restless, and made a nest 
in a different part of the field. "We drove him out of 
the new nest and filled it up with sticks and stones. On 
the 1 8th an egg was laid in the open ; this we carefully 
removed without touching it (we- afterwards found that 
he cared as little as a barn-door fowl for hia eggs being 
touched), and placed it by the first in the nest. This 
was the only egg laid out of the nest untLL one to be 
mentioned presently. We put posts and a single rail 
round the nest to keep off the cows. On the 25th of 
May eight eggs were laid, and the cock began to sit. 
He was very uncertain about feeding ; the first time was 
usually about 8 a.m. Some days he would come off the 
nest four or five times, sometimes only once ; sometimes 



A CCLIMA TISA TION IN ENGLAND. 8 1 

Le did not come to be fed, but ran round the field to 
stretch hia legs. On the 5th of June there were eighteen 
eg^, and on this day I saw him pair with one of the hens. 
This was the only time he was observed to do so after 
they began laying. On the 14th June there were twenty- 
three eggs, and on this morning one of the hens was 
tossed by a cow, and so injured that we killed her; she 
then had a dozen egga inside her. The birds were so 
tame they would peck flies off the cows and ponies. I 
have seen one peek a hair out of the end of a eow's tail 
and swallow it I I forgot to say that before pairing ths 
cock ran the cattle, so we were obliged to take the milk- 
cow away for a few days till he was quieter. The 
twenty-seventh and twenty-eighth egga were laid on 
the 3d and 4th July; these I took away. On the 6th 
July a young bird and part of a shell were found about 
fifteen yards from the nest, and the hen was seen peck- 
ing at them. The hen was then shut up in the yard, 
and there, on the 7th July, she laid the twenty-ninth 
and last egg. 

"On Sunday morning, the forty-sixth day from the 
cock commencing to sit, all was excitement, for the cock 
behaved in an unusual way ; he left tlie nest on the 
wrong side (he usually came towards the house, where 
he was fed), and went back again after walking round 
the nest for a few minutes three times ; the fourth 
time, 10 A.M., he marched off as proud as a peacock, 
with four young ones following at his heels. We went to 
see the nest ; we did not move the eggs, but as far as wc 
could see none appeared to be cracked. The cock did 
not go back to the nest. At twelve o'clock the gardener 
was standing by the nest looking over the rails, when 
two more came out, bursting the shells with a crack. 



89 THE RHEA. 

One of these the cock received with open arms, running 
to meet him; the other was very weak, and he was 
taken into the fire till the afternoon, when he too was 
given back to the cock (he has a contracted foot, and 
walks upon his kuncklea). When we found the cock 
had entirely deserted the neat, five eggs were placed 
under three Lens- — one, two, two. In the evening the 
gardener again went to the uest, took up one of the eggs 
and broke a piece out, he saw no sign of life, and left it. 
On Monday morning at 1 1 a.m., I went to look at the 
nest, saw this egg broken, and knelt down to look at it. 
I saw that it breathed regularly but weakly. The sun 
was then hot, ao I left it where it was, and at i p.m. 
the breathing was much stronger. At 5 p.m. I went to 
look at it again, and found it weaker, so put it in au 
oven, where it soon began to make the cry of a young 
bird, and finding it unable to break the shell, I let it out 
at 7 P.M., thirty-three hours after the cock had left the 
nest. It was very weak, but was kept by the fire and 
lived till yesterday, July 19th. I mention this to show 
the extraordinary vitality of a rhea's egg. I have taken 
away all the eggs and blown as many as I oould ; a few 
were addled, the rest had birds in all stages in them. 
On Monday, July 1 7, the hen that had one egg under bar 
hatched it. This morning, July 20, another was hatched. 
These birds were at once given to the cock, so he now 
has eight young ones running with him. We may hatch 
more, as there are still tliree eggs under hens. If I ever 
have the luck to get the old cock to sit again, I shall 
know how to batch most of the eggs when he has left. 
I have not let the hen loose, as I have not had time to 
watch her myself. They will not be moved at present. 
I think when they are moved they can be driven up an

incline into a very low spring luggage-cart that lia3 
a hood to it." 

Nor 13 this an isolated instance of the reproduction 
of the rhea in this country. A gentleman at Chippen- 
ham, in the adjoining county of Wilts, turned out a 
pair of these birds into his park, and during the past 
summer (1876) succeeded in rearing seven young ones. 
"Writing to announce his success, he says :* — 

"Seventeen eggs were laid altogether; twelve were 
left in the nest, and five removed and put under com- 
mon fowls. The male bird sat for forty days exactly, 
and now takes sole charge of the young ones. His call 
is peculiar, a snapping of the bill, to which the young 
ones reply by a low and plaintive whine, something 
like that of a small puppy. Though so young, they 
can now {July 1876) run as fast as an old cock phea- 
sant. The hen-bird does not seem pleased with her new 
family, and we were obliged to exclude her by passing 
her through the hurdles, and she now has betaken her- 
self to the other end of the park, but pays occasional 
visits to her mate. The same pair have laid eleven, 
ten, and twenty eggs in each of the last three years, but 
until this year the male never offered to incubate." This 
gentleman concludes his observations with the remark 
that " no bird seems hardier or better able to stand the 
wet and cold of our winters, and no bird can be more 
ornamental or harmless when at liberty." 

He says nothing of its utility for food, but to judge 
from its herbivorous propensity, and from the accounts 
of the writers whom we have quoted, there seems to be 
no reason why a young rhea, if properly fed and cared 




84 THE RHEA. 

for, should not prove as good eating as a young turkey. 
The same remark applies, as will be seen later, to the 
Australian emus and the cassowaries. 

In France, M. Quatrefages goes so far as to say^ — 
" II faut que des bandes de Nandous (Khea) et de 
Cassours s'^battent dans nos basses-cours. Alors, mais 
seulement alors, la Soci^t^ d'Acclimatation pourra se 
dire satisfaite" ! 

But he qualifies this remark by adding truly — " Pour 
en arriver Ik, la perseverance et le temps sont des ele- 
ments necessaires."

DAKWIN'S RHEA^Rkea darwini, GoULD. 

Described by Mr, Gould from a specimen obtained by Mr. Danrin in 
Patagonia — Its diaLinguisbing cimractets— Difference in tlie egg — Mr. 
Darwin's account of it — Its distribution, so far as ascertained — Its 
habits and mode of nesting — Dr. Conningbam's eiperience — Mode of 
bunting by the Fatagoniaos. 

This bird, aa already remarked, was first scientifically 
described by Mr, Gould in the " Proceedings " of the 
Zoological Society for 1837, from a specimen procured 
by Mr. Darwin at Port Desire, on the east coast of 
Patagonia. 

It differs from the commoner species in its smaller 
size and shorter legs, which are feathered to the tarsus, 
and in having the plumage mottled, or less uniform in 
colour. Mr. Darwin, in his most entertaining narrative

" When at the Rio Negro, in Northern Patagonia, I 
repeatedly heard the Gauchos talking of a very rare bird 
which they called Ave^Tuz petise. They described it as 
being less than the common rhea (which is there abun- 
dant), but with a very close general resemblance. They 
said its colour was dark and mottled, and that its legs

were shorter, and feathered lower down than those of the 
common rbea. It is more easily caught by the ' bolas ' 
than any other species. The few inhabitants who bad 
seen both kinds affirmed that they coxild distinguish 
them apart from a long distance. The eggs of the small 
species appeared, however, more generally known; and 
it was remarked, with surprise, that tbey were very little 
less than those of the rbea, but of a slightly different 




form, and with a tinge of pale blue.' This species occurs 
most rarely on the plains bordering the Eio Negro, but 
about a degree and a half further south they are tolerably 
abundant. When at Port Desire, in Patagonia (lat. 48°), 
Mr. Martens shot an ostrich ; and I looked at it, forget- 
ting at the moment, in the most unaccountable manner. 



' The egga of the common rhea when first laid ate creamy yellovrish

the whole subject of the Petise, and thought it was a 
not full-grown bird of the common sort. It was cooked 
and eaten before my memory returned. Fortunately, the 
head, neck, legs, wings, many of the larger feathers, aud 
a large part of the akin, had been preserved; and from 
these a very nearly perfect specimen has been put together, 
and is now exhibited in the museum of the Zoological 
Society. Mr. Gould, in describing this new species, has 
done me the honour of calling it after my name. 

" Among the Patagonian Indians in the Strait of Ma- 
gellan, we found a half- Indian, who had lived some years 
with the tribe, but had been born in the northern pro- 
vinces. I asked him if he had ever heard of tlie Aves- 
truz petisef He answered by saying, '^Vhy, there are 
none others in these Southern countries,' He informed 
me that the number of eggs in the nest of the Petise is 
considerably less than in that of the other kind, namely, 
not more than fifteen on an average ; but he asserted 
that more than one female deposited them. At Santa 
Cruz we saw several of these birds. They were exces- 
sively wary : I think they could see a person approach- 
ing when too far off to be distinguished themselves. In 
ascending the river, few were seen ; but in our quiet 
and rapid descent, many, in pairs and by iovxs or fives, 
were observed. It was remarked that this bird did not 
expand its wings when first starting at full speed, after 
the manner of the Northern kind. In conclusion, I may 
observe, that the Wiea amet-icana inhabits the country 
of La Plata as far as a little south of the Rio Negro in 
41 lat,, and that the Rhea darwini takes its place in 
Southern Patagonia, the part about the Eio Negro being 
neutral territory. M. D'Orbigny, when at the Rio 
Negro, made great exertions to procure this bird, but

never had the good fortune to succeed.^ Dobrizhoffer 
long ago was aware of there being two kinda of 
ostriches. He says,^ " You must know, moreover, that 
emu9 differ in size and habits in different tracts of 
land ; for those that inhabit the plains of Buenos Ayres 
and Tucuman are larger, and have black, white, and 
grey feathers; those near to the Strait of Magellau are 
smaller and more beautiful, for their white feathers are 
tipped with black at the extremity, and their black ones 
in like manner terminate in white." 

Dr. Cunningham states,' that although on several 
occasions he had an opportunity of examiuing specimens 
of rheas which had been killed, he never met with one 
of the Rhea darwini in Patagonia, although he fi-e- 
qnently picked up its feathers on the plains. 

Commander Chaworth Musters, K.N., who spent a 
year amongst the Tehuelches in the interior of Pata- 
gonia, and adopted the nomad habits with the costiune 
and manners of the tribe, thus describes their mode of 
hunting tliis bird and the guanaco.* 

" Two men start off, and ride at a gallop round a cer- 
tain area of country, lighting tires at intervals to mark 
their track. After the lapse of a few minutes, two 
others are despatched, and so on, until only a few are 
left with the Cacique. These spread themselves out in

labours of this neturaliat, who during the years 1825 to 1833, traversed

result of xvhich has since been published on a scale of mngnificence whicb,

a crescent, closing in and narrowing the circle on a 
point where those first started have by this time arrived. 
The crescent rests upon a base-line formed by the slowly 
proceeding line of women, children, and baggage-horses. 
The ostriches and herds of guanaco run from the ad- 
vancing party, but are checked by the pointsmen, and 
when the circle is well closed in, are attacked with the 
bolas, two men frequently chasing the same animal 
from different sides. The dogs also assist in the chase ; 
but the Indians are so expert with the bolas, that unless 
their horses are tired, or they happen to have gambled 
away their bolas, the dogs are not much called into use. 
Puma are frequently found in the circles, and quickly 
despatched by a blow on the head from a ball. The 
Indian law of division of the game prevents all de- 
putes. The meat of the ostrich is highly prized, espe- 
cially if the giant bird be in good condition. Owiog to 
the entii'e absence of farinaceous food, the Tehuelches 
devour a great quantity of fat, as indeed every one must 
do in uncivilised countries. After the hunt, a great 
feast is held ; a portion of the meat is reserved for the 
women and children, then a pipe is handed round, sad- 
dles are readjusted, and the party adjourn to the toldos, 
which by this time have been pitched and arranged by 
the women. Unless ostriches are very scarce, or the 
Indians have a peculiarly strong longing for blood, they 
do not kill the guanaco, but its flesh is excellent.' The

meat of the haunches is generally cut off iu thin slices, 
lightly salted, and dried in the sun. "When thoroughly 
dried, it is roasted in the ashes, pounded between two 
stones, and mixed with ostrich or other grease ; this pre- 
paration, like pemmican, is very useful for a man going 
a long journey, as it can he carried in a small compass, 
and a mere handful satisfies the appetite." 

The party to which Mr. Musters had attached himself 
made their way slowly up the valley of the Rio Chico, 
which was still frozen over. They journeyed and hunted 
in the teeth of a piercing wind, and with occasioual 
showers of snow. The vaUey sometimes opened out into 
wide grass-covered plains, dotted with incense-bushes, 
then rose again in huge bare ridge-and-furrow-like undu- 
lations. Occasionally there occurred patches of swampy 
ground with frozen lagnnes, and here and there open 
springs, the resort of numerous waterfowl. Bare and 
rugged hills rose abruptly out of the plains ; and fre- 
quently a high hill of basalt, assuming the appearance 
of a ruined castle, closed in the bends of the winding 
river. 

" A grander sight," says Mr. Musters, "can hardly be 
presented by the animal world than the flight of a great 
herd of ostriches, as they race with incouceivable speed, 
with their strong feet spurning the earth and the sand, 
and their brilliant watchful eyes shaded with eyelashes 
like slanting rain. The Patagonian rhea, or ostrich, is 
smaller and of lighter colour than the American. These

birds are very swift of foot, and run with their wings 
closed, while the other speeiea invariably spread theirs.^ 
The wing-feathers are sold for a dollar a pound at 
Buenos Ayres. The neck is used as a pouch for salt or 
tobacco ; from the sinews of the leg thongs for bolas arc 
constructed ; the grease from the breast and back is 
secured in bags formed of the skin; the meat is more 
nourishing than that of any other animal in the country; 
and the eggs form a staple commodity of food during 
the months of September, October, and November. The 
male bird is swifter than the female. When any danger 
appears, they will feign to be hurt, in order to attract 
the attention of the hunter from their brood. Their 
usual food consists of short grass and the seeds of vari- 
ous shrubs. They possess great power of sight. If met 
or obstructed by horsemen in their line of ilight, they not 
unfrequently squat so closely that they can scarcely be 
distinguished from the surrounding rocks, as the greyish 
colour of their plumage so closely resembles the almost 
universal aspect of the Pampas of Patagonia, Although 
not webfooted, they can swim sufficiently well to pass 
a river.' In the winter season, the Indians frequently 
drive them into the water, where, their legs getting 
numbed with cold, they are drifted to the shore by the 
current, and easily captured. In snowy weather they 
are also readUy taken, as their eyes appear to be affected 
by the glare of the white snow, and their saturated 
plumage becomes heavier. Contrary to the usual rule 
among birds, the male sits on the eggs, and when

tlie cliickens are batclied, assumes the charge of the 
brood." 

The eggs, of which we have seen specimena in the 
possession of Mr. A. D. Bartlett, are of a creamy white 
colour, but with the surface of the shell more pitted than 
in the case of R. ameincana, and as regards shape, more 
pointed at both ends. 

It may be worth noting here that in the Zoological 
Society's Gardens in 1862, the young male rhea upon 
which ilr, Sclater founded his species macrorhyncha, 
paired with a female Rhea americana; the male bird 
making the nest, arranging the eggs, and performing 
the whole duties of incubation.-^ Two young ones were 
reared. In 1863 the male bird commenced to sit on the 
8th May, at which time there were only two eggs in the 
nest. The female, however, continued to lay, and de- 
posited altogether twelve eggs.'' 

The eggs of the rhea batched in the incubator required 
thirty-five days to hatch, which is somewhat less than 
the time usually occupied when hatched in the natural 
way.

THE LONG-BILLED RHEA—Rhm macrorhyncha, Sclateb. 

Its diBtinguiEhing characters aa pointed out by Mr. Sclnter — Possibly only 
H vaiiety of Bkta amirvM-no. — Its habitat at present undetermined. 



In November 1858, a young rhea was pureliased iu 
Liverpoolfor the Zoological Society of London, which, on 
arriving at maturity, seemed to possess certain characters 
which, on comparison, were not observable either iu the 
common, or Darwin'srhea; and in the " Proceedings " of 
the Society for i860 (p. 207), the secretary, Mr. Sclater, 
described it under the above title aa a new species. 




He says {1. c.) : — " The long-billed rhea {Rhea 
macrorki/7icha, as I propose to call it) is a much smaller 



THE LONG-BILLED RHEA. 



bird than the common rhea. The example in the 
gardens, a male, stands about six inches lower than the 
two females of the American rhea, which are in its com- 
pany, and we may reasonably suppose that the female is 
proportionally sraalier. The bill is much larger than 
that of the common rhea, and the head-feathers are 
larger and more closely flattened down. On the other 
hand, the tarsi are much more slender, and the toes much 
shorter. The thighs are less thickly clothed than in the 
common rhea ; but the scutellation of the tarsi seems to 
be nearly the same in both these birds, and offers a marked 
contrast to that of Rliea darwini, in which the tarsi are 
for the greater part covered with reticulated scales. 

"The feathers of the body are longer in the long- 
billed rhea, and curve round it, hiding the outline in a 
manner not observable in the common rhea. 

" With regard to colouring, the new species is also very 
different, being of a brownish-grey mixed with black, 
and altogether much darker than Rhea americana. The 
top of the head and streak at the back of the neck in 
particular ai'C of a deep black." The bird has since died. 

We confess that we have some slight misgiving as to 
the specific distinctness of this biid, and are inclined to 
think that, as no further specimens have been procured, 
it may after all prove to be merely an individual vai-iety 
of Rhea amei'icmia. Ornithologists must have observed 
that the bills of young birds are often developed much 
sooner than any other part of their anatomy, and hence, 
for a time, appear much larger in proportion to the size 
of the birds than do those of the parents. Should we 
be mistaken, however, in supposing that Rhea macror- 
hyncha is not a valid species, its haunts and habits 
remain to be ascertained.

A cassowary of some species is stated to esiat in the 
Solomon Islands {cf. Huttou, "Ibis." 1869, p. 352), and 
if this be so, it is probably a species distinct from any 
of the above-named ; but the only specimen alleged to 
have been thence received has proved on examination 
to be Casuanus bennetti. 

The existence of a cassowary in Australia was first 
made known in 1854 by the late Mr, Thomas Wall, who, 
like many other explorers of that vast continent, perished

for want of food in its iuhospitable wikla whilst in 
pursuit of scieotific knowledge. The Bpecimen first 
described by him was shot near Cape York, where, in the 
deep gullies, well-nigh inaccessible, at the base of high 
hills, the species was found running in parties of seven 
or eight. This specimen unfortunately was lost at Wey- 
mouth Bay, as we learn from Mr. Carron,' one of the 
survivors of Kennedy's ill-fated expedition, to which 
Mr. Thomas Wall was the accredited naturalist. The 
following description, however, by Mr. Wall, was pub- 
lished by his brother, Mr. William Sheridan Wall (at 
that time Curator of the Australian Museum at 
Sydney), in the "Illustrated Sydney Herald" of June 
3, 1854:'— 

" This cassowary, when erect, stands about five feet 
high ; the head is without feathers, but covered with a 
blue skin, and, like the emu, is almost without wings, 
having mere rudiments ; the body is thickly covered 
with dark-brown wiry feathers ; on the head is a large 
prominence or helmet of a bright red colour,* and to the 
neck ai'e attached, like bells, six or eight round fleshy 
balls of bright blue and scarlet, which give the bird a 
very beautiful appearance. 

" The first, and indeed the only, specimen obtained of 
the Australian cassowary was unfortunately left at Wey-

which ia liora-colour, aa well as in r^ard to the colour of the neck-wattles, 
which are blue. See Krefft, " Ibia," 1869, pp. 348, 349. 

It ahould be observed that Mr. W. S. Wall liad no specimen before him 
to describe, but took his description secondhand from Mr. Carron, who 
returned from tlie eipeditiou. after the specimen Lad been lost, and whose 
inemorj- as reganls the precise distribution of the colours about the head 
and neck of the bird may well have failed him.

mouth. Bay, and has not been recovered. Mr. Wall, 
being most anxious for its preservation, had secured it 
in a canvaa bag, and carried it with him to the spot 
where, unfortunately for science, it was lost. In the 
ravine where the bird was killed, as well as other deep 
and stony valleys of that neighbourhood, it was seen 
runnuig in companies of seven or eight. On that part 
of the north-eastern coast, therefore, it is probably 
plentiful, and will be met with in all the deep gullies at 
the base of high hills. The flesh was eaten and found 
to be delicious; a single leg afforded more substantial 
food than ten or twelve hungry men could dispose of at 
a single meal. The bird possesses great strength in its 
legs, and makes use of it in the same manner as the 
emu. Its whole build is more strong and heavy than 
the latter bird. It is very wary, but its presence may be 
easily detected by its utterance of a peculiarly loud note, 
which is taken up and echoed along the gullies ; and it 
could be easily killed with a rifle." 

Twelve years later, namely, in 1866, Mr. W, J. Scott, 
who had au extensive sheep-run iu the Valley of Lagoons, 
on the Upper Burdakin river, about one hundred milea 
west from Rockingham Bay, communicated to the Zoo- 
logical Society of London the fact that in the last- 
named locality the bird was well known to the natives 
as the black emu, but that it was esceediugly difficult 
to obtain. Mr. Scott himself had never met with one, 
but he forwarded a bundle of feathers belonging to a 
bird of this species which had been taken out of a native 
hut in the neighbourhood.^

Johnson, while on a visit to Koekingham Bay, shot ii 
cassowary in the Gowrie Creek Scrub, which he pre- 
served and presented to the museum at Sydney.^ This 
was subsequently identified with Wall's species by Mr. 
W. Carron (c/l P. Z. S., 1867, pp. 473, 474), one of the 
survivors of his ill-fated expedition. Ultimately, Mr. 
Eamsay reported (P. Z. S., 1868, p, 388) that casso- 
waries had been seen in the neighbourhood of Rock- 
ingham Bay, and through the exertions of Mr. Charles 
Scott of Queensland, brother to Mr. W. J. Scott 
above-mentioned, a very fine and perfect skin of C. 
australis was forwarded in 1868 to the Zoological 
Society, from which Mr. Gould prepared his beautiful 
coloured plate in the Supplement to his " Birds of 
Australia," and the acquisition of this specimen enabled 
Mr. Sclater at once to set at rest all doubts which 
might have existed as to the distinctness of this species 
from the cassowary of Ceram, C galeatus. 

The distinguishing features of these two species, as 
pointed out by him,* are as foUowa : — 

The crest of the Australian bird is of a difi'erent shape 
from that of C. galeatus, rising much more erect from 
the head, and attaining a much greater development 
than in even the largest examples of the latter species. 
In C australis, also, the crest is extremely compressed 
towards the edges, terminating in two thin lamime of 
horn united in a medial line. The tarsi are thicker and

stouter, and the elongated claw on tlie inner toe of 
australis is straight and much more developed. The 
wing in australis ia composed of four or five strong 
harbless quills, and terminated, as in other species of 
the genus, by a well-developed claw. The gular caruncle 
appears rather to resemble that of galeatus, being divided 
nearly down to its base, and terminating in two red flaps ; 
but the colour of the naked throat and fore-neck is a 
fine cobalt blue, instead of dull purple as in C. galeatiLS. 

From an account furnished by Dr. Mueller of Mel- 
bourne,^ it appears that the Australian cassowaiy keeps 
almost entirely to the more open parts of the scrub, and 
seldom ventures far out on the plains. During the 
months of July, August, and September, its food con- 
sists chiefly of an egg-shaped, blue-skinned beiTy. This, 
together with herbage, probably forms its chief diet, at 
least for that portion of the year ; but at present its habits 
have been so little observed, that hardly anything is 
known concerning them. In the stomach of a specimen 
shot by Mr. G. H. Davidson of Rockingham Bay was a 
fruit resembling a lemon, hut with a stone inside.^ 

Mr. W. Carron, the only sm-vivor of Kennedy's ex- 
pedition, and who was jiresent when Walls' specimen of 
the Australian cassowary was shot, says* that this 
species appears to confine itself to the gullies in the 
thick jungles with the brush turkeys and jungle-fowl, 
feeding on the various fruits found there, even swallow- 
ing the large seeds of Castanospemium and Pandanus.

by the specimen of C. australis, so that Mr. Sclater's 
statement that the latter species attains to a larger size 
is confirmed. Professor Flower, however, considers that 
it is not safe to lay too much stress on slight difierences 
in the shape of the horny casque, as it varies not only 
with age, but also considerably in the three (all perfectly 
adult) examples of C. galeatus examined by him. 

Although Casuarius galeatus has more than once 
bred in the gardens of our Zoological Society, the same 
success has not resulted with the Australian species. In 
Paris, however, in the Jardin des Plantes, the Austra- 
lian cassowary has layed its eggs and reared its young, 
and it was remarked by M. Geoffroy St. Hilaire, that 
the male bird performed the duties of incubation.

The oldest mid lieat known species — The respects in wliich it differs from 
6'. aiutra[U — lU trae country until recently unknown— Vieillot's 
account of ita habits — Mr. Wallace's experiences in Cerani. 

This, the oldest and best known of all the cass#waries, 
was described more than a century ago by Linnseus 
under the name Struthio casuarius, and was the only 
species of the genus (as now restricted) known to him. 
Although lie seems to have confounded it to some 
extent with the emu {DromcBua novcB-hoUandicB) , apply- 
ing to it that name as a synonym, hia mention of the 
bare head {caput nudiusculurn), the helmet (galea), and 
the two neck-wattles (palearia membranacea 2), taken 
in connection witli tlie other characters which he assigned 
to it, sufficiently indicate the present species. 

The particular respects in which it differs from the 
Australian cassowary have been already alluded to,' 
and of these, the most striking perhaps, to a casual

fore-neck. Although it has frequently been stated that 
this bird is a native of Java, Sumatra, Banda, and the 
Moluccas generally, no confirmatory evidence of this is 
forthcoming, and the only locality that can with certainty 
lie assigned to it is the Island of Ceram. Specimens pro-

mony on this point is conclusive. In the highly in-

pelago,' he says : " Another large and extraordinary bird 




is the cassowary, which inhabits the Island of Ceram 
only.' It is a stout and strong bird, standing five or

six feet tigh, and covered with long, coarse, black, hair- 
like feathers. The head is ornamented with a large 
horny casque or helmet, and the bare skin of the neck 
13 conspicuons with bright blue and red colours. The 
wingB are quite absent, and are replaced by a group of 
horny black spines, like blunt porcupine quills." 

An American naturalist, Dr. J. B. Steere, who in 1875 
made a tour of the Island of Celebes, haa recently in- 
formed us that he failed to discover any trace of a casso- 
wary there. On one occasion, in the streets of Macassar, 
he saw a specimen of C. galeatus, but this he ascertained 
had been brought from Ceram. 

Although the existence of this bird has been so long 
known, little haa been ascertained of its habits. This, 
no doubt, must be attributed to the remoteness of its 
liaunts, its very restricted range, and the difficulty in 
obtaining reliable information concerning it. Vieillot, 
who published an account of it in the "Dictionaire 
d'Hiatoire Naturelle" (vol. v. p. 345), refers particularly 
to the hair-like feathers with which it is covered, and 
which, combined with the absence of a tail, cause it, 
when viewed at a little distance, to look more like a 
beast than a bird.^ It combines, he says, the stomach of 
a graminivorous animal with the intestines of a car- 
nivorous one. It subsists on fruits and roots of plants, 
its diet being purely vegetable. Signor D'Albertis 



■could hnrdly have failed to meet witt eo large a bird as the casaowary, had 
it existed, aa alleged, on other islands besides Ceram.

out (p. 3), the JCatitm differ from all other birde, and reaemhle the mam-

counted forty-three almost undigeBted seeds of t!ie fruit 
of a Pandanus in the excreta of a cassowary in New 
Guinea.' It runs swiftly, but being more clumay and 
heavy than an ostrich, its gait is by no means graceful. 
In temper it is fierce and spiteful, and uses both bill 
and feet dangerously in striking. 

In many important points of internal structure the 
cassowary differa materially from the ostrich. It is, in 
fact, not a desert bird at all, although fleet and powerful. 
Its digestive organs are not adapted for bard and coarse 
diet, but for fruits and tender succulent herbage. It 
wanders, says Mr. Wallace,* about the vast mountainous 
forests that cover the Island of Ceram, feeding chiefly on 
fallen fruits and on insects or Crustacea. The female 
lays from three to five large and beautifully sbagreened 
green eggs upon a bed of leaves, the male and female 
sitting upon them alternately for about a month. Cuvier 
has stated, but apparently only from supposition, that 
this bird abandons its eggs, like the ostrich, to be hatched 
by the heat of the sun — a statement which is not borne 
out either by the observations of modern travellers or 
the experience of directors of Zoological Gardens. 

In June 1866, and July 1867, a pair of G. galeatiis- 
bred in the gardens of the Zoological Society, and reared 
their young. This was believed to be the first instance 
that had occurred of the successful reproduction of this 
species in Europe.

CHAPTER VII. 



BECCARPS CASSOWARY— Casuarius beccarii, Sclater. 

Discovered by Dr, BeccJiri in the Aru lalands — Ita iliBtinEuishing charac- 
ters, aa pointed out by Mr. Sclater — A living example procured durinj; 
the voyage of the " Basilisk," and brought to Eiiglaiiil — Now living 
in the Gartlens of the Zoological Society, 

In introducing this species for the first time to the notice 
of naturalists at a meeting of the Zoological Society of 
Loudon in February 1875, Mr. Sclater exhibited coloured 
sketches of the bird, and also of its head and neck, taken 
from a stuffed specimen in the Museo Civico at Genoa, 
which had been procured by Dr. Beccari in Wokan, the 
most northern of the Aru Islands. From these it will 
be seen that this species is one of the two-wattled, or, 
more correctly speaking, double-wattled cassowaries, 
having a median throat-wattle, divided at its extremity 
into two small lobes. From the shape of the crest, which 
is considerably elevated, it appears to be most nearly 
allied to Casuarius austiulis, and has remarkably large 
and powerful legs. 

In naming it after its discoverer, Mr. Sclater thus 
described it — "Similis C. austraU et crista paii modo 
elevata : sed cainincula cciiicis una media, ad apicem 
divisa."^

comes nearest to C. australis. 

In June of the same year (1875) a cassowary, brought 




from New Zealand by Dr. Hector, was presented to the 
Zoological Society by the Eight Hon. Sir James Fer- 
gusson, Bart., late Governor of the colony, and was

identified by Mr. Sclater as belonging to the present 
species.* 

This bird was obtained in i873,"when quite young, 
nlong with another similar specimen, by the officers of 
H.M.S. "Basilisk," from tlie natives of Touan, or Com- 
wallis Island, in Torres Straits, four miles distant from 
the south coast of New Guinea, and seventy miles from 
the opposite coast of Cape York.^ The natives arc said 
to have captured the birds on the coast of New Guinea. 
The specimen in question was conveyed in the " Basilisk" 
to Wellington in July 1873, and remained there until 
shipped to London. When brought to Wellington, it was 
supposed to have been about nine months old. It is 
still living in the Zoological Society's Gai-dens. 

It is a large robust bird ; the forepart of the neck 
blue, with the neck wattle-bilobed, aa shown in the 
engraving, and flesh-coloured ; the back of the head 
verdigris-blue, and the back of the neck orange. The 
nail on the inner toe, which in all the cassowaries is 
very long and strong, and in C. picticollis especially is 
extraordiDardy developed, is in this species of moderate 
length, not exceeding two inches. This, however, must 
be regarded as a variable character. 

Mr, A. D. Bartlett informa us, that in confinement 
this long nail on the inner toe, although so strong, is 
often liable to fracture, and that an inch or more may be 
broken off, and will.grow again.

In the " Proceedings " of the Zoological Society for 1 860 
{p. 21 r), ilr. Selater directed attention to a young 
cassowary which he had recently obtained for the 
Society's Gardens by exchange with the Zoological 
Society of Rotterdam, "distinguishable from the com- 
niou cassowary by the throat caruncles being placed far 
apart on the sides of the thi'oat, lighter colom-iug, &c," 
The specimen in question being immature, and the casque 
not developed, it might well have passed for a bright- 
coloured variety of C galeatus, except for the complete 
separation of the neck-wattles, as shown by Jlr. Selater 
in the woodcut illustrating his remarks.^ Unfortunately, 
the bird died before arriving at maturity, as did also a 
second example, in the immature brown plumage, ob- 
tained from the same source in 1869.^ 

In 1872, however, a fine adult specimen of this 
species, procured in Calcutta, was transmitted to cm: 
Society, and fully established the validity of the species, 
as indicated by Mr. Selater, not only by reason of the

Some further notes on the species by Professor Schlegel 
will be found in his " Observations Zoologiquea " (Nederl.

specimens of this cassowary in the Leyden Museumj 
which were obtained in the Aru Islands.

CHAPTER IX. 

THE ONE-WATl'LED CASSOWARY— 
Camarius uniappmdiculatus, BlYti^ 

Described by the late Mr. Blyth from a living specimen ia an aviary at 
Calcutta — Its habitat theu unknown — Additional speciniens obtained, 
and thti species found to inhabit tbe Island of Salwatti and opposite 
coast of New Guinea — Confounded with C. jiojjtttiniti of Eoaenberg and 
othei species — An attempt to clear up the confusion. 

This species waa first described by the late Mr. Blyth/ 
who bestowed on it the specific name of uniappendi- 
culatics from its peculiarity of having but a single 
pendulous caruncle in front of the neck. 

The specimen which he described was in the aviary 
of the Bdbu Rajendra Mullik of Calcutta, and was 
apparently more than half grown, and much paler in 
the colouring of its plumage than two specimens of the 
same age of the common C. galeatua which were con- 
fined in the same paddock with it. In lieu of the two 
bright red caruncles of the latter, the present species 
has but a single small oblong or elongate oval yellow 
caruncle, and the bright colours of the naked portion 
of the neck are differently disposed. 

The cheeks and throat are smalt-blue, below which is

a large wrinkled apace of saffron yellow in front of the 
neck, terminating in front in the oval button-like carunclej 
and ita lower portion being continued round behind, 
while on the sides of the neck the yellow naked portion 
is continued down to its base, the bordering feathers 
more or less covering and concealing this lateral stripe 
of unfeathered skin ; on the hind part of the neck the 
bare yellow skin is not tumoua and corrugated as in 
the common cassowary, in which species, moreover, this 
part is bright red. The plumage is conspicuously brown, 
and not black. 

The casque is about equally developed at this age in 
the two species. The legs of uniappendicuJaius are 
smaller, however, from which it may be doubted whether 
it ever attains so large a size as the otlter. 

In August 1 860, Dr. George Bennett, while on a visit 
to Amsterdam, noticed a cassowary in the Zoological 
Gardens there, which struck him as corresponding very 
nearly with the species then recently described by Mr. 
Blyth. Subsequent investigation proved his surmise to 
be correct, and he communicated the fact to the ornitho- 
logical world in a letter to the ' ' Ibis " for 1 860 (p. 402}, 
accompanying his remarks with a coloured drawing (pi. 
xiv.) of the head and neck of the bird then living at 
Amsterdam. The history of this specimen, so far as he 
could ascertain it, was to the effect that it was brought 
home by the ship " Agatha and Maria" from the 
Moluccas, but no particular island was named. 

The locality whence Mr. Blyth's specimen came was 
also unknown to him, but in the "Journal fiir Oniitho- 
logie" for 1861 (p. 44, pi. i bis), Herr von Rosenberg 
described aa new a cassowary which has since been 
shown to be a young bird of the same species aa that 



114 THE ONE-WATTLED CASSOWARY. 

described by Mr. Blyth, and which came from the Island 
of Salwatti near New Guinea.' To this bird Von Rosen- 
berg gave the name of Casuarius kaupi, in honour of a 
distinguished German ornithologiat since deceased.^ 

A few years later, namely, in 1 866, Professor Schlegel 
communicated the fact ^ that the Museum at Leyden had 
then received seven specimens of a cassowary obtained 
by the well-known traveller Bernstein in the Island of 
Salwatti and on the opposite coast of New Guinea, in 
the same locality where Von Rosenberg had found his 
specimen of C kaupi. The species had proved to be C. 
uniappeiidiculatus, Bljrth, and identical with the living 
example in the Amsterdam Gardens, the single caruncle 
not being developed in the younger bird. In this view 
Mr. Gould concurred when figuring C uniappendiculatus 
in the Supplement to his " Birds of Australia." 

In September 1871, however, the Zoological Society 
of London obtained by exchange with the Zoological 
Society of Amsterdam a young cassowary, said to have 
been captured in the summer of 1 869 by a missionary 
on the north coast of New Guinea, which appeared to 
Mr. Sclater to be " identical with the bird described by 
Rosenberg as Casuarius kaujn." 

" Dr. Schlegel," says Mr. Sclater,^ " has referred this 
species to the young of C. uniappeiidictdattts ; but I can 



' See "Ibis," 1861, p. 312. This Epecimen is described as having no 
wattle. It must therefore have beeit an immatnre bird (cf. " Ibis," 1870, 
p. 120). Frommorerecent obserration Mr. Sclater is enahled to state ("Ibis," 
1874, p. 417) that " even ia its imniatuce brown plmnage, as shown by llie 
living example now in the Zoological Society's Qacdcns, this cassowaiy 
has a distinct median wattle."

hardly believe our bird to be the Bamo as the latter 
species, there being no traces at present of any throat- 
wattle at all, and the size being bo much smaller. Our 
bird seems to belong to a species closely allied to C 
heniietti, but quite distinct." 

The following year 1872, Mr, Sclater, referring to the 
apparent confusion which existed on the subject, directed 
attention ^ to the fact that Von Rosenberg described his 
specimen of C. kaitpi as an old male, and distinguished 




Caauanut kaupi, Solatbb. 



it &om C. galeatu^ by the entire absence of any throat- 
wattles. On this ground he thought that kaupi, Rosen- 
berg, could not possibly be referred to uniappendicu- 
latus, Blyth, as suggested by Professor Schlegel, espe- 
cially also as it was so much smaller in size than that 



THE ONE-WATTLED CASSOWARY. 



large species, and though very nearly adult, showing no 
traces whatever of a gular caruneln. 

After communicatiug with Dr. Kaup, in whose care 
at the Darmstadt Museum, was the original specimen 
of C haUjpi, he came to the conclusion that a second 
species of cassowary occurs in New Guinea, more nearly 
allied to C hennetti than to C. uniappendiculatus (the 
only species previously known to inhabit that country), 
and that the specific name kaupi ought to be retained 




for it. He has accordingly figured it under that name 
{1. c. pi. ix.) 

It seems, however, after all, that the bird from 
Northern New Guinea, which Mr. Sclater took to be 
kaupi, Rosenberg, is not that species but a different 
one ; apparently that to which Rosenberg had given the 
name papuanus?^

A third species from New Guinea, C. picticoUis, Sclater, 
has aiuce been discovered, of which we shall have to 
speak later. 

In August 1874, the Zoological Society received a 
young specimen of C. uniappendicidatus from Captain 
Moresby of H.M.S. " Basilisk," who obtained it from 
the Rajah of Salwatti.^ This specimen is figured in 
the "Proceedings" of the Society for 1875, pi. xx. fig. i. 
A larger and beautifully coloured figure of the species is 
given ljy Mr. Gould in the Supplement to his " Birds of 
Australia" {part v. pis. 74, 75), while a drawing of the 
head and neck, also coloured, will be found in the 
" Ibis " for i860, pi. xiv. 

The egg has been described by Mr. Sclater^ from 
three specimens laid in the Zoological Gardens at Am- 
sterdam. One of these, which we have seen, is in the 
possession of Mr. A. D. Bartlett, and is of the usual 
form and size of eggs of the genus Casuarius, but of a 
pale greenish white, thickly studded over with raised 
spots of a bright dark-green, which gives it a singular 
jewelled appearance. 



• Mr. Sclater finding that his G. kaupi was distinct from 0. wntappCTidi-

certain whether it was distinct from 0. papuanus, Bosenbei;g.

CHAPTER X. 

THE PAPUAN CASSO WAR Y— 
Casuarius papuanus^ Rosenberg. 

Inhabits Northern New Guinea — Little known concerning its habits — 
Described by Rosenberg — Confounded with the last named. 

The reader will have gathered from our remarks mider 
the head of the " One- Wattled Cassowary," C. uniappen- 
diculatits, that some little confusion has prevailed con- 
cerning that species and the present, owing, it appears, 
to the fact, that the young of uniappendiculatus has no 
throat- wattle, and hence for a time resembles appuanuSj 
which is destitute of this appendage at all ages. 

Little as yet is known of the Papuan cassowary. H. 
von Kosenberg described and named it ^ from two speci- 
mens procured in Northern New Guinea, and which are 
now preserved in the Ley den Museum. Dr Meyer con- 
siders it doubtfully distinct from C uniappendiculatus,^ 
We believe that Professor Schlegel at first identified them 
with Bennett's cassowary, but afterwards admitted their 
distinctness. 

The present species, as we have shown (p. 107), is 
the Casuarius kaupi of Sclater, although not the bird 
upon which Kosenberg bestowed the name kaupiyin honour 
of his distinguished countryman and fellow-naturalist.

WESTERMANN'S CASSO WAJi Y— 
Casuarius westermanni, Sclatf.r. 

A doubtful speciea — Little known concerning it — Mr. Sclater's deacription 
and Professor Schlegel'a remarks. 

It is with some hesitation that we give this bird a 
place as a distinct species, the more bo because Mr. 
Sclater, who bestowed the name above-mentioned, seems 
to have had some little doubt in the matter himself. 
He says/ " This species I established on a bird still 
living in the Zoological Gardens, which we received 
from Mr, Westermann in 1871. At first I referred this 
bird to C kaupi of Rosenberg, until that naturalist 
showed that the pretended species which he had so 
named was nothing more than the young of C. uniap- 
pendiculattis. I then changed our bird's name to C 
westermanni.'^ I have recently (October 1875) seen 
two other living specimens of this bird in the Zoo- 
logical Gardens at Rotterdam. It has been suggested 
that its true home is the island of Jobi in the 
Bay of Geelvink, where Dr. Meyer ascertained the 
existence of a cassowary, but was not able to procure 
specimens."

the Leyden Museum, he says (1. c), " Professor Schlegei 
at first identified them with the mooruk, C. hennetti^ 
but afterwards admitted their distinctness. My belief 
is that they are probably the same as C. westermanni, 
although the colours of the neck, as restored in the 
stuffed specimens, do not quite agree." 

If this be so, then Mr Sclater's name, westermanni, 
will sink into a synonym for papv/inus of Eosenberg, 
the latter name having precedence by a year. 

Owing to the variation which is found to exist in the 
shape and size of the casque, as well as in the size of the 
neck- wattle and the colour of the naked parts, all which 
differences are no doubt dependent upon age, sex, and 
season, it is extremely difficult to pronounce with cer- 
tainty upon the species of immature examples. We 
have yet much to learn respecting these very singular 
birds.

THE PAINTED-NECKED CASSOWARY— 
Casuarius picticoUis, Sclater. 

luliabiting New Guinea — Allied to the Moeruk — Particular respecta in 
which it differs from its allies. 

During the voyage of H.M.S. "Basilisk" in April 1873, 

the ofiBcera of that vessel, while at Discovery Bay on 
the south-east coast of New Guinea, procured a living 
cassowary not unlike the mooruk (C bennetti), hut dif- 
fering from it in having a brilliantly-coloured neck, the 
forepart red, the hinder part blue. On its arrival in 
this country, it was placed in the Zoological Society's 
Gardens in the Regent's Park, and the secretary remark- 
ing the peculiar respects in which it differed from the 
other species of cassowary known to him, described and 
figured it under the name above given in the "Proceed- 
ings " of the Society for 1875.^ 

Like Weatermanu's cassowary, it has no throat-wattle, 
but according to Mr. Sclater difiers from that bird in 
having the colours of the fore aud hinder parts of the 
neck reversed ; that is to say, in C. westermanni the fore 
part of the neck is blue, the hinder part red, while in 
the present species the reverse is the case. 

In the moorak (C. bennetti), the neck is entirely blue.

122 THE PAINTED-NECKED CASSOWARY. 

Whether C. westermanni be distinct from C. papuanus^ 
Kosenberg, or not, is at present not quite clear. In 
order, if possible, to settle the question, Mr. Sclater 
procured a coloured figure of the head and neck of the 
typical specimen of papuanus in the Leyden Museum, 
from which, as he says,^ *' it is quite evident that the 
two species are very nearly related." 

Dr. Meyer has suggested ^ that C westermanni is the 
cassowary of the Island of Jobi, and C papuanus that 
of the mainland of Northern New Guinea. (7. picticollis 
comes from the south of New Guinea. 

In May 1875, ^^- Bennett of Sydney forwarded a 
young cassowary which had been obtained alive from 
the natives in Milne Bay, New Guinea, by Mr. Godfrey 
Goodman, staff-surgeon on board H.M.S. "Basilisk," in 
1873. It had died on board, and its skin had been pre- 
served by Mr. Goodman. This bird, supposed to be the 
young of Casuariv^ ptcticollisy was still in the first 
down plumage, and was generally of a pale buffy brown 
with the head above rufescent. The back was dark, with 
one median and on each side two lateral broad stripes of 
pale brown. These stripes ran regularly parallel down 
the whole length of the back. The whole length of the 
skin from beak to tail was 10*5 inches, of the tarsus 2*9, 
and of the bill from gape 2*5.^ 

The specimen is now in the British Museum.

In the autumn of 1857, Captain Devlin of the cutter

whicli had been procured in New Britain in the South 
Pacific, where it appears to be known by the name of 
" Mooruk." It was at once secured by Dr. Bennett of 
Sydney, and the fact of its existence communicated by 
him to Mr. Gould, who described and figured it as a 
new species in the "Proceedings" of the Zoological 
Society for 1857 (p. 268, pi, 129), and named it after 
him, Casuarius hennetii. 

It has no throat-wattle, and may ije distinguished 
from the other species to which it is allied by the differ- 
ent colour of the throat and back of the neck. 

Dr. Bennett, in his " Gatherings of a Naturalist in 
Australia," i860, gives the following interesting account 
of this bird, accompanied by an excellent coloured figure 
of it by Wolf:— 

" It was procured from the natives of New Britain, an 
island in the South Pacific Ocean near to New Guinea, 
where it is known by the name of Mooruk. The height 
of the bird is three feet to the top of the back, and

five feet when standing erect ; its colour is rufous 
mixed ■with black on the back and hinder portions of the 
body, and raven-black about the neck and breast ; the 
loose wavy skin of the neck is beautifully coloured with 
iridescent tints of bluish-purple, pink, and an occasional 
shade of green — quite different from the red and purple 
caruncles of the Ca&uojriu& galeaius ; the feet and legs, 
which are very large and strong, are of a pale ash colour, 
and exhibit a remarkable peculiarity in the extreme 
length of the claw of the inner toe on each foot, it being 
nearly three times the length which it attains in the 
claws of the other toes. This bird also differs from the 
C galeatus in having a horny plate instead of a helmet- 
like protuberance on the top of the head, which callous 
plate resembles mother-of-pearl darkened with black- 
lead ; the form of the bill differs considerably from that 
of the emu, being narrower, longer, and more curved, 
and in having a black and leathery cere at the base, 
and behind the plate of the head is a small tuft of black 
hair-like feathers, which are continued in more or 
abundance over the greater part of the neck. The bird 
is very tame and familiar, and when in a good humour, 
frequently dances about its place of confinement. It 
is fed upon boiled potatoes, and meat occasionally, llie 
egg is about the same size as that of the emu, and 
is of a dirty pale yellowish colour. (1 give this descrip- 
tion from an egg obtained from the natives.) The bird 
appears to me to approximate nearer to the emu than 
to the cassowary, and to form the link between them, 
In its bearing and style of walking it resembles the 
former, throwing the head forward, and only becoming 
perfectly erect when running ; it also resembles the 
apteryx in the carriage of its body, its motion, and atti-

tudea. Its bill preaenta a good deal of the character of 
that of a rail; it utters a peculiar whistling, chirping 
sound, and 1 am informed it also emits a loud one, 
resembling the word Trbooruk, whence, no doubt, is 
derived its native name. The esiatenee of the species in 
New Britain or some of the neighbouring islands has 
been suspected for the last three years ; and some time 
since a young specimen was procured, but was un- 
fortunately lost overboard during the voyage. 

" I found the bird very familiar and tame in captivity. 
It was fed principally upon boiled potatoes, soaked 
bread, and occasionally a little meat. The eyes are of 
a dark brown colour. The legs are encircled at intervals 
with black bands. It is probably a male bird. It 
sometimes rolls about its cage like a dog, its huge legs 
being often uppermost. It sits on the rump, squatting 
down occasionally, and is exceedingly playful. A young 
specimen afterwards arrived in the same vessel, on the 
7th of February 1858, at Sydney. In this bird I 
observed a lighter tint of plumage, more furry or downy 
than in the adult bird, and the absence of the ii-idescent 
colours on the side of the neck and throat. The cheeks 
were also of a light fulvous-yellow colour, which may be 
either a distinctive mark of the young bird or a sexual 
difference. The plate on the head is flatter and less 
developed, and the legs and feet are of a paler ash colour 
than in the older bird. On the 26th of Februai-y 1858, 
I succeeded in purchasing the adult bird ; and on the 
evening of the same day {having a comfortable cage 
made for him), I shipped him safely on board the ship 
' British Merchant,' under the care of Dr. Plomley and 
Captain Duthie, for London, as a present to the Zoo- 
logical Society in the Kegent's Park. I was delighted to

find, by a notice in the Times, that tliia valuable bird 
had arrived ia England on the 24th of May, and was 
safely deposited in the Gardens, 

"I alao purchased an egg of thia bird and sent it to 
the Society. I was afterwards informed that two eggs 
arrived with the bird, one of which was purchased by 
the British Museum ; and the egg I sent to the Society 
haa also been presented to that institution. There is a 
marked difference between the two eggs : mine measures 
5i inches in length and 3J inches in diameter ; the other 
ia larger, and differs from it in general appearance. The 
colour of the egg of the mooruk is a pale greeniah-yellow, 
faintly creuulated with green ; the other is shorter, 
broader, and deeply crenulated with pea-green markings, 
closely resembling that of C. galeatus, I am of opinion, 
on examining all the eggs (four) in my possession, and 
those now in the British Museum (altogether sis), and 
comparing them with the egg of C. galeatus in Mr. Gould's 
collection, that Dr. Gray 'a conjecture^ respecting there 
being two species of cassowary in New Britain may yet 
be verified (that is, allowing my information to be 
correct, that all the eggs were brought from the same 
island), although we may sometimes find the colours of 
the eggs of the same bird to vary from exposure to the 
sun and other atmospheric influences. Dr. Gray says, 
" The egg of the mooruk is of the same form, and haa 
the same solid shell, covered with rounded tubercles, aa 
that of the common cassowary (C galeatus). It differs 
from the egg of the latter bird in the British Museum 
in being rather larger (it is 14^ inches in circumference 
in the longest, and 1 1^ inches in the thickest part), and 




in the tubercles on the surfaee being larger, considerably 
further apart, and more isolated, that is to say, more 
rarely confluent. The egg is pale olive-green, with 
darker oHve tubercles. It is much darker than the eggs 
of the cassowaries in other coUectious; but they may 
have become faded, as is the case with our specimens in 
the British Museum." 

Dr. Bennett sent with the living specimen of the 
mooruk an egg which was brought from New Britain 
with the bird. This egg has been presented by him, 
through the Society, to the British Museum. It differs 
very considerably from the other ; first, in being smaller, 
that is to say, only 13^ inches in circumference and 1 1 
inches in the thickest part ; secondly, in the egg being 
blunter, more rounded in front, and not so conical as 
the other ; thirdly, it is of a uniform pale oKve colour, 
without any appearance of tubercles or darker spots. It 
has been suggested that the difference between the two 
eggs is so great, that they cannot have been laid by the 
same species of bird. They differ considerably from the 
egg of C galeatus. They were both brought to Sydney 
with the living bii'd, so that if they are not the eggs of 
the mooruk, it would indicate that there must be two 
cassowaries inhabiting New Britain, both different from 
C galeatus. There is so great a similarity in the colour 
and texture of the smooth egg with the ground-colour 
of the other egg between the tubercles, that it has been 
suggested that the tuberculated egg is the perfect egg of 
the bird, and the smooth egg that of a very immature or 
sickly specimen.^ One egg, given to him by Mr. Thomas 
Dawson of Sydney, closely resembles the egg of the 

' Proc. ZooL Sot, 1858, pp. 271, 272, and fig. 



138 THE MOORUK. 

common cassowary ; it is very bright in colour, and 
has a yellowish-green ground, crenulated with vivid 
pea-green markinga. 

The mooruk was procured on that part of the coast 
of New Britain lying between Cape Palliser and Cape 
Stephens, at a native village under three hills, named 
by navigators " The Mother and Daughters," situated 
in St. George's Channel, between New Ireland and New 
Britain, opposite Amataka, or Duke of York's Island. , . . 

" The bird," says Dr Bennett, " was brought o£F by the 
natives to the vessel for sale. Captain Devlin informed 
me that they capture them when very young, soon after 
they are hatched, and rear them by band, but can rarely 
or never capture the adult, from its being so shy and 
difficult of approach. They are exceedingly swift of 
foot, and possessed of great strength in their legs. On 
the least alarm they elevate the head, and on seeing 
danger, dart among the thick bushes, thread localities 
where no human being can follow them, and disappear 
with incredible rapidity. The mooruk, with its powerful 
legs and muscular thighs, has an extraordinary power of 
leaping, and it was from this circumstance that the first 
specimen brought from New Britain was lost. One day 
when allowed to be at liberty, it made a spring on the 
deck, and went overboard ; as it was blowing a strong 
breeze at the time, the bird perished 

" Their wings aid them in running, but are never used 
for defence 

"The mooruk is a robust bird, and differs from the 
ostrich in its internal anatomy, its digestive organs being 
adapted only for a soft and nutritious diet — fruits, 
vegetables, insects, and eggs ; gi'ain, or any similar hard 
substance, not being digestible unless it has been previ- 



HA UNTS AND HABITS. 1 19 

ously boiled ; it aJso requires a quantity of small gravel 
or pebbles to aid in the trituration of its food, and often 
picks up nails and small bits of iron for a similar pur- 
pose 

I never heard them utter a sound like " Mooruk : " I 
am inclined to consider the name signifies in the native 
language, " swift," resembling closely the Malay terra 
"amuck," or mad career; and the extraordinary rapid 
movements of these birds, ■which I shall have occasion 
to relate further on, rather confirm my idea on this 
subject. .... 

The chirping sounds of the mooruk are very peculiar, 
being modulated according to the urgency of their wants 
and desii'es. Sometimes these notes are varied, as if 
speaking ; at one time they are mild, at another very 
vehement ; then rising to a higher and more rapid chirp, 
as if scolding ; afterwards becoming plaintive, as if be- 
seeching for something; again loud and rapid, as if 
impatient at delay. At a little distance this modulation 
of the chirping notes seems as if the birds were holding 
a conversation, and has a very singular effect 

The emu kicks outward and backward ; but these 
birds always kick in front, elongating the body at the 
same time 

The plumage varies in length, according to its situa- 
tion on the body; the longest feathers are about the 
rump and back, and the shortest about the neck ; de- 
scending to the back, they fall over the body, have more 
the rough appearance of hair than feathers, and readily 
throw off wet from the surface. Each shaft has two 
plumes growing out of it, and is covered with fiue down. 
The rudimentary wings are very small, and when they 
spread them out, look as if amputation had been per- 



I30 THE MOORUK. 

formed by a skilful surgeon ; the number of spines on 
each wing is four. The male has a bare red space on 
each side of the neck, extending slightly under the 
throat ; it imparts to the bird an appearance as if it had 
received an injury, and the feathers had been rubbed off; 
around the ears, and extending towards the upper part 
of the head, is a cere of a deep blue colour ; this blue 
mark exists also in the bird we call the female, but it 
has not the bare red space on each side of the neck. 
. . . . They are very clean birds, and their plum- 
age is always kept in fine shining condition ; they only 
enjoy a bath during the warm season of the year, as they 
seek refuge from rain during the colder months." 

Individuals of this species, as we learn from Mr. A. D. 
Bartlett, have bred in the Gardens of our Zoological 
Society. In June 1863, a single young one was hatched 
there, but did not live. The female began to lay in the 
middle of March, and deposited eggs at intervals of 
about eight days. The male bird commenced the duties 
of incubation on the 25 th March, when five eggs had 
been layed. One more was subsequently added. On 
the 1 7th June, after an incubation of fifty-two days, a 
single young one was hatched. It was very weak, how- 
ever, and only lived a few hours. Its portrait, beauti- 
fully drawn by Mr. Wolf, will be found in the " Pro- 
ceedings" of the Society for 1863, pi. 42. The follow- 
ing year in June, two young ones were hatched and 
reared.

The eoius, as before remarked, differ from the casso-

waxies ia indicated by the long, stiff, pointed shafts, 
generally five in number, black in colour, and of unequal 
length, which protrude through the plumage. 

" The entire plumage of the adult bird is of a light 
brown, mottled with dirty grey in some parts ; the head 
and neck are thinly covered witli short feathers, display- 
ing the purplish skin around the throat and ears. The 
young emus are very pretty, being of a greyish-white 
colour, with two stripes of black down the back, and two 
others on each side, each subdivided by a narrow middle 
line of white^ — these stripes being continued along the 
neck without subdivision, and broken into irregular 
spots on the head ; two other broken stripes pass down 
the fore part of the neck and breast, and terminate in a 
broad band across the thighs. There is but little variety 
of plumage in the two sexes. Irides brown ; the bill 
and legs dusky black. The bill is straight, very much 
depressed towards the sides, slightly keeled along the 
middle, and rounded at iU extremity ; nostrils large. 
Toes three, directed forwards. The feathers have more 
the appearance of hair than the usual plumage of birds, 
the barba being all loose and separate ; and a peculiarity 
in their structure is, that each feather appears to be 
double, from the elongation of the accessory plume. 
Mr. Yarrell observes, "The four genera of struthioua 
birds afford remarkable instances of the variety that 
occurs in this accessory plume, even in subjects so closely 
allied. In the ostrich, the feathers have no accessory 
plume. In the rhea, there is a tuft of down. In the 
emu, the accessory plume is augmented to the fuU size 
of the principal shaft and web, and the feather of this 
bird is constantly, and correctly, represented as having 
two plumes on one quill. In the cassowary, besides the 



■ TtCO SPECJES. 133 

double shafts and webs from a single quill, as in the 
emu, there is still an accessory plume, thus forming 
three distinct parts." 

In regard to its internal structure, the emu differs in 
certain details both from the cassowary and the ostrich ; 
and on this part of the subject the reader may be 
referred to Mr. W. K. Parker's remarks on the skull 
and other portions of the skeleton,' to Dr. Haughton's 
account of its muscular anatomy,'' and to the description 
of the tracheal pouch and heart, by Dr. Murie* and 
Mr. Coughtrey.* 

For a long time it was supposed that there was only 
one species of this genus, which is exclusively confined 
to Australia, and it was asserted by Sturt,'' that it 
ranged over the whole of the Australian continent, 
although he did not see any to the north of the Stony 
Desert. Those he saw in the distant interior, he says, 
did not differ from the common emu. 

In 1859, however, Mr. Bartlett, the able superinten- 
dent of the Zoological Society's Gardens, pointed out 
certain peculiarities in an adult and two immature speci- 
mens then recently received, which seemed to indicate 
that in Western Australia there was a second species of 
emu, smaller and in other respects distinct. Of this 
bird we shall have occasion to speak later. 

In size and bulk the common emu is exceeded by the

African ostrich alone. " Its average measurement," says 
Mr. Gould/ " may be estimated at between five and six 
feet in height. lu form it closely resembles the ostrich, 
but is lower on the legs, shorter in the neek, and of a 
more thick-set and clumsy make. At a distance its 
feathera have more the appearance of hair than of plum- 
age, their barbs being all loose and separate. As in the 
ostriches, they take their origin by pairs from the same 
shaft. The wings are so extremely small as to be quite 
Invisible when applied to the surface of the body. They 
are clothed with feathers exactly similar to those of the 
back, which divide from a middle line and fall grace- 
fully over on either side." 

" Its flesh has been compared to coarse beef, which 
it resembles, according to Mr. Cunningham, both in 
appearnnce and taste, and is good and sweet eating ; 
nothing indeed can be more delicate than the flesh of 
the young ones. There is but little fit for culinary use 
upon any part of the emu, except the hind quarters, 
which are of such dimensions, that the shouldering of 
two hind-legs homewards for a mile distance once 
proved to me as tiresome a task as I ever recollect to 
have encountered in the colony. I may remark, that 
its flesh proved of the greatest service to Dr. Leichhardt 
and his intrepid companions during their overland route 
from Moreton Bay to Port Essingtou, in the coui'se of 
which, but more particularly between the head of the 
Gulf of Carpentaria and Port Essiugton, the sight and 
capture of the emu was almost a daily occurrence ; so 
abundant in fact was it, that he states he saw in the 
short space of eight miles at least a hundred, in flocks

ITS GEOGRAPHICAL RANGE. 



of three, five, ten, and even more, at a time. Dr. Leich- 
hardt mentions that the natives, on killing an emu, 
invariably break the wings ; why, he was at a loss to 
conceive, as they could but slightly assist the animal in 
making its escape should it survive ; some curious prac- 
tices also exist with respect to this bird among the 
natives, the particulars of which I have not been able to 
learn, but I may mention that the young men and boys 
are not allowed to feed upon it. 

" On the continent of Australia, the emu was formerly 
abundant about Botany Bay and Port Jackson Harbour, 
but is now only to be seen on the plains of the interior, 
over whose soHtudes it still roams in great numbers, 
and where it breeds, depending upon the strength and 
swiftness of its legs to avoid the pursuit of the stock- 
men and their dogs. Further and further back, how- 
ever, will it be driven, until it be extirpated, unless 
some law be instituted to check its wanton destruction. 
That it might easily be preserved, is evident from the 
readiness with which it breeds in confinement ; and 
surely I have here said aufiicient to induce the Austra- 
lian authorities to give a thought to its protection, as 
well as that of the great red and grey kangaroos and 
other interesting native birds a,nd quadrupeds. 

" The note of the emu is a low bpoming or pumping 
noise, which we know is produced in the female by 
means of the expansion and contraction of a large mem- 
branous bag, surrounding an oblong opening through the 
rings of the trachea; but whether this peculiarity of struc- 
ture is also to be found in the male, I am not aware. 

" They pair with tolerable constancy, and the male 
bird appears to take a large share in the task of incu- 
bation. 



" The eggs, wliicb are merely placed in a cavity seoopetl 
in the earth, generally in a sandy soil, are aix or seven 
iu number, of a beautiful dark green, resembling sha- 
green in appearance ; 5 J inches iu length, by 3I inches 
in breadth. They are liel'l in much esteem by the natives, 
who feed upon them whenever they can be procured. 

" Little or no difference of colour ia observable iu the 
sexes; but I believe the female is always smaller than 
the male." 

Sturt states that a good many were killed by the dogs 
at Fort Grey. They travel many miles during a single 
night to water, as Viua proved by a pack of thirteen 
coming down to the Depot Creek that had been seen the 
evening before more than twelve miles to the north.^ 

"To see the emu in its wild state," says Dr. Bennett,' 
" the far interior of Australia must be visited ; and 
unless attention is paid to rearing them, the time ia not 
far distant when this noble bird will have met the fate 
of so many of the wingless birds, and become extinct. 
In visiting the interior of Australia in 1832, I travelled 
some hundreds of miles before even a solitary specimen 
was seen ; and then, instead of the flocks heard of in 
the early periods of the colony, consisting of a dozen or 
more, 1 only saw two or three at the utmost, and usually 
only a solitary bird. The part of the country I allude 
to is now well settled, and the emu ia seen there no 
more." " About the Murrambidgee and Tumat this bird 
is uamed by the blacks ' Gorin' and ' Berebine.' * It is

ITS VALUE W AUSTRALIA. 137 

principally valued by the stock-keepera for its oil, the 
akin of a full-grown bird producing six or seven quarts, 
which is clear, and of a bright yellow or golden colour. 
The method adopted for extracting or trying the oil Ja 
to pluck the feathers, cut the skin into pieces, and boil 
it. The oil is also valued for burning in lamps, pro- 
ducing no disagreeable smell. It is likewise considered 
a good embrocation for sprains and bruises of horses 
and cattle, either alone, or mixed with turpentine when 
stronger stimulating properties are required. The blacks 
eat the flesh with the skin upon it, regarding it as a 
highly luscious treat, as the Esquimaux luxuriate on the 
flesh of whales and seals." 

Leichhardt thus describes the method he adopted to 
extract the oil from the skin : — "We busied oui-selves 
in extracting the oil from the skin of the emu. This 
operation was performed by suspending it on sticks 
before a gentle fire, the oil dripping from it into a shal- 
low vessel. It is of a light amber colour, and is very 
useful in oihng the locks of our firearms. It has been 
considered a good auti-rheumatic, and I occasionally 
used it for that purpose." The fat accumulates in the 
emu about the rump and between the scapularies and the 
sternum, but is also diffused over the whole akin. It is 
of a ligbt-yeUowish colour, ta.steless, and free from smell 
when in a recent state. Leichhardt says: "Several 
times, when sufiering from excessive fatigue, I rubbed it 
iuto the skin all over the body, and its slightly exciting 
properties proved very beneficial." 

"The emu," observes Dr. Bennett, "crops herbage 
like the cow or horse, and feeds upon various fruits ; it 
possesses great keenness of vision. The flesh is eaten by 
the settlers, and by some is preferred to the kangaroo ; 



138 THE EMU. 

the rump part is considered as delicate as fowl ; the legs 
coarse, like beef, but tender when the animal is young. 
The fibulffi of the legs are used as ornaments by the 
blacks. The best time to hunt these birds ia at an early- 
hour in the morning, when they are seen cropping the 
tender grasses. They are swift of foot ; but as soon as 
the dogs reach them, which ia not until they are com- 
pletely tired out, they are speedily overthrown and 
killed." 

" The Earl of Derby found the emu to be strictly 
monogamous, not approaching any female but the 
favoured one. The formation of their nest is very 
simple ; they usually select a situation in a scrub upon 
the hills, where they scrape a space similar to those made 
by brooding hens ; sticks and leaves are left about and 
upon the cleared place ; in this the eggs are deposited 
without regard to regularity, the number varying from 
nine to thirteen ; and it ia a curious circumstance that 
it is always an odd number, some nests having been 
discovered with nine, others with eleven, and others 
again with thirteen eggs. It is now ascertained beyond 
doubt that the eggs are hatched by incubation ; they are 
of large size, some measuring about six inches in length, 
with a diameter of three and a half inches, but some are 
smaller than others ; they vary in colour, from a beauti- 
. ful bluish-green to a dark bottle-green colour. 

"The emu is found on the plains and open forest 
country; the kangaroo on the hilly ranges. Many of 
the Australian fruits are eaten by the emu, more espe- 
cially the quandong or native peach {Fn^anus acwmi- 
natiis), which, when in season, ^s its favourite food. 

" The kick of the emu is its only means of defence, and 
it has proved so formidable as to disable dogs that have 



JTS FORMER ABUNDANCE. 139 

attacked it ; the blow is given backward and outward, 
in a manner similar to that in which a cow kicks. 

" At Sydney some very elegant and useful ornaments 
have been made of tlie eggs, mounted in silver, as milk- 
jugs, augar-basins, &c. ; but I find that the egg, exposed 
to the glare of the sun, soon loses its beautiful green 
colour, and becomes of a brownish hue." 

In Collina's "Account of New South Wales " we find 
that emus were formerly very numerous at Rose Hill, 
near Paramatta; they were seen in flocks of twelve. 
Two emus wandered into their camp, and were so inter- 
mingled with the people, who ran out of their tents at 
such a novel sight, that it was dangerous to fire at them, 
and they got clear off, though literally surrounded by 
men, and under the muzzles of some of their muskets. 

" The emu," continues Dr. Bennett, " being a vegetable 
feeder, care is required to prevent the tame birds from 
entering a garden, as they prove very destructive to the 
fruit. Emus, whether tame or in their wild state, evince 
great curiosity at the approach of any object with which 
they were not previously acquainted. I once saw a fine 
pair of full-grown specimens in a paddock near Sydney. 
Stopping to observe one which was at a short distance 
from the fence, he immediately came down to have a look 
at me. The second bird was some distance off, but, with 
their usual keenness of vision, on perceiving me viewing 
his companion, he came stalking down rapidly, and they 
both stared at me most attentively, stretching out their 
necks for the sake of making a nearer acquaintance ; 
when, finding no result from our interview, and their 
curiosity being satisfied, they quietly stalked away. In 
the Domain, near the Government House, some tame emus 
may be seen walking about, and often, near the Guard- 



houBe, marching with measured pace, as if keeping guard 
with the aoldiers on duty. One day, during the levee, 
when the Domain was crowded with people to see the 
arrivals and listen to the band, the emus mingled with 
the crowd, apparently enjoying the gay acene around 
them, when some strangers, who were afraid of these 
hirds, ran away. On seeing this, the emus (enjoying a 
chase) pursued, and overtaking one of the gentlemen, 
took off his hat, to his great surprise. The above cir- 
cumstance demonstrates their fearless nature, and how 
readily these noble birds might be domesticated. 

" The only sound emitted by the emu is a sort of 
hollow booming note. It is considered to be produced, 
in the female, by means of the expansion and contrac- 
tion of a large membranous bag surrounding an oblong 
opening through the rings of the trachea. 

Although emus are so scarce that a traveller may 
joui'ney hundreds of mUes in the interior of Australia 
without seeing one, yet, in an unfrequented part of the 
country not fifty miles distant from Sydney, where they 
have been left undisturbed, between twenty and thirty 
of these birds were observed together a short time ago, 
showing that, if left unmolested, they rapidly increase. 

Dr. Bennett tella us that dogs accustomed to hunt the 
emu invariably seize it by the neck, and dragging it 
down, kill it ; but such as are not in the habit of hunt- 
ing this bird seize it by the leg, from which they receive 
a kick that often injures them severely. Major Mitchell, 
writing on the cbaae of the emu, says' : " It is one thing 
for a swift dog to overtake an emu, and another to kill 
or even to seize it. Our dogs are only now learning to 



" Three Eipcdilions into the Interior of Eastern Auatralia," 1839. 



A 



DO ME STIC A TJON. 1 4 1 

seize emus, although they had chased and overtaken 
many. To attempt to seize them by the side or leg is 
dangerous, as an emu could break a log with a kick ; 
but if they seize them by the neck, as good dogs learn 
to do, the bird is immediately overthrown, and easily 
killed. The flesh resembles a beefsteak, and has a very 
agreeable flavour, being far preferable to that of the 
kangaroo." 

From its hardy nature and herbivorous habits the 
emu is readily domesticated, and many successful ex- 
periments have already been made in this country with 
a view to acclimatise the bird here. Amongst other 
successful breeders of emus was the late Duke of New- 
castle, who had several of these birds at large in the 
beautiful grounds of Clumber. Mr. W. B. Tegetmeier, 
who some years since paid a visit to Clumber for the 
purpose of inspecting the aviaries there, and was espe- 
cially interested with the young emus, has been good 
enough to furnish us with the following extracts from an 
account which he published at the time in the natural 
history columns of "The Field." He says: — 

" I am strongly inclined to think that the emu might 
be a profitable addition to our somewhat meagre list of 
domesticated animals capable of yielding food for the 
use of man. The birds are perfectly hardy, refusing the 
shelter of a shed during the severest weather ; exclu- 
sively herbivorous — not even, like turkeys or ordinary 
poultry, requiring grain, which if given unground passes 
through the body without cliange. 

" The chief food of the adult bird is grass. Those at 
Clumber graze with the cows and horses in an open

field, and are fond of cabbage, lettuce, or any garden 
refuse. During the laying season they are also supplied 
with a proportion of meal mixed with water, or soaked 
ehip-biscuits. For their size and weight they are un- 
questionably small eaters. They are readily kept within 
bounds by ordinary fences, never attempting to force 
through a hedge or pass over a gate. They are also 
very prolific, the hen layiug nearly thirty eggs every 
season. It is true that these are more than the male bird 
can cover ; but there appears to be no valid reason why a 
portion of the eggs should not be hatched under turkeys 
without the slightest difficulty. When to these recom- 
mendations we add their strangely picturesque appear- 
ance as seen walking at a short distance, I can conceive 
no more useful or attractive addition to the fauna of an 
enclosed park. 

"The pair of birds at Clumber were then four years 
old ; the female laid for the fii'st time early in the year 
1867. During the year 1868, of which only I have any 
accurate record, she commenced to lay on January 5, 
and laid every second or third day until she had depo- 
sited twenty-seven eggs, which were placed on the floor 
of a shed, which opens into the small enclosure in which 
the birds were confined at that time. After seven eggs 
had been deposited the male proceeded to sit upon them, 
and sat steadily for eight days, when the female dis- 
turbed liim, and he left the nest for eight days— the 
eggs being exposed during the whole of this time to the 
severe weather of February. At the end of this period 
the cock resumed his task of incubation, and sat for 
sixty-two days after the commencement of the s 
incubation. At this time Mr, Douglas thought that the 
health of the bird would suffer from the long-continued 




HABITS IN CONFINEMENT. 143 

coufinement and abstinence from food, as lie refused to 
eat anytliing whilst on the neat, although food and water 
were placed within his reach, ancl he only came off the 
eggs three times during the long period of incubation. 

As the date at which the eggs should have hatched, 
counting from the first commencement of incubation, 
had passed, it was feared that they were not fertile ; but 
on placing them in wann water their active motion soon 
testified to the existence of living emus within. They 
were consequently returned to the neat and hatched in 
due course. Of the seven eggs, one was rotten, two 
young emu chicks died in the shell, and four were 
hatched, one of which was accidentally killed by the 
male. 

" Of the remaining eggs, several were eaten, and found 
of unquestionable excellence. They weigh about one 
pound and a quarter each. 

" The young at birth are most interesting-looking 
creatures. In colour they do not resemble the mixture 
of dull brown and grey that characterises the loose 
plumage of the old birds, but are striped longitudinally 
on the sides like a zebra, the markings being dark on a 
light ground. Fearful of any injury that might arise 
from the parents, the young emus were reared by band, 
being for a few days crammed with chopped lettuce, rib 
grass, clover, leaves, and custard. Before the end of the 
first week they had learned to feed themselves, and their 
chief food now consists of grass, rib-grass [Plantago 
laiiceolata), cabbage, clover, with some bread and meal. 
Their mode of drinking is peculiar. They spoon the 
water up with the lower mandible, and allow it to run 
to the back of the mouth. They are now about four feet 
high, and weigh about i61bs. to iSlba. each. They arg

so tame that tliey became a trouble when at large, 
as they coiild not be kept out of the houae ; and now 
they run towards any one approaching the enclosure, 
uttering a soliciting note of "peep, peep," very unlike 
the piiraping sound uttered by the adult female. 

" Their gambols and play are strangely peculiar. The 
wings are so very rudimentary that tlie action is en- 
tirely confined to the neck and legs. They leap, they 
kick out with one leg, roll on their sides and backs, 
kicking with both legs ; again they leap up, and chaae 
each other in the most good-humoured frolic." 

The remarks already made with regard to the domes- 
tication of the South American rhea for the purpose of 
food (p. 84), apply equally well to the present species. 
No species of the ostrich family is more readily domes- 
ticated. 

In the Zoological Society's Gardens, these birds have 
several times reared their young. In France several 
successful experiments have been made to acclimatise 
them, and the advantages to be derived from the domes- 
tication of this species have been pointed out by M. 
Touchard, in a very interesting article in which he has 
given the results of his own experiments.' 

In the royal park at Buen-Iietiro, near Madrid, as we 
learn from Senor Graells, the emu has thriven well and 
reared its young,* and a like success has attended similar 
experiments at Vienna.'

THE SPOTTED EMU—Dromaus irrcratus, Bartlett. 



How Uiatingujshed from the common epeoieB — Inhabits Western Australia 
Dr. Bennett's account of it — Easily domesticated — lis Buccessful actli- 
iiiatimtion in England by Mr. W. Bennett 

Although it was for a long time supposed that only 
one species of emu existed in Australia, there seems to 
be now good reason for believing that in the western por- 
tion of that continent a second species is found, which 
is smaller and somewhat differently coloured. 

At a meeting of the Zoological Society in May 1859, 
Mr. Bartlett, superintendent of the Society's Gardens, 
exhibited an emu then recently received with two others 
from the interior of South Australia, upon which he 
made the following remarks : — 

" It differs from Dromceus novm-hollandia in having 
the whole of the feathers of the body distinctly marked 
with narrow transverse bars of light-grey and dark 
browniah-blaek. The feathers of the back and sides are 
broader, longer, and less silky in texture than those of 
the common species, the latter difference being quite 
evident to the touch ; the upper part of the head and 
neck is nearly black, and the feathers appear thicker 
than those of the same parts in the other bird. 

" The specimen to which tliese remarks refer was one 
of three examined by me, two of which were adult and 




146 THE SPOTTED EMU. 

one a young bird about one-third grown. The latter 
exhibited the transverse bars on its plumage as dis- 
tinctly as the adult bird, and the broad longitudinal 
stripes were clearly to be seen. Judging from the skins 
I have seen, I am inclined to consider that this new bird 
is smaller than the common species. I beg to propose, 
provisionally, the name of ^ Dromceus irroratus' for 
this supposed new species." 

Mr. Gould having seen adult and young examples of 
this emu, all bearing the characters which suggested its 
specific name, has no doubt of its being distinct from 
DromcBUS novce-hollandicB. He is almost equally certain 
that it is confined to the western division of Australia, 
and that it represents there the emu of the eastern. 
Whether the two species inosculate in South Australia, 
and whether the present bird extends its range to the 
north and north-western coast or not, future research 
must determine. 

In the " Proceedings " of the Zoological Society for 
i860, p. 247, Mr. Sclater, referring to DromceiLS irrordtus, 
says, " I have lately had the pleasure of examining two 
specimens in Holland. One of these, now in the gardens 
of the Zoological Society of Amsterdam, was brought 
from Albany in Western Australia, and thus renders 
it probable that the spotted emu is the western repre- 
sentative of Dromceits novce-hollandicB. The second, 
now in the Zoological Gardens at Kotterdam, I have 
obtained by exchange for this Society. The emu of 
Western Australia (as was pointed out by Mr. Bartlett 
when he first described it) may be easily distinguished 
from the well-known eastern bird by its spotted 
plumage. On comparing the feathers of the two 
species together, the mode in which this spotting is pro- 



/TS DISTINGUISHING CHARACTERS. 147 

duced is clearly apparent. The feathers of D. irroratiis 
are barred alteroately with silky white and darkish grey 
throughout their length, terminating in a black tip 
mai^ined posteriorly with rufoua. Those of D. novcB- 
hollandicE are uniform blackish grey fi-om the base to 
the extremity, which is black, with a black terminal 
band of rufous. On compariug the two living birds, 
we find D. irroratus generally of a much more slender 
habit. The tai-si are longer and thinner, the toes longer 
and much more slender, and the tai'sal scutes smaller. 
The irides ai'e pale hazel, ioatead of reddish brown, as 
in D. novcB-hollandiw. As Mr. Bartlett's original skin 
of Z>, irroratus was obtained in the interior of Southern 
Australia, the range of this emu may be supposed to 
extend over the western portion of Australia into 
the latter colony, where it probably inosculates with 
D. nov(S-hollandicB. Two additional specimens of 
the spotted emu (both immature) have been lately 
received by the Society from Swan Kiver. In this 
state of plumage the )jird is decidedly darker than 
its near ally," 

The spotted emu appears to be as hardy a bird and 
as readily acclimatised in this country as its congener. 
Ml'. William Bennett of Betchworth, Surrey, has been 
particularly successful in breeding and rearing this 
species, and to show how easily this may be achieved by 
others who may have similar opportunities, we cannot 
do better than quote the extremely interesting account 
which he baa given of the experiments made by him. 
He says' — 

"On the 23d of June i860, by favour of the late

148 THE SPOTTED EMU. 

Captain Neatliy, of the * Duncan Dunbar/ I received a 
pair of emus, just imported by him from Sydney. 
They were somewhat unmanageable when first landed ; 
and proving too large, and requiring too much room for 
the person at Sydenham for whom they were originally 
intended, they were kindly taken in for a short time by 
the authorities of the Crystal Palace, from whence they 
were removed here direct. 

" The first thing was to provide the best conditions I 
could to make them comfortable. For this purpose a 
space or paddock of about a quarter of an acre, well 
shaded on one side, with a southern slope towards the 
Eiver Mole, was enclosed by iron hurdles, with the 
house in which they were imported placed in one corner 
for night shelter. They were protected from the river, 
because, though fond of water, they do not know how 
to manage themselves out of their depth, the bottom in 
this part being very uncertain and full of great holes. 
As soon as their propensity for bathing was discovered, a 
pond of a graduated depth was made for the purpose, in 
which they disport themselves precisely in the manner 
of a fowl in a dust-bath. They were driven into the 
house the first two or three nights ; but exhibiting an 
invincible repugnance to this process from the moment 
they obtained their freedom, and not appearing to suffer, 
they were ever after left to their liberty in this respect ; 
and though it was resumed in the winter, they never 
voluntarily sought shelter in any weather beyond that 
of the trees, but generally settled in the dampest spot 
they could find for the night. They did not appear at 
all to suffer even from being out in the snow, and I 
have seen them eat pieces of solid ice thrown out of the 
water-bucket, though their acquaintance with either of

these phenomena, I apprehend, must be very rare in 
their native country. 

" From the moment the birds came into my posses- 
sion, I put myself in communication with the Zoological 
Gardens, Regent's Park, in order to learn what I could 
of their habits, food, and treatment. The staple food is 
dog-biscuit, broken up into moderately small pieces, as 
the emu has no means of mastication or fracturing, 
varied with bread, boiled rice, Indian-corn occasionally, 
witli a large proportion of chopped-up vegetables, such 
as lettuce and cabbage, greatly preferring the former, or, 
in its deficiency, any other succulent milky sort will 
do, as dandelion, sow-thistle, &c. They are also very 
fond of fruit of any kind, in any condition of maturity, 
from the smallest apples that begin to fall, green goose- 
berries, unripe or ripe strawberries or raspberries, up to 
grapes or even wall-fruit, so that it is not decayed, about 
which they are very particular. The apple-parings are 
all saved for them in winter time. They feed like- 
wise considerably on grass, some kinds of leaves, and 
will pick up green acorns ; so that their bill of fare 
offers no anxiety. The young birds are fed ou meal, 
mixed with hard-boiled egg and vegetables chopped 
fine, together made into a ball with water or milk, dry 
enough to crumble. Besides their adult stock they had 
at that time one young one in the gardens, hatched by 
means of an incubator and nursed by a great cochin hen. 
It was amusing to see the tall loug-legged bantling trying 
to nestle to its strange foster-mother. The poor little 
thing lived to about four months and then died of 
diphtheria. The young emus are full-fledged and sti'iped 
longitudinally, and nestle with their heads only beneath 
the parent bird. 



150 THE SPOTTED EMU, 

" From the infonnation of the captain, my bircjs were 
either in their fifth or sixth year at the time of their 
arrival, and of course at full maturity. They appeared 
to prosper well, and improved in feather considerably.. 
They became also much more gentle in manner, and at 
times very playful, with the most grotesque attitudes in 
the way of dancing, sometimes performing a regular 
pirouette, with their tall figures and feathers acting as 
crinoline. 

" The severity of the winter was passing, when one 
morning, the 9th of February 1861, on a heap of litter 
just outside the emu-house, and slightly concealed by 
the straw being drawn over, was discovered an egg. 
When first brought to me, having no idea there was any 
egg of that colour and character, I thought it the most 
wonderful natural production I had ever seen. It 
was very heavy, of a perfectly symmetrical form, dark 
green in colour, slightly fretted or shagreened, and 
looking more like a mass of polished malachite than 
any organised product. The beauty of the shell was 
displayed in the late International Exhibition, where the 
emu's ^gg might be seen made up into ornamental 
drinking- cups, mounted in silver, of a variety of patterns, 
in the Australian department. 

"I communicated directly with the Zoological Gardens, 
and was duly informed that the egg was a perfectly 
normal one, that I might expect a batch of from ten to 
fourteen, at intervals of about three days each, and that 
in due course, if things went on favourably, the male bird 
would collect the eggs together in a rude sort of nest, 
would sit indefatigably for the long period of eight 
weeks, and would wholly take the charge of, tend, and 
bring up the young ones when hatched. 



DOMESTICA TION IN ENGLAND. 15 1 

" My second egg was not laid till the ninth day, and 
then I was presented with one every third day regularly, 
up to the thirteenth egg, which took four days in making 
its appeai'anee, and was the largest and heaviest of the 
batch, weighing lib. 5^oz. They had steadily increased 
in size and weight from the first. After the deposit of 
tlie second outside the house, being still cold weather, 
and anxious to secure their vitality, I replaced each egg 
by imitation ones I had made and painted, and succeeded 
in inducing the process to take place while the birds 
were within the house at night. As the number in- 
creased, the two fii-st real eggs were put back, in order 
to run as little risk as possible of dissatisfying the 
bird, and subsequently they were left as laid. They all 
underwent the process of aiTangement and reairange- 
ment Avith eveiy addition. One morning I found one of 
the Ijirds busily engaged in shifting the eggs in the 
usual manner with its beak, and suspicion of its inten- 
tions being excited, I watched it tiU it succeeded iu 
rolling one out of the house. I replaced it. The same 
thing was repeated the following morning. As there 
Was a fall of snow of several inches, ' This won't do,' 
says I to myself, for fear of breakage, and I set my 
thoughts to work to interpret the meaning. I came to 
the conclusion that it was a certain indication the bird 
would not sit in that house, but was in search of some 
other place. By observing narrowly I noticed a parti- 
ality to one particular and moderately sheltered corner 
of the open ground, not very far off. I immediately 
had four poles erected, and an awning put over a suffi- 
cient space ; under this was scooped out a slight hollow, a 
layer of sand placed therein, with a covering of dry 
litter, aud the nest-eggs removed thereto. To my great 



THE SPOTTED EhfU. 



satiafaction the next egg was laid there, and on the 24th 
of March i86i the bird finally sat dowu. 

Now comes the proper time for the question. Which 
bird really waa it ? The next day, as soon as I was 
satisfied the bird waa fairly settled, I hastened up to the 
Zoological Gardens and informed the authorities of my 
success so far, and that their information was correct in 
every particular, except that my female bird was the 
one that, secundem artem, had taken to the nest — at 
least, the one the captain who imported them said, and I 
had always taken to be, the female emu. With this 
the keeper seemed very much surprised and dissatisfied, 
and began to question whether I really had the sexes. 
Upon his croas-esamining me as to the marks and signs, 
especially as to the voices of the two birds — upon the 
evidence of which I had greatly relied as determining 
the one with the deep and distinct call being the male 
bird — ^he assured me I was mistaken; that that bird 
which was still at large with mo was the female, and 
that consequently it was the male bird that had normally 
aat down. I was still, I confess, incredulous. 

"It is proper here to observe that in the emu, as ia 
several other Australian species, there is no characteristic 
male plumage, or rather the little difference there is, and 
various other usual outward signs, is reversed. Of my 
pair, one is considerably larger than the other, stouter 
in hmb, and more robust in every feature ; it has a 
alight top-knot, and goes strutting about, especially in 
damp weather, with its breast-feathers fuUy out, like a 
pouter pigeon, or rather some huge turkey-cock. It is 
usually the more courageous and pugilistic. It makes 
a deep, hollow, guttural boom when under any gentle 
excitement of pride or pleasure, especially on damp 



DOMESTICATION IN ENGLAND. 



evenings, or in the still hours of the night, sounding like 
a small gong or distant muffled drum. The other ia 
more agile and graceful in all its movements, corre- 
sponding with its slenderer frame, more docile and 
inquisitive, fleeter of foot, and with no voice beyond a 
suppressed hiss when angry, and a sort of grunt when 
distressed. The former is the one we took to be the 
male, the latter the female, and all our visitors, farmers 
and other natural judges, who had the opportunity of 
observing their manners, agreed in the opinion. It was 
this last which took sole notice of the eggs (they were 
usually laid at night, when the birds were always 
together, so that it was not detected which actually laid 
them the first season), in the way of arranging and con- 
cealment, and that finally sat down upon them. 

" For the first month the bird sat most assiduously, not 
being observed to come off the nest for the necessary 
food and water oftener than twice in the week, and then 
for scarcely more than a minute at a time. Nine eggs 
was the number the birds had been set upon. Three 
were taken to the Zoological Gardens to be tried by an 
incubator. One or two got accidentally broken. The 
first good observation that was obtained of the nest 
when the bird was o£F, there were found to bo twelve 
eggs in it, so that three more had been laid in to the 
origiDal number. Which bii'd deposited these last? 
The total number of eggs was sixteen. 

" During the fifth week the bird became restless, and I 
began to be afraid would not hold out the long period. 
I thought it possible a change might be going to take 
place in the duties of incubation. But no relief was 
offered. The bird at large continued to walk about 
with the most stolid indifference. The one on the nest 




JS4 THE SPOTTED EMU. 

settled again, only coming off for refrealiment twice 
a day instead of twice a week. 

" Everything went ou prosperously till tlie seventh 
week had expired. My family were absent at our place 
of worship. On coming home, immediately on entering 
the premises and catching sight of the bird at large, with 
that instinctive perception we cannot always trace to 
any particular cause, I saw that something was wrong. 
I hastened to tlie nest, and found it deserted 1 The 
bird that ought to have been there was wandering about 
in a state of iri'itation and excitement, and had evidently 
been distiirbed. All my hopes of young emus suddenly 
sank down to zero. I did everything I conld devise to 
entice the bird back again to the nest, but it was all of 
no avail. When, from further observation, I was con- 
vinced it was a case of hopeless disturbance from some 
unknown cause, I reported the state of affairs indoors, 
where the disappointment was fully equal to mine, and 
sat down to think. 

" It was really touching to see that fine neat of eggs — 
not an everyday production in this country, and so near 
completion of their period for bursting into fresh life — 
exposed to the cold world without protection ! The 
first thing I did was to take out a bucket of moderately 
warm water, into which the eggs were all plunged, to 
arrest their further chilling, in case of there being any 
life in them. My wife then improvised a sand-bath, by 
means of a large saucepan or fish-kettle, which ■ 
placed over the boiler by the side of the kitchen fire. 

" Into this the most likely eggs were transferred, and 
carefully covered with flannel. In the meantime she 
liad performed the old farmhouse experiment of immers- 
ing them individually in hot water, and pronounced that 



DOMESTICATION W ENGLAND. 

there was actual life in at least five of them. This 
eucouraged us to persevere. I had previously aBcer- 
tained, for the sake of information, the heat of an ordi- 
dary sitting hen, and found it to be about 93°-94°. I 
allowed io° more, as probable for those large semi-tropi- 
cal birds, I got my sand-batli therefore up to 104°, and 
endeavoured to keep it within the range of 100° to 
108°. I wrote off to the Zoological Gardens, stating my 
misfortune, hardly supposing, but asking if anything 
. could be done, and begging, if so, they would let me 
know by telegram ; and I sat up with the sand-bath 
nearly all night, regulating the temperature, and occa- 
sionally turning the eggs. 

" The next afternoon — delayed from our post address 
not happening to coincide with our nearest railroad sta- 
tion — I received the following telegraphic message :— 
' Send up the eggs ; ve have, a bird that will hatch theni.' 
The effect was almost electrical. Though Low — what 
bird, what hopes, what certainty — was all a mystery ; 
we had nothing to do but gratefully and implicitly to 
obey in faith, to the best of our ability. It was then 
just too late to catch our last train, with time to return 
the same evening; and having mastered the regulation 
of the temperature, and feeling confident there was no 
further injury being sustained, 1 did not think it well to 
run the risk of hurry, but took another night at watch- 
ing and regulating, 

" The next morning a quantity of bran was made hot, 
the eggs carefully packed with it in a tin case, the whole 
rapidly enveloped in many folds of flannel, and de- 
spatched per first train by the hand of a careful mes- 
senger, with instructions to use every reasonable celerity. 
He arrived at the gardens with them quite safely, and 



156 THE SPOTTED EMU. 

found the superintendeut ready to receive them ; they 
were taken out still quite warm, and immediately placed 
under an emu, which for the last fortnight had wanted 
to sit, without any eggs I 

"The reward of this care and perseverance against 
such a multitude of chances, and the really extraordinary 
part of the business, is, that in the course of the follow- 
ing week four young emus were hatched out, to the no 
small interest and gratification of all concerned, and no 
doubt to the astonishment of the bird, which had sat . 
for such an abnormally short time for the living result. 
The brood formed one of the advertised attractions of 
the gardens during the early part of last season. One 
of them lived only about six weeks ; another, which 
grew up with a defective spine, died in the winter; the 
other two still grace the gardens, having arrived at 
nearly full emu's estate. There was also a fine chick in 
an egg that had received a crack, and two or three other 
immature ones that did not come to the birth. Thu 
eggs in the incubator did not hatch. 

" My poor emu, which had sat so long, and was th.us 
deprived of the natural reward, was very emaciated and 
out of spirits for some time. On close scrutiny, a day or 
two after, I found emus' footmarks along several beds in 
the garden, and tracked one pretty evidently forced 
between bushes, where it would not voluntarily have 
gone, as if driven. I learned subsequently that they 
were seen that morning out of their boundaries. My 
interpretation is, that knowing of the absence of the 
family, some stranger entered the premises, which are

purpose of shooting, or with rod and line for fishing, 
and unwittingly disturbed it — a strange dog would lead 
to a fearful commotion — had left the gate of the enclosure 
open, carelessly or in alarm, through which the emus had 
rushed, had got them back again somehow, and effected 
his escape, uncognisant, it might be, of the whole mischief. 

"During the summer my birds improved, both in 
jilumage and condition, upon the preyious season. From 
all I could observe, I still believed the smaller one to be 
the female, the larger the male. On the 29th of Decem- 
ber I went down, as was often my custom, about four 
o'clock in the afternoon, to see after their welfare. I 
was alarmed at finding the larger bird with symptoms 
of being very unwell. It hissed at me, and strained 
with its neck violently, as if choking, and I thought it 
must have got something in its throat. I was going 
immediately for assistance, when I bethought me I 
would try and get it into its house first; and for this 
pui-pose attempted to diive it, when it gave another 
great retch, and — an egg dropped upon the ground! 
The illness was all over. This bird quietly walked oflF 
with the most perfect indifference, and at the same 
moment down inished the other one, in a state of the 
gi'Catest excitement, rolled the egg — fortunately un- 
broken by the fall — over and over till pleased with its 
location, and finally covered it with leaves, thus defini- 
tively settling the question of sexes, the extraordina.ry 
reversal of habits and manners by which we had been 
misled, and the crowning fact of the male bird doing all 
the sitting, and, as I had afterwards the opportunity of 
witnessing, of bringing up the young ones entirely. 

" It was nearly six weeks earlier than the previous 
season for the laying to commence. In preparation,

however, for the occurrence, I had a much more suitable 
house built, better protected from casualties, open still 
in front-in order not to give the air of confinement 
to those freedom-loving birds — and hung inside with 
branches of the evergreen conifers, to present somewhat 
of a natural and homeish appearance. The next egg 
followed on the fourth day after the first one, namely, 
on the second day of the New-year ; the third on the 
fifth day after that ; and then there was an addition 
every third day, with perfect regularity, up to the thir- 
teenth, which again took four days, and the fourteenth 
six days. There was no difl&culty in inducing the lay- 
ing bird to take to the new house. The same precau- 
tions were adopted as last season in removing the eggs 
as deposited during the severe weather, and replacing 
them by artificial ones. Precisely at the same relative 
period as before — ^namely, after the laying of the thir- 
teenth egg, the other bird — whom we may now unhesi- 
tatingly designate by his proper pronoun he — ^became 
increasingly busy about the eggs, and began to show 
symptoms of making the same kind of rude nest in the 
hollow provided, and finally settling on St. Valentine's 
Day, the 14th of February 1862. The eggs, as last 
year, had almost regularly increased in size and weight, 
from I lb. 2i oz. to i lb. 70Z., the average being con- 
siderably above the previous season. It was thought 
best to keep back the four first, as the smallest and least 
to be depended upon, and he was therefore set upon ten 
eggs, being perhaps as many as was prudent. 

" The next day I was favoured with a visit from Mr. 
A. D. Bartlett, the prompt and energetic superinten- 
dent of the. Zoological Gardens, who had been duly 
informed from time to time of the progress of events. 



DOMESTICATION IN ENGLAND. 



He was pleased to a.pprove of the axrangenieiita entirely, 
but thought the bii'd would cover the whole number of 
eggs, and that therefore the four which had been kept 
back — and which I wished him to take to experi- 
ment upon, but he declined, as they had no bird then 
likely to adopt them, and he had no faith in the incu- 
bator — might be safely added to the nest. I divided 
the matter, giving the bird two more, quite sufiicieiit, 
as it afterwards proved, and attempted to batch the 
other two by means of an impromptu incubator, Avhich 
I need scarcely say failed entirely. 

" "VVe made several experiments to ascertain the heat 
generated by the bird, with a very susceptible Nigi'etti 
and Zambra's thermometer he had brought for the pur- 
pose ; but probably from not giving time enough, or the 
normal heat not being yet developed, did not obtain up 
to quite 90° whUe the eupei'intendent was here. I pur- 
sued the experimeuts afterwai'da with one of Caseila's 
pretty little instruments, made for the purpose ; but the 
last time it was put under the bird for the night I was 
unable to find it again iu the morning without more 
disturbance than I liked to risk with so large an area 
of search. When discovered, which was not till the 
sitting was over, it was unfortunately broken. The 
highest temperature I actually observed was 96°. A 
large Dorking heu, with the same instrument, registered 
103° as the maximum, average 98°, 

"Last season I noted that tliree more eggs were laid 
into the nest after the bird was settled. This year we 
had the opportunity of seeing the female bird delibe- 
rately walk up to the neat, and therein deposit another 
egg, without materially disturbing the sitting bird, who 
immediately took proper charge of it. The process did

not take above one minute, so that it required to be in 
luck's way to have the opportunity of witnessing it. 
This must have been repeated four times, for the first 
time the bird was off long enough to enable me to get 
a good view of the nest, there were sixteen eggs in it I 
This, I believe, was too many. At times, during the 
long period of incubation, they were not all completely 
covered. The sitting was as assiduous as last year, but 
this season I adopted the plan of feeding the bird regu- 
larly on the nest, rather than he should famish himself 
as before. He took comparatively little, but the restless 
period at the end of four weeks did not supervene. 

" In the fifth week I found one of the eggs broken in 
the nest, with an embryo chick in process of formation. 
This was encouraging, independently of the loss. Exactly 
a fortnight afterwards the same thing occurred again. 
The progress towards chickenhood was very marked; 
the head, beak, and legs were perfectly formed, and the 
feathers over the body had made their appearance. I 
was somewhat uneasy at the cause of these accidents, 
when, a day or two afterwards, happening to catch the 
bird off the nest, I saw the one that was at large — the 
hen-bird — deliberately walk up, and, with a scolding 
air, endeavour, with her strong neck acting as a lever, 
to force her faithful partner down upon the nest again. 
In this attempt of course a struggle ensued, and thus 
it was, no doubt, the fractures had occurred. Not being 
disposed to run any further risk from the same cause, I 
shut the hen-bird off from that time. 

" Eight weeks were completed without further acci- 
dent. We were on the tiptoe of daily expectation. 
Nine weeks elapsed without result. We all began to 
look serious. Two days more expired fruitlessly, and I

believe all but myself had quite given up all hopes. 
The Itird still continued to sit unweariedly, aud I thought 
of the last four eggs laid into the neat, the nonnal time 
for all of which could not have yet been exhausted. 
Judge of the reaction when, on visiting the nest in a 
half melancholy, desponding mood, the first thing ou 
the morning of Easter Sunday, the 20th of April, I 
descried an evident cast-out shell, and, on looking more 
closely, the striped body of a young emu protruding 
from under — not the wing, for it has none — but the fos- 
tering side of its parent 1 I hardly knew bow to break 
the tidings indoors. The nezt day produced another ; 
and two days more a thii-d broke its way out of the 
shell. The bird continued to sit to the end of the week. 
Two dead chicks were found in two other eggs ; the rest 
proved addled. 

" The eldest young emu was weakly from the first. 
A pellicle of skin continued drawn over one eye for 
several days, and I am not sure it ever obtained its full 
sight. It died in the fifth week. The other two are in 
high health, and thriving. They are now towards eight 
months old, have lost theii" infantile striped plumage, 
are apparently about half-grown, and very saucy, and 
are beginning to think themselves veritable emus. I 
must not omit one remai'kable set of phenomena that 
now became developed. For the firat month the young 
ones were very tenderly watched and guai-ded within 
their house, the father being most assiduous, gentle, 
and attentive in their nurturing. Having somewhat 
established themselves in the world, they were given 
a little more liberty. The first time the mother-bird 
caught sight of the little ones she became much excited, 
seized one of them by the head, and tlirew it a regular

sommersault up into the air. A scuflBie ensued between 
the big birds, by which I became alarmed for the safety 
of the young ones, and was obliged to interfere. At 
first I thought it might be only jealousy or natural 
excitement that would soon subside, or an odd and 
antipodean way of showing pleasure ; but, with further 
experience, became convinced it meant mischief on the 
part of the mother-bird.^ They were, therefore, con- 
tinued to be kept separated, but only by a wire fence, 
in order that they might be so far in company, and 
become familiarised. , 

^^The time arrived when we thought the parent birds 
at least ought again to associate, and would no doubt 
be glad of each other s society. They were introduced 
accordingly by the removal of a portion of the fence, 
when the female bird rushed upon the male, and drove 
him round and round, endeavouring to strike him with 
her strong foot forward, whenever she could get him 
into a comer, till I was obliged at last to separate them 
again. The loss of feathers, if not of blood, was con- 
siderable. Here was an unexpected dilemma, beyond 
the jurisdiction of Sir Cresswell. The experiment was 
repeated several times, with the same result, until, in 
fact, the persecuted * weaker vessel ' was driven by a 
fierce charge to leap the fence, in doing which he tore 
a long wound in his neck, and might have been seriously 
injured. This evidenced real hostility on the one part, 
and fear on the other. Thinking the presence of the 
young ones might possibly be the cause of oflfence, and 
deeming they were now able to shift for themselves, I

common emu and young at Clumber. See "The Field," 12th September 
1868. 



DOMESTICATION IN ENGLAND. 

determined to wean them, and, as a preparatory step, 
removed them and their father to another enclosure, as 
much out of sight and hearing as could be an-anged. 
They were some time in getting settled in their new 
habitat, especially the little ones, who appear to have 
the organ of locality very largely developed. In intro- 
ducing the male bird again to his companion, it was 
necessary to take the young ones as well, as they would 
not be parted. Precisely the same scene recurred as at 
first — namely, a violent charge, by which the male was 
overpowered by the female, and obliged to run ; but 
after a little while the former gained courage, beat off 
the latter, and completely turned the tables, the young 
ones joining heartily in the chase with either party. 
This was repeated day after day, without any progress 
towards a settlement of the domestic difficulty, and to 
the extent of the heavier bulk of the hen-bird becoming 
distressed by exhaustion, and she showed symptoms of 
being sorely frightened whenever she saw the approach 
of her lawful mate. I now sepai-ated the young ones 
entirely, and shut the male bird up, to reduce his spirit 
in turn. This had the desired effect. On being let out 
together, after three days' confinement, she was again 
master. They were now transferred into a field, where 
there was plenty of room for them to run, without 
danger of doing much mischief to each other. Here 
the more agile and lithesome male readily escaped from 
his persecutor, and she had to give it up for a while, 
until sufficiently recovered to renew the chase, with the 
same result. They are getting weary, after a fortnight, 
with this sort of daily occupation, and are gradually 
becoming more reconciled to each other's presence. I 
expect very shortly the male bird will turn again, assert 



1 64 THE SPOTTED EMU. 

his natural equality at least, and that they will make it 
up for another season. 

"The final parting of the young ones with their father 
was very hard work. The poor little things, as soon as 
they found themselves alone, set up the most plaintive 
cries, lasting all through the night and the following 
day or two, and beat themselves about, until one had 
made its head and neck quite sore, against the sides of 
the enclosure — incessantly haunting that side towards 
where their paternal guardian, friend, and playmate 
had been taken. He appeared to forget them in about 
a week. They still commence every morning with their 
plaintive cry of distress, though now the third week 
since their separation." 

Mr. Bennett continued his experiments, and the fol- 
lowing year reported as follows ^ : — 

" I left my young emus (Zool. 8323) just parted from 
their afiectionate father, and not yet fully reconciled to 
beginning the world on their own account. The sense 
of deprivation gradually wore off, and occasionally they 
were indulged with an interchange of visits, in order to 
keep up acquaintanceship and mutual interest. During 
the winter they had each a severe illness, one following 
the other. My friend John Steele, one of our ablest 
medical practitioners of Reigate, and a warm naturalist, 
hearing of their indisposition, called professionally. On 
examination of the symptoms, apprehending it was the 
liver that was affected, probably by the difference of our 
climate, he prescribed one-grain calomel pills, to be 
given every third day, followed by a gentle aperient. 
They were very difficult patients to administer any-

thing to. Somehow, however, this was mauaged foi* a 
fortnight, and they both recovered, after one had been 
entirely given over. They are now grown fine birds, 
nearly as tall as their pareuts, hut not, I think, mature 
for another season at least. The two are very different 
in their bearing and manners, one being much higher 
spirited and less tractable than the other; but both 
have for some months began to put on the hoom, the 
peculiar indication of the female bird, though one is 
much more distinctly pronounced than the other, and it 
is exceedingly different to determine the sexes until 
quite mature. They likewise had a severe quarrel, last- 
ing for nearly a month, in the spring, which looks like 
jealousy, but perhaps it was only to establish supremacy, 
for they are now entirely at peace. The two from the 
same stock of the preceding season, in the Zoological 
Gardens, Regent's Park, have thriven well, are now 
considered to have arrived at maturity, and are pro- 
nounced both males. My adult birds became reconciled 
to each other in due course, 

" The next season {1863) was most prolific in eggs, but 
proved an entire failure as to any furtlier result. The 
laying commenced on the 2d of January. There was 
an interval of four days between each of the three fol- 
lowing eggs, and then the process, continued with the 
utmost regularity, on every third day, even to the time 
of the afternoon. It was invariably within a margin of 
one hour on either side of four o'clock that an egg was 
deposited, up to the twentieth in number (see 'Diary,' 
Zool. 8494). I had learned to interpret the voice of 
the bird, namely, a low muttering sound she regularly 
makes for an hour or so before laying, which rendered 
the observation of the time a matter of but little diffi- 



1 66 THE SPOTTED EMU. 

culty, whenever I was at home. The same precautions 
were taken with respect to the safety of the eggs from 
frost as the previous season. After the number of eggs 
had been laid, the male bird exhibited the usual symp- 
toms, and he was set upon thirteen eggs on the 5 th of 
March. 

The early period of sitting was as close as before. 
The first view obtained of the contents of the nest was 
on the 9th, when two more eggs were found to have 
been added. The bird at large was seen to deposit an- 
other on the 1 2 th. It was on the 21st before another 
view of the nest was obtained. There were then seven- 
teen eggs in it. Three were removed, under the idea 
that there would be still as many as the bird could do 
justice to. An incubator was started for the reception 
of the surplus eggs. 

" The bird at large continued to lay until the enormous 
number of twenty-eight was completed. From the 
average known weight of the bulk of them, it must 
have amounted to about 40 lbs. in all. 

"The manaorement of the incubator was conducted 

o 

exactly as recommended at the Zoological Gardens, as 
nearly as circumstances admitted, except that the ave- 
rage temperature aimed at being maintained was 104** 
instead of 108°. All my subsequent observations lead 
me to conclude that the former may be somewhat too 
high. During the first four weeks everything went on 
admirably. In the fifth week I was summoned from 
home by the illness of a near relative. Though only 
absent a day or two, a source of disturbance occurred 
which I did not know of till afterwards. Nothing amiss 
with the sitting bird was detected on my return. Early 
on the afternoon of the following day, however, I found 



DOMESTICATION IN ENGLAND. 

the bird off the nest, and wandering about, to my great 
dismay, in a state of the utmost excitement. Nothing 
could reconcile him, or attract him back again to the 
nest. After some inquiry, I learned that a pleasure- 
boat had just gone up the river (a privilege we by 
no means wish to deny our neighbours up or down our 
sullen, but attractive and sylvan little stream), and that 
previously in the week another, or the same boat, had 
lauded some of the party, to notice the birds during my 
absence from home. The sight of strangers, especially 
ladies in black, or with flying gay ribbons, or loud 
voices, or unaccustomed noises of any kind, always 
greatly disturbs and excites them. But it was the plash 
and sound of the sculls in rowing, that I believe was 
the great cause of offence. I have since noticed that the 
beating of a carpet or a drum, anywhere within hearing 
in the neighbourhood, greatly distresses them ; and I 
have now no doubt that it was a boat coming up the 
river that Sunday morning that was the unknown and 
mysterious cause of disturbance on the first occasion. 
1 had ample evidence that the sight or sound of a 
boat is something of which these birds have a re- 
markable dread or antipathy to, when, on going my 
round two or three days afterwards, 1 again found the 
two young emus, then a year old, in a state of the 
greatest anger and alarm, with flaming eyes and mouths 
open, one of them having leaped the fence in its terror. 
On looking round for the cause, ihtre was the boat, Lav- 
ing just landed opposite their enclosure — come to make 
an apology — the lady and gentlemen having heard of

persevered in till hopeless. All the more likely eggs 
were then removed to the incubator. As I anticipated, 
the bird sat again that night, and the bulk of the eggs 
were restored. I clung to the hope that he would for- 
give and forget the offence, and resume the sitting, 
though, from certain symptoms observed, I was not very 
sanguine. My first visit in the morning satisfied me it 
was all over. The bird was oif the nest, and chafing 
violently against the railed door of the house, which 
had heen shut that night for safety. The eggs were 
returned to the incubator. 

" No accident that need have been fatal to the success- 
ful hatching out of at least some of the egg^ happened, 
as far as I am aware of, to the incubator. Some ordi- 
nary chickens were hatched in it during the process. But 
two months is a long time to keep up the normal condi- 
tions; and many little delicate handlings of Nature 
repeatedly wanting, may tell. Various eggs, one after 
another, gave undoubted signs of being addled, and 
were removed ; and all, but not till after they were 
much overdue, were eventually given up. I tried to 
console myself with the thought that perhaps the whole 
batch this season might be barren eggs, and thus aflTord 
a possible reason why the bird was the more readily dis- 
turbed. Experience has since shown that the reason 
would have failed had the fact proved so. All my dis- 
appointment and mortification returned in full, when, 
on preparing the eggs for specimens, by emptying the 
contents, I found, altogether, a large number of embryo 
chicks, in various stages of development — several with 
beak, claws, and plumage complete — apparently just 
ready to break through the shell 1 The process must, 
therefore, have gone on properly in the incubator, very 



DOMESTICATION IN ENGLAND. i6g 

nearly to maturity ; but I very much doubt, from sub- 
sequent experience, whether aDy of these, if healthily 
hatched, could have had strength to have been healthily 
reared. 

" I think I may say my adult birds continue to improve 
in manners and plumage every year, so far. The first 
egg this season was dropped on the 23d of December 
1863, as usual, in the first place, down by the water- 
side. Another was not found till nine days afterwards, 
namely, on New Year's Day, and the third not till the 
12th of the month. One, however, was subsequently 
found, down by the water, in a dirty condition, that had 
evidently been long laid, which probably intervened, 
and possibly more than one may have been lost. The 
two next eggs occupied four days each, and then the 
laying proceeded every third day, with the aecuatomed 
regularitj', and the observance of the average time of 
four o'clock in the afternoon. The total number laid 
this season does not nearly reach to last ; but they have 
annually increased in size, several this year weighing 
over li lb. It is very curious the bird, in sitting, kept 
the precise anniversary of the year before last, namely, 
St, Valentine's Day, the 1 4th of February. The num- 
ber of eggs he was settled upon, in the first place, was 
ten. Extra precautions had this year been taken to 
shut out any unusual sight or sound, and promote per- 
fect quiet, by the erection of a double screen of ever- 
greens before the house, and a bar was respectfully 
placed on the proprietors of boats, not to pass beyond a 
certain point for the necessary period. 

"The bird sat, if possible, more closely than usual; 
BO much so, that a sight was not obtained of the nest 
till the expiration of the fourth week. It was then

found to contain fifteen eggs, so that five had during 
the time been laid into it. As heretofore, the bird, 
after this period, became much more restless. The eggs 
had been marked on previous occasions, so as to en- 
deavour to learn their individual history, but the mark- 
ings had not proved permanent. This year a pigment 
of copal varnish and vermilion was employed, and each 
egg, as laid, conspicuously numbered in two places, 
which proved effective. In the sixth week the last laid 
egg was found turned out of the nest ; and, as they had 
not always been well covered, it was not replaced. 
Early in the seventh week an experiment was tried on 
one of the eggs, in the usual way, with hot water, and 
it showed manifest signs of life ; and the hen-bird was 
now shut off for fear of disturbance. On the 6th of 
April an egg was found laid just outside the house, 
because she could not get in ! The closing day of the 
eighth week the sitting bird was most uncomfortably 
restless throughout, and gave me much anxiety about 
the result, but settled again towards night. The first 
thing next morning, I found an egg turned right out, 
and being a slope, had rolled a considerable distance. It 
was stone-cold. I brought it in, however, and thought 
we would just try it with hot water. To our wonder 
and admiration it kicked — that is, the chick within it — 
most vigorously! Of course it was instantly replaced 
under the bird. The following morning the same egg was 
again found rolled out of the nest, but not to so great a 
distance, and it had not become so cold. What could 
this mean? It was again treated with hot water, and 
not only manifestly moved with increased strength, but 
a distinct chirp was heard inside I Again on the next 
morning three more eggs, all differing in their number 



DOMESTICATION IN ENGLAND. 171 

to the previous one, were turned out and exposed ; so it 
was not any particular antipathy to that unfortunate 
egg. They were all tried, and showed ample signs of 
life, and upon being placed close to the ear, a strong 
internal movement, like fez-mentation, was distinctly 
perceptiUe. They were all immediately replaced. Ou 
the next morning, April I3tli, the first young emu was 
hatched out, to our great delight : it was No. 1 3, the 
identical egg that had been twice dislodged from the 
neat, and once was taken up ao deathlike cold ! On the 
14th, Nos. 12 and 10 hatched out, and on the 15th, 
Nos. 5, 1 1, and 7. On the morning of the i6tb a death 
waa found to have occurred in the night. It was not 
one of the last three, and there was no apparent cause. 
I am strongly inclined to suspect it was poor unfortunate 
No. 13, a large, strong chick to all appearances, but 
perhaps died from inflammation or a cold caught in 
the egg from that night's exposure. It was replaced, 
however, by No. 8 being hatched in the course of 
the day. 

" The day following was a day of rest. The next 
morning produced another, an unnumbered egg, being 
the first, no doubt, of the additional ones laid into 
the nest. The three remaining of the original num- 
bered eggs were now tried, found to be lifeless, and 
removed. 

" There were still three left of the additional more 
recently laid eggs, which would each require the corre- 
sponding multiple of at least three days for the normal 
time of hatching. Two of these exhibited unmistak- 
able signs of life, and one distinctly chirped. 

" The bird, with his large family about him, was now 
naturally very much off the nest by day. The two 



172 HIE SPOTTED EMU. 

living eggs were therefore brought away, and exposed to 
the full aun (ranging from ioo° to ii8°), whenever it 
served, or kept by the fire at something over ioo°, and 
put under the bird at night. The more forward of the 
above two was safely hatched on the 22d. The other 
one progressed in strength daily ; was heard to chirp 
four days beforehand, but did not begin to break out of 
the shell till the 28th. It was nineteen hours in com- 
pletely extricating itself, and that not without some 
assistance from its parent, and even from its active 
elder brothers and sisters, to the eminent peril, appar- 
ently, of its poor little life. It was not healthily hatched, 
though it grew and gained in strength for several days. 
It had one foot cramped from the first, and being once 
fed (forced with food), never took anytliing of its own 
accord. Over-heating is almost an invariable cause of 
weakuess and cramp, and I think it had probably too 
much before the fire. It had to be nursed almost 
entirely indoors, and during its short life became evi- 
dently much attached to those about it. Though it could 
only hobble at best, it would follow me when doing 
little matters in the sunshine about the garden, and 
would utter the familiar plaintive cry when I was long 
out of sight. It was always put back to its parent at 
night, and was found crushed in the nest on the mom-. 
ing of the 8th, aged ten days. The remaining egg was 
finally abandoned. Thus a brood of ten young emus 
has been hatched this season altogether. One other 
misfortune I have to record. On returning home late 
from a necessary day's absence, and proceeding at once, 
as usual, to the emu-house, I found one fine strong 
little one, the second in age, I believe, stretched lifeless 
on the ground, from an accident, I apprehend, that

further experience may avoid. The remaining seven 
are thriving well, grow fast, all but one appear quite 
healthy, and they form a moat lively and interesting 
family. A trying period cornea on at about four months 
of age. 

" It was found necessary to separate the mother bird 
as before, on the young ones being let out. The parents 
spar occasionally across the fence when anything occuiis

little ones, and steps about amongst them with the moat

other supposed enemy, make its appearance, and the 
scene la absolutely sublime. She is in full sight of 
them, and struts about with a full pouting breast of 
feathers, and evident satisfaction, like a great turkey- 
cock. The young ones, instead of the ashy brown adult 
plumage, are elegantly longitudinally striped, their heads 
very prettily dappled; they are anything but shy, feed- 
ing freely out of the hand, and are very playful, imitating 
all the odd actions of the parent birds. 

" I draw the following conclusions, in addition to or 
in correction of former observations, as to the habits of 
these singular birds : — 

" I. The normal period of incubation is about sixty 
days, 

" 2. The number hatched in the natural state is 
probably very small, though the number of eggs is so 
large. The eggs are probably laid about, with an affec- 
tion for sheltered damp places, and when tbe breeding 
comes, the male bird gathers together the few he can

two or three are hatched, walks oflF with them away from 
the mother bird, leaving the rest to perish. 

« 3. The principle of life is remarkably strong in 
the young bird, both while an embryo in the egg and 
afterwards." 

It appears that the number of eggs laid by each hen, 
aod deposited every third day, is very variable, ranging 
from seven or eight to eighteen ; but it is said that, to 
ensure a brood, a bird ought not to be allowed to sit on 
more than eight or nine.^ The chief difficulty to be 
encountered is the weather, which, at the early period 
of the year when these birds lay (i.e., January and 
February), is often very inclement. Due precautions 
therefore should be taken to provide shelter and warmth, 
without at the same time interfering with the birds' 
liberty.

No account of the stnithious or ostrich-liki3 birds would 
be complete without some allusion, however slight, to 
that remarkable wingless form which inhabits New 
Zealand, and is there called by the natives " Kiwi," 
while to scientific naturalists it is known as the 
apteryx. 

Four species are stated to exist, and to be exclusively 
confined to New Zealand, but being incapable of flight, 
and hunted down upon every opportunity, it is evident 
that, like other wingless birds which have preceded 
them, they must ere long succumb to their numerous 
enemies, and eventually become classed amongst the 
forms which are extinct. 

A complete account of these singular birds, which 
even to the present day form the most distinctive 
feature in the avifauna of the country which they in- 
habit, would not only occupy more space than could be 
here accorded to the subject, but is rendered more or 
less unnecessary from the fact that the labours of others 
have already placed on record, in a connected form, to 
which we shall presently refer, all that has hitherto been 
ascertained regarding them. 



176 THE AFTER YX. 

We shall, therefore, do no more than oflfer some 
general observations on the distinguishing characters of 
the ApterygidcBj with a few remarks on the habits of the 
better known species. 

Although, as in the ostrich, the head is small, and the 
neck large and muscular, the bill is long, broad at the 
base, and tapers in a curve to the extremity, which is 
slightly dilated. The wings, which are rudimentary, 
are quite concealed by the dorsal plumage, the feathers 
of which are lanceolate, and composed externally of long 
disunited filaments, the downy portion towards the root 
much developed, and exceeding in extent the exposed 




Foot of Apteryx. 

or hairy portion. They are destitute, moreover, of the 
accessary plumule so highly developed in some of the 
struthious birds, but the basal or concealed portion of 
each feather is fine and silky.^ The thighs are pro- 
minent and very muscular ; the feet robust, and armed 
with sharp claws, while a hind-toe, which is not present 
in any of the Struthionidce, is in the Apterygidce promi- 
nently developed. In old birds the scales which cover 



1 The difference of structure in the feathers of the Apten/gidce and 
Struthionida may be seen at a glance on referring to Mr. Dawson Row- 
ley's plate of feathers, which illustrates his remarks on this subject in his 
" Ornithological Miscellany," part I. 



OSTEOLOGY AND ANATOMY. 177 

the taraL and toes are closely set, with overlapping edges, 
and are perfectly smooth ; in the young they are soft 
and detached, presenting a reticulated surface. 

A well-known observer in New Zealand, Mr. T. H. 
Potts, has remarked,' that after looking over numbers 




of ail the known species of apterys, he has arrived at 
the conclusion that no specific character can be safely 
drawn from the skin of the tarsus being scutellate or 
reticulate. 

Their osteology and anatomy have been exhaustively 
treated by Professor Owen in several able memoii's con- 
tributed to the "Transactions " of the Zoological Society;

and as regards their life history, Mr. BuUer's recently 
published work, " The Birds of New Zealand," and Mr. 
Dawson Rowley's essays in the " Ornithological Miscel- 
lany," contain almost all that is known of their haunts 
and habits. 

Although possessing certain characters which connect 
them obviously with the StruthionidcB or ostrich family, 
the ApterygidcB are, after all, but distantly related to 
these birds; and, as Professor Nathusius has pointed 
out, the structure of the egg-shell in Apteryx does not 
much agree with other Strtithiones}

DISTRIBUTION AND LIFE HISTORY. 



I readily distinguishable from the other bird, and that the 
variation is constant ; while Professor Kirk agreed with 
Dr. Finsch, who proposes to call it Apteryx australis, 
variety manteUi, considering that the bird discovered in 
the North Island is merely a variety of the species in 
the South {Apteryx australis), the slight difference 
between them being insufBcient to warrant their 
separation. 

With the life history of these birds we are as yet 
imperfectly acquainted. The North Island kiwi is 
perhaps the best known, and of the habits of this 
species, so far as have been ascertained, Mr. BuUer has 
given the following account in hia "Birds of New 
Zealand " : — 

" The kiwi is in some measure compensated for the 
absence of wings by its swiftness of foot. When 
running, it makes wide strides and carries the body 
in an oblique position, with the neck stretched to its 
full extent and inclined forwards. In the twilight it 
moves about cautiously and as noiselessly as a rat, to 
which, indeed, at this time, it bears some outward 
resemblance. In a quiescent posture, the body generally 
assumes a perfectly rotund appearance ; and it some- 
times, but only rarely, supports itself by resting the 
point of its bill on the ground. It often yawns when 
disturbed in the daytime, gaping its mandibles in a 
very grotesque manner. When provoked, it erects the 
body, and raising the foot to the breast, strikes down- 
wards with considerable force and rapidity, thus using 
its sharp and powerful claws as weapons of defence. 
The story of its striking the ground with its feet to 
bring the earthworms to the surface, which appears to 
have gained currency among naturalists, is as fanciful 



i8o THE APTERYX. 

as the statement of a well-known author that it is 
capable of ' inflicting a dangerous blow, sometimes even 
killing a dog I ' 

"While hunting for its food the bird makes a continual 
sniffing sound through the nostrils, which are placed at 
the extremity of the upper mandible. "Whether it is 
guided as much by touch as by smell I cannot aafely 
say ; hut it appeai-s to me that both senses are called 
into action. That the sense of touch is highly developed 
seems quite certain, because the bird, although it may 
not be actually sniffing, will always first touch an object 
with the point of its bill, whether in the act of feeding 
or of surveying the ground ; and when shut up in a 
cage or confined in a room, it may be heard all through 
the night tapping softly at the walls. The snilfing 
sound to which I have referred is heard only when the 
kiwi is in the act of feeding or hunting for food ; but I 
have sometimes observed the bird touching the ground 
close to or immediately round a worm which it had 
dropped without being able to find it, I have re- 
marked, moreover, that the kiwi will pick up a worm or 
a piece of meat as readily from the bottom of a vessel 
filled with water as from the ground, never seizing it, 
however, till it baa first touched it with its biU in the 
manner described. It is probable that, in addition to 
a highly developed olfactory jiower, there is a deKcate 
nervous sensitiveness in the terminal enlargement of the 
upper mandible. It is interesting to watch the bird, in 
a state of freedom, foraging for worms, which constitute 
its principal food : it moves about with a slow action of 
the body, and the long flexible bill is driven into the 
soft ground, generally home to the very root, and is 
either immediately withdrawn with a worm held at the 



HA UNTS AND HABITS. 



extreme tip of the mandibles, or it is gently moved to 
and fro by an action of the head and neck, the body of 
the bird being perfectly steady. It is amusing to observe 
the extreme care and deliberation with which the bird 
draws the worm from its hiding-place, coaxing it out aa 
it were by degrees, instead of pulling roughly or break- 
ing it. On getting the worm fairly out of the ground, 
it throws up its head with a jerk, and ewallowa it 
whole, 

"The stomach of a recently killed wild bird which I 
dissected contained a hinau-berrj- [El(EQcarpus dentatus) 
and rounded fragments of white quartz. Dr. Day ^vrites 
me — ' In its very muscular stomach I have usually 
found the remains of beetles, pebbles, and many hard 
kernels of the hinau-bcrry.' " 

The Zoological Society of London has procured alive, 
at different times, three out of the four species of this 
singular genus, namely, Apteryx mantelli {australis of 
Sclater) ; Apteryx oweni, presented in 1869 by the 
Acclimatisation Society of Otago, as the first which 
had been brought alive to Europe ; and Apteryx haasti, 
a specimen of which was presented to the Society in 
December 1875 by Baron F. von Mueller. 

In 1859, an individual of the first-named species laid 
an egg in the Society's Gardens. It was smooth and of a 
dirty white colour — the form an elongated oval, sfightly 
tapering towards the smaller end, 475 inches in long, 
and 2^9 inches in short diameter. It weighed 14^ 
ounces, or nearly one-fourth of the weight of the bird 
itself, which was found by experiment to weigh 5o 
ounces. 

In Gould's "Handbook of the Birds of Australia," 
vol. ii. p. 570, several statements are made with refer-

ence to the mode of reproduction of the apteryx, but as 
these strange stories are most of them derived from the 
natives of New Zealand, and do not appear to have been 
verified by any one upon whom one can place much 
reliance, it may be aa well to record a few facts that 
have occurred under the observation of Mr. A. D, Bart- 
lett in tlie Gardens of the Zoological Society. Mr. Bart- 
lett says ^ : — 

"In 1 85 1, Lieutenant-Governor Eyre presented to the 
Society an apteryx. This bird proved to be a female of 
A2>te)'yx mantelli. 

"In the year 1859 she laid her fii-st eggs, and has 
continued to lay one or two eggs every year since that 
time. In 1865 a male bird was presented by Henry 
Slade, Esq. 

" During last year {1867) these birds showed symptoms 
of a desire to pair. This was known by the loud calling 
of the male, which was answered by the female in a 
much lower and shorter note. They were particularly 
noisy during the night, but altogether silent in the day- 
time. On the 2d of January the fir.st egg was laid, and 
for a day or more the female remained on the egg ; but 
as soon as she quitted the nest, the male bird took to it, 
and remained constantly sitting. 

" On the 7th of February the second egg was laid, 
the female leaving the nest as soon as the egg was de- 
posited. The two birds now occupied the two opposite 
comers of the room in which they were kept, the male 
on the two eggs in the neat under the straw, the female 
concealed in her comer, also under a bundle of straw 
placed against the wall. During the time of incubation 



' Proc. Zool. Soc, 1

tliej" ceased to call at nightj in fact, were perfectly silent, 
and kept apart. 

" I found the eggs in a hollow fonned on the ground 
in the earth and straw, and placed lengthwise side by 
side. The male bird lay across them, his narrow body 
appearing not sufl&cieutly broad to cover them in any 
other way; the ends of the eggs could be seen projecting 
from the side of the bird. 

" The male continued to sit in the most persevering 
manner until the 25th of April, at which time he waa 
much exhausted, and left the nest. On examining the 
eggs I found no trace of young birds. 

" Notwithstanding the failure of reproducing the 
apteryx, I think sufficient has been witnessed to show 
that this bird's mode of reproduction does not differ 
essentially from that of the allied struthious birds, in 
all cases of which that have come under my observa- 
tion, the male bird only sita. 

"I have witnessed the breeding of the moomk, the 
cassowary, the emu, and the rhea, and the mode of pro- 
ceeding of the apter}'x fully justifies me in believing the 
habits of this bird to he in no way materially different 
from those of its allies."

Although " ostrieh-fjirming," aa at present systemati- 
cally carried out in South Africa, la of comparatively 
recent date, the domestication of this bird for the sake 
of its feathers is not so great a novelty aa many might 
suppose. 

More than a century ago, the Swedish traveller. Dr. 
Sparrman, found that many farmers at the Cape had a 
number of tame ostriches on their farms, which were 
allowed to feed at large, and which supplied their owners 
with plumes which were made into brooms, and helped 
to drive away the mosquitoes.' Captain Lyon in his 
" Narrative of Travels in Northern Africa in the years 
1818, 1819, and 1820," states that at the towns of 



■■ " Voyage to the Cape of Good Hope," voL ii 
viaiied the Cape in 1775. 



T 88 OSTRICH-FA RMING. 

Sokna, Hoon, and Wadou it was then the custom to keep 
tame ostriches in yards or enclosures, and in two years 
to take three cuttings of their feathers ; and it has long 
been known that various tribes in Central Africa catcli 
and keep ostriches for the sake of their plumes, which 
they barter with traders, and which find their way into 
Egypt with the caravans from Senaar. 

But although the idea of ostrich-farming is not a new 
one, it is only within the last few years that the subject 
has come to engage serious attention. It became evident 
to reflecting minds that if buyers of ostrich plumes in 
Europe were to depend solely upon the receipt of such 
feathers as could be procured by hunting down and 
killing the birds in remote parts of Africa, their trade 
must soon altogether cease, since there would eventually 
be either no birds left to hunt, or they would be driven 
so far towards the wild and unknown interior as to render 
the pursuit of them attended with much risk and danger. 

Accordingly, the Acclimatisation Society of Paris took 
the subject in hand, and in 1859., through the liberality 
of one of its members, M. Chagot, offered premiums for 
the successful domestication of the ostrich in Algeria or 
Senegal, and for breeding ostriches in Europe.^ The first 
of such measures was to some extent successfully carried 
out in Algeria by M. Hardy, the Director of the Accli- 
matisation Gardens at Hamma, to whom the prize was 
accordingly awarded.^ 

About the same time Prince Demidoff commenced

2 An interesting account of M. Hardy's experiments in domesticating 
the ostrich in Algeria will be found detailed by himself in the BvUetin de 
la SociitS Imperiale d^ Acclimatationy 1857, p. 524, and 1868, p. 103. See 
also Riviere, torn, cit, p. 639, and 1870, p. 566. 



ITS HISTORY. 189 

expSriments in breeding ostriches on his property at San 
Donato near Florence, which resulted in his rearing, for 
the first time in Europe, two young ones in 1859, and 
six the following year. 

In i860 the same female ostrich laid fourteen eggs, 
the first oa May 1 1 , and one every second day until the 
31st. A twelfth was laid on June 3d, another on June 
4tli, and the last on June 5th. The female began to sit 
as soon as the first egg was laid, and sat for three hours 
daily, leaving the male to sit the rest of the time. The 
first young one made its appearance on June 23d, and 
was soon followed by three more, a fifth on the 24th, 
and a sixth on the 26th. The brood used regularly to 
pass the night under the parent's wing. There still 
remained eight eggs, but during a storm on the 26th 
the old bird became restless, quitted the nest, and would 
not return to it. Five of the eight eggs were found to 
be iu a fair way of being hatched, but the other three 
were addled. The two young birds hatched in 1859 
throve well and became full grown.^ 

The example thus set was ere long followed in other 
parts of Europe, notably by M. Noel-Suguet at Mar- 
seilles,' and by M. Boutcille, the curator of the Natural 
History Museum at Grenoble, who in 1864 communi- 
cated to the Acclimatisatiou Society of Paris the result 
of his successful experiments.^ At Madrid, also, Senor 
Graells achieved a similar success.* Thus it soon be-

came demonstrated that, under certain conditions easily 
attainable, there ia no great difficulty in inducing 
oatriehes to hatch their eggs in confinement, and rear 
their young. 

In 1857, the Acclimatisation Society of Paris, through 
the interveutitm of M. le Mar^chal VaiBant, obtained 
much valuable information from Algeria on the aubject 
of the ostrich and its domestication. This information, 
embodied in three Reports drawn up by Dr. Gosse, will 
be found in the " Bulletin de la Soci^t^ Imp^riale 
d'AccIimatation" for 1857,' to which periodical Dr. Gosse 
had already contributed an ai-ticle, " Des moeurs et dea 
habitudes de I'Autruche," which will well repay 



In the Cape Colony ostrichea were kept in encloaures 
for the sake of their feathers, which were cut periodi- 
cally, long before any means were devised or provision 
made for breeding them in confinement ; and amongst 
those who early contrived to make a profit from the 
practice was the late M. Jules Verreaux, aide-naturaliste 
at the Jardin des Plantes, Paris, who for many years 
resided with his brother Edouard in South Africa, and, 
jointly with him, rendered much service to the cause of 
zoology by means of the valuable series of animals 
and birds which, at great expenditure of time and 
money, were there collected. The experience of these 
gentlemen on the subject of ostrich-farming has been 
detailed by Dr. Gosse in the article above quoted. 

It would seem that the first instance of domesticated 
ostriches hatching their eggs in Cape Colony, so far as

ITS DEVELOPMENT. 



can be now ascertained, occurred in tbe Beaufort aud 
Oudtshoorn districts about the year 1866.^ Four years 
later young birds were successfully reared in the George 
district; and from that time to the present, the new 
industry of ostrich-farming has spread and thriven 
more or lees throughout the colony. 

In 1870, llr. W. Kinnear of Beaufort West (as appears 
by a communication from him to "The Cape Argus," 
published in November of that year), had twenty-nine 
ostriches on eight acres of garden-ground. He con- 
sidered that this extent of ground, being sown with 
lucerne and well watered, was capable of maintaining 
three times that number of birds throughout the year. 
For three pluckings of fifteen of them, at intervals of 
eight months, he received the sum of ^^240, which is at 
the rate of ^ 1 20 a year, or ^8 per bird. The other 
fourteen had not, at the date of his letter, attained their 
full plumage. 

According to a census taken in 1865, there were in 
that year only eighty tame birds in the colony. Last 
year {1875) the census returns showed the existence of 
no less than 32,247. These were found to be distributed 
as follows: — Eiversdale, in the west, 2892; Oudts- 
hoom, 2519; George, 1802; Calvinia, 1143; Willow-

"The plana adopted by Cape farmers in meeting the 
first requirement of domestication, that of limitation of 
space, have beeu various. Mr, Kinaear at Beaufort 
made his enclosure, eight acres in extent, BufBce for 
tldrty bu'da. He was obliged to sow these eight acres 
with lucerne, in order to provide food for his birds. 
Other breeders have given their bii'ds the run of their 
lands, trusting to careful herds, and the attractions of a 
daily feed of mealies at the homestead, Mr. White of 
Albany at one time gave an enclosure of five hundred 
acres to twenty-three young oatriches. Mr. Murray of 
Colesberg had about ninety within one thousand acres, 
walled round with stone, and he has now an enclosure 
of nearly five thousand acres for his larger fiocks. Mr. 
Douglas of Albany had his farm divided into about seven 
or eight large and well-fenced paddocks. It may be 
considered a settled law of ostrich-farming that free 
space and good fences are essential to success. Sheda, 
kraals, and houses are also necessary, not only for 
safe keeping, artificial hatching, and feather -gathering, 
but also for shelter from the cold and wet. The 
grazing ground best suited for the ostrich is that in 
which the soil or plants are rich in alkalies. When 
this is not the case, the needful element must be 
supplied." '

from Port Elizabeth in October 1875, says — "Impor- 
tant pointa to be considered are the space whicii the 
birds require, and the coat of enclosure. On a farm of 
300 morgen (a morgen being about two acres) one may 
keep about eighty birda on soft karoo veldt, about a 
hundred on grass veldt, but not more than fifty on 
hard karoo. Loose stone walla cost from a shilling to 
eighteenpeace a yard, according to the district. And 
where no walls can be built for want of stones, wire 
fences may be made. It has been found that four 
horizontal wires of galvanised iron are sufficient for an 
ostrich enclosure, and the cost of this, with the necessarj' 
uprights, may be put down at a shilling per yard. 80 
that an enclosure of the above dimensions will cost from 
^350 to /500." 

The following notes on ostrich -farming at the Cape 
were seut to the Council of the Zoological and Acclima- 
tisation Society of Victoria in 1873, and appear in the 
" Proceedings " of that Society for that year. They were 
written by a gentleman who resided many years in 
South Africa, and who had frequent opportunities of 
observing the mode of managing ostriches in that 
colony. 

"As a resident in South Africa," he says, "for eighteen 
years, in the districts lying north of the Orange liiver, 
where> in fact, the ostrich country begins, I beg to offer 
a few remarks for the general information of those who 
are not aware of the pecuniary advantages to be derived 
from the prosecution of this novel enterprise. 

" I was particularly impressed with the idea of such 
a scheme on my first visit to the western district some 
four years since. Previous to my dejiarture from Africa in 
1867, the experiment had been tried in various localities 




194 OSTRICH-FARMING. 

in the eastern province, between Graham's Town, Algoa 
Bay, and Cape Town. Dr. Atherstone took a prominent 
part in impressing upon the farmers generally the pos- 
sibility of such an enterprise proving successful. The 
only outlay requisite (a far more serious one than Vic- 
torians imagine, from the scarcity of timber and the 
expensive land transport) being the cost of enclosing a 
portion of their farms, the whole area of which is gene- 
rally from 3000 to 5000 morgen, or 6000 to 10,000 acres. 
Many years ago, the ostrich and other kinds of large 
game, such as the giraflfe, koodoo, gnu, blesbok, harte- 
beeste, &c., &c., were indigenous to that part of the 
country, but the influx of settlers, and the consequent 
erection of numerous villages and towns, caused the 
game to emigrate across the Great Orange Kiver, where 
they still continue to recede as the white man advances. 
" The ostrich is now being domesticated by a nomadic 
people, who are aware of the value of these birds. A 
full-grown male ostrich will yield about one pound of 
first-class feathers, of which it takes from ninety to one 
hundred to the pound, the value of which in Port Eliza- 
beth or Cape Town would be from £/\^2 to ;^50 per 
pound. The second-class feathers, which are neither so 
long nor so broad, and have not got the spotless purity 
of the first quality, realise from ;^20 to £2P P^^ pound. 
The small black tips from the back and breast are ex- 
ported chiefly for the regimental bonnets worn by High- 
land regiments, the plumes of hearses, and various other 
purposes of a less grave character, and are sold at 
nominal prices ; of course, all these are taken from birds 
that have been destroyed by native and other hunters, 
and some idea may be formed of the extent of this 
pursuit when I state, that some few years since, at the 



PIJiST REQUIREMENTS. igS 

village of Hope Town, almost bordering on tie present 
diamond fields, I saw offered for sale in one lot eight 
hundred weights of feathers that Lad just arrived from 
the interior, from Mr Moffat, a trader, the brother-in- 
law of Dr. Livingstone ; and at the present day it ia by 
no means uncommon to meet a wild untutored Kaffir or 
Hottentot Ijoy with three or four first-class feathers 
stuck jauntily througli his ears, or fastened in his woolly 
.head, of a length and beauty which would be calculated 
to excite the envy and admiration of many a European 
belle. But I am digressing. My reason for considering 
that ostrich-farming would prove a success in this 
country is the compact and secure manner in which 
the majority of the stations here are fenced in. It is 
an erroneous idea that, because the ostrich is a very- 
long-legged bird, it would require a very high fence 
to keep it in bounds. Such is not the ease ; the 
substantial wire-fencing that I have seen at most well- 
kept stations, is, in my opinion, quite high enough. 
An ostrich in motion does not rise upon the wing ; he 
skims, as it were, along the surface of tlie ground, and 
if he meets with any obstacle, such aa a fence, he will 
skirt along it, but never attempt to cross it, although 
he will cross a creek, the two hanks of which are nearly 
on a level with each other, by flying. The pace of an 
ostrich in full speed, going before the wind, with his 
feathers standing erect, is killing ; and I never saw the 
horse the rider of which could with truth say that he 
ran his game down fairly. The ostrich is a solitary 
bird, and of lonely, shy habits. Ostriches are never 
found in large troops like other game ; seldom more than 
six are seen together, and they run more frequently in 
pairs or singly. Their sense of smell ia very acute, as 



196 OSTRICH-FARMING, 

well as their sight, and their powers of digestion are 
truly astonishing. I have seen a tame one snatch a 
bunch of keys attached to a steel ring from a man, and 
swallow them with the greatest gusto, and I have given 
young birds, when about the size of turkeys, a few small 
nails (tacks) occasionally, which they seemed to relish 
amazingly, and would follow me about for more, so that it 
would appear essential for them (!). Sir Henry Barkly, 
in his letters, recommends an incubator ; but it appears 
to me that this method would not be required here, for 
this reason, if you have the birds to lay the eggs, why not 
let them finish their work ? This they most assuredly 
will do if left undisturbed to themselves. The process 
of hatching is performed by the male and female sitting 
alternately, one keeping a vigilant look out as sentry, 
as well as procuring food. The only reason that I can 
assign for the use of incubators in the eastern province 
districts at the Cape is from the fact of the almost 
universal system adopted by the Dutch Boers and the 
natives of robbing every nest that they find of all the 
eggs it contains, which are generally from eighteen to 
twenty-four in number. These are brought by the far- 
mers in their waggons when they come to the Nacht 
Maal or sacramental services, to such towns or villages 
as can boast of a Dutch church, where they exchange 
them in the stores for trifling necessaries. Their selling 
value in Africa is about sixpence each, and they find 
their way into the other parts of the colony amongst 
the farmers, who would then resort to artificial means 
of hatching them, and of so obtaining a troop of birds. 
This system of robbing the nests will rapidly cause them 
to be almost exterminated, and will prove a ^ievous 
loss to the colony, which it can ill afford. 



FIRST REQUIREMENTS. 197 

"Ostrich-farming will eventually prove remunerative 
in this country, and become more general as the birds 
increase in number. They should have a good ojien 
country, free from the shade of timber, and if the sod 
be sandy, or has sandy patches about it, so much the 
better, as it will be the more natural to them, and in 
those sandy places they will generally deposit their 
eggs. Before concluding, I may state that I examined 
some feathers from the Australian bii'ds that were offered 
for sale by Messrs. Gemmell, Tuckctt, & Co., some time 
ago, on account of the Acclimatisation Society, but not 
one presented the appearance of even second-claBS 
feathers, and yet they realised very high prices, that 
would astonish an African dealer. Subsequently, I saw 
some that were exhibited in a glass case at the Techno- 
logical Museum, and they aro much about the same 
quality. Why they should he curled artificially, and 
dyed, I am at a loss to imagine, as it destroys the 
natural drooping beauty of the feather, and as specimens 
for exhibition in a museum, they should have been left 
in their natural state. The eggs, also, are very much 
smaller than any I ever saw in Africa from birds in 
their native state. I fear that over-eagerness was dis- 
played in order to realise something from the imported 
birds, as the feathers appear to have been taken from 
them before they reached maturity ; and some tliat I 
noticed were so small, that to strip them from living 
birds was, if not cruel, unwise, as it was calculated to 
expose the creatures to chill and cold, which, if it did 
not prove fatal, was very likely to weaken the ensuing 
crop of feathers, not only in the length of shaft, but in 
one of the chief beauties of good feathers, its breadth. 



198 OSTRICH-FARMING. 

The average length of a really good feather is about two 
feet, and eight to nine inches wide. 

" In bringing these few remarks to a conclusion, I 
would merely recommend any society or individual 
desirous of importing ostriches to endeavour to procure 
them when they are about the size of a turkey-cock ; 
they will not then be so unwieldy or unmanageable as 
full-grown birds, and can be more readily provided for 
and protected on ship-board. By offering a small bonus 
to some of the ofl&cers there would be very little danger 
of their failing to come safely to hand." 

The best report on ostrich-farming with which we are 
acquainted is that which was prepared by Dr. W. G. 
Atherstone of Graham's Town, at the request of Sir 
Henry Barkly, for the Zoological and Acclimatisation 
Society of Victoria, and published in the "Proceedings " 
of that Society for 1874.^ 

This report, based as it is on observations made by 
Dr. Atherstone and some of his friends on different farms 
in the neighbourhood of Graham's Town, and containing 
as it does so much practical information, deserves to be 
read in extenso. 

" This new and important branch of industry," he 
says, " is beginning to attract considerable attention 
here, and deserves the serious consideration of all in- 
terested in the welfare of the colony. The export of 
feathers is rapidly increasing every year in quantity 
and value, not so much, I believe, from wild feathers, 
indicative of the progressive destruction of the ostrich, 
as from the increase of the domesticated birds and their

Magazine," and furnished material for the account of ostrich-farming which 
subsequently appeared in Silver's " Handbook for South Africa." 



DR. ATHERSTONES REPORT. 199 

more successful management, by which the feathers at 
one time considered vastly inferior to those of the bird 
in its wild state are now proved by market value to be 
equal if not superior in quality. I have myself seen, 
during the last eighteen months, upwards of five hundred 
domesticated ostriches in difierent districts of the colony 
in the eastern and western provinces, under varying 
conditions as to- soil, climate, and management, some in 
enclosures, some herded in large flocks like sheep, with- 
out enclosure or shelter of any kind, and fi'om my own 
observations and the inquiries I have made, I am of 
opinion that the success of ostrich -fanning, like that of 
sheep-farming, depends more upon the character of the 
veldt (or soil and grazing ground) and diet than upon 
climatic conditions. Exposure to wet and cold does not 
appear to be injurious to birds in full health and vigour, 
but it kills them if weak or out of condition. It is 
advisable, however, to protect them by shelter of some 
kind from the cold rains of winter in the domesticated 
state. The natural home of the ostrich and antelope is 
found in the ' karroo' plains and sweet-grass flats of the 
interior, and although, like the springbok, the ostrich 
occasionally resorts to the long sour grass of coast-lands, 
where perhaps the lime and salt replace the alkalies 
of the ' sweet grass ' and ' karroo', neither will thrive for 
any length of time on the ' strand veldt ' or the ' sour 
grass ' of the sandstone ranges, deficient in alkahes. 
Alkalies, in some form or other, seem to be necessary to 
the very existence of sheep, bucks, and ostriches ; and 
where these do not exist on the soil or plants, they 
must be supplied artificially to ensure the healthy con- 
dition of the animal, and the proper growth of the wool, 
hair, and feathers. It is for this reason that salt, ao 



200 OSTRICH FARMING, 

necessary for all domesticated animals, is in some parts of 
the Brazils said to be worth its weight in gold. I have 
heard of a house, the walls of which (made of brack 
ground) were nearly eaten through by a span of zuur- 
veldt oxen let loose on the reef. The attraction of the 
salt-licks or pans in the interior for game and stock is 
well known. This natural want may often be recognised 
at a glance on the surface of a farm. No bones are 
seen lying about on a zuur-veldt farm, all being greedily 
devoured by the stock ; cattle and sheep crush them up, 
and ostriches swallow them whole ; whereas on a sweet- 
veldt farm, whose soil and shrubs are rich in alkalies, the 
bones are untouched ; nothing requires them. There 
are three farms adjoining each other within a dozen 
miles of Graham's Town, on which upwards of 150 
ostriches are kept, which strikingly exemplify this fact, 
and this comparative adaptability of different soils and 
pasture for sheep, angoras, and ostriches. 

" Kruisfontein, on the south, belonging to my brother, 
John Atherstone, is an unmitigated zuur-veldt farm, 
situated on the sandstone range called the Zuurberg, 
which skirts Graham's Town on the south. There is no 
limestone on the farm. He has been at considerable 
expense in sheds, enclosures, and artificial feeding, and 
though successful at last, it has been only attained 
through dear-bought experience. Angoras do not suc- 
ceed, and, as a rule, wethers only thrive well; lambs are 
reared with difficulty, and ostriches require a large 
amount of artificial food, mealies and green crops, and 
require crushed bones, which they devour greedily. 
Until this place was adapted, the birds were in low con- 
dition, unhealthy, and the feathers inferior and inter- 
rupted in their growth. 



DR. ATHERSTONE'S REPORT. soi 

" Since the supply of bore-dust (he gives a quarter of a 
pound of sulphur to two buckets of crushed bones with 
salt), the improvement in the quality and value has been 
very marked, and the condition of the birds greatly 
improved. The yield and quality of the feathers appear 
to be directly proportionate to the health and vigour of 
the bird. Limestone, from the coast-land, was tried at 
first, as the birds would not lay ; it was broken up and 
scattered about, but the birds would not touch it. The 
phosphate of lime of the bones was the thing wanted, 
iind they rushed at the bones with avidity, and imme- 
diately began to improve in health and to lay. 

"Still, although he has had ostriches for nearly three 
years, and began with many full-grown birds, the 
attempts at incubation have been abortive from various 
causes, and he has had no increase. Of eighty-five birds 
originally placed on the farm in a 400-aere enclosure, 
he has lost twenty-seven — thirteen by cold and wet, 
three by diphtheria, six killed by natives, three by 
fighting, and two by falling into holes. He has five 
more males than females. Of sixty eggs, nineteen were 
destroyed by black crows, which were seen from the 
house to hover over the nest and let stones fall^ on 
the eggs (on running up on one occasion to the nest, 
about 600 yards off, he found three stones in the nest, 
the eggs cracked, and the yolk strewed about) ; forty- 
one were sent to the adjoining farm, Hilton, to be 
artificially incubated, but these failed, probably from 
having been shaken, although they were carried in 
baskets on the heads of native women, He has received

;^I450 for his feathers, plucking them every eight 
months, selecting the ripe feathers only, and plucking 
about sixty at a time. He finds it injures the bird and 
produces irritation-fever to pluck too many at once. 
His experience leads him to the opinion that the ostrich 
cannot stand exposure to wet or cold. This farm is 
rather higher (about 200 feet or 300 feet) than the other 
two, and therefore, perhaps, colder. 

" The next farm, Hilton, is like the table- farm adjoin- 
ing it, on the junction between the sandstones of the 
Lunberg and the schists and trap conglomerate forma- 
tion, mixed veldt, partly sour and partly sweet grass, 
the soil rich in alkalies, which often effervesce on the 
surface in the hollows. On Hilton, Mr. Arthur Douglas 
has now seventy-one birds, kept in an enclosure of 300 
acres, in good condition, and requiring very little artificial 
food. They lay well, and do not appear to suffer from 
exposure to wet or cold, although they have no shelter. 
He commenced about three years ago with eleven birds, 
he has now seventy one; he has successfully hatched 
seventy — forty artificially in the incubator. They have 
paired and hatched their young in the natural state, 
which has enabled him to watch them ; and he has thus 
acquired much valuable information regarding their 
habits and the natural mode of incubation. The male 
birds are very ferocious during the breeding season, and 
it is dangerous to approach them. Mr. Douglas^ has 
had several very narrow escapes. They sit alternately, 
the male at night grazing and guarding the female. 
During the daytime, the time of the male bird going 
on the nest varies during the period of incubation, as 
also does the time between the female leaving the nest 
and the male taking her place, the exposure and cooling 



DR. ATHERSrONE'S REPORT. 203 

being probably regulated by the temperature of the 
incubation fever at different stages. All these appa- 
rently trivial miuutiaD are yet matters of considerable 
importance in artificial incubation, and only to be 
acquired by patient watching and judicious application 
of the principles involved in machine-hatching. 

" ' Black Kloof,' which adjoins Hilton on the north-east, 
is on the trap conglomerate — a purely avveet-veldt farm, 
with many of the bitter and aromatic shrubs of the karoo. 
Here, Mr. George White, my brother-in-law, has twenty- 
three young ostriches in an enclosure of 500 acres 
thriving well, in good condition, and yielding feathers 
of excellent quality. As a rule, he gives no artificial 
food ; they thrive and fatten on the scanty scrub and 
sweet grass in the enclosure only. Last year, when he 
put several hundred sheep and goats into the.same enclo- 
sure, the birds were nearly starved, but they regained 
their condition as soon as the sheep were removed. 
They have no shelter of any kind, and have pot suffered 
at all from rain or cold. He began with seven — four 
males and three females, all chicks, their sex undistin- 
guishable from their plumage. He has had them six- 
teen months, and has not lost one. He plucks them 
twice a year. In rainy weather they do not even seek 
the slight shelter of the walls, but group themselves 
in the open ground, not appearing to care for cold or 
wet. The rocks, soil, and herbage contain alkalies in 
abundance, and the water is brackish, as the name of 
the farm implies. Sbeep and angoras and cattle thrive 
well, and no bones ai-e eaten by the stock ; they he 
scattered about everywhere. The contrast between the 
farms is very marked, and their comparative fitness for 
OBtrich-farming. Ostriches require, as a rule, I think, 



204 OSTRICH-FARMING. 

* sweet-veldt/ vaiiety of food, and a large extent of 
grazing ground to roam over, to keep them in health 
and vigour. 

"The Wimmera district, as I am informed by Mr. 
E. J. Dunn, geologist, who is intimately acquainted with 
the district, is ill adapted to the successful rearing of 
ostriches, although when reared they may thrive very 
well with artificial food. Mr. Dunn, who has lately 
travelled a good deal in our colony, and knows the 
peculiarity of our sweet and sour veldts, recommends 
the banks of the Loddon, near Baringhup, as better 
adapted for experimental ostrich-farming ; it is, he says, 
sweet veldt, and the high banks and rich flats along 
the river, and the high banks and stony ground above 
it, are more likely to suit the birds — the lucerne also 
growing luxuriantly there, which is one of the best 
green crops for ostriches. My brother gives two hundred 
pounds to three hundred pounds of lucerne daily to his 
birds, besides mealies or Indian-corn (one pound to each 
bird). With regard to plucking the feathers, which 
unfortunately are in prime condition at the period of 
incubation, when the plucking of them would interfere 
sadly with the birds, different opinions are entertained. 
Some pluck, some cut off* the feathers close to their 
insertion ; some separate some of the males from the 
females about the time of incubation, and then pluck 
them. My own opinion is, that the best plan is that 
adopted by a farmer in the western district, who had 
seventy or eighty ostriches, and found the plan the 
best and most convenient. To show me the process, 
he had the whole flock driven in, and we then insinuated 
ourselves by wriggling amongst the densely packed birds. 
He had previously shown me what to do in case of 



DR. ATHERSTONES REPORT. 105 

any bird proving vicious. They are perfectly in your 
power if you seize them by the neck; you may then 
choke them as far aa you please until you find them 
powerless, and you can then run away. Having got 
with my friend into the middle of the crowd, so packed 
that they were unable to move, he quietly selected two 
or three of the best feathers, and with a very sharp 
curved knife in his right hand, the blade protected by 
lying flat against his finger, he pressed it down as near 
the root as he eould, and cut it off obHquely upwards. 
The bird was quite unconscious of the operation, stand- 
ing perfectly still as he handed several to me ; he then 
picked out a blood feather, very beautiful, which on 
being cut bled a little, but the sharp knife separated 
it without it being felt. In a month or six weeks he 
took out all the stumps, if they had not already fallen 
out. By this means the health of the bird is not 
impaired, no irritation-fever is produced, as in the case 
of my brother's birds, and you can select the feathers 
that are in prime condition, leaving the others to ripen 
in due course. Still the process of incubation injures a 
great many valuable feathers, and it appears, therefore, 
clear to me that some mode of artificial incubation must 
be attempted to derive all the advantages possible from 
this new branch of industry, I therefore wrote to my 
son in London about three j-ears ago, early in 1869, 1 
think, requesting him to hunt up some incubator for hen's 
eggs, hoping by giving him the size of the egg, habits of 
ostrich, &c,, to be enabled to get a machine adapted for 
hatching ostriches. He sent me a letter in reply, and a 
prospectus from Mr. W. H. Thick, 1 88 "Wellington Eoad, 
Kentish Town, London, W.C., offering to construct one 
if 1 sent him all particulars. I bad great difficulty in 



J 



2o6 OSTRICH-FARMING. 

inducing any one to enter on the risk. My brother 
declined, preferring to wait till he saw if his birds would 
not breed in their natural state, and hatch their young. 
Not being a farmer myself, although perceiving at once 
the immense value of such an important aid to this 
second diamond-discovery, or rather gold-discovery, to the 
colony (for feathers were realising their weight in gold 
— ;^45 a pound, and single feathers 15s. to ;^i each, or 
about ;^6o), I could not myself carry out the idea. At 
last I persuaded Mr. Arthur Douglas of Hilton to send 
home an order for one of Mr. Thick's machines, which 
on the road from Port Elizabeth was unfortunately 
broken to pieces. However, by constructing another on 
the same principle, which was afterwards varied to suit 
the new phenomena that presented themselves during 
the experimental incubation ; and taking advantage of 
the practical lessons of the birds actually on the nest, 
testing their temperature, &c., Mr. Douglas has suc- 
ceeded in making a machine which has proved very 
efl&cient, though in many respects diflfering from the 
one originally imported. Several ostrich-farmers have 
had his improved incubator, and have been perfectly 
satisfied with their success. It is astonishing what 
slight causes will cause the failure of eggs, a thunder- 
storm has been known to destroy them, even the rough 
opening of the drawer containing the eggs will shake 
and injure them, and too great or too little heat proves 
fatal to the chicks. By this plan one male to three 
females is sufficient ; in a natural state of course there 
must be an equal number, as both sit alternately. I saw 
large herds of ostriches near Colesberg, 150 in a flock 
at least, herded by only two men on horseback with 
long whips on open flats. I presume mealies tempted

them to the homestead in the evening, where they re- 
mained on the 'reef until the next morning." 

A visit to Mr, Douglas's ostrich-farm at Hiiton is thus 
described by Mr. Hellier of Graham's Town : — 

" Hilton lies some twelve miles from Graham's Town, 
some two miles or less off to left or west of the Cradoek 
Road. The bouse stands in the middle of a lawn-like 
flat, which in England we should call a meadow, and in 
relation to the house, the ' home ground.' We were 
quite surprised to see such a building— three stories 
high, and quite a contrast to the usual farmhouses of 
the colony. To those who know the hospitalities of the 
country we need not detail what happened on our 
arrival. After hreakfaat we began on foot at first to 
make our round of the various ostrich flocks and troops, 
scattered or located as they are over a farm of some 3000 
morgen (6000 acres) ; and as we shall require the aid of the 
artificial memory afforded by the recollection of the way 
we went, we will tell our story in that order, beginning 
where we began with the first flock of this year's 
chickens we came to. The first chickens of this year 
were hatched in the early part of the mouth of August, 
and these, with others hatched during the following 
month or six weeks, now run together, and form a flock 
of forty-four fine, healthy, growing birds. Some of 
them are very large for tbeir age, and all are remark- 
ably lively, and in good conditiou. It was very amusing 
to see how they gathered round the coloured boy who 
looked after them. They ran away to him if startled 
in any way, and came eagerly at his call. 

"It was evident that their instincts had accepted him 
in the place of their original parents. These birds are 
now housed every night, and though this will no doubt 



2o8 OSTRICH-FARMING. 

be prudent for some time to come on account of storms, 
yet some of the oldest look quite able to take care of 
themselves. In fact, were they with their parent birds, 
they could not be gathered many of them under their 
wings, or otherwise much defended from the cold. This 
group of young birds are kept in the home field, and, 
we believe, occasionally get a little lucerne. The con- 
dition and health of this flock of birds is most satis- 
factory. It proves most triumphantly that ostriches 
hatched by machine, when the operation is properly 
conducted, are equally healthy with those that come 
into the world by the old-established and ordinary 
process ; and that the same set of conditions must 
have been complied with, and the various necessary 
manipulations which instinct teaches the old birds 
to perform, must have been successfully imitated in 
artificial incubation. We think Mr. Douglas told us 
he had lost but one since they were hatched, and this 
by accident. The next troop of this year's birds is a 
flock of sixteen. They looked to us about a month old. 
We were not told their age. These, too, looked exceed- 
ingly healthy. A boy was in attendance, and will con- 
tinue so a little longer, till they are strong enough to 
join their elder brothers and sisters. This little family 
is carefully housed every night in a warm covered stable. 
We forgot to say the older flock are put in a kind of 
kraal within the shed, into which they can run when it 
rains. By this plan they get gradually accustomed to 
sleep out at night. The next flock we saw was the 
baby flock of fourteen, some of which were only a day 
or two old, while some were a week or ten days ; for, 
as we shaU see when we come to speak of the * incuba- 
tor,' like some of our committees, there is power to add

to tlieir number. Theae were exceediDgly pretty little 
thiDgs, like giant young partridges, but with the special 
peculiarity of having little bristles all over them mixed 
with their down. They were very lively, and gathered 
round their guardian, and were some of them fed with 
a little cut lucerne. We were told that for the firat day 
or two after their birth they do not eat, but seem to bo 
looking about curiously upon the great world they have 
so strangely come into. Then, after two days, they 
begin to attend to the duties of life by setting up a 
mUl. This is precisely the fact. The little things, 
taught by instinct, eat no food till their gizzards are 
prepared, for which purpose they go about picking up 
little hard stones, of no doubt the exact kind required. 
After this preparatory process is completed they eat a 
little soft gi-een food. This infant flock is gathered into 
a warm room at night ; some of the youngest are put 
into the ' mother ' crib of the incubator, while others are 
accommodated with a lodging between blankets, or 
otherwise comfortably provided for. We find, \ij 
adding together the above flocks, we have some seventy- 
five chickens, all hatched since August by the incubator 
— all alive and well. 

" We next mounted our horses, and proceeded to an 
enclosure separated by the river from the home ground. 
In this enclosure we found fifteen fuil-grown birds, or 
mostly full grown, among -which were an old cock and 
two laying hens, and possibly a pullet, which Mr, 
Douglas told U3 he thought was just beginning to lay. 
The old cock was very savage and fightable, and was 
given some mealies (maize) to amuse him while we rode 
quietly by. The old fellow attacked his master while 
on horseback some little time ago. He succeeded in

getting his breast up to the horse, and kicked most 
furiously, but owing to the unusual position he had 
attained, his kicks went for nothing, except once, when 
his toe ripped open the skin of the horse's flank, which 
set the horse going in turn. The fact is, if the old birds 
only knew how to use their beaks as well as their feet, 
they would be most dangerous animals — as it is, though 
they peck off your hat, and pull your ears, their opera- 
tions in this way are nothing much. These fifteen birds 
have a large enclosure all to themselves. And here we 
may as well say that there are no sheep on the farm, 
and in the enclosures dedicated to the ostriches, except 
in the home field, there is no other kind of stock. 
We next, after a mile more or less, came to an en- 
closure in which were a very fine old cock and two 
laying hens. Here we were shown a nest, after due 
precaution having been taken to decoy the old monarch 
into a pen with some mealies, and safely shut him up ; 
but we must confess we gave one or two rather anxious 
looks towards the pen aforesaid, thinking it just possible 
he might get out of that and come and look after us. 
The two hens were both sitting down, which we were 
informed they do ; also, that when the one goes to lay, 
the other goes to keep her company, though we did not 
inquire whether that was the etiquette of ostrich Ufe — 
shall we say good breeding, or the special habits of these 
two birds. We were informed that the hens lay their 
eggs somewhere round about the nest, that is, within a 
few yards, and that the cock bird trundles them along, 
and places them in due order in the nest. In fact, the 
male ostrich seems the very antipodes of roosters and 
drakes, for he takes the chief solicitude about the future 
of the eggs, placing them in the nest, and always sittin<y

on them by night, with wardijig and divers other little 
attentions and performances necessary to a suecessful 
issue of incubation, which our good friend Mr, Douglas 
has carefully observed, after much patient watching, and 
duly made a note of. Here we saw a fine nest of eggs, 
and proceeded to count them, but were stopped with the 
information that they would never hatch. No I never; 
and why ? Simply that they were artificial ; and so 
good is the imitation, that they deceived not only 
novices like ourselves, but even the ostriches, who ought 
to have known better. 

" Out of the enclosure given up to the exclusive use 
of this polygamous family of three, we entered through a 
locked gate into a large enclosure or paddock, in which 
were fifty-eight one and two year old birds. They all 
looked exceedingly well, and though they did not dance, 
they seemed full of life. They do sometimes favour the 
spectators with a dance, and it is one of the funniest of 
all the freaks or habits of animals tliat evidence a sense 
of the jokeful we ever beheld. We once saw some 
twenty nearly full-grown birds waltzing together. Tliey 
began with a sort of sidling slow revolution on their 
toes, moving their wings gently up and down, and pre- 
sently they seemed to get into the spirit of the thing 
without the aid of any fiddler that we saw, and spun 
round at a rate that would have astonished any one but 
a dancing dervish. In dancing, they swept roimd and 
round without ever coming into contact with each 
other. Our fifty-eight young friends soon seemed anxi- 
ous to make our acquaintance, or perhaps more espe- 
cially to see if there were any mealies, and they came 
up all round us, some two or three at a time poking 
their little and long necks right into one's face. Quite 



2 1 2 OSTRICH-FARMIJ^G. 

docile and quiet, yet they seemed very inquisitive, and 
we should fully have expected, had we indulged in such 
vanities, to have seen our diamond breastpin disappear, 
as a specially valuable stone to furnish grinding power 
for the bird. It is a queer feeling to be in the middle 
and under the inspection of some fifty pair of eyes or 
more, with a good sharp bill between each pair that 
could easily appropriate — or say borrow — any little 
thing they take a fancy to. It was queer, but it was 
most satisfactory, for here were birds two years old, 
machine hatched, and in size, health, and quality every- 
thing that could be desired. 

" This completed our round of observation, in which 
we saw a good many contrivances for feeding, plucking, 
and general management, the result of much thought 
and patient investigation. Since the farm has had no 
sheep on it the veldt has very much improved, and 
no doubt is still progressing in the same satisfactory 
direction. 

*' We have spoken of various enclosures ; there must 
be at Hilton several miles of fencing completed ; and we 
saw another mile or more under operation. The diffi- 
culty in getting sneezewood posts has hindered the ope- 
ration ; but the fence is being put up with occasional 
sneezewood, the other more perishable posts to be sup'- 
plemented with sneeze when it can be procured. There 
is, in addition to the river running round it, in the body 
of the farm a good dam, from which the water is led by 
a syphon. 

" We saw the incubator, and in it forty-five eggs in 
the process of hatching. This operation is now per- 
formed almost to perfection, quite equal to anything the 
parent birds can do themselves, even supposing they are

unmolested, and escape all kinds of accidents to which 
they are exposed. Out of the forty-five eggs we saw, 
we may safely conclude forty-two would produce live 
and healthy chicka. The result now of several batches 
is for fourteen out of fifteen to be hatched. And Mr. 
Douglas seems pretty sanguine that he will ultimately 
hatch all the eggs placed in the incubatorj provided they 
are fertile. 

" The number of OBtricbea at Hilton is as follows : — 
Breeding birds — Males, 2 ; four hens and one pullet, 5 ; 
full-grown and nearly full-grown birds, 1 4 ; one-year 
and two-year old birds, 59; this year's chickens, 75; in 
all, 155. 

" And though we have every respect for the old pro- 
verb, yet, with the esperience aforesaid, we have every 
confidence in adding forty-two more for the eggs now in 
the machine, besides which, sojne of the hens are laying 
every day. They laid last year up to May, when they 
were permitted to hatch a small clutch of eggs them- 
selves, as it was thought they ought to have a rest — we 
mean a rest from laying. We must leave it to the ima- 
gination of our readers to add up the total amount of 
one year's produce from say seven birds — though it is 
only six in reality ^through the intervention of artificial 
incubators. And we think that he must be not only 
an imaginative man, but something else, who tries to 
carry on ostrich -farming without an incubator. One 
other fact, we think, is established, namely, that ostriches 
must have plenty of room."

thus incidentally alludes to the new industry of ostrich- 
farming :- 

"Pour r^l&ve des autruches comme pour toutes les 
autres branches de I'industrie, le progrfes s'est fait avec 
le temps, et les propri^taires commencent k comprendre 
qu'il est de leur int^rSt imm^diat de soigner ces animaux 
utiles et de les apprivoiser, afin de rendre plus facile la

essay^ Temploi de couveuses artificielles, et, sans se 
rebutter des nombreux t4tonnemens qui les attendaient, 
sont arrives k voir couronner leurs ejfforts d'un succ^s 
qui a ddpasse toutes leurs esperances." 

Although, where circumstances will permit, it is con- 
sidered better to hatch the young birds in the natural 
way, yet a considerable number are now reared by 
means of artificial incubators, and it has beeu found 
that not only can a larger percentage of eggs be saved 
in this way, but the young so hatched are no less 
healthy than if brought up by their parents.^ 

The apparatus devised and patented by Mr. Douglas, 
to which we have already alluded, and which has recently 
been exhibited by him at the Philadelphia Exhibition, is 
admirably adapted to the purpose required. It is so 
constructed that the eggs are brought into contact with

copper plates, which are heated by warm water to a proper 
temperature. Bj meaus of this incubator, he succeeded 
in rearing from sis ostriches {four hens and two cocks) one 
hundred and thirty young birds in one season. It la thus 
described by Mr. John Noble, clerk of the Cape House of 
Assembly, in his Handbook of the Cape Colony : — 

" The incubator consists ol' a wooden box, about three 
feet squai-e, open from above, and capable of containing 
twenty-five eggs. It rests upon a copper or zinc pan or 
cistern, three inches deep, and equal to the size of the 
box. This is filled with hot water, and lias four or five 
openings through which the vapour ascends into the 
box. The warm temperature of the water is maintained 
by a paraffin lamp kept burning underneath the pan ; 
but in some cases this has been found objectionable, aa 
the fumes of the lamp affect the young chicks as they 
leave the egg, and it is an improvement to have the 
lamp burning in an adjoining compartment, an exten- 
sion of the cistern or pan about a foot wide being carried 
through the partition or wall, and the lamp placed 
under it. The heat can be regulated as necessary, ther- 
mometers being constantly in use. The temperature of 
the box where the eggs are placed is 102° Pahr. when 
they are first put in ; after two weeks it is gradually 
reduced to 100°, and in two weeks more to 98°. The 
period of incubation is forty-two days. The eggs are 
turned and aired by opening the box and blanket cover- 
ing once or twice a day. A fortnight before the expira- 
tion of the time, they are held up against the light to' 
examine their condition, and a week after are slightly, 
but carefully, punctured near the top, with a sharp- 
pointed steel, to enable any of the chicks in weak con- 
dition the more readily to break the shell." 



OSTRICH-FARMING. 

Another form of incubator, of which we give a draw- 
ing, is the deBign of a young engineer employed at the 
Accljmatiaation Gardens at Algiers, who has made arti- 
ficial incubation his special study. A model of this 
machine was exhibited in the Cape Department at the 
Vienna Exhibition. The mode of xising it may be thus 
described : — The incubator is placed on a wooden ground- 
floor, and covered with a woollen blanket. The room must 
be well aired, clean, dry, and quiet, away from the stable 




and the kitchen. There must be no offensive smell, no 
cats — and persons approaching must not smoke. In 
winter the room must be kept warm ; its temperature 
must not descend below 55° Fabr. The cistern of the 
incubator must be quite full, but not overflowing. Two 
gallons of boiling water must be kept in readiness to 
keep up the requisite heat in the cistern. When you 
commence, fill the cistern with hot water, 190°; let it cool 
down to 118°; leave the thermometer in the drawer; 
ascertain after a time whether the temperature in the 
drawer is 105° before you put in the eggs; keep it from 
104° to 105° during the first twenty-three days, and 



ARTIFICIAL INCUBATORS. 



then lower it to 102° : 104' is the natural heat of the 
ostrich mother. Ascertain every three hours that it is 
maintained ; warmer it must not be. Each drawer is 
constructed to hold aix eggs, which must be fresh laid, 
cleaned, and secured with clean cotton, so that they do 
not roll about, nor touch one another. During the 
first twenty-three days the eggs must reach the top line, 
as marked in the drawer, not beyond ; the following 
twelve days to the second line ; and for the remainder of 
the time imtil they are hatched to the third and lowest 



\

line. The necessary wooden divisions are in the drawer. 
The space between the line is three-eighths of an inch. 
For ten or fifteen minutes, according to the season, 
every morning and evening, the eggs should be aired 
and turned, so that the part which faced the cistern in 
the daytime cools at night, and vice- vetsd. They will 
be hatched in from forty-five to fifty days. The young 
bird will pierce the shell itself, and need not be assisted. 
As soon as they are out of the shell they should be kept 
in a basket, in some clean, dry, wann stuff (chenille or 
cotton wool), for twenty-four hours, but sufficiently ex-

posed to the air to admit of their breathing freely. A 
good plan is to construct a coop, aa shown in the engrav- 
ing below, from the roof of whinh is hung a lot of warm 
chenille. Into this the young birds creep and nestle, 
and it acta the part of an artificial mother. They should 
be fed at fii-st on bread crumbs, bran, and water. On 
the fourth day a little enclosure may be made round 
the incubator, and the young birds may be allowed out 
during the day. They may then have grain, bread, 
greeu vegetables, and water. At night they ahould he 
taken under shelter as a precautionary measure, and in 




each enclosure there should be a shed in which they can 
take refuge by day in the event of a storm. Great 
mortality prevails from the day of birth until they 
are about three months old, after which time the chief 
danger ia over. But although few die after that age, a 
good many break their legs, in which case they generally 
have to be killed. Ostriches are not expensive to keep, 
for during the greater portiou of the year they can find 
enough to live upon in their enclosures, and at other 



FOOD FOR YOUNG BIRDS. 219 

times only require a little Indian-corn or beans, and 

some additional green food in the shape of lucerne, all 
which can be grown on the farm. 

In Algeria Captain Crdpu found that the birds throve 
well on barley, fresh grass, cabbage, and the leaves of 
the cactus or Barbary fig chopped fine. He recommends 
about three pounds avoirdupois of barley a day for each 
bird, and green food according to circumstances. In 
winter, and during the breeding season, a more plentiful 
supply than usual should be given. 

Mr. Kinnear states that for their usual food nothing 
equals lucerne or trefoil, but they also like cabbage 
leaves, fruit, and grain. Maize or Indian-corn, better 
known in the Colony as " mealies," they are very fond of. 

Aa is the case with cattle, the nature of the soil and 
the climate must be carefully studied if ostrich-farming 
is to be cai'ried out successfully. The birds wiU, of 
course, live, and to a certain extent thrive, on grass or 
sour veldt, but they do much better on the "karoo." 
Here tbey find and take into their system the natural 
alkalies which are so beneficial to their health, as well 
as the fruit and berries of various wild shrubs and 
plants, which, with grass and leaves, form their chief 
food when in a wild state. Under these conditions the 
birds grow well and strongly, and the feathers get finer, 
heavier, and more valuable. 

The largest and longest feathers of commerce are those 
from South Africa, but being less flexible than those 
from Barbary and Aleppo, they rank after them in point 
of value. M. Jules Verreaux saw one from the Cape 
which measured over two feet in length, and was seven 
inches wide. 

In 1826 ostrich feathers irom the Cape paid a duty in 




220 



OSTRICH-FARMING. 



England of 20s. per pound. In 1832 this was reduced 
to los., and in 1845 the duty was wholly repealed. 

In 1846 only 1327 pounds of feathers, of the esti- 
mated value of ;^8ooo, wer^ exported from the Cape, 
and these were feathers obtained from wild birds that 
had been shot or hunted down. Since that date the 
export, both as regards quantity and value, has increased 
enormously, and this, of course, has been especially the 
case since ostrich-farming came into vogue. 

Some idea of this large increase may be found on 
glancing at the figures in the following table, compiled 
from the returns of the Board of Trade : —

pound of the feathers, which it is difficult to explain 
without details of the quality, of the state of the mar- 
kets, of the season, and other points. That increased 
production has been followed by diminished prices does 
not appear to be the case absolutely, though to a certain 
extent this natural sequence of events may have occurred. 
A reduced price, occurring contemporaneously with 
largely increased yield, is most apparent on the return 
for 1870, as compared with that for 1862, the value 
per pound being ^a'gg in 1870 against £s"] in 1862. 

This may be accounted for by the fact of the increased 
yield of feathers, under the artificial system of producing 
them, having so suddenly followed upon a period of 
scarcity, as to have alarmed the merchants, who feared 
a general depreciation of the prices. The subsequent 
rally in prices is sufficient to prove the healthy tone of 
the market, and the prosperity of the trade, for we find 
that, after the large crop in 1870, which succeeded a 
comparatively poor period of production, and which has 
been followed by an annuaUy increasing yield, prices, 
instead of falling, rose to an average of 50 per cent, 
higher per pound than Lad been maintained in the years 
immediately preceding. The average value per pound 
previous to 1870 was ;^3'8. Since then it has been

222 OSTRICH FARMING, 

Incredible as it may seem, an ostrich-feather mer- 
chant can, at a glance, distinguish from what locality 
the feather has come. There is as much difference in 
the feathers from Egypt, Tripoli, the Cape, Morocco, and 
Senegal, as there is in the various qualities of coffee and 
sugar, and the initiated perceive it at once and utilise 
their knowledge accordingly. The Barbary feathers 
are considered the most superior in fulness, breadth, 
colour, and gracefulness; they are consequently the 
most expensive. They are shipped from Tripoli viA 
Marseilles to Paris, but sometimes also vid Malta to Leg- 
horn, where they are sorted and classified in bundles, and 
are thence forwarded to Paris and London. They are 
generally counted, not weighed, and rarely or never find 
their way to the public sales in London, being usually sold 
by private contract. The feathers from Egypt comprise 
those which are brought to Cairo from the various coun- 
tries east and south of Egj^t, from Arabia, and from 
the Upper Nile and the Desert. Those from the interior 
are brought by caravans to Cairo, and there they are 
" made up " for the European markets, that is to say, 
they are classed in different qualities and colours, and 
the bundles tied up with thick twine-rope or strips of 
leather, and sold by weight. This unfortunately leads 
to much deception ; for in some cases, when unpacked, 
the bundle which is supposed to consist of icx) lbs. of 
feathers is found to contain 75 per cent, of rubbish. 
By far the largest quantity is sent vi6, Marseilles to 
Paris ; about one-tenth possibly finding its way to 
Southampton and London. In the monthly public sales 
of the metropolis, the quantity of " roped" feathers from 
Egypt, as compared with those from the Cape, is inconsi- 
derable, and is looked upon with suspicion as being un- 



EXPORTATION OF FEATHERS. 223 

fairly pncked. In quality, the Egyptian feathers, except- 
ing such as come from Arabia, are considered next to 
those from Barbary, although when bleached they are 
inferior in colour. Large quantities of so-called " tame " 
feathers come from Egypt. (See Appendix, Report 
from Egypt.) The next in quality are those from 
Mogador, which may be said to be about on a par 
in point of value with those from South Africa. 
They come from the kingdom of Morocco, and are 
mostly shipped from Mogador by steamer to London, 
where some of them occasionally find their way to the 
London public sales ; but most of them are shipped to 
the order of London and Paris dealers. The feathers 
from Senegal are forwarded to Bordeaux, but some are 
shipped by the West Coast line of steamers to Liverpool, 
chiefly for French account. 

The Cape feather ranks next to the Egyptian for quan- 
tity, although not for quality or graceful shape ; it is 
superior however as regards colour, and bleaches to 
a more perfect white. With the exception of a small 
quantity shipped direct to Europe and the United 
States, they come direct to London by the Union and 
Colonial mail steamers, partly to the order of dealers, 
and partly by way of consignment, in which latter case 
they are sold at the monthly public sales in Mincing 
Lane. Dealers draw a distinction between Western and 
Eastern Cape feathers ; the former being considered of 
richer plumage than the latter. Western feathers come 
from Damara-land (Walvisch Bay) and Namaqua-land 
(Port Nolloth) to Cape Town, where a smaller quantity 
from tho different districts of the Western Provinces 
is also sent. Eastern feathers are forwarded to Port 
Elizabeth, Algoa Bay, and include small shipments 



224 OSTRICH'FARMING. 

from Natal. They comprise the booty of all the coun- 
tries of South Africa south of the Eiver Zambesi, from 
the Transvaal Republic, the Orange Free State, and 
the immense tracts of lands beyond their borders in 
the interior, north and west, belonging as yet to no 
European power. They arrivB sorted in the different 
qualities and colours, are consigned to Port Elizabeth 
merchants, and are sold by weight in the market by 
public sale or by private contract. None of the steamers 
running up and down the East Coast of Africa from the 
most northern port to Natal, and touching at Zanzibar, 
Mozambique, Quilimane, and Delagoa Bay, ever bring 
ostrich feathers. Nor do any of the boats plying on the 
west coast, from Senegal in the north to the most 
southern Portugese possession, so far as we are aware, 
carry them either. 

The various qualities of feathers may thus be classified, 
according to the localities whence they are brought, com- 
mencing with the finest from Aleppo : — 

A. Aleppo, from the Syrian desert ; the most perfect in plumage, 

breadth, grace, and colour, but very rare. 

B. Barbary, from Tripoli 

C. St Louis, from SenegaL 

D. Egypt; these do not bleach to the best white. 

E. Mogador, from Morocco. 

F. Cape ; although as perfect in colour as those of Aleppo, they are 

much inferior in quality. 

G. Yamani, from Arabia — commonly but erroneously designated 

" Senegal : " the most inferior in plumage, being thin and 
poor. 

The difierence between a feather from a wild and 
one from a tame bird is immediately perceptible to 
the connoisseur. The so-called "tame feather" is 
much stifier, has not the natural graceful fall of the

wild feather, has "galleries" in the quill, and even 
when dressed and curled, becomes stiff again after a 
time. Having a thin cut quill, alao, it is lighter than 
the wild one. One hundred and twenty best white 
tame feathers weigh one pound or thereabouts. The 
same number of the finest white wild " blood-feathers " 
weigh a pound, but in point of "value they are worth 
more than double. Should the quantity of tame white 
feathers become trebled or even quadrupled within the 
next five years, they will still remain a staple article of 
commerce, and wiU not become, as some have predicted, 
"a drug in the market." This large increase in quantity, 
however, wiU naturally influence the value to a con- 
siderable extent. The total annual value of ostrich 
feathers at present exported from Africa (see Appendix)

ARTIFICIAL BLEACHING. 

The value of a black or grey ostricli feather, as com- 
pared with a white one of the same size and texture, 
may be taken, at a rough estimate, to be one fourth or 
fifth. Formerly light colours, such as sky-blue, pink, straw, 
&c., could only be produced by dyeing white feathers. 
But in the year 187 1, Messrs. Viol, Duflot, & Boetzel, 
feather manufacturers and dyers, of Paris, discovered a 
chemical process by which they extracted the natural 
black or grey colour of the ostrich feather, without in- 
juring the duvet or plumage, bleaching the feather a 
dirty white, suiBScient, however, to dye the lightest pink 
or sky-blue upon an originally dark-grey feather, the 
quill only remaining darkish, so that the connoisseur 
can still distinguish the difierence. For this inven- 
tion Messrs. Viol took out a patent in Great Britain, 



COUNTRIES ADAPTED FOR IT. az? 

France, Germany, and the United States. Endless law- 
suits ensued in the various countries. The patentees 
appealed, and although they ultinaately succeeded in 
France, they lost their case in Great Britain and Ger- 
many. The consequence has been, that the various 
ostrich feather manufacturers in France — and there are 
several hundreds in Paris — have to apply to Messrs. 
Viol for bleached feathers, whilst the English, German, 
and American manufacturers are free to adopt the pro- 
cess without restraint, 

COUNTRIES ADAPTED FOR OSTRICH- FARMING. 

From the examples already given of Buecessful accli- 
matisation out of Africa, it is evident that ostrich- 
farming may be pursued with success elsewhere than in 
the bird's native land. Countries and colonies in tem- 
perate latitudes, having dry barren waste lands, afford 
facilities in this respect to those who are sufficiently 
enterprising to import male and female birds. The 
southern provinces of Russia, Portugal, Spain, Italy, 
and Greece, AVestem Australia, New South Wales, and 
Queensland, Persia, the Ottoman Empire, and the 
northern parts of British India, the Brazils, and some 
parts of South America and of the Southern United 
States, offer to a great extent many of the conditions 
whieii experience has shown to be requisite for breeding 
and successfully domesticating this giant bird. 



REPORT FROM SOUTH AUSTRALIA, WIMMERA DISTRICT,

Society of Victoria, lias not, up to the present time. 



228 OSTRICH'FARMING. 

proved very successful ; but whether caused by want 
of knowledge of the habits of the species, and of the 
best mode of management, or whether the climate be 
unsuitable, yet remains to be proved. The first impor- 
tation of birds, five in number, not being found to in- 
crease at the Eoyal Park, it was determined by the 
Council of the Acclimatisation Society to send them to 
the Wimmera, which was considered a more suitable 
climate than that of Melbourne ; and there they were 
placed under the care of Mr. Samuel Wilson. With the 
limited information which he could gather as to the 
best mode of management, he endeavoured, with some 
success, to increase their numbers, and obtained from 
them at various times a quantity of very good feathers. 
In 1873 he reported to the Society as follows:^ — 
" Of the original importation, two were males and three 
females; of the females, one proved barren. The first 
summer two of the females had nests. These were 
simply a natural hollow in the ground, trampled into a 
saucer-shaped nest about six feet in diameter. There 
was no attempt made to collect grass or any kind of 
rubbish to line the nest with. One of them was on 
hard clay soil, and had about ten eggs in it ; the other 
contained thirteen eggs. Unfortunately, heavy rains 
came and flooded the nest which was on clay soil, and, 
although the water soon disappeared, the eggs were 
afterwards found to be addled. Out of the other nest 
twelve young ostriches were hatched, which were care- 
fully attended to by the parent bird, and all of which 
lived and grew to a large size. The ostrich, contrary to 
the received opinion, hatches its eggs by sitting on

toria," vol. ii. p. 205 (1873). 



REPORT FROM A VSTRALIA. aag 

them, in the same way as most other birds. Both are 
seldom absent from the nest at any time ; the male sits 
even more closely than the female, and takes rather more 
than his share of the parental duties. "While the egga 
are being deposited in the nest, and during incubation, 
he is exceedingly pugnacious, and an enraged male 
ostrich is about as formidable-looking an animal as one 
^\'ou!d care to meet. The second year only one nest 
was made, and the selection of the place was so 
unfavourable, that rain filled the nest and spoiled the 
eggs, preventing increase for that year. Various acci- 
dents occurred to the birds, causing losses. One got 
killed by running against a fence when an attempt was 
made to drive them into a yard ; one died from rheu- 
matism, and several from cold in winter. In the third 
season two nests were made, and a number of birds 
were hatched in one of them, but they all disappeared, 
and were found with their heads eaten off: it was sup- 
posed that native cats had killed them. During the 
summer just ended {1872) two nests were made, and a 
number of birds were hatched, which were taken away 
from their parents, housed, and fed, and of these only 
three are now alive. Of two sent to the Royal Park of 
this year's birds, one died from rheumatism. One of 
the old birds got hurt in a wire fence, and died; one 
strayed away, and was supposed to have been killed for 
the feathers: a reward of ^^lo was offered unsuccess- 
fully for such information as would lead to the offender 
being punished. The number now left is fourteen in 
aU, including one at the Royal Park ; only one of the 
originally imported birds being left.

" The taking of the feathers," he adds, " is rather hard

work. To effect this object, I had a strong yard made, 
with a smaller one leading out of it to a narrow lane or 
crush-pen. The ostriches were accustomed to the large 
yard by being fed in it every day. When wanted, they 
were diiven into the crush and the gates closed. On 
one occasion, after trying for a great part of a day to 
drive them from the yard into the crush-pen without 
success, and being about to give it up, a little terrier 
happened to come into the yard, and immediately the 
birds ran into the pen in the greatest alarna. The 
plucking is done from a platform outside the pen, on 
which the operator stands. The wing is caught by one 
hand and the ripe feathers pulled by the other. A man 
assists by keeping the bird up to the place where it is 
wanted, and preventing its turning. They never attempt 
to peck with their beak, and the long snake-like neck 
winds under the arms and round the neck of the ope- 
rator in a somewhat alarming way while the work is 
going on. It is very rough work to handle them, and 
bruised hands, arms, and fingers, are generally exhibited 
after a day's ostrich-plucking. As only a few feathers 
are taken from each, the bird does not suffer much from 
cold in consequence. 

" The only feathers of any great value are the large 
feathers of the wing, of which there are about twelve in 
each. These should be taken before they are quite 
matured, or the delicate plumage gets worn and scanty J 
if too soon taken, they are not fully developed, and are 
of less value. Their growth should be watched, so as to 
get them at their best, but I could not manage this well, 
as the birds, from not being fed regularly, got too wild, 
and could not be got into the yard except after a 
month's feeding, and some of them have seldom or

never been plucked, and cannot be got to enter the 
yard. 



" The feathers from the oatrichea on the Wimmera," 
says Mr.Wilson, " have been sold for high prices at various 
times, and large numbers have been obtained and for- 
warded to the Council of the Acclimatisation Society; 
but the greater part of them have, I regret to say, been 
of little value from being left too long on the bii"ds, 
owing to the great difficulty of getting them decoyed 
into the yard. The pugnacious habits of the bird 
render its complete domestication a matter of some risk 
and of considerable difficulty. I would recommend that 
some of the selectors be encouraged to attempt ostrich- 
farmiDg, and with this object a few might be sold at 
a moderate price. Their personal eai-e and attention 
would probably lead to a more complete domestication 
of the bird than has been possible under my care." 

]VIr. Wilson thus concludes ; — " I cannot say that I 
am very sanguine as to ostrich-culture proving a suc- 
cessful or remunerative pursuit. There is, however, little 
difficulty in keeping these birds within enclosures, as a 
-two-rail fence will generally prove sufficient to prevent 
their straying ; their pugnacious habits, and the diffi- 
cidty of guarding them when required, are the great 
obstacles to their successful management With care, 
no doubt, these obstacles can be lessened or overcome. 
If the bird could be established in the interior of the 
continent, I have no doubt that it would increase 
rapidly, and become as numerous as it is iu those parts 
of Africa where it is found in a wild state. Many parts 
of the interior would, I think, be better suited to this 
bird than Longerenong. Probably the sandy heaths of 



232 OSTRICH-FARMING. 

the Lower Wimmera around Lake Hindmarsh, or the 
arid plains on the Darling or Cooper's Creek, where 
the emu abounds, would be found mora like its native 
haunts, and better suited to the habits of the bird.*' 

IMPROVEMENT OF STOCK. 

On glancing at the table given on page 224, it will 
be seen that, as regards quality, ostrich feathers from 
the Cape stand sixth on the class list, their plumage 
being thinner and poorer than that of the five sorts, 
which take precedence. 

It occurred to the writer that possibly some improve- 
ment might be eflfected by crossing Cape birds with 
fresh stock from North Africa, and on making this sug- 
gestion to M. Geoflfroy St. Hilaire, a great authority in 
such matters, he replied that it was quite feasible, and 
that although in all probability the progeny from such 
a cross would be smaller in size than the South African 
ostrich, their plumage, he believed, would be superior. 

Anxious to put the experiment to the test, the writer 
accordingly shipped two pair of first-class Barbary birds 
from Tripoli to Marseilles, and from thence viA London 
to the Cape, where they arrived safely in May last. 
Time will show the value of the experiment, which, it is 
confidently expected, will be worth repeating. 




CONSULAR AND OTHER REPORTS. 



EGYPT. 

In the absence of Major-Glenenil Stanton, C.B., Her Majesty's Conaiil- 
CJeneral at Alexandria, Mr. Charles A. Cookson, in reply to our in- 
quiries on the subject of the ostrich-feather trade in Egypt, was good 
enough to inform us, by letter dated 17th July 1875, that the annual 
value of ostrich feathers exported from Egypt is from £160,000 to 
X300,000| varying according to the European demand, which again 
is dependent on the fluctuations of fashion. The feathers are brought 
to Cabo (the only Egyptian market for them) by merchants from 
the Soudan, Kordofuii, Darfour, and Wadai, and are with difficulty 
conveyed thence by camels to the Nile. He added that no ostrich 
feathers come to Egypt from Abyssinia. 

M. Eugene Gros, a merchant at Cairo and Paris, for many years 
connected with the ostrich- feather trade of Egypt, writing from 
Cairo on the 20th October 1875, states that the annual value of the 
ostrich-feather trade there is rather difficult to estimate, but may 
be taken at from two to three hundred thousand pounds. He con- 
firms the consular report that the feathers come from Kordofan, 
Gezird, Darfour, Baghirmi, Wadai, and the country of Somali, 
A certain quantity is also received from Arabia. They are brought 
from the far inland desert by camels to the Nile, and then come up 
the river in barges. There is no law of any kind here to limit or 
control the destruction of ostriches ; moreover, the desert countries 
where these birds are shot are not under Egyptian dominion. At 
Kordofan the Arabs domesticate the ostrich, and there are many 
ostrich-farms there belonging to the natives. All the eggs, however, 
are hatched by female ostriches, and the use of incubators is unknown. 



234 APPENDIX. 

Erery six months the feathers are palled out of these tame birdSy 
which, after beiog completely placked, have their skins rubbed over 
with oiire oil, to alleviate the irritation which natorallj ensues firom 
the operation. The great quantity of short drab feathers which are 
annually exported from Egypt come from these tame female ostricheSy 
which, to meet the large demand made upon them, are plucked com- 
pletely bare. It is not possible to state the exact number of tame 
ostriches in Egypt, because no reliable statistics exist on this head. 
In the Soudan only — namely, in Kartoum, Kordofiui, and Darfour — 
the inhabitants have taken largely to ostrich-farming, which appears 
to pay them welL The relative quantity of tame feathers, com- 
pared with the wild, cannot be determined either, for the simple 
reason that both qualities are systematically mixed together before 
they reach Cairo. From a religious scruple, the Mussulman is averse 
to the mode of plucking the feathers out of the live bird. He con* 
siders it an act of cruelty, and rather prefers to kill the bird. This, 
of course, tends very much to check the spread of ostrich-farming in 
Egypt and the adjacent Mohammedan countriea The more humane 
method of cutting off the feathers close to the skin, and allowing the 
roots of the quills to fall out by degrees, seems to be unknown in 
Egypt. The feathers from Arabia come from T^m^ni, a country 
situated on the southern borders of Arabia and the Red Sea, and 
extending from Asia to the Gulf of Aden. Formerly, caravans from 
Arabia brought feathers to Aleppo, but since the steamers have 
commenced running to all the Arabian ports, that route has been 
completely abandoned. 

M. F. Goy, one of the principal ostrich-feather merchants in Paris, 
and for more than thirty years well acquainted with the details of 
the North African feather trade, has kindly furnished us with the 
following additional particulars : — 

The value of ostrich feathers annually exported from Egypt may 
be estimated at £250,000, being the average of the last five years, 
taking into consideration the enhanced value of the article during 
that period. Cairo is the market for the Egyptian feather trade, 
and Alexandria the port from whence they are shipped. 

The various qualities of feathers which are sold at Cairo come 
from the African countries south of Egypt, and also from Arabia. 
The former, however, form by far the most important portion, and 
are of two qualities, according to their origin — those from Senaar^ and 
those from Kordofan. 



APPENDIX. 335 

The former are of tliiuk plumage, dry and brilliant, wLilst the 
latter resemble more the graceful Barbary feather in the colour and 
quality of the plumage. Feathers coming from the neighbour- 
hood of Wadai are often taken for those coming from Kordofan, 
and being sent towards the west, find their way into the Barbary 
markets, while those from Darfour frequently follow the same route, 
and are mixed with consignments from Senaar. 

At Kartoum, beyond the sixth cataract of the Jiile, entire skina 
are brought in by the caravans from the desert, and are sold and 
picked, and then forwarded by the native traders. They are fre- 
quently sent as far as Bongolah up the Nile, and from there to 
Assouan, to Siout, and finally to Cairo. At each of these stations 
exchange and barter takes place, and the feathers often changing 
hands many times before they finally reach the European buyer at 
Cairo. In the meantime, they have been classed and re-classed, sorted 
and re-sorted, for the purpose of deceiving the buyer as to the real 
contents and quality of the bundles. These fraudulently-packed 
parcels are chiefly made up at Siout ; and so cleverly is this done, 
that the inexperienced buyer Is often completely victimised. 

The feathers from Kordofan, however, sometimes arrive by the 
caravans from Gellabs, which come direct to the gates of Cairo, 
without the intervention of the Assioutains. Hitherto all feathers 
from Kordofan have been procured from wild birds, shot in the 
desert; but those from Senaar, which, as regards quantity, consti- 
tute about two-thirds of all the Egyptian feathers, are mixed with 
those from domesticated birds, in the proportion of a quarter 
"wild," to three-quarters " tame." The details of ostrich-farming 
as practised by the natives of Nubia are as yet almost unknown ; 
but to judge by results, it is evident that the system there adopted 
does not approach that of the Cape colonists by a long way. The 
characteristic blemishes in the "tame" feathers, as compared with 
" wild," are consequently much more apparent in those from Egypt 
than in those from the Cape. Nevertheless, the better quality of 
the plumage renders the former superior to the latter, 

Arabia formerly furnished three different qualities of ostrich 
feathers : The " Aleppo," from wild ostriches in the desert of Syria, 
the moat perfect of all in grace, colour, and richness of plumage ; 
the " Hedjiaz," which from their form were called " false Aleppo ; " 
and the "YSmen," easily recognisable by their splendid white colour 
and the poverty of their plumage. 



236 APPENDIX. 

The two first named have become so scarce that they now hardly 
form an article of trade, while the last named are so inferior in 
quality that they are difficult to dispose of. The three Arabian 
qualities are sometimes mixed together by the Arabs, and sent to 
Cairo by way of Djeddah, and small quantities are occasionally ship- 
ped direct to Europe vi4 Aden, but their value is insignificant com- 
pared with the quantities forwarded to Cairo. There is no place in 
or near Abyssinia from whence feathers are sent^ and, so far as can 
be ascertained, none are brought from that country. The feathers 
from Alexandria are shipped by steamers direct either to Mar- 
seilles or to Southampton. 



BARBARY. 

To the courtesy of Mr. F. R Drummond Hay, H.M. Consul- 
General at Tripoli, we are indebted for the following communica- 
tion, dated Tripoli, i8th August 1875 • — 

** Ostrich feathers are brought to market at this port from Tim- 
buctoo, Housa, Bomou, and Wadai ; those from Timbuctoo being 
considered the finest. The feathers from the three former regions 
are brought to Ghadames, by the agents of Ghadamseen merchants, 
and thence to Tripoli by the merchants themselves. Those from 
Wadai are brought here viA Fezzan, and sometimes Bengazi, by 
Tripoli traders. 

" The total annual value of ostrich feathers exported from Tripoli 
is about ;^i 00,000, and they are shipped chiefly for Loudon and 
Paris. Those from Housa are brought here to Tripoli and sold 
by the skin, then plucked and sorted into bundles, according to 
quality, by the exporters. Feathers from other parts of the interior 
are generally brought down and sold in bulk, and sorted before 
exportation. No feathers from tame birds are exported from Tri- 
poli, nor are any exported from Tunis. The Ghadamseen mer- 
chants, who monopolise nearly the whole of the feather trade of the 
surrounding regions, prefer Tripoli as a market for their goods, as 
being much nearer to Ghadames than Tunis, whilst at the same time 
the route is safer. It would not be difficult to obtain live ostriches 
from the interior for exportation to Europe or elsewhere for the 
purposes of acclimatisation." 



ALGERIA, 

Lieutenant-Colonel Playfair, H.M. Consul-Gen era! at Algiers, 
writing to U3 under date lith July 1875, has most obligingly re- 
ported aa follows : — " Ostriches were once very common in Algeria, 
The early travellers, about the middle and end of the last century, 
used to hunt them, even north of Batna, in the high plateaux ; but 
at the time of the French conquest they wore confined to the Sahara, 
though very plentiful there. General Marguerite, the prince of 
Algerian hunters, who was killed at Sedan, did more perhaps than 
any one else to cause their extinction. He, and all the French 
ofScers stationed in the Sahara, hunted thetn to such an extent, that 
now they have ceased to exist in French Algeria. A few feathers 
are occasionally brought from the remote oases in the desert, such as 
EI-G0I63, Insallah, ic, but they are very few indeed, and even these 
are brought rather as presents to the French military command- 
ants, than for sale. Ostrich eggs are much sought after to make 
fancy articles for the Enghsh tourists who come here in winter. 
They are brought in by the Arabs from great distances ; but their 
number is decreasing yearly, and the price is augmenting. There 
are districts in the far interior where the bird still exists, but 
where chasseurs are few ; and hence the eggs only are brought in." 

To the foregoing particulars we may add, that an English lady, 
the wife of a French advocate at Algiers, has lately commenced 
ostrich-farming in the vicinity of the town; and a French officer, 
Commander Cr^pu, at Daja, in the province of Oran, has likewise 
turned his attention to the subject with some success. 



MOGADOE. 



His Excellency Sir John Hay Dmmmond Hay, K.C.B., H.M, 
Plenipotentiary at Tangiers, courteously replying to our application 
for information concerning the ostrich- feather trade of Morocco, 
wrote in September 1875 as follows; — -"As ostrich feathers are 
not exported from Tangiers, being the northern port of Morocco, 
I have sent your letter to my son, who is H.M. Consul at Morocco, 
whence ostrich feathers are exported, and I have requested him 



238 APPENDIX, 

to reply to the queries you have put me, and to lose no time in 
transmitting to you the required information." 

In due course we received from Mr. R. Drummond Hay, H.M. 
Consul at Mogador, the following report, dated 15 th September 
1875 :- 

" I have much pleasure in furnishing the information required 
respecting the ostrich-feather trade between this country and the 
Soudan. 

" The annual value of ostrich feathers shipped from the port of 
Mogador averages ;^2 0,000 sterling, of which seven-eighths are 
sent to London, and the remainder to France. 

'* Approximate weight, 60 cwt. 

"The ostrich-hunters on the confines of the Sahara or Great 
Desert bring the feathers for sale to the markets of Tindoof, Tee- 
zoon, and Wadnor, where they are bought, either by weight or 
*so much per parcel,* by traders between the above-mentioned 
towns and Mogador. On arrival at Mogador, they are again sold 
to resident merchants by weight, sorted, packed, and shipped to 
Europe." 

The comparatively small exportation from Morocco, amounting, as 
above stated, to ;^2 0,000, being one-fifth of the value of exports 
from Barbary, and one-seventh of that from the Cape (putting the 
value of the export of wild feathers from South Africa at ;£"! 40,000 
per annum), is very remarkable, and tends to prove that there are 
only three important ostrich-feather markets in Africa, namely, 
Cairo and Tripoli in the north, and Port Elizabeth (with Cape 
Town) in the South. 



SENEGAL. 

To M. le Commandant Chaumont, Chef d*^tat major du Gouver- 
neur at Saint Louis, the capital of French Senegal, we are indebted 
for the following interesting particulars, obHgingly communicated by 
him, loth August 1875 : — 

'* His Excellency the Governor, Colonel Valli^re, having quitted 
the colony on leave of absence, I have great pleasure in sending you 
the information required on the subject of ostrich feathers from 
this colony. 



APPENDIX. 



239 



"In 1874 the export of featherB from Senegal amounted to 
61,000 francs {,£,"2^00), and I believe about the same amount will bo 
exported this year (1873). They are generally shipped to Bordeaux 
by the steamers of the Missageries Maritimes. All the feathers 
come from Soudan in Senegal, namely, from a country situated 
between 11' and 18° N. latitude and lo" to iS" W, longitude.
