INTRODUCTION 

nr^HFj original of this little book was found in 
^ the library of a diftinguijhed EJfex antiquary: 
the document has unfortunately no hijlory^ but 
from its appearance and comprehenfve character 
it muji have been the ft ill-room book offome manor 
houfe or homejlead of /landing, 

The manufcript is a folio compofed entirely of 
velluniy bound in green ^ with a conventional defign 
in gold: the binding of this book is a reduced 
facfimile of the original. The writing is in the 
hand of fever al per Jons: the fpelling and abfence 
of punctuation are here reproduced in all their 
original quaintnefs, The book has been fubmitted 
to experts^ who are of opinion that it covers a 
period of fome fifty years ^ termijiating about the 
middle of the eighteenth century. 

The condition of many of the rural difiriBs of 
England in the eighteenth century and the almofi im- 
pajfable ftate of the roads are brought home to us by a 
writer in " The Gentleman's Magazine'' (1757), 
in the following defer ipt ion: " It took my horje up 
to the belly the fecond ftep he took on the road,, and 
had I not difmounted and clambered up fome bujhes 
I had been lodged there for a feafon." The ifola- 
tion of the country in thofe days is almofi incon- 



iwl20366 



ceivabte; the difficulties of travel were immenfe^ 
and afurvivaloffeudallegijlation tied the labourer 
to the foil. Thus we may look upon the manor or 
farmhoufe, with its retainers, as a detached focial 
unit, and, in a fparfely populated country, almoji 
a fate in itfelf 

It is not difficult to form a pidlure of the lady 
of the houfe: amid her other duties /he dijpenfed 
doles and charity to the poor around her. Through 
her knowledge offmples /he was alfo ''fimpler " of 
all the ills that fe/h is heir to, not only in the cafe 
of man, but alfo of be aft, Thewifdom and ohferva- 
tion of a long procefjion of forebears are fummed up 
in the recipes gathered in this hook. 

Herbs, too, fhe knew, and well of each could fpeak, 
That in her garden fip'd the filvery dew ; 
Where no vain flower difclofd a gaudy ftreak ; 
But herbs for ufe, and phyfic, not a few, 
Of grey renown within thofe borders grew ; 
The tufted baiil, pun-provoking thyme, 
Frefh balm, and mary-gold of cheerful hue; 
The lowly gill, that never dares to climb ; 

# ♦ * ♦ * 

And lavender, whofe fpikes of azure bloom 

Shall be ere-while in arid bundles bound 

To lurk amidft the labours of her loom, 

And crown her kerchiefs clean, with mickle rare perfume. 

In thefe days, when the good manager is fear ce, 
it is perhaps difficult to realize or appreciate that 
domeftic ceconomy was once pradlifed as a fcience, 
founded upon the older herhalifts, houjewives' tales 
and oral tradition, the whole adminiftered by 
rule of thumb. As will be feen, the domeftic 
pharmacopoeia had not yet emerged from the feven- 

vl 



teenth century, The ajiro logical atmofphere of Cul- 
pepper^ who warns us that he " who would know the 
operation of the herbs mujl look up to the Jiars 
ajlrologically,'* and the writings of Parkin/on^ 
clearly fhow the influence of that period. The pre- 
dominance of the healing properties of herbs is fill 
more apparent in this book; there is not a fngle 
remedy or fmple in which their virtues are not fet 
forth. 

In my ladys garden^ fet within its red-brick 
walls., grew Camomile^ Bafl^ Cardons., Angelica^ 
Sweet Chevril^ Tanfy., Saffron., Elecampane., ^yf- 
fop., Thyme, Marjoram., Purflane, Sage, Rofemary, 
Rue, Pennyroyal, Borage, Liquorice^ Horehound 
and many other plants. With thefe herbs were 
cultivated Gillyflower., P^^fy, Pinks, Bergamot, 
Southernwood, Bay, Rofes, fafmine, Lavender 
and divers fweet-fcented plants for the making of 
Jimples, perfumes, and '^fweete waters.'' 

Tlie houfewife, before entering on her duties, 
mufl have ferved an apprenticefliip; doubt lefs it 
formed the ferious buflnefs of her life. How many 
women nowadays follow the example of their 
anceflors? The eafy accefs of the doilor, the 
facilities of communication, the quack remedies ob- 
tained from the neighbouring chymifl, have fuper- 
feded the old-fajhioned flmples. 

The old herb garden is a wildernefs, and even 
the names of its occupants have almofl paffed away. 
Perchance this little book may help us to picture it 
at its prime, with all its old-world atmofphere, 
and haunting memories of much that is flill precious. 
It may alfo bring back the fweet mingled f cent of 

vii 



the herb garden, the '* murmuring of innumerable 
bees^' the Jliimmering of the fun on Jheltered pleaf- 
aunce and well-trimmed hedge of yew, creating an 
image delightful to recall. 

Although many herbals and culinary manu- 
fcripts and books date back to a much earlier 
period, as may be feen in the bibliography, yet they 
are now fcarce and difficult to obtain, "This par- 
ticular example is inter ejiing becaufe of the magic 
of its herb-lore and the added charm of the making 
of conferves and perfumes and the preferring of 
viands. Moreover, it has that per final touch want- 
ing info many books of afmilar nature. One may 
note the words at the end of fome of the fimples, 
" Probatum^ or ^'' Probatum eft'' What a world 
of meaning and fat is faB ion they imply! 

I am indebted to Mifs I. L. Gould and Mifs 
B. M. Gould for the long labour and per fever ance 
they have beftowed in de cyphering the faded fcript , 
arid to Mr, f. Manning Watts for his refe arc lies 
into the virtues and properties formerly attributed 
to thefe herbs ^ and for his inveftigation into the 
proper fpelling of their names, which appear in the 
manufcript according to the light of nature. 

It will be obferved that the items in the Index 
are not always in ftridt alphabetical order, 'This 
will not, however, ferioufty interfere with refer- 
ence to any recipe, and it has therefore been thought 
better to retain them as originally compiled,
