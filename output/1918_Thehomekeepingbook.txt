The following pages will be changed with 
subsequent editions 

for the purpose of adapting each edition as fully as pos- 
sible to the latest current doctrines and recommenda- 
tions of the U. S. Food Administration, the Department 
of Agriculture and other national and state commissions 
and bureaus in 

helping the public solve the specisd 
economic problems relating to the 
disturbed conditions to w^hich the 
American public must now and 
shall be compelled to continue to 
make constant readjustment. 

It is thought best that the main body of the volume 
shall not be too far amended to fit these changing con- 
ditions. The Home-Keeping Book is intended for a 
permanent addition to the home library. The text of 
the book should remain as it is compiled, to fit usual 
and normal times, amended only to fit changes which 
will or should become permanent in our manner of life. 

The "home-keeper" how^ever positively must teJce 
into consideration and put into practice during the 
national emergency the special economies, the substitu- 
tions, and the spirit of co-operation in the stoppage of 
w^aste and other conservation measures, as are 

specially outlined in the pages

UNTIL NEXT HARVEST 



UNITED STATES FOOD ADMINISTRATION 



Washington, April, 1918 



Now Is the hour of our testing. Let us make it the hour of our 
victory — victory over ourselves ; victory over the enemy of freedom 
—Home Card, 1918. 

The following restrictions are a military necessity: 

Cut down the consumption of wheat by at least one-half. 

Households keep within a weekly allowance for each person of one and a 
half pounds of flour and all other w^heat products. 

Public eating places keep within the same allowance for every twenty-one 
meals served; not more than two ounces of wheat products, flour included, to be 
served to a guest at any one meal. 

Retail purchases of flour to be limited in quantity and to be accompanied by 
at least equal weight of other cereals. 

Bakers to keep within 70 per cent, of flour formerly used; three-quarter 
pound loaves to go as far as the pound loaf usually does. 

No w^heat to be used in manufacturing for anything but food. 

Let all who can go w^ithout wheat. 



THE WHEAT SHORTAGE 

The wheat situation is the most serious in the 
food supply of the Allied World. 

Our harvest was less than estimated; needs of 
the Allies are greater than v^ere calculated; losses 
by sea and by battle have been heavier than ■were 
anticipated; less comes from the Argentine tht,'n 
had been hoped; tenser demands on shipping space 
restrict ships more than ever to the shortest haul 
and the tightest bulk. 

We have fallen behind in our program. Be- 
cause corn and oats were so tardy in coming to 
market, we have not been able to ship as much as 
we should, we have eaten further into our stock 
of wrheat than we would. 

Corn cannot be shipped now. We have sent it 
as fast as we could and we will again. But dur- 
ing the next two months, the season of germina- 
tion, it will not do to ship corn — there is too much 
spoilage in shipment. 

There is no margin anywhere. The Allies have 
wheat to-day but their stocks are down to the dan- 
ger point. We dare not let anything stop the flow 
of wheat overseas. That would be disaster greater 
than defeat of an army. 

We must send wheat — and more wheat — and 
more. To redeem our obligation we must cut 
down by half our own consumption of wheat. 

WHO SHALL BEAR THE BURDEN 

Going without wheat is an inconvenience — noth- 
ing worse — for homes in comfortable circum- 
stances. 

It is no hardship — no danger. Physiologists all 



agree that a ^vhoiesome diet need not include wheat. 
The South fought the Civil War three years on 
corn. Early New England did without wheat five 
years at a time with no ill effects. 

Going without wheat is perhaps more expense, 
certainly more work. Not a hardship but a bur- 
den. Who shall bear the burden? 

Shall we ask the women of France to do it? 
Do you know what it means to them? 

The v^romen of France are doing their own work, 
doing the nation's work, even doing the work of 
teams in the field. 

The men are gone all but the younger boys, 

the aged and the invalids. In almost every home 

is a cripple or one dying of tuberculosis an added 

care. 

French homes have not baked bread for hun- 
dreds of years. They have not even ovens nor 
baking tins in their kitchens. They rely on the 
bakery. 

If you ask them to bake their own bread — for 

the bakery cannot supply quick breads the women 

of France must add another hour to their long 
day of toil. 

Will you ask them to do that? Or shall our 
homes carry the extra burden of doing without 
wheat? 

WHAT TO DO WITH THE FLOUR 

One and a half pounds of wheat flour goes into 
two and a half pounds of Victory bread. That 

gives just about two slices for each meal with 

nothing over for cake, pastry or anything else. 

One pound of wheat flour goes into one-and- 
three-quarter pounds of Victory bread, which 



S-4 



SUPPLEMENT— UNTIL NEXT HARVEST 



S-5 



makes twenty-eight one-ounce slices, or four a day. 
That leaves half a pound of wheat flour for cake, 
pastry, macaroni, and incidental cooking. 

Muffins and biscuit — medium size made on a 

fifty-fifty recipe, use a quarter ounce each of wheat 
flour. 

A fair slice of cake or a piece of one-crust pie, 
also on a fifty-fifty recipe, likew^ise takes about 
one-quarter ounce of w^heat. 

An ordinary serving of w^heaten breakfast foods, 
or a half cup of cooked macaroni or spaghetti con- 
tains an ounce of wheat. 

Wheatless meals and days kept as before, and 
Victory bread at the remaining ten meals, will use 
about tw^elve ounces of wheat. 

Going w^ithout wheat at other meals — or at all 
meals — let potatoes, rice, hominy and other cereals 
take the place of bread, or bread may be eaten 
that contains no w^heat. 

Food Will Win the War! Food to-day means 
first of all Wheat. 

DOING WITHOUT WHEAT 

Bread and milk make a meal; so wil Imush and 
milk. 

Bread and gravy go together; potatoes and gravy 
are just as nourishing. 

Toast and fruit are fine for breakfast; but any 
other cereal with fruit will stay the stomach as 
effectively. 

Griddle cakes, muffins, all sort of quick breads, 
can be filling and appetizing without any wheat. 

After all, what we have to do is eat less bread. 
Often w^e eat it to convey other food; we even use 
bread to push mouthfuls upon the fork. 

There is one test. Wherever bread is used for 
convenience, that is the place to leave it out. 

Habit tells us to use bread; the body's needs tell 
us only to provide sufficient nourishment. We 
must learn to think in terms of nourishment and 
net let habit hinder us. 

Changing our habits is none too easy. But it is 
no easy task to win the w^ar. 

Going without w^heat wherever we can is one 

thing we can do to win the war perhaps the 

largest contribution we can make. 

LET ALL WHO CAN DO MORE 

The best we can do, it will not be enough to 
meet all needs. We cannot make up the subma- 
rine losses, nor replace the spent reserves. 



Doing our utmost, not everyone in this country 
can keep within the allowance. Masses in crowded 
cities, w^ith no proper kitchen outfits, depend on 
bakery bread and ready cooked food. Their habits 
are controlled by their circumstances. 

Those who can must do more to maintain the 
margin. 

Some wheat in any case must be brought from 
Argentine, the less the better. For every voyage 
to the Argentine is the same as taking two vessels 
from the short Atlantic ferry. Every vessel taken 
from that traffic keeps a regiment from the front. 

Going without wheat adds directly to our forces 
in battle. Going without wheat loosens the ship- 
ping tension which limits our armed strength. 

A splendid response comes instantly. Hundreds 
of hotels have pledged themselves to go w^ithout 
wheat until harvest. Households, communities, 
countries all over the land have cut down wheat to 
the limit or given it up altogether. 

But the best we can do is too little. Let all 
keep within the allowance; let all who can, do 
more. 

WHEAT IS THE TEST 

Germany's war of starvation is a challenge most 
of all to America. 

Against Germany's lust for dominion, America's 
purpose is to establish the society of nations. 
Against destruction, America's aim is healing. 
Against mastery, America's ideal is service. 

We cannot surpass the steadfastness of Britain, 
the courage of taly, the exaltation of France. 

We cannot excell the Allies in heroism, in en- 
durance, in fortitude. Our force in battle though 

it may be decisive — will not be as great as theirs. 

We can hope to contribute most to the common 
cause from our larger resources. To relieve des- 
perate privation, America can supply food. 

Giving up w^heat is a little thing compared to 

their death struggle in which our soldiers are 

splendidly sharing. 

A little thing — yet we can do it with greatness 
of spirit. Supporting our army and adding whole- 
hearted service to humanity, it is in America's 
pow^er to defeat forever the passion of conquest. 

Now is the hour of our testing. Wheat is the 
Test. 



WAYS IN WHICH WOMEN CAN HELP 
WITH THE LOCAL MARKETING PROBLEM 

1 . Study existing local conditions — not for the purpose merely of criticiz- 
ing, but rather for the purpose of trying to improve marketing faciUties. 

(a) Study the general system used in handling foodstuffs locally. 

(b) Learn the various agencies engaged in the business and the services 

performed, as well as the costs assessed by each. 

2 . Co-operate intelUgently with dealers, in endeavoring to improve market- 
ing conditions, and be willing to do your share to effect betterments. Consumers 
are largely responsible for expensive and wasteful retail marketing practices, and 
they must help if such practices are to be eliminated. 

3 . Concentrate attention on the elimination of waste in home marketing. 

(a) Curtail ordering by telephone so far as possible. 

(b) Never ask unnecessary credit or delivery service. 

(c) Encourage local grocers to adopt a system whereby a low^ cash price 

is placed on goods at the store and fair charges made for 
credit and delivery. This places the cost of credit and delivery 
on those who use it and gives the housewfe who pays cash and 
carries her packages home a price concession for so doing. 

(d) Develop the marketing habit — personally superintend the buying of 

foodstuffs. 

(e) Study comparative food values and food substitutes. 

(f) Do not get into the habit of asking for the "best" of everything. 

Usually one can find perfectly satisfactory goods among the 
less expensive grades after a little experiment. 

(g) Check up weights and measures of all purchases. 

(h) Study the comparative advantages of "bulk vs. package goods," and 
^ w^hen bulk goods of satisfactory quality offer a saving insist on 

your dealer carrying them in stock. 

4 . Work through your organizations to interest your new^spapers in fur- 
nishing reliable, non-technical market news and market hints for housewives. 

Such a service should keep you informed in regard to the supplies of prod- 
ucts entering the market and the prices which your dealers pay, and offer sugges- 
tions as to the best time to can, preserve or store for winter use. In this service, 
special effort should be made to inform consumers ahead of time of impending 
gluts of certain products, so that plans can be made for utilizing them. 

If such an arrangement cannot be made through newspapers, try to ar- 
range a substitute service whereby committees of organizations will co-operate with 
local produce dealers and public market officials, in securing and disseminating such 
information periodically.

A GUIDE IN BAKING 

SAVE WHEAT — USE WHEAT SUBSTITUTES 

MEASUREMENTS OF SUBSTITUTES EQUAL TO 
ONE CUP OF FLOUR 

These weights and measures were tested in the Experimental Kitchen of the U. S. 
Food Administration, Home Conservation Division, and of the U. S. Department of 
Agriculture, Office of Home Economics. 

In substituting for one cup of flour use the following measurements. Each is equal 
in weight to a cup of flour. 

Barley I % cups Potato flour % cup 

Buckwheat Vs cup Rice flour Ys cup 

Corn flour 1 cup (scant) Rolled oats 1 '/2 cups 

Corn meal (coarse) Yq cup Rolled oats (ground in 

Corn meal (fine) .... 1 cup (scant) meat choper) 1 '/e cups 

Cornstarch % cup Soy-bean flour Y& cup 

Peanut flour 1 cup (scant) Sweet potato flour 1 J/g cups 

This table will help you to make good griddle cakes, muffins, cakes, cookies, drop 
biscuits, and nut or raisin bread without using any wheat flour. 

You will not need ne-w recipes. Just use the ones your family has always liked, but 
for each cup of flour use the amount of substitute given in the table. You can change 
your muHin recipe like this: 

Old Recipe New Recipe 

2 cups wheat flour I ^ cups barley flour 

4 teaspoons baking powder 1 cup (scant) corn flour 

'/4 teaspoon salt 4 teaspoons baking powder 

1 tablespoon sugar Y4 teaspoon salt 

1 cup milk I tablespoon sugar 

1 egg I cup milk 

I tablespoon fat I egg 

1 tablespoon fat 
The only difference is the substitution for the wheat flour. Everything else remains 

the same. You can change all of your recipes in a similar way. 

GOOD COMBINATIONS OF SUBSTITUTES 

You will get better results if you mix two substitutes than if you use just one alone. 
Some good combinations are 

Rolled oats (ground) \ / Corn flour 

or I I or 

Barley flour / \ Rice flour 

or f • j or 

Buckwheat flour > and < Potato flour 

or [ j or 

Peanut flour \ / Sweet potato flour 

or I or 

Soy-bean flour / \ Corn meal 

CAUTIONS 

1. All measurements should be accurate, A standard measuring cup is equal to a half 
pint. 

2. The batter often looks too thick, and sometimes too thin, but you will find that if you 
have measured as given in the table the result will be good after baking. 

3. Bake all substitute mixtures more slowly and longer. 

4. Drop biscuits are better than the rolled biscuits, when substitutes are used. 

5. Pie crusts often do not roll well and have to be patted on to the pan. They do not 
need chilling before baking.

SPEAKERS' BULLETIN No. 6 
UNITED STATES FOOD ADMINISTRATION 



Washington, February, 1918. 



By order of the U. S. Food Administration: 

With every pound of flour sold at retail, there must be sold 
an equal weight of corn, oats, rice, barley, or other cereal, 
one or any assortment. 

This rule applies to every one alike. Exception has been made only 
where other cereals were not to be had — only till the shortage could 
be overcome — and only by order of the Federal Food Administrator 

The situation has become critical. There is simply not enough food in 
Europe. Yet the soldiers of the Allies must be maintained in full strength; their 
wives and children at home must not face famine; the friendly neutrals must not 
be starved; and, finally, our own army in France must never lack a needed ounce 
of food. — Herbert Hoover, 1918 Home-Card. 

Unless you are able to send the Allies at least 75,000,000 bushels of wheat 
over and above what you have exported up to January 1 st, and in addition to the 
total exportable surplus from Canada, 1 cannot take the responsibility of assuring 
our people that there will be food enough to win the war. — Lord Rhondda, British 
Food Controller, cable, January, 1918. 



Whether it suits us or not, 

whether we hke it or not, 
whether it costs more or less, 
we shall eat of our other cereals 
measure for measure with wheat. 



To create a supply of wheat 

the Nation draws on its other grai: 

The fifty-fifty rule, 

binding on everyone everywhere, 
makes all share and share alike. 



THEIR NEED IS DESPERATE 

The Allies need from 75,000,000 to 90,000,000 
bushels more of American wheat. We have al- 
ready exported the theoretical surplus of last har- 
vest. We have saved from 25,000,000 to 50,000,- 
000 bushels during the last five months, which -we 
are now exporting. 

We cannot and -will not export more than our 
savings. The Allies have sharply reduced their 
bread ration to their own people, and if this low- 
ered ration is to be maintained we must save more 
than hitherto. 

Every grain of wheat and every ounce of flour 
and bread saved now is exactly that amount sup- 
plied to some man, woman, or child among the 
Allies. 

UNITED STATES FOOD ADMINISTRATION 
January 11, 1918 



OUR DUTY IS IMPERATIVE 

The Allies find their supply of breadstuffs run- 
ning low. 

It is imperative that we send them an increased 
amount of flour to strengthen the fighting lines 
and keep alive the men and women of France and 
England, Italy and Belgium, who for more than 
three years have had to bear the terrible priva- 
tions of war. 

More flour is also needed by our soldiers abroad. 

To send them and the Allies the flour required 
bakers and housewives must loyally join in using 
larger quantities of wheat-flour substitutes.

THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— SUPPLEMENT 



PRESIDENT WILSON'S APPEAL 



Many causes have contributed to create the ne- 
cessity for a more intensive effort on the part of 
our people to save food in order that we may 
supply our associates in the war with the sus- 
tenance vitally necessary to them in these days of 
privation and stress. 

The reduced productivity of Europe because of 
the large diversion of man power to the war, the 
partial failure of harvests, and the elimination of 
more distant markets for foodstuffs through the 
destruction of shipping, places the burden of their 
subsistence very largely on our shoulders. 

The maintenance of the health and strength of 
our own people is vitally necessary at this time, 
and there should be no dangerous restriction of 
the food supply; but the elimination of every sort 
of waste and the substitution of other commodi- 
ties of which we have more abundant supplies for 
those which we need to save will in no way impair 
the strength of our people and will enable us to 
meet one of the most pressing burdens of the war. 
— By the President, January 18, 1918 

IN THE GRIP OF NECESSITY 

Americans have done a wonderful thing by 
voluntary saving. The like was never done be- 
fore by any people. But we have not done enough. 
Necessity tightens its grip. The crisis grows more 
tense. We must do more — and more — and more 
or we are undone. 

At the first it was reckoned that saving one 
slice of bread in five would make plenty. MilUons 
began saving. But not enough. Some could not, 
some would not, some cared not. Europe's needs 
rose; the submarine toll increased; trade circuits 
shortened; losses were to be made up; new drafts 
were to be met. 

By November it was known that we must set our 
tables with more of corn and oats and other grains. 
But they had not come to market. Until they 
reached the stores, we had to eat further into our 
stock of wheat, expecting to lean more heavily on 
other cereals when they were delivered. 

DRAWING ON RESERVES 

By December we had shipped all the normal 
surplus of wheat. The fall's saving would carry 
us part way; for the rest we had to create a new 
surplus by drawing on the reserves of other grain. 

A new assessment of our obligation was made. 
It was announced: Our object is that we should 
reduce by one-third our consumption of wheat. 
To fulfill that purpose a schedule of wheatless days 
and meals was promulgated. 

Still the markets offered no substitutes. Rail- 
roads were strangled by terminal blockades and 
smothered in cold and snow. Masses of foodstuffs, 
inert in granaries and corncribs, might as well 
have been in Tibet for all the help they gave the 



day's needs — the warehouse was choke-full; there 
was no flow to market. Not till near the end of 
February was a current stock of one or another 
substitute assured for every region. 



ALL CEREALS A SINGLE RESOURCE 

It was high time. The Food Administration 
dared put off no longer the protection of our 
wheat reserves. In our half of the world, all grain 
is virtually a common stock. The Allies have 
their barley and rice, and without much difficulty 
we are making up their shortage of coarse grains. 
We have plenty of cereals all told; we must make 
up the wheat deficit of our associates by drawing 
on our reserves of coarse grains. 

At last we have in every market in the United 
States enough of one or more substitutes to go 
with the wheat. 

To meet the situation, then, the Victory bread 
regulation has been adopte'd and the fifty-fifty rule. 

Whoever bakes bread, pastry, or other vrheat 
products must mingle -witK the wheat flour at least 
one-fifth of other cereal or potatoes. This is Vic- 
tory bread. 

Whoever sells wheat flour or other wheat prod- 
ucts must sell vrith it an equal weight of other 
cereals. This is the fifty-fifty rule. 

FIFTY-FIFTY IN THE HOME 

This is no radical change in diet; only a modi- 
fication. Cereals are part of our ordinary fare. 
Many families begin the day with oatmeal or corn 
flakes. In the South corn bread is as common as 
wheat. In the Southwest feterita flour, elsewhere 
unknown, has become a staple. On the Pacific 
coast they have rice. Fifty-fifty is to be compared 
with customary buying of, say, thirty to sixty. 

One calculation shows an average consumption 
in American homes of two-thirds v^heat and one- 
third other cereals. Another reckoning accounts 
for sales running 8,000,000 barrels of flour to 
6,000,000 barrels of other sorts. 

Briefly, the housewife who has been doing with 
two-thirds wheat and one-third other cereals must 
absorb . equal quantities, which means changing 
from white bread to Victory breads and serving 
more frequently the quick breads, muffins, break- 
fast foods, porridges, and the like. 

SHIFTING THE PROPORTIONS 

Each housewife must work out her problem by 
her own ingenuity and skill, as hardly two families 
have the same habits and tastes. Those learned 
in domestic economy can tell what other adjust- 
ments must be made as the bread quotas are shift- 
ed. But, roughly, this is the problem: 

Given a family using 66 pounds of wheat and 
33 of other cereals: To change to fifty-fifty. Change 
white bread to Victory bread, mixing at least one- 
fifth meal with the flour. That reduces the white 
flour from 66 to 53 pounds and uses up 13 pounds 



SUPPLEMENT— FIFTY-FIFTY 



S-I3 



of the assorted cereals. To cut down white flour 
another 3 or 4 pounds to an even 50, to raise the 
other cereals another 3 or 4 pounds also to an 
even 50, the family must eat muffins or Indian 
puddings often enough to absorb the difference. 
A Or eat cereals as usual and cut the purchase of 
flour in half, make up the difference by eating 
potatoes. Folks who rely on potatoes instead of 
white bread are a long w^ay from starvation. 

Those are two out of two million possible com- 
binations. 

THIS WE MUST DO 

This is no if-you-please affair. We have to. 
Unless we do this w^e are done for. We shall 
whether we like it or not. Every good American 
will shape his habits to the fifty-fifty rule because 
he is a good American. Any other sort will take 
the fifty-fifty rations because that is all he will get. 

There will be no famine. The Government, 
which has absolute control of exports, will not let 



the land go hungry. We could not send that much 
food abroad if we tried — there are not ships 
enough. 

We may have to get along with less w^heat in 
our bread — and we can. We may have to get 
along with less bread in our diet — and we can. 
To-day the rule is fifty-fifty; next month it may 
be sixty and forty. If we drew down the propor- 
tion of wheat to one in ten we would still be well 
nourished. Though there is no sign of that ex- 
tremity, we shall certainly depend more and more 
on our reserves of other food to maintain the flow 
of necessary foodstuffs to Europe. Unless w^e do 
that we are done for. 

All that we have belongs to the Nation — 
A Nation that sets its face against privilege, 
A Nation that despises profit from war, 
A Nation that believes in equality of burden, 
A Nation committed to universal service, 
A Nation living by the rule of equal sacrifice. 

The fifty-fifty rule treats everyone alike. 



THE WHEAT SITUATION 

UNITED STATES FOOD ADMINISTRATION 

Every aspect of the wheat situation, both present and prospective, intensi- 
fies the need for the greatest possible Hmitation in the American consumption of 
wheat and wheat products. If present restrictions should be in the slightest degree 
relaxed it v^^ould result in serious want for the people of Europe before the new 
crop can reach the market. 

The Food Administration's estimate of the position on the first of June in- 
dicates a total available supply until the new harvest, including the grain which 
will be available from the farms, in country and terminal elevators, and mill ele- 
vators, of about 56,000,000 bushels. Of this 30,000,000 bushels must be ex- 
ported before new wheat is available for export if we are to maintain the absolutely 
necessary shipments to our Army and the Allies. That leaves about 26,000,000 
bushels for domestic consumption for the next two months. 

Normal American consumption is something over 40,000,000 bushels a 
month, so that the most liberal consumption at home would be only one-third of 
normal. 

In addition to the wheat on the farms and in elevators there is always an 
indeterminate further amount in transit and in dealers' hands, and this can never 
be reckoned in w^ith the flour available for use for export and at home. As a mat- 
ter of fact, this stock is not actually available, since these supplies must remain 
constantly in flow; they remain a permanent stock, the removal of which would 
later cause a period of acute shortage in distribution before new wheat w^ould be 
available. There is further an inclination to include new crop prospects with pres- 
ent conditions, which has led to confusion. The harvest will not be generally avail- 
able in flour until the middle of August or early September, although in the extreme 
South it w^ill be somew^hat earlier. At a meeting of the Federal Food Adminis- 
tration in Washington yesterday, representing all 48 States, it w^as the unanimous 



S-14 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— SUPPLEMENT 

view that even if the harvest does prove abundant it will be the first duty of the 
American people to place every grain they can save into storage against possible 
bad years ahead. In consequence there should be no anticipation of unlimited 
wheat bread until the war is over. 

Some of the most inconvenient restrictions can no doubt be modified with 
the arrival of a large harvest, but if w^e are honest with ourselves we will maintain 
restrictions requiring the use of some substitutes, both domestic and commercial; 
we will continue the requirement of high milling extraction and the elimination of 
the non-essential use of and w^aste of flour and bread. 

It is worth remembering that the famine in Egypt eight thousand years 
ago was saved by a little governmental foresight, and it does not require any 
illuminating dream to anticipate that so long as the war lasts, with its increasing 
drafts for soldiers and munition w^orkers, the w^orld w^ill steadily produce less food. 
If we are wise, a great harvest will mean the willing building up of great national 
reserves. 



CHOOSE YOUR FOOD WISELY 

(United States Food Leaflet No. 4) 

STUDY THESE FIVE FOOD GROUPS 

Every food you eat may be put into one of these groups. Each group 
serves a special purpose in nourishing your body. You should choose some food 
from each group daily. 

1 . VEGETABLES AND FRUITS. 

2. MILK, EGGS, FISH, MEAT, CHEESE, BEANS, PEAS, PEA- 

NUTS. 

3. CEREALS— CORN MEAL, OATMEAL, RICE, BREAD, ETC. 

4. SUGAR, SYRUPS, JELLY, HONEY, ETC. 

5. FATS— BUTTER, MARGARINE, COTTONSEED OIL, OLIVE 

OIL, DRIPPINGS, SUET. 

You can exchange one food for another in the same group. For example, 
oatmeal may be used instead of wheat, and eggs, or sometimes beans, instead of 
meat; but oatmeal cannot be used instead of milk. Use both oatmeal and milk. 

The sugar group, while very useful to the body, is not so necessary as the 
others to keep us in health. It helps make our food taste good, however. 

It is interesting to count up how much of each group you use daily. Here 
are the amounts that a man doing moderate work could well use. A woman, be- 
ing smaller, would use about four-fifths the amount, and children still less, but be 
sure that each child has at least a pint, or better, a quart of milk each day.

Count up what you are eating. Learn whether you are using economical

REMEMBER THE FIVE GROUPS 

Fruits and Vegetables furnish some of the material from w^hich the body is 
made and keep its many parts working smoothly. They help prevent constipa- 
tion w^hich gives you headaches and makes you stupid. The kinds you choose 
depend upon the season, but remember that the cheaper ones are often as valu- 
able as the more expensive. 

Milk, Eggs, Fish, Meat, Peas, Beans — These help build up the growing 
body and renew^ used-up parts. That is their main business. Dried peas and beans 
make good dishes to use in place of meat part of the time, but don't leave out the 
other foods entirely. Milk is the most important. Buy at least a pint a day for 
every member of your family. No other food can take its place for children. Save 
on meat if you must, but don't skimp on milk. 

Cereals — Bread and breakfast foods. These foods act as fuel to let you do 
your w^ork, much as the gasoline burning in an automobile engine makes the car 
go. This you can think of as their chief business. And they are usually your 
cheapest fuel. Besides, they give your body some building material. 

Don't think that wheat bread is the only kind of cereal food. The Gov- 
ernment asks us to save w^heat to send abroad to our soldiers and the Allies. Let 
the North try the Southern corn bread and the South the oatmeal of the North. 
Half the fun in cooking is in trying new things. An oatmeal pudding is delicious. 
See Leaflet No. 6 for the recipe. 

Sugar and Syrups are fuel, too. and they give flavor to other foods. They 
are valuable food, but many people eat more of them than they need. Sweet fruits, 
of course, contain much sugar and are better for the children than candy. 

Fat is fuel — Some is needed especially by hard-working people. Remem- 
ber that expensive fats are no better fuel than cheap ones. Use drippings. Don't 
let your butcher keep the trimmings from your meat. They belong to you. Chil- 
dren need some butter fat. Give it to them in plenty of whole milk or in butter. 



HOUSEHOLD CONSERVATION— FOOD 

(Iowa State College of Agriculture) 

GUARD THE FOOD SUPPLY 

Food is now the world's greatest need. The fields of Europe are devas- 
tated, crops are short in the southern hemisphere and some of our own farmers 
must enlist for military service. Our food reserves are limited and we must not 
only feed our soldiers at the front but also the army that remains at home to fight 
for the world's sustenance. 

We must keep only what we need and send all we can spare to help feed our 
hungry neighbors. 

A slice of bread saved every day seems a mere trifle, but it means two dozen 
loaves of bread in a year. Will you save the trifle? 



SAVE FOOD IN THE FOLLOWING WAYS 

By careful buying. 
By careful storing and handling. 
By proper cooking and serving. 
By sane eating. 
By eliminating waste. 

By substituting cheaper foods for more expen- 
sive. 

FOOD MONEY IS WASTED 

By ordering by telephone. 

By ordering indefinitely, by price rather than by 
vireight. 

By buying perishable foods in too large quan- 
tities. 

By buying "out of season" foods (strawberries 
in December). 

By buying ready to eat foods (breakfast foods, 
canned soups). 

By buying foods high in price, and low in food 
value (asparagus tips, oysters, pimentos and mush- 
rooms). 

By "living out of paper bags." 

By buying staple foods in small packages (corn- 
meal, rice). 

By buying for wants rather than for needs. 

BREADSTUFFS ARE WASTED 

By careless storing of cereals (flour, meal, ad- 
mitting insects). 

By leaving flour and dough adhering to bread 
bowl and board. 

By bread failures due to wrong handling and 
baking. 

By discarding left overs, biscuits, muffins, ends 
of loaves. v^Bread crumbs may be used in numer- 
ous ways.) 

By underbaking, resulting in souring when few 
days old. 

By improper storing of bread, resulting in sour- 
ing and molding. 



MEATS ARE WASTED 

By careless storing. 

By leaving trimmings at market fat and bones. 

By discarding excess fat all fat is usable. 

By discarding bones — useful in soups. (Remove 
surplus fat and bone before cooking.) 

By wrong cooking. 

By discarding left overs. 

By discarding juices and broths. 

By providing too much in the diet. 

By overeating on part of individuals. (One 
meatless day each week will help to conserve the 
supply of meat and to improve health.) 

VEGETABLES ARE WASTED 

By careless storing. 

By taking thick parings, sometimes 20 per cent, 
of edible portion. Save food by cooking in jackets. 

By discarding small-sized vegetables. 

By discarding water in which vegetables are 
cooked. Steaming saves food material. 

By discarding leaves and stem (beet tops, turnip 
tops, outer stalks and leaves of celery). 

By overcooking. 

By undercooking 

By cooking larger quantity than is needed. 

By discarding left overs. 

MILK IS WASTED 

By careless handling. 

By discarding buttermilk (use for cookery and 
beverages). 

By discarding separated milk (use for cheese 
and cookery). 

By discarding skim milk (use for cheese and 
cookery). 

By discarding sour milk (use for cheese and 
cookery). 

By discarding whey (use in bread making). 



S-16 



SUPPLEMENT— HOUSEHOLD CONSERVATION— FOOD 



S-17 



FUEL IS WASTED 

By cooking a few dishes at a time. (Heat cook 
stove less often and cook nnore dishes at a time. 
Have oven full of baking.) 

By turning gas or kerosene flame higher than 
necessary. (No time is saved by boiling the kettle 
over.) 

By leaving gas turned on to save re-lighting. 

By the use of poor stoves — ovens particularly. 
(Much fuel may be saved by the use of the fireless 
cooker.) 

SOME EXPENSIVE MISTAKES IN SERVING 
In the Home 

Too large quantities placed on individual plates. 

The same amounts served to each, regardless 
of appetite. 

The same foods served to each, regardless of 
taste. 

Elaborate menus for entertaining. 

In Boarding House, Restaurant and Hotel 

Same foods served to each individual; no choice 
offered. 

Same-sized portions served to all alike (choice 
of half portions should be offered). 

Too great a variety offered at each meal (means 
greater waste). 

At School Functions 

Menus much too elaborate. (Simpler menu 
serves purpose of sociability and saves food.) 

SOME EXPENSIVE MISTAKES IN EATING 

By eating more than is needed. 

By eating foods in wrong proportions. 

By eating too rapidly; less food is required if 
eaten slowly and chew^ed thoroughly. 

By serving one's self more food that is w^anted 
(butter, bread, etc.). 



By eating crusts and discarding soft portion, and 
vice versa. 

By placing excess of sugar in tea and coffee. 
(Undissolved sugar in cup is wasted.) 

SOME WAYS OF REDUCING FOOD EXPENSE 

Use MILK in all forms and in all possible ways. 
Buttermilk and separated milk have good food 
value. 

Use corn products — meal, grits and hominy. 
These should be used largely to save wheat prod- 
ucts. 

Use oatmeal and rice. Broken rice costs less 
than the whole rice. 

Use more of the cheaper vegetables, as "greens,** 
carrots, turnips, parsnips, and rutabagas. Such 
vegetables are necessary when substituting rice 
and corn products for potatoes. 

Use some dried fruits — apples, peaches, apricots, 
prunes, raisins, or figs. 

Use cheaper cuts of meat. Bacon ends are sold 
at reduction. 

Use some nuts instead of meat. Peanuts are 
cheapest. 

Use some cheese instead of meat. There is less 
w^aste in cheese. 

Use some dried fish and salt fish. 

Use less tea and coffee. 

Pay cash. 

Satisfy body needs rather than vagaries of appe- 
tite. 

FOOD PREJUDICES 

All food material that is clean and w^holesome 
is fit to be eaten. Overcome food prejudices, they 
are no more reasonable than other prejudices. 

FOOD EXHIBITS 

No perishable food exhibits should be held at 
fairs, farmers' institutes and other such meetings 
while the shortage lasts. 



WHY WE MUST SEND WHEAT 

UNITED STATES FOOD ADMINISTRATION 

Supplying Wheat for the Annies and the Allies Is a Military Necessity and an Act 

of National Defense, the Redemption of a National Obligation 

to Which Our National Honor Is Pledged 

Washington, May, 1918 

The Allies ask America for wheat, rye, corn, barley, and oats, and we are 
sending them in large amounts. They ask us especially, however, for wheat. 
They ask it as the necessary basis for their necessary loaf. They must have bread, 
and they must have bread w^hich will keep sweet and palatable for several days. 

Wheat is the basis for the durable raised bread loaf. 



S-18 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— SUPPLEMENT 

Troops must have bread carried to the front from bakeries behind the lines ; 
it must be a durable raised loaf. 

Workers in the war factories must have bread from commercial bakeries. 
The women in the factories cannot be bakers also. Their bread must be the dur- 
able raised loaf. 

All France depends on the bakeries for its bread. The people do not know 
how to bake in the home. They have no ovens for baking, nor could they afford 
fuel for them if they had. 

All the bread of France and England and Italy to-day is war bread. It is 
made of gray wheat flour, milled at a high extraction rate; that is, a larger pro- 
portion of the wheat grain is now put into the flour than formerly was the case. 
Their flour now contains more of the outer parts of the wheat grain, parts which 
formerly were separated from the flour and used as feed for animals. This flour is 
then mixed -with as large a percentage — usually 25 per cent — of flour made from 
other cereals as can be used and still permit the making of the raised loaf. 

In England this w^ar bread cannot be sold until it is 12 hours old, so that the 
people w^on't be tempted to eat too much fresh bread. In France and Italy the 
bread is rationed according to the age and occupation of each person. A child 
has less than an adult; a light worker less than one w^ho does heavy labor. 

France has always lived on bread. Of the average Frenchman's normal diet 
52 per cent is composed of bread and but 48 per cent of other foods. France has 
just put her whole people on a rigorous bread ration, which limits them to only two- 
thirds of the amount they have been accustomed to. In all the Allied countries 
they are using as little wheat as will give them bread at all, and as little of this 
bread as is possible to keep them in health and strength. 

The people of Belgium are living on a relief ration. Over 1 ,000,000 of 
them get their daily bread and soup by standing in line long hours before the re- 
lief kitchens. They have stood in these long soup lines every day for three and 
one-half years. But they do not complain. They only ask that the soup and bread 
be there every day. They depend upon America. 

We are, as we have said, sending corn and other cereals to England, France, 
Italy and Belgium. These cereals are shipped as fast as they can be used. But the 
people cannot live on them alone. They do not know how. They are unable to cook 
them properly. They must have wheat to mix with them and with potatoes to 
make their bread. We are now sending 'wheat to the limit of our cargo space, 
and yet we are only meeting the minimum requirements of these people. In order 
to continue doing this, our people must share their present wheat supply. 

We are dividing our wheat evenly to-day between ourselves and the Allies. 
We must not use before the next harves more than one-half of the wheat we have. 
Even with one-half of our wheat the loaf of the Allies is small. It cannot be 
made smaller without undermining their strength and morale. Is there any doubt 
what we shall do in this emergency? We have just one thing to do, and that is to 
save w^heat and send w^heat. 



II 



SUPPLEMENT— WHY WE MUST SEND WHEAT SI 9 

IS WHEAT INDISPENSABLE IN OUR DIET? 

The question naturally arises, however: To what extent can the wheat to 
which we are now accustomed in our diet be reduced without injury to the health 
of the individuals of the Nation? This question was put by the Food Administra- 
tion to a committee of experts recently assembled in Washington to consider the 
special physiological problems involved in the general problem of wheat conserva- 
tion. 

Dr. R. H. Chittenden, Professor of Physiological Chemistry and Dean of Sheffield Scientific 
School, Yale. 

Dr. Graham Lusk, Professor of Physiology, Cornell University. 

Dr. E. V. McColIum, Professor of Bio-Chemistry, Johns Hopkins University. 

Dr. L. B. Mendel, Professor of Physiological Chemistry, Yale University. 

C. L. Alsberg, Chief of the Bureau of Chemistry, U. S. Department of Agriculture. 

Dr. F. C. Langworthy, Chief, Home Economics Office, States Relations Service, U. S. Depart- 
ment of Agriculture. 

Dr. Alonzo E. Taylor, Professor of Physiological Chemistry, University of Pennsylvania. 

Prof. Vernon Kellogg, Stanford University. 

Dr. Raymond Pearl, School of Hygiene, Johns Hopkins University. 

Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur, formerly Dean of the Stanford University Medical School; now 
President of Stanford University. 

The committee, as may be seen, was composed of the highest physiological 
authorities in the country. Their answer to the question was direct and unequiv- 
ocal. 

It is the scientific opinion of the committee that in a mixed diet wheat may be entirely 
replaced, without harm, by other available cereals, namely, rice, barley, oats, and corn. 
However, we should not recommend this except as an emergency measure. 

The committee's particular reason for not recommending this, apart from 
the fact that wheat is perhaps the most convenient cereal for use because of its 
special qualities connected with the making of bread in loaves that will stand up 
and remain sweet and palatable for several days, is that going without wheat would 
be a psychological though not a physiological deprivation. We are accustomed as a 
nation, just as most of the nations of Europe are, to the use of wheat bread, and 
a sudden break in our custom would have for some people a psychological signifi- 
cance more or less disturbing. 

However, if these people could well understand the emergency leading to 
the change, and then could recognize that they are aiding their country in the 
great emergency by making the change, this psychological disturbance would be 
much reduced. 

Exactly this condition of a great national emergency, to meet which the 
loyal and patriotic efforts of all the people are needed, is the condition to-day. It 
is only because of this great national emergency that the Food Administration 
makes use of this deliberate judgment of the physiological experts called in for 
advice. 

Even under these circumstances, it is recognized that because of economic 
and commercial reasons, not all of the people of America can go without bread 
based on wheat, but it is certain that a great many people in this country can easily 
do so. It is the belief of the Food Administration that, for the sake of maintaining 
the wheat-bread supply for the armies and civilians of our fighting associates in 
the war, as well as our own soldiers in France, every patriotic American who can 
possibly do so will be glad to dispense entirely with wheat from now until the next 
harvest. 



WAR ECONOMY IN FOOD 

SUBSTITUTIONS IN THE PLANNING OF MEALS 
SUGGESTIONS and RECIPES 



HUMAN FOODSTUFFS COMPRISE THREE 
PRINCIPAL ELEMENTS 

Protein — Mainly present in meat, beans, fish, 
poultry, milk, and to some extent in grains. 

Fats That is, butter, cream, lard, bacon, mar- 
garine, cooking fats, beans, cottonseed oil, and 
other vegetable oils. 

Carbohydrates Grains, sugar, potatoes and 

other vegetables. 

As a nation we eat and vi^aste 80 per cent more 
protein than we require to maintain health. There- 
fore, we can reduce the amount of meat we eat 
without harm. 

We eat and waste 240 per cent more fat than 
is necessary. 

Of the carbohydrates we can just as well con- 
sume corn, oats and other cereals as wheat, and 
we have abundant supplies of potatoes and vege- 
tables. 

Do not limit your supplies of milk and table 
butter, but consume it all. Don't waste any. 

You can reduce the consumption of fats by re- 
ducing pastry and fried foods. 

Remember the gospel of the clean plate, the 
serving of small portions, the purchase of less sup- 
plies. 

Hoarding — Any person in the United States who 
buys more foodstuffs than he customarily keeps at 
home in peace times is defeating the Food Admin- 
istration in its purpose to secure a just distribu- 
tion of food and in its great endeavors to reduce 
prices. The hoarding of food in households is not 
only unnecessary, as the Government is protecting 
the food supply of our people, but it is selfish and 
is a cause of high prices. 

Such actions, multiplied by thousands, increase 
the demands upon our railways for cars and al- 
ready, because of our military demands, it is with 
extreme difficulty we can now move the vitally 
necessary food to markets. 

There is much insidious propaganda in the coun- 
try against conservation and increased production. 
All opposition to these services is direct assistance 
to the enemy. 

SUGGESTIONS FOR SUBSTITUTIONS IN PLAN- 
NING MEALS 

The question of planning meals grows daily more 
important, because it is more evident that food is 
to win or lose the war. 

The housew^ife is in an especially trying posi- 
tion. The needs of her family and the requests 
of the Food Administration seem at first glance at 



variance. The word "save" has been over-empha- 
sized in the public mind and the w^ord ''substitute'* 
overlooked. A closer study reveals the fact that 
what the Food Administration really wishes, and 
our Allies really need is that we restrict ourselves 
in the use of a few staples and encourage the wise 
use of many. From that vie^vpoint the housewife 
has left a large and varied supply of food from 
v^hich to select nourishment adapted to the wishes 
and needs of her family and to the condition of 
her pocketbook. 

LET US REMEMBER 

Let us remember that every flag that flies oppo- 
site the enemy's is by proxy the American flag, 
and that the armies fighting in our defense under 
these flags cannot be maintained through this 
winter unless there is food enough for them and 
for the women and children at home. There can 
be food enough only if America provides it. And 
America can provide it only by the personal serv- 
ice and patriotic co-operation of all of us.

allov^r the railroads to be hauling supplies for the 
army instead of food for my family?

If you have good recipes for bread of any kind 
make them conform to food conservation by omit- 
ting sugar and fat and by using substitutes in 
place of w^heat. Try recipes for yourself w^ith your 
ow^n substitutions. 

YEAST 

Because of the high price of yeast it may be 
economical w^hen bread is made frequently or in 
large quantities to prepare liquid yeast. In making 
the bread the amount of yeast used, of w^hatever 
kind, will depend upon the time in w^hich the proc- 
ess is to be carried through. 

Liquid Yeast — Four medium-sized potatoes, 1 
quart hot w^ater, 1 teaspoonful salt, 1 cake dry 
yeast, softened in ^4 cup of warm water, or 1 
cake compressed yeast, j/^ cup sugar. 

Wash pare and cook the potatoes in the w^ater. 
Drain, mash and return to the water. Make up to 
1 quart. Add the sugar and salt and allow the 
mixture to cool. When lukew^arm add the yeast. 
Keep at room temperature (65° to ZO'^ F.) 
for 24 hours before using. If kept for a longer 
time it should be poured into a sterilized jar and 
put in a dark, cool place. 

Each of these recipes make one loaf. The 
weight of the different breads will vary from 1 8 
ounces to 23 ounces. 



WHEAT SAVING PROGRAM FOR THE 
HOUSEHOLD 

UNITED STATES FOOD ADMINISTRATION 
Washington, April, 1918 

We have got to reach the place — each one of us — where we define every 
decision in our lives as an act of War Policy. Everything that v^^e do — plan — eat 
— wear — must be analyzed and measured from one single point of view: Will it 
contribute to the carrying on of the war or will it contribute to its prolongation? 
There is no other thing in the world for us to do but to define everything in our 
lives as acts of military necessity or policy. 

The first necessity for us is to get a clear conception of the relation of 
wheat in the human diet and to divest ourselves of all preconceptions that are bred 
in us by generations of ease, indolence and luxury. 

WHEAT SAVING PROGRAM FOR THE HOUSEHOLD 

Until harvest the American people must reduce their consumption of wheat 
by one-half. 

The leading hotels of the country have pledged themselves to do without 
wheat until the pressure is eased. Many households are pledging themselves to 
the same measure of devotion to the national cause — no wheat until harvest. 

This is the "no-wheat" program: 

Use no breakfast cereal containing wheat. 

Use no wheat flour to "bind" cornmeal or other cereals in muffins or 

quick breads. 
Use barley flour, corn flour, or cornstarch for thickening soups and 

gravies — no wheat at all. 
Use no bread containing wheat flour. 
This is the "less- wheat" program: 

Use no breakfast cereal containing w^heat. 

Use no wheat flour to "bind" cornmeal or other cereals in muffins or 

quick breads. 
Use no wheat flour for thickening soups or gravies. 
Use wheatless breads as far as possible, making exception where 

necessary for children, aged people, and invalids. 
If bread must be bought, use Victory bread, but as far as possible let 

potatoes, rice, hominy, or other cereals — not including wheat or 

rye — take the place of bread. 

WHEAT-SAVING SCHEDULES 

In those households where it is not possible to I. WITHIN THE ALLOWANCE 

give up wheat entirely, the choice lies between No wheat on wheatless meals and days, using 

cutting the use of wheat as far as possible below instead muffins, griddle cakes, and other hot breads 

1 !/2 pounds per person; or using the pound and a ^ith 100 per cent, substitutes, or using potatoes, 

half partlx in bread and partly in other ways; or rice, and hominy instead of bread. That is, 1 1 

using the pound and a half wholly in bread. meals in the week with no wheat.

THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— SUPPLEMENT 



Bread allowance: At the 10 remaining meals in 
the week allow two 1 -ounce slices of Victory bread 
(equal to 20 ounces of bread) consuming 1 I Yl 
ounces of w^heat flour. 

Other wheat products : Choose from the list 
showing wheat flour in average servings of food 
those which contain the least proportion of wheat 
flour, and serve those as seldom as may be. 

Omit entirely wheat products, such as wheat 
breakfast cereals, in which the proportion of wheat 
is large. 

II. FULL ALLOWANCE WITH VARIETY 

The full allowance of wheat flour is I Yl pounds 
per person per week, including w^heat flour in Vic- 
tory bread and all other wheat products in any 
form. 

This may include I 54 pounds of Victory bread, 
which uses one pound of wheat flour, leaving one- 
half pound a week of other wheat products, to be 
eaten as macaroni or breakfast food, or used in 
making pastry, cake, and incidental cooking. 

Victory bread must contain at least 25 per cent, 
of wheat substitutes, but the housewife can use 
50 per cent, successfully.

VICTORY BREADS 

This name may be given to any bread which contains at least 25 per cent* 
of some wheat flour substitute. Satisfactory and palatable yeast breads may be 
made containing 50 per cent substitutes. Whenever this can be increased it should 
be done. Since I 00 per cent substitutes may be used for quick breads, these should 
largely replace yeast breads while the shortage of w^heat continues. 

In making bread such substitutes should be chosen as are most available in 
the particuler locality. If yeast bread is to be made, a bread recipe in common use, 
and the kind of yeast that is familiar, should be chosen. 

Each locality has different substitutes for wheat. At least part of the sub- 
stitutes used should be cereals that are easily available, though it is sometimes 
worth while to use one to help create a demand even though it cannot be had in 
abundance at the time. 

In general, wheat flour may be replaced by an equal weight of any substi- 
tute flour. The comparative weights of several such flours are given. 

COMPARATIVE WEIGHT AND MEASURE

From various experiments it was at first thought 
that in yeast breads not more than one-quarter of 
the wheat flour could be satisfactorily replaced by 
substitute flours without materially changing the 
lightness and palatability of the loaf. Work in the 
experimental kitchen of the Home Conservation 
Division of the Food Administration has shown 
that a 50 Or substitution may be made if the method 
is slightly modified, or perhaps a still greater one.

tute on the 1 to 4 basis (i. e. three-quarter 
of the w^eight of the potato is reckoned as 
water). 

2. A sponge is made of the substitute flour in- 

stead of the w^hite flour. 

3. The dough is made much stiffer than ordin- 

ary bread dough. 
The recipe given will make an I 8 to 19 oz. loaf.

^ cup (6 oz.) mashed potato 

1 tablespoon syrup 

I teaspoon salt 

1 teaspoon fat 

1 cup {4^/4 oz.) ground oats 

I J/2 cups (6 oz.) wheat flour 

Directions: Make a sponge of the liquid, yeast, 
syrup, mashed potato and enough of the ground 
oats to make a batter. Allow to rise until light 
(about one hour) and then add the salt, fat and 
remainder of the oats and the flour. The dough 
must be much stiffer than ordinary bread dough. 

Knead thoroughly and allow to rinse until double 
in bulk. Knead, mold into a loaf, and when double 
in bulk, bake 50 minutes to one hour. Begin in a 
moderately hot oven (400^ F.). After 15 to 20 
minutes, lower the temperature slightly (to 390^ 
F.) and finish baking.

WHEAT FOR LIBERTY 

UNITED STATES FOOD ADMINISTRATION 
The only question for every true-hearted American to-day is: "What can 
I do to help win the war?" The only answ^er — "Give instantly the service needed." 

"That service now^ is until the next harvest for you to share your w^heat 
with your comrades across the sea — for you w^ho can afford it to give your whole 
share to them." 



WHEAT IS NOW A LUXURY FOR INVALIDS, BABIES AND THE 

VERY POOR 

It Is Not Now Fit Food for Strong Men and Women 
Autocracy compels, and gives no reasons. 
Democracy requests, and gives reasons. 
Are you ready for Democracy? 

The allied countries of Europe lack w^heat because: Belgium, formerly 
strong, splendid and free, has America only to look to for daily bread; England 
formerly imported her wheat from South America and Australia as w^ell as from 
North America; France and Italy have lost to the army the majority of their farm- 
ers; their w^omen are needed in munition factories and in other civil occupations. 
Fertilizers and farming tools are lacking. 



SUPPLEMENT— WHEAT FOR LIBERTY 



5-27 



The allied countries of Europe need wheat because: Bread has been one of 
the chief sources of nourishment. Bakeries cannot make raised bread without 
wheat flour — French homes in particular depend on bakeries; fuel and time are 
lacking. ' One bakery can supply hundreds of families and so release hundreds of 
pounds of coal, hundreds of hours of time. If we insist upon eating wheat needed 
abroad, Liberty's armies and Liberty's civil population will collapse as Russia col- 
lapsed, because the food supplies of her armies and her civil population failed. 

Citizens of America, it is bad enough to have those countries across the 
seas bear the brunt of all the fighting. It is impossible to believe that with the facts 
before us, there is a living man or woman who will permit those countries to starve 
for us also. In old times the Prophets would have cursed the bread so eaten. It 
needs no Prophet now to say that there is a curse for anyone who in mere gratifica- 
tion of appetite eats wheaten bread, and that curse proclaims him a traitor to him- 
self and to his country. 

Enough has been said and written. The one who does not now understand 
the situation is an ignoramus or a slacker; the ignoramus can't and the slacker won't 
understand. The real pure-bred American from now on needs only the briefest 
message from one whom he trusts. 



BROTHER, YOUR COMRADES NEED WHEAT 

The Food Administrator for America has said, 
"My message is small and concrete, the service 
that we ask of you, that we ask of every well-to- 
do, every independent person in the United States 
to-day is that he shall abstain from the use of 
wheat in any form until the next harvest."

WHEATLESS BREADS AND CAKES 

UNITED STATES FOOD LEAFLET NO. 20 



SAVE THE WHEAT FOR VICTORY 

Our soldiers and those of the Allies who are 
fighting in France must have bread. America 
must send them wheat. Every American has a 
chance to help. We must use one-half or even 
less of the usual amount of wheat if our soldiers 
are to have the bread they need. 

To Save the Wheat Use the Wheat Substitutes. 
Corn meal, rolled oats, rice, and buckwheat — these 
are usually found everywhere. Besides you can 
now get barley flour, ground oats, corn flour, rice 
flour, and potato flour in many markets. In some 
places peanut flour, sweet potato meal, soy bean 
flour, kafSr, milo, and feterita meal can be ob- 
tained for use. Choose the ones easiest to get in 
your neighborhood and use them in place of wheat. 

Whole wheat and graham flour, macaroni, and 
the wheat breakfast foods should be saved just the 
same as white flour. We are also asked to save 
rye. 

Use Quick Breads. American people have always 
used and liked quick breads. Try the wheat sub- 
stitutes for making them. They are delicious and 
they can save a great deal of wheat for our soldiers. 

Corn meal is one of the best of the wheat sub- 
stitutes. For its use see U. S. Food Leaflet No. 2. 

QUICK BREADS REQUIRING NO WHEAT 
Barley Biscuits 

Have you ever made barley biscuits? They are 
worth trying. 

2 cups barley flour; 2 tablespoons fat; Yl t^^" 



spoon salt; 4 teaspoons baking powder; 2/3 cup 
milk. 

Sift the dry ingredients together, mix in the fat, 
and add the liquid until a soft dough is formed. 
Roll to about three-fourths inch thick, cut with a 
cooky cutter, and bake in a hot oven. 

This makes a very good dough for shortcake 
also. 

Buckwheat Breakfast Cake 

This is good, if served hot. 

2 cups buckwheat flour; '/^ cup shortening; 2 
cups sour milk; 1 teaspoon soda; Yl teaspoon salt. 

Mix and bake in a flat pan so that the cake is 
about 1 Yi inches thick when done. Cut in squares 
and serve hot like corn bread. 

Waffles or Griddle Cakes 

1 !/2 cups milk; 2 eggs; 2 tablespoons fat; 2 cups 
barley flour; 3 teaspoons baking powder; 1 tea- 
spoon salt. 

Corn flour or half corn flour and half peanut 
flour may be used instead of barley flour. 

Sift the dry ingredients together and add slowly 
the milk, beaten egg yolk, and melted fat. Beat 
thoroughly for a minute and fold in stiffly beaten 
whites. Cook in hot well-greased waffle iron or 
as griddle cakes on a hot w^ell-greased griddle. 

Oats are good for quick breads. Rolled oats 
may be ground through a food chopper and used in 
this form in quick breads or cakes, or ground oats 
may- be bought as such. 

Try these oatmeal and corn-flour muffins:

The yeast bread we do use should be Victory bread. 
The bakers of this country are now making this 
Victory bread which contains 25 per cent, of wheat 
substitutes, just as the bakers m France and Eng- 
land are using wheat substitutes in their yeast 
bread. Waste none of the bread, for all products 
containing wheat are precious. 

Loaf bread that can be sliced and served cold 
or toasted is often wanted. Try this conservation 
loaf. 

Oat and Corn-Flour Bread 
Two cups rolled oats (ground); 2/3 cup corn 
flour; 4 teaspoons baking powder; I teaspoon salt; 
y^ cup milk; 2 eggs; 4 tablespoons corn syrup; 2 
tablespoons melted fat. 

Mix the melted fat, liquid, syrup and egg. Add 
the well-n>ixed dry ingredients. Bake as a loaf 
in a moderately hot oven for one hour or longer. 
Nuts or raisins may be added, if desired. 

Quick Breads for Americans. Victory bread 
saves wheat flour, but we can save more by making 
quick breads, which require no wheat. Let Amer- 
icans use them now for the Cause of Liberty. We 
cannot ask the women of France, many of whom 
are working twelve or fourteen hours a day in 
the field or factory, to make these breads. They 
are not accustomed to them and have no ovens 
in their homes for baking. Even in the little 
country towns they buy all their bread from the 
baker, and the bakeries are not equipped to make 
such breads. We cannot ask the men in the 
trenches to use the quick breads either, for all 



their bread must be baked by army bakers in the 
bakeries back of the lines. 

It is our duty to use quick breads here in Amer- 
ica, where we know how to make them and have 
facilities for baking them. Remember when you 
take the extra trouble to make a quick bread for a 
meal you help to make it possible for the soldier 
in the trench or the French woman who is doing 
a man's work "over there" to have a loaf of bread. 

WHEATLESS CAKE AND PASTRY 

Very good cake and pastry can be made from 
the wheat substitutes. 

Pastry 

2 cups barley flour; 1/3 cup fat; 1 teaspoon salt; 
Water to make a stiff dough. 

Combine as for other pastry. 

Chocolate Cake 

This is a true conservation cake, for it saves 
sugar as well as wheat. 

j/^ cup fat; 3 tablespoons brown sugar; 2 eggs; 
1 cup corn syrup; 2 squares chocolate (melted); 
Yl eup milk; 2 cups barley flour; 4 teaspoons bak- 
ing powder; '/4 teaspoon salt; 1 teaspoon vanilla. 

Cream the fat and sugar, add the egg yolks, 
syrup, and melted chocolate, and beat well. Sift 
the dry ingredients together and add alternately 
with the milk. Add vanilla and fold in the stiffly 
beaten whites. Bake in loaf or layers in a moder- 
ate oven. 

OTHER WAYS TO SAVE WHEAT 

Cut your loaf at the table slice by slice as needed. 
Waste not a crumb. 

Waste no flour on the bread board when you 
make bread. 

For thickening — Use cornstarch or the substi- 
tute flours. Fine corn meal is good for dredging 
meats. Every little bit of flour saved counts. 

Have breadless meals Eat potatoes or cooked 

cereals to take the place of bread. When you have 
potatoes, rice, or hominy served with meat, or for 
breakfast a large bo^vl of cereal, you do not need 
bread.

SAVE SUGAR 

UNITED STATES FOOD LEAFLET NO. IS 

USE OTHER SWEETS 

The Allies need sugar. The battle lines and enemy territory now include 
much of their sugar land, so that more and more they are turning to us and our 
sources of supply. We must give them what they need. 

To help them we must cut down our ow^n consumption, otherwise there 
will not be enough sugar for us all. We, in the past, have used more than any 
other people. The French and Italians allow^ themselves only one-fourth pound a 
w^eek. We eat at least one pound — four times as much. 

To divide the w^orld's sugar more evenly is a w^orld problem that all of us 
can help solve. Let us do our part. We are asked merely to cut down our sugar 
from one pound to three-fourths of a pound. By this saving we can help win the 
war. 



HOW TO SAVE SUGAR 
Eat less sweet food. Put less sugar in tea and 
coffee and dissolve completely -what you do use. 
Use less on cereals. Do not frost cakes. Eat less 
candy. 

Instead of sugar use Cane, corn, and maple 

syrups, honey, molasses, and fruit syrups. To 
sweeten your cereals serve them with syrup or with 
sweet fruits. Use them to make delicious desserts 
— honey or corn syrup for a delicate flavor, and 
molasses or sorghum for a stronger one. Try 
molasses or syrup in Indian Pudding and Brown 
Pudding. (See Leaflets 2 and 6.) 

DATE PUDDING 

A sugarless pudding which uses both syrup 

and sweet fruit 

2 cups milk; Yi cup corn or malpe syrup; 12 
seeded dates cut up small; 3 tablespoons corn- 
starch; Yl teaspoon salt; I teaspoon vanilla. 

Mix the cornstarch with Ya cup milk. Heat the 
remaining milk in a double boiler. Add the corn- 
starch, syrup, dates, and salt, and stir until thick, 
cover and cook for 20 minutes. Add the vanilla 
and pour into a dish to cool. Serves five people. 
Prunes are good instead of dates. 

GINGERBREAD 
Always liked and inexpensive 

1 cup cornmeal; I cup wheat flour; 2 teaspoons 
cinnamon; 2 teaspoons ginger; Yl teaspoon salt; 
1 teaspoon baking powder; I teaspoon baking soda; 
1 cup molasses; 1 cup sour milk or buttermilk; 2 
tablespoons fat. 

Sift the dry ingredients and add molasses, milk, 
and fat. Beat well and pour into a greased pan. 
Bake 25 minutes. Notice that this recipe uses 
cornmeal for half the wheat flour ordinarily used. 



CAKE WITHOUT SUGAR 

An excellent cake, though not quite so s\reet 

as with sugar 

Y4 cup butter, oleomargarine or other fat; 2 cups 
corn syrup; 2 eggs; 3 cups flour; 1 j/2 tablespoons 
baking powder; Ya teaspoon salt; I cup milk. 

Cream the shortening, add the syrup and the 
egg, and mix well. Add the milk. Sift the baking 
powder and flour together, add it slowly to the 
mixture and beat. Bake in a moderate oven as a 
loaf or layer cake or small drop cakes. One- 
fourth cup of raisins added to the batter gives more 
flavor and sweetness. 

POPCORN 
A splendid substitute for sugar sweets 

Pop the dried corn in a regular popper or a 
covered iron frying pan, shaking vigorously and 
taking care not to let it burn. A cup of dried 
corn will make 3 quarts when popped, it is good 
mixed with a little salt or melted butter and salt. 

To make a sweet of it, combine with syrup. Boil 
together I cup corn syrup and I tablespoon vinegar 
until a few drops harden in water. Pour over the 
popped corn while the syrup is hot. This amount 
of syrup will cover 3 quarts of popped corn. As 
soon as the mass is cool enough to handle, grease 
the hands well and form into balls. 

STUFFED PRUNES AND DATES 
Delicious confections to use instead of candy 

Soak the prunes overnight, dry, and stuff with 
chopped nuts, raisins, or apricots. Wash the dates, 
dry them, and stuff the same as prunes. These 
and the Parisian Sweets are good to eat and good 
for you. 



SUPPLEMENT— SAVE SUGAR 



S-33 



PARISIAN SWEETS 

Another sweet which is very good 

Use equal quantities of figs, dates and nuts. The 

nuts may be omitted and prunes or raisins added. 

Put through a food chopper. Mix well and roll 

in a little powdered sugar or grated cocoanut. 

FRUIT FOR DESSERT 

Raw, stewed, or baked fruits, dried or fresh, and 
dried sweet fruits like dates, figs, and raisins. By 
using fruit for dessert instead of rich pies and pud- 
dings you will conserve wheat flour and fats as 
well as sugar. Besides, the fruits are more whole- 
some and often less expensive. Bake or stew your 
fruit with corn syrup instead of sugar. The result 
is very good. For stewing use Yl cup of syrup to 
1 pound of fruit. When dried fruit is used, soak 
it first in water overnight and cook for 10 minutes. 

IS YOUR FAMILY SAVING ITS SHARE 
OF SUGAR? 

Plan saving for your household. Use no more 
than three-fourths pounds a week for each mem- 
ber. Multiply three-fourths pound by the number 
of people in your family and put that quantity 
aside for the week's use. That should include all 
the sugar you use in cookery and on the table. 
Eat less candy. Follow these suggestions and 
recipes and help the Allies in their great need.

USE SAVORY STEWS AND MEAT PIES 

Do you know how good they are? They may be so varied that you can 
have a different one every day in the week, and all of them delicious. It needs 
only a small piece of meat to give flavor to a hearty dish. 

??"'* *'■''"'' ^^^^ ^°" "^"^* ^^* ^ '°' °^ ^^^^ ^° ^^ strong. Meat is good to 
help build up the body, but so are many other foods. 

In these dishes part of your building material comes from the more expen- 
sive meat and part from the cheaper peas, beans, hominy, and barley. The little 
meat with the vegetables and cereals will give the body what it needs. 



SAVORY STEWS 

Try them. They can be a whole meal and a 
nutritious one. These recipes serve five people. 
Here is an English stew that is especially good: 

HOT POT OF MUTTON AND BARLEY 

1 pound mutton; Yi cup pearled barley; I table- 
spoon salt; 4 potatoes; 3 onions; Celery tops or 
other seasoning herbs. 



Cut the mutton in small pieces, and brown with 
the onion in fat cut from meat. This will help make 
the meat tender and improves the flavor. Pour 
this into a covered saucepan. Add 2 quarts water 
and the barley. Simmer for I Yl hours. Then add 
the potatoes cut in quarters, seasoning herbs, and 
seasoning, anti took one-half hour longer. 



S-34 



THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— SUPPLEMENT 



SAVORY STEWS AND MEAT PIES 
BEEF STEW 

I pound beef; 4 potatoes cut in quarters; Y^ peck 
peas or 1 can; 1 cup carrots cut up small; 1 tea- 
spoon salt. 

Cut the meat in small pieces and brown in the 
fat from the meat. Simmer in 2 quarts of water 
for 1 hour. Add the peas and carrots and cook for 
one-half hour, then add the potatoes. If canned 
peas are used, add them 1 minutes before serving. 
Serve when potatoes are done. 

DIFFERENT STEWS 

Here is the way you can change the stews to 
make them different and to suit the season: 

1 . The meat. This may be any kind and more 

or less than a pound may be used. Use the cheap 
cuts, the flank, rump, neck, or brisket. The long, 
slov^r cooking makes them tender. Game and 
poultry are good. 

2. Potatoes and barley may be used or barley 
alone, or rice, hominy, or macaroni. 

3. Vegetables. — Carrots, turnips, onions, peas, 
beans, cabbage, tomatoes are good, canned or 
fresh. Use one or more of these, as you wish. 

4. Parsley, celery tops, onion tops, seasoning 
herbs, or chopped sw^eet peppers add to the flavor. 

5. Many left-overs may be used — not only meat 
and vegetables, but rice or hominy. 

HOW TO COOK THE STEWS 

All kinds of stews are cooked in just about the 
same way. Here are directions which vyrill serve 
for making almost any kind. 

Cut the meat in small pieces and brown with 
the onion in the fat cut from the meat. Add the 
salt and pepper, seasoning vegetables (onion, celery 
tops, etc.), 2 quarts of water, and the rice, or 
other cereal, if it is to be used. Cook for an hour, 



(Paste or Write Here 
Scraps or Memos.

then add the vegetables except potatoes. Cook 
the stew for half an hour, add the potatoes cut in 
quarters, cook for another half an hour, and serve. 

The fireless cooker may well be used, the meat 
and the vegetables being put in at the same time. 

Left-overs or canned vegetables need only to be 
heated through. Add them 1 5 minutes before 
serving. 

Dried peas or beans should be soaked over night 
and cooked for 3 hours before adding to the 
stew; or, better, cook them over night in a fireless 
cooker. 

THE BEST WAY TO MAKE A LITTLE MEAT 
GO A LONG WAY 

MEAT PIES 
Another good way to use a little meat. Have 
you ever used rice, corn meal mush, or hominy fo 



Drk than a pastry crust am 



A 



a crust? This is less 
saves wheat. 

4 cups cooked corn meal, rice, or hominy; 1 
onion; 2 cups tomato; Y& teaspoon pepper; 1 table- 
spoon fat; 1 pound raw meat or left-over meat cut 
up small; Yi teaspoon salt. 

Melt the fat, add the sliced onion, and, if rayi 
meat is used, add it and stir until the red colo 
disappears. Add the tomato and seasoning. H 
cooked meat is used, add it with the tomato and 
seasoning, after the onion is browned, and heat 
through. Grease a baking dish, put in a layer of 
the cereal, add the meat and gravy, and cover with 
the cereal dotted with fat. Bake for half an hour.

THE FISH SITUATION 

UNITED STATES FOOD ADMINISTRATION 

May 11, 1918. 

Extreme shortage in supplies of salt water fish on the Atlantic seaboard 
during the winter and early spring months has largely been remedied, the United 
States Food Administration has announced. The shortage has been due to the 
necessary taking over of trawlers for naval purposes and the recruiting of deep- 
sea fishermen by the Navy. The trawler production of deep-sea fish has now 
been materially increased by free admission of Canadian trawlers and new con- 
struction. Beyond this, certain State restrictions on littoral fishing have been 
lifted. 

Supplies are being rapidly augmented. While the runs of migratory shore 
fish did not begin until late in the Fall and maximum catches of the different vari- 
eties was not felt until the latter part of May, wholesale prices quite generally are 
already down to relatively low levels, and should remain on this basis except when 
storms and climatic changes in the various districts bring about temporary short- 
ages. 

On every day in each week and continuously during the present season from May to December, 
some of the many varieties of salt water fish will be available and sold in the wholesale markets along 
the Atlantic Coast at prices ranging from four to six cents per pound. In view of these conditions, all 
retailers in the large cities along the Atlantic Coast and in the towns and cities of the interior, within 
reachable transportation distance from the Atlantic seaboard, will be able to sell every weekday at least 
one variety of fish at a retail price to consumers of ten cents per pound or under. Any retail dealer 
who does not conform to these conditions and offer at least one kind of fish to the public at the max- 
imum retail price mentioned is not patriotically co-operating with the Food Administration and his cus- 
tomers. 

The particular variety sold by the retailer on this ten-cent basis must necessarily vary from day 
to day with the available supplies. Fish now available on the low-priced basis include market cod, 
scrod cod, scrod haddock, haddock, medium hake, skate wings, grayfish, ling, flounders, shad herring, 
herring, whiting, croakers, butterfish (small), spotted trout (small) , weakfish (small), small shad (known 
as jacks or skips), tinker mackerel, squid, small Boston mackerel, drum, menhaden, shark, sea robins, 
spots. Others will be added as the runs of the shore varieties strike on through the different Atlantic 
Coast districts in heavier volumes. 

The country was threatened with what amounted to a practical fish famine during the winter. 
The shortage arose fundamentally from the necessities of the Navy in requisitioning deep-sea trawlers 
and other fishing vessels and in recruiting fishermen for naval service. How important this has been 
may be seen from the fact that the trawler capacity supplying the New England districts was decreased 
last summer from an annual capacity of approximately sixty million pounds to thirty-five million pounds. 

A substantial number of new trawlers are now on the ways and approaching completion. Owing 
to the action of Secretary Redfield in opening up our fishing ports to Canadian vessels, several Canadian 
trawlers are now fishing to our markets. There is every prospect of acquiring trawlers from the Scandi- 
navian fisheries for use in this country. In the meantime, the relaxation of State regulations that have 
been effected by the Food Administration should tend to increase greatly the production of the shore 
fisheries, and its reflex will be steadily shown in the wholesale prices of fish as the season progresses. 

With the approach of next winter, the Food Administration is confident the deep-sea fishing and 
the winter production of ground fish through the various sources indicated should be restored to normal.

WHEATLESS RECIPES 

UNITED STATES FOOD ADMINISTRATION 

Tested in the Experimental Kitchen of the Food Administration (Conservation 
Division) and the Department of Agriculture 

Washington, April, 1918. 

BAKING POWDER LOAF BREADS 
(Using no Wheat) 

All MeasuremenU Are Level. — In the following recipes the weights given are accurate. The 
measurements are approximate; that is, they are given in the nearest fraction of a cup which a housewife 
ordinarily uses. It is convenient to remember in measuring unusual fractions that two level tablespoons 
are one-eighth cup. 

METHOD 

Mix the melted fat, liquid, syrup, and egg. Combine the liquid and well mixed dry ingredients. 
Bake as a loaf in a moderately hot oven (203° C. or 400° F.) for one hour or until thoroughly baked. 
Nuts, raisins, or dates may be added, making the breads more nutritious and very palatable.

\y^ cups (5 ounces) barley flour. I J/2 cups (5 ounces) ground rolled oats. 

COMBINATION MUFFINS 

, (Using no Wheat) 

METHOD OF MIXING 

Add to the cup of milk the melted fat, syrup, and slightly beaten egg; sift the salt, baking powder 
and flour together. Use a coarse sieve so that no part of the flour is wasted. Combine the two mixtures, 
stirring lightly without beating. Bake in a hot oven (427° F. or 225° C.) for 20 to 30 minutes, de- 
pending upon the size of the mucins. 

These recipes make 24 small muffins (3 of which make a 2-ounce serving) or 8 very large muffins. 

The ground rolled oats are the same as rolled oats ground in a food chopper. When using oats, 
mix them with the other sifted dry ingredients. 

When cornmeal is used, mix do not sift the ingredients. 

Suggestions. — The wheat substitute recipes given below show that a wide variety of combinations 
is possible even when limited to the use of a few substitutes. 

All of the combinations are good. In nearly all cases a combination of substitutes makes a better 
product than the use of only one substitute. 

Muffins containing oats have a particularly pleasant flavor. 

Other substitutes used with buckwheat will modify the color and improve the flavor of the product. 
The use of molasses will also do this.

Use a coarse sifter or mix instead of sifting if the flours are coarse, so that none is wasted. 

Biscuits made of the substitutes are less like the normal wheat flour product, particularly in texture, 
than are the muffins, loaf breads, and cakes. 

If one-fourth more liquid is used, a drop biscuit having better texture is the result.

USE BARLEY SAVE WHEAT 

UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE 
THE STATES RELATIONS SERVICE 



Washington, April 18, 1918. 

Barley is grown in large quantities in the United States and it is now being 
ground into flour, though until lately it was more generally used for other purposes, 
it is a palatable, wholesome grain which has long been used in infant feeding and, 
to some extent, for general cookery, and which can now be used in quantity to 
save wheat. You will find barley flour one of the best of the wheat substitutes. 
Delicious breads and cakes can be made by using it to replace all or part of the 
wheat flour. 

The use of barley flour for such purposes, though new to most of us, is 
not new to some people. Not many years ago barley was used more extensively 
than wheat for bread making in many of the European countries. Let us revive 
the art of barley cookery and, by so doing, "stretch" our supply of wheat flour so 
that it may go farther to meet the needs of our Allies. We can easily do this and 
at the same time serve our families with delicious bread, muffins, biscuit, and 
pastry. 



USE BARLEY — SAVE WHEAT 

Hundreds of millions of bushels of barley are 
raised yearly in the United States. This supply, 
heretofore, has been used chiefly for stock feed or 
for malting, but under present conditions the 
greater part of the crop is being milled into flour, 
which, since it is both palatable and nutritious, may 
well be used to meet the increasing demand for 
wheat substitutes. This flour is now on the mar- 
ket, and it is our patriotic duty to use it to save 
the wheat flour. 

Give barley flour a trial you will wonder why 

we did not use it more before the war. 

Barley flour does not keep so well as wheat 
flour, so it is best to buy it in small quaiitities, even 
for home consumption. 

The recipes which follow have been tested in 
the experimental kitchen of the Office of Home 
Economics. 

Note — All measures are level. 

HOT BREADS 

Barley flour is very satisfactory for hot breads. 

BARLEY QUICK BISCUITS 

Two cups barley flour, Yl teaspoon salt, 2 table- 
spoons fat, 4 teaspoons baking powder, 2/3 cup 
milk. 

BARLEY DROP BISCUITS 

Two cups barley flour, I/2 teaspoon salt, 4 table- 
spoons fat, 6 teaspoons baking powder, 1 cup milk. 

Baked in a sheet this makes a good shortcake 
buttered and served with fresh crushed berries or 
other fruit. 



BARLEY WAFFLES 

Two cups barley flour, 1 teaspoon salt, 3 tea- 
spoons baking powder, 1 Yi cups milk, 2 eggs, 3 
tablespoons melted fat. 

Sift the dry ingredients together and add slowly 
the milk, beaten egg yolk, and melted fat. Fold 
in stiffly beaten whites. Beat thoroughly and cook 
in hot, well-greased waffle irons. 

BARLEY MUFFINS 

Two and three-quarter cups barley flour, \ cup 
milk, 2 tablespoons corn syrup, 4 teaspoons baking 
powder, I tablespoon fat, 1 egg, Ya teaspoon salt. 

BARLEY SPOON BREAD 

One cup barley flour, 1 cup hot boiled hominy 
grits, 3 tablespoons fat, I teaspoon salt, 2 cups 
milk, 2 eggs, 2 teaspoons baking powder. 

BARLEY YEAST BREAD 

If you use you own bread recipe and replace 
one-fourth of the wheat flour with barley flour, 
you will be able to make a very good bread. With 
the present need of saving flour, it will be desirable 
for the housekeeper to make less yeast bread than 
usual, as one cannot use so large a percentage of 
wheat substitute in making yeast breads as in quick 
breads. 

BARLEY PASTRY 

Very good pie crust can be made with all-barley 
flour or by using one-half barley and one-half 
wheat flour. The first recipe is especially good 
for a one-crust pie.

THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— SUPPLEMENT 



PlE CRUST 

One cup barley flour, 2 2/3 tablespoons fat, 
l/g teaspoon salt, cold water. 

CAKES AND COOKIES 

It is not necessary to go without cake when 
such delicious products can be made that use no 
wheat flour and little sugar. In these recipes the 
housekeeper, if she prefers, can use cream of tartar 
with baking soda in the usual proportions in place 
of baking powder. 

CHOCOLATE CAKE 

Two cups barley flour, J4 C"P f^*- !4 teaspoon 
salt, 2 .squares chocolate, Yi cup milk, 4 teaspoons 
baking powder, 3 tablespoons brown sugar, I cup 
corn syrup, 2 eggs, whites and yolks, beaten separ- 
ately, 1 teaspoon vanilla. 

SPONGE CAKE 

One and one-half cups barley flour, 4 eggs, 1 
tablespoon lemon juice, 1 Yi cups corn syrup, !4 
teaspoon salt, 2 teaspoons baking powder. 

FRUIT CAKE 

Two and one-quarter cups barley flour, '/t cup 



fat, 3 tablespoons molasses, Yl cup chopped raisins, 
1/4 teaspoon cinnamon, Yl cup chopped nuts, Yl 
cup corn syrup, |/4 teaspoon soda, 1 teaspoon bak- 
ing powder, '/^ teaspoon allspice, Yi teaspoon 
cloves, Y& cup citron. 

Bake 1 hour and 1 minutes. Keep moist and 
very good. 

GINGERBREAD 

One and one-half cups barley flour, Yl cup 
molasses, Yl cup milk, 2 teaspoons baking powder, 
Y4 teaspoon soda, I teaspoon ginger, 1 teaspoon 
cinnamon, '/g teaspoon salt, 2 tablespoons fat. 

Bake about 30 minutes in moderate oven. Good 
texture and flavor. 

HERMITS 

Two cups barley flour, 2 tablespoons fat, I egg, 
Yz teaspoon ginger, Ya cup chopped raisins, 1 tea- 
spoon baking powder, Yl cup corn syrup, J/^ tea- 
spoon salt, Yl teaspoon cinnamon, Y4 cup nuts, 
1 tablespoon milk. 

Honey, maple sugar, or maple, beet, apple, or 
sorghum syrup, which can be made at home, can 
be used in the same way as corn syrup in the 
above recipes to save sugar. 



SUGAR SAVING 



Because of the present shortage of sugar it is 
necessary for each person to reduce his consump- 
tion of sugar to % pound per week. There are 
so many sweet foods that may be used in place or 
sugar that this should be no hardship. 
Cut out candy. 

Use less sugar in tea and coffee and substitute 
other sweetening wherever possible. 

Try cooking breakfast cereals with chopped figs, 
dates or raisins. You will not need to add any 
sugar at the table. 

Use molasses, honey, corn or other syrups for 
sweetening. 

*Apple syrup and concentrated cider. 
Get Government pamphlet giving directions for 
making syrup from apples and other fruits. Try 
some of these. 

Use fresh fruits for desserts in place of rich pas- 
tries and sw^eet puddings. 

Bake apples or pears w^ith a little water for sev- 
eral hours until a rich syrup forms. 

If more sw^eetening is desired add a little honey 



or molasses. 

Stew dried prunes in the water in which they 
were soaked until the liquid is almost all boiled 
away. If more juice is w^anted add water to the 
syrup. The long, slow cooking is necessary to 
develop a rich flavor. 

Cut dow^n the use of cake. 

Do not use frosting unless you can make it with- 
out sugar. 

Either honey or maple syrup can be substituted 
for sugar in a boiled frosting. 

When cake is made it should be not only wheat- 
saving, but sugar-saving and fat-saving. Try mak- 
ing cakes in which cornmeal, corn flour, rye flour, 
potato flour, rice flour or cornstarch is substituted 
for part of the wheat flour. 

Use corn syrup, molasses, honey and others 
syrups for part or all of the sugar. 

A good working rule in making such substitution 
is to use I cupful of syrup as equivalent to I cup 
ful of sugar and ]/^ cup of liquid. Corn syrup 
does not sweeten as much as molasses or honey. 



CONSERVATION PIE CRUSTS 



CORNMEAL CRUST 

Grease a pie plate well. Cover with raw corn- 
meal, giving the plate a rotating motion so that 
an even layer of the meal will stick to the plate 
about 1/16 of an inch in thickness. Fill the plate 
with pumpkin pie mixture. Bake in a hot oven. 



'Department of Agriculture Yearbook Separate 
639. 



OATMEAL CRUST 

Two cupfuls finely ground oatmeal, 1 cupful 
boiling water, I teaspoonful fat. 

Scald the oatmeal with the water. Add fat and 
mix thoroughly. Roll very thin and line small pie 
or tart tins with the mixture. Bake in a hot oven. 
Fill with apricot marmalade or other thick mixture. 
If desired, spread a meringue on top and brown 
in the oven.

cipe. This ^vill have the characteristic flavor of 
buckwheat. If it is too strong use only 1 cupful 
of buckwheat and 1 J/g cupfuls of white flour. Two 
and a half cupfuls of rye flour may also be substi- 
tuted. 



*Omitted if desired. 



MEAT SAVING 



Meat saving is to be accomplished in various 
ways: 

I . By doing without pork and beef. 

2 . By using meat less frequently. 

3. By serving smaller portions. 

4. By using meat extenders, such as a dish of 
rice, tomatoes and a little meat. 

5. By using substitutes, such as cheese, eggs, 
fish, game, poultry, dried beans and peas. 

MEAT EXTENDERS 
TAMALE PIE (Serves 6) 

Two cupfuls cornmeal, 2!/2 teaspoonfuls salt, 
6 cupfuls boiling water, I onion, I tablespoonful 
fat, I pound Hamburger steak, 2 cupfuls toma- 
toes, J/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper or I small 
chopped sweet pepper, 1 teaspoonful salt. 

Make a mush by stirring the cornmeal and I J/2 
teaspoonfuls salt into boiling water. Cook in a 
double boiler or over water for 45 minutes. Brown 
th« onion in the fat, add the Hamburger steak and 
stir until the red color disappears. Add the to- 
mato, pepper and salt. Grease a baking dish, put 
in a layer of cornmeal mush, add the seasoned 
meat, and cover with mush. Bake 30 minutes. 



BEEF STEW 

One pound beef, 4 potatoes cut in quarters, J4 
peck green peas or I can, I cupful carrots cut up 
small, I teaspoonful salt. 

Cut meat in small pieces and brown in the fat 
from the meat. Simmer in 2 quarts of water for 
I hour. Add the peas and carrots and cook for 
half an hour, then add the potatoes. If canned 
peas are used, add them 1 minutes before serv- 
ing. Serve when potatoes are done. 

Variations 

1 . The Meat — This may be any kind and more 
or less than a pound may be used. Use the cheap 
cuts, the flank, rump, neck or brisket. The long, 
slow cooking makes them tender. Came and poul- 
try are good. 

2. Potatoes and barley may be used or barley 
alone, or rice, hominy or macaroni. 

3. Vegetables — Carrots, turnips, onions, peas, 
beans, cabbage, tomatoes are good, canned or 
fresh. Use one or more of these, as you wish. 

4. Parsley, celery tops, onion tops, seasoning 
herbs, or chopped sweet peppers add to the flavor. 

5. Many left-overs may be used — not only meat 
and vegetables, but rice and hominy.

used in place of cottage cheese. 

The amount of liquid added will vary in each 
case. The seasoning may be varied to suit the 
case. J 

SAUCES ' 

Especial attention must be given to seasoning 
of dishes ^vhich have as their foundation beans, 
rice or other foods having little flavor of their 
own. 

Use peppers, onions, garlic, leek, celery, catsup, 
Worcestershire sauce, etc., for increasing flavor. 
Bean and nut loaves should be served with highly 
seasoned sauces.

ITALIAN TOMATO SAUCE 

Two cupfuU cooked tomatoes, Yl cip finely 
cut onion, Yz c"P grated or cut turnip, Yl "^"P 
grated or cut carrot, 2 teaspoonfuU salt, I cup 
cut green peppers, 4 tablespoonfuls butter substi- 
tute or vegetable drippings, 2 tablespoonfuls rice 
flour. 

Cook vegetables (except tomato) in the fat un- 
til tender. Add tomato and salt, cook 5 minutes. 
Put through strainer, return to fire, add flour 
mixed with 2 tablespoonfuls cold water, boil 5 
minutes. 

PIMENTO SAUCE 

Force canned pimento through a strainer. Add 
Yl cup of this puree to 1 cupful of white sauce. 

BROWN NUT SAUCE 

Two tablespoonfuls drippings or vegetable oil, 
2 tablespoonfuls peanut butter, 3 [/2 tablespoonfuls 
flour, 1 Yl cupfuls meat or vegetable stock or milk, 
Yl teaspoon salt, few grains of pepper. 

Brown the fat, add peanut butter, and when well 
mixed add flour and continue browning. Pour in 
the stock gradually, stirring constantly. Bring to 
the boiling point and add salt and pepper. 



FAT SAVING 

We use twice as much fat as some of our Allies. 

The amount used here should be not more than 
y^ pound per person per week and 6 ounces for 
children under ten. 

Butter may be used freely on the table. 

Peanut butter, jellies, or a nut and fig paste are 
excellent substitutes. 

Use little pastry. 

When you do make pies, use one crust instead 
of two. 

Try the New England deep apple pie, with only 
a top crust. 

Vegetable fats may be used in making the 
pastry. 

If vegetable oils are used, the quantity of fat 
may be reduced by one-third; that is, 2J4 table- 
spoonfuls of oil to I cupful of flour is sufficient. 
The oil itself helps to moisten the flour, so that 
very little water is necessary. The dough should 
be made as dry as possible to make a tender pas- 
try. 

Do not fry in deep fat. 

Bake croquettes in the oven. 

Make meat-loaf instead of meat croquettes. 

Either do not use recipes calling for a large 
quantity of fat or try reducing the amount.

PRINCIPLE OF SUBSTITUTING 

The recipes wrhich have been worked out on 
the principle that a given weight of wheat Hour 
may be replaced by an equal weight of substitute 
have been repeated a number of times by the 
laboratory workers in the experimental laboratory 
kitchen, and have also been tried out by a number 

of different people housekeepers, children in 

cooking schools and others — who have found that 



( — ) Indicates a scant measure. 

WEIGHT FOR WEIGHT 

they worked very satisfactorily. There is no ques- 
tion that the weight for weight substitution pro- 
duces good results; this does not mean that other 
methods of substitution may not be satisfactory. 
Some of the flours in equal weights may absorb 
more water than others; but whatever other pro- 
portions work, these certainly have been proved. 



BASIS FOR PRESENT STANDARD 

The measures have been calculated on the basis 
of repeated weighings in the experimental kitchen 
in co-operation with the Office of Home Economics 
of the Department of Agriculture, using the flours 
available on the local market. It has been found 
that samples bought at different times have often 
been of different weights. The rolled oats has been 
a good example. The first purchased was ground 
and weighed 136 grams per cup — the last which 
we ground ourselves weighed 98 grams per cup. 

In different parts of the country, also, the 
weights of these flours seem to differ. Requests 
have been sent to a number of co-operating Home 



OF WEIGHTS AND MEASURES 

Economics Departments asking for a report of the 
weight of a standard cup of the materials used in 
their laboratories. When this data has been re- 
ceived and studied some different figures may be 
adopted to represent a general average. 

For the present, we have adopted the modica- 
tion of v^^eights and measures given in the accom- 
panying table, which will be used hereafter in order 
to avoid any confusion or inconsistency. For the 
benefit of those working with them, plus and minus 
signs are used to show that the measures are not 
exact; 8/9 of a cup, for instance, must be trans- 
lated either into 1 cup or 7/8 of a cup, and the 



S-49 



S-50 



THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— SUPPLEMENT 



sign shows which has been done. There is, how^- 
ever, so nauch variation in the size of the measur- 
ing cup, and also so much dijflerence in the ways 
of measuring, that there is no greater error in this 
translation from one fraction to another than is 
bound to occur in any use of measures. 



It must be remembered that measures are not 
accurate, and that more uniform results may be 
secured by w^eighing. 

These recipes have been submitted as a report 
of progress and to fill the immediate need rather 
than as final statements. 



WEIGHTS AND MEASURES COMPARED 



Yet another method of studying food values is 
to be found in a consideration of weight, cost and 
measure. This has been used by wise housekeep- 
ers for some time, but some women have been so 
impressed with the importance of buying by weight 
that they have almost lost sight of the expression 
of this v^eight in terms of measure. Such a com- 
mon commodity as potatoes, of course, is often 
purchased by wreight, but it is very important 
to realize that there are 1 5 pounds of potatoes 
in a peck, and that this same 1 5 pounds also 
represents about 50 medium-sized potatoes. In 
other words, if a housekeeper buys a pound of 
potatoes, she will get three medium-sized potatoes 
and a little one thrown in for full weight. A pound 
of prunes may be ordered without any special 
interest by the woman buyer, and she may get 
either large or small prunes, depending upon the 
grocer s wishes, while a wise buyer would stipu- 
late the size ■wanted, because she would know that 
in a pound of small prunes she would get about 40 
prunes, while if they were large there would be 
about 28. 



The follovfing table shows the relation of weight 
and measure, and also brings about the difference 
in the ^veight of contents of the cans of different 
sizes. In the case of canned pork and beans, the 
No. 1 can, cost 1 5 cents, weighs I 1 ounces, while 
the No. 2 can, cost 20 cents, weighs 21 ounces. 
In the latter can, the cost of the additional 1 
ounces is 5 cents. If the housekeeper uses con- 
densed milk in quantity, it is better for her to buy 
the 1 6-ounce can, as the cost per ounce is much 
less than if she purchases the 6-ounce can. Of 
course, it may be better economy for the woman 
to buy the No. 2 can of vegetables, but this is true 
only when the No. 2 can gives her exactly enough 
for one meal for her family. If there is a serving 
left over, it is evidently wiser for her to buy the 
No. 3 can, because then she has enough for two 
meals, and, with different methods of preparation, 
will run no risk of monotony. 

It seems clear, then, that several elements enter 
into the wise buying of food. One who enlists in 
that service ought to have a clear conception of 
the relation of these units of weights, cost and 
measures.

HOME AND CLUB STUDY 
ON FOOD CONSERVATION 

The U. S. Food Administration published, during 1917, a booklet, entitled: 

TEN LESSONS ON FOOD CONSERVATION 
Arranged for School and Club Study 

The booklet is now out of print; but a special edition was run off for 
Libraries, and a copy is on file in every public library, at the present time, available 
for reference use. 

The Food Administration has since published a new booklet (June, 1918), 
entitled : 

NINE LESSONS ON "FOOD IN WAR AND PEACE" 
Arranged for Home Study and for School and Club Use 

This is more applicable to present conditions, as well as more suitable to 
the needs of the individual housewife and the purposes of the small Local Club, 
while it contains much of the more academic matter that appeared in the Ten 
Lessons. 

The Publishers of The Home Keeping Book urge all home-keepers to send 
to the Federal Food Administrators of their Home States (see Names and Ad- 
dresses on page 9 of this Supplement) for copies of the Nine Lessons on Food 
in Wau- and Peace. 

We urge all Local Clubs to secure copies of the Nine Lessons; also to ap- 
point a Committee to go to the nearest local Public Library, read the Ten Lessons 
(out of print as above) and copy such matter as will be of interest to the Club, as 
does not appear covered in a better manner for the Club's use in the Nine Lessons. 

We will give herewith only the Titles of the Nine Lessons, together with 
Miss Tarbell's most excellent Introduction, as the booklet itself is too compre- 
hensive for us to attempt to include it here in full, and too valuable and important 
to be injured by rehashing in excerpt form. Get the book itself, for your own 
use. 

We will give some of the more important paragraphs, and more detail as to 
contents, on the Ten Lessons, which are out of print. 

"FOOD IN WAR AND PEACE" 

This is a comprehensive study of the entire question of food economics, 
planned and arranged for Home Study Clubs, and of almost inestimable value to 
the home-keeper, both in her own home and for use in Home Study Clubs and 
Societies. 

It is a booklet of considerable size, a complete text-book in itself. 

Write to the Federal Food Administrator for your State, and obtain a copy.

"FOOD IN WAR AND PEACE" 

The United States Food Administration, in co-operation with the Depart- 
ment of Agriculture and the Woman's Committee of the Council of National De- 
fense, has issued the above pamphlet containing a series of lessons for the special 
use of clubs and neighborhood groups, showing what the nation is asked to do 
about the food supply, and why. The lessons have been prepared in response to 
many requests for a simple and brief statement of the kind and quantity of food 
needed for health, and of the ways in which changes may safely be made so that 
the requests of the Food Administration for saving, substituting, and using the 
various foods may be intelligently, rather than arbitrarily, obeyed. 

Each lesson has been prepared by a specialist whose authority is unques- 
tioned. U. S. Food Administrator Hoover has explained the present situation in 
his discussion of "Food and the War"; Dr. Graham Lusk, of the Advisory Com- 
mittee on Food UtiHzation of the Food Administration, has told us what food we 
should use in a day, and has explained "calories" and other puzzling terms; Dr. 
Alonzo E. Taylor, who is associated with the Food Administration and with the 
War Trade Board, and who has spent much time abroad since the war began, has 
told us about wheat, why we should save it, and how to use it. Other lessons 
have been written by Dr. C. F. Langworthy and Miss Caroline Hunt of the Office 
of Home Economics, and Dr. Charles J. Brand of the U. S. Office of Markets, De- 
partment of Agriculture; by Dr. E. V. McCoIlum, of Johns Hopkins; Dr. Lafay- 
ette B. Mendel, of Yale ; and Dr. Ruth Wheeler, of the University of Illinois. Miss 
Ida M. Tarbell has written the introduction to the lessons. 

A number of practical suggestions and some recipes have been added by 
the editors to each of these papers, as well as a few^ references, and a list of lantern 
slides. 

The lessons may be obtained in each State from the Federal Food Admin- 
istrator. A limited free edition has been issued. Arrangements may also be 
made with the Illustration Division, U. S. Food Administration, for the use of the 
lantern slides. 

INTRODUCTION 

By IDA M. TARBELL 

Woman's Committee, Council of National Defense 

No finer piece of practical work was ever put up to the American w^oman 
than that assigned her in the National Campaign for Food Control. There are no 
two questions about the necessity for scientific handling of our food supply. All 
that is needed to prove the point is to apply the multiplication table. We must so 
use our food that we keep all of our people abundantly nourished. At the same 
time, we must release for our Allies sufficient quantities of those foods which are 
necessary for their health and which can only be obtained through us. The mul- 
tiplication table shows that it can be done. But to do it means not only resolution 
— it means knowledge. Nothing is more needed at the moment than a clear un- 
derstanding by all women of just how their part in this tremendous task is to be 
carried out. 

It is not easy for the busy woman who is not in direct touch with the 
sources of scientific information on the subject of food to learn just what she ought 
to do and how to do it. She knows that she is not doing her part unless in place 
of those things that she gives up for the sake of our Allies, she provides her fam- 
ily with others which are equally nutritious. But where can she learn how to do 
this? 



SUPPLEMENT— FOOD CONSERVATION S-55 

This set of lessons has been prepared for her. Their intelligent use will 
teach her how to readjust the family meals to meet the national needs. 

The lessons have been planned and edited, at the request of the Woman's 
Committee of the Council of National Defense, by experts from the U. S. Depart- 
ment of Agriculture and from the U. S. Food Administration. A glance at the 
list of names attached to these different lessons will show that the editors have 
been able to rally to their help some of the best known specialists in the country. 
It is only another of the many proofs that w^e are having that there is no talent so 
superior that it does not gladly turn all that it has to the use of the country. 

It is believed that these lessons, with their lists of references and of care- 
fully selected lantern slides, by which they may be illustrated, w^ill be of enormous 
educational value. What is taught here is not only good for war times ; it is equally 
a contribution to peace. To learn to do every common thing in life in the most 
scientific manner is one of our high duties at the present moment, but learning to 
meet our great need now will do much to help us as a nation in the future to do 
these common things in a finer and more comprehending way.

PUBLICATIONS OF VITAL INTEREST 
THE FOOD CONSERVATION PROGRAM 

The education of 1 00,000,000 people in new habits of eating is one of the 
great problems resulting from the war. 

With the shortage of food abroad, with the partial failure of transportation, 
the shortage of labor, and the resulting world conditions, each one of us has a new 
responsibility. We must conserve and protect the food supply now in existence or 
soon to be harvested, so that it will supply the population of this country and of 
our European allies. 

We can do this if we save and if we do not waste. It will require our care- 
ful thought three times a day. Not only must we eat carefully the products of the 
day, but we must store carefully the perishable vegetables and fruits that are 
abundant. 

The home should be the center for the production and storing of canned 
fruits and vegetables, jellies and preserves. It should have its bags and boxes of 
dried fruits, vegetables and cereals. By the use of sugar in preserving fruits and 
fruit juices w^e can save materially on butter. 

We must begin a systematic campaign against gophers, rats, mice, and 
destructive insects, as they take an immediate toll out of our growing crops and 
our stored foods. 

There are a large number of available bulletins on food and its preservation. 
The state schools of Agriculture have, many of them, series of excellent publica-

THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— SUPPLEMENT 



THE CORNELL READING COURSE FOR THE HOME 

This course was instituted so that the problems especially of the farm home 
could be studied in the same scientific way as are those of the farm. The lessons 
are on such household subjects as relate to food, shelter and clothing, and are ac- 
companied by discussion papers. The discussion papers contain questions that 
bring out the point of view^ of the practical housekeeper. As a result there has 
been a large personal correspondence with the women of the State of New York, 
who are at liberty to ask questions at any time relating to their home problems. 

The Reading Course is free to residents of New^ York State. A lesson is 
issued each month.

FUEL ADMINISTRATION 

SUB-SUPPLEMENT 

At the last moment — indeed, while this work is on the press — 
we have been requested to include a few pages on the urgent need 
of our country to SAVE FUEL— and to PROVIDE NOW for the 
COMING WINTER'S NEEDS— for each and aU of us to do our part 
to assist the Fuel Administration in its work — as gravely important 
in many ways a& the saving of food. 

No such fuel shortage as occurred last winter must be permitted 
again — with the tie-up in transportation, the congestion of manufac- 
tures, and the positive human suffering that were endured. It is the 
duty of every man and every woman to do his and her full part to 
prevent ever again even an approach to such conditions. 

It is our pleaisure to add these pages in the form of this SUB- 
SUPPLEMENT for the U. S. FUEL ADMINISTRATION.

EARLY BUYING 

and 

CONSERVATION OF COAL 

UNITED STATES FUEL ADMINISTRATION 
Speakers' Series No. 1 

About 2,000 years ago five foolish young women were barred from a wedding 
because they had neglected to buy any oil for their lamps. There were five others who 
had plenty of oil. They were the early buyers. (Matthew, xxv.) 

The United States Fuel Administration is urging every consumer in the country to 
follow the example of the wise virgins. As a stimulus to cooperation in this matter, the 
price of anthracite coal has been reduced 30c. a ton from April 1 to September 1 . 

There are two powerful reasons for early buying. One is selfish. The other is 
patriotic. , 

You will not only save money by buying early, but you will guard yourself and 
your family from a repetition of the hardships of last winter. 



If you don't want heatless days next winter, 
order your coal now. The Fuel Administration is 
doing its utmost to insure increased production of 
coal. The Director General of Railroads is work- 
ing to increase the transportation facilities of the 
Nation. Their combined efforts, however, may be 
defeated by the recurrence of such weather as 
prevailed last winter. They will certainly be de- 
feated unless a large majority of the domestic con- 
sumers cooperate with them by buying early. 

If you order your coal immediately, you will 
be certain to get your winter supply. If you do 
not buy now, you may not get it, and you cer- 
tainly will not get any sympathy from your ne.gh- 
bors if you shiver. 

Foresight now means anthracite next winter. 

There is something much more important than 
your personal comfort, however, involved in this 
campaign for early buying. 

One hundred million people must be kept warm 
next winter. Hundreds of thousands of factories, 
upon which the United States and the entire civi- 
lized world depend for the successful prosecution 
of the war against Prussian autocracy, must be 
supplied with coal. 

The industrial activity of the Nation has resulted 
in production in excess of our transportation facili- 
ties — in other words, we are manufacturing more 
goods than the railroads can carry. 



There is only one y^ay to meet the situation. 
Less freight is moved during the summer months 
than at any other time. The coal must be moved 
in summer. 

Just because you are warm now don't forget 
you w^ere cold last winter. If you neglect to buy 
your winter supply now, you will put an unnec- 
essary burden on the railroads. 

Don't say to yourself, "It can't possibly make 
any difference if I don't buy now^. Suppose every 
one of the 100,000,000 people of the country took 
that position. What chance do you suppose you 
would have of getting in your winter's coal? What 
right have you to assume others will buy early? 
Are they more provident than you? Are they 
more patriotic? 

You CAN borrow money. You CAN'T borrow 
coal. Do you get it? If money is not as plentiful 
as it might be, do without a few of the summer 
clothes you are planning to buy — cut down your 

summer trip borrow money if necessary do 

something — anything that will enable you to buy 
your coal nov^r. 

There will be an increasing demand for coal 
cars as the season advances. The United States 
has taken over nearly 700,000 tons of Dutch 
shipping. Before the summer is over many ships 
will be launched by the Shipping Board and added 
to the merchant marine of the United States. 



CONSERVATION OF COAL 

Conservation is another name for economy, and economy has been defined face- 
tiously by some one who name is not important as "doing without something you want 
in order to buy something you don't want." That definition, however, does not fit the 
kind of economy you are urged to use in cooperating with the United States Fuel Admin- 
istration. 

You wanted coal last wnter. You will want it just as much next winter. Just 
think how badly you will want it if you haven't got it. 

S-70 



SUPPLEMENT— FUEL ADMINISTRATION 



S-7I 



You have no right to talk about inefficiency in 
others until you have bought your winter's supply 
of coal and thus helped lift the burden from the 
railroads. The United States has entered the war, 
and every factory has increased its demand for 
coal. This year there will be more factories. 
There will be more demand. Every war industry 
will be working at top speed turning out -materials 
for ships and airplanes, and in making munitions 
and supplies of all kinds. 

Two things must be done to avert a greater 
shortage this year than occurred last year. 

More coal must be taken out of the mines, and 
less coal put into household furnaces. 

Increase in production will be difficult under 
any circumstances. It will be impossible unless 
you cooperate by ordering your coal now. This 
is not exaggeration. It is a cold fact. 

In London and Paris they hide in the coal cellars 
from the air raids. You may have to do the same 
thing if you don't (ill your cellar writh coal now. 

Coal cannot be stored at the mines, and when 
there are no orders to be filled the mines close 
down. Your order will help to keep them busy 
during the summer. This is the only way pro- 
duction can be increased. 

That extra shovelful of coal you save will send 
a troopship faster through the danger zone. The 
Fuel Administration cannot regulate the amount 
of coal you shall burn each day. It has regulated, 
however, the amount you will be allowed to buy. 
Your retail dealers know how much you have been 
accustomed to use, or should use, and they have 
■been warned by the Fuel Administration not to 
sell you more than your normal supply. 

If you waste that supply and run short before 
the ■winter is over, it will be your own fault. It 
is up to you to save it in every possible way. 



When you try to borrow coal next winter you'll 
only borrow trouble. Buy yours now while the 
price is reduced. "Over there," when the men go 
into the trenches, each one has the same quan- 
tity of water in his canteen; just enough to last 

him until he gets back — if he does get back to 

camp. He knows exactly how many swallows 
of water there are in that canteen, and that if he 
does not save it he will suffer, because it is a point 
of honor with him not to take water from another's 
canteen, even though suffering the tortures of the 

damned. Will you can you — fail to practice as 

much self-control in the saving of coal as that boy 
does in the saving of water? 

Economical use of your coal, however, is not the 
only way you can help the Fuel Administration 
in its campaign for conservation. 

That campaign will include every possible means 
for saving coal. Many of the methods used will 
cause you annoyance, inconvenience, sacrifice of 
pleasure, perhaps even loss of income. There is 
not one of you who would hesitate to make heroic 
sacrifices. Will you refuse, then, to make those 
small sacrifices without which America cannot 
win this war? Will you jeopardize the lives of 
those boys who are fighting for you by refusing 
to save coal, "when every shovelful you save means 
a shovelful for the factories that are making the 
munitions, the food, and the clothing for them? 

A cold citizen doesn't make a \varm patriot. Go 
to the telephone and order your winter's coal now. 

Does your blood boil when you read and hear of 
Prussian atrocities? Do you see red when you 
read of the air raids on defenseless towns, the 
bombardment of Paris, the murder of women and 
children? Do you want to get into the fight? 

You can fight Germany by heeding the Fuel 
Administration's appeals. 



EARLY PURCHASE OF COAL URGENT 

Dr. Harry A. Garfield, United States Fuel Administrator, made the folio-wing state- 
ment in regard to the importance of buying coal early: 

"Place your orders at once. If domestic consumers have not sufficient storage 
space for the coal they will need, they should enlarge their bins. If public utilities and 
industries engaged upon Government work have not sufficient storage space they should 
at once provide it." 



The householder in Germany can get only one- 
third of the coal he wants. You can get all you 
need if you buy now. "The production of coal in 
this country is fundamentally a transportation 
problem. There are enough coal cars and enough 
locomotives to transport the necessary quantity of 
coal only if every car and every locomotive is 
used to its maximum capacity every day in the 



year. There are enough operatives in the mine 
to get the coal from the ground if those operatives 
can work every day in the year and if the coal 
cars and locomotives are available every day. If 
the coal cars are idle for a week or a month the 
result is a loss of a week's or a month's possible 
coal production. There is no way to make up 
this loss. The country needs the greatest utiliza- 



S-72 



THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— SUPPLEMENT 



tion of the coal-carrying facilities every week and 
every month. It has no surplus cars and no sur- 
plus locomotives to carry more coal in a succeed- 
ing week or in a succeeding month to make up 
for the failure to use the existing cars and loco- 
motives in a preceding month." 

The coal operators cannot store coal when it 
comes from the mine. You can. Make space for 
the coal you will use next w^inter — then fill it. 
**There is plenty of coal in the ground to meet 
every need. This coal can be taken from the 
ground only in consequence of orders placed with 
the operators. If those orders are delayed, the 
coal remains where nature has put it. Coal 
operators have no other storage space for their 
coal. Unless the operators have orders for their 
coal they cannot load the coal cars, nor will the 
coal cars be placed at their mines. Without orders 
for coal the operators cannot ship it, for they can 
give no directions where it should be taken." 

One of the worst forms of slacking is putting off 
doing your duty. Order your supply of coal at once. 
"Inconvenience of paying for coal in the spring 



or summer, when it wU not be needed until 
autumn or winter, should not influence any con- 
sumer to delay placing his order and securing his 
supply. It is far wiser to borrow^ money in the 
spring to pay for one's coal than to wait until 
autumn or winter, when, if the coal has not been 
mined and shipped, money cannot procure it." 

"The Fuel Administration, through the State 
fuel administrators and local committees, is pre- 
pared in every reasonable way to aid public utili- 
ties, essential industries, retail dealers, and domes- 
tic consumers in placing their orders and in secur- 
ing assurance of a sufficient supply of fuel. All 
these Governmental agencies, how^ever, are pow^er- 
less if the consumers themselves fail to act. Again, 
therefore, the Fuel Administration urges every 
consumer to place his orders immediately. This 
should ordinarily be done through the medium of 
supply upon w^hich the consumer has relied in the 
past. If this course is follow^ed, it may be hoped 
that the suffering and loss of the past winter w^il! 
not be repeated. if it is not done, consumers 
will have themselves to blame." 



HOW COAL USERS CAN HELP WIN THE WAR 



If you take care of the shovelful, the coal mines 
will take care of the rest. The following statement 
was made by Dr. Garfield as to the necessity for 
cooperation on the part of consumers, and the 
steps that have been taken by the United States 
Fuel Administration to improve the quality and 
facilitate the distribution of coal: 

"The Fuel Administration must have the support 
and the active cooperation, not only of those w^ho 
are engaged in production and distribution of fuel, 
but of every coal user in the country. Each must 
bear his share of the patriotic sacrifice which must 
be made if the coal supply is to be properly in- 
creased and adequately distributed." 

You can afford to borrow money to lay in your 
supply of anthracite now. The 30 cents a ton 
reduction in price w^ill pay the interest on w^hat 
you borrow. "An adequate coal supply is vital 
to the winning of the war. Without it we cannot 
make munitions or other w^ar supplies or build the 
ships w^hich must carry men and materials to the 
battle front. Without it industries will be stopped, 
labor thrown out of employment, and the homes 
of the people w^ill be cold." 

"By carefully draw^n regulations the Fuel Ad- 
ministration has insured the shipment of 'clean 
coal' from the mines. Coal containing an undue 
amount of foreign matter w^ill be penalized in 
price, and producers w^ho take extraordinary 
measures in the preparation of their coal w^ill be 
recompensed. These measures w^ill keep off the 
railroads and out of the bins of the consumers 



a large amount of unburnable ihaterial w^hich was 
included in last year's coal production." 

There are a hundred w^ays to economize in the 
use of coal. Practice some of them. "The Fuel 
Administration expects the coal consumers, con- 
tinuing their patriotic cooperation w^ith the Gov- 
ernment in all its w^ar measures, to maintain a 
steady and constant demand for coal in order to 
attain this result." 

Uncle Sam can't send supplies to the boys over 
there w^ithout coal. Save some to help your boy 
and your neighbor's boy. "To safeguard the con- 
sumer, the Fuel Administration has prescribed 
regulations to prevent profiteering and to govern 
the distribution of coal by licensed jobbers and by 
retailers. Each domestic consumer w^ill be per- 
mitted to secure a full normal supply of coal, but 
no more." 

"Every ton of coal that is hoarded against 
future needs and is not used during the winter is 
actual w^aste. The labor and transportation used 
to bring the coal to the consumer and the actual 
energy of the coal itself are withheld from doing 
their part toward speedy victory. Consumers 
should secure just a little less coal than they be- 
lieve they need and should make every shovelful 
give its full value in heat and power. Every 
shovelful saved means help for the industries in 
turning out supplies for our troops abroad, help 
for the ships that must bridge the 3,000-mile gap 
between our shores and the battle front, and help 
toward ultimate victory." 



EMERGENCY FUEL FROM THE FARM WOODLAND 

Circular 79, Office of the Secretary 
United States Department of Agriculture 

By A. F. HAWES 

Extension SpecialUt 
Forest Service and States Relations Service 

Because of the heavy demand for coal, both for commercial as well as domestic 
use, and because of the great burden laid upon the Nation's transportation facilities and 
the possible shortage of coal in certain sections of the country, the demand should be re- 
lieved wherever feasible. Farmers frequently are situated so they can profitably supply 
fuel from their woodlands and thus relieve, to a considerable extent, the demand for coal. 



Manufacturers, of course, cannot substitute 
wood for coal; neither can city people, because 
this would result in even greater railroad conges- 
tion. Nor is it likely that in either the South or 
the West the use of wood for fuel can be greatly 
increased. But it ought to be entirely practicable 
in many cases to replace coal with wood for fuel. 
If. by substituting w^ood, one-quarter of the coal 
burned by farmers and one-tenth of the coal 
burned in villages could be saved, the total saving 
would amount to betw^een 65,000 and 70,000 car- 
loads. 

It is where team-hauled wood can be used in 
place of railroad-hauled coal that the change should 
be made. Farmers w^ho own woodlands and 
people in villages who can purchase wood from 
nearby farms are the ones in the best position to 
reduce their consumption of coal. For heating 
many kinds of buildings wood is the more con- 
venient and cheaper fuel. This is particularly 
true in the case of churches, halls, summer cot- 
tages, and other buildings for which heat is re- 
quired only occasionally; but is then wanted in 
large volume at short notice. 

Furnaces are built especially for burning w^ood 
in 3 or 4-foot lengths. Short lengths, of course, 
can readily be burned in an ordinary coal furnace 
or in a box stove, though this is rather w^asteful 
of fuel. Many furnace manufacturers, however, 
make a special w^ood grate for use in their fur- 
naces. One advantage in burning w^ood is that 
on moderately cool days the furnace can be run 
at a lower ebb than when coal is used, consum- 
ing only enough fuel to remove the chill. When 
w^ood is used in a round poJ: furnace, care should 
be taken to have each piece lie flat. 

If a stove grate is too coarse for w^ood, a sheet 
iron cover over a good part of the surface will 
make it suitable, or a few fire bricks can be used. 
Wood grates are sold which are made in two 
pieces and which can be inserted through the fire 
door and placed on top of the regular grate. 



RELATIVE HEATING VALUE OF WOOD 
AND COAL 

In the matter of heating value, one standard 
cord of well-seasoned hickory, oak, beech, birch, 
hard maple, ash, elm, locust, or cherry is approxi- 
mately equal to one ton (2,000 pounds) of an- 
thracite coal. It takes a cord and a half of soft 
maple and two cords of cedar, poplar, or bass- 
wood, however, to give the same amount of heat. 

One cord of mixed w^ood, well seasoned, equals 
in heating value at least one ton (2,000 pounds) 
of average-grade bituminous coal. 

Table 1 shows the price w^hich the consunter 
can afford to pay for a cord of wood as the 
equivalent of anthracite coal at various prices.

If the consumer can buy coal at $8 a ton, it 
would hardly be worth his while to burn first-cIass 
wood at $8 a cord, except in an open fireplace, 
because coal is a more convenient fuel. If, how- 
ever, coal becomes so scarce that it cannot be 
secured in sufficient quantities, the consumer will, 
in some cases, have to burn w^ood at $10 or even 
$ 1 5 a cord.

THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— SUPPLEMENT 



WOOD A PROFITABLE FARM CROP. 

Firewood ought to bring a better profit this year 
than ever before, on account of the higher prices 
which are likely to prevail. Wood is a much less 
perishable crop than many which the farmer raises. 
When properly piled, the better kinds of wood will 
last from two to three years, though it steadily 
deteriorates after the first year. To have the best 
heating value, as well as to reduce the cost of 
hauling, wood should be thoroughly seasoned, 
which means air-drying it, from six to eight months. 
When piled so as to get a good circulation of 
air, however, 50 per cent of the moisture may 
be removed in three months. Wood cut in Octo- 
ber and November, therefore, may be burned the 
latter part of the winter. 

OPPORTUNITY TO IMPROVE THE WOODLAND 

The prices which cordwood will likely bring 
this year offer an opportunity for the farmer to 
improve his woodland. Improving the woodland 
means weeding out the poorer trees. In the past 
this has seldom been practicable, for the inferior 
wood was not marketable. With wood bringing 
only from $4 to $5 a cord, there is very little 
opportunity to secure a profit of even $ I a cord. 
But with the prices indicated for the coming win- 
ter, thinnings become practicable over a wide 
range of country in the vicinity of good markets. 

Some of the things to remember when cutting 
in the woodland are: 

1 . Dead or dying trees should be removed. This 
not only utilizes material which is fairly dry, and 
which would otherwise be wasted, but lessens the 
danger of fire. 



2. Good, sound, straight logs ordinarily should 
not be used for fuel, since they are more valuable 
for lumber. There is a great difference between 
the prices paid for logs of different grades, even 
of the same kind of wood. Branches, crooked and 
decayed logs, trunks broken in felling or otherwise 
defective, should be used for firewood. 

3. Trees likely to be attacked by insects or 
fungi should be removed to safeguard those which 
remain. In eastern New England, for example, the 
gipsy moth is a serious enemy of many woods. 
Several of these are of little value and can well 
be removed, thus reducing the food available for 
the insects. Where the chestnut blight is serious, 
the chestnut should be largely cut. 

4. No portion of the woodland should be cut 
clean unless the owner has carefully considered 
the matter and decided that that particular part 
is best adapted for farm purposes, or that he will 
replant it with forest trees. Old trees, where they 
predominate, should be gradually removed, since 
they are not increasing in value. The next gener 
tion of trees will be largely determined by those 
which are left for seed. The successful woodland 
owner ^vill study the growth and uses of the dif- 
ferent kinds of trees. He will then cut out those 
of little value and slow growth and keep for seed 
purposes those which will product valuable lumber 
in a relatively short time. Table 2 classifies in 
a general way the trees v^rhich should be favored 
and those which should be removed for fuel. In- 
ferior individuals of the better species, e. g., those 
which are diseased or which are likely to be 
blown over, should, of course, be cut.

To secure a second growth of better trees, sev- 
eral things must be borne in mind: (a) Too large 
openings should not be made, because the ground 
vi^ill dry out and weeds, like berry bushes, Vk^ill 
come in and crowd out the young trees. For this 



reason it is often a good plan to leave some of 
the inferior trees for shade. (b) Some trees, like 
the oaks, hickories, and beech, have heavy seeds 
or nuts which cannot be transported any distance 
except by animals or birds, while others, like the 



I 



SUPPLEMENT— FUEL ADMINISTRATION 



S-75 



birch, maple, ash. and basswood, have light seeds 
which are carried long distances by the wind. For 
this reason more frequent seed trees of the nut 
varieties are necessary to get a good stocking of 
young trees. 

5. Woodlands made up of a nearly even-aged 
stand of second growth are more comparable to 
the garden than to the dairy. Here the problem 
is to remove the weeds as a means of getting a 
quicker yield of timber. The small stunted trees 
are the weeds, since they can never make a 
normal growth. The large healthy trees should 
be favored, because they will grow rapidly to 
maturity. They are not to be confused with the 
mature trees in the old woodland, though in gen- 
eral the same species will be favored in both cases. 

OWNER SHOULD SECURE EXPERT ADVICE 

The foregoing suggestions regarding methods 
of cutting should be taken simply as suggestions. 
The woodland owner who wishes to avail himself 
of the opportunity to improve his woodland, which 
the high price of wood makes possible, should 
secure specific information from some reliable 



forester. In States having a State forester, appli- 
cation should be made to him. In others, applica- 
tion should be made to the county agent, the State 
agricultural college, or to the United States Forest 
Service, Washington, D. C. 

COMMUNITY ACTION REGARDING WOOD 
SUPPLY 

Communities which feel they are threatened 
with a serious fuel shortage will do well to take 
measures to stimulate the cutting of wood. Farm- 
ers may hesitate because of the high cost of labor 
to invest money in this way. If, however, a mini- 
mum price sufficient to allow them a fair profit 
could be guaranteed by the consumer, they would 
cut all that was needed for the community. Such 
contracts should be placed as early as possible, so 
that the wood may be properly seasoned. 

Since few farmers get out enough wood to re- 
quire a stovewood mill as part of their equipment, 
it is suggested that a group of farmers operate 
such a mill cooperatively. In many localities, the 
farmers' club would be an admirable organization 
for such an undertaking. 



FIVE WAYS OF SAVING FUEL 

IN HEATING HOUSES 

(From Technical Paper 199, Dept. of Interior) 

By HENRY KREISINGER 
INTRODUCTION 

This country faces a shortage of coal, and it is the patriotic duty of every citizen 
to save coal in heating his home. If everybody "does his bit," a ton of coal at each 
home can be saved easily during the winter. For the entire country, this saving would 
amount to 20,000,000 tons of coal, which is nearly as much as all the coal mined in France 
during the present year. Five ways in which coal can be saved are as follows: 

1. Of the coals available in your market select the one that requires the least 
attention in burning. 

2. Use an economical method of burning your coal. 

3. Keep your house temperature 62 to 65 degrees F., instead of 72 to 75 degrees. 

4. Heat as few rooms as the comfort of your family will permit. 

5. Shorten the heating season as much as possible.

quire 



1. SELECTION OF COALS 

house-heating equipment the fires can be 
very little attention; therefore fuels that re- 
little attention in burning are the most 
economical and give the best satisfaction. In time 
of war less desirable coal may have to be used, in 
order to simplify transportation problems, but the 
fact remains that some coals are more efficient 
than others when the same attention is given the 
fire. Usually the man of the house can attend 
to the furnace early in the morning and again in 
the evening. In some houses the furnace is at- 
tended only when the house becomes either too 
hot or too cold, and thus the fire is allowed to 
run from one extreme to the other, conditions 
which are very unfavorable to saving of fuel. 

In order that a fuel may be burned economically 
in a house-heating furnace, the fuel used should 
be of such kind that the fire requires little atten- 
tion. The following fuels, in the order named, 
are the best fuels for house-heating purposes: 

Anthracite coal in sizes from Yl inch to egg size. 
Gas-retort or metallurgical coke in pieces |/2 
inch to 3 inches across. 

Coal briquets 2 to 3 inches in diameter. 
Screened Pocahontas (semi-bituminous) coal 
over '/i inch and through 3 or 4 inch screen. 

Sized bituminous coal in pieces !/£ to 3 inches 
across. 

If these fuels can be bought, fine sizes or slack 
coal or other fuels requiring frequent attention 
when burning should be left for power plants, 
where the firemen can and should give the fires 
frequent attention. 



2. USE AN ECONOMICAL METHOD OF 
BURNING YOUR COAL 

The conditions under ^vhich house-heating ap- 
paratus is used are difficult to meet. The tem- 
perature of the house is to be kept uniform, with 
the firings far apart and with little attention given 
to the fires. The questions for each household to 
decide are: How much variation in the house 
temperature can be tolerated, and how much atten- 
tion can be given to the furnace. The kind of 
heating apparatus has a great deal to do with the 
uniformity of the house temperature and the 
amount of attention that must be given to the 
fire. Hot-water systems will give much more uni- 
form temperature with less attention to the fires 
than hot-air systems. No one set of rules will 
work satisfactorily in all cases. 

FIRING ANTHRACITE 

When firing anthracite, the best results are ob- 
tained by spreading the coal evenly over the entire 
fuel bed. The fire should not be allowed to be- 
come too low before putting on a fresh firing. A 
fuel bed 5 to 1 inches thick gives good results. 
The fire should be disturbed as little as possible. 

FIRING BRIQUETS 

Briquets, when properly made, are very good 
fuel for house-heating purposes. However, the 
supply is decidedly limited. When burning bri- 
quets the fuel bed should be kept 8 to 1 2 inches 
thick. The fresh charges should be spread evenly 
over the grate area. The fire must not be dis- 
turbed. Poking breaks the briquets and spoils 
the fire. 

FIRING SEMI-BITUMINOUS COALS 

The semi-bituminous coals of the Pocahontas 



SUPPLEMENT— FUEL ADMINISTRATION 



S-77 



type are good fuel for heating a house. They are 
nearly smokeless and make but little soot. For 
regular firing the coal can be spread evenly over 
the entire fuel bed; or, it can be fired like bitu- 
minous coal, the fresh charges being placed alter- 
nately on one side of the grate and part of the 
surface of the fuel bed left uncovered. The al- 
ternate method should be used if the firings are 
heavy. The fire keeps better overnight if the last 
firing is heaped to one side of the grate. Good 
results are obtained with fires 8 to I inches thick. 

FIRING BITUMINOUS COALS 

The bituminous, or soft coals, are smoky and 
cover the flue surfaces with a large amount of 
soot and tar, which reduces the transfer of heat 
and impairs the draft. Bituminous coal should be 
fired by placing the fresh charge on one side of 
the grate only, leaving part of the surface of the 
fuel bed uncovered. The volatile matter rising 
from the freshly fired coal is ignited by the red- 
hot coal of the uncovered part of the fire and a 
large part of it burns. 

If the entire surface of the fuel bed is covered 
with a heavy charge, the volatile matter from the 
fired coal does not ignite for a considerable length 
of time after firing and passes away unburned as 
tarry, greenish-yellow smoke. The furnace and 
the flues become filled with the smoke and when 
the fire finally works its way through the fresh 
layer of coal the smoke and the gases may ignite 
with an explosion violent enough to blow the 
pipes down and fill the house with smoke. These 
explosions are particularly apt to happen if the 
coal contains much slack; therefore, with such 
coal particular care should be taken that part of 
the bright fire remains uncovered. This method 
of firing reduces the amount of soot deposited in 
the flues, so that less frequent cleaning is neces- 
sary; it also reduces the heat losses from incom- 
plete combustion, thus directly effecting a saving 
of coal. 

DRAFT REGULATION 

Draft regulation is perhaps the most important 
factor in burning coal efficiently in house-heating 
furnaces. The draft is regulated mainly with three 
dampers; one of these is on the ash-pit doors, 
one on the firing door, and one in the pipe con- 
necting the furnace with the chimney. For many 
furnaces the damper in the flue pipe is an opening 
covered with a hinged lid A, in Fig. 1 . When this 
lid is closed the full chimney draft is effective 
in the furnace. When the lid is lifted, the chim- 
ney draws air from the cellar instead of drawing 
the gases out of the furnace, and the draft in the 
furnace is reduced almost to nothing. Between 
the two extremes any draft can be obtained by 
proper adjustment of the lid. 

The damper B on the ash-pit door regulates the 
flow of air through the fire, and the amount of 



air flowing through the fire determines the rate 
of combustion, or the amount of coal that the 
furnace can burn in an hour. Therefore, to con- 
trol the rate of combustion and thereby regulate 
the amount of heat the furnace delivers to the 
house, the furnace attendant adjusts the damper 
in the ash-pit door and the damper to the chimney.

Fig. 1. — Position of dampers in a house-heating 
furnace. Damper A regulates the draft in 
the furnace and should be used with Dampers 
B and C. Damper B regulates the supply of 
air through the grate and the rate at which 
the coal burns. Damper C regulates the 
supply of air over the fire and the complete- 
ness of combustion. Damper D controls the 
draft and should be used with Damper A. 
The Damper C in the firing door supplies air 
over fire needed to burn the gases rising from 
the fuel bed; therefore, its regulation controls the 
completeness of combustion of these gases. When 
soft coal is burned, a large volume of combustible 
gases rises from the fuel bed immediately after 
the firing; therefore, the damper in the lire door 
must be opened enough to allow the air necessary 
for burning the gases to enter the furnace. After 
the smoky gases cease to rise from the freshly 
fired coal, the quantity of air supplied over the 
fuel bed can be reduced by partly closing the 
damper in the firing door. There should be a 
damper, D, in thp smoke pipe; this damper can 
be used in addition to Damper A to control the 
draft. 

No rule can be given for the exact adjustment 
of the dampers. The proper adjustment must be 
ascertained by trial; with a little care and some 
patience the proper adjustment of the dampers 
of any furnace can be determined. In general, to 
make the fire burn faster, close the lid A (Fig. I) 
in the pipe leading to the chimney and open the 



S-78 



THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— SUPPLEMENT 



Damper B (Fig. 1) in the ash-pit door. To make 
the fire burn slower, raise somewhat the lid in the 
check draft A and partly close the Damper B in 
the ash-pit door. The Damper C in the firing door 
is more difficult to adjust because there is no 
way to determine the completeness of combustion. 
In burning soft coal, this damper should be 
slightly open all the time. In burning hard coal 
or coke enough air for complete combustion may 
enter the furnace through various leaks, even when 
the damper is completely closed. 

3. KEEPING THE HOUSE TEMPERATURE 
LOWER 

In heating houses considerable fuel can be saved 
by keeping the temperature in the house 5° to 
10° F. low^er than is customary; instead of the 
temperature being between 70° and 74'-' F., it 
can be kept between 62° and 68° F. without any 
discomfort or any danger to health. In fact, some 
medical authorities ascribe the "colds" common 
in w^inter to living in too w^arm houses. Thus 
Dr. William Brady' writes: 

"Air need never be heated above 65 ° F. for 
comfort. Anything above that point represents 
w^aste and extravagance. It simply runs up a big 
coal bill and opens various doors to the coming 
of the doctor. The onset of cough in winter is 
almost a sure sign of such extravagance." 

Those interested in saving the country's fuel and 
lowering their own coal bills will be glad to know 
that keeping the house at 65° instead of 72° F., 
means a saving of 15 to 20 per cent of their 
fuel. It may also mean a saving on the doctor's 
bill. 

4. HEATING FEWER ROOMS 

Another easy saving of fuel can be effected by 



heating fewer rooms in the house. In many 
houses the family can get along comfortably by 
keeping warm three or four rooms instead of 
heating six or seven rooms. And this can be done 
without any real hardship on the family. Really, 
only the three rooms in which the family lives need 
be heated at all. If consumptives can get well 
by sleeping outdoors, why could not well people 
keep well by sleeping in unheated bedrooms w^ith 
the w^indows wide open? 

5. SHORTENING THE HEATING SEASON 

In some homes the furnace is started too early 
in the fall and is run too late in the spring. The 
chimneys of these homes are belching smoke and 
spreading soot over their neighborhood, while the 
neighbors keep windows and doors open to the 
outside air and even sit on the front porches. 
These faint-hearted people, in their fear of catch- 
ing cold, heat their houses unnecessarily; thus they 
waste the country's coal, increase their coal bills, 
invite sickness into their homes, and make life 
unpleasant to their neighbors. When mornings 
and evenings are chilly, a grate fire for a short 
time in one or two rooms will make the house 
comfortable. 

CONCLUSION 

Every householder, by endeavoring to save coal 
in the ways suggested, can render his country 
valuable service, and he will not be doing his full 
duty toward his country unless he renders such 
service as he can. In addition, he should remem- 
ber that besides helping his country he will help 
to shorten the misery and the horror of the great 
w^ar.

To the "Home-Keeper": 

This book is arranged so that it is of equal value to the "beginner at home- 
making" and the well advised home-keeper of long experience. 

Patterns and instructions to serve as guide and mentor to the beginner 
•will be found provided in terms and arrangement of the easiest simplicity. Sci- 
entific studies v^^hich can be mastered only by those of long practice and much 
experience are provided for the latter. Outlines for independent study are pre- 
sented for both, as well as suggestions for class and club wrork, and lists of ref- 
erence books and pamphlets for home economic education to almost any degree. 

But in the main the book is intended for an everyday practical reference- 
work for the average home-keeper in the average home; it is simple in its terms; 
its guideposts, for finding one's w^ay about, are clear, concise, and planned for the 
quick finding of what is wanted at the time when it is wanted. 

The woman w^ho has managed a household for some years will have, in 
a miscellaneous collection of magazines, recipe books and clippings, the most of 
the matter contained herein, and because of her familiarity with the assortment 
may be able to find, occasionally, what she wants at the time wanted. 

The book claims usefulness mainly in the fact that its contents are collected 
into the covers of one binding, arranged, classified, indexed, forming a convenient, 
compact, attractive and interesting reference work in all departments of "home- 
keeping." The matter itself is distinctly not original — it is time-tried and tested, 
the last word of the best and most experienced practical authorities in each case. 

— The Publishers. 



To Those to Whom These Presents Shall Come — 

Greeting: 

The Publishers will deeply appreciate it if you will send us, frequently, 
special scraps or memoranda of your own — in as great abundance as you may be 
willing to write them out for us. 

When you have something tried and proven, which you do not find in- 
cluded in this Book, or which improves on what is herein published, either in effi- 
cacy, convenience or economy, we will most sincerely w^elcome its receipt in every 
instance. This most especially applies to the various sections other than Cookery 
and Kitchen Recipes. In helping us in this manner you are helping other "home- 
keepers" — future owners of future editions of the Book, and present owners who 
receive the Supplement Service. 

There is no such other work published as The Home-Keeping Book, pro- 
curable either in the general book market or otherwise. Commend it to your 
friends. 

The Home-Keeping Book is in every way, in fact as well as in spirit, in- 
tended and published with our sincere wish and aspiration to all "home-keepers" of 

"A Long, a Happy and a 
Prosperous Home-Keeping."

"CONSERVATION" DOES NOT MEAN "PRICES" 

It is difficult for the most of us to appreciate the meaning of the term 
"conservation." To us all, at first thought, the entire program seems futile if it 
does not effect, and effect at once a "reduced cost of living" in our own homes. 
"What does it all amount to," we ask, "if meat and grocery bills continue higher 
week by week?" 

Conservation cannot be expressed only in dollars and cents. The saving of 
money is not necessarily synonymous with economy. 

If there were exactly ten barrels of wheat flour in the world, and twenty 
people each wanted a barrel, they might bid up the price until the ten least able to 
pay the advancing bids retired from the competition and the flour went to those 
who were left. Some of the successful ten, however, might have decided to use 
less than a barrel ; some of the others would thus have had a chance. But irrespec- 
tive of how the prices went, the same ten barrels would be booked for consump- 
tion. Although individuals had effected a certain "economy" in this case in not 
bidding — waiting instead for relinquishment of a part of the stock at a lower price 
— there has been no conservation in the total stock. The action may have been 
commendable, in resulting in forcing prices lower, especially provided those who 
sold the flour had been cornering or controlling the market by holding up the total 
stock, or otherwise were undeserving of the prices they were obtaining. But that 
is not conservation. 

If people pay high prices it means merely that some are distributing to 
others a surplus of money which they possess, or feel that they possess. It changes 
the total supply neither of money nor of merchandise; it tends only to equalize or 
scatter the supply. 

If, however, someone notices that there are only ten barrels of flour in the 
world, that there are two million bushels of corn, that much of this corn is going to 
waste because the farmers cannot get it to market, learns that this corn meal can 
be mixed with wheat flour to make as palatable and wholesome bread as wheat 
flour alone — and proceeds to buy corn meal to use along with the flour — that is 
conservation. Such person has "saved" or "conserved" some actual food stuff; 
the total food stuff of the nations is increased by the amount of corn meal which 
one certain family has consumed — corn otherwise wasted has gone into the human 
stomach for sustenance. If one million families have multiplied this act into one 
million acts, the total food stores of the world have been pronouncedly increased. 

The proportionate increase is in the single act — though less apparent. The 
individual may or may not save money in the process, but that in no way affects the 
conservation that is involved. 

One may, with intelligence, effect the personal economy and the conserva- 
tion together. He does this if the corn is cheaper than the flour as well as being a 
product that is rotting in the bins. If one eats fruit from his own orchard or veget- 
ables from his own garden under conditions where he would otherwise have to see 
them wasted or ship them to a market where some of them will rot, if he buys them 
from his neighbor who cannot ship them to advantage, or if he preserves, dries or 
cans them for winter use, he is conserving and at the same time saving his own 



THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— INTRODUCTORY 



pocketbook. All perishable goods consumed near point of production tend to con- 
servation, for of such goods shipped to market a certain portion will eventually 
spoil and never be consumed at any price. 

If one changes from flour to potatoes, granting that no potatoes are rotting 
in the market but merely that they are cheaper at the time than the flour, he is 
saving money for himself but he is not conserving ; he is adding nothing to the total 
stock unless some of the potato stock of that season's crop is going to waste. In 
this particular instance, however, at this particular time, he is conserving for the 
benefit of the war conditions of the Allies — for the Allies can use and must have 
flour, and w^e cannot send them potatoes. 

When one eats fish in place of meat he conserves food. Cattle, sheep and 
hogs represent a limited and reducing supply; besides, corn or other grain stuflFs 
have to be fed to stock to produce stock. But millions of fish infest the waters of 
the sea; they die; alive or dead other fish consume them. Many varieties live 
off of sea vegetation. None of them are fed on what would else be human food. 
The cost of fish represents no cost of production, no diminuation in total food but 
in each case a one hundred per cent, increase. The cost is strictly the labor of tak- 
ing them and marketing them. The eating of fish represents a net gain and is con- 
servation in its w^idest sense. 

Conservation of food means making less food accomplish the same susten- 
ance, or the same food more sustenance, using waste foods in the stead of foods 
of which little or none is wasted, providing food by tilling soil, by seining the sea, 
or otherwise making food where food did not exist before. 

Bear these principles in mind and follow them and you are "doing your bit" 
in the food conservation program which must help keep the world alive during 
this period of shortage of food which must continue and must become yet more 
and more pronounced inevitably until this war for the world's democracy and 
liberty is won. 



A WORD FROM PRESIDENT WILSON 



This is the Time for America to Correct 
Her Unpardonable Fault of Wastefulness 
and Extravagance. 



In no direction can they (the women of America) so greatly 
assist as by enlisting in the service of the Food Administration and 
cheerfully accepting its direction and advice. By so doing they will 
increase the surplus of food available for our own army and for ex- 
port to the Allies. To provide adequate supplies for the coming year 
is of absolutely vital importance to the conduct of the w^ar, and with- 
out a very conscientious elimination of waste and very strict economy 
in our food consumption we cannot hope to fulfill this primary duty.

THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK 

and 
COLLEGE AND GOVERNMENT BULLETINS 

Practically all of the States issue bulletins of great value to the student of 
Home and Food Economics. We cannot incorporate in this work even an approx- 
imation to the wealth of this material. It is not the intention of The "Home- 
Keeping" Book to cover the exhaustive scientific studies which the States, and the 
Government, with their hundreds of trained experts, cover far more thoroughly — 
nor to merely "copy" or "repeat" from their bulletins. 

This w^ork is intended as a concise reference book, not a full scientific treat- 
ise. We try to gather together under headings the more important recommenda- 
tions and conclusions reached by experts, so that a woman in her home may get 
the information she w^ants, quickly, when she wants it, rather than be compelled to 
look through many bulletins, or to study those bulletins until she know^s much of 
them by heart. 

We commend mastery. We urge all women to by all means send for Govern- 
ment and State bulletins, study them, master as many of them as possible, and 
know her subjects thoroughly. 

But even after this is done she will find constant use for The Home-Keep- 
ing Book for quick reference purposes, for refreshing the memory on details, for 
exact recipes and on subjects she has not seen fit, because not frequently needed, 
to burden her mind w^ith mastering. 

The State Colleges, as a rule, furnish free to residents of their own States, 
the bulletins they publish. To non-residents they usually charge a few cents to 
cover cost. The Government bulletins are mostly free to all; on some there is a 
small charge. 

We are heavily indebted to Government bulletins, and to those of our 
own State (New York) for much information, and for matter copied bodily in this 
book. We have drawn heavily, also, on the bulletins of the low^a State College, 
wrhich publishes certain bulletin work in a form peculiarly adaptable to our use as 
well as peculiarly good. We have used to a less degree bulletin matter from a 
number of the other States. We have draw^n strongly on the better class of maga- 
zines and the best of a large number of books published on the various subjects 
embraced in this w^ork. 

These magazines and special book publications are of great value to the 
home-keeper, and she should by no means overlook the Government and State bul- 
letins, but should accumulate a good reference library of such publications. 

This is particularly true at this moment, when it is the absolute duty of 
every woman to "help win the war" by studying particularly the bulletins of the 
U. S. Food Administration and the U. S. Department of Agriculture, and generally 
all publications that will instruct and aid her in practical home conservation and 
economics. 

—THE PUBLISHERS. 



WE MAKE NO GUARANTEES 

This book is a compilation. The matter contained in its pages 
has been secured, in all items, from the best sources. The most re- 
liable authorities have been consulted. We are indebted to many 
U. S. Government Bulletins and State and College Bulletins, as well 
as to numerous women's periodicals and reliable books published 
touching on the subjects treated. We have used no matter for which 
it was not stated in connection with the promulgation through the 
above sources that the suggestions or the recipes involved had been 
thoroughly and reliably tried and tested. 

At the same time, errors and mistakes are possible on matter 
even from the best authorities. If such are found, we can only indulge 
the request that our attention be called to the same in order that w^e 
may make corrections for the benefit of others in the future, as they 
in turn become owners of copies of future editions of The Home- 
Keeping Book.

A Little Sharp Talk to the Woman 

Straight from the Shoulder 

About the Way a Woman Buys 

You go into a grocery store and buy a can of coffee. You see it displayed 
there — or perhaps the grocer mentions it — and you have heard of it before, and so, 
unless you came after some other brand you had been using and liked, you buy it. 

If you don't like it, you don't buy it next time. You try something else you 
have heard of. 

If you do like it, however, and think it good value, you ask for it next time. 
And you keep on asking for it, time after time. Why do you do this? 

Because you like it — and the price suits you. And you learn that each time 
it is the same coffee, and tastes the same and makes the same number of cups at the 
same strength, and — well, you simply feel that you know and sort of value it like an 
old friend. 

If the grocer asks you to try something else, you ask, "Why?" You say, 
"1 like this and don't want to change." If he urges you, you think he is doing so 
(and he probably is) because he makes more profit on the other. And that isn't to 
your interest. 

It's perfectly true that he may have something of as good value, that he can 
sell you at less price, but you have never heard of it before — anyhow you like what 
you have and don't care to change. 

He might have it in a bin — ^bulk goods — or he might label it his "A- 1 Grade." 
And you might try it once and Hke it — but somehow imagine it seemed to taste 
different the next time. 

Whereupon you would think that perhaps he had changed the mixture in 
that bin, a little bit — the price of one of his blends might have gone up on him — or 
he might have been unable to get exactly what he wanted and had to change. But 
as it was still his "A-1 Grade" he didn't change the label. 

And so you continue to buy package goods — the ones that "make good" 
with you the "first time" — because you find that a given brand sold you back of a 
given label will be always the same as before all the way through. 

But here's something you didn't know: 

It cost the manufacturer of that coffee several times the entire price of that 
first can you bought to get you to buy it. 

He had been spending advertising money for months, or perhaps years, get- 
ting the name of that brand so frequently before you in various w^ays, that when you 
saw it at your grocer's at a time when you were thinking of changing — when some 
other coffee had disappointed you — you promptly recognized that brand as "widely 
advertised" — and decided to try it. 



4 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— A LITTLE SHARP TALK 

The total amount he spends for advertising divided by the number of new- 
sales made to nev^ customers, would leave the manufacturer several times the price 
"in the hole" — ^if those customers didn't come back time after time. And that's why 
you find this coffee always the same. 

The manufacturer couldn't begin to afford to vary it by the flavor of one 
berry. You might stop "coming back" — as you did with some other man's when 
you first tried this one's. And when it costs him the price of three or four cans 
to "get you started" he can't afford that. 

That's the reason why you can dq)end on advertised goods. That's why you 
get the "package goods habit." Because it pays everybody concerned, including 
most essentially you, on whose satisfaction the whole structure depends. 

The Oft-Propounded Query, "Who Pays for the Advertising?" 

Advertising is part of selling cost. It is strictly a proportionate charge. If 
it costs thirty dollars to sell ten sew^ing machines, the cost on each is three dollars; 
but if it costs fifteen thousand dollars to sell ten thousand machines the cost is one 
dollar and a half on each. If the advertising is successful it sells such a large num- 
ber at once that it not only reduces the selling cost but the manufacturing cost, all 
through the purchase of material, the making and every other factor. 

The query is often heard, regarding some widely advertised goods, and espe- 
cially if they are successfully advertised goods, "Who pays for the advertising?" 

The question is foolish. You pay for it, if you buy the goods, but — you pay 
less for the goods than if they were not advertised. 

If a taxicab charges forty cents a mile for one passenger, or three dollars 
for three passengers for a five-mile trip, do you ask, "Who pays the three dollars?" 
The three passengers chip in, glad to save a dollar apiece. 

That is what happens in successful advertising. You can rest assured that if 
a manufacturer advertises continuously on a large scale it is successful, or he couldn't 
keep it up, and the goods do give the purchaser good value or the advertising would 
not be successful and would not be continued. 

Successful advertising enables a manufacturer to offer better goods at re- 
duced cost of production and reduced cost of selling, and prosper on a small profit. 
It enables you to know what you are getting and that you secure good value and 
uniform quality for your money. 

This is the magic of it and your reason for buying advertised goods. 



ON FURNITURE AND DECORATION 

To the Home-Maker: 

Permit us to say here, briefly, that you should if possible start your "home- 
making," by all means, with a comfortably furnished place. This is investment, 
not expense. Insofar as your purse permits fix your quarters up. Make no hesita- 
tion to patronize, if need be, the "installment house" of reliability. It is easier to pay 
a small sum, weekly or monthly, on goods bought and in use, rendering your life 
more comfortable and economical, than to try to "board" and at the same time set 
aside those same funds into a sum with which to "set up later." 

Strain a point and attain this if you can. It saves money, nerves, health in 
the end, and yields comfort and content at once. 



Importance of Studying Household Questions 

(From Selection of Household Equipment, Year Book of Department of Agriculture) 

A generation ago such a subject might have been thought beneath the dignity 
of scientific investigation, but the last few years have seen a great change in this 
respect. The way in which our homes are run, or, in more technical terms, the 
science of home economics, is now in much the position that scientific agriculture 
was in twenty or thirty years ago. The leaders had then shown that science can 
improve crops, and some of the more progressive farmers were giving the new ideas 
a practical test, but many of the rank and file were still doubtful whether it was 
worth while. Few^ farmers of today, however, would care to go back to the days 
before experiment stations and fertilizer control. The fact that the problem of mak- 
ing the home as efficient as possible includes so many different kinds of questions 
will make necessary a great deal of study along many different lines, just as agricul- 
ture has included problems as different as those of insect pests and cheese-making. 
In solving these, every intelligent farmer, who has studied them on his own farm, has 
done his part as well as the special investigators in the laboratories. In the same way 
every intelligent housekeeper who studies the household problems of cooking, clean- 
ing and furnishing and tries to solve them with the help of both practical experience 
and scientific information hastens the day when household management can be as 
accurately planned as that of the factory and the farm. 

Planning and equipping a home in an accurate and systematic way does not 
mean that it should not have any individuality. On the contrary, while the prin- 
ciples which govern a wide choice of furnishings are the same for all kinds and con- 
ditions of houses and families, the articles actually chosen in accordance with these 
principles would vary just as much as the house and the families for which they are 
intended. Whether one's house is large or small, things should be chosen to fit act- 
ual needs, and to fill them in the way most economical of money, labor and materi- 
als, and as far as possible, to give pleasure as well. If the house or the family is 
large, different things will seem necessary, convenient, economical and suitable, 
from those which would answ^er the requirements if there were less space or fewer 
persons to be provided for. The size of the income also influences choice, but the 
fact that one cannot pay high prices does not mean that one must always put up 
with inconvenient and unattractive things. A table of easy-working height prob- 

5 



6 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— FURNITURE AND DECORATION 

ably costs no more than one too high or too low, nor would making wooden blocks 
to set under the legs of a low one be an impossible expense; yet a difference of a 
few inches may mean the difference between working easily and getting tired every 
day. Increasing the convenience of working by such simple means as moving a 
table or stove or rearranging the kitchen cupboards or kitchen cabinet may make a 
noticeable difference in the number of movements necessary for the daily work, and 
this saving of energy not only lessens the labor but also prevents the irritation which 
an intelligent person naturally feels at wasting effort. 

As far as the element of pleasure or beauty is concerned it is the necessary 
things rather than special ornaments which make the greatest difference in the 
attractiveness of the home. Comfortable furniture of good, plain design and har- 
monious colors on the w^alls and floors are more necessary to make a home restful 
and pleasant than many pictures and much bric-a-brac. Fortunately it need not cost 
any more to get these necessary things in satisfactory forms than in poor ones, 
though it may mean choosing more slowly and carefully. 

If the best equipped house is the one in which all its features and furnish- 
ings are most completely suited to the needs of the occupants, the standard for every 
family must be adapted to such individual peculiarities as the location of the house, 
the amount of the family income, the size of the family, and their different occupa- 
tions and interests. Judged by this standard, a w^oman vv^ho with limited means has 
made a convenient, comfortable and attractive home out of an unpromising, incon- 
venient farmhouse has shown greater ability than one who with the help of an 
expensive decorator has obtained a good effect in a house equipped with all mod- 
ern improvements. 

Modem Housekeeping Appliances and Labor Savers. 

Indulge as liberally as you can in practical modern devices. Strain several 
points to include these in your equipment. They are doubly "investment." We 
cannot urge you too strongly to go in at once for many of the modern electric, 
gas (or oil) devices, vacuum or other cleaners — good ones — fireless and other spe- 
cial cookers and cooking utensils and kitchen and laundry and bath articles of merit. 

They save labor and time — which means that they add to your (or your 
employe's) actual money value — and to your ow^n nerve and health value as a wife 
and companion, or mother. 



SELECTION OF HOUSEHOLD EQUIPMENT 

(Extracts from Bulletin of above title from 
Year Book of Department of Agriculture for 1914) 

In equipping her home, the housekeeper should be guided by the same prin- 
ciples that would be followed in the selection of equipment for any other workshop, 
and should choose furnishings and tools which will make it possible for her to carry 
on her various household tasks with the least w^aste of time, work and materials. 
A house should be equipped for efficiency in housework just as carefully as a mod- 
ern shoe factory is equipped for making shoes. In such a factory lighting, heating, 
ventilation, sanitation, etc., are as carefully considered as the machinery, and these 
matters of hygiene are even more important in the home, which is not merely a 
workshop but also a place in which to rest and recuperate. Since a home is even 
more than that, and serves also as the material setting for the life of the family, 
other points must be considered vs^hich have little or nothing to do w^ith efficiency 
in a factory. It is certainly as important in a home to provide for comfort and 
wholesome enjoyment as for cooking and cleaning, eating and sleeping. 

Planning before Buying. 

Haphazard buying is always extravagant and nowhere more so than in con- 
nection with house furnishings. There is such a bewildering variety of things to be 
used in a house that, unless the housekeeper keeps a clear idea of what she w^ishes 
most and plans her buying carefully, she will find herself getting things which, 
though useful, are not the most useful, or are not the best adapted to her particular 
needs. 

In order to buy in accordance with a definite plan she must often steel her- 
self against the allurements of bargain counters or of beguiling salesmen, not be- 
cause the wares they offer are not intrinsically good or cheap, but because they may 
not be what she really needs most. In choosing labor-saving devices it is a good 
rule to give the preference to those v^hich save heavy work and w^hich lighten tasks 
most frequently performed. A machine for washing clothes saves more bodily 
energy than a patent roasting pan, and a meat chopper is used more often than a 
device for stoning cherries. 

But if a family really wishes its home to be something more than a place to 
eat and sleep in, it ought to plan as deliberately for increasing the production of 
comfortable and profitable leisure, pleasant social intercourse and an intelligent 
interest in things outside of its material needs as for mere food, clothing and shelter. 
Since we must have dishes to eat from, we might as w^ell have them in attractive 
shapes and patterns and color, especially as good-looking ones do not necessarily 
cost more than others. The more any article that is used in the home includes all 
three elements of necessity, convenience and beauty, the more efficiently will it 
serve its purpose. 




Hou5el7ofi3|i>Scbec)ule 



Have a weekly program. Systematize your time, follow the system, and 
get more done in less time, and have your leisure together instead of in snatches. 
Lay out an outline for the week — to suit your own needs and conditions — write it 
down. Lay out each day, so far as you can, in the same manner as the week. Do 
it mentally, if not on paper — but you follow it better if on paper. Adopt system. 



HOUSEHOLD ACCOUNTS 

Every housekeeper should "keep books." There is no better aid to thrift 
and economy than an absolute knowledge of what money goes for. It enables one 
to readjust, from month to month, cutting down on the less needful to supply the 
more essential without discomfort or real deprivation. Here is a simple and effect- 
ive household accounting system, with a page to illustrate it. 

Get a loose-leaf journal, or what is known as a "trial balance" book (six or 
more columns for figures), or use any blank book, ruling the columns yourself. 
Write in the headings for the departments for the expenses of which you want to 
keep separate account, and make your entries daily in the "cash" columns. Once 
a week carry out the totals, or the separate items of the amounts, into the distribu- 
tion columns, that is, the department columns to which they belong. Once a month 
close the account and carry down your totals. You can see at a glance the cost of 
each housekeeping department. This enables you to compare the totals from month 
to month and the more intelligently rearrange your expenditures.

GENERAL HOUSEHOLD— HOME MANAGEMENT

HOME MANAGEMENT 

(From Bulletin under the above title issued by Iowa State College of Agriculture) 



DIVISION OF INCOME 

A. It has been estimated that from one-fourth to 
one-third of the income may be saved by 
scientific management. Bullock has estimated 
that at least one-iifth of money spent for food 
is actually ^vasted. 

1. By buying needlessly expensive materials. 

2. By careless storing of goods. 

3. By failure to select according to season. 

4. By waste. 

5. By poor preparation of food. 

6. By badly constructed ovens. 

B. If the home maker would conduct her business 
along the lines suggested, by careful study of 
good business principles, she would probably 
find that she was running her home in a better 
way at less cost. 

C. Suggestions for division of income. 

1. Knowledge of Amount of Income. 

a. Salary. 

b. Average income when not salary. 

2. Use of Budget. 

"A budget is a detailed plan of anticipated in- 
come and expenditures for some definite future 
period of time, as a week, month or year; it is 
intended to control expenditures during that pe- 
riod." 

"A budget is a finacial plan for the future." 

3. Factors which will influence budget. 

a. Size of income. 

b. Size of family. 

c. Locality of home. 

4. Suggested Division (for average income) 

a. Food (25%). 

b. Clothing (20%). 

c. Rent or taxes and repairs (15%). 

d. Operating expenses (15%) 

Renewal of equipment 

Emergencies 

Help 

e. Higher Life (15%) 

Education 

Religion 

Recreation 

f. Saving (10%) 

Money in Bank 
Investments 
Life Insurance 



The division just suggested will be fairly satis- 
factory for the family having an income of from 
$1,000 to $1,200 a year. As the income increases 
or decreases, the proportions spent in these various 
ways will be changed. 

5. Success in Division of Income Depends 
upon: 

a. Knowledge of textiles. 

b. Ability to make and repair gar- 

ments. 

c. Good taste concerning color, design 

and material for dress and home 
decoration. 

d. Knowledge of laundry work. 

e. Knowledge of food values. 

f. Knowledge of food preparation. 

g. Ability to plan meals. 

h. A thorough knowledge of personal 
hygiene. 

i. Understanding of symptoms of dis- 
ease and knowledge of home 
nursing. 

j. Knowledge of disinfectants and 
cleansers. 

( I ) In care of sick. 

(2) In disease. 

(3) In care of bathroom fix- 

tures. 

(4) In care of vaults and earth 

closets. 

(5) In care of closets. 

(6) In care of cellar. 

(7) In care of refrigerator. 

(8) In care of food materials. 

k. Knowledge of wood finish and care 
of equipment. 

I. Good taste concerning pictures. 

m. Good taste and good judgment con- 
cerning furniture. 

n. Good judgment concerning choice 
of books and magazines. 

A study of these fourteen elements of success in- 
dicates that the home-maker who hopes to make a 
genuine success of her business must have a thor- 
ough working knowledge of: 



Food 

Personal Hygiene 

Care of Children 

Home Nursing 

Textiles 



Home Decoration 
Home Art 
Good Pictures 
Good Literature 
Good Music 



Laundry Work

THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Section I.— GENERAL HOUSEHOLD 



The quality of the home depends not so much 
upon the amount of money spent as upon the good 
taste and good judgment that prompt the spending. 

D. Law3 of Expenditure Ernst Engel. 

**l. The louver the income, the larger the pro- 
portion claimed by sustenance. 

"2. Lodging, heating and lighting absorb an in- 
variable proportion, whatever the income. 

"3. Clothing claims a constant proportion. 

"4. The larger the income, the greater the pro- 
portion allotted to well-being."

CARE OF FURNITURE 



To Polish Furniture (Cornell Reading Course) 

— Apparatus: a bottle of furniture polish, a small 
handful of cotton waste, and one or two flannel- 
ette dusters or old soft cloths. 

Take a piece of the cotton waste or an old soft 
cloth, put some polish on it and rub it on the wood. 
Use as little polish as possible, but rub hard to re- 
move dirt and scratches. Rub with the grain of 
the wood. 

Take the rest of ".he cotton waste and rub as 
much of the polish as possible off the piece of 
furniture. 

Polish finally with the flannelette, rubbing briskly 
but lightly until the surface is bright and there is 
no appearance of oiliness. Be especially careful to 
rub out corners. 

Burn all the cotton waste. Be careful about this 
because oily cotton has often caused a fire through 
its spontaneous combustion. 

Put away the polish bottle, wiping the outside 
carefully. Wash the dusters and hang them up to 
dry. 

Recipe for Furniture Polish — (Cornell Reading 
Course) — Take 8 02. linseed oil, |/2 pint vinegar, 
Yl oz. alcohol, Yi oz. butter of antimony, Yl °^- 
muriatic acid. Mix the ingredients thoroughly, 
and Keep in a closely corked bottle. This polisn 
should not be used on pianos. 

Other Simple Ways to Polish Furniture — Home- 
made polishes may be made to work wonders, even 
when the ^vood has been without attention for a 
long time. 

Only the thinnest kind of polishes should be 
used on highly varnished surfaces; the object is 
only to clean, without injuring, what is almost an 
enamel. 

There are times when soap and water should be 
used, but before these are put on, polish or its oils 
should be rubbed in so the water will not dull the 
surface; otherwise washing may permanently dam- 
age the surface. 

Olive oil is less likely to be sticky, hence, should 
waxing prove too difficult, it may be substituted. 

An excellent furniture polish is made of equal 
parts of boiled linseed oil, vinegar and methylated 
spirits. 



A combination of beer and beeswax is recom- 
mended by an English authority, who says that first 
the wood must be washed and dried, then there 
should be ready a quart of beer in which has been 
boiled long enough to blend a piece of beeswax the 
size of a pigeon's egg and tablespoonful of sugar, 
this mixture being allowed to cook but not to get 
cold before being put on with a soft furniture 
brush. The liquid dries on and is then polished off 
with a soft cloth. 

It is useless to merely polish over dirt or grease; 
when these are present use soap and water. 

There is no simpler way of treating varnished 
mahogany, oak or walnut, than with vinegar and 
oil, the vinegar being the cleanser. The ingredi- 
ents may be used in one of two ways: by mixing 
the two in the proportion of one-third vinegar and 
two-thirds olive oil or linseed oil, shaking vigor- 
ously and rubbing on with a soft cloth, afterwards 
polishing with a dry rag; or by using the vinegar 
first and later the oil clear, applying each with a 
different cloth. 

Waxing — Mahogany or old walnut has a "soft" 
or wax finish and should always be kept in a state 
of luster. For a smooth surface, such as a table 
top, white wax is best, but it takes time and muscle 
to put on. The top should be made quite clean and 
then shaved wax rubbed in with the palm of the 
hand until all has disappeared and the top has an 
even and high finish. This is the most difficult of 
all polishing that can be done at home, but pays in 
the end, for the surface keeps better, requires scrub- 
bing less often and always looks bright. Every few 
days, after being wiped over with a soft cloth, it 
should be rubbed again with the hand to polish. 
Wax need not be put on oftener than once in three 
weeks after the luster has been attained. At first 
once a week will not be too often. 

To use oil as a polish for a dining table is a mis- 
take, for no matter how carefully the unguent is 
rubbed in some will remain on the surface, and this 
will eventually stain the linen. 

Scratches on Varnished Furniture — Remove from 
varnished surfaces by going over carefully with a 
camel's hair brush that has been dipped in shellac 
varnish until they disappear. Nothing should touch 
the places until they are quite dry.

THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Section I.— GENERAL HOUSEHOLD 



Bruises on Furniture — Soak a large piece of 
brown paper in cold water for a few seconds; have 
ready some very hot irons. Place the folded paper 
over the bruised place in the wood and then iron 
over it. Repeat this process until the wood is 
swollen. Let the wood dry for an hour or so and 
then polish in the usual manner. 

To Clean a Piano Case — (Cornell Reading 
Course) — Apparatus: a bottle of olive oil, some 
new or perfectly clean canton flannel, a perfectly 
clean chamois leather and a basin of water. 

Wet a small piece of the flannel and drop on it 
a few drops of oil. 

Rub, with the wet flannel, a small section of the 
case at a time, and immediately rub it thoroughly 
with a dry piece of the flannel before proceeding 
to a fresh section. 

Polish finally with the chamois or a fresh piece 
of the flannel. Rub with the grain of the wood and 
breathe on it occasionally to help remove the oili- 
ness, if any may remain. A very little flour rubbed 
with the grain of the wood will also help to remove 
oiliness, but its use should not be necessary. 

Wash the piano keys with a corner of the flannel 
wet with alcohol. Be careful, however, to avoid 
touching the wood with the alcohol, as it will ruin 
the varnish. 

Piano Keys — When yellow, clean piano keys, as 
well as all ivory articles, with alcohol, rubbed on 
with muslin. If very yellow, use flannel moistened 
with cologne water. 

To Mend Leaking Vase — Melt some parafHne and 
run it over the defective portion or side. As hot 
water, which would melt the parafiine, is not used 
in a vase for flowers, this remedy is perfectly satis- 
factory. 

Gilt Frames — Wipe the frames gently with a piece 
of sponge dampened 'with spirits of wine or oil of 
turpentine, and allow them to dry of themselves. 
If white of egg is applied with a small camel's hair 
brush to fly specks on gilt frames, then rubbing 
gently with a soft cloth, the specks vfill disappear. 

Marble — ^To clean marble, take two parts com- 
mon soda, one part pumice stone, and one part 
finely powdered salt. Sift the mixture through a fine 
sieve and mix it with water, then rub it well over 
the marble and stains will be removed. Rub then 
with salt and water. Wash off and wipe dry. 

To polish black marble rub over with olive oil 
and finish with a clean chamois leather. 

Or: Clean Marble with slices of lemon dipped 
in salt; leave for an hour, then wash off with soft 
cloth and tepid water. 

Sagged Cane Chairs — Cane seated chairs that 
have sagged can be tightened in the following 
manner. Wash them in hot water and soap and 
rinse in clear water. Dry in the open air. 

Leather Furniture — Chairs and couches uphols- 
tered in leather will last much longer if the follow- 



ing mixture is applied once a month: One part 
good vinegar, two parts boiled linseed oil. Shake 
thoroughly together. Apply a little on a soft rag 
and polish with a silk duster or piece of chamois. 
This cleanses and softens the leather; it is also a 
good polish for the wood if applied thereto as well. 
Another good method: Wet the leather first with 
a little hot milk. Then after melting some bees- 
wax in hot water add to it enough turpentine to 
give it the consistency of a thin cream. Put this 
mixture on the leather covers and then polish them 
with a soft cloth. Sometimes milk alone is suffi- 
cient. Dust the leather thoroughly, first. 

Brass Polish — ^This is quite easy to make at home. 
Put I ounce soft soap, I ounce ammonia, 1 ounce 
rottenstone, in a jug. Pour on one pint boiling 
water and mix thoroughly. Some prefer the juice 
of a lemon instead of ammonia. Bottle when cold 
and keep tightly corked. 

A brilliant polish may be given to door fixtures, 
ornaments, etc., by washing them in alum and lye. 
Make a solution by boiling an ounce of alum in a 
pint of lye and wash the article in it. Sweet oil and 
powdered rottenstone vigorously applied with a 
piece of soft flannel will clean brass ornamented 
pieces. 

To Clean Nickel — (Cornell Reading Course) — 
Apparatus: a bottle of ammonia, a tablespoonful 
of whiting in a small bowl, a small woolen cloth, 
and a larger woolen cloth or flannelette duster. 

Stir enough household ammonia into the whiting 
to make a thin paste, as thick as milk. Rub the 
paste over the nickel, rubbing it well into crevices. 
When dry, rub the whiting off and polish with the 
dry woolen cloth. If stains still remain, it will be 
necessary to scour them off with sapolio or some- 
thing similar. 

Note: — When nickel on a stove has been neg- 
lected and is very dirty, it is often easier to clean 
the pieces after they have been unscrewed and 
taken off; but it is necessary to look after all the 
bolts and screws carefully and see that all are put 
back in their proper places. 

Nickel Polish — Equal parts ammonia and whit- 
ing make an excellent mixture for cleaning nickel 
furniture and ornaments. It should be applied to 
the nickel with a cloth and will produce a good 
luster. 

Cleaning Copper — Mix half a cup of flour, half 
a cup of vinegar and two tablespoons salt. It is a 
little harmful to the hands, but you can avoid dip- 
ping your fingers into it by using a big sponge, 
dipping only a corner of the sponge, leaving the 
rest dry, or by using a rag in the same manner. 
Rub lightly if you would have the best results. Be 
sure to dip the article into cold water quickly and 
dry thoroughly, otherwise it will become green. 



GENERAL HOUSEHOLD— HOUSEHOLD HELPS

Cleaning; Gold — Gold and gilt articles may be 
effectively cleaned by washing them in ordinary 
soap and water, and while wet transferring them to 
a bag containing some clean, fresh bran or sawdust, 
shaking well for a few minutes. 

To Fasten Loose Chair Rung — Split the end of 
the rung slightly and insert the end of a small 
wooden wedge, then press the rung tightly in place. 
The harder you press the more the wedge spreads 
the end of the rung until it becomes impossible to 
remove it. 

Piano* Catch Cold — exactly as we do. They get 
hoarse or have a cough or stiff note or some other 
similar complaint which cannot be cured by home 
remedies but require tedious and expensive doctor- 
ing. In order to prevent these avoidable ailments 



a piano should be kept in a moderately warm room 
where the temperature is even — say, sixty or sev- 
enty degrees, the year round, not cold one day and 
hot the next The instrument should not, however, 
be too near the source of heat. It should be kept 
closed and covered with a felt cloth when not in use 
for some time, particularly in frosty weather. Al- 
ways place the piano close to but not against an 
inside wall. 

A Little Duster — It is difficult to keep wicker fur- 
niture and certain other furniture properly dusted. 
Buy a five-cent dish-washing mop, saturate it with 
crude oil or cedar oil and allow it to dry. The 
result is a dustless duster that gets into every 
crevice, is useful for many kinds of dusting and 
does not soil the hands.

FLOORS AND FLOOR COVERINGS 



To Dust Hardwood Floors (Cornell Reading 

Course) Apparatus: a string mop. A dustless 

mop may be used. 

Dampen the string mop if the floor is not a 
waxed one. It may be sprinkled as clothes are for 
ironing, or may be held in the steam of a tea kettle, 
but it must not be damp enough to show wet on the 
floor. 

Co over the floor assigned, being careful that 
every board is rubbed. It is probably better to rub 
along the boards than across them. 

Take especial care to go under tables, desks and 
like furniture, moving them when necessary. 

Wash out the mop with soap and water when 
necessary. Rinse thoroughly, wring dry, and shake 
out well to make it as fluffy as possible. Hang to 
dry in the fresh air, or in a warm place, with the 
head up. 

To Mop a Floor (Cornell Reading Course) 

Apparatus: mopping pail, mop, mop wringer, 
soap solution and hot water. 

Fill the pail three-quarters full of hot water, add 
one-half cup of soap solution, and carry it to the 
room assigned. 

Clear the floor of the room as far as possible. 

Dip the mop in the pail, drain without wringing, 
wet one section of the floor, and rub it clean. Rinse 
the mop in the pail, wring it tightly, and dry the 
wet section thoroughly before proceeding to wet 
another. It may be necessary to rinse the mop 
several times. 

Begin at one corner of the room and work to- 
ward the door. Change the water when necessary. 

Wash and rinse the mop, wring it tightly, and 
hang it head up to dry in the fresh air if possible. 

Empty the pail, rinse pail and wringer before 
putting them away, and leave the tub clean. 

To Wax a Floor — (Cornell Reading Course) — 
Apparatus: the can of floor wax, a waxing flannel, 
a half yard of heavy flannel or a piece of old 
brussels carpet, and a weighted brush. 

The floor must be clean and free from dust. 

If necessary, stand the wax dish or can in a dish 
of hot water in order to soften the wax. 

Rub the waxing flannel on the wax and put on 
a very thin, even layer of wax to the floor. Start 
at the corner farthest from the door and do not 
step on the waxed part. 

Put away the wax and flannel, and keep off the 
floor for at least three hours. The polishing can 
be done after standing an hour, but is more work. 

Fold the piece of heavy flannel twice, making 
four layers, put it down on the floor, put the 
weighted brush on it, and rub each board, with the 
grain, until it shines. The piece of carpet makes 
an excellent substitute for the flannel. The polish- 



ing can be done on the hands and knees without a 
weighted brush, but is much harder work. 

To Keep Carpets Bright Sweep occasionally 

with a broom dipped in water to which a little tur- 
pentine has been added. Carpets will stay bright 
and moths will not infest them. 

To Clean a Carpet — Mix together in a bottle 
equal quantity of turpentine and amntonia. Put 
two tablespoonfuls of this into a quart of water, 
and with this sponge the carpet, after carefully 
brushing it. Only wash a small piece of the carpet 
at a time; do not wet it too much; rub it dry 
with a cloth. 

To Avoid Moths If powdered borax is put 

around the edge of a carpet it will keep away 
moths. 

To Prevent Carpet Bugs — Fill a sewing machine 
oil can or bulb spray with turpentine. Scatter the 
turpentine freely by means of this in the closets, the 
corners and places where these pests are likely to 
be found. 

To Mend Rugs — To patch a hole in a rug, lay 
a piece of woolen under it as a patch, and with a 
large embroidery needle darn cotton in harmoniz- 
ing colors over the v^oolen. It is often possible 
thus to cover a large hole so it will not showr. 
Threads drawn from an old brussels carpet can be 
used for mending a woolen rug. 

When Rugs Slip — Sew a strip of rubber on the 
underside at each end to grip the polished floor. 

Rug Beater — A discarded tennis racquet may be 
put to use, being light and strong and so con- 
structed that it does not destroy the goods. Re- 
move all the cords, keeping only the frame. 

To Sweep Matting — Sprinkle the matting with 
Indian meal and then sweep it thoroughly, sweep- 
ing out the meal and the dirt with it. 

To Clean Matting — The matting should be beat- 
en to remove all dust. Take it out of doors and 
scrub it well with bran water, or with water to 
which a small quantity of salt has been added. 
Soap has a tendency to turn matting yellowr, so 
should not be used. Rinse with cold water, rub dry 
as possible with a clean cloth, and hang on a line 
to complete drying. 

Linoleum ^The following polish gives a good 

gloss without making linoleum the least bit slip- 
pery: One gill methylated spirit, one pound shellac; 
mix together, and when the shellac is thoroughly 
dissolved apply to linoleum with a soft flannel and 
the gloss will remain even after the linoleum is 
washed. When linoleum begins to show wear. 



GENERAL HOUSEHOLD— FLOOR AND FLOOR COVERINGS

paint the surface with good quality floor varnish 
and allow it a longer time to dry than would be 
necessary for a wood floor. 

Inexpensive Floor Polish — Take one sperm can- 
dle and melt, remove from stove and add one pint 
coal oil. Use with a flannel rag. This makes a 
good floor polish and answers the same purpose as 
many bought polishes. Equal parts of coal oil 
(kerosene) and linseed oil warmed and used to 
rub on hardwood floors will make them look like 
new. 

A Cheap Floor Stain — Dissolve two ounces of 
permanganate of potash in two quarts boiling 
water; if too dark add more water until desired 
shade is obtained. Apply with a flat brush; let dry 
over night and rub with boiled linseed oil or 
varnish. 

Grease Spots on Floors — Do not put hot water 
on new grease spots on floors; the water makes 
the grease "set in." Use cold water and soap or 
soap-powder. 

To Polish Floors and Woodwork with Kerosene 

— (Cornell Reading Course) — Apparatus: The 
kerosene can, the kerosene plate, a kerosene mitt, 
a handful cotton waste or an old soft cloth, and a 
soft woolen or flannelette cloth. 

Put a very thin layer of kerosene in the plate and 
dip the mitt into it. 

Rub a portion of the wood hard with the tnitt, 
being careful to clean out the corners thoroughly. 
Immediately rub as much kerosene off the section 
as possible with the cotton waste or old cloth. Then 
proceed to clean the next section. 

When all the wood has been cleaned and the 
first section has stood for an hour, polish it finally 
with the woolen cloth. It will be all the better to 
stand three or four hours before the polishing. 

Put away the kerosene, mitt, plate and can, and 
burn the waste. 

Wash the polishing cloth in strong soapsuds, 
rinse carefully, and hang it to dry. 



Note — In all wood polishing, rub with the grain 
of the -wood. 

To Clean Woodwork — (Cornell Reading Course) 
— Apparatus: A fiber tub, two flannelette dusters, 
borax, and warm water. 

Put a level teaspoonful of borax into the tub and 
fill the tub ^vith warm water. The water should be 
comfortably warm. 

Wash a section of the woodwork with one dus- 
ter, and immediately rub dry -with the other dus- 
ter before proceeding to the next section. 

When two do this work together, better pro- 
gress is made when one washes and the other dries 
the wood. A step-ladder is necessary for high 
woodwork. 

When all the wood is cleaned, wash out the 
dusters carefully and hang them up to dry. 

Note A steel wire brush, such as is used by 

painters, will expedite the cleaning out of corners 
and angles when the woodwork has been badly 
neglected. 

To Dust Woodwork (Cornell Reading Course) 

— Apparatus: One or more damp flannelette dust- 
ers. 

Begin at one corner of the room and dust the 
baseboard of wainscoting. Do the doors and 
windows as they come. 

Use the dusters to wipe up the dust and do no 
shake them about. When one duster become 
dusty enough to be dirty, take another. Go ove 
every board of the woodwork, and be careful no 
to slur over the corners but to take all the dust out 
of them. 

When dusting stairways it may be necessary to 
use a long-handled cornice brush in order to reach 
all parts. 

Woodwork with many panels is easily dusted 
with a woolly stove-mitt, which is kept for the pur- 
pose. 

Wash out the dusters with soap and water and 
hang them up to dry.

WALLS AND WALL-PAPER 



Cleaning WalU — (Cornell Reading Course) — 
Apparatus: A cornice brush. 

Close all the doors of the room, and cover pic- 
tures and other articles. 

If the room has a cornice, brush the dust out 
carefully. 

Brush first the ceiling, then the walls. Brush 
gently so as to gather the dust on the brush rather 
than to scatter it. 

Shake the brush well, and then put it away. 

Remove the covers from the pictures and the 
other articles gently, carry the covers outside to 
shake, and fold them before putting away. 

Enameled Walls — Wring out a soft flannel in 
tepid water to which has been added a little kero- 
sene. Wipe the enameled surface with this quickly, 
exchanging the cloth for a clean one often. Do 
not scrub; wipe lightly. You will be amazed at 
the quantity of dirt that will come off on the flan- 
nel. Do not smear the wood. Work one direc- 
tion all the time, changing water as it gets dirty. 

Soda for Cleaning Walls — Use two pails tepid 
water. Wet a cloth and sprinkle a little baking 
soda on it, wash a space that can be easily reached. 
Rinse with clear water and wipe dry. Use the soda 
sparingly. 

Smoked Wall — Co over wall first with lime 
water before putting on a coat of paint. One coat 
will be sufficient with this treatment: five cents of 
lime dissolved in a pail of water and put on quickly 
with a whitewash brush. 

Putty — When using putty for filling in very wide 
cracks, the inexperienced person finds it very diffi- 
cult to spread it evenly. To prevent it from crum- 
bling, dip the knife in coal oil. 

To Drive a Nail in Plaster — Put the nail in very 
hot water until it is thoroughly heated. Leave it 
wet, and you can drive it in clean without breaking 
or chipping the plaster. 

Holes in WalU — Holes in walls can be stopped 
with plaster of paris, but mix this with vinegar in- 
stead of water, or it will harden so quickly it will 
be difficult to manipulate. 



To Tighten Picture Nails — Saturate a bit of wad- 
ding with a thick glue, wrap as much as possible 
around the nail, and reinsert the latter in the hole, 
pressing it home as strongly as possible. The nail 
will be held firmly in its place. 

Scratches on Wall-Paper — If wall-paper is 
scratched or rubbed, moisten a scrap of the paper 
that is saved, carefully scrape off the coloring mat- 
ter with thin knife-blade; apply this to spot. When 
dry the spot will be hid. You could never match 
up other coloring matter so well. 

To Mend Crack in Wall-Paper — Tear out by 
hand a piece of paper like that on the wall, a little 
larger than the hole or crack, and starch well. Use 
a caster to roll the edges. Be sure to tear out patch 
by hand; with knife or scissors the patch will show, 
but put on in this way the patch cannot be de- 
tected. 

Varnished Wall-Paper — Varnished wall-paper 
may be wiped with a mixture of paraffin and warm 
water. Half-pint paraffin to a bucket of water. 
Use a soft flannel cloth, wrung fairly dry, and pol- 
ish with a piece of cheesecloth. 

Grease Stains on Wall-Paper — ^To remove, mix 
pipe-clay with water to the consistency of cream, 
spread over the marks, allow to remain for two 
days, then remove with a stiff brush and the stains 
will have disappeared. 

Ordinarily wall-papers may be cleaned with 
dough, or rubbed with a dry cloth only. 

To Remove Wall-Paper from Walls — Use a white- 
wash brush and a pail of warm water and get a 
paper scraper, which can be purchased at five-and- 
ten-cent stores. Dip tip of brush in water and go 
over wall quickly so as to keep water as much as 
possible from running to floor. Get over the entire 
side of wall with wet brush, let paper stand a few 
minutes, then go over it again and scrape with 
scraper. Sometimes after paper is thoroughly 
soaked you can take hold and strip the most of it 
off. If papers are pulpy you have to scrape them 
all off. When one side is partly off wet another, 
keeping it well soaked ahead of you.

GENERAL HOUSEHOLD— CURTAINS, SHADES, CUSHIONS 



21 



CURTAINS, SHADES, CUSHIONS 



Window Curtains — It is never a mistake to 
select neat lawn, scrim, net, muslin or linen for 
window curtains. They should come to the sill 
and may be any length hanging from the top, from 
the middle sash, a quarter from the top, anywhere 
deemed best. 

If the casing is very narrow, the rod on which 
they are hung should be placed below the brackets 
for the shades, so that the shades can be pulled 
over the curtains to the room side. The curtains 
can be shirred on a rod with or without a ruffle 
above. 

They may hang straight, as at casements always, 
or they may be held in place at the bottom by a 
similar rod, as on French windows. 

A Short-Cut in Curtains — So many housekeepers 
use dotted Swiss for sash curtains that this plan 
for saving some yards of Swiss will be welcomed: 

The average window requires two yards of Swiss 
one yard wide. One and a half yards used with 
selvage top and bottom instead of at the sides saves 
half a yard on each window. Besides this, not only 
is the money saved but time is saved in making. 

Turn a hem at the top that is just large enough 
to cover the rod and make as large a hem at the 
bottom as the window will allow; the curtains, also, 
always hang straight. 

To Keep Curtains Clean — In bedrooms where the 
curtains hang straight from the poles and where 
the windows are open at night, sew a brass ring on 
the side of each curtain and put a screw eye up 
high enough on the side of the casing so by loop- 
ing up the curtains they are kept cleaner and are 
less mussed, also let in more air. Take off the 
rings when the curtains are washed. 

To Clean Tapestry Curtains — Take the curtains 
down, brush them well and then rub all spots and 
soiled parts with magnesia. Hang these out on a 
line on a fine, windy day; finally shake them. 

Cleaning Window Shades — -After the summer 
light-colored window shades are usually soiled and 



often fly-specked. Remove the latter by rubbing 
lightly with the very finest sandpaper. Then clean 
by rubbing very gently with a soft cloth wrung out 
of a mixture of one pint hot water and three table- 
spoonfuls of benzine (keeping the benzine away 
from the fire). Dry by wiping with a clean, soft 
cloth. 

To Dust Window Shades — (Cornell Reading 
Course) — Apparatus: A step-ladder and a flannel- 
ette duster. 

Place the ladder firmly so that it is easy to reach 
the spring end of the roller. 

Roll the shade up as far as possible and take it 
down from the window. If it will not roll all the 
way up before you take it down, roll it up before 
coming down from the ladder; otherwise the shade 
is likely to -wrinkle and be damaged. 

Unroll carefully over a table or out on the floor. 
Great care must be taken to prevent the shade from 
wrinkling. 

Roll up slowly, dusting each side as it is rolled. 

Replace the shade on the window, and test to see 
whether it rolls up and down properly. If it does 
not roll quickly to the middle of the window, take 
it off again and roll it up before replacing. If it 
will not pull down to the bottom, pull it down as far 
as possible, take it off again, and unroll it to the 
length of the window before replacing. 

Dust the middle ledge of the window before tak- 
ing away the step-ladder. 

To Renew Window Shades — Old window shades 
may be painted and will look like new. Lay them 
on the floor on newspaper and paint one side. 
When dry, paint the other. They may be painted 
v^hite on the outside and green on the inside. The 
paint covers all cracks and worn places. 

Sofa Cushions Cut a roll of cotton in small 

squares and heat in a pan in the oven, leaving it 
there for half an hour. Do not let the cotton 
scorch. Every square will swell to twice its size and 
will be light and fluffy for filling for cushions.

Simple Terms In Electricity 

Electrical terms have puzzled many housekeepers since the use of the cur- 
rent has become common for cooking as well as cleaning and lighting. 

Electric current is like a stream of water. The size of the steam may vary 
as do water pipes, and the word used to designate the size of an electric stream is 
ampere. Thus, an electric iron requires a large stream, five amperes; a vacuum 
cleaner a smaller stream, one ampere ; while a large range with all the switches on 
will require a still larger stream and may take from fifteen to twenty amperes. 
Thus, only the devices requiring five amperes and under are safe to use on the 
lighting circuit, which carries only that comparatively small-sized stream. 

Another common term is the volt. This means the pressure of the stream 
of electricity. With the w^ater supply we speak of the pressure at the faucets as 
thirty pounds or sixty pounds, etc. With electricity w^e speak of the pressure as 
1 I volts or 1 20 volts, etc. Thus the voltage or pressure is determined by your 
local electric company, while the manufacturer decides the size of the stream or 
amperage required for his device. 

The volt is the actual amount of electricity used. It is measured by gallons 
or cubic feet in the case of water. Thus we would say that the faucet runs fifty 
gallons an hour, while w^ith electricity we would say the iron consumes five hun- 
dred watts an hour. Because the watt is so small a quantity, all electric lighting 
companies use one thousand watts or the kilowatt as their basis of measurement, 
and the cost of electricity is therefore so many cents for a kilowatt used one hour. 

Once these terms are understood it will be a simple matter for any housekeeper to 
determine the exact cost of using any one of her electrical appliances. This method is cor- 
rect for the less common direct current (D.C.) and approximately correct for the oftener 
used alternating current (A.C.). Multiply the pressure or voltage, by the size of the stream, 
or the amperage, and you have the amount of electricity used, or the watts. Thus an iron 
stating on the name-plate "110 volts, 5 amperes," uses 550 watts and costs at a ten cents 
a kilowatt-hour rate just five and one-half cents an hour to run it. At a five cent rate it costs 

23

THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Section II.— GENERAL UTILITY 



approximately three cents for the same service. On all electric appliances you will find the 
volts and amperes plainly stated. 

Most household users of electricity have an unreasoning fear of "blown fuse" when 
really they should consider the fuse in an electrical system like the safety valve in the steam 
boiler. If anything goes wrong the fuse "blows" automatically turning off the current. This 
is accomplished by means of a small wire within the fuse which melts with some slight noise 
which is called "blowing." When you have blown a fuse, do not be frightened, for the 
safety-valve has worked and no harm has been done. Notify the company and a new fuse 
will be put in. Find out the cause of the trouble. Remember that a fuse must be large 
enough to carry the largest stream of electricity that you expect to use at one time, and state 
very clearly to the repair man sent to you all the electric devices you were using at the 
time the fuse blew. Thus, if the toaster and percolator, each consuming five amperes, to- 
gether with the dining-room lights, were all in operation and the chafing-dish consuming 
another five amperes was then started, a blown fuse would immediately result provided the 
fuse was a fifteen ampere one, because the stream of electricity would be too large and the 
safety-valve would "blow," while if the fuse had been a twenty-five ampere one, there 
would have been no necessity for the safety-valve to operate. Be very sure, however, that 
the fuse is not larger than the stream of electricity the wiring can carry safely. 



THE CARE OF LINENS 

It pays to have more bed linen than just enough 
for a change. Your linens will stay in good con- 
dition longer and you will enjoy the pleasure of 
using well-aired, sweet sheets and pillow cases 
from your linen closet, instead of having to put 
on your bed those just returned from the laundry 
with more or less of a laundry odor. 

There must be extra linens, too, for guests or 
sickness; but without order in the closet there will 
be little satisfaction in the good supply. To pre- 
vent the wear and tear being too great on certain 
pieces, use the pieces from the top of the piles, 
slipping those just returned from the laundry to 
the bottom of the piles. 

To keep tab on your laundry supply tack up in 
your closet a list of what you have and what you 
send out each week. The articles being arranged 
in neat piles can be counted almost at a glance 
when the laundry is returned. In a large estab- 
lishment the supply for each room or floor must be 
kept on separate shelves or in separate closets. 

Scent for Linens. — English lavender is the only 
proper scent for bed linens, as it is soothing to the 
sleeper as ^vell as sweet smelling and delicious to 
the nostrils. It is not appropriate for any than bed 
linens, however. 

THE DAILY DUSTING 
(Cornell Reading Course) 

Apparatus: a cheesecloth duster, a slightly damp 
flannelette duster, a string mop, and (if the room 
has a rug or carpet) the carpet sweeper. 

Air the room, if necessary. 

Sweep the rug or carpet with the sweeper. 

Dust any bare floor with the string mop. 



Dust the window glass, vtrindow ledges, and all 
outstanding of wainscoting, cupboards, and the 
like, with the flannelette duster, and the chairs, 
tables and smaller articles with the finer one. 

Use the dusters to wipe up the dust, and do not 
shake them about. When one duster becomes 
dirty, take another. 

Wipe finger marks from electric-light button 
plates. 

When dusting stairways it may be necessary to 
use the long-handled cornice brush. 

Avoid letting soiled dusters rest on beds, up- 
holstered furniture, or on brass or metal parts, and 
like places. 

Be careful to replace desk papers exactly as they 
were found. 

Arrange the window shades before leaving the 
room. 

Empty dust, and put away the carpet sweeper. 
Put away the string mop, washing it if necessary. 
Wash the dusters and hang them up to dry. 

Dustless dusters and mops may be used insteadj 
of dampened ones. 



THE CUPBOARD OR CLOSET 

Cleaning (Cornell Reading Course). — Appa- 
ratus; a dishpan, a scrub cloth, a clean duster and 
a dry sink towel. 

Fill the pan half full of soapy water, comfortably 
v^arm. 

Clean the top shelf. Dust each article and place 
on a lower shelf or other convenient place. Wash , 
the shelf and wipe dry with the sink towel. Re 
place each article belonging to the shelf. 

Clean the remaining shelves, cleaning the bot-i 
torn one last.

Closet Hanging Space. — A small closet will hold 
twice as much clothing without crushing if a small 
pole is fastened from end to end and a few inches 
below shelf, along which you may slip a number 
of hangers upon which suits and dresses may be 
neatly hung. Many more hangers may be sus- 
pended from the pole than could be crowded on 
hooks; besides you still have the hook space at 
back and ends if the closet is not too close; the 
clothing on the hangers does not get so crushed. 

BED AND BEDROOM SUGGESTIONS 

Dresser Drawers that stick need paraffin or soap 
on the sliding parts. Paraffin will rub off less; it 
works into the wood and keeps it smooth. 

Never Sun Feather Beds or Pillows. Air them 
thoroughly on a windy day in a cool place. Sun 
draws the oil and gives feathers a rancid odor. 

All Mattresses, used either by children or 
adults, should be well brushed once a fortnight. 
Put in the sun by open windows when possible. 
In this way the white dust which comes from the 
body is disposed of and mattress disinfected. 

Or, better still, make a covering as you would 
for a pillow case out of heavy unbleached sheeting, 
to fit mattress; close the end by sewing buttons and 
buttonholes. This covering can be removed from 
time to time and laundered; it should be starched 
stiff to prevent dust from sifting through. It will 
keep the mattress nice and new. Mattresses, at 
that, should be brushed and aired when the cover 
is removed. 

Cleaning Brass Beds — Wring out a bit of flannel 
almost dry in sewing machine oil and go over the 
bedstead daintly. It will not dull the lustre, and it 
will remove flyspecks. 

Never touch the brass without having a cloth 
between your hands and the polished brass; the 
perspiration of the hand will tarnish it and form 
verdigris. 

Never hang clothing you have taken from your 
body across the brass rails. Dust all parts of the 
bedstead once or twice a week at least. 

To renovate a shabby brass bedstead, or one of 
iron and brass, wash it %vith soap and water, and 
when it is quite dry, clean the brass parts with metal 
polish, polishing them well with a soft velvet dus- 
ter. Now varnish all over, both iron and brass, 
vrith a transparent varnish. 

Such a varnish may be made as follows: Put six 
ounces bleached shellac and one pint methylated 
spirit in a bottle, and stand it to one side for a day 
or two until it is dissolved, shaking it occasionally. 
Cork tightly. Keep away from fire. Apply with a 
soft brush. 

CLEANING THE BATHROOM 

Cleaning Bathroom (Cornell Reading Course) 

— Apparatus: Closet brush, scrub cloth, dry flan- 
nelette duster and string mop. 



Clean the bathtub. Let in a little very hot water, 
rub soap on the scrub brush, and wash all scum 
deposits from the tub. Rinse out the tub and wash 
the taps. See that the outside is clean, and wipe 
everything dry with the duster. 

Clean the closet. Raise the cover and the wooden 
seat. Wash the bowl thoroughly with the closet 
brush. If necessary scrub above the v^ater line 
vtrith soap, and see that the outside is clean. Flush 
the bowl. Wash the seat inside and out, also the 
inside of the cover. If necessary, wash the floor- 
slab. Wipe e\'erything dry \vith the duster. 

Dust the floor with the string mop. Take pains 
to get the dust out of the corners and from under 
the tub. Dust the chair and the woodwork. 

Wash the closet brush with soap in the wash- 
basin, rinse, shake thoroughly and hang up (this 
brush is usually kept in an inconspicuous corner of 
the bathroom). 

Wash and ^vipe the basin taps. Wipe off all pipes 
below the basin with the duster. If necessary, 
scrub the basin. 

Wash and rinse the scrub cloth and the duster 
in the basin and wring as dry as possible. Rinse 
out the basin and wipe with the duster. Hang up 
the cloths to dry. If tubs and other appliances 
have been neglected and are very dirty, it may be 
necessary to scrub them with kerosene. 

CLEANING THE FIRE-PLACE 

Cleaning Fire-PIace (Cornell Reading Course) 

Apparatus: a stove apron, newspaper, dustpan, 

whisk, the blackleading implements and a duster. 

Spread the newspaper to protect the hearth. 

Brush the ashes from the fire basket or andirons, 
and move the basket or irons out on the news- 
paper. 

Brush the ashes down the ash-hole; or take 
them out, if no ash-hole. 

Blacken the fire basket or andirons, and replace 
them. 

Lay a fresh lire ready to light, using the news- 
paper from the hearth. 

Brush up the hearth, dust the mantel and fire- 
irons. 

Put away the blackleading implements, dustpan 
and other apparatus, and get a basin of warm 
wrater, a small scrub brush and some soap. 

Wash the hearthstone, and if necessary the fire- 
irons. 

A fireplace with red bricks may have the bricks 
reddened with the following reddening mixture: 

I oz. common glue, I tablesp. alum, Yl lb- 
Venetian red, I lb. Spanish brown, I gallon water. 

Dissolve the glue in the water over the fire. 
While hot, add the alum. Add the Venetian red 
and Spanish brown. If too light, add more red 
and brown; if too dark, add water, a little at a 
time, until right. Mix well. Keep in a closely 
corked bottle. Apply with a paint brush.

HOUSEHOLD MISCELLANY 



HOME-MADE CEDAR CHEST 

Get a large pine packing box, hinge on the lid 
and putty up the cracks, if any, unless you can 
get a box without cracks made of tongue and 
groove lumber. 

Buy a large bottle of cedar oil from a druggist 
and paint the interior of the box thoroughly with 
the oil. Use it generously, let the oil soak well 
into the wood and all crevices. When perfectly 
dry, line the box with cambric and cover the out- 
side with any preferred material, using ornamental 
brass-head tacks. 

The cedar oil will retain the strong odor for a 
long time and it is as moth-proof as the cedar 
wood itself. But if you want the job even more 
permanent you can obtain "cedar-paper" (paper 
treated with cedar oil and also waxed) with which 
you can line the box before putting in the cambric 
lining. 

Cleaning Lamps — (Cornell Reading Course) — 
Apparatus: an old newspaper, the kerosene can, a 
damp flannelette duster, lamp scissors and a dry 
towel. 

Carry the lamps to a sink, or to a table conveni- 
ent to the sink. Spread the paper and place every- 
thing on it. 

Wash and dry the lamp chimneys as if they 
were tumblers, set them aside and put away the 
towel. 

Open up the lamp burner, screw up the wick, 
trim off the char with the scissors, and screw down 
the wick a quarter of an inch below the brass. Be 
careful not to drop the char around. Round wicks 
must have the char rubbed off with the duster. 

Soap one corner of the duster and rub carefully 
every part of the brass burner: if necessary, polish 
as directed for polishing brass. 

Fill each lamp nearly full of kerosene. See that 
the burner is properly screwed on, and wipe the 
body of the lamp carefully. 

Put on the chimneys and set the lamps in their 
places. 

Wash the scissors and duster and hang the duster 
to dry. Gather all trimmings and burn both trim- 
mings and paper. They are not safe to leave 
around. 

Odorless Lamps and Oil Stoves — ^The most fre- 
quent cause of the disagreeable odor from lamps, 
oil heaters, stoves and so on, is the evaporation of 
a bit of oil left on the outside. 

If lamps or heaters remain a day or two un- 
lighted the oil will often soak through the pores, 
or will "climb" the wick and spread outside: they 
should always be carefully wiped off before using, 
as well as just after filling. 



Lamp Cleaning — Take lamp wicks when new 
and soak them in good apple vinegar. Do not 
wring them out but hang near a stove or lay on a 
plate until dry. This treatment will double the 
lighting power of your lamps or lanterns; also with 
wicks prepared this way only one cleaning each 
week is necessary, for the wick will not smoke and 
the chimney and globe will not blacken around 
the top. 

To Save Gas Globes — To avoid the flare, when 
lighting gas, from cracking globe, simply keep a 
small hairpin slipped over the edge of the globe. 
It is not clear just why, but the little wire hairpin 
does the work. 

Picture Stick — Have a smooth, strong stick about 
40 inches long, with a deep notch in one end. 
With this, pictures may be lifted from the wall and 
brushed and replaced without your climbing up 
and dov/n. 

To Remove Staple Run a nail through it and 

catch a claw hammer under nail. 

Disinfect the Telephone The telephone should 

be washed and wiped out every few days, both ear 
and mouthpiece. 

To Renovate Sweeper The sweeper brush 

bristles become soft from long use and do not 
sweep up pieces as well as when new and stiff. Put 
a little common baking soda in some hot water, 
take the brush out of the sweeper and dip it up 
and down in this. Let it dry in the sun and it will 
be like new. Hair bristles of any brush can be 
treated in the same way with the best of results. 

At least once a week the sweeper should be thor- 
oughly cleaned and the brush freed from hair and 

threads. The bearing should be frequently oiled 

the smallest amount being used: a feather will be 
easy for applying the oil. 

Creaking Hinges — should be rubbed with a piece 
of soap; oil spoils looks of the paint. 

Care of Woodwork — Tea water is found an ex- 
cellent cleanser for varnished woodwork. To ob- 
tain this pour water on used tea leaves and strain 
through a cloth or muslin. The tea water removes 
the dirt quite easily. 

White paint should be cleansed with warm water, 
using a trifle whiting on the cloth, then rinsing 
with clear water. 

Clean flannel dipped in paraffin oil will satis- 
factorily remove finger marks on polished or 
painted wood if rubbed on for a few minutes. Wipe 
with a clean cloth wrung from hot water to re- 
move the odor.

THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Section II.— GENERAL UTILITY 



To Clean Windows — (Cornell Reading Course) 
— Apparatus: a high stepladder, fiber tub, damp 
flannelette duster, scrub cloth, soft linen towel, 
chamois leather, ammonia, and warm water. 

Fill the tub half full of warm water and add a 
tablespoonful of ammonia or a few drops of kero- 
sene. 

Carry the ladder to the window, roll up the 
shade and take it down. Unroll it on the floor or 
over a table, then roll it up, dusting both sides as 
it rolls. (See Cleaning Shades, previous Section.) 
Stand it aside, marking to which window it belongs 
if more than one is being cleaned. 

Dust the window, especially the surrounding 
woodwork, with the damp flannelette duster. 

Wash the glass, especially corners, and dry with 
the linen towel. Polish with the chamois leather. 

Replace the shade, testing carefully, and make 
sure the spring works properly. 

Wash out the tub, towel, cloth and duster. Hang 
the cloths to dry and put everything else away. 

If chamois leather is not available use crumpled 
newspaper or tissue; toilet paper is good. 

The following mixture may be used instead of 
ammonia and water, but the resulting white dust 
must be carefully wiped up: 1 tablespoonful pre- 
cipitated whiting; 2 tablespoonfuls household am- 
monia. 

Care of Windows — Instead of cleaning the win- 
dows with soap and water try rubbing them with a 
cloth dipped in a mixture of ammonia and whiting 
and then polish with a clean chamois. This makes 
them much brighter than soap and water. 

To keep windows clean rub with a cloth slightly 
moistened with paraffin or kerosene, afterwards 
polishing with a dry soft duster or chamois leather; 
this prevents flies settling and making marks on 
the glass. 

A cheese cloth dampened with kerosene will 
clean windows quickly when water cannot be ap- 
plied to the glass without freezing. 

To Remove Rust — from curtain rings or other 
small articles, put them in cloudy ammonia for 
half hour and stir them around. If rusted points 
of pins will not push easily through curtains or 
other fabrics, stick them in a bar of soap and they 
will slip easily. 

To Mend a Wire Screen — Take a piece of screen- 
ing large enough for a patch; ravel the edge of 
this patch by taking off several wires on each side 
leaving a fringe of wire points an inch or more 
long. Bend this fringe down at right angles, put 
the patch in position and push the bent fringe 
through. Bend the fringe in and put it against a 
flat board and hammer it gently. The patch will 
hold and insects cannot get through at the edges. 

Cleaning Globes — Globes that have become dis- 
colored from smoke or otherwise may be cleaned 



in the following manner: Soak the globes for about 
an hour in warm water with soda or borax in it; 
then add fresh warm -water with a ievf drops of 
ammonia and wash well with a soaked linen rag. 
This is better than flannel as there are generally 
loose hairs left by flannel unless it is very fine. 
Polish with soft linen rag. 

To Waterproof Matches — Dip them in melted 
paraffin. They strike as well as ever and are not 
ruined by dampness. 

Wobbly Candles in Holder — If ends of candles 
are placed for a moment in hot water, then pressed 
into sockets, they will mold to size and shape and 
thereafter sit snug in the holders. 

Candles Will Last Longer — if given a coat of 
colorless varnish; the wax will not run down 
through — which is an item of appearance as well 
as economy. 

Bayberry Candles To make bayberry candles 

melt the berries for a day, let stand 24 hours, 
strain, then melt a little and pour into candle 
molds, running a wick through each candle. If 
they do not harden perfectly, melt and strain again. 
It requires a great many berries to make a few 
candles. The ^vicking can be had at any hard- 
ware store; it comes in a ball-like twine. 

Scald New Brooms in hot suds before using; 
this will toughen the fibre. Always stand ne^v 
brooms writh the brush end up and the weight ofif 
the fibre. 

Cotton Gloves for Cleaning — Cotton gloves to 
^vear during housework are cooler and better in 
every way than old kid gloves, although the latter 
are serviceable with the fingers cut off. If bought 
especially for this purpose get a size larger than 
usually worn. 

Pockets in Aprons — Have two enormous pocketa 
in work apron. They will save many steps. Inl' 
one room will be many things to be carried into 
another, which put in one pocket. Use the other 
for trash or things to be thrown away. The hands. < 
are free for the cleaning up that is being done. •

WEARING APPAREL 

TEXTILES— THEIR CARE AND USE 

(Extracts from Bulletin Under Above Heading, Iowa State College of Agriculture) 

TESTING MATERIALS 

If one is to buy intelligently, there must be some knowledge of method of 
judging materials. Chemical and microscopic tests determine accurately the con- 
tent and value of materials, but they are not feasible for the average housewife. 
There are many simple tests, however, which can be depended upon to give fairly 
accurate information of standard materials, and with some of these every buyer 
should be somewhat familiar if she is to buy wisely. She should make herself famil- 
iar with the look and feel and weight of standard materials, and although there will 
be variations, if she has learned to judge the quality of some reliable materials, she 
will be able to grade others from those which she knows. 

All textile fabrics are made with two sets of threads. The lengthwise threads 
are known as the warp and crosswise threads as the woof. 

A good way to test the endurance of any material is to take the cloth firmly 
and stretch quickly first warp way and then filling way. If the material tears or frays 
in either direction it shows a lack of strength. 

The strength may also be tested by pushing the warp and woof threads back 
and forth to see if they move easily. If they can be pushed without difficulty and 
are soft and brittle the material will not be strong, and when strain is applied (as 
in seams) it will fray.

Alum ( 1 tablespoonful in I gallon water) . 

As dye materials are made of a great variety of 
chemicals, it is always advisable to test them by 
soaking small pieces of cloth in the above solu- 
tions. 

To insure a perfect color test, the pieces of 
cloth should be left in the various solutions several 
hours or even over night, then dried and the color 
compared with the original color of the fabric. 

Sizing of Cotton 

Cotton being the cheapest of materials, cotton 
cloth is not adulterated with any of the other com- 
mon fibers, but it can be made to appear heavier 
by the addition of mixtures called sizing. Starches, 
gums, dextrine, glue and china-clay, as well as 
other ingredients in varying proportions, constitute 
this sizing, which may add a large per cent, to the 
weight of the cloth. The spaces between the 
threads are filled up and a good finish is given to 
the cloth, although the wearing quality is not in- 
creased. If present in large quantities the cloth is 
greatly reduced in weight and llrniness after the 
first washing. Adulterations of this kind can be 
detected by the feeling, a large quantity imparting 
a harshness to the material. In very thin fabrics 
the sizing may often be detected by holding the 
cloth to the light, when its starch shows between 
the threads. 

Mercerized Cotton 

Cotton is mercerized by treating ordinary cotton 
with strong sodium hydroxide solution with a simul- 
taneous stretching of the fibers. It is then washed 
in water and dilute acid. 

After mercerization the yarn is stronger and 
heavier and it takes dye very readily, but a fiber 
mercerized for the second time shows no further 
affinity for dye stuffs. 

It costs more than twice as much to produce 
mercerized yarn as ordinary yarn. Mercerized cot- 
ton is characterized by a high luster almost like 
silk. 

Cotton may be made to look like mercerized cot- 
ton by passing the cloth under pressure under en- 
graved rollers. This is a means of adulteration. 

Cotton is probably used more than any other 
material for underclothing. It is a good conductor 
of heat and is desirable for summer wear. But 
when it is loosely woven or a pile left on the sur- 
face as in canton Hannel or outing Hannel, it is a 
poor conductor of heat and is desirable for the w^in- 
ter months. The still air in the meshes is a poor 
conductor of heat and the material feels warmer 
because a loosely woven garment holds more air. 

II. LINEN 

The characteristics of linen are: 

1 . Snowy white when bleached. 

2. Strong and durable. 

3. Smooth and glossy when laundered. 

4. Good conductor of heat. 



5. Wrinkles easily. 

6. Water is readily absorbed and evaporated. 

7. It does not retain stains as persistently as cot- 

ton. 

8. It does not leave lint. 

9. Not easily affected by acids. 
I 0. Washes easily. 

Aids in Recognition of Linen 

1 . Wash linen and soak in glycerine. Trans- 
parent if linen, opaque if cotton. 

2. Soak so-called linen material in sulphuric 
acid. The cotton may be v^ashed out, leaving the 
linen fibers. 

3. Wash thoroughly sample of so-called linen 
material in hot soap suds and rinse in hot soft 
water to remove the finishing material. Dry thor- 
oughly and place in hot muriatic acid one minute. 
Transfer quickly to fresh water. If fabric is all cot- 
ton, the sample will drop into minute pieces, while 
if it is linen the shape will remain unchanged. 

4. Tear linen quickly. The threads should be 
smooth along torn edges. Cotton threads curl. 

5. Linen does not burn quite as readily as cot- 
ton. It leaves a small amount of ash. 

6. Wash cloth to remove dressing, dry in fresh 
air. Immerse for two or three minutes in a concen- 
trated solution of sulphuric acid. Cotton under 
this treatment will dissolve almost completely; 
linen remains nearly unaffected. 

7. Equally thick linen and cotton goods exhibit 
considerable difference in v\reight. Linen goods of 
equal volume are about 1 7 per cent, heavier. 

8. Cotton materials feel warmer than linen. 
Cotton by its peculiar structure makes the circu- 
lation of air difficult and holds the heat more than 
linen goods of the same thickness. (From 1 5 to 
30 per cent, more.) 

Absorption Test 

9. Wash a small piece of fringed material from 
dressing. Place it in a 10 per cent, solution of 
copper sulphate and allow it to remain ten minutes. 
Wash thoroughly to remove the adhering surplus 
of copper salt. When thoroughly washed, place 
the material in a 10 per cent, solution of potas- 
sium ferro cyanide. "If the material is half linen 
there appears in the part which consists of flax 
fiber (warp or woof) a striking copper-red color, 
due to the separation of ferro cyanide of copper; 
vfhile the cotton fibers remain uncolored.** 

Oil Test 

1 0. Linen, if freed froni dressing, becomes 
translucent when treated with olive oil; cotton re- 
mains opaque. 

"The linen fiber, because of its thick cell wall, 
assumes a transparent appearance. It appears 
clear against the light, and dark when light falls 
upon it. The opposite effect is noticed in cotton."

III. WOOL 

The characteristics of wool are: 

1 . Not a good conductor of heat. 

2. Readily affected by heat and sudden changes 
in temperature. 

3. Difficult to launder. 

4. Readily affected by friction. 

5. Very elastic. 

6. Absorbs a large amount of moisture; 12 to 
I 7 per cent, of its own weight under ordinary con- 
dition and 30 to 50 per cent, in very damp weather. 

Wool is very curly» and possesses a scaly struc- 
ture in a much more niarked degree than hair, in 
which the external scales lie flat. The scales on 
wool fiber stand up when moist and warm like the 
scales on a pine cone, and when cold and dry or 
cold and moist, lie fiat like the scales on a fish. 

The scales are of a gelatinous material and be- 
come soft under heat and moisture, and if pressure 
is applied the scales lock permanently together and 
the cloth is reduced in length and width and is 
shrunken. 

A seventy-two-inch material may be shrunken or 
felted to fifty-four inches, and there may be in a 
closely felted wool fiber three thousand scales to 
the inch. 

Sponging and Shrinking 

All woolen materials should be sponged either 
at the shop or at home before they are made up. 
Sponging not only prevents the garment from spot- 
ting, but keeps it from shrinking unevenly in wet 
weather. 

For sponging, the selvedges should be cut off or 
the edges clipped to prevent their drawing when 
the material shrinks. The ironing board should 
be covered smoothly with two or three thicknesses 
of blanket and two of cotton sheeting. Lay the 
material face downward, or if it is a double width 
fabric, it may be folded in the center, right side in. 

Take a piece of sheeting a little longer than the 
width of the material and three-quarters of a yard 
wide, wet it, wring it dry and lay it smoothly over 
the suiting. Press several times with a hot iron, 
remove the damp cloth and substitute a dry one, 
pressing it until the suiting is dry. Never use a 
coarse fabric for pressing, as it will leave the im- 
print of the weave upon the material. Keep the 
iron moving or it will leave its mark. Do not 
press hard. This will push the material in folds in 
front of the iron and will stretch the cloth. 

Adulteration of Wool 

The demand for woolen cloth far exceeds the 
supply of new wool and it is necessary to resort 
to various measures to increase the supply of cloth. 

In adulterating a material the manufacturer 
seeks a material cheaper than the fiber he wishes 
to adulterate, one which can be concealed readily. 



Wool when combined with cheaper cotton fibre 
makes a material v^hich wears well, but does not 
keep its shape as well as all-wool cloth. Because 
of the felting property of wool it is quite possible 
to conceal a good deal of cotton. 



Shoddy 

Wool is used over and over again. The best all- 
wool rags are selected to produce fibers, which are 
respun and again woven either separately if of 
very good quality, or mixed with new wool or 
cotton. Such a material is warm, looks well for a 
time and has a place, but must not be bought for 
new wool or demand the price of good woolen 
cloth. 

One class of shoddy consists of very short fibers, 
clippings from the mills, which are worked into 
the surface of a felted cloth after it is woven. These 
clippings after a time work out and are found in 
the bottom of coats, inside linings, etc., leaving the 
surface of the cloth threadbare. 



Woolen and Worsteds 

"Various distinctions are given between these 
two yarns; viz., that woolen is made from short 
wool and worsted from long wool, and that woolen 
is carded and worsted combed. While both of 
these statements are to a certain extent true, the 
real distinction lies in the fact that woolen thread 
has its fibers running in many directions, more or 
less tangled, while worsted thread has its fibers 
quite parallel. Since woolen cloths are quite largely 
felted, this crisscrossing in every direction leaves 
many loose ends of fibers exposed on its surface to 
mat together and form a compact material. 
Worsted, on the other hand, usually sho^vs the 
threads of the weave, and therefore needs to have 
the ends of the threads held in place, so as not to 
produce a felted or rough surface. The short 
fibers seem best suited for v^roolen and the long 
fibers for worsted. The processes used to bring 
about these two results are quite different."

Tests for Wool 

Pure wool will dissolve in a solution of lye. 



2. Detect wool from shoddy by means of micro- 
scope. 

3. Determination of cotton in wool; boil sam- 
ple in a five per cent, solution of caustic potash 
fifteen minutes. Wool is destroyed. 

4. Funchin dye turns wool a deep pink, leav- 
ing the cotton white. (This is most effective when 
used on flannel having a cotton warp with a wool 
filling.) 

IV. SILK 

The characteristics of silk are: 
1 . Poor conductor of heat. 

Absorbs moisture readily. 

Friction weakens the materials. 

Careless washing destroys the gloss. 

It scorches easily. 

Strong and tenacious. (Tensile strength 
"64,000 lbs. per square inch.") 

7. Pure silk wears well. 

8. Silk is soft and light in weight. 

9. A good generator, but a poor conductor of 
electricity. 

I 0. Easily dyed. 

Fibers injured by high degree of heat or 
changes of temperature. 
Absorbs moisture readily. 

"Silk, frequently known as the fiber of K'X- 
ury." It bleaches and dyes beautifully and com- 
bines well with other fibers, both animal and vege- 
table. The cost of raw silk is about thirty times 
that of raw cotton and the waste in weaving at 
least five times that of cotton. 

Silk has a very great ability to absorb metallic 
salts, and there is practically no silk on the market 
to-day that is entirely free from metallic salts, but 
there is a great difference in the amount present. 

Pongee is a material made from the cocoon of 
the uncultivated silk worm; rajah, tussah, and 
other uneven, coarse materials are from the same 
source. These silks are very strong, but do not 
have a high luster. 



1 I. 

udder 
12. 



Tests for Silk 

1. Indications of adulteration: 

Pin holes in nev^r silk; weighted with metallic 
salts. (One pound of raw silk will make 
two or three pounds of weighted silk.) 

2. Test for weighing: 

Will burn easily if not weighted, will retain 
its shape if weighted. 

3. Test for silk and cotton: 

Strong alkali will dissolve silk and will leave 
the cotton. 



Summary of Adulteration Methods 

1 . By combination. Use of other fibers than 
the one indicated by the name of the material. 
Example, cotton in woolens, cotton in linens, etc. 

2. By substitutions. Selling one fiber under 
the name of an entirely different one. Example, 
mercerized cotton sold for silk, or linen. 

3. By increasing the weight of a material, 
(a) Cottons and linens with starch; (b) Silks with 
metallic salts and dyes. 

4. By giving a finish which is deceptive. (a) 
Heavy pressing or calendaring an ordinary cotton 
to imitate mercerizing. (b) Finishing cotton to 
look like linen. (c) Printing paste dots on cotton 
to produce the effect of embroidered dotted Swiss. 

5. By use of made-over yarns. Example: 
Shoddy in woolens, also addition of short wool, 
felted in surface. 

When women demand a better quality of n>ate- 
rials and refuse to buy the cheap things, the manu- 
facturers will cease to produce worthless things. 
Perhaps, however, before that day arrives the 
thoughtful workers of the land will have succeeded 
in passing a pure textile la^v, which will do for 
our cloth what the pure food act is doing for our 
food supplies. 

At the present time the rush to the bargain 
counter, the enormous amount of cheap, poor ma- 
terial manufactured, the catering to fads, novelties 
and the great v^raste in dress all go to prove that 
there are many women who are not intelligent 
buyers. 



THE CARE OF WOOLENS 

It is a matter of economy that every householder should know how to have 
woolens light, soft and clean — both clothing and household furnishings. They will 
keep twice as long and not shrink and harden but remain as soft as when new. 

We shall not touch here on the laundering of woolens, however, but refer 
you to Section IX, "The Laundry," where the washing and caring for woolens, 
blankets, sweaters, etc., is thoroughly covered. Read carefully the article under that 
section.

CARE OF OTHER APPAREL 



MISCELLANEOUS 

Restoring Velvet When you get caught in a 

rain shower or sno\vstorm with your new velvet 
hat on, it certainly is not pleasing to your disposi- 
tion. However, if measures are taken at once no 
harm is done to the hat. Take several old hand- 
kerchiefs or a piece of soft cloth and pat the 
water out of the hat. When most of it on the out- 
side has been gotten off in this manner rub with 
a dry cloth until the velvet is quite dry. Put hat 
where it will be thoroughly dry over night, and 
next morning brush it hard with a clothes brush. 
Finally use a hat or velvet brush and you will find 
that your hat looks as well as it did before it got 
wet. 

Spotted Velvet To restore the color of velvet 

that has become spotted by rain, steam the whole 
surface to make the shade even. Do not brush 
before steaming. The velvet will look darker at 
first but it will soon become lighter in the open 
air. 

To Clean Furs — Furs may be cleaned by the fol- 
lowing process; warm some bran in a saucepan, 
keeping it well stirred so that it does not burn. 
Rub this well into the fur several times until there 
is no dirt on the bran; then shake the fur thor- 
oughly. 

Brushing Velvets Besides the ordinary clothes 

brush it is well to always keep a piece of velvet 
or velveteen to be used for dusting ribbons, velvets, 
hat trimmings and other articles of silk. It will 
be found far better for the purpose than any brush. 
For dusting velvet or velveteen an excellent brush, 
better than one of bristles, is made by rolling up a 
piece of crepe, which need not be new, into a con- 
venient little bundle. 

A Petticoat Hint — Put on a china silk dust ruffle 
in place of the cotton one usually found on the 
average priced silk petticoat. It reduces friction, 
makes the skirt wear longer, sheds the dust instead 
of holding it as the cotton ruffle does, washes 
nicely, and if good quality will outlast two petti- 
coats. 

To Curl Feathers — Take a round stick of any 
kind; hold feather close to it and carefully fold 
the down around the wood, not close. Slip over 
it a small bag made to fit loosely over the stick and 
feathers. Hold in steam from a kettle till well 
dampened; then put in a warm spot till perfectly 
dry; the feather will be nicely curled without dam- 
age to its texture. 

To Keep Rubber Articles — Bathing caps and 
other rubber goods can be kept fresh and new by 
giving them a **bath'* of talcum powder, when dry, 
after use. 



CARE OF SHOES 
When putting away shoes over season, unless 
properly taken care of, you will be sadly disap- 
pointed. AH shoes are more or less damp with 
perspiration, and as they dry out the toes turn up 
and deep wrinkles settle across the leather. Here 
is the remedy: Brush well, removing every particle 
of dust, rub with vaseline, pack full of crushed 
paper, wrap with paper and pack away. 

Waterproofing Shoes — The following are two 
home methods of waterproofing shoes and leather. 
Mix eight parts linseed oil, ten parts boiled oil, 
eight parts suet and eight of beeswax by heating 
them over a slow fire. Warm the leather to be 
treated, and with a brush apply the warm mixture 
to it, making sure to coat the seams carefully. Or; 
melt together over a slow fire one part white pine 
tar, one part Neat's foot oil, and one of beef tallow. 
Apply this mixture as above. 

To Polish Damp Shoes — Mix a few drops of 
paraffin with the blacking and the shoes will take 
the polish at once. 

To Polish Wet Boots — Dry the boots or shoes 
thoroughly, but slowly. Don't put them in an 
oven, unless watched closely; they will burn or 
warp easily. Rub the surface of the leather with 
a raw potato; set aside until once more dry. Then 
polish in usual manner. 

To Clean Tan Shoes — Put them on shoe-trees 
and scrub them with a stiff brush with soap and 
water. This removes every bit of the polish, the 
spots with it, and when you polish them again you 
can hardly recognize them as not new. 

Too Much Tan — A coating of thick castor oil 
applied with a soft flannel cloth to exaggerated 
colored tan shoes will tone down their vividness 
considerably. 

To Bronze Rubbers Black rubbers can be 

bronzed by simply painting with the same polish 
used for the brown shoes you want them to niatch. 

A New Shoe which hurts the feet. Put on a 
stocking and dip foot in water. Slip on the shoe 
and walk in it a few moments. You will have no 
more trouble. 

To Stop Squeaking of Shoes — Raise the inner 
lining of the sole and cover the sole liberally with 
toilet powder, then replace the lining. Repeat if 
required. 

Squeaky Shoes — Try dipping the soles in kero- 
sene. 

White Belt — A good method to clean this is to 
rub powdered borax in gently with a piece of white 
flannel.

THE SEWING ROOM 

TO SHRINK LINENS 

To shrink linens, and similar wash-goods ; lay the material in folds of a yard, 
then baste all the selvedges together on one side, leaving other selvedges free. Then 
baste at each end through all the folds. Fold the goods now so it will lie smoothly 
in the vessel to be used, without crushing. Fill the vessel with cold water sufficiently 
to cover the goods and leave the material immersed for about half an hour; wring- 
ing out lightly without creasing. 

Hang the basted end to a line, and pull and straighten w^ith the hands until 
smooth and uniform ; fold one corner crosswise to another to see if the sides regis- 
ter straight, slip the hands up and outward between the free selvedges until all the 
folds are smooth. 

When almost dry remove the bastings on the ends and assist the drying by 
shaking and shaping. Crease the folds to show the yards lengths. When entirely 
dry, the material should look like new ; in all likelihood no ironing will be neces- 
sary. 

SEWING-ROOM HINTS 



The Sewing Machine does not always need more 
oil when it will not work easily, it may be gummed 
with old oil, or may be only "cold." Place it near 
a fire or in a very warm room; this will melt the 
oil and enable you to see if gummed with old oil; 
if so, wipe off the gummed parts before oiling 
anew. 

To Tighten a Belt Instead of stopping work to 

take off belt and shorten it, slip a few small rubber 
bands over the small wheel; they will give the loose 
belt "purchase" until you have time for the per- 
manent correction. 

When belt first begins to loosen too much, oil the 
band with a little castor oil and turn the handle of 
the machine rapidly; this will shrink the leather 
and shorten the belt, and at the same time improve 
the leather itself. 

Slipping Garments — To prevent garments slip- 
ping off the leaf of the machine while stitching 
heavy goods, slip an old pillow case over the leaf 
and pin it tight. If sewing dark material use a 
dark cloth if the lint off the slip adheres to the 
goods. 

A fine steel crochet hook is most useful about a 
machine for removing dust, lint, threads and 
gummed oil in corners. 

To remove machine oil from a white garment, 
rub with chalk as soon as possible, leave for a 
short time, then brush and the spot will disappear. 

Home-made Bust Form — Take a well-fitted lining 
and stitch and press it and sew hooks and eyes 



down front. Bind neck with tape to prevent stretch- 
ing. Take an ordinary feather bed pillow, stand 
on end and fit the lining around it, work the pil- 
low into the lining until every corner is filled out. 
It will make a duplicate of your own form sufficient 
for all practical purposes for draping and fitting, 
pinning and sewing, and will save you many an 
hour of standing fatigued while some one assists 
you in the arduous fitting process. 

When sewing braid on the bottom of a skirt, 
insert a small piece of cardboard between the hem, 
moving it along as you proceed, and you will save 
much time and temper. 

Pearl Buttons may be fastened on a dress by 
pinning them on from the inside with very small 
safety pins; they can thus be removed for washing. 

Buttonhole Hint — In making buttonholes in very 
soft material, rub a little flour and water paste on 
the underside. It will stiffen and give a firm sur- 
face, also prevent cutting the hole too large, and 
vv'ill not discolor the fabric. 

Ball and Socket Snaps Sew the ball snap on the 

upper piece. The back of this is flat and will leave 
no mark on outside; the socket snap would leave 
a round mark in the centre, particularly noticeable 
on smooth-finished goods. 

Knotting a Thread — Do you appreciate the sim- 
ple fact that if you tie the knot, after threading a 
needle, always in the end of the thread just snipped 
from the spool, you will avoid that troublesome 
kinking you have often encountered?

In mentling a rent, in a delicate muslin or other

Novel Mending — Wool or silk: carefully smooth 
the frayed part, then moisten a piece of the mate- 
rial with very thin mucilage and put a heavy weight 
upon it until it dries; the mended place can be less 
easily detected than if darned or mended.

The woman of fine sensibilities does not need her love of beautiful table 
appointments stimulated. It is instinctive to desire and appreciate the "home- 
making" value of the crisp, fresh beauty of spotless napery and the gleam of pol- 
ished glass and silver. She joys as much in the observance of the principles of 
decorative appearance in the furnishing, arrangement and appointment of her table 
as she does in that of the rest of the house. 

But we have bought our table covers without regard for table china, and our 
table china without regard to our other implements and materials, and we use the 
same old things day after day with little thought of studied variety and harmonious 
combinations. We are usually handicapped at the outset with an ill-assorted jumble 
of wedding presents of no relation one to another. And we start off wrong, as a 
rule, from a natural pride in these gifts, by displaying the finest of them, and as 
many of them, as often as we can, without thouj^ht of inharmonies. 

It would be a hopeless task to attempt here to tell one what is right and 
what is wrong. If one has no ear for music it is a long, tedious process to learn, 
and only the one who wants to learn can by close application master real harmony 
and know^ real beauty and perfection and produce it. 

But the harmony of appearance is as essential as any other item of "home- 
making." Study your table. Learn what brings about the beauty of softness, 
simplicity and consistency. Do the best you can with your "wedding presents" 
by adding to them intelligently from time to time, as you find you inevitably have 
to add various new appointments. Withhold what you have, however beautiful 
in itself, until you can use it in fit surroundings in combinations that make a 
whole note. 

And remember above all, that much "fancy stuff" is now altogether passe, 
and overloading is eggregious sinfulness. By staying close to simplicity many 
combinations become appropriate and harmonious; the elaborate or unusual v/ill 
clash in almost any setting you can plan.

A few flowers, or a little living green thing, is almost without exception 
tasteful and quite as important as the forks and spoons. It may be a Japanese 
dwarf-tree or a single flower or sprig of evergreen, but if properly set it lifts the 
thought subtly from meat and drink and cheers the whole tone of things as uncon- 
sciously and successfully as the bit of cheerful conversation which is itself as essen- 
tial a part of a meal as the buttered bread. 

Thank the gods of good taste that the time has passed when we sat down to 
the table loaded with one glory of silverware and one glory of glassware and one 
glory of chinaware and one glory of linenware, and each glory out-glorifying every 
other in its glory. We spread now a feast of simple wholesomeness for the eye as 
well as for the palate, and each helps with the perfect assimilation of the other. 

TABLE LINEN 

(Iowa State College) 

Linen is sometimes called the textile of luxury, but there is no textile so 
quickly cleaned, so fine, or so durable for constant service. Linen is expensive 
because of the slow process of manufacturing. 

Within a few years the weaving of linen has increased in the United States. 

Irish linen is noted for its endurance, reliable quality and snowy whiteness. 
It still holds a high reputation, and its manufacture dates back to the thirteenth cen- 
tury, and Belfast is the center of the industry. Much of the linen in Ireland is grass 
bleached. The designs are simple; many of the old patterns are still used. 

Scotch linen is silver white in color and is grass bleached. It is moderate in 
price; the designs are generally more elaborate than the Irish. 

French damask is noted for its exquisite and effective designs. The threads 
are fine and round and especial attention is given to the beauty of the finish. 

German linen is silver white and of high grade. The finest grades are not 
exported as much as the medium grades. 

During the period of the shortage of linen and consequently high prices of 
table linen, it is wise to save as much as possible by the use of other materials. 
Many housekeepers find it an economy as well as a convenience, which saves labor 
in w^ashing, to use the squares and runners of Japanese towling, w^hich are to be had 
at reasonable prices and in attractive designs. 



THE DINING ROOM— THE TABLE BEAUTIFUL 



41 



TABLE SETTING 

(Iowa State College of Agriculture) 
Diagram Showing Arrangement of Single Cover 




Whether a meal is simple or elaborate much of its success depends on the 
care with which the dishes are placed on the table. 

Silence Cloth — Cover the table with a silence cloth, which may consist of 
table padding, a thin white blanket or heavy cotton flannel. 

Table Cloth — The cloth should be large enough to fall from ten to twelve 
inches below the edge of the table. It should be placed with the center of the cloth 
exactly in the center of the table. 

Silver — The knife and fork for the main course mark the cover. They are 
placed one inch from edge of table, knife at the right with sharp edge toward the 
plate; fork at left, tines turned up. The other pieces of silver are parallel with 
these, and placed with the piece to be used first farthest from the plate. The knives 
and spoons are at right and the forks at the left. 

Glaiss — The glass is placed at the tip of the knife. 

The Butter Plate — The butter plate is placed at the tip of the fork, and a little 
to the left. 

The Napkin — The napkin is placed at the left of the forks with the folds at 
the upper and left-hand sides. 

General Rules — Serve hostess first. 

Place and remove from right. 

Pass to left. 

Everything relating to a course should be removed at the end of that course. 

Folded napkin and small tray should be used in serving. 

Fill glass three-quarters full just before meal is announced. 

Butter, relishes, etc., can be on the table when the guests are seated. 

Soiled dishes should be removed first, then food, next clean dishes, etc. 

Place all knives and spoons to the right. 

Place all forks to the left with the exception of the oyster fork, which is 
placed at the extreme right. 

The guests stand behind or beside their chairs, and are seated from the left 
when the hostess gives the signal.

DINING ROOM EQUIPMENT AND ITS CARE 



Attractive Trays Buy a ten-cent picture frame 

of depth and size desired; buy two handles and 
screws, and insert under the glass some pretty 
cretonne or chintz or a bit of lace where the pic- 
ture belongs. You have a very attractive little tray 
for dining service; or it is suitable in smaller sizes 
for pin-tray on a dresser. 

Napkin Rings for Guests — Take brass curtain 
rings and wind them with satin ribbon, in different 
colors, and put them away for guest use when 
needed. A set of small gold initials containing all 
letters of the alphabet in tiny paper stickers may 
be obtained for a small sum; you can thus decorate 
the guest's napkin with his or her initial, during 
the visit, a cheerful touch that adds much to the 
atmosphere of a sincere and spontaneous welcome. 
Table Mats made from white pyramid rubber 
matting such as is made for automobiles is better 
than asbestos mats to protect from hot dishes and 
are readily cleaned and kept white with chalk. 
Covers of linen may be used with them if desired. 

To Clean Silver — (Cornell Reading Course) 

Apparatus: a bottle of silver polish, a small piece 
of old, soft cloth, a clean flannel or flannelette 
cloth, a plate brush, and a clean chamois skin. 

Shake the polish bottle thoroughly, wet the old 
cloth with the polish, and rub all the silver all over 
with it. Then wash the mouth and cork of the 
bottle and cork the bottle tightly. When cleaning 
a large amount of silver pour the polish in a small 
saucer to use. 

When the whiting is dry on the silver, rub off 
as much as possible vv^ith the flannel cloth. 
Bruch the whiting out of cracks and 
with the plate brush. 

Polish with the chamois. If necessai 
wards, wash the chamois. 

Recipe for Silver Polish (Cornell Reading 

Course) — Take 1 cup methylated spirit (wood 
alcohol), 2 tablespoonfuls household ammonia, |4 
cup precipitated whiting. Mix the ingredients and 
keep in a closely corked bottle. Shake thoroughly 
before using. 

Note: The silver polish should be of the consist- 
ency of milk -when used. 

Cleaning Silver — If silver is never washed with 
soap it will retain its lustre. Hold under hot faucet 
and use unsoaped mop, then polish with chamois 
skin. 

Keeping Silver — Large pieces of silver, such as 
urns, pitchers, baskets, fruit dishes, should be kept 
in canton flannel bags, nap inside, the bag closed 
with draw strings. Packed in dry flour, silver will 
not tarnish. 

Another Polish — Beat the white of an egg to a 
stiff froth, add enough soda to make a stiff paste. 



afte 



Wash the silver first, and thoroughly dry it, then 
rub with the paste until all dark places disappear; 
rinse in cold water and dry -with chamois. 

When Cleaning Knives mix a little soda with the 
bathbrick for a polish. 

Broken China Cement — Take 4 oz. clear gum- 
arabic, dissolve in 6 oz. of rain or distilled water; 
add 6 oz. best cane sugar and 3 oz. best white 
starch. Let the "whole dissolve, put in a jar, stand 
in a pan of water and boil until the starch becomes 
clear; as it cools add a ie-w drops essence of cloves. 
Keep tightly corked. 

For mending delicate china and ornaments there 
is nothing better than rice-flour or ground rice 
mixed with cold water thoroughly and simmered 
over a slow fire until thickened. It can be used hot 
or cold, and is a most durable adhesive. 

Metal and Glass Cement — Common alum melted 
in an iron spoon over hot coals makes a very 
strong cement for joining metal and glass. 

Washing Glassware Glassware should be 

^vashed only in warm water, either clean or ^vith 
pure white soapsuds, using a stiff brush and clean 
cuttings. Never rub soap directly on glass. Rinse 
in clear water, and for drying use linen towels 
kept especially for, this purpose. Glass dried by 
placing in clean, fine boxwood sawdust takes on a 
greater lustre. 

To preserve lustre and to brighten dingy glass, 
add a little ammonia or bluing to the ^vater in 
which it is washed, and after drying polish with 
very soft chamois or silk handkerchief. 

Glass decanters may be cleaned by partly filling 
with Vi'arm water and fine-chopped pieces of raw 
potato; shake up and down for a few minutes, then 
rub over inside with sponge tied to end of a stick; 
dry -with soft cloth in same manner. If decanters 
are very soiled the potato peelings should remain 
in the bottle over night before washing out. Shot 
is frequently poured into glass bottles to clean in- 
side, but is apt to leave scratches. 

V/hen paint sticks to glass it can be removed 
%vith hot vinegar. 

To polish cut glass wash it well with soapsuds, 
rinse and then after drying it with a cloth, polish 
it with sawdust and a leather, and the glass will 
be brilliant. 

To Whiten Ivory Knife Handles Cut a lemon in 

half, dip it into common kitchen salt and rub over 
the handles. This will remove the dirty yellow 
look and make the ivory as bright and ^vhite as 

Cheese-Cloth "Towels" for silver and glassware 
will be found more desirable than crash as they 
are free from lint. 



THE REFRIGERATOR 

Care of Refrigerator — Nothing is more important in the household than 
keeping the refrigerator free and sweet and clean from offensive odors. There is 
no point in housekeeping where watchfulness and nicest care are so important. A 
good housekeeper will have her refrigerator cleaned at least once a week, if not 
more. This is best accomplished in the morning before the iceman comes. No 
woman should trust this matter wholly tici a servant, however careful the latter may 
be, for the health of her family is directly involved. 

To Clean Refrigerator — (Cornell Reading Course) — Apparatus: two dishpans, the 
trap brush, a small scrub brush, two dishcloths, a clean towel, soap, washing soda, and 
ammonia. 

Empty the water pan below and replace it. 

Fill the sink or a dishpan half full of strong, hot soapsuds. Put warm water into 
a dishpan to the depth of an inch and add a half tablespoonful ammonia. 

Remove the ice to the other dishpan, using the dishcloths to prevent its slipping. 
Gather up any straws or dirt. 

Remove all food. Put the ice-rack and the shelves into the soapsuds. 

Wash the ice-box carefully and quickly \fith the ammonia water. Be sure to get all 
the corners clean, and scrub the waste pipe with the trap brush. Rinse it down with the 
ammonia water and then with a dipperful of fresh, clean water. Dry with the dishcloth 
wrung out of clean water. 

If the waste pipe is movable, take it out of the food closet and put it in the soap- 
suds. Scrub the ice-rack and the shelves with the scrub brush, and the pipe with the trap 
brush. Let off the suds, rinse the pieces in plenty of cold water, and dry with the towel. 

Replace the ice-rack and the ice, and close the ice-box doors. 

Mix a fresh lot of ammonia water, and wash the walls and the floor of the food 
closet. Be sure the corners are clean. Dry with the tow^el. Be very sure that movable 
parts belonging to the waste pipe are taken apart, washed thoroughly, and carefully fitted 
back into place. Then replace the waste pipe and the shelves. 

Replace the food but do not close the doors. 

Wash out the pipe cap under the refrigerator most carefully with the ammonia 
water and soap. 

Empty the water pan and wash it thoroughly, with plenty of soap in the ammonia 
water, before replacing it. 

Close the refrigerator doors. Wash out and put away the dishpan, brushes and 
cloths. 

Dangerous if Unsanitary — If the shelves and bottom of the refrigerator are wiped 
every day with a cloth wet in soda and water this will tend to keep it purified. The waste 
pipe must be kept open and clean. It should never connect with a general drain pipe; such 
an arrangement often results in the actual poisoning of foods in the box, in spite of water 
traps and other precautions. A saucer of powdered charcoal placed on the shelf or a piece 
of charcoal placed in the refrigerator, and renewed every three or four days, absorbs odors 
and keeps the air pure.

44 THE HOM E-KEEPING BOOK— Section III.— REFRIGERATO R 

If the refrigerator is kept in the cellar, the cellar should be frequently inspected, kept 
clean and well-aired, and if possible white-washed once or twice a year. A musty, damp, 
and ill-ventilated cellar is dangerous to health in any case. 

Dishes on Ice in refrigerator should have a small rubber mat under them and they 
will not slip as the ice melts. Preserve-jar rubber rings may be used for the purpose.

THE RELATIVE VALUE OF FOODS 

Do you know the relative value of the foods you are feeding your family? 
Do you know whether the meals administered to-day yield as much nourishment 
as the ones of yesterday? It is a part of the education of every thorough house- 
wife to know^ just how one food compares with another as to its nutritiousness. 
The woman who has no comprehension of this often feeds her family for one 
week meals with too much protein, making them feel heavy and stupid, w^hile the 
whole of next week's meals may not contain as much real value as one single 
menu from the preceding week. 

A Chart Necessary. — You should consult frequently your chart of food values, 
and when you go out of a morning to do your marketing consider your chart before you 
decide on the menus for the day, so that they will contain the proper amount of nourish- 
ment. 

Fats contain more energy than any other food, but their work is slow. The fats we 
consume go to make up the storehouse of our physical strength. We do not feel any imme- 
diate after-effect from eating a pork chop, a few slices of bacon or a good bit of butter, but 
this fat enters the storehouse of our bodies and stays there until needed. It is the strength 
from the fatty foods that we draw upon in time of illness. When we cannot eat for any 
length of time the body lives upon the energy laid up in reserve from the fats we have 
taken into our systems. 

Meats, however, contain the energy for our daily use. We need a daily amount of 
meats, fish or eggs, all of which hold the same kind of strength. The energy in meats lasts 
through one day, but needs replenishing for the next. 

Vegetables are as necessary as the meats and fats. Without them our bodies would 
become clogged from the fats and the circulation too violent from the meats. Vegetables 
serve to clear the system and to calm the blood. 

Mineral Salts — Such vegetables as spinach, celery, onions, carrots, etc., and such 
fruits as rhubarb, cranberries, etc., contain the necessary mineral salts which act as tonics 
and laxatives. Each one has its special office and its own particular value. Spinach, for 
instance, contains a great deal of iron; onions and celery are nerve foods; rhubarb takes the 
place of "sulphur and molasses" for clearing the blood, and cranberries are an excellent tonic. 

Making Up Menus — In making up the menus, therefore, you must be careful to have 
them balance evenly. You should not have too much fat one day, too much starch the 
next. The menus for one day should hold part of each kind of food — one meat (fish or 
eggs), one fat, one starch, one tonic vegetable and one laxative or fruit. 



MEAT EATERS OR VEGETARIANS? 

For many hundreds of years the argument has been bandied back and 
forth as to whether we best subsist on a meat or vegetable diet. It is about as 
absurd as whether we should wear hats or shoes. Each has its place. It is not a 
matter of classification but of what the respective foods contain and how^ they are 
balanced as to their ingredients. 

The most vehement partisan of the meat diet will admit that flesh is not indispens- 
able to our existence. And it is well known that the original Indian inhabitants of this 
country subsisted for many months at a time, in perfect health, solely on "pemmican" — dried 

49 



50 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Section IV.— Part 1— TALKS ON FOODS 

buffalo meat. The Esquimaux can live entirely on whale blubber; they could not subsist 
on the exclusive fruit diet of the tropics. Thus climate has its influence. We of the temper- 
ate zones may well employ, on this argument, a mixed diet, of both meats and vegetables. 

It is of no moment that the rabid advocate of each extreme can point to any number 
of exceptional cases, to prove his contentions — and to equally numerous ones of ill results 
from adherence to the diet the particular extremist seeks to condemn. 

But it is not so much a question of whether the source of the food is meat or vege- 
tables; the food itself is the albumen, fats, salts, etc., that are extracted in the process of 
digestion. 

Nature has made albumen the staple of nutrition for man. Fruit albumen is some- 
what more assimilible than meat albumen. Hence fruit forms nearly a perfect food, espe- 
cially as it also furnishes acids and salts which are much needed, in better proportions than 
meats. 

As to breads, a series of experiments show that in equal portions of 1 00 ounces more 
of white bread is digested than brown bread, but the proportions of proteids, which are 
the muscle-forming contents, 85 Y2 ounces out of 1 00 is digested from white bread against 
88 '/4 from brown bread. The brown bread is therefore more valuable in the item of digest- 
ibility of its protein contents; and it is well understood that whole-wheat and graham 
breads contain the intensely valuable mineral salts which are largely or wholly "refined" 
out of the most of our white bread in the flour-making process. 

Nuts are an excellent diet if well masticated. They are highly valuable as nut but- 
ter or nut oils. They contain a large percentage of proteids as well as fats, in almost perfect 
purity. They are deficient in starch, but so are meats. Nuts will take the place of meats to 
perfection. But nuts must be masticated thoroughly — something seldom done with nuts. 
And they are really too concentrated to constitute an exclusive diet; they do not give the 
digestive functions proper exercise. Nature demands a certain amount of bulk, especially in 
the intestinal canal to excite peristalsis and stimulate bowel movement. 

Vegetables best furnish this bulk — also the mineral salts needed for the toning up 
of the blood, and whole wheat bread, because of the bran, is of value in this regard — the 
stimulation of peristalsis. 

Food Ingredients are classified in four divisions: 1, Proteins; 2, Fats; 3, Starches, 
or Carbohydrates; 4, Mineral Salts. The classification is more clearly and specifically sub- 
divided as per chart on page opposite.

THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Section IV.— Part 1 —TALKS ON FOODS 



PROTEIN FOODS 

The first class of foods, the proteinst includes 
those which have tissue building for their chief pur- 
pose. They are essential for maintenance and for 
body growth as they are the only source of nitro- 
gen. Therefore they are necessary for the growng 
child and for the athlete in the development of 
strong, vigorous muscles. The more easily digested 
protein foods are advised for the tubercular patient 
whose muscles and tissues have become debilitated 
by disease. 

Proteins are required by each individual but in 
varying amounts, to suit age, occupation, condition 
of system, and climate. The value of a mixed pro- 
tein diet is urged by the best authorities, rather 
than the diet w^hich contains but one protein food. 

OVER USE OF PROTEIN FOODS 

It is true that a high per cent, of illness is caused 
by an accumulation of wastes in the body. It is 
also true that protein foods leave a higher per cent, 
of w^aste material in the body than any other class 
of foods. It follow^s, then, that an over-use of pro- 
tein foods overw^orks the excretory organs and 
tends to weaken them. The weakened excretory 
organs are unable to take care of the waste prod- 
ucts, and as a result the system is affected by poi- 
sonous w^astes w^hich are produced by putrefaction 
in the intestines. A person in this condition is 
more liable to have rheumatism, gout, kidney and 
liver diseases than one in normal condition. 



A SHORT STUDY OF PROTEIN FOODS 

Some Sources 

Eggs 



Some Common Forms 

Albumen 

Casein 

Myosin, fibrin and elastin 

Gluten 

Tuberin 

Legumin 

Excelsin 

Zein 



Milk 

Meat 

Wheat 

Potato 

Peas and beans 

Brazil nuts 

Corn 



Milk contains a small amount of protein. In a 
glass of about I 2 tablespoons of milk, there is less 
than I tablespoon of protein. 

Egg contains nearly as much protein as lean 
meat. 

Fish and meat are approximately equal so far as 
amount of protein and digestibility are concerned. 
Experiments show^ very little difiference. 

Cheese varies in protein content from 18 to 25 
per cent. Cheese is a valuable food but should be 
used wisely. It is not the food for children or for 
those of delicate digestion. 

Peas^ dried, contain 24.6 per cent, of protein. 
Green peas, cooked, contain 6.7 per cent. 

Lima beans, dried, contain 1 8. 1 per cent. ; green 
lima beans, 7. 1 per cent. 



Wheat contains protein in the form of gluten. 
Bread flour contains more of gluten than pastry 
flour. 

IMPORTANT STEPS IN DIGESTION 
OF PROTEIN 

Proteins. 

Meta proteins. 

Proteoses. 

Peptones. 

Peptids. 

Amino-acids. 

The action of digestive agents results in the 
final breaking dow^n into the simple "building 
stones" called amino acids. They are spoken of 
as "building stones" because they are stored away 
and used in the building of new protein tissue. 
The digestion of proteins is a complex process and 
cannot be accomplished except with perfect co- 
operation between the digestive, circulatory, ex- 
cretory, respiratory, and nervous systems. 

FATS AND CARBOHYDRATES 
(Chief Fuel Foods) 

Under this head consideration will first be given 
to the class of foods spoken of in the outline as fats. 
These foods produce heat-energy in the body, very 
much as wood and coal produce heat in the stove. 
Fats and carbohydrates are also of value as fatty 
tissue builders but their chief function is the pro- 
duction of heat. 

Energy value to the body 9 calories per gram, 

or 4082 calories per pound. Fats have more than 
twice the energy value of protein or carbohydrate. 
Butter, egg-fat and cod liver oil are especially valu- 
able fats for growth because of certain elements 
which they contain. The amount of fat required 
depends upon, condition of system, amount and 
kind of w^ork done, age, climatic condition and 
amount of carbohydrate used. 

Amount Required 

The good housekeeper regulates the amount of 
wood or coal to suit the climatic conditions. She 
w^ould be considered a very unw^ise manager if she 
used wood and coal enough to keep her stove red 
hot in the summer time. This would be a waste of 
both fuel and stove. The housekeeper makes a 
much more serious mistake w^hen she provides just 
as much fuel food in summer as in winter. This 
practice results in waste of food and injury to the 
body. 

The foods classed under the head of fats are 
most easily digested when uncooked; for example, 
cream, butter, olive oil, and egg yolk. For this 
reason, these particular fats are advised for the 
person w^hose system has become weakened by ill- 
ness or overwork. These fats are readily digested 
and give heat very readily. 

Well cooked bacon is also a very easily digested 
fat. 



TALKS ON FOODS— THE RELATIVE VALUE OF FOODS 



53 



Other foods that are important as heat producers 
are other forms of fat meat, nuts, and eggs. Baked 
beans with pork provide a kind of food which is 
most wisely used in cold weather by active, strong 
adults. 

The second class of fuel foods, given in the out- 
line, is carbohydrates. They occur in starch, sugar, 
and celluloses. 

Proteins also furnish fuel, but their chief func- 
tion is tissue building. It would be unwise to 
supply the fuel needs of the body with proteins be- 
cause of the expense and the greater tax on the 
system. 

The principal starchy foods are the cereals; 
rice, corn, wheat, oats, barley, rye. Peas, beans, 
and potatoes also supply starch. In the chart fol- 
lowing it may be seen that the potato contains less 
starch than is ordinarily considered since about 
three-fourths of the potato is water. 

The other vegetables that are of special value as 
fuel foods are sweet potatoes, parsnips, beets, car- 
rots, and squash. 

Some fruits may properly enter into this list be- 
cause of the high per cent, of starch and sugars 
they contain. Fruits containing sugars are prunes, 
dates, figs, raisins, apricots. Bananas contain 
starch and sugars. 

Over-Ute of Carbohydrates 

If too much sugar and starch are eaten, fer- 
mentation may take place and interfere with diges- 
tion. Too much sugar and starch overworks the 
liver. 

Because sweet foods have the quality of satisfying 
the appetite very readily, they should not be taken 
to satisfy hunger but should rather be eaten after 
sufficient body building and body regulating foods 
have been taken to meet the body's need for such 
foods. The custom of serving the sweet food at 
the last of the meal is in harmony with this dietetic 
principle. 

It is important that children should form sane 
habits of eating sweet foods. The practice of using 
large amounts of sugar on cereals, cooked fruits 
and in beverages should be discouraged. 

The over-use of sugar irritates the lining of the 
digestive tract. This is caused by the abstraction 
of water from the mucuous lining. Sugar is one- 
sided in its value, consequently it is much wiser to 
obtain a high per cent, of heat from foods which 
serve other purposes as well. 

VALUE OF FRUIT AND VEGETABLES 

Vegetables contain protein, starch, sugar, cellu- 
lose, mineral matter, water and undetermined 
substances. 

Fruits contain (chiefly) sugar, cellulose, mineral 
matter, and water. 

Water removes wastes, lubricates tissues, aids in 
forming secretions, helps to equalize the tempera- 
ture. 



Acids help to maintain the alkalinity of the blood 
— stimulate the appetite. 

Mineral Salts. 

Build bone. 

Help to make blood alkaline. 

Aid in digestion. 

Aid in excretion. 

Build red blood cells. 

Build nerve tissue. 

Build cells. 

Cellulose exercises muscular lining of digestive 
tract. 

Note: Good authority makes the statement that 
the housekeeper is wise who pays as much for 
milk, vegetables, and fruit as for meat, eggs, and 
fish.

aid in 


regulation of body 



gard to choice of foods to suit the needs of the 
family. For example, if the family includes a child 
of 4 years, an active boy of 1 2, an office girl of 20, 
the father, who is an active outdoor worker, and 
an aged person of 90, these different members of 
the family require different kinds of food. 

Suggestions given indicate that the child of 4 
and the person of 90 require more nearly the same 
kind and amount of food than any other two 
members of the family. They require simply 
digested food in small amounts. Both will thrive 
better if they have 5 very simple meals a day 
rather than 3 heavy ones. Five simple meals a 
day means a very light breakfast of perhaps some 
fruit and ^veil-cooked cereal. The second meal 
at 1 o'clock may consist of a glass of milk with a 
little bread. The third meal at noon may be an 
egg, a baked potato, and apple sauce. The fourth 
meal at 3 o'clock may be something equivalent to 
the meal at 1 o'clock, and the fifth meal at 6 
o'clock may be some bread and butter and a baked 
apple vtrith a glass of milk. 

If this family includes a semi-invalid, the prob- 
lem will be made much more complicated. One 
wrho is weak bodily because of disease or over- 
work should take easily digested foods in moderate 
amount. Foods suitable for a person in that con- 
dition are also suitable for a child from 3 to 6 
years. Such foods include milk, cream, butter, 
eggs, thoroughly baked bread, well cooked vege- 
tables and cereals, fruit, crisp bacon, with choco- 
late or coca as a beverage occasionally. From this 
list, a variety of menus can be worked out. If 
these foods are particularly good for a young child, 
and a semi-invalid, it must follow that the more 
closely this list is followed for the active adult, the 
more wisely the digestive system is treated. 

Simple, well cooked foods are the most import- 
ant. Serve a few dishes at one meal and make 
the meals as varied as possible. In general cost of 
food, age, occupation, climatic conditions and ab- 
normal conditions are the points which must be 
considered in order that the family may be fed as 
Vi^isely as it is possible for it to be fed. 

Endeavor to distribute the protein, fat, and car- 
bohydrate through the day so that no meal will 
have a striking preponderance of one kind of food- 
stuff. 

For example, meat served with macaroni and 
cheese concentrates the protein in one meal, pota- 
toes with rice concentrate the starch, and fried 
potatoes and pie concentrate the fat. 

With the exception of a few such staples as 
bread, butter, and milk, try to avoid serving any 
food in the same form twice in the same day. 

Try to avoid serving any food which gives char- 
acter to a dish twice in the same meal, even in 
different forms. Do not, for instance, select tomato 
soup and tomato salad for the same meal.

HOW TO SELECT FOOD 
GENERAL SUGGESTIONS 

From "What the Body Needs." 
Farmers' Bulletin No. 808. U. S. Department of Agriculture. 

It is believed that it is impossible to plan the meals for a family wisely 
without at least as much knowledge of how different kinds of food serve the 
body as the above bulletin gives and that the safest short cut to good planning lies 
in considering foods in the five groups therein described. Ways of making econ- 
omical use of the materials in each group cannot be here discussed, but a few gen- 
eral suggestions for getting the most for one's money in the matter of food may 
be given. 

Use cereals (flour, meal, cereal breakfast foods, etc.) freely, taking pains to prepare 
them with great care and to vary the kind used from day to day if necessary to keep people 
from tiring of them. 

Remember that a quart of whole milk a day for each child, to be used as a beverage 
and in cookery, is not too much. 

Remember that while skim milk should never be substituted for whole milk as the 
principal food in a child's diet, it is as valuable as whole milk as a source of protein and 
mineral matters in the general diet. 

Remember that except in the case of milk for children, the amount needed of foods 
specially useful for body-building purposes — that is, meat and meat substitutes, fruits and 
vegetables — is not large, but what is needed is needed very much. 

Do not be ashamed to plan closely. Thrift in food means providing enough food, 
neither too little nor too much. 

Notice carefully how much of such staples as flour, sugar, milk, cooking fat, etc., is 
used each week for a month, and see if there are any ways of cutting down the quantity con- 
sumed. 

Buy non-perishable materials in quantity if better prices can be secured and there is 
a good storage place in the house. Neighbors can sometimes club together to get lower 
prices. 

Try to make the dishes served of such size that there will be enough to satisfy the 
appetite of the family and no unnecessary table and plate waste. 

Do not be above noticing whether anything usable is thrown away with the garbage, 
which always shows how thriftily food is used in the home. 

Many inexpensive materials can be made attractive, and the diet can be pleasantly 
varied by the use of different flavorings. 

"Finicky " tastes in food often prevent the use of many valuable materials which 
might be the means of saving money. 

Good food habits are an important part of personal hygiene and thrift. Children 
get such habits by having suitable amounts of suitable foods served to them and then being 
expected to eat what is set before them. 

True economy lies not alone in buying wisely but also in making the fullest possible 
use of what is bought.

FRESH FRUITS AND VEGETABLES 

CONSERVERS OF OTHER STAPLE FOODS 

(Extracts from Farmers' Bulletin 871, U. S. Department of Agriculture) 

Under the present unusual conditions, when it is desirable to save staple 
foods, and to reduce the amount of labor expended in transporting foods, special 
attention should be given to the possibility of using perishable food materials, par- 
ticularly vegetables and fruits, near the place of their production. The use of 
these foods can be increased without lessening the food value or attractiveness of 
the diet or seriously altering food habits. 

In general peas, beans and similar legumes w^ould be the most useful as 
protein (meat) savers; potatoes, sw^eet potatoes and similar vegetables as starch 
savers; and fruits and sweet potatoes as possible sugar savers, while all fruits and 
green and succulent vegetables are valuable to supply the diet w^ith mineral sub- 
stances, and with certain substances essential to health w^hich are present in them 
and in many other foods in minute amounts. When vegetables are used to supply 
protein, it is important to supplement them w^ith other food containing protein, 
and for this purpose milk, and particularly skim milk (so often a by-product, and a 
perishable one as w^ell) is important. 

USES OF FRESH FRUITS AND VEGETABLES IN THE ORDINARY DIET 

Under ordinary conditions, 1 to 1 '/4 pounds of fresh fruits and vegetables (the 
equivalent of an apple or an orange, two medium-sized potatoes and an average sized help- 
ing of some other vegetable) is probably all that even a grown person really needs in the 
course of a day. He may desire more because of their fine flavor or refreshing character, 
but the necessary health-promoting substances would probably be obtained from the amount 
mentioned. These supply less than a tenth of all the fuel and the protein needed, but a rela- 
tively large part of the iron, calcium and phosphorus. 

USES OF FRESH FRUITS AND VEGETABLES IN EMERGENCY DIET 

In an emergency, when fresh fruits and vegetables are relatively abundant they may 
with advantage be used partly to replace cereals and sugar, and to a less extent meat. Under 
such circumstances it is the part of wisdom to examine the list of fruits and vegetables and 
\o see which can be used in a way so as to save cereals or sugar, and w^hich used in such a 
way as to save meat. 

Fresh fruits and vegetables can be used in large quantities with little danger, provid- 
ing they are carefully cleaned and handled. It is even safe to say that there is absolutely no 
danger from the fruits and vegetables themselves, the only real difficulty lying in the fact that 
being bulky they quickly satisfy the appetite and sometimes lead people to believe they are 
supplied and to leave out of their diet the more substantial foods — meats, cereals, etc. — ^which 
are needed either for fuel or for body-building purposes. This fact should always be kept 
in mind in finding uses for these bulky foods.

TALKS ON FOODS— FRESH FRUITS AND VEGETABLES 39 

CLASSIFICATION OF STAPLE FOOD SAVERS 

Meat Savers — Shelled green peas, shelled green beans (Lima, kidney, etc.), 
shelled green cowpeas (common in the South) shelled green soy beans (common 
in the South). 

Cereal Savers — Potatoes, sweet potatoes, partially ripe bananas (cooked). 

Sugar Savers — Sweet potatoes, all fruits. 

USING SHELLED GREEN BEANS AND PEAS TO SAVE MEAT 

Beans and peas contain more protein than other fresh vegetables. This, however, is 
not the same as the proteins of meat, milk or egg, and should not be used to the exclusion of 
the others. When, however, beans and peas are freely used, less meat, milk and eggs are 
needed. For these reasons these vegetables are here called, not meat substitutes but meat 
savers. The following foods or combinations of foods, supply as much protein as one-fourth 
pound of beef of average composition: 

Eight or nine ounces of shelled green peas or beans. A large dish of green peas may 
be used in place of meat for dinner occasionally. Many persons like peas cooked with mint 
or served with mint sauce. 

One egg and 4 or 5 ounces of shelled green peas or beans. An omelet with peas 
( I egg and 1 cup peas per person) or a baked pea or bean souffle may be used as a meat 
substitute. 

One cup skim milk and 4 ounces shelled green peas or beans. A Lima bean chow- 
der made with skim milk is a good lunch or supper dish. 

USING POTATOES TO SAVE CEREALS 

A small potato (3 to 4 ounces) supplies as much starch as a large slice of bread 
( 1 ounce) but rather less protein. Potatoes eaten abundantly make it possible to get along 
with less bread. Potatoes can be substituted for about one-fourth of the wheat flour used in 
making ordinary bread and rolls. Recipes are given in the BREAD Section of this book; also 
in Farmers' Bulletin 807, Department of Agriculture. These call, however, for old rather 
than new potatoes. Mashed potatoes may be used in place of biscuit crust in making meat 
pies. Mashed potato sliced and fried may be used in place of bread and butter and makes 
a good breakfast dish. A very large variety of attractive salads may be made by combining 
potatoes with other vegetables — peas, beans, beets, cucumbers, radishes, onions, etc. Cot- 
tage cheese and potato salad go well together. This cheese has always been made in small 
quantities in the home, and now the Department of Agriculture is recommending to dairy- 
men that they make it as a means of utilizing their large quantities of skim milk. This should 
make cottage cheese a more common article of trade than it has been in the past. 

Sweet potatoes can be used in the same way as white potatoes. Bananas baked or 
fried supply considerable starch, though the amount cannot be exactly stated, because as the 
fruit ripens the starch changes to sugar. Green bananas peeled and boiled can be used like 
mashed potatoes, or may be sliced raw and fried. 

USING FRUITS TO SAVE SUGAR 

All ripe fruits contain sugar. The amount varies from about 3 ounces to one-fifth 
cup per pound in fresh figs and plums to about one-half ounce per pound in watermelon. 

If the water is driven off from fruits, as in the drying process, the sugar becomes far 
more prominent than it is in fresh fruits. Dried fruits therefore taste far sweeter than fresh 
ones and are for this reason often classed among the sweets. It should be remembered, how- 



60 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Section IV.— Part 1— TALKS ON FOODS 

ever, that sugar is present in all fresh fruits, even in the most acid ones, and that those per- 
sons who wish to do so can combine or economize on other kinds of sugar by eating large 
amounts of fresh fruits in unsweetened forms. 

In warm weather melons and other fruits may be used in place of "made" desserts, 
which usually contain both butter and sugar. Fruit and ice-cold junket, which can be pre- 
pared from skim-milk, make a refreshing dessert and utilize perishable foods chiefly. Or the 
dessert course may be omitted entirely and a fruit salad with cottage cheese may be used in 
its place. 

CONCLUSION 

When fresh fruits and vegetables are abundant and cheap they can be used in large 
enough amounts to effect an important saving of staple foods. If used intelligently, there is 
no danger that the diet will lack fuel or protein. Fresh legumes may be used to a certain 
extent in place of meat, potatoes in place of bread, and fruit in place of sugar. In connection 
with these foods, however, it is safe and highly desirable to use skim milk and its products, 
which like fresh fruits and vegetables are perishable and can be profitably used near the 
place of production. 



MILK: A CHEAP FOOD 

From Lesson III., Food Series, Cornell Reading Course for the Farm Home (Ejctracts) 
College of Agriculture, Ithaca, N. Y. 

Milk is a cheap food. Furthermore, in any family dietary where the welfare 
of children as well as of adults is intelligently considered, it is almost a necessity. 

The proof that milk, is a cheap food is not in the price paid for the quart. 
Even at fifteen or twenty cents a quart milk is a cheap source of certain nutritive 
substances always needed by the body, and particularly needed during the growth 
period. 

The increasing cost of many common foods leads to a temptation to reduce 
expenses by excluding those foods the prices of which seem prohibitive. It is an 
altogether unsafe practice, because the food thus eliminated may be, in spite of its 
seeming high cost, the cheapest possible source of some nutritive substance neces- 
sary to the health and welfare of the body. 

A study of the value of milk as a food and the particular part it should play 
in the dietary will serve as an illustration of the method that should be followed in 
determining the right of any food to a place in the daily meals. 



IS MILK A CHEAP SOURCE OF ENERGY? 

The energy that a food may yield is measured in terms of the Calorie. The greater 
number of Calories a digestible food will furnish for a given amount of money, the cheaper 
the food as a source of energy. 

if ten cents be spent and the particular need to be considered is that of energy, the 
problem is how to invest the ten cents in order to buy the most energy. 

Even figures showing energy values, however, must not influence one too much in 
estimating the cost of milk as an energy food, since two of the main sources of energy in 
milk, milk-fat and milk-sugar, besides their ability to yield energy, seem to have further sig- 
nificance in the dietary. Milk-sugar is believed to be of importance in holding in check putre- 
factive changes in the contents of the large intestine. This is particularly important in the 
case of the infant or young child who may be very susceptible to the injurious action of 
abnormal substances produced in the food canal. The fat of milk contains an unknow^n sub- 
stance essential for growth, and occurring in but few foods in amounts sufficient to promote 
normal growth. In considering the cost of milk as a source of energy, therefore, it is not 
entirely fair to forget these characteristics of two of its energy-yielding substances, since they 
play so important a part in human welfare, and particularly in the welfare of growing children. 



THE PROTEIN IN MILK 

The criticism sometimes indulged in of the cost of protein in milk, based entirely on 
comparative tables of protein contents only, would be convincing if it were not for the cer- 
tain facts recently made clear about protein. Protein is a name given to a group of sub- 
stances differing rather widely in their value to the body. Two foods may contain the same 
amount of protein; but an ounce of the protein from the first food may be much more valu- 
able in building and repairing tissue than an ounce of the protein from the second food. 



62 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Section IV.— Part I— TALKS ON FOODS 

Milk is a decidedly superior source of protein for general human consumption and is a par- 
ticularly good source where growth is taking place; the amount of protein required in the 
daily dietary may be less if milk forms a considerable part of the diet than if such foods as 
cereals are mainly depended on; milk is not an expensive source of protein. 

MILK AS A SOURCE OF UME 

Milk as a protein-yielding food can be replaced in the dietary more easily than milk 
as a lime-yielding food. Comparatively few common foods contain, in the amounts that can 
be eaten and digested by a child, a sufficient quantity of lime to provide for normal growth 
and health. 

Milk is the richest in available lime of all the common foods, and its absence in the 
family dietary or its use in very limited quantities may prove to be an expensive procedure 
as well as an unsafe one. The abundance of lime in milk makes it at eight cents a quart the 
cheapest possible source of lime, and at even fifteen or twenty cents a quart a very cheap 
source of lime. 

When therefore in a family having growing children the statement is made that the 
increasing cost of milk must cause a reduction in the amount of milk used, the housekeeper 
should be urged to consider the lime needs of the children before she seeks to reduce expenses 
in this way. 

Of course if all members of the family are adults, a lessened amount of milk may not 
be serious, but even here thought must be given to provide lime in other foods in order that 
adult welfare may not be impaired. 

MILK AS A SOURCE OF PHOSPHORUS AND IRON 

Milk is comparatively rich in phosphorus as well as in lime, and forms an important 
and cheap source of this valuable element. Milk is low in iron, and when it forms any con- 
siderable part of the diet it should be associated with foods rich in iron. In spite of its low 
iron content, it is an important food to use when the blood is low in iron, because lime in food 
is believed to increase the ability of the body to utilize iron. The question is frequently raised: 
Why, if milk is low in iron, does a baby thrive on it so well as the only source of nutriment? 
The answer is found in the fact that at birth the healthy baby has a stored surplus of iron in 
its body, which normally will last it through a period of nine to twelve months of maternal 
nursing. 

IS MILK A CHEAP SOURCE OF BODY-REGULATING SUBSTANCES? 

The term body-regulating substances is used to cover all the nutrients that play a part 
in keeping the machinery of the body in working order. The beating of the heart, the circu- 
lation of the blood, the ability to grow and reproduce, the ability to digest and absorb food, 
may all be classed as body processes regulated by certain substances furnished by food. 
All nutrients contained in food undoubtedly have some part to play as body-regulating sub- 
stances. Protein, phosphorus, iron and lime not only serve as conspicuous materials for build- 
ing the body, but play a second part in regulating its activities. Salts, acids, flavors, are all 
concerned in regulating body processes. 

THE SO-CALLED VITAMINES IN MILK ESSENTL\L TO GROWTH 

In the past two years some results of deepest importance to human welfare have been 
accomplished show^ing that besides all the nutrient substances that are now familiar, such as 
protein, fat, starch, lime, acids, salts and flavors, there are other dietary factors essential to 



TALKS ON FOODS— MILK: A CHEAP FOOD 63 

health and growth. Very Httle is known as yet about these factors that some foods seem to 
contain and others seem to lack, except that when the foods containing them are 
absent from the dietary, the young animal ceases to grow and the adult animal 
suffers in health. One serious disease of nutrition, beriberi, so common in some Eastern rice- 
producing countries, has been traced to the too exclusive use of polished rice, which lacks 
these dietary factors. Other nutritive diseases somewhat like beriberi, and occurring in this 
country, may be proved to be similarly caused. 

A popular name, vitamines, has been given to these essential dietary factors, and is 
referred to now because many persons may have heard it used. The name vitamine is, how- 
ever not accepted as either good or descriptive by many of the persons doing the most work 
on this subject, and consequently is only mentioned in passing. 

There seem to be two of these factors essential to right nutrition. One of them 
occurs dissolved in the fat of certain foods; the other one can be obtained from certain 
foods dissolved in water. They are designated for convenience "fat-soluble A" and "water- 
soluble B." 

THE FAT-SOLUBLE GROWTH-PROMOTING FACTOR IN MILK 

The fat-soluble factor that promotes growth and is essential to it, does not occur in 
all fats. This necessarily points to decided differences in the value of certain sources of fat. 
Milk-fat as it occurs in milk and butter and probably cheese, the fat in egg-yolk, cod-liver oil, 
and to a considerably lesser extent muscle and kidney fat, contain the needed factor. Forage 
foods, such as alfalfa and cabbage leaves, seem to contain it in abundance. It seems to be 
absent or deficient in lard and all vegetable oils. 

When this knowledge is summed up into usable form, it results in this statement: 
That since the human being has a limited capacity for forage foods, such as alfalfa and cab- 
bage, since he must have this essential factor in his diet to some extent in adult life and to a 
much larger extent in childhood, and since it is absent or deficient in the grains that he uses 
as food, he must depend primarily on milk, eggs and meat for his supply. Further, since 
meat contains a smaller amount of this factor than milk or eggs, the two foods last men- 
tioned take first rank as its sources. For the reason that meat contains this factor in lesser 
quantity than does milk-fat, oleomargarine, although having the same energy value as butter, 
is less valuable than butter as a source of the fat-soluble A. 



THE WATER-SOLUBLE GROWTH-PROMOTING FACTOR IN MILK 

The second factor essential to growth, the water-soluble factor, is also absent from 
certain foods; and in its absence not only is growth prevented, but as in the case of the too 
exclusive diet of polished rice in India, serious illness results. 

This water-soluble, growth-promoting factor, like the fat-soluble one, is present in 
amounts sufficient for growth in milk and eggs. It occurs in considerable amounts in the 
embryo of the cereal grains, but is absent in the grain from which the germ has been 
removed. 

When white bread, polished rice, or degerminated cereals form an important part of 
the diet, as they frequently do, some food must be added that contains the water-soluble, 
growth-promoting factor. Bread and milk make an excellent combination in this respect. 

SUMMARY 

With all the evidence in, no food bears the investigation of nutritive properties better 
than does milk. It is impossible to escape the conviction that not only is it a cheap food. 



64 



THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Section IV.— Part 1— TALKS ON FOODS 



but it is a food whose value can hardly be estimated in terms of dollars and cents. It has 
been pointed out that: 

1 . Although milk is not the cheapest source of energy that can be bought, it is 
nevertheless an important source of energy, and the energy-yielding substances, the protein, 
the milk-sugar and the milk-fat, all have special value. 

2. Milk is a cheap source of protein because the protein that it contains is of a 
kind particularly valuable for building tissue. 

3. Ordinarily milk is the cheapest and most valuable source of lime, unless it is 
discovered that lime in water can take the place of lime in milk. 

4. Milk is a valuable and cheap source of phosphorus. 

5. Milk is deficient in iron, but the iron that it contains is particularly well utilized 
by the body. 

6. Milk is the most important of the three foods, milk, eggs and meat, which are 
the chief sources of a factor in foods that is soluble in fat, that is essential to growth and 
health, and that is called "fat-soluble A." 

7. Milk is one of the most important sources of a factor in foods that is soluble 
in water, is essential to growth and health, and is called "water-soluble B."

TO PASTEURIZE MILK 



Set the bottles of milk in a pail v^ith a perforated false bottom. An inverted 
perforated pie tin wrill do. Insert a thermometer in one of the bottles, by punch- 
ing a hole in the cap or through the cotton plug. Fill the pail with water nearly to 
the level of the milk. Heat the water sligthly until the thermometer registers 
150° F. Change the thermometer from the milk to the water, add cold water till 
the temperature of the water is also 1 50° F. Cover the kettle, keeping it as nearly 
this temperature as possible for 30 minutes; then cool, by running water into the 
pail . Remove the bottles and put them immediately on ice. 

If no thermometer is at hand, the following method may be followed: Put 
a gallon (4 quarts) of water on the stove in a kettle with a perforated false bottom. 
When the water is boiling hard, remove the kettle from the stove to a table and 
allow it to stand uncovered for 1 minutes ; then put the filled and loosely corked 
bottles into the water, cover the kettle, and allow it to stand covered for half an 
hour. At the end of this time remove the bottles, cool rapidly under running 
water, and put in the ice box until needed. Do not uncork the bottle from the time 
it is first closed until the baby is to be fed. 



SUGAR: A VALUABLE FOOD 

(From Iowa State College of Agriculture Bulletin "Sugar") 

Sugar in its various forms constitutes one of the important food materials 
of the world. With the development of the sugar industry and the consequent 
cheapening of the product the consumption of sugar has increased at a very rapid 
rate. 

Manufacture 

The great bulk of the sugar used for household purposes is prepared by 
expressing the juice from crushed sugar canes or sliced beets, filtering the liquid, 
boiling it in a vacuum and clarifying by means of lime, acid calcium phosphate and 
bone-black. 

Molasses is a product obtained in the process of refining sugar. 

Brown sugars are not completely refined. 

Granulated, loaf and pulverized sugars are the various forms in which 
refined sugar is prepared. 

COMPARATIVE VALUE OF CANE AND BEET SUGARS 

There is no difference in the nutritive value or purity of the different forms of sugar 
made from beets and sugar cane if they have undergone the same degree of refining. Cane 
and beet sugar are identical in composition, in sweetening power, in chemical reactions and 
in dietetic value. 

Failures in jelly making and candy making sometimes attributed to the use of beet 
sugar may usually be traced to other causes. 

SUGAR AS A FOOD 

Sugars are among the most valuable of the carbohydrate foods. Unlike the other 
fuel foods (starches and fats) they yield energy very readily. Some of the simple sugars 
such as glucose and fructose from honey and the fruits, are ready for body use as soon as 
dissolved. These pass into the blood stream by absorption through the walls of the intes- 
tine and become available for body needs at once. 

The more complex sugars, sucrose, lactose and maltose, are acted upon by digestive 
ferments which change them to glucose and fructose, thereby preparing them for absorption. 
All of the sugars, and the starches as well, must be in the form of glucose or other kindred 
sugars before the body can convert them into energy. It wil be seen, therefore, that pure 
glucose is a wholesome and easily assimilated food. 

Honey consists largely of fructose and has a mildly laxative effect, hence, is a good 
substitute for some of the sucrose in the diet. 

Lactose (milk sugar) is only slightly sweet in taste and does not ferment so readily 
as other sugars. For these reasons it is used extensively in the preparation of foods for in- 
fants and invalids. 

65 



66 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Section IV.— Part 1— TALKS ON FOODS 

MODERATION IN THE USE OF SUGAR 

The increasing per capita consumption of sugar in the United States should serve as 
a warning against the dangers of a one-sided diet. 

Because sweet foods have the quality of satisfying the appetite very readily, they 
should not be taken to satisfy hunger but should rather be eaten after sufficient body-build- 
ing and body- regulating foods have been taken to meet the body's need for such foods. The 
custom of serving the sweet food at the last of the meal is in harmony with this dietetic prin- 
ciple. 

It is important that children should form sane habits of eating sweet foods. The 
practice of using large amounts of sugar on cereals, cooked fruits and in beverages should be 
discouraged. The cereal foods are more wholesome and better balanced when served with 
milk, cream or a little butter. Candy is more wisely allowed only at the close of a meal. 

Such fruits as dates, raisins and figs, which furnish the easily digested fruit sugar, 
are a better confection for children than the candies which consist chiefly of the less easily 
digested sucrose. These fruits furnish mineral matter in addition to sugar. 

Concentrated sweet foods are less apt to cause irritation and fermentation in the 
digestive tract if taken with large amounts of water. 

Menus rich in sugar should ndt include large amounts of fat and starch. Menus rich 
in starch and fat should not include large amounts of sugar. 



SUGAR AND ITS VALUE AS FOOD 

(From U. S. Farmers' Bulletin 535) 

MILK SUGAR 

Milk contains from 4 to 5 per cent, of an important sugar — milk sugar or 
lactose. When separated or purified it is a crystalline product and is sold in that 
form. It is said to be the most readily digestible sugar and is often found in pre- 
pared foods, especially those made for invalids and children. It is much less 
sweet than cane sugar. 

HONEY 

Before sugar was a common commercial product, honey, stored by the honey bee, 
was very generally used to sweeten foods. Although its use for this purpose is much less 
common since cane sugar has become so plentiful and cheap, honey is still highly prized as a 
wholesome sweet food and is used either alone or with other foods in a great many ways. 
Its flavor is due to volatile bodies in the flowers from which it is obtained, some flowers 
imparting a more agreeable flavor than others to the honey. Its behavior in cooking and 
storing is different from that of the ordinary sugars for reasons not yet thoroughly under- 
stood. Honey has been used as a food from the earliest times, and is generally conceded 
to be ■wholesome as w^ell as palatable. Prior to the passage of the Federal Pure Food Law, 
in 1906, strained honey was very frequently adulterated with commercial glucose and other 
materials, such as commercial invert sugar, but since this law went into effect there is little 
adulteration of this product. Mixtures with glucose and invert sugar are sold, but the law 
requires that they be so labeled. 

SWEET MATERIALS OTHER THAN SUGAR 

Saccharin, an extremely sweet material, is not a sugar, but is of an entirely different 
chemical structure, being a benzene compound. Its use in food products was forbidden 
under the Federal Pure Food Law. It is quite commonly prescribed in cases of diabetes to 
satisfy the craving for sweets, as it is believed to be less harmful in such cases than the 
sugar, the flavor of which it replaces. 

There are other chemical substances which are not sugars, but which have a marked 
sweet flavor. They, like saccharin, are in no sense foodstuffs. 

GLUCOSE AND OTHER PRODUCTS MADE FROM STARCH 

"Commercial glucose," "40 sugar," "80 sugar," and "commercial dextrose" are 
commercial products of the hydrolysis of starch. TTie first is a thick liquid, rarely showing 
crystallization. 

Commercial glucose is often used as a substitute for sugar in syrups, candy making, 
preserving, etc. Confectioners maintain that certain kinds of candy cannot be made of as 
good consistency with pure cane sugar as with the addition of some glucose. In such cases 
it can hardly be considered an adulterant. When it is used as a cheaper substitute for cane 
sugar, and the goods are sold as cane-sugar products, its use is evidently fraudulent. The 
present law in the United States requires that syrups, jams, jellies, etc., made with glucose 
shall be so labeled. Its nutritive value is practically the same as that of other carbohydrates, 
aiid there is no reason to suppose that when properly made it is not wholesome.

PURITY OF SUGAR 

Of 500 samples of sugar examined several years ago by the Bureau of Chemistry 
of this department, not one was found to be adulterated. The low price of cane sugar, in 
comparison with the price of substances that might be used for adulteration, protects it from 
such attempts. 

A more recent publication of the Bureau of Chemistry states that sugars as a class, 
both the high and low grades as now found on the market, are practically free from adulter- 
ation. This is particularly true since the Federal Pure Food Law of 1906 went into effect. 

There is a popular belief that granulated sugar is often adulterated w^ith white sand 
or finely ground rock, and that pulverized sugar is commonly adulterated with starch or lime 
dust. Cases of such adulteration, however, have rarely been found by the Bureau of Chem- 
istry, though starch has been detected in a very few samples of powdered sugar. It is a very 
simple matter to test suspicious sugar for the presence of such materials. Sugar is readily 
soluble in water, and the sand and mineral adulterants are insoluble. 

FOOD VALUE OF SUGAR 

The most interesting use of sugar is as a food for the animal body. Within certain 
limits, sugar may be considered as the equivalent of starch that has been digested and made 
ready for absorption. A mealy boiled potato like all forms of starchy food, must be largely 
converted into some kind of sugar by the digestive juices before it can be absorbed as food. 

DIGESTION OF SUGAR 

When sugar is eaten it is changed in the digestive tract before it is taken up in the 
blood and carried where it is needed. If a solution of cane sugar be injected directly into 
the blood, it is passed out by the kidneys unchanged, showing that it is not fitted for assimi- 
lation until it has been changed, as it is in normal digestion. 

SUGAR AS A FOOD FOR MUSCULAR WORK 

Food must supply enough protein or nitrogenous material for the formation and 
repair of tissues and for certain other uses in the body. 

According to our present knowledge the value of sugar as a food for muscular work 
may be briefly summarized as follows: 

When the organism is adapted to the digestion of starch, and there is sufficient time 
for its utilization, sugar has no advantage over starch as a food for muscular work. 

In small quantities and in not too concentrated form sugar will take the place, prac- 
tically w^eight for weight, of starch as a food for muscular work, barring the difference in 
energy and in time required to digest them, sugar having the advantage in these respects. 

It furnishes the needed carbohydrate material to organisms that have little or no 
power to digest starch. Thus, milk sugar is part of the natural food of the infant whose 
digestive organs are, as yet, unable to convert starch into an assimilable form. 

In times of great exertion or exhausting labor, the rapidity with which it is assimi- 
lated gives sugar certain advantages over starch and makes it prevent fatigue. 

This latter quality, which renders it more rapidly available for muscular power, may 
account for the fact that sugar is so relished by people who are doing muscular work, and by 
those of very active habits, such as children. 



TALKS ON FOODS— SUGAR AND ITS VALUE AS FOOD 69 

The American farmer ranks high among agriculturists as a rapid and enduring worker, 
and his consumption of sweets is known to be very large. The same is true of lumbermen 
and others who work hard in the open air; sugar and sweet cakes are favorite foods with 
them. Dietary studies carried on in the winter lumber camps of Maine showed that large 
quantities of cookies, cakes, molasses, and sugar were eaten, sugar of all sorts supplying on 
an average 1 per cent of the total energy of the diet. 

The value of sugar in cold climates, where foods containing starch are not available, 
is evident, and in the outfit of polar expeditions sugar is now given an important place. 

SUGAR AS A FAT FORMER 

Sugar, like starch, is fattening; that is, when taken in excess it may be transformed 
into fat and stored as reserve material. On this account physicians commonly advise that 
sugar be sparingly used by the corpulent. This advice is given because sugar in the form of 
candy or other sweets is often taken as an accessory to an already abundant diet. 

SUGAR AS A FLAVOR 

in addition to its value as a food, sugar is important in the diet as a flavor, one 
which the cook could not easily spare, as it now enters into a great variety of dishes. In- 
deed its agreeable flavor has always constituted one of the chief reasons for its use, and will 
continue to do so, even though we make use of the abundance of relatively cheap starchy 
materials which we possess which theoretically may readily take the place of sugar as a food. 

In some dietary studies made under the auspices of this department with a club of 
students at the University of Maine, an investigation was made of the effect of supplying a 
liberal amount of maple syrup in a diet which contained an abundance of nutrients. The 
syrup was evidently relished, and considerable amounts were eaten. However, there was 
not a corresponding decrease in other foods; on the contrary, the amount of flour was in 
excess of the amount ordinarily consumed. It would seem that the maple syrup, and flour 
in the form of griddle cakes, were consumed simply on account of their agreeable flavor. 
Provided the deit contained sufficient nutrients in the first place, this increase was not desir- 
able on the ground of economy, and it may be questioned whether it was desirable from the 
standpoint of health. When a similar comparison was made of the addition to the diet of 
liberal quantities of milk, which has a much less distinctive flavor, there was a corresponding 
decrease in the amount of other foods consumed. This would indicate that much of the sugar 
used is consumed for its agreeable flavor and not because it is recognized as a food which is 
required to satisfy body needs. 

GENERAL CONCLUSIONS 

One may say in general that the wholesomeness of sweetened foods and their utiliza- 
tion by the system is largely a question of quantity and concentration. For instance, a simple 
pudding flavored with sugar rather than heavily sweetened is considered easy of digestion, 
but when more sugar is used, with the addition of eggs and fat, we have as the result highly 
concentrated forms of food, which can be eaten with advantage only in moderate quantities 
and which are entirely unsuited to children and invalids. 

It is true that the harvester, lumberman, and others who do hard work in the open 
air consume great amounts of food containing considerable quantities of sugar, such as pie 
and doughnuts, and apparently with impunity; but it is equally true that people living an 
indoor life find that undue amounts of pie, cake, and pudding, with highly sweetened pre- 
served fruit, and sugar in large amounts on cooked cereals, almost always bring indigestion 
sooner or later. 



70 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Section IV— Part 1— TALKS ON FOODS 

From a gastronomic point of view it would seem also that in the American cuisine 
sugar is used with too many kinds of food, with a consequent loss of variety and piquancy 
of flavor in the different dishes. The nutty flavor of grains and the natural taste of mild 
fruits are very often concealed by the addition of large quantities of sugar. 

In the diet of the undernourished larger amounts of sugar would doubtless help to 
supply adequate nutrition. This point is often urged by European hygienists. In the food 
of the well-to-do it is often the case, however, that starch is not diminished in proportion as 
sugar is added. That sugar, on account of its agreeable flavor, furnishes a temptation to 
take more carbohydrate food than the system needs cannot be denied. The vigor of diges- 
tion and muscular activity in each particular case would seem to suggest the limit. A lump 
of sugar represents about as much nutriment as an ounce of potato, but, while the potato will 
be eaten only because hunger prompts, the sugar, because of its taste, may be taken when 
the appetite has been fully satisfied. 

Sugar is a useful and valuable food. It must, however, be remembered that it is a 
concentrated food, and therefore should be eaten in moderate quantities. Further, like other 
concentrated foods, sugar seems best fitted for assimilation by the body when supplied with 
other materials which dilute it or give it the necessary bulk. 

Persons of active habits and good digestion will add sugar to their food almost at 
pleasure without inconvenience, while those of sedentary life, of delicate digestion, or with a 
tendency to corpulency would do better to use sugar very moderately. It is generally 
assumed that 4 or 5 ounces of sugar per day is as much as it is well for the average adult 
to eat under ordinary conditions. 



FATS AND THEIR ECONOMICAL USE IN THE HOME 

(From U. S. Farmer.' Bulletin 469) 

The fats in the ordinary diet fall naturally into two groups, those eaten be- 
cause they happen to be components of foods, like the fat in milk, meats, or fish, 
and those like butter, salad oils, or lard, which are added to other foods in cooking 
or serving. The housekeeper interested in the economical use of fats in the home 
must take into consideration fat as contributed by both groups. Obviously, the 
kind and quantity of the first group of fats eaten are determined by the foods 
making up the diet and this is governed largely by individual tastes and local or 
family food habits. As regards this group, economy involves chiefly the proper 
selection and combination of foods containing fat in abundance with other foods 
containing little of it, so as to secure a diet supplying the proper proportions of 
protein and carbohydrate as well as fat. 

The flavors and odors of fats are probably due to the presence in them of small 
amounts of difficultly removable substances rather than to specific properties of the pure fats 
themselves, in view' of the fact that flavors and odors become much less noticeable the more 
completely the fats are purified. The characteristic flavor of butter, for example, is due to 
the absorption by the fat of the substances formed in the fermentation of milk and cream by 
lactic acid and bacteria and to the presence of small particles of the curd. Similarly, the by- 
products, such as butyric acid, which are formed by the action of undesirable bacteria, may 
be absorbed by the fat and give rise to the undesirable flavor of butter of poor quality or 
that which has deteriorated. Musty flavors are doubtless due to the presence of the products 
of metabolism of molds which may be present in the fats. In the case of some fats, like 
those of beef and mutton, or the fish oils, it has apparently been impossible to remove entirely 
the flavor-giving substances by the ordinary methods of refining. 



THE PLACE OF FATS IN THE DIET 

The chief value of fats in nutrition is that they furnish energy which the body requires 
to perform its work. The ideal diet should contain sufficient quantities of fat and carbo- 
hydrates to insure it the required amount of energy, as well as a sufficient quantity of protein 
to supply the necessary nitrogen for growth and repair of the body, also mineral matter for 
growth and other body needs, and vitamins or similar bodies required to render the diet 
adequate for maintenance. Since fats furnish 2 '/^ times as much energy, pound for pound, 
as do proteins and carbohydrates, and since they are both wholesome and palatable, they 
are very commonly used to increase the energy value of the diet. Furthermore, they are 
especially useful as a source of energy where an excess of carbohydrates in the diet is to be 
avoided, as in cases of diabetes or certain forms of indigestion. 

While fats and carbohydrates may replace each other to a considerable extent, 
recent investigations indicate that some carbohydrate supplied by the food or formed in the 
body from protein is essential for the combustion of fats in the body. Experts in nutrition 
and dietetics, therefore, believe that neither one should be used to the exclusion of the other. 

The digestive disturbances often attributed to eating fat are probably due not so 
much to the inability of the body to digest the fat itself as to other factors, chief among 
which are bad cooking, overeating of foods containing fats, and rancidity. 



72 THE HOME-K EEPING BOOK— Section IV.— Part 1— TALKS ON FOODS 

Disagreeable sensations are experienced by some people after eating large quantities 
of foods such as meats containing much fat interspersed with the muscular tissue, and over- 
rich puddings or salads. This may be explained by the fact that the digestive juices of 
stomach have little solvent action on such nonemulsified fats and are thus hindered from 
digesting the protein which is covered by or very intimately mixed with the fat. The pass- 
ing of the food through the pylorus into the small intestine is thus delayed until the fat has 
become separated from the lean portions by the enzymic and mechanical action of the 
stomach. For this reason very fat meats, for instance, remain a longer time in the stomach 
than lean meats, although in the end they are as thoroughly digested. Similar digestive dis- 
turbances are sometimes experienced after eating fried foods (cooked without scorching) or 
foods in which fat is incorporated in such a manner that it prevents the digestive juices from 
acting upon the protein and carbohydrates. This delayed digestion is often mistaken for 
diminished or incomplete digestion. 

It must be remembered that there are some persons whose systems can tolerate little 
if any food rich in fats. This, like the inability of some to eat strawberries, onions, or other 
foods, without digestive disturbances, is a matter of individual peculiarity. 



OLEOMARGARINE 

A discussion of animal fats would not be complete without some mention of oleo- 
margarine, called "margarin" in Europe. The principal fats used in its manufacture in the 
United States are oleo oil, neutral lard (that is, a specially rendered lard), and cottonseed 
and other oils. All these ingredients must be pure and prepared with care in order that 
none of them shall have any marked taste or odor. These are mixed in such proportions as 
will give the final product a melting point very near that of butter. After being thoroughly 
mixed the fats are churned with a small quantity of milk and sometimes cream, the propor- 
tions of these used depending upon the quality of the product desired. In the preparation of 
high-grade oleomargarine varying quantities of butter are also added. The resulting prod- 
uct is then washed, salted, and worked as in ordinary butter-making processes. Owing to 
the ease with which a highly colored oleomargarine might be sold as butter, it is illegal to 
sell oleomargarine unless it is plainly labeled as such, and the practice of coloring it to 
imitate butter is discouraged by a heavy tax. Oleomargarine is not used as extensively in 
this country as in Europe, where it serves both for table and culinary purposes. If prepared 
from pure materials and under sanitary conditions, it is a wholesome fat, which, according 
to European investigators, is well assimilated. It has an energy value of about 3,500 calories 
per pound. 



OUVE OIL 

The best grade, known as virgin oil, is obtained from perfect olives of the proper 
degree of ripeness. Lower grades may be obtained either by crushing and pressing an in- 
ferior quality of olives or by a second pressing of the residue from the first pressing of the 
better grades of fruit. The only refining or purification of the better grades of oil necessary 
is filtration to remove foreign matter. In the United States olive oil is used almost exclus- 
ively for table purposes, being a very common salad oil. In localities where it is produced, 
especially in Southern Europe, it is used for cooking as well as for table purposes, owing 
to the larger and more readily available supply (especially of the cheaper grades) and to 
the relatively limited supply of animal fat in such regions. 



. TALKS ON FOODS— FAT AND THEIR ECONOMICAL USE 73 

COTTONSEED OIL 

Cottonseed oil in its crude form is obtained as a ruby or dark-red oil by subjecting 
the seeds of the cotton plant to great pressure. The refined oil was first utilized in the pre- 
paration of various lard substitutes by mixing with it hard animal fats to produce a substance 
having a consistency similar to lard. Other methods have been developed, and a wide 
variety of cooking fats prepared from cottonseed oil are now on the market. More recently 
salad oils have been prepared which are wholesome and palatable and are being used in 
increasing quantities for table purposes. 

NUT BUTTERS 

Closely related to the nut oils are the nut butters prepared by grinding finely the 
meats of peanuts, almonds, or other nuts rich in fat, so as to produce an oily mass much like 
butter in consistency. Peanut butter is by far the most common of the nut butters. It is 
used chiefly as a filling for sandwiches, crackers, etc., though it finds some use in cooking. 
The nut butters can be made at home by grinding the whole nuts; a special nut-butter knife 
being furnished with some of the meat or food choppers. In addition to containing a large 
amount of fat, nut butters also contain considerable protein. 

THE SELECTION OF EDIBLE FATS 

In the selection of edible fats the principle considerations should be the purpose 
for which the fat is to be used, quality, price, and individual preference, since the energy 
which the body derives from different fats is about the same, and all are regarded as 
wholesome when of good quality. Custom, which influences to a considerable extent the 
choice of all foods, can, therefore, be subordinated to the more essential consideration of 
economy. 

When purchasing fats for table use it should be remembered that they influence 
the wholesomeness of the foods with which they are served as w^ell as the energy value 
and cost. The price of table fats depends largely upon their flavor and to a less extent on 
color, and in selecting them each housekeeper must decide how much she can afford to pay 
for these properties, since all the edible fats have practically the same energy value. 
In general it pays always to buy fats of such good quality that none will have to be thrown 
away through spoilage. In some instances a higher-priced article may be more economical 
in the end as, for example, clean, sanitary butter, as compared to a cheaper but less sanitary 
product. In some instances, where taste or flavor only is involved, a less expensive table 
fat may answer quite satisfactorily the purpose of a more expensive one. For example, the 
chief use of table oils is as an ingredient of salad dressings, and when a characteristic 
flavor is not especially desired, good grades of cottonseed and peanut oils, having a bland 
flavor, may be used, when these are less expensive than the corresponding grades of olive 
oil. 

Fats used for shortening influence the appearance, flavor, texture, composition, 
keeping quality, and cost of the foods in which they are incorporated. In selecting short- 
ening fats flavor and odor are to be considered, but attractive appearance and color are of 
less importance, since in cooking these are usually masked. Other qualities being equal, 
those culinary fats are more economical and desirable which possess the best keeping qual- 
ity; that is, the least tendency to become rancid. Also, for general use shortening fats give 
the best results if they are neither too hard nor too soft to be easily mixed with the other in- 
gredients of the dough at ordinary temperatures. 

Fats used as a medium for cooking should be carefully selected, since they in- 
fluence the flavor, appearance, and texture of the foods cooked in them, as is evident when 
one recalls the bad flavor imparted to fried foods by burned or rancid fat. Preference 



74 THE H OME-KEEPING BOOK— Section IV.— Part 1— TALKS ON FOQDS 

should be given to a fat which does not scorch too readily at the temperature most commonly 
used for frying. Experiments in the laboratory of the Office of Home Economics indicate 
that butter and lard scorch at a lower temperature than beef or mutton fats and cottonseed, 
peanut or cocoanut oils. For this reason, therefore, the latter fats are preferable for deep 
frying, which requires high temperature. 

Prejudice often exerts an influence on the selection of fats as well as other food 
materials, and these prejudices are often curious. For example, some persons who think 
that lard is not only indigestible, but also unwholesome, nevertheless enjoy bacon, which, 
of course, supplies pork fat in a different form. Such prejudices have little or no basis of 
fact and should not exert too much influence on the selection of any food material. 

SUMMARY 

Economy of fats in the home may be secured by intelligent selection, economical 
use, and by the prevention of unnecessary waste. For intelligent selection, which means 
choosing the fat best suited for the purpose in question, a knowledge of the properties and 
prices of the different fats on the market is necessary. It should be remembered that the 
energy value of all the pure fats is practically the same, and the housekeeper must deter- 
mine how much she can afford to pay for particular flavors or appearance, on which the 
difference in price largely depends. To secure economy fats should be used primarily for 
the purposes to which they are best adapted, and the extravagant use of both table and 
cooking fats should be avoided. To prevent unnecessary waste fats should be carefully 
handled and stored so that none need be discarded through spoilage. Furthermore, all 
scraps of fat w^hich accumulate in the home should be saved and used for culinary pur- 
poses wherever possible, thus lessening the amount of money expended for cooking fats. 
It should always be borne in mind that while an economical use of fat is to be desired, 
stinting is to be avoided. In determining how far economy in the use of fats is to be prac- 
ticed one should bear in mind that true economy is possible only where the value of the 
time and energy involved in the saving or utilizing of an article is less than the value of 
the articles saved. 



COMMON SENSE IN MODERN COOKING 

It is no longer considered sufficient that a girl should learn cooking only 
after the manner her mother attained it from her grandmother. Much that her 
grandmother knew was of high practical value, and w^hile she did not know the 
scientific "why," yet in many cases we have never been able to improve on her 
"how." Her knowledge should properly pass on in the manner it does to the next 
generation. At the same time, the modern girl wants to know something of the 
simple chemistry of foods and the chemical changes that take place in cooking them. 

The health of the family may be undermined not only in the food factories 
that devitalize foods through various "refining" practices and in adulterations, but 
through faulty treatment in the kitchen of the best and freshest foods. 

One of the most serious and common mistakes to be avoided is the custom of 
"draining off" the water in which foods are cooked. Probably few do not commit this 
error. There aie numerous ways to avoid it — use less water, or boil until the surplus passes 
off in the form of steam, leaving the natural salts behind, otherwise the most valuable nutri- 
tive elements are thrown away. 

We know now that the mineral salts, although constituting a small percentage in the 
total bulk of foods in proportion to the protein, fats and carbohydrates, are nevertheless of 
most vital importance. These are the original salts of iron, phosphorus, lime, potassium and 
other minerals. They are indispensable in maintaining a healthy condition of the blood, 
and in the manufacture of the brain, the nerves, the bones, the glands and their secretions. 

It is because of the very fact that the normal proportion of the mineral salts in any 
foods is small that they should not be drained or wasted aw^ay in cooking, No artificial 
"seasoning" with salt and pepper, butter and other additions, can restore the lost value of 
the natural salts — and the need of these seasonings to restore "taste" miraculously disap- 
pears to a large extent when the natural salts are retained with the flavor and "life" which 
they in themselves yield the palate. 

There is reason for the popularity of baked potatoes. The mineral salts are in and 
next to the skin. In eating them the skin should be scraped very close — or itself eaten. 
Potatoes should never be peeled by paring off the skin; they are thus robbed of their 
highest value. If boiled and only the thinnest film of skin removed, this value is saved — 
providing they are boiled down until little or no water remains to be drained off, or pro- 
vided they are mashed into the residue of juice or water and served in that manner. 

Steam cooking is simple; almost anything can be steamed. An ordinary colander 
covered with a saucepan may be used. The double boiler enables one to cook vegetables 
in their own juices with the addition of little or no water and no draining off. 

Baking is perhaps the most ideal form of treatment for many foods besides meats. 
It retains all of the natural juices and minerals and serves them in their most assimilable 
chemical condition.

THE ALL-CONVENIENT CASSEROLE 

AND 

THE USE OF THE OVEN 

Under the head of Casserole come Marmites, Cocottes, Ramekins, au Gratin 
Dishes, and Souffle Cases. 

Almost everything can be cooked en casserole — meat, fish, vegetables, poul- 
try, fruit, cereals — anything requiring slow, gentle cooking. The flavor of re- 
cooked meats is far superior thus than if prepared in a saucepan, and the slow 
cooking does not harden or contribute to an "overdone" taste. 

Left-overs, small entrees, salads, serve most attractively en casserole or en 
rsunekin. 

The oven, for casserole cooking, should be kept about 1 1 2 degrees Fahren- 
heit, or less ; the food should simmer, not boil. 



ADVANTAGES OF CASSEROLE COOKING 

1 . The casseroles are clean, to start with. 

2. They are easy to keep clean, 

3. Their glaze is hard and acid-resisting. 

4. They are free from all injurious substances. 

5. They do not change flavor or affect color of food. 

6. They do not become flavored by food cooked in them. 

7. They cook gently, steadily and economically, both as regards shrinkage of food 
and consumption of fuel. 

8. They preserve all the goodness and the juice. 

9. They improve the appearance of food and intensify natural flavors. 

I 0. The casserole may be used either on top of the stove or in the oven. 

I 1 . The ingredients may be put into the casserole and allowed to stand in it for 
hours before cooking, without spoiling. 

12. Food may be served in the casserole, thereby insuring its reaching the table 
"piping hot." 

GLASSWARE BAKING DISHES 

The new glass dishes which have come into favor for baking are deservedly popular. 

They will resist any degree of oven temperature, are absolutely sanitary and easily 
cleaned, are not so cumbersome as earthenware and pottery casseroles, and are the last word 
in daintiness and attractiveness for table service. The process of special manufacture is such 
that the glass is almost unbreakable. 

With these glass dishes one can also see if the cake, for illustration, is done all the 
way through, instead of depending altogether on a testing straw. And dough does not stick 
to the side as with nietal cake dishes. 

Glass is an unusually excellent retainer of heat, hence these glass dishes are eco- 
nomical, in that the heat may be turned off before the food is "done" and it will finish

"cooking" itself. Somewhat as in the case of "a fireless cooker," the retention of the heat 
makes all the difference in the world, too, when the food reaches the table piping hot instead 
of lukewarm. 

The prices of these dishes are about on a par with aluminum; a little more, as yet, 
than the crockery dishes. But it must be borne in mind that they are themselves decorative 
and do not need some form of decorative holders for serving. 

THE USE OF THE OVEN 

Most American housewives appreciate too poorly the old-fashioned art of cooking 
in the oven. They turn too readily to frying and broiling. 

"En Casserole" is incomparable for making chicken and other tender meats "go far," 
and is delicious for fish and game, and for vegetables and many other foods. And the oven 
must not be disregarded. 

For oven cooking, earthenware can be had in very many convenient forms. These 
vessels are apt to crack when new, but this can be avoided if they are toughened when bought 
by plunging into cold water, which is brought to a boil and kept boiling for five minutes. The 
well-known Boston bean pot is useful for many purposes, and the blue and white stew pot. 
The new cooking glass is attractive, durable, easily cleaned and cooks very rapidly. 

As food should so far as possible be served in the dish in which it is cooked — which 
also saves dish-washing — the little ramekin is a wonder; with ingenuity all sorts of dishes of 
which in the ordinary form one may grow tired may be shaped up attractively for individual 
service in the ramekin, garnished and seasoned as a "novelty." 

Do not rebel over the "long time" that is frequently necessary for oven cooking. 
The result justifies the care; besides, in most cases, little or no attention is required — one 
may pursue other duties in the interim, and casserole cooking may often be prepared the day 
before. 

With very little thought you can have many "oven meals" — nearly all of the foods 
being cooked in the oven at the same time.

SAVE FUEL WHEN YOU COOK 

United States Food Leaflet No. I 2 

Whatever fuel you use, make it go as far as possible. Money saved on fuel can 
well be spent on better foods to cook, and if you cut down your use of fuel, you can help 
make the supply go around. 

To have a fire you must have, besides fuel, air to make it burn. In gas and oil 
stoves the air supply is regulated by the makers. In coal or wood ranges or cook stoves 
you must regulate it by means of dampers. 

LEARN TO USE EVERY DAMPER IN YOUR KITCHEN RANGE 

The important dampers are: 

1 . Damper in the ash pit which lets in the air which passes through the fuel box, 
making the fire bum. 

2. Damper over the fire controlling air to flowr in above the fire. 

3. Oven damper which switches the current of hot air around the oven instead of 
letting it go by the shorter path up the stovepipe. 

4. Check dreift damper in the stovepipe just above the range. This is not always 
found and is less important than the rest. 

5. Stove pipe damper which checks heat from escaping up the chimney. 

Make Your Fire the Right Way — ^To make a fire in a range, whether coal or wood, 
close all dampers of the stove and shake the firebox to free it from ashes, dust, and clinkers. 
Take off the lids over the fire-box, place crumpled paper in the fire-box, arrange kindlings 
over and around it so that air can pass freely between them, and put on a small shovelful 
of coal. Light the paper, open dampers Nos. I, 3, and 5, and put on lids. When the coal 
glows red, a little more coal should be added, and when the fire is burning well, the fire-box 
may be filled. If wood is used as fuel, put on a few sticks at a time. 

Leatm to Manage the Fire — By the proper use of the dampers the fire can be con- 
trolled and the heat regulated. 

No. 1 . The damper in the ash pit. This should always be kept open when the 
fire is burning as it is the best source of air for the fire. Close it only when you dump the 
grate and when the fire is banked to keep it for some time. However, if there is no stove- 
pipe damper, the damper in the ash pit must be closed to check the draft when the fire 
burns too hard. 

No. 2. The damper over the fire. Close this when you are starting a fire. If the 
fire bums too rapidly so that the flames are long enough to reach the back row of lids, open 
the damper a little bit. This will shorten the length of the flame and give you more heat. 
If you open this too much it may cool the oven. 

No. 3. The oven damper. When this damper is closed the flames and smoke and 
hot air are forced to pass around the oven to heat it and then afterwards they escape up 
the chimney. When the damper is open they pass directly up the chimney. As soon as 
the fire is burning well, close this damper so that the oven will be heated. This will keep 
the oven so that you can make it very hot quickly by adding extra fuel and will warm your 
room if the oven door is left open. With this damper closed you will use much less fuel 
than by allowing the heated air to take the shorter path up the chimney. 

No. 4. The Check draft damper in the stovepipe. It should be kept closed except 
when the fire is banked. 

No. 5. The stovepipe damper. This is a most important damper. It can control 
the amount of fuel burned, as the more slowly the hot air passes up the pipe the more 
slowly the fire burns. A great deal of the fuel sometimes merely furnishes heat that escapes

up the chimney. Check this escape of heat and burn less fuel by using the pipe damper. 
If your fire is burning too hard, instead of closing the damper in the ash pit, close the one 
in the pipe, for it checks the fire much more effectively than the oter damper. 

If your oven does not heat even with the oven damper closed, it is probably be- 
cause the air carried around the oven has been pulled through the fire so fast that it has 
not been thoroughly heated itself and can not heat the oven. Close the pipe damper. 

Keep Your Range Cleaned Out — If the fire-box is clogged with ashes, air can not 
pass through the fuel to make it burn. If soot hangs on the stove lids, less heat can come 
through it. A layer of ashes over the top and under the oven keeps it from heating quickly. 

Banking the Fire — It is an economy to keep a hard-coal fire over from day to day, 
especially if the range is used as a source of heat for the room. As a rule a wood fire is 
hard to keep over but the hard-coal fire can be easily kept. In the evening rake out the 
ashes, put coal on, and open the dampers until the fresh fuel is burning well. Put on coal 
until the fire-box is almost full and close all the dampers except the check draft damper in 
the stovepipe. 

Think of the Fire When You Select the Food to Cook — If you keep a slow fire in 
your range all day to supply heat for the room, select foods that require long, slow^ cooking. 
Baked beans or peas, roasts, and puddings can be baked in the oven and cereals cooked in a 
double boiler on the back of the stove. Avoid foods that require a very hot fire for a long 
time. 

Gas, Kerosene or Coal Oil, and Gjuoline are economical for cooking if carefully 
used. Never mix two liquid fuels and never use gasoline in an oil stove, for each requires 
a special burner. Use all with care. 

WAYS TO SAVE GAS AND OIL 

Reduce the Number of Burners Used — You can cook more than one kind of food 
over the same burner. If you have a colander or a wire basket that fits over an ordinary 
kettle, you can steam such vegetables as carrots or squash in the colander at the same 
time that you boil potatoes in the kettle. The under part of the double boiler can be used 
to boil eggs or small vegetables, while cereal cooks in the upper part. Compartment ves- 
sels that have two or three separate divisions fitting together over one burner may be pur- 
chased. 

Regulate the Size of the Flame — Turn the flame down after the boiling point is 
reached, for water that is boiling fast is no hotter than water that is boiling slowly. When 
the flame spreads up around the vessel you are wasting fuel. 

Don't Be Afraid of Relighting the Gas — Turn it out when you remove the vessel 
from the burner. Matches are cheaper than gas. 

Have a Regular Bake Day — If you bake bread, bake as much at one time as will 
be eaten before it dries out. 

Don't Light the Oven to Bake a Single Dish — If you have a roast for dinner that re- 
quires the use of the oven, plan a baked dinner. Beef roast with brown potatoes, scalloped 
tomatoes, and Apple Betty all could be baked at one time. Or, if you light the oven to bake 
quick breads or cake, bake fruit or a dessert for another meal. Small ovens that fit over 
one burner save fuel. 

Select foods that can be quickly cooked. Cook in larger quantities such foods as 
cereals and soups that require long cooking. They will keep in the refrigerator and you will 
save much fuel. Leaflet No. 1 3 tells how to make a fireless cooker at home and how to 
use it to cut down your use of fuel. No matter what kind of fuel you use, the fireless 
cooker can help you save it. 



THE FIRELESS COOKER 

There is nothing new under the sun, and the fireless cooker, which has of 
recent years come into much usage, was known to the ancients. The Chinese and 
the Crusaders knew and practiced its principle, and the "clam-bake" of the East and 
"barbecue" of the West are only special forms in which the principle is used. 

Fireless cooking does not mean cooking without fire. The cooker does not 
supply its own heat. One does not accuse a refrigerator of attempting to furnish 
its own ice. The cooker merely uses stored heat, as the refrigerator does stored 
cold. It is only that the fireless cooker retains the heat that goes into it, and gives it 
off to the cooking process later. It is economical because this surplus heat is stored 
and not lost, as is the case if the same foods are left to simmer over a fire. 

There are many advantages in the fireless cooker. There are no burned hands and 
no spoiled food if the meal is kept waiting. The utensils last a long time and are easily 
cleaned each time used — there are no blackened pans to be scrubbed. There is no unpleas- 
ant odor over the house from the cooking, and cheap cuts of meat may be used because they 
can be cooked long and slowly to soften their toughness. 

In fireless cooking the heat needed is only enough to bring the food up to the cooking 
temperature. The cooker then retains this heat, and the food continues to cook slowly until 
done, or ready to serve. It is not intense heat that cooks properly, but even heat slowly and 
steadily supplied. 

The cooker saves hours of time. Once in the cooker the food can be practically 
forgotten while one goes about other household duties. One can go shopping while the 
dinner is "cooking itself." Cereals for breakfast may be cooked over night. 

The fireless cooker may be used as an "iceless" freezer. It is simply a reversal of 
principle. Excellent mousses, custards and other desserts may be made in a cooker, with the 
application of a little cracked ice in the bottom, to give off its refrigeration later, instead of 
heat to give its cooking quality in the usual manner. 

As in any other branch of cookery, one will usually fail to get the best results at first 
in a fireless cooker. It has to be studied, and practiced a bit on the different foods until 
one gets them "just right." But one does not quit on biscuit because they do not turn out 
as expected the first time tried. Apply the same common sense to a fireless cooker; get a 
good one and keep at it for a week or so until you learn its personality, and you will not 
thereafter be without it. 

You do not need special recipes for the fireless cooker. Take any food that you 
have used on your cook stove, put it in the fireless cooker, and it will turn out better. 
Vegetables and cereals that need long cooking are of far finer flavor when cooked by this 
method. 

A food to be boiled must actually boil for five minutes before being set in the cooker; 
it must be at the boiling point all the way through. Do not try to cook too small a quantity 
of anything by this method. A small quantity does not retain the heat. 

But most especially remember it is not a matter of an intricate art or special recipes 
but rather that you get the habit of putting your foods in the filess cooker as a matter of course 
instead of on or in the stove, and your work and time will be cut in two and your food will be 
of finer flavor and more wholesome in every way.

You can't afford to be without one. The fireless cooker can save fuel in winter and 
make your kitchen comfortable in summer. It will save you time and labor for you can 
have your dinner cooking while you attend to other duties or go away from home. Make 
one for yourself. It may cost less than a dollar and will pay for itself in time and fuel saved. 
Or buy a ready-made one. 

How a Fireless Cooker Cooks — First the food is made as hot as it can be on the 
stove, then it is put immediately into the cooker. Once there, it stays hot and keeps on 
cooking. The walls of the fireless cooker keep the heat in just as the walls of a good 
refrigerator keep the heat out. 

MATERIALS NEEDED FOR A FIRELESS COOKER 

1 . The Outside Container — Any good-sized box or bucket with a tight cover — a 
grocery box, a butter firkin, a wooden candy bucket, a I 00 pound lard can, or a new gar- 
bage can. 

2. Packing Material — Soft hay excelsior, ground cork, sawdust, tightly crumpled 
newspaper, or any other good non-conducting material that can be packed in closely. This 
packing material forms a nest for the cooking vessel. 

3. The nest Lining — A metal or enamel bucket and sheet asbestos to cover the 
bucket. The bucket must have straight sides and a lid and must be of such a size as to 
allow at least three inches of packing material between it and the outside container, top, 
bottom, and sides. 

4. The Cooking Vessel — A vessel with a tight lid to fit closely into the nest lining 
and yet slip in and out easily, or two or three of the small ones especially made for the fire- 
less. The best kind is of enamel, granite or aluminum. 

5. Cardboard — To make the collar. 

6. The Cushion — Denim or muslin stuffed with the packing material. This cushion 
is to be pressed down across the top under the outside lid. 

7. Two Soapstone Disks — Purchasable at a hardware store. They are not needed 
for all cooking, but with them you can cookmore quickly and in greater variety. 

TO MAKE THE FIRELESS COOKER 

1 . Line the outside container with newspaper if a wooden box is used. 

2. Pack the bottom of the outside container compactly with a layer of the packing 
material to the depth of three inches or more. 

3. Cut a circle of asbestos two inches larger in diameter than the nest lining. Place 
the asbestos mat in the center of the packing. 

4. Cut a strip of asbestos big enough to cover completely the outside walls of the 
bucket which is to serve as the nest lining, and tie it in place. 

5. Place the bucket with its asbestos covering directly in the center on the asbestos 
mat. Hold in place and tightly fill in the space between it and the walls of the outside 
container with the packing material. Pack in solidly to within one-half inch of the top of 
the bucket. The success of your cooker depends largely upon the tightness with which 
you crowd in the packing material, which prevents the heat from escaping from your hot 
food. 



82 



THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Section IV— Part 1— TALKS ON FOOD 



6. Cut a piece of cardboard to fit in the outside container. Cut a hole in the middle 
of it which will fit closely over the bucket which forms the nest lining. This "collar" holds 
the packing material in place. 

7. Make the cushion for the top by cutting two pieces of cloth the size of the out- 
side container and putting them together with a straight strip of cloth three inches wide. 
Stuff with the packing material. 

8. Outside finishings. If a box is used for the outside container, the lid should be 
hinged and fastened down with a hook. If it is of wood, paint or stain it a dark color. 
Casters make it convenient to move about.

SOME PRECAUTIONS IN USING THE FIRELESS 

Don't let the food or disks cool before you put them in the fireless. The food will 
not cook unless there is enough heat shut up with it. Reheat the food that requires long 
cooking, if it cools before it is finished. Reheat the food before serving, if necessary. A 
small quantity of food cools quickly, so either use the disks or put a small vessel containing 
the food in the regular cooking vessel and surround it with hot water. 

Soapstone disks will increase the usefulness of your cooker. They can be heated 
hotter than the boiling point of water, and when shut up in the fireless furnish heat which 
cooks the food. If you made your fireless according to directions, you can safely use the 
disks. Heat them very hot, but do not let them get red hot for fear of cracking. With one 
below and one on top of the cooking vessel you will be able to roast meat or even to bake 
bread or puddings. Without the disks your fireless is useful only for certain kinds of food 
— cereals, beans, pot roasts, ste^vs, etc. — things that can be cooked in water.

SOME FIRELESS SPECIALTIES 



CEREALS 

Prepare as for the stove, but use one-sixth less 
water. Boil for I minutes, or longer with coarser 
cereals. Place in the cooker boiling hot and leave 
6 or 8 hours or over night. 

MEATS 

Buy cheaper cuts. The tireless can make tough 
meat tender. For more recipes see Leaflet No. 5. 

CREOLE STEW 

One pound lean beef or 1 medium fowl, 2 cups 
tomatoes, I cup carrots or okra cut small, I cup 
chopped sweet peppers, J/2 cup rice, J/^ cup 
chopped onion, I teaspoon salt, I tablespoon fat. 

Cut the meat in small pieces or cut the fowl 
into joints. Melt the fat, add the onions, peppers, 
meat or chicken. Brown for f 'ew minutes. Put 
in cooking vessel with seasoning, rice, vegetables, 
and one cup boiling 'vater. Simmer for !/£ hour 
and put in iireless for 3 hours without the disks 



or 2 hours with them. With chicken and okra this 
is the famous creole chicken of the South. 

ROASTS 

Sear the roast, season, place in the cooking 
vessel between two hot disks. Do not add water. 
Allow 25 minutes per pound. 

SOUP STOCK 

Cut up meat, crack bones, and cover with cold 
water. Let it reach the boiling point, then place 
in cooker for several hours. 

DRIED FRUITS AND VEGETABLES 

Peas, beans, corn, dried fruit soak in water 

until restored to the original size. Boil a few min- 
utes, then keep in the cooker 6 to I 2 hours. Baked 
beans or peas are especially good cooked in the 
fireless. See Leaflet No. 1 4.

FORM THE OLIVE OIL HABIT 

The medicinal value of fats is very great. Olive oil is one of the best of 
foods. It is a laxative and body builder. We are apt to forget that, like both the 
front gate and the sewing machine, the human system needs a lubricant, and for this 
there is nothing better than olive oil. 

The best varieties of olive oil come to us from Italy and France. Spain also 
produces a clear, excellent oil ; but for the American taste the Spanish oil is a little 
too strongly flavored. Indeed, we might take a valuable lesson from the Italian and 
French peasants who use olive oil almost to the exclusion of other fats, and cer- 
tainly the women of these peoples are thrifty housewives, fully aware of the eco- 
nomic excellence of the oil. When the cost of olive oil, as against that of other 
fats, is not too great for the family purse, it should be used liberally. 

Olive Oil for Cooking — With the growing demand for olive oil unfortunately the 
adulterater has put out oil that is not absolutely pure; and although Uncle Sam has almost 
stopped the adulteration with seed oils the careful housewife will find that there is only one 
safe way to avoid being imposed on with mixtures of inferior foreign oils, and that is to find 
a standard, reliable brand and refuse any substitute. 

Form the Habit — The cost of the best oil is normally in the vicinity of $1 .00 a quart, 
and although this may seem to many housewives to put it in the class of luxuries, they must 
stop and think of the varied uses and the nutritive value of good oil. 

Form the habit of keeping a quart can of oil in the refrigerator, then use it as plenti- 
fully as the purse will permit; the results in the improved cooking and family health will con- 
vince the most skeptical of its merits as a family necessity. 

Tin has now almost replaced glass as a container for olive oil, and not only because 
tin is cheaper, lighter and more convenient, but also because a strong light deteriorates olive 
oil. Keep the can of oil in an even temperature and after it is opened in a cool temperature; 
and as it is quick to absorb other odors keep it corked or tightly closed. 

To make olive oil recipes the success they should be, the following must be observed : 
Buy quart cans. Buy a known and reliable brand, and once you are suited accept no substi- 
tute and don't look for "bargains" — they will result in dissatisfaction. 

Almost everything to be fried is improved by being cooked in olive oil. Apples, 
eggs, omelets, and even steaks or cutlets are delicious when cooked in this way, while a steak 
whose tenderness is in doubt will be rendered excellent if it is saturated in a mixture of 
olive oil and a tablespoonful of lemon juice. 

Fritter batters, corn, oysters, etc., will prove a revelation if oil is used for the shorten- 
ing, as they will be lighter, far more delicate and consequently easier of digestion. 

Certain other vegetable oils are very good and, except for flavor, very nearly as 
desirable as olive oil. It is not intended here to recommend the exclusive use of olive oil 
over these others, which are in most cases absolutely pure and w^holesome. But the use of 
olive oil is not ordinarily appreciated to the extent it should be, and the housewife should by 
all means "form the habit" of using it as freely as she can.

Flour, sugar, soda, etc., should be sifted before measuring. 

Do not pack these in measuring. 

Butter, lard, etc., however, should be packed, and then made level with

lished custom. This is more iivholesome as well as economical and sensible in every way.

CARE OF UTENSILS AND GENERAL CONVENIENCES 

There are two maxims which the housewife should have in mind when she 
enters her kitchen workshop. They are: "Plan your work and work your plan," 
and "A place for everything and everything in its place." 

A few simple articles kept handy and a little judgment used in the arrange- 
ment of shelves, tables and hooks, w^ill do wonders tov^ards lessening labor and 
saving steps. 

The old saying that it is as cheap to sit as to stand should be observed in 
the kitchen of all places. A revolving stool, or any kind of high chair or seat, 
will prove a boon to the kitchen worker. It is not a sign of laziness but of con- 
servation to sit while you work. 

Have tables and chairs and shelves arranged to suit your height; stooping 
and bending tire unnecessarily. 

Above all things, learn to think. In making trips to the pantry, ice box or 
cellar, take things to be left there, and bring others on the same trip. Heed the 
old saying, "Make your head save your heels." 



TABLE AND KITCHEN UTENSILS 

(From "Selection of Household Equipment" — Yearbook, Department of Agriculture) 

Table and kitchen utensils make up an important group of furnishings. Very 
often the same kind of articles in different qualities are found in both sets. Table plates 
differ from kitchen plates more in their unattractiveness than in any other way. Real china 
or porcelain, which is always translucent and of which the choice tablewares are usually 
made, is more suitable for occasional than general use because it is rather fragile, but its light 
weight, fine color and smooth surface are undeniably beautiful. Earthenware with a good 
glaze usually ranks next to porcelain and is very satisfactory for general use. The old blue 
and white Staffordshire wares, which were so highly prized in colonial days in this country, 
belonged to this type, and similar ware is still to be obtained in many satisfactory designs, 

93 



94 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Sec. IV— Pt. 2— COOKING AND RECIPES 

one of the common ones being the well known wilow pattern. Large and conspicuous 
designs usually become tiresome on things which are used as frequently as table dishes and 
it is safer to select plain white or some all-over pattern or inconspicuous bands of flowers, 
color or gilt. It is usually wiser to buy tableware from an open-stock design than to take 
the regular sets, which often include unnecessary pieces and cannot always be replaced 
when broken. Good, plain shapes are ordinarily to be preferred to more fancy ones, 
because they are better adapted to their purposes and are easier to clean than those which 
have irregular surfaces w^hich catch and hold the dust. Pitchers, teapots and other dishes 
with openings so small that the hand cannot be inserted to wash and wipe them are to 
be avoided, or a teapot which is hard to clean on account of an elaborate handle. Kitchen 
crockery, like tableware, should have a good, smooth-finished glaze which will clean easily 
and not chip. 

Glassware is to be obtained in almost any grade, from the most expensive cut- 
glass to the coarse kind used in jelly tumblers. The choice depends on the pocketbook, 
but it should not be forgotten that plain glass or glass cut in a simple pattern is easier to 
keep shining and is usually more beautiful than any except possibly the very expensive 
types of elaborately ornamented glass. 

Knives, forks and spoons are made in several kinds of metal. Silver is the most 
durable and always has an intrinsic value. Plated silver is made so well and so cheaply 
nowadays that almost every family can have at least a supply of forks and spoons. Merny 
prefer steel-bladed to silver knives for the main course at a meal because they cut better, 
but they are harder to care for than silver or plated ones. Tea sets, pitchers and other 
serving dishes come in good designs in plated as w^ell as solid silver. If the family hap- 
pens to own handsome ones, they make appropriate sideboard ornaments; but they require 
frequent rubbing up to keep them bright, eind unless they are needed every day on the 
table it is better to put them away and reserve them for special occasions than to let 
them stand about tarnished. 

There is much discussion as to the best material for cooking utensils. The truth 
is that no material is best for all, and the ■work is most easily and satisfactorily done if 
different kinds are chosen for different needs. Earthenware is excellent for certain pur- 
poses, as it holds the heat evenly, and baking dishes or casseroles in which the food can 
be served as well as cooked save dishwashing. Such wares are not adapted to all kinds 
of cooking, however. The great heat of fat in frying, for example, especially when the 
hot fat spatters up against the cooler parts of the dish, is likely to crack it. Enameled 
ware is light in weight, easy to clean, and is little affected by acids; it is excellent for 
mixing dishes and for keeping food in, but the cheaper grades do not always stand the 
heat of cooking well and soon chip. The enamel should be free from bubbles and have 
smooth, evenly finished edges which will not chip readily. Aluminum heats quickly and so 
economizes fuel, comes in very good shapes, is light to handle and very durable; it is 
affected by alkalis, discolors easily and is rather hard to clean. Nevertheless, since it does 
not rust, it is especially desirable for teakettles, double boilers, kettle covers, etc. Cast 
iron is still common ware for kitchen utensils, but it is being replaced in many homes by 
materials which are lighter in weight and less expensive. Good iron pans and skillets are 
excellent for some kinds of cooking, however, because they heat more evenly than those 
of other materials, and they last for generations. Iron rusts easily and is affected by acids 
as aluminum is by alkalis. It is because of the action of acids that iron dishes sometimes 
injure the color and flavor of food, and for this reason food, especially acid food, is 
usually not allowed to stand in them. Tin and sheet iron plated with tin are in common 
use in most kitchens because they are rather inexpensive, but they are not entirely satisfac- 
tory. Unless they are unusually heavy, they lose their shape quickly, and in thinly plated 
kinds the tin wears off and the iron beneath rusts easily.

KITCHEN HELPS— UTENSILS, CHOICE AND CARE 95 

The shape of kettles has much to do with the quickness with which their contents 
heat. The smaller the surface which comes in contact with the heat, the longer it will take 
the contents to become warm, and vice versa. This means that in a kettle with a broad 
base the contents heat more quickly than in one with a small base. TTie point should 
especially be considered where gas stoves are employed and fuel must be carefully used. 

Because a thing is to be used in the kitchen is no reason why it should be ugly 
to look at, and if the housekeeper can find mixing bowls and kettles which are attractive 
in shape, color and finish, as well as convenient and easy to clean, they will give her a 
sense of pleasure every time they are used. 



CHOICE AND CARE OF UTENSILS 

(Extracts from Bulletin under above title, being Farm House Series No. 5, 
Cornell Reading Course Lessons for the Farm Home) 

POINTS TO BE CONSIDERED IN CHOICE OF UTENSILS 

In order to choose a utensil deserving of its name, something fit for use, we must 
consider the following points: 

Is the utansil genuine, "as advertised"? No other investment of money is so 
bitterly regretted as one that calls for the admission, "TTiis was not worth buying at any 
price." 

Is the utensil durable? A purchase of permanent equipment should add enough 
to the value of the working plant so that it need not be charged as an expense against the 
year of its purchase, but may be treated as an investment covering as many years as its 
usefulness continues. 

Is the utensil convenient to handle? This depends on more than mere lack of 
weight. A heavy utensil, well balanced, with handle or bail set in just the right place 
and way, may be easier to use than a lighter one in which these points were not con- 
sidered and which must be kept balanced by hand and wrist in order not to tip. 

For a utensil of moderate size, easily lifted with one hand, occupying little space 
in itself and intended for use on top of the stove only, a fairly long handle is best; it does 
not get in the way of the cover or contents to be poured out, and may be so constructed 
as not to grow uncomfortably hot to the hand. 

It is convenient, at times, to have a utensil that may be transferred at will from 
the top of the stove to the oven. For this purpose utensils are made with a very short 
handle or with two handles of the sugar-bowl type. 

The half-circle metal bail is best reserved for vessels so large in themselves as to 
require much stove and storage space and needing two hands to lift them. 

What kind of cover shall we choose? For long, slow cooking, when the purpose 
is to conserve heat, moisture and flavor, a tight fitting cover is necessary. For rapid boil- 
ing, where much steam is being produced, an easily removed cover is an essential safe- 
guard. 

Is the lip of the utensil in the right place? Lips of utensils should be on the side 
that is convenient, according as we are right or left-handed. How many fulfill this re- 
quirement? Those with lip on each side are plainly sensible. Most utensils are designed 
to be held in the right hand while pouring one liquid into another. This necessitates either 
stirring with the left hand — a difficult operation — or alternately pouring and stirring with 
the right hand. 

Is the utensil easy to clean? In order to insure ease of cleaning, a utensil should 
be made of one piece of metal with rounded edges or sides, not with seams or corners. 



96 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Sec. IV— Pt. 2— COOKING AND RECIPES 

It should not have a rolled rim with a rough edge underneath. The joining of utensil 
and handle should not offer grooves or tunnels as gathering places for particles of grease, 
dust and soap. It is imperatively important that the inside rather than the outside of the 
utensil be smooth, polished and consequently easy to clean. The opening should be wide 
enough to permit easy access to every part of the utensil. 

Is the utensil of proper size and shape for the amount and kind of cooking to be 
done? The pan that makes an ideal omelet for three would produce a very unevenly 
cooked dish if used for an omelet for six. The breakfast cereal for a small family, if put 
into a large kettle in the fireless cooker, w^ould soon lose its small stock of heat and 
remain raw. 

If a gas or an oil stove is used, the size of the bottom of the utensil greatly affects 
economy of fuel, time of cooking, and quality of the finished product. If utensils fail to fit 
the burner, a thin stove-lid of the proper size may be placed over the flame. 

The time needed for evaporation, or boiling down, depends on the amount of sur- 
face exposed; hence evaporation will go on more rapidly in a utensil that flares at the tip 
than in one ■whose top and bottom are of the same size. The contents of a utensil made 
of material that is a good conductor of heat, such as aluminum, will boil down more rapidly 
than if put into an agateware utensil of the same size. 

Is the utensil safe as a food receptacle? There must be no risk of forming poison- 
ous compounds. As an illustration: we avoid the use of an iron utensil in canning and 
preserving, because we know that iron and fruit acids together form a compound which, 
although not actually harmful — iron being needed often in the blood — is of little value when 
taken in this form, and is at least a discoloring agent for the food and therefore detracting 
from the appetizing appearance. And this caution should go a step farther. If an enamel 
kettle has become chipped, so that the iron foundation and the acid can combine, it is best 
not to use it for cooking acid foods; even if the danger to health is slight, there remains 
the possible economic loss through impaired flavor or through scorching, as well as the chance 
that chips of enamel may find their way into the food. 

UTENSILS BEST ADAPTED TO THE DIFFERENT PROCESSES 
OF COOKING 

BAKING — Cake — Tin, if well cared for, is the metal best adapted for cake making. 
TTie round tin with a tube in the centre, known as an angel-cake tin, produces the most level 
and evenly baked cake, owing to the fact that the heat reaches the center of the cake as 
soon as any other part. A plain round tin, not too deep, gives the next best result; a square 
tin is next, w^hile an oblong tin requires very careful regulation of heat in order to produce a 
well-baked cake. 

Bread — :The choice of utensils for bread baking lies between tin and Russia-iron (a 
sheet iron treated by a process having a polished blue-black surface) . Since bread requires 
a hotter oven than does cake, the Russia-iron pan should have first choice; it absorbs more 
heat than does tin, is less affected by high temperature and is more durable. 

Pie — It has been found that the best results are obtained from the use of granite- 
ware plates, that old tin plates are next in order, while perforated and wire plates come 
third. 

Cookies — Cookies are best baked on Russia-iron sheets cut to fit the oven, with 
heavy tin sheets as second choice. 

MEATS — Roasting — Roasts require a high temperature at the start in order to sear 
the surface; for this reason the best choice is a pan of iron or high-grade granite ware. 
An oval pan can be more carefully cleaned than one with sharp corners. 



KITCHEN HELPS— UTENSILS. CHOICE AND CARE 97 

Pot Roasts — The iron kettle with a tight-fitting cover, called also the "Dutch 
oven," best supplies the steady heat that a pot roast needs. Although a casserole may be 
used, or a bean pot with weixed paper tied tightly over the top, in either of these there is 
more evaporation than in the iron kettle, and the roast is therefore drier, although just as 
tender. 

Meat Stews — Since in stews more liquid is added than in pot roasts, the casserole 
may well be used, or a shallow aluminum or granite-ware stewpan with close-fitting cover, 
straight sides, and very short or loop-shaped handles. The long, slow cooking may thus 
be done either in the oven or on top of the stove. In brown stews, the meat is first sauteed 
in an iron pan in order to give the desired color and flavor. 

Stewing Fruits or Vegetables — Aluminum, granite, or enamel ware is equally good 
for this purpose. A wide, shallow type of saucepan, with well-fitting cover, should be 
selected for fruits and for such vegetables as require to be cooked in a small amount of 
water; while a deep saucepan, without a cover, is best for the cooking of strong-juiced 
vegetables that need a large amount of water. 

Sauteing — A rather heavy iron or steel frying-pan is best adapted for this pur- 
pose. In a thin pan, or in one of granite-ware, the fat passes too soon from the tempera- 
ture at which it forms the desired golden-brown crust on the food to be cooked to the 
point where it begins to decompose and become irritating to the mucous membranes. 

Frying — For frying in deep fat use an iron or steel frying kettle, which may either 
be bowl-shaped or have straight sides. The latter shape accommodates a greater number 
of articles at a time, and is more convenient for use with a wire frying basket, since the 
basket fits it more readily. In using the bowl-shaped kettle, a long handled skimmer 
may be found more convenient for removing the food. The kettle should be deep enough 
so that when it is two-thirds full of fat the food to be cooked will be entirely immersed. 

Candy-Making — Professional confectioners use a copper kettle. For the home candy- 
maker, aluminum comes nearest to copper in its quality of conducting heat. Syrup boiled 
in an aluminum kettle rarely scorches, and the smooth surface makes it easy to keep the 
sides wiped free from sugar crystals as they form. 

Jelly-Making — Enamel or granite-ware (unless there is a defect in the enamel 
finish) is the best selection for jelly-making, because of the ease with which it may be 
cleaned and the certainty that it will neither affect nor be affected by the acid of fruit 
juices. 

CHOICE OF VARIOUS UTENSILS 

Knives — The assortment of knives should include a bread knife, butcher's knife, a 
knife with waved edge for cutting fresh bread and cake, and a palette knife, used by 
artists in cleaning palettes and adopted in every kitchen where cooking is classed among 
the fine arts, as by means of it a bowl may be so completely freed from the batter that 
was mixed in it as to reduce dish-washing to a minimum, while increasing the quantity 
of cake obtained to a maximum. 

Heating Knives-^ — To preserve the temper of steel knives, we must avoid the practice 
of heating the blade on top of the stove to facilitate cutting fresh bread or cake. Allow- 
ing hot water to run over the blade accomplishes the same purpose without injury to the 
knife, and this should always be done in cutting a frosted cake, in order not to mar the 
frosting. 

Egg Beaters — Different types of egg beaters are needed, according to the con- 
sistency desired in the beaten whites. For all-round use, the Dover egg beater is a good 



98 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Sec. IV— Pt. 2— COOKING AND RECIPES 

choice, because it ■works most quickly. The balloon-shaped egg whisk made of piano wire 
carries more air into the mixture, and the flat wire beater gives the airiest texture of all. 
Either of the latter types is preferable to the Dover egg beater for angel-cake, sponge 
cake or meringues. 

Spoons — ^Spoons of hard wood should be used whenever possible; they are lighter 
than metal ones, do not discolor the hand, make less noise, do not get hot to the hand, 
and do not scratch metal surfaces. For basting roasts, or whenever a specially strong 
spoon is needed, a tinned iron spoon is good. Enamel spoons are not practical, as they 
are likely to bend and crack the enamel. 

Pastry and Vegetable Brushes — If brushes are used in connection with food — that 
is, for greasing pans or for brushing rolls or pastry with butter, eggs or milk — they must 
be of a kind that can be cleansed with boiling water. This is impossible if the bristles 
are glued in. The bristles should be strong and pliable and should be bound to the handle 
with twine rather than metal. Small wooden-backed brushes are indispensable for the 
proper cleaning of vegetables, for brushing grated lemon rind from the grater, and for 
many other purposes. A round pitcher- or bottle-brush, and a long wire-handled trap 
brush for the refrigerator, are sanitary necessities. 

PREPARING NEW UTENSILS FOR USE 

Iron, Tin and Enamel Ware — It is a general custom to prepare a new iron utensil 
for use, after thorough cleansing, by rubbing unsalted fat over it and baking the fat in. The 
same treatment is adapted to tin, for while it destroys its shiny new appearance, it protects 
the tin from rust and increases its capacity for holding heat. Enamel ware, too, is said to 
be protected from cracking and chipping if it is well rubbed with fat before being used for 
the first time; the fat, however, cannot be baked in as with tin and iron, since it would not 
be absorbed, but only burned fast to the glaze. 

Glass — Tumblers, jars and lamp chimneys may be toughened by putting them into a 
kettle of cold water, bringing it gradually to the boil, and after boiling a few minutes allow- 
ing it to gradually cool again. ' 

Machinery — Egg beaters, ice cream freezers, and any other utensil in which there is 
friction between two parts, should be carefully oiled before using, the wheels turned until 
the oil has reached every part, and all surplus oil wiped off before the utensil is used for 
food. The bearings should never be put in water, since they cannot be perfectly dried and 
therefore would become roughened and clogged by rust. 

PROLONGING THE USEFULNESS OF UTENSILS 

Repair Kit — A well stocked repair kit is a necessary part of the up-to-date kitchen, 
in fact it applies to the home generally. If we calculate the time, strength and nervous force 
wasted in trying to use a teakettle lid with a loose knob, as against the time that it would 
take to tighten the nut which holds that knob if only the screwdriver were close at hand; 
in hunting for the kitchen memorandum in a drawer when a nail and hammer would fasten 
it to the wall; in tugging at a warped pantry door when a few strokes of the plane would 
make it open and close easily; in slamming a door that will not close in any other way, for- 
the lack of a drop of oil on the catch; in having to discard a pet saucepan in the midst of 
preparing a company dinner because a tiny hole makes it useless, w^hen a drop of solder 
would cure the trouble; in trying to carve meat or cut bread with a dull knife, when the pos- 
session of a knife sharpener and the knowledge of how to use it would make the process 
a pleasure: we shall readily see w^hat a change would be wrought by the possession of a 



KITCHEN HELPS— UTENSILS, CHOICE AND CARE 99 

toolchest containing hammer, screwdriver, plane, pliers, oil can, saw, soldering outfit, knife 
sharpener, twine, shears, and such nails, tacks, screws and hooks as are most often in demand. 

PROTECTION OF UTENSILS NOT IN USE 

If the house is to be closed for a time, or if for any other reason the utensils are 
to be set aside, all metals should be protected from dampness by a coating of vaseline, 
paraffin, or unsalted fat of some kind. 

MATERIALS AND THEIR CARE. 

Iron and Steel — Of the metals used in our kitchens, iron in its three varieties — cast 
iron, wrought iron and steel — is most common. Besides the utensils commonly known as 
iron and steel, we have also those in which iron or steel form the foundation; tin, galvan- 
ized iron, enamel, and nickel-plated ware. 

A good iron or steel utensil, well cared for, grows better the longer it is used. 
The two essentials are that it be kept dry and that it be kept smooth. The chief foe of iron 
is rust, caused by the action of moist air. Rust in itself has no harmful effect on food, 
but by roughening the utensil it makes it insanitary. Moreover, rust once started pro- 
ceeds rapidly to eat into the utensil that it has attacked. 

Some cooks assert that an iron utensil should never be washed, but only thoroughly 
rubbed after use, in order that its surface may be protected by a constant coating of fat. 
However, if the air cannot attack the iron, it does attack the fat, causing decomposition 
which will taint the food cooked in such a utensil. The best way, therefore, to clean an iron 
utensil is to boil in it a solution of washing soda, rinse it with boiling w^ater, and see that it 
is thoroughly dry before being put away. Iron that is put away for a time should be pro- 
tected with paraffin. 

Tin — The better grades of tin are not affected by the air, by weak acids such as 
vinegar or fruit juices, or by alkalis; they therefore effectually protect the steel foundation. 
Cheap grades, however, are not proof against the action of acids, and all grades are likely 
to change under the action of acids when hot. The quality of tin used may be determined 
by noting how a piece is marked, X being the cheapest and XXXX the best quality. 

Tin utensils must be carefully protected from scratches, since every scratch, by mar- 
ring the soft metal, exposes the steel foundation and is soon follow^ed by a streak of rust. 
A tin utensil and a metal spoon should therefore never be used in combination, nor should 
a metal scraper be used for cleaning tin. Washing in hot soapsuds, boiling in a weak solu- 
tion of washing soda, rubbing with whiting or one of the prepared cleaning powders, are the 
best ways of caring for tin. 

A Pointer on Bread and Cake Boxes — Tin storage receptacles are good for keep- 
ing cookies and cake, but stone crocks are better for bread. The difference lies in the 
fact that the process of growing stale is a different one in each case. Cookies turn stale 
by absorbing moisture from outside; therefore they require that moisture be kept away. 
This the impervious tin cake-box does, especially if we add to the contents a few pieces 
of charcoal to absorb what little moisture may accumulate. Bread grows stale by a shift- 
ing of its own moisture from crumb to crust. A fresh loaf has a crisp crust and a soft 
crumb, while in a stale loaf the reverse is true. In a tin box, especially if it be unven- 
tilated, this moisture, held in the crusf, soon makes a musty loaf. In a stone crock, which 
is porous, the moisture has a chance to escape, the crust becomes less soggy, and the 
flavor of the loaf is better maintained. In cake, where there is less difference in texture 
between the outside and the inside of the loaf, staleness consists in a gradual general loss 
of moisture. Cake is therefore better kept in tin, with the addition of a receptacle con- 



1 00 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Sec. IV— Pt. 2— COOKING AND RECIPES 

taining water, to be daily renewed. If cake and bread be stored in the same box, the 
cake will take up moisture (and incidentally a bready flavor) from the bread and remain 
moist longer, while the bread will dry faster than when stored by itself. 

Granite and Elnamel Ware — Granite and enamel ware are made by coating sheet iron 
or steel utensils with an enamel or glaze. Two or three coats of enamel are applied suc- 
cessively. The quality of the enamel depends on the ingredients used and on the num- 
ber of coats applied. Durability of granite and enamel ware depends no less on the quality 
of the steel or iron foundation than on the enamel finish. The foundation should be firm 
enough so that it will not bend or dent easily, since this inevitably cracks the enamel. 
The tendency to bend makes enamel spoons unpractical. 

"Seconds" — There is a mistaken belief that if we avoid so-called "seconds" we are 
sure of getting a good article. As a matter of fact, it is only conscientious manufacturers 
who test their wares and set aside as "seconds" pieces that are not perfect in color or shape, 
or that show in the bend of the utensil pinholes which the enamel failed to cover perfectly. 
If the perfect pieces, or "firsts," made by such a firm are beyond our purse, we are safer 
in buying their "seconds" than in choosing cheap "firsts" so-called. A poor quality of enamel 
soon wears off or loses its gloss and may even discolor and dissolve in the dishwater. 

Galvanized Iron — If iron, instead of being coated with tin or enamel, is dipped into 
melted zinc, it is known as galvanized iron. The zinc coating makes iron rust-proof, hence 
galvanized iron is the best material for garbage cans, refrigerator pans, and the like. Zinc 
is affected by the action of salt by the seashore, so that it does not last well, and it is not 
safe for use in cooking utensils because it is affected by both acids and alkalis. 

Nickel-Plated Ware — Another coating given to iron is melted nickel, the product 
being called nickel-plated ware. This takes on a high polish, does not rust and is easily kept 
clean. It is therefore much used for coffeepots, chafing dishes and other utensils designed 
for table use. Its durability makes it desirable for use in institutions, but its weight and 
cost bar it to a great extent from the private kitchen. Nickel-plated ware is kept in good 
condition by washing in hot soapsuds and rinsing in very hot water. It very rarely needs 
friction, but may be rubbed if necessary with a paste made of whiting and lard. 

Aluminum — Aluminum has come more and more into general use since the cost of 
producing it has ceased to bar it out. The advantage of aluminum utensils is that they are 
light, well made, easily cleaned, and are excellent conductors of heat. Milk, rice, sugar 
and other easily scorched foods are comparatively safe in aluminum. 

Aluminum does not withstand a high temperature. If heated over a gas or oil 
stove, the flame should not be turned on full ; if over wood or coal, the stove lid should be 
left on. Many complaints of the warping of aluminum have been due to not using this 
precaution. An aluminum utensil may be injured by allow^ing some foods to remain in 
it for any length of time. 

The outside of aluminum utensils can be kept bright by the use of any kind of 
metal polish that is not gritty. The inside surface is darkened by water containing alkalis or 
iron. This thin, dark coating is easily removed by the use of whiting or any of the 
cleaning powders that do not contain free alkali. If food or grease is burned into the sur- 
face, it can usually be soaked loose by keeping hot water in the utensil for several hours; 
after which it may be scraped with a wooden spoon. If this fails, the utensil may be 
scoured with fine sand or powdered emery or fine steel wool. The mild acid of sour milk 
or tart apples, boiled in aluminum, will brighten it very effectually. 

Copper — Copper is, next to silver, the best metallic conductor of heat. Ifc? use in the 
household is limited because of its expense and w^eight, the danger from its use w^hen not 
properly cleaned, and the labor involved in keeping it in good condition. Vegetables, acid 



KITCHEN HELPS — UTENSILS and MISCELLANEOUS 101^ 

fruits, or preserves, if cooked in copper, should not be left for a moment after they are 
done. Copper and acid, when exposed to the air, form verdigris, which we all know to be 
very poisonous. The green coloring that forms when copper is exposed to moist air alone 
is not verdigris, although it is often so called. Copper cooking utensils should be washed 
with washing soda in order to remove all grease; stains should be removed with salt and 
vinegar, or with oxalic acid; and the utensil should then be thoroughly rinsed. Unless the 
acid used for cleaning is thoroughly rinsed off, copper will tarnish the more quickly because 
of its use. The acid may be further counteracted by rubbing with whiting, if not stained, 
copper is best brightened by rubbing with rottenstone or tripoli and sweet oil. 

Silver — Silver is of all metals the best conductor of heat, but its costliness bars it 
out as a cooking utensil. Silver has to be combined with copper in order to make a compound 
hard enough for use. Plated silver is copper with a thin coating of silver applied by elec- 
tricity. Silver does not tarnish, that is, grow dark, unless it comes in contact with sulphur. 
"Oxidized" silver has been treated with sulphur — in other words, purposely tarnished. If 
our silver discolors badly, there is an escape of sulphur either from our fires or from our 
lights; or the silver has been stored near rubber, or it has been wrapped in paper or cloth 
bleached with sulphur; or it has been used in eating eggs; or it has been handled with bare 
hands. The rule against handling silver with the bare hand in wiping it or in setting the 
table is a labor-si.ving one, since human perspiration contains sulphur and a warm, moist 
hand is sure to leave its mark. 

Cloudiness in silver, with no change of color, may be due to imperfect rinsing or 
to that film of dust and moisture present in any room not perfectly ventilated where human 
beings work and breathe. Plenty of hot soapsuds, careful rinsing and wiping, will remove 
this film without the need of much rubbing. To remove tarnish, the use of silver polish, 
or of something that replaces it, is necessary. Silver is successfully cleaned by boiling it for 
five minutes in a new or bright aluminum or tin dish, in a solution made of one tablespoon 
of baking soda and a tablespoon of salt to every quart of water. The aluminum utensil must 
be kept scoured or it will not be effective. Most silver polishes have whiting for a founda- 
tion, made into a paste with either water, soap and water, alcohol, or, for solid silver, am- 
monia. 

Pottery — Porcelain, stoneware and earthenware all have clay for a foundation, but 
differ in appearance and quality according to the fineness of the clay used, the kind of 
glaze applied, and the length of time taken for firing. Good stoneware can hardly be dis- 
tinguished at first glance from porcelain, but its glaze is of a kind that easily becomes 
scratched or covered with fine cracks. Earthenware is made of the cheapest grades of clay, 
and its glaze — which is produced by throwing common salt into the furnace during the 
firing of the ware — is easily chipped, exposing the very porous ware underneath. For 
this reason white stoneware mixing bowls are in the end cheaper than yellow earthenw^are. 

Fireproof ware is made of clay which contains little or no iron, and which therefore 
withstands fire. Utensils of this kind are often left unglazed, but more often they are cov- 
ered with a glaze that is fired at a sufficiently high temperature to make a hard, smooth, 
glassy surface, which is proof alike against high heat and the effect of acids. Fireproof 
earthenware has long been represented in our kitchens in the shape of the Boston bean pot. 
We now have, in addition, a large variety of "casserole" dishes. The economy of long, slow 
cooking, whereby the cheaper cuts of meat are made digestible and palatable, is being given 
more and more consideration. Utensils that are equally useful for cooking and serving save 
time and strength in addition. 

If stoneware, earthenware or china dishes are to be allowed, after washing, to dry 
without wiping, it is important that the rinsing water be very hot and very clean. Imper- 
fectly rinsed dishes, dried without wiping, become coated with a thin film which in time spoils 
the glaze. 



1 02 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Sec. IV— Pt. 2— COOKING AND RECIPES 

Glass — Glass is made by melting together sand, a lead or lime compound and a 
compound of soda or potash. The quality depends very much on the purity of the raw mate- 
rial. Glass is being more and more used in our kitchens, for measuring cups, rolling-pins, 
storage jars for cereals, milk bottles, jelly and preserving glasses. The glass door for our 
ovens and glass tops for our percolators not only save time and motions, but also satisfy the 
general desire to see things actually happening. Glass of good quality is durable if handled 
properly. ^ 

Wood — Steak Planks — With the passing of wood for other uses, many persons are 
just discovering that meat cooked on a well-seasoned oak plank has a flavor unlike Euiy 
other, and comes near to filling the desire for "some new animal" which every household 
voices from time to time. A home carpenter may earn much gratitude by making one 
of these planks. It should be oval, an inch to an inch and a half thick, about eighteen inches 
long by twelve inches wide, vfith a depression at one end for holding the juices and wth 
gn-ooves leading toward the depression. As sold in the shops, the planks are furnished with 
trays on which to bring them to the table, but any oval tray fulfills the same purpose; in 
fact, the plank may be made to fit a tray already in use. To make the planks non-ab- 
sorbent, after thoroughly cleansing them rub in all the oil (suitable for coming in contact with 
food) that the wood will take up. 



KITCHEN UTENSILS— MISCELLANEOUS 



To Clean Granite Ware — (Cornell Reading 
Course) — Apparatus: A vessel large enough to 
hold the utensil being cleaned, and one that will 
not be affected by strong soda solution; washing 
soda, bath brick, dishcloth and dish towel. 

Place the utensils to be cleaned in the larger 
vessel. Nearly fill with cold water. Add soda in 
the proportion of one-half cup soda to one quart 
cold water. Let boil for an hour until most of 
the dirt will rinse off readily. Take the utensils 
out of the water and rinse under the tap. If 
necessary scour the utensils with bath brick or 
Sapolio in order to remove obstinate spots. Wash 
like ordinary dishes. In extreme cases it may be 
necessary to repeat this operation several times. 

To Clean Ironware — (Cornell Reading Course) 
— Apparatus: An old newspaper, a flannelette 
duster, a lump of beesvirax or mutton fat tied in 
a square of cloth, a piece of old cloth for scour- 
ing, some coarse salt, and a basin of soapy water. 

Procedure to Season New Ironware — Heat the 
iron utensil hot enough to melt the wax or fat. 
Spread the newspaper on the table; rub the uten- 
sil with the wax or fat. Wash in hot, soapy water. 
Repeat several times if necessary. 

To Clean Rusty Ironware — Spread the news- 
paper on the tabel. If very rusty rub the ironware 
with kerosene and let stand for an hour, or longer 
if necessary, before further treatment. Heat the 
utensil enough to melt the wax or fat. Rub with 
wax or fat until well covered; then scour off with 
salt. Wash the utensil with hot soapsuds and dry. 
Heat until thoroughly dry. If the weather is 
damp or the ironware is being put away for some 



time, rub with wax, vaseline or saltless fat of any 
kind, in order to prevent rust. 

Note — It may sometimes be necessary to use 
finely pulverized bathbrick in addition to the salt. 
Flatirons should be cleaned as described for iron- 
ware. 

To Clean Steel of rust, rub the rusted part with 
sweet oil and allow to stand for 24 hours; then 
rub with a piece of soft leather and sprinkle with 
finely powdered unslaked lime until the rust dis- 
appears. 

To Clean Knives of rust, use a raw potato 
dipped in cleaning powder. 

Cake Griddle — Keep this in good condition 
largely by the vociferous use of sandpaper oc- 
casionally, using very little grease for frying the 
cakes. 

To Clean Brass and Copper — (Cornell Read- 
ing Course) — Apparatus: Rottenstone, sweet 
oil, scouring flannels, chamois skin, clean dry 
towel, and a saucer; also, if necessary, a soft 
brush. 

Wash the article in hot soapy water. If badly 
tarnished, it may be necessary to make a weak 
solution of oxalic acid and rub this over the 
article before washing it. The acid, however, is 
a dangerous thing to use if the skin is broken 
anywhere on the hands. It should be kept off 
the hands in any event. 

Mix a little paste of rottenstone and oil in the 
saucer and scour the brass vigorously with it. 
Be especially careful to get it into crevices and 
corners. 

Wash thoroughly with hot water and soap. 



KITCHEN HELPS— UTENSILS AND MISCELLANEOUS 



103 



rinse, and dry. If the article seenis greasy after 
the washing, the water was not sufficiently soapy 
and the 'washing should be done over. 

Polish with chamois skin. 

Wash out the cloths and chamois skin and hang 
them up to dry. 

Note If the article is very badly tarnished it 

may be rubbed with fine emery paper, or finely 
pulverized pumice stone may be used as a paste 
with the acid or with water, rubbing vigorously. 

Brass Saucepan — To clean a brass saucepan or 
preserving can quickly, put in it a little bath- 
brick and moisten it with vinegar; this will at 
once remove the stain. 

Copper Kettles, etc., may often be cleaned by 
rubbing all over with a cut lemon dipped in salt, 
then rinsing thoroughly with clear water and pol- 
ishing with a soft cloth or chamois. Or a little 
pov^rdered bathbrick moistened with vinegar; mix 
to a paste and rub e little on the copper; let it 
stand for a time, then rub off and polish v?ith a 
soft cloth; wash off and polish finally with 
chamois. 

To Clean Zinc — (Cornell Reading Course) — 
Apparatus: The kerosene can, some cotton 
waste or an old cloth, a bottle of vinegar and 
alum mixture (see below) and an old pot. 

Take a piece of cotton waste or an old cloth, 
pour a little kerosene on the zinc, and spread it 
all over with the waste or cloth. Start at one 
corner with the waste or cloth and rub hard un- 
til the zinc is clean and bright. Finally, rub off 
all superfluous kerosene with a piece of fresh 
waste. 

If the zinc has been neglected and is very dirty, 
heat some of the vinegar and alum mixture in 
the old pot. Apply it hot, rub hard, and wipe 
off immediately. 

Burn the waste. 

Vinegar and Alum Mixture — 2 oz. powdered 
alum; I qt. strong vinegar. Boil the vinegar, add 
the alum, and stir until dissolved. Apply hot. 
Badly stained nickel can also be cleaned by boil- 
ing in this mixture until the stains begin to dis- 
appear, before polishing. Keep in a tightly corked 
bottle. 

To Clean Badly Stained Nickel — See immedi- 
ately above: vinegar and alum mixture for zinc. 

Tinware — Before using tinware of any kind, rub 
well over with fresh lard, to season, and fortify 
against rust later. To clean tinware, wash with 
hot soda water, dry, then polish with dry flour 
applied with soft leather, and then rub with leather 
only. 



Stains on Tinware or Teacups can be removed 
by dipping a damp cloth in common soda and 
rubbing briskly. Wash and wipe dry. 

Get a Wide-Mouthed Funnel and keep it on 
hand, among your tinware supplies; it is most 
convenient for pouring from one bowl to another; 
you will find use for it every day; it prevents 
spilling and slopping, which largely causes various 
stains on utensils generally, the thin coating of 
the spilled liquid burning dry immediately on the 
hot utensils. 

To Clean Pewter Wash the article with hot 

water and fine silver sand; then dry and polish 
with a leather. Clean discolored pewter with 
sweet oil and whiting. 

Furred Kettle Clean with sal-soda or sal- 
ammoniac. Fill the kettle with cold water, add 
a little sal-ammoniac, and boil. The fur will dis- 
solve. Rinse the kettle thoroughly and polish dry. 

Burned Pans — Saucepans that have been burned 
should never be filled with soda water, as this 
makes them more liable to burn again the next 
time used. Instead, fill with salt and water, leave 
a few hours, then bring slowly to a boil; the 
burned particles will come off without difficulty. 

Stained Cruet — Fill cruet with finely chopped 
potato skins, cork tightly, let stand in a warm 
place for two or three days; then turn skins out 
and rinse cruet with warm water and borax. 

Chopping Bowl — Remove the odor of food 
from a wooden chopping bowl in boiling water 
in which a little soda is dissolved. A tablespoon 
of soda to a gallon of water. 

Cracked Dishes — If boiled in enough sweet milk 
to cover them for about 45 minutes the cracks 
will glue together and become invisible and the 
dishes will stand almost as much -ordinary usage 
as before. 

Wash Linoleum and Oil Cloth with luke warm 
water, then polish it with a soft woolen cloth 
which has been dipped in milk. Wipe oil cloth 
with skimmed milk; it is almost as beneficial as 
a coat of varnish. Linoleum should have a coat 
of varnish, even two coats, when new, before 
using, and an occasional coat afterwards; it will 
almost entirely prevent wear if applied frequently. 

Under the Oil Stove, try putting oil cloth on 
the shelf below the burners; it can be removed for 
washing, and will prove less trouble than scouring 
the shelf itself and is less mussy than a drip pan 
for this purpose.

A Box of Salt, a large one, should always be 
near the kitchen stove, not alone for its conve- 
nience for cooking, but in case of fat boiling over 
and catching fire; the fire may be instantly put 
out by dashing on a handful of salt. It is almost 
the only good and instant means for smothering 
any sudden flare-up of fire. It takes time to beat 
out a flame by wetting a cloth for the purpose, 
and water is likely to spread fire around a stove 
■where grease or fat catches the flame. A box of 
salt always handy is almost as effective as an 
expensive fire extinguisher. 

Coffee-Grounds, left over, slightly moistened, 
make fine dust-down for sweeping floors; it is 
clean and will not stain. 

Opening Fruit Jars — Instead of prying open 
with a knife, just hold the top (upside down) in 

hot water for a few minutes just dip in the top, 

not the body of the jar — and the lid will come off 
easily without danger of cutting the hands. In 
prying, the tool may slip, or the top of the jar 
itself, giving one a bad cut. 

To Remove Stopper from a bottle without mu- 
tilating it with a corkscre"w, or to remove wooden 
or glass stoppers wrhich stick, cut a narrow strip 
of sandpaper and, holding it tightly around the 
stopper, twist the stopper; the sandpaper gives the 
fingers a "purchase" so they do not slip. A large 
rubber band wound tightly around the stopper 
wrill perform the same function. A v^rider piece 
of sandpaper may be used for unscrewing the 



cover of a fruit jar. The narrow strip is used 
again for a hot water bottle the top of which 
has stuck. 

A Glass Stopper may often be removed by in- 
serting in the crack of a door at the hinged side. 
Close the door as tightly as you can on the stop- 
per without breaking it and then twist the bottle 
gently back and forth. 

Or: hold the bottle firmly by the same means, 
or have an assistant hold it. Take two turns 
around the neck with a heavy, rough, strong 
cord. Holding an end of the cord in each hand, 
pull one end and then the other, causing the cord 
to set up a high friction to the neck of the bottle. 
The heat expands the glass of the neck slightly 
but does not penetrate to the glass stopper so 
rapidly. The stopper is release for easy removal- 
Paraffin the Corks of bottles, set away for a 
time, or for prevention of leakage when packing 
bottles for traveling, either bottles containing 
medicine or any other liquids. Paraffin seals the 
corks or other tops tightly from air and tends to 
preserve contents as well as prevent leakage. 
Simply dip the corked tops into melted paraffin 
and set away to cool. 

Movable Kitchen Table — Put casters on kitchen 
table. It is surprising how often it is convenient 
to move a table around if it moves easily and 
conveniently. A movable table, at times, saves 
lots of steps.

MAKESHIFT KITCHEN APPLIANCES 

The housewife who is ingenious enough to supply a sudden need for a 
certain article from something in no wise intended for the purpose has gone far 
towards solving the question of efficiency. 

The possibilities of cans and boxes is infinite. Take the oval cans in which 
soused mackerel comes; these, if the top is removed or melted off close to the 
side and edges smoothed, make most excellent jelly or pudding moulds, and are 
convenient for many purposes. 

If the double boiler is missing or has sprung a leak, a good substitute will be found 
in a coffee can which is slipped inside the tea kettle. Should it prove a bit too small, 
cut down an inch or two, leaving an inch strip at the seam and another opposite, and it 
is handy for many other purposes for insertion into the kettle — to make paste in or to melt 
glue. 

A tin collar for a stovepipe and a tin pail or other vessel which will fit snugly inside 
it makes an excellent double boiler when set over a pan or kettle of boiling water; and a very 
ideal way to bake potatoes is found in the use of a wire trivet placed on top of the stove 
with a round cake pan turned over it; this does away with the necessity of waiting for the 
oven to heat, for by the time it is hot enough to bake, the potatoes will be more than half 
done. Biscuit may even be baked in this way, and the top of the heating stove may be used 
quite as well as the range. 

When the fire is allowed to die down between meals, a wood or coal fire being 
used, one does not always care to go to the trouble of starting one just for a light evening 
meal, and if a gas or oil stove is not used one may improvise a very good substitute by 
setting a large lamp in a box with one end removed and placing an oven rack across the 
top, a couple of inches over the chimney. On this improvised stove one may boil the tea 
kettle, fry potatoes, poach eggs, and do other little culinary stunts. This will be found invalu- 
able on moving days when the range is not yet set up or the gas turned on. In the summer 
camp it is a find indeed, and with the use of the triple stewpans, which cook three sepa- 
rate things over one burner, a creditable dinner may be evolved by its use. 

A suds dipper which has begun to leak needs only a few more holes punched in 
the bottom to make a superior sink strainer — because of the convenient handle. The lid 
of a workman's dinner pail makes an excellent biscuit cutter, being of about the right size 
for pocketbook rolls, for which the ordinary biscuit cutter is too small. The top from 
a coffee can, if not too large, or some other similar can, makes as good a biscuit cutter as 
can be purchased. The bottom of a colander should not be thrown away, but saved to 
put in the bottom of the kettle under the pot roast to prevent its sticking and scorching. A 
dozen pot lid knobs that can be bought on any five-cent counter are a good investment; they 
will not only replace lost knobs on pot covers, but can be used to convert the tops of tin 
cans into covers for small basins, bowls, pails and the like. The cover of an ordinary 
lard pail when fitted with a knob and punctured makes an excellent cutter for short-cake 
biscuit.

There is an improved lid on the market that should supersede the old fashioned Hd 
entirely— a lid of gray enamel with a handle on the side ending in a hook for hanging 
it up Half a dozen assorted sized lids may be hung on one nail. They can be used 
for other purposes than as lids— to set the hot kettle or pan on when dishing up on the 
table or to lift the meat from the kettle.

WASHING THE DISHES AND CLEANING UTENSILS 

Dish Washing — (Cornell Reading Course) — Apparatus: Dishpan, rinsing pan, drain- 
ing pan and basket, dishcloth, several clean, dry dish towels, boiling water, soap and washing 
soda. 

Put iron pots and pans to soak in strong soda water, also put to soak any cooking 
dishes that need it. Put one inside another so as to clean the outside also. This should 
be done the moment the contents are emptied, and before the meal goes to the table. 

Clean the dining table, and leave the room in order. 

Put the food away, scrape and stack the dishes at the washing end of the table, 
putting to soak any that need it. 

Set out the pans, with the draining basket in the rinsing pan. Half fill the dishpan 
with hot, soapy water, three-quarters fill the rinsing pan with nearly boiling water. 

Wash the glass, dropping each piece gently into the basket. Put flat silver into the 
dishwater to soak. Lift the basket of glass into the draining pan, dry the glass and set it 
aside. Use the softest towels for this and see that the glass is left shining. (If you prefer 
the glass dried out of cold water, use it, and then fill the pan with boiling water.) 

Return the basket to the rinsing pan. Wash, rinse and dry the silver the same as 
the glass. The towels must be dry for the silver. 

Wash, rinse, and dry the small china pieces the same as glass, and put away the 
basket. 

Wash, rinse, and leave the rest of the china and crockery to drain, while the pots 
and pans are being washed. 

Dry the china and crockery, rinse and dry the pots and pans. Scour the steel knives 
and forks. 

Put aw^ay all the dishes. 

Empty the dishpan, put rinsing water in it, wash the other pans, dry with the cloth 
wrung dry, and put them away. 

If the rinsing water is still clean and warm, scrub the table and the sink with it; if 
not, get fresh water. Wash the teakettle, inside and out, once a day, when the w^ater is 
soapy. I 

Put towels and dishcloth to soak in hot, soapy water. This need be done but once 
a day, usually after the midday meal. 

Rub off the stove. Sweep the kitchen floor. Empty the garbage pail. 

Wash the towels and dishcloth. Rinse the pail out with the suds, and dry with the 
cloth wrung dry. Rinse the towels thoroughly in hot water and hang to dry, in fresh air 
if possible. 

Dust the kitchen once a day. 

Note: The dishwater should be kept hot and soapy enough to prevent the forma- 
tion of a grease-ring on the pan, and should be changed when dirty. Keep the rinsing 
water very hot, thus requiring fewer towels.

COOKING HINTS 

In cookery, as in dress, a woman should remember that if she cannot afford 
to employ an artist she should not attempt things which are beyond the powers of 
any but an expert. She who tries to hide the evil cut of her dress with yards of 
trimmings is on a par in lack of taste with the cook who makes wonderful con- 
coctions of pounded chicken elaborately encased in aspic and trimmed with stars 
and stripes and other shapes of tongue, w^hite of egg and truffles, and which 
tastes of nothing but white of egg and truffles. 

It must not be thought, however, that the appearance of food may be 
slighted. It is of great importance — almost as great as the cooking and flavoring. 
No matter how inexpensive the food, it should be nicely served, and no sloven- 
liness should be allowed even in the most simple of family meals. On the other 
hand, the garnishing of the most elaborate dish should never be permitted to mar 
its taste or temperature. To that end, hot dishes must be generally less elaborate 
than cold. 



To Whip Thin Cream — ^Thin creatn, too thin 
to whip properly, will whip better if the white of 
one egg is added, or two whites if there is a 
large amount of the cream. The egg improves 
both the quality and the quantity. 

Whites of Eggs — A teaspoonful of cold water 
added to whites of eggs will cause them to whip 
easily and quickly. 

Pickles may be kept from becoming mouldy by 
laying a little bag of mustard on the top of the 
pickle jar. 

Hashes and Minces are much improved if the 
meat is soaked in the gravy or' sauce some time 
before being reheated. 

Salt That Lumps — Add a little cornstarch to 
the salt before filling. 

Spread Papers over your kitchen table before 
starting to clean poultry, or to make bread or 
pies; they catch waste and save much cleaning up 
later. 

No Tears with Onions — Scalding water poured 
over onions saves "weeps." 

Preserved Provisions, when opened, and only a 
part of the contents removed, should be emptied 
of all at once, and the unused portions put in 
earthen or glass vessels. The air acting upon the 
tin and the solder causes the acid contents to 
dissolve parts of the minerals. 

Lemon Rinds — Save them, dry them in the 
oven and store them in an air tight vessel. A 
little added to apple sauce gives it a delicious 
flavor, and it has other uses for seasoning. 



Use a Soft Brush for brushing bread rolls and 
pastry with melted butter — such a brush as is 
used for varnishing. 

Before Grating Lemons wash them in a basin 
of lukewarm water; the outside of the lemon is 
often not very clean; examine a lemon under a 
microscope and you "will find tiny black spots 
which are the minute eggs of an insect. 

Sugar Syrup — A small quantity of cream of tar- 
tar in it will prevent the syrup becoming granu- 
lated. 

Currant Jelly should be used for game and 
custards and bread puddings. 

Keep on Hand always a quantity of grated 
bread crumbs, grated cheese, good vinegar, herbs 
and spices, as these are indispensable and you 
often want them without warning. 

Mint, either with or without parsley, is served 
with roast lamb, both hot and cold. Dry mint, 
and put it away for future use. 

Save the Sprigs of celery tops and use them 
for salads and cold meats, or dry them and put 
away for the future. 

Cooking Raisins — ^To keep moist, keep in a 
glass fruit jar. 

Cheese — To prevent becoming dry or mouldy, 
wrap in a cloth which has been moistened in 
vinegar. 

Wire Spoon — Use for removing doughnuts 
from hot fat. Other uses suggest themselves if 
you have it.

Lemons can be kept soft much longer if put 
in a jar filled with water, the water being renewed 
every second day. 

Tomatoes and Milk to be blended must be 
brought to the same temperature and beaten to- 
gether vigorously; there is less liability of curd- 
ling. 

A Saucepan in which rice, oatmeal or any- 
thing sticky has been cooked may be very easily 
cleaned by putting in a cupful of ashes and fill 
^vith water when you take it off the fire. 

Sugar Used in Pie — Put the sugar always in the 
centre of the fruit, not at the top, as this makes 
the paste sodden. 

Overheated Oven — Put a bowl of cool water in- 
side to cool it. 

Burnt Milk — Take the pan off the fire and 
stand it at once in a basin of cold water. Put a 
pinch of salt in the pan, give the milk a stir, and 
you will find that the burnt taste has almost if 
not quite disappeared. 

After Eating Onions — Coffee beans, cloves, 
sugar or parsley moistened with sugar will prevent 
the onions from being noticeable on the breath. 

Substitute (or Maple Sugar — Equal parts of 
granulated white and dark brown sugar, with one- 
half the quantity of water added, and boiled until 
of desired thickness. When cold, add three drops 
of vanilla extract. Much of the cheap "niaple- 
ized" sugar you buy is only the above with per- 
haps a few drops of maple syrup to further flavor. 



Wooden Spoon should be used for stirring in 
preference to an iron one; the latter will often 
scratch tin or cause discoloration in the food; 
the acid in the food working on the metal will 
do the latter. 

Odors — When cooking anything which has a 
strong odor put a small pan of vinegar in the 
stove and there will be no scent of cooking in 
the air. 

Soggy Bread or Pastry — When serving hot bread 
or pastry, use hot plates; the most delicious be- 
come soggy when served on cold plates. 

Cream Pitcher Cream may be prevented from 

dripping from the spout by rubbing the inside of 
the spout with a little butter. 

Soak Nuts in hot water for an hour or two 
and they will crack easier and the meats come 
out whole with less trouble to pick. 

To Open Cocoanut — Place it first in the oven 
for a few minutes; the warmth makes opening 
easier. 

Cracker Dust — Always keep a jar of cracker 
dust on hand for breading unless you have no 
bread crumbs for the purpose. 

Dates or Figs — When running these through the 
mincing machine add a fe^v drops of lemon juice 
to prevent the fruit from clogging. 

Cutting Hot or Brown Bread — Use a silk or linen 
thread or fine virire instead of a knife and the 
bread will crumble less.

LEFT-OVER FOODS 

(Iowa State College of Agriculture) 

"WASTE NOT, WANT NOT" 

The American housekeeper has had an unenviable reputation as a careless buyer, a 
thoughtless manager and a reckless waster of foods. In no other way has this been more 
apparent than in the custom in many homes to throw away bits of leftover food materials 
w^hich might be put to good use. Much more credit is due to the woman who, as far as 
possible prevents the accumulation of leftovers, but who uses them wisely as they are found, 
than to the woman who cooks fresh food attractively and well, but who throws away foods 
which still contain food value and which might form the basis of palatable dishes. 



LEFTOVERS AND SOME USES 

Bread — 

White, graham, whole wheat, corn, rye. 

Toast. 

Biscuit. 

Pancake or waffle batter. 
Meat and Eggs — 

Beef, pork, ham, bacon, chicken, fish; eggs 

boiled, fried or scrambled. 

Gravy. 
Vegetables — 

String beans, onions, potatoes, beans, peas, 

corn. 
Cereals — 

Rice, macaroni, oatmeal, cornmeal, cream of 

wheat, hominy. 
Fruit Sauces — 

Apple, prune, rhubarb, cranberry, etc. 
Fats — 

Suet, bacon fat, meat fryings, chicken fat, 

butter. 

Prevent Leftovers (When Possible) 

1. By Careful Planning — Do not serve too 
many kinds of food at each meal. Provide variety 
between meals. Do not cook too great an amount 
of each food. 

2. By Careful Serving — Do not serve too gen- 
erously. It is better to have a second helping in 
reserve, so that if not eaten it may be used later. 

Use Leftovers (When at Hand) 
1. Practice Economy — True not False — Other 
things than money should be considered in prac- 
ticing economy. The fuel to be used; the time 
to be spent; the food value to be saved and the 
additions that must be made should all be taken 
into account. Use good judgment in the selec- 
tion of leftovers to be used. 



2. Consider Appearance — More skill is needed 
to make leftover dishes attractive than the fresh 
foods. The wise housekeeper ■will remember this 
and make her leftover dishes as attractive in ap- 
pearance as she can. 

3. Prevent Monotony — Practice making many 
different leftover dishes. The family will soon 
tire of the same food cooked in the same way 
many times. 

4. Provide Flavor — Remember that many left- 
over foods, particularly meats, have lost their 
original flavor and must be made tempting if they 
are to prove popular with the family in the made- 
over dish. This does not mean that extravagant 
flavorings must be used, however. Select the 
highly flavored vegetables, as well as the standard 
seasonings.

PLAIN PATTERNS IN COOKERY 

(Iowa State College of Agriculture) 

Many housewives, especially those who have had little experience in cook- 
ing, are dependent upon the cook book to such a degree that they are unable to 
prepare a dish without it. It is unfortunate that this is true, for often much time 
and effort are spent searching for certain recipes which are not at all difficult if 
the fundamental principles are understood. TTiere are certain underlying prin- 
ciples which govern all recipes. These principles may be worked out in a system 
of plain patterns which may form the basis of much of the cooking. 



PLAIN PATTERNS 

1. CUSTARDS 

2. SAUCES 

3. TIMBALES 

4. SOUFFLES 

5. SOFT DOUGHS 

CUSTARDS 

Custard Pattern — 2 cups scalded milk, 2 or 3 
C8S* (according to size), l/g teasp. salt. 
Beat eggs slightly, add salt and hot milk. 

Soft Custard — Custard pattern, J4 c"P »ugar, 
Yl teasp. vanilla. 

Add sugar to custard pattern and cook in a

CLASS 1 

Soup should be a frequent indulgence in every dietary. Cream soups and 
purees are most appetizing and nutritious. Clear soups are excellent stimulants 
to appetite and are hardly equalled in food value. All soups well made are easy 
of full assimilation. 

Soups are made with and without meat stocks. 

MEAT STOCK SOUPS ARE: 
BouOlon — from lean beef, clear and seasoned. Clam bouillon is an exception. 
Consomme — from two or more kinds of meat, seasoned with vegetables and other- 
wise; usually clear. 

Brown Soup — from lean beef browned and seasoned. 

NON-MEAT STOCK SOUPS ARE: 
Puree — vrith the pulp of cooked vegetables added to milk or cream. Milk is thick- 
ened with cornstarch or flour; stock sometimes added. 

Cream Soup — made thinner than puree — of vegetables or fish, with milk, or some 
cream, or both, and seasoned ; thickened to taste. 



The Economical Stock-pot — It may seem easy to put a bone into some water and let 
it boil hard for several hours. But the result is not apt to be the most flavorful and 
nutritious soup. In making all of the stock soups, the meat, bones, etc., should be put into 
cold water to which salt has been added, and allowed to come to a boil very slowly, so as 
to extract the juices before the tissues become toughened. At no time is it necessary to 
boil furiously. Indeed, the word "simmer" is peculiarly expressive for soups. 

Meat Soups are made from scraps, left-overs, bones, trimmings, from steak or roasts, 
or from cheap cuts bought for the purpose, such as shins, neck or shoulder cuts, or lower 
round cuts. The tougher parts are richer in the extracts and in soluble albumen. 

Use a porcelain or granite kettle, cover tight-fitting, and strainer, colendar fine sieve 
and strainer. A good fireless cooker is most excellent. 

To Make Plain Soup Stock — Clean the meat, wiping with dry or damp cloth, sepa- 
rate the bone and fat. Cut meat into small pieces, place in kettle with one teaspoonful salt 
to quart of water. Cook at low temperature six or seven hours. Add other seasoning last 
half-hour. 

Do not remove scum until just before serving, as the scum contains nutritive ele- 
ments; some prefer the scum not removed. 

A layer of fat forms: do not remove this until stock is used, as it protects by 
excluding the air. Save the fat, when removed, for drippings.

1 1 8 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Sec. IV— Pt. 2— COOKING AND RECIPES 

Clear the soup with white and shell of one egg to each quart stock. Break and 
beat together, add to the stock, set on fire, stir to boiling point, boil two or three minutes, 
skim, strain and serve. Add more seasoning, if desired, before clearing. Strain through 
filter paper for perfect clearness. 

Thicken soup with wheat or rice or leftover cereal, flour or cornstarch, mixed with 
cold water or milk to smooth paste, more liquid then added until thin: cook 15 minutes 
after thickening. 

If butter is added, melt until bubbling, then stir in a little flour; add gradually a cup 
of hot soup, cook, thicken, stir it into the soup; cook the soup then 15 minutes. Bread, 
dried and browned, and added to a cup of stock, may be used instead of flour; simmer until 
soft, crush and dilute with soup % cup dried bread to I quart finished soup. Use wheat or rye 
bread as preferred. 

Glace is clear stock boiled down to about a fourth of original amount; to almost a 
glue state; will keep for weeks, in a close jar in cool place. Use for enriching a weak stock, 
for gravy, for browning meats, or to add to sauce. 

Vegetable Stock — the w^ater in which vegetables have been cooked. It is rich in salts 
and flavors. Water from cooked macaroni, barley and rice should be retained for soups. 

Seasoning for Soups — Keep on hand: dried celery or celery roots; sweet herbs, 
thyme, parsley, savory, celery salt or celery seed, marjoram; spices, cloves, stick cinneunon, 
allspice, whole pepper. Arrowroot, sago, tapioca, barley, rice, bread, eggs, cornstarch, flour 
are added to give flavor as well as for nourishment and thickening. 

The Basis for Cream Soups — The cream soups may seem at first more difficult, but 
a little practice will show that a cream soup is one of the easiest to prepare. The basis is a 
thin, white sauce in about the following proportions: 1 tbsp. of butter, I tbsp. of flour, 1 cup- 
ful of milk or cream and J/^ teasp. each of salt and white pepper. 

To this can be added from Yl to 1 cupful of pulp of any kind of vegetables or fish, 
or water in which vegetables have been cooked, with 1 tbsp. flour for each cup of liquid 
added. In most cases it is necessary to cook the vegetables separately wth water, as car- 
rots, dried peas, lentils, corn, etc. The mixture is poured through a strainer by using a 
w^ooden pestle or masher. 

The resulting pulp is added to the above cream mixture. 

As a general rule, the food should not cook after the puree has been added, only 
heated through and served at once. Puree should be neither thick and cloying, nor dis- 
agreeably thin, because the puree and the milk have not been sufficiently blended. The ideal 
puree is of the consistency of a thick cream very w^ell blended. 

Save the stale pieces of bread frequently thrown out. Cut into slices or julienne 
strips, brush with butter and brown in the oven, or saute in a skillet, then serve floating in 
the soup. Whipped cream also brings up the fat and makes a pleasing garnish. 

Pimento gives a piquant touch to a plain cream puree. A delicious cream soup is 
made of corn and served with buttered pop- corn kernels floating on top. 

Grated egg yolk is another attractive garnish. In fact, the cream soup offers 
endless possibilities. In our search for nourishing food at low^ cost, all soup should find a 
larger place.

SOUP RECIPES 



Soups The foundation of all soups is either 

meat stock made from beef, veal, chicken, etc., 
or vegetable stock, or milk. 

Plain Soup Stock — I lb. each of lean beef and 
veal cut in cubes, 2 lbs. cracked marrow bones. 
Cover with cold water and bring slowly to scald- 
ing point. Close the pot; simmer several hours. 
The last hour add stalks of celery, a turnip, car- 
rot, onion, salt, pepper. After cooling stock skim 
off fat, strain and clear according to previous 
directions. 

Many varieties of soups and broths may be 
founded upon this stock. 

Brown Stock — Brown in drippings, 1 lb. beef 
cut small, add 2 lbs. raw beef and bones. Cover 
with cold v^rater. Proceed as with Plain Stock. 

White Stock Use either chicken cut up or 

veal. Make as for Plain Stock, adding a lighter 
seasoning, such as celery, few grains paprika, salt, 
chopped parsley. Cojl, remove all fat, strain and 
clear. This is a delicate stock foundation for 
soup for young children or convalescents. 

A dinner soup preceding a heavy meal should 
be light, clear, hot, and served with bread, or 
breadsticks. 

Bouillon (A Clear Soup) — Allow I pt. of water 
to each lb. beef and bone. Cut up meat; cover 
with cold water and let stand I hour. Heat gradu- 
ally to boiling; simmer several hours until all 
strength is out of meat. Season with salt and 
pepper. Also celery and onion if desired. Cool 
until grease rises and hardens, skim, strain and 
clear. Serve very hot. 

Chicken Bouillon Cut up a 4-lb. fowl. Cover 

with 4 qts. cold water; bring slo^vly to a boil. 
Simmer until meat falls from bones. Last ^/i hour 
season lightly with celery salt, pepper, onion 
juice. Cool, remove fat, strain out bones and 
meat, clear, serve hot. 

Queen of Hearts Bouillon — Boil 2 doz. chopped 
oysters in I pt. cold water, 5 minutes. Strain, 
season to taste. Just before serving, drop tiny 
heart-shaped pieces of pimientoes into each cup 
of bouillon. Serve with bread cut into small 
heart^hapes, toasted. 

Jellied Bouillon To I qt. boiling hot beef or 

chicken stock add 1 tbsp. granulated gelatine 
softened in Yi cup cold water. Strain into bouillon 
cups. Serve ice cold. Garnish each portion with 
chopped parsley sprinkled over I teasp. of whipped 
cream. 

Bouillon Cubes — When it is inconvenient, be- 
cause of lack of time or materials, to make meat 
or vegetable stock, the modern housewife can use 
the compressed meat and vegetable cubes now on 
the market. They may be used plain with boiling 
water for bouillons or as a foundation for heavier 
soups. 



Consomme (Clear Soup) — Brown 3 lbs. diced 
lean beef in suet with '/2 sliced onion. Cover 
with 2 qts. cold water, simmer in closed pot sev- 
eral hours. Add I carrot, turnip, celery, 2 cloves, 
parsley. Cook 1 hour longer. Strain, cool, skim 
off fat. Reheat to boiling. Stir in white of I egg 
beaten in 2 tbsp. cold water. Remove from fire,

rice, or barley previously soaked 1 2 hours. Cook 
until cereal is done.

all. Simmer about 3 hours. Remove bro\vned 
meat to be served with soup. Continue cooking 
until remainder falls from bones. Strain, cool, 
skim off cold fat. If flavoring is not satisfactory, 
add more salt and pepper or some brown stock, 
or reheat for 20 minutes with minced vegetables 
as onion, carrot, turnip, celery. 

Julienne (A Clear Soup with Shredded Vege- 
tables) Use I pt. of such vegetables as may be 

convenient or even leftovers, as peas, string 
beans, or asparagus, onion, celery, turnip, carrot, 
cabbage. Cut them into small fancy shapes, boil 
in salted water until tender. Add 1 qt. strong 
soup stock. Cook gently 1 5 minutes. Before 
serving, add chopped parsley to taste and boil up 
once. 

Thickened Soups — Soups which form an entire 
meal or precede a light lunch should be of a 
nutritious character rather than mainly stimulat- 
ing, as are clear soups. 

Chicken Bisque (Stock Thickened with Minced 
Meat and Crumbs) — Cut up 1 chicken. Simmer 
in cold water as for Plain Stock, adding minced 
onion and celery. Remove bones, when cold chop

THE TERM MEAT is the name given to the flesh of all animals that is 
used for food. Meat is principally albuminoids, fats, mineral matter, and water. 
Albumen makes blood and muscle. It dissolves in cold wrater and coagulates by 
the application of heat, beginning to coagulate at 1 35 degrees Fahrenheit and 
solidifying at 160 degrees. Meat, therefore, should be cooked in water below the 
boiling point, and in boiling and roasting a high temperature used to quickly 
harden the surface so that the juices are retained. 

Remove meat from paper as soon as it comes; wipe with a damp cloth 
and place in a cool, clean place. See that it is uniform in color, and firm and 
elastic. Select beef with cream colored fat, avoid the dark yellow fat, which indi- 
cates an old animal. 

The tender cuts of meat are most expensive; the cheaper cuts, not in so 
high demand, are the most highly flavored and most nutritious, but require more 
care and more time in properly cooking. 



COOKING METHODS 

Roasting — The meat should rest about an inch from the bottom of the pan, on 
roasting rack. To prepare rub the meat with salt and pepper, and dredge with flour for 
dry surface. If meat is very lean its flavor is improved by placing over the surface thin 
slices of fat meat, its own fat, or bacon or pork, leaving it there until there are sufficient 
drippings in which to baste the joint, an equal amount of water being added to the bast- 
ing drippings. When done, remove to hot platter, draining off the fat, then add sufficient 
water to dissolve the glaze in the pan. This makes the gravy, which may be thickened 
with brown roux or served "au jus." 

The time varies, but this method is the same for all roasted meats. 

Broiling means cooking by direct exposure over flame or coals. First sear the sur- 
face by exposing to intense heat at once; this retains the juices. The exposure is then 
reduced somewhat to secure thorough cooking without scorching the exterior. 

Pan-Broiling — A steel or iron frying pan is highly heated, then rubbed with fat 
meat until well greased. The meat is seasoned and laid in pan only long enough to sear 
well on under side, then turned to sear the other side, continuing the turning to retain the 
juices, reducing the heat, to cook more slowly until done. 

Braising — This is sometimes confused with roasting, but is essentially different if 
done correctly. It is especially suitable for tough cuts or those lacking in flavor. 

Use a deep pan with close cover. These are frequently sold as roasters when only in 
reality braising pans. The parts fit together tightly to confine the steam and the meat is 
cooked thus: in its own vapor. The toughest cuts may be cooked as tender as veal. 
Lemon juice is an excellent addition, and improves the gravy left in the pan. 

123 



1 24 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Sec. IV— Pt. 2— COOKING AND RECIPES 



Braising permits laying the meats on a bed of vegetables or herbs, the juices of 
which add to the flavor, the whole making a most appetizing, satisfying combination to 
the palate. 

Very dry meats, braised, may be improved by "daubing." Ordinary cuts will cook 
well in their steam alone, especially with the lemon juice, or some vegetables. 

Sauteing — To cook in shallow, hot pan with a little fat, browning alternately on 
one side and the other. 

Frying — To cook in hot fat deep enough to entirely cover the meat. 

Dipping Mixtures — If meat mixtures do not contain eggs, dip in crumbs and egg, 
for a surface to prevent the food from absorbing fat in frying. The albumen of the egg 
hardens and forms a protecting coat. 

Bofling — FoIlo^v the principle of high heat at first until a layer of albumen hardens 
to retain the meat juices; then drop temperature to a simmer and cook very slowly until 
the tissues are almost ready to fall apart. Cool partly in the liquor; serve on very hot plates. 

For Larding — Use salt pork fat, shaving off the rind; cut the fat into quarter-inch 
strips and cut these into quarter-inch strips the other way. Draw these strips into the meat 
with a larding needle, evenly and in alternate rows, until entire upper surface is covered. 

Daubing — This refers to the process of forcing the large lardings through the meat 
from one surface to the other. 

Never Wash Beef — Scrape, if necessary, or wipe with damp cloth, but never put in 
the water; keep it in a cool place, but not directly on the ice; obviously this means the lower 
part of the refrigerator.

MUTTON OR VEAL 
As Shown in This Diagram, the Cuts of Mutton or Veal Are Fewer Than 
Those of Beef, But It Is None the Less Important to the Buyer of 
Meats to Be Thoroughly Familiar with Them. 



CHOOSING MEATS 
LEARNING THE CUTS 

In selecting beef for roasts or steaks see that the lean is firm and red and 
that the meat is finely grained. The fat should be firm and white. Never ac- 
cept any meat which looks flabby or discolored or on w^hich the fat is yellow. In 
choosing mutton the meat should be dark with plenty of fat in it. Meat without 
fat shows poorly fed stock. If the fat is yellow and the meat looks wet or moist 
do not accept it. As a general rule, all meat should be firm, never flabby. Lamb 
and Veal should both be light-colored- — pale. Veal, in fact, cannot be too white. 

BEEF CUTS 

The question of cuts is largely one of preparation and cooking. In food value there 
is no such thing as good, better, or best cuts. The palate or neck contain as much nourish- 
ment as porterhouse steak; the difference is merely texture and flavor — and the so-called 
tender, and expensive cuts, which have the desirable texture without much cooking, as a rule 
do not have as fine flavor as the so-called tough cuts have when properly dealt w^ith. 

The problem is only one of making the cheaper cuts come out without losing their 
inherent flavor by bad cooking methods, such as letting their juices escape and doing them 
thereby to an insipidity merely because they have to be cooked for a longer time. 

In buying, learn the following simple facts: Beef is divided into two sides, and these 
again into fore and hind quarters. 

The Ribs are on the forequarters. The first seven are called the prime ribs, the 
others the chuck ribs. The prime ribs are divided into the first cut, the best, three ribs; 
the second, two ribs; the third, two. 

The ribs are usually roasted, the ribs left in or the roast rolled. The meat is more 
juicy with ribs left in. If removed, remember they are weighed in before removed and 
you therefore pay for them and they are yours. Have the bones cracked, then take them 
along, cook slowly in a little water and you have broth for soups or for flavoring uses. 

The Neck is tough but very nutritious and very sweet meat; it is generally used for 
stew or mince meat. The palate is used in the same way, contains more fat and is less tough. 
With the brisket and the navel it is used for corned beef. 

The Shoulder has two cuts, known as the cross rib and the shoulder clod. They are 
tough, but free from bone and of good flavor. They make most excellent pot roast. They 
need long, slow cooking. 

The Hind Quarter — The best part is the sirloin or prime steaks, ■which is the por- 
tion between the rump and the ribs. 

Porterhouse — That between the last rib and the hip bone is called the porterhouse. 
Inside the bone the tenderloin is found. This is called "T" bone steaks when removed be- 
fore being cut — from the shape of the bone. 

The Sirloin Proper is divided into three parts: the hip bone, which is nearest the 
porterhouse; the flat bone, which is next, and is very good if you can cajole the butcher 
not to sell you all bone; and the round bone, nearest the rump. 

The Rump is in two parts, the top and lower. These are used for roasts; also the 
top sirloin, which lies below^ the sirloin steaks proper. 



CLASS 2— MEATS— CHOOSING MEATS 127 

The Leg — The upper part is called the round, the first two cuts of which, above the 
bone, are very tender. Below the joint it is called the shank, and is used principally for soups. 
The Best Beef comes from corn-fed steers of about three years age. 

VEAL, MUTTON, LAMB, PORK 
AND 

MISCELLANEOUS 

Veal quality depends upon age. Calves six to ten weeks old are best. Under six 
weeks veal is not good food; it is known as "bob-veal." In many states the law forbids the 
sale of veal under four weeks old, but does not always prohibit it successfully. It has a blu- 
ish tint and the muscles are soft and undeveloped. Meat is sold as veal from calves up 
to one year old. 

Veal should be white and pink, with firm grain and much white fat; the fat cannot 
be too white. 

The cuts run as in beef. The top round is usually called fricandeau of veal, it is 
generally roasted. The leg and shoulder are boned and roasted. 

Mutton, if not carefully dressed, may be materially affected in flavor, due to cer- 
tain oil in the skin which if carelessly removed gives the meat a disagreeable, strong taste. 

English mutton has smaller bones to larger proportions of meat; mutton at best has a 
large relative weight of bone to muscle. 

The meat should be fine grained, red and juicy, the fat white and firm, and thick 
on the legs and back. 

The Saddle — If not divided down the back, the ribs and loin together is called the 
short saddle. The long saddle takes in the back entirely to the tail, which is left on. 

The Haunch is the hindquarter taken as a whole. 

Lamb is in Season May to November. Lamb sold in winter is undersized mutton, 
and is tough and dry — or is from the cold storage house. 

Pork — Pork should be pink, the fat firm and white, although the fat may become 
pink after salt is applied. 

Diseased pork has a dull appearance and shows yellow lumps here and there 
in the flesh. 

Summer Fresh Pork is undesirable. It should be prohibited from May 1st until 
December 1st, or later. 

Poultry — This is treated so fully under Poultry Recipes Department that it "begs 
to be excused" under this general talk on Meats in this section. 

Meat Trimmings — These belong to the purchaser — they are paid for — the meat is 
invariably weighed before the butcher asks if he shall trim or dress it for you. 

The Feet of fowls contain gelatine and other valuable additions to gravies and soups. 
Those of calves, hogs and sheep make soups or jellies, or can be boiled, pickeled, fried 
in butter or stewed, or with parts of the head make scrapple. The heads of calves and pigs 
make head cheese. 

The Livers of pigs, poultry, calves, beef, sheep, are all excellent, except perhaps that 
of beef is lacking in delicacy. Liver should be free from streaks or lumps and smooth 
in appearance. Lambs' liver is more toothsome and delicate, by the way, than calves' 
liver, and costs less.

PRINCIPLES OF COOKERY OF MEATS 

1. Heal Harden* Protein — Sear meat to retain 
juices. Cook slowly to make tender. Extract albu- 
men by soaking in cold water. 

2. Heat Decomposet Fat — Cook fats at a low 
temperature (bacon, pork chops). Remove fat 
from pan as fast as it fries out of the meat. 

Method* of Cooking Meats 

1. To extract the juices, as in soups, broths and 
beef teas. 

2. To retain the juices, as in broiling, roasting, 
boiling and frying. 

3. Combination of both, as in stewing and 
braising where part of the juices are retained and 
part extracted. 

Beef tea, beef juice and beef extract are some 
of the products made from beef, having more or 
less food value, according to the method of prep- 
aration. Beef juice is the fluid portion of the 
muscle fiber, obtained by pressure, usually, and 
may be concentrated by evaporation at a tem- 
perature below the coagulating point of the soluble 
proteins. 

Meat extract is made by extracting the juice 
of meat by boiling water and then concentrating 
by evaporation. Beef extract was at one time 
highly recommended by Liebig, who said it had 
great nutritive value because it contained much 
nitrogen in a form readily absorbed from the 



digestive tract. Later he said: "It does not give 
us strength, but makes us aware of our strength." 
In other words, it is a stimulant rather than having 
any great food value. Sherman tells of a series 
of experiments performed by Grindley, and says 
that never were they able to obtain more than 
1 3 per cent, of the true protein of the meat in 
the broth, even when made under very careful 
conditions, and the average was only 7 per cent.

ECONOMICAL USE OF MEAT IN THE HOME 

From Farmers* Bulletin 391, U. S. Department of Agriculture (Extracts) 

Value of Meat as Food — Considering the fact that meat forms an impor- 
tant part of the diet, and the further fact that the price of meat, as of other foods, has 
advanced in recent years, it is natural for housekeepers to seek more economical 
methods of preparing meat for the table, and to turn their thoughts toward the 
less expensive cuts and ask what economy is involved in their use, how they 
may be prepared, and whether the less expensive dishes are as nutritious and as 
thoroughly and easily digested as the costlier ones. 

The value of meat as food depends chiefly on the presence of two classes of nutrients: 
( 1 ) Protein or nitrogenous compounds, and ( 2 ) fat. The mineral matter it contains, par- 
ticularly the phosphorus compounds, is also of much importance, though it is small in quan- 
tity. Protein is essential for the construction and maintenance of the body, and both protein 
and fat yield energy for muscular power and for keeping up the temperature of the body. 
Fat is especially important as a source of energy. It is possible to combine the fat and pro- 
tein of animal foods so as to meet the requirements of the body with such materials only, 
and this is done in the Arctic regions, where vegetable food is lacking; but it is in gen- 
erally considered that diet is better and more wholesome when, in addition to animal foods, 
such as meat, which is rich in proteins and fats, it contains vegetable foods, w^hich are richest 
in sugar, starch and other carbohydrates. Both animal and vegetable foods supply the 
mineral substances which are essential to bodily grow^th and development. In meat min- 
eral matter constitutes about 0.3 to 1.9 per cent on an average of the total fresh material. 

The difference between cuts is chiefly in the amount of the fat and consequently 
in the fuel value. So far as the proteins are concerned, i. e., the substances w^hich build and 
repair the important tissues of the body, very little difference is found. For all practical 
every-day purposes it may be considered that the protein obtained from a given weight of 
meat differs very little either with the kind of meat or the cut. The fattest portions of 
pork, which are used for salt pork or cured pork and bacon, are exceptions, and in such cuts 
the proteins may be as low^ as 8 or 9 per cent. 



APPARENT AND ACTUAL COST OF MEAT IN DIFFERENT CUTS 

The relative retail prices of the various cuts usually bear a direct relation to the 
favor with which they are regarded by the majority of persons, the juicy tender cuts of good 
flavor selling for the higher prices. When porterhouse steak sells for 25 cents a pound, it 
may be assumed that round steak would ordinarily sell for about 1 5 cents, and chuck ribs, 
one of the best cuts of the forequarter, for I cents. This makes it appear that the chuck 
ribs are less than half as expensive as porterhouse steak and two-thirds as expensive as the 
round. But apparent economy is not always real economy, and in this case the bones in the 
three cuts should be taken into account. Of the chuck ribs, more than one-half is bone or 
other materials usually classed under the head of "waste" or "refuse." Of the round, one- 
twelfth is waste, and of the porterhouse one-eighth. In buying the chuck, then, the house- 
wife gets, at the prices assumed, less than one-half pound of food for ten cents, making the 
net price of the edible portion 22 cents a pound; in buying round, she gets eleven-twelfths 
of a pound for fifteen cents, making the net value about 161/2 cents; in buying porterhouse, 
she gets seven-eighths of a pound for 25 cents, making the net value about 26 Yz cents a 

130 



CLASS 2— MEATS— ECONOMICAL USE 131 

pound. The relative prices, therefore, of the edible portions are 22, 1 6J/2, and 28'/2 cents; 
or, to put it in a different way, a dollar at the prices assumed will buy AYl pounds of solid 
meat from the cut known as chuck, 6 pounds of such meat from the round and only "iYl 
pounds of such meat from the porterhouse. To this should be added the fact that because 
of the way in which porterhouse is usually cooked no nutriment is obtained from the bone, 
while by the long, slow process by which the cheaper cuts, except when they are broiled or 
fried, are prepared the gelatin, fat and flavoring material of the bone are extracted. The 
bones of meats that are cooked in water, therefore, are in a sense not all refuse, for they con- 
tain some food wrhich may be secured by proper cookery. 

it is true, of course, that the bones of steaks may be used for soup-making, and that 
the nourishment may thus be utilized, but this must be done by a separate process from 
that of cooking the steak itself. 

LESSENING THE AMOUNT OF MEAT USED. 

In many American families meat is eaten two or three times a day; in such cases the 
simplest way of reducing the meat bill would very likely be to cut down the amount used, 
either by serving it less often or by using less at a time. Deficiency of protein need not be 
feared when one good meat dish a day is served, especially if such nitrogenous materials as 
eggs, milk, cheese and beans are used instead. In localities where fish can be obtained 
fresh and cheap, it might well be more cheaply substituted for meat for the sake of variety 
as well as economy. Ingenious cooks have many ways of "extending the flavor" of meat, 
that is, of combining a small quantity with other materials to make a large dish, as in meat 
pies, stews and similar dishes. 

THE FAT, BONE AND TRIMMINGS IN MEAT, AND THE LEFT-OVER COLD MEATS 

in the percentage of the fat present in different kinds and cuts of meat, a greater 
difference exists than in the percentage of proteins. If the fat of the meat is not eaten at 
the table, and is not utilized otherwise, a pecuniary loss results. If butter is the fat used in 
making crusts for meat pies, and in preparing the cheaper cuts, there is little economy in- 
volved ; the fats from other meat should therefore be saved, as they may be used in place 
of butter in such cases, as well as in preparing many other foods. TTie fat from sausage 
or from the soup kettle, or from a pot roast, which is savory because it has been cooked w^ith 
vegetables, is particularly acceptable. Sometimes savory vegetables, onion, or sweet herbs 
are added to fat when it is tried out to give it flavor. 

Some illustrations of methods of preparing such cooking fats foUow^: 

Trying-Out Fat — A double boiler is the best utensil to use in trying-out small por- 
tions of fat. There is no danger of burning the fat and the odor is much less noticeable than 
if it is heated in a dish set directly over the fire. I 

Clarifying Fat. — Excepting where the purpose of clarifying fat is to remove flavor, a 
good method to follow is to pour boiling water over the fat, to boil thoroughly, and then to 
set it away to cool. The cold fat may be removed in a solid cake and any impurities cling- 
ing to it may be scraped off, as they will be found at the bottom of the layer. By repeating 
this process two or three times a cake of clean, white fat may be obtained. 

A slight burned taste or similar objectionable flavor often can be removed from fat 
by means of potatoes. After melting the fat, put into it thick slices of raw potatoes; heat 
gradually. When the fat ceases to bubble and the potatoes are brown, strain through a 
cloth placed in a wire strainer. 



1 32 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK-^ec. IV— Pt. 2— COOKING AND RECIPES 

Savory Drippings — When rendering the drippings of fat meat, add a small onion (do 
not cut it), a few leaves of summer savory and thyme, a teaspoonful of salt, and a little 
pepper. This is enough for a pint of fat. Keep the drippings covered and in a cool place. 

Uses for Bones — Almost any meat bones can be used in soup making, and if the 
meat is not all removed from them the soup is better. But some bones, especially the rib 
bones, if they have a little meat left on them, can be grilled or roasted into very palat- 
able dishes. The "sparerib" of Southern cooks is made of the rib bones from a roast of 
pork, and makes a favorite dish when well browned. The braised ribs of beef often served 
in high-class restaurants are made from the bones cut from rib rocists. In this connection 
it may be noted that many of the dishes popular in good hotels are made of portions of 
meat such as are frequently thrown away in private houses, but which with proper cooking 
and seasoning make attractive dishes and give most acceptable variety to the menu. An 
old recipe for "broiled bones" directs that the bones (beef ribs or sirloin bones on which 
the meat is not left too thick in any part) be sprinkled with salt and pepper (Cayenne), and 
broiled over a clear fire until browned. Another example of the use of bones is boiled mar- 
row bone. The bones are cut in convenient lengths, the ends covered with a little piece of 
dough over which a floured cloth is tied, and cooked in boiling water for two hours. After 
removing the cloth and dough, the bones are placed upright on toast and served. Pre- 
pared as above, the bones may also be baked in a deep dish. Marrow is sometimes re- 
moved from bones after cooking, seasoned, and served on toast. 

Trimmings from meat may be utilized in various "made dishes," or they can always 
be put to good use in the soup kettle. It is surprising how many economies may be practiced 
in such ways and also in the table use of left-over portions of cooked meat if attention is 
given to the matter. 

METHODS OF EXTENDING THE FLAVOR OF MEAT 

Common household methods of extending the meat flavor through a considerable 
quantity of material which would otherwise be lacking in distinctive taste are to serve the 
meat with dumplings, generally in the dish with it, to combine the meat with crusts, as in 
meat pies or meat rolls, or to serve the meat on toast and biscuits. Borders of rice, 
hominy, or mashed potatoes axe examples of the same principles applied in different ways. 
By serving some preparation of flour, rice, hominy, or other food rich in starch with the 
meat we get a dbh which in itself approaches nearer to the balanced ration than meat 
alone, and one in which the meat flavor is extended through a large cunount of the material. 



IN PLACE OF MEAT 

You Elat in Order to Keep Yourself Alive 

(Reprint from publication, "Substitutes for Meat," issued by Mayor Mitchell's Committee 

on Food Supply, New York) 

The work you do, the exercise you take, the thoughts you think, each 
breath you draw — all these use up a certain portion of your body each day. If 
you want to live and keep well, this used up portion must be replaced, and this 
is done through the food you eat. Part of your food furnishes you with new 
blood; part of it goes to make bone; part of it builds up new tissue, or flesh. 

Meat has always been considered the best tissue or flesh building food, 
and for this reason people have always eaten it a great deal. Most of our meat 
has come from the Western States, but the tremendously large ranches of twenty 
years ago are greatly being cut up into small farms and cattle are not being raised 
in such large numbers any more, and this is one reason why meat costs so much. 
Another reason is the great demand there is for it on the part of the people who 
do not know that there are other foods that will supply the needs of the body in 
just the same way that meat does and which do not cost as much as meat. For 
instance, we can use fish in place of meat much more than we do. 

Other foods that can take the place of meat are eggs, milk, creamed soups, macaroni, 
cheese, cereals, nuts, bananas, peas, beans and lentils. 

Eggs contain all the elements, in the right proportion, necessary for the support of 
the body. They are rich in the same flesh-building element as the lean of meat and therefore 
make an excellent substitute for meat. They should be eaten with foods that are rich in 
starch, such as bread and potatoes, and if so eaten they will take care of the body practi- 
cally as meat would. 

Milk contains heat giving, strength giving and tissue building properties. Creamed 
soups and purees made with milk and the pulp of vegetables can take the place of meat. 

Macaroni, Spaghetti and noodles contain so much starch and flesh building material 
that they are equal to meat as a food if combined with cheese. The fat that they lack is 
supplied by the cheese, and when so combined they make a perfect food. 

Cheese contains in a condensed form the same flesh building material as meat and 
can be used in place of it. If combined with macaroni, rice, etc., it will supply all the needs 
of the body. Cheese costs less than most cuts of meat and a given amount of money will 
buy twice as much food value if spent for cheese as it will if spent for beef. 

Cereals contain in varying proportions all the elements necessary to support life. 
They contain a great deal of starch, which is valuable as a strength giver. Oatmeal and corn- 
meal contain more fat than the other cereals and therefore make a good winter food, especially 
for hard-working people. Cereals with cooked fruits are very appetizing. A bowl of oat- 
meal, eaten for breakfast, will furnish the average man with all the strength, heat and energy 
he will need; it is not necessary for him to eat meat in addition. 

Nuts contain in condensed form the same flesh building material as meat. Some of 
them contain a great deal of fat as well. They should not be eaten between meals, but raw 
or cooked they can take the place of meat. A pound of shelled almonds is equal in food 
value to three pounds of steak. Hickory nuts and pecans added to muffins or yeast breads 
may be used as a substitute for meat. Peanuts are also rich in food and flesh building 
material.

1 34 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Sec. IV— Pt. 2— COOKING AND RECIPES 

BEUianas contain most of the nourishment that meat does, and if eaten with bread 
and butter make an excellent lunch without the addition of meat. Most children prefer banana 
sandwiches to meat sandwiches, and they cost much less. 

Peas, Beans, Lentils are richer in flesh building material than any other vegetables 
and can be used in place of meat. Lentils are more easily digested than either peas or 
beans. If properly prepared, all these make very appetizing dishes. A dish of baked beans, 
costing about fourteen cents, will furnish a family of six with more nourishment than two 
pounds of beef costing forty-four cents. 

In Stating that the various dishes given in this book can be used in place of meat 
it is not our purpose to urge one to give up eating meat altogether. It is a fact, however, 
that as a people we eat too much meat and we would undoubtedly find much benefit physi- 
cally if we cut down the amount of meat we eat, and varied our diet more than we do. 

We do not have to eat meat in order to keep well and strong. A great many people 
never eat meat at all, but find many foods of the strength-giving properties they require. 

If our meat supply continues to dwindle in the future as it has in the past meat will 
some day be very scarce and sooner or later we will have to learn to use other foods in 
place of meat.

SKIM-MILK VERSUS BEEF 

Skim-Milk is a very economical food material and might well be more 
largely used for human food — this in spite of the fact that it is nine-tenths water. 
The experts in the United States Department of Agriculture strongly urge a wider 
use of skim-milk for food. It carries an argument for economy, based on the 
price at which it is usually sold and the composition of the nutritive tenth of its 
contents. 

Whole Milk is an indispensable food for the young, and even in the diet 
of the adult it is comparatively economical. The only nourishing material taken 
from it in skimming is the butter fat. There is left, therefore, in the skim-milk, 
not only all of the sugar, which amounts to about four and a half parts in every 
hundred, and all of the mineral substances, but also all of the protein. The last 
named substance is important because, besides serving as food for the body as 
fats, sugars and starches do, it also supplies tissue-building material. The pro- 
portion of protein in skim-milk, as well as of the mineral constituents, which are 
also valuable for body building, is even greater in whole milk. 

Skim-Milk is to be classed, as whole milk is, vfhh such food materials as 
eggs, meat, fish, poultry and cheese (though it is much more delicate than those 
foods) rather than with such substances as sugar, which serve only as fuel. Two 
and a half quarts of skim-milk contain almost as much protein and yield about the 
same amount of energy as a pound of round of beef. 

When skim-milk sells for four cents a quart, or about two cents a pound, 
and round of beef for twenty cents a pound, a dime or any other sum of money 
spent for skim-milk will provide nearly twice as much nourishment as it will if 
spent for round steak. 



INSTEAD OF MEAT 

(U. S. Food Administration Bulletin Food Leaflet No. 8) 
CHEESE, MILK, EGGS, BEANS, PEAS, NUTS, CEREALS 

These make appetizing dishes to take the place of meat. Why not use 
them oftener? There are plenty of good ways of cooking them. 

They give you a body-building material, the protein, and they give a lot 
of it. 

The child to grow must have food that furnishes this kind of material. 
You need it too. Even if you are grown up, you must have it to renew parts of 
your body used up by work and exercise. 

Don't think you have to eat meat to get this protein. These other foods 
have it, too. Take cottage cheese, for example. It is richer in this material than 
meat. You can eat a third of a cup of it with pleasure, and this third of a cup 
will give you as much of the protein as a quarter of a pound of sirloin steak — 
a good, generous serving. Or if you like baked beans, eat a cupful to give you 
the same amount of protein. 

PEAS, BEANS, PEANUTS, CEREALS 

These are cheaper than meats and good. They should be used, but eat 
some milk or cheese besides. 

CHEESE, MILK, EGGS, MEAT 

These give body-building material in a little better form than the plant 
foods do. 

Cheese is a Fine Meat-Saver. There is a great deal of food in a little piece 
of it. Don't eat it at the end of a meal w^hen you have already had enough. You 
would not eat a piece of meat then. An inch cube of American cheese conteuns 
a third more protein than the same sized piece of lean meat. Cheese is excellent 
food if eaten at the right time. 

Get the Farmers' Bulletin on Cheese, No. 487, to learn how to use it in 
many ways. 

USE THESE GOOD MEAT-SAVERS 

Cottage Cheese is a delicious and easy dish. You can buy it from almost 
any milkman or you can make it yourself. Add salt and pepper before eating, 
and if you prefer it more moist, stir in a little milk. It is good, too, served with 
applebutter, or a bit of jelly. While this is more of a dessert, it can still lessen 
the amount of meat you eat. 

To make cottage cheese, warm sour milk, whole or skimmed, on the back 
of the stove, or put a bowl of it in a pan of hot, not boiling, water for about 20 
minutes. Stir occasionally. When the curd and whey have separated, pour off 
the whey through a sieve. Work the curd with a spoon and let it drain. When 
fairly dry work again until smooth. The whey is good to use in making bread. 

Nuts are concentrated foods, too. Twenty single peanuts are about the 
same as the inch cube of cheese. Remember that nuts are good food. Chew 
them thoroughly or grind them up for a cooked dish and eat them as an important 
part of your meal.

Tender cuts of meat are best broiled, roasted or baked to keep in the juices 
and develop the flavor. The tougher cuts are more nutritious if cooked properly. 
They should be braised, boiled, stewed, or treated to tender in a dressing of olive 
oil, onion juice, lemon parsley, bay leaf, for from 1 hour to 1 2 or 24 hours. 



Pot Roa<t (Boiled Beef) — Select about 4 Iba. 
from rump, round, or brisket. Wipe meat, brown 
quickly in hot tried-out beef luet. Add boiling 
water to half cover. Bring to boil, cover pot, 
simmer I 5 minutes to each pound till very tender, 
.^fter first half-hour, add salt and pepper. 

For pot roast with onions, fry I large sliced 
onion I minute in hot suet, remove, sear meat 
in suet, put onions on top meat, add, sliced, I 
turnip, 1 carrot, cupful canned tomatoes, salt, 
pepper, water to cover vegetables. Close pot 
tight, simmer 2 hours. When meat is tender, 
remove, skim, press gravy through colander, 
thicken and season — pour some hot over roast, 
serve rest of gravy separate. 

Roast Beef — A rolled roast has ribs removed, 
meat rolled and tied. A standing roast has ribs 
left in. 

Wipe meat ^vith damp cloth or scrape. Do not 
wash. Do not salt until partly done. Sear out- 
side quickly with a dash of boiling water or in hot 
oven. Then lower gas and cook for a rare roast 
1 minutes to each lb., basting every 1 5 minutes 
with meat juice, water, or cook in a self-basting 
roaster. I 5 minutes before roast is done, dredge 
with butter, flour, salt and pepper. Use the juice 
from meat plain for gravy. Garnish with horse- 
radish, parsley and Yorkshire pudding. 

Make the pudding 20 minutes before roast is 
done. Mix I Yl cups flour, Yl teasp. salt, 1 teasp. 
baking powder. Beat 2 eggs, add with I Yl cups 
milk to the flour, 'beat. Pour into a hot pan 
greased with beef drippings. When batter is 
about to brown, baste with hot drippings. Brown, 
cut into squares, serve with roast. 

Beef a la Mode — Take several lbs. from under 
part of the round. Wipe, spread with lemon 
juice and oil. Put in ice box several hours. Re- 
move, make sharp incisions through the meat, 
stuff with a mixture of seasoned bread crumbs, 
minced fat pork. Lay strips of fat pork on top, 
dredge with flour, tie to keep in shape. Cover 
meat in pot with minced I onion, carrot, turnip, 
few mixed herbs. Simmer tight closed about 4 
hours. Skim fat from gravy, season, thicken, stir, 
serve on roast. 



Braised Beef — This may be cooked without 
water in a baking dish on a bed of vegetables. 
Partly cook 2 large onions sliced in fat. On these 
lay small pieces of I carrot, I turnip, 3 stalks 
celery, salt, pepper, small bag of 6 mixed spices. 
Dredge 2 lb. piece of meat with flour, place it 
on top of vegetables. Cover. Cook slowly as 
possible 2 hours. 

When time to remove the meat, and vegetables, 
they will have made a gravy of their own juices. 
Serve these around the meat on a hot platter. 

Baked Heart — Cut away tough veins from a 
calf's heart, wash, soak in salted water Yl hour. 
Stuff with forcemeat made of I cup soaked stale 
bread or bread crumbs, I cup chopped salt pork, 
Yi teasp. salt, pepper, I tbsp. melted butter or 
drippings, chopped half onion, 2 tbsp. water; 1 
egg beaten into forcemeat improves it. Stuff the 
heart, bake in slow oven, baste often with beef 
stock or hot water and drippings. Serve in its 
own gravy. Garnish with pickled beets, sprigs of 
parsley or watercress. 

Braised Beef Tongue — Take a fresh tongue and 
boil; that is, wipe, cover in pot with boiling water, 
simmer 2 hours. Remove skin and roots when 
done. Place in braising pan with 2 tbsp. each 
diced carrot, onion, celery, 1 teasp. parsley. Half 
cover with water tongue was boiled in. 

Cook 2 hours. Make a sauce of the gravy by 
adding 2 tbsp. butter rolled in I tbsp. flour sea- 
soned with Yl <^"P tomato juice, salt, paprika, Yl 
teasp. Worcestershire sauce. 

Pour sauce around tongue on hot platter ana 
serve. Mushrooms with a little lemon juice added 
to sauce improves its flavor. 

Beefsteak Broiled — Wipe and trim steak, place 
on a greased hot broiler under a flame. Sear all 
surfaces by turning several times for first minute. 
Cook a thick steak 6 minutes to be rare, 8 min- 
utes well done. Dish up on hot platter. Sprinkle 
with salt, pepper and butter. Serve at once so, 
or with a prepared mushroom or brown sauce. 

Smothered Beef with Macaroni — Cut 2 lbs. 
meat into neat pieces, sear on all sides in hot fat, 
dredge with flour, cover with boiling water, sim- 
mer until nearly done in closed pot. Then add

MUTTON AND ITS VALUE IN THE DIET 

(From U. S. Farmers' Bulletin, No. 526) 

Mutton has from early times been a popular food both in the Orient and 
among western nations. The ease with which the sheep is raised and the fact 
that its flesh is not, like some other meats, excluded on religious grounds from 
the dietary of any large group of people, combine with its palatability to bring it 
into widespread favor. The terms "lamb" and "mutton" are somewhat loosely 
used to designate the meat obtained from the younger and older animals. In 
some localities mutton is used to apply to the flesh of all but young lambs; in others 
its use is limited to the flesh of full-grown sheep. The latter is perhaps the common- 
est usage in the United States. 

The general belief that mutton and lamb are wholesome has been strength- 
ened recently by such work as that of the United States Department of Agri- 
culture whose reports of meat inspection show that it has been necessary to reject 
relatively few mutton carcasses as unfit for food, and that the sheep is particularly 
free from diseases w^hich render meat undesirable. 



COMPOSITION AND NUTRITIVE VALUE 

The term "mutton" is here used to apply to 
the flesh of a sheep one year or more old. Such 
meat differs in composition from the flesh of a 
lamb very much as meat of any other mature 
animal differs from that of a young animal of the 
same kind, as beef differs from veal, for example, 
or fowl from chicken, i.e., it has, in general, a 
smaller percentage of water and larger percen- 
tages of fat, protein, and extractives or flavoring 
substances. Pound for pound, mutton has a 
larger amount of tissue-forming substances and a 
higher energy value than lamb. 

So far as nutritive value is concerned, mutton 
is usually classed with beef. Analyses show that 
they have nearly the same composition. The per- 
centage of waste differs very slightly in the two, 
being on the average a little less than 20 per 
cent, in each. In the edible portion the percen- 
tage of protein is practically the same; it aver- 
ages about 18 per cent, in the beef and 16 per 
cent, in the mutton. It is only when the fat is 
considered that any considerable difference is 
noted. This averages about 20 per cent, of the 
edible portion in medium fat beef and a little over 
30 per cent, in the corresponding kind of mutton. 
As might be expected, water is correspondingly 
low^ in the mutton and high in the beef, being 



about six-tenths, or 60 per cent., of the total in 
the beef and about five-tenths, or 50 per cent., 
of the total in the mutton. Because of the larger 
amount of fat, the fuel or energy value is greater 
in mutton than in beef, being usually stated as 
1,500 calories per pound, while that of beef is 
given as about 1,145 calories. The fact should 
be kept in mind, however, that these figures refer 
to the average of many samples of the two kinds 
of meat. The variations in different samples of 
either meat are wider than the differences between 
these average values, and for this reason the cus- 
tom of classing beef and mutton together when 
their nutritive values are concerned may be con- 
sidered fair. 

RELATIVE ECONOMY IN THE USE OF 
MUTTON 

While mutton and beef do not differ materially 
in percentage composition or digestibility, mutton 
has an advantage in that it is capable of some- 
w^hat more economical use. The mutton carcass, 
unlike the beef carcass, is of such size that a 
quarter or a half, either of which supplies a 
variety of cuts, can be conveniently utilized in a 
household of moderate size with ordinary refrig- 
erating facilities, and the price per pound is com- 
monly less when the meat is bought in this way. 
There is a certain advantage, too, in the fact that 



] 42 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Sec. IV— Pt. 2— COOKING AND RECIPES 



the leg, which has the smallest percentage of 
waste of any of the cuts of mutton, is of suitable 
size for family use, for a piece of meat which 
has not been cut up keeps better than one which 
has been cut. On the other hand, the rather gen- 
eral belief, which, however, seems unfounded, that 
all kinds of mutton fat are unsuitable for culinary 
purposes, has tended somewhat to an uneconomi- 
cal use of this meat. 

CARE OF MUTTON IN THE HOME 

Because of the facility with which mutton ab- 
sorbs odors and flavors, special care should be 
taken of it in the home. When it comes into the 
house, it should be wiped thoroughly with a damp 
cloth, and all portions that have the slightest un- 
pleasant odor about them should be cut oil. Such 
portions are most likely to be found where the 
layer of meat is thin, as, for example, on the 
lower end of the leg, on the flank, or on the 
ribs. When a large piece of mutton is bought, 
these facts should be kept in mind in determining 
which parts should be used first. It is well, for 
example, to remove the flank end of the loin and 



part of the rib bones first, and use them for soups 
or stews. The removal of the membrane and the 
red skin from the surface of the meat before it 
is cooked is also desirable. In roasting mutton, 
many housekeepers believe that it is well to keep 
the meat well up from the pan by means of a 
rack, for if this is not done, the fat of the meat 
is likely to become scorched and to affect the 
flavor of the meat itself. 

JUDGING MUTTON 

There are a number of points which should 
be borne in mind when purchasing mutton for the 
table. The lean portion of the meat should be 
firm, finely grained, and of a deep red color. The 
fat should be well distributed. The leg should 
be nearly covered with a layer of fat and there 
should also be a thick layer over the back. This 
outside layer is often in the trade referred to as 
the "covering." The fat itself should be white, 
hard, brittle, and flaky. The "mottling" of the 
flesh with fat, which is so important a sign of 
good quality in beef, is considered of less im- 
portance in judging mutton. 



RECIPES 



Boiled Leg of Mutton — Select leg weighing 6 
or 8 lbs. with fat white and flaky. Trim, wipe 
off, put on in boiling water, boil until scum rises, 
skim, simmer until tender. Season with I teasp. 
salt, when nearly done, serve with caper sauce. 
The water left may be used for soup, or to season 
meat dishes made from cold mutton. 

Roast Shoulder of Mutton — Have butcher re- 
move bone and trim, put these in cold water, and 
make stock for soup or to baste roast. Stuff 
shoulder with a mixture of 1 cup bread crumbs, 
1 tbsp. melted butter, 2 tbsp. boiling water, '/z 
teasp. grated onion, '/4 teasp. salt, pepper. Add 
a few chopped mushrooms if convenient. Sew 
or skewer to keep dressing in. Place in hot oven 
with I cup water in roasting pan. Baste often. 
In half-hour reduce heat, cook 2 hours. Plain

meat sauce. Garnish daintily with mushrooms or 
parsley or forcemeat balls. Serve dinner vege- 
tables of tomatoes, string beans, green peas, or 
young turnips Pass current jelly. 

Leg of Lamb Roasted — 1. Plain — If leg of Iamb

VEAL is not as easily digested as beef and is less nutritious, but because 
of its tenderness, the contrary is often thought the case. 

For determining quality of good veal, see article on "Choosing Meats," 
under section on MEATS. 

If one can purchase the entire fore-queirter of veal he may secure it at a 
very low price; the breast, though delicious when stuffed and braised, is little 
know^n and demanded. The fore-quarter contains the ribs, corresponding to the 
rib roast of beef, and from these are cut the best chops, the entire rack of veal, 
as the chops are known, makes a roasting equalled only by the loin and the fillet. 
The neck of the veal cuts into excellent breakfast cutlets. The flesh portion of 
the foreleg, or shin, make pot pies or stews, and the leg itself makes soup or stock. 



RECIPES 



Plain Roa«t Veal — Use either the ribs or a leg. 
Trim and wipe, sear all sides quickly in a hot 
roaster. Add 1 cup boiling water to pan. Cover, 
roast at the rate of 20 minutes to each lb., basting 
every 1 5 minutes. Add water to keep pan from 
getting dry. The last 40 minutes salt and pepper 
the meat, dust with flour, put in around it peeled 
halved sweet potatoes. When about done remove 
cover, brown meat and potatoes. 

Shoulder of Veal — This is roasted in the same 
manner except that the bone is removed care- 
fully without breaking the outer skin and a force- 
meat is put in the bone cavity. This stuffitig may 
be of onions, sliced, seasoned, and an equal quantity 
of bread crumbs, or chopped ham and bread crumbs 
with salt and pepper or tomato seasoning. Bake 
the meat until the gravy shows no red color. Take 
up the meat. Thicken liquid in pan with I tbsp. 
flour; when it is browned add boiling water, salt 
and pepper, stir until smooth. Serve this gravy 
with the shoulder of veal and potatoes that have 
been either baked brown with the meat or roasted 
in their jackets. 

Filet of Veal Stuff the hole from which the 

bone is taken with a forcemeat of '/2 cup salt 
pork, chopped, I cup minced ham, I cup bread 
crumbs, I tbsp. salt, Yl teasp. pepper, I teasp. 
lemon juice, parsley, 2 tbsp. gravy or fat. Skewer 
the filet round. Brown surface in hot oven, salt 
and pepper, lay thin slices of salt pork on top. 
Baste with water. Roast in moderate oven sev- 
eral hours. When done remove slices of pork, 
dredge with flour and brown uncovered. While 
roast is browning slice tomatoes, salt and flour 
them, fry quickly in hot lard or cottolene. 



Make gravy of I cup meat gravy, I cup tomato 
puree. Garnish roast with fried tomato slices and 
serve at once, and send in tomato puree gravy 
seasoned with few drops of tobasco or tomato 
catsup. 

Veal Loaf — This may be made as beef loaf, or 
use 3 or 4 lbs. of meat, Yl of which is veal, \i^ 
beef, Ya ^^'t pork. Chop all fine, mix with ! 
minced onion, I tbsp. lemon juice, I tbsp. salt, 
Yl teasp. pepper, 3 tbsp. crumbs, 1 egg. 4 tbsp. 
cream or gravy. Shape into oblong loaf, bake 
slowly about 2 hours, baste every 1 5 minutes. 
Carve loaf at table; serve thin slices with thick 
tomato sauce or catsup; or spinach and rice; or 
mashed sweet potatoes and gravy. 

Veal Pot Pie Take 2 cups cooked veal chopped 

or sliced thin, I onion, and I potato, diced, I cup 
fat pork minced, Yl teasp. salt, few grains cay- 
enne. Moisten well with gravy, add extra cupful. 
Simmer in deep meat pie pan 5 minutes. Cover 
with a rich biscuit dough crust, perforated. Bake 
in moderate oven 40 minutes. 

If crust is not desired cover meat with boiled 
rice seasoned, pour over it I cup tomato juice, 
garnish with halves of hard boiled eggs half im- 
bedded in the rice. Dot with butter and crumbs. 
Bake 30 minutes. Serve in baking dish. 

Veal Breast Breast of veal may be boned and 

stuffed: or spread on one side with a forcenjeat, 
rolled loosely over and tied; or put meat in a 
roaster with pork strips laid over and under it, 
add I cup boiling water, cook until half done, then 
spread with 2 chopped onions, parsley, I chopped 
green pepper, 2 cups peeled and sliced tomatoes.

Finish cooking covered. Lift cover and browrn 
meat, take vegetables out with strainer and serve 
around the meat with plain boiled rice in a sep- 
arate dish. 

The tomatoes in the spread may be omitted, 
and when cover is lifted to brown meat drain out 
the gravy, and cover veal with mashed sweet po- 
tatoes. These will brown on top. Lift meat with 
potatoes to hot platter. Serve with spinach. 

Gelatine of Veal — Gelatine is meat boned, 
stuffed, rolled, boiled and served cold. A breast 
may be used. Spread with a rich, well seasoned 
forcemeat, roll, tie up in cheesecloth. In a pot 
prepare bones, trimming and seasoning as if for 
soup. Add several small vegetables convenient, 
carrot, turnip or onion, half cover with water. 
When this boils, add stuffed roast, boil up, skim, 
then simmer until meat is tender. Cool and 
press the veal with a heavy weight for several 
hours. Serve cold. 

Instead of breast take a knuckle of veal. Boil 
tender, mince the meat, add it to the juice, pour it 
into a mold. While cooling add slices of hard 
boiled egg. Serve cold from the ice box. 

Veal Cutlets, Breaded — Be sure to cook veal 
thoroughly, as it is neither wholesome nor 
palatable if underdone. Bread the cutlets with 
fine breadcrumbs, salt and pepper, dip in beaten 
egg, then crumbs. If not firm, set on ice until 
fat is ready, smoking hot. Drop cutlets in, turn 
within 5 minutes, then cook more slowly so that 
the outside will not get too brown before inside 
is done. Drain off fat, serve at once, in hot dish. 
Sprinkle horse-radish on each cutlet, or serve 
with tomato sauce, or corn muffins and apple 
sauce. 

Veal Shortcake — Make a dough of 2 cups flour, 
2 teasp. baking powder, Yl teasp. salt, 2 tbsp. 
lard, 1 cup milk. Roll thin, cut into 2 squares. 
Dot one with butter, cover with the other square, 
bake in hot oven. 

In the nteantime cream diced cold veal in 1 
cup gravy seasoned and thickened with flour and 
cream. When shortcake is brown separate the 
cakes, spread creamed veal in between them and 
on top. Serve with tart jelly. 



Veal Cutlets Broiled — ^Trim and wipe loin cut- 
lets, turn over and over in salad oil seasoned 
with finely chopped green peppers, a few drops 
of onion juice and lemon. Put on ice in the oil 
mixture I hour. Drain, broil in hot skillet 5 
minutes; turn lower heat, broil 5 minutes or 
longer. Serve with a Spanish sauce. 

Baked Calf's Liver — Remove skin from calFa 
liver, cut deep gashes in upper side, pour boiling 
water on and off until it is thoroughly blanched. 
Spread the gashes and top with a paste of mois- 
tened bread crumbs seasoned with salt, pepper, 
parsley, onion. Lay thin slices salt pork on top. 
Sprinkle with lemon juice. Pour I cup brown 
sauce around the liver. Cook in covered cas- 
serole 2 hours. Serve with small sweet potatoes 
fried in hot fat. 

Broiled Liver — Buy it sliced for broiling, skin, 
blanch I minute in hot water, dry, salt and pep- 
per, moisten with oil and lemon juice, sprinkle fine 
cracker crumbs on and broil until done. 

Calf's Brain — Place in cold salted water as 
soon as received from market. In 30 minutes 
peel all membranes off, wash, and parboil in 
salted water 1 5 minutes. Plunge into cold water, 
put on ice until ready to prepare for the meal. 
TThey may be: 

1. Fried — Cut in pieces size of a small oyster,

POULTRY includes turkey, chicken, duck, etc. — generally domestic fowl. 
The meat of poultry is not so nutritious as beef and mutton, but its tenderness and 
flavor render it most agreeable as a change in the usual bill of fare. 



SELECTING POULTRY 

When selecting a chicken in the average market you cannot always know the history 
of its breeding and feeding though you may look instinctively for the plump breast, rounded 
legs and well-meated back of the fine, well-fed bird. You can tell by other signs whether 
it has been handled from the barnyard to the market in the sanitary and skillful manner 
which keeps a good chicken sweet, fresh and tender; that is, whether it has been properly 
killed and well bled, chilled, dry-picked and carefully packed in cartons under refrigeration. 

Always ask for the dry-picked chicken; select a short, plump, fat one, if possible. 
Its skin should be soft, loose, dry and unbroken, and the breast fat yellow. Scalding a 
chicken for picking removes much of the nutriment, affects the flavor, adds water to its 
w^eight, and makes it less liable to keep well. Avoid a bird with tightly drawn, shiny skin 
and legs that are difficult to draw back. 

If the dry-picked fowl you have selected has been properly bled and air-chilled it 
will be of an even yellow or white color over the entire body, not with discolored neck 
or red blotches on the wings and hips. 

The carton-packed are placed in small groups in boxes, their heads wrapped in 
parchment paper. TTiey are not packed with ice in a barrel. 

These special signs indicate the sanitary treatment of the chickens. To judge age, you 
must know that an old hen or cock has a coarse head, rough skin, rough shanks and feet, 
heavy, blunted toe-nails, rigid breast-bone and long hairs, no pin-feathers. If carefully 
cooked they are suitable for chicken-pie, the casserole and the fricassee. 

The youth and tenderness of a chicken are indicated by a small comb, smooth 
shanks, soft, thin skin, easily bent breast-bone and the presence of pin-feathers. 

Choose spring chicks for broiling; a fairly young, plump one for roasting. 

A young turkey should have plump, pliable breast-bone, smooth, dark legs, very short 
spurs. 

Young ducks and geese not more than a year old have firm, plump breasts, the fat 
is soft and white, the wings tender and the skin between the toes tender. 

Young pigeons have tender, pink legs and light red flesh on breast; on old ones 
it is very dark. Squabs are young tame pigeons; they are very large, but are soft and 
plump covered with pin-feathers. 

Grouse, partridge and quail should have plump breasts, dark legs and yellowish bills. 

Chicken offers 20 per cent of protein, 8 per cent of fat and 850 heat units per 
pound and compares favorably w^ith sirloin steak in the amount of digestible nutrients fur- 
nished.

I 52 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Sec. IV— Pt. 2— COOKING AND RECIPES 



TO DRESS AND 

Remove pin feathers, singe off all hairs. Slit 
<kin down the back of neck, cut neck off even 
with body, cut skin of the leg below knee-joint, 
lightly, without cutting the tendons, break the 
bone with a sharp rap and pull off the foot. 

Make an incision from end of breast bone to 
tail. Hold the fowl steady, reach carefully into 
the body, loosening membranes and removing the 
intestines without breaking them. Cut out of this 
mass the giblets, which are the heart, gizzard and 
liver, being careful not to break the green gall- 
bag near the liver. Put aside the giblets, neck 
and feet for soup or gravy. 

Through the neck opening remove the wind- 
pipe and glands. Allow cold water to run through 
the fowl, wash it quickly and thoroughly inside 
and out. Wipe dry and truss. 

To Stuff a Fowl, force the dressing through the 
opening below the breast bone and the one near 
the neck. If stuffed too tight, bread dressing will 
be soggy and crackers will swell and crack the 
skin. 

To Truss Bend the wings close to the body 

and turn under; push thighs up against the 

breast. Fold the skin over front incision and 

neck. Skewer the wings, thighs and skin into 
place, or sew, or tie with twine. 

When a fowl is dressed, cleaned, trussed and 
stuffed it is ready for roasting or boiling. 



CLEAN POULTRY 

To Prepare for Broiling — Singe, wipe, cut down 
from neck along the back bone, open, remove 
insides, wash, wipe dry, skewer wings and thighs 
close to body. If preferred, cut out the ribs and 
remove breastbone. 

To Cut Up for frying, fricassee or boiling: clean 
and dress; separate legs from body by cutting 
skin and flesh at base of leg and disjoint. Cut 
flesh and disjoint upper leg or second joint from 
lower or drum stick. Cut wings off in same 
manner. Beginning two inches below breastbone 
make an incision following a line below ribs to 
collarbone; disjoint. Slice off the wishbone piece 
from the breast. Divide breastbone. Cut the 
back in two pieces. 

To Prepare Giblets — Use only healthy looking 
giblets. The liver should be light in color. Care- 
fully cut away from it the green gall bladder with- 
out breaking. Remove membranes and blood 
from the heart, leaving only the fleshy part. Re- 
move fat from gizzard, cut open, peel off the out- 
side muscle from the inside skin. Wash giblets, 
place in cold water. Cook until tender, mines 
fine and add to the gravy. When cooked ^vith 
neck and wing-tips there is enough stock for 
gravy. 

The legs of a young fowl make as nutritious 
jelly as calves* feet. Scald legs until the skin 
and claws will peel off. Place legs in cold salted 
water and simmer until flesh falls from bones. 



POULTRY 

Boiled Chicken — An old fowl will do for boil- 
ing. Clean according to directions; rub inside 
and out with lemon juice to make the meat white, 
juicy and tender. It may be stuffed with a poultry 
dressing or boiled plain. To have it ke»p its 
shape, tie up close in a cheese cloth. Plunge in 
boiling water to nearly cover. Simmer gently, 20 
minutes to the pound. The last hour add salt and 
tie up in cheese cloth bag Yi cup washed rice. 
The bag must be large enough to allow for rice to 
swell. Put in with chicken. When done, lift 
chicken out of bag to hot platter, garnish with a 
border of drained rice. Pour over it some 
oyster or celery sauce, or make a dressing of 
parsley, celery, hard boiled eggs chopped and 
added to a pint of skimmed gravy from the boiling 
pot. 

Roast Chicken — Prepare a 3 to 5 lb. chicken 
for cooking, rinse inside with cold soda and water, 
wipe, rub with salt and pepper and lemon, stuff 
with a dry dressing of 1 cup dry bread crumbs, 
2 tbsp. butter, !4 teasp. salt, '/8 teasp. pepper. 
If onion flavor is liked, brown one small onion 
minced in the butter before stirring in the crumbs, 
add minced parsley if desired, or sage. Wet 



RECIPES 

dressing is made by moistening with I /3 cup milk. 
When chicken is stuffed, rub over the breast and 
legs a paste of flour and butter and dust bottom 
of pan with flour. Place in hot oven. When flour 
is brown, baste with 2 tbsp. butter in J/^ cup 
hot water. Lower oven heat, cover tight, roast I 5 
minutes to each lb. If water dries out in pan, 
baste with more. Serve with a gravy made of 
the thickened chicken broth and the giblets chopped 
fine. 

If a roasting pan is used it is not necessary 
to put it in the oven. A delicious roast is the 
result if the meat or fowl is put in roaster with 
some water and seasonings and set on top of the 
stove. It should steam slowly until tender. If 
needed, add a little water but uncover as little 
as possible. TTie meat when done will be juicy 
and well flavored; make gravy with the juice. 

Broiled Chicken — Prepare a very young one, 
split it down back, wipe inside and out, sprinkle 
with salt, pepper and salad oil. Place on broiler 
with inside uppermost under flame, until nearly 
brown. Broil 1 2 minutes to the lb., turning often. 
Serve breast up on hot platter with drawn butter 
sauce poured over. Garnish with parsley or water- 
cress.

Under this head is included all wild animals and wild fowl used for food. 
In cooking either, apply the same general rules already given for meats and poul- 
try, remembering that all white meated game should be cooked well done; dark 
meated game rare, and both must be sent to the table very hot, with hot plates. 
Wild meat contains a much greater percentage of phosphates, and much more 
lean than fat, while the lean is of much greater density than the flesh of domes- 
ticated animals. It follows that they are a strong food, and, if well digested, very 
nutritious. 

When game is kept many days it should be drawn, the inside rubbed with 
salt and pepper, and it does no harm to put some lumps of charcoal in the cavity. 
If there is any objection to washing, it must be very carefully drawn and then 
wiped with a damp cloth until perfectly clean. Neither salt nor pepper should 
touch the outside of the meat until it is cooked. 

Simplicity is the highest perfection in cooking, especially of game, and all 
seasoning, sauces and accompaniments should be subordinate to the flavor of the 
meat. 



RECIPES 



Roast Venison — Venison, the meat of deer, 
should be cooked rare and served very hot. It 
will be too dry if not covered thoroughly with butter 
and basted often with hot water and butter, or 
larded with strips of pork. Put the larded leg 
or saddle of venison in a covered roaster with a 
little water. Cook 20 minutes to each lb., bast- 
ing every 1 5 minutes. Half hour before it should 
be done baste with claret or melted currant jelly. 
Make a gravy with the drippings seasoned. Pour 
into gravy boat, serve some tart jelly with the 
roast. 

Loin haunch or leg may be roasted in the same 
way. 

When the roast is to be reheated, slice it and

Wild Ducks — These should be carefully picked, 
singed, washed outside, drawn and wiped inside 
with a cloth wet in soda and water. 

For a casserole cut the birds up neatly. Split 
them down the back for broiling or smothering. 
Leave them whole for roasting and truss with the 
neck twisted down to cover the opening in breast, 
the tail turned down to close opening through 
which it was drawn. Season with salt and pepper. 
Cook rare 20 to 30 minutes. 

If stuffing is used, select either a dry bread 
dressing, or oysters rolled in egg and dry bread 
crumbs toasted in butter, or chopped onion, cel- 
ery, and crumbs. All wild birds may be pre- 
pared in about the same ways. 

Broiled Quail — Pick, singe, draw and cut off 
heads and feet of 6 quail. Wipe out with a wet 
cloth, split down the back, spread inside and out 
with oil, pepper and salt, broil on both sides 1 5 
or 20 minutes. Baste with the oil and drippings 
if the birds seem to get dry before they are done. 
Serve plain on buttered toast, or with a spoonful 
each of hot bread sauce topped with crisp fried 
bread crumbs. 

Smothered Prairie Chicken — Prepare as quail 
for broiling. Brown lightly in hot skillet, then 
arrange in a steaming pan with tight cover.

and stuff if desired with an oyster dressing to 
which finely minced fat pork has been added or 
a seasoned bread crumb dressing, or spread in- 
side of the birds with butter, tie slices of fat pork 
on the back and thighs, as the grouse is a dry 
meat bird. Place in a covered roaster with 1 cup 
boiling water, roast 45 n»inutes. Brown and 
serve with jelly sauce. 

Pigeon Pie — The birds may be floured as for 
roasting and browned quickly in butter, spread

Fish is an important part of our food supply. Fresh fish is less stimulating 
and nourishing than meat, but is considered more easily digested. Fish msJces an 
agreeable change in the usual routine of a roast, broil, fry and boil. A notable 
advantage is the short time required to cook fish; another is the great variety of 
kinds through the long list of fresh and salt water, red or white fleshed, dry, salt 
or fresh. The w^hite fleshed fish is more easily digested than the red fleshed. 
Examples are whitefish, haddock, cod, flounder, perch, pickerel, crappies, etc. 
Examples of red fleshed fish are salmon, shad, lake trout, etc. Very large fish 
are, as a rule, better when boiled or steamed; medium sized ones should be baked 
or split and broiled, and small ones fried. Red fleshed fish, being richer in fat, 
should not be fried. 

A fish is in good condition when the eyes are bright, the gills a bright clear 
red, scales shiny, the flesh firm and free from a disagreeable odor. 

Mayor Mitchell's Food Committee on Fish 

The habit of eating fish on Friday only is absurd, and should be stopped. 
Fish are just as appetizing and nourishing on Tuesday and Thursday as on Fri- 
day, and if you and your neighbors w^ill buy fish any day in the week you will get 
cheaper fish and better fish. Hundreds of carloads of fish are sent from New York 
to other cities because the people of Nev^ York do not appreciate the value of fish 
as a food and do not buy it as often as they should. 

Vary your diet as much as you can. You will be more healthy if you do. Don't 
use meat so much. Use fish more. Fish is just as nourishing as lean meat and if eaten with 
bread, potatoes, etc., will supply all the needs of the body. If possible, buy your fish 
from a fish dealer. 

When you buy fish see that you get the trimmings. You are just as much entitled 
to them as you are to the trimmings of your meat. 

The meat part of almost any fish may be cooked separately. If you ask your fish 
dealer to remove the meat part of the fish for you, the trimmings will consist of the head, 
the skeleton and the fins, and these can be used for fish stock out of which can be made 
excellent fish soups and fish sauces. 

Halibut costs from fifteen to twenty-two cents a pound. Market cod costs about 
five cents less a pound, and can be cooked in the same way as halibut. It can be cut u' 
into steaks; it can be boiled; the tail can be split and broiled in the same way that you would 
broil mackerel or bluefish, and it costs about eight cents less a pound than either mackerel or 
bluefish. i 

Haddock costs about five cents to eight cents less a pound than halibut and can be 
cooked in the same way. Both cod and haddock are in season all the year and if properly 
cooked are extremely appetizing. 

When you buy bluefish get a large sized fish; it costs about five cents a pound less 
than a medium sized one, and if you buy a large one you will have enough left over for

1 60 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Sec. IV— Pt. 2— COOKING AND RECIPES 

another meed. Any fish left over can be used to make fish cakes or can be creamed and 
put into a dish and baked. 

Many People go to a fish store and buy the fillets of a fish instead of buying the 
whole fish. A fillet of fish is nothing more or less than the meat of the fish stripped from 
the skeleton. Some fish dealers have these fillets all ready on a platter for sale, but if you 
buy them that way you will pay anjrwhere from five to twenty cents more a pound ioi 
them than if you buy the entire fish and ask the dealer to strip the fillets off for you and 
give you the trimmings. 



HOW TO TELL WHEN FISH IS FRESH 

In fresh fish the eyes are bright, the gills red, and the Hesh firm and odorless. Put 
fish in water, and if it sinks you will know it is fresh. If it floats, it is a sign it is not fresh, 
and it should not be used. Serious illness is apt to follow the eating of fish that is not fresh. 

Cleaning Fish — Be sure that your fish is thoroughly cleaned before cooking. It should 
be cleaned as soon as it is bought. 

Fish in Seeison — Cod, scrod, haddock and chicken halibut can be obtained prac- 
tically all the year. (Scrod is young cod split down the back and the backbone removed 
except a small portion near the tail. Chicken halibut is the kind usually found in the 
markets. ) 

Flounders are not so good in November, December and January. 

Smelts are in season from June to March. 

Mackerel is in season from May to September. 

Shad is in season from January to June. 

Salmon is in season from May to September, but it can be obtained the greater part 
of the year. 

Bluefish are in season from May to October. As it is frozen and kept in cold 
storage from six to nine months it njay be obtained practically the year round. 



THE TUNA FISH 



It is surprising that more are not familiar with the tuna fish. It provides a most 
satisfactory fish dinner at a moment's notice, and it is a veritable delicacy that every house- 
wife should keep in stock. 

The meat of the tuna fish is pure and white, greatly resembling lobster meat and, 
to many, much like it in flavor. In Norway it is much preferred to fillet of sole. But its 
greatest advantage lies in its adaptability. It may be broiled and used w^ith toast, it makes 
a most tempting sandwich, with crisp lettuce, and for a fish salad no other fish can rivsJ it. 

The commercial tuna is a small fish found off the coast of Alaska and California 
and off Finland and Norway. We get most of it from California. 

It is one of the nourishing foods. Like the salmon, it is a fat fish, and supplies 
many calories, or units of body fuel. The salmon has 9.5 per cent of fat and the tuna 9.1 
per cent. The salmon's calories, or food value per pound, is 685. The tuna's, 669. 

The tuna may be served cold, 83 an hors d'oeuvre, or it may be broiled and spread 
on toast, like emchovy paste, as a relish. But, best of all, it may be taken solid from the 
can, thoroughly heated, garnished with dabs of butter and bits of bacon, and served as the 
chief dish for a Friday dinner. 

The meat of the tinned tuna fish is so white and solid that it lends itself admirably 
to all sorts of treatment for serving, even for frying. 



CLASS 9— FISH— PREPARATION 



161 



THE PREPARATION OF FISH 



White fleshed fish are best broiled or planked, larger white fleshed fish are 
best boiled and served with sauce Hollandaise or Maitre d'Hotel butter (eis bass, 
cod, halibut, red snapper, haddock) , as they need the addition of some form of fat 
to give flavor and nutriment. Small fish (as brook trout, smelts, etc.) are best 
fried. Halibut slices may be dipped in egg and bread crumbs and fried in fat. 

DIRECTIONS 

Baked Fish — Clean, wipe and dry the fish; rub 
with salt inside and out; stuff and sew; cut gashes 
two inches apart on each side so they will alter- 
nate and skewer into the shape of an S or en O. 
Put the fish on a greased baking sheet, or if this 
fish sheet is not at hand place strips of cotton 
cloth under the fish by which it may be lifted 
from the pan. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and 
place narrow strips of pork lardoons in the gashes. 
Place in a hot oven without water; baste with hot 
water and butter as soon as it begins to brown 
and repeat every ten minutes afterwards. For a 
four-pound fish the time would be an hour. Re- 
move to a hot platter; draw out the string; wipe 
off all water or fat which remains from the fish, 
remove pieces of pork. Garnish the head of fish 
with parsley or watercress. 

Stuffing for Baked Fish — I. One cup cracker 
crumbs, !4 teasp. salt, '/g teasp. pepper, I teasp. 
chopped onions, 1 teasp. chopped parsley, I teasp. 
capers, I teasp. chopped pickles, 3 tbsp. melted 
butter; this is sufficient for a fish weighing 4 to 6 
pounds. 

2. 1 cup bread crumbs, I tbsp. minced onion, 
2 tbsp. butter, I teasp. chopped parsley, '/^ teasp. 
salt. Ye teasp. pepper, I egg. Soak bread in cold 
water; when soft, press out all the water; fry 
onion in butter, add the bread, parsley and sea- 
soning. Add the beaten egg at last. 

3. J/2 cup lean veal, ]/g, lb. fat bacon, J4 C"P 
bread crumbs, 54 teasp. salt, '/'g teasp. pepper, I 
teasp. onion, 1 teasp. parsley. Chop the meat 
very fine, add the bread crumbs soaked and 
pressed and the seasonings. 

Broiled Fish — Large fish should be split through 
the back to broil, head and tail are usually re- 
moved. Salmon, halibut and sword fish are cut 
in inch slices for broiling. Smelts and other small 
fish are broiled whole. Clean and wipe fish as 
dry as possible, sprinkle with salt and pepper, 
place in a well-greased broiler. Broil the flesh 
side first till almost done, then cook on the skin 
side just long enough to brown well. Small fish 
require from 5 to 6 minutes, thick ones from 20 
to 30 minutes. To remove from the broiler, 
loosen one side from the wires first, turn and 



To Clean a Fish — Remove the scales by scrap- 
ing with a dull knife from the tail toward the 
head. Head and tail may be left on or removed 
according to the manner of cooking. Small fish 
to be served whole have the entrails removed by 
opening under the gills and pressing out their 
contents with the thumb and finger; example, 
smelts. Larger fish are split half-way down the 
belly and the insides scraped and washed with 
salt and water after it is empty. Wipe the fish 
inside and out with i* cloth wrung out in cold 
salted water, then wipe with a dry, clean cloth. 

To Skin a Fish — First remove the fins along the 
back and cut off a narrow strip of skin the en- 
tire length of the back. Loosen the skin over the 
bony parts of the gills and slowly work toward 
the tail. Do the same on the other side. 

To Bone a Fish — Clean fish and remove head; 
beginning at the tall, run sharp knife close to the 
backbone, cutting the meat away on one side and 
working toward the head. Turn and repeat on 
the other side. 

Boiled Fish — Clean the fish according to the 
directions, wipe carefully and rub with salt. 
Wrap in a piece of cheesecloth to hold the fish 
together and to prevent the scum from adhering 
to the fish. Place it in a kettle half filled with 
boiling water, cook slowly, allowing fifteen or 
twenty minutes to the pound. A long fish-kettle 
with a rack is useful. A wire basket in a kettle 
may be substituted, the fish coiled about in the 
basket. The water in which the fish cooks should 
have salt and vinegar or lemon juice added, 2 
teasp. of salt and I of vinegar to a qt. of water. 
The salt gives flavor, the vinegar or lemon juice 
keeps the fish white. The fish is cooked when 
flesh is firm and separates easily from the bone. 
Take from the water and remove cheesecloth. 
Garnish with parsley and slices of lemon. 

Steamed Fish — Clean carefully but without re- 
moving head or fins; rub inside and out with salt 
and pepper and lemon juice, laying slices of onion 
inside if liked. Lay on a buttered paper and 
steam till the fish falls easily from the bones. Lay 
on a folded napkin, garnish with lemon and 
parsley and serve with a Hollandaise sauce.

loosen on the other side, then slip from broiler to 
hot platter. Spread with butter and set in warm- 
ing oven to let it penetrate the fish. 

To broil fish in a gas stove, clean and dry as 
usual, only it is better to remove the backbone. 
Put under the flames an iron or granite baking 
dish w^ell greased. Place the fish on this, skin 
dow^n, sprinkle w^ith salt and pepper, dot with 
butter and dredge with flour. When nicely 
brow^ned reduce heat; time required, from 25 to 
30 minutes. 

Fried Fish — Wipe the fish dry, sprinkle with 
salt, then dip in flour or crumbs, then dip in egg, 
and again in flour or crumbs, and fry in deep fat. 

Panned Fish — ^This is suitable for any small fish 
or such as can be cut in slices. Have the fish well 
cleaned, seasoned with pepper and salt and dried 
with a little flour; or, better still, very fine bread 
crumbs. Have a large frying pan smoking hot 



with as little grease in it as will keep the fish from 
sticking. Dripping from good sweet pork is the 
best, but any sweet drippings will do. When the 
fat begins to smoke blue, lay in the fish and 
brown quickly on both sides, then cover closely 
and set back to cook more slowly, from 10 to 20 
minutes, according to the size of the fish. Bass 
in all its varieties is suitable to cook in this way; 
so are butterfish, cisco (lake herring), herring, 
perch, porgies, trout, weakfish, etc. 

Saute Fish — Prepare your fish as for frying and 
cook in frying pan with small amount of fat. Cod 
steaks and smelts should be cooked in this w^ay. 

Salt Fish — Very salt fish should be cooked sev- 
eral hours in 3 or 4 changes of warm water. 
Place the skin side up, so that salt crystals may 
fall away from the under side or meat side. Wipe 
carefully and clean, then soak an hour in very 
cold water.

CLASS 9— FISH— RECIPES 



163 



Boiled Salmon Trout — Clean a small salmon, 
sew up in cheeaecloth, place in kettle with boiling 
salted water to cover. Add a tbsp. vinegar. Cook 
slowly, 20 to 30 minutes. Remove cheesecloth, 
slide fish to a hot platter. Pour over it a white 
cream sauce with egg, or a cream sauce with peas. 
Garnish with parsley and lemon slices. 

Planked Shad — While the plank is heating un- 
der the oven flame, wash, split and dry a 3 lb. 
shad, sprinkle with salt, pepper, few drops of 
olive oil, lay skin down on hot plank, cook quickly 
20 minutes. During that time boil white potatoes 
until mealy, drain, add butter, salt and rich milk; 
beat until smooth and stiff enough to stand alone. 
Drop spoonfuls of the potato on the plank around 
the shad. Put where the potatoes will brown, 
spread over the fish a dressing of melted butter 
and lemon juice. Serve. 

Shad Roe This may be broiled, fried, baked or 

creamed. Wipe roe with wet cloth, dry, sprinkle 
with salt and pepper. Broil 5 minutes on greased 
wire broiler under flame, turn, and while the roe 
is cooking on the other side, place thin slices of 
bacon on top. Both roe and bacon will be done 
at the same time. Serve at once with lemon 
slices. 

To Fry — Roll in flour, egg, bread crumbs, fry 
in deep fat, serve with Maitre d'Hotel butter 
sauce. 

To Boil Cook in gently boiling water 1 min- 
utes, serve with tomato sauce. 

Creamed (Baked) — Crumble 2 boiled shad 
roes with a fork, stir lightly into a plain cream 
sauce, season with salt and pepper. Mix in the 
chopped whites of 2 hard-boiled eggs, turn into 
a glass baking dish. Crumble the hard-boiled 
yolks on top. Place in hot oven for a few min- 
utes before serving. 

Boiled Filet of Flounder — Filet the fish; that is, 
take backbone out and cut each half in about 2 
neat long slices. Wipe these, season with salt, 
lemon juice and oil. Roll each slice up with 
skin side inside; pin with a toothpick; put on ice 
1 5 minutes to stiffen. Arrange filets in pan, add 
I cup water, I tbsp. butter, simmer 1 5 minutes, 
then lift them out with a flat wire spoon, lay on 
buttered toast and pour over them a thick cream 
sauce cooked with chopped parsley. 

Fish Kedgeree Hard boil 2 eggs, wash 1 cup 

rice, boil until tender, drain; mix 2 cups of cooked 
fish flaked with the rice and diced egg whites. 
Turn into a hot pan with 2 tbsp. butter. Season 
and stir until hot all through. Serve quickly on 
a hot dish, garnish with parsley and grated egg 
yolks. Canned tuna fish is nice prepared in this 
way. 



Tuna Fish with Mayonnaixe — Canned tuna fish 
is usually too rich to serve cold unless rinsed in 
boiling water to remove some of the fat. Then 
chill it in the whole piece. At the same time 
marinade on ice in spiced vinegar, I can of as- 
paragus tips and Yl can stringed beans in sep- 
arate dishes. At serving time dish the whole piece 
of tuna fish on a platter, cover with stiff mayon- 
naise, garnish with the asparagus tips and string 
beans. 

Fried Tuna Fish — To fry tuna, wipe it as thor- 
oughly dry as possible without breaking and pre- 
pare fat for immersion. Do not use the old fry- 
pan method. Beef fat is good because it does 
not leave the fish greasy, or some of the modern 
prepared cooking fats of today are even better. 
Do not get the fat smoky. Prepare a lot of very 
fine bread crumbs, beat eggs without separating 
yolks and whites, and brush this over the fish. 
Sprinkle with the bread crumbs and place in a 
wire basket. Throw a few bread crumbs in the 
fat and if they brown in thirty seconds the fat is 
just right. Immerse the fish in the fat by means 
of the wire basket and when they are browned 
and crisped outside, remove and drain in a warm 
place. Serve the fish on a folded napkin on a 
platter garnished with lemon and parsley. 

Tuna in the Can — If you heat the tuna fish in 
the can an excellent sauce for serving ^vith it is 
made of 2 cups of milk, 2 cups of water, 5 tbsp. 
butter, 3 tbsp. flour, '/^ teasp. pepper and Yl 
teasp. salt. First put 3 teasp. butter in a sauce- 
pan and cook the flour in it, then add the boiling 
liquid, the remainder of the butter, bit by bit, and 
the seasoning. Boil 6 minutes. 

Tuna Hors d*Oeuvres As an hors d'oeuvre a 

tuna fish meat may be served by cutting into 
tempting little bits the solid white meat, thoroughly 
chilled, and with it serve a generous slice of 
lemon. Sprinkle paprika on the meat and garnish 
with parsley. 

Tuna Paste A paste may be made of tuna meat 

by mincing it thoroughly and forcing it through 
coarse cheesecloth. Lightly brown a narrow slice 
of bread. With the tuna meat paste mix paprika 
and enough salt to make it more than ordinarily 
salty. Spread this thinly on the toasted bread and 
hold again over the hot coals of the gas flame un- 
til the fish paste has browned. Serve hot for a 
relish. If you cannot get sufficiently coarse 
cheesecloth, use a very fine sieve. Put only 
enough butter with this to moisten. Too much 
spoils the flavor. 

Tuna Filet For a filet nothing is better than 

the tuna fish. Many people place it ahead of sole. 
Cut the meat in strips an inch wide, roll the strips 
over and fasten ^vith a skewer. Immerse in hot 



1 64 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Sec. IV— Pt. 2— COOKING AND RECIPES 



fat or cooking oil as in frying. The tinned tuna 
fish need be in the oil no more than 3 minutes. 
Drain carefully and serve on a napkin, garnishing 
the filet with parsley and lemon. 

Canned Scdmon (Baked) — Remove bones and 
skin from canned salmon, flake the fish and sim- 
mer in its own liquor. Mix 1 tbsp. butter, 1 tbsp. 
flour in I cup milk; add I tbsp. lemon juice, few 
grains cayenne; stir sauce into salmon with 2 
sliced hard-boiled eggs. This may be poured into 
a buttered baking dish, sprinkled with crumbs and 
browned in hot oven, or it may be spread in a 
casserole dish on a bed of boiled rice or thin 
sliced cooked potatoes. Cover with rice or pota- 
toes and steam 20 minutes. Serve with peas, or 
HoUandaise sauce. 

Creamed Salmon — Remove bits of skin and 
bones and flake the canned salmon; mix with 4 
finely chopped hard boiled eggs, I cup bread 
crumbs, 2 tbsp. melted butter, 1 cup milk, J/2 teasp. 



salt, dash of pepper. Heat slowly to boil, stirring 
often, then pour it over crisp buttered toast or 
puffed pastry browned. 

Sardines or tuna fish may be used instead of 
the salmon. 

Salt Codfish Balls — Soak I cup of shredded salt 
codfish in 2 cups water, 1 5 minutes, drain. Sim- 
mer with 2 cups sliced potatoes until they are 
tender, drain and mash. Beat in until thoroughly 
mixed, 1 beaten egg, 1 tbsp. butter, pepper, and 
salt if needed. Dip tablespoonfuls of the mixture 
in hot fat when brown, drain, serve. 

A quicker way when cold cooked potatoes are 
at hand is to mix mashed potatoes with the soaked 
codfish, or canned salmon or any cold fish. Sea- 
son, moisten with I tbsp. warm milk, and I tbsp. 
melted butter stirred into an egg. Mold the mix- 
ture into balls, dip lightly in flour, fry in hot fat 
to cover, drain, serve at once on hot dish witk 
tomato sauce.

Eggs are such familiar every-day articles of food that hardly anybody con- 
siders it a problem to be able to cook them properly. Yet there are good and bad 
ways of preparing eggs. The egg is one of the most valuable of muscle-making 
foods and when properly cooked is easily digested. 

To Tell Fresh Eggs — If an egg is "strictly fresh" it will, when placed in a 
pan of water, lie on its side on the bottom. 

If stale, it will stand on end, and if very old will rise to the surface. 

When just a few^ days old the egg will begin to tilt a trifle, and as it ages 
more and more the angle at which it tilts will increase. 

In shaking an egg, if it makes a sound it is not good and should be re- 
jected. 

To keep yolks of raw eggs fresh for several days, drop unbroken into a 
bow^l of cold water. 

When boiling eggs, wet the shells thoroughly with cold water before plac- 
ing them in boiling water, and they w^ill not crack. 

Cracked eggs can be boiled by adding a teasp. salt to the water, and they 
will not lose any of the white or albumen 



RECIPES 



Breakfast eggs should never be boiled. A thin 
shell of the white is made hard and indigestible 
while the bulk of the egg is barely warmed 
through. 

Boiled Eggs — For soft boiled eggs put 6 into 
a vessel that will hold 2 qts. Fill with boiling 
water, cover closely and set on the stove shelf 
for 6 to 8 minutes. For medium, 10 minutes; 
for hard boiled, 40 to 45 minutes. 

Poached Eggs — Fill a shallow pan nearly full of 
salted boiling water. As soon as the water sim- 
mers, not boils, slip in the eggs one by one, from 
a dish into which they have previously been 
broken. Dip the water over them with a spoon, 
that the yolk may be cooked. When the white 
is firm and a film has formed over the yolk, take 
out each egg with a skimmer. Drain well, place 
on buttered toast, sprinkle with salt, pepper. 
Serve at once. 

Poached eggs may be -done in milk, stock or 
gravy, which can be poured over the toast on 
which they are served. 

Griddled Eggs — Heat the griddle almost as 
much as for baking cakes, butter it lightly and 
arrange small muffin rings on it. Drop an egg in 
each and turn as soon as lightly browned. They 
resemble fried eggs, but are far more delicate. 



Scrambled Eggs — Take small piece of butter 

and a little cream; warm in a frying pan. Break 

6 eggs in it and stir until slightly cooked. Serve 
hot. 

Fried Eggs — Fried eggs may be done in butter, 
oil, or any sweet fat; the pan should hold enough 
fat to almost cover the eggs; the eggs should be 
slipped into the fat singly from a cup; dip the 
hot fat over them : do not let the fat get hot enough 
to "frizzle" the whites. Season with salt and pep- 
per. Serve at once. 

Plain Omelet — Break 4 eggs into a bowl, add 
Yl teasp. salt, '/g teasp. pepper. Give several 
beats with a fork and add milk. Melt the butter 
in omelet pan, pour in the eggs, shake over a 
moderate fire until they are set. Roll and turn into 
hot dish. 

To make jelly, parsley, ham, cheese or chicken 
omelet, spread the seasoning over the eggs just 
before rolling them. 

A Secret with Omelets — In making omelets put 
the salt ^vith the whites of the eggs instead of the 
yolk and the omelet will not fall, but will be dry 
and pufify. 

To Fold and Turn Omelets — Hold an omelet 
pan by the handle in the left hand; with a knife 



171 



1 72 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Sec. IV— Pt. 2— COOKING AND RECIPES 



make two inch cuts opposite each other at right 
angles to the handle; place knife under omelet 
nearest handle, tip pan slowly over a hot platter, 
pass knife under omelet slowly when the omelet 
will fold out. 

Light Omelet — For each egg allow J4 teasp. 
salt, a dash of pepper, I tbsp. of liquid (milk, 
cream, stock, tomato, etc.), break whites and yolks 
separately, beating each until very light. Add 
liquid and seasonings to yolks, fold the yolks into 
the whites, stirring as little as possible. Have the 
omelet pan hot, melt in it I teasp. butter, turn in 
the omelet and cook over a slow fire until well 
browned on the bottom, then set in the oven until 
the top is set. Fold carefully, not to break the 
crust, and turn into a hot dish. Serve at once. 

This omelet is delicious made with minced ham, 
green peas, 1 cup grated or chopped sweet corn 
or asparagus tips. The latter should be well 
cooked, drained, seasoned and spread on just be- 
fore folding the omelet. The ham may be folded 
in or mixed through the whole egg. 

Spanish Omelet — Cut 4 oz. bacon in thin slices, 
and then into half inch squares. Fry until crisp 
and add I small onion, 1 tomato chopped fine and 
5 mushrooms chopped fine. Cook for 15 minutes. 
Rub the spoon with a clove of garlic. Break 6 
eggs into a bowl, add Yi teasp. salt, '/s teasp. pep- 
per, give several strong strokes and turn into a 
buttered frying pan. Bake until nearly set, spread 
the bacon and vegetables quickly over, fold, set in 
oven for I minute, turn it upon a hot platter and 
serve with tomato sauce. 

Rice Omelet — Warm 1 cup milk in a double 
boiler, add 1 cup cold boiled rice, and 1 tbsp. 
butter, stir and beat till well blended; add 3 eggs 
well beaten, and Yi teasp. salt. Melt 1 tbsp. but- 
ter in omelet pan; when hot turn the rice mixture 
in and let it brown 1 minute; put in oven to set, 
fold and serve. 

Chicken Liver Omelet — Cook together I cup 
minced cooked liver and Yl <="? Spanish sauce or 
brown gravy; add I teasp. vinegar, 1 tbsp. chopped 
mushrooms, Yl teasp. salt, few grains cayenne. 
Keep warm while preparing omelet; make the 
omelet following directions as given for light 
omelet. Just before folding spread with the liver 
mixture. Serve with brown sauce or tomato sauce. 

Omelet with Cheese — Beat 4 eggs very light, 
add Yl c"P 'ni"'' ' *^^^P- ''°"'' " ''"'^ parsley, 
pepper and salt, Yl teacupful grated cheese. 1 
tbsp. butter. Beat all well together and pour into 
well buttered pan. Let it cook till light brown; 
shake the pan while omelet is cooking. Serve at 
once. 

Omelet with Oysters— Blanch 1 dozen small Blue 
Point oysters by bringing them just to the boiling 



point in their own liquor, seasoned with a dash 
of cayenne, I saltsp. of salt, and a grate of nut- 
meg; mix an omelet, place over the fire, and 
when it begins to cook at the edges, place the 
oysters, without any liquor, in the center, fold 
. together and serve at once. 

Eggs, Rice and Spinach — Boil and blanch a cup- 
ful of rice and heap it on the center of a platter. 
With the back of a spoon make places for as many 
eggs as you wish to serve. Break each egg care- 
fully into its place, and season. Place spinach, 
cooked and seasoned, around the edge of the rice. 
Bake until the eggs are as firm as you like them. 

Curried Eggs — Cook I teasp. chopped onion and 

3 tbsp. butter in small frying pan for 3 minutes; 
add 1 tbsp. flour and I teasp. curry powder; stir 
until it becomes smooth, then add I cup stock. 
Yl <="P milk, or cream, salt and pepper to taste, 
and cook for 1 minutes. Quarter 6 hard-boiled 
eggs, place in a deep saucepan, strain the sauce 
over them, simnier for 3 minutes. Serve very hot 
vf\\\\ toast. 

The teasp. of curry powder gives a delicate 
flavor. More may be used if desired. 

Scalloped Eggs — Boil 8 eggs twenty minutes. 
Crumble about half of small loaf of bread. Put 

4 cups milk, 3 tbsp. butter and several sprigs of 
parsley in a pan and heat; when hot. thicken with 
a heaping tbsp. flour, salt and pepper to taste. 
Put into buttered baking dish first a layer of 
bread crumbs, then a layer of sliced eggs, a little 
pepper and salt, more butter, if desired; then a 
few tbsp. white sauce, and so on. with a layer of 
bread crumbs on top. Bake 30 minutes. 

Deviled Eggs — Cut 4 hard-boiled eggs into 
halves, lengthwise; remove the yolks, being care- 
ful not to break the whites. Powder the yolks 
with a silver fork: then add 1 teasp. mustard, I 
teasp. salt, a dash of paprika and cayenne pepper 
and I tbsp. vinegar mixed together; add 1 tbsp. 
butter or olive oil or half a cupful mayonnaise; 
mix until smooth and fill into the whites; rough 
the tops with a fork. Serve on lettuce. 

Creamed Eggs — Boil 6 or 10 eggs hard, put 
into cold water, and carefully take off shells. Put 
into a deep dish and cover with a drawn butter 
sauce made of 1 pt. milk, 1 tbsp. butter, I small 
spoonful cornstarch and a little salt. A very nice 
tea dish, easily prepared for unexpected guests. 

Stuffed Eggs — Cut 6 hard-boiled eggs into 
halves, crosswise or lengthwise. Rub the yolks 
to a paste with 3 tbsp. minced ham, Yl teasp. salt, 
Yi teasp. pepper, \^ teasp. mustard; moisten mth 
1 tbsp. butter and I tbsp. vinegar; form into balls 
the size of the yolks removed and pack into the 
space from which they were taken; roll each in 
a piece of paper napkin, twist the napkin at each 
end. A tbsp. of highly seasoned salad dressing

."iiiniMiiiiiiiMMriimiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiMiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiimiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii: 

Entrees are served before and after the heavy meat course. In such a place 
they are small and dainty, well flavored and often elaborately garnished. They 
may also serve as the main dish at family luncheons and suppers and frequently 
are the means of using to good advantage the left-overs of a previous meal. 

All the large variety of fritters, croquettes, souffles, timbales and aspics are 
listed as entrees. 

Material for entrees should be carefully prepared and well seasoned; the 
meat or fish should be chopped fine and all ingredients thoroughly mixed. 

Almost all entrees are served with an appropriate sauce and crisp bread. 
Patties should be served alone ; timbales usually with cream sauce and peas, mush- 
rooms or truffles; croquettes are usually served with peas. 

Forcemeat is used extensively in the making of garnishes and entrees. It 
consists of meat chopped fine, served separately or used as stuffing. 

Croquettes are well adapted for using any remnants of meat, fish or game 
and to make a savory dish from the more insipid vegetables. 

As meat and fish lose flavor in a second cooking, it is necessary to replenish 
this lack by using stock, cream or broth, either in the composition of the dish or 
as a sauce to serve with it. These sauces should be thoroughly cooked before the 
meat or fish is added; in order to avoid over-cooking of the protein substances. 



RECIPES 



Chicken Forcemeat — Chop, pound and rub 
through a sieve enough chicken meat to fill I cup- 
Boil together Yl cup fine stale bread crumbs, J/2 
blade of mace, and I cup cream until they are 
cooked to a smooth paste, about 10 minutes; then 
take from the fire; add 3 tbsp. butter, then the 
meat, Yl tbsp. salt and J/^ teasp. pepper. Beat 
whites of 3 eggs well and add to mixture. Test to 
make the texture right and set away to keep cool 
until wanted. 

Game and veal forcemeat are prepared in the 
same way. 

To test mixture, drop a small ball of it into a 
saucepan of boiling water and set back where it 
will not boil; cook for about 10 minutes. If it 
cuts smooth and fine all through and is tender, it 
is just right; if it should be tough, add 2 tbsp. 
cream to each cup of forcemeat; if, on the con- 
trary, the forcemeat ball is too soft and shrinks 
when cut, add 1 well beaten egg to every pint of 
the forcemeat. 

Liver Forcemeat — Put goose liver in hot water 
1 5 minutes, drain and cook slowly in salted water 
for 25 minutes, pound and rub through a sieve. 
Cook I cup bread crumbs in chicken stock, add 



1 teasp. salt, '/g teasp. pepper, blade of mace; com- 
bine with 3 cups liver, I cup butter, and 3 eggs 
well beaten; mix well together. 

Chicken, turkey or veal liver can be substituted. 

Oyster Forcemeat — Drain and wash I dozen 
large oysters, scald and strain the oyster liquor; 
chop the oysters very fine. Add 2 cups bread 
crumbs, 3 tbsp. butter, I teasp. salt, j/g teasp. 
pepper, 1 teasp. minced parsley, a grate of nutmeg, 
I tbsp. lemon juice, 3 tbsp. oyster juice, and 2 
raw egg yolks; pound to a smooth paste and rub 
through a sieve. 

Chicken Quenelles — Use Yl calf's brains, clean, 
tie in a piece of cheesecloth, and cook slowly for 
half an hour in well-seasoned stock. Cool and 
pound smooth, add to I chicken breast also 
chopped and pounded, and rub both through a 
sieve. Cook 2 tbsp. bread crumbs and Ya cup cream 
together until a smooth panada, add the meat with 
2 tbsp. butter, I teasp. salt, Yl teasp. lemon juice, 
grate of nutmeg, a few grains of pepper, and, 
lastly, I egg, and set away to cool. When ready 
to use, dip 2 teasp. in hot water, fill one spoon 
with the mixture and slip from one to the other 
until it is smooth and shaped like the bowl of the

spoon; slide on a buttered pan when all are formed, 
cover with boiling stock, and let cook below the 
boiling point for 1 minutes, keeping the dish 
covered with buttered paper. 

Quenelles of Grouse — Use half an anchovy, chop 
and pound with 1 cup meat, minced fine, and Yi 
cup bread crumbs. Add ^ teasp. chopped pars- 
ley, 2 tbsp. butter, 1 egg, {/^ teasp. salt, J/^ teasp. 
pepper, Yl clove garlic, and Yl teasp. lemon juice. 
Mix altogether carefully, cool and shape in balls 
the size of an egg. They may be poached and 
served with a Bechamel sauce or fried and served 
with any good brown or mushroom sauce. 

Lobster Quenelles — Pound to a paste the meat 
and coral of a lobster; mix with it 2 tbsp. bread 
crumbs and 6 tbsp. butter; add Yz teasp. salt, Y^ 
teasp. pepper, few grains cayenne, and moisten 
with 2 egg yolks and 1 egg white; if it proves too 
soft when tasted, add another white of egg; if too 
stifT, work in a little water. Shape and poach. 
Serve with Tartar sauce. 

If served hot, the sauce should be Bechamel. 

These may be cooled after poaching, fried in 
butter and served as a garnish for steamed fish, 
or in soup. 

Croquettes The excellence of croquettes de- 
pends upon three things : ( I ) The mixture must not 
be too thick. (2) It should be made some time 
before cooking, and, after rolling in eggs and fine 
crumbs, be set aside in a cold place to thicken. 
(3) The fat in which they are cooked must be 
boiling and deep enough to cover them. 

Eggs used for covering croquettes may be the 
whole egg or the whites only; never use the yolks 
alone. Beat the eggs until broken, not until light; 
add 1 tbsp. water for each white, or 2 tbsp. for 
a whole egg. Mix well before using. 

To Shape Croquettes — ^Take about a tbsp. of the 
mixture and with both hands shape in the form 
of a cylinder. Handle very gently and carefully. 
Pressure forces the particles apart, and thus breaks 
the form. Have a board sprinkled lightly with fine 
bread or cracker crumbs, and roll the croquettes 
very gently on this. The slightest pressure will 
break them, so let them lie on the board until all 
are finished, when, if any have become flattened, 
roll them into shape again. Beat an egg slightly 
and add I tbsp. water. Roll in egg and cracker 
crumbs and fry in deep fat a golden brown. 

Chicken Croquettes — Mix 2 cups of chopped 
cold fowl with Yl teasp. salt, few grains cayenne, 
1 teasp. lemon juice, J/^ teasp. onion juice, I teasp. 
chopped parsley, and combine with 1 cup white 
sauce. Shape, crumb, and fry in deep fat. Drain 
on soft paper. 



Chicken and Cornmeal Croquettes (Farmers' 
Bulletin 565, on "Cornmeal," U. S. Dept. of Agri.) 
— I cup white corn-meal mush, I cup chopped 
chicken, few drops onion juice, I egg, salt and 
pepper. 

Combine the ingredients and drop by spoon- 
fuls into hot fat. 

White corn-meal may be combined very satis- 
factorily with other kinds of cold meat to make 
croquettes. In general, corn-meal croquettes need 
not be egged and crumbed like ordinary croquettes, 
for the hardening of the corn-meal on the surface 
of the mixture forms the necessary crust. 

This serves three people. 

Chicken Croquettes with Mushrooms — Chop I 
cup cold cooked chicken and Yl <^3i> mushrooms 
or 6 large oysters fine. Melt 2 tbsp. butter, add 
3 tbsp. flour, mixed with Yl teasp. salt, Y^ teasp. 
pepper, and I teasp. lemon juice; then add slowly 
Yl cup chicken stock and Ya cup mushroom liquor. 
Cook until smooth and add Y^ cup cream. Com- 
bine with the meat and mushrooms. Cool, shape, 
and crumb. Fry in deep fat. Drain on brown 
paper. 

Royal Croquettes — Parboil I large sweetbread 
and I calf's brains; chop fine with meat of half 
a chicken ; add one egg, well beaten. Melt Ya cup 
butter, add 3 tbsp. flour, mixed with 1 teasp. 
chopped parsley, I teasp. salt and Y^ teasp. pepper; 
add cream or milk a little at a time until I cup 
is used, and cook until smooth. Combine mixture 
with the sauce and set aside to cool. Shape and 
roll twice in egg and in cracker crumbs and fry 
in deep fat. Drain on brown paper. 

Calf's Brains Croquettes — Parboil I small sweet- 
bread and 1 pair calf's brains; chop very fine 
with I can mushrooms; add Yl cup boiled rice 
and white sauce. Cool and shape into small rolls. 
Roll in fine crumbs, egg and crumbs again, and 
fry in deep fat. Drain on brown paper and serve. 

Beef and Rice Croquettes — Mince the meat fine, 
but not to make it pasty; add an equal amount of 
hot, boiled rice, cooked much softer than it is 
usually served for a vegetable. Season highly with 
salt, pepper, cayenne and onion juice and set to 
cool. If it is too stiff, work in a little stock or 
gravy. Drain on brown paper. 

Sweetbread Croquettes — Mix I teasp. salt, Yf> 
teasp. white pepper, a dust of nutmeg, Yl teasp. 
chopped parsley, I tbsp. lemon juice with 2 cups 
cooked and chopped sweetbreads and 4 tbsp. 
chopped mushrooms, and set aside to season while 
making a white sauce of 2 tbsp. butter, 2 tbsp. 
flour, and t cup cream. Add the meat to the sauce, 
and, lastly, 2 beaten eggs. Set away to cool or 
stiffen for 2 or 3 hours, then shape, crumb, and 
fry. Serve with mushroom, white sauce, or 
Bechamel yellow sauce.

chopped parsley, and let cool. \X'hen cold, (orm 
into balls, dip into beaten egg and bread crumbs, 
and fry in hot fat. Drain on brown paper. 

Shad roe may be used this v^ay instead of fish. 

If canned salmon is used, substitute bread crumbs 
for the potatoes and an extra egg, omitting the 
milk. 

Lobster Croquettes — Combine 2 cups finely 
chopped lobster with I teasp. salt, 1 teasp. mus- 
tard, few grains cayenne, and 1 cup white sauce. 
Cool, form into balls, roll in beaten egg and bread 
crumbs, and fry in hot fat. Drain on bro%vn paper. 

Oyster Croquettes — Drain and clean 1 cup raw 
oysters, scald and strain the liquor; chop the 
oysters very fine, soak 3 tbsp. cracker crumbs in 
the liquor; then mix with I cup cooked veal, 2 
tbsp. butter, 2 egg yolks, and 1 tbsp. onion juice. 
Shape, dip in egg and crumbs, and fry. Drain on 
bro^vn paper. 

Tile Fish Croquettes — Steam Yi lb. tile fish and 
separate in flakes. Melt I tbsp. butter, add 1 tbsp. 
flour; stir until blended; add Yl <:up milk, stirring

Cornmeal Fish Balls (Farmers" Bulletin 565, 
on "Cornmeal," U. S. Dept. of Agri.) — Two cups 
cold white corn-meal mush, I cup shredded cod- 
fish, I egg, I tbsp. butter. Pick over the codfish 
and soak it to remove salt, if necessary. Combine 
the ingredients, and drop by spoonfuls into hot fat. 
Drain on porous paper. These codfish balls com- 
pare very favorably in taste with those made with 
potato, and are prepared more easily and quickly. 
The mush must be as dry as possible. 

This makes 1 2 fish balls. 

Macaroni Croquettes — Boil J/^ 'b. macaroni in 
salted water until very tender. Drain, and put into 
saucepan with I heaped tbsp. butter, Yl °^* Par- 
mesan cheese, '/^ oz. cooked tongue cut in fine 
dice. Spread on a well-buttered platter, about an 
inch thick, cover with a buttered paper, press it 
well down, and set away to cool. Divide with the 
back of a knife into 6 parts, roll each one in 
grated cheese, then in beaten egg and crumbs. 
Fry in very hot fat till well browned. Drain and 
serve. 

Rice Croquettes — Beat 1 cup hot boiled rice with 
I teasp. sugar, I teasp. butter, Ya teasp. salt, I 



egg, and 2 tbsp. milk to the consistency of a firm 
paste. Shape into oval balls and dip in bread 
crumbs, beaten egg and again in bread crumbs. 
Fry in deep fat until brown, drain on soft paper. 
These are nice with a well-plumped raisin or a 
candied cherry pushed into the center before fry- 
ing. Serve with maple sauce. 

Potato Croquettes — Season hot mashed potatoes 
with salt and pepper and a little nutmeg; beat to 
a cream with I tbsp. melted butter and a few 
drops of onion juice; add 1 beaten egg yolk and

mixed, add salt and pepper to taste and 1 tbsp. 
finely chopped truffles. Then add, one at a time, 
the unbeaten whites of two eggs, mixing the first 
with the paste until it has disappeared before add- 
ing the second. Then beat whites of 2 more eggs 
to a stiff, dry froth and stir them carefully with 
the mixture. Fill greased timbale molds half full 
of the chicken paste, place them in a pan of hot 
water (the water should come up as far on the 
outside of the tins as the paste fills the inside). 
Bake in a moderately hot oven 20 or 30 minutes. 
Serve hot with a cream mushroom sauce.

Cheese being rich in protein takes the place of meat so far aa the actual 
nourishment of the body goes. It has more fat than meat and 25 percent more 
muscle-building substances, but it should be remembered that so concentrated a 
food is not a well balanced diet when eaten alone. It is more easily digested when 
grated or melted with a pinch of soda added, or cooked with other foods. It should 
be accompanied by bread, vegetables or fruits for bulk, mineral salts, and water. 

Cheese should be kept covered in a cool place. Old cheese may be grated 
and kept in a cool dry place. 

CHEESE AND ITS USE IN THE DIET 

(U. S. Farmers' Bulletin 487) 

Cheese is believed to be the oldest of the dairy products and the first form in which 
milk was preserved for future use. One may conjecture that it owes its origin to the acci- 
dental storing and ripening of sour milk curd. Although it has been a staple food with 
many races for uncounted years, there is a widespread belief that it is suitable for use chiefly 
in small quantities as an accessory to the diet, and that in large quantities it is likely to pro- 
duce physiological disturbances. We are inclined, therefore, to think of those who make 
cheese one of the chief articles of their diet as being driven to this course by necessity 
rather than being led to it by choice. 

Because of these opinions extensive studies have been carried on as a part of the De- 
partment Work in Home Economics, of the food value, thoroughness of digestibility, ease 
of digestion, physiological effect, and special character of cheese as food as well as of meth- 
ods which are followed in preparing it for the table. The conclusion drawn from this ex- 
tended study is, in brief, that cheese properly prepared and used is not generally a cause 
of physiological disturbances, and that it may easily be introduced into the bill of fare in 
such quantities as to serve as the chief source of nitrogenous food and may be made a sub- 
stitute for other nitrogenous foods when such substitution is desired. 

From the standpoint of the housekeeper, cheese is of importance because of its high 
nutritive value, particularly its high percentage of protein or muscle-forming materials, be- 
cause of the ease with which it can be kept and prepared for the table, and because of its 
appetizing flavor and of the great variety of ways in which it can be served. 



There is something to be said of the value of 
cheese to that not inconsiderable number of indi- 
viduals who must occasionally cater for themselves 
— those men and w^omen in business life, for ex- 
ample, who find it convenient neither to carry 
lunches nor to go to restaurants. For these, cheese 
offers a convenient ^vay of supplying the necessary 
protein, for it can usually be obtained in good con- 
dition in any neighborhood. Combined with 
crackers, some of the ready-cooked cereals, or 



bread, and with fruit, it makes a fairly well-bal- 
anced meal. 

The average cheese while fresh and moist con- 
tains proteids and fat in much the same ratio as 
that in which they are found in the milk. More 
that one-fourth its weight is proteid, about one- 
third fats, and one-third water. There are always 
present small amounts of albumen and sugar which 
have clung to the curd. Owing to the addition 
of salt, the percentage of mineral matter is high 
compared with that of most other foods. 



1 80 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Sec. IV— Pt. 2— COOKING AND RECIPES 



THE CARE OF CHEESE IN THE HOME 

One of the best ways of keeping cheese which 
has been cut is to wrap it in a slightly damp cloth 
and then in paper, and to keep it in a cool place. 
To dampen the cloth, sprinkle it and then wring it. 
It should seem hardly damp to the touch. Paraffin 
paper may be used in place of the cloth. When 
cheese is put in a covered dish, the air should 
never be wholly excluded, for if this is done, it 
molds more readily. 

In some markets it is possible to buy small whole 
cheeses. These may be satisfactorily kept by cut- 
ting a slice from the top, to serve as a cover, and 
removing the cheese as needed with a knife, a 
strong spoon, or a cheese scoop. 

CHEESE AS A FOOD 

Cheese is used in general in two vrays — in 
small quantities chiefly for its flavor, and in large 
quantities for its nutritive value as well as for its 
flavor. Some varieties of cheese are used chiefly 
for the first purpose, others chiefly for the second. 
Those which are used chiefly for their flavor, many 
of which are high priced, contribute little to the 
food value of the diet, because of the small quan- 
tity used at a time. They have an important part 
to play, however, in making the diet attractive and 
palatable. 

Those cheeses which are suitable to be eaten in 
large quantities and which are comparatively low 
priced are important not only from the point of 
viewr of flavor, but also from the point of view of 
their nutritive value. Among such cheeses the one 
which, as noted above, is known to the trade as 
standard factory cheese and to the housewife as 
American cheese stands out pre-eminently. There- 
fore, when the word "cheese" is used without 
specification in the following pages it may be taken 
to refer to this particular variety. 

The liking for highly flavored cheeses of strong 
odor is a matter of individual preference, but from 
the chemist's standpoint there is no reason for the 
statement often made that such cheeses have under- 
gone putrefactive decomposition. 

COMPOSITION OF CHEESE AND SOME 
OTHER FOODS COMPARED 

In the present state of our knowledge concern- 
ing dietetics, it seems best to give the housekeeper 
general rather than absolute rules with respect to 
the kind and amount of food which should be eaten 
at any meal or at any given time by persons in 
normal health living under usual conditions. It is 
not necessary, therefore, for the housekeeper to 
knovr the exact composition of food materials in 
order to cater well for her family, a rough approxi- 
mation being sufficient for the purpose. In the case 
of cheese, she will be near enough to the fact if 
she thinks of it as composed approximately of 
equal parts by weight of proteids, fats, and water. 
This rough conception is sufficient to associate it 



in her mind with the foods of high proteid value, 
a point which is important in connection with the 
making of bills of fare. It should lead her to class 
it also with the foods which are rich in fat and 
prevent her from combining it unnecessarily with 
other fatty foods. 

The total amount of the mineral matter needed 
per day by the body is relatively small, yet mineral 
matter is very important. It is commonly assumed 
and is probably true, that a mixed diet reasonably 
varied and reasonably generous will supply all the 
ash constituent which the body requires. If for 
any reason calcium and phosphorus are lacking in 
the diet, the amounts may be readily increased by 
a free use of milk and such milk products as cheese 
and junket, without decreasing the palatability of 
the diet or materially increasing its cost. 

Since cheese is ready to be eaten when it comes 
from the market, it may be more interesting for 
some purposes to compare its composition Vfith 
that of cooked beef, freed from bone and from 
superfluous fat, such a piece as would be served 
to a person at the table. Weight for weight, cheese 
has appreciably more protein than such cooked 
beef, and 50 per cent, more fat. 

THE DIGESTIBILITY OF CHEESE 

As was stated above, cheese has been thought a 
cause of digestive disturbances, but work recently 
done by the Office of Elxperiment Stations, in co- 
operation with the Bureau of Animal Industry, and 
briefly summed up in a recent publication, tends 
to disprove this. 

The statement refers to full-cream cheese. Ex- 
periments made at the same time gave practically 
the same values for the digestibility of skim-milk 
cheese, of Swiss cheese, of Roquefort and Camem- 
bert cheese, and of cottage cheese. 

The burning sensation or similar sensations some- 
times experienced after eating certain sorts of 
cheese has been attributed to the presence of small 
amounts of free fatty acids. It is commonly said 
that cheese is difficult to digest, the idea being that 
the body expends more labor in assimilating it than 
is required for other comparable foods. Experi- 
ments recently carried on by the Office of Experi- 
ment Stations, in which the respiration calorimeter 
was used to study the energy expenditure during 
the period of active digestion, do not indicate that 
cheese differs materially in ease of digestion from 
a comparable amount of meat. Uncooked full- 
cream cheese was used in these experiments. 
Another series recently begun by the Office of 
Experiment Stations with cooked cheese, though 
not yet sufficiently advanced to be conclusive, in- 
dicates that cheese thus eaten does not differ ma- 
terially from raw cheese in this respect. 

In connection with the use of cooked cheese in 
the diet, one fact should always be kept in mind. 
This is that, in common with all other fatty foods, 
cheese which has been overheated in cooking is 



CLASS 1 4— SAVORIES— CHEESE 



181 



likely to contain burned — that is, decompoaed — 
fats. Disturbances from this cause, however, should 
be laid to poor cooking and not to the composition 
of this special food. 

Curds and Whey 

Cheese curds and whey, an old-fashioned dish, 
which is often spoken of in accounts of life in 
earlier times, sometimes refers to sour-milk curd 
and sometimes to curd separated with rennet. This 
dish, when made with rennet, is much like junket 
and though far less common today than was once 
the case, is wholesome and palatable. 

Cottage Cheese 

This cheese is very commonly prepared in the 
home, and the process of making it is very simple. 
It consists merely of curdling the milk, separating 
the curd from the whey, seasoning, and pressing it. 

The curd is formed by the souring of the milk, 
and the process is hastened if the milk is kept warm, 
the best temperature being about blood heat, 96 
degrees F. A temperature much above this should 
be avoided, as the curd is likely to become hard 
and tough if much heated. The danger is usually 
not that the whole will be overheated but that the 
portion nearest the fire will be. In the old-fash- 
ioned kitchen there was usually a place where the 
milk could stand till it was uniformly warm through- 
out. With our present cooking arrangenients it 
is often desirable to hasten the process. This may 
be done by setting the milk into a pan of warm 
water or by pouring hot water directly into the 
milk itself. The effect of the latter method is to 
remove much more of the acid than when the 
whey is left undiluted. Some consider this a great 
advantage. 

If, for any reason, the curd is overheated, it 
should be put through a meat chopper. This will 
insure cottage cheese of excellent texture. 

If the milk is thoroughly chilled before the whey 
is drained off it retains more of the fat than if 
this is done when warm. Under no circumstances, 
however, is much of the fat retained in cottage 
cheese. It is therefore more economical to make 
it out of skim milk and to add the fat to the curd 
in the form of butter or cream. 

Chopped parsley, caraway seeds, chopped olives, 
and pimiento may all be used for flavoring if such 
flavored cheese is preferred to plain cottage cheese. 

Cottage cheese is most commonly consumed 
immediately, but if made in quantity for commer- 
cial purposes, it may be packed in tubs and placed 
in cold storage. Sometimes it is formed into rolls 
or blocks and wrapped in tinfoil when marketed. 
Such cheese is used without ripening. 

Though cottage cheese is usually made by allow- 
ing the milk to sour naturally, it is sometimes more 
convenient to curdle the milk by adding rennet, 
and some housekeepers have a preference for cot- 



tage cheese thus made, since the flavor is milder 
and the acid taste which it possesses when made 
from sour milk is lacking. 

Sour-Cream Cheese 

When cream is to be made into cheese similar 
to cottage cheese, it should be drained without 
having previously been heated. The drainage is 
facilitated by moistening the cloth in salt water be- 
fore the cream is poured in. The curd is formed 
either by souring or by the addition of rennet. 

Uncooked Curd, or French CotUge Cheese 

The French make cheese from sour milk without 
heating it. They pour the milk into earthen molds 
which have holes in the bottom. A very fine sieve 
may be used instead of the molds. The whey 
drips out and the curd assumes a custardlike con- 
sistency and takes the shape of the mold. When 
sufficiently stiff, the cheese is chilled, and is eaten 
with sweet cream and sugar. It is a staple dessert 
m many French families, especially in hot weather, 
and is delicious served with acid fruit, such as cur- 
rants, or with strawberries. 

Junket 

If cottage cheese is made from sweet milk and 
rennet and served without breaking and separating 
the curd and whey, the dish is called junket. It 
is customary to season it a little, as with grated 
nutmeg or with cinnamon and sugar. 

Buttermilk Cheese 

At the Wisconsin Experiment Station a method 
has been devised for making a soft, moist cheese 
out of buttermilk. When made on a large scale, 
as it might be in creameries, there are various pre- 
cautions to be taken, which are pointed out in the 
publication cited. In making it in small quantities, 
these precautions are unnecessary, and the method 
is even simpler than that of making cottage cheese, 
because the quality does not depend so much on 
the temperature. 

To make the buttermilk cheese, heat buttermilk 
gradually to about 130 or 140 degrees F. Allow 
it to cool, and strain it. As the curd will settle to 
the bottom, most of the whey may be poured off 
before the draining is begun. 

This cheese is, of course, almost wholly without 
fat, and yet — probably because the particles of 
curd are very finely divided it has a smooth con- 
sistency, which suggests the presence of fat. It may 
be served seasoned with salt only, or it may be 
mixed with butter or cream and seasonings. It is 
suitable for combining with olives and pimientoa, 
or for any use to which the ordinary cream cheeses 
are put. 

Buttermilk Cream 

This product also was devised by the Wisconsin 
Elxperiment Station. By controlling the tempera- 
ture in heating the buttermilk and not allowing it 



1 82 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Sec. IV— Pt. 2— COOKING AND RECIPES 



to go above 100 degrees F., a compound is made 
which after draining has the consistency of a very 
thick cream. It is claimed by the station investi- 
gators that this "cream" is suitable for eating on 
bread in place of butter. 

Devonshire Cream 

Devonshire cream somewhat resembles sweet 
cream in flavor and consistency. It is very much 
liked in England, where it is commonly eaten with 
fresh or preserved fruit, but is not so well known 
in America. 



To make Devonshire cream, allow a pan of whole 
milk to stand for 24 hours in a cool place, or for 
12 hours in a wrarmer place. Place the pan on 
the cooler part of the stove and heat until the milk 
is very hot, but not to the boiling point. If heated 
too much, a thick skin will form on the surface. 
The more slo^vly the milk is heated the better. 
f-Iaving been heated, the milk should be kept in 
a cool place for 24 hours and then skimmed. TTie 
thick cream obtained has a characteristic flavor and 
texture.

FOOD VALUE OF SALADS 

(Iowa State College of Agriculture) 

A well prepared salad is an excellent food. Salads supply water, mineral 
salts, acids, cellulose and flavor to the diet. 

The ingredients should be fresh and cold and it should be pleasing in appear- 
ance as well as flavor. 

A great variety of materials are used in salads: fruits, green and cooked 
vegetables, eggs, meat, fish, cheese, nuts, etc. 

Green vegetables should be crisp, cold and dry when served. If water is 
left on the leaves the salad and salad dressing will be poor in flavor. 

Salad dressing should be added just before time of serving as the salad ma- 
terial wilts if allowed to stand after the dressing has been added. 

VALUE IN DIET 
Fruits and Vegetables 

1. Supply water. 4. Supply cellulose. 

2. Supply mineral salts. 5. Supply flavor. 

3. Supply acids. 6. Supply variety. 
Salad vegetables often contain 90 per cent, or 

more of water, which in itself is useful in the 
system in many ways. 

They furnish only a small quantity of protein, 
which varies from 1.5 to 4 per cent. In addition, 
they contain cellulose, chlorophyll, sugars, gum, 
pectin and sometimes a little fat.

REMEMBER 

Vegetables should be carefully dried and exposed 
to the air for a few minutes before adding the 
dressing, as water and oil do not mix. 

Salads dressed at the table should first be sprin- 
kled w^ith salt and pepper, then oil added, and, 
lastly, vinegar or lemon juice. 

A salad is perfectly dressed w^hen each individual 
leaf or bit of vegetable is lightly coated with oil 
or appropriate dressing. 



MAKING SALADS 



The first step in making a good salad is to have good materials, fresh, crisp 
vegetables raw or carefully cooked, good oil and vinegar. Prepare these w^ith care, 
wash and dry green stuff, drain and cut up cooked vegetables or meats in attrac- 
tive diced pieces put away to cool. Either make the dressing and put on ice, or 
mix it at table, or use one of the excellent bottled dressings now sold at all good 
food shops. But remember never toss up the salad with the dressing until just be- 
fore serving. 

Salads made of minced meat, vegetables and dressing are not dinner salads 
when meat is the main dish, but should be used rather for supper or light luncheon. 

Fruit combines with nuts and lettuce and dressing hold all the food value 
of a meat salad and are a refreshing substitute for meat at a mid luncheon. 

When fresh green vegetables are not obtainable there are always the care- 
fully canned asparagus, peas, etc., and when fresh fruit is rare the delicious canned 
pineapple, pears, grapes, etc., are on the market. 

Canned meats and even raisins and nuts offer endless opportunities for a 
good salad. 

All salads depend largely on the dressing. Fruit salads are better with a rich 
mayonnaise or a butter and cream dressing with a dash of sugar. The vegetable 
salads need a more highly seasoned French dressing and no sugar. 

Meat salads may take either a French dressing or mayonnaise without su- 
gar and seasoned with the meat's appropriate sauce. For beef use a bit of grated 
horseradish; pork or ham. Chili sauce; lamb, chopped capers; veal or fish, tomato 
mayonnaise or a few drops of catsup; fowl, plain mayonnaise. 

Pure salad oil has a faint nutty odor when it has any at all, is pale green in 
color and tastes somewhat like the ripe olives from which it is made. It should 
blend easily with condiments. 

RECIPES 



Mayonnaise Dressing — The secret of success 
with mayonnaise is to have the dish, beater and 
materials ice cold, to work quickly, and place at 
once on ice. 

Stir into yolk of 1 egg, a mixture of Yi teasp. 
mustard, Yi teasp. salt, 1 teasp. sugar, dash of 
paprika and cayenne. Beat thoroughly and stead- 
ily, adding drop by drop I cupful olive oil. When 
dressing is stiff, thin slowly with 1 tbsp. lemon 
juice, then 1 tbsp. vinegar. Should oil not thicken 
egg at once, add !4 teasp. unbeaten white of egg 
or a few drops of vinegar will make it smooth 



again. It should be thick enough to cut with a 
spoon before adding rest of vinegar. Put on ice. 
When salad is ready to serve, mix in lightly only 
small portion of mayonnaise; drop the remainder 
on top. 

Colored Mayonnaise — Green mayonnaise is made 
by adding the juice from a small quantity of 
mashed spinach or parsley. Strain through cheese- 
cloth before putting it in the mayonnaise dressing. 

To color it red, add beet juice or juice of lobster 
cOTal,

Tomato Mayonnaise — Stew gently 3 cups canned 
• trained tomato; mash, strain, add Yi teasp. butter, 
Yl teasp. flour, blended. Simmer until very thick, 
add I tbsp. powdered sugar. This is tomato purea 
and can be bought canned. Fold this puree into 
Yl cup stiff mayonnaise. This is delicious with 
meat or fish salads. 

Marinade is used to express the seasoning of 
salad to taste with salt, pepper, oil or vinegar. 

French Dressing — Mix 4 tbsp. oil slowly into 
the dry seasonings of Yl teasp. salt, 1/4 teasp. pep- 
per, Ya teasp. onion juice; add 1 tbsp. vinegar. 

Boiled Salad Dressing — Into 2 beaten eggs stir 
1/3 cupful vinegar with water added to make Yl 
cupful; add I teasp. sugar, 1 teasp. salt, Yl teasp. 
mustard, dash of paprika. Beat thoroughly, put 
in double boiler, add 1 tbsp. melted butter, cook, 
stirring until smooth and creamy. This will keep 
on ice a week. 

Sour Cream Dressing Mix Yl teasp. salt, !4 

teasp. mustard, Y^ teasp. pepper, I teasp. sugar. 
Stir into 1 beaten egg. Put on in double boiler. 
Add at once slowly I tbsp. vinegar thinned with 
I tbsp. warm water. As it heats add 1 teasp. 
butter rubbed in I tbsp. flour; stir carefully until 
smooth and thick. Remove and chill. When ready 
to serve, thin with sour cream. 

Condensed Milk Dressing — Beat slowly into Yl 
cup olive oil yolks of 2 eggs. Add I cup vinegar 
into which 1 teasp. mustard, Yl teasp. salt have 
been mixed; carefully stir in Yl can condensed 
milk and the stiff whites of the eggs; put on ice 
until used. 

Cheese Salad Dressing — Into Ya 'b. grated 
American or Roquefort cheese mix the following: 
1 tbsp. olive oil, Yl teasp. cayenne pepper, I 
teasp. salt, 1 teasp. powdered sugar, Ya teasp. 
mustard. When well blended, thin with 4 tbsp. 
vinegar or 2 tbsp. lemon juice and olive oil to suit. 

This is a nice dressing for fish, potato, or green 
vegetable salads. 

Horseradish Cream Dressing — Mix '/i teasp. 
mustard and cayenne, Yl teasp. salt, Yl teasp. 
sugar, 1 teasp. grated horseradish, 1 tbsp. lemon 
juice. Chill. Just before serving, fold this into 
Yl cup whipped cream. 

Salmon Salad (Canned) Chop the salmon well 

with a fork, add a little chopped onion if desired 
and mix with French or mayonnaise dressing and 
serve on lettuce leaves. 

Canned tuna fish, or any boiled or baked fish 
when cold, can be treated this way. 

. Macaroni and Fish Salad — Either macaroni, 
spaghetti or rice may be used with cold canned 
or fresh cooked fish. 



Boil broken macaroni or rice in salted water un- 
til tender; rinse, drain, chill. Into a bowl lined 
with lettuce leaves or chickory, place in layers 
the macaroni and I cup flaked fish, sprinkling in 
between Yl tbsp. chopped parsley. When ready 
to serve, pour over all tomato mayonnaise or a 
plam French dressing. Garnish with sliced tomato 
or cucumber. 

Shell Fish Salad — Lobster, crab, shrimp, or 
oyster may be used. Boil, shell and pick out meat 
and chop into dice; if oysters are used, cut in two. 
Use 1/3 as much celery as meat, cut in small bits, 
chill. Mix in a bowl, sprinkle with salt, stir in 
mayonnaise. Serve on lettuce with plain or 
tomato mayonnaise. 

If omitting the celery, mix with pulp of scooped 
out fresh tomato and return to tomato. Serve with 

dressing. 

With vegetable salads it is sometimes well to use 
as a body for the salad either potatoes sliced thin, 
cooked rice, each grain separated, or well dried 
macaroni cut in inch pieces. 

Some kinds of vegetables combine better than 
others, as beans, peas, cauliflower, tender carrots, 
asparagus, and again turnips with beets, carrots, 
cabbage and tomatoes. 

Mixed Vegetable Salad — Use firm boiled potatoes 
sliced thin; slice cucumbers and fresh tomatoes. 
Mince and marinate separately 1 Spanish onion, 
I green pepper, 2 tbsp. crisp cabbage. Arrange 
sliced vegetables on lettuce leaves, sprinkle over 
them the minced marinated ones. Dress with an 
oil salad dressing to which a drop or two of tobasco 
is added. 

Mashed Potato Salad — To 4 mealy boiled pota- 
toes, mashed, mix the mashed yolks of 4 hard 
boiled eggs seasoned with Yl teasp. salt, !4 teasp. 
paprika; add a few chopped gherkins, I small 
minced onion and lightly fold in a cooked salad 
dressing. Serve in a bed of lettuce. Garnish with 
chopped parsley and sliced hard whites. 

Potato Salad with Eggs — Put a layer of sliced 
cold boiled potatoes on lettuce leaves in a bowj 
rubbed with onion juice. Arrange in layers above 
them either sliced cucumbers or hard boiled eggs. 
Sprinkle each layer with seasonings of Yl teasp. 
salt, !4 teasp. pepper, Yl cup diced celery mixed 
with I cup boiled dressing. When serving do not 
mash; lift salad out lightly with fork. 

Potato Salad — Pare and boil potatoes; chop fine 
when cold, season with raw onion sliced thin. 
Make a dressing of yolks of 3 hard boiled eggs, 
mashed fine, salt and mustard to taste; then add 
enough olive oil or melted butter to make a paste, 



1 88 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Sec. IV— Pt. 2— COOKING AND RECIPES 



mixing thoroughly; to this add 1 cup vinegar 
gradually, beat well with the paste and mix with 
potatoes. 

Plain Egg Salad — Press hard boiled egg yolks 
through a ricer. Place sliced whites on lettuce and 
chickory, sprinkle the riced yolks over, then salt 
and pepper, and, last, drop on some creamy salad 
dressing. 

Egg and Cream Cheese Salad — Mix yolks of hard 
boiled eggs with equal amount cream cheese, few 
grains cayenne, salt, chopped nuts. Mold flat with 
hand. Cut with silver knife into strips 3 inches 
long, 1/2 inch wide. Lay two strips on a lettuce 
leaf for each place; drop mayonnaise in space 
between strips, or if too rich pour over a French 
dressing. Garnish with hard whites, sliced. 



Lettuce Salad — Have ready a salad spoon and 
fork, a small bowl, vinegar, oil, salt and pepper, 
and a large bowl of crisp cold lettuce. Into the 
chilled bowl, rubbed inside with garlic, mix I teasp. 
salt, !4 teasp. pepper, with 1 tbsp. vinegar, 3 tbsp. 
oil; stir until thoroughly blended. Pour over the 
lettuce, tossing lightly and quickly with salad fork 
and spoon. Serve at once with cheese wafers. 

Many prefer to mix their own salad dressing at 
the table, especially for simple lettuce salad. 

Tomato and Lettuce SeJad — Drop whole toma- 
toes an instant into boiling water, peel, cool on 
ice, slice. Serve on lettuce with or without sliced 
cucumbers. Drop on top spoonfuls of stiff mayon- 
naise.

many fresh tomatoes as required. To half the 
pulp add the same quantity of this mixture: 
minced ham or roast pork, a few chopped olives, 
and a dash of Chili sauce; stir in French dressing, 
fill tomatoes, put on ice. Serve the stuffed toma- 
toes in a cup-shaped leaf of watercress on indi- 
vidual plates, with a spoonful of seasoned whipped 
cream over each. 

Stuffed Cucumber Salad — Select small cucum- 
bers, peel, cut in lengthwise halves, put in cold 
salted water 1 hour. Remove pulp, mix with 
chopped celery or cabbage, olives, anchovies and 
either chopped blanched nut meats or cooked

STRUCTURE AND COMPOSITION OF VEGETABLES 

By Maria Parloa. 

(U. S. Farmers' Bulletin No. 256) 

Plants are made up of innumerable cells, each consisting of a thin mem- 
branous wall inclosing a semifluid mass, in which lie the nucleus or center of cell 
activity and minute grains of starch or other material which the plant has elaborated. 

The wrhole framework of the very young plants is made up of these cell 
walls, commonly called cellular tissue or cellulose. However, early in the growth 
of the plant wood cells begin to develop. The wood cells grow into a fibrous sub- 
stance that may be torn apart like threads, w^hich is called woody fiber. It is this 
woody fiber and the thickening and hardening of the cellular tissue that make poor- 
ly grown or stale vegetables hard and indigestible. 

Practically all green plants contain a large percentage of water v^^ith a larger 
or smaller percentage of starch and some nitrogenous material (protein), sugar, 
gum, crude fiber, and other carbohydrate and mineral matter. The fruits and seeds 
of some plants are rich in fat, but the plant itself rarely contains any appreciable 
amount of this constituent. 

Most vegetables contain small amounts of volatile essential oils or other 
bodies of pronounced flavor and owe their characteristic taste to such constitu- 
ents; sugars and acids when present, as they often are, and mineral salts, found in 
all vegetable foods, also contribute their share toward the flavor. 

CLASSIFICATION OF VEGETABLES. 

Vegetable foods may be divided into a fe^v general classes. These are cereals, leg- 
umes, tubers, roots and bulbs, herbaceous or green vegetables, and vegetable fruits and 
flowers. The cereals are the most valuable of the vegetable foods, including as they do 
the grains from which is made nearly all the bread of the world. The use of cereals for 
bread making, for breakfast foods, and in similar ways is taken up elsewhere. In this bulle- 
tin rice and corn are the only cereals considered, as they are the only grains commonly em- 
ployed as table vegetables. 

Rice is largely composed of starch and has very small proportions of nitrogenous, 
fatty, and mineral matter. Therefore, when used as a vegetable, it is naturally and very 
properly served with foods rich in the constituents which it lacks. 

Legumes belong to the pulse family. The fruit is usually in the shape of a pod. Al- 
though there are several thousand species of the Leguminosae or pulse, only a few kinds 
are used as table vegetables, beans, peas, cowpeas, and lentils being the legumes princi- 
pally employed as human food. The dried seeds of beans, peas, and lentils constitute a 
most valuable all-the-year-round food supply. The seeds occupy small space, keep well, and 
may be prepared in a great many appetizing and nutritious forms. 

191 



1 92 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Sec. IV— Pt. 2— COOKING AND RECIPES . 

The ripe leguminous seeds are very rich in nitrogenous matter. Peas, beans, cow- 
peas, and lentils contain on an average 25 per cent nitrogenous matter and over 50 per cent 
starch, and about 1 per cent cellulose, fatty matter, and mineral matter. When properly 
cooked and consumed in reasonable quantities peas, beans, and lentils may replace a portion 
of the meat in the daily dietary. The unripe legumes and their edible pods, like all green 
vegetables, are quite succulent foods, the proportion of nutritive material being small as 
compared with the water present. 

Since the fatty matter in the legumes enumerated does not average 3 per cent they 
are commonly and wisely cooked with some added fat. The green seeds and the green 
pods of peas and beans are not so highly nutritious as the dried seed, but they are more 
delicate and apparently more easily digested. Ki 

Among the foods served as table vegetables, tubers and roots have an important 
place. The potato comes next to the cereals in its almost universal employment and the 
material consumed. We have no other vegetable that lends itself to such a variety of pre- 
parations. The potato contaiins a large percentage of water, a fair percentage of starch, a 
very small percentage of sugar, and nitrogenous, fatty, and gummy matter, and about 1 per 
cent of mineral matter. The mineral matter consists of potash and soda salts, citrates, 
phosphates, magnesia, and silicate of lime, it is to this mineral matter that the potato owes 
its antiscorbutic properties. 

The sweet potato is rich in starch and sugar. The percentage of nitrogenous eind 
fatty matter is very small. This vegetable makes a pleasant and healthful addition to the 
table. It is somewhat Izixative. 

The true roots most used as table vegetables are beets, radish, turnips, parsnips, 
carrots, salsify, and celeriac. Both the parsnip and salsify withstand frost and may be left 
in the ground all winter, thus making it possible to have these vegetables in the early spring 
as well cis in the fall. However, they must not be left in the ground too late in the season 
the following spring, as they soon grow hard and fibrous. Turnips, beets, and carrots, for 
summer and fall use, should be of the quick- growing kind, and should not be allowed to 
grow to great size. To have these vegetables in perfection it is necessary to sow them fre- 
quently during the season. When grown for winter use, these roots, like all vegetables that 
are to be stored, must, of course, develop until mature, else they will not keep well. 

The bulb-bearing plants belong to the lily family, the onion being the bulb most 
generally used as a vegetable and flavorer. On the Continent of Europe very many other 
members of the onion family are also freely used as flavorers, and no continental kitchen 
garden would be considered complete without several varieties, such as the common onion, 
leek, shallot, garlic, chives, and cibol. Much of the delicious flavor of the French and 
Italian cookery is due to the skillful combination of several of the onion flavors. 

The herbaceous vegetables, cabbage, lettuce, celery, spinach, etc., are valuable for 
their refreshing qualities, the salts they yield, and the variety they give to our diet, but owing 
to the amount of water they contain (90 per cent or more on an average) their food value 
is low. The leaves, stems, and shoots are the parts used as food. These vegetables should 
be employed while young and tender; the more rapidly the vegetables grow the more ten- 
der they will be. 

Fruits used as vegetables include tomatoes, okra, squash, pumpkin, cucumber, egg- 
plant, and peppers, among others. Such fruits as muskmelon and watermelon are used as 
fruits rather than as vegetables, and are not taken up here. In the case of globe or French 
artichoke, cauliflower, and broccoli the flower buds or inflorescence are the parts eaten. 



CLASS 1 6— VEGETABLES— PREPARATION 193 

GENERAL PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING VEGETABLE COOIONG. 

Vegetables are baked, roasted, fried, or boiled, are used for making a great variety 
of dishes, and are prepared for the table in other ways; but the most common method of 
cooking them is in boiling water. Steaming is not infrequently resorted to as a method of 
cooking vegetables and is, of course, similar in principle to boiling in water. 

The simpler the methods of cooking and serving vegetables the better. A properly 
grown and well-cooked vegetable will be palatable and readily digestible. Badly cooked, 
water-soaked vegetables very generally cause digestive disturbances, which are often seri- 
ous. Nearly every vegetable may be cooked so that with plain bread it may form a pala- 
table course by itself, if it is desired to serve it in this manner. 

All green vegetables, roots, and tubers should be crisp and firm when put on to cook. 
If for any reason a vegetable has lost its firmness and crispiness, it should be soaked in very 
cold water until it becomes plump and crisp. With new vegetables this will be only a mat- 
ter of minutes, while old roots and tubers often require many hours. All vegetables should 
be thoroughly cleaned just before being put on to cook. Vegetables that form in heads, 
such as cabbage, cauliflower, and Brussels sprouts, should be soaked, heads turned do'wn, 
in salted cold water, to which a few spoonfuls of vinegar may be added. If there are any 
worms or other forms of animal life in these vegetables, they will crawl out. To secure 
the best results all vegetables except the dried legumes must be put in boiling water, and 
the water must be made to boil again as soon as possible after the vegetables have been 
added, and must be kept boiling until the cooking is finished. Herbaceous vegetables 
should boil rapidly all the time. With tubers, roots, cauliflower, etc., the ebullition should 
not be so violent as to break the vegetables. Green beans and peas when removed from 
the pod must also be cooked gently, i. e., just simmer. When the pods and all are used 
they are to be cooked rapidly, like the herbaceous vegetables. 

To secure the most appetizing and palatable dishes, only fresh, tender vegetables 
should be cooked. If, however, green beans, peas, etc., have grown until a little too old 
and it still seems best to gather them, a very small piece of baking soda added to the 
water in w^hich they are boiled makes them more tender, it is commonly believed, and helps 
to retain the color. Too much soda injures the flavor, and an excess must be carefully 
avoided. A little soda may also be used to advantage if the water is quite hard. Peas 
may be boiled for fifteen or twenty minutes in the water to which the soda has been added, 
then to be cooked the same as peas w^ith pork. 

During the cooking of all vegetables the cover must be drawn to one side of the 
stewpan to allow the volatile bodies liberated by the heat to pass off in the steam. All vege- 
tables should be thoroughly cooked, but the cooking should stop while the vegetable is still 
firm. This, of course, does not apply to vegetables that are cooked in soups, purees (thick 
strained soups), etc. The best seasoning for most vegetables is salt and good butter. 
Vegetables that are blanched and then cooked with butter and other seasonings 3md very 
little moisture are more savory and nutritious than when all the cooking is done in a good 
deal of clear water. 

BLANCHING VEGETABLES AS A COOKING PROCESS. 

Blanching, which in cookery in entirely different from the bleaching or blanching 
of green vegetables in the garden, is a cooking process often used with vegetables, since 
it removes the strong or acrid taste and improves the quality. It is also convenient, since 
blanching may be done at any time, and the cooking completed in a very short time when 
the dish is to be served. 

Have a large stewpeui half full of rapidly boiling water. Add a tablespoonful of 
salt for every 2 quarts of water. Have the vegetables cleaned and well drained. Drop 



194 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Sec. IV— Pt. 2— COOKING AND RECIPES 

them into the boiling water, and bring the water back to the boiling point as quickly as 
possible. Boil rapidly, with the cover partially or wholly off the stewpan, five to twenty 
minutes, depending upon the vegetable, then drain off the water. If the cooking of the 
vegetable is not to be finished at once,, pour cold water over the vegetable to cool 
it quickly, then drain and set aside until needed. If the cooking is to be continued 
at once, it will not be necessary to rinse the vegetable with cold water. To com- 
plete the cooking the vegetable should be put in a small stewpan with butter or drip- 
pings and the other seasonings and cooked gently until done. A few spoonfuls of 
liquid will be required for every quart of very juicy vegetables, and half a pint of liquid for 
drier vegetables. The stewpan is to be covered, only a slight opening being left for ven- 
tilation. All vegetables cooked in this manner should be cut up rather small either before 
or after the blanching. 

LOSSES IN COOKING VEGETABLES. 

In baking vegetables there is little loss of material except the water which is driven 
off by the heat. When vegetables are immersed in water, as in boiling, a greater or less 
loss of material is almost inevitable, the kind and amount of material extracted by the 
water depending upon such factors as the sort of water used, its temperature at the begin- 
ning and during the cooking period, the length of time the cooking is continued, and the 
condition of the vegetable, that is, whether pared, whole, or cut into small pieces. 

INDIAN CORN. 

(U. S. Farmers' Bulletin 559) 

Indian corn is peculiarly an American product, being native to American soil. 
The ways of preparing it for human food are very numerous, and many of them, 
like the cereal itself, are of Indian origin. 

COMPOSITION OF INDIAN CORN 

The varieties of Indian corn are many, white and yellovir types being very 
common, red not uncommon, and even blue and black corn being found in the 
southwestern United States. There is a widespread popular belief that the food 
value of these different sorts varies as greatly as their color, but this is not the 
case. White, yellow, red, blue, and black corn Eire very much alike in composition, 
and are therefore equally valuable as sources of nourishment. They vary some- 
what, however, in flavor. The liking for one or another is a personal or local matter. 

COMPARISON OF DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE KERNEL. 

The percentage composition of Indian corn as given above is that of the whole kernel 
as distinguished from any of its parts. A grain of corn is complex in structure, eoid its 
different parts vary greatly in nutritive value. For our purpose here it may be considered 
to consist of skin, germ, and endosperm. The skin constitutes about 6 per cent of the 
whole weight of the kernel; the germ, which contains the embryo, from which under fav- 
orable conditions new life will spring, constitutes about 10 per cent; and the endosperm, 
which is the storehouse of food for the new life, constitutes about 84 per cent. Of the 
total amount of crude fiber in a kernel of com, 51 per cent is in the skin; of the starch, 
90 per cent is in the endosperm; and of the protein, 80 per cent is in the endosperm and 
16 per cent in the germ; while of the fat, 65 per cent is in the germ. 

A SPECIAL USE FOR CORN MEAL. 

Corn meal, because of its lack of gluten, cannot be made into light and porous breads 
except by the addition of eggs or of wheat, rye, Graham, or gluten flour, or in some similar 



CLASS 1 6— VEGETABLES— POTATOES 195 

way. The absence of gluten, which with water forms a sticky, tenacious mass, is responsi- 
ble, however, for the fact that the meal retains much of its granular quality even after it has 
been mixed and heated with water. Dishes made with corn meal are likely to be more 
tender than those made with wheat, and the use of small amounts of corn meal in the mak- 
ing of such foods as waffles and doughnuts is to be recommended. 

COOKING CORN MEAL. 

A study of the modifications in methods of cooking which have been rendered 
necessary by changes in the composition of the meal was made at Teachers College, Co- 
lumbia University, New York City, for the Office of Experiment Stations. The results of 
these investigations, which are still unpublished, may be summarized as follows: In gen- 
eral, 10 per cent more water is needed for the new-process meal than for the old-process, 
and where the large amount of water used renders the meal liable to sink (in breads, for 
example), the mixture of meal and water should be thoroughly heated before being used. 

In experiments made in this office it was found that, when convenience as well as 
the final result is taken into consideration, it is best for almost every purpose to put the 
meal and cold water together and then heat them over boiling water in a double boiler. 
Except when very finely ground meals are used it is unnecessary to stir the mixture at any 
time, not even when the meal and water are put together. The conclusion has been 
reached, in fact, that in all cases — even those in which the liquid used is not water but 
either sweet or sour milk — the best results are obtained by heating the meal and liquid 
together without stirring. This applies to the making of cornmeal mush and also to more 
complicated dishes, such as breads. 



PLENTY OF POTATOES 

(U. S. Food Adminstration Food Leaflet No. 10) 

They Are a Splendid Food. Excellent For Your Body. 

Delicious When Well Cooked. 

WHAT THEY DO FOR YOUR BODY. 

They are good fuel. They furnish starch which burns in your muscles to 

let you work, much as the gasoline burns in an automobile engine to make the 

car go. 

One medium-sized potato gives you as much starch as two slices of bread. 
When you have potatoes for a meal you need less bread. Potatoes can save wheat. 
They give you salts like other vegetables. You need the salts to build and 
renew all the parts of your body and to keep it in order. 

POTATOES AT THEIR BEST. 
One old king is said to have tested each cook before hiring him by asking 
him to boil a potato. Even the best potato can be spoiled by a poor cook. 

TO BOIL THEM so that they will be "fit for a king," drop the unpeeled 
potatoes into boiling salted water and cook 20 to 30 minutes. Drain the water off 
at once. If they are cooked too long or allowed to stand in the water they get 
soggy. 

If you peel the potatoes before cooking them you will waste time and pota- 
toes both. You may throw away a sixth or even a quarter of the good part of the 
potato with the skins. Also, if the potatoes aren't covered up by the skins while 
cooking, some of the valuable material will soak out into the water. Even very 
small potatoes can be economically used, if they are boiled in their skins. 



1 96 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Sec. IV— Pt. 2— COOKING AND RECIPES 

FOR BEST MASHED POTATOES. Peel the boiled potatoes, mash and 
beat until very light, adding salt, butter or oleomargarine and hot milk, a half cup 
of milk to six potatoes. If dinner is not ready to serve, pile lightly in a pan and set 
in the oven to brown. 

POTATOES ARE GOOD IN BREADS. Get Farmers' Bulletin No. 807, 
"Bread and Bread Making in the Home," from the Department of Agriculture, 
Washington, D. C., to learn how to make potato yeast bread. 

POTATOES ARE GOOD IN CAKE. They are often used in this way to 
keep the cake from drying out quickly. Mash the potatoes and beat up with milk 
until very light. You can use your usual cake recipe, substituting one cup of 
mashed potatoes for one-half cup of milk and one-half cup of flour. 

POTATOES FOR YOUR MAIN DISH. Potatoes, left over or fresh, may 
be combined with cheese or nuts or meat or other material, often to make the main 
dish of a meal. 

VEGETABLES FOR WINTER 

(U. S. Food Administration Food Leaflet No. 9) 

Everybody Needs Them — Grown People and Children, Too. 

DON'T STOP USING "them IN WINTER even if they are harder to get 
than in summer. 

Doctors say that the tired-out feeling at the end of the winter — "spring 
fever" — often comes from a lack of fruits and vegetables in the winter diet. Keep 
the family well and make their meals pleasanter by using vegetables. Give them 
to children especially. Young children can digest them better if they are maished 
and put through a sieve. 

The salts or "mineral matter" that vegetables contain is one of your chief 
helps in keeping your body strong and well. 

In every part of your body there are salts somewhat like table talt, but of 
many kinds — iron, lime and others. Your body won't work smoothly unless it 
has plenty of these salts, and the children can't build strong bodies without them. 
You must get them from your food. Vegetables and fruit are rich in them. ELat 
a variety so as to be sure to get all the kinds of salts you need. 

The salts and other substances in vegetables also help prevent constipation. 
Keep yourself and your children well. 

FRESH WINTER VEGETABLES. , 
These include cabbage, turnips, onions, carrots, potatoes, etc., which are 
always good simply cooked, stewed, boiled or baked, and served with a little butter 
or oleomargarine or a simple cream sauce. You waste valuable salts when you 
throw away the water in which you cook vegetables. Sometimes the flavor is 
not desirable, but if it is good, save the water for soup or gravy. Even better — 
cook them in as little water as possible so there is none left to drain off. Or bake 

or steam them. , , , . , . , i i f i 

Cabbage is one of the vegetables that is best simply cooked, it may be poor 

or it may be delicious, depending upon how you cook it. Don't boil it too long — 

20 or 30 minutes in salted water is long enough. 

The winter vegetables are excellent, too, combined with meats to make 

savory stews.

CLASS 1 6— VEGETABLES— DIRECTIONS 197 

CANNED VEGETABLES. 

Often canned vegetables need only skillful seasoning to make them as good 
as fresh. Chopped onions or green peppers may add a good flavor. Of course, 
you will not use any canned vegetables about which there is a suspicion of spoilage. 

Canned corn is very good when turned into a baking dish, milk and season- 
ing added, and the whole heated through in the oven and allowed to brown on top. 
Outside stalks of celery cut up, a green pepper, or both, added before baking, make 
the dish more appetizing. 

DRIED VEGETABLES. 

Do you use them? They are as good as canned or better. Dried beans 
and peas are well known. Besides these, you can dry all kinds yourself, especially 
if you have a garden and get them fresh. The only change that takes place is the 
loss of water. The salts and other valuable parts are the same as in the fresh. 
Farmers' Bulletin 841 tells how to dry vegetables. 

To prepare dried vegetables for cooking first soak them for several hours or 
overnight so that they w^ill take up the water lost in drying. Then cook them exact- 
ly as you would fresh ones — as a vegetable, in soups, or with meat. They make 
a good, economical addition to your winter meals. 

VEGETABLES SAVE MEAT AND WHEAT. 

Beans and peas have long been used in place of some meat. Like meat, 
they furnish protein w^hich the body needs. 

Potatoes and other starchy vegetables can save wheat. Use them in bread 
making or use less bread at the meals where such vegetables are served. Bread 
and starchy vegetables are both good sources of body fuel. 

VARIETY AND FLAVOR IN YOUR MEALS. 



VEGETABLES— GENERAL DIRECTIONS 

Select fresh, crisp vegetables and prepare for cooking as soon as possible. 
They should be kept in a cool place. Turnips, carrots, parsnips and similiar roots 
may be kept plump and fresh by being put into boxes filled with earth or sand and 
kept in a cool place. 

Wash vegetables in cold, cook in boiling water. Cook green or top-ground 
vegetables uncovered. Put in I teaspoon salt to each quart of water. White or 
underground vegetables are better when salt is added after cooking. 

Soak dried peas, beans, lentils and dried fruits over night. Soak old pota- 
toes in cold water 1 hour before cooking. Freshen wilted vegetables by putting on 
ice or in cold water to w^hich a little borax is added. 

Open canned goods 1 hour before using. Empty from can at once, drain 
in colander, pour cold water over and put in cool place. 

To prevent odors from arising from cabbage, cauliflower, onions, turnips, 
cook rapidly uncovered or add a piece of charcoal. 

The water in which cabbage or turnips have been boiled will be found ex- 
cellent for cooking dried vegetables such as beans or lentils, macaroni or spaghetti. 

Sprinkle a little salt on parsley when chopping; it will chop much finer and 
easier.

RECIPES 



Asparagus — This may be served as a vegetable 
hot, or as a salad cold with French dressing. 

On Toast — Wash green asparagus, cut off the 
toughest part of the thick ends, tie in a bunch 
and boil gently 20 or 30 minutes in enough salted 
water to cover. If canned asparagus is used, drain 
off the water in the can, remove the stalks without 
breaking to a saucepan, cover with boiling salted 
water until heated through. Serve on buttered 
toast with melted butter or Hollandaise sauce. 

Creamed — Cut up all the tender parts of a bunch 
of boiled asparagus. Boil down the water in which 
it has been cooked to 2/3 cupful, add 3 tbsp. 
cream, cook to a thick sauce, add Y4 teasp. salt, 
few grains paprika and pour over asparagus. 
Serve on squares of toast or in sauce dishes. This 
n>ay be varied by adding a minced hard boiled egg 
to the sauce, or by laying a slice of tomato on 
the toast before pouring the creamed asparagus 
over. 

Baked — Lay the tender parts of two bunches 
of cooked asparagus in a shallow casserole or 
baking pan. Put around and over them minced 
cooked ham. Pour over all 4 eggs, !4 teasp. 
salt, Yi teasp. pepper, 4 tbsp. minced ham beaten 
together as for omelets. Bake until the eggs are 
lightly set, about 5 minutes. Serve at luncheon 
with mashed or stuffed potatoes, or watercress and 
fresh tomatoes. 



Luncheon Aspareigus with Vegetable Mayon- 
naise — ^Arrange 4 individual portions of buttered 
toast or fried bread on a long dish. Place on these 
cold cooked asparagus and pour over them a cold 
vegetable mayonnaise sauce made of Yz cupful 
shredded cooked vegetables, as carrots, turnips, 
green beans, mixed with I cup thick mayonnaise. 
Chill on ice until time to serve. 

Artichokes — Cut the stalks close of 1 2 arti- 
chokes, clip sharp points from leaves, wash and 
lay in cold salted water for 20 minutes. Cook in 
boiling salted water about 45 minutes. They 
should be tender enough to draw out the leaves. 
Drain, serve hot with Hollandaise sauce or serve 
cold on lettuce leaves with a vinaegrette sauce of 
6 tbsp. olive oil beaten with I tbsp. vinegar, salt, 
and red pepper, chopped parsley and chopped 
capers, or small pickles. 

Beets — Select young fresh beets, old ones will 
never cook tender; wash, cut off leaves one inch 
from beets, cook in boiling water about 20 minutes. 
When done, skin, slice into a hot dish and pour 
over butter to which a little sugar has been added. 
Cover to keep hot till served. 

Brussel Sprouts — Pick off all dark leaves, lay in 
salted water 1 3 minutes. Drain, cook in boiling 
water uncovered till tender. Drain, serve at once 
with a good cream sauce. 



CLASS 1 6— VEGETABLES— RECIPES

String Beans — I. Select them young and crisp, 
string, break in halves, boil about I hour in just 
enough water to cover. When tender and water 
nearly gone add pepper and salt, butter, and Yi 
cup cream. Simmer 3 minutes, serve on a hot 
dish. One or two slices of salt pork boiled with 
the beans add to the richness of their flavor, then 
omit the cream in the sauce. 

2. Parboil I qt. green string beans 30 minutes; 
drain, add 2 tbsp. butter, I teasp. sugar, J/^ teasp. 
salt, dash of pepper. Cook slowly 5 minutes, then 
add Y^ <^"P meat stock, Y^ cup water the beans 
were boiled in, Yl teasp. lemon juice. Simmer 
till tender. 

Lima Beans — Soak all dried beans overnight and 
cook next day in boiling water for 40 minutes, or 
until tender. Add salt 1 minutes before done, 
drain, season with butter, salt, or a cream sauce, or 
cook a piece of salt pork with them. 

Boston Baked Beans — Soak I lb. California pea 
beans overnight. Next morning simmer slowly in 
water to cover, add ^ teasp. soda. When beans 
are swelled but not bursted lift out into clear hot 
water for a few minutes. Wash and score Yl ^• 
salt pork. Put into a hot earthen bean pot a layer 
of beans, the pork in the center, then fill up with 
beans. Dissolve in boiling water 1 tbsp. molasses, 
Ya teasp. mustard, I teasp. salt. Pour over the 
beans and fill pot with boiling water. Bake slowly 
5 or 6 hours. Keep beans almost covered with 
water until the last hour, then let water cook two- 
thirds away. 

Frijoles con Queso — Boil I pt. red beans till 
soft and water boiled down; drain, turn into fry- 
ing pan with 2 tbsp. butter, salt,- cayenne, and 
14 lb. grated cheese. Stir until cheese thoroughly 
blends. Serve hot. 

Kidney Bean Stew — Put on to stew I cup soaked 
red kidney beans with I pt. canned tomatoes, Yi 
teasp. pepper, I teasp. salt. Clean, cut up I small 
oxtail; add to the beans with water to cover. Sim- 
mer 3 hours, add a sprig of parsley the last half 
hour.

I Yz cups bread crumbs, Y^ green pepper, minced, 

1 cup cream or rich milk, I cup cooked tomatoes, 
few grains paprika, Ya teasp. salt. Mix all together. 
Bake in buttered dish in moderate oven I hour. 
Serve hot or cold, sliced. If the green pepper is 
omitted, garnish with thin slices of pimiento. 

Kidney Beans and Rice (with Brown Sauce) — 
Cook I pt. shelled beans in salted water until ten- 
der. Make a brown sauce of 2 tbsp. butter or beef 
suet browned, I tbsp. flour stirred in and browned, 

2 cups beef stock added. Season with salt and 
pepper. When beans are done, add brown sauce 
and 1 cup cooked rice. Cook 1 minute. If gravy 



is used in place of stock, omit the butter. In food 
value this dish takes the place of both meat and 
potatoes. 

The Soy Bean or "Togo Bean" — Soy beans are 
rich in protein and fat and lacking in starch, so 
should be cooked without fat pork and served at 
the same meal with a starchy vegetable, as rice, 
to make a balanced ration. Any recipe for dried 
beans may be used for Soy beans by omitting the 
fat pork. 

Soy Bean Loaf — Pick over and mash 2 cupfuls 
Soy beans. Cover with water and let stand at 
least 12 hours. Drain. Cook in fresh water with 
Yl level teasp. salt until tender, longer than the I 
hour for navy beans. When done, drain, put aside 
the water for soup. Serve the beans plain with 
rice and spinach, or mash beans and cool for a 
loaf. Add 1 minced onion, a pinch of cayenne 
and black pepper, 2 cups toasted bread crumbs. 
\Yl cups milk. Mix well, fold in 2 well-beaten 
eggs. Bake in a flat buttered pan for 40 minutes, 
basting with !4 cup milk. Brown, slice and serve 
hot with tomato sauce and boiled rice. 

Lentil Croquettes — Soak and cook lentils as 
dried beans. Rub I cup soft cooked lentils through 
strainer to remove skins. Mix with I cup cooked 
rice, Yl cup milk, I beaten egg, a bit of sage and 
salt to taste. Form into croquettes, roll in beaten 
egg, then in bread crumbs. Moisten the tops with 
a little milk and bake in oven until brown. 

Succotash — Put soaked lima beans on to boil. 
When almost done, add corn cut from the cobs. 
Have twice as much corn as beans. Boil together 
20 minutes, until nearly dry, adding butter if the 
beans have not been boiled with salt pork. Season 
with pepper and salt, Yl cup rich milk. Simmer 
and stir 3 minutes. Serve. 

Green Com — Select fresh tender corn. Boil 15 
minutes. Send to the table at once in a napkin 
or covered dish. Tender corn is often toughened 
by cooking too long. 

Green Com Pudding — Remove husks and silk 
from 1 dozen small ears of corn. Cut the kernels 
down fine and scrape cob. Turn the corn into Yl 
pt. hot milk, thickened with 1 tbsp. butter, I tbsp. 
flour, Yl teasp. sugar, Ya, teasp. salt. Add I or 2 
beaten eggs. Stir well together. Pour into but- 
tered baking dish. Bake in moderate oven 30 
minutes. Sprinkle buttered crumbs over top and 
brown. Serve in baking dish. 

Com Oysters — To I pt. grated corn or canned 

corn mashed, add I or 2 eggs, 2 large grated 

crackers or Yl teacup flour. Beat well, season 

with salt and pepper. Drop by spoonfuls in hot 

fat. When brown, drain as fried oysters. Serve 
hot with jelly or maple syrup for breakfast, or for 
lunch with cold boiled ham.

POTATOES 

Potatoes — Potatoes are composed principally of 
starch and water. As they are lacking in protein 
they should be served with meat, fish or eggs. 
They give the necessary bulk to food. 

New Potatoes — Scrape until white, wash in cold 
and cook in boiling salted water about 30 min- 
utes; drain, shake dry over fire. Serve plain 
with butter, or pour over them a white sauce. 
This may be seasoned with chopped meat or pars- 
ley or grated cheese.

thin or scrape, soak in cold 'water, boil in salted 
water 45 minutes, or until they can be pierced with 
a fork; drain; or: Wash and boil with skins on; 
when done, drain, set back uncovered to steam 
dry, skin while hot. Serve plain with salt and 
butter or brush over with butter and brown quickly 
under oven flame. 

Mashed — Boil 6 potatoes, drain, mash while hot 
and beat to a snow white stiffness with 2 tbsp. 
butter, I teasp. salt, rich milk enough to moisten. 
Serve at once on hot dish. Stiff whites of eggs 
or grated cheese beaten in last add to the lightness 
and richness of the potatoes. 

Baked Mashed — Spread hot mashed potatoes in 
a mound or drop from a large spoon on a but- 
tered fireproof dish. Lay on top a heavy layer 
of thin sliced or grated cheese. Heat in oven

milk over the whole, about Yl '^^'? to every 3 pota- 
toes. Skim milk is good. Bake in a moderate oven 
until done. The length of time required depends 
upon whether the potatoes are raw or boiled and 
whether the baking dish used is deep or shallow. 
Boiled potatoes baked in a shallow dish will take 
only 20 minutes. Raw potatoes in a deep dish 
may take as much as I Yl hours. 

Baked Stu£fed — Take 6 baked potatoes from oven 
when about done. Cut in two lengthwise or slice 
end off each without breaking skin and scoop out 
inside. Prepare as for mashed potatoes with 3

BAKED POTATO DONTS 

The Irishman claims that the only thing better 
than a good baked potato is two baked potatoes. 
Here are some baked potato don'ts: 

Don't have your oven too hot. 

Don't have different-sized potatoes. 

Don't delay in getting them into the oven — they 
will not hurry when the time is short. 

Don't fail to allow them from 45 minutes to an 
hour for a medium-sized (6 ounce) potato. 

Don't select potatoes that are too big. 

Don't put them into your oven dripping with 
cold water. 

Don't plan to serve them as a second course in 

a dinner; it is difficult to get them just right use 

them with the first course in a lunch or supper.

Care of Bread — Bread boxes should be thoroughly washed and scalded and 
dried over the fire before each new baking. When dry do not leave box open. 
Keep dry old rolls or bread in an earthen crock; they should be ground and used 
for crumbing, etc. 

To Keep Bread Fresh — After baking bread let it cool, then put in paper bags 
and into bread jars. 

To keep bread and butter fresh when cut, place in a cool place and cover 
closely with a clean cloth that has been wrung out of cold water. 

To make old bread new, dampen it all over with milk, put in a hot oven about 
20 minutes. It is better to do this the day before it is used. 

When making bread boil I large potato until done, mash thoroughly and 
use along with the water it was boiled in. It makes lighter, finer bread, remains 
moist longer and makes one more loaf to each 3 qts. of flour. 

The Importance of Good Bread — (Farmers' Bulletin 81 7, on "How to Select 
Foods") — Because bread is often really "the staff of life" it is very important to 
have it good. People's ideas may differ as to exactly how bread should taste or how 
it should be made, but in this country, all are agreed that yeast-raised bread should 
be light and spongy, with a crisp, tender, golden brown crust, and that it should be 
nutty and sweet in flavor. Heavy, soggy bread, when it is swallowed, forms 
tough lumps which the digestive organs cannot work upon properly, and, if eaten 
day after day, may do serious harm. Every housekeeper should try, therefore, to 
provide light, well-baked bread for her family. 

Flour should be kept in a cool, dry place away from dust and also away from foods 
which have strong odors as flour absorbs flavors easily. 

Yeast — (Farmers' Bulletin 807, on "Bread") — If yeast plants are well distributed 
throughout a mass of dough many bubbles with thin walls will be formed. If they are not 
well distributed there are likely to be no bubbles in some places and large bubbles with thick 
walls in others. 

The kinds of yeast most commonly used are compressed, dry, and liquid yeast. 

Compressed yeast is very convenient, for in this form the yeast plants are active 
and ready to begin their work. However, it is not easy to keep it long in good condition 
and so is commonly purchased fresh each time it is needed. When in good condition it is 
soft and yet brittle and is the same color throughout, a creamy white. 

Dry yeast can be kept for a long time. It is, however, less active than compressed 
yeast, and for this reason is not convenient when the bread making must be hastened, but 
only in the long process or "sponge" method. 

Liquid yeast, like compressed yeast, is in active condition. It is easily made at home, 
and in a cool place can be kept for about two weeks.

208 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Sec. IV— Pt. 2— COOKING AND RECIPES 

Milk — (Farmers' Bulletin 807, on "Bread") — Whole or skim milk may be substi- 
tuted for part or all of the water used in making bread. It should be scalded thoroughly 
before use. When the long or overnight process is followed, it is well not to use milk in the 
sponge, for it is likely to turn sour. 

Fat — (Farmers' Bulletin 807, on "Bread") — Fat, if used, may be butter, lard, beef 
fat, cottonseed oil, or any other of the ordinary fats used in cooking. It should, however, 
be wholesome, of good quality, and in good condition. Bread is so little improved by the 
addition of fat that it is a mistake to run the slightest risk of injuring its flavor by using fat 
of questionable quality. 

Utensils — (Farmers' Bulletin 807, on "Bread") — The necessary utensils are mixing 
bowl, measuring spoons, measuring cup (of standard size, holding about half a pint), mix- 
ing spoon or knife, and baking pans. Utensils desirable under some circumstances, particu- 
larly when several loaves are to be made, are bread mixer for kneading, molding board, 
bread raiser, and bread rack. 

Shaping the Loaves — When the dough has risen sufficiently, cut or tear it into the 
required number of loaves. Take each piece of dough in the hands and work it lightly in 
such a way as to stretch the underside, w^hich is to become the top of the loaf. In forming 
the loaf, make no effort to fit it to the shape of the pan, for in rising it will fill out the cor- 
ners. Strive merely to form it into an oblong piece with a smooth surface. (Same Bulletin.) 

Baking — (Farmers' Bulletin 807, on "Bread") — Loaves made with I cupful of 
liquid each should be baked 50 minutes. They should begin to brown in about 15 minutes. 
After that time the temperature of the oven should be lowered so that the loaves will bake 
slowly. The temperature should be 400 or 425 F. to begin with, should be increased to 
425 F., and then dropped gradually to about 380 F. The surest way to get these tem- 
peratures is by means of an oven thermometer or an oven gauge. In the absence of these 
the following test may be made: Put into the oven a small piece of white paper, a white 
cracker, or half a level teaspoon of flour spread in a layer J/4 or J/g inch thick on a tin plate. 
If it becomes a light golden brown in 5 minutes, the oven is about right in temperature to 
begin the baking. 

If possible, pans should be so placed in the oven that the air w^ill circulate around 
them. If they touch each other or the sides of the oven, the loaves will rise unevenly and be 
of unsightly shape. If the oven is crowded, it may be necessary to change the position of 
the pans occasionally to insure well-shaped loaves. 



BREAD RECIPES 



Proportions Used for Almost Every Kind of 
Simple Yeast-Raised Bread — (Farmers' Bulletin, 
817, on "How to Select Foods") — 1 cup liquid 
(water, milk, skim or whole, whey, or a mixture 
of two or more of them), I level teasp. salt, 1 
level tbsp. sugar, 3 cups sifted flour (or a very 
little more or less), yeast ('/g to Yl cake com- 
pressed yeast, depending on the length of time 
the dough is to stand. Liquid and dry yeast may 
be used, but the exact amount cannot be so easily 
stated) ; if more loaves are to be baked at one 
time, multiply the quantities given above by the 
number of loaves desired. (The above proportions 
are used for one loaf.) 

Yeast-raised bread can be made using Graham, 
or the so-called whole wheat flour instead of the 
usual bread flour. 



Short or Straight-Dough Process — (Farmers' 
Bulletin, 817, on "How to Select Food&") — Boil the 
water or scald the milk. Put the sugar and salt 
(and fat, if used) into a mixing bovirl. Pour the 
hot liquid over it and allow it to become lukewarm. 
Mix the yeast with a little of the lukewarm liquid 
and add it to the rest of the liquid. If convenient, 
set this aside in a warm place, not over 86 P., for 
one hour; if not convenient to set aside, add the 
flour at once, putting in a little at a time and 
kneading until the dough is of such consistency 
that it sticks neither to the bowl nor to the hands. 
This requires about 1 minutes. Cover and allow 
to rise 1% hours at a temperature of 86 P.; it 
may be better to set it at a lower temperature, 
but the lower the temperature the longer the time 
required for the rising. Cut down the dough from 



CLASS 1 7— BREAD— RECIPES

the sides of the bowl; grease the hands slightly. 
Knead a little and set aside to rise again for one 
hour. With a good bread flour, the dough would 
treble its bulk in each rising. With a soft wheat 
flour, it should not rise much beyond twice its 
volume. Divide into portions, mold, and place in 
greased pans. Allow to rise until a light touch 
will make a slight dent. Bake 50 minutes. 

Short-Sponge Method (Same Bulletin) — Bread 
can be made during the day by what is known as 
the "short-sponge" method. All the ingredients 
are the same as for the "short or straight-dough" 
process, but only half of the flour is added at first. 
When this mixture, which is called a "sponge," is 
so light that it will fall at the slightest touch, it 
is ready for the addition of the rest of the flour. 

Overnight Sponge Method — Use the same pro- 
portions as for the short process, except in the 
case of the yeast, which should be '/g cake of 
compressed yeast or 2 tbsp. of liquid yeast for 
each loaf. Use water rather than milk. In the 
evening mix the yeast with water, salt, and half 
of the flour, and beat thoroughly. Cover and place 
at a temperature of 63 to 70 F., or that of an 
ordinary room. In the morning add the sugar 
and the rest of the flour and proceed as in the 
case of the short process. (Same Bulletin.) 

Overnight Straight-Dough Method (Same Bul- 
letin) — Use the same ingredients as for the over- 
night sponge method, but put in all ingredients 
at night. If the following rules are observed, the 
bread is almost sure to be of good quality and to 
keep well: 

( I ) Keep everything clean, protect the flour 
from dust, and scald all liquid ingredients thor- 
oughly. 

(2) Keep the dough between 65 and 86 F., and 
do not allow it to stand longer than necessary. 

(3) See that the dough, when placed in the 
oven, has three times the bulk of the dough when 
first made. Dough made with I cupful of liquid 
will reach the top of a 1 !/2 qt. baking pan when 
it has tripled its bulk. 

(4) Bake 45 to 60 minutes at about 400 F. 

(5) Keep closely covered in a clean receptacle 
that is frequently scalded. 

Ash Cake (Corn Bread) — (Farmers' Bulletin, 

565, on "Corn-Meal") 1 qt. corn-meal, 2 teasp. 

salt, I tbsp. lard or other shortening, boiling water. 

Scald the meal; add the salt and shortening, 
and when the mixture is cool form into oblong 
cakes, adding more water if necessary. Wrap the 
cakes in cabbage leaves or place one cabbage leaf 
under the cakes and one over them, and cover 
them with hot ashes. 

South Carolina Yeast Corn Bread — (Farmers' 
Bulletin, 565, on "Corn-Meal" — I J/2 qts. fine 



corn-meal, V/i qts. wheat flour, 2 teasp. salt, I 
pint mashed sweet potatoes, I cake yeast. Or: 
2/4 q's. fine corn-meal, I J/2 qts. wheat flour, 2 
teasp. salt, I pint mashed sweet potatoes, I cake 
yeast. 

Mix I pint each of the corn-meal and the flour 
and add warm water enough to form a stiff batter. 
Add the yeast cake, mixed with a small amount of 
water. Keep this sponge in a warm place until 
it becomes light. Scald the meal with boiling water 
and as soon as it is cool enough add it to the 
sponge with the flour, potatoes, and salt. The 
dough should be just thick enough to knead with- 
out danger of its sticking to the board. Elxperi- 
ence will teach how much water to use to secure 
this end. Knead well and put in a warm place to 
rise. When it is light form into loaves, put into 
bread pans, and let it rise until its volume is 
doubled. Bake in a moderate oven. 

Apple Com Bread (Same Bulletin) — 2 cups 
white corn-meal, 2 tbsp. sugar, Ya teasp. salt, I 
teasp. soda, 1 teasp. cream of tartar, I 2/3 cups 
milk, 3 tart apples, pared and sliced. 

Mix the dry ingredients, add the milk, and heat 
thoroughly. Add the apples. Pour into a well- 
buttered shallow pan and bake 30 minutes or 
longer in hot oven to soften the apples. 

This could be made with dried apricots cooked 
in the usual manner by soaking and cooking 
slowly and adding a little sugar. The juice may 
be used as sauce. 

This serves 6 or 8 people. 

Sour Milk Corn Bread (Without Wheat) — 
(Same Bulletin) — 2 cups corn-meal, 2 cups sour 
milk, 2 tbsp, butter, 2 tbsp. white or brown sugar, 
I J/2 teasp. salt, 2 eggs, 1 teasp. soda, 1 tbsp. cold 
water. 

There are two ways of mixing this bread. By 
the first the meal, milk, salt, butter, and sugar are 
cooked in a double boiler for about 1 minutes. 
When the mixture is cool, the eggs are added, 
well beaten, and the soda dissolved in the water. 
By the other niethod all the dry ingredients, in- 
cluding the soda, are mixed together, and then the 
sour milk and eggs, well beaten, and the butter 
are added. If the second method is followed, the 
cold water is not needed. The bread should be 
baked in a shallow iron or granite pan for about 
30 minutes. 

Since the bread made by the first method is of 
much better texture, that method is to be pre- 
ferred, except in cases where there is not time for 
the necessary heating and cooling of the meal. 

Buttermilk may be substituted for the sour milk, 
in which case the butter should be increased 
slightly; or sour cream may be used and the butter 
omitted. 

This serves 6 people.

STALE BREAD 



(Farmer*' Bulletin, 817, on "How to Select Foods") 
DISCUSSION 



It is generally admitted that more bread goes 
to waste in the average American home than al- 
most any other kind of food. This happens mainly 
because many housekeepers do not know what to 
do with stale bread. Good fresh bread has a 
springy quality which disappears as it ages, prob- 
ably because the water in it gradually passes from 
the center of the loaf out through the crust, leav- 
ing the bread drier and more crumbly. Many per- 
sons think bread is better when it has dried out 
a little, say for 24 hours, but almost everyone 
agrees that really stale bread is too dry to eat with 
enjoyment. Bread that has been cut grows stale 
more quickly than the uncut loaf, and unless the 
housekeeper plans very carefully, she is likely to 
find her bread box full of hard, dry slices and ends 
of loaves which are of no use on the table. To 
avoid this waste she may do two things: (I) Treat 
the bread so it shall not be unappetizing and (2) 
use the stale bread in cooking. 

Toasting is the most common method for mak- 
ing stale or partly stale bread attractive, but it is 
by no means the only one. If partly stale bread 
is put into a very hot oven for a few minutes it 
grows softer, probably because the heat tends to 
drive the water from the crust back into the 
crumb. Such warmed-over bread is not as soft 
and springy as fresh, but some persons find it 
very appetizing. A good plan, therefore, when 
bread has lost its freshness, is to cut off what will 
be needed at a meal and place the slices in a hot 
oven for a few minutes just before serving. In 
this way bread can be used on the table which 
would ordinarily be considered too stale. 

"Twice-baked Bread," which is cut bread placed 
in the warming oven, or in a pan on the back of the 
stove, and allowed to dry out very slowly until it 
is slightly brown and very crisp throughout, offers 



still another way of making stale bread attractive. 
If desired, this twice-baked bread may be crushed 
with a rolling pin and used like the ready-to-eat 
breakfast cereals; in some localities this dish has 
long been known under the name of rusks. The 
little fried cubes of bread called "croutons," which 
are served with soup, may be made with odds and 
ends of bread. To save time, bread simply broken 
into small pieces may be fried either in deep fat 
or in a pan (sauteed) and used for the same pur- 
pose. Sometimes bread crumbs are fried in a pan 
for use in a similar way as a seasoning or sauce 
for meat. French cooks frequently put pieces of 
stale bread in soups just long enough before serv- 
ing for them to soften; the well-known one called 
"crust in the pot" (croute au pot) is simply a thin 
soup with bread in it. 

There are many ways of using stale bread in 
cooking. Almost every good cook-book gives 
directions for preparing soft and dry crumbs for 
use in scalloped dishes, bread puddings, etc. The 
soft parts of the bread may be used in the place 
of flour or cornstarch for thickening soups, sauces, 
gravies, stewed tomatoes (either fresh or canned), 
etc. Bakers often use stale bread and dried, finely 
ground cake in place of part of the flour in making 
fancy breads, cakes, and cookies, and the house- 
keeper can often avoid waste by using them in 
this way in griddle-cakes, cakes, cookies, etc. 

Stale crackers serve many of the same uses as 
stale bread. If they have lost their crispness, they, 
too, can usually be freshened by warn>ing in the 
oven, and the fine crumbs may be used in the 
same way as dried bread crumbs. 

The texture of stale cake and cookies is not so 
easily improved by heating, but they may be dried, 
crushed, and used like bread crumbs wherever 
their flavor and texture allow. 



STALE BREAD RECIPES 
Showing How Bread Crumbs May Be Used Instead of Flour in Various Dishes 

Vegetable Skim Milk Soup — (Nearly all the materials used in this soup are those 
that are often thrown away — skim milk, the outside leaves of lettuce, and stale bread.) 

One quart skim milk, I slice stale bread, 2 ozs. of the outer leaves of lettuce (6 
large leaves), a few celery tips, or a thin slice onion, salt and pepper. 

Chop the vegetables finely. A convenient way, particularly if the soup is being 
made in large quantities, is to use a food grinder and to put the bread through it with the 
vegetables to catch the juice. Cook the finely chopped vegetables and the bread in the 
milk in the double boiler for about 20 minutes. Season.

U. S. FOOD ADMINISTRATION BREAD RECIPES 

Using Barley, Rye, Rice and Potatoes 



Barley Yeast Bread — Introductory statement: 
Bread may be made using wheat flour and barley 
flour in mixtures containing from 33 1-3 to 50 per 
cent, barley flour. The bread containing one- 
third barley flour is light, palatable, and of espe- 
cially pleasant flavor. A larger percentage pro- 
duces a heavier, darker bread of pronounced barley 
flavor. The manipulation for this bread is the 
same as for wheat bread. The conditions and 
time for baking are also the same. The loaf is 
smaller. 

I cup milk and water, or water (8 oz. ), I tbsp. 
sugar {I/2 oz.), 1 tbsp. fat (J/2 oz.), I teasp. salt 
(14 oz-)> 1 1/6 cups barley flour (4 oz.), 2 1/3 
cups wheat flour (9 1/3 oz.), ]/2 cake compressed 
yeast (J/^ oz. ). 

Soften the yeast in part of the liquid. Com- 
bine ingredients. Mix into a dough. Knead and 
let rise to double original bulk. Knead again. Put 
in the pan, and when again double in bulk bake 
about 45 minutes. 

Rye Yeast Bread — Introductory statements : Com- 
mercial rye breads are made of a mixture of wheat 
and rye flours, known in the trade as 50-50. Rye 
flour has much less expansion than wheat flour; 
hence the loaves are smaller. The manipulation 
is the same throughout as for wheat bread. 

I cup milk and water, or water (8 oz.), 1 tbsp. 
fat ('/2 oz.), 2 tbsp. sugar (1 oz.), 1 teasp. salt 
(!4 oz.), 2 14 cups rye flour (7 oz.), 2J/^ cups 
wheat flour (9 oz. ), J/2 cake compressed yeast 
(54 oz. ), 2 tbsp. water (I oz.). 

Combine the ingredients. Mix into dough and 
knead. Let rise until double original bulk. Knead 
again. When again double bulk, bake about 45 
minutes. 

Rice Yeast Bread — Rice has many other uses, as 
in puddings, etc., and is much in demand among 
the allies. Therefore its use should not be stressed 
in connection with emergency breads. 

Cooked rice, combined with wheat flour, makes 
delicious muffins and yeast bread. There are 
many ways of cooking the rice. The basic prin- 
ciples may be stated as follows: First, cook the 
rice so as to conserve all mineral matter and other 
soluble products. 

Method: After the rice is thoroughly washed 
it should be put in a thick iron kettle or stoneware 
baking dish, cold water added so that the water 
stands % of an inch to an inch clear above the rice. 
A heavy or weighted cover should be used to seal 
the dish. Cook slowly over direct heat or in the oven 
until all the water has been absorbed and the grains 
are soft and steam escapes from the vessel. This 



is the Japanese method. The second method, more 
frequently used in the United States, is to use a 
very large amount of boiling water to a small 
amount of rice, the rice being added slowly 
enough not to stop the boiling. The water is 
boiled briskly 20 minutes, or until the kernels are 
tender. Then it is drained in a colander or 
strainer, set on the back of the stove, or put in a 
slightly warm oven or in a pan over hot water, to 
dry off a bit. There results a fluffy mass of large, 
plump grains, each perfectly distinct in itself, in- 
stead of the gummy mush so often served as 
boiled rice. 

The rice yeast bread is very white in color, is 
moister that wheat bread, and keeps moist longer. 
It is handled in much the same manner as wheat 
bread. The first dough, however, is much stiffer, 
and after once rising the light dough is so soft that 
it cannot be kneaded with the hands. It should be 
well stirred with a strong spoon and placed in the 
pans, looking much like a stiff drop batter. After 
baking, the upper crust is less smooth than that of 
our familiar wheat flour loaf. 

Proportions and directions: These amounts make 
two or three small loaves of bread. 

Rice Yeast Bread — J/2 cup milk and water, or 
water (4 oz.), 4 tbsp. sugar (2 oz.), 4 tbsp. fat 
(2 oz. ), I J/2 teasp. salt (% oz.), 7 cups boiled 
rice, 8 cups flour (32 oz. ), J/2 cake compressed 
yeast (J4 oz. ), J/^ cup warm water (2 oz.). 

Scald liquid if milk is used. Pour over fat, sugar, 
and salt. Cool and add yeast, moistened in J4 cup 
warm water. Add rice and flour and knead. After 
second rising, bake 45 minutes. 

Potato Yeast Bread — Introductory statements: 
Boiled potatoes, mashed and combined with wheat 
flour, may be used in making a bread of good 
flavor and texture. The potato bread is slightly 
darker in color than patent flour bread and is also 
somewhat more moist. It is relished by persons 
who do not care for any but so-called "white 
bread." Two manipulations are satisfactory. 
Either all the flour may be added in the first mix- 
ture, making a dough which is very stiff and diffi- 
cult to knead, or a part of the flour may be reserved 
and added with the second kneading. In either 
case, the dough is soft at the second handling, but 
after baking it produces a satisfactory loaf. 

The following amounts make 3 loaves of bread: 

Potato Yeast Bread — J/2 cup milk and water, 
or water (4 oz.), 4 tbsp. sugar (2 oz.), 4 tbsp. 
fat (2 oz.), 1 J/2 teasp. salt (% oz.), 4 cups boiled 
potatoes, 8 cups flour (32 oz.), J/2 cake com- 
pressed yeast (J4 oz.), J4 cup warm water (2 
oz.). , I

CEREAL FOODS 

(From "How to Select Foods," U. S. Department of Agriculture) 

Where economy is especially needed cereals (the lower-priced ones, of course) 
should be used as freely as they can be without making the diet one-sided. In this they 
differ from such higher-priced foods as milk, meat, fruits, and vegetables, which, in case 
of need, must be cut down so far as they safely can be. To encourage the use of cereals 
housekeepers should — 

(a) Provide the very best of bread; that is, bread that is well flavored, 
light, of good texture, and well baked. 

(b) Take particular pains in cooking and salting the lower-priced break- 
fast cereals. The same rule applies to such food." as hominy, boiled rice, or macar- 
oni, commonly served with meat or other protein-rich food at luncheon, dinner, or 
supper. 

(c) Remember that, though large quantities of cereal foods may not seem 
attractive if served alone, they may be very appetizing if combined with small 
amounts of more highly flavored or seasoned foods. A well-seasoned soup may 
lead to the eating of a large quantity of bread. A little savory meat or fish (salted 
or smoked), or a small quantity of cheese, may be used to flavor a fairly large dish 
of rice or macaroni. 

This bulletin discusses the way in which cereal foods may be wisely used in the diet. 

The term "cereal foods" may mean: (I) The kernels of corn, oats, rice, rye, 
wheat, etc.; (2) the flours, meals, breakfast foods, starches, etc., manufactured from them; 
or (3) bread, crackers, cakes, pastry, etc., in which they form an important part. It will 
be easier to understand their use in the diet if these three general forms are borne in mind. 

Kind of Cereals — The most common cereals are wheat, rye, corn, oats, and rice. 
They differ somewhat in appearance, taste, and food value, but all have many features in 
common. 

TTie most abundant food material in cereals is starch, which serves the body as fuel. 
This makes up nearly three-quarters of most grains. The next most abundant material is 
protein, which supplies nitrogen for tissue building. This makes up about one-eighth of 
the grain. There is also a little fat, particularly in corn and oats; it is found chiefly in the 
germ. Another important material is the "roughage" or cellulose, which is most abundant 
in the skin of the grain and which gives bulk to the diet. The kernels also contain actually 
small, but relatively high, proportions of mineral matters needed for body building and 
other purposes and other substances very important for regulating body processes. 

The protein is not alike in all kinds of cereals. Part of that in wheat is a tough, 
elastic sort, called gluten. It is because of this gluten, which can be expanded into air bub- 
bles, that light, porous bread can be made from wheat. Rye is most like wheat in the 
character of its gluten, though light, porous bread can not be made from it alone. Barley, 
buckwheat, corn, oats, and rice are so lacking in gluten that they cannot be raised by yeast. 

Prepared Cereals — By prepared cereals are meant such manufactured goods as flours 
and meals, cracked wheat, steamed and rolled oats, puffed or flaked grains of all kinds, 
macaroni and other pastes, cornstarch, etc. They may or may not contain all of the orig- 
inal grain, and for this reason they differ more widely than the grains themselves in appear- 
ance, composition and flavor. The cooking which some of them undergo during manufac- 
ture also causes changes. Of course, unless something is added to them, they contain no 
food material not present in the grains from which they are made.

2 1 8 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Sec. IV— Pt. 2— COOKING AND RECIPES 

Prepared cereals differ so much in form that their appearance gives little idea of 
the amount of nourishment they yield. For instance, the amount of flour which will fill 
a cup weighs 4 ounces; that of rice 8 or 9ounces; and that of flaked breakfast cereal, 
hardly half an ounce; and it is this weight rather than bulk or volume which indicates food 
value. Such differences in weight and volume must be remembered by those who wish to 
buy their food as cheaply as possible. Some breakfast foods retail at 48 cents a pound ( I 5 
cents for a 5 -ounce package) ; others cost 5 or 6 cents a pound. The cheapest ones are 
usually those sold in bulk. The housekeeper, by grinding her own wheat, can get a cereal 
breakfast food for a still smaller sum. When wheat sells for $2 a bushel the cost per 
pound is between 3 and 4 cents. This wheat can be prepared by washing, drying, and then 
grinding in an ordinary coffee mill. 

One of the important differences between these preparations depends on whether 
or not any of the outer coating of the kernel has been left in. This coating consists mainly 
of bulky cellulose, but it also contains a large part of the important tissue-forming mineral 
compounds and body-regulating substances found in the grain. When the bran is left in, 
the preparation is more bulky and contains more of some food elements. On the other 
hand, it does not always keep as well and (in the case of flour) does not make as light 
bread, and is not so thoroughly digested. Evidently, then, the choice of cereal foods should 
depend on the purpose they are to serve. If bread or breakfast cereals are used as the chief 
part of a meal or of a diet which does not include much of vegetables, fruits, milk and eggs, 
and which, therefore, may be lacking in bulk and mineral salts, it is well to choose the 
bran-containing preparations. This should be especially remembered in considering the diet 
of children, for they need more body-building mineral compounds and body-regulating 
substances than adults. If, on the other hand, the diet in general is varied and if flour is 
to be used for cakes, pastry, and general cooking, white flour is more useful than coarser 
whole wheat or Graham flour. 

Dishes Made of Cereals — These include porridge and cereal mush, breads, cakes, 
puddings, pies, etc. There are even greater differences among this group of cereal foods 
as they appear on the table than among those from which they are prepared, because they 
are made in so many different ways and combined with so many different things. The cook- 
ing has made them pleasanter to eat. It is commonly believed that they are more readily 
digested cooked than raw. 

Ordinarily more or less water or some other liquid is added in cooking cereals, and 
the water that they thus take up makes them much bulkier and at the same time more dilute. 
One cupful of uncooked oatmeal or rice, for instance, cooked with three cupfuls of water 
gives over four cupfuls when boiled, but the water, which chiefly causes the difference, 
does not give to the entire four cupfuls any more body fuel or building material than was 
in the original cupful. Hence we must not judge the food value of cooked cereals merely 
by the size of the finished dish, but must remember that the raw food material has been 
diluted, so that a cupful cooked may have only a quarter the food value of a cupful of the 
raw grain. The body-building protein, which makes up about one-eighth of the raw grain, 
makes up only about one-fiftieth of the weight of cooked porridge. 

If the cereal were cooked in skim milk, which itself is rich in protein, this valuable 
material would be taken up by the cereal and the cooked dish would be by that much more 
nutritious than if cooked in water. A cupful of rice cooked slowly in a double boiler can 
be made to take up six cupfuls of skim milk, and the amount of tissue-building material 
the cooked dish contains is about four times as great as that of the rice alone. 

In the same way the total food value of bread, cakes, etc., depends on all the ma- 
terials from which they are made. If bread is mixed with water, its food value is about 
like that of the flour which goes into the loaf, for little besides water is added, and almost 
nothing is taken away in making the bread. Measured pound for pound, the bread has a 



I 



CLASS I 7— BREAD— CEREAL FOODS 219 

lower food value than the flour, because it is moister, owing to the water added in mixing 
the dough. If skim milk is used in the place of water in mixing bread, this makes the 
bread richer in body-building material. If a little sugar and fat are added, these make it 
more useful as body fuel. A cake made with two eggs provides more body-building ma- 
terial than one made with one egg, and if nuts and raisins are added, these add to the food 
value as well as to the flavor. 

How Much Cereal Food Should be Used? — Cereal food of one kind or another 
forms a large part of almost every wholesomeand economical diet. As a general rule, the 
greater the part played by cereals the cheaper the diet. Up to a certain point one may 
cut down the quantity of meat, etc., eggs, butter, sugar, fruits, and vegetables used and sub- 
stitute cereal foods, but there is a limit beyond which this can not be safely done. 

Breakfast Cereals — Next to their use in bread, cakes, etc., in this country, the most 
common way of using the cereals for food is in the form of the so-called breakfast foods. 
Sometimes, as in the case of rice, cracked wheat, and old-fashioned or "Scotch" oatmeal, 
the grains are simply husked and perhaps slightly crushed before being cooked. Some- 
times meals are used, as in corn meal mush. Sometimes the gtains are ground rather finely 
and the outside parts sifted out, as in farina. In other cases, as in the rolled-oat prepara- 
tions, the grain is cleaned, partially cooked by steam, and then run between rollers, which 
flatten it out. In still other preparations the partly cooked cereal is ground into fine, granu- 
lar form, or pressed into thin flakes which are baked crisp, or the whole grains are cooked 
under pressure so that they puff or pop up somewhat as does popped corn, which may be 
used as a breakfast cereal as well as in other ways. Many of the devices used in preparing 
such breakfast foods are patented, and the products are often sold under proprietary names 
which may or may not suggest how the grains have been treated. What with all these 
methods of preparations, the list of varieties on the market is a long one, and the range 
of cost is great, especially -when judged by the amount of food material actually supplied 
by a given quantity. All are wholesome foods. 

As has been shown, one can not judge the real cheapness or dearness of different 
kinds merely by the price paid for a package of a given size. Housekeepers who wish to be 
economical should note the net weight, which the law now requires to be marked on every 
package, and from this and the price reckon how much it costs per pound of material. 
They will find that, judged in this way, the simple flours and meals and the uncooked cereals 
(cracked wheat, coarse hominy or samp, unsteamed oatmeal, etc.) are usually the cheapest. 
When a preparation (steam-cooked oats, for example) can be bought either in package or 
in bulk, the cost of the package goods is usually, and quite justly, a little higher. Each 
housekeeper must decide for herself whether the greater convenience and attractiveness of 
the package goods is worth the difference in cost. The larger her family is, and the more 
good storage space she has, the greater will probably be the advantage of buying in bulk. 
If she decides to do this, she should be careful to get cereals which have been kept in 
clean, closed bins or bags and to keep them as carefully after they reach her home. 

Plain, uncooked cereals (cracked wheat, coarse hominy or samp, unsteamed oatmeal, 
etc.) usually cost less than the partially cooked preparations and the partially cooked ones 
less than the ready-to-eat kinds, as seems reasonable since fuel and labor are used in the 
factory where they are made. More or less fuel and labor are also needed to prepare 
cereals in the home, and a wise housekeeper reckons with these in deciding which kind is 
most truly economical in her own case. The coarse, uncooked ones need longer cooking 
than the partially cooked kinds, while the ready-to-eat kinds need no cooking, or only 
enough to make them warm and crisp. In a household where a coal fire is kept in the 
range all day no more fuel and not much more work are required for the long, slow cooking 
of cracked wheat or "Scotch" oatmeal than for factory cooked brands; or where a fireless 



220 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Sec. IV— Pt. 2— COOKING AND RECIPES 

cooker is used such cereals may be easily and cheaply cooked. Where gas, electricity, or 
liquid fuel is used, and it is a matter of economy to plan for as short a use of the stove as 
possible, it may be cheaper to use steam cooked ones. In light housekeeping the conven- 
ience of the ready-to-eat preparations often more than compensates for their high cost. The 
pleasant variety given by the use of cereals manufactured in the more elaborate ways may 
seem to the housekeeper to be worth a few cents extra. It is worth remembering, however, 
that bread and milk, rusks and milk, and crackers and milk all have much the same food 
value as breakfast foods and milk, and often furnish a convenient and inexpensive variety. 

There are several practical points to remember in cooking cereals. One is that there 
is more danger of not cooking them enough than of cooking them too much. Uncooked cereal 
preparations, like cracked wheat and coarse samp, need several hours' cooking, and are 
often improved by being left on the back of the stove or in the fireless cooker overnight. 
Cereals partially cooked at the factory, such as the rolled or fine granular preparations, 
should be cooked fully as long as the directions on the package suggest. 

Flavoring is also an important part of cooking cereals. The flavor most commonly 
added is salt. Such added flavor is perhaps less necessary in some of the ready-to-eat 
kinds w^hich have been browned at the factory and have thus gained the pleasant flavor 
which also appears in the crust of bread and cake or in toast, but in the plain boiled cereals 
or mushes the careful use of salt in cooking them may make all the difference between an 
appetizing and an unpalatable dish. A good general rule is 1 level teaspoonful of salt to 
each quart of water used in cooking the cereal. 

Milk, cream, butter, sugar, or syrup are often added to breakfast cereals when they 
are eaten and make them more palatable to most persons. The materials also add to the 
food value of the whole dish. 

Cereal Left-Overs — Remnants of cereal breakfast foods may often be utilized to make 
palatable dishes, to thicken soups or other foods, and in similar ways. For instance, small 
quantities of cooked cereal left over from a meal can be molded in cups and reheated for 
later use by setting the cups in boiling water. Another w^ay to economize cereal mushes is 
to add hot w^ater to any mush left over so as to make it very thin. It can then easily be 
added to a new supply. The practice of frying the left-overs of boiled hominy or of com 
meal mush is as old as the settlement of this country, and the nursery song about the "bag 
pudding the queen did make" from King Arthur's barley meal shows us that for centuries 
other cereal puddings have been treated in the same way. In so-called oatmeal oysters, left- 
over cereal is dipped in eggs and crumbs and fried. The use of left-over rice and other 
cereals in croquettes, puddings, and so on is too well known to need more than mention. 

Cold Cooked Farina or similar cereal may be utilized in the following ways: The 
second recipe is less economical because of the use of egg and more milk. 

Feurina Pudding No. 1 — One cup cold, cooked farina, Yi cup milk, 1/3 cup sugar, 
'/2 cup seeded raisins, J/^ teaspoon cinnamon, a speck of ground cloves. 
Bake until brown, or heat on top of the stove. 

No. 2 — One cup cold, cooked farina, 1 tablespoon cornstarch, 1 egg, 1 cup milk, 
1/3 cup sugar, Yi cup seeded raisins, J/g teaspoon cinnamon, a speck of ground cloves. 

Bake in a medium oven until brown, or heat on top of the stove. Dried figs or dates 
or stewed fruit may be substituted for the raisins in either of these puddings. 

Boiled Rice and Pearl Barley are often used in soup, and there is no reason why small 
quantities of coarse samp or any other cereal which will keep its shape fairly well, should 
not be used up in the same way. Similarly, remnants of macaroni broken into small pieces 
may be used in the place of vermicelli or other special soup pastes. Such practices serve 



CLASS 17— BREAD — CEREAL FOODS 221 

the double purpose of using material which would otherwise be wasted and of giving a little 
variety to a simple diet by inexpensive means. 

Home Ground Wheat Cereal — In many places good, clean, whole wheat can be 
obtciined quite as easily and cheaply as the common cereal preparations. It is possible to 
grind this in a mill like an ordinary coffee grinder so that it is as fine as old-fashioned cracked 
wheat, or even to a meal fine enough for bread making. When coarsely ground, such home- 
ground wheat makes an excellent breakfast cereal. Bread can be made entirely of the home- 
g^round meal, but it is lighter and more delicate in flavor if half ordinary flour and half wheat 
meal are used. Grinding the grain, of course, takes time, and such home products are not 
recommended to take the place of others entirely. Occasionally, however, and especially 
when bran is needed in the diet they may furnish a wholesome variety at low cost. 

If other cereals cost less than wheat flour, the cost of bread may be lessened by using 
some of them in place of part of the flour. It has been found that good yeast bread can 
be made with corn meal, rice, oatmeal, potatoes, etc., in place of at least one-third of the 
flour.

inch thick, brush over with butter, roll up like a 
jelly roll and cut in small pieces. Put in a pan, 
flat side down, let rise; bake in hot oven. 

Parker House Rolls (Farmers* Bulletin No. 807, 
U. S. Dept. of Agri., on "Bread") — Two cups milk, 
3 tbsp. butter, 2 tbsp. sugar, I teasp. salt, I cake 
compressed yeast, flour. 

Put the butter, sugar, and salt in a mixing 
bowl. Scald the milk and pour it into the bowl. 
When it is lukewarm, add the yeast, mixing it 
with a little of the liquid first. Add 3 cups of 
flour, beat thoroughly, cover, and let the dough 
rise until it doubles its bulk. Cut down the 
dough and add flour gradually until the mixture 
can be molded without sticking either to the hand 
or to the bowl. Let it rise again until about twice 
its original bulk and roll it on a floured board and 
cut it with a biscuit cutter. Brush the pieces 
over with fat, crease each piece through the cen- 
ter with a knife, and fold it over. Let it rise again 
and bake in a hot oven about I 5 minutes. 

Rice Rolls — Heat I cup cooked rise and I cup

shape into balls. Put into greased pan. brush 
tops with butter, cover, and let rise once more. 
Bake 15 to 20 minutes. 

Potato Rolls (Farmers' Bulletin No. 807, on 
"Bread," U. S. Dept. of Agri.)— Very palatable 
rolls can be made from a similar mixture of boiled 
potatoes and flour by adding fat and sugar. The 
following proportions will yield about I doz. small 
rolls: 

8 oz. boiled and peeled potatoes, 6 oz. or \Yl 
cups sifted flour, Yl cake compressed yeast, J^ 
level teasp. salt. 2 tbsp. lukewarm water, milk, 
or cream, 2 tbsp. sugar, 2 tbsp. butter. 

Boil, peel, and mash the potatoes as directed 
for bread making. Add to this the salt, the 
yeast, rubbed smooth and mixed with the water, 
or other liquid, and, lastly, 2 tbsp. flour. Set 
this mixture to rise at about 86° F., and allow it 
to rise till a touch will cause it to fall. Add to 
this sponge the butter, the sugar, and the re- 
mainder of the flour, and, if necessary, enough 
more flour to make a very stiff dough. Knead 
thoroughly until a smooth dough has been formed 
which is no longer sticky. Set back to rise again, 
and, when the dough has trebled in volume, knead 
lightly, form into small balls, and place, not too 
close together, in greased pans. Let rise until 
double in volume and bake 20 minutes in a mod- 
erately hot oven (about 400° F.). 

Cinnamon Rolls — Put a baking powder mix- 
ture on floured board and roll out to !4 inch in 
thickness. Brush over with melted butter, then 
sprinkle with a mixture of 2 tbsp. sugar, Yl teasp. 
cmnamon, 1/3 cup raisons cut in small pieces, and 
2 tbsp. chopped nut meats. Roll like a jelly roll 
and cut into pieces I inch in thickness. Put on

knead; let rise till double its size, shape into 8- 
inch strips and fold into rings, or tie into knots; 
brush over with beaten egg white diluted with a 
little water and sprinkle with a mixture of sugar, 
chopped nuts and shredded candied cherries. 
Bake in moderate oven. 

Bread Sticks — Ordinary bread dough can be 
used. When the dough is light, cut pieces from 
the side and roll under the hands to the length 
of your pan and thickness of a lead pencil. Let 
rise until light. Bake in hot oven and when 
nearly done, brush white of an egg over them. 

Oliver Twists — Roll a piece of light bread 
dough into a thin sheet about (4 inch thick and 
cut into narrow strips about 8 inches long; twist, 
put on greased pan and let stand 1 5 minutes. 
Fry in deep hot fat until they puff light and turn 
a golden brown. Sprinkle with sugar and serve 
hot. 

Buns — Stir to a thick batter 1 cup yeast, I cup 
sugar, and 3 cups milk and let rise; then add 1 
cup sugar, I teasp. soda, J/2 teasp. nutmeg, and 



1 cup butter, I cup currants. Knead until thor- 
oughly mixed; let rise until double its size. Shape, 
brush with melted butter, cover and rise till 
light. Bake in quick oven 20 or 25 minutes. 

Crumpets — Put I teasp. sugar, J/^ teasp. salt, 
and 3 tbsp. melted butter in a mixing bowl, add 

2 cups scalded milk. When lukewarm, add Yz 
cake yeast; when yeast is thoroughly dissolved, 
add 3 cups flour slowly, beating constantly. Let 
stand in a warm place 2 or 3 hours. Bake in 
greased muffin rings on a hot griddle. Fill pans 
half full. 

Prune Kringles — Into 1 lb. dough, knead I 
tbsp. each of butter and sugar. Chop 6 or 8 
prunes, mix with 4 tbsp. sugar. Shape the 
dough into sticks about the size of little finger, 
then roll in the prunes and bake in oblong rings. 

Sugar Kringles are made in the same Vkray, using

In making biscuit handle the dough as Httle as possible; do all the niixing 
with a spoon. 

Biscuits will bake much quicker if put on top of the stove in a skillet. This 
is especially convenient in the summer time, as it makes so much less heat. 

With the increasing use of buttermilk by doctor's orders, there has come 
back in some measure the practice of using it in cooking. Cakes and biscuits are 
delicious prepared with buttermilk. Use one and one-half more buttermilk than 
the meal or flour, mix thoroughly and when smooth add a salt spoon of soda or 
more if a larger quantity of cakes are to be made. Cakes can be made in this way 
with white flour, buckwheat or rye meal. Always use enameled ware for the mix- 
ing, as the acid of the buttermilk easily affects metal.

Griddle Cakes — I teasp. butter added to griddle 
or batter cakes will keep them from sticking to 
the griddle; It is much better than putting it on 
the griddle, where it burns and fills the house 
with smoke. Turn the griddle often to keep heat 
even. Let each cake bake until full of holes and 
dry at the rim; turn only once.

Indian Meal Doughnuts — (Farmers' Bulletin, 
565, on "Corn-Meal," U. S. Dept. of Agri.) — In 
making doughnuts there is a decided advantage 
in substituting corn-meal for part of the flour, for 
doughnuts so made are much more likely to be

In making cake use only the best of material. Have all utensils ready; an 
earthen bowl, a wooden spoon for mixing, a half-pint measuring cup, a dover beater 
for egg yolks, a wire egg whip for the whites and a flour sifter for dry ingredients. 

All measurements are used level. Dry ingredients should be sifted before 
measuring. Sift flour and baking powder after measuring two or three times be- 
fore using. 

Never grease pans when baking sponge or angel food cake. Large loaf 
cakes or fruit cakes should be baked in pans lined with greased paper. For other 
cakes the pan should be greased, using cold lard or butter, dusted over with flour. 

To remove cake from pans, invert pans as soon as taken from the oven into a wire 
netting. If cake sticks to the pan turn upside down and put a damp cloth over the bottom 
for a few minutes. 

To keep cake from burning, sprinkle salt on the bottom of the oven. 

The oven should be ready. The tests are: If a piece of white paper turns a deep 
yellow in 5 minutes the oven is right for cakes with butter; if it turns a light yellow in 5 
minutes it is right for sponge cake. 

To Frost Cake — When cooked frostings are used the cake may be spread when hot or 
cold; when uncooked frostings are used it is best to spread when warm. 

To spread icing smoothly on cake dip the icing knife frequently into hot water. 
When making icing w^hich requires a great deal of beating use a wide mouth pitcher, straight 
from the bottom up, just the right height for the egg beater. Break the whites of the eggs 
into the pitcher, beat until stiff; cook the syrup and gradually pour on the beaten whites 
and stir vigorously with a long spoon. The pitcher is easy to hold and the icing pours 
evenly over the cakes. The pitcher is also good to use for waffles and griddle cake batter. 



SUGGESTIONS for CAKE MAKING 

(Iowa State College of Agriculture) 

1 . Measure or weigh out the exact quantities of all the ingredients to be 
used before beginning to mix the cake. 

2. Sift the flour before measuring. 

3. Add leavening agents to the measured sifted flour. Sift together be- 
fore adding to cake liquids. 

4. Have pans buttered and floured or lined with plain white buttered paper. 

5. Break the eggs into a small bowl, separating the whites from the yolks 
when necessary. 

6. Beat the white of the eggs just before adding the flour to the cake, 
then at the last, fold in the beaten whites. 

7. Test the oven just before mixing the cake. 

229 



230 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Sec. IV— Pt. 2— COOKING AND RECIPES 



MATERIALS 

The choicest materials are necessary: 

1. The fats must be sweet and pure. 

2. Fresh eggs. 

3. Fine granulated sugar. 

' 4. Choice nuts, fruits and flavorings. 

5. Pastry flour or a fine quality of bread flour 
or combination of bread flour and corn starch. 
(Use I part corn starch to 7 parts bread flour, 
or to make one cup of pastry flour use 2 tbsp. 
corn starch plus 14 tbsp. of bread flour.) 

DIRECTIONS FOR BAKING CAKE 

Sponge cake 40-50 minutes, 340 degrees F. 

Butter cake 40-50 minutes, 380 degrees F. 

Small cakes and layer cakes — 25-30 minutes, 
425 to 450 degrees F. 

Molasses drop cakes — 25-30 minutes, 380 de- 
grees F. 

EXPERT INTERPRETATION OF OVEN 
TEMPERATURE 

Slow (meringues and custards) — 250 to 300 
degrees F. 

Slow to medium 300 to 350 degrees F. 

Medium (bread, 20 oz. loaf) — 350 to 360 
degrees F. 

Medium to hot 360 to 400 degrees F. 

Hot — 400 to 450 degrees F. 

Very hot 450 to 500 degrees F. 

DIVISION OF TIME 

First quarter Rise, not brown. 

Second quarter Rise, and begin to brown. 

Third quarter Brown, not rise. 

Fourth quarter — Neither rise nor brown, grow 
firm and shrink away from pan. 

POINTS OF A GOOD CAKE 

A good butter cake is smooth on top and evenly 
browned. Bursting and crackling indicate too 
much flour or too rapid baking. 

Inside of loaf should be slightly moist but not 
sticky. 

Cake should be fine grained and of uniform 
lightness. 

Coarse grained cakes indicate a lack of beat- 
ing, too low an oven temperature, or too much 
baking powder. 

SOME CONVENIENT SUBSTITUTES 
Baking Powder 

Use 2 level teasp. baking powder for each cup 
of flour if no eggs are used. 

When eggs are used, the baking powder is 
decreased. One egg replaces from V4 to V2 teasp. 
baking powder. 



Soda 

Use I teasp. soda to 2 cups thick sour milk. 

Use ]/i teasp. soda to 2 tbsp. lemon juice. 

When sour milk is to be substituted for sweet 
milk, use ]/i teasp. soda to each cup of sour 
milk for sweetening, then use amount of baking 
powder (less 1 teasp. for each cup of milk used) 
given in recipe. 

Sugar 
Brown or powdered sugar should be substituted 
for granulated sugar by weight instead of meas- 
ure. 

Chocolate and Cocoa 

Cocoa should be substituted for chocolate by 
weight instead of by measure. 

When cocoa is substituted for chocolate, butter 
(J/2 tbsp. butter for each oz. or J/^ cup cocoa) 
should be added. 

Bread and Pastry Flour 

To change bread flour to pastry flour, use 2 
level tbsp. cornstarch to replace 2 level tbsp. 
flour in each cupful. 

Fats 

Other fats may be substituted for butter and 
the cost of the cake considerably reduced. 

Equivalent of H Cup Butter — J/2 c"P chicken 
fat; J/2 cup lard, less 1 tbsp.; I/2 cup lard sub- 
stitute, less I J/2 tbsp. ; J4 <^"P butter, plus 3 tbsp. 
lard; J/^ cup butter, plus 3 tbsp. lard substitute; 
J/2 cup cottonseed oil, less I tbsp. 

Use % cup lard or vegetable oil or drippings 
from which water has been driven off, to take tJie 
place of 1 cup butter in a recipe. 

If J/2 cup nuts is added to a recipe which calls 
for 1 cup butter, use only 8 2-3 tbsp. butter. 

If one square chocolate is added to recipe 
which calls for 1 cup butter, use 1 3 tbsp. butter. 

The foregoing suggestions for substitutions are 
compiled from the Cornell Reading Circle leaflet 
on cake making and from various Government 
publications. 

USES FOR LEFT-OVER CAKES 

Cake that is dry may be used in place of bread 
crumbs in a pudding recipe. Less sugar should 
be used if cake crumbs are substituted for bread. 

Slices of stale cake may be arranged in alter- 
nate layers with sliced fruit and covered with a 
soft custard. 

Dry cake may be steamed until moist and 
served hot with a pudding sauce.

Pastry flour makes a much more tender crust than bread flour and will 
require less shortening. 

Lard makes a very tender crust, but butter gives a better flavor. 

Shortening should be thoroughly chilled before using. When it is worked 
into the dough it makes the pastry short and tender, but that which is spread over 
the pastry when rolling out makes it flaky. 

In very warm weather it is better to use a knife or fork to cut or rub shorten- 
ing in, rather than to use the fingers, as the heat from the hands often softens the 
shortening and makes the pastry sticky. 

When rolling out pastry use only enough flour to keep dough from stick- 
ing to the board and pan. 

While mixing pastry keep it as cool as possible; use ice-w^ater when it can 
be obtained. Handle as little as possible. 



RECIPES 



Puff Paste — Use I lb. flour and I lb. unsalted 
butter. Chop fine with a knife in an earthenware 
bowl; to make a stiff paste add a little ice water; 
then turn out of bowl on to baking board or marble 
slab. Beat until flat with rolling pin; do not touch 
with the hands; cut in three, place in a pile, one 
on top of the other, beat flat again, and cut a sec- 
ond time; repeat a third time. Put in ice chest 
6 hours, when it is ready for use. 

Pie Crust — Rub half a cupful of equal parts of 
lard and butter into 2 cupfuls of flour and mix the 
whole as lightly as possible into a stiff paste with a 
little ice water; roll it out, folding the paste over 
each time. 

Apple Pie Peel and core 5 or 6 apples, cut into 

eighths. Line pie tin with half of pie crust, then 
pile on the apples. Cover with a mixture of Yl 
cup of sugar, few gratings of nutmeg, ^ teaspoon 
cinnamon. Dot with butter. Lay top crust over 
and press edges firmly together. Bake 40 to 45 
minutes in moderate oven. 

To glaze top crust brush it over with the yolk 
of an egg to make it a deep brown; yolk and white 
mixed for a lighter brown; milk with a little sugar 
in it for very light glaze. 

Peach Pie Line a pie pan with crust and fill it 

with sliced canned peaches. Pour over the peaches 
a mixture of 1 tablespoonful sugar, Yl teaspoonful 
finely chopped lemon peel. 1 tablespoonful lemon 
juice and 2 or 3 tablespoonfuls of peach juice. 
Cover with crust and bake in hot oven 20 or 30 
minutes or longer if necessary. Fresh peaches can 
be used in the same way, after they are peeled 
and sliced, but more sugar should be used if 
peaches are sour. 



Glazed Peach Pie When nearly done take «ic 

pie out of oven and brush the top with the white 
of an egg beaten to a froth, sprinkle a little sugar 
and a few drops of water on it. Put the pie back 
in oven and finish baking; be careful not to burn 
as it is liable to do when crust is glazed. Serve hot 
or cold. 

Cherry Pie Line a pie pan with crust and fill 

with ripe cherries, stoned. Use sugar to taste. 
Cover with crust and bake 20 to 30 minutes. 

Raspberry, blackberry and plum pie are made in 
the sanie >vay. 

Lemon Pie Mix I cup sugar with 3 tablespoon- 
fuls cornstarch, add 1 cup boiling water slowly 
and cook until clear; then add I teaspoonful but- 
ter, 2 beaten egg yolks and grated rind of Yl 
lemon; cool. Line pie plate with crust, prick the 
bottom with a fork, or use perforated pie pan. 
When crust is light brown pour in the lemon mix- 
ture. Whip the whites of 2 eggs stiff, add 2 table- 
spoonfuls powdered sugar; spread this mixture 
over the top for a meringue: return to oven and 
brown lightly. 

Custard Pie In making custard pies, heat the 

milk for the custard to the boiling point before 
adding to the eggs, and the undercrust will always 
be crisp and light. While pouring the milk into 
the beaten eggs, stir briskly and put into the crust 
while hot. 

Line a deep pie plate with paste. Rub I tea- 
spoonful flour with j/2 cup cold milk until smooth; 
then add it to I '/2 cupfuls scalded milk. Cook 5 
minutes. Beat 3 eggs and combine with '/2 cup 
sugar, Ya teaspoonful salt. Pour milk mixture over 
this, stirring briskly, add Yl teaspoonful flavoring

extract, strain into pie plate. Bake slowly. It is 
done when a knife blade makes a clean cut. 

Lemon Custard — Line a deep pie plate with 
paste, prick it well with a fork and bake in hot 
oven. Set away to cool. Make a filling of 1 1/2 table- 
spoonfuls cornstarch dissolved in a little cold water, 
mix it with 2 eggs, I cup sugar, a pinch of salt and 
stir it all into 2 cupfuls of boiling water. When 
thickened add the juice of 2 lemons and the grated 
rind of one. When mixture has cooled pour it on 
pie crust. 

If spread on top with a meringue brown it very 
lightly in a slow oven. It is also delicious served 
with whipped cream. 

Cocoanut Custard — Beat 2 eggs and 1/2 cup 
sugar together until light, then add 1 pint milk, 
Yz grated nutmeg and I cup grated cocoanut. Line 
2 pie dishes with paste, fill with mixture and bake 
in a quick oven 30 minutes. 

Pumpkin Pie — Mix I cup sifted pumpkin, Yi 
teaspoonful salt, 1 saltspoonful mace and Yl ^^3' 
spoonful cinnamon together; beat t egg and mix 
with 2/3 cup sugar; pour Yl "^"P scalded milk and 
Yi cup scalded cream slowly into the egg and sugar 
and then combine with pumpkin mixture and pour 
into a deep pie plate lined with paste. Bake 35 to 
40 minutes. Squash may be used instead of pump- 
kin. 

A good substitute for eggs in pumpkin pies are 
soda crackers rolled fine, allowing two for each 
pie. 

Cranberry Pie — Cook I Yl cupfuls cranberries in 
Yl cup water and % cup sugar for 1 minutes, 
then cool. Line pie pan vtrith crust, fill with cran- 
berries, and place strips of crust across the top. 
Bake 30 minutes in moderate oven. 

Mince Pie — Cook 4 lbs. lean beef 3'/2 hours. 
Remove gristle and bone and chop fine when cold. 
Add 1 pint of the liquor to chopped meat; mix

spoonfuls salt, 2 pounds sugar, 2 pounds raisins, 
I pound currants, Yl pound shredded citron, juice 
and grated rind of 3 oranges and lemons, 4 tea- 
spoonfuls cinnamon, 2 teaspoonfuls mace, I tea- 
spoonful cloves, 1 quart boiled cider, 5 quarts 
chopped apple. Cook together 30 minutes. Seal 
in jars and keep in cool place. This makes 8 
quarts of mince meat. 

When ready to use, make upper and lower crust, 
fill, and bake in moderate oven. 

Apple Tarts — Peel and core apples and dice thin; 
sprinkle with sugar and cinnamon and pile on pans 
lined •with puff paste about Y'l inch thick; then dot 
with bits of butter. Cover the top with strips of 
paste and bake in moderate oven until browned. 

Instead of the strips of paste, a meringue may 
be heaped on top and lightly browned in oven. 
Most fruit tarts may be cooked in this way.

over the fruit.

milk, 1 egg, j/^ teaspoonful cornstarch, I teaspoon-

Ice cream is one of the most nutritious of desserts and easy of digestion. 

The term "ice cream" covers a large number of mixtures of different food 
value. Pure plain ice cream without eggs or fruit contains a high percentage of 
fat and sugar, but low in protein, while some so-called ice creams have no milk 
or sugar in them. If the housewife would know what proportion of fat, sugar or 
protein she is serving her family in her iced desserts, they would be made at home; 
and because of the large variety of frozen dishes which is limited only by the imag- 
ination, the food contents of her dessert may be selected in relation to that of the 
meal with which it is to be served. 

When made at home ice cream is more economical than when bought from 
a caterer, and the housewife can be sure also of the purity and cleanliness of the 
ingredients. 

A freezer of standard make and of simple design, together with the habit of fol- 
lowing a few simple rules will greatly lessen the trouble of frozen desserts. Have the freezer 
can and the mixture to go in it cold; the ice crushed and mixed with coarse salt to the pro- 
portion of one salt to two of ice. Pour cold mixture into cold can, cover tightly, adjust 
can in freezer, pack around the sides ■with ice and salt. If freezer is packed '/2 hour be- 
fore mixture is put in, the can is ice cold and the freezing is much speedier. Turn crank 
constantly until cream is nearly frozen. Put in any fruit or extra flavoring, as grapefruit. 
Have the fruit crushed and stir in well. Cover can, finish freezing. Remove dasher, pack 
ice cream with a spoon, cover. Add extra ice, draw water off, replug, cover freezer with 
newspaper and set aside until time to serve. 

When ready to clean freezer, wash the can and dasher with boiling soapy water; 
rinse in hot water adding 1 teasp. borax. Dry thoroughly, air, and put away from dust 
until ready to use again.

PICKLES 

(Food Preservation: A National Challenge, Cornell Reading Course) 

It is the custom with such vegetables as tomatoes and cucumbers to soak them in 
brine before putting them through the regular pickling process. The brine is probably used 
because it withdraws moisture from the tissue of the vegetable and makes it possible to 
obtain a firmer product, renders a milder flavor, gives the desired salt taste, and adds to 
the keeping quality of the pickle. Some persons prefer to omit the treatment with brine. 
The strength of brine required depends on the length of time the vegetable to be pickled 
is to remain in the brine. Too strong a brine softens and spoils the vegetable. Brine may 
be made by adding 1/3 to J/2 cupful of salt to I qt. of water. Such brine should be strong 
enough to float a fresh egg. 

Grape leaves and cabbage leaves are said to help in retaining the natural green color 
of cucumbers and unripe tomatoes. The bottom and sides of the kettle are lined with 
leaves, the kettle is then filled with the mixture to be pickled, and the top of the mixture 
is covered with leaves. "Greening" vegetables by cooking them in copper kettles is dan- 
gerous. If copper utensils are used at all, they must be scrupulously clean. 



RECIPES 



TWO VINEGAR MIXTURES for pickles are as 
followrs: 

Recipe 1. 1 qt. vinegar, I '/2 teasp. whole black 

peppers, I l/i teasp. celery seed, I Yz teasp. allspice,

mustard seed. I J/2 tbsp. cinnamon bark, ^ teasp. 
grated horseradish. 

Recipe 2. — I qt. vinegar, Yl °^- ginger, I teasp. 
mace, I oz. small onions, 1/3 oz. mustard seed. 
If pickles have not been soaked in brine, use 

2 oz. of salt. 

Cucumber Pickles — Soak cucumbers in brine for 
24 hours, then rinse and drain them. Cover them 
with vinegar or vinegar mixture to %vhich has been 
added I tablespoonful of brown sugar for each 
quart of vinegar. Bring them slowly to the boiling 
point. Pack the pickles in a jar, and cover them 
with vinegar. 

Sweet Cucumber Pickles — Soak cucumbers in 
brine for 24 hours. Rinse, drain, and wipe them 
dry. Place them in a kettle, and cover them with 
the following vinegar mixture: I quart vinegar, I 
cupful sugar, 8 whole cloves, 6 allspice, 6 blades 
mace, 8 whole black peppers. Heat the pickles 
slowly to the boiling point, and pack them at once. 



Quick Pickles — Put cucumbers in strong brine 
(l/z to ^ cupful of salt to I quart of water). 
Bring them slowly to the boiling point, and simmer 
them for 5 minutes. Drain off the brine, cover 
them with cold water, and change it as it becomes 
warm. Keep changing the water until the pickles 
are crisp and cold. Cover them with a vinegar 
mixture made by either of the two preceding 
recipes. 

Mustard Pickle — 2 qts. cucumbers, 2 qts. green 
tomatoes, 2 qts. cauliflower, 2 qts. small onions, 
1/2 lb. mustard, J/2 cupful flour, 6 cupfuls brown 
sugar, I green pepper, cut fine, 2 qts. vinegar. 

Cut up the vegetables, and scald them in salt 
water (1 qt. water to J/J cupful salt), then drain 
them well. Mix the mustard, the flour, the sugar, 
and the pepper, add the vinegar, and boil the mix- 
ture for 10 minutes. Pour the mixture over the 
chopped pickle while it is boiling hot, and seal 
the pickle in scalded jars. 

Dill Pickles — To each qt. of water allow 2 tbsp. 
salt; boil 5 minutes. When cold pack the pickles 
in jars with dill between. Fill with the brine, 
cover and keep in a cool place. It may be nec- 
essary to wash the pickles and pour fresh brine 
over at intervals.

It is a wise economy to purchase spices of the highest quality only, as the ground 
spices in particular offer a tempting medium for adulteration. Only a very small quantity of 
a pure spice will be required to impart a fine, delicate fragrance to food. 

Mustards and peppers should not be used to excess. Cloves, cinnamon, cassia, all- 
spice, nutmeg, mace, caraway, aniseed, etc., when used in moderation encourage appetite 
and relish for food and also help digestion. Physiologists state that the aromatic bodies 
when absorbed into the blood relieve and prevent nervous depression and "lowness" of 
spirits.

To make dainty appetizing sandwiches takes less time and material than some house- 
wives realize. 

For the home luncheon, sandwiches offer the opportunity of both using an occa- 
sional left over and of providing a very substantial addition to the meal, and for tea or 
luncheon they may be made to add the spice or relish so necessary to the 



Besides the most convenient white bread for sand- 
wiches, there is brown, Graham, whole wheat, rye, 
raisin, nut bread, rolls, beaten biscuit, crackers 
and even cornbread, and for a filling foundation, 
fish, meats, some vegetables, eggs, cheese, nuts, 
sweets, spices and pickles. 

Some sandwiches require that the bread used 
be fresh, others are better made with bread a day 
old. A very sharp knife is needed for slicing 
either. For rolled sandwiches take a long slim 
loaf of fresh bread, stand on end and slice thin, 
lengthwise. If a round or fancy shaped cutter 
is used more sandwiches may be gotten from bread 
sliced lengthwise than crosswise; but for square 
shapes, cut across the end of a loaf. 

For home luncheon if bread is very fresh it need 
not be trimmed of crusts, but it must be remem- 
bered that crusts may always be used to advantage 
either chopped into small pieces and browned for 
soup croutons, or dried, and ground into crumbs. 

A quick way to trim off crusts is to go around 
each slice with large scissors, or with a sharp 
knife, trim down a pile of slices all about the 
same size. This should be done before the filling 



le menu. 

is put in as bits of the filling left on the crusts 
will prevent them from being used to advantage. 

Time is also saved by creaming the butter and 
either spreading on each slice before it is cut from 
the loaf, or by using a small flexible knife to spread 
it on the trimmed cut slices. 

When creaming the butter any flavoring in- 
tended to be used in the filling may be combined 
at this time, either chopped olives, anchovy es- 
sence, sardine or salmon, chives, parsley, paprika 
or caviar. 

When making a meat sandwich it is sometimes 
well to remember just which relish is most suit- 
able for the meat to be used. Cold roast beef is 
always nicer with a bit of grated horseradish; cold 
pork, chili sauce; cold lamb, chopped capers; veal, 
tomato sauce; chicken and other fowl, salad dress- 
ing. 

Sandwiches to which French dressing is added 
should be eaten directly after they are put to- 
gether before the dressing soaks into the bread. 
Other sandwiches may be kept fresh for several 
hours by wrapping them in waxed paper or in a 
dampened napkin and placing where it is cool. 



APPETIZING SANDWICHES 

(Iowa State College Bulletin) 

Bread for sandwiches should be at least 24 hours old, cut in slices of uniform thick- 
ness and spread with creamed butter. Both slices should be buttered, as butter keeps the 
bread moist and prevents filling from soaking into the bread. 

The filling material adds to the food value of the sandwich. Any food capable of 
being mashed, finely ground, or thinly sliced is suitable for filling. It should be spread on 
one side of the buttered bread, the other side fitted to this and the sandwiches cut in dainty, 
convenient shape. 

The crusts should not be removed from noon lunches. For afternoon functions the 
sandwiches are more dainty with crusts removed. 

Sandwiches are served at noon and school luncheons, afternoon and evening parties, 
picnics, and informal entertainments.

bread slices buttered, with peach marmalade; cover 
with a slice of whole wheat bread spread with 
cream cheese, top with white bread buttered. 

Nuts — Nuts contain a great deal of fat and pro- 
tein, but very little water, so the finer nuts are 
chopped and mashed the more rapid will be their 
digestibility. 

To crack pecans and walnuts, let them stand in 
boiling water several hours. Crack the nuts gently 
around the sides, the meats will generally come 
out whole and without the bitter dark skin. 

To blanch almonds, shell and throw kernels into 
boiling water 5 minutes. Drain, pour cold water 
over. The skins will then rub off easily. Wipe 
dry, and cool before chopping. 

The Soy Bean, being so rich in fat responds sat- 
isfactorily to roasting. If carefully and properly 
done it is found to have a sweet nutty flavor and 
may be used in recipes in the place of almonds 
and peanuts. 

To roast soy beans, soak over night or longer 
in salted water. Drain and parboil in other water 
1 hour. Drain again and place in a roasting pan 
in a hot oven with the door open. Watch con- 
stantly and stir to keep from scorching. When 
done they are a rich brown.

Cocoanut Prize Sandwich — Soak dry shredded 
cocoanut in a little sweet milk, a few minutes. 
Drain, lay on unsalted buttered crackers or home- 
made cracker-thin squares of pastry. Spread with 
sweet butter. Sprinkle powdered sugar over cocoa- 
nut. Top with a marshmallow and melt it under 
oven flame; or; mix the sweetened cocoanut with 
marshmallow cake filling, spread on the pastry, and 
serve uncovered.

very fine, preserved Canton ginger. Make a smooth 
thick syrup of white sugar, I teasp. vinegar, I 
teasp. ground ginger, lump of butter. When partly 
cool add chopped nuts and minced preserved gin- 
ger. Spread before it cools on crackers or sweet 
wafers. 

Stewed Fruit Sandwiches — I . Thick stewed 
rhubarb sweetened and spread when cool on thin 
white buttered bread is delicious. This is improved 
by adding a slice of whole wheat bread covered 
with cream cheese. Top with white bread. 

2. Stewed apricots, prunes or any stewed fruit 
mashed, laid on thin bread slices, sprinkled with 
sugar and topped with whipped cream make a 
dainty afternoon sandwich.

dates, dust with powdered sugar, mix with ground 
nuts and chopped apples. Lay on slices of but- 
tered whole wheat bread. Sprinkle lemon juice 
over, or mayonnaise; top with buttered bread.

Fruits and Bcrrks

The importance of plenty of fruit for every day food the year around cannot be 
too greatly emphasized. The health of the body is dependent on their phosphates, fruit 
sugars and organic acids, which no other food supplies so well. 



Some fruits, as oranges and lemons, may be 
found on the market every season, other fruits if 
not always found fresh may be had canned or 
dried. The valuable elements of both the orange 
and lemon are similar. Lemon juice is more acid, 
it is cooling, quenches the thirst and enters the 
blood in alkaline citrates. Its aroma and flavor 
make it especially liked as a basis of many fruit 
drinks and desserts. 

The orange is a rapid upbuilder and cleanser 
and has an even more delicious flavor and aroma. 
It contains citric acid, which is a liver stimulant 
and a gentle laxative. It also has a large supply 
of phosphates, a direct nerve food. 

The pineapple, rich in sugars, fragrance and a 
certain ferment which is a great aid to digestion, 
combines most pleasantly with other fruits. it 
is to be had at any time either fresh or canned 
and unlike some others it loses very little, if any 
of its natural flavor by canning. 

Bananas when unripe are rich in starch and best 
for cooking: ripe bananas are very nourishing. 

Cranberries and rhubarb, next to the lemon, con- 
tain so much acid that a very little of their juice 
is needed to impart a high flavor to desserts. 
Their qualities are especially favorable to prevent 
excessive bacterial growth in the intestines, the 
great enemy to good health. 



The strawberry, raspberry, blackberry, peach, 
pear, and sweet apple all yield a fragrant cooling 
sub-acid juice, laxative and tonic in effect and add 
variety to a drink or fruit dish by their penetrating 
and pleasing flavor and color. 

The juice of the grape, containing 10 to 26 per 
cent of sugar is a source of energy, because of this 
high sugar percentage, and is easily digested since 
all fruit sugars, unlike cane sugar, is predigested. 

Raisins are the fruit of the grape dried. Lack- 
ing the water of the fresh grape, they are a con- 
centrated food filled with fattening, easily digested 
sugars, and minerals and organic acids in fair 
amounts. These tend to check intestinal fermen- 
tation and are highly influential in maintaining 
good health. Raisins of good quality are a whole- 
some addition to any meal, served either as a sep- 
erate dish or incorporated in a dessert. 

In preparing such fruits as plums, peaches, etc.. 
for the table, the skin may be readily removed 
without injury to the flavor by first immersing them 
for a short time in boiling hot water. 

A silver knife should always be used for paring 
apples, pears and other fruits; if a steel knife is 
used the acid of the fruit acts on the iron of the 
knife and frequently causes a black discoloration, 
and there is also a noticeable metallic flavor.

SOME TESTS USED IN SUGAR COOKERY 

(Iowa State College Bulletin, "Cake") 

238° to 242° F. Soft Ball The stage at which a little of the sirup dropped into cold water may 

be formed into a soft ball that will just hold its shape in the fingers. Used in making icing, taffy, 
fudge, pinoche and fondant. 

248° F. (about) Firm Ball The stage at which the sirup tested as above will form a firm ball in 

the fingers. Used in making divinity, sea-foam, and pop-corn balls. 

290° F. (about) Crack or Brittle The stage at which sirup becomes brittle immediately upon being 

dropped into cold water. Used in making butter scotch, glace nuts and taffy. 

254° to 345° F. Caramel — The stage at which sirup turns a dark yellow color and snaps like thin 
glass when cooled. Used in making nut brittle, and caramel syrup used for flavoring. 

To caramelize sugar melt dry in sauce pan or add small amount of water and boil until dark yel- 
low in color. The latter method requires a little less attention. To prepare caramel sirup, add as much 
boiling water as sirup, boil until smooth and store In bottles. 

Icings, fondant and other confections should be made on a clear day if possible, since a damp at- 
mosphere interferes with proper hardening. If the work must be done on a damp day, the cooking should 
be carried a little farther in each case. Fondant that has become a little too dry to handle may be re- 
stored by placing oiled paper over the candy and wrapping the dish in a moist towel. 

Fondant is the basis for many different confections and may be used also for dipping small cakes 
and frosting larger ones. A great variety of candies may be made from fondant by combining it with dif- 
ferent kinds of fruit and nuts, by using different flavorings and colorings and by moulding it into dif- 
ferent shapes.

heavy, add strips and cook until pieces are clear, 
lifting pieces from time to time that they may not 
stick to pan. Remove to plate to cool and roll 
each piece separately in powdered or granulated 
sugar. When entirely cool store in glass jars. 



CLASS 29— CANDIES— RECIPES 



271 



CANDY RECIPES— GENERAL 



Uncooked Candy: Plain White Fondant — Have 

all ingredients prepared and utensils ready before 
beginning to make the candy. Roll the sugar until 
smooth, blanch the nuts, seed the dates or raisins, 
melt the chocolate, and beat the whites of eggs if 
necessary. 

1. To make uncooked candies use confectioner's 
sugar or ordinary pulverized sugar. Roll until 
smooth on the bread board. Beat slightly whites 
of eggs with 2 tbsp. cold water. Stir in enough 
sugar to make a smooth stiff paste. 

2. Cream I/3 cup butter, beat in Yl cup sifted 
or rolled confectioner's sugar, add I teasp. boiling 
water, stir in more sugar, add I Ya teasp. boiling 
water, again more sugar until stiff enough to 
knead. 

3. Beat slightly I egg white with a pinch of salt, 
add the rolled sugar gradually until ready to form 
into shapes. 

4. Flavoring or coloring should be worked into 
the paste last. 

The above will serve as a foundation for many 
different varieties of candies, as the center of 
chocolate creams or stuffing for dates. It may be 
formed into shapes resembling any French candies. 
The balls of paste may be worked around nuts, 
chopped fruits or preserved fruits, marshmallows 
or creamed cocoanut. 

Chocolate Creams — Form white fondant into 
little balls size of a marble put aside to harden on 
waxed paper. Heat some confectioner's dipping 
chocolate, by cutting it in small pieces and putting 
in a pan over hot water. When melted cool, and 
either beat it to the consistency of molasses or mix 
in enough beaten white of egg to make a smooth 
thick paste. Dip the fondant balls into the choco- 
late paste until no white shows. A fork, a long 
straw or a wire, shaped like a spoon, or even the 
fingers, may be used to dip and remove the choco- 
late creams. Put aside to cool on heavy paraffin 
paper. 

Fruit and Nut Creams — Press halves of English 
walnuts on each side of a ball of flavored fondant, 
or knead ground nut-meats into the paste and roll 
into balls, decorate ^vith a nut, or tiny piece of 
candied fruit. To cover the fondant balls with 
chopped cocoanut dip first into slightly beaten 
white of egg then into the cocoanut. 

Chop citron, dates, figs, currants, candied orange 
peel, raisins or any candied fruit to make fruit 
creams. Knead fruit into the fondant, form into 
balls, or flat bars, and set aside to harden. 

Fancy Midget Candies (Uncooked) — Roll out 
fresh fondant to '/^ inch thickness flavored first 
with wintergreen or peppermint, cinnamon, 
almond, ginger, extract and colored if desired with 



fruit coloring. Cut the rolled out paste into small 
rounds roll in granulated sugar. 

Cooked — Melt 1/2 cup red currant jelly in pan. 
add 1 cup sugar, boil until it spins a thread, add 3 
tbsp. gelatine dissolved in % cup cold water and 
I tbsp. rose extract. Pour into shallow buttered 
pan, sprinkle with chopped pistachio nuts. When 
cold and firm cut into small rounds and roll in rose 
colored sugar. 

To Salt Peanuts and Almonds (To Blanch Nuto) 

— Cover raw peanuts or almonds with cold water, 
bring just to the boiling point, drain and slip skint 
from the nuts by pressing between thumb and fore- 
finger. Dry thoroughly on paper. Heat oil or 
butter or any clear vegetable cooking fat until it 
will brown a bit of bread in 30 seconds. Dip the 
nuts a few at a time in the oil and quickly remove 
when a faint light brown. Spread on brown paper 
and sprinkle lightly with fine salt. 

To Salt Walnuts, Pecans and Filberb — These are 
harder to blanch than almonds and peanuts, but 
proceed in the same way. After skins are re- 
moved, dry several hours, beat an egg white and 
rub each nut lightly with it; sprinkle with fine 
salt, lay on paraffin paper and slightly brown in a 
slow oven. 

Candied Orange or Grape Fruit Peel — Put the 

peel from 4 oranges in boiling water, boil till ten- 
der, changing the water twice. Drain. Scrape 
out the white part, cut the yellow pieces in strips, 
weigh, and to every lb. of peel use 1 lb. sugar, Yi 
cup water. Cook water and sugar until it spins a 
thread, add peel, simmer until transparent. Drain, 
roll each piece in sugar, dry in warm oven. Crape 
fruit peel may be candied the same way. 

Fruit Paste — I . Grind in the food chopper I 
cup each of seeded raisins, dates, figs, and enough 
nuts to make Ya cup ground. Add I tbsp. brown 
sugar mixed with 1 tbsp. orange juice. Roll this 
paste into a long round stick 1 inch in diameter. 
Put on the bread board dusted with powdered sugar 
and cut the roll into candies Ya inch thick. Sugar 
coat each one and put away to keep in a tin box. 

2. Boil 2 cups sugar, I cup milk, 2 tbsp. butter 
together until it will form a soft ball when dropped 
in cold water. Add 1 lb. of chopped fruit, raisins, 
dates or figs, and I cup chopped nuts. Beat until 
creamy. Knead till stiff, roll and cut in same way 
as No. I, or shape into a loaf and slice when 
needed. ' 

Stuffed Dates, Figs or Prunes — Make a mixture 
of I egg white, Ya cup orange juice, I teasp. 
lemon juice and enough powdered sugar to form 
a paste, or use a plain fondant. Work into the 
paste, chopped nut meats. Add preserved ginger 



2 72 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Sec. IV— Pt. 2— COOKING AND RECIPES 



or Maraschino cherries, marshmallows, bits of pre- 
served fruit or even a little peanut butter. Stuff 
the dates, figs or prunes with this paste and roll 
them in granulated sugar. 

Fruit Kisses — Beat 1 or 2 egg wrhites very stiff, 
add I cup brown sugar or white powdered sugar, 
'/^ teasp. flavoring. Add I cup chopped nuts or 
candied fruits, dates or figs, or 1 cup of both. 
The kisses must be of the consistency to drop 
stiffly off the spoon on to a buttered pan. Place 
them several inches apart and bake in a slow oven 
until lightly browned. 

Panacha or Mexican Kisses — Mix 1 lb. dark 
brown sugar with J/2 cup cream in a pan over the 
fire. Stir until it boils. Cook to a soft ball. Re- 
move from fire and stir in I cup of unbroken pecan 
meats. When the sugar becomes granulated drop 
the candy in little flat cakes on waxed paper. 

Peanut Bars — Beat together in the order men- 
tioned I cup minced roasted peanuts, I stiff egg 
white, I cup brown sugar, Ya teasp. salt, Yl teasp. 
vanilla. Spread on a buttered pan. Bake in a 
slow oven. Cut in bars. 

Opera Creams — Mix well 3 cups sugar, I cup 
of top cream from a qt. of milk, Yi teasp. cream 
of tartar. Cook without stirring until a soft ball 
may be formed in cold water. Pour into a deep 
warm bowl. When nearly cool, beat till creamy, 
knead on a board till smooth, dredge the board 
with powdered sugar if the candy sticks. Nut 
meats or chopped fruits may be put in while knead- 
ing, or roll paste into bonbons and decorate with 
nuts or bits of candied fruits. 

Peppermints and Winlergreen Candies — 1 . Heat 
Yl cup milk or thin cream, 2 cups sugar, 5 drops 
of oil of peppermint, or essence of wintergreen. 
Stir until dissolved, then boil for 3 minutes without 
stirring, then beat until creamy. When cooling, 
drop on waxed paper. 

2. Make a stiff paste by beating together con- 
fectioner's sugar and 2 tbsp. cream, 6 drops of 
essence of peppermint or wintergreen. Make into 
flat balls topped with a walnut meat; or, roll the 
candy out lightly and cut with a sharp cutter about 
the size of a fifty-cent piece. 

Lemon Drops — Stir over a hot (ire until thor- 
oughly heated, 1 cup sugar, 2/3 cup water, 1 
teasp. cream of tartar. Then boil briskly until 
candy is hard and brittle if dropped in cold water. 
Add I tbsp. lemon juice or extract, boil up once 
to distribute evenly the lemon, pour into buttered 
plates. When cool enough to handle form into 
drops, sticks or thin squares. Handle as little as 
possible to prevent destroying the transparency 
of the candy. 



Butter Scotch Boil quickly 1 cup brown sugar, 

2/3 cup water, 1 tbsp. vinegar, 1 tbsp. butter, 
until it becomes brittle when dropped in cold 
water. Pour into buttered pans when cold, break 
into pieces. 

Maple Horehound — To I pint water add a light 
cupful of horehound herbs. Boil 30 minutes, 
strain, pressing juice from herbs. Add to this 
liquid 3 cups brown, or maple sugar. As it boils 
up put in Ya teasp. cream of tartar and boil until 
very brittle in cold water, add 1 tbsp. butter or 
less, and pour out on a Hat greased dish. When 
nearly cold cut into squares or tiny rounds with 
a sharp cutter. 

Chocolate Caramels — I . Cook together I cup 
sugar, Yl cup milk, Yl cup butter. Stir until it 
forms a soft ball in cold water. Add I cup mo- 
lasses and cook until it forms a very firm ball

Popcorn Candy — The popcorn must be freshly 
popped to use in candies or it will taste tough. 
To secure snow white fluffy popcorn kernels, put 
only enough corn grains in tKe popper to cover 
the bottom, hold high over a hot flame shaking 
all the time so the kernels will not scorch. The 
popped corn may be sprinkled with melted butter 
and salt while hot, or sugared in different ways. 

1. Plain Sugared: — Boil until it threads I cup 
sugar, Yl teacup water. Pour over about 3 qts. 
popped corn. 

2. Colored For yellow flavor the syrup with 

lemon or orange; for red or pink, flavor with rose 
extract, beet juice or cranberry juice; for green, 
crushed spinach leaves will bring enough juice to 
color the syrup. 

3. Chocolate Sugared — Make a syrup of I cup 
sugar, 1 square chocolate, Yl teasp. butter, |/^ cup 
water; or, I cup sugar, ^ cup corn-syrup, I oz. 
chocolate, Yl cup water. When it threads flavor 
with vanilla and pour over 3 qts. popped corn, 
stir well. 

Popcorn Kisses — With a very sharp chopper, cut 
up fluffy popped corn kernels. Use only crisp 
ones. If necessary put them through a meat 
chopper with I cup nutmeats. Beat 3 egg whites 
very stiff, stir in sugar to the proportion of Yi 
cup po^vdered sugar to I egg white to be used 
with 1/3 cup chopped corn, 1/3 cup nutmeats. 
Beat the sugar into the whites for 5 minutes. Add 
a little at a time the nutmeats and popcorn. Mix

ter is put in. 



Fudge Made with Canned Milk — Put into a cook- 
ing pan 2 cups sugar, 2 squares of bitter choco- 
late, butter size of an egg, about 2/3 cup canned 
milk. Boil this until a little dropped in cold water 
will form a soft ball. Take off the fire, add 1 teasp. 
vanilla and stir until thick. Pour into buttered 
pans, cut into squares. Chopped nutmeats may be 
added as the candy begins to thicken. 

Many delicious cream candies are made by us- 
ing canned milk with a little additional water to 
the recipes calling for milk, or plain canned milk 
in place of cream. Only the best brands of canned 
milk should ever be used.

Afternoon Tea — The charm of a cup of tea, or any hot drink lies first in its delicate 
brew, and steaming hotness, second in its dainty service. 

Select green tea, or Orange Pekoe, or one of the Ceylon teas. Pour boiling water 
over the leaves in a hot tea pot, using one slight teasp. tea leaves to each cup water. Al- 
low it to remain a few minutes, until the tea is the strength to suit. Strain into thin cups. 
Serve, with an attractive garnish, as thin slices of lemon, bits of crystallized ginger, or mar- 
aschino cherries, and accompanied by lemon wafers, dainty sandwiches or cakes, sugar and 
cream. 

A more delicate flavor may be secured by pouring the boiling water over the tea in 
a tea-ball. This is more convenient for some, and is thought to be more economical. 

When arranging a proper equipment for an afternoon tea table, simplicity and dainti- 
ness should characterize it. Use a table just high enough for convenience in serving and 
large enough to hold the few necessary things without crowding. The tray may contain 
the swinging kettle of boiling water, the teapot, the tea balls and dish, the cream and sugar. 
This leaves room on the table for a tasteful arrangement of any other China, linen or silver 
necessary, cups, saucers, and small plates for sandwiches, and garnishes if served. All linen 
used should be the daintiest one has, the silver, the best; and the China the most attractive. 

RECIPES— GENERAL 



Coffee — Good coffee making is an art that seems 
difficult for some to acquire. Several points must 
be carefully noted and followed to always get 
good results. 

1. Keep the coffee pot s^veet and clean. Wash 
as soon after using as possible. Once a week fill 
2/3 with water, add I tbsp. baking soda, boil I 
hr. rinse and wipe clean. 

2. Select a good brand of coffee that will al- 
ways be the same blend. A popular mixture is 
2/3 Java 1/3 Mocha. 

3. Use fresh water. Water that has been boiled 
long becomes flat and stale and does not unite with 
the coffee in a delicious blend. 

4. Decide on one method of making coffee and 
make it carefully each time. 

Boiled Coffee — Have medium fine ground coffee. 
Allow I heaping tbsp. to each cup water and 1 
extra tbsp. coffee for the pot. Put the coffee in 
pot add the quantity of cold water, I cup to each 
person served and one extra. Bring to a boil. To 
get the full strength from the coffee let it boil until 
it is as strong as desired, or; let boil up three times. 
Remove to a hot electric plate, settle with dash of 



cold water or crushed egg shells. Never let hot 
coffee stay on the coffee grounds when settled. 
Pour off into a hot urn and serve. 

Drip Coffee — For this method the coffee must 
be ground very fine, almost to a powder. Use only 
I teasp. coffee to a cup, and one extra for the pot, 
being half as much as for boiled coffee. Put coffee 
in a piece of clean cheese cloth, pour boiling water 
through it slowly. This makes a very delicate 
coffee and clear. 

Percolator Coffee — Put medium fine ground 
coffee in upper part percolator, 1 tbsp. to each 
cup and I tbsp. extra. Put the boiling water in 
lower part of percolator. Cover. Place over fira 
and let water percolate up through the coffee. 
Test its strength by pouring a little out into a cup. 
When just right set aside to settle. Serve. 

After Dinner Coffee — When coffee is sewed for 
after dinner or at the afternoon tea hour it should 
be of extra strength and diluted with hot water to 
suit individual tastes. 

To make Vienna coffee, serve it with whipped 
cream piled in each cup.

Cafe au lait is made of equal parts of strong 
coffee and hot milk added either at time of mak- 
ing or when it is poured. 

Serve buttered hot Sally Lunn with hot afternoon 
coffee, or toasted and buttered raisin bread, coffee 
cake, frosted ginger bread, wafers, cake or savory 
sandwiches. 

A Good Cereal Beverage — This is especially 
palatable and nourishing for children for whom a 
hot drink is desired. They should never be given 
tea, coffee, or even cocoa which is really a food 
and too heavy for even an adult as a drink. 

Take 3 lbs. whole wheat, I lb. whole barley, 
1 cup ground chickory, 3 tbsp. molasses, 3 tbsp. 
butter. Roast wheat and barley till brown, stir- 
ring constantly to avoid scorching. Roast separ- 
ately as they vary in time required. When as dark 
as roasted coffee, add butter and molasses to the 
two together, stirring all until grains are dry and 
are separated. Remove from oven, and virhen cold 
add the chickory. Grind in coffee mill. 

To make: Use 2 tbsp. to I !/2 cups cold water 
per person. Boil gently 1 hour. Serve with sugar 
and cream or milk. 

Spiced Cocoa Scald I qt. milk. Melt 3 heap- 
ing tbsp. cocoa, 3 tbsp. sugar, few grains salt, in 
J/2 cup boiling water until smooth. Add remain- 
ing J/2 cup boiling water, boil up once. Combine 
this with the scalded milk. Add J/2 teasp. vanilla, 
1/2 teasp. cinnamon. Beat well, serve very hot 
with whipped cream. Pass vanilla wafers, mac- 
aroons or lady lingers. 

Chocolate Chocolate or cocoa should be made 

rich and Jbeaten vigorously to mix the chocolate 
well and to prevent formation of scum. 

1. Mix j/3 cup grated chocolate or cocoa with 
J/3 cup sugar. Stir smooth in 1 cup boiling water. 
Add I more cup water and put on to boil a few 
minutes. Add 3 cups rich milk, boil up once, 
beat hard for a minute. A beaten egg may be 
added to give more body and richness. Serve hot 
with spoonful whipped cream to each cup. Marsh- 
mallow cream may be substituted or 2 marsh- 
mallows to a cup. Serve with cinnamon toast. 

2. A simple rule for two or three cups chocolate 
is I teasp. grated chocolate to 1 teasp. sugar and 
1 cup milk; adding I cup boiling w^ater to the pot. 
Boil up several times, beat, serve. 

Hot Mulled Cider Heat 1 qt. cider to boiling 

point. Pour it slowly over 3 beaten eggs and Yi 
cup sugar. Beat well. Bring again to a boil. Re- 
move and serve in glasses heated in warm vvrater 
to prevent cracking. 

For spiced cider add J/2 teasp. sv^reet whole spices 
before bringing to a boil. Remove spices before 
serving. 

Iced Drinks or Unfermented Drinks — For a cool- 
ing drink during the warm days nothing is so re- 



freshing as fruit juices, lightly sweetened and 
diluted. These are quickly prepared, and such a 
variety of delicious beverages are possible with 
the many different fruits of the summer that one 
need never tire of this form of refreshment. For 
those who have not time to prepare a combination 
fresh fruit beverage, there are bottled juices of 
excellent quality on the market that may be simply 
diluted with iced water. 

Attractive service of an iced drink is as impor- 
tant as the delicate blending of the delicious juices. 
To be pleasing to the eye as well as the palate it 
should be served in sparkling glasses, thin and of 
attractive shape. Dainty, white paper napkins and 
straws tend to add to the impression of coolness. 
If a more elaborate arrangement is desired, the 
glasses may be placed on one of the nevir trays 
with embroidered napery, a dish of fruit sand- 
wiches perhaps, and a small basket of flowers. 

The fruit drinks besides being thirst quenchers 
are by nature of their acid contents invigorating 
and healthful. They arouse the appetite, stimu- 
late the various organs of digestion and elimina- 
tion, the stomach, intestines, skin, liver and kid- 
neys, and increase the phosphates in the blood. 
They are not only invigorating and health promot- 
ing for the well, but are sources of great benefit 
in some illnesses and to the convalescent. 



Iced Tea and Coffee should be made strong and 
drawn off their leaves at once to be put aside to 
cool. Dilute when ice cold with iced water. Serve 
in tall thin glasses with slices of lemon or cream. 

Iced Chocolate Make a rich chocolate, cool, 

add I teasp. vanilla. Dilute if necessary with 
ice cold water, or if ice supply is known to be 
pure, half fill thin glasses with crushed ice and 
pour chocolate over. Top each glass with whipped 
cream sprinkled with cinnamon or ground nuts. 



Cocoanut Milk — This is a favorite drink for 
children. Put I grated fresh cocoanut in I qt. 
water. Bring to boil, then simmer gently 5 min- 
utes. Strain, sweeten, chill. Add J/^ cocoanut 
juice to J/2 milk in tall glass. Top with spoonful 
whipped cream flavored with nutmeg or cinna- 
mon; or: Add 1 egg, yolk and white beaten sep- 
arately, to every pint of milk. Fill glass half full 
with this eggnog. Stir in J/3 glass of the sweetened 
cocoanut milk. Top with cream and nutmeg. 

Eggnog — Scald I cup milk with several fresh 
mint leaves, strain, cool. Beat 1 egg yolk with 1 
teasp. sugar; beat the whites stiff; whip cream 
to Yl cupful; fold the yoke, white and cream into 
the milk. 

Irish Moss Wash I oz. Irish moss thoroughly, 

and soak over night. Then lift it out and put on 
to boil in 2 qts. water. Simmer several hours.

DIURETICS— TO STIMULATE ACTION OF 
KIDNEYS 



Mineral and carbonated waters hold first rank. 

Mineral waters possess, in addition to the prop- 
erties of plain water, a mildly stimulating effect 
upon the mucous membrane of the stomach, due 
to the carbon dioxide gas and the salts they con- 
tain. 

"These waters are very useful when taken one- 
half an hour before meals to cleanse the mucous 
membrane of the stomach and prepare it for the 



reception of food. They also serve to dilute and 
wash out the waste materials from the system 
through the kidneys." 

"The alkaline waters all contain more or less 
carbon dioxide gas and their more important in- 
gredients are the alkaline carbonates." 

They are useful in neutralizing the uric acid 
in the system. 

Generally speaking, the European waters are 
richer in minerals than are the American.

OUTLINE 

I. Necessity for preserving foods. 
II. Consideration of various means of preservation. 

III. Canning of fruits and vegetables. 

IV. Drying of fruits and vegetables. 

V. Preservation of fruits and vegetables by fermenting, 
salting and vinegar pickling. 

I. NECESSITY FOR PRESERVING FOODS 

This season it is imperative, as never before, to avoid the waste of all 
kinds of food. On account of the increased production in gardens, people must 
appreciate the importance of taking care of the surplus. To save the surplus of 
perishables will provide variety for the winter diet, lessen the expenditure for 
food, and help to simplify the growing problem of transportation. 

II. CONSIDERATION OF DIFFERENT MEANS OF PRESERVATION 

The present situation demands careful consideration of the best means of preserving 
different local foods. The selection of canning and drying, or other means, depends upon 
its suitability to the product being preserved, the cost and difficulty of securing containers, 
and the ease in handing and storing the finished product. 

Canning retains the original form, color, flavor and texture of fruits and vegetables 
to a greater degree than do other means of preserving. In addition, canned foods require 
less preparation before serving. Considering the initial cost of containers, canning is more 
expensive than drying, brining or curing. The present shortage of tin and glass makes it 
more important than formerly to consider whether food shall be canned or not. 

Drying furnishes a good substitute for canning, and when properly done gives 
attractive and wholesome products. Much space in storing and expense of containers are 
saved, since a ton of many different vegetables in the fresh state w^hen properly dried will 
average only about 1 75 pounds in weight. 

Brining such vegetables as cabbage, cauliflower and cucumbers is an economical 
way of saving these products. Some vegetables can be saved in brine better than by can- 
ning them. In brining, fewer containers are required for storing large quantities of vege- 
tables, and containers such as crocks, kegs and barrels are less expensive than tin and glass. 

283 



284 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Sec. IV— Pt. 2— COOKING AND RECIPES 

Storing matured crops is of great importance. Economy demands that such vege- 
tables as legumes and root crops be allowed to mature, since in this state they are more 
nutritious and less time and money are spent in storing. 

Curing of meats is to be considered only when such products are raised on the farm. 
It is well to encourage the reviving of old methods with the use of the smokehouse, preserva- 
tion in salt, etc., for carrying over surplus meat on the farm and thus securing delicious 
products. The canning of meats should not be attempted in the household at the present 
development of canning methods. 

III. CANNING OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES 
General Suggestions on Canning — It is important during the present season to con- 
sider what vegetables to select for canning and the most economical procedure to use. The 
following suggestions should have general value: 

1 . Do not can vegetables which can be matured and form a more nutritious food 
mature than when canned green. Lima beans and others are examples of this class. 

2. Root crops like beets and carrots should be stored instead of canned. 

3. Some products like tomatoes can be concentrated in purees and pastes and thus 
take up less space. 

4. Fruit pastes, which are concentrated products made of fruit pulp, can also be 
considered. These are of thicker consistency than jams and fruit butters and may be dried 
and packed in layers, thus being economical and convenient. 

5. Fruit juices for jelly stock and other purposes can be extracted, bottled in vari- 
ous containers, sterilized and sealed. Larger quantities can thus be economically saved than 
when finished products demanding more time, fuel and sugar are made in the summei sea- 
son. If the jelly is made only as needed, fewer glasses will be required since these contain- 
ers will be used again and again. 

6. Valuable fruit syrups which can be substituted for cane and sorghum syrups can 
be made from juice of apples, scuppernong grapes and other fruits. Where fuel is plentiful for 
the boiling processes involved, these are economical because they do not require the use 
of any sugar. These syrups can also be used instead of sugar w^hen making jams and marma- 
lades of the same fruits. 

7. The city housekeeper who cans fruits and vegetables must consider a number 
of points. In the first place, she must watch the markets to find when local products are 
available at lowest prices. She must also be assured that the vegetables she secures for can- 
ning are fresh. This is most important. Not only is quality injured by staleness but the 
difficulty of sterilization is greatly increased. It would be worse than useless to attempt to 
can vegetables which are being disposed of cheaply because they are almost ready to decay. 
When fresh vegetables can be secured at reasonable prices the city housekeeper who wishes 
to preserve any quantity should further weigh the relative cost of canning and drying, con- 
sidering equipment, fuel, time, containers and the vegetables to be preserved. Fruits present | 
fewer problems. 

8. In the larger towns and cities, teachers can reach and instruct larger numbers of ' 
housekeepers by working through the many well-established existing organizations. Com- 
munity canning kitchens in the public schools may be started where conditions ■warrant it; 
but impartial advice should first be secured from the extension director of the State agricul- 
tural college, as such undertakings require trained leadership for success. 

IV. DRYING OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES 
Methods of Drying — The process of drying vegetables and fruits is a simple one and i 
can be done in the average home by the housewife. A uniformly dried product is desired i 
and can best be secured by using a drier or evaporator constructed so that heated currents of i 



CLASS 31— PRESERVING FOODS IN THE HOME 285 

air pass over the product as well as up through it, gathering the moisture and passing away. 
The movement of the current of air induces a more rapid and uniform drying. 

Vegetables and fruits can be dried in an oven, in trays or racks over the kitchen 
stove, in a specially constructed drier, and where there is electric current, by the newly de- 
vised method of exposing trays of the material to be dried to the air current from an ordinary 
electric fan. There are small driers on the market which give satisfactory results. The small 
cookstove driers of evaporators are small ovenlike structures, usually made of galvanized sheet 
iron or of wood and galavanized iron. They are of such a size that they can be placed on the 
top of an ordinary wood or coal range or a kerosene stove. These driers hold a series of 
small trays on which fruits or vegetables are placed after being prepared for drying. Port- 
able outdoor evaporators are especially convenient when it is desired to dry as much as I 
bushels of fruit or vegetables per day. They are usually constructed of wood except the parts 
in direct contact with the heater. The home made dry kiln used in some sections of the country 
can be cheaply and easily made of brick and stone. Sun drying is only satisfactory in very 
dry climates. If done, every precaution should be taken to protect the vegetables or fruits 
from dust and insects when exposed to the sun. 

If drying is done in a cookstove oven, leave the oven door ajar. Frequently note 
the temperature of oven. Trays for use in the oven can be made by using a convenient- 
sized piece of galvanized wire screen and bending up the edge one or two inches. 

It is important to know the temperature of the heat in the drier, and this cannot be 
determined very accurately except by using a thermometer. An ordinary chemical thermom- 
eter can be suspended in the drier. If a thermometer is not used, the greatest care should 
be given to the regulation of the heat. The temperature in the drier rises rather quickly, and 
the product may scorch unless close attention is given. The temperature for drying should be 
rather low to prevent scorching the product. For most vegetables, after surface moisture is 
removed, begin drying at a temperature of 110° F. Increase temperature gradually from 
1 10° to 145° F. and complete drying in two to three hours. The time required for drying 
vegetables varies. However, it can easily be determined by a little experience. 

Dried Vegetables — As great care should be given to the selection and preparation 
of vegetables for drying as for canning. To secure a fine quality of dried products, much 
depends upon having the vegetables absolutely fresh, young, tender and perfectly clean. 
Wash all vegetables and clean well. If steel knives are used in paring and cutting, have them 
clean and bright, so as not to discolor the vegetables. 

After vegetables are prepared properly they are blanched — that is, they are plunged 
into boiling water for a short time. The blanch gives a more thorough cleaning, removes 
the strong odor and flavor from certain kinds of vegetables, and makes them more flexible. 
This allows the moisture in the vegetables to evaporate more quickly and uniformly. Use 
a wire basket or cheesecloth bag for blanching. After blanching the required number of min- 
utes, drain well and remove surface moisture by placing vegetables between two towels or 
by exposing to the sun and air for a short time. 

The vegetable thus prepared is spread in a thin layer on the trays of the drier. The 
material should be stirred or turned several times during the drying in order to secure a 
uniform product. 

Dried Fruits — In very dry climates fruits are usually dried in the sun. Most fruits 
dried in the sun discolor unless especially treated. For drying fruits in small quantities for 
home use the small dryer is much more satisfactory. On very hot, dry days fruits may be 
dried in the sun until surface begins to wrinkle and then finished in the drier. Only fresh, 
ripe fruits should be used. 

Before spreading fruit on the trays of the drier, line the tray with wrapping paper 
or cheesecloth. There is a possibility of the acid of the fruits acting upon the zinc. After 
drying, cool quickly, as fruit when cooled slowly shrivels and looks unattractive. 



286 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Sec. IV— Pt. 2— COOKING AND RECIPES 

The ideal moisture content of dried fruits is about 23 per cent. The ability to judge 
accurately as to when the fruit has reached the proper condition for removal from drier can be 
gained only by experience. When sufficiently dried it should be so dry that it is impossible 
to press water out of the freshly cut ends of the pieces, and so that it will not show any of 
the natural grain of the fruit on being broken, yet not so dry that it will snap or crackle. It 
should be leathery and pliable. 

Storing Dried Product — When vegetables are first taken from the drier, if completely 
dried, they are very brittle. They are more easily handled and are in better condition for 
storing if allowed to stand one to three hours to absorb enough moisture to make them 
more pliable before putting into bags or storing otherwise. If it is not convenient to store 
products immediately and they are allowed to stand several days, just before storing they 
should be heated to 1 60° F. to destroy any insect eggs that might be on them. Care should 
be taken not to heat the vegetables higher than 1 60° F. 

Dried vegetables and fruits should always be stored in moisture-proof containers 
and in a dry place free from dust and dirt. The best container is a tin box, bucket, or can 
fitted with a perfectly tight cover. Perhaps the most convenient and cheapest container is 
the small paper bag. A small amount should be put in each bag, just enough to use for 
one or two meals. This will prevent the opening of any dried product that cannot be con- 
sumed in a short time. The upper part of the bag is twisted to form a neck. The neck is 
bent over and tied tightly with a string. The entire bag is then painted w^ith a coat of melted 
paraflSn, using a small brush or a frazzled end of a piece of rope. This makes the bag prac- 
tically moisture and insect proof. To protect further from insect ravages, pack the bags, 
after labeling, in a tin container, with a tightly fitting cover. A large number of bags may be 
stored in an ordinary lard can. A glass jar with a tight seal is a good container for dried 
products. Paraffin-coated paper containers of various sizes can be found on the market. 
If such containers are used, they should also be stored as just suggested for the paper bags. 

All dried products should be examined occasionally. Upon the first appearance of 
insects, spread thin layers in the sun until insects disappear; then heat at a temperature of 
1 60° F. and restore carefully. 

V. PRESERVATION OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES BY FERMENTING, 
SALTING, AND VINEGAR PICKLING 

General Statement — ^The preservation of food products by fermentation has been 
practiced for centuries, and in Europe many fermented substances are well-known articles 
of food. In this country, how^ever, sauerkraut and dill pickles are practically the only foods 
frequently preserved in this manner. Salted vegetables are prepared to some extent in this 
country, although the method of salting is more commonly used with meats and fish. Vin- 
egar pickling is well known in all parts of the country. A number of vegetables may be 
preserved by fermenting and salting, and when properly prepared and stored they will 
keep for a long time. These methods of preserving foods cannot replace canning or dry- 
ing, but have certain advantages, chief of which are the following: Containers may be used 
for storing the vegetables, such as wooden kegs, stone crocks or large glass bottles, which 
are not adapted to canning; no sugar or fuel is required in the fermenting or pickling of 
vegetables, w^hich is an advantage so far as cost is concerned ; and owing to the shortage 
of tin and glass containers these methods of preservation are especially well worth consid- 
ering at this time. 

FERMENTING OF FRUITS OR VEGETABLES— The method of preserving fruits 
and vegetables by fermentation is perhaps best illustrated by the method of making sauer- 
kraut in the home, which is given in the following paragraphs: 



CLASS 31— PRESERVING FOODS IN THE HOME 287 

I. In making sauerkraut for home purposes the outer green leaves of the cabbage 
should be removed, just as in preparing cabbage for boiling. In addition, all decayed or 
bruised leaves should be discarded and the core removed. Cabbage may be shredded by 
one of the hand-shredding machines sold upon the market for such purposes, or if such an 
instrument is not available the heads may be cut into thin slices with a large knife. The 
core is omitted when machine for shredding is not available, because it is difficult to shred 
it fine enough with a knife. The shredded cabbage should be packed immediately into a 
perfectly clean, water-tight receptacle, such as a cider or wine barrel, keg or tub. Four or 
five gallon earthenware crocks are recommended for family use. After opening this quan- 
tity of sauerkraut it can be used up before spoilage sets in. 

As the cabbage is packed into the barrel or crock, salt in the proportion of one 
pound of salt to 40 pounds of cabbage should be added and distributed evenly throughout 
the cabbage. Experiments have shown that approximately two and one-half pounds of salt 
to each hundred pounds of shredded cabbage gives the best flavor to the resulting kraut. 
When the barrel or crock is nearly full the cabbage should be pressed down as firmly as 
possible and covered with a clean board cover. It is advisable but not essential that a clean 
cloth be placed over the cabbage before the cover is put into place. The salt soon extracts 
a considerable amount of the cabbage juice from the cabbage and a sufficient weight of 
clean brick or stone should be added to cause the brine to rise above the wooden cover. 
Care should be taken not to use lime or sandstone for weights, for the acid produced by 
fermentation attacks the lime and destroys the keeping quality of the brine. Tubs and 
covers made of yellow or pitch pine should not be employed because such woods cause a 
disagreeable flavor. 

The barrel or crock is now set aside and fermentation is allowed to proceed undis- 
turbed. If the weather is cold or the product is stored in a cool cellar it may take three to 
five weeks for the fermentation to be completed. If placed in a warm room fermentation 
may be completed in ten days to two weeks. As soon as fermentation starts a foam ap- 
pears on the surface of the brine. This is soon followed by a film which develops into a 
heavy scum if allowed to remain. The scum should be removed by skimming as often as 
it forms, every day if necessary. This scum is really a mold growth which feeds upon the 
acid in the brine and if allowed to grow undisturbed it soon destroys both brine and 
kraut. As soon as gas bubbles cease arising, the scum should be again removed, if any has 
formed, and a layer of hot melted paraffin about one-fourth to one-half inch thick should 
be poured upon the brine. If the sauerkraut is made during the fall and stored in a cool 
place there is no absolute necessity for the layer of paraffin, for the low temperature will 
prevent decomposition. No doubt the popular idea that sauerkraut made from early cab- 
bage will not keep is based upon the fact that the fermentation of sauerkraut made from 
such cabbage occurs in warm weather, and the rapid growth of scum soon destroys both 
brine and kraut if the surface is not properly protected. 

II. Covering the Material — The surface of the fermenting material should be pro- 
tected against spoilage. This should be done by placing between the vegetables and the 
board cover mentioned above several thicknesses of clean cheesecloth, or even a layer 
about one inch thick of clean beet tops, rhubarb or grape leaves. In the case of sauerkraut 
clean cabbage leaves can be used. 

III. Protecting the Surface of Fermenting Material — If uncooked vegetables or 
fruits are fermented, there will also be more or less bubbling and foaming of the brine dur- 
ing the first stages of fermentation. After this ceases a thin film will appear, which will 
spread rapidly over the whole surface and develop quickly into a heavy folded membrane 
composed of mold growth as explained. It is very important that this scum be prevented 



288 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Sec. IV— Pt. 2— COOKING AND RECIPES 

from forming, if the product is to be kept for a considerable time. One important char- 
acteristic of this scum is that it will not grow in the absence of air. The free oxygen of the 
air is absolutely necessary for its grow^th. Consequently the exclusion of air from the surface 
of the brine will entirely prevent the scum from forming. There are three feasible methods 
of excluding the air. The first method is to use an oil, like cottonseed oil, w^hich floats on 
the surface and effectually prevents air from reaching the brine. Brine with a layer of 
liquid petroleum or cottonseed oil one-half inch thick on the surface will keep indefinitely. 
The only objection to liquid oils is the difficulty of getting at the preserved vegetables with- 
out getting them covered with oil, which it is difficult to remove. 

The second method is to cover the surface •with very hot melted paraffin. If the 
paraffin is sufficiently hot to make the brine boil when poured upon it, the paraffin will 
form a smooth even layer before hardening. After solidifying it will effect a perfectly air- 
tight seal. Paraffin has, in comparison with liquid oil, the advantage of ease in handling 
and of not coming in contact with the fermented vegetables when they are removed. Further, 
paraffin can be used over and over and thus the expense is small in the long run. If it be- 
comes dirty, it can be heated very hot and strained through cheesecloth or a thin layer of 
cotton. The one disadvantage with paraffin is that the development of gas below the layer 
w^ill break the seal. If the paraffin breaks it should be removed, remelted and replaced. 
Before adding paraffin the containers should be set where they will not be disturbed until 
ready for use. Any attempt to move them may break the seal and necessitate remelting 
and resealing. 

If cottonseed oil or paraffin is used to cover the brine it is advisable so to adjust 
the amount of brine used and weights on the cover that the brine comes up to but does not 
go over the cover. In this case only the brine exposed between the cover and sides needs to 
be oiled or paraffined, thus saving covering material. 

The third method is to pack the barrels as full as possible and replace the head. 
In using this method of fermentation with beets, cucumbers, chayotes, or string beans, fill 
the barrels as full as possible, add cover and weights. Let stand for 24 hours to allow the 
initial gas to escape and head up tight. Bore a one-inch hole in the head and fill the barrel 
full with brine. There should be no air space in the barrel. Allow the barrel to stand until 
bubbling has stopped. Add more brine if necessary and plug the vent tight. If the barrel 
does not leak, fermented products put up in this manner will keep indefinitely. 

IV. String Beans may be preserved by a slight modification of the method used 
for sauerkraut: Remove the tip ends and strings from the beans, wash, drain and weigh 
them. For each hundred pounds of beans weigh out three pounds of fine salt. For smaller 
amounts use the same proportion of salt (three per cent, by weight). Pack the beans in 
the keg or crock in layers, sprinkling each layer with the fine salt, using just enough so that 
the amount weighed out will suffice to pack the whole quantity of string beans. Cover and 
ferment as described for sauerkraut. 

V. Cucumbers, Chayotes and Beets — These vegetables are best preserved by fer- 
menting them in a weak salt solution, as the salt will not extract sufficient water from them 
to form a brine. Wash the vegetables and pack them whole in a keg or other container. 
Pour over them a weak brine, cover with a board, and weight, and set aside to ferment 
as in the case of sauerkraut. TTie brine is prepared as follows: dissolve one pound salt in| 
I quarts water, stir until the salt is dissolved and then add 1 Yi pints vinegar. 

SALTING FRUITS AND VEGETABLES 

Vegetables like dandelions, spinach, kale, beet greens and string beans may be pre- 
served by packing with a sufficiently large quantity of salt to prevent any fermentation orj 
development of bacteria. Wash, drain and weigh the vegetables Weigh out also a quantity] 



CLASS 31— PRESERVING FOODS IN THE HOME 289 

of fine salt equal to one-fourth the weight of the vegetables. Pack the vegetables in a 
clean keg, stone crock or other container in layers about one inch thick and sprinkle each 
layer heavily with salt. Cover the material with a clean cloth and a round board as de- 
scribed for sauerkraut, add a weight and set aside. When ready for cooking the salted 
vegetables should be soaked several hours in clean water and cooked in the same way as 
one would the fresh vegetables. 

PRESERVING FRUITS OR VEGETABLES IN VINEGAR 

Pickled vegetables or those preserved in vinegar are of three general types: those 
preserved whole in vinegar alone (sour pickles), those in which spices or sugar and spices 
are added to the vinegar (sweet or spiced pickles), and the chopped vegetables such as 
chow-chow, ketchups, etc., which contain vinegar. The acetic acid in the vinegar preserves 
these materials by preventing the growth of yeasts, molds or bacteria, which would cause 
the fruit to spoil.

HOME CANNING BY THE ONE-PERIOD 
COLD-PACK METHOD 

By O. H. Benson, Agriculturist, Boys' and Girls' Extension Work, 

Northern and Western States 

(Farmers' Bulletin No. 839, U. S. Department of Agriculture, Extracts) 

Without previous experience, and with no other equipment than that to 
be found in almost every home, anyone, adult or child, should be able to can food 
satisfactorily by the method described in this Bulletin. 

By this method various vegetables, soups, meats, fish and practically any 
other foods or combination of foods can be canned, as well as fruits and tomatoes, 
the products most commonly canned. 

In all home canning it should be borne in mind that when hermetically sealed con- 
tainers are difficult to obtain, food products which can not be preserved easily in other 
ways should be given preference. This would make inadvisable in most cases at times 
like the present, the canning of such products as hominy, dried beans, potatoes and similar 
foods. 

Most home-makers are familiar with some form of canning. Much of the canning 
practiced in homes, however, has been restricted to the putting up of fruits. The canning 
of vegetables and of meats has been considered until recently by all but a relatively few 
persons to be too complicated to be done satisfactorily in the home. But it is a simple 
matter to can practically any food product in the home with ordinary kitchen equipment 
and with the expenditure of comparatively little labor. This is described in the following 
paragraphs; the system was developed primarily for use in the Northern and Western 
States rather than in the South. By its use the time required for the treatment of food to 
prepare it for keeping is reduced to a minimum. 

NOTE: — The exact wording of the government bulletin has not been closely followed here, but 
has been varied, to give only the simple directions for home canning in small quantities under the simplest 
method and conditions. We recommend that the housewife write the Department of Agriculture for a 
copy of the Bulletin, if only to have it handy for reference in the event she should want to go a little 
beyond these directions in some particular. By all means have the Bulletin if any large amount of can- 
ning is to be attempted; it shows methods, better even though slightly more elaborate, and better uten- 
sils procurable at little expense, for use in the canning of larger quantities. — EDITORS. 

Preparations for Canning — Start with clean hands, clean utensils, clean, sound, fresh 
products, and pure, clean, soft water. No withered or unsound vegetables or fruits should 
be canned. If possible, those picked the day of canning should be used. Peas and corn, in 
fact, which lose their flavor rapidly, should be canned within five hours if a choice product 
is desired. 

Wash the containers before you start; if glass or crockery jars, place in cold water 
over a fire to heat; have them hot and ready for use when the products have been prepared 
for packing. 

Wash carefully all grit and dirt from the materials to be used. Grade the products 
for ripeness. Large fruits and vegetables should be pared if necessary, and small fruits, ber- 
ries and greens picked over carefully. 

Steps in Canning — After the preparatory measures, the canning method consists of 
five steps — scalding or blanching, cold-dipping, packing, processing, and sealing. In can- 
ning berries and all soft fruits the blanching is dispensed with. 

291 



292 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Sec. IV— Pt. 2— COOKING AND RECIPES 

The products to be canned are blanched or scalded usually by being placed in a 
cheesecloth bag or dipping basket into boiling water and allowed to remain there from 1 to 
1 5 minutes, depending on the kind of product. In the case of greens and green vegetables, 
however, the scalding is accomplished most satisfactorily in steam, as volatile oils and 
other substances remain in the food under this treatment. Such products may be put into a 
colander, set over a vessel of boiling water and covered as tightly as possible. Better results 
may be obtained by the use of a steam cooker. 

As soon as removed from the boiling water or steam the product should be dipped 
into cold, clean water and immediately removed and drained for a few moments. The 
temperature of the water used for cold dipping should be as low as possible. 

The product should be packed carefully into hot jars as soon as removed. In the 
case of fruits, boiling hot syrup or hot water is then added. In the case of vegetables, hot 
water usually is used and salt is added for seasoning. The scalded rubbers and tops of jars 
are put into place, the tops of cans sealed, and the containers are placed in a hot-water bath, 
pressure cooker, or other similar device for processing. 

Processing is the final application of heat to sterilize the product and is continued 
for a period determined by the character of the product and the kind of apparatus used 
(see time schedule). The containers should be placed in the processing vessel as soon as 
they are filled. 

Immediately after the termination of the processing period, while the products are 
still hot, glass and similar containers must be sealed. 

Jars should then be placed in a tray upside down to cool and closely examined for 
leaks. If leakage is found the covers should be tightened until they are completely closed. 

Tin cans may be cooled by plunging them in cold water. When the packed con- 
tainers are thus cooled, they should be stored in a cool, dry place not exposed to freezing 
temperature. Most products packed in glass jars will bleach or darken if exposed to light; 
it is well, therefore, to wrap jars in paper. From time to time, especially in very hot 
weather, both glass jars and tin cans should be examined to make certain that there are 
no leaks, swellings, or other signs of fermentation. 

Equipment Required — ^Whatever type of apparatus is used for processing or steriliz- 
ing, a number of utensils are needed for properly handling the products during the preced- 
ing steps. These include five or six acid-proof pans with covers for use in handling and 
blanching acid fruits, two tablespoons, one set of measuring spoons, one wire basket or sev- 
eral yards of cheesecloth for use in blanching, six wiping cloths, two hand towels, one dup- 
lex fork for lifting hot jars, several sharp paring knives, a generous supply of clean hot and 
cold water, a garbage pail for scraps and a good stove or other heating device. 

For processing, home canners may choose from among several types of apparatus, 
according to their needs and means and the extent of their canning intentions. There are 
five general types of outfits in common use. These are described at length in the Bulletin 
from which these paragraphs are taken, and those who plan any extended amount or quan- 
tity of canning should obtain a copy and study these several methods carefully. For home- 
canning in small amounts the following homemade outfits are fully sufficient. 

Home-made outfits are constructed of such utensils as wash-boilers, tin pails, milk 
cans, metal washtubs and lard pails Such canners should have well-fitting covers and false ■ 
bottoms or lifting platforms of metal or wood; the latter are to support jars or cans to pre-|| 
vent direct contact with heat and also permit a free circulation of water and steam around 
and under the containers. 

Difficulties in the Operation of hot-water bath canning outfits may be avoided if the 
following rules are observed. Support the jars on a perforated platform sufficiently to 
permit the circulation of water under and around the jars. Have the water cover the tops 



CLASS 31— HOME CANNING, ONE-PERIOD, COLD-PACK METHOD 293 

of the jars by at least one inch. Count time as soon as the water begins to boil vigorously. 
Remove the jars from the water and tighten the covers as soon as the time is up. 

Containers — The method here described does not require a particular class of con- 
tainer. Glass jars, crockery jars (with air-tight tops) or tin cans of practically any type may 
be used if they are carefully cleaned and properly handled and sealed. When products are 
to be used in the home, glass jars are perhaps preferable to tin cans. Jars may be sealed 
without the use of special apparatus and may be used over and over again if taken care of 
and new rubbers are used each time. Tins, on the other hand, must be thrown away each 
time. Tin cans, however, have certain advantages. They exclude light and so prevent 
bleaching; they may be packed, handled and transported more safely than glass jars. 

Altitude Changes — The directions given here for canning are based upon an altitude 
from sea level to 1 000 feet and upon the use of the quart can or container. If using smaller 
cans or jars, reduce the time a trifle; if using larger, increase the time. For altitudes above 
1 000 feet the time of sterilization should be increased at the rate of 1 per cent, for each 
500 feet. 

Seasoning — In seasoning foods it should be kept in mind that most vegetables as 
well as meats are injured in flavor and quality by an excessive use of salt for seasoning in 
the canning process. A little salt is very palatable and its use should be encouraged, but it 
is better to add no salt in canning than to use too much. Salt can be added to suit the taste 
when canned goods are served. 

Syrups — Syrups are employed usually in canning fruits. A formula much used in 
some sections for syrup is 3 quarts of sugar to 2 quarts of water, boiled to a thin, medium- 
thin, medium-thick, or thick syrup. The formula sometimes called the Eastern formula is 3 
quarts of water to 2 quarts of sugar, boiled to a thin, medium-thin, medium-thick, or thick 
syrup. The first formula may be used for canning all kinds of fruits delicate in flavor and 
texture and when sugar is low or reasonable in price. When sugar is high in price and the 
character of the fruit is such that less sugar is required, the Eastern formula may be used. 
The following may be remembered: 

Thin syrup is sugar and water boiled sufficiently to dissolve all of the sugar, but is 
not sticky. Such syrup has a density of from 12 to 20 per cent. Medium-thin syrup is that 
which has begun to thicken and becomes sticky when cooled on the finger tip or spoon; dens- 
ity 20 to 40 per cent. Medium-thick syrup is that which has thickened enough to roll or 
pile up over the edge of the spoon when it is poured out; density 40 to 50 per cent. Thick 
syrup is that which has become so thick that it is difficult to pour out of a spoon or con- 
tainer, but has not sugared; density 50 to 64 per cent. 

Thin syrups are used for all sweet fruits such as cherries, peaches, apples, etc., that 
are not too delicate in texture and color. Medium-thin syrups are used in the canning of 
the medium-sweet fruits, such as blackberries, currents, dewberries, huckleberries, raspber- 
ries, etc. Medium-thick syrups are used in the canning of all sour fruits, such as goose- 
berries, appricots, sour apples, etc., and delicately colored fruits such as strawberries and 
red raspberries. Thick syrup is used in preserving and making all kinds of sun-cooked 
preserves. 

Canning Fruit Without Sugar — All fruits can be canned for future use for jelly mak- 
ing, pie filling, salad purposes, etc., without the use of sugar by simply adding hot water 
instead of the hot syrups. It has been found practicable also with certain vegetables to sub- 
stitute sugar for salt in the canning process, and then add other seasonings to taste when 
serving. 



294 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Sec. IV— Pt. 2— COOKING AND RECIPES 

In canning fruit without sugar, can it the day it is picked ; cull, stem, seed and clean 
fruit by placing in strainer and pouring cold water over it. Pack the product carefully in 
hot glass jars or tin cans until full. Use tablespoon, wooden ladle or table knife for packing 
purposes. Pour boiling hot water over the product in the hot jar. Place rubbers and caps 
in position, not tight. If using tin cans, seal completely. Place product in the sterilizer, 
vat or canner, and sterilize for the length of time given, which for hot-water bath is 30 min- 
utes. After sterilizing remove the filled containers. Seal jars; invert to cool and test for 
leaks. Wrap in paper to prevent bleaching and store in a cool, dry place. If tin cans are 
used it will be found advantageous to plunge them into cold water immediately after steriliz- 
ing, to cool them quickly.

NOTE: Sterilization time given is for water-bath method. For other meth- 
ods, as a rule more suited for canning or preserving larger quantities than for the 
usual small amounts put up in the home, it is recommended that the housekeeper 
send to the Department of Agriculture for Farmers' Bulletin 839, Home-Canning 
by the One-Period Cold-Pack Method, and study this Bulletin thoroughly in its 
entirety. 

CANNING DIRECTIONS 



VEGETABLES 

Tomatoes Scald I Yl ininutes or until skin 

loosens. Cold dip. Remove stems and cores. 
Pack directly into cans or hot jars. Press down 
with tablespoon (add no water). Add level tea- 
spoon salt per quart. Put rubbers and caps o( jars 
into position, not tight. Seal tin cans completely. 
Sterilize (water-bath) 22 minutes. 

Sweet Peppers — Use sweet green peppers. Place 
the peppers in the oven and bake them until the 
skins separate from the meat. Remove the skins. 
Pack them solid in hot glass jars or tin cans. Add 
water. Add 1 level teaspoonful of salt per quart. 
Put the rubbers and caps of jars in position, not 
tight. Cap and tip tin cans. Sterilize (water- 
bath) 90 minutes. Remove the jars; tighten the 
covers: invert the jars to cool, and test the joints. 
Wrap the jars to prevent bleaching. 

Pumpkins, Squash, Hominy and Sauerkraut — 

Prepare and cut into convenient sections. Blanch 
3 minutes. Cold dip; pack closely in hot jars or 
cans. Fill with boiling water. Add level teaspoon- 
ful salt per quart. Put rubbers and caps of jars 
into position, not tight. Seal tin cans completely. 
Sterilize (water-bath) 120 minutes. 

Sweet Corn — Remove husk and silk. Blanch 
5 minutes on cob. Cold-dip; cut corn from cob 
and pack directly in hot jars or cans ( j/^ inch of 
top). Fill with boiling water. Add level teaspoon- 
ful salt per quart. Put rubbers and caps of jars 
into position, not tight. Seal cans completely. 
Sterilize (water-bath) 1 80 minutes. 

Corn seems to give home canners more trouble 
than do most products; but with care and study 
corn may be canned as easily as any other product 
grown in the garden. A little experience in select- 
ing the ear and the ability to recognize corn that 
is just between the milk and the dough stage are 
important. Cut the corn from the cob with a 
sharp, thin-bladed knife, and pack it at once into 
sterilized jars. Best results can be obtained when 
one person cuts the corn from the cob and one 



person fills the containers. If it is necessary for 
one person to work alone, he should cut off suffici- 
ent corn to fill one jar, pour on boiling water, add 
salt, place the rubber and the cap in position, and 
put the jar into the canner or hot water at once. 
Corn expands a little in processing, and for this 
reason jars should not be filled quite full. Corn 
that has reached the dough stage before being 
packed will have a cheesy appearance after can- 
ning. Corn should never be allowed to remain in 
the cold-dip water, and large quantities should not 
be dipped at one time unless sufficient help is avail- 
able to handle the product quickly. Water-logged 
or soaked corn indicates slow and inefficient pack- 
ing. 

When canning sweet corn on the cob, follow 
same directions but pack ^vhole ears in jars instead 
of the cut-off corn. 

Home Canning Field Corn — ^This product is 
usually known as corn club breakfast food, or 4-H 
brand food product. The corn should be selected 
between the milk and the dough stage. Wide- 
mouthed glass jars or tin cans should be used. 
Avoid packing container too full, as the product 
swells during the sterilization period. The corn 
should be canned the same day it is picked from 
the field, if possible. The yellow field-corn makes 
a yellow, butter-like food product when ground and 
canned. Avoid mixing the white and the yellow or 
Bloody Butcher corn in the same batch of food 
products. Secure a good grade of food chopper 
for grating the corn. Small 1 cent hand graters 
can be used, but work with these is too slow and 
tedious. 

Blanch the corn ears in boiling hot water or live 
steam for 1 minutes. Remove and dip quickly in 
cold water. Cut the corn from the cob with a 
sharp, thin-bladed knife. Feed the corn to the 
food chopper and grind to a pulp. Cook this 
product in a kettle, add one level teaspoonful salt 
to each quart, and a little butter, and sweeten a 
trifle with sugar. Cook (stir while cooking) until 
the product has assumed a thickened or pastelike 
mass. Then pack this product immediately in tin

296 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Sec. IV— Pt. 2— COOKING AND RECIPES 



cans or hot glass jars to one-fourth inch of the 
top. Seal jars by placing rubber and cap in posi- 
tion and seal tin cans completely. Place jars and 
cans in wash boiler or sterilizer and process (hot- 
water-bath) 1 80 minutes. 

After this product has been sterilized and cooked 
and stored away, it will form a solid, butterlike 
mass, w^hich when removed w^hole from the jars or 
pack may be cut in convenient slices for toasting, 
frying and baking purposes, and will make a de- 
licious food product, palatable, economical and 
nourishing. 

Vegetables Such as Wax Beans, Stringless Beans, 
Okra, Green Peppers, Cabbage and Bmssels 
Sprouts — String or hull. Blanch in live steam for 
5 to 1 minutes. Remove and dip quickly in cold 
water. Pack in hot jars or tin cans and add boil- 
ing hot water until jars or tin cans are full. Add 
one level teaspoonful salt to each quart. Put rub- 
bers and caps of jars in position, not tight. Seal 
tin cans completely. Sterilize (water-bath) 120 
minutes. 

Lima Beans, Peas and Other Vegetables or Com- 
binations of Them — Blanch in live steam for 5 to 
1 minutes. Dip quickly in cold water. Pack im- 
mediately in hot glass jars or tin cans. Add boiling 
hot water to fill container. Add level teaspoonful 
salt per quart. Place rubbers and caps of jars in 
position, not tight. Seal tin cans completely. Ster- 
ilize (water-bath) 180 minutes. Remove from con- 
tainer; tighten cover; invert to cool and test the 
joints. Wrap in paper to prevent breakage and 
store. 

Peas — A cloudy or hazy appearance of the 
liquid when peas are keeping w^ell indicates that 
the product was roughly handled in blanching and 
cold-dipping, or that split or broken peas were not 
removed before packing. When peas are too old 
and blanching is not done carefully, the skin be- 
comes cracked and the liquid cloudy. Some vraters 
of high mineral content have a tendency to in- 
crease cloudiness, also to harden the peas. 

Cauliflower — Use the flowered portion. Plunge 
it into cold brine (one-half pound salt to 1 2 quarts 
water). Allow the cauliflower to remain in brine 
for one hour. Blanch it three minutes and dip 
quickly into cold water. Pack it in hot glass jars 
or tin cans. Fill with boiling water and add a level 
teaspoonful salt for each quart. Put rubbers and 
caps of jars in position, not tight. Cap and tip 
tins. Sterilize (water-bath) 60 minutes. Remove 
the jars; tighten covers; invert jars to cool, and 
test the joints. Wrap the jars vrith paper to pre- 
vent bleaching. 

Mushrooms — Caution: Unless you are absolutely 
sure that you know a mushroom when you see it, 
do not run the risk of gathering and using for food 
what you think are mushrooms. A large number 
of persons are poisoned every year because of 



carelessness in this regard. Many very poisonous 
plants closely resemble edible mushrooms. Can 
mushrooms immediately after picking; if allowed 
to stand they become unfit for use. (See Farmers' 
Bulletin, 796, Some Common Edible and Poisonous 
Mushrooms.) 

Wash and trim the mushrooms. If small, can 
them whole; if large, they may be cut into sections. 
Blanch the mushrooms in boiling water 5 minutes 
Remove and plunge them quickly into very cold 
water. Pack in hot glass jars and add boiling 
water to cover; add one level teaspoonful salt to 
the quart. Place rubbers and caps of jars in posi- 
tion, not tight. Sterilize (water-bath) 90 minutes. 
Remove the jars; tighten covers; invert jars to cool 
and test the joints. Wrap jars in paper. If can- 
ning in tin, always use lacquered cans. After open- 
ing containers, remove the mushrooms immediately 
and use them as quickly as possible. 

Root and Tuber Vegetables, Such as Carrots, 
Parsnips, Salsify, Beets, Turnips and Sweet Pota- 
toes — Grade for size, color and degree of ripeness. 
Wash thoroughly, use vegetable brush. Scald or 
blanch in hot water sufficiently to loosen the skin. 
Dip quickly into cold water. Scrape or pare to 
remove skin. Pack whole vegetables, slices or 
cross-section pieces in hot glass jars or tin cans. 
Add boiling hot water until full. Add level tea- 
spoonful salt to quart. Place rubbers and tops of 
jars in position; partially seal, but not tight. Cap 
and tip tin cans completely. Sterilize (water-bath) 
90 minutes. Remove jars from canner; tighten 
covers; invert to cool, and test joints. Wrap in 
paper and store. 

How to Prevent the Fading of Beets — Small 
beets that run 40 to the quart are the most suitable 
size for first-class packs. The older the beet the 
more chance there is for loss of color. When pre- 
paring the beet, leave on one inch of the stem and 
all of the tail while blanching. Blanch not more 
than 5 minutes, and cold-dip. The skin should be 
scraped from the beet, not peeled. Beets should 
be packed whole, if possible. Well-canned beets 
will show a slight loss of color when removed from 
the canner, but will brighten up in a few days. 

Greens or Potherbs — ^A large number of culti- ' 
vated and wild greens are edible, and if canned by 
this method will make a succulent and valuable 
food for the winter and spring months. Among 
the cultivated greens are Swiss chard, kale, Chin- 
ese cabbage leaves, upland cress, French endive, 
cabbage sprouts, turnip tops, young tender New 
Zealand spinach, beet tops, dandelion, young ten- 
der dasheen sprouts, native mustard, Russian mus- 
tard, collards, and tender rape leaves. Among the 
wild greens are pepper cress, lambs quarter, sour 
dock, smartweed, sprouts, purslane, or "pusley," J 
pokeweed sprouts, dandelion, marsh marigold, 
wild mustard, and milkweed (tender sprouts and 
young leaves). 



CLASS 31— CANNING AND PRESERVING 



297 



Can the day they are picked. Wash clean, sort 
thoroughly, allowing no foreign weed leaves or 
other vegetable matter to remain. Rid the greens 
of all sand. Rid of dry or decayed or diseased 
leaves. Place the greens in a crate or cheesecloth 
and blanch in live steam either in an improvised 
home-made steamer or regular commercial steamer 
for 1 5 minutes. Reniove the greens and plunge 
quickly into cold water. Place on the table and 
cut into convenient lengths. Pack tight in hot jars 



or tin cans. Add hot water to fill the container 
and season to taste. The product will be slightly 
improved if a few strips of boiled bacon or chipped 
beef are added. A little olive oil also improves the 
flavor. If using glass jars, place rubbers and tops 
in position: partially seal. If using tin cans, cap 
and tip completely. Sterilize (water-bath) 120 
minutes. Remove from canner, tighten covers of 
jars; invert to cool, and test the joints. Wrap in 
paper to prevent bleaching, and store. 



VEGETABLE COMBINATIONS 



Com and Tomato Combination — Blanch fresh 
com on the cob 5 minutes. Cold-dip quickly. Cut 
the corn from the cob, cutting from tip to butt. 
Scald the tomatoes I Yl minutes and cold-dip. Re- 
move the skin and core. Chop tomatoes into 
medium-sized pieces. Mix thoroughly 2 parts 
tomatoes with I part corn. Pack the mixture in 
hot glass jars or enameled tin cans. Add a level 
teaspoonful salt per cjuart. Put rubbers and caps 
of jars in position, not tight. Cap and tip tin cans. 
Sterilize (water-bath) 1 20 minutes. Remove the 
jars; tighten the covers; invert the jars to cool, and 
test the joints. Wrap the jars with paper to pre- 
vent bleaching. 

Corn, Tomato and String Bean Combination — 



Use I part corn, I part green string beans, 3 parts 
tomatoes. Blanch fresh corn on the cob 5 min- 
utes and cold-dip. Cut the corn from the cob, 
cutting from tip to butt. Prepare string beans and 
cut them into convenient lengths. Blanch them 
4 minutes and cold-dip. Blanch tomatoes I to 
3 minutes and cold-dip. Remove the skin and 
core. Cut the tomatoes into medium-sized pieces. 
Mix thoroughly. Pack the mixture in hot glass 
jars or enameled tin cans. Put rubbers and caps 
of jars in position, not tight. Cap and tip tin 
cans. Sterilize for the time of 120 minutes (water- 
bath). Remove the jars; tighten the covers; in- 
vert the jars to cool, and test the joints. Wrap 
the jars with paper to prevent bleaching. 



FRUITS 



Soft Fruits and Berries — These include apricots, 
blackberries, blueberries, cherries, currants, dew- 
berries, figs, gooseberries, grapes, huckleberries, 
peaches, plums, raspberries and strawberries. 

After hulling, seeding, stemming or skinning the 
fruit, place fruit in a strainer and rinse by pouring 
cold water over it. Pack from strainer into hot 
jars or cans without crushing, using big spoon or 
ladle. Hot syrup previously prepared should be 
poured over the fruit at once. Before packing a 
second jar, place rubbers and caps in positions, not 
tight. If using tin cans, seal completely. Enam- 
eled tin cans should be used for all highly acid ber- 
ries. Sterilize (water-bath) 1 6 minutes. Remove 
from canner; tighten covers; invert to cool, and 
test joints. Wrap in paper to prevent bleaching, 
and store. 

Another Recipe for Strawberries — Canned by 
this recipe, strawberries will not rise to the top 
of the syrup. Use only fresli, ripe, firm and sound 
berries. Prepare them and add 8 ounces sugar 
and 2 tablespoonfuls water to each quart of ber- 
ries. Boil slowly for I 5 minutes in an enamel or 
acid-proof kettle. Allow the berries to cool and 
remain several hours or overnight in the covered 
kettle. Pack the cold berries in hot glass jars or 
enameled tin cans. Put the rubbers and caps of 
jars in position, not tight. Cap and tip tin cans. 



Sterilize (water-bath) 8 minutes. Remove the 
jars; tighten the covers; invert the jars to cool, 
and test the joints. Wrap the jars with paper to 
prevent bleaching. 

Hard Fruits, Apples, Peari and Quinces — Re- 
move akin and core. Cut inte convenient sections 
or slices and drop into slightly salted cold water to 
keep from tarnishing. Blanch 1 Yx minutes. Cold- 
dip. Pack closely into hot jars or tin cans. Fill 
with hot syrup. Put rubbers and caps of jars in 
position, not tight. Seal tin cans completely. 
Sterilize (water-bath) 20 minutes. Remove from 
canner; tighten covers; invert to cool and test 
joints. Wrap in paper to prevent bleaching, and 
store. 

Windfall Apples — Separate apples into two 
grades; whole and reasonably sound and firm, first 
grade; all other apples (bruised, worm-eaten, and 
those containing decayed spots), second grade. 

Whole Apples, First Grade — Pare and core. 
Drop whole apples in cold, slightly salted water, to 
keep from tarnishing. Pack whole apples in gallon 
tin cans or 2-quart hot glass jars. Add thin hot 
syrup until full. Place rubbers and tops of jars in 
position, not tight. Seal tin cans completely. Ster- 
ilize (water-bath) 1 6 minutes. Remove from can- 
ner; tighten covers; invert to cool, test the joints. 
Wrap in paper to prevent bleaching, and store. 



298 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Sec. IV— Pt. 2— COOKING AND RECIPES 



Apple-Pie Filling — The only difference between 
the canning of apples for pie filling and canning 
them whole as by the directions above is that the 
apples should be sliced immediately after paring 
into cold, slightly salted vfater. It will be 
found desirable to can first-grade apples either 



whole or quartered, and second-grade apples and 
products prepared from poor stock sliced for use 
in pie filling. Second-grade apples and products 
prepared from poor stock should not be sold, of 
course, without labels which make the grade plain. 



FRUIT 

The fruit juice may be pressed out of fruit by 
means of a cider press, special fruit press, or other 
improvised press; then heated in an acid-proof 
kettle up to II 0° F. The fruit juice may then be 
poured into ordinary hot jars, hot bottles, or tin 
cans, and handled by the same directions as those 
for canning of fruit itself. If poured into miscel- 
laneous bottles it is suggested that the fruit juice 
be sterilized as follows: Make a cotton stopper 
and press into the neck of the bottle and leave 

SYRUP MADE FROM WINDFALL 

Add 5 ounces powdered calcium carbonate to 7 
gallons apple cider. Powdered calcium carbonate 
(carbonate of lime) or, to give it its common name, 
precipitated chalk, is lovir-priced and harmless. 
Boil the mixture in a kettle or vat vigorously for 
5 minutes. Pour the liquid into vessels, preferably 
glass jars or pitchers; allow to stand six or eight 
hours, or until perfectly clear. Pour the clear liquid 
into a preserving kettle. Do not allow^ sediment 
at bottom to enter. Add to the clear liquid one 
level teaspoonful of lime carbonate and stir thor- 
oughly. The process is completed by boiling down 
rapidly to a clear liquid. Use density gauge or 
candy thermometer, and bring the temperature 
up to 220° F. If a thermometer is not available, 
boil until bulk is reduced to one-seventh of the 
original volume. To determine whether the syrup 
is cooked enough test as for candy — by pouring 
a little into cold water. If boiled enough it should 
have the consistency of maple syrup. It should 
not be cooked long enough to harden like candy 
when tested. 



JUICES 

during the sterilization period. Set bottles in boil- 
ing hot water up to the neck of the bottle, sterilize 
the fruit juice for 40 minutes at a temperature of 
1 65° F. Remove the product, press cork in top 
over cotton stopper immediately. If the cork fits 
well, no paraffin need be used. If a poor cork, 
it may be necessary to dip the cork in a melted 
solution of wax or paraffin. Fruit juices and apple 
cider when handled in this way will not "flatten 
in taste" and will keep well for future use. 

APPLES AND APPLE CIDER 

When the test shows that the syrup has been 
cooked enough, pour it into fruit jars, pitchers, 
etc., and allow it to cool slowly. Slow cooling is 
important, as otherwise the suspended matter will 
not settle properly and the syrup will be cloudy. 

A good way to insure slow cooling is to stand 
the vessels, full of syrup, in a bucket or a vrash- 
boiler or to place them in a fireless cooker. The 
v^rhite sediment which settles out during cooking 
is called "malate of lime," and is a harmless com- 
pound of lime with the natural acid of the apple. 
When the syrup is cooled, it should be stored in 
fruit jars, bottles, or jugs and crocks. Place the 
rubber and cap or cotton stopper or cork in posi- 
tion and tighten. Place the container in boiling 
hot water and sterilize (water-bath) 1 5 minutes. 
Remove jars and tighten covers; invert to cool and 
test the joints. Store for future use. This recipe 
is for making syrup primarily for home consump- 
tion. If the product is to be sold legal require- 
ments as to labeling should be ascertained and 
complied with. 



PRESERVES 

The one-period, cold-pack method of canning will be found especially help- 
ful in eliminating the necessity of using paraffin or other wax tops for jellies, jams 
and preserves. Three recipes and directions for canning jellies, jams and preserves 
by this method follow to illustrate the application of the method. The use of con- 
tainers with screw^ tops is recommended for these products. This will make un- 
necessary the expense and trouble of using paraffin, and will make the melting, 
molding and deterioration of the top parts of the packs less likely. 

Strawberry Make a syrup of I quart of water 

and 1 1 pounds of sugar and cook it in an open 
kettle until the usual temperature for making can- 
dies, jellies, etc., is reached. If a candy ther- 
mometer is used cook the preserves until they 
reach a temperature of 265° F. A candy ther- 
mometer registers 265° F. when placed in the 
syrup. Add 8 pounds of berries to the syrup. 



Cook very slowly, just at the boiling point. Stop 
the cooking when the thermometer registers 2 ! 9° 
F. and pour into shallow pans to cool. Hasten the 
cooling by pouring syrup over the berries. Skim 
while cooking. Fill into hot jars. Put the rubber 
and cap into position, not tight. Cap and tip if 
using enameled tin cans. Sterilize (water-bath) 
20 minutes. Remove the jars; tighten covers;

invert the jars to cool, and test for leaks. Wrap 
the jars in paper to prevent bleaching. 

Cherry — Place I gallon of cold water in a kettle 
and add I pounds of pitted cherries. After bring- 
ing to boiling point continue to boil slowly for 18 
minutes. Add 12 pounds of granulated sugar and 
cook until after the mixture has been boiled vio- 
lently for a few minutes. If a candy thermometer 
is used cook the mixture until a temperature of 
219° F. is reached. Pack into hot glass jars. Put 
the rubber and cap in position, not tight. Cap 
and tip if using enameled tin cans. Sterilize 
(water-bath) 20 minutes. 



SUN PRESERVES 

Strawberry Select ripe, firm berries. Pick and 

preserve the same day. Hull and rinse as in No. I 
under Strawberry Canning. Place them in a shal- 
low platter in a single layer; sprinkle sugar over 
them; pour over them fifty degree syrup (same as 
strawberry preserves, but boiled thicker). Cover 
them with a glass dish or a plain window glass. 
Allow them to stand in the hot sun 8 to I 2 hours. 
Pack them in hot screw-top jelly glasses. Put the 
rubber and cap in position, not tight. Cap and 
tip if using enameled tin cans. Sterilize (water- 
bath) 20 minutes. Remove the jars; tighten cov- 
ers; invert the jars to cool, and test the joint. 
Wrap the jars in paper to prevent bleaching.

CLASS 31— CANNING AND PRESERVING 301 

PRESERVING MEATS 

(U. S. Department of Agriculture) 

While meats may be canned successfully if directions are followed care- 
fully, it is perhaps advisable for beginners in canning to start with vegetables and 
fruits, taking up the canning of meats only after thorough familiarity with the pro- 
cess described in this bulletin has been acquired. If canned meat products are to 
be offered for sale through interstate shipment, inquiry should be made of the 
U. S. Department of Agriculture and State food regulating agencies in regard to 
the steps which must be taken to comply with the United States meat-inspection 
regulations and local laws. 

Poultry and Game Birds — Recipe No. 1 — Kill fowl and draw at once; wash carefully 
and cool; cut into convenient sections. Place in wire basket or cheesecloth and boil until 
meat can be removed from bones; remove from boiling liquid and remove meat from 
bones; pack closely into glass jars or enameled cans; fill jars with pot liquid, after it has 
been concentrated one-half; add level teaspoonful salt per quart of meat, for seasoning; 
put rubbers and caps of jars in position, not tight. Cap and tip tin cans. Sterilize (water- 
bath) 3 hours. Remove jars; tighten covers; invert to cool and test joints. Wrap jars with 
paper. 

Recipe No. 2 — Kill fowl and draw at once; wash carefully and cool; cut into con- 
venient sections; scald in boiling water and dip at once into cold water. Pack immediately 
into glass jars or enameled cans; fill with boiling water; add level teaspoonful salt per quart; 
put rubbers and caps of jars in position, not tight. Cap and tip tin cans. Sterilize (water 
bath) 3 hours. Remove jars; tighten covers; invert to cool, and test joints. Wrap jars with 
paper to prevent bleaching. 

Fresh Beef — Obtain fresh beef, cut into convenient pieces for handling (about % lb. 
in weight), and roast or boil slowly for one-half hour. Cut into small pieces, remove 
gristle, bone, and excessive fat, and pack directly into hot glass jars; fill with gravy from the 
roasting pan or pot liquid to one-half its volume; put rubber and cap in position, not tight. 
Sterilize (water-bath) 3 hours. 

Corned Beef — After beef has been properly corned for required time, remove the 
meat from the brine; soak for two hours in clear water, changing the water once; place in 
a wire basket and boil slowly for one-half hour; remove from the boiling water, plunge 
into cold water, and remove gristle, bone and excessive fat. Cut meat into small pieces and 
pack closely into hot glass jars or enameled cans. Put rubbers and caps of jars in position, 
not tight. Cap and tip tin cans. Sterilize (water-bath) 3 hours. 

SPECIALLY PREPARED MEATS 

Spring Chicken, Fried — After cleaning and preparing spring frys, season and fry as 
though preparing for serving directly on the table. Cook until the meat is about 54 done. 
If a whole spring chicken, break the neck and both legs and fold around body of chicken. 
Roll up tight, tie a string around the chicken, and drop this hot, partially fried product into 
hot quart glass jar or enameled tin can. A quart jar will hold two to four small chickens. 
Pour liquid from the griddle or frying pan into the container over the chicken. Place rubbers 
and caps of jars in position, not tight. Cap and tip tin cans. Sterilize (water-bath) 90 
minutes. 

In a similar way any fowl or wild game may be prepared by frying, oven-baking, 
roasting or stewing. The meat products which may be canned in this way include beef, 
pork, Hamburg steak, sausage, venison, rabbit, squirrel, raccoon, opossum, lamb and all 
types of sea-food. All may be packed after cooking three-fourths done in any desired way. 



302 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Sec. IV— Pt. 2— COOKING AND RECIPES 

Hot glass jars or enameled tin cans may be used. When the products are packed while 
hot in the containers the hot liquids, gravies, dressings, etc., or hot water, should be poured 
over them. Put rubbers and caps of jars in position, not tight. Cap and tip tin cans. 
Sterilize (water-bath) 90 minutes. Tighten jars and invert to test joints. 

CAMP RATIONS 

Ration No. 1 — Products required for mixture: 4 lbs. rice; 1 lb. fresh green peppers; 
4 chili peppers; 4 cloves or 2 garlic; 4 quarts tomatoes; 1 lb. cheese (or J/2 lb. butter); 1 
lb. fresh pork; 4 Spanish peppers; 8 level teaspoonfuls salt; 4 quarts water. 

Put the meat, peppers and garlic through a food chopper. Mix with tomatoes, 
water and salt. Cook on slow fire, simmering for 45 minutes. Soak rice in salted water for 
20 minutes. Rinse ■with cold water at once. Mix this product with the sauce without strain- 
ing. Grind or grate cheese and mix thoroughly with all the other products. 

To can this ration, the mixture should be packed in hot glass jars or tin cans while 
hot. Place rubbers and caps of jars in position, not tight. Cap and seal tin cans. Sterilize 
(water-bath) 90 minutes. Remove jars or cans; tighten glass jar covers; invert to cool 
and test joints. Wrap jars to prevent bleaching, and store. 

Ration No. 2 — Products required for mixture: 1 lb. rice or hominy, cracked; I tea- 
spoonful salt; Yl ll>- bacon or chipped beef cut into small pieces; 1 lb. mixed equal parts 
carrots, onions, beans, Irish potatoes; 2 quarts water or milk (or 1 quart water and 1 quart 
milk) ; Yz ^^- sweet green peppers cut fine; 1 pint strained tomatoes; season with celery salt 
or celery seed. 

Cook rice or hominy, water or milk, and salt, in a double boiler until the rice or 
hominy is soft. Bacon or chipped beef, green peppers, and the strained tomatoes should be 
cooked or boiled separately. Then add to this mixture the 1 lb. mixture of vegetables and 
season with mixed spices. Cook this vegetable combination until done. Mix at once rice, 
bacon, green peppers, etc. Stir this well into the mixture. 

The product to be canned should be hot and thoroughly mixed. Pack mixture into 
hot glass jars or tin cans at once to one-eighth inch of top. Place rubbers and caps of jars in 
position, not tight. Seal tin cans completely. Sterilize (water-bath) 90 minutes. Remove 
jars; tighten covers; invert to cool, and test joints. Wrap and store. 

Ration No. 3 — One-Pound Pack. Products used: 8 oz. beef; 2 oz. potatoes; 2 oz. 
onions; I oz. carrots; 1 oz. beans; 2 oz. beef gravy. 

Parboil the beef in kettle with thin gravy for 30 minutes. Cut up potatoes, onions 
and carrots into small sections; add the beans. Place entire mixture into kettle; add the 
gravy, season to taste. Stir mixture and cook for 1 minutes. 

To can the mixture, pack it into hot glass jars or tin cans to one-eighth inch of top. 
Place rubbers and tops of jars in position, not tight. If using tin cans, seal completely. Ster- 
ilize (water-bath) 90 minutes. Remove jars or cans; tighten jar covers; invert to cool, and 
test joints. Wrap and store. 



JELLIES AND PRESERVES 

Preserving — (Farmers' Bulletin 853, on Home Canning) — A preserve is 
the product resulting when whole fruits are cooked in syrup until clear and transpar- 
ent. When properly made the fruit in the preserve keeps its form, is plump, tender, 
clear, and of good color, the surrounding syrup being also clear and of proper 
density. 

Cook Fruit as Little as Possible — (Farmers' Bulletin 853, on Home Canning) 

— Since long cooking injures the color and flavor of fruits it is desirable to cook delicate 
fruits such as berries for as short a time as possible. Cooling rapidly after cooking gives pre- 
serves a better color and flavor than can be secured when they are packed hot. Standing 
immersed in syrup after cooking also helps to plump them. If berry preserves are covered 
for a brief time before removing from fire and the vessel left covered v^rhile cooling the 
product will be more plump. For cooling, shallow enamel trays or pans are desirable. 

To sterilize jars place them in cold water, then heat to boiling point until ready to 
use. Cover fruit with melted paraffin as soon as fruit is cold. 

Fruit for Jelly Making — (Farmers' Bulletin 853, on Home Canning) — The juice 
from certain fruits, such as grape, apple, crabapple, orange, kumquat, and currant is better 
suited for making a natural fruit jelly than juices from other fruits. The juices from these 
fruits contain the properties necessary for jelly making. The best fruits for jelly making con- 
tain pectin and acid. Pectin, the fundamental jelly making substance, does not exist in some 
fruits in sufficient amount to make jelly without the addition of pectin from some other 
source. The peach, strawberry, and cherry are examples of fruits which contain acid but 
are lacking in pectin. Pear, guava, and quince contain pectin but are deficient in acid. If 
the missing property be added in each of these fruits, a jelly with the color and flavor of the 
fruit selected can be made. 

When making the various jellies use a few apples with the fruit juice as it improves 
both quality and flavor. Combinations of fruit often produces far more delicious and 
unusual results than the use of one variety alone. 

JeUy Making Substance — (Cornell Reading Course) — The jelly making substance 
in fruit is obtained by cooking the fruit with water and thus extracting its juices. The 
amount of water and the time required to extract the jelly making substance depend on 
the dryness and kind of fruit. Juicy fruits, such as currents, berries, plums, and grapes, 
require little water and are quickly softened so that their juices may be extracted by heat. 
Dry fruits, such as apples and quinces, require more water and longer cooking than do juicy 
fruits. The white inner skin of oranges, lemons, and grapefruit will, if cooked in water for 
a long time, yield the jelly making substance. 

To Strain Jelly — (Farmers' Bulletin 853 on Home Canning) — As soon as the 
fruit is tender the liquid should be squeezed through a cheesecloth and then be allowed to 
drip, without pressure, through a flannel jelly bag. 

Filling Glasses — (Fanners' Bulletin 853, on Home Canning) — After skimming 
the jelly, pour at once into hot sterilized glasses and set aside to cool. 

To Guarantee Whether Your Jelly Will Jell — By using a simple test much waste of 
sugar and spoiling of jellies can be avoided. To decide how much sugar should be used with 
different kinds of juices, put a spoonful of juice in a glass and add 1 spoonful of pure 
alcohol, shake the glass gently to mix. Pour slowly from the glass; note how the pectin or 
vegetable jelly settles. If it settles as one lump, a cup of sugar may be used for each cup of 
juice; if in several lumps use Y4 oi & cup sugar to 1 cup of juice; if not in lumps but merely 

303 



304 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Sec. IV— Pt. 2— COOKING AND RECIPES 



settled use Yl or less of a cup of sugar to 1 cup juice; if no formation under this test, it is 
unsuitable for jelly making and should be combined with apples or other fruits rich in pectin. 

Jams and Meurmalades — (Cornell Reading Course) — If in directions for making jams 
and marmalades the jelly-making property of fruits were given greater consideration than is 
commonly the case, the product w^ould be improved in both taste and wholesomeness. The 
object sought in making jams and marmalades is a rich, sweet product which will keep easily, 
which is not so firm as jelly and yet has something of the body of jelly, which is not so soft 
and tough as is the so-called preserve and yet has something of its softness and stickiness. 
In short, jams and marmalades should be skillfully produced crosses between jellies and 
preserves. 

Directions for Making Jams and Marmalades — (Cornell Reading Course) — ^Wash 
the fruit and prepare it as the kind requires. If large fruits are used, core and halve, 
quarter, slice, or chop them. If berries or grapes are used, crush them. For each quart 
of fruit use: for dry fruits, Yl to 2 cupfuls of water; for juicy fruits, J/g to I/4 cupful of 
water. Common sense must ultimately regulate the amount of water. The least amount that 
is possible for good results should be used. Simmer the fruit until it is tender and the juice 
is extracted. If seeds are to be removed, rub the cooked fruit through a colander. To 1 
quart of cooked fruit, add two-thirds to 1 quart of sugar. Acid, juicy fruits require the 
larger amount of sugar. Cook the mixture until it is thick, stirring it continuously in order 
to prevent burning, then pour it into sterilized glasses or small jars. If a jelly-like consist- 
ency is desired, cook the mixture until it jellies from the spoon. If a richer mixture is desired, 
cook it for 5 to 1 minutes longer 

RECIPES 



Sun Preserves (Cornell Reading Course) — Meth- 
od I — Fruits that lend themselves especially well to 
the following method of preserving are strawber- 
ries, cherries, white currants, and raspberries. Use 
1 pound sugar to each pound of fruit. Put a layer 
of fruit in the bottom of a preserving kettle and 
add I or 2 tablespoonfuls of water. Alternate the 
layers of sugar and fruit. Heat the mixture care- 
fully until the sugar is dissolved; avoid crushing 
the fruit if possible. Boil the mixture for from 5 
to 7 minutes, pour it in thin layers onto large 
platters, and set it in the sun for a day. It should 
thicken or jelly on the platter. After it has cooled 
and thickened, transfer it from the platter to ster- 
ilized jars, and seal or cover them with paraffin. 

Method 2 — Fruits that lend themselves espe- 
cially well to the following method of preserving 
are peaches, apricots, raspberries and plums. Care- 
fully wipe or pick over the fruit to be preserved. 
Cut peaches, plums, or apricots in halves, and re- 
move the pits. Spread the fruit on racks or boards 
and set it in the sun to dry for I or 2 days. The 
fruit should not be left out overnight to gacher 
moisture. Weigh the fruit and use a pound of 
either brown or white sugar to each pound of fruit. 
Pack alternate layers of fruit and sugar in jars, 
being careful to have the top layer of sugar. The 
sugar will dissolve gradually and form a thick, rich 
syrup around the fruit. The mixture should be 
kept covered, but need not be sealed. 

Fig Preserves (Farmers' Bulletin 853, on HOME 
CANNING) Six quarts figs, 2 quarts sugar, 2 



quarts water. Put the figs into a boiling soda solu- 
tion (I cup soda to 6 quarts of boiling w^ater), and 
allow figs to remain about 5 minutes. Rinse the 
figs well by putting them through two cold baths. 
Drain the fruit thoroughly and add gradually to the 
skimmed syrup, which has been made by boiling 
the sugar and water together for I minutes. Cook 
rapidly until the figs are clear and tender (about 
2 hours). Carefully lift the fruit out and place in 
shallow pans. Cover the figs with the syrup and 
allovir to stand overnight. Pack the cold figs in 
sterilized jars, fill each jar to overflowing vdth the 
syrup. Cap, clamp, and process. 

Strawberry Preserves (Farmers' Bulletin 853, on 
HOME CANNING) — Two pounds berries, V/z 
pounds sugar, 1 cup berry juice. Pick over the 
fruit and put together all firm, perfect berries. 
Slightly heat, crush, and strain the others to obtain 
the juice. Make a syrup of the sugar and juice, 
bring to the boiling point, remove from the fire, and 
cool before adding the berries. Add the berries a 
few at a tiijie. Place again over the fire and heat 
slowly to boiling. Cook rapidly to I 06° C. or 223° 
F. If a thermometer is not at hand, cook until 
berries are bright and transparent. Cool and pack 
cold in sterilized jars. Process at simmering (87^ C. 
or IBS'-" F. ) to give best results in color and flavor. 
For 12-ounce or pint jars at this temperature, pro- 
cess for Yz hour. Other berries may be preserved 
in the same way. 

Watermelon Preserves (Farmers* Bulletin 853, 
on HOME CANNING) — Cut I pound watermelon 



CLASS 31— CANNING AND PRESERVING

rind into inch squares. Allow to stand overnight 
in clear water. Drain and cover with about 30*^ 
syrup (2 cupfuls sugar to I quart water). Boil 
for 25 minutes. Let stand overnight immersed in 
syrup. Next morning add juice of Yl lemon and 
3 slices of lemon additional for each pound. Cook 
until transparent (about I hour). Let stand until 
cold. Pack, add the syrup, garnishing with slices 
of lemon, cap, and process. 

Cherry Preserves (Farmers' Bulletin 853, on 
HOME CANNING) — Four pounds of cherries, 3 
pounds sugar, I cupful cherry juice. Make a syrup 
of the sugar and fruit juice, cool, add seeded cher- 
ries, and cook rapidly until fruit is clear and syrup 
is of the proper consistency. If a thermonieter is 
used, finish cherry preserves at 106° to 108'-' C. or 
223° F. to 226° F. Cool, pack into jars, and pro- 
cess as for other preserves. 

Apple Jelly (Farmers' Bulletin 853, on HOME 
CANNING) — One pound fruit, 2 pounds water, boil 
together for J/2 to 5<4 hour and strain. 

One pint strained juice — determine amount of 
sugar to be added by the use of the alcohol test 

previously given bring the juice to a boil, add the 

sugar and cook as rapidly as possible until the jelly 
point is reached. Remove from the fire, skim, pour 
into hot sterilized glasses, and when cold cover 
with melted paraffin. 

Apple and Grape Jelly — Wash, core and slice 
apples with the peel left on. Take equal parts of 
apples and grapes and half as much water as fruit. 
Cook until soft, strain in jelly bag and measure 
the juice. To each cupful of juice add I cupful 
sugar. Cook the juice 20 minutes uncovered, then 
add the sugar. Cook until it jellies. 

Grape Jelly (Farmers' Bulletin 853, on HOME 
CANNING) — Four pounds grapes, 1 pound water; 
crush and boil together for 20 minutes, press 
through a jelly bag, and allow to drain through 
a flannel bag. 

Test the strained juice with alcohol to deter- 
mine the proportion of sugar to use. Bring the 
grape juice to boiling, add sugar, and stir until 
the sugar is dissolved. Continue the boiling until 
the jelly point is reached. Remove from the fire 
and skim. Pour into hot sterilized glasses, cool, 
and store. 

Currant Jelly — Cook currants with a little water, 
strain; add 1 pound sugar to each pint of juice; 
after it begins to boil skim well. Boil 3 minutes. 

Raspberries, plums and all other juicy fruits are 
cooked in this way. 

Dry Fruits, such as apples and quinces, are also 
cooked this way, but require more water and 
longer cooking. (See general directions.) 

Mint Jelly (Cornell Reading Course) — The best 
mint jelly is made with the juice of slightly unripe 
apples as a basis. Wash fresh mint leaves thor- 
oughly. To I cupful of mint leaves (packed solid) 



add I cupful of boiling water, set the mixture on 
the back of the stove, and steep it for an hour. 
Lay a piece of cheesecloth over a bowl, pour the 
steeped mint leaves into it, twist the ends of the 
cheesecloth, and press out all moisture. To I cup- 
ful of apple juice add I to 2 tablespoonfuls of mint 
juice. If the mint flavor is not sufficiently pro- 
nounced add a drop or two of mint extract. Use 
^ cupful of sugar to each cupful of juice, and 
boil the mixture rapidly until the jelly test can be 
obtained. Just before it is poured into the scalded 
glasses, color it green with vegetable coloring 
matter. 

Blackberry Jelly (Farmers' Bulletin 853, on 
HOME CANNING)— Four pounds blackberries, I 
pound water. 

Select 3 pounds of ripe fruit and I pound of 
underripe fruit, wash by running water over them, 
cap, crush, and add 1 pint of water and boil 1 5 
minutes. Press the pulp and strain the juice 
through a flannel bag. Determine the correct 
amount of sugar to be added by the use of the 
alcohol test. Bring the juice to a boil, add sugar 
and stir until the sugar is dissolved. Continue the 
boiling until the jelly point is reached. Remove 
from the fire and skim. Pour into hot sterilized 
glasses, seal, and store. 

Raspberry Jam — Crush the berries; for each 
quart of fruit use Yi, \.o Y^ cupful water. Simmer 
until the juice is extracted: then add two-thirds to 

1 quart of sugar to I quart of fruit. Cook until 
thick, stirring continually to prevent burning. 
Pour into sterilized glasses or jars. (See general 
directions.) 

All sweet, juicy berries are cooked in this man- 
ner. 

Blackberries and other berries not very sweet, 
add more sugar to taste. 

Peach Jam — Take ripe freestone peaches and 
slice them. For each quart of fruit use J/g to J/^ 
cupful ■water; use as little water as possible. Sim- 
mer until tender and juice is extracted. To I quart 
of cooked fruit add two-thirds to I quart sugar, 
more if peaches are sour. Cook mixture until thick, 
stirring continually to prevent burning. Put into 
sterilized glasses or jars. (See general directions.) 

The pits and peels of the peaches may be cooked 
with the fruit until ready for the sugar, then strain 
and add sugar. They add to the jam and give a 
delicious flavor. 

Peach Butter — The poorer grade of peaches may 
be used, as they are to be crushed. Cook cif^r 
and sugar together until thick; allow I pint of the 
boiled cider to 3 quarts of peach pulp and cook 
together very slowly until thick. A little mixed 
ground spice may be added if desired. 

Peach Pickle — Use 8 pounds peaches and stick 

2 or 3 cloves in each peach. Add a few sticks of 
cinnamon and cook until tender, then put them on 
platter to cool and place in jars. Pour the cold 



306 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Sec. IV— Pt. 2— COOKING AND RECIPES 



syrup over. Let stand 24 hours, then seal up. 

This rule applies for all kinds of fruit pickles, 
using more or less sugar, according to the fruit 
used. 

Cranberry Conserve — Chop 5 pounds cranber- 
ries, together vrith 2 pounds raisins. Boil the 
rind of 5 oranges until tender, chop fine and mix 
with the cranberry mixture; add 10 cupfuls sugar, 
the pulp and strained juice of the oranges. Cook 
slowly until about as thick as marmalade. 

Orange Marmalade (Cornell Reading Course) — 
Twelve thin-skinned oranges, 3 lemons. 

Wash and slice the fruit as thin as paper or 
grind it fine. For every quart of fruit add I Yl 
quarts of water and let the mixture stand over- 
night. In the morning cook it slowly until tender, 
about 2 to 2 J/2 hours. Measure the cooked fruit, 
and add an equal amount of sugar. Cook the 
mixture until it jellies from a spoon, about 30 to 
60 minutes. 



Grapefruit Marmalade (Cornell Reading Course) 

— Wash grapefruit thoroughly, remove the seeds, 
and run it through a chopper. Barely cover it with 
water, and let it stand overnight. In the morning 
boil it for 30 minutes and let it stand overnight. 
On the third morning boil it for 30 or 40 minutes, 
or until the white part of the fruit is very tender. 
Measure the fruit, add an equal quantity of sugar, 
and boil the mixture until it jellies from the spoon, 
about 30 to 60 minutes. Pour the marmalade into 
hot sterilized glasses or small jars and cover it 
with paraffin. 

Such extended preparation previous to cooking 
the fruit with sugar is given in order to soften the 
white of the fruit and extract from it the jelly- 
making substance. 

Grape Conserve (Cornell Reading Course) — 
Mix 3 pounds seeded grapes, 3 pounds sugar 
and I pound English walnuts broken into small 
pieces. Cook them together as for jam. The 
juice of I orange and the peel of Yl orange cut 
in small pieces may be added for variation.

DRYING FRUITS AND VEGETABLES IN THE HOME 

(From Farmers' Bulletin No. 841, U. S. Department of Agriculture) 

"CONDITIONING" DRIED PRODUCTS 

RECIPES 

It will be found advisable to "condition" practically all dried vegetables and 
fruits. This is best done in a small way by placing the material in boxes and pour- 
ing it from one box into another once a day for three or four days, so as to mix it 
thoroughly and give to the whole mass an even degree of moisture. If the material 
is found to be too moist, it should be returned to the drying trays for a short drying. 



Many o( the products for which directions are 
given here may be dried either without or with 
preliminary blanching. In such cases both meth- 
ods are described. Alternate methods are desig- 
nated by letters. 

RECIPES 

Sweet Com — Only very young and tender corn 
should be used for drying, and it should be pre- 
pared at once after gathering. 

(a) Cook in boiling water 2 to 5 minutes, long 
enough to set the milk. Cut the kernels from the 
cob with a sharp knife, taking care not to cut off 
pieces of the cob. Spread thinly on trays, and 
place in position to dry. Stir occasionally until 
dry. 

(b) Boil or steam on the cob 8 to 1 minutes 
to set the milk. To improve flavor a teaspoonful 
of salt to a gallon of water may be used. Drain 
well and cut corn from cob, using a very sharp 
and flexible knife. Cut grains fine, only half-way 
down to the cob, and scrape out the remainder of 
grain, being careful not to scrape off any of the 
chaff next to the cob. Dry from 3 to 4 hours 
at I 1 0° to 115° F. When field corn is used, good, 
plump roasting-ear stage is the proper degree of 
ripeness. A pound of dried corn per dozen ears 
is an average yield. 

(c) The corn may be dried in the sun. Dry in 
oven 10 to 15 minutes and finish drying in the 
sun. Sun-drying, of course, is not satisfactory in 
moist weather. 

Pack in cartons or boxes for a few days to 
"condition." 

String or Snap Beans — All varieties of string 
beans can be dried, but only beans in ideal condi- 
tion for table use should be selected for this pur- 
pose. 

(a) Wash, remove stem, tip, and "strings." Cut 
or break the beans into pieces Yl to ' inch long, 
and place on trays and dry. They also can be run 
through the slicer and then dried quickly. 

(b) Prepare as directed above, but instead of 
cutting the beans, thread them on coarse, strong 
thread, making long "necklaces" of them, and hang 
them above the stove or out of doors until dry. 
An old-fashioned recipe calls for boiling the pods 
until nearly cooked through before drying. 



(c) Wash and string beans carefully. The very 
young and tender beans can be dried whole. Those 
that are full grown should be cut in one-fourth to 
I inch lengths ^vith vegetable slicer or a sharp 
knife. It is beter to cut beans than to snap them. 
They are then put in a bag of cheesecloth or in a 
wire basket and blanched in boiling water for 6 to 
10 minutes, depending on the maturity of the bean. 
One-half teaspoonful of soda may be added to each 
gallon of boiling water to help set the green color 
in the beans. Remove surface moisture by placing 
bet^veen t^vo towels or by exposing to the sun and 
air for a short time. Dry young string beans 2 
hours, more matured beans 3 hours. Begin drying 
at temperature of I ! 0^ F. and raise temperature 
gradually to 145° F. 

Wax beans are dried in the same manner as the 
green string beans. "Condition" as described. 

Lima Beans — Lima beans can be shelled from 
the pod and dried. If gathered before maturity 
when young and tender, wash and blanch from 5 
to 1 minutes. Length of time for blanching de- 
pends upon size and maturity of beans. Remove 
surface moisture and dry from 3 to 3!/2 hours at 
same temperature as string beans. 

Dry Shelled Beans (Important in the South) — 

Beans of different kinds, after maturing and drying 
on the vines, can be treated as follows: Shell, 
wash, spread in thin layers on the trays of the 
dryer, and heat 1 minutes, beginning at 1 60° F. 
and gradually raising the temperature to 1 80° F. 
This high temperature is for the purpose of de- 
stroying all insect eggs that may be on the beans. 
Cowpeas or any field pea can be treated in the 
same way. Cool and store carefully. It might be 
added that the heating of the bean or pea destroys 
its vitality. When so treated it cannot be used for 
seed. 

Okra — (a) Small, tender pods sometimes are 
strung on a stout thread and hung over the stove 
to dry. If dried in that manner, heat in oven be- 
fore storing on trays. 

(b) Wash, blanch 3 minutes in boiling soda 
water, and dry 2 to 3 hours at 1 1 0° to 1 40° F. 
Use Yl teaspoonful soda to a gallon of water. Dry 



309 



3 1 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Sec. IV— Pt. 2— COOKING AND RECIPES 



young and small tender pods whole. Older pods 
should be cut in '/^-inch slices. 

Peppers — (a) Peppers may be dried by splitting 
on one side, removing seed, drying in the air, and 
finishing the drying in the drier at 1 40° F. A more 
satisfactory method is to place peppers in biscuit 
pan in oven and heat until skin blisters, or to 
steam peppers until skin softens, peel, split in half, 
take out seed, and dry at II 0° to I 40° F. In dry- 
ing thick-fleshed peppers like the pimento, do not 
increase heat too quickly, but dry slowly and 
evenly. 

(b) Small varieties of red peppers may be 
spread in the sun until wilted and the drying fin- 
ished in the dryer, or they may be dried entirely 
in the sun. 

(c) Peppers often are dried whole. If they are 
large they can be strung on stout thread; if small, 
the whole plant can be hung up to dry. 

Peas (a) Shell and spread on trays and dry. 

(b) Shell full-grown peas with nonedible pod, 
blanch the peas from 3 to 5 minutes, remove sur- 
plus moisture, spread in single layer on trays, and 
dry from 3 to 3!/2 hours. Begin drying at 110° 
F., raising temperature very slowly in about 1 Yi 
hours to 145° F. Continue drying I !/2 or 2 hours 
at 145° F. 

(c) Shell full-grown peas, passing through a 
meat grinder, spread on trays, and dry. Whole 
peas take longer to dry, but when cooked 
they resemble fresh peas. The ground peas dry 
more quickly, but make a product which can be 
used successfully only in the preparation of soup 
or puree. 

(d) When drying the very young and tender 
sugar peas, use the pod also. Wash and cut in '/4- 
inch pieces. Blanch in boiling water 6 minutes. 
Remove surplus moisture and dry the same length 
of time and at the same temperature as string beans. 
It is not necessary to use soda when blanching 
peas. 

Pack away and "condition." 

GARDEN BEETS, ONIONS, LEEKS, CARROTS, 
TURNIPS, PARSNIPS, CABBAGE 

Beets (a) Select young, quickly grown, tender 

beets. Wash, peel, slice about '/g inch thick, and 
dry. 

(b) Boil the whole beets with skin until a little 
more than three-fourths done. Dip in cold water, 
peel, and slice into '/e "'^ !4-inch slices. Dry 2 J/2 
to 3 hours at 110° to 150° F. 

Turnips — ^Turnips should be treated in the same 
%vay as beets. 

Carrots — Varieties having a large, woody core 
should be avoided. 

(a) Wash, peel, slice lengthwise into pieces 
about Vs inch thick, and dry. 

(b) Clean, scrape, or pare, and slice into J/g- 
inch slices. Blanch 6 minutes, remove surface 



moisture, and dry 2!/2 to 3 hours. Begin drying 
at 110° F., and raise temperature gradually to 
150° F. 

Parsnips, kohlrabi, celeriac, and salsify are dried 
by the same methods. 

Onions — (a) Select well-matured onions and re- 
move the outside papery covering. Cut off tops and 
roots. Slice into J/g-inch pieces and dry quickly. 
Store in a light-proof container to avoid discolora- 
tion. 

(b) Wash, peel, and slice onions into J/^ to J/^- 
inch slices. To avoid any unpleasantness, peel and 
slice while holding under water Blanch in boiling 
water 5 minutes. Remove surface moisture and 
dry 2 J/2 to 3 hours, beginning at 110° F. and 
raising temperature gradually to 1 40° F. 

Leeks are handled in a similar manner, cut into 
J4-inch strips and dried. 

Cabbage — (a) Select well-developed heads of 
cabbage and remove all outside leaves. Split the 
cabbage, remove the hard, woody core, slice the 
remainder of the head with a kraut cutter or slicer, 
and dry. 

(b) Shred or cut into strips a few inches long. 
Blanch I minutes, drain, remove surface moisture, 
and dry 3 hours at 110° to 145° F. 

All these products should be "conditioned." 

Spinach and Parsley — Spinach that is in prime 
condition for greens should be prepared by care- 
fully washing and removing the leaves from the 
roots. Spread the leaves on trays to dry thor- 
oughly. Slicing will greatly facilitate drying. 

Parsley should be treated in the same way as 
spinach. 

BEET TOPS, SWISS CHARD, CELERY, AND 
RHUBARB 
Beet Tops — Tops of young beets in suitable con- 
dition for greens should be selected and washed 
carefully. Both the leafstalk and the blade should 
be cut into sections about Ya inch long, spread on 
screens, and dried. 

Swiss Chard and Celery should be prepared in 
the same way as beet tops. Celery also may be 
prepared in the same way as pumpkins and summer 
squash. 

Rhubarb Choose young and succulent growth. 

Prepare as for stewing, by skinning the leafstalks 
and cutting into pieces about J/^ inch to Yl i>ich 
in length. Do not use the blade of the leaf. 

All these products should be "conditioned." 

POTATOES 

Irish Potatoes — Select good, sound, well-ma- 
tured potatoes. 

(a) Wash and boil or steam until nearly done. 
Peel and pass through a meat grinder or 
a potato ricer. Collect the shreds in layers on a 
tray and dry until brittle. If toasted slightly in an 
oven when dry the flavor is improved somewhat. 



CLASS 31— DRYING FRUITS AND VEGETABLES IN THE HOME 



311 



(b) Boil or steam until nearly done, peel as 
above, cut into ^-incK slices, spread on trays, and 
dry until brittle. 

Peeling may be omitted, but the product will be 
very much inferior in flavor. 

Sweet Potatoes — Select sound, mature roots. 

(a) Wash, boil until nearly done, peel, and run 
through the meat chopper. Spread on trays and 
dry until brittle. 

(b) Treat as above, but slice instead of running 
through the meat chopper. 

(c) Wash, peel, slice, spread on trays, and dry. 
A somewhat brighter product will result if the 
sliced potato is dipped in salt water just before 
drying. 

MISCELLANEOUS 
Cauliflov^er — Clean, divide in small bunches, 
blanch 6 minutes, and dry 2 to 3 hours at 110° 
to 145° F. Cauliflower will turn very dark when 
drying, but will regain part of the color in soaking 
and cooking. Dried cauliflower is especially good 
in soups and omelets. 

Brussels Sprouts may be handled in a similar 
way, but add a pinch of soda to the blanching 
water. 

Pumpkins and Squash— (a) Select sound, well- 
grown specimens. Cut into strips; peel these; re- 
move all seeds and the soft part surrounding them. 
Cut strips into smaller bits not over J/^ inch thick 
and 2 inches long, and dry. 

(b) Pare and cut into about !/2-inch strips and 
blanch 3 minutes. Remove surface moisture and 
dry slowly from 3 to 4 hours, raising temperature 
from 110° to 140° F. 

Pack and "condition." 

Soup Mixtures — Each vegetable used in the soup 
mixture is prepared and dried separately. They 
are put together in proportions desired, the pre- 
ferred flavoring vegetables predominating. A com- 
bination of several vegetables makes the most de- 
sirable soup mixture. Those most often used are 
carrots, cabbage, onions, celery, potatoes, and okra. 

Herbs — Celery tops, parsley, mint, sage, and 
herbs of all kinds need not be blanched, but should 
be washed well and dried in the sun or in the 
dryer. These are good for flavoring soups, purees, 
gravies, omelets, etc. 

Apples, Pears and Quinces Early varieties and 

sweet apples are not well adapted to drying. Win- 
ter apples should be used for this purpose. 

(a) Peel, core, trim and slice '/^ inch thick. Dip 
in weak salt solution containing 8 teaspoonfuls of 
salt to I gallon of water. Spread on trays and 
dry. It is only necessary to dry apples long enough 
for them to become tough and somewhat leathery. 

(b) Pare, core, and cut into eighths, or core 
and slice in rings, using fruit or vegetable slicer. 
As apples discolor quickly, do not let them stand 
long before drying. To prevent discoloration, as 



the fruit is prepared it may be dipped for I min- 
ute in a cold salt bath, using I ounce of salt to t 
gallon of water. Remove surplus moisture and 
dry at I 1 0° to 150° F., raising temperature grad- 
ually. Dry from 4 to 6 hours, and longer if neces- 
sary. 

Pears are dried in the same way as apples. They 
may be steamed 1 minutes before drying. 

Quices are treated in the same v^ray as pears. 

Pack and "condition." 

Rsispberries (a) Sort out imperfect berries, 

spread the selected berries on trays, and dry. Do 
not dry so long that they become hard enough to 
rattle. The drying should be stopped as soon as 
the berries fail to stain the hand when pressed. 

(b) Pick leaves and stems from fruits and spread 
on trays. Handle carefully and do not bruise. 
Spread in thin layer on tray and dry slowly. Raise 
temperature gradually from 110° to 125° F. in 
about 2 hours. Do not raise temperature higher 
than 130° F. until a considerable portion of the 
moisture has evaporated, as otherwise expansion 
will occur and juice will be lost by dripping. This 
is accompanied by loss of flavor and color. Finish 
drying berries at 140° F. for 2 to 3 hours. It is 
necessary to dry berries from 4 to 5 hours. 

Blackberries, dewberries, and huckleberries can 
be dried in the same w^ay as raspberries. 

Pack and "condition." 

Peaches Peaches usually are dried unpeeled, 

but they will be better if peeled before drying. 

(a) Remove the stones, cut the fruit into halves, 
or preferably into smaller pieces, and spread on 
trays to dry. 

(b) Cut in halves, pit, lay in trays pit side up, 
and dry at same temperature and for same length 
of time as apples. 

Peaches should be packed carefully and "condi- 
tioned." 

Plums and Apricots — (a) Plums are not peeled, 
but the pits are removed, the fruit being cut into 
halves and dried in the same way as peaches. 

(b) Select medium-ripe plums, cover with boil- 
ing water, cover the vessel and let stand 20 min- 
utes. Small, thin-fleshed varieties are not suitable 
for drying. Drain, remove surface moisture, and 
dry from 4 to 6 hours, gradually raising temper- 
ature from 1 10° to 150° F. 

Apricots are handled in the same way as plums. 

Pack and "condition." 

Cherries (a) Remove stems of cherries and, 

if the fruit is large, the pits also. Spread out on 
trays to dry. Small, black cherries can be dried 
when containing the stones. 

(b) Wash, remove surface moisture, and spread 
cherries, unseeded, in thin layer on trays. If cher- 
ries are seeded there will be a loss of juice. Dry 
from 2 to 4 hours at 110° to 150° F. Raise tem- 
perature gradually. 

Pack and "condition."

PRECAUTIONS AGAINST INSECTS 
ATTACKING DRIED PRODUCTS 

From Farmer's Bulletin 841, U. S. Department of Agriculture 

Two kinds of moths stand out prominently eimong insects that attack dried 
fruits and vegetables. They are much more likely to get into the fruit during the 
process of drying than to find their way through boxes into the products stored 
inside them. This applies particularly to drying in the sun. 

A small moth called the Indian-meal moth is the most destructive insect that at- 
tacks such products. It is about three-eights of an inch long and has a cloaked appearance, 
one third gray and the rest copper brown. The fig moth is about the same size but dark 
neutral gray. A minute flattened chocolate-brown beetle usually accompanies these moths 
and does considerable damage. Both of the moths deposit their eggs on fruit when it is on 
the drying racks — generally at dusk or after dark, as they are not fond of daylight. It 
takes from three to ten days for the eggs to hatch into whitish or pinkish grublike cater- 
pillars and from five to ten weeks from the laying of the eggs till the appearance of the moths 
to lay another lot of eggs; and since a nunnber of "broods" or generations are produced 
yearly, if a few of these moth eggs are stored away on dried fruits or vegetables, hundreds 
of caterpillars are produced and many pounds of valuable material may be destroyed during 
the course of the winter if it is stored in a warm room. Warm, dark bins or dried fruit in 
sacks offer especially favorable places for their development. It is evident that the larger 
the amount of material in a package, the greater the chance of a few eggs doing a great 
deal of damage. Small cartons or containers have the advantage of confining the injury 
from these moths to small quantities of material, if the containers are closed tightly. 

In sun drying, if the drying racks are screened early in the evening and at night, the 
cheesecloth or fly-screen battened dow^n, and the dried fruits and vegetables stored in tight 
paper sacks in a cool place, no danger ordinarily need be feared from these insects. As 
an additional precaution, the dried product, before being stored, may be heated to I 40° F. 
long enough to allow the heat to penetrate throughout. TTiis will sterilize it if already in- 
fected. 

In drying by artificial heat, the process itself ordinarily will sterilize the product. 
But after drying it should be stored promptly, to prevent infestation.

THE KEEPING OF VEGETABLES, FRUITS AND MEATS 

(From Bulletin No. 375, by Mrs. Mary Hinman Abel, published by the U. S. Department 

of Agriculture) 

CARE OF FOOD IN THE HOME 

The following hints regarding the keeping of different kinds of foods may 
be found useful: 



Potatoes are kept without difficulty in a cool, 
dry and dark place. Sprouts should not be allowed 
to grow in the spring. 

Such roots as carrots, parsnips and turnips re- 
main plump and fresh if placed in earth or sand 
filled boxes on the cellar floor. 

Sweet Potatoes may be kept until January if 
cleaned, dried, and packed in chaff so that they will 
not touch each other. 

Pumpkins and Squash must be thoroughly ripe 
and mature to keep well. They should be dried 
from time to time with a cloth and kept not on the 
cellar floor but on a shelf and well separated from 
each other. 

Cabbages are to be placed in barrels, with the 
roots uppermost. 

Celery should be neither trimmed or washed, 
but packed, heads up, in long, deep boxes, which 
should then be filled with dry earth. 

Tomatoes may be kept until January, if gathered 
just before frost, wiped dry, and placed on straw- 
covered racks in the cellar. They should be firm 
and well-grown specimens, not yet beginning to 
turn. As they ripen they may be taken out for 
table use, and any soft or decaying ones must be 
removed. 

Apples, if for use during the autumn, may be 
stored in barrels without further precaution than 
to look them over now and then to remove decay- 
ing ones; but if they are to be kept till late winter 
or spring they must be of a variety known to keep 
well and they must be hand-picked and without 
blemish or bruise. They should be wiped dry and 
placed with little crowding on shelves in the cellar. 
As a further precaution they may be wrapped sep- 
arately in soft paper. 

Pears may be kept for a limited time in the 
same way, or packed in sawdust or chaff, which 
absorbs the moisture which might otherwise favor 
molding. 

Oranges and Lemons are kept in the same way. 
Wrapping in soft paper is here essential, as the un- 

MEATS 



covered skins, if bruised, offer good feeding ground 
for mold. Oranges may be kept for a long time 
in good condition if stored where it is very cold 
but where freezing is not possible. Lemons and 
limes are often kept in brine, an old-fashioned 
household method. 



Cranberries, after careful looking over to remove 
soft ones, are placed in a crock or firkin and 
covered with water. A plate or round board 
placed on top and weighted serves to keep the ber- 
ries under water. The water should be changed 
once a month. 

In winter, large pieces of fresh meat may be pur- 
chased and hung in the cellar. Thin pieces, as 
mutton chops, are sometimes dipped in mutton suet, 
which keeps the surface from drying and is easily 
scraped off before cooking. 

Smoked Ham, Tongue, Beef and Fish are best 
put in linen bags and hung in the cellar. 

Salt Pork or Corned Beef should be kept in brine 
in suitable jars, kegs or casks, and should be 
weighted so as to remain well covered. A plate or 
board weighted is a satisfactory device. 

Eggs may be packed for winter use in limewater 
or in water-glass solution. Many housekeepers 
have good success packing them in bran, in oats, 
or in dry salt, but the preference is to be given to 
10% solution of water-glass. Exclusion of the air 
with its accompanying micro-organisms and the 
prevention of drying out are what is sought in all 
cases. Packed eggs are not equal to fresh eggs 
in flavor, but when they are well packed are of 
fairly good quality and perfectly wholesome. 

Washing Eggs — The ordinary way to break an 
egg is to hit it against another egg or over the 
edge of the mixing bowl and let the contents stream 
over the side of the shell without considering 
whether the latter is clean or not. Even if there 
is no visible dirt, the shell may not be as clean as 
it seems, for it may have come from a dirty nest 
or have been untidily handled. Eggs should always 
be washed before breaking. 



When meat is received the skin side should be 
rubbed with a cloth wet in hot water and then 
carefully scraped with a knife. The thin outer 
skin of lamb should be entirely removed in order 
to avoid the disagreeable taste due to any contact 
with the hair of the animal. The cut surface 



should also be carefully scraped, and to prevent 
drying, be covered with paraffin paper or rubbed 
with salad oil, or in case the meat is to be kept for 
some time, entirely covered with melted suet. The 
meat should then be put on a plate in the ice-box.

CLASS 31— KEEPING VEGETABLES. FRUITS AND MEATS 



315 



POULTRY 



The skin of poultry is frequently very dirty when 
brought from market, and fowls should be not only 
washed, but scrubbed with a soft brush and warm 
water in which a teaspoonful of baking soda has 
been dissolved. Such treatment ^vill prevent the 
disagreeable "henny" taste often noticeable in 
cooked poultry. 

Poultry should be drawn immediately, and un- 
less it is known to have been killed very recently, 
it should be thoroughly washed on the inside and 
used soon. Poultry that is drawn directly after 
killing, on the contrary, keeps better if it is not 



washed until used. It should be hung in a cold 
place or put in the ice-box with a piece of char- 
coal inside the body. 

Cold-storage chickens should under no circum- 
stances remain in a warm room before cooking. 
Such poultry must be kept at a low temperature 
and cooked as soon as possible. All cold-storage 
food, when brought into a warm temperature, 
spoils quickly, and without doubt many cases of 
illness traced to the use of such food are really due 
to careless handling and delay in cooking.

SEASONAL MENUS 

American housekeepers are facing not only very high prices for all foods but a de- 
cided shortage of some staple articles such as white flour and potatoes. 

Very careful planning will be necessary to feed a famliy properly on an average in- 
come during this period of scarcity. Food must be chosen with a view to its value in the 
diet and needs rather than wants must be considered, A diet so limited tends to be rather 
monotonous and special care must be taken to have the cooking and serving carefully done. 

A garden is a valuable asset and provides flavor and variety in the diet at a rea- 
sonable cost. If surplus vegetables are canned for winter use the advantage will be still 
greater. 

The following menus have been planned with a view to using garden products when 
they are in season, and it is assumed that the housekeeper has access to a vegetable gar- 
den and some home grown fruit.

and THEIR CARE 




KEEP HOUSE "THE PAPER WAY" 

There is no other way in which there is more labor saving 
and economy than in the use of the many modern paper articles 
that have come into use the past few years. 

Paper Towels, bought in a roll, used once and thrown away, are cheaper 
than the laundry cost alone of linen or cotton towels, are more convenient and 
vastly more sanitary, and serve almost all purposes except for bath where a hard 
rub is desired. Have a roll in kitchen as w^ell as in bath room. Such towels can 
be used in many other ways than drying the hands, such as laying on the table 
when about to "bread" croquettes or prepare fish, to dry meat or fish for draining, 
or soaking up an article fried in fat, making a bag for lettuce, covering cold meats, 
and many other purposes. 

Paper Plates, which can be had paraffined or not, serve countless uses. 
Paper dishes are obtainable. Paper receptacles are especially desirable for an ice 
box. 

Paper Doilies and Napkins are bright and attractive and fit in better than 
linens or drawn work in many instances. They can be had in fancy sets complete 
to match. 

Paper Jelly Glasses are better in many ways than glass ones. They are 
fitted w^ith tops w^hich are sealed w^ith paraffin and are air tight; they are econom- 
ical and are not subject to breakage. They make most convenient molds for gela- 
tin as they can be had in sizes almost as tiny as thimbles, for aspics and desserts. 

Paper Filter — -For clearing soups, and various purposes, use a soft, thick 
paper, like blotting paper, which comes prepared for filter purposes. 

The Paper Dishrag of tough fabric will last two weeks and can be burned. 
The paper ice-blanket saves ice. The paper shelf-roll saves lots of mental agony. 

A large paper bag used to line the garbage pail keeps the pail clean and is 
most sanitary.

THE 

To Flush a Sink Trap — (Cornell Reading 
Course) — Apparatus: an old granite or iron pot, 
a granite funnel, a stick, and one-third cup wash- 
ing soda for each sink. 

Put the soda in the pot, add a quart of ^vater 
for each one-third cup of soda. Bring it to a boil, 
stirring to dissolve the soda but only with a stick 
that can be thrown away afterwards. 

Put the funnel in the sink plug-hole and pour 
down the quart of boiling soda water. Be careful 
not to let the soda get on hands or drain boards. 
Leave the pot, stick and funnel in the sink. 

See that no water goes down the sink for half 
an hour. 

Plug the sink and fill it with water, hot if pos- 
sible. Then remove the plug and let the rush of 
water finish cleaning out the trap. 

Rinse, dry and put away the funnel, pot and 
other implements and leave everything tidy at the 
sink. 

Every sink and trap in the house should have 
this treatment at least once a week. 



SINK 

To Clean a Sink Trap — (Cornell Reading 
Course) — Apparatus: an empty garbage pail, an 
old, small sieve, the trap brush, a monkey wrench, 
an old pot, and one-fourth cup v^ashing soda. 

Put the soda into the pot, add two quarts of 
water, and boil. 

Set the pail under the trap and unscrew the cap 
at bottom of the S-trap. 

Remove any obstruction that may be there, and 
brush out both sides of the trap pipe with the trap 
brush. 

Pour the soda solution down the sink, put on the 
screw cap; put sieve in sink, empty the contents of 
the pail through it, then empty the contents of the 
sieve into the stove. 

Plug the sink, fill it with water, and wash the 
sieve, garbage pail, and trap brush. Then let the 
water away in order to flush the trap. While it is 
running away, examine the trap to make sure that 
it is not leaking at the screw. 



THE 

To Blacklead a Kitchen Stove — (Cornell Read- 
ing Course) Apparatus: the blacklead plate, the 

turpentine bottle, a dauber, a black-lead brush, 
black lead, soap, an old flannel cloth, a pail of hot 
water, and a stove apron. 

Put on the stove apron, mix the black lead with 
enough water (warm) to make it the consistency 
of cream, then add a few drops of turpentine. 

Wet the cloth, rub it on the cake of soap, and 
wash the stove all over with it. Rinse the cloth 
and renew the soap as often as necessary. The 
object is to get rid of old blacking and grease, and 
so to make the surface easier to polish. Soda 
water is an excellent substitute for soap if the stove 
is very greasy or has been neglected. 

Let the stove dry. 

Commence at the top of the stove and with the 
dauber apply a thin layer of blacking to one sec- 
tion of the stove and polish immediately with the 
black-lead brush; then proceed to blacken and 
polish the next section. If the blacking is allowed 
to dry before the brushing the polish is harder to 
obtain; therefore, daub only as much as can be 
polished before it dries out. 

Fireplace baskets and irons do not require wash- 
ing very often. 

Note: It is now considered good practice to oil 
kitchen stoves, thus avoiding the labor and dust of 
the blackleading process. 

To Oil a Kitchen Stove — (Cornell Reading 
Course) — Apparatus and directions together: Put a 
little separator oil on a wad of cotton waste and 
rub it on all the iron parts of the stove. 



STOVE 

Rub off with fresh waste, an old cloth, or sonxe 
crumpled paper. 

Polish with a dry flannelette or woolen cloth un- 
til all oiliness is gone. 

Burn the waste, old cloth, or paper. Be Par- 
ticular about this because oily waste and oily cloths 
are a frequent cause of fire through spontaneous 
combustion. 

Wash out the polishing cloth. 

To Clean a Gas Stove Thoroughly — (Cornell 
Reading Course) — Apparatus: a stove apron, a 
couple of old newspapers, a wire sink-brush, a 
monkey-wrench, whisk, dustpan and brush, a sink 
towel, several pieces of old cloth, soap and wash- 
ing soda, and the separator-oil bottle. 

Put on the apron and spread the papers on the 
table. 

Turn off the gas at the main supply pipe Tvith 
the monkey wrench. 

Fill a large dishpan with strong, hot soapsuds, 
put into it to soak the dripping pan and rack and 
any movable nickel pieces of the stove. 

Fill the sink half full of strong, hot soda water. 
Put the drop tray in the bottom to soak, and on 
top of it put the top grates, doors and all movable 
parts of the stove. 

Brush out both ovens and all parts of the stove 
frame. 

Wet one of the old cloths in hot water, rub it on 
the soap, and wash off the stove. Dry it, if nec- 
essary, with an old cloth. Then oil the black parts 
very lightly with the separator oil and polish it off 
thoroughly with another old dry cloth. 

Let the soda water out of the sink, let in fresh 
warm water, and scrub the doors and other black 



CONVENIENCES— CLEANING AND CARE

pieces with the wire brush. Dry them off, take 
them to the table, oil and polish them, and put them 
back on the stove. 

Let the dirty water out of the sink, transfer the 
nickel pieces, dripping pan and rack to the sink, 
pour in the soapy water, scrub the pieces thor- 
oughly, dry them with the sink towel, and return 
them to place. 

Scrub, rinse, dry and return to place the drop 
tray. 



Burn the old cloths and wash the sink out care- 
fully. It is especially necessary to be careful about 
burning oily cloths that are not washed after using, 
because they have been known to take fire spon- 
taneously and are therefore dangerous when tucked 
into corners out of sight. 

Note: Be sure to have the stove all put together 
before any oiling is done.

MICE, INSECTS, VERMIN 

HOUSEHOLD INSECTS AND METHODS OF CONTROL 

(Extracts from Bulletin under above title, being Sanitation Series No. 3, Cornell Reading 
Course, New York State College of Agriculture, Ithaca, N. Y.) 



THE HOUSE FLY 

It has been conclusively shown that house flies carry the germs of cholera, 
typhoid fever, cholera infantum, and tropical dysentery, on their feet, legs and 
bodies and in their digestive tracts. There can be no doubt of the responsibility of 
the house fly for much sickness and many deaths. 



Where Flies Breed — The main breeding-places 
of house flies are in piles of stable manure, espe- 
cially horse manure, in rotting straw and manure 
lying in stables and barnyards, in the kitchen refuse 
of garbage cans and barrels, in manure piles about 
pigpens and poultry houses, in human excrement 
lying in the pits of loose or open closets, and, in 
fact, in almost any decaying vegetable matter that 
lies long enough in one place to ferment and decay. 



The fact should be emphasized that the most dan- 
gerous breeding-place for flies is in open closets; 
for in these places the germs of typhoid fever, 
dysentery, and cholera infantum are found. By all 
means the pits of closets should be tight and dark 
so that no flies will enter them; and the contents 
should be kept covered with fine ashes or dirt. In 
addition, the pits should be cleaned rather often 
and the contents carefully buried far from wells 
and springs of water. 



METHODS OF CONTROL 



Treatment of Manure Piles — Chlorid of lime, at 
the rate of f pound of lime to 8 quarts of manure, 
will kill the maggots if it is thoroughly mixed with 
the manure. Unfortunately, this treatment is ex- 
pensive; the chlorin fumes from treated manure 
irritate the eyes of livestock, and it is not certain 
whether or not the chlorid of lime destroys the 
fertilizing value of the manure. 

Kerosene oil will kill the maggots, but too much 
of it is required for its use to be economical. Lime 
has been used for this purpose, and has not proved 
an efficient destroyer of the maggots. 

It has been found by J. J. Davis that a solution 
of iron sulfate, 2 pounds in a gallon of water, or 
2Y2 pounds of dry sulfate per horse each day, will 
kill the maggots when mixed with the manure. 
Iron sulfate is so cheap that it will not cost more 
than 2 cents per day for 1 horse; and in addition 
it will completely deodorize the manure. 

The Storage and Removal of Manure — It has 
been shown that flies prefer light, open places in 
which to breed and that they rarely enter dark 
rooms to deposit their eggs. It is therefore wise to 
build a dark, well-screened room or a tight cement 
pit in which manure can be stored for a long time 
or from which, if preferred, it can be removed once 
or twice a week. In the country, where it is pre- 
ferred to remove the manure once or twice a week 
rather than to store it, it should be drawn to the 
fields and scattered thinly over the surface. If the 
manure is left in piles or in large lumps there is 



still danger of its serving as a breeding-place for 
flies. 

The Box Privy — Flies that come from the privy 
are the most dangerous. Not only do they bring 
germs to our tables, but they are likely to con- 
taminate the milk that may be used for feeding 
children. 

There is no longer any excuse for the old, open 
box privy, cleaned once a year. It is a menace to 
the whole household and to the neighborhood as 
well. The pit must be fly-proof and, in addition, 
the contents should be carefully covered each day 
with a liberal supply of fine road dust or sifted 
ashes. Finally, the pit should be emptied as often 
as possible and the contents should be buried far 
from wells and springs of drinking water. 

Fly Traps — Every one is familiar with the dif- 
ferent types of wire fly traps. Many of them are 
excellent and their use is recommended. 

Insect Powder — A powder known as pyrethrum, 
Persian insect powder, or buhach, is sold for killing 
all kinds of household insects. Buhach is a Cali- 
fornia product, and is more likely to be fresh than 
the imported Persian product. There is no more 
satisfactory way of ridding a kitchen of Tiouse flies 
than by the use of this powder. At night all the 
doors and "windows of the kitchen should be closed; 
fresh powder should be sprinkled over the stove, 
on the window ledges, tables, and in the air. In the 
morning flies will be found lying around dead or 
stupefied. They may then be swept up and burned.

Bichromate of Potash — This is a substance often 
used for killing flies. It is not a virulent poison, 
and little danger is incurred in putting it about the 
room. It should be dissolved in wrater at the rate 
of I part of potash to 2 parts of wrater, and should 
then be set about the, room in shallow dishes. If 
the room can be darkened with the exception of 
one window, and the solution placed on the ledge 
of this window in the light, quicker results will be 
obtained. 

Formaldehyde — One of the best solutions for at- 
tracting and killing flies is a dilute mixture of for- 
maldehyde (40 per cent) and water. Two table- 
spoonfuls in a pint of equal parts of milk and water, 
set about the room in plates, will attract the flies 
and kill many of them, provided there is no other 
food or water for them to feed on. A piece of 
bread placed in the middle of each plate for the flies 
to alight on will make the bait more attractive. 

Fly-Papers Tanglefoot fly-papers should be in 

use in kitchen and dining room if flies are present. 
No fly should be allowed to live in any kitchen a 
minute longer than is absolutely necessary to pro- 
vide means for its destruction. 



Screens — If we could eliminate all the breeding- 
places for flies we should be free from them. This 
IS too much to expect at present, and the screening 
of windows and doors seems necessary. 

Flies enter a house largely through the back door 
leading to the kitchen. They are attracted to this 
opening by the odor of cooking food and by the 
warm air pouring outward when the door is opened. 
This is especially noticeable toward night on a 
wire gauze door if the main door is left open. The 
wire screen is often literally black with flies, and 
whenever it is opened some of them are almost 
sure to enter. Moreover, this door is opened prob- 
ably more than any other in the house. The only 
efficient method of keeping flies out of the kitchen 
is to build a porch over the back door and screen 
the three open sides. Of course, a wire gauze 
door must be placed in one side wherever it is most 
desired. With this arrangement the flies cannot 
gather on the screen door of the kitchen, and they 
do not gather on the porch screen door in such 
vast numbers because less warm air and odor is 
present there. 



THE CLUSTER FLY 



A word should be said about the cluster, or 
bunch, or honey, fly, as it is variously called. This 
fly is slightly larger than the house fly and appears 
longer and narrower. It is familiar to most house- 
keepers because of its habit of entering houses in 
autumn and hiding away in protected nooks and 
corners in large clusters. Clusters may be seen in 
the corners of a room, beneath garments hung in 
closets, and behind curtains at darkened windows. 
The cluster fly is an annoyance because of its habit 
of specking and spoiling the wall paper. 

Normally, the cluster fly lives out of doors, fre- 
quently on the flowers and fruits of plants. In the 
autumn, however, it enters dwellings in search of 
snug retreats in which to pass the winter. It 
seems to frequent unused and darkened rooms: 



the writer has never seen it in any abundance in 
light, much-used rooms. 

Methods of Control — Screens are of no use in 
keeping this fly out of a room. It will find cracks 
and crevices beneath the clapboards and around 
the window casings, through which it may crawl 
in spite of all that can be done. The most feasible 
plan of controlling the species is that given by one 
of our correspondents, who says: "The only way 
I have found to keep them out of the room is to 
leave out screens, lower the windows from the top, 
and have the room light." As cold weather sets in 
the clusters of flies may be swept up and burned. 

Fresh pyrethrum or insect powder, dusted freely 
on the clusters of flies, will paralyze and kill them 
so that they may be swept up and burned. 



THE MOSQUITO 



The mosquito is really a kind of small fly, not 
unlike the house fly except in size and in its power 
to "bite." Mosquitoes are no more abundant to- 
day than they were 100 hundred years ago; but 
much greater interest is shown in them nowadays 
than formerly because of their relation to certain 
diseases. There are known to be over 500 differ- 
ent kinds of mosquitoes in the world; over 60 spe- 
cies occur in the United States. Not more than 
half a dozen of these are at all common about our 
houses; only 3 of them are known to carry mala- 
ria, and only 1 is concerned in disseminating yel- 
low fever. 



The Bite of a Mosquito The beak of a mos- 
quito is made of 6 bristle-like or lance-like organs 
enclosed in a sheath. The bristle-like organs are 
the puncturing parts of the beak, for the sheath 
does not enter the flesh when a mosquito bites. 

When a mosquito is puncturing the skin, an irri- 
tating poison, the chemical nature of which is not 
known, is injected into the wound. This poisonous 
substance causes an itching sensation. The imme- 
diate area turns red and becomes inflamed, and in 
the case of some persons much swelling follows. 
The itching and irritation may be relieved by the 
application of dilute solutions of ammonia, a 5 per 



330 



THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Section V— CONVENIENCES 



cent solution of carbolic acid, or a I per cent lotion 
of menthol. 

Methods of Controlling Mosquitoes — The best 
way to get rid of mosquitoes is to drain or fill up 
the ponds, pools, or other bodies of water in which 
the insects breed. Old tin cans, pails, or other use- 
less receptacles that may hold water should be 
turned bottom side up or drawn away far from 
the house. Rain barrels and tanks may be covered 
with galvanied wire netting, at least 1 4 meshes to 
the inch, so as to prevent the mosquitoes from 
laying their eggs on the water. 

In many cases ponds, pools and tanks that can- 
not be drained may be sprinkled with kerosene oil 
every two weeks during the summer. The oil 
spreads over the water in a thin film and prevents 
the wrigglers from obtaining air through their 
breathing tubes; consequently they are drowned. 
Furthermore, the oil kills the eggs and prevents 
the female mosquitoes from depositing any more. 

In case of those pools and tanks that cannot be 
drained or that it is not desirable to cover with oil, 
fishes may be introduced which will destroy the 
wrigglers. For example, goldfish, sunfish, or cer- 
tain minnows serve to keep pools free from mos- 
quitoes. 

The Use of Bed Nets — But in spite of our best 
efforts there are always a few mosquitoes in certain 
regions. One good method of escape from them 
is by the careful use of bed nets. If a net is ar- 
ranged so that it does not hang in folds and is not 
too low and close to the sleeper, little air is ex- 
cluded. In order to be serviceable, a net must be 



free from rents and large enough to reach the floor 
on all sides of the bed. A bobbinet bar, closed 
on all sides, makes an ideal net. Care should be 
taken not to allow mosquitoes to enter the net 
w^ith the sleeper, and the edge of the net must not 
catch on the bed rail or cover and remain off the 
floor during the night. If one must travel in a 
malarial region infested with mosquitoes, a light 
net should always constitute a part of the travel- 
ing outfit and have its place in the bag with other 
necessities. 

Going Indoors Early at Night — It is now known 
that night air does not carry miasma or malaria; 
but it is just as important to remain in the house 
at night as it ever was, because mosquitoes are 
particularly active after dark. Therefore, in order 
to escape the bites of Anopheles mosquitoes and 
the accompanying malaria, it is important to re- 
main indoors after dark or to have the sitting 
porches closely screened. 

Repellents for Adult Mosquitoes — Various mix- 
tures, oils, and ingredients are used for repelling 
adult mosquitoes. Oil of citronella is said to be 
an efficient protection, but its efficiency will not 
long continue at most, and it is not to be relied 
on during a night of sleep. It is mainly useful 
while one is sitting on porches or in rooms where 
mosquitoes are troublesome. 

The following mixture is recommended: cedar 
oil, I ounce; oil of citronella, 2 ounces; spirits of 
camphor, 2 ounces. A few drops of this mixture 
on a cloth hung on the bed will keep mosquitoes 
at a distance and will be effective for a long time. 



THE BEDBUG 



The body of the bedbug is flat and wide, a char- 
acter that fits it wonderfully well to the place that 
it has chosen for its home. The cracks and crevices 
of bedsteads furnish admirable protective retreats 
for an insect with a flat, thin body. Moreover, the 
bedbug has no large wings to get in its way and 
encumber its retreat. 

Dissemination of the Bedbug — It is often puz- 
zling to know how these insects become established 
in a house. One of the most prevalent ways is on 
laundry brought in by the washerwoman. The 
writer has repeatedly seen bedbugs come in on the 
weekly laundry. In several instances the insects 
were seen on the white spread of a bed where clean 
clothes had been laid by the laundress. 

If the members of a family travel considerably 
they are likely to bring the pest home in their 
trunks and handbags. Guests who have been 
traveling and stopping at various hotels often un- 
wittingly become the source of infestation by bring- 
ing the pest in their baggage. In towns and cities, 
where houses are built close together, bedbugs 
w^ill actually migrate from one house to another. 



Control of the Bedbug — In the first place, iron 
or brass bedsteads are much more desirable than 
wooden beds in a fight against this pest. The 
former offer few cracks and crevices, and these 
are easily reached. 

The old-fashioned remedies, such as kerosene 
oil, gasoline, or benzine, when forced into cracks 
and crevices with a hand syringe or a feather, are 
still among the most efficient weapons against the 
bedbug. The treatment must be thorough and 
should be made several times in succession, with 
intervals of 3 or 4 days between applications in 
order to give time for any untouched eggs to 
hatch. 

A mixture of 1 ounce corrosive sublimate, 1 pint 
alcohol, and J/^ pint spirits of turpentine, painted 
in the cracks of a bedstead with a feather, is an- 
other old-fashioned ana effective remedy. 

Boiling water, poured over the parts of a bed- 
stead after they have been placed where they may 
be liberally treated, will kill both eggs and bugs. 
Of course, boiling water should not be used on 
highly polished or on varnished furniture. 



CONVENIENCES— MICE, INSECTS, VERMIN

Sulfur has been used with success by some per- 
sons. Not less than 2 pounds of sulfur to every 
1,000 cubic feet of space should be burned, and 
the rooms should be tightly closed for several 
hours. In order to close the cracks around win- 
dows and doors, strips of newspaper may be soaked 
in water and applied rapidly over the cracks. They 
will stick tightly for many hours. The sulfur 



should be placed in a kettle set on bricks in a tub 
of water so as to avoid danger from fire. A half 
teacupful of wood alcohol poured on the sulfur and 
then lighted will serve to burn the sulfur com- 
pletely. 

It must be remembered that sulfur fumes bleach 
certain colors in wall papers and fabrics, and tar- 
nish metals of various sorts. 



COCKROACHES 



Cockroaches are exceedingly annoying because 
of their proneness to get into substances and be- 
cause of their filthy, disgusting habits. Often they 
become so numerous that they destroy considerable 
material. They are likely to attack the bindings 
of books and other leather articles. In the larder 
they will attack almost any foodstuff, polluting 
more than they actually destroy. 

Methods of Control — In fighting cockroaches, 
persistence should be the watchword. The insects 
are shy, apparently cautious regarding baits and 
poisons, and difficult to reach in any manner. 

Various kinds of traps have been devised for 
catching roaches. The box with cone-shaped 
tubes affords a sample of a modern trap. 
The box is baited at night with cheese or 
other favorite food. The roaches can enter but 
cannot escape. 

A rather unique method of killing roaches is 
described by Mr. Tepper of Australia. Plaster of 
paris, I part, is mixed in a saucer with flour, 3 or 
4 parts, and placed where the insects are abund- 
ant. Near at hand is placed a flat dish containing 
water, with bridges so arranged that the roaches 
can easily reach it. They eat of the flour and the 
plaster of paris, and either are killed or leave the 
premises. 



A powder known as insectoline, manufactured 
by the Insectoline Company, Chicago, Illinois, has 
given good results in fighting these insects. The 
writer has used it in kitchen and pantries with sat- 
isfactory results. In order to obtain the best re- 
sults with this powder, it must be applied in large 
quantities and persistently. 

Professor F. L. Washburn, after failure with sev- 
eral so-called remedies for cockroaches, tried pow- 
dered borax, and has this to say concerning its 
value as an exterminator of roaches: "We then 
turned to powdered borax, using it freely in the 
kitchen with marked success. This was sprinkled 
in cracks about the sink, along the tops of base- 
boards, near the sink, and elsewhere, wherever 
there were cracks that afforded the insects a hiding 
place. By a generous use of this substance, per- 
sisted in for two weeks, the room, in fact, we may 
say the premises, were entirely freed from this dis- 
gusting pest." 

Whatever powder or substance is used, it must 
be applied in large quantities and at short inter- 
vals for an extended period of time. Persistence 
and thoroughness are absolutely essential to the 
control of cockroaches. 

Hydrocyanic acid gas is successfully employed 
against cockroaches. 



ANTS 



Methods of Control — Perhaps the first method of 
prevention is to remove the substance attracting 
the ants. If this cannot be done, the food may be 
placed on a support, the legs of which rest in water 
covered with a film of oil. 

Another temporary expedient, and one that may 
discourage the ants enough to finally stop them 
from coming, is to soak small sponges in sweetened 
water and place them where the insects are most 
numerous. The ants will crawl into the pores of 
the sponges in great numbers and may be killed 
by dropping the sponges into boiling water. This 
process should be repeated over and over, and 
thousands of the v^rorkers may thus be destroyed. 
In instances in which this practice has been given 
a thorough and persistent trial, the ants have be- 
come so discouraged and bewildered by the sudden 
loss of so many workers that they have finally aban- 
doned the house entirely. 



A syrup made by dissolving sugar and borax 
in boiling water, placed about the infested room 
in small dishes, will attract and kill many of the 
ants. It is said also that camphor, either free or 
wrapped loosely in paper and placed around the 
foods attracting the ants, will drive them away. 

If carefully watched, the ants may often be 
traced and the crack or opening through which 
they enter may be discovered. When found, kero- 
sene oil should be squirted into it or it should be 
tightly plugged with cotton soaked in kerosene. 
This practice is often an effectual preventive. 

Ordinary ants may be prevented from reaching 
tables by setting the legs of the tables in cups con- 
taining a little water with kerosene oil on the sur- 
face. This method avails little with the Argentine 
ants, however, since they soon manage to cross 
the oil on a causeway formed from the dead bodies 
of their sacrificed comrades. Against the red ant 



332 



THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Section V— Conveniences 



and the little black ant, the film of oil is an effective 
barrier until the oil evaporates, when it must be 
renewed. 

Cyanid of potassium has been used with marked 
effect against ants in the field. It is a deadly 
poison, and should be handled with great care. 
If it is powdered fine and scattered over an ant hill 
after the latter has been broken up or stirred on 
the surface, the ants will begin immediately to re- 
move the pieces. In doing so, every ant that 
touches the cyanid will be killed. Colonies have 
been almost exterminated in this way, and when- 
ever the colonies of the red ant can be located the 
cyanid may be used to advantage. It ^vill be found 
more useful against the normally outdoor species, 
such as the pavenient ant and the carpenter ant, 
than against the red ant. 

It must be remembered that if fowls are allowed 
access to the poison and pick up the pieces they 
certainly will be poisoned. In order to obviate 
this difficulty, it is best to use the cyanid in solution 
by dissolving it in water at the rate of an ounce to 
a gallon of water. It may then be sprayed over the 
nest or poured down the openings. This method 
seems to be quite as effective as scattering the 
poison in the pulverized form; at least, experiments 
have shown that some species of ants may be near- 
ly, if not quite, exterminated in this way. Another 
very effective method of application consists in 
placing a pint or more of the solution in hollows 
dug out at the exits of the burrows of the colony. 

Ordinary cotton tape, treated with corrosive 
sublimate, acts as an effectual barrier to the red 
ant and other species. The tape is often wound 
about the legs of tables, or it may be tacked along 
the edges of shelves and in other places to protect 
food. The ants Vi^ill not cross these strips of tape. 
The prepared tape may be bought in the larger 
cities of the South, but the author has never seen 
it for sale in cities in the North. Since one often 
receives an inferior article from the store it is bet- 
ter to prepare the tape at home. 

Mr. Newell makes a solution of the corrosive 
sublimate by heating it in water in a granite-ware 
vessel and dissolving all that the water will take 
up. After this solution has cooled it is filtered. 
The solution may be filtered, in the absence of 
filter paper, through a fine quality of cotton bat- 
ting. A thick layer of the cotton should be placed 
in a funnel, and the solution should be poured in 
and allowed to filter through. The tape is then 
soaked in this filtered solution and pinned on the 
wall to dry. Neither the solution nor the tape 
should be allowed to come in contact with iron, 
tin, or steel. When the tape is well made it will 
remain effective for many months, even for a year. 

Tartar emetic, mixed with 4 or 5 times its vol- 
ume of syrup and placed about in shallow dishes, is 



an effective remedy against house ants. If some 
of this mixture, poured into individual butter plates, 
is set about in a refrigerator where ants are trouble- 
some, or in a pantry that ants frequent, the little 
pests will soon leave. In some cases it has proved 
to be one of the simplest and most effectual rem- 
edies that can be used to rid a house of these per- 
sistent pests. 

The only method of getting rid of ants perma- 
nently is by locating their nests and treating them 
in such a way that the queen will finally be de- 
stroyed. No more eggs will be laid, and the pro- 
duction of workers will cease. One of the best 
substances for treating nests, in order to kill the 
queen and exterminate the workers, is carbon bisul- 
fid. It is often difficult to locate the nest, and some- 
times when found it will be in an inaccessible situ- 
ation; for example, it may be discovered in the 
foundation walls, under the floor, or in some other 
equally secluded and protected place. One writer 
suggests that black ants may be traced to their 
nests by baiting them with broken pieces of rice, 
farina, or cream of wheat. The ants will carry 
these pieces of white food to their nests and may be 
easily traced in this manner. Perhaps the red ant 
may be follo^wed to its home by the same means. 
When the colony is located it may be treated with 
carbon bisulfid by pouring an ounce or two of the 
liquid into each of several holes made in the nest 
with a sharpened stick, after which operation the 
mouth of each hole should be quickly stopped with 
a clod of dirt. A heavy wet blanket thrown over 
the nest will aid in retaining the gas and will tend 
to make the fumigation more effective. The liquid 
evaporates quickly and the gas permeates the whole 
nest, killing the queen and the workers and exter- 
minating the colony. By attaching a torch to the 
end of a long pole and extending it out over the 
nest while the operator stands at a safe distance, 
the gas may be exploded and the fumes driven into 
all corners of the colony. If the colony is located 
in the foundation walls, the problem will be much 
more difficult and may be impossible of solution. 
The difficulty will be in reaching the nest with the 
liquid. If the nest is located under the floor, it may 
be necessary to remove a piece of the flooring in 
order to gain access to the colony. 

In the use of carbon bisulfid, it must be remem- 
bered that the gas is inflammable and explosive, 
and no form of fire or light should be brought near 
the place that is being fumigated. 

L. J. Nickels has been very successful in poison- 
ing Argentine ants with a weak solution of sodium 
arsenite. For a weak solution, he dissolved a little 
more than I ounce of the arsenite in a small quan- 
tity of hot water. When dissolved the sodium ar- 
senite was added to a sweetened solution of 20

pounds of sugar dissolved in 3 quarts of water. It 
was necessary to heat the syrup mixture so as to 
thoroughly dissolve the sugar. 

In order to make a small amount of the mixture, 
3 grams of the arsenite should be dissolved in a 
small quantity of water and added to a sweetened 
syrup of 2 pounds of sugar dissolved in ^ of a pint 
of water. Small sponges may be soaked in this 

CLOTHES 

Methods of Control — First of all, it should be 
definitely understood that odors emanating from 
small quantities of various substances, such as cam- 
phor balls, cedar, and naphthalene, have no killing 
effect either on moths or on larvae. Cedar chests 
or closets lined with cedar are of no avail if eggs 
are once deposited on clothes stored in them. Ap- 
parently, the odor of cedar has some repelling 
effect on the moths themselves. The odor of cam- 
phor balls also has a repellent effect on the moths; 
but a few moth balls placed among clothes in a 
chest do not prevent injury if eggs are deposited 
on the garments befrre the latter are put aw^ay. 
The real function and value, then, of cedar chests 
or closets lies in repelling moths and keeping them 
away from the garments. The clothing, however, 
tnust be free from, all eggs and larvae of the moths 
before being put in chests. Great care must be 
taken to shake and brush the garments and to 
have them in the sun and air until all the larvae 
and eggs have been shaken loose and destroyed. 

In the second place, it should be understood that 
garments which are often worn are not liable to 
injury. It is the clothing and the materials that are 
stored away in closets and trunks for a long time 
undisturbed, w^hich are badly injured. It is under 
such conditions that the moths have an oppor- 
tunity to deposit their eggs, that the eggs have 
a chance to lie undisturbed long enough to hatch, 
and that the larvae have occasion to eat and to 
grow to maturity. 

Sunlight and air are among our best available 
agents of protection from clothes moths. Before 
garments are put away for the summer they should 
be hung in the air and sun, and then be thoroughly 
brushed and shaken so as to dislodge the eggs and 
larvae that may be on them. In addition, they 
should be taken out occasionally, perhaps once a 
month, and brushed, shaken, and aired. The same 
treatment should be accorded w^oolen bedding and 
blankets that are to be stored. After the clothes 



poisoned solution and placed in jars so that the 
ants can easily gain access to them. It seems that 
the ants will carry this slightly poisoned syrup to 
their nests and feed it to the queen and to the 
broods of young ants, gradually killing off the 
whole colony. It would seem as though the same 
mixture could be used effectively for common ants. 

MOTHS 

are once thoroughly cleaned, sunned and aired 
they may be packed away with a supply of cam- 
phor balls distributed among them to repel the 
moths. It is advisable to spray the cracks in clos- 
ets and chests with benzine or gasoline before put- 
ting the clothes in them, in order to kill any eggs 
or larvae of the moths that may be lurking there. 

A few^ old woolen rags or pieces of old furs, 
stored in attics but never used, are prolific breed- 
ing-places for these moths and should be taken 
out and burned. 

Doctor Howard early suggested a method of 
storing wnter wraps and garments during the sum- 
mer, which is practical and efficient. He goes to 
the tailor shop and buys a few common pasteboard 
suit-boxes, and in these the garments to be stored 
are neatly folded away. Then the cracks around 
the edges of the cover are sealed by pasting strips 
of paper over them. This makes a tight box that 
excludes all moths. With care the boxes last sev- 
eral years. 

Another method of storing clothes is given by a 
resident of the city of Washington, D. C. He has 
a wooden chest for holidng his clothes. In the 
cover of the chest he has bored a large hole and 
on the underside of the cover, directly beneath the 
hole, he has tied a large sponge. In the middle of 
the summer he pours a little carbon bisulfid on the 
sponge and closes the hole w^ith a cork. 

Cold-storage plants are common now^adays in all 
cities and in many small towns. During the sum- 
mer these plants are available for the storage of 
furs, rugs, and other valuable woolen goods. 

Doctor How^ard reports some experiments w^hich 
demonstrate that a continuous temperature of 40 
degrees is sufficient to maintain the larvae of clothes 
moths in an inactive condition and thus prevent 
injury by them. In the light of these experiments, 
cold storage forms the simplest and safest method 
of protecting w^oolen goods from the ravages of 
clothes moths. 



FLEAS 



Methods of Control — It follows front what has 
been said regarding the kinds of fleas found in 
houses, and their rate of increase, that pet dogs 
and cats must be eliminated or must be kept clean 
and free from these pests. These animals may be 
kept reasonably free from fleas by frequently bath- 
ing them in a solution of creolin. A dog can be 



bathed with a 3 per cent solution, 4 teaspoonfuls 
to I quart of w^ater, or 4 tablespoonfuls to 1 gal- 
lon of water. Cats are more sensitive, and should 
be bathed with a 2 per cent solution. 

A dog or a cat should be provided with a sleep- 
ing-cloth or rug, w^hich should be beaten or shaken 
at least once a w^eek and hung in the sunlight, if 



334 



THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Section V— CONVENIENCES 



possible, for a few hours. If Infested, the kennel 
should be thoroughly washed inside and outside 
with a 5 per cent solution of creolin. 

To clear a house of fleas when it is once in- 
fested is often a strenuous task. In the first place, 
a change from carpets to rugs, if possible, is recom- 
mended. The larvae of fleas cannot develop in 
rooms in which the floors are exposed and swept 
from time to time. In severe infestations, nothing 
but the removal of all floor coverings, followed by 
a thorough washing of the floors with strong soap- 
suds, will avail. In case of old floors, the cracks 
should be filled with some good filler. 

The use of benzine or gasoline ^vill also be very 
helpful. The carpets should be sprinkled with the 
gasoline. Special attention should be paid to the 
edges of the carpets and to the cracks underneath 
the baseboards. Great care should be exercised 
regarding fire while gasoline is being applied, ow- 
ing to its inflammable character. 

CARPET 

Methods of Control — ^The carpet beetles will al- 
ways be difficult to control in houses having floors 
completely covered with carpets that are tightly 
tacked about the edges. A carpet placed perma- 
nently on the floor and allowed to remain there 
undisturbed for a year furnishes ideal conditions 
for these pests to thrive and increase. As was 
urged in the case of fleas, so again it is urged that 
a change from carpets to rugs be made if pos- 
sible. Where bare floors, partially covered with 
rugs, are maintained, the carpet beetles will not 
find hiding places suited to their development. 
Moreover, the rugs can be examined without diffi- 
culty at any time, and they are usually dusted and 
aired too often for the larvae to gain a foothold. 
The tendency among modern homes is to use rugs 
on polished floors, with a consequent diminution 
of the carpet beetles as a household pest. 

Where the insects have become well established 
in a house nothing but heroic measures and long- 
continued efforts will avail. House-cleaning should 
certainly occur twice a year instead of once, and 
should be very thoroughly done, at least so far as 
the carpets are concerned. They should be re- 
moved, thoroughly dusted and beaten, sprayed 
with gasoline, and hung in the air and sunlight 
as long as possible. 

The floors should be thoroughly washed and 
scrubbed with soap and water, especially along the 
baseboards and the cracks of the floors. It would 
be of advantage to spray the cracks beneath the 
baseboards with benzine or gasoline, to clean out 
all the dirt possible from the cracks in the floor, 
and to pour in benzine or kerosene oil. Before 
the carpet is replaced on old floors the cracks 
should be filled with a crack-filler, and thus the 
favorite hiding-places for the larvae might be elim- 
inated. In badly infested houses, tarred building 



Miss Fields, long a resident of Southern China, 
says she renders her house immune from fleas by 
dissolving alum in the v^hitevirash or the calcimine 
when it is applied to the walls. She also places 
sheets of thick paper, dipped in a solution of alum, 
under the matting and scatters pulverized alum in 
all crevices where the insects might breed. Pow- 
dered alum, she states, may be scattered on the 
carpet and swept into its meshes without injury. 
Dr. Henry Skinner has had good results with the 
use of flake naphthalene. He said that he "took 
one room at a time, scattered on the floor 5 pounds 
of flake naphthalene and closed it for 24 hours. 
On entering such a room the naphthalene vapor 
will instantly bring tears to the eyes and cause 
coughing and irritation of the air passages. . . . 
It proved to be a perfect remedy and very inex- 
pensive as the naphthalene could be swept up and 
transferred to other rooms." 

BEETLES 

paper may be placed beneath the carpets, but the 
odor from such paper is not always pleasant. 

The carpet may be loosely tacked about the 
edges, thus affording the owner an opportunity to 
examine it so as to see whether the pests have re- 
turned. The following is a good account of the 
manner in which one housekeeper finally got rid 
of the pests: *'My own experience with them be- 
gan last year. We moved to our present abode in 
April, and it was not until every carpet had been 
put down and the house settled that I was aware 
that we had such unwelcome guests. I was not 
long in observing their habit of running into any 
crack and crevice that presented itself, and also run- 
ning along the joints of the floors, and our w^arfare 
against them was directed toward these joints. In 
the closets we stopped up every nook on the avails; 
every crevice under the baseboards, and filled up 
the joints of the floors; then we laid down oilcloth, 
and kept a plentiful supply of camphor in the 
closets. 1 am happy to say that we have had no 
trouble with them since so doing. 

"Fortunately, we had put paper under all the 
carpets, so we felt that they were in a measure, at 
least, protected, but I found them continually, just 
under the edges of the carpet. As far as possible 
we filled up the crevices under the baseboards and 
I used benzine plentifully all the summer, saturat- 
ing the borders of the carpets every two weeks 
and killing all I saw^ in the meantime. Last spring 
we varnished the cracks of the floors, and in some 
cases, where they were open, covered them with 
strips of thin muslin stuck down with the varnish; 
^ve again put paper under the carpets, as we had 
found it such protection the previous year. 1 have 
found the various insect powders of no use what- 
ever when the insect is in the larval state; whether

or not is has any effect on the beetle 1 cannot say; 
but this i can state — that our unceasing warfare 
has not been in vain, for I have, during the past 
aummer, seen only single ones where last year I 
found scores." 

Hydrocyanic Acid Gas — This gas is quite as 
effectual for the carpet beetle as it is for the bed- 
bug (see Bedbugs). 

Sulfur — The fumes of sulfur are quite as effec- 
tive as hydrocyanic acid gas if enough of the sul- 
fur is burned at one time. Not less than 2 pounds 
of sulfur to 1,000 cubic feet of space should be 
used. The room should be tightly calked and 
closed as described in the chapter on bedbugs. 
We would again call attention to the injury that 
may result from sulful fumes to metals, wall 
papers, and similar furnishings. 

Corrosive Sublimate and Alcohol — As we have 
pointed out, the larvae congregate mostly about the 
edges of the carpets. It is said that a solution of 
60 grains of corrosive sublimate, dissolved in I pint 
of alcohol, and applied to the edges and under- 



sides of the carpet around the borders, will poison 
the larvae when they begin to eat the fabric. The 
alcohol quickly evaporates and leaves the corro- 
sive sublimate among the fibers of the carpet, where 
it will remain for a long time. Since corrosive 
sublimate is such a virulent poison, great care 
must be exercised when children are likely to play 
about the room, lest they get hold of some of the 
material and become poisoned. 

Trapping the Larvae — The larvae may be trapped 
by placing woolen cloths, especially red ones, in 
closets. Among these the larvae will congregate 
and may be caught and killed by shaking the 
cloths once a week over a piece of paper. If per- 
sistent effort is made, many of them may be killed. 

Protection of Furs and Woolens — These may be 
stored in boxes in exactly the same manner as is 
described in the chapter on clothes moths. The 
box arranged for the application of carbon bisulfid 
serves as well in protecting materials from the car- 
pet beetle as from the clothes moths. 



LARDER BEETLES 



Methods of Control — In the first place, the 
beetles are easily seen and may be caught by hand 
and killed. This may be the most satisfactory way 
of dealing with them if they are not too abundant. 

Cheese is very attractive to the beetles; if pieces 
are exposed here and there the beetles will con- 
gregate and may be caught and killed in consid- 
erable numbers. Cheese ground up and poisoned 
with arsenic, and then placed in the haunts of the 
beetles, will often kill many of them. 

When hams and shoulders are put away they 
should be bagged as early as possible after being 
cured and should be wrapped with great care. If 



the least crack or opening is left the larvs will 
find entrance. 

If a ham or similar food should become infested 
with the grubs, the part containing them should be 
cut away and burned; the remaining part of the 
meat should be treated with a dilute solution of 
carbolic acid. 

If the beetles become abundant, and there are 
many hiding-places, the room in ^vhich they are 
present should be entirely cleared of food products 
and anything else that may interfere with the work 
of cleaning. The storerooni should then be thor- 
oughly cleaned and finally sprayed ^vith benzine 
or fumigated with carbon bisulfid. 



FISH MOTHS 



Methods of Control — Usually books stored in 
moist basements or other damp rooms are the 
most seriously injured. This, of course, suggests 
airy, dry rooms for the storage of books or valu- 
able papers if one wishes to preserve them free 
from injury by the fish moth. 

Another common method of preventing injury 
to books and papers is by the frequent use of bu- 
hach powder. Fresh buhach should be sprinkled 
freely on the shelves and on the books themselves. 
Moreover, this treatment should be given frequently 
where these pests are abundant and persistent, 
because the poivder so soon loses its strength. 
In badly infested houses, starched clothes, stiffened 



silk, and similar fabrics should not be allowed to 
remain too long packed away in drawers or loose 
in chests or boxes. 

It is customary for librarians to poison sweet- 
ened paste with white arsenic, spread the mixture 
on pieces of cardboard, and slip the latter about 
on shelves among the infested books as bait for 
the fish moths. It would seem that a like method 
of procedure, in which glue is substituted for the 
starch matter, might also succeed in killing the 
pests. These pieces of cardboard might be placed 
about among garments or other stored fabrics if 
injury by the fish moth is anticipated.

MISCELLANIES 



To Dispose of Mice — The "harmless, neecssary 
cat" is usually the best mice exterminator. Mice 
will not stay long in a home where there Is a cat. 
But in many places a cat is not wanted; in city 
apartments they are a great deal of trouble, and 
it must be admitted that in the country they are as 
capable exterminators of the desirable songbird as 
of the undesirable mice. Cayenne pepper, in bags 
at mice holes, or sprinkled down them, or rags 
dipped in water and then in the pepper and stuffed 
in the holes, will drive mice elsewhere. Or scatter 
camphor about where they run and in their holes; 
they very much dislike it, and will leave Tvhere its 
odor is apparent to them at all. 

Red Ants are also driven away by the odor of 
camphor gum. Camphor may be placed quite near 
food which the ants are after, as it does not "ab- 
sorb" into or affect the food at all. 

When ants are running, dip a sponge or some 
fluffy cotton in sweetened water and place it in 
their path; they will immediately infest it, then drop 
it in hot water, clean and repeat. Then sprinkle 
the camphor to drive away the late comers. 

For Roaches, as well as ants, borax is efficacious. 
Do not moisten it, but mix it powdered with gum 
camphor, or even sprinkle the borax alone, thickly, 
over the closet shelves and into the cracks which 
seem to be infested. It may take several applica- 
tions, as roaches are persistent; but in the end will 
effectually banish them. 

Moths or Mice will not invade paper boxes, or 
boxes covered "with paper, or scrap books, etc., or 
books packed in boxes, if alum is used in the paste 
with which the paper covering the boxes, etc., is 
pasted on. 

To Prevent Moths before putting away shades or 
rugs, sprinkle with cayenne pepper. Use it any- 
where else, in place of "moth balls" (camphor) 
where the pepper itself would later not be objec- 
tionable as in the case of clothes. 

Water Bugs — A weak solution of turpentine 
poured down the water pipes once a week will 
drive away water bugs. 

Flies may be kept away from such things as gilt 
frames by going over these with a soft brush dipped 
in a pint of water in which three or four onions 
have been boiled. 

To Wash Linoleum — Varnish new linoleum with 
a good quality of varnish before it is used. This 
really doubles its life. Never use soap in scrubbing 
linoleum, but put a cup of kerosene into the pail 
of water, wash thoroughly and dry off with a soft 
cloth. If it is varnished a rub over with one of 
the oiled mops will keep it in perfect condition. 



New linoleums should have two coats of varnish 
and will be all the better for three. 

Oiled and Varnished Wood should be simply 
wiped with a flannel cloth wrung out of warm 
water. Grained wood should be w^ashed with cold 
tea. Painted wood may be washed in warm water 
with a few drops of ammonia used. 

Smoked Ceilings that have been blackened by 
lamp or gas soot, may be washed off vrith soda 
water. 

Broken Walls may be filled in with a mixture of 
wrhite and plaster of paris made into a paste with 
water, or with vinegar if it hardens too fast for 
use. Cover over with paper to match that on wall. 

Dustless Dusters After washing, ordinary dus- 
ters dipped in kerosene and dried in the open air, 
make excellent home-made "dustless" dusters. Dry 
mops may be similarly treated with good effect. 

A Wood-Box Problem (or Coal Box) ^The box 

is usually full when you want to sweep. Put 
casters on it, so you can move it around easily. 

To Keep Sponges soft and clean, wash them in 
warm v\rater containing a little tartaric acid, then 
rinse in plenty of cold water. Do not put in too 
much of the acid, or have the w^ater very hot, or 
you may spoil the sponge; be sure to w^ash the 
acid out thoroughly. 

Hot Water Bottles, Bags, Pans, Jugs, should be 
hung or turned upside down when not in use, to 
thoroughly drain. With rubber bags, however, as 
soon as w^ell drained, but before entirely dried out 
inside, put in the stopper, so as to retain a little of 
the moist air (but no v^rater) as this moist air will 
make the rubber last longer and remain soft and 
flexible better than too dry air such as would other- 
wise replace the moist air if left hanging open in a 
warm dry room. 

Saving Soap — Quantities of soap are thrown 
away. When a cake has dwindled to a thin piece 
it is usually discarded, or breaks up and is wasted. 
Two or three such pieces may be moistened and 
allowed to stand until soft, then stuck together and 
pressed into a respectable cake; or the thin pieces 
may be kept in a can or bowl until a sufficient 
number are collected, then covered with about 
four times as much water as there is soap and 
boiled until the soap is dissolved. This makes a 
soft soap that is invaluable where suds are wanted. 
A teaspoonful of the soft soap will serve for a dish- 
pan of water and will be found more convenient 
than cake soap. 

To Stop a Leak A temporary stopping of a leak 

in a water or gas pipe is easily effected with a paste

made of yellow soap and whiting. This, of course, 
should not prevent one's sending immediately for 
the plumber, but it will make waiting for him less 
trying. 

White Enamel — To keep white enamel sink and 
bath tub clean and beautifully white give them a 
good rubbing with a cloth wet with kerosene, then 
rinse with hot soap suds. Dirt will instantly disap- 
pear from sinks, bath tubs and wash bowls, if a 
woollen cloth dampened in gasoline is used. 



Water Bugs — A weak solution of turpentine 
poured down the water pipes once a week will 
drive away water bugs. 

When Leaving Home for any length of time pour 
about half a cupful of kerosene in the wash bowl, 
closet, laundry tubs, sink, etc. This will prevent 
sewer gas or water bugs from coming into the 
house, and the odor will disappear in a few hours.

A GOOD HOME-MADE LAUNDRY LIST 

Take an ordinary scratch pad and paste the back of it on the 
right hand side of a cardboard, the latter cut with an inch margin 
above the pad and a two-inch margin to left of pad. 

Write on a two-inch slip of paper, preferably typewrite, 
alphabetically, the names of all laundry articles. To avoid oversight 
of important articles follow a printed laundry list — or you can cut up 
and use the printed Hst itself. Paste this on the two-inch margin to 
left of pad. Obviously the pad must be as long as the list when 
written out — and do not have the articles on the list too close together. 

Each week write on pad the number of out-going articles, 
opposite the names on the list. Check them off when returned and 
tear the sheet off pad, leaving fresh sheet for the next week. 

WATER 

The following matter is taken from Cornell Reading Course, Bulletin Farm House 
Series No. 3, "The Laundry." 

A bountiful supply of good water for laundry purposes is an important factor in 
successful laundering. Water is the natural solvent for much of the dirt that accumulates on 
clothing; moreover, it acts as a carrier to rid the clothing of all forms of dirt, both soluble 
and insoluble. Unfortunately, good drinking water is not necessarily equally good for laun- 
dry purposes, as water may hold in solution substances not hurtful to health but very detri- 
mental to cleaning purposes. A water good for the laundry should be clean, soft, clear, odor- 
free from discoloration, free from iron, free from organic matter. 

HARD AND SOFT WATER 



The characteristic known as hardness, possessed 
by some waters, is due to the presence of lime 
salts. Hard water is not the best for laundry pur- 
poses, as lime salts decompose the soap used and 
form in its place an insoluble lime soap, which 
collects as a curd on the surface of the water. 
Such soap decomposition takes place as long as 
any lime remains in the water and the cleaning 



(detergent) properties of soap are not in opera- 
tion until every bit of lime has combined w^ith soap 
to form lim;e soap. By leaving minute particles of 
lime soap in its pores, hard water is said to w^eaken 
a fabric. If the available supply of water is hard, 
then, the problem of the housekeeper is to find 
some means of removing ilme or of reducing its 
ill effects.

MATERIALS FOR SOFTENING WATER 



Washing Soda (sodium carbonate) — ^Washing 
soda is the best alkaU to soften water for general 
household use, for while effective in its action, it 
is not so corrosive as to render its handling diffi- 
cult or its use unduly harmful, nor is it expensive. 
It should never be used in its dry form, however, 
for it is an alkali sufficiently strong to eat holes in 
a fabric if it is used in full strength, and wherever 
a particle of the dry substance falls a strong solu- 
tion is formed. Carelessness causes many of the 
complaints against present-day laundry methods. 

Lye (sodium hydroxid or caustic soda) — Lye is 
an alkali of far greater strength than washing soda; 
one pound of lye being equal to about twelve 
pounds of washing soda, it should be used with 
just so much the greater caution. It should never 
be used save in solution, and as the solution de- 
teriorates very rapidly on exposure to air, if any 
quantity is made it should be kept in bottles or jars 
tightly stoppered with rubber stoppers. The com- 
pound formed by exposing lye to the action of air 
and water, is washing soda, so there is no advant- 
age in using it after all. Lye is much more diffi- 
cult to handle, and its action is so much more 
corrosive than is that of other alkalis that it is not 
advisable to use it in the home laundry. 

Borax (sodium biborate) — One of the mildest 
alkalis to use in the laundry is borax. This alkali 
is more expensive than either lye or washing soda 
and is not so vigorous in its action; but in some in- 
stances it is greatly to be preferred to either lye or 
washing soda. Washing soda and lye, unless they 
are thoroughly rinsed from clothing, have a ten- 



dency to cause yellowing, particularly when starch 
is used afterwards. Borax, on the other hand, has 
a tendency to whiten fabrics and is added directly 
to starch, in order to give it good color and to 
increase its clearness. When colored fabrics or 
wools are to be washed in hard water, borax is one 
of the best alkalis to use for softening the water; 
therefore it should be on the laundry shelf for that 
purpose if for no other. 

Ammonia (ammonium hydroxid) — Ammonia is 
another good alkali for softening water when it is 
not advisable to use stronger alkalis. Ammonia is 
a very volatile substance, consequently it should 
be used only when the laundry process is to be 
conducted quickly. It is better and cheaper to 
purchase the full-strength ammonia from a drug- 
gist and then dilute it, than to buy the article 
known as household ammonia, which is of un- 
known strength. 

To Soften Water — Water may be softened by 
any of the following methods: 

1 . For each gallon of water, use two table- 
spoons of a solution made by dissolving one pound 
of washing soda in one quart of boiling water. 
The solution should be bottled and kept on hand, 
as it is a useful cleansing agent (detergent). 

2. For each gallon of water use one-fourth 
tablespoon of lye dissolved in one cup of vyater. 

3. For each gallon of Vkrater use one tabelspoon 
of borax dissolved in one cup of water. 

If vrater is very hard, increase the amount of 
alkali used. 



ORGANIC MATTER 



Organic material may be precipitated by the use 
of alum in the form of an alum-borax mixture. 
The sediment should be allowed to settle and the 
water may then be drawn from the top. 

To Remove Organic Matter — For each gallon of 
water use one tablespoon of a mixture made up of 



two-thirds borax and one-third alum. If the water 
is rich in organic matter, use more than one table- 
spoon of the mixture. When water is very scarce, 
alum is sometimes used to separate the dirt from 
the water and the water is then filtered and used 
again. 



THE WORK ON WASH-DAY 

Before taking up short-cuts in washing, let us see if we can lessen the actual 
bulk of w^ash-day. Table cloths can be saved by frequent use of bleached crash 
runners for breakfast and luncheon; also they make a desirable change in artistic 
table appearance. They are smaller and easier to wash and iron than heavy linen 
covers. 

Paper napkins and paper cloths, which come in sets, also make a desirable 
change, are cheap, and save laundry. They are especially suitable for informal 
luncheons and for summer. The bare polished table, with a few doilies, may be 
frequently used. 

Use lightweight knit union underwear instead of muslin. Use crepe for 
nightgowns, petticoats, house dresses, and children's dresses and boys' waists; 
they wash quickly, require no starch and need not be ironed. Small children may 
use rompers and save petticoats. 

PREPARING FOR THE WASH 

Sort your washing for different tubs. Put table linen and other comparatively clean 
articles into one, the next cleanest into another, etc. Soak handkerchiefs in a basin of salt 
water, pour soapy water over them and put them into one of the "clean goods" tubs. If 
colds have prevailed in the family, the handkerchiefs should be put to soak in a solution of 
boric acid by themselves, and should be separately washed and boiled for twenty minutes. 

Soak the clothes overnight in cold water. In the morning fill washing machine with 
scalding water, cut in the soap and put in the first tub of clothes. Run the tub 15 minutes; 
the second while you are rinsing and bluing the clothes from the first. If you use the scalding 
process it is not necessary to boil the clothes oftener than once monthly. Washing with naph- 
tha soap will obviate boiling even that often. The naphtha soap should be shaved into a 
tub of lukewarm water at noon the day before. Put in the first tub of clothes to soak, and at 
night time run the washer with these, wring them and put in rinsing water; put the rest of 
the white clothes into soak until morning. 

In the morning take out part of the clothes and run in washer; let the colored clothes 
soak while you hang out the white. By this method you can get the entire washing on the 
line early in the morning; and breaking up the work over the two days does not leave you 
worn out. 

To Wash with ParafBn (Cornell Reading Course) — Apparatus: paraffin wax, laun- 
dry soap, soft water, clothes boiler, saucepan, laundry tub and w^ringer. 

Soak the clothes overnight in cold soft water. 

Shred Yl cupful of paraffin and Yi pound bar of soap, and melt each in 1 pint of 
hot water. 

Fill the boiler with soft water and bring to boiling point; add the paraffin mixture. 

Wring the clothes out of the water in which they are soaking, put them in the boiler, 
and boil Yl hour. 

Remove the clothes to a tub of soft, warm water, or a washing machine, and rinse 
the soapsuds well out of them. Only the very dirty parts need to be rubbed. This rinsing 
water must be kept as warm as possible. 

Rinse in clear cold water. Rinse in bluing ^vater. 

(Note) — For a washing of about five boilerfuls, prepare twice the amount of par- 
affin and soap, putting one-half of it in the first boilerful and adding more to each succeed- 
ing boilerful of clothes. 



342 THE HOME-KEE PING BOOK— Section VI— LAUNDRY, IRONING BOARD 

GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR WASHING 

(From Cornell Reading Course, Farm House Series No. 3, "The Laundry") 

Directions for Washing — Have plenty of hot water before beginning the washing. 
If possible the water should be soft; if it is not, soften it (see methods for softening under 
"WATER"). 

Make a soap solution; use 1 cake of soap to 2 or 3 quarts of water. 
Rinse the clothes from water in which they were soaked, removing as much of the 
dirt as possible. Parts of the clothing that are very much soiled should be rubbed a little 
and rinsed in fresh water before the garments are put into a tub or a washing machine. The 
precaution of rinsing saves wear and tear on the whole garment. 

Pour warm water into tub or washing machine; if the water is hard, soften it with 
washing-soda solution or borax. Add enough soap solution or soap to make a good suds. 
A tablespoonful of turpentine, kerosene, or benzine may be added to the washing water as 
well as to the water in which clothing has soaked. Put in clothes to be washed. Rubbing 
is essential for soiled garments; it may be accomplished in one of two ways; by using the 
washboard and old-fashioned tub, or by using a washing machine. It is well to have a 
board for very soiled parts, such as hems and edges, but the washing machine is a great 
improvement on the older method. 

Whenever the water becomes dirty, use fresh suds. Clothes cannot be made clean 
without the use of plenty of water. Keep up a good suds while washing, and add hot water 
from time to time. If a washing machine is used, do not put enough water in the machine 
to float the clothes; if you should they would escape the mechanical action of the dasher and 
would not be sufficiently rubbed. Clothes should be wrung from the wash water through the 
wringer. The screws of the wringer should be adjusted to bring its rolls close together, and 
clothing should be folded so as to give it an even thickness in passing through the wringer; 
for heavier garments loosen the screws of the wringer. Fold in buttons and hooks and 
turn the wringer slowly. 

A second suds is generally necessary, though it may be omitted if the clothing has 
been only slightly soiled. Shake out clothes wrung from the first suds, look them over for 
soiled parts, turn them wrong side out, and drop them into second suds. Wash and wring 
them ready for boiling. 

Clothes should be clean before they are boiled, as the boiling process is intended 
not so much to remove visible dirt as to destroy germs and purify the clothing as well as 
to whiten it. Boiling is omitted when a naphtha soap is used, as the soap loses its effect in 
very hot water; it is asserted that boiling is not needed because naphtha itself is a purifier. 
Nevertheless, at least once a month, the clothing washed at other times with naphtha soap 
should be boiled. 

Fill the boiler half full of cold water; if the water is hard, soften it. Add enough 
soap solution to make a light suds. Half fill the boiler with clothes, wrung and shaken out 
from the last suds. Use plenty of water and do not put too many clothes into the boiler. 
Bring the water very gradually to the boiling point and boil 1 minutes. 

Kerosene or turpentine is sometimes added to the boiling water to counteract the 
yellow color given clothing by the use of the dark resin soaps. It is better to avoid kero- 
sene and turpentine at this point if possible, as clothing treated by them require very thor- 
ough rinsing to remove the odor. Each boilerful of clothes should be started with clean cold 
water. Cloths or clothes containing lampblack or machine oil may be placed in the hot water 
left after the last clothes have been wrung from it. Kerosene or turpentine should then be 
added, as they are the solvents for such dirt. 



LAUNDRY, IRONING BOARD— GENERAL DIRECTIONS, WASHING 343 

Rinsing is an important part of the washing process, for if soap or some of the 
strong alkalis are left in the cloth they may be very detrimental in the bluing or starching 
process. 

If water is hard it should be softened for rinsing with either borax or ammonia and 
not with washing soda. The rinsing water should be hot. The clothes should be slowly 
lifted with a clean stick from the boiler into a dishpan, and drained or wrung or shaken 
before being put into the rinse water. It is not always practicable to use more than one 
rinse water before bluing the clothes, but better results are obtained when the clothes are 
rinsed more than once. With some kinds of bluing, the presence of soap or alkali precipi- 
tates the blue as iron rust. If the starch used is not pure, and any lye or washing soda or 
soap has been left in the cloth, a yellow color is produced from the starch impurities by the 
action of those alkalis. Wring from the rinsing water and shake out the garments. 

Bluing — It is impossible to give any rule for the amount of bluing to use or the depth 
of color to be decided upon. Some fabrics, such as soft, loosely-woven fabrics, absorb more 
bluing than others. The amount of bluing to be used is a matter of experimentation by the 
launderer. Clothing should not be allowed to stand in the bluing water, as they might 
become streaked. 

If a ball bluing is used tie it in a thick cloth, wet, and squeeze it into a bowlful of 
hot water. Use a part of the resulting bluing solution for bluing the water. More of the 
bluing in the bowl should be added to the bluing in the tub from time to time as the cloth- 
ing takes it up. As some kinds of bluing are in the form of minute particles, the bluing 
water should be stirred each time before adding clothes to it. After they are wrung, un- 
starched clothes will then be ready for drying. 

Starching — Make the starch according to directions. Starch those garments requir- 
ing thick starch first, as moisture from the clothing gradually thins the starch and a medium 
stiff, medium thin, and thin starch gradually result. 

Stiff Starch — Collars, cuffs, shirt-bosoms. 

Medium Stiff Starch — Shirt waists, collars and cuffs, coarse lace curtains. 

Medium Thin Starch — White petticoats, duck skirts, and some dresses. 

Thin Starch — Skirts and dresses when a stiff finish is not desired; shirt waists. 

Clear Starch — Infants' dresses, fine laces, curtains, light-weight table linen when it is 
desirable to give it some body. 

Raw Starch — Collars, cuffs, shirt-bosoms when an extra stiffness is desired; some 
light curtains. 

The starch should be thoroughly worked into the cloth so as to distribute it evenly 
through the threads of the fabric. Such working insures a smooth, even stiffness and pre- 
vents starch spots in ironing. AH garments starched with boiled starch should be dried 
thoroughly before being dampened. They should be dampened several hours before being 
ironed. If articles are to be raw-starched they should be thoroughly dried first. They are 
then dipped into the raw starch and rubbed as for washing, squeezed dry, and spread out 
on a clean sheet or cloth, but not one over the other. They should cover only half the 
sheet. The other half of the sheet should be folded over them. Then the sheet with its 
contents should be rolled tightly and stand for 2 or 3 hours to insure even distribution of 
moisture. 

Drying — When possible the process of drying should accomplish more than the mere 
removal of moisture. Clothing should be hung where it will be freely exposed to the action 
of fresh air and sunshine. Such exposure purifies and bleaches at the same time. In many 
commercial laundries a chemical bleach is used to whiten clothing that is necessarily dried 
in steam closets, and consequently does not have the beneficial bleaching action of sunshine. 



344 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Section VI— LAUNDRY, IRONING BOARD 

The home launderer does not often have to consider the need for commercial bleaching 
agents. 

TTie launderer should be provided with a clothespin bag, or, better still, with a 
clothespin apron having a deep pocket, good and wide. 

When possible, lines should be taken down each week, but when they cannot be 
they should be well wiped with a damp cloth before hanging up clothes. The clothespins 
should be clean. Each article should be turned wrong side out and hung with the threads 
of the material straight; the garment should be shaped as nearly as possible in its natural 
shape. Avoid hanging pieces by comers, for thus hung they will be pulled out of shape. 
Fasten garments by their bands when possible. Table linen, bed linen and towels 
should be pinned in at least four places, as it is nearly impossible to iron properly a piece 
that was improperly hung. Careful hanging greatly reduces the labor of ironing. When the 
clothes are brought in from the line the clothespins should be put into the apron or basket 
kept for that purpose and placed where they will be kept clean. 

Starched pieces should not be allowed to freeze, and should be removed from the 
line as soon as dry. Long hanging reduces their stiffness. If flannel underwear is properly 
stretched and hung it may be folded and put away without further treatment. 

Dampening — Clothes should be dampened some hours before being ironed, because 
during the interval between nioistening and ironing the moisture becomes distributed evenly 
and does away with the necessity of using a superfluous amount of water. The dampening 
is best done at night, but only as many articles should be sprinkled as can be ironed next 
day, for damp fabrics will mildew if left wet for a few days, especially in hot weather. Al- 
though clothes should be well dampened, they should not be drenched. Very often trouble 
in ironing starched pieces is owing to overwetting. The starched part is soaked and made 
limp and sticky. A clean whisk broom kept for the purpose is the best thing to use for 
sprinkling clothes. Some persons have used a toy sprinkling pot. There is, however, a 
danger in its use, for it may rust and give rise to rust spots on clothes. Large pieces should 
be sprinkled and folded separately. Small pieces may be sprinkled and laid together be- 
fore folding. Care should be taken to fold and roll garments smoothly, as this aids in their 
ironing. The rolls of dampened pieces should be packed closely in a basket lined with a 
clean cloth and covered with a clean cloth. 

Table linen and other linen should be made very damp, not wet. If table linen is 
sprinkled with a mixture of 1 part alcohol and 4 parts water, the result after ironing will be 
a slight stiffness resembling that of new linen. 

If an ironing machine is used, unstarched pieces may be removed from the line while 
still damp and ironed immediately without the preliminary sprinkling. 

Washing Colored Clothing — The processes of dyeing have so improved that almost 
all wash goods are now considered to have fast colors. This is particularly true of the better 
grades of fabrics, in which the dye seems to attach itself with especial firmness to the fibers 
of the cloth. Though a color may be said to be fast, it is only relatively fast. Colored goods 
require more careful treatment than do white goods. The conditions that most affect the 
stability of colors in fabrics are: long-continued action of water and soap; strong alkalis or 
acids; strong sunlight, which is a powerful bleaching agent and is used frequently for bleach- 
ing. 

In washing colored clothing, the factors just enumerated should be kept in mind. 
Colored clothing should not be soaked for any length of time unless its color is known to be 
very stable. Any soap used in the washing process should be a mild soap in solution, or if 
the color of the goods to be washed is very delicate the soap solution should be replaced 
by soap bark, bran, rice -water, potato water, or cooked-starch water. The washing process 
should be conducted quickly, and in water not very hot. After washing, colored garments 



LAUNDRY. IRONING BOARD— GENERAL DIRECTIONS, W ASHING 345 

should be turned inside out and hung in a very shady or dark place, and should be taken 
in as soon as dry. Fading is more often owing to careless drying than to any fault in wash- 
ing. Washing powders and strong alkalis should never be used with colored clothing. If 
the water needs softening, use borax. If starch, bran, rice water, etc., are substituted for 
soap, use the mixture as if it were soapsuds. 

In starching colored clothes, rub the starch in thoroughly and wipe off any excess 
of it; no difficulty will then be experienced with w^hite starch spots. 

To Set Color — Sometimes a fabric shows a decided tendency to fade even under the 
best washing conditions. It is always well if there is any doubt about fading to test a small 
piece of the cloth before washing it. If the color fades, then an attempt should be made 
to set it. With most colors the dyer uses chemical substances which cause a firmer union 
between the color and the cloth. Such substances are called mordants. The process of 
making a color fast may sometimes satisfactorily be used by the housekeeper to strengthen 
weak colors. The household mordants are brine, vinegar, sugar of lead, and alum, used in 
the following proportions: 

To 1 gallon of water add Yz cupful mild vinegar, or 2 cupfuls salt, or I tablespoon- 
ful alum, or 1 tablespoonful sugar of lead (poison). 

Vinegar is best for pinks. Small pieces of cloth should be tested in each of the 
above solutions and a choice made after the test. TTie cloth of which the color is to be made 
fast should be left in the mordant solution over night, and may be left in for several days 
with good results. It should be thoroughly dried before being washed. Even with rela- 
tively strong colors, soaking a fabric over night in a brine solution before washing it for the 
first time may render it far less susceptible to fading influences than it otherwise would be. 
The effect of brine, however, is said not to be lasting. Colored goods are often rinsed in 
a dilute salt solution just before drying them. 

THE LAUNDERING AND CARE OF WOOLENS 

All w^aters which touch woolens should be of the same temperature. There 
are scientific reasons for this, not necessary to expound here. Woolens should not 
be w^ashed in both hot and cold water ; nor should woolens ever be rubbed. It is 
such treatment that causes shrinkage. 

Strong alkalies, soda, lye, washing powders, should be avoided. If necessary 
to soften the water, or to cut grease or neutralize any acids used to remove stains, 
use borax or ammonia. 

Woolen Blankets are ruined if put in tub and washed like cotton goods. Shake them 
first, to remove all dust. Then look for spots and mark same with a few stitches of white 
thread (colored thread might fade and leave a mark). 

Measure the blankets and set a pair of curtain stretchers ready to take them — they 
may be stretched doubled if double blankets. 

Don't rub soap directly on them — use a soap solution, made by shaving a bar of 
good, white neutral soap in cold water, heating to boiling point, allowing to cool, then add- 
ing 2 tablespoonfuls of powdered borax and Yi cupful of wood or denatured alcohol. 

Temperature of all waters used for woolens should be about 1 1 degrees F. Work 
blankets up and down, squeeze them lightly, but don't rub. Badly soiled places stretch over 
a smooth surface and use a brush with the soap solution. Don't use a wringer, except very 
lightly adjusted, and keep the blanket flat, not stretched, pulled or crumpled. 

Drying — Don't let lie about wet. Don't wash but one blanket at a time. Unless 
you use frames, hang straight on a clean, light line; use plenty of clothespins. Don't dry 



346 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Section VI— LAUNDRY, IRONING BOARD 

in direct rays of the sun; it will yellow the blanket; select a bright place in a light wind. 
During drying, use often a whisk broom with lengthwise stroke to rub up the nap. When 
perfectly dry, rub with a flannel cloth in a dry room until blanket is light and fluffy. 

Colored Woolens will come out drab or streaked unless you set the colors. For 
red, light blue, tan and brown, soak about 1 minutes in a solution of 1 ounce sugar of lead 
to 1 gallon of water. For purple, green, mauve or blue (predominating) soak in alum water, 
1 ounce alum to 1 gallon of water. Yellows, buff, tans, you w^ill improve with 1 cupful of 
strained coffee added to last rinsing water. 

To Bleach Blankets which have yellowed, use hydrogen peroxide diluted to about 
an eighth of its strength, steeping the blankets over night. 

Sweaters — ^To retain original shape, take the important measurements before wet- 
ting, and stretch to these measurements while drying. Use, otherwise, same method as for 
blankets. 

To Bleach Sweater — Hang it while still wet in an upturned barrel, stretched to its 
proper measurements. Burn a sulphur candle (procurable at any drug store) under the 
barrel. The bottom of the barrel, however, is first knocked out, as well as top, leaving only 
the cylinder. Now stretch a cloth over the barrel to keep the sulphur fumes in; occasionally 
remove this to shake out the folds of the sweater. About an hour and a half treatment 
will suffice for perfect whiteness. Wash in soapy water to remove sulphur odor. 

Radiator Drying is not good. It may steam woolens; they should dry slowly. They 
should not be pressed with an iron hot enough to make them steam in the ironing. 

CORNELL COURSE ON WASHING WOOLENS 

Washing Woolens (Cornell Reading Course) — The action of water and alkalis 
upon wool has been thoroughly studied. Strong soaps should never be used in washing 
woolens, nor should soap be applied directly to the garment. The soap should be used in 
solution. A great deal of stress is laid upon having the vrater used in washing flannels not 
much more than lukewarm, for at a lukewarm temperature soap and water have a less 
detrimental action on wool than at any other temperature. It is even more important than 
the lukewarm water to have all the waters used of the same temperature, in order to avoid 
changes from hot to cold water, or vice versa, as sudden changes in temperature cause 
shrinkage. 

Have two receptacles ready for washing flannels. Pour into one of them water not 
too hot for the hand to bear comfortably. Add enough soap solution made from a neutral 
or mild soap or a wool soap to make a good suds. If the water is hard, or the clothing is 
very much soiled, add a tablespoonful of borax or ammonia for each gallon of water used. 
Shake or brush the garments free from dust, and put them into the water to soak for 1 or 
1 5 minutes. Before beginning to wash the flannels, prepare a second tub of water having 
the same temperature as that of the first or a slightly higher temperature. Wash one gar- 
ment at a time by drawing through the hands and washing up and down in the water; avoid 
rubbing if possible. Pass the garments from the first to the second water; the second water 
should be a suds if the first suds has not removed all the soil. Rinse free of soap in sev- 
eral waters; be sure to keep the temperature constant. Wring through a loosely set wringer. 
Turn wrong side out and hang in a warm place, but not near a fire, as heat will cause shrink- 
age. When nearly dry, turn. When drying, shape by pulling and stretching. 

It is a mistake to ascribe all the shrinkage in woolen garments to washing. The 
moisture, heat, and movements of the body may cause a marked shrinkage. 



LAUNDRY, IRONING BOARD— GENERAL DIRECTIONS. WASHING 347 

If flannels are to be pressed, they should be allowed to dry first, and should then be 
covered with a slightly dampened piece of cheesecloth and ironed with a moderately hot 
iron. The cheesecloth draws up the fibers of the flannel, giving it the fluffy appearance of 
a new garment. Underwear and woolen stockings should be stretched into shape and 
should not be ironed. For very soiled garments special soap formula for the purpose will 
be useful. 

Blankets are washed in the same way as other woolens, except that because of 
their size, only two blankets or only one pair of them are washed at a time, and fresh water 
is used for each pair. After wringing, they may be stretched and dried on curtain stretchers. 
If stretchers are not available, blankets should hang on the line until perfectly dry, and 
occasionally the water should be squeezed from the hanging ends. To press them, fold 
them evenly and wrap them in a sheet. Keep them smooth and unwrinkled and place a 
flat board over them. Weight heavily and let them remain for several days. 

WASHING THE BED CLOTHES OTHER THAN BLANKETS 

It becomes inevitable that heavy quilts, pillow^s, etc., must from time to 
time be washed. As disagreeable a job as this is, it is not so formidable a task as 
it seems, how^ever, if properly gone over. It requires time and strength, though, 
and one should set aside a day for this. Select a bright sunny day and hire a good 
strong \voman to help. 

Blankets have been covered in another article. (See Care of Woolens.) Pillows 
ought to be renovated oftener than they usually are. It is not difficult if you put your feathers 
into a cheesecloth bag the size of the ticking. The latter can then be removed and washed 
as often as you please, and the feathers can be renovated better if in the thin cheesecloth 
bag. 

If, however, they are in the usual ticking only, prepare good hot soapsuds, made 
strong with ammonia and borax, and put them in to soak for an hour. As the water cools 
lift the pillows about, roll them and toss and slap them until the dirt is out of the feathers. 
Don't crush or squeeze them. Rinse in hot, soapy water, then in several clear waters, hang 
in the sun, turn and shake them as they dry. They can be dried, if neecssary, on steam 
radiators. 

Down and lambs' down comfortables are washed in the same way as pillows. Thick 
cotton filled comfortables can be washed so the cotton will not form into lumps, if very care- 
ful with them, especially if the tying in them is fairly close. In buying comfortables choose 
those which are of fast colors. 

Put comfortables into warm suds and let soak. Squeeze flat without twisting in 
wringer and put in a second tub of warm, soapy water; run through a washing machine or 
shift around in water, lifting up and down and slapping; do this in several soapy waters and 
finally in several clear warm waters, then squeeze and shake dry as possible and hang in a 
warm place in hot sun, shaking occasionally to fluff the down. If carefully done they come 
out as light as when new. 

Silk-covered comfortables should be sent to the cleaners; home washing will almost 
certainly spoil the silk. 

HINTS ON WOOLEN AND SILK GOODS 

To Wash a Long White Shawl — Pour boiling thumb tacks through shawl; pin sides evenly, being 

water over soap, add cold water until luke warm. careful not to stretch. Pin another layer on top 

Put shawl in. pat gently, then squeeze, don't wring. „f fj^^j ^„j continue to end of shawl and lay in 



sun till top layer is dry, then unfold top layer: 



Repeat until shawl is clean; repeat in two or three 
warm waters without soap. Lay out a bath towel, 

£ 1 »u- 1 »U1 1 Ul 1 .. continue till all layers are dry. Brush out fringe 

of several thicknesses, smoothly on a table; lay ' ' '• 

shawl on same, spread out one end to natural width "''•» fingers. The shawl will be soft, white and 

of shawl and pin to the table with sharp pins or even, as when new. 



348 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Section VI— LAUNDRY, IRONING BOARD 



Shawls, Sweaters and loosely woven jackets lose 
their shape when hung on lines to dry. To pre- 
vent this, fasten them securely with safety pins to 
a sheet stretched between two lines, or dry the 
sweaters or jackets on a "form" if you have one, 
or tack them against a sunny wall stretched only 
to the extent you want them to remain when dry. 

To Dry a Sweater another way, hang it over a 
mosquito netting hammock, the latter pulled tight, 
and the sweater spread out in position wanted and 
pinned thereto. 

Crocheted Articles of Wool — Clean them in a 
pillow case; keep them in it during the entire pro- 
cess of washing. Use abundant warm water and 
soap, and clear warm water for rinsing; hang on 
line still in the pillow case, on a bright windy day. 

New Stockings — Rinse them first time in water 
in which a teaspoonful of vinegar has been put, 
and they will not fade so readily. 

To Clean White Felt — Make a soft paste of mag- 
nesia and milk, cover the felt thickly, applying with 
a brush, leave till next day, then brush off with 
a clean hand brush. 

Black Felt such as an old derby hat, clean with 
household ammonia on a clean piece of muslin. 

Cleaning With Gasoline — For badly soiled ar- 
articles, make a strong lather of white soap dis- 
solved by hot water until it looks like jelly and 
add it to the gasoline, teacupful to a gallon. Soak 
the garment in this for I 5 minutes, then rub where 
necessary and wash between the hands; wring out 
and rinse in clean gasoline. Add a little salt to 
gasoline used for cleaning wool or silk and if pos- 
sible put a piece of cloth under it, fo "drive 
through" to, and there will be no "ring" where 
cleaned. 

The gasoline can be saved for future use; let 
the dirt settle, then pour off the liquid and cork 
tightly. It should be unnecessary to say that work 
with gasoline should be in the open air and in no 
case near a fire. 

While Kid or Satin Slippers can be sponged with 
gasoline and made fresh as new 

Gasoline Cleaned Articles require no ironing. 
To Soften Flannels that have become hard and 
shrunken, restore them by soaking in gasoline and 
shaking till dry. 

"Dry" Cleaning Men's Clothes — Take a soft 
cloth, dip it in alcohol, pass it lightly over a cake 
of pure soap and apply briskly to the goods till 
cleaned. If you can put a cloth under the goods 
much of the dirt or grease will be driven through 
to the cloth and less time required than when it 
has to be all transferred to the cleaning cloth. If 
the goods have a lining which would show stain, 
separate the goods and lining in some way to pre- 
vent this "driving through" to the lining. 



After cleaning the garment, sponge it carefully, 
then press it. The treatment, as well as cleaning 
it, restores the nap and lustre as when new. In 
the case of obstinate grease spots, rub hard with 
pure white soap lather and lukewarm water, then 
apply the alcohol and soap process as above. 

White Silk — Use lukewarm water and borax, for 
washing, instead of soap. Dry by wrapping a sheet 
or blanket and iron while just a bit damp but not 
wet. 

When washing white silk always rinse in a warm 
blueing water to keep from yellowing. Many a dry 
cleaning bill can be saved by carefully laundering 
as above. 

To make silk that has been washed look like 
new, put a teaspoonful of methylated spirits to a 
pint of running water and iron while damp. 

Silk blouses can be made to look like new by 
stiffening with a little gum arabic in the rinsing 
water. One dessert-spoonful of boiling water and 
then silk ironed while damp. 

Yellow ChiCfon — Use gasoline, plenty of it. 
Souse the chiffon in, shaking up and down and 
around, and if there are spots upon it rub them 
gently between the hands. Change the gasoline as 
it becomes cloudy for fresh. When the chiffon is 
clean hang it in the w^ind, pulling it into shape 
now and then. When you are ready to put it back 
upon the dress lay bet^veen two thicknesses of fine 
muslin slightly dampened and press with warm iron 
lightly, not to spoil the general effect. 

Chiffon Veils — Subject these to a thorough wash- 
ing with soap and w^ater. Prepare a bath of warm 
water and white soap, lay the veil in and lift up 
and down, squeezing through the hands until quite 
clean. Then rinse in clear water — warm water 
if the veil is white, and a few drops of ammonia 
if the veil is colored. To dry, pin it on table or 
bed, and iron. Although chiffon irons perfectly, 
it is more like new when not ironed, and in the 
case of a dotted veil pressing of any kind is not 
advised — the dots vrill surely show the impress. 

Net Veils — For net veils of every description 
squeeze through alcohol to freshen and remove 
dust. Wash in gasoline. Use sufficient fluid to 1 
cover the article. Squeeze through the hands sev- J 
eral times, then rinse in clear gasoline. This will * 
probably be quite black when one has finished if 
the veil is black, but when dry the veil will be a 
deep black and the dots, if any, very glossy. 

Crepe de Chine — After washing crepe de chine 
or georgette crepe in vrarm water with a mild 
w^hite soap, rinse in clear warm water, roll in a 
Turkish towel and do not iron till next day. 

Blue Serge — To remove the shine from a dark 
blue serge sponge occasionally with a strong blu- 
ing water, then press (not iron) carefully.

A Black Frock may be (reshened by sponging 
it \WtK alcohol mixed with water in the propor- 
tion of I part alcohol to 3 of water. The gar- 
ment should be sponged on the right side, but 
ironed on the wrong. 

CORNELL COURSE ON SILK 
Washing Silk (Cornell Reading Course) — Silk 
should be washed in much the same way as wool. 
While it is not so strongly affected by soaps and 
alkalies as is wool, its gloss is destroyed by the 
use of strong cleansing agents. The delicacy of 
the fiber n>akes hard rubbing impossible, for it 
breaks the fibers and destroys not only their dura- 



bility but also their silkiness. In wringing silk, 
place it between dry towels or heavy cloths and 
put it through a loosely adjusted wringer, iron it 
on the wrong side while still damp, with a mod- 
erately hot iron. Silk is very easily scorched, and 
if the iron is too hot the silk will be stiff. Push 
the iron back and forth with a wriggling motion 
to give softness and pliability to the silk. It is 
often best to iron silk under a cloth: to do so gives 
less body and a softer finish. Ribbons, if of good 
quality, may be very successfully washed. To iron 
them, cover them with a dry cloth and move the 
iron frequently back and forth over the surface of 
the cloth above them. 



UNENS AND COTTONS 



To Launder Table Linen (Cornell Reading 
Course) — Apparatus: tub. washboard or washing 
machine, soap, ironing table with blanket and 
sheet, hot irons, and cloth for cleaning irons. 

Washing — Renjove all stains. Soak overnight 
if possible in softened water. Wash in hot water, 
using soap and the board or machine. Boil or 
scald fifteen minutes in soapy water. Rinse in cold 
water. Rinse in cold bluing water. Dry out of 
doors if possible. 

Note: For old linen add I cupful of boiled 
starch to each gallon of bluing water. 

Dampening — Dampen well. Roll up tightly and 
let lie over night if possible. 

Ironing General rules: Pull well into shape. 

Have the irons very hot. Press heavily. Iron un- 
til perfectly dry. Ironing and folding a table nap- 
kin; place the napkin on the table wrong side up 
with the name on the upper right hand corner. 
Fold the lowrer edge to within ^ inch of the upper 
edge and iron. Fold the lower edge even with 
the upper edge and iron. Fold the left-hand edge 
to within J/g inch of the right-hand edge and iron. 
Turn over and iron the remaining square. Fold 
the left edge even with the right hand edge and 
iron. 

Ironing and folding a table cloth in the screen 
fold of four: Fold the cloth lengthwise, wrong side 
out. Fold again length^vise. Drop one selvage and 
bring it back to the folded edge on the opposite 
side. Place lengthwise on the ironing table and iron 
the top quarter. Open and iron the middle 
quarters. Fold the middle quarters together and 
iron the remaining quarter. . 

Note: If the cloth is very large or the table very 
narrow, it is better to fold it in two, right side out, 
iron both sides, and refold in the screen fold. 

Fine Table Linens — An authority on fine laun- 
lering says that hot water should not be used in 
/ashing line table linen or embroidered doilies. Cold 
■ater, white soap and borax, if not a borax soap. 



should be used. If a gloss is desired for linen add 
a teaspoonful of salt to the starch when making. 

WHITE LINEN AND COTTONS 
Outline for Washing (Cornell Reading Course) 
— Put water on to heat. Make soap solution. Rinse 
clothes from water in which they have soaked. 
Wash clothes in warm suds in the following order: 
Table linen and clean towels; bed linen; body lin- 
en; handkerchiefs; soiled towels and cloths; stock- 
ings. Wash again in clean suds; wring. Boil in 
clean, slightly soapy water. Rinse in clean, clear 
water; wring. Rinse in bluing 'water; wring. Starch. 
Hang to dry. Remove from line, dampen, and fold. 

COLORED LINENS AND COTTONS 

Colored Goods — Add Yl ounce of Epsom salts 
to 2 quarts of clear water and you will have a good 
mixture for rinsing colored frocks and blouses. 

A little borax in the water before washing red 
or red-bordered goods will alone often prevent 
their fading. 

Dark calicoes should be ironed on the wrong 
side with irons that are not too hot. 

To prevent the fading of ginghams, calicoes and 
lawns, dissolve 5 cents* worth of sugar of lead in 
a pailful of lukewarm water. Put the goods in and 
let stand two or three hours. Wring out. dry and 
press in the usual way. The process also shrinks 
the goods. 

To Bleach faded cotton wash in boiling cream 
of tartar water. 

Cotton Voiles — When washing cotton voiles, if 
after they are washed and dried they are dipped in 
a solution of gum arabic and water ( I teaspoonful 
powdered gum arabic to I pint), rolled in a cloth 
and ironed wet, the garments will look quite new. 

Near-Fireproofing Muslins, Laces, etc. — Muslins 
and laces may be rendered much less inflammable 
by simply mixing with the starch used in launder- 
ing an equal quantity of whiting. 



350 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Section VI— LAUNDRY, IRONING BOARD 



CURTAINS, LACES, ETC. 



Dyeing Curtains An excellent dye for lace or 

muslin curtains: save the tea-remains from the tea- 
pot; keep the tea savings and leaves in a covered 
jar, and virhen you have sufficient, strain through 
a fine sieve and add the liquid to a pan of ordinary 
starch virater Dip one end of the curtains, and if 
the color is too dark add more starch water. If 
too light add more of the tea savings. 

Net Curtains To be sure they will dry straight 

put them on the poles at the window while still 
wet, and they will fall into graceful folds, as they 
dry. Otherwise dry on a frame or pinned to a 
wall. 

If allowed to dry thoroughly before starching 
curtains will remain clean longer. 

To Wash Laces — ^White laces that have become 
discolored from perspiration should not be put im- 
mediately into hot water. Soak them first in cold 
water, rubbing them well with pure soap. If the 
pan of water is set out in the sun it will aid in the 
bleaching process. Later rinse and squeeze the 
lace in warm water and soap suds, rinsing again 
in clear water very slightly blued. Laces may also 
be bleached snowy white by basting them to card- 
board, and setting out in the sun. The laces must 
be wet when basted to the cardboard. When 
bleached and dry they will need no ironing. 

To Clean Lace Salted flour or powdered starch 

mixed with borax and rubbed into every thread 
of the lace will clean it. Lay it away with a fresh 
supply of powder for three days, then shake and 
brush it thoroughly and you will find it very clean 
and fresh. 

Another plan is to mix gasoline and powdered 
magnesia and rub this into the lace. Leave the mix- 
ture on over night and apply again. Shake out 
and brush carefully. 

Milk for Lace — It is well, when washing a piece 
of choice yellow lace, to dip it in milk before iron- 
ing. Always place a piece of tissue paper directly 
over the lace, so the warm iron will not touch the 
fabric. 

Black Lace — Wash in mixture of half vinegar 
and half water; heat together until lukewarm; wash 
without soap; rinse in a similar solution, put in a 
cloth and iron on wrong side until dry, between 
two thicknesses of cloth. 

Washing Lace Collars — First baste them on a 
piece of white cloth; they will not be torn or 
stretched, and if no starch is used they will look 
like new. 

To Clean White Lace, without laundering it, 
spread it smoothly on wrapping paper and sprinkle 



it freely with calcined magnesia, then place another 
piece of paper over it, and put av\ray under a heavy 
weight for several days. Dust off the magnesia 
and the lace will be found almost as fresh as when 
first purchased. 

Fine Laces should never be starched, they will 
generally be stiff enough if ironed while very damp, 
the ironing being continued until they are dry. 

To Clean Gold Lace Buy some rock ammonia 

from a chemist, pound it finely and apply it with 
a piece of clean flannel to the lace, rubbing briskly. 
After a thorough brushing the lace will look good 
as new^. 

To Tint Lace — Wait until it is dry after washing, 
then dip it into weak tea. If a little stiffness is de- 
sired a cube of sugar may be added to the tea. 

CORNELL COURSE ON LACES 

Washing Laces (Cornell Reading Course) — It is 
often best to dry-clean fine laces, as they thicken 
slightly in Vk'ashing. To wash them, use a warm 
neutral soap-solution to which has been added am- 
monia or borax. Squeeze out the dirt by pressing 
the lace in the hands, but do not rub it; rubbing 
breaks the delicate threads. A good way to wash 
fine lace is to baste it to strips of cheesecloth, being 
careful to catch down all its points. Put it to soak 
over night in warm soapy water containing a little 
borax or ammonia. Wash it, by squeezing, then 
rinse it free of soap. Old yellow lace may be 
bleached by stretching it, while wet, around a bot- 
tle, and standing it in the sun, rewetting the lace 
occasionally. Javelle water may be used to bleach 
lace. Lace may be stiffened by rinsing in a mix- 
ture of 2 tablespoonfuls of alcohol to I cupful of 
water; by rinsing in borax water, 2 tablespoonfuls 
to a cup; or by using gum arabic, ^ teaspoonful 
to a cupful of water. If a yellow color is desired, 
dip the lace in coffee or tea. 

Black lace should be cleaned by squeezing it 
repeatedly in a mixture of I cupful of strong coffee 
and I tablespoonful of ammonia. Rinse in gum 
arabic water made with coffee, to give natural stiff- 
ness. 

Lace curtains should be washed writh as near an 
approach to the care given to lace as is practi- 
cable. Clear-starch them, stretch them, and pin 
them out on sheets, one curtain over another. If 
available, it is better to use curtain stretchers than 
sheets, but if care is taken to square off the first 
curtain and stretch it straight and even, good re- 
sults may be obtained by pinning the curtains to 
sheets. 



LAUNDRY. IRONING BOARD— GENERAL DIRECTIONS, WASHING 35 1 



CLEANING FURS, GLOVES, ETC. 



To Clean Fur» — Hot sand and sawdust rubbed 
into furs and then beaten out with light rattan 
sticks, clean and make them look like new. Use 
clean sand. Ermine and other white furs treated 
similarly with plaster of paris and corn starch will 
be freshened and softened. 

Sponging Furs — Sponge furs with gasoline. Dry 
in the open air and brush with hat brush until 
smooth. Or sponge freely with alcohol, and while 
the fur is wet sift it down to the roots with all the 
finely powdered fuller's earth it will hold. Shut 
up in a box for two days and brush out the pow- 
der. 

Soiled Gloves — To clean kid gloves when slightly 
soiled take a teaspoonful of powdered French 
chalk. Put the gloves on the hands and the chalk 
into the palm of one glove and rub the hand and 
fingers together as if washing your hands. Take 
off the gloves without shaking them and lay them 
aside for a night. Put them on and clap the hands 
or wipe the gloves with a clean cloth. Fuller's 
earth will do nearly as well. 

White kid gloves can be cleaned on the hands 
with oatmeal and benzine mixture to a paste. Con- 
tinue rubbing till the paste drops off in dry flakes. 

Yellow Gloves or Hose For gloves that have 

turned yellow or hose yellowed by the feet, or white 
hose that are stained, pour gasoline over till mois- 
tened, leave ten minutes, then wash in lukewarm 
water and plenty of white soap: rinse in cold water 
to which a teaspoonful of gasoline has been added. 

To Dye Gloves — White kid gloves can be dyed 
tan by dipping them in saffron water until the 
desired shade is obtained. 



Black Gloves Black kid or suede gloves that 

wear white at the ends, can be made to look like 
new; mix a little good black ink with 1^ teaspoon- 
ful of olive oil and apply to the faded parts with 
a feather. Let the gloves dry thoroughly before 
wearing them. 

To Wash Chamois Leather (Cornell Reading 
Course) — Apparatus: warm water and washing 
soda, soap, and a clean towel. 

Dissolve J/g cupful washing soda in 2 quarts of 
lukewarm water. 

Soak the chamois in the soda water 15 to 60 
minutes, according to dirtiness. 

Lift the chamois into a basin of warm, strong 
soapsuds, and squeeze and work them with the 
hands until clean. Be careful not to rub or wring 
them. Very soiled places may be put on a smooth 
surface and brushed with a small brush. 

Rinse thoroughly in warm, soft water. Press 
as much water out as possible by pulling through 
the hand. Roll in the towel and wring tightly. 
Stretch well in all directions and hang to dry. 

Stretch and rub the chamois two or three times 
while they are drying. 

Chamois Gloves White chamois gloves after be- 
ing washed are usually stiff, and it is difficult to 
get them on again. Let them become partially 
dry, then fit them on the hand, after which care- 
fully remove, keeping the gloves the shape of the 
hands; let them dry thus in the model of the hand. 

Wring chamois out of the soapy water without 
rinsing, and when it dries it is soft and serviceable 
instead of stiff.

THE LAUNDRY— MISCELLANEOUS 

Laundry Container — A wicker hamper is perhaps the ideal laundry con- 
tainer, but it must be kept clean. One enameled white looks so clean that it is hard 
to remember that it may harbor impurities and germs. It must be washed in hot 
water occasionally, and dried in the sunshine, and then further refreshed w^ith a 
clean coat of enamel. 

Laundry bags in the different rooms can be emptied every day into the 
hamper. These bags should be of a sort easily washed, and should be washed 
every couple of weeks. 

A big white enameled tin box is an admirable holder for laundry from a 
nursery or sick room. This should be emptied, scalded and aired every day — 
the laundry being put into boiling water or a disinfecting fluid. 



SOAP 



Soap (Cornell Reading Course "The Laun- 
dry") There is much difference of opinion as to 

which kind of lye produces the better soap. The 
question is settled "practically" in favor of sodium 
lye, for it can be produced at a smaller cost. It 
is safe to say that much of the soap on the market 
is made from sodium lye. 

When lye is mixed ^vith a fat it breaks the fat 
up into fatty acids and glycerin, of which it is com- 
posed. The lye unites with the fatty acids to form 
a new compound, called soap, and glycerin re- 
mains. This is the process of soap-making called 
saponification. The nature of the soap fornied will 
depend, first, on the nature of the fats used, 
whether they are hard or soft, clean or rancid; 
second, on the kind of alkali used, ^vhether potash 
lye or soda lye; third, on the nature and amount 
of impurities in both fat and alkali; fourth, on the 
completeness of the process of soap-making or sa- 
ponification. If the operation of soap-making is 
not properly conducted, the reaction between the 
fat and the lye is incomplete, and a soap is pro- 
duced that contains free fat and an undue amount 
of free alkali. Such soap is greasy, unduly active, 
and a poor cleansing agent. 

The Adulteration of Soap — It is not uncommon 
to find some foreign, insoluble substances in soap, 
which have been added merely to increase its 
weight and bulk. In cheap soaps resin is often 
added as an adulterant. It is rather difficult to say 
when resin may be considered an adulterant, for 
in small quantities it is of. value in laundry soaps 
because it whitens the clothing. Resin gives a 
brown color to soap, therefore a dark brown soap 
may be safely rejected as containing an excess of 
resin. 

The best advice to give the housekeeper is: Se- 
lect soap manufactured by a reliable firm and give 
it a trial. It is not economy to use a cheap, poorly 
made soap in the laundry. A common mistake 



is to think that the use of one kind of soap will 
prove satisfactory for all purposes; this common 
belief possibly accounts for much of the dissatis- 
faction that exists regarding the various soaps on 
the market. Every laundry should contain three 
grades of soap, mild, medium, strong. A mild soap 
should always be used in washing flannels, woolen 
goods, or fabrics either frail or delicate in color. 
A medium soap should be used for the more dur- 
able colored goods. A strong soap is best for most 
white goods, both cotton and linen. 

Soap Is Antiseptic — Aside from its use in remov- 
ing dirt, soap has antiseptic properties. It is not 
safe to depend on it as the only disinfectant in 
cases of contagious diseases, but it is a valuable 
purifier for the ordinary household washing. 

Home-Made Soap — A question often arises as 
to the advisability of using kitchen waste fats in 
making home-made soap. While some housekeep- 
ers may find such use an economy, the fact re- 
mains that home-made soaps are generally poorly 
made and of inferior quality. 

Washing Powders — Something should be said of 
washing powders. They are mixtures of soap and 
some alkali, such as lye, washing soda, and borax, 
and may have incorporated with them some one 
or more of the substances of the nature of turpen- 
tine, paraffin. Fuller's earth. In the case of the 
poorer powders a "filler" is used; that is, a sub- 
stance to give weight to the powder and very prop- 
erly considered an adulterant. The best powders 
contain large amounts of soap and only small 
amounts of alkali. A report is made, however, of 
one of the poorer varieties of washing powder con- 
taining only 1 per cent of soap. There may be 
occasions when washing powder is desirable, but 
ndiscriminate use of these strong cleansing agents 
s inadvisable and should not be generally indulged

SOAP FORMULAS AND SUBSTITUTES 



Home-Made Soap — ^Take I pound can lye dis- 
solved in 3 pints cold water, 5 pounds fat melted, 
I Yi tablespoonfuls borax and Yl cupful ammonia. 

When lye mixture has cooled add it to fat, stir 
until as thick as honey, pour into wooden or paste- 
board boxes lined with oiled or waxed paper, set 
away to harden. 

Soap Bark — One pound soap bark equals 2 
pounds soft soap. Use in place of soap. 

Bran ^Take I cupful bran, I quart water. Boil 

half hour. Strain, boil bran in a second quart of 
water Yl hour. When needed, reduce with warm 
water. 

Potato Water — Grate 2 large-sized potatoes into 
1 pint clean, clear, soft water. Strain into I gal- 
lon water, let liquid settle. Pour off and use. 

Soap Solution for Colored Goods — One-quarter 
pound mild or medium soap to 1 gallon of water. 

Soap Solution, Ordinary Purposes — One bar of 
ordinary washing soap, 2 to 3 quarts of water; 
shave soap and put into saucepan with cold water. 
Heat gradually until soap is dissolved (about I 
hour). 

Soap Solution for Soaking Clothes — One bar of 
ordinary soap, 3 gallons of water, Yl ^° ' table- 
spoonful turpentine, I to 3 tablespoonfuls ammonia. 

Soap Solution, Much Soiled Woolens and Deli- 
cate Colors — Half a pound of very mild or neutral 
soap, Ya pound borax, 3 quarts of water. 

Soap Jelly with Turpentine — One bar soap, 1 



quart water, I teaspoonful turpentine or kerosene. 

For Washing Delicate Fabrics and colors, a 
liquid may be made from laundry starch, grated 
potatoes, rice, flour, etc. The water in which rice 
has boiled may be saved and utilized for the same 
purpose. The cleansing liquid after cooking should 
be as thick as cream, and should be diluted from 
I to 4 times, according to the amount of dirt in 
the clothing. Rinse clothing in a more dilute solu- 
tion, which may be blued for white clothes. 

A Good Laundry Soap — Five pounds good, clean 
grease free from all water, 1 can potash or lye, Ya 
cupful kerosene, Ya cupful ammonia, 2 tablespoon- 
fuls powdered borax, 1 cents' worth oil of sassa- 
fras. Dissolve the potash in 5 cupfuls of cold 
water thoroughly; melt the grease and strain 
through an old stocking into the potash, stirring 
all the time, mixing the kerosene, ammonia and 
borax together, and then add the oil of sassafras. 
Have a deep pan lined with brown paper and pour 
in the soap; w^hen set mark off in squares and put 
away to harden. Will make 30 cakes. 

Soap Improves with keeping, so it should always 
be bought in large quantities. Before storing it, 
however, it is "well to cut the bars into convenient 
pieces, for this is most easily done when it is soft. 
The cutting may be done with a piece of string or 
wire n>ore easily than with a knife. 

Brown Soaps usually contain resin and soda 
and are injurious to colored clothes; resin is in- 
jurious to flannel and woolens; neither should be 
washed vrith such soap. 



STARCH, STARCH SUBSTITUTES, ACCESSORIES 



Starch, Substitutes, Accessories (Cornell Read- 
ing Course) — Directions for using: In making 
starch a naturally soft water is greatly to be de- 
sired, but if the water furnished is hard it should 
be softened with borax, not with washing soda or 
lye, since the latter tend to produce a yellow color 
with starch. 

One-quarter cupful wheat starch to t quart 
water gives flexible, light, durable starch. 

One-quarter cupful cornstarch to 1 quart water 
gives moderate body stiffness. 

One-half cupful wheat starch to I quart water 
gives flexible, firm finish. 

One-half cupful cornstarch to 1 quart water 
gives stiff body finish. 

A mixture of the two starches may be varied, 
to produce any desired result. 

Directions for Cooking Starch Starch should 

first be mixed with a little cold water and then 
stirred slowly into boiling water and cooked in 
accordance with the following directions: 

If wheat starch is used, cook slowly at least 25 
or 30 minutes. 



If cornstarch is used, cook slo^vly I 5 or 20 min- 
utes. 

If a mixture of wheat starch and cornstarch is 
used, the wheat starch should be added first and 
cooked ! 5 minutes. The cornstarch should then 
be added and the mixture cooked 1 5 minutes 
longer. Stir mixture frequently, to prevent stick- 
ing and formation of a skin. 

Thorough cooking of starch is very desirable in 
laundry practice, for it increases the penetrability 
of the starch and decreases its tendency to stick 
to the iron. If borax, lard, butter, kerosene, or 
other like substance is used it should be cooked 
with the starch, to insure thorough mixing. 

Thick Starch — One-half cupful starch, mixed 
with Yl cupful cold water, 1 quart boiling water, 
Yl to 1 level tablespoonful borax, Ya level table- 
spoonful lard or butter or kerosene or turpentine, 
or '/^-inch square wax or paraffin. Mix and cook 
as directed under directions for cooking starch. 

Thin Starch One-half cupful starch, mixed with 

Yl cupful cold water, 3 quarts boiling water; other

ingredients sar 
as directed. 



3s for thick starch; mix, cook 



Clear Starch — Dilute Yl cupful thick atarch with 
I quart hot ivater. 

Clear starch is used for thin muslins, infants* 
dresses, etc. 

Raw Starch — Same proportions as for thick 
starch; use borax, but omit fatty substances; stir 
thoroughly before using. 

Raw starch is often used with very thick or very 
thin goods, to increase their stiffness. A fabric 
will take up a greater amount of starch in the raw 
form than in the cooked form. The desired stiff- 
ness is produced by the cooking given the raw 
starch by the heat of the iron. The difficulty of 
ironing is increased by using raw starch, for unless 
the ironer is skillful the starch cooks on the iron 
and starch specks are then produced in the clothes. 
Moreover, raw starch gives a less durable finish 
than does cooked starch. 

Rice Starch — One-quarter cupful of rice and I 
quart boiling water. Wash rice, cook in water 
until very soft. As water evaporates, add more to 
keep quantity up to I quart. When cooked add 
another quart boiling water. Strain, without squeez- 
ing, through double thickness cheesecloth or 



through flannel. Use while hot. The most satis- 
factory starch for delicate fabrics is rice starch, 
and it may be used in place of clear starch. 

Glue (For Stiffening Dark Clothes — Twelve ounces 
dark glue, I quart water. Boil together until glue 
is dissolved, cool somewhat. Dip the garment to 
be stiffened into glue and wipe off excess of glue 
with piece of black cheesecloth, satuen or calico. 
After sprinkling roll garment in black cloth and 
iron on ironing board covered with black cloth. 
Any glue left over may be saved and used again. 

To Increase Stiffness — Partly dry garment be- 
fore starching. Add I tablespoonful powdered 
gum arabic reduced to liquid in Yi cupful boiling 
water, to the stiff starch mixture. Or use borax. 
Or add a small amount of glue to starch mixture. 
Dry quickly. 

Gum Arabic as a Starch Substitute — Four table- 
spoonfuls pulverized gum arabic, I pint cold water, 
3 tableapoonfuls alcohol. Put water and gum ara- 
bic in saucepan and set into saucepan containing 
boiling water. When dissolved strain through 
cheesecloth, cool, add alcohol, pour into a bottle, 
cork, set away for use. The alcohol acts as a pre- 
servative and the mixture may be kept for any 
length of time. 



BLUING AND MISCELLANIES 



Bluing (Cornell Reading Course) — White fab- 
rics have naturally a creamy tint, which may be 
deepened to an unpleasant pale yellow by careless 
washing, by insufficient rinsing, or by lack of ex- 
posure to the bleaching influence of sunlight and 
fresh air. Bluing is used to hide the yellow color, 
because blue and yellow are complementary col- 
ors, and when used together in proper proportions 
give the effect of whiteness. Bluing is unwarrant- 
ably used to hide a yellowness which comes from 
careless washing. 

No one kind of bluing may be recommended to 
the housekeeper. She must experiment for herself, 
choose one good variety, and learn to use that one 
properly. 

Sufficient bluing should be used to make a little 
of the bluing water taken up in the cup of the hand 
show a pale sky-blue color. More than that amount 
of bluing should not be needed. It is always best 
to make a small amount of strong bluing in a bowl 
of water, then draw from it to color the water in 
the tub. 

Blue To prevent blue from streaking clothes 

mix 1 dessert-spoonful of soda in the bluing ^vater. 

Marking Linen — To mark fine linen with indel- 
ible ink, without blurring or spreading, first starch 
and iron the goods smoothly. The writing may 
then be made small and neat and will remain clear- 
cut and distinct. 



To Hang Skirts — The right way — especially 
pique, cotton or woolen skirts — is to pin them to 
the line by the waistband so that they will hang 
straight down. If pinned at the top they will 
shrink evenly all around instead of sagging, as they 
too often do when pinned by the hem. 

Bleaching (Cornell Reading Course) — In former 
times, dependence was placed on sunshine, fresh 
air and a greensward for bleaching all manufac- 
tured cottons and linens. Such dependence on 
natural agents has been obviated by the ability to 
procure similar results from the use of chemicals. 

In the home laundry, we still use natural agents 
to whiten and purify household linen. That is the 
greatest advantage which the home laundry has 
over the commercial laundry; in the latter, in a 
majority of cases, clothes are dried in steam clos- 
ets, and some chemical must replace the sun's rays 
to bleach a garment left yellow by washing. The 
action of the sun and air is not merely to bleach 
but to disinfect, and clothes thus dried have a fresh- 
ness and sweetness that cannot be duplicated by 
any other method. 

Occasionally, even in the household, it may be 
necessary to supplement the natural bleaching 
process by the use of chemicals. If a garment has 
yellowed by age or by being packed away with 
starch in it, it may be expedient to use a chemical 
bleach. 



356 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Section VI— LAUNDRY, IRONING BOARD 



The best bleach to use is javelle water, which 
should be made as follows: 

Javelle Water One pound washing soda, Yl 

pound chlorid of lime, I quart boiling water, 2 
quarts cold water. Put soda in granite pan, add 
boiling water and stir until dissolved; let cool. 
Dissolve chlorid of lime in cold water; let settle and 
pour the clear liquid into the soda; let settle. Pour 
off clear liquid, bottle and put away in dark place. 

Use, mixed with equal parts or more of water, 
and do not let the garments stay in over '/2 hour. 
Rinse thoroughly in several waters, and lastly in 
dilute ammonia water. 

Moisture is necessary if clothes are to be 
bleached by the action of the sun. After a gar- 
ment dries, it should be made wet again and hung 
out. It may be necessary to repeat the wetting 
process a number of times before the yellow tinge 
fades and yields. It is said that clothes are whit- 
ened if they are allowed to freeze out of doors on 
the line. The reason given for the bleaching 
action is that freezing causes the clothes to retain 
moisture, hence the time of their bleaching is pro- 
longed. 



To Save Hands — A little vinegar placed in the 
rinsing water on washing day will prevent the 
hands from becoming rough and chapped. 

To Set Colors — Green, blue, lavender, aniline 
red, purple and pink should be soaked in alum 
water, 2 ounces to a tub. Black, gray and dark 
blue should soak in strong salted water. 

To Clean a Raincoat — Use soap and water and 
not gasoline, as the latter will injure the rubber 
in the fabric. Lay out on a flat surface and scrub 
lightly w^ith soap and water. Do not wring. Put 
on a coat-hanger and hang to dry. 

Shiny Skirt — Turpentine is a ready remedy for 
removing the shine from a dark skirt. Rub the 
affected parts with a small piece of flannel dipped 
in the turpentine and hang the garment in the open 
air to remove the odor of the turpentine. 

Paraffin in Starch — ^To secure smoothness and 
glossiness when ironing starched pieces stir the 
starch three or four times while boiling and just 
ready to remove with a paraffin candle.

THE IRONING BOARD 

Women are more and more sensible each generation about cutting down 
on unnecessary work; one of the first places of which this is true is the laundry. 
They do not iron everything, as their grandmothers did, perspiring over a hot stove 
all day. They have found that an hour or two in the early mornings of two days 
"pays better" w^hether done by themselves or by a maid ; and where they have elec- 
tricity they use the modern electric iron and take the work calmly and cool. 

Hosiery, knit underwear, rough towels, many other articles, and even 
sheets, may just as w^ell be laid aw^ay without the ironing process. By sensible 
hanging at the line, taking down as well as putting up, such garments may be left 
smooth enough for the nature of their use. If such pieces can be hung up without 
wringing, just a little of the w^ater squeezed or pressed out, they do not shrink so 
readily and are less likely to need the iron. Cotton crepes and other goods that are 
not to be ironed will look better if hung up dripping w^et. Crepe dresses and 
sweaters are best ironed by slipping over a coat-hanger to dry in shape. And many 
things besides lace curtains — including scrim and muslin curtains, by the way — are 
best dried on a curtain stretcher without ironing. 

Table linen, however, will bear no subterfuge. It must have a piping hot 
iron and the linen must be quite damp. 

With napkins, it is suggested that they all be ironed before folding, as it 
gives them a chance to thoroughly dry before folding, and saves time and labor ; but 
the final effect is not so perfect as if finished one at a time and folded as ironed, 
with the iron run over each fold as made. 

Linen and corded goods must never be ironed on the bias, as it will leave 
them out of shape. Iron lengthwise or crossways always. 

CORNELL COURSE ON IRONING 

Ironing (Cornell Reading Course) — While a knowledge of conditions aids greatly 
in ironing, as in other operations, experience and skill are necessary to accomplish good 
results. Ease of ironing and the quality of the product depend on the skill of the operator, or 
the care that has been used in starching, drying, folding and sprinkling the clothes to be 
ironed, and on the kind and condition of the irons. If the garments have been poorly and 
carelessly starched, the work of ironing is greatly increased. Starchy lumps cook on the 
iron and damage its smoothness, even when the lumps are immediately removed. The rea- 
son for allowing clothes to stand over night after sprinkling is to give them an even damp- 
ness that makes ironing easy and successful. If starched goods have been overdampened 
the starch is brought to the surface, and a result is produced similar to that of careless starch- 
ing. If linen is too dry it cannot be made smooth and free from wrinkles. If it is too wet 
the process of ironing is laborious. 

It is said that irons that are to be used for starched garments should not be polished 
by rubbing them on salt or emery paper. A better method is to procure a good yellow pine 
board, free from all sand and dirt, and rub it with a hot iron until a hard coat of burned 
resin is produced. The board may be used for polishing the iron. The iron should occasion- 
ally be wiped with a piece of wax or paraffin and then with a clean cloth. 

Have ready and at hand: a flat, firm, unwarped ironing board or table, tightly cov- 
ered with a blanket and clean sheet, securely fastened underneath; clean irons; an iron stand, 
which may well consist of a clean brick; two pieces of old cloth for cleaning irons; a piece of 



360 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Section VI— LAUNDRY, IRONING BOARD 

paper folded several times for testing irons; a piece of beeswax or paraffin tied in a cloth, 
for keeping irons smooth; a bowl of water and a clean cloth for moistening parts dried by 
exposure to air. Spread a large paper or place a blanket under the ironing board to receive 
the clothes while they are being ironed. 

For ordinary ironing a good, firm surface is desirable. A thin woolen blanket and 
an outside linen cover are sufficient. For embroideries or wool a thick covering is better, as 
the fabric should sink into a soft foundation to bring out the pattern in one case and to give 
a soft finish in the other. 

The following simple rules for ironing may be followed : 

Iron first that part of the garment which will be least mussed by further handling, 
or in which a little wrinkling will not seriously interfere with good results. 

If the garment is trimmed, iron laces and embroideries first, as they dry out quickly 
because of their porous nature. 

Leave as much of a garment folded as possible, to keep it moist. Sometimes it may 
be convenient to lay a piece of dampened cheesecloth over any unironed part to keep it 
moist. 

Silk Waists — Iron on wrong side while still damp. 

Embroideries — Iron on wrong side on soft foundation, to allow design to stand out. 

Laces — Lay on piece of flannel covered with a piece of cheesecloth. Iron on wrong 
side and pull out points with tip of iron. Lace should be stretched and pinned out on a hard 
surface. Pull out at each point and catch down with a pin; or stretch and roll on a bottle. 

Flannels — Iron after laying a dampened cheesecloth over them. If they are not 
covered with a damp cloth, iron on wrong side; have the iron only moderately hot. 

Colored Garments — Iron on wrong side, to prevent fading; do not have irons too 
hot. 

Silk Garments — Iron on wrong side, to prevent shininess. 

After Ironing each article should be hung on a frame or clotheshorse to dry and air 
before it is put away; if hung in a poorly ventilated room the clothes will have a bad odor. 

Sprinkling may not be necessary when an ironing machine is used for ironing, if the 
operator will remove the clothes from the line at the right time, that is, while they are still 
damp. The process can be carried through so quickly that it is unnecessary to keep one 
garment damp while the other is being ironed. 



IRONS AND OTHER UTENSILS 



Irons (Cornell Reading Course) — A number of 
irons are now on the market for summer use when 
it is not desirable to have sufficient fire in the 
range to heat the irons. Some of these are: elec- 
tric irons, gas irons, and, most practical of all for 
the country home, denatured-alcohol irons. 

For general laundry purposes one size of the 
ordinary sadiron is sufficient, but it is advisable to 
put several irons into a well-equipped laundry, to 
use for the various kinds of work to be done. 
Among them should be heavy, medium-heavy, and 
small pointed irons, the last for ironing ruffles, 
laces, etc. 

A frequent cause of poor ironing is the condi- 
tion of the irons. They must be kept clean and 
free from rust to do good work. New irons should 
be heated thoroughly and rubbed with wax or 
grease before using. If irons are to be put away 
for any length of time they should be covered with 



a thin coating of vaseline, clean grease or paraffin, 
or wrapped in wax paper. If starch cooks on, it 
should be removed immediately with a dull knife. 
If irons become dirty from careless use, or from 
being left on the stove during the preparation of 
the meals, they should be thoroughly washed with 
soap and water and carefully dried. To keep irons 
sniooth when using them, rub with wax or paraffin 
and wipe immediately with a clean cloth. They 
improve with wear if they have good treatment. 

Tubs Stationary tubs are best, even though 

running water is not available, for some simple 
method of draining them can always be devised. 
They are better if made of porcelain, enameled 
iron, or alberine stone. Wooden tubs may be 
more cheaply constructed, but there is danger of 
the wooden tub becoming unsanitary from careless 
handling. 



LAUNDRY, IRONING BOARD— MATERIALS

Stationary tubs should be always set with regard 
to the height of the person who is to use them 
most. Many tubs are set far too low, and neces- 
sitate too much back bending on the part of the 
operator. 

Laundry Bench — The laundry bench for holding 
tubs should be of the proper height; they are usu- 
ally set too low. 

Wringer A wringer should be a part of the 

laundry equipment, and the best on the market is 
usually the cheapest. After using a wringer, it 
should be carefully dried, and the screws pressing 
the rollers should be loosened. When not in use 
it should be kept covered with a cloth to protect it 
from dust and dirt. The bearings should be oiled 
occasionally. Oil dissolves rubber, and that prop- 
erty is taken advantage of in cleaning the rubber 
rollers; they are carefully wiped with a little kero- 
sene. The operation should not be performed 
frequently, however, and the oil should be care- 
fully and completely removed immediately after 
use. 

Ironing Board — The blanket and sheet should be 
put on tightly and smoothly and tacked securely 
under the board, using short brass-headed tacks. 
It is v^ell to have a separate blanket and sheet also, 
which fit the table used in the laundry, as a table 
is a convenient place for ironing large pieces. The 
ironing sheet should be kept clean. 

Sleeve Board A sleeve board is good not only 

for sleeves but for gathers and for small dresses. 
It is not difficult to manufacture at home. 

Attach to the Wall the broader end of the iron- 
ing board, with hinges; it is a great convenience, for 
then it is always in place, and can be put out of 
the way by folding up against the wall. 

Ragged Articles — If an article is ragged, fold it 
with the tear visible, not hid. You may be saved 
the embarrassment of taking it out for use thinking 
it whole, and only learning later when it is opened 
"in company.*' The man of the house vfill par- 
ticularly endorse this "pointer" if applied to his 
handkerchiefs. 

Buttons and Mending — While ironing, notice 
pieces needing repairs or buttons; place them on 
one side to go to the mending basket before put 
a^vay. 

Ironing Board Covers that are strong, durable 
and easily removed for laundering, are made of 



drilling and laced up the back with tape run 
through small rings or eyelets. 

An Ironing Pad is a great convenience when 
ironing lace waists, embroidery, dresses, etc. Make 
one of a piece of an old blanket folded several 
times with two layers of cotton batting in the 
centre; quilt it in one or two-inch blocks; make 
cases for it from old sheets. It is invaluable for 
use in sleeves, shoulder seams, and for doing up 
embroidery pieces, especially raised work. 

To Remove Wrinkles — Let a wrinkled garment 
hang 24 hours, if possible, before dressing it. Many 
of the wrinkles will hang out. Taffeta is really 
injured by each pressing, and although taffeta does 
wrinkle easily, some of the wrinkles will come out 
if the garment is smoothed and carefully hung 
away. After each pressing, too, taffeta is just so 
much more liable to ^vrinkle. 

When Chiffon is badly wrinkled, steam it, then 
hang it on a padded hanger. Stuff it with tissue 
paper, and dry it in front of fire or radiator. To 
steam it fill a big pan full of boiling water and hold 
the chiffon over it until it is damp with steam. 

Baby Irons — A set of toy irons is very useful for 
ironing baby clothes, or for yokes, sleeves and 
other dainty work. 

Rusty Irons To remove' rust from (latirons, 

saturate a piece of flannel with ammonia, then rub 
the irons. Dry with a cloth sprinkled with pow- 
dered bath brick. 

Rusty irons can be made beautifully smooth by 
rubbing them ^vhen hot upon a piece of beeswax 
tied in a cloth and then upon a cloth sprinkled with 
salt. 

Rub flatirons over waxed paper before setting 
them away and they will keep bright and smooth. 

Sticky Irons — Irons that have been put away 
sticky should be well scraped with a thin knife, 
then rubbed v^ith a rough cloth, moistened in kero- 
sene. 

If a Brick Is Used for an iron-stand the iron will 
hold its heat much longer than when an ordinary 
stand is used. 

Used Starch It is economical after using a bowl 

of old starch to let it settle. Then pour off the 
water and dry the starch in the oven at night. It 
will be reduced to a cake and can be used again. 

Water in which macaroni has been cooked will 
make an excellent starch for use for dainty lingerie 
garments or fine ginghams.

ALL KINDS OF STAINS 

First Aid — It is hardly necessary to say that stains should be treated as 
speedily as possible after their first appearance. When once dry they are more 
difficult to remove, requiring both time and perseverance. 

Paint should be instantly wiped off. Grease on wood, stone or carpet 
should be congealed before it has time to penetrate, by throwing cold water over 
it. Tea, coffee, ink, w^ine and fruit stains will disappear in a quarter of the time if 
they can be attended to w^hile wet. Spots on colored material must not be rubbed 
but dabbed over and over again until they disappear. Rubbing roughens the sur- 
face and often leaves a whitened circle almost as unsightly as the actual stain. The 
dabbing is best done by covering a finger with an old handkerchief frequently 
changed, and great care should be taken to confine the operation to the area of the 
stain itself, and not to extend the damage by dampening and dabbing the sur- 
rounding material. In the treatment of stains, to know what you mean to do, and 
to do it quietly and neatly, is more than half the battle. 

In General — When any greasy substance has been dropped upon silk, it can be 
abstracted by mixirg French chalk with methylated spirit to the consistency of cream, lay- 
ing it upon the stain, then covering with a brow^n paper and pressing with a warm iron. 
An ice cream mark can be removed by this means, but it must be applied at once. 

A bottle of cologne is a most useful article, for it will take away smears if rubbed 
on as soon as they appear, and it does not leave the disagreeable odor which remains for 
a time after using alcohol, benzine, and the like. Cologne may be used alike on white or 
colored fabrics, cotton or woolen, without the slightest injury. It is not intended for a gen- 
eral cleansing agent, as it is expensive for the purpose, but it is an emergency agent of about 
the same excellent value as others. For instance, when a person is quite ready to go out 
and detects some soil that has been overlooked ■when putting the garment, that is to be 
worn, away, a cloth saturated with cologne will remedy the spot at least temporarily, and 
leave a pleasant odor instead of the reverse. 

Medicine stains may often be removed by sponging thoroughly with alcohol. 

For acids, tie up a bit of washing soda in the stained part, make a lather of soap 
and cold soft water, immerse the linen and boil until the spot disappears.

GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF STAIN REMOVAL 

(Fronr U. S. Farmers' Bulletin No. 861) 

Prepared Under the Direction of 
C. F. Lang^orthy, Chief, Office of Home Economics 

The removal of stains is a necessary feature of the laundering and general 
care of clothing and other household textiles. Most stains may be removed easily 
at home, provided reliable methods are known and a few simple precautions are 
taken. With some stains prompt home treatment is necessary in order to save the 
article in question from being ruined, and in most cases it is desirable, since all 
stains are removed more easily when fresh. 

Too much emphasis cannot be laid on the importance of applying the stain 
removers w^hile the stain is still fresh, for usually it is much more difficult to re- 
move an old stain than a fresh one. Changes in the character of the stain, brought 
about by drying, exposure to air, washing, ironing or in other ways, often make it 
necessary to use chemicals in removing old stains, w^hereas in many cases much 
simpler methods are successful if the stc ins are treated when fresh. 



NATURE OF STAINS 



The nature of a stain should be known, if pos- 
sible, before its removal is attempted, since this 
determines the treatment to be adopted. More- 
over, if an unsuitable stain remover is used, the 
stain may be "set" so that its removal becomes 
difficult or even impossible. For example, if hot 
water, ■which easily removes most fresh fruit stains, 
is applied to stains containing protein, such as 
stains of milk, blood, eggs, or meat juice, it coagu- 
lates the albumin in the fibers of the cloth and 
makes it extremely difficult to remove. Similarly, 
soap, which aids in the removal of grease spots, 
sets many fruit stains. 

The kind of fabric upon which the stain occurs 
also should be known. The method of treatment 
adopted depends as much upon the nature, color, 
weave, finish, and weight of the fabric as upon the 
kind of stain. Cotton and linen are destroyed by 
strong acids and attacked to some extent even 
by weaker ones. Concentrated acids, therefore, 
should never be used in removing stains from these 
fabrics, and when dilute acids are used they should 
be neutralized afterwards with a suitable alkali or 
removed by thorough rinsing; otherwise the acid 
may become cencentrated on drying and destroy 
the fibers. Generally speaking, alkalis do not at- 
tack cotton or linen fabrics to the extent that acids 
do. However, long-continued or repeated expo- 
sure to alkalis, especially in hot solution, weakens 
the fibers. This fact is said to be due to a hydra- 
tion of the cellulose which constitutes the fibers. 
The damage to fabrics resulting from the careless 
use of strongly alkaline soaps, washing powders, 
washing soda, or lye, is well known to the house- 
keeper. 



Wool and silk, being more delicate than cotton 
and linen, require more careful treatment. The 
use of very hot water must be avoided, since it 
turns both wool and silk yellow, shrinks wool, and 
weakens silk and injures its finish. These ma- 
terials also will not stand much rubbing, as this 
felts together the wool fibers and results in a 
shrinkage or thickening of the material, while the 
silk fabrics, as a rule, are too delicate to stand 
much rubbing without breaking or separating the 
fibers. Both wool and silk are dissolved by strong 
alkalis and are injured even by washing soda or 
strongly alkaline soap. The only alkalis which 
should be used in laundering or removing stains 
from wool and silk are the milder ones like borax 
or dilute solutions of ammonia. Acids, with the 
exception of nitric which weakens and turns the 
fibers yellow, do not attack wool and silk readily. 

In general it is more difficult to remove stains 
from wool and silk than from cotton or linen. In 
removing stains from materials made from two 
or more kinds of fibers, such as silk and cotton 
mixtures, the effects of the stain removers upon 
all of the fibers should be considered. No chem- 
ical should be used which would injure the most 
delicate of the fibers present. 

It is also much more difficult to remove stains 
from colored than from white materials, for the 
reason that most of the bleaching agents which 
must be used to remove persistent stains are likely 
to destroy the color of the material as well.

METHODS FOR TREATMENT OF STAINS IN GENERAL 



The following paragraphs deal with methods 
and reagents commonly used in the removal of a 
number of stains. To save repetition, these are 
given here in detail, and reference is made to them 
in dealing with the particular stains in later pages 
of the bulletin. 

Laundering — Ordinary laundering, mentioned 
frequently as a method for removing stains, should 
be done as follows: First, soak the stained portion 
in cold or lukewarm water, rubbing the stain with 
a neutral soap if necessary. Follow this by thor- 
ough rinsing in clean water, after which the article 
may be laundered as usual. Use this method only 
for cotton and linen (white or fast colors) and the 
so-called wash silks and washable woolens. If the 
materials are delicate, sponge them. 

Sponging Sponging is applicable to all fabrics, 

but especially to delicate materials or colors which 
ordinary laundering might injure. Spread the 
stained article on a flat surface in a good light, 
and beneath the stain put a cloth folded into sev- 
eral thicknesses, or clean, white blotting paper, to 
absorb the superfluous liquid. Change the pad for 
a fresh one as soon as it becomes soiled. Sponge 
with a clean, soft lintless cloth (preferably of the 
same material as that stained) and renew it as fre- 
quently as may be necessary. Lay the stained 
material with the wrong side up and apply the 
water to the back, so that the foreign substances 
can be washed from the fibers onto the pad without 
having to pass through the material. 

Application of Chemicals Chemicals should not 

be used until water or laundering has been tried, 
for they attack the fibers of the cloth as well as 
the stain. 

There are a few common chemicals which are 
necessary in removing some stains, and these 
should be kept in every household. A good plan 
is to have a small cupboard in the laundry where 
these chemicals may be kept together with the 
utensils used in applying them. As some of these 
chemicals are poisonous they should not be kept 
in the family medicine cabinet or pantry. Chem- 
icals most commonly used in removing stains are 
Javelle water, potassium permanganate (solution), 
oxalic acid, ammonia water, carbon tetrachlorid, 
French chalk, and cream of tartar. 

With these chemicals should be kept some of the 
utensils used in applying them; such as a medium- 
sized bowl, a medicine dropper, a glass rod with 
rounded ends, several pads of cheesecloth or old 
muslin, and a small sponge. 

Other chemicals are mentioned in later pages of 
the bulletin. These can generally be bought as 
needed at any of the larger drug stores. 

If the effect of the stain remover upon the fiber 
or color is not known, try it by applying a little 



to a sample or to an unexposed portion of the 
goods. Sometimes it is best to remove the stain 
even if some of the color is removed also, for the 
color often may be restored by careful tinting. 

Work rapidly when using chemicals to remove 
stains, so as to give them as little time as possible 
to act on the textile fibers. Many brief applica- 
tions of the chemicals, with rinsing or neutraliza- 
tion after each application, are preferable to the 
practice of allowing them to remain on the stain 
for a long time. Stretch the stained portion of the 
garment over a bowl of clean water and apply the 
chemical with a medicine dropper. The chemicals 
may be rinsed out quickly by dipping in the clean 
water. Another method is to place the stained 
portion over a pad of folded cloth and apply the 
chemical with a glass rod. The rinsing or neutrali- 
zing always must be thorough. 

Javelle Water — Prepare Javelle water as follows: 
Dissolve I pound of washing soda in I quart of 
cold water To this solution add Y^ pound of or- 
dinary bleaching powder (calcium hypochlorite). 
Filter this liquid through a piece of muslin to re- 
move the sediment which remains. Keep the clear 
liquid in tightly stoppered bottles for use. Javelle 
water may be used successfully in removing a num- 
ber of stains, but should be applied only to un- 
colored cotton or linen materials, since it bleaches 
colors and rots silk or wool. In treating stains 
with Javelle water, stretch the stained portion over 
a bowl filled with water and apply the Javelle water 
to the stain with a medicine dropper. Do not allow 
the Javelle water to remain in contact with the 
stain for more than one minute, and then apply 
oxalic-acid solution to neutralize the Javelle water 
and rinse by dipping the stain in the bowl of 
water. 

Commercial ink removers are similar in action 
to Javelle water, and are very convenient for re- 
moving many stains beside ink spots. 

If allowed to remain too long in contact with the 
fibers Javelle water rots even linen and cotton ma- 
terials, and it should, therefore, always be neutral- 
ized with oxalic acid and the fabric be rinsed thor- 
oughly to remove all traces of the chemical. Sev- 
eral applications of the Javelle water with inter- 
mediate neutralizations are necessary with persis- 
tent stains. 

Potassium Permanganate — Potassium perman- 
ganate can be used in removing stains from all 
white fabrics. It also may be used successfully 
upon many colored materials, but should always 
be tried first on an unexposed portion of the goods, 
to determine its effect on the dye. It does not 
harm delicate fibers, provided it is used vrith rea- 
sonable care. First, remove as much of the stain 
as possible by sponging or washing with 
cold water. Prepare and use the perman- 



366 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Section VI— LAUNDRY, IRONING BOARD 



ganate as follows: Dissolve I teaspoonful of the 
crystals in a pint of water and apply a little of this 
to the stain with a medicine dropper, a glass rod, 
or a clean cork, and allow it to remain for about 
five minutes. Remove any pink or brow^n stain left 
by the permanganate, by applying one of the fol- 
lowing chemicals: 

1 . Hydrogen peroxid, made slightly acid (if not 
already so) with hydrochloric, acetic, oxalic, or 
tartaric acid. One drop of the acid usually is 
enough to acidify 3 teaspoonfuls of the peroxid. 

2. Oxalic acid in saturated solution or lemon 
juice for cotton, linen, or silk. Hydrogen peroxid 
is more satisfactory for wool. 

Follovir the treatment by thorough rinsing. 
One or more repetitions of this treatment may 
be necessary in the case of persistent stains. 

Oxalic Acid — ^This is poisonous and should be 
used carefully; the bottle in which it is kept must 
be marked "Poison," and kept out of the reach of 
children. 



METHODS FOR INDIVIDUAL STAINS 



In cases where the nature of the stain is not 
known it should be attacked first by sponging with 
cold water, provided, however, that the fabric 
would not be injured by water. If the stain is not 
removed by cold or warm water, chemicals should 
then be applied. Often the behavior of a stain, 
when treated with cold water, will give some indi- 
cation of its nature; for example, a grease spot will 
not absorb water. Hot water should be avoided in 
treating unknown stains until after other sub- 
stances have been tried, since hot water will set 
many stains and make their removal more difficult. 

Acids — With the exception of nitric acid, acids 
do not generally produce stains upon white fabrics 
but often change or destroy the color of dyed ma- 
terials. However, vegetable fibers are destroyed 
readily by some acids, especially by those of greater 
concentration or strength. Strong sulphuric acid, 
by virtue of its drying action, readily destroys the 
fibers of cotton and linen, which consist chiefly of 
cellulose; but not those of wool and silk, which do 
not contain cellulose. Strong nitric acid or the 
dilute acid, if allowed to become concentrated by 
drying not only turns the fibers of silk and wool 
to a permanent bright yellow, but finally dissolves 
them. Dilute acids do not attack the fibers to any 
great extent unless they are allowed to dry on the 
cloth and become concentrated, but they do some- 
times affect the color of the fibers. It is essential, 
therefore, that acid spots on textiles be neutralized 
at once by some alkaline solution. For this pur- 
pose anyone of the following should give good 
results: 

1. Water. Rinse the spot several times in a 
large volume of water. This treatment serves to 



stop any further action of the acid on the fabric, 
but usually has no effect upon any discoloration 
due to the acid. 

2. An alkaline substance. Apply an alkali to 
the acid spot. The alkali forms a salt with the acid 
and this must be removed later by rinsing or 
sponging with water. The acid should be neutral- 
ized completely with the alkali or the discoloration 
may reappear after awhile. To determine when an 
acid is completely neutralized touch it vfith a piece 
of litmus paper, w^et in clean water. Litmus paper 
is red in the presence of acids and blue vtrith alkalis. 
It may be purchased at some drug stores, but if 
litmus paper is not available it is possible to tell 
when an acid spot is neutralized by tasting it. If 
alkaline it will taste bitter and if acid it will taste 
sour. Any of the following alkalis may be used. 

(a) Ammonia. If the spot is slight, neutralize 
it by holding it in the fumes from an open bottle 
of strong ammonia. 

(b) Sodium bicarbonate (baking soda). Sprinkle 
this on the stain — on both sides, if possible — 
moisten with vi^ater, and allow to stand until the 
acid is neutralized (shov^n in this case by the ceas- 
ing of the effervescence) ; and remove the excess 
by rinsing with water. 

(c) Ammonium carbonate (sal volatile). Apply 
in the same way as sodium bicarbonate. 

Alkalis Dilute alkalis have little effect on cotton 

and linen, but strong alkalis cause the fibers to 
sv^ell and become yellow, and the cloth to contract. 
The fiber, however, is not weakened unless the 
alkali is allowed to remain a long time upon the 
cloth or to become very concentrated through 
evaporation. Wool and silk, on the other hand. 



To prepare a solution of oxalic acid for use, dis- 
solve as many of the crystals of the acid as will 
dissolve in a pint of lukewarm water. Put into a 
bottle, stopper tightly, and use as needed. Apply 
this solution to the stain with a medicine dropper 
or glass rod, and after allowing it to remain for a 
few minutes rinse thoroughly in clean wrater. 

Hydrogen Peroxid — Hydrogen peroxid, as ob- 
tained for medicinal purposes, usually is made 
slightly acid, to give it better keeping quality. For 
use in removing stains make a small amount of the 
peroxid slightly alkaline with ammonia. It then 
decomposes easily and its oxygen is free to attack 
the stain. Since hydrogen peroxid affects the fiber 
also, in the case of cotton and linen materials, fol- 
low it by very careful rinsing. Apply it to the 
stain with a medicine dropper, a glass rod, or a 
clean cork, or sponge the stain v^rith it. The 
method of using it in neutralizing potassium 
permanganate is described above.

are yellowed or destroyed by strong alkalis even in 
dilute solutions. Even if the fiber is not affected 
by the alkali, the color may be changed or de- 
stroyed. It is important, therefore, to neutralize 
alkali spots at once. Use any of the following 
agents: 

1 . Water. Rinse thoroughly. Frequently this 
is sufficient in the case of such alkalis as washing 
soda and ammonia. 

2. A mild acid. Apply the acid with a cloth 
until the fabric changes back to its original color, 
or until the stain is slightly acid as shown by its 
reaction to litmus paper or by the odor or taste. 
Then rinse the fabric thoroughly in water. In the 
case of colored goods it is helpful to rub the stain 



dry, using a piece of the same material as the 
stained fabric, if possible. Use any of the follow- 
ing mild acids: 

(a) Lemon juice. Squeeze the juice on the 
stain. As long as the spot remains alkaline the 
juice is a bright yellow in color, but when the spot 
becomes acid the color disappears almost entirely. 
Apply the lemon juice until this color change takes 
place. 

(b) Vinegar. If the vinegar itself leaves a spot, 
remove it by sponging with water. 

(c) Acetic acid. Apply a 10 per cent, solution 
to the stain and remove the excess by rinsing.

Course, Farm House Series No. 3, "The Laundry," to which the publishers acknowledge 
their grateful indebtedness. Such Cornell items are in each case marked "(C. R. C.)." 



Blood — (C. R. C.) — Wash in cold water until 
stain turns brown, then rub with naptha soap and 
soak in warm water. Or; rub with common soap, 
then soak in water to which a teaspoon of turpen- 
tine has been added. Or; if the goods is thick 
apply a paste of raw starch to the stain; renew 
paste from time to time until stain disappears. 

Blood — If fresh, blood may be removed by soak- 
ing for twelve hours in cold water and starch; or 
by soaking in cold water, then washing in warm 
water with plenty of soap; expose to the sun a day 
or two if any stain remains. Old blood stains re- 
quire iodine of potassium diluted with four times 
its weight of water. 

Chocolate (C. R. C.) — Sprinkle with borax 

and soak in cold water. 

Chocolate and Coffee Pour soft boiling water 

through the stains and while wet hold in the fumes 
of burning sulphur. Or soak overnight in cold 
water in which a little borax has been dissolved. 
Or use glycerine in same manner as for tea stains 
(see TEA), especially when cream had been in 
the coffee or the chocolate. 

Coffee (C. R. C.) Spread stained surface of 

the cloth over bowl or tub. Pour boiling water 
through the stained part of the cloth; pour from a 
height so as to strike the stain with force. 

Cream — (C. R. C.) — Wash in cold water, then 
with soap and water. 

Fruit and Wine — (C. R. C.) — Treat with boiling 
water as for coffee. If the stain resists the 
boiling water treatment, soak the stained part 
of the cloth for a few minutes in a solution made 
from equal parts of javelle water and boiling water. 
Rinse thoroughly with boiling water to which a 
little dilute ammonia water has been added. Re- 
peat if necessary. 



Fruit and Wine — While fresh, gently rub the 
spot with a clean cloth saturated with alcohol; if 
cloth remains on the table, protect the table from 
the alcohol. If old, rub fruit stains with yellow 
soap on both sides of the cloth, cover quickly with 
cold water starch well rubbed in, and expose to 
sun and air for three or four days. Then rub off 
the mixture. Repeat process if necessary. Apple 
and pear stains may be removed by soaking in 
paraffin for a few hours before washing. Fruit 
spots may often be removed by pouring boiling 
water through the stain while fresh. Old fixed 
stains may be removed by soaking in a weak solu- 
tion of oxalic acid, or holding the spot over the 
fumes of sulphur. 

Egg — Egg stains should be soaked in cold water; 
hot water would set the stains. The same rule 
applies to egg stains on dishes; wash in cold water 
instead of hot water and they come off more read- 

ily- 

Grass Stains — (C. R. C.) — Soak in alcohol. Or; 
Wash with naptha soap and warm water. If the 
fabric has no delicate colors and the stain is fresh, 
treat with ammonia water. For colored fabrics, 
apply molasses or a paste of soap and cooking 
soda and let stand over night. 

Grease Spots — (C. R. C.) — wash thoroughly with 
naptha soap and water. Soften old grease spots 
with turpentine, oil, or lard, before washing the 
cloth. Or; dissolve the grease in benzine, alcohol, 
chloroform, ether, carbona, or benzol. For deli- 
cate fabrics dissolve grease spots in ether or chloro- 
form. Chloroform and carbona are useful because 
non-inflammable. Or; apply a paste of Fuller's 
earth or chalk to absorb grease, especially when 
fresh. 



368 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Section VI— LAUNDRY, IRONING BOARD 



Grease — Hot water and soap will usually remove 
these; if of long standing use chloroform or naptha 
(away from artificial open Hame light). Eucalyp- 
tus oil (used for mosquito lotion, but not always 
unadulterated for this purpose) will remove grease 
spots without injury to any material. 

Indigo — (C. R. C. ) — Treat as for coffee (C. R. 
C). 

Ink — (C. R. C.) — Ink is often difficult to re- 
move, as it varies greatly in composition. It is 
well to experiment with a corner of the spot (or 
with some of the same ink on another fabric) be- 
fore operating on the whole. 

If the stain is fresh, soak the stained portion of 
the cloth in milk. Use fresh milk as the old be- 
comes discolored. Or; wet the stain with cold 
water. Apply a ten per cent, solution of oxalic 
acid to stain, let stand a few minutes, and rinse. 
Repeat until stain disappears. Rinse in water to 
^vhich borax or ammonia has been added. (Oxalic 
acid is a very poisonous substance). Javelle water 
wll remove some ink stains. Apply as for rust 
stains (see RUST (C. R. C). Or; treat with 
hydrochloric acid as for iron rust (C. R. C). Or; 
treat with lemon juice and salt, as for iron rust 
(C. R. C. ). Or; use alcohol for some ink stains. 

Milk is the only reagent given above that does 
not remove color. 

Ink — (Iowa State College) — 1. If stain is fresh, 
place stained portion in sweet or sour milk and 
allow to stand several hours. 2. Wet stain in cold 
w^ater and drop dilute oxalic acid or equal parts 
oxalic acid and cream of tartar on the spot, let 
stand a few minutes and rinse in ammonia water. 
3. If stain is dry and well set, cover with salt and 
lemon juice, or use Javelle water. 4. Soak stain in 
hot vinegar. 5. Ink eradicator may be used. The 
result depends upon weave and material, also kind 
of ink. 

To bleach or remove stains from white goods, 
soak the article in equal quantities Javelle water 
and hot water until stains disappear; then rinse 
thoroughly in several waters, and finally in diluted 
am.monia water. 

Javelle water removes all stains and all colors, 
and therefore should not be used on colored goods. 

Ink — Ink can generally be removed in the same 
manner as rust. Oxalic acid and Javelle water 
will remove ink, but all ink removers except milk 
will also remove color from colored fabrics. Soak 
in sour milk; if a stain remains and the fabric is 
not a colored fabric; rinse in a weak solution of 
chlorid of lime, or try other reagents. To take 
ink spots out of colored materials cover with tal- 
low before sending to the laundry and much if not 
all of the stain will disappear. Boiling starch 
poured over ink spots will often remove ink spots, 
but requires treatment for an hour or two; it is 
not injurious to colored materials. Salts of lemon 
will remove ink spots in many cases; wet the 



powder, then wet the spot with tepid w&ter; then 
rub on a little of the salts and expose to the sun. 
Use of milk: wash out as much of the spot as pos- 
sible in milk; put finally to soak in a pan of milk, 
let it stand two days, or until the milk turns to 
clabber; then wash out the fabric. 

Indellible Ink — Cyanide of potassium (one of 
the most violent of poisons) will remove all in- 
dellible inks, the base of which is nitrate of silver. 
Turpentine or alcohol rubbed in hot removes the 
new inks, using soda and soap freely in hot water 
afterwards. 

Iodine — (C. R. C.) — Soak in alcohol, chloro- 
form or ether. 

Iodine — Iodine may be removed from skin or 
clothing with strong ammonia water. Or use boil- 
ing starch water same as for ink stains. Or wash 
with alcohol, then rinse with soapy water. 

Iron Rust — (C. R. C.) — 1. Wet the stained part 
with borax and vrater, or ammonia, and spread 
over a bowl of boiling water. Aply a ten per 
cent, solution of hydrochloric acid, drop by drop, 
until the stain begins to brighten. Dip at once 
into alkiline water. If the stain does not at once 
disappear add more acid and rinse again. After 
the stain is removed, rinse at once thoroughly in 
water to which borax or ammonia has been added, 
to neutralize any acid that may linger. Less dilute 
acid may be used if the operator is skillful. 

2. Proceed as with hydrochloric acid, but use 
a ten per cent, solution of oxalic acid instead of 
hydrochloric acid. Oxalic acid is not so detri- 
mental to fabrics as is hydrochloric acid, but it is 
a deadly poison even in dilute solution. 

3. Wet the stained part ^vith a paste made of 
lemon juice, salt, starch and soap, and expose it 
to the sunlight. This is a simple method to em- 
ploy, but it takes longer and is often not effective. 

4. Soak stain in Javelle water for a few min- 
utes, then wash. Repeat until stain disappears. 
Javelle water is v»reaker in action than is hydro- 
chloric acid. All the iron-rust-removing substances 
destroy color, and unless care is taken will greatly 
weaken the fabric. 

Lampblack — (C. R. C.) — Saturate spot with 
kerosene. Wash with naphtha soap and water. 



Lampblack or Soot — Rub the spots with dry 
corn meal before sending the clothes to the laun- 
dry. 

Machine Oil — (C. R. C.) — Wash with soap and 
cold water. If the stain does not respond to 
the soap and water, use turpentine as directed 
(C. R. C.) for paint stains. 

Machine Oil — Try rubbing with lard, let stand, 
wash with cold water and soap. 

Meat Juice — (C. R. C.) — Wash in cold water, 
then with soap and water.

Medicine Stains — (C. R. C.) — Soak in alcohol. 

Mildew — (C. R. C.) — Mildew is very difficult to 
remove if of long standing. I. Wet stains with 
lemon juice and expose to the sun. 2. Wet with 
paste made of I tablespoonful of starch, juice of 
I lemon, soft soap, and salt, and expose to action 
of sun. 3. Treat with paste made of powdered 
chalk and expose to action of sun. 

Mildew — Mildew may often be removed with 
chlorid of lime; soak several hours, then rinse in 
cold water. Or try saturating the article with kero- 
sene, roll it up and let stand 24 hours, then wash 
in soapsuds. A mixture of soapy starch and milk 
will often prove sufficient for fresh mildew. 

Milk (C. R. C.) Treat as directed under 

cream. 

Mucus (C. R. C.) — Soak in ammonia water or 

in salt and water, then wash with soap and cold 
water. 

Mud Spots — Mud spots which are left after the 
garment has been brushed may be removed by rub- 
bing with a cut raw potato. 

Paint — (C. R. C.) — I. Wet the spot with turpen- 
tine, benzine or alcohol, let it stand a few minutes. 
Wet again and sponge or pat with a clean cloth. 
Continue until stain disappears. 2. For delicate 
colors, treat >vith chloroform. 3. If the paint is 
old it may take some time to soften. Treat old 
paint stains with equal parts of ammonia and tur- 
pentine. 

Paint — If a fine fabric is involved, use alcohol 
or chloroform instead of turpentine. If turpen- 
tine, when used, leaves a dark ring or spot, sponge 
with chloroform. 

Perspiration — (C. R. C.) — Wash in soapsuds and 
expose to the action of sunshine. Or treat with 
Javelle water as directed for iron rust. Or treat 
with oxalic acid as directed for iron rust. 

Scorch (C. R. C.) Scorched fabric can be re- 
stored if the threads are uninjured. 1. Wet the 
stained portion and expose to the action of the 
sun. Repeat several times. 2. Extract juice of 2 
onions, add I cupful vinegar, 2 ounces Fuller's 



earth, and Yi ounce of soap. Boil. Spread paste 
over scorched surface. Let it dry in sun. Wash 
out thoroughly. 

Scorch — Rub the spot with a cloth dipped in 
diluted peroxide of hydrogen; place the garment in 
the hottest sun possible. Or a soap rub, then the 
sun bath, n>ay be sufficient. 

Soot Treat as directed for lampblack. 

Stove Polish — (C. R. C.) — If fresh, remove by 
washing. If the stain is old, treat as directed for 
tar and lampblack. 

Tar — (C. R. C.) — Treat as directed for lamp- 
black. 

Tar or Pitch (or Wheel Grease) — Soften stains 
with lard, then soak in turpentine and rub gently 
until dry. Make a ring around the stained part, of 
cornstarch, so the turpentine will not spread. 

Tea (C. R. C.) Treat as directed for choco- 
late. Or soak the stain in glycerin, then wash. 

Tea Soak the stained part in cold water, then 

in glycerin, let it stand an hour or two, then wash 
with cold water and rub well. Even the old stains 
will disappear under this treatment. Directly tea 
is spilt on a table cloth or napkin, cover the stain 
with common salt. Leave it for awhile; when the 
cloth is then washed the stain will have disap- 
peared. Clear boiling water poured through tea 
stains, as directed for removing coffee stains, will 
effect removal. 

Tea stains on Granite Ware or enamel teapot — 
Fill with cold or leftover coffee and boiling water 
and set on stove to boil for ten minutes; remove 
the coffee and wash pot in hot soapy water. 

Varnish — (C. R. C.) — Treat as directed for 
paint. 

Vaseline (C. R. C.) Wash with turpentine. 

Boiling sets this stain. 

Vaseline — Saturate the spot with ether and lay 
a cup over it to prevent evaporation until the stain 
is removed. Use the ether with very great care; 
it is volatile and dangerous. 

Wine Treat as directed for fruit stains. 

Wagon Grease — (C. R. C.) — Soften with lard or 
oil and wash in soap and water.

"In time 
of health 
prepare 
for 
sickness " 



THE HOME NURSE 

In spite of all the barriers it is possible to devise, sickness and accident cannot 
always be kept from the home. And the physician's fight is half won if those 
in the home support his work with intelligence, assurance and quiet efficiency, 
while his function is often rendered unnecessary, and always it is a big aid to him, 
if "what to do first" or while awaiting him, is known and sensibly practiced. 

To the gentle hand of the woman belongs the care of the sick, and every 
woman should appreciate seriously that the time will come inevitably when on her 
will perhaps depend even the life of a loved one. This is not to say that she 
should fit herself as a professional nurse is fitted, but that "reasonable prepared- 
ness" should be hers in that she should learn the simple lessons imperatively nec- 
essary for the care of the sick, or the meeting of an emergency in her own home. 

No course in home nursing can equip one to take care of such critical issues as typhoid 
fever or pneumonia, but even in these knowledge and confidence, and the quiet assurance 
that comes of intelligence, will materially assist the professional nurse engaged, and help 
her to establish the proper atmosphere and carry on her own w^ork with infinitely greater 
ease and success. But for the ordinary home ills, learn the following first principles of 
home nursing. 

The day of the long face is past and gone. Cheerfulness, hopefulness, confidence, 
give the patient the feeling that in the very atmosphere is the sense of winning as a mat- 
ter of course. 

Sunlight, air and quiet, come next. Turn out any member of the family necessary to 
attain these for the sick. Sun and fresh air are the best cleansers and stimulants that 
exist. They purify polluted atmosphere, real and mental, better than any disinfectant or 
tonic known. Quiet clears away worry and irritation, small excitements and all sorts of 
nervous rubbish — and even pleasant excitements, including the entertaining of visitors, are 
included here.

HOME NURSING 

(Iowa State College Bulletin) 
I. VALUE OF KNOWLEDGE 

A working knowledge of the fundamental principles of home nursing gives 
power to interpret the directions of the physician and also puts the home maker in 
perfect sympathy with his directions. This spirit of cooperation removes a serious 
handicap which often prevents the physician from doing his best work. 

Serious illness is frequently avoided by timely preventive treatment which is 
the result of this knowledge of principles. 

A knowledge of the fundamental principles of nursing is essential in the wise 
treatment of emergencies. 

II. QUAUFICATIONS OF A NURSE 

The qualifications of the successful nurse are identical with the qualifications 
of the ideal woman. The chief qualifications are neatness, good temper, poise, 
tact, which is another name for common sense, and good health. 

The ability to adapt herself to all circumstances is a valuable asset. 

Neatness means clean person, simply combed hair, well shod feet, clean, sim- 
ply made, cotton dresses, clean teeth, clean hands and clean finger nails. 

Good health is so essential to the home nurse, that great care must be taken 
to maintain good physical condition. It is especially important that the home 
nurse eat simple, easily digested food at regular intervals, that she spend some time 
in the open air each day and that she plan for some sleeping hours out of each 
twenty-four. The welfare of the patient depends upon this. 

III. THE SICK ROOM 

A large room on the sunny side of the house is preferable. A room with two 
or more windows makes thorough ventilation more easily possible. A germ dis- 
ease should be cared for on the upper floor, to aid in preventing the contamina- 
tion of the lower floor. The room should have only a minimum amount of fur- 
niture. A painted or other hard finished wall is preferable. Upholstered furni- 
ture, thick rugs and other dust catchers should be avoided. Window^s should be 
securely screened. The bed should be so located as to protect eyes from strong 
light, and patient from direct draught. 

IV. KNOWLEDGE OF BACTERIA 

Bacteria are present practically every-where in nature. They are found in the 
air, in the soil, in salt and fresh water, in the food. 

The majority of bacteria, however, are harmless and many of them are bene- 
ficial. Under the latter may be named the putrefiers, nitrifiers and flavor produc- 
ers. Bacteria, which produce disease, are known as pathogenic bacteria. 

Methods of Destroying Bacteria B. Chemical agents. 

A. Physical agents. • y K 

I. Heat. 2- ^y '••'"■•^'- 

3. By soluble salts. 

Chemical agents 'which ^vill destroy bacteria are

DISINFECTANTS 

1. Bichloride of Mercury (corrosive sublimate): 

Standard solution, 1:1000 (I tablet to a pint of 
water). 

This is particularly serviceable for the disinfec- 
tion of wounds, the hands, and for washing wood- 
work, floors and furniture. 

Bichloride will discolor clothing and corrode 
metal, marble and porcelain, hence it is inapplic- 
able for the disinfection of instruments and for use 
in plumbing fixtures. 

2. Carbolic Acid or Phenol: A 5 per cent solu- 
tion will destroy non-spore bearing microorganisms 
very quickly. To insure the killing of bacterial 
spores add 0.5 per cent of hydrochloric acid. 

Carbolic acid will not discolor white materials or 
metals. It is one of the most common and most 
valuable of the disinfectants for handkerchiefs, 
towels, underclothing, napkins, etc. 

3. Lysol, Cresol and Creolin: These are very 
closely related to carbolic acid or phenol and are 
used similarly. 

4. Chloride of Lime: Dissolve chloride of lime 
of the best quality in pure water in the proportion 
of six ounces to the gallon. Keep in a stone jar 
or jug. Use one quart of this solution for each 
discharge from patient suffering with a contagious 
or infectious disease. Chloride of lime is used 
principally for disinfecting excreta, water closets, 
sinks and traps. 

5. Milk of Lime: Milk of lime is made by adding 
one part of dry freshly slacked lime to four parts 
of water. 

To disinfect excreta use twice as much of the 
milk of lime as the volume of the discharge. 
Thorough mixing and stirring are advisable. The 
mixture should stand one hour before being thrown 
into the water closet or before being buried. A 
5 per cent solution of carbolic acid may be used 
instead of the milk of lime. 

6. Formaldehyde: Formaldehyde is a gas readily 
soluble in water. It is commonly sold as formalin 
(a 40 per cent solution of formaldehyde in water). 
Formaldehyde is more commonly used for fumiga- 
tion than any other gas. It does not damage 
books, paintings, delicate fabrics, or attack ordin- 
ary dyes or metals. 

It can therefore be used for the disinfection of 
furnished rooms, sleeping cars, ambulances and 
closed vehicles. Formaldehyde is active only in 
the presence of moisture. The air of the room 
during fumigation should contain 75 per cent of 
moisture and the temperature of the room should 
be at least 50 degrees F. 

7. Alcohol: Alcohol of 70 per cent solution is 
frequently used as a disinfectant for thermometers, 
needles and to disinfect the skin. 



ANTISEPTICS 

1. Peroxide of Hydrogen: Peroxide of hydrogen 
will check bacterial growth. It is used on wounds, 
as a mouth wash and as a gargle. 

2. Listerine: Listerine is one of the common 
antiseptics used as a mouth wash and gargle. 

3. Boric Acid: Boric acid solution is made by 
dissolving the powder in hot water (a 4 per cent 
solution is usually used). It is used for eye and 
nasal applications and for mouth washes and for 
a cut or an abrasion of the skin, or a discharging 
sore. It is also used to sterilize thermometers and 
rubber nipples. 

4. Salt Solution: Use one level teaspoonful of 
salt to one pint of sterilized water. This possesses 
but slight antiseptic properties but it is much used 
on account of its stimulating effect on tissue. 

5. Condys Fluid: Condys fluid conains 1 6 grains 
of permanganate of potash crystals to one ounce 
of water. It is both a disinfectant and deodorant. 

VENTILATION 

"A constant supply of pure, fresh, flowing air" 
is essential to health. An adult requires 1,200 cubic 
feet of pure air every hour for breathing. Ventila- 
tion must be carried on continually day and night. 

Methods of Ventilation 

1. Gravity and Diffusion (natural means). 

2. Mechanical Ventilation (by propulsion or 
extraction of air). The air of the sick room must 
be kept pure, wholesome and cool. In almost every 
case the window can be kept open I Yl inches from 
the top without injury to the patient. The hot air 
rises and displaces the cold air. The sick room 
may be properly ventilated by arrangement of win- 
dows in adjoining rooms. A good circulation 
without a draught may be secured. A fire place 
is one of the very best ventilators. The tempera- 
ture of the sick room should be from 65 to 68 
degrees F. at night and 68 to 70 degrees F. in the 
daytime. 

CLEANLINESS 

The Floor: Remove rugs from room, swreep 
clean and wipe rugs with dampened cloth wrung 
out of hot water which has a few drops of for- 
maldehyde in it. 

Note: Great care must be taken in handling 
formaldehyde. The gas is a great irritant to eyes, 
nose and throat. 

If the case is a contagious disease, remove from 
room all rugs except one which can be easily fu- 
migated or if necessary, burned. 

Sweep the floor with a vacuum cleaner or wth 
a brush or broom covered ^vith a dampened cloth. 
Avoid disseminating the dust about the room in 
every possible way. Clean the floor thoroughly 
with soap and hot water and follow with a standard 
solution of bichloride of mercury — 1:1000 parts 
(I tablet to I pint of water). 



374 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Sec. VII— FAMILY DOCTOR. HEALTH 



The Furniture: Metallic or non-absorbent sub- 
stances are the ideal materials for beds in the sick 
room. These can be wiped with a disinfectant or 
antiseptic wash so that all cracks or crevices will 
be free of dust or germs. The remainder of the 
furniture should be thoroughly dusted every day 
with a dampened cloth even if the furniture is 
varnished or oiled. This can be done without 
injury to the furniture if it is rubbed immediately 



with a dry cloth. Once a week apply to the fur- 
niture a mixture of equal parts of oil and turpen- 
tine. Apply the emulsion sparingly and rub after- 
wards till all greasiness has disappeared. This 
will keep the furniture in good condition. The 
sick room should be thoroughly free from dust and 
should have a clean sweet odor about it. The 
use of deodorizers is questionable. The source of 
the odor should be removed. 



V. CARE OF PATIENT 
Bed and Clothing 

The three-quarter bed is a convenient size. The mattress should not be too 
hard and should have a perfectly level surface. The springs should be only mod- 
erately elastic and should present a level surface. When a protecting sheet is nec- 
essary, a rubber sheet or an oil cloth protecting sheet is preferable. In the absence 
of these, newspapers may be used. They should be removed frequently and burned. 
Sheets should be at least 2% yards in length (this is required by an Iowa state 
law for public beds) . Pillows should be of medium size. Blankets are lighter and 
more easily cleaned than quilts. 



Maldns the Bed 
Tuck in under sheet securely at head, foot and 
sides, being careful to make the fold under the 
mattress much deeper at the head than at the 
foot. This helps to keep a smooth surface under 
the shoulders and is a means of preventing irrita- 
tion of the skin. Place the protecting sheet of 
rubber, oilcloth or paper over the undersheet, be- 
ing careful to place it under the trunk of the body. 
Over this place the draw sheet, being careful to 
place the folded edge toward the head. Place the 
upper sheet with the wide hem toward the head. 
Fold the top of sheet over sufficiently to cover the 
edge of blanket (about 12 inches). Place blanket 
and spread over top sheet, folding top sheet over 
edge of blanket and spread. Tuck clothes in se- 
curely at the foot. Begin at lower right corner 
of bed. Lift upper sheet, blanket and spread in a 
diagonal fold from lower right corner of bed to 
edge of clothes. Tuck in bedding below fold, until 
the diagonal fold hangs smoothly. This holds the 
bedding securely at the foot and does not hold too 
firmly at the sides. 

Changing the Bed Clothing 
Have freshly aired and warmed bedding ready 
for use. Remove spread and fold neatly. Fold 
fresh draw sheet. Fold fresh under sheet in long 
fan-like folds. 

Roll patient as far toward the opposite edge of 
the bed as possible. Loosen bedding all around 
edge of the bed. Push soiled under sheets, one at 
a time, close to the back of the patient, keeping 
them in long straight folds. 

Place clean under sheets in position. Roll pa- 
tient to clean side of bed. Remove soiled under 
sheets, draw the clean ones over and secure under 



the mattress. Spread the fresh upper sheet and 
blanket over those already on the bed and draw 
out the soiled ones from the foot of the bed. Re- 
place spread and fold bedding at lower corner! 
with the diagonal fold as at first. Remove pillow 
and replace it by a freshly aired pillow with clean 
slip. Remove soiled clothing from the room. 

Note: In case of contagious diseases, the soiled 
bedding should be placed upon paper and should 
be carried out at once for disinfection. (Process 
is described under disinfectants.) In case of di- 
seases like scarlet fever which enter the body 
through the air passages, the bedding should be 
thoroughly fumigated before being hung outside 
to air. For all bedding which can be boiled, boil- 
ing one hour is an effective means of disinfection. 

SPONGE BATH IN BED 
Equipment — Hot water, cold water, bowl of 
warm water (98 degrees), mild soap, bath towel, 
face towel, wash clothes, mouth wash. 

Method 

Put patient between light weight blankets and 
remove clothing without exposing the patient. 
Wash and dry face and neck. Wash and dry arms, 
chest, abdomen, limbs and back. 

Precautions 

Rub firmly and dry thoroughly. Back may be 
rubbed with alcohol and dusted with talcum pow- 
der. Expose the body as little as possible. Dry 
each part thoroughly as soon as washed. Mouth 
should be washed thoroughly. 

Mouth Wash: Six to eight drops of alcohol in 
one-half glass of cold water. Equal parts of tinc- 
ture of orris, rose water and alcohol may be used 
or a solution of boric acid. Listerine or lemon

juice diluted with water may be used or equal 
parts of lemon juice and glycerine. 
General Care 

Pulse and Temperature: The clinical thermom- 
eter ia of great value to the mother in the home. 
To use the thermometer, shake down to 95 de- 
grees, place bulb under tongue, ask patient to 
close lips and hold thermometer for five minutes. 

To clean thermometer, wash in alcohol, or a 
carbolic acid solution (I to 20.) Wash thoroughly 
in cold v^ater before using. 

Temperature 

Normal temperature, 98.4 to 98.6 degrees F. 
High fever, 103 to 105 degrees F. 

Moderate fever, 101 to 103 degrees F. Sub- 
normal, 97 to 98 degrees F. 



Note: About 70 pulse corresponds with 98.4 
degrees. 

Respiration: Notice the rise and fall of the chest 
in breathing. The normal respiration is from 16 
to 1 8 per minute. 

Feeding the Patient 

Attractiveness is an important point to be con- 
sidered in the preparation of meals for the in- 
valid. A well-planned tray is more important than 
the well-planned meal for the normal person. It 
is absolutely necessary to study the needs of the 
patient and to plan a well-balanced meal to suit 
that condition, being careful to observe individual 
taste when it does not introduce sonie injurious 
food into the meal.

burns and bandage. 

Heat — Cover with gauze wet in saturated solu- 
tion of baking soda or carron oil. Bandage lightly 
to exclude air. 



Sunstroke — Place patient in cold bath and rub 
with ice. Ice water on head. 

Lightning Stroke — Warm bath (100 degrees). 
Mustard plaster over heart. Giving of stimulants, 
black coffee, I tablespoon brandy to equal part 
of water or one-half teaspoonful aromatic spirits 
of ammonia to one-third glass of hot water. 

Fainting — Lower head and raise feet. Loosen 
clothing. Open windows. Dash cold water over 
face. Rub limbs toward the body. If this does 
not restore consciousness very soon, apply heat 
and send for a physician. 

Drowning — To remove water from body, hold 
patient by the waist with head down. 

Clear mouth of mucous and pull tongue forward. 

To restore respiration: Place patient on back. 
Raise shoulders by means of a pillow or a roll of 
clothing. 

Seize arms near the elbows. Extend horizontally 
and then upward until the hands meet back of the 
head. 

Return arms close to the body until the elbows 
meet over the stomach. Hold the arms in this 



376 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Sec. VII— FAMILY DOCTOR, HEALTH 



position for a few seconSs and then repeat until 
about fifteen respirations have been completed. 
Be careful to keep the mouth open and the tongue 
forward. 

After consciousness is restored: 

Remove wet clothing. 

Hot bath. 

Heat applied over heart. 

Stimulants given. 

Brisk rubbing from extremities toward body. 

Croup — Cover bed with tent-like cover (use 
sheet). Place funnel of paper in nose of teakettle. 
Fill the kettle with boiling water. Introduce mouth 
of funnel at back of tent, being careful to have 
the funnel at least two feet above the patient. 
Place hot fomentations over chest and round 
throat. Cause vomiting by means of oil. 

POISONS 

Prevention: ELxtreme care is necessary. Be sure 
that bottles are properly labeled. Be sure that 
poisons are placed out of reach of children. Keep 
poisons in a special place to prevent accident. Do 
not take medicine in a dark room. Look at the 
label before removing cork. 

General Treatment: 

1. Emetic and cathartic. 

2. Antidote. 

3. Stimulant. 
Good emetics: 

Mustard and water. 

Salt and water. 

Large quantity of lukewarm water. 



Good cathartics: 

Salts (Epsom or Rochelle). 
Castor oil. 
Syrup of Figs. 

Note: The disagreeable taste of castor oil may 
be disguised as follows: 
I oz. castor oil. 
I oz. orange juice. 
^/l teaspoonful baking soda. 
Mix and take while foamy. 

Good stimulants: 
Black coffee. 

Aromatic spirits of ammonia (J/2 teaspoonful 
to J/3 cup hot vi^ater). 

Remedy for Poisons: 

Arsenic Magnesia. 

Sugar of Lead J/2 oz. Epsom salts. 

Phosphorus J/2 oz. Epsom salts (avoid oil). 

Strychnine Powdered charcoal. 

Mercury Whole beaten egg. 

Silver Nitrate — Strong salt solution. 

Strong acids (except carbolic) Alkali, mag- 
nesia, lime, whiting, baking soda or one tablespoon- 
full of ammonia to tvkro cups of water. Follow by 
milk, eggs, or olive oil. 

Carbolic acid — Rinse mouth in alcohol. Follo^v 
by two tablespoonsful of Epsom salt. 

Ammonia Vinegar or lemon juice. Follow by 

soothing liquids. 

Poison Ivy Wash in three per cent, solution of 

boracic acid solution. Follow by zinc ointment. 



EMERGENCIES IN GENERAL 

Before applying first aid methods, have a physician sent for. If patient is on the ground 
make the bystanders move back; if the accident is indoors, open the windows; if in a 
crowded public place indoors, carry the patient to an adjoining room or outdoors. 

Fainting — Due to bad air, mental shock from bad news, etc. Loosen the clothing, 
put a cloth wet in very cold water, at back of neck, lay patient with head slightly lowered. 
This treatment, with plenty of fresh air, will usually restore the patient quickly. It may be 
advisable to give a stimulant, aromatic ammonia, if obtainable, 20 drops in a tabelspoonful 
of water, repeated if necessary in ten minutes. 

In Shock, or unconsciousness from a profound excitement to the nervous system, in- 
stead of simple fainting, do not conclude that the broken leg or open wound causing the 
shock is necessarily of first importance. If there is insensibility, pallor, weak or absent pulse, 
or irregular, or feeble respiration, this as a rule must receive first attention. 

Restore normal heat, wrap patient in blankets, coats or rugs, apply hot water bottles 
or hot bricks or irons, and flannel wrung from hot water, to abdomen or extremities, and 
re-establish the circulation. Use stimulant, aromatic ammonia, coffee, brandy, or whiskey, 
diluted properly in hot water, and repeat in ten minutes. A patient apparently wholly uncon- 
scious will often swallow^ if a liquid is poured slowly over back of tongue; but watch out 
not to choke him. Absolute quiet. 



FAMILY DOCTOR, HEALTH— EMERGENCIES 377 

If it is the head that is injured, or the patient is delirious or highly excited, avoid 
stimulants; exert effort to quiet and soothe him. Do not use a stimulant if there is a hem- 
orrhage. 

Hemorrhage — Place patient with wound higher than the heart; if in bed and the hem- 
orrhage is from lungs, throat, nose or head, elevate the head of the bed high as possible, 
if from the bowels, bladder, abdomen, or lower parts, elevate foot of bed. if from a limb, 
elevate the limb. 

If it is a profuse, throbbing, spurting hemorrhage, lose no time; it is probably direct 
from a severed artery. Thrust the fingers right into the wound and press tight against 
where the blood seems to issue and try to stop the flow. Use a tourniquet, if possible. A 
very cold or very hot clean compress is preferable to the fingers, but unsterilized fingers 
are better than letting a patient bleed to death. Be sure to tell the doctor about having 
used the tourniquet. 

Try to find a point away from the wound where pressure will retard the flow of blood, 
by closing the blood vessels leading to it, and apply there a firm bandage, with a hard 
knot held and pressed tight at that point. Don't fail to tell the doctor about the tourniquet. 

A Venous Hemorrhage — usually from the rupture of a varicose vein — should have 
pressure applied below the wound instead of above it. It can be determined by the blood 
being darker, sometimes a purplish tinge, and by the fact that it flows steadily, not in 
spurts. If in doubt tie both above and below the wound. TTie doctor must be advised of 
the tourniquet. 

If the scalp is cut or it is a wound where the edges can be brought together, clean 
with hot water, boiled if possible, and close wound with gauze, hot. 

Artificial Respiration — Place patient face down, and pass fingers into throat to remove 
whatever may be obstructing the air. Then turn him over, pull the tongue out by grasping 
it with a cloth — the fingers alone will slip — and hold it out and down. Put a pillow or 
coat under back so as to slightly elevate the chest. Stand at patient's head, grasp the arms, 
draw them up until they meet above head; lower the arms, make the elbows meet over 
the stomach. Repeat in rythmic motions, about four seconds for the complete act. As 
soon as normal respiration is established, treat for shock as described above. 

Choking — If a child, and if the fingers will not dislodge the obstruction, swing the 
patient by the feet, have the back slapped sharply, and compress the chest with one hand 
between shoulders and one in front. If not at once relieved run with child to a doctor. 
If adult, lay on stomach. 

DroMming — Empty the lungs by holding patient by the stomach with head down, or 
rolling him on his stomach on a barrel or chair with a coat or hard pillow in it. Then apply 
the artificial respiration methods as above; finally the treatment for shock after respiration 
is restored. 

Do not give up until a physician tells you to — not even if the physician is an hour in 
coming. Persons have been resuscitated from drowning an hour or two after it was thought 
there was no hope. 

A Broken Bone — Notify physician, then support the broken member with an impro- 
vised splint, avoiding any pressure at the injured point; cover with a cloth and keep it 
wet with cold water; keep patient as quiet and comfortable as possible until the doctor 
arrives. Do not try to set the broken points of the bone together. 



378 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Sec. VII— FAMILY DOCTOR. HEALTH 

Sprains — Apply hot water for an hour or two. Immerse ankle, or wrist, in very hot 
water and increase heat of water to the limit of endurance; keep it at as hot temperature 
as it can stand for several hours. Repeat daily. When relieved apply adhesive strips or 
bandage to support the injured ligaments. Immobilize; i. e., see that joint is immovable. 

Dislocation — Pull into position, if possible; a physician may have to do this; you may 
simply have to wait if one or two trials are so painful to the patient as to show danger of 
his fainting. Apply treatment for sprains. 

Convlusions in Children — Prepare bath as hot as can safely bear; add two teaspoon- 
fuls mustard to small tub of water. If it can be done more quickly wrap child in blanket 
wrung from very hot water; use care not to bum the child's tender flesh. Apply cold wet 
towel to the head in any event. Empty the bowels as quickly as it can be done; best 
method, an enema of warm water with castile soap, or glycerine or olive oil. Give child 
a teaspoonful of ipecac every 1 5 minutes or have him drink warm water until he vomits, or 
induce vomiting by other means. 

EVERYDAY ACCIDENTS 

Accidents will happen as long as we are human. The irritating part is that we do 
not expect them. They all have one thing in common — they happen at the wrong time. 
When you have no sticking plaster you cut your finger. When a child bums his hand 
at the bonfire you are without olive oil or ointment to soothe the pain. Be prepared in 
time of peace. 

A good many serious results have been avoided by having a wound dressed prop- 
erly in the nick of time. Every household, that is to say every mother, ought to have a 
little box, cabinet or other safe place always filled with a few essentials for emergency use. 

Sticking plaster in various sizes ought to be the first thing in this cabinet. A small 
bottle of olive oil comes next. It is the open blister which sometimes causes tetanus. Per- 
oxide, carbolic acid diluted at 50 per cent, boracic acid for the eyes and to wash out sores 
before putting dressing on, are articles not to be dispensed with. Turpentine is also a 
splendid thing against infection of sores from msty nails. 

Do not forget the almost inevitable bottle of castor oil or milk of magnesia in case of 
fever and indigestion. A small quantity of essence of peppermint and spirits of ammonia 
should also be added, because sick stomach is a frequent occurrence with the little ones. 
A box of bicarbonate of soda and one of Epsom salts are indispensable. 

Liniment Inflammable — Never use a liniment near an open flame, for a liniment usu- 
ally contains some substance of an inflammable nature. 

For a Rusty Nail Accident paint with tincture iodine at once on the afflicted part. 

Foreign Matter in the Eye — If a smut has only gone on to the edge of your eye, it is 
quite easy to take off, but if it has got right in it may be difficult to move. 

An excellent method, if you are out of doors and have no implements at hand, is to 
shut the good eye, hold down the lid with your finger and roll the bad eye as much as 
you possibly can. Try to look with it right round to one side and then round to the other 
side. After you have done this for a minute or so, wipe the eye carefully with a soft hand- 
kerchief. You will probably find that the smut comes off on the handkerchief, as the roll- 
ing has shifted it to the front and onto the edge of the lid and made it easy to reach. 

Another way is to close the bad eye with your finger, leaving the good eye open. 
Then blow your nose violently two or three times. When you open the bad eye again you 



FAMILY DOCTOR. HEALTH— ACCIDENTS 379 

will probably find that it is quite comfortable, and that the smut has vanished. The tears 
have washed it out. 

If the accident occurs indoors, where there is someone to help you, the best way 
of putting the matter right is to get some one to dip a small brush in castor oil and take 
the smut away with that. You must use castor oil, not olive oil, which might possibly 
injure the eye, and you must have a very soft,clean brush. The patient should look up to 
the ceiling if the smut is at the bottom of the eye, and sideways and downwards if it is at 
the top. 

■ Swallowing a Fish Bone — Swallowing a piece of dry bread or cracker, if a fish bone is 
lodged in the throat, is a good remedy, but the acid from a lemon slowly sucked and swal- 
lowed will dissolve the bone to a jelly so that it will slip down easily.

ELBOW GREASE 

WITH HOT WATER AND SOAP 

Modern Army Practice, as taught in the Medical Officers' Reserve Corps, discards all use- 
lessness and foolishness. In the Armies of the Allies, the entire question of antiseptics 
and disinfectants simmers down to about ten per cent credit to two or three simple 
chemicals, and ninety per cent soap and hot water and ELBOW GREASE. 

Every woman should read and study the following LECTURE, given before the Med- 
ical Officers' Reserve Corps, Camp Greenleaf, Medical Officers' Training Camp, Fort 
Oglethorpe, Georgia, October, 1917. This is army training for medical officers. 

DISI^fFECTION AND ISOLATION 

By MAJOR ABBOTT of the U. S. Army 

DO IT WELI^DO IT CHEERFULLY— DO IT NOW 

I suppose a good many of you men in this audience have had the experience of going into 
houses and being met by a terrible stink, and when you looked about you found little 
saucers of badly smelling stuff under the sofa, under the table, under the bed, around the 
hallways, and other places. That was one of the old ways of disinfection and purifying 
the atmosphere. I may be wrong about it, but 1 have an idea it started from the days when 
the only disinfection known, in which any confidence was placed, was the burning of sul- 
phur; and in the very old book on quarantine and isolation you would see pictures of the 
Health Doctor dressed in oil silk or leather, looking as if he had on a gas mask extending 
down to his feet. He is depicted as burning sulphur in an open brazier and going through 
the motions of purifying the atmosphere. As funny as that may be, it is fundamentally the 
idea which Lyster held. Lyster had the idea that had existed for years that the atmosphere 
reeked with living, infective germs. It was also thought that round about a person having a 
contagious disease there was always an atmosphere that was diseased, laden with disease 
producing germs. Today we know that is not so. It is very doubtful to the minds of 
many who have studied this subject that there is little if any conveyance of disease by 
the atmosphere. The general opinion is that conveyance of disease from one individual 
to another is by direct contact, or by objects which have been in immediate contact with 
diseased persons. I shall refer to that later on. 

PERFECT NONSENSE of surgical work, but such disinfection as is em- 

I am asked to speak on the question of disin- ployed in contagious disease. If a person with a 

fection and isolation. The reason for this invita- contagious disease has occupied a room, and you 

tion 1 think is due to the fact that a great many want the room safe for somebody else to sleep in, 

men think that the spraying about of a little for- yo" must destroy the specific disease producing 

maldehyde and raising a smell, which causes your agents. It is not necessary to destroy all living 

eyes to water, and causes you to be very uncom- microscopic bodies. The two things are quite 

fortable for a few minutes, is disinfecting. It is different. Take, for instance, a typhoid stool, you 

perfect nonsense; it does not do anything of the ''"''« ■' " infective; that it can be disinfected very 

kind. For instance, you can fill a room with the «a'>'y ^V pouring a little boiling water on it, about 



old formaldehyde lamps, with which most of you ^^ -""ch as the amount of the stool, and allowing 

are acquainted, close the room up tight, and all ■' '° «tan<l '» <=ooI; it is then disinfected. But it is 

those lamps will not generate enough formaldehyde "»' sterilized. We do not care whether it is steri- 

to properly disinfect that room. Let us under- ''«d or not so long as it is incapable of convey- 

stand before we begin what disinfection aims to '"8 typhoid fever. That is the distinction between 

do. It aims to destroy infected matter: it is not disinfection and sterilization. Deodoration, as you 

necessarily sterilization. Sterilization is another all know, means the destruction of bad odors, 

thing. In most of your ^ork, you don't care Sometimes bad odors creep in where one has been 

whether you sterilize or not. 1 am not speaking careless, but as a rule bad odors have no business 



382 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Sec. VII— FAMILY DOCTOR. HEALTH 



to exist, and if we are alert in the matter of clean- 
liness there will be no bad odors. Deodorization 
can be used sometimes where circumstances are 
such that call for its use, but it does not neces- 
sarily disinfect. It is better to prevent the de- 
velopment of bad odors than to try to destroy 
them. Antiseptics, you all know what that means, 
may or may not be disinfectants. Antiseptics are 
substances that prevent the growth of organism, 
but are not always germicidal. It is not my inten- 
tion to go into the long list of germicides. You 
find every book filled with them, but my intention 
this morning is to bring the matter down to the 
simplest basis and to see what we can do with the 
things always at hand. You will have no manu- 
facturing chemist at hand on the march or in 
camp, and you will have to get results with what 
you have at hand. Let us discuss for a few min- 
utes the way in which disinfectants act. We can 
begin by stating that there is no necessity what- 
ever for trying to disinfect the atmosphere; the 
atmosphere is probably not infected; and if it were, 
I doubt if we could disinfect it with the means at 
our disposal. 

NO ATMOSPHERIC DISINFECTION 

Lyster, in his early laboratory work, operated 
under a carbolic acid spray, the idea being that the 
atmosphere was alive with living germs and the 
spraying killed them. We know now that the at- 
mosphere is not alive with germs. In order for 
a disinfectant to act, it must come in immediate 
contact with the germ to be killed. We do not 
know as much as we would like of the philosophy 
of disinfection, but we know sufficient to justify 
this statement, if we destroy germs by chemical 
disinfectants, there has been a destructive union. 
When, for example, corrosive sublimate is used for 
the purpose of killing germ life, we find that a 
definite amount of the salt will kill a definite 
amount of germs. Just as a certain amount of 
hydrochloric acid will neutralize a certain amount 
of caustic soda. Both factors in such a union have 
lost their characteristics. But if you have an in- 
fected stool and mix corrosive sublimate with it, 
the chances are a great part, if not all of it, will 
combine with protoid material, other than the 
infected germ, and you may or may not accom- 
plish what you have set out to do. Some of the 
germicides act as protoplosnic poisons. Hydro- 
cyanic acid, for instance, acts in that way in all 
probability. They combine with material, but its 
action is not quite clear. Nevertheless, it results 
in the death of the germ. Then we have the oxi- 
dizing and reducing agents, and the elements react- 
ing for the disassociating action of the electric 
current. We know sea water is not germicidal, 
but, suppose ^ve pass an electric current through 
the sea salt. By that 'we , disassociate the halogen 
compounds and in the nascent they are active 
germicides. As a matter of fact, if the electric 



current be passed through rain sewerage, reeking 
with living germs, you bring about a complete dis- 
infection of it through such disassociation of salts 
contained in it. 



The 



THE ACTION OF SUNLIGHT 

we have sunlight. We cannot explain 



how sunlight acts, but we know it does, but it only 
acts under certain conditions, and in a very limited 
degree. We have all been taught that fresh air 
and sunlight are great purifiers. If you take a 
clear transparent gelatine, such as is used in labo- 
ratories, and inoculate that gelatine with thou- 
sands of bacteria, and put part of it in a shadow 
and the other where the sun can strike it under 
the most favorable conditions you will find after 
exposure of half an hour that many of the germs 
that have been exposed to the sunlight will not 
grow, and those under the shadow will grow abun- 
dantly. Such observations led to some very inter- 
esting experiments with furs and textiles, which 
could not be disinfected with heat or chemicals 
without destroying them. The results of these ex- 
periments were of no practical use. It was found 
that after purposely infected furs had been placed 
in the direct sunlight for varying lengths of time 
only the tips of the furs were disinfected. In other 
words, the slight shadow cast by the hairs a short 
distance down into the fur protected the sun's 
action. While interesting, the experiment was of 
no practical use. Now, we come to the universal 
purifier, upon which you can always rely, and 
practically always get; that is heat. 

THE UNIVERSAL PURIFIER— HEAT 

On the road and in camp we can always get 
fire and hot water. Don't think it necessary to burn 
all infected objects. It is often easier to burn use- 
less infected objects than to disinfect them. Use ' 
heat so as to disinfect without destroying. It is 
not always necessary to use the excessive grades 
of heat we are sometimes told. You have to re- , 
member that not all germs are equally resistant, 
and it is interesting to note that those most lowly 
resistant are the ones vire deal with most frequently. 
Very few of the known disease producing germs are 
of high resistance. The anthrax germ is of high 
resistance, but only very rarely encountered in our 
work. The tetanus germ is resistant, but we com- 
bat its lethal activities vrith antitoxin, and on all 
the fronts we have a supply of antitoxin. Cholera, 
typhoid fever, dysentery, diphtheria, etc., are lowly 
resisting germs. They do not even require boiling 
water for their destruction. The reason why the 
term boiling water is used, is to eliminate the use 
of a thermometer. If you have an orderly who 
has never been trained in the laboratory, and you 
tell him to bring the temperature of water to 70° 
or 75° C, he may not know what 75° C. means, 
and you do not always have a thermometer at 
hand; but if you tell him to boil it, he knows what 



' 



FAMILY DOCTOR— HEALTH— ELBOW GREASE 



383 



it means. If you have a thermometer about you, 
and desire not to seriously injure objects being 
disinfected, you can disinfect practically everything 
you want if you expose them to water of 80° C. 
temperature for half an hour. 

DISINFECTING WITH STEAM 

Another means of disinfecting by moist heat is 
steam. You ask, how are we to get steam on the 
road? With a very little ingenuity you can make 
a steam sterilizer, if you remember that it is only 
a glorified potato steamer, such as is in every 
kitchen; a tin can with a perforated false bottom. 
6 inches from the bottom of the can, and a cover 
to the can, makes an excellent sterilizer. About 
4 inches of water in the can, the false bottom put 
in place and the objects to be sterilized put into 
the chamber, the can covered and put on the fire 
and the water kept boiling for one-half hour is all 
that is needed. That is only a modication of the 
Serbian barrel you have seen referred to in the 
books. The Serbian barrel is only a barrel with 
a cover and holes in the bottom. It is placed, 
after being filled with obects to be disinfected and 
covered — over a receptacle containing boiling 
water. The cracks between barrel and water re- 
ceptacle are plastered up with mud and the steam 
allowed to pass through the barrel for the required 
time. You can make one in a few minutes, and 
there is no reason in the world why it should not 
do the work. Boiling water is one of the most 
useful things you can use, you can get it anywhere. 
I am not speaking about disinfecting surgical in- 
struments in the operating room, but of what you 
can do and must do on the road. 

DISINFECTION AND ISOLATION 

Another question comes up in connection with 
this matter. To what extent are you going to use 
disinfectants, and to what extent are you to try 
isolation when cases of infectious diseases break 
out among troops? You will not be supplied with 
equipment such as you find in our big municipal 
hospitals for the care of contagious disease. Can 
anything be done to prevent the spread of disease? 
1 think it can, and usually without much disinfec- 
tion at all. I suppose if 1 were to say to most men 
in this audience, "1 will take you into an operating 
room, shall not give you any chemicals at all, and 
I want you to define a reasonably safe aseptic 
system," I don't believe there is a man in the audi- 
ence who could not write out a reasonably safe 
system. If you remember that, when the time 
comes to care for germ infective cases you can 
easily win the fight. In many hospitals now the 
contagious diseases are isolated by housing them 
in separate buildings, or in a separate part of the 
building, and for convenience, this is desirable. 
But it is not a necessity. Unless you are absolutely 
careful of every aseptic detail you and your nurses 



will serve as a transmitter. In my own judgment 
careless doctors and attendants are the great trans- 
mitters of disease. 1 expect that is an extremely 
unpleasant statement, but when you examine into 
the facts, 1 think you will agree with me. A man 
who does not carry out on himself and insist that 
his associates and aids do likewise the most scrupu- 
lous aseptic precautions, is more apt to' carry in- 
fection to the next person, than any amount of 
infected air, so-called. Doctors and nurses must 
not only be informed on what is meant by surgical 
aseptic, but must practice it by keeping themselves 
and all appliances surgically clean. Just now we 
have a few cases of measles in camp. There is a 
general opinion that the most infectious stage of 
measles is during the catarrhal condition that pre- 
cedes the eruption. 

MEASLES AN ILLUSTRATION 

We do not recognize measles when it is most 
infective. When aware that it is measles, what 
should wc remember? We are to remember that 
the infectious material from that case is not, as 
we were formerly taught, blowing about by the 
air, but we are to remember that the infectious 
material of that disease has leaked away from the 
patient through the eyes, nose and mouth, and so 
far as we know, nowhere else. Consequently, all 
the bed clothing, the pillow slips and body cloth- 
ing of that individual are the things infected, and 
probably the only things. Any man, woman or 
child, with whom that individual has come in con- 
tact are to be isolated and kept under observation 
until we know whether they have or have not 
measles. When that is done, you have done all 
you can do. That is all there is to it. There is 
no sense whatever in burning a lot of sulphur and 
putting out formaldehyde in cases of that kind. 
The bed clothing, body clothing and pillow slips 
can be boiled and that is all that you can do. By 
doing that and isolating contacts outbreaks of 
measles can be held up. If you consult the daily 
reports in headquarters office, you will see for 
two months we have had an occasional case of 
measles, but we have had no spread. It would be 
a serious matter for us to have an outbreak of 
measles in this camp at the present time. 

Pneumonia following measles is a serious mat- 
ter, and we could not properly care for a large 
number of measles cases under our present sur- 
roundings, but by putting into practice the simple 
method of isolation of contacts for a period of 
observation, and the boiling of body clothing and 
bed clothing, it can be kept down. 

DIPHTHERIA, TYPHOID, SMALLPOX 

Similarly with diphtheria. We know that in 
cases of diphtheria the infectious matter comes 
from the throat and nowhere else; nothing from 
the skin, nothing from the urine, and nothing from 
the bowels. It is the same way in cases of typhoid 



384 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Sec. VII— FAMILY DOCTOR. HEALTH 



fever, dysentery and cholera. The infectious 
agents do not come from the skin, they are not 
breathed out, not coughed out, but they come from 
the bowels and urine in cases of typhoid fever, and 
from the bowels only in cases of cholera and dys- 
entery. You have but to disinfect the excreta. You 
can use almost anything you please, chloride of 
lime is orie of the very best and cheapest and one 
of the most effective things we have. When we 
come to smallpox, I trust you don't encounter it, but 
if you do it is your own fault, and I hope you may 
have all the inconvenience possible, for you can 
prevent it by seeing that every man in your com- 
mand is successfully vaccinated. Don't take the 
man's word when he says he has already been 
vaccinated several times and it don't take. 1 have 
had that said to me time and time again. In most 
cases 1 have found that if the operation be properly 
performed and trustworthy virus used a successful 
vaccination results. 

I think from what I have said you will see that 
the principles of isolation are rather simple. You 
must know how the infectious matters leave the 
body; how they invade other bodies, and that it is 
not necessary to have elaborate apparatus for the 
destruction. Suppose we were all on the march 
with troops and had nothing but soap and water 
for washing purposes and infectious diseases ap- 
peared. Could we prevent the spread of such dis- 
eases and render tents and bedding safe for the 
use of other men? 

HOT WATER, SOAP AND ELBOW GREASE 

I do not believe that there is any method of dis- 
fection that is better than hot water, soap and 
elbow grease. Of course, we cannot take house- 
wives on the road with us, but if we could I would 
turn the housewives loose and let them "house- 
clean." Any germ that can resist the house-clean- 
ing process deserves to live. If all of you will 
tackle a shack or a tent and clean it the same 
vigorous way a vroman cleans up a house when 
she puts her mind on it, it will be a perfectly safe 
place to sleep, and I wouldn't hesitate to sleep 
there, or let my children sleep there. There is no 
better way to rid quarters of danger than that. 

What is the effect of airing quarters? Does the 
air have any effect in destroying germs? Only 
indirectly. Very few of the infective organisms 
with which we are acquainted will stand drying 
for any length of time. None of them will with- 
stand absolute drying, except in the spore stage. 
The atmosphere has a drying effect. Sunlight has 
a psychological effect: soap and water and elbow 
grease has a real effect. As most important ad- 
juncts we have bacterial prophylactic vaccines and 
the anti sera. Cleaning up, the use of prophylactic 
inoculations, vaccines and anti sera, aseptic hand- 
ling of cases and the isolation of contacts for ob- 
servation vfill usually solve most of our difficulties. 



USEFUL GERMICIDES 

As to useful germicides the list may be small. 
All of the caustic alkalis are germicidal. Ordinary 
unslaked lime is an excellent disinfectant. When 
unslaked lime is mixed with the mass until it reacts 
alkaline, the mass is disinfected in two or three 
hours. It is not sterilized, we don't care about 
that, but it is disinfected. Lime is usually sup- 
plied, because it is cheap, non-poisonous and ef- 
fective. 

Acids possess a germicidal action. Nitric acid 
and sulphuric acid, and many of the organic acids 
possess this property. Certain salts are used, but 
I would not suggest the routine use as they are 
uncertain in their action. I cannot do better than 
advise you to pin some faith to chloride of lime 
and freshly slaked lime as two of the best. 

GASEOUS DISINFECTANTS 

As to gaseous disinfectants. One that is used 
is sulphur dioxide. For a century or more sulphur 
dioxide was the only gaseous disinfectant used, and 
we believed in it; but investigations show that in 
its dry state it has very little germicidal value. 

It is known that if steam be introduced into the 
room with the sulphur dioxide we have a germi- 
cide, but you bleach everything in the room. The 
brass work is tarnished, and as a result it is ob- 
jectionable. Sulphur dioxide is now limited large- 
ly, not to disinfecting purposes, but to the purpose 
of getting rid of vermin, for the destruction of 
rats, mice and insects, and there is probably noth- 
ing better. Another gaseous disinfectant that I 
know none of you will use, yet it has a high ger- 
micidal power, is hydrocyanic acid. It is a very 
deadly poison, as you all know. In the hands of 
other than a trained and competent laboratory 
man hydrocyanic acid should not be used. 

i 
THE FORMALDEHEYDE DELUSION ' 

We thought the millennium had been reached 
when formaldehyde vras introduced. It came to 
us as a gas that had wonderful power. As for- 
maldeheyde gas is incompletely burned methol 
alcohol, we burned wood alcohol under such cir- 
cumstances that combustion was incomplete, and 
we thought we had sufficient formaldeheyde to do 
the work. So formaldeheyde lamps were sold to 
all of us. In five minutes sufficient formaldeheyde 
was generated to start our eyes watering, and we 
supposed germs were being killed. But it soon 
became evident that none of the lamps generated 
sufficient formaldeheyde to disinfect a room. When 
that fact was made known larger lamps were made, 
but with little or no advance. The next step taken 
was the disengagement of formaldeheyde from its 
solution. Apparatus was devised in which the 
formaldeheyde solution was subjected to high heat 
— the gas thus disengaged was led into the closed 
room by a tube passed through the keyhole. The 



FAMILY DOCTOR— HEALTH— ELBOW GREASE 



385 



best of such plans did not accomplish more than 
85% of disinfection; it did not render free of dan- 
ger over over 85 of 100 purposely infected articles 
placed in the room. Then it was suggested to try 
out the old plan of using the spray, or a modifica- 
tion of it. It has been found by experiments and 
otherwise, that equal parts of saturated solution of 
formaldeheyde and water, when atomized over all 
horizontal surface of a room, in closets, in bureau 
drawers and bedding, will completely disinfect a 
closed and sealed room in from six to eight hours. 
The method has one defect; it is painful to the 
muscus membranes and in susceptible persons 
causes deomatitis. The irritation of the mucuous 
membrane is not a serious matter. The n\ost effec- 
tive way I know of for applying formaldeheyde is 
in water, equal parts of formaldeheyde and water 
sprayed on in a house with an atomizer, so you can 
get the combined action of formaldeheyde in solu- 
tion, and of the gas that is disengaged from it. 

If 1 bring you any message at all in this lecture, 
it is this: that you can get results by ordinary 
house-cleaning methods. 

ISOLATION 

Some of you have doubtless read those inter- 
esting articles by Dr. Chapin, of Rhode Island. 
He has been advocating the abandonment of ter- 
minal disinfection. I think he is right. He strong- 
ly advocates the abandonment of many former 
methods of isolation. He maintains that one can 
keep various infective cases side by side in the 
same hospital ward without any transmission. 
About two years or more before Dr. Chapin whote 



those articles, large hospitals in France and Eng- 
land had fully proven out that point. They had 
simply taken large wards, separated these cases 
one from the other, not by partitions, but by 
screens, had them all in the same room. They 
had specially trained attendants, who had been 
trained in surgical asepiit. A nurse, when she 
was in attendance upon a case of measles, for in- 
stance, knew perfectly well what was expected of 
her before she went to attend a case of diphtheria, 
etc. She wore, when she attended a case of 
measles, an overslip to cover her clothing, her hair 
was also covered, and when she left the case she 
left her overslip in the measles room. Her hands 
were washed with soap and water, and if need be, 
disinfected. She then could go safely to the scarlet 
fever case and put on the gown she should wear 
with that case, and when she left that case she 
could go to the diphtheria case. The records of 
those hospitals has shown that in not one instance 
has there been any more mixed infection or trans- 
mission of infection where these methods have been 
used than by the old methods which involved great 
expenditures, and which have been found to be 
often defective. So, we are coming now, I think, 
to see these things in a very common sense way. 

CONCLUSION 

If we know where the infection occurs, know 
the places through which the infectious agents 
escape from the individual, and know the agents 
by which these infectious agents can be killed, we 
will realize that we can control these cases with- 
out elaborate equipment.

DIET FOR INVALIDS 

SOME TEMPTING, NOURISHING, EASILY DIGESTED DISHES 
FOR THE SICK AND CONVALESCENT 

(From Iowa State College Bulletin, "Home Nursing") 
Invalid diet is classified as: 
1. Liquid: Including broths, milk, cocoa, cream soups. 
II. Soft Diet: Including soft cooked eggs, milk toast, custards. 
III. Solid: Including cereals, eggs, vegetables, meat, desserts. 
The doctor will prescribe the diet and the nurse must see that it is properly 
prepared and served. She should never consult the patient as to his diet. If he 
should express a desire for a certain food which is allowable, it may be served at 
the next meal. 

Before bringing in the tray, have the patient ready for the meal— face and 
hands bathed and pillows adjusted. If an invalid's table is not available, a pile of 
magazmes may be put on each side of the patient's knees on which to set the tray. 
The tray should be made just as attractive as possible — never crowded. It is bet- 
ter to serve too little and bring more on request than to destroy the appetite with 
an overloaded tray. Serve hot foods hot and cold foods cold. 

Some foods though not especially nourishing are useful as stimulants to the 
appetite. Among these are fruit beverages, beef tea and oysters. Milk and eggs 
are the main artic'es of food in soft diet. These should both be cooked at a low 
temperature because of the albumen, which is rendered very indigestible by boiling. 

Toast should be crisp all through, not just browned on surface. It may be 
softened with hot milk or water. 

Cereals should be thoroughly cooked. 

Cream soups add variety to the milk diet. 

Desserts, as gelatin and ices, furnish an attractive means of serving liquid 
roods in solid form.

Chicken Broth — Cut 2 lbs. chicken into pieces; 
cover with 2 quarts cold water; add I small onion, 
simmer three hours or until meat is tender. Re- 
move meat, cool stock, remove fat, reheat and 
add % cups cooked rice. Season and serve. 

Egg Broth — I cup hot meat broth, I egg, Yi 
teaspoonful salt. Beat the white and yolk of egg 
separately. To the yolk add gradually the hot 
broth, stirring constantly. Add salt and fold in 
well beaten white. Reheat and serve. 

Raw Beef Sandwich — Scrape beef with dull knife, 
place between buttered slices of bread. Cut in 
fancy shapes. Toast in oven. (Meat for this pur- 
pose niust be inspected). 

Fruit Whip — 4 tablespoonfuls fruit pulp, white 
of 1 egg, 2 tablespoonfuls powdered sugar, lemon 
juice to taste. Beat white of egg until stiff, add 
pulp, sugar, and lemon juice to taste. Beat until 
stiff. Serve with boiled custard. 

Oat Jelly — Yi cup rolled oats, !4 teaspoonful 
salt, I Yl cups boiling water. Add oats mixed with 
salt to boiling water gradually. Boil 2 minutes, 
then steam in double boiler 45 minutes to 1 hour.

serve with sugar and cream. 

Note: When the jelly begins to harden, add 1 
tablespoonful dissolved gelatin and Yl cup whipped 
cream, mould in small cups and serve with straw- 
berries and cream as a dessert or as a breakfast 
dish. 

Poached Eggs — Eggs for poaching should be as 
fresh as possible. If not perfectly fresh, the 
tendency to flatten may be overcome by adding 
a small amount of vinegar to the water in which 
they are cooked. They may also be kept round 
by stirring the water until it is whirling vigorously 
and dropping the egg into it. 

Salt may be used instead of vinegar; the eggs 
thereafter need not be salted at table. 

Eggs Scrambled in Milk — 2 eggs, 2 slices toast, 
Yi teaspoonful salt, 2 tablespoonfuls milk, 1 tea- 
spoonful butter. Beat whites and yolks separately. 



add salt to yolks. Fold in whites. Add to hot milk 
and pour into a buttered pan. Cook until creamy, 
stirring and scrapeing from the bottom of the pan 
as it thickens, { 

Beef Broth Custard — Ya cup beef broth, 2 eggs, 
Ya cup ground carrot, 1 tablespoon chopped pep-

yolk. Pour over a small portion of the lemonade, 
and repeat until all of the egg and lemonade are 
used. Set glass on small plate with doily. Place 
two straws in glass of lemonade. Serve on a tray 
with a yellow flower. 1 

A Nutritious Beverage — 1 quart milk, I pint

place egg on toast, garnish and serve at once. 

Toast — Cut bread in Ya '"• slices, remove crust 
and toast a golden brown. It should be crisp all 
through. 

Milk Toast — 2 slices of toast, 1 teaspoonful but- 
ter, 1 tablespoonful flour, 1 cup milk, Yl *«»■ 
spoonful salt. Melt the butter, add dry ingredients, 
stir until thoroughly blended; add milk gradually 
and cook until it thickens. Pour over buttered 
toast. 



THE NURSE'S KITCHEN 
Some Other Invalid Recipes 



Cream Toast — Make thin slices of golden brown 
toast, crisp and dry. Place the slices in a wire 
sieve, and steam until soft over hot water. Then 

butter and put in a soup plate about three slices 

cut in half. Over them pour white sauce. Make 
this by heating a cupful of milk in a double boiler 
and then adding two tablespoonfuls of flour rubbed 
into two tablespoonfuls of butter. Cook gently 
over a low heat until the flour has lost its starchy 



taste. Season with salt and pepper and serve very 
hot. Such a dish loses its appetizing qualities if 
it is not hot when served, so it should be carefully 
covered in transit from the kitchen to the room. 

Egg-nog — Heat the yolk of an egg until it is 
creamy and add a pinch of salt; then add enough 
milk to fill a glass three-quarters full. Last, add 
the white beaten stiff, and sprinkle with grated

nutmeg. This is nourishing and excepting in cases 
where raw egg cannot be digested, is easily assim- 
ilated. Use whiskey or brandy in egg-nog only 
if patient needs stimulant on doctor's orders. 

Lamb Broth — Lamb broth can be taken by al- 
most every one. Here is a good recipe for mak- 
ing it. Have a pound of the neck of Iamb cut 
into small pieces and put it in a granite or alumi- 
num saucepan with two cupfuls of cold water 
for two hours. Then bring it to the boiling point 
and let it cook just below the boiling point, for 
three hours. Strain and season with salt. This 
can be made in a tireless cooker. 

Chicken Broth — This can be made in the same 
way as lamb broth. Use the neck, the v\?ings, and 
the back of chicken, and reserve the other parts 
for other uses. If rice can be taken, a little rice 
well boiled, can be added to either chicken or 
Iamb broth. 

Clam Broth — Wash six clams and put them in 
a kettle with half a cupful of cold water. Steam 
until they have opened, strain, and serve. Clam 
broth and beef broth may both be frozen, just to 
the mush stage, and then served in a sherbet glass. 
A feverish patient often finds this broth sherbet 
very tempting. 

Cornmeal Gruel — All gruels must be thoroughly 
cooked, not very thick, and free from lumps. Put 
three tablespoonfuls of cornmeal into a third of 
a cupful of cold water, salt to taste, and then add 
two cupfuls of boiling water. Boil twenty minutes, 
stirring constantly, or else cook in a double boiler 
an hour. 

Cracker Gruel — Break a soda cracker or two, 
buttered thin, into a cupful of boiling milk, and 
cook, stirring constantly, for three or four minutes. 
Season with salt. 

Oatmeal Gruel — Cook half a cupful of prepared 
oatmeal in a quart of boiling salted water for a 
quarter of an hour. 

Rice Gruel — Cook two tablespoonfuls of rice in 
two cupfuls of salted water. When the rice is 
cooked to pieces, strain and dilute to taste with 
hot milk. 

Stewed Prunes and Figs — Wash prunes or figs 
to be stewed and then soak in cold water for ten 
hours. Cook for half an hour in the same water. 
Sweeten slightly if necessary. 

Spinach on Toast — Cook some well-washed 
spinach for twenty minutes in boiling salted water, 
drain it and rub it through a sieve. Have ready 
a piece of buttered, thin toast which has been 
quickly dipped in boiling water. Moisten the 
spinach with a little melted butter, season with 
salt and pepper, and pile neatly on toast. 



Apple Snow — Bake an apple in an earthen dish, 
covered. Remove core and skin before baking. 
Then rub it through a sieve, add it to the well- 
beaten white of an egg and beat for twenty minutes. 
Sweeten to taste and serve piled up in a glass cup. 

Orange Whip — Squeeze the juice from an 
orange. Beat the white of an egg and add a 
tablespoonful of sugar and a little of the orange 
juice, beating stiff again. Then pour the rest of 
the juice into a glass cup, pile on the white and 
serve. 

Custard with Fruit — Very often good boiled 
custard can be served to advantage with fruit. The 
fruit adds attractiveness to the custard and so 
tempts the appetite. A few prunes, neatly cut in 
pieces, can be covered with custard; dates can bo 
used in the same way; orange pulp cut in dice 
can be added to it or a spoonful of apple snow 
can be placed on top of custard. 

Grape Fruit and Orange Grapefruit pulp cut 

in dice and served in a glass with the juice of an 
orange and very little sugar, with a tablespoonful 
of brandy or sherry, if that is allowed, makes a 
most refreshing dish for an invalid. 

Bavarian Cream Bavarian creams of all sorts 

make delicious and nourishing desserts for invalids. 
For chocolate Bavarian cream, soak half a box of 
gelatin in cold water for at least a half hour. 
In a double boiler, heat one pint of milk and two 
ounces of grated chocolate: add the gelatine and 
stir until dissolved. Next add half a cup of sugar 
and remove from the stove. Turn into a deep bowl 
and add one teaspoonful of vanilla; set this bowl 
into a pan of ice water and stir until it thickens 
like a sauce; then add a pint of cream whipped 
stiff. Stir lightly, pour into a mold, wet with cold 
water, set it on ice and serve with whipped cream. 
This must be made very early in the morning if 
it is to be used for lunch or tea. If a fruit cream 
is desired substitute fruit juice, stewed and strained, 
or the juice from canned fruit, for the milk, omit- 
ting the grated chocolate. Both raspberry and 
peach Bavarian cream are delicious. 

Orange Albumen — White I egg, J/3 cup orange 
juice, I/2 glass crushed ice, sugar if necessary, stir 

white of egg ■with fork. Add orange juice strain 

over ice. 

Milk Whip ^ cup cream milk, 2 teaspoonful 

sugar, few grains nutmeg, pinch salt, J/2 teaspoon- 
ful vanilla or 3 teaspoonfuls sherry, few pieces of 
ice. Put in Mason jar, shake thoroughly, serve 
at once. 

Whey — I cup milk at 98 degrees P., Yl rennin 
tablet dissolved in cold water, mix, pour in bowl, 
allow to set. When thick cut in cubes and allow 
whey to rise. Strain.

Dietetic and hygienic treatment is the idea! 
method of caring for the human body. If used 
regularly and continuously it would not only help 
to correct such conditions as have been mentioned, 
but would become a vital factor in the prevention 
of disease. 

MENUS FOR ANEMIC PATIENTS 

Breakfast Stew^ed prunes, puffy omelet, oatmeal 

and cream, cream toast. 

Food Arranged According to Per Cent of Iron — 

Puffy omelet, stewed prunes, oatmeal and cream, 
cream toast. 

Dinner Baked potato, escalloped spinach, may- 
onnaise dressing, boiled mutton chop, combination 
salad, graham bread, chocolate bread pudding. 

Escalloped Spinach — I can cooked spinach, 2 
cups dry bread crumbs, Yl cup meat stock, 4 
hard cooked eggs, 1 J/2 cups sauce made v^ith meat 
stock, buttered crumbs, 1 tablespoon lemon juice. 
Drain spinach and chop. Soak bread crumbs in 
J/2 cup meat stock and add to spinach. Cut hard 
cooked eggs in small pieces. Butter a shallow bak- 
ing dish, put in layer of spinach and bread crumbs, 
then layer of eggs. Cover with sauce. Continue 
in this order until dish is nearly filled. Cover with 



buttered crumbs. Bake in hot oven until crumbs 
are brown. 

Chocolate Bread Pudding — 2 cups stale bread 
crumbs, 3 cups hot milk, I J/^ squares chocolate, 
2/3 cup sugar, 2 eggs, J4 teaspoonful salt. Soak 
bread in hot milk. Melt chocolate in pan over 
hot water, and add to bread and milk. Beat 
eggs, add sugar, salt and vanilla. Add to first 
mixture. Pour into buttered pan. Set in dish 
of hot water and bake in moderate oven until iirm. 

III. TUBERCULOSIS 

Tuberculosis is a disease in which treatment is 
almost wholly dietetic and hygenic. 

The appetite must be watched closely. Oil is 
given to afford an easily assimilated basis for re- 
newed organic growth. 

A change of climate sometimes stimulates the 
appetite, but unless it does, it is of little benefit. 

Diet 

Soups — Oyster, mutton, chicken or clam broth, 
barley, rice, bean, cream of celery or tomato, beef 
tea, peptonied milk gruel. 

Fish Fresh fish broiled or boiled, oysters or 

clams. 

Meat Roast beef, mutton, lamb chops, bacon, 

poultry, game, steaks. 

Fats Butter and salad oils used abundantly. 

Eggs Except fried. 

Farinaceous — Cream of wheat, oatmeal, hominy, 
rice, cornbread, milk toast, muffins, biscuit. 

Vegetables Potatoes, spinach, onions, aspira- 

gus, peas, tomatoes, string beans, lettuce. 

Desserts — Apple pudding, custards stewed fruits, 
rice, tapioca with fresh cream. 

Beverages Milk, cocoa, chocolate, v^ater, but- 
termilk, cream. 

Avoid fried foods, hash, gravies, veal, pork, 
cabbage, turnips, cucumbers, pies, pastry, candy. 

IV. RHEUMATISM 
Suggestions 

Use starch and sugar moderately. Avoid the 
over-use of protein food. 

The patient should partake of water freely to 
assist in eliminating the v^aste products from the i 
body. Lemonade and mineral waters are recom- 'i 
mended.

dish and bake twenty minutes in moderate oven. 

V. DIABETES 

The disease is characterized by grape sugar in 
the urine on an ordinary diet, and is hereditary 
in one-third of all cases. 

The most effective treatment is dietetic and 
hygienic. 

TREATMENT 
Preventive Treatment 

Where distinct heredity is feared, exposure to 
cold and wet, all excitement of the nervous system 
as well as indulgence in alcohol and sweets should 
be avoided. 

It is necessary in all cases to use great caution 
in regard to diet and general hygiene. 
Avoid: 

Shocks and blows affecting the nervous system. 

Injuries to the back of the head and blows over 
the liver. 

Elxposure to cold, wet and fatigue. 

Emotional strain and anxiety. 

Over-indulgence in starchy foods. 

Alcoholism. 

Dietetic Treatment 
I. Foods Allowed in Diabetes: 

1 . Soups and broths made of meat of any kind 
without vegetables. 

2. Crustaceous foods, crabs, lobsters, shrimp. 

3. Fresh fish of all kinds.

Patient should guard against taking cold and 
when possible should live in a moderately warm 
climate. Flannels should be worn next the skin 
in winter, and the body should be kept warm, for 
there is less heat producing power than nor- 
mally because of the lack of starches and sugar. 

The skin should be maintained in good condi- 
tion by frequent baths and massage. Only a mod- 
erate amount of exercise should be taken, but this 
should be in the open air. 

VI. OBESITY 
Diet to Regulate Weight 
Special Rules: 

1 . Eat slowly, masticate thoroughly. 

2. Do not have more than three courses or 
five kinds of food at any one meal. 

3. Eat moderately, not to satisfy. — Thompson.

VII. UNDERWEIGHT 
Tlie man who said, "It doea not matter so much 
what kind of a disease the body has, as the kind 
of a body the disease has/* expressed the gener- 
ally accepted idea that the normally behaved body 
is more nearly able to resist disease. The body 
that meets the requirements with regard to weight 
is likely to have greater power to resist disease. 
The above table gives the relation between height, 
age and weight and serves as a guide in feeding 
the family. 

Suggestive List of Foods to Increase Weight 

Butter, cream, olive oil, bacon, baked potatoes, 
well cooked cereals, well baked bread, chocolate, 
cocoa, milk, cream soups, cream toast, custards, 
eggs, apples, raisins, prunes, figs, dates, oranges. 

Minered Giving Vegetables 
Lettuce, celery, radishes, cabbage, spinach, 
cauliflower, turnips, tomatoes, carrots, parsnips. 

The fats and carbohydrates are especially im- 
portant as flesh builders, but the minerals given 
by the non-starchy vegetables are equally impor- 
tant, in that they help to maintain the normal 
activity of the body.

CARE OF THE NOSE AND THROAT 

The nose, mouth and throat are the gateways through which disease germs 
enter the body. Keep nostrils, mouth and throat clean and free from germs that 
breed disease. An antiseptic wash for the nose, mouth and throat should be reg- 
ularly used. The germs of cold and grippe, diphtheria, croup, scarlet fever and 
other diseases may find lodgment in these gateways of the body if you do not 
keep them in a sanitary condition. 

Spraying the nose and throat with an antiseptic douche will go a long ways 
toward warding off diseases, many of which enter the system through these or- 
gans. In Rigg's disease of the gums, poisonous germs of the mouth and throat in- 
fect the gums, and these should be rendered harmless by a germicidal wash. 
Bronchitis, pneumonia, rheumatism, appendicitis and other serious ailments may 
result from germs lodged in the nostrils, mouth or throat. 

A little vaseline or preparation of camphor and menthol rubbed into the nos- 
trils every night before retiring and again before going out in the morning will 
do a great deal toward preventing colds and will also prevent the formation of ad- 
hesions of hard mucous matter in the nose. 

COLDS AND SIGNS OF COLDS 

Snuffing and sneezing, a person with a cold is exceedingly miserable — an ob- 
ject of pity, but unless care is exercised he will have company in his misery. Colds 
are contagious and careless sneezing and coughing scatter cold germs to be breathed 
in by other unfortunates and start more colds. 

When you develop a cold it means that cold germs have begun to grow in 
your nose and throat and produce poisons that are absorbed into your body and 
give you that peculiar, miserable feeling that only a cold can produce. 

The best way to keep from catching cold is to accustom yourself to sudden 
changes of temperature. This can be done by taking a cold sponge bath over the 
back and front of your chest every morning. Next best is to avoid draughts. Keep 
the feet dry and escape the chill which causes congestion in the nose, throat and 
chest. Also avoid crowds, people who carelessly cough and sneeze, and hot, poorly 
ventilated rooms. 

To break up a cold take a hot drink at bed time and a strong laxative. Fresh 
air day and night is the best tonic in the world. If a cold hangs on for a month or 
longer be examined by your physician. It may mean the saving of much trouble 
and sickness. 

Preventions — Colds can be easily prevented if care is taken to avoid these things 
which lower the resistance of the body, and if one pays special attention to building up the 
resistance of the body. How important this is may be seen in the fact that athletes in 
training seldom, if ever, contract colds. 

How, then, are we to know that a cold is impending? First of all, in most cases 
there is a feeling of chilliness and slight feverishness. The head also feels stuffy and full ; 
the mucous linings of the nose and throat feel dry and parched, due to congestion at these 
points. Frequently there is a feeling of languor, and an "aching" of the bones, especially 
at the joints. Headache is often present, and lack of appetite, bad breath and coated tongue 
almost invariably. TTie victim is usually constipated. 

397 



398 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK-^ecUon VII— FAMILY DOCTOR. HEALTH 

Respiration — Winter colds bear a very close relation to respiration; indeed, many peo- 
ple testify to warding off colds by deep breathing, and one remedy for catarrh consists 
solely of breathing exercises. Any cold means congestion. A cold in the head means the 
presence of acute inflammation of the membrane lining the nose, generally an infection 
caused by germs gaining access to the tissues. During undue or unaccustomed exposure 
to cold the smaller blood vessels are contracted, consequently less blood is brought to the 
surface, resistance weakens, and the germs can attack, more easily. Disregarding the 
weather conditions, the outsire air is alwrays preferable to the room atmosphere. 

Good respiration will counteract this. A full breath quickens circulation; the rich 
blood, purified by the extra amount of good air in the lungs, races along, expands the tiny 
blood vessels, and sends a glow of warmth over the body. The work of the germs is can- 
celed. The next time you go out and feel the chill wind strike through you, and you start 
to hunch up your shoulders and contract your chest to get rid of the shivers, stop I Throw 
your head up, assume the correct standing posture with chest out and weight well forward. 
For a second you will shiver. Then take a deep breath, expanding your lungs to the ut- 
most of their capacity and exhale slowly. Always remember to breathe through your nose. 
The nose serves to warm and moisten the air so that it will not irritate the delicate struc- 
ture of the lungs. Now start walking forward briskly, swing your arms easily, and breathe 
as deeply as you can. 

First Aid — Under the heading of "Things to Do for a Cold," a bulletin of the Life 
Extension Institute of New York City condenses into a table these valuable hints on emer- 
gency treatment: 

"On first sign of a cold, a hot foot bath lasting half an hour, and a drink of hot lem- 
onade — or, better still, hot flavored tea (one-half ounce of whole flaxseed to a pint of boil- 
ing water, flavored with lemon peel or licorice root) will often break its force." 

"A brisk purge is also advisable." 

"A mild menthol-oil spray may be used occasionally in nose and throat." 

"Neck and chest and nostrils may be rubbed with camphorated oil." 

"If the throat is sore a gargle or spray of peroxide of hydrogen, one part to three parts 
of water, may be used." 

"Also cold compresses to the neck, or gauze pads saturated with equal parts of alcohol 
and water." 

"An alcohol rub-down is also good as a first-aid measure. Used externally alcohol is 
a real friend; internally, it is a dangerous enemy." 

"The spread of septic sore throat and other germ diseases by milk is very common. 
Pasteurised milk is safest during epidemics." 

"If there is severe headache, face ache, earache, pain in the chest, sore throat, or high 
fever, there should be no delay in calling a physician." 

Home-made Cough Synip — Here is a formula for a home-made cough syrup that ia 
highly recommended: One ounce each of horehound and licorice, two ounces of gum ara- 
bic, one pound of molasses and one teacupful of vinegar. Boil the horehound in a quart 
of water, dissolve the licorice and gum arabic in a little water first. Strain the horehound 
before adding the other ingredients. Now add the molasses and last of all the vinegar 
when it is nearly done. 

LA GRIPPE 

La Grippe, or Influenza, which often starts with a simple cold, is quite dif- 
ferent from a cold, and it is very important to distinguish between them. The after 
effects of La Grippe are often very serious. 



t: 



FAMILY DOCTOR. HEALTH— NOSE AND THROAT 399 

It starts, like a simple cold, with sneezing, coughing and fever, with com- 
plaint of a headache and a feeling of soreness in the muscles, so that one will say 
his "bones ache." He will complain of sore throat and languidness. 

The patient must be put to bed — and kept there until all symptoms have dis- 
appeared. La Grippe can usually be recognized by the fever, which is higher than 
that of a simple cold, and by the cough, which is rather rare at the beginning of 
any other kind of cold, and most especially by the fact that the patient feels really 
sick and prostrated and his "bones ache." 

La Grippe is caused by a distinct germ, which gains access through the nose 
and throat. If the germ reaches the lungs it may cause pneumonia or bronchitis; 
in the joints, they become painful and swollen with a type of inflammatory rheu- 
matism; if the germ reaches the heart it may cause severe heart disease. 

A person catches La Grippe from others who have it. The patient must be 
quarantined. The secretion from the nose, what he coughs up from the throat, 
and the practice of sneezing into the open air instead of a handkerchief, transmit 
the disease. 

La Grippe usually starts with a hard, dry cough, without any expectoration, 
and this may persist for weeks. Nausea and vomiting may occur and occasionally 
diarrhoe. The fever varies greatly, often from normal to 1 04 in one day, and may 
last, or come and go for weeks. 

Remedy — When an acute cold develops it is best to put the patient to bed on the chance 
that La Grippe germs may be there. Begin with the usual treatment for a simple cold. If 
a cough and fever develop it is probably La Grippe and a physician should be called at once. 

Quinine probably hastens the control of any recovery from La Grippe better than any 
other remedy; bromo-quinine is better than the sulphate; patient should be put to bed and 
encouraged to sleep. The cough, if severe, may require a sedative but this should be given 
only by a physician. A mustard plaster on chest will usually help the cough. 

The most important caution is that the patient be kept in bed until all the symptoms 
have been dispelled. The patient will probably remain weak and amaemic, in which case 
tonics should be given. 

Keep the bowels open both during the course of the disease and afterwards, and take 
"good care" of the health for several months; germs may remain in the system and rein- 
fect, if resistance is lowered. Unfortunately one attack does not leave one immune to that 
disease.

ONE OR TWO CHILDREN'S TROUBLES 



German Measles — Rare in children under two years of age; no relation to 
ordinary measles; one attack does not protect from another. The rash spreads 
rapidly over the body downwards; it appears in single red pin-point spots, not in 
groups or patches, as in regular measles. The child is not very sick, only slight 
fever, if any, and watering of the nose and eyes, as with a cold. 

Isolate the child for a week after eruption appears and guard against cold, as 
bronchitis is possible. For specific treatment follow advice of a physician. While 
it is not a serious disease there may be uncommon symptoms or development and 
it should be taken properly in hand. 

CHICKEN POX 



The eruption usually appears in pimples widely 
scattered over the body, scalp and face, occa- 
sionally groups of several together. The pimples 
become blisters very soon, and scabs follow. Pus 
may form under the scabs. New pimples appear 
as old ones dry. There is a great deal of itching 
but scratching or rubbing only makes it worse 
and leaves scars afterwards, somewhat like small- 



pox scars. There is some fever. 

It is very contagious. Isolate patient and call a 
physician, who will apply antiseptic and cooling 
ointments that will heal and disinfect and at the 
same time allay the itching so that the child can 
resist the impulse to scratch. Isolation necessary 
for about three weeks. 



ADENOIDS 



This is a small tonsillar structure back of the 
nose in the throat 15 it is enlarged or diseased, 
in children or adults, it should be removed. Only 
a physician, of course, can do this. Signs of 
trouble here, however, to give warning, are as 
follow^s: 

Restlessness at night, mouth breathing, snoring, 
bad general health and nervousness, or indolent, 



inactive mind and poor memory. Frequent head 
colds, nasal discharge becoming chronic, earache 
or inflammation of ears; any or all, or two or three 
of the above symptoms together may indicate ade- 
noids, and one should have the patient examined 
by a competent physician at once. The disease 
is one of childhood, in that the tonsils usually waste 
away after the age of puberty. 



TONSILS 



Enlarged or diseased tonsils cause catarrh and 
sore throat, and when any of such symptoms ap- 
pear, therefore, a physician should be consulted 



and make an examination. Diseased tonsils cause 
remote diseases w^hich obtain access by infection, 
and especially pave the way to rheumatism. 



VACCINATION 



Vaccination time is best when a baby is three to 
six months of age, unless he is delicate or has 
skin diseases. Consult physician as to suitable 
time. About three weeks will see vaccination 
through; it is rare that it is severe in its effects, 
and in any event you can rest assured that for 
one with which vaccination goes a little hard, small 
pox would have been most severe and particularly 



dangerous, and is therefore all the more fortunate- 
ly averted. 

If vaccination does not take it must be repeated; 
it is very rare that it will not finally succeed. One 
should be revaccinated every six years. If an epi- 
demic of small pox appears every one who has 
not been recently vaccinated successfully should 
have it done at once.

HOME REMEDIES IN A NUTSHELL 



Colds for Children — Molasses, stewed, with 
castor oil added, is palatable and an excellent first 
aid remedy. 

Poultices — Wormwood and arnica for sprains 
and bruises. Steep the herbs in water; add corn- 
meal to thicken. 

Linseed — Stir it into hot water — for inflamma- 
tion. 

Hop Poultice — Boil hops in hot water, add corn- 
meal, mustard and ginger. 

Bread and Milk Poultice — To make a bread 
poultice break a quantity of coarse bread crumbs, 
not crusts, in a heated bowl and cover with boiling 
water. Place a plate over the bowl till the water 
has been soaked up by the bread; strain off the 
water and put the water-soaked bread in a flannel 
bag. 

Emergency Flash Light — Keep a small flash light 
hung on the inside of the door to your medicine 
cabinet, and use it to prevent taking of wrong 
medicine by mistake. It is also far more conven- 
ient than turning on and off electric lights as one 
moves around the house at night waiting on one 

who is sick and less likely to disturb or wake the 

patient. 

Accidents — Disinfectants — In the last analysis, 
disinfectant washes simmer down principally to 

three: iodine, lysol, and hot water especially hot 

water. One should have on hand always iodine 
and lysol, with apparatus for making water hot 
at once. We might add carron oil, for burns. 

A Stopper Hint — When putting a stopper into 
a bottle always give it a half turn round after it is 
in. This will prevent it from sticking. 

Back and Chest Plaster — For backache and pain 
in the chest a belladonna and capsicum plaster is 
advisable; can be obtained at all drug stores. 

Mustard a Cure-All — Mustard is the nearest ap- 
proach to a univerasl cure-all. Few pains will 
not give way before a mustard plaster, and a wide 
range of internal inflammations from colds and 
other causes may be stopped by its timely appli- 
cation. It is the first best resort in threatened 
pneumonia, congestion of the lungs or undeter- 
mined cold on the chest. 

A Mustard Ointment is made as follows; three 
tablespoonfuls of mutton taIlo^v, 2 tablespoonfuls 
of goose or hen's oil, 1 tablespoonful of spirits of 
camphor, 2 tablespoonfuls of ammonia, I table- 
spoonful of ground mustard; mix and put in a 
covered glass jar. 

Rub over the lungs and throat or on any sprain 
or hurt when the skin is not broken. 



The Efficient Borax — Borax is an efficient and 
ever-present remedy for many ills, and owing to 
its inexpensiveness, it is within the reach of the 
housewife of most limited means. Applied locally 
on linen, it has been found to be a remarkable 
cure for erysipelas; for catarrhal difficulties it will 
give relief if snuffed in the nostrils, making a 
solution of one dram of borax to one-half pint of 
soft water; as a gargle it benefits sore throats; for 
weak and inflamed eyes it proves desirable as a 
wash. 

Cure for Fever Blisters — Carbolic acid, 6 drops; 
glycerine, I teaspoonful; rosewater, 10 drops. 



Ivy Poisoning Tansy tea, made good and 

strong; wash affected parts frequently, and drink 
some three or four times a day. Make it nice and 
fresh for every drink. It is blood cooling and 
purifying and it makes one less susceptible to the 
poison. 

Macaroni "Straw" — A stick of macaroni will 
serve in place of a glass tube for a patient who can- 
not sit up to drink, or will sometimes induce a 
child to drink its milk when otherwise it would 
not. 

Oranges and Lemons — Oranges possess a spe- 
cial value in lung diseases, the acid (citrate of 
potash) tending to prevent pneumonia. They are 
a good laxative, if three or four are taken daily. 
They are said to destroy the craving for alcoholic 
stimulants. 

Lemons contain citric acid, which combines with 
alkalis and circulates in the blood as alkaline salts. 
Hence lemons make blood and urine less acid, or 
rather more alkaline — blood never becomes acid 
in life. 

For Over-Fatigue Hot milk heated to as high 

a temperature as it can be drunk is a most re- 
freshing stimulant in cases of cold or over-fatigue. 
Its action is very quick and grateful. It gives 
real strength as well as acting as a food. 

Court Plaster — Before using a piece of court 
plaster prick it all over with a fine needle. This 
prevents the usual unpleasant drawing sensation. 

To Prevent a Blue Bruise — If sweet oil is ap- 
plied to the skin after a blow or bruise it wriil not 
turn blaclc and blue. 

Castor Oil for Wounds — Castor oil is an ad- 
mirable dressing for slight abrasions, burns and 
minor wounds. First wash wound with some anti- 
septic solution or paint with tincture of iodine 
and then cover vfith gauze saturated with castor 
oil.

Sugar and Salt for Wounds — Sugar is used as 
a dressing for infected wounds on the European 
battle fields, and with good results. The British 
Government has found that wounded men on ships, 
whose injuries have been washed with common 
sea water, make better recoveries than those treat- 
ed in field hospitals, the conclusion being that the 
salt waters of the ocean are an ideal antiseptic. 

Ptomaine Poisoning — Treatment: Castor oil, at 
first; starvation; heat applied to abdomen to relieve 
pain; more castor oil, at last. 

Garlic for Wounds — Garlic applied to a wound 
stops the infection and heals quickly, whereas 
many modern antiseptics used in fashionable prac- 
tice injure the tissues. Garlic has been tested thor- 
oughly at the Paddington Infirmary in London, 
England, as vrell as in field hospitals in France. 

An old French peasant woman -was found to 
have dressed the sores and wounds of soldiers 
in the war zone with remarkable results. An army 
surgeon investigated, and garlic is now^ sold by 
the ton where it was formerly sold by the ounce 
in English chemists* shops. Garlic juice, diluted 
with three or four parts of distilled water, seems to 
be the standard dressing. 

Ointment for Eczema — Pulverized zinc oxide 
and amyl, J/2 ounce each, vaseline, I ounce; for 
local use. Apply to parts affected and wrap 
with a cloth. Wear rubber coat or kid fingers 
from gloves. Do not bathe eczema spots for 
three days after applying paste, but keep spots cov- 
ered w^ell with paste. 

For a Burn — Apply equal parts of white of egg 
and olive oil mixed together, then cover with a 
piece of old linen. 

Or hold burned portion of the skin over heat. 

Or apply at once cooking soda, then cover with 
cloth and keep same wet with cold water. 

Nose Bleed — When the nose is bleeding never 
hold it over a basin or hold the head down in 
any way. This only causes further rush of blood 
to the broken tissue in the nose. The head should 
be held up and back, the flow being caught in a 
handkerchief or cloth. 

One of the most effective and simple means of 
checking nose-bleed is to press on the upper lip. 
Near the under surface of the lip runs the artery 
that supplies the interior nasal passages where 
the ruptures occur. If this is pressed, the flow 
of blood is mechanically checked, thus allowing 
the blood around the broken tissues to congeal and 
seal up the opening. 

If merely pressing with the finger does not suc- 
ceed, place a vfad of paper under the lip and fold 
the lip over it, holding it down tight. 



As a further remedy for nose bleeding, if pro- 
longed, a little powdered alum may be placed 
within the nostrils. Above all, absolute rest and 
quiet is enjoined. Do not blow the nose at any 
cost. Allow the blood to fill up the nostrils and 
wait for the coagulation to occur. The overflow 
will undoubtedly find its way into the mouth, which 
may easily be cleared away. 

There is always a cause for nose bleeding, and 
a specialist should be consulted for correct diag- 
nosis and condition treated. Cases of nose bleed- 
ing are on record that could not be controlled, 
resulting in exsanguination. 

Bran Baths for Nervousness — One of the best 
aids for the nervous woman who is trying to re- 
duce her fractious nerves, is the bran bath just be- 
fore retiring at night. This not only has a sooth- 
ing effect, but incidentally softens and whitens the 
skin. 

To make the bath, buy ordinary bran at a feed 
store and keep it in a tin box away from mice. 
Make a bag of cheesecloth, from 12 to 18 inches 
square, and stuff it with bran, until about as full 
as a pine pillow. This bag is put in a bathtub 
half filled with warm w^ater, and squeezed until 
the water is brown and bubbly. It is not well 
to remain in the water longer than five or six 
minutes; if possible, the bather should rest ten 
minutes and then be massaged. If there is no one 
to do the massaging rub the body thoroughly 
with a rough towel or knead it with the hands. 

Insomnia Remedies — There are two very simple 
but effective remedies for the kind of sleeplessness 
that comes from overwork or nervous exhaustion. 
One is to have the feet very warm. Put them 
against a rubber bag filled with hot water, vrhich 
is better than an earthen bottle as it will retain 
the heat for hours. The second method is sim- 
pler. Discard the pillow, turn over and lie on 
the stomach with hands clasped under the fore- 
head to lift the head a trifle. This vrill often send 
one to sleep. 

When you are tired and nervous, a good rubbing 
all over the body with the following lotion will be 
very restful; diluted alcohol six ounces, cologne 
water six ounces, tannin ten grains. Lie quietly in 
bed after the rubbing for half an hour. 

The Tired Feeling — Much fatigue, otherwise 
not readily accounted for, is unquestionably owing 
to over-eating, especially of protein foods such as 
beans, cheese, etc., which do not fully digest and 
consequently leave poisons in the system. 

To Reduce Superfluous Flesh — Deep breathing 
is essential and may be practiced almost anywhere 
in the open air, although of course you can obtain 
the greatest benefit from this exercise when you 
can wear a loose garment that will allow absolute 



FAMILY DOCTOR, HEALTH— HOUSE REMEDIES 



405 



freedom of the muscles. When practicing deep 
breathing indoors stand by an open window and 
accompany your breathing with a simple arm ex- 
ercise. 

The process of reducing by means of exercise is 
a far saner method than that of using hot baths, 



for the exercise strengthens the muscles and may 
be applied to only those parts of the anatomy that 
need the treament; while the baths reduce the 
weight of the entire body and have no strengthen- 
ing effect.

THE HUMAN MACHINE 

(Iowa State College Bulletin No. 3) 

THE CELL 

The unit of the body is the single cell, the knowledge of which 
need not be entirely through the imagination, as a close counterpart of 
this unit cell exists in nature. The school boy, who explores the con- 
tents of the stagnant pool, sometimes gathers one of these microscopic 
celb into his tin can which he uses to scoop up pollyw^ogs from 
the pond. He does not see the cell until his teacher puts a drop 
of water under the microscope. Sometimes after doing this she sees a little jelly-like 
mass under the cover glass. This mass moves about and presently after stretch- 
ing out a portion of itself into an arm-like shape, it gathers in a morsel of food. The 
jelly-like mass, called the ameba, is the lowest form of animal life and closely re- 
sembles one single cell of the body. 

The one cell of the ameba performs all the necessary functions of its life 
processes. It must in turn act as arms, means of locomotion, and digestive sys- 
tem. The results are elementary, because the facilities for work are most elemen- 
tary. There are no specialized forces and consequently no high type of life. The 
human body occupies a position of the strongest contrast to this simple one-celled 
creature and it owes its high position in the scale of life, to the fact that there is 
every provision for specialized activities and for perfect cooperation between the 
organs that perform those activities. The millions of cells that make up the body 
are so formed, so grouped and so related as to fit each cell and each class of cells 
for its special work. 

POSITION AND STRUCTURE OF ORGANS 

Body Cavities — The body is divided into two cavities by means of a tough membrane 
called the diaphragm. The upper cavity is called the thoreix. The lower cavity is called 
the abdominal cavity. 

I. Organs of Respiration 

These organs are located entirely within the chest cavity or thorax. 

The thorax is lined with muscles which have an inner lining of a delicate membrane 
called the pleura. 



407 



408 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK — Section VIII — Personal Hygiene and Person 



The trachea is a tube which connects the nasal passages with the lungs. It is made 
up of a series of cartilaginous rings which are connected by means of muscles. 

The right and left bronchi branch from the lower end of the trachea to the right and 
left lung. The bronchi are like the trachea in structure and they, with their many branches, 
form a net work of tubes through the lungs. Each tube leads to a small cell or air chamber. 
The spaces between the tubes and air cells are filled in by connective tissue, which joins all 
parts of the lungs into a spongy mass of tissue. The whole is given stability by the tough 
cartilage in the bronchi that extend through the lungs. 

II. Organs of Digestion 

The digestive system begins with the teeth and extends through the entire body. It is 
really one long tube called the alimentary canal. The chief subdivisions of the system are, 
mouth, stomach, intestines. 

The mouth consists of lips, teeth, tongue* and palate (roof of the mouth). The mouth 
leads direcdy into the pharynx, which lies directly back of the trachea. The pharynx is 
the upper part of the long tube called the oesophagus. The oesophagus is connected with the 
pharynx at its upper extremity and with the stomach at its lower extremity. The oesoph- 
agus is a muscular tube. It is located midway between the right and left side of the body 
lies directly back of the trachea. 

The stomach is a muscular bag lined with a mucous membrane. It lies directly below 
the diaphragm and to the left side of the body. 

The mucous membrane which lines the stomach contains many glands which supply 
the digestive fluids. The capacity of the stomach is about three pints. 

The narrower end of the stomach joins the small intestine at the right side of the 
body, directly back of the liver. This opening of the stomach into the intestines is called 
the pylorus. 

The small intestine is a tube-like organ composed of muscle and lined v«th a delicate 
membrane. It occupies the middle portion of the abdominal cavity and lies directly below 
the stomach. The many folds of the small intestines are attached to the body wall by 
means of a membrane called the mesentery. 

The small intestines join the large intestines at the lower part of the abdominal cav- 
ity on the right side of the body. The appendix is attached just below this point. 

The large intestine extends up the right side, across the abdominal cavity, just below 
the stomach and down the left side of the abdominal cavity. 

The mucous lining of the intestines contains glands which produce digestive fluids. 

The pancreas and liver are glands which supply digestive fluids, which are poured into 
the intestines. These fluids and their uses wil be studied in a following lesson. 

III. Organs of Circulation 

The heart is a muscular organ located in the central part of the chest cavity, between 
the lungs. It is slig'htly nearer to the left than the right side of the body. It is just above 
the diaphragm. 

The heart consists of right and left sides, which are entirely separate compartments. 
Each side consists of a large chamber called the ventricle and a small chamber called (he 
auricle. The ventricles are provided with a very strong muscular wall. 

The valves are little trap doors which control the direction of the flow of blood. TTiey 
are located between the auricles and ventricles and between the ventricles and arteries. 

The arteries are muscular tubes that carry blood from the heart to all organs of the 
body. The veins are muscular tubes that carry blood from the organs to the heart. The 
veins have little pocket-like valves. 



PERSONAL HYGIENE AND PERSON— THE HUMAN MACHINE 409 

IV. Organs of Excretion 

The skin, which covers the entire body, is composed of three layers: The outer layer, 
called the epidermis, is the tough, protective layer. The second layer, or dermis, contains 
the blood vessels which feed the skin. The under layer consists of a loose tissue and con- 
tains the glands which secrete the perspiration. This secretion is conducted to the surface 
of the skin by means of tubes that extend from the gland to the surface of the skin and 
deposit the secretion through the pores of the skin. 

The lungs are active as excretory organs. Their structure has been considered under 
respiration. 

The kidneys are bean-shaped glands. The center of the kidney is a basin called the 
pelvis. Opening into this pelvis are great numbers of ducts which end in small cavities 
which secrete the urine. The secretion is carried by the ducts to the pelvis of the kidney, 
and from the pelvis through a long tube called the ureter to the urinary bladder. 

The intestines are provided w^ith a strong layer of muscles which contract and force 
the wastes from the body. This makes the intestines very important organs of excretion. 

V. Protection 

The skin covers the delicate parts of the body and prevents the entrance of harmful 
material and organisms. 

The bony frame work of the body gives the body its shape and stability and protects 
the delicate organs from injury. 

The bone is fed by means of a tough covering called the periosteum. This membrane 
contains many blood vessels which feed the bone through its spongy surface. The process 
of feeding is aided by the fact that the bones are hollow and are filled vsrith marrow. The 
bone is provided with a system of canals or tubes which conduct food throughout the en- 
tire bone. 

The organs of the chest cavity are protected by the spine, ribs, clavicle, sternum and 
scapula. 

The spine consists of 33 bones called vertebrae. These bones are separated by masses 
of spongy bones. They are bound together by strong tissue called ligaments. The ribs are 
flexible bones which have the front ends attached to the sternum and the back ends at- 
tached to the spine. 

The scapula is the broad, flat bone called the shoulder blade. 

The clavicle is the collar bone. It is attached to the sternum in front and to the sca- 
pula at the back. 

The brain and other organs of the head are protected by the skull which is made up of 
separate bones. The frontal occupies the front part of the head, the two temporal bones 
are directly above and back of the ears, the occipital bone is located between and below the 
temporal bones, the two parietal bones are located between the temporal bones and above 
the occipital bones. 

The organs of the abdominal cavity are protected by the spine, the ribs and the pelvis. 
The pelvis is a strong arch-shaped bone. It is attached to the spine. It curves up and to- 
ward the front, forming a sort of basin which supports the organs of the abdominal cavity. 

The nervous system sends its branches to every part of the body and serves as pro- 
tection because it gives warning of danger. The blind man feels the presence of the stove 
through the nerves of sensation, and avoids being burned. 

VI. Organs of Stimulation 

The chief organ of stimulation is the brain. The brain consists of a fore-brain called 
the cerebrum and the hind-brain. The hind-brain is made up of the cerebellum which is 
at the extreme back of the head, the pons varoli, which is directly under the cerebellum 



410 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK — Section VIII — Personal Hygiene and Person 

and the medulla oblongata, which joins the Spinal cord. The medulla oblongata is also 
known as the bulb. 

The outer covering of the brain is a tough membrane which conforms to the many 
convolutions of the brain. The%e convolutions are a striking example of the economy of 
nature. Much of the brain surface has been stored away in the skull because of these con- 
volutions. 

The spinal cord is a tube having thick, protective walls. It is composed of white and 
gray matter just as the brain is. The spinal cord joins the brain just below the bulb (or 
medulla oblongata) and occupies the central cavity of the spinal column. The spinal column 
protects this delicate organ from injury. The spinal cord sends out nerve branches to all 
parts of the body. 

VII. Organs of Activity 

Motion — ^The bones of the body are so constructed as to aid motion. The fact that 
they are hollow makes them light, gives them added strength, and prevents shock to the 
organs of the body. 

The bones are provided with joints to suit each purpose. The head is attached by a 
pivot joint, because it is necessary to turn the head in all directions. The elbow has a com- 
bination of hinge and pivot joints. 

The upper arm and the upper leg are attached by ball and socket jonts which allow 
them to move freely. Hinge joints, which allow free motion backward and forward, are 
located at the wrist, knee and ankle. 

The joints are held in position by means of tough cords called tendons. 

The bones are covered with layers of tough muscle that contract and expand when they 
are stimulated by the nerves which lie within the muscles. 

Speech — ^The larynx is the upper end of the trachea. It is composed of tough walls 
of cartilage. The vocal cords are tough muscular cords which are stretched across the lar- 
ynx. As the air is forced over these cords, they are caused to vibrate. The vibration causes 
the sound. The hard palate acts as a sounding board and intensifies this sound. The mus- 
cles of the lips and tongue contract and help to formulate the sound into speech. The teeth 
help to retain the sound, and are an aid in the process of speech. 

VIII. Organs of Sensation 

Sight — The eye is protected by a tough outer coat called the sclerotic coat. This is 
seen in the white of the eye. The inner coat called the choroid contains blood vessels 
which nourish the eye. It also contains black pigment whcih prevents the entrance of light 
except through the cornea. 

The cornea is the front part of the eye ball. This part of the eye is covered with the 
sclerotic coat and is transparent. It is not covered with the choroid coat. The choroid coat 
is folded back to form the iris which is the colored part of the eye. The opening in the 
iris is called the pupil which allows the rays of light to enter the eye. The pupil is pro- 
vided with muscles which contract when light is too strong. This is one of Nature's plans 
for protecting the eye. 

Directly back of the pupil of the eye, there is a lens which helps to bring the rays of 
light to a focus. The portion of the eye in front of the lens is filled with a fluid called the 
aqueous humor. The portion of the eye back of the lens is filled with a liquid called the 
vitreous humor. These liquids act with the lens in bringing the rays of light to a focus. 

The inner coat of the eye is called the retina. It contains the fibres of the optic nerve 
and is the sensitive plate for the rays of light. The optic nerve branches out from the re- 
tina and connects with the visual center of the brain. 

Hearing — ^The sense of hearing is due to the vibration of sound waves upon the tympa- 
num which is a tough membrane that is stretched across the opening between the outer and 



PERSONAL HYGIENE AND PERSON— THE HUMAN MACHINE 411 

inner ear. The outer ear collects the sound waves and conducts them to the tympanum and 
then on into the inner ear. 

The inner ear consists of a chamber which contains three small bones called the anvil, 
stirrup and hammer. Sound waves are picked up by this chain of bones and carried through 
a sort of spiral chamber to the cochlea. The inner ear stands in relation to sound just as the 
retina does to sight. It is the sensitive surface that picks up the sound waves and conducts 
them to the auditory nerve. The fibers of the auditory nerve lie in the inner ear and branch 
out into the auditory nerve which is connected with the brain. 

The eustachian tube connects the inner ear with the pharynx. 

Smell and Taste — The nerves of taste end in little papillae, which give the rough ap- 
pearance to the tongue. The sense of taste is conducted to the brain by the stimulation of 
the papillae and by means of the nerves of taste. 

The nerves of smell end in the same way in the nasal passages and produce the sense 
of smell. 

Position — Some physiologists consider that the sense of position is due to the fact that 
the controlling nerves end in the semi-circular canal of the ear. The change in the position 
of the fluid in this canal stimulates the connecting nerve and causes the sensation of changed 
positions. 

Hunger and Thirst, Cold and Heat — These sensations are due to the bodily conditions 
that exist at the nerve ending. The sensation is carried by the nerve to the brain. 

TTie structure of the body illustrates most clearly the value of specialized working 
forces which are perfectly cooperative and thoroughly organized into one powerful wiiole. 

THE RUNNING OF THE MACHINE 
I. Digestion of Food 

A dinner may consist of roast beef, potatoes, bread and butter, plum pudding and tea. 
How is that food digested, or in other words, changed in such a way that it can become 
a part of the body? 

In this study of digestion, begin with the bread and let that represent the whole class 
of starchy foods. The principal foods in this class are potatoes, com, rice, cereal foods of 
all kinds, all kinds of flour and foods nxjide from them, peas and beans. 

Digestion in the Mouth — The bread is thoroughly masticated by the teeth. This breaks 
it into fine particles and makes it easily dissolved. The salivary glands, which are located 
below the jaw bones and near the ears, manufacture the saliva and deposit it in the mouth. 
The flow of saliva is increased by the thorough mastication and is also stimulated by the 
flavor of the food. 

The saliva contains water which moistens the food and a substance called ptyalin which 
changes the starch to dextrine. The change to dextrine is the first step in the change of 
starch to sugar. There is a slight change to maltose. 

Digestion in the Stomach — ^The bread passes into the Sitomach and the digestion con- 
tinues until the bread becomes mixed with the acid of the stomach. After that starch can- 
not be digested in the stomach. There is very little digestion of starch in the stomach. 

Digestion in the Intestines — The bread passes from the stomach into the intestines, where 
it is acted upon by the amylopsin of the pancreatic juice. The juice is poured into the in- 
testines from the gland called the pancreas. The amylopsin changes the starchy part of the 
bread to a substance called maltose. The maltose is acted upon by the intestinal juices and 
changed to glucose and fructose, in which form it is found in the blood. 

The slice of bread has been acted upon by the teeth, saliva, amylopsin and intestinal 
juice and has now entered the blood circulation. As the glucose passes into the liver, a 
portion of it is stored away for future use in the form of glycogen. Glycogen is also stored 



4 1 2 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK — Section VIII — Personal Hygiene and Person 



in the muscles and white blood corpuscles. This supply acts as a reserve source of heat 
and is given out in the blood stream as needed. 

The dinner suggested provided roast beef. Its digestion will be considered in the 
same way. The digestion oi the roast beef represents the process of digestion for all pro- 
tein. The chief protein-giving foods are lean meat, eggs, cheese, milk, fish, peas, beans, 
macaroni. 

Digestion in the Mouth — The beef is thoroughly masticated by the teeth and is soft- 
ened by the saliva. The saliva has no power to digest protein. 

Digestion in the Stomach — ^The stomach is provided with a digestive fluid called gas- 
tric juice. The gastric juice consists of hydrochloric acid, pepsin and rennin. The acid acts 
as an antiseptic and helps to counteract the effect of harmful substances that may have en- 
tered the stomach. The rennin changes the protein of milk into a curd. Gastric juice as a 
whole is only slightly active in the digestion of protein. It does change protein to proteose 
and peptone, but only slightly. The stomach is more a storehouse for food that is waiting 
to enter the intestine, than a means of digesting food. The chief purpose of the gastric 
juice is to aid in digesting protein, converting proteids into peptones, a substance easily 
assimilable to the blood stream. 

Digestion in the Intestines — ^The pancreatic juice is a strong alkaline fluid. The action 
of the ferment called amylopsin has been studied in the digestion of the slice of bread. The 
ferment called trypsin is the active ferment in digesting protein. The mass of food which 
enters the intestine from the stomach is strongly acid. The ferment trypsin cannot act in 
an acid medium, but the strong alkali of the pancreatic juice is sufficient to neutralize the acid 
at once. The trypsin acts upon the protein and changes it to peptone and proteose. The 
pancreatic juice is aided by the intestinal juice in preparing peptones and proteose for the 
blood. The ferment of the intestinal juice breaks up the peptones and proteoses into sim- 
pler forms. The digested protein foods are taken by the cells in the form of amino acids. 

The butter and the fat of the plum pudding in the suggested dinner are digested by 
means of ferments, not yet considered, and the action of these ferments will be studied 
next. The chief fatty foods are butter, cream, olive oil, cheese and fat meats. 

Digestion in the Mouth — Fatty foods are thoroughly masticated and moistened in the 
mouth, but no digestion takes place there. 

Digestion in the Stomach — ^The fatty foods pass into the stomach and are stored there 
until they pass into the intestines; but very little digestion takes place. Fats are slightly 
emulsified in the stomach and stomach lipase has slight action upon fat. 

Digestion in the Intestines — The pancreatic juice contains a ferment called lipase. This 
ferment has the power to change fats into fatty acids and glycerin. It also splits the fat into 
small globules, making an emulsion of the fatty mass. The contents of the intestine are 
alkaline and the fatty acids combines with the alkali, making a soapy mixture very simi- 
lar to the soap which is made by heating fat and lye together.

2. Assimilation of Food 

The process of digestion has changed the food into soluble form which can be ab- 
sorbed by the tissues. The next step in the feeding of the body is the absorption of these 
foods. This takes place almost entirely in the small intestine. The surface of the small 
intestine is provided with microscopic tube-like projections called villi. The villi absorb the 
food and through the villi it is conducted into the circulation of the blood. 

Starch and Sugsu- — After starch and sugar are digested, they are absorbed and enter 
the blood as glucose. They are taken to the liver and a portion of them stored as glyco- 
gen. This supply of glycogen is given out into the blood from time to time, in the form of 
glucose. The glucose must be carried to each cell of the body and become a part of each 
cell of the body before the body receives any benefit from it. As the oxygen in the cell 
combines with the food, the blood becomes a part of the cell or is assimilated. As this proc- 
ess takes place, a gas called carbondioxide is formed. This gas is a waste that is disposed 
of by means of the lungs. 

Protein — The digested protein is absorbed by the villi of the small intestine and poured 
into the blood. The protein was changed to peptone by the gastric juice in cooperation with 
the tripsin in the pancreatic juice. The erepsin of the intestinal juice breaks the peptone 
into simpler substances which can be safely taken into the blood. 

Steps in Digestion of Protein — Proteose, peptone, peptid, amino acid. 

Fat — The digested fat is absorbed from the small intestine by means of tube-like ves- 
sels called lacteals. From the lacteals the digested fat enters the blood circulation. 

3. Circulation 

The blood is the medium for carrying food to all parts of the body and for removing 
wastes from the body. 

Structure of the Blood — The blood consists of red blood corpuscles, white blood cor- 
puscles and a fluid called plasma. The red blood corpuscles carry oxygen to the tissues of 
the body by means of the hemoglobin which they contain. The white blood corpuscles 
have a number of uses, but they are chiefly of value in removing poison from the blood. 
For this reason they are active in healing a wound. The plasma is the fluid part of the 
blood and is 90 per cent water. 

The heart is a pump which forces the blood through the body. (Study structure of 
heart in Lesson I.) 

The veins open into the auricles. The arteries open into the ventricles. (Study veins, 
arteries, auricles and ventricles in Lesson I.) It will be well to secure the heart of some ani- 
mal and to locate these organs. 

The flow of blood is regulated by means of the two sets of valves. There is a valve 
between each auricle and its connecting ventricle. There is also a valve between each ven- 
tricle and its connecting artery. 

Course of Blood — To study this take the circulation at some given point and trace the 
blood back to that point. Beginning with the left auricle, the blood flows into the left ven- 
tricle. The valve prevents the backward flow into the auricle. From the left ventricle, cer- 
tain branches of the aorta feed the head, neck, shoulders and arms. Other branches feed the 
organs of the pelvic cavity and the legs. From these organs the blood is carried by the 
veins to the right auricle, from the right auricle to the right ventricle, from the right ventri- 
cle through the lungs, from the lungs to the left auricle, from the left auricle to the left 
ventricle, and then it takes the same course through the body again. 



414 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK — Section VIII — Personal Hygiene and Person 

Importcuit — The blood which leaves the left ventricle to pass through and feed the or- 
gans of the body never reaches the left ventricle again until it has passed through the lungs. 
The lungs are the repair station for the blood. They supply the blood with fresh oxygen 
and provide an outlet for impurities. 

The nervous system stimulates the action of the muscles of the heart and thus regu- 
lates the system of circulation. The perfection of the heart action depends primarily upon 
the healthy, normal condition of the nervous system. 

4. Respiration 

The nasal passages are provided for the entrance of air into the lungs. If the air is 
taken in through the mouth, it is an indication that there is an obstruction in the nasal pas- 
sage, or that an improper method of breathing has become habitual. 

The lining of the nasal passages is covered with a hair-line growth called cilia. This 
sieve formed by the cilia helps to strain out the dust and other injurious substances and pro- 
vides a strong argument in favor of proper habits of breathing. 

The air passes from the nasal passages to all parts of the lungs, if deep, full breaths are 
taken. Proper breathing means that the ribs and the diaphragm are exercised. This can- 
not happen if the clothing is too tight. This will not happen unless the attention is called 
to the importance of long, deep breathing. It is the function of the process of respiration 
to remove the impure air from the lungs, to introduce pure air and to strengthen the controll- 
ing muscles by means of exercise. The fulfillment of this function of the body and upon a 
sufficient amount of pure air to breathe. 

Nature demands that we: 

1. Breathe deeply, exercise ribs and diaphragm. 

2. Breathe through nostrils. 

3. Hold chest high. 

4. Hold shoulders down and back. 

5. Do not handicap ribs and diaphragm by tight clothing (belts and corsets). 

6. Ventilate sleeping and living rooms. 

7. Ventilate school room. 

8. Ventilate church, lecture room, office room, factory and railway train. 

Note — Ventilate means — Provide means for the entrance of pure air and the exit of 
impure air. 

5. Excretion 

Food is taken into the body. It is acted upon by ferments and so digested. The di- 
gested portion is taken into the blood and carried to the cells of the body. These processes 
leave waste matters that interfere with the working of the organs of the body, very much 
as soot and ashes interfere with the working of a heating plant. 

Nature has foreseen this condition and has amply provided the body with means of re- 
moving these wastes. (Study organs of excretion. Lesson I.) 

The surface of the skin is covered with pores that are the opening of tube-like ducts 
that leads to the perspiratory glands in the under tissues of the skin. These glands gather 
poisonous wastes and pour them out upon the surface of the skin (chiefly carbon dioxide). 
The perspiration collected by these glands consists of water and solid matter. The evapora- 
tion of the water removes heat from the body. 

The skin and the kidneys work hand in hand. If the skin is suddenly chilled, the ac- 
tion of perspiratory glands is retarded and the kidneys become overworked. If the skin 
does its duty the kidneys are relieved. (Study structure of kidneys in Lesson I.) 

The tubules of the kidneys gather waste substances from the blood and deposit them 
into the basin of the kidney. From this it is discharged through the urinary bladder. 



PERSONAL HYGIENE AND PERSON— THE HUMAN MACHINE 415 

The amount of secretion from the kidneys is increased by the use of proteins, the use 
of water, and by exposure to cold. Water acts as a solvent for the solid constituents of 
the urine, for that reason an abnormally great secretion of urine removes too much water 
from the kidneys and thus prevents the solution of the solids in the urine. 

The lungs act as organs of excretion in that they remove carbon dioxide and other 
substances which are waste products after digestion and assimilation have been completed. 
(Study respiration, Lesson II.) 

The intestines remove the waste of digestion. The regularity and thoroughness of their 
work depend upon the care of the body. 

Foods: Foods containing cellulose give bulk to the food and help to strengthen the 
muscular lining of the intestines, because they force the muscles to push in order to force the 
food through the body. Foods like lettuce, celery, cabbage, cauliflower, onions, prunes, dates 
and rhubarb are laxative because of their bulk. Other foods like cream, butter, olive oil 
and fat meats are laxative because they are lubricants. Elxercise and ample amount of 
water and massage are also important in promoting the proper excretory function of the 
intestine. 

The body is so wisely planned that the cells are able to render harmless a certain 
amount of the poisonous wastes of the body and each of these organs in the excretory sys- 
tem have an important function to perform. Nature has planned so well that a little com- 
mon sense habitually made use of in attention to diet, ventilation, exercise, sleep, rest, cloth- 
ing and power of relaxation would make aches and pains strangers to the human family. 
Take care of the excretory organs. Give the body a thorough cleansing by means of them. 

CARE OF THE MACHINE 

The essentials of success in the management of any machine are, thorough knowledge 
of its parts and their uses, an appreciation of its value, a thorough understanding of the 
results of harmful treatment and an active conscience concerning the care of the machine. 
These essentials of success apply most vitally to the care of the human machine. Disease 
is not an accident, but failure, with reference to some of these essentials. 

This lesson will give some definite suggestion concerning the care of each system of 
the body. 

1. Organs of Digestion 

Plan the meals wisely. Make them provide the body with just food enough to sus- 
tain the body, not to destroy it. Make them provide foods to suit the age, occupation, 
climate and condition of system. Make them represent a wise amount of each of the five 
principles. (Study lesson on foods.) 

Masticate food thoroughly. This increases the flow of the digestive fluids and renders 
the food more soluble when mixed with the digestive fluids. 

Do not eat when excited, angry, anxious or over-tired. 

Experiment — A scientist introduced a piece of metal into the digestive tract of a dog 
and then studied its progress with an X-ray instrument. The metal was seen to move 
through the system very easily until the dog was made angry. At that the metal ceased 
to move. The dog was soothed and the metal moved on as at first. This illustrated the 
ill effect of overwrought feelings upon the process of digestion. 

Do not eat highly seasoned foods. Seasonings are a stimulant to the nerves of taste 
and are of value if used moderately. They also stimulate the flow of digestive fluids and 
so are of value if used moderately. The overuse of seasonings and spices weakens the nerves 
of taste and the nerves that control the flow of digestive fluids because it makes them work 
harder than nature intended them to work. Do not eat at irregular intervals. Do not eat 



4 1 6 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK — Section VIII — Personal Hygiene and Person 

a heavy meal late at night. Do not eat rich foods frequently. Do not use condensed foods 
like cheese too freely. Do not use iced drinks. Use tea and coffee moderately if at all. 
Do not fill the system with medicine. Let proper diet and proper habits of eating keep 
the body in good working order. 

2. Organs of Circulation 

Perfect circulation carries food to each cell of the body and carries away the waste 
material from each cell of the body. Perfect circulation depends upon: 

a. Elxercise in the open air. 

b. Clothing that does not restrict the organs of the body, whether the article of cloth- 

ing be collar, shoes, belt, corset or gloves. 

c. Absence of stimulating foods in the diet, whether it be too much meat, too much 

tea or coffee, or too much of highly seasoned foods. 

d. Sufficient rest and sleep. 

e. Power to keep the nerves under control and thus, to relax the muscles of the 

body. 

f. Sufficient recreation of the proper sort. Recreation is that which recreates, which 

makes as good as new. So-called recreation that does not pass that test should 
not be indulged in. 

3. Organs of Respiration 
The perfect working of these organs depend upon: 

a. Breathing through nasal passages. 

The cilia in the nasal passage sift out the dust and other solid matter that would 
act as an irritant if not as a poison to the throat and lungs. 

b. Habit of taking long, deep breaths. 

This fills each sac of the lungs with pure air and helps to remove impure gas and 
solid matter from the lungs. It also strengthens the muscles that control the 
ribs and strengthens the diaphragm. 

c. The habit of holding the body properly. 

The chest cavity is expanded by holding the chest out, the chin up and the shoul- 
ders down and back. 

d. Attention to good ventilation in homes, school, church, railway train, office and 

factory. 
The air of the room is being filled with impurities from the breath of the occu- 
pants. These impurities are taken back into the system if there is no arrange- 
ment for the exit of impure air and the entrance of pure air. Good ventilation 
is especially needed in the sleeping room and all public places. 

e. Sufficient amount of outdoor exercise. 

4. Organs of Excretion 

a. Care of organs of respiration as discussed in 3. 

b. Care of kidneys. 

A sufficient amount of water is necessary to dissolve the solid matter that accumu- 
lates in the kidneys. 

A moderate use of stimulating foods like meat, tea, coffee, spices and rich foods. 
These are too stimulating to the kidneys. 

A moderate use of sugar and starch is wise. An overuse is one of the causes of 
diabetes. 

Sufficient rest and relaxation; lack of nerve control is one of the causes of dis- 
eased kidneys. 

c. Care of the skin. 

If skin fails to do its work the kidneys are overworked and thus weakened. 



PERSONAL HYGIENE AND PERSON— THE HUMAN MACHINE 417 

d. Protection from cold. 

Severe chilling of the body prevents the skin from doing its work and thus weak- 
ens the kidneys. 

e. Removal of waste through intestines. 

The muscles of the intestines must be strengthened by exercise, just as the outer 
muscles must be strengthened. Foods which contain bulk help to strengthen 
these muscles, because it is necessary to push in order to force these foods 
through the body. Some of these laxative foods are lettuce, celery, radishes, 
onions, green corn, tomatoes, turnips, rhubarb, prunes, figs, dates, apples. Other 
foods are laxative because they are lubricants. These foods are water, butter, 
cream, olive oil, fat meats, molasses and honey. 

Exercise stimulates the action of the intestines. 

Massage strengthens the muscles and stimulates action. 

Regular habits of eating, thorough mastication, moderate use of sweets aids the 
action of the intestines in removing wastes. 

Too great stress cannot be laid upon the importance of the organs of excretion. 
Ample provision has been made by nature, but personal carelessness too often 
causes disease. Wastes that are not removed are reabsorbed by the tissues 
and act as poisons. This condition is made evident by tendency to take cold, 
frequent sore throats, headaches, rheumatism. These and other conditions in- 
dicate a debilitated condition of the system. 

5. The Nervous System 

The proper working of all of the organs of the body depends most vitally upon the 
condition of the nervous system, since all stimulus to activity, whether it be digestion, cir- 
culation, respiration, excretion, sensation or thought, comes from the nervous system. The 
care of the nervous system must, in the first place, take proper food into consideration. 
Foods that are too stimulating, like tea, coffee, meat and highly seasoned foods, should be 
used moderately. 

Fresh air, exercise and sufficient protection from cold help to keep the nervous sys- 
tem in healthy condition. 

The habit of sleeping seven or eight hours each night is of prime importance. 

The habit of working earnestly at something that is thoroughly worth while, for at 
least 9 hours a day, helps to keep the nerves in good condition if this work is followed by 
periods of recreation of some sort. 

The habit of nerve control is absolutely essential and more easily acquired when the 
other points mentioned have been earnestly regarded. The nerves are delicate organs and 
become weakened if they are constantly kept alert. They must be allowed to relax and to 
rest thoroughly at some time during each day. 

The body is a wonderful mechanism, and like every complicated machine, it must have 
thoroughly intelligent and conscientious care if it is to perform satisfactory work and last 
its full time.

TAKE STOCK OF YOUR LOOKS 

Every woman can be good looking — if she will take as careful stock of her 
looks as she does of her pantry and not neglect the little things. 

Begin with the item of health. Is it "all there?" If not, what is missing? 
Find it and correct it. There are signs or symptoms which will reveal the deficient 
items in every case. Without the health right, one can no more build good to look 
upon than a picture can be wrought by the most skilled artist without the canvas 
upon which to put the pigment. 

Is your breath bad? It may be due to decayed teeth, catarrh, a sluggish con- 
dition in the stomach or the alimentary canal. Your breath may be bad and you 
not know it — you would not catch the odor yourself. Nothing is more offensive 
to those you come near than the whiff of a foul breath, but few friends have the 
courage to tell you of this. If you are occasionally subject to this, find the cause, 
learn to recognize it when it appears — and put a stop to its recurrence. 

The item of indigestion, or constipation, is neglected by far too many of us. 
It is the most fertile cause of many blemishes to good looks, as well as the most 
frequent miscreant of bad breath. It makes for headaches, pimples, muddy com- 
plexion, a general feeling of dullness, an ugly disposition and any number of 
other complaints. 

The remedy at times may be in laxatives; but permanent correction of the condition 
can be found only in exercise, careful eating, and the copious drinking of water, includ- 
ing hot water sipped slowly a half hour before breakfast. The exercise must 'take the 
form of abdominal movements and massage of the liver and bowels. There are literally 
hundreds of good "health exercise" systems published from time to time in magazines and 
countless are the books printed on the subject. The particular system selected is of less 
importance than that you take up one good, simple system of not too many or too difficult 
movements, then follow it regularly, and put your thought into seeing that the movements 
are gone through with in a way to really exercise the muscles until they are tired (but not 
exhausted) and that you do not in a few days get into the habit of listlesly performing the 
motions without any real muscular "pep." The glass of hot water is a most wonderful 
tonic. Put some lemon juice in it — no sugar — or a pinch of salt if not the lemon. Take it 
as hot as you can. Sip it slowly — don't just drink it dov^m. Do this on rising, before 
dressing. It passes immediately through the stomach, clears the latter of the alkalis or other 
juices left there, and puts it in fresh clear condition to start the day right when the break- 
fast reaches it, and it passes on into the bowels and puts them into fit condition for their 
work. 

After the hot water, take the exercises. After the exercises take your morning bath. 

You are then in literally clean and fit condition, inside and out, to break your fast, and 
start the fresh day with a fresh body. 

Take a glass of cold water just before retiring at night. 

Drink at meals, moderately if you want to, but rather between courses; do not use 
water to "wash down the food." No matter how dry the latter keep it in the mouth until 
the saliva takes care of it. 

Drink copiously between meals — two glasses of cold, not ice cold — water, an hour or 
two after each meal. A copious water diet, as above, and a breakfast principally fruit, will 
almost guarantee freedom from constipation and indigestion. Add the exercises for the ab- 

419 



420 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Section VIII— Personal Hygiene and Person 

dominal muscles and massage the liver and bowels, and the guarantee is absolute, unless 
of course the patient is chronically wrong, or persistently indulges other habits or appetites 
that counteract all of his good work through these agencies. 

Continuous daily eating of foods that do not agree with him, dissipation, alcoholic in- 
dulgence, and most especially irregularity in stools — which must be rigidly regular at the 
same hours every day — these things, usually will cancel the most patient and faithful atten- 
tion to "cures." 

Coated tongue and hot dry lips go with a bad breath and announce also a bad con- 
dition along the alimentary tract. 

Dry and yellow skin is usually due to the fact that one does not drink enough water. 

To you who are too stout; cut down on your diet — and cut again, and again — and 
don't "make up for it" by an occasional big meal, just as you are beginning to feel starved. 
Get out of doors and take lots of exercise. Avoid sweets, milk, cream, fat meats and es- 
pecially potatoes. Live mainly on lettuce, cabbage, spinach, just a very little of lean meats, 
young onions, celery, tomatoes, and very acid or tart fruits when you take any. Take 
salted toast instead of bread and butter. Cease to give yourself fat making food and you 
will cease creating fat cells. 

But you must really practice self-denial, and stay actually hungry most of the time 
for many weeks until your entire system has become accustomed to the new regime. It is 
astonishing how you will get used to it and get over that constant hunger, if you interest 
yourself in other things than food, and exercise enough. 

The Bath — On the w^hole, the warm bath, at about bodily temperature — not the hot 
bath, is best for the average individual. It should be followed by colder water — let the 
cold water run into the bath until there is a decided chill to it, then take a quick plunge that 
almost makes you gasp but is not a real shock to the system — then get out and rub your- 
self vigorously with a rough towel until the skin glows. 

The warm bath opens the pores and cleans you; the colder plunge closes the pores 
and prevents your taking colds easily; the rub starts the circulation and tones up the sys- 
tem, leaving the skin in a glowing, healthful condition. 

The very cold plunge or shower alone, strenuously advocated by many people, is not 
good for the average individual of sedentary habits of life. It is suitable under proper 
conditions for the athlete, or for those who lead a very active life; under certain specfiic 
conditions it fits specific cases but it is not ordinarily desirable for the ordinary man. 






BATH, COMPLEXION, FACE AND SKIN 



Bath Bags are made by filling a thick muslin or 
thin calico bag with two thirds of bran or oatmeal, 
and bits of soap and orris root, to give a sweet 
savor. Let this soak in the water before entering 
the bath, then make a splendid lather all over the 
skin. Use this only t'wo or three times a week. 
Use a bag only twice; once it sours it does more 
harm than good. 

Good Bran Bags can be purchased from almost 
any druggist. But if you prefer you can make 
them yourself. Mix equal parts of powdered oat- 
meal and bran together and to a pint add half a 
cup of powdered soap. To this add about an 
ounce of powdered orris root. Fill small bags and 
use in the bath. 

Bath Po^vder Mix 8 avoirdupois ounces each of 

powdered borax and white castile soap. Per- 
fume with a mixture of oil of lavender flowers, I 
fluid drachm; oil of rosemary, 1 fluid drachm; oil 
of bergamot, 2 fluid drachms; oil of lemon, 4 fluid 
drachms; oil of cloves, 8 drops. 

Bath Lotion — To wipe over the body with a wet 
cloth as a refreshing lotion; one-half pint of pure 
cologne, two ounces of spirits of camphor, two 
ounces of spirits of ammonia, five ounces of salt, 
and enough boiling water to make a quart. It can 
be rubbed into the skin with the hands, and is par- 
ticularly good to use as a rub after a long walk 
or much exercise. Shake bottle before using. 

Care of thei Skin — Does your skin look wilted, 
dry and drawn? Are you prematurely old look- 
ing? Do not blame it on hardship, but on your 
own indolence. Probably you seldom wash your 
face clean. Not one woman in ten really has a 
clean face. If you think your duty done by a dab 
with a wet cloth night and morning, with possibly 
an extra dab between if you have a social engage- 
ment, then is your face not clean. 

It is not necessary to spend money on getting 
a clean face. Cream lotions and massages are 
desirable; they are not indispensable. 

Use Complexion Brush — A good complexion 
brush with stifl bristles, costing from 75 cents up, 
will last for years if kept sanitary. 

With such a brush and pure soap and water 
one can get beneath the upper layer of oil into 
the underlying tsisues, and the dead, wilted look 
will disappear with the increased circulation in- 
duced. 

Do not wash with hard water. If your water has 
lime in it or if filtered with alum see that it is 
softened with a pinch of borax, soda, or a drop 
or two of benzoin. 

You may not be able to afford skin foods and 
massage creams but you can fill small bags of 



cheese cloth with oatmeal or barley and use them 
once a day on the face. 

Perhaps costly lotions for cleaning the skin are 
not for you; but skim milk is cheap and effective, 
so also is a wash basin filled with lukewarm water 
in which a potato or slices of lemon have been 
soaked. 

Some complexions will not "accept" soap and 
water, others cannot endure oil cosmetics. There 
is as much difference between complexions as there 

is between digestion what is food for one is poison 

for another. As a general rule for the average 
skin, the soap and water bath at night is of great 
benefit. To retire with the dust and grime of the 
day remaining on one*s countenance is to treat 
one's face to insult. 

Simple Beauty Rules — If the girl with the bilious 
yellow complexion and dark circles under the eyes, 
and the one whose chest is undeveloped from im- 
proper breathing and habitual stooping, and the 
one whose eyes are dull from perhaps a half dozen 
reasons, would follow some simple hygienic rules 
in their own homes instead of putting their n>oney 
into things "guaranteed to remove every blemish," 
or bust developers or patent lotions, eye bright- 
eners — there would be more pretty girls and fewer 
quack beauty parlors. 

Here are a few simple rules of beauty and hy- 
giene: 

First A daily bath, or at least a sponge followed 

by a good brisk rubbing. 

Second — Five minutes spent in deep breathing 
exercises. 

Third — Five minutes exercise or massage for 
the liver. 

Fourth Eight glasses of water a day two 

when you get up, two during the morning, two 
during the afternoon, and two before you go to 
sleep. 

Pifth — Seven or more hours of sleep in a room 
with open windows. 

Sixth — Persistent cheerfulness. 

Fruit Aids Beauty — Many fruits are appetizing, 
nourishing, refreshing and purifying, besides being 
food of a high order, therefore are of value to 
v\^omen in search of beauty. 

Apples, grapes, figs and dates are very nutritious 
and furnish a wholesome way of eating sugar. 
Black grapes and ripe peaches are fattening and 
easily digested when baked and eaten with cream; 
unless the digestion is good they should not be 
eaten raw in connection with farinaceous foods. 
Oranges, lemons, limes, grapes and apples are 
especially good for the complexion. 



421 



422 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Section VIII— Personal Hygiene and Person 



Nourishing Cold Cream — Cold creams are like 
soap; that which agrees with one skin may not with 
another. Only by experimenting can one secure 
the mixture that is nourishing. Some persons are 
strong advocates of witch hazel cream, and there 
is no doubt of its efficacy for those with whom it 
agrees. Besides being soothing, it has the virtue 
of bleaching the complexion. 

Fresh Cream — ^There is a most delightful cream 
which works veritable wonders if employed as soon 
as it is made and never after it has been mixed 
more than a week or so. 

Bleach for the purpose four ounces of sweet 
almonds and pound them until they are quite 
smooth, add the yolks of three eggs and mix with 
fresh milk or cream; boil as you would a custard 
until it thickens; then add the perfume you prefer. 
Seal virhile hot. 

Complexion Cream — One of the best prepara- 
tions for the complexion is an equal quantity of 
tincture of benzoin and glycerine. It is applied 
as any cold cream. 

For Dry Skin — ^When the skin becomes dry and 
peels from the face, the skin lacks the natural oil. 
To make the face smooth again, a good greasy 
skin food should be used to supply the oil that 
is lacking in the skin. Each night massage a 
good skin food into the face for about ten minutes, 
then leave a portion of the cream on the face over 
night. Don't use powder or soap on the face for a 
few days. Instead of soap cleanse the face with 
oatmeal, which is at any time an excellent cleanser. 

To Whiten — For whitening the throat make a 
thick soap jelly by shaving a bar of white soap 
into a pint of boiling water. Allow it to dissolve 
and cool. Lather the throat with this, then rinse 
in hot water, and massage the throat with a cut 
lemon. Lemon is one of the best bleachers. 

A lotion recommended to whiten a red nose is 
made of seven and a half grains of tannic acid and 
two and a half ounces of camphor water. After 
the acid is dissolved the nose is moistened several 
times, day and night, the liquid drying on. 

Lavender Water is easily manufactured at home 
at small cost. Take half a pint of rectified spirits, 
two drams of essential oil of lavender, and five 
drops of attar of rose. Shake well together till 
properly mixed. Keep it in a well-corked bottle. 

An Astringent Wash will harden the flabby 
tissues and counteract the oily condition of the 
skin. Take a half pint bottle and into it put one 
and one-half ounces of cucumber juice, half filling 
the bottle with elder flower water and adding one 
ounce of eau de cologne. Shake well. Add one- 



half ounce of simple tincture of benzoin, shake 
slightly and fill with elder flower water. Night 
and morning apply this with a soft sponge. 

Freckles — An excellent lotion for light freckles 
is made of the following: Milk 4 ounces, lemon 
juice I ounce, spirits of wine 2 drams. 

Blackheads — To treat the skin for blackheads 
bathe the face in warm virater, which is not too 
hot but pleasantly soothing to the skin. When the 
skin is pink and soft annoint it v^ith green soap. 
Rub it thoroughly into the pores for three minutes 
and rinse the face with warm water, using a 
camels hair complexion brush. Then use cold 
water until the face has become thoroughly cold. 
Wipe thoroughly with sterilized gauze or cheese 
cloth. Fill the skin with cold cream dabbed on all 
over, let it remain for half an hour and then wipe 
off with a soft cloth. Continue the treatment 
nightly until blackheads have disappeared. 

An excellent eradicator for blackheads is made 
of one ounce tincture of green soap and thirty 
drops peroxide of hydrogen. Mix and apply with 
absorbant cotton, rubbing thoroughly. Let it re- 
main on half an hour and then wash off with cold 
water. Repeat four times a day. 

Starch Face Powder — Here is a simple "starch" 
treatment which will improve the best of skins 
and is especially good for brown ones. Milk-wet 
starch has a decidedly whitening effect on a brown 
skin, and when dry, makes a perfect face powder. 

Bathe the face for five or six minutes in ice cold 1 
milk, then before the liquid has time to dry, seize I 
upon tiny cheese cloth bag half filled with pow- 
dered starch and holding it over your up-turned 
face, shake it gently, shifting its position every few 
seconds until the facial skin is lost to view be- 
neath a coat of white dust. The palm of the hand 
should now be passed over the face, with a gentle i 
kneading motion, as this "evens" the powder and l< 
masks the skin imperfections. 

Eyebrow^s To increase the growth of the eye- 
brows, rub pure olive oil in regularly each night. 

Wrinkles should be taken in hand early — before 
they become visible at all. Thirty is none too 
young to begin a treatment to ward off wrinkles; 
by forty the little lines may have established them- 
selves beyond repair. All facial blemishes show 
up much more plainly if the skin is not perfectly 
clean, healthy and fair; so a dingy, yellowish face 
should be assiduously guarded against. Soap 
should not be used on the complexion more than 
once a w^eek, when a thorough scrubbing and 
steaming are given. Cold cream should be well 
rubbed in every night before retiring and the face

bathed afterwards in hot and then cold water. This 
cold cream treatment will not remove wrinkles, but 
it will keep the face in such condition that they 
will not form so readily and can be more easily 
eradicated. 

Wrinkles, unless too deeply seated, in a woman 
past middle age, will usually yield to persistent 
massage treatment in conjunction with a good skin 
food. 

If the face is bathed every morning in a cupful 
of fresh milk, in which a teaspoonful of table salt 
has been tossed, the muscles will tighten and sag- 
ging lines will disappear. 

Scars on Face — Many people are bothered with 
scars, left usually by hard ugly pimples. The face 
should be carefully steamed every night until the 
skin is quite clear. 

Make a cone of paper and fit one end of it to 
the face and the other to the outside of a pitcher 
or a tin pail or kettle. Pour a quart of boiling 
water into the pail and place the face in the cone. 
Let the face remain over the steam until the steam 
ceases to be given off, which will probably be about 
ten or twelve minutes. 

After the steaming pat the face dry. rubbing it 
gently, and apply some cold cream. The face 
should be massaged after the effects of the steam- 
ing have passed away, and while massaging gently 
pinch the spots where the scars or marks of the 
pimples remain. 

Puffy Eyes — Bathe the eyes each morning, using 
an eye cup, and massage gently underneath them. 
This will help to remedy the puffiness. 

You may have some internal trouble that causes 
the puffy condition under the eyes and makes your 
complexion sallow. Water is a good complexion 
clearer. Take olive oil each day or lemon juice 
unsweetened. The external trouble cannot be 
remedied permanently while internal causes exist. 

Care of the Lips — The best way to treat cracks 
in lips, that sometimes make their appearance in 
cold weather, provided the cracks are not where 
they will break open whenever one laughs, is by 
astringents instead of greases. Many persons use 
cold cream or camphor ice at the first sign of such 
trouble, but they are not so quickly efficacious as 
spirits of camphor. It is drastic treatment to apply 
a stinging liquid to a raw spot but if one screws 
up courage enough to do it the result justifies the 
hurt. Creams and greases keep the sore places 
soft and while they undoubtedly allay the pain they 
do not aid in healing. Any lotion that keeps air 
from the raw spot relieves, but does not cure. An 



astringent, by drying the surface, helps form a scab, 
a natural protection, and healing goes on more 
rapidly. 

When afflicted with a deep crack like a cut 
in the middle of the lower lip. constant treatment 
with spirits of camphor is very beneficial. If out 
of doors all morning a tiny phial of the spirits 
should be carried so it can be used frequently. It 
feels like hot shot for a second but the sting soon 
passes away. The spirits should be put on night 
and morning also. Camphor ice will act in the 
same way. but (nuch more slowly. It is often nec- 
essary if the wound is located where it must be 
induced to "heal soft" — that is. if hardening it 
cannot be done because it breaks open whenever 
one laughs, or for other cause. 

Tincture of benoin may be applied in precisely 
the same way as the camphor spirits. If it is 
strong enough to cause an uncomfortable sensation 
of "drawing" it may be diluted with a few drops 
of glycerine, using but little of the latter for it 
neutralizes the astringent. 

Another pleasant and healing application is made 
by a solution of one grain of permanganate of 
potash in a tablespoonful of clean rose-water. 
While this is wet on the surface. French chalk 
should be dusted on. 

Cleanse Crack — It is always well to wash any 
sore spot with a weak solution of boracic acid 
before applying the astringent. The object of the 
acid is thoroughly to cleanse the sore. 

Red Blood — There is little doubt but that con- 
tinued cracking of the lip indicates a thin condition 
of the blood and a physical state below par. Tonics 
containing phosphates are usually prescribed and 
iron may be taken. This of course is a matter for 
physicians to decide and one should certainly be 
consulted when the lips cannot be healed. 

Little sore spots that sometimes stay so long 
in the corner of the mouth may come from the 
stomach; frequent applications of bicarbonate of 
soda will sometimes cure them. 

Superfluous Hairs — To treat, take enough pure 
peroxide of hydrogen to wet the hair and add a 
few drops of ammonia, which will bleach the hair 
and make it less conspicuous. 

Another Method, to bleach hair on arm: dampen 
baking soda with cold water and rub over the 
arms; leave it on several hours, then bathe the 
arm. Repeat daily until the hair is the shade you 
desire. 

Peroxide and ammonia vfiW bleach superfluous 
hair and will not destroy the growth.

CARE OF THE SKIN 

(Iowa State College Bulletin) 

Care of the Skin — "The care of the skin takes on special significance when 
it is known that from one to two and a half pints of waste matter pass through the 
skin every twenty-four hours. An exposure to cold or lack of sufficient protection 
prevents this process, throws the strain upon the kidneys and is liable to derange 
the excretory organs." 

The skin is a very important organ of excretion and must be kept in perfect 
working order. 

Baths — The cleansing bath ranges in temperature from 90 to 95° F. This is so near 
the normal temperature of the body that no shock is felt, especially if the bath is taken in 
a warm room. The soap should not contain an excess of alkali. The strong soaps take 
oil from the skin and leave it dry and rough. All soap should be rinsed from the skin by 
the free use of clear water. The toweling should be brisk and thorough. The thorough 
rubbing after the bath increases circulation, and by so doing helps to keep the skin well 
fed and firm. The cleansing bath is the best taken at night, since it is not only cleansing 
but relaxing. The fact that much impurity is deposited upon the skin through the perspi- 
ration glands makes the daily cleansing bath necessary for comfort, self-respect and good 
health. If the deposit is not removed the excretion is retarded, because the pores of the 
skin are closed by the deposit upon the surface of the skin. 

The tonic bath is best taken in the morning. It should be cold enough to cause the 
contraction of the blood vessels at the surface of the body. This contraction sends an addi- 
tional amount of blood to the heart. The additional blood stimulates increased heart action 
and sends the blood bounding back to the surface of the body again. This reaction leaves 
the skin warm and the circulation active. A cold bath should never be taken in a cold 
room. It should not be taken w^hen one is greatly fatigued and it should not continue more 
than a minute. The cold bath should be followed by a brisk rubbing. While the cold 
bath is most beneficial for the normal person, it should not be persisted in unless it leaves 
the person warm and vigorous. 

The curative baths are Turkish, alcoholic, electric, salt, milk and hot water. The Tur- 
kish bath opens the pores of the skin and gives the skin a thorough cleansing. It then 
closes the pores by a cold bath, and relaxes the muscles by a thorough rubbing. 

A plain hot water bath opens the pores of the skin and draws the blood away from the 
inner parts of the body. It is too stimulating to the nervous system to be taken frequently. 
Its chief purpose is to relieve inflammation in the deeper parts of the body. 

Prevention of Colds — Careful care of the skin as has been indicated, helps to remove 
wastes and helps to maintain the normal condition, and for these reasons becomes a vital 
factor in the prevention of colds. The fact that a person is easily susceptible to colds in- 
dicates that the body is not in good working order. Prevent colds by proper diet, good ven- 
tilation, moderate amount of heat in living room, an ample amount of outdoor exercise 
and a sufficient amount of sleep and rest. 

The Hands — It is not necessary for the hands to be rough and red, even though they 
perform much work. A good, mild soap (like plain castile) and some simple lotion (like 
glycerine and carbolic acid) will keep the hands soft and sufficiently moist, if used faith- 
fully. 



PERSONAL HYGIENE AND PERSON— CARE OF THE SKI N 425 

The Face — Do not let the face carry all the worries that have been experienced in a 
lifetime and do not allow it to become rough and dry. Keep the muscles relaxed by mas- 
sage. To keep the skin moist and pliable, use a mild soap, and very little of it. Follow 
the washing by a rinsing in cold water. 

Skin Blemishes — Do not depend upon outward applications to remove blemishes of the 
skin. They are the result of some failure to care for the body properly. Prevent them by 
proper diet, exercise, ample amount of fresh air, ample amount of sleep, proper clothing. 
The care of the body determines its condition. Care for the body and there will be no blem- 
ishes of the skin. Be careful to use your own soap and your ov^m towel. Diseases of the 
skin are often contracted by using the public towel and the public soap.

THE HAIR AND SCALP 

A few general rules for the care of the hair: 

Avoid strong soap and alkalis, such as soda and ammonia, hair tonics of 
which you are not sure, and too much hot water. TTiese all dry up natural oil and 
make the hair harsh and given to falling. 

Depend on regular brushing of hair rather than on tonics. Ten minutes of 
stiff brushing twice a day will do wonders for preventing the hair thinning. 

The hair is improved by heating the brush before using. Frequently hold the brush 
to the fire, then brush the scalp. Hair, highly charged with electricity, is snappy and will 
fly about in the most unruly manner, but it can be evenly brushed with the heated brush. 

Keep the hair absolutely clean. This may be assisted by a dry shampoo if a wet one 
cannot be given frequently. For a dry shampoo, powder the hair and scalp well and brush 
until every particle of powder is gone. 

Hair should always be thoroughly dried, as the mingling of water with natural oil 
causes fermentation, w^hich means dandruff and falling locks. Give the hair plenty of light 
and air, but do not expose it to the hot rays of the sun for long at a time. It bleaches the 
hair and often blisters the scalp, drying up the natural oil. 

So long as the scalp moves freely over the skull there is hope for the bald head. 

Be particular not to use the brushes and combs of another, and do not use your own 
in an unsanitary condition. One cause of the baldness of men is their carelessness in this 
respect. 

Do not burn your hair, twist it into tortuous knots, strain it back from the temples or 
wear it always in the same coil. 

After washing the head thoroughly withsoft water and soap put a teaspoonful or more 
of lemon juice in the last rinsing water. This will make the hair soft and fluffy. 

CARE OF THE HAIR 

(Iowa State College Bulletin) 

The Hair — ^The hair is provided w^ith oil by the sebaceous glands that lie at its 
roots. Regular and vigorous brushing of the hair increases the flow of oil and keeps 
the hair glossy. The hair is fed by the blood vessels that enter the inner layer of 
the skin, in which the hair root is imbedded. A good nervous system, which pro- 
motes good circulation, is one of the essentials in producing a healthy growth of 
hair. 

It is as necessary for the scalp to be kept clean as for the surface of any other portion 
of the skin to be kept clean. The hair should be thoroughly brushed to remove dust. It 
should be left loose and free at night to allow the moisture to evaporate and to permit air to 
pass through it freely. The scalp should be thoroughly rubbed at least once a week. This 
promotes a good circulation and thus gives the hair a vigorous growth.

HAIR AND SCALP MISCELLANIES 

Washing the Hair — The hair should be washed at least once a month. Soft water, 
mild soap and thorough rinsing in clear water are essential to a successful washing. 

Dry Cleaning — Part the hair and rub coarse com meal on the scalp. Use at least 
two cups of corn meal. After the meal has been thoroughly rubbed over the entire sur- 
face of the scalp, brush thoroughly until all traces of the meal have been removed. Drv 
cleaning removes dust and stimulates the hair, because of the thorough rubbing. It also re- 
moves the superfluous oil. Too frequent washing rennoves too much oil and leaves the hair 
too dry and brittle. For this reason it is well to use the dry cleaning occasionally. 



Hair Too Oily — It is an interesting fact that the 
majority of scalp troubles begin with an appear- 
ance of oiliness. This condition often develops 
when a girl is "run down." Build up by sleep, 
fresh air and nutritious diet. 

An excellent preparation for application to an 
oily scalp is composed of the following: Precip- 
itated sulphur, I drachm; salicylic acid, 15 grains; 
glycerine of starch, I drachm; alcohol, 6 drachms; 
water up to 4 ounces. This may be scented if 
desired. 

To Brighten the Hair — To brigthen dead looking 
hair use diluted peroxide of hydrogen, which is 
applied in the following manner; first wash the 
hair thoroughly, using ammonia to cut all grease. 
Dry the hair, preferably in the sun. Half fill a 
saucer with hydrogen peroxide, add one-half as 
much w^ater, dip into it a clean hair brush and 
apply the mixture thoroughly to the hair. This 
will not be sufficient to make any noticeable change 
in the color. 

Brush the hair with the damp brush and stand 
in the sunshine, if possible, until the hair is thor- 
oughly dry. Do not repeat the process for two 
months at the earliest unless you want to make 
the hair much lighter. This in no way injures 
ashly looking hair, but it really improves its ap- 
pearance. However, it must never be lavishly 
used. 

To Make Glossy — A very good preparation to 
make the hair glossy is composed of two drachms 
of castor oil and six ounces of cologne water. A 
few drops of this dressing or brillantine are poured 
into the palm of the hand. A soft, spotlessly 
clean hair brush is gently rotated on the palm so 
that the dressing may be evenly distributed on the 
bristles. Now apply it to the hair, which should 
have received a previous brushing with stiffer 
bristles. The brillantine is gently spread over the 
hair and a soft silk handkerchief is used to give 
the final polish. 

Medicine Dropper for Hair — ^When using hair 
tonic or hair-dressing the most economical and sat- 
isfactory way is to use a bent glass medicine 
dropper. This permits the exact quantity wanted 



to be deposited where needed at the roots of the 
hair. 

A Home-Made Hair Tonic that is really wonder- 
ful in its results, is absolutely harmless, and actually 
retards falling hair and tones the scalp in every 
way, is made as follows: 

Take 2 teaspoonfuls of sulphur and mix with 
about five cents worth of glycerine. Pour over a 
package of sage about a quart of boiling water; 
let steep on back of stove about two hours; when 
cool strain into bottle and add sulphur and glycer- 
ine. Then add small quantity of alcohol, just 
enough to keep the tonic from souring — about 
2 tablespoonfuls. The sulphur may not all be dis- 
solved; that does not matter simply shake well 

each time before using. It is the sulphur in the 
tonic that stops and cuts dandruff, and dandruff 
causes the hair to fall out. Rub the scalp with the 
finger ends until it feels hot, then rub the tonic 
into the scalp. 

Restores Graying Hairs — Moisten a sponge or 
soft brush with the above tonic and draw this 
through the hair, taking one strand at a time. The 
graying hairs in the head will begin to disappear 
after two or three applications, the natural color 
is restored and it becomes thick, glossy and 
lustrous. 

Ten minutes spent every evening will give you 
almost a new head of hair in tvfo months, put new 
life into the hair roots, restore the gray hairs and 
stop additional hairs graying. The hair will grow 
several inches under the treatment. The scalp 
must be regularly massaged with the fingers each 
time before and after the application is made. 

Gray Hair — Stop the Causes — They are many: 
poor health, shock, extracting too much of the 
natural oil of the scalp by too frequent shampoo- 
ing, etc. If the hair is dry, rub yellow vaseline on 
the scaip every other day, then brush it thoroughly. 

It is difficult to entirely restore color to hair that 
has turned gray. The application of oil will some- 
times do it, and very occasionally an extremely 
stimulating tonic is beneficial. Try one made of 
one ounce of castor oil, an ounce of strong am- 
monia in liquid, two ounces of French brandy, and 



PERSONAL HYGIENE AND PERSON— HAIR AND SCALP 



429 



»ix ounces of rose water. This may be massaged 
into the scalp every other day, not oftener. 

For Dandruff Only — Warm borax water will re- 
move dandruff; it has no general tonic effect, how- 
ever, for hair and scalp otherwise. 

Though dandruff is not originally a disease, it 
may easily become the predisposing cause for 
many disorders of the scalp, just as neglect to 
keep the body clean brings on its train of con- 
sequential evils. 

The permanent benefit — It is necessary when 
troubled with dandruff to massage the scalp thor- 
oughly, after which you will find the following 
treatment very beneficial: moisten the scales of 
dandruff with olive oil; when crusts are soft, 'wash 
scalp with tincture of green soap. Rinse thor- 
oughly and apply almond oil to the scalp. Rub in 
with your finger tips, then use the following 
shampoo: Ammonia muriate, ten grains; glycerine, 
one ounce; rose water, five ounces. Rub this 
briskly into the scalp. At the end of ten days use 
the following shampoo: 

Soap Jelly Shampoo — Shave a small cake of best 
white Castile soap into a pint of boiling w^ater and 
let stand until thick, then add a teaspoonful of 
glycerine and a few drops of your favorite per- 
fume. The glycerine is softening and healing to 
the scalp. 

The hair must be wet enough so that the *'jelly" 
will adhere; then by rubbing until a thick lather 
forms the whole head and scalp will be thoroughly 
cleansed before using the abundance of warm 
water always necessary for rinsing. After a care- 
ful rinsing continue with waters gradually cooled 
until quite cold. 

For Dry Hair — If the hair is dry and brittle 
and you have abused it in any manner, such as 
getting it wet with salt water and then drying in 
the sun, you must take immediate steps to keep it 
from falling out. The hair should be shampooed 
with an egg mixture. No ammonia, borax, or any 
sort of alkali must be used on hair that has been 
thus abused. 

Split-end Hair — If your hair shows split-ends and 
a tendency to fall out, have the split ends clipped 
off, and if the hair is long enough to permit it, have 
at least two inches of it cut off. Then every night 
brush the hair thoroughly with a stiff (not a wire) 



brush and after the brushing have a tonic massaged 
into the scalp. 

Egg Shampoo — Yolk of one egg, one pint of 
rainwater (lukewarm), an ounce of rosemary 
spirits. Beat the mixture up thoroughly and use 
it warm, rubbing well into the skin of the head. 
Rinse in several waters. The scalp should be mas- 
saged every night, moistening the finger tips with 
olive oil, and the following lotion may be applied: 

Lotion — Glycerine, 1 ounce; eau de cologne, 
J/2 pint, liquid ammonia, 1 drachm; oil of geranium, 
oil of rosemary, j/2 drachm of each; tincture of 
cantharides, I ounce. Briskly agitate for ten min- 
utes and then add camphor julep Yi pint and 
again mix well and stir. A few drops of essence 
of musk or other perfume can be added. 

Shampoo for Golden Hair — Golden hair requires 
the most careful brushing and cleaning. An in- 
fusion of camomile flowers is a good shampoo for 
light hair. An effective dry shampoo for such hair 
is m£.de of alcoholic ammonia, half an ounce; the 
same tincture of quinine, two drachms of essence of 
wood violet, and alcohol suflicient to make eight 
ounces. The shampoo should be applied by rub- 
bing it well into the scalp and drying the head with 
a rough towel No water is required. 

Massage your Scalp but do not rub the hair. 
Separate the hair and rub vaseline on the scalp 
Gently, then place the tips of the fingers firmly on 
the scalp and work all over the scalp with a rotary 
motion and move the scalp with each rotation of 
the fingers; loosening the scalp with each rotation 
does much good. 

Eyebrows and Lashes — Use as a tonic for the 
eyebrows one ounce of yellow vaseline and eight 
drops each of oil of lavender and rosemary. Place 
a drop of the tonic on an eyebrow brush and 
smooth eyebrow carefully after the face has been 
washed. 

Do not use this preparation on the lashes. Ap- 
ply only yellow vaseline to them, using a small 
camels hair brush and rubbing gently along the 
roots. 

Do not Cut Eyelashes — Try nnelting yellow vas- 
eline and putting it on the roots of the lashes v^ith 
a tiny camels hair brush, being careful not to 
get any of the oil in the eyes. This is excellent 
to promote growth of scanty lashes.

CARE OF THE TEETH 

A famous old Frenchman was once heard to say that a woman with really 
good teeth could never be plain. Although this may be rather a sweeping state- 
ment there is no doubt that an otherwise plain appearance is often redeemed by 
a perfect set of teeth and the effect of many a pretty face marred by bad teeth. 

CARE OF TEETH 

(Iowa State College Bulletin) 
The tooth consists of root and crown. There is a small opening at the end 
of each root through which the nerves and blood vessels pass. This opening leads 
to the pulp cavity which extends through the entire inner part of the crown and 
root. The greater part of the crown consists of dentine, which is covered by a layer 
of hard enamel as a protective layer. The dentine of the root is covered with a 
layer of cement. 

Effect of Acid on Teeth 

The chief element in the composition of the teeth is lime, and lime is easily decom- 
posed by acid. 

Experiment — Drop a few drops of hydrochloric acid upon a piece of lime and notice 
what happens. The gas bubbles that are seen show that the lime is being decomposed by 
the acid. 

This experiment shows the effect of acids upon the lime in the teeth. 

Source of Acid — The bacteria cause the fermentation of the lodged particles of food. 
The acid formed eats into the lime in the tooth and may continue to eat until the nerve 
is exposed, if the tooth is not cared for. 

Effects of Tartar — Tartar is composed of lime which is deposited from the saliva. Tar- 
tar forms on the inner side of the lower front teeth and at the base of the crown of the 
teeth. It forms a hard crust which prevents the removal of acid and bacteria by means 
of the brush. The tartar should be thoroughly removed by a dentist at least once a year. 

Removal of Acid — Brushing with a solution of baking soda neutralizes the acid. Brush- 
ing with clear water, after this, removes all acid from the mouth. 

Removal of Food Particles — A thorough brushing after each meal, before breakfast 
and after supper is the ideal method of caring for the teeth. A thorough brushing means 
a brushing of at least five minutes. The brush should come in contact with all parts of the 
teeth, upper and lower, front and back, inner and outer surface. A good powder should 
be used several times a week, but all traces of powder should be removed by brushing with 
clear water. If the brushing is followed by a thorough mouth rinse of listerine solution it is 
much better. 

Care of Child's Teeth — Each child should have his tooth brush and be taught to use 
it as soon as he is two or three years old. It is very desirable that he acquire the habit 
of caring for his teeth. In this way tooth brushing becomes as much a part of the day's 
routine as eating and sleeping. 

Dentist's Care — The dentist, like the doctor, should be given a chance to prevent trou- 
ble rather than to correct it. Let the dentist do his work at the first warning. Remember 
that mastication is an important step in digestion. Save the teeth. 

431 



432 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK — Section VIII — Personal Hygiene and Person 

A Few Don'ts — Do not bite thread with the teeth. It may break the enamel after a 
time. Do not crack nuts with the teeth. Nature did not plan them to be used as cast iron 
hammers. They are not strong enough for that. Avoid drinking extremely hot drinks 
or extremely cold drinks. Either practice may weaken the enamel of the teeth. Do not 
forget that a gum-boil may mean an abcessed tooth and that the dentist should be con- 
sulted. 

Tooth Building Food — Since the chief element in the composition of the teeth is lime, 
such foods must be included in the diet, as contain lime. Some of these foods are spinach, 
lettuce, celery, tomatoes, cabbage, parsnips, mushrooms, turnips, com, beets, asparagus, 
cauliflower, carrots, string beans, potatoes, radishes and onions. These are the chief lime- 
producing foods and help to build up the teeth. 

The teeth are so absolutely necessary to good digestion that too much care cannot 
be taken to preserve them. If the child's teeth decay prematurely it is not an accident and 
may not be altogether the result of a failure to keep them clean. It is very frequently the 
result of a poorly nourishd body and it is quite as necessary to study the feeding and gen- 
eral care of the body as to study the care of the teeth. 

MISCELLANIES ON TEETH 

Night Cleansing — Perfectly formed, even white teeth are a natural gift, but much can 
be done to improve the color and keep them in good condition, chief among these little 
attentions being careful brushing night and morning. Now, while everyone cleans his or 
her teeth in the morning, very many, unfortunately for their teeth, neglect to do so at 
night, and this is a very grave mistake. During the night particles of food which have 
lodged between the teeth do incalculable damage. If but two or three minutes is given to 
brushing them at night much decay is arrested. 

Tartar — The presence of tartar upon the teeth is a source of worry to many, as it is 
not only unsightly but causes the teeth to ache and makes tender gums. Tartar can be 
removed quite easily. Procure a small quantity of magnesia, wet the tooth brush in warm 
water, dip into the magnesia, and rub the teeth upon which the tartar has collected. If one 
application does not entirely remove it, give a second treatment the next day. 

The Best Mouth Wash — Used by the Medical Corps in the Army: Five drops of lysol 
in a glass of warm water. Lysol is a soapy carbolic preparation. The lysol wash is a most 
efficient disinfectant for germs located in the mouth as well as a deodorizer; the alkali in 
the soap neutralizes the mouth acids. 

The brush for cleaning the teeth should be fairly stiff, but not hard enough to injure the 
gums. 

Children's Teeth — At the first sign of decay a dentist should be consulted and a cav- 
ity filled. Neglect to do this results in the loss of the teeth eventually, and although the 
modern art of dentistry is now so perfect that false teeth or crowns can be procured to look 
exactly like one's own they can never be quite the same, and children especially are enti- 
tled to early care and sound, natural teeth. 

Once mature years have been reached nothing can be done for the shape of the teeth 
or toward regulating their position, but those who have care of children should see that 
these matters are promptly attended to by the dentist, for much of the pain and discom- 
fort which so many people experience with their teeth through life can be prevented by a 
little attention in childhood. 

Four Essentials — For the care and preservation of the teeth: Proper diet, proper tooth 
brush, proper tooth powders or pastes and proper mouth bath. 



PERSONAL HYGIENE AND PERSON— CARE OF THE TEETH 433 

Dental Floss — The passing of dental floss back and forth between the teeth at least 
once a day is desirable. Care should be observed, however, not to injure the gums by mak- 
ing them bleed. 

Use Magnesia — A mouthful of magnesia taken into the mouth every night, allowing it 
to penetrate every nook and cranny, will correct tendency to acidity and prevent the decay 
which comes from chemical decomposition of particles of food. A good milk of mag^nesia 
is even better for this purpose. 

Sore Gums — If the gums are sore and festered, if caries have formed around or be- 
tween the teeth, do not fail to consult a reliable dentist without delay. Such a condition 
of the mouth and gums may poison the blood and seriously impair the general health. 

Digestion — A healthy digestion is important in keeping the mouth sweet and clean; 
saliva free from elements that tend to cause decay of the teeth is essential to a wholesome 
condition of the alimentary canal.

CARE OF THE EYES, EARS AND NOSE 

(Iowa State College Bulletin) 

The Eyes — Keep the body in good health. The general health has a direct in- 
fluence upon the vigor and the activity of the eye. 

Do not hold the eye to close work for too great a length of time. This is too taxing 
for the muscles of accommodation. If it is necessary to do the close work, rest the eye fre- 
quently by looking at some distant objects. This gives an opportunity for the muscles of 
accommodation to relax. 

Do not hold the printed page too far from or too close to the eye. Eighteen inches 
is about the proper distance. Fine print is too taxing to the eye. A glossy paper is more 
taxing upon the eye than paper with a dull finish. 

Soft, restful colors are less taxing to the eyes than the bright, glaring colors. Soft 
tan, dull green and soft gray are restful colors and are good colors to choose for wall 
coverings, especially for school room walls. A highly finished white wall is irritating to the 
eye. Red is an irritating color and should not be used for wall colorings. 

Reading while a train is in motion is taxing to the eyes, because the muscles of ac- 
commodation are required to work too hard, n adjusting the lenses of the eye to suit the 
motion of the printed page before the eye. 

A poor light is not true economy. The poor light is a direct means of injuring the 
sight, and expert care of the sight is more expensive than adequate lighting facilities. It 
is possible to have good lights in the farm home, now that gasoline lamps, denatured al- 
cohol lamps and the home gas plant have been perfected to such a degree. TTie light from 
sun or artificial source should not shine directly into the eyes. School room seats should 
be so arranged as to prevent this. The bed of the invalid should be arranged with this 
thought in view. Infants w^ho are out for an airing should have eyes protected from the 
sunlight. 

Veils with large spots are injurious to the eyes and should not be worn. Bright red 
veils should not be worn. 

Expert care of the eye is needed when it becomes necessary to hold the printed page 
other than at normal distance from the eye, when severe headaches seem to indicate that the 
eyes are not normal and when the school child is unable to read blackboard work readily. 

Imperfect organs of sight not only prevent the full enjoyment of surroundings, but im- 
pair the general health. 

Care of Elars — A study of the structure of the ear will suggest the danger of using sharp 
instruments of any kind in removing substances from the ear. The tympanum or sounding 
board of the ear is a delicate and tightly stretched membrane which is easily punctured. 
A study of the location of the eustachian tube will show the close relation between the ear 
and throat, and demonstrate the fact that the hearing may be impaired by a diseased throat. 
Avoid colds by taking care of the body. Keep the throat in good condition and you will 
also help to keep the ears in normal condition. 

Avoid taking young children where the ears will be shocked by loud and discordant 
noises. Loud noises are stimulating and irritating. 

Care of the Nose — The nostrils have been provided with a sieve of fine hairs called 
cilia. The function of the cilia is to exclude dust in order that the throat and lungs may 
be protected from irritation. The cilia do their work as best they can, considering our care- 
lessness. We sweep carelessly and raise a large amount of dust. We fail to ventilate prop- 

435 



436 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Section VIII— Personal Hygiene and Person 

erly and so irritate the lining of the nostrils. We fail to care for the body properly and so 
continue to take cold easily. Repeated colds leave the cavities of the nose filled with 
wastes and leave the membrane weakened. 

Suggestions — Use dustless sweeping powder. Use a vacuum cleaner. Use a paraffin 
mop, use a cotton Hannel broom bag and dip the bag in melted paraffin. In these and other 
ways remove the dust from the house. Keep the body in good condition and aid in pre- 
vention of colds. Breathe through the nostrils and thus prevent the entrance of dust.

CARE OF THE HANDS AND NAILS 

The most amazing amount of damage is done to the hands and nails where 
women grow negligent in their care and because they do long continued work fall 
into the lazy habit, after a time, of letting the hands go "till they get through." 
Girls in offices, or at a sales counter, frequently injure their hands astonishingly 
by not washing them often enough. And the woman in the home contracts the 
same habit far more often than she thinks she is ever going to allow herself. 

When cleaning hands that are really stained with dirt which has remained in 
the pores for several hours, soap and water should not be the first application, for 
nothing but a soft grease will be effective. Vaseline is one of the best dust remov- 
ers, for it penetrates all cracks, softening instead of hardening the matter. A fluid 
soap used directly afterwards extracts the grease, bringing the foreign matter with 
it. In cases of extreme soil mere washing leaves the skin in a dingy condition. 
This is the explanation of many unsightly hands and a defect that is easily reme- 
died. There are other oily applications as beneficial as vaseline for this purpose, 
among them being sweet almond oil, or soft cold cream. A necessary feature of 
these is that the application must be either liquid or one that liquifies quickly, or 
it will only be a dust collector. 

Wash Hands in Grease — It takes less than five minutes to get into condition if a pot 
of grease is kept near the washstand and is used in hberal quantities, as for instance a lump 
the size of an English walnut at each cleansing. This takes about half a minute. Then the 
hands must be dipped into warm (not hot) water. Any simple soap may be used, but strong 
kinds should be avoided. A nail brush is necessary, but one of an inexpensive quality will 
be as cleansing as a costly one. The finger tips require several extra strokes. Rinsing must 
be thorough. 

How to Dry the Hands — Drying is not the simple process that many persons think and 
in the manner of doing it lies half the secret of having pretty nails. 

Each finger must be taken separately, the towel rubbed down the sides, back and 
front, beginning at the tip. The common mistake is to begin at the finger base and rub up, 
which simply trains the cuticle down over the nails and thickens the tips. 

Every nail must be wiped individually commencing at the top and pressing gently 
down to the crescent of the base of the nail. Only in this way will good shape be pre- 
served. The fact that knuckles are not thoroughly dried is many times an explanation of 
redness. 

For Rough Hands — Use a mixture of glycerine For whitening the hands an excellent formula 

and bay rum, equal parts; rub over the hands each to be used after washing is made of 15 grains of 

time after having them in water any length of powdered borax, 1 5 grains of common table salt, 

time; dry them over the fire, not with towel. Use one-half dram of spirits of ammonia, one dram oil 

the preparation before retiring at night. Perfume of orange, two ounces of glycerine and six ounces 

the mixture if you like. You will never have of almond, 

rough hands with this treatment. Chapping— Rub a few drops of glycerine into

powdered oatmeal and almond meal in quantities If the hands perspire apply this lotion; cologne

If the perspiration on the hands is excessive 
bathe thoroughly with this astringent lotion several 
times daily: Rose water, six ounces; elder flower 
water, two ounces; simple tincture of benzoin, one- 
half ounce; tannic acid, 10 grains. 

If the hands and arms turn unusually red try 
this liquid-white, which will hide, but will not re- 
duce redness: Pure oxide of zinc, one ounce; 
glycerine, one dram; rose water, four ounces; es- 
sence of rose, 1 5 drops. Shake well and apply 
with a soft sponge or an antiseptic gauze. The 
skin must be well wiped off before the liquid dries. 

Home Manicuring — In these days, when beauty 
culture is a fine art, every woman who has con- 
sideration for her appearance sees that her nails 
are well kept and daintily manicured. 

This does not involve the expenditure of either 
a great deal of time or trouble; neither is it nec- 
essary to engage the services of a professional man- 
icurist. A few simple instruments, and five minutes 
devoted to their care two or three times a week 
will serve to keep the nails in perfect order. 

All that is required is a pair of sharp scissors, 
a file, a few emery boards, an orange stick, a 
cuticle knife and a chamois leather-covered nail 
polisher. 

The Process — Before attempting to manicure 
the nails, soak the hands in a basin of warm soapy 
water, so that the cuticle may become perfectly 
soft and easy to manipulate. 

Filing — When this has been done, file the nails 
carefully. They should be cut so that the extreme 
edges of the nail and the tip of the finger are 
even, and each nail should be cut to follow the 
curve of the finger to which it belongs. Pointed 
nails are not only unfashionable but positively 
ugly. After filing, rub each nail with an emery 
to ensure its being perfectly smooth at the tip. 

The Half-Moon — Now loosen the cuticle or skin 
round the base of the nail' with the cuticle knife. 
This should be done carefully. If the skin gets 
cut in the process a raw bleeding appearance will 
be the result. The skin should first be lifted away 
from the nail, and then when perfectly loose 
pressed back to reveal the little half-moon at the 
base. 



In some hands these half-moons are visible on 
all the fingers, even when the hands have been 
neglected, on others they are only visible after 
long treatment, but in the majority of hands they 
will be quite plainly seen after two or three man- 
icures. They are, however, such a decided adjunct 
to the beauty of the hand that it is quite worth 
while to take a little trouble to cultivate them. 

Hang Nails — Often after loosening the cuticle 
small portions of the skin will adhere to the nails. 
These can be removed at once by dipping an 
orange stick into soapy water or a little vaseline 
and rubbing the nail with it. Any "hang nails" : 

must be clipped off as closely as possible, but it I 

is a good plan to avoid cutting the cuticle whenever I 

possible, as doing so only helps to render it hard, I 

thick and coarse. 1 

Finishing — ^A piece of cut lemon rubbed over 
the nails will remove any stains, and a little white 
vaseline should then be smeared on, wiped off with 
a soft rag, a little pink polishing powder dusted 
on, and the chamois-leather nail polisher applied. 
When all is finished, dip the finger tips again into 
the soapy water to cleanse them from the vaseline 
and powder, and dry the hands on a soft towel. 
It is a good plan to press the cuticle around each , . 

nail carefully back each time the hands are washed 1 1 

and dried, as this will serve to keep the little half- ' ; 

moon visible. 

Blunt Instruments — When purchasing a cuticle 
knife care should be taken to see that it is not too 
sharp. Except the scissors, all the instruments 
used for manicuring should be rather blunt, as 
when sharp they are apt to injure the surface of 
the nail, leaving it rough, and also to cut and 
bruise the cuticle. 

Bleach the Nails — Finger nails that retain their 
grayish tinge at the tips should be bleached. This 
can be done with borax dampened vrith ammonia, i 

or ammonia and peroxide of hydrogen. Moisten 1 
the nails on the underside, slip some cotton or a 
cambric handkerchief over the orange stick, and 
mpe the nail edges. In most cases the nails are 
instantly turned a shell white. 

For Brittle Nails — If nails break easily rub with 
cold cream or white vaseline or cocoa butter and 
their brittleness will be lessened.

CARE OF THE FEET 

Pink toes, arched feet, thin and slender ones, are as much an attraction 
as a straight nose, well curved lips and telling eyes. It is not perhaps given many 
of your friends to see your feet frequently unshod, but your own sense of comfort 
and well-being as well as your self-consciousness of cleanliness and neatness are 
involved in the question of your feet. 

We often ignore the item of sensible care of the feet — not merely the trimming of toe 
nails and the treatment of soft and hard corns or callous places but the reasonable way 
of treating this important part of our physical makeup so as to avoid unnecessary suffering. 
For instance, there is the shoe question, which is in summer time so annoying and weighty. 
A foot specialist declares that canvas shoes, or soft thin tan ones, are or ought to be 
the only eligible kind for summer wear. To bring back our feet, our poor misused, ill- 
treated feet, to their normal and natural state, means much to health and temper. 

Should we happen to be enjoying ourselves for a brief space in the country the chance 
to wear sandals, or in some other way "almost nothing," should not be missed; it is bene- 
fiting and refreshing to the utmost. Are we less fortunate, let us adapt ourselves and go 
stocking footed around the house for a while each day. 

When you bathe your feet, add a little alum, to water hot and cold alternately; it will 
help a great deal in keeping them in good condition and you will find your general com- 
fort greatly increased. Some prefer sharp salt water, some bismuth, but an addition of the 
one or the other is very much to be recommended. 

A little cold cream or olive oil rubbed in and then carefully wiped off, then powder- 
ing, is delicious for tired feet. 

It is not a bit hard to avoid sore feet, even for the most trying occupations; it is all 
in the knowing how — and w^hat is most important is following the dictates of one's own 
good common sense and experience. 

FEET AND THEIR CLOTHING 

(Iowa State College Bulletin) 

Physical efficiency depends upon the normal condition of all of the organs 
of the body and two of the members that have much to do with the physical effi- 
ciency are the feet. Many feet are ruined by being carelessly shod in the early life 
of the child. The mother who is careless in this respect has much to be responsi- 
ble for. 

Precautions — Be sure that the heel of the shoe is low enough to throw the weight of 
the body upon the ball of the foot. This height varies with different people. Be sure that 
the shoe fits snugly around the heel and instep. The shoe that is loose at the heel slips and 
fails to protect the heel or instep. The instep especially needs protection because of the 
weight it has to carry and because of the number of small bones which are bound together 
by ligaments. 

Be sure that the widest part of the foot (across the foot at the great toe joint) ex- 
actly coincides with the widest part of the shoe. Be sure that the shoe is amply wide at 
the toes. There should be room for the toes to move freely. The freedom of motion in- 
sures good circulation and good circulation insures proper nourishment of the feet. The toe 
of the shoe should be so shaped as to allow the great toe to lie in a vertical position rather 
than to be crowded into an oblique position. 

441 



442 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK — Section VIII — Personal Hygiene and Person 

The shoe should be made of firm, but porous leather. A dense leather does not al- 
low the moisture to evaporate and so makes the feet tender. The fact that the leather is 
stiff retards the free action of the joints and muscles and so weakens the feet. 

The sole of the street shoe should be thick enough to protect the sole of the foot from 
dampness. The low shoe should not be worn except in warm weather. Severe colds, 
weak throats and weak lungs are directly traceable to low shoes and to thin soles. 

Care of Feet — ^The feet are covered so closely so many hours of the day, that care- 
ful bathing, rubbing and dressing are absolutely necessary. Careful bathing in water at 
body temperature relieves inflammation. A thorough rubbing in cocoa butter promotes 
good circulation, tends to relax the muscles, and makes the skin firm and well nourished. 
Corns will probably disappear when pressure or friction is removed. If it seems necessary 
to trim them, sterilize the knife, and do not trim too deeply, as a serious infection may re- 
sult. 



MISCELLANIES ON FEET 



Tender feet generally arise from the neglect of 
cleanliness, the use of thin cotton or silk stockings 
and boots or shoes that are either too stiff and 
tight or misshapen or not sufficiently porous to 
admit of the escape of perspiration. 

Tight boots and shoes, and water-proof ones, 
which are also air-tight, are the most common 
causes of tender feet; they also are the cause of 
headaches, dizziness, dyspepsia, diarrhoea and even 
apoplexy. Boots and shoes too narrow across the 
toes or the tread of the fool, or insufficiently long 
for ease and comfort, though large enough else- 
where, either cramp or distort the fore part of the 
foot and toes, or arrest the nails in their forward 
growth, forcing them back upon the sensitive flesh 
at their roots and sides and causing them to grow 
in thickness and width only — results which may be 
gradual but are aWays painful — usually the effect 
known as "ingrowing nails." 

Corns are pests that make a vixenish temper ex- 
cusable. Yet they are curable. The surest pre- 
ventive is a perfect-fitting shoe and absolute clean- 
liness. When they first arrive they may be kept 
quiet by tying the feet up at night with a piece 
of lemon over the offending member. Soak the 
next day in hot water. This, if repeated for sev- 
eral nights, will so soften the corn that it can be 
easily pinched out. Never cut a corn; blood poison 
is worse, on the whole, than a bad disposition and 
a scolded family. 

Tired Feet — Bathing the feet with alcohol when 
tired, or rubbing them with a little cocoa butter 
after a mustard bath, is restful. A wash of bran 
and soda will ease the "burn" of tired sore feet. 

Bath for the Feet — ^You may secure much com- 
fort for the feet by giving them a bath lasting 



at least 20 minutes in water which is kept con- 
stantly as hot as can be endured and to which has 
been added household ammonia in the proportion 
of a tablespoonful to every quart of water. After 
bath for ten minutes the feet should be rubbed 
under the water as vigorously and continuously as 
their tenderness ■will allow and wiped dry with a 
soft towel. 

To Keep Feet From Swelling — Dip the feet every 
night in hot water and rub them with vaseline. 
Don't wear the same pair of shoes two days in 
succession. 

The Toe Nails require attention the same as the 
finger nails, only they should never be cut down 
at the corners but nearly straight across; they 
should not extend beyond the flesh. The cuticle 
should be loosened after the bath, when it will peel 
off easily. 

Inflamed Joint — If the joint of the big toe be- 
comes inflamed, wear a shoe that is wide enough to 
keep the toes from being pinched together. Put 
a piece of absorbent cotton between the great and 
second toes, large enough to keep them apart; 
then take an adhesive plaster and bandage the 
ball of the foot firmly, holding the joint in place. 
By holding the joint in place with the plaster the 
inflammation will soon leave and it will become 
normal. 

Chilblains — A chilblain lotion that is found 
soothing is made from half an ounce of gylcerine 
and twenty grains each of tinctures of iodine and 
opium. It is kept over the places on bandages, 
the cloths never becoming dry. If the irritation is 
on the feet, woolen stockings should be worn, and 
the greatest care given not to getting the toes 
damp.

PERSONAL CLOTHING 

(Iowa State College Bulletin) 

Effect Upon Health — The entire body should be uniformly clothed. Materials 
differ in their ability to conduct heat. Poor conductors like fur and wool are most 
suitable for winter. Too much clothing causes waste of energy. Good conductors 
like linen, silk and cotton are best for summer. Black and dark shades of any 
color are warmer, because they have the power of holding the rays of sunlight. 
White has the power of refracting the rays of sunlight, hence keeps the body 
cooler. The garment that does not fit the body comfortably impairs the circu- 
lation and affects the general health. 

Effect Upon Character — Perfectly fitted, well-made clothing that is suitable in 
style, makes the wearer unconscious of her clothes. It makes her genuine and 
wholesome rather than careless, superficial and extravagant. 

Color and design are very important factors in dress. Poor material in gaudy 
colors is conspicuous. It indicates cheapness in the garment and lack of taste in 
the wearer. It should be avoided. Dull, ugly colors are depressing. Fabrics in 
soft, rich colors, harmoniously blended, are pleasing and modest. They are artistic 
and have a refining influence upon the appearance and character of the person wear- 
ing them. 

Care of Clothing — Clothing must be well aired, since damp garments remove too great 
an amount of heat from the body. The frequent airing and sunning helps to destroy dis- 
ease germs and to remove waste matter that has been thrown off by the skin. These wastes 
are scales from the skin, oily matter from the glands, and substances left on the surface 
by perspiration. All dust should be removed from the clothing, since dust may be an 
active carrier of disease germs. Clothing must be kept in proper place to prevent waste 
of time and loss of temper. Clothing must be kept in good repair for the same reasons. 

Purchase of Clothing — Before making a purchase, every woman should decide what 
style of garment is required, what materials will harmonize best ■with her present wardrobe, 
what amount of money may be spent and what quality of material should be secured from 
that expenditure. She should also know the amount of material required for each gar- 
ment. 

Suggestions — It pays to buy one good garment rather than two cheap ones. All wool 
fabrics wear well and do not fade or soil easily. The demand for woolen cloth exceeds 
the supply, hence many devices are used to make the supply go a long way and to deceive 
the buyer. 

Standard cotton materials wear well, are cheap, and plentiful. Cheap cotton mate- 
rials are often filled vfith starch and when washed are coarse and loosely woven. 

Do not buy fifteen-cent dress goods called "linen suitings." It is impossible to sell 
genuine linen at such a price. The fifteen-cent material is cotton, starched and glazed to make 
it look like linen. 

The quality of the material depends on the strength of the fibers, the fineness or coarse- 
ness of the fabric, its weave, color and method of finish. 



444 



PROPER ATTITUDE OF THE BODY 

(Iowa State College Bulletin) 

Chest — Cultivate the habit of holding the chest up and out. This enlarges the chest 
cavity and strengthens the lungs. It allows an increased amount of oxygen to enter the 
lungs and so aids in the oxidation of food. 

if the chest is raised the diaphragm is raised, and pressure is removed from the organs 
below the diaphragm. The habit of walking, sitting and standing with the chest dropped 
and sunken not only weakens the lungs, but it weakens the organs below the diaphragm, be- 
cause it throws too much weight upon them. 

It is also true that the raised chest gives one a feeling and appearance of courage and 
efficiency that can never be enjoyed by the person with the dropped and sunken chest. 

Shoulders — Hold the shoulders down and back. This position enlarges the chest cav- 
ity and so strengthens the entire body. 

Precautiorjs — Have the kitchen sink and the ironing table high enough to prevent the 
necessity of stooping. Stand erect while using the broom. Do not make the work more 
difficult by standing in an unnatural cramped position. 

Do not allow the child to acquire the habit of reading with the eyes too near the 
book. This not only injures the eyes, but it compresses the chest and weakens the organs 
below the diaphragm. 

Abdomen — Stand with the aWdomen "sucked in" and the chest forward. If the body 
is held in this position, the weight of the body will be thrown upon the ball of the foot and 
the body will be relieved of much jar. ;^^%i;';^' 

Prevention of Jar — The ball of the foot is a springy, elastic cushion which is intended 
to bear the weight of the body. Its elasticity prevents jar upon the spinal cord, while the 
habit of walking with full weight upon the heels throws much of the jar upon the delicate 
spinal cord that lies within the bony spinal column. Nature has also protected this deli- 
cate cord by placing spongy, bone cushions between the vertebrae of the spinal column. 

Walking Up Stairs — Stand erect, take a full breath, hold the chest out and the chin up. 
With the body in this position, climbing stairs is not difficult. It is only when the shoulders 
are bent, the diaphragm lowered, the chest compressed and the chin lowered that climbing 
stairs is difficult. 

Relaxation of Muscles — ^When a muscle is not in use, let it rest. The tightening of the 
muscles deprives the body of energy. Do not waste that energy. The muscles of the face 
can in no way aid in the process of walking and yet how frequently one sees the muscles of 
the face all tense and stiff as one walks along the street. Those rigid muscles mean en- 
ergy wasted. Learn to releix the muscles frequently. They become tired, just as the eye 
would if it were constantly contracted to decipher very fine print.

MOTHER AND BABY 

)ANDTHE GROWING CHILD C_ 




THE EXPECTANT MOTHER— HER FOOD 

Most of both the mental and physical suffering usual to the expectant 
mother — the fear and doubts, the helplessness, the hopelessness, as well as the 
headaches, dizziness, heart-burn, faintness and loss of appetite — spring from the 
same cause: the wrong food wrongly eaten, and the pampering and lack of exer- 
cise and fresh air to which the woman resigns herself as a matter of course. 

For ages, diet for the prospective mother has been based on superstition 
and old wives' tales. Both mother and child have suffered. Some women over- 
eat on the supposition that they must "feed two." Others actually starve them- 
selves in the belief that this will reduce the size of the baby or soften its bones, 
or perform some other imaginary function of worse than only imaginary desir- 
ability. 

Years ago midwives believed sick pregnancies the only safe ones, and were 
dubious over the mother who awaited the coming of her baby in health and con- 
tent. Science has dissipated such insanity. The safest and in every way desir- 
able delivery is the one approached with cheerfulness and in perfect health ; it will 
usually be attended with less pain and most probably free from unpleasant after- 
consequences. ; 

And the best means, practically the only means, for attaining this health 
and cheerfulness is moderate daily exercises in the open, fresh, clean air and out- 
of-doors — not over-exercise, of course, not jumping, running, climbing or lifting — 
and proper diet — with emphasis again on this item — proper diet. 

These things are essential to the health of a woman at all times ; but a 
woman w^ho during the most of her days may ignore the question of perfect 
health, will be pretty certain to crave it now, for her baby's sake as well as her 
own. And the secret of it is the same at this time as at any other — only this is 
the time when she will take notice of it. 

The woman must choose her food for its nutritive qualities rather than its 
quantity, and must eat inteligently — and again not too much. Her dizzy spells, heart- 

447 



448 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Section IX— MOTHER, BABY, CHILD 

burn, headaches and other ills, are almost all merely from indigestion. She does not 
take her usual exercise, and she is more subject than normal to indigestion. There 
are no special weird and mysterious differences in her functions due to the preg- 
nancy. 

Get that one sane fact well fixed in your mind, expectant one, and half 
your battle is over! Follow usual common sense in feeding yourself, only be a 
little more particular than ordinarily. Don't try to w^ork out mysterious, theoret- 
ical ideas of what the child needs — he needs what you need. Get yourself in per- 
fect physical trim and keep yourself so; feed yourself simple, wholesome, nourish- 
ing food such as agrees with you and builds up your health and strength. Nature 
•will select from the store of your ow^n nourishment what the child needs — and no 
more. Especially, however, don't over-eat — don't clog the system with too much, 
don't give it food too rich, until the intestines, poisoned, perhaps constipated, with 
undigested and indigestible matter, send back the poisons therefrom into the blood. 

All of which, after all, as above stated, resolves itself into simple rules you 
ought to observe all the time, but probably — ^w^ell don't, and more or less won't 
— except at this time for your baby's sake. 

A PROPERLY BALANCED DIET 

A balanced diet for the prospective mother — and for practically everybody else — 
should be about as follows (it will vary with different physical or digestive temperaments) : 

There should be some fresh (uncooked) food every day. This may be fruits or 
such vegetables as tomatoes and lettuce. Figs or evaporated prunes may take the place 
of fresh fruits if the latter are not always obtainable. Stewed fruits rank next. The seeds 
of berries should be removed by straining or otherwise. If raw apples, melons, pineapples, 
etc., cause indigestion, nine chances to one they are not properly masticated and if scraped 
or mashed instead of taken in bites or chunks the soft pulp will cause no distress whatever. 

Vegetables easily digested are w^hite and sweet potatoes thoroughly cooked and 
mashed or creamed, peas, rice, lima beans, onions, well cooked, tomatoes, carrots, aspara- 
gus, spinach, string beans, lettuce, beets, Brussels sprouts. 

Coarse cereals, such as oats, wheat, barley, are good breakfast foods. Breads are 
best if made from corn-meal and unbolted or whole wheat flour rather than fine white flour. 

In meats, chicken, turkey, beef, lamb and fish take leadership. 

Milk and eggs should lead over all ; they contain every property needed. They pall, 
however, if not varied with other foods. 

If you live in the country and have plenty of fresh eggs, milk, butter, vegetables, 
and a supply of chickens, you need not worry much about your diet as a prospective mother, 
except to see to the addition of some fruit and that you eat cornbread or whole wheat bread 
for about half of your bread indulgence. 

Summing up: The prospective mother, as well as every other woman, should have 
a diet of a little meat, a generous allowance of fruits and vegetables — and much water, milk 
(or other wholesome liquids) — and then — more water and more milk. 

ARRANGEMENT OF MEALS 

During the last two or three months of pregnancy, one rule usual at other times may 
be varied. When the child is attaining its greatest growth, the energy and strength of the 
mother is greatly drawn upon, and she begins to need more than normal nourishment. This 
should be met by eating oftener than three times a day — not by more abundant meals. The 
meals should all be light and simple. , 



MOTHER. BABY. CHILD— MOTHER 449 

For this period a good menu is about as follows: 

Breakfast — Fruit, egg or cereal, coarse bread, toasted or plain, beverage (preferably 
milk) — a very little coffee if a stimulant is needed. 

Mid-Forenoon — Milk, egg-nog (mild), gruel or broth, oatmeal or Graham wafers. 

Noon Meal — Meat, vegetables, salad with a simple cream dressing, light dessert, 
custard, fruit or ice. 

Mid-Afternoon — Grape juice or other fruit juice or fruit pulp, glass sweet milk or 
buttermilk, cracker or biscuit. 

Supper — Meat or consomme, fish, cold cereal, wafers, stewed fruit. 

Bed-Time — Milk (malted preferred), gruel of corn-meal, made with milk and water. 

At each of the above meals eat lightly and stop while still a little hungry.

FOR HIS MAJESTY HIMSELF 

Bed for Baby — A clothes basket makes an excellent bed for a young child. 
Choose the ordinary oblong basket and line it with pale blue silk or silesia, drawing 
the lining dow^n far enough to cover the outside and gathering it to fit neatly around 
the bottom. If desired, wadding may be placed between the basket and lining. 

Make a soft little mattress to fit the bottom, and sew^ around the edges of 
the basket a flounce of lace deep enough to nearly reach the floor. A dainty 
canopy may be made by shaping over one end of the basket wires or small willow 
boughs on which a piece of lace or swiss has been shirred; and the narrow ruffle 
of lace decorating the front edge of the canopy may be tied back with dainty blue 
ribbons. 

A Trunk for Baby's Clothes — A plain matting or cretonne covered shirtwaist box is 
the best kind of a trunk for baby. Get one about thirty inches long and sixteen wide. Make 
a tray twenty inches long and nail cleats inside the box to rest it on. It will slide back and 
forth and can be removed without effort. The tray holds a pin cushion, soap, toilet articles, 
etc., while there is abundant room for clothing in the bottom. 

The ChOd's Bath — One can introduce play and fancy into so many things connected 
with the daily necessaries that are often so disagreeable to children. What ordeal is worse 
for the average child than being "scrubbed"? 

A Pretty Towel embroidered in yellow ducks affords an element of attraction in the 
bathing hour; if done in the simple tapestry stitch the embroidering of the ducks will take 
but a short time. Sometimes towels can be obtained already stamped for the illustration; if 
one cannot be found, trace it with carbon upon the towel. Work over the outline thus, 
transferred in yellow, insert a black eye, and the duck is complete. One duck placed after 
the other, in a line, and a blue patch of tapestry stitch at the end of the towel will make 
the ducks appear as though they are waddling toward a pond. The towel can be simply 
hemmed, hemstitched or scalloped, and buttonhole stitched in white mercerized twist. 

The Small Washcloths can be decorated with a fish in outline stitch or a tiny boat. 
A make-believe game of "Going to the Seashore" will ofttimes bring an otherwise reluctant 
child willingly to the dreaded tub. 

If the child is quite small, a rubber doll that he may take into the tub with him will 
give untold delight. 

Diet for Young Children — Questions are often asked as to exactly what a child may 
be allowed to eat during the period between the first and second birthdays. There are cer- 
tain broad rules which can be laid down. Milk looms large as a food — not as a drink, please, 
for which plain water should be given — with broth, gravy, boiled fish and chicken, bread 
crumbs soaked in bacon fat, a properly boiled egg or only the yolk, if the white has been 
allowed to get tough and hard, and always some rusks to chew and nibble. 

Vegetables Valuable — At eighteen months old a further stride can be made, and 
mutton or broth freshly roasted may be given, first in small quantities. Here you will gen- 
erally find it best to pound the meat. However, if the child has the inestimable advantage 
of a good digestion (which it should have, barring some hereditary delicacy or the sad re- 
sults of bad treatment) and has learned already to eat slowly and bite its food properly, 
there is no reason why the meat should not be given simply cut up. It is far better then,

452 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Section IX— MOTHER. BABY, CHILD 

for the child is using the teeth as well as accustoming himself to eat properly, and although 
it takes a little longer for the feeding process the time is well spent. 

It should be the aim of every one in charge of children at this age to make their 
little charges form the habit of eating slowly and masticating properly. Any amount of after 
trouble caused by the bolting of food will then be saved. 

By the time a child is two, vegetables may be made to play their own part — both 
potatoes and green vegetables. The latter usually have to be introduced somewhat care- 
fully and in small quantities, for children as a rule dislike them. Potatoes should be care- 
fully cooked, and it may be well to remember that the most valuable part, from the point 
of view of the growing organism, at least, is that which lies quite close to the skin, where 
only the salts so much needed are found, and this part, unfortunately, is too often peeled 
off and thrown away. 

Fruit, too, is permissible after the second birthday, if properly prepared and in good 
condition. Of course, it is often given before, but generally speaking the second birthday 
rule is a wise one. An exception may be made in favor of a slice of ripe apple, which forms 
an excellent safeguard to the teeth if eaten at the end of a meal, especially one which other- 
wise ends with soft or sweet food; and, of course, fruit juice should have been well repre- 
sented in the dietary all along. 

Starchy Food Dangerous — Just a word about milk puddings. The ordinary ones 
rice, tapioca, sago, and so on — are all simply forms of starchy food, and this is an ele- 
ment to diet which may very easily be overdone. Far more children suffer from indigestion 
from an excess of starch than is commonly realized. Indeed, usually the first thing done in 
home doctoring of the child, when digestive disturbance manifests itself, is to cut off meat or 
its equivalents and keep the child on farinaceous food, whereas precisely the opposite course 
should be followed. 

Hints for Mothers — Keep your baby away from sick people and out of crowds. 
Do not try to teach baby to stand. A healthy baby will stand and walk when strong enough 
to do so. 

Visit the school where you send your children, and satisfy yourself that it is sani- 
tary, properly heated, lighted and ventilated and not overcrowded. 

Give each child who goes to school a pretty folding drinking cup or a supply of 
individual paper cups. 

BABY'S HRST TEETH 

The embryonic teeth begin to develop at least six months before birth. It is prob- 
able that a nutritious diet for the prospective mother lays the foundation for healthy teeth 
in the baby and that lack of proper food for the mother may deprive both her own and 
the baby's teeth of some part of their normal vigor. 

Every child has two sets of teeth. The first set, known as the deciduous or "milk" 
teeth, is replaced beginning at about the sixth year with the permanent or "second teeth." 
Nearly all so-called "teething" troubles belong to the first period, as a disturbance is rarely 
connected with the coming of the permanent set. 

At birth each tiny tooth of both sets lies partly imbedded in a cavity of the jaw-bone, 
covered and surrounded by the softer tissues of the gum. As the baby grows, the teeth 
grow also, and if the baby is healthy they are ready to cut through the gums beginning at 
about the seventh month of life. 

There are twenty of the milk teeth, five in each half-jaw. The teeth appear in groups 
of five to eight weeks; after the second, a pause of one to three months; after the third, one 



MOTHER. BABY. CHILD— CHILD'S TEETH 



453 



of from two to three months; after the fourth, one of from two to four months. Thus, by 
the time a baby is one year old, it may have six teeth; at one and one-half years there should 
be twelve; at two years, sixteen teeth; and at two and one-half years the entire set should 
be cut. 

There is considerable variation, both as to the order in which they appear and in 
the time, so that the mother need not be alarmed if her baby does not follow the average 
as stated, but if the baby has no teeth at the end of the first year it can hardly be said to 
be developing properly; probably the diet is at fault, or some disease is retarding the growth 
of the baby in general, and the doctor should be consulted. 

THE CARE OF THE GROWING CHILD'S TEETH 

(U. S. Department of Labor, Children's Bureau) 

By the end of the second year the baby should have his milk teeth complete 
and until the sixth or seventh year, when the permanent set will begin to appear. 
These teeth must serve all the purposes that the final set will serve later. Since this 
is the time the child is learning to chew^ his food, a process necessary not only for 
proper digestion but for the strengthening and developing of his jaws and for the 
proper growth of the permanent teeth, it is important to keep the first teeth in the 
best possible working order. The condition of the teeth is a fair index to the general 
health of the child. '■ 



Until the child is old enough to use a toothbrush 
himself, the mother should wash his teeth every 
day; but as early as possible the child should 
learn to care for his own teeth. If the teeth can- 
not conveniently be cleaned after each meal, the 
mouth may at least be rinsed. Children should 
be taught that it is of special importance to wash 
the teeth and mouth after eating nuts, or any 
sweet, sticky, or pasty food. The teeth should be 
carefully cleaned at bedtime, since the fermenta- 
tion of food particles left in the mouth, which leads 
to the decay of the teeth, proceeds more rapidly 
at night, when the mouth is still. 

The child should be taught to brush the teeth 
from the gum downward or upward toward the 
cutting edge. When the teeth are brushed cross- 
wise, the tendency is to push whatever is on them 
into the cracks and crevices of the teeth or under 
the edges of the gums. The inner surfaces of the 
teeth should also be brushed up and down, and 
the grinding surfaces should be scrubbed in all 
directions: after the scrubbing is finished the mouth 
should be thoroughly rinsed with warnx water. 

Some hard food, like a stalk of celery or part 
of a ripe, juicy apple, eaten at the end of a meal 
scours the surface of the teeth and leaves a fresh 
clean taste in the niouth. 



Children should be taken regularly to a good 
dentist once or twice a year after the first set of 
teeth is complete. If cavities appear they should 
be filled with soft fillings, and each tooth should 
be saved as long as possible. If the temporary 
molars are extracted before the sixth year molars 
come in, the latter ^vill be apt to crowd forward 
into the space left vacant, and when the later 
teeth come they will be pushed out of their regular 
places, destroying the natural line of the mouth. 
The first molars furnish the grinding surfaces neces- 
sary to proper chewing of the food. If they fall 
out too soon the child is hardly able to chew hard 
or tough food, and is likely to swallow such food 
in chunks. 

The care of the child's first teeth is important 
also because the health of the permanent set is 
largely dependent upon that of the first set. The 
second teeth are much larger than the first, and, 
consequently, need more room in the gum. For 
necessary development the jaws must be given 
plenty of exercise. Consequently, the child should 
have a mixed diet, including some hard food 
which he cannot swallow without chewing. Toast, 
crusts, hard crackers, certain fruits, like apples, 
salad, vegetables, and meats, should provide the 
food elements needed for healthy teeth if the child 
is thriving.

FOOD FOR YOUNG CHILDREN 

(Extracts from Farmers' Bulletin No. 717, U. S. Department of Agriculture) 

A little child who is carefully fed in accordance with his bodily needs (as 
these are now understood) receives every day at least one food from each of the 
following groups: 

1 . Milk and dishes made chiefly of milk (most important of 

the group as regards children's diet) ; meat, fish, poul- 
try, eggs and meat substitutes. 

2. Bread and other cereal foods. 

3. Butter and other wholesome fats. 

4. Vegetables and fruits. 

5. Simple sweets. 

As to the amounts that should be served, a good rule is to provide three 
or four glasses (IJ/z pints to I quart) of milk a day; an egg or its equivalent in 
moderately fat meat, fish, poultry or meat substitute; fruit and vegetables each 
once a day; I to 2 ounces of butter or other wholesome fat; and all the bread or 
other cereal food the child will eat. One or two ounces of sugar, candy or other 
sweet (including the sugar used in cooking) may also be allowed, if this does not 
prevent eating the other foods mentioned.

A REVIEW OF THE DAY 

At the close of the day the mother might ask herself questions like the following to make sure 
that she has taken into account the things to which her attention has been directed: 

Did the child take about a quart of milk in one form or another) 

Have I taken pains to see that the milk that comes to my house has been handled in a clean way) 

If I was obliged to serve skim milk for the sake of cleanliness or economy, did I supply a little 

extra fat in some other way) 
Were the fats which I gave the child of the wholesome kind found in milk, cream, butter, and 

salad oils, or of the unwholesome kind found in doughnuts and other fried foods) 
Did I make good use of all skim milk by using it in the preparation of cereal mushes, puddings, 

or otherwise) 
Were all cereal foods thoroughly cooked) 
Was the bread soggy) If so, was it because the loaves were too large, or because they were not 

cooked long enough) 
Did I take pains to get a variety of foods from the cereal group by serving a cereal mush once 

during the day) 
Did I keep in mind that while cereals are good foods in themselves, they do not take the place 

of meat, milk, eggs, fruit, and vegetables) 
Did I keep in mind that children who do not have plenty of fruit and vegetables need whole- 
wheat bread and whole grains served in other ways) 
Did each child have an egg or an equivalent amount of meat, fish, or poultry) 
Did any child have more than this of flesh foods or eggs) If so, might the money not have been 

better spent for fruits or vegetables) 
If I was unable to get milk, meat, fish, poultry, or eggs, did I serve dried beans, or other legumes 

thoroughly cooked and carefully seasoned) 
Were vegetables and fruits both on the child's bill of fare once during the day) If not, was it 

because we have not taken pains to raise them in our home garden) 



MOTHER. BABY. CHILD— FOOD FOR YOUNG CHILDREN 45 7 

Did either the fruit or the vegetable disagree with the child > If so, ought I to have cooked it 

more thoroughly, chopped it more finely, or have removed the skins or seeds) 
Was the child given sweets between meals, or anything that tempted him to eat when he was not 

hungry) 
Was he allowed to eat sweets when he should have been drinking milk or eating cereals, meat, 

eggs, fruit, or vegetables) 
Were the sweets given to the child simple, i.e., unmixed with much fat or with hard substances 

difficult to chew, and not highly flavored) 
Was the child made to eat slowly and chew his food properly) 

A young child may be considered well fed if he has plenty of milk, bread, and other cereal food; 
an egg once a day or its equivalent in flesh foods; a small portion each of carefully prepared fruits and 
vegetables, with a small amount of sweet food after his appetite for other foods is satisfied. If there is 
too much or too little of any of these, his diet is one-sided.

(From bulletin of U. S. Department of Labor, Washington) 

FEEDING THE CHILD THE SECOND YEAR 

Much of the illness and suffering among babies commonly attributed to 
the "second summer" or to teething is actually due to errors in feeding. The baby's 
delicate digestive mechanism, accustomed to dealing only with milk, cannot all at 
once undertake the task of adjustment to a varied diet of solid foods, but must be 
strengthened by the gradual addition of new foods until the organs are trained to 
more complicated operations. The safe rule for feeding the baby is to add but 
one new food at a time to his dietary; to watch carefully the effect of each one 
and to withdraw it and return to the simpler diet at the first sign of trouble. These 
rules are particularly important in summer, when a baby is more readily upset. 



The following list sho^vs the day's meals for a 
baby in his second year: 

7 a. m. Milk, zwieback, toast, or dried bread. 

9 a. m. — Orange juice. 
10 a. m. — Cereal, cup of milk. 
2 p. m. — Broth, meat, vegetables, stale bread, 

baked apple. 
6 p. m. — Cereal, milk, toast or bread. 
10 p. m. — Milk (may be omitted). 

Milk — At this time the baby should be taking 
about one quart of milk in 24 hours; part of this 
may be poured over the cereal. 

Cereals Oatmeal should be cooked three hours 

with a little salt in the water. It should be 
served without sugar, or with a very little only. 
The lighter cereals should be cooked at least an 
hour. • 

Breads — Bread for young children must have 
been thoroughly baked and should be quite dry 
when used; that is, at least two days old. Tender 
toast is made by cutting thin slices from such a 
loaf and allowing them to dry still more, then 
toasting them to a delicate brown over a quick 
lire. Toast thus made is crisp all the way through 



and may be used in many ways. Many children 
will like to eat it broken into bits in broth or milk. 
Hot breads and biscuits, griddle cakes, and muffins 
are not suitable for young children. 

Fruit — ^The child may have a small portion of 
baked apple or prunes once a day in addition to 
his morning feeding of orange juice. The apple 
should be baked very tender, and all the akin, 
seeds, and hard parts should be removed. Prunes 
should be very carefully washed, soaked all night, 
then cooked until very tender with very little sugar. 
A small portion of the strained pulp may be given 
instead of apple, and the juice may be used also. 

Meat — The child may have about a tablespoon- 
ful of scraped meat, or a soft boiled or coddled 
egg once a day. Beef, broiled, boiled, or roasted, 
the tender part of a lamb-chop, or the delicate 
meat of chicken or fish may be used. All meat 
should be scraped or minced very line, as no child 
of this age can be trusted to chew it properly. 

Vegetables — A small portion of some properly 
cooked green vegetables, like spinach or tender 
string beans, may be given. Such vegetables 
should be fresh. They should be cooked, then 
drained and mashed or strained through a colander*

THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Section IX— MOTHER, BABY, CHILD 



FEEDING THE CHILD OF THREE 

(Bulletin, Children's Bureau) 

At the beginning of the third year the child's diet may be increased by 
adding more solid food, especially meats and vegetables. According to the U. S. 
Department of Agriculture, every healthy child of three should have at least one 
food a day from each of the following five groups: 

1 . Milk and dishes made chiefly of milk (most important of 

this group in children's diet) ; meat, fish, poultry, and 
eggs. 

2. Bread and other cereal foods. 

3. Butter and other wholesome fats. 

4. Vegetables and fruits. 

5. Simple sweets. 



The meats should be beef, boiled, broiled, or 
roasted; Iamb chops; the white meat of chicken or 
delicate fish. All meat should be free from fat, 
gristle, or bone and finely minced when given to 
the child. 

Eggs should be very soft boiled, coddled, or 
poached, or soft scrambled. Fried eggs should 
never be given to a child; but the grated or mashed 
yolk of a very hard boiled egg may sometimes be 
used. 

Meat broths made from mutton, beef, or chicken 
have little nutriment, but if these are thickened 
with arrowroot or cornstarch, and especially if 
milk is added, they become a valuable food Well- 
cooked vegetables, strained and added to warm 
milk, are not only good foods but serve to teach 
the child to like vegetables. 

Cereals should be thoroughly cooked and served 
with milk or thiii cream and a very small amount 
of sugar or none. 

Bread for a child should be at least tvtro days 
old. Toast, zwieback, or hard crackers may be 
given once or twice a day. 

Baked potatoes moistened with a little butter. 



thin cream, beef juice, or platter gravy may be 
given. 

Asparagus tips, spinach, stewed celery, squash, 
string beans, carrots, young peas, well-cooked and 
mashed, or put through a puree sieve, are all good 
for a child. A small portion of one of these vege- 
tables may be a part of the child's dinner each 
day. 

Fruits should be continually used. At this age 
sweet oranges, baked apples, or stewed prunes are 
most useful. The juice or mashed pulp of fresh 
ripe pears or peaches may be given in the third 
year, but there is much danger in using overripe 
or green fruit, as well as in giving too much. It 
is especially necessary to be careful in hot weather 
v^hen fresh fruit decays rapidly. Bananas should 
never be given to a young child. * 

A child under 4 years of age should never have 
dried or salted meats, sausage, pork, game, liver, 
kidney, goose, or duck. Fried and raw vegetables, 
hot fresh breads, cakes, and pastries, salads, candy, 
syrups, tea, coffee, beer, cider, and soda water are 
all unsuitable foods for a child.

FEEDING THE CHILD OF FOUR. 

(Bulletin. Children's Bureau) 

During the fourth year, milk still remains an important part of the child's 
food, but much of it may now be given in the form of bread and milk, milk soups, 
or milk puddings, or it may be poured over the cereal. Some children object to 
drinking milk, and in such cases it is wise to offer it under some such disguise. 
The cereal need no longer be strained, but must be very thoroughly cooked. 



The diet at this time should include all the ar- 
ticles advised for the two earlier years, with the 
addition, of more meats, vegetables, and fruits. 
Baked potatoes, with a little butter, are a staple 
food at this period. Bread and butter, or toast 
and butter, and plenty of hard crusts or zwieback 
are important. Eggs or meat, such as roasted, 
boiled, or broiled beef, mutton, chicken or fish, 
should be given at least once a day. 

The child of four will probably thrive on three 
or four meals a day. the heaviest being taken in 
the middle of the day. If he appears to be hungry, 
a light lunch, such as milk, may be given in the 
interval between breakfast and dinner, or between 
dinner and supper, but no nibbling should be per- 
mitted between meals. A child should be taught 
to come to the table with that vigorous appetite 
for his food which leads to good digestion and 
assimilation. 

Food should be carefully prepared to fit it to a 
child's powers and should be served in an appe- 
tizing fashion at proper intervals. Young children 
should not be offered "tastes" of the family meals, 
as this habit tends to destroy the appetite for the 
simple, rather restricted diet adapted to their need. 

Children should have an abundance of pure, cool 
drinking water. This is especially important in 
summer, when they are perspiring freely. If there 
is any doubt about the purity of the water it should 
be filtered or boiled, or both. 

Since it is always difficult for children to chew 
their food properly, it should be finely minced, 



mashed, or softened for them throughout these 
early years. 

Never under any circumstances should children 
be given coffee, tea, or strong cocoa. They should 
have no highly seasoned or spiced foods, rich 
pastries, raw vegetables, onions, corn, or cabbage. 
Bananas and all partly ripened fruit are apt to 
make trouble. 

If children are inclined to be constipated, they 
should have plenty of laxative foods. These are 
cereals, particularly oatmeal; the coarser breads, 
such as Graham and whole wheat; fruit and fruit 
juice, particularly oranges and prunes; and vege- 
tables like string beans, asparagus, and spinach. 

Many children suffer from malnutrition; that is, 
they fail to secure the food materials they need for 
development and growth, and. consequently, they 
are undersized, pale, often slow and listless, and 
do not show the eager, alert habits of healthy 
children. Malnutrition may be due to lack of 
sufficient food of any kind, to improper food, bad 
cooking, or some fault of digestion, or to illness 
which makes it impossible for the child properly 
to utilize the food he eats. 

It is a wise precaution, therefore, if children are 
out of sorts, have decayed teeth, bad breath, or 
seem tired and disinclined to play, to have them 
examined by a good doctor, and to take all the 
trouble necessary to get them into sound eating 
habits. The neglect of these early symptoms may 
mean a lifetime of only partial health and efficiency.

FEEDING THE CHILD OF SIX 

(Iowa State College Bulletin) 

Children need mineral matter to build strong bones and good teeth. Do 
not handicap them for life by neglecting to supply these important food sub- 
stances. , 

Eggs and milk are valuable muscle building foods. A quart of milk a 
day included in the diet will help a child to make normal growth. 

The child beginning school should be carefully watched to see that he keeps 
up to a normal standard of health under the new conditions. 

A child should be taught : 

To chew his food thoroughly. 

Not to touch food with dirty hands. 

Not to eat foods that have been exposed to dust and flies. 

To use his own drinking cup. 



FOODS SUITABLE FOR THE CHILD OF SIX 

Breakfast — Cereals with cream, eggs (not fried), 
stewed (ruits, oranges, toast (dry or milk), rice 
with cream, bacon. 

Protein Foods — Creamed eggs, macaroni with 
cheese, creamed potatoes with peanuts, chicken, 
beef, mutton, creamed codfish. 

Vegetables — Baked potatoes, lettuce, carrots, 
creamed onions, green peas, string beans, as- 
paragus. 

Desserts Junket, custard, rice pudding, plain 

ice cream, sponge cake, plain cookies, fruit jelly, 
fruit gelatin with cream, fresh fruits. 

FOODS RICH IN MINERALS 

Eggs, milk, spinach, pea puree (dried peas), 
celery, ground raisins, prunes, whole wheat bread, 
nut bread (whole wheat), cauliflower. 



SUGGESTIVE MENUS 
Breakfast — Stewed prunes, oatmeal and cream, 
toast, milk.

MOTHER. BABY. CHILD— CLOTHING FOR THE CHILD 



465 



CLOTHES FOR THE GROWING CHILD 

(U. S. Department of Labor. Children's Bureau) 

Very much of the comfort of a child depends upon his having the right kind 
of clothing. This is especially true in summer. One hot day a mother came into 
an infant-welfare station in a large city bringing a screaming baby who would not 
be pacified. The trained and sympathetic eye of the nurse in charge saw that the 
little feet were covered with knitted woolen socks. She asked the mother to take 
them off. Immediately the screams ceased and the baby stretched his naked feet in 
delight at being relieved of the intolerable irritation. 



During the hot months, children should wear 
just as little clothing as possible. Babies require 
only a diaper and one other garment, while run- 
about babies and children up to five will be amply 
clothed in waist and drawers, with one outer gar- 
ment, preferably a cotton slip, apron, or rompers, 
or one of the many similar garments illustrated in 
the pattern books. 

The one-piece dress is a great boon to busy 
mothers, being easy to make and to wash and 
iron. If the kimono sleeve is used, the dress will 
be cooler, but in some garments the set-in sleeve 
is less clumsy and wears better. Rompers, loose 
at the knee and low-necked and short-sleeved, may 
be used for little girls and boys alike. Denim 
overalls are rather cumbersome for the hottest 
weather but are adapted to cool days. 

Starched, frilled, and fussy garments are all 
alike unsuitable for young children, whose clothing 
should be such as will make them perfectly com- 
fortable and permit the freest play. No child 
should have to think of his garments during the 
play hours; he should, of course, be subject to 
reasonable restrictions upon wilful or mischievous 
soiling or destruction of his clothing. 



Cotton is the best material for outside garments, 
since a child of this age should have no clothes 
that cannot be washed. Mothers disagree as to 
the comparative merits of white clothing and col- 
ored. White garments may be boiled, and thus 
the amount of rubbing necessary to get them clean 
is very greatly lessened. On the other hand, white 
dresses are soiled almost as soon as the child be- 
gins to play out of doors. It must be remembered 
that whild white or light colors show the soil 
sooner, there may be just as much actual dirt on 
the darker ones. It must also be remembered that 
light colors like blue, green, lavender, or pink are 
almost certain to fade unless they are washed with 
special care. Striped and check ginghams fade 
less than plain materials, but often shrink badly in 
washing. Such materials should be shrunk before 
being made up. Seersucker and cotton crepe ma- 
terials of many kinds have the great advantage of 
needing no ironing. These rough materials are not 
very cool, and if used for summer wear should 
have short sleeves and round neck to avoid chafing 
of the skin of the arms and neck. Percale, galatea, 
madras, and the better grades of gingham or dress 
linen are all good materials for children's clothes. 
For hot weather almost any of the thin materials 
may be used.

THE INDOOR GARDEN 

iCUT FLOWERS 



y 



Every house should have growing things ^£^ 
within. Where it is possible to have an outdoor gar- 
den, one confronts, of course, unlimited possibilities 
which embrace a study in themselves. 



dJ 



When one is confined to indoor gardening, however, «-\53 
it is astonishing how much may be accomplished. This 
most naturally and conveniently takes the form of the win- 
dow^ box, sun room box, or perhaps piazza box ; it is a constant source 
of surprise to work out how much can be grown in these to add to 
the charm of a home and make it seem that some of "God's out-of- 
doors" has been brought within. 

The boxes are heavy when filled with earth, hence should be made not too 
large. It is better to place two boxes end to end to fill a long space. They should 
be supported through with strong brackets. Tliere must be holes in the bottom 
for drainage, or the earth will turn "sour;" there must be, therefore, a pan or 
other means to catch the drain and either carry it off or hold it until it dries or is 
mopped up. The boxes should be painted every two years — the color of the house 
or other woodwork next them, as it is the flowers which we want to "stand out" for 
notice, not the receptacles. 

In the bottom of the boxes should be an inch layer of gravel, charcoal, 
broken up flower pots or other coarse material; charcoal is best, as it helps sweeten 
the soil. The soil should be sifted; it should be obtained from a florist or should 
be made up of a mixture of humus, fine sand, rich garden soil and old stable dress- 
ing, well rotted from the cow barn. Sods may be overturned and the soil scraped 
therefrom, instead of garden soil; and bone meal is even better than stable dressing. 
The garden soil should make up about half the quantity, humus about a fourth, 
sand and fertilizer in smaller amounts. Wood ashes or chimney soot may be added, 
but not coal ashes. The w^hole should be w^ell mixed and by frequent turning ex- 
posed to light and rain and much sun, to "season" somewhat before using. 

Set the edge plants first, those chosen to droop over the sides, such as peri- 
winkle, sweet alyssium, moneywort, etc. If the plants to be set in a bed are of 
uneven growth, place the taller ones at the ends, especially if a w^indow^ box.

The plants to select depend upon your own taste, but the background can- 
not be disregarded. On a gray house, red geraniums look well, or there are fine 
shades in pink and salmon. These colors do not look well together ; only strongly 
contrasted colors do, and not always these — white and red geraniums are too 
strong a contrast, while white goes well with pink. White flowers look especially 
well in window boxes in the evening, w^hen they shine out brightly in the dusky 
light. 

Flowers and Children — Possibly the city child finds growing plants a more wonderful 
something than the child of the country, but a window box in the nursery is an unfailing 
delight to any child — and the child miay be taught to water and tend it; and little formal 
gardens, Japanese or others, may be obtained from any city florist, all ready to transport 
bodily to the home, for nursery or for the living room. Tiny ones for the dining table are 
becoming more and more frequently seen, perhaps one of the most charming table decora- 
tions it is possible to have. 

Bulbs Indoors — Bulbs planted and grown at home are far more satisfactory than 
those bought ready to blossom. The latter have usually been "forced," are not hardy and 
will wither under any slightly adverse conditions. Buy large bulbs, not small ones; the 
latter cannot be forced and will not make large, attractive plants; all the care you can give 
them will not bring forth more blossoms than are inherently in them. 

Bulbs run through quite a list; tulips, daffodils, jonquils, narcissus, crocuses, and 
Roman and Dutch hyacinths. Consult florist from whom you buy as to how many of a given 
variety to plant in a given sized pot or box and the time required for them to grow and 
blossom; then select a variety so planned and planted that one will follow another and 
you will have some abloom throughout all the season. The florist will also instruct you as 
to soiling and 'which bulbs require much or little watering when in their growing stage. 

When you plant them for rooting, label them. Put them in a dark closet. Water 
occasionally if the soil and bulbs seem dry. Some varieties will root in two weeks; others 
require up to four weeks. When removed from the dark closet, put them in a dull light, 
to start their gro^vth slowly; forced in a strong light they will make all foliage and no 
blossoms. Leave them in the dull light for a week or ten days. 

When you transfer to the window, give them a sunny room but not the direct sun 
all the time. If forced too fast, by too much bright sun and too warm a room, they make 
long, spindly trunks and all leaves, with few blossoms, and they do not last as long as those 
grown more normally. 

The Chinese lilies grown in 'water are treated about the same as bulbs grown in 
soil. Rocks or pebbles in the water are to hold them in position and give their roots some- 
thing to grasp; the pebbles do not nourish them. Smooth, clean, fairly large pebbles an 
inch or more in size are best. 

All Flowers grown in a gas lighted room, or a room with a gas heater without out- 
side vent pipe, or in a very hot room of "dry" heat, are sensitive, do not do so well as 
otherwise, and positively must have their "faces washed" (the foliage washed do'wn thor- 
oughly) every day or two. 

Ferns and Kindred Plants — Ferns will keep in furnace heated rooms if sufficiently 
and properly watered. The Boston fern is one of the best for the purpose. 

Horseradish does well and looks well until it gets too large and harsh; it grows 
rapidly and is beautiful when young.

Parsley does well in window boxes and is decorative both there and on the meat 
platter. Some varieties of mint do well, especially mentha, which is also used for a delicious 
adjunct to iced drinks. 

Beyond the above the possibilities of indoor gardening run into opportunities of 
almost countless variety to one who will take up the art and study it out. The items here 
are only to give one a fair start along the lines simplest and easiest for beginners. 

There are wonderful possibilities in common carrots, and radishes and even beets 
are decorative as well as useful. Nasturtiums and geraniums, heliotrope, mignonette, prim- 
roses, morning glories, pansies, violets, foliage, asparagus, petunias — all are readily grown 
in window boxes both within and without the casement. 

Simple, Homely "Hanging" Plants — For a boy who loves an experiment, take a 
fat carrot and cut off its tail. Of course, the grocer has already cut off its head. Now 
scrape an opening in the top about as large as a good sized spool. Pierce the rim of the 
opening at three equi-distant points and run a string through each hole, catching the three 
strings together to form a miniature hanging basket. Hang it in a sunny window and fill it 
with water. Keep it filled — and you will be rewarded with an adorable green fernery which 
■will sprout from the outside and entirely hide the carrot itself. 

Here's another hanging basket: Put a small sweet potato in a wide-mouthed bottle. 
Cut a hole in a sponge large enough for the mouth of the bottle to come through. In all the 
little holes of the sponge sow rice or bird seed. Hang it in a dark place by strings to the 
neck of the bottle, until all have sprouted. Put in a sunny window and train the potato 
vine around the strings.

THE DECORATIVE USE OF FLOWERS 

Being Extracts from Bulletin Under the Above Title Issued as Farm House Series, No. 8, 
Cornell Reading Course, State Department of Agriculture, Ithaca, N. Y. 

With no consideration of the part that structure and odor of flowers play 
in the perpetuation of plants, or their value as reservoirs of honey or as store- 
houses of medicine, this lesson deals with only their aesthetic service, "To 
minister delight to man, to beautify the earth." 

The term flowers, as used in the title of this lesson, refers not only to blos- 
soms, but to leaves, berries, seed packs, and any other form of plant life that has 
decorative qualities. An arrangement of flowers may be a work of art in which 
every essential of design in form and color may be exemplified. 

TO KEEP FLOWERS 

In order that flowers may keep, as well as to protect the plants, flowers should be 
cut, not picked nor "pulled," preferably in the morning or the evening. When cut they 
should be plunged as soon as possible into deep water and allowed to stand in a cool room 
or cellar for two or three hours before they are arranged. If some time elapses before they 
are arranged, it is better to snip the ends of the stems again. They should be placed so 
that the blossoms are supported, especially if they are fragile; often long-stemmed blossoms 
will keep much longer if "rested" in this way during the night. 

Flowers stay fresh much longer if the temperature in which they are grown can be 
maintained. Sometimes such flowers as heliotrope and dahlias will keep much longer if the 
stems are thrust into boiling water or into a direct flame for a moment, and immediately 
after plunged into cold water. Green branches cut in winter should be placed in ice water. 

Flowers keep fresh longer if the leaves below the water are removed, for the decay- 
ing vegetable matter poisons the water. If glass vases are used it would not, of course, be 
advisable to strip the leaves from the stems, but the water should be changed very fre- 
quently. The ends of the stems should not rest on the bottom of the container. With a 
large surface of water exposed to the air flowers will remain fresh longer than when the 
surface is small and confined. 

EFFECTIVE PLACING 

The placing of an arrangement of flowers often determines its form; therefore the 
position it is to occupy should be considered from the first. The observer's point of view 
should influence the arrangement. Some plants look their best in a jar placed on the floor. 
Pond lilies never look so well as when floating in a shallow dish on a taboret or a stand 
that is lower than an ordinary table. Some plants or bouquets are most attractive when 
placed on a window sill and silhouetted against the light. White lilies or golden glow light 
up a dark corner effectively. Drooping branches or vines arrange themselves naturally when 
placed on a mantelpiece or in baskets or other receptacles hung against the wall. Various 
flowers suit various moods, different occasions, different rooms. TTie flowers that supply the 
most charming and intimate features of the home breakfast table would probably be out of 
place at a banquet. 

TABLE DECORATION 

No phase of flower arrangement is more constantly recurring than that of table 
decoration. Beauty resides in quality rather than in quantity, and it is often more in evi- 
dence when stem and leaf and growth are seen than when these have been obliterated by 

471 



472 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Sec. X— INDOOR GARDEN, CUT FLOWERS 

a mere mass of color. Table decoration should be so low that conversation may be gen- 
eral, and so that persons sitting opposite each other need not play hide and seek. Flowers 
with a very delicate odor, or with no odor at all, should be selected for the table. There 
may be either a central arrangement or something at each plate, or, for a very special occa- 
sion, a combination of both. Little flat water cups cost only forty cents a dozan and are 
very appropriate for certain flowers. For a small table there may be a central arrangement 
and others that are subordinate. The shape of the centerpiece should repeat the shape of 
the table; it should be round for a round table, or long and narrow if the table is that shape. 
The color of the flowers should harmonize with the color of the china and of the room. 

The decorations should be appropriate to the occasion and should reflect its spirit. 
Forget-me-nots, daisies, and buttercups are suitable for the child's birthday; rosebuds, wild 
clematis, or virgin's bower, sweet peas and daffodils for a young girl, unless lilies, marigolds, 
black-eyed susans, peach blossoms, iris or other flowers in season happen to have a happier 
significance. Bride's roses, lilies of the valley, apple, peach, or any other fruit blossoms, 
are a good selection for the bride. For the mother's birthday, violets, many of the roses, 
and other flowers, among which her favorites should be given first choice, would be appro- 
priate. Bachelor's buttons, sweet williams, or johnny-jump-ups may suitably celebrate the 
young man's coming of age. Laurel, oak leaves, chrysanthemums (a court flower) and other 
stately blossoms would be appropriate decorations for a dinner. 

MANNER OF ARRANGEMENT 

The decorative elements in plants are line, form and color. Those plants whose 
chief attraction is in form or line should be used singly or in small groups, so that these 
qualities may be seen to best advantage. Those whose pre-eminent attraction is their 
color may be massed. Those ■which are thrice blessed, possessing beauty of form, line and 
color, may be arranged singly, in small groups, or in large masses, according to the charac- 
teristic to be emphasized or the place and purpose for which they are chosen. 

Line is the dominant attribute of goldenrod. One stem, or at most three, is more 
effective than a large mass. When goldenrod is bunched in the usual manner, the forceful 
grace of its wandlike stem is lost entirely; also the greenish-yellow of the flowers as seen 
in mass is disappointing. 

In orchids, lilies and iris, form is the chief element of beauty and should have first 
consideration. Such flowers should never be massed. 

Color is the dominant attraction in pansies, sweet peas, violets, and nasturtiums; 
therefore, the more of these the better. Peonies are difficult to arrange simply and singly 
and are much more splendid when massed. 

In many plants form and color are both so attractive that the plant may be selected 
for either characteristic, but in the decorative arrangement one idea should be dominant. 

The rose is one of the best examples of threefold adaptability. One long-stemmed 
rose in a slender vase, which w^ill keep it in position, is a thing of beauty in line which should 
give joy to a whole household; a group of three at different stages of opening, with their 
leaves, is an example of beauty of form which would furnish a noble decoration; and a 
mass of full-blown roses would present a glory of color which might well be the special 
decorative feature at a wedding, a graduation, or a church service in June. The chrysan- 
themum and the poppy are almost equally adaptable. 

In some cases foliage is the attractive feature, and it possesses the same elements 
of line, form and color. Rushes and grasses are lovely in line. Some varieties of oak are 
so impressive in form that they should be arranged so that the shape of each leaf in the 
spray should be seen. The acanthus and the ivy have furnished inspiration for genera- 
tions of sculptors. The begonias and many varieties of autumn foliage rival flowers in bril- 



INDOOR GARDEN. CUT FLOWERS— DECORATIVE USE 473 

Hancy of color; more often, however, foliage is the background and should be subordinate 
to flowers. In many cases it is necessary to remove some of the leaves so that they do not 
compete with the flowers in interest. Carnations should preferably be arranged with their 
own foliage. Often they come from the florist accompanied by asparagus or sword ferns, 
a combination incongruous in both form and color. Perhaps some day a lover of carnations 
will develop a variety of them profuse in leafage and will grow it to furnish foliage for the 
flowering varieties. 

Nature is very careful about the foliage she uses with flowers, and uses a different 
green with white lilacs from the one she uses with the colored species. At times she sends 
the flowers before the leaves, as in the case of the azaleas and many of the fruit blossoms, 
so that the contrasting character of the erratic stems is not missed. There are always leaves 
when violets and sweet peas and nasturtiums bloom. Fewer blossoms with a little of the 
foliage make a much more attractive arrangement than a mass of blossoms and no leaves. 
Even though buds must be picked with the blossoms in order to secure enough foliage, it 
should be considered no sacrifice since they, too, contribute to the general effect. 

The nature of the plant growth should suggest the manner of arrangement. Branches 
of trees should be arranged so that their strong, rugged character is preserved. Vines 
should appear to run or droop or climb. When grace and delicacy distinguish plants these 
characteristics should not be lost in arrangement. 

Whole plants, such as the primrose, the cyclamen, and many bulbs, such as daffo- 
dils, jonquils, and tulips, furnish a ready-made arrangement difficult to equal. Violets or 
hepaticas, ripple grass or dandelions, carefully selected and sometimes judiciously pruned, 
are charming. One bit of sod from a New England pasture has been known to furnish ten 
varieties of plants, and is a wild garden in itself. Taken early in March and brought into 
the favoring warmth of the house, it is a prophecy of the spring easily read by a family of 
children, who receive thereby a vision of the beauty of a little grass plant not so easily per- 
ceived when the plants come in battalions. 



474 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Sec. X— INDOOR GARDEN, CUT FLOWERS 



CARE OF FLOWERS AND PLANTS 



Insects — With regard to potted plants generally 
one should chase the wooly white mealy bugs and 
little red ants away with a toothpick. Drown the 
red spider with a squirt gun. 

If bugs and spiders shatter your preparedness 
program, cut plants off within an inch of their 
lives and throw them away. They'll grow again. 

The green flies, which are not so green as they 
look, won't bother your plants if you keep them 
well bathed and fed — the plants, not the flies. 

When a fern turns yellow, slice a raw potato 
and put it on top of soil; this will draw out the 
worms, which are generally the cause. 

Ammonia water applications are good for plants 
that do not seem to thrive. Soapy water is also 
good for the soil about plants. 

Ivy — The hardy ground ivy will thrive in almost 
any situation, even in a room not always well 
lighted. Select two or three pieces of ivy, each 
about a yard in length, place the ends in a two- 
quart jar kept filled with water. Twine the plant 
about the pedestal of a statue. 

Rubber Plants need a sun-bath every day. Their 
feet should be kept damp but not wet. The leaves 
should be washed twice a week in good soap suds 
and rinsed in clear water. When the pots get too 
full of roots, repot the plants. Every rubber plant 
should have a prepared food "square meal" twice 
a month. Give it also a dose occasionally of 
diluted ammonia. 

Palms — Add some milk to the water with which 
you wash palms. This causes the leaves to shine, 
and helps their good health. 

Mint will grow in water, as many other plants, 
if left in a sunny window and given plenty of air. 

Lettuce can be kept growing all summer, from 
the early varieties started in boxes in the house 
to endive, the lettuce of autumn, which may be 
sown from June to August. Endive is tender as 
a young plant but bravely withstands the early 
frosts. 

Onion Crates Tabourets — By removing the thin 
slats from the top and bottom of onion crates and 
removing the wire of the corners until the sides 
have been interlaced, then replacing the wires and 
fastening securely, they make excellent fern stands. 
They can be stained or painted any desired color, 
and are really very attractive. 



To Prevent Broken Pots and Flowers — Flower 
pots on piazza railings are easily knocked off, and 
both pot and flower broken. All flower pots have 
holes in the bottom. Nail a small-headed nail about 
three or four inches long on the top of the ban- 
isters, over which slip the pot and all the trouble 
is ended. 

To clean flower pots and trays of brass, rub them 
•with a piece of lemon, pour boiling water over 
them, and finally polish them v^ith a soft dry cloth. 

Tea leaves, moistened with vinegar, remove the 
discoloration in glass caused by flowers. 

To clean deep flower vases, mix a tablespoonful 
of coarse salt and a gill of vinegar. Pour in the 
vase and let it stand for a while. Shake well and 
rinse ^vith clear water. 

Care of Cut Flowers — The principal drawback 
to cut flowers is that they wither quickly. Some 
seem to have more luck than others in keeping 
them fresh. For instance, in the matter of violets, 
it is impossible to wear them several times without 
noticing the overpowering stale odor which pro- 
claims them beyond redemption. 

Keep Wrapped — Of course, many people find 
that they cannot wear cut flowers even for one 
afternoon, because the body heat seems to wilt 
them, but if this can be avoided it is quite possible 
to find a bunch almost as fresh the second day as 
on the first, if properly guarded overnight. 

Keep the box that your violets came in and 
when you take them off hold the stems under 
running water for a few minutes, taking care not 
to wet the violets themselves. Then wrap them 
up in the oiled paper and put them back in the 
covered box outside the window, if it is cool, or 
in the refrigerator; but in either case keep them 
wrapped. 

Preservation — This treatment seems to restore 
the flowers and hold in them the delicious odor 
which so soon becomes rank if they are kept un- 
wrapped in a close room. 

Some find that a pinch of salt in the water will 
keep cut flowers fresh longer; and so it does in 
some cases. In others it seems to change the color 
a little. With roses it is successful, but not so 
much so with violets. A piece of gum camphor 
is said to be an excellent preservative in the water. 
Others advocate a small lump of charcoal. In any 
case, the water should be changed daily and the 
flowers kept in a cool place overnight.

SUGGESTIONS FOR UTILIZING 
LIMITED AREAS 

(Farmers' Bulletin No. 818, U. S. Departmenf 
of Agriculture, in Its Entirety 
"The Small Vegetable Garden") 

O ESSENTIALS OF GARDENING 

The primary needs for successful vegetable gardening on a small scale are 
the same as those for gardening on a large scale. On limited plots, however, 
greater emphasis must be placed on intensive culture and carefully arranged rota- 
tions so that every available foot of space may be made to produce the maximum 
yield. 

The essentials of all gardening are soil of suitable texture containing avail- 
able plant food, water to dissolve the plant food so that the plant rootlets may 
make use of it, seeds or plants which v^ill produce the desired crops, sunshine and 
warmth to bring about germination and plant development, and cultivation. Much 
also depends upon the gardener and the care he bestows on his enterprise. 

Other factors — location and exposure — cannot always receive much consid- 
eration in gardening small plots since there is ordinarily little room for choice. 
Such spaces are located usually in yards, or the choice of location is restricted in 
other ways by the necessity that the spaces be accessible to dwellings. When a 
possibility for the exercise of choice does exist, however, several considerations 
should be kept in mind by the gardener. It should be recognized that frost is less 
likely to injure vegetables planted on high ground than those planted in low^ places 
or valleys into w^hich the heavier cold air commonly settles ; that crops w^ill mature 
more rapidly on land that has a sunny, southern exposure than on other plots; that 
the garden should be fairly level, but well drained; and that a warm, sandy loam 
w^ill produce an earlier crop than a heavier soil that retains more water and less 
heat. 

The soil is the storehouse of plant food and should, therefore, have a 
relatively open texture so that the rootlets of vegetables may extend themselves 
readily in their search for sustenance. A high proportion of humus or rotted vege- 
table material is desirable in the soil, since it produces an open texture, adds nitrogen, 

477 



478 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Section XI— KITCHEN GARDEN 

insures the presence of beneficial bacteria, aids in unlocking plant food from mineral 
particles, and increases the moisture-retaining properties of the soil. 

About 50 per cent, of ordinary earth is not soil at all, but consists of air 
and water. Water makes the soluble plant food that is present in the soil freely 
available, while the air in the soil makes possible bacterial development and facili- 
tates chemical action, which makes additional plant food available. 

IMPORTANCE OF A GOOD SEED BED 

The cultivation of crops is important because the stirring and loosening of the soil 
directly conserves moisture to some extent, kills weeds, which draw moisture and plant food 
at the expense of the crops, and incorporates air into the soil. 

Too much emphasis cannot be laid on the preparation of a good seed bed. A seed 
bed of fine tilth — made such by deep plowing, careful harrowing, and fining of the soil — 
is the foundation of good gardening. It is essential for the proper germination of seeds and 
growth of young plants. The soil must be friable and free from clods. A clod locks up 
plant food and prevents its utilization by the plant. Good soil and fine tilth furnish best 
conditions for root development. Upon the fine, hairy, fibrous, feeding roots, which are 
possible only in well-tilled soil, the plant depends for its stockiness and growth. 

The careful gardener will regard his whole garden as a seed bed and will cultivate 
and fertilize it accordingly. 

FERTILIZERS 

Fertilizers, the plant foods for the garden, should be carefully selected. Nitrogen, 
which stimulates leaf growth, id best supplied by turning under rich, well-rotted or com- 
posted manure or rotting vegetable matter. Sheep manure and poultry droppings will hurry 
plants along more rapidly than most chemical fertilizers. These substances, as well as bone 
meal, also a valuable fertilizer, usually may be obtained from seed stores. 

PLANNING THE SMALL GARDEN 

With a little forethought a comparatively small tract of land may be made to supply 
the average family with fresh vegetables throughout the growing season. Most owners of 
small gardens are content to raise a single crop on each plot of land at their disposal. It 
is quite possible, however, to grow two or three crops of some vegetables in one season, 
and if these are properly selected the home-grow^n produce should be both better and 
cheaper than any that can be purchased on the market. 

Just w^hat vegetables are to be grown depends, of course, upon the individual tastes 
of the family. In general, the aim of the home gardener should be to raise vegetables in 
which freshness is an important quality. Peas, string beans, Lima beans, asparagus, and 
sweet corn, for example, lose much if they are not cooked almost immediately after they 
are picked. On the other hand, as good potatoes usually can be bought as can be grown. 
Moreover, potatoes occupy a large area in proportion to their yield and consume in a back 
yard or small garden valuable space which, in most cases, could be put to much more profit- 
able use. This may be true also, in some cases, of corn, cucumbers, squashes, and melons. 

It will pay the home gardener to grow certain specialties of which he may be fond, 
and which may be troublesome or expensive to purchase. Okra is an example of this cIeiss, 
and little beds of parsley, chives, or other herbs take up very little room and provide the 
housewife with additions for her table, which are most welcome if they can be picked at the 
right moment without trouble.

tinuously. This can be accomplished only by careful planning, and it is recommended, 
therefore, that a complete lay-out for the garden be drawn up in advance. On the plan 
the gardener may indicate the approximate date when each of his projected crops is to be 
planted. No more space should be allotted to each than is needed to furnish a sufficient 
quantity of the vegetable for family consumption or for other known needs. In many 
cases, also, space should be left between the rows for the interplanting of later crops and for 
easy cultivation. Plants which make a high growth and cause heavy shade should not be 
located where they will interfere with sun-loving small plants. It is well also to separate 
perennials, such as rhubarb and asparagus, which are not cultivated, from plants which must 
be tilled. 

THE DIAGRAM AS A RECORD 

If a garden is planned in this way and the scheme carried out, the plan should be 
kept for use the following year, with notes of the success or failure of the different items 
in it. For example, if too much or too little of any vegetable was grown, this fact should 
be recorded. It is not desirable, however, to follow too closely the same plan in succeed- 
ing years. The same kind of vegetables should not be grown twice, if this can be avoided, 
in the same part of the garden. The danger of attack by diseases and insects is heightened 
when vegetables of the same kind follow each othe.- repeatedly in a given space, such as 
a row or bed. If a radically different kind of plant is grown in a space, on the other hand, 
disease spores and insects, though present in the soil, probably will not attack the second 
crop. 

In making a diagram of the garden it is well to use a tough paper, such as heavy 
wrapping paper, which will stand repeated handling and use out of doors. A fairly large 
scale should be adopted, so that full notes can be kept in the spaces representing rows. 
If the garden is fairly large or abnormally long, the diagram may be made in separate 
sections for the sake of convenience.

A BACK YARD GARDEN 

The garden shown in the diagram (fig. 1 ) was a city back yard, 25 by 70 feet in 
dimensions, near New York City. It happened to be bounded on two sides by a board 
fence, and advantage was taken of this fact to plant and train grape vines. Stawberry 
plants were set alongside the flagstone walks and currant bushes between the walks and 
the fence. In the space between the bushes and the strawberries low-growing vegetables, 
such as bush beans, peppers, eggplants, and the like were set out. In a space about 1 2 feet 



480 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Section XI— KITCHEN GARDEN 

wide between the walks low-growing, quick-maturing varieties of early vegetables were 
planted in such a way that later-maturing varieties could be put out at proper intervals 
between them. The early plantings consisted of radishes, early beets, lettuce, carrots, and 
a few parsnips. The beets gave way later to a few late cabbage plants. The sunniest por- 
tion of the yard was turned over to tomatoes, of which there were about a dozen plants 
trained to a single stem and set about 1 8 inches apart in each direction. Early and late 
peas were put out in the least sunny portions of the yard. Later, in the fall, spinach, kale, 
and potato-onion sets were planted in order to provide a supply of green succulents for the 
winter and early spring. 

IMPORTANCE OF SUNUGHT 

In making the garden plan the gardener should recognize that no amount of fer- 
tilizer, watering, and cultivation will make up for the absence of sunlight in a garden. 
Careful consideration should be given to how many hours a day any part of the yard is 
in shadow from buildings, fences, or trees. If a successful garden is to be maintained, the 
greater portion of the plot must have at least five hours of sunlight a day. As a rule, 
foliage crops, such as lettuce, spinach, and kale, do fairly well in partial shade, but even 
these need sunshine two or three hours a day. Plants which must ripen fruits, such as 
tomatoes and eggplant, should have the sunniest locations. 

CHOOSING CROPS 

Vegetable seed should be ordered in advance of the time for planting in the open, 
so that they will be on hand for planting in flats or frames, and also for use outdoors, as 
soon as the weather and the condition of the soil make planting possible. Before ordering 
seed it is a good idea to look over the garden plot, decide on the best location for each 
vegetable, and determine how much seed will be required for the space available for each 
variety. The garden plan may then be drawn. 

SEED FOR A FAMILY OF FOUR 

The following are the approximate quantities of seed that should be purchased for 
a garden which is to supply vegetables for successive plantings throughout the season for a 
family of four: 

Beans, snap I pint Parsnips Yl ounce 

Beans, pole Lima Yz pint Salsify 1 ounce 

Beans, bush Lima Yl pi"' Squash, summer Yl ounce 

Cabbage, early Yl ounce Squash, Hubbard type Yl ounce 

Carrot I ounce Cauliflower 1 packet 

Celery I ounce Eggplant 1 packet 

Cucumber Yl ounce Parsley 1 packet 

Kale, or Swiss chard Yl ounce 

For most of the vegetables listed the planting may consist of the entire quantities 
mentioned. Relatively small quantities of cauliflower, eggplant and parsley will be sufficient 
for most families, however. 

The following vegetables undoubtedly will be planted in larger amounts than those 
just mentioned, and the amounts of seed given will be a guide for ordinary requirements. 
Some families may need more of the various vegetables and others less: 

Beet 2 ounces Radish I ounce 

Cabbage, late Yl ounce Spinach !4 p o u n d i n 

Corn, sweet 1 pint «P"ng and '/^ 

Lettuce Yl ounce Pound m fall 

Muskmelon 1 ounce Tomatoes, late 14 ounce 

Onion sets 2 quarts Turnips ' ounce 

Peas, garden 2 to 4 quarts 



KITCHEN GARDEN— ESSENTIALS AND PLANNING 481 

The entire supply of seeds of string bean, bush Lima bean, sweet corn, lettuce, 
peas, and radish should not be planted at one time, but successive plantings two to three 
weeks apart should be made so that a fresh supply of the vegetables may be had throughout 
the season. 

Of early Irish potatoes one peck to half bushel will be required, and of late potatoes 
half bushel to 1 bushel, or more, depending upon the amount of ground available for this 
purpose. If abundant space is available, it may be well to grow enough Irish potatoes to 
last throughout the winter. 

If the family wishes to raise vegetables to supply current needs and also to supply 
a surplus for canning, the amounts indicated above should be increased considerably.* 



AIDS TO EARUNESS 

The hotbed, the "flat" or seed box, and the cold frame are the gardener's greatest 
aids in raising early crops. The hotbed and the flat enable him to plant seed and produce 
seedlings long before most of the seeds may be planted out of doors and before those 
which have been planted in the plot have begun to germinate. The cold frame enables 
him to get the seedlings produced in the hotbed gradually accustomed to outdoor condi- 
tions and to raise these into strong, sturdy planting stock by the time the garden is ready for 
them. Resetting from a hotbed into a cold frame, or from one flat into another, or into pots, 
gives most plants a better root system and makes them stockier and more valuable for trans- 
planting into the open ground. Besides being used in hardening plants that have been 
started in the hotbed, the cold frame is utilized in mild climates instead of a hotbed for 
starting plants before seeds can be planted safely in the open. In the extreme South the 
cold frame is much more extensively used than the hotbed, but each has its place in garden 
economy. 

Still another method of giving plants an early start is used extensively for beans, 
cucumbers, melons, sweet corn, and other warmth-loving plants. This consists in planting 
enough seeds for a "hill" in berry boxes filled with soil. The boxes are kept in the house 
or in greenhouses until the garden soil becomes warm, by which time the plants should have 
reached a considerable degree of development. The bottoms of the boxes are then cut 
away and the remaining frame is sunk with the plants in their permanent location in the 
garden. 

STARTING EARLY VEGETABLES IN THE HOUSE 

The flat or seed box, which is kept in the house, is perhaps the most practical 
device for use by the home gardener for starting early vegetables. By its use earlier crops 
of tomatoes, cabbage, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, peppers, eggplant, and lettuce can be 
had with little outlay for equipment. Early potatoes sometimes are forced in the same way. 
Seeds so planted germinate and are ready for transplanting by the time it is safe to sow 
the same kind of seed in the open ground. When danger of frost is over and the soil is 
dry enough to work, therefore, the early garden may be started with seedlings well above 
the surface. Transplanting, if properly done, instead of injuring seems to help such plants 
to develop a strong root system. 



•The home gardener should find useful Farmers' Bulletins 359, Canning Vegetables in the Home; 
521, Canning Tomatoes, Home and Club Work; 255, Home Vegetable Garden; and 647, Home Garden 
in the South. The latter is designed particularly for use in the warmer climates, but contains many sug- 
gestions that can be adapted readily by home gardeners in the North. The Department of Agriculture 
will supply these bulletins free on application as long as its stock for free distribution lasts. 



482 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Section XI— KITCHEN GARDEN 

HOW TO MAKE AND USE A SEED BOX 

Any sort of wooden box filled with good soil answers the purpose, but the follow- 
ing specific suggestions for a box of convenient size may be useful. Construct a box 3 to 
4 inches deep, 12 to 14 inches wide, and 20 to 24 inches long. A layer of about 1 inch 
of gravel or cinders should be placed in the bottom of the box. It should then be filled 
nearly full with rich garden soil or soil enriched with decayed leaves or manure. Tlie rich 
soil beneath the family woodpile or around decaying logs is splendid for this purpose. The 
soil should be pressed down firmly with a small piece of board and rows made one-fourth 
to one-half inch deep and 2 inches apart crosswise of the box. The seeds should be dis- 
tributed 8 or I to the inch in the row^s and be covered. The soil should be watered and 
the box set in a warm place in the light. The best location is just inside a sunny window. 
Water enough must be given from time to time to cause the seeds to germinate and grow 
thriftily, but not enough to leak through the box. If a piece of glass is used to cover the 
box, it will hold the moisture in the soil and hasten the germination of the seeds. 

When the plants are from an inch to an inch and a half high they should be 
thinned to 1 or 2 inches apart in the row, so as to give them space enough to make a 
strong, stocky growth. If it is desired to keep the plants which are thinned out, they may 
be set 2 inches apart each way in boxes similar to the seed box. When the weather 
becomes mild the box of plants should be set out of doors part of the time so that the 
plants will "harden off" in preparation for transplanting to the garden later. A good water- 
ing should be given just before the plants are taken out of the box for transplanting, so 
that a large ball of earth will stick to the roots of each one. 

THE HOTBED 

Locate the hotbed in some sheltered but not shaded spot which has a southern 
exposure. The most convenient size is a box-like structure 6 feet wide and any multiple 
of 3 feet long, so that standard 3 by 6 foot hotbed sash may be used. The frame should 
be 12 inches high in the back and 8 inches in the front. This slope is for the purpose of 
securing a better angle for the sun's rays and should be faced toward the south. 

The hotbed not only must collect any heat it can from the sun, but also must gen- 
erate heat of its own from fermentation in fresh manure. Fresh horse manure, free from 
stable litter, is best for generating heat. 

If the hotbed is to be an annual affair, make an excavation 1 8 inches to 2 feet 
deep, about 2 feet greater in length and width than the frame carrying the sash. Line the 
excavation with plank or with a brick or concrete wall. A drain to carry off surplus water 
is essential. This may consist of either tile or pipe extending to a low portion of the garden 
or a trench partially filled with coarse stones covered with a layer of hay or sod and then 
filled level with soil. 

After a sufficient amount of fresh horse manure has been accumulated fill the hot- 
bed pit, and while it is being filled tramp the manure as firmly and as evenly as possible. 
When the ground level is reached, place the frame in position and bank the sides and ends 
with manure. Place about 3 inches of good garden loam on top of the manure inside the 
frame and cover it with the sash. After the heat has reached its maximum and has sub- 
sided to between 80 and 90 degrees F., it will be safe to plant the seeds. Select the 
plumpest, freshest seeds obtainable. Use standard varieties, and get them from reliable seed 
houses. 

Keep the bed partially dark until the seeds germinate. 

After germination, however, the plants will need all the light possible, exclusive of 
the direct rays of the sun, to keep them growing rapidly. This is a crisis in plant life, and 



KITCHEN GARDEN— ESSENTIALS AND PLANNING 483 

ventilating and watering with great care are of prime importance. Too close planting and 
too much heat and water cause the plants to become spindling. Water the plants on clear 
days, in the morning, and ventilate immediately to dry the foliage and to prevent mildew. 

THE COLD FRAME 

The cold frame, so useful in hardening plants started in the hotbed and for start- 
ing plants in mild climates, is constructed in much the same way as the hotbed, except 
that no manure is used, and the frame may be covered either with glass sash or with ceuivas. 
A cold frame may be built on the surface of the ground, but a more permanent structure, 
suitable for holding plants over winter, will require a pit 18 to 24 inches deep. The cold 
frame should be filled with a good potting soil. The plants should have more ventilation 
in the cold frame, but should not receive so much water. It is best to keep the soil rather dry. 

In transplanting, remember that plants usually thrive better if transplanted into 
ground that has been freshly cultivated. Transplanting to the open field is best done in 
cool, cloudy weather and in the afternoon. This prevents the sun's rays from causing the 
plant to lose too much moisture through evaporation. In transplanting the gardener will find 
a child's express wagon an excellent trolley tray for bedding out his seedlings. 

TOOLS 

The necessary tools for preparing and caring for the small garden are few. A 
spade or garden fork for digging, a hoe, a steel-tooth rake, a trowel, and a dibble or 
pointed stick complete the list of essentials. The gardener will find it convenient, however, 
to possess some additional implements. If tree roots underlie any portion of the garden 
plot and must be cut away, a hatchet, ax, or mattock will be a real necessity. If the soil 
of the plot has become compacted, as where walks have existed, a pick may be needed 
for digging. Perhaps in such cases it will be most economical to fill both cutting Eind 
digging needs by purchasing a pick-ax which has a pick point at one end of the head and a 
cutting blade at the other. Apparatus for watering plants also should be included. This 
may be a watering pot of generous proportions or, where running water is available, a hose. 
In order that rows may be made straight and uniform a substantial line or cord should be 
provided. 

A most convenient implement for use in the home garden, especially where the 
plot is fairly large, is a hand cultivator or wheel hoe. This implement is a miniature cul- 
tivator or plow, w^ith adjustable blades, mounted on a wheel or wheels, and is pushed along 
by hand. Attachments make possible either the turning of small furrows, the stirring of the 
soil, or the removal of weeds. Much time and labor may be saved by such a device. 

Among the other implements which may be useful in the home garden but which 
are not essential are planting and cultivating hoes of special shapes, a combination hoe and 
rake, a wheelbarrow, a shovel, hand weeding tools, and other small implements for special 
uses. 

PREPARING THE SOIL 

A simple test to determine when garden soil is ready for plowing or working is to 
take a handful of earth from the surface and close the fingers tightly on it. If the earth 
compacted in this way is dry enough for cultivation, it will fall apart when the hand is 
opened. This test is applicable only to comparatively heavy soils, but it is these which 
receive the most injury if they are worked when wet. On such soils overzealous gardeners 
not only waste their time but frequently do actual damage by attempting to work them too 
early. 



484 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Section XI— KITCHEN GARDEN 

BREAKING 

The kind of preparation that must be given to the small garden and the amount 
of work that will be required will depend largely, of course, on the condition of the plot 
and the use to which it has been put. If the ground selected for the garden has been 
firmed by much tramping, as is often the case in back yards, it cannot be got into proper 
condition without the expenditure of considerable labor. When plowing with a team can 
be practiced, that is the best method for giving the ground its initial breaking. The surface, 
of course, should be harrowed a ssoon as possible after plowing. 

If the plot cannot be plowed, the gardener must resort to the use of a garden fork 
or spade, or in the case of very hard spots, a mattock. The soil should be well loosened 
to the depth of the spade or fork. If heavy clay is encountered at this depth, it should 
not be turned up to the surface, but the slices of soil should be kept in their normal posi- 
tion. As soon as each spade or fork full of earth is loosened, it should be broken up by 
blows with the back of the implement. Later the freshly dug surface should be fined and 
smoothed with a steel-tooth rake. It is not sufficient that the surface be made fine; the soil 
should be well pulverized to the depth of the digging. Any sod or plant growth on the 
garden plot should be turned under to rot and form humus. In turning under sod with a 
spade or fork it is well to reverse each segment so that foliage will be down and roots up. 

The first digging of a plot of ground which has not before been cultivated is likely 
to be a laborious task, and may even take away the enthusiasm of the would-be gardener. 
After this portion of the work is done, however, the fining of the soil, planting, and culti- 
vation are not arduous. It may be well in many cases for the gardener to employ some one 
to break his ground, whether this be done with plow, spade, or fork. 

IMPROVING SOIL TEXTURE 

It is desirable that the soil of the garden be as open and light as possible. Where 
a natural loam exists in the plot good texture can be given by digging and cultivating. 
Where the soil is heavy, containing much clay, however, other steps are necessary. If clean 
sand is available this may be mixed with the soil. Well-sifted coal ashes which, unlike 
wood ashes, have no fertilizing value, are useful in lightening the soil. Care should be 
taken that no coarse cinders or pieces of partly burned coal are added to the soil with the 
ashes. 

Lime added to the soil also will tend to lighten it and will, at the same time, 
correct acidity. A thin coat of air-slaked lime should be spread on the ground and worked 
in well. Lime is not a plant food, but its function in gardening is important none the 
less. By correcting acidity it makes possible the development of countless soil bacteria 
which aid in unlocking plant food from the mineral particles of the soil and in making these 
substances available for the plants. In acid soils these helpful organisms do not thrive, and 
in their absence vegetables do not grow at their best. 

FERTILIZERS 

After the soil has been got into good mechanical condition, it usually is desirable 
to apply some form of fertilizer. Barnyard or stable manure, which furnishes both plant 
food and humus, undoubtedly is the best, and applications of from 20 to 30 tons to the 
acre are satisfactory. This is roughly equivalent to from 400 to 600 pounds, or several 
wheelbarrow loads, for each plot 20 by 20 feet. The manure should be distributed evenly 
over the surface, and later worked in with a hoe and rake. 

Frequently it is advisable also to apply commercial fertilizer. An application of 
1,000 to 1,500 pounds to the acre, or 10 to 15 pounds per plot 20 feet square, usually 



KITCHEN GARDEN— ESSENTIALS AND PLANNING 485 



is sufficient. In order to supply potash, if this is needed, unleached wood ashes may 
be distributed over the garden at the rate of LOGO pounds to the acre, or 10 pounds 
to each plot 20 feet square. Wet or leached ashes have less fertilizer value. Dou- 
ble the quantity of these should be used. In order to start the plants in the 
spring, applications of 100 pounds to the acre of nitrate of soda, of 1 pound to 
each 20-foot square, may be used. By far the best way to use nitrate of soda in the small 
garden, however, is to dissolve a teaspoonful of the chemical in a gallon of water and 
use the solution for watering young plants. It is important to remember that no form of 
commercial fertilizer will yield good results unless the soil is well supplied with humus. 
Reference already has been made to the use of prepared sheep manure as a ferti- 
lizer. When this plant food can be obtained at a reasonable price, it is perhaps the safest 
concentrated fertilizer for use by the home gardener. It will not pay to broadcast prepared 
sheep manure. Small quantities should be applied under the drill when the seeds are planted 
or the plants set out. Later applications may be worked in with a trowel around the plants. 

PLANTING VEGETABLES IN THE OPEN 
WHEN TO PLANT 

Vegetables may be divided into two classes — "cold temperature" and "warm tem- 
perature" vegetables. When peach and plum trees are in blossom, or, where these trees do 
not occur, when silver maples put forth leaves, or catkins appear on willows and poplars, 
it is time to sow in the open ground the seeds of lettuce, spinach, kale, endive, radish, pars- 
ley, beets, turnips, cabbage, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, carrots, round-seeded peas, and 
onions. The wrinkled peas should not be planted until later, as they are more likely to 
rot in cool ground than are the smooth varieties. When the apple trees bloom, or when 
the dogwood and white oak buds unfold, it is time to plant the heat-loving vegetables, such 
as cucumbers, beans, sweet corn, okra, pumpkin, and squash. This is an old approximation 
for planting dates, but has been found in most cases to be satisfactory. 

Planting times may be fixed in still another way on the basis of the occurrence of 
frost. Frost ordinarily will kill tender growths of vegetables, but young plants of a few 
kinds will survive light frosts. Among the latter, which may be called Group I. are cabbage, 
lettuce, Irish potatoes, early peas (smooth seeded), onion seeds and sets, parsnips, salsify, 
beets, radishes, and such salad plants as kale, spinach, and mustard. 

A "second early" group of vegetables, which may be called Group II, may be planted 
as soon as danger of frost is over. In this group are included lettuce plants and seeds, 
radishes, wrinkled peas, carrots, and early sweet corn. 

A week or 1 days after the seeds and plants of Group II are placed in the ground, 
string beans and late sweet corn, constituting Group III, may be planted. 

A group of plants, which may be called Group IV, should be planted only after the 
ground has begun to warm up. In this group are cucumbers, melons, squashes, pumpkins, 
Lima beans, and tomato, eggplant, and pepper plants. 

Detailed suggestions for planting are given in a table hereafter. 

DEPTHS OF PLANTING 

No general rule can be given with regard to the depth for planting seeds, since 
different varieties of vegetables and different soils necessitate different practices. The 
smaller the seeds, usually, the shallower the planting should be. In heavy clay or moist soils 
the covering should be lighter than in sandy or dry soils.

488 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Section XI— KITCHEN GARDEN 

SEED BEDS 

The gardener may find it desirable to reserve a small area of his garden for a seed 
bed in which some of the second crops for his rotations may be grown while the ground in 
which they are to develop is still occupied. In this way also adveintage is taken of the fact 
that transplanting makes for stockiness. In seed-bed culture much the same practices are in 
force as in growing plantlets in the flats and frames. The rows of seeds, however, are not 
spaced so closely in the outdoor seed beds as in the boxes and frames. When the plantlets 
crowd they may be thinned out or transplanted to another part of the seed bed . Late cabbage, 
lettuce, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, etc., are plants that in many cases may be treated con- 
veniently in this way. 

PLANTING PRACTICES 

In planting many kinds of seeds in the garden thick sowings are made to insure a 
good stand, and the superfluous plants later are pulled up. Straight rows or drills should 
be used in all cases. The use of a line will make accuracy possible. The line is stretched 
between stakes at the ends of the row, and with this as a guide the furrow is then opened. 
This may be done with the end of a hoe or rake handle, with the comer of a hoe, or the 
point of a special furrow hoe, with a hand plow, or with the edge of a board pressed into 
the loosened soil. Small seeds may be shaken out of the packet by hand in a thin stream 
while the packet is held close to the bottom of the furrow. Larger seeds, like peas and 
beans, may be dropped from the hand. Mechanical planters, built like wheel hoes, may 
be purchased if the size of the garden justifies their use. 

DRILLS, ROWS, AND HILLS 

Small plants which are to be left almost touching each other, as is the case with 
onions and carrots, are said to be grown in drills. Plants grown at fixed distances, as cab- 
bages or potatoes, are in rows. When plants are grown at distances of several feet apart 
in both directions they are said to be in hills. Furrows are opened for planting in both drUls 
and rows. Hills, however, may be opened with a spade or trowel. An excellent method 
of using fertilizer is to apply it in the drills, rows, or hills before planting. In such cases 
the fertilizer should be mixed carefully with the soil in the bottom of the opening before 
the seeds are deposited. 

FINAL PLANTING TOUCHES 

In planting the gardener should keep in mind that to germinate and develop prop- 
erly into sturdy plants the seed must be firmly imbedded in well-fined, moist soil. The 
condition of the soil beneath the seeds is most important, since it is in this soil that the 
rootlets on emerging must find sustenance. Air spaces or cracks may cause the rootlets 
to shrivel. It is well, therefore, especially if the soil is at all dry, to force the seeds gently 
into the soil, compacting it slightly. This may be done with the back of a hoe in the case 
of small seeds, or with the ball of the foot when large seeds, such as beans and peas, are 
being planted. The seeds should then be covered immediately with soil. This should be 
very slightly compacted over the seeds with the back of the hoe. If weather conditions are 
such that there is a tendency for the soil to bake over the drills and rows before the plants 
appear, it is well to rake very lightly with aii steel-tooth rake. It may be necessary, also, to 
work the ground at the sides of the rows as the plants are breaking through the surface. 
This should be done very carefully to avoid injury to the tender shoots. 

SETTING OUT PLANTS 

Plants grown in flats, hotbeds, or cold frames should be "hardened off," as has 
already been suggested, before they are to be planted out of doors. Another preliminary 
step, if the plants are too tall or succulent, is to trim away about one-half of the large 



KITCHEN GARDEN— CULTIVATION 489 



leaves. Several hours before transplanting the plants should be watered thoroughly, so 
that the soil will be moist enough to stick to the roots in balls of considerable bulk. After 
staking out rows and marking planting positions, lift the plants out with a trowel, keeping 
as much soil as possible on the roots. Cut or tear the plants apart when their roots are 
intertwined. 

If the ground is moist, merely open a hole with a trowel or dibble, insert the earth- 
incased roots of a plant, draw soil up to the stalk and firm with knuckles and the balls of 
thumbs. If the soil is at all dry, pour about a pint of water into each hole before the 
plant is set. The surface about each plant should be raked carefully when all the plants 
are set. 

CULTIVATION 

The importance of cultivation has been referred to in the discussion of the prepara- 
tion of the seed bed. It is, however, after the seeds have sprouted or after the plants have 
been set in their permanent locations that cultivation becomes of major importance. The 
gardener should never permit the surface of the soil to become baked or even to form an 
appreciable crust. Constant stirring with heind tools or a wheel cultivator should be prac- 
ticed between the rows and about the plants. Such a stirring permits the air to penetrate 
the soil, where it facilitates chemical action EUid bacterial activity, destroys weeds which 
otherwise would utilize large amounts of plant food, and, finally, conserves the moisture 
supply. The rake is perhaps the gardener's most valuable tool in cultivating. This can 
be passed backward and forward over the ground until it is in an open, mellow condition. 
Where vegetables grow closely in the rows it often will be necessary to supplement the 
cultivation by hand weeding. Small implements are made for this purpose, and may be 
purchased cheaply. It is well also in some cases to pull up weeds by hand, especially where 
they grow closely about the stalks of the garden plants. 

STIRRING THE SOIL AFTER RAINS 

Just as the gardener should be careful in early spring not to dig the ground when 
the soil is too moist, so he should be careful later in the season not to cultivate too soon 
after rains. The stirring of very muddy soil "puddles" it into a compact, cement-like 
mass in which the plant food is securely locked. The garden will require attention, however, 
as soon as the excess moisture from a rain has soaked in or partially evaporated. Unless 
the g^round is stirred at this time a crust will' form almost inevitably. Such a crust, besides 
restricting the plants, prevents the access of air, and also facilitates the loss of moisture 
through evaporation. - - , 

IRRIGATION 

When, during prolonged dry spells, the plants give evidence of suffering because of 
the lack of moisture, water must, if possible, be supplied artificially. Where a supply of 
piped water is at hand, perhaps the most usual method of irrigation is by sprinkling with 
a hose. If sprinkling is practiced, it should be done late in the afternoon. It is not sufficient 
merely to dampen the surface; a thorough wetting should be given. A more satisfactory 
and more economical method of irrigation, however, is to open small furrows between the 
rows of growing plants and to supply water in these ditches from a hose or pipe. Several 
hours after the water has soaked in, the dry earth should be drawn back into place. 

PROTECTING PLANTS FROM DISEASES AND PESTS 

Unfortunately, the gardener is not assured of success when his plants have started 
to grow thriftily. He must count almost inevitably upon the presence in his garden of 
plant diseases and pests, which, if not combated, will interfere seriously with his yields or 
even destroy his plants. It is hard for some gardeners to realize the importance of making 



490 



THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Section XI— KITCHEN GARDEN 



early provision to combat these enemies of plant life. It cannot be too strongly emphasized, 
however, that such provision is of equal importance with other phases of gardening and 
that it should under no circumstances be neglected. The wise gardener does not wait for 
the appearance of insects and diseases, but tEikes steps to combat them by spraying the plemts 
at reasonable intervals from early spring until his crops have been harvested, or by other 
protective measures. He thus insures himself against the likelihood of loss. 

The necessary implements and materials for protecting the home garden against 
insects and diseases should be assembled early in the season. These consist of a substantial 
hand sprayer and the necessary concentrated solutions, which, after dilution with water, are 
to be sprayed on the plants. 

The diseases which affect gcurden plants may be divided into two groups, parasitic 
and constitutional diseases. The parasitic maladies, such as the blights, are caused by fungi 
or germs, and usually may be prevented or controlled by spraying with Bordeaux mixture. 
Little is known, however, of the so-called constitutional diseases, and little can be done to 
prevent their ravages. If some malady which does not yield to treatment with Bordeaux 
m.ixture manifests itself on isolated plants in the garden, it may be well to pull up these 
plants and burn them. 

The insects which attack garden plants may be divided into tw^o groups — those which 
eat or chew the fruit or foliage, and those which suck the plant juices. Eating insects may 
be killed usually by sprajnng poisonous solutions or dusting powders on the plants which 
they attack. Arsenate of lead is the poison in most general use for this purpose. This sub- 
stance is poisonous to persons as well as to insects and must be used with care. It should 
not be applied to vegetables that are to be used soon. All vegetables should be washed 
carefully before they are eaten, regardless of wether they have been sprayed. 

Most of the garden plants may be guarded against disease and at the same time 
protected from attack by eating insects by spraying at intervals of two weeks with a com- 
bination of Bordeaux mixture and arsenate of lead. 

Other methods of protecting plants from the larger eating insects are to pick the 
pests by hand or knock them with a stick into a pan containing water on which a thin film 
of kerosene is floating. Insects collected by hand should be destroyed promptly. Young 
plants may be protected by setting over them wooden frames covered with mosquito net- 
ting, wire mesh, or cheesecloth. Cutworms may be kept from plants by setting tin or paper 
collars into the ground around the stalks. 

Sucking insects, such as plant lice, cannot be killed by poisoning the surface of 
the leaves and fruit, since they feed by puncturing the plants and extracting the internal 
juices. Poisons which will kill by contact or substances which envelop and smother the 
pests are, therefore, employed against the sucking insects. The principal remedies of this 
sort are nicotine solutions, fish-oil and other soap solutions, and kerosene emulsion.

of insects with some account of food plants and ravages should accompany correspondence.

hoppers and Their Control on Sugar Beets and Truck Crops." 



KITCHEN GARDEN— PLANTING AND ROTATIONS 491 

The preceding table lists the insects most likely to appear in the vegetable garden 
and furnishes information in regard to planU attacked and the treatment recommended. 

Transplanting should be done if possible in cloudy weather or late in the afternoon, 
if the weather is especially bright it may be necessary for a day or two to shade the plants 
with newspapers/ folded in inverted V shape and held in place with stones, earth, or other 
material. 

The quickest crop to mature is the radish. Lettuce, turnips, peas, beets, and beans 
usually require 6 to 9 weeks to mature; cabbage, potatoes, early peas, onion sets, and salad 
greens, 1 to 12 weeks; corn from 11 to 1 3 weeks, and potatoes from 15 to 16 weeks. 

SUCCESSIONS AND ROTATIONS 

Since a number of vegetables reach maturity early in the season, it is possible to 
utilize the space they occupied for successive plantings of the same vegetables or for rota- 
tion plantings of different plants. The earliest of all the vegetables to mature is the radish. 
The gardener generally can count on being able to utilize anew the space occupied by the 
first planting of these vegetables in from 5 to 7 weeks, depending on the rapidity with 
which they are consumed. In intensive gardening, however, it is not necessary to wait 
until all the radishes of the first planting have been removed before other plantings can be 
made. Enough of the roots can be removed at intervals to make places for setting lettuce, 
cabbage, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, or other plants, and the two crops — radishes and the 
interplanted crop — can continue growing side by side until the former is used. In a similar 
way, onion sets may be set out in rows that are to be occupied later by tomato plants, room 
being made for the latter by the removal of a few onions when the proper planting time for 
tomatoes arrives. Various combinations of this sort can be worked out between quick- 
maturing crops and the plants grown in frames or seed beds for later planting in the open. 

The gardener should not plant all of his radish, lettuce, or spinach seed at once, 
but should make several successive plantings at intervals of about two weeks. In this way 
the season for these vegetables will be lengthened greatly. Successive planting is possible 
also with beets, peas, beans, sweet com, and a number of other vegetables. The best of 
the successive crops of the quick-maturing vegetables must be crowded into the early part 
of the season, since most such plants do not thrive well when planted in hot weather. This 
is especially true of radishes and lettuce. In thhe case of lettuce this disadvantage can be 
overcome to a certain extent by artificial shading. 

In all sections but the extreme north it usually is possible to grow fall crops of cer- 
tain vegetables, notably carrots, beans, radishes, Irish potatoes, and turnips. In the southern 
part of the country an even larger number of vegetables may be grown in the fall. The 
seeds for these late crops are planted from July to September, depending on whether the 
garden is in the northern or southern States. 

In planting rotations of crops, whether the rotations be during the same or in suc- 
ceeding seasons, certain general principles should be kept in mind. In type and character 
of growth the succeeding plant should differ as ■widely as possible from the plant which it 
follo^vs. This is both for the purpose of avoiding attacks by insects and diseases, and to 
insure that the second crop shall be properly nourished. A good plan is not to have root 
plants, such as beets and carrots, nor plants of the same family, such as cabbage and Brus- 
sels sprouts, or tomatoes and peppers, follow each other. It is well to divide the plants 
into root crops, fruiting crops, and foliage crops, and have members of the different groups 
alternate. 



492 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Section XI— KITCHEN GARDEN 

For the convenience of geirdeners who wish to plan to use their soil to best adveui- 
tage by means of successive plantings and rotations, the following groupings of vegetables 
are made: 

1. Crop* Occupying the Ground All Season — ^Asparagus, rhubarb, beans (pole snap), beans (pole 
Lima), beets (late), carrots (late), parsnips, salsify, corn (late), cucumbers, melons, squash, pumpkins, 
tomatoes, eggplant, peppers, onions (from seeds), leeks, okra, potatoes (main crop), rutabagas. 

2. Successive Crops — Radish, spinach, lettuce, peas, beans (dwarf), parsley, turnips, kohl-rabi, 

3. Early Crops Which May Be Followed by Others* — Onion sets, beets (early), turnips (early), 
carrots (early), corn (early), cabbage (early). 

4. Late Crops Which May Follow Otherst — Beets (late), spinach, peas (late), celery, cabbage 
(late), Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, kale, endive, flat turnips. 

The gardener should remember that many plant diseases and insects exist in the gar- 
den from year to year. At the end of the growing season, therefore, the garden should be 
carefully cleaned of rubbish, the stems of plants, leaves, etc. It is necessary to burn this 
debris promptly, as any disease spores or insects which may be present are then surely 
destroyed. 

CULTURAL SUGGESTIONS FOR THE COMMONER VEGETABLES 

RADISH 

Radishes are so hardy that they may be grown through the winter in cold frEimes 
in the latitude of Washington and farther South in the open ground. In the North they 
require hotbeds, but can be sown in the open ground as soon as the soil is moderately 
warm. They should be planted in drills 12 to 18 inches apart cind thinned slightly as soon 
as the plants are up. On a quick, rich soil some of the earlier varieties can be matured in 
from three to four weeks after planting. If the plants are allowed to remain long in the 
open ground, the roots lose their crispness and delicate flavor, and in order to secure a 
constant supply successive planting should be made every two weeks. One ounce of radish 
seed is sufficient to plant 100 feet of row. A large percentage of the seed germinates, and 
if the sowing is done carefully later thinning may be unnecessary. The first radishes to 
appear may be pulled as soon as they are of sufficient size, and this will leave enough room 
for those that are a little later. The plant is not suited to hot weather, but should be 
planted in the early spring and late autumn. 

LETTUCE 

Lettuce does not withstand heat well and thrives best, therefore, in the early 
spring or late autumn. In order to have the leaves crisp and tender it is necessary to force 
the growth of the plant. The usual method of growing lettuce for home use is to sow the 
seeds broadcast in the bed euid to remove the leaves as rapidly as they become large 
enough for use. It is better, however, to sow the seeds in rows 14 to 16 inches apart, 
and when the plants come up to thin them to the desired distance. With the heading type 
this should be about 1 2 inches apart. This will result in the formation of rather compact 
heads and the entire plant may then be cut for use. For an early crop in the North, the 
plants should be started in a hotbed or cold frame and transplanted as soon as hard 
freezes are over. In many sections of the South the seeds are sown during the autumn 
and the plant allowed to remain in the ground over winter. Frequent shallow cultivation 
should be given the crop and, if crisp, tender letuce is desired during the summer months, 
some form of partial shading may be necessary. 

For head lettuce. Big Boston, Hanson, and California Cream Butter are good 
varieties. For loose-leaf lettuce. Grand Rapids or Black-seeded Simpson is recommended. 



* In addition to the vegetables listed in this group, all of those listed in Group 2 may be followed 
by other crops. 

t Group 2 crops also may follow early crops. 



KITCHEN GARDEN— CULTURED SUGGESTIONS 493 

PEAS 

Garden peas are not injured easily by light frosts and may be planted as soon as 
the soil can be put in order in the spring. By selecting a number of varieties it is possible 
to have a continuous supply of peas throughout a large portion of the growing season. In 
order to accomplish this, plantings should be made every ten days or 2 weeks until warm 
weather comes. The Brst plantings should be of small-growing, quick-maturing varieties, 
such as Alaska, First and Best, and Gradus. These kinds do not require supports. They 
should be followed by the large wrinkled type of peas, such as Champion of Elngland, Tele- 
phone, and Prize Taker. These may be supported on brush, on strings attached to stakes 
driven in the ground, or on wire netting. 

Peas should be planted about 2 to 3 inches deep in rows 3 to 4 feet apart. Some 
gardeners, however, follow the practice of planting in double rows 6 inches apart, with 
the ordinary space of 3 to 4 feet between these pairs of rows. With varieties requiring 
support this is a good practice, as the supports can be placed in the narrow space between 
the rows. / ■ , 

ONIONS 

The onion will thrive under a wide range of climate and soil conditions, but a rich 
sandy loam containing plenty of humus is best suited to it. As the crop requires shallow 
cultivation and it may be necessary to resort to hand work in order to keep it free from 
weeds, it is very desirable that the land should be in such condition that it is easily worked. 
As a general rule, it is well to have the crop follow some other that has been kept under 
the hoe and free from weeds the previous seeison. 

In the North seed is sown as early in the spring as the soil can be brought to the 
proper condition. In the South, onion sets are frequently put out in the autumn and carried 
through the winter with the protection of a little hay or straw. There are three methods 
of propagating onions: The first by sowing the seed in rows where the crop is to grow; 
second, by sowing the seed in specially prepared beds and transplanting the seedlings to 
the open ground; and, third, by planting sets which have been kept through the winter. 
The first method is used by large commercial growers on account of the amount of labor 
involved in the others. 

On small areas, however, it may be preferable to plant sets. Under normal condi- 
tions these usually may be obtained at planting time for about 25 or 30 cents a quart. This 
should be enough for the average family. Onions planted from sets will ripen earlier than 
those from seed sown in the fields. 

When the transplanting method is used, the seed is sown in greenhouses, hotbeds, 
cold frames, or specially prepared beds at the rate of 3'/2 to 4 pounds for each acre to be 
planted. One-half ounce should furnish plants sufficient for the home garden. The seedlings 
are transplanted when they are somewhat sirvaller than a lead pencil and rather stocky. The 
root end of the seedling is pushed into the soil with one finger, and the soil is then firmed 
about the plant. 

The seed is sown thickly in drills about 12 to 14 inches apart. After the plants 
become established they are thinned to 2 or 3 inches apart. The maturity of the bulbs 
may be hastened by preventing the continued growth of the tops. This is sometimes ac- 
complished by rolling an empty barrel over the rows and breaking down the tops. After 
these are practically dead the onion bulbs may be pulled up by hand from the soil and 
spread in a dry, well-ventilated place to cure. Thereafter they may be stored in crates or 
bags for winter use. In the North the crop ripens and is harvested during the latter part 
of the summer and early autumn. In the Southern States, where the crop is grown during 
the winter, the harvesting and marketing period takes place during the spring months. 



494 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK-^ection XI— KITCHEN GARDEN 



There are several kinds of onions that may remain in the soil over winter. The 
multiplier, or potato onion, for example, can be planted from sets in the autumn and will 
produce excellent green early onions. A large onion of this type contains a number of dis- 
tinct hearts, and, if planted, will produce a number of small onions. On the other hand, 
a small onion contains but one heart and will produce a large onion. A few of the large 
ones may be planted each year to produce sets for the following year's planting. 

The shallot is a variety of small onion that is frequently planted in early spring 
for its small bulbs, or "cloves," which are used in the same manner as onions. The leaves 
are utilized for flavoring. Another onion-like plant is the chive, the small, round, hollow 
leaves of which are used for flavoring soups. These leaves may be cut freely, as they are 
soon replaced by others. 

THE PRINCIPAL ROOT CROPS 

Beets can be planted comparatively early in the season. It is not necessary to wait 
until the ground has become warm, if the danger of frost is past. The seed should be 
sown in drills 1 4 to 18 inches apart and covered to a depth of about 1 inch. As soon as 
the plants are well up they should be thinned to stand 3 to 4 inched apart. From 2 to 3 
plantings should be made in order to have a continuous supply of young, tender beets. 

Parsnips, salsify, carrots, and turnips are all handled much like beets. Of the five, 
carrots can perhaps be left closer in the row than the others, about 2 or 3 inches apart. 
This plant, too, is less exacting in so far as fertility is concerned. Salsify, on the other hand, 
demands very fertile and finely cultivated soil. 

POTATOES* 

The potato plant thrives best in sandy or gravelly loam soils. It may be grown 
with a fair degree of success on any type of soil except loose sand and a heavy, sticky clay, 
provided the land is well' drained and contains the necessary plant food. 

Successful potato production is dependent to a large extent on the thoroughness 
with which the land is prepared before planting the crop. Where a horse can be used, 
the land should be plow^ed from 8 to 1 inches deep, provided the surface soil is of a 
sufficient depth to permit it. It is never advisable to turn up more than 1 inch of raw sub- 
soil at any one plowing; so if previous plowings have not been over 6 inches, the maximum 
depth at which it should be plowed is 7 inches. 

Where hand labor is employed the same rule should govern as to depth. In spad- 
ing, especially on grass or waste land, turn the earth bottom side up. Whether the land 
is plowed or spaded, it should be thoroughly pulverized immediately afterwards. Where 
horse labor can be used, the land after plowing should be thoroughly disked first, then 
spring-toothed, and finally finished with a smoothing harrow. Where land must be pre- 
pared by hand, it is good practice to pulverize the soil as much as possible when spading 
it up, after which it can be put in a fine condition of mellowness with a steel garden rake. 
The importance of thoroughly fining the soil cannot be overemphasized. 

Varieties Adapted to Different Localities 

E^ly Varieties — In the Northeastern United States and along the South Atlantic 
seaboard, the Irish Cobbler, Early Petoskey, or Early Standard, all of which are practically 
identical, may be expected to produce larger crops and be more generally satisfactory for 
an early crop than the others mentioned. Quick Lunch and New Queen would be regarded 
as second choices for this section. 

In the South Central and Southwestern States, the Triumph may be expected to 
give results equal to or even better than the Irish Cobbler. 

* Circular 87 of the Bureau of Entomology deals with the Colorado potato beetle, and Farmers' 
Bulletin 557 deals with the potato tuber moth. 



KITCHEN GARDEN— CULTURED SUGGESTIONS 495 

In the Middle West, the Elarly Ohio should do well, while the Early Harvest and 
Early Rose may be regarded as second choices. 

Late Varieties — In the New England States, Long Island, and northern New York, 
the Green Mountain, Gold Coin, Delaware, and other late varieties of that class do best. 

In northern Michigcin, Wisconsin, and Minnesota, the late varieties named above 
do about as well as the Rural New Yorker No. 2, and are superior to it in table quality. 

In western New York, southern Michigan and Wisconsin, and Iowa, the Rural New 
Yorker No. 2, Sir Walter Raleigh, and Carman No. 3 are the best adapted varieties, and 
divide honors with the Green mountain in the northern portions of these States. 

Throughout Maryland, Virginia, the Carolinas, Tennessee, and Georgia, the variety 
known as McCormick is quite generally grown as a late variety. In a favorable season the 
Green Mountain can also be grown. 

When to Plant Potatoes 

The date of planting necessarily must be governed by climatic conditions. In at- 
tempting to produce as early a crop as possible some risk must always be incurred of the 
plants being injured by late spring frosts. As a general proposition it is best to plant pota- 
toes as soon as there is little likelihood of killing frosts after the plants are up and the ground 
is in condition to work. 

The following dates of planting for various cities should be regarded only as the 
approximate time at which early potatoes might safely be planted: 

March 15 to 25: Washington, Baltimore, Philadelphia, Cincinnati, Louisville, St. 
Louis. 

March 25 to April 5: New York, Indianapolis, Detroit, Chicago. 

April 5 to 15: Boston, Albany, Rochester, etc. 

In the northern cities, late varieties should be planted from three to four weeks 
later. 

Planting Practices 

The usual method of preparing potatoes for planting is to cut them into rather 
large pieces, containing several eyes. When seed potatoes are unusually expensive, however, 
it may be well to cut cone-shaped segments of meat around each eye and to use the remain- 
ing portion of the tubers for food. Under this plan it is not necessary to prepare the seed 
all at one time. From day to day the cones for seeding can be cut from the potatoes as 
they are being prepared for the table. The cuttings then should be spread out on a piece 
of paper in a moderately cool room (about 50 degrees F. ) and allowed to remain there 
until they have cured; that is, until the cut surface has become dry. A day or two should 
sufRce for this, and potatoes then should be put in a shallow box or tray and placed where 
it is still cooler. Any storage condition that will insure them against frost on the one hand 
and undue shriveling on the other should prove satisfactory. 

These seeds can be started indoors, provided it is possible to secure suitable soil 
and boxes. In such cases it may be desirable to plant the eye cuttings at once, and allow 
them to start into growth indoors with the idea of transplanting them into the open ground 
when danger of frost is past and the ground is dry enough to be cultivated. 

The smaller the size of the set, or seed piece, used the more thorough must be the 
preparation of the soil. The more finely the soil is pulverized and the more uniform the 
moisture conditions which can be preserved in the soil, the better is the chance for the small 
seed piece to establish itself. A small set in rough, lumpy, or dried-out soil has little 
chance to live. 

Generally speaking, the smaller the size of the set the closer it should be planted 
in the row if maximum yields are to be secured. Such sets may be expected to give the

THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Section XI— KITCHEN GARDEN 



best yields if not spaced more than 10 to 12 inches apart in the row. Plant the small eye 
cuttings from 1 J/2 to 3 inches deep, depending upon the character of the soil — the lighter 
the soil the greater the depth of planting. Larger sets may be planted 4 inches deep. 

Spacing 

If an early variety is planted, and the work is to be done by hand, the rows may 
be spaced as close as 26 inches, whereas, if cultivation is to be done with a horse, 30 to 34 
inches usually is allowed. In order to give the gardener some idea of the number of sets 
required to plant a plot of ground 50 by 100 feet at different spacings, the following table 
is submitted:

If a late variety is pleinted, the spacing should be greater, say, 34 to 36 inches 
between the rows and 12 to 14 inches between the plants in the row. The closeness of 
planting should be determined, first, by the variety, and, second, by the amount of available 
plant food and moisture in the soil or that can be applied to it. 

CORN 

Corn to be at its best should be eaten within a few Hours after it is picked, for its 
sugar content disappears very rapidly after it is removed from the garden. For this reason 
and because of its very general popularity it is an excellent vegetable to grow in the home 
garden. It should be planted on rich land and cultivated in the same manner as field com. 
Beginning as soon as thai soil is warm, successive plantings may be made every two or three 
weeks until late summer. Another method of prolonging the supply is to plant early, 
medium, and late varieties. The seed should be planted about 2 inches deep, in drills 3 
feet apart, and thinned to a single stalk every 1 to 14 inches. 

The following varieties are recommended: For early corn. Golden Bantam and 
Adams Early, and for medium and late varieties. Black Mexican or Crosby's Early, Coun- 
try Gentleman, and Stowell's Evergreen. The last-named variety heis the largest ears and 
is the most productive. 

Corn should be planted on rich land. The cultivation should be frequent and 
thorough and all weeds should be kept down and suckers removed from around the base 
of the plant 

TOMATOES 

Tomato plants should be started in the house or in a hotbed and should be trans- 
planted once or twice in order that strong and vigorous plants may be secured by the 
time all danger from frost is past. Pot-grown plants are especially desirable, as they may 
be brought to the blooming period by the time it is warm enough to plant them with 
safety in the garden. If the plants are not to be trained, but are to be allowed to lie on 
the ground, they should be set about 4 feet apart each way. If trimmed and tied to stetkes 
they may be planted in rows 3 feet apart and 1 8 inches apart in the row. TTie home 
gardener will find the latter method preferable. ' 



KITCHEN GARDEN— CULTURED SUGGESTIONS 497 

In common with all plants grown in a house, hotbed, or cold fraime, tomatoes 
require to be hardened off before they are planted in the garden. By this process the plants 
are gradually acclimated to the effects of the snn and wind, so that they will stand trans- 
planting to the open ground. Hardening off usually is accompanied by ventilating freely 
and by reducing the amount of water applied to the plant bed. The bed, however, should 
not become so dry that the plants will wilt or become seriously checked in their gnrowth. 
After a few days it will be possible to leave the plants uncovered during the entire day and 
on mild nights. 

EGGPLANTS AND PEPPERS 

Eggplants and peppers are started and handled in the same way as the tomato. 
The soil best adapted for their production is a fine, rich, sandy loam, well drained. The 
plants should be set in rows 3 feet apart and 2 feet apart in the row. Free cultivation is 
desirable, and the plants should be kept growing rapidly. A dozen good healthy plants 
each of eggplant and pepper should supply enough fruits for the average sized family 
throughout the season. Both of these vegetables are heat-loving and should not be set 
in the open until the ground has become warm. 



BEANS 

Beans are more susceptible to cold that peas and should not be planted until dan- 
ger of frost is past and the ground begins to warm up. They are, however, among the 
most desirable vegetables that the home gardener can raise. There are many different kinds 
and varieties of beans, but for garden purposes they may be divided into two classes — 
string and Lima. Both classes are grown in practically all parts of the United States where 
the frost-free period is greater than three months and adapt themselves to a wide diversity 
of soils and climate. They grow rapidly, and, therefore, leave the area in which they 
have been planted free for another crop. To secure a continuous supply, it is desirable 
to make plantings at intervals of 1 days or 2 weeks from the time that the ground is 
reasonably warm until hot weather sets in. 

Both string and Lima beans are subdivided into pole and bush types. Pole Lima 
beans should be planted with from 8 to 1 seeds in the hill, and after the plants become 
established should be thinned to 3 or 4. The hills should be 4 or 5 feet apart. Bush Lima 
beans are planted 5 or 6 inches apart in rows 30 to 36 inches apart. Bush beans of the 
string type may be planted somewhat closer — the plants standing 3 or 4 inches apart in 
rows from 20 to 24 inches apart if hand cultivation only is to be employed. 

Beans of any kind should not be planted any deeper than is necessary to secure 
good germination. This should never be over 2 inches and on heavy soil it should not be 
more than 1 '/^ to 1 Yl inches. 

Beans are useful in the home garden, since they thrive on practically any type of 
soil. The pole varieties are especially convenient, since they can be planted along the edges 
of the yard and permitted to climb on the fences. Some of the pole beans, both snap and 
Lima, vyrill continue to bear until frost. If the pole beans are planted in the hills in the 
garden proper, it will be necessary to sink a pole at each hill or to provide some other 
form of support. Extra long poles may be used and the tops of three or four different 
hills fastened together tent fashion. If it is desired to keep the garden free from poles, 
substantial posts may be set at each end of the row and a wire or strong cord stretched 
between their tops. Cords may then be extended from small stakes in each hill to the 
wire. 



498 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK-^ection XI— KITCHEN GARDEN 

CUCUMBERS, SQUASHES, AND MELONS 

Cucumbers, squashes,* and melons all belong to the melon family and demand much 
the same treatment. All are heat-loving and should not be planted in the open until the 
ground has become warm. It is easily possible, however, to give the plants an early start 
in the house and so gain several weeks in earliness of maturity. One way is to plant seven, 
or eight seeds in berry boxes filled with soil. Each box of growing plants should have its 
bottom removed at planting time and should then be sunk in the garden to constitute a 
hill of plants. 

Instead of growing the plants in boxes of ordinary soil they may be grown on sods 
in a suitable receptacle. Cut sods 6 inches square from spots which the growth of grass 
shows to be rich. Turn these g*abs side down and press the seeds in among the roots and 
soil. Cover with about an inch^nd a half of good soil and keep moist and warm. At 
planting time the sods may be vfted and placed in hills, which first should have manure 
worked into them. ' 

■These plants are rank growers and occupy much space. In very small gardens it 
may be well, therefore, to omit them. If squashes ai« grown, it may be well to plant only 
bunch varieties. Space may be conserved by growmg a few cucumber vines near the edge 
of the garden and training them on a fence. This is possible, too, of course, with some 
melons and pumpkins, but supports will be necessary for the fruits. If the plants of this 
group are grown in the main garden, they must be spaced from 6 to 1 2 feet apart each 
way. 

CABBAGE, CAULIFLOWER, AND BRUSSELS SPROUTS 

Cabbage and the other two members of the cabbage family mentioned here require 
much the same treatment. f All three are grown in hotbeds, frames, or flats for the early 
crop and are set out when all danger of frost is past. Of the three, Brussels sprouts is 
the hardiest. Cabbage is fairly hardy, but cauliflow^er is somewhat tender. All require 
rather moist soil andj plenty of plant food. Fertilizer may be conserved by placing it under 
each "hill" before the plants are set. The settings should be made 18 to 24 inches apart 
in rows spaced about 24 inches. 

MISCELLANEOUS SALAD VEGETABLES 

Besides lettuce there are a number of vegetables for use as salads or cooked greens 
that may be grown easily in the home garden. Of the salad plants, corn salad, garden 
cress, and endive are perhaps best known. The first two may be planted early. Endive, 
however, is planted in June and July. All are grown in drills about 14 inches apart and 
are thinned to proper distances as they grow. 

Spinach and mustard are useful greens for cooking. Spinach may be grown either 
in the spring or in the fall. It is grown in drills, the use of the larger plants first auto- 
matically taking care of thinning. 

Mustard greens may be produced on almost any good soil. The basal leaves are 
used for greens and are cooked like spinach. The plants require but a short time to reach 
the proper stage for use and frequent sowings should be made. The seeds are sowed 
thickly in drills as early as possible in spring or for late use in September or October. 
Ostrich Plume is a reliable variety. 

For use both as a salad plant and for cooked greens Swiss chard, a beet which has 
been developed for foliage, should be more extensively grown. One of the good points 
about this vegetable is that crop after crop of leaves may be cut without injuring the plant. 
Chard is planted like beets in drills 1 2 to 14 inches apart and thinned to 4 to 6 inches. 

* An insect that attacks squashes and other crops of this class is described in Farmers' Bulletin 668, 
"The Squash-vine Borer." 

t Accounts of two insects that attack cabbage are given in Farmers' Bulletin 766, "The Common 
Cabbage Worm," and Circular 103 of the Bureau of Entomology, "The Harlequin Cabbage Bug." 



KITCHEN GARDEN— CULTURED SUGGESTIONS 499 



PERMANENT VEGETABLES 

A number of vegetables, once established, will furnish a supply of their products 
year after year. Asparagus, rhubarb, and a number of garnishing and flavoring herbs are 
the best-known members of this group. Because they permanently occupy the space in which 
they grow, such plants should be in beds separated from the cultivated vegetables. 

For the asparagus bed a well drained, early location should be chosen. Prepare 
the bed by digging a trench 18 inches wide and 20 inches deep. Fill this one-third full 
with well-rotted manure and tramp it down well. Half fill the remaining space with good 
soil, and on this set the root clumps of asparagus, I foot apart. Such roots, one, two, or 
three years old, may be purchased from seedsmen or nurseries. Cover the roots by filling 
the trench to the surface of the ground with good soil. The stalks should not be cut until 
a year after planting, and then but lightly. Full harvests may be taken after this. From a 
dozen to two dozen roots should be enough for the average family. 

Rhubarb is also grown from root clumps. A row of six or eight plants, 4 feet 
apart, should furnish stalks enough for the average family. Each hill should be well pre- 
pared with manure and good soil. Se' the crowns about 4 inches underground. Stalks 
should not be cut until a year after planting. v ' 

Parsley seeds are sown in a drill in spring. The plants ▼ill die down in the fall 
and put out fresh foliage the next spring. The plant is a biennial and must be replanted at 
two-year intervals. 

Sage is a useful perennial herb which can be grown easily in the home garden. 
One or two bushes will furnish an abundance of leaves. These, when full grown, should 
be thoroughly dried and stored in cans or jars. 

ANNUAL PLANTS USED FOR SEASONING 

Chives are small onionlike plants having flat, hollow leaves. These are cut and used 
for flavoring soups, sauces, etc. The plants are propagated by bulbs. A patch of the 
plants a foot or so square should be enough for the home garden. 

Okra, or gumbo, produces pods which are used to season and thicken soups. The 
seeds of okra should be sown in the open after the ground has become quite warm, or the 
plants may be started in berry boxes in the hotbed or in the house and transplanted in the 
garden after all danger of frost has passed. The rows should be 4 feet apart for the dwarf 
sorts and 5 feet apart for the tall kinds, with the plants 2 feet apart in the row.* If the 
pods are removed before they are allowed to ripen, the plants will continue to produce 
them until killed by frost. 

Cabbage, carrots, turnips, and rutabagas, in addition to their use as early crops, 
may be planted early in summer and the products which mature in autumn may then be 
held for winter use. 

VEGETABLES FOR WINTER USE 

For a late crop of cabbage it is customary to plant the seeds in a bed in the open 
ground in May or June and transplant them to the garden in July. For cabbage of this 
character the soil should be heavier and more retentive of moisture than for early cabbage, 
which requires a rich, warm soil in order to reach maturity quickly. For the late variety 
it is not desirable to have too rich a soil, as the heads are liable to burst. Cabbages should 
be set in rows 30 to 36 inches apart, and plants standing 14 to 18 inches apart in the row. 
To store cabbage for the winter the heads should be buried in pits or placed in cel- 
lars. One method is to dig a trench about 1 8 inches deep and 3 feet wide and set the 
cabbage upright with the heads close together and the roots embedded in the soil. When 
cold weather comes the heads are covered lightly with straw and 3 or 4 inches of earth 

•Detailed information on this plant is contained in Farmers' Bulletin 232, "Okra: Its Culture and 
Uses." 



500 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK-^ection XI— KITCHEN GARDEN 

put in. Slight freezing does not injure cabbage, but it should not be subjected to repeated 
freezing and thawing. 

Parsnips will occupy the ground from early spring until fall. The seeds should be 
sown as early as convenient in the spring in rows 18 inches to 3 feet apart. The plaints 
should later be thinned to stand 3 inches apart in the row. A rich soil with frequent cul- 
tivation is necessary for success with this crop. The roots are dug late in the fall and stored 
in cellars or pits, much as cabbage is, or else are allowed to remain where they are grown 
and are dug as required for use. All roots not dug during the winter, however, should be 
removed from the garden, as they will produce seed the second season and become of a 
weedy nature. When the parsnip has been allowed to run wild in this way the root is con- 
sidered to be poisonous. 

Carrots may be sown early, used during the late summer, and the surplus stored. 
If desired, a later crop may be sown after the removal of an early vegetable, especially for 
winter use. Carrots are grown in practically the same way as parsnips, but are not thinned 
so much and are allowed to grow almost as thickly as planted. They are dug in the autumn 
and stored in the same manner as parsnips or turnips. 

Turnips require a rich soil and may be grown either as an early or late crop. For 
a late crop it is customary to sow the seeds broadcast on land from which some early crop 
has been removed. In the North this is generally done during July and August, but the 
usual time is later in the South. The seed also may be sown in drills 12 to 18 inches apart 
as for the early crop. After the plants appear they are thinned to about 3 inches. 

The rutabaga is similar to the turnip and is grown in much the same way. It re- 
quires more space, however, and a longer period for its growth. It is used to a considerable 
extent for stock feed and has the advantage of being quite hardy. 

FRUITS IN THE SMALL GARDEN— BERRIES 

If there is sufficient space in the home garden, it may be desirable to have it supply 
fruits as well as vegetables. The small fruits, such as strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, 
currants, and gooseberries, may be produced with little trouble. A few dozen strawberry 
plants, and even few of the other plants mentioned, should be sufficient for a start. The 
plantings can be increased from year to year by resetting the young plants which spring 
up from runners and roots. All the small fruit plants mentioned may be set out in spring. 
Since most of these plants will occupy the same space year after year, they should be 
segregated from the part of the garden devoted to annual vegetables. 

Grapes may, in many instances, be g^rown in the home garden more easily than the 
small bush fruits, since they may be planted near fences and permitted to run upon them. 
Grape plants also may be set put in spring before the sap rises. Fairly large holes should 
be dug, and these filled with rich soil mixed with wood ashes. 

TREE FRUITS 

Tree fruits probably cannot be grown in most small home gardens because of the 
relatively large areas of soil their roots occupy. The use of dwarf trees, however, makes 
possible the growing of a few fruit trees in the larger yards and garden inclosures. Though 
strawberries, cucumbers, and a few other vegetables may be grown near the trees while 
the latter are small, most vegetables must be grown in the open, where they will receive 
abundant sunlight. If fruit trees are grown in connection with gardening operations, there- 
fore, they should, where possible, be well removed from the main garden plot. 

Apple, peach, cherry, pear, plum, apricot, and quince trees may be purchased on 
dwarfing stocks. All may be set out in the spring before growth starts. The trees should 
be set in holes several feet square in which rich soil has been placed. They should be set 
an inch or so lower than in the nursery.

ALPHABETICAL INDEX 
Where to find the information contained in this volume. 

How to Use the Index — Note the following: 

On subjects of a general nature, particularly where treatment is in a writ- 
ten discussion or study rather than in brief paragraphs or specific recipes, always 
look on pages preceding and following, as well as on the page given. Other mat- 
ter bearing on the subject will thus be found, often matter on the specific subject 
and almost invariably on such closely related subject-matter as to be of material 
relation to the subject sought. 

But do not get the "Index Habit" — do not turn to the Index always before 
you do anything else. The Index is intended as a guide where you want every- 
thing bearing on a given subject. It is not necessary where you want a simple 
recipe only, or the solution to some simple problem. For illustration, if you are 
on the subject of Breads: You wll probably find the Bread Recipe you want under 
the Classification, Breads, in Part 2, Cooking and Recipes, of Section IV, The 
Kitchen and Cookery. If you want to look up War Breads using no wheat or wheat 
substitutions, you wiH look for them in the Food Administration Supplement. If 
you want to look up every pertinent reference made to Breads, Breads as a Carbo- 
hydrate Food, Breads in Diet Value, Bread Substitute Materials, etc., etc., you will 
consult the Index on Breads, as well as on Flour, on Substitutes, Children's Foods, 
Invalids' Diets, on Corn Meal, and under such other related headings as are sug- 
gested to you by the purposes for which you want the information; and you wU 
thus get together a complete scientific study on every angle of the Bread question. 

Familiarize yourself in a general way with the Book itself, and you will find 
yourself able to turn naturally, for all usual purposes, at once to the Section and 
page you want, without any poring over the Index. The Book is almost self-indexed 
in the way of its arrangement; wth a very little familiarity it at least becomes so 
for all practical ends.

Don't Expect to Find every sort of individual recipe in the Index. Look for 
it under its proper classification in the Book itself. We do not encumber the 
Index with such items as Waldorf Salad or Peach Pie, which one will naturally 
look for under Salad or Pie (Pastry). Only such recipes are indexed as to the 
classification of which one might be uncertain.

Food Administration 
SUPPLEMENT 

With Sub-Supplement 
for the Fuel Administration 



THIS SUPPLEMENT 

is prepared principally 

from bulletins 
issued by the 

U. S. Food Administration 

together with bulletins 
of the 

Fuel Administration 
Department of Agriculture 

of the U. S., and of New York 
and other States 



The contents are of serious 
import as bearing on the im- 
mediate needs of our country 
in the War Situation 



Current as of Date 
July, 1918 



S-l 



The following pages will be changed with 
subsequent editions 

for the purpose of adapting each edition as fully as pos- 
sible to the latest current doctrines and recommenda- 
tions of the U. S. Food Administration, the Department 
of Agriculture and other national and state commissions 
and bureaus in 

helping the public solve the special 
economic problems relating to the 
disturbed conditions to which the 
American public must now and 
shall be compelled to continue to 
make constant readjustment. 

It is thought best that the main body of the volume 
shall not be too far amended to fit these changing con- 
ditions. The Home-Keeping Book is intended for a 
permanent addition to the home library. The text of 
the book should remain as it is compiled, to fit usual 
and normal times, amended only to fit changes w^hich 
will or should become permanent in our manner of life. 

The "home-keeper" however positively must take 
into consideration and put into practice during the 
national emergency the special economies, the substitu- 
tions, and the spirit of co-operation in the stoppage of 
waste and other conservation measures, as are 

specially outlined in the pages 
of this SUPPLEMENT

UNTIL NEXT HARVEST 



UNITED STATES FOOD ADMINISTRATION 



Washington, April, 1918 



Now is the hour of our testing. Let us maike it the hour of our 
victory — victory over ourselves ; victory over the enemy of freedom 
—Home Card, 1918. 

The following restrictions are a military necessity: 

Cut down the consumption of wheat by at least one-half. 

Households keep within a weekly allowance for each person of one and a 
half pounds of flour and all other wheat products. 

Public eating places keep within the same allowance for every twenty-one 
meals served; not more than two ounces of wheat products, flour included, to be 
served to a guest at any one meal. 

Retail purchases of flour to be limited in quantity and to be accompanied by 
at least equal w^eight of other cereals. 

Bakers to keep within 70 per cent, of flour formerly used; three-quarter 
pound loaves to go as far as the pound loaf usually does. 

No wheat to be used in manufacturing for anything but food. 

Let all who can go without wheat. 



THE WHEAT SHORTAGE 

The wheat situation is the most serious in the 
food supply of the Allied World. 

Our harvest was less than estimated; needs of 
the Allies are greater than were calculated; losses 
by sea and by tattle have been heavier than were 
anticipated: less comes from the Argentine than 
had been hoped; tenser demands on shipping space 
restrict ships more than ever to the shortest haul 
and the tightest bulk. 

We have fallen behind in our program. Be- 
cause corn and oats were so tardy in coming to 
market, we have not been able to ship as much as 
we should, we have eaten further into our stock 
of wheat than we would. 

Corn cannot be shipped now. We have sent it 
as fast as we could and we will again. But dur- 
ing the next two months, the season of germina- 
tion, it will not do to ship corn — there is too much 
spoilage in shipment. 

There is no margin anywhere. The Allies have 
wheat to-day but their stocks are down to the dan- 
ger point. We dare not let anything stop the flow 
of wheat overseas. That would be disaster greater 
than defeat of an army. 

We must send wheat — and more wheat — and 
more. To redeem our obligation we must cut 
down by half our own consumption of wheat. 

WHO SHALL BEAR THE BURDEN 

Going without wheat is an inconvenience — noth- 
ing worse — for homes in comfortable circum- 
stances. 

It is no hardship — no danger. Physiologists all 



agree that a wholesome diet need not include wheat. 
The South fought the Civil War three years on 
corn. Early New England did without wheat five 
years at a time with no ill effects. 

Going without wheat is perhaps more expense, 
certainly more work. Not a hardship but a bur- 
den. Who shall bear the burden? 

Shall we ask, the women of France to do it? 
Do you know w^hat it means to them? 

The women of France are doing their own work, 
doing the nation's w^ork, even doing the work of 
teams in the field. 

The men are gone — all but the younger boys, 
the aged and the invalids. In almost every home 
is a cripple or one dying of tuberculosis — an added 
care. 

French homes have not baked bread for hun- 
dreds of years. They have not even ovens nor 
baking tins in their kitchens. They rely on the 
bakery. 

If you ask them to bake their own bread — for 
the bakery cannot supply quick breads — the women 
of France must add another hour to their long 
day of toil. 

Will you ask them to do that? Or shall our 
homes carry the extra burden of doing without 
wheat? 

WHAT TO DO WITH THE FLOUR 

One and a half pounds of wheat flour goes into 
two and a half pounds of Victory bread. That 

gives just about two slices for each meal with 

nothing over for cake, pastry or anything else. 

One pound of wheat flour goes into one-and- 
three-quarter pounds of Victory bread, which 



5-4 



SUPPLEMENT— UNTIL NEXT HARVEST 



S-5 



makes twenty-eight one-ounce slices, or four a day. 
That leaves half a pound of wheat flour for cake, 
pastry, macaroni, and incidental cooking. 

Muffins and biscuit — medium size — made on a 
fifty-fifty recipe, use a quarter ounce each of wheat 
flour. 

A fair slice of cake or a piece of one-crust pie, 
also on a fifty-fifty recipe, likewise takes about 
one-quarter ounce of wheat. 

An ordinary serving of wheaten breakfast foods, 
or a half cup of cooked macaroni or spaghetti con- 
tains an ounce of wheat. 

Wheatless meals and days kept as before, and 
Victory bread at the remaining ten meals, will use 
about t\velve ounces of wheat. 

Going w^ithout wheat at other meals or at all 

meals — let potatoes, rice, hominy and other cereals 
take the place of bread, or bread may be eaten 
that contains no wheat. 

Food Will Win the War! Food to-day means 
first of all Wheat. 

DOING WITHOUT WHEAT 

Bread and milk make a meal; so wil Imush and 
milk. 

Bread and gravy go together; potatoes and gravy 
are just as nourishing. 

Toast and fruit are fine for breakfast; but any 
other cereal with fruit will stay the stomach as 
effectively. 

Griddle cakes, muffins, all sort of quick breads, 
can be filling and appetizing without any wheat. 

After all, what we have to do is eat less bread. 
Often we eat it to convey other food; we even use 
bread to push mouthfuls upon the fork. 

There is one test. Wherever bread is used for 
convenience, that is the place to leave it out. 

Habit tells us to use bread; the body's needs teli 
us only to provide sufficient nourishment. We 
must learn to think in terms of nourishment and 
net let habit hinder us. 

Changing our habits is none too easy. But it is 
no easy task to win the war. 

Going without wheat w^herever we can is one 
thing w^e can do to win the ^var — perhaps the 
largest contribution we can make. 

LET ALL WHO CAN DO MORE 

The best we can do, it will not be enough to 
meet all needs. We cannot make up the subma- 
rine losses, nor replace the spent reserves. 



Doing our utmost, not everyone in this country 
can keep within the allowance. Masses in crowded 
cities, with no proper kitchen outfits, depend on 
bakery bread and ready cooked food. Their habits 
are controlled by their circumstances. 

Those w^ho can must do more to maintain the 
margin. 

Some wheat in any case must be brought from 
Argentine, the less the better. For every voyage 
to the Argentine is the same as taking two vessels 
from the short Atlantic ferry. Every vessel taken 
from that traffic keeps a regiment from the front. 

Going without wheat adds directly to our forces 
in battle. Going without wheat loosens the ship- 
ping tension which limits our armed strength. 

A splendid response comes instantly. Hundreds 
of hotels have pledged themselves to go without 
wheat until harvest. Households, communities, 
countries all over the land have cut down wheat to 
the limit or given it up altogether. 

But the best we can do is too little. Let all 
keep within the allowance; let all who can. do 



WHEAT IS THE TEST 

Germany's war of starvation is a challenge most 
of all to America. 

Against Germany's lust for dominion, America's 
purpose is to establish the society of nations. 
Against destruction, America's aim is healing. 
Against mastery, America's ideal is service. 

We cannot surpass the steadfastness of Britain, 
the courage of taly, the exaltation of France. 

We cannot excell the Allies in heroism, in en- 
durance, in fortitude. Our force in battle though 

it may be decisive — will not be as great as theirs. 

We can hope to contribute most to the common 
cause from our larger resources. To relieve des- 
perate privation, America can supply food. 

Giving up w^heat is a little thing compared to 
their death struggle — in which our soldiers are 
splendidly sharing. 

A little thing — yet we can do it with greatness 
of spirit. Supporting our army and adding whole- 
hearted service to humanity, it is in America's 
power to defeat forever the passion of conquest. 

Now is the hour of our testing. Wheat is the 
Test. 



WAYS IN WHICH WOMEN CAN HELP 
WITH THE LOCAL MARKETING PROBLEM 

1 . Study existing local conditions — not for the purpose merely of criticiz- 
ing, but rather for the purpose of trying to improve marketing facilities. 

(a) Study the general system used in handling foodstuffs locally. 

(b) Learn the various agencies engaged in the business and the services 

performed, as well as the costs assessed by each. 

2 . Co-operate intelligently with dealers, in endeavoring to improve market- 
ing conditions, and be willing to do your share to effect betterments. Consumers 
are largely responsible for expensive and wasteful retail marketing practices, and 
they must help if such practices are to be eliminated. 

3 . Concentrate attention on the elimination of w^aste in home marketing. 

(a) Curtail ordering by telephone so far as possible. 

(b) Never ask unnecessary credit or delivery service. 

(c) Encourage local grocers to adopt a system w^hereby a low cash price 

is placed on goods at the store and fair charges made for 
credit and delivery. This places the cost of credit and delivery 
on those who use it and gives the housew^ife who pays cash and 
carries her packages home a price concession for so doing. 

(d) Develop the marketing habit — personally superintend the buying of 

foodstuffs. 

(e) Study comparative food values and food substitutes. 

(f) Do not get into the habit of asking for the "best" of everything. 

Usually one can find perfectly satisfactory goods among the 
less expensive grades after a little experiment. 

(g) Check up weights and measures of all purchases. 

(h) Study the comparative advantages of "bulk vs. package goods," and 
when bulk goods of satisfactory quality offer a saving insist on 
your dealer carrying them in stock. 

4 . Work through your organizations to interest your newspapers in fur- 
nishing reliable, non-technical market news and market hints for housewives. 

Such a service should keep you informed in regard to the supplies of prod- 
ucts entering the market and the prices which your dealers pay, and offer sugges- 
tions as to the best time to can, preserve or store for winter use. In this service, 
special effort should be made to inform consumers ahead of time of impending 
gluts of certain products, so that plans can be made for utilizing them. 

If such an arrangement cannot be made through newspapers, try to ar- 
range a substitute service whereby committees of organizations will co-operate with 
local produce dealers and public market officials, in securing and disseminating such 
information periodically.

A GUIDE IN BAKING 

SAVE WHEAT — USE WHEAT SUBSTITUTES 

MEASUREMENTS OF SUBSTITUTES EQUAL TO 
ONE CUP OF FLOUR 



These ^veights and measures were tested in the Experimental Kitchen of the U. S. 
Food Administration, Home Conservation Division, and of the U. S. Department of 
Agriculture, Office of Home Economics. 

In substituting for one cup of flour use the following measurements. Each is equal 
in weight to a cup of flour. 

Barley 1 M cups 

Buckwheat Va cup 

Corn flour I cup (scant) 

Corn meal (coarse) Ys cup 

Corn meal (fine) .... 1 cup (scant) 

Cornstarch % cup 

Peanut flour I cup (scant) 



Potato flour % cup 

Rice flour ^ cup 

Rolled oats I ^ cups 

Rolled oats (ground in 

meat choper) I '/g cups 

Soy-bean flour ^ cup 

Sweet potato flour 1 J/g cups 



This table will help you to make good griddle cakes, muffins, cakes, cookies, drop 
biscuits, and nut or raisin bread without using any wheat flour. 

You will not need new recipes. Just use the ones your family has 'always liked, but 
for each cup of flour use the amount of substitute given in the table. You can change 
your muffin recipe like this: 



Old Recipe 

2 cups wheat flour 

4 teaspoons baking powder 

'/4 teaspoon salt 

I tablespoon sugar 

I cup milk 

1 egg 

I tablespoon fat. 



New Recipe 

1 3/g cups barley flour 

I cup (scant) corn flour 

4 teaspoons baking powder 

^ teaspoon salt 

I tablespoon sugar 

I cup milk 

1 egg 

1 tablespoon fat 



The only difference is the substitution for the wheat flour. Everything else remains 
the same. You can change all of your recipes in a similar way. 

GOOD COMBINATIONS OF SUBSTITUTES 

You will get better results if you mix two substitutes than if you use just one alone. 

Some good combinations are 

Rolled oats (ground) 

or 
Barley flour 

or 
Buckwheat flour > and 

or 
Peanut flour 

or 
Soy-bean flour 



Corn flour 

or 
Rice flour 

or 
Potato flour 

or 
Sweet potato flour 

or 
Corn meal 



CAUTIONS 

1. All measurements should be accurate. A standard measuring cup is equal to a half 
pint. 

2. The batter often looks too thick, and sometimes too thin, but you will find that if you 
have measured as given in the table the result will be good after baking. 

3. Bake all substitute mixtures more slowly and longer. • 

4. Drop biscuits are better than the rolled biscuits, when substitutes are used. 

5. Pie crusts often do not roll well and have to be patted on to the pan. They do not 
need chilling before baking.

SPEAKERS* BULLETIN No. 6 
UNITED STATES FOOD ADMINISTRATION 

Washington, February, 1918. 

By order of the U. S. Food Administration: 

With every pound of flour sold at retail, there must be sold 
an equal weight of corn, oats, rice, barley, or other cereal, 
one or any assortment. 

This rule applies to every one aHke. Exception has been made only 
where other cereals were not to be had — only till the shortage could 
be overcome and only by order of the Federal Food Administrator 

The situation has become critical. There is simply not enough food in 
Europe. Yet the soldiers of the Allies must be maintained in full strength; their 
wives and children at home must not face famine; the friendly neutrals must not 
be starved; and, finally, our ow^n army in France must never lack a needed ounce 
of food. — Herbert Hoover, 1918 Home-Card. 

Unless you are able to send the Allies at least 75,000,000 bushels of vv^heat 
over and above what you have exported up to January 1st, and in addition to the 
total exportable surplus from Canada, I cannot take the responsibility of assuring 
our people that there will be food enough to win the war. — Lord Rhondda, British 
Food Controller, cable, January, 1918. 



Whether it suits us or not, 

whether we like it or not, 
whether it costs more or less, 
we shall eat of our other cereals 
measure for measure with wheat. 



To create a supply of wheat 

the Nation draws on its other grains. 

The fifty-fifty rule, 

binding on everyone everywhere, 
makes all share and share alike. 



THEIR NEED IS DESPERATE 

The Allies need from 75,000,000 to 90.000.000 
bushels more of American w^heat. We have al- 
ready exported the theoretical surplus of last har- 
vest. We have saved from 25.000,000 to 50,000.- 
000 bushels during the last five months, which we 
are now exporting. 

We cannot and will not export more than our 
savings. The Allies have sharply reduced their 
bread ration to their own people, and if this low- 
ered ration is to be maintained we must save more 
than hitherto. 

Every grain of wheat and every ounce of flour 
and bread saved now is exactly that amount sup- 
plied to some man, woman, or child among the 
Allies. 

UNITED STATES FOOD ADMINISTRATION 
January 11, 1918 



OUR DUTY IS IMPERATIVE 

The Allies find their supply of breadstuffs run- 
ning low^. 

It is imperative that we send them an increased 
amount of flour to strengthen the fighting lines 
and keep alive the men and women of France and 
England, Italy and Belgium, who for more than 
three years have had to bear the terrible priva- 
tions of w^ar. 

More flour is also needed by our soldiers abroad. 

To send them and the Allies the flour required 
bakers and housewives must loyally join in using 
larger quantities of wheat-flour substitutes.

THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— SUPPLEMENT 



PRESIDENT WILSON'S APPEAL 

Many causes have contributed to create the ne- 
cessity for a more intensive effort on the part of 
our people to save food in order that we may 
supply our associates in the war with the sus- 
tenance vitally necessary to them in these days of 
privation and stress. 

The reduced productivity of Europe because of 
the large diversion of man power to the war, the 
partial failure of harvests, and the elimination of 
more distant markets for foodstuffs through the 
destruction of shipping, places the burden of their 
subsistence very largely on our shoulders. 

The maintenance of the health and strength of 
our own people is vitally necessary at this time, 
and there should be no dangerous restriction of 
the food supply; but the elimination of every sort 
of waste and the substitution of other commodi- 
ties of which we have more abundant supplies for 
those which we need to save will in no way impair 
the strength of our people and will enable us to 
meet one of the most pressing burdens of the war. 

— By the President, January 18, 1918 

IN THE GRIP OF NECESSITY 

Americans have done a wonderful thing by 
voluntary saving. The like was never done be- 
fore by any people. But we have not done enough. 
Necessity tightens its grip. The crisis grows more 
tense. We must do more — and more — and more 
— or we are undone. 

At the first it was reckoned that saving one 
slice of bread in five would make plenty. Millions 
began saving. But not enough. Some could not, 
some would not, some cared not. Europe's needs 
rose; the submarine toll increased; trade circuits 
shortened; losses were to be made up; new drafts 
were to be met. 

By November it was known that we must set our 
tables with more of corn and oats and other grains. 
But they had not come to market. Until they 
reached the stores, we had to eat further into our 
stock of wheat, expecting to lean more heavily on 
other cereals when they were delivered. 

DRAWING ON RESERVES 

By December we had shipped all the normal 
surplus of wheat. The fall's saving would carry 
us part way; for the rest we had to create a new 
surplus by drawing on the reserves of other grain. 

A new assessment of our obligation was made. 
It was announced: Our object is that we should 
reduce by one-third our consumption of wheat. 
To fulfill that purpose a schedule of wheatless days 
and meals was promulgated. 

Still the markets offered no substitutes. Rail- 
roads were strangled by terminal blockades and 
smothered in cold and snow. Masses of foodstuffs, 
inert in granaries and corncribs, might as well 
have been in Tibet for all the help they gave the 



day's needs — the \varehouse was choke-full; there 
was no flow to market. Not till near the end of 
February was a current stock of one or another 
substitute assured for every region. 

ALL CEREALS A SINGLE RESOURCE 

It was high time. The Food Administration 
dared put off no longer the protection of our 
wheat reserves. In our half of the world, all grain 
is virtually a common stock. The Allies have 
their barley and rice, and without much difficulty 
we are making up their shortage of coarse grains. 
We have plenty of cereals all told; we must make 
up the wheat deficit of our associates by drawing 
on our reserves of coarse grains. 

At last we have in every market in the United 
States enough of one or more substitutes to go 
with the wheat. 

To meet the situation, then, the Victory bread 
regulation has been adopted and the fifty-fifty rule. 

Whoever bakes bread, pastry, or other wheat 
products must mingle with the wheat flour at least 
one-fifth of other cereal or potatoes. This is Vic- 
tory bread. 

Whoever sells wheat flour or other wheat prod- 
ucts niust sell with it an equal weight of other 
cereals. This is the fifty-fifty rule. 

FIFTY-FIFTY IN THE HOME 

This is no radical change in diet; only a modi- 
fication. Cereals are part of our ordinary fare. 
Many families begin the day with oatmeal or corn 
flakes. In the South corn bread is as common as 
wheat. In the Southwest feterita flour, elsewhere 
unknown, has become a staple. On the Pacific 
coast they have rice. Fifty-fifty is to be compared 
with customary buying of, say, thirty to sixty. 

One calculation shows an average consumption 
in American homes of two-thirds wheat and one- 
third other cereals. Another reckoning accounts 
for sales running 8,000,000 barrels of flour to 
6,000,000 barrels of other sorts. 

Briefly, the housewife who has been doing with 
two-thirds wheat and one-third other cereals must 
absorb equal quantities,' which means changing 
from white bread to Victory breads and serving 
more frequently the quick breads, muffins, break- 
fast foods, porridges, and the like. 

SHIFTING THE PROPORTIONS 

Each housewife must work out her problem by 
her own ingenuity and skill, as hardly two families 
have the same habits and tastes. Those learned 
in domestic economy can tell what other adjust- 
ments must be made as the bread quotas are shift- 
ed. But, roughly, this is the problem: 

Given a family using 66 pounds of wheat and 
33 of other cereals: To change to fifty-fifty. Change 
white bread to Victory bread, mixing at least one- 
fifth meal with the flour. That reduces the white 
flour from 66 to 53 pounds and uses up 13 pounds 



SUPPLEMENT— FIFTY-FIFTY 



S-I3 



of the assorted cereals. To cut down white flour 
another 3 or 4 pounds to an even 50, to raise the 
other cereals another 3 or 4 pounds also to an 
even 50, the family must eat muffins or Indian 
puddings often enough to absorb the difference. 

Or eat cereals as usual and cut the purchase of 
flour in half, make up the difference by eating 
potatoes. Folks who rely on potatoes instead of 
white bread are a long way from starvation. 

Those are two out of two million possible com- 
binations. 

THIS WE MUST DO 

This is no if-you-please affair. We have to. 
Unless we do this we are done for. We shall 
whether we like it or not. Every good American 
will shape his habits to the fifty-fifty rule because 
he is a good American. Any other sort will take 
the fifty-fifty rations because that is all he will get. 

There w^ill be no famine. The Government, 
which has absolute control of exports, will not let 



the land go hungry. We could not send that much 
food abroad if we tried — there are not ships 
enough. 

We may have to get along with less wheat in 
our bread — and we can. We may have to get 
along with less bread in our diet — and we can. 
To-day the rule is fifty-fifty ; next month it may 
be sixty and forty. If we drew down the propor- 
tion of wheat to one in ten we would still be w^ell 
nourished. Though there is no sign of that ex- 
tremity, we shall certainly depend more and more 
on our reserves of other food to maintain the flow 
of necessary foodstuffs to Europe. Unless we do 
that we are done for. 



All that we have belongs to the Nation — 
A Nation that sets its face against privilege, 
A Nation that despises profit from war, 
A Nation that believes in equality of burden, 
A Nation committed to universal service, 
A Nation living by the rule of equal sacrifice. 

The fifty-fifty rule treats everyone alike. 



THE WHEAT SITUATION 

UNITED STATES FOOD ADMINISTRATION 

Every aspect of the wheat situation, both present and prospective, intensi- 
fies the need for the greatest possible limitation in the American consumption of 
wheat and wheat products. If present restrictions should be in the slightest degree 
relaxed it would result in serious want for the people of Europe before the new 
crop can reach the market. 

The Food Administration's estimate of the position on the first of June in- 
dicates a total available supply until the new harvest, including the grain which 
will be available from the farms, in country and terminal elevators, and mill ele- 
vators, of about 56,000,000 bushels. Of this 30,000,000 bushels must be ex- 
ported before new wheat is available for export if we are to maintain the absolutely 
necessary shipments to our Army and the Allies. That leaves about 26,000,000 
bushels for domestic consumption for the next two months. 

Normal American consumption is something over 40,000,000 bushels a 
month, so that the most liberal consumption at home would be only one-third of 
normal. 

In addition to the wheat on the farms and in elevators there is always an 
indeterminate further amount in transit and in dealers' hands, and this can never 
be reckoned in with the flour available for use for export and at home. As a mat- 
ter of fact, this stock is not actually available, since these supplies must remain 
constantly in flow; they remain a permanent stock, the removal of w^hich w^ould 
later cause a period of acute shortage in distribution before new wheat would be 
available. There is further an inclination to include new crop prospects with pres- 
ent conditions, which has led to confusion. The harvest will not be generally avail- 
able in flour until the middle of August or early September, although in the extreme 
South it will be somewhat earlier. At a meeting of the Federal Food Adminis- 
tration in Washington yesterday, representing all 48 States, it was the unanimous 



S-14 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— SUPPLEMENT 

view that even if the harvest does prove abundant it will be the first duty of the 
American people to place e^'ery grain they can save into storage against possible 
bad years ahead. In consequence there should be no anticipation of unlimited 
wheat bread until the war is over. 

Some of the most inconvenient restrictions can no doubt be modified with 
the arrival of a large harvest, but if we are honest with ourselves we will maintain 
restrictions requiring the use of some substitutes, both domestic and commercial; 
we will continue the requirement of high milling extraction and the elimination of 
the non-essential use of and w^aste of flour and bread. 

It is worth remembering that the famine in Egypt eight thousand years 
ago was saved by a little governmental foresight, and it does not require any 
illuminating dream to anticipate that so long as the war lasts, with its increasing 
drafts for soldiers and munition workers, the world will steadily produce less food. 
If we are wise, a great harvest will mean the willing building up of great national 
reserves. 



CHOOSE YOUR FOOD WISELY 

(United States Food Leaflet No. 4) 

STUDY THESE FIVE FOOD GROUPS 

Every food you eat may be put into one of these groups. Each group 
serves a special purpose in nourishing your body. You should choose some food 
from each group daily. 

1 . VEGETABLES AND FRUITS. 

2. MILK, EGGS, FISH, MEAT, CHEESE, BEANS, PEAS, PEA- 

NUTS. 

3. CEREALS— CORN MEAL, OATMEAL, RICE, BREAD, ETC. 

4. SUGAR, SYRUPS, JELLY, HONEY, ETC. 

5. FATS— BUTTER, MARGARINE, COTTONSEED OIL, OLIVE 

OIL, DRIPPINGS, SUET. 

You can exchange one food for another in the same group. For example, 
oatmeal may be used instead of wheat, and eggs, or sometimes beans, instead of 
meat ; but oatmeal cannot be used instead of milk. Use both oatmeal and milk. 

The sugar group, while very useful to the body, is not so necessary as the 
others to keep us in health. It helps make our food taste good, how^ever. 

It is interesting to count up how much of each group you use daily. Here 
are the amounts that a man doing moderate work could well use. A woman, be- 
ing smaller, would use about four-fifths the amount, and children still less, but be 
sure that each child has at least a pint, or better, a quart of milk each day.

REMEMBER THE FIVE GROUPS 

Fruits and Vegetables furnish some of the material from which the body is 
made and keep its many parts working smoothly. They help prevent constipa- 
tion w^hich gives you headaches and makes you stupid. The kinds you choose 
depend upon the season, but remember that the cheaper ones are often as valu- 
able as the more expensive. 

Milk, Eggs, Fish, Meat, Peas, Beans — These help build up the growing 
body and renew^ used-up parts. That is their main business. Dried peas and beans 
make good dishes to use in place of meat part of the time, but don't leave out the 
other foods entirely. Milk is the most important. Buy at least a pint a day for 
every member of your family. No other food can take its place for children. Save 
on meat if you must, but don't skimp on milk. 

Cereals — Bread and breakfast foods. These foods act as fuel to let you do 
your work, much as the gasoline burning in an automobile engine makes the car 
go. This you can think of as their chief business. And they are usually your 
cheapest fuel. Besides, they give your body some building material. 

Don't think that wheat bread is the only kind of cereal food. The Gov- 
ernment asks us to save wheat to send abroad to our soldiers and the Allies. Let 
the North try the Southern corn bread and the South the oatmeal of the North. 
Half the fun in cooking is in trying new things. An oatmeal pudding is delicious. 
See Leaflet No. 6 for the recipe. 

Sugar and Syrups are fuel, too, and they give flavor to other foods. They 
are valuable food, but many people eat more of them than they need. Sweet fruits, 
of course, contain much sugar and are better for the children than candy. 

Fat is fuel — Some is needed especially by hard-working people. Remem- 
ber that expensive fats are no better fuel than cheap ones. Use drippings. Don't 
let your butcher keep the trimmings from your meat. They belong to you. Chil- 
dren need some butter fat. Give it to them in plenty of whole milk or in butter. 



HOUSEHOLD CONSERVATION— FOOD 

(Iowa State College of Agriculture) 

GUARD THE FOOD SUPPLY 

Food is now the world's greatest need. The fields of Europe are devas- 
tated, crops are short in the southern hemisphere and some of our own farmers 
must enlist for military service. Our food reserves are limited and we must not 
only feed our soldiers at the front but also the army that remains at home to fight 
for the worlds sustenance. 

We must keep only what we need and send all we can spare to help feed our 
hungry neighbors. 

A slice of bread saved every day seems a mere trifle, but it means two dozen 
loaves of bread in a year. Will you save the trifle? 



SAVE FOOD IN THE FOLLOWING WAYS 

By careful buying. 
By careful storing and handling. 
By proper cooking and serving. 
By sane eating. 
By eliminating waste. 

By substituting cheaper foods for more expen- 
sive. 

FOOD MONEY IS WASTED 

By ordering by telephone. 

By ordering indefinitely, by price rather than by 
weight. 

By buying perishable foods in too large quan- 
tities. 

By buying "out of season" foods (straw^berries 
in December). 

By buying ready to eat foods (breakfast foods, 
canned soups). 

By buying foods high in price, and low^ in food 
value (asparagus tips, oysters, pimentos and mush- 
rooms). 

By "living out of paper bags." 

By buying staple foods in small packages (corn- 
meal, rice). 

By buying for wants rather than for needs. 

BREADSTUFFS ARE WASTED 

By careless storing of cereals (flour, meal, ad- 
mitting insects). 

By leaving flour and dough adhering to bread 
bow^l and board. 

By bread failures due to wrong handling and 
baking. 

By discarding left overs, biscuits, muffins, ends 
of loaves. (^Bread crumbs may be used in numer- 
ous ways.) 

By underbaking, resulting in souring when few 
days old. 

By improper storing of bread, resulting in sour- 
ing and molding. 



MEATS ARE WASTED 

By careless storing. 

By leaving trimmings at market — fat and bones. 

By discarding excess fat — all fat is usable. 

By discarding bones — useful in soups. (Remove 
surplus fat and bone before cooking.) 

By wrong cooking. 

By discarding left overs. 

By discarding juices and broths. 

By providing too much in the diet. 

By overeating on part of individuals. (One 
meatless day each w^eek will help to conserve the 
supply of meat and to improve health.) 

VEGETABLES ARE WASTED 

By careless storing. 

By taking thick parings, sometimes 20 per cent, 
of edible portion. Save food by cooking in jackets. 

By discarding small-sized vegetables. 

By discarding water in which vegetables are 
cooked. Steaming saves food material. 

By discarding leaves and stem (beet tops, turnip 
tops, outer stalks and leaves of celery) . 

By overcooking. 

By undercooking 

By cooking larger quantity than is needed. 

By discarding left overs. 

MILK IS WASTED 

By careless handling. 

By discarding buttermilk (use for cookery and 
beverages). 

By discarding separated milk (use for cheese 
and cookery). 

By discarding skim milk (use for cheese and 
cookery). 

By discarding sour milk (use for cheese and 
cookery). 

By discarding whey (use in bread making). 



S-16 



SUPPLEMENT— HOUSEHOLD CONSERVATION— FOOD 



S-17 



FUEL IS WASTED 

By cooking a few dishes at a time. (Heat cook 
stove less often and cook more dishes at a time. 
Have oven full of baking.) 

By turning gas or kerosene flame higher than 
necessary. (No time is saved by boiling the kettle 
over.) 

By leaving gas turned on to save re-lighting. 

By the use of poor stoves — ovens particularly. 
(Much fuel may be saved by the use of the fireless 
cooker.) 

SOME EXPENSIVE MISTAKES IN SERVING 
In the Home 

Too large quantities placed on individual plates. 

The same amounts served to each, regardless 
of appetite. 

The same foods served to each, regardless of 
taste. 

Elaborate menus for entertaining. 

In Boarding House, Restaurant and Hotel 

Same foods served to each individual; no choice 
offered. 

Same-sized portions served to all alike (choice 
of half portions should be offered). 

Too great a variety offered at each meal (means 
greater waste). 

At School Functions 

Menus much too elaborate. (Simpler menu 
serves purpose of sociability and saves food.) 

SOME EXPENSIVE MISTAKES IN EATING 

By eating more than is needed. 

By eating foods in wrong proportions. 

By eating too rapidly; less food is required if 
eaten slowly and chewed thoroughly. 

By serving one's self more food that is wanted 
(butter, bread, etc.). 



By eating crusts and discarding soft portion, and 
vice versa. 

By placing excess of sugar in tea and coffee. 
(Undissolved sugar in cup is Mrasted.) 

SOME WAYS OF REDUCING FOOD EXPENSE 

Use MILK in all forms and in all possible ways. 
Buttermilk and separated milk have good food 
value. 

Use corn products — meal, grits and hominy. 
These should be used largely to save wheat prod- 
ucts. 

Use oatmeal and rice. Broken rice costs less 
than the whole rice. 

Use more of the cheaper vegetables, as "greens," 
carrots, turnips, parsnips, and rutabagas. Such 
vegetables are necessary when substituting rice 
and corn products for potatoes. 

Use some dried fruits apples, peaches, apricots, 

prunes, raisins, or figs. 

Use cheaper cuts of meat. Bacon ends are sold 
at reduction. 

Use some nuts instead of meat. Peanuts are 
cheapest. 

Use some cheese instead of meat. There is less 
waste in cheese. 

Use some dried fish and salt fish. 

Use less tea and coffee. 

Pay cash. 

Satisfy body needs rather than vagaries of appe- 
tite. 

FOOD PREJUDICES 

AH food material that is clean and wholesome 
is fit to be eaten. Overcome food prejudices, they 
are no more reasonable than other prejudices. 

FOOD EXHIBITS 

No perishable food exhibits should be held at 
fairs, farmers* institutes and other such meetings 
w^hile the shortage lasts. 



WHY WE MUST SEND WHEAT 

UNITED STATES FOOD ADMINISTRATION 

Supplying Wheat for the Armies and the Allies Is a Military Necessity and an Act 

of National Defense, the Redemption of a National Obligation 

to Which Our National Honor Is Pledged 

Washington, May, 1918 

The Allies ask America for wheat, rye, corn, barley, and oats, and we are 
sending them in large amounts. They ask us especially, however, for wheat. 
They ask it as the necessary basis for their necessary loaf. They must have bread, 
and they must have bread which will keep sweet and palatable for several days. 

Wheat is the basis for the durable raised bread loaf. 



S-18 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK-SUPPLEMENT 

Troops must have bread carried to the front from bakeries behind the lines; 
it must be a durable raised loaf. 

Workers in the war factories must have bread from commercial bakeries. 
The vv^omen in the factories cannot be bakers also. Their bread must be the dur- 
able raised loaf. 

All France depends on the bakeries for its bread. The people do not know 
how to bake in the home. They have no ovens for baking, nor could they afford 
fuel for them if they had. 

All the bread of France and England and Italy to-day is war bread. It is 
made of gray wheat flour, milled at a high extraction rate; that is, a larger pro- 
portion of the wheat grain is now put into the flour than formerly w^as the case. 
Their flour now contains more of the outer parts of the wheat grain, parts which 
formerly were separated from the flour and used as feed for animals. This flour is 
then mixed with as large a percentage — usually 25 per cent — of flour made from 
other cereals as can be used and still permit the making of the raised loaf. 

In England this war bread cannot be sold until it is 12 hours old, so that the 
people won't be tempted to eat too much fresh bread. In France and Italy the 
bread is rationed according to the age and occupation of each person. A child 
has less than an adult; a light worker less than one who does heavy labor. 

France has always lived on bread. Of the average Frenchman's normal diet 
52 per cent is composed of bread and but 48 per cent of other foods. France has 
just put her whole people on a rigorous bread ration, which limits them to only two- 
thirds of the amount they have been accustomed to. In all the Allied countries 
they are using as little wheat as will give them bread at all, and as little of this 
bread as is possible to keep them in health and strength. 

The people of Belgium are living on a relief ration. Over 1 ,000,000 of 
them get their daily bread and soup by standing in line long hours before the re- 
lief kitchens. They have stood in these long soup lines every day for three and 
one-half years. But they do not complain. They only ask that the soup and bread 
be there every day. They depend upon America. 

We are, as we have said, sending corn and other cereals to England, France, 
Italy and Belgium. These cereals are shipped as fast as they can be used. But the 
people cannot live on them alone. They do not know how. They are unable to cook 
them properly. They must have w^heat to mix with them and with potatoes to 
make their bread. We are now sending wheat to the limit of our cargo space, 
and yet w^e are only meeting the minimum requirements of these people. In order 
to continue doing this, our people must share their present wheat supply. 

We are dividing our wheat evenly to-day between ourselves and the Allies. 
We must not use before the next harves more than one-half of the wheat we have. 
Even with one-half of our wheat the loaf of the Allies is small. It cannot be 
made smaller without undermining their strength and morale. Is there any doubt 
what we shall do in this emergency? We have just one thing to do, and that is to 
save wheat and send wheat. 



SUPPLEMENT— WHY WE MUST SEND WHEAT S-19 

IS WHEAT INDISPENSABLE IN OUR DIET? 

The question naturally arises, however: To what extent can the wheat to 
which we are now accustomed in our diet be reduced without injury to the health 
of the individuals of the Nation? This question was put by the Food Administra- 
tion to a committee of experts recently assembled in Washington to consider the 
special physiological problems involved in the general problem of wheat conserva- 
tion. 

Dr. R. H. Chittenden, Professor of Physiological Chemistry and Dean of Sheffield Scientific 
School, Yale. 

Dr. Graham Lusk, Professor of Physiology, Cornell University. 

Dr. E. V. McCollum, Professor of Bio-Chemistry, Johns Hopkins University. 

Dr. L. B. Mendel, Professor of Physiological Chemistry, Yale University. 

C. L. Alsberg, Chief of the Bureau of Chemistry, U. S. Department of Agriculture. 

Dr. F. C. Langworthy, Chief, Home Economics Office, States Relations Service, U. S. Depart- 
ment of Agriculture. 

Dr. Alonzo E. Taylor, Professor of Physiological Chemistry, University of Pennsylvania. 

Prof. Vernon Kellogg, Stanford University. 

Dr. Raymond Pearl, School of Hygiene, Johns Hopkins University. 

Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur, formerly Dean of the Stanford ^University Medical School; now 
President of Stanford University. 

The committee, as may be seen, was composed of the highest physiological 
authorities in the country. Their answer to the question was direct and unequiv- 
ocal. 

It is the scientific opinion of the committee that in a mixed diet wheat may be entirely 
replaced, without harm, by other available cereals, namely, rice, barley, oats, and corn. 
However, we should not recommend this except as an emergency measure. 

The committee's particular reason for not recommending this, apart from 
the fact that wheat is perhaps the most convenient cereal for use because of its 
special qualities connected with the making of bread in loaves that will stand up 
and remain sweet and palatable for several days, is that going without wheat would 
be a psychological though not a physiological deprivation. We are accustomed as a 
nation, just as most of the nations of Europe are, to the use of wheat bread, and 
a sudden break in our custom would have for some people a psychological signifi- 
cance more or less disturbing. 

However, if these people could well understand the emergency leading to 
the change, and then could recognize that they are aiding their country in the 
great emergency by making the change, this psychological disturbance would be 
much reduced. 

Exactly this condition of a great national emergency, to meet which the 
loyal and patriotic efforts of all the people are needed, is the condition to-day. It 
is only because of this great national emergency that the Food Administration 
makes use of this deliberate judgment of the physiological experts called in for 
advice. 

Even under these circumstances, it is recognized that because of economic 
and commercial reasons, not all of the people of America can go without bread 
based on wheat, but it is certain that a great many people in this country can easily 
do so. It is the belief of the Food Administration that, for the sake of maintaining 
the wheat-bread supply for the armies and civilians of our fighting associates in 
the war, as well as our own soldiers in France, every patriotic American who can 
possibly do so will be glad to dispense entirely with wheat from now until the next 
harvest. 



WAR ECONOMY IN FOOD 

SUBSTITUTIONS IN THE PLANNING OF MEALS 
SUGGESTIONS and RECIPES 



HUMAN FOODSTUFFS COMPRISE THREE 
PRINCIPAL ELEMENTS 

Protein — Mainly present in meat, beans, hsn, 
poultry, milk, and to some extent in grains. 

Fats — That is, butter, cream, lard, bacon, mar- 
garine, cooking fats, beans, cottonseed oil, and 
other vegetable oils. 

Carbohydrates — Grains, sugar, potatoes and 
other vegetables. 

As a nation we eat and waste 80 per cent more 
protein than we require to maintain health. There- 
fore, we can reduce the amount of meat w^e eat 
without harm. 

We eat and waste 240 per cent more fat than 
is necessary. 

Of the carbohydrates we can just as well con- 
sume corn, oats and other cereals as w^heat, and 
we have abundant supplies of potatoes and vege- 
tables. 

Do not limit your supplies of milk and table 
butter, but consume it all. Don't waste any. 

You can reduce the consumption of fats by re- 
ducing pastry and fried foods. 

Remember the gospel of the clean plate, the 
serving of small portions, the purchase of less sup- 
plies. 

Hoarding — Any person in the United States who 
buys more foodstuffs than he customarily keeps at 
home in peace times is defeating the Food Admin- 
istration in its purpose to secure a just distribu- 
tion of food and in its great endeavors to reduce 
prices. The hoarding of food in households is not 
only unnecessary, as the Government is protecting 
the food supply of our people, but it is selfish and 
is a cause of high prices. 

Such actions, multiplied by thousands, increase 
the demands upon our railways for cars and al- 
ready, because of our military demands, it is w^ith 
extreme difficulty we can now move the vitally 
necessary food to markets. 

There is much insidious propaganda in the coun- 
try against conservation and increased production. 
All opposition to these services is direct assistance 
to the enemy. 

SUGGESTIONS FOR SUBSTITUTIONS IN PLAN- 
NING MEALS 

The question of planning meals grow^s daily more 
important, because it is more evident that food is 
to win or lose the war. 

The housewife is in an especially trying posi- 
tion. The needs of her family and the requests 
of the Food Administration seem at first glance at 



variance. The w^ord **save" has been over-empha- 
sized in the public mind and the w^ord "substitute" 
overlooked. A closer study reveals the fact that 
w^hat the Food Administration really wishes, and 
our Allies really need is that we restrict ourselves 
in the use of a few staples and encourage the wise 
use of many. From that viewpoint the housewife 
has left a large and varied supply of food from 
w^hich to select nourishment adapted to the w^ishes 
and needs of her family and to the condition of 
her pocketbook. 

LET US REMEMBER 

Let us remember that every flag that flies oppo- 
site the enemy's is by proxy the American flag, 
and that the armies fighting in our defense under 
these flags cannot be maintained through this 
w^inter unless there is food enough for them and 
for the women and children at home. There can 
be food enough only if America provides it. And 
America can provide it only by the personal serv- 
ice and patriotic co-operation of all of us.

Does this plan mean — 

1. The use of home grown products and thus 
allow the railroads to be hauling supplies for the 
army instead of food for my family?

If you have good recipes for bread of any kind 
make them conform to food conservation by omit- 
ting sugar and fat and by using substitutes in 
place of \vheat. Try recipes for yourself with your 
own substitutions. 

YEAST 

Because of the high price of yeast it may be 
economical w^hen bread is made frequently or in 
large quantities to prepare liquid yeast. In making 
the bread the amount of yeast used, of whatever 
kind, will depend upon the time in which the proc- 
ess is to be carried through. 

Liquid Yeast — Four medium-sized potatoes, 1 
quart hot water, I teaspoonful salt, I cake dry 
yeast, softened in '/4 cup of warm w^ater, or I 
cake compressed yeast, |/^ cup sugar. 

Wash pare and cook the potatoes in the water. 
Drain, mash and return to the w^ater. Make up to 
I quart. Add the sugar and salt and allow^ the 
mixture to cool. When lukewarm add the yeast. 
Keep at room temperature (65 to 70' F.) 
for 24 hours before using. If kept for a longer 
time it should be poured into a sterilized jar and 
put in a dark, cool place. 

Each of these recipes make one loaf. The 
weight of the different breads will vary from 18 
ounces to 23 ounces. 



WHEAT SAVING PROGRAM FOR THE 
HOUSEHOLD 

UNITED STATES FOOD ADMINISTRATION 
Washington, April, 1918 

We have got to reach the place — each one of us — where we define every 
decision in our lives as an act of War Policy. Everything that we do — plan — eat 
— wear — must be analyzed and measured from one single point of view^: Will it 
contribute to the carrying on of the war or will it contribute to its prolongation? 
There is no other thing in the world for us to do but to define everything in our 
lives as acts of military necessity or policy. 

The first necessity for us is to get a clear conception of the relation of 
wheat in the human diet and to divest ourselves of all preconceptions that are bred 
in us by generations of ease, indolence and luxury. 

WHEAT SAVING PROGRAM FOR THE HOUSEHOLD 

Until harvest the American people must reduce their consumption of wheat 
by one-half. 

The leading hotels of the country have pledged themselves to do without 
wheat until the pressure is eased. Many households are pledging themselves to 
the same measure of devotion to the national cause — no wheat until harvest. 

This is the "no-wheat" program: 

Use no breakfast cereal containing wheat. 

Use no wheat flour to "bind" cornmeal or other cereals in muffins or 

quick breads. 
Use barley flour, corn flour, or cornstarch for thickening soups and 

gravies — no wheat at all. 
Use no bread containing wheat flour. 
This is the "less-wheat" program: 

Use no breakfast cereal containing wheat. 

Use no wheat flour to "bind" cornmeal or other cereals in muffins or 

quick breads. 
Use no wheat flour for thickening soups or gravies. 
Use wheatless breads as far as possible, making exception where 

necessary for children, aged people, and invalids. 
If bread must be bought, use Victory bread, but as far as possible let 

potatoes, rice, hominy, or other cereals — not including wheat or 

rye — take the place of bread. 

WHEAT-SAVING SCHEDULES 

In those households where it is not possible to I. WITHIN THE ALLOWANCE 

give up wheat entirely, the choice lies between N^ ^Keat on wheatless meals and days, using 

cutting the use of wheat as far as possible below instead muffins, griddle cakes, and other hot breads 

11/2 pounds per person: or using the pound and a ^^i,h 100 per cent, substitutes, or using potatoes, 

half partly in bread and partly in other ways; or rice, and hominy instead of bread. That is, I 1 

using the pound and a half wholly in bread. meals in the week with no wheat.

THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— SUPPLEMENT 



Bread allowance: At the 10 remaining meals in 
the week allow tw^o I -ounce slices of Victory bread 
(equal to 20 ounces of bread) consuming I I I/2 
ounces of wheat flour. 

Other wheat products: Choose from the list 
showing w^heat flour in average servings of food 
those w^hich contain the least proportion of wheat 
flour, and serve those as seldom as may be. 

Omit entirely wheat products, such as wheat 
breakfast cereals, in which the proportion of w^heat 
is large. 

II. FULL ALLOWANCE WITH VARIETY 

The full allowance of wheat flour is 1 J/2 pounds 
per person per w^eek, including wheat flour in Vic- 
tory bread and all other wheat products in any

which uses one pound of ^vheat flour, leaving one- 
half pound a week of other wheat products, to be 
eaten as macaroni or breakfast food, or used in 
making pastry, cake, and incidental cooking. 

Victory bread must contain at least 25 per cent. 
of wheat substitutes, but the housewife can use 
50 per cent, successfully.

VICTORY BREADS 

This name may be given to any bread which contains at least 25 per cent* 
of some wheat flour substitute. Satisfactory and palatable yeast breads may be 
made containing 50 per cent substitutes. Whenever this can be increased it should 
be done. Since I 00 per cent substitutes may be used for quick breads, these should 
largely replace yeast breads while the shortage of wheat continues. 

In making bread such substitutes should be chosen as are most available in 
the particuler locality. If yeast bread is to be made, a bread recipe in common use, 
and the kind of yeast that is familiar, should be chosen. 

Each locality has different substitutes for wheat. At least part of the sub- 
stitutes used should be cereals that are easily available, though it is sometimes 
w^orth while to use one to help create a demand even though it cannot be had in 
abundance at the time. 

In general, wheat flour may be replaced by an equal weight of any substi- 
tute flour. The comparative weights of several such flours are given. 

COMPARATIVE WEIGHT AND MEASURE

RECIPES 



YEAST BREADS 

50% Wheat flour 1 

38% Wheat flour substitute by weight 
12% Potato (1 :4 basis) J 

From various experiments it was at first thought 
that in yeast breads not more than one-quarter of 
the wheat flour could be satisfactorily replaced by 
substitute flours without materially changing the 
lightness and palatability of the loaf. Work in the 
experimental kitchen of the Home Conservation 
Division of the Food Administration has shown 
that a 50'/( substitution may be made if the method 
is slightly modified, or perhaps a still greater one. 

1. Potato ils used as one-quarter of the substi- 

tute on the I to 4 basis (i. e. three-quarter 
of the weight of the potato is reckoned as 
water). 

2. A sponge is made of the substitute flour in- 

stead of the white flour. 

3. TTie dough is made much stifTer than ordin- 

ary bread dough. 
The recipe given will make an 1 8 to 19 oz. loaf. 



GROUND ROLLED OAT BREAD 

J/2 cup liquid 

J/2 cake compressed yeast 

^ cup (6 oz. ) mashed potato 

I tablespoon syrup 

1 teaspoon salt 

I teaspoon fat 

1 cup (454 oz.) ground oats 

1 J/2 cups (6 oz.) wheat flour 

Directions: Make a sponge of the liquid, yeast, 
syrup, mashed potato and enough of the ground 
oats to make a batter. Allow to rise until light 
(about one hour) and then add the salt, fat and 
remainder of the oats and the flour. The dough 
must be much stiffer than ordinary bread dough. 

Knead thoroughly and allow to rinse until double 
in bulk. Knead, mold into a loaf, and when double 
in bulk, bake 50 minutes to one hour. Begin in a 
moderately hot oven (400=" F.). After 15 to 20 
minutes, lower the temperature slightly (to 390*^ 
F. ) and finish baking.

WHEAT FOR LIBERTY 

UNITED STATES FOOD ADMINISTRATION 

The only question for every true-hearted American to-day is: "What can 
I do to help win the war?" The only answer — "Give instantly the service needed." 

"That service now is until the next harvest for you to share your wheat 
with your comrades across the sea — for you w^ho can afford it to give your whole 
share to them." 



WHEAT IS NOW A LUXURY FOR INVAUDS, BABIES AND THE 

VERY POOR 

It Is Not Now Fit Food for Strong Men and Women 
Autocracy compels, and gives no reasons. 
Democracy requests, and gives reasons. 
Are you ready for Democracy? 

The allied countries of Europe lack wheat because: Belgium, formerly 
strong, splendid and free, has America only to look to for daily bread; England 
formerly imported her wheat from South America and Australia as well as from 
North America; France and Italy have lost to the army the majority of their farm- 
ers; their women are needed in munition factories and in other civil occupations. 
Fertilizers and farming tools are lacking. 



SUPPLEMENT— WHEAT FOR LIBERTY 



S-27 



The allied countries of Europe need wheat because : Bread has been one of 
the chief sources of nourishment. Bakeries cannot make raised bread without 
wheat flour — French homes in particular depend on bakeries; fuel and time are 
lacking. One bakery can supply hundreds of families and so release hundreds of 
pounds of coal, hundreds of hours of time. If we insist upon eating wheat needed 
abroad. Liberty's armies and Liberty's civil population will collapse as Russia col- 
lapsed, because the food supplies of her armies and her civil population failed. 

Citizens of America, it is bad enough to have those countries across the 
seas bear the brunt of all the fighting. It is impossible to believe that with the facts 
before us, there is a living man or woman who will permit those countries to starve 
for us also. In old times the Prophets would have cursed the bread so eaten. It 
needs no Prophet now to say that there is a curse for anyone who in mere gratifica- 
tion of appetite eats wheaten bread, and that curse proclaims him a traitor to him- 
self and to his country. 

Enough has been said and written. The one who does not now understand 
the situation is an ignoramus or a slacker; the ignoramus can't and the slacker won't 
understand. The real pure-bred American from now on needs only the briefest 
message from one whom he trusts. 



BROTHER, YOUR COMRADES NEED WHEAT 

The Food Administrator for America has said, 
"My message is small and concrete, the service 
that we ask of you, that we ask of every well-to- 
do, every independent person in the United States 
to-day is that he shall abstain from the use of 
wheat in any form until the next harvest."

WHEATLESS BREADS AND CAKES 

UNITED STATES FOOD LEAFLET NO. 20 



SAVE THE WHEAT FOR VICTORY 

Our soldiers and those of the Allies who are 
fighting in France must have bread. America 
must send them wheat. Every American has a 
chance to help. We must use one-half or even 
less of the usual amount of wheat if our soldiers 
are to have the bread they need. 

To Save the Wheat Use the Wheat Substitutes. 
Corn meal, rolled oats, rice, and buckwheat — these 
are usually found everywhere. Besides you can 
now get barley flour, ground oats, corn flour, rice 
flour, and potato flour in many markets. In some 
places peanut flour, sweet potato meal, soy bean 
flour, kaftir, milo. and feterita meal can be ob- 
tained for use. Choose the ones easiest to get in 
your neighborhood and use them in place of wheat. 

Whole wheat and graham flour, macaroni, and 
the wheat breakfast foods should be saved just the 
same as white flour. We are also asked to save 
rye. 

Use Quick Breads. .American people have always 
used and liked quick breads. Try the wheat sub- 
stitutes for making them. They are delicious and 
they can save a great deal of wheat for our soldiers. 

Corn meal is one of the best of the wheat sub- 
stitutes. For its use see U. S. Food Leaflet No. 2. 

QUICK BREADS REQUIRING NO WHEAT 
Barley Biscuits 

Have you ever made barley biscuits? They are 
worth trying. 

2 cups barley flour; 2 tablespoons fat: Yi tea- 



spoon salt; 4 teaspoons baking powder; 2/3 cup 
milk. 

Sift the dry ingredients together, mix in the fat, 
and add the liquid until a soft dough is formed. 
Roll to about three-fourths inch thick, cut with a 
cooky cutter, and bake in a hot oven. 

This makes a very good dough for shortcake 
also. 

Buckwheat Breakfast Cake 

This is good, if served hot. 

2 cups buckwheat flour: '/4 cup shortening; 2 
cups sour milk: 1 teaspoon soda; J/2 teaspoon salt. 

Mix and bake in a flat pan so that the cake is 
about I 1/2 inches thick when done. Cut in squares 
and serve hot like corn bread. 

Waffles or Griddle Cakes 

I 1''2 cups milk; 2 eggs; 2 tablespoons fat; 2 cups 
barley flour; 3 teaspoons baking powder; I tea- 
spoon salt. 

Corn flour or half corn flour and half peanut 
flour may be used instead of barley flour. 

Sift the dry ingredients together and add slowly 
the milk, beaten egg yolk, and melted fat. Beat 
thoroughly for a minute and fold in stiffly beaten 
whites. Cook in hot well-greased waffle iron or 
as griddle cakes on a hot well-greased griddle. 

Oats are good for quick breads. Rolled oats 
may be ground through a food chopper and used in 
this form in quick breads or cakes, or ground oats 
may be bought as such.

Sift the dry ingredients together and add to the 
liquid. Stir in the melted fat. Bake in well- 
greased muffin molds for 23 minutes. 

For Scotch Oat Wafers see U. S. Food Leaflet 
No. 6. 

These quick breads must take the place of much 
of the yeast bread we are accustomed to using. 
The yeast bread w^e do use should be Victory bread. 
The bakers of this country are now making this 
Victory bread which contains 25 per cent, of wheat 
substitutes, just as the bakers in France and Eng- 
land are using wheat substitutes in their yeast 
bread. Waste none of the bread, for all products 
containing w^heat are precious. 

Loaf bread that can be sliced and served cold 
or toasted is often wanted. Try this conservation 
loaf. 

Oat and Corn-Flour Bread 

Two cups rolled oats (ground) ; 2/3 cup corn 
flour; 4 teaspoons baking powder; I teaspoon salt; 
^ cup milk; 2 eggs; 4 tablespoons corn syrup; 2 
tablespoons melted fat. 

Mix the melted fat, liquid, syrup and egg. Add 
the well-mixed dry ingredients. Bake as a loaf 
in a moderately hot oven for one hour or longer. 
Nuts or raisins may be added, if desired. 

Quick Breads for Americans. Victory bread 
saves wheat flour, but we can save more by making 
quick breads, which require no wheat. Let Amer- 
icans use them now for the Cause of Liberty. We 
cannot ask the women of France, many of whom 
are working twelve or fourteen hours a day in 
the field or factory, to make these breads. They 
are not accustomed to them and have no ovens 
in their homes for baking. Even in the little 
country towns they buy all their bread from the 
baker, and the bakeries are not equipped to make 
such breads. We cannot ask the men in the 
trenches to use the quick breads either, for all 



their bread must be baked by army bakers in the 
bakeries back of the lines. 

It is our duty to use quick breads here in Amer- 
ica, where we know how to make them and have 
facilities for baking them. Remember w^hen you 
take the extra trouble to make a quick bread for a 
meal you help to make it possible for the soldier 
in the trench or the French woman who is doing 
a man's work "over there" to have a loaf of bread. 

WHEATLESS CAKE AND PASTRY 

Very good cake and pastry can be made from 
the wheat substitutes. 

Pastry 

2 cups barley flour; 1/3 cup fat; 1 teaspoon salt; 
Water to make a stiff dough. 

Combine as for other pastry. 

Chocolate Cake 

This is a true conservation cake, for it saves 
sugar as well as wheat. 

|/^ cup fat; 3 tablespoons brown sugar; 2 eggs; 
I cup corn syrup; 2 squares chocolate (melted); 
Yl cup milk; 2 cups barley flour; 4 teaspoons bak- 
ing powder; '/4 teaspoon salt; I teaspoon vanilla. 

Cream the fat and sugar, add the egg yolks, 
syrup, and melted chocolate, and beat well. Sift 
the dry ingredients together and add alternately 
with the milk. Add vanilla and fold in the stiffly 
beaten whites. Bake in loaf or layers in a moder- 
ate oven. 

OTHER WAYS TO SAVE WHEAT 

Cut your loaf at the table slice by slice as needed. 
Waste not a crumb. 

Waste no flour on the bread board when you 
make bread. 

For thickening — Use cornstarch or the substi- 
tute flours. Fine corn meal is good for dredging 
meats. Every little bit of flour saved counts. 

Have breadless meals — Eat potatoes or cooked 
cereals to take the place of bread. When you have 
potatoes, rice, or honiiny served with meat, or for 
breakfast a large bowl of cereal, you do not need 
bread.

SAVE SUGAR 

UNITED STATES FOOD LEAFLET NO. 15 

USE OTHER SWEETS 

The Allies need sugar. The battle lines and enemy territory now include 
much of their sugar land, so that more and more they are turning to us and our 
sources of supply. We must give them what they need. 

To help them we must cut down our own consumption, otherwise there 
will not be enough sugar for us all. We, in the past, have used more than any 
other people. The French and Italians allow themselves only one-fourth pound a 
week. . We eat at least one pound — four times as much. 

To divide the world's sugar more evenly is a world problem that all of us 
can help solve. Let us do our part. We are asked merely to cut down our sugar 
from one pound to three-fourths of a pound. By this saving we can help win the 
war. 



HOW TO SAVE SUGAR 

Eat less sweet food. Put less sugar in tea and 
coffee and dissolve completely what you do use. 
Use less on cereals. Do not frost calces. Eat less 
candy. 

Instead of sugar use Cane, corn, and maple 

syrups, honey, molasses, and fruit syrups. To 
sweeten your cereals serve them with syrup or with 
sweet fruits. Use them to make delicious desserts 
— honey or corn syrup for a delicate flavor, and 
molasses or sorghum for a stronger one. Try 
molasses or syrup in Indian Pudding and Brown 
Pudding. (See Leaflets 2 and 6.) 

DATE PUDDING 

A sugarless pudding which uses both syrup 

and sweet fruit 

2 cups milk; '/2 cup corn or malpe syrup; 12 
seeded dates cut up small; 3 tablespoons corn- 
starch; Yz teaspoon salt; 1 teaspoon vanilla. 

Mix the cornstarch with Ya cup milk. Heat the 
remaining milk in a double boiler. Add the corn- 
starch, syrup, dates, and salt, and stir until thick, 
cover and cook for 20 minutes. Add the vanilla 
and pour into a dish to cool. Serves five people. 
Prunes are good instead of dates. 

GINGERBREAD 

Always liked and inexpensive 
I cup cornmeal; I cup wheat flour; 2 teaspoons 

cinnamon; 2 teaspoons ginger; Yl teaspoon salt; 

I teaspoon baking powder: I teaspoon baking soda; 

\ cup molasses; I cup sour milk or buttermilk; 2 

tablespoons fat. 

Sift the dry ingredients and add molasses, milk, 

and fat. Beat w^ell and pour into a greased pan. 

Bake 2 5 minutes. Notice that this recipe uses 

cornmeal for half the wheat flour ordinarily used. 



CAKE WITHOUT SUGAR 

An excellent cake, though not quite so sweet 

as with sugar 

Ya cup butter, oleomargarine or other fat; 2 cups 
corn syrup; 2 eggs; 3 cups flour; \Yl tablespoons 
baking powder; Ya teaspoon salt; 1 cup milk. 

Cream the shortening, add the syrup and the 
egg, and mix well. Add the niilk. Sift the baking 
powder and flour together, add it slow^ly to the 
mixture and beat. Bake in a moderate oven as a 
loaf or layer cake or small drop cakes. One- 
fourth cup of raisins added to the batter gives more 
flavor and sweetness. 

POPCORN 
A splendid substitute for sugar sweets 

Pop the dried corn in a regular popper or a 
covered iron frying pan, shaking vigorously and 
taking care not to let it burn. A cup of dried 
corn will make 3 quarts w^hen popped. It is good 
mixed with a little salt or melted butter and salt. 

To make a sw^eet of it, combine with syrup. Boil 
together I cup corn syrup and I tablespoon vinegar 
until a few^ drops harden in water. Pour over the 
popped corn while the syrup is hot. This amount 
of syrup w^ill cover 3 quarts of popped corn. As 
soon as the mass is cool enough to handle, grease 
the hands well and form into balls. 

STUFFED PRUNES AND DATES 
Delicious confections to use instead of candy 
Soak the prunes overnight, dry, and stuff with 
chopped nuts, raisins, or apricots. Wash the dates, 
dry them, and stuff the same as prunes. These 
and the Parisian Sweets are good to eat and good 
for you. 



S-32 



SUPPLEMENT— SAVE SUGAR 



S-33 



PARISIAN SWEETS 
Another sweet which is very good 

Use equal quantities of figs, dates and nuts. The 
nuts may be omitted and prunes or raisins added. 
Put through a food chopper. Mix well and roll 
in a little powdered sugar or grated cocoanut. 

FRUIT FOR DESSERT 

Raw, stewed, or baked fruits, dried or fresh, and 
dried sweet fruits like dates, figs, and raisins. By 
using fruit for dessert instead of rich pies and pud- 
dings you will conserve wheat flour and fats as 
well as sugar. Besides, the fruits are more whole- 
some and often less expensive. Bake or stew your 
fruit with corn syrup instead of sugar. The result 
is very good. For stewing use j/2 cup of syrup to 
1 'pound of fruit. When dried fruit is used, soak 
it first in water overnight and cook for i minutes. 

IS YOUR FAMILY SAVING ITS SHARE 
OF SUGAR? 
Plan saving for your household. Use no more 
than three-fourths pounds a week for each mem- 
ber. Multiply three-fourths pound by the number 
of people in your family and put that quantity 
aside for the week's use. That should include all 
the sugar you use in cookery and on the table. 
Eat less candy. Follow these suggestions and 
recipes and help the Allies in their great need.

USE SAVORY STEWS AND MEAT PIES 

Do you know how good they are? They may be so varied that you can 
have a different one every day in the week, and all of them delicious. It needs 
only a small piece of meat to give flavor to a hearty dish. 

Don't think that you must eat a lot of meat to be strong. Meat is good to 
help build up the body, but so are many other foods. 

In these dishes part of your building material comes from the more expen- 
sive meat and part from the cheaper peas, beans, hominy, and barley. The little 
meat with the vegetables and cereals will give the body what it needs. 



SAVORY STEWS 
Try them. They can be a whole meal and a 
nutritious one. These recipes serve five people. 
Here is an English stew that is especially good: 

HOT POT OF MUTTON AND BARLEY 

I pound mutton; Yi cup pearled barley; I table- 
spoon salt; 4 potatoes; 3 onions; Celery tops or 
other seasoning herbs. 



Cut the mutton in small pieces, and brown with 
the onion in fat cut from meat. This will help make 
the meat tender and improves the flavor. Pour 
this into a covered saucepan. Add 2 quarts water 
and the barley. Simmer for I Yi hours. Then add 
the potatoes cut in quarters, seasoning herbs, and 
seasoning, anci (ook one-half hour longer. 



S-34 



THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— SUPPLEMENT 



SAVORY STEWS AND MEAT PIES 
BEEF STEW 

I pound beef; 4 potatoes cut in quarters; '74 peck 
peas or I can; ! cup carrots cut up small; I tea- 
spoon salt. 

Cut the meat in small pieces and brown in the 
fat from the meat. Simmer in 2 quarts of water 
for I hour. Add the peas and carrots and cook, for 
one- half hour, then add the potatoes. If canned 
peas are used, add them 1 minutes before serving. 
Serve when potatoes are done. 

DIFFERENT STEWS 
Here is the way you can change the stews to 
make them different and to suit the season: 

1. The meat. This may be any kind and more 

or less than a pound may be used. Use the cheap 
cuts, the flank, rump, neck, or brisket. The long, 
slow cooking makes them tender. Game and 
poultry, are good. 

2. Potatoes and barley may be used or barley 
alone, or rice, hominy, or macaroni. 

3. Vegetables. — Carrots, turnips, onions, peas, 
beans, cabbage, tomatoes are good, canned or 
fresh. Use one or more of these, as you wish. 

4. Parsley, celery tops, onion tops, seasoning 
herbs, or chopped sweet peppers add to the flavor. 

5. Many left-overs may be used — not only meat 
and vegetables, but rice or hominy. 

HOW TO COOK THE STEWS 

All kinds of stews are cooked in just about the 
same way. Here are directions which will serve 
for making almost any kind. 

Cut the meat in small pieces and brown with 
the onion in the fat cut from the meat. Add the 
salt and pepper, seasoning vegetables (onion, celery 
tops, etc.), 2 quarts of water, and the rice, or 
other cereal, if it is to be used. Cook for an hour, 



then add the vegetables except potatoes. Cook 
the stew for half an hour, add the potatoes cut in 
quarters, cook for another half an hour, and serve. 

The fireless cooker may well be used, the meat 
and the vegetables being put in at the same time. 

Left-overs or canned vegetables need only to be 
heated through. Add them 1 5 minutes before 
serving. 

Dried peas or beans should be soaked over night 
and cooked for 3 hours before adding to the 
stew; or, better, cook them over night in a fireless 
cooker. 

THE BEST WAY TO MAKE A LITTLE MEAT 
GO A LONG WAY 

MEAT PIES 

Another good w^ay to use a little meat. Have 
you ever used rice, corn meal mush, or hominy for 
a crust? This is less work than a pastry crust and 
saves wheat. 

4 cups cooked corn meal, rice, or hominy; 1 
onion; 2 cups tomato; j/g teaspoon pepper; I table- 
spoon fat; I pound raw^ meat or left-over meat cut 
up small; |/2 teaspoon salt. 

Melt the fat, add the sliced onion, and, if raw 
meat is used, add it and stir until the red color 
disappears. Add the tomato and seasoning. If 
cooked meat is used, add it w^ith the tomato and 
seasoning, after the onion is browned, and heat 
through. Grease a baking dish, put in a layer of 
the cereal, add the meat and gravy, and cover with 
the cereal dotted with fat. Bake for half an hour. 

SHEPHERD'S PIE 

This is the name of a meat pie with a mashed- 
potato crust browned in the oven.

THE FISH SITUATION 

UNITED STATES FOOD ADMINISTRATION 

May 11, 1918. 

Extreme shortage in supplies of salt water fish on the Atlantic seaboard 
during the winter and early spring months has largely been remedied, the United 
States Food Administration has announced. The shortage has been due to the 
necessary taking over of trawlers for naval purposes and the recruiting of deep- 
sea fishermen by the Navy. The trawler production of deep-sea fish has now 
been materially increased by free admission of Canadian trawlers and new con- 
struction. Beyond this, certain State restrictions on littoral fishing have been 
Hfted. 

Supplies are being rapidly augmented. While the runs of migratory shore 
fish did not begin until late in the Fall and maximum catches of the different vari- 
eties was not felt until the latter part of May, wholesale prices quite generally are 
already down to relatively low levels, and should remain on this basis except when 
storms and climatic changes in the various districts bring about temporary short- 
ages. 

On every day in each week and continuously during the present season from May to December, 
some of the many varieties of salt water fish will be available and sold in the wholesale markets along 
the Atlantic Coast at prices ranging from four to six cents per pound. In view of these conditions, all 
retailers in the large cities along the Atlantic Coast and in the towns and cities of the interior, within 
reachable transportation distance from the Atlantic seaboard, will be able to sell every weekday at least 
one Variety of fish at a retail price to consumers of ten cents per pound or under. Any retail dealer 
who does not conform to these conditions and offer at least one kind of fish to the public at the max- 
imum retail price mentioned is not patriotically co-operating with the Food Administration and his cus- 
tomers. 

The particular variety sold by the retailer on this ten-cent basis must necessarily vary from day 
to day with the available supplies. Fish now available on the low^-priced basis include market cod, 
scrod cod, scrod haddock, haddock, medium hake, skate wings, gray fish, ling, flounders, shad herring, 
herring, whiting, croakers, butterfish (small), spotted trout (small), weakfish (small), small shad (known 
as jacks or skips), tinker mackerel, squid, small Boston mackerel, drum, menhaden, shark, sea robins, 
spots. Others will be added as the runs of the shore varieties strike on through the different Atlantic 
Coast districts in heavier volumes. 

The country was threatened with what amounted to a practical fish famine during the winter. 
The shortage arose fundamentally from the necessities of the Navy in requisitioning deep-sea trawlers 
and other fishing vessels and in recruiting fishermen for naval service. How important this has been 
may be seen from the fact that the trawler capacity supplying the New England districts was decreased 
last summer from an annual capacity of approximately sixty million pounds to thirty-five million pounds. 

A substantial number of new trawlers are now on the ways and approaching completion. Owing 
to the action of Secretary Redfield in opening up our fishing ports to Canadian vessels, several Canadian 
trawlers are now fishing to our markets. There is every prospect of acquiring trawlers from the Scandi- 
navian fisheries for use in this country. In the meantime, the relaxation of State regulations that have 
been effected by the Food Administration should tend to increase greatly the production of the shore 
fisheries, and its reflex will be steadily shown in the w^holesale prices of fish as the season progresses. 

With the approach of next winter, the Food Administration is confident the deep-sea fishing and 
the winter production of ground fish through the various sources indicated should be restored to normal.

WHEATLESS RECIPES 

UNITED STATES FOOD ADMINISTRATION 

Tested in the Experimental Kitchen of the Food Administration (Conservation 
Division) and the Department of Agriculture 

Washington, April, 1918. 

BAKING POWDER LOAF BREADS 
(Using no Wheat) 

All Measurements Are Level. — In the following recipes the weights given are accurate. The 
measurements are approximate; that is, they are given in the nearest fraction of a cup which a housew^ife 
ordinarily uses. It is convenient to remember in measuring unusual fractions that two level tablespoons 
are one-eighth cup. 

METHOD 

Mix the melted fat, liquid, syrup, and egg. Combine the liquid and w^ell mixed dry ingredients. 
Bake as a loaf in a moderately hot oven (205^ C. or 400 F.) for one hour or until thoroughly baked. 
Nuts, raisins, or dates may be added, making the breads more nutritious and very palatable.

1^ cups (5 ounces) barley flour. I J/2 cups (5 ounces) ground rolled oats. 

COMBINATION MUFFINS 

(Using no Wheat) 
METHOD OF MIXING 

Add to the cup of milk the melted fat, syrup, and slightly beaten egg; sift the salt, baking powder 
and f^our together. Use a coarse sieve so that no part of the flour is wasted. Combine the two mixtures, 
stirring lightly without beating. Bake in a hot oven (427 F. or 225- C.) for 20 to 30 minutes, de- 
pending upon the size of the muffins. 

These recipes make 24 small muffins (3 of which make a 2-ounce serving) or 8 very large muffins. 

The ground rolled oats are the same as roll::d oats ground in a food chopper. When using oats, 
mix them with the other sifted dry ingredients. 

When cornmeal is used, mix do not sift — the ingredients. 

Suggestions. — The wheat substitute recipes given below show that a wide variety of combinations 
is possible even w^hen limited to the use of a few substitutes. 

All of the combinations are good. In nearly all cases a combination of substitutes makes a better 
product than the use of only one substitute. 

Muffins containing oats have a particularly pleasant flavor. 

Other substitutes used with buckwheat will modify the color and improve the flavor of the product. 
The use of molasses will also do this.

1 teaspoon salt, 1 '/2 cups barley flour (4 ounces), 
I cup corn flour (4 ounces). 



BISCUIT 

(Using no Wheat) 
METHOD 

Sift dry materials together. Work in fat well. Combine liquid and dry materials, handling lightly. 
Roll or pat 1/2 inch thick and cut as biscuits. Bake in a hot oven. 

Use a coarse sifter or mix instead of sifting if the flours are coarse, so that none is wasted. 

Biscuits made of the substitutes are less like the normal wheat flour product, particularly in texture, 
than are the mufHns, loaf breads, and cakes. 

If one-fourth more liquid is used, a drop biscuit having better texture is the result.

USE BARLEY SAVE WHEAT 

UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE 
THE STATES RELATIONS SERVICE 



Washington, April 18, 1918. 

Barley is grown in large quantities in the United States and it is now being 
ground into flour, though until lately it was more generally used for other purposes. 
it is a palatable, wholesome grain which has long been used in infant feeding and, 
to some extent, for general cookery, and which can now be used in quantity to 
save wheat. You will find barley flour one of the best of the wheat substitutes. 
Delicious breads and cakes can be made by using it to replace all or part of the 
wheat flour. 

The use of barley flour for such purposes, though new to most of us, is 
not new to some people. Not many years ago barley was used more extensively 
than wheat for bread making in many of the European countries. Let us revive 
the art of barley cookery and, by so doing, "stretch** our supply of wheat flour so 
that it may go farther to meet the needs of our Allies. We can easily do this and 
at the same time serve our families with delicious bread, muffins, biscuit, and 
pastry. 



USE BARLEY— SAVE WHEAT 

Hundreds of millions of bushels of barley are 
raised yearly in the United States. This supply, 
heretofore, has been used chiefly for stock feed or 
for malting, but under present conditions the 
greater part of the crop is being milled into flour, 
which, since it is both palatable and nutritious, may 
well be used to meet the increasing demand for 
w^heat substitutes. This flour is now on the mar- 
ket, and it is our patriotic duty to use it to save 
the wheat flour. 

Give barley flour a trial — you will wonder why 
w^e did not use it more before the war. 

Barley flour does not keep so well as wheat 
flour, so it is best to buy it in small quantities, even 
for home consumption. 

The recipes w^hich follow have been tested in 
the experimental kitchen of the Office of Home 
Economics. 

Note — All measures are level. 

HOT BREADS 

Barley flour is very satisfactory for hot breads. 

BARLEY QUICK BISCUITS 
Tw^o cups barley flour, |/2 teaspoon salt, 2 table- 
spoons fat, 4 teaspoons baking powder, 2/3 cup 
milk. 

BARLEY DROP BISCUITS 

Two cups barley flour, Yl teaspoon salt, 4 table- 
spoons fat, 6 teaspoons baking powder, I cup milk. 

Baked in a sheet this makes a good shortcake 
buttered and served with fresh crushed berries or 
other fruit. 



BARLEY WAFFLES 

Two cups barley flour, 1 teaspoon salt, 3 tea- 
spoons baking powder, 1 Yl cups milk, 2 eggs, 3 
tablespoons melted fat. 

Sift the dry ingredients together and add slowly 
the milk, beaten egg yolk, and melted fat. Fold 
in stiffly beaten whites. Beat thoroughly and cook 
in hot, well-greased waffle irons. 

BARLEY MUFFINS 

Two and three-quarter cups barley flour, 1 cup 
milk, 2 tablespoons corn syrup, 4 teaspoons baking 
powder, 1 tablespoon fat, I egg, '/4 teaspoon salt. 

BARLEY SPOON BREAD 

One cup barley flour, I cup hot boiled hominy 
grits, 3 tablespoons fat, 1 teaspoon salt, 2 cups 
milk, 2 eggs, 2 teaspoons baking powder. 

BARLEY YEAST BREAD 

If you use you own bread recipe and replace 
one-fourth of the wheat flour with barley flour, 
you will be able to make a very good bread. With 
the present need of saving flour, it will be desirable 
for the housekeeper to make less yeast bread than 
usual, as one cannot use so large a percentage of 
wheat substitute in making yeast breads as in quick 
breads. 

BARLEY PASTRY 

Very good pie crust can be made with all-barley 
flour or by using one-half barley and one-half 
wheat flour. The first recipe is especially good 
for a one-crust pie. 



S.43

THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— SUPPLEMENT 



PIE CRUST 

One cup barley flour, 2 2/3 tablespoons fat, 
^ teaspoon salt, cold water. 

CAKES AND COOKIES 

It is not necessary to go without cake when 
such delicious products can be made that use no 
wheat flour and little sugar. In these recipes the 
housekeeper, if she prefers, can use cream of tartar 
with baking soda in the usual proportions in place 
of baking powder. 

CHOCOLATE CAKE 

Two cups barley flour, '/J cup fat, Ya teaspoon 
salt, 2 squares chocolate, Yi cup milk, 4 teaspoons 
baking powder, 3 tablespoons brown sugar, 1 cup 
corn syrup, 2 eggs, whites and yolks, beaten separ- 
ately, I teaspoon vanilla. 

SPONGE CAKE 

One and one-half cups barley flour, 4 eggs, 1 
tablespoon lemon juice, I Yl cups corn syrup, Ya 
teaspoon salt, 2 teaspoons baking powder. 

FRUIT CAKE 

Two and one-quarter cups barley flour, '/t cup 



fat, 3 tablespoons molasses, Yl cup chopped raisins, 
Ya teaspoon cinnamon, Yl cup chopped nuts, Yl 
cup corn syrup, Ya teaspoon soda, 1 teaspoon bak- 
ing powder, Ya teaspoon allspice, Ya teaspoon 
cloves, J/g cup citron. 

Bake 1 hour and 1 minutes. Keep moist and 
very good. 

GINGERBREAD 

One and one-half cups barley flour, Yl cup 
molasses, Yl cup milk, 2 teaspoons baking powder, 
Ya teaspoon soda, i teaspoon ginger, I teaspoon 
cinnamon, '/'g teaspoon salt, 2 tablespoons fat. 

Bake about 30 minutes in moderate oven. Good 
texture and flavor. 

HERMITS 

Two cups barley flour, 2 tablespoons fat, I egg, 
Yl teaspoon ginger, Ya cup chopped raisins, 1 tea- 
spoon baking powder, Yl cup corn syrup, Y4 tea- 
spoon salt, Yl teaspoon cinnamon, Ya cup nuts, 
I tablespoon milk. 

Honey, maple sugar, or maple, beet, apple, or 
sorghum syrup, which can be made at home, can 
be used in the same way as corn syrup in the 
above recipes to save sugar. 



SUGAR SAVING 



Because of the present shortage of sugar it is 
necessary for each person to reduce his consump- 
tion of sugar to % pound per week. There are 
so many sweet foods that may be used in place of 
sugar that this should be no hardship. 

Cut out candy. 

Use less sugar in tea and coffee and substitute 
other sweetening w^herever possible. 

Try cooking breakfast cereals with chopped figs, 
dates or raisins. You will not need to add any 
sugar at the table. 

Use molasses, honey, corn or other syrups for 
sw^eetening. 

*Apple syrup and concentrated cider. 

Get Government pamphlet giving directions for 
making syrup from apples and other fruits. Try 
some of these. 

Use fresh fruits for desserts in place of rich pas- 
tries and sw^eet puddings. 

Bake apples or pears w^ith a little water for sev- 
eral hours until a rich syrup forms. 

If more sweetening is desired add a little honey 



or molasses. 

Stew dried prunes in the w^ater in w^hich they 
were soaked until the liquid is almost all boiled 
away. If more juice is wanted add water to the 
syrup. The long, slow^ cooking is necessary to 
develop a rich flavor. 

Cut down the use of cake. 

Do not use frosting unless you can make it with- 
out sugar. 

Either honey or maple syrup can be substituted 
for sugar in a boiled frosting. 

When cake is made it should be not only wheat- 
saving, but sugar-saving and fat-saving. Try mak- 
ing cakes in which cornmeal, corn flour, rye flour, 
potato flour, rice flour or cornstarch is substituted 
for part of the w^heat flour. 

Use corn syrup, molasses, honey and other 
syrups for part or all of the sugar. 

A good working rule in making such substitution 
is to use 1 cupful of syrup as equivalent to 1 cup- 
ful of sugar and ^ cup of liquid. Corn syrup 
does not sweeten as much as molasses or honey. 



CONSERVATION 

CORNMEAL CRUST 

Grease a pie plate well. Cover with raw^ corn- 
meal, giving the plate a rotating motion so that 
an even layer of the meal will stick to the plate 
about 1/16 of an inch in thickness. Fill the plate 
with pumpkin pie mixture. Bake in a hot oven.

PIE CRUSTS 

OATMEAL CRUST 

Two cupfuls finely ground oatmeal, 1 cupful 
boiling Vi'ater, I teaspoonful fat. 

Scald the oatmeal w^ith the w^ater. Add fat and 
mix thoroughly. Roll very thin and line small pie 
or tart tins with the mixture. Bake in a hot oven. 
Fill with apricot marmalade or other thick mixture. 
If desired, spread a meringue on top and brown

Bake in moderate oven. 

Variation 
Two cupfuls of buckwheat flour may be substi- 
tuted for the cornmeal and flour in the above re- 
cipe. This will have the characteristic flavor of 
buckwheat. If it is too strong use only I cupful 
of buckwheat and I j/^ cupfuls of white flour. Two 
and a half cupfuls of rye flour may also be substi- 
tuted. 



*Omitted if desired. 



MEAT SAVING 



Meat saving is to be accomplished in various 
ways: 

1 . By doing without pork and beef. 

2 . By using meat less frequently. 

3. By serving smaller portions. 

4. By using meat extenders, such as a dish of 
rice, tomatoes and a little meat. 

5. By using substitutes, such as cheese, eggs, 
fish, game, poultry, dried beans and peas. 

MEAT EXTENDERS 
T AM ALE PIE (Serves 6) 

Two cupfuls cornmeal, 2 J/2 teaspoonfuls salt, 
6 cupfuls boiling water, I onion, 1 tablespoonful 
fat, I pound Hamburger steak, 2 cupfuls toma- 
toes, J/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper or I small 
chopped sweet pepper, I teaspoonful salt. 

Make a mush by stirring the cornmeal and I J/2 
teaspoonfuls salt into boiling water. Cook in a 
double boiler or over water for 45 minutes. Brown 
th» onion in the fat, add the Hamburger steak and 
stir until the red color disappears. Add the to- 
mato, pepper and salt. Grease a baking dish, put 
in a layer of cornmeal mush, add the seasoned 
meat, and cover with mush. Bake 30 minutes. 



BEEF STEW 

One pound beef, 4 potatoes cut in quarters, J/^ 
peck green peas or I can, I cupful carrots cut up 
small, 1 teaspoonful salt. 

Cut meat in small pieces and bro%vn in the fat 
from the meat. Simmer in 2 quarts of >vater for 
I hour. Add the peas and carrots and cook for 
half an hour, then add the potatoes. If canned 
peas are used, add them 1 minutes before serv- 
ing. Serve when potatoes are done. 

Variations 

1 . The Meat — This may be any kind and more 
or less than a pound ntay be used. Use the cheap 
cuts, the flank, rump, neck or brisket. The long, 
slow cooking makes them tender. Game and poul- 
try are good. 

2. Potatoes and barley may be used or barley 
alone, or rice, hominy or macaroni. 

3. Vegetables — Carrots, turnips, onions, peas, 
beans, cabbage, tomatoes are good, canned or 
fresh. Use one or more of these, as you wsh. 

4. Parsley, celery tops, onion tops, seasoning 
herbs, or chopped s\veet peppers add to the flavor, 

5. Many left-overs may be used — not only meat 
and vegetables, but rice and hominy.

SUBSTITUTES 



FISH CHOWDER 

A 3-pound fish, 4 tablespoonfuls drippings, 1 
medium-sized onion chopped fine, 1 quart sHced 
potatoes, 3 cups hot milk. 

Skin and bone the fish, and cut into inch cubes. 
Cover the bone and trimmings with cold water and 
let simmer for half an hour. Cook the onion in 
the fat for 5 minutes, then pour into a stew pan. 

Parboil the sliced potatoes for 5 minutes, then 
drain and add layers of fish and potatoes to the 
fat and onion in the stew pan. Season each layer 
^vith salt and pepper. 

Strain the liquor in which the fish bones have 
been cooking over all, and cook about 20 minutes

water (usually three times is sufficient). Then 
simmer until tender. Drain off the water. Mix 
the potatoes with the milk, eggs, fat and season- 
ing. Add the fish, turn into a greased baking dish 
and bake half an hour. 

BROILED SALT MACKEREL 

Freshen the fish by soaking I or 12 hours with 
the skin side up. Change the water several times. 
Simmer until tender (15 or 20 minutes) in water 
to which 1 teaspoonful of vinegar, a bay leaf, I 
slice of onion and a sprig of parsley have been 
added. Drain, rub the fish with a little salt and 
margarine or other fat. Grease the hot broiler and 
lay the fish on it. Brown on both sides quickly. 
Garnish with slices of lemon and parsley. 

JELLIED FISH

pings or vegetable oils. 

Mix the cheese, ground nuts, crumbs, lemon 
juice, salt and pepper. Cook the onion in the fat 
and a little water until tender. Add to the first 
mixture the onion and sufficient water or meat 
stock to moisten. Mix well, pour into a baking 
dish and brown in the oven. 

Variations 

Two cupfuls of cooked oatmeal may be substi- 
tuted for the cheese and the bread crumbs. 

One pound of beans, cooked and put through a 
sieve may be substituted for the nuts. 

American cheese, grated or cut fine, may be 
used in place of cottage cheese. 

The amount of liquid added will vary in each 
case. The seasoning may be varied to suit the 
case. 

SAUCES 

Especial attention must be given to seasoning 
of dishes which have as their foundation beans, 
rice or other foods having little flavor of their 
own. 

Use peppers, onions, garlic, leek, celery, catsup, 
Worcestershire sauce, etc., for increasing flavor. 
Bean and nut loaves should be served with highly 
seasoned sauces.

ITALIAN TOMATO SAUCE 

Two cupfuls cooked tomatoes, |/2 cup finely 
cut onion, [/2 cup grated or cut turnip, ^/i cup 
grated or cut carrot, 2 teaspoonfuls salt, I cup 
cut green peppers, 4 tablespoonfuls butter substi- 
tute or vegetable drippings, 2 tablespoonfuls rice 
floior. 

Cook vegetables (except tomato) in the fat un- 
til tender. Add tomato and salt, cook 5 minutes. 
Put through strainer, return to fire, add flour 
mixed with 2 tablespoonfuls cold water, boil 5 
minutes. 

PIMENTO SAUCE 

Force canned pimento through a strainer. Add 
j/2 cup of this puree to 1 cupful of white sauce. 

BROWN NUT SAUCE 

Two tablespoonfuls drippings or vegetable oil, 
2 tablespoonfuls peanut butter, 3^/2 tablespoonfuls 
flour, I J/^ cupfuls meat or vegetable stock or milk, 
!/2 teaspoon salt, few grains of pepper. 

Brown the fat, add peanut butter, and when well 
mixed add flour and continue browning. Pour in 
the stock gradually, stirring constantly. Bring to 
the boiling point and add salt and pepper. 



FAT SAVING 

We use twice as much fat as some of our Allies. 

The amount used here should be not more than 
f^ pound per person per week and 6 ounces for 
children under ten. 

Butter may be used freely on the table. 

Peanut butter, jellies, or a nut and fig paste are 
excellent substitutes. 

Use little pastry. 

When you do make pies, use one crust instead 
of two. 

Try the New England deep apple pie, with only 
a top crust. 

Vegetable fats may be used in making the 
pastry. 

If vegetable oils are used, the quantity of fat 
may be reduced by one-third; that is, 2^4 table- 
spoonfuls of oil to 1 cupful of flour is sufficient. 
The oil itself helps to moisten the flour, so that 
very little water is necessary. The dough should 
be made as dry as possible to make a tender pas- 
try. 

Do not fry in deep fat. 

Bake croquettes in the oven. 

Make meat-loaf instead of meat croquettes. 

Either do not use recipes calling for a large 
quantity of fat or try reducing the amount.

PRINCIPLE OF SUBSTITUTING 

The recipes which have been worked out on 
the principle that a given weight of wheat flour 
may be replaced by an equal weight of substitute 
have been repeated a number of times by the 
laboratory workers in the experimental laboratory 
kitchen, and have also been tried out by a number 
of different people — housekeepers, children in 
cooking schools and others ^vho have found that 



( ) Indicates a scant measure. 

WEIGHT FOR WEIGHT 

they worked very satisfactorily. There is no ques- 
tion that the weight for weight substitution pro- 
duces good results; this does not mean that other 
methods of substitution may not be satisfactory. 
Some of the flours in equal weights may absorb 
more water than others; but whatever other pro- 
portions work, these certainly have been proved. 



BASIS FOR PRESENT STANDARD 

The measures have been calculated on the basis 
of repeated weighings in the experimental kitchen 
in co-operation with the Office of Home Economics 
of the Department of Agriculture, using the flours 
available on the local market. It has been found 
that samples bought at different times have often 
been of different weights. The rolled oats has been 
a good example. The first purchased was ground 
and weighed 136 grams per cup — the last which 
%ve ground ourselves weighed 98 grams per cup. 

In different parts of the country, also, the 
weights of these flours seem to differ. Requests 
have been sent to a number of co-operating Home 



OF WEIGHTS AND MEASURES 

Economics Departments asking for a report of the 
weight of a standard cup of the materials used in 
their laboratories. When this data has been re- 
ceived and studied some different figures may be 
adopted to represent a general average. 

For the present, we have adopted the modica- 
tion of weights and measures given in the accom- 
panying table, which will be used hereafter in order 
to avoid any confusion or inconsistency. For the 
benefit of those working with them, plus and minus 
signs are used to show that the measures are not 
exact; 8/9 of a cup, for instance, must be trans- 
lated either into I cup or 7/8 of a cup, and the 



S-49 



S-50 



THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— SUPPLEMENT 



sign shows which has been done. There is, how^- 
ever, so much variation in the size of the measur- 
ing cup, and also so much difference in the ways 
of measuring, that there is no greater error in this 
translation from one fraction to another than is 
bound to occur in any use of measures. 



It must be remembered that measures are not 
accurate, and that more uniform results may be 
secured by weighing. 

These recipes have been submitted as a report 
of progress and to fill the immediate need rather 
than as final statements. 



WEIGHTS AND MEASURES COMPARED 



Yet another method of studying food values is 
to be found in a consideration of weight, cost and 
measure. This has been used by w^ise housekeep- 
ers for some time, but some w^omen have been so 
impressed with the importance of buying by vireight 
that they have almost lost sight of the expression 
of this w^eight in terms of measure. Such a com- 
mon commodity as potatoes, of course, is often 
purchased by weight, but it is very important 
to realize that there are 1 5 pounds of potatoes 
in a peck, and that this same I 5 pounds also 
represents about 50 medium-sized potatoes. In 
other w^ords, if a housekeeper buys a pound of 
potatoes, she will get three medium-sized potatoes 
and a little one thrown in for full weight. A pound 
of prunes may be ordered without any special 
interest by the woman buyer, and she may get 
either large or small prunes, depending upon the 
grocer's wishes, while a wise buyer would stipu- 
late the size wanted, because she would know that 
in a pound of small prunes she w^ould get about 40 
prunes, while if they were large there would be 
about 28. 



The following table shows the relation of weight 
and measure, and also brings about the difference 
in the weight of contents of the cans of different 
sizes. In the case of canned pork and beans, the 
No. I can, cost 1 5 cents, weighs 1 1 ounces, w^hile 
the No. 2 can, cost 20 cents, w^eighs 21 ounces. 
In the latter can. the cost of the additional 1 
ounces is 5 cents. If the housekeeper uses con- 
densed milk in quantity, it is better for her to buy 
the I 6-ounce can, as the cost per ounce is much 
less than if she purchases the 6-ounce can. Of 
course, it may be better economy for the w^oman 
to buy the No. 2 can of vegetables, but this is true 
only when the No. 2 can gives her exactly enough 
for one meal for her family. If there is a serving 
left over, it is evidently wiser for her to buy the 
No. 3 can, because then she has enough for tw^o 
meals, and, with different methods of preparation, 
w^ill run no risk of monotony. 

It seems clear, then, that several elements enter 
into the wise buying of food. One who enlists in 
that service ought to have a clear conception of 
the relation of these units of w^eights, cost and 
measures.

HOME AND CLUB STUDY 
ON FOOD CONSERVATION 

The U. S. Food Administration published, during 1917, a booklet, entitled: 

TEN LESSONS ON FOOD CONSERVATION 
Arranged for School and Club Study 

The booklet is now out of print; but a special edition vs^as run off for 
Libraries, and a copy is on file in every public library, at the present time, available 
for reference use. 

The Food Administration has since published a new booklet (June, 1918), 
entitled : 

NINE LESSONS ON "FOOD IN WAR AND PEACE" 

Arranged for Home Study and for School and Club Use 

This is more applicable to present conditions, as well as more suitable to 
the needs of the individual housewife and the purposes of the small Local Club, 
while it contains much of the more academic matter that appeared in the Ten 
Lessons. 

The Publishers of The Home Keeping Book urge all home-keepers to send 
to the Federal Food Administrators of their Home States (see Names and Ad- 
dresses on page 9 of this Supplement) for copies of the Nine Lessons on Food 
in War and Peace. 

We urge all Local Clubs to secure copies of the Nine Lessons; also to ap- 
point a Committee to go to the nearest local Public Library, read the Ten Lessons 
(out of print as above) and copy such matter as will be of interest to the Club, as 
does not appear covered in a better manner for the Club's use in the Nine Lessons. 

We will give herewith only the Titles of the Nine Lessons, together with 
Miss Tarbell's most excellent Introduction, as the booklet itself is too compre- 
hensive for us to attempt to include it here in full, and too valuable and important 
to be injured by rehashing in excerpt form. Get the book itself, for your own 
use. 

We will give some of the more important paragraphs, and more detail as to 
contents, on the Ten Lessons, which are out of print. 

"FOOD IN WAR AND PEACE" 

This is a comprehensive study of the entire question of food economics, 
planned and arranged for Home Study Clubs, and of almost inestimable value to 
the home-keeper, both in her own home and for use in Home Study Clubs and 
Societies. 

It is a booklet of considerable size, a complete text-book in itself. 

Write to the Federal Food Administrator for your State, and obtain a copy. 

The following are the Titles to Food in War and Peace: 

LESSON I. — Food and the War. Herbert Hoo- LESSON VI. — Milk and Its Products. Dr. La-

"FOOD IN WAR AND PEACE" 

The United States Food Administration, in co-operation with the Depart- 
ment of Agriculture and the Woman's Committee of the Council of National De- 
fense, has issued the above pamphlet containing a series of lessons for the special 
use of clubs and neighborhood groups, showing what the nation is asked to do 
about the food supply, and why. The lessons have been prepared in response to 
many requests for a simple and brief statement of the kind and quantity of food 
needed for health, and of the ways in which changes may safely be made so that 
the requests of the Food Administration for saving, substituting, and using the 
various foods may be intelligently, rather than arbitrarily, obeyed. 

Each lesson has been prepared by a specialist whose authority is unques- 
tioned. U. S. Food Administrator Hoover has explained the present situation in 
his discussion of "Food and the War " ; Dr. Graham Lusk, of the Advisory Com- 
mittee on Food Utilization of the Food Administration, has told us what food we 
should use in a day, and has explained "calories" and other puzzling terms; Dr. 
Alonzo E. Taylor, who is associated with the Food Administration and with the 
War Trade Board, and who has spent much time abroad since the war began, has 
told us about wheat, why we should save it, and how to use it. Other lessons 
have been written by Dr. C. F. Langworthy and Miss Caroline Hunt of the Office 
of Home Economics, and Dr. Charles J. Brand of the U. S. Office of Markets, De- 
partment of Agriculture; by Dr. E. V. McCollum, of Johns Hopkins; Dr. Lafay- 
ette B. Mendel, of Yale; and Dr. Ruth Wheeler, of the University of Illinois. Miss 
Ida M. Tarbell has written the introduction to the lessons. 

A number of practical suggestions and some recipes have been added by 
the editors to each of these papers, as w^ell as a few references, and a list of lantern 
slides. 

The lessons may be obtained in each State from the Federal Food Admin- 
istrator. A limited free edition has been issued. Arrangements may also be 
made with the Illustration Division, U. S. Food Administration, for the use of the 
lantern slides. 

INTRODUCTION 
By IDA M. TARBELL 

Woman's Committee, Council of National Defense 

No finer piece of practical work was ever put up to the American woman 
than that assigned her in the National Campaign for Food Control. There are no 
two questions about the necessity for scientific handling of our food supply. All 
that is needed to prove the point is to apply the multiplication table. We must so 
use our food that we keep all of our people abundantly nourished. At the same 
time, we must release for our Allies sufficient quantities of those foods which are 
necessary for their health and which can only be obtained through us. The mul- 
tiplication table shows that it can be done. But to do it means not only resolution 
— it means knowledge. Nothing is more needed at the moment than a clear un- 
derstanding by all women of just how their part in this tremendous task is to be 
carried out. 

It is not easy for the busy woman who is not in direct touch with the 
sources of scientific information on the subject of food to learn just what she ought 
to do and how^ to do it. She knows that she is not doing her part unless in place 
of those things that she gives up for the sake of our Allies, she provides her fam- 
ily with others which are equally nutritious. But where can she learn how to do 
this? 



SUPPLEMENT— FOOD CONSERVATION 



S-55 



This set of lessons has been prepared for her. Their intelligent use will 
teach her how to readjust the family meals to meet the national needs. 

The lessons have been planned and edited, at the request of the Woman's 
Committee of the Council of National Defense, by experts from the U. S. Depart- 
ment of Agriculture and from the U. S. Food Administration. A glance at the 
list of names attached to these different lessons will show that the editors have 
been able to rally to their help some of the best known specialists in the country. 
It is only another of the many proofs that we are having that there is no talent so 
superior that it does not gladly turn all that it has to the use of the country. 

It is believed that these lessons, with their lists of references and of care- 
fully selected lantern slides, by w^hich they may be illustrated, will be of enormous 
educational value. What is taught here is not only good for war times; it is equally 
a contribution to peace. To learn to do every common thing in life in the most 
scientific manner is one of our high duties at the present moment, but learning to 
meet our great need now will do much to help us as a nation in the future to do 
these common things in a finer and more comprehending way.

TEN LESSONS ON FOOD CONSERVATION 

(Outlines and Extracts from Bulletins) 
UNITED STATES FOOD ADMINISTRATION 

This booklet is out of print; copies are on file and available in public libraries. 



The purpose of the course is threefold. The 
first aim is to acquaint students in the country with 
the world situation. Food shortage, which is so 
serious as to necessitate the creation of machinery 
for food administration, is especially emphasized. 
Tentative plans for the organization of this depart- 
ment are given. Lesson 1 covers this ground. 

Second, the course is designed to tell students 
definite and immediate things to do, and wherever 
possible show how^ to do them. This work is al- 
ready well under way in many States, so that 
Lessons II to IX, inclusive, reinforce and reiterate 
what in many cases the local people are already 
doing. 



These lessons are given in outline form, and are 
meant to be suggestive only. In many instances 
they w^ill have to be changed, rearranged, and re- 
grouped to meet local conditions. 

The third and last aspect of the course, as stated 
in Lesson X, deals w^ith the use to which this ma- 
terial is to be put. Each person who takes this 
course on food conservation should be requested 
to acquaint the family with the urgency of the 
situation, and to ask them to carry out the sug- 
gestions made by the food conservation department 
through whatever local arrangements have been 
made. As these will vary greatly, this office can 
only suggest possible types of local organization.

Orchard Products — Use large amounts of 
fruits, fresh and preserved. 

Dairy Products — Use more whole milk, skim 
milk, buttermilk, cottage cheese. Milk is 
a cheap source of superior protein, there- 
fore it is best for growth and repair. 

Poultry Products — Use eggs as far as pos- 
^"*^ sible. Preserve eggs and can cockerels 

and fowls for future use.

PUBLICATIONS OF VITAL INTEREST 

THE FOOD CONSERVATION PROGRAM 

The education of 100,000,000 people in new habits of eating is one of the 
great problems resulting from the war. 

With the shortage of food abroad, with the partial failure of transportation, 
the shortage of labor, and the resulting w^orld conditions, each one of us has a new 
responsibility. We must conserve and protect the food supply now in existence or 
soon to be harvested, so that it will supply the population of this country and of 
our European allies. 

We can do this if we save and if we do not waste. It will require our care- 
ful thought three times a day. Not only must we eat carefully the products of the 
day, but we must store carefully the perishable vegetables and fruits that are 
abundant. 

The home should be the center for the production and storing of canned 
fruits and vegetables, jellies and preserves. It should have its bags and boxes of 
dried fruits, vegetables and cereals. By the use of sugar in preserving fruits and 
fruit juices we can save materially on butter. 

We must begin a systematic campaign against gophers, rats, mice, and

THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— SUPPLEMENT 



THE CORNELL READING COURSE FOR THE HOME 

This course was instituted so that the problems especially of the farm home 
could be studied in the same scientific way as are those of the farm. The lessons 
are on such household subjects as relate to food, shelter and clothing, and are ac- 
companied by discussion papers. The discussion papers contain questions that 
bring out the point of view of the practical housekeeper. As a result there has 
been a large personal correspondence with the women of the State of New York, 
who are at liberty to ask questions at any time relating to their home problems. 

The Reading Course is free to residents of New York State. A lesson is 
issued each month.

FUEL ADMINISTRATION 

SUB-SUPPLEMENT 

At the last moment — indeed, while this work is on the press — 
we have been requested to include a few pages on the urgent need 
of our country to SAVE FUEL— and to PROVIDE NOW for the 
COMING WINTER'S NEEDS— for each and aU of us to do our part 
to Eissist the Fuel Administration in its work — as gravely important 
in many ways as the saving of food. 

No such fuel shortage as occurred last winter must be permitted 
again — with the tie-up in transportation, the congestion of manufac- 
tures, and the positive human suffering that were endured. It is the 
duty of every man and every woman to do his and her full part to 
prevent ever again even an approach to such conditions. 

It is our pleasure to add these pages in the form of this SUB- 
SUPPLEMENT for the U. S. FUEL ADMINISTRATION.

EARLY BUYING 

and 

CONSERVATION OF COAL 

UNITED STATES FUEL ADMINISTRATION 
Speakers' Series No. 1 

About 2,000 years ago five foolish young women were barred from a wedding 
because they had neglected to buy any oil for their lamps. There were five others who 
had plenty of oil. They were the early buyers. (Matthew, xxv. ) 

The United States Fuel Administration is urging every consumer in the country to 
follow the example of the wise virgins. As a stimulus to cooperation in this matter, the 
price of anthracite coal has been reduced 30c. a ton from April 1 to September I. 

There are two powerful reasons for early buying. One is selfish. The other is 
patriotic. 

You will not only save money by buying early, but you will guard yourself and 
your family from a repetition of the hardships of last winter. 



If you don't want heatless days next winter, 
order your coal now. The Fuel Administration is 
doing its utmost to insure increased production of 
coal. The Director General of Railroads is work- 
ing to increase the transportation facilities of the 
Nation. Their combined efforts, however, may be 
defeated by the recurrence of such weather as 
prevailed last w^inter. They w^ill certainly be de- 
feated unless a large majority of the domestic con- 
sumers cooperate with them by buying early. 

If you order your coal immediately, you will 
be certain to get your winter supply. If you do 
not buy now, you may not get it, and you cer- 
tainly will not get any sympathy from your neigh- 
bors if you shiver. 

Foresight now means anthracite next mnter. 

There is something much more important than 
your personal comfort, however, involved in this 
campaign for early buying. 

One hundred million people must be kept warm 
next w^inter. Hundreds of thousands of factories, 
upon which the United States and the entire civi- 
lized world depend for the successful prosecution 
of the war against Prussian autocracy, must be 
supplied with coal. 

The industrial activity of the Nation has resulted 
in production in excess of our transportation facili- 
ties in other words, we are manufacturing more 

goods than the railroads can carry. 



There is only one way to meet the situation. 
Less freight is moved during the summer months 
than at any other time. The coal must be moved 
in summer. 

Just because you are ^varm now don^t forget 
you w^ere cold last w^inter. If you neglect to buy 
your winter supply now, you will put an unnec- 
essary burden on the railroads. 

Don't say to yourself, "It can't possibly make 
any difference if I don't buy now. Suppose every 
one of the 100,000,000 people of the country took 
that position. What chance do you suppose you 
would have of getting in your winter's coal? What 
right have you to assume others will buy early? 
Are they more provident than you ? Are they 
more patriotic? 

You CAN borrow money. You CAN'T borrow 
coal. Do you get it? if money is not as plentiful 
as it might be, do w^ithout a few of the summer 
clothes you are planning to buy — cut down your 
summer trip — borrow money if necessary— do 
something — anything that will enable you to buy 
your coal now. 

There will be an increasing demand for coal 
cars as the season advances. The United States 
has taken over .nearly 700,000 tons of Dutch 
shipping. Before the summer is over many ships 
will be launched by the Shipping Board and added 
to the merchant marine of the United States. 



CONSERVATION OF COAL 

Conservation is another name for economy, and economy has been defined face- 
tiously by some one who name is not important as "doing without something you want 
in order to buy something you don't want." That definition, however, does not fit the 
kind of economy you are urged to use in cooperating with the United States Fuel Admin- 
istration. 

You wanted coal last winter. You will want it just as much next winter. Just 
think how badly you will want it if you haven't got it. 

S-70 



SUPPLEMENT— FUEL ADMINISTRATION 



S-7I 



You have no right to talk about inefficiency in 
others until you have bought your winter's supply 
of coal and thus helped lift the burden from the 
railroads. The United States has entered the war, 
and every factory has increased its demand for 
coal. This year there will be more factories. 
There wU be more demand. Every war industry 
will be working at top speed turning out materials 
for ships and airplanes, and in making munitions 
and supplies of all kinds. 

Two things must be done to avert a greater 
shortage this year than occurred last year. 

More coal must be taken out of the mines, and 
less coal put into household furnaces. 

Increase in production will be difficult under 
any circumstances. It w^ill be impossible unless 
you cooperate by ordering your coal now. This 
is not exaggeration. It is a cold fact. 

In London and Paris they hide in the coal cellars 
from the air raids. You may have to do the same 
thing if you don't fill your cellar with coal now. 
Coal cannot be stored at the mines, and when 
there are no orders to be filled the mines close 
down. Your order w^ill help to keep them busy 
during the summer. This is the only way pro- 
duction can be increased. 

That extra shovelful of coal you save will send 
a troopship faster through the danger zone. The 
Fuel Administration cannot regulate the amount 
of coal you shall burn each day. It has regulated, 
how^ever, the amount you w^ill be allowed to buy. 
Your retail dealers know how much you have been 
accustomed to use, or should use, and they have 
been warned by the Fuel- Administration not to 
sell you more than your normal supply. 

If you waste that supply and run short before 
the winter is over, it will be your own fault. It 
is up to you to save it in every possible way. 



When you try to borrow coal next winter you'll 
only borrow trouble. Buy yours now w^hile the 
price is reduced. "Over there," when the men go 
into the trenches, each one has the same quan- 
tity of water in his canteen; just enough to last 

him until he gets back if he does get back to 

camp. He knows exactly how many swallow^s 
of water there are in that canteen, and that if he 
does not save it he v^rill suffer, because it is a point 
of honor w^ith him not to take water from another's 
canteen, even though suffering the tortures of the 
damned. Will you — can you — fail to practice as 
much self-control in the saving of coal as that boy 
does in the saving of water? 

Economical use of your coal, however, is not the 
only w^ay you can help the Fuel Administration 
in its campaign for conservation. 

That campaign will include every possible means 
for saving coal. Many of the methods used w^ill 
cause you annoyance, inconvenience, sacrifice of 
pleasure, perhaps even loss of income. There is 
not one of you who would hesitate to make heroic 
sacrifices. Will you refuse, then, to make those 
small sacrifices without which America cannot 
win this war? Will you jeopardize the lives of 
those boys who are fighting for you by refusing 
to save coal, when every shovelful you save means 
a shovelful for the factories that are making thfe 
munitions, the food, and the clothing for them? 

A cold citizen doesn't make a w^arm patriot. Go 
to the telephone and order your winter's coal now. 

Does your blood boil when you read and hear of 
Prussian atrocities? Do you see red when you 
read of the air raids on defenseless towns, the 
bombardment of Paris, the murder of w^omen and 
children? Do you w^ant to get into the fight? 

You can fight Germany by heeding the Fuel 
Administration's appeals. 



EARLY PURCHASE OF COAL URGENT 

Dr. Harry A. Garfield, United States Fuel Administrator, made the following state- 
ment in regard to the importance of buying coal early: 

"Place your orders at once. If domestic consumers have not sufficient storage 
space for the coal they will need, they should enlarge their bins. If public utilities and 
industries engaged upon Government work have not sufficient storage space they should 
at once provide it." 



The householder in Germany can get only one- 
third of the coal he wants. You can get all you 
need if you buy now. "The production of coal in 
this country is fundamentally a transportation 
problem. There are enough coal cars and enough 
locomotives to transport the necessary quantity of 
coal only if every car and every locomotive is 
used to its maximum capacity every day in the 



year. There are enough operatives in the mine 
to get the coal from the ground if those operatives 
can work every day in the year and if the coal 
cars and locomotives are available every day. If 
the coal cars are idle for a week or a month the 
result is a loss of a week's or a month's possible 
coal production. There is no way to make up 
this loss. The country needs the greatest utiliza- 



S-72 



THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— SUPPLEMENT 



tion of the coal-carrying facilities every week and 
every month. It has no surplus cars and no sur- 
plus locomotives to carry more coal in a succeed- 
ing week or in a succeeding month to make up 
for the failure to use the existing cars and loco- 
motives in a preceding month." 

The coal operators cannot store coal when it 
comes from the mine. You can. Make space for 
the coal you will use next winter — then fill it. 
*'There is plenty of coal in the ground to meet 
every need. This coal can be taken from the 
ground only in consequence of orders placed with 
the operators. If those orders are delayed, the 
coal remains w^here nature has put it. Coal 
operators have no other storage space for their 
coal. Unless the operators have orders for their 
coal they cannot load the coal cars, nor w^ill the 
coal cars be placed at their mines. Without orders 
for coal the operators cannot ship it, for they can 
give no directions where it should be taken." 

One of the worst forms of slacking is putting off 
doing your duty. Order your supply of coal at once. 
"Inconvenience of paying for coal in the spring 



or summer, when it will not be needed until 
autumn or winter, should not influence any con- 
sumer to delay placing his order and securing his 
supply. It is far wiser to borrow money in the 
spring to pay for one's coal than to wait until 
autumn or winter, when, if the coal has not been 
mined and shipped, money cannot procure it." 

"The Fuel Administration, through the State 
fuel administrators and local committees, is pre- 
pared in every reasonable way to aid public utili- 
ties, essential industries, retail dealers, and domes- 
tic consumers in placing their orders and in secur- 
ing assurance of a sufficient supply of fuel. All 
these Governmental agencies, how^ever, are pow^er- 
less if the consumers themselves fail to act. Again, 
therefore, the Fuel Administration urges every 
consumer to place his orders immediately. This 
should ordinarily be done through the medium of 
supply upon which the consumer has relied in the 
past. If this course is follow^ed, it may be hoped 
that the suffering and loss of the past winter will 
not be repeated. If it is not done, consumers 
w^ill have themselves to blame." 



HOW COAL USERS CAN HELP WIN THE WAR 



If you take care of the shovelful, the coal mines 
will take care of the rest. The follo\ving statement 
w^as made by Dr. Garfield as to the necessity for 
cooperation on the part of consumers, and the 
steps that have been taken by the United States 
Fuel Administration to improve the quality and 
facilitate the distribution of coal : 

"The Fuel .Administration must have the support 
and the active cooperation, not only of those w^ho 
are engaged in production and distribution of fuel, 
but of every coal user in the country. Each must 
bear his share of the patriotic sacrifice which must 
be made if the coal supply is to be properly in- 
creased and adequately distributed." 

You can afford to borrow money to lay in your 
supply of anthracite now. The 30 cents a ton 
reduction in price will pay the interest on w^hat 
you borrow^. "An adequate coal supply is vital 
to the winning of the \var. Without it we cannot 
make munitions or other war supplies or build the 
ships \vhich must carry men and materials to the 
battle front. Without it industries will be stopped, 
labor thrown out of employment, and the homes 
of the people w^iil be cold." 

"By carefully drawn regulations the Fuel Ad- 
ministration has insured the shipment of 'clean 
coal' from the mines. Coal containing an undue 
amount of foreign matter w^ill be penalized in 
price, and producers who take extraordinary 
measures in the preparation of their coal will be 
recompensed. These measures w^ill keep off the 
railroads and out of the bins of the consumers 



a large amount of unburnable material which was 
included in last year's coal production." 

There are a hundred ways to economize in the 
use of coal. Practice some of them. "The Fuel 
Administration expects the coal consumers, con- 
tinuing their patriotic cooperation with the Gov- 
ernment in all its war measures, to maintain a 
steady and constant demand for coal in order to 
attain this result." 

Uncle Sam can't send supplies to the boys over 
there w^ithout coal. Save some to help your boy 
and your neighbor's boy. "To safeguard the con- 
sumer, the Fuel Administration has prescribed 
regulations to prevent profiteering and to govern 
the distribution of coal by licensed jobbers and by 
retailers. Each domestic consumer w^ill be per- 
mitted to secure a full normal supply of coal, but 
no more." 

"Every ton of coal that is hoarded against 
future needs and is not used during the winter is 
actual waste. The labor and transportation used 
to bring the coal to the consumer and the actual 
energy of the coal itself are w^ithheld from doing 
their part tow^ard speedy victory. Consumers 
should secure just a little less coal than they be- 
lieve they need and should make every shovelful 
give its full value in heat and power. Every 
shovelful saved means help for the industries in 
turning out supplies for our troops abroad, help 
for the ships that must bridge the 3.000-mile gap 
betw^een our shores and the battle front, and help 
toward ultimate victory." 



EMERGENCY FUEL FROM THE FARM WOODLAND 

Circular 79, OfBce of the Secretary 
United States Department of Agriculture 

By A. F. HAWES 

Extension Specialist 
Forest Service and States Relations Service 

Because of the heavy demand for coal, both for commercial as well as domestic 
use, and because of the great burden laid upon the Nation's transportation facilities and 
the possible shortage of coal in certain sections of the country, the demand should be re- 
lieved wherever feasible. Farmers frequently are situated so they can profitably supply 
fuel from their woodlands and thus relieve, to a considerable extent, the demand for coal. 



Manufacturers, of course, cannot substitute 
wood for coal; neither can city people, because 
this would result in even greater railroad conges- 
tion. Nor is it likely that in either the South or 
the West the use of wood for fuel can be greatly 
increased. But it ought to be entirely practicable 
in many cases to replace coal with wood for fuel. 
If, by substituting w^ood, one-quarter of the coal 
burned by farmers and one-tenth of the coal 
burned in villages could be saved, the total saving 
w^ould amount to between 65,000 and 70,000 car- 
loads. 

It is where team-hauled wood can be used in 
place of railroad-hauled coal that the change should 
be made. Farmers who own w^oodlands and 
people in villages who can purchase wood from 
nearby farms are the ones in the best position to 
reduce their consumption of coal. For heating 
many kinds of buildings wood is the more con- 
venient and cheaper fuel. This is particularly 
true in the case of churches, halls, summer cot- 
tages, and other buildings for which heat is re- 
quired only occasionally; but is then wanted in 
large volume at short notice. 

Furnaces are built especially for burning wood 
in 3 or 4-foot lengths. Short lengths, of course, 
can readily be burned in an ordinary coal furnace 
or in a box stove, though this is rather wasteful 
of fuel. Many furnace manufacturers, how^ever, 
make a special wood grate for use in their fur- 
naces. One advantage in burning wood is that 
on moderately cool days the furnace can be run 
at a lower ebb than when coal is used, consum- 
ing only enough fuel to remove the chill. When 
wood is used in a round pot furnace, care should 
be taken to have each piece lie flat. 

If a stove grate is too coarse for wood, a sheet 
iron cover over a good part of the surface will 
make it suitable, or a few fire bricks can be used. 
Wood grates are sold which are made in two 
pieces and which can be inserted through the fire 
door and placed on top of the regular grate. 



RELATIVE HEATING VALUE OF WOOD 
AND COAL 

In the matter of heating value, one standard 
cord of well-seasoned hickory, oak, beech, birch, 
hard maple, ash, elm, locust, or cherry is approxi- 
mately equal to one ton (2,000 pounds) of an- 
thracite coal. It takes a cord and a half of soft 
maple and two cords of cedar, poplar, or bass- 
wood, however, to give the same amount of heat. 

One cord of mixed wood, well seasoned, equals 
in heating value at least one ton (2,000 pounds) 
of average-grade bituminous coal. 

Table I shows the price which the consun'er 
can afford to pay for a cord of wood as the 
equivalent of anthracite coal at various prices.

If the consumer can buy coal at $8 a ton, it 
would hardly be worth his while to burn first-class 
wood at $8 a cord, except in an open fireplace, 
because coal is a more convenient fuel. If, how- 
ever, coal becomes so scarce that it cannot be 
secured in sufficient quantities, the consumer will, 
in some cases, have to burn w^ood at $10 or even 
$ I 5 a cord.

THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— SUPPLEMENT 



WOOD A PROFITABLE FARM CROP. 

Firewood ought to bring a better profit this year 
than ever before, on account of the higher prices 
which are likely to prevail. Wood is a much less 
perishable crop than many which the farmer raises. 
When properly piled, the better kinds of wood will 
last from two to three years, though it steadily 
deteriorates after the first year. To have the best 
heating value, as well as to reduce the cost of 
hauling, wood should be thoroughly seasoned, 
which means air-drying it, from six to eight months. 
When piled so as to get a good circulation of 
air, however, 50 per cent of the moisture may 
be removed in three months. Wood cut in Octo- 
ber and November, therefore, may be burned the 
latter part of the w^inter. 

OPPORTUNITY TO IMPROVE THE WOODLAND 

The prices which cordwood will likely bring 
this year offer an opportunity for the farmer to 
improve his woodland. Improving the v^^oodland 
means weeding oiit the poorer trees. In the past 
this has seldom been practicable, for the inferior 
wood was not marketable. With w^ood bringing 
only from $4 to $5 a cord, there is very little 
opportunity to secure a profit of even $1 a cord. 
But with the prices indicated for the coming win- 
ter, thinnings become practicable over a wide 
range of country in the vicinity of good markets. 

Some of the things to remember when cutting 
in the w^oodland are: 

I. Dead or dying trees should be removed. This 
not only utilizes material which is fairly dry, and 
which would otherwise be wasted, but lessens the 
danger of fire. 



2. Good, sound, straight logs ordinarily should 
not be used for fuel, since they are more valuable 
for lumber. There is a great difference betw^een 
the prices paid for logs of different grades, even 
of the same kind of w^ood. Branches, crooked and 
decayed logs, trunks broken in felling or otherwise 
defective, should be used for firewood. 

3. Trees likely to be attacked by insects or 
fungi should be removed to safeguard those which 
remain. In eastern New England, for example, the 
gipsy moth is a serious enemy of many w^oods. 
Several of these are of little value and can well 
be renrioved, thus reducing the food available for 
the insects. Where the chestnut blight is serious, 
the chestnut should be largely cut. 

4. No portion of the woodland should be cut 
clean unless the ow^ner has carefully considered 
the matter and decided that that particular part 
is best adapted for farm purposes, or that he will 
replant it with forest trees. Old trees, w^here they 
predominate, should be gradually removed, since 
they are not increasing in value. The next genera- 
tion of trees w^ill be largely determined by those 
which are left for seed. The successful w^oodland 
owner will study the grow^th and uses of the dif- 
ferent kinds of trees. He will then cut out those 
of little value and slow growth and keep for seed 
purposes those which will product valuable lumber 
in a relatively short time. Table 2 classifies in 
a general w^ay the trees which should be favored 
and those which should be removed for fuel. In- 
ferior individuals of the better species, e. g., those 
which are diseased or which are likely to be 
blown over, should, of course, be cut.

To secure a second grow^th of better trees, sev- 
eral things must be borne in mind: (a) Too large 
openings should not be made, because the ground 
wll dry out and weeds, like berry bushes, w^ill 
come in and crowd out the young trees. For this 



reason it is often a good plan to leave some of 
the inferior trees for shade. (b) Some trees, like 
the oaks, hickories, and beech, have heavy seeds 
or nuts which cannot be transported any distance 
except by animals or birds, while others, like the 



SUPPLEMENT— FUEL ADMINISTRATION 



S-75 



birch, maple, ash, and basswood, have light seeds 
which are carried long distances by the wind. For 
this reason more frequent seed trees of the nut 
varieties are necessary to get a good stocking of 
young trees. 

5. Woodlands made up of a nearly even-aged 
stand of second growth are more comparable to 
the garden than to the dairy. Here the probleni 
is to remove the weeds as a means of getting a 
quicker yield of timber. The small stunted trees 
are the weeds, since they can never make a 
normal growth. The large healthy trees should 
be favored, because they w^ill grow rapidly to 
maturity. They are not to be confused with the 
mature trees in the old woodland, though in gen- 
eral the same species will be favored in both cases. 

OWNER SHOULD SECURE EXPERT ADVICE 

The foregoing suggestions regarding methods 
of cutting should be taken simply as suggestions. 
The woodland owner who wishes to avail himself 
of the opportunity to improve his woodland, which 
the high price of wood makes possible, should 
secure specific information from some reliable 



forester. In States having a State forester, appli- 
cation should be made to him. In others, applica- 
tion should be made to the county agent, the State 
agricultural college, or to the United States Forest 
Service, Washington, D. C. 

COMMUNITY ACTION REGARDING WOOD 
SUPPLY 

Communities which feel they are threatened 
with a serious fuel shortage w^ill do well to take 
measures to stimulate the cutting of wood. Farm- 
ers may hesitate because of the high cost of labor 
to invest money in this way. If, however, a mini- 
mum price sufficient to allow them a fair profit 
could be guaranteed by the consumer, they would 
cut all that was needed for the community. Such 
contracts should be placed as early as possible, so 
that the wood may be properly seasoned. 

Since few farmers get out enough wood to re- 
quire a stovewood mill as part of their equipment, 
it is suggested that a group of farmers operate 
such a mill cooperatively. In many localities, the 
farmers* club would be an admirable organization 
for such an undertaking. 



FIVE WAYS OF SAVING FUEL 

IN HEATING HOUSES 

(From Technical Paper 199, Dept. of Interior) 

By HENRY KREISINGER 



INTRODUCTION 

This country faces a shortage of coal, and it is the patriotic duty of every citizen 
to save coal in heating his home. If everybody *'does his bit,'* a ton of coal at each 
home can be saved easily during the winter. For the entire country, this saving would 
amount to 20,000,000 tons of coal, which is nearly as much as all the coal mined in France 
during the present year. Five w^ays in w^hich coal can be saved are as follow^s: 

1 . Of the coals available in your market select the one that requires the least 
attention in burning. 

2. Use an economical method of burning your coal. 

3. Keep your house temperature 62 to 65 degrees F., instead of 72 to 75 degrees. 

4. Heat as few rooms as the comfort of your family will permit. 

5. Shorten the heating season as much as possible. 



1 



1. SELECTION OF COALS 

In Kouse-heating equipment the fires can be 
given very little attention; therefore fuels that re- 
quire little attention in burning are the most 
economical and give the best satisfaction. In time 
of war less desirable coal may have to be used, in 
order to simplify transportation problems, but the 
fact remains that some coals are more efficient 
than others when the same attention is given the 
fire. Usually the man of the house can attend 
to the furnace early in the morning and again in 
the evening. In some houses the furnace is at- 
tended only w^hen the house becomes either too 
hot or too cold, and thus the fire is allowed to 
run from one extreme to the other, conditions 
which are very unfavorable to saving of fuel. 

In order that a fuel may be burned economically 
in a house-heating furnace, the fuel used should 
be of such kind that the fire requires little atten- 
tion. The follow^ing fuels, in the order named, 
are the best fuels for house-heating purposes: 

Anthracite coal in sizes from Yl inch to egg size. 

Gas-retort or metallurgical coke in pieces yi 
inch to 3 inches across. 

Coal briquets 2 to 3 inches in diameter. 

Screened Pocahontas (semi-bituminous) coal 
over '/4 inch and through 3 or 4 inch screen. 

Sized bituminous coal in pieces |/2 to 3 inches 
across. 

If these fuels can be bought, fine sizes or slack 
coal or other fuels requiring frequent attention 
when burning should be left for power plants, 
where the firemen can and should give the fires 
frequent attention. 



2. 



USE AN ECONOMICAL METHOD OF 
BURNING YOUR COAL 

The conditions under which house-heating ap- 
paratus is used are difficult to meet. The tem- 
perature of the house is to be kept uniform, with 
the firings far apart and with little attention given 
to the fires. The questions for each household to 
decide are: How much variation in the house 
temperature can be tolerated, and how^ much atten- 
tion can be given to the furnace. The kind of 
heating apparatus has a great deal to do w^ith the 
uniformity of the house temperature and the 
amount of attention that must be given to the 
fire. Hot-water systems will give much more uni- 
form temperature w^ith less attention to the fires 
than hot-air systems. No one set of rules will 
work satisfactorily in all cases. 

FIRING ANTHRACITE 

When firing anthracite, the best results are ob- 
tained by spreading the coal evenly over the entire 
fuel bed. The fire should not be allowed to be- 
come too low^ before putting on a fresh firing. A 
fuel bed 5 to 1 inches thick gives good results. 
The fire should be disturbed as little as possible. 

FIRING BRIQUETS 

Briquets, when properly made, are very good 
fuel for house-heating purposes. However, the 
supply is decidedly limited. When burning bri- 
quets the fuel bed should be kept 8 to 12 inches 
thick. The fresh charges should be spread evenly 
over the grate area. The fire must not be dis- 
turbed. Poking breaks the briquets and spoils 
the fire. 

FIRING SEMI-BITUMINOUS COALS 

The semi-bituminous coals of the Pocahontas 



S-76 



SUPPLEMENT— FUEL ADMINISTRATION 



S-77 



type are good fuel for heating a house. They are 
' nearly smokeless and make but little soot. For 
regular firing the coal can be spread evenly over 
the entire fuel bed; or, it can be fired like bitu- 
minous coal, the fresh charges being placed alter- 
nately on one side of the grate and part of the 
surface of the fuel bed left uncovered. The al- 
ternate method should be used if the firings are 
heavy. The fire keeps better overnight if the last 
firing is heaped to one side of the grate. Good 
results are obtained with fires 8 to I inches thick. 

FIRING BITUMINOUS COALS 

The bituminous, or soft coals, are smoky and 
cover the flue surfaces with a large amount of 
soot and tar, which reduces the transfer of heat 
and impairs the draft. Bituminous coal should be 
fired by placing the fresh charge on one side of 
the grate only, leaving part of the surface of the 
fuel bed uncovered. The volatile matter rising 
from the freshly fired coal is ignited by the red- 
hot coal of the uncovered part of the fire and a 
large part of it burns. 

If the entire surface of the fuel bed is covered 
with a heavy charge, the volatile matter from the 
fired coal does not ignite for a considerable length 
of time after firing and passes away unburned as 
tarry, greenish-yellow smoke. The furnace and 
the flues become filled with the smoke and when 
the fire finally works its way through the fresh 
layer of coal the smoke and the gases may ignite 
with an explosion violent enough to blow the 
pipes down and fill the house with smoke. These 
explosions are particularly apt to happen if the 
coal contains much slack; therefore, with such 
coal particular care should be taken that part or 
the bright fire remains uncovered. This method 
of firing reduces the amount of soot deposited in 
the flues, so that less frequent cleaning is neces- 
sary; it also reduces the heat losses from incom- 
plete combustion, thus directly effecting a saving 
of coal. 

DRAFT REGULATION 

Draft regulation is perhaps the most important 
factor in burning coal efficiently in house-heating 
furnaces. The draft is regulated mainly with three 
dampers; one of these is on the ash-pit doors, 
one on the firing door, and one in the pipe con- 
necting the furnace with the chimney. For many 
furnaces the damper in the flue pipe is an opening 
covered with a hinged lid A, in Fig. 1. When this 
lid is closed the full chimney draft is effective 
in the furnace. When the lid is lifted, the chim- 
ney draws air from the cellar instead of drawing 
the gases out of the furnace, and the draft in the 
furnace is reduced almost to nothing. Between 
the two extremes any draft can be obtained by 
proper adjustment of the lid. 

The damper B on the ash-pit door regulates the 
flow of air through the fire, and the amount of 



air flowing through the fire determines the rate 
of combustion, or the amount of coal that the 
furnace can burn in an hour. Therefore, to con- 
trol the rate of combustion and thereby regulate 
the amount of heat the furnace delivers to the 
house, the furnace attendant adjusts the damper 
in the ash-pit door and the damper to the chimney.

F'g- 1- — Position of dampers in a house-heating 
furnace. Damper A regulates the draft in 
the furnace and should be used with Dampers 
B and C. Damper B regulates the supply of 
air through the grate and the rate at which 
the coal burns. Damper C regulates the 
supply of air over the fire and the complete- 
ness of combustion. Damper D controls the 
draft and should be used with Damper A. 
The Damper C in the firing door supplies air 
over fire needed to burn the gases rising from 
the fuel bed; therefore, its regulation controls the 
completeness of combustion of these gases. When 
soft coal is burned, a large volume of combustible 
gases rises from the fuel bed immediately after 
the firing; therefore, the damper in the fire door 
must be opened enough to allow the air necessary 
for burning the gases to enter the furnace. After 
the smoky gases cease to rise from the freshly 
fired coal, the quantity of air supplied over the 
fuel bed can be reduced by partly closing the 
damper in the firing door. There should be a 
damper, D, in the smoke pipe; this damper can 
be used in addition to Damper A to control the 
draft. 

No rule can be given for the exact adjustment 
of the dampers. The proper adjustment must be 
ascertained by trial; with a little care and some 
patience the proper adjustment of the dampers 
of any furnace can be determined. In general, to 
make the fire burn faster, close the lid A (Fig. I) 
in the pipe leading to the chimney and open the 



S-78 



THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— SUPPLEMENT 



Damper B (Fig. I) in the ash-pit door. To make 
the fire burn slower, raise somewhat the lid in the 
check draft A and partly close the Damper B in 
the ash-pit door. The Damper C in the firing door 
is more difficult to adjust because there is no 
way to determine the completeness of combustion. 
In burning soft coal, this damper should be 
slightly open all the time. In burning hard coal 
or coke enough air for complete combustion may 
enter the furnace through various leaks, even when 
the damper is completely closed. 

3. KEEPING THE HOUSE TEMPERATURE 
LOWER 

in heating houses considerable fuel can be saved 
by keeping the temperature in the house 5 " to 
10° F. lower than is customary; instead of the 
temperature being between 70° and 74° F., it 
can be kept between 62° and 68° F. without any 
discomfort or any danger to health. In fact, some 
medical authorities ascribe the "colds" common 
in winter to living in too warm houses. Thus 
Dr. William Brady writes: 

"Air need never be heated above 65° F. for 
comfort. Anything above that point represents 
waste and extravagance. It simply runs up a big 
coal bill and opens various doors to the coming 
of the doctor. The onset of cough in winter is 
almost a sure sign of such extravagance." 

Those interested in saving the country's fuel and 
lowering their own coal bills will be glad to know 
that keeping the house at 65° instead of 72' F., 
means a saving of 15 to 20 per cent of their 
fuel. It may also niean a saving on the doctor's 
bill. 

4. HEATING FEWER ROOMS 

Another easy saving of fuel can be effected by 



heating fewer rooms in the house. In many 
Houses the family can get along comfortably by 
keeping warm three or four rooms instead of 
heating six or seven rooms. And this can be done 
without any real hardship on the family. Really, 
only the three rooms in w^hich the family lives need 
be heated at all. If consumptives can get well 
by sleeping outdoors, why could not well people 
keep well by sleeping in unhealed bedrooms with 
the windows \%'ide open ? 

5. SHORTENING THE HEATING SEASON 

In some homes the furnace is started too early 
in the fall and is run too late in the spring. The 
chimneys of these homes are belching smoke and 
spreading soot over their neighborhood, while the 
neighbors keep windows and doors open to the 
outside air and even sit on the front porches. 
These faint-hearted people, in their fear of catch- 
ing cold, heat their houses unnecessarily; thus they 
■^vaste the country's coal, increase their coal billst 
invite sickness into their homes, and make life 
unpleasant to their neighbors. When mornings 
and evenings are chilly, a grate fire for a short 
time in one or two rooms will make the house 
comfortable. 

CONCLUSION 
Every householder, by endeavoring to save coal 
in the ways suggested, can render his country 
valuable service, and he will not be doing his full 
duty tow^ard his country unless he renders such 
service as he can. In addition, he should remem- 
ber that besides helping his country he will help 
to shorten the misery and the horror of the great 
war.

of 
THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK 



To the "Home-Keeper": 

This book is arranged so that it is of equal value to the "beginner at home- 
making" and the well advised home-keeper of long experience. 

Patterns and instructions to serve as guide and mentor to the beginner 
will be found provided in terms and arrangement of the easiest simplicity. Sci- 
entific studies which can be mastered only by those of long practice and much 
experience are provided for the latter. Outlines for independent study are pre- 
sented for both, as well as suggestions for class and club work, and lists of ref- 
erence books and pamphlets for home economic education to almost any degree. 

But in the main the book is intended for an everyday practical reference- 
work for the average home-keeper in the average home ; it is simple in its terms ; 
its guideposts, for finding one's way about, are clear, concise, and planned for the 
quick finding of what is wanted at the time when it is wanted. 

The woman who has managed a household for some years w^ill have, in 
a miscellaneous collection of magazines, recipe books and clippings, the most of 
the matter contained herein, and because of her familiarity with the assortment 
may be able to find, occasionally, what she wants at the time wanted. 

The book claims usefulness mainly in the fact that its contents are collected 
into the covers of one binding, arranged, classified, indexed, forming a convenient, 
compact, attractive and interesting reference work in all departments of "home- 
keeping." The matter itself is distinctly not original — it is time-tried and tested, 
the last word of the best and most experienced practical authorities in each case. 

— The Publishers. 



To Those to Whom These Presents Shall Come — 

Greeting: 

The Publishers will deeply appreciate it if you will send us, frequently, 
special scraps or memoranda of your own — in as great abundance as you may be 
willing to write them out for us. 

When you have something tried and proven, which you do not find in- 
cluded in this Book, or which improves on what is herein published, either in effi- 
cacy, convenience or economy, we will most sincerely w^elcome its receipt in every 
instance. This most especially applies to the various sections other than Cookery 
and Kitchen Recipes. In helping us in this manner you are helping other "home- 
keepers" — future ow^ners of future editions of the Book, and present owners w^ho 
receive the Supplement Service. 

There is no such other work published as The Home-Keeping Book, pro- 
curable either in the general book market or otherwise. Commend it to your 
friends. 

The Home-Keeping Book is in every way, in fact as well as in spirit, in- 
tended and published with our sincere wish and aspiration to all "home-keepers" of 

"A Long, a Happy and a 
Prosperous Home-Keeping."

"CONSERVATION" DOES NOT MEAN "PRICES" 

It is difficult for the most of us to appreciate the meaning of the term 
"conservation." To us all, at first thought, the entire program seems futile if it 
does not effect, and effect at once a "reduced cost of living" in our own homes. 
"What does it all amount to," we ask, "if meat and grocery bills continue higher 
week by week?" 

Conservation cannot be expressed only in dollars and cents. The saving of 
money is not necessarily synonymous with economy. 

If there were exactly ten barrels of wheat flour in the world, and twenty 
people each wanted a barrel, they might bid up the price until the ten least able to 
pay the advancing bids retired from the competition and the flour went to those 
who were left. Some of the successful ten, however, might have decided to use 
less than a barrel ; some of the others would thus have had a chance. But irrespec- 
tive of how the prices went, the same ten barrels would be booked for consump- 
tion. Although individuals had effected a certain "economy" in this case in not 
bidding — waiting instead for relinquishment of a part of the stock at a lower price 
— there has been no conservation in the total stock. The action may have been 
commendable, in resulting in forcing prices lower, especially provided those who 
sold the flour had been cornering or controlling the market by holding up the total 
stock, or otherwise were undeserving of the prices they were obtaining. But that 
is not conservation. 

If people pay high prices it means merely that some are distributing to 
others a surplus of money which they possess, or feel that they possess. It changes 
the total supply neither of money nor of merchandise ; it tends only to equalize or 
scatter the supply. 

If, however, someone notices that there are only ten barrels of flour in the 
world, that there are two million bushels of corn, that much of this corn is going to 
waste because the farmers cannot get it to market, learns that this corn meal can 
be mixed with wheat flour to make as palatable and wholesome bread as wheat 
flour alone — and proceeds to buy corn meal to use along with the flour — that is 
conservation. Such person has "saved" or "conserved" some actual food stuff; 
the total food stuff of the nations is increased by the amount of corn meal which 
one certain family has consumed — corn otherwise wasted has gone into the human 
stomach for sustenance. If one million families have multiplied this act into one 
million acts, the total food stores of the world have been pronouncedly increased. 

The proportionate increase is in the single act — though less apparent. The 
individual may or may not save money in the process, but that in no way affects the 
conservation that is involved. 

One may, with intelligence, effect the personal economy and the conserva- 
tion together. He does this if the corn is cheaper than the flour as well as being a 
product that is rotting in the bins. If one eats fruit from his own orchard or veget- 
ables from his own garden under conditions where he would otherwise have to see 
them wasted or ship them to a market where some of them will rot, if he buys them 
from his neighbor who cannot ship them to advantage, or if he preserves, dries or 
cans them for winter use, he is conserving and at the same time saving his own 



THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— INTRODUCTORY 



pocketbook. All perishable goods consumed near point of production tend to con- 
servation, for of such goods shipped to market a certain portion will eventually 
spoil and never be consumed at any price. 

If one changes from flour to potatoes, granting that no potatoes are rotting 
in the market but merely that they are cheaper at the time than the flour, he is 
saving money for himself but he is not conserving ; he is adding nothing to the total 
stock unless some of the potato stock of that season's crop is going to waste, in 
this particular instance, however, at this particular time, he is conserving for the 
benefit of the war conditions of the Allies — for the Allies can use and must have 
flour, and w^e cannot send them potatoes. 

When one eats fish in place of meat he conserves food. Cattle, sheep and 
hogs represent a limited and reducing supply; besides, corn or other grain stuffs 
have to be fed to stock to produce stock. But millions of fish infest the waters of 
the sea; they die; alive or dead other fish consume them. Many varieties live 
off of sea vegetation. None of them are fed on what would else be human food. 
The cost of fish represents no cost of production, no diminuation in total food but 
in each case a one hundred per cent, increase. The cost is strictly the labor of tak- 
ing them and marketing them. The eating of fish represents a net gain and is con- 
servation in its widest sense. 

Conservation of food means making less food accomplish the same susten- 
ance, or the same food more sustenance, using waste foods in the stead of foods 
of which little or none is wasted, providing food by tilling soil, by seining the sea, 
or otherwise making food where food did not exist before. 

Bear these principles in mind and follow them and you are "doing your bit 
in the food conservation program which must help keep the world alive during 
this period of shortage of food which must continue and must become yet more 
and more pronounced inevitably until this war for the world's democracy and 
liberty is won.

and Extravagance. 



In no direction can they (the women of America) so greatly 
assist as by enlisting in the service of the Food Administration and 
cheerfully accepting its direction and advice. By so doing they will 
increase the surplus of food available for our own army and for ex- 
port to the Allies. To provide adequate supplies for the coming year 
is of absolutely vital importance to the conduct of the war, and with- 
out a very conscientious elimination of w^aste and very strict economy 
in our food consumption we cannot hope to fulfill this primary duty. 




THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK 

and 
COLLEGE AND GOVERNMENT BULLETINS 

Practically all of the States issue bulletins of great value to the student of 
Home and Food Economics. We cannot incorporate in this work even an approx- 
imation to the wealth of this material. It is not the intention of The "Home- 
Keeping" Book to cover the exhaustive scientific studies which the States, and the 
Government, with their hundreds of trained experts, cover far more thoroughly — 
nor to merely "copy" or "repeat" from their bulletins. 

This work is intended as a concise reference book, not a full scientific treat- 
ise. We try to gather together under headings the more important recommenda- 
tions and conclusions reached by experts, so that a w^oman in her home may get 
the information she wants, quickly, when she w^ants it, rather than be compelled to 
look through many bulletins, or to study those bulletins until she knows much of 
them by heart. 

We commend mastery. We urge all women to by all means send for Govern- 
ment and State bulletins, study them, master as many of them as possible, and 
know her subjects thoroughly. 

But even after this is done she will find constant use for The Home-Keep- 
ing Book for quick reference purposes, for refreshing the memory on details, for 
exact recipes and on subjects she has not seen fit, because not frequently needed, 
to burden her mind with mastering. 

The State Colleges, as a rule, furnish free to residents of their own States, 
the bulletins they publish. To non-residents they usually charge a few cents to 
cover cost. The Government bulletins are mostly free to all; on some there is a 
small charge. 

We are heavily indebted to Government bulletins, and to those of our 
own State (New York) for much information, and for matter copied bodily in this 
book. We have drawn heavily, also, on the bulletins of the low^a State College, 
w^hich publishes certain bulletin work in a form peculiarly adaptable to our use as 
well as peculiarly good. We have used to a less degree bulletin matter from a 
number of the other States. We have drawn strongly on the better class of maga- 
zines and the best of a large number of books published on the various subjects 
embraced in this work. 

These magazines and special book publications are of great value to the 
home-keeper, and she should by no means overlook the Government and State bul- 
letins, but should accumulate a good reference library of such publications. 

This is particularly true at this moment, when it is the absolute duty of 
every woman to "help Wm the war" by studying particularly the bulletins of the 
U. S. Food Administration and the U. S. Department of Agriculture, and generally 
all publications that will instruct and aid her in practical home conservation and 
economics. 

—THE PUBLISHERS. 



WE MAKE NO GUARANTEES 

This book is a compilation. The matter contained in its pages 
has been secured, in all items, from the best sources. The most re- 
liable authorities have been consulted. We are indebted to many 
U. S. Government Bulletins and State and College Bulletins, as well 
as to numerous women's periodicals and reliable books published 
touching on the subjects treated. We have used no matter for which 
it was not stated in connection with the promulgation through the 
above sources that the suggestions or the recipes involved had been 
thoroughly and reliably tried and tested. 

At the same time, errors and mistakes are possible on matter 
even from the best authorities. If such are found, we can only indulge 
the request that our attention be called to the same in order that we 
may make corrections for the benefit of others in the future, as they 
in turn become owners of copies of future editions of The Home- 
Keeping Book.

A Little Sharp Talk to the Woman 

Straight from the Shoulder 

About the Way a Woman Buys 

You go into a grocery store and buy a can of coffee. You see it displayed 
there — or perhaps the grocer mentions it — and you have heard of it before, and so, 
unless you came after some other brand you had been using and liked, you buy it. 

If you don't like it, you don't buy it next time. You try something else you 
have heard of. 

If you do like it, however, and think it good value, you ask for it next time. 
And you keep on asking for it, time after time. Why do you do this? 

Because you like it — and the price suits you. And you learn that each time 
it is the same coffee, and tastes the same and makes the same number of cups at the 
same strength, and — well, you simply feel that you know and sort of value it like an 
old friend. 

If the grocer asks you to try something else, you ask, "Why?" You say, 
"I like this and don't want to change." If he urges you, you think he is doing so 
(and he probably is) because he makes more profit on the other. And that isn't to 
your interest. 

It's perfectly true that he may have something of as good value, that he can 
sell you at less price, but you have never heard of it before — anyhow you like what 
you have and don't care to change. 

He might have it in a bin — bulk goods — or he might label it his "A- 1 Grade." 
And you might try it once and like it — but somehow imagine it seemed to taste 
different the next time. 

Whereupon you would think that perhaps he had changed the mixture in 
that bin, a little bit — the price of one of his blends might have gone up on him — or 
he might have been unable to get exactly what he wanted and had to change. But 
as it was still his "A-1 Grade" he didn't change the label. 

And so you continue to buy package goods — the ones that "make good" 
with you the "first time" — because you find that a given brand sold you back of a 
given label will be always the same as before all the way through. 

But here's something you didn't know: 

It cost the manufacturer of that coffee severiJ times the entire price of that 
first cam you bought to get you to buy it. 

He had been spending advertising money for months, or perhaps years, get- 
ting the name of that brand so frequently before you in various ways, that when you 
saw- it at your grocer's at a time when you were thinking of changing — when some 
other coffee had disappointed you — you promptly recognized that brand as "widely 
advertised" — and decided to try it. 



4 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— A LITTLE SHARP TALK 

The total amount he spends for advertising divided by the number of new 
sales made to new customers, would leave the manufacturer several times the price 
"in the hole" — if those customers didn't come back time after time. And that's why 
you find this coffee always the same. 

The manufacturer couldn't begin to afford to vary it by the flavor of one 
berry. You might stop "coming back" — as you did with some other man's when 
you first tried this one's. And when it costs him the price of three or four cans 
to "get you started " he can't afford that. 

That's the reaison why you can dq>end on advertised goods. That's why you 
get the "package goods habit." Because it pays everybody concerned, including 
most essentially you, on whose satisfaction the wfhole structure depends. 

The Oft-Propounded Query, "Who Pays for the Advertising?" 

Advertising is part of selling cost. It is strictly a proportionate charge. If 
it costs thirty dollars to sell ten sewing machines, the cost on each is three dollars; 
but if it costs fifteen thousand dollars to sell ten thousand machines the cost is one 
dollar and a half on each. If the advertising is successful it sells such a large num- 
ber at once that it not only reduces the selling cost but the manufacturing cost, all 
through the purchase of material, the making and every other factor. 

The query is often heard, regarding some widely advertised goods, and espe- 
cially if they are successfully advertised goods, "Who pays for the advertising? " 

The question is foolish. You pay for it, if you buy the goods, but — you pay 
less for the goods than if they were not advertised. 

If a taxicab charges forty cents a mile for one passenger, or three dollars 
for three passengers for a five-mile trip, do you ask, "Who pays the three dollars?" 
The three passengers chip in, glad to save a dollar apiece. 

That is what happens in successful advertising. You can rest assured that if 
a manufacturer advertises continuously on a large scale it is successful, or he couldn't 
keep it up, and the goods do give the purchaser good value or the advertising would 
not be successful and w^ould not be continued. 

Successful advertising enables a manufacturer to offer better goods at re- 
duced cost of production and reduced cost of selling, and prosper on a small profit. 
It enables you to know what you are getting and that you secure good value and 
uniform quality for your money. 

This is the magic of it and your reason for buying advertised goods. 



ON FURNITURE AND DECORATION 

To the Home-Maker: 

Permit us to say here, briefly, that you should if possible start your "home- 
making," by all means, with a comfortably furnished place. This is investment, 
not expense. Insofar as your purse permits fix your quarters up. Make no hesita- 
tion to patronize, if need be, the "installment house" of reliability. It is easier to pay 
a small sum, weekly or monthly, on goods bought and in use, rendering your life 
more comfortable and economical, than to try to "board" and at the same time set 
aside those same funds into a sum with w^hich to "set up later. 

Strain a point and attain this if you can. It saves money, nerves, health in 
the end, and yields comfort and content at once. 



Importance of Studying Household Questions 

(From Selection of Household Equipment, Year Book of Department of Agriculture) 

A generation ago such a subject might have been thought beneath the dignity 
of scientific investigation, but the last few years have seen a great change in this 
respect. The way in which our homes are run, or, in more technical terms, the 
science of home economics, is now in much the position that scientific agriculture 
was in twenty or thirty years ago. The leaders had then shown that science can 
improve crops, and some of the more progressive farmers were giving the new ideas 
a practical test, but many of the rank and file were still doubtful whether it was 
worth while. Few farmers of today, however, would care to go back to the days 
before experiment stations and fertilizer control. The fact that the problem of mak- 
ing the home as efficient as possible includes so many different kinds of questions 
will make necessary a great deal of study along many different lines, just as agricul- 
ture has included problems as different as those of insect pests and cheese-making. 
In solving these, every intelligent farmer, who has studied them on his own farm, has 
done his part as well as the special investigators in the laboratories. In the same way 
every intelligent housekeeper who studies the household problems of cooking, clean- 
ing and furnishing and tries to solve them with the help of both practical experience 
and scientific information hastens the day when household management can be as 
accurately planned as that of the factory and the farm. 

Planning and equipping a home in an accurate and systematic way does not 
mean that it should not have any individuality. On the contrary, while the prin- 
ciples which govern a wide choice of furnishings are the same for all kinds and con- 
ditions of houses and families, the articles actually chosen in accordance with these 
principles would vary just as much as the house and the families for which they are 
intended. Whether one's house is large or small, things should be chosen to fit act- 
ual needs, and to fill them in the way most economical of money, labor and materi- 
als, and as far as possible, to give pleasure as well. If the house or the family is 
large, different things will seem necessary, convenient, economical and suitable, 
from those which would answer the requirements if there were less space or fewer 
persons to be provided for. The size of the income also influences choice, but the 
fact that one cannot pay high prices does not mean that one must always put up 
with inconvenient and unattractive things. A table of easy-working height prob-

6 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— FURNITURE AND DECORATION 

ably costs no more than one too high or too low, nor would making wooden blocks 
to set under the legs of a low^ one be an impossible expense; yet a difference of a 
few inches may mean the difference between working easily and getting tired every 
day. Increasing the convenience of working by such simple means as moving a 
table or stove or rearranging the kitchen cupboards or kitchen cabinet may make a 
noticeable difference in the number of movements necessary for the daily ■work, and 
this saving of energy not only lessens the labor but also prevents the irritation which 
an intelligent person naturally feels at wasting effort. 

As far as the element of pleasure or beauty is concerned it is the necessary 
things rather than special ornaments which make the greatest difference in the 
attractiveness of the home. Comfortable furniture of good, plain design and har- 
monious colors on the walls and floors are more necessary to make a home restful 
and pleasant than many pictures and much bric-a-brac. Fortunately it need not cost 
any more to get these necessary things in satisfactory forms than in poor ones, 
though it may mean choosing more slowly and carefully. 

If the best equipped house is the one in which all its features and furnish- 
ings are most completely suited to the needs of the occupants, the standard for every 
family must be adapted to such individual peculiarities as the location of the house, 
the amount of the family income, the size of the family, and their different occupa- 
tions and interests. Judged by this standard, a woman who with limited means has 
made a convenient, comfortable and attractive home out of an unpromising, incon- 
venient farmhouse has shown greater ability than one who w^ith the help of an 
expensive decorator has obtained a good effect in a house equipped with all mod- 
ern improvements. 

Modem Housekeeping Appliances and Labor Savers. 

Indulge as liberally as you can in practical modern devices. Strain several 
points to include these in your equipment. They are doubly "investment." We 
cannot urge you too strongly to go in at once for many of the modern electric, 
gas (or oil) devices, vacuum or other cleaners — good ones — fireless and other spe- 
cial cookers and cooking utensils and kitchen and laundry and bath articles of merit. 

They save labor and time — which means that they add to your (or your 
employe's) actual money value — and to your own nerve and health value as a wife 
and companion, or mother. 



SELECTION OF HOUSEHOLD EQUIPMENT 

(Extracts from Bulletin of above title from 
Year Book of Department of Agriculture for 1914) 

In equipping her home, the housekeeper should be guided by the same prin- 
ciples that would be followed in the selection of equipment for any other workshop, 
and should choose furnishings and tools w^hich w^ill make it possible for her to carry 
on her various household tasks with the least w^aste of time, work and materials. 
A house should be equipped for efficiency in housework just as carefully as a mod- 
ern shoe factory is equipped for making shoes. In such a factory lighting, heating, 
ventilation, sanitation, etc., are as carefully considered as the machinery, and these 
matters of hygiene are even more important in the home, which is not merely a 
workshop but also a place in which to rest and recuperate. Since a home is even 
more than that, and serves also as the material setting for the life of the family, 
other points must be considered which have little or nothing to do with efficiency 
in a factory. It is certainly as important in a home to provide for comfort and 
wholesome enjoyment as for cooking and cleaning, eating and sleeping. 

Planning before Buying. 

Haphazard buying is always extravagant and nowhere more so than in con- 
nection with house furnishings. There is such a bewildering variety of things to be 
used in a house that, unless the housekeeper keeps a clear idea of what she wishes 
most and plans her buying carefully, she will find herself getting things which, 
though useful, are not the most useful, or are not the best adapted to her particular 
needs. 

In order to buy in accordance with a definite plan she must often steel her- 
self against the allurements of bargain counters or of beguiling salesmen, not be- 
cause the wares they offer are not intrinsically good or cheap, but because they may 
not be what she really needs most. In choosing labor-saving devices it is a good 
rule to give the preference to those which save heavy work and which lighten tasks 
most frequently performed. A machine for washing clothes saves more bodily 
energy than a patent roasting pan, and a meat chopper is used more often than a 
device for stoning cherries. 

But if a family really wishes its home to be something more than a place to 
eat and sleep in, it ought to plan as deliberately for increasing the production of 
comfortable and profitable leisure, pleasant social intercourse and an intelligent 
interest in things outside of its material needs as for mere food, clothing and shelter. 
Since we must have dishes to eat from, we might as well have them in attractive 
shapes and patterns and color, especially as good-looking ones do not necessarily 
cost more than others. The more any article that is used in the home includes all 
three elements of necessity, convenience and beauty, the more efficiently will it 
serve its purpose. 




Hou5ef)ofd]|/Scbec)ule 



Have a weekly program. Systematize your time, follow the system, and 
get more done in less time, and have your leisure together instead of in snatches. 

Lay out an outline for the week — to suit your own needs and conditions write it 

down. Lay out each day, so far as you can, in the same manner as the week. Do 
it mentally, if not on paper — but you follow it better if on paper. Adopt system. 



HOUSEHOLD ACCOUNTS 

Every housekeeper should "keep books." There is no better aid to thrift 
and economy than an absolute knowledge of what money goes for. It enables one 
to readjust, from month to month, cutting down on the less needful to supply the 
more essential without discomfort or real deprivation. Here is a simple and effect- 
ive household accounting system, with a page to illustrate it. 

Get a loose-leaf journal, or what is known as a "trial balance" book (six or 
more columns for figures), or use any blank book, ruling the columns yourself 
Write in the headings for the departments for the expenses of which you want to 
keep separate account, and make your entries daily in the "cash" columns. Once 
a week carry out the totals, or the separate items of the amounts, into the distribu- 
tion columns, that is, the department columns to which they belong. Once a month 
close the account and carry down your totals. You can see at a glance the cost of 
each housekeeping department. This enables you to compare the totals from month 
to month and the more intelligently rearrange your expenditures.

HOME MANAGEMENT 

(From Bulletin under the above title issued by Iowa State College of Agriculture) 



DIVISION OF INCOME 

A. It has been estimated that from one-fourth to 
one-third of the income may be saved by 
scientific management. Bullock has estimated 
that at least one-fifth of money spent for food 
is actually wasted. 

1. By buying needlessly expensive materials. 

2. By careless storing of goods. 

3. By failure to select according to season. 

4. By waste. 

5. By poor preparation of food. 

6. By badly constructed ovens. 

B. If the home maker would conduct her business 

along the lines suggested, by careful study of 
good business principles, she would probably 
find that she was running her home in a better 
way at less cost. 

C. Suggestions for division of income. 

1. Knowledge of Amount of Income. 

a. Salary. 

b. Average income when not salary. 

2. Use of Budget. 

"A budget is a detailed plan of anticipated in- 
come and expenditures for some definite future 
period of time, as a week, month or year; it is 
intended to control expenditures during that pe- 
riod." 

"A budget is a finacial plan for the future." 

3. Factors which will influence budget. 

a. Size of income. 

b. Size of family. 

c. Locality of home. 

4. Suggested Division (for average income) 

a. Food (257p). 

b. Clothing (20%). 

c. Rent or taxes and repairs (15%). 

d. Operating expenses ( I 5%) 

Renewal of equipment 

Emergencies 

Help 

e. Higher Life (15%) 

Education 

Religion 

Recreation 

f. Saving (10%) 

Money in Bank 
Investments 
Life Insurance 



The division just suggested will be fairly satis- 
factory for the family having an income of from 
$1,000 to $1,200 a year. As the income increases 
or decreases, the proportions spent in these various 
ways will be changed. 

5. Success in Division of Income Depends 
upon: 

a. Knowledge of textiles. 

b. Ability to make and repair gar- 

ments. 

c. Good taste concerning color, design 

and material for dress and home 
decoration. 

d. Knowledge of laundry work. 

e. Knowledge of food values. 

f. Knowledge of food preparation. 

g. Ability to plan meals. 

h. A thorough knowledge of personal 
hygiene. 

i. Understanding of symptoms of dis- 
ease and knowledge of home 
nursing. 
Knowledge of disinfectants and 
cleansers. 



J- 



( I ) In care of sick, 

(2) In disease. 

(3) In care of bathroom fix- 

tures. 

(4) In care of vaults and earth 

closets. 

(5) In care of closets. 

(6) In care of cellar. 

(7) In care of refrigerator. 

(8) In care of food materials. 

k. Knowledge of wood finish and care 
of equipment. 

1. Good taste concerning pictures. 

m. Good taste and good judgment con- 
cerning furniture. 

n. Good judgment concerning choice 
of books and magazines. 

A study of these fourteen elements of success in- 
dicates that the home-maker who hopes to make a 
genuine success of her business must have a thor- 
ough working knowledge of: 



Food 

Personal Hygiene 

Care of Children 

Home Nursing 

Textiles 



Home Decoration 
Home Art 
Good Pictures 
Good Literature 
Good Music 



Laundry Work

upon the amount of money spent as upon the good 
taste and good judgment that prompt the spending.

CARE OF FURNITURE 



To Polish Furniture (Cornell Reading Course) 

— Apparatus; a bottle of furniture polish, a small 
handful of cotton waste, and one or two flannel- 
ette dusters or old soft cloths. 

Take a piece of the cotton waste or an old soft 
cloth, put some polish on it and rub it on the wood. 
Use as little polish as possible, but rub hard to re- 
move dirt and scratches. Rub with the grain of 
the wood. 

Take the rest of the cotton waste and rub as 
much of the polish as possible off the piece of 
furniture. 

Polish finally with the flannelette, rubbing briskly 
but lightly until the surface is bright and there is 
no appearance of oiliness. Be especially careful to 
rub out corners. 

Burn all the cotton waste. Be careful about this 
because oily cotton has often caused a fire through 
its spontaneous combustion. 

Put away the polish bottle, wiping the outside 
carefully. Wash the dusters and hang them up to 
dry. 

Recipe for Furniture Polish — (Cornell Reading 

Course) Take 8 oz. linseed oil, ^/i pint vinegar, 

Yl °z- alcohol, Yl °z. butter of antimony, J/j oz. 
muriatic acid. Mix the ingredients thoroughly, 
and Keep in a closely corked bottle. This polisn 
should not be used on pianos. 

Other Simple Ways to Polish Furniture — Home- 
made polishes may be made to work wonders, even 
when the wood has been without attention for a 
long time. 

Only the thinnest kind of polishes should be 
used on highly varnished surfaces: the object is 
only to clean, without injuring, what is almost an 
enamel. 

There are times when soap and water should be 
used, but before these are put on, polish or its oils 
should be rubbed in so the water will not dull the 
surface; otherwise washing may permanently dam- 
age the surface. 

Olive oil is less likely to be sticky, hence, should 
waxing prove too difficult, it may be substituted. 

An excellent furniture polish is made of equal 
parts of boiled linseed oil, vinegar and methylated 
spirits. 



A combination of beer and beeswax is recom- 
mended by an English authority, who says that first 
the wood must be washed and dried, then there 
should be ready a quart of beer in which has been 
boiled long enough to blend a piece of beeswax the 
size of a pigeon's egg and tablespoonful of sugar, 
this mixture being allowed to cook but not to get 
cold before being put on with a soft furniture 
brush. The liquid dries on and is then polished off 
with a soft cloth. 

It is useless to merely polish over dirt or grease; 
when these are present use soap and water. 

There is no simpler way of treating varnished 
mahogany, oak or walnut, than with vinegar and 
oil, the vinegar being the cleanser. The ingredi- 
ents may be used in one of two vrays: by mixing 
the two in the proportion of one-third vinegar and 
two-thirds olive oil or linseed oil, shaking vigor- 
ously and rubbing on with a soft cloth, afterwards 
polishing with a dry rag; or by using the vinegar 
first and later the oil clear, applying each with a 
different cloth. 

Waxing — Mahogany or old walnut has a "soft" 
or wax finish and should always be kept in a state 
of luster. For a smooth surface, such as a table 
top, white wax is best, but it takes time and muscle 
to put on. The top should be made quite clean and 
then shaved wax rubbed in with the palm of the 
hand until all has disappeared and the top has an 
even and high finish. This is the most difficult of 
all polishing that can be done at home, but pays in 
the end, for the surface keeps better, requires scrub- 
bing less often and always looks bright. Every few 
days, after being wiped over with a soft cloth, it 
should be rubbed again with the hand to polish. 
Wax need not be put on oftener than once in three 
weeks after the luster has been attained. At first 
once a week will not be too often. 

To use oil as a polish for a dining table is a mis- 
take, for no matter how carefully the unguent is 
rubbed in some will remain on the surface, and this 
will eventually stain the linen. 

Scratches on Varnished Furniture Remove from 

varnished surfaces by going over carefully with a 
camel's hair brush that has been dipped in shellac 
varnish until they disappear. Nothing should touch 
the places until they are quite dry.

THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Section I.— GENERAL HOUSEHOLD 



Bruises on Furniture — Soak a large piece of 
brown paper in cold water for a few seconds; have 
ready some very hot irons. Place the folded paper 
over the bruised place in the wood and then iron 
over it. Repeat this process until the wood is 
swollen. Let the wrood dry for an hour or so and 
then polish in the usual manner. 

To Clean a Piano Case (Cornell Reading 

Course) Apparatus: a bottle of olive oil, some 

new or perfectly clean canton flannel, a perfectly 
clean chamois leather and a basin of water. 

Wet a small piece of the flannel and drop on it 
a fe^v drops of oil. 

Rub, with the wet flannel, a small section of the 
case at a time, and immediately rub it thoroughly 
with a dry piece of the flannel before proceeding 
to a fresh section. 

Polish finally with the chamois or a fresh piece 
of the flannel. Rub with the grain of the wood and 
breathe on it occasionally to help remove the oili- 
ness, if any may remain. A very little flour rubbed 
with the grain of the wood will also help to remove 
oiliness, but its use should not be necessary. 

Wash the piano keys with a corner of the flannel 
wet with alcohol. Be careful, however, to avoid 
touching the wood with the alcohol, as it will ruin 
the varnish. 

Piano Keys — When yellow, clean piano keys, as 
well as all ivory articles, with alcohol, rubbed on 
with muslin. If very yellow, use flannel moistened 
with cologne water. 

To Mend Leaking Vase — Melt some paraffine and 
run it over the defective portion or side. As hot 
water, which would melt the paraffine, is not used 
in a vase for flowers, this remedy is perfectly satis- 
factory. 

Gilt Frames Wipe the frames gently with a piece 

of sponge dampened ^vith spirits of wine or oil of 
turpentine, and allow them to dry of themselves. 
If white of egg is applied with a small camel's hair 
brush to fly specks on gilt frames, then rubbing 
gently with a soft cloth, the specks will disappear. 

Marble To clean marble, take two parts com- 
mon soda, one part pumice stone, and one part 
finely powdered salt. Sift the mixture through a fine 
sieve and niix it with water, then rub it well over 
the marble and stains will be removed. Rub then 
with salt and water. Wash off and wipe dry. 

To polish black marble rub over with olive oil 
and finish with a clean chamois leather. 

Or: Clean Marble with slices of lemon dipped 
in salt; leave for an hour, then wash off with soft 
cloth and tepid water. 

Sagged Cane Chairs Cane seated chairs that 

have sagged can be tightened in the following 
njanner. Wash them in hot water and soap and 
rinse in clear water. Dry in the open air. 

Leather Furniture — Chairs and couches uphols- 
tered in leather will last much longer if the follow- 



ing mixture is applied once a month: One part 
good vinegar, two parts boiled linseed oil. Shake 
thoroughly together. Apply a little on a soft rag 
and polish with a silk duster or piece of chamois. 
This cleanses and softens the leather; it is also a 
good polish for the wood if applied thereto as well. 
Another good method: Wet the leather first with 
a little hot milk. Then after melting some bees- 
wax in hot water add to it enough turpentine to 
give it the consistency of a thin cream. Put this 
mixture on the leather covers and then polish them 
^vith a soft cloth. Sometimes milk alone is sufE- 
cient. Dust the leather thoroughly, first. 

Brass Polish — This is quite easy to make at home. 
Put 1 ounce soft soap, I ounce ammonia, I ounce 
rottenstone, in a jug. Pour on one pint boiling 
water and mix thoroughly. Some prefer the juice 
of a lenion instead of ammonia. Bottle when cold 
and keep tightly corked. 

A brilliant polish may be given to door fixtures, 
ornaments, etc., by washing them in alum and lye. 
Make a solution by boiling an ounce of alum in a 
pint of lye and wash the article in it. Sweet oil and 
powdered rottenstone vigorously applied with a 
piece of soft flannel will clean brass ornamented 
pieces. 

To Clean Nickel — (Cornell Reading Course) — 
Apparatus; a bottle of ammonia, a tablespoonful 
of ^vhiting in a small bowl, a sniall woolen cloth, 
and a larger woolen cloth or flannelette duster. 

Stir enough household ammonia into the whiting 
to make a thin paste, as thick as milk. Rub the 
paste over the nickel, rubbing it well into crevices. 
When dry, rub the whiting off and polish with the 
dry woolen cloth. If stains still remain, it will be 
necessary to scour them off with sapolio or sonie- 
thing similar. 

Note: — When nickel on a stove has been neg- 
lected and is very dirty, it is often easier to clean 
the pieces after they have been unscrewed and 
taken off; but it is necessary to look after all the 
bolts and screws carefully and see that all are put 
back in their proper places. 

Nickel Polish — Equal parts ammonia and whit- 
ing make an excellent mixture for cleaning nickel 
furniture and ornaments. It should be applied to 
the nickel with a cloth and will produce a good 
luster. 

Cleaning Copper — Mix half a cup of flour, half 
a cup of vinegar and two tablespoons salt. It is a 
little harmful to the hands, but you can avoid dip- 
ping your fingers into it by using a big sponge, 
dipping only a corner of the sponge, leaving the 
rest dry, or by using a rag in the same manner. 
Rub lightly if you would have the best results. Be 
sure to dip the article into cold water quickly and 
dry thoroughly, otherwise it will become green. 



GENERAL HOUSEHOLD— HOUSEHOLD HELPS

Cleaning Gold — Gold and gilt articles may be 
effectively cleaned by washing them in ordinary 
soap and water, and while wet transferring them to 
a bag containing some clean, fresh bran or sa^vdust, 
shaking well for a few minutes. 

To Fasten Loose Chair Rung — Split the end of 
the rung slightly and insert the end of a small 
wooden wedge, then press the rung tightly in place. 
The harder you press the more the wedge spreads 
the end of the rung until it becomes impossible to 
remove it. 

Pianos Catch Cold — exactly as we do. They get 
hoarse or have a cough or stiff note or some other 
similar complaint which cannot be cured by home 
remedies but require tedious and expensive doctor- 
ing. In order to prevent these avoidable ailments 



a piano should be kept in a moderately warm room 
where the temperature is even — say, sixty or sev- 
enty degrees, the year round, not cold one day and 
hot the next The instrument should not, however, 
be too near the source of heat. It should be kept 
closed and covered with a felt cloth when not in use 
for some time, particularly in frosty weather. Al- 
ways place the piano close to but not against an 
inside wall. 

A Little Duster — It is difficult to keep wicker fur- 
niture and certain other furniture properly dusted. 
Buy a five-cent dish-washing mop, saturate it with 
crude oil or cedar oil and allow it to dry. The 
result is a dustless duster that gets into every 
crevice, is useful for many kinds of dusting and 
does not soil the hands.

FLOORS AND FLOOR COVERINGS 



To Dust Hardwood Floors — (Cornell Reading 
Course) — Apparatus: a string mop. A dustless 
mop may be used. 

Dampen the string mop if the floor is not a 
waxed one. It may be sprinkled as clothes are for 
ironing, or may be held in the steam of a tea kettle, 
but it must not be damp enough to show wet on the 
floor. 

Co over the floor assigned, being careful that 
every board is rubbed. It is probably better to rub 
along the boards than across them. 

Take especial care to go under tables, desks and 
like furniture, moving them when necessary. 

Wash out the mop with soap and water when 
necessary. Rinse thoroughly, wring dry, and shake 
out well to make it as fluffy as possible. Hang to 
dry in the fresh air, or in a warm place, with the 
head up. 

To Mop a Floor (Cornell Reading Course) — 

Apparatus: mopping pail, mop, mop wringer, 
soap solution and hot water. 

Fill the pail three-quarters full of hot water, add 
one-half cup of soap solution, and carry it to the 
rooni assigned. 

Clear the floor of the room as far as possible. 

Dip the mop in the pail, drain without wringing, 
wet one section of the floor, and rub it clean. Rinse 
the mop in the pail, wring it tightly, and dry the 
wet section thoroughly before proceeding to wet 
another. It may be necessary to rinse the mop 
several times. 

Begin at one corner of the room and work to- 
ward the door. Change the water when necessary. 

Wash and rinse the mop, wring it tightly, and 
hang it head up to dry in the fresh air if possible. 

Empty the pail, rinse pail and wringer before 
putting them away, and leave the tub clean. 

To Wax a Floor — (Cornell Reading Course) — 
Apparatus: the can of floor wax, a waxing flannel, 
a half yard of heavy flannel or a piece of old 
brussels carpet, and a weighted brush. 

The floor must be clean and free from dust. 

If necessary, stand the wax dish or can in a dish 
of hot water in order to soften the wax. 

Rub the waxing flannel on the wax and put on 
a very thin, even layer of wax to the floor. Start 
at the corner farthest from the door and do not 
step on the waxed part. 

Put away the wax and flannel, and keep ofl the 
floor for at least three hours. The polishing can 
be done after standing an hour, but is more work. 

Fold the piece of heavy flannel twice, making 
four layers, put it down on the floor, put the 
weighted brush on it, and rub each board, with the 
grain, until it shines. The piece of carpet makes 
an excellent substitute for the flannel. The polish- 



ing can be done on the hands and knees without a 
weighted brush, but is much harder work. 

To Keep Carpets Bright — Sweep occasionally 
with a broom dipped in water to which a little tur- 
pentine has been added. Carpets will stay bright 
and moths will not infest them. 

To Clean a Carpet — Mix together in a bottle 
equal quantity of turpentine and ammonia. Put 
two tablespoonfuls of this into a quart of water, 
and with this sponge the carpet, after carefully 
brushing it. Only wash a small piece of the carpet 
at a time; do not wet it too much; rub it dry 
with a cloth. 

To Avoid Modu — If powdered borax is put 
around the edge of a carpet it will keep away 
moths. 

To Prevent Carpet Bugs — Fill a sewing machine 
oil can or bulb spray with turpentine. Scatter the 
turpentine freely by means of this in the closets, the 
corners and places where these pests are likely to 
be found. 

To Mend Rugs — To patch a hole in a rug, lay 
a piece of woolen under it as a patch, and with a 
large embroidery needle darn cotton in harmoniz- 
ing colors over the woolen. It is often possible 
thus to cover a large hole so it ^vill not show. 
Threads drawn from an old brussels carpet can be 
used for mending a woolen rug. 

When Rugs Slip — Sew a strip of rubber on the 
underside at each end to grip the polished floor. 

Rug Beater — A discarded tennis racquet may be 
put to use, being light and strong and so con- 
structed that it does not destroy the goods. Re- 
move all the cords, keeping only the frame. 

To Swreep Matting Sprinkle the matting with 

Indian meal and then sweep it thoroughly, sweep- 
ing out the meal and the dirt with it. 

To Clean Matting — The matting should be beat- 
en to remove all dust. Take it out of doors and 
scrub it ^vell with bran ^vater, or with water to 
which a small quantity of salt has been added. 
Soap has a tendency to turn matting yellow, so 
should not be used. Rinse with cold water, rub dry 
as possible with a clean cloth, and hang on a line 
to complete drying. 

Linoleum — The following polish gives a good 
gloss without making linoleum the least bit slip- 
pery: One gill methylated spirit, one pound shellac; 
mix together, and when the shellac is thoroughly 
dissolved apply to linoleum with a soft flannel and 
the gloss will remain even after the linoleum is 
washed. When linoleum begins to show wear. 



GENERAL HOUSEHOLD— FLOOR AND FLOOR COVERINGS 



17 



paint the surface with good quality floor varnish 
and allow it a longer time to dry than would be 
necessary for a wood Boor. 

Inexpensive Floor Polish — Take one sperm can- 
dle and melt, remove from stove and add one pint 
coal oil. Use with a flannel rag. This makes a 
good floor polish and answers the same purpose as 
many bought polishes. £qual parts of coal oil 
(kerosene) and linseed oil warmed and used to 
rub on hardwood floors will make them look like 
new. 

A Cheap Floor Stain — Dissolve two ounces of 
permanganate of potash in two quarts boiling 
water; if too dark add more water until desired 
shade is obtained. Apply with a flat brush; let dry 
over night and rub with boiled linseed oil or 
varnish. 

Grease Spots on Floors — Do not put hot water 
on new grease spots on floors; the water makes 
the grease "set in." Use cold water and soap or 
soap-powder. 

To Polish Floors and Wood^vork with Kerosene 

— (Cornell Reading Course) — Apparatus: The 
kerosene can, the kerosene plate, a kerosene mitt, 
a handful cotton waste or an old soft cloth, and a 
soft woolen or flannelette cloth. 

Put a very thin layer of kerosene in the plate and 
dip the mitt into it. 

Rub a portion of the wood hard with the mitt, 
being careful to clean out the corners thoroughly. 
Immediately rub as much kerosene off the section 
as possible with the cotton waste or old cloth. Then 
proceed to clean the next section. 

When all the wood has been cleaned and the 
first section has stood for an hour, polish it finally 
with the woolen cloth. It will be all the better to 
stand three or four hours before the polishing. 

Put away the kerosene, mitt, plate and can, and 
burn the waste. 

Wash the polishing cloth in strong soapsuds, 
rinse carefully, and hang it to dry. 



Note In all wood polishing, rub with the grain 

of the wood. 

To Clean Woodwork — (Cornell Reading Course) 
— Apparatus: A fiber tub, two flannelette dusters, 
borax, and warm water. 

Put a level teaspoonful of borax into the tub and 
fill the tub with warm water. The water should be 
comfortably warm. 

Wash a section of the woodwork with one dus- 
ter, and immediately rub dry with the other dus- 
ter before proceeding to the next section. 

When two do this work together, better pro- 
gress is made when one washes and the other dries 
the wood. A step-ladder is necessary for high 
\voodwork. 

When all the wood is cleaned, wash out the 
dusters carefully and hang them up to dry. 

Note A steel wire brush, such as is used by 

painters, will expedite the cleaning out of corners 
and angles when the woodwork has been badly 
neglected. 

To Dust Woodwork — (Cornell Reading Course) 
— Apparatus: One or more damp flannelette dust- 
ers. 

Begin at one corner of the room and dust the 
baseboard of Mrainscoting. Do the doors and 
windows as they come. 

Use the dusters to wipe up the dust and do not 
shake them about. When one duster becomes 
dusty enough to be dirty, take another. Co over 
every board of the woodwork, and be careful not 
to slur over the corners but to take all the dust out 
of them. 

When dusting stairways it may be necessary to 
use a long-handled cornice brush in order to reach 
all parts. 

Woodwork with many panels is easily dusted 
with a woolly stove-mitt, which is kept for the pur- 
pose. 

Wash out the dusters with soap and water and 
hang them up to dry.

GENERAL HOUSEHOLD— WALLS AND WALL-PAPER 



19 



WALLS AND WALL-PAPER 



Cleaning Walls — (Cornell Reading Course) — 
Apparatus: A cornice brush. 

Close all the doors of the room, and cover pic- 
tures and other articles. 

If the room has a cornice, brush the dust out 
carefully. 

Brush first the ceiling, then the walls. Brush 
gently so as to gather the dust on the brush rather 
than to scatter it. 

Shake the brush well, and then put it away. 

Remove the covers from the pictures and the 
other articles gently, carry the covers outside to 
shake, and fold them before putting away. 

Enameled Walls — Wring out a soft flannel in 
tepid water to which has been added a little kero- 
sene. Wipe the enameled surface with this quickly, 
exchanging the cloth for a clean one often. Do 
not scrub: wipe lightly. You will be amazed at 
the quantity of dirt that will come off on the flan- 
nel. Do not smear the wood. Work one direc- 
tion all the time, changing water as it gets dirty. 

Soda for Cleaning Walls — Use two pails tepid 
water. Wet a cloth and sprinkle a little baking 
soda on it, wash a space that can be easily reached. 
Rinse with clear water and wipe dry. Use the soda 
sparingly. 

Smoked Wall — Co over wall first with lime 
water before putting on a coat of paint. One coat 
will be sufficient with this treatment: five cents of 
lime dissolved in a pail of water and put on quickly 
with a whitewash brush. 

Putty — When using putty for filling in very wide 
cracks, the inexperienced person finds it very diffi- 
cult to spread it evenly. To prevent it from crum- 
bling, dip the knife in coal oil. 

To Drive a Nail in Plaster — Put the nail in very 
hot water until it is thoroughly heated. Leave it 
wet, and you can drive it in clean without breaking 
or chipping the plaster. 

Holes in Walls — Holes in walls can be stopped 
with plaster of paris, but mix this with vinegar in- 
stead of water, or it will harden so quickly it will 
be difficult to manipulate. 



To Tighten Picture Nails — Saturate a bit of wad- 
ding with a thick glue, wrap as much as possible 
around the nail, and reinsert the latter in the hole, 
pressing it home as strongly as possible. The nail 
will be held firmly in its place. 

Scratches on Wall-Paper — If wall-paper is 
scratched or rubbed, moisten a scrap of the paper 
that is saved, carefully scrape off the coloring mat- 
ter with thin knife-blade; apply this to spot. When 
dry the spot will be hid. You could never match 
up other coloring matter so well. 

To Mend Crack in Wall-Paper — ^Tear out by 
hand a piece of paper like that on the wall, a little 
larger than the hole or crack, and starch well. Use 
a caster to roll the edges. Be sure to tear out patch 
by hand; with knife or scissors the patch will show, 
but put on in this way the patch cannot be de- 
tected. 

Varnished Wall-Paper — Varnished wall-paper 
may be wiped with a mixture of paraffin and warm 
water. Half-pint paraffin to a bucket of water. 
Use a soft flannel cloth, wrung fairly dry, and pol- 
ish with a piece of cheesecloth. 

Grease Stains on Wall-Paper — To remove, mix 
pipe-clay with water to the consistency of cream, 
spread over the marks, allow to remain for two 
days, then remove with a stiff brush and the stains 
will have disappeared. 

Ordinarily wall-papers may be cleaned with 
dough, or rubbed with a dry cloth only. 

To Remove Wall-Paper from Walls — Use a white- 
wash brush and a pail of warm water and get a 
paper scraper, which can be purchased at five-and- 
ten-cent stores. Dip tip of brush in water and go 
over wall quickly so as to keep water as much as 
possible from running to floor. Get over the entire 
side of wall with wet brush, let paper stand a few 
minutes, then go over it again and scrape with 
scraper. Sometimes after paper is thoroughly 
soaked you can take hold and strip the most of it 
off. If papers are pulpy you have to scrape them 
all off. When one side is partly off wet another, 
keeping it well soaked ahead of you.

GENERAL HOUSEHOLD— CURTAINS. SHADES, CUSHIONS 



21 



CURTAINS, SHADES, CUSHIONS 



Window Curtains — It is never a mistake to 
select neat lawn, scrim, net, muslin or linen for 
window curtains. They should come to the sill 
and may be any length hanging from the top, from 
the middle sash, a quarter from the top, anywhere 
deemed best. 

If the casing is very narrow, the rod on which 
they are hung should be placed below the brackets 
(or the shades, so that the shades can be pulled 
over the curtains to the room side. The curtains 
can be shirred on a rod with or without a rume 
above. 

They may hang straight, as at casements always, 
or they may be held in place at the bottom by a 
similar rod, as on French windows. 

A Short-Cut in Curtains — So many housekeepers 
use dotted Swiss for sash curtains that this plan 
for saving some yards of Swiss will be welcomed: 

The average windovtr requires two yards of Swiss 
one yard wide. One and a half yards used with 
selvage top and bottom instead of at the sides saves 
half a yard on each window. Besides this, not only 
is the money saved but time is saved in making. 

Turn a hem at the top that is just large enough 
to cover the rod and make as large a hem at the 
bottom as the window will allov*^; the curtains, also, 
always hang straight. 

To Keep Curtains Clean — In bedrooms where the 
curtains hang straight from the poles and where 
the windows are open at night, sew a brass ring on 
the side of each curtain and put a screw eye up 
high enough on the side of the casing so by loop- 
ing up the curtains they are kept cleaner and are 
less mussed, also let in more air. Take off the 
rings when the curtains are washed. 

To Clean Tapestry Curtains — Take the curtains 
down, brush them well and then rub all spots and 
soiled parts with magnesia. Hang these out on a 
line on a fine, windy day: finally shake them. 

Cleaning Window Shades — After the summer 
light-colored window shades are usually soiled and 



often fly-specked. Remove the latter by rubbing 
lightly with the very finest sandpaper. Then clean 
by rubbing very gently with a soft cloth wrung out 
of a mixture of one pint hot water and three table- 
spoonfuls of benzine (keeping the benzine away 
from the fire). Dry by wiping with a clean, soft 
cloth. 

To Dust Window Shades — (Cornell Reading 
Course) — Apparatus: A step-ladder and a flannel- 
ette duster. 

Place the ladder firmly so that it is easy to reach 
the spring end of the roller. 

Roll the shade up as far as possible and take it 
down from the window. If it will not roll all the 
way up before you take it down, roll it up before 
coming down from the ladder; otherwise the shade 
is likely to wrinkle and be damaged. 

Unroll carefully over a table or out on the floor. 
Great care must be taken to prevent the shade from 
wrinkling. 

Roll up slowly, dusting each side as it is rolled. 

Replace the shade on the window, and test to see 
whether it rolls up and down properly. If it does 
not roll quickly to the middle of the window, take 
it off again and roll it up before replacing. If it 
will not pull down to the bottom, pull it down as far 
as possible, take it off again, and unroll it to the 
length of the window before replacing. 

Dust the middle ledge of the window before tak- 
ing away the step-ladder. 

To Renew Window Shades — Old window shades 
may be painted and will look like new. Lay them 
on the floor on newspaper and paint one side. 
When dry, paint the other. They may be painted 
white on the outside and green on the inside. The 
paint covers all cracks and worn places. 

Sofa Cushions Cut a roll of cotton in small 

squares and heat in a pan in the oven, leaving it 
there for half an hour. Do not let the cotton 
scorch. Every square will swell to twice its size and 
will be light and fluffy for filling for cushions.

Simple Terms In Electricity 

Electrical terms have puzzled many housekeepers since the use of the cur- 
rent has become common for cooking as well as cleaning and lighting. 

Electric current is like a stream of water. The size of the steam may vary 
as do water pipes, and the word used to designate the size of an electric stream is 
ampere. Thus, an electric iron requires a large stream, five amperes; a vacuum 
cleaner a smaller stream, one ampere; while a large range with all the switches on 
will require a still larger stream and may take from fifteen to twenty amperes. 
Thus, only the devices requiring five amperes and under are safe to use on the 
lighting circuit, which carries only that comparatively small-sized stream. 

Another common term is the volt. This means the pressure of the stream 
of electricity. With the water supply we speak of the pressure at the faucets as 
thirty pounds or sixty pounds, etc. With electricity we speak of the pressure as 
1 I volts or I 20 volts, etc. Thus the voltage or pressure is determined by your 
local electric company, while the manufacturer decides the size of the stream or 
amperage required for his device. 

The volt is the actual amount of electricity used. It is measured by gallons 
or cubic feet in the case of water. Thus we would say that the faucet runs fifty 
gallons an hour, while with electricity we would say the iron consumes five hun- 
dred watts an hour. Because the watt is so small a quantity, all electric lighting 
companies use one thousand watts or the kilowatt as their basis of measurement, 
and the cost of electricity is therefore so many cents for a kilowatt used one hour. 
Once these terms are understood it will be a simple matter for any housekeeper to 
determine the exact cost of using any one of her electrical appliances. This method is cor- 
rect for the less common direct current (D.C. ) and approximately correct for the oftener 
used alternating current (A.C.). Multiply the pressure or voltage, by the size of the stream, 
or the amperage, and you have the amount of electricity used, or the watts. Thus an iron 
stating on the name-plate "110 volts, 5 amperes," uses 550 watts and costs at a ten cents 
a kilowatt-hour rate just five and one-half cents an hour to run it. At a five cent rate it costs 

23 



24 



THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK — Section II.— GENERAL UTILITY 



approximately three cents for the same service. On all electric appliances you will find the 
volts and amperes plainly stated. 

Most household users of electricity have an unreasoning fear of "blown fuse" when 
really they should consider the fuse in an electrical system like the safety valve in the steam 
boiler. If anything goes wrong the fuse "blows" automatically turning off the current. This 
is accomplished by means of a small wire within the fuse which melts with some slight noise 
which is called "blowing." When you have blown a fuse, do not be frightened, for the 
safety-valve has worked and no harm has been done. Notify the company and a new fuse 
will be put in. Find out the cause of the trouble. Remember that a fuse must be large 
enough to carry the largest stream of electricity that you expect to use at one time, and state 
very clearly to the repair man sent to you all the electric devices you were using at the 
time the fuse blew. Thus, if the toaster and percolator, each consuming five amperes, to- 
gether with the dining-room lights, were all in operation and the chafing-dish consuming 
another five amperes was then started, a blown fuse would immediately result provided the 
fuse was a fifteen ampere one, because the stream of electricity would be too large and the 
safety-valve would "blow," while if the fuse had been a twenty-five ampere one, there 
would have been no necessity for the safety-valve to operate. Be very sure, however, that 
the fuse is not larger than the stream of electricity the wiring can carry safely. 



THE CARE OF LINENS 

It pays to have more bed linen than just enough 
for a change. Your linens will stay in good con- 
dition longer and you will enjoy the pleasure of 
using well-aired, sweet sheets and pillow cases 
from your linen closet, instead of having to put 
on your bed those just returned from the laundry 
with more or less of a laundry odor. 

There must be extra linens, too, for guests or 
sickness; but without order in the closet there will 
be little satisfaction in the good supply. To pre- 
vent the wear and tear being too great on certain 
pieces, use the pieces from the top of the piles, 
slipping those just returned from the laundry to 
the bottom of the piles. 

To keep tab on your laundry supply tack up in 
your closet a list of what you have and what you 
send out each week. The articles being arranged 
in neat piles can be counted almost at a glance 
when the laundry is returned. In a large estab- 
lishment the supply for each room or floor must be 
kept on separate shelves or in separate closets. 

Scent for Linens. — English lavender is the only 
proper scent for bed linens, as it is soothing to the 
sleeper as well as sweet smelling and delicious to 
the nostrils. It is not appropriate for any than bed 
linens, however. 

THE DAILY DUSTING 
(Cornell Reading Course) 

Apparatus: a cheesecloth duster, a slightly damp 
flannelette duster, a string mop, and (if the room 
has a rug or carpet) the carpet sweeper. 

Air the room, if necessary. 

Sweep the rug or carpet with the sweeper. 

Dust any bare floor with the string mop. 



Dust the windov^^ glass, window ledges, and all 
outstanding of wainscoting, cupboards, and the 
like, with the flannelette duster, and the chairs, 
tables and smaller articles with the finer one. 

Use the dusters to wipe up the dust, and do not 
shake them about. When one duster becomes 
dirty, take another. 

Wipe finger marks from electric-light button 
plates. 

When dusting stairways it may be necessary to 
use the long-handled cornice brush. 

Avoid letting soiled dusters rest on beds, up- 
holstered furniture, or on brass or metal parts, and 
like places. 

Be careful to replace desk papers exactly as they 
were found. 

Arrange the window shades before leaving the 
room. 

Empty dust, and put away the carpet sweeper. 
Put away the string mop, washing it if necessary. 
Wash the dusters and hang them up to dry. 

Dustless dusters and mops may be used instead 
of dampened ones. 



THE CUPBOARD OR CLOSET 

Cleaning (Cornell Reading Course). — Appa- 
ratus; a dishpan, a scrub cloth, a clean duster and 
a dry sink towel. 

Fill the pan half full of soapy water, comfortably 
warm. 

Clean the top shelf. Dust each article and place 
on a lower shelf or other convenient place. Wash 
the shelf and wipe dry with the sink towel. Re- 
place each article belonging to the shelf. 

Clean the remaining shelves, cleaning the bot- 
tom one last.

Closet Hanging Space. — A small closet will hold 
twice as much clothing without crushing if a small 
pole is fastened from end to end and a few inches 
below shelf, along which you may slip a number 
of hangers upon which suits and dresses may be 
neatly hung. Many more hangers may be sus- 
pended from the pole than could be crowded on 
hooks: besides you still have the hook space at 
back and ends if the closet is not too close; the 
clothing on the hangers does not get so crushed. 

BED AND BEDROOM SUGGESTIONS 

Dresser Drawers that stick need paraffin or soap 
on the sliding parts. Paraffin will rub off less; it 
works into the wood and keeps it smooth. 

Never Sun Feather Beds or Pillows. Air them 
thoroughly on a windy day in a cool place. Sun 
draws the oil and gives feathers a rancid odor. 

All Mattresses, u.sed either by children or 
adults, should be well brushed once a fortnight. 
Put in the sun by open windows when possible. 
In this way the white dust which comes from the 
body is disposed of and mattress disinfected. 

Or, better still, make a covering as you would 
for a pillow case out of heavy unbleached sheeting, 
to fit mattress; close the end by sewing buttons and 
buttonholes. This covering can be removed from 
time to time and laundered; it should be starched 
stifl to prevent dust from sifting through. It will 
keep the mattress nice and new. Mattresses, at 
that, should be brushed and aired when the cover 
is removed. 

Cleaning Brass Beds — Wring out a bit of flannel 
almost dry in sewing machine oil and go over the 
bedstead daintly. It will not dull the lustre, and it 
will remove flyspecks. 

Never touch the brass without having a cloth 
bet^veen your hands and the polished brass; the 
perspiration of the hand will tarnish it and form 
verdigris. 

Never hang clothing you have taken from your 
body across the brass rails. Dust all parts of the 
bedstead once or twice a week at least. 

To renovate a shabby brass bedstead, or one of 
iron and brass, wash it with soap and water, and 
when it is quite dry, clean the brass parts with metal 
polish, polishing them well with a soft velvet dus- 
ter. Now varnish all over, both iron and brass, 
^vith a transparent varnish. 

Such a varnish may be made as follows: Put six 
ounces bleached shellac and one pint methylated 
spirit in a bottle, and stand it to one side for a day 
or two until it is dissolved, shaking it occasionally. 
Cork tightly. Keep away from fire. Apply with a 
soft brush. 

CLEANING THE BATHROOM 
Cleaning Bathroom — (Cornell Reading Course) 
— Apparatus: Closet brush, scrub cloth, dry flan- 
nelette duster and string mop. 



Clean the bathtub. Let in a little very hot water, 
rub soap on the scrub brush, and wash all scum 
deposits from the tub. Rinse out the tub and wash 
the taps. See that the outside is clean, and wipe 
everything dry with the duster. 

Clean the closet. Raise the cover and the wooden 
seat. Wash the bowl thoroughly with the closet 
brush. If necessary scrub above the water line 
with soap, and see that the outside is clean. Flush 
the bowl. Wash the seat inside and out, also the 
inside of the cover. If necessary, wash the floor- 
slab. Wipe everything dry with the duster. 

Dust the floor with the string mop. Take pains 
to get the dust out of the corners and from under 
the tub. Dust the chair and the woodwork. 

Wash the closet brush with soap in the wash- 
basin, rinse, shake thoroughly and hang up (this 
brush is usually kept in an inconspicuous corner of 
the bathroom). 

Wash and wipe the basin taps. Wipe off all pipes 
belowr the basin with the duster. If necessary, 
scrub the basin. 

Wash and rinse the scrub cloth and the duster 
in the basin and wring as dry as possible. Rinse 
out the basin and wipe with the duster. Hang up 
the cloths to dry. If tubs and other appliances 
have been neglected and are very dirty, it may be 
necessary to scrub them with kerosene. 

CLEANING THE FIRE-PLACE 

Cleaning Fire-PIace (Cornell Reading Course) 

— Apparatus: a stove apron, newspaper, dustpan, 
whisk, the blackleading implements and a duster. 

Spread the newspaper to protect the hearth. 

Brush the ashes from the fire basket or andirons, 
and move the basket or irons out on the news- 
paper. 

Brush the ashes down the ash-hole; or take 
them out, if no ash-hole. 

Blacken the fire basket or andirons, and replace 
them. 

Lay a fresh fire ready to light, using the news- 
paper from the hearth. 

Brush up the hearth, dust the mantel and fire- 
irons. 

Put away the blackleading implements, dustpan 
and other apparatus, and get a basin of warm 
water, a small scrub brush and some soap. 

Wash the hearthstone, and if necessary the fire- 
irons. 

A fireplace with red bricks may have the bricks 
reddened with the following reddening mixture: 

1 02. common glue, I tablesp. alum, Yi lb. 
Venetian red, I lb. Spanish brown, 1 gallon water. 

Dissolve the glue in the water over the fire. 
While hot, add the alum. Add the Venetian red 
and Spanish brown. If too light, add more red 
and brown; if too dark, add water, a little at a 
time, until right. Mix well. Keep in a closely 
corked bottle. Apply with a paint brush.

HOUSEHOLD MISCELLANY 



HOME-MADE CEDAR CHEST 

Get a large pine packing box, hinge on the lid 
and putty up the cracks, if any, unless you can 
get a box without cracks made of tongue and 
groove lumber. 

Buy a large bottle of cedar oil from a druggist 
and paint the interior of the box thoroughly with 
the oil. Use it generously, let the oil soak well 
into the wood and all crevices. When perfectly 
dry, line the box with cambric and cover the out- 
side with any preferred material, using ornamental 
brass-head tacks. 

The cedar oil will retain the strong odor for a 
long time and it is as moth-proof as the cedar 
wood itself. But if you want the job even more 
permanent you can obtain "cedar-paper" (paper 
treated with cedar oil and also waxed) with which 
you can line the box before putting in the cambric 
lining. 

Cleaning Lamps — (Cornell Reading Course) — 
Apparatus: an old newspaper, the kerosene can, a 
damp flannelette duster, lamp scissors and a dry 
towel. 

Carry the lamps to a sink, or to a table conveni- 
ent to the sink. Spread the paper and place every- 
thing on it. 

Wash and dry the lamp chimneys as if they 
were tumblers, set them aside and put away the 
towel. 

Open up the lamp burner, screw up the wick, 
trim off the char with the scissors, and screw down 
the wick a quarter of an inch below the brass. Be 
careful not to drop the char around. Round wicks 
must have the char rubbed off with the duster. 

Soap one corner of the duster and rub carefully 
every part of the brass burner; if necessary, polish 
as directed for polishing brass. 

Fill each lamp nearly full of kerosene. See that 
the burner is properly screwed on, and wipe the 
body of the lamp carefully. 

Put on the chimneys and set the lamps in their 
places. 

Wash the scissors and duster and hang the duster 
to dry. Gather all trimmings and burn both trim- 
mings and paper. They are not safe to leave 
around. 

Odorless Lamps and Oil Stoves — The most fre- 
quent cause of the disagreeable odor from lamps, 
oil heaters, stoves and so on, is the evaporation of 
a bit of oil left on the outside. 

If lamps or heaters remain a day or two un- 
lighted the oil will often soak through the pores, 
or will "climb" the wick and spread outside: they 
should always be carefully wiped off before using, 
as well as just after filling. 



Lamp Cleaning — Take lamp wicks when new 
and soak them in good apple vinegar. Do not 
wring them out but hang near a stove or lay on a 
plate until dry. This treatment will double the 
lighting power of your lamps or lanterns; also with 
wicks prepared this way only one cleaning each 
week is necessary, for the wick will not smoke and 
the chimney and globe will not blacken around 
the top. 

To Save Gas Globes — To avoid the flare, when 
lighting gas, from cracking globe, simply keep a 
small hairpin slipped over the edge of the globe. 
It is not clear just why, but the little wire hairpin 
does the w^ork. 

Picture Stick Have a smooth, strong stick about 

40 inches long, with a deep notch in one end. 
With this, pictures may be lifted from the wall and 
brushed and replaced without your climbing up 
and down. 

To Remove Staple — Run a nail through it and 
catch a claw hammer under nail. 

Disinfect the Telephone The telephone should 

be Vi^ashed and wiped out every few days, both ear 
and mouthpiece. 

To Renovate Sweeper — The sweeper brush 
bristles become soft from long use and do not 
sweep up pieces as well as when new and stiff. Put 
a little common baking soda in some hot water, 
take the brush out of the sweeper and dip it up 
and down in this. Let it dry in the sun and it will 
be like new. Hair bristles of any brush can be 
treated in the same way with the best of results. 

At least once a week the sweeper should be thor- 
oughly cleaned and the brush freed from hair and 
threads. The bearing should be frequently oiled — 
the smallest amount being used; a feather will be 
easy for applying the oil. 

Creaking Hinges — should be rubbed with a piece 
of soap; oil spoils looks of the paint. 

Care of Woodwork — Tea water is found an ex- 
cellent cleanser for varnished woodwork. To ob- 
tain this pour water on used tea leaves and strain 
through a cloth or muslin. The tea water removes 
the dirt quite easily. 

White paint should be cleansed with warm water, 
using a trifle whiting on the cloth, then rinsing 
^vith clear water. 

Clean flannel dipped in paraffin oil will satis- 
factorily remove finger marks on polished or 
painted wood if rubbed on for a few minutes. Wipe 
with a clean cloth wrung from hot water to re- 
move the odor.

To Clean Windows — (Cornell Reading Course) 
— Apparatus: a high stepladder, fiber tub, damp 
flannelette duster, scrub cloth, soft linen towel, 
chamois leather, ammonia, and warm water. 

Fill the tub half full of warm water and add a 
tablespoonful of ammonia or a few drops of kero- 
sene. 

Carry the ladder to the window, roll up the 
shade and take it down. Unroll it on the floor or 
over a table, then roll it up, dusting both sides as 
it rolls. (See Cleaning Shades, previous Section.) 
Stand it aside, marking to which window it belongs 
if more than one is being cleaned. 

Dust the window, especially the surrounding 
woodwork, with the damp flannelette duster. 

Wash the glass, especially corners, and dry with 
the linen towel. Polish with the chamois leather. 

Replace the shade, testing carefully, and make 
sure the spring works properly. 

Wash out the tub, towel, cloth and duster. Hang 
the cloths to dry and put everything else away. 

If chamois leather is not available use crumpled 
newspaper or tissue; toilet paper is good. 

The following mixture may be used instead of 
ammonia and water, but the resulting white dust 
must be carefully wiped up: 1 tablespoonful pre- 
cipitated whiting; 2 tablespoonfuls household am- 
monia. 

Care of Windows — Instead of cleaning the win- 
dows with soap and water try rubbing them with a 
cloth dipped in a mixture of ammonia and whiting 
and then polish with a clean chamois. This makes 
them much brighter than soap and water. 

To keep windows clean rub with a cloth slightly 
moistened with paraffin or kerosene, afterwards 
polishing with a dry soft duster or chamois leather; 
this prevents flies settling and making marks on 
the glass. 

A cheese cloth dampened with kerosene will 
clean windows quickly when water cannot be ap- 
plied to the glass without freezing. 

To Remove Rust — from curtain rings or other 
small articles, put them in cloudy ammonia for 
half hour and stir them around. If rusted points 
of pins will not push easily through curtains or 
other fabrics, stick them in a bar of soap and they 
will slip easily. 

To Mend a Wire Screen — Take a piece of screen- 
ing large enough for a patch; ravel the edge of 
this patch by taking off several wires on each side 
leaving a fringe of wire points an inch or more 
long. Bend this fringe down at right angles, put 
the patch in position and push the bent fringe 
through. Bend the fringe in and put it against a 
flat board and hammer it gently. The patch will 
hold and insects cannot get through at the edges. 

Cleaning Globes — Globes that have become dis- 
colored from smoke or otherwise may be cleaned 



in the following manner: Soak the globes for about 
an hour in warm water with soda or borax in it; 
then add fresh warm water with a few drops of 
ammonia and wash well with a soaked linen rag. 
This is better than flannel as there are generally 
loose hairs left by flannel unless it is very fine. 
Polish with soft linen rag. 

To Waterproof Matches — Dip them in melted 
paraffin. They strike as well as ever and are not 
ruined by dampness. 

Wobbly Candles in Holder — If ends of candles 
are placed for a moment in hot water, then pressed 
into sockets, they will mold to size and shape and 
thereafter sit snug in the holders. 

Candles Will Last Longer if given a coat of 

colorless varnish; the wax will not run down 
through — which is an item of appearance as well 
as economy. 

Bayberry Candles — To make bayberry candles 
melt the berries for a day, let stand 24 hours, 
strain, then melt a little and pour into candle 
molds, running a wick through each candle. If 
they do not harden perfectly, melt and strain again. 
It requires a great many berries to make a few 
candles. The wicking can be had at any hard- 
ware store; it comes in a ball-like twine. 

Scald New Brooms in hot suds before using; 
this will toughen the fibre. Always stand newr 
brooms with the brush end up and the weight of? 
the fibre. 

Cotton Gloves for Cleaning — Cotton gloves to 
wear during housework are cooler and better in 
every way than old kid gloves, although the latter 
are serviceable with the fingers cut off. If bought 
especially for this purpose get a size larger than 
usually worn. 

Pockets in Aprons — Have two enormous pockets 
in work apron. They will save many steps. In 
one room will be many things to be carried into 
another, which put in one pocket. Use the other 
for trash or things to be thrown away. The hands 
are free for the cleaning up that is being done.

TEXTILES— THEIR CARE AND USE 

(Extracts from Bulletin Under Above Heading, Iowa State College of Agriculture) 



TESTING MATERIALS 

If one is to buy intelligently, there must be some knowledge of method of 
judging materials. Chemical and microscopic tests determine accurately the con- 
tent and value of materials, but they are not feasible for the average housewife. 
There are many simple tests, however, which can be depended upon to give fairly 
accurate information of standard materials, and with some of these every buyer 
should be somewhat familiar if she is to buy wisely. She should make herself famil- 
iar w^ith the look and feel and weight of standard materials, and although there will 
be variations, if she has learned to judge the quality of some reliable materials, she 
will be able to grade others from those w^hich she knows. 

All textile fabrics are made with two sets of threads. The lengthwise threads 
are known as the warp and crosswise threads as the woof. 

A good way to test the endurance of any material is to take the cloth firmly 
and stretch quickly first warp way and then filling way. If the material tears or frays 
in either direction it shows a lack of strength. 

The strength may also be tested by pushing the w^arp and woof threads back 
and forth to see if they move easily. If they can be pushed without difficulty and 
are soft and brittle the material will not be strong, cuid when strain is applied (as 
in seams) it will fray. 



I. COTTON 

The characteristics of cotton are: 

1. Strong and elastic. 

2. Launders easily. 

3. Not easily affected by heat or alkali. (Strong 

washing powders injure the fiber.) 

4. Dyes easily. 

5. Inexpensive. 

6. Easily affected by acid. 

7. A good conductor of heat. 

6. Does not absorb moisture readily and gives it 

up slowly. 
9. Burns easily with light yellow flashes and 

leaves a fine ashy powder. 

Shrinking Cottons and Setting Their Color 

To shrink wash materials, put them direct into a 
tub of hot water. Squeeze the water out gently in- 
stead of wringing it out. Hang the material by the 



selvedge to dry. Place the clothes pins close to- 
gether so the cloth will not stretch. Turn the cloth 
occasionally from one selvedge to the other so it 
will dry evenly. Before it is quite dry, iron it on 
the wrong side. If you let it get too dry to iron 
nicely, press it under a damp cloth. Do not 
sprinkle it, for that gives it a rough, dry look. 

A quick method to shrink very thin fabrics is to 
roll the wet material between several thicknesses of 
Turkish toweling, wring as dry as possible, and 
press immediately. 

Delicately colored fabrics often fade when 
washed. It is always advisable to test the color 
with a small piece oi fabric before washing. Vari- 
ous formulas are used to set colors and some of the 
common household tests are as follows: 

Salt (1 cupful in 1 gallon of water). 

Vinegar (^ cupful in I gallon water). 

Sugar of lead ( I teaspoonful in I gallon of 
water). (Poison.) 



31 



32 



THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Section II.— GENERAL UTILITY 



Alum ( 1 tablespoonful in I gallon water). 

As dye materials are made of a great variety of 
chemicals, it is always advisable to test them by 
soaking small pieces of cloth in the above solu- 
tions. 

To insure a perfect color test, the pieces of 
cloth should be left in the various solutions several 
hours or even over night, then dried and the color 
compared with the original color of the fabric. 

Sizing of Cotton 

Cotton being the cheapest of materials, cotton 
cloth is not adulterated with any of the other com- 
mon fibers, but it can be made to appear heavier 
by the addition of mixtures called sizing. Starches, 
gums, dextrine, glue and china-clay, as w^ell as 
other ingredients in varying proportions, constitute 
this sizing, which may add a large per cent, to the 
weight of the cloth. The spaces between the 
threads are filled up and a good finish is given to 
the cloth, although the wearing quality is not in- 
creased. If present in large quantities the cloth is 
greatly reduced in weight and firmness after the 
first washing. Adulterations of this kind can be 
detected by the feeling, a large quantity imparting 
a harshness to the material. In very thin fabrics 
the sizing may often be detected by holding the 
cloth to the light, w^hen its starch shows between 
the threads. 

Mercerized Cotton 

Cotton is mercerized by treating ordinary cotton 
with strong sodium hydroxide solution w^ith a simul- 
taneous stretching of the fibers. It is then w^ashed 
in water and dilute acid. 

After mercerization the yarn is stronger and 
heavier and it takes dye very readily, but a fiber 
mercerized for the second time shows no further 
affinity for dye stuffs. 

It costs more than twice as much to produce 
mercerized yarn as ordinary yarn. Mercerized cot- 
ton is characterized by a high luster almost like 
silk. 

Cotton may be made to look like mercerized cot- 
ton by passing the cloth under pressure under en- 
graved rollers. This is a means of adulteration. 

Cotton is probably used more than any other 
material for underclothing. It is a good conductor 
of heat and is desirable for summer wear. But 
w^hen it is loosely woven or a pile left on the sur- 
face as in canton flannel or outing flannel, it is a 
poor conductor of heat and is desirable for the win- 
ter months. The still air in the meshes is a poor 
conductor of heat and the material feels warnier 
because a loosely woven garment holds more air. 

n. UNEN 
The characteristics of linen are: 

1. Snowy white w^hen bleached, 

2. Strong and durable. 

3. Smooth and glossy when laundered. 

4. Good conductor of heat. 



5. Wrinkles easily. 

6. Water is readily absorbed and evaporated. 

7. It does not retain stains as persistently as cot- 

ton. 

8. It does not leave lint. 

9. Not easily affected by acids. 
I 0. Washes easily. 

Aids in Recognition of Linen 

1. Wash linen and soak in glycerine. Trans- 
parent if linen, opaque if cotton. 

2. Soak so-called linen material in sulphuric 
acid. The cotton may be washed out, leaving the 
linen fibers. 

3. Wash thoroughly sample of so-called linen 
material in hot soap suds and rinse in hot soft 
w^ater to remove the finishing material. Dry thor- 
oughly and place in hot muriatic acid one minute. 
Transfer quickly to fresh w^ater. If fabric is all cot- 
ton, the sample will drop into minute pieces, w^hile 
if it is linen the shape w^ill remain unchanged. 

4. Tear linen quickly. The threads should be 
smooth along torn edges. Cotton threads curl, 

5. Linen does not burn quite as readily as cot- 
ton. It leaves a small amount of ash. 

6. Wash cloth to remove dressing, dry in fresh 
air. Immerse for two or three minutes in a concen- 
trated solution of sulphuric acid. Cotton under 
this treatment w^ill dissolve almost completely; 
linen remains nearly unaffected. 

7. Equally thick linen and cotton goods exhibit 
considerable difference in w^eight. Linen goods of 
equal volume are about 1 7 per cent, heavier. 

8. Cotton materials feel warmer than linen. 
Cotton by its peculiar structure makes the circu- 
lation of air difficult and holds the heat more than 
linen goods of the same thickness, (From 15 to 
30 per cent, more.) 

Absorption Test 

9. Wash a small piece of fringed material from 
dressing. Place it in a 10 per cent, solution of 
copper sulphate and allow it to remain ten minutes. 
Wash thoroughly to remove the adhering surplus 
of copper salt. When thoroughly washed, place 
the material in a 10 per cent, solution of potas- 
sium ferro cyanide. "If the material is half linen 
there appears in the part w^hich consists of flax 
fiber (warp or woof) a striking copper-red color, 
due to the separation of ferro cyanide of copper; 
while the cotton fibers remain uncolored." 

Oil Test 

10. Linen, if freed from dressing, becomes 
translucent when treated with olive oil; cotton re- 
mains opaque, 

"The linen fiber, because of its thick cell wall, 
assumes a transparent appearance. It appears 
clear against the light, and dark when light falls 
upon it. The opposite effect is noticed in cotton."

HI. WOOL 

The characteristics of wool are: 

1. Not a good conductor of heat. 

2. Readily affected by heat and sudden changes 
in temperature. 

3. Difficult to launder. 

4. Readily affected by friction. 

5. Very elastic. 

6. Absorbs a large amount of moisture; 12 to 
I 7 per cent, of its own weight under ordinary con- 
dition and 30 to 50 per cent, in very damp weather. 

Wool is very curly, and possesses a scaly struc- 
ture in a much more marked degree than hair, in 
which the external scales lie flat. The scales on 
wool fiber stand up w^hen moist and w^arm like the 
scales on a pine cone, and w^hen cold and dry or 
cold and moist, lie flat like the scales on a fish. 

The scales are of a gelatinous material and be- 
come soft under heat and moisture, and if pressure 
is applied the scales lock permanently together and 
the cloth is reduced in length and width and is 
shrunken. 

A seventy-two-inch material may be shrunken or 
felted to fifty-four inches, and there may be in a 
closely felted wool fiber three thousand scales to 
the inch. 

Sponging and Shrinking 

All w^oolen materials should be sponged either 
at the shop or at home before they are made up. 
Sponging not only prevents the garment from spot- 
ting, but keeps it from shrinking unevenly in wet 
weather. 

For sponging, the selvedges should be cut off or 
the edges clipped to prevent their drawing when 
the material shrinks. The ironing board should 
be covered smoothly with two or three thicknesses 
of blanket and two of cotton sheeting. Lay the 
material face downward, or if it is a double width 
fabric, it may be folded in the center, right side in. 

Take a piece of sheeting a little longer than the 
width of the material and three-quarters of a yard 
wide, w^et it, w^ring it dry and lay it smoothly over 
the suiting. Press several times with a hot iron, 
remove the damp cloth and substitute a dry one, 
pressing it until the suiting is dry. Never use a 
coarse fabric for pressing, as it will leave the im- 
print of the weave upon the material. Keep the 
iron moving or it w^ill leave its mark. Do not 
press hard. This will push the material in folds in 
front of the iron and will stretch the cloth. 

Adulteration of Wool 

The demand for woolen cloth far exceeds the 
supply of new w^ool and it is necessary to resort 
to various measures to increase the supply of cloth. 

In adulterating a material the manufacturer 
seeks a material cheaper than the fiber he wishes 
to adulterate, one which can be concealed readily. 



Wool when combined with cheaper cotton fibre 
makes a material which wears well, but does not 
keep its shape as well as all-wool cloth. Because 
of the felting property of wool it is quite possible 
to conceal a good deal of cotton. 



Shoddy 

Wool is used over and over again. The best all- 
wool rags are selected to produce fibers, which are 
respun and again woven either separately if of 
very good quality, or mixed with new wool or 
cotton. Such a material is warm, looks w^ell for a 
time and has a place, but must not be bought for 
new^ wool or demand the price of good woolen 
cloth. 

One class of shoddy consists of very short fibers, 
clippings from the mills, which are w^orked into 
the surface of a felted cloth after it is w^oven. These 
clippings after a time work out and are found in 
the bottom of coats, inside linings, etc., leaving the 
surface of the cloth threadbare. 



Woolen and Worsteds 

"Various distinctions are given between these 
two yarns; viz., that woolen is made from short 
wool and worsted from long wool, and that woolen 
is carded and worsted combed. While both of 
these statements are to a certain extent true, the 
real distinction lies in the fact that woolen thread 
has its fibers running in many directions, more or 
less tangled, while worsted thread has its fibers 
quite parallel. Since woolen cloths are quite largely 
felted, this crisscrossing in every direction leaves 
many loose ends of fibers exposed on its surface to 
mat together and form a compact material. 
Worsted, on the other hand, usually shows the 
threads of the weave, and therefore needs to have 
the ends of the threads held in place, so as not to 
produce a felted or rough surface. The short 
fibers seem best suited for w^oolen and the long 
fibers for w^orsted. The processes used to bring 
about these two results are quite different.*'

Tests for Wool 

1. Pure wool will dissolve in a solution of lye. 

2. Detect wool from shoddy by means of micro- 
scope, 

3. Determination of cotton in wool; boil sam- 
ple in a five per cent, solution of caustic potash 
fifteen minutes. Wool is destroyed. 

4. Funchin dye turns wool a deep pink, leav- 
ing the cotton white. (This is most effective when 
used on flannel having a cotton warp with a wool 
filling.) 

IV. SILK 

The characteristics of silk are: 

1. Poor conductor of heat. 

2. Absorbs moisture readily. 

3. Friction w^eakens the materials. 

4. Careless washing destroys the gloss. 

5. It scorches easily. 

6. Strong and tenacious. (Tensile strength 
"64,000 lbs. per square inch.") 

7. Pure silk wears w^ell. 

8. Silk is soft and light in weight. 

9. A good generator, but a poor conductor of 
electricity. 

I 0. Easily dyed. 

I 1. Fibers injured by high degree of heat or 
sudden changes of temperature. 

12. Absorbs moisture readily. 

"Silk, frequently known as the fiber of lux- 
ury." It bleaches and dyes beautifully and com- 
bines well with other fibers, both animal and vege- 
table. The cost of raw silk is about thirty times 
that of raw cotton and the waste in weaving at 
least five times that of cotton. 

Silk has a very great ability to absorb metallic 
salts, and there is practically no silk on the market 
to-day that is entirely free from metallic salts, but 
there is a great difference in the amount present. 

Pongee is a material made from the cocoon of 
the uncultivated silk worm; rajah, tussah, and 
other uneven, coarse materials are from the same 
source. These silks are very strong, but do not 
have a high luster. 



Tests for Silk 

1. Indications of adulteration: 

Pin holes in new silk; weighted with metallic 
salts. (One pound of raw silk w^ill make 
two or three pounds of weighted silk.) 

2. Test for weighing: 

Will burn easily if not weighted, will retain 
its shape if w^eighted. 

3. Test for silk and cotton: 

Strong alkali will dissolve silk and w^ill leave 
the cotton. 



Summary of Adulteration Methods 

1. By combination. Use of other fibers than 
the one indicated by the name of the material. 
Example, cotton in woolens, cotton in linens, etc. 

2. By substitutions. Selling one fiber under 
the name of an entirely different one. Example, 
mercerized cotton sold for silk, or linen. 

3. By increasing the weight of a material. 
(a) Cottons and linens with starch; (b) Silks w^ith 
metallic salts and dyes. 

4. By giving a finish which is deceptive. (a) 
Heavy pressing or calendaring an ordinary cotton 
to imitate mercerizing. (b) Finishing cotton to 
look like linen. (c) Printing paste dots on cotton 
to produce the effect of embroidered dotted swiss. 

5. By use of made-over yarns. Example: 
Shoddy in w^oolens, also addition of short w^ool, 
felted in surface. 

When w^omen demand a better quality of mate- 
rials and refuse to buy the cheap things, the manu- 
facturers will cease to produce worthless things. 
Perhaps, however, before that day arrives the 
thoughtful w^orkers of the land will have succeeded 
in passing a pure textile law, which will do for 
our cloth what the pure food act is doing for our 
food supplies. 

At the present time the rush to the bargain 
counter, the enormous amount of cheap, poor ma- 
terial manufactured, the catering to fads, novelties 
and the great waste in dress all go to prove that 
there are many w^omen who are not intelligent 
buyers. 



THE CARE OF WOOLENS 

It is a matter of economy that every householder should know how to have 
woolens light, soft and clean — both clothing and household furnishings. They will 
keep twice as long and not shrink and harden but remain as soft as when new. 

We shall not touch here on the laundering of woolens, however, but refer 
you to Section IX, "The Laundry," w^here the washing and caring for woolens, 
blankets, sweaters, etc., is thoroughly covered. Read carefully the article under that 
section.

CARE OF OTHER APPAREL 



MISCELLANEOUS 
Restoring Velvet — When you get caught in a 
rain shower or snowstorm with your new velvet 
hat on, it certainly is not pleasing to your disposi- 
tion. However, if measures are taken at once no 
harm is done to the hat. Take several old hand- 
kerchiefs or a piece of soft cloth and pat the 
water out of the hat. When most of it on the out- 
side has been gotten off in this manner rub with 
a dry cloth until the velvet is quite dry. Put hat 
>vhere it will be thoroughly dry over night, and 
next morning brush it hard with a clothes brush. 
Finally use a hat or velvet brush and you will find 
that your hat looks as well as it did before it got 
wet. 

Spotted Velvet To restore the color of velvet 

that has become spotted by rain, steam the whole 
surface to make the shade even. Do not brush 
before steaming. The velvet will look darker at 
first but it will soon become lighter in the open 
air. 

To Clean Furs — Furs may be cleaned by the fol- 
lowing process; warm some bran in a saucepan, 
keeping it well stirred so that it does not burn. 
Rub this well into the fur several times until there 
is no dirt on the bran; then shake the fur thor- 
oughly. 

Brushing Velvets — Besides the ordinary clothes 
brush it is well to always keep a piece of velvet 
or velveteen to be used for dusting ribbons, velvets, 
hat trimmings and other articles of silk. It will 
be found far better for the purpose than any brush. 
For dusting velvet or velveteen an excellent brush, 
better than one of bristles, is made by rolling up a 
piece of crepe, which need not be nev^^, into a con- 
venient little bundle. 

A Petticoat Hint — Put on a china silk dust rufHe 
in place of the cotton one usually found on the 
average priced silk petticoat. It reduces friction, 
makes the skirt wear longer, sheds the dust instead 
of holding it as the cotton ruffle does, washes 
nicely, and if good quality will outlast two petti- 
coats. 

To Curl Feathers — Take a round stick of any 
kind; hold feather close to it and carefully fold 
the down around the wood, not close. Slip over 
it a small bag made to fit loosely over the stick and 
feathers. Hold in steam from a kettle till well 
dampened; then put in a warm spot till perfectly 
dry: the feather will be nicely curled without dam- 
age to its texture. 

To Keep Rubber Articles — Bathing caps and 
other rubber goods can be kept fresh and new by 
giving them a "bath" of talcum powder, when dry, 
after use. 



CARE OF SHOES 
When putting away shoes over season, unless 
properly taken care of, you will be sadly disap- 
pointed. All shoes are more or less damp -with 
perspiration, and as they dry out the toes turn up 
and deep \vrinkles settle across the leather. Here 
is the remedy: Brush >vell, removing every particle 
of dust, rub with vaseline, pack full of crushed 
paper, wrap with paper and pack away. 

Waterproofing Shoes — The following are two 
home methods of waterproofing shoes and leather. 
Mix eight parts linseed oil, ten parts boiled oil, 
eight parts suet and eight of beeswax by heating 
them over a slow fire. Warm the leather to be 
treated, and with a brush apply the warm mixture 
to it, making sure to coat the seams carefully. Or; 
melt together over a slow fire one part white pine 
tar, one part Neat's foot oil, and one of beef tallow. 
Apply this mixture as above. 

To Polish Damp Shoes Mix a few drops of 

parafiin with the blacking and the shoes will take 
the polish at once. 

To Polish Wet Bqots — Dry the boots or shoes 
thoroughly, but slowly. Don't put them in an 
oven, unless watched closely; they will burn or 
warp easily. Rub the surface of the leather with 
a raw potato: set aside until once more dry. Then 
polish in usual manner. 

To Clean Tan Shoes — Put them on shoe-trees 
and scrub them with a stif? brush with soap and 
water. This removes every bit of the polish, the 
spots with it, and when you polish them again you 
can hardly recognize them as not new. 

Too Much Tan — A coating of thick castor oil 
applied with a soft flannel cloth to exaggerated 
colored tan shoes will tone down their vividness 
considerably. 

To Bronze Rubbers — Black rubbers can be 
bronzed by simply painting with the same polish 
used for the brown shoes you want them to match. 

A New Shoe which hurts the feet. Put on a 
stocking and dip foot in water. Slip on the shoe 
and walk in it a few moments. You will have no 
more trouble. 

To Stop Squeaking of Shoes Raise the inner 

lining of the sole and cover the sole liberally with 
toilet povkfder, then replace the lining. Repeat if 
required. 

Squeaky Shoes — Try dipping the soles in kero- 
sene. 

White Belt — A good method to clean this is to 
rub powdered borax in gently with a piece of white 
flannel.

THE SEWING ROOM 



TO SHRINK UNENS 

To shrink linens, and similar wash-goods ; lay the material in folds of a yard, 
then baste all the selvedges together on one side, leaving other selvedges free. Then 
baste at each end through all the folds. Fold the goods now so it will lie smoothly 
in the vessel to be used, without crushing. Fill the vessel with cold water sufficiently 
to cover the goods and leave the material immersed for about half an hour; wring- 
ing out lightly without creasing. 

Hang the basted end to a line, and pull and straighten with the hands until 
smooth and uniform; fold one corner crosswise to another to see if the sides regis- 
ter straight, slip the hands up and outward between the free selvedges until all the 
folds are smooth. 

When almost dry remove the bastings on the ends and assist the drying by 
shaking and shaping. Crease the folds to show the yards lengths. When entirely 
dry, the material should look like new ; in all likelihood no ironing will be neces- 
sary. 

SEWING-ROOM HINTS 



The Sewing Machine does not always need more 
oil when it will not work easily, it may be gummed 
with old oil, or may be only "cold.'* Place it near 
a fire or in a very warm room; this will melt the 
oil and enable you to see if gummed with old oil; 
if so, wipe off the gummed parts before oiling 
anew. 

To Tighten a Belt — Instead of stopping work to 
take off belt and shorten it, slip a fe^v small rubber 
bands over the small wheel; they will give the loose 
belt "purchase" until you have time for the per- 
manent correction. 

When belt first begins to loosen too much, oil the 
band with a little castor oil and turn the handle of 
the machine rapidly; this will shrink the leather 
and shorten the belt, and at the same time improve 
the leather itself. 

Slipping Garments — To prevent garments slip- 
ping off the leaf of the machine ^vhile stitching 
heavy goods, slip an old pillow case over the leaf 
and pin it tight. If sewing dark material use a 
dark cloth if the lint off the slip adheres to the 
goods. 

A fine steel crochet hook is most useful about a 
machine for removing dust, lint, threads and 
gummed oil in corners. 

To remove machine oil from a white garment, 
rub with chalk as soon as possible, leave for a 
short time, then brush and the spot will disappear. 

Home-made Bust Form — Take a well-fitted lining 
and stitch and press it and sew hooks and eyes 



down front. Bind neck with tape to prevent stretch- 
ing. Take an ordinary feather bed pillow, stand 
on end and fit the lining around it, work the pil- 
low into the lining until every corner is filled out. 
It will make a duplicate of your own form sufficient 
for all practical purposes for draping and fitting, 
pinning and sewing, and will save you many an 
hour of standing fatigued while some one assists 
you in the arduous fitting process. 

When sewing braid on the bottom of a skirt, 
insert a small piece of cardboard between the hem, 
moving it along as you proceed, and you will save 
much time and temper. 

Pearl Buttons may be fastened on a dress by 
pinning them on from the inside with very small 
safety pins; they can thus be removed for washing. 

Buttonhole Hint — In making buttonholes in very 
soft material, rub a little flour and water paste on 
the underside. It will stiffen and give a firm sur- 
face, also prevent cutting the hole too large, and 
will not discolor the fabric. 

Ball and Socket Snaps — Sew the ball snap on the 
upper piece. The back of this is flat and will leave 
no mark on outside; the socket snap would leave 
a round mark in the centre, particularly noticeable 
on smooth-finished goods. 

Knotting a Thread — Do you appreciate the sim- 
ple fact that if you tie the knot, after threading a 
needle, always in the end of the thread just snipped 
from the spool, you will avoid that troublesome 
kinking you have often encountered?

In mending a rent, in a delicate muslin or other 
material, place the torn part, with new piece be- 
neath, in an embroidery hoop and the darning is 
much easier. 



Novel Mending — Wool or silk: carefully smooth 
the frayed part, then moisten a piece of the mate- 
rial with very thin mucilage and put a heavy weight 
upon it until it dries; the mended place can be less 
easily detected than if darned or mended.

THE TABLE BEAUTIFUL 



The woman of fine sensibilities does not need her love of beautiful table 
appointments stimulated. It is instinctive to desire and appreciate the "home- 
making" value of the crisp, fresh beauty of spotless napery and the gleam of pol- 
ished glass and silver. She joys as much in the observance of the principles of 
decorative appearance in the furnishing, arrangement and appointment of her table 
as she does in that of the rest of the house. 

But v^e have bought our table covers without regard for table china, and our 
table china without regard to our other implements and materials, and we use the 
same old things day after day with little thought of studied variety and harmonious 
combinations. We are usually handicapped at the outset with an ill-assorted jumble 
of w^edding presents of no relation one to another. And we start off wrong, as a 
rule, from a natural pride in these gifts, by displaying the finest of them, and as 
many of them, as often as we can, without thou;;;ht of inharmonies. 

It would be a hopeless task to attempt here to tell one what is right and 
what is wrong. If one has no ear for music it is a long, tedious process to learn, 
and only the one who wants to learn can by close application master real harmony 
and know real beauty and perfection and produce it. 

But the harmony of appearance is as essential as any other item of "home- 
making." Study your table. Learn what brings about the beauty of softness, 
simplicity and consistency. Do the best you can with your "wedding presents" 
by adding to them intelligently from time to time, as you find you inevitably have 
to add various new appointments. Withhold what you have, however beautiful 
in itself, until you can use it in fit surroundings in combinations that make a 
whole note. 

And remember above all, that much "fancy stuff" is now altogether passe, 
and overloading is eggregious sinfulness. By staying close to simplicity many 
combinations become appropriate and harmonious; the elaborate or unusual will 
clash in almost any setting you can plan.

40 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK.— Section 111.— DINING ROOM 

A few flowers, or a little living green thing, is almost w^ithout exception 
tasteful and quite as important as the forks and spoons. It may be a Japanese 
dwarf-tree or a single flower or sprig of evergreen, but if properly set it lifts the 
thought subtly from meat and drink and cheers the whole tone of things as uncon- 
sciously and successfully as the bit of cheerful conversation which is itself as essen- 
tial a part of a meal as the buttered bread. 

Thank the gods of good taste that the time has passed when we sat down to 
the table loaded with one glory of silverware and one glory of glassware and one 
glory of chinaware and one glory of linenware, and each glory out-glorifying every 
other in its glory. We spread now a feast of simple wholesomeness for the eye as 
well as for the palate, and each helps with the perfect assimilation of the other. 

TABLE LINEN 

(Iowa State College) 

Linen is sometimes called the textile of luxury, but there is no textile so 
quickly cleaned, so fine, or so durable for constant service. Linen is expensive 
because of the slow process of manufacturing. 

Within a few years the weaving of linen has increased in the United States. 

Irish linen is noted for its endurance, reliable quality and snowy whiteness. 
It still holds a high reputation, and its manufacture dates back to the thirteenth cen- 
tury, and Belfast is the center of the industry. Much of the linen in Ireland is grass 
bleached. The designs are simple; many of the old patterns are still used. 

Scotch linen is silver white in color and is grass bleached. It is moderate in 
price; the designs are generally more elaborate than the Irish. 

French damask is noted for its exquisite and effective designs. The threads 
are fine and round and especial attention is given to the beauty of the finish. 

German linen is silver white and of high grade. The finest grades are not 
exported as much as the medium grades. 

During the period of the shortage of linen and consequently high prices of 
table linen, it is wise to save as much as possible by the use of other materials. 
Many housekeepers find it an economy as well as a convenience, which saves labor 
in washing, to use the squares and runners of Japanese towling, which are to be had 
at reasonable prices and in attractive designs. 



THE DINING ROOM— THE TABLE BEAUTIFUL 



41 



TABLE SETTING 

(Iowa State College of Agriculture) 
Diagram Showing Arrangement of Single Cover 




Whether a meal is simple or elaborate much of its success depends on the 
care with which the dishes are placed on the table. 

Silence Cloth — Cover the table with a silence cloth, which may consist of 
table padding, a thin white blanket or heavy cotton flannel. 

Table Cloth — The cloth should be large enough to fall from ten to twelve 
inches below the edge of the table. It should be placed with the center of the cloth 
exactly in the center of the table. 

Silver — The knife and fork for the main course mark the cover. They are 
placed one inch from edge of table, knife at the right with sharp edge toward the 
plate; fork at left, tines turned up. The other pieces of silver are parallel with 
these, and placed with the piece to be used first farthest from the plate. The knives 
and spoons are at right and the forks at the left. 

Glass — The glass is placed at the tip of the knife. 

The Butter Plate — The butter plate is placed at the tip of the fork, and a little 
to the left. 

The Napkin — The napkin is placed at the left of the forks with the folds at 
the upper and left-hand sides. 

General Rules — Serve hostess first. 

Place and remove from right. 

Pass to left. 

Everything relating to a course should be removed at the end of that course. 

Folded napkin and small tray should be used in serving. 

Fill glass three-quarters full just before meal is announced. 

Butter, relishes, etc., can be on the table when the guests are seated. 

Soiled dishes should be removed first, then food, next clean dishes, etc. 

Place all knives and spoons to the right. 

Place all forks to the left with the exception of the oyster fork, which is 
placed at the extreme right. 

The guests stand behind or beside their chairs, and are seated from the left 
when the hostess gives the signal.

THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK — Section III.— DINING ROOM 



DINING ROOM EQUIPMENT AND ITS CARE 



Attractive Trays Buy a ten-cent picture frame 

of depth and size desired; buy two handles and 
screws, and insert under the glass some pretty 
cretonne or chintz or a bit of lace where the pic- 
ture belongs. You have a very attractive little tray 
for dining service; or it is suitable in smaller sizes 
for pin-tray on a dresser. 

Napkin Rings for GuesU — Take brass curtain 
rings and wind them with satin ribbon, in different 
colors, and put them away for guest use when 
needed. A set of small gold initials containing all 
letters of the alphabet in tiny paper stickers may 
be obtained for a small sum; you can thus decorate 
the guest's napkin with his or her initial, during 
the visit, a cheerful touch that adds much to the 
atmosphere of a sincere and spontaneous welcome. 

Table Mats made from white pyramid rubber 
matting such as is made for automobiles is better 
than asbestos mats to protect from hot dishes and 
are readily cleaned and kept white with chalk. 
Covers of linen may be used with them if desired. 

To Clean Silver (Cornell Reading Course) — 

Apparatus: a bottle of silver polish, a small piece 
of old, soft cloth, a clean flannel or flannelette 
cloth, a plate brush, and a clean chamois skin. 

Shake the polish bottle thoroughly, wet the old 
cloth with the polish, and rub all the silver all over 
with it. Then wash the mouth and cork of the 
bottle and cork the bottle tightly. When cleaning 
a large amount of silver pour the polish in a small 
saucer to use. 

When the whiting is dry on the silver, rub off 
as much as possible with the flannel cloth. 

Brush the whiting out of cracks and crevices 
with the plate brush. 

Polish with the chamois. If necessary after- 
ward?, \vash the chamois. 

Recipe for Silver Polish — (Cornell Reading 
Course) — Take 1 cup methylated spirit (wood 
alcohol), 2 tablespoonfuls household ammonia, '/4 
cup precipitated whiting. Mix the ingredients and 
keep in a closely corked bottle. Shake thoroughly 
before using. 

Note: The silver polish should be of the consist- 
ency of milk when used. 

Cleaning Silver — If silver is never washed with 
soap it will retain its lustre. Hold under hot faucet 
and use unsoaped mop, then polish with chamois 
skin. 

Keeping Silver — Large pieces of silver, such as 
urns, pitchers, baskets, fruit dishes, should be kept 
in canton flannel bags, nap inside, the bag closed 
with draw strings. Packed in dry flour, silver will 
not tarnish. 

Another Polish — Beat the white of an egg to a 
stiff froth, add enough soda to make a stiff paste. 



Wash the silver first, and thoroughly dry it, then 
rub with the paste until all dark places disappear; 
rinse in cold water and dry with chamois. 

When Cleaning Knives mix a little soda with the 
bathbrick for a polish. 

Broken China Cement — Take 4 oz. clear gum- 
arabic, dissolve in 6 oz. of rain or distilled water; 
add 6 oz. best cane sugar and 3 oz. best white 
starch. Let the whole dissolve, put in a jar, stand 
in a pan of water and boil until the starch becomes 
clear; as it cools add a few drops essence of cloves. 
Keep tightly corked. 

For mending delicate china and ornaments there 
is nothing better than rice-flour or ground rice 
mixed %vith cold water thoroughly and simmered 
over a slow fire until thickened. It can be used hot 
or cold, and is a most durable adhesive. 

Metal and Glass Cement — Common alum melted 
in an iron spoon over hot coals makes a very 
strong cement for joining metal and glass. 

Washing Glassware Glassware should be 

washed only in warm water, either clean or with 
pure white soapsuds, using a stiff brush and clean 
cuttings. Never rub soap directly on glass. Rinse 
in clear %vater, and for drying use linen towels 
kept especially for this purpose. Glass dried by 
placing in clean, fine boxwood sawdust takes on a 
greater lustre. 

To preserve lustre and to brighten dingy glass, 
add a little ammonia or bluing to the water in 
which it is vk^ashed, and after drying polish writh 
very soft chamois or silk handkerchief. 

Glass decanters may be cleaned by partly filling 
with warm water and fine-chopped pieces of raw 
potato; shake up and down for a few minutes, then 
rub over inside with sponge tied to end of a stick; 
dry with soft cloth in same manner. If decanters 
are very soiled the potato peelings should remain 
in the bottle over night before washing out. Shot 
is frequently poured into glass bottles to clean in- 
side, but is apt to leave scratches. 

When paint sticks to glass it can be removed 
\vith hot vinegar. 

To polish cut glass wash it well with soapsuds, 
rinse and then after drying it with a cloth, polish 
it with sawdust and a leather, and the glass will 
be brilliant. 

To Whiten Ivory Knife Handles — Cut a lemon in 
half, dip it into common kitchen salt and rub over 
the handles. This will remove the dirty yellow 
look and make the ivory as bright and white as 
new. 

Cheese-Cloth "Towels" for silver and gtass\vare 
will be found more desirable than crash as they 
are free from lint. 



THE REFRIGERATOR 

Care of Refrigerator — Nothing is more important in the household than 
keeping the refrigerator free and sweet and clean from offensive odors. There is 
no point in housekeeping where watchfulness and nicest care are so important. A 
good housekeeper will have her refrigerator cleaned at least once a week, if not 
more. This is best accomplished in the morning before the iceman comes. No 
woman should trust this matter wholly to a servant, however careful the latter may 
be, for the health of her family is directly involved. 

To Clean Refrigerator — (Cornell Reading Course) — Apparatus: two dishpans, the 
trap brush, a small scrub brush, two dishcloths, a clean towel, soap, washing soda, and 
ammonia. 

Empty the water pan below and replace it. 

Fill the sink or a dishpan half full of strong, hot soapsuds. Put warm water into 
a dishpan to the depth of an inch and add a half tablespoonful ammonia. 

Remove the ice to the other dishpan, using the dishcloths to prevent its slipping. 
Gather up any straws or dirt. 

Remove all food. Put the ice-rack and the shelves into the soapsuds. 

Wash the ice-box carefully and quickly with the ammonia water. Be sure to get all 
the corners clean, and scrub the waste pipe with the trap brush. Rinse it down with the 
ammonia water and then with a dipperful of fresh, clean water. Dry with the dishcloth 
wrung out of clean water. 

If the w^aste pipe is movable, take it out of the food closet and put it in the soap- 
suds. Scrub the ice-rack and the shelves with the scrub brush, and the pipe with the trap 
brush. Let off the suds, rinse the pieces in plenty of cold water, and dry with the towel. 

Replace the ice-rack and the ice, and close the ice-box doors. 

Mix a fresh lot of ammonia water, and wash the walls and the floor of the food 
closet. Be sure the corners are clean. Dry with the towel. Be very sure that movable 
parts belonging to the waste pipe are taken apart, washed thoroughly, and carefully fitted 
back into place. Then replace the waste pipe and the shelves. 

Replace the food but do not close the doors. 

Wash out the pipe cap under the refrigerator most carefully with the ammonia 
water and soap. 

Empty the water pan and wash it thoroughly, with plenty of soap in the ammonia 
water, before replacing it. 

Close the refrigerator doors. Wash out and put away the dishpan, brushes and 
cloths. 

Dangerous if Unsanitary — If the shelves and bottom of the refrigerator are wiped 
every day with a cloth wet in soda and water this will tend to keep it purified. The waste 
pipe must be kept open and clean. It should never connect with a general drain pipe; such 
an arrangement often results in the actual poisoning of foods in the box, in spite of water 
traps and other precautions. A saucer of powdered charcoal placed on the shelf or a piece 
of charcoal placed in the refrigerator, and renewed every three or four days, absorbs odors 
and keeps the air pure.

44 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Section III.— REFRIGERATOR 



If the refrigerator is kept in the cellar, the cellar should be frequently inspected, kept 
clean and well-aired, and if possible white-washed once or twice a year. A musty, damp, 
and ill-ventilated cellar is dangerous to health in any case. 

Dishes on Ice in refrigerator should have a small rubber mat under them and they 
will not slip as the ice melts. Preserve-jar rubber rings may be used for the purpose.

THE RELATIVE VALUE OF FOODS 

Do you know the relative value of the foods you are feeding your family? 
Do you know whether the meals administered to-day yield as much nourishment 
as the ones of yesterday? It is a part of the education of every thorough house- 
wife to know just how one food compares with another as to its nutritiousness. 
The woman who has no comprehension of this often feeds her family for one 
week meals with too much protein, making them feel heavy and stupid, while the 
whole of next week's meals may not contain as much real value as one single 
menu from the preceding week. 

A Chart Necessary. — You should consult frequently your chart of food values, 
and when you go out of a morning to do your marketing consider your chart before you 
decide on the menus for the day, so that they will contain the proper amount of nourish- 
ment. 

Fat» contain more energy than any other food, but their work is slow. The fats we 
consume go to make up the storehouse of our physical strength. We do not feel any imme- 
diate after-effect from eating a pork chop, a few slices of bacon or a good bit of butter, but 
this fat enters the storehouse of our bodies and stays there until needed, it is the strength 
from the fatty foods that we draw upon in time of illness. When we cannot eat for any 
length of time the body lives upon the energy laid up in reserve from the fats we have 
taken into our systems. 

Meats, however, contain the energy for our daily use. We need a daily amount of 
meats, fish or eggs, all of which hold the same kind of strength. The energy in meats lasts 
through one day, but needs replenishing for the next. 

Vegetables are as necessary as the meats and fats. Without them our bodies would 
become clogged from the fats and the circulation too violent from the meats. Vegetables 
serve to clear the system and to calm the blood. 

Mineral Salts — Such vegetables as spinach, celery, onions, carrots, etc., and such 
fruits as rhubarb, cranberries, etc., contain the necessary mineral salts which act as tonics 
and laxatives. Each one has its special office and its own particular value. Spinach, for 
instance, contains a great deal of iron; onions and celery are nerve foods; rhubarb takes the 
place of "sulphur and molasses" for clearing the blood, and cranberries are an excellent tonic. 

Making Up Menus — In making up the menus, therefore, you must be careful to have 
them balance evenly. You should not have too much fat one day, too much starch the 
next. The menus for one day should hold part of each kind of food — one meat (fish or 
eggs), one fat, one starch, one tonic vegetable and one laxative or fruit. 



MEAT EATERS OR VEGETARIANS? 

For many hundreds of years the argument has been bandied back and 
forth as to whether we best subsist on a meat or vegetable diet. It is about as 
absurd as whether we should wear hats or shoes. Each has its place. It is not a 
matter of classification but of what the respective foods contain and how they are 
balanced as to their ingredients. 

The most vehement partisan of the meat diet will admit that flesh is not indispens- 
able to our existence. And it is well known that the original Indian inhabitants of this 
country subsisted for many months at a time, in perfect health, solely on "pemmican" — dried 

49 



50 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Section IV.— Part 1— TALKS ON FOODS 

buffalo meat. The Esquimaux can live entirely on whale blubber; they could not subsist 
on the exclusive fruit diet of the tropics. Thus climate has its influence. We of the temper- 
ate zones may well employ, on this argument, a mixed diet, of both meats and vegetables. 

It is of no moment that the rabid advocate of each extreme can point to any number 
of exceptional cases, to prove his contentions — and to equally numerous ones of ill results 
from adherence to the diet the particular extremist seeks to condemn. 

But it is not so much a question of whether the source of the food is meat or vege- 
tables; the food itself is the albumen, fats, salts, etc., that are extracted in the process of 
digestion. 

Nature has made albumen the staple of nutrition for man. Fruit albumen is some- 
what more assimilible than meat albumen. Hence fruit forms nearly a perfect food, espe- 
cially as it also furnishes acids and salts which are much needed, in better proportions than 
meats. 

As to breads, a series of experiments show that in equal portions of 1 00 ounces more 
of white bread is digested than brown bread, but the proportions of proteids, which are 
the muscle-forming contents, 85!/2 ounces out of 100 is digested from white bread against 
88 '/4 from brown bread. The brown bread is therefore more valuable in the item of digest- 
ibility of its protein contents; and it is well understood that whole-wheat and graham 
breads contain the intensely valuable mineral salts which are largely or wholly "refined" 
out of the most of our white bread in the flour-making process. 

Nuts are an excellent diet if well masticated. They are highly valuable as nut but- 
ter or nut oils. They contain a large percentage of proteids as well as fats, in almost perfect 
purity. They are deficient in starch, but so are meats. Nuts will take the place of meats to 
perfection. But nuts must be masticated thoroughly — something seldom done with nuts. 
And they are really too concentrated to constitute an exclusive diet; they do not give the 
digestive functions proper exercise. Nature demands a certain amount of bulk, especially in 
the intestinal canal to excite peristalsis and stimulate bowel movement. 

Vegetables best furnish this bulk — also the mineral salts needed for the toning up 
of the blood, and whole wheat bread, because of the bran, is of value in this regard — the 
stimulation of peristalsis. 

Food Ingredients are classified in four divisions: I, Proteins; 2, Fats; 3, Starches, 
or Carbohydrates; 4, Mineral Salts. The classification is more clearly and specifically sub- 
divided as per chart on page opposite.

THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Section IV.— Part I— TALKS ON FOODS 



PROTEIN FOODS 

The first class of foods, the proteins, includes 
those which have tissue building for their chief pur- 
pose. They are essential for maintenance and for 
body growth as they are the only source of nitro- 
gen. Therefore they are necessary for the grow^ing 
child and for the athlete in the development of 
strong, vigorous muscles. The more easily digested 
protein foods are advised for the tubercular patient 
w^hose muscles and tissues have become debilitated 
by disease. 

Proteins are required by each individual but in 
varying amounts, to suit age, occupation, condition 
of system, and climate. The value of a mixed pro- 
tein diet is urged by the best authorities, rather 
than the diet which contains but one protein food. 

OVER USE OF PROTEIN FOODS 

It is true that a high per cent, of illness is caused 
by an accumulation of wastes in the body. It is 
also true that protein foods leave a higher per cent. 
of waste material in the body than any other class 
of foods. It foUow^s, then, that an over-use of pro- 
tein foods overworks the excretory organs and 
tends to w^eaken them. The weakened excretory 
organs are unable to take care of the waste prod- 
ucts, and as a result the system is affected by poi- 
sonous w^astes w^hich are produced by putrefaction 
in the intestines. A person in this condition is 
more liable to have rheumatism, gout, kidney and 
liver diseases than one in normal condition. 

A SHORT STUDY OF PROTEIN FOODS 

Some Common Forms Some Sources 

Albumen Eggs 

Casein Milk 

Myosin, fibrin and elastin Meat 

Gluten Wheat 

Tuberin Potato 

Legumin Peas and beans 

Excelsin Brazil nuts 

Zein Corn 

Milk contains a small amount of protein. In a 
glass of about 12 tablespoons of milk, there is less 
than 1 tablespoon of protein. 

Egg contains nearly as much protein as lean 
meat. 

Fish and meat are approximately equal so far as 
amount of protein and digestibility are concerned. 
Experiments show very little difference. 

Cheese varies in protein content from 18 to 25 
per cent. Cheese is a valuable food but should be 
used wisely. It is not the food for children or for 
those of delicate digestion. 

Peas, dried, contain 24.6 per cent, of protein. 
Green peas, cooked, contain 6.7 per cent. 

Lima beans, dried, contain 18.1 per cent.; green 
lima beans, 7. 1 per cent. 



Wheat contains protein in the form of gluten. 
Bread flour contains more of gluten than pastry 
flour. 

IMPORTANT STEPS IN DIGESTION 

OF PROTEIN 

Proteins. 

Meta proteins. 

Proteoses. 

Peptones. 

Peptids. 

Amino-acids. 

The action of digestive agents results in the 
final breaking down into the simple "building 
stones" called amino acids. They are spoken of 
as "building stones" because they are stored away 
and used in the building of new protein tissue. 
The digestion of proteins is a complex process and 
cannot be accomplished except with perfect co- 
operation between the digestive, circulatory, ex- 
cretory, respiratory, and nervous systems. 

FATS AND CARBOHYDRATES 
(Chief Fuel Foods) 

Under this head consideration will first be given 
to the class of foods spoken of in the outline as fats. 
These foods produce heat-energy in the body, very 
much as w^ood and coal produce heat in the stove. 
Fats and carbohydrates are also of value as fatty 
tissue builders but their chief function is the pro- 
duction of heat. 

Energy value to the body — 9 calories per gram, 
or 4082 calories per pound. Fats have more than 
twice the energy value of protein or carbohydrate. 
Butter, egg-fat and cod liver oil are especially valu- 
able fats for growth because of certain elements 
which they contain. The amount of fat required 
depends upon, condition of system, amount and 
kind of work done, age, climatic condition and 
amount of carbohydrate used. 

Amount Required 

The good housekeeper regulates the amount of 
wood or coal to suit the climatic conditions. She 
would be considered a very unw^ise manager if she 
used wood and coal enough to keep her stove red 
hot in the summer time. This would be a waste of 
both fuel and stove. The housekeeper makes a 
much more serious mistake w^hen she provides just 
as much fuel food in summer as in winter. This 
practice results in waste of food and injury to the 
body. 

The foods classed under the head of fats are 
most easily digested when uncooked ; for example, 
cream, butter, olive oil, and egg yolk. For this 
reason, these particular fats are advised for the 
person w^hose system has become w^eakened by ill- 
ness or overwork. These fats are readily digested 
and give heat very readily. 

Well cooked bacon is also a very easily digested 
fat. 



TALKS ON FOODS— THE RELATIVE VALUE OF FOODS 



53 



Other foods that are important as heat producers 
are other forms of fat meat, nuts, and eggs. Baked 
beans with pork provide a kind of food which is 
most wisely used in cold weather by active, strong 
adults. 

The second class of fuel foods, given in the out- 
line, is carbohydrates. They occur in starch, sugar, 
and celluloses. 

Proteins also furnish fuel, but their chief func- 
tion is tissue building. It would be unwise to 
supply the fuel needs of the body with proteins be- 
cause of the expense and the greater tax on the 
system. 

The principal starchy foods are the cereals; 
rice, corn, wheat, oats, barley, rye. Peas, beans, 
and potatoes also supply starch. In the chart fol- 
lowing it may be seen that the potato contains less 
starch than is ordinarily considered since about 
three-fourths of the potato is Vk'ater. 

The other vegetables that are of special value as 
fuel foods are sweet potatoes, parsnips, beets, car- 
rots, and squash. 

Some fruits may properly enter into this list be- 
cause of the high per cent, of starch and sugars 
they contain. Fruits containing sugars are prunes, 
dates, figs, raisins, apricots. Bananas contain 
starch and sugars. 

Over-Use of Carbohydrates 

If too much sugar and starch are eaten, fer- 
mentation may take place and interfere with diges- 
tion. Too much sugar and starch overworks the 
liver. 

Because sweet foods have the quality of satisfying 
the appetite very readily, they should not be taken 
to satisfy hunger but should rather be eaten after 
sufficient body building and body regulating foods 
have been taken to meet the body's need for such 
foods. The custom of serving the sweet food at 
the last of the meal is in harmony with this dietetic 
principle. 

It is important that children should form sane 
habits of eating sweet foods. The practice of using 
large amounts of sugar on cereals, cooked fruits 
and in beverages should be discouraged. 

The over-use of sugar irritates the lining of the 
digestive tract. This is caused by the abstraction 
of >vater from the mucuous lining. Sugar is one- 
sided in its value, consequently it is much wiser to 
obtain a high per cent, of heat from foods which 
serve other purposes as well. 

VALUE OF FRUIT AND VEGETABLES 

Vegetables contain protein, starch, sugar, cellu- 
lose, mineral matter, water and undetermined 
substances. 

Fruits contain (chiefly) sugar, cellulose, mineral 
matter, and water. 

Water removes wastes, lubricates tissues, aids in 
forming secretions, helps to equalize the tempera- 
ture. 



Acids help to maintain the alkalinity of the blood 
— stimulate the appetite. 

Mineral Salts. 

Build bone. 

Help to make blood alkaline. 

Aid in digestion. 

Aid in excretion. 

Build red blood cells. 

Build nerve tissue. 

Build cells. 

Cellulose exercises muscular lining of digestive 
tract. 

Note: Good authority makes the statement that 
the housekeeper is wise who pays as much for 
milk, vegetables, and fruit as for meat, eggs, and 
fish.

gard to choice of foods to suit the needs of the 
family. For example, if the family includes a child 
of 4 years, an active boy of 12, an office girl of 20, 
the father, who is an active outdoor worker, and 
an aged person of 90, these different members of 
the family require different kinds of food. 

Suggestions given indicate that the child of 4 
and the person of 90 require more nearly the same 
kind and amount of food than any other two 
members of the family. They require simply 
digested food in small amounts. Both w^ill thrive 
better if they have 5 very simple meals a day 
rather than 3 heavy ones. Five simple meals a 
day means a very light breakfast of perhaps some 
fruit and well-cooked cereal. The second meal 
at I o'clock may consist of a glass of milk w^ith a 
little bread. The third meal at noon may be an 
egg, a baked potato, and apple sauce. The fourth 
meal at 3 o'clock may be something equivalent to 
the meal at 10 o'clock, and the fifth meal at 6 
o'clock may be some bread and butter and a baked 
apple v^ith a glass of milk. 

If this family includes a semi-invalid, the prob- 
lem will be made niuch more complicated. One 
w^ho is weak bodily because of disease or over- 
work should take easily digested foods in moderate 
amount. Foods suitable for a person in that con- 
dition are also suitable for a child from 3 to 6 
years. Such foods include niilk, cream, butter, 
eggs, thoroughly baked bread, well cooked vege- 
tables and cereals, fruit, crisp bacon, with choco- 
late or coca as a beverage occasionally. From this 
list, a variety of menus can be worked out. If 
these foods are particularly good for a young child, 
and a semi-invalid, it must foIlow^ that the more 
closely this list is followed for the active adult, the 
more wisely the digestive system is treated. 

Simple, well cooked foods are the most import- 
ant. Serve a few^ dishes at one meal and make 
the meals as varied as possible. In general cost of 
food, age, occupation, climatic conditions and ab- 
normal conditions are the points which must be 
considered in order that the family may be fed as 
wsely as it is possible for it to be fed. 

Endeavor to distribute the protein, fat, and car- 
bohydrate through the day so that no meal will 
have a striking preponderance of one kind of food- 
stuff. 

For example, meat served with macaroni and 
cheese concentrates the protein in one meal, pota- 
toes with rice concentrate the starch, and fried 
potatoes and pie concentrate the fat. 

With the exception of a few^ such staples as 
bread, butter, and milk, try to avoid serving any 
food in the same form tw^ice in the same day. 

Try to avoid serving any food which gives char- 
acter to a dish twice in the same meal, even in 
different forms. Do not, for instance, select tomato 
soup and tomato salad for the same meal.

HOW TO SELECT FOOD 
GENERAL SUGGESTIONS 

From "What the Body Needs." 
Farmers' Bulletin No. 808. U. S. Department of Agriculture. 

It is believed that it is impossible to plan the meals for a family wisely 
without at least as much knowledge of how different kinds of food serve the 
body as the above bulletin gives and that the safest short cut to good planning lies 
in considering foods in the five groups therein described. Ways of making econ- 
omical use of the materials in each group cannot be here discussed, but a few gen- 
eral suggestions for getting the most for one's money in the matter of food may 
be given. 

Use cereals (flour, meal, cereal breakfast foods, etc.) freely, taking pains to prepare 
them with great care and to vary the kind used from day to day if necessary to keep people 
from tiring of them. 

Remember that a quart of whole milk a day for each child, to be used as a beverage 
and in cookery, is not too much. 

Remember that while skim milk should never be substituted for whole milk as the 
principal food in a child's diet, it is as valuable as whole milk as a source of protein and 
mineral matters in the general diet. 

Remember that except in the case of milk for children, the amount needed of foods 
specially useful for body-building purposes — that is, meat and meat substitutes, fruits and 
vegetables — is not large, but what is needed is needed very much. 

Do not be ashamed to plan closely. Thrift in food means providing enough food, 
neither too little nor too much. 

Notice carefully how much of such staples as flour, sugar, milk, cooking fat, etc., is 
used each week for a month, and see if there are any ways of cutting down the quantity con- 
sumed. 

Buy non-perishable materials in quantity if better prices can be secured and there is 
a good storage place in the house. Neighbors can sometimes club together to get lower 
prices. 

Try to make the dishes served of such size that there will be enough to satisfy the 
appetite of the family and no unnecessary table and plate waste. 

Do not be above noticing whether anything usable is thrown away with the garbage, 
which always shows how thriftily food is used in the home. 

Many inexpensive materials can be made attractive, and the diet can be pleasantly 
varied by the use of different flavorings. 

"Finicky " tastes in food often prevent the use of many valuable materials which 
might be the means of saving money. 

Good food habits are an important part of personal hygiene and thrift. Children 
get such habits by having suitable amounts of suitable foods served to them and then being 
expected to eat what is set before them. 

True economy lies not alone in buying wisely but also in making the fullest possible 
use of what is bought.

FRESH FRUITS AND VEGETABLES 

CONSERVERS OF OTHER STAPLE FOODS 

(Extracts from Farmers' Bulletin 871, U. S. Department of Agriculture) 

Under the present unusual conditions, when it is desirable to save staple 
foods, and to reduce the amount of labor expended in transporting foods, special 
attention should be given to the possibility of using perishable food materials, par- 
ticularly vegetables and fruits, near the place of their production. The use of 
these foods can be increased w^ithout lessening the food value or attractiveness of 
the diet or seriously altering food habits. 

In general peas, beans and similar legumes would be the most useful as 
protein (meat) savers; potatoes, sweet potatoes and similar vegetables as starch 
savers ; and fruits and sweet potatoes as possible sugar savers, while all fruits and 
green and succulent vegetables are valuable to supply the diet with mineral sub- 
stances, and with certain substances essential to health which are present in them 
and in many other foods in minute amounts. When vegetables are used to supply 
protein, it is important to supplement them with other food containing protein, 
and for this purpose milk, and particularly skim milk (so often a by-product, and a 
perishable one as well) is important. 

USES OF FRESH FRUITS AND VEGETABLES IN THE ORDINARY DIET 

Under ordinary conditions, I to 1 ^4 pounds of fresh fruits and vegetables (the 
equivalent of an apple or an orange, two medium-sized potatoes and an average sized help- 
ing of some other vegetable) is probably all that even a grown person really needs in the 
course of a day. He may desire more because of their fine flavor or refreshing character, 
but the necessary health-promoting substances would probably be obtained from the amount 
mentioned. These supply less than a tenth of all the fuel and the protein needed, but a rela- 
tively large part of the iron, calcium and phosphorus. 

USES OF FRESH FRUITS AND VEGETABLES IN EMERGENCY DIET 

In an emergency, when fresh fruits and vegetables are relatively abundant they may 
with advantage be used partly to replace cereals and sugar, and to a less extent meat. Under 
such circumstances it is the part of wisdom to examine the list of fruits and vegetables and 
*o see which can be used in a way so as to save cereals or sugar, and which used in such a 
way as to save meat. 

Fresh fruits and vegetables can be used in large quantities v^^ith little danger, provid- 
ing they are carefully cleaned and handled. It is even safe to say that there is absolutely no 
danger from the fruits and vegetables themselves, the only real difficulty lying in the fact that 
being bulky they quickly satisfy the appetite and sometimes lead people to believe they are 
supplied and to leave out of their diet the more substantial foods — meats, cereals, etc. — ^which 
are needed either for fuel or for body-building purposes. This fact should always be kept 
in mind in finding uses for these bulky foods.

CLASSinCATION OF STAPLE FOOD SAVERS 

Meat Savers — Shelled green peas, shelled green beans (Lima, kidney, etc.), 
shelled green cowpeas (common in the South) shelled green soy beans (common 
in the South). 

Cereal Savers — Potatoes, sweet potatoes, partially ripe bananas (cooked). 

Sugar Savers — Sweet potatoes, all fruits. 

USING SHELLED GREEN BEANS AND PEAS TO SAVE MEAT 

Beans and peas contain more protein than other fresh vegetables. This, however, is 
not the same as the proteins of meat, milk or egg, and should not be used to the exclusion of 
the others. When, however, beans and peas are freely used, less meat, milk and eggs are 
needed. For these reasons these vegetables are here called, not meat substitutes but meat 
savers. The following foods or combinations of foods, supply as much protein as one-fourth 
pound of beef of average composition: 

Eight or nine ounces of shelled green peas or beans. A large dish of green peas may 
be used in place of meat for dinner occasionally. Many persons like peas cooked with mint 
or served with mint sauce. 

One egg and 4 or 5 ounces of shelled green peas or beans. An omelet with peas 
(I egg and 1 cup peas per person) or a baked pea or bean souffle may be used as a meat 
substitute. 

One cup skim milk and 4 ounces shelled green peas or beans. A Lima bean chow- 
der made with skim milk is a good lunch or supper dish. 

USING POTATOES TO SAVE CEREALS 

A small potato (3 to 4 ounces) supplies as much starch as a large slice of bread 
( 1 ounce) but rather less protein. Potatoes eaten abundantly make it possible to get along 
with less bread. Potatoes can be substituted for about one-fourth of the wheat flour used in 
making ordinary bread and rolls. Recipes are given in the BREAD Section of this book; also 
in Farmers' Bulletin 807, Department of Agriculture. These call, however, for old rather 
than new potatoes. Mashed potatoes may be used in place of biscuit crust in making meat 
pies. Mashed potato sliced and fried may be used in place of bread and butter and makes 
a good breakfast dish. A very large variety of attractive salads may be made by combining 
potatoes with other vegetables — peas, beans, beets, cucumbers, radishes, onions, etc. Cot- 
tage cheese and potato salad go well together. This cheese has always been made in small 
quantities in the home, and now the Department of Agriculture is recommending to dairy- 
men that they make it as a means of utilizing their large quantities of skim milk. This should 
make cottage cheese a more common article of trade than it has been in the past. 

Sweet potatoes can be used in the same way as white potatoes. Bananas baked or 
fried supply considerable starch, though the amount cannot be exactly stated, because as the 
fruit ripens the starch changes to sugar. Green bananas peeled and boiled can be used like 
mashed potatoes, or may be sliced raw and fried. 

USING FRUITS TO SAVE SUGAR 

All ripe fruits contain sugar. The amount varies from about 3 ounces to one-fifth 
cup per pound in fresh figs and plums to about one-half ounce per pound in w^atermelon. 

If the water is driven off from fruits, as in the di-ying process, the sugar becomes far 
more prominent than it is in fresh fruits. Dried fruits therefore taste far sweeter than fresh 
ones and are for this reason often classed among the sweets. It should be remembered, how- 



60 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Section IV.— Part 1— TALKS ON FOODS 

ever, that sugar is present in all fresh fruits, even in the most acid ones, and that those per- 
sons who wish to do so can combine or economize on other kinds of sugar by eating large 
amounts of fresh fruits in unsweetened forms. 

In warm weather melons and other fruits may be used in place of "made" desserts, 
which usually contain both butter and sugar. Fruit and ice-cold junket, which can be pre- 
pared from skim-milk, make a refreshing dessert and utilize perishable foods chiefly. Or the 
dessert course may be omitted entirely and a fruit salad with cottage cheese may be used in 
its place. 

CONCLUSION 

When fresh fruits and vegetables are abundant and cheap they can be used in large 
enough amounts to effect an important saving of staple foods. If used intelligently, there is 
no danger that the diet will lack fuel or protein. Fresh legumes may be used to a certain 
extent in place of meat, potatoes in place of bread, and fruit in place of sugar. In connection 
with these foods, however, it is safe and highly desirable to use skim milk and its products, 
which like fresh fruits and vegetables are perishable and can be profitably used near the 
place of production. 



MILK: A CHEAP FOOD 

From Lesson HI., Food Series, Cornell Reading Course for the Farm Home (Extracts) 

College of Agriculture, Ithaca, N. Y. 

Milk is a cheap food. Furthermore, in any family dietary where the welfare 
of children as well as of adults is intelligently considered, it is almost a necessity. 

The proof that milk is a cheap food is not in the price paid for the quart. 
Even at fifteen or twenty cents a quart milk is a cheap source of certain nutritive 
substances always needed by the body, and particularly needed during the growth 
period. 

The increasing cost of many common foods leads to a temptation to reduce 
expenses by excluding those foods the prices of which seem prohibitive. It is an 
altogether unsafe practice, because the food thus eliminated may be, in spite of its 
seeming high cost, the cheapest possible source of some nutritive substance neces- 
sary to the health and welfare of the body. 

A study of the value of milk as a food and the particular part it should play 
in the dietary will serve as an illustration of the method that should be followed in 
determining the right of any food to a place in the daily meals. 



IS MILK A CHEAP SOURCE OF ENERGY? 

The energy that a food may yield is measured in terms of the Calorie. The greater 
number of Calories a digestible food will furnish for a given amount of money, the cheaper 
the food as a source of energy. 

If ten cents be spent and the particular need to be considered is that of energy, the 
problem is how to invest the ten cents in order to buy the most energy. 

Even figures showing energy values, however, must not influence one too much in 
estimating the cost of milk as an energy food, since two of the main sources of energy in 
milk, milk-fat and milk-sugar, besides their ability to yield energy, seem to have further sig- 
nificance in the dietary. Milk-sugar is believed to be of importance in holding in check putre- 
factive changes in the contents of the large intestine. This is particularly important in the 
case of the infant or young child who may be very susceptible to the injurious action of 
abnormal substances produced in the food canal. The fat of milk contains an unknown sub- 
stance essential for growth, and occurring in but few foods in amounts sufficient to promote 
normal growth. In considering the cost of milk as a source of energy, therefore, it is not 
entirely fair to forget these characteristics of two of its energy-yielding substances, since they 
play so important a part in human welfare, and particularly in the welfare of growing children. 



THE PROTEIN IN MILK 

The criticism sometimes indulged in of the cost of protein in milk, based entirely on 
comparative tables of protein contents only, would be convincing if it were not for the cer- 
tain facts recently made clear about protein. Protein is a name given to a group of sub- 
stances differing rather widely in their value to the body. Two foods may contain the same 
amount of protein; but an ounce of the protein from the first food may be much more valu- 
able in building and repairing tissue than an ounce of the protein from the second food. 

61 



62 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Section IV.— Part I— TALKS ON FOODS 

Milk is a decidedly superior source of protein for general human consumption and is a par- 
ticularly good source where growth is taking place; the amount of protein required in the 
daily dietary may be less if milk forms a considerable part of the diet than if such foods as 
cereals are mainly depended on; milk is not an expensive source of protein. 

MILK AS A SOURCE OF UME 

Milk as a protein-jrielding food can be replaced in the dietary more easily than milk 
as a lime-yielding food. Comparatively few common foods contain, in the amounts that can 
be eaten and digested by a child, a sufficient quantity of lime to provide for normal growth 
and health. 

Milk is the richest in available lime of all the common foods, and its absence in the 
family dietary or its use in very limited quantities may prove to be an expensive procedure 
£is well as an unsafe one. The abundance of lime in milk makes it at eight cents a quart the 
cheapest possible source of lime, and at even fifteen or twenty cents a quart a very cheap 
source of lime. 

When therefore in a family having growing children the statement is made that the 
increasing cost of milk must cause a reduction in the amount of milk used, the housekeeper 
should be urged to consider the lime needs of the children before she seeks to reduce expenses 
in this way. 

Of course if all members of the family are adults, a lessened amount of milk may not 
be serious, but even here thought must be given to provide lime in other foods in order that 
adult welfare may not be impaired. 

MILK AS A SOURCE OF PHOSPHORUS AND IRON 

Milk is comparatively rich in phosphorus as well as in lime, and forms an important 
and cheap source of this valuable element. Milk is low in iron, and when it forms any con- 
siderable part of the diet it should be associated with foods rich in iron. In spite of its low 
iron content, it is an important food to use v^^hen the blood is low in iron, because lime in food 
is believed to increase the ability of the body to utilize iron. The question is frequently raised: 
Why, if milk is low in iron, does a baby thrive on it so well as the only source of nutriment? 
The answer is found in the fact that at birth the healthy baby has a stored surplus of iron in 
its body, which normally will last it through a period of nine to twelve months of maternal 
nursing. 

IS MILK A CHEAP SOURCE OF BODY-REGULATING SUBSTANCES? 

The term body-regiilating substances is used to cover all the nutrients that play a part 
in keeping the machinery of the body in working order. The beating of the heart, the circu- 
lation of the blood, the ability to grow and reproduce, the ability to digest and absorb food, 
may all be classed as body processes regulated by certain substances furnished by food. 
All nutrients contained in food undoubtedly have some part to play as body-regulating sub- 
stances. Protein, phosphorus, iron and lime not only serve as conspicuous materials for build- 
ing the body, but play a second part in regulating its activities. Salts, acids, flavors, are all 
concerned in regulating body processes. 

THE SO-CALLED VITAMINES IN MILK ESSENTIAL TO GROWTH 

In the past two years some results of deepest importance to human welfare have been 
accomplished showng that besides all the nutrient substances that are now familiar, such as 
protein, fat, starch, lime, acids, salts and flavors, there are other dietary factors essential to 



TALKS ON FOODS— MILK: A CHEAP FOOD 63 

health and growth. Very little is known as yet about these factors that some foods seem to 
contain and others seem to lack, except that when the foods containing them are 
absent from the dietary, the young animal ceases to grow and the adult animal 
suffers in health. One serious disease of nutrition, beriberi, so common in some Eastern rice- 
producing countries, has been traced to the too exclusive use of polished rice, which lacks 
these dietary factors. Other nutritive diseases somewhat like beriberi, and occurring in this 
country, may be proved to be similarly caused. 

A popular name, vitamines, has been given to these essential dietary factors, and is 
referred to now because many persons may have heard it used. The name vitamine is, how- 
ever not accepted as either good or descriptive by many of the persons doing the most work 
on this subject, and consequently is only mentioned in passing. 

There seem to be two of these factors essential to right nutrition. One of them 
occurs dissolved in the fat of certain foods; the other one can be obtained from certain 
foods dissolved in water. They are designated for convenience "fat-soluble A" and "water- 
soluble B." 

THE FAT-SOLUBLE GROWTH-PROMOTING FACTOR IN MILK 

The fat-soluble factor that promotes growth and is essential to it, does not occur in 
all fats. This necessarily points to decided differences in the value of certain sources of fat. 
Milk-fat as it occurs in milk and butter and probably cheese, the fat in egg-yolk, cod-liver oil, 
and to a considerably lesser extent muscle and kidney fat, contain the needed factor. Forage 
foods, such as alfalfa and cabbage leaves, seem to contain it in abundance. It seems to be 
absent or deficient in lard and all vegetable oils. 

When this knowledge is summed up into usable form, it results in this statement: 
That since the human being has a limited capacity for forage foods, such as alfalfa and cab- 
bage, since he must have this essential factor in his diet to some extent in adult life and to a 
much larger extent in childhood, and since it is absent or deficient in the grains that he uses 
as food, he must depend primarily on milk, eggs and meat for his supply. Further, since 
meat contains a smaller amount of this factor than milk or eggs, the two foods last men- 
tioned take first rank as its sources. For the reason that meat contains this factor in lesser 
quantity than does milk-fat, oleomargarine, although having the same energy value as butter, 
is less valuable than butter as a source of the fat-soluble A. 



THE WATER-SOLUBLE GROWTH-PROMOTING FACTOR IN MILK 

The second factor essential to growth, the water-soluble factor, is also absent from 
certain foods; and in its absence not only is growth prevented, but as in the case of the too 
exclusive diet of polished rice in India, serious illness results. 

This water-soluble, growth-promoting factor, like the fat-soluble one, is present in 
amounts sufficient for growth in milk and eggs. It occurs in considerable amounts in the 
embryo of the cereal grains, but is absent in the grain from which the germ has been 
removed. 

When white bread, polished rice, or degerminated cereals form an important part of 
the diet, as they frequently do, some food must be added that contains the water-soluble, 
growth-promoting factor. Bread and milk make an excellent combination in this respect. 

SUMMARY 

With all the evidence in, no food bears the investigation of nutritive properties better 
than does milk. It is impossible to escape the conviction that not only is it a cheap food. 



64 



THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Section IV.— Part 1— TALKS ON FOODS 



but it is a food whose value can hardly be estimated in terms of dollars and cents. It has 
been pointed out that: 

1 . Although milk is not the cheapest source of energy that can be bought, it is 
nevertheless an important source of energy, and the energy-yielding substances, the protein, 
the milk-sugar and the milk-fat, all have special value. 

2. Milk is a cheap source of protein because the protein that it contains is of a 
kind particularly valuable for building tissue. 

3. Ordinarily milk is the cheapest and most valuable source of lime, unless it is 
discovered that lime in water can take the place of lime in milk. 

4. Milk is a valuable and cheap source of phosphorus. 

5. Milk is deficient in iron, but the iron that it contains is particularly well utilized 
by the body. 

6. Milk is the miost important of the three foods, milk, eggs and meat, which are 
the chief sources of a factor in foods that is soluble in fat, that is essential to growth and 
health, and that is called **fat-soluble A.'* 

7. Milk is one of the most important sources of a factor in foods that is soluble 
in water, is essential to growth and health, and is called "water-soluble B."

TO PASTEURIZE MILK 



Set the bottles of milk in a pail with a perforated false bottom. An inverted 
perforated pie tin will do. Insert a thermometer in one of the bottles, by punch- 
ing a hole in the cap or through the cotton plug. Fill the pail with water nearly to 
the level of the milk. Heat the water sligthly until the thermometer registers 
I 50 F. Change the thermometer from the milk to the water, add cold water till 
the temperature of the water is also I 50 F. Cover the kettle, keeping it as nearly 
this temperature as possible for 30 minutes; then cool, by running w^ater into the 
pail . Remove the bottles and put them immediately on ice. 

If no thermometer is at hand, the following method may be followed: Put 
a gallon (4 quarts) of water on the stove in a kettle with a perforated false bottom. 
When the water is boiling hard, remove the kettle from the stove to a table and 
allow it to stand uncovered for 10 minutes; then put the filled and loosely corked 
bottles into the water, cover the kettle, and allow it to stand covered for half an 
hour. At the end of this time remove the bottles, cool rapidly under running 
water, and put in the ice box until needed. Do not uncork the bottle from the time 
it is first closed until the baby is to be fed. 



SUGAR: A VALUABLE FOOD 

(From Iowa State College of Agriculture Bulletin "Sugar") 

Sugar in its various forms constitutes one of the important food materials 
of the world. With the development of the sugar industry and the consequent 
cheapening of the product the consumption of sugar has increased at a very rapid 
rate. 

Manufacture 

The great bulk of the sugar used for household purposes is prepared by 
expressing the juice from crushed sugar canes or sliced beets, filtering the liquid, 
boiling it in a vacuum and clarifying by means of Hme, acid calcium phosphate and 
bone-black. 

Molasses is a product obtained in the process of refining sugar. 

Brown sugars are not completely refined. 

Granulated, loaf and pulverized sugars are the various forms in which 
refined sugar is prepared. 

COMPARATIVE VALUE OF CANE AND BEET SUGARS 

There is no difference in the nutritive value or purity of the different forms of sugar 
made from beets and sugar cane if they have undergone the same degree of refining. Cane 
and beet sugar are identical in composition, in sweetening power, in chemical reactions and 
in dietetic value. 

Failures in jelly making and candy making sometimes attributed to the use of beet 
sugar may usually be traced to other causes. 

SUGAR AS A FOOD 

Sugars are among the most valuable of the carbohydrate foods. Unlike the other 
fuel foods (starches and fats) they yield energy very readily. Some of the simple sugars 
such as glucose and fructose from honey and the fruits, are ready for body use as soon as 
dissolved. These pass into the blood stream by absorption through the wails of the intes- 
tine and become available for body needs at once. 

The more complex sugars, sucrose, lactose and maltose, are acted upon by digestive 
ferments which change them to glucose and fructose, thereby preparing them for absorption. 
All of the sugars, and the starches as well, must be in the form of glucose or other kindred 
sugars before the body can convert them into energy. It will be seen, therefore, that pure 
glucose is a wholesome and easily assimilated food. 

Honey consists largely of fructose and has a mildly laxative effect, hence, is a good 
substitute for some of the sucrose in the diet. 

Lactose (milk sugar) is only slightly sweet in taste and does not ferment so readily 
as other sugars. For these reasons it is used extensively in the preparation of foods for in- 
fants and invalids. 

65 



66 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK — Section IV. — Part 1— TALKS ON FOODS 

MODERATION IN THE USE OF SUGAR 

The increasing per capita consumption of sugar in the United States should serve as 
a warning against the dangers of a one-sided diet. 

Because sweet foods have the quahty of satisfying the appetite very readily, they 
should not be taken to satisfy hunger but should rather be eaten after sufficient body-build- 
ing and body-regulating foods have been taken to meet the body's need for such foods. The 
custom of serving the sweet food at the last of the meal is in harmony with this dietetic prin- 
ciple. 

It is important that children should form sane habits of eating sweet foods. The 
practice of using large amounts of sugar on cereals, cooked fruits and in beverages should be 
discouraged. The cereal foods are more wholesome and better balanced when served with 
milk, cream or a little butter. Candy is more wisely allowed only at the close of a meal. 

Such fruits as dates, raisins and figs, which furnish the easily digested fruit sugar, 
are a better confection for children than the candies which consist chiefly of the less easily 
digested sucrose. These fruits furnish mineral matter in addition to sugar. 

Concentrated sweet foods are less apt to cause irritation and fermentation in the 
digestive tract if taken with large amounts of water. 

Menus rich in sugar should not include large amounts of fat and starch. Menus rich 
in starch and fat should not include large amounts of sugar. 



SUGAR AND ITS VALUE AS FOOD 

(From U. S. Farmers' Bulletin 535) 

MILK SUGAR 

Milk contains from 4 to 5 per cent, of an important sugar — milk sugar or 
lactose. When separated or purified it is a crystalline product and is sold in that 
form. It is said to be the most readily digestible sugar and is often found in pre- 
pared foods, especially those made for invalids and children. It is much less 
sweet than cane sugar. 

HONEY 

Before sugar was a common commercial product, honey, stored by the honey bee, 
was very generally used to sweeten foods. Although its use for this purpose is much less 
common since cane sugar has become so plentiful and cheap, honey is still highly prized as a 
wholesome sweet food and is used either alone or with other foods in a great many ways. 
Its flavor is due to volatile bodies in the flowers from which it is obtained, some flowers 
imparting a more agreeable flavor than others to the honey. Its behavior in cooking and 
storing is different from that of tbe ordinary sugars for reasons not yet thoroughly under- 
stood. Honey has been used as a food from the earliest times, and is generally conceded 
to be wholesome as well as palatable. Prior to the passage of the Federal Pure Food Law, 
in 1906, strained honey was very frequently adulterated with commercial glucose and other 
materials, such as commercial invert sugar, but since this law went into effect there is little 
adulteration of this product. Mixtures with glucose and invert sugar are sold, but the law 
requires that they be so labeled. 

SWEET MATERIALS OTHER THAN SUGAR 

Saccharin, an extremely sweet material, is not a sugar, but is of an entirely different 
chemical structure, being a benzene compound. Its use in food products was forbidden 
under the Federal Pure Food Law. It is quite commonly prescribed in cases of diabetes to 
satisfy the craving for sweets, as it is believed to be less harmful in such cases than the 
sugar, the flavor of which it replaces. 

There are other chemical substances which are not sugars, but which have a marked 
s^veet flavor. They, like saccharin, are in no sense foodstuffs. 

GLUCOSE AND OTHER PRODUCTS MADE FROM STARCH 

"Commercial glucose," "40 sugar," "80 sugar," and "commercial dextrose" are 
commercial products of the hydrolysis of starch. The first is a thick liquid, rarely showing 
crystallization. 

Commercial glucose is often used as a substitute for sugar in syrups, candy making, 
preserving, etc. Confectioners maintain that certain kinds of candy cannot be made of as 
good consistency with pure cane sugar as with the addition of some glucose. In such cases 
it can hardly be considered an adulterant. When it is used as a cheaper substitute for cane 
sugar, and the goods are sold as cane-sugar products, its use is evidently fraudulent. The 
present law in the United States requires that syrups, jams, jellies, etc., made with glucose 
shall be so labeled. Its nutritive value is practically the same as that of other carbohydrates, 
and there is no reason to suppose that when properly made it is not wholesome. 

67 



68 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Section IV.— Part 1— TALKS ON FOODS 



PURITY OF SUGAR 

Of 500 samples of sugar examined several years ago by the Bureau of Chemistry 
of this department, not one was found to be adulterated. The low price of cane sugar, in 
comparison with the price of substances that might be used for adulteration, protects it from 
such attempts. 

A more recent publication of the Bureau of Chemistry states that sugars as a class, 
both the high and low grades as now found on the market, are practically free from adulter- 
ation. This is particularly true since the Federal Pure Food Law of 1906 went into effect. 

There is a popular belief that granulated sugar is often adulterated with white sand 
or finely ground rock, and that pulverized sugar is commonly adulterated with starch or lime 
dust. Cases of such adulteration, however, have rarely been found by the Bureau of Chem- 
istry, though starch has been detected in a very few samples of powdered sugar. It is a very 
simple matter to test suspicious sugar for the presence of such materials. Sugar is readily 
soluble in water, and the sand and mineral adulterants are insoluble. 

FOOD VALUE OF SUGAR 

The most interesting use of sugar is as a food for the animal body. Within certain 
limits, sugar may be considered as the equivalent of starch that has been digested and made 
ready for absorption. A mealy boiled potato like all forms of starchy food, must be largely 
converted into some kind of sugar by the digestive juices before it can be absorbed as food. 

DIGESTION OF SUGAR 

When sugar is eaten it is changed in the digestive tract before it is taken up in the 
blood and carried where it is needed. If a solution of cane sugar be injected directly into 
the blood, it is passed out by the kidneys unchanged, showing that it is not fitted for assimi- 
lation until it has been changed, as it is in normal digestion. 

SUGAR AS A FOOD FOR MUSCULAR WORK 

Food must supply enough protein or nitrogenous material for the formation and 
repair of tissues and for certain other uses in the body. 

According to our present knowledge the value of sugar as a food for muscular work 
may be briefly summarized as follows: 

When the organism is adapted to the digestion of starch, and there is sufficient time 
for its utilization, sugar has no advantage over starch as a food for muscular work. 

In small quantities and in not too concentrated form sugar will take the place, prac- 
tically weight for weight, of starch as a food for muscular work, barring the difference in 
energy and in time required to digest them, sugar having the advantage in these respects. 

It furnishes the needed carbohydrate material to organisms that have little or no 
power to digest starch. Thus, milk sugar is part of the natural food of the infant whose 
digestive organs are, as yet, unable to convert starch into an assimilable form. 

In times of great exertion or exhausting labor, the rapidity with which it is assimi- 
lated gives sugar certain advantages over starch and makes it prevent fatigue. 

This latter quality, which renders it more rapidly available for muscular power, may 
account for the fact that sugar is so relished by people who are doing muscular work, and by 
those of very active habits, such as children. 



TALKS ON FOODS — SUGAR AND ITS VALUE AS FOOD 69 

The American farmer ranks high among agriculturists as a rapid and enduring worker, 
and his consumption of sweets is known to be very large. The same is true of lumbermen 
and others who work hard in the open air; sugar and sweet cakes are favorite foods with 
them. Dietary studies carried on in the winter lumber camps of Maine showed that large 
quantities of cookies, cakes, molasses, and sugar were eaten, sugar of all sorts supplying on 
an average 1 per cent of the total energy of the diet. 

The value of sugar in cold climates, where foods containing starch are not available, 
is evident, and in the outfit of polar expeditions sugar is now given an important place. 

SUGAR AS A FAT FORMER 

Sugar, like starch, is fattening; that is, when taken in excess it may be transformed 
into fat and stored as reserve material. On this account physicians commonly advise that 
sugar be sparingly used by the corpulent. This advice is given because sugar in the form of 
candy or other sweets is often taken as an accessory to an already abundant diet. 

SUGAR AS A FLAVOR 

In addition to its value as a food, sugar is important in the diet as a flavor, one 
which the cook could not easily spare, as it now enters into a great variety of dishes. In- 
deed its agreeable flavor has always constituted one of the chief reasons for its use, and will 
continue to do so, even though we make use of the abundance of relatively cheap starchy 
materials which we possess which theoretically may readily take the place of sugar as a food. 

In some dietary studies made under the auspices of this department with a club of 
students at the University of Maine, an investigation was made of the effect of supplying a 
liberal amount of maple syrup in a diet which contained an abundance of nutrients. The 
syrup was evidently relished, and considerable amounts were eaten. However, there was 
not a corresponding decrease in other foods; on the contrary, the amount of flour was in 
excess of the amount ordinarily consumed. It would seem that the maple syrup, and flour 
in the form of griddle cakes, were consumed simply on account of their agreeable flavor. 
Provided the deit contained sufficient nutrients in the first place, this increase was not desir- 
able on the ground of economy, and it may be questioned whether it was desirable from the 
standpoint of health. When a similar comparison was made of the addition to the diet of 
liberal quantities of milk, which has a much less distinctive flavor, there was a corresponding 
decrease in the amount of other foods consumed. This would indicate that much of the sugar 
used is consumed for its agreeable flavor and not because it is recognized as a food which is 
required to satisfy body needs. 

GENERAL CONCLUSIONS 

One may say in general that the wholesomeness of sweetened foods and their utiliza- 
tion by the system is largely a question of quantity and concentration. For instance, a simple 
pudding flavored with sugar rather than heavily sweetened is considered easy of digestion, 
but when more sugar is used, with the addition of eggs and fat, we have as the result highly 
concentrated forms of food, which can be eaten with advantage only in moderate quantities 
and which are entirely unsuited to children and invalids. 

It is true that the harvester, lumberman, and others who do hard work in the open 
air consume great amounts of food containing considerable quantities of sugar, such as pie 
and doughnuts, and apparently with impunity; but it is equally true that people living an 
indoor life find that undue amounts of pie, cake, and pudding, with highly sweetened pre- 
served fruit, and sugar in large amounts on cooked cereals, almost always bring indigestion 
sooner or later. 



70 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK — Section IV— Part 1— TALKS ON FOODS 



From a gastronomic point of view it would seem also that in the American cuisine 
sugar is used with too many kinds of food, with a consequent loss of variety and piquancy 
of flavor in the different dishes. The nutty flavor of grains and the natural taste of mild 
fruits are very often concealed by the addition of large quantities of sugar. 

In the diet of the undernourished larger amounts of sugar would doubtless help to 
supply adequate nutrition. This point is often urged by European hygienists. In the food 
of the well-to-do it is often the case, however, that starch is not diminished in proportion as 
sugar is added. That sugar, on account of its agreeable flavor, furnishes a temptation to 
take more carbohydrate food than the system needs cannot be denied. The vigor of diges- 
tion and muscular activity in each particular case would seem to suggest the limit. A lump 
of sugar represents about as much nutriment as an ounce of potato, but, while the potato will 
be eaten only because hunger prompts, the sugar, because of its taste, may be taken when 
the appetite has been fully satisfied. 

Sugar is a useful and valuable food. It must, however, be remembered that it is a 
concentrated food, and therefore should be eaten in moderate quantities. Further, like other 
concentrated foods, sugar seems best fitted for assimilation by the body when supplied with 
other materials which dilute it or give it the necessary bulk. 

Persons of active habits and good digestion will add sugar to their food almost at 
pleasure without inconvenience, while those of sedentary life, of delicate digestion, or with a 
tendency to corpulency would do better to use sugar very moderately. It is generally 
assumed that 4 or 5 ounces of sugar per day is as much as it is well for the average adult 
to eat under ordinary conditions. 



FATS AND THEIR ECONOMICAL USE IN THE HOME 

(From U. S. Farmers' Bulletin 469) 

The fats in the ordinary diet fall naturally into two groups, those eaten be- 
cause they happen to be components of foods, like the fat in milk, meats, or fish, 
and those like butter, salad oils, or lard, which are added to other foods in cooking 
or serving. The housekeeper interested in the economical use of fats in the home 
must take into consideration fat as contributed by both groups. Obviously, the 
kind and quantity of the first group of fats eaten are determined by the foods 
making up the diet and this is governed largely by individual tastes and local or 
family food habits. As regards this group, economy involves chiefly the proper 
selection and combination of foods containing fat in abundance with other foods 
containing little of it, so as to secure a diet supplying the proper proportions of 
protein and carbohydrate as well as fat. 

The flavors and odors of fats are probably due to the presence in them of small 
amounts of difficultly removable substances rather than to specific properties of the pure fats 
themselves, in view of the fact that flavors and odors become much less noticeable the more 
completely the fats are purified. The characteristic flavor of butter, for example, is due to 
the absorption by the fat of the substances formed in the fermentation of milk and cream by 
lactic acid and bacteria and to the presence of small particles of the curd. Similarly, the by- 
products, such as butyric acid, which are formed by the action of undesirable bacteria, may 
be absorbed by the fat and give rise to the undesirable flavor of butter of poor quality or 
that which has deteriorated. Musty flavors are doubtless due to the presence of the products 
of metabolism of molds which may be present in the fats. In the case of some fats, like 
those of beef and mutton, or the fish oils, it has apparently been impossible to remove entirely 
the flavor-giving substances by the ordinary methods of refining. 



THE PLACE OF FATS IN THE DIET 

The chief value of fats in nutrition is that they furnish energy which the body requires 
to perform its work. The ideal diet should contain sufficient quantities of fat and carbo- 
hydrates to insure it the required amount of energy, as well as a sufficient quantity of protein 
to supply the necessary nitrogen for growth and repair of the body, also mineral matter for 
growth and other body needs, and vitamins or similar bodies required to render the diet 
adequate for maintenance. Since fats furnish 2 '/4 times as much energy, pound for pound, 
as do proteins and carbohydrates, and since they are both wholesome and palatable, they 
are very commonly used to increase the energo' value of the diet. Furthermore, they are 
especially useful as a source of energy where an excess of carbohydrates in the diet is to be 
avoided, as in cases of diabetes or certain forms of indigestion. 

While fats and carbohydrates may replace each other to a considerable extent, 
recent investigations indicate that some carbohydrate supplied by the food or formed in the 
body from protein is essential for the combustion of fats in the body. Experts in nutrition 
and dietetics, therefore, believe that neither one should be used to the exclusion of the other. 

The digestive disturbances often attributed to eating fat are probably due not so 
much to the inability of the body to digest the fat itself as to other factors, chief among 
which are bad cooking, overeating of foods containing fats, and rancidity. 

71 



72 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Section IV.— Part 1— TALKS ON FOODS 

Disagreeable sensations are experienced by some people after eating large quantities 
of foods such as meats containing much fat interspersed with the muscular tissue, and over- 
rich puddings or salads. This may be explained by the fact that the digestive juices of 
stomach have little solvent action on such nonemulsified fats and are thus hindered from 
digesting the protein which is covered by or very intimately mixed with the fat. The pass- 
ing of the food through the pylorus into the small intestine is thus delayed until the fat has 
become separated from the lean portions by the enzymic and mechanical action of the 
stomach. For this reason very fat meats, for instance, remain a longer time in the stomach 
than lean meats, although in the end they are as thoroughly digested. Similar digestive dis- 
turbances are sometimes experienced after eating fried foods (cooked without scorching) or 
foods in which fat is incorporated in such a manner that it prevents the digestive juices from 
acting upon the protein and carbohydrates. This delayed digestion is often mistaken for 
diminished or incomplete digestion. 

It must be remembered that there are some persons whose systems can tolerate little 
if any food rich in fats. This, like the inability of some to eat strawberries, onions, or other 
foods, without digestive disturbances, is a matter of individual peculiarity. 



OLEOMARGARINE 

A discussion of animal fats would not be complete without some mention of oleo- 
margarine, called "margarin" in Europe. The principal fats used in its manufacture in the 
United States are oleo oil, neutral lard (that is, a specially rendered lard), and cottonseed 
and other oils. All these ingredients must be pure and prepared with care in order that 
none of them shall have any marked taste or odor. These are mixed in such proportions as 
■will give the final product a melting point very near that of butter. After being thoroughly 
mixed the fats are churned with a small quantity of milk and sometimes cream, the propor- 
tions of these used depending upon the quality of the product desired. In the preparation of 
high-grade oleomargarine varying quantities of butter are also added. The resulting prod- 
uct is then washed, salted, and worked as in ordinary butter-making processes. Owing to 
the ease with which a highly colored oleomargarine might be sold as butter, it is illegal to 
sell oleomargarine unless it is plainly labeled as such, and the practice of coloring it to 
imitate butter is discouraged by a heavy tax. Oleomargarine is not used as extensively in 
this country as in Europe, where it serves both for table and culinary purposes. If prepared 
from pure materials and under sanitary conditions, it is a wholesome fat, which, according 
to European investigators, is well assimilated. It has an energy value of about 3,500 calories 
per pound. 



OUVE OIL 

The best grade, known as virgin oil, is obtained from perfect olives of the proper 
degree of ripeness. Lower grades may be obtained either by crushing and pressing an in- 
ferior quality of olives or by a second pressing of the residue from the first pressing of the 
better grades of fruit. The only refining or purification of the better grades of oil necessary 
is filtration to remove foreign matter. In the United States olive oil is used almost exclus- 
ively for table purposes, being a very common salad oil. In localities where it is produced, 
especially in Southern Europe, it is used for cooking as well as for table purposes, owing 
to the larger and more readily available supply (especially of the cheaper grades) and to 
the relatively limited supply of animal fat in such regions. 



TALKS ON FOODS— FAT AND THEIR ECONOMICAL USE 73 

COTTONSEED OIL 

Cottonseed oil in its crude form is obtained as a ruby or dark-red oil by subjecting 
the seeds of the cotton plant to great pressure. The refined oil was first utilized in the pre- 
paration of various lard substitutes by mixing with it hard animal fats to produce a substance 
having a consistency similar to lard. Other methods have been developed, and a wide 
variety of cooking fats prepared from cottonseed oil are now on the market. More recently 
salad oils have been prepared which are wholesome and palatable and are being used in 
increasing quantities for table purposes. 

NUT BUTTERS 

Closely related to the nut oils are the nut butters prepared by grinding finely the 
meats of peanuts, almonds, or other nuts rich in fat, so as to produce an oily mass much like 
butter in consistency. Peanut butter is by far the most common of the nut butters. It is 
used chiefly as a filling for sandwiches, crackers, etc., though it finds some use in cooking. 
The nut butters can be made at home by grinding the whole nuts; a special nut-butter knife 
being furnished with some of the meat or food choppers. In addition to containing a large 
amount of fat, nut butters also contain considerable protein. 

THE SELECTION OF EDIBLE FATS 

In the selection of edible fats the principle considerations should be the purpose 
for which the fat is to be used, quality, price, and individual preference, since the energy 
which the body derives from different fats is about the same, and all are regarded as 
wholesome when of good quality. Custom, which influences to a considerable extent the 
choice of all foods, can, therefore, be subordinated to the more essential consideration of 
economy. 

When purchasing fats for table use it should be remembered that they influence 
the wholesomeness of the foods with which they are served as well as the energy value 
and cost. The price of table fats depends largely upon their flavor and to a less extent on 
color, and in selecting them each housekeeper must decide how much she can afford to pay 
for these properties, since all the edible fats have practically the same energy value. 
In general it pays always to buy fats of such good quality that none will have to be thrown 
away through spoilage. In some instances a higher-priced article may be more economical 
in the end as, for example, clean, sanitary butter, as compared to a cheaper but less sanitary 
product. In some instances, where taste or flavor only is involved, a less expensive table 
fat may answer quite satisfactorily the purpose of a more expensive one. For example, the 
chief use of table oils is as an ingredient of salad dressings, and when a characteristic 
flavor is not especially desired, good grades of cottonseed and peanut oils, having a bland 
flavor, may be used, when these are less expensive than the corresponding grades of olive 
oil. 

Fats used for shortening influence the appearance, flavor, texture, composition, 
keeping quality, and cost of the foods in which they are incorporated. In selecting short- 
ening fats flavor and odor are to be considered, but attractive appearance and color are of 
less importance, since in cooking these are usually masked. Other qualities being equal, 
those culinary fats are more economical and desirable which possess the best keeping qual- 
ity; that is, the least tendency to become rancid. Also, for general use shortening fats give 
the best results if they are neither too hard nor too soft to be easily mixed with the other in- 
gredients of the dough at ordinary temperatures. 

Fats used as a medium for cooking should be carefully selected, since they in- 
fluence the flavor, appearance, and texture of the foods cooked in them, as is evident when 
one recalls the bad flavor imparted to fried foods by burned or rancid fat. Preference 



74 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Section IV.— Part 1— TALKS ON FOODS 

should be given to a fat which does not scorch too readily at the temperature most comnionly 
used for frying. Experiments in the laboratory of the Office of Home Economics indicate 
that butter and lard scorch at a lower temperature than beef or mutton fats and cottonseed, 
peanut or cocoanut oils. For this reason, therefore, the latter fats are preferable for deep 
frying, which requires high temperature. 

Prejudice often exerts an influence on the selection of fats as well as other food 
materials, and these prejudices are often curious. For example, some persons who think 
that lard is not only indigestible, but also unwholesome, nevertheless enjoy bacon, which, 
of course, supplies pork fat in a different form. Such prejudices have little or no basis of 
fact and should not exert too much influence on the selection of any food material. 

SUMMARY 

Economy of fats in the home may be secured by intelligent selection, economical 
use, and by the prevention of unnecessary waste. For intelligent selection, which means 
choosing the fat best suited for the purpose in question, a knowledge of the properties and 
prices of the different fats on the market is necessary. It should be remembered that the 
energy value of all the pure fats is practically the same, and the housekeeper must deter- 
mine how much she can afford to pay for particular flavors or appearance, on which the 
difference in price largely depends. To secure economy fats should be used primarily for 
the purposes to which they are best adapted, and the extravagant use of both table and 
cooking fats should be avoided. To prevent unnecessary waste fats should be carefully 
handled and stored so that none need be discarded through spoilage. Furthermore, all 
scraps of fat which accumulate in the home should be saved and used for culinary pur- 
poses wherever possible, thus lessening the amount of money expended for cooking fats. 
It should always be borne in mind that while an economical use of fat is to be desired, 
stinting is to be avoided. In determining how far economy in the use of fats is to be prac- 
ticed one should bear in mind that true economy is possible only where the value of the 
time and energy involved in the saving or utilizing of an article is less than the value of 
the articles saved. 



COMMON SENSE IN MODERN COOKING 

It is no longer considered sufficient that a girl should learn cooking only 
after the manner her mother attained it from her grandmother. Much that her 
grandmother knew was of high practical value, and while she did not know the 
scientific "why," yet in many cases we have never been able to improve on her 
"how." Her knowledge should properly pass on in the manner it does to the next 
generation. At the same time, the modern girl wants to know something of the 
simple chemistry of foods and the chemical changes that take place in cooking them. 

The health of the family may be undermined not only in the food factories 
that devitalize foods through various "refining" practices and in adulterations, but 
through faulty treatment in the kitchen of the best and freshest foods. 

One of the most serious and common mistakes to be avoided is the custom of 
"draining off" the water in which foods are cooked. Probably few do not commit this 
error. There are numerous ways to avoid it — use less water, or boil until the surplus passes 
off in the form of steam, leaving the natural salts behind, otherwise the most valuable nutri- 
tive elements are thrown away. 

We know now that the mineral salts, although constituting a small percentage in the 
total bulk of foods in proportion to the protein, fats and carbohydrates, are nevertheless of 
most vital importance. These are the original salts of iron, phosphorus, lime, potassium and 
other minerals. They are indispensable in maintaining a healthy condition of the blood, 
and in the manufacture of the brain, the nerves, the bones, the glands and their secretions. 

It is because of the very fact that the normal proportion of the mineral salts in any 
foods is small that they should not be drained or wasted away in cooking, No artificial 
"seasoning" with salt and pepper, butter and other additions, can restore the lost value of 
the natural salts — and the need of these seasonings to restore "taste" miraculously disap- 
pears to a large extent when the natural salts are retained with the flavor and "life" which 
they in themselves yield the palate. 

There is reason for the popularity of baked potatoes. The mineral salts are in and 

next to the skin. In eating them the skin should be scraped very close or itself eaten. 

Potatoes should never be peeled by paring off the skin; they are thus robbed of their 

highest value. If boiled and only the thinnest film of skin removed, this value is saved 

providing they are boiled down until little or no water remains to be drained off, or pro- 
vided they are mashed into the residue of juice or water and served in that manner. 

Steam cooking is simple; almost anything can be steamed. An ordinary colander 
covered with a saucepan may be used. The double boiler enables one to cook vegetables 
in their own juices with the addition of little or no water and no draining off. 

Baking is perhaps the most ideal form of treatment for many foods besides meats. 
It retains all of the natural juices and minerals and serves them in their most assimilable 
chemical condition.

THE ALL-CONVENIENT CASSEROLE 

AND 

THE USE OF THE OVEN 

Under the head of Casserole come Marmites, Cocottes, Ramekins, au Gratin 
Dishes, and Souffle Cases. 

Almost everything can be cooked en casserole — meat, fish, vegetables, poul- 
try, fruit, cereals — anything requiring slow, gentle cooking. The flavor of re- 
cooked meats is far superior thus than if prepared in a saucepan, and the slow 
cooking does not harden or contribute to an "overdone" taste. 

Left-overs, small entrees, salads, serve most attractively en casserole or en 
ramekin. 

The oven, for casserole cooking, should be kept about 1 1 2 degrees Fahren- 
heit, or less ; the food should simmer, not boil. 



ADVANTAGES OF CASSEROLE COOKING 

1 . The casseroles are clean, to start with. 

2. They are easy to keep clean, 

3. Their glaze is hard and acid-resisting. 

4. They are free from all injurious substances. 

5. They do not change flavor or affect color of food. 

6. They do not become flavored by food cooked in them. 

7. They cook gently, steadily and economically, both as regards shrinkage of food 
and consumption of fuel. 

8. They preserve all the goodness and the juice. 

9. They improve the appearance of food and intensify natural flavors. 

1 0. The casserole may be used either on top of the stove or in the oven. 

1 1 . The ingredients may be put into the casserole and allowed to stand in it for 
hours before cooking, without spoiling. 

12. Food may be served in the casserole, thereby insuring its reaching the table 
"piping hot." 

GLASSWARE BAKING DISHES 

The new glass dishes which have come into favor for baking are deservedly popular. 

They will resist any degree of oven temperature, are absolutely sanitary and easily 
cleaned, are not so cumbersome as earthenware and pottery casseroles, and are the last word 
in daintiness and attractiveness for table service. The process of special manufacture is such 
that the glass is almost unbreakable. 

With these glass dishes one can also see if the cake, for illustration, is done all the 
way through, instead of depending altogether on a testing straw. And dough does not stick 
to the side as with metal cake dishes. 

Glass is an unusually excellent retainer of heat, hence these glass dishes are eco- 
nomical, in that the heat may be turned off before the food is "done" and it will finish

"cooking" itself. Somewhat as in the case of "a fireless cooker," the retention of the heat 
makes all the difference in the world, too, when the food reaches the table piping hot instead 
of lukewarm. 

The prices of these dishes are about on a par with aluminum; a little more, as yet, 
than the crockery dishes. But it must be borne in mind that they are themselves decorative 
and do not need some form of decorative holders for serving. 

THE USE OF THE OVEN 

Most American housewives appreciate too poorly the old-fashioned art of cooking 
in the oven. They turn too readily to frying and broiling. 

"En Casserole" is incomparable for making chicken and other tender meats "go far," 
and is delicious for fish and game, and for vegetables and many other foods. And the oven 
must not be disregarded. 

For oven cooking, earthenware can be had in very many convenient forms. These 
vessels are apt to crack when new, but this can be avoided if they are toughened when bought 
by plunging into cold water, which is brought to a boil and kept boiling for five minutes. The 
well-known Boston bean pot is useful for many purposes, and the blue and white stew pot. 
The new cooking glass is attractive, durable, easily cleaned and cooks very rapidly. 

As food should so far as possible be served in the dish in which it is cooked — which 
also saves dish- washing — the little ramekin is a wonder; with ingenuity all sorts of dishes of 
which in the ordinary form one may grow tired may be shaped up attractively for individual 
service in the ramekin, garnished and seasoned as a "novelty." 

Do not rebel over the "long time" that is frequently necessary for oven cooking. 
The result justifies the care; besides, in most cases, little or no attention is required — one 
may pursue other duties in the interim, and casserole cooking may often be prepared the day 
before. 

With very little thought you can have many "oven meals" — nearly all of the foods 
being cooked in the oven at the same tinnie.

SAVE FUEL WHEN YOU COOK 

United States Food Leaflet No. 1 2 

Whatever fuel you use, make it go as far as possible. Money saved on fuel can 
well be spent on better foods to cook, and if you cut down your use of fuel, you can help 
make the supply go around. 

To have a fire you must have, besides fuel, air to make it burn. In gas and oil 
stoves the air supply is regulated by the makers. In coal or wood ranges or cook stoves 
you must regulate it by means of dampers. 

LEARN TO USE EVERY DAMPER IN YOUR KITCHEN RANGE 

The important dampers are: 

i . Damper in the ash pit which lets in the air which passes through the fuel box, 
making the fire burn. 

2. Damper over the fire controlling air to flow in above the fire. 

3. Oven damper which switches the current of hot air around the oven instead of 
letting it go by the shorter path up the stovepipe. 

4. Check draft damper in the stovepipe just above the range. This is not always 
found and is less important than the rest. 

5. Stove pipe damper which checks heat from escaping up the chimney. 

Make Your Fire the Right Way — ^To make a fire in a range, whether coal or wood, 
close all dampers of the stove and shake the firebox to free it from ashes, dust, and clinkers. 
Take off the lids over the fire-box, place crumpled paper in the fire-box, arrange kindlings 
over and around it so that air can pass freely between them, and put on a small shovelful 
of coal. Light the paper, open dampers Nos. I, 3, and 5, and put on lids. When the coal 
glows red, a little more coal should be added, and when the fire is burning well, the fire-box 
may be filled. If wood is used as fuel, put on a few sticks at a time. 

Learn to Manage the Fire — By the proper use of the dampers the fire can be con- 
trolled and the heat regulated. 

No. 1 . The damper in the ash pit. This should always be kept open when the 
fire is burning as it is the best source of air for the fire. Close it only when you dump the 
grate and when the fire is banked to keep it for some time. However, if there is no stove- 
pipe damper, the damper in the ash pit must be closed to check the draft when the fire 
burns too hard. 

No. 2. The damper over the fire. Close this when you are starting a fire. If the 
fire bums too rapidly so that the flames are long enough to reach the back row of lids, open 
the damper a little bit. This will shorten the length of the flame and give you more heat. 
If you open this too much it may cool the oven. 

No. 3. The oven damper. When this damper is closed the flames and smoke and 
hot air are forced to pass around the oven to heat it and then afterwards they escape up 
the chimney. When the damper is open they pass directly up the chimney. As soon as 
the fire is burning well, close this damper so that the oven will be heated. This will keep 
the oven so that you can make it very hot quickly by adding extra fuel and will warm your 
room if the oven door is left open. With this damper closed you w^ill use much less fuel 
than by allow^ing the heated air to take the shorter path up the chimney. 

No. 4. The Check draft damper in the stovepipe. It should be kept closed except 
when the fire is banked. 

No. 5. The stovepipe damper. This is a most important damper. It can control 
the amount of fuel burned, as the more slowly the hot air passes up the pipe the more 
slowly the fire burns. A great deal of the fuel sometimes merely furnishes heat that escapes

up the chimney. Check this escape of heat and burn less fuel by using the pipe clamper. 
If your fire is burning too hard, instead of closing the damper in the ash pit, close the one 
in the pipe, for it checks the fire much more effectively than the oter damper. 

If your oven does not heat even with the oven damper closed, it is probably be- 
cause the air carried around the oven has been pulled through the fire so fast that it has 
not been thoroughly heated itself and can not heat the oven. Close the pipe damper. 

Keep Your Range Cleaned Out — If the fire-box is clogged with ashes, air can not 
pass through the fuel to make it burn. If soot hangs on the stove lids, less heat can come 
through it. A layer of ashes over the top and under the oven keeps it from heating quickly. 

Banking the Fire — It is an economy to keep a hard-coal fire over from day to day. 
especially if the range is used as a source of heat for the room. As a rule a wood fire is 
hard to keep over but the hard-coal fire can be easily kept. In the evening rake out the 
ashes, put coal on, and open the dampers until the fresh fuel is burning well. Put on coal 
until the fire-box is almost full and close all the dampers except the check draft damper in 
the stovepipe. 

Think of the Fire When You Select the Food to Cook — If you keep a slow fire in 
your range all day to supply heat for the room, select foods that require long, slow cooking. 
Baked beans or peas, roasts, and puddings can be baked in the oven and cereals cooked in a 
double boiler on the back of the stove. Avoid foods that require a very hot fire for a long 
time. 

Gas, Kerosene or Coal Oil, and Gasoline are economical for cooking if carefully 
used. Never mix two liquid fuels and never use gasoline in an oil stove, for each requires 
a special burner. Use all with care. 

WAYS TO SAVE GAS AND OIL 

Reduce the Number of Burners Used — You can cook more than one kind of food 
over the same burner. If you have a colander or a wire basket that fits over an ordinary 
kettle, you can steam such vegetables as carrots or squash in the colander at the same 
time that you boil potatoes in the kettle. The under part of the double boiler can be used 
to boil eggs or small vegetables, while cereal cooks in the upper part. Compartment ves- 
sels that have two or three separate divisions fitting together over one burner may be pur- 
chased. 

Regulate the Size of the Flame — Turn the flame down after the boiling point is 
reached, for water that is boiling fast is no hotter than water that is boiling slowly. When 
the flame spreads up around the vessel you are wasting fuel. 

Don't Be Afraid of Relighting the Gas — Turn it out when you remove the vessel 
from the burner. Matches are cheaper than gas. 

Have a Regular Bsdce Day — If you bake bread, bake as much at one time as will 
be eaten before it dries out. 

Don't Light the Oven to Bsdce a Single Dbh — If you have a roast for dinner that re- 
quires the use of the oven, plan a baked dinner. Beef roast with brown potatoes, scalloped 
tomatoes, and Apple Betty all could be baked at one time. Or, if you light the oven to bake 
quick breads or cake, bake fruit or a dessert for another meal. Small ovens that fit over 
one burner save fuel. 

Select foods that can be quickly cooked. Cook in larger quantities such foods as 
cereals and soups that require long cooking. They will keep in the refrigerator and you will 
save much fuel. Leaflet No. I 3 tells how to make a fireless cooker at home and how to 
use it to cut down your use of fuel. No matter what kind of fuel you use, the fireless 
cooker can help you save it. 



THE FIRELESS COOKER 

There is nothing new under the sun, and the fireless cooker, which has of 
recent years come into much usage, was known to the ancients. The Chinese and 
the Crusaders knew and practiced its principle, and the "clam-bake" of the East and 
"barbecue" of the West are only special forms in w^hich the principle is used. 

Fireless cooking does not mean cooking without fire. The cooker does not 
supply its own heat. One does not accuse a refrigerator of attempting to furnish 
its own ice. The cooker merely uses stored heat, as the refrigerator does stored 
cold. It is only that the fireless cooker retains the heat that goes into it, and gives it 
off to the cooking process later. It is economical because this surplus heat is stored 
and not lost, as is the case if the same foods are left to simmer over a fire. 

There are many advantages in the fireless cooker. There are no burned hands and 
no spoiled food if the meal is kept waiting. The utensils last a long time and are easily 
cleaned each time used — there are no blackened pans to be scrubbed. There is no unpleas- 
ant odor over the house from the cooking, and cheap cuts of meat may be used because they 
can be cooked long and slowly to soften their toughness. 

In fireless cooking the heat needed is only enough to bring the food up to the cooking 
temperature. The cooker then retains this heat, and the food continues to cook slowly until 
done, or ready to serve. It is not intense heat that cooks properly, but even heat slowly and 
steadily supplied. 

The cooker saves hours of time. Once in the cooker the food can be practically 
forgotten while one goes about other household duties. One can go shopping while the 
dinner is "cooking itself." Cereals for breakfast may be cooked over night. 

The fireless cooker may be used as an "iceless" freezer. It is simply a reversal of 
principle. Excellent mousses, custards and other desserts may be made in a cooker, with the 
application of a little cracked ice in the bottom, to give off its refrigeration later, instead of 
heat to give its cooking quality in the usual manner. 

As in any other branch of cookery, one will usually fail to get the best results at first 
in a fireless cooker. It has to be studied, and practiced a bit on the different foods until 
one gets them "just right." But one does not quit on biscuit because they do not turn out 
as expected the first time tried. Apply the same common sense to a fireless cooker; get a 
good one and keep at it for a week or so until you learn its personality, and you will not 
thereafter be without it. 

You do not need special recipes for the fireless cooker. Take any food that you 
have used on your cook stove, put it in the fireless cooker, and it will turn out better. 
Vegetables and cereals that need long cooking are of far finer flavor when cooked by this 
method. 

A food to be boiled must actually boil for five minutes before being set in the cooker; 
it must be at the boiling point all the way through. Do not try to cook too small a quantity 
of anything by this method. A small quantity does not retain the heat. 

But most especially remember it is not a matter of an intricate art or special recipes 
but rather that you get the habit of putting your foods in the filess cooker as a matter of course 
instead of on or in the stove, and your work and time will be cut in two and your food will be 
of finer flavor and more wholesome in every way.

LET THE 

FIRELESS COOKER 

HELP YOU COOK 

United States Food Leaflet No. 13 

You can't afford to be without one. The fireless cooker can save fuel in winter and 
make your kitchen comfortable in summer. It will save you time and labor for you can 
have your dinner cooking while you attend to other duties or go away from home. Make 
one for yourself. It may cost less than a dollar and will pay for itself in time and fuel saved. 
Or buy a ready-made one. 

How a Fireless Cooker Cooks — First the food is made as hot as it can be on the 
stove, then it is put immediately into the cooker. Once there, it stays hot and keeps on 
cooking. The walls of the fireless cooker keep the heat in just as the walls of a good 
refrigerator keep the heat out. 

MATERL\LS NEEDED FOR A FIRELESS COOKER 

1 . The Outside Container — Any good-sized box or bucket with a tight cover — a 
grocery box, a butter firkin, a wooden candy bucket, a I 00 pound lard can, or a new gar- 
bage can. 

2. Packing Material — Soft hay excelsior, ground cork, sawdust, tightly crumpled 
newspaper, or any other good non-conducting material that can be packed in closely. This 
packing material forms a nest for the cooking vessel. 

3. The nest Lining — A metal or enamel bucket and sheet asbestos to cover the 
bucket. The bucket must have straight sides and a lid and must be of such a size as to 
allow at least three inches of packing material between it and the outside container, top, 
bottom, and sides. 

4. The Cooking Vessel — A vessel with a tight lid to fit closely into the nest lining 
and yet slip in and out easily, or two or three of the small ones especially made for the fire- 
less. The best kind is of enamel, granite or aluminum. 

5. Cardboard — To make the collar. 

6. The Cushion — Denim or muslin stuffed with the packing material. This cushion 
is to be pressed down across the top under the outside lid. 

7. Two Soapstone Disks — Purchasable at a hardware store. They are not needed 
for all cooking, but with them you can cookmore quickly and in greater variety. 

TO MAKE THE FIRELESS COOKER 

1 . Line the outside container with newspaper if a wooden box is used. 

2. Pack the bottom of the outside container compactly with a layer of the packing 
material to the depth of three inches or more. 

3. Cut a circle of asbestos two inches larger in diameter than the nest lining. Place 
the asbestos mat in the center of the packing. 

4. Cut a strip of asbestos big enough to cover completely the outside walls of the 
bucket which is to serve as the nest lining, and tie it in place. 

5. Place the bucket with its asbestos covering directly in the center on the asbestos 
mat. Hold in place and tightly fill in the space between it and the walls of the outside 
container with the packing material. Pack in solidly to within one-half inch of the top of 
the bucket. The success of your cooker depends largely upon the tightness with which 
you crowd in the packing material, which prevents the heat from escaping from your hot 
food. 



82 



THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Section IV— Part 1— TALKS ON FOOD 



6. Cut a piece of cardboard to Bt in the outside container. Cut a hole in the middle 
of it which will fit closely over the bucket which forms the nest lining. This "collar" holds 
the packing material in place. 

7. Make the cushion for the top by cutting two pieces of cloth the size of the out- 
side container and putting them together with a straight strip of cloth three inches wide. 
Stuff with the packing material. 

8. Outside finishings. If a box is used for the outside container, the lid should be 
hinged and fastened down with a hook. If it is of wood, paint or stain it a dark color. 
Casters make it convenient to move about.

SOME PRECAUTIONS IN USING THE FIRELESS 

Don't let the food or disks cool before you put them in the fireless. The food will 
not cook unless there is enough heat shut up with it. Reheat the food that requires long 
cooking, if it cools before it is finished. Reheat the food before serving, if necessary. A 
small quantity of food cools quickly, so either use the disks or put a small vessel containing 
the food in the regular cooking vessel and surround it with hot water. 

Soapstone disks will increase the usefulness of your cooker. They can be heated 
hotter than the boiling point of water, and when shut up in the fireless furnish heat which 
cooks the food. If you made your fireless according to directions, you can safely use the 
disks. Heat them very hot, but do not let them get red hot for fear of cracking. With one 
below and one on top of the cooking vessel you will be able to roast meat or even to bake 
bread or puddings. Without the disks your fireless is useful only for certain kinds of food 
— cereals, beans, pot roasts, stews, etc. — things that can be cooked in water.

SOME FIRELESS SPECIALTIES 



CEREALS 

Prepare as for the stove, but use one-sixth less 
>vater. Boil for I minutes, or longer with coarser 
cereals. Place in the cooker boiling hot and leave 
6 or 8 hours or over night. 

MEATS 
Buy cheaper cuts. The fireless can make tough 
meat tender. For more recipes see Leaflet No. 5. 

CREOLE STEW 

One pound lean beef or I medium fowl, 2 cups 
tomatoes, I cup carrots or okra cut small, I cup 
chopped sweet peppers, ]/i cup rice, Ya c"P 
chopped onion, I teaspoon salt, I tablespoon fat. 

Cut the meat in small pieces or cut the fowl 
into joints. Melt the fat, add the onions, peppers, 
meat or chicken. Brown for « 'ew minutes. Put 
in cooking vessel with seasoning, rice, vegetables, 
and one cup boiling water. Simmer for |/2 hour 
and put in fireless for 3 hours without the disks 



or 2 hours with them. With chicken and okra this 
is the famous Creole chicken of the South. 

ROASTS 

Sear the roast, season, place in the cooking 
vessel between two hot disks. Do not add water. 
Allow 25 minutes per pound. 

SOUP STOCK 

Cut up meat, crack bones, and cover with cold 
water. Let it reach the boiling point, then place 
in cooker for several hours. 

DRIED FRUITS AND VEGETABLES 
Peas, beans, corn, dried fruit — soak in water 
until restored to the original size. Boil a few min- 
utes, then keep in the cooker 6 to 1 2 hours. Baked 
beans or peas are especially good cooked in the 
fireless. See Leaflet No. 1 4.

Agriculture for Farmers' Bulletin 771, "Home- 
made Fireless Cookers and Their Use." 



FORM THE OLIVE OIL HABIT 

The medicinal value of fats is very great. Olive oil is one of the best of 
foods. It is a laxative and body builder. We are apt to forget that, like both the 
front gate and the sewing machine, the human system needs a lubricant, and for this 
there is nothing better than olive oil. 

The best varieties of olive oil come to us from Italy and France. Spain also 
produces a clear, excellent oil ; but for the American taste the Spanish oil is a little 
too strongly flavored. Indeed, we might take a valuable lesson from the Italian and 
French peasants who use olive oil almost to the exclusion of other fats, and cer- 
tainly the women of these peoples are thrifty housewives, fully aware of the eco- 
nomic excellence of the oil. When the cost of olive oil, as against that of other 
fats, is not too great for the family purse, it should be used liberally. 

Olive Oil for Cooking — With the growing demand for olive oil unfortunately the 
adulterater has put out oil that is not absolutely pure; and although Uncle Sam has almost 
stopped the adulteration with seed oils the careful housewife will find that there is only one 
safe way to avoid being imposed on with mixtures of inferior foreign oils, and that is to find 
a standard, reliable brand and refuse any substitute. 

Form the Habit — TTie cost of the best oil is normally in the vicinity of $1 .00 a quart, 
and although this may seem to many housewives to put it in the class of luxuries, they must 
stop and think of the varied uses and the nutritive value of good oil. 

Form the habit of keeping a quart can of oil in the refrigerator, then use it as plenti- 
fully as the purse will permit; the results in the improved cooking and family health will con- 
vince the most skeptical of its merits as a family necessity. 

Tin has now almost replaced glass as a container for olive oil, and not only because 
tin is cheaper, lighter and more convenient, but also because a strong light deteriorates olive 
oil. Keep the can of oil in an even temperature and after it is opened in a cool temperature; 
and as it is quick to absorb other odors keep it corked or tightly closed. 

To make olive oil recipes the success they should be, the following must be observed : 
Buy quart cans. Buy a known and reliable brand, and once you are suited accept no substi- 
tute and don't look for "bargains" — they will result in dissatisfaction. 

Almost everything to be fried is improved by being cooked in olive oil. Apples, 
eggs, omelets, and even steaks or cutlets are delicious when cooked in this way, while a steak 
whose tenderness is in doubt will be rendered excellent if it is saturated in a mixture of 
olive oil and a tablespoonful of lemon juice. 

Fritter batters, corn, oysters, etc., will prove a revelation if oil is used for the shorten- 
ing, as they will be lighter, far more delicate and consequently easier of digestion. 

Certain other vegetable oils are very good and, except for flavor, very nearly as 
desirable as olive oil. It is not intended here to recommend the exclusive use of olive oil 
over these others, which are in most cases absolutely pure and wholesome. But the use of 
olive oil is not ordinarily appreciated to the extent it should be, and the housewife should by 
all means "form the habit" of using it as freely as she can.

CARE OF UTENSILS AND GENERAL CONVENIENCES 

There are two maxims which the housewife should have in mind w^hen she 
enters her kitchen workshop. They are: "Plan your work and work your plan," 
and "A place for everything and everything in its place." 

A few simple articles kept handy and a little judgment used in the arrange- 
ment of shelves, tables and hooks, w^ill do wonders tow^ards lessening labor and 
saving steps. 

The old saying that it is as cheap to sit as to stand should be observed in 
the kitchen of all places. A revolving stool, or any kind of high chair or seat, 
will prove a boon to the kitchen worker. It is not a sign of laziness but of con- 
servation to sit while you work. 

Have tables and chairs and shelves arranged to suit your height; stooping 
and bending tire unnecessarily. 

Above all things, learn to think. In making trips to the pantry, ice box or 
cellar, take things to be left there, and bring others on the same trip. Heed the 
old saying, "Make your head save your heels." 



TABLE AND KITCHEN UTENSILS 

(From "Selection of Household Equipment" — Yearbook, Department of Agriculture) 

Table and kitchen utensils make up an important group of furnishings. Very 
often the same kind of articles in different qualities are found in both sets. Table plates 
differ from kitchen plates more in their unattractiveness than in any other way. Real china 
or porcelain, which is always translucent and of which the choice tablewares are usually 
made, is more suitable for occasional than general use because it is rather fragile, but its light 
weight, fine color and smooth surface are undeniably beautiful. Earthenware with a good 
glaze usually ranks next to porcelain and is very satisfactory for general use. The old blue 
and w^hite Staffordshire wares, which were so highly prized in colonial days in this country, 
belonged to this type, and similar ware is still to be obtained in many satisfactory designs, 

93 



94 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Sec. IV— Pt. 2— COOKING AND RECIPES 

one of the common ones being the well known willow pattern. Large and conspicuous 
designs usually become tiresome on things which are used as frequently as table dishes and 
it is safer to select plain white or some all-over pattern or inconspicuous bands of flowers, 
color or gilt. It is usually wiser to buy tableware from an open-stock design than to take 
the regular sets, which often include unnecessary pieces and cannot always be replaced 
when broken. Good, plain shapes are ordinarily to be preferred to more fancy ones, 
because they are better adapted to their purposes and are easier to clean than those which 
have irregular surfaces which catch and hold the dust. Pitchers, teapots and other dishes 
with openings so small that the hand cannot be inserted to wash and wipe them are to 
be avoided, or a teapot which is hard to clean on account of an elaborate handle. Kitchen 
crockery, like tableware, should have a good, smooth- finished glaze which will clean easily 
and not chip. 

Glassware is to be obtained in almost any grade, from the most expensive cut- 
glass to the coarse kind used in jelly tumblers. The choice depends on the pocketbook, 
but it should not be forgotten that plain glass or glass cut in a simple pattern is easier to 
keep shining and is usually more beautiful thcin any except possibly the very expensive 
types of elaborately ornamented glass. 

Knives, forks and spoons are made in several kinds of metal. Silver is the most 
durable and always has an intrinsic value. Plated silver is made so well and so cheaply 
nowadays that almost every family can have at least a supply of forks and spoons. Many 
prefer steel-bladed to silver knives for the main course at a meal because they cut better, 
but they are harder to care for than silver or plated ones. Tea sets, pitchers and other 
serving dishes come in good designs in plated as well as solid silver. If the family hap- 
pens to own handsome ones, they make appropriate sideboard ornaments; but they require 
frequent rubbing up to keep them bright, emd unless they are needed every day on the 
table it is better to put them away and reserve them for special occasions than to let 
them stand about tarnished. 

There is much discussion as to the best material for cooking utensils. The truth 
is that no material is best for all, and the work is most easily and satisfactorily done if 
different kinds are chosen for different needs. Earthenware is excellent for certain pur- 
poses, as it holds the heat evenly, and baking dishes or casseroles in which the food can 
be served as well as cooked save dishwashing. Such wares are not adapted to all kinds 
of cooking, however. The great heat of fat in frying, for example, especially when the 
hot fat spatters up against the cooler parts of the dish, is likely to crack it. Enameled 
ware is light in weight, easy to clean, and is little affected by acids; it is excellent for 
mixing dishes and for keeping food in, but the cheaper grades do not always stand the 
heat of cooking well and soon chip. The enamel should be free from bubbles and have 
smooth, evenly finished edges which will not chip readily. Aluminum heats quickly and so 
economizes fuel, comes in very good shapes, is light to handle and very durable; it is 
affected by alkalis, discolors easily and is rather hard to clean. Nevertheless, since it does 
not rust, it is especially desirable for teakettles, double boilers, kettle covers, etc. Cast 
iron is still common ware for kitchen utensils, but it is being replaced in many homes by 
materials which are lighter in weight and less expensive. Good iron pans and skillets are 
excellent for some kinds of cooking, however, because they heat more evenly than those 
of other materials, and they last for generations. Iron rusts easily and is affected by acids 
as aluminum is by alkalis. It is because of the action of acids that iron dishes sometimes 
injure the color and flavor of food, and for this reason food, especially acid food, is 
usually not allowed to stand in them. Tin and sheet iron plated with tin are in common 
use in most kitchens because they are rather inexpensive, but they are not entirely satisfac- 
tory. Unless they are unusually heavy, they lose their shape quickly, and in thinly plated 
kinds the tin wears off and the iron beneath rusts easily. 



KITCHEN HELPS— UTENSILS. CHOICE AND CARE 95 

The shape of kettles has much to do with the quickness with which their contents 
heat. The smaller the surface which comes in contact with the heat, the longer it will take 
the contents to become warm, and vice versa. This means that in a kettle with a broad 
base the contents heat more quickly than in one with a small base. The point should 
especially be considered where gas stoves are employed and fuel must be carefully used. 

Because a thing is to be used in the kitchen is no reason why it should be ugly 
to look at, and if the housekeeper can find mixing bowls and kettles which are attractive 
in shape, color and finish, as well as convenient and easy to clean, they will give her a 
sense of pleasure every time they are used. 



CHOICE AND CARE OF UTENSILS 

(Extracts from Bulletin under above title, being Farm House Series No. 5, 
Cornell Reading Course Lessons for the Farm Home) 

POINTS TO BE CONSIDERED IN CHOICE OF UTENSILS 

In order to choose a utensil deserving of its name, something fit for use, we must 
consider the following points: 

Is the utensil genuine, "as advertised"? No other investment of money is so 
bitterly regretted as one that calls for the admission, "This was not worth buying at any 
price." 

Is the utensil durable? A purchase of permanent equipment should add enough 
to the value of the working plant so that it need not be charged as an expense against the 
year of its purchase, but may be treated as an investment covering as many years as its 
usefulness continues. 

Is the utensil convenient to handle? This depends on more than mere lack of 
weight. A heavy utensil, well balanced, with handle or bail set in just the right place 
and way, may be easier to use than a lighter one in which these points were not con- 
sidered and which must be kept balanced by hand and w^rist in order not to tip. 

For a utensil of moderate size, easily lifted with one hand, occupying little space 
in itself and intended for use on top of the stove only, a fairly long handle is best; it does 
not get in the way of the cover or contents to be poured out, and may be so constructed 
as not to grow uncomfortably hot to the hand. 

It is convenient, at times, to have a utensil that may be transferred at will from 
the top of the stove to the oven. For this purpose utensils are made with a very short 
handle or with two handles of the sugar-bowl type. 

The half-circle metal bail is best reserved for vessels so large in themselves as to 
require much stove and storage space and needing two hands to lift them. 

What kind of cover shall we choose? For long, slow cooking, when the purpose 
is to conserve heat, moisture and flavor, a tight fitting cover is necessary. For rapid boil- 
ing, where much steam is being produced, an easily removed cover is an essential safe- 
guard. 

Is the lip of the utensil in the right place? Lips of utensils should be on the side 
that is convenient, according as we are right or left-handed. How many fulfill this re- 
quirement? Those with lip on each side are plainly sensible. Most utensils are designed 
to be held in the right hand while pouring one liquid into another. This necessitates either 
stirring with the left hand — a difficult operation — or alternately pouring and stirring with 
the right hand. 

Is the utensil easy to clean? In order to insure ease of cleaning, a utensil should 
be made of one piece of metal with rounded edges or sides, not with seams or corners. 



96 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Sec. IV— Pt. 2— COOKING AND RECIPES 

It should not have a rolled rim with a rough edge underneath. The joining of utensil 
and handle should not offer grooves or tunnels as gathering places for particles of grease, 
dust and soap. It is imperatively important that the inside rather than the outside of the 
utensil be smooth, polished and consequently easy to clean. The opening should be wide 
enough to permit easy access to every part of the utensil. 

Is the utensil of proper size and shape for the amount and kind of cooking to be 
done? The pan that makes an ideal omelet for three would produce a very unevenly 
cooked dish if used for an omelet for six. The breakfast cereal for a small family, if put 
into a large ketrie in the fireless cooker, would soon lose its small stock of heat and 
remain raw. 

If a gas or an oil stove is used, the size of the bottom of the utensil greatly affects 
economy of fuel, time of cooking, and quality of the finished product. If utensils fail to fit 
the burner, a thin stove-lid of the proper size may be placed over the flame. 

The time needed for evaporation, or boiling down, depends on the amount of sur- 
face exposed; hence evaporation will go on more rapidly in a utensil that flares at the tip 
than in one whose top and bottom are of the same size. The contents of a utensil made 
of material that is a good conductor of heat, such as aluminum, will boil down more rapidly 
than if put into an agateware utensil of the same size. 

Is the utensil safe as a food receptacle? There must be no risk of forming poison- 
ous compounds. As an illustration: we avoid the use of an iron utensil in canning and 
preserving, because we know that iron and fruit acids together form a compound which, 
although not actually harmful — iron being needed often in the blood — is of little value when 
taken in this form, and is at least a discoloring agent for the food and therefore detracting 
from the appetizing appearance. And this caution should go a step farther. If an enamel 
kettle has become chipped, so that the iron foundation and the acid can combine, it is best 
not to use it for cooking acid foods; even if the danger to health is slight, there remains 
the possible economic loss through impaired flavor or through scorching, as well as the chance 
that chips of enamel may find their way into the food. 

UTENSILS BEST ADAPTED TO THE DIFFERENT PROCESSES 
OF COOKING 

BAKING — Cake — Tin, if well cared for, is the metal best adapted for cake making. 
The round tin with a tube in the centre, known as an angel-cake tin, produces the most level 
and evenly baked cake, owing to the fact that the heat reaches the center of the cake as 
soon as any other part. A plain round tin, not too deep, gives the next best result; a square 
tin is next, while an oblong tin requires very careful regulation of heat in order to produce a 
well-baked cake. 

Bread — The choice of utensils for bread baking lies between tin and Russia-iron (a 
sheet iron treated by a process having a polished blue-black surface). Since bread requires 
a hotter oven than does cake, the Russia-iron pan should have first choice; it absorbs more 
heat than does tin, is less affected by high temperature and is more durable. 

Pie — It has been found that the best results are obtained from the use of granite- 
ware plates, that old tin plates are next in order, while perforated and wire plates come 
third. 

Cookies — Cookies are best baked on Russia-iron sheets cut to fit the oven, with 
heavy tin sheets as second choice. 

MEIATS— Roasting — Roasts require a high temperature at the start in order to sear 
the surface; for this reason the best choice is a pan of iron or high-grade granite ware. 
An oval pan can be more carefully cleaned than one with sharp corners. 



KITCHEN HELPS— UTENSILS. CHOICE AND CARE 97 

Pot Roasts — The iron kettle with a tight-fitting cover, called also the "Dutch 
oven," best supplies the steady heat that a pot roast needs. Although a casserole may be 
used, or a bean pot with waxed paper tied tightly over the top, in either of these there is 
more evaporation than in the iron kettle, and the roast is therefore drier, although just as 
tender. 

Meat Stews — Since in stews more liquid is added than in pot roasts, the casserole 
may well be used, or a shallow aluminum or granite-ware stewpan with close-fitting cover, 
straight sides, and very short or loop-shaped handles. The long, slow cooking may thus 
be done either in the oven or on top of the stove. In brown stews, the meat is first sauteed 
in an iron pan in order to give the desired color and flavor. 

Stewing Fruits or Vegetables — Aluminum, granite, or enamel ware is equally good 
for this purpose. A wide, shallow type of saucepan, with well-fitting cover, should be 
selected for fruits and for such vegetables as require to be cooked in a small amount of 
water; while a deep saucepan, without a cover, is best for the cooking of strong-juiced 
vegetables that need a large amount of water. 

Sauteing — A rather heavy iron or steel frying-pan is best adapted for this pur- 
pose. In a thin pan, or in one of granite-ware, the fat passes too soon from the tempera- 
ture at which it forms the desired golden-brown crust on the food to be cooked to the 
point where it begins to decompose and become irritating to the mucous membranes. 

Frying — For frying in deep fat use an iron or steel frying kettle, which may either 
be bowl-shaped or have straight sides. The latter shape accommodates a greater number 
of articles at a time, and is more convenient for use with a wire frying basket, since the 
basket fits it more readily. In using the bowl-shaped kettle, a long handled skimmer 
may be found more convenient for removing the food. The kettle should be deep enough 
so that when it is two-thirds full of fat the food to be cooked will be entirely immersed. 

Candy-Making — Professional confectioners use a copper kettle. For the home candy- 
maker, aluminum comes nearest to copper in its quality of conducting heat. Syrup boiled 
in an aluminum kettle rarely scorches, and the smooth surface makes it easy to keep the 
sides wiped free from sugar crystals as they form. 

Jelly-Making — Enamel or granite-ware (unless there is a defect in the enamel 
finish) is the best selection for jelly-making, because of the ease with w^hich it may be 
cleaned and the certainty that it will neither affect nor be affected by the acid of fruit 
juices. 

CHOICE OF VARIOUS UTENSIUS 

Knives — The assortment of knives should include a bread knife, butcher's knife, a 
knife vfith waved edge for cutting fresh bread and cake, and a palette knife, used by 
artists in cleaning palettes and adopted in every kitchen where cooking is classed among 
the fine arts, as by means of it a bowl may be so completely freed from the batter that 
was mixed in it as to reduce dish-washing to a minimum, while increasing the quantity 
of cake obtained to a maximum. 

Heating Knives — To preserve the temper of steel knives, we must avoid the practice 
of heating the blade on top of the stove to facilitate cutting fresh bread or cake. Allow- 
ing hot water to run over the blade accomplishes the same purpose without injury to the 
knife, and this should always be done in cutting a frosted cake, in order not to mar the 
frosting. 

Egg Beaters — Different types of egg beaters are needed, according to the con- 
sistency desired in the beaten whites. For all-round use, the Dover egg beater is a good 



98 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Sec. IV— Pt. 2— COOKING AND RECIPES 

choice, because it works most quickly. The balloon-shaped egg whisk made of piano wire 
carries more air into the mixture, and the flat wire beater gives the airiest texture of all. 
Either of the latter types is preferable to the Dover egg beater for angel-cake, sponge 
cake or meringues. 

Spoons — Spoons of hard wood should be used whenever possible; they are lighter 
than metal ones, do not discolor the hand, make less noise, do not get hot to the hand, 
and do not scratch metal surfaces. For basting roasts, or whenever a specially strong 
spoon is needed, a tinned iron spoon is good. Enamel spoons are not practical, as they 
are likely to bend and crack the enamel. 

Pewtry and Vegetable Brushes — If brushes are used in connection with food — that 
is, for greasing pans or for brushing rolls or pastry with butter, eggs or milk — they must 
be of a kind that can be cleansed with boiling water. This is impossible if the bristles 
are glued in. The bristles should be strong and pliable and should be bound to the handle 
with twine rather than metal. Small wooden-backed brushes are indispensable for the 
proper cleaning of vegetables, for brushing grated lemon rind from the grater, and for 
many other purposes. A round pitcher- or bottle-brush, and a long wire-handled trap 
brush for the refrigerator, are sanitary necessities. 

PREPARING NEW UTENSILS FOR USE 

Iron, Tin and Elnamel Ware — It is a general custom to prepare a new iron utensil 
for use, after thorough cleansing, by rubbing unsalted fat over it and baking the fat in. The 
same treatment is adapted to tin, for while it destroys its shiny new appearance, it protects 
the tin from rust and increases its capacity for holding heat. Enamel ware, too, is said to 
be protected from cracking and chipping if it is well rubbed with fat before being used for 
the first time; the fat, however, cannot be baked in as with tin and iron, since it would not 
be absorbed, but only burned fast to the glaze. 

Glass — Tumblers, jars and lamp chimneys may be toughened by putting them into a 
kettle of cold water, bringing it gradually to the boil, and after boiling a few minutes allow- 
ing it to gradually cool again. ' 

Machinery — Egg beaters, ice cream freezers, and any other utensil in which there is 
friction between two parts, should be carefully oiled before using, the wheels turned until 
the oil has reached every part, and all surplus oil wiped off before the utensil is used for 
food. The bearings should never be put in water, since they cannot be perfectly dried and 
therefore would become roughened and clogged by rust. 

PROLONGING THE USEFULNESS OF UTENSILS 

Repair Kit — A well stocked repair kit is a necessary part of the up-to-date kitchen, 
in fact it applies to the home generally. If we calculate the time, strength and nervous force 
wasted in trying to use a teakettle lid with a loose knob, as against the time that it would 
take to tighten the nut which holds that knob if only the screwdriver were close at hand; 
in hunting for the kitchen memorandum in a drawer when a nail and hammer would fasten 
it to the w^all; in tugging at a warped pantry door when a few strokes of the plane would 
make it open and close easily; in slamming a door that will not close in any other way, for 
the lack of a drop of oil on the catch; in having to discard a pet saucepan in the midst of 
preparing a company dinner because a tiny hole makes it useless, when a drop of solder 
would cure the trouble; in trying to carve meat or cut bread with a dull knife, when the pos- 
session of a knife sharpener and the knowledge of how to use it would make the process 
a pleasure: we shall readily see what a change would be wrought by the possession of a 



KITCHEN HELPS— UTENSILS, CHOICE AND CARE 99 

toolchest containing hammer, screwdriver, plane, pliers, oil can, saw, soldering outfit, knife 
sharpener, twine, shears, and such nails, tacks, screws and hooks as are most often in demand. 

PROTECTION OF UTENSILS NOT IN USE 

If the house is to be closed for a time, or if for any other reason the utensils are 
to be set aside, all metals should be protected from dampness by a coating of vaseline, 
paraffin, or unsalted fat of some kind. 

MATERIALS AND THEIR CARE. 

Iron and Steel — Of the metals used in our kitchens, iron in its three varieties — cast 
iron, wrought iron and steel — is most common. Besides the utensils commonly known as 
iron and steel, we have also those in which iron or steel form the foundation; tin, galvan- 
ized iron, enamel, and nickel-plated ware. 

A good iron or steel utensil, well cared for, grows better the longer it is used. 
The two essentials are that it be kept dry and that it be kept smooth. The chief foe of iron 
is rust, caused by the action of moist air. Rust in itself has no harmful effect on food, 
but by roughening the utensil it makes it insanitary. Moreover, rust once started pro- 
ceeds rapidly to eat into the utensil that it has attacked. 

Some cooks assert that an iron utensil should never be washed, but only thoroughly 
rubbed after use, in order that its surface may be protected by a constant coating of fat. 
However, if the air cannot attack the iron, it does attack the fat, causing decomposition 
which will taint the food cooked in such a utensil. The best way, therefore, to clean an iron 
utensil is to boil in it a solution of washing soda, rinse it with boiling water, and see that it 
is thoroughly dry before being put away. Iron that is put away for a time should be pro- 
tected with paraffin. 

Tin — The better grades of tin are not affected by the air, by weak acids such as 
vinegar or fruit juices, or by alkalis; they therefore effectually protect the steel foundation. 
Cheap grades, however, are not proof against the action of acids, and all grades are likely 
to change under the action of acids when hot. The quality of tin used may be determined 
by noting how a piece is marked, X being the cheapest and XXXX the best quality. 

Tin utensils must be carefully protected from scratches, since every scratch, by mar- 
ring the soft metal, exposes the steel foundation and is soon followed by a streak of rust. 
A tin utensil and a metal spoon should therefore never be used in combination, nor should 
a metal scraper be used for cleaning tin. Washing in hot soapsuds, boiling in a weak solu- 
tion of washing soda, rubbing with whiting or one of the prepared cleaning powders, are the 
best ways of caring for tin. 

A Pointer on Bread and Cake Boxes — Tin storage receptacles are good for keep- 
ing cookies and cake, but stone crocks are better for bread. The difference lies in the 
fact that the process of growing stale is a different one in each case. Cookies turn stale 
by absorbing moisture from outside; therefore they require that moisture be kept away. 
This the impervious tin cake-box does, especially if we add to the contents a few pieces 
of charcoal to absorb what little moisture may accumulate. Bread grows stale by a shift- 
ing of its ovm moisture from crumb to crust. A fresh loaf has a crisp crust and a soft 
crumb, while in a stale loaf the reverse is true. In a tin box, especially if it be unven- 
tilated, this moisture, held in the crust, soon makes a musty loaf. In a stone crock, which 
is porous, the moisture has a chance to escape, the crust becomes less soggy, and the 
flavor of the loaf is better maintained. In cake, where there is less difference in texture 
betwen the outside and the inside of the loaf, staleness consists in a gradual general loss 
of moisture. Cake is therefore better kept in tin, with the addition of a receptacle con- 



1 00 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Sec. IV— Pt. 2— COOKING AND RECIPES 

taining water, to be daily renewed. If cake and bread be stored in the same box, the 
cake will take up moisture (and incidentally a bready flavor) from the bread and remain 
moist longer, while the bread will dry faster than when stored by itself. 

Granite and Ejiamel Ware — Granite and enamel ware are made by coating sheet iron 
or steel utensils with an enamel or glaze. Two or three coats of enamel are applied suc- 
cessively. The quality of the enamel depends on the ingredients used and on the num- 
ber of coats applied. Durability of granite and enamel ware depends no less on the quality 
of the steel or iron foundation than on the enamel finish. Tlie foundation should be firm 
enough so that it will not bend or dent easily, since this inevitably cracks the enamel. 
The tendency to bend makes enamel spoons unpractical. 

"Seconds" — There is a mistaken belief that if we avoid so-called "seconds" we are 
sure of getting a good article. As a matter of fact, it is only conscientious manufacturers 
who test their wares and set aside as "seconds" pieces that are not perfect in color or shape, 
or that show in the bend of the utensil pinholes which the enamel failed to cover perfectly. 
If the perfect pieces, or "firsts," made by such a firm are beyond our purse, we are safer 
in buying their "seconds" thzui in choosing cheap "firsts" so-called. A poor quality of enamel 
soon wears off or loses its gloss and may even discolor and dissolve in the dishwater. 

Galvanized Iron — If iron, instead of being coated with tin or enamel, is dipped into 
melted zinc, it is known as galvanized iron. The zinc coating makes iron rust-proof, hence 
galvanized iron is the best material for garbage cans, refrigerator pans, and the like. Zinc 
is affected by the action of salt by the seashore, so that it does not last well, and it is not 
safe for use in cooking utensils because it is affected by both acids and alkalis. 

Nickel-Plated Ware — Another coating given to iron is melted nickel, the product 
being called nickel-plated ware. This takes on a high polish, does not rust and is easily kept 
cleam. It is therefore much used for coffeepots, chafing dishes and other utensils designed 
for table use. Its durability makes it desirable for use in institutions, but its weight and 
cost bar it to a great extent from the private kitchen. Nickel-plated ware is kept in good 
condition by washing in hot soapsuds and rinsing in very hot water. It very rarely needs 
friction, but may be rubbed if necessary with a paste made of whiting and lard. 

Aluminum — Aluminum has come more and more into general use since the cost of 
producing it has ceased to bar it out. The advantage of aluminum utensils is that they are 
light, well made, easily cleaned, and are excellent conductors of heat. Milk, rice, sugar 
and other easily scorched foods are comparatively safe in aluminum. 

Aluminum does not withstand a high temperature. If heated over a gas or oil 
stove, the flame should not be turned on full ; if over wood or coal, the stove lid should be 
left on. Many complaints of the warping of aluminum have been due to not using this 
precaution. An aluminum utensil may be injured by allowing some foods to remain in 
it for any length of time. 

The outside of aluminum utensils can be kept bright by the use of any kind of 
metal polish that is not gritty. The inside surface is darkened by water containing alkalis or 
iron. This thin, dark coating is easily removed by the use of whiting or any of the 
cleaning powders that do not contain free alkali. If food or grease is burned into the sur- 
face, it can usually be soaked loose by keeping hot water in the utensil for several hours; 
after which it may be scraped with a wooden spoon. If this fails, the utensil may be 
scoured with fine sand or powdered emery or fine steel wool. The mild acid of sour milk 
or tart apples, boiled in aluminum, will brighten it very effectually. 

Copper — Copper is, next to silver, the best metallic conductor of heat. It? use in the 
household is limited because of its expense and weight, the danger from its use when not 
properly cleaned, and the labor involved in keeping it in good condition. Vegetables, acid 



KITCHEN HELPS— UTENSILS and MISCELLANEOUS 10' 



fruits, or preserves, if cooked in copper, should not be left for a moment after they are 
done. Copper and acid, when exposed to the air, form verdigris, which we all know to be 
very poisonous. The green coloring that forms when copper is exposed to moist air alone 
is not verdigris, although it is often so called. Copper cooking utensils should be washed 
with washing soda in order to remove all grease; stains should be removed with salt and 
vinegar, or with oxalic acid; and the utensil should then be thoroughly rinsed. Unless the 
acid used for cleaning is thoroughly rinsed off. copper will tarnish the more quickly because 
of its use. The acid may be further counteracted by rubbing with whiting. If not stained, 
copper is best brightened by rubbing with rottenstone or tripoli and sweet oil. 

SUver — Silver is of all metals the best conductor of heat, but its costliness bars it 
out as a cooking utensil. Silver has to be combined with copper in order to make a compound 
hard enough for use. Plated silver is copper with a thin coating of silver applied by elec- 
tricity. Silver does not tarnish, that is, grow dark, unless it comes in contact with sulphur. 
"Oxidized" silver has been treated with sulphur — in other words, purposely tarnished. If 
our silver discolors badly, there is an escape of sulphur either from our fires or from our 
lights; or the silver has been stored near rubber, or it has been wrapped in paper or cloth 
bleached with sulphur; or it has been used in eating eggs; or it has been handled with bare 
hands. The rule against handling silver with the bare hand in wiping it or in setting the 
table is a labor-saving one, since human perspiration contains sulphur and a warm, moist 
hand is sure to leave its mark. 

Cloudiness in silver, with no change of color, may be due to imperfect rinsing or 
to that film of dust and moisture present in any room not perfectly ventilated where human 
beings work and breathe. Plenty of hot soapsuds, careful rinsing and wiping, will remove 
this film without the need of much rubbing. To remove tarnish, the use of silver polish, 
or of something that replaces it, is necessary. Silver is successfully cleaned by boiling it for 
five minutes in a new or bright aluminum or tin dish, in a solution made of one tablespoon 
of baking soda and a tablespoon of salt to every quart of water. The aluminum utensil must 
be kept scoured or it will not be effective. Most silver polishes have whiting for a founda- 
tion, made into a paste with either water, soap and water, alcohol, or, for solid silver, am- 



monia. 



Pottery — Porcelain, stoneware and earthenware all have clay for a foundation, but 
differ in appearance and quality according to the fineness of the clay used, the kind of 
glaze applied, and the length of time taken for firing. Good stoneware can hardly be dis- 
tinguished at first glance from porcelain, but its glaze is of a kind that easily becomes 
scratched or covered with fine cracks. Earthenware is made of the cheapest grades of clay, 
and its glaze — which is produced by throwing common salt into the furnace during the 
firing of the ware — is easily chipped, exposing the very porous ware underneath. For 
this reason white stoneware mixing bowls are in the end cheaper than yellow earthenware. 

Fireproof ware is made of clay which contains little or no iron, and which therefore 
withstands fire. Utensils of this kind are often left unglazed, but more often they are cov- 
ered with a glaze that is fired at a sufficiently high temperature to make a hard, smooth, 
glassy surface, which is proof alike against high heat and the effect of acids. Fireproof 
earthenware has long been represented in our kitchens in the shape of the Boston bean pot. 
We now have, in addition, a large variety of "casserole" dishes. The economy of long, slow 
cooking, whereby the cheaper cuts of meat are made digestible and palatable, is being given 
more and more consideration. Utensils that are equally useful for cooking and serving save 
time and strength in addition. 

If stoneware, earthenware or china dishes are to be allowed, after washing, to dry 
without wiping, it is important that the rinsing water be very hot and very clean. Imper- 
fectly rinsed dishes, dried without wiping, become coated with a thin film which in time spoils 
the glaze. 



102 



THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Sec. IV— Pt. 2— COOKING AND RECIPES 



Glass — Glass is made by melting together sand, a lead or lime compound and a 
compound of soda or potash. The quality depends very much on the purity of the raw mate- 
rial. Glass is being more and more used in our kitchens, for measuring cups, rolling-pins, 
storage jars for cereals, milk bottles, jelly and preserving glasses. The glass door for our 
ovens and glass tops for our percolators not only save time and motions, but also satisfy the 
general desire to see things actually happening. Glass of good quality is durable if handled 
properly. , 

Wood — Steak Planks — With the passing of wood for other uses, many persons are 
just discovering that meat cooked on a well-seasoned oak plank has a flavor unlike any 
other, and comes near to filling the desire for "some new animal" which every household 
voices from time to time. A home carpenter may earn much gratitude by making one 
of these planks. It should be oval, an inch to an inch and a half thick, about eighteen inches 
long by twelve inches wide, with a depression at one end for holding the juices and with 
grooves leading toward the depression. As sold in the shops, the planks are furnished with 
trays on which to bring them to the table, but any oval tray fulfills the same purpose; in 
fact, the plank may be made to fit a tray already in use. To make the planks non-ab- 
sorbent, after thoroughly cleansing them rub in all the oil (suitable for coming in contact with 
food) that the wood will take up. 



KITCHEN UTENSILS— MISCELLANEOUS 



To Clean Granite Ware — (Cornell Reading 

Course) Apparatus: A vessel large enough to 

hold the utensil being cleaned, and one that will 
not be affected by strong soda solution: washing 
soda, bath brick, dishcloth and dish towel. 

Place the utensils to be cleaned in the larger 
vessel. Nearly fill with cold water. Add soda in 
the proportion of one-half cup soda to one quart 
cold water. Let boil for an hour until most of 
the dirt will rinse off readily. Take the utensils 
out of the water and rinse under the tap. If 
necessary scour the utensils with bath brick or 
Sapolio in order to remove obstinate spots. Wash 
like ordinary dishes. In extreme cases it may be 
necessary to repeat this operation several times. 

To Clean Ironware (Cornell Reading Course) 

— Apparatus: An old newspaper, a flannelette 
duster, a lump of beeswax or mutton fat tied in 
a square of cloth, a piece of old cloth for scour- 
ing, some coarse salt, and a basin of soapy water. 

Procedure to Season New Ironware Heat the 

iron utensil hot enough to melt the wax or fat. 
Spread the newspaper on the table; rub the uten- 
sil with the wax or fat. Wash in hot, soapy water. 
Repeat several times if necessary. 

To Clean Rusty Ironware — Spread the news- 
paper on the tabel. If very rusty rub the ironware 
with kerosene and let stand for an hour, or longer 
if necessary, before further treatment. Heat the 
utensil enough to melt the wax or fat. Rub with 
wax or fat until well covered; then scour off with 
salt. Wash the utensil with hot soapsuds and dry. 
Heat until thoroughly dry. If the weather is 
damp or the ironware is being put away for some 



time, rub with wax, vaseline or saltless fat of any 
kind, in order to prevent rust. 

Note — It may sometimes be necessary to use 
finely pulverized bathbrick in addition to the salt. 
Flatirons should be cleaned as described for iron- 
ware. 

To Clean Steel of rust, rub the rusted part ^vith 
sweet oil and allow to stand for 24 hours; then 
rub with a piece of soft leather and sprinkle with 
finely powdered unslaked lime until the rust dis- 
appears. 

To Clean Knives of rust, use a raw potato 
dipped in cleaning powder. 

Cake Griddle — Keep this in good condition 
largely by the vociferous use of sandpaper oc- 
casionally, using very little grease for frying the 
cakes. 

To Clean Brass and Copper — (Cornell Read- 
ing Course) — Apparatus: Rottenstone, sweet 
oil, scouring flannels, chamois skin, clean dry 
towel, and a saucer; also, if necessary, a soft 
brush. 

Wash the article in hot soapy water. If badly 
tarnished, it may be necessary to make a weak 
solution of oxalic acid and rub this over the 
article before washing it. The acid, however, is 
a dangerous thing to use if the skin is broken 
anywhere on the hands. It should be kept off 
the hands in any event. 

Mix a little paste of rottenstone and oil in the 
saucer and scour the brass vigorously with it. 
Be especially careful to get it into crevices and 
corners. 

Wash thoroughly with hot water and soap. 



KITCHEN HELPS— UTENSILS AND MISCELLANEOUS 



103 



rinse, and dry. If the article seems greasy after 
the washing, the water was not sufficiently soapy 
and the washing should be done over. 

Polish with chamois skin. 

Wash out the cloths and chamois skin and hang 
them up to dry. 

Note If the article is very badly tarnished it 

may be rubbed with fine emery paper, or finely 
pulverized pumice stone may be used as a paste 
with the acid or with water, rubbing vigorously. 

Brass Saucepan — To clean a brass saucepan or 
preserving can quickly, put in it a little bath- 
brick and moisten it with vinegar; this will at 
once remove the stain. 

Copper Kettles, etc., may often be cleaned by 
rubbing all over with a cut lemon dipped in salt, 
then rinsing thoroughly with clear water and pol- 
ishing with a soft cloth or chamois. Or a little 
powdered bathbrick moistened with vinegar: mix 
to a paste and rub a little on the copper; let it 
stand for a time, then rub off and polish \vith a 
soft cloth; wash off and polish finally with 
chamois. 

To Clean Zinc — (Cornell Reading Course) 

Apparatus: The kerosene can, some cotton 
waste or an old cloth, a bottle of vinegar and 
alum mixture (see below) and an old pot. 

Take a piece of cotton waste or an old cloth, 
pour a little kerosene on the zinc, and spread it 
all over with the waste or cloth. Start at one 
corner with the waste or cloth and rub hard un- 
til the zinc is clean and bright. Finally, rub off 
all superfluous kerosene with a piece of fresh 
waste. 

If the zinc has been neglected and is very dirty, 
heat some of the vinegar and alum mixture in 
the old pot. Apply it hot, rub hard, and wipe 
off immediately. 

Burn the waste. 

Vinegar and Alum Mixture — 2 oz. powdered 
alum; I qt. strong vinegar. Boil the vinegar, add 
the alum, and stir until dissolved. Apply hot. 
Badly stained nickel can also be cleaned by boil- 
ing in this mixture until the stains begin to dis- 
appear, before polishing. Keep in a tightly corked 
bottle. 

To Clean Badly Stained Nickel — See immedi- 
ately above: vinegar and alum mixture for zinc. 

Tinware — Before using tinware of any kind, rub 
well over with fresh lard, to season, and fortify 
against rust later. To clean tinware, wash with 
hot soda water, dry, then polish with dry flour 
applied with soft leather, and then rub with leather 
only. 



Stains on Tinware or Teacups can be removed 
by dipping a damp cloth in common soda and 
rubbing briskly. Wash and wipe dry. 

Get a Wide-Mouthed Funnel and keep it on 
hand, among your tinware supplies: it is most 
convenient for pouring from one bowl to another; 
you will find use for it every day; it prevents 
spilling and slopping, which largely causes various 
stains on utensils generally, the thin coating of 
the spilled liquid burning dry immediately on the 
hot utensils. 

To Clean Pewter — Wash the article with hot 
water and fine silver sand; then dry and polish 
with a leather. Clean discolored pewter with 
sweet oil and whiting. 

Furred Kettle — Clean with sal-soda or sal- 
ammoniac. Fill the kettle with cold water, add 
a little sal-ammoniac, and boil. The fur will dis- 
solve. Rinse the kettle thoroughly and polish dry. 

Burned Pans Saucepans that have been burned 

should never be filled with soda water, as this 
makes them more liable to burn again the next 
time used. Instead, fill with salt and water, leave 
a few hours, then bring slowly to a boil; the 
burned particles will come off without difficulty. 

Stained Cruel — Fill cruet with finely chopped 
potato skins, cork tightly, let stand in a warm 
place for two or three days; then turn skins out 
and rinse cruet with warm water and borax. 

Chopping Bowl — Remove the odor of food 
from a wooden chopping bowl in boiling water 
in which a little soda is dissolved. A tablespoon 
of soda to a gallon of water. 

Cracked Dishes — If boiled in enough sweet milk 
to cover them for about 45 minutes the cracks 
will glue together and become invisible and the 
dishes will stand almost as much ordinary usage 
as before. 

Waish Linoleum and Oil Cloth with luke warm 
water, then polish it with a soft woolen cloth 
which has been dipped in milk. Wipe oil cloth 
with skimmed milk: it is almost as beneficial as 
a coat of varnish. Linoleum should have a coat 
of varnish, even two coats, when ne>v, before 
using, and an occasional coat afterwards: it will 
almost entirely prevent wear if applied frequently. 

Under the Oil Stove, try putting oil cloth on 
the shelf below the burners; it can be removed for 
washing, and will prove less trouble than scouring 
the shelf itself and is less mussy than a drip pan 
for this purpose. 



1 04 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Sec. IV— Pt. 2— COOKING AND RECIPES 



A Box of Salt, a large one, should always be 
near the kitchen stove, not alone for its conve- 
nience for cooking, but in case of fat boiling over 
and catching fire; the fire may be instantly put 
out by dashing on a handful of salt. It is almost 
the only good and instant means for smothering 
any sudden flare-up of fire. It takes time to beat 
out a flame by wetting a cloth for the purpose, 
and water is likely to spread fire around a stove 
where grease or fat catches the flame. A box of 
salt always handy is almost as effective as an 
expensive fire extinguisher. 

CofFee-Grounds, left over, slightly moistened, 
make fine dust-down for sweeping floors; it is 
clean and will not stain. 

Opening Fruit Jars Instead of prying open 

with a knife, just hold the top (upside down) in 

hot water for a few minutes just dip in the top, 

not the body of the jar — and the lid will come off 
easily without danger of cutting the hands. In 
prying, the tool may slip, or the top of the jar 
itself, giving one a bad cut. 

To Remove Stopper from a bottle without mu- 
tilating it with a corkscrew, or to remove wooden 
or glass stoppers which stick, cut a narrow strip 
of sandpaper and, holding it tightly around the 
stopper, twist the stopper; the sandpaper gives the 
fingers a "purchase" so they do not slip. A large 
rubber band wound tightly around the stopper 
will perform the same function. A wider piece 
of sandpaper may be used for unscrewing the 



cover of a fruit jar. The narrow strip is used 
again for a hot water bottle the top of which 
has stuck. 

A Glass Stopper may often be removed by in- 
serting in the crack of a door at the hinged side. 
Close the door as tightly as you can on the stop- 
per without breaking it and then twist the bottle 
gently back and forth. ^ 

Or: hold the bottle firmly by the same means, 
or have an assistant hold it. Take two turns 
around the neck with a heavy, rough, strong 
cord. Holding an end of the cord in each hand, 
pull one end and then the other, causing the cord 
to set up a high friction to the neck of the bottle. 
The heat expands the glass of the neck slightly 
but does not penetrate to the glass stopper so 
rapidly. The stopper is release for easy removal. 

Paraffin the Corks of bottles, set away for a 
time, or for prevention of leakage when packing 
bottles for traveling, either bottles containing 
medicine or any other liquids. Paraffin seals the 
corks or other tops tightly from air and tends to 
preserve contents as ■well as prevent leakage. 
Simply dip the corked tops into melted paraffin 
and set away to cool. 

Movable Kitchen Table Put casters on kitchen 

table. It is surprising how often it is convenient 
to move a table around if it moves easily and 
conveniently. A movable table, at times, saves 
lots of steps.

MAKESHIFT KITCHEN APPLIANCES 

The housewife who is ingenious enough to supply a sudden need for a 
certain article from something in no wise intended for the purpose has gone far 
towards solving the question of efficiency. 

The possibilities of cans and boxes is infinite. Take the oval cans in which 
soused mackerel comes; these, if the top is removed or melted off close to the 
side and edges smoothed, make most excellent jelly or pudding moulds, and are 
convenient for many purposes. 

If the double boiler is missing or has sprung a leak, a good substitute will be found 
in a coffee can which is slipped inside the tea kettle. Should it prove a bit too small, 
cut down an inch or two, leaving an inch strip at the seam and another opposite, and it 
is handy for many other purposes for insertion into the kettle — to make paste in or to melt 
glue. 

A tin collar for a stovepipe and a tin pail or other vessel which will fit snugly inside 
it makes an excellent double boiler when set over a pan or kettle of boiling water; and a very 
ideal way to bake potatoes is found in the use of a wire trivet placed on top of the stove 
with a round cake pan turned over it; this does away with the necessity of waiting for the 
oven to heat, for by the time it is hot enough to bake, the potatoes will be more than half 
done. Biscuit may even be baked in this way, and the top of the heating stove may be used 
quite as well as the range. 

When the fire is allowed to die down between meals, a wood or coal fire being 
used, one does not always care to go to the trouble of starting one just for a light evening 
meal, and if a gas or oil stove is not used one may improvise a very good substitute by 
setting a large lamp in a box with one end removed and placing an oven rack across the 
top, a couple of inches over the chimney. On this improvised stove one may boil the tea 
kettle, fry potatoes, poach eggs, and do other little culinary stunts. This will be found invalu- 
able on moving days when the range is not yet set up or the gas turned on. In the summer 
camp it is a find indeed, and with the use of the triple stewpans, which cook three sepa- 
rate things over one burner, a creditable dinner may be evolved by its use. 

A suds dipper which has begun to leak needs only a few more holes punched in 
the bottom to make a superior sink strainer — because of the convenient handle. The lid 
of a workman's dinner pail makes an excellent biscuit cutter, being of about the right size 
for pocketbook rolls, for which the ordinary biscuit cutter is too small. The top from 
a coffee can, if not too large, or some other similar can, makes as good a biscuit cutter as 
can be purchased. The bottom of a colander should not be thrown away, but saved to 
put in the bottom of the kettle under the pot roast to prevent its sticking and scorching. A 
dozen pot lid knobs that can be bought on any five-cent counter are a good investment; they 
will not only replace lost knobs on pot covers, but can be used to convert the tops of tin 
cans into covers for small basins, bowls, pails and the like. The cover of an ordinary 
lard pail when fitted with a knob and punctured makes an excellent cutter for short-cake 
biscuit.

There is an improved lid on the market that should supersede the old fashioned lid 
entirely — a lid of gray enamel with a handle on the side ending in a hook for hanging 
it up. Half a dozen assorted sized lids may be hung on one nail. They can be used 
for other purposes than as lids — to set the hot kettle or pan on when dishing up on the 
table or to lift the meat from the kettle.

WASHING THE DISHES AND CLEANING UTENSILS 

Dish Washing — (Cornell Reading Course) — Apparatus: Dishpan, rinsing pan, drain- 
ing pan and basket, dishcloth, several clean, dry dish towels, boiling water, soap and washing 
soda. 

Put iron pots and pans to soak in strong soda water, also put to soak any cooking 
dishes that need it. Put one inside another so as to clean the outside also. This should 
be done the moment the contents are emptied, and before the meal goes to the table. 

Clean the dining table, and leave the room in order. 

Put the food away, scrape and stack the dishes at the washing end of the table, 
putting to soak any that need it. 

Set out the pans, with the draining basket in the rinsing pan. Half fill the dishpan 
with hot, soapy water, three-quarters fill the rinsing pan with nearly boiling water. 

Wash the glass, dropping each piece gently into the basket. Put flat silver into the 
dishwater to soak. Lift the basket of glass into the draining pan, dry the glass and set it 
aside. Use the softest towels for this and see that the glass is left shining. (If you prefer 
the glass dried out of cold water, use it, and then fill the pan with boiling water. ) 

Return the basket to the rinsing pan. Wash, rinse and dry the silver the same as 
the glass. The towels must be dry for the silver. 

Wash, rinse, and dry the small china pieces the same as glass, and put away the 
basket. 

Wash, rinse, and leave the rest of the china and crockery to drain, while the pots 
and pans are being washed. 

Dry the china and crockery, rinse and dry the pots and pans. Scour the steel knives 
and forks. 

Put away all the dishes. 

Empty the dishpan, put rinsing water in it, wash the other pans, dry with the cloth 
wrung dry, and put them away. 

If the rinsing water is still clean and warm, scrub the table and the sink with it; if 
not, get fresh water. Wash the teakettle, inside and out, once a day, when the water is 
soapy. 

Put towels and dishcloth to soak in hot, soapy water. This need be done but once 
a day, usually after the midday meal. 

Rub off the stove. Sweep the kitchen floor. Empty the garbage pail. 

Wash the towels and dishcloth. Rinse the pail out with the suds, and dry with the 
cloth wrung dry. Rinse the towels thoroughly in hot water and hang to dry, in fresh air 
if possible. 

Dust the kitchen once a day. 

Note: The dishwater should be kept hot and soapy enough to prevent the forma- 
tion of a grease-ring on the pan, and should be changed when dirty. Keep the rinsing 
water very hot, thus requiring fewer towels.

COOKING HINTS 

In cookery, as in dress, a woman should remember that if she cannot afFord 
to employ an artist she should not attempt things which are beyond the powers of 
any but an expert. She who tries to hide the evil cut of her dress with yards of 
trimmings is on a par in lack of taste with the cook who meikes wonderful con- 
coctions of pounded chicken elaborately encased in aspic and trimmed with stars 
and stripes and other shapes of tongue, white of egg and truffles, and which 
tastes of nothing but white of egg and truffles. 

It must not be thought, however, that the appearance of food may be 
slighted. It is of great importance — almost as great as the cooking and flavoring. 
No matter how inexpensive the food, it should be nicely served, and no sloven- 
liness should be allowed even in the most simple of family meals. On the other 
hand, the garnishing of the most elaborate dish should never be permitted to mar 
its taste or temperature. To that end, hot dishes must be generally less elaborate 
than cold. 



To Whip Thin Cream — Thin cream, too thin 
to whip properly, will whip better if the white of 
one egg is added, or two whites if there is a 
large amount of the cream. The egg improves 
both the quality and the quantity. 

Whites of Eggs — A teaspoonful of cold water 
added to whites of eggs will cause them to whip 
easily and quickly. 

Pickles may be kept from becoming mouldy by 
laying a little bag of mustard on the top of the 
pickle jar. 

Hashes and Minces are much improved if the 
meat is soaked in the gravy or sauce some time 
before being reheated. 

Salt That Lumps — Add a little cornstarch to 
the salt before filling. 

Spread Papers over your kitchen table before 
starting to clean poultry, or to make bread or 
pies: they catch waste and save much cleaning up 
later. 

No Tears with Onions — Scalding water poured 
over onions saves "v^eeps.** 

Preserved Provisions, when opened, and only a 
part of the contents removed, should be emptied 
of all at once, and the unused portions put in 
earthen or glass vessels. The air acting upon the 
tin and the solder causes the acid contents to 
dissolve parts of the minerals. 

Lemon Rinds — Save them, dry them in the 
oven and store them in an air tight vessel. A 
little added to apple sauce gives it a delicious 
flavor, and it has other uses for seasoning. 



Use a Soft Brush for brushing bread rolls and 
pastry with melted butter — such a brush as is 
used for varnishing. 

Before Grating Lemons wash them in a basin 
of lukewarm water; the outside of the lemon i» 
often not very clean; examine a lemon under a 
microscope and you will find tiny black spots 
which are the minute eggs of an insect. 

Sugar Syrup — A small quantity of cream of tar- 
tar in it will prevent the syrup becoming granu- 
lated. 

Currant Jelly should be used for game and 
custards and bread puddings. 

Keep on Hand always a quantity of grated 
bread crumbs, grated cheese, good vinegar, herbs 
and spices, as these are indispensable and you 
often want them without warning. 

Mint, either with or without parsley, is served 
with roast lamb, both hot and cold. Dry mint, 
and put it away for future use. 

Save the Sprigs of celery tops and use them 
for salads and cold meats, or dry them and put 
away for the future. 

Cooking Raisins — To keep moist, keep in a 
glass fruit jar. 

Cheese To prevent becoming dry or mouldy, 

wrap in a cloth which has been moistened in 
vinegar. 

Wire Spoon — Use for removing doughnuts 
from hot fat. Other uses suggest themselves if 
you have it.

Lemons can be kept soft much longer if put 
in a jar filled with water, the water being renewed 
every second day. 

Tomatoes and Milk to be blended must be 
brought to the same temperature and beaten to- 
gether vigorously; there is less liability of curd- 
ling. 

A Saucepan in which rice, oatmeal or any- 
thing sticky has been cooked may be very easily 
cleaned by putting in a cupful of ashes and fill 
with water when you take it off the fire. 

Sugar Used in Pie Put the sugar always in the 

centre of the fruit, not at the top, as this makes 
the paste sodden. 

Overheated Oven — Put a bowl of cool water in- 
side to cool it. 

Burnt Milk — Take the pan off the fire and 
stand it at once in a basin of cold water. Put a 
pinch of salt in the pan, give the milk a stir, and 
you will find that the burnt taste has almost if 
not quite disappeared. 

After Eating Onions — Coffee beans, cloves, 
sugar or parsley moistened with sugar will prevent 
the onions from being noticeable on the breath. 

Substitute for Maple Sugar — Equal parts of 
granulated white and dark brown sugar, with one- 
half the quantity of water added, and boiled until 
of desired thickness. When cold, add three drops 
of vanilla extract. Much of the cheap "maple- 
ized" sugar you buy is only the above with per- 
haps a few drops of maple syrup to further flavor. 



Wooden Spoon should be used for stirring in 
preference to an iron one; the latter will often 
scratch tin or cause discoloration in the food; 
the acid in the food working on the metal ^vill 
do the latter. 

Odors When cooking anything which has a 

strong odor put a small pan of vinegar in the 

stove and there will be no scent of cooking in 
the air. 

Soggy Bread or Pastry — When serving hot bread 
or pastry, use hot plates; the most delicious be- 
come soggy when served on cold plates. 

Cream Pitcher — Cream may be prevented from 
dripping from the spout by rubbing the inside of 
the spout with a little butter. 

Soak Nuts in hot water for an hour or two 
and they will crack easier and the meats come 
out whole with less trouble to pick. 

To Open Cocoanut Place it first in the oven 

for a few minutes; the warmth n)akes opening 
easier. 

Cracker Dust — Always keep a jar of cracker 
dust on hand for breading unless you have no 
bread crumbs for the purpose. 

Dates or Figs When running these through the 

mincing machine add a few drops of lemon juice 
to prevent the fruit from clogging. 

Cutting Hot or Brown Bread — Use a silk or linen 
thread or fine vjrire instead of a knife and the 
bread will crumble less.

LEFT-OVER FOODS 

(Iowa State College of Agriculture) 

"WASTE NOT, WANT NOT* 

The American housekeeper has had an unenviable reputation as a careless buyer, a 
thoughtless manager and a reckless waster of foods. In no other way has this been more 
apparent than in the custom in many homes to throw away bits of leftover food materials 
which might be put to good use. Much more credit is due to the woman who, as far as 
possible prevents the accumulation of leftovers, but who uses them wisely as they are found, 
than to the woman who cooks fresh food attractively and well, but who throws away foods 
which still contain food value and which might form the basis of palatable dishes. 



LEFTOVERS AND SOME USES 

Bread — 

White, graham, whole wheat, corn, rye. 

Toast. 

Biscuit. 

Pancake or waffle batter. 

Meat and Eggs — 

Beef, pork, ham, bacon, chicken, fish; eggs 

— boiled, fried or scrambled. 

Gravy. 

Vegetables — 

String beans, onions, potatoes, beans, peas, 

corn. 
Cereals — 

Rice, macaroni, oatmeal, cornmeal, cream or 

wheat, hominy. 

Fruit Sauces — 

Apple, prune, rhubarb, cranberry, etc. 

Fats — 

Suet, bacon fat, meat fryings, chicken fat, 
butter. 

Prevent Leftovers (When Possible) 
1 - By Careful Planning — Do not serve too 
many kinds of food at each meal. Provide variety 
betw^een meals. Do not cook too great an amount 
of each food. 

2. By Careful Serving — Do not serve too gen- 
erously. It is better to have a second helping in 
reserve, so that if not eaten it may be used later. 

Use Leftovers (When at Hand) 
1 . Practice Economy — True not False — Other 
things than money should be considered in prac- 
ticing economy. The fuel to be used; the time 
to be spent; the food value to be saved and the 
additions that must be made should all be taken 
into account. Use good judgment in the selec- 
tion of leftovers to be used. 



2. Consider Appearance — More skill is needed 
to make leftover dishes attractive than the fresh 
foods. The wise housekeeper will remember this 
and make her leftover dishes as attractive in ap- 
pearance as she can. 

3. Prevent Monotony — Practice making many 
different leftover dishes. The family will soon 
tire of the same food cooked in the same ^vay 
many times. 

4. Provide Flavor — Remember that many left- 
over foods, particularly meats, have lost their 
original flavor and must be made tenipting if they 
are to prove popular w^ith the family in the made- 
over dish. This does not mean that extravagant 
flavorings must be used, however. Select the 
highly flavored vegetables, as well as the standard 
seasonings.

PLAIN PATTERNS IN COOKERY 

(Iowa State College of Agriculture) 

Many housewives, especially those who have had little experience in cook- 
ing, are dependent upon the cook book to such a degree that they are unable to 
prepare a dish without it. It is unfortunate that this is true, for often much time 
and effort are spent searching for certain recipes which are not at all difficult if 
the fundamental principles are understood. Tliere are certain underlying prin- 
ciples which govern all recipes. These principles may be worked out in a system 
of plain patterns which may form the basis of much of the cooking.

CLASS 1 

Soup should be a frequent indulgence in every dietary. Cream soups and 
purees are most appetizing and nutritious. Clear soups are excellent stimulants 
to appetite and are hardly equalled in food value. All soups well made are easy 
of full assimilation. 

Soups are made with and without meat stocks. 

MEAT STOCK SOUPS ARE: 
Bouillon — from lean beef, clear and seasoned. Clam bouillon is an exception. 
Consomme — from two or more kinds of meat, seasoned with vegetables and other- 
wise; usually clear. 

Brown Soup — from lean beef browned and seasoned. 

NON-MEAT STOCK SOUPS ARE: 
Puree — with the pulp of cooked vegetables added to milk or cream. Milk is thick- 
ened with cornstarch or flour; stock sometimes added. 

Cream Soup — made thinner than puree — of vegetables or fish, with milk, or some 
cream, or both, and seasoned; thickened to taste. 



The Elconomical Stock-pot — It may seem easy to put a bone into some water and let 
it boil hard for several hours. But the result is not apt to be the most flavorful and 
nutritious soup, in making all of the stock soups, the meat, bones, etc., should be put into 
cold water to which salt has been added, and allowed to come to a boil very slowly, so as 
to extract the juices before the tissues become toughened. At no time is it necessary to 
boil furiously. Indeed, the word "simmer" is peculiarly expressive for soups. 

Meat Soups are made from scraps, left-overs, bones, trimmings, from steak or roasts, 
or from cheap cuts bought for the purpose, such as shins, neck or shoulder cuts, or lower 
round cuts. The tougher parts are richer in the extracts and in soluble albumen. 

Use a porcelain or granite kettle, cover tight-fitting, and strainer, colendar fine sieve 
and strainer. A good fireless cooker is most excellent. 

To Make Plain Soup Stock — Clean the meat, wiping with dry or damp cloth, sepa- 
rate the bone and fat. Cut meat into small pieces, place in kettle with one teaspoonful salt 
to quart of water. Cook at low temperature six or seven hours. Add other seasoning last 
half-hour. 

Do not remove scum until just before serving, as the scum contains nutritive ele- 
ments; some prefer the scum not removed. 

A layer of fat forms: do not remove this until stock is used, as it protects by 
excluding the air. Save the fat, when removed, for drippings.

1 1 8 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Sec. IV— Pt. 2— COOKING AND RECIPES 

Clear the soup with white and shell of one egg to each quart stock. Break and 
beat together, add to the stock, set on fire, stir to boiling point, boil two or three minutes, 
skim, strain and serve. Add more seasoning, if desired, before clearing. Strain through 
filter paper for perfect clearness. 

Thicken soup with wheat or rice or leftover cereal, flour or cornstarch, mixed with 
cold water or milk to smooth paste, more liquid then added until thin: cook 15 minutes 
after thickening. 

If butter is added, melt until bubbling, then stir in a little flour; add gradually a cup 
of hot soup, cook, thicken, stir it into the soup; cook the soup then 15 minutes. Bread, 
dried and browned, and added to a cup of stock, may be used instead of flour; simmer until 
soft, crush and dilute with soup I/2 cup dried bread to 1 quart finished soup. Use wheat or rye 
bread as preferred. 

Glace is clear stock boiled down to about a fourth of original amount; to almost a 
glue state; will keep for weeks, in a close jar in cool place. Use for enriching a weak stock, 
for gravy, for browning meats, or to add to sauce. 

Vegetable Stock — the water in which vegetables have been cooked. It is rich in salts 
and flavors. Water from cooked macaroni, barley and rice should be retained for soups. 

Seasoning for Soups — Keep on hand: dried celery or celery roots; sweet herbs, 
thyme, parsley, savory, celery salt or celery seed, marjoram; spices, cloves, stick cinnamon, 
allspice, whole pepper. Arrowroot, sago, tapioca, barley, rice, bread, eggs, cornstarch, flour 
are added to give flavor as well as for nourishment and thickening. 

The Basis for Cream Soups — The cream soups may seem at first more difficult, but 
a little practice will show that a cream soup is one of the easiest to prepare. The basis is a 
thin, white sauce in about the following proportions: I tbsp. of butter, 1 tbsp. of flour, I cup- 
ful of milk or cream and Ya teasp. each of salt and white pepper. 

To this can be added from '/2 'o ' cupful of pulp of any kind of vegetables or fish, 
or water in which vegetables have been cooked, with I tbsp. flour for each cup of liquid 
added. In most cases it is necessary to cook the vegetables separately with water, as car- 
rots, dried peas, lentils, corn, etc. The mixture is poured through a strainer by using a 
wooden pestle or masher. 

The resulting pulp is added to the above cream mixture. 

As a general rule, the food should not cook after the puree has been added, only 
heated through and served at once. Puree should be neither thick and cloying, nor dis- 
agreeably thin, because the puree and the milk have not been sufficiently blended. The ideal 
puree is of the consistency of a thick cream very well blended. 

Save the stale pieces of bread frequently thrown out. Cut into slices or julienne 
strips, brush with butter and brown in the oven, or saute in a skillet, then serve floating in 
the soup. Whipped cream also brings up the fat and makes a pleasing garnish. 

Pimento gives a piquant touch to a plain cream puree. A delicious cream soup is 
made of corn and served with buttered pop-corn kernels floating on top. 

Grated egg yolk is another attractive garnish. In fact, the cream soup offers 
endless possibilities. In our search for nourishing food at low cost, all soup should find a 
larger place.

SOUP RECIPES 



Soups — The foundation of all soups is either 
meat stock made from beef, veal, chicken, etc., 
or vegetable stock, or milk. 

Plain Soup Stock — I lb. each of lean beef and 
veal cut in cubes, 2 lbs. cracked marrow bones. 
Cover with cold \vater and bring slowly to scald- 
ing point. Close the pot; simmer several hours. 
The last hour add stalks of celery, a turnip, car- 
rot, onion, salt, pepper. After cooling stock skim 
off fat, strain and clear according to previous 
directions. 

Many varieties of soups and broths may be 
founded upon this stock. 

Brown Stock — Brown in drippings, I lb. beef 
cut small, add 2 lbs. raw beef and bones. Cover 
with cold water. Proceed as with Plain Stock. 

White Stock Use either chicken cut up or 

veal. Make as for Plain Stock, adding a lighter 
seasoning, such as celery, few grains paprika, salt, 
chopped parsley. Cool, remove all fat, strain and 
clear. This is a delicate stock foundation for 
soup for young children or convalescents. 

A dinner soup preceding a heavy meal should 
be light, clear, hot, and served with bread, or 
breadsticks. 

Bouillon (A Clear Soup) — Allow I pt. of water 
to each lb. beef and bone. Cut up meat; cover 
with cold water and let stand I hour. Heat gradu- 
ally to boiling; simmer several hours until all 
strength is out of meat. Season with salt and 
pepper. Also celery and onion if desired. Cool 
until grease rises and hardens, skim, strain and 
clear. Serve very hot. 

Chicken Bouillon — Cut up a 4-lb. fowl. Cover 
with 4 qts. cold water; bring slowly to a boil. 
Simmer until meat falls from bones. Last Yl hour 
season lightly with celery salt, pepper, onion 
juice. Cool, remove fat, strain out bones and 
meat, clear, serve hot. 

Queen of Hearts Bouillon — Boil 2 doz. chopped 
oysters in I pt. cold water, 5 minutes. Strain, 
season to taste. Just before serving, drop tiny 
heart-shaped pieces of pimientoes into each cup 
of bouillon. Serve with bread cut into small 
heart-shapes, toasted. 

Jellied Bouillon — To I qt. boiling hot beef or 
chicken stock add 1 tbsp. granulated gelatine 
softened in Yl ^"P cold water. Strain into bouillon 
cups. Serve ice cold. Garnish each portion with 
chopped parsley sprinkled over I tcasp. of whipped 
cream. 

Bouillon Cubes — When it is inconvenient, be- 
cause of lack of time or materials, to make meat 
or vegetable stock, the modern house%vife can use 
the compressed meat and vegetable cubes now on 
the market. They may be used plain with boiling 
water for bouillons or as a foundation for heavier 
soups. 



Consomme (Clear Soup) — Brown 3 lbs. diced 
lean beef in suet with Yl sliced onion. Cover 
with 2 qts. cold water, simmer in closed pot sev- 
eral hours. Add I carrot, turnip, celery, 2 cloves, 
parsley. Cook I hour longer. Strain, cool, skim 
off fat. Reheat to boiling. Stir in white of I egg 
beaten in 2 tbsp. cold water. Remove from fire,

rice, or barley previously soaked 1 2 hours. Cook 
until cereal is done. 

Oxtail Soup — Wash 1 oxtail, cut up at joints. 
Brown I minced onion in suet, add Yl oxtail 
pieces dredged in flour. Season \vith salt and 
pepper. Add other Yl oxtail, Yl teasp. salt, tiny 
bag of several mixed spices and water to cover 
all. Simmer about 3 hours. Remove browned 
meat to be served with soup. Continue cooking 
until remainder falls from bones. Strain, cool, 
skim off cold fat. If flavoring is not satisfactory, 
add more salt and pepper or some brown stock, 
or reheat for 20 minutes with minced vegetables 
as onion, carrot, turnip, celery. 

Julienne (A Clear Soup with Shredded Vege- 
tables) — Use I pt. of such vegetables as may be 
convenient or even leftovers, as peas, string 
beans, or asparagus, onion, celery, turnip, carrot, 
cabbage. Cut them into small fancy shapes, boil 
in salted water until tender. Add I qt. strong 
soup stock. Cook gently 1 5 minutes. Before 
serving, add chopped parsley to taste and boil up 
once. 

Thickened Soups — Soups which form an entire 
meal or precede a light lunch should be of a 
nutritious character rather than mainly stimulat- 
ing, as are clear soups. 

Chicken Bisque (Stock Thickened with Minced 

Meat and Crumbs) Cut up I chicken. Simmer 

in cold water as for Plain Stock, adding minced 
onion and celery. Remove bones, when cold chop

THE TERM MEAT is the name given to the flesh of all animals that is 
used for food. Meat is principally albuminoids, fats, mineral matter, and water. 
Albumen makes blood and muscle. It dissolves in cold w^ater and coagulates by 
the application of heat, beginning to coagulate at 1 35 degrees Fahrenheit and 
solidifying at 160 degrees. Meat, therefore, should be cooked in water below the 
boiling point, and in boiling and roasting a high temperature used to quickly 
harden the surface so that the juices are retained. 

Remove meat from paper as soon as it comes; wipe with a damp cloth 
and place in a cool, clean place. See that it is uniform in color, and firm and 
elastic. Select beef with cream colored fat, avoid the dark yellow fat, which indi- 
cates an old animal. 

The tender cuts of meat are most expensive; the cheaper cuts, not in so 
high demand, are the most highly flavored and most nutritious, but require more 
care and more time in properly cooking. 



COOKING METHODS 

Roasting — The meat should rest about an inch from the bottom of the pan, on 
roasting rack. To prepare rub the meat with salt and pepper, and dredge with flour for 
dry surface. If meat is very lean its flavor is improved by placing over the surface thin 
slices of fat meat, its own fat, or bacon or pork, leaving it there until there are sufficient 
drippings in which to baste the joint, an equal amount of water being added to the bast- 
ing drippings. When done, remove to hot platter, draining off the fat, then add sufficient 
water to dissolve the glaze in the pan. This makes the gravy, which may be thickened 
with brown roux or served "au jus." 

The time varies, but this method is the same for all roasted meats. 

Broiling means cooking by direct exposure over flame or coals. First sear the sur- 
face by exposing to intense heat at once; this retains the juices. The exposure is then 
reduced somewhat to secure thorough cooking vsrithout scorching the exterior. 

Pan-Broiling — A steel or iron frying pan is highly heated, then rubbed with fat 
meat until well greased. The meat is seasoned and laid in pan only long enough to sear 
well on under side, then turned to sear the other side, continuing the turning to retain the 
juices, reducing the heat, to cook more slowly until done. 

Braising — This is sometimes confused with roasting, but is essentially different if 
done correctly. It is especially suitable for tough cuts or those lacking in flavor. 

Use a deep pan with close cover. These are frequently sold as roasters when only in 
reality braising pans. Tlie parts fit together tightly to confine the steam and the meat is 
cooked thus: in its own vapor. The toughest cuts may be cooked as tender as veal. 
Lemon juice is an excellent addition, and improves the gravy left in the pan. 

123 



1 24 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Sec. IV— Pt. 2— COOKING AND RECIPES 



Braising permits laying the meats on a bed of vegetables or herbs, the juices of 
which add to the flavor, the whole making a most appetizing, satisfying combination to 
the palate. 

Very dry meats, braised, may be improved by "daubing." Ordinary cuts will cook 
well in their steam alone, especially with the lemon juice, or some vegetables. 

Sauteing — To cook in shallow, hot pan with a little fat, browning alternately on 
one side and the other. 

Frying — To cook in hot fat deep enough to entirely cover the meat. 

Dipping Mixtures — If meat mixtures do not contain eggs, dip in crumbs and egg, 
for a surface to prevent the food from absorbing fat in frying. The albumen of the egg 
hardens and forms a protecting coat. 

Boiling — Follow the principle of high heat at first until a layer of albumen hardens 
to retain the meat juices; then drop temperature to a simmer and cook very slowly until 
the tissues are almost ready to fall apart. Cool partly in the liquor; serve on very hot plates. 

For Larding — Use salt pork fat, shaving off the rind; cut the fat into quarter-inch 
strips and cut these into quarter-inch strips the other way. Draw these strips into the meat 
with a larding needle, evenly and in alternate rows, until entire upper surface is covered. 

Daubing — This refers to the process of forcing the large lardings through the meat 
from one surface to the other. 

Never Wash Beef — Scrape, if necessary, or wipe with damp cloth, but never put in 
the water; keep it in a cool place, but not directly on the ice; obviously this means the lower 
part of the refrigerator.

CLASS 2— MEATS— DIAGRAMS OF CUTS 




MUTTON OR VEAL 
As Shown in This Diagram, the Cuts of Mutton or Veal Are Fewer Them 
Those of Beef, But It Is None the Less Important to the Buyer of 
Meats to Be Thoroughly Familiar with Them. 



CHOOSING MEATS 
LEARNING THE CUTS 

In selecting beef for roasts or steaks see that the lean is firm and red and 
that the meat is finely grained. The fat should be firm and white. Never ac- 
cept any meat which looks flabby or discolored or on which the fat is yellow. In 
choosing mutton the meat should be dark with plenty of fat in it. Meat without 
fat shows poorly fed stock. If the fat is yellow and the meat looks wet or moist 
do not accept it. As a general rule, sJl meat should be firm, never flabby. Lamb 
and Veal should both be light-colored — pale. Veal, in fact, cannot be too white. 

BEEF CUTS 

TTie question of cuts is largely one of preparation and cooking. In food value there 
is no such thing as good, better, or best cuts. The palate or neck contain as much nourish- 
ment as porterhouse steak; the difference is merely texture and flavor — and the so-called 
tender, and expensive cuts, which have the desirable texture without much cooking, as a rule 
do not have as fine flavor as the so-called tough cuts have when properly dealt with. 

The problem is only one of making the cheaper cuts come out without losing their 
inherent flavor by bad cooking methods, such as letting their juices escape and doing them 
thereby to an insipidity merely because they have to be cooked for a longer time. 

In buying, learn the following simple facts: Beef is divided into two sides, and these 
again into fore and hind quarters. 

The Ribs are on the forequarters. The first seven are called the prime ribs, the 
others the chuck ribs. The prime ribs are divided into the first cut, the best, three ribs; 
the second, two ribs; the third, two. 

The ribs are usually roasted, the ribs left in or the roast rolled. The meat is more 
juicy with ribs left in. If removed, remember they are weighed in before removed and 
you therefore pay for them and they are yours. Have the bones cracked, then take them 
along, cook slowly in a little water and you have broth for soups or for flavoring uses. 

The Neck is tough but very nutritious and very sweet meat; it is generally used for 
stew or mince meat. The palate is used in the same way, contains more fat and is less tough. 
With the brisket and the navel it is used for corned beef. 

The Shoulder has two cuts, known as the cross rib and the shoulder clod. They are 
tough, but free from bone and of good flavor. They make most excellent pot roast, They 
need long, slow cooking. 

The Hind Quarter — The best part is the sirloin or prime steaks, which is the por- 
tion between the rump and the ribs. 

Porterhouse — That between the last rib and the hip bone is called the porterhouse. 
Inside the bone the tenderloin is found. This is called "T" bone steaks when removed be- 
fore being cut — from the shape of the bone. 

The Sirloin Proper is divided into three parts: the hip bone, which is nearest the 
porterhouse; the flat bone, which is next, and is very good if you can cajole the butcher 
not to sell you all bone; and the round bone, nearest the rump. 

The Rump is in two parts, the top and lower. These are used for roasts; also the 
top sirloin, which lies below the sirloin steaks proper. 

126 



CLASS 2— MEATS— CHOOSING MEATS 127 

The Leg — The upper part is called the round, the first two cuts of which, above the 
bone, are very tender. Below the joint it is called the shank, and is used principally for soups. 
The Best Beef comes from corn-fed steers of about three years age. 

VEAL, MUTTON, LAMB, PORK 
AND 
MISCELLANEOUS 

Veal quality depends upon age. Calves six to ten weeks old cure best. Under six 
weeks veal is not good food; it is known as "bob-veal." In many states the law forbids the 
sale of veal under four weeks old, but does not always prohibit it successfully. It has a blu- 
ish tint and the muscles are soft and undeveloped. Meat is sold as veal from calves up 
to one year old. 

Veal should be white and pink, with firm grain and much white fat; the fat cannot 
be too white. 

The cuts run as in beef. The top round is usually called fricandeau of veal. It is 
generally roasted. The leg and shoulder are boned and roasted. 

Mutton, if not carefully dressed, may be materially affected in flavor, due to cer- 
tain oil in the skin which if carelessly removed gives the meat a disagreeable, strong taste. 

English mutton has smaller bones to larger proportions of meat; mutton at best has a 
large relative weight of bone to muscle. 

The meat should be fine grained, red and juicy, the fat white and firm, and thick 
on the legs and back. 

The Saddle — If not divided down the back, the ribs and loin together is called the 
short saddle. The long saddle takes in the back entirely to the tail, which is left on. 

The Haunch is the hindquarter taken as a whole. 

Lamb is in Season May to November. Lamb sold in winter is undersized mutton, 
and is tough and dry — or is from the cold storage house. 

Pork — Pork should be pink, the fat firm and white, although the fat may become 
pink after salt is applied. 

Diseased pork has a dull appearance and shows yellow lumps here and there 
in the flesh. 

Summer Fresh Pork is undesirable. It should be prohibited from May 1st until 
December 1 st, or later. 

Poultry — This is treated so fully under Poultry Recipes Department that it "begs 
to be excused" under this general talk on Meats in this section. 

Meat Trunmings — These belong to the purchaser — they are paid for — the meat is 
invariably weighed before the butcher asks if he shall trim or dress it for you. 

The Feet of fowls contain gelatine and other valuable additions to gravies and soups. 
Those of calves, hogs and sheep make soups or jellies, or can be boiled, pickeled, fried 
in butter or stewed, or with parts of the head make scrapple. The heads of calves and pigs 
make head cheese. 

The Livers of pigs, poultry, calves, beef, sheep, are all excellent, except perhaps that 
of beef is lacking in delicacy. Liver should be free from streaks or lumps and smooth 
in appearance. Lambs' liver is more toothsome and delicate, by the way, than calves' 
liver, and costs less.

PRINCIPLES OF COOKERY OF MEATS 

1. Heat Hardens Protein — Sear meat to retain 
juices. Cook slowly to make tender. Extract albu- 
men by soaking in cold water. 

2. Heat Decomposes Fat — Cook fata at a low 
temperature (bacon, pork chops). Remove fat 
from pan as fast as it fries out of the meat. 

Methods of Cooking Meats 

1 . To extract the juices, as in soups, broths and 
beef teas. 

2. To retain the juices, as in broiling, roasting, 
boiling and frying. 

3. Combination of both, as in stewing and 
braising v/here part of the juices are retained and 
part extracted. 

Beef tea, beef juice and beef extract are some 
of the products made from beef, having more or 
less food value, according to the method of prep- 
aration. Beef juice is the fluid portion of the 
muscle fiber, obtained by pressure, usually, and 
may be concentrated by evaporation at a tem- 
perature below the coagulating point of the soluble 
proteins. 

Meat extract is made by extracting the juice 
of meat by boiling water and then concentrating 
by evaporation. Beef extract was at one time 
highly recommended by Ltebig, who said it had 
great nutritive value because it contained much 
nitrogen in a form readily absorbed from the 



digestive tract. Later he said: "It does not give 
us strength, but makes us aware of our strength." 
In other words, it is a stimulant rather than having 
any great food value. Sherman tells of a series 
of experiments performed by Grindley, and says 
that never were they able to obtain n>ore than 
1 3 per cent, of the true protein of the meat in 
the broth, even when made under very careful 
conditions, and the average was only 7 per cent.

ECONOMICAL USE OF MEAT IN THE HOME 

From Farmers' Bulletin 391, U. S. Department of Agriculture (Extracts) 

Value of Meat sis Food — Considering the fact that meat forms an impor- 
tant part of the diet, and the further fact thnt the price of meat, as of other foods, has 
advanced in recent years, it is natural for housekeepers to seek more economical 
methods of preparing meat for the table, and to turn their thoughts toward the 
less expensive cuts and ask what economy is involved in their use, how^ they 
may be prepared, and whether the less expensive dishes are as nutritious and as 
thoroughly and easily digested as the costlier ones. 

The value of meat as food depends chiefly on the presence of two classes of nutrients: 
(I) Protein or nitrogenous compounds, and (2) fat. The mineral matter it contains, par- 
ticularly the phosphorus compounds, is also of much importance, though it is small in quan- 
tity. Protein is essential for the construction and maintenance of the body, and both protein 
and fat yield energy for muscular power and for keeping up the temperature of the body. 
Fat is especially important as a source of energy. It is possible to combine the fat and pro- 
tein of animal foods so as to meet the requirements of the body with such materials only, 
and this is done in the Arctic regions, where vegetable food is lacking; but it is in gen- 
erally considered that diet is better and more wholesome when, in addition to animal foods, 
such as meat, which is rich in proteins and fats, it contains vegetable foods, which are richest 
in sugar, starch and other carbohydrates. Both animal and vegetable foods supply the 
mineral substances which are essential to bodily growth and development. In meat min- 
eral matter constitutes about 0.3 to 1.9 per cent on an average of the total fresh material. 

The difference between cuts is chiefly in the amount of the fat and consequently 
in the fuel value. So far as the proteins are concerned, i. e., the substances which build and 
repair the important tissues of the body, very little difference is found. For all practical 
every-day purposes it may be considered that the protein obtained from a given weight of 
meat differs very little either with the kind of meat or the cut. The fattest portions of 
pork, which are used for salt pork or cured pork and bacon, are exceptions, and in such cuts 
the proteins may be as low as 8 or 9 per cent. 



APPARENT AND ACTUAL COST OF MEAT IN DIFFERENT CUTS 

The relative retail prices of the various cuts usually bear a direct relation to the 
favor with which they are regarded by the majority of persons, the juicy tender cuts of good 
flavor selling for the higher prices. When porterhouse steak sells for 23 cents a pound, it 
may be assumed that round steak w^ould ordinarily sell for about I 3 cents, and chuck ribs, 
one of the best cuts of the forequarter, for I cents. This makes it appear that the chuck 
ribs are less than half as expensive as porterhouse steak and two-thirds as expensive as the 
round. But apparent economy is not always real economy, and in this case the bones in the 
three cuts should be taken into account. Of the chuck ribs, more than one-half is bone or 
other materials usually classed under the head of "waste" or "refuse." Of the round, one- 
twelfth is waste, and of the porterhouse one-eighth. In buying the chuck, then, the house- 
wife gets, at the prices assumed, less than one-half pound of food for ten cents, making the 
net price of the edible portion 22 cents a poand; in buying round, she gets eleven-twelfths 
of a pound for fifteen cents, making the net value about l6)/2 cents; in buying porterhouse, 
she gets seven-eighths of a pound for 23 cen's, making the net value about 281/2 cents a 

130 



CLASS 2— MEATS— ECONOMICAL USE 131 

pound. The relative prices, therefore, of the edible portions are 22, 16!/2, and l&Yz cents; 
or, to put it in a different way, a dollar at the prices assumed will buy 4'/2 pounds of solid 
meat from the cut known as chuck, 6 pounds of such meat from the round and only 3^/2 
pounds of such meat from the porterhouse. To this should be added the fact that because 
of the way in which porterhouse is usually cooked no nutriment is obtained from the bone, 
while by the long, slow process by which the cheaper cuts, except when they are broiled or 
fried, are prepared the gelatin, fat and flavoring material of the bone are extracted. Tlie 
bones of meats that are cooked in water, therefore, are in a sense not all refuse, for they con- 
tain some food which may be secured by proper cookery. 

It is true, of course, that the bones of steaks may be used for soup-making, and that 
the nourishment may thus be utilized, but this must be done by a separate process from 
that of cooking the steak itself. 

LESSENING THE AMOUNT OF MEAT USED. 

In many American families meat is eaten two or three times a day; in such cases the 
simplest way of reducing the meat bill would very likely be to cut down the amount used, 
either by serving it less often or by using less at a time. Deficiency of protein need not be 
feared when one good meat dish a day is served, especially if such nitrogenous materials as 
eggs, milk, cheese and beans are used instead. In localities where fish can be obtained 
fresh and cheap, it might well be more cheaply substituted for meat for the sake of variety 
as well as economy. Ingenious cooks have many ways of "extending the flavor" of meat, 
that is, of combining a small quantity with other materials to make a large dish, as in meat 
pies, stews and similar dishes. 

THE FAT, BONE AND TRIMMINGS IN MEAT, AND THE LEFT-OVER COLD MEATS 

In the percentage of the fat present in different kinds and cuts of meat, a greater 
difference exists than in the percentage of proteins. If the fat of the meat is not eaten at 
the table, and is not utilized otherwise, a pecuniary loss results. If butter is the fat used in 
making crusts for meat pies, and in preparing the cheaper cuts, there is little economy in- 
volved; the fats from other meat should therefore be saved, as they may be used in place 
of butter in such cases, as well as in preparing many other foods. The fat from sausage 
or from the soup kettle, or from a pot roast, which is savory because it has been cooked with 
vegetables, is particularly acceptable. Sometimes savory vegetables, onion, or sweet herbs 
are added to fat when it is tried out to give it flavor. 

Some illustrations of methods of preparing such cooking fats follow: 

Ti"ying-Out Fat — A double boiler is the best utensil to use in trying-out small por- 
tions of fat. There is no danger of burning the fat and the odor is much less noticeable than 
if it is heated in a dish set directly over the fire. I 

Clarifying Fat. — Excepting where the purpose of clarifying fat is to remove flavor, a 
good method to follow is to pour boiling water over the fat, to boil thoroughly, and then to 
set it away to cool. The cold fat may be removed in a solid cake and any impurities cling- 
ing to it may be scraped off, as they will be found at the bottom of the layer. By repeating 
this process two or three times a cake of clean, white fat may be obtained. 

A slight burned taste or similar objectionable flavor often can be removed from fat 
by means of potatoes. After melting the fat, put into it thick slices of raw potatoes; heat 
gradually. When the fat ceases to bubble and the potatoes are brown, strain through a 
cloth placed in a wire strainer. 



i 32 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Sec. IV— Pt. 2— COOKING AND RECIPES 

Savory Drippings — When rendering the drippings of fat meat, add a small onion (do 
not cut it), a few leaves of summer savory and thyme, a teaspoonful of salt, and a little 
pepper. This is enough for a pint of fat. Keep the drippings covered and in a cool place. 

Uses for Bones — Almost any meat bones can be used in soup making, and if the 
meat is not all removed from them the soup is better. But some bones, especially the rib 
bones, if they have a little meat left on them, can be grilled or roasted into very palat- 
able dishes. The "sparerib" of Southern cooks is made of the rib bones from a roast of 
pork, and makes a favorite dish when well browned. The braised ribs of beef often served 
in high-class restaurants are made from the bones cut from rib roasts. In this connection 
it may be noted that many of the dishes popular in good hotels are made of portions of 
meat such as are frequently thrown away in private houses, but which with proper cooking 
and seasoning make attractive dishes and give most acceptable variety to the menu. An 
old recipe for "broiled bones" directs that the bones (beef ribs or sirloin bones on which 
the meat is not left too thick in any part) be sprinkled with salt and pepper (Cayenne), and 
broiled over a clear fire until browned. Another example of the use of bones is boiled mar- 
row bone. The bones are cut in convenient lengths, the ends covered with a little piece of 
dough over which a floured cloth is tied, and cooked in boiling water for two hours. After 
removing the cloth and dough, the bones are placed upright on toast and served. Pre- 
pared as above, the bones may also be baked in a deep dish. Marrow is sometimes re- 
moved from bones after cooking, seasoned, and served on toast. 

Trimmings from meat may be utilized in various "made dishes," or they can always 
be put to good use in the soup kettle. It is surprising how many economies may be practiced 
in such ways and also in the table use of left-over portions of cooked meat if attention is 
given to the matter. 

METHODS OF EXTENDING THE FLAVOR OF MEAT 

Common household methods of extending the meat flavor through a considerable 
quantity of material which ■would otherwise be lacking in distinctive taste are to serve the 
meat with dumplings, generally in the dish with it, to combine the meat with crusts, as in 
meat pies or meat rolls, or to serve the meat on toast and biscuits. Borders of rice, 
hominy, or mashed potatoes are examples of the same principles applied in different ways. 
By serving some preparation of flour, rice, hominy, or other food rich in starch with the 
meat we get a dish which in itself approaches nearer to the balanced ration than meat 
alone, and one in which the meat flavor is extended through a large amount of the material. 



IN PLACE OF MEAT 

You Eat in Order to Keep Yourself Alive 

(Reprint from publication, "Substitutes for Meat," issued by Mayor Mitchell's Committee 

on Food Supply, New York) 

The work you do, the exercise you take, the thoughts you think, each 
breath you draw — all these use up a certain portion of your body each day. If 
you want to live and keep well, this used up portion must be replaced, and this 
is done through the food you eat. Part of your food furnishes you with new 
blood; part of it goes to make bone; part of it builds up new tissue, or flesh. 

Meat has always been considered the best tissue or flesh building food, 
and for this reason people have always eaten it a great deal. Most of our meat 
has come from the Western States, but the tremendously large ranches of twenty 
years ago are greatly being cut up into small farms and cattle are not being raised 
in such large numbers any more, and this is one reason why meat costs so much. 
Another reason is the great demand there is for it on the part of the people who 
do not know that there are other foods that will supply the needs of the body in 
just the same way that meat does and which do not cost as much as meat. For 
instance, we can use fish in place of meat much more than we do. 

Other foods that can take the place of meat are eggs, milk, creamed soups, macaroni, 
cheese, cereals, nuts, bananas, peas, beans and lentils. 

Eggs contain all the elements, in the right proportion, necessary for the support of 
the body. They are rich in the same flesh-building element as the lean of meat and therefore 
make an excellent substitute for meat. They should be eaten with foods that are rich in 
starch, such as bread and potatoes, and if so eaten they will take care of the body practi- 
cally as meat would. 

Milk contains heat giving, strength giving and tissue building properties. Creamed 
soups and purees made with milk and the pulp of vegetables can take the place of meat. 

Macaroni, Spaghetti and noodles contain so much starch and flesh building material 
that they are equal to meat as a food if combined with cheese. The fat that they lack is 
supplied by the cheese, and when so combined they make a perfect food. 

Cheese contains in a condensed form the same flesh building material as meat and 
can be used in place of it. If combined with macaroni, rice, etc., it will supply all the needs 
of the body. Cheese costs less than most cuts of meat and a given amount of money will 
buy twice as much food value if spent for cheese as it will if spent for beef. 

Cereals contain in varying proportions all the elements necessary to support life. 
They contain a great deal of starch, which is valuable as a strength giver. Oatmeal and corn- 
meal contain more fat than the other cereals and therefore make a good winter food, especially 
for hard-working people. Cereals with cooked fruits are very appetizing. A bowl of oat- 
meal, eaten for breakfast, will furnish the average man with all the strength, heat and energy 
he will need; it is not necessary for him to eat meat in addition. 

Nuts contain in condensed form the same flesh building material as meat. Some of 
them contain a great deal of fat as well. They should not be eaten between meals, but raw 
or cooked they can take the place of meat. A pound of shelled almonds is equal in food 
value to three pounds of steak. Hickory nuts and pecans added to muffins or yeast breads 
may be used as a substitute for meat. Peanuts are also rich in food and flesh building 
material.

1 34 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Sec. IV— Pt. 2— COOKING AND RECIPES 

Bananas contain most of the nourishment that meat does, and if eaten with bread 
and butter make an excellent lunch without the addition of meat. Most children prefer banana 
sandwiches to meat sandwiches, and they cost much less. 

Peas, Beans, LentQs are richer in flesh building material than any other vegetables 
and can be used in place of meat. Lentils are more easily digested than either peas or 
beans. If properly prepared, all these make very appetizing dishes. A dish of baked beans, 
costing about fourteen cents, will furnish a family of six with more nourishment than two 
pounds of beef costing forty-four cents. 

In Stating that the various dishes given in this book can be used in place of meat 
it is not our purpose to urge one to give up eating meat altogether. It is a fact, however, 
that as a people we eat too much meat and we would undoubtedly find much benefit physi- 
cally if we cut down the amount of meat we eat, and varied our diet more than we do. 

We do not have to eat meat in order to keep well and strong. A great many people 
never eat meat at all, but find many foods of the strength-giving properties they require. 

If our meat supply continues to dwindle in the future as it has in the past meat will 
some day be very scarce and sooner or later we will have to learn to use other foods in 
place of meat.

SKIM-MILK VERSUS BEEF 

Skim-Milk is a very economical food material and might well be more 
largely used for human food — this in spite of the fact that it is nine-tenths water. 
The experts in the United States Department of Agriculture strongly urge a wider 
use of skim-milk for food. It carries an argument for economy, based on the 
price at which it is usually sold and the composition of the nutritive tenth of its 
contents. 

Whole Milk is an indispensable food for the young, and even in the diet 
of the adult it is comparatively economical. The only nourishing material taken 
from it in skimming is the butter fat. There is left, therefore, in the skim-milk, 
not only all of the sugar, which amounts to about four and a half parts in every 
hundred, and all of the mineral substances, but also all of the protein. The last 
named substance is important because, besides serving as food for the body as 
fats, sugars and starches do, it also supplies tissue-building material. The pro- 
portion of protein in skim-milk, as well as of the mineral constituents, which are 
also valuable for body building, is even greater in whole milk. 

Skim-Milk is to be classed, as whole milk is, with such food materials as 
eggs, meat, fish, poultry and cheese (though it is much more delicate than those 
foods) rather than with such substances as sugar, which serve only as fuel. Two 
and a half quarts of skim-milk contain almost as much protein and yield about the 
same amount of energy as a pound of round of beef. 

When skim-milk sells for four cents a quart, or about two cents a pound, 
and round of beef for twenty cents a pound, a dime or any other sum of money 
spent for skim-milk will provide nearly twice as much nourishment as it will if 
spent for round steak. 



INSTEAD OF MEAT 

(U. S. Food Administration Bulletin Food Leaflet No. 8) 
CHEESE, MILK, EGGS, BEANS, PEAS, NUTS, CEREALS 

These make appetizing dishes to take the place of meat. Why not use 
them oftener? There are plenty of good ways of cooking them. 

They give you a body-building material, the protein, and they give a lot 

of it. 

The child to grow must have food that furnishes this kind of material. 
You need it too. Even if you are grown up, you must have it to renew parts of 
your body used up by work and exercise. 

Don't think you have to eat meat to get this protein. TTiese other foods 
have it, too. Take cottage cheese, for example. It is richer in this material than 
meat. You can eat a third of a cup of it with pleasure, and this third of a cup 
will give you as much of the protein as a quarter of a pound of sirloin steak — 
a good, generous serving. Or if you like baked beans, eat a cupful to give you 
the same amount of protein. 

PEAS, BEANS, PEANUTS, CEREALS 

These are cheaper than meats and good. They should be used, but eat 
some milk or cheese besides. 

CHEESE, MILK, EGGS, MEAT 

These give body-building material in a little better form than the plant 
foods do. 

Cheese is a Fine Meat-Saver. There is a great deal of food in a little piece 
of it. Don't eat it at the end of a meal when you have already had enough. You 
would not eat a piece of meat then. An inch cube of American cheese cont£uns 
a third more protein than the same sized piece of lean meat. Cheese is excellent 
food if eaten at the right time. 

Get the Farmers' Bulletin on Cheese, No. 487, to learn how to use it in 
many ways. 

USE THESE GOOD MEAT-SAVERS 

Cottage Cheese is a delicious and easy dish. You can buy it from alniost 
any milkman or you can make it yourself. Add salt and pepper before eating, 
and if you prefer it more moist, stir in a little milk. It is good, too, served with 
applebutter, or a bit of jelly. While this is more of a dessert, it can still lessen 
the amount of meat you eat. 

To make cottage cheese, warm sour milk, whole or skimmed, on the back 
of the stove, or put a bowl of it in a pan of hot, not boiling, water for about 20 
minutes. Stir occasionally. When the curd and whey have separated, pour off 
the whey through a sieve. Work the curd with a spoon and let it drain. When 
fairly dry work again until smooth. The whey is good to use in making bread. 

Nuts are concentrated foods, too. Twenty single peanuts are about the 
same as the inch cube of cheese. Remember that nuts are good food. Chew 
them thoroughly or grind them up for a cooked dish and eat them as an important 
part of your meal.

Tender cuts of meat are best broiled, roasted or baked to keep in the juices 
and develop the flavor. The tougher cuts are more nutritious if cooked properly. 
They should be braised, boiled, stewed, or treated to tender in a dressing of olive 
oil, onion juice, lemon parsley, bay leaf, for from 1 hour to 1 2 or 24 hours. 



Pot Roast (Boiled Beef) — Select about 4 Iba. 
from rump, round, or brisket. Wipe meat, brown 
quickly in hot tried-out beef suet. Add boiling 
water to half cover. Bring to boil, cover pot, 
simmer 15 minutes to each pound till very tender. 
After first half-hour, add salt and pepper. 

For pot roast with onions, fry 1 large sliced 
onion I minute in hot suet, remove, sear meat 
in suet, put onions on top meat, add, sliced, 1 
turnip, I carrot, cupful canned tomatoes, salt, 
pepper, water to cover vegetables. Close pot 
tight, simmer 2 hours. When meat is tender, 
remove, skim, press gravy through colander, 
thicken and season — pour some hot over roast, 
serve rest of gravy separate. 

Roast Beef — A rolled roast has ribs removed, 
meat rolled and tied. A standing roast has ribs 
left in. 

Wipe meat with damp cloth or scrape. Do not 
w^ash. Do not salt until partly done. Sear out- 
side quickly with a dash of boiling water or in hot 
oven. Then low^er gas and cook for a rare roast 
10 minutes to each lb., basting every 15 minutes 
with meat juice, water, or cook in a sclf-basting 
roaster. 1 5 minutes before roast is done, dredge 
with butter, flour, salt and pepper. Use the juice 
from meat plain for gravy. Garnish vfith horse- 
radish, parsley and Yorkshire pudding. 

Make the pudding 20 minutes before roast is 
done. Mix 1 j/2 cups flour, j/^ teasp. salt, I teasp. 
baking powder. Beat 2 eggs, add with 1 l/i cups 
milk to the flour, beat. Pour into a hot pan 
greased with beef drippings. When batter is 
about to brown, baste with hot drippings. Brown, 
cut into squares, serve with roast. 

Beef a la Mode — Take several lbs. from under 
part of the round. Wipe, spread w^ith lemon 
juice and oil. Put in ice box several hours. Re- 
move, make sharp incisions through the meat, 
stuff with a mixture of seasoned bread crumbs, 
minced fat pork. Lay strips of fat pork on top. 
dredge with flour, tie to keep in shape. Cover 
meat in pot with minced I onion, carrot, turnip, 
few mixed herbs. Simmer tight closed about 4 
hours. Skim fat from gravy, reason, thicken, stir, 
serve on roast. 



Braised Beef — This may be cooked without 
w^ater in a baking dish on a bed of vegetables. 
Partly cook 2 large onions sliced in fat. On these 
lay small pieces of I carrot. I turnip, 3 stalks 
celery, salt, pepper, small bag of 6 mixed spices. 
Dredge 2 lb. piece of meat with flour, place it 
on top of vegetables. Cover. Cook slowly as 
possible 2 hours. 

When time to remove the meat, and vegetables, 
they w^ill have made a gravy of their ow^n juices. 
Serve these around the meat on a hot platter. 

Baked Heart — Cut away tough veins from a 
calf's heart, wash, soak in salted water J/2 hour. 
Stuff with forcemeat made of I cup soaked stale 
bread or bread crumbs, 1 cup chopped salt pork. 
'/2 teasp. salt, pepper, I tbsp. melted butter or 
drippings, chopped half onion, 2 tbsp. w^ater; I 
egg beaten into forcemeat improves it. Stuff the 
heart, bake in slow^ oven, baste often w^ith beef 
stock or hot water and drippings. Serve in its 
own gravy. Garnish w^ith pickled beets, sprigs of 
parsley or watercress. 

Braised Beef Tongue — Take a fresh tongue and 
boil; that is, w^ipe, cover in pot with boiling w^ater, 
simmer 2 hours. Remove skin and roots when 
done. Place in braising pan with 2 tbsp. each 
diced carrot, onion, celery, I teasp. parsley. Half 
cover with water tongue was boiled in. 

Cook 2 hours. Make a sauce of the gravy by 
adding 2 tbsp. butter rolled in 1 tbsp. flour sea- 
soned with !/2 cup tomato juice, salt, paprika, J/^ 
teasp. Worcestershire sauce. 

Pour sauce around tongue on hot platter and 
serve. Mushrooms with a little lemon juice added 
to sauce improves its flavor. 

Beefsteak Broiled — Wipe and trim steak, place 
on a greased hot broiler under a flame. Sear all 
surfaces by turning several times for first niinute. 
Cook a thick steak 6 minutes to be rare, 8 min- 
utes well done. Dish up on hot platter. Sprinkle 
w^ith salt, pepper and butter. Serve at once ao, 
or with a prepared mushroom or brown sauce. 

Smothered Beef with Macaroni — Cut 2 lbs. 
meat into neat pieces, sear on all sides in hot fat, 
dredge with flour, cover with boiling w^ater, sim- 
mer until nearly done in closed pot. Then add

I Mutton and LdTn6 




rMiiiiiiiiiiiiiiir;iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiniiiiiiiiiiiiiiiir? 
MUTTON AND ITS VALUE IN THE DIET 

(From U. S. Farmers' Bulletin, No. 526) 

Mutton has from early times been a popular food both in the Orient and 
among western nations. TTie ease with which the sheep is raised and the fact 
that its flesh is not, like some other meats, excluded on religious grounds from 
the dietary of any large group of people, combine with its palatability to bring it 
into widespread favor. The terms "lamb" and "mutton" are somewhat loosely 
used to designate the meat obtained from the younger and older animals. In 
some localities mutton is used to apply to the flesh of all but young lambs; in others 
its use is limited to the flesh of full-grown sheep. The latter is perhaps the common- 
est usage in the United States. 

The general belief that mutton and lamb are wholesome has been strength- 
ened recently by such work as that of the United States Department of Agri- 
culture whose reports of meat inspection show that it has been necessary to reject 
relatively few mutton carcasses as unfit for food, and that the sheep is particularly 
free from diseases which render meat undesirable. 



COMPOSITION AND NUTRITIVE VALUE 

The term "mutton" is here used to apply to 
the flesh of a sheep one year or more old. Such 
meat differs in composition from the flesh of a 
lamh very much as meat of any other mature 
animal differs from that of a young animal of the 
same kind, as beef differs fron> veal, for example, 
or fowl from chicken, i.e., it has, in general, a 
smaller percentage of water and larger percen- 
tages of fat, protein, and extractives or flavoring 
substances. Pound for pound, mutton has a 
larger amount of tissue-forming substances and a 
higher energy value than lamb. 

So far as nutritive value is concerned, mutton 
is usually classed with beef. Analyses show that 
they have nearly the same composition. The per- 
centage of waste differs very slightly in the two, 
being on the average a little less than 20 per 
cent, in each. In the edible portion the percen- 
tage of protein is practically the same; it aver- 
ages about 18 per cent, in the beef and 16 per 
cent, in the mutton. It is only when the fat is 
considered that any considerable difference is 
noted. This averages about 20 per cent, of the 
edible portion in medium fat beef and a little over 
30 per cent, in the corresponding kind of mutton. 
As might be expected, water is correspondingly 
low in the mutton and high in the beef, being 



about six-tenths, or 60 per cent., of the total in 
the beef and about live-tenths, or 50 per cent., 
of the total in the mutton. Because of the larger 
amount of fat, the fuel or energy value is greater 
in mutton than in beef, being usually stated as 
1,500 calories per pound, while that of beef is 
given as about 1,145 calories. The fact should 
be kept in mind, however, that these figures refer 
to the average of many samples of the two kinds 
of meat. The variations in different samples of 
either meat are wider than the differences between 
these average values, and for this reason the cus- 
tom of classing beef and mutton together when 
their nutritive values are concerned may be con- 
sidered fair. 

RELATIVE ECONOMY IN THE USE OF 
MUTTON 

While mutton and beef do not differ materially 
in percentage composition or digestibility, mutton 
has an advantage in that it is capable of some- 
what more economical use. The mutton carcass, 
unlike the beef carcass, is of such size that a 
quarter or a half, either of which supplies a 
variety of cuts, can be conveniently utilized in a 
household of moderate size with ordinary refrig- 
erating facilities, and the price per pound is com- 
monly less when the meat is bought in this way. 
There is a certain advantage, too, in the fact that 



141 



1 42 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Sec. IV— Pt. 2— COOKING AND RECIPES 



the leg, which has the smallest percentage of 
waste of any of the cuts of mutton, is of suitable 
size for family use, for a piece of meat which 
has not been cut up keeps better than one which 
has been cut. On the other hand, the rather gen- 
eral belief, which, however, seems unfounded, that 
all kinds of mutton fat are unsuitable for culinary 
purposes, has tended somewhat to an uneconomi- 
cal use of this meat. 

CARE OF MUTTON IN THE HOME 

Because of the facility with which mutton ab- 
sorbs odors and flavors, special care should be 
taken of it in the home. When it comes into the 
house, it should be wiped thoroughly with a damp 
cloth, and all portions that have the slightest un- 
pleasant odor about them should be cut off. Such 
portions are most likely to be found where the 
layer of meat is thin, as, for example, on the 
lower end of the leg, on the flank, or on the 
ribs. When a large piece of mutton is bought, 
these facts should be kept in mind in determining 
which parts should be used first. It is well, for 
example, to remove the flank end of the loin and 



part of the rib bones first, and use them for soups 
or stews. The removal of the membrane and the 
red skin from the surface of the meat before it 
is cooked is also desirable. In roasting mutton, 
many housekeepers believe that it is well to keep 
the meat well up from the pan by means of a 
rack, for if this is not done, the fat of the meat 
is likely to become scorched and to affect the 
flavor of the meat itself. 

JUDGING MUTTON 

There are a number of points which should 
be borne in mind when purchasing mutton for the 
table. The lean portion of the meat should be 
firm, finely grained, and of a deep red color. The 
fat should be well distributed. The leg should 
be nearly covered with a layer of fat and there 
should also be a thick layer over the back. This 
outside layer is often in the trade referred to as 
the "covering." The fat itself should be white, 
hard, brittle, and flaky. The "mottling" of the 
flesh with fat, which is so important a sign of 
good quality in beef, is considered of less im- 
portance in judging mutton. 



RECIPES 



Boiled Leg of Mutton — Select leg weighing 6 
or 8 lbs. with fat white and flaky. Trim, wipe 
off, put on in boiling water, boil until scum rises, 
skim, simmer until tender. Season with 1 teasp. 
salt, when nearly done, serve with caper sauce. 
The water left may be used for soup, or to season 
meat dishes made from cold mutton. 

Roast Shoulder of Mutton — Have butcher re- 
move bone and trim, put these in cold water, and 
make stock for soup or to baste roast. Stuff 
shoulder with a mixture of I cup bread crumbs, 
I tbsp. melted butter, 2 tbsp. boiling water, Yi 
teasp. grated onion, '/i teasp. salt, pepper. Add 
a few chopped mushrooms if convenient. Sew 
or skewer to keep dressing in. Place in hot oven 
with I cup water in roasting pan. Baste often. 
In half-hour reduce heat, cook 2 hours. Plain 
mutton gravy should never be served. Use a 
meat sauce. Garnish daintily with mushrooms or 
parsley or forcemeat balls. Serve dinner vege- 
tables of tomatoes, string beans, green peas, or 
young turnips Pass current jelly. 

Leg of Lamb Roasted — 1. Plain — If leg of Iamb 
is not prepared in the market for roasting, peel

cloth. If a self-basting roasting pan is used 
sprinkle meat and pan with salt, pepper, and 
flour. Put in hot oven. When flour is browned 
fill bottom of roaster with water. Cover, cook 
rapidly 30 minutes, more slowly for I hour longer.

VEIAL is not as easily digested as beef and is less nutritious, but because 
of its tenderness, the contrary is often thought the case. 

For determining quality of good veal, see article on "Choosing Meats," 
under section on MEATS. 

If one can purchase the entire fore-quarter of veal he may secure it at a 
very low price; the breast, though delicious vi^hen stuffed and breiised, is little 
known and demanded. The fore-quarter contains the ribs, corresponding to the 
rib roast of beef, and from these are cut the best chops, the entire rack of veal, 
as the chops are known, makes a roasting equalled only by the loin and the fillet. 
The neck of the veal cuts into excellent breakfast cutlets. The flesh portion of 
the foreleg, or shin, make pot pies or stews, and the leg itself makes soup or stock. 



RECIPES 



Plain Roast Veal — Use either the ribs or a leg. 
Trim and wipe, sear all sides quickly in a hot 
roaster. Add I cup boiling water to pan. Cover, 
roast at the rate of 20 minutes to each lb., basting 
every 1 5 minutes. Add water to keep pan from 
getting dry. The last 40 minutes salt and pepper 
the meat, dust with flour, put in around it peeled 
halved sweet potatoes. When about done remove 
cover, brown meat and potatoes. 

Shoulder of Veal — This is roasted in the same 
manner except that the bone is removed care- 
fully without breaking the outer skin and a force- 
meat is put in the bone cavity. This stuffing may 
be of onions, sliced, seasoned, and an equal quantity 
of bread crumbs, or chopped ham and bread crumbs 
with salt and pepper or tomato seasoning. Bake 
the meat until the gravy shows no red color. Take 
up the meat. Thicken liquid in pan with I tbsp. 
flour; ^vhen it is browned add boiling water, salt 
and pepper, stir until smooth. Serve this gravy 
with the shoulder of veal and potatoes that have 
been either baked brown with the meat or roasted 
in their jackets. 

Filet of Vesd — Stuff the hole from which the 
bone is taken with a forcemeat of ^/i cup salt 
pork, chopped, I cup minced ham, 1 cup bread 
crunibs, I tbsp. salt, I/2 teasp. pepper, 1 teasp. 
lemon juice, parsley, 2 tbsp. gravy or fat. Skevi'er 
the filet round. Brown surface in hot oven, salt 
and pepper, lay thin slices of salt pork on top. 
Baste with water. Roast in moderate oven sev- 
eral hours. When done remove slices of pork, 
dredge with flour and brown uncovered. While 
roast is browning slice tomatoes, salt and flour 
them, fry quickly in hot lard or cottolen-?. 



Make gravy of I cup meat gravy, I cup tomato 
puree. Garnish roast with fried tomato slices and 
serve at once, and send in tomato puree gravy 
seasoned with few drops of tobasco or tomato 
catsup. 

VeeJ Loaf — This may be made as beef loaf, or 
use 3 or 4 lbs. of meat, Yi of which is veal, J4 
beef, I/4 salt pork. Chop all line, mix with I 
minced onion, 1 tbsp. lemon juice, ! tbsp. salt, 
Y2 teasp. pepper, 3 tbsp. crumbs, I egg, 4 tbsp. 
cream or gravy. Shape into oblong loaf, bake 
slowly about 2 hours, baste every 1 5 minutes. 
Carve loaf at table; serve thin slices with thick 
tomato sauce or catsup; or spinach and rice; or 
mashed sweet potatoes and gravy. 

VeeJ Pot Pie Take 2 cups cooked veal chopped 

or sliced thin, I onion, and I potato, diced, I cup 
fat pork minced, Yl teasp. salt, few grains cay- 
enne. Moisten well with gravy, add extra cupful. 
Simmer in deep meat pie pan 5 minutes. Cover 
with a rich biscuit dough crust, perforated. Bake 
in moderate oven 40 minutes. 

If crust is not desired cover meat with boiled 
rice seasoned, pour over it 1 cup tomato juice, 
garnish with halves of hard boiled eggs half im- 
bedded in the rice. Dot with butter and crumbs. 
Bake 30 minutes. Serve in baking dish. 

Veal Breast Breast of veal may be boned and 

stuffed; or spread on one side with a forcemeat, 
rolled loosely ever and tied; or put meat in a 
roaster with pork strips laid over and under it, 
add I cup boiling water, cook until half done, then 
spread with 2 chopped onions, parsley, 1 chopped 
green pepper, 2 cups peeled and sliced tomatoes.

Finish cooking covered. Lift cover and brown 
meat, take vegetables out with strainer and serve 
around the meat with plain boiled rice in a sep- 
arate dish. 

The tomatoes in the spread may be omitted, 
and when cover is hfted to brown meat drain out 
the gravy, and cover veal with mashed sweet po- 
tatoes. These will brown on top. Lift meat with 
potatoes to hot platter. Serve with spinach. 

Gelatine of Veal — Gelatine is meat boned, 
stuffed, rolled, boiled and served cold. A breast 
may be used. Spread with a rich, well seasoned 
forcemeat, roll, tie up in cheesecloth. In a pot

Instead of breast take a knuckle of veal. Boil 
tender, mince the meat, add it to the juice, pour it 
into a mold. While cooling add slices of hard 
boiled egg. Serve cold from the ice box. 

Veal Cutlets, Breaded — Be sure to cook veal 
thoroughly, as it is neither wholesome nor 
palatable if underdone. Bread the cutlets with 
line breadcrumbs, salt and pepper, dip in beaten 
egg, then crumbs. If not firm, set on ice until 
fat is ready, smoking hot. Drop cutlets in, turn 
within 5 minutes, then cook more slowly so that 
the outside will not get too brown before inside 
is done. Drain off fat, serve at once, in hot dish. 
Sprinkle horse-radish on each cutlet, or serve 
with tomato sauce, or corn muffins and apple 
sauce. 

Veal Shortcake Make a dough of 2 cups flour, 

2 teasp. baking powder, !/2 teasp. salt, 2 tbsp. 
lard, I cup milk. Roll thin, cut into 2 squares.

POULTRY includes turkey, chicken, duck, etc. — generally domestic fowl. 
The meat of poultry is not so nutritious as beef and mutton, but its tenderness and 
flavor render it most agreeable as a change in the usual bill of fare. 



SELECTING POULTRY 

When selecting a chicken in the average market you cannot always know the history 
of its breeding and feeding though you may look instinctively for the plump breast, rounded 
legs and well-meated back of the fine, well-fed bird. You can tell by other signs whether 
it has been handled from the barnyard to the market in the sanitary and skillful manner 
which keeps a good chicken sweet, fresh and tender; that is, whether it has been properly 
killed and well bled, chilled, dry-picked and carefully packed in cartons under refrigeration. 

Always ask for the dry-picked chicken; select a short, plump, fat one, if possible. 
Its skin should be soft, loose, dry and unbroken, and the breast fat yellow. Scalding a 
chicken for picking removes much of the nutriment, affects the flavor, adds water to its 
weight, and makes it less liable to keep well. Avoid a bird with tightly drawn, shiny skin 
and legs that are difficult to draw back. 

If the dry-picked fowl you have selected has been properly bled and air-chilled it 
will be of an even yellow or white color over the entire body, not with discolored neck 
or red blotches on the wings and hips. 

The carton-packed are placed in small groups in boxes, their heads wrapped in 
parchment paper. They are not packed with ice in a barrel. 

These special signs indicate the sanitary treatment of the chickens. To judge age, you 
must know that an old hen or cock has a coarse head, rough skin, rough shanks and feet, 
heavy, blunted toe-nails, rigid breast-bone and long hairs, no pin-feathers. If carefully 
cooked they are suitable for chicken-pie, the casserole and the fricassee. 

The youth and tenderness of a chicken are indicated by a small comb, smooth 
shanks, soft, thin skin, easily bent breast-bone and the presence of pin-feathers. 

Choose spring chicks for broiling; a fairly young, plump one for roasting. 

A young turkey should have plump, pliable breast-bone, smooth, dark legs, very short 
spurs. 

Young ducks and geese not more than a year old have firm, plump breasts, the fat 
is soft and white, the wings tender and the skin between the toes tender. 

Young pigeons have tender, pink legs and light red flesh on breast; on old ones 
it is very dark. Squabs are young tame pigeons; they are very large, but are soft and 
plump covered with pin-feathers. 

Grouse, partridge and quail should have plump breasts, dark legs and yellowish bills. 

Chicken offers 20 per cent of protein, 8 per cent of fat and 850 heat units per 
pound and compares favorably with sirloin steak in the amount of digestible nutrients fur- 
nished.

152 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Sec. IV— Pt. 2— COOKING AND RECIPES 



TO DRESS AND 

Remove pin feathers, singe off all hairs. Slit 
akin down the back of neck, cut neck ofl even 
with body, cut skin of the leg below knee-joint, 
lightly, without cutting the tendons, break the 
bone with a sharp rap and pull off the foot. 

Make an incision from end of breast bone to 
tail. Hold the fowl steady, reach carefully into 
the body, loosening membranes and removing the 
intestines without breaking them. Cut out of this 
mass the giblets, which are the heart, gizzard and 
liver, being careful not to break the green gall- 
bag near the liver. Put aside the giblets, neck 
and feet for soup or gravy. 

Through the necle opening remove the wind- 
pipe and glands. Allow cold water to run through 
the fowl, wash it quickly and thoroughly inside 
and out. Wipe dry and truss. 

To StuEf a Fowl, force the dressing through the 
opening below the breast bone and the one near 
the neck. If stuffed too tight, bread dressing will 
be soggy and crackers will swell and crack the 
skin. 

To Truss — Bend the wings close to the body 
and turn under; push thighs up against the 
breast. Fold the skin over front incision and 
neck. Skewer the wings, thighs and skin into 
place, or sew, or tie with twine. 

When a fowl is dressed, cleaned, trussed and 
stuffed it is ready for roasting or boiling. 



CLEAN POULTRY 

To Prepare for Broiling — Singe, wipe, cut down 
from neck along the back bone, open, remove 
insides, wash, wipe dry, skewer wings and thighs 
close to body. If preferred, cut out the ribs and 
remove breastbone. 

To Cut Up for frying, fricassee or boiling: clean 
and dress; separate legs from body by cutting 
skin and flesh at base of leg and disjoint. Cut 
flesh and disjoint upper leg or second joint from 
lower or drum stick. Cut wings off in same 
manner. Beginning two inches below breastbone 
make an incision following a line belov/ ribs to 
collarbone; disjoint. Slice off the wishbone piece 
from the breast. Divide breastbone. Cut the 
back in two pieces. 

To Prepare Giblets — Use only healthy looking 
giblets. The liver should be light in color. Care- 
fully cut away from it the green gall bladder with- 
out breaking. Remove membranes and blood 
from the heart, leaving only the fleshy part. Re- 
move fat from gizzard, cut open, peel off the out- 
side muscle from the inside skin. Wash giblets, 
place in cold water. Cook until tender, mines 
fine and add to the gravy. When cooked with 
neck and wing-tips there is enough stock for 
gravy. 

The legs of a young fowl make as nutritious 
jelly as calves' feet. Scald legs until the skin 
and claws will peel off. Place legs in cold salted 
water and simmer until flesh falls from bones. 



POULTRY RECIPES 



Boiled Chicken — An old fowl will do for boil- 
ing. Clean according to directions; rub inside 
and out with lemon juice to make the meat white, 
juicy and tender. It may be stuffed with a poultry 
dressing or boiled plain. To have it ke»p its 
shape, tie up close in a cheese cloth. Plunge in 
boiling water to nearly cover. Simmer gently, 20 
minutes to the pound. The last hour add salt and 
tie up in cheese cloth bag '/2 cup washed rice. 
The bag must be large enough to allow for rice to 
swell. Put in with chicken. When done, lift 
chicken out of bag to hot platter, garnish with a 
border of drained rice. Pour over it some 
oyster or celery sauce, or make a dressing of 
parsley, celery, hard boiled eggs chopped and 
added to a pint of skimmed gravy from the boiling 
pot. 

Roast Chicken — Prepare a 3 to 5 lb. chicken 
for cooking, rinse inside with cold soda and water, 
wipe, rub with salt and pepper and lemon, stuff 
with a dry dressing of I cup dry bread crumbs, 
2 tbsp. butter, Ya teasp. salt. '/8 teasp. pepper. 
If onion flavor is liked, brown one small onion 
minced in the butter before stirring in the crumbs, 
add minced parsley if desired, or sage. Wet 



dressing is made by moistening with I /3 cup milk. 
When chicken is stuffed, rub over the breast and 
legs a paste of flour and butter and dust bottom 
of pan with flour. Place in hot oven. When flour 
is brown, baste with 2 tbsp. butter in J/2 cup 
hot water. Lower oven heat, cover tight, roast I 5 
minutes to each lb. If water dries out in pan, 
baste with more. Serve with a gravy made of 
the thickened chicken broth and the giblets chopped 
fine. 

If a roasting pan is used it is not necessary 
to put it in the oven. A delicious roast is the 
result if the meat or fowl is put in roaster with 
some water and seasonings and set on top of the 
stove. It should steam slowly until tender. If 
needed, add a little water but uncover as little 
as possible. The meat when done will be juicy 
and well flavored; make gravy with the juice. 

Broiled Chicken — Prepare a very young one, 
split it down back, wipe inside and out, sprinkle 
with salt, pepper and salad oil. Place on broiler 
with inside uppermost under flame, until nearly 
brown. Broil 12 minutes to the lb., turning often. 
Serve breast up on hot platter with drawn butter 
sauce poured over. Carnish with parsley or water- 
cress.

fat, place in casserole and pour over it all a 
thick rich gravy made with what was left in brown- 
ing pan. If needed, add more water to cover, sea- 
son, simmer till tender in moderate oven. If a 
more savory fricassee is wanted, pack in the cas- 
serole in layers with the chicken either ( I ) a 
mixture of ^ cup minced ham, 1 pimiento. J/2 
teasp. sage, J/2 teasp. summer savory, J^ teasp. 
curry powder, pepper and salt: or (2) a vege- 
table fricassee of 2 celery stalks, 6 button onions,

gristle. Chop the meat and season. Skim fat 
from broth, return meat to it, heat, turn into a 
bowl. Press a platter down on the meat with a 
heavy weight. When cold, this should turn out 
as a mold of jelly and cut in smooth, even slices.

pimientoes cut in fancy shapes. Sprinkle with 
finely shredded green peppers or parsley. Pour 
rest of stock on slowly so as to harden. When 
this has jellied add a layer of chicken, then one 
of veal. Spread on a thin layer of butter, then 
oiled paper. Put a plate with a weight on top. 
When on ice 3 hours turn the jellied loaf out 
and serve. 

Chicken Pie (with Forcemeat Balls) — Cut up a 
chicken and boil covered according to directions. 
When it begins to be tender remove and place at 
once in a baking pan. Lay the pieces on top of 2 
thin slices of fried pork with 1 dozen marble- 
sized forcemeat balls and 1 cup hot water. Cover 
the top with a thin biscuit dough. Lightly brown 
the crust in hot oven, lower heat, cover with thick

Under this head is included all wild animals and wild fowl used for food. 
In cooking either, apply the same general rules already given for meats and poul- 
try, remembering that all white meated game should be cooked well done; dark 
meated game rare, and both must be sent to the table very hot, with hot plates. 
Wild meat contains a much greater percentage of phosphates, and much more 
lean than fat, while the lean is of much greater density than the flesh of domes- 
ticated animals. It follows that they are a strong food, and, if well digested, very 
nutritious. 

When game is kept many days it should be drawn, the inside rubbed with 
salt and pepper, and it does no harm to put some lumps of charcoal in the cavity. 
If there is any objection to washing, it must be very carefully drawn and then 
wiped with a damp cloth until perfectly clean. Neither salt nor pepper should 
touch the outside of the meat until it is cooked. 

Simplicity is the highest perfection in cooking, especially of game, and all 
seasoning, sauces and accompaniments should be subordinate to the flavor of the 
meat. 

RECIPES 



Roast Veniton — Venison, the meat of deer, 
should be cooked rare and served very hot. It 
will be too dry if not covered thoroughly with butter 
and basted often with hot water and butter, or 
larded with strips of pork. Put the larded leg 
or saddle of venison in a covered roaster with a 
little water. Cook 20 minutes to each lb., bast- 
ing every 1 5 minutes. Half hour before it should 
bo done baste with claret or melted currant jelly. 
Make a gravy with the drippings seasoned. Pour 
into gravy boat, serve some tart jelly with the 
roast. 

Loin haunch or leg may be roasted in the same 
way. 

When the roast is to be reheated, slice it and 
heat in a brown sauce, or curry, or olive sauce, 
or serve cold with mustard sauce. 

Venison Steak — Cut steak f^ inch thick, rub 
with oil and lemon juice, set aside I hour, then 
broil as beefsteak. Sprinkle with salt, paprika. 
Serve at once with wild plum or crabapple jelly, 
or Maitre d'Hotel sauce. 

Roast Rabbit or Hare — These are fall and early 
winter game. Select a young one with soft paws 
and hairs not stiff. Have the butcher skin the 
hare, which was drav^^n supposedly soon after it 
was killed. Wash carefully, stuff with a dressing 
as for chicken with minced pork added. Sew up. 
truss the legs. Put in roasting pan and lay sliced 



pork over it. Bake I hour in hot oven, turn 
and baste often with boiling water and butter. 
Before basting the last time, dredge with flour and 
brown. Thicken the gravy and add 1 tbsp. tomate 
catsup or Worcestershire sauce. 

Hare en Casserole — I. Cut up the prepared hara 
as for fricassee, roll in flour, brown well in hot 
pork fat or bacon grease. Arrange these pieces 
in hot casserole on a layer of sliced onions lightly 
fried. Add parboiled potatoes sliced. Pour over 
all a brown mushroom sauce. Simmer until ten- 
der from I to 2 hours: add I tbsp. lemon juice, 
4 tbsp. sherry, and serve. 

2. Pour over the browned pieces of rabbit in 
casserole a curry sauce, or Spanish sauce, or rich 
brown stock. Cover tight, simmer I to 2 hours. 
If brown stock is used, add to the casserole just 
before serving 2 tbsp. tart jelly; serve with boiled 
rice. 

Squirrel or Rabbit Pie — Brown the pieces of 
squirrel in bacon fat, season with I teasp. salt, 
pepper, I sliced onion, 3 lemon slices, I tbsp. 
butter or minced pork. Cover with boiling water; 
put on a tight cover and stew slowly I hour or

Wild Ducks — These should be carefully picked, 
singed, washed outside, drawn and wiped inside 
with a cloth w^et in soda and w^ater. 

For a casserole cut the birds up neatly. Split 
them dow^n the back for broiling or smothering. 
Leave them whole for roasting and truss with the 
neck twisted down to cover the opening in breast, 
the tail turned down to close opening through 
which it was drawn. Season with salt and pepper. 
Cook rare 20 to 30 minutes. 

If stuffing is used, select either a dry bread 
dressing, or oysters rolled in egg and dry bread 
crumbs toasted in butter, or chopped onion, cel- 
ery, and crumbs. All wild birds may be pre- 
pared in about the same ways. 

Broiled Quail — Pick, singe, draw and cut off 
heads and feet of 6 quail. Wipe out with a wet 
cloth, split down the back, spread inside and out 
with oil, pepper and salt, broil on both sides 1 5 
or 20 minutes. Baste w^ith the oil and drippings 
if the birds seem to get dry before they are done. 
Serve plain on buttered toast, or with a spoonful 
each of hot bread sauce topped w^ith crisp fried 
bread crumbs. 

Smothered Prairie Chicken — Prepare as quail 
for broiling. Brown lightly in hot skillet, then 
arrange in a steaming pan with tight cover. 



Steam very slowly 30 minutes. Remove cover and 
pour over birds 1 cup Maitre d'Hotel sauce. Serve 
with fried hominy, green peas and tart jelly. 

Broiled Squab Split down back and spread 

flat ; season with salt and pepper, broil until 
done. Lay each squab on a square of toast and 
pour over it Maitre d'Hotel sauce. 

Roast Grouse When ready for roasting, truss 

and stuff if desired with an oyster dressing to 
which finely minced fat pork has been added or 
a seasoned bread crumb dressing, or spread in- 
side of the birds with butter, tie slices of fat pork 
on the back and thighs, as the grouse is a dry 
meat bird. Place in a covered roaster with 1 cup 
boiling water, roast 45 minutes. Brown and 
serve with jelly sauce. 

Pigeon Pie The birds may be floured as for 

roasting and browned quickly in butter, spread 
inside with salt, pepper and butter, and spread 
outside with a forcemeat of veal and ham ground 
and mashed w^ith yolks of hard-boiled eggs. Ar- 
range in a deep pie dish with a very little w^ater. 
Fill in between the birds with the remaining force- 
meat made into tiny balls. Bake covered until 
nearly done, then pour in a drawn butter sauce. 
Cover with a thin pie crust with a slit in the center. 
Cook until crust is done and brown.

Fish is an important part of our food supply. Fresh fish is less stimulating 
and nourishing than meat, but is considered more easily digested. Fish makes an 
agreeable change in the usual routine of a roast, broil, fry and boil. A notable 
advantage is the short time required to cook fish; another is the great variety of 
kinds through the long list of fresh and salt water, red or white fleshed, dry, salt 
or fresh. The white fleshed fish is more easily digested than the red fleshed. 
Examples are w^hitefish, haddock, cod, flounder, perch, pickerel, crappies, etc. 
Elxamples of red fleshed fish are salmon, shad, lake trout, etc. Very large fish 
are, as a rule, better when boiled or steamed; medium sized ones should be baked 
or split and broiled, and small ones fried. Red fleshed fish, being richer in fat, 
should not be fried. 

A fish is in good condition when the eyes are bright, the gills a bright clear 
red, scales shiny, the flesh firm and free from a disagreeable odor. 

Mayor Mitchell's Food Committee on Fish 

The habit of eating fish on Friday only is absurd, and should be stopped. 
Fish are just as appetizing and nourishing on Tuesday and Thursday as on Fri- 
day, and if you and your neighbors will buy fish any day in the week you v^ill get 
cheaper fish and better fish. Hundreds of carloads of fish are sent from New York 
to other cities because the people of New York do not appreciate the value of fish 
as a food and do not buy it as often as they should. 

Vary your diet as much as you can. You will be more healthy if you do. Don't 
use meat so much. Use fish more. Fish is just as nourishing as lean meat and if eaten with 
bread, potatoes, etc., will supply all the needs of the body. If possible, buy your fish 
from a fish dealer. 

VVhen you buy fish see that you get the trimmings. You are just as much entitled 
to them as you are to the trimmings of your meat. 

The meat part of almost any fish may be cooked separately. If you ask your fish 
dealer to remove the meat part of the fish for you, the trimmings will consist of the head, 
the skeleton and the fins, and these can be used for fish stock out of which can be made 
excellent fish soups and fish sauces. 

Halibut costs from fifteen to twenty-two cents a pound. Market cod costs about 
five cents less a pound, and can be cooked in the same way as halibut. It can be cut u' 
into steaks; it can be boiled; the tail can be split and broiled in the same way that you would 
broil mackerel or bluefish, and it costs about eight cents less a pound than either mackerel or 
bluefish. i 

Haddock costs about five cents to eight cents less a pound than halibut and can be 
cooked in the same way. Both cod and haddock are in season all the year and if properly 
cooked are extremely appetizing. 

When you buy bluefish get a large sized fish; it costs about five cents a pound less 
than a medium sized one, and if you buy a large one you will have enough left over for 

159 



1 60 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Sec. IV— Pt. 2— COOKING AND RECIPES 

another meal. Any fish left over can be used to make fish cakes or can be creamed and 
put into a dish and baked. 

Many People go to a fish store and buy the fillets of a fish instead of buying the 
whole fish. A fillet of fish is nothing more or less than the meat of the fish stripped from 
the skeleton. Some fish dealers have these fillets all ready on a platter for sale, but if you 
buy them that way you will pay anywhere from five to twenty cents more a pound iot 
them than if you buy the entire fish and ask the dealer to strip the fillets off for you and 
give you the trimmings. 



HOW TO TELL WHEN FISH IS FRESH 

In fresh fish the eyes are bright, the gills red, and the flesh firm and odorless. Put 
fish in water, and if it sinks you will know it is fresh. If it floats, it is a sign it is not fresh, 
and it should not be used. Serious illness is apt to follow the eating of fish that is not fresh. 

Cleaning Fish — Be sure that your fish is thoroughly cleaned before cooking. It should 
be clecined as soon as it is bought. 

Fish in Season — Cod, scrod, haddock and chicken halibut can be obtained prac- 
tically all the year. (Scrod is young cod split down the back and the backbone removed 
except a small portion near the tail. Chicken halibut is the kind usually found in the 
markets. ) 

Flounders are not so good in November, December and January. 

Smelts are in season from June to March. 

Mackerel is in season from May to September. 

Shad is in season from January to Juae. 

Salmon is in season from May to September, but it can be obtained the greater part 
of the year. 

Bluefish are in season from May to October. As it is frozen and kept in cold 
storage from six to nine months it may be obtained practically the year round. 



THE TUNA FISH 



It is surprising that more are not familiar with the tuna fish. It provides a most 
satisfactory fish dinner at a moment's notice, and it is a veritable delicacy that every house- 
wife should keep in stock. 

The meat of the tuna fish is pure and white, greatly resembling lobster meat and, 
to many, much like it in flavor. In Norway it is much preferred to fillet of sole. But its 
greatest advantage lies in its adaptability. It may be broiled and used with toast, it makes 
a most tempting sandwich, with crisp lettuce, and for a fish salad no other fish can rival it. 

The commercial tuna is a small fish found off the coast of Alaska and California 
and off Finland and Norway. We get most of it from California. 

It is one of the nourishing foods. Like the salmon, it is a fat fish, and supplies 
many calories, or units of body fuel. The salmon has 9.5 per cent of fat and the tuna 9.1 
per cent. The salmon's calories, or food value per pound, is 685. The tuna's, 669. 

The tuna may be served cold, as an hors d'oeuvre, or it may be broiled emd spread 
on toast, like anchovy paste, as a relish. But, best of all, it may be taken solid from the 
can, thoroughly heated, garnished with dabs of butter and bits of bacon, and served as the 
chief dish for a Friday dinner. 

The meat of the tinned tuna fish is so white and solid that it lends itself admirably 
to all sorts of treatment for serving, even for frying. 



CLASS 9— FISH— PREPARATION 



161 



THE PREPARATION OF FISH 



White fleshed fish are best broiled or planked, larger white fleshed fish are 
best boiled and served with sauce Hollandaise or Maitre d'Hotel butter (as bass, 
cod, halibut, red snapper, haddock) , as they need the addition of some form of fat 
to give flavor and nutriment. Small fish (as brook trout, smelts, etc.) are best 
fried. Halibut slices may be dipped in egg and bread crumbs and fried in fat. 

DIRECTIONS 



To Clean a Fish — Remove the scales by scrap- 
ing with a dull knife from the tail toward the 
head. Head and tail may be left on or removed 
according to the manner of cooking. Small fish 
to be served whole have the entrails removed by 
opening under the gills and pressing out their 
contents with the thumb and finger; example, 
smelts. Larger fish are split half-way down the 
belly and the insides scraped and washed with 
salt and water after it is empty. Wipe the fish 
inside and out with a cloth wrung out in cold 
salted water, then wipe with a dry, clean cloth. 

To Skin a Fish — First remove the fins along the 
back and cut off a narrow strip of skin the en- 
tire length of the back. Loosen the skin over the 
bony parts of the gills and slowly work toward 
the tail. Do the same on the other side. 

To Bone a Fish Clean fish and remove head; 

beginning at the tail, run sharp knife close to the 
backbone, cutting the meat away on one side and 
working toward the head. Turn and repeat on 
the other side. 

Boiled Fish Clean the fish according to the 

directions, wipe carefully and rub with salt. 
Wrap in a piece of cheesecloth to hold the fish 
together and to prevent the scum from adhering 
to the fish. Place it in a kettle half filled with 
boiling water, cook slowly, allowing fifteen or 
twenty minutes to the pound. A long fish-kettle 
with a rack is useful. A wire basket in a kettle 
may be substituted, the fish coiled about in the 
basket. The water in which the fish cooks should 
have salt and vinegar or lemon juice added, 2 
teasp. of salt and I of vinegar to a qt. of water. 
The salt gives flavor, the vinegar or lemon juice 
keeps the fish white. The fish is cooked when 
flesh is firm and separates easily from the bone. 
Take from the water and remove cheesecloth. 
Garnish with parsley and slices of lemon. 

Steamed Fish — Clean carefully but without re- 
moving head or fins; rub inside and out with salt 
and pepper and lemon juice, laying slices of onion 
inside if liked. Lay on a buttered paper and 
steam till the fish falls easily from the bones. Lay 
on a folded napkin, garnish with lemon and 
parsley and serve with a Hollandaise sauce. 



Baked Fish — Clean, wipe and dry the fish; rub 
with salt inside and out; stuff and sew; cut gashes 
two inches apart on each side so they will alter- 
nate and skewer into the shape of an S or an O. 
Put the fish on a greased baking sheet, or if this 
fish sheet is not at hand place strips of cotton 
cloth under the fish by which it may be lifted 
from the pan. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and 
place narrow strips of pork lardoons in the gashes. 
Place in a hot oven without water; baste with hot 
water and butter as soon as it begins to brown 
and repeat every ten minutes afterwards. For a 
four-pound fish the time would be an hour. Re- 
move to a hot platter; draw out the string; wipe 
off all water or fat which remains from the fish, 
remove pieces of pork. Garnish the head of fish 
with parsley or watercress. 

Stuffing for Baked Fish — 1. One cup cracker 
crumbs, '/^ teasp. salt, J/g teasp. pepper, I teasp. 
chopped onions, I teasp. chopped parsley, I teasp. 
capers, I teasp. chopped pickles, 3 tbsp. melted 
butter; this is sufficient for a fish weighing 4 to 6 
pounds. 

2. I cup bread crumbs, I tbsp, minced onion, 
2 tbsp. butter, I teasp. chopped parsley, |/^ teasp. 
salt, J/g teasp. pepper, I egg. Soak bread in cold 
water; when soft, press out all the water; fry 
onion in butter, add the bread, parsley and sea- 
soning. Add the beaten egg at last. 

3. Yi cup lean veal, J/g lb. fat bacon, '/^ cup 
bread crumbs, Ya teasp. salt, J.'g teasp. pepper, I 
teasp. onion, I teasp. parsley. Chop the meat 
very fine, add the bread crumbs soaked and 
pressed and the seasonings. 

Broiled Fish — Large fish should be split through 
the back to broil, head and tail are usually re- 
moved. Salmon, halibut and sword fish are cut 
in inch slices for broiling. Smelts and other small 
fish are broiled whole. Clean and wipe fish as 
dry as possible, sprinkle with salt and pepper, 
place in a well-greased broiler. Broil the flesh 
side first till almost done, then cook on the skin 
side just long enough to brown well. Small fish 
require from 5 to 6 minutes, thick ones from 20 
to 30 minutes. To remove from the broiler, 
loosen one side from the wires first, turn and 



1 62 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Sec. IV— Pt. 2— COOKING AND RECIPES 



loosen on the other side, then slip from broiler to 
hot platter. Spread with butter and set in warm- 
ing oven to let it penetrate the fish. 

To broil fish in a gas stove, clean and dry as 
usual, only it is better to remove the backbone. 
Put under the flames an iron or granite baking 
dish well greased. Place the fish on this, skin 
down, sprinkle with salt and pepper, dot with 
butter and dredge w^ith flour. When nicely 
browned reduce heat; time required, from 25 to 
30 minutes. 

Fried Fish — Wipe the fish dry, sprinkle with 
salt, then dip in flour or crumbs, then dip in egg, 
and again in flour or crumbs, and fry in deep fat. 

Panned Fish — This is suitable for any small fish 
or such as can be cut in slices. Have the fish well 
cleaned, seasoned w^ith pepper and salt and dried 
with a little flour; or, better still, very fine bread 
crumbs. Have a large frying pan smoking hot 



with as little grease in it as will keep the fish from 
sticking. Dripping from good sw^eet pork is the 
best, but any sweet drippings will do. When the 
fat begins to smoke blue, lay in the fish and 
brow^n quickly on both sides, then cover closely 
and set back to cook more slowly, from 1 to 20 
minutes, according to the size of the fish. Bass 
in all its varieties is suitable to cook in this way; 
so are butterfish, cisco (lake herring), herring, 
perch, porgies, trout, weakfish, etc. 

Saute Fish — Prepare your fish as for frying and 
cook in frying pan with small amount of fat. Cod 
steaks and smelts should be cooked in this w^ay. 

Salt Fish — Very salt fish should be cooked sev- 
eral hours in 3 or 4 changes of w^arm water. 
Place the skin side up, so that salt crystals may 
fall away from the under side or meat side. Wipe 
carefully and clean, then soak an hour in very 
cold water.

Boiled Salmon Trout — Clean a small salmon, 
sew up in cheesecloth, place in kettle with boiling 
salted water to cover. Add a tbsp. vinegar. Cook 
slowly, 20 to 30 minutes. Remove cheesecloth, 
slide fish to a hot platter. Pour over it a white 
cream sauce with egg. or a cream sauce with peas. 
Garnish with parsley and lemon slices. 

Planked Shad — While the plank is heating un- 
der the oven flame, wash, split and dry a 3 lb. 
shad, sprinkle with salt, pepper, few drops of 
olive oil, lay skin down on hot plank, cook quickly 
20 minutes. During that time boil white potatoes 
until mealy, drain, add butter, salt and rich milk; 
beat until smooth and stiff enough to stand alone. 
Drop spoonfuls of the potato on the plank around 
the shad. Put where the potatoes will brown, 
spread over the fish a dressing of melted butter 
and lemon juice. Serve. 

Shad Roe This may be broiled, fried, baked or 

creamed. Wipe roe with wet cloth, dry, sprinkle 
with salt and pepper. Broil 5 minutes on greased 
wire broiler under flame, turn, and while the roe 
is cooking on the other side, place thin slices of 
bacon on top. Both roe and bacon will be done 
at the same time. Serve at once with lemon 
slices. 

To Fry Roll in flour, egg, bread crumbs, fry 

in deep fat, serve with Maitre d'Hotel butter 
sauce. 

To Boil — Cook in gently boiling water 1 min- 
utes, serve with tomato sauce. 

Creamed (Baked) — Crumble 2 boiled shad 
roes with a fork, stir lightly into a plain cream 
sauce, season with salt and pepper. Mix in the 
chopped whites of 2 hard-boiled eggs, turn into 
a glass baking dish. Crumble the hard-boiled 
yolks on top. Place in hot oven for a few min- 
utes before serving. 

Boiled Filet of Flounder — Filet the fish: that is, 
take backbone out and cut each half in about 2 
neat long slices. Wipe these, season with salt, 
lemon juice and oil. Roll each slice up with 
skin side inside: pin with a toothpick; put on ice 
1 5 minutes to stiffen. Arrange filets in pan, add 
I cup water, I tbsp. butter, simmer 1 5 minutes, 
then lift them out with a flat wire spoon, lay on 
buttered toast and pour over them a thrck cream 
sauce cooked with chopped parsley. 

Fish Kedgeree — Hard boil 2 eggs, wash 1 cup 
rice, boil until tender, drain; mix 2 cups of cooked 
fish flaked with the rice and sliced egg wKite.s. 
Turn into a hot pan with 2 tbsp. butter. Season 
and stir until hot all through. Serve quickly on 
a hot dish, garnish with parsley and grated egg 
yolks. Canned tuna fish is nice prepared in this 
way. 



Tuna Fith with Mayonnaise — Canned tuna fish 
is usually too rich to serve cold unless rinsed in 
boiling water to remove some of the fat. TTjen 
chill it in the whole piece. At the same time 
marinade on ice in spiced vinegar, I can of as- 
paragus tips and J/2 can stringed beans in sep- 
arate dishes. At serving time dish the whole piece 
of tuna fish on a platter, cover with stiff mayon- 
naise, garnish with the asparagus tips and string 
beans. 

Fried Tuna Fish — To fry tuna, wipe it as thor- 
oughly dry as possible without breaking and pre- 
pare fat for immersion. Do not use the old fry- 
pan method. Beef fat is good because it does 
not leave the fish greasy, or some of the modern 
prepared cooking fats of today are even better. 
Do not get the fat smoky. Prepare a lot of very 
fine bread crumbs, beat eggs without separating 
yolks and whites, and brush this over the fish. 
Sprinkle with the bread crumbs and place in a 
wire basket. Throw a few bread crumbs in the 
fat and if they brown in thirty seconds the fat is 
just right. Immerse the fish in the fat by means 
of the wire basket and when they are browned 
and crisped outside, remove and drain in a warm 
place. Serve the fish on a folded napkin on a 
platter garnished with lemon and parsley. 

Tuna in the Can — If you heat the tuna fish in 
the can an excellent sauce for serving with it is 
made of 2 cups of milk, 2 cups of water, 3 tbsp. 
butter, 3 tbsp. flour, '/g teasp. pepper and Yi 
teasp. salt. First put 3 teasp. butter in a sauce- 
pan and cook the flour in it, then add the boiling 
liquid, the remainder of the butter, bit by bit, and 
the seasoning. Boil 6 minutes. 

Tuna Mors d'Oeuvres — As an hors d"oeuvre a 
tuna fish meat may be served by cutting into 
tempting little bits the solid white meat, thoroughly 
chilled, and with it serve a generous slice of 
lemon. Sprinkle paprika on the meat and garnish 
with parsley. 

Tuna Paste A paste may be made of tuna meat 

by mincing it thoroughly and forcing it through 
coarse cheesecloth. Lightly brown a narrow slice 
of bread. With the tuna meat paste mix paprika 
and enough salt to make it more than ordinarily 
salty. Spread this thinly on the toasted bread and 
hold again over the hot coals of the gas flame un- 
til the fish paste has browned. Serve hot for a 
relish. If you cannot get sufficiently coarse 
cheesecloth, use a very fine sieve. Put only 
enough butter with this to moisten. Too much 
spoils the flavor. 

Tuna Filet — For a filet nothing is better than 
the tuna fish. Many people place it ahead of sole. 
Cut the meat in strips an inch wide, roll the strips 
over and fasten with a skewer. Immerse in hot 



1 64 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Sec. IV— Pt. 2— COOKING AND RECIPES 



fat or cooking oil as in frying. The tinned tuna 
fish need be in the oil no more than 3 minutes. 
Drain carefully and serve on a napkin, garnishing 
the filet with parsley and lemon. 

Canned Salmon (Baked) — Remove bones and 
skin from canned salmon, flake the fish and sim- 
mer in its own liquor. Mix I tbsp. butter, I tbsp. 
flour in I cup milk; add I tbsp. lemon juice, few 
grains cayenne; stir sauce into salmon with 2 
sliced hard-boiled eggs. This may be poured into 
a buttered baking dish, sprinkled with crumbs and 
browned in hot oven, or it may be spread in a 
casserole dish on a bed of boiled rice or thin 
sliced cooked potatoes. Cover with rice or pota- 
toes and steam 20 minutes. Serve with peas, or 
Hollandaise sauce. 

Creamed Salmon — Remove bits of skin and 
bones and flake the canned salmon; mix with 4 
finely chopped hard boiled eggs, 1 cup bread 
crumbs, 2 tbsp. melted butter, I cup milk, ^/i teasp. 



salt, dash of pepper. Heat slowly to boil, stirring 
often, then pour it over crisp buttered toast or 
puffed pastry browned. 

Sardines or tuna fish may be used instead of 
the salmon. 

Salt Codfish Balls — Soak I cup of shredded salt 
codfish in 2 cups water, 1 5 minutes, drain. Sim- 
mer with 2 cups sliced potatoes until they are 
tender, drain and mash. Beat in until thoroughly 
mixed, I beaten egg, 1 tbsp. butter, pepper, and 
salt if needed. Dip tablespoonfuls of the mixture 
in hot fat when brown, drain, serve. 

A quicker way when cold cooked potatoes are 
at hand is to mix mashed potatoes with the soaked 
codflsh, or canned salmon or any cold fish. Sea- 
son, moisten with I tbsp. warm milk, and I tbsp. 
melted butter stirred into an egg. Mold the mix- 
ture into balls, dip lightly in flour, fry in hot fat 
to cover, drain, serve at once on hot dish with

Eggs are such familiar every-day articles of food that hardly anybody con- 
siders it a problem to be able to cook them properly. Yet there are good and bad 
ways of preparing eggs. The egg is one of the most valuable of muscle-making 
foods and when properly cooked is easily digested. 

To Tell Fresh Eggs — If an egg is "strictly fresh" it will, when placed in a 
pan of water, lie on its side on the bottom. 

If stale, it will stand on end, and if very old will rise to the surface. 

When just a few days old the egg will begin to tilt a trifle, and as it ages 
more and more the angle at which it tilts will increase. 

In shaking an egg, if it makes a sound it is not good and should be re- 
jected. 

To keep yolks of raw eggs fresh for several days, drop unbroken into a 
bowl of cold water. 

When boiling eggs, wet the shells thoroughly with cold water before plac- 
ing them in boiling water, and they will not crack. 

Cracked eggs can be boiled by adding a teasp. salt to the water, and they 
will not lose any of the white or albumen. 



RECIPES 



Breakfast eggs should never be boiled. A thin 
shell of the white is made hard and indigestible 
while the bulk of the egg is barely warmed 
through. 

Boiled Eggs — For soft boiled eggs put 6 into 
a vessel that will hold 2 qts. Fill with boiling 
\vater, cover closely and set on the stove shelf 
for 6 to 8 minutes. For medium, 10 minutes; 
(or hard boiled, 40 to 45 minutes. 

Poached Eggs — Fill a shallow pan nearly full of 
salted boiling water. As soon as the water sim- 
mers, not boils, slip in the eggs one by one, from 
a dish into which they have previously been 
broken. Dip the water over them with a spoon, 
that the yolk may be cooked. When the white 
is firm and a film has formed over the yolk, take 
out each egg with a skimmer. Drain well, place 
on buttered toast, sprinkle with salt, pepper. 
Serve at once. 

Poached eggs may be done in milk, stock or 
gravy, which can be poured over the toast on 
which they are served. 

Griddled Eggs Heat the griddle almost as 

much as for baking cakes, butter it lightly and 
arrange small muffin rings on it. Drop an egg in 
each and turn as soon as lightly browned. They 
resemble fried eggs, but are far more delicate. 



Scrambled Eggs — Take small piece of butter 

and a little cream; warm in a frying pan. Break 

6 eggs in it and stir until slightly cooked. Serve 
hot. 

Fried Eggs Fried eggs may be done in butter, 

oil, or any sweet fat; the pan should hold enough 
fat to almost cover the eggs; the eggs should be 
slipped into the fat singly from a cup; dip the 
hot fat over them: do not let the fat get hot enough 
to "frizzle" the whites. Season with salt and pep- 
per. Serve at once. 

Plain Omelet — Break 4 eggs into a bowl, add 
i/2 teasp. salt, J/g teasp. pepper. Give several 
beats with a fork and add milk. Melt the butter 
in omelet pan, pour in the eggs, shake over a 
moderate fire until they are set. Roll and turn into 
hot dish. 

To make jelly, parsley, ham, cheese or chicken 
omelet, spread the seasoning over the eggs just 
before rolling them. 

A Secret with Omelets — In making omelets put 
the salt with the whites of the eggs instead of the 
yolk and the omelet will not fall, but will be dry 
and pufly. 

To Fold and Turn Omelets — Hold an omelet 
pan by the handle in the left hand; with a knife 



171 



1 72 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Sec. IV— Pt. 2— COOKING AND RECIPES 



make two inch cuts opposite each other at right 
angles to the handle; place knife under omelet 
nearest handle, tip pan slowly over a hot platter, 
pass knife under omelet slowly when the omelet 
will fold out. 

Light Omelet — For each egg allow 54 teasp. 
salt, a dash of pepper, I tbsp. of liquid (milk, 
cream, stock, tomato, etc.), break whites and yolks 
separately, beating each until very light. Add 
liquid and seasonings to yolks, fold the yolks into 
the whites, stirring as little as possible. Have the 
omelet pan hot, melt in it I teasp. butter, turn in 
the omelet and cook over a slow fire until well 
browned on the bottom, then set in the oven until 
the top is set. Fold carefully, not to break the 
crust, and turn into a hot dish. Serve at once. 

This omelet is delicious made with minced ham, 
green peas, I cup grated or chopped sweet corn 
or asparagus tips. The latter should be well 
cooked, drained, seasoned and spread on just be- 
fore folding the omelet. The ham may be folded 
in or mixed through the whole egg. 

Spanish Omelet — Cut 4 oz. bacon in thin slices, 
and then into half inch squares. Fry until crisp 
and add 1 small onion, I tomato chopped fine and 
5 mushrooms chopped fine. Cook for 15 minutes. 
Rub the spoon with a clove of garlic. Break 6 
eggs into a bowl, add Yi teasp. salt, '/g teasp. pep- 
per, give several strong strokes and turn into a 
buttered frying pan. Bake until nearly set. spread 
the bacon and vegetables quickly over, fold, set in 
oven for I minute, turn it upon a hot platter and 
serve with tomato sauce. 

Rice Omelet — Warm I cup milk in a double 
boiler, add I cup cold boiled rice, and I tbsp. 
butter, stir and beat till well blended: add 3 eggs 
well beaten, and Yi teasp. salt. Melt 1 tbsp. but- 
ter in omelet pan; when hot turn the rice mixture 
in and let it brown 1 minute; put in oven to set, 
fold and serve. 

Chicken Liver Omelet — Cook together I cup 
minced cooked liver and Yi cup Spanish sauce or 
brown gravy; add I teasp. vinegar. 1 tbsp. chopped 
mushrooms. Yl teasp. salt, few grains cayenne. 
Keep warm while preparing omelet; make the 
omelet following directions as given for light 
omelet. Just before folding spread with the liver 
mixture. Serve with brown sauce or tomato sauce. 

Omelet with Cheese — Beat 4 eggs very light, 
add Yl <:"P '"'"'• ' '=^'P- ''°'"' ^ ''"'* parsley, 
pepper and salt. Yl teacupful grated cheese. I 
tbsp. butter. Beat all well together and pour into 
well buttered pan. Let it cook till light brown: 
shake the pan while omelet is cooking. Serve at 
once. 

Omelet with Oysters — Blanch I dozen small Blue 
Point oysters by bringing them just to the boiling 



point in their own liquor, seasoned with a dash 
of cayenne. 1 saltsp. of salt, and a grate of nut- 
meg: mix an omelet, place over the fire, and 
when it begins to cook at the edges, place the 
oysters, without any liquor, in the center, fold 
together and serve at once. 

Eggs, Rice and Spinach — Boil and blanch a cup- 
ful of rice and heap it on the center of a platter. 
With the back of a spoon make places for as many 
eggs as you wish to serve. Break each egg care- 
fully into its place, and season. Place spinach, 
cooked and seasoned, around the edge of the rice. 
Bake until the eggs are as firm as you like them. 

Curried Eggs — Cook I teasp. chopped onion and 

3 tbsp. butter in small frying pan for 3 minutes: 
add I tbsp. flour and I teasp. curry powder: stir 
until it becomes smooth, then add I cup stock, 
Yl eup milk, or cream, salt and pepper to taste, 
and cook for 10 minutes. Quarter 6 hard-boiled 
eggs, place in a deep saucepan, strain the sauce 
over them, simmer for 3 minutes. Serve very hot 
with toast. 

The teasp. of curry powder gives a delicate 
flavor. More may be used if desired. 

Scalloped Eggs — Boil 8 eggs twenty minutes. 
Crumble about half of small loaf of bread. Put 

4 cups milk, 3 tbsp. butter and several sprigs of 
parsley in a pan and heat; when hot, thicken with 
a heaping tbsp. flour, salt and pepper to taste. 
Put into buttered baking dish first a layer of 
bread crumbs, then a layer of sliced eggs, a little 
pepper and salt, more butter, if desired: then a 
few tbsp. white sauce, and so on, vsrith a layer of 
bread crumbs on top. Bake 30 minutes. 

Deviled Eggs — Cut 4 hard-boiled eggs into 
halves, lengthwise; remove the yolks, being care- 
ful not to break the whites. Powder the yolks 
with a silver fork; then add I teasp. mustard. I 
teasp. salt, a dash of paprika and cayenne pepper

E FORCEMEATS, CROQUETTES AND FRITTERS i i 

iiiiiiiiiiiiiimiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiTiiiiiiiiiiiiriiiiiiiiii: 



Entrees are served before and after the heavy meat course. In such a place 
they are small and dainty, well flavored and often elaborately garnished. They 
may also serve as the main dish at family luncheons and suppers and frequently 
are the means of using to good advantage the left-overs of a previous meal. 

All the large variety of fritters, croquettes, souffles, timbales and aspics are 
listed as entrees. 

Material for entrees should be carefully prepared and well seasoned; the 
meat or fish should be chopped fine and all ingredients thoroughly mixed. 

Almost all entrees are served with an appropriate sauce and crisp bread. 
Patties should be served alone ; timbales usually with cream sauce and peas, mush- 
rooms or truffles; croquettes are usually served with peas. 

Forcemeat is used extensively in the making of garnishes and entrees. It 
consists of meat chopped fine, served separately or used as stuffing. 

Croquettes are well adapted for using any remnants of meat, fish or game 
and to make a savory dish from the more insipid vegetables. 

As meat and fish lose flavor in a second cooking, it is necessary to replenish 
this lack by using stock, cream or broth, either in the composition of the dish or 
as a sauce to serve with it. These sauces should be thoroughly cooked before the 
meat or fish is added; in order to avoid over-cooking of the protein substances. 



RECIPES 



Chicken Forcemeat — Chop, pound and rub 
through a sieve enough chicken meat to fill I cup. 
Boil together !/£ cup fine stale bread crumbs, J/2 
blade of mace, and 1 cup cream until they are 
cooked to a smooth paste, about 10 minutes; then 
take from the fire; add 3 tbsp. butter, then the 
meat, Yz tbsp. salt and J/g teasp. pepper. Beat 
whites of 3 eggs well and add to mixture. Test to 
make the texture right and set away to keep cool 
until wanted. 

Game and veal forcemeat are prepared in the 
same way. 

To test mixture, drop a small ball of it into a 
saucepan of boiling water and set back %vhere it 
will not boil; cook for about 10 minutes. If it 
cuts smooth and fine all through and is tender, it 
is just right; if it should be tough, add 2 tbsp. 
cream to each cup of forcemeat; if, on the con- 
trary, the forcemeat ball is too soft and shrinks 
when cut, add I well beaten egg to every pint of 
the forcemeat. 

Liver Forcemeat — Put goose liver in hot water 
15 minutes, drain and cook slowly in salted water 
for 25 minutes, pound and rub through a sieve. 
Cook I cup bread crumbs in chicken stock, add 



I teasp. salt, |/g teasp. pepper, blade of mace; com- 
bine with 3 cups liver, I cup butter, and 3 eggs 
^vell beaten; mix well together. 

Chicken, turkey or veal liver can be substituted. 

Oyster Forcemeat — Drain and wash I dozen 
large oysters, scald and strain the oyster liquor; 
chop the oysters very fine. Add 2 cups bread 
crumbs, 3 tbsp. butter, I teasp. salt, J/g teasp. 
pepper, I teasp. minced parsley, a grate of nutmeg, 

1 tbsp. lemon juice, 3 tbsp. oyster juice, and 2 
raw egg yolks; pound to a smooth paste and rub 
through a sieve. 

Chicken Quenelles Use !/2 calf's brains, clean, 

tie in a piece of cheesecloth, and cook slowly for 
half an hour in well-seasoned stock. Cool and 
pound smooth, add to I chicken breast also 
chopped and pounded, and rub both through a 
.sieve. Cook 2 tbsp. bread crumbs and '/4 cup cream 
together until a smooth panada, add the meat v^ith 

2 tbsp. butter, 1 teasp. salt, }/z teasp. lemon juice, 
grate of nutmeg, a few grains of pepper, and, 
lastly, I egg, and set away to cool. When ready 
to use, dip 2 teasp. in hot water, fill one spoon 
with the mixture and slip from one to the other 
until it is smooth and shaped like the bowl of the

spoon; slide on a buttered pan when all are formed, 
cover with boiling stock, and let cook belo>v the 
boiling point for 10 minutes, keeping the dish 
covered with buttered paper. 

Quenelles of Grouse — Use half an anchovy, chop 
and pound with 1 cup meat, minced fine, and Yl 
cup bread crumbs. Add Yl teasp. chopped pars- 
ley, 2 tbsp. butter, I egg, J/2 teasp, salt, J/^ teasp. 
pepper, Yl clove garlic, and Yi teasp. lemon juice. 
Mix altogether carefully, cool and shape in balls 
the size of an egg. They may be poached and 
served with a Bechamel sauce or fried and served 
with any good brown or mushroom sauce. 

Lobster Quenelles — Pound to a paste the meat 
and coral of a lobster; mix with it 2 tbsp. bread 
crumbs and 6 tbsp. butter; add Yl teasp. salt, Ya 
teasp. pepper, few grains cayenne, and nioisten 
with 2 egg yolks and I egg white; if it proves too 
soft when tasted, add another white of egg; if too 
stiff, work in a little water. Shape and poach. 
Serve with Tartar sauce. 

If served hot, the sauce should be Bechamel. 

These may be cooled after poaching, fried in 
butter and served as a garnish for steamed fish, 
or in soup. 

Croquettes — The excellence of croquettes de- 
pends upon three things: ( 1 ) The mixture must not 
be too thick. (2) It should be made some time 
before cooking, and, after rolling in eggs and fine 
crumbs, be set aside in a cold place to thicken. 
(3) The fat in which they are cooked must be 
boiling and deep enough to cover them. 

Eggs used for covering croquettes may be the 
whole egg or the whites only; never use the yolks 
alone. Beat the eggs until broken, not until light; 
add 1 tbsp. water for each white, or 2 tbsp. for 
a whole egg. Mix well before using. 

To Shape Croquettes — Take about a tbsp. of the 
mixture and with both hands shape in the form 
of a cylinder. Handle very gently and carefully. 
Pressure forces the particles apart, and thus breaks 
the form. Have a board sprinkled lightly with fine 
bread or cracker crumbs, and roll the croquettes 
very gently on this. The slightest pressure will 
break them, so let them lie on the board until all 
are finished, when, if any have become flattened, 
roll them into shape again. Beat an egg slightly 
and add I tbsp. water. Roll in egg and cracker 
crumbs and fry in deep fat a golden brown. 

Chicken Croquettes — Mix 2 cups of chopped 
cold fowl with Yl teasp. salt, few grains cayenne, 
I teasp. lemon juice, '/4 teasp. onion juice, I teasp. 
chopped parsley, and combine with I cup ^vhite 
sauce. Shape, crumb, and fry in deep fat. Drain 
on soft paper. 



Chicken and Cornmeal Croquettes (Farmers' 
Bulletin 565, on "Cornmeal," U. S. Dept. of Agri.) 
— I cup white corn-meal mush, 1 cup chopped 
chicken, few drops onion juice, 1 egg, salt and 
pepper. 

Combine the ingredients and drop by spoon- 
fuls into hot fat. 

White corn-meal may be combined very satis- 
factorily with other kinds of cold meat to make 
croquettes. In general, corn-meal croquettes need 
not be egged and crumbed like ordinary croquettes, 
for the hardening of the corn-meal on the surface 
of the mixture forms the necessary crust. 

This serves three people. 

Chicken Croquettes with Mushroom* — Chop I 
cup cold cooked chicken and Yl can mushrooms 
or 6 large oysters fine. Melt 2 tbsp. butter, add 
3 tbsp. flour, mixed with Yl teasp. salt, Y^ teasp. 
pepper, and I teasp. lemon juice; then add slowly 
Yl cup chicken stock and Y^ cup mushroom liquor. 
Cook until smooth and add Y^ cup cream. Com- 
bine with the meat and mushrooms. Cool, shape, 
and crumb. Fry in deep fat. Drain on brown 
paper. 

Royal Croquettes — Parboil I large sweetbread 
and 1 calf's brains; chop fine with meat of half 
a chicken; add one egg, well beaten. Melt Ya cup 
butter, add 3 tbsp. flour, mixed with 1 teasp. 
chopped parsley, 1 teasp. salt and '/^ teasp. pepper; 
add cream or milk a little at a time until 1 cup 
is used, and cook until smooth. Combine mixture 
with the sauce and set aside to cool. Shape and 
roll twice in egg and in cracker crumbs and fry 
in deep fat. Drain on brown paper. 

Calf's Brains Croquettes — Parboil I small sweet- 
bread and I pair calf's brains; chop very fine 
with 1 can mushrooms; add Yl cup boiled rice 
and white sauce. Cool and shape into small rolls. 
Roll in fine crumbs, egg and crumbs again, and 
fry in deep fat. Drain on brown paper and serve. 

Beef and Rice Croquettes — Mince the meat fine, 
but not to make it pasty; add an equal amount of 
hot, boiled rice, cooked much softer than it is 
usually served for a vegetable. Season highly with 
salt, pepper, cayenne and onion juice and set to 
cool. If it is too stiff, work in a little stock or 
gravy. Drain on brown paper. 

Sweetbread Croquettes — Mix I teasp. salt, '/g 
teasp. white pepper, a dust of nutmeg, Yl teasp. 
chopped parsley. 1 tbsp. lemon juice with 2 cups 
cooked and chopped sweetbreads and 4 tbsp. 
chopped mushrooms, and set aside to season while 
making a white sauce of 2 tbsp. butter, 2 tbsp. 
flour, and 1 cup cream. Add the meat to the sauce, 
and, lastly. 2 beaten eggs. Set av^ray to cool or 
stiffen for 2 or 3 hours, then shape, crumb, and 
fry. Serve with mushroom, white sauce, or 
Bechamel yellow sauce.

Cheese being rich in protein takes the place of meat so far aa the actual 
nourishment of the body goes. It has more fat than meat and 25 percent more 
muscle-building substances, but it should be remembered that so concentrated a 
food is not a well balanced diet when eaten alone. It is more easily digested when 
grated or melted with a pinch of soda added, or cooked with other foods. It should 
be accompanied by bread, vegetables or fruits for bulk, mineral salts, and water. 

Cheese should be kept covered in a cool place. Old cheese may be grated 
and kept in a cool dry place. 

CHEESE AND ITS USE IN THE DIET 

(U. S. Farmers' Bulletin 487) 

Cheese is believed to be the oldest of the dairy products and the first form in which 
milk was preserved for future use. One may conjecture that it owes its origin to the acci- 
dental storing and ripening of sour milk curd. Although it has been a staple food with 
many races for uncounted years, there is a widespread belief that it is suitable for use chiefly 
in small quantities as an accessory to the diet, and that in large quantities it is likely to pro- 
duce physiological disturbances. We are inclined, therefore, to think of those who make 
cheese one of the chief articles of their diet as being driven to this course by necessity 
rather than being led to it by choice. 

Because of these opinions extensive studies have been carried on as a part of the De- 
partment Work in Home Economics, of the food value, thoroughness of digestibility, ease 
of digestion, physiological effect, and special character of cheese as food as well as of meth*- 
ods which are followed in preparing it for the table. The conclusion drawn from this ex- 
tended study is, in brief, that cheese properly prepared and used is not generally a cause 
of physiological disturbances, and that it may easily be introduced into the bill of fare in 
such quantities as to serve as the chief source of nitrogenous food and may be made a sub- 
stitute for other nitrogenous foods when such substitution is desired. 

From the standpoint of the housekeeper, cheese is of importance because of its high 
nutritive value, particularly its high percentage of protein or muscle-forming materials, be- 
cause of the ease with which it can be kept and prepared for the table, and because of its 
appetizing flavor and of the great variety of ways in which it can be served. 



There ia something to be said of the value of 
cheese to that not inconsiderable number of indi- 
viduals who must occasionally cater for themselves 
— those men and women in business life, for ex- 
ample, who find it convenient neither to carry 
lunches nor to go to restaurants. For these, cheese 
offers a convenient way of supplying the necessary 
protein, for it can usually be obtained in good con- 
dition in any neighborhood. Combined with 
crackers, some of the ready-cooked cereals, or 



bread, and with fruit, it makes a fairly well-bal- 
anced meal. 

The average cheese while fresh and moist con- 
tains proteids and fat in much the same ratio as 
that in which they are found in the milk. More 
that one-fourth its weight is proteid, about one- 
third fats, and one-third water. There are always 
present small amounts of albumen and sugar which 
have clung to the curd. Owing to the addition 
of salt, the percentage of mineral matter is high 
compared with that of most other foods.

1 80 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Sec. IV— Pt. 2— COOKING AND RECIPES 



THE CARE OF CHEESE IN THE HOME 

One of the best ways of keeping cheese which 
has been cut is to wrap it in a slightly damp cloth 
and then in paper, and to keep it in a cool place. 
To dampen the cloth, sprinkle it and then wring it. 
It should seem hardly damp to the touch. Paraffin 
paper may be used in place of the cloth. When 
cheese is put in a covered dish, the air should 
never be wholly excluded, for if this is done, it 
molds more readily. 

In some markets it is possible to buy small whole 
cheeses. These may be satisfactorily kept by cut- 
ting a slice from the top, to serve as a cover, and 
removing the cheese as needed with a knife, a 
strong spoon, or a cheese scoop. 

CHEESE AS A FOOD 

Cheese is used in general in two ways — in 
small quantities chiefly for its flavor, and in large 
quantities for its nutritive value as well as for its 
flavor. Some varieties of cheese are used chiefly 
for the first purpose, others chiefly for the second. 
Those which are used chiefly for their flavor, many 
of which are high priced, contribute little to the 
food value of the diet, because of the small quan- 
tity used at a time. They have an important part 
to play, however, in making the diet attractive and 
palatable. 

Those cheeses which are suitable to be eaten in 
large quantities and which are comparatively low 
priced are important not only from the point of 
view of flavor, but also from the point of view of 
their nutritive value. Among such cheeses the one 
which, as noted above, is known to the trade as 
standard factory cheese and to the housewife as 
American cheese stands out pre-en>inently. There- 
fore, Vk^hen the word "cheese** is used without 
specification in the following pages it may be taken 
to refer to this particular variety. 

The liking for highly flavored cheeses of strong 
odor is a matter of individual preference, but from 
the chemist's standpoint there is no reason for the 
statement often made that such cheeses have under- 
gone putrefactive decomposition. 

COMPOSITION OF CHEESE AND SOME 
OTHER FOODS COMPARED 

In the present state of our knowledge concern- 
ing dietetics, it seems best to give the housekeeper 
general rather than absolute rules with respect to 
the kind and amount of food which should be eaten 
at any meal or at any given time by persons in 
normal health living under usual conditions. It is 
not necessary, therefore, for the housekeeper to 
know the exact composition of food materials in 
order to cater well for her family, a rough approxi- 
mation being sufficient for the purpose. In the case 
of cheese, she will be near enough to the fact if 
she thinks of it as composed approximately of 
equal parts by weight of proteids, fats, and water. 
This rough conception is sufficient to associate it 



in her mind with the foods of high proteid value, 
a point which is important in connection with the 
making of bills of fare. It should lead her to class 
it also with the foods which are rich in fat and 
prevent her from combining it unnecessarily with 
other fatty foods. 

The total amount of the mineral matter needed 
per day by the body is relatively small, yet mineral 
matter is very important. It is commonly assumed 
and is probably true, that a mixed diet reasonably 
varied and reasonably generous will supply all the 
ash constituent which the body requires. If for 
any reason calcium and phosphorus are lacking in 
the diet, the amounts may be readily increased by 
a free use of milk and such milk products as cheese 
and junket, without decreasing the palatability of 
the diet or materially increasing its cost. 

Since cheese is ready to be eaten when it comes 
from the market, it may be more interesting for 
some purposes to conipare its composition with 
that of cooked beef, freed from bone and fron> 
superfluous fat, such a piece as would be served 
to a person at the table. Weight for weight, cheese 
has appreciably more protein than such cooked 
beef, and 50 per cent, more fat. 

THE DIGESTIBILITY OF CHEESE 

As was stated above, cheese has been thought a 
cause of digestive disturbances, but work recently 
done by the Office of Ejcperiment Stations, in co- 
operation with the Bureau of Animal Industry, and 
briefly summed up in a recent publication, tends 
to disprove this. 

The statement refers to full-cream cheese. Ex- 
periments made at the same time gave practically 
the same values for the digestibility of skim-milk 
cheese, of Swiss cheese, of Roquefort and Camem- 
bert cheese, and of cottage cheese. 

The burning sensation or similar sensations some- 
times experienced after eating certain sorts of 
cheese has been attributed to the presence of small 
amounts of free fatty acids. It is commonly said 
that cheese is difficult to digest, the idea being that 
the body expends more labor in assimilating it than 
is required for other comparable foods. Experi- 
ments recently carried on by the Office of Experi- 
ment Stations, in which the respiration calorimeter 
was used to study the energy expenditure during 
the period of active digestion, do not indicate that 
cheese differs materially in ease of digestion from 
a comparable amount of meat. Uncooked full- 
cream cheese was used in these experiments. 
Another series recently begun by the OfHce of 
Experiment Stations with cooked cheese, though 
not yet sufficiently advanced to be conclusive, in- 
dicates that cheese thus eaten does not differ ma- 
terially from raw cheese in this respect. 

In connection with the use of cooked cheese in 
the diet, one fact should always be kept in mind. 
This is that, in common with all other fatty foods, 
cheese which has been overheated in cooking is 



CLASS 1 4— SAVORIES— CHEESE 



181 



likely to contain burned — that is, decomposed — 
fats. Disturbances from this cause, however, should 
be laid to poor cooking and not to the composition 
of this special food. 

Curds and Whey 

Cheese curds and whey, an old-fashioned dish, 
which is often spoken of in accounts of life in 
earlier times, sometimes refers to sour-milk curd 
and sometimes to curd separated with rennet. This 
dish, when made with rennet, is much like junket 
and though far less common today than was once 
the case, is wholesonte and palatable. 

Cottage Cheese 

This cheese is very commonly prepared in the 
home, and the process of making it is very simple. 
It consists merely of curdling the milk, separating 
the curd from the whey, seasoning, and pressing it. 

The curd is formed by the souring of the milk, 
and the process is hastened if the milk is kept warm, 
the best temperature being about blood heat, 96 
degrees F. A temperature much above this should 
be avoided, as the curd is likely to become hard 
and tough if much heated. The danger is usually 
not that the whole will be overheated but that the 
portion nearest the fire will be. In the old-fash- 
ioned kitchen there was usually a place where the 
milk could stand till it was uniformly warm through- 
out. With our present cooking arrangements it 
is often desirable to hasten the process. This may 
be done by setting the milk into a pan of warm 
water or by pouring hot water directly into the 
milk itself. The effect of the latter method is to 
remove much more of the acid than when the 
whey is left undiluted. Some consider this a great 
advantage. 

If, for any reason, the curd is overheated, it 
should be put through a meat chopper. This will 
msure cottage cheese of excellent texture. 

If the milk is thoroughly chilled before the whey 
is drained off it retains more of the fat than if 
this is done when warm. Under no circumstances, 
however, is much of the fat retained in cottage 
cheese. It is therefore more economical to make 
it out of skim milk and to add the fat to the curd 
in the form of butter or cream. 

Chopped parsley, caraway seeds, chopped olives, 
and pimiento may all be used for flavoring if such 
flavored cheese is preferred to plain cottage cheese. 

Cottage cheese is most commonly consumed 
immediately, but if made in quantity for commer- 
cial purposes, it may be packed in tubs and placed 
in cold storage. Sometimes it is formed into rolls 
or blocks and wrapped in tinfoil when marketed. 
Such cheese is used without ripening. 

Though cottage cheese is usually made by allow- 
ing the milk to sour naturally, it is sometimes more 
convenient to curdle the milk by adding rennet, 
and some housekeepers have a preference for cot- 



tage cheese thus made, since the flavor is milder 
and the acid taste which it possesses when made 
from sour milk is lacking. 

Sour-Cream Cheese 
when cream is to be made into cheese similar 
to cottage cheese, it should be drained without 
having previously been heated. The drainage is 
facilitated by moistening the cloth in salt water be- 
fore the cream is poured in. The curd is formed 
either by souring or by the addition of rennet. 

Uncooked Curd, or French Cottage ° Cheese 
The French make cheese from sour milk without 
heating it. They pour the milk into earthen molds 
which have holes in the bottom. A very fine sieve 
may be used instead of the molds. The whey 
drips out and the curd assumes a custardlike con- 
sistency and takes the shape of the mold. When 
sufficiently stiff, the cheese is chilled, and is eaten 
with sweet cream and sugar. It is a staple dessert 
in many French families, especially in hot weather, 
and is delicious served with acid fruit, such as cur- 
rants, or with strawberries. 

Junket 

If cottage cheese is made from sweet milk and 
rennet and served without breaking and separating 
the curd and whey, the dish is called junket. It 
is customary to season it a little, as with grated 
nutmeg or with cinnamon and sugar. 

Buttermilk Cheese 

At the Wisconsin Experiment Station a method 
has been devised for making a soft, moist cheese 
out of buttermilk. When made on a large scale, 
as it might be in creameries, there are various pre- 
cautions to be taken, which are pointed out in the 
publication cited. In making it in small quantities, 
these precautions are unnecessary, and the method 
is even simpler than that of making cottage cheese, 
because the quality does not depend so much on 
the temperature. 

To make the buttermilk cheese, heat buttermilk 
gradually to about 130 or 140 degrees F. Allow 
it to cool, and strain it. As the curd will settle to 
the bottom, most of the whey may be poured off 
before the draining is begun. 

This cheese is, of course, almost wholly without 
fat, and yet — probably because the particles of 
curd are very finely divided — it has a smooth con- 
sistency, which suggests the presence of fat. It may 
be served seasoned with salt only, or it may be 
mixed with butter or cream and seasonings. It is 
suitable for combining with olives and pimientos, 
or for any use to which the ordinary cream cheeses 
are put. 

Buttermilk Cream 

This product also was devised by the Wisconsin 
Elxperiment Station. By controlling the tempera- 
ture in heating the buttermilk and not allowing it 



1 82 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Sec. IV— Pt. 2— COOKING AND RECIPES 



to go above 1 00 degrees F., a compound is made 
which after draining has the consistency of a very 
thick cream. It is claimed by the station investi- 
gators that this "cream" is suitable for eating on 
bread in place of butter. 

Devonshire Cream 

Devonshire cream somewhat resembles sweet 
cream in flavor and consistency. It is very much 
liked in England, where it is commonly eaten with 
fresh or preserved fruit, but is not so well known 
in America. 



To make Devonshire cream, allow a pan of whole 
milk to stand for 24 hours in a cool place, or for 
1 2 hours in a warmer place. Place the pan on 
the cooler part of the stove and heat until the milk 
is very hot, but not to the boiling point. If heated 
too much, a thick skin wrill form on the surface. 
The more slowly the milk is heated the better. 
Having been heated, the milk should be kept in 
a cool place for 24 hours and then skimmed. Tli« 
thick cream obtained has a characteristic flavor and 
texture.

FOOD VALUE OF SALADS

A well prepared salad is an excellent food. Salads supply water, mineral 
salts, acids, cellulose and flavor to the diet. 

The ingredients should be fresh and cold and it should be pleasing in appear- 
ance as well as flavor. 

A great variety of materials are used in salads: fruits, green and cooked 
vegetables, eggs, meat, fish, cheese, nuts, etc. 

Green vegetables should be crisp, cold and dry when served. If water is 
left on the leaves the salad and salad dressing will be poor in flavor. 

Salad dressing should be added just before time of serving as the salad ma- 
terial wilts if allowed to stand after the dressing has been added. 

VALUE IN DIET 
Fruits and Vegetables 

1. Supply water. 4. Supply cellulose. 

2. Supply mineral salts. 5. Supply flavor. 

3. Supply acids. 6. Supply variety. 
Salad vegetables often contain 90 per cent, or 

more of water, which in itself is useful in the 
system in many ways. 

They furnish only a small quantity of protein, 
which varies from 1.5 to 4 per cent. In addition, 
they contain cellulose, chlorophyll, sugars, gum, 
pectin and sometimes a little fat.

POINTS TO REMEMBER 



Meat, fish, eggs and cheese supply protein and 
fat in the diet. Starchy vegetables supply fuel 
food. Salad dressings supply fuel food. Salad 
plants should be: 

I. Tender. 2. Cold. 3. Crisp. 

Salad materials should not be crushed and 
should be symmetrical in shape. Gather green vege- 
tables in the early morning or after sunset: keep 
in a cool place (not directly on ice) and keep 
closely wrapped in waxed paper. 



Vegetables should be carefully dried and exposed 
to the air for a few minutes before adding the 
dressing, as water and oil do not mix. 

Salads dressed at the table should first be sprin- 
kled with salt and pepper, then oil added, and, 
lastly, vinegar or lemon juice. 

A salad is perfectly dressed when each individual 
leaf or bit of vegetable is lightly coated with oil 
or appropriate dressing. 



MAKING SALADS 



The first step in making a good salad is to have good materials, fresh, crisp 
vegetables raw or carefully cooked, good oil and vinegar. Prepare these with care, 
wash and dry green stuff, drain and cut up cooked vegetables or meats in attrac- 
tive diced pieces put away to cool. Either make the dressing and put on ice, or 
mix it at table, or use one of the excellent bottled dressings now sold at all good 
food shops. But remember neVer toss up the salad with the dressing until just be- 
fore serving. 

Salads made of minced meat, vegetables and dressing are not dinner salads 
when meat is the main dish, but should be used rather for supper or light luncheon. 

Fruit combines with nuts and lettuce and dressing hold all the food value 
of a meat salad and are a refreshing substitute for meat at a mid luncheon. 

When fresh green vegetables are not obtainable there are always the care- 
fully canned asparagus, peas, etc., and when fresh fruit is rare the delicious canned 
pineapple, pears, grapes, etc., are on the market. 

Canned meats and even raisins and nuts offer endless opportunities for a 
good salad. 

All salads depend largely on the dressing. Fruit salads are better with a rich 
mayonnaise or a butter and cream dressing with a dash of sugar. The vegetable 
salads need a more highly seasoned French dressing and no sugar. 

Meat salads may take either a French dressing or mayonnaise without su- 
gar and seasoned with the meat's appropriate sauce. For beef use a bit of grated 
horseradish; pork or ham. Chili sauce; lamb, chopped capers; veal or fish, tomato 
mayonnaise or a few drops of catsup; fowl, plain mayonnaise. 

Pure salad oil has a faint nutty odor when it has any at all, is pale green in 
color and tastes somewhat like the ripe olives from which it is made. It should 
blend easily with condiments. 

RECIPES 



Mayonnaise Dressing — The secret of success 
with mayonnaise is to have the dish, beater and 
materials ice cold, to work quickly, and place at 
once on ice. 

Stir into yolk of I egg, a mixture of Vi teasp. 
mustard, Yi teasp. salt, I teasp. sugar, dash of 
paprika and cayenne. Beat thoroughly and stead- 
ily, adding drop by drop 1 cupful olive oil. When 
dressing is stiff, thin slowly with I tbsp. lemon 
juice, then 1 tbsp. vinegar. Should oil not thicken 
egg at once, add '/4 teasp. unbeaten white of egg 
or a few drops of vinegar will make it smooth 



again. It should be thick enough to cut with a 
spoon before adding rest of vinegar. Put on ice. 
When salad is ready to serve, mix in lightly only 
small portion of mayonnaise; drop the remainder 
on top. 



Colored Mayonnaise Green mayonnaise is made 

by adding the juice from a small quantity of 
mashed spinach or parsley. Strain through cheese- 
cloth before putting it in the mayonnaise dressing. 

To color it red, add beet juice or juice of lobster 
coral.

chill. Mix in a bowl, sprinkle with salt, stir in 
mayonnaise. Serve on lettuce with plain or 
tomato mayonnaise. 

If omitting the celery, mix with pulp of scooped 
out fresh tomato and return to tomato. Serve with 
dressing. 

With vegetable salads it is sontetimes well to use 
as a body for the salad either potatoes sliced thin, 
cooked rice, each grain separated, or well dried 
macaroni cut in inch pieces. 

Some kinds of vegetables combine better than 
others, as beans, peas, cauliflower, tender carrots, 
asparagus, and again turnips with beets, carrots, 
cabbage and tomatoes. 

Mixed Vegetable Salad — Use firm boiled potatoes 
sliced thin; slice cucumbers and fresh tomatoes. 
Mince and marinate separately I Spanish onion,

dressing. Serve in a bed of lettuce. Garnish with 
chopped parsley and sliced hard whites. 

Potato Salad with Eggs — Put a layer of sliced 
cold boiled potatoes on lettuce leaves in a bowf 
rubbed with onion juice. Arrange in layers above 
them either sliced cucumbers or hard boiled eggs. 
Sprinkle each layer with seasonings of Yz teasp. 
salt, Ya teasp. pepper, Yz cup diced celery mixed 
with I cup boiled dressing. When serving do not 
mash; lift salad out lightly with fork. 

Potato Salad — Pare and boil potatoes: chop fine 
when cold, season with raw onion sliced thin. 
Make a dressing of yolks of 3 hard boiled eggs, 
mashed fine, salt and mustard to taste; then add 
enough olive oil or melted butter to make a paste.

mixing thoroughly; to this add 1 cup vinegar 
gradually, beat well with the paste and mix with 
potatoes. 

Plain Egg Salad — Press hard boiled egg yolks 
through a ricer. Place sliced whites on lettuce and 
chickory, sprinkle the riced yolks over, then salt 
and pepper, and, last, drop on some creamy salad 
dressing. 

Egg and Cream Cheese Salad — Mix yolks of hard 
boiled eggs with equal amount creani cheese, few 
grains cayenne, salt, chopped nuts. Mold flat with 
hand. Cut with silver knife into strips 3 inches 
long, Yi inch wide. Lay two strips on a lettuce 
leaf for each place; drop mayonnaise in space 
between strips, or if too rich pour over a French 
dressing. Garnish with hard whites, sliced. 

Lettuce Salad — Have ready a salad spoon and 
fork, a small bowl, vinegar, oil, salt and pepper, 
and a large bowl of crisp cold lettuce. Into the

STRUCTURE AND COMPOSITION OF VEGETABLES 

By Maria Parloa. 

(U. S. Farmers' Bulletin No. 256) 

Plants are made up of innumerable cells, each consisting of a thin mem- 
branous wall inclosing a semifluid mass, in which lie the nucleus or center of cell 
activity and minute grains of starch or other material which the plant has elaborated. 

The whole framework of the very young plants is made up of these cell 
walls, commonly called cellular tissue or cellulose. How^ever, early in the growth 
of the plant wood cells begin to develop. The v^ood cells grow into a fibrous sub- 
stance that may be torn apart like threads, which is called woody fiber. It is this 
woody fiber and the thickening and hardening of the cellular tissue that make poor- 
ly grown or stale vegetables hard and indigestible. 

Practically all green plants contain a large percentage of water v^^ith a larger 
or smaller percentage of starch and some nitrogenous material (protein), sugar, 
gum, crude fiber, and other carbohydrate and mineral matter. The fruits and seeds 
of some plants are rich in fat, but the plant itself rarely contains any appreciable 
amount of this constituent. 

Most vegetables contain small amounts of volatile essential oils or other 
bodies of pronounced flavor and owe their characteristic taste to such constitu- 
ents; sugars and acids when present, as they often are, and mineral salts, found in 
all vegetable foods, also contribute their share toward the flavor. 

CLASSIFICATION OF VEGETABLES. 

Vegetable foods may be divided into a few general classes. These are cereals, leg- 
umes, tubers, roots and bulbs, herbaceous or green vegetables, and vegetable fruits and 
flowers. The cereals are the most valuable of the vegetable foods, including as they do 
the grains from which is made nearly all the bread of the world. The use of cereals for 
bread making, for breakfast foods, and in similar ways is taken up elsewhere. In this bulle- 
tin rice and corn are the only cereals considered, as they are the only grains commonly em- 
ployed as table vegetables. 

Rice is largely composed of starch and has very small proportions of nitrogenous, 
fatty, and mineral matter. Therefore, when used as a vegetable, it is naturally and very 
properly served with foods rich in the constituents which it lacks. 

Legumes belong to the pulse family. The fruit is usually in the shape of a pod. Al- 
though there are several thousand species of the Leguminosae or pulse, only a few kinds 
are used as table vegetables, beans, peas, cowpeas, and lentils being the legumes princi- 
pally employed as human food. The dried seeds of beans, peas, and lentils constitute a 
most valuable all-the-year-round food supply. The seeds occupy small space, keep well, and 
may be prepared in a great many appetizing and nutritious forms. 

191 



1 92 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Sec. IV— Pt. 2— COOKING AND RECIPES 

The ripe leguminous seeds are very rich in nitrogenous matter. Peas, beans, cow- 
peas, and lentils contain on an average 25 per cent nitrogenous matter and over 50 per cent 
starch, and about 1 per cent cellulose, fatty matter, and mineral matter. When properly 
cooked and consumed in reasonable quantities peas, beans, and lentils may replace a portion 
of the meat in the daily dietary. The unripe legumes and their edible pods, like all green 
vegetables, are quite succulent foods, the proportion of nutritive material being small as 
compared with the water present. 

Since the fatty matter in the legumes enumerated does not average 3 per cent they 
are commonly and wisely cooked with some added fat. The green seeds and the green 
pods of peas and beans are not so highly nutritious as the dried seed, but they are more 
delicate and apparently more easily digested. J 

Among the foods served as table vegetables, tubers and roots have an important 
place. The potato comes next to the cereals in its almost universal employment and the 
material consumed. We have no other vegetable that lends itself to such a variety of pre- 
parations. The potato contains a large percentage of water, a fair percentage of starch, a 
very small percentage of sugar, and nitrogenous, fatty, and gummy matter, and about 1 per 
cent of mineral matter. The mineral matter consists of potash and soda salts, citrates, 
phosphates, magnesia, and silicate of lime. It is to this mineral matter that the potato owes 
its antiscorbutic properties. 

The sweet potato is rich in starch and sugar. The percentage of nitrogenous and 
fatty matter is very small. TTiis vegetable makes a pleasant and healthful addition to the 
table. It is somewhat leixative. 

The true roots most used as table vegetables are beets, radish, turnips, parsnips, 
carrots, salsify, and celeriac. Both the parsnip and salsify withstand frost and may be left 
in the ground all winter, thus making it possible to have these vegetables in the early spring 
as well as in the fall. However, they must not be left in the ground too late in the season 
the following spring, as they soon grow hard and fibrous. Turnips, beets, and carrots, for 
summer and fall use, should be of the quick-growing kind, and should not be allowed to 
grow to great size. To have these vegetables in perfection it is necessary to sow them fre- 
quently during the season. When grown for winter use, these roots, like all vegetables that 
are to be stored, must, of course, develop until mature, else they will not keep well. 

The bulb-bearing plants belong to the lily family, the onion being the bulb most 
generally used as a vegetable and flavorer. On the Continent of Europe very many other 
members of the onion family are also freely used as flavorers, and no continental kitchen 
garden would be considered complete without several varieties, such as the common onion, 
leek, shallot, garlic, chives, and cibol. Much of the delicious flavor of the French and 
Italian cookery is due to the skillful combination of several of the onion flavors. 

The herbaceous vegetables, cabbage, lettuce, celery, spinach, etc., are valuable for 
their refreshing qualities, the salts they yield, and the variety they give to our diet, but owing 
to the amount of water they contain (90 per cent or more on an average) their food value 
is low. The leaves, stems, and shoots are the parts used as food. These vegetables should 
be employed while young and tender; the more rapidly the vegetables grow the more ten- 
der they will be. 

Fruits used as vegetables include tomatoes, okra, squash, pumpkin, cucumber, egg- 
plant, and peppers, among others. Such fruits as muskmelon and watermelon are used as 
fruits rather than as vegetables, and are not taken up here. In the case of globe or French 
artichoke, cauliflower, and broccoli the flower buds or inflorescence are the parts eaten. 



CLASS 1 6— VEGETABLES— PREPARATION 193 

GENERAL PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING VEGETABLE COOKING. 

Vegetables are baked, roasted, fried, or boiled, are used for making a g^reat variety 
of dishes, and are prepared for the table in other ways; but the most common method of 
cooking them is in boiling water. Steaming is not infrequently resorted to as a method of 
cooking vegetables and is, of course, similar in principle to boiling in water. 

The simpler the methods of cooking and serving vegetables the better. A properly 
grown and well-cooked vegetable will be palatable and readily digestible. Badly cooked, 
water-soaked vegetables very generally cause digestive disturbances, which are often seri- 
ous. Nearly every vegetable may be cooked so that with plain bread it may form a pala- 
table course by itself, if it is desired to serve it in this manner. 

All green vegetables, roots, and tubers should be crisp and firm when put on to cook. 
If for any reason a vegetable has lost its firmness and crispiness, it should be soaked in very 
cold water until it becomes plump and crisp. With new vegetables this will be only a mat- 
ter of minutes, while old roots and tubers often require many hours. All vegetables should 
be thoroughly cleaned just before being put on to cook. Vegetables that form in heads, 
such as cabbage, cauliflower, and Brussels sprouts, should be soaked, heads turned down, 
in salted cold water, to which a few spoonfuls of vinegar may be added. If there are any 
worms or other forms of animal life in these vegetables, they will crawl out. To secure 
the best results all vegetables except the dried legumes must be put in boiling water, and 
the water must be made to boil again as soon as possible after the vegetables have been 
added, and must be kept boiling until the cooking is finished. Herbaceous vegetables 
should boil rapidly all the time. With tubers, roots, cauliflower, etc., the ebullition should 
not be so violent as to break the vegetables. Green beans and peas when removed from 
the pod must also be cooked gently, i. e., just simmer. When the pods and all are used 
they are to be cooked rapidly, like the herbaceous vegetables. 

To secure the most appetizing and palatable dishes, only fresh, tender vegetables 
should be cooked. If, however, g^een beans, peas, etc., have grown until a little too old 
and it still seems best to gather them, a very small piece of baking soda added to the 
water in which they are boiled makes them more tender, it is commonly believed, and helps 
to retain the color. Too much soda injures the flavor, and an excess must be carefully 
avoided. A little soda may also be used to advantage if the water is quite hard. Peas 
may be boiled for fifteen or twenty minutes in the water to which the soda has been added, 
then to be cooked the same as peas with pork. 

During the cooking of all vegetables the cover must be drawn to one side of the 
stewpan to allow the volatile bodies liberated by the heat to pass off in the steam. All vege- 
tables should be thoroughly cooked, but the cooking should stop while the vegetable is still 
firm. Tliis, of course, does not apply to vegetables that are cooked in soups, purees (thick 
strained soups), etc. The best seasoning for most vegetables is salt and good butter. 
Vegetables that are blanched and then cooked ^th butter and other seasonings and very 
little moisture are more savory and nutritious than when all the cooking is done in a good 
deal of clear water. 

BLANCHING VEGETABLES AS A COOKING PROCESS. 

Blanching, which in cookery in entirely different from the bleaching or blanching 
of green vegetables in the garden, is a cooking process often used with vegetables, since 
it removes the strong or acrid taste and improves the quality. It is also convenient, since 
blanching may be done at any time, and the cooking completed in a very short time when 
the dish is to be served. 

Have a large stewpan half full of rapidly boiling water. Add a tablespoonful of 
salt for every 2 quarts of water. Have the vegetables cleaned and well drained. Drop 



1 94 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Sec. IV— Pt. 2— COOKING AND RECIPES 

them into the boiling water, and bring the water back to the boiling point as quickly as 
possible. Boil rapidly, with the cover partially or wholly off the stewpan, five to twenty 
minutes, depending upon the vegetable, then drain off the water. If the cooking of the 
vegetable is not to be finished at once,, pour cold water over the vegetable to cool 
it quickly, then drain and set aside until needed. If the cooking is to be continued 
at once, it will not be necessary to rinse the vegetable with cold water. To com- 
plete the cooking the vegetable should be put in a small stewpan w^ith butter or drip- 
pings and the other seasonings and cooked gently until done. A few spoonfuls of 
liquid will be required for every quart of very juicy vegetables, and half a pint of liquid for 
drier vegetables. The stewpan is to be covered, only a slight opening being left for ven- 
tilation. All vegetables cooked in this manner should be cut up rather small either before 
or after the blanching. 

LOSSES IN COOKING VEGETABLES. 

In baking vegetables there is little loss of material except the water which is driven 
off by the heat. When vegetables are immersed in water, as in boiling, a greater or less 
loss of material is almost inevitable, the kind and amount of material extracted by the 
water depending upon such factors as the sort of water used, its temperature at the begin- 
ning and during the cooking period, the length of time the cooking is continued, and the 
condition of the vegetable, that is, whether pared, whole, or cut into small pieces. 

INDIAN CORN. 

(U. S. Farmers' Bulletin 559) 

Indian corn is peculiarly an American product, being native to American soil. 
The \\rays of preparing it for human food are very numerous, and many of them, 
like the cereal itself, are of Indian origin. 

COMPOSITION OF INDIAN CORN 

The varieties of Indian corn are many, white and yellov^r types being very 
common, red not uncommon, and even blue and black corn being found in the 
southwestern United States. There is a widespread popular belief that the food 
value of these different sorts varies as greatly as their color, but this is not the 
case. White, yellow, red, blue, and black corn are very much alike in composition, 
and are therefore equally valuable as sources of nourishment. They vary some- 
what, however, in flavor. The liking for one or another is a personal or local matter. 

COMPARISON OF DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE KERNEL. 

The percentage composition of Indian corn as given above is that of the whole kernel 
as distinguished from any of its parts. A grain of corn is complex in structure, and its 
different parts vary greatly in nutritive value. For our purpose here it may be considered 
to consist of skin, germ, and endosperm. The skin constitutes about 6 per cent of the 
whole weight of the kernel; the germ, which contains the embryo, from which under fav- 
orable conditions new life will spring, constitutes about 10 per cent; and the endosperm, 
which is the storehouse of food for the new life, constitutes about 84 per cent. Of the 
total amount of crude fiber in a kernel of com, 51 per cent is in the skin; of the starch, 
90 per cent is in the endosperm; and of the protein, 80 per cent is in the endosperm and 
16 per cent in the germ; while of the fat, 65 per cent is in the germ. 

A SPECIAL USE FOR CORN MEAL. 

Corn meal, because of its lack of gluten, cannot be made into light and porous breads 
except by the addition of eggs or of wheat, rye, Graham, or gluten flour, or in some similar 



CLASS 1 6— VEGETABLES— POTATOES 195 

way. The absence of gluten, which with water forms a sticky, tenacious mass, is responsi- 
ble, however, for the fact that the meal retains much of its granular quality even after it has 
been mixed and heated with water. Dishes made with corn meal are likely to be more 
tender than those made with wheat, and the use of small amounts of corn meal in the mak- 
ing of such foods as waffles and doughnuts is to be recommended. 

COOKING CORN MEAL. 

A study of the modifications in methods of cooking which have been rendered 
necessary by changes in the composition of the meal was made at Teachers College, Co- 
lumbia University, New York City, for the Office of Experiment Stations. The results of 
these investigations, which are still unpublished, may be summarized as follows: In gen- 
eral, 1 per cent more water is needed for the new-process meal than for the old-process, 
and where the large amount of water used renders the meal liable to sink (in breads, for 
example), the mixture of meal and water should be thoroughly heated before being used. 

In experiments made in this office it was found that, when convenience as well as 
the final result is taken into consideration, it is best for almost every purpose to put the 
meal and cold water together and then heat them over boiling water in a double boiler. 
ELxcept ■when very finely ground meals are used it is unnecessary to stir the mixture at any 
time, not even when the meal and water are put together. The conclusion has been 
reached, in fact, that in all cases — even those in which the liquid used is not water but 
either sweet or sour milk — the best results are obtained by heating the meal and liquid 
together without stirring. This applies to the making of cornmeal mush and also to more 
complicated dishes, such as breads. 



PLENTY OF POTATOES 

(U. S. Food Adminstration Food Leaflet No. 10) 

They Are a Splendid Food. Excellent For Your Body. 
Delicious When Well Cooked. 

WHAT THEY DO FOR YOUR BODY. 

They are good fuel. They furnish starch which burns in your muscles to 
let you work, much as the gasoHne burns in an automobile engine to make the 
car go. 

One medium-sized potato gives you as much starch as two slices of bread. 
When you have potatoes for a meal you need less bread. Potatoes can save wheat. 

They give you salts like other vegetables. You need the salts to build and 
renevs' all the parts of your body and to keep it in order. 

POTATOES AT THEIR BEST. 
One old king is said to have tested each cook before hiring him by asking 
him to boil a potato. Even the best potato can be spoiled by a poor cook. 

TO BOIL THEM so that they will be "fit for a king," drop the unpeeled 
potatoes into boiling salted water and cook 20 to 30 minutes. Drain the water off 
at once. If they are cooked too long or allowed to stand in the water they get 
soggy. 

If you peel the potatoes before cooking them you will waste time and pota- 
toes both. You may thrown away a sixth or even a quarter of the good part of the 
potato wfith the skins. Also, if the potatoes aren't covered up by the skins v^^hile 
cooking, some of the valuable material will soak out into the water. Even very 
small potatoes can be economically used, if they are boiled in their skins. 



196 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Sec. IV— Pt. 2— COOKING AND RECIPES 

FOR BEST MASHED POTATOES. Peel the boiled potatoes, mash and 
beat until very light, adding salt, butter or oleomargarine and hot milk, a half cup 
of milk to six potatoes. If dinner is not ready to serve, pile lightly in a pan and set 
in the oven to brown. 

POTATOES ARE GOOD IN BREADS. Get Farmers' Bulletin No. 807. 
"Bread and Bread Making in the Home," from the Department of Agriculture, 
Washington, D. C., to learn how to make potato yeast bread. 

POTATOES ARE GOOD IN CAKE. They are often used in this way to 
keep the cake from drying out quickly. Mash the potatoes and beat up with milk 
until very light. You can use your usual cake recipe, substituting one cup of 
mashed potatoes for one-half cup of milk and one-half cup of flour. 

POTATOES FOR YOUR MAIN DISH. Potatoes, left over or fresh, may 
be combined with cheese or nuts or meat or other material, often to make the main 
dish of a meal. 

VEGETABLES FOR WINTER 

(U. S. Food Administration Food Leaflet No. 9) 

Everybody Needs Them — Grown People and Children, Too. 

DON'T STOP USING 'them IN WINTER even if they are harder to get 
than in summer. 

Doctors say that the tired-out feeling at the end of the winter — "spring 
fever" — often comes from a lack of fruits and vegetables in the winter diet. Keep 
the family well and make their meals pleasanter by using vegetables. Give them 
to children especially. Young children can digest them better if they are mashed 
and put through a sieve. 

The salts or "mineral matter" that vegetables contain is one of your chief 
helps in keeping your body strong and well. 

In every part of your body there are salts somewhat like table talt, but of 
many kinds — iron, lime and others. Your body won't work smoothly unless it 
has plenty of these salts, and the children can't build strong bodies without them. 
You must get them from your food. Vegetables and fruit are rich in them. Eat 
a variety so as to be sure to get all the kinds of salts you need. 

The salts and other substances in vegetables also help prevent constipation. 
Keep yourself and your children well. 

FRESH WINTER VEGETABLES. . 
These include cabbage, turnips, onions, carrots, potatoes, etc., which are 
always good simply cooked, stewed, boiled or baked, and served with a little butter 
or oleomargarine or a simple cream sauce. You waste valuable salts when you 
throw away the water in which you cook vegetables. Sometimes the flavor is 
not desirable, but if it is good, save the water for soup or gravy. Even better- 
cook them in as little water as possible so there is none left to drain oft. Ur bake 

or steam them. , , , . i . i i j i. u 

Cabbage is one of the vegetables that is best simply cooked, it may be poor 
or it may be delicious, depending upon how you cook it. Don't boil it too long— 
20 or 30 minutes in salted water is long enough. , , , , 

The winter vegetables are excellent, too, combined with meats to make 

savory stews. 



CLASS 1 6— VEGETABLES— DIRECTIONS 197 

CANNED VEGETABLES. 

Often canned vegetables need only skillful seasoning to make them as good 
as fresh. Chopped onions or green peppers may add a good flavor. Of course, 
you will not use any canned vegetables about which there is a suspicion of spoilage. 

Canned corn is very good when turned into a baking dish, milk and season- 
ing added, and the whole heated through in the oven and allowed to brown on top. 
Outside stalks of celery cut up, a green pepper, or both, added before baking, make 
the dish more appetizing. 

DRIED VEGETABLES. 

Do you use them? They are as good as canned or better. Dried beans 
and peas are well known. Besides these, you can dry all kinds yourself, especially 
if you have a garden and get them fresh. The only change that takes place is the 
loss of water. The salts and other valuable parts are the same as in the fresh. 
Farmers' Bulletin 841 tells \\o\f to dry vegetables. 

To prepare dried vegetables for cooking first soak them for several hours or 
overnight so that they w^ill take up the water lost in drying. Then cook them exact- 
ly as you would fresh ones — as a vegetable, in soups, or with meat. They make 
a good, economical addition to your winter meals. 

VEGETABLES SAVE MEAT AND WHEAT. 

Beans and peas have long been used in place of some meat. Like meat, 
they furnish protein which the body needs. 

Potatoes and other starchy vegetables can save wheat. Use them in bread 
making or use less bread at the meals where such vegetables are served. Bread 
and starchy vegetables are both good sources of body fuel. 

VARIETY AND FLAVOR IN YOUR MEALS. 



VEGETABLES— GENERAL DIRECTIONS 

Select fresh, crisp vegetables and prepare for cooking as soon as possible. 
They should be kept in a cool place. Turnips, carrots, parsnips and similiar roots 
may be kept plump and fresh by being put into boxes filled with earth or sand and 
kept in a cool place. 

Wash vegetables in cold, cook in boiling water. Cook green or top-ground 
vegetables uncovered. Put in 1 teaspoon salt to each quart of water. White or 
underground vegetables are better when salt is added after cooking. 

Soak dried peas, beans, lentils and dried fruits over night. Soak old pota- 
toes in cold water 1 hour before cooking. Freshen wilted vegetables by putting on 
ice or in cold water to which a little borax is added. 

Open canned goods 1 hour before using. Empty from can at once, drain 
in colander, pour cold water over and put in cool place. 

To prevent odors from arising from cabbage, cauliflower, onions, turnips, 
cook rapidly uncovered or add a piece of charcoal. 

The water in which cabbage or turnips have been boiled will be found ex- 
cellent for cooking dried vegetables such as beans or lentils, macaroni or spaghetti. 

Sprinkle a little salt on parsley when chopping; it will chop much finer and 
easier.

RECIPES 



Asparagus — ^This may be served as a vegetable 
hot, or as a salad cold with French dressing. 

On Toast — Wash green asparagus, cut off the 
toughest part of the thick ends, tie in a bunch 
and boil gently 20 or 30 minutes in enough salted 
water to cover. If canned asparagus is used, drain 
off the water in the can, remove the stalks without 
breaking to a saucepan, cover with boiling salted 
water until heated through. Serve on buttered 
toast with melted butter or HoUandaise sauce. 

Creamed — Cut up all the tender parts of a bunch 
of boiled asparagus. Boil down the water in which 
it has been cooked to 2/3 cupful, add 3 tbsp. 
cream, cook to a thick sauce, add 14 teasp. salt, 
few grains paprika and pour over asparagus. 
Serve on squares of toast or in sauce dishes. This 
may be varied by adding a minced hard boiled egg 
to the sauce, or by laying a slice of tomato on 
the toast before pouring the creamed asparagus 
over. 

Baked — Lay the tender parts of two bunches 
of cooked asparagus in a shallow casserole or 
baking pan. Put around and over them minced 
cooked ham. Pour over all 4 eggs, !4 teasp. 
salt, '/a teasp. pepper, 4 tbsp. minced ham beaten 
together as for omelets. Bake until the eggs are 
lightly set, about 5 minutes. Serve at luncheon 
with mashed or stuffed potatoes, or watercress and 
fresh tomatoes. 



Luncheon Asparagus with Vegetable Mayon- 
naise Arrange 4 individual portions of buttered 

toast or fried bread on a long dish. Place on these 
cold cooked asparagus and pour over them a cold 
vegetable mayonnaise sauce made of Yi cupful 
shredded cooked vegetables, as carrots, turnips, 
green beans, mixed with 1 cup thick mayonnaise. 
Chill on ice until time to serve. 

Artichokes — Cut the stalks close of 1 2 arti' 
chokes, clip sharp points from leaves, wash and 
lay in cold salted water for 20 minutes. Cook in 
boiling salted water about 45 minutes. They 
should be tender enough to draw out the leaves. 
Drain, serve hot with HoUandaise sauce or serve 
cold on lettuce leaves vrith a vinaegrette sauce of 
6 tbsp. olive oil beaten with 1 tbsp. vinegar, salt, 
and red pepper, chopped parsley and chopped 
capers, or small pickles. 

Beets — Select young fresh beets, old ones will 
never cook tender; wash, cut off leaves one inch 
from beets, cook in boiling water about 20 minutes. 
When done, skin, slice into a hot dish and pour 
over butter to which a little sugar has been added. 
Cover to keep hot till served. 

Brussel Sprouts — Pick off all dark leaves, lay in 
salted water 1 5 minutes. Drain, cook in boiling 
water uncovered till tender. Drain, serve at once 
with a good cream sauce. 



CLASS 1 6 — VEGETABLES— RECIPES

String Beans — I. Select them young and crisp, 
string, break in halves, boil about I hour in just 
enough water to cover. When tender and water 
Dearly gone add pepper and salt, butter, and Yl 
cup cream. Simmer 3 minutes, serve on a hot 
dish. One or two slices of salt pork boiled with 
the beans add to the richness of their flavor, then 
omit the cream in the sauce. 

2. Parboil I qt. green string beans 30 minutes; 
drain, add 2 tbsp. butter, 1 teasp. sugar, Yi teasp. 
salt, dash of pepper. Cook slowly 5 minutes, then 
add 54 cup meat stock, '/4 cup water the beans 
were boiled in, Yl teasp. lemon juice. Simmer 
till tender. 

Lima Beans — Soak all dried beans overnight and 
cook next day in boiling water for 40 minutes, or 
until tender. Add salt 10 minutes before done, 
drain, season with butter, salt, or a cream sauce, or 
cook a piece of salt pork with them. 

Boston Baked Beans Soak I lb. California pea 

beans overnight. Next morning simmer slowly in 
water to cover, add '/4 teasp. soda. When beans 
are swelled but not bursted lift out into clear hot 
water for a few minutes. Wash and score Yl ^■ 
salt pork. Put into a hot earthen bean pot a layer 
of beans, the pork in the center, then fill up with 
beans. Dissolve in boiling water 1 tbsp. molasses, 
!4 teasp. mustard, 1 teasp. salt. Pour over the 
beans and fill pot with boiling water. Bake slowly 
5 or 6 hours. Keep beans almost covered with 
water until the last hour, then let water cook two- 
thirds away. 

Frijoles con Queso — Boil I pt. red beans till 
soft and water boiled down; drain, turn into fry- 
ing pan with 2 tbsp. butter, salt, cayenne, and 
!4 lb. grated cheese. Stir until cheese thoroughly 
blends. Serve hot. 

Kidney Bean Stew — Put on to stew I cup soaked 
red kidney beans with I pt. canned tomatoes, Yi 
teasp. pepper, I teasp. salt. Clean, cut up 1 small 
oxtail; add to the beans with water to cover. Sim- 
mer 3 hours, add a sprig of parsley the last half 
hour. 

Bean Loaf — Mash fine 1 cup cooked beans, add 
I Yl cups bread crumbs, i4 green pepper, minced, 

1 cup cream or rich milk, 1 cup cooked tomatoes, 
few grains paprika, Ya teasp. salt. Mix all together. 
Bake in buttered dish in moderate oven 1 hour. 
Serve hot or cold, sliced. If the green pepper is 
omitted, garnish with thin slices of pimiento. 

Kidney Beans and Rice (with Brown Sauce) — 
Cook 1 pt. shelled beans in salted water until ten- 
der. Make a brown sauce of 2 tbsp. butter or beef 
suet browned, I tbsp. flour stirred in and browned, 

2 cups beef stock added. Season with salt and 
pepper. When beans are done, add brown sauce 
and 1 cup cooked rice. Cook 1 minute. If gravy 



is used in place of stock, omit the butter. In food 
value this dish takes the place of both meat and 
potatoes. 

The Soy Bean or "Togo Bean" — Soy beans are 
rich in protein and fat and lacking in starch, so 
should be cooked without fat pork and served at 
the same meal with a starchy vegetable, as rice, 
to make a balanced ration. Any recipe for dried 
beans may be used for Soy beans by omitting the 
fat pork. 

Soy Bean Loaf — Pick over and mash 2 cupfuls 
Soy beans. Cover with water and let stand at 
least 1 2 hours. Drain. Cook in fresh water with 
Yl level teasp. salt until tender, longer than the I 
hour for navy beans. When done, drain, put aside 
the water for soup. Serve the beans plain with 
rice and spinach, or mash beans and cool for a 
loaf. Add I minced onion, a pinch of cayenne 
and black pepper, 2 cups toasted bread crumbs, 
I Yl cups milk. Mix well, fold in 2 well-beaten 
eggs. Bake in a flat buttered pan for 40 minutes, 
basting with Ya cup milk. Brown, slice and serve 
hot with tomato sauce and boiled rice. 

Lentil Croquettes — Soak and cook lentils as 
dried beans. Rub I cup soft cooked lentils through 
strainer to remove skins. Mix with 1 cup cooked 
rice, Yl cup milk, I beaten egg, a bit of sage and 
salt to taste. Form into croquettes, roll in beaten 
egg, then in bread crumbs. Moisten the tops with 
a little milk and bake in oven until brown. 

Succotash Put soaked lima beans on to boil. 

When almost done, add corn cut from the cobs. 
Have twice as much corn as beans. Boil together 
20 minutes, until nearly dry, adding butter if the 
beans have not been boiled with salt pork. Season 
with pepper and salt, Yl cup rich milk. Simmer 
and stir 3 minutes. Serve. 

Green Com — Select fresh tender corn. Boil I 5 
minutes. Send to the table at once in a napkin 
or covered dish. Tender corn is often toughened 
by cooking too long. 

Green Corn Pudding — Remove husks and silk 
from I dozen small ears of corn. Cut the kernels 
down fine and scrape cob. Turn the corn into Yl 
pt. hot milk, thickened with I tbsp. butter, I tbsp. 
flour, Yl teasp. sugar, '4 teasp. salt. Add I or 2 
beaten eggs. Stir well together. Pour into but- 
tered baking dish. Bake in moderate oven 30 
minutes. Sprinkle buttered crumbs over top and 
brown. Serve in baking dish. 

Corn Oyster* — To I pt. grated corn or canned 
corn mashed, add I or 2 eggs, 2 large grated 
crackers or Yl teacup flour. Beat well, season 
with salt and pepper. Drop by spoonfuls in hot 
fat. When brown, drain as fried oysters. Serve 
hot with jelly or maple syrup for breakfast, or for 
lunch with cold boiled ham.

POTATOES 

Potatoes — Potatoes are composed principally of 
starch and water. As they are lacking in protein 
they should be served with meat, fish or eggs. 
They give the necessary bulk to food. 

New Potatoes — Scrape until white, wash in cold 

and cook in boiling salted water about 30 min- 
utes; drain, shake dry over fire. Serve plain 
with butter, or pour over them a ^vhite sauce. 
This may be seasoned with chopped meat or pars- 
ley or grated cheese. 

Old or Winter Potatoes (Boiled Plain)— rPeel 

thin or scrape, soak in cold water, boil in salted 
water 45 minutes, or until they can be pierced with 
a fork; drain; or: Wash and boil w^ith skins on; 
when done, drain, set back uncovered to steam 
dry, skin while hot. Serve plain with salt and 
butter or brush over with butter and brown quickly 
under oven flame.

and beat to a snow white stiffness with 2 tbsp. 
butter, I teasp. salt, rich milk enough to moisten. 
Serve at once on hot dish. Stiff whites of eggs 
or grated cheese beaten in last add to the lightness 
and richness of the potatoes.

layer of sliced raw^ or boiled potatoes in greased 
baking dish and sprinkle with grated cheese and a 
little flour. Repeat until dish is nearly full. Pour 
milk over the whole, about Yl cup to every 3 pota- 
toes. Skim milk is good. Bake in a moderate oven 
until done. The length of time required depends 
upon whether the potatoes are raw or boiled and 
whether the baking dish used is deep or shallow. 
Boiled potatoes baked in a shallow dish will take 
only 20 minutes. Raw potatoes in a deep dish 
may take as much as I Yl hours. 

Baked Stuffed — Take 6 baked potatoes from oven 
when about done. Cut in two lengthwise or slice 
end off each w^ithout breaking skin and scoop out 
inside. Prepare as for mashed potatoes with 3 
tbsp. butter, Yl teasp. salt, '/g teasp. pepper, I tbsp. 
chopped parsley, V^ cup hot milk. Return mixture 
to potato shells, brush with butter or egg and 
brown in oven. 

French Fried Potatoes — Peel the raw potatoes, 
slice and lay in ice cold water I hour, put for a 
moment in hot w^ater, drain, w^ipe dry, place in 
a frying basket or large strainer and lower it into 
deep hot fat for about 10 minutes. Lift out w^hen 
brown, sprinkle salt over and serve at once. 

Hashed Browned — Make a white sauce of 2 tbsp. 
cream, 1 teasp. flour, 1 teasp. salt, 1 teasp. minced 
parsley, pepper; add chopped cooked potatoes.

BAKED POTATO DON'TS 

The Irishman claims that the only thing better 
than a good baked potato is two baked potatoes. 
Here are some baked potato don'ts: 

Don't have your oven too hot. 

Don't have different-sized potatoes. 

Don't delay in getting them into the oven — they 
will not hurry when the time is short. 

Don't fail to allow them from 45 minutes to an 
hour for a medium-sized (6 ounce) potato. 

Don't select potatoes that are too big. 

Don t put them into your oven dripping with 
cold water. 

Don't plan to serve them as a second course in 
a dinner; it is difficult to get them just right — use 
them with the first course in a lunch or supper.

Care of Bread — Bread boxes should be thoroughly washed and scalded and 
dried over the fire before each new baking. When dry do not leave box open. 
Keep dry old rolls or bread in an earthen crock; they should be ground and used 
for crumbing, etc. 

To Keep Bread Fresh — After baking bread let it cool, then put in paper bags 
and into bread jars. 

To keep bread and butter fresh when cut, place in a cool place and cover 
closely with a clean cloth that has been wrung out of cold water. 

To make old bread new, dampen it all over with milk, put in a hot oven about 
20 minutes. It is better to do this the day before it is used. 

When making bread boil I large potato until done, mash thoroughly and 
use along with the water it was boiled in. It makes lighter, finer bread, remains 
moist longer and makes one more loaf to each 3 qts. of flour. 

The Importance of Good Bread — (Farmers' Bulletin 81 7, on "How to Select 
Foods ") — Because bread is often really "the staff of life" it is very important to 
have it good. People's ideas may differ as to exactly how bread should taste or how 
it should be made, but in this country, all are agreed that yeast-raised bread should 
be light and spongy, with a crisp, tender, golden brown crust, and that it should be 
nutty and sweet in flavor. Heavy, soggy bread, when it is sw^allowed, forms 
tough lumps which the digestive organs cannot work upon properly, and, if eaten 
day after day, may do serious harm. Every housekeeper should try, therefore, to 
provide light, well-baked bread for her family. 

Flour should be kept in a cool, dry place away from dust and also away from foods 
which have strong odors as flour absorbs flavors easily. 

Yeast — (Farmers' Bulletin 807, on "Bread") — If yeast plants are well distributed 
throughout a mass of dough many bubbles with thin walls will be formed. If they are not 
well distributed there are likely to be no bubbles in some places and large bubbles with thick 
walls in others. 

The kinds of yeast most commonly used are compressed, dry, and liquid yeast. 

Compressed yeast is very convenient, for in this form the yeast plants are active 
snd ready to begin their work. However, it is not easy to keep it long in good condition 
and so is commonly purchased fresh each time it is needed. When in good condition it is 
soft and yet brittle and is the same color throughout, a creamy white. 

Dry yeast can be kept for a long time. It is, however, less active than compressed 
yeast, and for this reason is not convenient when the bread making must be hastened, but 
only in the long process or "sponge" method. 

Liquid yeast, like compressed yeast, is in active condition. It is easily made at home, 
and in a cool place can be kept for about two weeks.

208 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Sec. IV— Pt. 2— COOKING AND RECIPES 

Milk — (Farmers' Bulletin 807, on "Bread") — Whole or skim milk may be substi- 
tuted for part or all of the water used in making bread. It should be scalded thoroughly 
before use. When the long or overnight process is followed, it is well not to use milk in the 
sponge, for it is likely to turn sour. 

Fat — (Farmers' Bulletin 807, on "Bread") — Fat, if used, may be butter, lard, beef 
fat, cottonseed oil, or any other of the ordinary fats used in cooking. It should, however, 
be wholesome, of good quality, and in good condition. Bread is so little improved by the 
addition of fat that it is a mistake to run the slightest risk of injuring its flavor by using fat 
of questionable quality. 

Utensils — (Farmers' Bulletin 807, on "Bread") — The necessary utensils are mixing 
bowl, measuring spoons, measuring cup (of standard size, holding about half a pint), mix- 
ing spoon or knife, and baking pans. Utensils desirable under some circumstances, particu- 
larly w^hen several loaves are to be made, are bread mixer for kneading, molding board, 
bread raiser, and bread rack. 

Shaping the Loaves — When the dough has risen sufficiently, cut or tear it into the 
required number of loaves. Take each piece of dough in the hands and work it lightly in 
such a way as to stretch the underside, which is to become the top of the loaf. In forming 
the loaf, make no effort to fit it to the shape of the pan, for in rising it will fill out the cor- 
ners. Strive merely to form it into an oblong piece with a smooth surface. (Same Bulletin.) 

Baking — (Farmers' Bulletin 807, on "Bread") — Loaves made with I cupful of 
liquid each should be baked 50 minutes. They should begin to brown in about 15 minutes. 
After that time the temperature of the oven should be lowered so that the loaves will bake 
slcwly. The temperature should be 400 or 425 F. to begin with, should be increased to 
425 F., and then dropped gradually to about 380 F. The surest way to get these tem- 
peratures is by means of an oven thermometer or an oven gauge. In the absence of these 
the following test may be made: Put into the oven a small piece of white paper, a white 
cracker, or half a level teaspoon of flour spread in a layer Yn or '/g inch thick on a tin plate. 
If it becomes a light golden brown in 5 minutes, the oven is about right in temperature to 
begin the baking. 

If possible, pans should be so placed in the oven that the air will circulate around 
them. If they touch each other or the sides of the oven, the loaves will rise unevenly and be 
of unsightly shape. If the oven is crow^ded, it may be necessary to change the position of 
the pans occasionally to insure well-shaped loaves.

the sides of the bowl; grease the hands slightly. 
Knead a little and set aside to rise again (or one 
hour. With a good bread flour, the dough would 
treble its bulk in each rising. With a soft wheat 
flour, it should not rise much beyond twice its 
volume. Divide into portions, mold, and place in 
greased pans. Allow to rise until a light touch 
will make a slight dent. Bake 50 minutes. 

Short-Sponge Method (Same Bulletin) — Bread 
can be made during the day by what is known as 
the "short-sponge" method. All the ingredients 
are the same as for the "short or straight-dough" 
process, but only half of the flour is added at first. 
When this mixture, which is called a "sponge," is 
so light that it will fall at the slightest touch, it 
is ready for the addition of the rest of the flour. 

Overnight Sponge Method — Use the same pro- 
portions as for the short process, except in the 
case of the yeast, which should be '/g cake of 
compressed yeast or 2 tbsp. of liquid yeast for 
each loaf. Use water rather than milk. In the 
evening mix the yeast with water, salt, and half 
of the flour, and beat thoroughly. Cover and place 
at a temperature of 65 to 70 F., or that of an 
ordinary room. In the morning add the sugar 
and the rest of the flour and proceed as in the 
case of the short process. (Same Bulletin.) 

Overnight Straight-Dough Method (Same Bul- 
letin) Use the same ingredients as for the over- 
night sponge method, but put in all ingredients 
at night. If the following rules are observed, the 
bread is almost sure to be of good quality and to 
keep well: 

( I ) Keep everything clean, protect the flour 
from dust, and scald all liquid ingredients thor- 
oughly. 

(2) Keep the dough between 65 and 86 F., and 
do not allow it to stand longer than necessary. 

(3) See that the dough, when placed in the 
oven, has three times the bulk of the dough when 
first made. Dough made with 1 cupful of liquid 
will reach the top of a I |/2 qt. baking pan when 
it has tripled its bulk. 

(4) Bake 45 to 60 minutes at about 400 F. 

(5) Keep closely covered in a clean receptacle 
that is frequently scalded. 

Ash Cake (Corn Bread) — (Farmers' Bulletin, 
565, on "Corn-Meal") — I qt. corn-meal, 2 teasp. 
salt, I tbsp. lard or other shortening, boiling water. 

Scald the meal; add the salt and shortening, 
and when the mixture is cool form into oblong 
cakes, adding more water if necessary. Wrap the 
cakes in cabbage leaves or place one cabbage leaf 
under the cakes and one over them, and cover 
them with hot ashes. 

South Carolina Yeast Corn Bread — (Farmers' 
Bulletin, 565, on "Corn-Meal" — 1 J/^ qts. fine 



corn-meal, 2^ qts. wheat flour, 2 teasp. salt, I 
pint mashed sweet potatoes, I cake yeast. Or: 
25^2 "J'*- fi"* corn-meal, I J/2 qts. wheat flour, 2 
teasp. salt, I pint mashed sweet potatoes, I cake 
yeast. 

Mix I pint each of the corn-meal and the flour 
and add warm water enough to form a stiff batter. 
Add the yeast cake, mixed with a small amount of 
water. Keep this sponge in a warm place until 
it becomes light. Scald the meal with boiling water 
and as soon as it is cool enough add it to the 
sponge with the flour, potatoes, and salt. The 
dough should be just thick enough to knead with- 
out danger of its sticking to the board. Experi- 
ence will teach how much water to use to secure 
this end. Knead well and put in a warm place to 
rise. When it is light form into loaves, put into 
bread pans, and let it rise until its volume is 
doubled. Bake in a moderate oven. 

Apple Com Bread (Same Bulletin) — 2 cups 
white corn-meal, 2 tbsp. sugar, Y^ teasp. salt, I 
teasp. soda, I teasp. cream of tartar, I 2/3 cups 
milk, 3 tart apples, pared and sliced. 

Mix the dry ingredients, add the milk, and heat 
thoroughly. Add the apples. Pour into a well- 
buttered shallow pan and bake 30 minutes or 
longer in hot oven to soften the apples. 

This could be made with dried apricots cooked 
in the usual manner by soaking and cooking 
slowly and adding a little sugar. The juice may 
be used as sauce. 

This serves 6 or 8 people. 

Sour Milk Com Bread (Without Wheat) — 
(Same Bulletin) — 2 cups corn-meal, 2 cups sour 
milk, 2 tbsp. butter, 2 tbsp. white or brown sugar, 
I ^/i teasp. salt, 2 eggs, I teasp. soda, I tbsp. cold 
water. 

There are two ways of mixing this bread. By 
the first the meal, milk, salt, butter, and sugar are 
cooked in a double boiler for about 10 minutes. 
When the mixture is cool, the eggs are added, 
well beaten, and the soda dissolved in the water. 
By the other method all the dry ingredients, in- 
cluding the soda, are mixed together, and then the 
sour milk and eggs, well beaten, and the butter 
are added. If the second method is followed, the 
cold water is not needed. The bread should be 
baked in a shallow iron or granite pan for about 
30 minutes. 

Since the bread made by the first method is of 
much better texture, that method is to be pre- 
ferred, except in cases where there is not time for 
the necessary heating and cooling of the meal. 

Buttermilk may be substituted for the sour milk, 
in which case the butter should be increased 
slightly; or sour cream may be used and the butter 
omitted. 

This serves 6 people.

STALE BREAD 



(Farmers' Bulletin, 817, on "How to Select Food»") 
DISCUSSION 



It is generally admitted that more bread goes 
to waste in the average American home than al- 
most any other kind of food. This happens mainly 
because many housekeepers do not know \vhat to 
do with stale bread. Good fresh bread has a 
springy quality which disappears as it ages, prob- 
ably because the water in it gradually passes from 
the center of the loaf out through the crust, leav- 
ing the bread drier and more crumbly. Many per- 
sons think bread is better when it has dried out 
a little, say for 24 hours, but almost everyone 
agrees that really stale bread is too dry to eat with 
enjoyment. Bread that has been cut grows stale 
more quickly than the uncut loaf, and unless the 
housekeeper plans very carefully, she is likely to 
find her bread box full of hard, dry slices and ends 
of loaves which are of no use on the table. To 
avoid this waste she may do two things: ( I ) Treat 
the bread so it shall not be unappetizing and (2) 
use the stale bread in cooking. 

Toasting is the most common method for mak- 
ing stale or partly stale bread attractive, but it is 
by no means the only one. If partly stale bread 
IB put into a very hot oven for a few minutes it 
grows softer, probably because the heat tends to 
drive the water from the crust back into the 
crumb. Such warmed-over bread is not as soft 
and springy as fresh, but some persons find it 
very appetizing. A good plan, therefore, when 
bread has lost its freshness, is to cut off what will 
be needed at a meal and place the slices in a hot 
oven for a few ntinutes just before serving. In 
this way bread can be used on the table which 
would ordinarily be considered too stale. 

"Twice-baked Bread," which is cut bread placed 
in the warming oven, or in a pan on the back of the 
stove, and allowed to dry out very slowly until it 
is slightly brown and very crisp throughout, offers 



still another way of making stale bread attractive. 
If desired, this twice-baked bread may be crushed 
with a rolling pin and used like the ready-to-eat 
breakfast cereals; in some localities this dish has 
long been known under the name of rusks. The 
little fried cubes of bread called "croutons," which 
are served with soup, may be made with odds and 
ends of bread. To save time, bread simply broken 
into small pieces may be fried either in deep fat 
or in a pan (sauteed) and used for the same pur- 
pose. Sometimes bread crumbs are fried in a pan 
for use in a similar way as a seasoning or sauce 
for meat. French cooks frequently put pieces of 
stale bread in soups just long enough before serv- 
ing for them to soften; the well-known one called 
"crust in the pot" (croute au pot) is simply a thin 
soup with bread in it. 

There are many ways of using stale bread in 
cooking. Almost every good cook-book gives 
directions for preparing soft and dry crumbs for 
use in scalloped dishes, bread puddings, etc. The 
soft parts of the bread may be used in the place 
of flour or cornstarch for thickening soups, sauces, 
gravies, stewed tomatoes (either fresh or canned), 
etc. Bakers often use stale bread and dried, finely 
ground cake in place of part of the flour in making 
fancy breads, cakes, and cookies, and the house- 
keeper can often avoid waste by using them in 
this way in griddle-cakes, cakes, cookies, etc. 

Stale crackers serve many of the same uses as 
3tale bread. If they have lost their crispness, they, 
too, can usually be freshened by warming in the 
oven, and the fine crumbs may be used in the 
same way as dried bread crumbs. 

The texture of stale cake and cookies is not so 
easily improved by heating, but they may be dried, 
crushed, and used like bread crumbs wherever 
their flavor and texture allow. 



STALE BREAD RECIPES 
Showing How Bread Crumbs May Be Used Instead of Flour in Various Dishes 

Vegetable Skim Milk Soup — (Nearly all the materials used in this soup are those 
that are often thrown away — skim milk, the outside leaves of lettuce, and stale bread.) 

One quart skim milk, 1 slice stale bread, 2 ozs. of the outer leaves of lettuce (6 
large leaves), a few celery tips, or a thin slice onion, salt and pepper. 

Chop the vegetables finely. A convenient way, particularly if the soup is being 
made in large quantities, is to use a food grinder and to put the bread through it with the 
vegetables to catch the juice. Cook the finely chopped vegetables and the bread in the 
milk in the double boiler for about 20 minutes. Season.

U. S. FOOD ADMINISTRATION BREAD RECIPES 

Using Barley, Rye, Rice and Potatoes 



Barley Yeast Bread — Introductory statement : 
Bread may be made using wheat flour and barley 
flour in mixtures containing from 33 1-3 to 50 per 
cent, barley flour. The bread containing one- 
third barley flour is light, palatable, and of espe- 
cially pleasant flavor. A larger percentage pro- 
duces a heavier, darker bread of pronounced barley 
flavor. The manipulation for this bread is the 
same as for wheat bread. The conditions and 
time for baking are also the same. The loaf is 
smaller. 

1 cup milk and water, or water (8 oz.), I tbsp. 
sugar (J/2 oz. ), I tbsp. fat {Yl oz. ). I teasp. salt 
(!4 oz.), I 1/6 cups barley flour (4 oz.), 2 1/3 
cups wheat flour (9 1/3 oz.), Yz cake compressed 
yeast {]/4 oz. ). 

Soften the yeast in part of the liquid. Com- 
bine ingredients. Mix into a dough. Knead and 
let rise to double original bulk. Knead again. Put 
in the pan, and when again double in bulk bake 
about 45 minutes. 

Rye Yeast Bread — Introductory statements: Com- 
mercial rye breads are made of a niixture of wheat 
and rye flours, known in the trade as 50-50. Rye 
flour has much less expansion than wheat flour; 
hence the loaves are smaller. The manipulation 
is the same throughout as for wheat bread. 

1 cup milk and water, or water (8 oz. ), 1 tbsp. 
fat (J/2 oz. ), 2 tbsp. sugar (1 oz. ), I teasp. salt 
( J4 oz.), 2J4 cups rye flour (7 oz.), 2J4 cups 
wheat flour (9 oz. ), J/J cake compressed yeast 
(J/^ oz. ), 2 tbsp. water (I oz. ). 

Combine the ingredients. Mix into dough and 
knead. Let rise until double original bulk. Knead 
again. When again double bulk, bake about 45 
minutes. 

Rice Yeast Bread — Rice has many other uses, as 
in puddings, etc., and is much in demand among 
the allies. Therefore its use should not be stressed 
in connection with emergency breads. 

Cooked rice, combined with wheat flour, makes 
delicious muffins and yeast bread. There are 
many ways of cooking the rice. The basic prin- 
ciples may be stated as follows: First, cook the 
rice so as to conserve all mineral matter and other 
soluble products. 

Method: After tlie rice is thoroughly washed 
it should be put in a thick iron kettle or stoneware 
baking dish, cold water added so that the water 
stands ^ of an inch to an inch clear above the rice. 
A heavy or weighted cover should be used to seal 
the dish. Cook slowly over direct heat or in the oven 
until all the water has been absorbed and the grains 
are soft and steam escapes from the vessel. This 



is the Japanese method. The second method, more 
frequently used in the United States, is to use a 
very large amount of boiling water to a small 
amount of rice, the rice being added slowly 
enough not to stop the boiling. The water is 
boiled briskly 20 minutes, or until the kernels are 
tender. Then it is drained in a colander or 
strainer, set on the back of the stove, or put in a 
slightly warm oven or in a pan over hot water, to 
dry off a bit. There results a fluffy mass of large, 
plump grains, each perfectly distinct in itself, in- 
stead of the gummy mush so often served as 
boiled rice. 

The rice yeast bread is very v^hite in color, is 
moister that wheat bread, and keeps moist longer. 
It is handled in much the same manner as wheat 
bread. The first dough, however, is much stiffer, 
and after once rising the light dough is so soft that 
it cannot be kneaded with the hands. It should be 
well stirred with a strong spoon and placed in the 
pans, looking much like a stiff drop batter. After 
baking, the upper crust is less smooth than that of 
our familiar wheat flour loaf. 

Proportions and directions: These amounts make 
two or three small loaves of bread. 

Rice Yeast Bread — J/2 cup milk and water, or 
water (4 oz. ), 4 tbsp. sugar (2 oz. ), 4 tbsp. fat 
(2 oz.), 1 I/2 teasp. salt (^ oz.), 7 cups boiled 
rice, 8 cups flour (32 oz.), ]/i cake compressed 
yeast ( J/^ oz. ), J/^ cup warm water (2 oz.). 

Scald liquid if milk is used. Pour over fat, sugar, 
and salt. Cool and add yeast, moistened in J/^ cup 
warm water. Add rice and flour and knead. After 
second rising, bake 45 minutes. 

Potato Yeast Bread — Introductory statements: 
Boiled potatoes, mashed and combined with %vheat 
flour, may be used in making a bread of good 
flavor and texture. The potato bread is slightly 
darker in color than patent flour bread and is also 
somewhat more moist. It is relished by persona 
who do not care for any but so-called "white 
bread.'* Two manipulations are satisfactory. 
Either all the flour may be added in the first mix- 
ture, making a dough vsrhich is very stiff and diffi- 
cult to knead, or a part of the flour may be reserved 
and added with the second kneading. In either 
case, the dough is soft at the second handling, but 
after baking it produces a satisfactory loaf. 

The following amounts make 3 loaves of bread: 

Potato Yeast Bread — Yl cup milk and water, 
or water (4 oz.), 4 tbsp. sugar (2 oz.), 4 tbsp. 
fat (2 oz.), I J/2 teasp. salt ( f^ oz. ), 4 cups boiled 
potatoes, 8 cups flour (32 oz.), J/^ cake com-

Cook oatmeal, using one part oatmeal to two 
parts water. A larger proportion of water makes 
too soft a mush and gummy muffins. Mix milk, 
oatmeal, egg, and melted fat. Add dry ingredi- 
ents after sifting them together. Bake 25 to 30

FOOD ADMINISTRATION CORN AND OAT MEAL YEAST BREAD RECIPES 

Proportions and Directions: — All proportions are for one loaf. The amount 
of yeast provides for a very short process — 3' 2 to 4 hours. One-half the yeast 
suggested will make bread in 5 hours. 

One cake of dry yeast used as a starter should produce yeast for 6 loaves. 
In all cases the amount of liquid should be equal to that added with the compressed 
yeast in the recipe given. 



Corn-Meal Yeast Bread — (I loaf); \]/i cups 
milk and water, or water (10 oz. ), 2 tbsp. sugar 
(I oz.), I tbsp. fat (Yz oz.), 2 teasp. salt ( J4 
oz.), 2/3 cup corn-meal (31/3 oz.), 2 1/3 cups 
flour (9 1/3 oz.), |/2 cake compressed yeast ( '/^ 
oz.), '/4 cup warm water (2 oz.). 

Add sugar, fat, and salt to liquid and bring to 
boiling point. Add corn-meal slowly, stirring 
constantly until all is added. Remove from fire, 
cool mixture, and add compressed yeast softened 
in ^/4 cup warm water. Add 2 1/3 cups flour 
and knead. Let rise until about double its bulk, 
knead again, and put in the pan. When light, 
bake in a moderate oven for at least one hour. 

In mixing the dough, the flour and corn-meal 
are to be used as separate ingredients, because 
the corn-meal must be scalded, or a grainy bread 
results. When the corn-meal mixture is removed 



from the stove, the housewife will doubt her 
ability to add the amount of flour called for. The 
flour will work in, as required, but a stiffer, 
stickier dough than that to which she is accus- 
tomed will result.

CEREAL FOODS 

(From "How to Select Foods," U. S. Department of Agriculture) 

Where economy is especially needed cereals (the lower-priced ones, of course) 
should be used as freely as they can be without making the diet one-sided. In this they 
differ from such higher-priced foods as milk, meat, fruits, and vegetables, which, in case 
of need, must be cut down so far as they safely can be. To encourage the use of cereals 
housekeepers should — 

(a) Provide the very best of bread; that is, bread that is well flavored, 
light, of good texture, and well baked. 

(b) Take particular pains in cooking and salting the lower-priced break- 
fast cereals. The same rule applies to such foods as hominy, boiled rice, or macar- 
oni, commonly served with meat or other protein-rich food at luncheon, dinner, or 
supper. 

(c) Remember that, though large quantities of cereal foods may not seem 
attractive if served alone, they may be very appetizing if combined with small 
amounts of more highly flavored or seasoned foods. A well-seasoned soup may 
lead to the eating of a large quantity of bread. A little savory meat or fish (salted 
or smoked), or a small quantity of cheese, may be used to flavor a fairly large dish 
of rice or macaroni. 

This bulletin discusses the way in which cereal foods may be wisely used in the diet. 

The term "cereal foods" may mean: (1) The kernels of corn, oats, rice, rye, 
wheat, etc.; (2) the flours, meals, breakfast foods, starches, etc., manufactured from them; 
or (3) bread, crackers, cakes, pastry, etc., in which they form an important part. It will 
be easier to understand their use in the diet if these three general forms are borne in mind. 

Kind of Cereals — The most common cereals are wheat, rye, corn, oats, and rice. 
They differ somewhat in appearance, taste, and food value, but all have many features in 
common. 

The most abundant food material in cereals is starch, which serves the body as fuel. 
This makes up nearly three-quarters of most grains. The next most abundant material is 
protein, which supplies nitrogen for tissue building. This makes up about one-eighth of 
the grain. There is also a little fat, particularly in corn and oats; it is found chiefly in the 
germ. Another important material is the "roughage" or cellulose, which is most abundant 
in the skin of the grain and which gives bulk to the diet. The kernels also contain actually 
small, but relatively high, proportions of mineral matters needed for body building and 
other purposes and other substances very important for regulating body processes. 

The protein is not alike in all kinds of cereals. Fart of that in wheat is a tough, 
elastic sort, called gluten. It is because of this gluten, which can be expanded into air bub- 
bles, that light, porous bread can be made from wheat. Rye is most like w^heat in the 
character of its gluten, though light, porous bread can not be made from it alone. Barley, 
buckwheat, corn, oats, and rice are so lacking in gluten that they cannot be raised by yeast. 

Prepared Cereals — By prepared cereals are meant such manufactured goods as flours 
and meals, cracked wheat, steamed and rolled oats, puffed or flaked grains of all kinds, 
macaroni and other pastes, cornstarch, etc. They may or may not contain all of the orig- 
inal grain, and for this reason they differ more widely than the grains themselves in appear- 
ance, composition and flavor. The cooking which some of them undergo during manufac- 
ture also causes changes. Of course, unless something ig added to them, they contain no 
food material not present in the grains from which they are made.

2 I 8 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Sec. IV— Pt. 2— COOKING AND RECIPES 

Prepared cereals differ so much in form that their appearance gives little idea of 
the amount of nourishment they yield. For instance, the amount of flour which will fill 
a cup weighs 4 ounces; that of rice 8 or 9ounces; and that of flaked breakfast cereal, 
hardly half an ounce; and it is this weight rather than bulk or volume which indicates food 
value. Such differences in weight and volume must be remembered by those who wish to 
buy their food as cheaply as possible. Some breakfast foods retail at 48 cents a pound ( 1 5 
cents for a 5 -ounce package) ; others cost 5 or 6 cents a pound. The cheapest ones are 
usually those sold in bulk. The housekeeper, by grinding her own wheat, can get a cereal 
breeikfast food for a still smaller sum. When wheat sells for $2 a bushel the cost per 
pound is between 3 and 4 cents. This wheat can be prepared by washing, drying, and then 
grinding in an ordinary coffee mill. 

One of the important differences between these preparations depends on whether 
or not any of the outer coating of the kernel has been left in. This coating consists mainly 
of bulky cellulose, but it also contains a large part of the important tissue-forming mineral 
compounds and body-regulating substances found in the grain. When the bran is left in, 
the preparation is more bulky and contains more of some food elements. On the other 
hand, it does not always keep as well and (in the case of flour) does not make as light 
bread, and is not so thoroughly digested. Evidently, then, the choice of cereal foods should 
depend on the purpose they are to serve. If bread or breakfast cereals are used as the chief 
part of a meal or of a diet which does not include much of vegetables, fruits, milk and eggs, 
and which, therefore, may be lacking in bulk and mineral salts, it is well to choose the 
bran-containing preparations. This should be especially remembered in considering the diet 
of children, for they need more body-building mineral compounds and body-regulating 
substances than adults. If, on the other hand, the diet in general is varied and if flour is 
to be used for cakes, pastry, and general cooking, white flour is more useful than coarser 
whole wheat or Graham flour. 

Dishes Made of Cereals — These include porridge and cereal mush, breads, cakes, 
puddings, pies, etc. There are even greater differences among this group of cereal foods 
as they appear on the table than among those from which they are prepared, because they 
are made in so many different ways and combined with so many different things. The cook- 
ing has made them pleasanter to eat. It is commonly believed that they are more readily 
digested cooked than raw. 

Ordinarily more or less water or some other liquid is added in cooking cereals, and 
the water that they thus take up makes them much bulkier and at the same time more dilute. 
One cupful of uncooked oatmeal or rice, for instance, cooked with three cupfuls of water 
gives over four cupfuls when boiled, but the water, which chiefly causes the difference, 
does not give to the entire four cupfuls any more body fuel or building material than was 
in the original cupful. Hence we must not judge the food value of cooked cereals merely 
by the size of the finished dish, but must remember that the raw food material has been 
diluted, so that a cupful cooked may have only a quarter the food value of a cupful of the 
raw grain. The body-building protein, which makes up about one-eighth of the raw grain, 
makes up only about one fiftieth of the weight of cooked porridge. 

If the cereal were cooked in skim milk, which itself is rich in protein, this valuable 
material would be taken up by the cereal and the cooked dish would be by that much more 
nutritious than if cooked in water. A cupful of rice cooked slowly in a double boiler can 
be made to take up six cupfuls of skim milk, and the amount of tissue-building material 
the cooked dish contains is about four times as great as that of the rice alone. 

In the same way the total food value of bread, cakes, etc., depends on all the ma- 
terials from which they are made. If bread is mixed with water, its food value is about 
like that of the flour which goes into the loaf, for little besides water is added, and almost 
nothing is taken away in making the bread. Measured pound for pound, the bread has a 



CLASS 1 7— BREAD — CEREAL FOODS 2 1 9 

lower food value than the flour, because it is moister, owing to the water added in mixing 
the dough. If skim milk is used in the place of water in mixing bread, this makes the 
bread richer in body-building material. If a little sugar and fat are added, these make it 
more useful as body fuel. A cake made with two eggs provides more body-building ma- 
terial than one made with one egg, and if nuts and raisins are added, these add to the food 
value as well as to the flavor. 

How Much Cereal Food Should be Used? — Cereal food of one kind or another 
forms a large part of almost every wholesomeand economical diet. As a general rule, the 
greater the part played by cereals the cheaper the diet. Up to a certain point one may 
cut down the quantity of meat, etc., eggs, butter, sugar, fruits, and vegetables used and sub- 
stitute cereal foods, but there is a limit beyond which this can not be safely done. 

Breakfast Cereals — Next to their use in bread, cakes, etc., in this country, the most 
common way of using the cereals for food is in the form of the so-called breakfast foods. 
Sometimes, as in the case of rice, cracked wheat, and old-fashioned or "Scotch" oatmeal, 
the grains are simply husked and perhaps slightly crushed before being cooked. Some- 
times meals are used, as in com meal mush. Sometimes the grains are ground rather finely 
and the outside parts sifted out, as in farina. In other cases, as in the rolled-oat prepara- 
tions, the grain is cleaned, partially cooked by steam, and then run between rollers, which 
flatten it out. In still other preparations the partly cooked cereal is ground into fine, granu- 
lar form, or pressed into thin flakes which are baked crisp, or the whole grains are cooked 
under pressure so that they puff or pop up somewhat as does popped com, which may be 
used as a breakfast cereal as well as in other ways. Many of the devices used in preparing 
such breakfast foods are patented, and the products are often sold under proprietary names 
which may or may not suggest how the grains have been treated. What with all these 
methods of preparations, the list of varieties on the market is a long one, and the range 
of cost is great, especially when judged by the amount of food material actually supplied 
by a given quantity. All are wholesome foods. 

As has been shown, one can not judge the real cheapness or deamess of different 
kinds merely by the price paid for a package of a given size. Housekeepers who wish to be 
economical should note the net weight, which the law now requires to be marked on every 
package, and from this and the price reckon how much it costs per pound of material. 
They will find that, judged in this way, the simple flours and meals and the uncooked cereals 
(cracked wheat, coarse hominy or samp, unsteamed oatmeal, etc.) are usually the cheapest. 
When a preparation (steam-cooked oats, for example) can be bought either in package or 
in bulk, the cost of the package goods is usually, and quite justly, a little higher. Each 
housekeeper must decide for herself whether the greater convenience and attractiveness of 
the package goods is worth the difference in cost. The larger her family is, and the more 
good storage space she has, the greater will probably be the advantage of buying in bulk. 
If she decides to do this, she should be careful to get cereals which have been kept in 
clean, closed bins or bags and to keep them as carefully after they reach her home. 

Plain, uncooked cereals (cracked wheat, coarse hominy or samp, unsteamed oatmeal, 
etc.) usually cost less than the partially cooked preparations and the partially cooked ones 
less than the ready-to-eat kinds, as seems reasonable since fuel and labor are used in the 
factory where they are made. More or less fuel and labor are also needed to prepare 
cereals in the home, and a wise housekeeper reckons with these in deciding ■which kind is 
most truly economical in her own case. The coarse, uncooked ones need longer cooking 
than the partially cooked kinds, w^hile the ready-to-eat kinds need no cooking, or only 
enough to make them warm and crisp. In a household where a coal fire is kept in the 
range all day no more fuel and not much more work are required for the long, slow cooking 
of cracked wheat or "Scotch" oatmeal than for factory cooked brands; or where a fireless 



220 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Sec. IV— Pt. 2— COOKING AND RECIPES 



cooker is used such cereals may be easily and cheaply cooked. Where gas, electricity, or 
liquid fuel is used, and it is a matter of economy to plan for as short a use of the stove as 
possible, it may be cheaper to use steam cooked ones. In light housekeeping the conven- 
ience of the ready-to-eat preparations often more than compensates for their high cost. The 
pleasant variety given by the use of cereals manufactured in the more elaborate ways may 
seem to the housekeeper to be worth a few cents extra. It is worth remembering, however, 
that bread and milk, rusks and milk, and crackers and milk all have much the same food 
value as breakfast foods and milk, and often furnish a convenient and inexpensive variety. 

There are several practical points to remember in cooking cereals. One is that there 
is more danger of not cooking them enough than of cooking them too much. Uncooked cereal 
preparations, like cracked wheat and coarse samp, need several hours' cooking, and are 
often improved by being left on the back of the stove or in the fireless cooker overnight. 
Cereals partially cooked at the factory, such as the rolled or fine granular preparations, 
should be cooked fully as long as the directions on the package suggest. 

Flavoring is also an important part of cooking cereals. The flavor most commonly 
added is salt. Such added flavor is perhaps less necessary in some of the ready-to-eat 
kinds which have been browned at the factory and have thus gained the pleasant flavor 
which also appears in the crust of bread and cake or in toast, but in the plain boiled cereals 
or mushes the careful use of salt in cooking them may make all the difference between an 
appetizing and an unpalatable dish. A good general rule is 1 level teaspoonful of salt to 
each quart of water used in cooking the cereal. 

Milk, cream, butter, sugar, or syrup are often added to breakfast cereals when they 
are eaten and make them more palatable to most persons. The materials also add to the 
food value of the whole dish. 

Cereal Left-Overs — Remnants of cereal breakfast foods may often be utilized to make 
palatable dishes, to thicken soups or other foods, and in similar ways. For instance, small 
quantities of cooked cereal left over from a meal can be molded in cups and reheated for 
later use by setting the cups in boiling water. Another way to economize cereal mushes is 
to add hot water to any mush left over so as to make it very thin. It can then easily be 
added to a new supply. The practice of frying the left-overs of boiled hominy or of corn 
meal mush is as old as the settlement of this country, and the nursery song about the "bag 
pudding the queen did make" from King Arthur's barley meal shows us that for centuries 
other cereal puddings have been treated in the same way. In so-called oatmeal oysters, left- 
over cereal is dipped in eggs and crumbs and fried. The use of left-over rice and other 
cereals in croquettes, puddings, and so on is too well known to need more than mention. 

Cold Cooked Farina or similar cereal may be utilized in the following ways: The 
second recipe is less economical because of the use of egg and more milk. 

Farina Pudding No. 1 — One cup cold, cooked farina, Yz cup milk, 1/3 cup sugar, 
1/2 cup seeded raisins, J/g teaspoon cinnamon, a speck of ground cloves. 
Bake until brown, or heat on top of the stove. 

No. 2 — One cup cold, cooked farina, 1 tablespoon cornstarch, 1 egg, 1 cup milk, 
1/3 cup sugar, Yz cup seeded raisins, J/g teaspoon cinnamon, a speck of ground cloves. 

Bake in a medium oven until brown, or heat on top of the stove. Dried figs or dates 
or stewed fruit may be substituted for the raisins in either of these puddings. 

Boiled Rice and Pearl Barley are often used in soup, and there is no reason why small 
quantities of coarse samp or any other cereal which will keep its shape fairly well, should 
not be used up in the same way. Similarly, remnants of macaroni broken into small pieces 
may be used in the place of vermicelli or other special soup pastes. Such practices serve 



CLASS i 7— BREAD— CEREAL FOODS 221 

the double purpose of using material which would otherwise be wasted and of giving a little 
variety to a simple diet by inexpensive means. 

Home Ground Wheat Cereal — In many places good, clean, whole wheat can be 
obtained quite as easily and cheaply as the common cereal preparations. It is possible to 
grind this in a mill like an ordinary coffee grinder so that it is as fine as old-fashioned cracked 
wheat, or even to a meal fine enough for bread making. When coarsely ground, such home- 
ground wheat makes an excellent breakfast cereal. Bread can be made entirely of the home- 
ground meal, but it is lighter and more delicate in flavor if half ordinary flour and half wheat 
meal are used. Grinding the grain, of course, takes time, and such home products are not 
recommended to take the place of others entirely. Occasionally, however, and especially 
when bran is needed in the diet they may furnish a wholesome variety at low cost. 

If other cereals cost less than wheat flour, the cost of bread may be lessened by using 
some of them in place of part of the flour. It has been found that good yeast bread can 
be made with corn meal, rice, oatmeal, potatoes, etc., in place of at least one-third of the 
flour.

jelly roll and cut in small pieces. Put in a pan, 
flat side down, let rise; bake in hot oven. 

Parker House Rolls (Farmers' Bulletin No. 807, 
U. S. Dept. of Agri., on "Bread") — Two cups milk, 
3 tbsp. butter, 2 tbsp. sugar, I teasp. salt, I cake 
compressed yeast, flour. 

Put the butter, sugar, and salt in a mixing 
bowl. Scald the milk and pour it into the bowl. 
When it is lukewarm, add the yeast, mixing it 
writh a little of the liquid first. Add 3 cups of 
flour, beat thoroughly, cover, and let the dough 
rise until it doubles its bulk. Cut down the 
dough and add flour gradually until the mixture 
can be molded without sticking either to the hand 
or to the bowl. Let it rise again until about twice 
its original bulk and roll it on a floured board and 
cut it with a biscuit cutter. Brush the pieces 
over with fat, crease each piece through the cen- 
ter with a knife, and fold it over. Let it rise again 
and bake in a hot oven about I 5 minutes.

Bake 1 5 to 20 minutes. 

Potato Rolls (Farmers' Bulletin No. 807, on 

"Bread," U. S. Dept. of Agri.) Very palatable 

rolls can be made from a similar mixture of boiled 
potatoes and flour by adding fat and sugar. The 
following proportions will yield about I doz. small 
rolls: 

8 oz. boiled and peeled potatoes, 6 oz. or I Yi 
cups sifted flour, Yl cake compressed yeast, J^ 
level teasp. salt, 2 tbsp. lukewarm water, milk, 
or cream, 2 tbsp. sugar, 2 tbsp. butter. 

Boil, peel, and mash the potatoes as directed 
for bread making. Add to this the salt, the 
yeast, rubbed smooth and mixed with the water, 
or other liquid, and, lastly, 2 tbsp. flour. Set 
this mixture to rise at about 86' F., and allow it 
to rise till a touch will cause it to fall. Add to 
this sponge the butter, the sugar, and the re- 
mainder of the flour, and, if necessary, enough 
more flour to make a very stiff dough. Knead 
thoroughly until a smooth dough has been formed 
which is no longer sticky. Set back to rise again, 
and, when the dough has trebled in volume, knead 
lightly, form into small balls, and place, not too 
close together, in greased pans. Let rise until 
double in volume and bake 20 minutes in a mod- 
erately hot oven (about 400- F. ). 

Cinnamon Rolls — Put a baking powder mix- 
ture on floured board and roll out to Ya inch in 
thickness. Brush over with melted butter, then 
sprinkle with a mixture of 2 tbsp. sugar, Yl teasp. 
cinnamon, 1/3 cup raisons cut in small pieces, and 
2 tbsp. chopped nut meats. Roll like a jelly roll 
and cut into pieces I inch in thickness. Put on 
buttered tin cut side up and bake in hot oven 
I 5 minutes. 

Christmas Rolls — Add I cake yeast dissolved 
in warm water to 2 cupfuls scalded milk, and stir 
in 3 cups flour. Let rise till spongy, then add 
Yz cup melted butter, Yl cup sugar, 2 eggs, I 
tbsp. powdered cardamon seeds and flour to

knead; let rise till double its size, shape into 8- 
inch strips and fold into rings, or tie into knots; 
brush over with beaten egg white diluted with a 
little water and sprinkle with a mixture of sugar, 
chopped nuts and shredded candied cherries. 
Bake in moderate oven. 

Bread Sticks — Ordinary bread dough can be 
used. When the dough is light, cut pieces from 
the side and roll under the hands to the length 
of your pan and thickness of a lead pencil. Let 
rise until light. Bake in hot oven and when 
nearly done, brush white of an egg over them. 

Oliver Twists — Roll a piece of light bread 
dough into a thin sheet about J4 inch thick and 
cut into narrow strips about 8 inches long; twist, 
put on greased pan and let stand 1 5 minutes. 
Fry in deep hot fat until they puff light and turn 
a golden brown. Sprinkle with sugar and serve 
hot. 

Buns — Stir to a thick batter I cup yeast, I cup 
sugar, and 3 cups milk and let rise; then add I 
cup sugar, I teasp. soda, Yl teasp. nutmeg, and 



1 cup butter, I cup currants. Knead until thor- 
oughly mixed; let rise until double its size. Shape, 
brush with melted butter, cover and rise till 
light. Bake in quick oven 20 or 25 minutes. 

Crumpets Put 1 teasp. sugar, Yi teasp. salt, 

and 3 tbsp. melted butter in a mixing bowl, add 

2 cups scalded milk. When lukewarm, add Yi 
cake yeast; when yeast is thoroughly dissolved, 
add 3 cups flour slowly, beating constantly. Let 
stand in a warm place 2 or 3 hours. Bake in 
greased muffin rings on a hot griddle. Fill pans 
half full. 

Prune Kringles — Into 1 lb. dough, knead I 
tbsp. each of butter and sugar. Chop 6 or 8 
prunes, mix with 4 tbsp. sugar. Shape the 
dough into sticks about the size of little finger, 
then roll in the prunes and bake in oblong rings. 

Sugar Kringles are made in the same way, using 
instead of the prunes I doz. blanched and chopped 
almonds; roll the sticks smaller, make oblong 
rings with one end crossing at the middle to the 
opposite side.

In making biscuit handle the dough as little as possible; do all the mixing 
with a spoon. 

Biscuits will bake much quicker if put on top of the stove in a skillet. This 
is especially convenient in the summer time, as it makes so much less heat. 

With the increasing use of buttermilk by doctor's orders, there has come 
back in some measure the practice of using it in cooking. Cakes and biscuits are 
delicious prepared with buttermilk. Use one and one-half more buttermilk than 
the meal or flour, mix thoroughly and when smooth add a salt spoon of soda or 
more if a larger quantity of cakes are to be made. Cakes can be made in this way 
with white flour, buckwheat or rye meal. Always use enameled ware for the mix- 
ing, as the acid of the buttermilk easily affects metal.

quently. Mix the peanut butter, water, and salt, 
and heat. While this mixture is hot, stir in the 
meal, which also should be hot. Beat thoroughly. 
The dough should be of such consistency that it 
can be dropped from a spoon. Bake in smalt 
cakes in an ungreased pan. This makes 1 6 bis- 
cuits, each of which contains 1 /6 oz. of protein. 

Parched Corn-Meal Biscuits, Frosted — (Farm- 
ers' Bulletin, 565, on "Corn-Meal," U. S. Dept. 
of Agri.) — Cover the biscuits prepared according

oven till lightly browned. 

Griddle Cakes — I teasp. butter added to griddle 
or batter cakes will keep them fron\ sticking to 
the griddle; it is much better than putting it on 
the griddle, where it burns and fills the house 
with smoke. Turn the griddle often to keep heat 
even. Let each cake bake until full of holes and 
dry at the rim; turn only once.

balls. 

Indian Meal Doughnuts (Farmers' Bulletin, 

565, on "Corn-Meal," U. S. Dept. of Agri.) In 

making doughnuts there is a decided advantage 
in substituting corn-meal for part of the flour, for 
doughnuts so made are much more likely to be 
tender than those made with wheat flour alone.

In making cake use only the best of material. Have all utensils ready; an 
earthen bowl, a wooden spoon for mixing, a half-pint measuring cup, a dover beater 
for egg yolks, a wire egg whip for the whites and a flour sifter for dry ingredients. 

All measurements are used level. Dry ingredients should be sifted before 
measuring. Sift flour and baking powder after measuring two or three times be- 
fore using. 

Never grease pans w^hen baking sponge or angel food cake. Large loaf 
cakes or fruit cakes should be baked in pans lined with greased paper. For other 
cakes the pan should be greased, using cold lard or butter, dusted over ^vith flour. 

To remove cake from pans, invert pans as soon as taken from the oven into a wire 
netting. If cake sticks to the pan turn upside down and put a damp cloth over the bottom 
for a few minutes. 

To keep cake from burning, sprinkle salt on the bottom of the oven. 

The oven should be ready. The tests are: If a piece of white paper turns a deep 
yellow in 5 minutes the oven is right for cakes with butter; if it turns a light yellow in 5 
minutes it is right for sponge cake. 

To Frost Cake — When cooked frostings are used the cake may be spread when hot or 
cold ; when uncooked frostings are used it is best to spread when warm. 

To spread icing smoothly on cake dip the icing knife frequently into hot vrater. 
When making icing which requires a great deal of beating use a wide mouth pitcher, straight 
from the bottom up, just the right height for the egg beater. Break the whites of the eggs 
into the pitcher, beat until stiff; cook the syrup and gradually pour on the beaten whites 
and stir vigorously with a long spoon. The pitcher is easy to hold and the icing pours 
evenly over the cakes. The pitcher is also good to use for waffles and griddle cake batter. 



SUGGESTIONS for CAKE MAKING 

(Iowa State College of Agriculture) 

1 . Measure or weigh out the exact quantities of all the ingredients to be 
used before beginning to mix the cake. 

2. Sift the flour before measuring. 

3. Add leavening agents to the measured sifted flour. Sift together be- 
fore adding to cake liquids. 

4. Have pans buttered and floured or lined with plain white buttered paper. 

5. Break the eggs into a small bowl, separating the whites from the yolks 
when necessary. 

6. Beat the white of the eggs just before adding the flour to the cake, 
then at the last, fold in the beaten whites. 

7. Test the oven just before mixing the cake. 

229 



230 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Sec. IV— Pt. 2— COOKING AND RECIPES 



MATERIALS 

The choicest materials are necessary: 

1. The fats must be sweet and pure. 

2. Fresh eggs. 

3. Fine granulated sugar. 

4. Choice nuts, fruits and flavorings. 

5. Pastry flour or a fine quality of bread flour 
or combination of bread flour and corn starch. 
(Use I part corn starch to 7 parts bread flour, 
or to make one cup of pastry flour use 2 tbsp. 
corn starch plus 14 tbsp. of bread flour.) 

DIRECTIONS FOR BAKING CAKE 

Sponge cake 40-50 minutes, 340 degrees F. 

Butter cake 40-50 minutes, 380 degrees F. 

Small cakes and layer cakes 25-30 minutes, 

425 to 450 degrees F. 

Molasses drop cakes — 25-30 minutes, 380 de- 
grees F, 

EXPERT INTERPRETATION OF OVEN 
TEMPERATURE 

Slow (meringues and custards) — 250 to 300 
degrees F. 

Slow to medium — 300 to 350 degrees F. 

Medium (bread. 20 oz. loaf) — 350 to 360 
degrees F. 

Medium to hot — 360 to 400 degrees F. 

Hot — 400 to 450 degrees F. 

Very hot — 450 to 500 degrees F. 

DIVISION OF TIME 

First quarter Rise, not brown. 

Second quarter — Rise, and begin to brown. 
Third quarter — Brown, not rise. 
Fourth quarter — Neither rise nor brown, grow 
firm and shrink away from pan. 

POINTS OF A GOOD CAKE 

A good butter cake is smooth on top and evenly 
browned. Bursting and crackling indicate too 
much flour or too rapid baking. 

Inside of loaf should be slightly moist but not 

sticky. 

Cake should be fine grained and of uniform 

lightness. 

Coarse grained cakes indicate a lack of beat- 
ing, too low an oven temperature, or too much 
baking powder. 

SOME CONVENIENT SUBSTITUTES 
Baking Powder 

Use 2 level teasp. baking powder for each cup 
of flour if no eggs are used. 

When eggs are used, the baking powder is 
decreased. One egg replaces from !4 to Vi teasp. 
baking powder. 



Soda 

Use I teasp. soda to 2 cups thick sour milk. 

Use J/^ teasp. soda to 2 tbsp. lemon juice. 

When sour milk is to be substituted for sweet 
milk, use Y^ teasp. soda to each cup of sour 
milk for sweetening, then use amount of baking 
powder (less I teasp. for each cup of milk used) 
given in recipe. 

Sugar 
Brown or powdered sugar should be substituted 
for granulated sugar by weight instead of meas- 
ure. 

Chocolate and Cocoa 

Cocoa should be substituted for chocolate by 
weight instead of by measure. 

When cocoa is substituted for chocolate, butter 
('/2 tbsp, butter for each oz. or '/^ cup cocoa) 
should be added. 

Bread and Pastry Flour 

To change bread flour to pastry flour, use 2 
level tbsp. cornstarch to replace 2 level tbsp. 
flour in each cupful. 

FaU 

Other fats may be substituted for butter and 
the cost of the cake considerably reduced. 

Equivalent of ^^ Cup Butter — Yl eup chicken 
fat; Yl eup lard, less I tbsp.; Yl eup lard sub- 
stitute, less I j/2 tbsp.; '/^ eup butter, plus 3 tbsp. 
lard; Y^ <^UP butter, plus 3 tbsp. lard substitute; 
Yl cup cottonseed oil. less I tbsp. 

Use Y^ *^"P lard or vegetable oil or drippings 
from which water has been driven off, to take the 
place of I cup butter in a recipe. 

If Yl eup nuts is added to a recipe which calls 
for I cup butter, use only 8 2-3 tbsp. butter. 

If one square chocolate is added to recipe 
which calls for I cup butter, use 1 3 tbsp. butter. 

The foregoing suggestions for substitutions are 
compiled from the Cornell Reading Circle leaflet 
on cake making and from various Government 
publications. 

USES FOR LEFT-OVER CAKES 

Cake that is dry may be used in place of bread 
crumbs in a pudding recipe. Less sugar should 
be used if cake crumbs are substituted for bread. 

Slices of stale cake may be arranged in alter- 
nate layers with sliced fruit and covered with a 
soft custard. 

Dry cake may be steamed until moist and 
served hot with a pudding sauce.

Pastry flour makes a much more tender crust than bread flour and will 
require less shortening. 

Lard makes a very tender crust, but butter gives a better flavor. 

Shortening should be thoroughly chilled before using. When it is worked 
into the dough it makes the pastry short and tender, but that which is spread over 
the pastry w^hen rolling out makes it flaky. 

In very warm weather it is better to use a knife or fork to cut or rub shorten- 
ing in, rather than to use the fingers, as the heat from the hands often softens the 
shortening and makes the pastry sticky. 

When rolling out pastry use only enough flour to keep dough from stick- 
ing to the board and pan. 

While mixing pastry keep it as cool as possible; use ice-water when it can 
be obtained. Handle as little as possible. 



RECIPES 



Puff Paste Use I lb. flour and 1 lb. unsalted 

butter. Chop fine with a knife in an earthenware 
bowl; to make a stiff paste add a little ice water: 
then turn out of bowl on to baking board or marble 
slab. Beat until flat with rolling pin; do not touch 
with the hands; cut in three, place in a pile, one 
on top of the other, beat flat again, and cut a sec- 
ond time; repeat a third time. Put in ice chest 
6 hours, when it is ready for use. 

Pie Crust — Rub half a cupful of equal parts of 
lard and butter into 2 cupfuls of flour and mix the 
whole as lightly as possible into a stiff paste ^vith a 
little ice water; roll it out, folding the paste over 
each time. 

Apple Pie Peel and core 5 or 6 apples, cut into 

eighths. Line pie tin with half of pie crust, then 
pile on the apples. Cover with a mixture of ]/2 
cup of sugar, few gratings of nutmeg, ]/2 teaspoon 
cinnamon. Dot with butter. Lay top crust over 
and press edges firmly together. Bake 40 to 45 
minutes in moderate oven. 

To glaze top crust brush it over with the yolk 
of an egg to make it a deep brown; yolk and white 
mixed for a lighter brown; milk with a little sugar 
in it for very light glaze. 

Peach Pie Line a pie pan with crust and fill it 

with sliced canned peaches. Pour over the peaches 
a mixture of I tablespoonful sugar, ^2 teaspoonful 
finely chopped lemon peel, I tablespoonful lemon 
juice and 2 or 3 tablespoonfuls of peach juice. 
Cover with crust and bake in hot oven 20 or 30 
minutes or longer if necessary. Fresh peaches can 
be used in the same way, after they are peeled 
and sliced, but more sugar should be used if 
peaches are sour. 



Glazed Peach Pie — When nearly done take trie 
pie out of oven and brush the top with the white 
of an egg beaten to a froth, sprinkle a little sugar 
and a ievf drops of water on it. Put the pie back 
in oven and finish baking; be careful not to burn 
as it is liable to do when crust is glazed. Serve hot 
or cold. 

Cherry Pie Line a pie pan with crust and fill 

with ripe cherries, stoned. Use sugar to taste. 
Cover with crust and bake 20 to 30 minutes. 

Reispberry, blackberry and plum pie are made in 
the same way. 

Lemon Pie Mix I cup sugar with 3 tablespoon- 
fuls cornstarch, add I cup boiling water slowly 
and cook until clear; then add I teaspoonful but- 
ter, 2 beaten egg yolks and grated rind of J/J 
lemon; cool. Line pie plate with crust, prick the 
bottom with a fork, or use perforated pie pan. 
When crust is light brown pour in the lemon mix- 
ture. Whip the whites of 2 eggs stiff, add 2 table- 
spoonfuls powdered sugar; spread this mixture 
over the top for a meringue; return to oven and 
brown lightly. 

Custard Pie In making custard pies, heat the 

milk for the custard to the boiling point before 
adding to the eggs, and the undercrust will always 
be crisp and light. While pouring the milk into 
the beaten eggs, stir briskly and put into the crust 
while hot. 

Line a deep pie plate with paste. Rub I tea- 
spoonful flour with l/z <^"P cold milk until smooth; 
then add it to I '/^ cupfuls scalded milk. Cook 5 
minutes. Beat 3 eggs and combine with '/2 cup 
sugar, '/4 teaspoonful salt. Pour milk mixture over 
this, stirring briskly, add Yz teaspoonful flavoring

lightly in a slow oven. It is also delicious served 
with whipped cream. 

Cocoanut Custard — Beat 2 eggs and Yl cup 
sugar together until light, then add 1 pint milk, 
Yl grated nutmeg and I cup grated cocoanut. Line 
2 pie dishes with paste, hll ^vith mixture and bake 
in a quick oven 30 minutes. 

Pumpkin Pie Mix 1 cup sifted pumpkin, Yl 

teaspoonful salt, I saltspoonful mace and Yl tea- 
spoonful cinnamon together; beat I egg and mix 
^vith 2/3 cup sugar; pour Yl cup scalded milk and 
Yl cup scalded cream slowly into the egg and sugar 
and then combine with pumpkin mixture and pour 
into a deep pie plate lined with paste. Bake 33 to 
40 minutes. Squash may be used instead of pump- 
kin. 

A good substitute for eggs in pumpkin pies are 
soda crackers rolled fine, allowing two for each 
pie. 

Cranberry Pie Cook I Yl cupfuls cranberries in 

Yl cup water and Ya cup sugar for 1 minutes, 
then cool. Line pie pan with crust, fill with cran- 
berries, and place strips of crust across the top.

sprinkle with sugar and cinnamon and pile on pans 
lined with puff paste about Ya inch thick; then dot 
with bits of butter. Cover the top with strips of 
paste and bake in moderate oven until browned. 

Instead of the strips of paste, a meringue may 
be heaped on top and lightly browned in oven. 
Most fruit tarts may be cooked in this way. 



Creamed Apple Tart — Line a deep pudding dish 
with pastry, add 3 cups sliced apples, % cup brown 
sugar, and grated rind of Yl lemon; then cover 
with paste and bake 40 minutes. Lift the crust 
when done and pour in 2 cups boiled custard; 
cover, and serve cold. 

When whipped cream is used for filling, heap it 
high and do not put cover on again. 

Cherry Tart — Line a deep pie dish with plain 
paste; turn a tiny cup upside down in the middle, 
fill around with carefully picked and washed cher- 
ries and add sugar to taste. Lay a wide strip of

Ice cream is one of the most nutritious of desserts and easy of digestion. 

The term "ice cream" covers a large number of mixtures of different food 
value. Pure plain ice cream without eggs or fruit contains a high percentage of 
fat and sugar, but low in protein, while some so-called ice creams have no milk 
or sugar in them. If the housewife would know what proportion of fat, sugar or 
protein she is serving her family in her iced desserts, they would be made at home ; 
and because of the large variety of frozen dishes which is limited only by the imag- 
ination, the food contents of her dessert may be selected in relation to that of the 
meal with which it is to be served. 

When made at home ice cream is more economical than when bought from 
a caterer, and the housewife can be sure also of the purity and cleanliness of the 
ingredients. 

A freezer of standard make and of simple design, together with the habit of fol- 
lowing a few simple rules will greatly lessen the trouble of frozen desserts. Have the freezer 
can and the mixture to go in it cold; the ice crushed and mixed with coarse salt to the pro- 
portion of one salt to two of ice. Pour cold mixture into cold can, cover tightly, adjust 
can in freezer, pack around the sides with ice and salt. If freezer is packed Yl hour be- 
fore mixture is put in, the can is ice cold and the freezing is much speedier. Turn crank 
constantly until cream is nearly frozen. Put in any fruit or extra flavoring, as grapefruit. 
Have the fruit crushed and stir in well. Cover can, finish freezing. Remove dasher, pack 
ice cream with a spoon, cover. Add extra ice, draw water off, replug, cover freezer with 
newspaper and set aside until time to serve. 

When ready to clean freezer, wash the can and dasher with boiling soapy water; 
rinse in hot water adding 1 teasp. borax. Dry thoroughly, air, and put away from dust 
until ready to use again.

PICKLES 

(Food Preservation: A National Challenge, Cornell Reading Course) 

It is the custom with such vegetables as tomatoes and cucumbers to soak them in 
brine before putting them through the regular pickling process. The brine is probably used 
because it withdraws moisture from the tissue of the vegetable and makes it possible to 
obtain a firmer product, renders a milder flavor, gives the desired salt taste, and adds to 
the keeping quality of the pickle. Some persons prefer to omit the treatment with brine. 
The strength of brine required depends on the length of time the vegetable to be pickled 
is to remain in the brine. Too strong a brine softens and spoils the vegetable. Brine may 
be made by adding 1/3 to Yz cupful of salt to 1 qt. of water. Such brine should be strong 
enough to float a fresh egg. 

Grape leaves and cabbage leaves are said to help in retaining the natural green color 
of cucumbers and unripe tomatoes. The bottom and sides of the kettle are lined with 
leaves, the kettle is then filled with the mixture to be pickled, and the top of the mixture 
is covered with leaves. "Greening" vegetables by cooking them in copper kettles is dan- 
gerous, if copper utensils are used at all, they must be scrupulously clean. 



RECIPES 



TWO VINEGAR MIXTURES for pickles are as 
follov^s: 

Recipe 1. — I qt. vinegar, I [/2 teasp. whole black 
peppers, I !/2 teasp. celery seed, 1 j/2 teasp. allspice,

If pickles have not been soaked in brine, use 

2 oz. of salt. 

Cucumber Pickles — Soak cucumbers in brine for 
24 hours, then rinse and drain them. Cover them 
with vinegar or vinegar mixture to which has been 
added I tablespoonful of brown sugar for each 
quart of vinegar. Bring them slowly to the boiling 
point. Pack the pickles in a jar, and cover them 
with vinegar. 

Sweet Cucumber Pickles — Soak cucumbers in 
brine for 24 hours. Rinse, drain, and wipe them 
dry. Place them in a kettle, and cover them with 
the following vinegar mixture: 1 quart vinegar, I

mace, 8 whole black peppers. Heat the pickles 
slowly to the boiling point, and pack them at once. 



Quick Pickles — Put cucumbers in strong brine 
(J/2 to ^ cupful of salt to 1 quart of water). 
Bring them slowly to the boiling point, and simmer 
them for 5 minutes. Drain off the brine, cover 
them with cold water, and change it as it becomes 
warm. Keep changing the water until the pickles 
are crisp and cold. Cover them with a vinegar 
mixture made by either of the two preceding 
recipes.

water (I qt. water to '/4 cupful salt), then drain 
them well. Mix the mustard, the flour, the sugar, 
and the pepper, add the vinegar, and boil the mix- 
ture for 10 minutes. Pour the mixture over the 
chopped pickle while it is boiling hot, and seal 
the pickle in scalded jars. 

Dill Pickles — To each qt. of water allow 2 tbsp. 
salt; boil 5 minutes. When cold pack the pickles 
in jars with dill between. Fill with the brine, 
cover and keep in a cool place. It may be nec- 
essary to wash the pickles and pour fresh brine 
over at intervals.

It is a wise economy to purchase spices of the highest quality only, as the ground 
spices in particular offer a tempting medium for adulteration. Only a very small quantity of 
a pure spice will be required to impart a fine, delicate fragrance to food. 

Mustards and peppers should not be used to excess. Cloves, cinnamon, cassia, all- 
spice, nutmeg, mace, caraway, aniseed, etc., when used in moderation encourage appetite 
and relish for food and also help digestion. Physiologists state that the aromatic bodies 
when absorbed into the blood relieve and prevent nervous depression and "lowness" of 
spirits. 



RECIPES 



Fines Herbes — A combination of herbs, minced 
together, made up of a teasp. of parsley and ]/2 
teasp. each of marjoram, savory, chervil, and a 
little sage. Sprinkle over broiled or planked fish, 
place in the fold of an omelet, strew over shirred 
eggs, or serve with lettuce or romaine. Use in 
stuffing for baked cabbage, tomatoes, or game. 

Mint — Use fresh in mint sauce, cabbage-and- 
mint salad, drinks as orange-mint ade, or angel 
tip, orange-and-mint salad, lemonade, fruit cock- 
tails^ or hot or iced tea, and fresh or dry in a 
casserole of duck, apple jelly or gelatin, canned 
or dried pea soup, and with peas. 

Parsley — Use sparingly fresh, or dried and

To make dainty appetizing sandwiches takes less time and material than some house- 
wives realize. 

For the home luncheon, sandwiches offer the opportunity of both using an occa- 
sional left over and of providing a very substantial addition to the meal, and for tea or 
luncheon they may be made to add the spice or relish so necessary to the menu. 



Besides the most convenient white bread for sand- 
wiches, there is brown, Graham, whole wheat, rye, 
raisin, nut bread, rolls, beaten biscuit, crackers 
and even cornbread, and for a filling foundation, 
fish, meats, some vegetables, eggs, cheese, nuts, 
sweets, spices and pickles. 

Some sandwiches require that the bread used 
be fresh, others are better made with bread a day 
old. A very sharp knife is needed for slicing 
either. For rolled sandwiches take a long slim 
loaf of fresh bread, stand on end and slice thin, 
lengthwise. If a round or fancy shaped cutter 
is used more sandwiches may be gotten from bread 
sliced lengthwise than crosswise: but for square 
shapes, cut across the end of a loaf. 

For home luncheon if bread is very fresh it need 
not be trimmed of crusts, but it must be remem- 
bered that crusts may always be used to advantage 
either chopped into small pieces and browned for 
soup croutons, or dried, and ground into crumbs. 

A quick way to trim off crusts is to go around 
each slice with large scissors, or with a sharp 
knife, trim down a pile of slices all about the 
same size. This should be done before the filling 



is put in as bits of the filling left on the crusts 
will prevent them from being used to advantage. 

Time is also saved by creaming the butter and 
either spreading on each slice before it is cut from 
the loaf, or by using a small flexible knife to spread 
it on the trimmed cut slices. 

When creaming the butter any flavoring in- 
tended to be used in the filling may be combined 
at this time, either chopped olives, anchovy es- 
sence, sardine or salmon, chives, parsley, paprika 
or caviar. 

When making a meat sandwich it is sometimes 
well to remember just which relish is most suit- 
able for the meat to be used. Cold roast beef is 
always nicer Avith a bit of grated horseradish: cold 
pork, chili sauce: cold lamb, chopped capers; veal, 
tomato sauce; chicken and other fowl, salad dress- 
ing. 

Sandwiches to which French dressing is added 
should be eaten directly after they are put to- 
gether before the dressing soaks into the bread. 
Other sandwiches may be kept fresh for several 
hours by wrapping them in waxed paper or in a 
dampened napkin and placing where it is cool. 



APPETIZING SANDWICHES 

(Iowa State College Bulletin) 

Bread for sandwiches should be at least 24 hours old, cut in slices of uniform thick- 
ness and spread with creamed butter. Both slices should be buttered, as butter keeps the 
bread moist and prevents filling from soaking into the bread. 

The filling material adds to the food value of the sandwich. Any food capable of 
being mashed, finely ground, or thinly sliced is suitable for filling. It should be spread on 
one side of the buttered bread, the other side fitted to this and the sandwiches cut in dainty, 
convenient shape. 

The crusts should not be removed from noon lunches. For afternoon functions the 
sandwiches are more dainty with crusts removed. 

Sandwiches are served at noon and school luncheons, afternoon and evening parties, 
picnics, and informal entertainments.

bread slices buttered, with peach marmalade; cover 
with a slice of whole wheat bread spread with

Nuts — Nuts contain a great deal of fat and pro- 
tein, but very little water, so the finer nuts are 
chopped and mashed the more rapid will be their 
digestibility. 

To crack pecans and walnuts. let them stand in 
boiling water several hours. Crack the nuts gently 
around the sides, the meats will generally come 
out v^hole and without the bitter dark skin. 

To blanch almonds, shell and throw kernels into 
boiling water 5 minutes. Drain, pour cold water 
over. The skins will then rub off easily. Wipe 
dry. and cool before chopping. 

The Soy Bean, being so rich in fat responds sat- 
isfactorily to roasting. If carefully and properly 
done it is found to have a sweet nutty flavor and 
may be used in recipes in the place of almonds 
and peanuts. 

To roast soy beans, soak over night or longer 
in salted wrater. Drain and parboil in other water 
I hour. Drain again and place in a roasting pan 
in a hot oven ^vith the door open. Watch con- 
stantly and stir to keep from scorching. When 
done they are a rich brown.

The importance of plenty of fruit for every day food the year around cannot be 
too greatly emphasized. The health of the body is dependent on their phosphates, fruit 
sugars and organic acids, which no other food supplies so well. 



Some fruits, as oranges and lemons, may be 
found on the market every season, other fruits if 
not always found fresh may be had canned or 
dried. The valuable elements of both the orange 
and lemon are similar. Lemon juice is more acid, 
it is cooling, quenches the thirst and enters the 
blood in alkaline citrates. Its aroma and flavor 
make it especially liked as a basis of many fruit 
drinks and desserts. 

The orange is a rapid upbuilder and cleanser 
and has an even more delicious flavor and aroma. 
It contains citric acid, which is a liver stimulant 
and a gentle laxative. It also has a large supply 
of phosphates, a direct nerve food. 

The pineapple, rich in sugars, fragrance and a 
certain ferment which is a great aid to digestion, 
combines most pleasantly >vith other fruits. It 
is to be had at any time either fresh or canned 
and unlike some others it loses very little, if any 
of its natural flavor by canning. 

Bananas when unripe are rich in starch and best 
for cooking; ripe bananas arc very nourishing. 

Cranberries and rhubarb, next to the lemon, con- 
tain so much acid that a very little of their juice 
is needed to impart a high flavor to desserts. 
Their qualities are especially favorable to prevent 
excessive bacterial growth in the intestines, the 
great enemy to good health. 



The strawberry, raspberry, blackberry, peach, 
pear, and sweet apple all yield a fragrant cooling 
sub-acid juice, laxative and tonic in effect and add 
variety to a drink or fruit dish by their penetrating 
and pleasing flavor and color. 

The juice of the grape, containing 1 to 26 per 
cent of sugar is a source of energy, because of this 
high sugar percentage, and is easily digested since 
all fruit sugars, unlike cane sugar, is predigested. 

Raisins are the fruit of the grape dried. Lack- 
ing the water of the fresh grape, they are a con- 
centrated food filled with fattening, easily digested 
sugars, and minerals and organic acids in fair 
amounts. These tend to check intestinal fermen- 
tation and are highly influential in maintaining 
good health. Raisins of good quality are a whole- 
some addition to any meal, served either as a sep- 
erate dish or incorporated in a dessert. 

In preparing such fruits as plums, peaches, etc., 
for the table, the skin may be readily removed 
without injury to the flavor by first immersing them 
for a short time in boiling hot water. 

A silver knife should always be used for paring 
apples, pears and other fruits: if a steel knife is 
used the acid of the fruit acts on the iron of the 
knife and frequently causes a black discoloration, 
and there is also a noticeable metallic flavor.

one of the few accompaniments that seems delicious 
with all kinds of meat. Its acid is especially ac- 
ceptable with roast pork. Small apples peeled and 
baked with nutmeg may be served with pork or 
veal; fried apples and bacon for breakfast; apple 
sauce or baked or apple fritters with poultry or 
game. 

Apple syrup flavored with mint poured over 
baked apples add to the enjoyment of a dish of 
roast lamb.

SOME TESTS USED IN SUGAR COOKERY 

(Iowa State College Bulletin. "Cake") 

238° to 242° F. Soft Ball The stage at which a little of the sirup dropped into cold water may 

be formed into a soft ball that will just hold its shape in the fingers. Used in making icing, taffy, 
fudge, pinoche and (ondant. 

248° F. (about) Firm Ball — The stage at which the sirup tested as above will form a firm ball in 
the fingers. Used in making divinity, sea-foam, and pop-corn balls. 

290^ F. (about) Crack or Brittle The stage at which sirup becomes brittle immediately upon being 

dropped into cold water. Used in making butter scotch, glace nuts and taffy. 

254° to 345° F. Caramel — The stage at ^vhich sirup turns a dark yellow^ color and snaps like thin 
glass when cooled. Used in making nut brittle, and caramel syrup used for flavoring. 

To caramelize sugar melt dry in sauce pan or add small amount of water and boil until dark yel- 
lovr in color. The latter method requires a little less attention. To prepare caramel sirup, add as much 
boiling water as sirup, boil until smooth and store in bottles. 

Icings, fondant and other confections should be made on a clear day if possible, since a damp at- 
mosphere interferes with proper hardening. If the work must be done on a damp day, the cooking should 
be carried a little farther in each case. Fondant that has become a little too dry to handle may be re- 
stored by placing oiled paper over the candy and wrapping the dish in a moist towel. 

Fondant is the basis for many different confections and may be used also for dipping small cakes 
and frosting larger ones. A great variety of candies may be made from fondant by combining it with dif- 
ferent kinds of fruit and nuts, by using different flavorings and colorings and by moulding it into dif- 
ferent shapes.

sugar and water, cool, add the berries and bring 
very slowly to boiling point. As soon as sirup 
boils, remove dish from stove and let stand over 
night. Next day, drain sirup from berries and boil 
sirup until reduced to half its original volume. Put 
berries into a sirup and heat slowly. Boil gently 
for three or four minutes, then allow to stand for 
two hours or more. Boil gently a third time for 
five minutes. A smaller dish may be needed for 
last boiling. On the following day drain off sirup 
and spread berries on sheet of waxed paper. When 
surface is dry and berries cold, store in glass jars. 
The berries may be used as a confection and in 
the same ways that candied cherries are used. The 
sirup is excellent for flavoring and coloring pud- 
ding sauces and many other desserts. 

Candied Grape Fruit Peel — Wash peel from

been added one tablespoon of salt. Drain, place 
in sauce pan, cover with cold water and bring to 
boiling. Repeat three or four times or until the 
bitter taste is removed and the peel is soft. Drain 
and weigh. Make sirup using an equal weight of 
sugar and J/2 ^'■'P water. When sirup is thick and 
heavy, add strips and cook until pieces are clear, 
lifting pieces from time to time that they may not 
stick to pan. Remove to plate to cool and roll 
each piece separately in powdered or granulated 
sugar. When entirely cool store in glass jars. 



CLASS 29— CANDIES— RECIPES 



271 



CANDY RECIPES— GENERAL 



Uncooked Candy: Plain White Fondant — Have 
all ingredients prepared and utensils ready before 
beginning to make the candy. Roll the sugar until 
smooth, blanch the nuta, seed the dates or raisins, 
melt the chocolate, and beat the whites of eggs if 
necessary. 

1. To make uncooked candies use confectioner's 
sugar or ordinary pulverized sugar. Roll until 
smooth on the bread board. Beat slightly whites 
of eggs with 2 tbsp. cold water. Stir in enough 
sugar to make a smooth stiff paste. 

2. Cream J/j cup butter, beat in J/2 cup sifted 
or rolled confectioner's sugar, add 1 teasp. boiling 
water, stir in more sugar, add I '/^ teasp. boiling 
water, again more sugar until stiff enough to 
knead. 

3. Beat slightly I egg white with a pinch of salt, 
add the rolled sugar gradually until ready to form 
into shapes. 

4. Flavoring or coloring should be worked into 
the paste last. 

The above will serve as a foundation for many 
different varieties of candies, as the center of 
chocolate creams or stuffing for dates. It may be 
formed into shapes resembling any French candies. 
The balls of paste may be worked around nuts, 
chopped fruits or preserved fruits, marshmallows 
or creamed cocoanut. 

Chocolate Creams — Form white fondant into 
little balls size of a marble put aside to harden on 
waxed paper. Heat some confectioner's dipping 
chocolate, by cutting it in small pieces and putting 
in a pan over hot water. When melted cool, and 
either beat it to the consistency of molasses or mix 
in enough beaten white of egg to make a smooth 
thick paste. Dip the fondant balls into the choco- 
late paste until no white shows. A fork, a long 
straw or a wire, shaped like a spoon, or even the 
fingers, may be used to dip and remove the choco- 
late creams. Put aside to cool on heavy paraffin 
paper. 

Fruit and Nut Creams — Press halves of English 
walnuts on each side of a ball of flavored fondant, 
or knead ground nut-meats into the paste and roll 
into balls, decorate with a nut, or tiny piece of 
candied fruit. To cover the fondant balls with 
chopped cocoanut dip first into slightly beaten 
white of egg then into the cocoanut. 

Chop citron, dates, figs, currants, candied orange 
peel, raisins or any candied fruit to make fruit 
creams. Knead fruit into the fondant, form into 
balls, or flat bars, and set aside to harden. 

Fancy Midget Candies (Uncooked) — Roll out 
fresh fondant to '/4 inch thickness flavored first 
with wintergreen or peppermint, cinnamon, 
almond, ginger, extract and colored if desired with 



fruit coloring. Cut the rolled out paste into small 
rounds roll in granulated sugar. 

Cooked — Melt Yi cup red currant jelly in pan, 
add 1 cup sugar, boil until it spins a thread, add 3 
tbsp. gelatine dissolved in Y^ cup cold water and 
I tbsp. rose extract. Pour into shallow buttered 
pan, sprinkle with chopped pistachio nuts. When 
cold and firm cut into small rounds and roll in rose 
colored sugar. 

To Salt Peanuts and Almonds (To Blanch Nut*) 

— Cover raw peanuts or almonds with cold water, 
bring just to the boiling point, drain and slip skins 
from the nuts by pressing between thumb and fore- 
finger. Dry thoroughly on paper. Heat oil or 
butter or any clear vegetable cooking fat until it 
will brown a bit of bread in 30 seconds. Dip the 
nuts a few at a time in the oil and quickly remove 
when a faint light brown. Spread on brown paper 
and sprinkle lightly with fine salt. 

To Salt Walnuts, Pecans and Filberts — These are 
harder to blanch than almonds and peanuts, but 
proceed in the same way. After skins are re- 
moved, dry several hours, beat an egg white and 
rub each nut lightly with it; sprinkle with fine 
salt, lay on paraffin paper and slightly brown in a 
slow oven. 

Candied Orange or Grape Fruit Peel — Put the 

peel from 4 oranges in boiling water, boil till ten- 
der, changing the water twice. Drain. Scrape 
out the white part, cut the yellow pieces in strips, 
weigh, and to every lb. of peel use I lb. sugar, Yi 
cup water. Cook water and sugar until it spins a 
thread, add peel, simmer until transparent. Drain, 
roll each piece in sugar, dry in warm oven. Crape 
fruit peel may be candied the same way. 

Fruit Paste 1. Grind in the food chopper I 

cup each of seeded raisins, dates, figs, and enough 
nuts to make J4 cup ground. Add 1 tbsp. brown 
sugar mixed with I tbsp. orange juice. Roll this 
paste into a long round stick I inch in diameter. 
Put on the bread board dusted with powdered sugar 
and cut the roll into candies J/^ inch thick. Sugar 
coat each one and put a^vay to keep in a tin box. 

2. Boil 2 cups sugar, I cup milk, 2 tbsp. butter 
together until it will form a soft ball when dropped 
in cold water. Add I lb. of chopped fruit, raisins, 
dates or figs, and I cup chopped nuts. Beat until 
creamy. Knead till stiff, roll and cut in same way 
as No. I, or shape into a loaf and slice ^vKen 
needed. 

Stuffed Dates, Figs or Prunes — Make a mixture 
of 1 egg white, Ya cup orange juice, 1 teasp. 
lemon juice and enough powdered sugar to form 
a paste, or use a plain fondant. Work into the 
paste, chopped nut meats. Add preserved ginger 



2 72 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Sec. IV— Pt. 2— COOKING AND RECIPES 



or Maraschino cherries, marshmallows, bits of pre- 
served fruit or even a little peanut butter. Stuff 
the dates, figs or prunes with this paste and roll 
them in granulated sugar. 

Fruit Kisses — Beat 1 or 2 egg whites very stiff, 
add I cup brown sugar or white powdered sugar, 
J/^ teasp. flavoring. Add I cup chopped nuts or 
candied fruits, dates or figs, or I cup of both. 
The kisses must be of the consistency to drop 
stiffly off the spoon on to a buttered pan. Place 
them several inches apart and bake in a slow oven 
until lightly browned. 

Panacha or Mexican Kisses — Mix I lb. dark 
brown sugar with '/2 cup cream in a pan over the 
fire. Stir until it boils. Cook to a soft ball. Re- 
move from fire and stir in I cup of unbroken pecan 
nieats. When the sugar becomes granulated drop 
the candy in little flat cakes on waxed paper. 

Peanut Bars — Beat together in the order men- 
tioned I cup minced roasted peanuts, I stiff egg 
white, 1 cup brown sugar, I/4 teasp. salt, \/2 teasp. 
vanilla. Spread on a buttered pan. Bake in a 
slov? oven. Cut in bars. 

Opera Creams — Mix well 3 cups sugar, I cup 
of top cream from a qt. of milk, '/3 teasp. cream 
of tartar. Cook without stirring until a soft ball 
may be formed in cold water. Pour into a deep 
warm bowl. When nearly cool, beat till creamy, 
knead on a board till smooth, dredge the board 
with powdered sugar if the candy sticks. Nut 
meats or chopped fruits may be put in while knead- 
ing, or roll paste into bonbons and decorate with 
nuts or bits of candied fruits. 

Peppermints and Wintergreen Candies — I. Heat 
1/2 cup milk or thin cream, 2 cups sugar, 5 drops 
of oil of peppermint, or essence of wintergreen. 
Stir until dissolved, then boil for 3 minutes without 
stirring, then beat until creamy. When cooling, 
drop on waxed paper. 

2. Make a stiff paste by beating together con- 
fectioner's sugar and 2 tbsp. cream, 6 drops of 
essence of peppermint or wintergreen. Make into 
flat balls topped with a walnut meat; or, roll the 
candy out lightly and cut with a sharp cutter about 
the size of a fifty-cent piece. 

Lemon Drops — Stir over .i hot fire until thor- 
oughly heated, 1 cup sugar, 2/3 cup water, I 
teasp. cream of tartar. Then boil briskly until 
candy is hard and brittle if dropped in cold water. 
Add 1 tbsp. lemon juice or extract, boil up once 
to distribute evenly the lemon, pour into buttered 
plates. When cool enough to handle form into 
drops, sticks or thin squares. Handle as little as 
possible to prevent destroying the transparency 
of the candy. 



Buttei* Scotch — Boil quickly I cup brown sugar,

Popcorn Candy — The popcorn must be freshly 
popped to use in candies or it will taste tough. 
To secure snow white fluffy popcorn kernels, put 
only enough corn grains in the popper to cover 
the bottom, hold high over a hot flame shaking 
all the time so the kernels will not scorch. The 
popped corn may be sprinkled with melted butter 
and salt while hot, or sugared in different ways. 

1. Plain Sugared: Boil until it threads 1 cup 

sugar, Yl teacup water. Pour over about 3 qts. 
popped corn. 

2. Colored — For yellow flavor the syrup with 
lemon or orange; for red or pink, flavor with rose 
extract, beet juice or cranberry juice; for green, 
crushed spinach leaves will bring enough juice to 
color the syrup. 

3. Chocolate Sugared — Make a syrup of I cup 
sugar, I square chocolate, Yi teasp. butter, '/^ cup 
water; or, I cup sugar, Y^ cup corn-syrup, I oz. 
chocolate, Yl cup water. When it threads flavor 
with vanilla and pour over 3 qts. popped corn, 
stir well. 

Popcorn Kisses — With a very sharp chopper, cut 
up fluffy popped corn kernels. Use only crisp 
ones. If necessary put them through a meat 
chopper with I cup nutmeats. Beat 3 egg whites 
very stiff, stir in sugar to the proportion of Y'i 
cup powdered sugar to 1 egg white to be used 
with 1/3 cup chopped corn, 1/3 cup nutmeats. 
Beat the sugar into the whites for 5 minutes. Add 
a little at a time the nutmeats and popcorn. Mix

oven about 20 minutes. 

White Fudge Boil for about 5 minutes 2 cups 

white sugar, I cup milk; when it forms a soft ball 
when dropped in cold water take from stove and 
add I teasp. vanilla, 1 tbsp. butter. Beat until

Chopped nuts or dates or preserved cherries 
beaten into the fudge are a delicious addition. 

Chocolate fudge is made by adding 2 teasp. 
cocoa, or chocolate to white fudge before the but- 
ter is put in. 



Fudge Made with Canned Milk — Put into a cook- 
ing pan 2 cups sugar, 2 squares of bitter choco- 
late, butter size of an egg, about 2/3 cup canned 
milk. Boil this until a little dropped in cold water 
will form a soft ball. Take off the fire, add 1 teasp. 
vanilla and stir until thick. Pour into buttered 
pans, cut into squares. Chopped nutmeats may be 
added as the candy begins to thicken. 

Many delicious cream candies are made by us- 
ing canned milk with a little additional water to 
the recipes calling for milk, or plain canned milk 
in place of cream. Only the best brands of canned 
milk should ever be used.

Afternoon Tea — The charm of a cup of tea, or any hot drink has first in its deHcate 
brew, and steaming hotness, second in its dainty service. 

Select green tea, or Orange Pekoe, or one of the Ceylon teas. Pour boiling water 
over the leaves in a hot tea pot, using one slight teasp. tea leaves to each cup water. Al- 
low it to remain a few minutes, until the tea is the strength to suit. Strain into thin cups. 
Serve, with an attractive garnish, as thin slices of lemon, bits of crystallized ginger, or mar- 
aschino cherries, and accompanied by lemon wafers, dainty sandwiches or cakes, sugar and 
cream. 

A more delicate flavor may be secured by pouring the boiling water over the tea in 
a tea-ball. This is more convenient for some, and is thought to be more economical. 

When arranging a proper equipment for an afternoon tea table, simplicity and dainti- 
ness should characterize it. Use a table just high enough for convenience in serving and 
large enough to hold the few necessary things without crowding. The tray may contain 
the swinging kettle of boiling water, the teapot, the tea balls and dish, the cream and sugar. 
This leaves room on the table for a tasteful arrangement of any other China, linen or silver 
necessary, cups, saucers, and small plates for sandwiches, and garnishes if served. All linen 
used should be the daintiest one has, the silver, the best; and the China the most attractive. 



RECIPES — GENERAL 



Coffee Good coffee making is an art that seema 

difHcult for some to acquire. Several points must 
be carefully noted and followed to always get 
good results. 

1. Keep the coffee pot sweet and clean. Wash 
as soon after using as possible. Once a week fill 
2/3 with water, add I tbsp. baking soda, boil I 
hr. rinse and wipe clean. 

2. Select a good brand of coffee that will al- 
ways be the same blend. A popular mixture is 
2/3 Java 1/3 Mocha. 

3. Use fresh water. Water that has been boiled 
long becomes flat and stale and does not unite with 
the coffee in a delicious blend. 

4. Decide on one method of making coffee and 
make it carefully each time. 

Boiled Coffee Have medium fine ground coffee. 

Allow I heaping tbsp. to each cup water and I 
extra tbsp. coffee for the pot. Put the coffee in 
pot add the quantity of cold water, I cup to each 
person served and one extra. Bring to a boil. To 
get the full strength from the coffee let it boil until 
it is as strong as desired, or; let boil up three times. 
Remove to a hot electric plate, settle with dash of 



cold water or crushed egg shells. Never let hot 
coffee stay on the coffee grounds when settled. 
Pour off into a hot urn and serve. 

Drip Coffee — For this method the coffee must 
be ground very fine, almost to a powder. Use only 
I teasp. coffee to a cup, and one extra for the pot, 
being half as much as for boiled coffee. Put coffee 
in a piece of clean cheese cloth, pour boiling water 
through it slowly. This makes a very delicate 
coffee and clear. 

Percolator Coffee — Put medium fine ground 
coffee in upper part percolator, I tbsp. to each 
cup and I tbsp. extra. Put the boiling water in 
lower part of percolator. Cover. Place over fira 
and let water percolate up through the coffee. 
Test its strength by pouring a little out into a cup. 
When just right set aside to settle. Serve. 

After Dinner Coffee — When coffee is served for 
after dinner or at the afternoon tea hour it should 
be of extra strength and diluted with hot water to 
suit individual tastes. 

To make Vienna coffee, serve it with whipped 
cream piled in each cup.

Cafe au lait is made of equal parta of strong 
coffee and hot milk added either at time of mak- 
ing or %vhen it is poured. 

Serve buttered hot Sally Lunn with hot afternoon 
cofTee, or toasted and buttered raisin bread, coffee 
cake, frosted ginger bread, ^vafe^s, cake or savory 
sandwiches. 

A Good Cereal Beverage — This is especially 
palatable and nourishing for children for whom a 
hot drink is desired. They should never be given 
tea, coffee, or even cocoa w^hich is really a food 
and too heavy for even an adult as a drink. 

Take 3 lbs. whole wheat, 1 lb. whole barley, 
I cup ground chickory, 3 tbsp. molasses, 3 tbsp. 
butter. Roast wheat and barley till brown, stir- 
ring constantly to avoid scorching. Roast separ- 
ately as they vary in time required. When as dark 
as roasted coffee, add butter and molasses to the 
two together, stirring al! until grains are dry and 
are separated. Remove from oven, and vrhen cold 
add the chickory. Grind in coffee mill. 

To make: Use 2 tbsp. to I^ cups cold water 
per person. Boil gently 1 hour. Serve with sugar 
and cream or milk. 

Spiced Cocoa — Scald I qt. milk. Melt 3 heap- 
ing tbsp. cocoa, 3 tbsp. sugar, few grains salt, in 
Yl cup boiling water until smooth. Add remain- 
ing Yz cup boiling water, boil up once. Combine 
this with the scalded milk. Add Yl teasp. vanilla, 
Yl teasp. cinnamon. Beat w^ell, serve very hot 
with w^hipped cream. Pass vanilla wafers, mac- 
aroons or lady fingers. 

Chocolate Chocolate or cocoa should be made 

rich and Jaeaten vigorously to mix the chocolate 
well and to prevent formation of scum. 

I. Mix Y^ cup grated chocolate or cocoa with 
Yi cup sugar. Stir smooth in I cup boiling w^ater. 
Add I more cup water and put on to boil a few^ 
minutes. Add 3 cups rich milk, boil up once, 
beat hard for a minute. A beaten egg may be 
added to give more body and richness. Serve hot 
with spoonful w^hipped cream to each cup. Marsh- 
mallow^ cream may be substituted or 2 marsh- 
mallow^s to a cup. Serve with cinnamon toast. 

2. A simple rule for two or three cups chocolate 
is I teasp. grated chocolate to I teasp. sugar and 
I cup milk; adding I cup boiling water to the pot. 
Boil up several times, beat, serve. 

Hot Mulled Cider — Heat I qt. cider to boiling 
point. Pour it slowly over 3 beaten eggs and Yl 
cup sugar. Beat well. Bring again to a boil. Re- 
move and serve in glasses heated in warm water 
to prevent cracking. 

For spiced cider add Yl teasp. sweet whole spices 
before bringing to a boil. Remove spices before 
serving. 

Iced Drinks or Unfermented Drinks- — For a cool- 
ing drink during the warm days nothing is so re- 



freshing as fruit juices, lightly sweetened and 
diluted. These are quickly prepared, and such a 
variety of delicious beverages are possible with 
the many different fruits of the summer that one 
need never tire of this form of refreshment. For 
those who have not time to prepare a combination 
fresh fruit beverage, there are bottled juices of 
excellent quality on the market that may be simply 
diluted with iced water. 

Attractive service of an iced drink is as impor- 
tant as the delicate blending of the delicious juices. 
To be pleasing to the eye as well as the palate it 
should be served in sparkling glasses, thin and of 
attractive shape. Dainty, white paper napkins and 
straws tend to add to the impression of coolness. 
If a more elaborate arrangement is desired, the 
glasses may be placed on one of the new^ trays 
with embroidered napery, a dish of fruit sand- 
wiches perhaps, and a small basket of Bowers. 

The fruit drinks besides being thirst quenchers 
are by nature of their acid contents invigorating 
and healthful. They arouse the appetite, stimu- 
late the various organs of digestion and elimina- 
tion, the stomach, intestines, skin, liver and kid- 
neys, and increase the phosphates in the blood. 
They are not only invigorating and health promot- 
ing for the well, but are sources of great benefit 
in some illnesses and to the convalescent. 

Iced Tea and Coffee should be made strong and 
drawn off their leaves at once to be put aside to 
cool. Dilute when ice cold with iced water. Serve 
in tall thin glasses w^ith slices of lemon or cream. 

Iced Chocolate Make a rich chocolate, cool, 

add 1 teasp. vanilla. Dilute if necessary with 
ice cold water, or if ice supply is known to be

mon; or: Add I egg, yolk and white beaten sep- 
arately, to every pint of milk. Fill glass half full 
with this eggnog. Stir in Yi glass of the sw^eetened 
cocoanut milk. Top with cream and nutmeg.

mint leaves, strain, cool. Beat I egg yolk with 1 
teasp. sugar; beat the whites stiff; whip cream 
to Yl cupful; fold the yoke, white and cream into 
the milk.

11. DIURETICS— TO STIMULATE ACTION OF 
KIDNEYS 



Mineral and carbonated waters hold first rank. 

Mineral waters possess, in addition to the prop- 
erties of plain water, a mildly stimulating effect 
upon the mucous membrane of the stomach, due 
to the carbon dioxide gas and the salts they con- 
tain. 

"These waters are very useful when taken one- 
half an hour before meals to cleanse the mucous 
membrane of the stomach and prepare it for the 



reception of food. They also serve to dilute and 
wash out the waste materials from the system 
through the kidneys." 

"The alkaline waters all contain more or less 
carbon dioxide gas and their more important in- 
gredients are the alkaline carbonates." 

They are useful in neutralizing the uric acid 
in the system. 

Generally speaking, the European waters are 
richer in minerals than are the American.

I. NECESSITY FOR PRESERVING FOODS 

This season it is imperative, as never before, to avoid the waste of all 
kinds of food. On account of the increased production in gardens, people must 
appreciate the importance of taking care of the surplus. To save the surplus of 
perishables will provide variety for the winter diet, lessen the expenditure for 
food, and help to simplify the growing problem of transportation. 

IL CONSIDERATION OF DIFFERENT MEANS OF PRESERVATION 

The present situation demands careful consideration of the best means of preserving 
different local foods. The selection of canning and drying, or other means, depends upon 
its suitability to the product being preserved, the cost and difficulty of securing containers, 
and the ease in handing and storing the finished product. 

Canning retains the original form, color, flavor and texture of fruits and vegetables 
to a greater degree than do other means of preserving. In addition, canned foods require 
less preparation before serving. Considering the initial cost of containers, canning is more 
expensive than drying, brining or curing. The present shortage of tin and glass makes it 
more important than formerly to consider whether food shall be canned or not. 

Drying furnishes a good substitute for canning, and when properly done gives 
attractive and wholesome products. Much space in storing and expense of containers are 
saved, since a ton of many different vegetables in the fresh state when properly dried will 
average only about 1 75 pounds in weight. 

Brining such vegetables as cabbage, cauliflower and cucumbers is an economical 
way of saving these products. Some vegetables can be saved in brine better than by can- 
ning them. In brining, fewer containers are required for storing large quantities of vege- 
tables, and containers such as crocks, kegs and barrels are less expensive than tin and glass. 



283 



284 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Sec. IV— Pt. 2— COOKING AND RECIPES 

Storing matured crops is of great importance. Economy demands that such vege- 
tables as legumes and root crops be allowed to mature, since in this state they are more 
nutritious and less time and money are spent in storing. 

Curing of meats is to be considered only when such products are raised on the farm. 
It is well to encourage the reviving of old methods with the use of the smokehouse, preserva- 
tion in salt, etc., for carrying over surplus meat on the farm and thus securing delicious 
products. The canning of meats should not be attempted in the household at the present 
development of canning methods. 

III. CANNING OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES 
General Suggestions on Canning — It is important during the present season to con- 
sider what vegetables to select for canning and the most economical procedure to use. The 
following suggestions should have general value: 

1 . Do not can vegetables which can be matured and form a more nutritious food 
mature than when canned green. Lima beans and others are examples of this class. 

2. Root crops like beets and carrots should be stored instead of canned. 

3. Some products like tomatoes can be concentrated in purees and pastes and thus 
take up less space. 

4. Fruit pastes, which are concentrated products made of fruit pulp, can also be 
considered. These are of thicker consistency than jams and fruit butters and may be dried 
and packed in layers, thus being economical and convenient. 

5. Fruit juices for jelly stock and other purposes can be extracted, bottled in vari- 
ous containers, sterilized and sealed. Larger quantities can thus be economically saved than 
when finished products demanding more time, fuel and sugar are made in the summei sea- 
son. If the jelly is made only as needed, fewer glasses will be required since these contain- 
ers will be used again and again. 

6. Valuable fruit syrups which can be substituted for cane and sorghum syrups can 
be made from juice of apples, scuppernong grapes and other fruits. Where fuel is plentiful for 
the boiling processes involved, these are economical because they do not require the use 
of any sugar. These syrups can also be used instead of sugar when making jams and marma- 
lades of the same fruits. 

7. The city housekeeper who cans fruits and vegetables must consider a number 
of points. In the first place, she must watch the markets to find when local products are 
available at lowest prices. She must also be assured that the vegetables she secures for can- 
ning are fresh. This is most important. Not only is quality injured by staleness but the 
difficulty of sterilization is greatly increased. It would be worse than useless to attempt to 
can vegetables which are being disposed of cheaply because they are almost ready to decay. 
When fresh vegetables can be secured at reasonable prices the city housekeeper who wishes 
to preserve any quantity should further weigh the relative cost of canning and drying, con- 
sidering equipment, fuel, time, containers and the vegetables to be preserved. Fruits present 
fewer problems. 

8. In the larger towns and cities, teachers can reach and instruct larger numbers of 
housekeepers by working through the many well-established existing organizations. Com- 
munity canning kitchens in the public schools may be started where conditions warrant it; 
but impartial advice should first be secured from the extension director of the State agricul- 
tural college, as such undertakings require trained leadership for success. 

IV. DRYING OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES 
Methods of Drying — The process of drying vegetables and fruits is a simple one and 
can be done in the average home by the housewife. A uniformly dried product is desired 
and can best be secured by using a drier or evaporator constructed so that heated currents of 



CLASS 31— PRESERVING FOODS IN THE HOME 285 

* 

air pass over the product as well as up through it, gathering the moisture and passing away. 
The movement of the current of air induces a more rapid and uniform drying. 

Vegetables and fruits can be dried in an oven, in trays or racks over the kitchen 
stove, in a specially constructed drier, and where there is electric current, by the newly de- 
vised method of exposing trays of the material to be dried to the air current from an ordinary 
electric fan. There are small driers on the market which give satisfactory results. The small 
cookstove driers of evaporators are small ovenlike structures, usually made of galvanized sheet 
iron or of wood and galavanized iron. They are of such a size that they can be placed on the 
top of an ordinary wood or coal range or a kerosene stove. These driers hold a series of 
small trays on which fruits or vegetables are placed after being prepared for drying. Port- 
able outdoor evaporators are especially convenient when it is desired to dry as much as 1 
bushels of fruit or vegetables per day. They are usually constructed of wood except the parts 
in direct contact with the heater. The home made dry kiln used in some sections of the country 
can be cheaply and easily made of brick and stone. Sun drying is only satisfactory in very 
dry climates. If done, every precaution should be taken to protect the vegetables or fruits 
from dust and insects when exposed to the sun. 

If drying is done in a cookstove oven, leave the oven door ajar. Frequently note 
the temperature of oven. Trays for use in the oven can be made by using a convenient- 
sized piece of galvanized wire screen and bending up the edge one or two inches. 

It is important to know the temperature of the heat in the drier, and this cannot be 
determined very accurately except by using a thermometer. An ordinary chemical thermom- 
eter can be suspended in the drier. If a thermometer is not used, the greatest care should 
be given to the regulation of the heat. The temperature in the drier rises rather quickly, and 
the product may scorch unless close attention is given. The temperature for drying should be 
rather low to prevent scorching the product. For most vegetables, after surface moisture is 
removed, begin drying at a temperature of 110° F. Increase temperature gradually from 
1 10° to 145° F. and complete drying in two to three hours. The time required for drying 
vegetables varies. However, it can easily be determined by a little experience. 

Dried Vegetables — As great care should be given to the selection and preparation 
of vegetables for drying as for canning. To secure a fine quality of dried products, much 
depends upon having the vegetables absolutely fresh, young, tender and perfectly clean. 
Wash all vegetables and clean well, if steel knives are used in paring and cutting, have them 
clean and bright, so as not to discolor the vegetables. 

After vegetables are prepared properly they are blanched — that is, they are plunged 
into boiling water for a short time. The blanch gives a more thorough cleaning, removes 
the strong odor and flavor from certain kinds of vegetables, and makes them more flexible. 
This allows the moisture in the vegetables to evaporate more quickly and uniformly. Use 
a wire basket or cheesecloth bag for blanching. After blanching the required number of min- 
utes, drain well and remove surface moisture by placing vegetables between two towels or 
by exposing to the sun and air for a short time. 

The vegetable thus prepared is spread in a thin layer on the trays of the drier. The 
material should be stirred or turned several times during the drying in order to secure a 
uniform product. 

Dried Fruits — In very dry climates fruits are usually dried in the sun. Most fruits 
dried in the sun discolor unless especially treated. For drying fruits in small quantities for 
home use the small dryer is much more satisfactory. On very hot, dry days fruits may be 
dried in the sun until surface begins to wrinkle and then finished in the drier. Only fresh, 
ripe fruits should be used. 

Before spreading fruit on the trays of the drier, line the tray with wrapping paper 
or cheesecloth. There is a possibility of the acid of the fruits acting upon the zinc. After 
drying, cool quickly, as fruit when cooled slowly shrivels and looks unattractive. 



286 THE HOM E-KEEPING BOOK— Sec. IV— Pt. 2— COOKING AND RECIPES 

The ideal moisture content of dried fruits is about 23 per cent. The ability to judge 
accurately as to when the fruit has reached the proper condition for removal from drier can be 
gained only by experience. When sufficiently dried it should be so dry that it is impossible 
to press water out of the freshly cut ends of the pieces, and so that it will not show any of 
the natural grain of the fruit on being broken, yet not so dry that it will snap or crackle. It 
should be leathery and pliable. 

Storing Dried Product — When vegetables are first taken from the drier, if completely 
dried, they are very brittle. They are more easily handled and are in better condition for 
storing if allowed to stand one to three hours to absorb enough moisture to make them 
more pliable before putting into bags or storing otherwise. If it is not convenient to store 
products immediately and they are allowed to stand several days, just before storing they 
should be heated to 1 60° F. to destroy any insect eggs that might be on them. Care should 
be taken not to heat the vegetables higher than 1 60° F. 

Dried vegetables and fruits should always be stored in moisture-proof containers 
and in a dry place free from dust and dirt. The best container is a tin box, bucket, or can 
fitted with a perfectly tight cover. Perhaps the most convenient and cheapest container is 
the small paper bag. A small amount should be put in each bag, just enough to use for 
one or two meals. This will prevent the opening of any dried product that cannot be con- 
sumed in a short time. The upper part of the bag is twisted to form a neck. The neck is 
bent over and tied tightly with a string. The entire bag is then painted with a coat of melted 
paraffin, using a small brush or a frazzled end of a piece of rope. This makes the bag prac- 
tically moisture and insect proof. To protect further from insect ravages, pack the bags, 
after labeling, in a tin container, with a tightly fitting cover. A large number of bags may be 
stored in an ordinary lard can. A glass jar with a tight seal is a good container for dried 
products. Paraffin-coated paper containers of various sizes can be found on the market. 
If such containers are used, they should also be stored as just suggested for the paper bags. 

All dried products should be examined occasionally. Upon the first appearance of 
insects, spread thin layers in the sun until insects disappear; then heat at a temperature of 
1 60 ' F. and restore carefully. 

V. PRESERVATION OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES BY FERMENTING, 
SALTING, AND VINEGAR PICKLING 

General Statement — The preservation of food products by fermentation has been 
practiced for centuries, and in Europe many fermented substances are well-known articles 
of food. In this country, however, sauerkraut and dill pickles are practically the only foods 
frequently preserved in this manner. Salted vegetables are prepared to some extent in this 
country, although the method of salting is more commonly used with meats and fish. Vin- 
egar pickling is well known in all parts of the country. A number of vegetables may be 
preserved by fermenting and salting, and when properly prepared and stored they will 
keep for a long time. These methods of preserving foods cannot replace canning or dry- 
ing, but have certain advantages, chief of which are the following: Containers may be used 
for storing the vegetables, such as wooden kegs, stone crocks or large glass bottles, which 
are not adapted to canning; no sugar or fuel is required in the fermenting or pickling of 
vegetables, which is an advantage so far as cost is concerned; and owing to the shortage 
of tin and glass containers these methods of preservation are especially well worth consid- 
ering at this time. 

FERMENTING OF FRUITS OR VEGETABLES — The method of preserving fruits 
and vegetables by fermentation is perhaps best illustrated by the method of making sauer- 
kraut in the home, which is given in the following paragraphs: 



CLASS 31— PRESERVING FOODS IN THE HOME 287 

I. In making sauerkraut for home purposes the outer green leaves of the cabbage 
should be removed, just as in preparing cabbage for boiling. In addition, all decayed or 
bruised leaves should be discarded and the core removed. Cabbage may be shredded by 
one of the hand-shredding machines sold upon the market for such purposes, or if such an 
instrument is not available the heads may be cut into thin slices with a large knife. The 
core is omitted when machine for shredding is not available, because it is difficult to shred 
it fine enough with a knife. The shredded cabbage should be packed immediately into a 
perfectly clean, water-tight receptacle, such as a cider or wine barrel, .keg or tub. Four or 
five gallon earthenware crocks are recommended for family use. After opening this quan- 
tity of sauerkraut it can be used up before spoilage sets in. 

As the cabbage is packed into the barrel or crock, salt in the proportion of one 
pound of salt to 40 pounds of cabbage should be added and distributed evenly throughout 
the cabbage. Experiments have shown that approximately two and one-half pounds of salt 
to each hundred pounds of shredded cabbage gives the best flavor to the resulting kraut. 
When the barrel or crock is nearly full the cabbage should be pressed down as firmly as 
possible and covered with a clean board cover. It is advisable but not essential that a clean 
cloth be placed over the cabbage before the cover is put into place. The salt soon extracts 
a considerable amount of the cabbage juice from the cabbage and a sufficient weight of 
clean brick or stone should be added to cause the brine to rise above the wooden cover. 
Care should be taken not to use lime or sandstone for weights, for the acid produced by 
fermentation attacks the lime and destroys the keeping quality of the' brine. Tubs and 
covers made of yellow or pitch pine should not be employed because such woods cause a 
disagreeable flavor. 

The barrel or crock is now set aside and fermentation is allowed to proceed undis- 
turbed. If the weather is cold or the product is stored in a cool cellar it may take three to 
five weeks for the fermentation to be completed. If placed in a warm room fermentation 
may be completed in ten days to two weeks. As soon as fermentation starts a foam ap- 
pears on the surface of the brine. This is soon followed by a film which develops into a 
heavy scum if allowed to remain. The scum should be removed by skimming as often as 
it forms, every day if necessary. This scum is really a mold growth which feeds upon the 
acid in the brine and if allowed to grow undisturbed it soon destroys both brine and 
kraut. As soon as gas bubbles cease arising, the scum should be again removed, if any has 
formed, and a layer of hot melted paraffin about one-fourth to one-half inch thick should 
be poured upon the brine. If the sauerkraut is made during the fall and stored in a cool 
place there is no absolute necessity for the layer of paraffin, for the low temperature will 
prevent decomposition. No doubt the popular idea that sauerkraut made from early cab- 
bage will not keep is based upon the fact that the fermentation of sauerkraut made from 
such cabbage occurs in warm weather, and the rapid growth of scum soon destroys both 
brine and kraut if the surface is not properly protected. 

II. Covering the Material — The surface of the fermenting material should be pro- 
tected against spoilage. This should be done by placing between the vegetables and the 
board cover mentioned above several thicknesses of clean cheesecloth, or even a layer 
about one inch thick of clean beet tops, rhubarb or grape leaves. In the case of sauerkraut 
clean cabbage leaves can be used. 

III. Protecting the Surface of Fermenting Material — If uncooked vegetables or 
fruits are fermented, there will also be more or less bubbling and foaming of the brine dur- 
ing the first stages of fermentation. After this ceases a thin film will appear, which will 
spread rapidly over the whole surface and develop quickly into a heavy folded membrane 
composed of mold growth as explained. It is very important that this scum be prevented 



288 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Sec. IV— Pt. 2— COOKING AND RECIPES 

from forming, if the product is to be kept for a considerable time. One important char- 
acteristic of this scum is that it will not grow in the absence of air. The free oxygen of the 
air is absolutely necessary for its growth. Consequently the exclusion of air from the surface 
of the brine will entirely prevent the scum from forming. There are three feasible methods 
of excluding the air. The first method is to use an oil, like cottonseed oil, which floats on 
the surface and effectually prevents air from reaching the brine. Brine with a layer of 
liquid petroleum or cottonseed oil one-half inch thick on the surface will keep indefinitely. 
The only objection to liquid oils is the difficulty of getting at the preserved vegetables with- 
out getting them covered with oil, w^hich it is difficult to remove. 

The second method is to cover the surface with very hot melted paraffin. If the 
paraffin is sufficiently hot to make the brine boil when poured upon it, the paraffin will 
form a smooth even layer before hardening. After solidifying it will effect a perfectly air- 
tight seal. Paraffin has, in comparison with liquid oil, the advantage of ease in handling 
and of not coming in contact with the fermented vegetables when they are removed. Further, 
paraffin can be used over and over and thus the expense is small in the long run. If it be- 
comes dirty, it can be heated very hot and strained through cheesecloth or a thin layer of 
cotton. The one disadvantage with paraffin is that the development of gas below the layer 
will break the seal. If the paraffin breaks it should be removed, remelted and replaced. 
Before adding paraffin the containers should be set where they will not be disturbed until 
ready for use. Any attempt to move them may break the seal and necessitate remelting 
and resealing. 

If cottonseed oil or paraffin is used to cover the brine it is advisable so to adjust 
the amount of brine used and weights on the cover that the brine comes up to but does not 
go over the cover. In this case only the brine exposed between the cover and sides needs to 
be oiled or paraffined, thus saving covering material. 

The third method is to pack the barrels as full as possible and replace the head. 
In using this method of fermentation with beets, cucumbers, chayotes, or string beans, fill 
the barrels as full as possible, add cover and weights. Let stand for 24 hours to allow the 
initial gas to escape and head up tight. Bore a one-inch hole in the head and fill the barrel 
full with brine. There should be no air space in the barrel. Allow the barrel to stand until 
bubbling has stopped. Add more brine if necessary and plug the vent tight. If the barrel 
does not leak, fermented products put up in this manner will keep indefinitely. 

IV. String Beans may be preserved by a slight modification of the method used 
for sauerkraut: Remove the tip ends and strings from the beans, wash, drain and weigh 
them. For each hundred pounds of beans weigh out three pounds of fine salt. For smaller 
amounts use the same proportion of salt (three per cent, by weight). Pack the beans in 
the keg or crock in layers, sprinkling each layer with the fine salt, using just enough so that 
the amount weighed out will suffice to pack the whole quantity of string beans. Cover and 
ferment as described for sauerkraut. 

V. Cucumbers, Chayotes and Beets — These vegetables are best preserved by fer- 
menting them in a weak salt solution, as the salt will not extract sufficient water from them 
to form a brine. Wash the vegetables and pack them whole in a keg or other container. 
Pour over them a weak brine, cover with a board, and weight, and set aside to ferment 
as in the case of sauerkraut. The brine is prepared as follows: dissolve one pound salt in 
1 quarts water, stir until the salt is dissolved and then add I Yz pints vinegar. 

SALTING FRUITS AND VEGETABLES 

Vegetables like dandelions, spinach, kale, beet greens and string beans may be pre- 
served by packing with a sufficiently large quantity of salt to prevent any fermentation or 
development of bacteria. Wash, drain and weigh the vegetables Weigh out also a quantity 



CLASS 31— PRESERVING FOODS IN THE HOME 289 

of fine salt equal to one-fourth the weight of the vegetables. Pack the vegetables in a 
clean keg, stone crock or other container in layers about one inch thick and sprinkle each 
layer heavily with salt. Cover the material with a clean cloth and a round board as de- 
scribed for sauerkraut, add a weight and set aside. When ready for cooking the salted 
vegetables should be soaked several hours in clean water and cooked in the same way as 
one would the fresh vegetables. 

PRESERVING FRUITS OR VEGETABLES IN VINEGAR 

Pickled vegetables or those preserved in vinegar are of three general types: those 
preserved whole in vinegar alone (sour pickles), those in which spices or sugar and spices 
are added to the vinegar (sweet or spiced pickles), and the chopped vegetables such as 
chow-chow, ketchups, etc., which contain vinegar. The acetic acid in the vinegar preserves 
these materials by preventing the growth of yeasts, molds or bacteria, which would cause 
the fruit to spoil.

HOME CANNING BY THE ONE-PERIOD 
COLD-PACK METHOD 

By O. H. Benson, Agriculturist, Boys' and Girls' Extension Work, 
Northern and Western States 
(Farmers' Bulletin No. 839, U. S. Department of Agriculture, Extracts) 

Without previous experience, and with no other equipment than that to 
be found in almost every home, anyone, adult or child, should be able to can food 
satisfactorily by the method described in this Bulletin. 

By this method various vegetables, soups, meats, fish and practically any 
other foods or combination of foods can be canned, as well as fruits and tomatoes, 
the products most commonly canned. 

in all home canning it should be borne in mind that when hermetically sealed con- 
tainers are difHcult to obtain, food products which can not be preserved easily in other 
ways should be given preference. This would make inadvisable in most cases at times 
like the present, the canning of such products as hominy, dried beans, potatoes and similar 
foods. 

Most home-makers are familiar with some form of canning. Much of the canning 
practiced in homes, however, has been restricted to the putting up of fruits. The canning 
of vegetables and of meats has been considered until recently by all but a relatively few 
persons to be too complicated to be done satisfactorily in the home. But it is a simple 
matter to can practically any food product in the home with ordinary kitchen equipment 
and with the expenditure of comparatively little labor. This is described in the following 
paragraphs; the system was developed primarily for use in the Northern and Western 
States rather than in the South. By its use the time required for the treatment of food to 
prepare it for keeping is reduced to a minimum. 

NOTE: — The exact wording of the government bulletin has not been closely followed here, but 
has been varied, to give only the simple directions for home canning in small quantities under the simplest 
method and conditions. We recommend that the housewife write the Department of Agriculture for a 
copy of the Bulletin, if only to have it handy for reference in the event she should want to go a little 
beyond these directions in some particular. By all means have the Bulletin if any large amount of can- 
ning is to be attempted; it shows methods, better even though slightly more elaborate, and better uten- 
sils procurable at little expense, for use in the canning of larger quantities. EDITORS. 

Preparations for Canning — Start with clean hands, clean utensils, clean, sound, fresh 
products, and pure, clean, soft water. No withered or unsound vegetables or fruits should 
be canned. If possible, those picked the day of canning should be used. Peas and corn, in 
fact, which lose their flavor rapidly, should be canned within five hours if a choice product 
is desired. 

Wash the containers before you start; if glass or crockery jars, place in cold water 
over a fire to heat; have them hot and ready for use when the products have been prepared 
for packing. 

Wash carefully all grit and dirt from the materials to be used. Grade the products 
for ripeness. Large fruits and vegetables should be pared if necessary, and small fruits, ber- 
ries and greens picked over carefully. 

Steps in Canning — After the preparatory measures, the canning method consists of 
five steps — scalding or blanching, cold-dipping, packing, processing, and sealing. In can- 
ning berries and all soft fruits the blanching is dispensed with. 

291 



292 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Sec. IV— Pt. 2— COOKING AND RECIPES 

The products to be canned are blanched or scalded usually by being placed in a 
cheesecloth bag or dipping basket into boiling water and allowed to remain there from 1 to 
1 5 minutes, depending on the kind of product. In the case of greens and green vegetables, 
however, the scalding is accomplished most satisfactorily in steam, as volatile oils and 
other substances remain in the food under this treatment. Such products may be put into a 
colander, set over a vessel of boiling water and covered as tightly as possible. Better results 
may be obtained by the use of a steam cooker. 

As soon as removed from the boiling water or steam the product should be dipped 
into cold, clean water and immediately removed and drained for a few moments. The 
temperature of the water used for cold dipping should be as low as possible. 

The product should be packed carefully into hot jars as soon as removed. In the 
case of fruits, boiling hot syrup or hot water is then added. In the case of vegetables, hot 
water usually is used and salt is added for seasoning. The scalded rubbers and tops of jars 
are put into place, the tops of cans sealed, and the containers are placed in a hot-water bath, 
pressure cooker, or other similar device for processing. 

Processing is the final application of heat to sterilize the product and is continued 
for a period determined by the character of the product and the kind of apparatus used 
(see time schedule). The containers should be placed in the processing vessel as soon as 
they are filled. 

Immediately after the termination of the processing period, while the products are 
still hot, glass and similar containers must be sealed. 

Jars should then be placed in a tray upside down to cool and closely examined for 
leaks. If leakage is found the covers should be tightened until they are completely closed. 

Tin cans may be cooled by plunging them in cold water. When the packed con- 
tainers are thus cooled, they should be stored in a cool, dry place not exposed to freezing 
temperature. Most products packed in glass jars will bleach or darken if exposed to light; 
it is well, therefore, to wrap jars in paper. From time to time, especially in very hot 
weather, both glass jars and tin cans should be examined to make certain that there are 
no leaks, swellings, or other signs of fermentation. 

Equipment Required — Whatever type of apparatus is used for processing or steriliz- 
ing, a number of utensils are needed for properly handling the products during the preced- 
ing steps. These include five or six acid-proof pans with covers for use in handling and 
blanching acid fruits, two tablespoons, one set of measuring spoons, one wire basket or sev- 
eral yards of cheesecloth for use in blanching, six wiping cloths, two hand towels, one dup- 
lex fork for lifting hot jars, several sharp paring knives, a generous supply of clean hot and 
cold water, a garbage pail for scraps and a good stove or other heating device. 

For processing, home canners may choose from among several types of apparatus, 
according to their needs and means and the extent of their canning intentions. There are 
five general types of outfits in common use. These are described at length in the Bulletin 
from which these paragraphs are taken, and those who plan any extended amount or quan- 
tity of canning should obtain a copy and study these several methods carefully. For home- 
canning in small amounts the following homemade outfits are fully sufficient. 

Home-made outfits are constructed of such utensils as wash-boilers, tin pails, milk 
cans, metal washtubs and lard pails Such canners should have well-fitting covers and false 
bottoms or lifting platforms of metal or wood ; the latter are to support jars or cans to pre- 
vent direct contact with heat and also permit a free circulation of water and steam around 
and under the containers. 

Difficulties in the Operation of hot-water bath canning outfits may be avoided if the 
following rules are observed. Support the jars on a perforated platform sufficiently to 
permit the circulation of water under and around the jars. Have the water cover the tops 



CLASS 31— HOME CANNING. ONE-PERIOD. COLD-PACK METHOD 293 

of the jars by at least one inch. Count time as soon as the water begins to boil vigorously. 
Remove the jars from the water and tighten the covers as soon as the.time is up. 

Containers — The method here described does not require a particular class of con- 
tainer. Glass jars, crockery jars (with air-tight tops) or tin cans of practically any type may 
be used if they are carefully cleaned and properly handled and sealed. When products are 
to be used in the home, glass jars are perhaps preferable to tin cans. Jars may be sealed 
without the use of special apparatus and may be used over and over again if taken care of 
and new rubbers are used each time. Tins, on the other hand, must be thrown away each 
time. Tin cans, however, have certain advantages. They exclude light and so prevent 
bleaching; they may be packed, handled and transported more safely than glass jars. 

Altitude Changes — The directions given here for canning are based upon an altitude 
from sea level to I 000 feet and upon the use of the quart can or container. If using smaller 
cans or jars, reduce the time a trifle; if using larger, increase the time. For altitudes above 
1 000 feet the time of sterilization should be increased at the rate of 1 per cent, for each 
500 feet. 

Seasoning — In seasoning foods it should be kept in mind that most vegetables as 
well as meats are injured in flavor and quality by an excessive use of salt for seasoning in 
the canning process. A little salt is very palatable and its use should be encouraged, but it 
is better to add no salt in canning than to use too much. Salt can be added to suit the taste 
when canned goods are served. 

Syrups — Syrups are employed usually in canning fruits. A formula much used in 
some sections for syrup is 3 quarts of sugar to 2 quarts of water, boiled to a thin, medium- 
thin, medium-thick, or thick syrup. The formula sometimes called the Eastern formula is 3 
quarts of water to 2 quarts of sugar, boiled to a thin, medium-thin, medium-thick, or thick 
syrup. The first formula may be used for canning all kinds of fruits delicate in flavor and 
texture and when sugar is low or reasonable in price. When sugar is high in price and the 
character of the fruit is such that less sugar is required, the Eastern formula may be used. 
The following may be remembered: 

Thin syrup is sugar and water boiled sufficiently to dissolve all of the sugar, but is 
not sticky. Such syrup has a density of from 12 to 20 per cent. Medium-thin syrup is that 
which has begun to thicken and becomes sticky when cooled on the finger tip or spoon; dens- 
ity 20 to 40 per cent. Medium-thick syrup is that which has thickened enough to roll or 
pile up over the edge of the spoon when it is poured out; density 40 to 50 per cent. Thick 
syrup is that which has become so thick that it is difficult to pour out of a spoon or con- 
tainer, but has not sugared; density 50 to 64 per cent. 

Thin syrups are used for all sweet fruits such as cherries, peaches, apples, etc., that 
are not too delicate in texture and color. Medium-thin syrups are used in the canning of 
the medium-sweet fruits, such as blackberries, currents, dewberries, huckleberries, raspber- 
ries, etc. Medium-thick syrups are used in the canning of all sour fruits, such as goose- 
berries, appricots, sour apples, etc., and delicately colored fruits such as strawberries and 
red raspberries. Thick syrup is used in preserving and making all kinds of sun-cooked 
preserves. 

Canning Fruit Without Sugar — All fruits can be canned for future use for jelly mak- 
ing, pie filling, salad purposes, etc., without the use of sugar by simply adding hot water 
instead of the hot syrups. It has been found practicable also with certain vegetables to sub- 
stitute sugar for salt in the canning process, and then add other seasonings to taste when 
serving. 



294 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Sec. IV— Pt. 2— COOKING AND RECIPES 

In canning fruit without sugar, can it the day it is picked ; cull, stem, seed and clean 
fruit by placing in strainer and pouring cold water over it. Pack the product carefully in 
hot glass jars or tin cans until full. Use tablespoon, wooden ladle or table knife for packing 
purposes. Pour boiling hot water over the product in the hot jar. Place rubbers and caps 
in position, not tight. If using tin cans, seal completely. Place product in the sterilizer, 
vat or canner, and sterilize for the length of time given, which for hot-water bath is 30 min- 
utes. After sterilizing remove the filled containers. Seal jars; invert to cool and test for 
leaks. Wrap in paper to prevent bleaching and store in a cool, dry place. If tin cans are 
used it will be found advantageous to plunge them into cold water immediately after steriliz- 
ing, to cool them quickly.

CANNING DIRECTIONS 



VEGETABLES 

Tomatoes Scald I Yi minutes or until skin 

loosens. Cold dip. Remove stems and cores. 
Pack directly into cans or hot jars. Press down 
with tablespoon (add no water). Add level tea- 
spoon salt per quart. Put rubbers and caps o( jars 
into position, not tight. Seal tin cans completely. 
Sterilize (water-bath) 22 minutes. 

Sweet Peppers — Use sweet green peppers. Place 
the peppers in the oven and bake them until the 
skins separate from the meat. Remove the skins. 
Pack them solid in hot glass jars or tin cans. Add 
water. Add I level teaspoonful of salt per quart. 
Put the rubbers and caps of jars in position, not 
tight. Cap and tip tin cans. Sterilize (water- 
bath) 90 minutes. Remove the jars; tighten the 
covers; invert the jars to cool, and test the joints. 
Wrap the jars to prevent bleaching. 

Fumpkiiu, Squash, Hominy and Sauerkraut — 
Prepare and cut into convenient sections. Blanch 
3 minutes. Cold dip; pack closely in hot jars or 
cans. Fill with boiling water. Add level teaspoon- 
ful salt per quart. Put rubbers and caps of jars 
into position, not tight. Seal tin cans completely. 
Sterilize (water-bath) 120 minutes. 

Sweet Com — Remove husk and silk. Blanch 
5 minutes on cob. Cold-dip: cut corn from cob 
and pack directly in hot jars or cans (Ya inch of 
top). Fill with boiling water. Add level teaspoon- 
ful salt per quart. Put rubbers and caps of jars 
into position, not tight. Seal cans completely. 
Sterilize (water-bath) 180 minutes. 

Corn seems to give home canners more trouble 
than do most products; but with care and study 
corn may be canned as easily as any other product 
grown in the garden. A little experience in select- 
ing the ear and the ability to recognize corn that 
is just between the milk and the dough stage are 
important. Cut the corn from the cob with a 
sharp, thin-bladed knife, and pack it at once into 
• sterilized jars. Best results can be obtained when 
one person cuts the corn from the cob and one 



person fills the containers. If it is necessary for 
one person to work alone, he should cut off suffici- 
ent corn to fill one jar, pour on boiling water, add 
salt, place the rubber and the cap in position, and 
put the jar into the canner or hot water at once. 
Corn expands a little in processing, and for this 
reason jars should not be filled quite full. Corn 
that has reached the dough stage before being 
packed will have a cheesy appearance after can- 
ning. Corn should never be allowed to remain in 
the cold-dip water, and large quantities should not 
be dipped at one time unless sufficient help is avail- 
able to handle the product quickly. Water-logged 
or soaked corn indicates slow and inefficient pack- 
ing. 

When canning sweet corn on the cob, follow 
same directions but pack whole ears in jars instead 
of the cut-off corn. 

Home Canning Field Corn — This product is 
usually known as corn club breakfast food, or 4-H 
brand food product. The corn should be selected 
between the milk and the dough stage. Wide- 
mouthed glass jars or tin cans should be used. 
Avoid packing container too full, as the product 
swells during the sterilization period. The corn 
should be canned the same day it is picked from 
the field, if possible. The yellow field-corn makes 
a yellow, butter-like food product when ground and 
canned. Avoid mixing the white and the yellow or 
Bloody Butcher corn in the same batch of food 
products. Secure a good grade of food chopper 
for grating the corn. Small 10 cent hand graters 
can be used, but work with these is too slow and 
tedious. 

Blanch the corn ears in boiling hot water or live 
steam for 10 minutes. Remove and dip quickly in 
cold water. Cut the corn from the cob with a 
sharp, thin-bladed knife. Feed the corn to the 
food chopper and grind to a pulp. Cook this 
product in a kettle, add one level teaspoonful salt 
to each quart, and a little butter, and sweeten a 
trifle with sugar. Cook (stir while cooking) until 
the product has assumed a thickened or pastelike 
mass. Then pack this product immediately in tin

296 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Sec. IV— Pt. 2— COOKING AND RECIPES 



cans or hot glass jars to one-fourth inch of the 
top. Seal jars by placing rubber and cap in posi- 
tion and seal tin cans completely. Place jars and 
cans in wash boiler or sterilizer and process (hot- 
water-bath) 180 minutes. 

After this product has been sterilized and cooked 
and stored away, it will form a solid, butterlike 
mass, which when removed whole from the jars or 
pack may be cut in convenient slices for toasting, 
frying and baking purposes, and will make a de- 
licious food product, palatable, economical and 
nourishing. 

Vegetables Such as Wax Beans, Stringless Beans, 
Okra, Green Peppers, Cabbage and Brussels 
Sprouts — String or hull. Blanch in live steam for 
5 to 10 minutes. Remove and dip quickly in cold 
water. Pack in hot jars or tin cans and add boil- 
ing hot water until jars or tin cans are full. Add 
one level teaspoonful salt to each quart. Put rub- 
bers and caps of jars in position, not tight. Seal 
tin cans completely. Sterilize (water-bath) 120 
minutes. 

Lima Beans, Peas and Other Vegetables or Com- 
binations of Them — Blanch in live steam for 5 to 
1 minutes. Dip quickly in cold water. Pack im- 
mediately in hot glass jars or tin cans. Add boiling 
hot water to fill container. Add level teaspoonful 
salt per quart. Place rubbers and caps of jars in 
position, not tight. Seal tin cans completely. Ster- 
ilize (water-bath) 180 minutes. Remove from con- 
tainer; tighten cover; invert to cool and test the 
joints. Wrap in paper to prevent breakage and 
store. 

Peas — A cloudy or hazy appearance of the 
liquid when peas are keeping well indicates that 
the product was roughly handled in blanching and 
cold-dipping, or that split or broken peas were not 
removed before packing. When peas are too old 
and blanching is not done carefully, the skin be- 
comes cracked and the liquid cloudy. Some waters 
of high mineral content have a tendency to in- 
crease cloudiness, also to harden the peas. 

Cauliflower — Use the flowered portion. Plunge 
it into cold brine (one-half pound salt to 1 2 quarts 
water). Allow the cauliflower to remain in brine 
for one hour. Blanch it three minutes and dip 
quickly into cold water. Pack it in hot glass jars 
or tin cans. Fill with boiling water and add a level 
teaspoonful salt for each quart. Put rubbers and 
caps of jars in position, not tight. Cap and tip 
tins. Sterilize (water-bath) 60 minutes. Remove 
the jars; tighten covers; invert jars to cool, and 
test the joints. Wrap the jars with paper to pre- 
vent bleaching. 

Mushrooms — Caution: Unless you are absolutely 
sure that you know a mushroom when you see it, 
do not run the risk of gathering and using for food 
what you think are mushrooms. A large number 
of persons are poisoned every year because of 



carelessness in this regard. Many very poisonous 
plants closely resemble edible mushrooms. Can 
mushrooms immediately after picking; if allowed 
to stand they become unfit for use. (See Farmers 
Bulletin, 796, Some Common Edible and Poisonous 
Mushrooms.) 

Wash and trim the mushrooms. If small, can 
them whole; if large, they may be cut into sections. 
Blanch the mushrooms in boiling water 5 minutes 
Remove and plunge them quickly into very cold 
water. Pack in hot glass jars and add boiling 
water to cover; add one level teaspoonful salt to 
the quart. Place rubbers and caps of jars in posi- 
tion, not tight. Sterilize (water-bath) 90 minutes. 
Remove the jars; tighten covers; invert jars to cool 
and test the joints. Wrap jars in paper. If can- 
ning in tin, always use lacquered cans. After open- 
ing containers, remove the mushrooms immediately 
and use them as quickly as possible. 

Root and Tuber Vegetables, Such as Carrots, 
Parsnips, Salsify, Beets, Turnips and Sweet Pota- 
toes — Grade for size, color and degree of ripeness. 
Wash thoroughly, use vegetable brush. Scald or 
blanch in hot water sufficiently to loosen the skin. 
Dip quickly into cold water. Scrape or pare to 
remove skin. Pack whole vegetables, slices or 
cross-section pieces in hot glass jars or tin cans. 
Add boiling hot water until full. Add level tea- 
spoonful salt to quart. Place rubbers and tops of 
jars in position; partially seal, but not tight. Cap 
and tip tin cans completely. Sterilize (water-bath) 
90 minutes. Remove jars from canner; tighten 
covers; invert to cool, and test joints. Wrap in 
paper and store. 

How to Prevent the Fading of Beets — Small 
beets that run 40 to the quart are the most suitable 
size for first-class packs. The older the beet the 
more chance there is for loss of color. When pre- 
paring the beet, leave on one inch of the stem and 
all of the tail while blanching. Blanch not more 
than 5 minutes, and cold-dip. The skin should be 
scraped from the beet, not peeled. Beets should 
be packed whole, if possible. Well-canned beets 
will show a slight loss of color when removed from 
the canner, but will brighten up in a few days. 

Greens or Potherbs — A large number of culti- 
vated and wild greens are edible, and if canned by 
this method will make a succulent and valuable 
food for the winter and spring months. Among 
the cultivated greens are Swiss chard, kale, Chin- 
ese cabbage leaves, upland cress, French endive, 
cabbage sprouts, turnip tops, young tender New 
Zealand spinach, beet tops, dandelion, young ten- 
der dasheen sprouts, native mustard, Russian mus- 
tard, coUards, and tender rape leaves. Among the 
wild greens are pepper cress, lambs quarter, sour 
dock, smartweed, sprouts, purslane, or "pusley," 
pokeweed sprouts, dandelion, marsh marigold, 
wild mustard, and milkweed (tender sprouts and 
young leaves). 



CLASS 31— CANNING AND PRESERVING 



297 



Can the day they are picked. Wash clean, sort 
thoroughly, allowing no foreign weed leaves or 
other vegetable matter to remain. Rid the greens 
of all sand. Rid of dry or decayed or diseased 
leaves. Place the greens in a crate or cheesecloth 
and blanch in live steam either in an improvised 
home-made steamer or regular commercial steamer 
for 1 5 minutes. Remove the greens and plunge 
quickly into cold water. Place on the table and 
cut into convenient lengths. Pack tight in hot jars 



or tin cans. Add hot water to fill the container 
and season to taste. The product will be slightly 
improved if a few strips of boiled bacon or chipped 
beef are added. A little olive oil also improves the 
flavor. If using glass jars, place rubbers and tops 
in position; partially seal. If using tin cans, cap 
and tip completely. Sterilize (water-bath) 120 
minutes. Remove from canner, tighten covers of 
jars; invert to cool, and test the joints. Wrap in 
paper to prevent bleaching, and store. 



VEGETABLE COMBINATIONS 



Com and Tomato Combination — Blanch fresh 
corn on the cob 3 minutes. Cold-dip quickly. Cut 
the corn from the cob, cutting from tip to butt. 
Scald the tomatoes I Yl minutes and cold-dip. Re- 
move the skin and core. Chop tomatoes into 
medium-sized pieces. Mix thoroughly 2 parts 
tomatoes with I part corn. Pack the mixture in 
hot glass jars or enameled tin cans. Add a level 
teaspoonful salt per quart. Put rubbers and caps 
of jars in position, not tight. Cap and tip tin cans. 
Sterilize (water-bath) 1 20 minutes. Remove the 
jars; tighten the covers; invert the jars to cool, and 
test the joints. Wrap the jars with paper to pre- 
vent bleaching. 

Corn, Tomato and String Bean Combination — 



Use I part corn, I part green string beans, 3 parts 
tomatoes. Blanch fresh corn on the cob 5 min- 
utes and cold-dip. Cut the corn from the cob, 
cutting from tip to butt. Prepare string beans and 
cut them into convenient lengths. Blanch them 
4 minutes and cold-dip. Blanch tomatoes I to 
3 minutes and cold-dip. Remove the skin and 
core. Cut the tomatoes into medium-sized pieces. 
Mix thoroughly. Pack the mixture in hot glass 
jars or enameled tin cans. Put rubbers and caps 
of jars in position, not tight. Cap and tip tin 
cans. Sterilize for the time of 120 minutes (water- 
bath). Remove the jars; tighten the covers; in- 
vert the jars to cool, and test the joints. Wrap 
the jars with paper to prevent bleaching. 



FRUITS 



Soft Fruits and Berries — These include apricots, 
blackberries, blueberries, cherries, currants, dew- 
berries, figs, gooseberries, grapes, huckleberries, 
peaches, plums, raspberries and strawberries. 

After hulling, seeding, stemming or skinning the 
fruit, place fruit in a strainer and rinse by pouring 
cold water over it. Pack from strainer into hot 
jars or cans without crushing, using big spoon or 
ladle. Hot syrup previously prepared should be 
poured over the fruit at once. Before packing a 
second jar, place rubbers and caps in positions, not 
tight. If using tin cans, seal completely. Enam- 
eled tin cans should be used for all highly acid ber- 
ries. Sterilize (water-bath) 16 minutes. Remove 
from canner; tighten covers; invert to cool, and 
test joints. Wrap in paper to prevent bleaching, 
and store. 

Another Recipe for Strawberries — Canned by 
this recipe, strawberries will not rise to the top 
of the syrup. Use only fresh, ripe, firm and sound 
berries. Prepare them and add 8 ounces sugar 
and 2 tablespoonfuls water to each quart of ber- 
ries. Boil slowly for 1 5 minutes in an enamel or 
acid-proof kettle. Allow the berries to cool and 
remain several hours or overnight in the covered 
kettle. Pack the cold berries in hot glass jars or 
enameled tin cans. Put the rubbers and caps of 
jar* in position, not tight. Cap and tip tin cans. 



Sterilize (water-bath) 8 minutes. Remove the 
jars; tighten the covers; invert the jars to cool, 
and test the joints. Wrap the jars with paper to 
prevent bleaching. 

Hard Fruits, Apples, Pears and Quinces — Re- 
move skin and core. Cut into convenient sections 
or slices and drop into slightly salted cold water to 
keep from tarnishing. Blanch I [/2 minutes. Cold- 
dip. Pack closely into hot jars or tin cans. Fill 
with hot syrup. Put rubbers and caps of jars in 
position, not tight. Seal tin cans completely. 
Sterilize (water-bath) 20 minutes. Remove from 
canner; tighten covers; invert to cool and test 
joints. Wrap in paper to prevent bleaching, and 
store. 

Windfall Apples — Separate apples into two 
grades; whole and reasonably sound and firm, first 
grade; all other apples (bruised, worm-eaten, and 
those containing decayed spots), second grade. 

Whole Apples, First Grade Pare and core. 

Drop whole apples in cold, slightly salted water, to 
keep from tarnishing. Pack whole apples in gallon 
tin cans or 2-quart hot glass jars. Add thin hot 
syrup until full. Place rubbers and tops of jars in 
position, not tight. Seal tin cans completely. Ster- 
ilize (water-bath) 16 minutes. Remove from can- 
ner; tighten covers; invert to cool, test the joints. 
Wrap in paper to prevent bleaching, and store. 



298 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Sec. IV— Pt. 2— COOKING AND RECIPES 



Apple-Pie Filling — The only difference between 
the canning of apples for pie filling and canning 
them whole as by the directions above is that the 
apples should be sliced immediately after paring 
into cold, slightly salted water. It will be 

found desirable to can first-grade apples either 

FRUIT 

The fruit juice may be pressed out of fruit by 
means of a cider press, special fruit press, or other 
improvised press; then heated in an acid-proof 
kettle up to II 0° F. The fruit juice may then be 
poured into ordinary hot jars, hot bottles, or tin 
cans, and handled by the same directions as those 
for canning of fruit itself. If poured into miscel- 
laneous bottles it is suggested that the fruit juice 
be sterilized as follows: Make a cotton stopper 
and press into the neck of the bottle and leave 

SYRUP MADE FROM WINDFALL 

Add 5 ounces powdered calcium carbonate to 7 
gallons apple cider. Powdered calcium carbonate 
(carbonate of lime) or, to give it its common name, 
precipitated chalk, is low-priced and harmless. 
Boil the mixture in a kettle or vat vigorously for 
5 minutes. Pour the liquid into vessels, preferably 
glass jars or pitchers; allow to stand six or eight 
hours, or until perfectly clear. Pour the clear liquid 
into a preserving kettle. Do not allow sediment 
at bottom to enter. Add to the clear liquid one 
level teaspoonful of lime carbonate and stir thor- 
oughly. The process is completed by boiling down 
rapidly to a clear liquid. Use density gauge or 
candy thermometer, and bring the temperature 
up to 220^ F. If a thermometer is not available, 
boil until bulk is reduced to one-seventh of the 
original volume. To determine whether the syrup 

is cooked enough test as for candy by pouring 

a little into cold water. If boiled enough it should 
have the consistency of maple syrup. It should 
not be cooked long enough to harden like candy 
when tested. 



whole or quartered, and second-grade apples and 
products prepared from poor stock sliced for use 
in pie filling. Second-grade apples and products 
prepared from poor stock should not be sold, of 
course, without labels which make the grade plain. 

JUICES 

during the sterilization period. Set bottles in boil- 
ing hot water up to the neck of the bottle, sterilize 
the fruit juice for 40 minutes at a temperature of 
1 65° F. Remove the product, press cork in top 
over cotton stopper immediately. If the cork fits 
well, no paraffin need be used. If a poor cork, 
it may be necessary to dip the cork in a melted 
solution of wax or paraffin. Fruit juices and apple 
cider when handled in this way will not "flatten 
in taste" and will keep well for future use. 

APPLES AND APPLE CIDER 

When the test shows that the syrup has been 
cooked enough, pour it into fruit jars, pitchers, 
etc., and allovsr it to cool slowly. Slow cooling is 
important, as otherwise the suspended matter will 
not settle properly and the syrup will be cloudy. 

A good way to insure slow cooling is to stand 
the vessels, full of syrup, in a bucket or a wash- 
boiler or to place them in a fireless cooker. The 
white sediment which settles out during cooking 
is called "malate of lime," and is a harmless com- 
pound of lime with the natural acid of the apple. 
When the syrup is cooled, it should be stored in 
fruit jars, bottles, or jugs and crocks. Place the 
rubber and cap or cotton stopper or cork in posi- 
tion and tighten. Place the container in boiling 
hot water and sterilize (water-bath) 15 minutes. 
Remove jars and tighten covers; invert to cool and 
test the joints. Store for future use. This recipe 
is for making syrup primarily for home consump- 
tion. If the product is to be sold legal require- 
ments as to labeling should be ascertained and 
complied with. 



PRESERVES 

The one-period, cold-pack method of canning will be found especially help- 
ful in eliminating the necessity of using paraffin or other wax tops for jellies, jams 
and preserves. Three recipes and directions for canning jellies, jams and preserves 
by this method follow to illustrate the application of the method. The use of con- 
tainers with screw tops is recommended for these products. This will make un- 
necessary the expense and trouble of using paraffin, and will make the melting, 
molding and deterioration of the top parts of the packs less likely. 



Strawberry — Make a syrup of I quart of water 
and I I pounds of sugar and cook it in an open 
kettle until the usual temperature for making can- 
dies, jellies, etc., is reached. If a candy ther- 
mometer is used cook the preserves until they 
reach a temperature of 265" F. A candy ther- 
mometer registers 265^ F. wrhen placed in the 
syrup. Add 8 pounds of berries to the syrup. 



Cook very slowly, just at the boiling point. Stop 
the cooking when the thermometer registers 219° 
F. and pour into shallow pans to cool. Hasten the 
cooling by pouring syrup over the berries. Skim 
while cooking. Fill into hot jars. Put the rubber 
and cap into position, not tight. Cap and tip if 
using enameled tin cans. Sterilize (water-bath) 
20 minutes. Remove the jars; tighten covers;

invert the jars to cool, and test for leaks. Wrap 
the jars in paper to prevent bleaching. 

Cherry — Place I gallon of cold vyrater in a kettle 
and add I pounds of pitted cherries. After bring* 
ing to boiling point continue to boil slowly for 18 
minutes. Add 1 2 pounds of granulated sugar and 
cook until after the mixture has been boiled vio- 
lently for a few minutes. If a candy thermometer 
is used cook the mixture until a temperature of 
219'-' F. is reached. Pack into hot glass jars. Put 
the rubber and cap in position, not tight. Cap 
and tip if using enameled tin cans. Sterilize 
(water-bath) 20 minutes. 



SUN PRESERVES 
Strawberry — Select ripe, firm berries. Pick and 
preserve the same day. Hull and rinse as in No. I 
under Strawberry Canning. Place them in a shal- 
low platter in a single layer; sprinkle sugar over 
them; pour over them fifty degree syrup (same as 
strawberry preserves, but boiled thicker). Cover 
them with a glass dish or a plain window glass. 
Allow them to stand in the hot sun 8 to I 2 hours. 
Pack them in hot screw-top jelly glasses. Put the 
rubber and cap in position, not tight. Cap and 
tip if using enameled tin cans. Sterilize (water- 
bath) 20 minutes. Remove the jars; tighten cov- 
ers; invert the jars to cool, and test the joint. 
Wrap the jars in paper to prevent bleaching.

CLASS 31— CANNING AND PRESERVING 301 



PRESERVING MEATS 

(U. S. Department of Agriculture) 

While meats may be canned successfully if directions are followed care- 
fully, it is perhaps advisable for beginners in canning to start with vegetables and 
fruits, taking up the canning of meats only after thorough familiarity with the pro- 
cess described in this bulletin has been acquired. If canned meat products are to 
be offered for sale through interstate shipment, inquiry should be made of the 
U. S. Department of Agriculture and State food regulating agencies in regard to 
the steps which must be taken to comply with the United States meat-inspection 
regulations and local laws. 

Poultry and Game Birds — Recipe No. 1 — Kill fowl and draw at once; wash carefully 
and cool; cut into convenient sections. Place in wire basket or cheesecloth and boil until 
meat can be removed from bones; remove from boiling liquid and remove meat from 
bones; pack closely into glass jars or enameled cans; fill jars with pot liquid, after it has 
been concentrated one-half; add level teaspoonful salt per quart of meat, for seasoning: 
put rubbers and caps of jars in position, not tight. Cap and tip tin cans. Sterilize (water- 
bath) 3 hours. Remove jars; tighten covers; invert to cool and test joints. Wrap jars with 
paper. 

Recipe No. 2 — Kill fowl and draw at once; wash carefully and cool; cut into con- 
venient sections; scald in boiling water and dip at once into cold water. Pack immediately 
into glass jars or enameled cans; fill with boiling water; add level teaspoonful salt per quart; 
put rubbers and caps of jars in position, not tight. Cap and tip tin cans. Sterilize (water 
bath) 3 hours. Remove jars; tighten covers; invert to cool, and test joints. Wrap jars with 
paper to prevent bleaching. 

Fresh Beef — Obtain fresh beef, cut into convenient pieces for handling (about % lb. 
in weight) , and roast or boil slowly for one-half hour. Cut into small pieces, remove 
gristle, bone, and excessive fat, and pack directly into hot glass jars; fill with gravy from the 
roasting pan or pot liquid to one-half its volume; put rubber and cap in position, not tight. 
Sterilize (w^ater-bath) 3 hours. 

Corned Beef — After beef has been properly corned for required time, remove the 
meat from the brine; soak for two hours in clear water, changing the ■water once; place in 
a wire basket and boil slowly for one-half hour; remove from the boiling water, plunge 
into cold water, and remove gristle, bone and excessive fat. Cut meat into small pieces and 
pack closely into hot glass jars or enameled cans. Put rubbers and caps of jars in position, 
not tight. Cap and tip tin cans. Sterilize (water-bath) 3 hours. 

SPECIALLY PREPARED MEATS 

Spring Chicken, Fried — After cleaning and preparing spring frys, season and fry as 
though preparing for serving directly on the table. Cook until the meat is about ^ done. 
If a whole spring chicken, break the neck and both legs and fold around body of chicken. 
Roll up tight, tie a string around the chicken, and drop this hot, partially fried product into 
hot quart glass jar or enameled tin can. A quart jar will hold two to four small chickens. 
Pour liquid from the griddle or frying pan into the container over the chicken. Place rubbers 
and caps of jars in position, not tight. Cap and tip tin cans. Sterilize (water-bath) 90 
minutes. 

In a similar way any fowl or wild game may be prepared by frying, oven-baking, 
roasting or stewing. The meat products which may be canned in this way include beef, 
pork, Hamburg steak, sausage, venison, rabbit, squirrel, raccoon, opossum, lamb and all 
types of sea-food. All may be packed after cooking three-fourths done in any desired way. 



302 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Sec. IV— Pt. 2— COOKING AND RECIPES 

Hot glass jars or enameled tin cans may be used. When the products are packed while 
hot in the containers the hot liquids, gravies, dressings, etc., or hot water, should be poured 
over them. Put rubbers and caps of jars in position, not tight. Cap and tip tin cans. 
Sterilize (water-bath) 90 minutes. Tightesi jars and invert to test joints. 

CAMP RATIONS 

Ration No. 1 — Products required for mixture: 4 lbs. rice; I lb. fresh green peppers; 
4 chili peppers; 4 cloves or 2 garlic; 4 quarts tomatoes; 1 lb. cheese (or Yi lb. butter); 1 
lb. fresh pork; 4 Spanish peppers; 8 level teaspoonfuls salt; 4 quarts water. 

Put the meat, peppers and garlic through a food chopper. Mix with tomatoes, 
water and salt. Cook on slow fire, simmering for 45 minutes. Soak rice in salted water for 
20 minutes. Rinse with cold water at once. Mix this product with the sauce without strain- 
ing. Grind or grate cheese and mix thoroughly with all the other products. 

To can this ration, the mixture should be packed in hot glass jars or tin cans while 
hot. Place rubbers and caps of jars in position, not tight. Cap and seal tin cans. Sterilize 
(water-bath) 90 minutes. Remove jars or cans; tighten glass jar covers; invert to cool 
and test joints. Wrap jars to prevent bleaching, and store. 

Ration No. 2 — Products required for mixture: 1 lb. rice or hominy, cracked; 1 tea- 
spoonful salt; 1/2 lb. bacon or chipped beef cut into small pieces; 1 lb. mixed equal parts 
carrots, onions, beans, Irish potatoes; 2 quarts water or milk (or 1 quart ^vater and 1 quart 
milk) ; ]/2 lb. sweet green peppers cut fine; 1 pint strained tomatoes; season with celery salt 
or celery seed. 

Cook rice or hominy, water or milk, and salt, in a double boiler until the rice or 
hominy is soft. Bacon or chipped beef, green peppers, and the strained tomatoes should be 
cooked or boiled separately. Then add to this mixture the 1 lb. mixture of vegetables and 
season with mixed spices. Cook this vegetable combination until done. Mix at once rice, 
bacon, green peppers, etc. Stir this well into the mixture. 

The product to be canned should be hot and thoroughly mixed. Pack mixture into 
hot glass jars or tin cans at once to one-eighth inch of top. Place rubbers and caps of jars in 
position, not tight. Seal tin cans completely. Sterilize (water-bath) 90 minutes. Remove 
jars; tighten covers; invert to cool, and test joints. Wrap and store. 

Ration No. 3 — One-Pound Pack. Products used: 8 oz. beef; 2 oz. potatoes; 2 oz. 
onions; 1 oz. carrots; I oz. beans; 2 oz. beef gravy. 

Parboil the beef in kettle with thin gravy for 30 minutes. Cut up potatoes, onions 
and carrots into small sections; add the beans. Place entire mixture into kettle; add the 
gravy, season to taste. Stir mixture and cook for 1 minutes. 

To can the mixture, pack it into hot glass jars or tin cans to one-eighth inch of top. 
Place rubbers and tops of jars in position, not tight. If using tin cans, seal completely. Ster- 
ilize (water-bath) 90 minutes. Remove jars or cans; tighten jar covers; invert to cool, and 
test joints. Wrap and store. 



JELLIES AND PRESERVES 

Preserving — (Farmers' Bulletin 853, on Home Canning) — A preserve is 
the product resulting when whole fruits are cooked in syrup until clear and transpar- 
ent. When properly made the fruit in the preserve keeps its form, is plump, tender, 
clear, and of good color, the surrounding syrup being also clear and of proper 
density. 

Cook Fruit as Little as Possible — (Farmers' Bulletin 853, on Home Canning) 

— Since long cooking injures the color and flavor of fruits it is desirable to cook delicate 
fruits such as berries for as short a time as possible. Cooling rapidly after cooking gives pre- 
serves a better color and flavor than can be secured when they are packed hot. Standing 
immersed in syrup after cooking also helps to plump them, if berry preserves are covered 
for a brief time before removing from fire and the vessel left covered while cooling the 
product will be more plump. For cooling, shallow enamel trays or pans are desirable. 

To sterilize jars place them in cold water, then heat to boiling point until ready to 
use. Cover fruit with melted paraffin as soon as fruit is cold. 

Fruit for Jelly Making — (Farmers' Bulletin 853, on Home Caiming) — The juice 
from certain fruits, such as grape, apple, crabapple, orange, kumquat, and currant is better 
suited for making a natural fruit jelly than juices from other fruits. The juices from these 
fruits contain the properties necessary for jelly making. The best fruits for jelly making con- 
tain pectin and acid. Pectin, the fundamental jelly making substance, does not exist in some 
fruits in sufficient amount to make jelly without the addition of pectin from some other 
source. The peach, strawberry, and cherry are examples of fruits which contain acid but 
are lacking in pectin. Pear, guava, and quince contain pectin but are deficient in acid. If 
the missing property be added in each of these fruits, a jelly with the color and flavor of the 
fruit selected can be made. 

When making the various jellies use a few apples with the fruit juice as it improves 
both quality and flavor. Combinations of fruit often produces far more delicious and 
unusual results than the use of one variety alone. 

Jelly Making Substance — (Cornell Reading Course) — The jelly making substance 
in fruit is obtained by cooking the fruit with water and thus extracting its juices. The 
amount of water and the time required to extract the jelly making substance depend on 
the dryness and kind of fruit. Juicy fruits, such as currents, berries, plums, and grapes, 
require little water and are quickly softened so that their juices may be extracted by heat. 
Dry fruits, such as apples and quinces, require more water and longer cooking than do juicy 
fruits. The white inner skin of oranges, lemons, and grapefruit will, if cooked in water for 
a long time, yield the jelly making substance. 

To Strain Jelly — (Farmers' Bulletin 853 on Home Canning) — As soon as the 
fruit is tender the liquid should be squeezed through a cheesecloth and then be allowed to 
drip, without pressure, through a flannel jelly bag. 

Filling Glaisses — (Farmers' Bulletin 853, on Home Canning) — After skimming 
the jelly, pour at once into hot sterilized glasses and set aside to cool. 

To Guarantee Whether Your Jelly Will Jell — By using a simple test much waste of 
sugar and spoiling of jellies can be avoided. To decide how much sugar should be used with 
different kinds of juices, put a spoonful of juice in a glass and add 1 spoonful of pure 
alcohol, shake the glass gently to mix. Pour slowly from the glass; note how the pectin or 
vegetable jelly settles. If it settles as one lump, a cup of sugar may be used for each cup of 
juice; if in several lumps use % oi a cup sugar to 1 cup of juice; if not in lumps but merely 

303 



304 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Sec. IV— Pt. 2— COOKING AND RECIPES 



settled use J/2 or less of a cup of sugar to 1 cup juice; if no formation under this test, it is 
unsuitable for jelly making and should be combined with apples or other fruits rich in pectin. 

Jams and Marmalades — (Cornell Reading Course) — If in directions for making jams 
and marmalades the jelly-making property of fruits were given greater consideration than is 
commonly the case, the product would be improved in both taste and wholesomeness. The 
object sought in making jams and marmalades is a rich, sweet product which will keep easily, 
which is not so firm as jelly and yet has something of the body of jelly, which is not so soft 
and tough as is the so-called preserve and yet has something of its softness and stickiness. 
In short, jams and marmalades should be skillfully produced crosses between jellies and 
preserves. 

Directions for Making Jams and Marmalades — (Cornell Reading Course) — Wash 
the fruit and prepare it as the kind requires. If large fruits are used, core and halve, 
quarter, slice, or chop them. If berries or grapes are used, crush them. For each quart 
of fruit use: for dry fruits, Yl to 2 cupfuls of water; for juicy fruits, J/g to '/^ cupful of 
water. Common sense must ultimately regulate the amount of water. The least amount that 
is possible for good results should be used. Simmer the fruit until it is tender and the juice 
is extracted. If seeds are to be removed, rub the cooked fruit through a colander. To 1 
quart of cooked fruit, add two-thirds to 1 quart of sugar. Acid, juicy fruits require the 
larger amount of sugar. Cook the mixture until it is thick, stirring it continuously in order 
to prevent burning, then pour it into sterilized glasses or small jars. If a jelly-like consist- 
ency is desired, cook the mixture until it jellies from the spoon. If a richer mixture is desired, 
cook it for 5 to 1 minutes longer 

RECIPES 



Sun Preserves (Cornell Reading Course) — Meth- 
od I — Fruits that lend themselves especially well to 
the following method of preserving are strawber- 
ries, cherries, white currants, and raspberries. Use 
1 pound sugar to each pound of fruit. Put a layer 
of fruit in the bottom of a preserving kettle and 
add I or 2 tablespoonfuls of water. Alternate the 
layers of sugar and fruit. Heat the mixture care- 
fully until the sugar is dissolved; avoid crushing 
the fruit if possible. Boil the mixture for from 5 
to 7 minutes, pour it in thin layers onto large 
platters, and set it in the sun for a day. It should 
thicken or jelly on the platter. After it has cooled 
and thickened, transfer it from the platter to ster- 
ilized jars» and seal or cover them w^ith paraffin. 

Method 2 — Fruits that lend themselves espe- 
cially w^ell to the following method of preserving 
are peaches, apricots, raspberries and plums. Care- 
fully wipe or pick over the fruit to be preserved. 
Cut peaches, plums, or apricots in halves, and re- 
move the pits. Spread the fruit on racks or boards 
and set it in the sun to dry for I or 2 days. The 
fruit should not be left out overnight to gacher 
moisture. Weigh the fruit and use a pound of 
either brown or white sugar to each pound of fruit. 
Pack alternate layers of fruit and sugar in jars, 
being careful to have the top layer of sugar. The 
sugar will dissolve gradually and form a thick, rich 
syrup around the fruit. The mixture should be 
kept covered, but need not be sealed. 

Fig Preserves (Farmers* Bulletin 853, on HOME 
CANNING) Six quarts figs, 2 quarts sugar, 2 



quarts water. Put the figs into a boiling soda solu- 
tion (I cup soda to 6 quarts of boiling w^ater), and 
allow figs to remain about 3 minutes. Rinse the 
figs w^ell by putting them through tw^o cold baths. 
Drain the fruit thoroughly and add gradually to the 
skimmed syrup, which has been made by boiling 
the sugar and w^ater together for 10 minutes. Cook 
rapidly until the figs are clear and tender (about 
2 hours). Carefully lift the fruit out and place in 
shallow pans. Cover the figs with the syrup and 
allow^ to stand overnight. Pack the cold figs in 
sterilized jars, fill each jar to overflow^ing v/ith the 
syrup. Cap, clamp, and process. 

Strawberry Preserves (Farmers* Bulletin 853, on 
HOME CANNING)— Two pounds berries, I I/^ 
pounds sugar, 1 cup berry juice. Pick over the 
fruit and put together all firm, perfect berries. 
Slightly heat, crush, and strain the others to obtain 
the juice. Make a syrup of the sugar and juice, 
bring to the boiling point, remove from the fire, and 
cool before adding the berries. Add the berries a 
few^ at a time. Place again over the fire and heat 
slowly to boiling. Cook rapidly to 106^ C, or 223*^ 
F. If a thermometer is not at hand, cook until 
berries are bright and transparent. Coo! and pack 
cold in sterilized jars. Process at simmering (87^ C. 
or 188'-' F.) to give best results in color and fiavor. 
For I 2-ounce or pint jars at this temperature, pro- 
cess for Yl hour. Other berries may be preserved 
in the same way. 

Watermelon Preserves ( Fa rme rs* Bulletin 853, 
on HOME CANNING) — Cut I pound watermelon 



CLASS 31— CANNING AND PRESERVING

rind into inch squares. Allow to stand overnight 
in clear water. Drain and cover with about 30'^ 
syrup (2 cupfuls sugar to I quart water). Boil 
for 25 minutes. Let stand overnight immersed in 
syrup. Next morning add juice of '/2 lemon and 
3 slices of lemon additional for each pound. Cook 
until transparent (about I hour). Let stand until 
cold. Pack, add the syrup, garnishing with slices 
of lemon, cap, and process. 

Cherry Preserves (Farmers' Bulletin 853, on 
HOME CANNING) — Four pounds of cherries, 3 
pounds sugar, 1 cupful cherry juice. Make a syrup 
of the sugar and fruit juice, cool, add seeded cher- 
ries, and cook rapidly until fruit is clear and syrup 
is of the proper consistency. If a thermometer is 
used, finish cherry preserves at I 06° to I 08° C. or 
223° F. to 226° F. Cool, pack into jars, and pro- 
cess as for other preserves. 

Apple Jelly (Farmers' Bulletin 853, on HOME 
CANNING) — One pound fruit, 2 pounds water, boil 
together for Yi \.o Y^ hour and strain. 

One pint strained juice — determine amount of 
sugar to be added by the use of the alcohol test 

previously given bring the juice to a boil, add the 

sugar and cook as rapidly as possible until the jelly 
point is reached. Remove from the fire, skim, pour 
into hot sterilized glasses, and when cold cover 
mth melted parafHn. 

Apple and Grape Jelly — Wash, core and slice 
apples with the peel left on. Take equal parts of 
apples and grapes and half as much water as fruit. 
Cook until soft, strain in jelly bag and measure 
the juice. To each cupful of juice add I cupful 
sugar. Cook the juice 20 minutes uncovered, then 
add the sugar. Cook until it jellies. 

Grape Jelly (Farmers' Bulletin 853, on HOME 
CANNING) — Four pounds grapes, I pound water; 
crush and boil together for 20 minutes, press 
through a jelly bag, and allow to drain through 
a flannel bag. 

Test the strained juice with alcohol to deter- 
mine the proportion of sugar to use. Bring the 
grape juice to boiling, add sugar, and stir until 
the sugar is dissolved. Continue the boiling until 
the jelly point is reached. Remove from the fire 
and skim. Pour into hot sterilized glasses, cool, 
and store. 

Currant Jelly — Cook currants with a little water, 
strain; add 1 pound sugar to each pint of juice; 
after it begins to boil skim well. Boil 3 minutes. 

Raspberries, plums and all other juicy fruits are 
cooked in this way. 

Dry Fruits, such as apples and quinces, are also 
cooked this way, but require more water and 
longer cooking. (See general directions.) 

Mint Jelly (Cornell Reading Course) — The best 
n\int jelly is made with the juice of slightly unripe 
apples as a basis. Wash fresh mint leaves thor- 
oughly. To I cupful of mint leaves (packed solid) 



add 1 cupful of boiling water, set the mixture on 
the back of the stove, and steep it for an hour. 
Lay a piece of cheesecloth over a bowl, pour the 
steeped mint leaves into it, twist the ends of the 
cheesecloth, and press out all moisture. To I cup- 
ful of apple juice add 1 to 2 tablespoonfuls of mint 
juice. If the mint flavor is not sufficiently pro- 
nounced add a drop or two of mint extract. Use 
Y^ cupful of sugar to each cupful of juice, and 
boil the mixture rapidly until the jelly test can be 
obtained. Just before it is poured into the scalded 
glasses, color it green with vegetable coloring 
matter. 

Blackberry Jelly (Farmers' Bulletin 853, on 
HOME CANNING) — Four pounds blackberries, 1 
pound water. 

Select 3 pounds of ripe fruit and 1 pound of 
underripe fruit, wash by running water over them, 
cap, crush, and add I pint of water and boil 1 5 
minutes. Press the pulp and strain the juice 
through a flannel bag. Determine the correct 
amount of sugar to be added by the use of the 
alcohol test. Bring the juice to a boil, add sugar 
and stir until the sugar is dissolved. Continue the 
boiling until the jelly point is reached. Remove 
from the fire and skim. Pour into hot sterilized 
glasses, seal, and store. 

Raspberry Jam — Crush the berries; for each 
quart of fruit use j/g to J/^ cupful water. Simmer 
until the juice is extracted; then add two-thirds to 

1 quart of sugar to I quart of fruit. Cook until 
thick, stirring continually to prevent burning. 
Pour into sterilized glasses or jars. (See general 
directions.) 

All sweet, juicy berries are cooked in this man- 
ner. 

Blackberries and other berries not very sweet, 
add more sugar to taste. 

Peach Jam Take ripe freestone peaches and 

slice them. For each quart of fruit use '/g to Ya 
cupful water; use as little water as possible. Sim- 
mer until tender and juice is extracted. To I quart 
of cooked fruit add two-thirds to I quart sugar, 
more if peaches are sour. Cook mixture until thick, 
stirring continually to prevent burning. Put into 
sterilized glasses or jars. (See general directions.) 

The pits and peels of the peaches may be cooked 
with the fruit until ready for the sugar, then strain 
and add sugar. They add to the jam and give a 
delicious flavor. 

Peach Butter — The poorer grade of peaches may 
be used, as they are to be crushed. Cook cider 
and sugar together until thick; allow 1 pint of the 
boiled cider to 3 quarts of peach pulp and cook 
together very slowly until thick. A little mixed 
ground spice may be added if desired. 

Peach Pickle Use 8 pounds peaches and stick 

2 or 3 cloves in each peach. Add a few sticks of 
cinnamon and cook until tender, then put them on 
platter to cool and place in jars. Pour the cold 



306 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Sec. IV— Pt. 2— COOKING AND RECIPES 



syrup over. Let stand 24 hours, then seal up. 

This rule applies for all kinds of fruit pickles, 
using more or less sugar, according to the fruit 
used. 

Cranberry Conserve — Chop 5 pounds cranber- 
ries, together with 2 pounds raisins. Boil the 
rind of 3 oranges until tender, chop fine and mix 
with the cranberry mixture; add 10 cupfuls sugar, 
the pulp and strained juice of the oranges. Cook 
slowly until about as thick as marmalade. 

Orange Marmalade (Cornell Reading Course) — 
Twelve thin-skinned oranges, 3 lemons. 

Wash and slice the fruit as thin as paper or 
grind it fine. For every quart of fruit add 1 |/2 
quarts of water and let the mixture stand over- 
night. In the morning cook it slowly until tender, 
about 2 to 2 J/2 hours. Measure the cooked fruit, 
and add an equal amount of sugar. Cook the 
mixture until it jellies from a spoon, about 30 to 
60 minutes. 



Grapefruit Marmalade (Cornell Reading Course) 

— Wash grapefruit thoroughly, remove the seeds, 
and run it through a chopper. Barely cover it with 
water, and let it stand overnight. In the morning 
boil it for 30 minutes and let it stand overnight. 
On the third morning boil it for 30 or 40 minutes, 
or until the white part of the fruit is very tender. 
Measure the fruit, add an equal quantity of sugar, 
and boil the mixture until it jellies from the spoon, 
about 30 to 60 minutes. Pour the marmalade into 
hot sterilized glasses or small jars and cover it 
with parafiin. 

Such extended preparation previous to cooking 
the fruit with sugar is given in order to soften the 
white of the fruit and extract from it the jelly- 
making substance. 

Grape Conserve (Cornell Reading Course) — ' 
Mix 3 pounds seeded grapes, 3 pounds sugar 
and I pound English walnuts broken into small 
pieces. Cook them together as for jam. The 
juice of I orange and the peel of ^/i orange cut 
in small pieces may be added for variation.

DRYING FRUITS AND VEGETABLES IN THE HOME 

(From Farmers' Bulletin No. 841, U. S. Department of Agriculture) 

"CONDITIONING" DRIED PRODUCTS 

RECIPES 

It will be found advisable to "condition" practically all dried vegetables and 
fruits. This is best done in a small way by placing the material in boxes and pour- 
ing it from one box into another once a day for three or four days, so as to mix it 
thoroughly and give to the whole mass an even degree of moisture. If the material 
is found to be too moist, it should be returned to the drying trays for a short drying. 



Many of the products for which directions are 
given here may be dried either without or with 
preliminary blanching. In such cases both meth- 
ods are described. Alternate methods are desig- 
nated by letters. 

RECIPES 

Sweet Com — Only very young and tender corn 
should be used for drying, and it should be pre- 
pared at once after gathering. 

(a) Cook in boiling water 2 to 5 minutes, long 
enough to set the milk. Cut the kernels from the 
cob with a sharp knife, taking care not to cut ofl 
pieces of the cob. Spread thinly on trays, and 
place in position to dry. Stir occasionally until 
dry. 

(b) Boil or steam on the cob 8 to 10 minutes 
to set the milk. To improve flavor a teaspoonful 
of salt to a gallon of water may be used. Drain 
well and cut corn from cob, using a very sharp 
and flexible knife. Cut grains fine, only half-way 
down to the cob, and scrape out the remainder of 
grain, being careful not to scrape off any of the 
chaff next to the cob. Dry from 3 to 4 hours 
at I 10° to 115° F. When field corn is used, good. 
plump roasting-ear stage is the proper degree of 
ripeness. A pound of dried corn per dozen ears 
i* an average yield. 

(c) The corn may be dried in the sun. Dry in 
oven 10 to 15 minutes and finish drying in the 
sun. Sun-drying, of course, is not satisfactory in 
moist weather. 

Pack in cartons or boxes for a few days to 
"condition." 

String or Snap Beans — All varieties of string 
beans can be dried, but only beans in ideal condi- 
tion for table use should be selected for this pur- 
pose. 

(a) Wash, remove stem, tip, and "strings." Cut 
or break the beans into pieces Yl t° ' >nch long, 
and place on trays and dry. They also can be run 
through the slicer and then dried quickly. 

(b) Prepare as directed above, but instead of 
cutting the beans, thread them on coarse, strong 
thread, making long "necklaces" of them, and hang 
them above the stove or out of doors until dry. 
An old-fashioned recipe calls for boiling the pods 
until nearly cooked through before drying. 



(c) Wash and string beans carefully. The very 
young and tender beans can be dried \vhole. Those 
that are full grown should be cut in one-fourth to 
1 inch lengths with vegetable slicer or a sharp 
knife. It is beter to cut beans than to snap them. 
They are then put in a bag of cheesecloth or in a 
wire basket and blanched in boiling water for 6 to 
10 minutes, depending on the maturity of the bean. 
One-half teaspoonful of soda may be added to each 
gallon of boiling water to help set the green color 
in the beans. Remove surface moisture by placing 
between two towels or by exposing to the sun and 
air for a short time. Dry young string beans 2 
hours, more matured beans 3 hours. Begin drying 
at temperature of 110° F. and raise temperature 
gradually to 145° F. 

Wax beans are dried in the same manner as the 
green string beans. "Condition" as described. 

Lima Beans — Lima beans can be shelled from 
the pod and dried. If gathered before maturity 
>vhen young and tender, wash and blanch from 5 
to 1 minutes. Length of time for blanching de- 
pends upon size and maturity of beans. Remove 
surface moisture and dry from 3 to 3 ^ hours at 
same temperature as string beans. 

Dry Shelled Beans (Important in the South) — 

Beans of different kinds, after maturing and drying 
on the vines, can be treated as follows; Shell, 
wash, spread in thin layers on the trays of the 
dryer, and heat 1 minutes, beginning at 1 60° F. 
and gradually raising the temperature to 180° F. 
This high temperature is for the purpose of de- 
stroying all insect eggs that may be on the beans. 
Cowpeas or any field pea can be treated in the 
same way. Cool and store carefully. It might be 
added that the heating of the bean or pea destroys 
its vitality. When so treated it cannot be used for 
seed. 

Okra — (a) Small, tender pods sometimes are 
strung on a stout thread and hung over the stove 
to dry. If dried in that manner, heat in oven be- 
fore storing on trays. 

(b) Wash, blanch 3 minutes in boiling soda 
water, and dry 2 to 3 hours at 110° to 140° F. 
Use J/2 teaspoonful soda to a gallon of water. Dry 



309 



3 1 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Sec. IV— Pt. 2— COOKING AND RECIPES 



young and small tender pods whole. Older pods 
should be cut in J4-inch slices. 

Peppers (a) Peppers may be dried by splitting 

on one side, removing seed, drying in the air, and 
finishing the drying in the drier at 140° F. A more 
satisfactory method is to place peppers in biscuit 
pan in oven and heat until skin blisters, or to 
steam peppers until skin softens, peel, split in half, 
take out seed, and dry at 1 1 0° to I 40° F. In dry- 
ing thick-fleshed peppers like the pimento, do not 
increase heat too quickly, but dry slowly and 
evenly. 

(b) Small varieties of red peppers may be 
spread in the sun until wilted and the drying fin- 
ished in the dryer, or they may be dried entirely 
in the sun. 

(c) Peppers often are dried whole. If they are 
large they can be strung on stout thread; if small, 
the whole plant can be hung up to dry. 

Pea* — (a) Shell and spread on trays and dry. 

(b) Shell full-grown peas with nonedible pod, 
blanch the peas from 3 to 5 minutes, remove sur- 
plus moisture, spread in single layer on trays, and 
dry from 3 to 3'/2 hours. Begin drying at 110° 
F., raising temperature very slowly in about I Y^ 
hours to 145° F. Continue drying I '/i o^ 2 hours 
at 145° F. 

(c) Shell full-grown peas, passing through a 
meat grinder, spread on trays, and dry. Whole 
peas take longer to dry, but when cooked 
they resemble fresh peas. The ground peas dry 
more quickly, but make a product which can be 
used successfully only in the preparation of soup 
or puree. 

(d) When drying the very young and tender 
sugar peas, use the pod also. Wash and cut in '/4- 
inch pieces. Blanch in boiling water 6 minutes. 
Remove surplus moisture and dry the same length 
of time and at the same temperature as string beans. 
it is not necessary to use soda when blanching 
peas. 

Pack a^vay and "condition." 

GARDEN BEETS, ONIONS, LEEKS, CARROTS, 
TURNIPS, PARSNIPS, CABBAGE 

Beets — (a) Select young, quickly grown, tender 
beets. Wash, peel, slice about '/g inch thick, and 
dry. 

(b) Boil the whole beets with skin until a little 
more than three-fourths done. Dip in cold water, 
peel, and slice into '/e or '/^-inch slices. Dry 2J/2 
to 3 hours at 110° to 150° F. 

Turnips Turnips should be treated in the same 

v^ray as beets. 

Carrots — ^Varieties having a large, woody core 
should be avoided. 

(a) Wash, peel, slice lengthwise into pieces 
about Yi inch thick, and dry. 

(b) Clean, scrape, or pare, and slice into J/g- 
inch slices. Blanch 6 minutes, remove surface 



moisture, and dry lYl to 3 hours. Begin drying 
at 110° F., and raise temperature gradually to 
150° F. 

Parsnips, kohlrabi, celeriac, and salsify are dried 
by the same methods. 

Onions — (a) Select well-matured onions and re- 
move the outside papery covering. Cut off tops and 
roots. Slice into J/g-inch pieces and dry quickly. 
Store in a light-proof container to avoid discolora- 
tion. 

(b) Wash, peel, and slice onions into Yt ^'* Vi' 
inch slices. To avoid any unpleasantness, peel and 
slice while holding under water Blanch in boiling 
water 5 minutes. Remove surface moisture and 
dry 2'/2 to 3 hours, beginning at 110° F. and 
raising temperature gradually to 140° F. 

Leeks are handled in a similar manner, cut into 
V^-inch strips and dried. 

Cabbage — (a) Select well-developed heads of 
cabbage and remove all outside leaves. Split the 
cabbage, remove the hard, woody core, slice the 
remainder of the head with a kraut cutter or slicer, 
and dry. 

(b) Shred or cut into strips a few inches long. 
Blanch I minutes, drain, remove surface moisture, 
and dry 3 hours at 110° to 145° F. 

All these products should be "conditioned." 

Spinach and Parsley — Spinach that is in prime 
condition for greens should be prepared by care- 
fully washing and removing the leaves from the 
roots. Spread the leaves on trays to dry thor- 
oughly. Slicing will greatly facilitate drying. 

Parsley should be treated in the same way as 
spinach. 

BEET TOPS. SWISS CHARD, CELERY, AND 
RHUBARB 
Beet Top* — ^Tops of young beets in suitable con- 
dition for greens should be selected and 'washed 
carefully. Both the leafstalk and the blade should 
be cut into sections about '/^ inch long, spread on 
screens, and dried. 

Swiss Chard and Celery should be prepared in 
the same way as beet tops. Celery also may be 
prepared in the same way as pumpkins and summer 
squash. 

Rhubarb Choose young and succulent growth. 

Prepare as for stewing, by skinning the leafstalks 
and cutting into pieces about '/i inch to Yl inch 
in length. Do not use the blade of the leaf. 

All these products should be "conditioned." 

POTATOES 

Irish Potatoes Select good, sound, well-ma- 
tured potatoes. 

(a) Wash and boil or steam until nearly done. 
Peel and pass through a meat grinder or 
a potato ricer. Collect the shreds in layers on a 
tray and dry until brittle. If toasted slightly in an 
oven when dry the flavor is improved somewhat. 



CLASS 31— DRYING FRUITS AND VEGETABLES IN THE HOME 



311 



(b) Boil or steam until nearly done, peel a> 
above, cut into J^'''"^^' slices, spread on trays, and 
dry until brittle. 

Peeling may be omitted, but the product will be 
very much inferior in flavor. 

Sweet Potatoes — Select sound, mature roots. 

(a) Wash, boil until nearly done, peel, and run 
through the meat chopper. Spread on trays and 
dry until brittle. 

(b) Treat as above, but slice instead of running 
through the meat chopper. 

(c) Wash, peel, slice, spread on trays, and dry. 
A somewhat brighter product will result if the 
sliced potato is dipped in salt water just before 
drying. 

MISCELLANEOUS 
Cauliflower — Clean, divide in small bunches, 
blanch 6 minutes, and dry 2 to 3 hours at 110° 
to 145° F. Cauliflower will turn very dark when 
drying, but will regain part of the color in soaking 
and cooking. Dried cauliflower is especially good 
in soups and omelets. 

Brussels Sprouts may be handled in a similar 
way, but add a pinch of soda to the blanching 
water. 

Pumpkins and Squash — (a) Select sound, well- 
grown specimens. Cut into strips; peel these; re- 
move all seeds and the soft part surrounding them. 
Cut strips into smaller bits not over Y4 inch thick 
and 2 inches long, and dry. 

(b) Pare and cut into about j/j-inch strips and 
blanch 3 minutes. Remove surface moisture and 
dry slowly from 3 to 4 hours, raising temperature 
from 110° to 140° F. 

Pack and "condition." 

Soup Mixtures Each vegetable used in the soup 

mixture is prepared and dried separately. They 
are put together in proportions desired, the pre- 
ferred flavoring vegetables predominating. A com- 
bination of several vegetables makes the most de- 
sirable soup mixture. Those most often used are 
carrots, cabbage, onions, celery, potatoes, and okra. 

Herb* — Celery tops, parsley, mint, sage, and 
herbs of all kinds need not be blanched, but should 
be washed well and dried in the sun or in the 
dryer. These are good for flavoring soups, purees, 
gravies, omelets, etc. 

Apples, Pears and Quinces — Early varieties and 
sweet apples are not well adapted to drying. Win- 
ter apples should be used for this purpose. 

(a) Peel, core, trim and slice '/^ inch thick. Dip 
in weak salt solution containing 8 teaspoonfuls of 
salt to I gallon of water. Spread on trays and 
dry. It is only necessary to dry apples long enough 
for them to become tough and somewhat leathery. 

(b) Pare, core, and cut into eighths, or core 
and slice in rings, using fruit or vegetable slicer. 
As apples discolor quickly, do not let them stand 
long before drying. To prevent discoloration, as 



the fruit is prepared it may be dipped for I min- 
ute in a cold salt bath, using I ounce of salt to 1 
gallon of water. Remove surplus moisture and 
dry at 110° to 150° F., raising temperature grad- 
ually. Dry from 4 to 6 hours, and longer if neces- 
sary. 

Pears are dried in the same way as apples. They 
may be steamed 10 minutes before drying. 

Quices are treated in the same way as pears. 

Pack and "condition." 

Raspberries — (a) Sort out imperfect berries, 
spread the selected berries on trays, and dry. Do 
not dry so long that they become hard enough to 
rattle. The drying should be stopped as soon as 
the berries fail to stain the hand when pressed. 

(b) Pick leaves and stems from fruits and spread 
on trays. Handle carefully and do not bruise. 
Spread in thin layer on tray and dry slowly. Raise 
temperature gradually from 110° to 125° F. in 
about 2 hours. Do not raise temperature higher 
than 130° F. until a considerable portion of the 
moisture has evaporated, as otherwise expansion 
will occur and juice will be lost by dripping. This 
is accompanied by loss of flavor and color. Finish 
drying berries at 140° F. for 2 to 3 hours. It is 
necessary to dry berries from 4 to 5 hours. 

Blackberries, dewberries, and huckleberries can 
be dried in the same way as raspberries. 

Pack and "condition." 

Peaches Peaches usually are dried unpeeled, 

but they will be better if peeled before drying. 

(a) Remove the stones, cut the fruit into halves, 
or preferably into smaller pieces, and spread on 
trays to dry. 

(b) Cut in halves, pit, lay in trays pit side up, 
and dry at same temperature and for same length 
of time as apples. 

Peaches should be packed carefully and "condi- 
tioned." 

Plums and Apricots — (a) Plums are not peeled, 
but the pits are removed, the fruit being cut into 
halves and dried in the same way as peaches. 

(b) Select medium-ripe plums, cover with boil- 
ing water, cover the vessel and let stand 20 min- 
utes. Small, thin-fleshed varieties are not suitable 
for drying. Drain, remove surface moisture, and 
dry from 4 to 6 hours, gradually raising temper- 
ature from 110° to 150° F. 

Apricots are handled in the same way as plums. 

Pack and "condition." 

Cherries — (a) Remove stems of cherries and, 
if the fruit is large, the pits also. Spread out on 
trays to dry. Small, black cherries can be dried 
when containing the stones. 

(b) Wash, remove surface moisture, and spread 
cherries, unseeded, in thin layer on trays. If cher- 
ries are seeded there will be a loss of juice. Dry 
from 2 to 4 hours at 110° to 150° F. Raise tem- 
perature gradually. 

Pack and "condition."

PRECAUTIONS AGAINST INSECTS 
ATTACKING DRIED PRODUCTS 

From Farmer's Bulletin 841, U. S. Department of Agriculture 

Two kinds of" moths stand out prominently among insects that attack dried 
fruits and vegetables. They are much more Hkely to get into the fruit during the 
process of drying than to find their way through boxes into the products stored 
inside them. This applies particularly to drying in the sun. 

A small moth called the Indian-meal moth is the most destructive insect that at- 
tacks such products. It is about three-eights of an inch long and has a cloaked appearance, 
one third gray and the rest copper brown. The fig moth is about the same size but dark 
neutral gray. A minute flattened chocolate-brown beetle usually accompanies these moths 
and does considerable damage. Both of the moths deposit their eggs on fruit when it is on 
the drying racks — generally at dusk or after dark, as they are not fond of daylight. It 
takes from three to ten days for the eggs to hatch into whitish or pinkish grublike cater- 
pillars and from five to ten weeks from the laying of the eggs till the appearance of the moths 
to lay another lot of eggs; and since a number of "broods" or generations are produced 
yearly, if a few of these moth eggs are stored away on dried fruits or vegetables, hundreds 
of caterpillars are produced and many pounds of valuable material may be destroyed during 
the course of the winter if it is stored in a warm room. Warm, dark bins or dried fruit in 
sacks offer especially favorable places for their development. It is evident that the larger 
the amount of material in a package, the greater the chance of a few eggs doing a great 
deal of damage. Small cartons or containers have the advantage of confining the injury 
from these moths to small quantities of material, if the containers are closed tightly. 

In sun drying, if the drying racks are screened early in the evening and at night, the 
cheesecloth or fly-screen battened down, and the dried fruits and vegetables stored in tight 
paper sacks in a cool place, no danger ordinarily need be feared from these insects. As 
an additional precaution, the dried product, before being stored, may be heated to 1 40° F. 
long enough to allow the heat to penetrate throughout. TTiis will sterilize it if already in- 
fected. 

In drying by artificial heat, the process itself ordinarily will sterilize the product. 
But after drying it should be stored promptly, to prevent infestation. 

PACKING AND STORING ucts when protected from insects and rodents. 

Although not necessary, tin cans or glass jars The dried fruit or vegetables must be protected 



make good receptacles for storage of dried fruits 



from the outside moisture and will keep best in a 

cool, dry, well-ventilated place. These conditions, 

or vegetables. Pasteboard boxes with tight covers, i j .a; i. . l. • ■ ,l u -J 

^ ^ however, are dimcult to obtain in the more humid 

stout paper bags, and patented paraffin paper car- regions, and there moisture-tight containers should 

tons also afford ample protection for dried prod- be used.

THE KEEPING OF VEGETABLES, FRUITS AND MEATS 

(From Bulletin No. 375, by Mrs. Mary Hinman Abel, published by the U. S. Department 

of Agriculture) 

CARE OF FOOD IN THE HOME 

The following hints regarding the keeping of different kinds of foods may 
be found useful: 



Potatoes are kept without difficulty in a cool, 
dry and dark place. Sprouts should not be allowed 
to grov? in the spring. 

Such roots as carrots, parsnips and turnips re- 
main plump and fresh if placed in earth or sand 
filled boxes on the cellar floor. 

Sweet Potatoes may be kept until January if 
cleaned, dried, and packed in chaff so that they will 
not touch each other. 

Pumpkin* and Squash must be thoroughly ripe 
and mature to keep well. They should be dried 
from time to time with a cloth and kept not on the 
cellar floor but on a shelf and well separated from 
each other. 



Cabbages are to be placed in barrels, with the 
roots uppermost. 

Celery should be neither trimmed or washed, 
but packed, heads up, in long, deep boxes, which 
should then be filled with dry earth. 

Tomatoes may be kept until January, if gathered 
just before frost, wiped dry, and placed on straw- 
covered racks in the cellar. They should be firm 
and well-grown specimens, not yet beginning to 
turn. As they ripen they may be taken out for 
table use, and any soft or decaying ones must be 
removed. 

Apples, if for use during the autumn, may be 
stored in barrels without further precaution than 
to look them over now and then to remove decay- 
ing ones; but if they are to be kept till late winter 
or spring they must be of a variety known to keep 
well and they must be hand-picked and without 
blemish or bruise. They should be wiped dry and 
placed with little crowding on shelves in the cellar. 
As a further precaution they may be wrapped sep- 
arately in soft paper. 

Pears may be kept for a limited time in the 
same way, or packed in sawdust or chaff, which 
absorbs the moisture which might otherwise favor 
molding. 

Oranges and Lemons are kept in the same way. 
Wrapping in soft paper is here essential, as the un- 

MEATS 



covered skins, if bruised, offer good feeding ground 
for mold. Oranges may be kept for a long time 
in good condition if stored where it is very cold 
but where freezing is not possible. Lemons and 
limes are often kept in brine, an old-fashioned 
household method. 

Cranberries, after careful looking over to remove 
soft ones, are placed in a crock or firkin and 
covered with water. A plate or round board 
placed on top and weighted serves to keep the ber- 
ries under water. The water should be changed 
once a month. 

In winter, large pieces of fresh meat may be pur- 
chased and hung in the cellar. Thin pieces, as 
mutton chops, are sometimes dipped in mutton suet, 
which keeps the surface from drying and is easily 
scraped off before cooking. 



Smoked Ham, Tongue, Beef and Fish are best 
put in linen bags and hung in the cellar. 

Salt Pork or Corned Beef should be kept in brine 
in suitable jars, kegs or casks, and should be 
weighted so as to remain well covered. A plate or 
board weighted is a satisfactory device. 

Eggs may be packed for winter use in limewater 
or in water-glass solution. Many housekeepers 
have good success packing them in bran, in oats, 
or in dry salt, but the preference is to be given to 
10% solution of water-glass. Exclusion of the air 
with its accompanying micro-organisms and the 
prevention of drying out are what is sought in all 
cases. Packed eggs are not equal to fresh eggs 
in flavor, but when they are well packed are of 
fairly good quality and perfectly \vholesome. 

Washing Eggs — The ordinary way to break an 
egg is to hit it against another egg or over the 
edge of the mixing bowl and let the contents stream 
over the side of the shell without considering 
vsrhether the latter is clean or not. Even if there 
is no visible dirt, the shell may not be as clean as 
it seems, for it may have come from a dirty nest 
or have been untidily handled. Eggs should always 
be washed before breaking. 



When meat is received the skin side should be 
rubbed with a cloth wet in hot water and then 
carefully scraped with a knife. The thin outer 
skin of lamb should be entirely removed in order 
to avoid the disagreeable taste due to any contact 
with the hair of the animal. The cut surface 



should also be carefully scraped, and to prevent 
drying, be covered with paraffin paper or rubbed 
with salad oil, or in case the meat is to be kept for 
some time, entirely covered with melted suet. The 
meat should then be put on a plate in the ice-box.

CLASS 31— KEEPING VEGETABLES. FRUITS AND MEATS 



315 



POULTRY 



The skin of poultry is frequently very dirty when 
brought from market, and fowls should be not only 
washed, but scrubbed with a soft brush and warm 
water in which a teaspoonful of baking soda has 
been dissolved. Such treatment will prevent the 
disagreeable "henny" taste often noticeable in 
cooked poultry. 

Poultry should be drawn immediately, and un- 
less it is known to have been killed very recently, 
it should be thoroughly washed on the inside and 
used soon. Poultry that is drawn directly after 
killing, on the contrary, keeps better if it is not 



washed until used. It should be hung in a cold 
place or put in the ice-box with a piece of char- 
coal inside the body. 

Cold-storage chickens should under no circum- 
stances remain in a warm room before cooking. 
Such poultry must be kept at a low temperature 
and cooked as soon as possible. All cold-storage 
food, when brought into a warm temperature, 
spoils quickly, and without doubt many cases of 
illness traced to the use of .such food are really due 
to careless handling and delay in cooking.

SEASONAL MENUS 

American housekeepers are facing not only very high prices for all foods but a de- 
cided shortage of some staple articles such as white flour and potatoes. 

Very careful planning will be necessary to feed a famliy properly on an average in- 
come during this period of scarcity. Food must be chosen with a view to its value in the 
diet and needs rather than wants must be considered A diet so limited tends to be rather 
monotonous and special care must be taken to have the cooking and serving carefully done. 

A garden is a valuable asset and provides flavor and variety in the diet at a rea- 
sonable cost. If surplus vegetables are canned for winter use the advantage will be still 
greater. 

The following menus have been planned with a view to using garden products when 
they are in season, and it is assumed that the housekeeper has access to a vegetable gar- 
den and some home grown fruit.

id THEIR CARE 



KEEP HOUSE 'THE PAPER WAY" 

There is no other way in which there is more labor saving 
and economy than in the use of the many modern paper articles 
that have come into use the past few years. 

Paper ToweU, bought in a roll, used once and thrown away, are cheaper 
than the laundry cost alone of linen or cotton towels, are more convenient and 
vastly more sanitary, and serve almost all purposes except for bath where a hard 
rub is desired. Have a roll in kitchen as well as in bath room. Such towels can 
be used in many other ways than drying the hands, such as laying on the table 
when about to "bread" croquettes or prepare fish, to dry meat or fish for draining, 
or soaking up an article fried in fat, making a bag for lettuce, covering cold meats, 
and many other purposes. 

Paper Plates, which can be had paraffined or not, serve countless uses. 
Paper dishes are obtainable. Paper receptacles are especially desirable for an ice 
box. 

Paper Doilies and Napkins are bright and attractive and fit in better than 
linens or drawn work in many instances. They can be had in fancy sets complete 
to match. 

Paper Jelly Glaisses are better in many ways than glass ones. They are 
fitted with tops which are sealed with paraffin and are air tight; they are econom- 
ical and are not subject to breakage. They make most convenient molds for gela- 
tin as they can be had in sizes almost as tiny as thimbles, for aspics and desserts. 

Paper Filter — For clearing soups, and various purposes, use a soft, thick 
paper, like blotting paper, which comes prepared for filter purposes. 

The Paper Dishrag of tough fabric will last two weeks and can be burned. 
The paper ice-blanket saves ice. The paper shelf-roll saves lots of mental agony. 

A large paper bag used to line the garbage pail keeps the pail clean and is 
most sanitary.

THE 

To Flush a Sink Trap — (Cornel! Reading 
Course) — Apparatus: an old granite or iron pot, 
a granite funnel, a stick, and one-third cup wash- 
ing soda for each sink. 

Put the soda in the pot, add a quart of water 
for each one-third cup of soda. Bring it to a boil, 
stirring to dissolve the soda but only with a stick 
that can be thrown away afterwards. 

Put the funnel in the sink plug-hole and pour 
down the quart of boiling soda water. Be careful 
not to let the soda get on hands or drain boards. 
Leave the pot, stick and funnel in the sink. 

See that no water goes down the sink for half 
an hour. 

Plug the sink and fill it with water, hot if pos- 
sible. Then remove the plug and let the rush of 
water finish cleaning out the trap. 

Rinse, dry and put away the funnel, pot and 
other implements and leave everything tidy at the 
sink. 

Every sink and trap in the house should have 
this treatment at least once a week. 



SINK 

To Clean a Sink Trap — (Cornell Reading 

Course) Apparatus: an empty garbage pail, an 

old, small sieve, the trap brush, a monkey wrench, 
an old pot, and one-fourth cup ^vashing soda. 

Put the soda into the pot, add two quarts of 
water, and boil. 

Set the pail under the trap and unscrew the cap 
at bottom of the S-trap. 

Remove any obstruction that may be there, and 
brush out both sides of the trap pipe with the trap 
brush. 

Pour the soda solution down the sink, put on the 
screw cap: put sieve in sink, empty the contents of 
the pail through it, then empty the contents of the 
sieve into the stove. 

Plug the sink, fill it with water, and wash the 
sieve, garbage pail, and trap brush. Then let the 
water away in order to flush the trap. While it is 
running away, examine the trap to make sure that 
it is not leaking at the screw. 



THE 

To Blacklead a Kitchen Stove — (Cornell Read- 
ing Course) Apparatus: the blacklead plate, the 

turpentine bottle, a dauber, a black-lead brush, 
black lead, soap, an old flannel cloth, a pail of hot 
water, and a stove apron. 

Put on the stove apron, mix the black lead with 
enough water (warm) to make it the consistency 
of cream, then add a few drops of turpentine. 

Wet the cloth, rub it on the cake of soap, and 
wash the stove all over with it. Rinse the cloth 
and renew the soap as often as necessary. The 
object is to get rid of old blacking and grease, and 
so to make the surface easier to polish. Soda 
water is an excellent substitute for soap if the stove 
is very greasy or has been neglected. 

Let the stove dry. 

Commence at the top of the stove and with the 
dauber apply a thin layer of blacking to one sec- 
tion of the stove and polish immediately with the 
black-lead brush; then proceed to blacken and 
polish the next section. If the blacking is allowed 
to dry before the brushing the polish is harder to 
obtain; therefore, daub only as much as can be 
polished before it dries out. 

Fireplace baskets and irons do not require wash- 
ing very often. 

Note: It is now considered good practice to oil 
kitchen stoves, thus avoiding the labor and dust of 
the blackleading process. 

To Oil a Kitchen Stove — (Cornell Reading 
Course) — Apparatus and directions together: Put a 
little separator oil on a wad of cotton waste and 
rub it on all the iron parts of the stove. 



STOVE 

Rub oflf with fresh waste, an old cloth, or some 
crumpled paper. 

Polish vfith a dry flannelette or w^oolen cloth un- 
til all oiliness ia gone. 

Bum the waste, old cloth, or paper. Be Par- 
ticular about this because oily waste and oily clotha 
are a frequent cause of fire through spontaneous 
combustion. 

Wash out the polishing cloth. 

To Clean a Gas Stove Thoroughly — ( Cornell 
Reading Course) — Apparatus: a stove apron, a 
couple of old newspapers, a wire sink-brush, a 
monkey-wrench, whisk, dustpan and brush, a sink 
tow^el, several pieces of old cloth, soap and w^ash- 
ing soda, and the separator-oil bottle. 

Put on the apron and spread the papers on the 
table. 

Turn off the gas at the main supply pipe with 
the monkey wrench. 

Fill a large dishpan with strong, hot soapsuds, 
put into it to soak the dripping pan and rack and 
any movable nickel pieces of the stove. 

Fill the sink half full of strong, hot soda water. 
Put the drop tray in the bottom to soak, and on 
top of it put the top grates, doors and all movable 
parts of the stove. 

Brush out both ovens and all parts of the stove 
frame. 

Wet one of the old cloths in hot water, rub it on 
the soap, and wash off the stove. Dry it, if nec- 
essary, wth an old cloth. Then oil the black parts 
very lightly with the separator oil and polish it off 
thoroughly with another old dry cloth. 

Let the soda water out of the sink, let in fresh 
warni water, and scrub the doors and other black 



CONVENIENCES— CLEANING AND CARE

pieces with the wire brush. Dry them off, take 
them to the table, oil and polish them, and put them 
back on the stove. 

Let the dirty water out of the sink, transfer the 
nickel pieces, dripping pan and rack to the sink, 
pour in the soapy water, scrub the pieces thor- 
oughly, dry them with the sink towel, and return 
them to place. 

Scrub, rinse, dry and return to place the drop 
tray. 



Burn the old cloths and wash the sink out care- 
fully. It is especially necessary to be careful about 
burning oily cloths that are not washed after using, 
because they have been known to take fire spon- 
taneously and are therefore dangerous when tucked 
into corners out of sight. 

Note: Be sure to have the stove all put together 
before any oiling is done.

MICE, INSECTS, VERMIN 

HOUSEHOLD INSECTS AND METHODS OF CONTROL 

(Extracts from Bulletin under above title, being Sanitation Series No. 3, Cornell Reading 
Course, New York State College of Agriculture, Ithaca, N. Y.) 



THE HOUSE FLY 

It has been conclusively shown that house flies carry the germs of cholera, 
typhoid fever, cholera infantum, and tropical dysentery, on their feet, legs and 
bodies and in their digestive tracts. There can be no doubt of the responsibility of 
the house fly for much sickness and many deaths. 



Where Flies Breed — The main breeding-places 
of house flies are in piles of stable manure, espe- 
cially horse manure, in rotting straw and manure 
lying in stables and barnyards, in the kitchen refuse 
of garbage cans and barrels, in manure piles about 
pigpens and poultry houses, in human excrement 
lying in the pits of loose or open closets, and, in 
fact, in almost any decaying vegetable matter that 
lies long enough in one place to ferment and decay. 



The fact should be emphasized that the most dan- 
gerous breeding-place for flies is in open closets; 
for in these places the germs of typhoid fever, 
dysentery, and cholera infantum are found. By all 
means the pits of closets should be tight and dark 
so that no flies will enter them; and the contents 
should be kept covered with fine ashes or dirt. In 
addition, the pits should be cleaned rather often 
and the contents carefully buried far from wells 
and springs of water. 



METHODS OF CONTROL 



Treatment of Manure Piles — Chlorid of lime, at 
the rate of I pound of lime to 8 quarts of manure, 
will kill the maggots if it is thoroughly mixed with 
the manure. Unfortunately, this treatment is ex- 
pensive; the chlorin fumes from treated manure 
irritate the eyes of livestock, and it is not certain 
whether or not the chlorid of lime destroys the 
fertilizing value of the manure. 

Kerosene oil will kill the maggots, but too much 
of it is required for its use to be economical. Lime 
has been used for this purpose, and has not proved 
an efficient destroyer of the maggots. 

It has been found by J. J. Davis that a solution 
of iron sulfate, 2 pounds in a gallon of water, or 
2 J/2 pounds of dry sulfate per horse each day, will 
kill the maggots when mixed with the manure. 
Iron sulfate is so cheap that it will not cost more 
than 2 cents per day for I horse; and in addition 
it will completely deodorize the manure. 

The Storage and Removal of Manure — It has 
been shown that flies prefer light, open places in 
which to breed and that they rarely enter dark 
rooms to deposit their eggs. It is therefore wise to 
build a dark, well-screened room or a tight cement 
pit in which manure can be stored for a long time 
or from which, if preferred, it can be removed once 
or twice a week. In the country, where it is pre- 
ferred to remove the manure once or twice a week 
rather than to store it, it should be drawn to the 
fields and scattered thinly over the surface. If the 
manure is left in piles or in large lumps there is 



still danger of its serving as a breeding-place for 
flies. 

The Box Privy — Flies that come from the privy 
are the most dangerous. Not only do they bring 
germs to our tables, but they are likely to con- 
taminate the milk that may be used for feeding 
children. 

There is no longer any excuse for the old, open 
box privy, cleaned once a year. It is a menace to 
the whole household and to the neighborhood as 
well. The pit must be fly-proof and, in addition, 
the contents should be carefully covered each day 
with a liberal supply of fine road dust or sifted 
ashes. Finally, the pit should be emptied as often 
as possible and the contents should be buried far 
from wells and springs of drinking water. 

Fly Traps Every one is familiar with the dif- 
ferent types of wire fly traps. Many of them are 
excellent and their use is recommended. 

Insect Powder — A powder known as pyrethrum, 
Persian insect powder, or buhach, is sold for killing 
all kinds of household insects, Buhach is a Cali- 
fornia product, and is more likely to be fresh than 
the imported Persian product. There is no more 
satisfactory way of ridding a kitchen of house flies 
than by the use of this powder. At night all the 
doors and windows of the kitchen should be closed; 
fresh powder should be sprinkled over the stove, 
on the window ledges, tables, and in the air. In the 
morning flies will be found lying around dead or 
stupefied. They may then be swept up and burned.

Bichromate of Potash — This is a substance often 
used for killing flies. It is not a virulent poison, 
and little danger is incurred in putting it about the 
room. It should be dissolved in water at the rate 
of I part of potash to 2 parti of water, and should 
then be set about the room in shallow dishes. If 
the room can be darkened with the exception of 
one window, and the solution placed on the ledge 
of this window in the light, quicker results will be 
obtained. 

Formaldehyde — One of the best solutions for at- 
tracting and killing flies is a dilute mixture of for- 
maJdehyde (40 per cent) and water. Two table- 
spoonfuls in a pint of equal parts of milk and water, 
set about the room in plates, will attract the Hies 
and kill many of them, provided there is no other 
food or water for them to feed on. A piece of 
bread placed in the middle of each plate for the flies 
to alight on will make the bait more attractive. 

Fly-Papers — Tanglefoot fly-papers should be in 
use in kitchen and dining room if flies are present. 
No fly should be allowed to live in any kitchen a 
minute longer than is absolutely necessary to pro- 
vide means for its destruction. 



Screen* — If we could eliminate all the breeding- 
places for flies we should be free from them. This 
is too much to expect at present, and the screening 
of windows and doors seems necessary. 

Flies enter a house largely through the back door 
leading to the kitchen. They are attracted to this 
opening by the odor of cooking food and by the 
warm air pouring outward when the door is opened. 
This is especially noticeable toward night on a 
wire gauze door if the main door is left open. The 
wire screen ia often literally black with flies, and 
whenever it is opened some of them are almost 
sure to enter. Moreover, this door is opened prob- 
ably more than any other in the house. The only 
efficient method of keeping flies out of the kitchen 
is to build a porch over the back door and screen 
the three open sides. Of course, a wire gauzo 
door must be placed in one side wherever it is most 
desired. With this arrangement the flies cannot 
gather on the screen door of the kitchen, and they 
do not gather on the porch screen door in auch 
vast numbers because less warm air and odor is 
present there. 



THE CLUSTER FLY 



A word should be said about the cluster, or 
bunch, or honey, fly, as it is variously called. This 
fly is slightly larger than the house fly and appears 
longer and narrower. It is familiar to most house- 
keepers because of its habit of entering houses in 
autumn and hiding away in protected nooks and 
corners in large clusters. Clustera may be seen in 
the corners of a room, beneath garments hung in 
closets, and behind curtains at darkened windows. 
The cluster fly is an annoyance because of its habit 
of specking and spoiling the wall paper. 

Normally, the cluster fly lives out of doors, fre- 
quently on the flowers and fruits of plants. In the 
autumn, however, it enters dwellings in search of 
snug retreats in which to pass the winter. It 
seems to frequent unused and darkened - rooms; 



the writer has never seen it in any abundance in 
light, much-used rooms. 

Methods of Control — Screens are of no use in 
keeping this fly out of a room. It will find cracks 
and crevices beneath the clapboards and around 
the window casings, through which it may crawl 
in spite of all that can be done. The most feasible 
plan of controlling the species is that given by one 
of our correspondents, who says: "The only way 
I have found to keep them out of the room is to 
leave out screens, lower the windows from the top, 
and have the room light." As cold weather seta in 
the clusters of flies may be swept up and burned. 

Fresh pyrethrum or insect powder, dusted freely 
on the clusters of flics, will paralyze and kill them 
so that they may be swept up and burned. 



THE MOSQUITO 



The mosquito is really a kind of small fly, not 
unlike the house fly except in size and in its power 
to "bite." Mosquitoes are no more abundant to- 
day than they were 100 hundred years ago; but 
much greater interest is shown in them nowadays 
than formerly because of their relation to certain 
diseases. There are known to be over 500 differ- 
ent kinds of mosquitoes in the world; over 60 spe- 
cies occur in the United States. Not more than 
half a dozen of these are at all common about our 
houses; only 3 of them are known to carry mala- 
ria, and only I is concerned in disseminating yel- 
low fever. 



The Bite of a Mosquito The beak of a mos- 
quito is made of 6 bristle-like or lance-like organs 
enclosed in a sheath. The bristle-like organs are 
the puncturing parts of the beak, for the sheath 
does not enter the flesh when a mosquito bitea. 

When a mosquito is puncturing the skin, an irri- 
tating poison, the chemical nature of which is not 
known, is injected into the wound. This poisonous 
substance causes an itching sensation. The imme- 
diate area turns red and becomes inflamed, and in 
the case of some persons much swelling follows. 
The itching and irritation may be relieved by the 
application of dilute solutions of ammonia, a 5 per 



330 



THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Section V— CONVENIENCES 



cent solution of carbolic acid, or a I per cent lotion 
of menthol. 

Methods of Controlling Mosquitoes — The best 
way to get rid of mosquitoes is to drain or fill up 
the ponds, pools, or other bodies of water in which 
the insects breed. Old tin cans, pails, or other use- 
less receptacles that may hold water should be 
turned bottom side up or drawn away far from 
the house. Rain barrels and tanks may be covered 
with galvanied wire netting, at least 1 4 meshes to 
the inch, so as to prevent the mosquitoes from 
laying their eggs on the water. 

In many cases ponds, pools and tanks that can- 
not be drained may be sprinkled with kerosene oil 
every two weeks during the summer. The oil 
spreads over the water in a thin film and prevents 
the wrigglers from obtaining air through their 
breathing tubes; consequently they are drowned. 
Furthermore, the oil kills the eggs and prevents 
the female mosquitoes from depositing any more. 

In case of those pools and tanks that cannot be 
drained or that it is not desirable to cover with oil, 
fishes may be introduced which will destroy the 
wrigglers. For example, goldfish, sunfish, or cer- 
tain minnows serve to keep pools free from mos- 
quitoes. 

The Use of Bed Nets — But in spite of our best 
efforts there are always a few mosquitoes in certain 
regions. One good method of escape from them 
is by the careful use of bed nets. If a net is ar- 
ranged so that it does not hang in folds and is not 
too low and close to the sleeper, little air is ex- 
cluded. In order to be serviceable, a net must be 



free from rents and large enough to reach the floor 
on all sides of the bed. A bobbinet bar, closed 
on all sides, makes an ideal net. Care should be 
taken not to allow mosquitoes to enter the net 
with the sleeper, and the edge of the net must not 
catch on the bed rail or cover and remain off the 
floor during the night. If one must travel in a 
malarial region infested ^vith mosquitoes, a light 
net should always constitute a part of the travel- 
ing outfit and have its place in the bag with other 
necessities. 

Going Indoors Early at Night — It is now known 
that night air does not carry miasma or malaria; 
but it is just as important to remain in the house 
at night as it ever was, because mosquitoes are 
particularly active after dark. Therefore, in order 
to escape the bites of Anopheles mosquitoes and 
the accompanying malaria, it is important to re- 
main indoors after dark or to have the sitting 
porches closely screened. 

Repellents for Adult Mosquitoes — Various mix- 
tures, oils, and ingredients are used for repelling 
adult mosquitoes. Oil of citronella is said to be 
an efficient protection, but its efficiency will not 
long continue at most, and it is not to be relied 
on during a night of sleep. It is mainly useful 
while one is sitting on porches or in rooms where 
mosquitoes are troublesome. 

The following mixture is recommended: cedar 
oil, I ounce; oil of citronella, 2 ounces; spirits of 
camphor, 2 ounces. A few drops of this mixture 
on a cloth hung on the bed will keep mosquitoes 
at a distance and will be effective for a long time. 



THE BEDBUG 



The body of the bedbug is flat and wide, a char- 
acter that fits it wonderfully well to the place that 
it has chosen for its home. The cracks and crevices 
of bedsteads furnish admirable protective retreats 
for an insect with a flat, thin body. Moreover, the 
bedbug has no large wings to get in its way and 
encumber its retreat. 

Dissemination of the Bedbug — It is often puz- 
zling to know how these insects become established 
in a house. One of the most prevalent ways is on 
laundry brought in by the washerwoman. The 
writer has repeatedly seen bedbugs come in on the 
weekly laundry. In several instances the insects 
were seen on the white spread of a bed where clean 
clothes had been laid by the laundress. 

If the members of a family travel considerably 
they are likely to bring the pest home in their 
trunks and handbags. Guests who have been 
traveling and stopping at various hotels often un- 
wittingly become the source of infestation by bring- 
ing the pest in their baggage. In towns and cities, 
where houses are built close together, bedbugs 
will actually migrate from one house to another. 



Control of the Bedbug — In the first place, iron 
or brass bedsteads are much more desirable than 
wooden beds in a fight against this pest. The 
former offer few cracks and crevices, and these 
are easily reached. 

The old-fashioned remedies, such as kerosene 
oil, gasoline, or benzine, when forced into cracks 
and crevices with a hand syringe or a feather, are 
still among the most efficient weapons against the 
bedbug. The treatment must be thorough and 
should be made several times in succession, v^ith 
intervals of 3 or 4 days between applications in 
order to give time for any untouched eggs to 
hatch. 

A mixture of 1 ounce corrosive sublimate, I pint 
alcohol, and }/4 pint spirits of turpentine, painted 
in the cracks of a bedstead with a feather, is an- 
other old-fashioned and effective remedy. 

Boiling water, poured over the parts of a bed- 
stead after they have been placed where they may 
be liberally treated, will kill both eggs and bugs. 
Of course, boiling water should not be used on 
highly polished or on varnished furniture. 



CONVENIENCES— MICE, INSECTS, VERMIN 



331 



Sulfur has been used with success by some per- 
sons. Not less than 2 pounds of sulfur to every 
1,000 cubic feet of space should be burned, and 
the rooms should be tightly closed for several 
hours. In order to close the cracks around win- 
dows and doors, strips of newspaper may be soaked 
in water and applied rapidly over the cracks. They 
will stick tightly for many hours. The sulfur 



should be placed in a kettle set on bricks in a tub 
of water so as to avoid danger from fire. A half 
teacupful of wood alcohol poured on the sulfur and 
then lighted will serve to burn the sulfur com- 
pletely. 

It must be remembered that sulfur fumes bleach 
certain colors in wall papers and fabrics, and tar- 
nish metals of various sorts. 



COCKROACHES 



Cockroaches are exceedingly annoying because 
of their proneness to get into substances and be- 
cause of their filthy, disgusting habits. Often they 
become so numerous that they destroy considerable 
material. They are likely to attack the bindings 
of books and other leather articles. In the larder 
they will attack almost any foodstuff, polluting 
more than they actually destroy. 

Method* of Control — In fighting cockroaches, 
persistence should be the ^vatchword. The insects 
are shy, apparently cautious regarding baits and 
poisons, and difficult to reach in any manner. 

Various kinds of traps have been devised for 
catching roaches. The box with cone-shaped 
tubes affords a sample of a modern trap. 
The box is baited at night with cheese or 
other favorite food. The roaches can enter but 
cannot escape. 

A rather unique method of killing roaches is 
described by Mr. Tepper of Australia. Plaster of 
paris, t part, is mixed in a saucer with flour, 3 or 
4 parts, and placed where the insects are abund- 
ant. Near at hand is placed a flat dish containing 
water, with bridges so arranged that the roaches 
can easily reach it. They eat of the flour and the 
plaster of paris, and either are killed or leave the 
premises. 



A powder known as insectoline, manufactured 
by the Insectoline Company, Chicago, Illinois, has 
given good results in fighting these insects. The 
writer has used it in kitchen and pantries with sat- 
isfactory results. In order to obtain the best re- 
sults with this powder, it must be applied in large 
quantities and persistently. 

Professor F. L. Washburn, after failure with sev- 
eral so-called remedies for cockroaches, tried pow- 
dered borax, and has this to say concerning its 
value as an exterminator of roaches: "We then 
turned to powdered borax, using it freely in the 
kitchen with marked success. This was sprinkled 
in cracks about the sink, along the tops of base- 
boards, near the sink, and elsewhere, wherever 
there were cracks that afforded the insects a hiding 
place. By a generous use of this substance, per- 
sisted in for two weeks, the room, in fact, we may 
say the premises, were entirely freed from this dis- 
gusting pest." 

Whatever powder or substance is used, it must 
be applied in large quantities and at short inter- 
vals for an extended period of time. Persistence 
and thoroughness are absolutely essential to the 
control of cockroaches. 

Hydrocyanic acid gas is successfully employed 
against cockroaches. 



ANTS 



Methods of Control — Perhaps the first method of 
prevention is to remove the substance attracting 
the ants. If this cannot be done, the food may be 
placed on a support, the legs of which rest in water 
covered with a film of oil. 

Another temporary expedient, and one that may 
discourage the ants enough to finally stop them 
from coming, is to soak small sponges in sweetened 
water and place them where the insects are most 
numerous. The ants will crawl into the pores of 
the sponges in great numbers and may be killed 
by dropping the sponges into boiling water. This 
process should be repeated over and over, and 
thousands of the workers may thus be destroyed. 
In instances in which this practice has been given 
a thorough and persistent trial, the ants have be- 
come so discouraged and bewildered by the sudden 
loss of so many workers that they have finally aban- 
doned the house entirely. 



A syrup made by dissolving sugar and borax 
in boiling water, placed about the infested room 
in small dishes, will attract and kill many of the 
ants. It is said also that camphor, either free or 
wrapped loosely in paper and placed around the 
foods attracting the ants, will drive them away. 

If carefully watched, the ants may often be 
traced and the crack or opening through which 
they enter may be discovered. When found, kero- 
sene oil should be squirted into it or it should be 
tightly plugged with cotton soaked in kerosene. 
This practice is often an effectual preventive. 

Ordinary ants may be prevented from reaching 
tables by setting the legs of the tables in cups con- 
taining a little water with kerosene oil on the sur- 
face. This method avails little with the Argentine 
ants, however, since they soon manage to cross 
the oil on a causeway formed from the dead bodies 
of their sacrificed comrades. Against the red ant 



332 



THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK — Section V — Conveniences 



and the little black ant, the film of oil is an effective 
barrier until the oil evaporates, when it must be 
renewed. 

Cyanid of potassium has been used with marked 
effect against ants in the field. It is a deadly 
poison, and should be handled with great care. 
If it is powdered fine and scattered over an ant hill 
after the latter has been broken up or stirred on 
the surface, the ants will begin immediately to re- 
move the pieces. In doing so, every ant that 
touches the cyanid will be killed. Colonies have 
been almost exterminated in this way, and when- 
ever the colonies of the red ant can be located the 
cyanid may be used to advantage. It will be found 
more useful against the normally outdoor species, 
such as the pavement ant and the carpenter ant, 
than against the red ant. 

It must be remembered that if fowls are allowed 
access to the poison and pick up the pieces they 
certainly will be poisoned. In order to obviate 
this difficulty, it is best to use the cyanid in solution 
by dissolving it in water at the rate of an ounce to 
a gallon of water. It may then be sprayed over the 
nest or poured down the openings. This method 
seems to be quite as effective as scattering the 
poison in the pulverized form; at least, experiments 
have shown that some species of ants may be near- 
ly, if not quite, exterminated in this way. Another 
very effective method of application consists in 
placing a pint or more of the solution in hollows 
dug out at the exits of the burrows of the colony. 

Ordinary cotton tape, treated with corrosive 
sublimate, acts as an effectual barrier to the red 
ant and other species. The tape is often wound 
about the legs of tables, or it may be tacked along 
the edges of shelves and in other places to protect 
food. The ants will not cross these strips of tape. 
The prepared tape may be bought in the larger 
cities of the South, but the author has never seen 
it for sale in cities in the North. Since one often 
receives an inferior article from the store it is bet- 
ter to prepare the tape at home. 

Mr. Newell makes a solution of the corrosive 
sublimate by heating it in water in a granite-ware 
vessel and dissolving all that the water will take 
up. After this solution has cooled it is filtered. 
The solution may be filtered, in the absence of 
filter paper, through a fine quality of cotton bat- 
ting. A thick layer of the cotton should be placed 
in a funnel, and the solution should be poured in 
and allowed to filter through. The tape is then 
soaked in this filtered solution and pinned on the 
wall to dry. Neither the solution nor the tape 
should be allowed to come in contact with iron, 
tin, or steel. When the tape is well made it will 
remain effective for many months, even for a year. 

Tartar emetic, mixed with 4 or 5 times its vol- 
ume of syrup and placed about in shallow dishes, is 



an effective remedy against house ants. If some 
of this mixture, poured into individual butter plates, 
is set about in a refrigerator where ants are trouble- 
some, or in a pantry that ants frequent, the little 
pests will soon leave. In some cases it has proved 
to be one of the simplest and most effectual rem- 
edies that can be used to rid a house of these per- 
sistent pests. 

The only method of getting rid of ants perma- 
nently is by locating their nests and treating them 
in such a way that the queen will finally be de- 
stroyed. No more eggs will be laid, and the pro- 
duction of workers will cease. One of the best 
substances for treating nests, in order to kill the 
queen and exterminate the workers, is carbon bisul- 
fid. It is often difficult to locate the nest, and some- 
times when found it will be in an inaccessible situ- 
ation; for example, it may be discovered in the 
foundation walls, under the floor, or in some other 
equally secluded and protected place. One writer 
suggests that black ants may be traced to their 
nests by baiting them writh broken pieces of rice, 
farina, or cream of wheat. The ants will carry 
these pieces of white food to their nests and may be 
easily traced in this manner. Perhaps the red ant 
may be followed to its home by the same means. 
When the colony is located it may be treated with 
carbon bisulfid by pouring an ounce or two of the 
liquid into each of several holes made in the nest 
with a sharpened stick, after which operation the 
mouth of each hole should be quickly stopped with 
a clod of dirt. A heavy wet blanket thrown over 
the nest will aid in retaining the gas and will tend 
to make the fumigation more effective. The liquid 
evaporates quickly and the gas permeates the whole 
nest, killing the queen and the workers and exter- 
minating the colony. By attaching a torch to the 
end of a long pole and extending it out over the 
nest while the operator stands at a safe distance, 
the gas may be exploded and the fumes driven into 
all corners of the colony. If the colony is located 
in the foundation walls, the problem will be much 
more difficult and may be impossible of solution. 
The difficulty will be in reaching the nest with the 
liquid. If the nest is located under the floor, it may 
be necessary to remove a piece of the flooring in 
order to gain access to the colony. 

In the use of carbon bisulfid, it must be remem- 
bered that the gas is inflammable and explosive, 
and no form of fire or light should be brought near 
the place that is being fumigated. 

L. J. Nickels has been very successful in poison- 
ing Argentine ants with a weak solution of sodium 
arsenite. For a weak solution, he dissolved a little 
more than I ounce of the arsenite in a small quan- 
tity of hot water. When dissolved the sodium ar- 
senite was added to a sweetened solution of 20

pounds of sugar dissolved in 3 quarts of water. It 
was necessary to heat the syrup mixture so as to 
thoroughly dissolve the sugar. 

In order to make a small amount of the mixture, 
3 grama of the arsenite should be dissolved in a 
small quantity of water and added to a sweetened 
syrup of 2 pounds of sugar dissolved in ^ of a pint 
of water. Small sponges may be soaked in this 

CLOTHES 

Methods of Control — First of all, it should be 
definitely understood that odors emanating from 
small quantities of various substances, such as cam- 
phor balls, cedar, and naphthalene, have no killing 
effect either on moths or on larvae. Cedar chests 
or closets lined with cedar are of no avail if eggs 
are once deposited on clothes stored in them. Ap- 
parently, the odor of cedar has some repelling 
effect on the moths themselves. The odor of cam- 
phor balls also has a repellent effect on the moths; 
but a few moth balls placed among clothes in a 
chest do not prevent injury if eggs are deposited 
on the garments before the latter are put away. 
The real function and value, then, of cedar chests 
or closets lies in repelling moths and keeping them 
away from the garments. The clothing, however, 
must be free from all eggs and larvae of the moths 
before being put in chests. Great care must be 
taken to shake and brush the garments and to 
have them in the sun and air until all the \arvx 
and eggs have been shaken loose and destroyed. 

In the second place, it should be understood that 
garments which are often worn are not liable to 
injury. It is the clothing and the materials that are 
stored away in closets and trunks for a long time 
undisturbed, which are badly injured. It is under 
such conditions that the moths have an oppor- 
tunity to deposit their eggs, that the eggs have 
a chance to lie undisturbed long enough to hatch, 
and that the larvae have occasion to eat and to 
grow to maturity. 

Sunlight and air are among our best available 
agents of protection from clothes moths. Before 
garments are put away for the summer they should 
be hung in the air and sun, and then be thoroughly 
brushed and shaken so as to dislodge the eggs and 
larvae that may be on them. In addition, they 
should be taken out occasionally, perhaps once a 
month, and brushed, shaken, and aired. The same 
treatment should be accorded woolen bedding and 
blankets that are to be stored. After the clothes 



poisoned solution and placed in jars so that the 
ants can easily gain access to them. It seems that 
the ants will carry this slightly poisoned syrup to 
their nests and feed it to the queen and to the 
broods of young ants, gradually killing off the 
whole colony. It would seem as though the same 
mixture could be used effectively for common ants. 

MOTHS 

arc once thoroughly cleaned, sunned and aired 
they may be packed away with a supply of cam- 
phor balls distributed among them to repel the 
moths. It is advisable to spray the cracks in clos- 
ets and chests with benzine or gasoline before put- 
ting the clothes in them, in order to kill any eggs 
or larvae of the moths that may be lurking there. 

A few old woolen rags or pieces of old furs, 
stored in attics but never used, are prolific breed- 
ing-places for these moths and should be taken 
out and burned. 

Doctor Howard early suggested a method of 
storing winter wraps and garments during the sum- 
mer, which is practical and efficient. He goes to 
the tailor shop and buys a few common pasteboard 
suit-boxes, and in these the garments to be stored 
are neatly folded away. Then the cracks around 
the edge? of the cover are sealed by pasting strips 
of paper over them. This makes a tight box that 
excludes all moths. With care the boxes last sev- 
eral years. 

Another method of storing clothes is given by a 
resident of the city of Washington, D. C. He has 
a wooden chest for holidng his clothes. In the 
cover of the chest he has bored a large hole and 
on the underside of the cover, directly beneath the 
hole, he has tied a large sponge. In the middle of 
the summer he pours a little carbon bisulfid on the 
sponge and closes the hole with a cork. 

Cold-storage plants are common nowadays in all 
cities and in many small towns. During the sum- 
mer these plants are available for the storage of 
furs, rugs, and other valuable woolen goods. 

Doctor Howard reports some experiments which 
demonstrate that a continuous temperature of 40 
degrees is sufficient to maintain the larvae of clothes 
moths in an inactive condition and thus prevent 
injury by them. In the light of these experiments, 
cold storage forms the simplest and safest method 
of protecting woolen goods from the ravages of 
clothes moths. 



FLEAS 



Methods of Control — It follows from what has 
been said regarding the kinds of fleas found in 
houses, and their rate of increase, that pet dogs 
and cats must be eliminated or must be kept clean 
and free from these pests. These animals may be 
kept reasonably free from fleas by frequently bath- 
ing them in a solution of creolin. A dog can be 



bathed with a 3 per cent solution. 4 teaspoonfuls 
to I quart of water, or 4 tablespoonfuls to I gal- 
lon of water. Cats are more sensitive, and should 
be bathed with a 2 per cent solution. 

A dog or a cat should be provided with a sleep- 
ing-cloth or rug, which should be beaten or shaken 
at least once a week and hung in the sunlight, if 



334 



THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Section V— CONVENIENCES 



possible, for a few hours. If infested, the kennel 
should be thoroughly washed inside and outside 
with a 3 per cent solution of creolin. 

To clear a house of fleas when it is once in- 
fested is often a strenuous task. In the first place, 
a change from carpets to rugs, if possible, is recom- 
mended. The larvae of fleas cannot develop in 
rooms in which the floors are exposed and swept 
from time to time. In severe infestations, nothing 
but the removal of all floor coverings, followed by 
a thorough washing of the floors with strong soap- 
suds, will avail. In case of old floors, the cracks 
should be filled with some good filler. 

The use of benzine or gasoline will also be very 
helpful. The carpets should be sprinkled with the 
gasoline. Special attention should be paid to the 
edges of the carpets and to the cracks underneath 
the baseboards. Great care should be exercised 
regarding fire while gasoline is being applied, ow- 
ing to its inflammable character. 

CARPET 

Methods of Control — The carpet beetles will al- 
ways be difficult to control in houses having floors 
completely covered with carpets that are tightly 
tacked about the edges. A carpet placed perma- 
nently on the floor and allowed to remain there 
undisturbed for a year furnishes ideal conditions 
for these pests to thrive and increase. As was 
urged in the case of fleas, so again it is urged that 
a change from carpets to rugs be made if pos- 
sible. Where bare floors, partially covered with 
rugs, are maintained, the carpet beetles will not 
find hiding places suited to their development. 
Moreover, the rugs can be examined without diffi- 
culty at any time, and they are usually dusted and 
aired too often for the larvae to gain a foothold. 
The tendency among modern homes is to use rugs 
on polished floors, with a consequent diminution 
of the carpet beetles as a household pest. 

Where the insects have become well established 
in a house nothing but heroic measures and long- 
continued efforts will avail. House-cleaning should 
certainly occur tw^ice a year instead of once, and 
should be very thoroughly done, at least so far as 
the carpets are concerned. They should be re- 
moved, thoroughly dusted and beaten, sprayed 
with gasoline, and hung in the air and sunlight 
as long as possible. 

The floors should be thoroughly washed and 
scrubbed with soap and w^ater, especially along the 
baseboards and the cracks of the floors. It would 
be of advantage to spray the cracks beneath the 
baseboards with benzine or gasoline, to clean out 
all the dirt possible from the cracks in the floor, 
and to pour in benzine or kerosene oil. Before 
the carpet is replaced on old floors the cracks 
should be filled w^ith a crack-filler, and thus the 
favorite hiding-places for the larvae might be elim- 
inated. In badly infested houses, tarred building 



Miss Fields, long a resident of Southern China, 
says she renders her house immune from fleas by 
dissolving alum in the whitewash or the calcimine 
when it is applied to the walls. She also places 
sheets of thick paper, dipped in a solution of alum, 
under the matting and scatters pulverized alum in 
all crevices where the insects might breed. Po%v- 
dered alum, she states, may be scattered on the 
carpet and swept into its meshes w^ithout injury. 
Dr. Henry Skinner has had good results with the 
use of flake naphthalene. He said that he "took 
one room at a time, scattered on the floor 3 pounds 
of flake naphthalene and closed it for 24 hours. 
On entering such a room the naphthalene vapor 
will instantly bring tears to the eyes and cause 
coughing and irritation of the air passages. . . . 
It proved to be a perfect remedy and very inex- 
pensive as the naphthalene could be swept up and 
transferred to other rooms." 

BEETLES 

paper may be placed beneath the carpets, but the 
odor from such paper is not always pleasant. 

The carpet may be loosely tacked about the 
edges, thus affording the owner an opportunity to 
examine it so as to see whether the pests have re- 
turned. The follow^ing is a good account of the 
manner in which one housekeeper finally got rid 
of the pests: "My own experience w^ith them be- 
gan last year. We moved to our present abode in 
April, and it was not until every carpet had been 
put down and the house settled that I was aware 
that we had such unwelcome guests. I was not 
long in observing their habit of running into any 
crack and crevice that presented itself, and also run- 
ning along the joints of the floors, and our w^arfare 
against them w^as directed toward these joints. In 
the closets we stopped up every nook on the walls; 
every crevice under the baseboards, and filled up 
the joints of the floors; then w^e laid down oilcloth, 
and kept a plentiful supply of camphor in the 
closets. I am happy to say that we have had no 
trouble with them since so doing. 

"Fortunately, we had put paper under all the 
carpets, so w^e felt that they were in a measure, at 
least, protected, but 1 found them continually, just 
under the edges of the carpet. As far as possible 
we filled up the crevices under the baseboards and 
I used benzine plentifully all the summer, saturat- 
ing the borders of the carpets every tw^o weeks 
and killing all I saw in the meantime. Last spring 
w^e varnished the cracks of the floors, and in some 
cases, w^here they were open, covered them with 
strips of thin muslin stuck down with the varnish; 
we again put paper under the carpets, as we had 
found it such protection the previous year. I have 
found the various insect powders of no use what- 
ever when the insect is in the larval state; whether

or not is has any effect on the beetle I cannot say; 

but this 1 can state that our unceasing warfare 

has not been in vain, for 1 have, during the past 
summer, seen only single ones where last year I 
found scores.** 

Hydrocyanic Acid Gas — This gas is quite as 
effectual for the carpet beetle as it is for the bed- 
bug (see Bedbugs). 

Sulfur — ^The fumes of sulfur are quite as effec- 
tive as hydrocyanic acid gas if enough of the sul- 
fur is burned at one time. Not less than 2 pounds 
of sulfur to 1,000 cubic feet of space should be 
used. The room should be tightly calked and 
closed as described in the chapter on bedbugs. 
We would again call attention to the injury that 
may result from sulful fumes to metala, wall 
papers, and similar furnishings. 

Corrosive Sublimate and Alcohol — As we have 
pointed out. the larvee congregate mostly about the 
edges of the carpets. It is said that a solution of 
60 grains of corrosive sublimate, dissolved in I pint 
of alcohol, and applied to the edges and under- 



sides of the carpet around the borders, will poison 
the larvae when they begin to eat the fabric. The 
alcohol quickly evaporates and leaves the corro- 
sive sublimate among the fibers of the carpet, where 
it will remain for a long time. Since corrosive 
sublimate is such a virulent poison, great care 
must be exercised when children are likely to play 
about the room, lest they get hold of some of the 
material and become poisoned. 

Trapping the Larvse — The larvae may be trapped 
by placing woolen cloths, especially red ones, in 
closets. Among these the larva will congregate 
and may be caught and killed by shaking the 
cloths once a week over a piece of paper. If per- 
sistent effort is made, many of them may be killed. 

Protection of Furs and Woolens — These may be 
stored in boxes in exactly the same manner as is 
described in the chapter on clothes moths. The 
box arranged for the application of carbon bisulfid 
serves as vrell in protecting materials from the car- 
pet beetle as from the clothes moths. 



LARDER BEETLES 



Methods of Control — In the first place, the 
beetles are easily seen and may be caught by hand 
and killed. This may be the most satisfactory way 
of dealing with them if they are not too abundant. 

Cheese is very attractive to the beetles; if pieces 
are exposed here and there the beetles will con- 
gregate and may be caught and killed in consid- 
erable numbers. Cheese ground up and poisoned 
with arsenic, and then placed in the haunts of the 
beetles, will often kill many of them. 

When hams and shoulders are put away they 
should be bagged as early as possible after being 
cured and should be wrapped with great care. If 



the least crack or opening is left the larvae will 
find entrance. 

If a ham or similar food should become infested 
with the grubs, the part containing them should be 
cut away and burned; the remaining part of the 
meat should be treated with a dilute solution of 
carbolic acid. 

If the beetles become abundant, and there are 
many hiding-places, the room in which they are 
present should be entirely cleared of food products 
and anything else that may interfere with the work 
of cleaning. The storeroom should then be thor- 
oughly cleaned and finally sprayed with benzine 
or fumigated w^ith carbon bisulfid. 



FISH MOTHS 



Methods of Control — Usually books stored in 
moist basements or other damp roon\s are the 
most seriously injured. This, of course, suggests 
airy, dry rooms for the storage of books or valu- 
able papers if one wishes to preserve them free 
from injury by the fish moth. 

Another common method of preventing injury 
to books and papers is by the frequent use of bu- 
hach powder. Fresh buhach should be sprinkled 
freely on the shelves and on the books themselves. 
Moreover, this treatment should be given frequently 
where these pests are abundant and persistent, 
because the powder so soon loses its strength. 
In badly infested houses, starched clothes, stiffened 



silk, and similar fabrics should not be allowed to 
remain too long packed away in drawers or loose 
in chests or boxes. 

It is customary for librarians to poison sweet- 
ened paste with white arsenic, spread the mixture 
on pieces of cardboard, and slip the latter about 
on shelves among the infested books as bait for 
the fish moths. It would seem that a like method 
of procedure, in which glue is substituted for the 
starch matter, might also succeed in killing the 
pests. These pieces of cardboard might be placed 
about among garments or other stored fabrics if 
injury by the fish moth is anticipated.

MISCELLANIES 



To Dispose of Mice The "harmless, necessary 

cat" is usually the best mice exterminator. Mice 
will not stay long in a home where there is a cat. 
But in many places a cat is not wanted; in city 
apartments they are a great deal of trouble, and 
it must be admitted that in the country they are as 
capable exterminators of the desirable songbird as 
of the undesirable mice. Cayenne pepper, in bags 
at mice holes, or sprinkled down them, or rags 
dipped in water and then in the pepper and stuffed 
in the holes, will drive mice elsewhere. Or scatter 
camphor about where they run and in their holes; 
they very much dislike it, and will leave where its 
odor is apparent to them at all. 

Red Ants are ^Iso driven away by the odor of 
camphor gum. Camphor may be placed quite near 
food which the ants are after, as it does not "ab- 
sorb" into or affect the food at all. 

When ants are running, dip a sponge or some 
fluffy cotton in sweetened water and place it in 
their path; they will immediately infest it, then drop 
it in hot water, clean and repeat. Then sprinkle 
the camphor to drive away the late comers. 

For Roaches, as well as ants, borax is efficacious. 
Do not moisten it, but mix it powdered with gum 
camphor, or even sprinkle the borax alone, thickly, 
over the closet shelves and into the cracks which 
seem to be infested. It may take several applica- 
tions, as roaches are persistent; but in the end will 
effectually banish them. 

Moths or Mice will not invade paper boxes, or 
boxes covered with paper, or scrap books, etc., or 
books packed in boxes, if alum is used in the paste 
with which the paper covering the boxes, etc., is 
pasted on. 

To Prevent Moths before putting away shades or 
rugs, sprinkle with cayenne pepper. Use it any- 
where else, in place of "moth balls" (camphor) 
where the pepper itself would later not be objec- 
tionable as in the case of clothes. 

Water Bugs — A weak solution of turpentine 
poured down the water pipes once a week will 
drive awray water bugs. 

Flies may be kept away from such things as gilt 
frames by going over these with a soft brush dipped 
in a pint of water in which three or four onions 
have been boiled. 

To Wash Linoleum — Varnish new linoleum with 
a good quality of varnish before it is used. This 
really doubles its life. Never use soap in scrubbing 
linoleum, but put a cup of kerosene into the pail 
of water, wash thoroughly and dry off with a soft 
cloth. If it is varnished a rub over with one of 
the oiled mops will keep it in perfect condition. 



New linoleums should have two coats of varnish 
and will be all the better for three. 

Oiled and Varnished Wood should be simply 
wiped with a flannel cloth wrung out of warm 
water. Grained wood should be washed with cold 
tea. Painted wood may be washed in warm water 
with a few drops of ammonia used. 

Smoked Ceilings that have been blackened by 
lamp or gas soot, may be washed off with soda 
water. 

Broken Walls may be filled in with a mixture of 
white and plaster of paris made into a paste with 
water, or with vinegar if it hardens too fast for 
use. Cover over with paper to match that on wall. 

Dustless Dusters — After washing, ordinary dus- 
ters dipped in kerosene and dried in the open air, 
make excellent home-made "dustless" dusters. Dry 
mops may be similarly treated with good effect. 

A Wood-Box Problem (or Coal Box) — The box 
is usually full when you want to sweep. Put 
casters on it, so you can move it around easily. 

To Keep Sponges soft and clean, wash them in 
warm water containing a little tartaric acid, then 
rinse in plenty of cold water. Do not put in too 
much of the acid, or have the ^vater very hot, or 
you may spoil the sponge: be sure to wash the 
acid out thoroughly. 

Hot Water Bottles, Bags, Pans, Jugs, should be 
hung or turned upside down when not in use, to 
thoroughly drain. With rubber bags, however, as 
soon as well drained, but before entirely dried out 
inside, put in the stopper, so as to retain a little of 
the moist air (but no water) as this moist air will 
make the rubber last longer and remain soft and 
flexible better than too dry air such as would other- 
wise replace the moist air if left hanging open in a 
warm dry room. 

Saving Soap — Quantities of soap are thrown 
away. When a cake has dwindled to a thin piece 
it is usually discarded, or breaks up and is wasted. 
T\vo or three such pieces may be moistened and 
allowed to stand until soft, then stuck together and 
pressed into a respectable cake; or the thin pieces 
may be kept in a can or bowl until a sufficient 
number are collected, then covered with about 
four times as much water as there is soap and 
boiled until the soap is dissolved. This makes a 
soft soap that is invaluable where suds are wanted. 
A teaspoonful of the soft soap will serve for a dish- 
pan of water and will be found more convenient 
than cake soap. 

To Stop a Leak — A temporary stopping of a leak 
in a water or gas pipe is easily effected with a paste 



CONVENIENCES— MICE, INSECTS, VERMIN 



337 



made of yellow soap and whiting. This, of course, 
should not prevent one's sending immediately for 
the plumber, but it %vill make waiting for him less 
trying. 

White Enamel — To keep white enamel sink and 
bath tub clean and beautifully white give them a 
good rubbing with a cloth wet with kerosene, then 
rinse with hot soap suds. Dirt will instantly disap- 
pear from sinks, bath tubs and wash bowls, if a 
woollen cloth dampened in gasoline is used. 



Water Bugs — A weak solution of turpentine 
poured down the water pipes once a week will 
drive away water bugs. 

When Leaving Home for any length of time pour 
about half a cupful of kerosene in the wash bowl, 
closet, laundry tubs, sink, etc. This will prevent 
sewer gas or water bugs from coming into the 
house, and the odor will disappear in a few hours.

A GOOD HOME-MADE LAUNDRY LIST 

Take an ordinary scratch pad and paste the back of it on the 
right hand side of a cardboard, the latter cut with an inch margin 
above the pad and a two-inch margin to left of pad. 

Write on a two-inch slip of paper, preferably typewrite, 
alphabetically, the names of all laundry articles. To avoid oversight 
of important articles follow^ a printed laundry list — or you can cut up 
and use the printed list itself. Paste this on the two-inch margin to 
left of pad. Obviously the pad must be as long as the list when 
written out — and do not have the articles on the list too close together. 

Each week write on pad the number of out-going articles, 
opposite the names on the list. Check them off when returned and 
tear the sheet off pad, leaving fresh sheet for the next week. 

WATER 

The following nnatter is taken from Cornell Reading Course, Bulletin Farm House 
Series No. 3, "The Laundry." 

A bountiful supply of good water for laundry purposes is an important factor in 
successful laundering. Water is the natural solvent for much of the dirt that accumulates on 
clothing; moreover, it acts as a carrier to rid the clothing of all forms of dirt, both soluble 
and insoluble. Unfortunately, good drinking water is not necessarily equally good for laun- 
dry purposes, as water may hold in solution substances not hurtful to health but very detri- 
mental to cleaning purposes. A water good for the laundry should be clean, soft, clear, odor- 
free from discoloration, free from iron, free from organic matter. 

HARD AND SOFT WATER 



The characteristic known aa hardness, possessed 
by some waters, is due to the presence of lime 
salts. Hard water is not the best for laundry pur- 
poses, as lime salts decompose the soap used and 
form in its place an insoluble lime soap, which 
collects as a curd on the surface of the water. 
Such soap decomposition takes place aa long as 
any lime remains in the water and the cleaning 



(detergent) properties of soap are not in opera- 
tion until every bit of lime has combined with soap 
to form lime soap. By leaving minute particles of 
lime soap in its pores, hard water is said to weaken 
a fabric. If the available supply of water is hard, 
then, the problem of the housekeeper is to find 
some means of removing ilme or of reducing its 
ill effects.

MATERIALS FOR SOFTENING WATER 



Washing Soda (sodium carbonate) — Washing 
soda is the best alkali to soften water for general 
household use, for while effective in its action, it 
is not so corrosive as to render its handling diffi- 
cult or its use unduly harmful, nor is it expensive. 
It should never be used in its dry form, however, 
for it is an alkali sufficiently strong to eat holes in 
a fabric if it is used in full strength, and wherever 
a particle of the dry substance falls a strong solu- 
tion is formed. Carelessness causes many of the 
complaints against present-day laundry methods. 

Lye (sodium hydroxid or caustic soda) — Lye is 
an alkali of far greater strength than washing soda; 
one pound of lye being equal to about twelve 
pounds of washing soda, it should be used with 
just so much the greater caution. It should never 
be used save in solution, and as the solution de- 
teriorates very rapidly on exposure to air, if any 
quantity is made it should be kept in bottles or jars 
tightly stoppered with rubber stoppers. The com- 
pound formed by exposing lye to the action of air 
and virater, is washing soda, so there is no advant- 
age in using it after all. Lye is much more diffi- 
cult to handle, and its action is so much more 
corrosive than is that of other alkalis that it is not 
advisable to use it in the home laundry. 

Borax (sodium biborate) — One of the mildest 
alkalis to use in the laundry is borax. This alkali 
is more expensive than either lye or washing soda 
and is not so vigorous in its action: but in some in- 
stances it is greatly to be preferred to either lye or 
washing soda. Washing soda and lye, unless they 
are thoroughly rinsed from clothing, have a ten- 



dency to cause yellowing, particularly when starch 
is used afterwards. Borax, on the other hand, has 
a tendency to whiten fabrics and is added directly 
to starch, in order to give it good color and to 
increase its clearness. When colored fabrics or 
wools are to be washed in hard water, borax is one 
of the best alkalis to use for softening the water; 
therefore it should be on the laundry shelf for that 
purpose if for no other. 

Ammonia (ammonium hydroxid) — Ammonia is 
another good alkali for softening water when it is 
not advisable to use stronger alkalis. Ammonia is 
a very volatile substance, consequently it should 
be used only when the laundry process is to be 
conducted quickly. It is better and cheaper to 
purchase the full-strength ammonia from a drug- 
gist and then dilute it, than to buy the article 
known as household ammonia, which is of un- 
known strength. 

To Soften Water Water may be softened by 

any of the following methods: 

1 . For each gallon of water, use two table- 
spoons of a solution made by dissolving one pound 
of washing soda in one quart of boiling water. 
The solution should be bottled and kept on hand, 
as it is a useful cleansing agent (detergent). 

2. For each gallon of water use one-fourth 
tablespoon of lye dissolved in one cup of water. 

3. For each gallon of water use one tabelspoon 
of borax dissolved in one cup of water. 

If water is very hard, increase the amount of 
alkali used. 



ORGANIC MATTER 



Organic material may be precipitated by the use 
of alum in the form of an alum-borax mixture. 
The sediment should be allowed to settle and the 
water may then be drawn from the top. 

To Remove Organic Matter — For each gallon of 
water use one tablespoon of a mixture made up of 



two-thirds borax and one-third alum. If the water 
is rich in organic matter, use more than one table- 
spoon of the mixture. When water is very scarce, 
alum is sometimes used to separate the dirt from 
the water and the water is then filtered and used 
again. 



THE WORK ON WASH-DAY 

Before taking up short-cuts in washing, let us see if we can lessen the actual 
bulk of wash-day. Table cloths can be saved by frequent use of bleached crash 
runners for breakfast and luncheon; also they make a desirable change in artistic 
table appearance. They are smaller and easier to wash and iron than heavy linen 
covers. 

Paper napkins and paper cloths, which come in sets, also make a desirable 
change, are cheap, and save laundry. They are especially suitable for informal 
luncheons and for summer. The bare polished table, with a few doilies, may be 
frequently used. 

Use lightweight knit union underwear instead of muslin. Use crepe for 
nightgowns, petticoats, house dresses, and children's dresses and boys' waists; 
they w^ash quickly, require no starch and need not be ironed. Small children may 
use rompers and save petticoats. 

PREPARING FOR THE WASH 

Sort your washing for different tubs. Put table linen and other comparatively clean 
articles into one, the next cleanest into another, etc. Soak handkerchiefs in a basin of salt 
water, pour soapy water over them and put them into one of the "clean goods" tubs. If 
colds have prevailed in the family, the handkerchiefs should be put to soak in a solution of 
boric acid by themselves, and should be separately washed and boiled for twenty minutes. 

Soak the clothes overnight in cold water. In the morning fill washing machine with 
scalding water, cut in the soap and put in the first tub of clothes. Run the tub 15 minutes; 
the second while you are rinsing and bluing the clothes from the first. If you use the scalding 
process it is not necessary to boil the clothes oftener than once monthly. Washing with naph- 
tha soap will obviate boiling even that often. The naphtha soap should be shaved into a 
tub of lukewarm water at noon the day before. Put in the first tub of clothes to soak, and at 
night time run the washer with these, wring them and put in rinsing water; put the rest of 
the white clothes into soak until morning. 

In the morning take out part of the clothes and run in washer; let the colored clothes 
soak while you hang out the white. By this method you can get the entire washing on the 
line early in the morning; and breaking up the work over the two days does not leave you 
worn out. 

To Wash with Paraffin (Cornell Reading Course) — Apparatus: paraffin wax, laun- 
dry soap, soft water, clothes boiler, saucepan, laundry tub and wringer. 

Soak the clothes overnight in cold soft water. 

Shred Yz cupful of paraffin and Yi pound bar of soap, and melt each in 1 pint of 
hot water. 

Fill the boiler with soft water and bring to boiling point; add the parafHn mixture. 

Wring the clothes out of the water in which they are soaking, put them in the boiler, 
and boil Yz hour. 

Remove the clothes to a tub of soft, warm water, or a washing machine, and rinse 
the soapsuds well out of them. Only the very dirty parts need to be rubbed. This rinsing 
water must be kept as warm as possible. 

Rinse in clear cold water. Rinse in bluing water. 

(Note) — For a washing of about five boilerfuls, prepare twice the amount of par- 
affin and soap, putting one-half of it in the first boilerful and adding more to each succeed- 
ing boilerful of clothes.

GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR WASHING 

(From Cornell Reading Course, Farm House Series No. 3, "The Laundry") 

Directions for Washing — Have plenty of hot water before beginning the washing. 
If possible the water should be soft; if it is not, soften it (see methods for softening under 
"WATER"). 

Make a soap solution; use 1 cake of soap to 2 or 3 quarts of water. 

Rinse the clothes from water in which they were soaked, removing as much of the 
dirt as possible. Parts of the clothing that are very much soiled should be rubbed a little 
and rinsed in fresh water before the garments are put into a tub or a washing machine. The 
precaution of rinsing saves wear and tear on the whole garment. 

Pour warm water into tub or washing machine; if the water is hard, soften it with 
washing-soda solution or borax. Add enough soap solution or soap to make a good suds. 
A tablespoonful of turpentine, kerosene, or benzine may be added to the washing water as 
well as to the water in which clothing has soaked. Put in clothes to be washed. Rubbing 
is essential for soiled garments; it may be accomplished in one of two ways; by using the 
washboard and old-fashioned tub, or by using a washing machine. It is well to have a 
board for very soiled parts, such as hems and edges, but the washing machine is a great 
improvement on the older method. 

Whenever the water becomes dirty, use fresh suds. Clothes cannot be made clean 
without the use of plenty of water. Keep up a good suds while w^ashing, and add hot water 
from time to time. If a washing machine is used, do not put enough water in the machine 
to float the clothes; if you should they would escape the mechanical action of the dasher and 
would not be sufficiently rubbed. Clothes should be wrung from the wash water through the 
wringer. The screws of the wringer should be adjusted to bring its rolls close together, and 
clothing should be folded so as to give it an even thickness in passing through the wringer; 
for heavier garments loosen the screws of the wringer. Fold in buttons and hooks and 
turn the wringer slowly. 

A second suds is generally necessary, though it may be omitted if the clothing has 
been only slightly soiled. Shake out clothes wrung from the first suds, look them over for 
soiled parts, turn them wrong side out, and drop them into second suds. Wash and wring 
them ready for boiling. 

Clothes should be clean before they are boiled, as the boiling process is intended 
not so much to remove visible dirt as to destroy germs and purify the clothing as well as 
to whiten it. Boiling is omitted when a naphtha soap is used, as the soap loses its effect in 
very hot water; it is asserted that boiling is not needed because naphtha itself is a purifier. 
Nevertheless, at least once a month, the clothing washed at other times with naphtha soap 
should be boiled. 

Fill the boiler half full of cold water; if the water is hard, soften it. Add enough 
soap solution to make a light suds. Half fill the boiler with clothes, wrung and shaken out 
from the last suds. Use plenty of water and do not put too many clothes into the boiler. 
Bring the water very gradually to the boiling point and boil 1 minutes. 

Kerosene or turpentine is sometimes added to the boiling water to counteract the 
yellow color given clothing by the use of the dark resin soaps. It is better to avoid kero- 
sene and turpentine at this point if possible, as clothing treated by them require very thor- 
ough rinsing to remove the odor. Each boilerful of clothes should be started with clean cold 
water. Cloths or clothes containing lampblack or machine oil may be placed in the hot water 
left after the last clothes have been wrung from it. Kerosene or turpentine should then be 
added, as they are the solvents for such dirt. 



LAUNDRY. IRONING BOARD— GENERAL DIRECTIONS, WASHING 343 

Rinsing is an important part of the washing process, for if soap or some of the 
strong alkalis are left in the cloth they may be very detrimental in the bluing or starching 
process. 

If water is hard it should be softened for rinsing with either borax or ammonia and 
not with washing soda. The rinsing water should be hot. The clothes should be slowly 
lifted with a clean stick from the boiler into a dishpan, and drained or wrung or shaken 
before being put into the rinse water. It is not always practicable to use more than one 
rinse water before bluing the clothes, but better results are obtained when the clothes are 
rinsed more than once. With some kinds of bluing, the presence of soap or alkali precipi- 
tates the blue as iron rust. If the starch used is not pure, and any lye or washing soda or 
soap has been left in the cloth, a yellow color is produced from the starch impurities by the 
action of those alkalis. Wring from the rinsing water and shake out the garments. 

Bluing — It is impossible to give any rule for the amount of bluing to use or the depth 
of color to be decided upon. Some fabrics, such as soft, loosely-woven fabrics, absorb more 
bluing than others. The amount of bluing to be used is a matter of experimentation by the 
launderer. Clothing should not be allowed to stand in the bluing water, as they might 
become streaked. 

If a ball bluing is used tie it in a thick cloth, wet, and squeeze it into a bowlful of 
hot water. Use a part of the resulting bluing solution for bluing the water. More of the 
bluing in the bowl should be added to the bluing in the tub from time to time as the cloth- 
ing takes it up. As some kinds of bluing are in the form of minute particles, the bluing 
water should be stirred each time before adding clothes to it. After they are wrung, un- 
starched clothes will then be ready for drying. 

Starching — Make the starch according to directions. Starch those garments requir- 
ing thick starch first, as moisture from the clothing gradually thins the starch and a medium 
stiff, medium thin, and thin starch gradually result. 

Stiff Starch — Collars, cuffs, shirt-bosoms. 

Medium Stiff Starch — Shirt waists, collars and cuffs, coarse lace curtains. 

Medium Thin Starch — White petticoats, duck skirts, and some dresses. 

Thin Starch — Skirts and dresses when a stiff finish is not desired; shirt waists. 

Clear Starch — Infants' dresses, fine laces, curtains, light-weight table linen when it is 
desirable to give it some body. 

Raw Starch — Collars, cuffs, shirt-bosoms when an extra stiffness is desired; some 
light curtains. 

The starch should be thoroughly worked into the cloth so as to distribute it evenly 
through the threads of the fabric. Such working insures a smooth, even stiffness and pre- 
vents starch spots in ironing. All garments starched with boiled starch should be dried 
thoroughly before being dampened. They should be dampened several hours before being 
ironed. If articles are to be raw-starched they should be thoroughly dried first. They are 
then dipped into the raw starch and rubbed as for washing, squeezed dry, and spread out 
on a clean sheet or cloth, but not one over the other. They should cover only half the 
sheet. The other half of the sheet should be folded over them. Then the sheet with its 
contents should be rolled tightly and stand for 2 or 3 hours to insure even distribution of 
moisture. 

Drying — When possible the process of drying should accomplish more than the mere 
removal of moisture. Clothing should be hung where it will be freely exposed to the action 
of fresh air and sunshine. Such exposure purifies and bleaches at the same time. In many 
commercial laundries a chemical bleach is used to whiten clothing that is necessarily dried 
in steam closets, and consequently does not have the beneficial bleaching action of sunshine. 



344 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Section VI— LAUNDRY. IRONING BOARD 

The home launderer does not often have to consider the need for commercial bleaching 
agents. 

The launderer should be provided with a clothespin bag. or, better still, with a 
clothespin apron having a deep pocket, good and wide. 

When possible, lines should be taken down each week, but when they cannot be 
they should be well wiped with a damp cloth before hanging up clothes. The clothespins 
should be clean. Each article should be turned wrong side out and hung with the threads 
of the material straight; the garment should be shaped as nearly as possible in its natural 
shape. Avoid hanging pieces by comers, for thus hung they will be pulled out of shape. 
Fasten garments by their bands when possible. Table linen, bed linen and towels 
should be pinned in at least four places, as it is nearly impossible to iron properly a piece 
that was improperly hung. Careful hanging greatly reduces the labor of ironing. When the 
clothes are brought in from the line the clothespins should be put into the apron or basket 
kept for that purpose and placed where they will be kept clean. 

Starched pieces should not be allowed to freeze, and should be removed from the 
line as soon as dry. Long hanging reduces their stiffness. If flannel underwear is properly 
stretched and hung it may be folded and put away without further treatment. 

Dampening — Clothes should be dampened some hours before being ironed, because 
during the interval between moistening and ironing the moisture becomes distributed evenly 
and does away with the necessity of using a superfluous amount of water. The dampening 
is best done at night, but only as many articles should be sprinkled as can be ironed next 
day, for damp fabrics will mildew if left wet for a few days, especially in hot weather. Al- 
though clothes should be well dampened, they should not be drenched. Very often trouble 
in ironing starched pieces is owing to overwetting. The starched part is soaked and made 
limp and sticky. A clean whisk broom kept for the purpose is the best thing to use for 
sprinkling clothes. Some persons have used a toy sprinkling pot. There is, however, a 
danger in its use, for it may rust and give rise to rust spots on clothes. Large pieces should 
be sprinkled and folded separately. Small pieces may be sprinkled and laid together be- 
fore folding. Care should be taken to fold and roll garments smoothly, as this aids in their 
ironing. The rolls of dampened pieces should be packed closely in a basket lined with a 
clean cloth and covered with a clean cloth. 

Table linen and other linen should be made very damp, not wet. If table linen is 
sprinkled with a mixture of 1 part alcohol and 4 parts water, the result after ironing will be 
a slight stiffness resembling that of new linen. 

If an ironing machine is used, unstarched pieces may be removed from the line while 
still damp and ironed immediately without the preliminary sprinkling. 

Washing Colored Clothing — The processes of dyeing have so improved that almost 
all wash goods are now considered to have fast colors. This is particularly true of the better 
grades of fabrics, in which the dye seems to attach itself with especial firmness to the fibers 
of the cloth. Though a color may be said to be fast, it is only relatively fast. Colored goods 
require more careful treatment than do white goods. The conditions that most affect the 
stability of colors in fabrics are: long-continued action of water and soap; strong alkalis or 
acids; strong sunlight, which is a powerful bleaching agent and is used frequently for bleach- 
ing. 

In washing colored clothing, the factors just enumerated should be kept in mind. 
Colored clothing should not be soaked for any length of time unless its color is known to be 
very stable. Any soap used in the washing process should be a mild soap in solution, or if 
the color of the goods to be washed is very delicate the soap solution should be replaced 
by soap bark, bran, rice water, potato water, or cooked-starch water. The washing process 
should be conducted quickly, and in water not very hot. After washing, colored garments 



LAUNDRY. IRONING BOARD— GENERAL DIRECTIONS. WASHING 345 

should be turned inside out and hung in a very shady or dark place, and should be taken 
in as soon as dry. Fading is more often owing to careless drying than to any fault in ivash- 
ing. Washing powders and strong alkalis should never be used with colored clothing. If 
the water needs softening, use borax. If starch, bran, rice water, etc., are substituted for 
soap, use the mixture as if it were soapsuds. 

In starching colored clothes, rub the starch in thoroughly and wipe off any excess 
of it; no difficulty will then be experienced with white starch spots. 

To Set Color — Sometimes a fabric shows a decided tendency to fade even under the 
best washing conditions. It is always well if there is any doubt about fading to test a small 
piece of the cloth before washing it. If the color fades, then an attempt should be made 
to set it. With most colors the dyer uses chemical substances which cause a firmer union 
between the color and the cloth. Such substances are called mordants. The process of 
making a color fast may sometimes satisfactorily be used by the housekeeper to strengthen 
weak colors. The household mordants are brine, vinegar, sugar of lead, and alum, used in 
the following proportions: 

To I gallon of water add '/2 cupful mild vinegar, or 2 cupfuls salt, or 1 tablespoon- 
ful alum, or I tablespoonful sugar of lead (poison). 

Vinegar is best for pinks. Small pieces of cloth should be tested in each of the 
above solutions and a choice made after the test. The cloth of which the color is to be made 
fast should be left in the mordant solution over night, and may be left in for several days 
with good results. It should be thoroughly dried before being washed. Even with rela- 
tively strong colors, soaking a fabric over night in a brine solution before washing it for the 
first time may render it far less susceptible to fading influences than it otherwise would be. 
The effect of brine, however, is said not to be lasting. Colored goods are often rinsed in 
a dilute salt solution just before drying them. 

THE LAUNDERING AND CARE OF WOOLENS 

All vs^aters w^hich touch w^oolens should be of the same temperature. There 
are scientific reasons for this, not necessary to expound here. Woolens should not 
be w^ashed in both hot and cold water; nor should woolens ever be rubbed. It is 
such treatment that causes shrinkage. 

Strong alkalies, soda, lye, washing powders, should be avoided. If necessary 
to soften the water, or to cut grease or neutralize any acids used to remove stains, 
use borax or ammonia. 

Woolen Blankets are ruined if put in tub and washed like cotton goods. Shake them 
first, to remove all dust. Then look for spots and mark same with a few stitches of white 
thread (colored thread might fade and leave a mark). 

Measure the blankets and set a pair of curtain stretchers ready to take them — they 
may be stretched doubled if double blankets. 

Don't rub soap directly on them — use a soap solution, made by shaving a bar of 
good, white neutral soap in cold water, heating to boiling point, allowing to cool, then add- 
ing 2 tablespoonfuls of powdered borax and Yi cupful of wood or denatured alcohol. 

Temperature of all waters used for woolens should be about 1 1 degrees F. Work 
blankets up and down, squeeze them lightly, but don't rub. Badly soiled places stretch over 
a smooth surface and use a brush with the soap solution. Don't use a wringer, except very 
lightly adjusted, and keep the blanket flat, not stretched, pulled or crumpled. 

Drying — Don't let lie about wet. Don't wash but one blanket at a time. Unless 
you use frames, hang straight on a clean, light line; use plenty of clothespins. Don't dry 



346 THE H OME-KEEPING BOOK— Section VI— LAUNDRY. IRONING BOARD 

in direct rays of the sun; it will yellow the blanket; select a bright place in a light wind. 
During drying, use often a whisk broom with lengthwise stroke to rub up the nap. When 
perfectly dry, rub with a flannel cloth in a dry room until blanket is light and fluffy. 

Colored Woolens will come out drab or streaked unless you set the colors. For 
red, light blue, tan and brown, soak about 1 minutes in a solution of 1 ounce sugar of lead 
to 1 gallon of water. For purple, green, mauve or blue (predominating) soak in alum w^ater, 
1 ounce alum to 1 gallon of water. Yellows, buff, tans, you will improve with 1 cupful of 
strained coffee added to last rinsing water. 

To Bleach Blankets which have yellowed, use hydrogen peroxide diluted to about 
an eighth of its strength, steeping the blankets over night. 

Sweaters — ^To retain original shape, take the important measurements before wet- 
ting, and stretch to these measurements while drying. Use, otherwise, same method as for 
blankets. 

To Bleach Sweater — Hang it while still wet in an upturned barrel, stretched to its 
proper measurements. Burn a sulphur candle (procurable at any drug store) under the 
barrel. The bottom of the barrel, however, is first knocked out, as well as top, leaving only 
the cylinder. Now stretch a cloth over the barrel to keep the sulphur fumes in; occasionally 
remove this to shake out the folds of the sweater. About an hour and a half treatment 
will suffice for perfect whiteness. Wash in soapy water to remove sulphur odor. 

Radiator Drying is not good. It may steam woolens ; they should dry slowly. They 
should not be pressed with an iron hot enough to make them steam in the ironing. 

CORNELL COURSE ON WASHING WOOLENS 

Washing Woolens (Cornell Reading Course) — The action of water and alkalis 
upon wool has been thoroughly studied. Strong soaps should never be used in washing 
woolens, nor should soap be applied directly to the garment. The soap should be used in 
solution. A great deal of stress is laid upon having the water used in washing flannels not 
much more than lukewarm, for at a luke'warm temperature soap and water have a less 
detrimental action on wool than at any other temperature. It is even more important than 
the lukewarm water to have all the waters used of the same temperature, in order to avoid 
changes from hot to cold water, or vice versa, as sudden changes in temperature cause 
shrinkage. 

Have two receptacles ready for washing flannels. Pour into one of them water not 
too hot for the hand to bear comfortably. Add enough soap solution made from a neutral 
or mild soap or a wool soap to make a good suds. If the water is hard, or the clothing is 
very much soiled, add a tablespoonful of borax or ammonia for each gallon of water used. 
Shake or brush the garments free from dust, and put them into the water to soak for 1 or 
I 5 minutes. Before beginning to wash the flannels, prepare a second tub of water having 
the same temperature as that of the first or a slightly higher temperature. Wash one gar- 
ment at a time by drawing through the hands and washing up and down in the water; avoid 
rubbing if possible. Pass the garments from the first to the second water; the second water 
should be a suds if the first suds has not removed all the soil. Rinse free of soap in sev- 
eral waters; be sure to keep the temperature constant. Wring through a loosely set wringer. 
Turn wrong side out and hang in a warm place, but not near a fire, as heat will cause shrink- 
age. When nearly dry, turn. When drying, shape by pulling and stretching. 

It is a mistake to ascribe all the shrinkage in woolen garments to washing. The 
moisture, heat, and movements of the body may cause a marked shrinkage. 



LAUNDRY. IRONING BOARD— GENERAL DIRECTIONS, WASHING 347 



If flannels are to be pressed, they should be allowed to dry first, and should then be 
covered with a slightly dampened piece of cheesecloth and ironed with a moderately hot 
iron. The cheesecloth draws up the fibers of the flannel, giving it the fluffy appearance of 
a new garment. Underwear and woolen stockings should be stretched into shape and 
should not be ironed. For very soiled garments special soap formula for the purpose will 
be useful. 

Blankets are washed in the same way as other woolens, except that because of 
their size, only two blankets or only one pair of them are washed at a time, and fresh water 
is used for each pair. After wringing, they may be stretched and dried on curtain stretchers. 
If stretchers are not available, blankets should hang on the line until perfectly dry, and 
occasionally the water should be squeezed from the hanging ends. To press them, fold 
them evenly and wrap them in a sheet. Keep them smooth and unwrinkled and place a 
flat board over them. Weight heavily and let them remain for several days. 

WASHING THE BED CLOTHES OTHER THAN BLANKETS 

It becomes inevitable that heavy quilts, pillows, etc., must from time to 
time be w^ashed. As disagreeable a job as this is, it is not so formidable a task as 
it seems, however, if properly gone over. It requires time and strength, though, 
and one should set aside a day for this. Select a bright sunny day and hire a good 
strong woman to help. 

Blankets have been covered in another article. (See Care of Woolens.) Pillows 
ought to be renovated oftener than they usually are. It is not difficult if you put your feathers 
into a cheesecloth bag the size of the ticking. The latter can then be removed and washed 
as often as you please, and the feathers can be renovated better if in the thin cheesecloth 
bag. 

If, however, they are in the usual ticking only, prepare 'good hot soapsuds, made 
strong w^ith ammonia and borax, and put them in to soak for an hour. As the water cools 
lift the pillows about, roll them and toss and slap them until the dirt is out of the feathers. 
Don't crush or squeeze them. Rinse in hot, soapy water, then in several clear waters, hang 
in the sun, turn and shake them as they dry. They can be dried, if neecssary, on steam 
radiators. 

Down and lambs' down comfortables are washed in the same way as pillows. Thick 
cotton filled comfortables can be washed so the cotton will not form into lumps, if very care- 
ful with them, especially if the tying in them is fairly close. In buying comfortables choose 
those which are of fast colors. 

Put comfortables into warm suds and let soak. Squeeze flat without twisting in 
wringer and put in a second tub of warm, soapy water; run through a washing machine or 
shift around in water, lifting up and down and slapping; do this in several soapy waters and 
finally in several clear warm waters, then squeeze and shake dry as possible and hang in a 
warm place in hot sun, shaking occasionally to fluff the down. If carefully done they come 
out as light as when new. 

Silk-covered comfortables should be sent to the cleaners; home washing will almost 
certainly spoil the silk.

348 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Section VI— LAUNDRY, IRONING BOARD 



Shawls, Sweaters and loosely woven jackets lose 
their shape when hung on lines to dry. To pre- 
vent this, fasten them securely with safety pins to 
a sheet stretched between two lines, or dry the 
sweaters or jackets on a "form" if you have one, 
or tack them against a sunny wall stretched only 
to the extent you want them to remain when dry. 

To Dry a Sweater another way, hang it over a 
mosquito netting hammock, the latter pulled tight, 
and the sweater spread out in position wanted and 
pinned thereto. 

Crocheted Articles of Wool — Clean them in a 
pillow case; keep them in it during the entire pro- 
cess of washing. Use abundant warm water and 
soap, and clear ^varm water for rinsing; hang on 
line still in the pillow case, on a bright windy day. 

New Stockings — Rinse them first time in water 
in which a teaspoonful of vinegar has been put, 
and they will not fade so readily. 

To Clean White Felt — Make a soft paste of mag- 
nesia and milk, cover the felt thickly, applying with 
a brush, leave till next day, then brush off with 
a clean hand brush. 

Black Felt such as an old derby hat, clean with 
household ammonia on a clean piece of muslin. 

Cleaning With Gasoline — For badly soiled ar- 
articles, make a strong lather of white soap dis- 
solved by hot water until it looks like jelly and 
add it to the gasoline, teacupful to a gallon. Soak 
the garment in this for I 5 minutes, then rub where 
necessary and ^vash between the hands; wring out 
and rinse in clean gasoline. Add a little salt to 
gasoline used for cleaning wool or silk and if pos- 
sible put a piece of cloth under it, to "drive 
through" to, and there will be no "ring" where 
cleaned. 

The gasoline can be saved for future use; let 
the dirt settle, then pour off the liquid and cork 
tightly. It should be unnecessary to say that work 
with gasoline should be in the open air and in no 
case near a fire. 

White Kid or Satin Slippers can be sponged with 
gasoline and made fresh as new 

Gasoline Cleaned Articles require no ironing. 

To Soften Flannels that have become hard and 
shrunken, restore them by soaking in gasoline and 
shaking till dry. 

"Dry" Cleaning Men's Clothes — Take a soft 
cloth, dip it in alcohol, pass it lightly over a cake 
of pure soap and apply briskly to the goods till 
cleaned. If you can put a cloth under the goods 
much of the dirt or grease will be driven through 
to the cloth and less lime required than when it 
has to be all transferred to the cleaning cloth. If 
the goods have a lining which would show stain, 
separate the goods and lining in some way to pre- 
vent this "driving through" to the lining. 



After cleaning the garment, sponge it carefully, 
then press it. The treatment, as well as cleaning 
it, restores the nap and lustre as v^hen new. In 
the case of obstinate grease spots, rub hard with 
pure white soap lather and lukewarm water, then 
apply the alcohol and soap process as above. 

White Silk — Use lukewarm water and borax, for 
washing, instead of soap. Dry by wrapping a sheet 
or blanket and iron while just a bit damp but not 
wet. 

When washing white silk always rinse in a warm 
blueing water to keep from yellowing. Many a dry 
cleaning bill can be saved by carefully laundering 
as above. 

To make silk that has been washed look like 
new, put a teaspoonful of methylated spirits to a 
pint of running water and iron while damp. 

Silk blouses can be made to look like new by 
stiffening with a little gum arabic in the rinsing 
water. One dessert-spoonful of boiling %vater and 
then silk ironed while damp. 

Yellow Chiffon — Use gasoline, plenty of it. 
Souse the chiffon in, shaking up and down and 
around, and if there are spots upon it rub them 
gently between the hands. Change the gasoline as 
it becomes cloudy for fresh. When the chiffon is 
clean hang it in the wind, pulling it into shape 
now and then. When you are ready to put it back 
upon the dress lay between two thicknesses of fine 
muslin slightly dampened and press with warm iron 
lightly, not to spoil the general effect. 

Chiffon Veils — Subject these to a thorough wash- 
ing with soap and water. Prepare a bath of warm 
water and white soap, lay the veil in and lift up 
and down, squeezing through the hands until quite 
clean. Then rinse in clear water — warm water 
if the veil is ^vhite, and a few drops of ammonia 
if the veil is colored. To dry, pin it on table or 
bed, and iron. Although chiffon irons perfectly, 
it is more like new when not ironed, and in the 
case of a dotted veil pressing of any kind is not 
advised — the dots will surely show the impress. 

Net Veils — For net veils of every description 
squeeze through alcohol to freshen and remove 
dust. Wash in gasoline. Use sufficient fluid to 
cover the article. Squeeze through the hands sev- 
eral times, then rinse in clear gasoline. This will 
probably be quite black when one has finished if 
the veil is black, but when dry the veil will be a 
deep black and the dots, if any, very glossy. 

Crepe de Chine After washing crepe de chine 

or georgette crepe in warm water with a mild 
white soap, rinse in clear warm water, roll in a 
Turkish towel and do not iron till next day. 

Blue Serge To remove the shine from a dark 

blue serge sponge occasionally with a strong blu- 
ing water, then press (not iron) carefully. 



LAUNDRY. IRONING BOARD— GENERAL DIRECTIONS. WASHING 349 



A Black Frock may be freshened by sponging 
it with alcohol mixed with water in the propor- 
tion of I part alcohol to 3 of water. The gar- 
ment should be sponged on the right side, but 
ironed on the wrong. 

CORNELL COURSE ON SILK 
Washing Silk (Cornell Reading Course) — Silk 
should be washed in much the same way as wool. 
While it is not so strongly affected by soaps and 
alkalies as is wool, its gloss is destroyed by the 
use of strong cleansing agents. The delicacy of 
the fiber makes hard rubbing impossible, for it 
breaks the fibers and destroys not only their dura- 



bility but also their silkiness. In wringing silk, 
place it between dry towels or heavy cloths and 
put it through a loosely adjusted wringer, iron it 
on the wrong side while still damp, with a mod- 
erately hot iron. Silk is very easily scorched, and 
if the iron is too hot the silk will be stiff. Push 
the iron back and forth with a wriggling motion 
to give softness and pliability to the silk. It is 
often best to iron silk under a cloth; to do so gives 
less body and a softer finish. Ribbons, if of good 
quality, may be very successfully washed. To iron 
them, cover them with a dry cloth and move the 
iron frequently back and forth over the surface of 
the cloth above them. 



LINENS AND COTTONS 



To Launder Table Linen (Cornell Reading 
Course) — Apparatus: tub. washboard or washing 
machine, soap, ironing table with blanket and 
sheet, hot irons, and cloth for cleaning irons. 

Weuhing — Remove all stains. Soak overnight 
if possible in softened water. Wash in hot water, 
using soap and the board or machine. Boil or 
scald fifteen minutes in soapy water. Rinse in cold 
water. Rinse in cold bluing water. Dry out of 
doors if possible. 

Note: For old linen add I cupful of boiled 
starch to each gallon of bluing water. 

Dampening — Dampen well. Roll up tightly and 
let lie over night if possible. 

Ironing — General rules: Pull well into shape. 
Have the irons very hot. Press heavily. Iron un- 
til perfectly dry. Ironing and folding a table nap- 
kin; place the napkin on the table wrong side up 
with the name on the upper right hand corner. 
Fold the lower edge to within '/8 inch of the upper 
edge and iron. Fold the lower edge even with 
the upper edge and iron. Fold the left-hand edge 
to within j/g inch of the right-hand edge and iron. 
Turn over and iron the remaining square. Fold 
the left edge even with the right hand edge and 
iron. 

Ironing and folding a table cloth in the screen 
fold of four: Fold the cloth lengthwise, wrong side 
out. Fold again lengthwise. Drop one selvage and 
bring it back to the folded edge on the opposite 
side. Place lengthwise on the ironing table and iron 
the top quarter. Open and iron the middle 
quarters. Fold the middle quarters together and 
iron the remaining quarter. 

Note: If the cloth is very large or the table very 
narrow, it is better to fold it in two, right side out. 
iron both sides, and refold in the screen fold. 

Fine Table Linens An authority on fine laun- 

lering says that hot water should not be used in 
/ashing fine table linen or embroidered doilies. Cold 
'ater, white soap and borax, if not a borax soap. 



should be used. If a gloss is desired for linen add 
a teaspoonful of salt to the starch when making. 

WHITE LINEN AND COTTONS 
Outline for Washing (Cornell Reading Course) 

Put water on to heat. Make soap solution. Rinse 

clothes from water in which they have soaked. 
Wash clothes in warm suds in the following order: 
Table linen and clean towels; bed linen; body lin- 
en; handkerchiefs; soiled towels and cloths; stock- 
ings. Waah again in clean suds; wring. Boil in 
clean, slightly soapy water. Rinse in clean, clear 
water; wring. Rinse in bluing water; wring. Starch. 
Hang to dry. Remove from line, dampen, and fold. 

COLORED LINENS AND COTTONS 

Colored Goods — Add J/2 ounce of Epsom salts 
to 2 quarts of clear water and you will have a good 
mixture for rinsing colored frocks and blouses. 

A little borax in the water before washing red 
or red-bordered goods will alone often prevent 
their fading. 

Dark calicoes should be ironed on the wrong 
side with irons that are not too hot. 

To prevent the fading of ginghams, calicoes and 
lawns, dissolve 5 cents' worth of sugar of lead in 
a pailful of lukewarm water. Put the goods in and 
let stand tv^ro or three hours. Wring out, dry and 
press in the usual way. The process also shrinks 
the goods. 

To Bleach faded cotton wash in boiling cream 
of tartar water. 

Cotton Voiles — When washing cotton voiles, if 
after they are washed and dried they are dipped in 
a solution of gum arabic and water ( I teaspoonful 
powdered gum arabic to I pint), rolled in a cloth 
and ironed wet. the garments will look quite new. 

Near-Fireproofing Muslins, Laces, etc. — Muslins 
and laces may be rendered much less inflammable 
by simply mixing with the starch used in launder- 
ing an equal quantity of whiting. 



350 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Section VI— LAUNDRY, IRONING BOARD 



CURTAINS, LACES, ETC. 



Dyeing Curtains — An excellent dye for lace or 
muslin curtains: save the tea-remains from the tea- 
pot; keep the tea savings and leaves in a covered 
jar, and when you have sufficient, strain through 
a fine sieve and add the liquid to a pan of ordinary 
starch wrater Dip one end of the curtains, and if 
the color is too dark add more starch water. If 
too light add more of the tea savings. 

Net Curtains — To be sure they will dry straight 
put them on the poles at the window while still 
wet, and they will fall into graceful folds, as they 
dry. Otherwise dry on a frame or pinned to a 
wall. 

If allowed to dry thoroughly before starching 
curtains will remain clean longer. 

To Wash Laces — White laces that have become 
discolored from perspiration should not be put im- 
mediately into hot water. Soak them first in cold 
water, rubbing them well with pure soap. If the 
pan of water is set out in the sun it will aid in the 
bleaching process. Later rinse and squeeze the 
lace in warm water and soap suds, rinsing again 
in clear water very slightly blued. Laces may also 
be bleached snowy white by basting them to card- 
board, and setting out in the sun. The laces must 
be wet when basted to the cardboard. When 
bleached and dry they will need no ironing. 

To Clean Lace — Salted flour or powdered starch 
mixed with borax and rubbed into every thread 
of the lace will clean it. Lay it away with a fresh 
supply of powder for three days, then shake and 
brush it thoroughly and you will find it very clean 
and fresh. 

Another plan is to mix gasoline and powdered 
magnesia and rub this into the lace. Leave the mix- 
ture on over night and apply again. Shake out 
and brush carefully. 

Milk for Lace — It is well, when washing a piece 
of choice yellow lace, to dip it in milk before iron- 
ing. Always place a piece of tissue paper directly 
over the lace, so the warm iron will not touch the 
fabric. 

Black Lace Wash in mixture of half vinegar 

and half water; heat together until lukewarm; wash 
without soap: rinse in a similar solution, put in a 
cloth and iron on wrong side until dry, between 
two thicknesses of cloth. 

Washing Lace Collars — First baste them on a 
piece of white cloth; they will not be torn or 
stretched, and if no starch is used they will look 
like new. 

To Clean White Lace, without laundering it, 
spread it smoothly on wrapping paper and sprinkle 



it freely with calcined magnesia, then place another 
piece of paper over it, and put away under a heavy 
weight for several days. Dust off the magnesia 
and the lace will be found almost as fresh as when 
first purchased. 

Fine Laces should never be starched, they will 
generally be stiff enough if ironed while very damp, 
the ironing being continued until they are dry. 

To Clean Gold Lace — Buy some rock ammonia 
from a chemist, pound it finely and apply it with 
a piece of clean flannel to the lace, rubbing briskly. 
After a thorough brushing the lace will look good 
as new. 

To Tint Lace Wait until it is dry after washing, 

then dip it into weak tea. If a little stiffness is de- 
sired a cube of sugar may be added to the tea. 

CORNELL COURSE ON LACES 

Washing Laces (Cornell Reading Course) — It is 
often best to dry-clean fine laces, as they thicken 
slightly in washing. To wash them, use a warm 
neutral soap-solution to which has been added am- 
monia or borax. Squeeze out the dirt by pressing 
the lace in the hands, but do not rub it; rubbing 
breaks the delicate threads. A good way to wash 
fine lace is to baste it to strips of cheesecloth, being 
careful to catch down all its points. Put it to soak 
over night in warm soapy water containing a little 
borax or ammonia. Wash it, by squeezing, then 
rinse it free of soap. Old yellow lace may be 
bleached by stretching it, while wet, around a bot- 
tle, and standing it in the sun, rewetting the lace 
occasionally. Javelle water may be used to bleach 
lace. Lace may be stiffened by rinsing in a mix- 
ture of 2 tablespoonfuls of alcohol to I cupful of 
water; by rinsing in borax water, 2 tablespoonfuls 
to a cup; or by using gum arabic, f/g teaspoonful 
to a cupful of water. If a yellow color is desired, 
dip the lace in coffee or tea. 

Black lace should be cleaned by squeezing it 
repeatedly in a mixture of 1 cupful of strong coffee 
and 1 tablespoonful of ammonia. Rinse in gum 
arabic water made with coffee, to give natural stiff- 
ness. 

Lace curtains should be washed with as near an 
approach to the care given to lace as is practi- 
cable. Clear-starch them, stretch them, and pin 
them out on sheets, one curtain over another. If 
available, it is better to use curtain stretchers than 
sheets, but if care is taken to square off the first 
curtain and stretch it straight and even, good re- 
sults may be obtained by pinning the curtains to 
sheets.

CLEANING FURS, GLOVES, ETC. 



To Clean Furs — Hot sand and sawdust rubbed 
into furs and then beaten out with light rattan 
sticks, clean and make them look like new. Use 
clean sand. Ermine and other white furs treated 
similarly with plaster of paris and corn starch will 
be freshened and softened. 

Sponging Furs — Sponge furs with gasoline. Dry 
in the open air and brush with hat brush until 
smooth. Or sponge freely with alcohol, and while 
the fur is wet sift it down to the roots with all the 
finely powdered fuller's earth it will hold. Shut 
up in a box for two days and brush out the pow- 
der. 

Soiled Gloves — To clean kid gloves when slightly 
soiled take a teaspoonful of powdered French 
chalk. Put the gloves on the hands and the chalk 
into the palm of one glove and rub the hand and 
fingers together as if w^ashing your hands. Take 
off the gloves without shaking them and lay them 
aside for a night. Put them on and clap the hands 
or wipe the gloves with a clean cloth. Fuller's 
earth will do nearly as well. 

White kid gloves can be cleaned on the hands 
w^ith oatmeal and benzine mixture to a paste. Con- 
tinue rubbing till the paste drops off in dry flakes. 

Yellow Gloves or Hose — For gloves that have 
turned yellow or hose yellowed by the feet, or white 
hose that are stained, pour gasoline over till mois- 
tened, leave ten minutes, then w^ash in lukew^arm 
water and plenty of white soap; rinse in cold water 
to which a teaspoonful of gasoline has been added. 

To Dye Gloves — White kid gloves can be dyed 
tan by dipping them in saffron water until the 
desired shade is obtained. 



Black Gloves — Black kid or suede gloves that 
wear white at the ends, can be made to look like 
new^; mix a little good black ink with |/2 teaspoon- 
ful of olive oil and apply to the faded parts with 
a feather. Let the gloves dry thoroughly before 
w^earing them. 

To Wash Chamois Leather (Cornell Reading 
Course) — Apparatus: warm water and washing 
soda, soap, and a clean towel. 

Dissolve !/g cupful washing soda iit 2 quarts of 
lukewarm water. 

Soak the chamois in the soda w^ater 1 5 to 60 
minutes, according to dirtiness. 

Lift the chamois into a basin of w^arm, strong 
soapsuds, and squeeze and work them with the 
hands until clean. Be careful not to rub or wring 
them. Very soiled places may be put on a smooth 
surface and brushed w^ith a small brush. 

Rinse thoroughly in w^arm, soft water. Press 
as much w^ater out as possible by pulling through 
the hand. Roll in the tow^el and w^ring tightly. 
Stretch well in all directions and hang to dry. 

Stretch and rub the chamois two or three times 
while they are drying. 

Chamois Gloves — White chamois gloves after be- 
ing washed are usually stiff, and it is difficult to 
get them on again. Let them become partially 
dry, then fit them on the hand, after w^hich care- 
fully remove, keeping the gloves the shape of the 
hands; let them dry thus in the model of the hand. 

Wring chamois out of the soapy water without 
rinsing, and w^hen it dries it is soft and serviceable 
instead of stiff.

THE LAUNDRY— MISCELLANEOUS 



Laundry Container — A wicker hamper is perhaps the ideal laundry con- 
tainer, but it must be kept clean. One enameled white looks so clean that it is hard 
to remember that it may harbor impurities and germs. It must be washed in hot 
water occasionally, and dried in the sunshine, and then further refreshed with a 
clean coat of enamel. 

Laundry bags in the different rooms can be emptied every day into the 
hamper. These bags should be of a sort easily washed, and should be washed 
every couple of weeks. 

A big white enameled tin box is an admirable holder for laundry from a 
nursery or sick room. This should be emptied, scalded and aired every day — 
the laundry being put into boiling water or a disinfecting fluid. 



SOAP 



Soap (Cornell Reading Course "The Laun- 
dry") There is much difference of opinion as to 

which kind of lye produces the better soap. The 
question is settled "practically" in favor of sodium 
lye, for it can be produced at a smaller cost. It 
is safe to say that much of the soap on the market 
is made from sodium lye. 

When lye is mixed with a fat it breaks the fat 
up into fatty acids and glycerin, of which it is com- 
posed. The lye unites with the fatty acids to form 
a new compound, called soap, and glycerin re- 
mains. This is the process of soap-making called 
saponification. The nature of the soap formed will 
depend, first, on the nature of the fats used, 
whether they are hard or soft, clean or rancid; 
second, on the kind of alkali used, whether potash 
lye or soda lye; third, on the nature and amount 
of impurities in both fat and alkali; fourth, on the 
completeness of the process of soap-making or sa- 
ponification. If the operation of soap-making is 
not properly conducted, the reaction between the 
fat and the lye is incomplete, and a soap is pro- 
duced that contains free fat and an undue amount 
of free alkali. Such soap is greasy, unduly active, 
and a poor cleansing agent. 

The Adulteration of Soap — It is not uncommon 
to find some foreign, insoluble substances in soap, 
which have been added merely to increase its 
weight and bulk. In cheap soaps resin is often 
added as an adulterant. It is rather difHcult to say 
when resin may be considered an adulterant, for 
in small quantities it is of value in laundry soaps 
because it whitens the clothing. Resin gives a 
brown color to soap, therefore a dark brown soap 
may be safely rejected as containing an excess of 
resin. 

The best advice to give the housekeeper is: Se- 
lect soap manufactured by a reliable firm and give 
it a trial. It is not economy to use a cheap, poorly 
made soap in the laundry. A common mistake 



is to think that the use of one kind of soap will 
prove satisfactory for all purposes; this common 
belief possibly accounts for much of the dissatis- 
faction that exists regarding the various soaps on 
the market. Every laundry should contain three 
grades of soap, mild, medium, strong. A mild soap 
should alw^ays be used in washing flannels, woolen 
goods, or fabrics either frail or delicate in color. 
A medium soap should be used for the more dur- 
able colored goods. A strong soap is best for most 
white goods, both cotton and linen. 

Soap Is Antiseptic — Aside from its use in remov- 
ing dirt, soap has antiseptic properties. It is not 
safe to depend on it as the only disinfectant in 
cases of contagious diseases, but it is a valuable 
purifier for the ordinary household washing. 

Home-Made Soap — A question often arises as 
to the advisability of using kitchen w^aste fats in 
making home-made soap. While some housekeep- 
ers may find such use an economy, the fact re- 
mains that home-made soaps are generally poorly 
made and of inferior quality. 

Washing Powders — Something should be said of 
washing powders. They are mixtures of soap and 
some alkali, such as lye, w^ashing soda, and borax, 
and may have incorporated with them some one 
or more of the substances of the nature of turpen- 
tine, paraffin. Fuller's earth. In the case of the 
poorer powders a "filler" is used; that is, a sub- 
stance to give weight to the powder and very prop- 
erly considered an adulterant. The best powders 
contain large amounts of soap and only small 
amounts of alkali. A report is made, however, of 
one of the poorer varieties of washing powder con- 
taining only 1 per cent of soap. There may be 
occasions when washing powder is desirable, but 
indiscrinninate use of these strong cleansing agents 
is inadvisable and should not be generally indulged 
in.

SOAP FORMULAS AND SUBSTITUTES 



Home-Made Soap — Take I pound can lye dis- 
solved in 3 pints cold water, 5 pounds fat melted, 
I Yi tablespoonfuls borax and Yi cupful ammonia. 

When lye mixture has cooled add it to fat, stir 
until as thick as honey, pour into wooden or paste- 
board boxes lined with oiled or waxed paper, set 
away to harden. 

Soap Bark — One pound soap bark equals 2 
pounds soft soap. Use in place of soap. 

Bran — Take 1 cupful bran, I quart water. Boil 
half hour. Strain, boil bran in a second quart of 
water Yl hour. When needed, reduce with warm 
water. 

Potato Water — Grate 2 large-sized potatoes into 
1 pint clean, clear, soft water. Strain into I gal- 
lon water, let liquid settle. Pour off and use. 

Soap Solution for Colored Goodf — One-quarter 
pound mild or medium soap to I gallon of water. 

Soap Solution, Ordinary Purposes — One bar of 

ordinary washing soap, 2 to 3 quarts of water; 
shave soap and put into saucepan with cold %vater. 
Heat gradually until soap is dissolved (about I 
hour). 

Soap Solution for Soaking Clothes — One bar of 
ordinary soap, 3 gallons of water, Yl *o ^ table- 
spoonful turpentine, I to 3 tablespoonfuls ammonia. 

Soap Solution, Much Soiled Woolens and Deli- 
cate Colors — Half a pound of very mild or neutral 
soap, Ya pound borax, 3 quarts of water. 

Soap Jelly mth Turpentine — One bar soap, I 



quart water, I teaspoonful turpentine or kerosene. 

For Washing Delicate Fabrics and colors, a 
liquid may be made from laundry starch, grated 
potatoes, rice, flour, etc. The water in which rice 
has boiled may be saved and utilized for the same 
purpose. The cleansing liquid after cooking should 
be as thick as cream, and should be diluted from 
I to 4 times, according to the amount of dirt in 
the clothing. Rinse clothing in a more dilute solu- 
tion, which may be blued for white clothes. 

A Good Laundry Soap — Five pounds good, clean 
grease free from all water, I can potash or lye, I/4 
cupful kerosene, Ya cupful ammonia, 2 tablespoon- 
fuls powdered borax, I cents' worth oil of sassa- 
fras. Dissolve the potash in 5 cupfuls of cold 
water thoroughly: melt the grease and strain 
through an old stocking into the potash, stirring 
all the time, mixing the kerosene, ammonia and 
borax together, and then add the oil of sassafras. 
Have a deep pan lined with brown paper and pour 
in the soap; when set mark off in squares and put 
away to harden. Will make 30 cakes. 

Soap Improves with keeping, so it should always 
be bought in large quantities. Before storing it, 
however, it is well to cut the bars into convenient 
pieces, for this is most easily done when it is soft. 
The cutting may be done with a piece of string or 
wire more easily than with a knife. 

Brown Soaps usually contain resin and soda 
and are injurious to colored clothes; resin is in- 
jurious to flannel and ^voolens; neither should be 
washed with such soap. 



STARCH, STARCH SUBSTITUTES, ACCESSORIES 



Starch, Substitutes, Accessories (Cornell Read- 
ing Course) — Directions for using: In making 
starch a naturally soft water is greatly to be de- 
sired* but if the water furnished is hard it should 
be softened with borax, not with washing soda or 
lye, since the latter tend to produce a yellow^ color 
with starch. 

One-quarter cupful wheat starch to I quart 
water gives flexible, light, durable starch. 

One-quarter cupful cornstarch to I quart water 
gives moderate body stiffness. 

One-half cupful w^heat starch to I quart water 
gives flexible, firm finish. 

One-half cupful cornstarch to I quart water 
gives stiff body flnish. 

A mixture of the two starches may be varied, 
to produce any desired result. 

Directions for Cooking Starch — Starch should 
first be mixed with a little cold water and then 
stirred slowly into boiling w^ater and cooked in 
accordance with the following directions: 

If w^heat starch is used, cook slowly at least 25 
or 30 minutes. 



If cornstarch is used, cook slowly 15 or 20 min- 
utes. 

If a mixture of wheat starch and cornstarch is 
used, the wheat starch should be added first and 
cooked 1 5 minutes. The cornstarch should then 
be added and the mixture cooked 15 minutes 
longer. Stir mixture frequently, to prevent stick' 
ing and formation of a skin. 

Thorough cooking of starch is very desirable in 
laundry practice, for it increases the penetrability 
of the starch and decreases its tendency to stick 
to the iron. If borax, lard, butter, kerosene, or 
other like substance is used it should be cooked 
with the starch, to insure thorough mixing. 

Thick Starch — One-half cupful starch, mixed 
with Yz cupful cold water, 1 quart boiling water, 
J/2 to I level tablespoonful borax, '/^ level table- 
spoonful lard or butter or kerosene or turpentine, 
or '/^-inch square wax or paraffin. Mix and cook 
as directed under directions for cooking starch. 

Thin Starch — One-half cupful starch, mixed with 
1/2 cupful cold water, 3 quarts boiling water; other 



LAUNDRY. IRONING BOARD— MATERIALS 



355 



ingredients same as for thick starch: mix, cook 
a« directed. 

Clear Starch — Dilute Yi cupful thick starch with 
I quart hot water. 

Clear starch is used for thin muslins, infants 
dresses, etc. 

Raw Starch — Same proportions as for thick 
starch: use borax, but omit fatty substances; stir 
thoroughly before using. 

Raw starch is often used with very thick or very 
thin goods, to increase their stiffness. A fabric 
will take up a greater amount of starch in the raw 
form than in the cooked form. The desired stifr- 
ness is produced by the cooking given the raw 
starch by the heat of the iron. The difficulty of 
ironing is increased by using raw starch, for unless 
the ironer is skillful the starch cooks on the iron 
and starch specks are then produced in the clothes. 
Moreover, raw starch gives a less durable finish 
than does cooked starch. 

Rice Starch — One-quarter cupful of rice and 1 
quart boiling water. Wash rice, cook in water 
until very soft. As water evaporates, add more to 
keep quantity up to 1 quart. When cooked add 
another quart boiling water. Strain, without squeez- 
ing, through double thickness cheesecloth or 



through flannel. Use while hot. The moat satis- 
factory starch for delicate fabrics Is rice starch, 
and it may be used in place of clear starch. 

Glue for Stiffening Dark Clothes — Twelve ounces 
dark glue, I quart water. Boil together until glue 
is dissolved, cool somewhat. Dip the garment to 
be stiffened into glue and wipe off excess of glue 
with piece of black cheesecloth, satwen or calico. 
After sprinkling roll garment in black cloth and 
iron on ironing board covered with black cloth. 
Any glue left over may be saved and used again. 

To Increase Stiffness — Partly dry garment be- 
fore starching. Add I tablespoonful powdered 
gum arabic reduced to liquid in Yl cupful boiling 
water, to the stiff starch mixture. Or use borax. 
Or add a small amount of glue to starch mixture. 
Dry quickly. 

Gum Arabic as a Starch Substitute — Four table- 
spoonfuls pulverized guni arabic, I pint cold water, 
3 tablespoonfuls alcohol. Put water and gum ara- 
bic in saucepan and set into saucepan containing 
boiling water. When dissolved strain through 
cheesecloth, cool, add alcohol, pour into a bottle, 
cork, set away for use. The alcohol acts as a pre- 
servative and the mixture may be kept for any 
length of time. 



BLUING AND MISCELLANIES 



Bluing (Cornell Reading Course) — White fab- 
rics have naturally a creamy tint, which may be 
deepened to an unpleasant pale yellow by careless 
washing, by insufficient rinsing, or by lack of ex- 
posure to the bleaching influence of sunlight and 
fresh air. Bluing is used to hide the yellow color, 
because blue and yellow are complementary col- 
ors, and when used together in proper proportions 
give the effect of whiteness. Bluing is unwarrant- 
ably used to hide a yellowness which comes from 
careless washing. 

No one kind of bluing may be recommended to 
the housekeeper. She must experiment for herself, 
choose one good variety, and learn to use that one 
properly. 

Sufficient bluing should be used to make a little 
of the bluing water taken up in the cup of the hand 
show a pale sky-blue color. More than that amount 
of bluing should not be needed. It is always best 
to make a small amount of strong bluing in a bowl 
of water, then draw from it to color the %vater in 
the tub. 

Blue — To prevent blue from streaking clothes 
mix I dessert-spoonful of soda in the bluing water. 

Marking Linen — To mark fine linen with indel- 
ible ink, without blurring or spreading, first starch 
and iron the goods smoothly. The writing may 
then be made small and neat and will remain clear- 
cut and distinct. 



To Hang Skirts — The right way — especially 
pique, cotton or woolen skirts — is to pin them to 
the line by the waistband so that they will hang 
straight down. If pinned at the top they will 
shrink evenly all around instead of sagging, as they 
too often do when pinned by the hem. 

Bleaching (Cornell Reading Course) — In fornier 
times, dependence was placed on sunshine, fresh 
air and a greensward for bleaching all manufac- 
tured cottons and linens. Such dependence on 
natural agents has been obviated by the ability to 
procure similar results from the use of chen)icals. 

In the home laundry, we still use natural agents 
to whiten and purify household linen. That is the 
greatest advantage which the home laundry has 
over the commercial laundry; in the latter, in a 
majority of cases, clothes are dried in steam clos- 
ets, and some chemical must replace the sun's rays 
to bleach a garment left yellow by washing. The 
action of the sun and air is not merely to bleach 
but to disinfect, and clothes thus dried have a fresh- 
ness and sweetness that cannot be duplicated by 
any other method. 

Occasionally, even in the household, it may be 
necessary to supplement the natural bleaching 
process by the use of chemicals. If a garment has 
yellow^ed by age or by being packed away writh 
starch in it, it may be expedient to use a chemical 
bleach. 



336 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Section VI— LAUNDRY. IRONING BOARD 



The best bleach to use is javelle water, which 
should be made as follows: 

Javelle Water — One pound washing soda, Yl 
pound chlorid of lime, I quart boiling water, 2 
quarts cold water. Put soda in granite pan, add 
boiling water and stir until dissolved; let cool. 
Dissolve chlorid of lime in cold water; let settle and 
pour the clear liquid into the soda; let settle. Pour 
oS clear liquid, bottle and put away in dark place. 

Use, mixed with equal parts or more of water, 
and do not let the garments stay in over J/2 hour. 
Rinse thoroughly in several waters, and lastly in 
dilute ammonia water. 

Moisture is necessary if clothes are to be 
bleached by the action of the sun. After a gar- 
ment dries, it should be made wet again and hung 
out. It may be necessary to repeat the wetting 
process a number of times before the yellow tinge 
fades and yields. It is said that clothes are whit- 
ened if they are allowed to freeze out of doors on 
the line. The reason given for the bleaching 
action is that freezing causes the clothes to retain 
moisture, hence the time of their bleaching is pro- 
longed. 



To Save Hands — A little vinegar placed in the 
rinsing water on washing day will prevent the 
hands froni becoming rough and chapped. 

To Set Colors — Green, blue, lavender, aniline 
red, purple and pink should be soaked in alum 
water, 2 ounces to a tub. Black, gray and dark 
blue should soak in strong salted water. 

To Clean a Raincoat — Use soap and water and 
not gasoline, as the latter will injure the rubber 
in the fabric. Lay out on a flat surface and scrub 
lightly with soap and water. Do not wring. Put 
on a coat-hanger and hang to dry. 

Shiny Skirt — Turpentine is a ready remedy for 
removing the shine from a dark skirt. Rub the 
affected parts with a small piece of flannel dipped 
in the turpentine and hang the garment in the open 
air to renjove the odor of the turpentine. 

Paraffin in Starch — ^To secure smoothness and 
glossiness when ironing starched pieces stir the 
starch three or four times >vhile boiling and just 
ready to remove with a paraffin candle.

THE IRONING BOARD 

Women are more and more sensible each generation about cutting down 
on unnecessary work; one of the first places of which this is true is the laundry. 
They do not iron everything, as their grandmothers did, perspiring over a hot stove 
all day. They have found that an hour or two in the early mornings of two days 
"pays better" whether done by themselves or by a maid ; and where they have elec- 
tricity they use the modern electric iron and take the work calmly and cool. 

Hosiery, knit underwear, rough towels, many other articles, and even 
sheets, may just as well be laid away without the ironing process. By sensible 
hanging at the line, taking down as well as putting up, such garments may be left 
smooth enough for the nature of their use. If such pieces can be hung up without 
wringing, just a little of the water squeezed or pressed out, they do not shrink so 
readily and are less likely to need the iron. Cotton crepes and other goods that are 
not to be ironed will look better if hung up dripping wet. Crepe dresses and 
sweaters are best ironed by slipping over a coat-hanger to dry in shape. And many 
things besides lace curtains — including scrim and muslin curtains, by the way — are 
best dried on a curtain stretcher without ironing. 

Table linen, however, will bear no subterfuge. It must have a piping hot 
iron and the linen must be quite damp. 

With napkins, it is suggested that they all be ironed before folding, as it 
gives them a chance to thoroughly dry before folding, and saves time and labor; but 
the final effect is not so perfect as if finished one at a time and folded as ironed, 
with the iron run over each fold as made. 

Linen and corded goods must never be ironed on the bias, as it will leave 
them out of shape. Iron lengthwise or crossways always. 

CORNELL COURSE ON IRONING 

Ironing (Cornell Reading Course) — While a knowledge of conditions aids greatly 
in ironing, as in other operations, experience and skill are necessary to accomplish good 
results. Ease of ironing and the quality of the product depend on the skill of the operator, or 
the care that has been used in starching, drying, folding and sprinkling the clothes to be 
ironed, and on the kind and condition of the irons. If the garments have been poorly and 
carelessly starched, the work of ironing is greatly increased. Starchy lumps cook on the 
iron and damage its smoothness, even when the lumps are immediately removed. The rea- 
son for allowing clothes to stand over night after sprinkling is to give them an even damp- 
ness that makes ironing easy and successful. If starched goods have been overdampened 
the starch is brought to the surface, and a result is produced similar to that of careless starch- 
ing. If linen is too dry it cannot be made smooth and free from wrinkles. If it is too wet 
the process of ironing is laborious. 

It is said that irons that are to be used for starched garments should not be polished 
by rubbing them on salt or emery paper. A better method is to procure a good yellow pine 
board, free from all sand and dirt, and rub it with a hot iron until a hard coat of burned 
resin is produced. The board may be used for polishing the iron. The iron should occasion- 
ally be wiped with a piece of wax or paraffin and then with a clean cloth. 

Have ready and at hand : a flat, firm, unwarped ironing board or table, tightly cov- 
ered with a blanket and clean sheet, securely fastened underneath; clean irons; an iron stand, 
which may well consist of a clean brick; two pieces of old cloth for cleaning irons; a piece of 

359 



360 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Section VI— LAUNDRY, IRONING BOARD 

paper folded several times for testing irons; a piece of beeswax or paraffin tied in a cloth, 
for keeping irons smooth; a bowl of water and a clean cloth for moistening parts dried by 
exposure to air. Spread a large paper or place a blanket under the ironing board to receive 
the clothes while they are being ironed. 

For ordinary ironing a good, firm surface is desirable. A thin woolen blanket and 
an outside linen cover are sufficient. For embroideries or wool a thick covering is better, as 
the fabric should sink into a soft foundation to bring out the pattern in one case and to give 
a soft finish in the other. 

The following simple rules for ironing may be followed : 

Iron first that part of the garment which will be least mussed by further handling, 
or in which a little wrinkling will not seriously interfere with good results. 

If the garment is trimmed, iron laces and embroideries first, as they dry out quickly 
because of their porous nature. 

Leave as much of a garment folded as possible, to keep it moist. Sometimes it may 
be convenient to lay a piece of dampened cheesecloth over any unironed part to keep it 
moist. 

Silk Waists — Iron on wrong side while still damp. 

Embroideries — Iron on wrong side on soft foundation, to allow design to stand out. 

Laces — Lay on piece of flannel covered with a piece of cheesecloth. Iron on wrong 
side and pull out points with tip of iron. Lace should be stretched and pinned out on a hard 
surface. Pull out at each point and catch down with a pin; or stretch and roll on a bottle. 

Flannels — Iron after Ia3ang a dampened cheesecloth over them. If they are not 
covered with a damp cloth, iron on wrong side; have the iron only moderately hot. 

Colored Garments — Iron on wrong side, to prevent fading; do not have irons too 
hot. 

Silk Garments — Iron on wrong side, to prevent shininess. 

After Ironing each article should be hung on a frame or clotheshorse to dry and air 
before it is put away; if hung in a poorly ventilated room the clothes will have a bad odor. 

Sprinkling may not be necessary when an ironing machine is used for ironing, if the 
operator will remove the clothes from the line at the right time, that is, while they are still 
damp. The process can be carried through so quickly that it is unnecessary to keep one 
garment damp while the other is being ironed. 



IRONS AND OTHER UTENSILS 



Irons (Cornell Reading Course) — A number of 
irons are now on the market for summer use when 
it is not desirable to have sufficient fire in the 
range to heat the irons. Some of these are: elec- 
tric irons, gas irons, and, most practical of all for 
the country home, denatured-alcohol irons. 

For general laundry purposes one size of the 
ordinary sadiron is sufficient, but it is advisable to 
put several irons into a well-equipped laundry, to 
use for the various kinds of work to be done. 
Among them should be heavy, medium-heavy, and 
small pointed irons, the last for ironing ruffles, 
laces, etc. 

A frequent cause of poor ironing is the condi- 
tion of the irons. They must be kept clean and 
free from rust to do good work. New irons should 
be heated thoroughly and rubbed with wax or 
grease before using. If irons are to be put away 
for any length of time they should be covered with 



a thin coating of vaseline, clean grease or paraffin, 
or wrapped in wax paper. If starch cooks on, it 
should be removed immediately ^vith a dull knife. 
If irons become dirty from careless use, or from 
being left on the stove during the preparation of 
the meals, they should *be thoroughly washed with 
soap and water and carefully dried. To keep irons 
smooth when using them, rub with wax or paraffin 
and wipe immediately with a clean cloth. They 
improve with Virear if they have good treatment. 

Tubs — Stationary tubs are best, even though 
running water is not available, for some simple 
method of draining them can always be devised. 
They are better if made of porcelain, enameled 
iron, or alberine stone. Wooden tubs may be 
more cheaply constructed, but there is danger of 
the wooden tub becoming unsanitary from careless 
handling. 



LAUNDRY. IRONING BOARD— MATERIALS

Stationary tubs should be always set with regard 
to the height of the person who is to use them 
most. Many tubs are set far too low, and neces- 
sitate too much back bending on the part of the 
operator. 

Laundry Bench — The laundry bench for holding 
tubs should be of the proper height; they are usu- 
ally set too low. 

Wringer — A wringer should be a part of the 
laundry equipment, and the best on the market is 
usually the cheapest. After using a wringer, it 
should be carefully dried, and the screws pressing 
the rollers should be loosened. When not in use 
it should be kept covered with a cloth to protect it 
from dust and dirt. The bearings should be oiled 
occasionally. Oil dissolves rubber, and that prop- 
erty is taken advantage of in cleaning the rubber 
rollers; they are carefully wiped with a little kero- 
sene. The operation should not be performed 
frequently, however, and the oil should be care- 
fully and completely removed immediately after 
use. 

Ironing Board — The blanket and sheet should be 
put on tightly and smoothly and tacked securely 
under the board, using short brass-headed tacks. 
It is well to have a separate blanket and sheet also, 
which fit the table used in the laundry, as a table 
is a convenient place for ironing large pieces. The 
ironing sheet should be kept clean. 

Sleeve Board — A sleeve board is good not only 
for sleeves but for gathers and for small dresses. 
It is not difficult to manufacture at home. 

Attach to the Wall the broader end of the iron- 
ing board, with hinges: it is a great convenience, for 
then it is always in place, and can be put out of 
the way by folding up against the wall. 

Ragged Articles — If an article is ragged, fold it 
with the tear visible, not hid. You may be saved 
the embarrassment of taking it out for use thinking 
it whole, and only learning later when it is opened 
"in company." The man of the house will par- 
ticularly endorse this "pointer" if applied to his 
handkerchiefs. 

Buttons and Mending — While ironing, notice 
pieces needing repairs or buttons; place them on 
one side to go to the mending basket before put 
away. 

Ironing Board Covers that are strong, durable 
and easily removed for laundering, are made of 



drilling and laced up the back with tape run 
through small rings or eyelets. 

An Ironing Pad is a great convenience when 
ironing lace waists, embroidery, dresses, etc. Make 
one of a piece of an old blanket folded several 
times with two layers of cotton batting in the 
centre; quilt it in one or two-inch blocks; make 
cases for it from old sheets. It is invaluable for 
use in sleeves, shoulder seams, and for doing up 
embroidery pieces, especially raised work. 

To Remove Wrinkles — Let a wrinkled garment 
hang 24 hours, if possible, before dressing it. Many 
of the wrinkles will hang out. Taffeta is really 
injured by each pressing, and although taffeta does 
wrinkle easily, some of the wrinkles will come out 
if the garment is smoothed and carefully hung 
away. After each pressing, too, taffeta is just so 
much more liable to \vrinkle. 

When Chiffon is badly wrinkled, steam it, then 
hang it on a padded hanger. Stuff it with tissue 
paper, and dry it in front of fire or radiator. To 
steam it fill a big pan full of boiling water and hold 
the chiffon over it until it is damp with steam. 

Baby Irons — A set of toy irons is very useful for 
ironing baby clothes, or for yokes, sleeves and 
other dainty work. 

Rusty Irons To remove rust from flatirons, 

saturate a piece of flannel with ammonia, then rub 
the irons. Dry \vith a cloth sprinkled ■with pow- 
dered bath brick. 

Rusty irons can be made beautifully smooth by 
rubbing them when hot upon a piece of beeswax 
tied in a cloth and then upon a cloth sprinkled with 
salt. 

Rub flatirons over waxed paper before setting 
them away and they ^vill keep bright and smooth. 

Sticky Irons Irons that have been put away 

sticky should be well scraped with a thin knife, 
then rubbed with a rough cloth, moistened in kero- 
sene. 

If a Brick Is Used for an iron-stand the iron will 
hold its heat much longer than when an ordinary 
stand is used. 

Used Starch — It is economical after using a bowl 
of old starch to let it settle. Then pour off the 
water and dry the starch in the oven at night. It 
will be reduced to a cake and can be used again. 

Water in which macaroni has been cooked will 
make an excellent starch for use for dainty lingerie 
garments or fine ginghams.

ALL KINDS OF STAINS 

First Aid — It is hardly necessary to say that stains should be treated as 
speedily as possible after their first appearance. When once dry they are more 
difficult to remove, requiring both time and perseverance. 

Paint should be instantly wiped off. Grease on wood, stone or carpet 
should be congealed before it has time to penetrate, by throwing cold water over 
it. Tea, coffee, ink, wine and fruit stains will disappear in a quarter of the time if 
they can be attended to while wet. Spots on colored material must not be rubbed 
but dabbed over and over again until they disappear. Rubbing roughens the sur- 
face and often leaves a whitened circle almost as unsightly as the actual stain. Tlie 
dabbing is best done by covering a finger with an old handkerchief frequently 
changed, and great care should be taken to confine the operation to the area of the 
stain itself, and not to extend the damage by dampening and dabbing the sur- 
rounding material. In the treatment of stains, to know what you mean to do, and 
to do it quietly and neatly, is more than half the battle. 

In General — When any greasy substance has been dropped upon silk, it can be 
abstracted by mixing French chalk with methylated spirit to the consistency of cream, lay- 
ing it upon the stain, then covering with a brown paper and pressing with a warm iron. 
An ice cream mark can be removed by this means, but it must be applied at once. 

A bottle of cologne is a most useful article, for it will take away smears if rubbed 
on as soon as they appear, and it does not leave the disagreeable odor which remains for 
a time after using alcohol, benzine, and the like. Cologne may be used alike on white or 
colored fabrics, cotton or woolen, without the slightest injury. It is not intended for a gen- 
eral cleansing agent, as it is expensive for the purpose, but it is an emergency agent of about 
the same excellent value as others. For instance, when a person is quite ready to go out 
and detects some soil that has been overlooked when putting the garment, that is to be 
worn, away, a cloth saturated with cologne will remedy the spot at least temporarily, and 
leave a pleasant odor instead of the reverse. 

Medicine stains may often be removed by sponging thoroughly with alcohol. 

For acids, tie up a bit of washing soda in the stained part, make a lather of soap 
and cold soft water, immerse the linen and boil until the spot disappears. 



CORNELL COURSE ON STAINS 



To Remove Stains (Cornell Reading Course) — 
The ordinary washing process is sufficient to get 
rid of most of the dirt in clothing, but certain 
stains may require special treatment in order to 
insure their complete removal. Some stains are in- 
soluble in water, or in soap and water, or they 
may be made so by the action of heat, and thus 
become permanently set during the washing. It 
is wise always to look over clothing for such 
stains and to remove them before the wash- 
ing begins. Such examination will often save time 
and wear and tear on the garments, even while 
it is possible to remove the stains in washing, as 
only the part of the garment most affected is then 
treated, and the removal of the stain does not in- 
volve severe treatment of the whole garment. 

The process of removing stains is fundamentally 
the same as that of removing other forms of dirt, 



that is, to find some substance in which the stain 
is soluble or which will aid in its mechanical re- 
moval. The chief solvents valuable in removing 
stains that resist ordinary washing processes are: 

SOLVENTS 

The following are inflammable and should be so 
marked: 

Turpentine; benzine, naptha, or gasoline; kero- 
sene; ether (also an anaesthetic); chloroform (also 
anaesthetic and a poison) ; alcohol. 

Others: Carbona; olive oil, lard, etc.; fuller's 
earth and French chalk; naptha soaps; water, both 
hot and cold; oxalic acid (a poison); javelle 
water; benzol; hydrogen peroxid; sunshine; am- 
monia: borax; salt; vinegar; lemon juice; hydro- 
chloric acid (a strong acid and very corrosive to 
fabrics and to flesh); ink eradicator; milk.

GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF STAIN REMOVAL 

(From U. S. Farmers' Bulletin No. 861) 

Prepared Under the Direction of 
, C. F. Langworthy, Chief, Office of Home Economics 

The removal of stains is a necessary feature of the laundering and general 
care of clothing and other household textiles. Most stains may be removed easily 
at home, provided reliable methods are known and a few simple precautions are 
taken. With some stains prompt home treatment is necessary in order to save the 
article in question from being ruined, and in most cases it is desirable, since all 
stains are removed more easily when fresh. 

Too much emphasis cannot be laid on the importance of applying the stain 
removers w^hile the stain is still fresh, for usually it is much more difficult to re- 
move an old stain than a fresh one. Changes in the character of the stain, brought 
about by drying, exposure to air, washing, ironing or in other ways, often make it 
necessary to use chemicals in removing old stains, whereas in many cases much 
simpler methods are successful if the strins are treated when fresh. 



NATURE OF STAINS 



The nature of a stain should be known, if pos- 
sible, before its removal is attempted, since this 
determines the treatment to be adopted. More- 
over, if an unsuitable stain remover is used, the 
stain may be "set" so that its removal becomes 
difficult or even impossible. For example, if hot 
w^ater, which easily removes most fresh fruit stains, 
is applied to stains containing protein, such as 
stains of milk, blood, eggs, or meat juice, it coagu- 
lates the albumin in the fibers of the cloth and 
makes it extremely difficult to remove. Similarly, 
soap, which aids in the removal of grease spots. 
sets many fruit stains. 

The kind of fabric upon which the stain occurs 
also should be known. The method of treatment 
adopted depends as much upon the nature, color, 
weave, finish, and w^eight of the fabric as upon the 
kind of stain. Cotton and linen are destroyed by 
strong acids and attacked to some extent even 
by weaker ones. Concentrated acids, therefore, 
should never be used in removing stains from these 
fabrics, and when dilute acids are used they should 
be neutralized afterwards with a suitable alkali or 
removed by thorough rinsing; otherw^ise the acid 
may become cencentrated on drying and destroy 
the fibers. Generally speaking, alkalis do not at- 
tack cotton or linen fabrics to the extent that acids 
do. However, long-continued or repeated expo- 
sure to alkalis, especially in hot solution, weakens 
the fibers. This fact is said to be due to a hydra- 
tion of the cellulose which constitutes the fibers. 
The damage to fabrics resulting from the careless 
use of strongly alkaline soaps, w^ashing pow^ders, 
washing soda, or lye, is well known to the house- 
keeper. 



Wool and silk, being more delicate than cotton 
and linen, require more careful treatment. The 
use of very hot water must be avoided, since it 
turns both wool and silk yellow, shrinks wool, and 
weakens silk and injures its finish. These ma- 
terials also will not stand much rubbing, as this 
felts together the wool fibers and results in a 
shrinkage or thickening of the material, while the 
silk fabrics, as a rule, are too delicate to stand 
much rubbing without breaking or separating the 
fibers. Both w^ool and silk are dissolved by strong 
alkalis and are injured even by washing soda or 
strongly alkaline soap. The only alkalis w^hich 
should be used in laundering or removing stains 
from w^ool and silk are the milder ones like borax 
or dilute solutions of ammonia. Acids, w^ith the 
exception of nitric which w^eakens and turns the 
fibers yellow, do not attack wool and silk readily. 

In general it is more difficult to remove stains 
from wool and silk than from cotton or linen. In 
removing stains from materials made from two 
or more kinds of fibers, such as silk and cotton 
mixtures, the effects of the stain removers upon 
all of the fibers should be considered. No chem- 
ical should be used which w^ould injure the most 
delicate of the fibers present. 

It is also much more difficult to remove stains 
from colored than from white materials, for the 
reason that most of the bleaching agents which 
must be used to remove persistent stains are likely 
to destroy the color of the material as well.

METHODS FOR TREATMENT OF STAINS IN GENERAL 



The following paragraphs deal with methods 
and reagents commonly used in the removal of a 
number of stains. To save repetition, these are 
given here in detail, and reference is made to them 
in dealing w^ith the particular stains in later pages 
of the bulletin. 

Laundering — Ordinary laundering, mentioned 
frequently as a method for removing stains, should 
be done as follows: First, soak the stained portion 
in cold or lukewarm w^ater, rubbing the stain with 
a neutral soap if necessary. Follow this by thor- 
ough rinsing in clean water, after w^hich the article 
may be laundered as usual. Use this method only 
for cotton and linen (white or fast colors) and the 
so-called wash silks and washable woolens. If the 
materials are delicate, sponge them. 

Sponging — Sponging is applicable to all fabrics, 
but especially to delicate materials or colors which 
ordinary laundering might injure. Spread the 
stained article on a flat surface in a good light, 
and beneath the stain put a cloth folded into sev- 
eral thicknesses, or clean, w^hite blotting paper, to 
absorb the superfluous liquid. Change the pad for 
a fresh one as soon as it becomes soiled. Sponge 
with a clean, soft lintless cloth (preferably of the 
same material as that stained) and renew^ it as fre- 
quently as may be necessary. Lay the stained 
material with the wrong side up and apply the 
w^ater to the back, so that the foreign substances 
can be washed from the fibers onto the pad without 
having to pass through the material. 

Application of Chemicals — Chemicals should not 
be used until w^ater or laundering has been tried, 
for they attack the fibers of the cloth as well as 
the stain. 

There are a few^ common chemicals which are 
necessary in removing some stains, and these 
should be kept in every household. A good plan 
is to have a small cupboard in the laundry where 
these chemicals may be kept together w^ith the 
utensils used in applying them. As some of these 
chemicals are poisonous they should not be kept 
in the family medicine cabinet or pantry. Chem- 
icals most commonly used in removing stains are 
Javelle water, potassium permanganate (solution), 
oxalic acid, ammonia water, carbon tetrachlorid, 
French chalk, and cream of tartar. 

With these chemicals should be kept some of the 
utensils used in applying them; such as a medium- 
sized bowl, a medicine dropper, a glass rod with 
rounded ends, several pads of cheesecloth or old 
muslin, and a small sponge. 

Other chemicals are mentioned in later pages of 
the bulletin. These can generally be bought as 
needed at any of the larger drug stores. 

If the effect of the stain remover upon the fiber 
or color is not known, try it by applying a little 



to a sample or to an unexposed portion of the 
goods. Sometimes it is best to remove the stain 
even if some of the color is removed also, for the 
color often may be restored by careful tinting. 

Work rapidly when using chemicals to remove 
stains, so as to give them as little time as possible 
to act on the textile fibers. Many brief applica- 
tions of the chemicals, with rinsing or neutraliza- 
tion after each application, are preferable to the 
practice of allowing them to remain on the stain 
for a long time. Stretch the stained portion of the 
garment over a bow^l of clean water and apply the 
chemical with a medicine dropper. The chemicals 
may be rinsed out quickly by dipping in the clean 
water. Another method is to place the stained 
portion over a pad of folded cloth and apply the 
chemical with a glass rod. The rinsing or neutrali- 
zing always must be thorough. 

Javelle Water — Prepare Javelle water as follows: 
Dissolve I pound of washing soda in I quart of 
cold water To this solution add Ya pound of or- 
dinary bleaching powder (calcium hypochlorite). 
Filter this liquid through a piece of muslin to re- 
move the sediment which remains. Keep the clear 
liquid in tightly stoppered bottles for use. Javelle 
water may be used successfully in removing a num- 
ber of stains, but should be applied only to un- 
colored cotton or linen materials, since it bleaches 
colors and rots silk or wool. In treating stains 
with Javelle water, stretch the stained portion over 
a bowl filled with water and apply the Javelle water 
to the stain with a medicine dropper. Do not allow 
the Javelle water to remain in contact with the 
stain for more than one minute, and then apply 
oxalic-acid solution to neutralize the Javelle water 
and rinse by dipping the stain in the bowl of 
water. 

Commercial ink removers are similar in action 
to Javelle water, and are very convenient for re- 
moving many stains beside ink spots. 

If allowed to remain too long in contact with the 
fibers Javelle water rots even linen and cotton ma- 
terials, and it should, therefore, always be neutral- 
ized with oxalic acid and the fabric be rinsed thor- 
oughly to remove all traces of the chemical. Sev- 
eral applications of the Javelle water with inter- 
mediate neutralizations are necessary with persis- 
tent stains. 

Potassium Permanganate — Potassium perman- 
ganate can be used in removing stains from all 
white fabrics. It also may be used successfully 
upon many colored materials, but should always 
be tried first on an unexposed portion of the goods, 
to determine its effect on the dye. It does not 
harm delicate fibers, provided it is used with rea- 
sonable care. First, remove as much of the stain 
as possible by sponging or washing with 
cold water. Prepare and use the perman- 



366 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Section VI— LAUNDRY. IRONING BOARD 



ganate as follows: Dissolve I teaspoonful of the 
crystals in a pint of water and apply a little of this 
to the stain with a medicine dropper, a glass rod, 
or a clean cork, and allow it to remain for about 
five minutes. Remove any pink or brown stain left 
by the permanganate, by applying one of the fol- 
lowing chemicals: 

1. Hydrogen peroxid, made slightly acid (if not 
already so) with hydrochloric, acetic, oxalic, or 
tartaric acid. One drop of the acid usually is 
enough to acidify 3 teaspoonfuls of the peroxid. 

2. Oxalic acid in saturated solution or lemon 
juice for cotton, linen, or silk. Hydrogen peroxid 
is more satisfactory for wool. 

Follow the treatment by thorough rinsing. 
One or more repetitions of this treatment may 
be necessary in the case of persistent stains. 

Oxalic Acid — ^This is poisonous and should be 
used carefully; the bottle in which it is kept must 
be marked "Poison," and kept out of the reach of 
children. 



To prepare a solution of oxalic acid for use, dis- 
solve as many of the crystals of the acid as will 
dissolve in a pint of lukewarm water. Put into a 
bottle, stopper tightly, and use as needed. Apply 
this solution to the stain with a medicine dropper 
or glass rod. and after allowing it to remain for a 
few minutes rinse thoroughly in clean water. 

Hydrogen Peroxid — Hydrogen peroxid. as ob- 
tained for medicinal purposes, usually is made 
slightly acid, to give it better keeping quality. For 
use in removing stains make a small amount of the 
peroxid slightly alkaline with ammonia. It then 
decomposes easily and its oxygen is free to attack 
the stain. Since hydrogen peroxid affects the fiber 
also, in the case of cotton and linen materials, fol- 
low it by very careful rinsing. Apply it to the 
stain with a medicine dropper, a glass rod, or a 
clean cork, or sponge the stain with it. The 
method of using it in neutralizing potassium 
permanganate is described above. 



METHODS FOR INDIVIDUAL STAINS 



In cases where the nature of the stain is not 
known it should be attacked first by sponging with 
cold water, provided, however, that the fabric 
would not be injured by water. If the stain is not 
removed by cold or warm water, chemicals should 
then be applied. Often the behavior of a stain, 
when treated with cold water, will give some indi- 
cation of its nature; for example, a grease spot will 
not absorb water. Hot water should be avoided in 
treating unknown stains until after other sub- 
stances have been tried, since hot water will set 
many stains and n\ake their removal more difficult. 

Acids With the exception of nitric acid, acids 

do not generally produce stains upon white fabrics 
but often change or destroy the color of dyed ma- 
terials. However, vegetable fibers are destroyed 
readily by some acids, especially by those of greater 
concentration or strength. Strong sulphuric acid, 
by virtue of its drying action, readily destroys the 
fibers of cotton and linen, which consist chiefly of 
cellulose; but not those of wool and silk, which do 
not contain cellulose. Strong nitric acid or the 
dilute acid, if allowed to become concentrated by 
drying not only turns the fibers of silk and wool 
to a permanent bright yellow, but finally dissolves 
them. Dilute acids do not attack the fibers to any 
great extent unless they are allowed to dry on the 
cloth and become concentrated, but they do some- 
times affect the color of the fibers. It is essential, 
therefore, that acid spots on textiles be neutralized 
at once by some alkaline solution. For this pur- 
pose anyone of the following should give good 
results: 

I. Water. Rinse the spot several times in a 
large volume of water. This treatment serves to 



stop any further action of the acid on the fabric, 
but usually has no effect upon any discoloration 
due to the acid. 

2. An alkaline substance. Apply an alkali to 
the acid spot. The alkali forms a salt with the acid 
and this must be removed later by rinsing or 
sponging with water. The acid should be neutral- 
ized completely with the alkali or the discoloration 
may reappear after awhile. To determine when an 
acid is completely neutralized touch it with a piece 
of litmus paper, wet in clean water. Litmus paper 
is red in the presence of acids and blue with alkalis. 
It may be purchased at some drug stores, but if 
litmus paper is not available it is possible to tell 
\vhen an acid spot is neutralized by tasting it. If 
alkaline it will taste bitter and if acid it will taste 
sour. Any of the following alkalis may be used. 

(a) Ammonia. If the spot is slight, neutralize 
it by holding it in the fumes from an open bottle 
of strong ammonia. 

(b) Sodium bicarbonate (baking soda). Sprinkle 
this on the stain — on both sides, if possible — 
moisten with water, and allow to stand until the 
acid is neutralized (shown in this case by the ceas- 
ing of the effervescence) ; and remove the excess 
by rinsing with ^vater. 

(c) Ammonium carbonate (sal volatile). Apply 
in the same way as sodium bicarbonate. 

Alkalis — Dilute alkalis have little effect on cotton 
and linen, but strong alkalis cause the fibers to 
swell and become yellow, and the cloth to contract. 
The fiber, however, is not weakened unless the 
alkali is allowed to remain a long time upon the 
cloth or to become very concentrated through 
evaporation. Wool and silk, on the other hand. 



LAUNDRY, IRONING BOARD— STAINS— REMOVAL

are yellowed or destroyed by strong alkalis even in 
dilute solutions. Even if the fiber is not affected 
by the alkali, the color may be changed or de- 
stroyed. It is important, therefore, to neutralize 
alkali spots at once. Use any of the following 
agents; 

1 . Water. Rinse thoroughly. Frequently this 
is sufficient in the case of such alkalis as washing 
soda and ammonia. 

2. A mild acid. Apply the acid with a cloth 
until the fabric changes back to its original color, 
or until the stain is slightly acid as shov^n by its 
reaction to litmus paper or by the odor or taste. 
Then rinse the fabric thoroughly in water. In the 
case of colored goods it is helpful to rub the stain 



dry, using a piece of the same material as the 
stained fabric, if possible. Use any of the follow- 
ing mild acids: 

(a) Lemon juice. Squeeze the juice on the 
stain. As long as the spot remains alkaline the 
juice is a bright yellow in color, but when the spot 
becomes acid the color disappears almost entirely. 
Apply the lemon juice until this color change takes 
place. 

(b) Vinegar. If the vinegar itself leaves a spot, 
remove it by sponging with water. 

(c) Acetic acid. Apply a 10 per cent, solution 
to the stain and remove the excess by rinsing.

NOTE: The majority of the following items are taken from Cornell Reading 
Course, Farm House Series No. 3, "The Laundry," to which the publishers acknowledge 
their grateful indebtedness. Such Cornell items are in each case marked "(C. R. C. )." 



Blood — (C. R. C.) — Wash in cold water until 
stain turns brown, then rub with naptha soap and 
soak in warm water. Or; rub with common soap, 
then soak in water to which a teaspoon of turpen- 
tine has been added. Or; if the goods is thick 
apply a paste of raw starch to the stain; renew 
paste from time to time until stain disappears. 

Blood — If fresh, blood may be removed by soak- 
ing for twelve hours in cold water and starch; or 
by soaking in cold water, then washing in warm 
water with plenty of soap; expose to the sun a day 
or two if any stain remains. Old blood stains re- 
quire iodine of potassium diluted with four times 
its weight of water. 

Chocolate — (C. R. C.) — Sprinkle with borax 
and soak in cold water. 

Chocolate and Coffee Pour soft boiling water 

through the stains and while wet hold in the fumes 
of burning sulphur. Or soak overnight in cold 
water in which a little borax has been dissolved. 
Or use glycerine in same manner as for tea stains 
(see TEA), especially when cream had been in 
the coffee or the chocolate. 

Coffee (C. R. C.) Spread stained surface of 

the cloth over bowl or tub. Pour boiling water 
through the stained part of the cloth; pour from a 
height so as to strike the stain vrith force. 

Cream — (C. R. C.) — Wash in cold water, then 
with soap and water. 

Fruit and Wine — (C. R. C.) — Treat with boiling 
water as for coffee. If the stain resists the 
boiling water treatment, soak the stained part 
of the cloth for a few minutes in a solution made 
from equal parts of javelle water and boiling water. 
Rinse thoroughly with boiling water to which a 
little dilute ammonia water has been added. Re- 
peat if necessary. 



Fruit and Wine While fresh, gently rub the 

spot with a clean cloth saturated with alcohol; if 
cloth remains on the table, protect the table from 
the alcohol. If old, rub fruit stains with yellow 
soap on both sides of the cloth, cover quickly with 
cold water starch well rubbed in, and expose to 
sun and air for three or four days. Then rub off 
the mixture. Repeat process if necessary. Apple 
and pear stains may be removed by soaking in 
paraffin for a few hours before washing. Fruit 
spots may often be removed by pouring boiling 
water through the stain while fresh. Old fixed 
stains may be removed by soaking in a weak solu- 
tion of oxalic acid, or holding the spot over the 
fumes of sulphur. 

Egg — Egg stains should be soaked in cold water; 
hot water would set the stains. The same rule 
applies to egg stains on dishes; wash in cold water 
instead of hot water and they come off more read- 

ily. 

Grass Stains — (C. R. C.) — Soak in alcohol. Or; 
Wash with naptha soap and warm water. If the 
fabric has no delicate colors and the stain is fresh, 
treat with ammonia water. For colored fabrics, 
apply molasses or a paste of soap and cooking 
soda and let stand over night. 

Crease Spots (C. R. C.) — wash thoroughly with 

naptha soap and water. Soften old grease spots 
with turpentine, oil, or lard, before washing the 
cloth. Or; dissolve the grease in benzine, alcohol, 
chloroform, ether, carbona, or benzol. For deli- 
cate fabrics dissolve grease spots in ether or chloro- 
form. Chloroform and carbona are useful because 
non-inflammable. Or; apply a paste of Fuller's 
earth or chalk to absorb grease, especially when 
fresh. 



368 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Section VI— LAUNDRY. IRONING BOARD 



Grease Hot water and soap will usually remove 

these; if of long standing use chloroform or naptha 
(away from artificial open flame light). Eucalyp- 
tus oil (used for mosquito lotion, but not always 
unadulterated for this purpose) will remove grease 
spots without injury to any material. 

Indigo (C. R. C.) — Treat as for coffee (C. R. 

C). 

Ink — (C. R. C.) — Ink is often aifficult to re- 
move, as it varies greatly in composition. It is 
well to experiment with a corner of the spot (or 
with some of the same ink on another fabric) be- 
fore operating on the whole. 

If the stain is fresh* soak the stained portion of 
the cloth in milk. Use fresh milk as the old be- 
comes discolored. Or; wet the stain with cold 
water. Apply a ten per cent, solution of oxalic 
acid to stain, let stand a few minutes, and rinse. 
Repeat until stain disappears. Rinse in water to 
which borax or ammonia has been added. (Oxalic 
acid is a very poisonous substance). Javelle w^ater 
will remove some ink stains. Apply as for rust 
stains (see RUST (C. R. C). Or; treat with 
hydrochloric acid as for iron rust (C. R. C). Or; 
treat with lemon juice and salt, as for iron rust 
(C. R. C), Or; use alcohol for some ink stains. 

Milk is the only reagent given above that does 
not remove color. 

Ink — (Iowa State College) — I, If stain is fresh, 
place stained portion in sweet or sour milk and 
allow to stand several hours. 2. Wet stain in cold 
water and drop dilute oxalic acid or equal parts 
oxalic acid and cream of tartar on the spot, let 
stand a few minutes and rinse in ammonia water. 
3. If stain is dry and w^ell set, cover w^ith salt and 
lemon juice, or use Javelle w^ater. 4. Soak stain in 
hot vinegar. 5. Ink eradicator may be used. The 
result depends upon w^eave and material, also kind 
of ink. 

To bleach or remove stains from white goods, 
soak the article in equal quantities Javelle w^ater 
and hot water until stains disappear; then rinse 
thoroughly in several waters, and finally in diluted 
ammonia w^ater. 

Javelle water removes all stains and all colors, 
and therefore should not be used on colored goods. 

Ink — Ink can generally be removed in the same 
manner as rust. Oxalic acid and Javelle w^ater 
will remove ink, but all ink removers except milk 
will also remove color from colored fabrics. Soak 
in sour milk; if a stain remains and the fabric is 
not a colored fabric; rinse in a ^veak solution of 
chlorid of lime, or try other reagents. To take 
ink spots out of colored materials cover with tal- 
low^ before sending to the laundry and much if not 
all of the stain w^ill disappear. Boiling starch 
poured over ink spots will often remove ink spots, 
but requires treatment for an hour or two; it is 
not injurious to colored materials. Salts of lemon 
w^ill remove ink spots in many cases; wet the 



pow^der, then wet the spot with tepid wfeiter; then 
rub on a little of the salts and expose to the sun. 
Use of milk: wash out as much of the spot as pos- 
sible in milk; put finally to soak in a pan of milk, 
let it stand two days, or until the milk turns to 
clabber; then wash out the fabric. 

Indellible Ink — Cyanide of potassium (one of 
the most violent of poisons) will remove all in- 
dellible inks, the base of which is nitrate of silver. 
Turpentine or alcohol rubbed in hot removes the 
new inks, using soda and soap freely in hot w^ater 
afterw^ards. 

Iodine — (C. R. C.) — Soak in alcohol, chloro- 
form or ether. 

Iodine — Iodine may be removed from skin or 
clothing with strong ammonia water. Or use boil- 
ing starch water same as for ink stains. Or wash 
with alcohol, then rinse with soapy water. 

Iron Rust — (C, R. C.) — I. Wet the stained part 
with borax and w^ater, or ammonia, and spread 
over a bowl of boiling water. Aply a ten per 
cent, solution of hydrochloric acid, drop by drop, 
until the stain begins to brighten. Dip at once 
into alkiline water. If the stain does not at once 
disappear add more acid and rinse again. After 
the stain is removed, rinse at once thoroughly in 
w^ater to which borax or ammonia has been added, 
to neutralize any acid that may linger. Less dilute 
acid may be used if the operator is skillful. 

2. Proceed as with hydrochloric acid, but use 
a ten per cent, solution of oxalic acid instead of 
hydrochloric acid. Oxalic acid is not so detri- 
mental to fabrics as is hydrochloric acid, but it is 
a deadly poison even in dilute solution. 

3. Wet the stained part with a paste made of 
lemon juice, salt, starch and soap, and expose it 
to the sunlight. This is a simple method to em- 
ploy, but it takes longer and is often not effective. 

4. Soak stain in Javelle water for a few min- 
utes, then wash. Repeat until stain disappears. 
Javelle %vater is w^eaker in action than is hydro- 
chloric acid. All the iron-rust-removing substances 
destroy color, and unless care is taken will greatly 
weaken the fabric. 



Lampblack — (C. R. C.) Saturate spot with 

kerosene. Wash with naphtha soap and water. 

Lampblack or Soot — Rub the spots with d ry 
corn meal before sending the clothes to the laun- 
dry. 

Machine Oil — (C. R. C.) — Wash with soap and 
cold w^ater. If the stain does not respond to 
the soap and water, use turpentine as directed 
(C. R. C.) for paint stains. 

Machine Oil — Try rubbing with lard, let stand, 
w^ash with cold water and soap. 

Meat Juice (C. R. C.) — Wash in cold water, 

then with soap and water.

Medicine Stains — (C. R. C.) — Soak in alcohol. 

Mildew — (C. R. C.) — Mildew is very difficult to 
remove if of long standing. I. Wet stains with 
lemon juice and expose to the sun. 2. Wet with 
paste made of I tablespoonful of starch, juice of 
I lemon, soft soap, and salt, and expose to action 
of sun. 3. Treat with paste made of powdered 
chaik and expose to action of sun. 

Mildew — Mildew may often be removed with 
chlorid of lime; soak several hours, then rinse in 
cold water. Or try saturating the article with kero- 
sene, roll it up and let stand 24 hours, then wash 
in soapsuds. A mixture of soapy starch and milk 
will often prove sufficient for fresh mildew. 

Milk — (C. R. C.) — ^Treat as directed under 
cream. 

Mucus — (C. R. C.) — Soak in ammonia water or 
in salt and water, then wash \vith soap and cold 
water. 

Mud Spots — Mud spots which are left after the 
garment has been brushed may be removed by rub- 
bing with a cut raw potato. 

Paint — (C. R. C.) — I. Wet the spot with turpen- 
tine, benzine or alcohol, let it stand a few minutes. 
Wet again and sponge or pat with a clean cloth. 
Continue until stain disappears. 2. For delicate 
colors, treat with chloroform. 3. If the paint is 
old it may take some time to soften. Treat old 
paint stains with equal parts of ammonia and tur- 
pentine. 

Paint If a fine fabric is involved, use alcohol 

or chloroform instead of turpentine. If turpen- 
tine, when used, leaves a dark ring or spot, sponge 
with chloroform. 

Perspiration (C. R. C.) — Wash in soapsuds and 

expose to the action of sunshine. Or treat with 
Javelle water as directed for iron rust. Or treat 
with oxalic acid as directed for iron rust. 

Scorch — (C. R. C.) — Scorched fabric can be re- 
stored if the threads are uninjured. I. Wet the 
stained portion and expose to the action of the 
sun. Repeat several times. 2. Extract juice of 2 
onions, add 1 cupful vinegar, 2 ounces Fuller's 



earth, and Yl ounce of soap. Boil. Spread paste 
over scorched surface. Let it dry in sun. Wash 
out thoroughly. 

Scorch — Rub the spot with a cloth dipped in 
diluted peroxide of hydrogen; place the garment in 
the hottest sun possible. Or a soap rub, then the 
sun bath, may be sufficient. 

Soot — Treat as directed for lampblack. 

Stove Polish — (C. R. C.) — If fresh, remove by 
washing. If the stain is old, treat as directed for 
tar and lampblack. 

Tar (C. R. C.) — Treat as directed for lamp- 
black. 

Tar or Pitch (or Wheel Crease) Soften stains 

%vith lard, then soak in turpentine and rub gently 
until dry. Make a ring around the stained part, of 
cornstarch, so the turpentine will not spread. 

Tea — (C. R. C.) — Treat as directed for choco- 
late. Or soak the stain in glycerin, then wash. 

Tea Soak the stained part in cold water, then 

in glycerin, let it stand an hour or two, then wash 
with cold water and rub well. Even the old stains 
will disappear under this treatment. Directly tea 
is spilt on a table cloth or napkin, cover the stain 
with common salt. Leave it for awhile; when the 
cloth is then washed the stain will have disap- 
peared. Clear boiling water poured through tea 
stains, as directed for removing coffee stains, will 
effect removal. 

Tea stains on Granite Ware or enamel teapot — 
Fill with cold or leftover coffee and boiling water 
and set on stove to boil for ten minutes; remove 
the coffee and wash pot in hot soapy water. 

Varnish — (C. R. C.) — Treat as directed for 
paint. 

Vaseline (C. R. C.) Wash with turpentine. 

Boiling sets this stain. 

Vaseline Saturate the spot with ether and lay 

a cup over it to prevent evaporation until the stain 
is removed. Use the ether with very great care; 
it is volatile and dangerous. 

Wine Treat as directed for fruit stains. 

Wagon Grease (C. R. C.) — Soften with lard or 

oil and wash in soap and water.

"In time 
of health 
prepare 
for 
sickness" 



THE HOME NURSE 

In spite of all the barriers it is possible to devise, sickness and accident cannot 
always be kept from the home. And the physicians fight is half won if those 
in the home support his work with intelligence, assurance and quiet efficiency, 
while his function is often rendered unnecessary, and always it is a big aid to him, 
if "what to do first" or while awaiting him, is known and sensibly practiced. 

To the gentle hand of the woman belongs the care of the sick, and every 
woman should appreciate seriously that the time will come inevitably \vhen on her 
will perhaps depend even the life of a loved one. This is not to say that she 
should fit herself as a professional nurse is fitted, but that "reasonable prepared- 
ness" should be hers in that she should learn the simple lessons imperatively nec- 
essary for the care of the sick, or the meeting of an emergency in her own home. 

No course in home nursing can equip one to take care of such critical issues as typhoid 
fever or pneumonia, but even in these knowledge and confidence, and the quiet assurance 
that comes of intelligence, will materially assist the professional nurse engaged, and help 
her to establish the proper atmosphere and carry on her own work with infinitely greater 
ease and success. But for the ordinary home ills, learn the following first principles of 
home nursing. 

The day of the long face is past and gone. Cheerfulness, hopefulness, confidence, 
give the patient the feeling that in the very atmosphere is the sense of winning as a mat- 
ter of course. 

Sunlight, air and quiet, come next. Turn out any member of the family necessary to 
attain these for the sick. Sun and fresh air are the best cleansers and stimulants that 
exist. They purify polluted atmosphere, real and mental, better than any disinfectant or 
tonic known. Quiet clears away worry and irritation, small excitements and all sorts of 
nervous rubbish — and even pleasant excitements, including the entertaining of visitors, are 
included here.

HOME NURSING 

(Iowa State College Bulletin) 
L VALUE OF KNOWLEDGE 

A working knowledge of the fundamental principles of home nursing gives 
power to interpret the directions of the physician and also puts the home maker in 
perfect sympathy with his directions. This spirit of cooperation removes a serious 
handicap which often prevents the physician from doing his best work. 

Serious illness is frequently avoided by timely preventive treatment w^hich is 
the result of this knowledge of principles. 

A knowledge of the fundamental principles of nursing is essential in the wise 
treatment of emergencies. 

11. QUAUFICATIONS OF A NURSE 

The qualifications of the successful nurse are identical with the qualifications 
of the ideal woman. The chief qualifications are neatness, good temper, poise, 
tact, which is another name for common sense, and good health. 

The ability to adapt herself to all circumstances is a valuable asset. 

Neatness means clean person, simply combed hair, well shod feet, clean, sim- 
ply made, cotton dresses, clean teeth, clean hands and clean finger nails. 

Good health is so essential to the home nurse, that great care must be taken 
to maintain good physical condition. It is especially important that the home 
nurse eat simple, easily digested food at regular intervals, that she spend some time 
in the open air each day and that she plan for some sleeping hours out of each 
twenty-four. The v^elfare of the patient depends upon this. 

in. THE SICK ROOM 

A large room on the sunny side of the house is preferable. A room with two 
or more wndows makes thorough ventilation more easily possible. A germ dis- 
ease should be cared for on the upper floor, to aid in preventing the contamina- 
tion of the lower floor. The room should have only a minimum amount of fur- 
niture. A painted or other hard finished w^all is preferable. Upholstered furni- 
ture, thick rugs and other dust catchers should be avoided. Windows should be 
securely screened. The bed should be so located as to protect eyes from strong 
light, and patient from direct draught. 

IV. KNOWLEDGE OF BACTERIA 

Bacteria are present practically everywhere in nature. They are found in the 
air, in the soil, in salt and fresh ■water, in the food. 

The majority of bacteria, however, are harmless and many of them are bene- 
ficial. Under the latter may be named the putrefiers, nitrifiers and flavor produc- 
ers. Bacteria, which produce disease, are known as pathogenic bacteria. 

Methods of Destroying Bacteria B. Chemical agents. 

A. Physical agents. '■ ^^ «^'"- 

1. Heat. 2- By '•''"■'^'- 

3. By soluble salts. 

Chemical agents which will destroy bacteria are 

By steaming. known as disinfectants, while those that check 

By use of hot air or dry sterilization. the growth of bacteria are known as antiseptics. 



FAMILY DOCTOR, HEALTH— HOME NURSING

DISINFECTANTS 

1. Bichloride of Mercury (corrosive sublimate): 
Standard solution, 1:1000 (I tablet to a pint of 
water). 

Thia is particularly serviceable for the disinfec- 
tion of wounds, the hands, and for washing wood- 
work, floors and furniture. 

Bichloride will discolor clothing and corrode 
metal, marble and porcelain, hence it is inapplic- 
able for the disinfection of instruments and for use 
in plumbing fixtures. 

2. Carbolic Acid or Phenol: A 3 per cent solu- 
tion will destroy non-spore bearing microorganisms 
very quickly. To insure the killing of bacterial 
spores add 0.5 per cent of hydrochloric acid. 

Carbolic acid will not discolor white materials or 
metals. It is one of the most common and most 
valuable of the disinfectants for handkerchiefs, 
towels, underclothing, napkins, etc. 

3. Lysol, Cresol and Creolin: These are very 
closely related to carbolic acid or phenol and are 
used similarly. 

4. Chloride of Lime: Dissolve chloride of lime 
of the best quality in pure water in the proportion 
of six ounces to the gallon. Keep in a stone jar 
or jug. Use one quart of thia solution for each 
discharge from patient suffering with a contagious 
or infectious disease. Chloride of lime is used 
principally for disinfecting excreta, water closets, 
sinks and traps. 

5. Milk of Lime: Milk of lime is made by adding 
one part of dry freshly slacked lime to four parta 
of water. 

To disinfect excreta use twice as much of the 
milk of lime as the volume of the discharge. 
Thorough mixing and stirring are advisable. The 
mixture should stand one hour before being thrown 
into the water closet or before being buried. A 
5 per cent solution of carbolic acid may be used 
instead of the milk of lime. 

6. Formaldehyde: Formaldehyde is a gas readily 
soluble in ^vater. It is commonly sold as formalin 
(a 40 per cent solution of formaldehyde in water). 
Formaldehyde is more commonly used for fumiga- 
tion than any other gas. It does not damage 
books, paintings, delicate fabrics, or attack ordin- 
ary dyes or metals. 

It can therefore be used for the disinfection of 
furnished rooms, sleeping cars, ambulances and 
closed vehicles. Formaldehyde is active only in 
the presence of moisture. The air of the room 
during fumigation should contain 75 per cent of 
moisture and the temperature of the room should 
be at least 50 degrees F. 

7. Alcohol: Alcohol of 70 per cent solution is 
frequently used as a disinfectant for thermometers, 
needles and to disinfect the skin. 



ANTISEPTICS 

1. Peroxide of Hydrogen: Peroxide of hydrogen 
will check bacterial growth. It is used on wounds, 
as a mouth wash and as a gargle. 

2. Listerine: Listerine is one of the common 
antiseptics used as a mouth wash and gargle. 

3. Boric Acid: Boric acid solution is made by 
dissolving the powder in hot water (a 4 per cent 
solution is usually uaed). It is used for eye and 
nasal applications and for mouth washes and for 
a cut or an abrasion of the skin, or a discharging 
sore. It is also used to sterilize thermometers and 
rubber nipples. 

4. Salt Solution: Use one level teaspoonful of 
salt to one pint of sterilized water. This possesses 
but slight antiseptic properties but it is much used 
on account of its atimulating effect on tissue. 

5. Condys Fluid: Condys fluid conains 16 grains 
of permanganate of potash crystals to one ounce 
of water. It is both a disinfectant and deodorant. 

VENTILATION 

"A constant supply of pure, fresh, flowing air" 
is essential to health. An adult requires 1,200 cubic 
feet of pure air every hour for breathing. Ventila- 
tion must be carried on continually day and night. 

Methods of Ventilation 

1. Gravity and Diffusion (natural means). 

2. Mechanical Ventilation (by propulsion or 
extraction of air). The air of the sick room must 
be kept pure, wholesome and cool. In almost every 
case the window can be kept open I Yl inches from 
the top without injury to the patient. The hot air 
rises and displaces the cold air. The sick room 
may be properly ventilated by arrangement of win- 
dows in adjoining rooms. A good circulation 
without a draught may be secured. A fire place 
is one of the very best ventilators. The tempera- 
ture of the sick room should be from 65 to 68 
degrees F. at night and 68 to 70 degrees F. in the 
daytime. 

CLEANLINESS 

The Floor: Remove rugs from room, sweep 
clean and wipe rugs with dampened cloth wrung 
out of hot water which has a few drops of for- 
maldehyde in it. 

Note: Great care must be taken in handling 
formaldehyde. The gas is a great irritant to eyes, 
nose and throat. 

If the case is a contagious disease, remove from 
room all rugs except one which can be easily fu- 
migated or if necessary, burned. 

Sweep the floor with a vacuum cleaner or with 
a brush or broom covered with a dampened cloth. 
Avoid disseminating the dust about the room in 
every possible way. Clean the floor thoroughly 
with soap and hot >vater and follow with a standard 

solution of bichloride of mercury 1:1000 parts 

— (I tablet to 1 pint of water). 



374 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Sec. VII— FAMILY DOCTOR, HEALTH 



The Furniture: Metallic or non-absorbent sub- 
stances are the ideal materials for beds in the sick 
room. These can be wiped with a disinfectant or 
antiseptic wash so that all cracks or crevices will 
be free of dust or germs. The remainder of the 
furniture should be thoroughly dusted every day 
with a dampened cloth even if the furniture is 
varnished or oiled. This can be done without 
injury to the furniture if it is rubbed immediately 



with a dry cloth. Once a week apply to the fur- 
niture a mixture of equal parts of oil and turpen- 
tine. Apply the emulsion sparingly and rub after- 
wards till all greasiness has disappeared. This 
will keep the furniture in good condition. The 
sick room should be thoroughly free from dust and 
should have a clean sweet odor about it. The 
use of deodorizers is questionable. The source of 
the odor should be removed. 



V. CARE OF PATIENT 
Bed and Clothing 

The three-quarter bed is a convenient size. The mattress should not be too 
hard and should have a perfectly level surface. The springs should be only mod- 
erately elastic and should present a level surface. When a protecting sheet is nec- 
essary, a rubber sheet or an oil cloth protecting sheet is preferable. In the absence 
of these, new^spapers may be used. They should be removed frequently and burned. 
Sheets should be at least 2^^ yards in length (this is required by an Iowa state 
law for public beds). Pillows should be of medium size. Blankets are lighter and 
more easily cleaned than quilts. 



Making the Bed 

Tuck in under sheet securely at head, foot and 
sides, being careful to make the fold under the 
mattress much deeper at the head than at the 
foot. This helps to keep a smooth surface under 
the shoulders and is a means of preventing irrita- 
tion of the skin. Place the protecting sheet of 
rubber, oilcloth or paper over the undersheet, be- 
ing careful to place it under the trunk of the body. 
Over this place the draw sheet, being careful to 
place the folded edge toward the head. Place the 
upper sheet with the wide hem toward the head. 
Fold the top of sheet over sufficiently to cover the 
edge of blanket (about 12 inches). Place blanket 
and spread over top sheet, folding top sheet over 
edge of blanket and spread. Tuck clothes in se- 
curely at the foot. Begin at lower right corner 
of bed. Lift upper sheet, blanket and spread in a 
diagonal fold from lower right corner of bed to 
edge of clothes. Tuck in bedding below fold, until 
the diagonal fold hangs smoothly. This holds the 
bedding securely at the foot and does not hold too 
firmly at the sides. 

Changing the Bed Clothing 

Have freshly aired and warmed bedding ready 
for use. Remove spread and fold neatly. Fold 
fresh draw sheet. Fold fresh under sheet in long 
fan-like folds. 

Roll patient as far toward the opposite edge of 
the bed as possible. Loosen bedding all around 
edge of the bed. Push soiled under sheets, one at 
a time, close to the back of the patient, keeping 
them in long straight folds. 

Place clean under sheets in position. Roll pa- 
tient to clean side of bed. Remove soiled under 
sheets, draw the clean ones over and secure under 



the mattress. Spread the fresh upper sheet and 
blanket over those already on the bed and draw 
out the soiled ones from the foot of the bed. Re- 
place spread and fold bedding at lower corner* 
with the diagonal fold as at first. Remove pillow 
and replace it by a freshly aired pillow with clean 
slip. Remove soiled clothing from the room. 

Note: In case of contagious diseases, the soiled 
bedding should be placed upon paper and should 
be carried out at once for disinfection. (Process 
is described under disinfectants.) In case of di- 
seases like scarlet fever which enter the body 
through the air passages, the bedding should be 
thoroughly fumigated before being hung outside 
to air. For all bedding which can be boiled, boil- 
ing one hour is an effective means of disinfection. 



SPONGE BATH IN BED 
Equipment — Hot water, cold water, bowl 



of 



warm water (98 degrees), mild soap, bath towel, 
face to^vel, wash clothes, mouth wash. 

Method 

Put patient between light weight blankets and 
remove clothing without exposing the patient. 
Wash and dry face and neck. Wash and dry arms, 
chest, abdomen, limbs and back. 

Precautions 

Rub firmly and dry thoroughly. Back may bo 
rubbed with alcohol and dusted with talcum pow- 
der. Expose the body as little as possible. Dry 
each part thoroughly as soon as washed. Mouth 
should be washed thoroughly. 

Mouth Wash: Six to eight drops of alcohol in 
one-half glass of cold water. Equal parts of tinc- 
ture of orris, rose water and alcohol may be used 
or a solution of boric acid. Listerine or lemon 



FAMILY DOCTOR, HEALTH— HOME NURSING 



375 



juice diluted with water may be used or equal 
parts of lemon juice and glycerine. 
General Care 

Pulse and Temperature: The clinical thermom- 
eter ia of great value to the mother in the home. 
To use the thermometer, shake down to 95 de- 
grees, place bulb under tongue, ask patient to 
close lips and hold thermometer for five minutes. 

To clean thermometer, wash in alcohol, or a 
carbolic acid solution (I to 20.) Wash thoroughly 
in cold water before using. 

Temperature 

Normal temperature, 98.4 to 98.6 degrees F. 
High fever, 103 to 105 degrees F. 

Moderate fever, 101 to 103 degrees F. Sub- 
normal, 97 to 98 degrees F. 



Note: About 70 pulse corresponds with 98.4 
degrees. 

Respiration: Notice the rise and fall of the chest 
in breathing. The normal respiration is from 16 
to 1 8 per minute. 

Feeding the Patient 
Attractiveness is an important point to be con- 
sidered in the preparation of meals for the in- 
valid. A well-planned tray is more important than 
the well-planned meal for the normal person. It 
is absolutely necessary to study the needs of the 
patient and to plan a well-balanced meal to suit 
that condition, being careful to observe individual 
taste when it does not introduce some injurious 
food into the meal.

of water) or hydrogen peroxide. 

5. Wrap with sterile bandage. 

Burns 
Acid (except carbolic). 

1. Wash with water. 

2. Wash with lime water or a mixture of bak- 
ing soda and water. 

Note: If the burn is from carbolic acid, wash 
in alcohol. 

3. Cover with carron oil (equal parts of lin- 
seed oil and lime >vater) and bandage. 

Alkali — Wash with water (neutralize with vine- 
gar or lemon juice). Cover with oil as in acid

tion of baking soda or carron oil. Bandage lightly 
to exclude air. 



Sunstroke — Place patient in cold bath and rub 
with ice. Ice water on head. 

Lightning Stroke — Warm bath (100 degrees). 
Mustard plaster over heart. Giving of stimulants, 
black coffee, I tablespoon brandy to equal part 
of water or one-half teaspoonful aromatic spirits 
of ammonia to one-third glass of hot water. 

Fainting — Lower head and raise feet. Loosen 
clothing. Open windows. Dash cold water over 
face. Rub limbs toward the body. If this does 
not restore consciousness very soon, apply heat 
and send for a physician. 

Drowning — To remove water from body, hold 
patient by the waist with head down. 

Clear mouth of mucous and pull tongue forward. 

To restore respiration: Place patient on back. 
Raise shoulders by means of a pillow or a roll of 
clothing.

meet over the stomach. Hold the arms in this 



376 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Sec. VII— FAMILY DOCTOR, HEALTH 



position for a few seconc^s and then repeat until 
about fifteen respirations have been completed. 
Be careful to keep the mouth open and the tongue 
forward. 

After consciousness is restored: 

Remove wet clothing. 

Hot bath. 

Heat applied over heart. 

Stimulants given. 

Brisk rubbing from extremities toward body. 

Croup — Cover bed with tent-like cover (use 
sheet). Place funnel of paper in nose of teakettle.

of funnel at back of tent, being careful to have 
the funnel at least two feet above the patient. 
Place hot fomentations over chest and round 
throat. Cause vomiting by means of oil. 

POISONS 

Prevention: Extreme care is necessary. Be sure 
that bottles are properly labeled. Be sure that 
poisons are placed out of reach of children. Keep 
poisons in a special place to prevent accident. Do 
not take medicine in a dark room. Look at the 
label before removing cork.

by two tablespoonsful of Epsom salt. 

Ammonia — Vinegar or lemon juice. Follow by 
soothing liquids. 

Poison Ivy — Wash in three per cent, solution of 
boracic acid solution. Follow by zinc ointment. 



EMERGENCIES IN GENERAL 

Before applying first aid methods, have a physician sent for. If patient is on the ground 
make the bystanders move back; if the accident is indoors, open the windows; if in a 
crowded public place indoors, carry the patient to an adjoining room or outdoors. 

Fainting — Due to bad air, mental shock from bad news, etc. Loosen the clothing, 
put a cloth wet in very cold water, at back of neck, lay patient with head slightly lowered. 
This treatment, with plenty of fresh air, will usually restore the patient quickly. It may be 
advisable to give a stimulant, aromatic ammonia, if obtainable, 20 drops in a tabelspoonful 
of water, repeated if necessary in ten minutes. 

In Shock, or unconsciousness from a profound excitement to the nervous system, in- 
stead of simple fainting, do not conclude that the broken leg or open wound causing the 
shock is necessarily of first importance. If there is insensibility, pallor, weak or absent pulse, 
or irregular, or feeble respiration, this as a rule must receive first attention. 

Restore normal heat, wrap patient in blankets, coats or rugs, apply hot water bottles 
or hot bricks or irons, and flannel wrung from hot water, to abdomen or extremities, and 
re-establish the circulation. Use stimulant, aromatic ammonia, coffee, brandy, or whiskey, 
diluted properly in hot water, and repeat in ten minutes. A patient apparently wholly uncon- 
scious will often swallow if a liquid is poured slowly over back of tongue; but watch out 
not to choke him. Absolute quiet. 



FAMILY DOCTOR, HEALTH— EMERGENCIES 377 



If it is the head that is injured, or the patient is delirious or highly excited, avoid 
stimulants; exert effort to quiet and soothe him. Do not use a stimulant if there is a hem- 
orrhage. 

Hemorrhage — Place patient with wound higher than the heart; if in bed and the hem- 
orrhage is from lungs, throat, nose or head, elevate the head of the bed high as possible. 
If from the bowels, bladder, abdomen, or lower parts, elevate foot of bed. If from a limb, 
elevate the limb. 

If it is a profuse, throbbing, spurting hemorrhage, lose no time; it is probably direct 
from a severed artery. Thrust the fingers right into the wound and press tight against 
where the blood seems to issue and try to stop the flow. Use a tourniquet, if possible. A 
very cold or very hot clean compress is preferable to the fingers, but unsterilized fingers 
are better than letting a patient bleed to death. Be sure to tell the doctor about having 
used the tourniquet. 

Try to find a point away from the wound where pressure will retard the flow of blood, 
by closing the blood vessels leading to it, and apply there a firm bandage, with a hard 
knot held and pressed tight at that point. Don't fail to tell the doctor about the tourniquet. 

A Venous Hemorrhage — usually from the rupture of a varicose vein — should have 
pressure applied below the wound instead of above it. It can be determined by the blood 
being darker, sometimes a purplish tinge, and by the fact that it flows steadily, not in 
spurts. If in doubt tie both above and below the wound. The doctor must be advised of 
the tourniquet. 

If the scalp is cut or it is a wound where the edges can be brought together, clean 
with hot water, boiled if possible, and close wound with gauze, hot. 

Artificial Respiration — Place patient face down, and pass fingers into throat to remove 
whatever may be obstructing the air. TTien turn him over, pull the tongue out by grasping 
it with a cloth — the fingers alone will slip — and hold it out and down. Put a pillow or 
coat under back so as to slightly elevate the chest. Stand at patient's head, grasp the arms, 
draw them up until they meet above head ; lower the arms, make the elbows meet over 
the stomach. Repeat in rythmic motions, about four seconds for the complete act. As 
soon as normal respiration is established, treat for shock as described above. 

Choking — If a child, and if the fingers will not dislodge the obstruction, swing the 
patient by the feet, have the back slapped sharply, and compress the chest with one hand 
between shoulders and one in front. If not at once relieved run with child to a doctor. 
If adult, lay on stomach. 

Drowning — Empty the lungs by holding patient by the stomach with head down, or 
rolling him on his stomach on a barrel or chair with a coat or hard pillow in it. Then apply 
the artificial respiration methods as above; finally the treatment for shock after respiration 
is restored. 

Do not give up until a physician tells you to — not even if the physician is an hour in 
coming. Persons have been resuscitated from drowning an hour or two after it was thought 
there was no hope. 

A Broken Bone — Notify physician, then support the broken member with an impro- 
vised splint, avoiding any pressure at the injured point; cover with a cloth and keep it 
wet with cold water; keep patient as quiet and comfortable as possible until the doctor 
arrives. Do not try to set the broken points of the bone together. 



378 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Sec. VII— FAMILY DOCTOR. HEALTH 

Sprains — Apply hot water for an hour or two. Immerse ankle, or wrist, in very hot 
water and increase heat of water to the limit of endurance; keep it at as hot temperature 
as it can stand for several hours. Repeat daily. When relieved apply adhesive strips or 
bandage to support the injured ligaments. Immobilize; i. e., see that joint is immovable. 

Dislocation — Pull into position, if possible ; a physician may have to do this ; you may 
simply have to wait if one or two trials are so painful to the patient as to show danger of 
his fainting. Apply treatment for sprains. 

Convlusions in Children — Prepare bath as hot as can safely bear; add two teaspoon- 
fuls mustard to small tub of water. If it can be done more quickly wrap child in blanket 
wrung from very hot water; use care not to bum the child's tender flesh. Apply cold wet 
towel to the head in any event. Empty the bowels as quickly as it can be done; best 
method, an enema of warm water with castile soap, or glycerine or olive oil. Give child 
a teaspoonful of ipecac every 1 5 minutes or have him drink warm water until he vomits, or 
induce vomiting by other means. 

EVERYDAY ACCIDENTS 

Accidents will happen as long as we are human. The irritating part is that we do 
not expect them. They all have one thing in common — they happen at the wrong time. 
When you have no sticking plaster you cut your finger. When a child burns his hand 
at the bonfire you are without olive oil or ointment to soothe the pain. Be prepared in 
time of peace. 

A good many serious results have been avoided by having a wound dressed prop- 
erly in the nick of time. Every household, that is to say every mother, ought to have a 
little box, cabinet or other safe place always filled with a few essentials for emergency use. 

Sticking plaster in various sizes ought to be the first thing in this cabinet. A small 
bottle of olive oil comes next. It is the open blister which sometimes causes tetanus. Per- 
oxide, carbolic acid diluted at 50 per cent, boracic acid for the eyes and to wash out sores 
before putting dressing on, are articles not to be dispensed with. Turpentine is also a 
splendid thing against infection of sores from rusty nails. 

Do not forget the almost inevitable bottle of castor oil or milk of magnesia in case of 
fever and indigestion. A small quantity of essence of peppermint and spirits of ammonia 
should also be added, because sick stomach is a frequent occurrence with the little ones. 
A box of bicarbonate of soda and one of Epsom salts are indispensable. 

Liniment Inflammable — Never use a liniment near an open flame, for a liniment usu- 
ally contains some substance of an inflammable nature. 

For a Rusty Nail Accident paint with tincture iodine at once on the afflicted part. 

Foreign Matter in the Eye — If a smut has only gone on to the edge of your eye, it is 
quite easy to take off, but if it has got right in it may be difficult to move. 

An excellent method, if you are out of doors and have no implements at hand, is to 
shut the good eye, hold down the lid with your finger and roll the bad eye as much as 
you possibly can. Try to look with it right round to one side and then round to the other 
side. After you have done this for a minute or so, wipe the eye carefully with a soft hand- 
kerchief. You will probably find that the smut comes off on the handkerchief, as the roll- 
ing has shifted it to the front and onto the edge of the lid and made it easy to reach. 

Another way is to close the bad eye with your finger, leaving the good eye open. 
Then blow your nose violently two or three times. When you open the bad eye again you 



FAMILY DOCTOR, HEALTH— ACCIDENTS 379 

will probably find that it is quite comfortable, and that the smut has vanished. The tears 
have washed it out. 

If the accident occurs indoors, where there is someone to help you, the best way 
of putting the matter right is to get some one to dip a small brush in castor oil and take 
the smut away with that. You must use castor oil, not olive oil, which might possibly 
injure the eye, and you must have a very soft,clean brush. The patient should look up to 
the ceiling if the smut is at the bottom of the eye, and sideways and downwards if it is at 
the top. 

Swallowing a Fish Bone — Swallowing a piece of dry bread or cracker, if a fish bone is 
lodged in the throat, is a good remedy, but the acid from a lemon slowly sucked and swal- 
lowed will dissolve the bone to a jelly so that it will slip down easily.

ELBOW GREASE 

WITH HOT WATER AND SOAP 

Modern Army Practice, as taught in the Medical Officers' Reserve Corps, discards all use- 
lessness and foolishness. In the Armies of the Allies, the entire question of antiseptics 
and disinfectants simmers down to about ten per cent credit to two or three simple 
chemicals, and ninety per cent soap and hot water and ELBOW GREASE. 

Every woman should read and study the following LECTURE, given before the Med- 
ical Officers' Reserve Corps, Camp Greenleaf, Medical Officers' Training Camp, Fort 
Oglethorpe, Georgia, October, 1917. This is army training for medical officers. 

DISINFECTION AND ISOLATION 

By MAJOR ABBOTT of the U. S. Army 

DO IT WELI^DO IT CHEERFULLY— DO IT NOW 

I suppose a good many of you men in this audience have had the experience of going into 
houses and being met by a terrible stink, and when you looked about you found little 
saucers of badly smelling stuff under the sofa, under the table, under the bed, around the 
hallways, and other places. That was one of the old ways of disinfection and purifying 
the atmosphere. 1 may be wrong about it, but 1 have an idea it started from the days when 
the only disinfection known, in which any confidence was placed, was the burning of sul- 
phur; and in the very old book on quarantine and isolation you would see pictures of the 
Health Doctor dressed in oil silk or leather, looking as if he had on a gas mask extending 
down to his feet. He is depicted as burning sulphur in an open brazier and going through 
the motions of purifying the atmosphere. As funny as that may be, it is fundamentally the 
idea which Lyster held. Lyster had the idea that had existed for years that the atmosphere 
reeked w^ith living, infective germs. It was also thought that round about a person having a 
contagious disease there was always an atmosphere that was diseased, laden with disease 
producing germs. Today we know that is not so. It is very doubtful to the minds of 
many who have studied this subject that there is little if any conveyance of disease by 
the atmosphere. The general opinion is that conveyance of disease from one individual 
to another is by direct contact, or by objects which have been in immediate contact with 
diseased persons. I shall refer to that later on. 

PERFECT NONSENSE of surgical work, but such disinfection as is em- 

I am asked to speak on the question of disin- ployed in contagious disease. If a person with a 

fection and isolation. The reason for this invita- contagious disease has occupied a room, and you 

lion I think is due to the fact that a great many want the room safe for somebody else to sleep in, 

men think that the spraying about of a little for- X"" must destroy the specific disease producing 

maldehyde and raising a smell, which causes your agents. It is not necessary to destroy all living 

eyes to water, and causes you to be very uncom- microscopic bodies. The two things are quite 

fortable for a few minutes, is disinfecting. It is different. Take, for instance, a typhoid stool, you 

perfect nonsense: it does not do anything of the ^now it is infective: that it can be disinfected very 

kind. For instance, you can fill a room with the "»''y ^V Pou"ng a little boiling water on it, about 

old formaldehyde lamps, with which most of you »» '""<='» «» *>>« amount of the stool, and allowing 

are acquainted, close the room up tight, and all '* '° ''a"'^ ^° <:°°': '' " '•>«" disinfected. But it is 

those lamps will not generate enough formaldehyde "°' sterilized. We do not care whether it is steri- 

to properly disinfect that room. Let us under- ''««^ °^ "°' »° '°"g »» >' " incapable of convey- 

stand before we begin what disinfection aims to '"K typhoid fever. That is the distinction between

necessarily sterilization. Sterilization is another all know, means the destruction of bad odors, 

thing. In most of your work, you don't care Sometimes bad odors creep in where one has been 

whether you sterilize or not. I am not speaking careless, but as a rule bad odors have no business 

381 



382 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Sec. VII— FAMILY DOCTOR. HEALTH 



to exist, and if we are alert in the matter of clean- 
liness there will be no bad odors. Deodorization 
can be used sometimes where circumstances are 
such that call for its use, but it does not neces- 
sarily disinfect. It is better to prevent the de- 
velopment of bad odors than to try to destroy 
them. Antiseptics, you all know what that means, 
may or may not be disinfectants. Antiseptics are 
substances that prevent the growth of organism, 
but are not always germicidal. It is not my inten- 
tion to go into the long list of germicides. You 
find every book filled with them, but my intention 
this morning is to bring the matter down to the 
simplest basis and to see what we can do with the 
things always at hand. You will have no manu- 
facturing chemist at hand on the march or in 
camp, and you will have to get results with what 
you have at hand. Let us discuss for a few min- 
utes the way in which disinfectants act. We can 
begin by stating that there is no necessity what- 
ever for trying to disinfect the atmosphere; the 
atmosphere is probably not infected; and if it were, 
I doubt if we could disinfect it with the means at 
our disposal. 

NO ATMOSPHERIC DISINFECTION 

Lyster, in his early laboratory work, operated 
under a carbolic acid spray, the idea being that the 
atmosphere was alive ■with living gernns and the 
spraying killed them. We know now that the at- 
mosphere is not alive w^ith germs. In order for 
a disinfectant to act, it must come in immediate 
contact w^ith the germ to be killed. We do not 
know^ as much as we would like of the philosophy 
of disinfection, but we know sufficient to justify 
this statement, if w^e destroy germs by chemical 
disinfectants, there has been a destructive union. 
When, for example, corrosive sublimate is used for 
the purpose of killing germ life, we find that a 
definite amount of the salt will kill a definite 
amount of germs. Just as a certain amount of 
hydrochloric acid will neutralize a certain amount 
of caustic soda. Both factors in such a union have 
lost their characteristics. But if you have an in- 
fected stool and mix corrosive sublimate with it, 
the chances are a great part, if not all of it, will 
combine with protoid material, other than the 
infected germ, and you may or may not accom- 
plish what you have set out to do. Some of the 
germicides act as protoplosnic poisons. Hydro- 
cyanic acid, for instance, acts in that way in all 
probability. They combine with material, but its 
action is not quite clear. Nevertheless, it results 
in the death of the germ. Then we have the oxi- 
dizing and reducing agents, and the elements react- 
ing for the disassociating action of the electric 
current. We know sea water is not germicidal, 
but, suppose we pass an electric current through 
the sea salt. By that we disassociate the halogen 
compounds and in the nascent they are active 
germicides. As a matter of fact, if the electric 



current be passed through rain sewerage, reeking 
with living germs, you bring about a complete dis- 
infection of it through such disassociation of salts 
contained in it. 

THE ACTION OF SUNLIGHT 

Then, we have sunlight. We cannot explain 
hov^r sunlight acts, but we know it does, but it only 
acts under certain conditions, and in a very limited 
degree. We have all been taught that fresh air 
and sunlight are great purifiers. If you take a 
clear transparent gelatine, such as is used in labo- 
ratories, and inoculate that gelatine with thou- 
sands of bacteria, and put part of it in a shadow 
and the other w^here the sun can strike It under 
the most favorable conditions you v^ill find after 
exposure of half an hour that many of the germs 
that have been exposed to the sunlight will not 
grow, and those under the shadow w^ill grow abun- 
dantly. Such observations led to some very inter- 
esting experiments with furs and textiles, which 
could not be disinfected with heat or chemicals 
without destroying them. The results of these ex- 
periments w^ere of no practical use. It w^as found 
that after purposely infected furs had been placed 
in the direct sunlight for varying lengths of time 
only the tips of the furs w^ere disinfected. In other 
words, the slight shadow cast by the hairs a short 
distance down into the fur protected the sun's 
action. While interesting, the experiment was of 
no practical use. Now, we come to the universal 
purifier, upon w^hich you can always rely, and 
practically always get: that is heat. 

THE UNIVERSAL PURIFIER— HEAT 

On the road and in camp we can always get 
fire and hot water. Don't think it necessary to burn 
all infected objects. It is often easier to burn use- 
less infected objects than to disinfect them. Use 
heat so as to disinfect without destroying. It is 
not always necessary to use the excessive grades 
of heat we are sometimes told. You have to re- 
member that not all germs are equally resistant, 
and it is interesting to note that those most lowly 
resistant are the ones w^e deal with most frequently. 
Very few of the known disease producing germs are 
of high resistance. The anthrax germ is of high 
resistance, but only very rarely encountered in our 
v/ork. The tetanus germ is resistant, but we com- 
bat its lethal activities with antitoxin, and on all 
the fronts we have a supply of antitoxin. Cholera, 
typhoid fever, dysentery, diphtheria, etc.. are lowly 
resisting germs. They do not even require boiling 
water for their destruction. The reason why the 
term boiling water is used, is to eliminate the use 
of a thermometer. If you have an orderly who 
has never been trained in the laboratory, and you 
tell him to bring the temperature of water to 70° 
or 75^ C, he may not know what JS*-* C. means, 
and you do not always have a thermometer at 
hand; but if you tell him to boil it, he knows what 



FAMILY DOCTOR— HEALTH— ELBOW GREASE 



383 



it means. If you have a thermometer about you, 
and desire not to seriously injure objects being 
disinfected, you can disinfect practically everything 
you want if you expose them to water of 80^ C. 
temperature for half an hour. 

DISINFECTING WITH STEAM 

Another means of disinfecting by moist heat is 
ateam. You ask, how are we to get steam on the 
road? With a very little ingenuity you can make 
a steam sterilizer, if you remember that it is only 
a glorified potato steamer, such as is in every 
kitchen; a tin can with a perforated false bottom, 
6 inches from the bottom of the can, and a cover 
to the can, makes an excellent sterilizer. About 
4 inches of water in the can, the false bottom put 
in place and the objects to be sterilized put into 
the chamber, the can covered and put on the fire 
and the water kept boiling for one-half hour is all 
that is needed. That is only a modication of the 
Serbian barrel you have seen referred to in the 
books. The Serbian barrel is only a barrel with 
a cover and holes in the bottom. It is placed, 
after being filled with obects to be disinfected and 
covered — over a receptacle containing boiling 
water. The cracks between barrel and water re- 
ceptacle are plastered up with mud and the steam 
allowed to pass through the barrel for the required 
time. You can make one in a few minutes, and 
there is no reason in the world why it should not 
do the work. Boiling water is one of the most 
useful things you can use, you can get it anywhere. 
1 am not speaking about disinfecting surgical in- 
struments in the operating room, but of what you 
can do and must do on the road. 

DISINFECTION AND ISOLATION 
Another question comes up in connection with 
this matter. To what extent are you going to use 
disinfectants, and to what extent are you to try 
isolation when cases of infectious diseases break 
out among troops? You will not be supplied with 
equipment such as you find in our big municipal 
hospitals for the care of contagious disease. Can 
anything be done to prevent the spread of disease) 
I think it can, and usually without much disinfec- 
tion at all. I suppose if I were to say to most men 
in this audience, *'l will take you into an operating 
room, shall not give you any chemicals at all, and 
I want you to define a reasonably safe aseptic 
system," I don't believe there is a man in the audi- 
ence who could not write out a reasonably safe 
system. If you remember that, when the time 
comes to care for germ infective cases you can 
easily win the fight. In many hospitals now the 
contagious diseases are isolated by housing them 
in separate buildings, or in a separate part of the 
building, and for convenience, this is desirable. 
But it is not a necessity. Unless you are absolutely 
careful of every aseptic detail you and your nurses 



will serve as a transmitter. In my own judgment 
careless doctors and attendants are the great trans- 
mitters of disease. I expect that is an extremely 
unpleasant statement, but when you examine into 
the facts, 1 think you will agree with me. A man 
who does not carry out on himself and insist that 
his associates and aids do likewise the most scrupu- 
lous aseptic precautions, is more apt to carry in- 
fection to the next person, than any amount of 
infected air, so-called. Doctors and nurses must 
not only be informed on what is meant by surgical 
aseptic, but must practice it by keeping themselves 
and all appliances surgically clean. Just now we 
have a few cases of measles in camp. There is a 
general opinion that the most infectious stage of 
measles is during the catarrhal condition that pre- 
cedes the eruption. 

MEASLES AN ILLUSTRATION 

We do not recognize measles when it is most 
infective. When aware that it is measles, what 
should we remember) We are to remember that 
the infectious material from that case is not, as 
we were formerly taught, blowing about by the 
air, but we are to remember that the infectious 
material of that disease has leaked away from the 
patient through the eyes, nose and mouth, and so 
far as we know, nowhere else. Consequently, all 
the bed clothing, the pillow slips and body cloth- 
ing of that individual are the things infected, and 
probably the only things. Any man, woman or 
child, with whom that individual has come in con- 
tact are to be isolated and kept under observation 
until we know whether they have or have not 
measles. When that is done, you have done all 
you can do. That is all there is to it. There is 
no sense whatever in burning a lot of sulphur and 
putting out formaldehyde in cases of that kind. 
The bed clothing, body clothing and pillow slips 
can be boiled and that is all that you can do. By 
doing that and isolating contacts outbreaks of 
measles can be held up. If you consult the daily 
reports in headquarters office, you will see for 
two months we have had an occasional case of 
measles, but we have had no spread. It would be 
a serious matter for us to have an outbreak of 
measles in this camp at the present time. 

Pneumonia following measles is a serious mat- 
ter, and we could not properly care for a large 
number of measles cases under our present sur- 
roundings, but by putting into practice the simple 
method of isolation of contacts for a period of 
observation, and the boiling of body clothing and 
bed clothing, it can be kept down. 

DIPHTHERIA, TYPHOID, SMALLPOX 

Similarly with diphtheria. We know that in 
cases of diphtheria the infectious matter comes 
from the throat and nowhere else; nothing from 
the skin, nothing from the urine, and nothing from 
the bowels. It is the same way in cases of typhoid 



384 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Sec. VII— FAMILY DOCTOR, HEALTH 



fever, dysentery and cholera. The infectious 
agents do not come from the skin, they are not 
breathed out, not coughed out, but they come from 
the bowels and urine in cases of typhoid fever, and 
from the bowels only in cases of cholera and dys- 
entery. You have but to disinfect the excreta. You 
can use almost anything you please, chloride of 
lime is one of the very best and cheapest and one 
of the most effective things we have. When we 
come to smallpox, 1 trust you don't encounter it, but 
if you do it is your own fault, and I hope you may 
have all the inconvenience possible, for you can 
prevent it by seeing that every man in your com- 
mand is successfully vaccinated. Don't take the 
man's word when he says he has already been 
vaccinated several times and it don't take. I have 
had that said to me time and time again. In most 
cases 1 have found that if the operation be properly 
performed and trustworthy virus used a successful 
vaccination results. 

I think from what I have said you will see that 
the principles of isolation are rather simple. You 
must know how the infectious matters leave the 
body; how they invade other bodies, and that it is 
not necessary to have elaborate apparatus for the 
destruction. Suppose we were all on the march 
with troops and had nothing but soap and water 
for washing purposes and infectious diseases ap- 
peared. Could we prevent the spread of such dis- 
eases and render tents and bedding safe for the 
use of other men? 

HOT WATER, SOAP AND ELBOW GREASE 

I do not believe that there is any method of dis- 
fection that is better than hot water, soap and 
elbow grease. Of course, vfe cannot take house- 
wives on the road with us, but if we could I would 
turn the housewives loose and let them "house- 
clean." Any germ that can resist the house-clean- 
ing process deserves to live. If all of you will 
tackle a shack or a tent and clean it the same 
vigorous way a vs^oman cleans up a house when 
she puts her mind on it, it will be a perfectly safe 
place to sleep, and I wouldn't hesitate to sleep 
there, or let my children sleep there. There is no 
better way to rid quarters of danger than that. 

What is the effect of airing quarters? Does the 
air have any effect in destroying germs? Only 
indirectly. Very few of the infective organisms 
with which we are acquainted will stand drying 
for any length of time. None of them will with- 
stand absolute drying, except in the spore stage. 
The atmosphere has a drying effect. Sunlight has 
a psychological effect; soap and water and elbow 
grease has a real effect. As most important ad- 
juncts we have bacterial prophylactic vaccines and 
the anti sera. Cleaning up, the use of prophylactic 
inoculations, vaccines and anti sera, aseptic hand- 
ling of cases and the isolation of contacts for ob- 
servation will usually solve most of our difficulties. 



USEFUL GERMICIDES 

As to useful germicides the list may be small. 
All of the caustic alkalis are germicidal. Ordinary 
unslaked lime is an excellent disinfectant. When 
unslaked lime is mixed with the mass until it reacts 
alkaline, the mass is disinfected in two or three 
hours. It is not sterilized, \ve don't care about 
that, but it is disinfected. Lime is usually sup- 
plied, because it is cheap, non-poisonous and ef- 
fective. 

Acids possess a germicidal action. Nitric acid 
and sulphuric acid, and many of the organic acids 
possess this property. Certain salts are used, but 
1 would not suggest the routine use as they are 
uncertain in their action. 1 cannot do better than 
advise you to pin some faith to chloride of lime 
and freshly slaked lime as two of the best. 

GASEOUS DISINFECTANTS 

As to gaseous disinfectants. One that is used 
is sulphur dioxide. For a century or more sulphur 
dioxide was the only gaseous disinfectant used, and 
we believed in it; but investigations show that in 
its dry state it has very little germicidal value. 

It is known that if steam be introduced into the 
room with the sulphur dioxide we have a germi- 
cide, but you bleach everything in the room. The 
brass work is tarnished, and as a result it is ob- 
jectionable. Sulphur dioxide is now limited large- 
ly, not to disinfecting purposes, but to the purpose 
of getting rid of vermin, for the destruction of 
rats, mice and insects, and there is probably noth- 
ing better. Another gaseous disinfectant that 1 
know none of you will use, yet it has a high ger- 
micidal power, is hydrocyanic acid. It is a very 
deadly poison, as you all know. In the hands of 
other than a trained and competent laboratory 
man hydrocyanic acid should not be used. 

THE FORMALDEHEYDE DELUSION 

We thought the millennium had been reached 
when formaldehyde was introduced. It came to 
us as a gas that had wonderful power. As for- 
maldeheyde gas is incompletely burned methol 
alcohol, we burned wood alcohol under such cir- 
cumstances that combustion was incomplete, and 
we thought we had sufficient formaldeheyde to do 
the 'work. So formaldeheyde lamps were sold to 
all of us. In five minutes sufficient formaldeheyde 
was generated to start our eyes watering, and we 
supposed germs were being killed. But it soon 
became evident that none of the lamps generated 
sufficient formaldeheyde to disinfect a room. When 
that fact was made known larger lamps were made, 
but with little or no advance. The next step taken 
was the disengagement of formaldeheyde from its 
solution. Apparatus was devised in which the 
formaldeheyde solution was subjected to high heat 
— the gas thus disengaged was led into the closed 
room by a tube passed through the keyhole. The 



FAMILY DOCTOR— HEALTH— ELBOW GREASE

beat of 3uch plans did not accomplish more than 
85 9<" of disinfection; it did not render free of dan- 
ger over over 85 of 100 purposely infected articles 
placed in the room. Then it was suggested to try 
out the old plan of using the spray, or a modifica- 
tion of it. It has been found by experiments and 
otherwise, that equal parts of saturated solution of 
formaldeheyde and water, when atomized over all 
horizontal surface of a room, in closets, in bureau 
drawers and bedding, will completely disinfect a 
closed and sealed room in from six to eight hours. 
The method has one defect: it is painful to the 
muscus membranes and in susceptible persons 
causes deomatitis. The irritation of the mucuous 
membrane is not a serious matter. The most effec- 
tive way I know of for applying formaldeheyde is 
in water, equal parts of formaldeheyde and water 
sprayed on in a house with an atomizer, so you can 
get the combined action of formaldeheyde in solu- 
tion, and of the gas that is disengaged from it. 

If 1 bring you any message at all in this lecture, 
it is this: that you can get results by ordinary 
house-cleaning methods. 

ISOLATION 

Some of you have doubtless read those inter- 
esting articles by Dr. Chapin, of Rhode Island. 
He has been advocating the abandonment of ter- 
minal disinfection. 1 think he is right. He strong- 
ly advocates the abandonment of many former 
methods of isolation. He maintains that one can 
keep various infective cases side by side in the 
same hospital ward without any transmission. 
About two years or more before Dr. Chapin whote 



those articles, large hospitals in France and Eng- 
land had fully proven out that point. They had 
simply taken large wards, separated these cases 
one from the other, not by partitions, but by 
screens, had them all in the same room. They 
had specially trained attendants, who had been 
trained in surgical asepiii. A nurse, when she 
was in attendance upon a case of measles, for in- 
stance, knew perfectly well what was expected of 
her before she went to attend a case of diphtheria, 
etc. She wore, when she attended a case of 
measles, an overslip to cover her clothing, her hair 
was also covered, and when she left the case she 
left her overslip in the measles room. Her hands 
were washed with soap and water, and if need be, 
disinfected. She then could go safely to the scarlet 
fever case and put on the gown she should wear 
with that case, and when she left that case she 
could go to the diphtheria case. The records of 
those hospitals has shown that in not one instance 
has there been any more mixed infection or trans- 
mission of infection where these methods have been 
used than by the old methods which involved great 
expenditures, and which have been found to be 
often defective. So, we are coming now, I think, 
to see these things in a very common sense way. 

CONCLUSION 
If we know where the infection occurs, know 
the places through which the infectious agents 
escape from the individual, and know the agents 
by which these infectious agents can be killed, we 
will realize that we can control these cases with- 
out elaborate equipment.

DIET FOR INVALIDS 

SOME TEMPTING, NOURISHING, EASILY DIGESTED DISHES 
FOR THE SICK AND CONVALESCENT 

(From Iowa State College Bulletin, "Home Nursing") 

Invalid diet is classified as: 

I. Liquid: Including broths, milk, cocoa, cream soups. 
11. Soft Diet: Including soft cooked eggs, milk toast, custards. 
111. Solid: Including cereals, eggs, vegetables, meat, desserts. 

The doctor will prescribe the diet and the nurse must see that it is properly 
prepared and served. She should never consult the patient as to his diet. If he 
should express a desire for a certain food which is allowable, it may be served at 
the next meal. 

Before bringing in the tray, have the patient ready for the meal — face and 
hands bathed and pillows adjusted. If an invalid's table is not available, a pile of 
magazines may be put on each side of the patient's knees on w^hich to set the tray. 
The tray should be made just as attractive as possible — never crow^ded. It is bet- 
ter to serve too little and bring more on request than to destroy the appetite with 
an overloaded tray. Serve hot foods hot and cold foods cold. 

Some foods though not especially nourishing are useful as stimulants to the 
appetite. Among these are fruit beverages, beef tea and oysters. Milk and eggs 
are the main articles of food in soft diet. These should both be cooked at a low 
temperature because of the albumen, which is rendered very indigestible by boiling. 

Toast should be crisp all through, not just browned on surface. It may be 
softened with hot milk or water. 

Cereals should be thoroughly cooked. 
Cream soups add variety to the milk diet. 

Desserts, as gelatin and ices, furnish an attractive means of serving liquid 
foods in solid form.

Chicken Broth — Cut 2 lbs. chicken into pieces: 
cover with 2 quarts cold water; add I small onion, 
simmer three hours or until meat is tender. Re- 
move meat, cool stock, remove fat, reheat and 
add y^ cups cooked rice. Season and serve. 

Egg Broth — I cup hot meat broth, I egg, Yi 
teaspoonful salt. Beat the white and yolk of egg 
separately. To the yolk add gradually the hot 
broth, stirring constantly. Add salt and fold in 
well beaten white. Reheat and serve. 

Raw Beef Sandwich Scrape beef with dull knife, 

place between buttered slices of bread. Cut in 
fancy shapes. Toast in oven. (Meat for this pur- 
pose must be inspected). 

Fruit Whip — 4 tablespoonfuls fruit pulp, white 
of 1 egg, 2 tablespoonfuls powdered sugar, lemon 
juice to taste. Beat white of egg until stiff, add 
pulp, sugar, and lemon juice to taste. Beat until 
stiff. Serve with boiled custard. 

Oat Jelly — Yi cup rolled oats, !4 teaspoonful 
salt, 1 Yl cups boiling water. Add oats mixed with 
salt to boiling water gradually. Boil 2 minutes, 
then steam in double boiler 45 minutes to 1 hour. 
Force through a fine strainer, mould, chill and 
serve with sugar and cream. 

Note: When the jelly begins to harden, add 1 
tablespoonful dissolved gelatin and Yl c"P whipped 
cream, mould in small cups and serve with straw- 
berries and cream as a dessert or as a breakfast 
dish. 

Poached Eggs — Eggs for poaching should be as 
fresh as possible. If not perfectly fresh, the 
tendency to flatten may be overcome by adding 
a small amount of vinegar to the water in which 
they are cooked. They may also be kept round 
by stirring the water until it is whirling vigorously 
and dropping the egg into it. 

Salt may be used instead of vinegar: the eggs 
thereafter need not be salted at table. 

Eggs Scrambled in Milk — 2 eggs, 2 slices toast, 
Yt, teaspoonful salt, 2 tablespoonfuls milk, I tea- 
spoonful butter. Beat whites and yolks separately. 



add salt to yolks. Fold in whites. Add to hot milk 
and pour into a buttered pan. Cook until creamy, 
stirring and scrapeing from the bottom of the pan 
as it thickens. 

Beef Broth Custard — 54 cup beef broth, 2 eggs, 
Ya cup ground carrot, 1 tablespoon chopped pep- 
per, I teaspoonful salt, J/g teaspoonful pepper. 
Beat eggs and add the other ingredients. Pour 
into ramekins and bake in a moderate oven until 
firm. 

Egg Lemonade — 2 tablespoonfuls syrup, 2 table- 
spoonfuls lemon juice, Y^ cup cold water, 1 egg. 
Mix syrup and lemoii juice. Add cold water. 
Beat the yolk and white of the egg separately. Fill 
a glass half full of lemonade. Add I/3 of the beaten 
white and cover with one-third of the beaten 
yolk. Pour over a small portion of the lemonade, 
and repeat until all of the egg and lemonade are 
used. Set glass on small plate v^ith doily. Place 
two straws in glass of lemonade. Serve on a tray 
with a yello^v flower. 

A Nutritious Beverage — I quart milk, I pint 
cream, 4 eggs, a few grains salt. Beat the eggs, 
add to cream, milk and salt. Mix thoroughly. 
Divide into four parts. Season as desired. This 
is sufficient for four feedings. 

Creamed Egg — I egg, J/J cup milk, Yl table- 
spoonful butter, Ya teaspoonful salt, I slice toast. 
Beat egg slightly, add salt. Heat milk and butter 
in double boiler, add egg and cook until creaniy. 
Remove crust fronu bread, toast a golden brown, 
place egg on toast, garnish and serve at once. 

Toast — Cut bread in Ya i"- slices, remove crust 
and toast a golden brown. It should be crisp all 
through. 

Milk Toast — 2 slices of toast, I teaspoonful but- 
ter, 1 tablespoonful flour, 1 cup milk, Yl tea- 
spoonful salt. Melt the butter, add dry ingredients, 
stir until thoroughly blended; add milk gradually 
and cook until it thickens. Pour over buttered 
toast. 



THE NURSE'S KITCHEN 
Some Other Invalid Recipes 



Cream Toast — Make thin slices of golden brown 
toast, crisp and dry. Place the slices in a wire 
sieve, and steam until soft over hot water. Then 

butter and put in a soup plate about three slices 

cut in half. Over them pour white sauce. Make 
this by heating a cupful of milk in a double boiler 
and then adding two tablespoonfuls of flour rubbed 
into two tablespoonfuls of butter. Cook gently 
over a low heat until the flour has lost its starchy 



taste. Season with salt and pepper and serve very 
hot. Such a dish loses its appetizing qualities if 
it is not hot when served, so it should be carefully 
covered in transit from the kitchen to the room. 

Egg-nog Heat the yolk of an egg until it is 

creamy and add a pinch of salt; then add enough 
milk to fill a glass three-quarters full. Last, add 
the white beaten stiff, and sprinkle with grated

nutmeg. This is nourishing and excepting in cases 
where raw egg cannot be digested, is easily assim- 
ilated. Use whiskey or brandy in egg-nog only 
if patient needs stimulant on doctor's orders. 

Lamb Broth — Lamb broth can be taken by al- 
most every one. Here is a good recipe for mak- 
ing it. Have a pound of the neck of lamb cut 
into small pieces and put it in a granite or alumi- 
num saucepan with two cupfuls of cold water 
for two hours. Then bring it to the boiling point 
and let it cook just below the boiling point, for 
three hours. Strain and season with salt. This 
can be made in a tireless Sooker. 

Chicken Broth — This can be made in the same 
way as lamb broth. Use the neck, the wings, and 
the back of chicken, and reserve the other parts 
for other uses. If rice can be taken, a little rice 
^vell boiled, can be added to either chicken or 
lamb broth. 

Clam Broth — Wash six clams and put them in 
a kettle with half a cupful of cold water. Steam 
until they have opened, strain, and serve. Clam 
broth and beef broth may both be frozen, just to 
the mush stage, and then served in a sherbet glass. 
A feverish patient often finds this broth sherbet 
very tempting. 

Cornmeal Gruel — All gruels must be thoroughly 
cooked, not very thick, and free from lumps. Put 
three tablespoonfuls of cornmeal into a third of 
a cupful of cold water, salt to taste, and then add 
two cupfuls of boiling ^vater. Boil twenty minutes, 
stirring constantly, or else cook in a double boiler 
an hour. 

Cracker Cruel — Break a soda cracker or two, 
buttered thin, into a cupful of boiling milk, and 
cook, stirring constantly, for three or four minutes. 
Season with salt. 

Oatmeal Gruel — Cook half a cupful of prepared 
oatmeal in a quart of boiling salted water for a 
quarter of an hour. 

Rice Gruel — Cook two tablespoonfuls of rice in 
two cupfuls of salted water. When the rice is 
cooked to pieces, strain and dilute to taste with 
hot milk. 

Stewed Prunes and Figs — Wash prunes or figs 
to be stewed and then soak in cold water for ten 
hours. Cook for half an hour in the same water. 
Sweeten slightly if necessary. 

Spinach on Toast — Cook some well-washed 
spinach for twenty minutes in boiling salted water, 
drain it and rub it through a sieve. Have ready 
a piece of buttered, thin toast which has been 
quickly dipped in boiling water. Moisten the 
spinach with a little melted butter, season with 
salt and pepper, and pile neatly on toast. 



Apple Snow — Bake an apple in an earthen dish, 
covered. Remove core and skin before baking. 
Then rub it through a sieve, add it to the well- 
beaten white of an egg and beat for twenty minutes. 
Sweeten to taste and serve piled up in a glass cup. 

Orange Whip — Squeeze the juice from an 
orange. Beat the white of an egg and add a 
tablespoonful of sugar and a little of the orange 
juice, beating stiff again. Then pour the rest of 
the juice into a glass cup, pile on the white and 
serve. 

Custard with Fruit — Very often good boiled 
custard can be served to advantage with fruit. The 
fruit adds attractiveness to the custard and so 
tempts the appetite. A few prunes, neatly cut in 
pieces, can be covered with custard; dates can bo 
used in the same way; orange pulp cut in dice 
can be added to it or a spoonful of apple snow 
can be placed on top of custard. 

Grape Fruit and Orange — Grapefruit pulp cut 
in dice and served in a glass with the juice of an 
orange and very little sugar, with a tablespoonful 
of brandy or sherry, if that is allowed, makes a 
most refreshing dish for an invalid. 

Bavarian Cream — Bavarian creams of all sorts 
make delicious and nourishing desserts for invalids. 
For chocolate Bavarian cream, soak half a box of 
gelatin in cold water for at least a half hour. 
In a double, boiler, heat one pint of milk and two 
ounces of grated chocolate: add the gelatine and 
stir until dissolved. Next add half a cup of sugar 
and remove from the stove. Turn into a deep bowl 
and add one teaspoonful of vanilla; set this bowl 
into a pan of ice water and stir until it thickens 
like a sauce; then add a pint of cream whipped 
stiff. Stir lightly, pour into a mold, wet with cold 
water, set it on ice and serve with whipped cream. 
This must be made very early in the morning if 
it is to be used for lunch or tea. If a fruit cream 
is desired substitute fruit juice, stewed and strained, 
or the juice from canned fruit, for the milk, omit- 
ting the grated chocolate. Both raspberry and 
peach Bavarian cream are delicious. 

Orange Albumen — White I egg, '/3 cup orange 
juice, Yi glass crushed ice, sugar if necessary, stir 
white of egg with fork. Add orange juice — strain 
over ice. 

Milk Whip Y^ cup cream milk, 2 teaspoonful 

sugar, few grains nutmeg, pinch salt, Yl teaspoon- 
ful vanilla or 3 teaspoonfuls sherry, few pieces of 
ice. Put in Mason jar, shake thoroughly, serve 
at once. 

Whey 1 cup milk at 98 degrees F., Y2 rennin 

tablet dissolved in cold water, mix, pour in bowl, 
allow to set. When thick cut in cubes and allow 
whey to rise. Strain.

Note: These suggestions for feeding the anemic 
patient are very similar to those used in the feed- 
ing of the tuberculous patient. The treatment 
needed in both cases is dietetic and hygienic rather 
than medical. 

Dietetic and hygienic treatment is the ideal 
method of caring for the human body. If used 
regularly and continuously it would not only help 
to correct such conditions as have been mentioned, 
but w^ould become a vital factor in the prevention 
of disease. 

MENUS FOR ANEMIC PATIENTS 
Breakfast — Stewed prunes, puffy omelet, oatmeal 
and cream, cream toast. 

Food Arranged According to Per Cent of Iron — 

Puffy omelet, stewed prunes, oatmeal and cream, 
cream toast. 

Dinner Baked potato, escalloped spinach, may- 
onnaise dressing, boiled mutton chop, combination 
salad, graham bread, chocolate bread pudding. 

Escalloped Spinach — 1 can cooked spinach, 2 
cups dry bread crumbs, Yl *^"P nieat stock, 4 
hard cooked eggs, I ]/2 cups sauce made with meat 
stock, buttered crumbs, t tablespoon lemon juice. 
Drain spinach and chop. Soak bread crumbs in 
J/2 cup meat stock and add to spinach. Cut hard 
cooked eggs in small pieces. Butter a shallow bak- 
ing dish, put in layer of spinach and bread crumbs, 
then layer of eggs. Cover with sauce. Continue 
in this order until dish is nearly filled. Cover with 



buttered crumbs. Bake in hot oven until crumba 
are brown. 

Chocolate Bread Pudding — 2 cups stale bread 
crumbs, 3 cups hot milk, I Yi squares chocolate, 
2/3 cup sugar, 2 eggs, Ya teaspoonful salt. Soak 
bread in hot milk. Melt chocolate in pan over 
hot water, and add to bread and milk. Beat 
eggs, add sugar, salt and vanilla. Add to first 
mixture. Pour into buttered pan. Set in dish 
of hot w^ater and bake in moderate oven until firm. 

III. TUBERCULOSIS 

Tuberculosis is a disease in which treatment is 
almost w^holly dietetic and hygenic. 

The appetite must be w^atched closely. Oil is 
given to afford an easily assimilated basis for re- 
newed organic growth. 

A change of climate sometimes stimulates the 
appetite, but unless it does, it is of little benefit. 

Diet 

Soups — Oyster, mutton, chicken or clam broth, 
barley, rice, bean, cream of celery or tomato, beef 
tea, peptonied milk gruel. 

Fish — Fresh fish broiled or boiled, oysters or 
clams. 

Meat — Roast beef, mutton, lamb chops, bacon, 
poultry, game, steaks. 

Fats — Butter and salad oils used abundantly. 

Eggs — Except fried. 

Farinaceous — Cream of wheat, oatmeal, hominy, 
rice, cornbread, milk toast, muffins, biscuit. 

Vegetables — Potatoes, spinach, onions, aspira- 
gus, peas, tomatoes, string beans, lettuce. 

Desserts — Apple pudding, custards stewed fruitSi 
rice, tapioca with fresh cream. 

Beverages Milk, cocoa, chocolate, water, but- 
termilk, cream. 

Avoid fried foods, hash, gravies, veal, pork, 
cabbage, turnips, cucumbers, pies, pastry, candy. 

IV. RHEUMATISM 

Suggestions 
Use starch and sugar moderately. Avoid the 
over-use of protein food. 

The patient should partake of water freely to 
assist in eliminating the waste products from the 
body. Lemonade and mineral waters are recom- 
mended.

Precautions 

Well planned meals prevent accumulation of 
vraste and consequently are vital factors toward 
physical equilibrium. 

Breakfast — Grape fruit, cream of wheat (no 
sugar), poached eggs, graham bread. 

Dinner — Mashed potatoes, cheese fondue, 
graham bread, lettuce and celery salad, lemon ice 
or baked apple and cream.

until lemon-colored. Cut and fold in whites of 
eggs beaten until stiff. Pour in a buttered baking 
dish and bake twenty minutes in moderate oven. 

V. DIABETES 

The disease is characterized by grape sugar in 
the urine on an ordinary diet, and is hereditary 
in one-third of all cases. 

The most effective treatment is dietetic and 
hygienic. 

TREATMENT 
Preventive Treatment 

Where distinct heredity is feared, exposure to 
cold and wet, all excitement of the nervous system 
as well as indulgence in alcohol and sweets should 
be avoided. 

It is necessary in all cases to use great caution 
in regard to diet and general hygiene. 

Avoid: 

Shocks and blows affecting the nervous system. 

Injuries to the back of the head and blov^s over 
the liver. 

Exposure to cold, wet and fatigue. 

Emotional strain and anxiety. 

Over-indulgence in starchy foods. 

Alcoholism. 

Dietetic Treatment 
I. Foods Allovred in Diabetes: 

t. Soups and broths made of meat of any kind 
Mrithout vegetables.

Patient should guard against taking cold and 
when possible should live in a moderately warm 
climate. Flannels should be worn next the skin 
in winter, and the body should be kept warm, for 
there is less heat producing power than nor- 
mally because of the lack of starches and sugar. 

The skin should be maintained in good condi- 
tion by frequent baths and massage. Only a mod- 
erate amount of exercise should be taken, but this 
should be in the open air. 

VI. OBESITY 
Diet to Regulate Weight 
Special Rules: 

1. Eat slowly, masticate thoroughly. 

2. Do not have more than three courses or 
five kinds of food at any one meal. 

3. Eat moderately, not to satisfy. — Thompson.

VII. UNDERWEIGHT 

Tne man who aaid. "It does not matter ao much 
what kind of a disease the body has. as the kind 
of a body the disease has." expressed the gener- 
ally accepted idea that the normally behaved body 
is more nearly able to resist disease. The body 
that meets the requirements with regard to weight 
is likely to have greater power to resist disease. 
The above table gives the relation between height, 
age and weight and serves as a guide in feeding 
the family. 

Suggestive List of Foods to Increase Weight 

Butter, cream, olive oil, bacon, baked potatoes, 
well cooked cereals, well baked bread, chocolate, 
cocoa, milk, cream soups, cream toast, custards, 
eggs, apples, raisins, prunes, figs, dates, oranges. 

Mineral Giving Vegetables 

Lettuce, celery, radishes, cabbage, spinach, 
cauliflower, turnips, tomatoes, carrots, parsnips. 

The fats and carbohydrates are especially im- 
portant as flesh builders, but the minerals given 
by the non-starchy vegetables are equally impor- 
tant, in that they help to maintain the normal 
activity of the body.

CARE OF THE NOSE AND THROAT 

The nose, mouth and throat are the gateways through which disease germs 
enter the body. Keep nostrils, mouth and throat clean and free from germs that 
breed disease. An antiseptic wash for the nose, mouth and throat should be reg- 
ularly used. The germs of cold and grippe, diphtheria, croup, scarlet fever and 
other diseases may find lodgment in these gateways of the body if you do not 
keep them in a sanitary condition. 

Spraying the nose and throat with an antiseptic douche will go a long ways 
toward warding off diseases, many of which enter the system through these or- 
gans. In Rigg's disease of the gums, poisonous germs of the mouth and throat in- 
fect the gums, and these should be rendered harmless by a germicidal w^ash. 
Bronchitis, pneumonia, rheumatism, appendicitis and other serious ailments may 
result from germs lodged in the nostrils, mouth or throat. 

A little vaseline or preparation of camphor and menthol rubbed into the nos- 
trils every night before retiring and again before going out in the morning will 
do a great deal toward preventing colds and will also prevent the formation of ad- 
hesions of hard mucous matter in the nose. 

COLDS AND SIGNS OF COLDS 

Snuffing and sneezing, a person with a cold is exceedingly miserable — an ob- 
ject of pity, but unless care is exercised he will have company in his misery. Colds 
are contagious and careless sneezing and coughing scatter cold germs to be breathed 
in by other unfortunates and start more colds. 

When you develop a cold it means that cold germs have begun to grow in 
your nose and throat and produce poisons that are absorbed into your body and 
give you that peculiar, miserable feeling that only a cold can produce. 

The best way to keep from catching cold is to accustom yourself to sudden 
changes of temperature. This can be done by taking a cold sponge bath over the 
back and front of your chest every morning. Next best is to avoid draughts. Keep 
the feet dry and escape the chill which causes congestion in the nose, throat and 
chest. Also avoid crowds, people who carelessly cough and sneeze, and hot, poorly 
ventilated rooms. 

To break up a cold take a hot drink at bed time and a strong laxative. Fresh 
air day and night is the best tonic in the world. If a cold hangs on for a month or 
longer be examined by your physician. It may mean the saving of much trouble 
and sickness. 

Preventions — Colds can be easily prevented if care is taken to avoid these things 
which lower the resistance of the body, and it one pays special attention to building up the 
resistance of the body. How important this is may be seen in the fact that athletes in 
training seldom, if ever, contract colds. 

How, then, are we to know that a cold is impending? First of all, in most cases 
there is a feeling of chilliness and slight feverishness. The head also feels stuffy and full; 
the mucous linings of the nose and throat feel dry and parched, due to congestion at these 
points. Frequently there is a feeling of languor, and an "aching" of the bones, especially 
at the joints. Headache is often present, and lack of appetite, bad breath and coated tongue 
almost invariably. The victim is usually constipated. 

397 



398 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Section VII— FAMILY DOCTOR. HEALTH 

Respiration — Winter colds bear a very close relation to respiration; indeed, many peo- 
ple testify to warding off colds by deep breathing, and one remedy for catarrh consists 
solely of breathing exercises. Any cold means congestion. A cold in the head means the 
presence of acute inflammation of the membrane lining the nose, generally an infection 
caused by germs gaining access to the tissues. During undue or unaccustomed exposure 
to cold the smaller blood vessels are contracted, consequently less blood is brought to the 
surface, resistance weakens, and the germs can attack more easily. Disregarding the 
weather conditions, the outsire air is always preferable to the room atmosphere. 

Good respiration will counteract this. A full breath quickens circulation; the rich 
blood, purified by the extra amount of good air in the lungs, races along, expands the tiny 
blood vessels, and sends a glow of warmth over the body. The work of the germs is can- 
celed. The next time you go out and feel the chill wind strike through you, and you start 
to hunch up your shoulders and contract your chest to get rid of the shivers, stop I Throw 
your head up, assume the correct standing posture with chest out and weight well forward. 
For a second you will shiver. Then take a deep breath, expanding your lungs to the ut- 
most of their capacity and exhale slowly. Always remember to breathe through your nose. 
The nose serves to warm and moisten the air so that it will not irritate the delicate struc- 
ture of the lungs. Now start walking forward briskly, swing your arms easily, and breathe 
as deeply as you can. 

First Aid — Under the heading of "Things to Do for a Cold," a bulletin of the Life 
Extension Institute of New York City condenses into a table these valuable hints on emer- 
gency treatment: 

"On first sign of a cold, a hot foot bath lasting half an hour, and a drink of hot lem- 
onade — or, better still, hot flavored tea (one-half ounce of whole flaxseed to a pint of boil- 
ing water, flavored with lemon peel or licorice root) will often break its force." 

"A brisk purge is also advisable." 

"A mild menthol-oil spray may be used occasionally in nose and throat." 

"Neck and chest and nostrils may be rubbed with camphorated oil." 

"If the throat is sore a gargle or spray of peroxide of hydrogen, one part to three parts 
of water, may be used." 

"Also cold compresses to the neck, or gauze pads saturated with equal parts of alcohol 
and water." 

"An alcohol rub-down is also good as a first-aid measure. Used externally alcohol is 
a real friend; internally, it is a dangerous enemy." 

"The spread of septic sore throat and other germ diseases by milk is very common. 
Pasteurised milk is safest during epidemics." 

"If there is severe headache, face ache, earache, pain in the chest, sore throat, or high 
fever, there should be no delay in calling a physician." 

Home-made Cough Syrup — Here is a formula for a home-made cough syrup that is 
highly recommended : One ounce each of horehound and licorice, two ounces of gum ara- 
bic, one pound of molasses and one teacupful of vinegar. Boil the horehound in a quart 
of water, dissolve the licorice and gum arabic in a little water first. Strain the horehound 
before adding the other ingredients. Now add the molasses and last of all the vinegar 
when it is nearly done. 

LA GRIPPE 

La Grippe, or Influenza, which often starts with a simple cold, is quite dif- 
ferent from a cold, and it is very important to distinguish between them. The after 
effects of La Grippe are often very serious. 



FAMILY DOCTOR. HEALTH— NOSE AND THROAT 399 



It starts, like a simple cold, with sneezing, coughing and fever, with com- 
plaint of a headache and a feeling of soreness in the muscles, so that one will say 
his "bones ache." He will complain of sore throat and languidness. 

The patient must be put to bed — and kept there until all symptoms have dis- 
appeared. La Grippe can usually be recognized by the fever, which is higher than 
that of a simple cold, and by the cough, which is rather rare at the beginning of 
any other kind of cold, and most especially by the fact that the patient feels really 
sick and prostrated and his "bones ache. 

La Grippe is caused by a distinct germ, which gains access through the nose 
and throat, if the germ reaches the lungs it may cause pneumonia or bronchitis; 
in the joints, they become painful and swollen with a type of inflammatory rheu- 
matism; if the germ reaches the heart it may cause severe heart disease. 

A person catches La Grippe from others who have it. The patient must be 
quarantined. The secretion from the nose, what he coughs up from the throat, 
and the practice of sneezing into the open air instead of a handkerchief, transmit 
the disease. 

La Grippe usually starts with a hard, dry cough, without any expectoration, 
and this may persist for weeks. Nausea and vomiting may occur and occasionally 
diarrhoe. The fever varies greatly, often from normal to 1 04 in one day, and may 
last, or come and go for weeks. 

Remedy — When an acute cold develops it is best to put the patient to bed on the chance 
that La Grippe germs may be there. Begin with the usual treatment for a simple cold. If 
a cough and fever develop it is probably La Grippe and a physician should be called at once. 

Quinine probably hastens the control of any recovery from La Grippe better than any 
other remedy; bromo-quinine is better than the sulphate; patient should be put to bed and 
encouraged to sleep. The cough, if severe, may require a sedative but this should be given 
only by a physician. A mustard plaster on chest will usually help the cough. 

The most important caution is that the patient be kept in bed until all the symptoms 
have been dispelled. The patient will probably remain weak and amaemic, in which case 
tonics should be given. 

Keep the bowels open both during the course of the disease and afterwards, and take 
"good care" of the health for several months; germs may remain in the system and rein- 
fect, if resistance is lowered. Unfortunately one attack does not leave one immune to that 
disease.

ONE OR TWO CHILDREN'S TROUBLES 

German Measles — Rare in children under two years of age; no relation to 
ordinary measles; one attack does not protect from another. The rash spreads 
rapidly over the body downwards; it appears in single red pin-point spots, not in 
groups or patches, as in regular measles. The child is not very sick, only slight 
fever, if any, and w^atering of the nose and eyes, as with a cold. 

Isolate the child for a week after eruption appears and guard against cold, as 
bronchitis is possible. For specific treatment follow advice of a physician. While 
it is not a serious disease there may be uncommon symptoms or development and 
it should be taken properly in hand. 



CHICKEN POX 



The eruption usually appears in pimples widely 
scattered over the body, scalp and face, occa- 
sionally groups of several together. The pimples 
become blisters very soon, and scabs follow. Pus 
may form under the scabs. New pimples appear 
as old ones dry. There is a great deal of itching 
but scratching or rubbing only makes it worse 
and leaves scars afterwards, somewhat like small- 



pox scars. There is some fever. 

It is very contagious. Isolate patient and call a 
physician, who will apply antiseptic and cooling 
ointments that will heal and disinfect and at the 
same time allay the itching so that the child can 
resist the impulse to scratch. Isolation necessary 
for about three weeks. 



ADENOIDS 



This is a small tonsiller structure back of the 
nose in the throat If it is enlarged or diseased, 
in children or adults, it should be removed. Only 
a physician, of course, can do this. Signs of 
trouble here, however, to give warning, are as 
follows: 

Restlessness at night, mouth breathing, snoring, 
bad general health and nervousness, or indolent. 



inactive mind and poor memory. Frequent head 
colds, nasal discharge becoming chronic, earache 
or inflammation of ears; any or all, or two or three 
of the above symptoms together may indicate ade- 
noids, and one should have the patient examined 
by a competent physician at once. The disease 
is one of childhood, in that the tonsils usually waste 
away after the age of puberty. 



TONSILS 



Enlarged or diseased tonsils cause catarrh and 
sore throat, and when any of such symptoms ap- 
pear, therefore, a physician should be consulted 



and make an examination. Diseased tonsils cause 
remote diseases which obtain access by infection, 
and especially pave the way to rheumatitm. 



VACCINATION 



Vaccination time is best when a baby is three to 
six months of age, unless he is delicate or has 
skin diseases. Consult physician as to suitable 
time. About three weeks will see vaccination 
through; it is rare that it is severe in its effects, 
and in any event you can rest assured that for 
one with which vaccination goes a little hard, small 
pox would have been most severe and particularly 



dangerous, and is therefore all the more fortunate- 
ly averted. 

If vaccination does not take it must be repeated; 
it is very rare that it will not finally succeed. One 
should be revaccinated every six years. If an epi- 
demic of small pox appears every one who has

HOME REMEDIES IN A NUTSHELL 



Cold* for Children — Molasses, stewed, with 
castor oil added, is palatable and an excellent first 
aid remedy. 

Poultices — Wormwood and arnica for sprains 
and bruises. Steep the herbs in water; add corn- 
meal to thicken. 

Linseed — Stir it into hot water — for infiamma- 
tion. 

Hop Poultice — Boil hops in hot water, add corn- 
meal, mustard and ginger. 

Bread and Milk Poultice — To make a bread 
poultice break a quantity of coarse bread crumbs, 
not crusts, in a heated bowl and cover ^vith boiling 
water. Place a plate over the bowl till the water 
has been soaked up by the bread; strain off the 
water and put the water-soaked bread in a flannel 
bag. 

Emergency Flash Light — Keep a small flash light 
hung on the inside of the door to your medicine 
cabinet, and use it to prevent taking of wrong 
medicine by mistake. It is also far more conven- 
ient than turning on and off electric lights as one 
moves around the house at night waiting on one 
who is sick — and less likely to disturb or wake the 
patient. 

Accidents Disinfectants In the last analysis, 

disinfectant washes simmer down principally to 
three: iodine, lysol, and hot water — especially hot 
water. One should have on hand always iodine 
and lysol, vsrith apparatus for making water hot 
at once. We might add carron oil, for burns. 

A Stopper Hint — When putting a stopper into 
a bottle always give it a half turn round after it is 
in. This will prevent it from sticking. 

Back and Chest Plaster — For backache and pain 
in the chest a belladonna and capsicum plaster is 
advisable; can be obtained at all drug stores. 

Mustard a Cure-All — Mustard is the nearest ap- 
proach to a univerasl cure-all. Fevir pains will 
not give way before a mustard plaster, and a wide 
range of internal inflammations from colds and 
other causes may be stopped by its timely appli- 
cation. It is the first best resort in threatened 
pneumonia, congestion of the lungs or undeter- 
mined cold on the chest. 

A Mustard Ointment is made as follows; three 
tablespoonfuls of mutton tallow, 2 tablespoonfuls 
of goose or hen's oil, I tablespoonful of spirits of 
camphor, 2 tablespoonfuls of ammonia, I table- 
spoonful of ground mustard; mix and put in a 
covered glass jar. 

Rub over the lungs and throat or on any sprain 
or hurt when the skin is not broken. 



The Efficient Borax — Borax is an efficient and 
ever-present remedy for many ills, and owing to 
its inexpensiveness, it is within the reach of the 
housewife of most limited means. Applied locally 
on linen, it has been found to be a remarkable 
cure for erysipelas; for catarrhal difficulties it will 
give relief if snuffed in the nostrils, making a 
solution of one dram of borax to one-half pint of 
soft water; as a gargle it benefits sore throats; for 
weak and inflamed eye* it proves desirable as a 
wash. 

Cure for Fever Blisters — Carbolic acid, 6 drops; 
glycerine, I teaspoonful; rosewater, 10 drops. 

Ivy Poisoning — Tansy tea, made good and 
strong; wash affected parts frequently, and drink 
some three or four times a day. Make it nice and 
fresh for every drink. It is blood cooling and 
purifying and it makes one less susceptible to the 
poison. 

Macaroni "Straw" — A stick of macaroni will 
serve in place of a glass tube for a patient who can- 
not sit up to drink, or will sometimes induce a 
child to drink its milk when otherwise it would 
not. 

Oranges and Lemons — Oranges possess a spe- 
cial value in lung diseases, the acid (citrate of 
potash) tending to prevent pneumonia. They are 
a good laxative, if three or four are taken daily. 
They are said to destroy the craving for alcoholic 
stimulants. 

Lemons contain citric acid, which combines with 
alkalis and circulates in the blood as alkaline salts. 
Hence lemons make blood and urine less acid, or 

rather more alkaline blood never becomes acid 

in life. 

For Over-Fatigue — Hot milk heated to as high 
a temperature as it can be drunk is a most re- 
freshing stimulant in cases of cold or over-fatigue. 
Its action is very quick and grateful. It gives 
real strength as well as acting as a food. 

Court Plaster — Before using a piece of court 
plaster prick it all over with a fine needle. This 
prevents the usual unpleasant drawing sensation. 

To Prevent a Blue Bruise If sweet oil is ap- 
plied to the skin after a blov^ or bruise it will not 
turn black and blue. 

Castor Oil for Wounds Castor oil is an ad- 
mirable dressing for slight abrasions, burns and 
minor wounds. First wash wound with some anti- 
septic solution or paint with tincture of iodine 
and then cover with gauze saturated with castor 
oil.

Sugar and Salt for Wounds — Sugar is used as 
a dressing for infected wounds on the European 
battle fields, and with good results. The British 
Government has found that wounded men on ships, 
whose injuries have been washed with common 
sea water, make better recoveries than those treat- 
ed in field hospitals, the conclusion being that the 
salt waters of the ocean are an ideal antiseptic. 

Ptomaine Poisoning — Treatment: Castor oil, at 
first; starvation; heat applied to abdomen to relieve 
pain; more castor oil, at last. 

Garlic for Wounds — Garlic applied to a wound 
stops the infection and heals quickly, whereas 
many modern antiseptics used in fashionable prac- 
tice injure the tissues. Garlic has been tested thor- 
oughly at the Paddington Infirmary in London, 
England, as well as in field hospitals in France. 

An old French peasant woman was found to 
have dressed the sores and wounds of soldiers 
in the war zone with remarkable results. An army 
surgeon investigated, and garlic is now sold by 
the ton where it was formerly sold by the ounce 
in English chemists' shops. Garlic juice, diluted 
with three or four parts of distilled water, seems to 
be the standard dressing. 

Ointment for Eczema — Pulverized zinc oxide 
and amyl, J/2 ounce each, vaseline, 1 ounce; for 
local use. Apply to parts affected and wrap 
with a cloth. Wear rubber coat or kid fingers 
from gloves. Do not bathe eczema spots for 
three days after applying paste, but keep spots cov- 
ered well with paste. 

For a Burn — Apply equal parts of white of egg 
and olive oil mixed together, then cover with a 
piece of old linen. 

Or hold burned portion of the skin over heat. 

Or apply at once cooking soda, then cover with 
cloth and keep same wet with cold water. 

Nose Bleed — When the nose is bleeding never 
hold it over a basin or hold the head down in 
any way. This only causes further rush of blood 
to the broken tissue in the nose. The head should 
be held up and back, the flow being caught in a 
handkerchief or cloth. 

One of the most effective and simple means of 
checking nose-bleed is to press on the upper lip. 
Near the under surface of the lip runs the artery 
that supplies the interior nasal passages where 
the ruptures occur. If this is pressed, the flow 
of blood is mechanically checked, thus allowing 
the blood around the broken tissues to congeal and 
seal up the opening. 

If merely pressing with the finger does not suc- 
ceed, place a wad of paper under the lip and fold 
the lip over it, holding it down tight. 



As a further remedy for nose bleeding, if pro- 
longed, a little powdered alum may be placed 
within the nostrils. Above all, absolute rest and 
quiet is enjoined. Do not blow the nose at any 
cost. Allow the blood to fill up the nostrils and 
wait for the coagulation to occur. The overflow 
will undoubtedly find its way into the mouth, which 
may easily be cleared away. 

There is always a cause for nose bleeding, and 
a specialist should be consulted for correct diag- 
nosis and condition treated. Cases of nose bleed- 
ing are on record that could not be controlled, 
resulting in exsanguination. 

Bran Baths for Nervousness — One of the best 
aids for the nervous woman who is trying to re- 
duce her fractious nerves, is the bran bath just be- 
fore retiring at night. This not only has a sooth- 
ing effect, but incidentally softens and whitens the 
skin. 

To make the bath, buy ordinary bran at a feed 
store and keep it in a tin box away from mice. 
Make a bag of cheesecloth, from 1 2 to 18 inches 
square, and stuff it with bran until about as full 
as a pine pillow. This bag is put in a bathtub 
half filled with warm water, and squeezed until 
the water is bro^vn and bubbly. It is not well 
to remain in the water longer than five or six 
minutes; if possible, the bather should rest ten 
minutes and then be massaged. If there is no one 
to do the massaging rub the body thoroughly 
with a rough towel or knead it with the hands. 

Insomnia Remedies — There are two very simple 
but effective remedies for the kind of sleeplessness 
that comes from overwork or nervous exhaustion. 
One is to have the feet very warm. Put them 
against a rubber bag filled with hot water, >vhich 
is better than an earthen bottle as it will retain 
the heat for hours. The second method is sim- 
pler. Discard the pillow, turn over and lie on 
the stomach with hands clasped under the fore- 
head to lift the head a trifle. This will often send 
one to sleep. 

When you are tired and nervous, a good rubbing 
all over the body with the following lotion will be 
very restful; diluted alcohol six ounces, cologne 
water six ounces, tannin ten grains. Lie quietly in 
bed after the rubbing for half an hour. 

The Tired Feeling — Much fatigue, otherwise 
not readily accounted for, is unquestionably owing 
to over-eating, especially of protein foods such as 
beans, cheese, etc., which do not fully digest and 
consequently leave poisons in the system. 

To Reduce Superfluous Flesh — Deep breathing 
is essential and may be practiced almost anywhere 
in the open air, although of course you can obtain 
the greatest benefit from this exercise when you 
can wear a loose garment that will allow absolute

405 



freedom of the muscles. When practicing deep 
breathing indoors stand by an open window and 
accompany your breathing with a simple arm ex- 
ercise. 

The process of reducing by means of exercise i» 
a far saner method than that of using hot baths. 



for the exercise strengthens the muscles and may 
be applied to only those parts of the anatomy that 
need the treament; while the baths reduce the 
weight of the entire body and have no strengthen- 
ing effect.

HYGIENE and 




THE PERSON 



THE HUMAN MACHINE 

(Iowa State College Bulletin No. 3) 

THE CELL 

The unit of the body is the single cell, the knowledge of which 
need not be entirely through the imagination, as a close counterpart of 
this unit cell exists in nature. The school boy, who explores the con- 
f^ ^ tents of the stagnant pool, sometimes gathers one of these microscopic 

V^^ cells into his tin can w^hich he uses to scoop up pollywogs from 

the pond. He does not see the cell until his teacher puts a drop 
of water under the microscope. Sometimes after doing this she sees a little jelly-like 
mass under the cover glass. This mass moves about and presently after stretch- 
ing out a portion of itself into an arm-like shape, it gathers in a morsel of food. The 
jelly-like mass, called the ameba, is the lowest form of animal life and closely re- 
sembles one single cell of the body. 

The one cell of the ameba performs all the necessary functions of its life 
processes. It must in turn act as arms, means of locomotion, and digestive sys- 
tem. The results are elementary, because the facilities for work are most elemen- 
tary. There are no specialized forces and consequently no high type of life. The 
human body occupies a position of the strongest contrast to this simple one-celled 
creature and it owes its high position in the scale of life, to the fact that there is 
every provision for specialized activities and for perfect cooperation between the 
organs that perform those activities. The millions of cells that make up the body 
are so formed, so grouped and so related as to fit each cell and each class of cells 
for its special work. 

POSITION AND STRUCTURE OF ORGANS 

Body Cavities — The body is divided into two cavities by means of a tough membrane 
called the diaphragm. The upper cavity is called the thorax. The lower cavity is called 
the abdominal cavity. 

I. Organs of Respiration 

These organs are located entirely within the chest cavity or thorax. 

The thorax is lined with muscles which have an inner lining of a delicate membrane 
called the pleura. 

407 



408 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK — Section VIII — Personal Hygiene and Person 



TTie trachea is a tube which connects the nasal passages with the lungs. It is made 
up of a series of cartilaginous rings which are connected by means of muscles. 

The right and left bronchi branch from the lower end of the trachea to the right and 
left lung. The bronchi are like the trachea in structure and they, with their many branches, 
form a net work of tubes through the lungs. Each tube leads to a small cell or air chamber. 
The spaces between the tubes and air cells are filled in by connective tissue, which joins all 
parts of the lungs into a spongy mass of tissue. The whole is given stability by the tough 
cartilage in the bronchi that extend through the lungs. 

II. Organs of Digestion 

The digestive system begrins with the teeth and extends through the entire body. It is 
really one long tube called the alimentary canal. The chief subdivisions of the system are, 
mouth, stomach, intestines. 

The mouth consists of lips, teeth, tongue and palate (roof of the mouth). The mouth 
leads directly into the pharynx, which lies directly back of the trachea. The pharynx is 
the upper part of the long tube called the oesophagus. The oesophagus is connected vrith the 
pharynx at its upper extremity and with the stomach at its lower extremity. The oesoph- 
agus is a muscular tube. It is located midway between the right and left side of the body 
lies directly back of the trachea. 

The stomach is a muscular bag lined wth a mucous membrane. It lies directly below 
the diaphragm and to the left side of the body. 

The mucous membrane which lines the stomach contains many glands which supply 
the digestive fluids. The capacity of the stomach is about three pints. 

The narrower end of the stomach joins the small intestine at the right side of the 
body, directly back of the liver. This opening of the stomach into the intestines is called 
the pylorus. 

The small intestine is a tube-like organ composed of muscle and lined with a delicate 
membrane. It occupies the middle portion of the abdominal cavity and lies directly below 
the stomach. The many folds of the small intestines are attached to the body wall by 
means of a membrane called the mesentery. 

The small intestines join the large intestines at the lower part of the abdominal cav- 
ity on the right side of the body. The appendix is attached just below this point. 

The large intestine extends up the right side, across the abdominal cavity, just below 
the stomach and down the left side of the abdominal cavity. 

The mucous lining of the intestines contains glands which produce digestive fluids. 

TTie pancreas and liver are glands which supply digestive fluids, which are poured into 
the intestines. These fluids and their uses will be studied in a following lesson. 

III. Organs of Circulation 

The heart is a muscular organ located in the central part of the chest cavity, between 
the lungs. It is slightly nearer to the left than the right side of the body. It is just above 
the diaphragm. 

The heart consists of right and left sides, which are entirely separate compartments. 
Each side consists of a large chamber called the ventricle and a small chamber called the 
auricle. The ventricles are provided with a very strong muscular wall. 

The valves are little trap doors which control the direction of the flow of blood. They 
are located between the auricles and ventricles and between the ventricles and arteries. 

The arteries are muscular tubes that carry blood from the heart to all organs of the 
body. The veins are muscular tubes that carry blood from the organs to the heart. TTie 
veins have little pocket-like valves. 



PERSONAL HYGIENE AND PERSON— THE HUMAN MACHINE 409 

IV. Organs of Excretion 

The skin, which covers the entire body, is composed of three layers: The outer layer, 
called the epidermis, is the tough, protective layer. The second layer, or dermis, contains 
the blood vessels which feed the skin. The under layer consists of a loose tissue and con- 
tains the glands which secrete the perspiration. This secretion is conducted to the surface 
of the skin by means of tubes that extend from the gland to the surface of the skin and 
deposit the secretion through the pores of the skin. 

The lungs are active as excretory organs. Their structure has been considered under 
respiration. 

The kidneys are bean-shaped glands. The center of the kidney is a basin called the 
pelvis. Opening into this pelvis are great numbers of ducts which end in small cavities 
which secrete the urine. The secretion is carried by the ducts to the pelvis of the kidney, 
and from the pelvis through a long tube called the ureter to the urinary bladder. 

The intestines are provided with a strong layer of muscles which contract and force 
the wastes from th* body. This makes the intestines very important organs of excretion. 

V. Protection 

The skin covers the delicate parts of the body and prevents the entrance of harmful 
material and organisms. 

The bony frame work of the body gives the body its shape and stability and protects 
the delicate organs from injury. 

The bone is fed by means of a tough covering called the periosteum. This membrane 
contains many blood vessels which feed the bone through its spongy surface. The process 
of feeding is aided by the fact that the bones are hollow and are filled with marrow. The 
bone is provided with a system of canals or tubes which conduct food throughout the en- 
tire bone. 

The organs of the chest cavity are protected by the spine, ribs, clavicle, sternum and 
scapula. 

The spine consists of 33 bones called vertebrae. These bones are separated by masses 
of spongy bones. They are bound together by strong tissue called ligaments. The ribs are 
flexible bones which have the front ends attached to the sternum and the back ends at- 
tached to the spine. 

The scapula is the broad, flat bone called the shoulder blade. 

The clavicle is the collar bone. It is attached to the sternum in front and to the sca- 
pula at the back. 

The brain and other organs of the head are protected by the skull which is made up of 
separate bones. The frontal occupies the front part of the head, the two temporal bones 
are directly above and back of the ears, the occipital bone is located between and below the 
temporal bones, the two parietal bones are located between the temporal bones and above 
the occipital bones. 

The organs of the abdominal cavity are protected by the spine, the ribs and the pelvis. 
The pelvis is a strong arch-shaped bone. It is attached to the spine. It curves up and to- 
ward the front, forming a sort of basin which supports the organs of the abdominal cavity. 

The nervous system sends its branches to every part of the body and serves as pro- 
tection because it gives warning of danger. The blind man feels the presence of the stove 
through the nerves of sensation, and avoids being burned. 

VI. Organs of Stimulation 

The chief organ of stimulation is the brain. The brain consists of a fore-brain called 
the cerebrum and the hind-brain. The hind-brain is made up of the cerebellum which is 
at the extreme back of the head, the pons varoii, which is directly under the cerebellum 



410 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK — Section VIII — Personal Hygiene and Person 

and the medulla oblongata, which joins the spinal cord. The medulla oblongata is also 
known as the bulb. 

The outer covering of the brain is a tough membrane which conforms to the many 
convolutions of the brain. These convolutions are a striking example of the economy of 
nature. Much of the brain surface has been stored away in the skull because of these con- 
volutions. 

The spinal cord is a tube having thick, protective walls. It is composed of white and 
gray matter just as the brain is. The spinal cord joins the brain just below the bulb (or 
medulla oblongata) and occupies the central cavity of the spinal column. The spinal column 
protects this delicate organ from injury. The spinal cord sends out nerve branches to all 
parts of the body. 

VII. Organs of Activity 

Motion — The bones of the body are so constructed as to aid motion. The fact that 
they are hollow makes them light, gives them added strengrth, and prevents shock to the 
organs of the body. 

The bones are provided with joints to suit each purpose. The head is attached by a 
pivot joint, because it is necessary to turn the head in all directions. The elbow has a com- 
bination of hinge and pivot joints. 

The upper arm and the upper leg are attached by ball and socket jonts which allow 
them to move freely. Hinge joints, which allow free motion backward and forward, are 
located at the wrist, knee and ankle. 

The joints are held in position by means of tough cords called tendons. 

The bones are covered with layers of tough muscle that contract and expand when they 
are stimulated by the nerves w^hich lie within the muscles. 

Speech — The larynx is the upper end of the trachea. It is composed of tough walls 
of cartilage. The vocal cords are tough muscular cords which are stretched across the lar- 
ynx. As the air is forced over these cords, they are caused to vibrate. The vibration causes 
the sound. The hard palate acts as a sounding board and intensifies this sound. The mus- 
cles of the lips and tongue contract and help to formulate the sound into speech. The teeth 
help to retain the sound, and are an aid in the process of speech. 

VIII. Organs of Sensation 

Sight — The eye is protected by a tough outer coat called the sclerotic coat. This is 
seen in the white of the eye. The inner coat called the choroid contains blood vessels 
which nourish the eye. It also contains black pig^ment whcih prevents the entrance of light 
except through the cornea. 

The cornea is the front part of the eye ball. This part of the eye is covered with the 
sclerotic coat and is transparent. It is not covered with the choroid coat. The choroid coat 
is folded back to form the iris which is the colored part of the eye. The opening in the 
iris is called the pupil which allows the rays of light to enter the eye. The pupil is pro- 
vided with muscles which contract when light is too strong. This is one of Nature's plans 
for protecting the eye. 

Directly back of the pupil of the eye, there is a lens which helps to bring the rays of 
light to a focus. The portion of the eye in front of the lens is filled with a fluid called the 
aqueous humor. The portion of the eye back of the lens is filled with a liquid called the 
vitreous humor. These liquids act with the lens in bringing the rays of light to a focus. 

The inner coat of the eye is called the retina. It contains the fibres of the optic nerve 
and is the sensitive plate for the rays of light. The optic nerve branches out from the re- 
tina and connects with the visual center of the brain. 

Hearing — The sense of hearing is due to the vibration of sound waves upon the tympa- 
num which is a tough membrane that is stretched across the opening between the outer and 



PERSONAL HYGIENE AND PERSON— THE HUMAN MACHINE 411 

inner ear. The outer ear collects the sound waves and conducts them to the tympanum and 
then on into the inner ear. 

The inner ear consists of a chamber which contains three small bones called the anvil, 
stirrup and hammer. Sound waves are picked up by this chain of bones and carried through 
a sort of spiral chamber to the cochlea. The inner ear stands in relation to sound just as the 
retina does to sight. It is the sensitive surface that picks up the sound waves and conducts 
them to the auditory nerve. The fibers of the auditory nerve He in the inner ear and branch 
out into the auditory nerve which is connected with the brain. 

The eustachian tube connects the inner ear with the pharynx. 

Smell and Taste — The nerves of taste end in little papillae, which give the rough ap- 
pearance to the tongue. The sense of taste is conducted to the brain by the stimulation of 
the papillae and by means of the nerves of taste. 

The nerves of smell end in the same way in the nasal passages and produce the sense 
of smell. 

Position — Some physiologists consider that the sense of position is due to the fact that 
the controlling nerves end in the semi-circular canal of the ear. The change in the position 
of the fluid in this canal stimulates the connecting nerve and causes the sensation of changed 
positions. 

Hunger and Thirst, Cold and Heat — These sensations are due to the bodily conditions 
that exist at the nerve ending. The sensation is carried by the nerve to the brain. 

The structure of the body illustrates most clearly the value of specialized working 
forces which are perfectly cooperative and thoroughly organized into one powerful whole. 

THE RUNNING OF THE MACHINE 
1. Digestion of Food 

A dinner may consist of roast beef, potatoes, bread and butter, plum pudding and tea. 
How is that food digested, or in other words, changed in such a way that it can become 
a part of the body? 

In this study of digestion, begin with the bread and let that represent the whole class 
of starchy foods. The principal foods in this class are potatoes, corn, rice, cereal foods of 
all kinds, all kinds of flour and foods mjide from them, peas and beans. 

Digestion in the Mouth — The bread is thoroughly masticated by the teeth. This breaks 
it into fine particles and makes it easily dissolved. The salivary glands, which are located 
below the jaw bones and near the ears, manufacture the saliva and deposit it in the mouth. 
The flow of saliva is increased by the thorough mastication and is also stimulated by the 
flavor of the food. 

The saliva contains water which moistens the food and a substance called ptyalin which 
changes the starch to dextrine. The change to dextrine is the first step in the change of 
starch to sugar. There is a slight change to maltose. 

Digestion in the Stomach — The bread passes into the stomach and the digestion con- 
tinues until the bread becomes mixed with the acid of the stomach. After that starch can- 
not be digested in the stomach. TTiere is very little digestion of starch in the stomach. 

Digestion in the Intestines — The bread passes from the stomach into the intestines, where 
it is acted upon by the amylopsin of the pancreatic juice. The juice is poured into the in- 
testines from the gland called the pancreas. The amylopsin changes the starchy part of the 
bread to a substance called maltose. The maltose is acted upon by the intestinal juices and 
changed to glucose and fructose, in which form it is found in the blood. 

The slice of bread has been acted upon by the teeth, saliva, amylopsin and intestinal 
juice and has now entered the blood circulation. As the glucose passes into the liver, a 
portion of it is stored away for future use in the form of glycogen. Glycogen is also stored 



4 1 2 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK — Section VIll— Personal Hygiene and Person 

in the muscles and white blood corpuscles. This supply acts as a reserve source of heat 
and is g^ven out in the blood stream as needed. 

The dinner suggested provided roast beef. Its digestion will be considered in the 
same way. The digestion oi the roast beef represents the process of digestion for all pro- 
tein. The chief protein-giving foods are lean meat, eggs, cheese, milk, fish, peas, beans, 
macaroni. 

Digestion in the Mouth — The beef is thoroughly masticated by the teeth and is soft- 
ened by the saliva. The saliva has no power to digest protein. 

Digestion in the Stomach — The stomach is provided with a digestive fluid called gas- 
tric juice. The gastric juice consists of hydrochloric acid, pepsin and rennin. The acid acts 
as an antiseptic and helps to counteract the effect of harmful substances that may have en- 
tered the stomach. The rennin changes the protein of milk into a curd. Gastric juice as a 
whole is only slightly active in the digestion of protein. It does change protein to proteose 
and peptone, but only slightly. The stomach is more a storehouse for food that is waiting 
to enter the intestine, than a means of digesting food. The chief purpose of the gastric 
juice is to aid in digesting protein, converting proteids into peptones, a substance easily 
assimilable to the blood stream. 

Digestion in the Intestines — TTie pancreatic juice is a strong alkaline fluid. The action 
of the ferment called amylopsin has been studied in the digestion of the slice of bread. The 
ferment called trypsin is the active ferment in digesting protein. The mass of food which 
enters the intestine from the stomach is strongly acid. The ferment trypsin cannot act in 
an acid medium, but the strong alkali of the pancreatic juice is sufficient to neutralize the acid 
at once. The trypsin acts upon the protein and changes it to peptone and proteose. The 
pancreatic juice is aided by the intestinal juice in preparing peptones and proteose for the 
blood. The ferment of the intestinal juice breaks up the peptones and proteoses into sim- 
pler forms. The digested protein foods are taken by the cells in the form of amino acids. 

The butter and the fat of the plum pudding in the suggested dinner are digested by 
means of ferments, not yet considered, and the action of these ferments will be studied 
next. The chief fatty foods are butter, cream, olive oil, cheese and fat meats. 

Digestion in the Mouth — Fatty foods are thoroughly masticated and moistened in the 
mouth, but no digestion takes place there. 

Digestion in the Stomach — The fatty foods pass into the stomach and are stored there 
until they pass into the intestines; but very little digestion takes place. Fats are slightly 
emulsified in the stomach and stomach lipase has slight action upon fat. 

Digestion in the Intestines — The pancreatic juice contains a ferment called lipase. This 
ferment has the power to change fats into fatty acids and glycerin. It also splits the fat into 
small globules, making an emulsion of the fatty mass. The contents of the intestine are 
alkaline and the fatty acids combines with the alkali, making a soapy mixture very simi- 
lar to the soap which is made by heating fat and lye together.

2. Assbnilation of Food 

The process of digestion has changed the food into soluble form which can be ab- 
sorbed by the tissues. The next step in the feeding of the body is the absorption of these 
foods. This takes place almost entirely in the small intestine. The surface of the small 
intestine is provided with microscopic tube-like projections called villi. The villi absorb the 
food and through the villi it is conducted into the circulation of the blood. 

Starch and Sugar — After starch and sugar are digested, they are absorbed and enter 
the blood as glucose. They are taken to the liver and a portion of them stored as glyco- 
gen. This supply of glycogen is given out into the blood from time to time, in the form of 
glucose. The glucose must be carried to each cell of the body and become a part of each 
cell of the body before the body receives any benefit from it. As the oxygen in the cell 
combines with the food, the blood becomes a part of the cell or is assimilated. As this proc- 
ess takes place, a gas called carbondioxide is formed. This gas is a waste that is disposed 
of by means of the lungs. 

Protein — The digested protein is absorbed by the villi of the small intestine and poured 
into the blood. The protein was changed to peptone by the gastric juice in cooperation with 
the tripsin in the pancreatic juice. The erepsin of the intestinal juice breaks the peptone 
into simpler substances which can be safely taken into the blood. 

Steps in Digestion of Protein — Proteose, peptone, peptid, amino acid. 

Fat — The digested fat is absorbed from the small intestine by means of tube-like ves- 
sels called lacteals. From the lacteals the digested fat enters the blood circulation. 

3. Circulation 

The blood is the medium for carrying food to all parts of the body and for removing 
wastes from the body. 

Structure of the Blood — The blood consists of red blood corpuscles, white blood cor- 
puscles and a fluid called plasma. The red blood corpuscles carry oxygen to the tissues of 
the body by means of the hemoglobin which they contain. The white blood corpuscles 
have a number of uses, but they are chiefly of value in removing poison from the blood. 
For this reason they are active in healing a wound. The plasma is the fluid part of the 
blood and is 90 per cent water. 

The heart is a pump which forces the blood through the body. (Study structure of 
heart in Lesson I.) 

The veins open into the auricles. The arteries open into the ventricles. (Study veins, 
arteries, auricles and ventricles in Lesson I.) It will be well to secure the heart of some ani- 
mal and to locate these organs. 

The flow of blood is regulated by means of the two sets of valves. There is a valve 
between each auricle and its connecting ventricle. There is also a valve between each ven- 
tricle and its connecting artery. 

Course of Blood — To study this take the circulation at some given point and trace the 
blood back to that point. Beginning with the left auricle, the blood flows into the left ven- 
tricle. The valve prevents the backward flow into the auricle. From the left ventricle, cer- 
tain branches of the aorta feed the head, neck, shoulders and arms. Other branches feed the 
organs of the pelvic cavity and the legs. From these organs the blood is carried by the 
veins to the right auricle, from the right auricle to the right ventricle, from the right ventri- 
cle through the lungs, from the lungs to the left auricle, from the left auricle to the Irft 
ventricle, and then it takes the same course through the body again. 



414 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK — Section VIII — Personal Hygiene and Person 

Important — The blood which leaves the left ventricle to pass through and feed the or- 
gans of the body never reaches the left ventricle again until it has passed through the lungs. 
The lungs are the repair station for the blood. They supply the blood with fresh oxygen 
and provide an outlet for impurities. 

The nervous system stimulates the action of the muscles of the heart and thus regu- 
lates the system of circulation. The perfection of the heart action depends primarily upon 
the healthy, normal condition of the nervous system. 

4. Respiration 

The nasal passages are provided for the entrance of air into the lungs. If the air is 
taken in through the mouth, it is an indication that there is an obstruction in the nasal pas- 
sage, or that an improper method of breathing has become habitual. 

The lining of the nasal passages is covered with a hair-line growth called cilia. This 
sieve formed by the cilia helps to strain out the dust and other injurious substances and pro- 
vides a strong argument in favor of proper habits of breathing. 

The air passes from the nasal passages to all parts of the lungs, if deep, full breaths are 
taken. Proper breathing means that the ribs and the diaphragm are exercised. This can- 
not happen if the clothing is too tight. This will not happen unless the attention is called 
to the importance of long, deep breathing. It is the function of the process of respiration 
to remove the impure air from the lungs, to introduce pure air and to strengthen the controll- 
ing muscles by means of exercise. The fulfillment of this function of the body and upon a 
sufficient amount of pure air to breathe. 

Nature demands that we: 

1 . Breathe deeply, exercise ribs and diaphragm. 

2. Breathe through nostrils. 

3. Hold chest high. 

4. Hold shoulders dow^n and back. 

5. Do not handicap ribs and diaphragm by tight clothing (belts and corsets). 

6. Ventilate sleeping and living rooms. 

7. Ventilate school room. 

8. Ventilate church, lecture room, office room, factory and railway train. 

Note — Ventilate means — Provide means for the entrance of pure air and the exit of 
impure air. 

5. Excretion 

Food is taken into the body. It is acted upon by ferments and so digested. The di- 
gested portion is taken into the blood and carried to the cells of the body. These processes 
leave waste matters that interfere with the working of the organs of the body, very much 
as soot and ashes interfere with the working of a heating plant. 

Nature has foreseen this condition and has amply provided the body with means of re- 
moving these wastes. (Study organs of excretion. Lesson I.) 

The surface of the skin is covered with pores that are the opening of tube-like ducts 
that leads to the perspiratory glands in the under tissues of the skin. These glands gather 
poisonous wastes and pour them out upon the surface of the skin (chiefly carbon dioxide). 
The perspiration collected by these glands consists of water and solid matter. The evapora- 
tion of the water removes heat from the body. 

The skin and the kidneys work hand in hand. If the skin is suddenly chilled, the ac- 
tion of perspiratory glands is retarded and the kidneys become overworked. If the skin 
does its duty the kidneys are relieved. (Study structure of kidneys in Lesson I.) 

The tubules of the kidneys gather waste substances from the blood and deposit them 
into the basin of the kidney. From this it is discharged through the urinary bladder. 



PERSONAL HYGIENE AND PERSON— THE HUMAN MACHINE 415 



The amount of secretion from the kidneys is increased by the use of proteins, the use 
of water, and by exposure to cold. Water acts as a solvent for the solid constituents of 
the urine, for that reason an abnormally great secretion of urine removes too much water 
from the kidneys and thus prevents the solution of the solids in the urine. 

The lungs act as organs of excretion in that they remove carbon dioxide and other 
substances which are waste products after digestion and assimilation have been completed. 
(Study respiration. Lesson II.) 

The intestines remove the waste of digestion. The regularity and thoroughness of their 
work depend upon the care of the body. 

Foods: Foods containing cellulose give bulk to the food and help to strengthen the 
muscular lining of the intestines, because they force the muscles to push in order to force the 
food through the body. Foods like lettuce, celery, cabbage, cauliflower, onions, prunes, dates 
and rhubarb are laxative because of their bulk. Other foods like cream, butter, olive oil 
and fat meats are laxative because they are lubricants. Exercise and ample amount of 
water and massage are also important in promoting the proper excretory function of the 
intestine. 

The body is so wisely planned that the cells are able to render harmless a certain 
amount of the poisonous wastes of the body and each of these organs in the excretory sys- 
tem have an important function to perform. Nature has planned so well that a little com- 
mon sense habitually made use of in attention to diet, ventilation, exercise, sleep, rest, cloth- 
ing and power of relaxation would make aches and pains strangers to the human family. 
Take care of the excretory organs. Give the body a thorough cleansing by means of them. 

CARE OF THE MACHINE 

The essentials of success in the management of any machine are, thorough knowledge 
of its parts and their uses, an appreciation of its value, a thorough understanding of the 
results of harmful treatment and an active conscience concerning the care of the machine. 
These essentials of success apply most vitally to the care of the human machine. Disease 
is not an accident, but failure, with reference to some of these essentials. 

This lesson will give some definite suggestion concerning the care of each system of 
the body. 

1. Organs of Digestion 

Plan the meals wisely. Make them provide the body with just food enough to sus- 
tain the body, not to destroy it. Make them provide foods to suit the age, occupation, 
climate and condition of system. Make them represent a wise amount of each of the five 
principles. (Study lesson on foods.) 

Masticate food thoroughly. This increases the flow of the digestive fluids and renders 
the food more soluble when mixed with the digestive fluids. 

Do not eat when excited, angry, anxious or over-tired. 

Experiment — A scientist introduced a piece of metal into the digestive tract of a dog 
and then studied its progress ■With an X-ray instrument. The metal was seen to move 
through the system very easily until the dog was made angry. At that the metal ceased 
to move. The dog was soothed and the metal moved on as at first. This illustrated the 
ill effect of overwrought feelings upon the process of digestion. 

Do not eat highly seasoned foods. Seasonings are a stimulant to the nerves of taste 
and are of value if used moderately. They also stimulate the flow of digestive fluids and 
so are of value if used moderately. The overuse of seasonings and spices weakens the nerves 
of taste and the nerves that control the flow of digestive fluids because it makes them work 
harder than nature intended them to work. Do not eat at irregular intervals. Do not eat 



4 1 6 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK — Section VIII — Personal Hygiene and Person 

a heavy meal late at night. Do not eat rich foods frequently. Do not use condensed foods 
like cheese too freely. Do not use iced drinks. Use tea and coffee moderately if at all. 
Do not fill the system with medicine. Let proper diet and proper habits of eating keep 
the body in good working order. 

2. Organs of Circulation 

Perfect circulation carries food to each cell of the body and carries away the waste 
material from each cell of the body. Perfect circulation depends upon: 

a. Exercise in the open air. 

b. Clothing that does not restrict the organs of the body, whether the article of cloth- 

ing be collar, shoes, belt, corset or gloves. 

c. Absence of stimulating foods in the diet, whether it be too much meat, too much 

tea or coffee, or too much of highly seasoned foods. 

d. Sufficient rest and sleep. 

e. Power to keep the nerves under control and thus, to relax the muscles of the 

body. 

f. Sufficient recreation of the proper sort. Recreation is that which recreates, which 

makes as good as new. So-called recreation that does not pass that test should 
not be indulged in. 

3. Organs of Respiration 
The perfect working of these organs depend upon: 

a. Breathing through nasal passages. 

The cilia in the nasal passage sift out the dust and other solid matter that would 
act as an irritant if not as a poison to the throat and lungs. 

b. Habit of taking long, deep breaths. 

This fills each sac of the lungs with pure air and helps to remove impure gas and 
solid matter from the lungs. It also strengthens the muscles that control the 
ribs and strengthens the diaphragm. 

c. The habit of holding the body properly. 

The chest cavity is expanded by holding the chest out, the chin up and the shoul- 
ders down and back. 

d. Attention to good ventilation in homes, school, church, railway train, office and 

factory. 
The air of the room is being filled with impurities from the breath of the occu- 
pants. These impurities are taken back into the system if there is no arrange- 
ment for the exit of impure air and the entrance of pure air. Good ventilation 
is especially needed in the sleeping room and all public places. 

e. Sufficient amount of outdoor exercise. 

4. Organs of Excretion 

a. Care of organs of respiration as discussed in 3. 

b. Care of kidneys. 

A sufficient amount of water is necessary to dissolve the solid matter that accumu- 
lates in the kidneys. 

A moderate use of stimulating foods like meat, tea, coffee, spices and rich foods. 
These are too stimulating to the kidneys. 

A moderate use of sugar and starch is wise. An overuse is one of the causes of 
diabetes. 

Sufficient rest and relaxation; lack of nerve control is one of the causes of dis- 
eased kidneys. 

c. Care of the skin. 

If skin fails to do its work the kidneys are overworked and thus weakened. 



PERSONAL HYGIENE AND PERSON— THE HUMAN MACHINE 417 

d. Protection from cold. 

Severe chilling of the body prevents the skin from doing its work and thus weak- 
ens the kidneys. 

e. Removal of waste through intestines. 

The muscles of the intestines must be strengthened by exercise, just as the outer 
muscles must be strengthened. Foods which contain bulk help to strengthen 
these muscles, because it is necessary to push in order to force these foods 
through the body. Some of these laxative foods are lettuce, celery, radishes, 
onions, green corn, tomatoes, turnips, rhubarb, prunes, figs, dates, apples. Other 
foods are laxative because they are lubricants. These foods are water, butter, 
cream, olive oil, fat meats, molasses and honey. 

Exercise stimulates the action of the intestines. 

Massage strengthens the muscles and stimulates action. 

Regular habits of eating, thorough mastication, moderate use of sweets aids the 
action of the intestines in removing wastes. 

Too great stress cannot be laid upon the importance of the organs of excretion. 
Ample provision has been made by nature, but personal carelessness too often 
causes disease. Wastes that are not removed are reabsorbed by the tissues 
and act as poisons. This condition is made evident by tendency to take cold, 
frequent sore throats, headaches, rheumatism. These and other conditions in- 
dicate a debilitated condition of the system. 

5. The Nervous System 

The proper working of all of the organs of the body depends most vitally upon the 
condition of the nervous system, since all stimulus to activity, whether it be digestion, cir- 
culation, respiration, excretion, sensation or thought, comes from the nervous system. The 
care of the nervous system must, in the first place, take proper food into consideration. 
Foods that are too stimulating, like tea, coffee, meat and highly seasoned foods, should be 
used moderately. 

Fresh air, exercise and sufficient protection from cold help to keep the nervous sys- 
tem in healthy condition. 

The habit of sleeping seven or eight hours each night is of prime importance. 

The habit of working earnestly at something that is thoroughly worth while, for at 
least 9 hours a day, helps to keep the nerves in good condition if this work is followed by 
periods of recreation of some sort. 

The habit of nerve control is absolutely essential and more easily acquired when the 
other points mentioned have been earnestly regarded. The nerves are delicate organs and 
become weakened if they are constantly kept alert. They must be allowed to relax and to 
rest thoroughly at some time during each day. 

The body is a wonderful mechanism, and like every complicated machine, it must have 
thoroughly intelligent and conscientious care if it is to perform satisfactory work and last 
its full time.

TAKE STOCK OF YOUR LOOKS 

Every woman can be good looking — if she will take as careful stock of her 
looks as she does of her pantry and not neglect the little things. 

Begin with the item of health. Is it "all there?" If not, what is missing? 
Find it and correct it. There are signs or symptoms which will reveal the deficient 
items in every case. Without the health right, one can no more build good to look 
upon than a picture can be wrought by the most skilled artist without the canvas 
upon which to put the pigment. 

Is your breath bad? It may be due to decayed teeth, catarrh, a sluggish con- 
dition in the stomach or the alimentary canal. Your breath may be bad and you 
not know it — you would not catch the odor yourself. Nothing is more offensive 
to those you come near than the whiff of a foul breath, but few friends have the 
courage to tell you of this. If you are occasionally subject to this, find the cause, 
learn to recognize it when it appears — and put a stop to its recurrence. 

The item of indigestion, or constipation, is neglected by far too many of us. 
It is the most fertile cause of many blemishes to good looks, as well as the most 
frequent miscreant of bad breath. It makes for headaches, pimples, muddy com- 
plexion, a general feeling of dullness, an ugly disposition and any number of 
other complaints. 

The remedy at times may be in laxatives; but permanent correction of the condition 
can be found only in exercise, careful eating, and the copious drinking of water, includ- 
ing hot water sipped slowly a half hour before breakfast. The exercise must take the 
form of abdominal movements and massage of the liver and bowels. There are literally 
hundreds of good "health exercise" systems published from time to time in magazines and 
countless are the books printed on the subject. The particular system selected is of less 
importance than that you take up one good, simple system of not too many or too difficult 
movements, then follow it regularly, and put your thought into seeing that the movements 
are gone through with in a way to really exercise the muscles until they are tired (but not 
exhausted) and that you do not in a few days get into the habit of listlesly performing the 
motions without any real muscular "pep." The glass of hot water is a most wonderful 
tonic. Put some lemon juice in it — no sugar — or a pinch of salt if not the lemon. Take it 
as hot as you can. Sip it slowly — don't just drink it down. Do this on rising, before 
dressing, it passes immediately through the stomach, clears the latter of the alkalis or other 
juices left there, and puts it in fresh clear condition to start the day right when the break- 
fast reaches it, and it passes on into the bowels and puts them into fit condition for their 
work. 

After the hot water, take the exercises. After the exercises take your morning bath. 

You are then in literally clean and fit condition, inside and out, to break your fast, and 
start the fresh day with a fresh body. 

Take a glass of cold water just before retiring at night. 

Drink at meals, moderately if you want to, but rather between courses; do not use 
water to "wash down the food." No matter how dry the latter keep it in the mouth until 
the saliva takes care of it. 

Drink copiously between meals — two glasses of cold, not ice cold — ^water, an hour or 
two after each meal. A copious water diet, as above, and a breakfast principally fruit, will 
almost guarantee freedom from constipation and indigestion. Add the exercises for the ab- 

419 



420 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK — Section VIII — Personal Hygiene and Person 

dominal nauscles and massage the liver and bowels, and the guarantee is absolute, unless 
of course the patient is chronically wrong, or persistently indulges other habits or appetites 
that counteract all of his good work through these agencies. 

Continuous daily eating of foods that do not agree with him, dissipation, alcoholic in- 
dulgence, and most especially irregularity in stools — ^which must be rigidly regular at the 
same hours every day — these things, usually -vN-ill cancel the most patient and faithful atten- 
tion to "cures." 

Coated tongue and hot dry lips go with a bad breath and announce also a bad con- 
dition along the alimentary tract 

Dry and yellow skin is usually due to the fact that one does not drink enough water. 

To you who are too stout; cut down on your diet — and cut again, and again — and 
don"t "make up for it" by an occasional big meed, just as you are beginning to feel starved. 
Get out of doors and take lots of exercise. .Avoid sweets, milk, cream, fat meats and es- 
pecially potatoes. Live mainly on lettuce, cabbage, spinach, just a very little of lean meats, 
young onions, celery, tomatoes, and very acid or tart fruits when you take any. Take 
salted toast instead of bread and butter. Cease to give yourself fat making food and you 
will cease creating fat cells. 

But you must really practice self-denial, and stay actually hungry most of the time 
for many weeks until your entire system has become accustomed to the new regime. It is 
astonishing how you will get used to it and get over that constant hunger, if you interest 
yourself in other things than food, and exercise enough. 

The Bath — On the whole, the warm bath, at about bodily temperature — not the hot 
bath, is best for the average individual. It should be followed by colder water — let the 
cold water run into the bath until there is a decided chill to it, then take a quick plunge that 
almost makes you gasp but is not a real shock to the system — then get out and rub your- 
self vigorously with a rough towel until the skin glows. 

The -warm bath opens the pores and cleans you; the colder plunge closes the pores 
and prevents your taking colds easily; the rub starts the circulation and tones up the sys- 
tem, leaving the skin in a glowing, healthful condition. 

The very cold plunge or shower alone, strenuously advocated by many people, is not 
good for the average individual of sedentary habits of life. It is suitable under proper 
conditions for the athlete, or for those who lead a very active life; under certain specflic 
conditions it fits specific cases but it is not ordinarily desirable for the ordinary man. 



BATH, COMPLEXION, FACE AND SKIN 



Bath Bagt are made by filling a thick mualin or 
thin calico bag with two thirds of bran or oatmeal, 
and bits of soap and orris ro<^t, to give a sweet 
savor. Let this soak in the water before entering 
the bath, then make a splendid lather all over the 
skin. Use this only two or three times a week. 
Use a bag only twice; once it sours it does more 
harm than good. 

Good Bran Bags can be purchased from almost 
any druggist. But if you prefer you can make 
them yourself. Mix equal parts of powdered oat- 
meal and bran together and to a pint add half a 
cup of powdered soap. To this add about an 
ounce of powdered orris root. Fill small bags and 
use in the bath. 

Bath Powder — Mix 8 avoirdupois ounces each of 
powdered borax and white castile soap. Per- 
fume with a mixture of oil of lavender flowers, I 
fluid drachm; oil of rosemary, I fluid drachm; oil 
of bergamot, 2 fluid drachms; oil of lemon, 4 fluid 
drachms; oil of cloves, 8 drops. 

Bath Lotion — To wipe over the body with a wet 
cloth as a refreshing lotion; one-half pint of pure 
cologne, two ounces of spirits of camphor, two 
ounces of spirits of ammonia, five ounces of salt, 
and enough boiling water to make a quart. It can 
be rubbed into the skin with the hands, and is par- 
ticularly good to use as a rub after a long ^valk 
or much exercise. Shake bottle before using. 

Care of the Skin — Does your skin look wilted, 
dry and drawn? Are you prematurely old look- 
ing) Do not blame it on hardship, but on your 
own indolence. Probably you seldom wash your 
face clean. Not one ^voman in ten really has a 
clean face. If you think your duty done by a dab 
with a wet cloth night and morning, with possibly 
an extra dab between if you have a social engage- 
ment, then is your face not clean. 

It is not necessary to spend money on getting 
a clean face. Cream lotions and massages are 
desirable; they are not indispensable. 

Use Complexion Brush — A good complexion 
brush with stiff bristles, costing from 75 cents up, 
will last for years if kept sanitary. 

With such a brush and pure soap and water 
one can get beneath the upper layer of oil into 
the underlying tsisues, and the dead, wilted look 
will disappear with the increased circulation in- 
duced. 

Do not wash with hard ■water. If your water has 
lime in it or if filtered with alum see that it is 
softened with a pinch of borax, soda, or a drop 
or two of benzoin. 

You may not be able to afford skin foods and 
massage creams but you can fill small bags of 



cheese cloth with oatmeal or barley and use them 
once a day on the face. 

Perhaps costly lotions for cleaning the skin are 
not for you; but skim milk is cheap and effective, 
so also is a wash basin filled with lukewarm "water 
in which a potato or slices of lemon have been 
soaked. 

Some complexions will not "accept** soap and 
water, others cannot endure oil cosmetics. There 
is as much difference between complexions as there 
is between digestion — what is food for one is poison 
for another. As a general rule for the average 
skin, the soap and water bath at night is of great 
benefit. To retire with the dust and grime of the 
day remaining on one's countenance is to treat 
one's face to insult. 

Simple Beauty Rules — If the girl with the bilious 
yellow complexion and dark circles under the eyes, 
and the one whose chest is undeveloped from im- 
proper breathing and habitual stooping, and the 
one whose eyes are dull from perhaps a half dozen 
reasons, would follov? some simple hygienic rules 
in their own homes instead of putting their money 
into things "guaranteed to remove every blemish," 
or bust developers or patent lotions, eye bright- 
eners — there would be more pretty girls and fewer 
quack beauty parlors. 

Here are a few simple rules of beauty and hy- 
giene: 

First — A daily bath, or at least a sponge followed 
by a good brisk rubbing. 

Second — Five minutes spent in deep breathing 
exercises. 

Third — Five minutes exercise or massage for 
the liver. 

Fourth — Eight glasses of water a day two 

when you get up, two during the morning, two 
during the afternoon, and two before you go to 
sleep. 

Fifth — Seven or more hours of sleep in a room 
with open windows. 

Sixth — Persistent cheerfulness. 

Fruit Aids Beauty — Many fruits are appetizing, 
nourishing, refreshing and purifying, besides being 
food of a high order, therefore are of value to 
\vomen in search of beauty. 

Apples, grapes, figs and dates are very nutritious 
and furnish a wholesome ^vay of eating sugar. 
Black grapes and ripe peaches are fattening and 
easily digested when baked and eaten with cream; 
unless the digestion is good they should not be 
eaten raw in connection with farinaceous foods. 
Oranges, lemons, limes, grapes and apples are 
especially good for the complexion. 



421 



422 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK — Section VIII — Personal Hygiene and Person 



Nourishing Cold Cream — Cold creams are like 
soap: that which agrees with one skin may not with 
another. Only by experimenting can one secure 
the mixture that is nourishing. Some persons are 
strong advocates of ^vitch hazel cream, and there 
is no doubt of its efficacy for those with whom it 
agrees. Besides being soothing, it has the virtue 
of bleaching the complexion. 

Fresh Cream — There is a most delightful cream 
which works veritable wonders if employed as soon 
as it is made and never after it has been mixed 
more than a week or so. 

Bleach for the purpose four ounces of sweet 
almonds and pound them until they are quite 
smooth, add the yolks of three eggs and mix with 
fresh milk or cream; boil as you would a custard 
until it thickens; then add the perfume you prefer. 
Seal while hot. 

Complexion Cream — One of the best prepara- 
tions for the complexion is an equal quantity of 
tincture of benzoin and glycerine. It is applied 
as any cold cream. 

For Dry Skin — When the skin becomes dry and 
peels from the face, the skin lacks the natural oil. 
To make the face smooth again, a good greasy 
skin food should be used to supply the oil that 
is lacking in the skin. Each night massage a 
good skin food into the face for about ten minutes, 
then leave a portion of the cream on the face over 
night. Don't use powder or soap on the face for a 
few days. Instead of soap cleanse the face with 
oatmeal, which is at any time an excellent cleanser. 

To Whiten — For whitening the throat make a 
thick soap jelly by shaving a bar of white soap 
into a pint of boiling water. Allow it to dissolve 
and cool. Lather the throat with this, then rinse 
in hot water, and massage the throat with a cut 
lemon. Lemon is one of the best bleachers. 

A lotion recommended to whiten a red nose is 
made of seven and a half grains of tannic acid and 
two and a half ounces of camphor water. After 
the acid is dissolved the nose is moistened several 
times, day and night, the liquid drying on. 

Lavender Water is easily manufactured at home 
at small cost. Take half a pint of rectified spirits, 
two drams of essential oil of lavender, and live 
drops of attar of rose. Shake well together till 
properly mixed. Keep it in a well-corked bottle. 

An Astringent Wash will harden the flabby 
tissues and counteract the oily condition of the 
skin. Take a half pint bottle and into it put one 
and one-half ounces of cucumber juice, half filling 
the bottle with elder flower water and adding one 
ounce of eau de cologne. Shake well. Add one- 



half ounce of simple tincture of benzoin, shake 
slightly and fill with elder flower water. Night 
and morning apply this with a soft sponge. 

Freckles — An excellent lotion for light freckles 
is made of the following: Milk 4 ounces, lemon 
juice I ounce, spirits of ^vine 2 drams. 

Blackheads — To treat the skin for blackheads 
bathe the face in warm water, which is not too 
hot but pleasantly soothing to the skin. When the 
skin is pink and soft annoint it with green soap. 
Rub it thoroughly into the pores for three minutes 
and rinse the face with warm water, using a 
camels hair complexion brush. Then use cold 
water until the face has become thoroughly cold. 
Wipe thoroughly with sterilized gauze or cheese 
cloth. Fill the skin with cold cream dabbed on all 
over, let it remain for half an hour and then wipe 
off with a soft cloth. Continue the treatment 
nightly until blackheads have disappeared. 

An excellent eradicator for blackheads is made 
of one ounce tincture of green soap and thirty 
drops peroxide of hydrogen. Mix and apply with 
absorbant cotton, rubbing thoroughly. Let it re- 
main on half an hour and then wash off with cold 
water. Repeat four times a day. 

Starch Face Powder — Here is a simple "starch" 
treatment which will improve the best of skins 
and is especially good for brown ones. Milk-wet 
starch has a decidedly whitening effect on a brown 
skin, and when dry, makes a perfect face powder. 

Bathe the face for five or six minutes in ice cold 
milk, then before the liquid has time to dry, seize 
upon tiny cheese cloth bag half filled with pow- 
dered starch and holding it over your up-turned 
face, shake it gently, shifting its position every few 
seconds until the facial skin is lost to view be- 
neath a coat of white dust. The palm of the hand 
should now be passed over the face, with a gentle 
kneading motion, as this "evens" the powder and 
masks the skin imperfections. 

Eyebrows — To increase the growth of the eye- 
brows, rub pure olive oil in regularly each night. 

Wrinkles should be taken in hand early — before 
they become visible at all. Thirty is none too 
young to begin a treatment to ward off wrinkles: 
by forty the little lines may have established them- 
selves beyond repair. All facial blemishes show 
up much more plainly if the skin is not perfectly 
clean, healthy and fair; so a dingy, yellowish face 
should be assiduously guarded against. Soap 
should not be used on the complexion more than 
once a week, when a thorough scrubbing and 
steaming are given. Cold cream should be well 
rubbed in every night before retiring and the face

bathed afterwards in hot and then cold water. Thii 
cold cream treatment will not remove wrinkles, but 
it will keep the face in such condition that they 
will not form so readily and can be more easily 
eradicated. 

Wrinkles, unless too deeply seated, in a woman 
past middle age, will usually yield to persistent 
massage treatment in conjunction with a good skin 
food. 

If the face is bathed every morning in a cupful 
of fresh milk, in which a teaspoonful of table salt 
has been tossed, the muscles will tighten and sag- 
ging lines will disappear. 

Scars on Face — Many people are bothered with 
scars, left usually by hard ugly pimples. The face 
should be carefully steamed every night until the 
skin is quite clear. 

Make a cone of paper and fit one end of it to 
the face and the other to the outside of a pitcher 
or a tin pail or kettle. Pour a quart of boiling 
water into the pail and place the face in the cone. 
Let the face remain over the steam until the steam 
ceases to be given off, which will probably be about 
ten or twelve minutes. 

After the steaming pat the face dry, rubbing it 
gently, and apply some cold cream. The face 
should be massaged after the effects of the steam- 
ing have passed away, and while massaging gently 
pinch the spots where the scars or marks of the 
pimples remain. 

Pufly Eyes — Bathe the eyes each morning, using 
an eye cup, and massage gently underneath them. 
This will help to remedy the puffiness. 

You may have some internal trouble that causes 
the puffy condition under the eyes and makes your 
complexion sallow. Water is a good complexion 
clearer. Take olive oil each day or lemon juice 
unsweetened. The external trouble cannot be 
remedied permanently while internal causes exist. 

Care of the Lips — The best way to treat cracks 
in lips, that sometimes make their appearance in 
cold \veather, provided the cracks are not where 
they will break open whenever one laughs, is by 
astringents instead of greases. Many persons use 
cold cream or camphor ice at the first sign of such 
trouble, but they are not so quickly efficacious as 
spirits of camphor. It is drastic treatment to apply 
a stinging liquid to a raw spot but if one screws 
up courage enough to do it the result justifies the 
hurt. Creams and greases keep the sore places 
soft and while they undoubtedly allay the pain they 
do not aid in healing. Any lotion that keeps air 
from the raw spot relieves, but does not cure. An 



astringent, by drying the surface, helps form a scab, 
a natural protection, and healing goes on more 
rapidly. 

When afflicted with a deep crack like a cut 
in the middle of the lower lip. constant treatment 
with spirits of camphor is very beneficial. If out 
of doors all morning a tiny phial of the spirits 
should be carried so it can be used frequently. It 
feels like hot shot for a second but the sting soon 
passes away. The spirits should be put on night 
and morning also. Camphor ice >vill act in the 
same way, but much more slowly. It is often nec- 
essary if the wound is located where it must be 
induced to "heal soft" — that is, if hardening it 
cannot be done because it breaks open whenever 
one laughs, or for other cause. 

Tincture of benoin may be applied in precisely 
the same way as the camphor spirits. If it is 
strong enough to cause an uncomfortable sensation 
of "drawing" it may be diluted with a few drops 
of glycerine, using but little of the latter for it 
neutralizes the astringent. 

Another pleasant and healing application is made 
by a solution of one grain of permanganate of 
potash in a tablespoonful of clean rose-^vater. 
While this is wet on the surface, French chalk 
should be dusted on. 

Cleanse Crack — It is always well to wash any 
sore spot with a weak solution of boracic acid 
before applying the astringent. The object of the 
acid is thoroughly to cleanse the sore. 

Red Blood — There is little doubt but that con- 
tinued cracking of the lip indicates a thin condition 
of the blood and a physical state below par. Tonics 
containing phosphates are usually prescribed and 
iron niay be taken. This of course is a matter for 
physicians to decide and one should certainly be 
consulted when the lips cannot be healed. 

Little sore spots that sometimes stay so long 
in the corner of the mouth may come from the 
stomach; frequent applications of bicarbonate of 
soda will sometimes cure them. 

Superfluous Hairs — To treat, take enough pure 
peroxide of hydrogen to wet the hair and add a 
few drops of ammonia, which will bleach the hair 
and make it less conspicuous. 

Another Method, to bleach hair on arm: dampen 
baking soda with cold water and rub over the 
arms; leave it on several hours, then bathe the 
arm. Repeat daily until the hair is the shade you 
desire. 

Peroxide and ammonia will bleach superfluous 
hair and will not destroy the growth.

CARE OF THE SKIN 

(Iowa State College Bulletin) 

Care of the Skin — "The care of the skin takes on special significance when 
it is known that from one to two and a half pints of w^aste matter pass through the 
skin every twenty-four hours. An exposure to cold or lack of sufficient protection 
prevents this process, throws the strain upon the kidneys and is liable to derange 
the excretory organs. " 

The skin is a very important organ of excretion and must be kept in perfect 
working order. 

Baths — The cleansing bath ranges in temperature from 90 to 95° F. This is so near 
the normal temperature of the body that no shock is felt, especially if the bath is taken in 
a •warm room. The soap should not contain an excess of alkali. The strong soaps take 
oil from the skin and leave it dry and rough. All soap should be rinsed from the skin by 
the free use of clear water. The to-weling should be brisk and thorough. The thorough 
rubbing after the bath increases circulation, and by so doing helps to keep the skin well 
fed and firm. The cleansing bath is the best taken at night, since it is not only cleansing 
but relaxing. The fact that much impurity is deposited upon the skin through the perspi- 
ration glands makes the daily cleansing bath necessary for comfort, self-respect and good 
health. If the deposit is not removed the excretion is retarded, because the pores of the 
skin are closed by the deposit upon the surface of the skin. 

The tonic bath is best taken in the morning. It should be cold enough to cause the 
contraction of the blood vessels at the surface of the body. This contraction sends an addi- 
tional amount of blood to the heart. The additional blood stimulates increased heart action 
and sends the blood bounding back to the surface of the body again. This reaction leaves 
the skin w^arm and the circulation active. A cold bath should never be taken in a cold 
room. It should not be taken when one is greatly fatigued and it should not continue more 
than a minute. The cold bath should be followed by a brisk rubbing. While the cold 
bath is most beneficial for the normal person, it should not be persisted in unless it leaves 
the person warm and vigorous. 

The curative baths are Turkish, alcoholic, electric, salt, milk and hot water. The Tur- 
kish bath opens the pores of the skin and gives the skin a thorough cleansing. It then 
closes the pores by a cold bath, and relaxes the muscles by a thorough rubbing. 

A plain hot water bath opens the pores of the skin and draws the blood a^way from the 
inner parts of the body. It is too stimulating to the nervous system to be taken frequently. 
Its chief purpose is to relieve inflammation in the deeper parts of the body. 

Prevention of Colds — Careful care of the skin as has been indicated, helps to remove 
wastes and helps to maintain the normal condition, and for these reasons becomes a vital 
factor in the prevention of colds. The fact that a person is easily susceptible to colds in- 
dicates that the body is not in good Virorking order. Prevent colds by proper diet, good ven- 
tilation, moderate amount of heat in living room, an ample amount of outdoor exercise 
and a sufficient amount of sleep and rest. 

The Hands — It is not necessary for the hands to be rough and red, even though they 
perform much work. A good, mild soap (like plain castile) and some simple lotion (like 
glycerine and carbolic acid) will keep the hands soft and sufficiently moist, if used faith- 
fully. 



PER SONAL HYGIENE AND PERSON— CARE OF THE SKI N 425 

The Face — Do not let the face carry all the worries that have been experienced in a 
lifetime and do not allow it to become rough and dry. Keep the muscles relaxed by mas- 
sage. To keep the skin moist and pliable, use a mild soap, and very little of it. Follow 
the washing by a rinsing in cold water. 

Skin Blemishes — Do not depend upon outward applications to remove blemishes of the 
skin. They are the result of some failure to care for the body properly. Prevent them by 
proper diet, exercise, ample amount of fresh air, ample amount of sleep, proper clothing. 
The care of the body determines its condition. Care for the body and there will be no blem- 
ishes of the skin. Be careful to use your own soap and your own towel. Diseases of the 
skin are often contracted by using the public towel and the public soap.

THE HAIR AND SCALP 

A few general rules for the care of the hair: 

Avoid strong soap and alkalis, such as soda and ammonia, hair tonics of 
which you are not sure, and too much hot water. Tliese all dry up natural oil and 
make the hair harsh and given to falling. 

Depend on regular brushing of hair rather than on tonics. Ten minutes of 
stiff brushing twice a day will do wonders for preventing the hair thinning. 

The hair is improved by heating the brush before using. Frequently hold the brush 
to the fire, then brush the scalp. Hair, highly charged with electricity, is snappy and will 
fly about in the most unruly manner, but it can be evenly brushed with the heated brush. 

Keep the hair absolutely clean. This may be assisted by a dry shampoo if a wet one 
cannot be given frequently. For a dry shampoo, powder the hair and scalp well and brush 
until every particle of powder is gone. 

Hair should always be thoroughly dried, as the mingling of water with natural oil 
causes fermentation, vrhich means dandruff and falling locks. Give the hair plenty of light 
and air, but do not expose it to the hot rays of the sun for long at a time, it bleaches the 
hair and often blisters the scalp, drying up the natural oil. 

So long as the scalp moves freely over the skull there is hope for the bald head. 

Be particular not to use the brushes and combs of another, and do not use your own 
in an unsanitary condition. One cause of the baldness of men is their carelessness in this 
respect. 

Do not bum your hair, twist it into tortuous knots, strain it back from the temples or 
wear it always in the same coil. 

After washing the head thoroughly withsoft water and soap put a teaspoonful or more 
of lemon juice in the last rinsing water. This will make the hair soft and fluffy. 

CARE OF THE HAIR 

(Iowa State College Bulletin) 

The Hair — ^The hair is provided with oil by the sebaceous glands that lie at its 
roots. Regular and vigorous brushing of the hair increases the flow of oil and keeps 
the hair glossy. The hair is fed by the blood vessels that enter the inner layer of 
the skin, in which the hair root is imbedded. A good nervous system, which pro- 
motes good circulation, is one of the essentials in producing a healthy growth of 
hair. 

It is as necessary for the scalp to be kept clean as for the surface of any other portion 
of the skin to be kept clean. The hair should be thoroughly brushed to remove dust. It 
should be left loose and free at night to allow the moisture to evaporate and to permit air to 
pass through it freely. The scalp should be thoroughly rubbed at least once a week. This 
promotes a good circulation and thus gives the hair a vigorous growth.

HAIR AND SCALP MISCELLANIES 

Washing the Hair — The hair should be washed at least once a month. Soft water, 
mild soap and thorough rinsing in clear water are essential to a successful washing. 

Dry Cleaning — Part the hair and rub coarse corn meal on the scalp. Use at least 
two cups of corn meal. After the meal has been thoroughly rubbed over the entire sur- 
face of the scalp, brush thoroughly until all traces of the meal have been removed. Drv 
cleaning removes dust and stimulates the hair, because of the thorough rubbing. It also re- 
moves the superfluous oil. Too frequent washing removes too much oil and leaves the hair 
too dry and brittle. For this reason it is well to use the dry cleaning occasionally. 



Hair Too Oily — It is an interesting fact that the 
majority of scalp troubles begin with an appear- 
ance of oiliness. This condition often develops 
when a girl is "run down." Build up by sleep, 
fresh air and nutritious diet. 

An excellent preparation for application to an 
oily scalp is composed of the following: Precip- 
itated sulphur, I drachm; salicylic acid, 15 grains; 
glycerine of starch, 1 drachm; alcohol, 6 drachms; 
water up to 4 ounces. This may be scented if 
desired. 

To Brighten the Hair — To brigthen dead looking 
hair use diluted peroxide of hydrogen, which is 
applied in the following manner; first wash the 
hair thoroughly, using ammonia to cut all grease. 
Dry the hair, preferably in the sun. Half fill a 
saucer with hydrogen peroxide, add one-half as 
much water, dip into it a clean hair brush and 
apply the mixture thoroughly to the hair. This 
will not be sufficient to make any noticeable change 
in the color. 

Brush the hair with the damp brush and stand 
in the sunshine, if possible, until the hair is thor- 
oughly dry. Do not repeat the process for two 
months at the earliest unless you v^ant to make 
the hair much lighter. This in no way injures 
ashly looking hair, but it really improves its ap- 
pearance. However, it must never be lavishly 
used. 

To Make Glossy — A very good preparation to 
make the hair glossy is composed of two drachms 
of castor oil and six ounces of cologne water. A 
few drops of this dressing or brillantine are poured 
into the palm of the hand. A soft, spotlessly 
clean hair brush is gently rotated on the palm so 
that the dressing may be evenly distributed on the 
bristles. Now apply it to the hair, which should 
have received a previous brushing with stiffer 
bristles. The brillantine is gently spread over the 
hair and a soft silk handkerchief is used to give 
the final polish. 

Medicine Dropper for Hair — When using hair 
tonic or hair-dressing the most economical and sat- 
isfactory way is to use a bent glass medicine 
dropper. This permits the exact quantity wanted 



to be deposited where needed at the roots of the 
hair. 

A Honte-Made Hair Tonic that is really wonder- 
ful in its results, is absolutely harmless, and actually 
retards falling hair and tones the scalp in every 
way, is made as follows: 

Take 2 teaspoonfuls of sulphur and mix with 
about five cents worth of glycerine. Pour over a 
package of sage about a quart of boiling water; 
let steep on back of stove about two hours; when 
cool strain into bottle and add sulphur and glycer- 
ine. Then add small quantity of alcohol, just 
enough to keep the tonic from souring — about 
2 tablespoonfuls. The sulphur may not all be dis- 
solved; that does not matter — simply shake well 
each time before using. It is the sulphur in the 
tonic that stops and cuts dandruff, and dandruff 
causes the hair to fall out. Rub the scalp with the 
finger ends until it feels hot, then rub the tonic 
into the scalp. 

Restores Graying Hairs — Moisten a sponge or 
soft brush with the above tonic and draw this 
through the hair, taking one strand'at a time. The 
graying hairs in the head will begin to disappear 
after two or three applications, the natural color 
is restored and it becomes thick, glossy and 
lustrous. 

Ten minutes spent every evening will give you 
almost a new head of hair in two months, put new 
life into the hair roots, restore the gray hairs and 
stop additional hairs graying. The hair will gro\v 
several inches under the treatment. The scalp 
must be regularly massaged vrith the fingers each 
time before and after the application is made. 

Gray Hair — Stop the Causes — They are many: 
poor health, shock, extracting too much of the 
natural oil of the scalp by too frequent shampoo- 
ing, etc. If the hair is dry, rub yellow vaseline on 
the scalp every other day, then brush it thoroughly. 

It is difficult to entirely restore color to hair that 
has turned gray. The application of oil will some- 
times do it, and very occasionally an extremely 
stimulating tonic is beneficial. Try one made of 
one ounce of castor oil, an ounce of strong am- 
monia in liquid, two ounces of French brandy, and 



PERSONAL HYGIENE AND PERSON— HAIR AND SCALP 



429 



six ounces of rose water. This may be massaged 
into the scalp every other day, not oftener. 

For Dandruff Only — Warm borax water will re- 
move dandruff; it has no general tonic effect, ho>v- 
ever, (or hair and scalp otherwise. 

Though dandruff is not originally a disease, it 
may easily become the predisposing cause for 
many disorders of the scalp, just as neglect to 
keep the body clean brings on its train of con- 
sequential evils. 

The permanent benefit — It is necessary when 
troubled with dandruff to massage the scalp thor- 
oughly, after which you will find the following 
treatment very beneficial: moisten the scales of 
dandruff with olive oil; when crusts are soft, wash 
scalp with tincture of green soap. Rinse thor- 
oughly and apply almond oil to the scalp. Rub in 
with your finger tips, then use the following 
shampoo: Ammonia muriate, ten grains; glycerine, 
one ounce: rose water, five ounces. Rub this 
briskly into the scalp. At the end of ten days use 
the following shampoo: 

Soap Jelly Shampoo Shave a small cake of best 

white castil^ soap into a pint of boiling water and 
let stand until thick, then add a teaspoonful of 
glycerine and a few drops of your favorite per- 
fume. The glycerine is softening and healing to 
the scalp. 

The hair must be wet enough so that the "jelly" 
will adhere: then by rubbing until a thick lather 
forms the whole head and scalp will be thoroughly 
cleansed before using the abundance of warm 
water always necessary for rinsing. After a care- 
ful rinsing continue with waters gradually cooled 
until quite cold. 

For Dry Hair — If the hair is dry and brittle 
and you have abused it in any manner, such as 
getting it wet with salt water and then drying in 
the sun, you must take immediate steps to keep it 
from falling out. The hair should be shampooed 
with an egg mixture. No ammonia, borax, or any 
sort of alkali must be used on hair that has been 
thus abused. 

Split-end Hair — If your hair shows split-ends and 
a tendency to fall out, have the split ends clipped 
off, and if the hair is long enough to permit it, have 
at least two inches of it cut off. Then every night 
brush the hair thoroughly with a stiff (not a wire) 



brush and after the brushing have a tonic massaged 
into the scalp. 

Egg Shampoo — Yolk of one egg, one pint of 
rainwater (lukewarm), an ounce of rosemary 
spirits. Beat the mixture up thoroughly and use 
it warm, rubbing well into the skin of the head. 
Rinse in several waters. The scalp should be mas- 
saged every night, moistening the finger tips with 
olive oil, and the following lotion may be applied: 

Lotion — Glycerine, I ounce; eau de cologne, 
1/2 pint, liquid ammonia, 1 drachm; oil of geranium, 
oil of rosemary, ^/i drachm of each; tincture of 
cantharides, I ounce. Briskly agitate for ten min- 
utes and then add camphor julep J/2 pint and 
again mix well and stir. A few drops of essence 
of musk or other perfume can be added. 

Shampoo for Golden Hair — Golden hair requires 
the most careful brushing and cleaning. An in- 
fusion of camomile flowers is a good shampoo for 
light hair. An effective dry shampoo for such hair 
is made of alcoholic ammonia, half an ounce; the 
same tincture of quinine, two drachms of essence of 
Vh^ood violet, and alcohol sufficient to make eight 
ounces. The shampoo should be applied by rub- 
bing it well into the scalp and drying the head with 
a rough towel No water is required. 

Massage your Scalp but do not rub the hair. 

Separate the hair and rub vaseline on the scalp 
Gently, then place the tips of the fingers firmly on 
the scalp and work all over the scalp with a rotary 
motion and move the scalp with each rotation of 
the fingers; loosening the scalp with each rotation 
does much good. 

Eyebrows and Lashes — Use as a tonic for the 
eyebrovi^s one ounce of yellow vaseline and eight 
drops each of oil of lavender and rosemary. Place 
a drop of the tonic on an eyebrow brush and 
smooth eyebrovsr carefully after the face has been 
washed. 

Do not use this preparation on the lashes. Ap- 
ply only yellow vaseline to them, using a small 
camels hair brush and rubbing gently along the 
roots. 

Do not Cut Eyelashes — Try melting yellow vas- 
eline and putting it on the roots of the lashes with 
a tiny camels hair brush, being careful not to 
get any of the oil in the eyes. This is excellent 
to promote growth of scanty lashes.

CARE OF THE TEETH 

A famous old Frenchman was once heard to say that a woman with really 
good teeth could never be plain. Although this may be rather a sweeping state- 
ment there is no doubt that an otherwise plain appearance is often redeemed by 
a perfect set of teeth and the effect of many a pretty face marred by bad teeth. 

CARE OF TEETH 

(Iowa State College Bulletin) 

The tooth consists of root and crown. There is a small opening at the end 
of each root through which the nerves and blood vessels pass. This opening leads 
to the pulp cavity which extends through the entire inner part of the crown and 
root. The greater part of the crown consists of dentine, which is covered by a layer 
of hard enamel as a protective layer. The dentine of the root is covered with a 
layer of cement. 

Effect of Acid on Teeth 

The chief element in the composition of the teeth is lime, and lime is easily decom- 
posed by acid. 

Experiment — Drop a few drops of hydrochloric acid upon a piece of lime and notice 
what happens. The gas bubbles that are seen show that the lime is being decomposed by 
the acid. 

This experiment shows the effect of acids upon the lime in the teeth. 

Source of Acid — The bacteria cause the fermentation of the lodged particles of food. 
The acid formed eats into the lime in the tooth and may continue to eat until the nerve 
is exposed, if the tooth is not cared for. 

Effects of Tartar — Tartar is composed of lime which is deposited from the saliva. Tar- 
tar forms on the inner side of the lower front teeth and at the base of the crown of the 
teeth. It forms a hard crust which prevents the removal of acid and bacteria by means 
of the brush. The tartar should be thoroughly removed by a dentist at least once a year. 

RemovsJ of Acid — Brushing with a solution of baking soda neutralizes the acid. Brush- 
ing with clear water, after this, removes all acid from the mouth. 

Removal of Food Particles — A thorough brushing after each meal, before breakfast 
and after supper is the ideal method of caring for the teeth. A thorough brushing means 
a brushing of at least five minutes. The brush should come in contact with all parts of the 
teeth, upper and lower, front and back, inner and outer surface. A good powder should 
be used several times a week, but all traces of powder should be removed by brushing with 
clear water. If the brushing is followed by a thorough mouth rinse of listerine solution it is 
much better. 

Csure of Child's Teeth — Each child should have his tooth brush and be taught to use 
it as soon as he is two or three years old. It is very desirable that he acquire the habit 
of caring for his teeth. In this way tooth brushing becomes as much a part of the day's 
routine as eating and sleeping. 

Dentist's Care — The dentist, like the doctor, should be given a chance to prevent trou- 
ble rather than to correct it. Let the dentist do his work at the first warning. Remember 
that mastication is an important step in digestion. Save the teeth. 

431 



432 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK — Section Vlll — Personal Hygiene and Person 

A Few Don'ts — Do not bite thread with the teeth. It may break the enamel after a 
time. Do not crack nuts with the teeth. Nature did not plan them to be used as cast iron 
hammers. They are not strong enough for that. Avoid drinking extremely hot drinks 
or extremely cold drinks. Either practice may weaken the enamel of the teeth. Do not 
forget that a gum-boil may mean an abcessed tooth and that the dentist should be con- 
sulted. 

Tooth Building Food — Since the chief element in the composition of the teeth is lime, 
such foods must be included in the diet, as contain lime. Some of these foods are spinach, 
lettuce, celery, tomatoes, cabbage, parsnips, mushrooms, turnips, com, beets, asparagus, 
cauliflower, carrots, string beans, potatoes, radishes and onions. These are the chief lime- 
producing foods and help to build up the teeth. 

The teeth are so absolutely necessary to good digestion that too much care cannot 
be taken to preserve them. If the child's teeth decay prematurely it is not an accident and 
may not be altogether the result of a failure to keep them clean. It is very frequently the 
result of a poorly nourishd body and it is quite as necessary to study the feeding and gen- 
eral care of the body as to study the care of the teeth. 

MISCELLANIES ON TEETH 

Night Cleansing — Perfectly formed, even white teeth are a natural gift, but much can 
be done to improve the color and keep them in good condition, chief among these little 
attentions being careful brushing night and morning. Now, while everyone cleans his or 
her teeth in the morning, very many, unfortunately for their teeth, neglect to do so at 
night, and this is a very grave mistake. During the night particles of food which have 
lodged between the teeth do incalculable damage. If but two or three minutes is given to 
brushing them at night much decay is arrested. 

Tartar — The presence of tartar upon the teeth is a source of worry to many, as it is 
not only unsightly but causes the teeth to ache and makes tender gums. Tartar can be 
removed quite easily. Procure a small quantity of magnesia, wet the tooth brush in warm 
water, dip into the magnesia, and rub the teeth upon which the tartar has collected. If one 
application does not entirely remove it, give a second treatment the next day. 

The Best Mouth Wash — Used by the Medical Corps in the Army: Five drops of lysol 

in a glass of warm water. Lysol is a soapy carbolic preparation. The lysol wash is a most 
efficient disinfectant for germs located in the mouth as well as a deodorizer; the alkali in 
the soap neutralizes the mouth acids. 

The brush for cleaning the teeth should be fairly stiff, but not hard enough to injure the 
gums. 

Children's Teeth — At the first sign of decay a dentist should be consulted and a cav- 
ity filled. Neglect to do this results in the loss of the teeth eventually, and although the 
modern art of dentistry is now so perfect that false teeth or crowns can be procured to look 
exactly like one's own they can never be quite the same, and children especially are enti- 
tled to early care and sound, natural teeth. 

Once mature years have been reached nothing can be done for the shape of the teeth 
or toward regulating their position, but those who have care of children should see that 
these matters are promptly attended to by the dentist, for much of the pain and discom- 
fort which so many people experience with their teeth through life can be prevented by a 
little attention in childhood. 

Four Essentials — For the care and preservation of the teeth : Proper diet, proper tooth 
brush, proper tooth powders or pastes and proper mouth bath. 



PERSONAL HYGIENE AND PERSON— CARE OF THE TEETH 433 

Dental Floss — The passing of dental floss back and forth between the teeth at least 
once a day is desirable. Care should be observed, however, not to injure the gums by mak- 
ing them bleed. 

Use Magnesia — A mouthful of mag^nesia taken into the mouth every night, allowing it 
to penetrate every nook and cranny, will correct tendency to acidity and prevent the decay 
which comes from chemical decomposition of particles of food. A good milk of magnesia 
is even better for this purpose. 

Sore Gums — If the gums are sore and festered, if caries have formed around or be- 
tween the teeth, do not iail to consult a reliable dentist without delay. Such a condition 
of the mouth and gums may poison the blood and seriously impair the general health. 

Digestion — A healthy digestion is important in keeping the mouth sweet and clean; 
saliva free from elements that tend to cause decay of the teeth is essential to a wholesome 
condition of the alimentary canal.

CARE OF THE EYES, EARS AND NOSE 

(Iowa State College Bulletin) 

The Eyes — Keep the body in good health. The general health has a direct in- 
fluence upon the vigor and the activity of the eye. 

Do not hold the eye to close work for too great a length of time. This is too taxing 
for the muscles of accommodation. If it is necessary to do the close work, rest the eye fre- 
quently by looking at some distant objects. This gives an opportunity for the muscles of 
accommodation to relax. 

Do not hold the printed page too far from or too close to the eye. Eighteen inches 
is about the proper distance. Fine print is too taxing to the eye. A glossy paper is more 
taxing upon the eye than paper with a dull finish. 

Soft, restful colors are less taxing to the eyes than the bright, glaring colors. Soft 
tan, dull green and soft gray are restful colors and are good colors to choose for wall 
coverings, especially for school room walls. A highly finished white wall is irritating to the 
eye. Red is an irritating color and should not be used for wall colorings. 

Reading while a train is in motion is taxing to the eyes, because the muscles of ac- 
commodation are required to work too hard, n adjusting the lenses of the eye to suit the 
motion of the printed page before the eye. 

A poor light is not true economy. The poor light is a direct means of injuring the 
sight, and expert care of the sight is more expensive than adequate lighting facilities, it 
is possible to have good lights in the farm home, now^ that gasoline lamps, denatured al- 
cohol lamps and the home gas plant have been perfected to such a degree. The light from 
sun or artificial source should not shine directly into the eyes. School room seats should 
be so arranged as to prevent this. The bed of the invalid should be arranged with this 
thought in view. Infants who are out for an airing should have eyes protected from the 
sunlight. 

Veils with large spots are injurious to the eyes and should not be worn. Bright red 
veils should not be worn. 

Expert care of the eye is needed when it becomes necessary to hold the printed page 
other than at normal distance from the eye, when severe headaches seem to indicate that the 
eyes are not normal and when the school child is unable to read blackboard work readily. 

Imperfect organs of sight not only prevent the full enjoyment of surroundings, but im- 
pair the general health. 

Care of Elars — A study of the structure of the ear will suggest the danger of using sharp 
instruments of any kind in removing substances from the ear. The tympanum or sounding 
board of the ear is a delicate and tightly stretched membrane which is easily punctured. 
A study of the location of the eustachian tube will show the close relation between the ear 
and throat, and demonstrate the fact that the hearing may be impaired by a diseased throat. 
Avoid colds by taking care of the body. Keep the throat in good condition and you will 
also help to keep the ears in normal condition. 

Avoid taking young children where the ears will be shocked by loud and discordant 
noises. Loud noises are stimulating and irritating. 

Care of the Nose — The nostrils have been provided with a sieve of fine hairs called 
cilia. The function of the cilia is to exclude dust in order that the throat and lungs may 
be protected from irritation. The cilia do their work as best they can, considering our care- 
lessness. We sweep carelessly and raise a large amount of dust. We fail to ventilate prop- 

435 



436 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Section VIII— Personal Hygiene and Person 



eriy and so irritate the lining of the nostrils. We fail to care for the body properly and so 
continue to take cold easily. Repeated colds leave the cavities of the nose filled with 
wastes and leave the membrane weakened. 

Suggestions — Use dustless sweeping powder. Use a vacuum cleaner. Use a paraffin 
mop, use a cotton flannel broom bag and dip the bag in melted paraffin. In these and other 
ways remove the dust from the house. Keep the body in good condition and aid in pre- 
vention of colds. Breathe through the nostrils and thus prevent the entrance of dust.

CARE OF THE HANDS AND NAILS 

The most amazing amount of damage is done to the hands and nails where 
women grow negligent in their care and because they do long continued work fall 
into the lazy habit, after a time, of letting the hands go "till they get through." 
Girls in offices, or at a sales counter, frequently injure their hands astonishingly 
by not washing them often enough. And the woman in the home contracts the 
same habit far more often than she thinks she is ever going to allow herself. 

When cleaning hands that are really stained with dirt which has remained in 
the pores for several hours, soap and water should not be the first application, for 
nothing but a soft grease will be effective. Vaseline is one of the best dust remov- 
ers, for it penetrates all cracks, softening instead of hardening the matter. A fluid 
soap used directly afterwards extracts the grease, bringing the foreign matter with 
it. In cases of extreme soil mere washing leaves the skin in a dingy condition. 
This is the explanation of many unsightly hands and a defect that is easily reme- 
died. There are other oily applications as beneficial as vaseline for this purpose, 
among them being sweet almond oil, or soft cold cream. A necessary feature of 
these is that the application must be either liquid or one that liquifies quickly, or 
it will only be a dust collector. 

Wash Hands in Grease — It takes less than five minutes to get into condition if a pot 
of grease is kept near the washstand and is used in liberal quantities, as for instance a lump 
the size of an English walnut at each cleansing. This takes about half a minute. Then the 
hands must be dipped into warm (not hot) water. Any simple soap may be used, but strong 
kinds should be avoided. A nail brush is necessary, but one of an inexpensive quality will 
be as cleansing as a costly one. The finger tips require several extra strokes. Rinsing must 
be thorough. 

How to Dry the Hands — Drying is not the simple process that many persons think and 
in the manner of doing it lies half the secret of having pretty nails. 

Each finger must be taken separately, the towel rubbed down the sides, back and 
front, beginning at the tip. The common mistake is to begin at the finger base and rub up, 
which simply trains the cuticle down over the nails and thickens the tips. 

Every nail must be wiped individually commencing at the top and pressing gently 
down to the crescent of the base of the nail. Only in this way will good shape be pre- 
served. The fact that knuckles are not thoroughly dried is many times an explanation of 
redness. 

For Rough Hands — Use a mixture of glycerine For whitening the hands an excellent formula 

and bay rum, equal parts; rub over the hands each to be used after washing is made of 15 grains of 

time after having them in water any length of powdered borax, 1 3 grains of common table salt,

If the perspiration on the hands is excessive 
bathe thoroughly with this astringent lotion several 
times daily: Rose water, six ounces; elder flower 
water, two ounces; simple tincture of benzoin, one- 
half ounce: tannic acid, 10 grains. 

If the hands and arms turn unusually red try 
this liquid-white, which will hide, but will not re- 
duce redness: Pure oxide of zinc, one ounce; 
glycerine, one dram; rose %vater, four ounces; es- 
sence of rose, 1 5 drops. Shake well and apply 
with a soft sponge or an antiseptic gauze. The 
skin must be well wiped ofl before the liquid dries. 

Home Manicuring — In these days, when beauty 
culture is a fine art, every woman who has con- 
sideration for her appearance sees that her nails 
are well kept and daintily manicured. 

This does not involve the expenditure of either 
a great deal of time or trouble; neither is it nec- 
essary to engage the services of a professional n^an- 
icurist. A few simple instruments, and five minutes 
devoted to their care two or three times a week 
will serve to keep the nails in perfect order. 

All that is required is a pair of sharp scissors, 
a file, a few emery boards, an orange stick, a 
cuticle knife and a chamois leather-covered nail 
polisher. 

The Process — Before attempting to manicure 
the nails, soak the hands in a basin of warm soapy 
water, so that the cuticle may become perfectly 
soft and easy to manipulate. 

Filing — When this has been done, file the nails 
carefully. They should be cut so that the extreme 
edges of the nail and the tip of the linger are 
even, and each nail should be cut to follow the 
curve of the finger to which it belongs. Pointed 
nails are not only unfashionable but positively 
ugly. After filing, rub each nail with an emery 
to ensure its being perfectly smooth at the tip. 

The Half-Moon — Now loosen the cuticle or skin 
round the base of the nail' with the cuticle knife. 
This should be done carefully. If the skin gets 
cut in the process a raw bleeding appearance will 
be the result. The skin should first be lifted away 
from the nail, and then when perfectly loose 
pressed back to reveal the little half-moon at the 
base. 



In some hands these half-moons are visible on 
all the fingers, even when the hands have been 
neglected, on others they are only visible after 
long treatment, but in the majority of hands they 
will be quite plainly seen after two or three man- 
icures. They are, however, such a decided adjunct 
to the beauty of the hand that it is quite worth 
while to take a little trouble to cultivate them. 

Hang Nails — Often after loosening the cuticle 
small portions of the skin will adhere to the nails. 
These can be removed at once by dipping an 
orange stick into soapy water or a little vaseline 
and rubbing the nail with it. Any "hang nails" 
must be clipped off as closely as possible, but it 
is a good plan to avoid cutting the cuticle \vhenever 
possible, as doing so only helps to render it hard, 
thick and coarse. 

Finishing — A piece of cut lemon rubbed over 
the nails will remove any stains, and a little white 
vaseline should then be smeared on, wiped off with 
a soft rag, a little pink polishing powder dusted 
on, and the chamois-leather nail polisher applied. 
When all is finished, dip the finger tips again into 
the soapy water to cleanse them from the vaseline 
and powder, and dry the hands on a soft towel. 
It is a good plan to press the cuticle around each 
nail carefully back each time the hands are washed 
and dried, as this will serve to keep the little half- 
moon visible. 

Blunt Instruments — When purchasing a cuticle 
knife care should be taken to see that it is not too 
sharp. Except the scissors, all the instruments 
used for manicuring should be rather blunt, as 
when sharp they are apt to injure the surface of 
the nail, leaving it rough, and also to cut and 
bruise the cuticle. 

Bleach the Nails — Finger nails that retain their 
grayish tinge at the tips should be bleached. This 
can be done with borax dampened with ammonia, 
or ammonia and peroxide of hydrogen. Moisten 
the nails on the underside, slip some cotton or a 
cambric handkerchief over the orange stick, and 
wipe the nail edges. In most cases the nails are 
instantly turned a shell white. 

For Brittle Nails — If nails break easily rub with 
cold cream or white vaseline or cocoa butter and 
their brittleness will be lessened.

CARE OF THE FEET 

Pink toes, arched feet, thin and slender ones, are as much an attraction 
as a straight nose, well curved lips and telling eyes. It is not perhaps given many 
of your friends to see your feet frequently unshod, but your own sense of comfort 
and well-being as well as your self-consciousness of cleanliness and neatness are 
involved in the question of your feet. 

We often ignore the item of sensible care of the feet — not merely the trimming of toe 
nails and the treatment of soft and hard corns or callous places but the reasonable way 
of treating this important part of our physical makeup so as to avoid unnecessary suffering. 
For instance, there is the shoe question, which is in summer time so annoying and weighty. 
A foot specialist declares that canvas shoes, or soft thin tan ones, are or ought to be 
the only eligible kind for summer wear. To bring back our feet, our poor misused, ill- 
treated feet, to their normal and natural state, means much to health and temper. 

Should we happen to be enjoying ourselves for a brief space in the country the chance 
to wear sandals, or in some other way "almost nothing," should not be missed; it is bene- 
fiting and refreshing to the utmost. Are we less fortunate, let us adapt ourselves and go 
stocking footed around the house for a while each day. 

When you bathe your feet, add a little alum, to water hot and cold alternately; it will 
help a great deal in keeping them in good condition and you will find your general com- 
fort greatly increased. Some prefer sharp salt water, some bismuth, but an addition of the 
one or the other is very much to be recommended. 

A little cold cream or olive oil rubbed in and then carefully wiped off, then powder- 
ing, is delicious for tired feet. 

It is not a bit hard to avoid sore feet, even for the most trying occupations; it is all 
in the knowing how — and w^hat is most important is following the dictates of one's own 
good common sense and experience. 

FEET AND THEIR CLOTHING 

(Iowa State College Bulletin) 

Physical efficiency depends upon the normal condition of all of the organs 
of the body and two of the members that have much to do with the physical effi- 
ciency are the feet. Many feet are ruined by being carelessly shod in the early life 
of the child. The mother who is careless in this respect has much to be responsi- 
ble for. 

Precautions — Be sure that the heel of the shoe is low enough to throw the weight of 
the body upon the ball of the foot. This height varies with different people. Be sure that 
the shoe fits snugly around the heel and instep. The shoe that is loose at the heel slips and 
fails to protect the heel or instep. The instep especially needs protection because of the 
weight it has to carry and because of the number of small bones which are bound together 
by ligaments. 

Be sure that the widest part of the foot (across the foot at the great toe joint) ex- 
actly coincides with the widest part of the shoe. Be sure that the shoe is amply wide at 
the toes. There should be room for the toes to move freely. The freedom of motion in- 
sures good circulation and good circulation insures proper nourishment of the feet. The toe 
of the shoe should be so shaped as to allow the great toe to lie in a vertical position rather 
than to be crowded into an oblique position. 

441 



442 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK — Section VIll— Personal Hygiene and Person 

The shoe should be made of firm, but porous leather. A dense leather does not al- 
low the moisture to evaporate and so makes the feet tender. The fact that the leather is 
stiff retards the free action of the joints and muscles and so weakens the feet. 

The sole of the street shoe should be thick enough to protect the sole of the foot from 
dampness. The low shoe should not be worn except in warm weather. Severe colds, 
weak throats and weak lungs are directly traceable to low shoes and to thin soles. 

Care of Feet — The feet are covered so closely so many hours of the day, that care- 
ful bathing, rubbing and dressing are absolutely necessary. Careful bathing in water at 
body temperature relieves inflammation. A thorough rubbing in cocoa butter promotes 
good circulation, tends to relax the muscles, and makes the skin firm and well nourished. 
Corns will probably disappear when pressure or friction is removed. If it seems necessary 
to trim them, sterilize the knife, and do not trim too deeply, as a serious infection may re- 
sult. 



MISCELLANIES ON FEET 



Tender feet generally arise from the neglect of 
cleanliness, the use of thin cotton or silk stockings 
and boots or shoes that are either too stiff and 
tight or misshapen or not sufficiently porous to 
admit of the escape of perspiration. 

Tight boots and shoes, and water-proof ones, 
which are also air-tight, are the most common 
causes of tender feet: they also are the cause of 
headaches, dizziness, dyspepsia, diarrhoea and even 
apoplexy. Boots and shoes too narrow across the 
toes or the tread of the foot, or insufficiently long 
for ease and comfort, though large enough else- 
where, either cramp or distort the fore part of the 
foot and toes, or arrest the nails in their forward 
growth, forcing them back upon the sensitive flesh 
at their roots and sides and causing them to grow 
in thickness and width only — results which may be 
gradual but are always painful — usually the effect 
known as "ingrowing nails." 

Corns are pests that make a vixenish temper ex- 
cusable. Yet they are curable. The surest pre- 
ventive is a perfect-fitting shoe and absolute clean- 
liness. When they first arrive they may be kept 
quiet by tying the feet up at night with a piece 
of lemon over the offending member. Soak the 
next day in hot water. This, if repeated for sev- 
eral nights, will so soften the corn that it can be 
easily pinched out. Never cut a corn; blood poison 
is worse, on the whole, than a bad disposition and 
a scolded family. 

Tired Feet — Bathing the feet with alcohol when 
tired, or rubbing them with a little cocoa butter 
after a mustard bath, is restful. A wash of bran 
and soda will ease the "burn" of tired sore feet. 

Bath for the Feel — You may secure much com- 
fort for the feet by giving them a bath lasting 



at least 20 "minutes in water which is kept con- 
stantly as hot as can be endured and to which has 
been added household ammonia in the proportion 
of a tablespoonful to every quart of water. After 
bath for ten minutes the feet should be rubbed 
under the water as vigorously and continuously as 
their tenderness will allow and wiped dry with a 
soft towel. 

To Keep Feet From Swelling — Dip the feet every 
night in hot water and rub them with vaseline. 
Don*t wear the same pair of shoes two days in 
succession. 

The Toe Nails require attention the same as the 
finger nails, only they should never be cut down 
at the corners but nearly straight across; they 
should not extend beyond the flesh. The cuticle 
should be loosened after the bath, when it will peel 
off easily. 

Inflamed Joint — If the joint of the big toe be- 
comes inflamed, wear a shoe that is wide enough to 
keep the toes from being pinched together. Put 
a piece of absorbent cotton between the great and 
second toes, large enough to keep them apart; 
then take an adhesive plaster and bandage the 
ball of the foot (irmly, holding the joint in place. 
By holding the joint in place with the plaster the 
inflammation will soon leave and it will become 
normal. 

Chilblains — A chilblain lotion that is found 
soothing is made from half an ounce of gylcerine 
and twenty grains each of tinctures of iodine and 
opium. It is kept over the places on bandages, 
the cloths never becoming dry. If the irritation is 
on the feet, woolen stockings should be worn, and 
the greatest care given not to getting the toes 
damp.

PERSONAL CLOTHING 

(Iowa State College Bulletin) 

ElfFect Upon Health — The entire body should be uniformly clothed. Materials 
differ in their ability to conduct heat. Poor conductors like fur and wool are most 
suitable for winter. Too much clothing causes waste of energy. Good conductors 
like linen, silk and cotton are best for summer. Black and dark shades of any 
color are warmer, because they have the power of holding the rays of sunlight. 
White has the power of refracting the rays of sunlight, hence keeps the body 
cooler. The garment that does not fit the body comfortably impairs the circu- 
lation and affects the general health. 

Effect Upon Chsu'acter — Perfectly fitted, well-made clothing that is suitable in 
style, makes the wearer unconscious of her clothes. It makes her genuine and 
wholesome rather than careless, superficial and extravagant. 

Color and design are very important factors in dress. Poor material in gaudy 
colors is conspicuous. It indicates cheapness in the garment and lack of taste in 
the wearer. It should be avoided. Dull, ugly colors are depressing. Fabrics in 
soft, rich colors, harmoniously blended, are pleasing and modest. They are artistic 
and have a refining influence upon the appearance and character of the person wear- 
ing them. 

Care of Clothing — Clothing must be well aired, since damp garments remove too great 
an amount of heat from the body. The frequent airing and sunning helps to destroy dis- 
ease germs and to remove waste matter that has been thrown off by the skin. These wastes 
are scales from the skin, oily matter from the glands, and substances left on the surface 
by perspiration. All dust should be removed from the clothing, since dust may be an 
active carrier of disease germs. Clothing must be kept in proper place to prevent waste 
of time and loss of temper. Clothing must be kept in good repair for the same reasons. 

Purchase of Clothing — Before making a purchase, every woman should decide what 
style of garment is required, what materials will harmonize best with her present wardrobe, 
what amount of money may be spent and what quality of material should be secured from 
that expenditure. She should also know the amount of material required for each gar- 
ment. 

Suggestions — It pays to buy one good garment rather than two cheap ones. All wool 
fabrics wear well and do not fade or soil easily. The demand for woolen cloth exceeds 
the supply, hence many devices are used to make the supply go a long way and to deceive 
the buyer. 

Standard cotton materials wear well, are cheap, and plentiful. Cheap cotton mate- 
rials are often filled with starch and when washed are coarse and loosely w^oven. 

Do not buy fifteen-cent dress goods called "linen suitings." It is impossible to sell 
genuine linen at such a price. TTie fifteen-cent material is cotton, starched and glazed to make 
it look like linen. 

The quality of the material depends on the strength of the fibers, the fineness or coarse- 
ness of the fabric, its weave, color and method of finish. 



444 



PROPER ATTITUDE OF THE BODY 

(Iowa State College Bulletin) 

Chest — Cultivate the habit of holding the chest up and out. This enlarges the chest 
cavity and strengthens the lungs. It allows an increased amount of oxygen to enter the 
lungs and so aids in the oxidation of food. 

If the chest is raised the diaphragm is raised, and pressure is removed from the organs 
below the diaphragm. The habit of walking, sitting and standing with the chest dropped 
and sunken not only weakens the lungs, but it weakens the organs below the diaphragm, be- 
cause it throws too much weight upon them. 

It is also true that the raised chest gives one a feeling and appearance of courage and 
efficiency that can never be enjoyed by the person with the dropped and sunken chest. 

Shoulders — Hold the shoulders down and back. This position enlarges the chest cav- 
ity and so strengthens the entire body. 

Precautions — Have the kitchen sink and the ironing table high enough to prevent the 
necessity of stooping. Stand erect while using the broom. Do not make the work more 
difficult by standing in an unnatural cramped position. 

Do not allow the child to acquire the habit of reading with the eyes too near the 
book. This not only injures the eyes, but it compresses the chest and weakens the organs 
below the diaphragm. 

Abdomen — Stand with the abdomen "sucked in" and the chest forward. If the body 
is held in this position, the weight of the body will be thrown upon the ball of the foot and 
the body will be relieved of much jar. '^jfe!''!-*"" 

Prevention of Jar — The ball of the foot is a springy, elastic cushion which is intended 
to bear the weight of the body. Its elasticity prevents jar upon the spinal cord, while the 
habit of walking with full weight upon the heels throws much of the jar upon the delicate 
spinal cord that lies within the bony spinal column. Nature has also protected this deli- 
cate cord by placing spongy, bone cushions between the vertebrae of the spinal column. 

Walking Up Stairs — Stand erect, take a full breath, hold the chest out and the chin up. 
With the body in this position, climbing stairs is not difficult. It is only when the shoulders 
are bent, the diaphragm low^ered, the chest compressed and the chin lowered that climbing 
stairs is difficult. 

Relaxation of Muscles — When a muscle is not in use, let it rest. The tightening of the 
muscles deprives the body of energy. Do not waste that energy. The muscles of the face 
can in no way aid in the process of walking and yet how frequently one sees the muscles of 
the face all tense and stiff as one walks along the street. Those rigid muscles mean en- 
ergy wasted. Learn to relax the muscles frequently. They become tired, just as the eye 
would if it were constantly contracted to decipher very fine print.

SECTION IX. 



MOTHER AND BABY 

AND THE GROWING CHILD C 




THE EXPECTANT MOTHER— HER FOOD 

Most of both the mental and physical suffering usual to the expectant 
mother — the fear and doubts, the helplessness, the hopelessness, as well as the 
headaches, dizziness, heart-burn, faintness and loss of appetite — spring from the 
same cause: the wrong food wrongly eaten, and the pampering and lack of exer- 
cise and fresh air to which the woman resigns herself as a matter of course. 

For ages, diet for the prospective mother has been based on superstition 
and old wives' tales. Both mother and child have suffered. Some women over- 
eat on the supposition that they must "feed two." Others actually starve them- 
selves in the belief that this will reduce the size of the baby or soften its bones, 
or perform some other imaginary function of worse than only imaginary desir- 
ability. 

Years ago midwives believed sick pregnancies the only safe ones, and were 
dubious over the mother who awaited the coming of her baby in health and con- 
tent. Science has dissipated such insanity. The safest and in every way desir- 
able delivery is the one approached with cheerfulness and in perfect health ; it will 
usually be attended with less pain and most probably free from unpleasant after- 
consequences. ' 

And the best means, practically the only means, for attaining this health 
and cheerfulness is moderate daily exercises in the oF>en, fresh, clean air and out- 
of-doors — not over-exercise, of course, not jumping, running, climbing or lifting — 
and proper diet — with emphasis again on this item — proper diet. 

These things are essential to the health of a woman at all times; but a 
woman who during the most of her days may ignore the question of perfect 
health, will be pretty certain to crave it now, for her baby's sake as well as her 
own. And the secret of it is the same at this time as at any other — only this is 
the time w^hen she will take notice of it. 

The woman must choose her food for its nutritive qualities rather than its 
quantity, and must eat inteligently — and again not too much. Her dizzy spells, heart- 

447 



448 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Section IX— MOTHER, BABY, CHILD 

burn, headaches and other ills, are almost all merely from indigestion. She does not 
take her usual exercise, and she is more subject than normal to indigestion. There 
are no special weird and mysterious differences in her functions due to the preg- 
nancy. 

Get that one sane fact well fixed in your mind, expectant one, and half 
your battle is over! Follow usual common sense in feeding yourself, only be a 
little more particular than ordinarily. Don't try to work out mysterious, theoret- 
ical ideas of w^hat the child needs — he needs ■what you need. Get yourself in per- 
fect physical trim and keep yourself so; feed yourself simple, wholesome, nourish- 
ing food such as agrees with you and builds up your health and strength. Nature 
will select from the store of your own nourishment what the child needs — and no 
more. Especially, how^ever, don't over-eat — don't clog the system w^ith too much, 
don't give it food too rich, until the intestines, poisoned, perhaps constipated, vs^ith 
undigested and indigestible matter, send back the poisons therefrom into the blood. 

All of w^hich, after all, as above stated, resolves itself into simple rules you 
ought to observe all the time, but probably — well don't, and more or less won't 
— except at this time for your baby's sake. 

A PROPERLY BALANCED DIET 

A balanced diet for the prospective mother — and for practically everybody else — 
should be about as follows (it will vary vfith different physical or digestive temperaments) : 

There should be some fresh (uncooked) food every day. This may be fruits or 
such vegetables as tomatoes and lettuce. Figs or evaporated prunes may take the place 
of fresh fruits if the latter are not always obtainable. Stewed fruits rank next. The seeds 
of berries should be removed by straining or otherwise. If raw apples, melons, pineapples, 
etc., cause indigestion, nine chances to one they are not properly masticated and if scraped 
or mashed instead of taken in bites or chunks the soft pulp will cause no distress whatever. 

Vegetables easily digested are white and sweet potatoes thoroughly cooked and 
mashed or creamed, peas, rice, lima beans, onions, well cooked, tomatoes, carrots, aspara- 
gus, spinach, string beans, lettuce, beets, Brussels sprouts. 

Coarse cereals, such as oats, wheat, barley, are good breaikfast foods. Breads are 
best if made from corn-meal and unbolted or whole wheat flour rather than fine white flour. 

In meats, chicken, turkey, beef, lamb and fish take leadership. 

Milk and eggs should lead over all; they contain every property needed. They pall, 
however, if not varied with other foods. 

If you live in the country and have plenty of fresh eggs, milk, butter, vegetables, 
and a supply of chickens, you need not worry much about your diet as a prospective mother, 
except to see to the addition of some fruit and that you eat cornbread or whole wheat bread 
for about half of your bread indulgence. 

Summing up: The prospective mother, as well as every other woman, should have 
a diet of a little meat, a generous allowance of fruits and vegetables — and much water, milk 
(or other wholesome liquids) — and then — more wattf and more milk. 

ARRANGEMENT OF MEALS 

During the last two or three months of pregnancy, one rule usual at other times may 
be varied. When the child is attaining its greatest grovrth, the energy amd strength of the 
mother is greatly drawn upon, and she begins to need more than normal nourishment. This 
should be met by eating oftener than three times a day — not by more abundant meals. The 
meals should all be light and simple.

For this period a good menu is about as follows: 

Breakfast — Fruit, egg or cereal, coarse bread, toasted or plain, beverage (preferably 
milk) — a very little coffee if a stimulant is needed. 

Mid-Forenoon — Milk, egg-nog (mild), gruel or broth, oatmeal or Graham wafers. 

Noon Meal — Meat, vegetables, salad with a simple cream dressing, light dessert, 
custard, fruit or ice. 

Mid-Afternoon — Grape juice or other fruit juice or fruit pulp, glass sweet milk or 
buttermilk, cracker or biscuit. 

Supper — Meat or consomme, fish, cold cereal, wafers, stewed fruit. 

Bed-Time — Milk (malted preferred), gruel of corn-meal, made with milk and water. 

At each of the above meals eat lighdy and stop while still a little hungry.

FOR HIS MAJESTY HIMSELF 

Bed for Baby — A clothes basket makes an excellent bed for a young child. 
Choose the ordinary oblong basket and line it w^ith pale blue silk or silesia, drawing 
the lining down far enough to cover the outside and gathering it to fit neatly around 
the bottom. If desired, wadding may be placed between the basket and lining. 

Make a soft little mattress to fit the bottom, and sew around the edges of 
the basket a flounce of lace deep enough to nearly reach the floor. A dainty 
canopy may be made by shaping over one end of the basket wires or small willovs^ 
boughs on which a piece of lace or swriss has been shirred; and the narrow ruffle 
of lace decorating the front edge of the canopy may be tied back with dainty blue 
ribbons. 

A Trunk for Baby's Clothes — A plain matting or cretonne covered shirtwaist box is 
the best kind of a trunk for baby. Get one about thirty inches long and sixteen wide. Make 
a tray twenty inches long and naul cleats inside the box to rest it on. It will slide back and 
forth and can be removed without effort. The tray holds a pin cushion, soap, toilet articles, 
etc., while there is abundant room for clothing in the bottom. 

The ChOd's Bath — One can introduce play and fancy into so many things connected 
with the daily necessaries that are often so disagreeable to children. What ordeal is worse 
for the average child than being "scrubbed"? 

A Pretty Towel embroidered in yellow ducks affords an element of attraction in the 
bathing hour; if done in the simple tapestry stitch the embroidering of the ducks will take 
but a short time. Sometimes towels can be obtained already stamped for the illustration; if 
one cannot be found, trace it with carbon upon the towel. Work over the outline thus, 
transferred in yellow, insert a black eye, and the duck is complete. One duck placed after 
the other, in a line, and a blue patch of tapestry stitch at the end of the towel 'will make 
the ducks appear as though they are waddling toward a pond. The towel can be simply 
hemmed, hemstitched or scalloped, and buttonhole stitched in white mercerized twist. 

The Small Washcloths can be decorated with a fish in outline stitch or a tiny boat. 
A make-believe game of "Going to the Seashore" will ofttimes bring an otherwise reluctant 
child willingly to the dreaded tub. 

If the child is quite small, a rubber doll that he may take into the tub with him will 
give untold delight. 

Diet for Young Children — Questions are often asked as to exactly what a child may 
be allowed to eat during the period between the first and second birthdays. There are cer- 
tain broad rules which can be laid down. Milk looms large as a food — not as a drink, please, 
for which plain water should be given — with broth, gravy, boiled fish and chicken, bread 
crumbs soaked in bacon fat, a properly boiled egg or only the yolk, if the white has been 
allowed to get tough and hard, and always some rusks to chew and nibble. 

Vegetables Valuable — At eighteen months old a further stride can be made, and 
mutton or broth freshly roasted may be given, first in small quantities. Here you will gen- 
erally find it best to pound the meat. However, if the child has the inestimable advantage 
of a good digestion (which it should have, barring some hereditary delicacy or the sad re- 
sults of bad treatment) and has learned already to eat slowly and bite its food properly, 
there is no reason why the meat should not be given simply cut up. It is far better then, 

451 



452 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Section IX— MOTHER, BABY. CHILD 

for the child is using the teeth as well as accustoming himself to eat properly, and although 
it takes a little longer for the feeding process the time is well spent. 

It should be the aim of every one in charge of children at this age to make their 
little charges form the habit of eating slowly and masticating properly. Any amount of after 
trouble caused by the bolting of food will then be saved. 

By the time a child is two, vegetables may be made to play their own part — ^both 
potatoes and green vegetables. The latter usually have to be introduced somewhat care- 
fully and in small quantities, for children as a rule dislike them. Potatoes should be care- 
fully cooked, and it may be well to remember that the most valuable part, from the point 
of view of the growing organism, at least, is that which lies quite close to the skin, where 
only the salts so much needed are found, and this part, unfortunately, is too often peeled 
off and thrown away. 

Fruit, too, is permissible after the second birthday, if properly prepared and in good 
condition. Of course, it is often given before, but generally speaking the second birthday 
rule is a wise one. An exception may be made in favor of a slice of ripe apple, which forms 
an excellent safeguard to the teeth if eaten at the end of a meal, especially one which other- 
wise ends with soft or sweet food; and, of course, fruit juice should have been well repre- 
sented in the dietary all along. 

Stzirchy Food Dangerous — Just a -word about milk puddings. The ordinary ones 
— rice, tapioca, sago, and so on — are all simply forms of starchy food, and this is an ele- 
ment to diet which may very easily be overdone. Far more children suffer from indigestion 
from an excess of starch than is commonly realized. Indeed, usually the first thing done in 
home doctoring of the child, when digestive disturbance manifests itself, is to cut off meat or 
its equivalents and keep the child on farinaceous food, whereas precisely the opposite course 
should be followed. 

Hints for Mothers — Keep your baby away from sick people and out of crowds. 
Do not try to teach baby to stand. A healthy baby will stand and walk when strong enough 
to do so. 

Visit the school w^here you send your children, and satisfy yourself that it is sani- 
tary, properly heated, lighted and ventilated and not overcrowded. 

Give each child who goes to school a pretty folding drinking cup or a supply of 
individual paper cups. 

BABY'S HRST TEETH 

The embryonic teeth begin to develop at least six months before birth. It is prob- 
able that a nutritious diet for the prospective mother lays the foundation for healthy teeth 
in the baby and that lack of proper food for the mother may deprive both her own and 
the baby's teeth of some part of their normal vigor. 

Every child has two sets of teeth. The first set, known as the deciduous or "milk" 
teeth, is replaced beginning at about the sixth year with the permanent or "second teeth." 
Nearly all so-called "teething" troubles belong to the first period, as a disturbance is rarely 
connected with the coming of the permanent set. 

At birth each tiny tooth of both sets lies partly imbedded in a cavity of the jaw-bone, 
covered and surrounded by the softer tissues of the gum. As the baby grows, the teeth 
grow also, and if the baby is healthy they are ready to cut through the gums beginning at 
about the seventh month of life. 

There are twenty of the milk teeth, five in each half-jaw. The teeth appear in groups 
of five to eight weeks; after the second, a pause of one to three months; after the third, one 



MOTHER. BABY, CHILD— CHILD'S TEETH 



453 



of from two to three months; after the fourth, one of from two to four months. Thus, by 
the time a baby is one year old, it may have six teeth; at one and one-half years there should 
be twelve; at two years, sixteen teeth; and at two and one-half years the entire set should 
be cut. 

There is considerable variation, both as to the order in which they appear and in 
the time, so that the mother need not be alarmed if her baby does not follow the average 
as stated, but if the baby has no teeth at the end of the first year it can hardly be said to 
be developing properly; probably the diet is at fault, or some disease is retarding the growth 
of the baby in general, and the doctor should be consulted. 

THE CARE OF THE GROWING CHILD'S TEETH 

(U. S. Department of Labor, Children's Bureau) 

By the end of the second year the baby should have his milk teeth complete 
and until the sixth or seventh year, when the permanent set will begin to appear. 
These teeth must serve all the purposes that the final set will serve later. Since this 
is the time the child is learning to chew his food, a process necessary not only for 
proper digestion but for the strengthening and developing of his jaws and for the 
proper growth of the permanent teeth, it is important to keep the first teeth in the 
best possible working order. The condition of the teeth is a fair index to the general 
health of the child. < 



Until the child is old enough to use a toothbrush 
himself, the mother should wash his teeth every 
day; but as early as possible the child should 
learn to care for his own teeth. If the teeth can- 
not conveniently be cleaned after each meal, the 
mouth may at least be rinsed. Children should 
be taught that it is of special importance to wash 
the teeth and mouth after eating nuts, or any 
sweet, sticky, or pasty food. The teeth should be 
carefully cleaned at bedtime, since the fermenta- 
tion of food particles left in the mouth, which leads 
to the decay of the teeth, proceeds more rapidly 
at night, when the mouth is still. 

The child should be taught to brush the teeth 
from the gum downward or upward toward the 
cutting edge. When the teeth are brushed cross- 
wise, the tendency is to push whatever is on them 
into the cracks and crevices of the teeth or under 
the edges of the gums. The inner surfaces of the 
teeth should also be brushed up and down, and 
the grinding surfaces should be scrubbed in all 
directions; after the scrubbing is finished the mouth 
should be thoroughly rinsed with warm water. 

Some hard food, like a stalk of celery or part 
of a ripe, juicy apple, eaten at the end of a meal 
scours the surface of the teeth and leaves a fresh 
clean taste in the mouth. 



Children should be taken regularly to a good 
dentist once or twice a year after the first set of 
teeth is complete. If cavities appear they should 
be filled with soft fillings, and each tooth should 
be saved as long as possible. If the temporary 
molars are extracted before the sixth year molars 
come in, the latter will be apt to crowd forward 
into the space left vacant, and when the later 
teeth come they will be pushed out of their regular 
places, destroying the natural line of the mouth. 
The first molars furnish the grinding surfaces neces- 
sary to proper chewing of the food. If they fall 
out too soon the child is hardly able to chew hard 
or tough food, and is likely to swallow such food 
in chunks. 

The care of the child's first teeth is important 
also because the health of the permanent set is 
largely dependent upon that of the first set. The 
second teeth are much larger than the first, and, 
consequently, need more room in the gum. For 
necessary development the jaws must be given 
plenty of exercise. Consequently, the child should 
have a mixed diet, including some hard food 
which he cannot swallow without chewing. Toast, 
crusts, hard crackers, certain fruits, like apples, 
salad, vegetables, and meats, should provide the 
food elements needed for healthy teeth if the child 
is thriving.

FOOD FOR YOUNG CHILDREN 

(Elxtracts from Farmers" Bulletin No. 717, U. S. Department of Agriculture). 

A little child who is carefully fed in accordance with his bodily needs (as 
these are now understood) receives every day at least one food from each of the 
following groups: 

1. Milk and dishes made chiefly of milk (most important of 

the group as regards children's diet) ; meat, fish, poul- 
try, eggs and meat substitutes. 

2. Bread and other cereal foods. 

3. Butter and other wholesome fats. 

4. Vegetables and fruits. 

5. Simple sweets. 

As to the amounts that should be served, a good rule is to provide three 
or four glasses ( IJ-^ pints to I quart) of milk a day; an egg or its equivalent in 
moderately fat meat, fish, poultry or meat substitute; fruit and vegetables each 
once a day; 1 to 2 ounces of butter or other wholesome fat; and all the bread or 
other cereal food the child will eat. One or tw^o ounces of sugar, candy or other 
sweet (including the sugar used in cooking) may also be allow^ed, if this does not 
prevent eating the other foods mentioned.

A REVIEW OF THE DAY 

At the close of the day the mother might ask herself questions like the following to make sure 
that she has taken into account the things to which her attention has been directed: 

Did the child take about a quart of milk in one form or another) 

Have 1 taken pains to see that the milk that comes to my house has been handled in a clean way? 

If I was obliged to serve skim milk for the sake of cleanliness or economy, did I supply a little 

extra fat in some other way) 
Were the fats which I gave the child of the wholesome kind found in milk, cream, butter, and 

salad oils, or of the unwholesome kind found in doughnuts and other fried foods) 
Did I make good use of all skim milk by using it in the preparation of cereal mushes, puddings, 

or otherwise) 
Were all cereal foods thoroughly cooked) 
Was the bread soggy) If so, was it because the loaves were too large, or because they were not 

cooked long enough) 
Did I take pains to get a variety of foods from the cereal group by serving a cereal mush once 

during the day) 
Did 1 keep in mind that while cereals are good foods in themselves, they do not take the place 

of meat, milk, eggs, fruit, and vegetables) 
Did I keep in mind that children who do not have plenty of fruit and vegetables need whole- 
wheat bread and whole grains served in other ways? 
Did each child have an egg or an equivalent amount of meat, fish, or poultry? 
Did any child have more than this of Hesh foods or eggs) If so, might the money not have been 

better spent for fruits or vegetables) 
If 1 was unable to get milk, meat, fish, poultry, or eggs, did 1 serve dried beans, or other legumes 

thoroughly cooked and carefully seasoned) 
Were vegetables and fruits both on the child's bill of fare once during the day? If not. was it 

because we have not taken pains to raise them in our home garden? 



M OTHER. BABY. CHILD— FOOD FOR YOUNG CHILDREN 45 7 

Did either the fruit or the vegetable disagree with the child > If so. ought I to have cooked it 

more thoroughly, chopped it more finely, or have removed the skins or seeds? 
Was the child given sweets between meals, or anything that tempted him to eat when he was not 

hungry) 
Was he allowed to eat sweets when he should have been drinking milk or eating cereals, meat. 

eggs, fruit, or vegetables? 
Were the sweets given to the child simple, i.e.. unmixed with much fat or with hard substances 

difficult to chew. ar\d not highly flavored? 
Was the child made to eat slowly and chewr his food properly? 

A young child may be considered well fed if he has plenty of milk, bread, and other cereal food; 
an egg once a day or its equivalent in flesh foods; a small portion each of carefully prepared fruits and 
vegetables, with a small amount of sweet food after his appetite for other foods is satisfied. If there is 
too much or too little of any of these, his diet is one-sided.

FEEDING THE CHILD THE SECOND YEAR 

Much of the illness and suffering among babies commonly attributed to 
the "second summer" or to teething is actually due to errors in feeding. The baby's 
delicate digestive mechanism, accustomed to dealing only with milk, cannot all at 
once undertake the task of adjustment to a varied diet of solid foods, but must be 
strengthened by the gradual addition of new foods until the organs are trained to 
more complicated operations. The safe rule for feeding the baby is to add but 
one new food at a time to his dietary; to watch carefully the effect of each one 
and to withdraw it and return to the simpler diet at the first sign of trouble. TTiese 
rules are particularly important in summer, vs^hen a baby is more readily upset. 



The following list shows the day's meals for a 
baby in his second year: 

7 a. m. — Milk, zwieback, toast, or dried bread. 
9 a. m. — Orange juice. 
10 a. m. — Cereal, cup of milk. 
2 p. m. — Broth, meat, vegetables, stale bread, 

baked apple. 
6 p. m. — Cereal, milk, toast or bread. 
10 p. m. — Milk (may be omitted). 

Milk — At this time the baby should be taking 
about one quart of milk in 24 hours; part of this 
may be poured over the cereal. 

CereaJs — Oatmeal should be cooked three hours 
with a little salt in the water. It should be 
served without sugar, or with a very little only. 
The lighter cereals should be cooked at least an 
hour. 

Breads — Bread for young children must have 
been thoroughly baked and should be quite dry 
when used; that is, at least two days old. Tender 
toast is made by cutting thin slices from such a 
loaf and allowing them to dry still more, then 
toasting them to a delicate brown over a quick 
fire. Toast thus made is crisp all the way through 



and may be used in many ways. Many children 
will like to eat it broken into bits in broth or milk. 
Hot breads and biscuits, griddle cakes, and muffins 
are not suitable for young children. 

Fruit — The child may have a small portion of 
baked apple or prunes once a day in addition to 
his morning feeding of orange juice. The apple 
should be baked very tender, and all the skin, 
seeds, and hard parts should be removed. Prunes 
should be very carefully washed, soaked all night, 
then cooked until very tender with very little sugar. 
A small portion of the strained pulp may be given 
instead of apple, and the juice may be used also. 

Meat — The child may have about a tablespoon* 
ful of scraped meat, or a soft boiled or coddled 
egg once a day. Beef, broiled, boiled, or roasted, 
the tender part of a lamb-chop, or the delicate 
meat of chicken or fish may be used. All meat 
should be scraped or minced very fine, as no child 
of this age can be trusted to chew it properly. 

Vegetables — A small portion of some properly 
cooked green vegetables, like spinach or tender 
string beans, may be given. Such vegetables 
should be fresh. They should be cooked, then 
drained and mashed or strained through a colander.

THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Section IX— MOTHER. BABY, CHILD 



FEEDING THE CHILD OF THREE 

(Bulletin, Children's Bureau) 

At the beginning of the third year the child's diet may be increased by 
adding more solid food, especially meats and vegetables. According to the U. S. 
Department of Agriculture, every healthy child of three should have at least one 
food a day from each of the following five groups: 

1 . Milk and dishes made chiefly of milk (most important of 

this group in children's diet) ; meat, fish, poultry, and 
eggs. 

2. Bread and other cereal foods. 

3. Butter and other wholesome fats. 

4. Vegetables and fruits. 

5. Simple sweets. 



The meats should be beef, boiled, broiled, or 
roasted; lamb chops; the white meat of chicken or 
delicate fish. All meat should be free from fat, 
gristle, or bone and finely minced when given to 
the child. 

Eggs should be very soft boiled, coddled, or 
poached, or soft scrambled. Fried eggs should 
never be given to a child; but the grated or mashed 
yolk of a very hard boiled egg may sometimes be 
used. 

Meat broths made from mutton, beef, or chicken 
have little nutriment, but if these are thickened 
with arrow^root or cornstarch, and especially if 
milk is added, they become a valuable food Well- 
cooked vegetables, strained and added to warm 
milk, are not only good foods but serve to teach 
the child to like vegetables. 

Cereals should be thoroughly cooked and served 
with milk or thin cream and a very small amount 
of sugar or none. 

Bread for a child should be at least two days 
old. Toast, zwieback, or hard crackers may be 
given once or twice a day. 

Baked potatoes moistened with a little butter. 



thin cream, beef juice, or platter gravy may be 
given. 

Asparagus tips, spinach, stewed celery, squash, 
string beans, carrots, young peas, well-cooked and 
mashed, or put through a puree sieve, are all good 
for a child. A small portion of one of these vege- 
tables may be a part of the child's dinner each 
day. 

Fruits should be continually used. At this age 
sweet oranges, baked apples, or stewed prunes are 
most useful. The juice or mashed pulp of fresh 
ripe pears or peaches may be given in the third 
year, but there is much danger in using overripe 
or green fruit, as well as in giving too much. It 
is especially necessary to be careful in hot weather 
when fresh fruit decays rapidly. Bananas should 
never be given to a young child. 

A child under 4 years of age should never have 
dried or salted meats, sausage, pork, game, liver, 
kidney, goose, or duck. Fried and raw vegetables, 
hot fresh breads, cakes, and pastries, salads, candy, 
syrups, tea, coffee, beer, cider, and soda water are 
all unsuitable foods for a child.

FEEDING THE CHILD OF FOUR. 

(Bulletin, Children's Bureau) 

During the fourth year, milk still remains an important part of the child's 
food, but much of it may now be given in the form of bread and milk, milk soups, 
or milk puddings, or it may be poured over the cereal. Some children object to 
drinking milk, and in such cases it is wise to offer it under some such disguise. 
The cereal need no longer be strained, but must be very thoroughly cooked. 



The diet at this time should include all the ar- 
ticles advised for the two earlier years, with the 
addition of more meats, vegetables, and fruits. 
Baked potatoes, with a little butter, are a staple 
food at this period. Bread and butter, or toast 
and butter, and plenty of hard crusts or zwieback 
are important. Eggs or meat, such as roasted, 
boiled, or broiled beef, mutton, chicken or fish, 
should be given at least once a day. 

The child of four will probably thrive on three 
or four meals a day, the heaviest being taken in 
the middle of the day. If he appears to be hungry, 
a light lunch, such as milk, may be given in the 
interval betw^een breakfast and dinner, or between 
dinner and supper, but no nibbling should be per- 
mitted between meals. A child should be taught 
to come to the table with that vigorous appetite 
for his food which leads to good digestion and 
assimilation. 

Food should be carefully prepared to fit it to a 
child's powers and should be served in an appe- 
tizing fashion at proper intervals. Young children 
should not be offered "tastes" of the family meals, 
as this habit tends to destroy the appetite for the 
simple, rather restricted diet adapted to their need. 

Children should have an abundance of pure, cool 
drinking water. This is especially important in 
summer, when they are perspiring freely. If there 
is any doubt about the purity of the water it should 
be filtered or boiled, or both. 

Since it is always difficult for children to chew 
their food properly, it should be finely minced. 



mashed, or softened for them throughout these 
early years. 

Never under any circumstances should children 
be given coffee, tea, or strong cocoa. They should 
have no highly seasoned or spiced foods, rich 
pastries, raw vegetables, onions, corn, or cabbage. 
Bananas and all partly ripened fruit are apt to 
make trouble. 

If children are inclined to be constipated, they 
should have plenty of laxative foods. These are 
cereals, particularly oatnieal; the coarser breads, 
such as Graham and whole wheat; fruit and fruit 
juice, particularly oranges and prunes; and vege- 
tables like string beans, asparagus, and spinach. 

Many children suffer from malnutrition; that is, 
they fail to secure the food materials they need for 
development and growth, and, consequently, they 
are undersized, pale, often slow and listless, and 
do not show the eager, alert habits of healthy 
children. Malnutrition may be due to lack of 
sufficient food of any kind, to improper food, bad 
cooking, or some fault of digestion, or to illness 
w^hich makes it impossible for the child properly 
to utilize the food he eats. 

It is a w^ise precaution, therefore, if children are 
out of sorts, have decayed teeth, bad breath, or 
seem tired and disinclined to play, to have them 
examined by a good doctor, and to take all the 
trouble necessary to get them into sound eating 
habits. The neglect of these early symptoms may 
mean a lifetime of only partial health and efficiency.

FEEDING THE CHILD OF SIX 

(Iowa State College Bulletin) 

Children need mineral matter to build strong bones and good teeth. Do 
not handicap them for life by neglecting to supply these important food sub- 
stances. / 

Eggs and milk are valuable muscle building foods. A quart of milk a 
day included in the diet will help a child to make normal growth. 

The child beginning school should be carefully watched to see that he keeps 
up to a normal standard of health under the new conditions. 

A child should be taught: 

To chew his food thoroughly. 

Not to touch food with dirty hands. 

Not to eat foods that have been expKJsed to dust and flies. 

To use his own drinking cup. 



FOODS SUITABLE FOR THE CHILD OF SIX 

Breakfast — Cereals with cream, eg^s (not fried), 
stewed fruits, oranges, toast (dry or milk), rice 
with cream, bacon. 

Protein Food* Creamed eggs, macaroni with 

cheese, creamed potatoes >vith peanuts, chicken, 
beef, mutton, creamed codfish. 

Vegetables — Baked potatoes, lettuce, carrots, 
creanied onions, green peas, string beans, as- 
paragus. 

Desserts — Junket, custard, rice pudding, plain 
ice cream, sponge cake, plain cookies, fruit jelly, 
fruit gelatin with cream, fresh fruits. 

FOODS RICH IN MINERALS 

Eggs, milk, spinach, pea puree (dried peas), 
celery, ground raisins, prunes, whole ^vheat bread, 
nut bread (whole wheat), cauliflower.

MOTHER. BABY, CHILD— CLOTHING FOR THE CHILD 



465 



CLOTHES FOR THE GROWING CHILD 

(U. S. Department of Labor, Children's Bureau) 

Very much of the comfort of a child depends upon his having the right kind 
of clothing. This is especially true in summer. One hot day a mother came into 
an infant-welfare station in a large city bringing a screaming baby who would not 
be pacified. The trained and sympathetic eye of the nurse in charge saw that the 
little feet were covered with knitted woolen socks. She asked the mother to take 
them off. Immediately the screams ceased and the baby stretched his naked feet in 
delight at being relieved of the intolerable irritation. 



During the hot months, children should wear 
just as little clothing as possible. Babies require 
only a diaper and one other garment, while run- 
about babies and children up to five will be amply 
clothed in ^raist and drawers, with one outer gar- 
ment, preferably a cotton slip, apron, or rompers, 
or one of the many similar garments illustrated in 
the pattern books. 

The one-piece dress is a great boon to busy 
mothers, being easy to make and to >vash and 
iron. If the kimono sleeve is used, the dress will 
be cooler, but in some garments the set-in sleeve 
is less clumsy and wears better. Rompers, loose 
at the knee and lo^v-necked and short-sleeved, may 
be used for little girls and boys alike. Denim 
overalls are rather cumbersome for the hottest 
weather but are adapted to cool days. 

Starched, frilled, and fussy garments are all 
alike unsuitable for young children, whose clothing 
should be such as will make them perfectly com- 
fortable and permit the freest play. No child 
should have to think of his garments during the 
play hours; he should, of course, be subject to 
reasonable restrictions upon wilful or mischievous 
soiling or destruction of his clothing. 



Cotton is the best material for outside garments, 
since a child of this age should have no clothes 
that cannot be washed. Mothers disagree as to 
the comparative merits of white clothing and col- 
ored. White garments may be boiled, and thus 
the amount of rubbing necessary to get them clean 
is very greatly lessened. On the other hand, white 
dresses are soiled almost as soon as the child be- 
gins to play out of doors. It must be remembered 
that while! white or light colors show the soil 
sooner, there may be just as much actual dirt on 
the darker ones. It must also be remembered that 
light colors like blue, green, lavender, or pink are 
almost certain to fade unless they are washed with 
special care. Striped and check ginghams fade 
less than plain materials, but often shrink badly in 
washing. Such materials should be shrunk before 
being made up. Seersucker and cotton crepe ma- 
terials of many kinds have the great advantage of 
needing no ironing. These rough materials are not 
very cool, and if used for summer wear should 
have short sleeves and round neck to avoid chafing 
of the skin of the arms and neck. Percale, galatea, 
madras, and the better grades of gingham or dress 
linen are all good materials for children's clothes. 
For hot weather almost any of the thin materials 
may be used.

INDOOR GARDEN 

FLOVER5 




Every house should have growing things ^^ 
within. Where it is possible to have an outdoor gar- 
den, one confronts, of course, unlimited possibilities 
which embrace a study in themselves. 

C'\ Si'* 

it is astonishing how much may be accomplished. This 
most naturally and conveniently takes the form of the win- 
dow box, sun room box, or perhaps piazza box ; it is a constant source 
of surprise to work out how much can be grown in these to add to 
the charm of a home and make it seem that some of "God's out-of- 
doors" has been brought within. 

TTie boxes are heavy when filled with earth, hence should be made not too 
large. It is better to place two boxes end to end to fill a long space. They should 
be supported through with strong brackets. There must be holes in the bottom 
for drainage, or the earth will turn "sour;" there must be, therefore, a pan or 
other means to catch the drain and either carry it off or hold it until it dries or is 
mopped up. The boxes should be painted every two years — the color of the house 
or other woodwork next them, as it is the flowers which we want to "stand out" for 
notice, not the receptacles. 

In the bottom of the boxes should be an inch layer of gravel, charcoal, 
broken up flower pots or other coarse material; charcoal is best, as it helps sw^eeten 
the soil. The soil should be sifted; it should be obtained from a florist or should 
be made up of a mixture of humus, fine sand, rich garden soil and old stable dress- 
ing, well rotted from the cow barn. Sods may be overturned and the soil scraped 
therefrom, instead of garden soil; and bone meal is even better than stable dressing. 
The garden soil should make up about half the quantity, humus about a fourth, 
sand and fertilizer in smaller amounts. Wood ashes or chimney soot may be added, 
but not coal ashes. The whole should be w^ell mixed and by frequent turning ex- 
posed to light and rain and much sun, to "season" somewhat before using. 

Set the edge plants first, those chosen to droop over the sides, such as peri- 
winkle, sweet alyssium, moneywort, etc. If the plants to be set in a bed are of 
uneven growth, place the taller ones at the ends, especially if a window box.

The plants to select depend upon your own taste, but the background can- 
not be disregarded. On a gray house, red geraniums look well, or there are fine 
shades in pink and salmon. These colors do not look well together ; only strongly 
contrasted colors do, and not always these — white and red geraniums are too 
strong a contrast, while white goes well with pink. White flowers look especially 
well in window boxes in the evening, when they shine out brightly in the dusky 
light. 

Flowers and Children — Possibly the city child finds growing plants a more wonderful 
something than the child of the country, but a window box in the nursery is an unfailing 
delight to any child — and the child may be taught to water and tend it; and little formal 
gardens, Japanese or others, may be obtained from any city florist, all ready to transport 
bodily to the home, for nursery or for the living room. Tiny ones for the dining table are 
becoming more and more frequently seen, perhaps one of the most charming table decora- 
tions it is possible to have. 

Bulbs Indoors — Bulbs planted and grown at home are far more satisfactory than 
those bought ready to blossom. The latter have usually been "forced," are not hardy and 
will wither under any slightly adverse conditions. Buy large bulbs, not small ones; the 
latter cannot be forced and will not make large, attractive plants; all the care you can give 
them will not bring forth more blossoms than are inherently in them. 

Bulbs run through quite a list; tulips, daffodils, jonquils, narcissus, crocuses, and 
Roman and Dutch hyacinths. Consult florist from whom you buy as to how many of a given 
variety to plant in a given sized pot or box and the time required for them to grow and 
blossom; then select a variety so planned and planted that one will follow another and 
you will have some abloom throughout all the season. The florist will also instruct you as 
to soiling and which bulbs require much or little watering when in their growing stage. 

When you plant them for rooting, label them. Put them in a dark closet. Water 
occasionally if the soil and bulbs seem dry. Some varieties will root in two weeks; others 
require up to four weeks. When removed from the dark closet, put them in a dull light, 
to start their growth slowly; forced in a strong light they 'will make all foliage and no 
blossoms. Leave them in the dull light for a week or ten days. 

When you transfer to the window, give them a sunny room but not the direct sun 
all the time. If forced too fast, by too much bright sun and too warm a room, they make 
long, spindly trunks and all leaves, with few blossoms, and they do not last as long as those 
grown more normally. 

The Chinese lilies grown in water are treated about the same as bulbs grown in 
soil. Rocks or pebbles in the water are to hold them in position and give their roots some- 
thing to grasp; the pebbles do not nourish them. Smooth, clean, fairly large pebbles an 
inch or more in size are best. 

All Flowers grown in a gas lighted room, or a room with a gas heater without out- 
side vent pipe, or in a very hot room of "dry" heat, are sensitive, do not do so well as 
otherwise, and positively must have their "faces washed" (the foliage washed down thor- 
oughly) every day or two. 

Ferns and Kindred Plants — Ferns will keep in furnace heated rooms if sufficiently 
and properly watered. The Boston fern is one of the best for the purpose. 

Horseradish does well and looks well until it gets too large and harsh; it grows 
rapidly and is beautiful when young. 



INDOOR GARDEN. CUT FLOWERS— MISCELLANEOUS 469 

Parsley does well in window boxes and is decorative both there and on the meat 
platter. Some varieties of mint do well, especially mentha, which is also used for a delicious 
adjunct to iced drinks. 

Beyond the above the possibilities of indoor gardening run into opportunities of 
almost countless variety to one who will take up the art and study it out. The items here 
are only to give one a fair start along the lines simplest and easiest for beginners. 

There are wonderful possibilities in common carrots, and radishes and even beets 
are decorative as well as useful. Nasturtiums and geraniums, heliotrope, mignonette, prim- 
roses, morning glories, pansies, violets, foliage, asparagus, petunias — all are readily grown 
in window boxes both within and without the casement. 

Simple, Homely "Hanging" Plants — For a boy who loves an experiment, take a 
fat carrot and cut off its tail. Of course, the grocer has already cut off its head. Now 
scrape an opening in the top about as large as a good sized spool. Pierce the rim of the 
opening at three equi-distant points and run a string through each hole, catching the three 
strings together to form a miniature hanging basket. Hang it in a sunny window and fill it 
with water. Keep it filled — and you will be rewarded with an adorable green fernery which 
will sprout from the outside and entirely hide the carrot itself. 

Here's another hanging basket: Put a small sweet potato in a wide-mouthed bottle. 
Cut a hole in a sponge large enough for the mouth of the bottle to come through. In all the 
little holes of the sponge sow rice or bird seed. Hang it in a dark place by strings to the 
neck of the bottle, until all have sprouted. Put in a sunny window and train the potato 
vine around the strings.

THE DECORATIVE USE OF FLOWERS 

Being Extracts from Bulletin Under the Above Title Issued as Farm House Series, No. 8, 
Cornell Reading Course, State Department of Agriculture, Ithaca, N. Y. 

With no consideration of the part that structure and odor of flowers play 
in the perpetuation of plants, or their value as reservoirs of honey or as store- 
houses of medicine, this lesson deals with only their aesthetic service, "To 
minister delight to man, to beautify the earth. ' 

The term flowers, as used in the title of this lesson, refers not only to blos- 
soms, but to leaves, berries, seed packs, and any other form of plant life that has 
decorative qualities. An arrangement of flowers may be a work of art in which 
every essential of design in form and color may be exemplified. 

TO KEEP FLOWERS 

In order that flowers may keep, 2is well as to protect the plants, flowers should be 
cut, not picked nor "pulled," preferably in the morning or the evening. When cut they 
should be plunged as soon as possible into deep water and allowed to stand in a cool room 
or cellar for two or three hours before they are arranged. If some time elapses before they 
are arranged, it is better to snip the ends of the stems again. They should be placed so 
that the blossoms are supported, especially if they are fragile; often long-stemmed blossoms 
will keep much longer if "rested" in this way during the night. 

Flowers stay fresh much longer if the temperature in which they are grown can be 
maintained. Sometimes such flowers as heliotrope and dahlias will keep much longer if the 
stems are thrust into boiling water or into a direct flame for a moment, and immediately 
after plunged into cold water. Green branches cut in winter should be placed in ice water. 

Flowers keep fresh longer if the leaves below the water are removed, for the decay- 
ing vegetable matter poisons the water. If glass vases are used it would not, of course, be 
advisable to strip the leaves from the stems, but the water should be changed very fre- 
quently. The ends of the stems should not rest on the bottom of the container. With a 
large surface of water exposed to the air flowers will remain fresh longer than when the 
surface is small and confined. 

EFFECTIVE PLACING 

TTie placing of an arrangement of flowers often determines its form; therefore the 
position it is to occupy should be considered from the first. The observer's point of view 
should influence the arrangement. Some plants look their best in a jar placed on the floor. 
Pond lilies never look so well as when floating in a shallow dish on a taboret or a stand 
that is lower than an ordinary table. Some plants or bouquets are most attractive when 
placed on a window sill and silhouetted against the light. White lilies or golden glow light 
up a d?rk corner effectively. Drooping branches or vines arrange themselves naturally when 
placed on a mantelpiece or in baskets or other receptacles hung against the wall. Various 
flowers suit various moods, different occasions, different rooms. The floNvers that supply the 
most charming and intimate features of the home breakfast table would probably be out of 
place at a banquet. 

TABLE DECORATION 

No phase of flower arrangement is more constantly recurring than that of table 
decoration. Beauty resides in quality rather than in quantity, and it is often more in evi- 
dence when stem and leaf and growth are seen than when these have been obliterated by 

471 



472 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Sec. X— INDOOR GARDEN, CUT FLOWERS 

a mere mass of color. Table decoration should be so low that conversation may be gen- 
eral, and so that persons sitting opposite each other need not play hide and seek. Flowers 
with a very delicate odor, or with no odor at all, should be selected for the table. There 
may be either a central arrangement or something at each plate, or, for a very special occa- 
sion, a combination of both. Little flat water cups cost only forty cents a dozan and are 
very appropriate for certain flowers. For a small table there may be a central arrangement 
and others that are subordinate. The shape of the centerpiece should repeat the shape of 
the table; it should be round for a round table, or long and narrow if the table is that shape. 
The color of the flowers should harmonize with the color of the china and of the room. 

The decorations should be appropriate to the occasion and should reflect its spirit. 
Forget-me-nots, daisies, and buttercups are suitable for the child's birthday; rosebuds, wild 
clematis, or virgin's bovver, sweet peas and daffodils for a young girl, unless lilies, marigolds, 
black-eyed susans, peach blossoms, iris or other flowers in season happen to have a happier 
significance. Bride's roses, lilies of the valley, apple, peach, or any other fruit blossoms, 
are a good selection for the bride. For the mother's birthday, violets, many of the roses, 
and other flowers, among which her favorites should be given first choice, would be appro- 
priate. Bachelor's buttons, sweet williams, or johnny-jump-ups may suitably celebrate the 
young man's coming of age. Laurel, oak leaves, chrysanthemums (a court flower) and other 
stately blossoms would be appropriate decorations for a dinner. 

MANNER OF ARRANGEMENT 

The decorative elements in plants are line, form and color. Those plants whose 
chief attraction is in form or line should be used singly or in small groups, so that these 
qualities may be seen to best advantage. Those whose pre-eminent attraction is their 
color may be massed. Those which are thrice blessed, possessing beauty of form, line and 
color, may be arranged singly, in small groups, or in large masses, according to the charac- 
teristic to be emphasized or the place and purpose for which they are chosen. 

Line is the dominant attribute of goldenrod. One stem, or at most three, is more 
effective than a large mass. When goldenrod is bunched in the usual manner, the forceful 
grace of its wandlike stem is lost entirely; also the greenish-yellow of the flowers as seen 
in mass is disappointing. 

In orchids, lilies and iris, form is the chief element of beauty and should have first 
consideration. Such flowers should never be massed. 

Color is the dominant attraction in pansies, sweet peas, violets, and nasturtiums; 
therefore, the more of these the better. Peonies are difficult to arrange simply and singly 
and are much more splendid when massed. 

In many plants form and color are both so attractive that the plant may be selected 
for either characteristic, but in the decorative arrangement one idea should be dominant. 

The rose is one of the best examples of threefold adaptability. One long-stemmed 
rose in a slender vase, which will keep it in position, is a thing of beauty in line which should 
give joy to a whole household; a group of three at different stages of opening, with their 
leaves, is an example of beauty of form which would furnish a noble decoration; and a 
mass of full-blown roses would present a glory of color w^hich might well be the special 
decorative feature at a wedding, a graduation, or a church service in June. The chrysan- 
themum and the poppy are almost equally adaptable. 

In some cases foliage is the attractive feature, and it possesses the same elements 
of line, form and color. Rushes and grasses are lovely in line. Some varieties of oak are 
so impressive in form that they should be arranged so that the shape of each leaf in the 
spray should be seen. The acanthus and the ivy have furnished inspiration for genera- 
tions of sculptors. The begonias and many varieties of autumn foliage rival flowers in bril- 



INDOOR GARDEN. CUT FLOWERS— DECORATIVE USE 473 

liancy of color; more often, however, foliage is the background and should be subordinate 
to flowers. In many cases it is necessary to remove some of the leaves so that they do not 
compete with the flowers in interest. Carnations should preferably be arranged with their 
own foliage. Often they come from the florist accompanied by asparagus or sword ferns, 
a combination incongruous in both form and color. Perhaps some day a lover of carnations 
will develop a variety of them profuse in leafage and will grow it to furnish foliage for the 
flowering varieties. 

Nature is very careful about the foliage she uses with flowers, and uses a different 
green with white lilacs from the one she uses with the colored species. At times she sends 
the flowers before the leaves, as in the case of the azaleas and many of the fruit blossoms, 
so that the contrasting character of the erratic stems is not missed. There are always leaves 
when violets and sweet peas and nasturtiums bloom. Fewer blossoms with a little of the 
foliage make a much more attractive arrangement than a mass of blossoms and no leaves. 
Even though buds must be picked with the blossoms in order to secure enough foliage, it 
should be considered no sacrifice since they, too, contribute to the general effect. 

The nature of the plant growth should suggest the manner of arrangement. Branches 
of trees should be arranged so that their strong, rugged character is preserved. Vines 
should appear to run or droop or climb. When grace and delicacy distinguish plants these 
characteristics should not be lost in arrangement. 

Whole plants, such as the primrose, the cyclamen, and many bulbs, such as daffo- 
dils, jonquils, and tulips, furnish a ready-made arrangement difficult to equal. Violets or 
hepaticas, ripple grass or dandelions, carefully selected and sometimes judiciously pruned, 
are charming. One bit of sod from a New England pasture has been known to furnish ten 
varieties of plants, and is a wild garden in itself. Taken early in March and brought into 
the favoring warmth of the house, it is a prophecy of the spring easily read by a family of 
children, who receive thereby a vision of the beauty of a little grass plant not so easily per- 
ceived when the plants come in battalions. 



474 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Sec. X— INDOOR GARDEN. CUT FLOWERS 



CARE OF FLOWERS AND PLANTS 



Insects — With regard to potted plants generally 
one should chase the wooly white mealy bugs and 
little red ants away with a toothpick. Drown the 
red spider with a squirt gun. 

If bugs and spiders shatter your preparedness 
program, cut plants off within an inch of their 
lives and throw them away. They'll grow again. 

The green flies, which are not so green as they 
look, w^on't bother your plants if you keep them 
w^ell bathed and fed — the plants, not the flies. 

When a fern turns yelloiv, slice a raw potato 
and put it on top of soil; this w^ill draw^ out the 
worms, w^hich are generally the cause. 

Ammonia water applications are good for plants 
that do not seem to thrive. Soapy water is also 
good for the soil about plants. 

Ivy — The hardy ground ivy will thrive in almost 
any situation, even in a room not always well 
lighted. Select two or three pieces of ivy, each 
about a yard in length, place the ends in a two- 
quart jar kept filled with water. Twine the plant 
about the pedestal of a statue. 

Rubber Plants need a sun-bath every day. Their 
feet should be kept damp but not wet. The leaves 
should be washed twice a week in good soap suds 
and rinsed in clear water. When the pots get too 
full of roots, repot the plants. Every rubber plant 
should have a prepared food "square meal" twice 
a month. Give it also a dose occasionally of 
diluted ammonia. 

Palms — Add some milk to the water with which 
you wash palms. This causes the leaves to shine, 
and helps their good health. 

Mint will grow in water, as many other plants, 
if left in a sunny window and given plenty of air. 

Lettuce can be kept growing all summer, from 
the early varieties started in boxes in the house 
to endive, the lettuce of autumn, which may be 
sown from June to August. Endive is tender as 
a young plant but bravely withstands the early 
frosts. 

Onion Crates Tabourets — By removing the thin 
slats from the top and bottom of onion crates and 
removing the wire of the corners until the sides 
have been interlaced, then replacing the wires and 
fastening securely, they make excellent fern stands. 
They can be stained or painted any desired color, 
and are really very attractive. 



To Prevent Broken Pots and Flowers — Flower 
pots on piazza railings are easily knocked off, and 
both pot and flower broken. All flower pots have 
holes in the bottom. Nail a small-headed nail about 
three or four inches long on the top of the ban- 
isters, over which slip the pot and all the trouble 
is ended. 

To clean flower pots and trays of brass, rub them 
with a piece of lemon, pour boiling w^ater over 
them, and finally polish them with a soft dry cloth. 

Tea leaves, moistened with vinegar, remove the 
discoloration in glass caused by flow^ers. 

To clean deep flower vases, mix a tablespoonful 
of coarse salt and a gill of vinegar. Pour in the 
vase and let it stand for a while. Shake well and 
rinse with clear w^ater. 

Care of Cut Flowers — The principal drawback 
to cut flowers is that they wither quickly. Some 
seem to have more luck than others in keeping 
them fresh. For instance, in the matter of violets, 
it is impossible to w^ear them several times without 
noticing the overpowering stale odor which pro- 
claims them beyond redemption. 

Keep Wrapped — Of course, many people find 
that they cannot w^ear cut flowers even for one 
afternoon, because the body heat seems to wilt 
them, but if this can be avoided it is quite possible 
to find a bunch almost as fresh the second day as 
on the first, if properly guarded overnight. 

Keep the box that your violets came in and 
when you take them off hold the stems under 
running water for a few minutes, taking care not 
to wet the violets themselves. Then wrap them 
up in the oiled paper and put them back in the 
covered box outside the w^indow^, if it is cool, or 
in the refrigerator; but in either case keep them 
w^rapped. 

Preservation — This treatnient seems to restore 
the flowers and hold in them the delicious odor 
which so soon becomes rank if they are kept un- 
wrapped in a close room. 

Some find that a pinch of salt in the water will 
keep cut flow^ers fresh longer; and so it does in 
some cases. In others it seems to change the color 
a little. With roses it is successful, but not so 
much so with violets. A piece of gum camphor 
is said to be an excellent preservative in the water. 
Others advocate a small lump of charcoal. In any 
case, the water should be changed daily and the 
flowers kept in a cool place overnight.

SUGGESTIONS FOR UTILIZING 
LIMITED AREAS 

(Fanners' Bulletin No. 818, U. S. Department 
of Agriculture, in Its Entirety 
"The Small Vegetable Garden") 

O ESSENTIALS OF GARDENING 

The primary needs for successful vegetable gardening on a small scale are 
the same as those for gardening on a large scale. On limited plots, however, 
greater emphasis must be placed on intensive culture and carefully arranged rota- 
tions so that every available foot of space may be made to produce the maximum 
yield. 

The essentials of all gardening are soil of suitable texture containing avail- 
able plant food, water to dissolve the plant food so that the plant rootlets may 
make use of it, seeds or plants which will produce the desired crops, sunshine and 
warmth to bring about germination and plant development, and cultivation. Much 
also depends upon the gardener and the care he bestows on his enterprise. 

Other factors — location and exposure — cannot always receive much consid- 
eration in gardening small plots since there is ordinarily little room for choice. 
Such spaces are located usually in yards, or the choice of location is restricted in 
other ways by the necessity that the spaces be accessible to dwellings. When a 
possibility for the exercise of choice does exist, however, several considerations 
should be kept in mind by the gardener. It should be recognized that frost is less 
likely to injure vegetables planted on high ground than those planted in low places 
or valleys into which the heavier cold air commonly settles; that crops will mature 
more rapidly on land that has a sunny, southern exposure than on other plots; that 
the garden should be fairly level, but well drained; and that a warm, sandy loam 
will produce an earlier crop than a heavier soil that retains more water and less 
heat. 

The soil is the storehouse of plant food and should, therefore, have a 
relatively open texture so that the rootlets of vegetables may extend themselves 
readily in their search for sustenance. A high proportion of humus or rotted vege- 
table material is desirable in the soil, since it produces an open texture, adds nitrogen,

478 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Section XI— KITCHEN GARDEN 

insures the presence of beneficial bacteria, aids in unlocking plant food from mineral 
particles, and increases the moisture-retaining properties of the soil. 

About 50 per cent, of ordinary earth is not soil at all, but consists of eiir 
and water. Water makes the soluble plant food that is present in the soil freely 
available, while the air in the soil makes possible bacterial development and facili- 
tates chemical action, which makes additional plant food available. 

IMPORTANCE OF A GOOD SEED BED 

The cultivation of crops is important because the stirring and loosening of the soil 
directly conserves moisture to some extent, kills weeds, which draw moisture and plant food 
at the expense of the crops, and incorporates air into the soil. 

Too much emphasis cannot be laid on the preparation of a good seed bed. A seed 
bed of fine tilth — made such by deep plowing, careful harrowing, and fining of the soil — 
is the foundation of good gardening. It is essential for the proper germination of seeds and 
growth of young plants. The soil must be friable and free from clods. A clod locks up 
plant food and prevents its utilization by the plant. Good soil and fine tilth furnish best 
conditions for root development. Upon the fine, hairy, fibrous, feeding roots, which are 
possible only in well-tilled soil, the plant depends for its stockiness and growth. 

The careful gardener will regard his whole garden as a seed bed and will cultivate 
and fertilize it accordingly. 

FERTILIZERS 

Fertilizers, the plant foods for the garden, should be carefully selected. Nitrogen, 
which stimulates leaf growth, is best supplied by turning under rich, well-rotted or com- 
posted manure or rotting vegetable matter. Sheep manure and poultry droppings will hurry 
plants along more rapidly than most chemical fertilizers. These substances, as well as bone 
meal, also a valuable fertilizer, usually may be obtained from seed stores. 

PLANNING THE SMALL GARDEN 

With a little forethought a comparatively small tract of land may be made to supply 
the average family with fresh vegetables throughout the growing season. Most owners of 
small gardens are content to raise a single crop on each plot of land at their disposal. It 
is quite possible, however, to grow two or three crops of some vegetables in one season, 
and if these are properly selected the home-grown produce should be both better and 
cheaper than any that can be purchased on the market. 

Just what vegetables are to be grown depends, of course, upon the individual tastes 
of the family. In general, the aim of the home gardener should be to raise vegetables in 
which freshness is an important quality. Peas, string beans, Lima beans, asparagus, and 
sweet corn, for example, lose much if they are not cooked almost immediately after they 
are picked. On the other hand, as good potatoes usually can be bought as can be grown. 
Moreover, potatoes occupy a large area in proportion to their yield and consume in a back 
yard or small garden valuable space which, in most cases, could be put to much more profit- 
able use. This may be true also, in some cases, of corn, cucumbers, squashes, and melons. 

It will pay the home gardener to grow certain specialties of which he may be fond, 
and which may be troublesome or expensive to purchase. Okra is an example of this class, 
and little beds of parsley, chives, or other herbs take up very little room and provide the 
housewife with additions for her table, ^vhich are most welcome if they can be picked at the 
right moment without trouble. 

THE GARDEN DIAGRAM

economy and pleasure to the owner, every available foot of it must be made to work con-

tinuously. This can be accomplished only by careful planning, and it is recommended, 
therefore, that a complete lay-out for the garden be drawn up in advance. On the plan 
the gardener may indicate the approximate date when each of his projected crops is to be 
planted. No more space should be allotted to each than is needed to furnish a sufficient 
quantity of the vegetable for family consumption or for other known needs. In many 
cases, also, space should be left between the rows for the interplanting of later crops and for 
easy cultivation. Plants which make a high growth and cause heavy shade should not be 
located where they will interfere with sun-loving small plants. It is well also to separate 
perennials, such as rhubarb and asparagus, which are not cultivated, from plants which must 
be tilled. 

THE DIAGRAM AS A RECORD 

If a garden is planned in this way and the scheme carried out, the plan should be 
kept for use the following year, with notes of the success or failure of the different items 
in it. For example, if too much or too little of any vegetable was grown, this fact should 
be recorded. It is not desirable, however, to follow too closely the same plan in succeed- 
ing years. The same kind of vegetables should not be grown twice, if this can be avoided, 
in the same part of the garden. The danger of attack by diseases and insects is heightened 
when vegetables of the same kind follow each other repeatedly in a given space, such as 
a row or bed. If a radically different kind of plant is grown in a space, on the other hand, 
disease spores and insects, though present in the soil, probably will not attack the second 
crop. 

In making a diagram of the garden it is well to use a tough paper, such as heavy 
wrapping paper, which will stand repeated handling and use out of doors. A fairly large 
scale should be adopted, so that full notes can be kept in the spaces representing rows. 
If the garden is fairly large or abnormally long, the diagram may be made in separate 
sections for the sake of convenience. 




A BACK YARD GARDEN 

The garden shown in the diagram (fig. 1) was a city back yard, 25 by 70 feet in 
dimensions, near New York City. It happened to be bounded on two sides by a board 
fence, and advantage was taken of this fact to plant and train grape vines. Stawberry 
plants were set alongside the flagstone walks and currant bushes between the walks and 
the fence. In the space between the bushes and the strawberries low-growing vegetables, 
such as bush beans, peppers, eggplants, and the like were set out. In a space about 1 2 feet 



480 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Section XI— KITCHEN GARDEN 



wide between the walks low-growing, quick-maturing varieties of early vegetables were 
planted in such a way that later-maturing varieties could be put out at proper intervals 
between them. The early plantings consisted of radishes, early beets, lettuce, carrots, and 
a few parsnips. The beets gave way later to a few late cabbage plants. The sunniest por- 
tion of the yard was turned over to tomatoes, of which there were about a dozen plants 
trained to a single stem and set about 1 8 inches apart in each direction. Early and late 
peas were put out in the least sunny portions of the yard. Later, in the fall, spinach, kale, 
and potato-onion sets were planted in order to provide a supply of green succulents for the 
wnter and early spring. 

IMPORTANCE OF SUNUGHT 

In making the garden plan the gardener should recognize that no amount of fer- 
tilizer, watering, and cultivation will make up for the absence of sunlight in a garden. 
Careful consideration should be given to how many hours a day any part of the yard is 
in shadow from buildings, fences, or trees. If a successful garden is to be maintained, the 
greater portion of the plot must have at least five hours of sunlight a day. As a rule, 
foliage crops, such as lettuce, spinach, and kale, do fairly well in partial shade, but even 
these need sunshine two or three hours a day. Plants which must ripen fruits, such as 
tomatoes and eggplant, should have the sunniest locations. 

CHOOSING CROPS 

Vegetable seed should be ordered in advance of the time for planting in the open, 
so that they will be on hand for planting in flats or frames, and also for use outdoors, as 
soon as the weather and the condition of the soil make planting possible. Before ordering 
seed it is a good idea to look over the garden plot, decide on the best location for each 
vegetable, and determine how much seed will be required for the space available for each 
variety. Tlie garden plan may then be drawn. 

SEED FOR A FAMILY OF FOUR 

The following are the approximate quantities of seed that should be purchased for 
a garden which is to supply vegetables for successive plantings throughout the season for a 
family of four: 

Beans, snap I pint Parsnips J/2 ounce 

Beans, pole Lima |/2 pint Salsify I ounce 

Beans, bush Lima Yz pint Squash, summer !/2 ounce 

Cabbage, early Yl ounce Squash, Hubbard type Yl ounce 

Carrot 1 ounce Cauliflower I packet 

Celery I ounce Eggplant I packet 

Cucumber Yl ounce Parsley I packet 

Kale, or Swiss chard Yl ounce 

For most of the vegetables listed the planting may consist of the entire quantities 
mentioned. Relatively small quantities of cauliflower, eggplant and parsley will be sufficient 
for most families, however. 

Tlie following vegetables undoubtedly will be planted in larger amounts than those 
just mentioned, and the amounts of seed given will be a guide for ordinary requirements. 
Some families may need more of the various vegetables and others less: 

Beet 2 ounces Radish I ounce 

Cabbage, late Yl ounce Spinach |/4 pound in 

Corn, sweet 1 pint spring and Yl 

Lettuce Yl ounce pound in fall 

Muskmelon I ounce Tomatoes, late '/^ ounce 

Onion sets 2 quarts Turnips 1 ounce 

Peas, garden 2 to 4 quarts 



KITCHEN GARDEN— ESSENTIALS AND PLANNING 481 

The entire supply of seeds of string bean, bush Lima bean, sweet corn, lettuce, 
peas, and radish should not be planted at one time, but successive plantings two to three 
weeks apart should be made so that a fresh supply of the vegetables may be had throughout 
the season. 

Of early Irish potatoes one peck to half bushel will be required, and of late potatoes 
half bushel to I bushel, or more, depending upon the amount of ground available for this 
purpose. If abundant space is available, it may be well to grow enough Irish potatoes to 
last throughout the w^inter. 

If the family wishes to raise vegetables to supply current needs and also to supply 
a surplus for canning, the amounts indicated above should be increased considerably.* 

AIDS TO EARUNESS 

The hotbed, the "flat" or seed box, and the cold frame are the gardener's greatest 
aids in raising early crops. The hotbed and the flat enable him to plant seed and produce 
seedlings long before most of the seeds may be planted out of doors and before those 
which have been planted in the plot have begun to germinate. The cold frame enables 
him to get the seedlings produced in the hotbed gradually accustomed to outdoor condi- 
tions and to raise these into strong, sturdy planting stock by the time the garden is ready for 
them. Resetting from a hotbed into a cold frame, or from one flat into another, or into pots, 
gives most plants a better root system and makes them stockier and more valuable for trans- 
planting into the open ground. Besides being used in hardening plants that have been 
started in the hotbed, the cold frame is utilized in mild climates instead of a hotbed for 
starting plants before seeds can be planted safely in the open. In the extreme South the 
cold frame is much more extensively used than the hotbed, but each has its place in garden 
economy. 

Still another method of giving plants an early start is used extensively for beans, 
cucumbers, melons, sweet corn, and other warmth-loving plants. This consists in planting 
enough seeds for a "hill" in berry boxes filled w^ith soil. The boxes are kept in the house 
or in greenhouses until the garden soil becomes warm, by which time the plants should have 
reached a considerable degree of development. The bottoms of the boxes are then cut 
away and the remaining frame is sunk with the plants in their permanent location in the 
garden. 

STARTING EARLY VEGETABLES IN THE HOUSE 

The flat or seed box, which is kept in the house, is perhaps the most practical 
device for use by the home gardener for starting early vegetables. By its use earlier crops 
of tomatoes, cabbage, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, peppers, eggplant, and lettuce can be 
had w^ith little outlay for equipment. Early potatoes sometimes are forced in the same way. 
Seeds so planted germinate and are ready for transplanting by the time it is safe to sow 
the same kind of seed in the open ground. When danger of frost is over and the soil is 
dry enough to work, therefore, the early garden may be started with seedlings well above 
the surface. Transplanting, if properly done, instead of injuring seems to help such plants 
to develop a strong root system.

482 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Section XI— KITCHEN GARDEN 

HOW TO MAKE AND USE A SEED BOX 

Any sort of wooden box filled with good soil answers the purpose, but the follow- 
ing specific suggestions for a box of convenient size may be useful. Construct a box 3 to 
4 inches deep, 12 to 14 inches wide, eind 20 to 24 inches long. A layer of about 1 inch 
of gravel or cinders should be placed in the bottom of the box. It should then be filled 
nearly full with rich garden soil or soil enriched with decayed leaves or mcinure. The rich 
soil beneath the family woodpile or around decaying logs is splendid for this purpose. The 
soil should be pressed down firmly with a small piece of board and rows made one-fourth 
to one-half inch deep and 2 inches apart crosswise of the box. The seeds should be dis- 
tributed 8 or 1 to the inch in the rows and be covered. The soil should be watered and 
the box set in a warm place in the light. The best location is just inside a sunny window. 
Water enough must be given from time to time to cause the seeds to germinate and grow 
thriftily, but not enough to leak through the box. If a piece of glass is used to cover the 
box, it will hold the moisture in the soil and hasten the germination of the seeds. 

When the plants are from an inch to an inch cind a half high they should be 
thinned to 1 or 2 inches apart in the row, so as to give them space enough to make a 
strong, stocky growth. If it is desired to keep the plants which are thinned out, they may 
be set 2 inches apart each way in boxes similar to the seed box. When the weather 
becomes mild the box of plants should be set out of doors part of the time so that the 
plants will "harden off" in preparation for transplanting to the garden later. A good water- 
ing should be given just before the plants are taken out of the box for transplanting, so 
that a large ball of earth will stick to the roots of each one. 

THE HOTBED 

Locate the hotbed in some sheltered but not shaded spot which has a southern 
exposure. The most convenient size is a box-like structure 6 feet wide and any multiple 
of 3 feet long, so that standard 3 by 6 foot hotbed sash may be used. The frame should 
be 1 2 inches high in the back and 8 inches in the front. Tliis slope is for the purpose of 
securing a better angle for the sun's rays and should be faced toward the south. 

The hotbed not only must collect any heat it cein from the sun, but also must gen- 
erate heat of its own from fermentation in fresh manure. Fresh horse manure, free from 
stable litter, is best for generating heat. 

If the hotbed is to be ein annual affair, make an excavation 1 8 inches to 2 feet 
deep, about 2 feet greater in length and width than the frame carrying the sash. Line the 
excavation with plank or with a brick or concrete wall. A drain to carry off surplus water 
is essential. This may consist of either tile or pipe extending to a low portion of the garden 
or a trench partially filled with coarse stones covered with a layer of hay or sod and then 
filled level with soil. 

After a sufficient amount of fresh horse manure has been accumulated fill the hot- 
bed pit, and while it is being filled tramp the manure as firmly and as evenly as possible. 
When the ground level is reached, place the frame in position and bank the sides and ends 
with manure. Place about 3 inches of good garden loam on top of the manure inside the 
frame and cover it with the sash. After the heat has reached its maximum and has sub- 
sided to between 80 and 90 degrees F., it will be safe to plant the seeds. Select the 
plumpest, freshest seeds obtainable. Use standard varieties, and get them from reliable seed 
houses. 

Keep the bed partially dark until the seeds germinate. 

After germination, however, the plants will need all the light possible, exclusive of 
the direct rays of the sun, to keep them growing rapidly. TTiis is a crisis in plant life, and 



KITCHEN GARDEN— ESSENTIALS AND PLANNING 483 

ventilating and watering with great care are of prime importance. Too close planting and 
too much heat and water cause the plants to become spindling. Water the plants on clear 
days, in the morning, and ventilate immediately to dry the foliage and to prevent mildew. 

THE COLD FRAME 

The cold frame, so useful in hardening plants started in the hotbed and for start- 
ing plants in mild climates, is constructed in much the same way as the hotbed, except 
that no manure is used, and the frame may be covered either with glass sash or with czmvas. 
A cold frame may be built on the surface of the ground, but a more permanent structure, 
suitable for holding plants over winter, will require a pit 18 to 24 inches deep. The cold 
frame should be filled with a good potting soil. The plants should have more ventilation 
in the cold frame, but should not receive so much water. It is best to keep the soil rather dry- 
In transplanting, remember that plants usually thrive better if transplanted into 
ground that has been freshly cultivated. Transplanting to the open field is best done in 
cool, cloudy weather and in the afternoon. This prevents the sun's rays from causing the 
plant to lose too much moisture through evaporation. In transplanting the gardener will find 
a child's express wagon an excellent trolley tray for bedding out his seedlings. 

TOOLS 

The necessary tools for preparing and caring for the small garden are few. A 
spade or garden fork for digging, a hoe, a steel-tooth rake, a trowel, and a dibble or 
pointed stick complete the list of essentials. The gardener will find it convenient, however, 
to possess some additional implements. If tree roots underlie any portion of the garden 
plot and must be cut away, a hatchet, ax, or mattock will be a real necessity. If the soil 
of the plot has become compacted, as where walks have existed, a pick may be needed 
for digging. Perhaps in such cases it will be most economical to fill both cutting and 
digging needs by purchasing a pick-ax which has a pick point at one end of the head and a 
cutting blade at the other. Apparatus for watering plants also should be included. This 
may be a watering pot of generous proportions or, where running water is aveiilable, a hose. 
In order that rows may be made straight and uniform a substantial line or cord should be 
provided. 

A most convenient implement for use in the home garden, especially where the 
plot is fairly large, is a hand cultivator or wheel hoe. This implement is a miniature cul- 
tivator or plow, with adjustable blades, mounted on a wheel or wheels, and is pushed along 
by hand. Attachments make possible either the turning of small furrows, the stirring of the 
soil, or the removal of weeds. Much time and labor may be saved by such a device. 

Among the other implements which may be useful in the home garden but which 
are not essential are planting and cultivating hoes of special shapes, a combination hoe and 
rake, a wheelbarrow, a shovel, hand weeding tools, and other small implements for special 
uses. 

PREPARING THE SOIL 

A simple test to determine when garden soil is ready for plowing or working is to 
take a handful of earth from the surface and close the fingers tightly on it. If the earth 
compacted in this way is dry enough for cultivation, it will fall apart when the hand is 
opened. TTiis test is applicable only to comparatively heavy soils, but it is these which 
receive the most injury if they are worked when wet. On such soils overzealous gardeners 
not only waste their time but frequently do actual damage by attempting to work them too 
early. 



484 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Section XI— KITCHEN G ARDEN 

BREAKING 

The kind of preparation that must be given to the small garden and the amount 
of work that will be required will depend largely, of course, on the condition of the plot 
and the use to which it has been put. If the ground selected for the garden has been 
firmed by much tramping, as is often the case in back yards, it cannot be got into proper 
condition without the expenditure of considerable labor. When plowing with a team can 
be practiced, that is the best method for giving the ground its initial breaking. The surface, 
of course, should be harrowed a ssoon as possible after plowing. 

If the plot cannot be plowed, the gardener must resort to the use of a garden fork 
or spade, or in the case of very hard spots, a mattock. The soil should be well loosened 
to the depth of the spade or fork. If heavy clay is encountered at this depth, it should 
not be turned up to the surface, but the slices of soil should be kept in their normal posi- 
Sion. As soon as each spade or fork full of earth is loosened, it should be broken up by 
blows with the back of the implement. Later the freshly dug surface should be fined and 
smoothed with a steel-tooth rake. It is not sufficient that the surface be made fine; the soil 
should be well pulverized to the depth of the digging. Any sod or plant growth on the 
garden plot should be turned under to rot and form humus. In turning under sod with a 
spade or fork it is well to reverse each segment so that foliage will be down and roots up. 

The first digging of a plot of ground which has not before been cultivated is likely 
to be a laborious task, and may even take away the enthusiasm of the would-be gardener. 
After this portion of the work is done, however, the fining of the soil, planting, and culti- 
vation are not arduous. It may be well in many cases for the gardener to employ some one 
to break his ground, whether this be done with plow, spade, or fork. 

IMPROVING SOIL TEXTURE 

It is desirable that the soil of the garden be as open and light as possible. Where 
a natural loam exists in the plot good texture can be given by digging and cultivating. 
Where the soil is heavy, containing much clay, however, other steps are necessary. If clean 
sand is available this may be mixed with the soil. Well-sifted coal ashes which, unlike 
wood ashes, have no fertilizing value, are useful in lightening the soil. Care should be 
taken that no coarse cinders or pieces of partly burned coal are added to the soil with the 
ashes. 

Lime added to the soil also will tend to lighten it and will, at the same time, 
correct acidity. A thin coat of air-slaked lime should be spread on the ground and worked 
in well. Lime is not a plant food, but its function in gardening is important none the 
less. By correcting acidity it makes possible the development of countless soil bacteria 
which aid in unlocking plant food from the mineral particles of the soil and in making these 
substances available for the plants. In acid soils these helpful organisms do not thrive, and 
in their absence vegetables do not grow at their best. 

FERTILIZERS 

After the soil has been got into good mechanical condition, it usually is desirable 
to apply some form of fertilizer. Barnyard or stable manure, which furnishes both plant 
food and humus, undoubtedly is the best, and applications of from 20 to 30 tons to the 
acre are satisfactory. This is roughly equivalent to from 400 to 600 pounds, or several 
w^heelbarrow loads, for each plot 20 by 20 feet. The manure should be distributed evenly 
over the surface, and later worked in with a hoe and rake. 

Frequently it is advisable also to apply commercial fertilizer. An application of 
1,000 to 1,500 pounds to the acre, or 1 to 1 5 pounds per plot 20 feet square, usually 



KITCHEN GARDEN— ESSENTIALS AND PLANNING 485 

is sufficient. In order to supply potash, if this is needed, unleached wood ashes may 
be distributed over the garden at the rate of 1,000 pounds to the acre, or 10 pounds 
to each plot 20 feet square. Wet or leached ashes have less fertilizer value. Dou- 
ble the quantity of these should be used. In order to start the plants in the 
spring, applications of 100 pounds to the acre of nitrate of soda, of 1 pound to 
each 20-foot square, may be used. By far the best way to use nitrate of soda in the small 
garden, however, is to dissolve a teaspoonful of the chemical in a gallon of water and 
use the solution for watering young plants. It is important to remember that no form of 
commercial fertilizer will yield good results unless the soil is well supplied with humus. 
Reference already has been made to the use of prepared sheep manure as a ferti- 
lizer. When this plant food can be obtained at a reasonable price, it is perhaps the safest 
concentrated fertilizer for use by the home gardener. It will not pay to broadcast prepared 
sheep manure. Small quantities should be applied under the drill when the seeds are planted 
or the plants set out. Later applications may be worked in with a trowel around the plants. 

PLANTING VEGETABLES IN THE OPEN 
WHEN TO PLANT 

Vegetables may be divided into two classes — "cold temperature" and "warm tem- 
perature" vegetables. When peach and plum trees are in blossom, or, where these trees do 
not occur, when silver maples put forth leaves, or catkins appear on willows and poplars, 
it is time to sow in the open ground the seeds of lettuce, spinach, kale, endive, radish, pars- 
ley, beets, turnips, cabbage, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, carrots, round-seeded peas, and 
onions. The wrinkled peas should not be planted until later, as they are more likely to 
rot in cool ground than are the smooth varieties. When the apple trees bloom, or when 
the dogrwood and white oak buds unfold, it is time to plant the heat-loving vegetables, such 
as cucumbers, beans, sweet corn, okra, pumpkin, and squash. This is an old approximation 
for planting dates, but has been found in most cases to be satisfactory. 

Planting times may be fixed in still another way on the basis of the occurrence of 
frost. Frost ordinarily will kill tender growths of vegetables, but young plants of a few 
kinds will survive light frosts. Among the latter, which may be called Group I, are cabbage, 
lettuce, Irish potatoes, early peas (smooth seeded), onion seeds and sets, parsnips, salsify, 
beets, radishes, and such salad plants as kale, spinach, and mustard. 

A "second early" group of vegetables, which may be called Group II, may be planted 
as soon as danger of frost is over. In this group are included lettuce plants and seeds, 
radishes, wrinkled peas, carrots, and early sweet corn. 

A week or 1 days after the seeds and plants of Group II are placed in the ground, 
string beans and late sweet corn, constituting Group III, may be planted. 

A group of plants, which may be called Group IV, should be plcinted only after the 
ground has begun to warm up. In this group are cucumbers, melons, squashes, pumpkins, 
Lima beans, and tomato, eggplant, and pepper plants. 

Detailed suggestions for planting are given in a table hereafter. 

DEPTHS OF PLANTING 

No general rule can be given with regard to the depth for planting seeds, since 
different varieties of vegetables and different soils necessitate different practices. TTie 
smaller the seeds, usually, the.shallower the planting should be. In heavy clay or moist soils 
the covering should be lighter than in sandy or dry soils.

488 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Section XI— KITCHEN GARDEN 

SEED BEDS 

The gardener may find it desirable to reserve a small area of his garden for a seed 
bed in which some of the second crops for his rotations may be grown while the ground in 
which they are to develop is still occupied. In this way also advantage is taken of the fact 
that transplanting makes for stockiness. In seed-bed culture much the same practices are in 
force as in growing plantlets in the flats and frames. The rows of seeds, however, are not 
spaced so closely in the outdoor seed beds as in the boxes and frames. When the plantlets 
crowd they may be thinned out or transplanted to another part of the seed bed . Late cabbage, 
lettuce, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, etc., are plants that in many cases may be treated con- 
veniently in this way. 

PLANTING PRACTICES 

In planting many kinds of seeds in the garden thick sowings are made to insure a 
good stand, and the superfluous plants later are pulled up. Straight rows or drills should 
be used in all cases. The use of a line will make accuracy possible. The line is stretched 
between stakes at the ends of the row, and with this as a guide the furrow is then opened. 
This may be done with the end of a hoe or rake handle, with the comer of a hoe, or the 
point of a special furrow hoe, with a hcind plow, or with the edge of a board pressed into 
the loosened soil. Small seeds may be shaken out of the packet by hand in a thin stream 
while the packet is held close to the bottom of the furrow. Larger seeds, like peas and 
beans, may be dropped from the hand. Mechanical planters, built like wheel hoes, may 
be purchased if the size of the garden justifies their use. 

DRILLS, ROWS, AND HILLS 

Small plants which are to be left almost touching each other, as is the case with 
onions and carrots, are said to be grown in drills. Plants grown at fixed distances, as cab- 
bages or potatoes, are in rows. When plants are grown at distances of several feet apart 
in both directions they are said to be in hills. Furrows are opened for planting in both drills 
and rows. Hills, however, may be opened with a spade or trowel. An excellent method 
of using fertilizer is to apply it in the drills, rows, or hills before planting. In such cases 
the fertilizer should be mixed carefully with the soil in the bottom of the opening before 
the seeds are deposited. 

FINAL PLANTING TOUCHES 

In planting the gardener should keep in mind that to germinate and develop prop- 
erly into sturdy plants the seed must be firmly imbedded in well-fined, moist soil. The 
condition of the soil beneath the seeds is most important, since it is in this soil that the 
rootlets on emerging must find sustenance. Air spaces or cracks may cause the rootlets 
to shrivel. It is well, therefore, especially if the soil is at all dry, to force the seeds gently 
into the soil, compacting it slightly. This may be done with the back of a hoe in the case 
of small seeds, or with the ball of the foot when large seeds, such as beans and peas, are 
being planted. The seeds should then be covered immediately with soil. This should be 
very slightly compacted over the seeds with the back of the hoe. If weather conditions are 
such that there is a tendency for the soil to' bake over the drills and rows before the plants 
appear, it is well to rake very lightly with a, steel-tooth rake. It may be necessary, also, to 
work the ground at the sides of the rows as the plants are breaking through the surface. 
This should be done very carefully to avoid injury to the tender shoots. 

SETTING OUT PLANTS 

Plants grown in flats, hotbeds, or cold frames should be "hardened off," as has 
already been suggested, before they are to be planted out of doors. Another preliminary 
step, if the plants are too tall or succulent, is to trim away about one-half of the large 



KITCHEN GARDEN— CULTIVATION 489 

leaves. Several hours before transplanting the plants should be watered thoroughly, so 
that the soil will be moist enough to stick to the roots in balls of considerable bulk. After 
steiking out rows and marking planting positions, lift the plants out with a trowel, keeping 
as much soil as possible on the roots. Cut or tear the plants apart when their roots are 
intertwined. 

If the ground is moist, merely open a hole with a trowel or dibble, insert the earth- 
incased roots of a plant, draw soil up to the stalk and firm with knuckles and the balls of 
thumbs. If the soil is at all dry, pour about a pint of water into each hole before the 
plant is set. The surface about each plant should be raked carefully when all the plants 
are set. 

CULTIVATION 

The importance of cultivation has been referred to in the discussion of the prepara- 
tion of the seed bed. It is, however, after the seeds have sprouted or after the plants have 
been set in their permanent locations that cultivation becomes of major importance. The 
gardener should never permit the surface of the soil to become baked or even to form an 
appreciable crust. Constant stirring with heind tools or a wheel cultivator should be prac- 
ticed between the rows and about the plants. Such a stirring permits the air to penetrate 
the soil, where it facilitates chemical action cind bacterial activity, destroys weeds which 
otherwise would utilize large amounts of plant food, and, finally, conserves the moisture 
supply. The rake is perhaps the gardener's most valuable tool in cultivating. Tljis can 
be passed backward and forward over the ground until it is in an open, mellow condition. 
Where vegetables grow closely in the rows it often will be necessary to supplement the 
cultivation by hand weeding. Small implements are made for this purpose, and may be 
purchased cheaply. It is well also in some cases to pull up weeds by hand, especially where 
they grow closely about the stalks of the garden plants. 

STIRRING THE SOIL AFTER RAINS 

Just as the gardener should be careful in early spring not to dig the ground when 
the soil is too moist, so he should be careful later in the season not to cultivate too soon 
after rains. The stirring of very muddy soil "puddles" it into a compact, cement-like 
mass in which the plant food is securely locked. The garden will require attention, however, 
as soon as the excess moisture from a rain has soaked in or partially evaporated. Unless 
the ground is stirred at this time a crust will form almost inevitably. Such a crust, besides 
restricting the plants, prevents the access of air, and also facilitates the loss of moisture 
through evaporation. 

IRRIGATION 

When, during prolonged dry spells, the plants give evidence of suffering because of 
the lack of moisture, water must, if possible, be supplied artificially. Where a supply of 
piped water is at hand, perhaps the most usual method of irrigation is by sprinkling with 
a hose. If sprinkling is practiced, it should be done late in the afternoon. It is not sufficient 
merely to dampen the surface; a thorough wetting should be given. A more satisfactory 
and more economical method of irrigation, however, is to open small furrows between the 
rows of growing plants and to supply water in these ditches from a hose or pipe. Several 
hours after the water has soaked in, the dry earth should be drawn back into place. 

PROTECTING PLANTS FROM DISEASES AND PESTS 

Unfortunately, the gardener is not assured of success when his plants have started 
to grow thriftily. He must count almost inevitably upon the presence in his garden of 
plant diseases eund pests, which, if not combated, will interfere seriously with his yields or 
even destroy his plants. It is hard for some gardeners to realize the importance of making 



490 



THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Section XI— KITCHEN GARDEN 



early provision to combat these enemies of plant life. It cannot be too strongly emphasized, 
however, that such provision is of equal importance with other phases of gardening and 
that it should under no circumstances be neglected. The wise gardener does not wait for 
the appearance of insects and diseases, but takes steps to combat them by spraying the plants 
at reasonable intervals from early spring until his crops have been harvested, or by other 
protective measures. He thus insures himself against the likelihood of loss. 

The necessary implements and materials for protecting the home garden against 
insects and diseases should be assembled early in the season. These consist of a substantial 
hand sprayer and the necessary concentrated solutions, which, after dilution with water, are 
to be sprayed on the plants. 

The diseases which affect garden plants may be divided into two groups, parasitic 
and constitutional diseases. The pareisitic maladies, such as the blights, are caused by fungi 
or germs, and usually may be prevented or controlled by spraying with Bordeaux mixture. 
Little is known, however, of the so-called constitutional diseases, and little can be done to 
prevent their ravages. If some malady which does not yield to treatment with Bordeaux 
mixture manifests itself on isolated plants in the garden, it may be well to pull up these 
plants and burn them. 

The insects which attack garden plants may be divided into two groups — those which 
eat or chew the fruit or foliage, and those which suck the plant juices. Eating insects may 
be killed usually by spraying poisonous solutions or dusting powders on the plants which 
they attack. Arsenate of lead is the poison in most general use for this purpose. This sub- 
stance is poisonous to persons as well as to insects and must be used with care. It should 
not be applied to vegetables that are to be used soon. All vegetables should be washed 
carefully before they are eaten, regardless of wether they have been sprayed. 

Most of the garden plants may be guarded against disease and at the same time 
protected from attack by eating insects by spraying at intervals of two weeks with a com- 
bination of Bordeaux mixture and arsenate of lead. 

Other methods of protecting plants from the larger eating insects are to pick the 
pests by hand or knock them with a stick into a pan containing water on which a thin film 
of kerosene is floating. Insects collected by hand should be destroyed promptly. Young 
plants may be protected by setting over them ■wooden frames covered with mosquito net- 
ting, wire mesh, or cheesecloth. Cutworms may be kept from plants by setting tin or paper 
collars into the ground around the stalks. 

Sucking insects, such as plant lice, cannot be killed by poisoning the surface of 
the leaves and fruit, since they feed by puncturing the plants and extracting the internal 
juices. Poisons which will kill by contact or substances which envelop and smother the 
pests are, therefore, employed against the sucking insects. The principal remedies of this 
sort are nicotine solutions, fish-oil and other soap solutions, and kerosene emulsion.

•Methods of protecting gardens against grasshoppers are given in Farmers' Bulletin 691, "Grass- 
hoppers and Their Control on Sugar Beets and Truck Crops." 



KITCHE N GARDEN— PLANTING AND ROTATIONS 49j_ 

The preceding table lists the insects most likely to appear in the vegetable garden 
and furnishes information in regard to plants attacked and the treatment recommended. 

Transplanting should be done if possible in cloudy weather or late in the afternoon. 
If the weather is especially bright it may be necessary for a day or two to shade the plants 
with newspapers folded in inverted V shape and held in place with stones, earth, or other 
material. 

The quickest crop to mature is the radish. Lettuce, turnips, peas, beets, and beans 
usually require 6 to 9 weeks to mature; cabbage, potatoes, early peas, onion sets, and salad 
greens, 1 to 12 weeks; corn from 11 to 1 3 weeks, and potatoes from 15 to 16 weeks. 

SUCCESSIONS AND ROTATIONS 

Since a number of vegetables reach maturity early in the season, it is possible to 
utilize the space they occupied for successive plantings of the same vegetables or for rota- 
tion plantings of different plants. The earliest of all the vegetables to mature is the radish. 
The gardener generally can count on being able to utilize anew the space occupied by the 
first planting of these vegetables in from 5 to 7 weeks, depending on the rapidity with 
which they are consumed. In intensive gardening, however, it is not necessary to wait 
until all the radishes of the first planting have been removed before other plantings can be 
made. Enough of the roots can be removed at intervals to make places for setting lettuce, 
cabbage, cauliflo^ver, Brussels sprouts, or other plants, and the two crops — radishes and the 
interplanted crop — can continue growing side by side until the former is used. In a similar 
way, onion sets may be set out in rows that are to be occupied later by tomato plants, room 
being made for the latter by the removal of a few onions when the proper planting time for 
tomatoes arrives. Various combinations of this sort can be worked out between quick- 
maturing crops and the plants grown in frames or seed beds for later planting in the open. 

The gardener should not plant all of his radish, lettuce, or spinach seed at once, 
but should make several successive plantings at intervals of about two weeks. In this way 
the season for these vegetables will be lengthened greatly. Successive planting is possible 
also with beets, peas, beans, sweet com, and a number of other vegetables. The best of 
the successive crops of the quick-maturing vegetables must be crowded into the early part 
of the season, since most such plants do not thrive well when planted in hot weather. This 
is especially true of radishes and lettuce. In thhe case of lettuce this disadvantage can be 
overcome to a certain extent by artificial shading. 

In all sections but the extreme north it usually is possible to grow fall crops of cer- 
tain vegetables, notably carrots, beans, radishes, Irish potatoes, and turnips. In the southern 
part of the country an even larger number of vegetables may be grown in the fall. The 
seeds for these late crops are planted from July to September, depending on whether the 
garden is in the northern or southern States. 

In planting rotations of crops, whether the rotations be during the same or in suc- 
ceeding seasons, certain general principles should be kept in mind. In type and character 
of growth the succeeding plant should differ as widely as possible from the plant which it 
follows. This is both for the purpose of avoiding attacks by insects and diseases, and to 
insure that the second crop shall be properly nourished. A good plan is not to have root 
plants, such as beets and carrots, nor plants of the same family, such as cabbage and Brus- 
sels sprouts, or tomatoes and peppers, follow each other. It is well to divide the plants 
into root crops, fruiting crops, and foliage crops, and have members of the different groups 
alternate. 



492 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK-nSection XI— KITCHEN GARDEN 

For the convenience of gardeners who wish to plern to use their soil to best advan- 
tage by means of successive plantings and rotations, the following gnroupings of vegetables 
are made: 

1. Crop* Occupying the Ground All Season — Asparagus, rhubarb, beans (pole snap), beans (pole 
Lima), beets (late), carrots (late), parsnips, salsify, corn (late), cucumbers, melons, squash, pumpkins, 
tomatoes, eggplant, peppers, onions (from seeds), leeks, okra, potatoes (main crop), rutabagas. 

2. Successive Crops — Radish, spinach, lettuce, peas, beans (dwarf), parsley, turnips, kohl-rabi, 

3. Early Crops Which May Be Followed by Others* — Onion sets, beets (early), turnips (early), 
carrots (early), corn (early), cabbage (early). 

4. Late Crops Which May Follow Others t — Beets (late), spinach, peas (late), celery, cabbage 
(late), Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, kale, endive, flat turnips. 

The gardener should remember that many plant diseases and insects exist in the gar- 
den from year to year. At the end of the growing season, therefore, the garden should be 
carefully cleaned of rubbish, the stems of plants, leaves, etc. It is necessary to burn this 
debris promptly, as any disease spores or insects which may be present are then surely 
destroyed. 

CULTURAL SUGGESTIONS FOR THE COMMONER VEGETABLES 

RADISH 

Radishes are so hardy that they may be grown through the winter in cold frames 
in the latitude of Washington and farther South in the open ground. In the North they 
require hotbeds, but c£m be sown in the open ground as soon as the soil is moderately 
warm. They should be planted in drills 12 to 18 inches apart and thinned slightly as soon 
as the plants are up. On a quick, rich soil some of the earlier varieties Ccin be matured in 
from three to four weeks after planting. If the plants are allowed to remain long in the 
open ground, the roots lose their crispness and delicate flavor, and in order to secure a 
constant supply successive planting should be made every two weeks. One ounce of radish 
seed is sufficient to plant 1 00 feet of row. A large percentage of the seed germinates, amd 
if the sowing is done carefully later thinning may be unnecessary. The first radishes to 
appear may be pulled as soon as they are of sufficient size, and this will leave enough room 
for those that are a little later. The plant is not suited to hot weather, but should be 
planted in the early spring and late autumn. 

LETTUCE 

Lettuce does not withstand heat well and thrives best, therefore, in the early 
spring or late autumn. In order to have the leaves crisp and tender it is necessary to force 
the growth of the plant. The usual method of growing lettuce for home use is to sow the 
seeds broadcast in the bed emd to remove the leaves as rapidly as they become large 
enough for use. It is better, however, to sow the seeds in rows 14 to 16 inches apart, 
and when the plants come up to thin them to the desired distance. With the heading type 
this should be about 1 2 inches apart. This will result in the formation of rather compact 
heads and the entire plant may then be cut for use. For am early crop in the North, the 
plants should be started in a hotbed or cold frame and transplanted as soon as hard 
freezes are over. In many sections of the South the seeds are sown during the autumn 
and the plant allowed to remain in the ground over winter. Frequent shallow cultivation 
should be given the crop and, if crisp, tender letuce is desired during the summer months, 
some form of partial shading may be necessary. 

For head lettuce, Big Boston, Hanson, and California Cream Butter are good 
varieties. For loose-leaf lettuce, Grand Rapids or Black-seeded Simpson is recommended. 



* In addition to the vegetables listed in this group, all of those listed in Croup 2 may be followed 
by other crops. 

t Croup 2 crops also may follow early crops.

PEAS 

Garden peas are not injured easily by light frosts and may be plauited as soon as 
the soil can be put in order in the spring. By selecting a number of varieties it is possible 
to have a continuous supply of peas throughout a large portion of the growing season. In 
order to accomplish this, plantings should be made every ten days or 2 weeks until warm 
weather comes. The first plantings should be of small-growing, quick-maturing varieties, 
such as Alaska, First and Best, and Gradus. These kinds do not require supports. They 
should be followed by the large wrinkled type of peas, such as Champion of England, Tele- 
phone, and Prize Taker. These may be supported on brush, on strings attached to stakes 
driven in the ground, or on wire netting. 

Peas should be planted about 2 to 3 inches deep in rows 3 to 4 feet apart Some 
gardeners, however, follow the practice of planting in double rows 6 inches apart, with 
the ordinary space of 3 to 4 feet between these pairs of rows. With varieties requiring 
support this is a good practice, as the supports can be placed in the narrow space between 
the rows. / 'J 

ONIONS 

The onion will thrive under a wide range of climate and soil conditions, but a rich 
sandy loam containing plenty of humus is best suited to it. As the crop requires shallow 
cultivation and it may be necessary to resort to hand work in order to keep it free from 
weeds, it is very desirable that the land should be in such condition that it is easily worked. 
As a general rule, it is well to have the crop follow some other that has been kept under 
the hoe and free from weeds the previous seawon. 

In the North seed is sown as early in the spring as the soil can be brought to the 
proper condition. In the South, onion sets are frequently put out in the autumn and carried 
through the winter with the protection of a little hay or straw. There are three methods 
of propagating onions: The first by sowing the seed in rows where the crop is to grow; 
second, by sowing the seed in specially prepared beds and transplanting the seedlings to 
the open ground; and, third, by planting sets which have been kept through the winter. 
The first method is used by large commercial growers on account of the amount of labor 
involved in the others. 

On small areas, however, it may be preferable to plant sets. Under normal condi- 
tions these usually may be obtained at planting time for about 25 or 30 cents a quart. This 
should be enough for the average family. Onions planted from sets will ripen earlier than 
those from seed sown in the fields. 

When the transplanting method is used, the seed is sown in greenhouses, hotbeds, 
cold frames, or specially prepared beds at the rate of 3'/2 to 4 pounds for each acre to be 
planted. One-half ounce should furnish plants sufficient for the home garden. The seedlings 
are transplanted when they are somewhat smaller than a lead pencil and rather stocky. The 
root end of the seedling is pushed into the soil with one finger, and the soil is then firmed 
about the plant. 

The seed is sown thickly in drills about 12 to 14 inches apart. After the plants 
become established they are thinned to 2 or 3 inches apart. The maturity of the bulbs 
may be hastened by preventing the continued growth of the tops. This is sometimes ac- 
complished by rolling an empty barrel over the rows and breaking down the tops. After 
these are practically dead the onion bulbs may be pulled up by hand from the soil and 
spread in a dry, well-ventilated place to cure. Thereafter they may be stored in crates or 
bags for winter use. In the North the crop ripens and is harvested during the latter part 
of the summer and early autumn. In the Southern States, where the crop is grown during 
the winter, the harvesting and marketing period takes place during the spring months. 



494 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Section XI— KITCHEN GARDEN 



There are several kinds of onions that may remain in the soil over winter. The 
multiplier, or potato onion, for example, can be planted from sets in the autumn and will 
produce excellent green early onions. A large onion of this type contciins a number of dis- 
tinct hearts, and, if planted, will produce a number of small onions. On the other hand, 
a small onion contains but one heart and will produce a large onion. A few of the large 
ones may be planted each year to produce sets for the following year's planting. 

The shallot is a variety of small onion that is frequently planted in early spring 
for its small bulbs, or "cloves," which are used in the same manner as onions. The leaves 
are utilized for flavoring. Another onion-like plant is the chive, the small, round, hollow 
leaves of which are used for flavoring soups. These leaves may be cut freely, as they are 
soon replaced by others. 

THE PRINCIPAL ROOT CROPS 

Beets can be planted comparatively early in the season. It is not necessary to wait 
until the ground has become warm, if the danger of frost is past. The seed should be 
sown in drills 1 4 to 18 inches apart and covered to a depth of about I inch. As soon as 
the plants are well up they should be thinned to stand 3 to 4 inche* apart. From 2 to 3 
plantings should be made in order to have a continuous supply of young, tender beets. 

Parsnips, salsify, carrots, and turnips are all handled much like beets. Of the five, 
carrots can perhaps be left closer in the row than the others, about 2 or 3 inches apart. 
This plant, too, is less exacting in so far as fertility is concerned. Salsify, on the other hand, 
demands very fertile and finely cultivated soil. 

POTATOES* 

The potato plant thrives best in sandy or gravelly loam soils. It may be grown 
with a fair degree of success on any type of soil except loose sand and a heavy, sticky clay, 
provided the land is well drained and contains the necessary plant food. 

Successful potato production is dependent to a large extent on the thoroughness 
with which the land is prepared before planting the crop. Where a horse can be used, 
the land should be plowed from 8 to 1 inches deep, provided the surface soil is of a 
sufficient depth to permit it. It is never advisable to turn up more than I inch of raw sub- 
soil at any one plowing; so if previous plowings have not been over 6 inches, the maximum 
depth at which it should be plow^ed is 7 inches. 

Where hand labor is employed the same rule should govern as to depth. In spad- 
ing, especially on grass or waste land, turn the earth bottom side up. Whether the land 
is plowed or spaded, it should be thoroughly pulverized immediately afterwards. Where 
horse labor can be used, the land after plowing should be thoroughly disked first, then 
spring-toothed, and finally finished with a smoothing harrow. Where land must be pre- 
pared by hand, it is good practice to pulverize the soil as much as possible when spading 
it up, after w^hich it can be put in a fine condition of mellowness with a steel garden rake. 
The importance of thoroughly fining the soil cannot be overemphasized. 

Varieties Adapted to Different Localities 

Early Varieties — In the Northeastern United States and along the South Atlantic 
seaboard, the Irish Cobbler, Early Petoskey, or Early Standard, all of which are practically 
identical, may be expected to produce larger crops and be more generally satisfactory for 
an early crop than the others mentioned. Quick Lunch and New Queen would be regarded 
as second choices for this section. 

In the South Central and Southwestern States, the Triumph may be expected to 
give results equal to or even better than the Irish Cobbler. 

• Circular 87 of the Bureau of Entomology deals with the Colorado potato beetle, and Farmer*' 
Bulletin 557 deals with the potato tuber moth. 



KITCHEN GARDEN— CULTURED SUGGESTIONS 495 

In the Middle West, the Elarly Ohio should do well, while the Early Harvest and 
Early Rose may be regarded as second choices. 

Late Varieties — In the New England States, Long Island, and northern New York, 
the Green Mountain, Gold Coin, Delaware, and other late varieties of that class do best. 

In northern Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota, the late varieties named above 
do about as well as the Rural New Yorker No. 2, and are superior to it in table quality. 

In western New York, southern Michigan and Wisconsin, and Iowa, the Rural New 
Yorker No. 2, Sir Walter Raleigh, and Carman No. 3 are the best adapted varieties, and 
divide honors with the Green mountain in the northern portions of these States. 

Throughout Maryland, Virginia, the Carolinas, Tennessee, and Georgia, the variety 
known as McCormick is quite generally grown as a late variety. In a favorable season the 
Green Mountain can also be grown. 

When to Plant Potatoes 

The date of planting necessarily must be governed by climatic conditions. In at- 
tempting to produce as early a crop cis possible some risk must always be incurred of the 
plants being injured by late spring frosts. As a general proposition it is best to plant pota- 
toes as soon as there is little likelihood of killing frosts after the plants are up and the ground 
is in condition to work. 

The following dates of planting for various cities should be regarded only as the 
approximate time at which early potatoes might safely be planted: 

March 15 to 25: Washington, Baltimore, Philadelphia, Cincinnati, Louisville, St. 
Louis. 

March 25 to April 5: New York, Indianapolis, Detroit, Chicago. 

April 5 to 15: Boston, Albany, Rochester, etc. 

In the northern cities, late varieties should be planted from three to four weeks 
later. 

Planting Practices 

The usual method of preparing potatoes for planting is to cut them into rather 
large pieces, containing several eyes. When seed potatoes are unusually expensive, however, 
it may be well to cut cone-shaped segments of meat around each eye and to use the remain- 
ing portion of the tubers for food. Under this plan it is not necessary to prepare the seed 
all at one time. From day to day the cones for seeding can be cut from the potatoes as 
they are being prepared for the table. The cuttings then should be spread out on a piece 
of paper in a moderately cool room (about 50 degrees F. ) and allowed to remain there 
until they have cured ; that is, until the cut surface has become dry. A day or two should 
suffice for this, and potatoes then should be put in a shallow box or tray and placed where 
it is still cooler. Any storage condition that will insure them against frost on the one hand 
tnd undue shriveling on the other should prove satisfactory. 

These seeds can be started indoors, provided it is possible to secure suitable soil 
and boxes. In such cases it may be desirable to plant the eye cuttings at once, and allow 
them to start into growth indoors with the idea of transplanting them into the open ground 
when danger of frost is past and the ground is dry enough to be cultivated. 

The smaller the size of the set, or seed piece, used the more thorough must be the 
preparation of the soil. The more finely the soil is pulverized and the more uniform the 
moisture conditions which can be preserved in the soil, the better is the chance for the small 
seed piece to establish itself. A small set in rough, lumpy, or dried-out soil has little 
chance to live. 

Generally speaking, the smaller the size of the set the closer it should be planted 
in the row if maximum yields are to be secured. Such sets may be expected to give the 



496 



THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Section XI— KITCHEN GARDEN 



best yields if not spaced more than 10 to 12 inches apart in the row. Plant the small eye 
cuttings from 1 J/2 to 3 inches deep, depending upon the character of the soil — the lighter 
the soil the greater the depth of planting. Larger sets may be pleinted 4 inches deep. 

Spacing 

If an early variety is planted, and the work is to be done by hand, the rows may 
be spaced as close as 26 inches, whereas, if cultivation is to be done vrith a horse, 30 to 34 
inches usually is allowed. In order to give the gardener some idea of the number of sets 
required to plant a plot of g^round 50 by 100 feet at different spacings, the following table 
is submitted:

If a late variety is planted, the spacing should be greater, say, 34 to 36 inches 
between the rows and 12 to 14 inches between the plants in the row. The closeness of 
planting should be determined, first, by the variety, and, second, by the amount of available 
plant food and moisture in the soil or that can be applied to it. 

CORN 

Corn to be at its best should be eaten within a few hours after it is picked, for its 
sugar content disappears very rapidly after it is removed from the garden. For this reason 
and because of its very general popularity it is an excellent vegetable to grow in the home 
garden. It should be planted on rich land and cultivated in the same manner as field com. 
Beginning as soon as the soil is warm, successive plantings may be made every two or three 
weeks until late summer. Another method of prolonging the supply is to plant early, 
medium, and late varieties. The seed should be planted about 2 inches deep, in drills 3 
feet apart, and thinned to a single stalk every 1 to 14 inches. 

The following varieties are recommended: For early corn. Golden Bantam and 
Adams Early, and for medium and late varieties. Black Mexican or Crosby's Early, Coun- 
try Gentleman, and Stowell's Evergreen. The last-named variety has the largest ears and 
is the most productive. 

Corn should be planted on rich land. The cultivation should be frequent and 
thorough and all weeds should be kept down and suckers removed from around the base 
of the plant. 

TOMATOES 

Tomato plants should be started in the house or in a hotbed and should be trans- 
planted once or twice in order that strong and vigorous plants may be secured by the 
time all danger from frost is past. Pot-grown plants are especially desirable, as they may 
be brought to the blooming period by the time it is warm enough to plant them with 
safety in the garden. If the plants are not to be trained, but are to be allowed to lie on 
the ground, they should be set about 4 feet apart each way. If trimmed and tied to stakes 
they may be planted in rows 3 feet apart and 1 8 inches apart in the row. The home 
gardener will find the latter method preferable. 



KITCHEN GARDEN— CULTURED SUGGESTIONS 497 

In common with all plants grown in a house, hotbed, or cold fraime, tomatoes 
require to be hardened off before they are planted in the garden. By this process the plzmts 
are gradually acclimated to the effects of the sun and wind, so that they will stand trans- 
planting to the open ground. Hardening off usually is accompanied by ventilating freely 
and by reducing the amount of water applied to the plant bed. The bed, however, should 
not become so dry that the plants will wilt or become seriously checked in their growth. 
After a few days it will be possible to leave the plants uncovered during the entire day and 
on mild nights. 

EGGPLANTS AND PEPPERS 

Eggplants and peppers are started and handled in the same way as the tomato. 
The soil best adapted for their production is a fine, rich, sandy loamn, well drained. The 
plants should be set in rows 3 feet apart and 2 feet apart in the row. Free cultivation is 
desirable, and the plants should be kept growing rapidly. A dozen good healthy plants 
each of eggplant and pepper should supply enough fruits for the average sized family 
throughout the season. Both of these vegetables are heat-loving and should not be set 
in the open until the ground has become warm. 



BEANS 

Beems are more susceptible to cold that peas and should not be planted until dein- 
ger of frost is past and the ground begins to warm up. They are, however, among the 
most desirable vegetables that the home gardener can raise. There are many different kinds 
and varieties of beans, but for garden purposes they may be divided into two classes — 
string and Lima. Both classes are grown in practically all parts of the United States where 
the frost-free period is greater than three months and adapt themselves to a wide diversity 
of soils and climate. They grow rapidly, and, therefore, leave the area in which they 
have been planted free for another crop. To secure a continuous supply, it is desirable 
to make plantings at intervals of 1 days or 2 weeks from the time that the ground is 
reasonably warm until hot weather sets in. 

Both string and Lima beans are subdivided into pole and bush types. Pole Lima 
beans should be planted with from 8 to 1 seeds in the hill, and after the plants become 
established should be thinned to 3 or 4. The hills should be 4 or 5 feet apart. Bush Lima 
beans are planted 5 or 6 inches apart in rows 30 to 36 inches apart. Bush beans of the 
string type may be planted somewhat closer — the plants standing 3 or 4 inches apart in 
rows from 20 to 24 inches apart if hand cultivation only is to be employed. 

Beans of any kind should not be planted any deeper than is necessary to secure 
good germination. This should never be over 2 inches and on heavy soil it should not be 
more than 1 '/^ to 1 ^ inches. 

Beans are useful in the home garden, since they thrive on practically any type of 
soil. The pole varieties are especially convenient, since they can be planted along the edges 
of the yard and permitted to climb on the fences. Some of the pole beans, both snap and 
Lima, will continue to bear until frost. If the pole beans are planted in the hills in the 
garden proper, it will be necessary to sink a pole at each hill or to provide some other 
form of support. Extra long poles may be used and the tops of three or four different 
hills fastened together tent fashion. If it is desired to keep the garden free from poles, 
substantial posts may be set at each end of the row and a wire or strong cord stretched 
between their tops. Cords may then be extended from small stakes in each hill to the 
wire. 



498 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Section XI— KITCHEN GARDEN 

CUCUMBERS, SQUASHES, AND MELONS 

Cucumbers, squashes,* and melons all belong to the melon family and demand much 
the same treatment. All are heat-loving and should not be planted in the open until the 
ground has become warm. It is easily possible, however, to give the plants an early start 
in the house and so gain several weeks in earliness of maturity. One way is to plant seven 
or eight seeds in berry boxes filled with soil. Each box of growing plants should have its 
bottom removed at planting time and should then be sunk in the garden to constitute a 
hill of plants. 

Instead of growing the plants in boxes of ordinary soil they may be grown on sods 
in a suitable receptacle. Cut sods 6 inches square from spots which the growth of grass 
shows to be rich. Turn these grass side down and press the seeds in among the roots and 
soil. Cover with about an inch and a half of good soil and keep moist and warm. At 
planting time the sods may be lifted and placed in hills, which first should have manure 
worked into them. 

These plants are rank growers and occupy much space. In very small gardens it 
may be well, therefore, to omit them. If squashes are grown, it may be well to plant only 
bunch varieties. Space may be conserved by growing a few cucumber vines near the edge 
of the garden and training them on a fence. This is possible, too, of course, with some 
melons and pumpkins, but supports will be necessary for the fruits. If the plants of this 
group are grown in the main garden, they must be spaced from 6 to 1 2 feet apart each 
way. 

CABBAGE, CAULIFLOWER, AND BRUSSELS SPROUTS 

Cabbage and the other two members of the cabbage family mentioned here require 
much the same treatment. f All three are grown in hotbeds, frames, or flats for the early 
crop and are set out when all danger of frost is past. Of the three, Brussels sprouts is 
the hardiest. Cabbage is fairly hardy, but cauliflower is somewhat tender. All require 
rather moist soil andj plenty of plant food. Fertilizer may be conserved by placing it under 
each "hill" before the plants are set. The settings should be made 18 to 24 inches apart 
in rows spaced about 24 inches. 

MISCELLANEOUS SALAD VEGETABLES 

Besides lettuce there are a number of vegetables for use as salads or cooked greens 
that may be grown easily in the home garden. Of the salad plants, corn salad, garden 
cress, and endive are perhaps best known. The first two may be planted early. Endive, 
however, is planted in June and July. All are grown in drills about 14 inches apart and 
are thinned to proper distances as they grow. 

Spinach and mustard are useful greens for cooking. Spinach may be grown either 
in the spring or in the fall. It is grown in drills, the use of the larger plants first auto- 
matically taking care of thinning. 

Mustard greens may be produced on almost any good soil. The basal leaves are 
used for greens and are cooked like spinach. The plants require but a short time to reach 
the proper stage for use and frequent sowings should be made. The seeds are sowed 
thickly in drills as early as possible in spring or for late use in September or October. 
Ostrich Plume is a reliable variety. 

For use both as a salad plant and for cooked greens Swiss chard, a beet which has 
been developed for foliage, should be more extensively grown. One of the good points 
about this vegetable is that crop after crop of leaves may be cut without injuring the plant. 
Chard is planted like beets in drills 12 to 14 inches apart and thinned to 4 to 6 inches. 

* An insect that attacks squashes and other crops of this class is described in Farmers' Bulletin 668, 
"The Squash-vine Borer.** 

t Accounts of two insects that attack cabbage are given in Farmers* Bulletin 766, "The Common 
Cabbage Worm,** and Circular 103 of the Bureau of Entomology, "The Harlequin Cabbage Bug.** 



KITCHEN GARDEN— CULTURED SUGGESTIONS 499 

PERMANENT VEGETABLES 

A number of vegetables, once established, will furnish a supply of their products 
year after year. Asparagus, rhubarb, and a number of garnishing and flavoring herbs are 
the best-known members of this group. Because they permanently occupy the space in which 
they grow, such plants should be in beds separated from the cultivated vegetables. 

For the asparagus bed a well drained, early location should be chosen. Prepare 
the bed by digging a trench 18 inches wide and 20 inches deep. Fill this one-third full 
with well-rotted manure and tramp it down well. Half fill the remaining space with good 
soil, and on this set the root clumps of asparagus, 1 foot apart. Such roots, one, two, or 
three years old, may be purchased from seedsmen or nurseries. Cover the roots by filling 
the trench to the surface of the ground with good soil. The stalks should not be cut until 
a year after planting, and then but lightly. Full harvests may be taken after this. From a 
dozen to two dozen roots should be enough for the average family. ■ 

Rhubarb is also grown from root clumps. A row of six or eight plants, 4 feet 
apart, should furnish stalks enough for the average family. Each hill should be well pre- 
pared with manure and good soil. Set the crowns about 4 inches underground. Stalks 
should not be cut until a year after planting. 

Parsley seeds are sown in a drill in spring. The plants will die down in the fall 
and put out fresh foliage the next spring. The plant is a biennial and must be replanted at 
two-year intervals. 

Sage is a useful perennial herb which can be grown easily in the home garden. 
One or two bushes will furnish an abundance of leaves. These, when full grown, should 
be thoroughly dried and stored in cans or jars. 

ANNUAL PLANTS USED FOR SEASONING 

Chives are small onionlike plants having flat, hollow leaves. These are cut and used 
for flavoring soups, sauces, etc. The plants are propagated by bulbs. A patch of the 
plants a foot or so square should be enough for the home garden. 

Okra, or gumbo, produces pods which are used to season and thicken soups. The 
seeds of okra should be sown in the open after the ground has become quite warm, or the 
plants may be started in berry boxes in the hotbed or in the house and transplanted in the 
garden after all danger of frost has passed. The rows should be 4 feet apart for the dwarf 
sorts and 5 feet apart for the tall kinds, with the plants 2 feet apart in the row.* If the 
pods are removed before they are allowed to ripen, the plants will continue to produce 
them until killed by frost. 

Cabbage, carrots, turnips, and rutabagas, in addition to their use as early crops, 
may be planted early in summer and the products which mature in autumn may then be 
held for winter use. 

VEGETABLES FOR WINTER USE 

For a late crop of cabbage it is customary to plant the seeds in a bed in the open 
ground in May or June and trainsplant them to the garden in July. For cabbage of this 
character the soil should be heavier and more retentive of moisture than for early cabbage, 
which requires a rich, warm soil in order to reach maturity quickly. For the late variety 
it is not desirable to have too rich a soil, as the heads are liable to burst. Cabbages should 
be set in rows 30 to 36 inches apart, and plants standing 14 to 18 inches apart in the row. 
To store cabbage for the winter the heads should be buried in pits or placed in cel- 
lars. One method is to dig a trench about 1 8 inches deep and 3 feet wide and set the 
cabbage upright with the heads close together and the roots embedded in the soil. When 
cold weather comes the heads are covered lightly with straw and 3 or 4 inches of earth 

* Detailed information on this plant is contained in Farmers' Bulletin 232, "Okra: Its Culture and 
Uses." 



500 THE HOME-KEEPING BOOK— Section XI— KITCHEN GARDEN 

put in. Slight freezing does not injure cabbage, but it should not be subjected to repeated 
freezing and thawing. 

Parsnips will occupy the ground from early spring until fall. The seeds should be 
sown aa early as convenient in the spring in rows 1 8 inches to 3 feet apart. The plaints 
should later be thinned to stand 3 inches apart in the row. A rich soil with frequent cul- 
tivation is necessary for success with this crop. TTie roots are dug late in the fall and stored 
in cellars or pits, much as cabbage is, or else are allowed to remain where they Eire grown 
and are dug as required for use. All roots not dug during the winter, however, should be 
removed from the garden, as they vnll produce seed the second season and become of a 
weedy nature. When the parsnip has been allowed to run wild in this way the root is con- 
sidered to be poisonous. 

Carrots may be sown early, used during the late summer, and the surplus stored. 
If desired, a later crop may be sown after the removal of an early vegetable, especially for 
winter use. Carrots are grovm in practically the same way as parsnips, but are not thinned 
so much and are allowed to grow almost as thickly as planted. They are dug in the autumn 
and stored in the same manner as parsnips or turnips. 

Turnips require a rich soil and may be grown either as an early or late crop. For 
a late crop it is customary to sow the seeds broadcast on land from which some early crop 
has been removed. In the North this is generally done during July and August, but the 
usual time is later in the South. The seed also may be sown in drills I 2 to 18 inches apart 
aa for the early crop. After the plants appear they are thinned to about 3 inches. 

The rutabaga is similar to the turnip and is grown in much the same way. It re- 
quires more space, however, and a longer period for its growth. It is used to a considerable 
extent for stock feed eind has the adveintage of being quite hardy. 

FRUITS IN THE SMALL GARDEN— BERRIES 

If there is sufficient space in the home garden, it may be desirable to have it supply 
fruits as well as vegetables. The small fruits, such as strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, 
currants, and gooseberries, may be produced with little trouble. A few dozen strawberry 
plants, and even few of the other plants mentioned, should be sufficient for a start. The 
plantings can be increased from year to year by resetting the young plants which spring 
up from runners and roots. All the small fruit plants mentioned may be set out in spring. 
Since most of these plants will occupy the same space year after year, they should be 
segregated from the part of the garden devoted to annual vegetables. 

Grapes may, in many instances, be grown in the home garden more easily than the 
small bush fruits, since they may be planted near fences and permitted to run upon them. 
Grape plants also may be set put in spring before the sap rises. Fairly large holes should 
be dug, and these filled 'with rich soil mixed with wood ashes. 

TREE FRUITS 

Tree fruits probably cannot be grown in most small home gardens because of the 
relatively large areas of soil their roots occupy. The use of dwarf trees, however, makes 
possible the growing of a few fruit trees in the larger yards and garden inclosures. Though 
strawberries, cucumbers, and a few other vegetables may be grown near the trees while 
the latter are small, most vegetables must be grown in the open, where they will receive 
abundant sunlight. If fruit trees are grown in connection with gardening operations, there- 
fore, they should, where possible, be well removed from the main garden plot. 

Apple, peach, cherry, pear, plum, apricot, and quince trees may be purchased on 
dwarfing stocks. All may be set out in the spring before growth starts. The trees should 
be set in holes several feet square in which rich soil has been placed. They should be set 
an inch or so lower than in the nursery.

ALPHABETICAL INDEX 
Where to find the information contained in this volume. 

How to Use the Index — Note the following: 

On subjects of a general nature, particularly where treatment is in a writ- 
ten discussion or study rather than in brief paragraphs or specific recipes, always 
look on pages preceding and following, as well as on the page given. Other mat- 
ter bearing on the subject will thus be found, often matter on the specific subject 
and almost invariably on such closely related subject-matter as to be of material 
relation to the subject sought. 

But do not get the "Index Habit" — do not turn to the Index always before 
you do anything else. The Index is intended as a guide where you want every- 
thing bearing on a given subject. It is not necessary w^here you want a simple 
recipe only, or the solution to some simple problem. For illustration, if you are 
on the subject of Breads : You will probably find the Bread Recipe you want under 
the Classification, Breads, in Part 2, Cooking and Recipes, of Section IV, The 
Kitchen and Cookery. If you want to look up War Breads using no wheat or wheat 
substitutions, you wiH look for them in the Food Administration Supplement. If 
you want to look up every pertinent reference made to Breads, Breads as a Carbo- 
hydrate Food, Breads in Diet Value, Bread Substitute Materials, etc., etc., you will 
consult the Index on Breads, as well as on Flour, on Substitutes, Children's Foods, 
Invalids' Diets, on Corn Meal, and under such other related headings as are sug- 
gested to you by the purposes for v^hich you w^ant the information; and you will 
thus get together a complete scientific study on every angle of the Bread question. 

Familiarize yourself in a general way with the Book itself, and you will find 
yourself able to turn naturally, for all usual purposes, at once to the Section and 
page you want, without any poring over the Index. The Book is almost self-indexed 
in the way of its arrangement; with a very little familiarity it at least becomes so 
for all practical ends. 

Page Numbers: 

i, ii, iii, etc., to xvi — Preliminary Pages in fore part 
of Book. 

S-1, S-2, etc., to S-80 — Supplement Section. 

1, 2, 3, etc., to 502, Main Body of the Book. 

xvii, etc. — Index Pages at back of Book. 

Use the Supplement — It contains the latest Food Administration Special 
War Economy Recommendations and Recipes for Savings — Save smd Serve the 
Cause of Freedom. * 

Don't Elxpect to Find every sort of individual recipe in the Index. Look for 
it under its proper classification in the Book itself. We do not encumber the 
Index with such items as Waldorf Salad or Peach Pie, which one will naturally 
look for under Salad or Pie (Pastry). Only such recipes are indexed as to the 
classification of which one might be uncertain.
