PREFACE. 



If yon know better precepts than these, candidly tell me ; 
if not, foUow them as I do. — ^Hobacb. 



Amid the numerous books, to which the names of well- 
known professors of the culinary art are attached, it may 
appear in some degree presumptuous in one unknown to 
present to the Public her ^ Cre-fydd's Family Fare.' 

The Authoress would not have been thus daring had 
she not ascertained by her own experience, as well as that 
of many friends, that whatever the other merits of previous 
works on the subjects of cookery and household manage- 
ment, they are not practically available for the moderate 
and economical, yet reasonably luxurious housekeeper, or 
for those who are young or who are inexperienced in 
those matters. In those works there is no lack of receipts, 
maxims, and * directions to the cook ; ' but in general, when 
tested by a moderate cook, or directed by an inexperienced 
person, failure and disappointment are the result. 

Let any young housewife in moderate circumstances (and 
we cannot all afford to invoke the shade of Tide, or have 
FrancatelU at our elbow) answer whether, when she has put 
the newly-purchased cookery-book into the hands of her 
cook, she has not been ultimately disappointed. Not from 
excessive fastidiousness on her part, or from the want of 
goodwill in the cook, but because, in the majority of in- 



X PREFACE. 

stances^ the receipts and directions are only suited to those 
cooks who are well informed, and have had considerable 
practice (see note, p. xi.). They are often the result of theo- 
retical ingenuity, or the productions of those who know, 
but who cannot impart their knowledge to the uninformed. 
Theory and practice must be combined ; and that com- 
bination put forth in such language, that while the lady 
will not object to read, the cook will be able to understand. 
The Authoress of the present work has, from various 
motives, sought opportunities, and from peculiar circum- 
stances found them, of acqiuring the receipts it contains. 
They are not all new to the Public, though many of 
them are, but they have all this recommendation — 
that they have been tested, and served on the table 
of the Authoress, under her direct supervision. Those 
dishes have passed the ordeal of &stidious and almost 
morbidly critical palates, and have come forth with ap- 
provaL The materials suggested are reasonably econo- 
mical, the quantities exact, and the directions plain. 
The words * reasonably economical' are used advisedly, 
as it would be insulting to the understanding of sensible 
persons to state that inferior materials can be formed into 
superior dishes. In addition to the receipts on cookery, 
the Authoress has introduced a variety of other receipts 
and suggestions for the management of a house and ser- 
vants. With regard to servants, it may be observed that 
many of them would be much better for the gentle but 
firm directions of a kind mistress. Experienced and skillfril 
servants need no direction ; but such are not always to be 
found ; and when found, the rate of wages required by them 
would not be suitable to persons with a moderate income. 
A mistress, under such circumstances, if she would have 



PREFACE. xi 

a comfortable establisliinent, must be able, in some degree, 
to instruct her servants ; without this, it is impossible that 
they, who have but little experience, can know the wants 
incident to a respectable family. 

The necessity of doing what she advises, has been forced 
on the Authoress during a long Ufe of much experience. 

In order to moderate, in some degree, the difficulty of 
managing a household, these suggestions are made. If 
the Authoress has aided the young housewife, and smoothed 
the way in the difficulties of housekeeping, and in that 
essential to health and comfort, good cooking, her object 
has been attained. 

It will be observed that the quantity of every ingredient 
used is carefully given, as well as the exact time required 
in cooking. Each receipt is perfect in itself, for it is found 
that reference to other receipts is, to the inexperienced, 
extremely perplexing. French terms are avoided. 

It is right to add that the whole of the receipts have 
been successfully used, with the simple aid of an ordinary 
range, and the vsual appliances found in the kitchen of a 
small establishment. 



Note. 

The following extracts from modem and much-praised 
cookery-books, in our own language, as well as French, 
Italian, and Grennan, will fully justify the remark in the 
text: — 

'LiLMB CUTLETS i LA PRINCESSE. 

* Trim and jfry the cutlets^ the usual manner ; and when be- 
come partially cold, dip each cutlet up to the bone in some stiffly- 
reduoed Allemande sauce strongly flavoured with mushrooms; 



XU PREFACE. 

each cutlet as it is dipped to be afterwards placed flat on a baking- 
sheet upon rough ice, to set the same quite firm on the cutlets ; 
they are then to be egged, crumbed, fried in hot lard, and, being 
dished up, are to be garnished with a pur^e of green asparagus, 
or asparagus peas, and some supreme or any other white sauce 
poured round the base.' — Francatelli's Cooh's Guide, 

* SHOULDERS OF VEAL STUFFED. 

' Take the joint and lay it with the skin side downwards; with a 
sharp thin knife carefully detach the meat from the bladebone, 
then hold the shoulder edgewise, and detach the meat from the 
other side of the bone, being careful not to make a hole in the 
skin ; then cut the bone from the knuckle and take it out. You 
may at first be rather awkward about it, but after once or twice 
trying it will become easy ; you may also take out the other 
bone, but I prefer it in, as it keeps the shape better ; then lard the 
lean part like the neck (in No. 320) ; mix some salt and a little 
mixed spice together, with which rub the meat from whence the 
bone has been cut, stuff with veal stuffing, or sausage-meat, or 
suet pudding; braise, garnish, and serve (as No. 303). This 
being the toughest part of the veal, it should be tried before 
taking up, to see if it is properly done, by thrusting a larding 
needle in it. If it goes in easily, it is done. This joint is excellent 
cold, and should be carved in thin slices crosswise.' — Soyer's 
Modem Housewife, 

^ POULETS. 

' Set the fowls for one hour in cold water, then they are to be 
plain boiled. For the sauce, ubc a pint and a half of b^chamelle 
and a teaspoonful of white sauce ; reduce it to a pint ; put into 
it equal quantities^ of mushrooms and truffles, and pieces of 
quenelle the size of a nut; leave it in the bain-marie to keep warm, 
and remain till wanted. Serve the sauce in a tureen, to be put 
on each plate by the carver.' — The Lady's Guide, 

^HARICOT MUTTON. 

' This dish is nothing more than mutton chops browned in the 
fiying-pan, and then stewed in just enough water to cover them, 
with pieces of onion, carrot and turnip (also browned), cut into 



PBEFACE. XUl 

dice, and placed upon them, flavoured with mushroom or walnut 
catsup, tomato or Beading sauce, and served with a slice or 
two of pickled gherkin.' — The Dinner Question, 

^BEEF PALATES. 

* Simmer them in water several hours, till they will peel ; then 
cut the palates into slices, or leave them whole, as you choose, 
and stew them in a rich gravy till as tender as possible. Before 
you serve, season them with cayenne, salt, and ketchup. If the 
gravy was drawn clear, add also some butter and flour. If to be 
servied white, boil them in milk, and stew them in a Mcassee 
sauce, adding cream, butter, flour, and mushroom-powder, and 
a little poimded mace.' — Mrs. Bundell's Domestic Cookery, 

* TETB DE VEAU EN TOKTUE. 

' Apr^s avoir fait blanchir et bouillir la t^te de veau, vous la 
d^sossez enti^rement et la coupez en morceaux. Yous dentelez 
ToreiUe pour mettre en haut et couronner votre plat, et vous la 
&ites cuire comme pour manger au naturel, avec n^nmoins un 
peu de vin blanc. Pendant qu'elle cuit, vous disposez votre 
ragoiit. Vous feites un roux que vous mouillez de bouillon. 
Vous y ajoutez des crates de coq, rognons, champignons, quenelles, 
ris de veau, foies de volailles, bouquet de persil, beurre, sel, 
piment, vin de Madere, avec jaunes d'oeufe durcis, la langue et la 
cervelle. Les morceaux de la t^te etant bien ^goutt^s, vous les 
dressez en pyramide, vous versez votre sauce et vos garnitures 
dessus, et vous gamissez votre plat d'^crevisse et de croiitons 
Mts.' — La Bonne et Parfaite Cuisiniere. 

^INSALATA DI VITELLO CON SALSA TAKTAKA.

REMARKS ON FAMILY FARE. 



The bills of &mily fare are made out for two persons, as it is 
found to be more difficult to provide for few than many. They 
are, however, so arranged, that by a proportionate addition of 
quantity, they will serve for four or six persons ; and those who 
may consider them too much for two, will have a choice of dishes 
to select from. If the bills of fare be followed in succession, it 
will be seen that everything is disposed of, as nearly as can be, 
without being acquainted with the appetites and habits of the 
consumers. The puddings may be found too large, but they can 
easily be reduced, as the exact quantities are given in each 
receipt. The price of fish varies considerably, consequently it 
should be chosen according to the market of the day. The fish 
for femily fere should not exceed the prices in the subjoined list. 
Those prices, and all others, as well as the calculation of house- 
keeping expenses {see Hints to Mistresses), will only be a guide 
to residents in London or the suburbs, and even there they will 
vary in different districts.

REMARKS AND DIRECTIONS 



TO SE BEMEMBERED. 



In writing receipts, it is impossible to give in each every detail ; 
it must therefore be understood that * a spoonful,' whether table, 
dessert, tea, or saltspoon, be used, means a spoon of the ordinary 
size for kitchen use, filled, but not piled. The same observation 
applies to cups and glasses. When carrots, turnips, celery, 
onions, mushrooms, potatoes, lemons, &c., are ordered without 
specification, the medium size must be understood ; * pepper,' 
either kind; * mustard,' made or wn-made; *dry flour,' dried, but 
not baked ; * dried crumbs,' bread prepared as directed ; * water,' 
cold. If these remarks be remembered, no difliculty can arise, 
as in all cases where detail is necessary, it is given in the 
receipt. 

Kitchen Utensils, — ^Extreme cleanliness is indispensable to good 
cooking. Pots, stewpans, saucepans, fiyingpans, and every other 
utensil, must be kept bright inside. Each time they are used, 
they should be well washed with hot water, scoured with silver 
sand and a wisp of hay (which should always be at hand), rinsed 
and dried before putting them away. Soda should not be used, 
as it soon destroys the tinning of the vessels. Pudding-cloths, jelly- 
bags, and sieves should be washed several times in very hot 
water, without soap or soda, and dried in the open air. Paste- 
slabs, rolling-pin, moulds, earthen pans, and the lids, tables, &c., 
must be kept scrupulously clean. 

The Oven, — The oven requires attention both in cleansing and 
heating, or it will not work satisfactorily. It should be swept 
and well rubbed with a wet cloth every morning. More or less 
fire must be applied to obtain the degree of heat required, which 
may be ascertained by putting in a piece of stale crumb of bT«wi^ 



Clvi BEMABKS AND DIRECTIONS TO BE REMEMBERED. 

and shutting the door for ten minutes. If the heat be great, it 
will be baked brown ; if moderate, slightly browned ; and if 
gentle, yellow. 

Fire for Roasting. — The ashes should be well cleared out 
before making up the fire for roasting. Poultry, game, or joints 
imder twelve pounds weight, require a fire nineteen inches wide 
and fifteen inches high. It should be burnt through, and the 
screen and dripping-pan placed before it, to get hot, before the 
joint is put down to roast. 

Roasting. — The joint should be hung close to the fire (/our 
inches from the bars) for the first quarter of an hour, unless 
Dthen^dse directed in the receipts, and then drawn to a distance 
{twelve inches from the bars) till done. This process sets the 
juice in the meat, and much improves the flavour. 

Boiling, — Great care is required in boiling. Except where 
otherwise directed, the joint should be put into suflicient cold 
water to cover it, boiled up quickly^ then simmered till done ; that 
is to say, the water must be kept at boiling heat, but must not be 
permitted to bubble, or to wave perceptibly. This process causes 
the meat to swell, renders it tender and juicy ; while boiling will 
cause the meat to shrink from the bone, and render it hard and 
dry. 

Braising, — This word means to cook meat, poultry, &c. by 
the appliance of very gentle heat, and with little or no liquid. 
The process is much longer than ordinary stewing, or than boiling, 
consequently simmering must be attended to. 

Steaming, — An ordinary steamer may be used in all cases 
where steaming is ordered ; the saucepan under it must be full 
of water, and boil fast all the time ; or for puddings a pint pie- 
dish may be turned upside down in a saucepan with three pints 
of boiling water in it, and the pudding placed upon that. 

Plates and Dishes should be washed in plenty of hot water 
(without soda), rinsed in cold water, then drained till dry. 
When sent to table, they should be hot, but not so much so as 
to be disagreeable. The bottom of the dishes should be care- 
fully wiped. 

Serving, — Whether about to serve immediately, or if the dinner 
be imavoidably delayed, everything should be taken up at the 



BEMARES AND DIRECTIONS TO BE BEMEMBEBED. clvii 

moment it is done. Boiled fish, poultry, or joints should be 
covered -with a hot cloth, and kept over the steam, but not over 
the fire. Three minutes before sending to table put them into 
the water and boil up. Lay roast poultry or joints in the 
dripping-pan, and protect them irom the fire by a dish ; put them 
into a hot oven, or rehang before the fire, for five or ten minutes 
before serving. Fish may be re-fi'ied. Potatoes may be mashed and 
browned, and other vegetables may be thrown into fast-boiling 
water for three or four minutes ; thus a dinner need never be 
spoiled by a little delay. The dinner should be sent to table 
covered by hot covers, which should be scrupulously clean and 
highly polished inside and out. Pastry and puddings are better 
not covered, as the steam makes them heavy and spoils their 
appearance. 

Second Dressing, — The various dishes arranged from cold fish, 
meat, poultry and game come under this nomination. 

Clearing Soup. — ^Fast boiling, imcovered, is the best way of 
clearing soup, but it sometimes fails ; in this case, throw in the 
whites of three or four fresh eggs, and whisk it briskly for ten 
minutes while boiling fiist ; then take it off the fire, let it settle for 
ten minutes. Strain carefully. 

Sieves and Jelly hags. — Hair or tammy sieves and jelly bags 
must be put into very hot water for five minutes before using. 
The bags must be wnmg out as hot as possible ; attending to 
this will render the straining process more effectual. 

Moulds, — Moulds must be dipped into cold water before 
putting either jelly or cream into them ; and when about to turn 
out the contents, they must be quickly dipped into hot water and 
wiped dry. 

Baked Flour, — Put one pound of fine flour into a soup plate, 
and bake in a cool oven till it is quite dry, but not coloured ; when 
cold, pound it and put it into a glass jar ; tie it over with paper, 
and keep for use, as directed in the receipts. Bake another 
pound in a quick oven till of a pale brown colour. When cold, 
pound it ; put it into a jar, and use when directed. Baked flour 
is an essential to good cooking, and the cook should never be 
without it. 

Prepared Crumbs, — ^Put some bread on a sheet of paper, place 



Clviii BEMABKS Al^D DIKECTIONS TO BE BEMEMBEBED. 

it in a cool oven, and let it remain till perfectly dried through. 
Divide the crust and brown part from the crumb, and poimd 
them separately till in very fine powder. Put them into jars, 
and keep them in a dry place. The white crumbs are to be used 
for sweetbreads, cutlets, fried fish, puddings, &c. The brown 
crumbs are to be used for hams, bacon, colouring broth, &c. Any 
pieces of bread there may be, should be baked daily^ as the 
bread shotdd not be stale, and pounded twice or thrice a week. 

Burnt Sugary for colouring Soups^ ^c. — ^Put a quarter of a 
pound of sifred loaf sugar into a small iron saucepan (untinned), 
and place it over the fire to bake, till it becomes black, but not 
crisp, like a cinder ; add a pint of water, and simmer till the 
sugar dissolves, and the water is reduced to half a pint. Strain 
through a cloth, and when cold, bottle and keep for use. Great 
care is required in colouring, not to put too much, or it will 
spoil what it is intended to improve, both in appearance and 
flavour. It must be used bi/ drops till the desired effect is 
attained. 

Black Onions, for Soups, ^c. — Peel six large onions, and place 
them on a tin dish. Knead together a quarter of a poimd of 
salt butter and a quarter of a pound of moist sugar ; divide it 
into six equal parts, and place one on each onion. Put them into 
a slow oven, and bake till they are black through, but not burnt 
crisp. Baste them frequently with the liquor. When done, put 
them into a pie-dish, and keep for use. These onions give a 
finer colour to soup and gravy than anything else ; they also 
impart a good flavour. 

Weights and Measures. — ^As the same weights and measures 
are not used everywhere, it is necessary to state that those re- 
ferred to in this book are avoirdupois, i. e. sixteen ounces to the 
pound, and imperial, i.e. twenty liquid ounces to the pint. 
Sieves vary even in London, therefore by a sieve must be under- 
stood fourteen dry quarts. 

Seasoning. — The over use of seasoning will spoil every other 
flavour, while the moderate use brings it out and improves the 
dish. Great care has been taken in stating the quantities to be 
used, and they should be strictly adhered to. Many persons 
object to all condiments, while others like them profusely em- 
|>loyed. This can only be ascertained by the cook at first follow- 



REMARKS AND DIRECTIONS TO BE REMEMBERED. clix 

ing the receipts, and then, if alteration be necessary, decrease or 
increase the quantities to suit the palates she cooks for. The 
nutmegs referred to in the different receipts must not weigh more 
than the sixth of an ounce, or if they be larger, less in proportion 
must be used. By a graiyi is meant the fortieth part of a drachm ; 
and of most things a cayenne-spoonful will be equal to a grain. 
A drachm is the eighth part of an oomce ; and of many things a 
teaspoonful is equal to a drachm. 

Garlic, — Garlic must be used very carefully, or it will spoil 
what it is intended to improve. Strict attention, therefore, must 
be paid to the directions contained in each receipt when this 
vegetable is used. 

Condiment Sauces, — Ketchup and other condiment sauces must 
be used in moderation. Cre-fydd's* casureep will be found to 
be a convenient sauce, as no other condiment nor wine need be 
added when it is used. It imparts an agreeable flavour to aU 
brown soups and made dishes. 

* Cre-fydd's Condiment Sauces, prepared only by J. B. Westmp, Chemist, 
(sole proprietor of the receipts), 1 St. Peter's Terrace, Kensington Park, 
and sold by him and his agents, in bottles, at l^. each.

NoTB 1. — Skimming may seem unnecessary, but if neglected, the scum 
adheres to the fish, and destroys the good appearance. If time be of con- 
sequence, it will be well to boil the fish in a cloth, as follows : Place the 
fish upon the drainer, throw a large clean cloth over the handles, and 
pin it underneath the plate so as not to touch the fish, but to completely 
cover it. This renders skimming unnecessary.

VEGETABLES. 

396. NEW POTATOES. 

Rub off the skin with a rough cloth ; let them stand half an 
hour in cold water; put them into boiling water with a salt- 
spoonful of salt, and boil about ten minutes. Drain quite dry, 
and serve with an ounce of fresh butter in the centre of the 
potatoes, or on a hot napkin, neatly folded. 

397. TO RE-DRESS NEW POTATOES. 

Cut the cold potatoes into slices as thick as a halfcrown ; put 
them into a stewpan, with an ounce of butter to the pound, a 
saltspoonfiil of salt, a teaspoonful of chopped parsley, a saltspoonful

pan till the potatoes are quite hot ; then pour over half a gill of 
cream, and in five minutes serve. 

398. POTATOES, PLAIN. 

Pare the potatoes neatly ; place them on a plate ; put a pint 
and a half of water into a deep saucepan ; turn a half-pint saucer 
or pot upside down, and place the plate with the potatoes on it 
on the saucer ; let the water boil rapidly. Good-sized potatoes 
require half an hour to steam thus. Serve on a hot napkin and as 
quickly as possible, that they may be mealy and white. An ordi- 
nary steamer may be used, but this mode will be found as good. 

399. MASHED POTATOES. 

Pare the potatoes, and steam them half an hour ; turn them 
into a hot basin, and with a wooden spoon bruise them to flour ; 
to three pounds add three saltspoonfuls of salt, three ounces of

each quarter into two ; let them stand in cold water ten minutes ; 

drain, and wipe them quite dry ; throw them into a stewpan 

half filled with boiling fet, and fry to a pale brown colour. Take 

them out with a slice, and place them on a sheet of white blotting 

paper on a sieve, to absorb the fat before serving. 

Note. — There are wire nets made to fit stewpans, expressly for fiying 
potatoes, into which they are placed and plunged into the fat, and when done 
quickly withdrawn. This mode insures the potatoes being better done and 
with less trouble. 

402. GREEN PEAS, PLAIN. 

The peas must be young, fi:esh gathered, and fresh shelled. A 
pint and a half of peas will require three pints of water, with a

CONDIMENT AND OTHER SAUCES, 
KETCHUP, AND PICKLES. 

(In making all condiment sauces, attention must be paid to the most 
minute direction. The vessel used must be uncovered throughout the 
whole process, to let the steam pass oflf; without this, the sauce will not 
keep. The same remarks will apply to ketchups and pickles.) 

832. TOMATO SAUCE. 
(To be made in October.) 

The tomatoes must be ripe, and gathered in dry weather. Half 
a sieve of tomatoes, four Spanish onions, two ounces of shalot,

of cayenne, a quart of good vinegar, and a quart of strong old 
ale. Wipe the tomatoes with a soft cloth, and slice them ; peel 
and slice the onions, shalot, and garlic ; put them into a bright 
iron pot with the spice and the vinegar ; skim and stir frequently, 
and simmer for two hours. Add the ale ; then boil moderately 
fast for half an hour, or till the sauce thickens. Rub the whole, 
first through a coarse hair sieve, then through a fine one ; put it 
into dry wide-mouthed bottles, and, when cold, cork it tightly,

PRESERVES. 

Every kind of preserve should be made in a copper or brass 
preserving-pan (uncovered). It must be scrupulously clean and 
bright inside. The pots or bottles must be sound, and perfectly 
clean and dry. Pots should be filled within a quarter of an inch 
of the top; and bottles, just above the shoulder. The following 
day, they must be closely covered with strong cap paper,* which 
must be made to adhere round the edge, and then brushed over 
with the white of egg; so as to exclude the air. Each pot should 
be written upon, to show its contents and date of making. Fruit 
for jellies and jams must be quite ripe, fresh, and gathered in dry 
weather. The proportions are given in each receipt ; if they be 
used, and the directions strictly followed, the preserves cannot 
fail to be good, and the cost is something less than half that paid 
for those bought ready made. It may be well to know that the 
weight is reduced about one-third in making, and also that pots 
sold as * pound pots ' only hold thirteen oimces, and * half pound 
pots,' seven ounces. 

856. BLACK CURRANT JELLY. 

Make this jelly as directed in the following receipt, only boiling 
it ten minutes longer. 

857. RED CURRANT JELLY. 

Press out the juice from the currants, and strain it. Take the 
same weight of loaf sugar as of juice (three-quarters of a pint 
weighs one pound). Put the juice into a preserving-pan ; boil 
up, skim, and then put in the sugar ; stir with a wooden spoon 
till it dissolves ; skim constantly, and boil moderately fast for fifty 
minutes. Pour the jelly into pots, and the next day, cover them 
with cap paper, and brush that over with the white of egg. Two 
quarts of juice and five pounds of sugar will make sufficient 
jelly to fill twenty-four pots, six of each of the four first sizes. 

* The thin kind of whitey-brown paper is called cap paper. 



WHITE CURRANT, AND MIXED FRUIT JELLIES, EJC. 287

973. HINTS TO SERVANTS. 

In small establishments, where only two house servants are 
kept, the work is generally divided thus : — The cook takes the 
dining-room, library, hall, steps, kitchen stairs, kitchen, larder, 
and all offices below; the housemaid, all above the hall, her 
pantry, plate, china, and glass. Early rising will be found to add 
much to the comfort both of employers and servants. The work 
should be arranged in sucji a way that each day brings the same 
amount of labour. Every room and office should be thoroughly 
• cleaned once a week, and a day set apart for each. On those 
occasions, windows and sills should be cleaned, curtains brushed, 
and marks taken off paint. In bedrooms, mattresses and beds 
beaten and brushed, and the boards under the bed scrubbed. 
By doing this, the house is always clean, and with very little 
labour. Both servants should be clean and neat in their work. 
Things to be Remembered. — Answer bells immediately. Be 
careful not to drop lucifers about the house ; never strike them 
on the wall. Shut windows in foggy weather. Be careful to 
fasten all doors and windows at night. Do not let strangers into 
the house. Do not put plate where it can be seen by passers-by. 
Should any unpleasant smell arise fi*om sink or other drains, throw 
down a handful of chloride of lime, and let the water run. 
Never throw greenswater down drains ; let it get cold, then throw 
it on the earth in the garden. Bum aU vegetable matter, or

unwholesome smell arises; put nothing into the dust- bin but 
ashes. Do not throw human hair down drains or W.C.\ bum 
it. Do not throw bones into cellars or elsewhere, as they cause a 
bad smell. If kept for the purpose of selling, the precaution 
must be taken to boil them till quite bare, wash them in hot 
water, and dry them on the hearth ; if not, bum them. Keep 
all firesides neat, and let each fire bum up the cinders it makes. 
• Avoid putting things on the stairs or landings. Let everything 
have a place. Shut doors after you, by the handle, so as not to 
mark the paint. Use a fireside cloth and a housemaid's box for 
upstairs firesides. Always have a clean cloth expressly kept for 
chamber use. Wash out all utensils before wiping them. Put 
firesh water into jugs and bottles daily. Wear a large apron for 
bedmaking. Bedsteads should be taken down in spring and 
autumn, the woodwork and joints scrubbed, and the whole well 
cleansed ; the furniture brushed, and cleaned with bread, or 
washed. Carpets are kept in nice order by cleaning them once a 
year with bread. Never use dirty brooms, brushes, or dusters. 
Wear gloves in all dirty work. After cleaning fire-irons and 
coal-scuttles (which should be daily in the winter), wipe them 
with a cloth, so that they may not soil the hands when used. 
Never dust gilt frames with anything but a soft brush. Careful 
daily dusting preserves the furniture, and makes a house always 
look clean. Never put a tablecloth on the table with a spot on 
it. When there are any marks, lay the cloth on a clean table, dip 
a piece of flannel into hot water, and rub them till they dis- 
appear ; then fold the cloth smoothly, and put it into the press ; 
fi*equent washing wears out the cloths, and accidents will occur 
daily. Do not use soda, except for lamp and gas globes, other 
ground-glass, and rough kitchen work. Do not let workmen go 
upstairs in their thick dirty shoes. A pair of carpet-slippers or 
a pair of India-rubber overshoes shotdd be kept for the purpose. 
Lay down cloths where they are at work, if on a carpet. When 
rooms are swept, cover beds, sofas, &c. with sheets ; old sheets 
should be kept for dusting-sheets. Never use kitchen-cloths, 
dusters, &c. but for what they are intended ; and do not put them 
away wet, as they cause a ftisty smell, and will become mildewed.

318 A FEW THINGS WORTH KNOWING. 

Chimneys, — The kitchen chimney should be swept every five 
weeks. The discomfort on those occasions may be mucli lessened 
by arranging the hour according to the habits of the femily. 
The * upstairs work ' should be done before the sweep arrives, 
and that should be one hour before the family breakfast. A fire 
should be lighted elsewhere ; and after sending up the breakfast, 
the cook can remain in the kitchen till the cleaning is finished. 
Other chimneys are generally swept once a year (in May) ; but 
the dining-room, if constantly used, will require sweeping in 
December also. 

Cisterns, ^-The water should be drawn off once a fortnight, and 
the cisterns shotdd be cleaned out three times a year or oftener. 

Filter. — The sponges should be washed in two or three waters, 
and the filter should be well rinsed out once a week. 

Decanters, — Decanters and water-bottles should be cleaned 
with tea leaves and a bottle brush, and well rinsed with cold 
water, then turned upside down to drain. Be careful never to 
use soda, or any acid, it makes them look thick, cloudy, and 
white, instead of clear and brilliant. 

China and Glass, — Two clean tubs should be kept expressly 
for china and glass. Wash it well in warm water, and rinse in 
plenty of cold, and wipe with clean soft cloths. Be careful to 
keep the handles of cups and jugs clean. To take off tea stains 
use a little silver sand, or salt, but never soda. 

Gas, — The gas should be turned off at every burner before it 
is turned off at the meter. The gasliers should be dusted with a 
brush every day, and the globes washed every week. When the 
meter and gasliers are hydraulic, it is better to fill them up with 
water on the same day every week ; this will effectually prevent 
mistakes. 

Lamps, — The oil, cottons, and all things used for lamps, must 
be kept in a warm dry place. The oil must be closely corked. 
Lamps should be trimmed at once, when removed from the table 
they can then never be forgotten. Cut the wick close to the burner 
and quite even ; be careful not to drop it into the lamp. Fill the 
lamp with oil, within an inch of the top. Wipe the mouth of the 
lamp, the knobs, and the chimney holder ; clean the chimney 
with a stick covered with wash-leather and a little rotten- stone • 
dust the foot of the lamp, and put on the glasses ; care should be 
taken not to touch the groimd side of the globe, as it would 



HINTS ON CARVING. 319 

leave finger marks on it ; once a month generally is enough to 
wash the globe ; it must be perfectly dry before it is put on. 
Wind up the lamp ten minutes before lighting ; turn up the 
cotton the third of an inch ; light it all round with a wax lighter ; 
put on the chimney ; the shoulder of the chimney should be half 
an inch above the flame; when regulated, put on the globe. 
The cotton must be changed every four days. These directions 
are given for a * Moderator Lamp.' 

Candles. — Candlesticks should be cleaned every morning. In 
fixing candles, cross two pieces of paper (two inches and a half 
long) over the socket, and force the candle in ; they will then be 
perfectly upright and steady, and the paper not seen. If candles 
gutter, scrape oflf the waste. 

Clocks, — Wind up clocks regularly; never turn the hands 
back to alter the time. 

974. HINTS ON CARVING. 

Fish. — Salmon, — Cut salmon lengthways, into slices the third 
of an inch thick and three inches long. A small piece of the 
thin part, which is the fat, should be sent to each guest. A 
sharp knife should be used. 

Turhot and Brill. — Eun the fish-knife along the middle of the 
fish, fi'om head to tail ; then cut the sides into pieces two inches 
broad. Serve a portion of the fin to each person. The white 
side of the fish is the best, and the thick part is the most 
esteemed. 

John Dory and large Tor Bay Soles may be carved like as 
turbot, &c. The cheek of the dory is the epicure's piece. 

Cod. — ^Pass the fish-knife through the back, to raise the fish 
from the bone, and serve it in flakes from the back (the thin part 
is woolly), with a portion of the liver and soimd. Haddock is 
caxved in die same way as cod. 

Meat. — Mutton should be cut a quarter of an inch thick, 
whether boiled or roasted. A little fat and gravy should be sent 
to each person. 

Haunch, — ^Place the point of the knife over the bone, about 
four inches above the knuckle, and cut through the thick part of 
the leg; then cut slices lengthways. Saddle. — Cut the slices 
lengthways from each side of the backbone. Leg^ — Ma.kft. «ss. 
incision through the thick part of lii^le^, «eA\i^^^^'^^^^''°^ 



320 A FEW THINGS WORTH KNOWING. 

both sides ; or it may be caxved * haunch fashion.' Loin may be 
either carved as the saddle or cut into chops. Shoulder is cut 
through the straight or lean side. Lamb, fore-quarter. — The 
shoulder should be taken off by the cook, but replaced to send 
to table ; or if not taken off by the cook, must be taken off 
by the carver, and placed on a separate dish. Carve lamb as 
directed for mutton. 

Beef. — The underside of the sirloin should be cut across the 
bones into slices the third of an inch thick. The upper side, 
lengthways, and in slices the fifth of an inch thick. A little fiit 
and gravy sent on each plate. 

Ribs should be carved lengthways and cut thin. 

Aitchbone, — Cut from the narrow and fet side and in as thin 
slices as possible. The suet fat is best when hot. All salt beef 
should be cut thin. 

Veal. — ^The fillet must be cut from the round part in very 
thin slices ; stuffing and gravy should be served to each person. 

Loin, neck, and chump end of loin should be cut into slices 
the sixth of an inch thick. 

Pork. — Cut the leg through the middle, close to the bone. 
Serve slices a quarter of an inch thick. If stuffed, send stuffing 
and gravy on each plate. A boiled leg of pork, and all other 
parts salted, should be cut the sixth of an inch thick. 

Ham should be cut as thin as possible, unless cooked in the 
Spanish way, when the slices should be a quarter of an inch 
thick. In either case, place the knife three inches above the 
knuckle, which should be to your left hand, slanting toward the 
knuckle ; cut off the piece down to the knuckle ; then carve the 
ham in very thin slices, fat and lean. A ham cut in this way 
looks better and goes farther than when cut as a leg of pork, as 
it often improperly is. 

Bacon must always be cut thin. 

Tongue. — Cut the thick part of the tongue down to the root, 
but not through, and serve slices a quarter of an inch thick. 

Bath Chap. — Cut very thin slices from the thick part of the 
chap lengthways. A small piece of the tongue, if any, should 
be sent to each person. 

Fowls. — Fix the fork in the middle of the breast, and do not 
remove it till the iovf\ i«» cwt u^. First take off the legs thus : 
Place the point of l\ie "kiiii^ ^^\. -vxxA^i xic.^ \icL\^^ ^^iX ^3caQu^h the 



HII^TS ON CARVINO. 321 

skin, turn the leg back, and separate it from tlie body ; then take 
off the wings by placing the knife down the side of the breast, in 
the line with the joint of the wing, and cut through to joint, and 
separate it. Place the knife across the breast, half an inch below 
the point of the breast-bone, slanting towards the neck, and 
remove the merrythought ; then take off the small bones called 
the flyers, which present their points on each side of the neck ; 
then cut through the ribs on both sides*; pull up the fork with 
the breast. The back, if wanted, may be cut across into three 
pieces. Slices may be taken off the breast. 

Ducks, — Slice the breast lengthways, and cut up in the same 
way as fowls. 

Turkey is frequently boned, and stuffed with a tongue and 
forcemeat. Cut slices lengthways the fifth of an inch thick, and 
sufficiently deep to cut through the tongue and stuffing. If not 
boned, cut slices off the breast, l^s, and wings. Disjoint as 
directed for fowls. 

Goose is carved in the same way as ducks, afler removing in 
slices the meat from the breast. The stuffing will be found in 
the body. Cut through the skin below the breast, and insert a 
spoon. Send stuffing on each plate. 

Pheasants are carved like fowls. 

Partridges, — If the birds are small, cut them through the 
breast and back lengthways, and then each half into two ; or they 
may be carved like a fowl. 

Chouse is carved like a partridge. 

Hare, — Cut slices lengthways off the back and legs; the 
stuffing is in the body. Turn over the hare, and cut it open. 
Send stuffing on each plate. For inexperienced carvers, tlie 
better way is to order the hare to be boned-

POTTED VEAL AND TONGUE AND 

• PATTIES. 

(The five following receipts were not sent to the press with the rest of the 
work, which will account for their being placed out of order. ) 

1. POTTED VEAL AND TONGUE. 

Three-quarters of a pound of cold roast or braised veal, a 
quarter of a pound of tongue, both free from skin, fat, and dry 
pieces ; mince, and then pound them together till in a soft paste ; 
add, while pounding, two tablespoonfuls of veal gravy ; season 
with a teaspoonful and a half of good anchovy-sauce, half a mus- 
tardspoonftd of fresh-made mustard, a saltspoonftd and a half of 
white pepper, the tenth part of a nutmeg, grated. Cross the 
bottom of the pestle once with garlic, and continue to pound till 
the seasoning is well mixed with the meat ; then add five ounces 
of dissolved fresh butter. When the whole is become a soft 
paste, put it into a raised pie-dish, press it well in, smooth the 
top over with a knife, pour over an ounce and a half of dissolved 
butter, and keep it in a cool place till wanted. 

2. VEAL AND HAM PATTIES. 

Mince half a pound of cold roast veal and two ounces of lean 
cooked ham ; season with the grated rind of half a lemon, the 
tenth part of a nutmeg, grated, half a saltspoonful of white 
pepper, half a saltspoonful of salt, a teaspoonful of grated Par- 
mesan cheese, and a tablespoonftd of baked flour ; put it into a 
saucepan, with veal stock, (No. 2) or milk, enough to well moisten 
it, and simmer gently, stirring constantly, for a quarter of an 
hour. Add the strained juice of half a lemon and half a gill of 
thick cream. Make a paste, and proceed as directed in the fol- 
lowing receipt Turkey, fowl, or pheasant may be used instead 
of veal. 



OYSTER AND LOBSTER PATTIES. 323 

3. OYSTER PATTIES. 

Strain the juice of a lemon into a gill of cold water, and stir in 
sufficient to well moisten three-quarters of a pound of dry sifted 
flour ; knead to a smooth paste ; lay it on a slab, and spread over 
three-quarters of a pound of good fresh butter ; turn over the four 
sides, dredge with flour, and roll out ; fold it again, and roll it 
out four times ; then fold it in three, and let it stand in a cool 
place for two hours. Have ready two circular patty cutters, one 
two inches and a half across, and the other one inch and a half. 
Roll the paste out the third of an inch thick ; dip the cutters 
into flour, and cut out eight of the larger size ; press the smaller 
size on the centre of each piece of paste, cutting it the sixth of 
an inch deep. Roll out the remainder of the paste, and cut out 
eight of the smaller pieces ; place them all on a baking tin, and 
bake in a quick oven till of a pale brown colour, about twenty 
minutes. Take them out, and with a sharp penknife remove the 
centre paste from the larger sized pieces. Fill the vacancy with 
oysters prepared as follows. Place the smaller piece, or lid, over, 
and send to table on a neatly folded hot napkin. Take ofi* the 
beards of two dozen of oysters 5 throw the oysters into boiling 
water ; put the beards and the liquor into a saucepan, with half 
an inch of mace, the tenth part of a nutmeg, grated, the thin 
rind of half a lemon, a grain of white pepper, a quarter of a 
grain of cayenne, and boil fast for ten minutes. Strain ; cut the 
oysters into six pieces ; stir a tablespoonful of Oswego flour into 
half a gill of thick cream ; put the oysters into the liquor, add a 
tablespoonful of lemon juice, simmer two minutes; stir in the 
cream, and, when thickened, fill the patties as directed. 

4. LOBSTER PATTIES. 

Make a paste, and proceed as directed in the foregoing receipt, 
using lobster instead of oysters. Take the meat out of a good- 
sized hen lobster, and chop it smaU ; put the shells into half a 
pint of milk, with half an inch of mace, the thin rind of half a 
lemon, the tenth part of a nutmeg, grated, half a grain of 
cayenne, a gmin of white pepper, a quarter of a saltspoonful of 
salt, and simmer for ten minutes ; then strain. Put the lobster 
into the milk, and simmer for five minutes. Stir a dessertspoon- 
ful of Oswego flour into half a gill of thick cream, and add to 

the rest ; stir till it thickens, then fiU the patties as directed*

324 WELSH BABBIT. 

5. WELSH RABBIT. 

Cut a round of bread half an inch thick off a t'wo-pound loaf, 
trim off the crust and outside edge ; spread it thickly with butter. 
Cut up about half a pound of rich cheese in as thin slices as 
possible ; knead a teaspoonM of £our of mustard and a grain of 
cayenne with an ounce and a half of butter ; stir it before the fire 
till liquid, but not oily. Lay half of the cheese upon the bread ; 
pour half of the butter equally over ; put the rest of the cheese 
upon that ; pour the remainder of the butter over the top ; place 
it in a cheese-toaster, or in a Dutch oven, and bake before the 
fire for eighteen or twenty minutes. The bread should swell to 
nearly double the thickness, and the cheese should be of a thick 
creamy substance, very slightly browned. Serve very hot.
