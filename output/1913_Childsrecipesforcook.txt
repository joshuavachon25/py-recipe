MISCELLANEOUS. 



APPLE SAUCE. 

Quarter, core, remove all seeds, specks and 
dark spots in apples and drop pieces in cold 
water to prevent discoloring. It is very im- 
portant that the apples prepared for cook- 
ing be absolutely free from dark spots, seeds 
and cores, as these will darken the sauce. 

When cooked, force through colander, 
sweeten to taste and place in a stone crock 
to cool. 



MATZOON FOR BAKING PURPOSES. 

Heat 40 quarts of skimmed milk to 210 de- 
grees; take from the fire and cool as quickly 
as possible to 110 degrees, when it will be 
ready to add the starter. The proportion is 
1 quart of starter to 40 quarts of milk. Keep 
between 90 and 100 degrees for 3 hours. By 
that time it should contain from 7 to 10 per 
cent, of lactic acid. Should more acid be 
desired, it can stand at that temperature for 
a longer time. To prevent its containing too 
high a percentage of acid it may be put in an 
ice box and cooled to about 40 degrees. 
Should you at any time wish it to contain 
more acid, take it from the ice box and keep 
moderately warm, about 70 degrees; you will 
find the percentage of acid will increase within 
a few hours.

MATZOON, ORIGINAL PRODUC- 
TION OF. 

1 qt. milk 
1 teaspoonful sugar 
Vs cake compressed yeast 

Dissolve the yeast and sugar in a small 
quantity of the milk that has been slightly 
heated in order to set the yeast plant working. 
The remainder of the milk should be boiled 
and then cooled to lukewarm. In an hour, 
when the yeast begins to show bubbles on 
the top, add the milk mixture. Put into small 
bottles, and if the corks do not fasten with a 
spring snap, tie firmly in place, lest the fer- 
menting gases drive them out. Let the bottles 
stand for three hours in a warm place, then 
put in a moderately cool place for two days, 
shaking thoroughly three or four times a day. 
On the third day open the bottles to allow 
the effervescence to pass off. This will take 
from 10 to 15 minutes. Whip with an egg 
beater, return to the bottles and put directly 
on the ice to prevent a return of the fermen- 
tation. As soon as the matzoon is chilled it 
is ready for use. It may thicken slightly 
during its exposure to the air, but this does 
not hurt it. 



PRUNES. 

54 lemon 

2 tablespoonfuls molasses 
Vyi lbs. sugar

then put in a tin can; dissolve the sugar in 
the water and add to the prunes, together 
with the molasses, orange and lemon. Seal 
the can and cook 45 minutes under a 6-pound 
steam pressure. 



SPAGHETTI A LA MARTINELLI. 

3 lbs. spaghetti 
1 qt. tomatoes 
1 qt. beef stock

APPENDIX 

RULE FOR TESTING MILK. 

We have found that the Babcock machine 
will give an accurate test for the percentum 
of butter fat in milk but does not give the 
solids, which are as important as the butter 
fat. Should the solids be below 12 percentum, 
the milk is adulterated. In order to find the 
solids it is necessary to take a lactometer 
and Babcock Test, and follow the rule given 
below: 

Multiply lactometer reading by .29 

Multiply butter fat reading by .7 

add the results and divide by 3.8. Add the 

butter fat to the result, which will give the 

total solids. 

Example 1. 

Lactometer 99 X -29 = 2871 

Butter Fat 3.3 X .7 = 2 31 

28.71+2.31=31.02 

31.02^3.8 = 8.16 

8.16 + 3.3 =11.46 total solids, 

ivhicli sJiows milk adulterated. 

Example 2. 

Lactometer 107 X .29 = 31.03 
Butter Fat 4% X .7 = 2.8 
31.03 + 2.8 =33.83 
33.83^3.8 = 8.9 
8.9 + 4 =12.9 total solids, 
zvhich sJwzvs pure milk. 

Spencer's Lactometers can be bought from 
any dairy supply house for $2.00. Accompany- 
ing the Lactometer should be rules for read- 
ing it.

STANDARD FOR FRUIT AND 
VEGETABLES. 

In selecting fruit for our use the buyer 
should be careful to get only what is first- 
class. Such fruit is ripe, t-ll-Havured and 
good-sized. The size for our use should be 
average, not abnormally large nor small. The 
buyer must appreciate the fact that the dealer 
can readily sell all his fine fruit, and, there- 
fore, will be likely to put out inferior goods 
to those who do not demand the better sort. 
We hold buyer and manager responsible for 
the kind of fruit served, and in order that 
they may know the natural principles govern- 
ing the procuring of fruit trom tiie market 
we have prepared the following information: 

Oranges: — 96 California navels per box; 
weighing 80 to 90 pounds per box; must be 
sweet, full of juice, thin skin, fine grain. 

Grape Fruit — 54 per box; Floridas are the 
best flavor and weigh about 85 pounds per 
box, July, August, September and October 
we must depend on California grape fruit 
which has been carried in cold storage. They 
look nicer than the Floridas, but will weigh 
about 10 pounds less per box and are more 
bitter. 

Lemons: — 360 per box weighing 75 to 80 
pounds; thin skin and full of juice. 

Strawberries: — The standard size for a 
strawberry basket is a full quart. When 
smaller baskets are shipped they are su(>posed 
to be marked "short," but that is not always 
done; so the buyer must see that he gets the 
standard size basket, well filled with an even 
rim of berries from top to bottom and free 
from dirt. 

Good berries arrive in market from April 
15th to July 4th. The best berries are as 
follows: The Middletown & Haffman are 
good early berries, dark red, with a good gloss. 
A great many are shipped from Florida. The 
Gandy is a large berry, sweet and mellow and 
looks nice on the table. They come from 
Maryland. Delaware, New Jersey and New 

76 



York. Other good berries are the Missionary, 
Hefner, Klondike and Climax, The greater 
number of these berries come from Norfolk, 
Va., North and South Carolina and Georgia. 
The Excelsior is a small berry, very dark red, 
and best where only the extract is required. 

Raspberries: — These berries are in the 
market about July 1st and last until about 
August 20th. They are shipped in pint bas- 
kets, and the buyer should be very careful to 
see that the baskets are well filled, dry and 
free from mold. The berry known as the 
Cuthbert is large and of good flavor, full of 
juice and with the seeds well covered. Most 
of them come from New York and New 
Jersey. 

Blackberries are supposed to be shipped in 
quart baskets, but sometimes come in baskets 
that do not hold a full quart. In buying, 
select large berries, very black, with a good 
gloss, seeds well covered, full of juice and 
sweet. They are in the market from July 1st 
to August 15th. The best come from New 
York and New Jersey. 

Tomatoes are shipped in a number of dif- 
ferent kinds of crates and packages, and the 
buyer should go over them and cull out all 
but the large, smooth, deep red fruit. 

Peaches must be large and of uniform size; 
freestone, clean around pit: sweet and full ot 
juice. Crates should run 150 to 175. In get- 
ting peaches the buyer will notice the package 
they are shipped in and how packed, as the 
best fruit is always carefully shipped in good 
packages. The best early peaches are the 
Georgia Elbertas. which begin to c^^me in 
about June 10th. Like all the early fruit, this 
variety has been stung by an insect which 
forces it to ripen before it has matured, so 
that when broken open it will be black 
around the pit, and will be bitter from about 
June 18th to July 25th. Our best Georgia 
Elberta peaches are uniform in size and 
come about 150 peaches per crate. They 
have a clean skin red on one side showing 
that they have ripened in the sun on the 

77 



tree, and were not picked green and ripened 
in transportation, i-iiit npenea on the tree 
will be ju-cier and have a much better tiavor, 
and when broken open the pit can be re- 
moved very easily. 

From July 25th to August 12th we have 
found it necessary to place enough Georgia 
peaches in cold storage to carry us along 
until the Missouri and West Virginia Elberta 
peaches arrive. These last until the Con- 
necticut and Delaware peaches come in. The 
last peaches in market are from New Jersey 
and New York. The New York. New Jersey 
and Delaware fruit has the best flavor, but 
the peaches from New Jersey and Delaware 
are not packed nor graded so well as those 
from Georgia, and in order to get nothing 
but the fancy fruit it is necessary to cull out 
ail that will not pass as fancy. 

Watermelons from Florida and Georgia cut 
the best. They should weigh from 33 to 40 
pounds, cut a deep red and be tine grained and 
sweet. Insist that the buyer pick out only 
perfectly shaped melons and refuse to accept 
the ill-shaped ones. 

Cantaloupes: — 36 to 45 per crate, each melon 
wrapped in paper. Refuse soft melons and 
those that have been picked too green, with 
very small space for seeds. They should be 
ripe, iirm and sweet, and show a dark green 
color when cut. The first cantaloupes suitable 
for our trade arrive in the market from Cali- 
fornia about June 12th and last until about 
July 31st. The finest come from the California 
Fruit Association, which ^usually ships only 
the best, running about 45 to a crate. They 
are of uniform size and well filled, with very 
little room for seeds. When cut they are 
green and firm, much better than melons that 
are yellow when cut. The New Mexico melons 
come in about August 5th. packed and shipped 
by the Lyon-Congins Cantaloupe League. 
These melons are shipped in crates that run 
from 36 to 45 per crate and each one is 
wrapped in paper. The quality is verv good, 
but they are not so well filled as the Cali- 

78 



fornia melons. The buyer should use care 
in picking out these melons, as often some 
are picked so green they will never ripen 
enough to be first-class. The produce dealer 
will pick out ripe melons if the buyer insists 
upon it. We should get melons from Mexico 
until August 20th, when the Rocky Ford 
melons come in. They are much the same as 
the California melons, well packed, graded and 
run 45 per crate, the proper size for our use. 

Apples: — Baldwins, Northern Spies, Kings 
and Greenings are the best winter apples for 
our use, and should run from 380 to 420 bak- 
ing apples per barrel. The best early apples 
are Early Sours, English Codlins, Fall Pip- 
pins and Twenty-ounce Pippins. 

Lettuce: — December to March; Florida, 
North Carolina and South Carolina field let- 
tuce, also Boston Hot House, which is usually 
the best. April to September; Long Island 
field. October to December; Boston Hot 
House. 

Parsley: — November to April; Bermuda or 
New Orleans. Bermuda is usually the best. 
April to November; nearby. 

Cress: — Gathered at springs in Pennsylvania 
and Virginia. 

Potatoes: — June 15th to July 20th; Norfolk, 
Va., Spaulding No. 4 or Irish Cobblers, 
whichever are larger. July 20th to August 
20th; Jersey Cobbler from South Jersey. 
August 20th to September 15th; Green Moun- 
tains from South Jersey. September 15th to 
October 15th; New York State Rurals. Oc- 
tober 15th, balance of season; Rurals or Green 
Mountains from New York State, whichever 
are coming in best.
