PREFACE 



The prevailing custom among the best hotels 
and restaurants of printing their menus in French 
has resulted in a continually increasing number 
of guests who demand of the waiter a descrip- 
tion of a dish before ordering it. The waiter 
frequently guesses, often wide of the mark, and 
the result is a disappointed and dissatisfied guest, 
or the waiter Toothers a too busy chef whose des- 
cription is necessarily l^rief, hurried and incom- 
plete. The latter way consumes a waiter's valu- 
able time and tries the patience of a hungry and 
waiting diner. , \ 

My aim, therefore, in compiling this bool^ has 
been to supply head waiters and waiters with 
immediate, accurate and sufficiently detailed in- 
formation to enable them to quickly ^furnish a 
patron with a satisfactory descriptioii^oi any dish 
on the menu. - u '*'A /^ ' . 

Chefs, managers, stewards^ #€^li|i^'iw^iters, 
housewives, etc., furthermore willJ:^f?<Jv5^L^tiames 
or recipes of many dishes not to ^^kyn^ else"^ 
where, and" the descriptions, tJiQUgh B:^itf, are 



sufficient for any one for the variation of their 
menus. 

Forty-five years of experience in the best 
and largest hotels and restaurants of Europe 
and America, as stated below, has enabled me 
to collect over 8,000 recipes as made by them. 
This '^Encyclopedia" will facilitate the work be- 
tween the dining-room and the kitchen, enable 
both to ''pull together," expedite the service, 
and prove generally satisfactory. 

That my colleagues and all interested will 
find therein a realization of my aims, is the 
sincere v/ish of 

Yours fraternally, 

J. CANCEL.

AVANT-PROPOS 

(Introduction) 



In presenting this culinary book to the public, I can 
conscientiously say that it is the most complete and up- 
to-date book ever prepared on the subject. 

A large portion of this book has been translated from 
mj' French book. 

I am noi a literary man, but I know that even with 
the difficulty that exists in expressing in English many 
of the French terms, this book will be easily understood 
and greatl}^ appreciated. 

This is the first time in history that such a wonder- 
ful collection of recipes has been made obtainable for 
general use. A careful study of the recipes and care- 
ful application of the directions for same is all that is 
necessary to produce the results that have become 
famous. 

One word about the transformation of the ancient to 
the modern cooking. The application of fire for cook- 
ing purposes dates from the time or betv/een the time 
of the Anthropophagi and the Aryan race when 
men drank the blood of animals, ate the intestines and 
roasted the carcass. It is difficult to precise at just 
what epoch man used fire for cooking. It is historically 
known that civilization and culinary luxuries existed 
with the Greeks to a high degree of perfection and 
were greatly superior to our modern cooking; also the 
Greeks were advanced eighteen centuries before the 
Italians, Germans, Russians and Gauls in the art of 
cooking. The French are universally known as the 
best culinary artists. It is always with a dinner that 
we celebrate three phases in life, namely: birth, marri- 
age and death. 

Certain authors claim that the kitchen is a temple 
and the range an altar. Unfortunately, all kitchens 



are not temples, and in my long experience in hotels 
and restaurants I certainly have come across a great 
many obstacles. 

A model kitchen is yet to be made. The architect or 
proprietor does not wish to consult with competent 
culinary people. Of course, I speak for certain houses. 

When one sees the magnificent and gorgeous hotels 
and restaurants and then visits the kitchens, which are 
mostly situated in basements, obscure and badly venti- 
lated, it must be realized how an hygienic installation 
is necessary. 

There are a few modern hotels and restaurants who 
have commenced to reconstruct the kitchens, but it 
will take a long time to establish an hygienic one. An 
hygienic kitchen should conform to the necessities of 
the work. 

When you see the cooks come out of the basement 
kitchens, pale and very often rheumatic, it is no wonder 
that they are so, considering that they have been shut 
up in such an atmosphere, forced to inhale the gas 
from the range and the fumes generating in the cook- 
ing utensils. Pressed by the headwaiter and others 
for two or three consecutive hours to "hurry up," these 
men return to their homes tired out. Give to these 
men sanitary, hygienic, well lighted and ventilated 
kitchens. Such would be an act of humanity as well as 
a public necessity. 

The walls of the kitchens should be made of enameled 
bricks and the floors of concrete. The range, as much 
as possible in the center, surrounded by an iron grat- 
ing, sprinkled with sawdust, a ventilator and aspiring 
apparatus to aspire the heat and steam that escapes. 
The tables and shelves should be made of steel, to facili- 
tate their cleaning. All of the table service should be 
kept in the heating oven. All the cooking utensils 
should be in bi-metal, copper or aluminum. Enameled 
utensils should never be used, and should be strictly 
prohibited, as there is great danger of pieces of enamel 
breaking and mixing with the food, which causes ap- 
pendicitis and other serious diseases.

HORS-D'OEUVRE 

DIFFERENT VARIETIES OF RELISHES 

Many relishes are served for Entrees 

The ancient Greeks and Romans considered relishes 
a great delicacy, so it is nothing new in the modern 
cooking of today. 

There are two different kinds of relishes, hot and 
cold, and should be served before the soup, principally 
the cold ones, as the hot relishes are sometimes served 
as small entrees. 

But if the hot relishes are desired, one should be 
careful not to serve the same as any other dish already 
composing the menu. 

There are a great many varieties of hot and cold rel- 
ishes, and they should be made very fancy to excite 
the appetite. 

Cold relishes such as oysters, caviar, olives, radishes, 
celery and sardines should be kept on ice or in a cool 
place and served only a few seconds before eating.

EGGS (Oeufs) 

Eggs are an excellent aliment for children, also for 
sick and feeble people. They, however, must be abso- 
lutely fresh. They lose all of their nourishment if they 
are hard boiled. 

Eggs sv/allowed raw, or eaten soft boiled are the 
best. Also scrambled, fried, poached and in very soft 
omelet. (Mollet boiled 5 minutes). Eggs most used 
for culinary purposes are those of the domestic chicken, 
duck and ostrich. The eggs of fish are extracted before 
the time of hatching. 

The greatest delicacy in fish eggs are those of the 
sturgeon which are used for fresh and salted caviar. 
The eggs of shad and herring are eaten cooked. The 
eggs of reptiles are rarely used in alimentation, only 
turtle and terrapin, and they are eaten raw or cooked, 
soft boiled or in omelet highly spiced. 

There are more than 500 ways of preparing eggs. 
Most of the preparations can be changed with the same 
garnishings as the cook desires, or to suit the person's 
taste. 

A chicken egg weighs two ounces. You can tell a 
fresh egg when it is full and transparent in the light. 
A simple way of knowing when an egg is fresh is to 
put it in a bowl of water and an 8th part of kitchen 
salt. If the egg goes to the bottom, it is fresh; if it 
stays in the middle of the water it is two or three days 
old; but if it floats it is five days old. Different styles 
of eggs bearing the same name are not repeated, but 
may be garnished the same, wether they be poached, 
scrambled or omelet. 

For moulded eggs, the moulds should be well but-

tered, decorated, sprinkled and lined. When eggs are 
without croustade (crust), they may be served on can- 
ape, garnished according to the article. Sauces should 
all he thin. 

Scrambled eggs are garnished with lozenges of fried 
bread or puff paste. 

Time for cooking moulded eggs in hot water (bain 
marie) is ten to twelve minutes. Eggs for stuffing 
must be hard boiled, then cut in half oblong shape and 
stuffed. A whole egg can be emptied with a column 
and then stuffed according to the order of the person. 
This last method is the best for fried or breaded eggs 
or chnud-froid sauce and decorated.

SAUCES 

There are three different kinds of sauces: 

Espagnole, Veloute and Bechamel. Of these three 
principal sauces are derived many others, with excep- 
tion of the Neutral ones, Neutral sauces meaning that 
they are not composed of juice meat or fish. The Es- 
pagnole sauce is brown and made of butter and Hour, 
aicistened with good meat juice (veal preferred) gar-

nished with Mirepoix (see Mirepoix in list of sauces). 
Let cook from 4 to 5 hours, then strain in an earthen 
pot and stir until cold, by intervals, of course. 

With this sauce Espagnole, one can make any., other, 
brown sauce, by adding wine and stock of articles and 
reduced to demi-glace. 

The sauce Veloute is the sister of the sauce Es- 
pagnole, one being brown and the other white. From 
these two sauces are derived a multitude of others; 
without the Veloute, the sauce Allemande cannot be 
made, as it is the base of all v/hite sauces. The 
Veloute sauce should be made v/ith good stock, such 
as fowl, veal or giblets of fowl, of sufficient quantity 
and garnished with onions, carrots, celery, leeks, aro- 
matics and a little salt. It must be cooked white in 
fresh butter and then moistened with the stock. Stir 
well, so that it will be smooth. It should be cooked 
from 1 to 2 hours, then take all of the grease off. 
Make the sauce Allemande in this manner: Separate 
the yolks of the eggs from the whites (6 eggs to one 
quart. Put the yolks in an earthen bowl, with 
a little mushroom juice, a little of the cold stock, 
the juice of a lemon. Whip the yolks well, put in little 
by little the Veloute. If hot, put on the fire and 
stir constantly so the yolks will cook without turn- 
ing. Strain through a sieve or fine cloth. When 
this sauce is finished it should be white and of a deli- 
cate taste. For Blanquette, Poulette, Fricasse, proceed 
in the same way with the stock of your article, adding 
mushrooms, chives, fine herbs or taragon. 

The sauce Bechamel is the Veloute added with cream 
during the reduction. 

The sauce Bechamel can be made with milk also in 
default of cream. Make a light brown flour with 
butter and add boiling cream or milk, whip well and 
season lightly. Cut in dice a carrot, an onion, a 
small piece of leek and the head of celery; fry all to- 
gether in butter, put all of the garnishings in the 
sauce. Cook slowly one hour, stir, strain, then finish 
with a piece of sweet butter. 

This sauce is used to thicken vegetables, cream

SAUCES 

soups, fish, eggs, all sauces having cream for their base, 
and all dishes not containing meat. 

Ail sauces for fish, white or brown are made of 
Veloute, Espagnole or Allemande with the reduction of 
the stock in v/hich they are cooked, and in the consist- 
ance of the sauce and in the seasoning. 

The sauces for chaud-froid are made with madeira 
or allemande, reduced from rich stock, meat jelly, 
fowl, fish and a few pieces of gelatine may be added. 
Reduce, strain through a fine cloth and stir until cold; 
when it is congealed cover the articles one wishes 
chaud-froider w. sa. 

Prohibition forbids the use of wines or liquors in 
cooking. Therefore it is very necessary to have all of 
the sauces distinctive and we-ll seasoned. 

Neutral Sauces 

S'auces under this name are made without meat juice, 
fish or fowl, such as: HoUandaise, Bearnaise, Bread, 
Horseradish and Mayonnaise. 

Cold Sauces 

Nearly all of the Cold sauces have for their base 
mayonnaise, adding ingredients such as oil and vinegar. 

All Preserved sauces universally known will be found 
here.

dominating element with which it is made. One can add 
to the jelly, calf's feet or gelatine well washed. Try the 
consistance on the ice before clarifying and seasoning.

CLAM-BAKE 
(Pique-Nique aux Clovisses) 

A clam-bake is one of the most primitive styles of 
cooking in America and is generally given at the sea- 
side in the month of July. Dig a hole in the ground, 
cover the bottom wth flat stones, in the form of a well 

— 150 — 



CRABS 

two or three feet long; make a large fire, enough to 
make the stones red. When there is nothing left but 
the ashes make a bed of sea-weeds. Put in small pack- 
ages (according to the number of guests) the clams, 
a small lobster, one-half chicken, fresh corn, a crab, 
some sweet potatoes and a sea bass, tie the cloth tight. 
Put all of the packages in hole and cover with sea weed 
Cover again with a piece of strong canvas, and recovei- 
with sand. The heat of the stones and the steam 
cook it thoroughly. After a couple of hours take off 
the sand very carefully and serve. One does not need 
any culinary capacity for this primitive style of cook- 
ing. The clam-bake is served at all sea-shore dinners, 
in small baskets, but these are only cooked in steam. 

The Barbecue 

The barbecue is a picnic of meat or large game, 
roasted or broiled on red hot coals. Mexican style: 
meat highly seasoned with aromatic herbs, put in small 
bags, and cooked in the ground. 

CRABS 

Crabs differ in their size and color, excepting the sea 
crabs or the countries where they are caught. Deep 
water crabs only should be eaten, but unfortunately it 
is not written on the shells. 

The meat of the crab should be white. It has a 
delicate taste, but is indigestable. Hard crab meat 
is sold already prepared. Take the meat out of the 
shell and be careful not to break the pieces. Have the 
sauce ready and mix it in gently. It is very necessary 
to take out all of the small bones of the crab. 

SOFT CRABS (Crabes Mous) 

Soft crabs are a transformation of hard crabs which 
change their shells two or three times a year. It is 
remarkable that during the mont]3s from March to

GANG EL'S CULINARY ENCYCLOPEDIA 

October the soft crabs are always accompanied by the 
hard crabs and at the slighest noise they cover the 
soft crabs with tlieir bodies. The lungs and tails of 
the soft crabs should be taken out and washed.

FROGS' LEGS (Grenouilies) 

Frogs are considered a great delicacy. The English 
call the French "Jack Frog" and we return the compli- 
ment by calling them "John Bull." 

Notwithstanding this criticism we are the masters in 
preparing them. The frog, to be good, should be eaten 
very fresh, and this is a simple method. Sprinkle with 
salt, and if the nerves contract, they are fresh; if not, 
they should not be eaten. All preparations for cook- 
ing frogs are excellent, such as: fried, saute, a la 
Poulette, etc. Frogs, nowadays, are served boneless 
to facilitate the service.

LOBSTERS and SPINY LOBSTERS 
(Homard et Langouste) 

In culinary art the lobster is considered one of the 
best of the deep-sea fishes. Thei-e are a great many 
different varieties, and also different styles of prepa- 
ration, which makes them an aliment of first choice. 




Baked Spiny Lobster 

Lobsters should be brought into the kitchen alive. 
They are of a dark green color and become red in the 
cooking. Never cook a dead lobster, nor eat any canned 
ones, as they are generally indigestable and sometimes 
poisonous. The spiny lobster is prepared in the same 
manner as the lobster, only the meat is harder. 

REMARKS — For lobster meat for divers uses, see 
under heading of Salpicon.

MUSSELS (Moules) 

The ordinary mussel which is found on the sea-shore, 
resembles the oyster. But everybody cannot eat mus- 
sels, as sometimes it causes nettle rash or symptoms 
of poisoning. In case of poisoning give the person a 
lemonade with a few drops of ether in it. Mussels 
are used in a multitude of fish garnitures. The Ma- 
riniere Mussels are the best. Clean thoroughly and 
put in water with a little salt, before they are served 
and do not use raw mussels that are opened when 
bought.

OYSTERS AND OYSTER-CRABS 
(Huitres et Crabes d'Huitres) 

The oyster is an ancient aliment of first choice. 
They are good only in the months which have "r," that 
is to say, from September to April. The fecundity of 
the oyster is remarkable. The oyster is hermaphrodite 
and hatches eggs two or three times in the year, which 
produce about two millions. The oyster should be 
eaten alive, and it is strange to say that it is one of 
the rare animated things that man will eat. 

The American is master in the art of eating oysters,

SNAILS (Escargots) 

Snails have a universal reputation, but have no 
nutritious value, apart from their culinary preparation. 
They are indigestible and demand a great many stimul- 
ant condiments. They should be cooked five or six 
hours, then the digestion is easy. Snails cooked in 
different wines designate their names. 

PREPARATION OF BURGUNDY SNAILS 
(Preparation d'Escargots de Bourgogne) 

Put the snails in a tub of water and throw salt over 
them. Let stand over night, then wash and scald. 
Take out when they commence to boil, then take out 
of the shells, and wash again in boiling water. Cook 
in the following manner. A garniture composed of 
carrots, onions, thyme, bay leaves and parsley, moisten 
with half white wi. and half bouillon, add salt, pepper 

— 167 — 



GANG EL'S GULINARY ENCYCLOPEDIA 

and spices. Cook on slow fire for five or six hours, let 
the snails get cold in their juice, prepare the Escargot 
butter (See "Escargot Butter"). When the shells are 
well dried garnish with a little escargot butter, put the 
snails back in their shells and close the shells with the 
butter. Let bake in a slow oven. See that the opening 
is kept straight so that the butter will not fall out.

preciated and in great demand. Put in boiling water.

imal dies of glanders, farcy or water leg. All large 
cities have their hippophagique butcheries. Paris in 
1869. London in 1878. For all preparations of horse

ORIENTAL DISHES 



ORIENTAL DISHES 
Chinese and Japanese 

Culinary art is very poor in China and Japan. The 
Japanese do not give the recipes for their cooking. I 
remember when I was at Sherrys' 20 years ago we were 
to prepare a dinner for Madame Burden who had just 
returned from Japan. Certain dishes were to be served 
as in Tokio, but we were never able to obtain any rec- 
ipes from them. They were willing to prepare the di]> 
ner themselves. Fortunately we had a few recipes and 
were able to serve the dinner. In Japan and China they 
put on the table in front of each guest a lacquertray 
covered with a napkin and a pair of traditional chop 
sticks, which serves as knife and fork, to nibble a few 
of the numerous dishes such as sesame seeds, fish frit- 
ters with green peas, oysterplant, fish in oil of sesame 
seed, raw dorade cut in small pieces, a great delicacy 
for the Japanese, radishes, leaves of cabbage pickled 
in brine, ginko, very much like apricots, gin-sing, soya 
root, the chy-wa-ly-yu, a very fine fish, the chin- chow, 
jelly of seaweed. Rice takes the place of bread and is 
the principal alimentation of the Japanese and is cooked 
in a special manner. The rice is of beautiful white color 
and very tender. The only thing left for us to learn is 
the chicken broth, beaten with yolk of eggs, and served 
in small Japanese cups with a cover. Their food is pre- 
pared without salt and to give it flavoring they put in 
it a sauce known as "soya" a sort of ketchup made of 
peas of soya, which they add to each dish. The "Saba- 
kiri" is a sort of dough or paste made with wheat and 
buckwheat in shape of macaroni. The "gobo" roots of 
China Aniseed, and shell fish are highly estimed. They 
put a piec-^ of these in all of the presents they make 
to their friends, as a token of sympathy. The "sake" is 
a Japanese brandy made from rice. In Japan and China 
the "soya bean" is an undispensable product like rice 
and wheat to Europeans. Flour is made out of the 
soya bean, also mush, bread, pastry, cheese and ket- 
chup.

SAUCE OF SOYA BEAN 

Cook the soya bean the same as fresh green peas. 
Take the coction when reduced. The pod of the bean 
is roasted and cooked separately with different season- 
ings, especially ginger, mace and mashed salted an- 
chovies. The two liquids are mixed, strained, reduced 
and then put in bottles. 

CHEESE OF SOYA BEANS) 

.^. Put fresh soya beans in water without salt. AVhen 
they are nearly cooked reduce the amount of water, 
then cook until tender. Pour in earthen jar, let stand 
until they form a jelly. Warm over again. Take off 
the liquid and strain, then add the liquid which is very 
i-ich, and a little milk or butter to make the ferment- 
ation. Salt it. Put in a cloth, let all the water drip 
off. Then the cheee is made and with age it is better. 
It is finished like potato cheese, which is dried on 
cheese stands and washed in salt water.

There are a great many different varieties of beef in 
America, France and England. The quality differs ac-

by a layer of fat, which is thick, firm and of a yellow

siderably. It must be of first quality, firm, 
white and elastic, and at least 6 weeks old. It is pre- 
pared and cooked in the same manner as beef. Vv^hite 
meats must be very well cooked. (See terms for cut- 
ting of meats.) Also garnitures of beef and sauces 
which accompany the meats. Time required to cook 
veal chops, 12 to 15 minutes. 

REMARKS — All articles to be braised should have 
the fat removed and the latter reduced, straned and 
added to the sauce and garnishings. Meats to be stuffed 
should be lightly saute on tbe side to be garnished, 
then pressed, trimmed and cooled before garnishing. 

For time required to cook, see note at head of "Beef."

GANCEL'S CULINARY ENCYCLOPEDIA 



LAMB AND MUTTON 

(AGNEAU ET MOUTON) 

Lamb and mutton are the best meats after beef.^ 
Lamb, after the age of six months, is called mutton. 
The meat of the lamb before two months has little 
flavor, is sticky, white and soft. After that time it is 
delicious, especially if the animal has been fed upon 




milk, the meat being tender and very nourishing for 
children, convalescents and old feeble people. 

Roasted or broiled are the most natural preparations. 
The preparation of mutton is the same as for lamb, 
and it is eaten rare, but lamb is eaten well cooked. 
Following are 200 recipes for lamb and mutton, 

NOTE — For all preparations, see "Filet" and "Mignon" 
in pages concerning Beef. Nearly all of the garnishings 

— 212 — 



LAMB 

are the same, so it is not necessary to repeat them. 
These garnishings can be served with crustades and 
tartelettes; the large garnishings can be used for the 
saddle, racks and legs. The garnishings of potatoes is 
the same. 

See names of "Cuts of Meats."

PORK 



PORK (Pore) 

As there are so many different styles of preparing 
povK it is far better to go to a first-class pork butcher, 
than to prepare it one's self, and get your choice such 
as Chitterling sausages, blood pudding, ham and pigs 
feet, flat sausage, smoked or dried sausages and head 
cheese. Without pork we would have no lard and con- 
sequently no cooking. Lard is just as indispensable as 
butter in the kitchen. 




NOTE— See article "Beef" for the time of cooking, 
which is about the same as big meats. See also the 
manner of the cutting of the meats.

HASH AND EMINCE 

(Hachis et Eminces) 

Hash is an aliment made of meat, chicken, game, fish 
or vegetables. It is indigestible, but when well seasoned 
and well prepared makes a good dish. Meat, chicken, 
game, fish and vegetables should be cut in small dice 
and thickened with the sauces that correspond with 
the meats. If the meats are dark thicken with sauce 

— 230 — 



PORK 

Espagnole, tomatoes or juice. The potatoes are optional. 
If the meats are white thicken with sauce Allemande, 
Veloute, Bechamel or Cream. 

The Eminces of meats are prepared in the same 
manner. The only difference is that they are cut in 
thin slices instead of cut in dice and the sauces 
are not so thick. All of the fat must be cut €ut of 
the meat. Raw meat is sometimes used and is mostly 
the sautees. Nevertheless one has the advantage of 
being served quickly when one is in a hurry.

COLD MEAT 



COLD MEAT (Le Froid) 

The dressing of cold meats constitutes high culinary 
art. They can be served on a pedestal, garnished with 
flowers made of wax or vegetables or of golden color 
jelly, which gives a certain elegance to a dinner. The 
dressing of cold meats should be precise and made to 
look very appetizing. There are a great many different

styles of dressing and consequently I will only give 
a few details here. 

Small articles can be dressed upon pieces of buttered 
bread, chopped parsley, coral, chopped eggs or truffles;

KIDNEYS— Rognons 

All kidneys of quadrupeds are edible. Pig, veal and 
Iamb are preferred. Veal kidneys include the meat 
surrounding them. The gravy of kidneys should never 
be cooked in the same sauce pan where the kidneys 
have been fried. Kidneys contain the taste of "sui gen- 
eris"; they should be drained, then fried and put into 
the gravy which should be prepared in advance. Veal 
kidneys can be prepared this way, by cutting them care- 
fully and taking out the center nerve which is always 
impregnated with alkali.

GANCEL'S CULINARY ENCYCLOPEDIA 



POULTRY (Volaille) 

Poultry is the generic and collective term applied to 
all domestic fowl such as: chicken, duck, geese, 
pigeons and guinea fowls. Poultry that has special 
nourishment for fattening purposes are called: pullets, 
capons, spring and squab chickens, also Hambourg 
chickens. 

There are a great many different culinary prepa- 
rations, but the simple way is the best, roast, saute or 
grilled. Chickens or pullets to be braised or poached 
should be singed, emptied and breast bone taken out, 
trussed, covered with larding pork, moistened with 
gravy or divers wines. When they are to be poached, 
rub with lemon and poach in white stock. The stock 
after used for braising should be added to the sauce 
and garniture. Chickens that are to be larded should 
first be lightly poached. 

Chickens to be saute should be singed, emptied, car- 
ved, saute in oil or butter, drained, moistened with 
gravy or wine. Do not cook more than five minutes.

DUCK AND DUCKLINGS 
Canards et Cannetons) 

The domestic duck is most used in alimentation. The 
Rouen duck is world renowned. There are over 40 dif- 
ferent varietites of wild ducks. (See game for prepara- 
tion). The wild duck is of medium digestion, a little 
heating perhaps, but can be modified by its culinary 
preparation. The patties of Amiens, tureen of Nerac, 
and Toulouse are made of duck's liver. Choose only 
young ducks, or ducklings from 6 weeks to 6 months. 

The Rouennaise smother the ducks, so the blood will 
stay inside, they are then roasted and eaten rare. The 
Nantaise eat them well cooked, braised or roasted.

VEGETABLES 



(Legumes) 



Fresh vegetables constitute a large part in culinary 
art as there is always a new method of preparing them. 
The preparation of the same vegetable changes each 
month, according to its age and how tender it is. One 
should know immediately upon looking at green peas 
the time required in co-oking. Each vegetable has its 
own particular proprieties, either fresh or diT- All 
green vegetables should be cooked in boiling water and 
salt, and kept boiling continually. If green vegetables 
are not eaten immediately put in a basin of cold water 
and keep refreshing them to prevent turning yellow or 
black. Dried vegetables should be put in soak the night 
before and then cooked in. cold water. Boil slowly. 
Vegetables w^hich turn black such as artichokes, car- 
doons and oyster plants should be sprinkled with lemon 
juice or put in a bowl of water with lemon juice.

VEGETABLES 



Science claims that vegetables contain phosphorous and 
consequently have great influence in alimentation. The 
artichoke is good for the livers, beeets for the brain: 
celery, lettuce and leeks are remarkably known for 
their properties. Carrots and cucumbers give a nice 
complexion, cabbage enriches the blood, potatoes make 
the hair grow. The Irish and French Bretons are un- 
iversally known for their beautiful hair. Vegetables 
may be eaten freely with good results. Rice, beans 
and peas contain a great amount of nutrition and make 
good blood, and should not be adlowed to fall in disuse. 

Daniel of old fared well and looked fair on lentils. 
Potatoes deserve all the practical estimation in which 
they are held. Through not very nutritious, on this 
account they prevent our taking excessive nutrition in 
other forms. Baked potatoes are fine and palatable, 
however prepared. Potato starch pudding is one of 
the most nutritious and easily digested articles of diet 
to be found. Onions are palatable and wholesome. The 
French consume them freely. They are especially good 
in colds. The ourang outang, when suffering from a 
cold eats onions raw, in great quantities. They are 
aperient and their syrup, sv/eetened, relieves oppressed 
lungs and restores suppressed respiration. 

For incipient infantile colds it is admirable. Cabbage 
digests with difficulty and yields little nourishment. 
Squash and pumpkins are good, either stewed or eaten 
as sauce, or with bread, or made into pies. Cucumbers, 
radishes and immature esculents are especially inju- 
rious. To children they often prove fatal. Green corn 
is also pernicious. In fact w^ait till all green vegetables 
get their growth and virtue. Vegetables furnish all the 
nutritious elements required in the vital process. j

and furnish husks which if picked before ripe are called 
string beans, but these are only a few specimens 
amongst the large variety which can be eaten as string

some and light. The dry beans contain a certain 
amount of azote which is nourishnig. There are three 
differents methods of conserving these beans green, 
namely: The Appert System, dessication, and salted. 
(S'ee different recipes). The Appert System is the best 
if the manufacturer does not put in sulphate of copper 
to preserve the green color. String beans are employed 
very considerably in the kitchen: Soups,, jardinieres, 
macedoines, salades and numerous garnishings are 
made.

land they are boiled and seasoned with cream sauce or 
butter. The Russians make soup. In Germany they 
are torrified and take the place of chicory. In certain 
countries a mild wine is made. The leaves of the beet 
are prepared the same as spinach. The best way is 
to bake, pickle, braise or in cream w. gravy, or in salad.

Sweet fennel of Florence is called "finocchicdolee" and

constitutes a vegetable which is very much appreciated 
for garnishing of meats. It is regrettable that the 
tuberous fennel is so scarce in the market. Delicate

with lemon juice or citric acid. Thicken with butter 
or cream, sauce Hollandaise, surrounded with poached 
eggs, or as garnishings. 

JERUSALEM ARTICHOKES (Topinambour) 

The Jerusalem Artichoke will never become a rival of 
the potato. It has a waterly taste and has the flavor 
of the helianti artichoke and turnip. It is generally 
baked, sometimes it is boiled with cream, fried, in soup, 
puree or omelette, 

LEEKS (Poireaux) 

Leeks are employed generally as seasoning for soups

white sauce. NOTE. — Never put leeks in soup that have 
not been fried in butter first.

Ever since Esau sold his birthright for a plate of 
lentils, this vegetable has always been renowned. The 
Revalesciere, which is nothing but lentil flour, is sold

contaius a lapge amount of azote. It is prepared the

LETTUCE (Laitues) 

All different varieties of lettuce are wholesome, espe- 
cially when cooked, they are digested easily, are re- 
freshing and a little laxative. There are many diffe- 
rent culinary preparations. Take off all of the outside 
leaves until you reach the white part. The epicure eats 
lettuce without being washed as it is more crisp, but 
it has to be washed to take the sand out. Different 
salads are made with lettuce. Pick out firm and full 
ones. 

Every person who wishes to keep healthy should eat 
lettuce, either in salads or garnishings. The green 
leaves are prepared the same as spinach, and should be 
cooked well.

only five that are comestible; such as cepes, chant- 
relies, morils, giroUe and agaric. The cultivated mush- 
room is mostly used in cooking, and can be conserved 
or eaten fresh. There is only one method known to 
guarantee against mushroom-poisoning and that is to 
soak them in salt water diluted with vinegar, half quart 
water, and half pound of mushrooms. Take out of 
water and refresh in cold water. To avoid accidents, 
use only cultivated mushrooms. The preparation of 
mushrooms are very simple and has few formulas, but 
there are many different preparations for garnishings.

Common nettle is used as a purgatif. The young

nettle and extracting the juice, which is applied some- 
times in cases of hemorrhage. 

ONIONS (Oignons) 

Onions are a most indispensable article in culinary 
preparations, and are used in most all sauces; chopped, 
glazed, fried and puree are used for garnishings. The 
onion leaves a disagreable odor on the breath when 
eaten raw, therefore it is necessary to cook them well. 
The mashed pulp of onions made into a plaster, will 
bring a boil or felow to a head quickly. An excellent 
old fashioned cough medecine is made; slice the onions, 
put in an earthen tureen, cover with sugar, let stand, 
then take a tablespoon of the syrop every hour. Always

are the best. Green peas are used in a multitude of 
culinary combinations, which I cannot enumerate here, 

REMARKS: — I never refresh green peas. Let them

methods of preparing potatoes and all of the others 
are their derivatives. Baked or fried, boiled or steam- 
ed. The less water a potato has the better. The fari- 
naceous potato is the most nourishing, and should be 
ripe and well cocked. As an aliment it is of medium 
value, but it contributes largely to function the respi- 
ratory organs. Following are 150 different styles of 
their preparation. Yam is the name of the sweet po- 
tato. A few of these recipes can be applied to the 
sweet potato, but without salt or pepper. — Abbrevia-

RICE 



RICE (Riz) 



Rice should never be cooked to form a paste. 

The Japanese and Chinese cook rice, so that 
each grain stands alone. The best rice is the 
"Caroline, Patna and Piemont", Rice is used in a 
great many different culinary preparations, such as: 
soup, stew or pilaw, risotto, croquettes, also with 
milk, cream or in puddings. As rice contains very 
little azote, a great deal of butter must be used or 
juice of meat. The essential quality of rice is in its 
choleric properties. Rice can be added to all risottos, 
chicken, fish or game. The risotto is most used in 
the kitchen. The juice of lemon in cooking renders 
the rice more firm. 

Rice for Risotto, use first quality.

SALAD (La Salade) 

Salad to be refreshing should be seasoned with good 
wine vinegar, and olive oil. Sometimes the oil is re- 
placed by cream or fried scrap pork, the vinegar can 
be replaced by lemon juice. Salads should only be 
seasoned before serving; that is the general rule. But 
there are certain salads that must be left standing in 
a strong condiment. Any abuse of vinegar is injurious 
to the stomach.

FARINACEOUS FOODS 

The Eastern nations live almost wholly on rice and 
the Scotch on oatmeal. The former countains a greater 
proportion of nourishment than any other article of 
diet, and the virtue of ^ the latter is attested by the 
powerful frames and strong Highlanders. Fortunately, 
oatmeal is coming into general use amongst us, and 
I hail and would promote its production. As a diet for 
children, when eaten with milk, has no superior, if

equal. The dietetic virtue of rye is not generally ap- 
preciated. Nubolted rye flour, made into hasty pudding 
is one of the most easily digested things which dyspec- 
tics can eat. It is also very palatable. 

Rye bread is nutritious, opening, and but for its color 
would undoubtely rival wheat. Barley bread was once 
a staple article of diet. The distillery should no longer 
be allowed to consume such an excellent article of 
food. 

All hot cakes are made with baking powder. Mix 
flour, eggs, milk, salt, sugar and butter according to 
quantity one desires. Buckwheat, cornmeal, rice ana 
wheat cakes are cooked on a hot iron plate, turn over. 
Serve with syrup, butter or honey. (See bread article.)

BREAD (Pain) 

Bread is one of the necessities of life and therefore 
it is necessary to know how to make well. 

Bread making is an operation divided in the prepara- 
tion of the stock yeast, the ferment, the sponge, the 
dough, the moulding and the baking. In using com- 
pressed yeast it saves time and labor. The manipu- 

— 375 — 



CANCEL'S CULINARY ENCYCLOPEDIA 

lation is divided in only the sponge, the dough, the 
moulding and the baking. The exact quantity of flour 
and liquids to be used is very difficult to state, as the 
variety of flours in the different parts of the country 
demand the judgment of the necessary quantity, espe- 
cially the straight dough. The usual heat of the liquid 
must be lukewarm about 70 to 75 degrees Far. The 
flour should be kept in a warm dry place and also have 
the same temperature. In summer the straight dough 
may be fixed with ice water instead of warm, as fer- 
mentation sets in some time after, the flour will be- 
come whiter, being longer in the dough state. The 
oven is the final and most important operation ii^ bread 
making, and may spoil the best of labor through care- 
lessness. It is important to know ho^v to heat an oven 
and ascertain the right heat required for the different 
kinds of bread and rolls as Ihey dj^jand various kinds 
of breads and rolls as they demand various kinds of 
temperature. 

The rule for baking is to have all the broad and 
rolls which require the most heat ready first, and 
followed up with the goods which demand a lesser 
heat. 

HOW TO MAKE STOCK YEAST 

Boil five quarts of water, puL five ounces of flour in 
a jar and make it into a firm paste with a part of the 
boiling water. To the remainder of the water add an 
ounce of hops, boil for ten minutes, remove from the 
fire and run through a fine sieve into the jar and ovet 
the paste. Set in a cool place until liquid is lukewarm. 
Dissolve the paste with the water and add four ounces 
of malt; cover and leave in a warm temperature for 
48 hours without disturbing. After expiration of this 
time strain this liquid in another jar. The stock yeast 
is then ready for use. 

COMPRESSED YEAST 

Compressed yeast being more uniform and reliable, 
is preferred by most of the bakers, and in places where 
only small quantities of bread is made, it is more re- 

— 376 — 



PASTE AND FARINACEOUS 



liable, stronger and quicker than stock yeast, and fer- 
ment; is not quickly affected by change of weather. 
Furthermore it saves time and labor. 

NOTE. — Compressed yeast must be fresh. 

FERMENT 

Wash 7 quarts of small potatoes very clean; place in 
an enameled earthen iron pot, cover with sufficient 
cold water; put on fire and let come to a boil; pour 
water off and refresh with clean hot water and boil 
until well done, throw the potatoes in a large tub and 
add 21/^ lbs. of flour, mash well, to reduce to a smooth 
paste. Dilute this paste gradually with 24 quarts of 
cold or lukewarm water, observing temperature and 
season. Add 5 quarts of yeast and mix all well to- 
gether. Set the tube in a moderately warm place ana 
cover well with a cloth. Do not disturb until fermen- 
tation takes place, which means when risen to the dou- 
ble of its height and falls again. Fermentation should 
take place in from 7 tO' 8 hours. 

NOTE. — This quantity is sufficient for one barrel 
of flour. Use quantity you desire making bread. 

SPONGE 

Bread is made either by setting sponge and making 
dough afterwards or by making a straight dough. In 
making a large dough you are enable to make various 
kinds of doughs out of it and also save yeast. In setting 
sponge dissolve the yeast well in the water and mix 
it with enough flour to make a soft dough. By using 
more or less yeast or colder or warmer water or 
making a softer or firmer sponge in mixing more or 
less flour into it, the time of getting the sponge ready 
can be regulated. When sponge is ready, mix, dust 
over with flour, cover well and let rise. Sponge should 
be ready in 4 hours and is ready when bubbles begin 
to show, which burst and throws off gas, the sponge 
flattens and drops in center. Different doughs can be 
made in taking certain quantities of it, and in adding 
the necessary ingredients for the different desired 

— 377 — 



GAN GEL'S CULINARY ENGYGLOPEDIA 

doughs, as rolls, breads, coffee cakes, etc. Sponge 
can be set cold at night and made into dough in the 
morning, or can be set warm and slack with additional 
yeast to be taken after one hour's time. Straight dough 
is made in the mixing of all ingredients at the same 
time, the use of more yeast is required than for sponge. 
Dough, according to temperature, by using more or less 
yeast may be gotten ready in a few hours or be 
worked in the morning. Dough should be well mixeo 
and kneaded; after it has risen it should be worked 
over several times at different intervals. 

DOUGH 

Made of soft flour requires a firmer dough than when 
made of stronger flour, because it slackens after a 
short time. The age of the dough depends on the 
strength of the flour, and its firmness. Bread and 
rolls should be made up first, as it demands a young 
dough. 

DIVERS BREADS 
French Bread made with Ferment 

Set a medium sponge with 4 qt. of ferment 75 deg. 
Part to be ready in 3 hours. When ready to drop add 
1 gallon of water 75 deg. and 6 ounces salt. Make a 
slack dough and beat it well, let rest for 1 hour. Divide 
up in iy2 lbs. pieces, mould round and put in slightly 
floured boxes. Flatten them down to one third of their 
thickness and dust over w. flour, cover w. another box 
air tight, let rise for about 20 to 25 minutes, mould 
them in long loaves. Set the loaves in cloth lined 
boxes dusted w. flour and raise the cloth between each 
loaf to serve as support, so the dough in rising cannot 
flatten out. When set transfer to peel, wash over w. 
water and make 4 or 5 slanting cuts w. a very sharp 
knive. Put into oven, beke 15 minutes. When baked, 
wash again w. water. 

French split loaves 

Use a little firmer dough than ferment. Make them 
up in the form as long Vienna shaped loaves and set 

— 378 — 



PASTE AND FARINACEOUS 



them on boards. When they are moulded and slightly 
set, brush the top w. lard and press each loaf length- 
wise in the center w. a long thin rolling pin, like split 
rolls. Arrange the loaves, split side down in cloth 
lined boxed, raise the cloth between each for support 
and let rise. Sprinkle peel w. a little white corn meal, 
turn split side up on a small board and transfer to 
peel and bake without washing. 

Dough made with milk 

Different breads are made of part milk, others of 
all milk. When using only milk, make a straight dough. 
The milk must be heated to boiling point and cooled 
off to temperature required to season. When using 
milk and water set the sponge w. the water and add 
the milk when making the dough. When making 
straight dough, bring the milk to a boil and add water, 
let cool down to desired temperature about 75 deg. All 
milk bread takes more color while baking and there- 
fore demands a lower heat, also less time to rise. 

Home made bread 

Make a medium straight dough from 1 gall, water, 
1/^ gall. milk. Heat the milk to boiling point and add 
the water, cook down to 75 deg. Dissolve 4 ounces 
yeast in this liquid and 31/^ ounces of salt, 4 ounces 
sugar and 2 ounces of butter or lard. Mix all ingre- 
dients up well with the water and milk, make the 
dough with a good wheat flour. Let set, dough should 
be ready in two hours when raised to the double of 
its original size, fold it over from all four sides and 
press down. Let raise again for about three quarters 
of an hour, fold over again, divide into pieces, mould 
round and put in boxes, set for about 20 minutes, and 
make them into loaves, pressing two opposite sides 
together with the palms of the hands. Lay in the 
moulds, smooth side up and set to rise until the pan 
is almost full. Bake and brush over with a wash of 
white eggs and water well beaten together. Mold 
should be only half full. From the same dough when 
made in a larger quantity, you can make Vienna loaves

of 2 lbs. of dough each. Sandwich loaves in single 
loaves or made up in American loaf style. (Same bread 
w. water.) Use 1 gall, water 75 deg., 3 ounces sugar, 
3 ounces butter or lard, 3 ounces of salt. This dough 
should be ready raised 4 hours or it will flatten out 
and lose its resistance. Must be worked well and rise 
again for 20 minutes (Same Bread w. Ferment.) Make 
a straight dough with 3 qts. ferment, 1 qt. of water or 
milk, 5 ounces of salt, 80 deg. Work the dough well 
and pen it close up in the trough, let come up and work 
over, let raise about half. Throw the dough on the 
table, divide, mould around, put in the box and after 
it sets for 10 minutes, form in loaves. Bake good 
heat. 

Graham Bread 

Make a medium straight dough of 1 gall, water, 
5 ounces yeast, 4 ounces salt, 3 ounces lard, and 1 pint 
molasses. Mix these ingredients well; add 4 lbs. of 
graham flour and the rest of wheat flour. Let rise 
about two hours and work it down again. Throw on a 
table, mould up as other bread in li/^ lbs. loaves, set 
in pans and let rise in the moulds to two thirds of 
their height. Bake in medium hot oven. (S'ame 
bread.) Use 1 gall, water, li^ ounces yeast, 3 ounces 
salt, 4 ounces lard and % pint of molasses, use V2 
graham and ^2 wheat flour. Let come but once, work 
it down and mould, let rise for a few minutes; scale 
and mould into pans, set to size, bake in medium hot 
oven. 

New England Bread 

Make a firm straight dough of 1 gall, water and 
half a can condensed milk 75 deg., 2 ounces of salt 
and 3 ounces sugar. When set, work it down again; 
let rise for 15 minutes, scale and work into loaves, 
bake in moulds in good oven (Same bread.) Make 
20 ounces corn meal, a mush to begin with. Make 
straight dough at 75 deg. from 2 gall, water, 6 ounces 
yeast, 6 ounces salt, 6 ounces sugar, 6 ounces lard and 
the corn meal mush. Mix all ingredients thoroughly 
with the water before adding the flour. Cover and let 

— 380 — 



PASTE AND FARINACEOUS 



rise 4 hours. Work well after this time has elapsed 

and let come up again for about 25 minutes. Mould 

in loaves, let rise two thirds of its height. Bake in 
a good heat. 

Gluten Bread 

Gluten bread can be made of water or partly milk 
and is treated like graham bread. For 6 persons the 
sweetening and shortening is omitted. Make a straight 
dough of 2 qts. of water and 2 qts. of milk, li^ ounces 
of yeast, 3 ounces salt, 6 ounces lard and V2 Pt- mo- 
lasses. Use only gluten flour to make the dough and 
let come up only once. Work down and after a short 
interval, proceed moulding in loaves as usual and 
bake in a medium hot oven. 

Pullman Bread or Sandwiches 

For Pullman bread use any milk dough, which is not 
too stiff. It should be passed several times through 
rollers w^hich are fastened to the bench or table with 
clamps, before moulding into loaves. It is used mostly 
for sandwiches especially in railroad cars. The pans 
in which this bread is baked should be 10 inches long, 
4V2 inches wide and 4 inches high with a sliding cover. 
Give % proof in the pan. close the cover and bake 
in a medium hot oven. Breads baked in covered pans 
have the advantage to retain their moisture longer, 
have a better taste and the crust is very thin. The 
waste will also be minimized when these loaves are 
cut for sandwiches. 

Pulled Bread 

Made of freshly baked milk bread either in pans w. 
sliding cover or in the American loaf style. Take off 
The crust and pull either w. the aid of two forks or 
breaking the loaf in 3 parts and using your hand, long 
strips, they may have any shape, toast on baking sheets 
in a medium oven to a nice brown. Bread must be 
turned once or twice to have a uniform color on all 
sides. When oven is too hot the inside will not be

Very healthy, especially for invalids. 

NOTE. — Open in case shape use for divers culinary 
dishes served in loaf bread, or crust after dry, when

Raisin Bread 

Make a stiff dough of 1 gall, milk, boil the milk 
first and cool down to 75 deg., add 6 ounces yeast, 
4 ounces salt, 12 ounces sugar, 1 lb. butter and 8 eggs. 
Mix all these ingredients well w. the milk, and make 
with a strong flour a straight dough. Cover and let 
rise for two hours. After it has raised double the 
size, work one and the dough. Scale into l^/^ lbs. 
loaves sultana raisins, and li/^ lbs. currants in the 
dough. Scale into l^/^ lb. loaves, let rise for 20 mi- 
nutes, form the loaves and put in pans. Pan should 
be half full. Let prove to % height of the pan and bake 
in medium hot oven. 

Rye Bread 

Make a rather stiff dough of 75 deg. from 1 gall, of 
water, 3 ounces of yeast, and 5 ounces of salt. Use 
fresh rye flour mixed with the same quantity of wheat 
flour. Let come up once, work down and let set about 
10 minutes; divide in 2 lbs. pieces and mould round. 
When all are formed, shape right off in long, round 
pointed loaves, pressing the seam well together. Place 
on boards or in boxes cov. w. cloth, smooth sides 
down, raise cloth for support and let come only one 
third its size. Turn on with corn meal or rye flour, 
dust, peel, wash over with water, give 3 or 4 slanting 
cuts across and bake in a hot oven. Wash again w. 
a thin white white of egg; wash again as soon as 
taken from the oven. 

NOTE. — Also baked in well greased pans which

in small pieces several times over, which lay on top 
of each other. Let set to double its volume, throw 
the dough on the bench and fold over, let come up 
again and press down another time. Divide in IV^ 
ounces pieces; mould round and arrange in flour dusted 
boxes, dusting them over w. flour. After 15 minutes 
you can make up different kinds of Vienna bread,

CHEESE — Imported and domestic (Fromage) 
There are so many different kinds of cheese that it 
is impossible to name them here, therefore I will only 
write the principal ones. 

Cheese is a good aliment, and there is no dinner 
complete without it. Pick out cheese that is ripe, and 
be careful of imitations. France is the first country 
in the world to produce the best cheeses.

SWEET DISHES— FRUITS' 



SWEET DISHES (Entremets) 

"Entremets" is a French term meaning sweet dishes. 
The French kitchen recognizes two kinds of entre- 
mets — entremets de douceur, a course of sweet dishes, 
and entremets de legumes, a course of vegetables serv- 
ed by themselves quite customary in France. The vege- 
tables are now served with meat or game, sweet dishes 
as dessert. Sherbet or punch is served before the roast 
to facilitate the digestion. The "entremets" of fruit is 
served hot or cold. Sauces are composed of cream or 
syrup of fruits, according to the style of the fruit. All 
of the following recipes can be applied to apricots, pine- 
apple, peaches, cherries, pears, apples, strawberries, 
raspberries, bananas, melons. Add flavor according to 
desire. The fruit is placed in a light syrup, and flavor- 
ed with vanilla. Rub all white fruits with lemon juice 
and do not let cook too long. A great many of these 
entremets can be served in the place of ice cream.

Fruits prevent or remove constipation, and often act 
like a charm upon body and mind; and, eaten with 
^ood bread, nothing is equallly palatable or wholesome.

GAN GEL'S GULINARY ENGYCLOPEDIA 

First class fruit and Graham Bread make a delicious 
breakfast, also berries with bread and milk, and good 
apples, baked or raw. Apples keep the entire year, and 
pears of the very best varieties can be kept till the ap- 
pearance of strawberries the next year. Pears and plums 
can be kept the year round as easily as apples, and 
summer fruits by bottling can be kept perfectly fresh 
a year, and by the use of hot houses, f i uit can be 
packed from the trees in winter or spring. We can also 
preserve them and make into jellies. Yet this process, 
besides deteriorating from their flavor, impairs their 
digestibility. Preserves are too rich. Their nutrition 
is too much concentrated. Most kinds of fruits can be 
dried, and thus kept, though this process dries out 
much of its goodness, as well as sweetness. Yet dried 
fruit stewed is far better than none. Stewed apples 
sweetened make an excellent relish with bread. Yet 
after all nothing equals simple bread, and choice fruits, 
if people only knew it, both for health and luxury. 
Green fruit is most pernicious. Nor do we realize how 
many children especially, lose their lives directly or in- 
directly thereby. When it does not kill immediately it 
often deranges the stomach, breeds worms, and induces 
other diseases, which, sooner or later, complete the 
work of death begun by green fruit. Foreign fruits are 
good but indigenous are better. Nature adopts the pro- 
duct of every climate to its dietetic requisitions; and 
hence has made those fruits to flourish best in every 
climate which its inhabitants require. 

Lemonade is healthy and delicious yet this opinion 
is based on experience rather than science.

Tbe Dinner Table 

RECEPTION AND TABLE (Reception et table) 

The host and hostess should be ready to receive then 
guests, one quarter of an hour before the time an- 
nounced. 

Each guest should be received with the same gra- 
cious hospitality. The host and hostees and the per- 
sons invited to receive with them, should introduce 
the guests. A few minutes before dinner an appetizer 
should be served in the drawing room. The host 
should offer his arm to the lady in whose honor the 
dinner is given or to the elder lady of the party. 
The hostees then should take the arm of the gentleman 
in whose honor the dinner is given or to the elder gent- 
leman present. The host should not be seated until 
after all of the guests. The names are written either- 
on a card or upon the menu. The placing of the guests 
at the table require particular attention. The host 
should have at his right and left the two ladies most 
honored, or the two elder ladies present. The hostees 
should proceed in the same manner. The lady and 
gentleman should be seated alternately. There are no

RECEPTION AND TABLE 



absolute rules as to the luxury of the service as it 
depends upon circumstances. The host and hostees 
should do every thing to make their guests feel at 
home, and above all show a great deal of tact. 



THE SERVICE (Le Service) 

After the soup, serve a glass of wine, white bein^ 
preferable (See Service for dinner wines), but this la. 
not "de rigueur". In pouring wine do not fill to the 
top of the glass. Change the knife, fork and spoou 
after each dish. The host or hostees should pay atten- 
tion and see that the guests are served a second time 
if so desired. When the dinner is finished, the host 
should arise and conduct his guests to the reception 
room, where coffee and liquors are served. 



ETIQUETTE AT THE TABLE 

(La maniere de se tenir a table) 

No matter what form of invitation you receive, be 
very exact. Do not keep the host waiting, as it is a 
breach of etiquette. Always arrive one quarter of an 
hour before the time your invitation calls for. After 
being seated, put the napkin on your lap and do not 
make any noise when eating soup. When the soup Is 
finished, leave the spoon in the plate. Shrimps and 
cracked cold lobster are eaten with the fingers. The 
fork is held in the left hand, the thumb turned down 
and the first finger on the back. The knife is held in 
the right hand and should never be raised to tht» 
mouth. The bread should be placed at the left and 
broken with the fingers. Never refuse to take any 
dish offered you, as it might offend the host or hostess. 
Never ask to be served a second time the same 
thing or plass your plate again. Do not put your 
elbows upon the table. Never lift jour glass when you

CANCEL'S CULINARY ENCYCLOPEDIA 

are being served with wine, and never empty it during 
the meal. Fruits should be cut with a knife, assorted 
cakes to be eaten with the fingers. Ice cream should 
be eaten with a small spoon, and never touch the teeth.. 
Never offer any of the invited guests any fruit that has 
been cut. Do not get up from the table until after the 
host or hostess have arisen. The guests are then con- 
ducted to the drawing room where coffee and liquor are 
served. It wold be very impolite to leave immediately 
after the dinner, but, in case of necessity, the host can 
be notified in advance. The guests may offer the 
hostess flowers. 



SERVICE OF WINE 

(Service des vins dans le diner) 

The head waiter, or the person who has charge af the 
wines, should inform the waiters and specify the diffe- 
rent wines which are to be served at each course. It is 
very important to serve wines in a decanter and to have 
ready the marked ones on the menu. Every wine should 
be served at its temperature. 



TEMPERATURE OF WINES 

(Temperature des vins) 

Madeira, SheriT, Xeres; serve cold. 

Bordeaux: 52 to 56 deg. farh. ; or temperature of room. 

Burgundy: 42 to 46 degrees Farh. 

Champagne: Cold or frappe. 

Dessert. Wine cooled. 

Aperitif, cold, mix ice with the spoon only.

BUFFET AND REFRESHMENTS 

Particular attention should be paid to the alimenta- 
tion and drinks for the buffet. One should serve lighi 
dishes and light drinks, hot drinks being preferable. 
Champagne is the most stimulating and less intoxi- 
cating, of course when there is no abuse. There is 
certainly a long nomenclature of aliments and drinks 
to be served for the buffet but the richness and variety 
depend upon the circumstances of the host or hostess.

COFFEE (Cafe) 

There are as many different styls of coffee pots as 
there are methods of making the coffee. But the best 
coffee Is made by the "French drip method" In an 
earthen or porcelaine pot. (Filtered coffee.). 

The metal coffee pot does not come up to require- 
ments as a ustensil for making good coffee, as it ac« 
quires the taste of the metal. It is quite impossible to 
remove the stains from the walls of the metal coffee

GAN GEL'S CULINARY ENCYCLOPEDIA 



ustensil, and how much truer it must be of the valve 
and tube of the perculator. 

The action of the coffee is directed to the nervous 
system and when swallowed produces a warm cordial 
impression on the stomach, quickly followed by an 
agreable nervous excitement, which extends itself to the 
cerebral functions, givinng rise to increased vigor of 
imagination and intellect, without any subsequent con- 
fusion or stupor, such as charactrizes the action o*, 
narcotic medicines. One of the most extraordinary 
effects is a disposition to wakefulness, which continues 
for several hours after it is taken. It also moderately 
e cites the circulatory system and stimulates the di- 
gestive functions. One can use the amount of coffee 
desired, as some people like it strong and others weak. 
It depends also according to the quality and if freshly 
ground. Following are 2 mixtures of coffee.. 1. — Mix 
equal portions or Porto Rico,, Pranger and Salem. 2. — 
Mix equal parts of Porto-Rico Wynard and Gonaive-. 
The result is delicious. The quatity of coffee for 2 
quarts of coffee is 6 ounces or more according to the 
quality. 

TURKISH COFFE (Cafe a la Turque) 

Grind coffee very fine like powder. Put in a special 
Turkish coffee pot. Mix the amount of coffee desired 
w. sugar and cold water. Stir all together, put on fire 
and let come to a boiling point, take off and tap a few 
times on the stove, to let the sediment go to the bottom, 
put on fire a second time and let boil until it becomes 
frothy and bubbles. Serve in small porcelaine, silver, 
or gold cups. (These cups are a little larger than 
a thimble.) The Turks always order coffee "caim.akcli", 
which means frothy. 

DEVIL COFFEE (Cafe du Diable) 

Use special service. Put in bowl 1 rind of orango 
and lemon, few coffee beans, 2 cloves, Yz stick of cin-

POUSSE CAFE 

Composed in liquor glass, 4 liquors not to be mixed- 
Ceram of mint, fine champagne brandy, chartreuse and 
cream of cacao. 

THE CELLAR (La Cave) 

The cellar should be exposed to the north and be 
cold and dry. The sun should never penetrate through 
the air holes, and in very hot and cold weather the 
holes should be closed to prevent immediate action 
in change of temperature. The temperature of the 
wine cellar should be from 10 to 12 degrees centigrade 
above zero, or 56 degrees Fahrenheit. If it is 
too dry, it evaporates the wines. In a good cellar 
an ordinary barrel will absorb 2 or 3 glasses of liquid 
each month, otherwise if the cellar is too dry it will 
absorb 1 quart. The temperature should not vary more 
than 2 or 3 degrees, for the extreme cold or heat will 
destroy the quality of the wine. The bottles should be 
placed in boxes and laid down flat so that the wine 
will touch the cork. The bottles should be put in 
order, to keep from breaking. Look at each

GANCEL'S CULINARY ENCYCLOPEDIA 

bottle and see if the wine is in good condition and 
if it is not clear let stand for 24 hours until all of the 
deposit goes to the bottom, or put it in a decanter. 
Young wines of good quality get old and obtain a cer- 
tain "bouquet" when kept in a cellar of moderate tem- 
perature, but not too long a time. Champagne, Rhine 
wine and Moselle should be kept in cool cellars. See 
that each bottle is well corked. 

TO DECANT WINES (Les Vins Decantes) 

The decanting of wines consists in pouring it ouv 
slowly, the bottle should be slightly inclined, so as 
not to disturb the deposit which proves the good quality. 
The transparent color of the wine contributes 
largely to the pleasure in drinking it. At dinner the 
wine is generally put in decanters of cut glass.. An- 
other easy way is to put the bottle in a small basket, 
which is held by two rings, then pour out slowly. But 
it is necessary in this manner to place the bottjes 
several hours before dinner time, when the wine has 
sufficiently reposed. 

CHAMPAGNE (Le Champagne) 

The manner of uncorking champagne is very easy 
these days. After taking of the wire, the cork should 
be taken of slowly and without any noise. The cham- 
pagne glass should be very near when pouring it so 
none will be wasted. Pour out slov/ly on the side of the 
glass so it will stop effervesing and the glass is filled 
without any loss. No glass should ever be filled to 
the top with any kind of wine. Champagne of the best 
quality should be put on ice twenty minutes. Wines 
lose their quality when kept on the ice too long. 

HOW TO CHILL CHAMPAGNE 
(Maniere de trapper le Champagne) 
To chill Champagne use rock salt and pounded ice. 
Put bottle in a cooler made of silver, or galvanized 
zinc, fill with rock salt and ice up to the neck, stirring 
continually the mixture right and left. 12 to 15 minutes 
are sufficient to chill the Champagne. To keep it cool

MISCELLANEOUS RECIPES 



put in salt and ice 20 to 30 minutes before serving. 
When one is very much in a hurry put the cooler, al- 
ready prepared, on the fire and turn; in five minutes 
The Champagne is chilled. 

CLARIFYING OF WINE 
(Collage et Clarification du Vin) 

Very often wines are not clear and must be clarified. 
The best substances for clarifying wines are: Fresh 
whites of eggs beaten with a little salt, blood of beef 
freshly killed, cool with salt, and the wine which is to 
be clarified, or fish gelatine. No matter what the clari- 
fication is, proceed in the same manner; melt the subs- 
tance, mix with the wine and pour into the hole of 
the barrel, take a long split stick, stir very well, and 
let repose 15 days. 

MISCELLANEOUS RECIPES

have an agreable penetrating odor- Aromatics, no

SEASONING (Assaisonnements) 

All cooking should be well seasoned. No dish will 
have any taste if it is not savoured well. That is to 
say — the precise style of condimente, which is necessary 
for each aliment. 

SPICES (Condiments) 

Spices are used as seasoning for mixed aliments, 
aromatics, for sweetening, for slightly sour, for salted 
articles: Spices are the most precious culinary article.

of the heat by the smoke. At 210 degrees Fahrenheit 
the smoke is claudy and light, but becomes blue when 
it attains the maximum degree.

HOW TO CARVE (Decoupage) 

Successful carving requires good tools, skill and a 
knowledge of how to carve. Skill depends upon the 
individual, the good tools are these: 
1 sharp-bladed knife, 
1 fork, two or three pronged, 

1 pair carving scissors (used only in the kitchen), 

2 serving spoons, one with a long handle for reaching 
stuffings. 

How to carve, here are a few points usually observed: 
(1) Meat to be carved should be conveniently near 
tho person carving it. (2) It should be placed on a 
dish sufficiently large so the dish will not have to be 
moved. The carving dish should be sufficiently deep, 
so the meat will not slip in it. (3) Beef, veal, lamb, 
pork, ham and mutton are sliced thin as a general rule.

MISCELLANEOUS RECIPES 



'Ribs or beef or sirloin". Cut each slice through to 
the bone. Loosen each slice at the bone with the point 
of the knife, make the slice thin or thick, remove super- 
fluous fat. "Loin and ruak". Begin carving at the best 
end, cutting a complete chop for each person served. 
If the loin is large and each portion of the vertebrae 
too thick have the vertebrae sawed in the kitchen or 
boned so the slices will be thinner. "Leg". Cut the 
leg across the center to the bone. To do this stand the 
leg up. Thinner part uppermost. Serve a portion of 
knuckle with each slice of thick end. "Forequarters". 
Preliminary carving should be done in the kitchen. The 
shoulder should be put on a separate plate. The carver 
will then have a loin and a shoulder or leg to carve. 

"Saddle". Cut English style in lengthwise, slices out 
of the bone. Slice thick. 

"Ham". Cut through straight to the bone, working 
from the center near the thick end. Cut from upper 
side, serving fat and lean evenly. Serve thin circular 

slices. 

"Tongue". Slice from the center working both ways. 
If the tongue is of a large animal do not cut through 
to the bottom part. The bottom and tip are ususally 
chopped and used in cooking. 

"Chicken". Put a fork in the wing and with a knife 
cut it off. In taking off the leg, first slip the knife bet- 
ween the leg and the body and cut, then turn the leg 
back w. the fork and remove it. Later separate the 
first and second points. Slice the breast, remove the 
wishbone, separate the side bones and collor bone so 
the back is left. 

"Turkey". Follow the procedure suggested. Do not 
serve the drumstick or lower part of the leg unless it 
is requested, this being rather hard. Turn the platter 
(or the turkey) and carve the other.

flavor of fish a silver fish slicer or knife should be 
used. Short-grained fish, like salmon, should be cut

JAMS (Confitures) 

Jams are cooked fruits with aromatic condiments and 
should not be mistaken for marmalade or jelly. Mar- 
malade is a puree, jelly is the juice of transparent fruit. 
There are three different kinds of jams — dried jam, 
made with the skin of large fruit, jam of the pulp made 
with the pulp of peeled fruit, and jam of berries, cher- 
ries, grapes, prunes and currants preserved whole with 
the skins. Fruits to be preserved should be picked 
before they are ripe. Fruits bought in stores are used 
for decorations. 

General Rule 

For all fruits add 2 quarts of sugar, for 1 quart of 
cooked fruit juice, modify according to the sweetness 
or the sourness of the fruit by three ounces more or 
less, if the fruits are not preserved with enough sugar 
they turn sour, and if there is too much sugar they 
turn into candy. Keep stirring the bottom of the pot 
well so the fruit will not stick. When they are cooked 
put in glasses or jars covered with paper dipped in 
cognac or cover with paraffine. 

Bar le Due style. White or red currants, remove the 
seeds, cook in honey. Bar le Due is a town in France, 
renowned for currant jam. 

ORANGE MARMALADE

very thin. Add lemon juice, measure the juice and pulp, 
then add an equal quantity of cold water. Let stand

uncovered for 24 hours. Boil uncovered for 1^^ hours; 
let stand again 24 hours. Add an equal quantity of 
sugar and boil till jelly is formed. Turn into hot sterl- 
ized glasses. This makes from 8 to 10 glasses of mild 
clear jelly with the fruit suspended in it. 

(For Sweet Pickled Fruit) 

Pick out fruit that is not too ripe, add % pint good 
vinegar to l^^ pounds sugar, reduced according to fruit. 
Add spices to your taste; cinnamon, cloves, ginger and 
lemon peel. Pears, Peaches, Blackberries, Figs, Straw- 
berries. Cherries, Prunes and Apples can be used. It

MILK (Le Lait) 

Milk is highly nutritious and is adapted to promote 
the growth of children and youth, and the fact that 
nature has ordained it as the natural food for infants, 
is no mean guaranty of its ability. Milk promotes 
sleep and therefore is better for supper, especially for 
children and probably for the wakeful. Sour milk and 
sweetened buttermilk are nutritious and healthy — more 
so than sweet milk, because milk must be curdled be- 
fore it can be digested. 

Some consumptives attribute their recovery to the 
use of buttermilk. Sweet cider added to curdled milk 
makes a delicious and wholesome drink. Scientists 
have been debating a long time to find out in which 
manner milk should be taken, boiled or fresh from 
the co^Y. Some people complain, after drinking milk 
that they are deranged, but that comes from drinking 
too hurriedly. It is necessary to consume a cup 
of milk in five minutes time. Milk is used in the 
culinary department as a basis for cream soups, 
vegetables, sauces, pastry and ice creams. Different 
milk employed in alimentation are : cow, goat, 
mares, ewe and reindeer. Sterilized milk is milk re- 
duced to the consistency of cream by evaporating in 
vacuum and then thoroughly sterilized. 

To keep fresh milk from decomposing put 65 grains 
bicarbonate of soda to one quart of milk. After certain 
preparation of cream and milk, butter and cheese are 
made in every part of the world. The Russian makes 
Kumyss and brandy with mares milk. The Turks make 
their caimak or cream with milk of ewes. 

OIL (Huile) 

Oil replaces butter in certain countries. It is ex- 
tracted from fruits, grain seeds and plants. The best 
oil comes from olives, and the best producing countries 
are Nice, France, California and Lucca, Italy.

PRESERVES (Conserves) 

Different methods of conserving are: The dessication 
of fruits, vegetables and meats, the smoked, dried and 
cooked fruits put in alcohol, the juice of meats and 
fruits, such as loaves and tablets; the jams, marmalades 
and jellies; pickled meat, fish, vegetables and butter. 
Jellies, grease and oils are conserved in vinegar, sugar 
and alcohol, and must be tightly closed so no air can 
penetrate The best method of conserving is the 
Appert system, which is: boiling of the cans or steam- 
ing of the jars. The method of to-day is the refri-

gerator. All articles put in the refrigerator should be 
absolutely fresh. Experts should be named by the 
Board of Health, to inspect all food, to see that it is 
fresh before putting in cold storage. 

Appert System 

Cook or scald the meat, vegetable or fruit, put in a 
bottle well corked and tie with a string. Put in a large 
pot with hot or cold water. Let boil from 10 to 30 
minutes according to the substance. Put straw around 
the bottles in boiling, so they will not crack. 

Preserved eggs (CEufs conserves) 

The perfect conservation of eggs is not yet known. 

The method most employed is: Cooked in lime paraffin, 

silicate of soda, or refrigerator. 

Preserved by Coction, Dip very fresh eggs 2 minutes 
in boiling water, let cool immediately; keep in sand 
in a cool place. 

Preserved in lime water, Quick lime 2 lbs., 30 quarts 
water, put eggs in jar, dissolve lime in water, so that 
all of the eggs are covered over with the solution. 

Preserved in Silicate of Soda, Put eggs in jar, cover 
with solution of silicate of soda and w^ater, let stand 
in solution 10 minutes, then take each egg separately 
and put between two sticks, when dry turn over and 
brush with the solution. Keep on husks of grain. 

Preserved in Refrigerator, latest style. Put boxes In 
cold storage, or break the eggs in a can or in a solu- 
tion of salicylate of soda, or the yellow of eggs dried. 

Preserved Olives, green or ripe. 

Put 6 per cent of wood ashes and equal quantity of 
slack lime, let olives stand 48 hours, change the water 
every 24 hours for 10 days, then in the following pickled 
composition, which is: 12 quarts water, 1 pound coarse 
salt, fennel, bay leaves, coriander; let boil 1 hour, strain. 
Put olives in this composition when it is cold. The 
olives can be eaten after 15 days. Olives put in a jar 
with olive oil and garlic for 3 or 4 days are very 
appetizing.

WATER (L'Eau) 
Iced or cold water taken in summer aids the diges- 
tion, but it is not prudent to drink if one is perspiring. 
Warm water is effervescent and produces vomiting. 
Hot water, with a pinch of salt, a little lemon juice or 
sugar, acts upon the digestive organs and kills the 
germs. But no matter in what form water is taken, 
it must be potable. Water is an efficient promoter of 
normal action, of universal life. Of its wonderful hear- 
ing virtues — of which it contains a large proportion — 
is probably the chief instrumentality.

The most simple and cheap way to conserve potable 
water is to put in a piece of charcoal, according to

THE VALUE AND LAWS OF HEALTH 

THE VALUE AND LAWS 
OF HEALTH 

(La Sante) 
(By the celebrated French Dr. Raspail.) 

Happiness is the constitutional and only legitimate 
product of every organ of the body, every faculty of the 
ni^ind, every element of our being. Pleasure in quaffing, 
luxuriantly the fresh air of heaven and then in expend- 
ing the vitality, thus obtained, is the only natural func- 
tion of respiration. Benevolence was created to bless 
the needy, pour the oil of consolation into the wounded 
soul, avoid causing pain, and adorn human nature, as 
well as to render the giver himself also happy, it being 
still more blessed to give than to receive. 

Value of health 

Therefore exceeds that of anything else because it 
imports the greatest attainable zest and relish to life 
and all its blessing. Nor can we enjoy life, except by 
its instrumentality and in proportion to its vigor. With- 
out it, what can we do or become, or enjoy? When de- 
sease has destroyed appetite, the most delicious fruits 
and food only nauseate; yet how much a keen appetite, 
consequent on excellent health, relishes, them? Well 
might the glutted epicure offer the beggar boy a guinea 
for his morning's appetite. The rich invalid is poor 
beca.use he can not enjoy his possession, yet the healthy 
are therefore rich, because their fund of life and cap- 
abilities of being happy are great. Those who have 
alvt^ays enjoyed health, little realize its uses, or value. 
As we measure time by its loss, so we rarely estimate 
the blessings of health till it declines. Oh. I would give 
my all — all the world if mine — for the repossession of 
that health — life — I have carelessly and wantonly 
squandered, and that without having received any value 

— 451 —

in return for this choicest gift of heaven. Then what 
consuina,te foolishness to trifle with health as almost 
all do now? Esau's folly was wisdom in comparison 
with those who carelessly give away a lifetime of vigor 
for one of feebleness — who even barter life itself for 
some momentary indulgenco. Let then the preservation 
of health be the great concern, the paramount business 
of life, as. it is the perfection of wisdom and the great 
instrumentality of enjoyment. Since health consists in 
the normal and vigorous action of all the physical 
functions, its preservation of course consists in their 
preservation and its restoration in their restoration. 
"Meat gives force and strength." 

Brute force it does, but of this men has relatively 

too much already, as we shall soon show. "Would you 
then," it is farther objected, "have us abstain from 
flesh, and thus become as pusillanimous as the Hin- 
doos?" 

But are the meat eating Indians and Laplanders so 
very forcible? What have they ever accomplished — 
what triumph ever achieved other than with the scalp- 
ing knife and the tomahawk? If meat alone gives force 
one Indian would master two pale faces whereas one 
white man is equal to a score of red ones. The former 
eat less meat, yet, under every disadvantage has driven 
the latter back and back again, farther and still farther 
upon the setting sun, till they bid fair-foul? to exterm- 
inate his race. Admitted that meat gives force, yet 
mark the kind of force it imparts. Analogous to that 
of the tiger and wolf — force to dare and kill rather 
than to do. 

Does the lion accomplish so much more than the 
horse? Or is the wild bull so extra tame and feeble? 
Do not both the strongest and the fleetest of animals 
live upon vegetables? The elephant and rhinoceros 
eat no meat, yet their muscular power a,nd endurance 
far transcend those of the lion and the tiger. The 
deer, antelope and gazelle live on herbage, yet distance 
all flesh-eating animals in the open chase. Since, there- 
fore, the fleetest and the strongest of animals eat no

meat, must man eat it, or be weak or sluggish? Or to 
apply this principle directly to man: Is the Highland 
Scotchman, who was brought up on oatmeal, and tasted 
meat no oftener than the moon quartered, so very in- 
efficient? Are the potato-fed Irish weak? Can our 
own beef-gourmands dig or carry more? Try, you meat 
advocates. The rice-fed Chinese will outdo "John Bull" 
and "Uncle Sam" except in shedding blood. So will 
the herbenious inhabitants of the Pacific Isles. Not 
that animal food does not develop muscular strength. 
Carnivorous animals are strong, but herbiverous ani- 
mals are stronger, yet have less propensity. Hence 
since meat develops propensity, yet it is not necessary 
to either strength or force — since it animalizes and de- 
praves, and thus does a positive damage, but not a 
necessary good — why injure ourselves by consumption? 

HYGIENE, DIET, LONGEVITY 

"Cuisine, c'est la medecine; c'est la mede- 
cine preventive la meilleure" — J. Michelet. 

Dieting consists in abstaining from certain foods, and 
it is very necessary to follow a hygienic diet in certain 
diseases. Every mistress of the house, and also the 
cook should know how, and what to do in an emergency 
case. 

Meat shortens people's lives by decades. I meaa 
that people who wish to live a century, must not eat 
meat — especially the highly proteid meats. The whole 
secret of perpetual youth, is a complete supply of food, 
to all the cells of the body combined, with ridding the 
cells of all waste matter. To accomplish this, you must 
cut out food excess proteids, and cut down cereals., 
including bread, and eat less sodium or common salt. 

Second: eat plenteously of food containing potassium 
salts. You will find them in all kinds of salads. Water 
cress is one of the best elixirs of life. Consume more 
organic acids, which are best obtained from grapes, 
raisins, oranges, apples and citrons. Acids, remove

waste from the arteries, soften them, and reopen the 
blood vessels. Any man showing signs o^ old age, 
should take three months of this diet, and he would 
become young again. Lastly eat garlic and onions, 
the greatest intestinal cell antiseptic in the world, with, 
out being destructive like drugs. (Read each article 
on vegetables.) They will cure the most malignant 
skin and blood diseases known. Two ounces of garlic 
daily is the greatest preventative of old age. 

Another great fault of mankind is, that all drink too 
much. I do not mean alcoholic beverages, but too mucn 
coffee, tea, milk, besides beer, wine and spirits. It is 
not what is drunk, but how much. Too much fluid 
lessens a man's power of resistance. For instance things 
growing wet, develop rapidly and then die. Look at 
the water lily. Things growing in dry places take longer 
to mature, are much healthier, and live longer. Look 
at the oak. The same principles apply to human beings. 
I am not for prohibition — I believe in wine and beer. 
Every man and woman of more than fifty should have 
a glass of wine daily; it dilates the capillaries of the 
body, preventing the closing of the blood vessels. A 
glass of beer daily helps a person after forty. Hard 
drink is wholly bad. I am against alcohol in any form, 
for any one under forty; it is unnecessary. Getting 
intoxicated once a month does not hurt according to 
Raspail, the great French doctor, eating the greatest 
steak once a week does not hurt — but the steady drinker 
and meat eater wears down the body's vitality, fills hla 
cells with waste matter, and hardens the arteries. 
Georges Clemenceau, the "Old Tiger of France", owes 
his wonderful mentality and activity to his diet of 
vegetables and milk, and in going to bed early, and 
arising early. 

So it is very necessary to follow a practical diet, to 
aid or cure certain diseases, in following the se different 
culinary preparations. 

FEVER AND BRONCHITIS (Fievre et Bronchites) 

The general rule for fever and bronchitis is to take 
all aliments in liquid form, rgularly and in small quan^

titles. The patient can be served the following ali- 
ments: Chicken bouillon, beef, mutton or oyster broth. 
The white of an egg beaten and mixed with orange 
juice or lemon, or egg beaten with milk or water. 

DIABETES (Diabtes) 

Until now medical science has not discovered any 
cure for diabetes, and it is only the kitchen diet that 
will aid or cure the patient. One can use the following 
aliments: Raw or cooked oysters in water, all kinds of 
fresh or salted fishes, in oil; all meats with the excep- 
tion of calf's liver, mutton, tripe, ham and sausage. One 
can eat moderately venison or chicken without any 
sauces. Bouillon of beef, mutton, chicken, without any 
flour, rice or any substance containing starch. Vege- 
tables to be used: cabbage, cauliflower, asparagus, 
spinach, mushrooms, tomatoes, lettuce, chicoree, olives 
radishes, cucumbers, onions, turnips and celery. Bread 
and cake in any style should be prepaired with a specia* 
flour gluten soya, without corn or flour. Almonds, nuts, 
oranges, lemons, cherries, strawberries and raspberries, 
these last three should be eaten moderately. Coffee, 
tea and milk can be taken but without any sugar. 
French red wine of first quality can be taken as an 
appetizer or after the meals. Beer is absolutely for- 
bidden. Drink Seltzer water. Spa and Vichy and milk. 

Do not eat these fruits and vegetables: Chestnuts, 
potatoes, rice, beets, carrots, parsnips, dried beans or 
green peas, in fact anything containing starch. 

DYSPEPSIA, DIARRHOEA, GASTRIC, CATARRH, 

ASTHMA (Diarrhee, Dyspepsia, Gastrite, 

Catarrhe, Asthme) 

The treatment of all these diseases depends upon 
hygiene and green vegetables. One can use the follow- 
ing aliments: Soup of beef, chicken, mutton, oysters, 
rice, barley, tapioca and vermicelle. Meat, such as 
boiled calf's brains, sweetbreads, boiled or roasted, beei, 
mutton, chicken boild or roasted without gravy, turkey, 
squabs and other birds cooked in the same manner;

ages, weak tea and coffee. For diarrhoea, eat butter 
in small quantities. Use port wine or cognac in small 
quantiites and at intervals. 

CONSTIPATION, ANEMIE AND LEUCORRHEA 

The greatest attention should be given to the regular- 
ity of the intestinal organs. But as there are so many 
different kinds of constipation, nearly every case has 
a different treatment. To obtain a good result, one 
should not take any medicine, but follow a strict diet. 
For Anemia: wholesome, nourishing food which can be 
digested easily, sunshine and hygienic are the best cures 
for anemic persons. The diet consists of: soups of 
chicken, mutton, oysters, tapioca; meats: beefsteak, 
lamb, roast mutton, brains, boiled sweetbreads, chicken, 
pigeon, turkey roasted or boiled; Fish, oysters., pre- 
paired in any style such as: mackerel, perch, and

GOUT, RHEUMATISM, KIDNEYS AND BLADDER 

(Goutte, Rhumatime, Reins et Vessie) 

These diseases are very painful at times. The chef 
cook and rich peoples are generally the ones that suffer 
from these diseases. All excesses in all pleasures 
should be immediately stopped. Eat plain nourishing

from starchy food and sugar. Soups of meat, rice and 
vermicelle, eat vegetables moderately. Lean meats, 
lamb chops, broiled mutton, chicken roasted or broiled.

any sort, heavy or highly seasoned food, pastry, and 
alcoholic drinks, tea, coffee or any aliment difficult to 
digest. 

SPERMATHOREE, GONORRHEE 

All alcoholic drinks are strictly forbidden for people 
suffering from these diseases. Also abstain from drink- 
ing tea or coffee. Milk is the best drink in these cases. 
Do not eat any fat, or highly seasoned food. The nourish- 
ment should consist of aliments such as: rice, beans, 
bread made of wheat and corn. 

ALIMENTATION FOR CHILD 

The new born baby only nurses and sleeps, and only 
attention is paid to that during the first few months. 
The habits of the child should be regulated early. As 
the child grows older, it should not sleep so much ii* 
the day time, but the sleep at night should be the same. 
As the mother is the principal doctor for her child, 
she should pay attention to its food. Naturally children 
prefer cakes and candies to soup and bread. They 
should be fed regularly and at a certain hour. Never 
give a child any spiced food, nor too much sugar; the 
food should contain more salt than sugar. Children 
shold be taught to use a spoon in the right hand, and 
the fork in left, the bread to be taken in tlie right hand. 
A knife should never be given to a child before the age 
of 6 or 7 years. The mother should pay great attention 

— 458 — 



HYGIENE 



to the physical education of the child, and table hygiene. 
A well bred child or children will always give a good 
deal of pleasure to the parents. The celebrated French 
writer J. J. Rousseau says of children: If a mothei 
wishes to spoil her children, let her give them every- 
thing they ask for, and then it is the mother who will 
suffer afterwards. 

POISONING (Empoisonnement) 

Ptomaine poisoning is caused frequently by mussels, 
oysters, crabs, fish, pork, and ice cream; and very often 
mushrooms. 

First: Take away promptly the poison. 

Second: To take the poison out of the system give 
the patient a vomitif, 130 grains of ipecacuanha in a 
glass of water. For purgatif 1 tablespoonful of magne- 
sia in a glass of water with a little sugar. Give an 
enema, IV4, quarts of warm water and 2 tablspoonsful 
of kitchen salt. If the person does not die immediately 
from poisoning, then life can be saved with this remedy. 
If you have not any of these medecines in the house 
give the patient milk with the white of eggs to drink 
and an anemea with warm water and salt. 

INDIGESTION (Indigestion) 

Indigestion is caused by food not being well prepared, 
but sometimes by having taken cold, or by some great 
moral suffering", m cases of indigestion, take camomille 
tea, flavored with orange water. If this method does 
not stop the indigestion take a vomitif. 

INTOXICATION (Ivresse) 

It is said that to prevent intoxication, take a quarter 
of a glass of pure olive oil or sweet almond oil, be- 
fore eating. The best method of all is to drink moder- 
ately, but sometimes it depends upon the disposition of 
the stomalch, and one glass of champagne might 
intoxicate. Black coffee and a few drops of 
ammonia in Seltzer aids intoxication, as it arouses 
the nervous system. Give the following: water 
4 ounces, essence of peppermint % ounce, liquid am- 
monia 12 drops. Mix, and give every quarter of an

± 

hour, two or three times; or sugar and water with a few 
drops of ammonia, or Bromo Seltzer. 

THE DIGESTION (La Digestion) 

Fortunately for the civilization of today, we have fire 
to cook our food. The advance made in culinary art 
has transformed everything. 

It is to this science that civilization owes its re- 
gulated meals, which is the regime of good digestion. 
Medical science has classified certain aliments, by its 
degree of digestibility, comparing the human body to 
a wheel, which the fonctionment accepts and refuses 
certain matters. Think well ,and you will digest well. 

Necessary time for completing digestion of certain 
aliments. (Temps necessaire pour la digestion complete 
des principaux aliments) :

THE MARKET (Le Marche) 

For the cook or housekeeper, the provisions are the 
fundamental stone of the kitchen. 

The quality of the products depends upon the success 
of excellent cooking. 

Why? Because there is no medecine in good cooking. 
All meats, chicken, large or small game, vegetables, 
fruits, butter for pastry should be fresh and of the finest 
quality. 

There are no four seasons of today, as from the be- 
ginning of the year to the end, all products are to be 
found in the hot house or the refrigerator.

THE MARKET 



How to select provisions at the Market 

POULTRY — Domestic turkeys, chicken, duck, geese, 
etc. are divided into two classes: young and old, the 
young ones are distinguished by their soft feet, soft 
cartilage at the tip of the breast bone, the skin is 
moist, smooth and fine-textured. Spring chicken is best 
to roast, broil or saute, old ones are only boiled or 
^Hbraised. 

Cock turkeys are preferable to hen turkeys. Young 
turkeys have smooth dark legs, pliable breast bone 
f cartilage and are plump. Young turkeys are best roast- 
[ ed or broiled, old ones, boiled or braised. 

Always select plump firm geese, the fat should be 
white and clear. 

As to ducks, the wings should be tender, the fat 
more yellow, and the webbing of medimn texture, not 
rough as in the case of old ducks and geese. 

Young pigeons and squabs have pink legs, and light 
red flesh on the breast, the old ones are dark. Squabs 
are young, tame pigeons are generally raised for market 
purposes. They are as large as old ones, but are cover- 
ed with pin feathers, and in quality resemble young ones. 

GAME — Partridge, quail and grouse have full breasts, 
dark legs and yellow beaks. 

Venison is dark red, with some white fat. 
^ Hare, rabbits and opoossum have smooth sharp 
claws, tender ears and paws, and short necks. 

How to select fish 

The eyes of fresh fish are bright, the gills red, the 
flesh very firm, the scales bright and gleaming, and the 
entire fish life-like. Fresh fish is practically odorless, 
although sea fish always more or less have an odor 
of the sea. 

Fish should be thoroughly cooked, otherwise it Is 
indigestible or poisonous. Therefore always buy fresh 
fish. Unscrupulous dealers dip tainted meats or fish 
in salicylate and then sell it as fresh. Always be 
careful in your buying.

BILL OF FARE (Menus) 

A FEW MODELS OF BILL OF FARE 

It is impossible to arrange exactly any bill of fare 
here, because every hotel or restaurant has its own 
style, according to the business and importance of the 
house- To facilitate the work and render quick service, 
the name of the dish should be written very distinctly 
on the menu or card. My opinion, and also the opinion 
of a good many of my colleagues, is that the kitchen 
of today merits more respect and should be classed 
among the arts, and every care should be taken to 
facilitate the daily task of the cook.
