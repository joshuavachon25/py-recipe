the Sap is become forward, and the Leaves b^ 
gin to appear, the Juice by being long digeftci

The Method of procuring the Juice is cither 
by boring a Hole, or making an Incifion in the

for two or three Days together without hurtii 
the Trees or which is better, it may be

the (^ will fwim above the Liqnor about 
the br^dcb of a Groat, then let it cool. The 
next Mdrning you may barrel it up, putting in 
m Ounce and a quarter of Ginger, better than 
half an Ounce of Cinnamon, of Clores and 
Mace, each an Ounce and a quarter, all grofly 
pounded \ for if it be beat fine, it will always 
float in the Metheglin and make it foul, and if 
the Spices be put in while it is hot, they will 
lofe their Spirits. Put in a fmall Spoonfiil of 
Yeaft at the Bung- hole to augment its working, 
but it mud not be left to (land too cold at firft^ 
for ^hat would hinder its Fermentation. As 
fooiv's^ it has done working, it muft be ftopt 
up clofe, and let ftand for a Month, and then 
foiled off, and if then iet into a Refrigeratory^ 
ic will be a moft pleaiant vinous Liquor, and 
the longer it is kept the better it will be. 

You may judge of its Strength by the float-- 
iog of the Egg, and it may be made ftronger or 
fmaller, at pleafure, by adding more Honey or 
more Water. And the more it is boiled, the 
izK>re pleafant and more durable it will be. 

It is not neceflary to fcum the Metheglin while 
it is boiling, for the Scum being left behind, 
will help its Fermentation, and afterwards ren- 
der it the clearer, it being commonly believed 
that it unites again.

viii The Preface* 

Terfons in thi fever al Brducbes of Heufemfen there freatei

By the Affiflance of this Appendix, a Mtflrefs of a Houfe 9r 
"Houfe^keeper will he enabled to furnifb not only agoodPan* 
try, but a well-ftored Cellar with good Engliih Wines and pot" 
^tle U^uors of our own Growth and Produffion, not inferior to 
ehofe ofFnnce, Spain, or Portugal, inGoodnefrand Agreeable* 
pefs to Engliih Con/itutions, but vafily inferior in Price^ which 
will be always at hand, either to refrep or repair languid 
and exhaufted Spirits s to entertain Friends ; and alfo to 
fiore the Clofet with refrejhing Cordials proper upon any EnuT'* 
genty^ either to preferve Health or to rejlore it. 

Nor are there wanting Cofmeticks for thi belpingt preferving 
And recovering the Complexions of the Fair Sex. For thefir 
and the PhyRcai Receipts we are beholdii^ to the Manufcript of

Jore made publish 

And as to the Phyfical Part^ that will put the Mother of a 
Family into a Capacity to adminijler to tbemfehes^ their ChiU 
dren or their Servants^ labouring under any of the Aches^Pains^ 
Sores f or any of the many Maladies therein mentioned^ which 
eft en happen in a Family y without the Trouble offending orgo* 
ing to Pbyjician^ Apothecary^ or Surgeon^ which to many Fami'" 
iies in the Countries is frequently very troublefome as well 
as chargaabloy by reafonof their great dijlancefrom them. 

And alfo thoje generoufly-difpos^d Gentlewomen that are cha^f 
ritabh difpos^d to be ferviceable to their poor and affliSied 
Neighbour Sy will by the Perufalofthis JSook^ be inflruited how 
to exert their Beneficence^ votthout greatly burdening their 
Purfesy or fatiguing their Perfons. ne Recipe's being gene-- 
neralty fuch as are che^ipy eajily procured^ and as eafily pre*

{which theWijeman faysy is rather to be chofen than precious

their poor affiiHed Neighbours to whom their generous Afftj^

Whoever fiall make ufe of this, will find the Particulars

PRESERVING, ^c. 

To elarify Sugar in order to PK^ferving^ &c. 

TT A K E a Pan convenient as .to fize, according 
to the Quantity of Sugar you would cla- 
rify. Break an Egg or two into fomc Water 
with the Shell, whip them with a Whiik, and 
pour them upon the Sugar that is to be melted. 
Set it on the Fire, flirring it continually, when 
it boils, fcum it carefully i as the Sugar rifes from 
time to time, put in a little cold Water, to pre- 
vent it from boiling over, and to raife the Scum, 
alfo adding the Froth of the White of an Egg 
whipt a-part. When after the Liquor has been 
thoroughly fcum'dj there remains only a fmall 
whitifli Froth, which is not black and foul as 
before i and when the Sugar on the Spatula ap- 
pears very clear, take it off the Fire, and pa(s it 
through a Straining Bag, and it is fufficiehtly 
clarified. ^ " 

There are feveral Degrees of boiling Sugar for 
fcveral Ufts in Confcfbionary, t^c. The Degrees 
of boiling are fix, Smooth^ Pearled^ Blown^ Fea^ 
thered^ Cracked and CarameL Thefe fix Degrees 
are alfo fubdivided with refpeft to their particu- 
lar Qualities, as the lefierand the greater Smooth, 
the lefler and the greater Pearled, Feathered a 
little and a great deal, and fo of the reft.

The Smooth hoiling of Sugar. 

CUGAR has attain'd to this degree of Clari- 
^ fication, when if the tip of the Fore- finger 
be dipt in it, and afterwards applied to the Thumb, 
and opened a little, a fmall Thread or String 
Aicks to both, which immediately breaking a 
Drop will remain upon the Finger. When this 
String is almoft imperceptible, the Sugar has 
only boird, 'till it becomes a little Smooth, and 
when it extends itfelf farther, before it breaks 
it is a Sign that the Sugar is very fmooth. 

The Pearled boiling of Sugar. 

VTTHEN the Sugar has boiled a little longer, 
^^ try the fame Experiment, and if in fcpa- 
fating your Fingers, the String continues (lick- 
ing to both, the Sugar is come to its pearled 
Quality. 

The Blown boiling of Sugar.

^^ fliake the Skimmer a little with your Hand, 
beating the Side of the Pan, and blow the Holes 
of it, from one fide to the other, fo that fmall 
Sparks as it were, or fmall Bubbles, fly out, the 
Sugar has attained to the Degree call'd Blown.

the Egg- will- fwim above the Liquor about

next Morning you may barrel it up, putting iln 
an Ounce and a quarter of Ginger, better than 
half an Ounce of Cinnamon, of Cloves and 
Mace, each an Ounce and a quarter, all grofly 
pounded ^ for if it be beat fine, it will always 
float in the Metheglin and make it foul, and if 
the Spices be put in while it is hot, they will 
lofe their Spirits. Put in a fmall Spoonful of 
Yeaft at the Bung* hole to augment its working, 
but it muft not be left to (land too cold at firft, 
for that would hinder its Fermentation. As 
foon as it has done working, it muft be ftopc 
up clofe, and let (land for a Month, and then 
boiled ofi^ and if then (et inco a Refrigeratory, 
it will be a moft plealant vinous Liquor, and 
the longer it ^is kept the better it will be. 

You may judge of its Strength by the float- 
ing of the Egg, and it may be made ilronger or 
fmaller, at pleafure, by adding more Honey or 
more Water. And the more it is boiled, the 
more pleafant and more durable it will be. 

It is not lieceflary tofcum the Metheglin^while 
it is boiling, for the Scum being left behind, 
will help its Fermentation, and afterwards ren*- 
der it the clearer, it being commonly believed 
that it unites again.
