&fP* HE RECIPES contained in this booklet, are nut in- 

tlL tended for the graduate of culinary art, or the one 
Mho plies domestic science on a scientific principle. 

This little book in its simple and unpretentious way is 
dedicated to the Housewife who is dealing with the per- 
plexities of preparing the meals. 

Its aim is to help the one whose larder is not always 
provisioned with a great variety of fancy groceries, as well 
as, the cue whose training- for this duty is unfortunately 
limited. The author contributes a few recipes that are 
original, but in the main, old recipes written anew, im- 
proved upon and simplified, is all that is claimed herein. 

It is hoped and believed, that this book will be of 
some assistance, and lighten the burden of the one who 
makes the home — the Faithful Household Cook.

A Tribute to the Worlds Heroine 



The li'orld is- always praising 

All the great folk of the time- 
The poets and musicians, and 

The ministers sublime; 
But the earth's greatest heroine 

They never east a look; 
I'll tell you she is, at once — 

The blessed household cook. 



We hear a lot of lauding for 

The man zvho goes to war, 
The artist and the sculptor, 

The poet and his lore, 
I lh lawyer and iuz'cnter, and 

The author's famous book; 
But zee never hear a zeord about 

The blessed household cook. 



Perhaps you think she isn't zvorth 

The praise that I would give; 
But, without her ceaseless kindness 

Tray, how long would you live? 
W e all would soon expire, if 

Of food zee ne'er partook; 
So. / raise my hat in honor of 

The blessed household c,ook. 

She saves the lives of thousands. 

By her duties every day. 
Though she does it in a simple 

. lud unnoticed, quiet way. 
But when I am an author. 

I shall surely write a book 
About the queen of womankind — 

The zeorthy household cook. 

ALICE M. JONES. 
(In Farm and Home).

Bread 



Bread the staff of life, by common consent, occupies first 
place as an article of food, in all homes, by all peoples of the 
•ivilized and much of the uncivilized world. 

Bread dates back before the beginning" of history. 

Tlie scriptures in early Bible times frequently mention 
bread, also unleavened bread of the Jews used in the Passover. 

In Genesis 18:6 we read: "Abraham hastened into the teni. 
into Sarah, and said, "Make ready quickly three measures of 
fine meal, knead it, and bake cakes upon the hearth." 

History tells ns of the ancient Egyptians, who knew the 
art of bread making, of the Greeks and Romans who had many 
bakeries, and bread and cakes Avere made in great variety. 

in the Chaldean ruins well built ovens, and perfect grinding 
stones for reducing grain are found. The earliest bread makers 
were the Lakedwellers that inhabited Switzerland in the Stone- 
age. Loaves baked on hot stones were found. 

Perhaps the earliest record of the grinding of grain and 
bread made from it, comes from China. The Chinese were 
bread makers 4500 years ago. Judging from what we read of 
it the bread question is an old one. 

Leavened bread as far as the leavening is concerned is 
made the same to-day as it was in early times. Fermented or 
sour dough, as it is commonly called, is the leavening used. 

Sour dough is made by taking a small portion of dough 

- say three or four ounces from a baking - and putting it 

away until the next baking day. then mixing it with fresh 

dough. "11 will leaven the whole lump." Bread made in this 

way usually has a sour taste. 

For a long time bread making has been considered an art, 
and it may be added that to make a good wholesome loaf of 



12 BREAD MAKING AND BREAD BAKING 

bread is the greatest of household arts. A baking of nicely 
browned, plum]), loaves of bread, always challenges attention 
and is always admired. Some authorities on domestic ar1 
claim that to be successful in bread making, one must know 
the chemistry of yeast and flour, in fact, bread making in all 
its scientific principles. 

This booklet does not treat on the chemistry of bread mak- 
ing, but on the most simple, practical, successful home methods, 
it is desirable, though not necessary, that one who bakes under- 
stands something about flour as well as yeast. 

It is now nearly three hundred years since yeast was first 
used, and while our ancestors made a good palatable bread it 
was not until recent years that the art of bread making at- 
tained any degree of perfection, this. <d course, is largely made 
possible by the modern method of milling wheat and making 
flour. All brands of patent process flour, made from spring 
wheat, is standard and the best lor bread making. 

By spring wheat is meant, wheat sown in the spring. It is 
chiefly grown in the Northwestern States and Canada. Flour 
•>l this wheat is generally called "Hard Wheat Flour." It i« 
rich in gluten and is the most perfect bread Hour. It is of a 
creamy color, not white or grey in color, which indicates a 
poor flour. Winter wheat is a soft wheat, and is grown in all 
parts of the U. S. principally the western, southern and eastern 
states. Flour made from winter wheat is called "Soft Wheal 
Flour*' and is used in breads, pastry, and macaroni, it con- 
tains less gluten, but is rich in starch. The best Hour, perhaps 
in all the world, is made in Minneapolis, and is shipped to all 
parts of America and many foreign countries. The leading 
brands are Occident, Gold Medal, Ceresota, and Pillsibury's 
Best.

Bread-Making 



Dry Yeast. 



[nto a eup of hike warm water, put a teaspoon of sugar 
and one and a half cakes oi' yeast. Let soak at least one hour. 
Have prepared' two cups of finely mashed potatoes, turn on 
them a half pint of boiling water, and stir in a heaping- table- 
spoon of flour, stir well and 1ft batter cool. Add eup of yeast, 
beat well, cover and let stand until morning. 

Sponge. 

To three pints of warm water, add enough flour to make a 
stiff hatter, stir in the yeast prepared the night before which 
v ill now make a medium batter. Beat thoroughly for five or 
six minutes. Cover, set in a warm place out of draught to 
vise, which under ordinary conditions will be light in one and 
one half to two hours. 

Kneading. 

A bread mixer may be used, but if tin' kneading is done *>" 
hand, begin mixing with a heavy spoon, sift in one sifter of 
Hour, stir, add one cup of sugar, one half cup Lard, more flour 
and heaping tablespoon of salt. Stir and add flour gradually 
;nitil dough becomes too stiff to use the spoon. Remove to 
floured kneading board, or finish kneading in the bread pan 
which is now done by hand. Sift in flour gradually, knead 
steadily. Remove all particles of dough from sides ami bottom 
of pan. Knead for twenty minutes or more. When in right 
condition dough will be elastic, and spongy, and will not lie 
inclined to stick to the hands. When kneading is done there 
should be no flour left in the pan. Cover first with bread pan 
cover, then with table cloth, or better, a cloth for the purpose. 



1 4 RHEA J ) MAKINGAND BE K AD B AK I N G 



Set to rise in a warm place, out of hot or cold draughts. 
It should be light in two to three hours. Temperature of room 
should he 72 to 80 degrees. 

Putting into loaves. 

Grease the baking pans well, use the sheet iron or iron 
enamel ware, as they are better bakers. For a single loaf, take 
about two pounds 1 of dough, and about one and one half pounds. 
when double loaves are baked in a pan. Mould each into shape 
and place in pan. Brush top with lard or butter and set to 
rise in even temperature, cover with light cloth. 

Under favorable conditions the bread will be up and double 
its size, in three fourths of an hour, sometimes less. 

Baking. 

Put the bread in a moderately hot oven, bake until nicely 
browned over top, which will take fifteen minutes, then reduce 
the heat about one half; to prevent scorching during the latter 
part of baking, place a sheet of brown or white paper over the 
bread. Bake one hour. Remove from pans, place on cloth to 
cool. Brush lightly while hot with butter. 

If bread raises too long it will be porous and dry. If it is 
very slow in rising it will be dry, or tough, soggy, and inclined 
to be sour. 

Olive oil can be used in bread in place of lard or other 
shortening, it is much better ; use it h\ the same quantity or a 
little less.

BREAD. 

Compressed Yeast. 

Dissolve 2 cakes of compressed yeast in half cup of luke 
warm water; rice or mash 3 or 4 medium sized boiled potatoes 
Miid add heaping- tablespoon flour, put this into bread pan and 
turn in one quart boiling water and beat up well. When cooled 
to luke warm, turn in yeast and stir in enoitgh flour to make 
a medium batter, beat briskly a few minutes and set away in 
warm place to rise. 

Dough. 

When light add seme Hour, half cup sugar, half cup lard, 
stirring briskly, one tablespoon salt and more Hour. When too 
stiff to stir with spoon, finish by hand, kneading until dough is 
spongy and elastic. Let rise and finish in the usual way. 

NUT BREAD. 

Nut bread is made much the same as other bread, only dif- 
fering in the proportion of ingredients, and the addition of 
nut meats. 

Yeast. 

Place in a cup of luke warm water IV. cakes dry yeast and 
1 teaspoon of sugar, soak 1 hour. To 1 cup of mashed pota- 
toes, add 1 tablespoon of flour and 1 cup of boiling water, stir and 
when cool add yeast, mix well and let set over night in a warm 
place. 

Sponge. 

Add to the yeast 1 quart of luke warm water and flour to 
make a sponge batter, cover and set away to rise. When light 
add 1 to V/n <-ups sugar Va cup lard or butter, 1 to iy 2 cups 
mil meats and knead as other bread, adding flour as needed. 



16 BREAD MAKING AND BREAD BAKING 

GRAHAM BREAD. 

On baking day a few loaves of graham bread can be made 
conveniently by making more bread sponge, using an extia 
yeast cake' and more moisture. For graham bread take J 
quart of bread sponge, \', to 1 cup of brown sugar, / 2 cup 
shortening, 1 heaping teaspoon salt and equal amounts of flour 
and graham flour, sift in as long as the batter can be stirred 
with 'heavy spoon; beat briskly and set to raise. 

When light put in greased pans, and when light again baice 
■ m quick oven, reducing heat in 10 or (15 minutes. 
Wholewheat Hour may be used instead of graham.

20 BRHAD MAKING AND BRKAD BAKING 



Pointers for Pastry 

For fancy cakes and pastry, use pastry flour, if it ran be 
had, the cake will be lighter, and the piecrust more flakey. 

Good housekeepers, however, use a good grade of bread 
flour, for bread, cake, and genera] baking purposes, with never 
a failure. Two points essential in cake making, are attention 
and preparation. To be prepared the working utensils should 
be clean and within reach. The materials used in the cake 
should be of the best quality. Your attention should not be 
interrupted by any other work. Speed in stirring up a cake 
adds to its success. 

I'se fresh sweet butter, fresh eggs, good baking-powder, and 
a good brand of flavoring extracts. 

The genera] ride for mixing a butter cake or any cake made 
with butter is as follows: — 

('ream the hotter, and when beaten light, gradually add the 
sugar, beating briskly until creamy. The yolks of eggs well 
beaten, should now be added, beat well and add the flavoring 
extracts. Sift Hour (mixed with baking-powder and salt) 
several times. Add Hour and liquid alternately, and when 
well beaten, fold in the lightly beaten whites of egos, and 
then the fruit, if any is used. 

FOR CAKES WITHOUT BUTTER. 

Beat the yolks of eggs very light. Add sugar slowly, beat- 
ing until spongy. Add the flavoring and what liquid may be 
used. 

The whites of eggs beaten to a froth folded in alternately 
with the Hour, which has been mixed with baking-powder arid 
salt, and sifted several times. 



BREAD MAKING iND BREAD BAKJNG 21 



Baling and Helps 

Have a moderate oven for baking sponge and angel cakes. 

Have a hot oven for baking cookies and layer cakes. 

Have a moderate oven for baking loaf, pound, and fruit 
cakes. 

The pans for baking medium sized loaf cakes should be 
greased and dusted with flour. 

The pans for baking large loaf, pound, and fruit cakes 
should lie lined with two or three thicknesses of greased paper. 

The batter should be spread evenly when turned into bak- 
ing tin. 

To test in baking a cake, pierce the center with a broom 
splint, if il comes out dry and (dean the cake is done. 

To Test the Oven. 

A moderately heated oven will scorch a piece of white paper 

to ;i light brown in five minutes. 

A hot oven will scorch it to a dark brown in five minutes. 

Sift flour once before it is measured, then add baking- 
powder and salt, and sift 2 or 3 times more. 

All measurements are level unless otherwise mentioned.

BOILED RICE. 

In many countries, rice is the chief article of food. More rice 
is used than any other grain, with the possible exception of 
wheat. 

in southern states rice is as commonly used, as the potato 
in the north. There are but few varieties or grades of rice in 
our markets. Jap head rice, a high grade, and Carolina head 
rice, with the cheaper grades, are the kinds we use. Wild rice 
can also be had, il is used principally in soups. 

Rice should be washed in several waters. When the water 
does not turn milky the rice is clean. Plenty of water should 
be used in cooking, and it must be boiling hot when the rice is 
not in. 

To one cup of idee, which will make a medium mess, have 
two quarts of water boiling and salted. Drop rice slowly into 
water, which should be kept boiling, and boil steadily until grains 
are soft, which usually takes 25 minutes. Do not stir the rice 
but try bottom of kettle with fork, to scrape loose any kernels 
that may begin to stick. 

A' hen rice is done it may be drained through a colander, then 
put back in kettle, or if there is not a great deal of water on 
1h" rice il need not be drained. Add cup of milk and set hack 
on range to keep hot.

Let syrup chain from sauce pan freely without scraping: then 
add flavoring and if you wish some nut meats, black walnuts are 
best. Beat steadily, giving it your attention as the setting point 
comes very suddenly, an indication of when it is beaten enough 
is when the candy begins to pull heavily on the fork, then it should 
be turned quickly on a buttered tin. It should harden in a short

SALT CUCUMBER PICKLES. 

Carefully pick cucumbers 3 to 4 inches in length, cutting the 
stem instead of breaking off the cucumbers, do not bruise, wash 
and set in a cool place for a day. Make a brine that will bear an 
egg or potato, boil and skim, when co.ol pour over cucumbers 
that have been closely packed in a jar or keg. Keep pickles 
weighted down and covered with brine. 

To freshen, soak in fresh water for a day or two. changing 
i lie water two or three times, a teaspoon of powdered alum added 
to the water while freshening will make the pickles firm 

CUCUMBER PICKLES. 

Prepare the cucumbers as for salt cucumber pickle-, only 
using a smaller size. Place in the jar or keg a layer of wild grape 
leaves, fresh picked, about an inch deep, then a layer of encum- 
bers, alternating until jar is filled; cover with a layer of grape 
leaves, then cover all with brine, made with one cup salt, % cup 
vinegar to 3 or 4 quarts of water. Set in a cool place and in 
;J or 4 weeks they will be ready for use. These pickles do not 
keep very Ioul;-. 

SAUERKRAUT. 

Everybody likes sauerkraut. There should he a jar or keg 
of a few gallons or more in every cellar; it is both healthy and. 
nourishing. If 5 to 10 gallons are to be made, select a large jar. 
but if a keg or barrel is to be used, select one that has had cider 
(>]• vinegar in it and scald it out well. 

Remove outer leaves from cabbage and cut each head in two 
in center, remove the heart and shred with kraut cutter. If kraut 
is made without a cutter use a large sharp knife, cut into the 
cabbage as far as the center and shred in that way. cutting as 
fine as possible. 

Drop the shredded cabbage into the jar or keg as fast as it 
is cut. and when there are three or four inches sprinkle in a hand-

ful of salt, and tamp it well, for this purpose use a stick three or 
four inches in diameter, with a square end. Put in more cabbage, 
;i handful or two of salt and tamp again, when it is tamped enough 
the brine will begin to show. 

Repeat until job is complete. A little sugar added improves 
the flavor. A pint to a pint and a half of salt is about the rule; 
too much salt will delay the kraut in curing, but it will keep 
longer, if there is not enough salt it will cure quickly but will not 
keep as long. 

Always keep the kraul weighted down, so thai the brine will 
cover it at all times. There will be plenty of brine if the shredded 
cabbage is properly tamped. Kraut will be ready for use in about 
three weeks, unless too much salt is used or it is kept in too cold 
a place. If made in cold weather it is best to se1 the kraut in a 
moderately warm place for the first three weeks: then place in a 
cool place.

Canning Fruits and Vegetables 



In canning i'ruil and vegetables, proper sterilization must be 
the rule, in both the material to be canned, and the jars or con- 
tainers. By sterilization is meant to heat to 212° or the boiling 
poinl for water, and kept at that heat for a certain time, to kill 
any bacteria or mold that may infest the articles to be canned. 
Fruits generally are sterilized much quicker than vegetables, some 
of which need boiling at a much higher temperature and for a 
longer time. \n canning do not use tin or chipped enamel uten- 
sils in cooking the fruit or vegetables. In preparing and handling, 
use silver spoons, forks and knives. 

Sweet corn is considered the most difficult of all vegetables 
to can, and tomatoes the least difficult. Canning sweet corn is 
nade quite simple in the following:

CANNED TOMATOES. 

Select firm, ripe, large tomatoes. Scald and peel, slice 
through the center the flat way, place one-half in the palm of 
the hand and press by closing the hand gradually forcing the 
seeds out. which should be put in a bowl, cut the halves into 
smaller pieces and drop into preserving kettle; drain the juice 
from the seeds through a seive and add to the fruit in the kettle, 
with a teaspoon salt to each 3 or 4 pints of fruit; heat slowly, 
stirring from the bottom, skim and boil slowly 5 to 8 minutes, seal. 

CANNED STRAWBERRIES. 

To wash strawberries, or any other berry that is inclined to 
be gritty, place berries in a basin and cover well with water, use 
hands to remove them from the water to another pan, and wash 
again if necessary. After strawberries are washed and drained, 
hull them if you choose; then place them in a granite pan; 
.sprinkle over them or dredge with one cup of sugar to two 
quarts of berries. Let stand a few hours or over night in a cool 
place. 

Then fill fruit jars with the berries, pressing them down 
somewhat as you put them in, but do not crush them. Take the 
juice drained from berries, add two cups sugar to each cup juice, 
set on range and heat clowly, boil 5 minutes. Set jars with fruit 
on a wooden or wire rack in a boiler, with covers on loosely 
without rubber rings, and fill with water until jars are half sun- 
merged. 

Boil 5 to 8 minutes after water begins to boil. Take jars 
from boiler, fill them with hot syrup, and set back in boiler, and 
boil 5 to 10 minutes longer, take out and seal. There usually is 
syrup enough to fill jars, sometimes more. When not enough 
make a little syrup of sugar and water. This method of canning 
keeps the berries whole, and preserves them in their own juice. 

Raspberries, currants, pitted sour cherries, and blackberries 
may be canned by the same method. If bubbles should appear 
in the cans or jars, after fruit cools, it should not be regarded as 
anything serious, as they generally disappear in a day or two. 



100 BREAD MAKING AND BREAD BAKING 

CANNED SOUR CHERRIES. 

Pit and cut cherries in two, put in preserving kettle, add 
% CU P °f sugar to each cup of cherries, stir and heat slowly. Cook 
slowly about 20 minutes. Skim and seal in glass jars. 

CANNED PLUMS. 

Wash one peck of plums. Put them into preserving kettle, 
cover with cold water; add *4 teaspoon soda, heat -slowly to 
boiling point. As soon as plums begin to burst remove from 
stove and drain, when cool pit them or they may be canned 
whole. Make a syrup of 1 cup water to three cups sugar; drop 
plums into this and heat slowly and skim. 

Add more sugar, as the fruit heats the amount of syrup 
increases but gets thinner. To can plums use about 3 cups of 
sugar to 4 cups of fruit. Simmer !/2 to % hour. 

CANNED PEACHES. 

Make a syrup of 6 cups sugar and 3 cups water; peel, pit and 
halve 2% to 3 dozen peaches, rinse them in cold water-, drain 
and drop in the hot syrup, which should be skimmed when 
necessary. To bring out the flavor of peaches they should cook 
slowly. Simmer V2 to 1 hour. 

Remove from the hot syrup with a fork, a piece at a time, 
and put into hot sterilized jars, fill about % full, strain and fill 
each jar with the hot syrup, seal. If there should not be enough 
syrup to fill the last jar, a little can be quickly made with hot 
water v and sugar. 

CANNED PEARS. 

Add 6 cups sugar to 3 cups water in the preserving kettle, 
boil 5 minutes. Peel, halve, core and rinse as quickly as con- 
venient as many pears as will cook in the syrup, cook slowly until 
tender, till into hot jars as quickly as possible, using fork. When 
filled to the amount required, strain in and fill with boiling hot 
s\ nip, seal. 



BREAD MAKING AND BREAD BAKING 101 

CANNED APRICOTS. 

Use the same method in canning apricots as for peaches, 
using a little more sugar and a little less water for the syrup. 
They may be peeled or canned with skins on, and may be pitted 
and halved, or left whole. 

CANNED CRAB APPLES. 

In the preserving kettle make a syrup of 6 cups sugar to 3 
cups water. After boiling 5 minutes drop in as much of the 
prepared fruit as will cook in the syrup, cook very slowly so as 
to keep the fruit as whole as possible. When cooked through, 
remove by stem and place in heated jars, fill jars with hot syrup 
Miid seal. In preparing crab apples to can remove the remains 
of blossoms, leave stems on, and wash. 

A few cloves dropped in the syrup while the crab apples 
are cooking, improves the flavor ; they should be taken out 
before the fruit is put in the jars.

Directions for Jelly Maying 



CURRANT JELLY. 

Select currants that are half ripened and freshly picked dur- 
ing sunshine and warm weather if possible. Pick from stems, 
wash and put into preserving kettle. Add a little water to keep 
fruit from scorching, say half a cup to each quart of fruit. Heat 
slowly until heated thoroughly, but do not boil. Mash well, use 
a wooden masher and turn into a jell bag to drain; let drain 
without pressing until it stops dripping. 

Measure juice and strain through a linen cloth and put in 
sauce pan to boil; heat slowly. If gas is used better have an as- 
bestos mat under sauce pan. 

"While juice is heating, place % amount of cane granulated 
sugar in a pan. and set in the oven to heat, let it heat slowly, 
almost to the point of scorching, and have it ready at the moment 
it is needed. Boil juice about 20 minutes, rather a little less 
than more. Skim when necessary. Add the hot sugar, stirring 
gently until sugar is dissolved, skim carefully. Begin testing 
by taking a teaspoon of the juice and putting it into a saucer to 
cool ; if cooked enough it will start to congeal almost at once 
and while it is still warm, if it does not set, test again allowing 
a minute or two between tests, boiling very slowly all the time. 
When ready for the glasses it can be strained again, a very diffi- 
cult task in most cases, but it gives a perfectly clear jelly. 
When turning the hot jelly into the glasses, they need not be 
hot to prevent breaking, if a teaspoon is placed in the glass 
while jelly is poured in.

CURRANT RASPBERRY JELLY. 

For currant raspberry jelly, use one-third currant and two- 
thirds raspberry juice with three-fourths amount of sugar and 
proceed as with currant jelly. 

CURRANT STRAWBERRY JELLY. 



Use one-fourth currant and three-fourths strawberry juice, 
with three-fourths amount of sugar, and proceed as with currant 
jelly. 



GOOSEBERRY JELLY. 



Prepare unripened gooseberries; put them into sauce pan, 
add water until it can be seen rising in the pan under the fruit. 
Set on the range to heat slowly, do not boil, when fruit begins 
to break open remove from range, mash and put in jell bag to

THE FIRST THANKSGIVING 

Thanksgiving day, Christmas and New Year's day are holi- 
days for Divine worship, thanksgiving and festivities, the former 
is an American holiday of New England origin, and dates from 
the year following the landing of the Pilgrims at Plymouth 
Rock in 1620. Some writers disagree as to this heing the first 
Thanksgiving day, holding that as there is no record to show 
that any religious services were held, and as the festivities ex- 
tended over a period of from three to six days in the open, it 
can only be regarded as a public festival. However, after a 
prosperous summer, and the gathering of a good harvest on 
which so much depended, the colony, that now had been reduced 
by death, to less than three score, decided to hold a period of 
thanksgiving and festivities, to which all were bidden, includ- 
ing an Indian chief and ninty of his tribe; all told 146 persons. 
To help provide for the feast Governor Braddock sent out four 
hunters into the forest to bring in wild fowl of which they ob- 
tained an abundance. 

History does not tell us upon what day this feast began, 
or in what month it was held, but it probably took place in the 
last days of October or in November, before the weather be- 
came too chilly for outdoor feasting. 

"We are told that roast wild turkey and other wild fowl and 
venison was served in great plenty, also pilmpkin pie, copy? 
bread, vegetables and Indian pudding; apples were unknown 
to the Pilgrims, and cranberry sauce, — there is nothing said 
about it, though the colony located near, where is now the fam- 
ous Cape Cod cranberry marshes. 

The next thanksgiving record says, was held on Feb. 22, 1623, 
this without festivities, followed the arrival of other Pilgrim^ 
among them friends and relatives of the colonists, this ship also 
brought supplies which were sorely needed- 



BREAD MAKING AND BREAD BAKING 117 

The summer of 1622 was not prosperous and the winter fol- 
lowed with disaster, distress, sickness and famine, and in the 
spring of 1623 after the crops had well started a drought 
threatened their entire destruction. 

Early in July a whole day was given to fasting and prayer, 
that rain Avould come to save their crops. There followed a 
plentiful rainfall that revived the fields and also the spirits of 
the colony, and in gratitude thereof a day of thanksgiving was 
ordered and observed — July 30, 1623. 

Some writers claim this was the second Thanksgiving oif the 
Pilgrims, others the third, then again it is claimed that this 
was the first harvest thanksgiving. In colonial times there was 
no set day for this holida}', it usually followed some important 
event such as the arrival of relatives and new colonists from 
the mother country, or a victory over the Indians or a period 
of peace with them. A bountiful harvest always called for the 
appointment of a day of thanks, and this led to the observance 
of Thanksgiving in the autumn ats the customary time. 

In 1863 President Lincoln proclaimed the last Thursday in 
November as a day of thanksgiving in all the land, and this 
has been followed annually by the President since. The day is 
a national holiday ; and is a legal holiday in all the states, with 
the possible exception of one or two. 

Thanksgiving is the great American feast day, it is observed 
in all parts of the country, in the island possessions and by 
Americans in foreign countries, it is a day of family reunions, 
visiting and recreation, much the same as when the day was 
first observed, though under far different conditions. 

When the contented housewife of today sets to preparing 
her next Thanksgiving dinner, let her recall the story of the 
first holiday and perchance it may be on the anniversary of 
that first Thanksgiving, prepared by a small group of homesick 
women in a strange land in thait long ago.

PREPARING THE THANKSGIVING DINNER. 

The preparation of the Thanksgiving- dinner should be be- 
gun the day before, so that all of the work will not fall to the 
forenoon of the holiday. 

The turkey or fowl that is to be used can be roasted in ad- 
vance and set back in the oven the next morning', it will heat 
through in an hour or two ; it should be basted frequently while 
heating. 

A more satisfactory way is to make the fowl ready for the 
roaster, then set it in a cool place over night, in the morning 
make the dressing ; if it is to be oyster dressing, fry one onion 
until browned, mix with other ingredients in the usual way, mix. 
in the raw oysters last, and stuff the fowl ; nse a covered roaster- 

When done remove fowl from pan and also part of grease, 
then make brown gravy with grease and dregs left in pan. 

Plum pudding should be made several days in advance, and 
steamed an hour or two before serving, it is best with un- 
cooked lemon sauce. 

Mince pie is equally as good made in advance and reheated 
lor serving. Pumpkin pie is very good served cold. 

Cranberry moulds can be made several days before they are 
needed, and should not be forgotten as they always go with a 
Thanksgiving dinner, as do mashed rutabagas. Mashed potatoes 
are by no means the least task in preparing a dinner; boil 
briskly, well covered with water, drain, set on edge of stove for 
a minute or two uncovered, salt, then mash well, add half cup 
sweet milk, stir briskly with masher or heavy spoon until snow 
white; take up in warmed vegetable dish, dot top with small bits 
of butter and then sprinkle with a few dashes of peprika. 

The menu on the following page is in greater variety than 
needed; sop can be omitted, one vegetable is enough, celery 



BREAD MAKING AND BREAD BAKING 119 

and olives are very nice, sweet pickles such as peach or melon, 
should be served rather than sour pickles. 

For dessert — Plum pudding and sauce is sufficient, possibly 
one variety of pie; fruit and nuts need not be served unless in 
place of something else. 

The salad should be fresh made ; for a cabbage salad, chop 
the cabbage very fine or use a food chopper, which some like 
better; use a good rich dressing.
