TO 

THE FOURTH LONDON EDITION. 



To this Fourth edition are added One Hundred and 
Thirty New Receipts, which will greatly improve the 
Comfort and Economy of all, especially of Catholic 
Families ; — ^being the best methods of making 

Omelettes, 

Puddings, 

Maiore and Savoury Pastier* 
* Maiore and Savoury Patties. 
Preserves, 
Tarts, 
Cakes, 
and the general business of 

The Pastry Cook and the Baker. 
Also, an easy and economical Process for preparing 

Pickles ; 

by which they will be ready in a fortnight, and remain 
good for Years. 



IV PREFACE. 

The Editor hopes that in the New Receipts, iht 
quantities of the various articles, and the processes for 
compounding them, are described so accurately and so 
, plainly, — that the most inexperienced person may 
work from them : but he does not vouch for all those 
new Receipts, — as some of them have not yet been 
proved in his own kitchen. 



mmim^ 



Among the multitude of causes which concur to Impair Heahb 
aod produce Disease, the most general is the improper quality 
pf our Food, this, most frequently, arises from the injudicious 
manner in which it is prepared ; — vet, strange, << passing 
strange," this is the only one, for which a remedy has not been 
aougS ; — and few persons bestow half so much attention on 
the preservation of their own Health, — as they daily devote to 
that of their Dogs and Horses. 

The observations of the Guardians of Health respecting Re- 
gimen, &c. have formed no more than a Catalogue of those ar- 
ticles of Food, which' they have considered most proper for 
particular Constitutions. 

Some Medical writers, have ^ in good set terms '' warned 
us against the pernicious effects of improper Diet; but not One 
has been so kind, as to take the trouble to direct us how to 
prepare food properly. 

The Editor has endeavoured to write the following Receipts 
so plainly, that they may be as easily understood in the Kitch- 
en as He trusts they will be reUshed m the Dining Room — and 
has been more ambitious to present to the Public, a ' Work 
which will contribute to the daily Comfort of All — than t» 
seem elaborately Scienti^c. 

The practical part of the philosophy of the Kitchen, is cer- 
tainly not the most agreeable 5 — Gastrology has to contend 
wjth its full share of those great impediments to al( great im*- 
provements in scientific pursuits, — the prejudices of the Igno- 
rant, — ^and the misrepresentations of the Envious. 

The Sagacity to comprehend and estimate the importance 

of uncontemplated improvement — is con^ned to the very few,. 

on whom Nature has bestowed a sufficient degree of perfection 

of the Sense which is to measure it; — the candour to make a 

1* 



VI PREFACE. 

fair report of it is still more uncommon^— and the kindness to 
encourage it cannot often be expected from those, whose most 
vital interest it is to prevent the developement of thatby^which 
their own importance — perhaps their only means of Existence 
— may be for ever eclipsed-^so as Pope says — 

" All fear, — None aid you, — and Few understand." 

Improvements in Agriculture and the Breed of Cattle have 
been encouraged by Premiums; — (see note under No. 19, and 
under No. 59.) Those who have obtained them, have been 
hailed as benefactors to' Society ; — ^but the Art of making use 
of these means of ante/toro^iTi^ Lt/e, anc^^upporftn^ a heal' 
thy Existence — Cookery, — has been neglected. 

While the cultivators of the raw materials are distinguished 
and rewarded, — the attempt to improve the processes, without 
which, neither Vegetable nor Animal substances are fit for the 
food of Man (astonishing to say,) has been ridiculed, — as un- 
worthy the attention of a rational Being ! ! ! 

This most useful Art,f — which the Editor has chosen to en- 
deavour to illustrate, because nobody else has — ^and because he 
knew not how he could employ some leisure hours more bene- 
ficially for Mankind, — than to teach them to combine thet^tVe 
with the dulce^ and to increase their pleasures, without impair- 
ing their Health or impoverishing their Fortune — has been for 
many Years his favourite employment, and " The Art op 

INVIGORATING AND PROLONGING LiPE, BY DiET AND ReOI- 

MEN," &c. and this Work, — have insensibly become reposi- 
tories, for whatever Observations he has made, which he 
thought would make us — Live happy and Live long. 

The Editor has considered the Aut of Cookery, not mere- 
ly as a mechanical operation, fit only for working Cooks — but 
as the Analeptic part of the Art of Physic, 

« How best the fickle fabric to support 

" Of moital man,— in healthful body how 

" A healthful mind, the long^est to mainUin."— 

is an Occupation — neither unbecoming nor unworthy. Philos- 
ophers of the highest class :— such only can comprehend its 
Importance, — which amounts to no less, than not only the en- 
joyment of the present moment, but the more precious advan- 
tage, of improving and preserving Health, and prolonging

long, and comfortably, or speedily Die of Stanratioa ia the 
midst of Plenty. 

These Rules and orders for the regulation of the business of 
the Kitchen have been exttemely beneficial to the £ditors 
own Health and Comfort. He hopes they will be equally so 
to others, — they will help those who enjoy Health, to preserve 
it — teach those who have delicate and irritable Stomachs, how 
to keep them in good temper — and with a little discretion 
enable them to indulge occasionally, not only with impunity^ 
bat with advantage, in all those alimentary pleasures which a 
rational Epicuret can desire. 

There is no question more frequently asked — or which a 
Medical man finds more difficulty in answering to the satisfac- 
tion of Himself and his Patient than — WheU do you wish me 
to eat f 

The most judicious choice of Aliment will avail nothing, un- 
less the Culinary preparation of it be equally judicious. — How 
often is the skill of a pains-taking Physician counteracted by 
want of corresponding attention to the preparation of Food — 
and the poor Patient, instead of deriving Nourishment — is dis^ 
tressed by Indigestion. 

Parmentier, in his Code Pkamutceutiquey has given a 
chapter on the preparation of Food — some of the following Re- 
ceipts are offered as an humble attempt to form a sort of 
Appendix to the Pharmacopceia — ^like pharmaceutic pre- 
scriptions they are precisely adjusted by weight and measure, 
— and in future, by ordering such Receipts of the Cook^s 
Oracle as appear adapted to the case — tiie recovery of the 
Patient, and the credit of the Physician, as far as relates to the 
administration of AHment, — need no longer depend on the 
discretion of the Cook. — For instance: Mutton Brothy (No. 
490 or 564;) Toast and Waler^ (No. 4G3;) WaUr Gruel^ 
(No. 572 ;) Beef Tea, (;No. 563 ;) and Portable Soup, (No. 
252.) This concentrated Essence of Meat — will be found a 
great acquisition to the comfort of the Army — the Navy — the 
Traveller — and the Invalid — by dissolving half an Ounce of 
it in half a pint of hot water, you have in a few minutes, half 
a Pint of good Broth for three halfpence. 

He has also circumstantially detailed the easiest, least ex- 
pensive, and most salubrious methods of preparing those high- 
ly finished Soups — Sauces — Ragouts — and piquante relishes,

otmost facility and certainty of succe88^--*and soon become a 
Good Cook. 

Will all the other Books of Cookery that ever were printed 
do this?*— The Editor has patiently pioneered through up- 
wards of Two Hundred Cookbrt Books, before he set about 
fecording these results of his own Experiments ! ! ! 

Store Sauces and many articles of Domestic Comfort 
which are extravagantly expensive to purchase, and can very 
seldom be procured "genuine — He has given plain directions 
how to prepare at Home — of infinitely finer flavour, and con- 
siderably cheaper than they can be obtained ready-made :•— 
for example, 

Mushroom Catsup, (No. 439.) 
Essence of Celery, (No. 409.) 
— — — - Anchovy, (No. 433.) 

SweetHerbs, (No. 417.) 

■■■ Lemon Peel, (No. 408.) 

Savoury Spice, (No. 421, 457, 459, 460.) 

Ginger, (No. 411.) 

Cayenne Pepper, (No. 404.) 
Curry Powder, (No. 456.) 
EsHALLOT Wine, (No. 402.) 
Portable Soup, (No. 252,) &c. &c. 

Thus, the table of the most Economical Family, may, by 
the help of this Book — be served with as much delicacy and 
salubrity, as that of a Sovereign Prince, — and the comforts of 
the Opulent are brought within the reach of the Middle Banks 
of Society. 



INTRODUCTION. 



Thk following Receipts are not a mere marrowless coUeetion 
ofshredsy and patches, and cuttings, and pastings; — bul a 
bonajlde register of Practical Facts, — accumulated by a per- 
severance not to be subdued, or evaporated, by the igniferous 
terrors of a Roasting Firein the Dog-days, — in defiance of the 
odoriferous and califacient repellents, ofRoeuting, — Boiling^ 
'-'Frying — and Broiling : — moreover, the author has submit* 
ted to a labour no preceding Cookery-Bookmaker, perhaps, 
ever attempted to encounter — having eaten each Receipt, be* 
fore he set it down in his book. 

They have all been heartily welcomed by a sufficiently well 
educated Palate, and a rather fastidious Stomach ; — ^perhaps 
this certificate of the reception of the respective preparations-* 
will partly apologise for the Book containing a smaller number 
of them, than preceding writers on this gratifying subject, have 
transcribed, — for the amusement of ^ every man's Abster," 
the STOMACH* 

Numerous as are the Receipts in former Books, they vary 
little from each other, except in the name given to them ; the 
processes of Cookery are very few, — I have endeavoured to 
describe each, in so plain and circumstantial a manner, as I 
hope will be easily understood, even by the Amateur, who is 
unacquainted with the practical part of Culinary concerns. 

Old Housekeepers may think I have been tediously mi- 
nute on many points, which may appear trifling ; — my Prede- 
cessors seem to have considered the Rudiments of Cookery 
quite unworthy of attention. These little delicate distinctions, 
constitute all the difference between a common and an elegant 

* ''The Stomach is the Grnnd Or^an of the bumao system, upon 
the state of which, all the powers aod feelings of the Individual de- 
pend." — See Hunter's Culina. 

" The faculty the Stomach has of communicating^ the impressions 
made by the various substances that are put into it, is such that it 
seems more like a nervous expansion from the Brain, than a mere re- 
ceptacle for Food." — Dr. Watbrhoose's Lecliire on Heallh.

Table, and are not trifles to the Young HousekeepieB; who 
inust learn them either from the communication of others^— or 
blunder on till his own slowly-accumulating and dear-bought 
experience teaches him. 

A wish to save Time, Trouble, and Money, to inexperienced 
Housekeepers and Cooks, — and to bring the enjoyments and 
indulgences of the Opulent within reach of the middle Ranks 
of Society, — were my motives for publishing this book ;-— I 
could accomplish it, only by supposing the lUader, (when he 
first opens it,) to be as ignorant of Cookery, — ^as I was when 
I first thought of writing on the subject.* 

I have done my best to contribute to the comfort of my fel- 
low creatures :— by a careful attention to the directions herein 
given, the most ignorant may easily learn to prepare Food— 
not only in an agreeable and wholesome^ — but in an elegant 
and economical manner. 

This task, seems to have been left for me, and I have en* 
deavoured to collect and communicate in the clearest and most 
intelligible manner, the whole of the heretofore abtruse Mys- 
teries of 4he Culinary Art^ which are herein, I hope, so plain- 
ly developed, that the most inea^^erienced student in the occult 
Art of Cookery,m0^ work from my Receipts^witk the utmost 
facility. 

I am perfectly aware of the extreme difficulty, of teaching 
those who are entirely unacquainted with the subject, and of 
explaining my ideas efifectually by mere Receipts, to those 
who never shook hands with a Stewpan. 

In my anxiety to be readily understood, — ^I have perhaps 
been under the necessity of occasionally repeating the same 
directions, in different parts of the book : but I would rather 
be censured for repetition, than for obscurity, — and hope I 
shall not be accused of Affectation, while my intention is 
Perspicuity.

INTnODUCTIONi

Our neighbours in France, are 8o justly farooas for their skill 
in the affairs of the Kitchen, that the adage says, ** as many 
Frenchmen^ as many Cooks/* surrounded as they are by a pro- 
fusion of the most delicious Wines, and seducing Liqueurs of- 
fering every temptation to render drunkenness delightful, yet a 
tippling Frenchman is a " vara avis** 

They know how so easily to keep Life in sufficient repair by 
good eating, that they require little or no screwing up with li- 
quid Stimuli. — This accounts for that ^'' toujour s gai/* and 
happy equilibriumj>f the animal spirits, which they enjoy with 
more regularity than any people: — their elastic Stomachs un- 
impaired by Spirituous Liquors, digest vigorously the food 
they sagaciously- prepare and render easily assimilable, by 
cooking it sufficiently, — wisely contriving to get half the work 
of the Stomach done by Fire and W^ter, till— 



<* The tender morsels on the palate melt, 
'< And all the force of Cookery is felt.'

See (No3. 5 and 238,) &c. 

The cardinal virtues of Cookery, *' cleanliness, fruoali- 
TT, NOURISHMENT, AND PALATEABLENESs,*' preside over each 
preparation ; for I have not presumed to insert a single compo- 
sition, without previously obtaining the *• irnprimatur** o( an en- 
lightened and indefatigable " COMMITTEE OF TASTE,** 
(composed of tborough-bred orands gourmands of the first 
magnitude,) whose cordial co-operatieo^ I cannot too highly 
praise ; and here do I most gratefully record the unremitting 
zeal they manifested during their arduous progress of proving 
the respective Recipei;, — they ^ere so truly philosophically aud 
disinterestedly regardless of the wear and tear of teeth and sto- 
mach, that their Labour appeared a Pleasure to them. — Their 
laudable perseverance, — which has enabled me to give the inex- 
perienced Amateur an unerring and economical Gfuide, how to 
excite as much pleasure as possible on the Palate, and occasion 
as little trouble as possible to the Principal Viscera, — has hard- 
ly been exceeded by those determined spirits who lately in the 
Polar expedition braved the other extreme of temperature, &c. 
in 9\y'ue of Whales, Bears, Icebergs, and Starvation. 

Every attention has been paid in directing the proportions of 
the following Compositions, not merely to make them inviting 
to the Appetite, but agreeable and useful to the Stomach ;•— ^

14 INTRODUCTION. 

nourislung without beiog ioflammatory, aad savoury without 
being surfeiting. 

I have written principdily for those who make Nourishmeot 
the chief end of Eating,* and do not desire to provoke Appe* 
tite, beyond the powers and necessities of Nature ;— proceed- 
ing however on the purest Epicurean principles of indulging 
the Palate, as far as it can be done without injury or offence to 
the Stomach — and forbidding nothing, but what is absolutely 
unfriendly to Heatth.f 

* I wish most heartily that the restorative process was performed 
by us poor mortals, in as easy and simple a manner, as it is in <' the 
Cookinfr Animals in the J^oon,'* who " lose no time at their meals ; 
but open their left side, and place the whole quantity at once in their 
stomachs, then shut it, till the same day in tlie next month, for th6y 
never indulge themselves with foo^ more than twelve times in a year." 
See Baron Munchausen's Travels. 

Pleasing the Palate is the main end in inost books of Cookery, but 
it is my aim to blend the toothsome loith the wholesome ; for, after all, 
however the hale Gourmand may at first difier from me in opinion, 
the latter is the chief concern ; since if he be even so entirely devoted 
to the pleasure of eating, as to think of no other, still the care of his 
liealth becomes part of that ; if he is Sick, he cannot relish his Food. 

** The term Gourmand or EpicuRir, has been strangely perverted ; 
it has been conceived synonimous with a Glutton, << ne pour la di- 
f^estiony" who will cat as long as he can sit, and drink longer than he 
can stand, nor leave his cup while he can lift it ; or like the great 
cater of Kent whom Fuller places among his Worthies, and tells us 
tliBt he did eat with ease, thirty dozens of Pigeons at one meal, — at 
another four score RabbvtSj' and eighieen Yards of Black Pudding, 
London Measure ! ! ! — or a fastidious Appetite, only to be excited by 
fantastic Dainties, as the brains of Peacocks or Parrots, the tougues.of 
Thrushes or JVightingales, or the teats of a lactiferous Sow. 

<' In the acceptation which I give to the term JEpicure, it means 
only the person who has good sense and good taste enough, to wish 
to have his food cooked according to scientific principles ; diat is to 
say, so prepared, that the palate be not offended— that it be rendered 
ca«y of solution in the Stomach, and ultimately contribute to Health ; 
ex^citing him as an animal, to the vigorous enjoyment of those recrea* 
tious and duties, physical and intellectual, which constitute the happi- 
ness and dignitj' of his nature." For this illustration I am indebted 
to my scientific friend Apicius C(elius, Jun. with whose erudite obser- 
vations several pages of this work are enriched, to which I have af- 
fixed the signature A. C. Jun, 

t " Although air is more immediately necessary to life than food, 
the knowledge of the latter seems of more importance ; it admits cer- 
tainly of great variety, and a choice is more frequently in our power. 
A very spare and simple diet has commonly been recommended as 
meat coodncive to Health ; — but it would be more beneficial to man- 
kind if we could show them that a pleasant and varied diet, was equal- 



INTRODUCTION. 15 

This is by no means so difficult a task, as some gloomy phi- 
losophers (uninitiated in culinary science) have tried to make 
the world believe — who seem to have delighted in persuading 
you, that every thing that is nice must be noxious; and that • 
CYery thing that is nasty, is wholesome. 

But'as worthy William Shakspeare declared he never found 
a philosopher who could endure the Tooth-ach patiently, — tho 
Editor protests that he has not yet overtaken one, who did not 
love a Feast. 

Those Cynical Slaves, — who are so silly, — as to suppose it 
unbecoming a wise roan, to indulge in the common comforts of 
Life^ — should be answered in the words of the French philoso- 
pher, *' Hey — What— do you Philosophers eat dainties ?*' said 
a gay Marquess. " Do you think,** replied Descartes, *' that 
God made good things only for fools ?'* 

Every individual, who is not perfectly imbecile and void of 
understanding, is an Epicure in his own way — the Epicures in 
boiling of Potatoes are innumerable — the perfection of all en- 
joyment depends on the perfection of the faculties of the Mind 
and Body — the Temperate man, is the greatest Epicure, — and 
the only true Voluptuary, 

The Pleasures of the Table, have been hij;hly appre- 
ciated, and carefully cultivated in all Countries — and in all 

\y consistent with hf altb, ns the very strict regimen ai Arnard, or the 
Miller of Essex. These and other abstemious peoplo, whe, havin<; ex- 
perienced the grckte^t extremities of bad health, were driven to tem- 
perance as their last refmurre, may run oat in praises of a simple 
diet ; but the probability is, that nothing but the dread of former suf- 
ferings could have given them the resoluiion to persevere in so strict 
a course of abstinence ; which, persons who are in health', and have 
no such apprehension, could not be induced to undertake, or, if they 
did, would not long continue. 

<' In all cases, great allowance must be made for the weakness of 
human nature ) the desires and appetites of mankind, must to a cer- 
tain degree be gratified, and the man who wishes to be most useful, 
will imitate the indulgent Parent, who whilst he endeavours to pro- 
mote the true interests of his children, allows them the full enjoyment 
ot all those innocent pleasures which they take delight in. Tf it conld 
be pointed out to mankind, that some articles used as food were hurt- 
ful, while others were in their nature innocent, and that the latter 
were numerous, various, and pleasant, they might, perhaps, be indu- 
ced to forego those which were hurtful, and confine themselves tu 
those which were innocent."— See Dr. Stark's Experimeiils on JHe(. 



16 mXRODUCTION. 

Ages, — and in spite of all the Stoics,-^every one will allow 
they are the first and the last we enjoy, — and those we taste 
the oftenedt, — above a Thousand times in a Year, every Year 
tff our Lives 1 1 1 

The Stomach, is the mainspring of our System, — if it he 
not sufficiently wound up to w^m the Heart, and support the 
Circulation, — the whole business of Life, will in proportion be 
ineffectively performed, — we can neither Think with precision, 
— ^eep with tranquillity, — Walk with vigour, — oxsiidown 
with comfort. ^ 

There would be no difficulty in proving, that it influences 
(much more than people in general imagine) all our actions: — 
the destiny of Nations has often depended upon the more or 
less laborious digestion of a Prime Minister* — see a very cu* 
rious Anecdote in the Memoirs of Count Zinzendorf iq 
Dodsley's Annual Register for 1762. 

The philosopher P^^^oras, seems to have been extremely 
nice in eating, — among bis absolute injunctions to bis disciples,

negative^-and niggardly of their positive precepts — iu the ratio, 

that it is easier to tell you not to do this, than to teach you bow 

to do that. 

Our great English moralist Dr. S. Johnson, bis biographer 
Boswell tells us, '' was a man of very nice discernment in the 
science of Cookery,*' and talked of good eating, with uncom- 
mon satisfaction. '' Some people,*' said be, *'*' have a foolish 
way of not minding, or pretending not to mind what they eat : 
for my part, I mind my Belly very studiously and very careful- 
ly, and I look upon it, that ho who does not mind bis Belly, 
will hardly mind any thing else." 

The Dr. might have said, cannot mind any thing else — the 
energy of our Brains is sadly dependent on the behaviour of 
our BowELsf — those who say *Tis no matter what we eat or

The following Anecdote I copy from Boswbll's Ufe of 

Johnson. 

Johnson. — " I co«ld write a better Book of Cookery than 
has ever yet been written ; — it should be a book on philosophi- 
cal principles. — I would tell what is the best BulcberV Meat 
—the proper season of different Vegeubies— and then, how to 
roast, and boil, and to compound." 

j)iUy, — " jdrs. Glasse'i Cookery^ which is th« best, was 
written by Dr. Hill." 

Johnson.-—'* Well, Sir — this shows how much better the sub- 
ject of Cookery* may be treated by a Philosopher ;+ — but you 

« We cannot reasonablj expect traDquilHtj of the Nervous System, 
whilst tbefe is disorder of the digestive organs. As we can perceive 
no permanent source of strength, bat from the digestion of our food, 
It becomes important on this account, that we should attend to its 
quantity, quality, and the periods of taking it, with a view to ensure 

its proper digestion. "-^Absritetht'b 8ur. Ob$. 

* ** If science can really contribute to the happiness of mankind, it 
must be in this department ; the real comfort of the majority of men 
in this country is sought for at their own lire-side ; how desirable does 
it then become to give every iodocement to be at home, by directing 
sdl the means of Philosophy to increase Domestic Happiness.'* — Sil*

« To understand the Theory of Cookery, we must attend to the 
Action of heat upon the various constituents of alimentary substances 
as applied directly and indirectly through the medium of some fluid, 
in the former way as exemplified." In the processes of RoAsriire and 
■ Boiling, the chief constituents of animal substances undergo the fol- 
lowing changes^^^he Fibtine is corrugated, the Albumen coagulated, 
the Gelaiine and Osmazome rendered more soluble in water, the Fat 
liquefied, and the Water evaporated. 

'< If the heat exceed a certain degree, the surface becomes first 
brown, and then scorched. In consequence of these changes, the 
muscular fibre becomes opaque, shorter, firmer, and drier ; the teu- 
dons less opaque, softer, and gluey ; the fat is either melted out, or 
rendered semi-transparent. Animal fluids become more transparent ; 
the albumen is coagulated and separated, and they dissolve gelatine 
and osmazome. 

" Lastly, and what is the most important change, and the immediate 
object of all Cookery, the meat loses the vapid nauseous smell and 
taste peculiar to its raw state^ and it becomes savoury and grateful.

Johnson.-^'*' No, Madam; Women can spin very well — . 
but they cannot make a good Book of Cookery." ' 

Mr. B. adds, " I nerer knew a man who relished good eat- 
ing more than he did : when at Table, he was totally absorbed 
in.the busmess of the moment: nor would be, unless in very 
high company, say one word, or even pay the least attention 
to what was said by others, till he had satisfied his Appetite." 

The peculiarities of his constitution were as great as those of 
his character ; Luxury and Intemperance are relative terins--- 
depending on other circumstances than mere <|uantity and qual- 
ity. Nature gave him an excellent Palate, and a craving Ap- 
petite, — and his intense application rendered large supplies of 
nourishment absolutely necessary to recruit his exhausted spirits. 
The fact is,— this Great Man had found out, that Animal 
and Intellectual Vigour* are much more entirely de^mdent 
upon each other, — than is commonly understood ; — especially, 
in those constitutions, whose digestive and chylopoetic organs 
are capricious and easily put out of tune, or absorb the " ©a- 
bulum vita^' indolently and imperfectly, — with such, it is only 
now and then, that the " sensorium commun^^ vibrates with 
the full tone of Accurately considerative, or creative energy. 
Thus does the Health always,— and very often the Life 

as in FR71N6, produjes nearly the samecbaoges ; a& the heat is suffi- 
cient to evaporate the water, anct to induce a degree of scorching. 

" But when water is the medium through which heat is applied 

as in Boiling, Stewing and Baking, the effects are somewhat differ- 
ent, as the heat never exceeds 212o, which is not sufficient to com- 
mence the process of browning or decomposition, and the soluble 
constituents are removed, by being dissolved in the water, forming 
soup or broth ; or, if the direct contact of the water be prevented, they 
are dissolved in the juices of the meat, and separate in the form of 
Gravy."

50 INTRODUCTION. 

** Tbe petition of the Archbishop of Canterbury, tvhicb 
was presented by Sir G. Naylor, claiming to perform the ser- 
vice of presenting a di^h of de la Groute to tiie Kino at the 
banquet, was considered by the Court, and decided to be al- 
lowed." 

A good Dinner is one of the greatest enjoyments of human 
life ; — and as the^practire of Cookery is attended with so ma- 
ny discouraging difficulties,* so many disgusting and disagree- 
able circumstances, and even dangers. We ought to have some 
regard for those who encounter them, to procure us pleasure, 
and to reward their attention, by rendering their situation every 
way as comfortable and agreeable as we can. Mere money is 
a very inadequate compensation to a complete Cook ;---fae 
who has preached Integrity to those in the Kitchen, — (see - 
** Advice to Cooksy*) may be permitted to recommend Ldberal" 
ity to those in the Parlour ; — they are indeed the sources of 
each other. 

Depend upon it, '* True Self-Love and Social — are the , 
same ;*' *' Do as you would be done by ;'* give those you are 
obliged to trust, every inducement to be honest, — and uo 
temptation to play tricks. 

When you consider that a good servant eatsf no more than 

^ * It is said, there are gsTKir chancer against even the most timplt 
dish being presented to the Mouth in absolute perfection ; for instance 
A Leg or muttov. 
Ist. — The Mutton must be good, 
2d. — Most have been kept a good time. 
8d.->-Must be roasted at a good fire. 
4th. — By a good Cook. 
6th. — Who must be in good temper, 
6tb. — ^With all this felicitous combination you mu8^faave good luck, 

and 
7th. — Good Appetite. — The Meat, and the Mouths which are to eat 
it must be ready for each other at the same moment. 

t To g^uard against '< la gourmandise\ of the second table, " pro- 
vide each of your servants with a large pair of spectacles of the high- 
est magnifying power, and never permit them to sU down to any meal 
without wearing them ; they are as necessary and as useful in a Kitch* 
en as Pots and Kettles : they will make a Lark look as large as a 
FowL^ a Goose as big as a Swan, a Leg of Mutton as large as a Hind 
Quarter of Beef ; a twopenny loaf as large as a quartern ;" and as 
Philosophers assure you that Pain even is only imaginary, we may 
Justly believe the same of Hunger. Thus, if a scruant who eats no 
more than one pound of f09d^ im^gines^ by the aid of these glasses,

a bad ODe, — how much waste is occasiootfd by provisions be* 
ing dressed in a slovenly and un^kilfu) manner — and bow mufh 
a good Cook (to whom the conduct of the Kiicbeu is confi- 
ded) can save you by careful management — no Housekeeper 
will hardly deem it an unwise speculation, — it is certainly to 
amiable experiment, — to invite the Honesty and InduUry of 
domestics, by setting them an example of Uhercdity^T-tX least, 
show them, that " according to their Pains, mil be their Gatng.^ 
But trust not your servants with the secret of their own 
strength ; — Importance of any kind, being whai human frailty 
is least able to bisar. 

Avoid all approaches towards Familiarity, which to a proT- 
erb is accompanied by Contempt, and soon breaks the neck of 
obedience; 

Servants are more likely to be praised into good conduct— 
than scolded out of bad — always commend them when they 
do right — ^to cherish the desire of pleasing in them, you must 
show them that you are pleased : — 

** Be to their fuilu a little blind. 
And to their virtoet very kind." 

By such conduct — ordinary Servants, will often be conver- 
ted into Good ones i—few so hardentd, as not to feel graiifi' 
ed when they are kindly and liberally treated^ 

It is a good Maxim to select Survanta not younger than 
THIRTY, — before that age, however comfortable you may eo- 
ideavour to make them, their want of experience, and the Hope 
of something still better — prevents their being satisfied with 
their present state. After they have had the benefit of expe* 
Hence, if they are tolerably comfortable, they will endeavour to 
deserve the smiles of even a moderately kind master, for Fear 
they may change for the worse. 

Life may indeed be very fairly divided into the seasons of 
Hope and Fear. Tn Youth, we hope every thing may be 
jright ; — in Age we fear every thing will be wrong.

Human nature is the same in all stations ;-<-if you 
can convince your Seryants, that you have a generous aud, 
considerate regard for their Health and Comfort — why should 
you iroagioe that they will be insensible to the good they re- 
ceive. 

Impose no commands but what are reasonable, — nor reprove 
but with justice and temper — the best yvay to ensure which, 
is — never to Lecture thentj till at least one day, after they have 
offended you. 

If they have any particular hardships to endure in your ser- 
vice, — let them see that you are concerned for the necessity of 
imposing it. 

Jf they are Sick, — remember you are their Patron as well 
as their Master, — not only remit their labour, but give them 
all the assistance of Food, Physic, and every comfort ia 
your power. Tender assiduity about an Invalid is half a Cure^

24 INTRODUCTION. 

Tbi9 observation applies especially to the Second Cook, or 
first Kitchen Maidj in Wrge families, who have by far the 
hardest place in the bouse, and are worse paid, and truly verify 
the old adage, ** the more work, the less idag-es.'*— -If there is 
any thing right, the Cook has the praise— when there is any 
thing wrong, as surely the Kitchen Maid has ihe blame. — Be 
it known, then, to honest John But.l, that this humble domes- 
tic, is expected by the Cook to take the entire management of 
all Roasts and Boils, Fish and Vegetables — i. e. tlie principal 
part of an EnglitJiman's dinner. 

The Master, who wishes to enjoy the rare luxury of a ta- 
ble regularly well served in the best style, must treat his Cook 
as his friend, — watch over her Health* with the tenderest 



* The greatest care should be taken by theVnan of fashion, t)iat 
his Cook's health be preserved :^-one hundredth part of the attention 
usually bestowed on his dog, or his horse^ will suffice to regulate her 
animal system. 

** Cleanliness, and a proper ventilation to carry off smoke and 
steam, should be particularly attended to in the construction of a 
kitchen ; — ^the grand seene of action, the fire-place, should be placed 
where it may receive plenty of light : — hitherto the contrary has pre- 
vailed, and the poor Cook is continually basted with her own perspi- 
ration." — jj. C. Jun. 

" The most experienced artists in Cookery cannot be certain of 
their work, without tasting : — they must be incessantly Tasting. — The 
Spoon of a good Cook, is continually passing from the Stewpan to 
his Tongue ; — nothing, but frequent Tasting his Sauces, Bagouts,&c. 
can discover to him what progress .hey have made, or enable him to 
season a Soup with any certainty of -success : — his Palate, therefore, 
must be in the highest state of excitability, that the least fault may be 
perceived in an instant. 

<< But, alas ! the constant empyreuraatic fumes of the stoves, the 
necessijty of frequent drinking, and often of bad beer, to moisten a 
parched throat ; — in short, every thing around him conspires quickly 
to vitiate the organs of taste ; the palate becomes blunted, its quick- 
ness of feeling and delicacy, on- which the sensibility of the organs 
of taste depends, grows daily more obtuse, and in a short time the 
gustatory nerves become quite unexcitable. 

" If you find your Cook neglect his business,— that his Ra- 
gouts are too highly spiced or salted, and his cookery has too much 
of the " haut go&ty" — yon may be sure that his Index of Taste wants 
regulating — his Palate has lost its sensibility, — and it is high time to 
c all in the i^ssistance of the Apothecary.

Besides understanding the managemeni of the Spit, — tht 
Stefvpan, — and the Rolling Pin, a Complete Cook must know 
how to go to Market, write legibly, and keep Accounts accu- 
rately. In well regulated PnFate families, the most convenient 
custom seems to be, that the Cook keep a house-book, contain- 
ing an account pf the miscellaneous articles she purchases— 
and the fiutcher\ Baker's, Butterman*s, Oreen»grocer's, Fish- 
monger's, Milkman's and Washing bills are brought in every 
Monday ; these it is the duty of the Cook to examine, (^fora 
she presents them to her employer erery Tuesday morning 
to be discharged. 

The ^idvantage of paying such bills weekly, is incalculable ; 
among others — the constant check it affords against any excess 
beyond the sum allotted for defraying them, and the opportu* 
nUy It gives of correcting increase of expense in one week by 
a prudent retrenchment in the next. '* If you would live even

To the preceding observations from the " Mmanaeh dt$ Gour-

chance of success, if he can prevail on his master to observe the same 
regime which he orders for his Cook,— or, instead of endeavouring to 
awaken an idle Appetite, by reading the Index to a Cookery Book, or 
an additional use of the Peppcr-Box and Salt Cellar— rather seek it

26 INTRODUCTION. 

^irork well worth the purchase of Young Housekeepers, called 
" The Honours of the Table, or the Art of Carving ;" the 
latter has been copied in a mutilated state into almost every 
Cookery Book that has been made during the last thirty years. 

The most complete Housekeeper's Account Book is 
Poole's published at No. 48, Fetter Lane. J t is an excellent 
plan to have a table of rules for regulating the ordinary expen- 
ses of the family, in order to check any innovation or excess 
which otherwise might be introduced unawares, and de- 
range the proposed distribution of the annual revenue. 

It is almost impossible for a Cook to attend to the business 
of the Kitchen with any certainty of perfection if employed 
in other household concerns. It is a service of such impor* 
tance, and so difficult to perform even tolerably well, that it is 
sufficient to engross the entire attention of one person. 

This is a Maxim which is neither understood nor admired 
in some families, where the Cook is expected to be a house 
servant also, and Coals are meted out to her by the Quart, and 
Butter by the Ounce, &c. Nevertheless, these ignorant and 
unreasonable masters and mistresses, are surprised, if most of 
their Ragouts, and Sauces, &c. are spoiled ; and the Roasts 
either burnt up, or not half done ; but bow can it be otherwise, 
— if the Cook is obliged to be the slave of the Bell,* Sx. as 
well as of the Spit ? 

'* If we take a review of the Qualifications that are indis-

several saucepans are in operation at the same time) the simmering of 
one, the ebullition of another, and the full toned warbling of a third. 

** It is imperiously requisite that her organ of smell be highly sus- 
ceptible of the various effluvia , that her nose may distinguish the per- 
fection of aromatic ingrediepts, and that in animal tubstanees it shall

above all, her olfactories should be tremblmg alive to mastiness and 
empyreuma. 

''It is from the exquisite seqBibility of her palate, that we admire 
and judge of the Cook '^ from the alUance betw«ea the olfactory and

X\ facetious Gourmand suggests that the old story of "lighting a 
Candle to the Devti" probably arose from this adage — and was an 
pffering presented to his InCeraal Majesty, by some Epicure who^ was

215 INTRODUCTION. 

I did not presume to offer any observations of my own, till 
I bad read all that I could find written on the subject, and sub- 
mitted (with no small pains,) to a patient and attentive consid- 
eration of every preceding work, relating to culinary concerns, 
that I could meet with. 

These Books rary very little from each other, except in the 
preface — they are ' 

** Like in all else ts one Egg^ to anoUier :" 

'* ab U720, disce omnegy* cutting and pasting seem to have be ea 
much oftener employed than the Pen and Ink : any one who 
has occasion to refer to two or three of them, will find the Re-. 
ceipts almost always ** verbatim et literatim ;" equally unin- 
telligible to those who are ignorant, — and useless to those Vvho 
are acquainted with the business of the Kitchen. 

The following Works are in my own Library ; others my 
friends have favoured me with the perusal of, amounting in all 

10 not less than 250 Volumes. 

[Dr. K. here enumerates the names of the volumes ; the repetition 
will be of little use to the American public] 

During the Herculean labour of my tedious progress through 
these books-*many of which did not afford the germ of a sin- 
gle idea— I have often wished that ibe authors of them had 
been satisfied with giving us the results of their own practice 
and experience— -instead of idly perpetuating the errors, prej- 
udices, and plagiarisms, of their predecessors, — the strange, 
unaccountable, and uselessly extravagant farragos, and hetero- 
geneous compositions, which fiU their pages, are combinations 
no rational being would ever think of either dressing or eating, 
and without ascertaintbg the practicability of preparing the re- 
oeipts, and their fitness (or food when done, they should never 
have ventured to recommend them to others ;— *the reader of 
them will often put the same qucRre, as Jeremy^ in Congreve's 
comedy of " Love for Love,^ when Valentine observes, 
" There's a page doubled down in Epictetus, that is a feast for 
an Emperor. — Jer. Was Epictetus a real Cook, — or did he 
only write Receipts?" 

Half of these books are made up with pages cut out of ob- 
solete works, such as the " Choice Manual of Secrets," the 
** true Gentlewoman^ s Delight^** &c. of as much use, in this 
Age of rejinementy as the following curious passage from 
" The Accomplislied Lady's Bich Closet of Rarities, or In^ 
genious GenilewomaWs DeUghtful Companiony* which (

tion for which, would be *' a dangerous budgef of fuigar er«

ener's Calendar" and " the Publican's Daily Companion." 

Thomas Carter, in the preface to bis " Cily and Country 
Cooky" says, '*What I have published, is almost the only book, 
one or two excepted, which has of late years come into the 
world, that has been the result of the author's own practice 
and experience: for though very few eminent practical 
Cooks have erer cared to publish what they knew of the art, 
yet they have been prevailed on, for a small prefnium from a

sot when you have meat in your mouib ; and do not smack like a 
Pigf nor venture to eat Spoonmeai so hot that the tears stand in your 
Eyes, which is as unseemly as the GerUhwoman who pretended to 
have as little a Siomaeh as she bad a Mouth, and therefore would aoi 
swallow her P^at by spoonful ; but took them one by one and cut 
them in two before she would eat them. It is very uncomely to drink 
so large a draughty that your Breath is almost gone — and are forced

permit me to bury these, my experiences, with my silver hairs, 
in the ^rave." 

Those high and mighty Masters and Mistresses of the Ali- 
mentary Art, who are commonly called '^ Profess" Cooks — are 
eaid to be very jealous and q^ysterious beings : — ^and that if in 
a long Kfe of laborious Stove work, they have found out a few 
useful secrets — they seldom impart to the public the fruits of 
their experience, but sooner than divulge their discoveries for 
the benefit and comfort of their fellow creatures — often run the 
risk of a reprimand from their employer?,-— ajid will sooner

The silly selEshoess of short-sighted mortals, is never more 
extremely absurd — than in their un pro 6 table parsimouy, — of 
what is of no use to them, but would be of actual value to oth-

serve but to shroud it in almost impenetrable obscarity : and in gene- 
ral, so extravagantly fond are the professors of an art of keeping up 
all the pomp, circumstance, and mystery, of it, and of preserving the 
accumulated prejudices of ages past undiminished, that one might

overcome these obstacles, and penetrate the veil of science, were de-

them, — and their " rule of T%«m6" is 80 extremely indefinite,* 
— that if the same dish be diessed by different persons, it will 
generally be so different, that nobody would imagine they had 
worked from the same directions, which will assist a person who 
has not served a regular apprenticeship in the Kitchen ; no 
more than reading " Robinson CrvMoe^* would enable a Sail- 
er to steer safely from England to India. 

It is astonishing how cheap Cookery Books are held by 
pra(^tical Cooks : when I applied to an experienced artist to 
recommend me some books that wotild give me a notion of the 
first principles and rudiments of Cookery, he replied with a 
smile — " You may read Don Quixote or Peregrine Pickle^ 
they are both very good books.'' 

Careless expressions in Cookery are the more surprising, as 
the Confectioner is regularly attentive, in the description of 
his preparations, to give the exact quantities, though his basi* 
ness, compared to Cookery, is as unimportant, as the Ornamen- 
tal is inferior to the^ Useful. 

The maker of Blancmange, Custards, &c., and the endless 
and Useless collection of pretty playthings for the Palate, (of 
first and second childhood, for the vigour of manhood seeketh 
not to be sucking Sugar-candy, or sipping Turtle,) is scrupu- 
lously exact, even to a grain, in his ingredients ; whilst Cooks 
are unintelligibly indefinite, although they are entrusted with 
the administration of our food, upon the propef* quality and 
preparation of which^ all our powers of Body and Mind de^ 
pend; — their Energy^ being invariably^ in the ratio, of the 
performance of the restorative process, i. e. the quantity, qua!* 
ity, and perfect digestion of what we eat and drink ; and a 
sufficient portion of sound Sleep, *' the balm of hurt minds, 
chief nourisher in life's feast, great Nature's second course." 

Unless the Stomach be in good humour, every part of the 
machinery of life must vibrate with languor ; — can we then 
be too attentive to its adjustment ! ! I 

* " lu the present language of Cookery, there has been a woeAil 
departure from the simplicity, of owe ancestor«,8Uch a farrago of unap-

others disguised from the Italian, some misapplied from the Gernuw, 
while many area disgrace to the English. What can any person

In " the Affairs of the MoiUhT the strictost pancluality is in- 
dispensable ; — the Gastronomer ought to be as accurate aii 
observer of Tifne, as the Astronomfr. The least Delay pro- 
duces fatal and irreparabh Misfortunes, 

Almost all other Ceremoniea and Civil Duties may be put 
otTfor several hours without much iDConvenience, and all, may 
be postponed without absolute Danger. — A little Delay, qaay 
try the patience of those who are waiting; but the act itself 
will be equally perfect and equally valid. — Procrastination 
sometimes is rather advantageous than y. prejudicial. It gives 
l\me for Reflection — and may prevent our taking a step which 
wonld have made us miserable for Life ; the delay of a Couri- 
er has prevented the conclusion of a Convention, the signing 
of which might have occasioned the ruin of a Nation. 

If from Affairs the most important, we descend to our Pleas- 
ures and Amusements, we shall find new arguments in sup- 
port of onr assertions. The putting off a Rendezvous, or a 
Ball, &c. will make them the more delightful. To hope, is to 
enjoy, 

" Man never iSj but always to be, blett." 

The anticipation of Pleasure warms our imaginalioa, and keeps 
those feelings alive, which possession too often extinguishes. 

** 'Tis Expecit^ion only makes us blest ; 
'^ Enjoyment disappoints us at the beit." 

Dr. Johnson has most sagaciously said : " Such is the state 
of Life, that none are Happy but by the anticipation of Change: 
the Change itself is nothing : when we have made it, the next 
Wish, is immediately to change again." 

However singular our assertions may have at first appeared 
to those who have not considered the subject, we hope by this 
time we have made converts of our readers, and convinced the 
^' Amateurs de B&nne Chere " of the truth and importance of 
our remarks; and that they will remember, that Dinner is the 
only act of the day which cannot he put offvrilh impunity y for 
even five minutes. 

In a well regulated family, all the Clocks and Watches 
should agree ; on this depends the fate of the Dinner ; what 
yoould be agreeable to the Stomacht (^nd restorative to the

System^ if served at two o clock, — will be uneatable and i7»« 
digestible at a quarter past. 

The d ning room ebouid be furnished wilh a good going 
Clock ; — the space ever the Kitchen fire-place with another, 
vibrating in unison with the former, so placed, that the Cook 
may keep one Eye on the Clock, and the other oo the Spit, 
&c. She will calculate to a minute the time required to roast 
a large Capon or a little Lark, — and is equally attentive to the 
degree of heat of her Stove, and the time her Sauce remains oa 
it — when to withdraw the Bakings from the oven, the Roast 
from the spit, and the Stew from the pan. 

With all our Love of punctuality, the first consideration 
tnust still be, that the Dinner, " be well done when His done^^ 

It is a common fault with Cooks who are oveT'amrioiut 
about Time — to overdress every ^ thing — the Guest bad belter 
wait than the Dinner — a little delay will improve their appe« 
tite* ; — but if the Dinner waits for the Guests, it will be dete- 
riorated every minute ; — therefore the Host who wishes to en- 
tertain his friends with food perfectly well dressed, must, while 
he most earnestly endeavours to impress on their minds the 
importance of being punctual to the appointed hour, — will still 
allow his Cook — her quarter of aa bourns grace. 

The old Adage that <' the Eye is often bigger than the 
Belly,'' is often verified by the ridiculous vanity of those, who 
wish to make an appearance above their fortune — nothing can 
be more ruinous of real comfort than the too common custom 
of setting out a table, with a parade and a profusion, unsuited 
not only to the circumstances of the Host, but to the number of 
the guests ; — or more fatal to true Hospitality, than the mul- 
tiplicity of dishes which luxury has made fashionable at the ta-

On such an unfortunate occasion, when the Stomach sends 
forth eructant signals of distress, for help, the Peristaltic Per* 
suaders are as agreeable and effectual assistance as can be offer-

Thus Indigestion is easily and speedily removed,-— ^/>pett7e

from which we extract the following prescription— 

To make Forty Peristaltic Persuaders. Take — 

Turkey Rhubarb, finely pulverised,— two dracbms. 
Syrup, (by weight) one dracbm. 
Oil of Caraway, -ten drops (mioims.) 
t Maae into Pills,, each of which will contain TTiree Graint of 
Rhubarb. 

" The Dose of the Persuaders roust be adapted to tbe 
constutional peculiarity of the Patient — when you wish to ac- 
celerate or augment the Alvine Exoneration — take two— three 
—or more, according to the effect you desire to produce — Tico 
Pilis will do as much for one person, as fioe or six will for 
another ; they will generally very regularly perforin what yo«

pen to-morrow ; — and are therefore as convenient an argument 
against Constipation as any we are acquainted with. 

'* The most convenient opportunity to introduce them to the

has no particular business of Digestion, &c. to attend to — i. e. • 
at least half an hour before breakfast. Physic must never in- 
terrupt the Stomach, when it isenga^d in digesting Food. 

** From two to four Persuaders, will generally produce one 
additional motion, within twelve hours. They may be taken 
at any time by the most delicate Females, whose constitutions 
are so often distressed by constipation — aud destroyed by the 
drastic purgatives they take to relieve it."

ready for actioo, aud ibe Eaters ready for ibe Eatables^-wbich 
tbe least delay will irreparably injure: — therefore the Gour- 
mand ^ill be puDctaal for tbe sake of gratifying bis ruling

an indigestion bom eating iU-^dressed food ; and the Rational 
Cpicuite, who happily attends the Banquet with ** men» sana

reasons, but that he may not lose the advantage of being in- 
trodaoed to the other Guests. He considers not only what i» 
on the Table, — but Who are around it; — his principal induce- 
ment to leave his own Fire-side, is the charm of agreeable and 
instructive Society, and tbe opportunity of making connex* 
ions, which may augment the interest and enjoyment ofexis« 
tence. 

Ills the most pleasing part of the Duty of the Master of 
Ike Feastj (especially when the Guests are not very nume- 
rous, j:) to take advantage of these moments to introduce them 
to one another, uaming them individually in an audible voice, 
and adroitly laying hold of thotud ties of acquaintanceship or 
profession which may exist between them. 

This- will much augment the pleasures of tbe Festive 
Board. — to which it is indeed as indispensable a Prelude as an 
Overture to an Opera ; and the Host will thus acquire an ad- 
ditional claim to the gratitude of his Guests. We urge this 
point more strongly, because, from want of attention to it, we 
have seen more than once, persons whom many kindred ties 
"would have drawn closely together, pass ap entire day without 
opening their lips to each other, because they were mutually 
ignorant of each other's names, professions and pursuits. 

To put an end at once to all GeriBmony as to the order in 
vshich the Gtiests are to sit, it will save much time and trouble 
if the master of the House adopts the simple and elegant 
method of placing the name of each Guest in the plate which is 
intended for bim. This proceeding, will be of course the

Le Journal des Dames ioforms us, tbfit in several fashiona- 
ble houses ia Paris, a new arrangement bas been introduced in 
placing the company at a Dinner table. 

The Ladies first take their places, leaving intervals for the 
Gentlemen ; after being seated, each is desired to call on a 
gentleman to sit beside her ; and thus the Lady of the House 
is relieved from all embarrassment of etiquette, as to rank and 
pretensions, &c. 

But without doubt, says the Jpurnalist, this method has its 
inconveniences. 

*^ It may happen that a bashful beauty dare not name the ob- 
ject of her secret wishes, and an acute observer may determine^ 
from a single glance, that the elected is dot always the chosen,** 

If the Party is large, the Founders of the Feast should sit in 
the middle of the Table, instead of at each end, — thus they 
will enjoy the pleasure of attending equally to all their Friende 
— and being in some degcee relieved from the occupation of 
Carving — will have an opportunity of administering all those 
little attentions which contribute so much to the comfort of 
their Guests. 

If the Guests hsve any respect f«f their Host, — or prefer a 
well-dressed dinner to one that is spoiled, instead of coming 
half an hour after, they will take care to make their appearance 
a quarter of an hour before the time appointed. 

The operations of the Cook are governed by the Clock, — 
the moment the Roasts, S^c, are ready^ they mtist go to table, 
if they are to be ealen in perfection. 

An invitation to come at Five o'clock, seems to be general- 
ly, understood to mean Six ; Five precisely, AaZf past Jive; 
and NOT LATER THAN FivB, (so that Dinner may be on the 
.table within ten minutes after, allowing this for the variation of 
watches,) Five o'clock exactly. 

Be it known to all Loyal Subjects of the Empire of Good' 
living, that the Committee op Taste have unanimously re- 
solved, " an Invitation to ETA BETA PI must be in 
" Winting, and sent at least ten days before the Banquet — and 
must be answered in Writings (as soon as possible after it is 
received) — within Twenty-four hours at latest^* — especially 
if it be not accepted — then, in addition to the usual compli-

Nothing can be more disobliging tbao a refusal \vhich is not 
grounded on some very strong and unavoidable cause, except

useless expense.

this subject, *< I have always been punctual at the hour of

There are some, who seldom keep an appointment; — wa 
can assure them tbey as seldom '' 'scape without whipping" — 
and exciting those murmurs which inevitably proceed from tha 
best regulated Stomachs, — when they are empty and impatient 
to be fijicd. 

The mo3t amiable Animals, when hungry,, become iJl-tem*

— and attributing to us a thousand imaginary ones^

bow they wound the feelings of others, if they possess brilliant

Tools ;— 'but deceive themselves sadly, if they possess all tha 
Wisdom, and all the Wit in the World, — they fancy they can 
ever be esteemed as Friends.

phlegmatic philosophers,

I once heard a gentle hint on this subject, given to a Blue- 
mould fancier, who by looking too long at a Stilton cheese, 
was at last completely overcome by his Eye exciting his Appe- 
tite, till it became quite ungovernable and unconscious of ev- 
ery thing but the mity objed of his contemplation ; he began 
to pick out in no small portions the primest parts his£ye could 
select from the centre of the Cheese. 

The good-natured Founder of the Feast, highly amused at 
the Ecstacies each morsel created in its passage over the palate 
of the enraptured Gourmand, thus encouraged the perseverance 
of his Guest — " Cut away, my dear sir, cut away, use no Cer- 
emony, I pray :— I hope you will pick out all the best of my 
Cheese — thb rind and Uie botten will do very weU for viy 
Wife and Family I V 

Half the trouble of waiting at table may be saved, by 
giving each guest, two plates, two knives and forks, two pieces 
of bread, a Rpoon, a wine glass, and a tumbler, and placing the 
Wines and Sauces, and the Magazine op Tavte, (463,) &c. 
as a Dormant, in the centre of the table ; one neighbour may 
then help another. 

Dinner tables are seldom sufficiently lighted, or attended — 
an active waiter will have enough to do, to attend upon half a 
dozen active Eaters — there should be half as many Candles as 
:there are Guests — and their flame be about 18 inches above the 
table — our foolish modern pompous Caodelabras, seem intend- 
ed to illuminate the Ceiling, rather than to give light on the 
Plates, &c.

^0 FRIENDLY ADVICE TO COOKS* 

Uocharitableness, can suggest to your fellow -servants ; — every 
one of whom — if less diligent,— or less favoured than yourself 
— will be your Enemy. 

While we warn you against making others your Eoeray — 
we must caution you also to take care that you do not Your- 
self become your own and greatest Enemy. ** Favourites are 
Dever in greater danger of falling, than when in the greatest fa- 
vour**— 'Which often begets a careless inattention to the com- 
mands of their employers, and insolent overbearance to their 
equals — a gradual neglect of duty — and a corresponding for- 
feiture of that regard— which can only be preserved by the 
meaifr which created it. 

If your Employers are so pleased with your conduct as to 
treat you as a friend rather than a servant — do not let their 
kindness excite your self-conceit, so as to make you for a mo- 
ment forget you are one. Condescension even to a proverb 
produces Contempt in inconsiderate minds — and to such the ^ 
▼ery means which Benevolence takes to cherish attention to 
duty, becomes the cause of the evil you wished to prevent. 

To be an agreeable Companion in the Kitchen, — without 
compromising your duty to your Patrons in the Parlour, — ^re- 
quires no small portion of good sense and good nature ; in a 
word, you must ^^doas you wotdd be done by,^ 

Act for, and speak of bvert body, as if they were 

PRESENT. 

We hope the Culinary Student who peruses these pages, . 
will be above adopting the common, mean and base, and ever 
unsuccessful way of '* holding with the Hare, and running with 
the Hounds,"-*-of currying favour with fellow -servants by 
flattering them, and ridiculing the Mistress when ia the Kitchen, 
— and then prancing into the Parlour^ — and purring about her, 
and making opportunities, to display all the little faults you can 
find (or inoent) that will tell well against those in the Kitchen 
—assuring them, on your return, that they were praised, — 
for whatever you heard them blamed, — and so, excite them to 
run more, extremely into any little error, which you think will 
be most displeasing to their Employers — watching an oppor- 
u nity to pour your poisonous lies into their unsuspecting ear?, 
when there is no third person to bear witness of your Iniquity 
— making your Victims believe, it is all out of your sincere 
regard for them — assuring them (as Betty says in the Man of

'* if your Employers are hasty, and have scolded without 
reason — bear it patiently — they will soon see their error, and 
be happy to make you amends. Muttering on leaving the 
room— or slamming the door after you, is as bad as an imper- 
tinent reply — it is, in fact, showing that you would be imperti- 
nent if yon dared."

Garlic, and Clove, or Allspice, combined in certain pro- 
portions, produce a flavour very similar to Assafoetida. 

The organ of Taste is more rarely found in perfection, and 
is sooner spoiled by the operations of Time, excessive use, &c. 
than either of our other senses. 

There are as various degrees of sensibility of Palate, as there 
are of gradations of perfection in the Eyes and Ears of Pain- 
ters and Musicians : — after all the pains Which the Editor has 
taken to explain the Harmony of subtle relishes, — without na- 
ture has given the Organ of Taste in a due degree, this book 
will, alas! no more make an Osborm* — than it can a Rey- 
nolds — or an Arnb. 

Where nature has been roost bountiful of this faculty, its 
sensibility is so easily blunted, — by a variety of unavoidable 
rircu instances, — that the Tongue is, very seldom, in the high- 
est condition for appreciating delicate flavours, or accurately 
estimating tbe relative force, of the various materials, the Cook 
employs in the composition of an harmonious relish ; — Cooks 
express this refinement of Combination by saying, a well flnisb- 
ed Ragout " tastes of every thing, and tastes of nothing ;** 
(this is ** kitchen gibbtinsk,^* for a Sauce in which the compo- 
nent parts are well proportioned.) 

However delicately sensitive nature may have formed the 
organs of Taste, — it is only during those few happy moments^ 
— that they are perfectly awake, and in perfect good humour 
(alas ! how very seldom they ore) — that the most accomplish- 
ed and experienced Cook, has a chance, of working with any 
degree of certainty, without the auxiliary tests of the balance 
and the measure ; — by the help of these, when you are once 
right, it is youf own fault if you are ever otherwise. 

The sense of Taste, depends much on the health of the In- 
dividnal, and is hardly ever for a single hour, in the samestate,

SBIENPLY ADVICE TO COOKS. &B 

-^such is the extremely iotiiDate Aympatby, between the Sto- 
mach and the Tongue, that ia proportion u the former k 
£mpty, the latter is acute and sensitive : — this is the cause thai 
*' good Appetite is the best Sauce" — and that the dish we find 
relishing and savoury at Luncheon^ — is insipid at Dinnerf — 
and at Supper quite tasteless. 

To taste any thing in perfection, the Tongue must be moist- 
ened, or the substance applied to it contain moisture — the 
nervous papiils which constitute this sense are roused (o still 
more lively sensibility by Salt — Sugar — Aromatics, &c. 

If the Palate becomes dtill by repeated tasting, one of the 
best ways of refreshing it — is to masticate an Apple, or to 
wash your mouth well with Milk. See p. 2%. 

The incessant Exercise of Tasting, which a Cook is obliged 
to submit to ducing the Education of her Tongue, — frequently 
impairs the very faculty she is trying to improve. ** 'Tis true 
— 'lis pity — and pity 'tis," (says a grand Gourmand^) " 'tis 
true, — her too anxious perseverance to penetrate the mysteries 
of Pafatics may diminish the tact, exhaust the power and de- 
stroy the IndeXy without which all her labour is in vain." 

Therefore, a sagacious Cook, instead of idly and wantonly 
wasting the excitability of her Palate— on the sensibility of 
which, her reputation and fortune depend, wbep she has as- 
certained her relative strength of the fiavour of the various in- 
gredients she employs, will call in the Balance ard the Meas- 
ure, to do the ordinary business, and to preserve her Organ of 
Taste with the utmost care, that it may be a faithful Oracle, to 
refer to, on. Grand occasions, and new Compositions,* — of 
these an ingenious Cook may form as endless a variety, as a 
Musician with his seven notes, or a Painter with his colours : 
— read chapters 7 and 8 of the Rudiments of Cookery. 

Receive as the highest testimonies of your Employers' re- 
gard, whatever observations they may make on your work- 
such admonitions are the most unequivocal proof s^ of their de- 
sire to make you thoroughly understand their taste — and their

Gravy, see (No. 3^6,) which is left, it will save many pounds 
of Meat in making sauce for Hajshes, p6uUryy and many little 
dishes* 

Many things may be re-dressed, in a different form, from 
that in which they were first served, and improve the appear- 
ance of the table without increasing the eicpeose of it. 

Cold Fish,— Soles— Cod — Whitings — Smelts, &c. may 
be cut into bits, and put into £scallop Shells — with Cold Oys- 
ter, Lobster, or Shrimp Sauce, and bread crumbed and put 
into a Dutch Oven, aad browned like scalloped Oysters. 
(No. 185.) 

The best way To WAitm cold M£At is tosprinkle the joint 
over with a little salt, put in a D^jtch Oven, at some distance 
before a gentle fire, that it may warm gradually — watch it 
carefully, and keep turning it tilt it is quite hot and brown : 
it will take from twenty minutes to three quarters of an hour, 
according to its thickness — serve it up with Gravy ; — this is 
much better than Hashing it, and by doing it nicely, a Cook 
will get great credit. Poultry, (No. 530*) ; Fried Fish, 
(See No. 145,) &c. may be re-dressed this way. 

Take eare of the Liquor you liave boiled routtry or Meat 
in : io five minutes you make it into bxcbllevt Soup — see

must obtain, and, (in spite of the Tiumberless Temptations, Sfc^ 
that daily offer to bend her from it,) preserve a character of 
spotless Integrity, and useful Industry +, remembering that it is 
the fair price of Independence, which all wish for, but none 
without it can hope for : only a Fool or a Madman will be so 
silly or so crazy, as to expect to reap, where he has been too 
idle to sow. 

Very few modern built Towo-houses have a proper place 
to preserve provisions in, the best substitute, is a Hanging- 
safe, which you may contrive to suspend in an airy situation, 
and when you order Meat, Podltrt w ¥iSB,iell the Trades^ 
^^-VfUlSk3^henyou intend to dress it, — he will then have it in his 
power to sSf^e^ou-wUh proviaion that wiU do him credit, 
which the finest Meat, &c. in the world, will never do, unless 
it has been kept a proper time to be ripe and tender. . 

If you have a welt-ventilated Larder, in a shady, dry situa- 
tion, you may make still surer, by ordering in your Meat and 
Poultry, such a time before you want it as will render it tender, 
which the finest meat cannot be, unless hung a proper time; 
(see 9d Chapter of the Rudiments of Cookery ;) according to 
the season and nature of the meat, &c., but always as ^^lesbons 
hommes de bouche de France^"* say it is " assez mortiJiSe,^^ 

Permitting this process to proceed to a certain degree, ren- 
ders meat much more easy of solution in the Stomach, and 

for those whose digestive facuUies are delicate, it is of the

KUchen Matd kept to wait upon them. 

There are many invalids who require a good Cook, and as (after readinr this Book 
Ihej will understand how much^ their comfort and elTecliTe existence dinends on 
their food being properly prepared, will willinglv pay handsome wages— (who would 
not rather pay the Cook than the Doctor 0— but haye so little work in the Kitchen 
—chat one person may do it all with the utmost ease, without ii\jury to their health, 
—which is not the case in a large family, where the poor (Cook is roasting and stew- 
ing all day— and is often deprived of her rest at night. No artists have greater need 
to ** make Hay while the Sun shines,*^ and timely provide for the infirmities of Age

Meat in which you can detect the slightest trace of putres- 
cency, has reached its highest degree of tenderness, and should 
be dressed without delay ; but before this period, which in 
some kinds of meat is offensive, the due degree of inte^eration 
may be ascertained, by its yielding readily to the pressure of 
the finger, and by its opposing little resistance to an attempt to 
bind the joint. 

Although we strongly recommend that Animal Food should 
be hung up in the open air, till its fibres have lost some degree 
of toughness — yet, let us be clearly understood, also to warn 
you — that if kept till it loses its natural sweetness — it is as de-

I have tdken muck more pains than any of my mrtdece$tar$f

in the RUDIMENTS of COOK£RY, i»be will beabU to 
execute the orders that are giveo her, with ease to hectelf^ and 
aaUsfactioB to her Employers, and aeod up a delicious dinner, 
with half the usual Expense and Trouble. 

I have endeavoured to lessen the labour of those who wish 
to be thoroughly acquainted with their profesaion ; and an a|- 
tentiTe perusal of the following pages will sara them much of 
the irksome drudgery attending an apprentioeahip at the atove ; 
an ordeal so severe, that few pass it without irreparable injury 
to their Health ; * and many lose their lives before they .learo 
their business. 

To encourage the best perforroanee of the machinery of Mas- 
tication, the Cook must take care that her Dinner ia not only 
well cooked— but that each dish be sent to table, with its proper 
accompaoimeots— in the neatest and most elegant manner. 

Remember that to excite the good opinion of the Eye ia the 
first step towards awakening the Appetite. 

Decoration is much more rationally employed, in rendering 
a plain wholesome nutritious dish inviting, than in the elaborate 
embellishments which are crowded about Trifles and Custards. 

Endeavour to avoid ovfr-dressing Roasts and Boils, Ac. and 
<n>er-se«soning Soups and Sauces, with Salt, Pepper^ &c. — ^it 
is afutUt which cannot he mended. 

If your Roasts, &c. are a little uncf^T^done ; with the assist- 
ance of the Stewpan, — the Gridiron, — or the Dutch Oven, — 
you may soon rectify the mistake made with the Spit or the 
Pot. 

If over-done, the best juices of the Meat are evaporated ,-« 
It will serve merely to distend the Stomach, and if the sensation 
of Hunger be removed, it is at the price of an Indigestion. 

The chief business of Cookery, is to render food easy of di- 
gestion — and to facilitate nutrition. This is most completely 
accomplished by Plain Cookery in perfection — i. e. neither 
over nor under^ione.

62 FRIENDLY ADVICE TO COOKS. 

With all your care, yoti will oot get macb credit by Cook- 
iog to perfection, if more tfaao One dish goes to table at a time,- 

To be eaten in perfection, the interval between Meat being 
taken out of the Stewpan, and its being put into the Mouth, 
must be shoe t at possible ; but Ceremony, that most formi- 
dable enemy to good Cheer, too often decrees it otherwise, and 
the Quests seldom get a bit of an *' EntremeV^ till it is half cold. 
(Set No. 485.) So much time is often tost in putting every 
tiling in Applepie order,— that long before Dinner is announc- 
ed, all becomes lukewarm, — and to complete the mortificatioa 
of the grand Gourmand^ his meat is put on a sheet of Ice in 
the shape of a Plate, which instantly converts the Qravy into 
Jelly, and the Fat into a something which puzzles his teeth and 
the roof of his mouth as much as if he bad Birdlime to mas- 
ticate : — a complete Meat Skreen will answer the purpose of a 
HoLdoset PUUe'tparmerj Sec, — See Index. 

It will save you infinite trouble and anxiety, if you can pre- 
vail on your employers to use the ** sauce box^^ (No. 463,) 
hereinafter described in the chapter of Sauces. With the help 
of this Magazine of Taste, every one in company may 
flavour their Soup and Sauce, and adjust the vibrations of their 
Palate, exactly to their own fancy : but if the Cook give a de- 
cidedly predominant, and fiquante gout tp a dish, to tickle the 
Tongue of two or three visitors, whose taste she knows — she 
may thereby make the Dinner disgusting to all the other guests. 

Never undertake more work than you are quite certain you 
can do well ; and if you are ordered to prepare a larger Dioner 
than you think you can send up with ease and neatoesi, or to 
dress any dish you are not acquainted with, rather than run any 
risk of spoiling any thing (for by one fault, you may perhaps 
lose all your credit) request your employer to let you have 
some help. They will acquit you for pleading guilty of ina-» 
iHlity— but if yo(| mi&ke ap attempt, and fMl* they may vote it 
a capital offence. 

Do not trust any part of your work to others without care- 
fully overlooking them ; whatever faults they commit. You 
will be censured for ; if you have forgotten any article which is 
indispensable for the day's dinner, request your employer te 
send one of the other servants for it. The Cook must never 
q[uit her Post, till her work is entirely finished.

would were you to deal with those who pretend to sell cheap-— 
but you will be more than io proportion better served. 

Ewry trade has its tricks and deceptions ; those who follow 
them can deceive you if they please, and they are apt to do so, 
if you provoke the exercise of their over-reaching talent.:): 

Challenge them to a game at *' CeUch who Can^'* by entirely 
relying on your own judgment : and you will soon find nothing 
but very long experience can make you equal to the combat of 
marketing to the utmost advantage. 

Before you go to Market, look over your Larder, and con- 
sider well what things are wanting — especially on a Saturday. 
No well-regulated family can suffer a disorderly caterer, to be 
jumping in and out to the Chandler's shop on a Sunday morning. 

Give your directions to your assistants, and begin your 
Business early in the Morning, or it will be impossible to have 
the Dinner ready at the time it is ordered. 

To be half an hour after the time, is such a frequent fault, 
that there is the more merit in being ready at the appointed 
hour. This is a difficult task, and in the best regulated family 
you can only be sure of your time by proper arrangements. 

With all our love of punctuality we must not forget that the 
first consideration must still be, that the Dinner '* be well done 
jjfv hen 'tis ^oi2e.'*-^If any accident GCCuFS, which is likelv to 
prevent your sending the Soup, &e. to table at the tnoment it is 
expected, send up a message to your employers, stating the cir- 
cttiusliiuce, and bespeak ibeir paueuce lor as many minutes c^ 
you think you shall want to be ready. This is better than 
either keeping the Company waiting without an apology ; cr 
dishing your Dinner before it is done enough, and so disgust- 
ing the Stomachs of the guests at the first appearance of it. 

Those who desire regularity in the service of their table, 
should have a DIAL of about twelve inches diameter, placed 
over the Kitchen fire-place, carefully regulated, to keep time 
exactly with ihe clock io the Hall or dining Parlour ; — with a

In one drawer under yoar Spicb-Box, keep, ready ground, 
tn welt stopped Bottles, the several spices separate; and aUa 
that mixture of them which is called '* Ragout Potcder : (No. 
457,) or (No. 460 ;)— in another keep your dried and powder- 
ed, Sweet Saroury, and Soup -herbs, &c. and a set of weights 
and scales :— yoo may have a third drawer, containing Fla- 
vouring Essences, Szc^ an invaluable auziliary in finishing 
soup6 and sauces : See the account of the ** Magazine omt 
Taste,** or " Sauce Box," (No. 483.) 

Have also ready some THicKENmo, made o the best white 
flour sifted, mixed with soft water with a wooden spoon till it 
is the consistence of thick batter ; a bottle of plain Brownihg 
(No. 32%) some strained Lemon-juice, and some good Glaze, 
or Portable Soup, (No. 262.) 

Nothing can be done in perfection^ that must he done in a 
Aurr^ /—therefore, if you wish the dinner to be sent up to 
please your Master and Mistress, and do credit to yourself, set 
a high value on your character for punctuality : this shows the- 
establishment is orderly, is extremely gratifying to the Master 
and his Guests, and is most praiiseworthy in the Attendants. 

But, remember, you cannot obtain this desirable reputation,, 
without good management in every respect ; if you wish to in- 
sure Ease and Independence in the latter part of your life, you 
must not be unwilling to pay the price for which only they can 
be obtained, and earn them by a dUigeni and faithfulX per- 
formance of the duties of your station in your young days, 
which, i/you steadily persevere in, you- may depend upon ulti- 
mately receiving th? reward your services deserve; 

All Duties are reciprocal ; and if you hope to receive favour,, 
endeavour to dieserve it by showing yourself fond of obliging, 
and grateful when obliged ; such Biebaviour will win regard 
and maintain it,enforce what ia right, and excuse what is wrong. 

Quiet steady Perseverance^s the only sure spring which yoa 
can- safely depend upon to infellibly promote your progress on 
tbe road to Independence..

TAbLE OP WEIGHTS AND MEASURES, 



To reduce our CuliDarjr Of •nilioat to as exact a oertaiuly, 
as tb» nature of the process, would admit of ;— we have, 
wbeniTer it was. aeedCiil, given the QuaDtities of each article. 

Thb Weights, are Avoirdupois. The MxA8i7B.8t — the 
grad^iated glass of the Apothecaries; this appeared the 
iQost accurate and coDYeoieat; — the Pint bdog divided' into 
sixteen ounces, the Ounce into eight drachms. A middiiog^ 
size Teaspoon will contain about a Drachm ; — fpur such Tea- 
spoons are equal to a middling size Tablespoon^ or half an 
Ounce ; — four Tablespoons to a common sized Wineglass. 

The specific gravities of the various substances, being so ex- 
tremely diflforent, we cannot offer any aoxiliary standard s+ for 
the WEIGHTS, which we earnestly recommend the Cook to em- 
ploy, if she wishes to gain credit for accuracy and uniformity 
in her business : these she will find it necessary to have as 
small as the quarter of a drachm Avoirdupois, which is equal 
to nearly seven grains Troy. 

Glass Measures, (divided into Tea, and Table-spoonSy) 
containing from Half an Ounce to Half a Pint, may be had at 
Price's, near Exeter 'Change, Strand : where also may be 
bad, — the double-headed pepper and spics-boxbs, with 
caps over 4be gratings. The superiority of these, by preserv- 
ing the cdntents from the action of the air, roust be sufficiently 
obvious to every one : the fine aromatic fiavour of Pepper is

RUDIMENTS OF COOKERY, 



CHAPTER I. 
BOILING. 



1 BIS most simple of Culiaary processes is aot often perform- 
ed in perfectioo,— 'it does uol require quite so much picety and 
attfiodance, as Roastiog, — to skim your pot well, aod keep it 
really boiUog (the slower the better) all the while, — to know 
how ioog 18 required for doing the joint, &c. and to uke it up, 
at ihe critictl n^oment when it is done enough, — comprehends 
almoel the whole art and mystery. This, however, demands a 
patient And per{)e4ttal vigilanee, of which fow persons are ca« 
pable. 

The Cook must take e&pedal care that the water realbf boils 
all the i^kib dvt k Cooinng, or ih& ^^ h deceived in the 
time ; and makeup asulRcient fire (a frugal Cook will manage 
with much less fire for Boiling than she uses ior roasting) at 
first, to last all the time, without much mending or stirmig. 

IVhen the Pot is coming to a boil, there will always* from 
tbe cleanest Meat and clearest Water, rise a Scum to the top 
of it : proceeding partly from the foulnesg of the meat, and 
partly from the water, — this must be carefully taken off as soon 
as it rise^ 

On this, depends tbe good appearance of all boiled things. 

When yott have scummed well, put in some cold water, 
which will throw up tlie rest of the scum. 

The ofteoer it is scummed, aod the cleaner the top of the 
Water is kept, tbe cleaner will be the Meat. 

If let alone, it soon boils dowa and sticks to the Meat ;+ 
which, instead of looking delicately white and nice,— -will have 
that coarse and filthy appearance we have too often to coo- 

t Iff unfortunately, thii thouid happen, the Cook muit carefully take it off when 
she duhes op, either with a cfeaa Sponge or a Paste-hnuh.

plain of, and the Butcher and Poulterer be blamed for the 
carelessoess of the Cook io not scumming her pot. 

Many put io Milky to make what they boil look while ; but 
this does more harm tbao good : — others wrap it up fa a cloth ; 
— but these are needless precautions ; if the scum be attentively 
removed, Meat will have a much more delicate colour and finer 
flavour than it has when muffled up. This may give rather 
more trouble — but Those who wiAh io excel in their Art must 
only consider how the processes of it can he most perfeetltf per* 
formed ; — a Cook who has a proper pride and pleasure in her 
business, will make this her maxim on all occasions. 

Put your Meat into co/J| water,— in the proportion of about 
a quart of Water to a pound of Meat :— it should be covered 
with water during the whole of the process of Boiling— but not 
drowned in H — the less water, provided the meat be covered 
with it,— the more Savoury will be the Meat, and the better 
will be the Broth. 

The fValer should he heated graduaUy—'Bccordiag to the 
thickness, &c. of the article boiled — for instance, a Leg of Mut- 
ton of 10 pounds weight, (No. J), should be placed over a 
moderate fire, which will gradually make theioater hot, vnthout 
causing it to hoit for ahout forty minutes — if the water boil 
much sooner, the meat will be hardened, and shrink up as if it 
was scorched — by keeping the water a certain time heating 
without boiling, its fibres are dilated, and it yields a quantity 
of scum, %btcb must be taken off as soon as it rises. 

** If a vessel containing water be placed over a steady Fire, 
the Water will grow continually hotter till it reaches the limit of 
boiling, after which the regular accessions of heat, are wholly 
spent in converting into Steam — the Water remains at the 
same pitch of temperature, however fiercely it boils. The only 
difference is, that with a strong fire it sooner comes to boil, and 
more quickly boils away, and is converted into Steam.'* 

The Editor placed a Thermometer in water in that state 
which Cooks call gentle simmering, — the heat was 212* — i,e. 
the same degree as ike strongest hoiling. Two Muttoit 
Chops were covered with cold water, — and one boiled a gallop 
and the other simmered gently for three quarters of an hour ;

the reason given— g«nUe ittwiof renden Meat, &e« tender, and still leaTcsit taptd

BOILING. 71 

tbe FlaTOur of the Chop which was simmered was decidedly 
4apenor to that which was boiled ; the Liquor which boiled 
last, was in lihe proportion more savoury, and, when cold, had 
much more fat on its surface : thi^ explains why quick boiling 
reoders meat bard. Sec. because its juices are extracted in a 
-greater degree. 

RECxoir THE Time from its first coming to a hoiL 
The old rule of 1 5 minutes to a pound of meat, we think 
rather too tittle ; the slower it boils, the tenderer, tbe plumper, 
and whiter it will be. 

For those who choose their Food thoroughly cooked, which 
all will who ba^e any regard for their Stomachs, Twenty 
Minutes to a Pound will not be found too much for gentle 
mnmering by the side of the fire ; allowing more or less time, 
aocordiog tO the thidcTtess of the Joint, and the coldneos of the 
Weather ; always remembering, the aluwer it boHs the better. , 

Without some practice it is difficult to teach any art ; and 
Cooks seem to suppose, they must be right, if they pot meat 
into a pot^ and set it over the fire for a certain time, — making 
no aUowanoe, whether it simmers without a bubble, or boils a 
gallop. 

Freih'kiUed Meat will take much longer time boiling thaa 
that which has been kept till it is what tbe butchers call np^,—- 
and longer in cold than in warm weather ; if it be frozen, it 
most be thawed before boiling as before roasting ;— <f it he 
fresh kUled it wUl be tough and hardf if you stew it ever so 
long^ andjever so gently. In cold weather, the night before 
the day you dress it, bring it into a place of which the tempera- 
ture is not less than 45 degrees of Fahrenheit's thermometer. 

The Size of the Boilino Pots should be adapted to what 
they are -to contain : the larger the saucepan, the more room it 
takes upon tbe fire, and a larger quantity of Water requires a 
proportionate increase of Fire to boil it. 

In Small Families, we recommend BLOCK TIN sauce- 
par, s, ^c. as lightest, and safest ;— if proper care is taken of 
jthem, and they are well dried after they are cleaned, they are 
by far the cheapest ; tbe purchase of a new Tin saucepan be- 
ing little more than the expense of tinning a Copper one. 

Take care that the Covers of your boiling pots fit close, 
not only to prevent unnecessary eraporation of the water, but 



73 BOILING. 

that the smoke may not insinuate ftself ander the edge of the 
lid, and give the meat a bad taste. 

If you let meat or poultry remain in the water after it is done 
enoqgh,.it will become sodden and lose ita flavoor. 

Beef and Mutton a little uniier-done (especially ^ery large 
joints, which will make the better Hash or Broil,) is not a great 
fault ; by some people it is preferred ; but Lam6, Pork, and 
Vealf are uneatable if not thoroughly boiled— ^but do not over- 
do them. 

A Tritbt, or Fish drainer put on 'the bettom of the boiling 
Pot, raising the contents about an inch and a half from the bot- 
tom, will prevent that aide of the meat "which comes next the 
bottom from being done too much, — and the lower part of the 
meat will be as delicately done as tbeother part ; and this will 
enable you to take out the contents of the Pot without sticking 
a fork, Sfo. into it. If you have not a trivet, use four Skawen, 
or a Soup-plate laid the wrong side upwards. 

Take care of the Liquor you have boiled Poultry or Meat 
in ; in Five Minutes you may make it into EZcstLBirT Soup ; 
see Obs. to (No. 555) and (No. 239.) 

The GOOD Housewife never boils a Joint without eonYort- 
ing the Broth into some sort of Soup, (Read No. 5 and chap* 
ter 7, and see page 57.) If the Liquor be too salt, only use 
half the quantity, and the rest water ;— ^wash Salted meat well 
with cold water before you put it into the boiler. 



4n tdimatian of the Loss of Wiioht which takes place in Cookii^ 
jMnuU Food, From Mr. Tillocb*s Philotophical Magasine. 

** It is well known that, in whatever way the flesh of animals ia 
prepared for food, a considerable diminution takes place in its 
weight. We do not recollect, however, to have seen any where a 
statement of the loss which meat sustains in the various culinary pro- 
cesses, although it is pretty obvious that a series of experiments on 
this subject would not be without their use in domestic economy. 

« We shall here give the result of a series of experiments which 
were actually made on this subject in a public establishment ; pre- 
mising that, as they were not undertaken from mere curiosity, but, 
on the contrary, to serve a purpose of practical utility, absolute ac- 
curacy was not attended to. Considering, however, the large quan- 
tities of provisions which were actually examined, it is presumed that 
the results may be safely depended upon for any practical purpose. 
It would no doubt have been desirable to have known not only the 
whole diminution of weight, but also the parts which were separated

from the meat in the form of aquecmi vapour, jeDjr, fkt, be. but the 
determination of these ^d not fall virlthin the scope of the enqorj.

" We shall only draw two practical inferences from the fbregoinr 
statement. Ist. In respect of economy, it is more pro6table to boil 
meat than to roast it. 2d. Whether we roaft or ;boil meat, it loses 
by being cooked, from ene-fiflh to one-third of its whole weight.** 

The loss in Roasting arises fitNfe the melting out of the 
Fat* and evaporating the water : but tbe nutntioirs matten re- 
TDaio condensed in the cooked solid. 

In Boiling, the loss arises partly from the fat melted oof,; 
but chiefly from GeUUine and Osmazome being extracted and 
dissolved by the water in which the meat is boiled ; there ie, 
therefore, a real loss of aoiiriahiuent unless tbe Broth be used i 
— when this mode of cooking becomes the most economical.

BAKING. 



The following Observations were given to us by a respecta- 
ble Baker. 

Baking is one of the cheapest, and roost convenient ways of 
dressing a Dinner in small families ; and I may say that the 
Oven is often the only Kitchen a poor man hasy if he wishes to 
enjoy a joint of Meat at home with his family. 

I don't mean to deny the superior excellence of Roasting to 
Baking ; but some joints, when Baked, so nearly approach to 
the same when Roasted, that I have known them to be carried 
to the Table, and eaten as such with great satisfaction. 

Legs, and Loins of Pork; Legs of Mutton; Fillets 
of Veal ; and many other joints, will Bake to great advan- 
tage if the meat be good ; I mean well fed, rather inclined to 
be fat ; if the meat be poor, no Baker can give satisfaction. 

When baking a joint of poor meat, before it has been half 
baked, I have seen it start from the bone, and shrivel up scarce- 
ly to be believed. 

Besides those Joints above mentioned, T shall enumerate a 
few Baked dishes, which I can particularly recommend. 

A Pig, when sent, to the Baker prepared for baking should 
have its Ears and Tail covered with buttered paper properly 
fastened on, and a bit of Butter tied up in a piec^ of line to 
baste the back with, otherwise it will be apt to blisters with a 
proper share of attention from the Baker, I consider this way 
equal to a roasted one.

BAKING. 75 

A Goose prepared the same as for roasting, taking care to 
haire it on a stand, and wbeo half done, to turn the other side 
upwards. A Duck the same. 

A Buttock of Beep the foUowiug way is particularly 6ne. 
After it has been in salt about a week, to be well washed and 
put into a brown earthen pan with a pint of water ; cover the 
pan tight over with two or three thicknesses of cap or foolscap 
Paper ; never cover any thing that is to be baked with Brown 
paper, the pitch and tar that is in brown paper will give the 
meat a snooky bad taste— give it four or five hours itt a moder- 
ate heated oven. 

A Ham (if not too old) pot in soak for an hour, taken out 
and wiped, a crust made sufficient to cover it all over, and bak- 
ed in a moderate heated oven ; cuts fuller of gravy, and of a 
£ner flavour than a boiled one. I have been in the habit of 
baking small Cod-fish, Haddock, and Mackerel,, with a 
dost of flour, and some bits of butter put on them. Eels, when 
large and stuffed. Herrings and Sprats, in a brown pan, 
with vinegar and a little spice, and tied over with paper. A 
Hare, prepared the same as for Hoasting, with a few pieces of 
Butter, and a little drop of Milk put into the dish, and Basted 
several times, will be found nearly equal to roasting ; or cot it 
up, season it properly, pot it into a jar or pan, and cov«f it 
over and bake it in a moderate oven for about three hours.-— In 
tlie same manner, I have been in the habit of baking Legs and 
Shins of Beef, Ox Cheeks, &c. prepared with a seaaoniag 
of Onions, Turnips, &c. : they will take about four hours : let 
them stand till cold to skim off the fat ; then warm it ap all 
together, or part, as you may want it. 

All these I have been in the habit of baking for the first fam- 
ilies. 

The time each of the above articles should take, depSMs 
much upon, the state of the Oven, and J do consider the Baker 
a sufficient judge ; — if they are sent to him in time, he must be 
very neglectful, if they are not ready at the time they are or- 
dered.

RUDIMENTS OF COOKERY. 



CHAPTER II. 
ROASTING. 



In all studies, it is the best practice to begin with the plainest 
and easiest parts ; and so on, by degrees, to such as are more 
ciifficiiit : we, therefore treated of plain Boiling, and we now 
proceed to Roasting : — we shall then gradually unravel, to our 
Culinary students, the Art, (and mystery^ until developed in 
this work) of making with the least trouble and expense, the 
most highly finished Made-dishes. 

Let the young Cook never forget, thai Clbanlinbssisi the 
ckhi (Cardinal Virtue of the Kitchen ; — the first preparation for 
Roasting is to take care that the Spit be properly cleaned with 
sand and water ; nothing else. When it has been well scour* 
ed with this, dry it with a clean cloth. If Spits arc wiped clean, 
as soon as the meat is draumfrom tkem^ and while they are hot, 
a very Utile cleaning wiil he required* The less the Spit is pas- 
ed through the meat the better*, and before you spit it, joint 
it joreper/i/— especially necks and loins-— that the Carver may 
separate them easily and neatly, and take especial care it be 
evenly balanced on the spit, that its motion may be regular, 
and the fire operate equally on each part of it ; — therefore, be 
provided with Balancing Skewers, and Cookholds, and see 
it is properly Jointed. 

* Small families have notalwayt the coDvenieace of roattiiir with a SptC,--a re- 
mark upon roatting by a Hring is neeesiary. Let the Cook, 6e^r« she puts her meat 
down to the fire, pasaa strour skewer through each end^f the joint : by this meant, 
when it is about half done* she ean with ease turn the bottom upwards ; the gravy 
will then flow to the part wUieh has. been uppermost, and the whole joim be de- 
lieiously graTy-fuU. 

A Btttle-Jack^n it is tenoed by the furnishing ironmongers, is a ▼aluable instru- 
ment for roasting.

pose, called '^ Kitchen Paper/' and tie it on with fine twin«; 
phis and skewers can by no means be allowed, the j are so maoy 
taps, to lei out the Gravy : besides, the paper often starts 
from them and catches fire to the great injury of the meat. 

If the thing to be roasted be thin and tender, the fire should 
be little and brisk ; when you have a large joint to roast, make 
up a sound, strong fire, equally good, in every part of the grate 
— H>r your meat cannot be equally roasted, nor have that uniform 
colour which constitutes the beauty of good roasting. 

Give the Fire a good stirring before you lay the joint down ; 
examine it from time to time, while the spit is going round ; 
keep it clear at the bottom, and take care there are no smoky 
coals in the front, which will spoil the look and taste of the 
meat, and hinder it from roasting evenly. 

When the joint to be roasted, is thicker at one end than the 
other, place the spit slanting, with the thickest part nearest the 
fire« 

Do not put Meat too near the fire at first ; the larger the 
joint the farther it must he kept from the Fire ;— if once it 
gels scorched, the outside will become hard, and acquire a dis- 
Bgreeable empyreumatic taste; and the fire being prevented 
from penetrating into it, the meat will appear done, before it is 
little more thbn half done, besides losing the pale brown colour, 
which it is the Beauty of Roasted meat to have. 

From 14 to 10 inches is the usual distance at which meat is 
put from the grate, when first put down : it is extremely diflB- 
cult to offer any thing like an accurate general rule for this, — it 
depends so much upon the size of the fire, and of that of the 
thing to be roasted. 

Till some Culinary Philosopher shall invent a Thermometer 
to ascertain the heat of the Fire, and a graduated Spit-Rack 
to n»g«i!ate the disunce from it, the process of Roasting is at- 
tended by so many ever-varying circumstances, that it must re- 
main among those which can only be performed well, by fre- 
quent practice and attentive observation. 

** Mr. Watt, for his Steam Engines where Wood fuel is em- 
ployed, allows three times the Weight of Wood, that he does 
of Newcastle CoaJs— -and a bushel of Ncwcoatle Coals, which 



ROASTIKQ* 79 

weighs ^ of a Cwt. ia reckoned to produce as mach hflit as a 
Gwt. of Scottish or Glasgow CoaV* 

If you wish your Jack to go well, keep it as clean as possi- 
ble, oil it aod then wipe it ; if the oil is not wiped off again, it 
will gather dust ; to prevent this, as soon as you have done 
roasting, cover it up. — ^Never leave the winders on whilst the 
Jack is going round, unless you do it, as Swift says, **that it 
may fly off, and knock those troublesome servaints on the head 
who will be crowding round your Kitchen fire.'' 

Be very careful to place the Drippino-Pan at such a drstance 
from the fire, as just to catch the drippings: if it is too near» 
the ashes will fall into it, and spoil the Drippings* (which we 
shall hereafter show, will occasionally be found an excellent 
substitute for Butter or Lard ;) — To clarify Drippingi^ see 
"No. 83, and Peate and Dripping Soup^ No. 229 (savourif and 
sabuhrwwi for only a Penny per Quart.) If it is too far 
from the fire to catch them, you will not only lose your drip- 
pings, but the meat will be blackened, aod spoiled by the foetid 
smoke, which will arise when the fat falls on the live cinders. 

Tke time Meat iviU take Roasting will vary according to the 
time it has been kept, and the temperature of the weather :— 
the same weightf will be twenty minutes, or half an hour long- 
er in Cold fVeather^t ^han it will be in warm-r-and if fresh 
kiHedf than if it has been kept till it is tender. Cooks seldom- 
calculate according to the variation of temperature, &c, 

A good Meat Screen, is a great saver of Coals. It should 
be on wheels, have a flat top, and not be less than about three 
feet and a half wide, and with shelves in it, about one foot 
deep— it will then answer all the purposes of a large Dutch 
oven, Plate Warmer, Hot Hearth, &c. Some are made with a 
Door behind — this is covenient — but the great heat they are 
exposed to soon shrinks the materials, and the current of air 
through the cracks cannot be prevented — so they are better 
without the Door.

en the inght before, or early in the nMurning of the day you want to roast it, and the 
man air witl thaw it much better. 



80 ROASTING* 

Every body knows the advaota^ of Saw BoUing-^uoir 
Roasting is equally important. 

It is difficult to give aoy specific Rule for Time; — but if 
your Fire is made as before directed, — your Meat S€reen suf- 
ficiently large to guard what you are dressing from currents of 
Air, — and the meat is not Frosted, — you cannot do better, 
than follow the old general rule of allowing rather more than a 
Quarter tf an hour to the Pound ; a little more or less, ac- 
cording to the temperature of the weather, — and in proportion 
as the piece is thick or thin,-— the strength of the Fire, — the 
nearness of the Meat to it, — and the frequency with which you 
baste it ; the more it is basted, the less time it will take, as it 
keeps the Meat soft and mellow on the outside, and the Fire 
acts with more force upon it. 

Rechon the TVme, not to the hour when Dinner is ordered 
— but to the moment the Roasts will be wanted— eupposing 
there are a dozen people to sip Soup and eat Fish first : you 
may allow them ten or fifteen minutes £or the former, and 
about as long for the latter, more or less, Recording to the temp- 
tations the *' BoN Goct" of these preceding courses has to 
attract their attention. 

When the Joint is halfdone^ remove the Spit and Dripping 
Pan back, and stir up your fire thoroughly, that it may burn 
clear and bright for the Browning : — when the steam from the 
Meat draws towards the fire,* it is a sign of its being done 
enough; but you will be the best judge of that, from the time 
it has been down, the strength of the Fire you have used, and 
the distance your Spit has been from it. 

Half an hour before your Meal i$ done^ make someGRAvr, 
(No. 326) and just before you take it up, put it nearer the fire 
to brown it. If you wish to froth it, — baste it, and dredge 
it with flour carefully ; you cannot do this delicately nice, with' 
oui a very good light ; the common fault seems to be using too 
much flour ; the Meat should have a fine light varnish of 
Froth ; not the appearance of being covered with a paste;—

A Good Cook is as anxiously attentive to the appearance 
and Colour of her Roasts, as a Court Beauty is to her Com- 
plexion at a Birthday Ball. 

Though roasting is one of the most common, and is generally 
considered one of the most easy and simple processes of Cook- 
ery, — it requires more unremitting attention to perform it per- 
fectly well, than it does to make most Made-dishes. 

That Made-dishes are the most difficult preparations, de- 
serves to be reckoned among the Culinary Vulgar Errors ;— 
in Piam Roasting and Boiling, it is not easy to repair a mistake 
once made;*-<aiid all the discretion and attention of a steady 
careful Cook, must be nnremittingiy upon the alert.* 



*A eehhratodFreneh writer has iriTen the (MMtirfDf obMiv»tian» «n roatti^f :«» 
** The Art of RoattiBf Tietuals to the precise degree, is one of Uie roott difficult In 
this world, aiMl ynt may Jtnd half a tnoutand gSti C—kt tooner than one perfect 
Roaster* In the mansions of the opulent they have besides the Master Kitchener.— 
a Boaster, (perfeatly independent of the former) who is exclusively devoted to the 
Spit. 

" AU erudite Gourmand know that these two important functions cannot be pei^ 
Ibrmed by one artist : it U quite impossible, at the same time tu superintend the op- 
erations of the Spit and the Stewpan." — Further on the same author observes : ** No 
certain rules can be given for Roasting, the perfection of it depending on many eir- 
comstanees which are continually changing ; the age and size especially the thiek- 
nessof the pieces, the quality of the coals and temfteiature of the atmosphere, the 
current of air in the kitchen, the more or less attention of the roaster ; and. lastly, 
the time of servings—Supposing the Dinner ordered to be on table at a certain time 
if the Fish and Soup are much liked, and detained longer than the roaster has caJea* 
lated ; or. on the contrary, if they are despatched sooner than is expected, the iMsta 
will in one case he burnt up, in the other not done enough — two mufortunes equally 
to he deplored. The first, Ibowever, is without r^aedy ; fpoe minuue on the Spit^ 
mere or leu, decide* the goodneet of this mode of Cookery ;— it is almost imposnhle to 
seize the precise instant when it ought to be eaten; which Epicures in roasts tsr 
press, by saying, * It is done to a turn,"* So that there is no exaggenitioji in iaying« 
the perfect Roaster, is even more rare^than the professed eook. 

** In small fhmilia, where the Cook is also the Roastef.-^it is almost impossible tte 
roasts should be well done ;— -the Spit cfaims exclusive attention, and is an imperious 
Mistress, who demands the entire devotion of her shive. But how can this he? 
When the Cook is obliged at the same time, to attend her Fish and Soup ketdes, 
and watch her Stewpansandall their aeeompanimenu i— 4tis morally and frfiyueally 
impossible, if she gives that delicate and constant attention to the Roasts, which is 
indispensaoly requisite, the rest of the Dinner must often be spoilt; and most Cooks 
would rather lose their character as a Roaster than neglect the made-dishes and ^ «n- 
tremel*,* Sec. where they think they can display their Culinary •Sctence^— than sacri- 
fice these to the Roasts, the perfection of which, will only prove their steady Viei- 
lance and Faience.** ^ t . . 7 ^

CHAPTER III. 

FRYING. 

F&TiNO is often a ooovenieot mode of Cookery, — it may be 
performed by a fire which will not do for Roasting or Broiling i 
and by the introduction of the Pan between the Meat and the 
Fire, things get more equally dressed. 

The Dutch Oven or Bonnbt is another very convenient 
iitenn\ for small things, and a yery useful substitute for the 
Jack, tbe Giidiron, or Fryingpan. 

A Frtinopan should be about four inches deep, with a 
perfectly flat and thick bottom^ \*i inches long, and broad-— 
with perpendicular sides, and must be half filled with Fat. 
Goon Frtihg is, in fact. Boiling in Fat, To make sure thai 
the Pan i$ quite dean^ rub a little Fat over it— and then make 
it warm and wipe it out with a clean cloth. 

Be very particular in Frying, never to use any Oil, Butter, 
Lard, or Drippings, but what is quite clean, fresh, and free 
from salt. Any thing dirty spoils the look ; — any thing bad 
tasted or stale spoils the flavour; — and salt prevents its Brown- 
ing. 

Fine Olive Oi2, is the most delicate for frying ; — but to have 
the best oil is very expensive, and bad oil spoils every thing 
that is dressed with it. 

For general purposes, and especially for Fish, dean fresh 
JLard is not near so expensive as oil or clarified Butter, aud 
does almost as well, except for Cutlets and (Jollops. Butter 
often burns before you are aware of it, and what you fry will 
get a dark and dirty appearance. 

Cooks in large kitchens, where there is a great deal of ffying, 
commonly use Mutton or Beef Suet^ clarified, No. 84 ; if from 
the kidney, all the better. 

Drippings if nicely clean and fresh, is almost as good as any 
thing, — if not clean, it may be easily clarified ; see No. 83. 






S4 , TRTING. 

Whatever Fat you use, after you have done frying, let it re« 
main in tiie Pan for a few minutes, and then pour it through a 
sieve into a clean basin— i< will do three or four limes as weU 
a$ it did aJt firsts i. e. if it has not burned — but Jdem^ the Fat 
you have fried Fish in must not be used for any other purpose. 
To know when the Fat is of |i proper heat, according to 
what you are to fry, is the great secret in frying. 

To fry FrsH, Parslbt, Potatoes, or any thing watery, 
your Fire mxat he very clear and your Fai quite Ao£,— which 
you may be pretty sure of, when it is done hissing, and is still. 
-»We cannot insist too strongly on this point : — if the Fai ii 
not very hot^ you cannot fry Fish either to a good colour ^ or 
firm ofnd crisp. 

To be quite certain, — throw a little bit of Bread into the 
pan ; if it fries crisp, the Fat is ready : if it burns the bread, it 
is too hot. 

2%e Fire under the pan must he clear and sharps otherwise 
the fat is so long before it becomes ready, and demands such 
attendance to prevent the accident of its catching fire,* the pa« 
tience of cooks is exhausted, and they frequently, from igno- 
rance, or impatience, throw in what they are going to fry, be- 
fore the fat is half hot enough. Whatever is so fried, will be 
pale and sodden, and offend the Palate and Stomach, not less 
than the Eye. 

Have a good light to fry hy^ that you may see when you 
have got the right colour : a Lamp fixed on a stem with a 
loaded foot, which has an arm that will lengthen out, and slide 
up and down like a reading candlestick, is a most useful ap^ 
pendage to Kitchen Fireplaces^ which are very seldom light 
enough for the nicer operations of Cookery. 

After all, if you do not thoroughly drain the Fat from what 
you havefriedy especially Irom those things that are full dressed 
in Bread-crumbSff &c. — your Cooking will do you no credit 



* If this asfortumtdy bappeiit, be not in the letfst alarmed, bat immediatelr wet 
a baakec of Ashei and throw them down Uie Cbimnej, and wet a BlanlEet, ana hold 
it elow all round the Fir^•plaee,— as loon as the earrent of wind is stooped.— the 
Fire will be extinfuisbed : wiili a CharcMl Sttne there is no danfer, as the diame- 
ter of the Pan exceeds that of the fire. 

t When yoQ want a great many Bread'Crtambt^ divide yoar Loaf into three equal 
parU— take the middle or cmmb-pieee— the top and bottom will do for table — ^in the 
usual way of cutting the erust is wasted. 

Oatmeal is a very satisfhetory, and an eztiemely eeonomieal Sobttitute for Brew- 
Crumbt. See No. 14C.

RUDIMENTS OF COOKERY. 



CHAPTER IV, 
BROILNO. 



CLBAKUNBai is extremely esseotial in this mode of cookery. 

Keep your Gridiron quite clean between the bars, and 
bright on the top ; when it is hot, wipe it well with a linen 
doth ; just before you use it, rub the bars with clean mutton 
suet, to prevent the Meat from being marked by the gridiron. 

Take care to prepare your Fire in time, so that it may bnm 
quite clear ; a hruk and dear fire ib tndupensa62e ; or you 
cannot give your meat that browning which constitutes the per- 
lection of this mode of cookery, and gives a relish to food it 
cannot reoeire any other way. 

Be Tery attentive to watch the moment any thing is done ; 
never hasten any thing that is broiling, lesf you should smoke 
and spoil it. 

Let the bars of the Gridiron be all hot through, but yet not 
burning hot upon the surface ;— this is the perfect and fine con- 
dition of the Gridiron. 

As the bars keep away as much beat as their breadth covers, 
it is absolutely necessary they sboald be thoroughly hot before 
the thing to be cooked be laid on them. 

The Bare of Gridirom should be made concave, and termi- 
nate in a trough to catch the Gravy and keep the Fat from 
dropping into the fire and making a smoke, which will spoil 
the Broil. 

Upright Gridirons are the best as they can be used at 
any fire, without fear of smoke ; and the gravy is preserved ia 
the trough under them. 

N. B. Broils must be brought to table ae Hot as possible : 
set a Dish to heat when you put your Chops on the Gridiron — 
from whence to the Mouth their progress must be as quick as 
possible. 

When the fire is not clear "the business of the Gridiien 
may be done by the Dutch Oven or Bonnet. 

See Appendix, p. 366.

CHAPTER V. 
VEGETABLES. 



There is TwOdng in which the difference between an Elegant 
and an Ordinary table is more seen, than in the dressing of 
Vegetahles, more especially of Greeos :— «tbey may be equally 
aafiDe at first, at one place as at another; but therr look and 
taste are afterwards very different, entirely froio the careless way 
in wbkh they have been cooked. 

They are in greatest perfection when in greatest plenty, i, e, 
when in full season. 

By Season,— I do not mean those early days, that luxury in 
the 6tt2^er3, and avarice in the sellers about London, force the 
various vegetables : but that time of the year in which by na- 
ture and common culture, and the mere operation of the Sun 
and Climate, they, are in most plenty and perfection. 

UsaiPB Yeobtables, are as insipid and unwholesome as 
Unripe Fiiiits^ 

As to the quality of Vegetable^ the middle size are prefer- 
red to the largest or the smallest ; — they are more tender, juicy, 
and full of flavour, just before they are quite full grown. Fresh- 
0658 is their chief value and excellence, and I should as soon 
think of roasting an Animal alive, as of boiling a Vegetable af- 
ter it is dead. 

The Eye easily discovers if they have been kept too long ; 
they soon lose their Beauty iu all respects. 

cots, Greens, Salads, &c. and the various productions of 
Grarden, when first gathered, are plump and firm, and have 
grant freshness no art can give them again, when they have 
it by long keeping ; — though it will refresh them a little to 
them into cold spring water for some time before they are 
«ed. 



88 VEGBTABLfiS. 

• 

To boi) them in wfi vxiter will preserTa the colour best of 
such as ere Green ; if you have only hard water, put to it a 
tettspoooful oi Curi>onate 0/ Potask, 

Take care to voash and cleanse them thoroughly from dusti 
dirt, and iusects : thin rehires gretU aUention : pick oflTall the 
outside leaves, trim them nicely, and if not ^ite fresh gathered 
and have become flcccid»*«-it is absolutely necessary to restore 
their crispness before cooking them, or they will be tough and 
unpleasant : lay them in a pan of clean water, with a handful of 
salt in it, for an hour before you dress them. 

** Most Vegetables being more or less succulent, their full 
proportion of 6uids is neeessary for their retaining that state 
of cri^neaa and plumpness which they have when j^row* 
itig. On being out or gaibtredi the eJcbaUtion from their sur^ 
face eontiniMs» while from the open ▼eseela of the out eurfiMsei 
there is often great exudation or efaporation, and Ihos their 
natural moisture is diminished, the tender leaves heeome flae- 
eid, and the thicker masses or roots lose their plumpness. This 
is not only less pleasant to the Eye, but is a real >^ur]r to the 
nntritioos powers of the Tegetable : for ia this naeeid and 
shrirelled state its fibres are less easily divided in chewing^ 
and the water which exists in ▼egetabie substancee, in the form 
of their respective natural juices, is directly nutricious. The 
first care in the preservation of succulent vegetables, therefore, 
is to prevent them from losing their natural moisture/* — Sup, 
to Edinb. Encydop, 

They should always be boiled in a saucepan by themselves, 
and have plenty of water : if Meat is boiled with them in the 
same pot, they will spoil the look and taste of each other. 

If you wish to have Vegetables delicately clean, put on your 
Pot, make it boil, put a little salt in it — and skim it perfectly 
clean before you put in the Greens, Ssc. — which should not be 
put in till the water boils briskly : the quicker they boil, the 
greener they will be ; when the Vegetables sink, they are gen- 
erally done enough, if the water has been kept constantly boil- 
ing. Take them up immediately j or they wilU lose their colour 
and goodness. Drain the water from them thoroughly before 
you send them to table. 

This branch of Cookery requires the most vigilant attention. 

If Vegetables are a minute or two too long over the Fire, 
they lose all their Beauty and Flavour.

To preserve, or give colour in Cookery, many good disbat 
are spoiled ; but the rational Epicure, who makes oonnibvieDt 
the main end of eating, will be content to sacrifice the shadow, 
to enjoy the substance. Vide Obs, to Na 3^% 

Once for all, take care your vegetables are fresh ; for as tite 
Fishmonger often suffers tor the sins of the Cook, so the Cook 
often gets undeservedly blamed instead of the Green-grocer. . 

** Succulent Vegetables are best preserved in a cool shady 
and damp- place. Potatoes, Turnips, Carrots, and similar 
Roots intended to be stored up, should never be cleaned from 
the earth adhering to them*— and must be protected from the 
action of the air, and frost, by laying them in heaps, burying 
them in sand or earth, &c. covering them with straw or mats. 

'^ The action of Frost destroys the life of the Vegetable, and 
it speedily rots.*'— Sup. to Edm6. Encychpedia. 

N. & When Greens, Sfc are quite fresh gathered^ they will 
not require so much boiling, by at least a third of the time they 
take, when they have been gathered the usual time those ara 
that are brought to public markets. 

Mr. Appert hag published his simple and unexpensive pro- 
cess of preserving fresh, both animal and vegetable foods, from 
the season of produce, through the season of scarcity, in their 
full flavour and excellence, merely by applying heat in a due 
degree to the several sobttanees, after having deprived them of 
all contact with the external air. 

There is not a Mistress of a Family who is rich enough to 
lay by a stock of these Articles, and not too rich to despise 
Economy, who will not be benefitted by the perusal of Mr.

FISH. 

Tais departmeot of the business of the Kitchen reqairev 
considerable experience, and depends more upon practice than 
any other ;— a very few moments^ more or less will thoroughly 
spoil Fish f ; which to be eaten in perfection,— 'mast never be 
put on the Table, till the Soup is taken off. 

So many circumstances operate on thisoccasion^.it is almost 
impossible to write general rules. 

There are decidedly difl^nt opinions, whether Fish should 
be put into cold, tepid, or boiling water. 

We beliere for some of the fame the Dutch Cooks have ac« 
qnired they are a little indebted to their situation, affordiog 
them a plentiful bupply of Fresh Fish for little more than the 
trouble of catching it :~and that the superior excellence of the' 
fish in Holland, is because none are used, unless they are 
brought alive into the Kitchen, (Mackerel excepted, which die 
the moment they are taken out of the water.) The Dutch are as 
nice about this, as Seneca says the Romans % were ; who, 

t When the Cook hat large diUMn to piCMre and the tioie of wrvinf aneertain* 
•he will gtt more opedit hj Fritt^ (No. lif^ or slewed, (No. 104,) than by Boikd 
Fish. 

Mr. Ude, page 238 of his Codtary, advises, ** If yon are obKjeed to wait after ^ 
Fish is done, do not let it remain in the water, but keep the water Doilinr, and put the 
^sh over it, and eorer it wich a damp eloth— when the dinner is called for, dip the

Od the Dutch flat coast, the Fish are taken with nets ; on 
our rocky coast tbey are mostly caught by bait and hook, 
which instantly kills tbenu Fish are brought alive by land, to 
the Dutch markets, in waier-casks with air holes in the top.-~ 
Salmon, and other fish are thus preserved in rivers, in a well- 
hole, in the fishing-boat. 

Fish of evert kind are best some time before they be« 
gin to spawn— and are unfit for food for some time after they 
have spawned. 

The most convenient Utejuil to boil Pish yVi, is a Turbo r- 
Kettlb,-— this should be %4 inches long, 29 wide, and 9 deep. 
It is an excellent vessel to boil a Ham in, Sue. &c« 

The good folks of this Metropolis are so often disappointed, 
by having Fish which have been kept too long, — that they aro 
apt io run into the other extreme, and suppose that Fish will 
not dress well, unless it is absolutely alive. This is true of Iiob« 
sters, &c. (No. 176) and may be of Fresh water fish, but cer- 
tainly not of some Sea Fish. 

Several respectable Fishinongers and experienced Cooks 
have assured the Editor, that they are often in danger of losing 
their credit, by fish too fresh, and especially Turbot and C^, 
which, like Meat, require a certain time before they are io the 
best condition to be dressed :-— they recommend them to be put 
into Cold f^ateVf SaUed in proportion of about a quarter of a 
pound of salt to a gallon of water,-- -Sea fVater is best to boil 
Sea fish in,— and let them boil slowly till done ; the sign of 
which kf that the skin of the Fish rises up, and the Eyes turn 
white.

If a servant has the misfortune to scorch or blister the tir^

94 BROTHS AND SOUPS, 

or any bad smeU tbey may have got since tbey were last used : 
never neglect ibis. 

Though we do not suppose our Cook to be such a naughty 
Slut, as to wilfully neglect her Broth Pots, Sec, yet we oiay 
recommend her to wash them immediately^ and take care they 
are thoroughly dried before the fire, before they are pot by, 
and to keep them in a dry place^for damp will rust and de- 
stroy them very soon : attend to this the first moment you can 
spare after the dinner is sent up : never put by any jSoup, Gnr 
wj^Sbc, in a metal utensil; in which, never Iteep any thtog 
longer than is absolutely necessary for the purposes of Cookery, 
the acid, vegetables, and fat, &c. employed in making them 
are capable of dissolving them ; therefore stone or earthen ves- 
selsshould be used for this purpose. 

Stbwpavs and Sovp*pots, with thick and round bottoms, 
(such as saucepans are made with) will wear twice as long, and 
are cleaned with half the trouble, as those whose sidea are 
soldered to the bottom, of which Sand and Grease get into 
the joined parti and it is next to an impossibility, to dislodge 
it. The ifiditor claims the credit of having first suggested the 
importance of this construction of these utensils. 

Take care that the Lids fit as close as possible, that the 
Broth, Soup, and Sauces, &c* may not waste by evaporation* 
They are good for nothing, unless they fit tight enough to keep 
the Steam in, and the Smoke out. 

Stewpans and saucepans should be always bright on the up- 
per rim where the fire does not burn them : but to scour them 
all over,is not only giving the Cook needless trouble, but wear- 
ing out the vessels. 

Cultivate habits of regularity and cleanliness, &c. in all your 
business, which you will then get through easily and comfort- 
ably. I do not mean the .restless spirit of Molidusta^ *' the Ti" 
dy Onty* who is always frisking about, in a whirlpool of bustle 
and confusion ; and is always dirty, under pretence of being 
always cleaning. 

Lean juicy Beef,— Mutton, — or Veal, — form the basis of 
Broth: — procure those pieces which afford the most and he 
richest succulence, and as fresh killed as possible^. See Tbe 
Marketing-Tablbs at the end of this work.

ter, in (No. ^29,) that Fat and Clarified Drippings may be so 
conibined with Vegetable Mucilage, as to afford, at the small 
•ost of ONE Penny per Quart, a nourishiog, aod palateable 
Soap, faily adequate to satisfy Appetite, aod support strength : 
this will open a new source to those beoevoleot boosekeeperSt 
who are disposed to relieve the Poor, — and show the iodos* 
trioQS classes how much they hare it in their power to assist 
themselves, and rescue them from being objects of Charity d^- 
pendent on the precarious bounty of ol]bers,<— by teaching them 
how to obtain a cheap, abundant, salubrious, and agreeable all* 
ment for themselves and families. 

Th\s Soup has the advantage of being very easily and very 
soon made, with no more fuel than is necessary to warm a room 
—those who have not tasted ft, cannot imagine what a salobri- 
oas, savoury and satisfying Meal is produced by the jndieioQS 
eombinatioo of cheap homely ingredients.

Sliced Onionifriedf see No. 299, and note under No. 517, with some 
batter and flour, till they are browned, and nMI>bed through a sieve, 
are excellent to heighten tbe colour and flavour of brown soups and 
sauces, and form the basis of most of tbe Belisbes furnished by Uie 
Restaurateurs— M we guess from the odour which ascends from their 
Kitchens, and salutes our olfactory nerves en passant. 

The older and drier the Onion, the stronger its flavour, and the 
Cook viU regulate the quantity she uses aceordingly.

such, that half a drachm of it^nei^ pounded^ er double the quanti^ 
if not ground or pounded, easting miy one-third of a Farthing wiu 
impregnate half a gallon of soup with almost as much relish as two 
or thi^ beads of the fresh vegetable, weighing seven ounces and 
costing 7\ro-penee. This valuable acquisition to the Soup-pot de« 
serves to be universally known. See also No. 409, Essence of Csi^-

omist — but that our judgment in Falalics may not be called in ques- 
tion by our fellow mortals, who as the Craniologists say, happen to 
have the Organ of Taste stronger than tbe Organ of AccumulaJtive- 
nesSf we must confess, that, with the flavour, it does not impart the 
delicate sweetness, kc. of the fresh Vegetable : and when used, a bit 
of sugar should accompany it. 

II See No. 419 and No. 420, and 469. Fresh green Basil is sel-

98 BROTHS AND SOUPS. 

The general fauU of our En«li&h Soups, seems to he the 
employment of an excess of Spice, and too smaU a prt^ortion 
of Roots and Herbs.* 

Besides the Ingredfeots I have eDumerated, many Culinary 
scribes indiserimiDateiy cram into almost every Dish (in such 
inordinate Quantities, one would suppose they were working 
for the as6estos-palate of an Indian Fire- Eater) Anchovies, 
Garlick,+ Bay leaves, and that hot fiery spice Cayenne% pepper* 
This which the French call (not understood) Piment enrage, 
(404,) has somehow or other, unaccountably acquired a charac- 
ter for being very wholesome, — whilst the milder Peppers and 
Spices are cried down, as destroying the sensibility of the Pa* 
late and Stomach, &c. and being the source of a thousand mis- 
chiefs. We should just as soon recommend Alcohol as be- 
ing less intoxicating than Wine. 

The best thing that has been said in praise of Peppers is, 
*^ that with all kinds of Vegetables, as also with Soups (espe- 
cially vegetable soups) and Fish, either Black or. Cayenne 
Pepper may be taken freely : they are the most useful stimu- 
lants to Old Stomachs, and often supersede the cravings for 
strong^drinks ; or diminish the quantity otherwise required." 
See Carlisle on Old Age, A certain portion of Condiment 
is occasionally serviceable to excite and keep up the languid 
action of feeble and advanced Life; we must increase the 
stimulus of our aliment as the irritability of our system increases. 
We leave those who love these things, to use them as they like ; 
their flavours can be very extemporaneously produced by 
Chilly-juice, or Ctosence of Cayenne (405,) Eshallot wine 
(40^,) and Essence of Anchovy (433.) 



* ** Point de LegumeSi point de Cuisiniere*^ it a favourite culinary adage of the 
French kitchen ; and deserves to be so; a better soup maybe made withaooaple 
of pounds of Meal and plenty of V^;etables, than our common cooks will make yoa 
with four times that quantity of meat} all for want of knowing; the uses of Soup 
roots, and Sweet and Savoury herbfc 

t l^Iany a good dish is spoiled, by the cook not knowing the proper use of this, 
which is to give a flavour, and not to be predominant over the other ingredients : a 
morsel mashed with the point of a knife, and stirred in, is enough. See (No. 4(^0 

X. Foreigners have strange notions of English Taste, on which one of their Culi- 
nary Professors has made the following comment : **^The m^gau of Taste m these 
Jtlanders is very difterent from our Delicate Palatet^tmd sauce that would eaccori* 
ate the palate of a Frenchman, would bebaixily pioi/anfe enough to make any im- 
pression on that of an Englishman ; — thus, they prefer Port to Claret,** &c. As far 
as concerns our Dhnking, we wish there was not quite so much truth in Monsieur** 
i«marks ; but the characteristic of the Fi«nch aiM English kitchen » is Sauce rotth-

BROTHS AND SOUPS. 99. 

There is no French Dinner without Soup, wBich is regard- 
ed as an imiispensable Overture; — ^it is commonly followed 
by '* te Coup d^ApreSy^ a Glass of pure Wine, which they 
consider so wholesome after Soup, that their Proverb says, tlie 
Physician thereby loses a Fee. Whether the glass of Wine 
be so much noiore advantageous for the Patient than it is for his 
Doctor, we know not, but believe it an excellent plan to begin 
the Banquet with a basin of good Soup, which, hy moderat- 
ing the Appetite for solid Animal food, is certainly a salutife- 
rous custom. Between the Rocuta aod the EntremelSt they in- 
troduce ^' le Coup du MUieUf^ or a small glass of Jamaica 
JHum, or Essence of Punchy see (471) ; or Cura^oa (474.) 

It is a custom which almost universally prevails in the 
l^OTtbern parts of Europe, to present a Dram or glass of Li- 
^eur, before sitting down to Dinner : this answers the double 
purpose of a whet to the Appetite, and an announcement that 
Dioner is oo the point of being served up. Along with the 
Dram, is presented on a waiter, little square • pieces of Cheese^ 
slices of cold Tongue, and dried Tongue, and dried Toast, ac- 
companied with fresh Caviar, 

We again caution the Cook to avoid Che r^ Seasonings e^ 
pecially with predominant flavours, which, however agreeable 
they may be to. some, are more e.xtremely disagreeable to 
others, see page 5% 

Zest (255,) Soy (436,) Cavice, Coracb, Anchovy, (433,) 
Curry powder (455,) Savory Ragout Powder (457,) Soup 
-Herb Powder (459) and (460,) Browning (322,) Catsupe 
(432,) Pickle liquor. Beer, Wine, and Sweet Herbs, and Savory 
Spice (460,) are very convenient auxiliaries to finish Soups,&c. 
The proportion of Wine (formerly Sack, then Claret, now 
Madeira or Port) should not exceed a large Wine-glassful to 
a Quart of Soup : — this is as much as can be admitted, with- 
out the vinous flavour becoming remarkably predominant; 
though not only much larger quantities of Wine, (of which 
Claret is incomparably the best, because it contains less spirit 
and more flavour, and English palates are least acquainted with 
it) ; but even veritable Eau de Vie is ordered in many boOks, 
aod used by many (especially Tavern Cooks) — so much, ace 
their Soups overloaded with relish, that if you will eat enough 
of them they will certainly make you Drunk, if they dq,^'t 
make you Sick. All this frequently arises from an old Cook 
Bieasurtng the excitability of the Eaters' palates by his own,-^

ivbicb may also be bluDted by iocesBaDt Tastiog^ tbat to awa&eit 
it, requires Wine instead of water, and Cayenne and Garlicky 
for Black Pepper and Onion^ 

CMd Cooks are, as fond of Spice, as Children are of Si^^^ 
and season SOUP, which is intended to constitute a priocjpal. 
part of a Meal, as highly as SAUCE, of which only a spoonful 
may be Relish enough for a ptate of insipid Viands. See Oha. 
to (355.)-*- However we fancy these, large quantities of Wine, 
&c, are oftener ordered in Cookery Books than used in the 
Kitchen ; — practical Cooks have the Health of their eaiploy- 
ers too much at heart, — and love " Sauce a la Langw?^ too 
well, to overwine their Soup, &e. 

Truffles and Morels^ are also set down as a part of most 
rueoi|U3. These, in their Green state, have a very rich, Uigfa 
flavour, and are delicious additions to some dinners, or spot up 
as a stew by themselves, when they are fresh and fine : but ia 
this state they are not served up half a dozen times tn a.yeat, 
at the first tables in the kingdom : when dried, they become 
mere ** chips in pottage^'* and serve only to soak uf» good^ 
Gravy, — from which, they take more Tftste than they give* 

The Art of competing a rich Soup, is so. to proportion the 
several ingredients one to another, that no particular taste be 
stronger than the rest ; but to produce suck a fine harmonious 
relish, that the whole is delightful; — this requires that judi* 
cious combination of the materials which constitutes the "^ chef' 
d^auvre*^ of Culinary Science. • 

In the first place, take care that the Roots and Herbs be 
perfectly well cleaned ; proportion the Water to the quantity 
of Meai,-aiMl other ingredients,— generally a pound of meat to 
a quart of water, for Soups ; and double tliat quantity for Gra> 
vies. If they Stew gently, litde more water need be put in at 
first, than is expected at the end ; — for when the Pot is cover* 
ed quite close and the fire gentle, very little is wasted. 

Gentle Stewing is incomparably the best, — the Meat is 
more tender and the Soup better flavoured. 

It is of the first importance, that the Cover of a Soup Ket- 
He should fit very close, or the broth will evaporate before 
you are aware of it. The most essential parts are soon evapo- 
rated by Quick Boiling, without any benefit, except to fatten

tb« fortanate Coo)e mho inhftles tbeio. An evident proof tiMt 
these Exhalations* possess the most restorative qualitie«^ lit 
that THE Cook — who te io general the least Eater— -is, as 
generally, the Fattest person in the Family, from cootiooally 
being sorrounded by the Qaintesseoce of all the food she dres- 
ses; irhereof, she sends to her Master only the fibres and 
calcinations, who is consequently TAtn, Gouty, and the Vis- 
tim of Diseases arising from insufficient nourtsbment* 

It is not only the^6re8 of the meat which nourishes ns-^bit 
the Juices they cootain — and these are not only extracted but 
exhaled, if it be boiled fast in an open vessel. A succulent 
soup can never be made but in s well closed vessel, which prs- 
serves the nutritive parts by preventing their dissipation. This 
is a^act of which every intelligent person will soon perceive 
the importance. 

Place i;our Soup^pot over a moderate fire^ which wiU make 
the vxUer ^, uxithout causing it to hoil'-^for at least half an 
- Hnur ; if the water boils immediately, it will not penetrate the 
meat, and cleanse it from the clotted blood, and other matters 
which ought to go off in scum ; the meat will be hardened all 
over by violent Heat, will shrink up as if it was scorched, and 
^\v^ hardly any Gravy ; on the contrary, by keeping the Wa- 
ter a certain time heating without boiling, the Meat swells, be- 
comes tender, its fibres are dilated, and it yields a quantity of 
^um^ which must be taken off as soon as it appears. 

It is not till after a good Half Hour's hot infusion, that we 
may mend the Fire^ and make the^ Pot boil ; stiil continue to 
remote tAe Scum, aod when no more appears, put in the Vege- 
tables, &c. and a tittle salt. These will cause more Scum to 
rise, which must be taken off immediately ; then cover the pot 
very closely, and place it a proper distance from the fire, 
where it will boil very gently and equally, and by no means fast. 

By quick and strong Boilings the volatile and finest parts of 
the ingredients are evaporated and fiy off with the steam, and

the coarser parts are rendered soluble ; — so you lose the good, 
aod get the bad. • 

Soups will generally take from Tkree to Six hours. 

Prepare your Broths and Soups the Evening before y&w 
toant ikem. This will gi^e you more time to attend to the rest 
of your Dinner the next day ; and when the Soup is cold, the 
Fat may be much more easily and completely removed from 
the surface of it : — when you decant it, take care not to disturb 
the settlings at the bottom of the vessel, which are so fine, that 
they will escape through a Sieve, or even through a tammis, 
which is the best strainer, — the Soups appear smoother aod 
finer— and it is much easier cleaned than any sieve. If you 
strain il while it is Hot, pass it through a clean Tammis or 
Napkin . previously soaked in cold water ; the coldness of this 
will coagulate the Fat and only suffer the pure broth to pass 
through. 

The full Havour of the Ingredients can only be extracted by 
very long and slow simmering ;-— during which, take care to 
prevent Evaporation by covering the Pot as dose as possible ; 
the best Stew pot is a Uig ester. 

Clear ■ Soups must be perfectly transparent, — Thickened 
Soups, about the consistence of rich Cream, — and remember 
•that Thickened Soups require nearly double the quantity of 
Seasoning, The Piquance of Spice, (&c. is as much blunted 
by the Flour and Butter, as the Spirit of Rum is by the addi- 
tion of Sugar and Acid ; so they are less salubrious, without 
being more savoury — from the additional quantity of Spice, 
^c. that is smu<j:gled into the stomach. 

To THICKEN AND GIVE BoDY TO SoUPS AND SaUCES, the 

following materials are used — they must be gradually mixed 
with the Soup, till thoroughly incorporated with it ; and it 
should have, at least, half an hour's gentle simmering after : 
if it is all lumpy, pass it thro^h a Tammis or a fine Sieve. 
Bread raspings, Bread, Isinglass, Potato mucilage, (448) fat 
skimroiogs and Flour (248) — or Flour and Butter, or Flour ;

Meat from whkh Broth has been made, (185*) and (^52,) 
and all its juice has been extracted, is then excellently well pre- 
pared for POTTIKG, see (503,) and is quite as good, or better 
than that which has been baked till it is dry* | indeed if it be 
pounded, and seasoned in the usual manner, it will be an ele- 
gant and savoury Luncheon or Supper, — ^and costs nothing but 
the trouble of preparing it, which is very little, and a Relish is 
procured, for Samlvnche9, Sfc. (504,)— of what heretofore has 
been, by the poorest Housekeeper, considered the perqmsUe of 
the Cat. 

Keep some spare Broth, lest your Soup liquor waste in boil- 
ing and get too thick, and for Gravy for your Made Dishes, 
various Sauces, &c. for many of which it is a much belter ba- 
sis* than Melted Butter. 

The Soup op Mock Turtle^ and the other thickened 
Soups (347,) will supply you wiih a thick Gravy Sauce for 
PauUry, Fish, Ragouts, Sfc ; and by a little management of 
this sort, you may generally contrive to have plenty of Good 
Gravies and Good Sauces with very little trouble or expense. 
See also Portable Soup, (252.) 

If Soup is too thin or Coo weak, take off the cover of your 
soup-pot, and let it boil till some of the watery part of it lias 
evaporated, or else, add some of the Thickening materials we 
have before mentioned ; and have at hand some plain Bnowir- 
ing: see (322,) and the 06s. thereon. This simple prepara- 
tion is much better than any of the compounds bearing that 
name, as it colours Sauce or Soup, without much interfermg 
with its flavour, and is a much better way of Colouring them 
than burning the surface of the Meat. 

When Soups and Gravies are kept from day to day, in Hot 
weather, they should be warmed up every day, and put into 
fresh scalded tureens, or pans, and placed in a cool cellar;— in 
Temperate weather, every other day may be enough.

We hope we have no/v pot ibe common Cook into posees- 
aioD of the whole orcomi of Soopmakiog, without orach trouble 
to herself, or expense to her employers ; and that it will not be 
said in future, that ao Englisfamao only Iroows bow to make 
Soup in his Stomach, by swilling down a large quantity of 
Ale, or Porter, to quench the thirst occasioned by the Meat be 
eats : John Bull may now make his Soup '* aecmukm mriem^* 
and save his principal viscera a great deal of trouble. 

*^* In the foUovd/ing Receipts we have directed the SpiceB* 
and Flavouring to be added at the usual time ; hut U wmdd 
greatly diminish the expense^ and imprwe the Seups, if the 
Agents employed to give them a Zest, were Twt put in above fif- 
teen minutes before the finish^ — and half the quantity ofspice, 
Sfc, would do. Ji strong Heat soon dissipates the spirit of the 
Wine, and evaporates the aroma and flavour of the Spices and' 
Herbs, which are vokUiU in tJic heat of Boiling water. 

In ordering the proportions of mbat, bvtter, wine, &c. 
lie proper quantity is set down, and less vnll not do ; we have 
carried Economy quite as far as possible without ** spoiling the 
Broth for a halfpenny^worih of Salt,^^ 

I conclude these remarks, with observing, that some persons ' 
imagine that Soup tends to relax the Stomach — so far from 
heing prejudicial, we consider the moderate use of such liquid 
oourisbment, to be highly salutary. Does notour food and 
drink, even though cold, become in a few minutes a kind of 
Warm Soup in the stomach ; and, therefore. Soup, if not eaten 
too hot, or in too great a quantity, and of proper quality, is at- 
tended with great advanUges, especially to those who drink 
but little. 

Warm Fluids in the form of Soup, nnite with obt juices 
aiuch sooner, and better, than those that are cold and raw — on 
this account. Restorative Soup is the best Food for those 
who are enfeebled by Disease or Dissipation, or for old peo- 
ple, whose Teeth and Digestive organs are impaired.

It is of as much importance that the Cook should know how 
to make a boat of good Gravy for her Poultry, 8tc, as, that it 
should be sent up of proper complexion, and nicely frothed. 

In this Chapter we shall endeavour to introduce to her all 
the Materials* which give flavour in Sauce^ which is the £9- 
aence of Soup^ and intended to contain more relish in a Tea- 
spoonful^ than the former does in a Tahlespoonfid, And we 
hope to deserve as much praise from the Economist ^ as we do 
from the Bon Vivant ; as we have taken great pains to intro- 
duce to him the methods of making Substitutes for those ingre- 
dients, which are always expensive, and often not to be had at 
a}]. Of these, those who have large families, and limited in- 
comes, will no doubt be glad to avail themselves. 

The reader may rest assured, — that whether he consults this 
Book to diminish the expense, or increase the pleasures of Hos- 
pitality, — he will find all the information that was to be ob- 
tained up to 1822, communicated in the most unreserved and 
intelligible manner. 

A great deal of the Elegance of Cookery — depends upon 
the Accompaniments to each dish being appropriate and well 
adapted to it. 

We can assure our readers, no attention has been wanting on 
our part to render this department of the work worthy their pe-

rusal : — each Receipt, is the faithful navratiYe of actnal and re- 
peated expenroents, — ^and has received the moat deliberate con- 
sideration before it was here presented to tbem. — It is given in 
the most circomstaDtial manner, and not in the technical, and 
mysterious language former writers on these subjects seam to 
have preferred : — by which their directions are useless and un- 
intelligible to all who have not regularly served an apprentice- 
ship at the Stove. 

Thus, instead of minutely enumerating the Quantities and 
explaining the process of each composition, they order a ladleful 
of Stocky — a, pint of Consomme^ — and a spoonful of CullU; as 
if a Private Family Cook had always at hand a soup-kettle full 
of Stockj a store of ConsommSj and the larder of Albion House 
— and as if Spoons and Pennyioorths were the same in all ages. 

It will be to very little purpose I have taken so much pains 
to teach how to manage Roasts and Boils, — -if a Cook cannot 
or will not make the several Sauces that are usually sent up 
with tbem. 

The most homely fare may be made relishing, and the most 
excellent and independent, improved by a well made Sauce,* 
— as the most perfect Picture may by being well varnished. 

We have, tbereforerendeavoured to give the plainest direc* 
tions, how to produce with the least trouble and expensef pos- 
sible all the various compositions the £oglish kitchen afift>rds,and

eiently savoury, it cannot produce this effect, and if too ptqutmte^ it will nanilyze, 
insteaid of exciting, those deiieious titillations of tongue, and Tibrations of Palate, 
tbat only the most accomplished Philosophers of the Mouth can produce on the high- 
ly educated palates of thnee happy Orandt Goumutndt,** 

t To save Time and Trouble is the most valuable frugality ; and If the mistress of 
a fiimity will condescend to devote a little time to the profitable and pleasant em- 
ployment of prepal-ing some of the Store Sauces^ especially Not. 323, 408, 404, 413, 
429,433,439,454; these, both Epicures and Economists^ will avail themselves of the 
advantage now given them, of preparing at home. 

By the help of these, many Didies may be dressed in half the asnal Time,— and 
with half die Trouble and Expense,— and fiaToured and finished with much more 
eertainty than by the common methods. 

A small portion of the Tim« whidi young Ladies sacrifice to torturing the strings 
of their PianthFortef employed in obtaining Domestic Accomplisbments— mirhtuot 
make them worse wives, or less agreeable Companions to their Husbands. This was 
the opinion 200 years ago. 

** To speak then of the Knowledge which betongi unto our British Housewife— I 
hofai the most principal, to be a perfect skill in Cookery ; Shee that is utterly igno- 
rant therein, may not by the Lawes of strict Justice, challenge Uie fueedom of Mar-

Wife, is the must certain Charm to ensure the Affec^n and Industry of a Husband.

suit all tastes and all pockets ; so that a cook tnay give satis- 
faction in all families ; the more combinations of this sort sfae 
is acquainted with, the better she will comprehend tfaemana^ 
inent of every one of them. 

We have rejected some OuUandhk Farraguea^^hom a con-^ 
viction they were by no means adapted to an -Eoglfsh palate ; 
if they have been received into some English books, for the 
sake of swelling the volumes, we believe they never will be re- 
ceived by an English stomach unless for the rsason tbey were 
admitted into the Cookery book ; i. e. because ke has nothing 
else to put into it. 

However, " les pompeuses Bagatdle$ de Ut Cuisine Ma9^

the substance, to pursue the shadow, pnKer wonderful and 
whimsical metainorphoses, and things extravagantly expensive

Mutton can hardly hope for a welcome, unless accompanied

Spider ; — or Pork, without being either *' Qoosijixd^ or 
•* Lamhifiedy'* see (No. 51,) and Oaiics and Poultry in the 
shape of Crawfish or Hedgehogs, 

These travesties rather show the patilence than the science of 
the Cook, and the bad taste of those who prefer such Baby- 
tricks^ to eld English nourishing and substantial plain Cookery.

Game Gravy, (No. 3^9,) will be infinitely more acceptable to 
the unsophisticated appetite of Englishmen, for whose proper 
and rational recreation we sat down to compose these Receipts : 
whose approbation we have done our utmost to deserve, by de- 
voting mach time to the business of the Kitchen : and by re- 
peating the various processes we thought admitted of the smal- 
lest improvement. 

We sbaJl be fully gratified if our Book is not bought up with 
quite so much avidity by those high bred Epicures, who are 
unhappily so much more nice than wise, — that they cannot eat 
any thing dressed by an English Cook, — and vote it barba- 
rously unrefined, and intolerably ungenteel, to endure the sight 
of the best bill of fare that can be contrived, if written in the 
Vulgar tongue of Old England.* 

Let your Sauces each display a decided character ; send up 
your PLAIN Saucbs {Oyiter^ Lobster ^S^c) as pure as possible;

their name.

sauce sufficiently savoury, without putting into it, every thing

their plain aAVcse, by overloading them with salt and spioee,

On the eontrary, of Gompourd Savce8<— the ingredieots 
should be so nicely proportioned, that no one be predominant ; 
— *so that from the equal.union of the combined flavours, such 
a fine mellow mixture is prodiioed, whose very novelty cannot 
fail of being aoeeptable to the persevering: Gcurmand^ if it has 
not pretensions to a permanent place at his ta^le. 
: An ingenious Coe/c will form as endless a variety of these 
compositions as a Musix^n with his seven* notes, — or a 
Pointer with his colours : no part of her business offers so fair 
and frequent an opportunity to display her abilities. Spices, 
Herbs, &c. are often very absurdly and injudiciously iumbled 
tegether. \ 

Why have Clove and Allspice, or Mace and Natmeg^n the 
same 8auce,--^r Majorum, Thyme, and Savory ; or Onions, 
Leeks, Eshallots, and Oarlick ? — one will very well supply the 
place of the other, and the frugal Cook may save something 
considerable by attending to (his, to the advantage of her em- 
ployer, and her own time and trouble. You might as well, to 
make Soup, order one Quart of water from the Thumts^ anoth- 
er from the JWtt? River, a third from Hampstead, and a fourth 
from CheUea, with a certain portion of Spring and Rain Water, 

In many of our Receipts, we have fallen in with the fashion 
of ordering a mixture of Spices, &c. which the above hint 
will enable the culinary student to correct. 

** Pharmacy is now much more simple,*^CooKERT may be

The RagouU of the last Centurif tmd infinitely more incredt- 
ents than we use now — the praise given to WUL Rabisha for 
his Cookery, 12mo. 1673, is 

** To frjr and fKcasee,hn vAj't most neat. 
For he compounds a thomand loru of meat.** 

To become a perfect Mistress of the art of cleverly extract- 
ing and combining flavours* besides the gift of a good Taste, 
requires all the experience and skill of the most accomplished 
Professor^ and especially, an intimate acquaintance with tba 
Palate she is working for; 

Send your Sauces to Table as hoi as possible. 

Nothing need be more unsightly than the Surface oC a Sauc* 
in a frozen state, or garnished with grease on the top ; the 
Vtest way to get rid of thk, is to pats it through a Tammis or 
T^apkin previously soaked in cold water, the cotdness of the 
napkin will coagulate the Fat, and only suffer the pare Ghravy 
to pass tbrocgb ; — if any particiUs of Fai remain^ take ikem 
<iff by applying JUUfing papery as blotting paper is applied to 
Ink. 

Let your Sauces boil up after you put in Wine, Anchovy, 
or Thickening, that their flavours may be well blended with tha 
other ingredients^ ; and keep in mind that the ^^chef-^mwore^* 
of Cookery, is to entertain the Mouth without offending the 
Stomach. 

N. B. Although I have endeavoured to give the particular 
quantity of each ingredient used in the following Sauces, as 
they are generally made, still the^Cook's judgment n^ust direct 
her to lessen or increase either of the ingredients, according to 
the taste of those she works for, and will always be on the alert 
to ascertain what are the favourite Accompaniments desired 
with each dish. See Jdvice to Cooks, page 59.

it closely with a new cork that will fit it very tight. Use only 
the best superfine Velvet taper corks. 

EcoDomy ia Corks is rery unwise ; in order to save a mere 
trifle, in th& price of the cork, you run the risk of losing the 
valuable article it is intended to preserve. It is a Vulgar Er- 
ror that a bottle roust be well stopped, when the cork is forced^ 
down even with the mouth of it, — this is a sure sign that the 
Cork is too small, and it should be re-drawn and a larger one 
put in. 

TO MAKE BOTTLE CEMENT. 

Haifa pound black rosin, same quantity of red sealing wax, 
quarter ounce bees wax, melted in an earthen or iron, pot ; 
when it froths up, before all is melted and likely to boil over, 
stir it with a Callow candle, which will settle the froth till all is 
melted and fit for ase. 

N. B. This cement is of very great use in preserving things 
that you wish to keep a longtime, which without its help would 
soon spoil, from the clumsy and ineffectual manner the Bottles 
are corked.

its nutritive juices,— and if it can be smuggled into the stom-

into practice, that they will find that the most nutritious and 
elegant disbe^, are neither the most difficult to dress, — the 
most expensive, — nor the most indigestible ;*~in those compo-

Cot off the Shaak fiione, and trim the Knuckle, put it ioto 
lukewarm water for ten minutes, wash it clean, coTer it with 
eold water, and let it simmer very genUy^ and skim it carefully. 
A Leg of nine pounds will take two and a half or three hours, 
if you like it thoroughly dooe, especially in very cold weather. 

For the Accompaniments see the following Receipt. 

N. B. The Tit BiU with an Epicure, are the Krmckley the

and a Bounder, furnish the little Masters and Mistresses of Keot, 
with the most favourite set of play things. 

A Leg of Mutton, stewed very slowly^ as we have directed 
the Beef to be, (No. 493,) will be as agreeable to an English 
palate as the famous, ** Gigot* de Kpt neures*' of the French 
Kitchen. 

When Mutton is Yery large, you may divide it, and 
rooit the FiUety i. e. the large end, — and boil the Knuckle end, 
— and you may also cut some fine Cutlets ofT the thick end of 
the Leg, — and so have Tico or Three good Hot Dinners, 

The Liquor the Mutton is boiled in you may convert into' 
Good Souptn Five Minutea, see N. B. [No. ^18,] and Scotch 
Barley Broth, [No. ^04.] Thus managed, a Leg of Mutton is ft 
most Economical Joint.

Neck ofMuUon. (No, 2.) 

Put four or five pounds of the best end of a Neck, (tbat has 
been kept for a few days) into as much cold sofi water as will 
corer it, and about two inches over, let it simmer very sloidy 
for two hours ; — it will look most delicate if you do not take 
off the Skin till it has been boiled. 

For Sauce, that elegant and innocent relish, Parsley and 
Butter (No. 361,) or Eshallot (No. 394 or 5,) or Caper sauce 
(No. 374,) Mock Caper sauce (No. 375,) and Onion Sauce 
(No. 298,) Turnips (No. 130,) or Spinage (No. 131,) are 
the usual accompaniments to Boiled Mutton, 

Lamb. (No. 3.) 

A Leg of five pounds should simmer very gently for aboat 
Two Hours, from the time it is put on, in cold water. — After 
the general rules for Boiling,^ in the first chapter of the Rudi- 
ments OP Cookery, we have nothing to add, only to send up 
with it Spinage (No. 123,) Brocolt (No. 136,) Caulifiower 
(No. 125) &c. and for Sauce (No. 261.) 

Veal. (No. 4.) 

This is expected to come to table looking very delicately 
clean, — it is so easily discoloured, you must be careful to have 
clean water, — a clean vessel, — ^and constantly catch the scum 
as soon and as long as it rises, and attend to the directions be* 
fore given in the first Chapter of the Rudiments of Cook* 
BRT. Send up Bacon (No. 13,) Fried Sausages (No. 87,) or 
pickled Pork, Greens (No. 118, and following Nos.) and Pars* 
ley, and Butter (No. 261,) Onion Sauce (No. 298.) 

N. B. For Receipts to Cook Veal, see from (No. 512) 
to (No. 621.) 

BeefBouilli, . (No. 5.) 

In plain English, is understood to mean Boiled Beef; but 
its culinary acceptation, in the French Kitchen, is fresh beef 
dressed without boiling, and only very gently simmered by a 
slow fire. 

English Cooks have seldom any notion, that good Soop 
tan be made without destroying a great deal of Meat :* —

however, by a judicious regulation of the Tire, and a vigilant 
attendance on the Soup kettle, this may be accoroplished — and 
you shall have a tureen of such Soup as will satisfy the most 
fastidious Palate, — and the Meat make its appearance at table, 
at the same time, in possession of a full portion of nutritious 
succulence. 

This requires nothing more, than to Stew the meat ver^ 
slowly, (instead of keeping the pot boiling a g(dlop, as common 
Cooks too commonly do,) and to take it up as soon as it is done 
enough. (See No. 238, No. 493, and 204.) 

Meat cooked in this manner, affords much more nourish* 
ment than it does dressed in the common way, — is easy of di- 
gestion in proportion as it is tender, — and an invigorating sub- 
stantial diet, especially valuable to the Foor, whose laborious 
emp\oy men ts require support.

would often go to the Butcher's shop, when they now run to

ed by the Cook forgetting to take out the kernels ; one in the 
udder of a round of Beef, — in the fat in the middle of the 
Round,-^tbose about the thick end of the Flank, &c. if these 
are not taken out, all the Salt in the world will not keep the 
the Meat. 

The Aet of Salting Meat, is to rub in the Salt thor- 
oughly and evenly into every part, and to fill all the holes full of 
Salt where the kernels were taken out,— and where the Butch- 
er^s skewers were. 

A Round of Beef of 25 pounds will take a pound and a 
half of Salt to be rubbed in all at first, and requires to be turn* 
ed and rubbed every day with the Brine : it will be ready for 
dressing in four or five days,* if you do not wish it very salt* 

In Summer^ the sooner Meat is salted after it is killed the 
better, and care must be taken to defend it from the fiies. 

In Winter^ it will eat the shorter and tenderer, if kept a few 
days (according to the temperature of the weather) before it is 
salted. 

In Frosty Weather^ take care the Meat is not frozen, and 
warm the Salt in a Frying-pan. The extremes of Heatf and 
Cold are equally unfavourable for the process of Salting — in 
the former the meat changes before the salt can a£fect it, — in 
the latter it is so hardened and the juices are so congealed, that 
the salt cannot penetrate it. 

If you vmh it Red, rub it first with SaUpetrCy in the propor- 
tion of half dn ounce and the like quantity of moist sugar to a 
pound of common Salt, ( See Savoury Sidt Beef, No. 49Q,) 

Yon may impregnate Meat with a very agreeable Vegeta- 
ble Flavour, by pounding some Sweet Herbs (No. 459) and an 



* If not to be cut till Cold, two dayi longer wdting will not only improre itt fla- 
vour, littt the Meat will keep better,

To FickU Meat, 

*^ Six pounds of Salt, one pound of Sugar, and four ounces 
of Saltpetre, boiled with four gallons of water skimmed, and 
allowed to cool, forms a very strong pickle, which will pre* 
serve any Meat completely immersed in it. To effect this, 
which is essential, either a heavy board or a flat stone must be 
laid upon the meat. The same pickle may be used repeatedly, 
provided it be boiled up occasionsilly with additional salt to 
restore its strength, diminished by the combination of part of 
the salt with the m^eat, and by the dilution of the pickle by the 
juices of the meat ^tracted. By boiling, the Albumen which 
would cause the pickV to spoil, is coagulated and rises in the 
form of scu^ which must be carefully removed.'' — See Sujp* 
plcment to Encyclop, Britan, 

An H-boneof 10 or 12 pounds weight will require about 
three quarters of a pound of Salt and an ounce of Moist Su- 
gar to be well rubbed into it«- will be ready in four or.£ve 
days, if turned and rubbed every day. 

The Time Meat requires Saltings depends upon the Weight 
of ait, and how much Salt is used. If it be rubbed in with a 
heavy band, it will be ready much sooner than if only lightly 
rubbed. 

N. B. Dry the Salt and rub it with the Sugar in a mortar. 

Pork requires a longer time to cure (in proportion to its 
weight) than Beef: a Leg of Pork, should be in salt eight or 
ten days ; turn it and rub it every day. 

Salt Meat should be well washed before it is boiled, — 
especially if it has been in salt long, — that the liquor ia 
which the meat is boiled, may not be too salt to make Soup of. 
[No. 218,] &c. and [No. 555.] 

If it has been in salt a long time and you think it will be too 
salt, wash it well in cold water, and soak it in lukewarm water 
for a couple of hours : if it is very Salt, lay it in water the 
night before you intend to dress it. 

w3 Round of Salted Beef (No. 7.) 

As this is too large for a moderate family, we shalJ write 
directions for the dressing half a round : get the Tongue side. 

Skewer it up tight and round, and tie a fillet of broad tape 
round it to keep the skewers in their places.

Put it into plenty of cold water, and carefnHy catch tba 
scum as soon as it rises; let it boil till all tbe wtrai isremored^ 
and then pot the boiler on one side of tbe fire, to keep shntner' 
ing slowly till it is clone. 

Half a round of 15 lbs. will take about three bturs— if it 
ifveigbs more, give it more time. 

When you Uke it up, if any stray scum, &c. sticks to it, that 
has escaped the vigilance of your skimmer, wash it off with a 
Paste Brush— garnish tiM dish with Carrote and Turnips :— 
send up Carrots, (No.l29,) Turnips, (No. 130,) and Parsnips, 
or Greens, (No. 118, &c.) on separate dishes. Pease pudding 
(No. 556), and My Pudding, (No. 551,) are aH very proper

H'Bone of Beef— (No. 8.) 

Is to be managed in exactly the same manner as the Round, 
but will be sooner boiled, as it is not so solid : an H-tmne of 
201bs.will be enough in about three hours and a balf, — oflOlbs. 
in two hours. Be sure tbe boiler is big enough to allow it 
plenty of water room : let it be well covered with water, set 
the pot on one side of tbe fire to boil gently ; if it boils quick 
at first, no art can make it tender after ; the slower it hoils, the 
better it vnll look, and the tenderer it will be. The same ac- 
companying vegetables, as in tbe preceding Receipt. Dress 
plenty of Carrots, as cold carrots are generally a favourite with 
cold Beef.

8ed» it is a favourite dish with almost every body ; take care it

Some sagacious Cooks (who remember, to bow many more

06s. — See (Nps» 526 ^nd 527) : when only a HtUe Bacon 
is vxmiedf these are the best ways of dressing it. 

The boiling of Bacon^ is a very simple subject to comment 
upon^ but our main object is to teach common Cooks the art of 
dressing common food, in the best manner : Bacon is some- 
times as salt as salt can make it ; therefore, before it is boiled, 
it must be soaked in warm water for an hour or two, changing 
the water once ; then pare off the rusty and smoked part, trim^ 
it nicely on the underside, and scrape the rind as clean a^ 
possible. 

M EM. Bacon is an extravagant artide in Housekeeping^r^ 
there is often twice as rnuch^ dressed as need be, — when it is 
sent to table as an aecoq^paniment to boiled Pooltry or Veal, a 
pound and a half is a plenty for a dozen people. A good 
German Sausage is a very economical substitiite for Bacon,—

Mbm. The Salt, Seasonings and- Smoke^ which preserve it 
before it is eateii, prevent its solution after— ^nd unless it be 
very long, and very gently stewed, the strongest Stomach will 
have a tough Job to -extract any nourishment from it. If it is 
a very dry fVesiphalian Ham 9 it must be soaked according to 
its age and thickness, from 12 to 24 hours ; for a Green York' 
ahire or fV^Umoreland S^am^ from 4 to 8 hours will be suffi- 
cient. Luke-warm water will soften it much sooner than cold 
—when sufficiently soaked, trim it nicely on the under side, and 
pare off all the rusty and smoaked parts till it- looks delicately 
clean. 

Give it plenty of water room, and put it in while the water

THE 

COOK^S ORACLE. 



ROASTING. 



N.B. r/ the Time we have allowed for Roasting y appears rather 
longer than what is stated in former works, we can only say, we hac6 
written from actual ExperimentSj—and that the difference may be ae- 
couniea for, by emnmon Cooks generally being fond of too fierce a 
Jire, putting things too near to it. Our calculations are made for a 
Temperature ofaffout 60 degrees of Fahrenheit, 

Slow Roastimg- m as advantageous as Slow Binling, of which evertf 
body understands the importance. 

The Warmer the weather, and the staler killed the Meat is—4ht less 
time it will require to roast it.-^ Beef is in proper season ihrou^hoxA 
the whole year^ bull as BulcTiers generally calculate upon its being a 
Saodaj'c Dinner, you can seldom dtpend'upon its being tender on any 
9ther day. 

Sir-Loin of Beef. (No. 19.) 

The Noble Sir-Loin* of about fifteen pounds, (if much 
thicker, the outside will be dene too much before the inside is 
enough,) will require to be before the fire about three and a 
half or four hours :; take care to spit it evenly, that ' it may not

t " In tbe presentfoihion of Fatting Cattle, it ii more desirable 
to roast away the Fat, than to preserve it. If the honourable Socie- 
ties of Agriculturalists at the time they consulted a learned Profes« 
sor about the composition of Manures, had consulted some competent 
authority on the nature of Animal substances, the Public might have 
escaped the over-grown corpulency of the Animal flesh, which every 
where fills the markets." — Domestic Managementy 12mo, 1813. 

'* Game and other witd animals proper for food, are of very supe* 
rior qualities to the tame — from the total contrast of the circumstan- 
ces attending them. They have a free range of exercise in the open 
air, and choose their own food, the good effects of which are very 
evident in a short delicate texture of flesh found only in them. Their 
juices and flavour are more pure, and their Fai, when it is in any 
degree, as in Venison,. and some other instances, diflers as much from 
that of our fatted Animals, as Silver and Gold from the grosser me- 
tals. The superiority of Welch Mutton and Scotch Beep is ow- 
ing to a similar cause.*'— /&t<l. p. 150. 

If there is more Fat than you think will be eaten with the Meat, 
cut it oflT, it will make an excellent Pitddikg, (No. 554 ;) or clarify it, 
*ee (So. 84,) and use it for Frying :— for those who like their meat 
done thoroughly, and use a moderate fire for roasting, the Fat need 
not be covered with paper. 

J/your Beef it large, and your Family small, — cut ofi'the thin end 
and salt it, — and cut out and dress the fillet, (t. e. commonly called 
the inside) next day as Mock Habe, (No. 68* ;) thus you get Thres 

food hot Dinners. See also the Appendix to Chapter 9— on Made

Ribs of Beef honed and roUed. (No. ^1.) 

When you have kept two or three ribs of beef till qnite-tei^ 
der, take out the bonee, and skewer it as rotiod as posni^e, (like 
a fiHet of veal:) before they roll it, some Cooks Egg it, and 
sprinkle it with Veal steffing, (No. 374«) As the meat is more 
in a solid mass, it will require more time at the fire thao ia thi 
precedrag receipt ; a piece of ten or twelve pounds weigbt 
will not be well and thoroughly roasted ia less than four and a 
half or five hours. 

For the first half hour, it shoufd not be lees tbsio 12 iocbas 
from the fire, that it may get gradually warm to the centre: the 
hut half boor before it wiU be finished, sprinkle a little salt over 
it ; and if you wish to froth it, fioar it, &c. 

MUTTON^ (No. 23.) 

As Beef requires a large sound fire. Mutton must have a 
brisk and sharp one : Tf you wish to have Mutten tender, it 

serve the Gravy in t)ie meat, aod the goodly appearance aho — by cut-

iooth, i. e. four years old Mutton, is as good eating as Venison^ 
if it is accompanied by (Nos. 3^9) and (346.) 

The Leg, Haunch, and Saddle will be the better for being 
hong up in a cook airy place for four or fire da^s at least; ki 
Temperate weather, a week ; in Cold weather, ten days. 

Tf you think your Mutton will not be tender enough to do 
honour to (he Spit, dress it as^a *< GigU de sept heures^* see 
N. B. to (No. 1,) and (No, 493.) 

^ ^g^— (No. 24.) 

Of eight pounds will take about two hours : let it be well 
basted and frothed in the same manner as directed in (No. 19.) 
To Hash Mutton, (No. 484.) To Broil it, (No. 487,) &e. 

A Chine or SaddUs,-— (No. 26.) 

(i. e. the two Loins,) of ten or eleven pounds — two hours 
and a half : it is the business of the Butcher to take off the 
akin and skewer it on again — to defend the meat from extreme 
beat, and preserve its succulence — if this is neglected tie a sheet 
of paper over it : (baste the strings you tie it on with directly, 
or they will burn :) about a quarter of an hour before you 
think it will be done, take off the skin or paper, that it may gat 
a pale brown colour — and then baste it and flour it lightly to 
froth it. We like (No. 346) for sauce. 

N. B. Desnre the Butcher to cut off the flaps and the tail 
and chump end, and trim away every part — that has not indis- 
putahle pretensions to be eaten. This will reduce a Saddle of 
41b. weight to about six or seven lb.

IH ROASTING, 

A Shoulder, (No. 27.> 

Of seven pounds, an hour and a half; put the spit in close 
to the shank bone, and run it along the blade bone. 

N. B. The BLADE BONB is a favourite Luncheon or Supper 
relish, scored^ peppered and salted, and boiled, or done in a 
Dutch Oven. 

A Lom,+ (No. 28.) 

Of Mutton, from an hour and a half, to an hour and three 

quarters. The most elegant way of carving thisy is to cut it 

lengthwise, as you do a Saddle, reind (No. 26.) 

N. B. Spit it on a skewer or lark spit, and tie that on the 

common spit, and do not spoil the meat by running the spit 

through the prime part of it 

A Neck, (No. 29.) 

About the same time as a Loin. It must be carefully joint- 
ed, or it is difficult to carve. The Neck and Breast are in small 
families commonly roasted together — the Cook will then crack 
the bones across the middle before they are put down to roast 
-—if this is not done carefully, they are very troublesome to 
carve, 

Obs, — If there is more Fat than you think will be eaten with 
the lean, cut it ofl^ and it will make an excellent Suet Pudding, 
(No. 551,) or (No. 554.) 

N. 3. The best way to Spit this, is to run iron skewers across 
it--r|ind put the spit between them.

Sauce, (No. 346.) It generally weighs about 15 poundsj and 
requires about three hours and a half to roast it. 

Mutton^ Femson fashion, (No. 32«) 

Take a neck cf good four or five year old south-doiva 
wether Mutton cut long in the bones : let it hang (in tem- 
perate weather) at least a week : two days before you dress it, 
take aHspice and black pepper grouod and peuoded fine, a 
quarter of an ounce each, rub them together, and then rub 
your mutton well with this mixture twice a day : — when you 
dress it, wash off the spice with warm water, and roast it in ' 
paste, as we haTe ordered the haunch of Tenisoo : — (No. 63.^ 

Obs, — Persevering and ingenious Epicures, have ioTented 
many methods to give Mutton the flavour of Venison — some 
say that Mutton prepared as above, may be mistaken for Veni' 
B9n — others that it is full as good ; the refined palate of a Grand 
Crourmand (in spite of the Spice and Wine the meat has been 
fuddled and robbed with) will perhaps still protest against 
^ Welch Venison^ — and indeed we do not understand by what 
conjuration Allspice and Claret can communicate the flavour of 
VsHisoN to Mtt</on— we confess our fears that the flavour of 
Venison (especially of its Fat) is inimitable — but believe you 
can procure Prime eight^tooth Wether Mutton, keep it the 
proper time, and send it to table with the accompaniments (No. 
346) and (347,) &c. usually given to Venison. A rational 
Epicure will eat it with as much satisfaction, as be would 
« feed on the King's Fallow Deer." 

VEAL. (No. 33.) 

Veal requires particular care to roast it a nice Brown. Let 

the fire be the same as for Beef ; a sound large fire for a large 

joint, and a brisker for a smaller : put it at some distance from 

the fire to soak thoroughly, and then draw it near to finish it 

brown. 

When first laid down, it is to be basted ; baste it occasionally. 
When the Veal is on the dish pour over it half a pint x>f melted 
Butter, (No. 256) ; if you have a little brown Qravy by you, 
add that to the Butter, see (No. 326.> With those joints which 
are not Stuffed^ send up Forcemeat^ (No. 374,) or (No. 375i)

A Loin^"^ (No. 35.) 

Is the best part of the Calf, and will take about three hoars

send it up on a Toast, which is eaten with the Kidney and the 
fat of this pai^, which is more delieate than any marrow, $ c.

LAMB,— (No. 40.) 

Is a delicate, and commonly considered Tender meat — 
but those who talk of teruier X«am&— while they are thinking 
of the Age of the Animal, forget, that even a Chicken must be 
kept a proper time after it has been killed, or it will be tough

The Leg and the Loin of Lamb should always be roasted to-

bread crumbs mixed with Sage and Onion minced very fine, 
or ZEST (No. 255) sprinkled over it. 

N. B. ^ The western Pigs from Berks, Oxford, and Bucks, possess 
a decided superiority over the eastern, of Essex, Sussex, and Norfolk ; 
not to forget tinother qualification of the former, at which some read- 
ers may smile, — a thickness of the skin, whence the Crackling of the 
roasted Pork, is a fine gelatinous substance, which may be easily 
masticated, whilst the crackling of the thin skinned breeds is roasted 
into good block Tin, the reduction of which would almost require 
Teeth of Iron." — Mqwmkay en PouUty, 1816, p. 242 There is a 
second Edition of this book which seems to be the b^st work on the 
subject we have seen. 

A Leg,— (No. 50.) 

Of eight poonds, will require ahoot three hours : score the 
skin across in narrow stripes (some score it in diamonds) about 
a quarter of an inch apart :— ^tuff the knuckle with sage aad 
onion minced fine, and a little grated bread seasoned with pep- 
per, salt, and the yolk of an Egg; see DucsSTUFFiNa (No. 

61.) 

Rub a little sweet Oil on the skin with a paste brush, or a 
goose feather : this makes the Cracklihg crisper and browner, 
than basting it with dripping: and it will be a better colour 
than all the art of Cookery can make it any other way. And 
this is the best way of preventing the skin from blistering-^ 
which, is principally occasioned by its being put too near the 
fire.

which varies very much : — lay the thick end nearest to the 
Fire. 

A proper «ald Spare-Rlb of eight pounds weight, (so call- 
ed because almost all the Meat is pared off,) with ck steady fire* 
will be done in an hour and a quarter : — there is so little meat 
on a bald Spare-Rib, that if you have a large fierce fire, it will 
be burnt before it is warm through ; joint it nicely, and crack 
the Ribs across as you do Ribs o^Lamb. 

When you put it dowo to roast, dust on some flourt ^o^ 
baste it with a little butter ; dry a dozen Sage leaves, and rub 
through a hair sieve, and ptit them into the top of a pepper 
box, and about a quarter of an hour before the meat is dpoe,

hours. 

N. B. Chines are generally salted and boiled. 

A Swking P%,f (No. 56.) 

Is in prime order for the spit, when about three weeks old. 

It loses part of its goodness every hour after it is killed ; — if 
act quite fresh, no art can make the Crackling crisp. 

To be in perfection, it should be kilied in the morning to be 
eaten at dinner ;•— it requires very careful roasting. — A sucking 
Pig, like a young Child, must not be left for an instant. 

The ends, must have more fire than the middle ;-^for this 
purpose is contrived an Iron to bang before the middle part, 
called a Pig iron. If yo'u have not this, use a common fiat 
Iron, or keep the fire fiercest at the two ends. 

For the Stuffing, take of the crumb of a stale loaf about 
five ounces ; rub it through a eullender ; mince fine a handful

oance aod a half* ;) mix these together with an egg, some pep^ 
per aod salt, aod a bit of butter as big as ao egi^ ; fill the belly 
of the pig with this, aod sew it up ; lay it to the fire, aod baste 
it with Salad Oil till it is quite done ; — do not leave it a mo- 
ment ; it requires the most vigilant attendance. 

Roast it at a clear brisk fire, at some distance. To gain the 
praise of Epicurean Pig-Eaters, the Crackling must be nice' 
iy crisped and delicately lightly browned^ without being either 
blistered or burnt. 

A small three-weeks old Pig will be eooughf in about an 
hour and a half. 

Before you take it from the Fire, cut off the head, and part 
that and the body down the middle ; chop the Brains very 
fine with some boiled Sage leaves, and mix them with good 
Veal Gravy, made as directed in (No. 193,) or Beef Gravy,. 
(No. 329,) or what runs from the Pig, when you cut its head 
off. Send up a tureenful of Gravy, (No. 329,) besides. — Cur- 
rant Sauce is still a favourite with 9ome of the Old School. 

Lay your Pig back to back in the dish, with one half of the 
head on each side, and tbe Ears, one at each endj which yeu' 
must take care to make nic^ and crisps or you will get scolded 
as the good man was, who bought his wife a pig with only one 
ear. 

When you cut off the Pettitoes, leave the skin long round 
the ends of the legs. When you first lay the Pig before tbe 
fire, rub it all over with Fresh Butter or Salad Oil, ten minutes 
after, and the skin cooks dry — dredge it well with flour all over 
— let it remain on an hour — then rub it off with a soft cleth. 

N. B. A Pig is a very troublesome subject to Roast — most 
persons have them Baked; send a quarter of a pound of butter, 
and beg the baker to baste it well. 



* Some delicately sensitive Patetet desire the Cook to parboil the Sage and Onions, 
(before they are eutj to soften and take off the rawneu «tf theiisflavouri the older 
and drier the Onion, the stronger will be its flavoar, and the learned Evylyn orders 
these to be edulcorated, by gentle maceration.

Turkey, Turret Powlts, and other Poultry. (No, 57J) 

A Fowl, and a Turret, require the same management at 
ihn fire, only the latter will take longer time. 

Many a Christmas dinner has been spoiled, by the Turkey 
having been bung up in a cold larder, becoming tboronghly 
frozen ; Jack Fnnt has ruined the reputation of many a Tur- 
key Roaster : therefore, in very Cold fVeaiherj remember the 
Note in the 4th page of the 2d chapter of the Ruoimrhts of 

CoOKERT. 

Let them be carefully picked, &a and break the breastbone 
(to make them look plump,) twist up a sheet of clean writing 
paper, light it, and thoroughly singe the Turkey all orer, tam- 
ing it about over the flame. 

Turrets, Fowls, and Cafovs, have a much better appear- 
ance, if, instead of trussing them with the legs close togethec, 
and the feet cut oif, the Legs are extended on each side of the 
bird, and the toes only cut off, with a skewer through each 
foot, to keep them at a proper distance. 

Be careful, when you draw it, to preserve the Liver, and not 
to break the Gall-bag^ as no washing will take off the bitter 
taste it gives, where it once touches. 

Prepare a nice clear brisk fire for it. 

Make Stuffing according to (Nos. 374, or 376,) — stuff it 
under the breast, where the craw was taken out, and make some 
into Balls — and boil or fry them, and lay them round the dish ; 
they are handy to help, and you can then reserve some of the 
inside stuffing^to eat with the cold Turkey--H>r to enrich a 
Hash, (No. 533.) 

Score the Gizzard — dip it into the Yolk of an Egg or melt- 
ed butter, and sprinkle it with salt and a few grains of Cayenne 
' — put it under one Pinion, and the Liver under the other, 
cover the Liver with buttered Paper, to prevent it from getting 
hardened or burnt. 

When you first put a Turkey down to roast, dredge it with 
Flour, then put about an ounce of Butter into a basting ladle, 
ad as it melts baste the bird therewith. 

Keep it at a distance from the fire for the first half hour, that it 

nay warm gradually, then put it nearer, and when it is plump- 

xl up, and the steam draws in toward the fire, it is nearly 

snough, then dredge it lightly ^ith flour and put a bit of butter 

10^ your basting ladle, and as it melts, baste the turkey with it;

A very large Turkey, will require about three hoara, to roast 
it thoroughly ; a midmng $ized one, of eight or teD poaods 
(which is far nicer eating than the very large one,) about two 
hours ; a Small one may be done in an hour and a half. Tuk- 
KGY Poults are of various sizes, and will take about ao hour 
a half-^they should be trussed with their legs twisted under 
like a Duck, and the bead under the wing like a Pheasant. 

Fried Pork Sausages, (No. 87,) are a very savoury and 

favourite accompaniment to either roasted or boiled Pouhry. A 

Turkey, thus garnished, is called ** an Alderman in Chains,^* 

Satisage meat is sometimes used as stuffing, instead of the 

ordinary Forcemeat, (No. 376,) &c. 

Mem. If you wish a Turkey, especiaUy a very large one, 
to be tender, never dress it till at least four or five days (in cold 
weather, eight or ten) after it has been killed. *^ No man who 
understands good living, will say on such a day will I eat that 
Turkey — but will hang it up by four of the large tail-feathers, 
and when, on paying his morning visit to the larder, he finds it 
laying on a cloth, prepared to receive it when it falls, that day 
let it be cooked.*' 

Send up with them. Oyster, (No. 278,) Egg, (No. 267,) 
Bread, (No. 221,) and plenty of Gravy Sauce, (No. 329.) To 
HASH Turkey, (No. 633.) 

Mem. Some Epicures are very- fond of the Gizzard and 
Rump peppered and salted, and broiled — see (No. 538,) 
" how to dress a Devil with veritable SatLce d'Enfer ! /" 

Capons or Fowls, — (No. 58.) 

Must be killed a couple of days in moderate, and more ia 
cold, weather, before they are dressed, or they will eat tough: 
a good criterion of the ripeness of Poultry for the Spit, is the 
ease with whirh you can then pull out the feathers — and when 
a Fowl is plucked, leave a few to help you to ascertain this. 

They are managed exact'y in the same manner, and sent up 
with the same sauce as a Turkey, only they require proportion- 
ably less time at the fire : —

(Nos. 374, 5, 6 and 7 ;) put in pleoty of it, so as to plump out 
the fowl, which must be tied dosely (both at the neck and 
rump), to keep in the stuffing. 

Some cooks put the Liver of the Fowl into this forcemeat, 
and others rub it up with flour and butter, to thicken, and gi?e 
flavour to the Gravy ; see (No. 287.) 

When the Bird is stufled and trussed, score the Gizzard nie^ 
ly — dip it into melted butter — ^let it drain, and then season it 
with Cayenne and Salt — put it under one pinion, and the Liver 
under the other — to prevent it getting hardened or scorched, 
cover it with double paper buttered. 

Take care that your Roasted poultry be well hroumedi it is 
as indispensable, that roa»ted poultry ^ould have a rich Brown 
complexion, as hoUed poultry should have a delicate fVhUe one. 

Oh. " The Art of f aliening Poultry for the London Market, is a 
considerable branch of rural Economy in some convenient situations 
-^aiid consists in supplying them with plenty of healthy food, and 
confining them — and Ducks and Geese must be prevented from going 
into water, which prevents them from becoming fat— and they also 
thereby require a rancid fishy taste. * They are pat in a dark place 
and crammed with a paste made of Barley Meal, mutton suet, and 
some Treacle or coarse Sugar mixed with milk, and are found to be 
completely ripe in a fortnight. If kept longer, the fever that is indu- 
ced by this continual state of repletion, renders them red and unsale- 
able, and frequently kills them." — But Exercise is as indispensable to 
health of Poultry, as other creatures, — without it, the Fat will be all 
accumulated in the cellular membrane, instead of being dispersed 
through its system. ST' See Appendix. 

.•Fowls which are fattened artificially, are by some Epicures prefer- 
red to those called Barn-Door Fowls — whom we have heard say, that 
they should as soon think of ordering a Barn-Door for Dinner — as a 
Bam-Door Fowl. 

The Age of Poultry, makes all the difierehce >— nothing is tender- 
er than a young Chicken, — few things are tougher than an old Cock 
or Hen, which Is oiSly fit to make Broth. The meridian of perfection 
of Poultry, is just before they have come to their full growth be- 
fore they have begun to harden.

146 ROASTING. 

Goose. (No. 59.) 

\ Wbeo a Goose is well picked, singed, and cleaned, make the 

I Stuffing with about two ounces of Onion*, and half as much 
Green Sage, chop them very fine, adding four ounces, i.e. about 
a large breakfast-cupful of stale Bread crumbs, and a very little 
Pepper and Salt, (to this some Cooks add half the Livert, 
parboiling it first,) the yolk of an egg or two, and incorporating | 

the whole well together, stuffthe Goose ; do not quite fill it, but | 

leave a little room for the stuffing to swell. Spit it, tie on the 
spit at both ends, to prevent its swinging round, and to keep 
the stuffing from coming out. From an hour and a half to two 

« If jou think the flavour of raw OnioDg too strong, cut them in 
slicesi and lay them in cold water for a couple of hours, or add as 
much Apple or Potatoe as you have of onion. 

t Although the whole is rather too luscious for the lingual nerves of 
the good folks of Great Britain, the Livers of Poultry are considered 
a very high relish by our Continental neighbours ; and the folfowing \ 

directions how to procure them in perfection, we copy from the Rec- 
ipe of " tin Vieil Amateuf de Bonne Chert ; — ' 

*^ The Liver of a Duck, or a Groose, who has submitted to the rules ' 
and orders that men of taste have invented for the amusement of his 
sebaceous glands, is a superlative exquisite to the palate of a Parisian 
Epicure — but, alas, the poor goose, to produce this darling dainty, 
must endure sad torments. He must be crammed with meat, deprir 
ved of drink, and kept constantly before a hot fire — a miserable mar- 
tyrdom indeed — and would be truly intolerable, if his reflections, on 
the consequences of his suflerings, did not aflbrd him some consola- 
i tion — ^but the glorious prospect of the delightful growth of his liver, 

gives him courage and support ; and when he thinks, how speedily it 
will become almost as big as his Body — ^how high it will rank on the 
list of double relishes — and with what ecstasies it will be eaten by the 
fanciers ^' dts Foies gras" he submits to his destiny without a sigh — 
The famous Slrasbourg Pies are made with Livers thus prepared-, 
and sell for an enormous price." 

However incredible this ordonnance for the obesitation of a Goose's 
[ Liver may appear at first sight — will it not seem equally so to after 

[ ages, that in this enlightened country, in 1821, we encouraged a Fol- 

[ ly as much greater — as its operation was more universal ! — Will it be 

^ ^believed, that it was then considered the acme of perfection in Beef 

and Mutton that it should be so over-fattened, that a poor man, to 
obtain one pound of Meat he could eat,— -must purshase another 
which he could not, unless converted into a Suet Pudding— -moreover, 
that the highest Premiums were annually awarded to those who pro- 
duced Sheep and'Oxen in* the most extreme state of morbid ObcHtjif

Obs. " Goott'/eeding in the vicinity of the metropolis it lo larg^e 

a concern, that One person annually feeds for market, upwards of 

5000." ** A Goose on a farm in Scotland taro years since, of the 

, clearly ascertained age of 89 years, healthy and Tigorous, was killed 

by a Sow while sitting over her Eggs ; it was supposed she might 

have lived many years, and her fecundity appeared to he permanent. 

Other Geese have been proved to reach the age of 70 years." — Mou- 

BRAT on Poultry f p. 40. 

It appears in Dr. St avk^9 Experimenis on DUt, p.llO^that ''when 
he fed upon Roasted Goose — ^he was more vigorous both in Body 
and Mind, than with any other diet." 

The Goose at MichatlmaSf is as famous in the mouths of the mil- 
lion, as the Minced Fie at Christmas ; J3ut^ for th^e who eat with 
delicacy, it is by that time too foU grown. The true period, when the 
Goose is in its highest perfection, is when it ha« just acquired its ftiU 
growth, and not begun to harden. If the Midsummer goo»e is insip- 
id, the Michaelmas goose is rank.^ the fine time, is between both : See 
Mock Gfoe<e, (No. 61). 

Green Goose, (No. (Kk) 

Geese are called Green, till they are about four mouths old. 
The only difference between roasting these, and a full grown 
Goose, consists in seasoaiog it with pepper and salt instead of 
sage and onion, and roasting it for forty or fifty minutes only. 

O&s. This is one of the least desirable of those insipid pre- 
mature productions — which are esteemed dainties.

For the following obeervations, I am indebted to Major 
Hawkbr^s entertaining and informing work, ** In^rwotmuifir 

Young Sportsmen** London, 1810. 

" Old Pheatantt may l^e distinguished by the length and thmpnets 
of their tpurSf ^hich in the younger ones are fAorl and blunt, 

** Old Partridges are known during the early part of the season, by 
their legs being of a pale blue, Instead of a yellowish broKii; so that 
i%hen a Londoner receives his brace of blue-legged birds in Septem- 
bf r, he should immediately snap their legs and draw out the sinncwa 
by means of pulling off the feet, instead of leaving tfien to torment 
him, like so many strings, when he would be wishing to enjoy his re* 
past. This remedy to make the legs tender, removes the objection to 
old birds, provided the weather will admit of their being sufficiently 
kept ; and indeed they are then often preferable, from having a high- 
er flavour. 

« If Birds are over^kept, their legs will be dry, their eyes much sunk, 
and the vent will become soft, and somewhat discoloured. The first 
place to ascertain if they are beginning to be high, is the inside of 
their bills, wfiere it is not amiss to put some hether straw, or spice, if 
yon want to keep them for any length of time. Birds that have fallen 
Into the water, or have not had time to get cold, shoald not be packed 
like others, but sent openly, and dressed as soon as possible." 

Sportsmen are often heartily abused by their acquaintance, 
(I cannot yet bring myself to hackney the word friends quite so 
fluently as I ought to do,) for sending them * tough and good- 
for-nothing game,' while probably the blame should, in many 
instances, rest with themselves, or their pudding-headed cook, 
vrhOy may bo, dresses an old pheasant or hare the very day after 
it was killed ; or perhaps, while engrossed in a story or argu- 
ment, leaves it to roast away, till their remains neither juice nor 
flavour. AH game should he kept till properly tender. The 
following sauce for wild fowl has been preferred to abput fifty

To preserve the Fat, make a paste of flour and water, as 
much as will cover the haunch, wipe it with a dry cloth in every 
part, rub a large sheet of paper all over with butter, and cover 
the Veoison with it, then roll out the paste about three quarters 
of an inch thick, lay this over all the fat side, and cover it with 
three or four sheets of strong white paper, and tie it securely on 
with packthread : have a strong close fire, and baste your veni- 
son as soon as you lay it down to roast, (to prevent the paper 
and string from burning ) ; it must be well basted at the time. 

A Buck haunch generally weighs from SO to 25 pounds, 
will take about four hours and a half roasting, in warm, and 
longer in Cold weather, a Haunch of from 1^ to 18 pounds 
ivill be done in about three or three and a half. A quarter of 
an hour before it is done, the string must be cut, and the paste 
carefully taken off; now baste it with butter, dredge it lightly 
with flour, and when the froth rises, and it has got a fine light 
brown colour, garnish the Knuckle-bone with a ruffle of cut

Neck and Shoulder of Veftisonr"^ (No. 64,) 

Are to be meoaged in the same way as the hauoch ; only 
they do not require the coat or paste, and will not require 
80 much time. 

The best way to spit a neck, is to put three skewers through, 
and put the spit between the skewers and the boues. 

A Fawn^-^ (No. 65.) 

Like a sucking Pig, should be dressed, almost, as soon as 
killed. When very young, is trussed, stuffed, and spitted the 
same way as a Hare. But they are better eating when of the 
size of a House Lamb ; and are then roasted in quarters ; the 
hind quarter is the most esteemed. 

They must be put down to a very quick fire, and either 
basted all the time they are roasting, or be covered with sheets 
of fat bacon ; when done, baste it with butter, and dredge it 
with a little salt and flour, till you make a nice froth on it. 

N. B. Vie advise our friends to half roast a fa\!vn as soon as 
they receive if — and then make a Hash of it like (No. 528.)

<* Iruer quadrupeie* gloria prima i<;^t(#.'*— If ardal. 

The first points of consideration are. How old is the Hare 1 
and how long bae it been killed ? When young, it is easy of 
digestion, and very nourishing ; — when old, the contrary in 
every respect. 

To ascertain the age, examine the first joint of the fore foot ; 
you will find a small knob, if it is a Levcrret, which disappears 
as it grows older ; then examine the ears ; if they tear easily, 
it will eat tender ; if they are tough, so will be the hare, which 
we advise you to n^ake into Soup, (No. 141,) or stew ; or joo 
it, see (No. 523.)

and send it up as a garnish in little hillocks round the ditb. 
"Wipe the Hare quite dry, rub the inside with pepper, and bang 
it up in a dry cool place.

three times ; lay it in a clean cloth, and dry it well ; thea 
tross it. 

To make the Stuffing, see (No. 379 :) do not make it too 
tbin ; it should be of cohesive consistence ; if it is not soffi* 
cientiy stiff, it is good for nothing : put this mto the belly, sew 
it up tight, cut the neck skin to let the blood out, or it will never 
appear to be done enough, spit it, and baste it with dripping8,f 
(jot the juices of the Back will be dried up before the upper 
joints of the Legs are half done,) till you think it is nearly done» 
which a middling sized Hare will be in about an hour and a 
quarter. When it is almost roasted enough, pat a little bit of 
butter into your basting-ladle, and baste it with this, and flour 
it, and froth it nicely. 

Serve it with good Gravy, (No. 329) or (No. 347) and Cur- 
rant-jelly. For another Stuffing, see receipt (No. 379). 
Some Cooks cut off the bead and divide it, and lay one half on 
each side the Hare. 

Cold roast Hare will make excellent Soup (No. 241), chop-

ious palate will have no reason to regret that the Game Season 
is over. To make this into Hare Soup, see (No. 241). 

Rabbit. (No. (57.) 

If your fire is clear and sharp, thirty minutes will roaat a 
young, and forty a full grown Babbit. 

When you lay it down, baste it with butter, and. dredge it, 
ligfat'y and carefully with flour, that you may have it frothy 
and of a fine light brown. While the rabbit is roasting, boil 
its Liver* with some Parsley ; when tender, chop them togeth- 
er, and put half the mixture into some melted butter, reserving 
the other half for Garnish^ divided into little hillocks* Cat off 
the heady and lay half on each side of the dish. 

06s. A large, well grown, (but young) warren-rabbit, kept 
some time after it has been killed, and roasted with a stuffing ia 
its belly, eats very like a Hare, to the nature of which it ap- 
proaches ; it is nice nonrisbing food when young, but hard and 
unwholesome when old. For Sauces, (Nos. 398, 287, and 
329). 

Pheasant— (No. 68.) 

Requires a smart fire, but not a fierce one. Thirty minutes 
will roast a young bird ; and forty or fifty a full grown Phea- 
sant Pick and draw it, cut a slit in the back of the neck, and 
take out the craw, but don't cut the^ad off; wipe the inside 
of the bird with a clean cloth, twist the legs close to the body, 
leave the feet on, but cut the toes ofi^, donU turn the head under 
the wing, but truss it like a fowl, it is much easier to carve : 
baste it, butter and froth it^ and prepare eeuce for it, (Nos. 321 
aad 329) : see the instructions in receipts to roast fowls and 
turkeys, (No. 67 and bS).

154 ROASTING. 

Mock Pheasant, (No. 69.) 

If yoa have ooly one pbeasaDt, and wish for a c^mpaDioD 
for it, get a fine yooog fowl, of as near as may be the same 
size as the bird to be matched, and make game of it by truss- 
ing it like the pheasant, and dressing it according to the abore 
directions. Few persons will discover the pheasant from tbe 
fowl, especially if the latter has been kept four or five days. 

The peculiar flavour of the Pheasant (like that of other game) 
is principally acquired by long keeping. 

Guinea and Pea Fowls — (Nob 69*.) 
Are dressed in the sanie way as Pheasants. 

Partridges — (No. 70.) 

Are cleaned and trussed in the same maaner as a phea»f>)) 
(but the ridiculous custom of tucking the legs into each other, 
makes them very troublesome to carve) ; the breast is so plump, 
it will require almost as much roasting ; send up with tbero rioe 
sauce, (No 321*,) or Bread sauce (No. 321,) and good gravy, 
(No. 3290 

%* tfyou wish to preserve them longer than you tAtai 
they will keep good unmessed, half roast theniy they will keep 
ttoo or three days longer ^ or make a Pie of them. 

Black Cock, (No. 7 1 ,) Moor Game, (No. 72,) Grouse (No. 73.) 
Are all to be dreased like partridges ; the Black Cock will 
take as much time as tbe pheasant, and Moor game and Grouse, 
as the partridge. Send up with them Curraat jelly and fried 
Bread crumbs, (No. 320.) 

fVUd Ducks. (No. 74) 

For roasting a Wild Duck, you must have a clear brisk fire* 
and a hot spit ; it must be browned on the outside, without 
being sodden within. To have it well frothed and full of gr>' 
vy, is the nicety. Prepare the fire, by stirring and raking '* 
just before the bird is laid down, and fifteen or twenty loioutes 
will do it in the fashionable way ; but if you like it a little more 
done, allow it a few minutes longer : if it is too much, it will 
lose its flavour. 

For the sauce, see (No 338, and No. 62.) 

Widgeons and Teal — - (No. 75.) 

Are dressed exactly as the wild duck ; only that less tiins is 
requisite for a Widgeon, and still less for a Teal. 



QOAStINO* 155 

Woodcocks. (No. 76,) 

. Woodcocks should not be drawn, as the trail is by the lovers 
of *' hunU goui^ considered a *' Bonne Bouche ;'* trass their 
legs close to the body, and ran an iron skewer throngh each 
thigh close to the body, and tie them on a small bird spit, pat 
to roast at a clear fire ; cut as many slices of bread as you have 
birds, toast or fry them a delicate brown, and lay them in the 
dripping pan under the birds, to catch the Trailf ; baste them 
with butter, and froth them with flour ; lay the toast on a hot 
dish, and the birds on the toast; pour some good beef grary 
into the dish, and send up some in a boat, see Obs. to (No. $%9 :) 
twenty or thirty minutes will roast them. Garnish with slices of 
lemon. 

Obs. — Sonie Epicures like this bird Tery much underdone, 
and direct, that a Woocock should be just introduced to the 
Cook, for her to show it the Fire, and then send it up to the 
Table. 

Snipes^-^ (No. 77.) 

Difl&r little from Woodcocks, unless in size ; they are to 
be dressed in the same way, but require about five minutes less 
time to roast them. 

For Sauce, see No. 340. 

Pigeons. (No. 78.) 

When the pigeons are ready for roasting, if you are desired 
to stnff them, chop some green parsley very fine, the liver, and 
a bit oC butter together, with a little pepper and salt, or with 
the stuffing ordered for a fillet of veal, (No. 374, or No. 375,) 
and fill the belly of each bird with it. They will be enough 
in about twenty or thirty minutes : send up parsley and butter, 
(No. 261,) in the dish under them, and some in a boat, and gar- 
nish with crisp parsley, (No. 318,) or Fried Bread Crumbs, 
(No. 320,) or Bread Sauc^, (321.) or Gravy, (No. 329.)

0&«.*— When Pigeons are fmb^ they have their fall relish ; 
bat It goes entirely off with a very little keeping, nor is it any 
way so well preserved, as by roasting them — when they afe 
pat into a Pie» they are gieaerally baked to rags^ and taste 
more of pepper and salt than any thing else. 

A little ntelted Butter may be put into the dish with them, 
and the gravy that raos from them will mix with it into fine 
sauce. FiOEOHs art in the greatest pevfeciion from Midstrni" 
mtr to Miohaebnaa^ there is then the most plentiful and best 
food for them; aod their finest growth, is just when they are 
full feathered. When they are in the pen-feathers, they an 
fiabby4 when they are full grown, and have flown some time, 
they are tough. Uame and Poultry are the best when iheyhaoe 
just done graunng^ i e. as soon as nature has per^tad het 
work.

Larks and other small Birds, (No. 80.) 

These delicate little birds are in high season in November. 
When they are picked, gutted and cleaned, truss them ; brush 
them with the yolk of an egg, and roll them in bread crumbs ; 
spit them on a lark spit, and tie that on a larger spit, ten or 
fifteen minutes at a quick fire will be enough ; baste them with 
fresh butter while they are roasting, and sprinkle them with 
bread crumbs till they are well covered with them. 

For sauce fry some grated bread in clarified butter, (see No. 
959.) and set it to drain before the fire, that it may harden : 
serve the crumbs under the Larks when you dish them, and gar- 
nish them with slices of Lemon. 

fVheat Ears-- (No. d 1 .) 

Are dressed in the same way as Larks.

FRYING. 

To darifif Drippmg$. (No. 83.) 

Pot your dripping into a clean saucepan ove/ a glove or slow 
%S9 : when it is josi going to boil, skim it well, let it boil, and 
then let it stand till it is a little cooled, then pour it through a 
sieve into a pan, 

P6<.— Well cleansed Dnpptfigs*, and the fat Skim^ 

* Mrs. Mklbok, in her Eeon&mieai Cookery ^ page 7, tells lu, the 
has ascertained from actual experiments, that ** the Drtpptngt of 
Roast Meat, combined with Wheat, Flour, Oatmeal, Barley, Pease, or 
Potatoe Starch, w ill make delicious Soup, agreeable and savourj to 
the Palate, and natritive and serviceable to the Stomach, and that 
while a joint is roasting, good Soup may be made from the drippings 
of the Fat, which is the Euence ofJIStaif as seeds are of Vegetables, 
and impregnates Sovp with the identical iatte of Meat.'* 

** Writers on Cookery give strict directions to carefully skim off the 
Faij and in the next sentence order Butter (a much more expensive 
article) to be added^ — instead of this, when any Fat appears at the 
top of your Soup or Stew, do not <Atm it off, but unite Jt with the 
broth by means of the vegetable mucilages. Flour, Oatmeal, Ground 
Barley, or Potatoe Starch ; when suspended, the Soup is equally 
agreeable to the palate, and nutritive to the stomach," &c. 

" Cooks bestow a great deid of pains to make Gravies ; they stew 
and boil lean meat for hours, and after all their Cookery tastes move 
of Pepper and Salt than any things else.— If they would add the buUt 
of a chesnut of solid Fat to a common siaed sauce- boatftil of Gravy, 
It will give it more sapidity than twenty-four hotars stewing lean meat 
would, unless a larger quantity was used than is warranted by the 
rales of frugality." See (Nos. 205 and 220.) 

« Tb^ experiments of Dr. Stark on th? nourishing powers of differ- 
ent substances, go very far to prove that three ounces of the Fat of 
Boiled Beef are equal to a pound of the Lean. Dr. Pagetf the travel- 
ler, confirms this opinion. < Being obliged,* says he, * during the jour-

mings*, of the Broth pot, when fresh and sweet, will baste ev- 
ery thing as well as Butter, except game and poultry, and 
should supply the place of butter for com moo fries, &c. for 
which they ate equal to lard, especially if you repeat the clari- 
fying twice over. 

N.B. If you keep it in a cool place, you may preserve it a 
fortnight in summer, and longer in winter. When you have 
done Frying, let the dripping stand a few minutes to settle, 
and then pour it through a sieve into a clean Basin or stone 
Pan ; and it will do a second and a third time as well as it did 
the fir8t,-*~only the Fat you have fried Fish la must not be 
used for any other purpose. 

To clarify Sueif to fry with. . (No. 84.} 

Cut Beef or Mutton suet into thin slices, pick out all the 
veins and skins, &c. ; put it into a thick and well tinned sauce- 
pan« and set it over a very slow s^eve, or in an oven, till it is 
melted : you must not hurry it, — if not done very slowly it 
will acquire a burnt taste, which you cannot get rid of; — tbea 
strain it through a hair sieve into a clean brown pan. Wkea 
quite cold, tie a paper over it and keep it for use. Hog*8-lard 
is prepared in the same way, 

06s. — The waste orcasioned by the present absurd fashioQ 
of over-feeding cattle-^till the Fat is nearly equal to the Leao^ 
may, by good management, be in some measure prevented,—- 
by cutting off the superfluous part, and preparing it as above, 
or by making it into Puddings, see (Nos. 551 and 554,) or 
Soup (No. 239.) 



ney from North to South America by land, to live solely on Animal 
food, I experienced the truth of what is observed by Hunter»,who live 
solely on Animal Food, viz. that besides their receiving little nourish- 
ment from the leaner parts of it, it soon becouies offensive to theXaste, 
whereas the Fat is both more nutritive, and continues to be agreeable 
to the Palate. To many stomachs Fat is unpleasant and Indige^-^i- 
ble, especially when converted into oil by heat : this may be easily 
prevented by the simple process of combining the Fat completely with 
water, by the intervention of vegetable mucilage, as in melting But- 
ter, by means of flour, the Butter and water are united into'a homo-i 
geneous fluid." — From Practical Economy , by a Phyiician.,

Sieaks, (No. 85.) 

XuVii the steaks rather thinner than for hroiWfig. Pot some 
iButter or (No. 83) into an iron fryingpan, and when it is hot, 
lay in the steaks, and keep tarniog them till they are done 
enough. For Sauce, see (No. 356), and for the aooonpaiM- 
ments, (No. 94.) 

Obs, — Unless the Fire be prepared on purpose, we like this 
way of cooking them ; the gravy is preserved ; and the meat 
is roore equally dressed, and more evenly browned ; which 
makes it more relishing, and invites the eye to encourage the 
Appetite. 

Beef Steaks and Onions, (No. 86.) 

See also (No. 501.) 

Fry the steaks according to the directions given in ihe pro- 
ceeding receipt ; and have ready for them some Onions, pre«

nelted (before it gets hot) put in the Sausages, and shake the 
pao for a minute, and keen turning them, (be careful not to 
break or prick them in so doing), fry them over a very slow 
fire, till they are nicely.hrowned on all sides, — when they are 
done, lay them on a hair sieve, placed before the fire for a 
couple of minutes to drain the fat from them. The seciet of 
fy^ng Sausages, is to let them gel hot very gradually, — they 
then will not burst, if they are not stale. 

The common practice to prevent them bursting, is to prick 
them with a fork, but this lets all their Gravy out. 

You m^y froth them by rubbing them with cold fresh but- 
ter, — and lightly dredge them with flour, and put them in a 
cheese toaster or Dutch oven for a minute. 

Some oveT'economical Cooks, insist that no butter or lard, 
&c. is required ; their own fat being sufficient to fry them ; — 
we have tried ii, — the Sausages were partially scorched, and 
had that pye^bald appearance, that fried things liave when suf- 
ficient fat is not allowed.

Chops or Steaks*. (No. 04.) 

To Stew them, see (No. 500,) ditto with Onions (No. 501.) 
Those who are nice about Steaks, never attempt to have 
thevny except in weaiker which permits the meat to be hung tiU 
it is tender — and give the Butcher some dap notice of their 
wish for. them. 

The best Steaks are those cut ffom the middle of a Rurop, 
that has been killed at least four days in moderate weather,—- 
mncb longer in cold weather-— when they can be cut about six 
inches long, four inches wide, and half an inch thick — ^o not 
beat them, unless you suspect they will not be tender. Desire 
the Butcher to cut them of even thickness — ^if he does not, 
divide the thicker from the thinner pieces, and give them tim9 
accordingly. 

Take care to have a very clear brisk fire, throw a little salt 
on it, make the Gridiron hot, and set it slanting, to prevent the 
fat from dropping into the lire, and making a smoke. It re- 
quires more practice and care than is generally supposed to do 
Steaks to a nicety ; and for want of these little attentions, this 
very common dish, which every body is supposed capable of 
dressing, seldom comes to the table in perfection. 

* The season for these is from the 29th of September to the 25th of 
March ; to ensure their being tender when out of season, stew them 
as in Receipt (No. 500.)

COOK'S ORACLE. 

VEGETABLES. 

Sixteen ways op Dressing Potatoes.* 

(No. 102.) 

The Vegetable Kiogdom affords no Food more wboIeMine>. 
more easily procured, easily prepared, or less expensive than 
the Potatoe ; yet although this most useful vegetable is dressed 
almost every day, in almost every family^— for One plate of 
Potatoes that comes to table as it should. Ten are spoiled. 

Be careful in your choice of Potatoes ; no vegetable varies 
so much in colouc, size, shape, consistence, and flavour. 

The reddish coloured are better than the white, but the yel- 
iowish looking ones are the best. Choose these of a moderate 
size, free from blemishes, and fresh, and buy them in the 
Mould ; they must not he wetted till they are cleaned to he 
cooked. Protect them from the Air and Frost — by laying them 
in heaps in a cellar, covering them vrith mats, or burying them 
io sand or in earth. The action of Frost — is most destructive 
— ^if it be considerable, the life of the vegetable is destroyed, 
and the Potatoe speedily rots. 

Wash tbero, but do not pare or cut them unless they are 
very large, — fill a saucepan half full of Potatoes of equal sf2f»+ 
(or make them so by dividing the larger ones) put to them as 
much rold water as wiil cover them about an iiurb : they are 
sooner boiled, and more savoury than when drowned in water 
— most boiled things are spoiled by having too little water, but 

*** Next to Bread there is oo vegetable ftrtiele, 4he preparatioD of which, as food, 
deserve* to be more auended to, than the Potatoe '*->Sir John SmciairU C»de qf 
Health, vol. i. p, 354. 

** By the Anatyait ^Potatoe, it appears that 16 ounces contained 11 1.2 ounces of 
water— and the 4 1-2 ounces of solid parts remaining afforded scarce a drachm of 
earth."— l*<M-«ienter** Obs. en NtUritive Vegetables. 8?o. 1783, p. la. 

t Of the 4maU 9fU4 will be done to pietes before the large met are boiled enough. 



168 VSGETABLES. 

Potatoes are often spoiled by too much ; tbf y must merely be 
cofered, aod a little allowed for waste ia boiling, so that ibey 
■lay be just covered at the fioisH. 

Set them on a moderate fire till they boil, then take ibero off, 
and set them by tbe side of the fire to simmer slowly till tbey 
are soft eoougb to admit a fork, — (place no dependeoce oo the 
usual test of their skin crackiug, which, if tbey are boiled fast, 
will happen to some Potatoes when they are not half done, aod 
the ioside is quite hard,)— then pour the water off, (if you let 
the Potatoes remain in the water a moment after tbey aredooe 
eoougb — ^tfaey will become waxy and watery,) uncover tbe 
saucepan, and set it at such a distance from the fire as will se- 
cure it from bnrniog ; their superfluous moisture will evaporate^ 
and the Potatoes will be perfectly dry and mealy. 

Too may afterwards place a napkin, folded up to the size of 
the saucepan*s diameter, over the Potatoes, to -keep them hot 
and mealy till wanted. 

06s.«— This method of managing Potatoes is in every respect 
equal to steaming them ; and they are dressed in half the tine. 

There is such an infinite variety of sorts and sizes of Pota- 
toes, that it is impossible to say how long tbey will take do- 
ing ; the best way is to try them with a fork. Moderate sized 
Potatoes will generally be enough in fifteen or twenty mioatss. 
See 068. to (No. 106.) 

CM Pot$io€B Fried. (No. 103.*) 

Put a bit of dean Dripping into a frying-pan ; when it is 
melted, slice in your Potatoes with a little pepper and salt, put 
them on the fire, keep stirring them ; — when tbey are quite bot, 
they are ready. 

06s. — Tbis is a very good way of re-dressing Potatoes— or 
See (No. 106.) 

Potatoes hoUed and broiled, (No. 103.) 

Dress your Potatoes .as before directed, and put them ooa

lard boils, and is still, put in the slices of4)otatoe, and keep 
moving them till they are crisp ; take them up and lay them to 
drain on a sieve ; send them up with a very little salt sprinkled 
orerthem. 

Potatoes fried whole. (No. 105.) 

When nearly boiled enough, as directed in (No 103.) put 
them into a stewpan with a- bit of butter, or some nice clean 
beef drippings ; shake them about often (for fear of burning 
them,) till they are brown and crisp : drain them from the fat. 

06s.«— It will be an elegant improvement to the three last re- 
ceipts, previous to frying or broiling the Potatoes, to flour them 
and dip them in the yolk of an 9ggy and then roll them in the 
fine sifted bread crumbs; they will then deserve to be called

in a little water, and cut about two ounces of fresh butter into 
HttJe bits, and lay them on the top ; cover it close with puff 
paste. It will take about an hour and a half to bake it. 

N. B. The Yolks of four Eggs (boiled hard) may be added ; 
and when baked, a tabjespoonful of good Mushroom Catsup 
poured in through a funnel. 

Obs. — Cauliflowers divided into mouthfuls, and Button On- 
ions, seasoned with Curry powder, &c. make a favourite Veget- 
able Pie. 

New Potatoes, (No. 116.) 

The best way to clean New Potatoes, is to rub them with 
coarse cloth or a flannel, or scrubbing-brush ; and proceed as 
in (No. 192.) 

N. B. New Potatoes are poor, watery, and insipid till 
they are full two inches diameter — they are hardly worth the 
trouble of boiling before Midsummer Day. 

Obs. — Some Cooks prepare Sauces to pour over Potatoes, 
made with butter, salt, and pepper, — or gravy, or mehed but- 
ter and catsup, — or stew the Potatoes in ale, or water seasoned

N. B. They should be covered with thick melted butter, of a 
nice White or Brown Sauce. 

Cabbage. (No. 118.) 

' Pick Cabbages very clean, and wash them thoroughly, then 
look them over carefully again ; quarter them if they are very 
large. Put them into a saucepan Yf\ih plenty of boiling vtU'- 
ter ; if any sCum rises, take it off, put a large spoonful of salt 
into the saucepan, and boil them till the stalks feel tender. A 
Young Cabbage will take about twenty minutes, or half an 
hour — when Fidl Gfrtnm, near an hour ; see that they are well 
covered with water all the time, and that no smoke or dirt arises 
from stirring the fire. With careful raansgement, they will 
look as beautiful when dressed, as they did wbea growing. 

06s. — Some Cooks say, that it will much ameliorate the 
flavour of strong Old Caibc^es to boil them in two waters ; 
i. e, when they are half done, to take them out, and put them 
directly into another saucepan of boiling water, instead of con- 
tinuing them in the water into which they were first put. 

BoUed Cabbage fried. (No. 110.) 

See receipt for Bubble and Squeak. 

Savoys (No. 120.) 

Are boiled in the same manner ; quarter them when you 
send them to table. 

Sprouts and Young Greens. (No. 121.) 

The Receipt we have written for Cabbages will answer as 
well for Sprouts, only they will be boiled enou^ in fifteen or 
twenty minutes. 

Spinage, (No. 122.) 

SpinagS shoiild be picked a leaf at a time, and washed in 
three or four waters ; when perfectly clean, h^ it on a sieve or 
cullender, to drain the water from it. 



VEGETABIiXS. 173 

Put a saucepan on the fire, three parts fiUed vrkh water, aod 
large enough for the Spioage to float in it ; pat a small hand- 
ful of salt ia it, let it boil, ^im it, aod then put in the Spinaga, 
make it boil as quick as possible till quite tender, prnsiDg the 
Spinage down frequently that it may be done equally ; it will 
be enough in about ten minutes, if boiled in plenty of water ; 
if the Spinage is a little old, gtre it a few minutes longer. 
When done, strain it on the back of a sieve, sque^e it dry with 
a plate, or between two trenchers, chop it fine, and put it into 
a stewpan^with a bit of butter and a little salt ; a little cream is 
a great improreroent, or, instead of either, some rich Gravy. 
Spread it in a dish, and score it into squares of proper size to 
belp at table. 

0&8. — Grated nutmeg, or mace, and a little lemon juice, is a 
favourite addition with some cooks, and is added when you . 
stir it up in the stewpan with the butter garnished. Spinage is- 
frequently served with Poached Eggs with fried bread. 

AspaaraguB^ (No. 133.) 

Set a stewpan with plenty of water in it on the^re ; sprinkle 
a handful of salt'init, let it boil, and skim it : then put in your 
Asparagus, prepared thus :«-^rape all the stalks till they are 
perfectly clean, throw them into a pan of cold water as you 
scrape them ; when they are all done, tie them up in little bun- 
dles, of about a quarter hundred each, with bass, if you can 
get it, or tape ; string cuts them to pieces : cut off the stalks at 
the bottom, that they may be all of a length, leaving only just- 
enough to serve as ahandle for to green part ; when they aro 
tender at the stalk, whicb wiUboin from twenty to thirty- min- 
utes, tbey are done enoughs Qreat earn must be taken to 
watch the exact time of their becoming tender ; take them up 
jast at that instant, and they will have their true flavoul%nd 
colour ; — a minute or two more boiling destroys both. 

While the Asparagus is boiling, t^as^a round of a quartern

close off at the bottom, and put into the pan of cold water. 

When the water in the stewpan boils, and the Brocoli is 
ready, put it in, let it boil briskly till the stalks feel tender, from 
ten to twenty minutes ;«— 4akf it up with a slice, that you may 
not break it ;•— let it drain aiid aerre up. 

If some of the beads of Brocoli are much bigger than t!ie

Parsnips (No. 148.) 

Are to be cooked just in the same maooer as Carrots ; 
they require more or less time according to their size, therefore 
match them in size, and you most try them, by thrusting » fork 
into them as they are in the water ; when that goes easily 
througb,they are done enough : boil them from an hour to two 
hours, according to their size and freshness. 

06s. — Parsnips are sometimes sent op mashed in the same 
way as Turnips, and some cooks quarter them before they boil 
them. 

Carrots. (No. 139.) 

Let them be, well washed and brushed, not scraped ; an hour 
is enough for young spring carrots ; grown carrots most be cut 
in haif, and will take from an hour and a half to two hours and 
a half. When done, rub off the peels with a clean coarse cloth, 
and slice them in two or four, according to their size. The 
best way to try if they are done enough, is to pierce them with 
a fork. 

Obs, — Many people are fond of cold Carrot with cold Beef. 

Turnips. (No. 130.) 

Peel off half an inch of the stringy outside ; full grown

water, with a little salt dissolved in it, standing before you, and 
as the beans are cleaned and stringed, throw them in: — when 
all are done^.put them on the fire, in boiling water, with some 
salt in it ; when ibey have boiled fifteen or twenty minutes, 
take one out and taste it ; as soon as they are tender, take them 
up, throw them into a cullender or sieve to drain.. To send 
up the beans whole is much the best method when they.are thus 
young, aud their delicate flavour and colour are orach better 
preserved. When a little more grown, they must be cut across 
m two, after stringing _; and for common tables, they are split, 
and divided across ; but those whaare nice, never have them 
at such a growth as to require splitting. When they are large, ' 
they look very pretty cut into Lozenges.

Green Ptase.^ (No. 134) 

Young Green Pease, well dressed, are one of the most deli- 
cious delicades of the vegetable kingdom. They must be 
young ; it is equally indispensable that they be fresh gathered^ 
and cooked as soon as they are sheUed^ for they soon lose both 
their colour and sweetness. 

If you wish to feast upon Pease in perfection, you must 
have them gathered the same day they are dressed, and put on 
to boil within half an hour after they are shelled.

mada (or tha purposa of saparattog^ tham. This precaution i& 
neoeasary, for large and snail paasa caiwot be boiled toeether, 
as the former will take more time than the latter. 

For a peck of pease, set on a saacepan with a gallon of wa« 
t€Nr in it; when it boils, put in your pease with a tablespoon* 
ful of salt,-*skim it well, keep them boiling quick from twenty 
to thirty, minutes, according to their age and size : the best way 
to judge of their being done enough, and indeed the only way 
to make sure of cooking them to,, and not beyond the point of 
perfection, or as Pea-eaters say, of '* boiling them to a hvbhle^^ 
is to take some out with a spoon and taste them. 

When they are enough, drain them on a hair sieve. If you- 
like them buttered, put them into a pie dish, divide some butter 
ifito small bits, and lay them on the pease ; put another dish 
over them, and tunor diam ofer and over ; this will melt the but- 
ter dirough them, but as all people do not like buttered pease, 
yoa had better send them to table plain, as they come out of 
the Saucepan, with melted butter (No. 256,) in a sauce tureen* 
It is usual to boil soma Mint with the Pease, but if you wish to 
garnish the Pease with Mint, boil a few sprigs in a saucepan by 
themselves. See Sage and Onion Sauce, (No. 300,) and Pea 
Powder, (No. 458.) To boil Bacon, (No. 13,) Indices of Earn 
and Bacon, (No. 626,) Aud Relishing Rashers of Bacon, (No. 
527.) 

N. B. A Peck of young Pease will not yield more than 
enough for a couple of hearty Pea-Eaters, — >when the pods are 
f ull^ it may serve fpr three. 

Mem.— Never think of purchasing Pease rMdy'sheUed, for- 
the cogent reasons assigned io the first part of this Receipt*

Cucumber Stewed. (No. 1 35.) 

Peel and cut Cucumbers in quarters, take out the seeds, and 
lay them on a cloth to drain off the water : whan they are dry, 
flour and fry them in fresh butter ; let the butter be quite hot 
before you put in the cucumbers ; fry them till they are brown, 
then take them out with an egg slice, and lay them on a sieve to 
drain the fat from them : (some Cooks fry sliced Onions or 
some small Button Onions with them till they are a delicate 
light brown colour, drain them from the fat, and) tt^n put 



178 VKGETABLK5. 

fhrna into a stewpan, with as much Gra? y as will cover diein ; 
stow slowly till they are tender ; take oat the cucnmbers with 
a slice, thicken tie gravy with flour and batter, give it a boil ap, 
season it with pepper and salt, and pat in the Cacumben ; as 
soon as they are warm, they are ready* 

. The above rubbed through a Tammis or fine sieve, will be 
entitled to be called '' Cuoumbbr Savob.'' See (No. 3M,) 
Cucumber Vinegar* This is a very favourite sauce with lamb 
or mutton cutlets, stewed rump steaks, &c. &c. ; when made 
for the latter, a third part of sliced onioa is sometimes fried 
with the cucumber. 

Soak them in cold waterywash- them well, then pot them into 
plenty of boiling water^. with a handful of salt, and let them 
boil gently till they are tender,- which will take en hour and a 
half, or two hours ; the surest wsy to know when they are 
done enough, is to draw out a leaf; trim them and drain them 
on a sieTe ; and send up mehed butter with them, which some 
put into small cups> so that each guest may have oneu. 

Stewid Onions, (No, 137.) 

The large Portugal Ooioos are the best ; take off the top* 
coats of half a dozen of these, (taking care not to cut off the 
tops or tails too near, or the onions will go to pieces) ; and put 
them into a stewpan broad enough to hold them without laying 
them a top of one another, and just cover them with good broth* 

Put thera over a slow fire, and let them simmer about two 
hours ; when you dish them, turn them upside down^ and pour 
the sauce over.

COOK'S ORACLE. 

FISH. 

TurhU to BoU. (No. 140.) 

TbiB^zcellfiot Fishis inseafion dit graatest part of the Sjiio- 
mer^-— wban ^j^oad* it is at odoo finn and tender^ md alnmods 
ifrith rich felatinoas nutrimeat. 

Being *drawD, and washed clean, if it be quite iiresb, by rob- 
bing it lightly with salty and keeping it in a cold place, you may 
in moderate weather preserve it for a couple of days.* 

An Hour or two before you dress itf soak it in spring watflc 
l?ith some salt in it, — then score the skin across & tiricfcest 
part of the back ; (this is to pre?ent it breaking on the Breast, 
which will happen from the fish swelling, and cracking the skin, 
if this precaatioo be not used.) Put a large handful of Salt 
into a fish kettle with cold water, lay your &h on a fish straiii- 
er, put it in, and when it is coming to a boil, ekim it well; 
then set the kettle on the side of the fire, 1o boil as grady as 
possible for about fifteen or twenty minutes; if it boils hstf 
the fish will break to pieces ; supposing it a middling sise Tar- 
bot, and to weigh eight or nine jx>unds. 

Rub a little of the inside Red Cora) spawn** of the Lobster 
through a hair sieve, without butter ; and when the Turbot is 
dished, sprinkle the spawn over it. Garnish the dish with 
sprigs of curled Parsley, sliced Lemon, and finely scraped 
Horaeradisb. 

If you like to send it to table in Full Dress, surround it with 
nicely fried Smelts (No. 173,) laying the largest opposite the 
broadest part of the Turbot, so that they may form a well pro*-

FISH. 181 

portioned fringe for it, — or Oysters (No. 183*), or cut a 
Sole in strips, crobsways, about the size of a smelt ; fry them «• di- 
rected in (No. 145;) amd lay them roand. Seod up Lobster sauce 
(No. 284) two boats of it, if it is for a Jarge party. 

N. B. Cold Turbot with (No. 372) for Sauce— or take off 
tbe Fillets that are left, as soon as the Tiirbot returns from 
Table — and they will make a side dish-for your next dinner, 
warmed in (No. 364,) (No. 2). 

Obs. — The thickest part is the favourite, and the Carver of 
this Fish roust remember to ask his friends if they are Fin- 
Fanciers, It will save a troublesome Job to the Carver, if the 
Cook, when the Fish is boiled, cuts the spine-bone across the 
middle. 

A BnM (No. 143.) 

Is dressed the same way as a Turbot. 

ISoles to Boil. (No. 144.) 

A fine fresh thick Sole, is almost as good eating as a Tur- 
bot. Wash and clean it nicely ; put it into a fish-kettle with a 
handful of salt, and as much cold water as will cover it ; set it 
on the side of the fire, t^ke off the scum as it rises, and let it 
boil gently ; — about five minutes (according to its size) will be 
long enough, unless it be very large. Send it up on a fish 
drainer garnished with slices pf Lemons and sprigs of curled 
Par8ley,or nicely fried Smelts (No. 173,) or Oysters (No.l83). 

Obs, — Slices of Lemon are a universally acceptable garnish. 
"With either fried or broiled fish ; — a few Sprigs of crisp Pari' 
ley may be added, if you wish to make it look very smart ; 
and Parsley, or Fennel and butter, are excellent sauces, see 
(No. 261,) and (No. 266,) or Chervil sauce (No. 264,) An- 
chovy (No. 270). 

N. B. Boiled Soles are very good, warmed up like Eels, 
Wiggy's way, (No. 164,) or covered with While Sauce, (No. 
364, No. 2,) and see (No. 158). 

Soles, or other Fish, to Fry. (No. 145,) 

Be sure they are quite fresh, or the most expert Cook cannot 
make them either look, or eat well. 

An hour before you intend to dress them, wash them thor- 
oughly, and wrap them in a clean cloth, to iTiake them perfect- 
ly dry,— or the Bread crumbs will not stick to them. 
16 



183 n^iu 

Prepare gome Bread Crumbs* by rubbing some stale bread 
through a Cullender ; or, if you wish the Fish to -appear very 
delicately and highly finisfi.'d, through a Ha'ir sieve. 

Beat the yoikaod white of an Egg well together, on a plate, 
with a fork ; — fiour your fish to absorb any moisture that may 
remain, and wipe it off with a clean «loth :— dip them ia the 
egg on both sides all over, or, what is better, egg them with a 
paste-brusb,— strew the Bread Crumbs all over the Fisb,3o that 
they cover every part, — take up the fish by the head, and shake 
off the Ioos« crumbs. The Fish is now ready for the Frying- 
pan. 

Put a Quart or more of fresh sweet Olive Oil, or Cfarified 
Butter (No. 259), Dripping (No. 83,) Lard,+ or Cferified 
Drippings (No. 83) ; be sure they are quite sweet and perfect- 
ly clean : (the Fat ought to cover the Fish;) what we here^r- 
der, is for Soles about ten inches )oog, — if larger, cut them io- 
to pieces «the proper size to help at table ; this will save much 
time and trouble to the Cikrver,<— «wben yon send them to table, 
lay them in the same form they were before they were cut, and 
you may strew a little corled Parsley' «ver them : they are muck 
easier managed in the Fryingpan, and refquire less Fat; and 
you can by this means only fry the thick part enough, without 
frying the thin too much. Very large Soles should be boiled 
(No. 144,) or fried in Fillets (No. 147). 

Set the fryingpan over a sharp and clear fire ; watch it, skim 
it with an Egg^ slice, and when it boils, j; i. e. when- it has done 
bubbling, and the smoke just begins to rise from the surface, 
put in the Fish : if the Fat is not e<ctremely hot, it is impossible 
to fry Fish of a good colour, or to keep them firm and crisp, 
(read the 3d Chapter of the Rudiments of Cookery). 

The best way to ascertain the heat of the Fat, is to try it with 
a bit of bread as big as a nut ; if it is quite hot enough, the 



* A large pair of Soles will take the fourth part of a quartern Loaf, 
which now costs twopence halfpenny. Oatmeal is a good substitute 
for Bread Crumbs, — and cost comparati,veIy. nothing. 

t The Fat will do Two or Three timeSy if strained through a bair 
sieve, and put by ; if yon do not find it enough, put a little fresh to 
it. Read (No. 83,) and the 3d Chapter of the Rudiments of Cookery. 

X This requires a Heat of upwards of 600 degrees of Fahrenheit's 
thermometer — ^frting is, in fact, Boiling in Fat,

bread will brown immediately. Putin the Fish, and it will be 
crisp and brown on the side next the fire, in about four or $Te 
roinuies; — to turn ft, stick a two-pronged fork near the head, 
and support the tail with a fish-slice, and fry the other side. 

Fry one Sole at a time, except tht^ pan is very large, and you 
have plenty of fat. 

When the Fish are fried, lay them on a soft cloth (old table 

cloths are best), near enough the fire to keep them warm ; turn 

them every two or three niinuteSt till th'iy are'qiute dry on both 

sides — this, common Cooks commonly neglect. It will take 

ten or fifteen minutesf, if the Fat you fried them in was not hot 

enough ; when it is, they want very little drying. When 

Soles are filled, they will keep very good in a d%*y place fir three 

or four days ; warm thernfby hanging them on the hooks in a 

HuUch oven, letting them heat very gradually, by putting it 

some distance from the fii e for about twenty minutes, or in 

good Gravy, as Eels, Wiggy's way, (Nos, 164j 9>99y "337, or 

356). ■'''^'' ''-' ' . • ' 

Obs, — There are several general rules fa' this Ri^ceipt whicli 
apply to all Fried Fish : — we have b^eo very particular and 
mioute in our directions ;— 'for, although a Fried Sole is so fre- 
quent and favourite a dish, it is very seldom brought to table in 
perfection.;}: 

Soles to Sletc. (No. 1 46.) 

These are half fried, and then done the same as Eels, Wig- 
gy's way. See (No. 164). 

Fillets of Soles, Brown, or White, (No. 147.) ^ 

Take off the Fillets very nicely — trim them neatly, and 
press them dry between a soft cloth ; Egg, Crumb, atid Fry 
them, &c. as directed in (No. 145,) or boil them, and serve 
them with (No. 364,) (No. 2). 

t If you are in haste, lay the Sole on a dean soft cloth, cover it 
with it, and gently press it upon the fish to suck up the fat from its 
surface. 

X The very indifferent manner in which the operation of frying iuh 
is usually performed, we suppose, produced the following jeu d' esprit 
which appeared in The Jifdrning Chronicle : — 

**^The King:^8 Bench Reports have cookM up a.i odd diib,

1 84 FISH. 

N. B. This is one of the best ways of dressing very large 
Soles. See also (No. 1 64.) 

fldr Scfi APPENDIX I. for Skate. 

Cod Boiled. (No. 149). 

Wash and clean the fish, and rub a little salt in the inside of 
it ; (if the weather is very cold, a large cod is Ihe better for 
being keptf a day :) put plenty of water in your fish-kettle, so 
that the fish may be well covered ; put in a large handful of 
salt: and when it is dissolved, put in your fish ; a very small 
fish will require from fifteen to twenty minutes, after the water 
boils, — large ones about half an hour ; drain it on. the fish- 
plate ; dish it with a garnish of the Roe, Liver, ChiUe^h'ngs, 
&c. ; or large native Oysters, fried a light brown, see (No. 
183*) or Smelts, (No. 173,) Whitings, (No. 153,) the taiit 
of the Cod cut ia slices,— K)r split it*— and fry it. Scolloped 
Oysters, (No* 18%) Oyster Sauce, (No. i78), 

Mem. The Sounds, — the Jelly parts about the Jowl, the 
Palate, and the Tongue, are esteemed exquisites by piscivorous 
Epicures — whose longing Eyes will keep a sharp look-out for 
a share of their favourite " Bonne Bouche ;** — the Carver's 
reputation depends much on his equitable distribution of them. 

Salt Fish Boiled. (No. 150.) 

Salted Fish requires Soafdng^ according to the time it has 
been in Salt ; — that which is hard and dry, requires two nights' 
Foaking, changing the water two or three times; the intermedi- 
ate day, lay it on a stone floor ; — for Barrelled Cod, leas time 
will do;— and for the best Dogger Bank Split B'ish, which has 
not been more than a fortnight or three weeks in salt, still less 
will be nt»edf«»l. 

Put it into plenty of cold wa».er, and let it simmer gently till 
it is enough— if the water boils, the fish will be tough and 
thready. For Ej^g sauce, see (No. 267,) and to boil Red 
Beetroot, (No. 127,) Parsnips, (No. 128,) Carrots, (No. 129). 
Garnish Salt Fish with the yolks of Eggs, cut into quarters. 



t The author of the Cook** Cookery, does not seem to think this fish ean be too 
fresh ; for he commences his directions with, ** If you can, get a Cod hot out of the 
Sea,'* &c. 

t The tail is so much thinner than the thick |Mirt of the bodv, that, if boiled to- 
l?ether, the farmer will be boiled too much— before the latter is done enoueh— there- 
fore it sbouM be dressed separate, and the best way of cookiDe it is to Ihr it in Slifees 
or Fillets ; see (No.lil.) 



PISH* 185 

06s.— Our favourite vegetable accomfitniment is a dish of 
equal parts of Red Beetroot and Parsoips. 

N. B. Salted Fish differs in quality — qmU as muc^ a» it 
does in price. 

Slices of Cod BoiUd. (No. 151.) 

Half an Hour before you dress them^ put them iDto cold 
spring water with some salt in it. 

Lay tbem at the bottom of a fish-kettle, with as much cold 
spring water as will cover them, and some salt ; set it on a 
quick fire, and when it boils, skim it, and set it on one side of 
the fire to boil very gently,for about ten roinutes,accordiag to its 
«ze and thickness. Garnish with scraped Horseradish, slices of 
Lemon, and a slice of the Liver or one side, and Chitterliog 
on the other. Oyster sauce, (No. 278,) and Plain Butter. 

06s.— Slices of Cod (especially "the Tail, split,) are very 
good, fried like Soles, (No. 145,) or stewed in Gravy tike Eels, 
(No. 164,) or (No. 364, No. 2.) 

Whitings Fried. (No. 1 53.^ 

Skin them,* preserve the liver, see No. 228, and f;?iSt6D their 
tails to their mouths; dip ihem in egg, then in bread crumbs, 
and fry them in hot lard, read (No. 145 ;)— or split ihem, and 
fry them like fillets of Soles, (No. 147.) 

A three quart stewpan, half full of fat, is the best utensil to 
fry Whitings. They will be done enough in about five min- 
utes — but it will sometimes require a quarter of an hour to 
drain the fat from them and dry them, (if the fat you put them 
into was not hot enough,) turning them now and then with a 
Fish Slice. 

065. When Whitings are scarce, the Fishmongers can 

skin and truss young Corf/mg-s,— so that you can hardly tell the 
difference, except that a Codling wears a Beard, and a Whi- 
ting does not:— this distinguishing mark is sometimes cut off; 
however, if you turn up his Jowl, you may see the mark where 
the Beard was,and thus discover whether He be a real Wiiit- 
iNO, or a Shaved Codling.

1 SG FISH. 

^aU Fried. (No. 154.) 

After you have cleaned the fish, divide it into fillets, dry 
them 00 a clean cloth ; beat the yolk and white of an egg 
thoroughly together, dip the fish in this, and then in fine bre^d 
crumbs : fry it in hot lard or drippings till it is of a delicate 
brown coloor ; lay it on a hair sieve to drain ; garnish with 
Crisp Parsley, (No. 318,) and some like Caper sauce, with an 
Anchovy in it. 

Plaice, or Flounders Fried, or Boiled. (No, 1 55.) 

Flounders are perhaps the most difficult fish to fry very 
nicely. Clean them well, flour them, and wipe them with a 
dry cloth to absorb all the water from them ; flour or egg and 
bread-crumb them, &c. as directed in (No. 145.) 

To BOIL Flounders. 

Wash and clean them well, cut the black side of them the 
same as you do Turbot, then put them into a fish-kettle, with 
plenty of cold water and a handful of salt ; when they come 
to a boil, scum them clean, and let them stand by the side of the 
fire for hve minutes, and they are ready. 

Ofts. — Eaten with plain melted butter and a little salt ; — ^you 
have the sweet delicate flavour of the Flounder— ^which is 
overpowered by any sauce. 

Water Souchy^ (No. 156.) 

Is made with Flounders, Whitings, Gudgeons, or Eels. 
These must be quite /resA, and very nicely cleaned ; for what 
they are boiled in, is the sauce for them. 

Wash, gut, and trim, your Fish,, cut them into handsome 
pieces, and put them into a stewpan with just as much water 
as will cover them, with some parsley, or parsley roots sliced, 
an onion minced fine, and a little pepper arid salt : (to this 
some Cooks add some scraped Horseradish and a Bay leaf ;)— 
skim it carefully when it boils ; when your fish is done enough 
(which it will be in a few minutes), send it up in a deep dish

Obs. Some Cooks thicken the liqcror the Fish has been stew- 
ing in with flour and batter— and flavour it with white wine» 
Lemon jaice. Essence of Anchovy, and Catsup — and boil 
down two or three FloundeFS»&c* to ji^ke a fish broth, to boil 
the other fish in — observing that the Broth cannot be goody un- 
less the Fish are boiled too much. 

Haddock Boiled (No. 157.) 

Wash it well, and put it on to boil, as directed in (No. 149 ;) 
a Haddock of three pooods will take abont ten minutes after 

the kettle boils. 

• • • ■ 

Findkorn Haddocks. (No. 157*.) 

Let the Fish be well cleaned and laid, in Salt for two hours, 
let the water drain from theco, and then wet them with 
the Pyroligneous add^ — they may be split or not — they are 
then to be hung in a dry situation fpr a day or two, or a week 
or two, if you please ; — when broiled, they have aU the flavour 
of the Findborn Haddock, and will keep eweet for a long time. 

The Pyroligneous acid, eppliecTitf the same way to Beef or 
Mutton,. gives the fine &moka flavour, and may be kept for a 
considerable length of time.

1 88 FISH. 

0&<.— These fish are rerj nice plain boiled, with (No. ^61), 
or (No. 264,) for sauce ; some Cooks dredge them with flour, 
and fry them a light brown before they put them on to stew — 
and stuff them with (No. 374,) or some of the stuffings fol- 
lowing. 

To Dress them Maiorb. 

Put the Fish into a stewpan, with a large Onion, four 
Clores, fifteen berries of Allspice, and the same of black pep- 
per — just cover tbem with boiling water, set it where they will 
simmer gently for ten or twenty minutes, according to the size 
of the Fish ; strain off the liquor in another stewpan, leaving 
the Fish to keep warm till the Sauce is ready. 

Rub together on a plate as much flour and butter as will 
make the sauce as thick as double Cream. Each Pint o/ 
Sawce^ season with a glass of Wine, half as much Mushroom 
Catsup, a teaspoonful of Essence of Anchovy, and a few grains 
of Cayenne ; let it boil a few n)inutes, put the Fish on a deep 
disb, strain the Gravy over it; garnish it with Sippets of Bread 
toasted or fried, (No. 319.) 

N. B. The FSditor has paid particular attention to the abovt 
Receipt, and also to (Iffo.* 324) — which Catholics and those 
whose Religious tenets do not aUow them to eat Meat on Mcor 
gre DaySy will find a very satisfactory substitute for the Meat 
Gravy Soup, (No. 200.) 

For Sauce for Maigre Dishes, see (Nos. 225, 305, aod 
364, No. 2.) 

Obs, — Mushroom Catsup, (No. 439,) and Onions, (No. 
402,) supply the place of Meat, better than any thing ; if yoa 
have not these. Wine, — Spice, (No. 457,) — Curry Powder, 
(No. 455,) — Aromatie Roots and Herbs, — Anchovy and Soy, 
— ^or Oyster Catsup, (No. 441,) variously combined, arid thick- 
ened with floor and butter, are convenient substitutes.

Pei'ch Btriled. (No. 160.) 

Clean them carefally, and put them io a fish-kettle, with as 
much cold spring water as will cover them, with a baodfal of 
^alt ; set them oo a quick fire till they boil ; when they boil, 
set them on one side to boil gently for about ten minutes, ao» 
cording to their size. g:|" Salt water Perch are skinned 6«- 
fore cooking. 

Salmon, Herrings, Sprat,% Mackarel, Sfc. Pickled (No. 161) 

Cut the Fish into proper pieces — do not take off the scaies 
— make a brine strong enough to bear an Egg, in which boil 
the Fish — it must he boiled in only just liquor enough to cor- 
er it — do not overboil it. When the 6sh is boiled, lay it slant- 
ingly to drain off all the liquor — when cold, pack it close in the 
kits, and fill them up with equal parts of the liquor the Salmon 
was boiled in (having first well skimmed it), and best Vinegar, 
(No. 24) ; let them rest for a day, fill ap again, striking the 
sides of the kit with a Cooper's Adze until the kit will receive 
00 more — then head them down as close aa posiible. 

0&s.^Tbis is in the finest condition wheo fresh Salmon is 
most plentiful, (about Midsummer) ; the season for it is from 
February to September. Some sprigs of /res/i gathered young 
Fennel — are the accompaniments. 

N. B. The three indispensable marks of the goodness of 
Pickled Salmon are, 1 st, The brightness of the scales, and their 
sticking fast to the skin ; 2dly, The firmness of the flesh ; and 
3dly, its fine pale red rose colour ;— without these it is not fit 
to eat, and was either stale before it was pickled, or has been 
kept too Jong after. 

The above was given us as the actual practice of those who 
pickle it for the London market. 

N.B. Pickled Salmon, vyarmed by steam, or in its pickle 
liquor, is a favourite dish at Newcastle. v 

Salmon Boiled. ' (No. 1*62.) 

Put on a fish-kettle, with spring water enough to well cover 
the Salmon you are going to dress, or the Salmon will neither 
look nor taste well: (boil the Liver in a separate saucepan.) 
When the water .. boils, put in a handful of salt, take off the 
scum as soon as it rises, have the fish well washed, put it io, 
and if it is thick, let it boil very gently about a quarter of an

Cook in dressing Salmon ; — a quarter of a split Salmon will 
take almost as long boilibg, as half a one. Lobster Sauce^ 
(No. 284.) 

06s. — The thinnest part of the Fish, is the fattest, and if 
you have a '* Grand Gourvian(r^ at table, ask him if he is for 
Thick or Thin. ^ 

The Thames Salmon is preferred in the London Market, 
and some Epicures pretend to be able to distinguish by ibe 
taate, in which reach of the river it was caught ! ! ! 

N.B. Tf you have any lefl^ put it into a pye-dish,^aDd cover 
it with an equal portion of Vinegar and Pua)p-watery aod a 
little salt, it will be ready la three days. 

Fresh Salmon Broiled. (No. 163.) 

Clean the salmon well, and cut it into slices about an iach 
and a half thick ; dry it thoroughly in a clean cloth, r«b itpytf 
with sweet oil, or thick melted butter, and sprinkle a littlesalt 
over it ; pat your gridiron over a clear fire, at some distjaac;^ i 
when it is hot, wipe it clean, rub it with sweet oil or lard ; Uy 
the salmon on, and when it is done on One side, tarn it geutl/ 
and broil the other. Anchovy sauce, &c. 

Obs. — An oven does them best. 

Soles or Ecfe+,4fc. Sfc, stewed Wiocrr's way, (No. 164,; 

Take two pounds of fine silver Eels:]: ; — the best are those 
that are rather more than a half-crown piece in circumference, 
quite fresh, full of life, and as " brisk as an Eel ;'* such as bare 
been kept out of water till they cigl Bcarce stir, are good for 
nothing. Gut them, rub them with salt till the slime is cleaoed 
from them, wash them in several ^different waters, and divide 
them into pieces about four inches long. 

Some cooks skin them, dredge them with a little fiour, snd 
wipe them dry, and then egg and crumb them, and fry them in 
drippings - till they are brown, and lay them to dry on a hair 
sieve, {[ilr See Appendix I.

only mark to know the |>est ; the right colour of the back is a Tery brirbt coppery 
hne i Ibe oUt« coloured are inferior ; and those tending to a green are worse. 



FISH* 191 

Have reafly a quart of good Beef Grayy, (No. W9) ; it 
must be cold when you put the Eels iDto it ; se^ them on a alovr 
fire to simmer very gently for about a quarter of an hour, ac* 
cording to the size of the Eels; — watch them that they ar» 
not dooe top much ; — take them carefully out of the stewpaa 
^th a fi^h slice, so as not to tear their coats, and lay them on 
a dish about two inches deep. 

Make the Sauce about as thick as cream, by mizing a Iittl» 
flour with it ; and put in also two tablespoon fuls of Port wine, 
and one of Mushroom Catsup, or 'Cavice ; stir it into the 
sauce by degrees, give it a boil, and strain it to the fish through 
a sieve. 

N. B; If Mushroom sauce, (NO0. 295, 305, or 333,) or 
White Sauce, (No. 364, No, %) be used instead of Beef gni- 
Ty, this will be one of the most relishing JWaigre dishes we 
know. 

Obs, — To kill Eels instantly^ without the horrid torture of 
cutting and skinning them alive, pierce the spinal marrow, close 
to the back part of the skull, with a sharp pointed skewer : if 
this be done in the right place, all motion will instantly cease. 
The humane Executioner does certain criminals the favour to 
hang them before he breaks them on the wheel. 

To fry Eek. (No. 165.) 

Skin and gut them, and wash them well in cold water, cut 
tbem in pieces four inches long, season them with pepper and 
salt, beat an egg well on a plate, dip them in the egg, and then 
in fine bread crumbs; fry them in fresh clean lard, drain tbem 
well from the fat ; Garc^sl;^ with crisp parsley ; for Sauce, plain 
and melted butter, sharpened with lemon juice, or Parsley and 
Butter.

Mackerel Boiled. (No. 167.) 

This Fish loses its life as soon as it leaves the Sea, and the 
fresher it is the better. 

IVash and clean them thoroughly, (the fishmongers seldom 
do this sufficiently), put them into cold water with a handful of 
salt in it ; let them rather simmer, than boil ; a small mackerel 
will be enough in about a quarter ef an hour ; when the Eye 
starts and the Tail splits, they are done ; do not let them stand 



192 . FISH* 

in the water a moment after ; they are so delicate that the beat 
of the water will break them. 

This fish ID LoodoD is rarely fresh enough to appear at ta- 
ble in perfection ; and either the Mackerd is boiled too much, 
or the Roe* too little. The best way is to open a slit opposite 
the middle of the roe, yoa can then clean it properly ; this will 
allow the water access, and the roe will then be done as so^ 
•8 the fisb, which it seldom is otherwise ; some sagacious 
gourmands insist upon it they must be taken out and boiled 
separately. For sauce, see (Nos. 363, 265, and 266,) and you 
may garnish them with pats of minced Fennel. 

N. B. The common notion is, that Mackerel are in best ca(%^ 
dition when fullest of Roe; — however, the Fish ni that time 
is only valuable for its Roe^^the Meat of it has scarcely any 
flavour. 

After they have let go their Roes, they are called shotten 
mackerel, and are not worth catching, the Roe, which was all 
that was good of them, being gone. 

li is in the early sedson, token they have least Roe, that Ike 
flesh of this Fi^ is in highest perfection. There is also an 
after-season, when a few fine large Mackerel are taken, (i,e, 
during the Herring season, about October,) which some pisciv- 
orous Epicures are very partial to, — these fish having had time 
to fatten and recover their Health, are full of high flavour, and 
their flesh is firm and juicy ; they are commonly called Silver 
Mackerel from their beautiful appearance, their colour being al- 
most as bright when boiled, aji it was the moment they were 
caught. 

Mackerel Broiled. (No. 169.) 

Cleap a fine large mackerel, wipe it on a dry cloth, and cut 
a long slit down the back ; lay it on a clean gridiron, over a 
very clear slow fire ; when it is done on one side turn it ; be 
careful ^hat it does not burn ; send it up with Fennel sauce, 
(No. 265,) mix well together a Ultle finely minced Fennel and 
Parsley seasoned with a little Pepper and Salt, a bit of fresh 
butter, and when the Mackerel are ready for the table, put some 
of this into each fish.

Mackerel Baked. (No. 170.) 

Cut off their beads, open theni, and take out the roes, and 
clean ihem thoroughly ; rub them oo the inside wuh a little 
pepper and salt, put the roes io again, season them (with a mix- 
ture of powdered allspice, black pepper and salt, well rubbed 
together,) and lay them close in a baking pan, cover them with 
equal quantities of cold vinegar and water, tie them down with 
stroog white paper doubled, and bake them for an hour in a 
elow OTen. They will keep for a fortnight. 

Sprats Brmled. (No. 170*.) 

If you have not a Sprat Gridiron, get a piece of pointed iron 
^ire as thick as packthread, and as long as your gridiron is 
broad ; run this through the heads of the sprat?, sprinkle a tit- 
tle flour and salt over them, — put your gridiron over a clear 
qeick fire, turn them in about a couple of minutes : when the 
other side is brown, draw out the wire, and send up the fish 
with melted butter in a cup. 

Obs. — That Sprats are young Herrings, is evident by their 
anatomy, in which there is no perceptible difference. They 
appear very soon after the Herrings are gone, and seem to be 
the spawn just vivified. 

Sprats Stewed. (No. 170.**) 

Wash and dry youV Sprats, and lay them as level as you 
can in a stewpan, and between every layer of sprats put three 
Peppercorns and as many allspice, with a few grains of salt; 
barely cover them with Vinegar, and stew them one hour over 
a slow fire; they must not boil ; a Bay Leaf is sometimes add- 
ed. Herrings or Mackerel may be stewed the same way. 
To Fry Sprats, see (No. 173.) 

Herrings Broiled. (No. 171.*) 

Wash them well, then dry them with a cloth, dust them with 
flour, and broil them over a slow fire till they are well done. 
Send up melted butter in a boat.

ioto salt and wftter for one hour, drain and wipe your fish, and 
put them into jars or casks, with the following preparation, 
which is enough for three dozen Mackerel. Take salt and bay 
salt, one pound each, saltpetre and tump sugar, two ounces 
each ; grind and pound the salt, &c. well together, put the fish 
into jiars or casks, with a layer of the preparation at the bottom, 
then a layer of mackerel with the skin side downwards ; so 
continue alternately till the cask or jar is full ; press it down 
and cofer it close. In about three months they will be fit for 
use. 

Red Herrings, and other Dried Fish, (No. 172.^ 

" Should be cooked in the same manner now practised by 
the poor in Scotland. They soak them in water until they be* 
come pretty fresh ; they are then hung up in the Sun and 
Wind, on a stick, through their Eyes, to dry ; and then boiled 
or broiled. In this way, they eat almost as weU as if they 
were new caught.^' 

'* Scotch Haddocks should be soaked allii^bt. Yoa may 
boil or broil them ; if you broil, split tbem in two. 

'' All the different sorts of Dried Pish, except Stock With^^^ 
are salted, dried in the Sun, in prepared kilns, or by the smob 
of wood fires ; and require to be softened and freshened, in 
proportion to their bulk, nature, or dryness ; the veiy dry sort, 
as CW, Whitings Sfc, should be steeped in Inkewafm water, 
kept as near as possible to an equal degree of Heat The 
larger fish should be steeped twelve hours ; the smaller about 
two ; after which they should be taken out and hung up by the 
tails until they are dressed. The reason for hanging them up 
is, that they soften equally as in the steeping, without extract- 
ing too much of the relish, which would render them insipid. 
When thus prepared, the small F««^, as Whiting, Tusk, &c. 
should be floured and laid on the gridiron ; and when a little 
hardened on one side, must be turned and basted with sweet 
oil upon a feather ; and when basted on both sides, and well 
heated through, taken up. A clear charcoal fire is the best for 
cooking them, and the Fish should be kept at a good di^aaee, 
to broil gradually. "When they are enough they will swell a 
little in the basting, and you must not let them fall again. If 
boiledy as the larger fish generally are, they should be kept just 
simmering over an equal fire ; in which way half an hour will 
do the largest fish, and ^^e minutes the smallest.

Fisti* 195 

" DHed Salmon, tbougb a large F»k, does npt tequire more 
steeping than a Whiting ; and when laid oir the |ndiron should 
be moderately peppered. To Herring and to all kinds of 
broiled Soli Fish, sweet oil is the best basting." 

The above is from Macdonald's London Family Cock. 

SmeltSy Sprats J or other smaU Fish Fried, (No. 173.) 
Clean and dry them thoroughly in a cloth, fry them plain, or 
laeat an egg on a plate, dip them in it, and then in fine bread 
crumbs that have been nibbed through a siere ; fry them in 
plenty of elean iafd, or drippings ; as soon as the lard boils and 
is still, put in the fiehj-^as soon as they are delicately browned, 
they are done ; tbie will hardly take two minutes. Drain them 
on a hair sieve, placed before the fire^ twiriDg them till quite 
dry. 

O&s.— Read (No. 145.) 

PoUed Prawns^ Shrimps^ or Cray^Jish. (No. 17d.) 

Boil them in water, with plenty of Salt in it. When you 
have picked them, powder them with a little beaten mace, or 
grated nutmeg, or allspice, and pepper and salt ; add a little 
cold butter, and pound all well together in a marble mortar till 
of the consistence of paste. Put it into pots covered with 
clarified butter, and cover them over with wetted bladder. 

Lobster. (No. 176.) 

Buy these Alive, — the Lobster-Merchants sometimes keep 
tbem till they are starved, before tliey boil them ; they are then 
watery, and*tave not baU their flavour. 

Choose those that (as an old Cook says, are '* Heavy and 
Livehj^^ and) are full of motion, which is the index of their 
freshness. 

Those of the middle size are the best. J\'*ever take them 
when the Shell is incrusted, which is a sign they are old. The 
Male Lobster is preferred to Eat, and the Female (on account 
of the Eggs) to make Sauce of. The Hen Lobster is distin- 
guisbed, by having a broader Tail than the Male, and less 
claws. 

Set on a pot^ with water salted in the proportion of a table- 
spoonful of salt to a quart of water ; — when the water boils put 
it in, and keep it boiling briskly from half an hour to an hour, 
according to its size ; wipe all the scum off it, and rub the shell 
with a very little butter or sweet oil ; break off the great claws^

*^* These Fish come in about Aprils and continue plentifiil 
till the Oyster season returns* ; after that time they begin to 
spawn, and seldom open solid. 

Crab. (No. 177.) 

The abore obaenrations apply to Crabs, which should neither 
be too small nor too large. The best size are those which 
tneasare about eight inches across the shoulders.

the same time as Lobstere. The Cromer Crabs are most es- 
:teemedf but numbers are brought from the Ide of Wights 

Potted Lobster or Crab. (No. 17S.) 

This must be made with fine Hen Lobsters when full of 
spawn, boil them thoroughly, see (No. 176); when cold, pick 
out all the solid meat, and pound it in a mortar, it is usual to 
add by degrees (a ?ery little) finely pounded mace, black or 
Cayenne pepper, salt, and, while pounding, a little butter. 
When the whole is well mixed, and beat to the consistence of 
paste, press it down hard in a preserving-pot, pour clarified 
butter over it, and cover it with wetted bladder. 

Obs, — Some pot Lobster without pounding it, and only cut 
h or pull it iftto such pieces as if it was prepared for sauce, and 
mince it with the spawn and soft parts and seasoning, and press 
it together as close as possible ; in packing it, place the coral 
and spa^vn, &c. in layers, so that it may look regular and hand- 
some when cut out. If you intend it as store, see N. B. to 
(No. 284) to make Sauce with, this is the best way to do it — 
but if for Sandwiches, &;c. the first is the best, and will keep 
much longer.

OYSTERS^. (No. 181.) 

The cominoQ+ Colchester and Feversham oyslere are brought 
to market oo the 5tb of August ; — the Miltou or as they are 
commonly called, the melting Native8,X do not come in tiU the 
beginniag of October, cootioue in season till the l^th of May, 
and approach the meridian of their perfection about Christmas. 

Some piscivorous Gourmands think that Oysters are not best 
when quite fresh from their beds, and that their flavour is too 
brackish and harsh, and is much ameliorated by giving them -a 
feed. 

To Fbbd§ Oysters. Cover them with clean water, with a 
pint of salt to about two gallons ; (nothing else, no oatmeal, 
f\our, nor any other trumpery) ; this will cleanse them from 
the mud and sand, &c. of the bed ; after they have lain in it 
twelve hours, change it for fresh salt and water, and in twelve 
hours more they will be in prime order for the Moutb, and re- 
main so two or three days: — at the time of high water you 
may see them open their shells, in expectation of receiving their 
usual food. Tliis process of feeding oysters, is only employ- 
ed when a great many come up together. The real Colches- 
ter, or Pyfleet barrelled oysters.that are packed at the beds, are 
better without being put in water ; they are carefully and tight- 
ly packed, and fnust not be disturbed till wanted for table : 
these, in moderate weather, will keep good for a week, or ten 
days. 

If an Oyster opens his mouth in the barrel, he dies immedi- 
ately. 

To preserve the lives of Barrelled Oysters^ put a heavy 
weig;ht on the wooden top of the barrel, which is to be placed 
on (be surface of the oysters. This is to be effected by re- 
moving the first hoop, the staves will then spread and stand

Ohs. — ComnooD people are lodifFerent about ike manner of 
opening OysterBf aod the time of eating them after they are 
opened ; nothing, however, is more important, ia the enlight- 
ened eyes of the experienced Oyster eater. 

Those who wish to enjoy this delicious restorative in its ut- 
most perfection, must eois U the momevt it is opened^ with ]t» 
own gravy in the under shell : — if not Eaten while Absoluielif 
Alive, its flavour and spirit is lost. 

The true lover of an Oyster, will have some regard for the 
feelings of his little favourite, and will never abandon it to the 
mercy of a bungling operator, — but will open it himself, and 
contrive to detach the Fish from the shell so dexterously, that 
the Oyster is hardly conscious he has been ejected from his 
Lodging, till he feels the Teeth of the piscivorous Gourmand. 
tickling him to Death. 

N. B. Fitb is lest nutritioui than Flesh : as a proof, whco the 
trainer of Newmarket wishes to watte a Jockey, he is not allowed 
Meat, nor even Pudding-, if Fish can be had. The white kinds of 
Fish, Turbots, Soles, Whiting, Cod, Haddock, Flounders, Smelts, Sic. 
are less nutritious than theoib^ U^ Fish, such as -Eels, "Salmon, Her* 
rings. Sprats, &c. ; the latter, however, are more difficult to digest^ 
and often disturb weak stomachs, so that they are obliged to call in- 
the assistance of Caytnne^ CogniaCy he. 

Shell Fish, have long held a high rank in the catalogue of easily 
digestible and speedily restorative foods ; of these, the Oyster cer- 
tainly deserves the best character, — but, we think it has acquired not 
& little more reputation for these qualities than it deserves ; a well' 
dressed Chopt or Steak, see (No. 94,) will invigorate the Heart in a 
much higher ratio ; and to recruit tht Jinimal Spiritt and tupport 
ttrengUif there is nothing eqnal to Animal food, — when kept till prop* 
erly tender^ none will give so little trouble to the Digestive organs, 
and so much substantial excitement to the Constitution. See note 
under (No. 186*.) 

We could easily say as much in praise of Mutton, as Mr. Ritson 
has against it, in his ** Essay on Mstinenet from Mun&l Food as a 

t Animal food, being composed of themast: natritioni parts of the 
food on which the animal lived, and haying already been digested by

Scolloped Oysters. (No. 182.) 

A good way to warm op any cold Fish. 

< Stfiw tlie OyMcra slowly io their owd liquor for two or three 
minutes, — take them out with a spoon, and beard them and 
skim the liquor, — put a bit of butter into a Btewpan,-~and 
when it is melted, add as much fine bread crumbs as will dry 
it up, then put to it the Oyster liquor, and give it a boil up,-— 
put the Oysters into Scollop shells that you have buttered, and 
stewed with bread crombe, — then a layer of Oysters, — ^then of 
bread crumbs, and then some more Oysters, — moisten it with 
the Oyster liquor, cover them with bread crumbs, — put about 
half a dossen little bits of butter on the top of each, and brown

on Peel,. Mace, and other Spices, Ssc, are added by those who 
prefer fiqwmce to the genuine fla? our of the Oyster. 

Colo FrsH may be re-dressed in the same way. 

N. B. Small Scollop shells, or Saucers that bold about hall 
a dozen Oysters are the most convenient. 

Steioed Oysters. (No. 18^.*) 

Large Oysters will do for stewing, and by some are prefer- 
red ; but we love the plump, juicy natives. Stew a couple of 
dozen of these in their own liquor ^ — when they are coming 
to a boil, skim well,, take them up and beard them ; strain 
the liquor through a tammis sieve, and lay the oysters on a

BROTHS, GRAVIES, AND SOUPS. 

Beef Broth*. (No. 185.) 

Wash a Leg or Shin of Beef very clean, crack the bone in 
two or three (iilaces, (this you should desire the but«her to do 
for you,) add thereto any trimmiogf you have of Meat, Game, 
or Poultry, (i, e, heads, necks, gizzards, feet, &c.) and cover 
thenn with cold water,^-watch and stir it up well from the bot- 
tom, and the moment it begins to simmer, sfo'm it carefully-^ 
your Broth must be perfectly clear and limpid ; — on this, de^ 
pends the goodness of the Soups, Sauces, and Gravies, of which 
it is the Basis ; then add some cold water to make the remain- 
ing scum rise, and skim it again ; — when the scum has done 
rising, and the surface of the broth is quite clear, put in on& 
mod[erate-sized Carrot, a head of Celery, two Turnips, 
and two Onions, — ^it should not have any taste of sweet herbs» 
spice, or garlic, &c. — ^eitber of tliene flavours can be easily im* 
mediately added after, if desired, by (Nos. 420, 421, 402,)&c» 
— cover it close, — set it by the side of the fire, — and let it sim- 
mer very gently (so as not to waste the Brbth) for four or five 
boors, or more, according to the weight of the Meat : — strain 
it through a sieve into a clean and dry stone pan, iind set it in 
the coldest place you have. 

O&s. — This is the foundation of all sorts of Soups and 
Sauces, brown or white. 

Stew no longer than the meat is thoroughly done to eat^ 
and you will obtain excellent Broth, without depriving the 
Meal of its nutritious succulence : — to boil it to rags, as is the 
common practice, will not enrich your Broths, but make them 
thick and grouty.

save the ingredients from burning ; then turn it all about, and 
let it brown slightly and equally all over; — then put in three 
quarts of boiling water]; ; when it boils up, skim it carefully, 
and wipe off with a clean doth what sticks round the edge and 
inside of the steWpan, that your gravy may be delicately clean 
and clear. Set it by the side of a fire, where it will stew gent- 
ly (to keep it clear, and that it may not be reduced too much)

best not to take off till you are ready to strain it through a

Take care it is neither too pale nor too dark a colour ; if it 
is not Thick enough^ let it stew longer, till it is reduced to the 
desired thickness ; or add a bit of glaze or Portable Soup to it, 
see (No.' 952) : if it is too TAicA;,you can thin it with a spoon-

About three pounds of the nut of the Leg of Veal, cut into 
half pound slices, with a quarter of a pound of Ham in small 
dice ; proceed as directed for the Beef Gravy (No. 186,) but 
watch the time of putting in the water ; if this is poured in too

MCnudde of Vbal, or Shin or Leg of Beef, Soup. (No. 103.) 

A Knuckle of Veal, of six pounds weight, will make a large 
tureen of excellent Soup, and is thus easily prepared : — Cut 
half a pound of Bacon into slices about half an inch thick, lay 
it at the bottom of a soup kettle, or deep stewpan, and oq (bis 
place the knuckle of veaV, having first chopped the bone in two 
or three places,—- furnish it with two carrots, two turnips, a 
head of celery, two large onions, with two or three cloves stuck 
in one of them, a dozen of corns of Black, and the samo of 
Jamaica pepper,and a good bundle of lemon thyme, winter sa- 
voury, and parsley; — Just cover the meat with cold water, and 
set it over a quick fire till is boils ; having skimmed it well, 
remove your soup kettle to the side of the fire, let it stew very 
gently till it is quite tender, i. e. about four hours ; then take 
out the bacon and veal, strain the soup, and set it by in a cool 
place till you want it, when you must take off the fat from (be 
surface of your liquor, and decant it (keeping back the settlings 
at the bottom) into a clean pan. 

If you like a Thickened Soup, put three tablespoonsfu) of 
the fat you have taken off the soup, into a small stewpan, and 
mix it with four tablespoonsfu 1 of flour, pour a ladleful of soup 
to it, and mix it with the rest by degrees, and boil it up till it is 
amooth. 

Cut the Meat and Gristle of the Ko\ickIe and the Bacon

Mutton Broth. (No. 194.) 

Take two pounds of Scrag of Mutton ; to take ibe blood out» 
put it into a Slewpan, and cover it with cold water ; wben the 
water becomes xQilk-warm, pour it off, skim it well, then put it 
in again, with four or five pints of water, a teaspoonful of salt, 
a tablespoonful of best grits, and an Onion ; set it on a slow 
fire, and when yon have taken all the scum off, put in two or 
three turnips, let it simmer very slowly for two hours, and strain 
it through a clean sieve. 

This usual method of making Mutton Broth with the Scrags 
is by no means the most Economical method of obtaining it ; 
for which see (Nos. 490 and 564.) 

Obs. — ^Yoii may thicken Broth, by boiling with it a little 
Oatmeal, Rice, Scotch or Pearl Barley ; when you make it

will make a pint and a half of strong Jelly, which is frequently 
used to make Calves* feet Jelly (No. 481,) or to add to Mock 
Turtle, and other Soups. See (No. 340*). This Jelly evap- 
orated as directed in (No. 352,) will give about three oonces 
and a half of strong tilaze, — an unboiled Heel costs one shil-

lay them on the meat, take off the outer skin of two laige 
Onions, and two Turnips, wash, dean and cut into pieces a 
couple of large Carrots, and two heads of Celery; and put in 
three Cloves and a large blade of Mace:— cover ibestewpan

s(ick to the bottom of the stewpan, turn it, and when there is a 
nice brown glaze at the bottom of the stewpan, cover the meat 
with hot water: — watch it, and when it is coming to a boil, 
put in half a pint of cold water, take off the scum, then put in 
half a pint more cold water, and skim it aig;ain, and continue to 
do so till no more scum rises. — Now set it on one side of the 
fire, to boil gently for about four hours, — strain it through a 
clean iammis, or napkin, (do not squeeze it, or the Soup will 
be thick,) into a clean Stone pan, let it remain till it is cold, 
and then remove all the Fat; — when you decant it, be careful 
^ot to disturb the settlings at the bottbm of the pan. 

The Broth should he of a fine Amber colour^ and as dear as 
Rock WaJter ; — if it is not so bright as you wish it, put it into 
a stewpan, — break two whites and shells of Eggs into a basin, 
beat them well together, put them into the Soup, set it on a 
quick fire, and stir it with a whisk till it boils, — then set it on 
one side of the fire, to setde for ten minutes, run it through a

Pease Soup. (No. 218.) 

Tbe common way of making Pease Soup § is, — to a Quart 
of Split Pease put three quarts of cold soft water, not more, (or 
it will be what " jack ros-bif'' calb ** Soup Maigre^^) not- 
withstaodiog Mother Glaese orders a gallon, (and her Lady- 
ship*B (firections have been copied by almoat every Cookery 
book-maker, whe has strung Receipts together since), with half 
a pound of Bacon, (not very fat)/or Roast beef bones, or four 
Anchovies ; or, instead of tbe water, three quarts of tbe Liquor 
in which Beef^ Mutton, Pork or Poultry has been boiled, tast- 
ing it first, to make sure it is not too saltf. 

Wash two heads of Celery:};, cut it; and put it in, with two

t If the Liquor is very saltf the pease will never boil tender. Therefore, when 
you make Pease Soup with the liquor in vhieh tattedlPoTk or Beef has been boiled, 
tie up the peasct in a cloth, and boil theni first fbr an hoar in soft waier.

the Soup-pot), till tbe Pease are tender, which will be in about 
three hours ; — ^some Cooks slice a head of Celery, alod half an

into tbe Soup, till they are lightly browned, then work the whole 
through a coarse hair sieve, and then through a fine siete, or 
(what is better) through a tammis, with the back of a woodea 
spoon; — put it into a clean etewpan, with half a teaspoonful of 
ground Black Pepperf, let it boil iagain for ten minutes, and. if 
any fat arises, skim it off. 

Send up on a plate. Toasted Bread cut into little pieces a 
quarter of an inch square,' or cut a slice of bread (that has been 
baked two days) into dice not more than half an inch square ;

the bread, and fried till it is crisp, or some httle lumps of boiled

is to save the bones of a joint of Roast beef, and put them into 
the liquor in which Mutton, or Beef, or Poik or Poultry has 
been boiled, and proceed as in the above receipt. A hock, or

If you wish to m\ke Soup the same day tou Boil Meat 
OR Poultry, prepare the pease the same as for Pease Pudding 
(No. 555,) (to which you may add an onion and a head of 
celery), when you rub the pease through the sieve, instead of 
pu tting Eggs and Butter, add some of the liquor from the pot 
to make it a proper thickness, put it on to boil for five minutes, 
an d it is ready. 

Obs, — This is hyfar the easiest, ayid the best way of making 
Pease Soup. 

Pease Soup may be mctde savoury and agreeable to the pal- 
ate, without any Meat, by incorporating two ounces of fresh 
and nicely clarified Beef, Mutton^- or Pork drippings, see (No. 
83,) with two ounces of Oatmeal, and mixing this well into 
the gallon of soup, made as above directed, see also (No. 22Q.) 

• Pease Soup and Pickled Pork, (No, 220.) 

A couple of pounds of the belly part of Pickled Pork will 
make very good broth for Pease Soup, if the pork be not too 
salt — if it has been in salt more than two days, it must be laid 
i D water the night before it is used. 

Put on the ingr^didbts mentioned io (No. 218,') in (hfe^ 
quarts of water ; boil gently for two hours, then put in the 
pork, and boil very gently till it is enough to e.at — ;this will ta^e 
about an hour and a half or two hours longer, according to its 
thickness : when done, wash the pork clean in hot water, send 
it up in a dish, or cut it into mouthfuls, and put it into the Soup 
in the tureen, with the accompaniments ordered in (No. 218). 

Obs, — The meat being boiled no longer than to be done 
«iiOtigh to be eaten, you get excellent Soup, imlhout any ex-

must be a pint of heads to thicken it, and half a pint cut in —

is sometimes made by adding the Asparagus haads tO common 
Pease soup. 

Obs. — Some Cooks fry half an ounce of Onion in a little

ingredients — the haut-gout of the Onion will entirely overcome 
the delicate flavour of the Asparagus^ and we protest against 
all such combinations.

Cheap Soups. (No.^i90 

Among the variety of schemes that have been suggested for better- 
ing the condition of the Poor^ a more useful or extensive Charity ean- 
not be devised, than that of instructing them in Economical Cookery : 
— it is one of the most important objects to which the attention of 
any real well-wisher to the public interest can possibly be directed. 

The best and cheapest method of making a nourishing Soup — is 
least known to those who have most need of it ;— it will enable those 
who have small incomes and large families — to make the most of the 
little they possess, without pinching their children of that wholesome 
nouiishment which is necessary, for the purpose of rearing them up 
to maturity in Health and Strength. 

The labouring classes seldom purchase what are called the coarser 
pieces of meat, because they do not know how to dress them, but lay 
out their money in pieces for Roasting, he. of which the bones, &c. 
enhance the price of the actual meat to nearly a shilling per pound, 
and the diminution of weight by Roasting amounts to 32 per cent. 
This, for the sake of saving time, trouble, and fire, is generally sent 
to an oven to be baked, the nourishing parts are evaporated and dried 
up, its weight is diminished nearly one-third, and all that a poor 
man can afford to purchase with his week's earnings, perhaps does 
not half satisfy the appetites of himself and family for a couple of 
days. 

. If a hard-working man cannot get a comfortable meal at Home, — 
he soon finds the way to thq Public-house, — the poor woman contents 
herself wjth Tea and Bread and Butter,— and the Children are half 
starved.

SBusliels of best Split Pease. 
1 Bushel of Flour. 



12 Bundles of Leeks. 
6 Bundles of Celery. 
121bs. of Salt. 
1 libs, of Black Pepper. 



These good ingredients will make 1000 quarts of nourishing and 
agreeable Soup, at an expense (Establishment avoided) of little less 
than 2^d. per quart. 

Of this, 2600 quarts a day have been delivered during the late in-

and not a particle appear on the surface to offend the moit delicate 
stomach,) now add the Barley Broth, at first a spoonful at a time, theo 
the rest by degrees, stirring it well together till it boils. — ^To season 
it, put a drachm of finely pounded Celery, •r Cress Seed, (or half a. 
drachm of each,) and a quarter of drachm of finely pounded Cay- 
enne (No. 404,) or a drachm and half of ground Black Pepper, or 
Allspice, into a teacup, and mix it up with a little of the soap, and 
then pour it into the rest, stir it thoioughly together, let it simmor 
gently a quarter of an hour loi^r, season it with salt, and it is ready. 

The flavour may be varied by doubling the portion of Onions, or 
adding a clove of Garlic or £8challot, and leaving out the Celery 
Seed, see (No. 672.) 

This preparation, excellent as it is, would, without variety, soon be-

Change of Food is lAisolutely necessary — ^not only as a matter of 
pleasure and comfort, but also of Health^- rou/ouri Perdrix is a 
true proverb. 

It will be much improved, if, instead of water, it be made with the 
liquor Meat has been boiled in ;-— at Tripe, Cow-heel, and Cook

with no more fuel than is necessary to warm a room — ^those who have 
not tasted it, cannot imagine what a Savoury and Satisfying Meal Is 
produced by the combination of these cheap and homely Ingredients.

ble foods afford nourishment in proportion to the quantity of Oil, 
Jelly, and IVIucillage that can be extracted from them, this Soup has 
strong claims to the attention of Rational Economists.

with cold water enough to cover it, and a quart over, set it on a 
quick fire to get the scum up, which remove as it rises ; then 
put in two carrots, two turnips, two leeks, or two large onions, 
two heads of celery, two or three cloves, and a faggot of pars* 
ley and sweet herbs ; set the pot by the side of the fire to sim- 
mer very gently, till the meat is just tender enough to eat ; 
this will require about four or five hours.

two of celery, into the soup whole, — take them out as soon as

take it out carefully, — to dish it up, see (No. 204, or 403,) 
strain the Soup through a bair sieve into a clean stewpan, take 
off the Fat, and put the Vegetables that are cut into tbe Soup, 
the flayour of which you may heighten, by adding a table- 
spoonful of of mushroom catsup. 

If a Thickened Soup is preferred, take four large table- 
spoonfuls of the clear Fat from the top of the pot, and four 
spoonfuls of Flour ; mix it smooth together, tbevi by degrees

at least, — -skim it well and pass it through a tammis, or fine

Ox'Head Soup, (No. 239.) 

Should be prepared the day before it is to be eaten, as you 
cannot cut the meat off the head into neat mouthfuls unless it is 
cold ; — therefore, the day before you want this Soup, put half 
an Ox Cheek into a tub of cold water to soak for a couple of 
hours, then break the bones that have not been broken at the 
butcher's, and wash it very well in warm water; put it into a 
pot, and cover it with cold water ; when it boils, skim it very 
clean, and then put in one head of celery, a couple of carrots, a 
turnip, two large onions, two dozen berries of black pepper, 
same of allspice, and a bundle of sweet herbs, such as marjo- 
ram, lemon-thyme, savory, and a handful of parsley ; cover the 
soup-pot close, and set it on a slow fire; take off the scum, 
which will rise when it is coming to a boil, and set it by the 
fire-side to stew very gently for about three hours ; take out the 
head, lay it on a dish, pour the soup through a fine sieve into a 
stoneware pan, and set it and the head by in a cool place till 
the next day ; — then, out the meat into neat mouthfuls, skim 
and strain off the Broth, — put two quarts of it and the Meat 
into a clean stew-pan, — let it simmer very gently for half an 
hour longer, and it is ready. If you wish it thickened, (which 
we do not recommend, — for the reasons given in the 7th Chap-

to boil gently for a quarter of an hour ; then, for fear the meat 
should catch, take off the cover, and watch it ; and when it 
has got a good brown colour, fill up the stewpan with boiling 
water, and let it simmer very gently for two hours ; — if you 
wish to have the full benefit of the meat, only stew it till it is 
just tender, cut it into mouthfals, and put it into the soup. To 
Thickien it, pour to two or three tablespoonsful of Flour, a

half a pint of Wine, (this should be Madeira, or if you wish 
to darken the color of your soup. Claret,) a teaspoonful of 
Curry Powder (No. 455,) or a quarter of a drachm of Cay- 
enne, and the peel of a Lemon pared as thin as possible ; let 
it simmer five minutes more, take out the Lemon Peel, and 
the Soap is ready for the Tureen. 

While the Soup is doing, prepare for each tureen, a dozen 
and a half of Mock Turtle forcemeat balls, (to make these, 
see (No. 375 or 376, No. 390 to No. 396,) we prefer the 
stuffing ordered in (No. 61.) and a dozen Egg balls ; and put 
them into the tureen. Brain Balls, or cakes, are a very ele- 
gant addition, and are made by boiling the brains for ten- tnin- 
utes, then putting them in cold water, and cutting them into 
pieces about as big as a large nutmeg ; take Savory, or Lem- 
on-thyme dried and finely powdered, nutmeg grated, and pep-

' much done or it will break) cut into pieces the same size as you 
cut the calfs bead, and put in the soup, just to get warm belare 
it goes to table, is a superb Bonne Bouche ; and Pickled 
Tongue, stewed till very tender, and cut into mouthful s, is a 
favourite addition with some cooks. We order the meat to be 
cut into mouthfuls, that it may be eaten with a spoon ; the 
Knife and Fork have no business in a Soup plate.

Turtlei- Soup. (No. 250.; 

The following receipt. for dressing this savoury farrago is (he 
present practice of an experienced French cook, (lately ooe of 
les homines de Bouche at Carlton- House,) and a consammate 
master of the art : I give it in his own words : — 

" The best size for taste, is from 60 to 80 pounds ; this will 
make six or eight tureens of fine soup. Kill the turtle the eve- 
ning before you wish to dress it ; tie a cord to the hind fiosof 

• Mullaga' Tawny — sig^nifies Pepper Water. The prog^ress of inex- 
perienced peripatetic PalaticiaQS has lately been arrested by this out- 
landish word being pasted on the windows of our Coffee-Houses : it 
has, we believe, answered the Restauraieurs* purpose, and often exci- 
ted John Boll to walk in and taste ; — the more familiar oame of 
Curry Soup would, perhaps, not have had sufficient of the charms of 
novelty — to seducfe him from iiis much-loved Mock Turtle. 

It is a fashionable Soup, and a g^reat favourite with our East Indian 
friends, and we give the best receipt we could procure for it. 

t The usual allowance at a Turtxs Feast, is Six Pounds live 
weight per Head .—at the Spanish Dinner, 1808, 400 Guests attend- 
ed, and 2500 pounds of Turtle were consumed. 

The Epicure Quin used to say, it was " not safe, to sit down to a 
Turtle Feast at one of the City Halls, without a basket-hiUed Knifi 
and Fork." 

We recommend our friends, before encountering such a temptationi 
to read our Peptk Precepts. Nothing is more difficult of di^' 
tion, or oflener requires the aid of Peristaltic PersuaUerSj (see paj^c 
34 of this work,) than the glatmous Callipash which is considered the . 
bonne bouche of this Soap.

the turtle, and hang it up with the head downwards ; tie the 
fore fins by way. of pintODiog them, it would oiheTwise beat «t- 
v^ self, and be troubiesome to the ezeeutioner ; take the head 
vrith your left hand, and with a sharp knife cnioff the neck as 
Bear the head as possible ; there is a joint where the koife will 
pop through without any force. Have one or two large tubs 
of water ready, and when you dissect your turtle, put it on a 
block on the back shell, slip your knife between the calliopee 
and the calliopash ; I mean between the breast and the edge of 
the back shell : when the knife has been round, and the breast 
is detached Crooi the back shell, pass your fingers underneath, 
and with your knife detach the breast from the fins, always 
keeping the edge of your knife on the side of the breast, other- 
wise it may happen you may break the gall, which is yery 
large, and if broken, your turtle is spoiled. Cut the breast into 
four pieces, next take away the guts, beginning by the liver, 
and cut away the gall, to be out of danger at once. The guts 
are to be thrown away. I have seen some cooks have them 
cleaned and cut in pieces, and put into the soup, but generally, 
they are left on the gentlemen's plates : a basin of turtle is con- 
sidered a treat, consequently it should be so dressed that none 
be left on the plate or bssin^ When your turtle is emptied, 
throw the heart, liver, kidneys, and lights into water, cut away 
the fins to the root, I mean as near to the back shell as possi* 
ble, next eui the fins in the second joint, that the white meat 
may be separated from the greeu : scrape the fat that sticks 
against the back shell, or calliopash, take it like as if you was 
skimming any thing, and put it aside. Cut the calliopash into 
four pieces. Set a large turbot pan on the fire, and when it 
boils dip a fin into it for a minute, then take it out and peel it 
very clean ; when that it done, take another, and so on till all 
are done ; then the head, next the shell and breast, piece by 
piece. Be careful to have the peel and shell entirely cleaned 
ofi^, then put in the same pan some clean water, with the breast 
and back, the four fins, and the head ; let it boil till the bones 
will leave the meat ; put with it a large faggot of turtle herbs 
as big as your two fists, four bay-leaves, and some thyme. If 
you mean to make two dishes of the fins, you must take them 
away when they have been boiled one hour.

clote^ and let it boil gently for tb«ee hours. Clean tbe bones, 
and breaat, and back, from the green fat, and cut it into pieces 
an inch long, and half an inch wide ; do not lose any, as tbe 
little biu are as good as the large ones ; besides, it would be 
very difficult to cut it all tbe same size. Put all these pieces 
on a dish in your Jarder till your broth is ready. To make 
your brothy put on a large stock-pot, and line tbe bottom of it 
with a pound and a half of lean ham, cut into slices. Cut into 
pieces a leg of real of sixteen or twenty pounds weight, except 
a pound of the fillet that you save for tbe forcemeat, put the 
rest upon the ham, with all the white meat of tbe turtle, and a 
couple of old fowls ; put it on a smart fire, with two ladJesfol 
of broth or contommS ; let it reduce to a glase ; when it be* 
gins to stick to the bottom, pour tbe liquor in which the turtle 
has been boiled into the pot where the other part of the turtle 
has been boiled, add to it a little more sweet herbs, twenty-four 
grains of allspice, six blades of mace, two large onions,, four 
carrots, half an ounce of whole pepper, and some salt, let it 
simmer for four hours, and then strain the broth thrc-o^ % 
cloth sieve. 

** Put the green part of the turtle that has been cut in pieoes, 
and nicely cleaned, with two bottles of Madeira in tbe same : 
when it has boiled a few minutes with your turtle, add to it the 
broth, then put in a stewpan half a pound of butter ; when it is 
melted, add to it four woodenspoonsful of flour, stir it on the 
fire till the flour is a fine brown colour, then pour some of your 
broth with it, mix it well, and strain it in your soup through a 
hair sieve.: cut your liver, lights, heart, kidneys, and fat into 
small square pieces, and put them into your soup, with half a 
teaspoonful of Cayenne, two of curry powder, and four tabls- 
spoonsfol of essence of anchovies; let it boil for an hour aod a 
half, carefully skimming off tbe fat.

you wish, put it lato a Bainmarie Stewpao, or a Af iUr-doifer, 
(these are made by Llotd, TiomaOy oear Norfolk-Sueet, 
Strand,) till it is evaporated to the coosisteace you wish — or, 
set the Pots ia a cool Oven, or ia a Cbeeae Toaster, at a con* 
siderable distance from the fire ; this is the only safe way of re- 
ducing it very much, without the risk of its burning, and ac- 
quiring an extremely disagreeable acrid flavour, &e. 

Obs. — ^Tbe uses of this concentrated Euence of Mtai are 
numerous. It is equally economical and convenient for mak- 
ing eorteinpore the Broths enumerated in the 06«. lo (No. 900.) 
Sauces and Gravies for Hashed or Stewed Meat, Game or 
Poultry, &C. 

You may thicken it and flavour it as directed in (No. 399 ;) 
— to make GrotTy, Sauces, &c. take double the quantity order- 
ed for Broth, 

If you have time and opportunity, as there is no reasoning io 
the Soup, either of Roots, Herbs, or Spice, boil an Onion with 
or without a bit of Parsley, and Sweet Herbs, and a few corns 
of Allspice, or other Spice, in the water you melt the Soup in, 
which may be flavoured with Mushroom Catsup (No. 439,)^- 
or Eshallot, Wine (No. 402,)— Essence of Sweet Herbs (No. 
417,) — Savoury Spice (Noh. 421, or 467,) — Essence of Cele^ 
ry (No. 409,) &c. or Zest (No. S55;) — these may be com- 
bined in the proportions most agreeable to the palate of the 
Eater — and are as portable as Portable Soup, for a very small 
portion will flavour a Pint. 

The Editor adds nothing to the solution of this Soup, but a 
very little ground Black Pepper and some Salt. 

N, B. If you are a carefal manag^er, you need not always purchase 
Meat on purpose to make this, — when you dress a large Dinner, you 
can make Glaze at very small cost, by taking care of the trimmiogs 
and parings of the meat, game, and poultry yon use i wash them well, 
put Uiem into a Stewpan, cover them with the liquor you have boiled 
Meat in, and proceed as in the above Receipt ; and see Obs. on (No.

Meh. This Portable Soup is a' most convenient article in Cooke- 
ry—especially in Small Families, where it will save a great deal of 
time and trouble. It -is also Economical^ for no more will be melted 
than is wanted-— so there is no waste.

to that obtained from a Sliin of Beef. 

jS Sheep*t Head, costing 9d. produced tliree ounces and a half. 

Two pound* of lean Meai, from the Blade Bone of Beef, produced 
hardi/ ao ounce. 

The addition of an ounce of Oum jSrabiCf and two ounces of /itn^ 
glastf to four ounces of the extract from a Leg of Beef, considerably 
diminished the consistence of the mass, without adding to its bulk. 

It has been thought that the Portable Soup which is manufactured 
for sale — is partly made with Ox Heeli ; but the experiment (No. 
198,) proves this cannot be, as an ounce of the Jelly from Ox Heel 
costs 6d. For the eheapett method of procuring a hard Jelly, see N. 
B. to (No. 481) ; — 19 Bones, costing 4^. produced three ounces : — 
almost as cheap as SeUitbwy G/tie. 

We are informed, that there is now for sale at Leipsig — some Tuns 
of Portable Soup — for Two Shillings per pound. During the late 
war, there was a great deal imported into this country from Russia. 

Ji Knuckle of Veal, weighing 4) pounds, and costing 2t, 4d. pro* 
duced five ounces. 

A Sbiv or Beef, weighing nine pounds, and costing 1«. lO^d. pro- 
duced nine ounces of concentrated Soup, sufficiently reduced to keep 
for several months. After the boiling, the Bones in this joint weighed 
two pounds and a quarter, and the Meat two pounds and a quarter. 

The result of these Experiments is, that the product from tegt and 
ShinM of Beef, was almost as large in quantity, and of nrach superior 
quality and flavour, to that obtained from any of the other materials ; 
.•the flavout of the product from Mutton, Veal, &c. is comparatirely 
insipid. 

As it is difficult to obtain this ready>made of good quality — and we 
could not find any proper and circumstantial directions for making i^ 
which on trial answered the purpose, — and it is really a great acquisi- 
tion to the Army and Navy — ^to Travellers, Invalids, &c. — ^the Editor 
has bestowed some time, &ic. in endeavouring to learn — and to teBch 
how it may be prepared ia the easiest,— most economical and perfect 
manner. 

The ordinary selling price is from lOf. to 12f. — but yon may make 
it according to the above Receipt for Ss. 6d. per Pound— 4. e. for 2^. 
per Ounce, which will make you a Pint of Broth. 

Those who do not regard the expense, and like the flavour, may 
add the ||ean of Ham, in the proportion of a pound to eight pounds o( 
Leg of Beef. 

It may also be flavoured, by adding to it, at the time you put th& 
Broth into the smaller Stewpan, Mushroom Catsup, Shallot Wioe, 
Essences of Spice or Herbs, he. ', — we prefer it quite plain — ^it is then 
ready to be converted in an instant into a basin of Beef Tea for aa

GRAVIES AND SAUCES. 

Melted Butter^ 

Is 80 simple and easy to prepare, it U a matter of general 
aurprise, that what is done so ofteo, ia every English kitdieo, 
is so seldom dooe right. — Foreigners may well say, that al- 
though vre have only One Sauce for Vegetables, Fiab, Fle^ 
Fowl, &c. — ^we hardly ever make that good. 

h i8 spoiled nine times out often^ more from Idkness, ikon 
from Ignorancei and rather because the Cook voo't tban be- 
cause she can't do it^*— which cao only be the ease whea 
Housekeepers will not allow Butter to do it with. 

Good veltsd Butter caonot be made with mere floor and 
water ; there must be a Jvti and proper proportion of Butter, 
—As it must be always on the Table^ aod is the found atiok 
OF ALMOST ALL OUR English SAUCES, I have tried every way 
of making it, and I trust, at last, that I have written a receipt, 
which, if the Cook will carefully observe, she will constantly 
succeed in giving satisfaction. 

In the quantities of the various Sauces I have ordered, 1 
have had in view the providing for a Family of half a dozen 
moderate people. 

Never pour Sauce over Meat, or even put it into the Dish ; 
— ^however well made, some of the Company may have an an- 
tipathy to it :-~Taste8 are as different as Faces : — ^moreover, if 
it is sent up separate in a boat, it will keep hot longer, and what 
is left may be put by for another time, or used for another pur- 
pose.

Butter, Wine, Spice, &c. in the following receipts, ihe pro*

and keep it for use. It will keep good k fortnight in Summer, 
and longer in Winter. 



GRAVIES AKD SAUCU. 211 

A large spoonful will generally be enough to ihicVen a Qaart 
of Gravy. 

O&s. — ^This in the French kitchen is called Roux. Be par- 
ticularly attentive in making of it ; if it gets any burnt smell or 
taste, it will spoil every thing H is put into, see Obs, to (No. 
332.) When cold it should be thick enough to cut out with a 
koife, like a solid paste. 

It is a very essential article in the kitchen, and is the basis of 
consistency io most made dishes, soups, sauces, and ragouts ; — , 
if the Gravies, &c. are too thin, add this Thickening, more or 
less, according to the consistence you would wish them to have. 

Mem. In making Thickening, — the less Butter, and the 
more Flour you use, the better ; — they must be thoroughly 
worked together, and the broth, or soup, &c. you put them to, 
added by degrees ; — take special care to incorporate them well 
together, or your sauces, &c. will taste floury, and have a dis- 
gusting greasy appearance ; — therefore, after you have thicken- 
ed your sauce, add to it some broth, or warm water, in the pro- 
portion of two tablespoonsful to a pint, and set it by the side of 
the fire, to raise any fat, &c. that is not thoroughly incorporated 
with the gravy, which you must carefully remove as it comes to 
the top. This is called, cleansing, or finishing the sauce. 

*^* Half an ounce of Butter, and a tableapoonfid of Flour ^ 
are ibout the jyrqpartien for a pint of Sauce, to rnake it as thick 
as Cream, 

N. B. The Fat Skimmings off the top of the Broth Pot are 
sometimes substituted for Butter, see (No. 940,) — some Cooks 
merely thicken their Soups and Sauces with FUmr, as we have 
directed in (No. 24&,) or Poi$Ltoe Farina (No. 44&) 

. Clarijied Butter. (No. 259.) 

Put the Butter in a nice clean stewpan, over a very clear slow 
fire, watch it, and when it is melted, carefully skim off ther but- 
termilk, &c. which will swim on the top ; — let it stand a minute 
or two, for the impurities to sfiik to the bottom,— then pour the 
clear butter through a sieve, into a clean basin, leaving the sedi- 
ment at the bottom of the stewpan. 

Obs. — Butter thus purified, will be as sweet as Marrow, — a 
very useful coverin'pfor Potted Meats, &c. and for frying Fish, 
equal to the finest Florence oil, for which purpose it is com-

inoDly used by Catholics, and those whose religious teneis will 
not allow them to eat viands fried id animal oil. 

Burnt Butter, <No. 260.) 

Put two ounces of fresh Butter into a small fryingpan, when 
it becoincs a dark brown colour, add to it a tabiespoonful and 
a half of good vinegar, and a little pepper and salt. 

06s. — This is used as sauce for boiled Fish, or poacfaied 
Eggs. 

OUed Butter. (No. ^60*.) 

Put two ounces of fresh Butter into a saucepan, set it at a 
distance from the fire, so that it may melt gradually, till it 
comes to an oil, — and pour it off quietly from the dregs. 

Obs, — This will supply the place of Olive Oil, and by some 
is preferred to it, either for Salads, or Frying. 

Parsley and Butter. (No. 261.) 

Wash some Parsley yery clean, and pick it carefully leaf by 
leaf ; put a teaspoonful of salt into half a pint of boiling water, 
boil the Parsley about ten minutes, d^rain it on a sieve, miooe it 
quite fioe, and then bruise it to a pulp. 

The delicacy and excellence of this elegant and innoceot 
Jlelish, depends upon the Parsley being mioced very fine ; — 
put it into a sauce boat, and mix with it by degrees «bout half 
a pint of good melted butter, (No. S56,) only do ootpatso 
much flour to it, as the Parsley will add to its thickness, — 
never pout Parsley and Butter over boiled things, but send it 
up in a Boat. 

.06s. — In French Cookery Books, this is called ** Melted 

Butter, English FosAion,*' and, with the addition of a slice of 

lemon cut into dice, a little Allspice and Vinegar, ^* DutcA 

Sauce.^^ 

N. B. To Preserve Parsley through the winter, — io June or 
July, lake fine fresh gathered sprigs, pick «nd wash them clean, 
«et on a stewpan half full of water, put a little salt in it, boil and 
skim it clean, and then put In the Parsley and let it boil for a couple 
of minutes, and take it out and lay it on a sieve before the fire, that 
it may be dvied as quick as possible, — put it by in a Tin Box, and 
keep it in a dry place, — when you want it, lay it on a Basin, and 
cover it with warm -water a few minutes before you use it. 

Gooseberry Sauc^., (No. 263.) 

Top and Tail ihem close with a pair Of Scissors, and scald 
half a pint of green Gooseberries, drain them on a hair sieve, 
and put them into half a pint of melted Butter (No. 256.) 



GRAVIES AND SAX3CES. 243 

Some add grated Ginger and Lemon Peel, and the Frencb, 
minced Fennel, — others send up the Gooseberries irbote, or 
mashed, wilhout any butler, &c. 

Chervil, — Basil, — Tarragon, — Burnet, — Cress, — and 

Butter. (No. 264.) 

This id the 6rst time that Chervil, which has so long been a 
favourite with the sagacious French Cook, has been introduced 
into an EInglish book. — Its flavour Is a strong concentration of 
the combined taste of Parsley and Fennel, but more aromatic 
and agreeable than either ; and is an excellent sauce with boil* 
ed Poultry or Bisb. Prepare it, &c. as we have directed for 
Parsley and Butter, (No. 261.) 

Ferniel anA Butter for Mackerel^ Sfc, (No. 265.) 

Is prepared in the same manner as we have just described ia 
(No. 261.) 

Obs. — For Mackerel sauce, or boiled Soles, &c. — some peo- 
ple take equal parts of Fennel and Parsley ; — others add a sprig 
of Mint^ — or a couple of young Onions mioced very fine. 

MackerdRoe Sauce* (No. 266.) 

Boil the Roes of Mackerel, (soft roes are best,)- bruise them 
with a spoon with the yolk of an Egg, beat up with a very lit- 
tle pepper, and salt, and some Fenoel and Parsley boiled and 
chopped very fine, mixed with almost half a pint of thia melted 
butter, see (No. 256.) 
. Mushroom catsup, Walnut pickle, or Soy, may be added.- 

Egg Sauce. (No. 267.) 

This agreeable accompaniment to roasted Poultry, — or salt- 
ed Fish, — is made by putting three Eggs into boiling water, 
and boiling them for about twelve minutes, when they will be 
hard, put them into cold water till you waot them,— this will 
make the Yolks firmer, and prevent their surface turning black, 
and you can cut them much neater, — use only two of the 
Whiles ; cut the Whites into small dice, — the Yolks into bits 
about a quarter of an inch square, — put them into a Sauce-boat, 
pour to them half a pint of melted Butter, and stir them to- 
gether. 

Obs. — The Melted Butter for Egg Sauce need not be made 
^uite so thick as if No. 256.)

Plum Pudding Sauce. (No. 269.) 

A glass of Sherry, half a glass of Brandy, for ^' Cherry- 
Bounce,'') or Curacoa (No. 474,) or Essence of Piiocli (^o. 
471 and 479,) and two teaspoonsful of pounded Jump sugar, 
(a very litde grated Lemon Peel is sontetimes added^) in a 
quarter of a pint of Thick melted butter : grate Nutmeg on the 
top. 

See Pudding Catsup^ (No. 446.) 

Anchovy Sauce, (No. 270.) 

Found three Anchovies in a mortar with a little bit of But- 
ter, rub it through a double Hair sieve, with the back of a 
wooden spoon, and stir it into almost half a pint of Melted 
butler (No. 256 ;) or, stir in a tablespoonful of Esitnce of 
Jinchovxj (No. 438.) — To the above many cooks add Lemon 
Juice, and Cayenne. 

068. — Forei£;ners make this Sauce with good Brown Sauce 
(No. 319,) or White Sauce (No. 364,) instead of melted But- 
ter, — and add to it Catsup, — Soy, — and some of their flavour- 
ed Vinegars, as Elder or Tarragon, — Pepper and fine Spice, 
— Sweet herbf , — Capers, — Eshaliots, &c. They serve li with 
most Roasted Meats. 

N. B. Keep your Anchovies well covered, first tie down 
your Jar with Bladder moistened with vinegar, and then wiped 
dry ; tie Leather over that, — when you open a Jar, moisten the 
bladder, and it will come off easily, — as soon as you have taken 
out the Fish, replace the coverings, — the Air soon rusts and 
spoils Anchovies. See (No. 433,) &c. 

Garlick Sauce. (No. 272.) 

Pound two cloves of Garlick with a piece of fresh Butler 
about ad big as a Nutmeg ; rub it through a double hair sieve, 
add stir it into half a pint of melted butter, or Beef Gravy ; or 
make it with Garlick Vinegar (Nos. 400, 401 and 402.) 

Lemon Sauce, (No. 273.) 

Pare a Lemon, and cut it into slices twice as thick as a half- 
crown piece ; divide these into Dice, and put them into a quar* 
ter of a pint of Melted Butter (No. 266.) 

Ofes. — Some Cooks mince a bit of the Lemon Peel (pared 
very thin) veryfine^ and add it to the above. 

Caper Sawce.— (No. 274.) See also (No. 295.) 

To make a Quarter Pint, — take a tablespoonful of Capers 
and two teaspoonfuls of Vinegar, 






GRAVIES AND SAUCES. ^43 



The jpresent fashion of cutting Copers, — is to nixkoe 
third of them very fine, aod divide the others id half; pot tbem 
into a quarter of a pint of melted Butter, or good thickeaed 
Gravy (No. 3^9,) stir them the same way as yoo did the mete- 
ed butter, or it will oil. 

06s. — Some boil, and mince fine a few leaves of Paisley, or 
Ctiervil, or Tarragon, and add these to the sauce ;^-others tlw 
Juice of half a St-viiie Orange, or Lemon. 

Mejn. — Keep the Caper bottle very closely corked, and do 
not use any of the Caper liquor ; — if the Capers are not well 
covered with it, they will immediately spoil, and it is an excel- 
lent ingredient in Hashes, &;c. The Dutch use it as a Fish 
Sauce, mixing it with Melted butter. 

Afocilc Caper Sauce. (No. 275 or 295.) 

Cut some pickled Green Peas, — French Beans, — Gherkins, 
-—or Nastertiums, into bits the size of Capers ; piit them into 
half a pint of melted butter, with two teaspoonsful of Lemon 
juice, or nice Vinegar. 

Oyster Sauce. (No. 278.) 

Choose Plump and Juicy Natives for this purpose; — donU 
take them out of i^eir Shell till you put them into the Stewpan^ 
see 06s. to (No. 181.) 

To make good Oyster Sauce for half a dozen hearty Fish 
Eaters, you cannot have le^s than three or four dozen Oysters. 
— Save their Liquor, strain it, and put it and tbem into a stew- 
pan ; as soon as they boil and the fish plump, take them off 
the Fire, and pour the contents of the sttMvpan into a sieve over 
a clean basin, wash the stewpan out with 'hot water, and put in- 
to it the strained liquor, with about an equal quantity ot Milk, 
and about two ounces and a half of Butter, with which you 
have well rubbed a large tablespoonful of Flour, — give it a boil 
up, and pour it through a sieve into a basin, (that the Sauce 
may be quite smooth,) and then back again into the saucepan, 
— now, shave the Oysters, and (if you have the honour of mak- 
ing sauce for ** a Committee of Taste, ^ take away the gristly 
part also,) put in only the soft part of the Oysters, (if they 
are very l^rge cut them in half,) and set them by the side of the 
fire to keep hot, '* if they boil after, they will become hard." 

If you have not Liquor enough, add a little Melted Butter, 
or Cream, see (No. 388,) or Milk beat up with the yolk of an 
^SSj (t^i^ "^us^ i^ot be put in till the sauce is done.) Some

barbarous Cooks add Pepper, — or Mace, — tbe juice or pee/ of 
a Lemon, — Horseradish, — Essence of Aocbovy, — Cayeooe, 
&c. ; — but Plaio Sauces are only to taste of tbe logredieot 
from which tbev derive tbeir name. 

06s. — It will very much heighten the flavour of this Saocef 
to pound the soft part of half a dozen (unboiled) Oysters, rub 
it through a hair sieve, and then stir it into the sauce : — this 
Essence of Oyster (and tor some palates a few grains of 
Cayenne) is the only addition we recommend. See (No. 
441.) 

Preserved Oysters. (No. 280.) 

Open the Oysters carefully, so as not to cut them except in 
dividing the gristle which attaches the shells, — put them into a 
Mortar, and when you have got as many as you can coDvenient- 
ly pound at once, add about two drachms of Salt to a dozen 
Oysters, — pound them and rub them through the back of a 
hair sieve, and put them into a mortar again, with as much 
Flour (which has been previously thoroughly dried) as will 
make them into a paste, roll it out several times, aod lastly, 
flour it and roll it out the thickness of a half crown, and divide 
it into pieces about an inch square, lay them in a Dutch oven, 
where they will dry so gently as not to get burned, — turn them 
every half hour, and when they begin to dry, crumble them, — 
they \w\\] take about four hours to dry, — then pound tbem fine, 
sift them and put into bottles, and seal them over. 

N. B, Three dozen Natives required 7 1-2 ounces o! 
dried Fiour to make them into a paste, which then weighed II 
ounces, — when dried and powdered, 6 1-4 ounces. 

To make half a pint of Sauce, put one ounce of Butter into 
a stewpan, with three drachms of Oyster powder, and six ta- 
blespoonsful of milk ; set it on a slow fire, stir it till it boils, 
and season it with salt. 

This Powder, if made with Plump Juicy Natives, will 
abound with the flavour of the Fish, and if closely corked, and 
kept in a dry piacn, will remain good for some time. 

06s. — This Extract is a welcome succedaneum while Oys- 
ters are out of season, and in such inland parts as seldom have 
auy, is a valuable addition to the list of Fish saucea : it is 



6IEAVIE9 AKD SATJC^, 347 

equally good with boiled Fowl, or Ramp SleaV,— tDd spria- 
kied on Bread and Batter makes a very good Saodwich, aod is 
especially worthy the notice of Country Housekeepers — and as 
a Store Sauce for the Army aad Navy. See Anchovy P&wder 
(No. 435.) 

Shrimp Sauce, (No. 283.) 

Shell a pint of Shrimps, pick them clean, wash them, and 
put them into half a pint of good Melted Butter. 

Obs, — Some stew the Heads and Shells of the Shrimps, 
(with or without a blade of bruised Mace,) tor a quarter of an 
hour, and strain off the liquor to melt the butter with, and add 
a little Lemon Juice, — Cayenne, — and Essence of Anchovy, 
—or Soy,— Cavice, &c.— but the Flavour of the Shrimp is so 
delicaU, it will be overcome by any ot those additions. 

Lobster Sauce. (No. 284.) 

Choose a fine Spawny Hen Lobster,+ be sure it is fresh, so 
get a live one if you can, (one of my culinary predecessors 
says, " let it be heavy and lively *^) and boil it as (No. 17.6,) 
pick out the Spawn and the Red Coral into a mortar, add to it 
half an ounce of Butter, pound it quite smooth, and rub it 
through a hair sieve with, the back of a wooden spoon ; cut the 
meat of the Lobster into small squares, or pull it to pieces with 
a fork, put the pounded Spawn into as much melted Butter 
(No. 256,) as you think will do, and stir it together till it is 
thoroughly mixed, — now put to it the meat of the Lobster, and 
warm it on the fire, take care it does not boil^ which udill spoil its 
complexion^ and its brilliant Red colour icill immediately fade. 

The above is a very easy and excellent manner of making 
this Sauce. 

Some use strong Beef or Veal Gravy instead of melted But- 
ter, adding Anchovy, Cayenne, Catsup, Cavice, Lemon juice 
or pickle, or Wine, &c. 

06s. — Save a little of the inside Red Coral Spawn, and rub 
it through a sieve (without butter) ; — it is a very ornamental 

rnisb to sprinkle over Fish ; and if the skin is broken (which 



t You must have a Hen Lobster, on account of the Live Spawn 

me Fishmongers have a cruel custom of tearing this from the Fish 
eforc they are boihd ; — lift up the tail of the Lobster, and see that it 
as not been robbed of its Eggs ; — the goodness of your Sauce depends 
ipon its having a full share of the Spawn in it, to which it owes not 
nerely its brilliant Red Colour, but th« finest part of its Flavour.

N. B. Various methods have been tried to Preserve Lo»- 
stERs, see (No. 1T8,) and Lobster Spawn, for a Store Sauce. 
The Live Spawn may be kept some time in stroog Salt and 
Water — or in an Ice House. 

The following process might, perhaps, preserve it longer ;— 
Put it into a Saucepan of boiling water, with a large spoonful 
of Salt in it, and let it boil quick for ^ve minutes ; then draio 
it on a hair sieve, spread it out thin on a plate, and set it in a 
Dutch Oven till it is thoroughly dried, — grind it in a clean mill, 
and pack it closely iti well-stopped Bottles. See also Potted 
Lobstersy (No. 178.) 

Sauce for Lobsters, Sfc. — (No. 285.) See also (No. 372.) 

Bruise the yolks of two hard boiled Eggs with the back of 
a wooden spoon, or rather pound them in a mortar, with a tea- 
spoonfu) of water, and the soft inside and the spawn of the 
lobster, rub them quite smooth, with a teaspoonful of made 
Mustard, two tabfespoonsful of Salad Oil, and five of Vinegar; 
season it with a very little Cayenne ^^epperand some salt. 

Obs. — To this. Elder or Tarragon Vinegar (No. 396,) or 
Anchovy Essence, (No. 433,) is occasionally added. 

Liver and Parsley Sauce, — (No. 287.) — or Liver and 

Lemon Sauce. 

Wash the Liver (it must be perfectly fresh) of a Fowl or 
Rabbit, and boil it five minutes in five tablespoonsful o( wa- 
ter ; — chop it fine ; or pound or bruise it in a small quao^hy of 
the liquor it was boiled in, and rub it through a sieve : — wasb 
about one-third the bulk of Parsley leaves, put them on toboil 
in a little foiling water, with a teaspoonful of salt in it ; lay il 
on a hair sieve to drain, and mince it very fine; mix it wi^h 
the liver, and put it into a quarter pint of melted butler, and 
warm it up ; — do not 1ft it boil. 

Or, 

To malce Lemon and Liver Sauce, 

Pare off the rind of a Lemon, or of a Seville Orange, as tbia 

as pofl'si! le, so as not to cut offany of the White with it; — now 

cut oiTail the white, and cut the Lemon into slices, about as

thick as a coupla of half-crowns; pick out ibe pipe, and di- 
vide the slices into small squares ; add these, and a little of the 
peel minced very fine, to the Liver, prepared as directed above 
and put them into the melted Butter, and vparm them together, 
— but do not let them boil. 

N. B. The Poulterers can always let you have freik Livers 
— if that of the Fowl or Rabbit is not good, or not large enongh 
to make as much Sauce as you wish. 

Obs, — Some Cooks, instead of pounding, — mince the Liver 
very fine (with half as much Bacon), and leave out the Pars- 
ley,— -others add the juice of half a Lemon, and some of the 
Peel grated, — or a teaspoon ful of Tarragon or Chili Vinegar, 
a tablespoonful of White Wine, or a little beaten Mace or 
Nutmeg, or Allspice : — if you wish it a little more lively on 
the palate, pound a Shallot, or a few leaves of Tarragon or 
Basil, with Anchovy or Catsup, or Cayenne, 

Idver Sauce for Fish. (No. 988.) 

Boil the Liver of the Fish^and pound it in a mortar with a 
little flour, stir it into some Broth, or some of the liquor the 
Fish was boiled in, or melted Butter, Parsley, and a few grains 
of Cayenne ;—oa little Essence of Anchovy (No. 433,) or Soy, 
or Catsup (No. 439) ;«--^ive it a boil up, and rub it through a 
sieve : — you may add a little Lemon Juice^^or Lemon cat in 
dice. 

Celery Sauce, White. (No. 289.) 

Pick and wash two heads of nice white Celery ; cut it into 
pieces about an inch long ; stew it in a pint of water, and a 
teaspoonful of salt, till the Celery is tender*; roll an ounce of 
butter with a tablespoonful of flour ; add this to half a pint of 
cream, and give it a boil up.

cream or milk ; boil it a quarter of an hour, and pass through 
a fine bair sieve with the back of a spoon. 

If you wish for Celery sauce, when Celery is not in season, 
a quarter of a drachm of Celery-seedf or a little Ksseoce of 
Celery (No. 409,) will impregnate half a pint of sauce with 
a sufficient portion of the flavour of the Vegetable. 

See 06s. to (No. 214.) 

Greerij or Sorrel Sauce, (No. 291.) 

Wash and clean a large Ponnet of Sorrel, put it into a 
Stevvpan that will just hold it, with a bit of Butter the size of 
an Egg, cover it close, set it over a slow fire for a quarter of an 
hour, pass the Sorrel with the back of a wooden spooa through 
a hair sieve, season with Pepper, Salt, and a small pinch of 
powdered Sugar, make it hot, and serve up under Lamb, Veal,. 
Sweetbreads, &c. &c. Cayenne, Nutmegi and Lemon. 
Juice, are sometimes added. 

Tomato, or Love-apple Sauce, — (No. 292.) See aZs» (443.); 

Have twelve or fifteen Tomatas ripe, and red ; take off the 
stalk ; cut them in half, squeeze them just enough to get all the 
water and seeds out ; put ttiem in a stewpan, with a (Japsicum, 
and two or three tablespoonsful of Beef Gravy ; set them on a 
slow stove for an hour, or till properly melted ; then rub them 
through a tammis into a clean stewpan, with a little white pep- 
per and salt, and let them simmer together a few minutes. 

N. B. To the above tbe French Cook adds an Onion or 
Eshallot, a Cbve or two, or a little Tarragon Vinegar. 

Mock Tomata Sauce. (No. 293.) 

The only difference between this, and genuine Love-apple 
Sauce, is the substituting the pulp of Apple for that of Toma- 
ta, colouring it with Turmerfc, and communicating an acid fla- 
vour to it by vinegar. 

Shallot Sauce. (No. 294.) 

Take four Shallots, and make it in the same manner as 
Garlic Sauce (No. 272.) 

Or, 
You may make this sauce more extemporaneously, by put- 
ting two tablespoonsful of Shallot Wine (No. 403,). and a

many ate very fond of it with roasted or Boiled Meat, Poul- 
tcy, Ssc, 

ShaMot Sauce^for Boiled Mutton. (No. 295.) 

This is a very frequent and satisfactory substitute for ^Caper 
SauceJ^ 

Mince four Shallots very -fine, and put them into a small 
saucepan, with almost half a pint of the liquor the Mutton was 
boiled in ; let them boilup for five minutes ; — then put in a 
tablespoonful of Vinegar, a quarter teaspoonful of Pepper, a 
little Salt, and a bit of Butter (as big as a walnut) rolled in 
flour: shake together, till it boil. See(No.402,) Eshallot fVine. 

Obs. — ^We like a Utile Lemon Peel with Shallot ; — the 
Haul -Gout of the latter is much ameliorated by the delicate 
Aroma of the former. 

Some Cooks add a little 6 neLy chopped Parsley. 

Yming Onion Sauce. (No. 296.) 

Peel a pint of Button Onions, and put them in water till 
you want to put them on to boil ; put them in a stewpan, with 
a quart of cdd water ; let them boil till tender; they will take 
(according to their size and age) from hi/If an hour to an hour. 
You may put them into half a pint of (No. 307.) See also 
(No. 137.) 

Onion Sauce. (No. 297.) 

Those who like the full flavour of Onions, only cut off the 
strings and'tops (without peeling off any of the skins), put 
them into salt and water, and let them lie an hour ; then wash 
them, put them into a kettle with plenty of water, and boil 
them till they are tender: now skin them, pass them through a 
cullender, and mix a little mehed Butter with them. 

N, B. Some mix the pulp of Apples, or Turnips, with the 
Onions, — others add Mustard to them.

board and chop and bruise them, pnt th«m into a efean sauce- 
pan, with some Butter and Flour, half a teaspoooful of salt, 
and some Cream, or good milk ; stir it till it boils ; then tab 
the whole through a tammy or sieve, adding cream or milk, to 
make it the consistence you wish. 

068. — This is the usual sauce for boiled Rabbits, — M uttoo, 
-—or Tripe* — There must be plenty of it ; the usual expres- 
sion signifies as much, for we say, maoiher them with it. 

JBroton Onion Sauce^ or Onion Gravy, (No. 299.) 

Peel and slice the Onions (some put in an equal quantity of 
Cucumber or Celery) into a quart stewpan, with an otince of 
Butter ; set it on a slow fire, and turn the Onion about till it is 
very lightly browned ; now gradually stir in half an ounce. of 
Flour ; add a' little broth, and a little pepper and salt, boil op 
for a few minutes,add a tablespoonful of Claret, or Port wine, 
and same of Mushroom Catsup, — (you may sharpen it Wwh a 
little Lemon Juice or Vinegar) — and rub it through a tammy, 
or fine sieve. 

Curry Powder (No. 348,) will convert this into ezcelleBt 
Curry Sauce. 

N. B. If this Sauce is for Steaks, shred an ounce of 
Onions, fry them a nice brown, and put them to the sauce you 
have rubbed through a tammy ; — or some very amaU round 
young silver Button Onions, see (No. ^96,) peeled and boiled 
tender, and put in whole when your Sauce is done, will be an 
acceptable addilion. 

Obs. — If you have no Broth, put in half a' pint of water, 
and see (No.25^) ; — just before you give it the last boiiup,add 
to it another (ablespoouful of Mushroom Catsup, or the same 
quantity of Port Wine or good Ale. 

The flavour of this Sauce may be varied by adding Tarra- 
gon or Burnet Vioger, (Nos. 396 and 399.) 

Sage and OnloUy or Goose-string Sauce, (No. 300.) 
Chop very fine an ounce of Onion and half an ounce of

crumbs ; mix well together ; — then pour to it a quarter of a 
piDt of (Broth, or Gravy, or) MeJted Butter, stir well together, 
aod simmer it a few minutes longer. 

O&s.— This is a very relishing Sauce for Roast Pork, Geese, 
or Ducks : or Green Pease on Maigre Days, 

See also Borme Bouche for the above, (No. 341.) 

Green Mint Sauce, (No. 303.) 

Wash half a handful of nice young fresh-gat hered Green 
Mintj (to this some add one-third the quantity of Parsley,) 
pick the leaves from.the stalks, mince them very fine, and put 
them into a sauceboat, with a teaspoonful of moist Sugar, and 
four tablespoonsful of Vinegar. 

0&8. — This is the usual accompaniment to Hot Lamb ; — 
and an equally agreeable relish with Cold Lamb. 

If Green Mint cannot be procured, this sauce may be made 
witk Mint Vinegar^ (No. 398.) 

A]^le Sauce, (No. 304.) 

Pare and core three good sized baking Apples, put them into 
a well-tinned pint saucepan, with two tablespoonsful of cold 
water ; cover the saucepan close, and set it on a trivet over a 
slow fire a couple of hours before dinner, — some Apples will 
take a long time stewing, — others will be ready in a quarter of 
an hour: — when the Apples are done enough, pour off the 
water, let them stand a few minutes to get dry ; then beat them 
up with a Fork, with a bit of Butter about as big as a Nutmeg, 
and a teaspoonful of powdered Sugar. 

N. B. Some add Lemon Peel, grated, or minced fine, — or 
boil a bit with the Apples. 

Mushroom Sauce, (No. 305.) 

Pick and peel half a pint of Mushrooms (the smaller tie 

better,) wash them very clean, and put them into a saucepan

spoonful of good Double Mushroom Catsup, (No. 439,) 
S<*e Quintessence of Mushrooms, (No. 440.) 
N. B. Much as ne love the flavour of Mushrooms, — we 
must enter our protest against their being eatea ia substance, — 
when the morbid eflects they produce too often prove tbem 
worthy of the appellations Seneca gave them, " Voluptuous 
Potson,*' *'' lethal luxury," &c, ; and we caution those who 
cannot refrain from indulging their palate with the seducing 
reliiib of this deceitful Fungus, to masticate it diligently. 

We do not believe that Mushrooms are nutritive, — every 
one know« they are often dangerously indigestible, — therefore 
the Rational Epicure will be content with extracting the flavour 
from them — which it* obtained in the utmost perfection by the 
process directed in (No. 4S9.) 

Mushroom Sauce^ Brown, (No. 306.) 

Put the Mushrooms into half a pfnt of Beef Gravy (No. 
1 86,) or (No. 3^9) ; thicken with Flour and Butter ; and 
proceed as above. 

Mttshroom Sauce, Ejttempore, (No. 307.) 

Proceed as directed in (No. 256,) to melt Butter, — only in-

Catsup (No. 439 or 40 ;) — or add it to thickened Broth, Gra- 
vy, or Mock Turtle Soup, &c.-^or put in tNo. 296.) 

Obs, — This is a welcome Relish with Fish — Poultry — or 
Chops and Steaks, &c, A couple of Quarts of good Catsup 
(No. 439,) will make more good Sauce than ten times its cost 
of Meat, &c. 

Walnut Catsup will give you another variety ; and Bai.l*s

Fried Parsley. (No. 3 J 7.) 

Let it be nicely picked aod washed, then put into a clotb, 
anil swung backwards aod forwards till it is perfectly dry ; — 
put it into a pan of hot fat, fry it quick, and have a slice ready 
to take it out the moment it is crisp, (in another moment it will 
be spoilt ;) put it oo a sieve, or coarse cloth, before the fire to 
drain. 

Crisp Parsley. (No. 318.) 

Pick and wash young Parsley, shake it in a dry clofh {a 
drain the water from it ; spread it on a sheet of clean paper, in 
a Dutch oven before the fire, and turn it frequently until it is 
quite crisp. — This is a much more easy way of preparing it 
than Frying it, — which is not seldom ill done. 

06s. — A very pretty garnish for Lamb Chops, Fish, &c. 

Fned Bread Sippets. (No. 319.) 

Cut a slice of Bread about a quarter of an inch thick, divide 
it with a sharp knife into pieces two inches square ; — shape 
these into Triangles or Crosses: — put some very clean Fat inta 
an iron Fryingpao ; when it is hot, put in the sippets, aod fry 
them a delicate light hrovm ; take them up with a Fish-slice,, 
and drain them well from Fat, turning them occasionally ;^- 
this will take a quarter of an hour. Keep the pan at such a 
distance from the fire, that the fat may be hot enough to brown 
without burning ; — this is a requisite precaution in frying deli- 
cate thin things. 

06s. — These are a pretty Garnish^ and very welcome bo- 
companimentand improvement to the finest made Dishes:— 
they may also be sent up with Pease and other Soups ; — hot 
when intended for Soups, the Bread must be cut into bits, 
about half an inch square. 

N. B. If these are not done vein/ delicately clean and dry^ 
they are uneatable. 

Fried Bread Crumbs. (No. 320.) 

Rub Bread (which has been baked two days) through a wire 
sieve, or Cullender ; — or you may rub them in a cloth till they 
are as fine as if they had been grated and sifted ; — put them 
into a stewpan with a couple of ounces of Butter, place it over 
a moderate 6re, and stir them about with a wooden spoon till 
they are the colour of a Guinea ; spread them on a sieve, and 
let them stand ten minutes to drain, turning them frequently.

enough. 

Bread Sauce. (No. 321.) 

Put a small teacupful of Bread-Crumbs into a ste\vpan,pour 
on it as much milk as it will soak up, and a little more ; or, ia* 
stead of the milk, take the Giblets, bead, neck, and legs, &c. 
of the Poultry, &c. and stew tbero, and moisten the bread with 
this liquor ; put it on the fire, with a middling sized Onion, 
and a dozen berries of Pepper or Allspice, or a littlu Mace; 
let it boil, then stir it well, and let it simmer till it is quite stiff', 
and then put to it about two tablespoonsful of Cream or melted 
Butter, or a Utile good Broth ^ take out the Onion and Pepper, 
and it is res^dy. 

06s. — This is an excellent accompaniment to Game and 
Poultry, &c. and a good vehicle for receiving various flavours 
from THE Magazine op Taste (No. 463.) 

Rice Sauce. (No. 321».) 

Steep a quarter pound of Rice in a piot of milk, with Onion, 
Pepper, &c. as in the last receipt; when the Rice is quite ten- 
der (take out the spice,) rub it through a sieve into a clean 
stewpan ; if too thick, put a little milk or cream to il. 

Obs. — This is a very delicate White sauce ; — and at elegant 

tables, is frequently served instead of Bread Sauce.

Browning (No. 3^2.) 

Is a convenient article to colour those Soups or Sauces^. 
of which it is supposed their deep brown complexion denotes 
the strength and savouriness of the composition. 

Burnt Sugar is also a favourite ingredient with the Brewers, 
who use it under the name of '* Essentia Bina" to colour their 
Beer ; it is also employed by the Brandy makers, in considera* 
ble quantity, to colour Brandy ; to which, besides enriching 
its complexion, it gives that sweetish taste, and fulness in the 
mouth, which custom has taught Brandy drinkers to admire, 
and prefer to the finest Cogniac in its genuine state. 

When employed for Culinary Purposes, this is sometimes 
made with strong Gravy, or Walnut Catsup. Those who lika 
a godit of Acid may add a little Walnut Pickle.

It will hardly ba told from whaC is commoDly called ^* genU" 
ine Japanese Soy*," for which it is a very good 8ubsti(ate. 
Burot Treacle, or Sugar, the Peels of Walnuts, Cayeane pep- 
per, or Capsicums, or ChiMies, Vinegar, Garlick, and pickled 
Herrings, (especially the Dutch) — Sardiaias, or Sprats, appear 
to be the bases of almost ail the Sauces which now, to use the 
maker^s phrase, stand unrivalled. 

Although indefatigable research and experiment has put us 
in possession of these compositions, — it would not be quite 
fair to enrich the Cook, at the expense of the Oilman, &c.— 
we hope we have said enough on these subjects, to satisfy "the 
Rational Epicure.'^ 

Put half a pound of pounded Lump Sugar, and a table- 
sf^oonful of water into a clean iron saucepan, set it over a slow 
fire, and keep stirring it with a wooden spoon till it becomes a 
bright brown colour, and begins to smoke ; then add to it an 
ounce of salt, and dilute it by degrees with water, till it is the 
thickness of Soy ; let it boil, take off the scum, and strain the 
liquor into bottles, which must be well stopped : if you have 
not any of this by you, and you wish to darken the colour of 
ybur sauces, pound a teaspoonful of lump sugar, and put into 
an iron spoon, with as much water as will dissolve it ; bold it 
over a quick fire til! it becomes of a very dark brown colour; 
mix' it with the soup. Sec, while it is hot. 

Obs. — Most of the preparations uoder this title are a roedlej of 
burnt Butter, — Spices, — Gatsup, — Wine, &c. We recommend the Ra- 
tional Epicure to be content with the naiurcU colour of Soups and Sctu- 
ceSj which, to a well educated Palate, are much more agreeable, with- 
out any of these empyreumatic additions ; — however they may please 
the Eye, they plague the Stomach most grievously, so " open your 
Mouth and »hut your Eyes.** 

For the sake of producing a pretty colour, " Cheese'* — Cayenne 
(No. 404,) — " Essence of Anchovy" (No. 433,) &c. are frequently 
adulterated with a colouring matter containing Red Lead ! ! — See 
Ac CUM on the adulteration of Food. 

A scientific " homme de bouche de France** observes — " The gene* 
rality of Cooks calcine Bones, till they are as black as a Coal, and 
throw them hissing hot into the stewpan, to give a brown colour to 
their Broths. These ingredients, under the appearance of a nourish-

Gj^avyfor Roast Meat, (No. 326.) 

Most joints will afford sufficient trimmings, &c, to make half 
a pint of plaio Gravy, which you may colour with a few drops 
of (No. 3M ;)— -for those that do not, about half ao hour be- 
fore you think the meat will be done, mix a saltspoonful of 
Salt, with a full quarter pint of boiling Water ; drop this by 
degrees on the brown parts of the joint ; set a dish under to 
catch it, (tlie meat will soon brown again) ; set it by, — as it 
cools, the fat will settle on the surface ; when the meat is ready, 
remove this, and warm up the gravy, and pour it into the dish. 

The Common Method is, when the meat is in the dish yon 
intend to send it up in, to mix half a teaspoonful of Salt in a 
quarter pint of boiling water, and to drop some of this over 
the corners and underside of the meat, and to pour the rest 
through the hole the spit came out of, — and some pierce the 
inferior parts of the joint with a sharp skewer. 

The following receipt was given us bf a very good Cook : 
You may make good Browning for Roast Meat and Poultry, 
by saving the Brpvm Bits of Roast Meat or Broiled ; cut 
them into small bits, put them into a basin, cover them with 
boiling water, and put them away till next day ; then put it 
into a saucepan, let it boil two or three minutes, strain it 
through a sieve into a basin, and put it away for use. When 
yon want Gravy for Roast Meat, put two tablespoonful into 
ball a pint of boiling water with a little salt; — if for Roasted 
Veal, put three tablespoousful into half a pint of thin melted 
Butter. 

N. B. The Gravy which comes down in the dish, the Cook 

(if she is a good housewife) will preserve to enrich Hashes 

OR LITTLE Made Dishes, &c. 

Obs. — Some Culinary professors, who think nothing can be exceU 
lent, that is not extravagant^ — call this '< Scots Gravv ;" not, I be- 
lieTe, intending it, as it certainly is, a compliment to the laudable, and 
rational frugality, of that intelligent and sober-minded People.

about two hours, then strain it through a sieve into a basin, 
^ow, if you wiab to thicken it, set a clean stewpan over a 
slow tire, with about an ounce of Butter in it; when it is 
melted, dredge to it (by degrees) as much flour as will dry it 
up, stirrmg them well together ; when thoroughly mixed, pour 
in a little of the Gravy, — stir it well together, and add the re- 
mainder by degrees ; set it over the fire, let it simmer gently 
for fifteen or twenty minutes longer, and skim off the fat, &c. 
as it rises; when it is about as thick as cream, squeeze it 
through a tammis, or fine sieve, — and you will have a fine rich 
Brown Sauce, at a very moderate Expense, and without much 
trouble. 

06». — If you wish io make it still more Relishing^ — if it is 
for Poultry, you may pound the Liver with a bit of Butter, rub 
it through a sieve, and stir it into the Sauce when you put in

See the Magazine of Taste, (No, 463.)

The best gravy for Venison, is tbat made with the trimmings 
of the Joiot: — if this is all used, and you have no undressoi 
Venison, cut a scrag of mutton in pieces, broil it a little browo, 
then put it into a clean stewpan, with a quart of boiling water, 
cover it close, and let it simmer gently for an hour ; now un- 
cover the stewpan, and let it reduce to three quarters of a piot, 
pour it through a hair sieve, take the fat off, and send it up in a 
boat, — It is only to be seasoned with a little salt, that it may 
not overpower the natural flavour of the meat. You may co- 
lour it with a very little of (No. 322.)

rub them well together till quite smooth.

you suspect they are not *' morning gathered,*' they will be 

much refreshed by laying an hour in cold spring water ; then 

carefully wash and pick then, and trim o£f all the worm-eateo, 

slimy, cankered, dry leaves, and after washing, let them remaia 

a while in the cullender to drain, lastly swing them gently io a 

clean coarse napkin ;-^wheo properly picked and cut, arrange 

them in the Salad Dish, — mix the Sauce io a Soup plate, and 

put it into an Ingredient Bottlef , or pour it down the side of the 

Salad Dish, — and don't stir it till the mouths are ready for it. 

If the Herbs be young, — fresh gathered, — trimmed neatly, 

and drained dry, — and the Sauce maker ponders patiently over 

the following directions, — he cannot fail obtaining the fame of 

being a very accomplished Salad-dresser.

with a tablespoonful of Water, or fine double Cream, then add 
two tablespoonfuls of Oil or melted Butler ; when these are 
well mixed, add by degrees, a teaspoon ful of Salt, or powdered 
lump Sugar, and the same of made Mustard ; when these are 
smoolbly united, add very graduially three tablespooosful of 
Vinegar, rub it with the other ingredients till thoroughly incor- 
porated with them : cut up the white of the egg, and garnish 
the top of the salad with it. Let the Sauce remain at the bot- 
tom of the Bowl, and do not stir up the Salad till itis to be eat- 
en ; — we recommend the Eaters to be mindful of the duty of 
mastication, — without the due performance of which, all un-

Forcemeat is now considered an indispensable aocompani-

taste, ^ives additional spirit and relish to e?en that '* Sorenigo 
of Savouriness," Turtle soup. 

It is also sent up in Patties, and for stuffing of Veal, Game, 
Poultry, &c. 

The ingredients should be so proportioned, that no one fla- 
TOur predominates ; — instead of giving the same stuffing for 
Veal, Hare, &c. with a little contrivance, you may make as 
great a variety as you have Dishes. 

I have given Receipts for some of the most favourijte com- 
positions, and a Table of Maierials, a glance at which will en- 
able the ingenious Cook to make an infinite variety of combi- 
nations ; the first tolumn coptaining the spirit, the second ih&- 
substance of them. 

The poignancy of Forcemeat should be proportioned to the > 
savouriness of the viands, to which it is intended to give an 
additional Zest. Some dishes require a very delicately flavour* 
ed forcemeat,-— for others, it must be full and high seasoned. 
What would hepiquante in a Turkey, would be insipid with 
Turtle. 

Tastes are so different, — and the praise the Cook recieves, 
will depend so much on her pleasing the palate of those she 
works for, that all her sagaciy must be on the alert, to produce 
the flavours to which her employers are partial. See page 59

The.best way to make this, is to pour three pints of the best 
white wine Yinegar on a pint and a half of fresh-gathered Red 
Raspberries in a stone Jar, or China bowl, (neither glazed 
earthen vxire^ nor any metallic vessel, must be used ; ) the next 
day strain the liquor over a like quantity of fresh Raspberries ; 
and the day following do the same. Then drain off the liquor 
without pressing, and pass it through a Jelly Bag (pref iousfy 
wetted with plain Vinegar) into a stone Jar, with a pound of 
pounded lump Sugar to each pint. When the Sugar is dis- 
solved, stir it up, cover down the Jar, and set it in a saucepan of 
water, and keep it boiling for an hour, taking off the scum ; 
add to each pint a glass of Brandy, and bottle it : mixed in 
aboQt eight parts of water, it is a very refreshing and delightful 
Summer drink. An excellent cooling beverage to assuage 
. thirst in ardent fevers, colds, and inflammatory complaints, Sse,

a.od let them steep, for ten days ; if you wish a very strong £s- 
sence, strain the liquor, put in some fresh leaves, and let them 
steep foorteen days more. 

Obs, — This is a very agreeable additidn to Sauces, — Soups, 
and to the mixture usually made for Salads, see (No. 37%) and 
(No. 453.) 

It is a secret the makers of Mock Turtle may thank us 
for telling ; a tablespoonful of this, put in when the Soup is 
finished, will Impregnate a Tureen of soup, with the Basil, and 
Acid flavours, at very small cost, when fresh Basil and Lemons 
are extravagantly dear. 

The flavour of the other Sweet, and Savoury Herbs, —

Dry, and pound half an ounce of Cress Seed, (such as is 
sown in the garden with Mustard,) pour .upon it« quart of ibe

06s. — This is very strongly flavoured with Cress, — and for 
Salads, and Coid Mf;ats, &c, is a great favourite with many ; — 
the Quart of Sauce costs only, a half-penny more than ike Via"

Celery Vinegar is made.in the same manner. 

The Crystal Vinegar (No. 407*) which is, we believe (he 
Pyroligneous Acid, is the best for receiving flavours, — having 
scarcely any of its own.

days, shaking it well every day ; then pour off the clear liquor 
into small bottles. 

ObSt-^Tbs. Cook must be careful not to use too much of 
this : — a few drops of it will give a pint of Oravy a suflBctent 
smack of the Garlick ; the flavour of which, when slight, and 
well blended, is one of the finest we have ;-^when used in ex- 
cess, it is the most offensive. 

The best way to use Garlick, is to send up some of this Vin-

others obtained from respectable Oil Shops in London, he has extract- 
ed Lead ! 

" Foreign Cayenne Pepper is an indiscriminate mixture of 
the powder of the dried pods of many species of Capsicums, — 
especially of the Bird Pepper^ which is the hottest of all. As 
it comes to us from the West Indies, it changes the infusion of

TarnBoIe to a beautiful Green, — probably omng to the Salt 
which 18 always added to it, and the Red Oxid aJT'Ltead, «i.tb 
which it is said to be adulterated.^-^DuirGAN^s New Eain' 
hurgh Dispensatory. ^ 

The Indian Cayenne is prepared in a very careless manner^ 
and often looks as if the pods had lain till they were decayed, 
before they were dried ; — ^this accounts for the dirty brofwn ap-> 
pearance it commonly has. If properly dried as soon as gath- 
ered, it will be of a clear red colour ; to give it the oomplezioa 
of that made with good fresh-gathered Copstcicma or ChiUies^ 
some AmattOj or other vegetable Red colouring matter, is 
pounded with it ; this, Mr. A., assures us, is frequently adalterat-^ 
ed Mitb Indian Red,t. e. *' Red Lead T^ 

When Cayenne is pounded, it is mixed with a coostderabW 
portion of Salt, to prevent its flying up and hurting the Eyes : 
this might be avoided, by grinding it in a Mill, which may ea- 
sily be made close enough, especially if it be passed through a 
second time, and then sifted through a fine drum headed sieve, 
to produce as fine a powder as can be obtained by poundiog ; 
however, our English Chillies may be pounded in a deep mor- 
tar without any danger. 

Capsicums and Chillies are ripe and red, and in finest condi- 
tion during September and October ; the flavour of the CkU- 
lies is very superior to that of the Capsicums,— and will be 
good in proportion as they are dried as soon as possible, taking 
care they are not bur-nt. 

Take away the stalks, and put the pods into a Cullender ; 
set it before the Fire ; they will take full twelve hours to dry ; 
then put them into a mortar, with one-fourth their weight of 
salt, and pound them and rub them till they are as fine as possi- 
ble, and put them into a well stopped* bottle. 

N. B. We advise those who are fond of Cayenne, not to 
think it too much trouble to make it of English Chillies, — 
there is no other way of being sure it is genuine, — and they 
will obtain a Pepper of much finer flavour, without half the 
beat of the Foreign. 

A hundred large Chillies, costing only Two Shillings, will 
produce you about two ounces of Cayenne, — so it is as cheap 
as the commonest Cayenne.

Emence of Cayenne. (No. 406.) 

Pat half an ounce of Cayenne Pepper (No. 404,) into half 
a pint of Brandy, or Wine ; let it steep for a fortnight, and 
then pour off the clear h'quor. 

This is nearly equal to fresh Chilli juice, 
06s. — It is extremely convenient for the extempore season- 
ing, and finishing of Soup, Sauces, &;c. its flavour being in" 
stanUy, and equally diffused. Cayenne Pepper varies so much 
in strength, that it is impossible to season Soup any other way 
to the precise point o^piquance. 

Chilli Vinegar. (No. 405*.) 

This is commonly made with the Foreign Bird Pepper^ — 
but you will obtain a much finer flavour from infusing fifty 
fresh Red English Chillies (cut in half, or pounded,) in a pint 
of the best Vinegar for a fortnight, or a quarter ounce of Cay- 
enne Pepper, (No. 404.) 

O^. — Many people cannot eat Fish without the addition of 
an Acid, and Cayenne Pepper ^ to such palates, this will be 
an agreeable relish. 

Chilli^ or Cayenne Wine. (No. 405**.) 

Pound and steep fifty fresh Red Chillies, or a quarter of an 
ounce of Cayenne Pepper, in half a pint of Brandy, White 
Wine, or Claret, for fourteen days. 

06s. — This is a ** Bonne Bouche^^ for the 4overs of Cay- 
enne, of which it takes up a larger proportion of its flavour, 
than of its fire ; which being instantly diffused, it is a very use- 
ful auxiliary to warm and finish Soups and Sauces, &;c. 

Essence of Lemon Peel. (No. 407.) 

Wiasb and brush clean the Lemons ; — let them gel perfectly 
dry ; — take a lump of Loaf Sugar, and rub them till all the 
yellow rind is taken up by the sugar ; — scrape off the surface of 
the sugar into a preserving pot, and )>ress it hard down ; cover 
it very close, and it will keep for some time. 

In the same way you may get the essence of Seville Orange 
Peel. 

Obs. — This method of procuring, and preserving the flavour 
of Lemon Peel, by making an Oleo'saccharum, is far superior 
to the common practice of paring off the rind, or grating it, and

If you add a drachm of Lump Sugar pounded, and six drops 
of (No. 403,) to three ounces of Crystal Vinegar^ (which is 
the name given to the Pyroligneous Vinegar,) you will have an 
excellent substitute for Lemon Juice — for Fish Sauces aad 
Soups, and many other Culinary purposes. The flavour of the 
Lemoa may also be communicated to the Vinegar — hy iiifua* 
log some Lemon Peel in it. 

N. B. The Pyroligneous Vinegar is perfectly free from all 
flavour, save that of the pure Acid, — therefore it is a ^ery val- 
uable menstruum for receiving impregnations from various fla« 
vouriog materials. 

The Pt&olignbous Acid seems likely to produce quite a

equal to drawn-gravy, and as likely to put your Lingual nerves

To make a boat of Sauce for Poultry, &c. put a piece of 
butter about as big as an egg, into a stewpan, set it on the fire ; 
Whea it is melted, put to it a tabiespoonfdl of flour ; stir it 
thoroughly together, and add to it two tablespoonsful of Sauce,

it simmer gentty over a slow fire for a few minutes, skim it and

QUINT-ESSENCE OF ANCHOVY. (No. 433.) 

The goodness of this preparation depends almost entirely on 
having fine mellow Fish, that have been in pickle long enough 
(i».e, about twelve months) to dissolve easily, — yet are not at 
all rustv. 

Choose those that ^re in the state they come over in, not 
such as have been put into fresh pickle, mixed with Red 
Paint,-!- which some add to improve the complexion of the Fish, 
— it has been said, that others have a trick of putting Ancho- 
vy liquor on pickled Sprats : J you will easily discover this by 
washing one of them, and tasting the flesh of it, which, in 



t " Several 8fl«ipl€8 wWeh we exumtned of this Fish Sauce, hare 
been found contaminated with Lead." —See Accvu on aduUtrations, 

t They may do very well for common .fMlates ; but to imitate the 
fine flavour of the Gorgonafish, so as to impose upon a well educa- 
ted Gourmand, still remains in the catalogue of the Sauce maker's 
desiderata.

tbe fine Aocbovy, is mellow, red, and high -flaroored, and the 
booe moist and oily. Make only as much as will sooa be 
used, the fresher it is tbe better. 

Pour leo or tweWe AocfaeWes into a mortar, and poand tbeni 
to a pulp ; — put this ioto a very clean iron or silver, or very 
well tinned saucepan, then put a tablespoonful of cold spring 
water into the mortar, shake it round, and pour it to tbe pouod- 
ed Anchovies, set them by tbe side of a slow fire, very fire- 
quently stirring them together, till they are melted, which they 
will be in the course of five minutes. — Now stir in a quarleror 
a drachm of good Cayenne pepper (No. 404,) and Jet it remain 
by tbe aide of the fire for a few minutes longer ; then, while it 
is warm, rub it through a hair sieve, with the bac^ of a wood- 
en spoon. f 

A roll of thin Lemon-peel infused with tbe Aocbovy, 
imparts a fine fresh, delicate aromatic flavour, which ia very 
grateful ; this is only recommended when you make Sauce 
for immediate use, — it will keep much better without ; if you 
wish to acidulate it, instead of water make it with artificial 
Lemon juice (No. 407*,) or add a little of Cozwelfs coocrete 
acid to it. 

06s. — The above is the proper way, to perfecdy dissolve 
Anchovy, j: and incorporate it with the water ; which, if com- 
plettfiy saturated, will continue suspended. 

To prevent the separation of Essence of uAncho!9\f^ and give 
it thehppearance ot being fully saturated with Fish, — various 
other expedients have been tried, such as dissolving the fish io 
thill Water Gruel, or Barley Water, or thickening it with Ma^ 
cilat^e, Fiour, &c. — when any of these things are added, it 
does not keep half so well as it does without them, and to pre- 
serve it they overload it with Cayenne Pepper. 

Mem. You can-not make Essence of Anchovy half so cheap 
as you can buy it. — Thirty prime Fish, weighing a pound and 
a quarter, and costing 4s. 6d, and two tablespoonsfull of water 
made me only Half a Pint of Essence, — you may commonly

Essence of Anchovy is sometimes coloured % with bole Ar-

the flavour of the sauce, and the Palate and Stomach suffer for

never be indulged by the sagacious Gourmand^ at the expense 
of these two primum mobUes of his pursuits.

of water. If you like the addflavoury add a litUe citric acidf 
or dissolve them in good Vinegar. 

N. B. This is infinitely the most convenient way of using 
Anchovy, as each guest may mix sauce for himself, and make 
It strong or weak, according to his own taste. 

It is also much more economical, as plain melted Butter (No. 
d56) serves for other purposes at table.

06s. — This is sometimes made stiffer and hotter by the ad- 
dition of a little Flour of Mustard, — a pickled Walnut, — Spice

then by banking it up on one side of the tub^ and at the same 
time by raising the tub on that side, the liquor will drain clear 
off to the other ; then take that liquor out } the mashing and

" A patent has been recently obtained at Paris, a gold medal be- 
stowed, and other honorary distinctions granted,for the discovery and^ 
practice on a large teale of preparing from potatoes a fine floor ; a 
sago, a flour equal to ground rice, and a, semolina or paste, ofwhieh 
1 lb. is equal to 1^ lb. rice, 1| lb. vermicelli, or, it is asserted, 8 Ihs. 
of raw potatoes. 

** These preparations are found valuable to mix with whealen flour 
for bread, to mtkke biscuits, pastry, pye-crusts, and for all soups, 
gruels, and pajiada. 

<< Large engagements have been made for these preparations with 
the French marine, and military and other hospitals, with the appro- 
bation of the faculty. 

'< An excellent bread, it is said, can be made of this flour, at lialf 
the cost of wheaten bread. 

'< Heat having been applied in these preparations, the articles will 
keep unchanged for years, and on board skip, to China and back ; 
rats, mice, worms, and insects do not infest or destroy this floor. 

'< Simply mixed with cold watem they are in ten minutes fit for food, 
when fire and all other resource may be wanted ; and twalve oaace» 
are sufficient for a day's sustenance, in case of necessity. 

'' The physicians and Surgeons in the Hospitals, in case of great 
debility of the stomach, have employed these preparations with ad- 
vantage.

flavour, but not a predominant one ; — their presence should bo 
rather supposed than perceived ; — they are the invisible spirit 
of good Cookery : indeed, a Cook without Spice, would be 
as much at a loss, as a Confectioner without Sugar :*-a bsppy 
mixture of them, and proportion to each other, and the other 
ingredients, is the chefcfauvre of a first rate Cook. 

The art of combining Spices, &c. which may be termed die 
Harmony &f Flavours^ no one hitherto has attempted to teach:

Cooks have heretofore given for the assistance of the Novice,

^ It is very important to those who are n^t in the oonalant 
habit of attending the markets, to know when the vwrious lee- 
sons commence for purchasing sweet herbs, &c. 

*' AU Vegetables are in ike highest state of 'perfection^ aod 
fullest of Juice and Flavour, just before they begiu to fiower; 
-—the first and last crop have neither the fine flavour, aor tke 
perfume of those which are gathered in the height of the season ; 
that is, when the greater part of the oropof each species is ripe. 
" Take care they are gathered on a dry day, by which means 
they will have a better colour when dried. Cleanse your herhs 
weUfrom dirt and dust, cut oflTthe roots^f separate the buocbes 
into smaller ones, and dry them by the heat of a stove, or in a 
Dutch oven before a common fire, in such quantities at a time, 
that the process may be speedily finished, i. e. '< KilTem qidck^ 
says a great Botanist ; — by this means, their flavour will be 
best preserved, — ihere can be no doubt of the proprietjf of 
drying herbs, &c. hastily, by the aid of artificial bear rather 
fhan by the beat of the sun. In the application of ar/iiSc/al 
heat, the only caution requisite is to avoid burning ; and of 
this, a sufficient test is alTorded by the preservation of the col- 
cur. — The common custom is, when they are perfectly dried, 
to put them in Bugs, and lay them in a dry place. But (be 
best way to preserve the flavour of aromatic plants, is to pick

eRAVIES AND SAtJCES. 303 

The two following Receipts were givea us by a tery good 
Cook ; — we have DOt proved tbem : — 

Walnuts and Buttbbnvts. 

V Make a brine of salt and water strong enougb to bear aa 
£gg, pat the Walnuts into it to soak a week, wbeu tbe water 
turns black, put them on a sieve to drain for three or four hoars, 
and then on a cloth ; when they are quite dry, put tbem into 

an unglazed stone jar. 

To make tbe Pickle, get the best white Wine Vinegar, — to 
every quart put an ounce of Black Pepper, tbe same of Mustard 

Seed, half an ounce of Ginger, and twelve Shallots. Boil it 
gently a quarter of an hour, theu pour it over the Walnuts ; 

when tliey are cold, keep them from tbe air by covering them 

with a Cork which fits close, and that with a wetted Bladder 

and a Leather. 

Gherkin's, or Cucuhb£BS, 

Fat your Gherkins into unglazed stone jars, and cover tbem 
with a brine of salt and water, strong enougb to bear an egg, 
cover tbem down for two days, then put the water away from 
tbe Gherkins, and put some boiling Vinegar over them, and do 
80 erery d&yJilLibay.tum Green, than make a pickle of fresh 
'Vinegar and spices, &c. tbe same as for Walnuts, and when 
cold,cover them close with a cork, bladder, and paper. 

N. B. Quart glass Tie-OverSf which can be corked tight, 
are tbe best vessels to keep Pickles in. 

, THE MAGAZINE OF TASTE. (No. 463.) 

This is a convenient auxiliary to the Cook. It may be ar- 
ranged as a pyramidical Epergne for a Dormant in the centre 
of tbe table, or as a Travelling Store Chest. 

The following Sketch will enable any one to fit up an assort- 
ment of flavouring materials according to their own fancy and 
palate, and, we presume, will furnish sufficient variety for the 
^ amusement of the gustatory nerves of a thorough-bred Grand 
Gourmand of tbe first magnitude, (if Cayenne and Garlick 
have not completely consumed the sensibility of his palate,) and 
consists of a Sauce Box, containing four eight*ounce bottles^ 
sixteen four-ounce, and eight two-ounce bottles :— -

THE 

COOK'S ORACLE. 



MADE DISHES, &c. 

(No. 483.) 

Recevpts for Economicd Made Dishes, written for the 
Cook's Oracle^-&^ an accomplished English Lady. 

Thsse ExperimeDts have arisen from my aversion to Cold 
Meat, and my preference of -what are termed French Dishes ; 
with which (by a certain management) I think I can furnish 
my table at far less expense — than is generally incuned in get- 
ting up a Plain Dinner. 

Gravt or Soup Meats I never buy, — and yet am seldom 
without a good provision of what is technically denominated 
Stock. 

When, as it frequently happens, we have Ham dressed, if 
the Joint be above the weight of seven pounds, I have it cut in 
half, and prepared in the following manner : — First, ensure 
that it has been properly soaked, scraped, and cleaned to a 
nicety, — then put it into an Earthen Vessel as near its own size 
as possible, with just as much water as will cover it, to which 
add four Onions, a clove of Garlick, half a dozen Shallots, a 
Bay leaf, a bunch of Sweet herbs, half a dozen Cloves, a few 
Peppercorns and Allspices this should be well closed, and 
kept simmering about three hours. It is then served with 
Raspings or with Glazing, the rind having first been taken off 
neatly. — The liquor is strained, and kept till Poultry of any 
sort, or Meat, is boiled, when the liquor in which they have 
been dressed should be added to it, and boiled down fast tilt 
reduced to about three pints : when cold, it will be a highly 
flavoured, well coloured Jelly,* and ready for Sauce for all 
kinds of Ragoixts and Hashes, &c, ka.

SIS XADE DISHSS* 

A FiLLBT OF Vkal I divide into Three Parts ; the Meat^ 
before it is skewered, will of iuelf indicate where the partilioa is 
natural, and will pull asunder as you would quarter ao Orange; 
— the Largest Piece should be stuffed with (No. 374, or 375,) 
and rolled up, compactly skewered, Sec, and makes a Tery 
pretty small FiUet — the Square Flat Piece will either cut into 
Cutlets (No. 90, or 521,) or slice for a Pie — and the Tlikk 
Piece roust be well larded and dressed as a Fricandeau — whteh 
I do in the following manner : — Put the larded Veal into a 
stewpan just big enough to contain it, with as much water as 
will cover it ; when it has simmered till delicately whir^ aad 
80 tender as to be cut with a Spoon, it must be taken out of the 
water and set apart, — and it will be ready to serve up either 
with Sorrel, Tomata, Mushrooms (No. 305, or 439,) or some 
of the above«mentioned Stock — the Fricandeau being previoQs- 
ly coloured with Glazing — if with Mushrooms, they should be 
first parboiled in Salt and Vinegar, and water, which giva 
them flavour, and keeps them good colour. 

The Sirloin of Beep IlUcewise divide into Three ParU; 
I first have it nicely honed. 

The Under part, or Fillet^ as the French call it, will dress 
(when cut into slices) excellently, either as plain Steaks (No. 
94,) Curry (No. 497) ; or, it may be larded whole, and gently 
stewed in two quarts of water (a Bay leaf, two Ooioos, tbdr 
skins roasted brown, four Cloves, Allspice, &c. &c) till tender, 
when it should be taken out, drained quite dry, and put away — 
it is then ready to be used at any time in the following manner: 
— Season and dredge it well, then put it into a stewpao in 
which a piece of Butter has been previously fried to a fine 
froth ; when the Meat is sufficiently brown, take it out, and 
throw into the pan half a dozen middle-sized Onions to do a 
fine Gold Colour; that accomplished, (during which the 
Dredger should be in constant use,) add half a pint of Stock, 
and a teaspoonful of Tarragon Vinegar (No. 396,) and let the 
Onions stew gently till nearly tender : the Beef should then be 
returned to the stewpao, and the whole suffered to simmer till 
the meat is warm through : care must be taken that the Onions 
do not break, and they should be served round the Beef with 
as much Sauce as will look graceful in the dish. The Fillet is 
likewise very good without the fried Onions ; — in that case, 
you should chop and mix up together, a Shallot, some Parsley, 



MADS DISHES. 313 

a few Capers and the Yolk of a hard Egg, and strew them 
lightly over the sarface of the Beef. 

The Fat Emd of the Strloio and Booes should be put to sim* 
mer in the liqaor, io which the Fillet was first stewed, and 
done till the Beef looks loose ; it should then be put away io^o 
a deep vessel, and the Soup strained over it, which, cooling 
with the Fat, upon the top (thereby escluding the air), will 
keep as long as may be required ; — vyhen the Soup is to be 
used, the fat must be cleared from it,^— a Carrot, Parsnip, a 
head of Celery, a Leek, and three Turnips, cleaned and scald" 
ed, should be added to it, and the whole suffered to simmer 
gently till the vegetables are quite done, when they must be 
strained from the liquor, and the Soup served up with large 
square thick pieces of toasted bread. 

Those who like a Plain BouilUf warm the Beef in the Soup, 
and serve it up with the Turnips and Carrots which bad been 
strained before from the Soup. A White Cabbage quartered, 
is no bad addition to the Garnish of the Bouilli, or to the fla- 
vour of the Soup. If it is a Dressed Bouilli, sliced Carrots 
and Button Onions should be stewed ia thijckened Stock, and 
poured over the Meat. 

A Neck of MvUen, boned, sprinkled with dried Sage, pow- 
dered fine, or (No. 378) seasoned and rolled and roasted, is 
very good. The Bones and Scrag make excellent Gravy stewed 
down, and if done very gently, the Meat is not bad eating. 
The same herbs should be put to it, as . to other Stocks, with 
the addition of a Carrot : this will make very good Mutton 
Biotb. In short, wherever there are Bones or Trimmings to 
be got out of any Meat, that is dressed in my Kitchen, they 
are made to contribute towards Soup or Gravy, or (No. 9,52. j 

Instead of roasting a Harb (which at best is but dry food,) 
slew it, if Ybttwg, Plain,-^if an CHd one. Lard it. The 
Shoulders and Legs should be taken off, and the Back cut into 
three pieces^ these, with a Bay leaf, half a dozen ShaIlots,one 
Onion pierced with four Cloves, should be laid with as much 
good vinegar as will cover them, for twenty->four hours in a 
deep dish. In the mean time, the Head, Neck, Ribs, Liver, 
Heart, 8cc. &c. should be browned in frothed Butter well sea- 
soned — add half a pound of lean Bacon cut into small pieces, 
a large bunch of Herbs, a Carrot, and a few Allspice — sim- 
mer these in a quart of water till it be reduced to about half 
the quantity, v( ben it should be strained, and those parts of

the Hare vrbi^b haTe beeo infuBad io the Yiaegar, should (with 
the whole conteots of the dish) be added to iu and steweli till 
quite doee. Those nrho like Oaions may brown half adoam, 
Btew them io part of the Gravy, aod dish them round lb 
Hare. 

When it comes from the table, sapposing some to be kd, 
the Meat shoeld be taken- from the Bones, and with a few 
Forcemeat balls, the remaies of the Gravy, and about a qa»- 
ter of a pint of Red Wine and a proportionable quantity of 
water, it will make a very pretty Soup — to those who have no 
objection to Catsup, (No. 439,) a spoonful in the origiaal Gra^ 
vy is an i mprovemeot, ^s indeed it is in every made Dish where 
the Mushroom itself 19 not at command. 

Every RagodU, in my opinion, should be dressed tbe day 
before it is wanted, that any Fat, which has escaped ibe skim- 
ming spoon, may with ease be taken off when cold. 

Calf^s Head. — Take tbe half of one, with the skin on,— 
put it into a large stewpan with as much water as will cover it, 
a knuckle of Ham, and the usual accompaniments of Onjons, 
Herbs, &c. &c, and let it simmer till the flesh may be separa- 
ted from the bone with a Spoon — do so, and while sttU hot cut 
it into as large a sieed square as tbe piece will admit of ; — the 
trimmiogs and half the liquor put by in a tureen ; to the re- 
maining half add a gill of White Wine, and reduce tbe whofe 
of that by quick boiling till it is again half consumed, when it 
should be poured over tbe large square piece in an £arthea 
Vessel surrounded with Mashrooms, white Button Onioos, 
small pieces of Pickled Pork (half an inch in-breadth, and ooe 
and half in length,) and the Tongue in Slices, and r^imoiered 
till the whole is fit to serve up ; some browned Forcemeat 
balls are a pretty addtlioD. After this comes from the TaUe, 
the remains should be cut into small pieces and mixed up with 
the trimmings and liquor, which (with a little more wine) pro* 
perly thickened, will make a very good Mock Turtle Soup for 
a future occasion."

ews, skin and gristle, Sec. — put in nothing btU what isto be e<A-

Obs.««» Select for your Hashy those parts of the joint ikat 
are least done. It is a mode of Cookery by no means suited 
to delicate stomachs, unless the Meat, &c. be considerably nn- 
der-done the first time — a second dressing must spoil it. 

To WARM HA8HBS.f (No, 485.) 

Made Dishes, — Stews, — Ragouts, — Soups, Stc. Put whajt 
you have left, into a deep hash dish, or tureen : when you 
want it, set this in a stewpan of boiling water ; let it stand, till 
the contents are quite warm. 

To Hash Beef, &c. (No. 486.) 

Put a pint and a half of Broth, — or Water, with an ounce 
of (No. 252,) or a large tablespoonful of Mushroom Catsup 
into a stewpan with the Gravy you have saved that was left 
from the Beef, and put in a quarter ounce of onion sliced Yery 



' * Hashes and Meats dressed a seconid time, should ofdy iimmer 
^entlyi tiii jutiwarm ibrough '. it is supposed they have been done 
very nearly, if not quite enough, already ; select those parts of the 
joint that have been least done. 

In making a Hash from a Leg of MiUorij do not destroy the Mar- 
row-bone to help the gravy of your hash, to which it' will make no 
perceptible addition ; but saw it in two, twist writing paper round the 
«nds, and send it up on a plate, as a side dish, garnished with sprigs 
•f parsley : — if it is a Roast leg, preserve the end bone, and send it 
up between the marrow-bones. This is a very pretty Luncheon or Sup- 
per dish. 

t The ^ain Marie or Water-Bath, see note to (No. 529,) is the 
best utensil to warm up made dishes, and things that have been al- 
ready sufficiently dressed, ^s it neither consumes the sauce, nor har- 
dens the meat ;— if you have not a Water-Bath, a Dutch Oven wiU 
sometimes supply the place of it. 

'< Bain Marie is a flat vessel containing boiling water : you put all 
your stewpans into the water, and keep that water always very hot, 
but it must not boil ; the effect of this Bain Marie is to keep every 
thin^ warm without altering either the quantity or the quality, par- 
ticularly the quality. When I had the honour of serving a Nobleman 
who kept a very extensive hunting establishment, aad the hour of 
dinner was consequently uncertain, I was in the habit of using Bain 
Marie, as a ceitain means of preserving the flavour of all my dishes. 
]f you keep your sauce or broth or soup by the fireside, the soup re- 
duces and becomes too strong, and the sauce thickens as well as re- 
ducea. This is the best way of warming Turtle, or Mock Turtle 
Soop, — as 4ih^ thick part is always at the bottom, and this method 
prevents it from burning^ aod keeps it always good."'«-UD£'s Cookery-

Cold Meat BroUedf wUh Poached Eggs, (No. 487.) 

The inside of a Sirloin of Beef is best for this dish, or a 
Leg of Mutton. Cut the slices of even and equal thickness, 
and broil and brown them carefully and slightly over a clear 
smart fire, or in a Dutch oven, give those slices most fire that' 
are least done; — lay them in a dish before the fire to keep hot, 
while you pOBCh the EggSj ttf directed ia (No. 546,) and niasb-

more relishing than nourishing, unless the Meat was under* 
done the first time it was dressed.

Take five thick Mutton Chops or two pouuds off the neck

stewpan, then a couple of Chops and .some of the Onions ; 
then again potatoes, and so on till the pan is quite full, — a small 
spoonRil of white pepper, and about one and a half of salt, 
and three gills of broth or gravy ; coverall very close in, so as 
to prevent the steam from getting out, and let them sle«r (wo 
hours oh a very slow fire. A small slice of ham is a great ad- 
dition to this dish. The Cook will be the best judge when it 
is done, as a great deal depends on the fire you have.

Harr^co^r Mutton a la Moost-Ate. (No. 489.) 

Cut the best end of a Neck or Loin of Matton that iua 
been kept till tender, into Chops of equal thickoess, one cib to 
each ; (Ub hons hommes de Boucke de Pari9^ cut two chops to 
one bone, but h is more convenient to help them when there is 
only one, two at a tine is too large a dose for Joha Bull,) tria 
off most of the Fat, and the lower end of the chine bone, and 
scrape it clean ; — ^flttten them with a cleaTer, and lay them in 
a Stewpan, with an ounce of Butter and a large Onion ; — set 
it over a smart fire : if your fire is not sharp, ibe chops will 
be done before they are coloured : the intention of fryiog tbem 
is merely to gwe ^em a brpwmng. 

While the Chops are browning, peel and boU a couple of 
dozen of young button Onions in about three pints o! water 
(qt about 15 or 30 minutes, set them by, — ^aod pour off the li- 
quor they were boiled in into the stewpan with the chops, and 
add as much boiling water as will cover them, remove the scum 
as it rises, and then put in six ounces of Carrots, and eight 
ounces of Turnips peeled and cut into slices, or shaped into 
balls about as big as a nutmeg, put in the Carrots twenty min- 
utes before the Turnip, he careful tkey'are not stewed too fast 
or too mucky — so take out one of the Chops with a fish slice, 
and try it: when they are tender, which will be in about an 
hour and a half, then pass the gravy through a sieve into a ba- 
sin, skim off the fat, aad set the meat and vegetables by the 
fire to keep hot, and pour some boiling water over the buttoa 
Onions to warm them, and then put them round the Dish, the 
last thing. 

Thicken tite Gravy by putting an ounce of Butter ioto a 
Stewpan ; when it is melted, stir in as much Flour as will 
stiffen it, pour the gravy to it by degrees, stir together till it 
boils; strain it through a fine sieve or taiamis into a stewpan, 
«nd let it simmer gently while you dish up thi^Meat and Vege- 
tables ; lay the chops round a disb, pmt the Vegetables in the 
middle, and pour the thickened gravy over. Some put in Ca- 
pers, &c. minced Gfherkins, &c.

For two pounds of Steaks, if you fear they will not eat ten-

with slices of fattish Ham, or Bacon, and on this lay the Steaks, 
(which should be nicely trimmed and shaped ;) just cover them' 
with water, a dozen corns of Allspice, the same of Black Pep- 
per, the red part of a Carrot, a little bundle of Savoury aiid 
Parsley, a large Onion with half a dozen Cloves stuck in it, 
and a head of Celery ; cover them close, and let tUem simmer 
gently about an hour aud a half, according to their thickness; 
if they are thin Steaks, an hour may be enough ; take care the 
Meat does not go to ragSy by doing toofast, or toofnuch. 

When the Steaks are tender, take them up, flour them, aud 
fry tbero, only just to brown them, in an ounce of Butter ; make 
some thickening with an ounce of Butter and two tablespoons- 
ful of Flour ; put it into your sauce ; stir it well together 
with a wooden spoon, adding thereto a tablespoonful of Claret, 
or Port wine, the same of Mushroom Catsup (No. 439,) half

— andsetabout recording these results of our own Sxperi-

to any thing like an accurate description of the way in which 
this excellent dish is actually dressed in the best Alamode Beef 
Shops ; — from whence, of course, it was impossible to obtain 
any information : — however, after all, the whole of the secret 
seems to be thickening the gravy of Beef that has been very 
slowly^ stewed, and flavouring it with Bay leaves and Allspice. 

Take about eleven pounds of the Mouse-Buttock, — or Clod 
of Beef, — or a Blade Bone, — or the Sticking piece; or the like 
weight of the Breast of Veal ; cut it into pieces of thre6 or four 
ounces each ; put two or three ounces of Beef drippings, and 
a couple of large onions, into a large deep stewpan ; as soon as 
it is quite hot, flour the meat, put it in the stewpan, keep stir^ 
ring it with a wooden spoon ; whea it has been on about ten 
minutes, dredge it with flour, and keep doing so till you have 
stirred as much as you think will thicken it, then cover it with 
boiling water, (it will take about a gallon,) adding it by degrees 
and stirring it together ; skim it when it boils, and then put in 
one drachm of ground Black Pepper, two of Allspice, and four 
Bay leaves ; set the pan by the side of the fire, or at a distance 
over it, and let it stew very slowly for about three hours; when 
you find the meat suflSciently tender, put it into a tureen, and 
it is ready for table.

SUeei of Ham or Bacon. (No. Si6.) 

Ham, or Bacon, may be yWeJ, or broiled oo agnd&roa 
over a clear fire,— or toasted with a fork ; — take care to slko 
it of the same tbickoess in every part. 

If yoa wish it curled, cot it ia slices about two inclm 
long, (if longer, the outside will be done too much, before the 
inside is done enough ;) roll it up, and put a little woodea 
skewer through it ; put it in a Cheese*toaster, or Datcfa-oreo, 
for eight or ten minutes, turning it as it gets crisp. 

This is considered the handsomest way of droasiag Bacon r 
but we like it best uncurled, — because it is crisper, and mora 
equally done. 

06s. — Slices of Ham or Bacon should not be more iban 
half a quarter of an inch thick, and will eat much more mellow 
if soaked in hot water for a quarter of an hour, «od then dnad 
in a cloth, before they are broiled, Ssc 

Relishing Rashers of Azcon. (No. 527.) 

If you haye any Cold Bacony you may make a very nice dish

grate some crust of bread, as directed for Ham, see (No. 14,) 
and powder them well with it on both sides ; lay the rashers 
in a Cheese-toaster, — they will be browned on one side ia 
about three minutes : — turn them and do the other. 

Obs, — These are a delicious..«ccompaoiment to poached, or 
fried Eggs : — The Qacon having beeiAoiledf first, is extreme- 
ly tender and mellow. — They are an excellent garnish roaod 
Veal Cutlets, or Sweet-breads, or Calfs-head Hash, or Gteep 
Pease, or Beans, &c. 

Hashed Venison, (No. 5^S.)

Gravy (No. 347,) or the bones and trinimings of the joiDt,(afler 
you have cut off all the handsome slices fou can, to make the 
hash ;) put these into some water, and stew them gently for an 
hour: then put some butter into a stewpan ; when melted, 
put to it as much flour as will dry up the butter, and stir it well 
together ; add to it, by degrees, the Gravy you have been 
making of the trimmings, and some Red Currant Jelly, give it

Just sufficiently large to well hold it; put in some sweet Herbs, 

a roll or two of rind of a Lemon, or a Seville Orange, and a 

fine large Onion with five cloves stuck in it, — and if you wish 

to preserve the flavour of the Hare, a quarter pint of water ; 

if you are for a Raga^f^ a quarter pint of Claret, or Port wine, 

and the juice of a Seville Orange, or Lemon : tie the jar down 

closely with a bladder, so that no steam can escape ; put a little 

hey in the bottom of a saucepan, in which place tbe jar, and 

pour in water till it reaches within four inches of the top of the

fVell cleansed^ see (No. 83,) Dnpping^ or Lardy is better 
than Butter to fry Eggs. 

Be sure the fryiogpan is quite clean : when the fat is hot, 
break two or three eggs into it ; do not turn them, but while 
they are frying, keep pouring some of the fat over them mxh a 
spoon: — when the Yolk just begins to look white, which it 
will in about acoupie of minutes, they are enough ;^ — ike fVhite 
must not hse Us transparency^ hvJt the Yolk be seen blushing 
through it: — if they are done nicely, they will look as white 
and delicate as if they had been poached, take them up with a 
4in slice, drain the Fat from them, trim tbem neatly, and send 
them up with the Bacon round them. 

To Poach Eggs. (No. 546.) 

The Cook who wishes to display her skill in Poaching, must 
endeavour to procure Eggs that have been laid a couple of 
days, those that are quite new laid are so milky, that take all 
nhe care you can, your cooking of them will seldom procure 
.you the praise of being a Pdme Poacher ; — lyou must have 
ifiresh Egg9> or it js equally impossi ble. 



344 HADE DISHES. 

The Beauty of a Poacbed Egg, is for the Yolk to be seen 
blushing through the White, — which should only bejustsafli- 
ctentiy hardened, to form a transpareat Veil for the £gg. 

Have some boiling water* io a Tea Kettle, — pass as uuicG' 
of it through a dear cloth as will half 6ll a^tewpan^ break ibe 
Egg into a cup, and when the water boils, remove tbestewpm 
froTD the stove, and gently slip the Egg into it ; it nraet stasd 
till the white is sel ; then pi?t it over a very moderate fire, and 
as soon as the water boils, the Egg is ready ; take it up with a 
slice, and neatly coutid off the ragged edges of the white, — 
send them up on a Toaat,+ with or without Batter ; or vfiihout 
a Toast, garnished with streaked Bacon (Nos. 5^6 or 5^7,) 
nicely fried, or as done in (No. 545,) or slices of BroWed Beef 
or Mutton (No. 487,) Anchovies (Nos. 434, and 435,) Porfc 
Sausages (No. 87,) or Spiuage (No. 322.) 

06s. — The bread should be a little larger than the Egg, and 
about a quarter of an inch thick : only just give it a yellow coF- 
our: — if you toast it brown, it will get a bitter flavour: — or 
moisten it by pouring a little hot water on it; some sprjiikle it 
with a few drops of Vinegar. 

To hoil Eggs io eat in the Shell or for Salads. (No. 547.) 

The fresher laid the better, put them into boiling water; if 
you like tho white jjjst set, J about two minutes boiling is 
enough, a new laid egg will take a liltle more : if you wish the 
yolk to be ?e\^ it will take three, and to boil it hard (or a SiL- 
AD, five minutes. See (No. 372.) 

Obs. — Ji new laid Egg \s\\\ require boiliog longer than a 

stale one, by half a minute. 

N. B. " Eg'gs may be preserved fot, twelve months, in a sweet and 
palatable stato for eating in the shell, or using for Salad*, by boiling 
theiafor one minnte-; and -when wanted for ose, let them be boiled

t " A couple of poacbedE«!^gs, with a few fine fried coltops of pare 
Bacon,, are not bad for breoikfast, or to begin a meal," says Sir K£5* 
jel;>i DiGBY, M. D. in his Closet of Cookery. 

X The lightest mode of preparing eggs for the table, is to boil them 
only as long as is necessary to coa«:iilate slightly the greater part of 
the white, withoTkt depriving the yolk oi* its fliiiJity.— Dr. FeaR80,s's

Tea.+ (No. 550.) 

« Tire Jesuit that cattle from China, A. D. 1664, told Mr. 
Walter, that to a drachm of tea they put a pint of water, and 
frequently tatce tbeyoiks of two new laid egg?, and beat them 
U|) with asntuch fine sugar as is sufficient for the tea, and sttr 
ail well together. He also informed binn, (hat we let the hot 
water remain too long soaking upon the tea, which makes it ex- 
tract into itself the earthly parts of the herb : the water most 
remain upon it bo long^han while you can say the Miserere 
psalm very leisurely ; you have then only the spiritual part of 
the tea, the proportion of which to the water must be about a 
drachm to a pint. — Sir Ken elm DiaBY*8 Cookery^ Londoo,

t VAaious Ways of Makino Txa. 

1. 
*^ The Japanese reduce their Tea to a fine powder by pounding it) 
— ^they put certain portions of this into a teacup, poor boiling water, 
upon it, and stir it up, and drink it as soon as it is cool enough.

Dubvissoh's Mahnsr of Making Tea. 

" Fut the Tea into a kettle with cold water,— cover it dose, set it on 

the fire, and make it all bat boil ; when yon see a sort of white scum 

on the surface, lake it fr«m the fire ; when the leaves sink, it is ready. 

3. 
" The night before you wish to have Tek ready for drinking, — 
pour on il as much cold i^ater as you wish to make Tea,— next morn* 
ing pour off the clear liquor, and when you ^wish to drmk it, make it 
warm,"&LC. 

The above ate from " LArt du Limonadier" de Dubuiuon^ Paris. 

QvyMldy, 
*^ A great taving may be made by mMng a tinckire of Tea^ thus,— 
pour boiling water upon it, and let it stand twenty minutes, putting 
iirto each cup no more than is necessary to fill about one>third full,— 
£31 each' onp up with hot^water from an urn or kettle, thus the Tea 
will be always hot andeqiMly strong to the end,— and one teaspoon- 
fidl will be found enough for three cups, for each person : according 
to the present mode of making it, three times the quantity is ofte» 
itted."-*See Dr. TmfsJ4KB!9 way to.be Rich and' RttputabU.

Coffee, as ased on the Conlioeat, serrea the double poifOM 
of aa agreeable toDic, aadao exhiliratiog beverage, without (bs 
ttopleasaat effects of wine. 

Coffee, aa draak io England, debilitetes the Stomach and 
produces a slight nausea. In France and in Italy it is made 
strong from the best Coffee, and b poured out hot and trans- 
parent. 

In England^it is usually made from bad Coffee, serred out 
tepid and mo4dy, and drowned in a deluge of wafer. 

To make Coffee fit for use, you must employ the Germaa 
£|ter, — pay at least As, the pound for it, and u&ke at kaal aa 
ounce for tfvobreak&st cups. 

No Cofiee will bear drinking witli^^bat is caUed mtlk ia

London people should either take their Coffee pore, or put a

06s.— JjTfAe Water ceases to hoU^ the Pudding wiU become 
heavy ^ and he spoiled; — if properly managed, this aod the foU 
lowing will be as fine Puddings of the kind as art can produce. 

Puddings are best when mixed an hour or two before ibey 
<»re boiled, as the various ingredients by that means amalga- 
mate, and the wbole becomes richer and fuller of flavour, espe- 
cially if the various ingredients be thorougiilt well stirred 
together. A tablespoonfnl of Tkbaclb will give it a rich 
brown colour. See Pudding Sauce (No* 269,) aod Pudding 
Catsup (No. 446.) 

N.B. This Pudding may be baked in an oven, or under 
Meat, same as Yorkshire Pudding (No. 552,) make it the 
same, only add half a pint of Milk more, it should be above an 
inch and a quarter in thickness, it will take full two bours, — it 
requires faithful watching, for if the lop gets burned, ao empy- 
reu malic flavour will pervade the whole of the Pudding. — ^Or 
butter some Saucers, and fill them with pudding, ^nd set tbem

hours aod a half, rub them through a sieve into a deep dish, 
adding* to them an egg or two, an ounce of butter and some 
pepper and salt; beat them well together for about ten minutes, 
when these ingredients are well incorporated together ; then 
flour the cloth well, put the pudcling in, and tie it up as tight as 
possible, and boil it an hour longer. It is as gooa with boiled 
Beef as it is with boiled Pork ; and why not with roasted 
Pork? 

Ohs, — This is a very good accompaniment to cold Pork, or 
cold Beef. > 

N. B. Stir this Pudding into two quarts of the liquor Meat 
or Poultry has been boiled in, give it a boil up, and in five 
minutes it will make excellent Extempore Pease Soup, es- 
pecially if the pudding has been boiled in the same pot, see 
(No. 218,) &c. Season it with Pea Powder (No. 458.) 

IHain Bread Pudding, (No. 556)

aod a saltspoonful of nutmeg. Break four eggs on a. plate, 
leaving out one white, beat them well, and add them to the 
pudding. Stir it all well together, and put it in a mould that 

nas been well buttered and floured, tie a cloth tight over it, and 

boil it one hour. 

Bread and Butter Pudding. (No. 557.) 

You must have a dish that will hold a quart, — wash and 
pick two ounces of currants, strew a few at the bottom of the 
'dish, cut about four layers of very thin Bread and Butter, and 
between each layer of Bread and Butter strew some currants, 
then break four eggs in a ba3in, leaving out one white, beat 
them well, and add four ounces of sugar and a drachm of nut- 
meg, stir it well together with a pint of new milk, pour.it over 
about ten minutes before you put it in the oven,— ^it will take 
three quarters of an hour to bake.

N. B. We direct the Meat to be done no more than just 
sufficiently to be eaten, — so a sick man may have plenty of 
good Broth for nothing, as by this manner of producing it the 
meat {urnishes also a good family meal. 

Obs. — This is an inoffensiYe nourishment for sick persons — and the 
•nljr Mutton Broth that should be given to convalescents, whose con- 
stitutions require replenishing with restorative aliment of easy diges- 
tion. TJse eommon way of making jt with Roots — Onions — Sweet 
Herbs, &c. &c. is too strong for weak Stomachs. Plain Broth will 
«gree wifh a delicate Stomach when the least addition of other in- 
gredients would immediateiy offend it.

too plain to be misunderstood : — the Stomach sympathizes with every 
fibre of the human frame, and no part of it can be distressed, witU- 
•ut in some degree offending the Stomach ', — ^therefore it is of the ut- 
most importance to soothe this grand Organ, by rendering every thing

06s.— -Poultry U in greatest perfection, uhen in g^eaieU 
plenty. 

The price of it varies as much as the size and quality of U, 
and the supply at market^ and the demand for it. 

It is generally dearest from March to July, and cheapest 
about September^ when. the Gam/e season comm^.nces, and the 
weather being ooldery iMovos of its being brought from more 
distant parts. 

The above ii^ormation wiU^ we trust, be very acceptable to 
Economical FamiKes, who, from hearing the very high pnce 
PouUry sometimes costs^ are deterred from ever inquiring 
about U. In tlie cheap seasons we have noted, it is sometimes 
as cheap as Butcher-meat. 

Those vsho pay the highest, do not always pay the dearest, 
price. In fact, ike Best Meat is the cheapest; and those who 
treat a tradesman liberally^ have a much better chance of being 
weU served, than those who are for ever bargainifig for the 
Market Penny. In dividing the Joints, there is always an op* 
portUnity of apportioning the Bones, Fat, Flaps, S^c. so as to 
make up a variation of much more than a penny per pound in 
most pieces ; and a Butcher mU be happy to give the turn of

. Directions for Curing and Cooking PkkUd Fish.* 

The use of FickUd Fiak, such as Mackerel, Salmoo, Shad, 
&c. is becoroiog more general tfian forinerly, and would be still 
more extenshre if the proper mode of preparing xhem for the 
table was better understood. 'Hiese fish coostitate not only a 
salutary diet, but io many cases makes a very beneficial chango 
in our food; 

Whoever will give the foftoSfiriDg directions a fair trial will 
become sensible of their vahie :— ^ 

First The fish should be' kept covesed by the pickle by 
means of a flat stone or slate,' laid on them. The oil, or ani- 
mal fat, which floats on the top of the cask, should not be re- 
moved, as it prevents the fish from rusting ; but in takiog^tbe 
fish from the barrel or keg, this oil ought to be put aside, care 
being taken not to let the fish toiieb it. Secondly — The fish 
should be washed clean, then pot to soak»in a large quantitrof 
water for eight or ten hours, with the flesh side down. The 
time of soaking may be varied to suit the palate. It must 
again be wash^ dean, pat it io soak six or eight hours ia milk, 
(if you have it) then dry it by tbe fire. TAtnC^— -Wbea dry 
lay it on tbe gridiron, with the flesh side downward* OYer prottir 
lively coats, for five minutes, or till it is moderately browoe^ 
4hen turn it with a plate, or some flat instrument llwt will not 
break the skin, and let it remain over the coals ten or fifteen 
minutes, or tilt it is cooked sufficiently. Slide it off tbe grid- 
iron into the dish, and strip off the backbone with a broad 
knife ; pat the fish, to cause the thick part of the fish to abeorb 
the fat from the belly part ; use no butter — then you will mx" 
joy all the flavour and juices of the fish. 

If a Mackerel or Shad so prepared does not relish, it must be 
more the fault of the palate, than of the food. How many ar-

ticlesy capable of beiog made into excellent dishes, are lost or 
spoiled from want of care aad skill io dressiog tfaem. 

To make a Chowder for Ten or Twelve, 

Take of sfclt Pork cut in thin slices, as much as will make 
half a pint of fat, when 4ried, which will do for two good 8ized 
cod or haddock. ^ Be careful not to burn the fat. Fi»t, put 
your fat in the pot. Secondly, cut your fish in as large pieces 
as will go into the pot ; then put a layer offish on the fat ; pep- 
per, salt) and a few cloves, then a layer of the slices of pork, 
strewed over with onions cut fine ; then a layer of sbipbread 
or hard crackers dipt in water ; then your thickening. Go on 
again with fish,;^&c. &c. as above, till your pot is nearly full, 
then put in water until yoiTcan just see it, and let it stew slow* 
]y, so as not to break the fish. After coming to a boil, it will 
be done in ^5 or 30 minutes. 

N. B. Some like potatoes out in slices, which may be in* 
' troduced between each layer. Likewise wine or cyder, as you 
fancy. 

Clam Chofwder, 

May be made in the same way, substituting a sufficient quan- 
tity of clams instead of cod, the heads or hard leathery part be- 
ing first cut off. Many prefer clam chowder, nicely cooked, 
to chowder made of cod, haddock, ^c. Tha pilgrims to Ply- 
mouth, it is said, could cook this shell fish and lobsters in near* 
]y 50 difierent ways, and even as puddings, pancakes, &c. 

Tripe. 

A celebrated epicure in the neighbourhood of Boston, sur- 
passed in giving suppers from this luscious dish. His method 
was to go to the butcher's slaughter-yard personally and select 
the best looking steer or heifer, which being knocked in the 
head, the offals were immediately emptied ; the tripe, without 
suffering to cool, was taken to his house and thoroughly scour- 
ed, and boiled the same afternoon. The tripe of old bullocks 
is not only tough, but being suffered to cool with the offal in it, 
contracts a strong rancid taste, of which it cannot afterwards be 
divested. Care also is necessary that it should boil neither too 
31* . 



3W APPENWX—50. I. 

much nor too little ; the tripe of a young steer requires not 
more than half the boiliogof a superanouated bullock or cow. 
If the entrails of pigs^ &c. used for making sausages, wero 
cleansed before cooling in the same way, much time and labour 
in endless scouring would be likewise saved, and the cootrac- 
tioo of iheir raocid taste entirely prevented. 

EeU. 

Eels always having the skin taken off by the Aahermao pre- 
vious to sale, of course the cook will only have to cut them iato 
small pieces, parboil them, fry them, and set aside to cool. 
When brought oo the table and eatea ia this stale, there la 
nothing sweeter. 

jBacon. 

Take ^ fi6e plump leg of Bacon, the smallest is the best, 
wash and scrape the outside perfectly clean, spit it alongside the 
bone, and put it down to a bright, slow fire ; cover it with pa- 
per all over ; in about ? hours a leg weighing l^lbs. will be 
done enough. Take off the rind, and send it to table. This 
rosooer of cooking a leg of JBacon is for preferable to boiling, 
as it preserves all the juices, with which a very excellent gravy 
may be made : whereas, in^tbe other case you turn them all ia- 
to pot-liquor. 

Steaks^ 

Our American fashion of cooking fine steaks is, the hearth 
being highly heated, to place the gridiron on a bed of live char- 
coal fire, the steak taken from the inside of the second or third 
cut of the rump,, tolerably thin-, to continue on the fire about 5 
minutes, turned without thrusting the fork through it and (aien 
up in j^bout S minutes after ; the time here mentioned may be 
varied according to the heat of the fire, thickness of the sieak, 
the wish to have them rare or much done, or other circumstan- 
iies. When done, taken into a heated plate, a little salt sprinkled 
over it, and a small piece of butter spread a top, and the sooner 
eaten, the better. Shakspeare^s expression, often quoted, **• If 
' it were done, when 'tis done, then 'twere well it were done 
quickly" is an excellent receipt for cooking a steak ; but a steak 
vanuot be done properly at a smalt fire, on a cold hearth, and 
with a tough piece of beef ; even the gridiron should not be 



APPENDIX— No. I. 867 

k 

cold. And it is impossible to give a good steak from beef just 
killed. See (No. 94.) 

Shreen Peas, 

Gfeeo Peas that are necessarily picked the afternoon of the 
day previous to eating, should be spread on the gceen sward, 
where the dew may fall on them during the night. But if pos- 
sible they should be picked the same day they are wanted for 
boiling, 

^ate. 

Is very good when in good season, but no 6sb so bad when 
it is otherwise : those persons that like it firm and dry, should 
have it crimped ; but those that like it tender, should have it

Scotch way of dressing Haddocks, 

A haddock is quite like a different fish in London and io 
Edinburgh, which arises chiefly from the manner in which they 
BTe treateid ; a haddock should never appear at table with its 
head and skin on. For boiling, they are all the better for ly^ 
ing a night in salt ; of course they do not take so long to boil 
without the skin, and require to be well skimmed to preserve 
the colour. — After lying in salt for a nighty if you bang them ^ 
up for a day or two, they are very good broiled and served 
with cold butter. For frying, they should be split and boned 
very carefully, and divided into convenient pieces if too large 
to luUve merely ; egg and crumb them, and fry iu a good deal 
of lard ; they resemble soles when dressed in this manner. 
There is another very delicate mode of dressing them ; you 
split the fish, rub it well with butter, and do it before the fire ia 
the Dutch-oven. 

Haddocks salted a day or two and eaten with egg sauce, are 
a very good article. Haddocks cut in fillets, fried, eat very 
fine. Or if small, very well broiled, or baked, with a pudding 
in their belly, and some good gravy.

All Fish for making Pies, whether Soles, Flounders, Her-

Maccaroni. 
See Maccaroni Pudding for the Boiling it. 

The usual mode of dressing it in this country- is by ad«linsr a white 
sauce, and Parmesan or Cheshire cheese, and^buming it; but this 
makes a dish which is proverbially unwholesome : but it . bad quahlies 
arise from the oiled and burnt cheese, and the half dressed flour and 
butter put into the white sauce. 

Maccaroni plain boiled, and some rich stock or portable soup added 
to it quite hot, will be found a delicious dish, and very wholesome. 
Or boil Maccaroni as directed in the receipt for the Pudding, and 
serve it quite hot, in a deep tureen, and let each guest add grated 
Parmesan and cold butter, or oiled butter served hot, and it is excel- 
lent ; this is the most common Italian mode of dressing it. Maccaro- 
ni, with Cream,.Sugar, and Cinnamon, or a little Varicdli added to 
the Cream, makes a very nice sweet dish. 

English way of dressing Maccaroni, 

Put a quarter of a pound of Maccaroni into a stewpan with a pint 
of Milk, or Broth, or Water ; let it boil gently till it is tender, and 
then put in an ounce of grated Cheese, a bit of butter about as big as 
a Walnut, more pr less, as your cheese is fat or poor, and a teaspoon - 
fwl of salt, mix it well together, and put it on a dish — and strew over 
it two ounces of grated Parmesan or Cheshire Cheese — and give it a 
light brown in a Dutch oven. — Or pat alt the Cheese into the Macca- 
roni, and put Bread crumbs over We top. 

Maccaroni is very .good^put into a^hick Sauce, with some shreds of 
dressed Ham, or in a Curry Sauce. ^Ribaiyl Maccaroni is host for 
these dishes and should not be done so much. 

^^Maccaroni Ptidding^ 

One of the most elegant |kparatid|N>f Maccaroni is the- Titnballc 
de Maccaroni. Simmer half apound^f Mac<;aront in plenty of wa- 
ter, and a tablespoonful of salt, tilt it- is tender ; but take care not to 
have it too soft ;Whough tender it should be firm, and the form entire- 
ly preserved, arid no part beginning' to melt, (this caution will serve 

for the preparation of all Maccaroni). Strain the water from it beat 

up five yolks and the white oC two eggs— take half a pint of the best 
cream, and the breast of a fowl, and some thin slices of Ham. Mince 
the^itreast of the fowl and the Ham — add them with from two to three 
tablespoonsful of finely grated Parmesan Cheese, and season with 
Pepper and Salt: Mix all these with the maccaroui, and put into a 
pudding mould well buttered, and then let it steam in a stewpan of 
boihng water for about an hour, and serve quite hot, with rich ffravv 
(as in Omelette); ^ ''

added to the collection of bis Cook daring a gastronomic tour through 
Europe ; it is not an uncommon mode of Preparing Maccarom on 
the continent. 

Omelettes and various ways of dressing Eggs. 

There is no dish which in this country may be considered as com- 
ing under the denomination of a Made Dish of the second order, 
which is so generally eaten, if good, as an Omelette ; and no one is 
so often badly dressed : it is a very faithful assistant in tbe construc- 
tion of a dinner. 

When you aie taken by surprise, and wish to make an appearanee 
beyond what is provided for the every day dinner, a little portable 
soup melted down, and some Zest (ISo. 255), and a few Vegetables, 
will make a good broth — a pot of the stewed veal of MoTrison*8, 
warmed up, — an Omelette, — and some Apple or Lemon Fritters, can 
all be got ready at ten minutes notice, and with the original founda- 
tion of a Leg of Mutton, or a^siece of Beef, will make up a very 
good dinner when taken by surmise in the country. 

The great merit of an Omelette is, that it should not be greasy, 
burnt, nor too much done : if too much of the whites of tbe Eggs 
are left in, no art can prevent its being hard, if it is done : to dress 
the Omelette, tbe fire should not be too hot, as it is an object to hare 
the whole substance heated, without much browning the outside. 

One of the great errors in the cooking an Omelette is that it is loo 
thin, consequently instead of feeling full and moist in the mouth, the 
substance presented is little better than a piece of fried leather : to 
get the Omelette thick is one of the great objects. With respect to 
the flavours to be introduced, these are infinite : that which is most 
common, however, i$ the best, viz. finely chopped Parsley, and Chives 
or Onions, or Eshallots — however, one made of a mixture of Tarra- 
gon, Chervil, and Parsley, is a very delicate variety ; omitting or ad- 
ding the Ouion or Chives. Of the Meat flavours, the Veal Kidney is 
the most delicate, and is the most admired by t)ur neighbours the 
(Trench : this should be cut in dice, and should be dressed (boiled^ 
before it is added ; in the same manner Ham and Anchovies, shred 
small, or Tongue, will make a very delicately flavoured dish. 

The objection to an Omelette is that it is too rich, which makes it 
advisable to eat but a small quantity. An addition of some flneif 
mashed Potatoes, about two tablespoonsful to an Omelette of six eggs, 
will much lighten it. 

Omelettes are often served with a rich gravy, but, as a general 
principle, no substance which has been fried should be served in gra- 
vy, but accompanied by it : — or what ought to eat dry and crisp, be- 
comes soddened and flat. 

In the compounding the gravy great care should be taken that the 
flavour does not overcome that of the Omelette, a thing too little at- 
tended to ; a fine gravy, with a flavouring of Sweet Herbs and On- 
ton*, we think the best : some add a few drops of Tarragon Vinegar; 
but this is to be done only with great care : gravies to Omelettes are 



appendix—No. i. 371 

in general thickened ; this should never be done with flour : Potatoe 
Starch, or Arrow Root, is the best. 

Omeletles should be fried in a small Fi^in^pan made for that pur- 
posej with a small quantity of Batter. The Omelette's great merit is 
V) be thick, so as not to taste of the outside ; therefore use only half 
the number of whites that you do yolks of Eggs ; every care mus9 
lie taken in frying, even at the risk of not having it quite set in the 
middle : an Omelette, which has so much vogue abroad, here is ia 
general a thin doubled up piece of leather, and harder than soft leath- 
er sometimes. The fact is, that as much care must be bestowed on 
the frying, as should be taken in poaching an Egg. A Salamander 
is necessary to those who will have the top brown ; but the kitchen 
Shovel may be substituted for it. 

The foUowing Receipt is the basis of all Otnelettts, of which you 
vnay make an endless variety, by taking, instead of the Parsley and 
Shallot, a portion of Sweet Herbs, or of any of the Articles enume- 
rated in the Table of Materials used for making Forcemeats, see 
(No. 373) ; or any of the Forcemeats between (Nog. 373 and 386.) 

Omelettes are called by the name of what is added to flavour them; 
a Ham or Tongue Omelette, — an Anchovy, or a Veal Kidney Ome- 
lette, &LC. : these are prepared exactly in the same way as in the first 
receipt, leaving out the Parsley and Shallot, and mincing the Ham 
or Kidney very fine kc. and adding that ia the place of them, and 
then pour over them all sorts of thickened Gravies, — Sauces, &c. 

Receipt for the common Omelette. 

Five or six Eggs will make a good sized Omelette : break them in- 
to a Basin, and beat them well with a fork ; and add a saltspoonful 
of salt *, have ready chopped two drachms of Onion, or three 
drachms of Parsley, a good clove of Eshallot minced very fine ; beat 
it well up \vith the ^ggs ; then take four ounces of Fresh Butter, 
and break half of it in little bits, and pot it into the Omelette, and the 
other half into a very clean fryingpan ; when it is melted, pour in the 
Omelette, and stir it with a spoon till it begins to set, then turn it 
up all round the edges, and when it is of a nice brown it is done :— 
the safest way to take it out, is to put a plate on the Omelette, and 
turn the pan upside down ; serve it on a hot dish ; it should never 
be done till just wanted If Maigre, grated Cheese, Shrimps, or 
Oysters. — If Oysters, boil them four minutes, and take away the 
beard and gristly part : they may either be put in whole, or cut in 
bits. 

Or, 

Take Eggs ready boiled hard, and either fry them whole, or cut 
them.in half; — when they are boiled, (they will take five minutes), 
let them lie in cold water till you want to use them ; then roll them 
lightly with your hand on a table, and they will peel without break- 
ing ; put them on a cloth to dry, and dredge them lightly with Flour j 
beat two Eggs in a basin,, dip the Eggs in, one at a time, and then

roU tbeni in fine Bread-crumbs, or in Dack (No. 378), or Veal ^toAng 
(No. 374) ; set them away ready for frying ; fry them in hot Oil or 
clarified Butter, serve them up with Mushroom Sauce, or any odier 
thickened Sauce you please ', crisp Parsley is a pretty garnish. 

Or, 

Do not boil the Egfgs till wanted : boil them ten minutes, peel them 
as above, cut them in half, put ^em on a dish, and have ready a 
Sauce made of two ounces of Butter and Flour well rubbed together 
on a plate, and put it in a stewpan with three quarter; of a pint of 
good Milk ; set it on the fire, and stir fit till it boils ; — if it is aot 
quite smooth, strain it through a sieve, chop some Parsley and a 
clove of Eshallot as fine as possible, and put it in your Sauce *. sea- 
son it with salt to your taste : a little Mace and Lemon-peeA, boiled 
with the Sauce, will improve it: — ^if you like it still richer, you 
may add a little Cream, or the yolks of two Eggs beat up with two 
tablespoonfuls of Milk, and stir it in the last thing: do not let it boil 
aAer : place the half Eggs on a dish with the yolks upward, and poqr 
the Sauce over them. 

- Or, 

Slice very thin two Onions weighing about two ounces each, pat 
them in a stewpan with three ounces of Butter, keep them covered dU 
they are just done, stir them every now and then, and when thej axe 
of a nice Brown, stir in as much Flour as wiU make them of a stiff' 
paste, then by. degrees add as much Water or Milk as trill make it the 
thickness of good Cream ; season it with Pepper and Salt to your 
taste ; have ready boiled hard four or five Eggs, — ^you may either 
shred them or cut them in halves or quarters,— then put them in the 
Sauce: when they are hot they are ready : garnish them with sippets 
of Bread. 

Or, have ready a plain Omelette, cut into bits, and put them iato 
the Sauce. 

Or, cut off a little bit of one end of the Eggs, so that they may stand 
up ; and take out the yolks whole of some of them, and cut the whites 
in half, or in quarters.

(No. 1%) Savoury Pies, Pasties, avd Patties. 

The piguancc of Pies may be reflated odHbitumf by aprink- 
ling the articles with Zest (No. 356), Curry Powder (No. 455), 
and see (No. 457 cad 459), or by covering the bottom of the 
dish with any of the Forcemeats enamerated in (Nos. 373 to 
385), and maktog it into Balls ; lay one ring of these and 
another of hard boiled Eggs, cut in half es, round the top of the 
pie ; and instead of putting in water, put strong gravy. After 
the pies are baked, pour in through a funnel any of Uie rarious 
Gravies, Sauces, &c. — Truffles, Mushrooms, Wioe, Spices, 
Pickles, &c. are also added. See also (Nos. 396 (o 40^) 

Mem. — These are dishes contrived rather to exc'ile AppelUe, 
than tq satisfy it. Putting Meat or Poultry into a Pie is cer- 
tainly the very worst way of cooking it : — it is often baked to 
rags : — and very rarely indeed does a Savoury Pie come to 
table that deserves to be introduced to the Stomach. 

(No. 13.) Pigton or Lark Pie, 

TruBs half a dozen fine large Pigeons as for stewing, season 
them with Pepper and Salt, and fill them with Veal Stuffing

bottom of the dish a Rump Steak of about a pound weight, cut 
into pieces and trimmed neatly, seasoned and beat out with a 
chopper ; on it lay the Pigeons, the Yolks of three Eggs boiled

and cover it over with Puff-paste, (No. 1), or the paste as 
directed for seasoned Pies (No. S), wash it over with Yolk of 
Egg, and ornament it with leaves of paste, and the feet of the 
Pigeons ; bake it an hour and a half in a moderate heated oven : 
before it is sent to table make an aperture in the top, and pour 
in some good Gravy quite hot. 

(No. 14.) GihUt Pie. 

Clean well, and half stew two or three sets of Goose Giblets ; 
cut the Leg in two, — the Wing and Neck into three, — and the 
Gizzard into four pieces ; preserve the liquor, and set the giblets 
by till cold, otherwise the heat of the giblets will spoil the pasta 
you cover the pie with :— then season the whole with black 
pepper and salt, and pot them into a deep dish ; cover it with 
paste as directed (No. 2), rub it over vftth yolk of Egg, orna- 
ment and bake it an hour and a half in a moderate oven ; ia

little with Flour and Butter, or Flour and Water,8eabon it with 
Pepper and Salt, and the Juice of half a Lemon, add a few 
drops of browning, strain it through a fine sieve, and when you 
take the pie from the oven, pour some of this into it through a 
funnel. Some lay in the bottom of the dish a moderately thick 
Hump Steak : — if you have any cold Game or PouUry,cutit in 
pieces, and add it to the above. 

(No. 15.) Rump Steak Pie. 

Cut three pounds of Rump Steak (that has been kept till 
tender) into pieces half as big as your hand, trim ofi^all the skin^ 
sinews, and every part which has not indisputable pretensions

half a dozen Eshallots, and mix them with half an ounce of 
Pepper and Salt mixed, strew some of the mixture at the bottom 
of the, dish, then a layer of Steak, then some more of the mix« 
ture, and so on till the dish is full ; add half a gill of Mushroom 
Catsup, and the same quantity of Gravy, or Red Wine, cover 
it as in the preceding receipt, and bake it two hours. 

N.B. Large Oysters, parboiled, bearded, and laid alternately 
with the Steaks,— their liquor reduced and substituted instead 
of the Catsup and Wine, will be a variety. 

(No. 16.) Chicken Pie, 

Parboil and then cut up neatly two Young Chickens — dry 
ihem— set them over a slow fire for a few minutes — have ready 
some Veal Stuffing or Forcemeat (No. 374 or 375), lay it at 
the bottom of the dish, and place in the Chickens upon it, and 
with it some pieces of dressed Ham ; cover it with Paste, 
(No. I). Bake it from an hour and a half to two hours — when 
sent to table add some good Gravy, well seasoned and not too 
thick. 

Duck Pie is made in like manner, only substituting the 
Duck stuffing (No. 378), instead of the Veal. 

N.B. The above may be put into. a raised French Crust 
(see No. 18), and Baked ; when done take off the top, and put 
atagout of Sweetbread to the Chicken. 

(No. 17 ) EabbU Pie.

shape (oval or round is the roost general,) till about five inches 
high, — put it on a sheet of paper, and fill it with coarse Flour 
or Bran, — roll out a covering for it about the same tfaiclness 
as the sides, — cement its sides with the Yolk of Egg,— cut the 
edges quite even, and pinch it round with the finger and thumb, 
-^yolk of* egg it over with a Paste brush, and ornament \l \il 
any way as fancy may direct, with the same kind of paste. 
Bake it of a fine brown colour, in a slow oven, and when done, 
cut out the top, remove the Flour or Bran, brush it quite cleao, 
and fill it up with a Fricassee of Chicken, Rabbit, or any other 
Entree most convenient. Send it to table with a Napkin un- 
der. 

(No. 1 9.) Raised Ham Pie. 

Soak four or 6ve hours a small Ham — wash and scrape it 
well — cutoff the Knuckle, and boil it for half an hour — then 
take it up and trim it very neatly — take off the rind and put it 
into an oval stewpan, with a pint of Madeira or Sherry, and 
enough Veal stock to cover it. L#et it stew for two hours, or till 
three parts done — take it out and set it in a cold place — then 
raise a Crust as in the foregoing receipt, large enough to re- 
ceive it — put in the Ham — and round it the Veal Forcemeat — 
cover and ornament — it will take about one hour and a half (o 
bake in a slow oven : when done take off the cover — glaze the 
top, and pour round the following sauce, viz. Take the Liquor 
the Ham was stewed in — skim it free from Fat — thicken with 
a little Flour and Butter mixed together — a few drops of 
Browning, and some Cayenne Pepper. 

P. S. The above is, I think, a good way of dressing a small 
Ham, and has a good effect cold for a Supper. 

(No. 20.) Veal and Ham Pie, 

Take two pounds of Veal Cutlet — cut them in middling 
sized pieces — ^season with pepper and a very little salt ; like- 
wise one of Raw or dressed Ham cut in slices — lay it alter-

* The goodness of a Cake or Biscuit depends mueh on its being well 
Baked ; great attention should be paid to the different degrees of heat 
of the oven — ^be sure to have it of a good sound heat at first, when, af- 
ter its being well cleaned out, may be baked such articles as required 
hot oven, after which such as are directed to be baked in a Well heat- 
ed or moderate oven, and lastly, those in a slow soaking or cool one. 
With a little care the above degrees may soon be known 

In making Butter Cai(;e«, such as (Nos. 56, 57, or 61), too much at- 
tention cannot be paid to have the Butter well creamed, for should it 
lie made too warm, it would cause the mixture to be the same, and 
when put to bake, the Fruit, Sweetmeats, &c., would in that event fall 
to tbe bottom. 

Yeoit Cakes should be welt proved before put intaith4diren, as they 
will prove bat little afterwards. ' * -• . 

In making J9wcut7^.and Cakes, where Butter is not used, the di/Ter- 
ent utensils should be kept free Arom ail kinds of Grease, or it is next 
to impossible to have good ones. 

Ill -buttering' tbe intidei of Cake moulds, the butter should be nicely 
clarified, and when nearly cold, laid on quite smooth, with a smaU 
brush kept for that purpose. < 

Sugar and Flour dMiuld be quite liry, and a drum sieve is Mcom-

of l£ggs separate ^except in very few cases), is not only useless, but a 
w aste bf time. Tney should l>e well incorporated with the other ingre* 
d ients, and in some instances they cannot be beat too jqnicb.

OBSERVATIONS ON PUDDINGS AND PIES. 

The quality of the various Articles employed in the compo- 
sitioQ of Puddings and Pies varies so much, that two puddings, 
made jexactiy according to the same receipt, will be so differ- 
ent, one would hardly suppose they were made by the same 
^)er80o,— ^od certainly not with precisely the same quantities 
of the (apparently) same ingredients. Flour fresh ground- 
pure New Milk — Fresh-laid Eggs—Fresh Butter — Fresh 
•Suet, &c. will make a very different composition, than when 
kept till each article is half spoiled. 

PlurrL Puddings^ when boiled, if hung up in a cool place ia 
the cloth tbey are boiled in, wUl keep good some monAs : 
when wanted take them out of the cloth, and put them into a 
a clean cloth, and as soon as wurmed through — they are ready. 

MsBf. — In composing these Receipts, the quantities of 
CoGHs, BunTElBt, &c. are considerably less than is ordered in oth- 
er Cookery Books ; but quite sufficient for the purpose of ma« 
%iog the Puddings light and wholesome, — we have diminished 
fhe Expense, fWitbont impoverishing the preparations, end the 
•B«iienal Epicure, will be as well pleased with them- — as the 
Rational Economist. 

Mf LK, in its genuine state; varies considerably in the quanti- 
iy of Cream it will throw up, — depending probably on the 
^material with which the Cow is fed. The Cow that gives the 
*most Milk does not always produce the most Cream, which va- 
ries fifteen or twenty per cent; ; this may be immediately and 
accurately^ascertained by the Lactometer, sold by Jones, Math- 
ematical Instrument Maker, Charing Cro99, price 2$. 6d, 

In London, the MiHc is not only subject to these variations ; 
but is generally not only akimmed, — but thinned with Ski^blue 
(water) from the Iron-Tailed Cow, (the pump.) 

London Cream, we are told, is sometimes adulterated with 
Milk, thickened with Potatoe-starch, and tinged with Turme- 
ric : this accounts for the Cockneys, on making an expedition 
into the country, being so extremely surpnsed to find the thick" 
est pitrt of the Cream — at the ITop I 

EoQs, vary considerably in size in the following Receipts, 
we mean the full-sized Hen's Egg 3 — if yoii have only PuUet*B 



403 PASTRT, &c« [Appendix, 

Eggs, use two for one. Break Eggs one by one into a basio, 
and not ail ioto the bowl together, because then, if you meet 
vritb a bad one, that will spoil all the rest : — strain tbem 
tbroQgh a sieve to take out the treddles. 

N. B. To preserve Eggs for twehe months, see N. 6. to 
(No. 547.) Snow and Small Beer — ^bave been recommeDded 
by some Economists as admirable substitutes for Eggs : — 
they will no more answer than as substitutes^for Sugar or 
Brandy. 

Flovr, according to that champion against adulteratioo, 
Mr. Accum,. varies in quality as much as any thing. 

Butter also varies much in quality. Salt BuUer may be 

washed from the Salt, and then it will make very good Pastry. 

Lard varies extremely from the time it is kept, &c. Whea 

you purchase it have the bladder cut, and ascertain that it be 

sweet and good. 

Suet. Beef is the best — then Mutton and Veal : — wben 
this is used in very hot weather, while you chop it, dredge it 
lightly with a little Flour. 

Beef-Marrow is excellent for most of the purposes /or 
which Suet is employed. 

Drippings, especially from Beef, wbeo very clean and djcb 
are frequently used for Kitchen Crusts and Pies, and for such 
purposes are a satisfactory substitute for Batter, Lard« &c. 
To clean and preserve Drippings, see (No. 83.) 

Currants, previous to putting them into tbe Pudding, 
should be plumped ; this is done by pouring some boiling wa- 
ter upon (hem ; — wash them well, and then lay tbem on a 
sieve or clotb before she 6re, and pick them clean from 
tbe stones ; — this not only makes tbem look better, but cleans- 
es them from all dirt. 

Raisins, Figs, Dried Cherries, Candied Orange and 
liEMON Peel, Citron, and Preserves of all kinds> — 
Fresh Fruits, Gooseberries, Currants, Plums, Damsons, &c. 
are added to Batter and Suet Puddings,^ or enclosed in tbe 
Crust ordered for Apple Dumplings, and make ali tbe various 
Puddings called by those names. 

Batter Puddings, must be quite smooth and free from 

lumps ; to insure this, first mix the Flour with a little Mjlk— 

and the remainder by degrees — and then the other ingredients. 

If it is a plain Pudding, put it through a hair sieve— this 

will take out all luro ps effectually. 



Jlppindix.'] PASTRT, &c. 403 

Battbr Poddinos should be tied up tight : if boiled lo a 
mould, butter it first — ^if baked^also butter the Pan. 

Be sure the water boils before you put in the Pudding—- set 
your stewpan on a trivet oyer the fire, and keep it steadily 
boiling all the time — ^if set upon the fire the Pudding often burns. 
Be scrupulously careful that your Pudding Cloth is perfectly 
sweet and clean, wash it without any Soap — ^unless very 
greasy — ^then rinse it thoroughly in clean water after. Immedi- 
ately before you use it dip it in Boiling Water, squeeze it dry, 
and dredge it with Flour. 

If your fire is very fierce, mind and stir the Puddings every 
DOW and then to keep them from sticking to the bottom of the 
saucepan ; if in a Mould tlHs care is not so much required, 
but keep plenty of water in the saucepan. 

fVhen Puddings are hailed in a chtky it should be just dip- 
pedin a basin of cold water, before you untie the Pudding Cloth, 
as that will prevent it from sticking; but when boiled in a 
Mould, if it is well buttered, they will turn out without. 
Custard or Bread Puddings require to stand &ye minutes be^ 
fore they are turned out. They should always be boiled in a 
Mould or Cups. 

Keep your Paste-board, Rolling'pin, Cutters, add Tins very 
clean — the lean dust on the Tins and Cutters, or the least 
hard paste on the Rolling-pin, will spoil the whole of your la- 
bour. 

Things used for Pastry, or Cakes, should not be used for 
any other purpose: be very careful that your Flour is dried be- 
fore the fire, before you use it, for Pufi^ Paste or Cakes * if 
damp, it will make it heavy. 

- In using Butter for Puff Paste, you should take the greatest 
care to previously work it well on the Pasteboard or Slab, to 
get out all the water and butter-milk, which very often remains 
in ; — when you have worked it well with a clean knife, dab it 
over with a soft cloth, and it is then ready to lay on your 
Pa9te : do not make your Paste over stiff before you put io^ 
your Butter. 

For those who do not understand making Puff Paste, it is 
Joy far the best way to work the Butter in at two separate times 
— divide it in half — and break the half in little bits, and cover 
your Paste all over, dredge it lightly with Flour — then fold it 
over each side and ends, roll it out quite thin, and then put in 
the rest of the Butter— fold it, and roll it again. Remember,

Those who lua Iron Ooem do not always sncoeed id bak- 
isg Puff Paste, Fruit Piee, &c.-- Puff Paste ii ohea spoiled 
by baking it after Fruit Pies^ in an iron oveo. This may bo 
easily aroided by putting two or three bricks that are quite even 
into the oven before it is first set to get hot. This will not on^ 
ly prefeot the syrup from boiling oot of the Piss — boi also pre- 
reot a very disagreeable smell in the kitchen and house— -and 
almost answer the same purpose as a brick ovea^ 

(No. 105.) College Puddings. 

Beat four Egifs, yolks sod whiles together^ in a cfixtK basio, 
with two ounces of Floor, half a Nutmeg, a little Ginger, and 
three ounces of Sogar«— pounded Loaf Sugar is best Beat ft in- 
to a smooth batter ; then add six ounces oif Soet chopped fine, 
six ot Currants well washed and picked ; mix it all well togeth- 
er—a glass of Brandy or White Wine will improve it. These 
Puddings are generally fried in. Butter or Lard ; hut they are 
much nicer baked in an oven in patty pans : twenty minutes 
will bake them — if fried, fry them till they are of a nice light 
browo, and wbeo fried, roll them in a little Flour. You maj 
add one ounce of Orange or Citron minced very fine ; when 
you bake them, add one more Egg, or two spoonfuls of Milt 
Serve them up with White Wine Sauce. 

(No. 106.) Rice Puddings Baked^'-or Bailed, 

Wash in cold water and pick very clean six ounces of Bice, 
put it in a quart stewpan three paits filled with cold water, aet 
it on the fire, let it boil five roiDotes — pour away the water, and 
put in one quart of Milk, a roll of Lemon Peel, and a bit of 
Cinnamon ; let it boil gently till the Rice is quite tender, tt will 
take at least one hour and a quarter, be careful to stir i( every 
five minutes, take It off the fire, and stir in an ounce and a . 
a half of Fresh Butter, and beat up three Eggs on a plate, a 
salt-spoonful of Nutmeg, two ounces of Sugar, put it into 
the Pudding, and stir it till quite smooth — line a pie-dh-^h big 
enough to hold'it with Puff Paste, notch it round the edge, 
put in your Pudding, and bake it three quarters of an hour : 
this will be a nice firm Pudding. 

If you like it to eat more like Custard, add one more Egg, 
and half a pint more milk;* it will be better a little thinner when

boiled ; one hoar will boil it. If you like it in little Puddings, 
butter small teacups^ aod either bake or boil them, half aa 
hour will do either ; you may vary the Puddiog by putting in 
Candied Lemon or Orange Peel, minced very fine— or dried 
Cherries,— or three ounces of Currants, — or JRaisins,— or Ap- 
ples minced fine. 

If the Puddings are baked or boiled, serve them with White 
Wine Sauce, or Butter and Sugar.

Lemon Peel and Cinnamon — stir it all well together, line a 
pie dish with thin Puff paste (No. 1 of Receipts for Pastry,) 
big enough to hold it, or Butter the Dish well, and bake it ftudf 
an hour — if boiled, it will take one, hour in a mould wdl bnt- 
tered— -three ounces of Curranto may be added. 

(No; lOaO ^^^ SnonfBoUs. 

Wash and pick half a pound of Rice very clean, put it on 
in a saucepan with plenty of water ; when it boils let it boil 
ten minutes, drain it on a sieve till it is quite dry, and then pare 
six apples, weighing two ounces and a half each. Divide the 
Rice into six parcels, in separate cloths — put one apple in each 
— ^tie it loose, and boil it one hour — ^serve it with sugar and 
butter, or wine sauce. ' 

(No. 109.) Rice Blancmange. 

Pat a teacupful of whole Rice, into the least water possible, 
till it almost bursts : then add half a pint of good Milk or thin 
Cream, and boil till it is quite a mash, stirring it the whole 
time it is on the tire, thfit it may not burn : dip a shape in cold 
water, and do not dry it, put io the rice, and let it stand until 
quite cold, when it will come easily out of the shape. This 
dish is much approved of; it is eaten with cream or custard,

it in the mould. 

(No. 110.) MoosT Ate Save-all Pudding, 

Pot aoy scraps of Bread ioto a clean saucepan, — to about a 
pouod, put a piot of Milk ; set it on the trivet till it boils, beat 
it up quite smooth, then break io three Eggs, three ounces of 
Sugar, with a little Nutmeg, Ginger, or Allspice, and stir it all 
well together. Butter a Dish big enough to ho\d it, pal \xk Vhe 
pudding, aod have ready two ounces of suet chopped very fine, 
strew it over the top of the pudding, aod bake it three quarters 
of an hour ; four ounces of Currants will make it much better. 

(No. 111.) Batter Puddingy Baked or Boiled, 

Break three £ggs in a basin with as much salt as will lie on 
a sixpence, boat them well together, aod then add four ounces 
of Flour — beat it ioto a smooth Batter, and by degrees add 
half a pint of Milk : have your saucepan ready boiling, and 
butter an earthen mould well, put the pudding in, and tie it 
tight over with a pudding cloth, and boil it one hour aad a 
quarter. Or, put it in a dish ibat you have well buttered, aud 
bake it three quarters of an hour. 

Cun^ants washed and picked clean, or Raisins stoned, are 
good io this pudding, and it is then called a Black Cap : or, 
add Loaf Sugar, and a little Nutmeg and Ginger without (be 
fruit, it is very good that way, — serve it with Wine sauce, 

(No. 1 12.) Jpple Pudding Boiled, 

Chop four ounces of Beef Suet very fine, or two ounces of 
Butter, Lard, or Dripping" — but the suet makes the best and 
lightest crust ; put it on tbe paste board, with eight ounces of 
fiour, and a saltapoonful of salt, mix it well together with your 
hands, and then put it all of a heap, and make a hole in the 
middle ; break one egg in it, stir it well together with your fin- 
ger, and by degrees ipFuse as inuch water as will make it of a 
stiff paste : — roll it out two or three times with the rolling-pin, 
and then roil it large enough to receive thirteen ounces of Ap-

pies. It will look neater if boiled in a basin, well battered, 
than when boiled in a pudding cloth well floured : boil it an 
hour and" three quarters, — but the surest way is to stew the ap- 
ples first iu a stewpan, with a wineglassful of water, and then 
one hour will boil it. Some people like it flavoured with 
Cloves and I^emon Peel, and sweeten it with two ounces of 
Sugar. 

Gooseberries, Currat^ts, and Raspberries, Ciierrif.s, 
Damsons, and various Plums and Fruits, are made into 
Puddings with the same Crust directed for. Apple Puddings. 

(No. 113.) Apple Dumplings, 

Make paste the same as for Apple Pucklin^r, divide it info 
as many pieces as you want Dumplings, pt^^ol the apples and 
core them, then roll out your paste large enough, and put in 
the apples; close it all round, and tie them in pudding cloths 
very tight, — one hour will boil them — and when you take 
them up, just dip them in cold water, and put them in a cup the 
size of the dumpling while you untie them, and thi'y will turn 
put without breaking. - 

(No. 114.) Suet Pudding or Dumplings. 

Chop six oonces of Suet very 6ne, — put it in a basin with 
six ounces of Flour, two ounces of Bread crumbs, and a tea- 
spoonful of Salt— stir it all well together ; — beat two eggs on 
a plate, add to them six tablespoonsful of milk, put it by de- 
grees into the basin, and stir it all well together ; divide it into 
six dumplings, and tie them separate, previously dredging the 
cloth lightly with flour. 

Boil them one hour. 

This is very good the next day fried. The above will make 
a good pudding, boiled in an earthenware mould, with the ad- 
dition of one more eggy a little more milk, and two ounces of 
suet. 

Boil it two hours. 

N. B. The most Economical way of making Suet Dump* 
lingSy is to boil them without a oloth in a pot with Beef— or 
Mutton — no Eggs are then wanted, and the dumplings are 
quite as light without : Roll them in Hour before you put them 
into the pot ; add six ounces of Currants, washed and picked, 
and you have Currant Pudding — or divided into six parts, 
Currant Dumplings, — a little sugar will improve them.

PICKLES. 

We are not fond of Picklcs^ — these Sponges of Vinegsr 
are often very Indigestible, especially in the crisp state in which 
tbey are most admired ; — we recommend those who hftve any 
regard for their Stomach, yet still wish fo indulge their Tongue, 
— instead of eating Pickles, which are really merely tehicles 
for taking a certain portion of Vinegar and Spice, &c. to use 
the Flawmreft Vinegarsy such as Burnet (No. 399,) Horte^ 
radish (No. 399*,) Tarragon (No. 396,) MhU (No. 397,) 
Cress (Nos. 397*, 401, 403, 406*, 453, 457,) &c. : by 
combinations of these, a relish may easily be composed, exact- 
ly in harmony with the palate of the eater. 

The Pickle made to preserve Cacumbers, &c. is generally 
so strongly impregnated with Garlick, Mustard, and Spice, 
&c. that the original flavour of the Vegetables is quite over- 
powered ; and if the eater shuts his Eyes, — his Lingual nerves 
will be puzzled to inform him whether he is munching an 
Onion or a Cucumber, &c. and nothibg can be more absurd 
than to pickle Plums, Peaches, Apricots, Currants, Grapes, &c. 

The strongest Vinegar must be used for Pickling : — ^it must 
not be boiled, (or the strength of the Vinegar and Spices will 
be evaporated.) — By parboiling the Pickles in brine, they will 
be ready in half the time tbey are when done in tb^ usual 
manner, — of soaking them in cold salt and water for six or 
eight days. — When taken out of the hot brine, let them get 
cold, and quite dry before you put them into the Pickle. — To 
assist the preservation of Pickles, a portion of salt is odded^ 
and for the same purpose, and to give flavour, — Long Pepper, 

— Black Pepper, White Pepper, — -Allspice, — Ginger, — 

Cloves, — Mace, — Garlick, — Mustard^ — Horseradisb,-^Shal- 
lOts, and Capsicum. 

The following is the best method of preparing the Pickle, 
—as cheap as any,— -and requires less care than any other 
way. 

Bruise in a mortar three or four ounces of the above logre* 
dients ; — put them into a stone jar with a quart of the strongest 
35* 



410 piCKL£$. [Appendix. 

Vin^ar, stop the jar closely with a bung, — cover that with a 
bladder aoaVed with Pickle, set it on a trivet by the side of the 
fire for three days, well sbakiog it up at least three times in the 
day.— By pounding the Spice, half the quamtity is ewmgh^ and 
the Jar being well closed, and the infusion being made vnth a 
mild heat, there is no loss by evaporation. 

To enable the articles pickled to more easily and speedily 
imbibe the flavour of the Pickle they are immersed in, previous- 
ly to pouring it on them— run a larding pin through them ia 
several places. 

This Spices, Sec commonly used, are those roebtfotted (a the 
Receipt for pickling hValnuts, which is also an exceWenl Sa- 
voury Sauce for cold meats. 

The flavour may be varied ad infinitum, by adding Celery, 
Cress Seed, or Curry Powder, (No. 455,) or by taking for the 
Liquor any ol the flavoured Vinegars, &c. we have enumera- 
ted above, and see the receipts between (Nos. 395 and 421.) 

Pickles should be kept in a dry place, in unglazed Earthen- 
ware, or Glass Jars which are preferable, as you can, without 
opening them, observe whether they want filling up : ibey 
must t>e very carefully stopped with well fiiting Bungs, and 
tied over as closely as possible with a bladder wetted with the 
Pickle ; and if to be preserved a long time, after that is dry, it 
must be dipped in Bottle Cement, see page .112. 

When tbt^ Pickles are all used, boil up the liquor wilb a Ul- 
tle fresh spice. 

To fValnut Liquor may be added a few Anchovies and 
Eshallots : let it slaMd till it is quite clear, and bottle it : thus 
you may furnish your table with an excellent savoury keeping 
sauce for Hashes, Made Dishes, Fish, &;c. at very small cost, 
see (No. 439.) 

Jo.rs should not be more th<nn three parts filled with the arti- 
cles pickled, which should be covered with Pickle at least two 
inches above their surface; — the liquor wastes, and all of the 
tirticlee pickled, that are not covered, are soon spoiled* 

When they have been done about a week, open the Jars, 
and fill them up with Pickle. 

Tie a wooden spoon, full of holes, round each jar, to take 
them out with. 

If you wish to have Gherkins, &c. very Green, this may be 
accomplished by keeping them in Vinegar, sufficiently hot, 
till they become so. 



AjppendixJ] pickles. 411 

If you vAsh CaidiflowerSj Onions^ Sfc» to be fVhiley use dia-^ 
tilled Vioegar for them. 

To entirely prevent the mischief arising from the action of 
the Acid upon the metallic utensils usually employed to pre- 
pare Pickles, the whole of the process is directed to be perform- 
ed in unglazed Stone Jars. 

N. B. The maxim of " Open your Mouth, and shut your 
Eyes,^^ cannot be better applied than to Pickles; and the only 
direction we have to record for the improvement of their com- 
plexion, is the joke of Dr. Goldsmith, — *' If their colour does 
not please you, send *em to Hammersmith,^* — *' that's the way 
to Turnham Green,^* 

(No. 116.) Ghebkins. 

Put them into (unglazed) Stone pans, cover them with a 
brine of salt and water, made with a quarter of a pound of salt 
to a quart of water, cover them down, set them on the hearth 
before the fire for two or three days till they begin to turn yel- 
low ; then put away the water, and cover them with hot Vine- 
gar, set them again before the fire, keep them hot till they be- 
come Green ; then pour off the vinegar, and cover them with a 
Pickle of fresh vinegar, &c. the same as directed in the follow- 
ing receipt for Walnuts (leaving out the shallots,) cover them 
with a bung, bladder, and leather. 

(No. 117.) Walnuts. 

Make a brine of. Salt and Water, in the proportion of a 
quarter of a pound of Salt, to a quart of Water — put the Wal- 
nuts into this to soak for a week — or if you wish to soften them 
so that they may be soon ready for eating — run a larding Pin 
through them in half a dozen places — this will aUow the 
Pickle to penetrate, and they will be much softer, and of better 
flavour, and ready much sooner than if not perforated : — put 
them into a stewpan with such brine, and give them a gentle 
simmer — put them on a sieve to drain — then lay them on a 
fish plate, and let them stand in the air till they turn black-— 
this may take a couple of days — put them into Glass, or un- 
glazed Stone Jars — fill these about three parts with the Wal- 
nuts, and fill them up with the following Pickle. 

To each quart of the strongest Vinegar put an oClnce of 
Black Pepper, same of Giuger, same of Shallots, same of Salt,

The flavouring ingredients of Indian Pickles are a com- 
pound of Curry Powder^ with a large proportion of Mustard 
and GarlicJu 

The following will be found something like the real Mango 
Pickle, especially if the Garlick be used plentifully. To each 
gallon of the strongest Vinegar put four ounces of Curry Pow- 
der (No. 455,) same of Flour of Mustard, (some rub these 
together, with half a pint of Salad Oil,) threQ of Ginger bruised 
— and two of Turmeric, half a poand (when skinned) of Shal-

Onions — Button Onions — Cauliflowers — Celery — BrocoVi — 
French Beans — Nasturtiums — Capsicums, and small green 
Melons. The latter must be slit in the middle sufficiently to 
admit a narrow spoon, with which take out all the seeds — then 
parboil the melons in a brine that will bear ao egg, dry them, 
and fill them with Mustard Seed and two Cloves of Gar lick, 
and bind the Melon round with packthread. 

Large Cucumbers may be prepared in like manner. 

Green Peaches make the best imitation of the Indian Maogo« 

The other articles are to be separately parhoi/ed (excepting 
the Capsicums) in a brine of Salt and Water strong euougl) to 
bear ao e^g — taken out and drained — and spread out and 
thoroughly dried in the sun — on a stove — or before a fire, for 
a couple of days, and then put into the Pickle. 

Any thing may be put into this Pickle^ except Red Cabbage 
and Walnuts. 

It will keep several years.

Ounce of white Pepper, one large Nutmeg^

take off the Tape, and roll the Cloth very 
hard about it again, tie it up, and hang it up

the Stakes, and fill them full of this Seafon- 
ing, and ipread it all oyer the Stakes, then 
butter as many Pieces of white Paper, as 
you have Cutlets, and wrap them up eyery 
one by themfelycs ; turn up the Edges of 
the Papers with great Care, that none of the 
MoiAure get out y therefore let the Papers 
be large enough to turn up ieyeral times at 
the Edg^e ; and, if Occafion be, Aick a Pin, 
to keep it all in ; for this Grayy is all their 
Sauce : When they are thus tight wrapp'd 
up, put them upon a Mazarine, and bake 
them i when they are enough, take them 
off the Difh they were bak'd on, and put 
them on a clean hot Difii ; do not take ofif 
the Papers, but ferve them in as they were 
bak'd : This is a yery delicious fayoury 
Difti, and done with litle Danger of fpoiling, 
if you wrap them up clofe. Many People

plump'dy take oat the faireft to put in whole, 
and pulp the reft thro' a Cullender^ and vraih 
the Stone and Skins dean with fbme of the 
Broth ; take alfb the Crumb of a fenny 
white Loaf grated, to erery Gallon ; and to 
four Gallons, you may put about two Nut- 
megs, the Weight of that in Clores and Mace, 
and the Weight of all in Cinnamon ; let all 
the Spice be finely beat and gra(;^ ; add Salt 
and Sugar to your Tafte j when the Fruit 
is plump, 'tis enough ; but juft before you 
take it from the Fire, iqueeze in the Juice 
of four or five Lemons, and throw in the Peel 
of two ; four Gallons will require a Quart 
of Claret, and a Pint of Sack, which mufi be 
pat in with the Fruit. 

To make Calves-Foot Broth. 

BOIL your Feet in as much Water as will 
make a good Jelly ; when 'tis enough, 
firain it, and fet the Liquor on the Fire again, 
with two or three Blades of Mace ; if 'tis two 
Quarts, about half a Pint of Sack, half a 
Pound of Currants, clean walh^d, and pick'd j 
when they are plump, beat up the Yolks of 
two Eggs, and mix them with a little of the 
cool Liquor ; lb thicken it with great Care, 
over a gentle Fire, put Salt and Sugar to 
your Tafte, and ftir in a Bit of Butter j a 
little before you take it off the Fire, put in 

the

the Juice and Peel of a frefh Lemon : This, 
tho* old-fafliion'd, is a pretty Supper-Difti* 

Calves-Fcet, another Way. 

BOIL two Calves-Feet, a Bit of Veal, a 
Bit of Beef, ^nd the Bottom of. a white 
Loaf ; add no Sealbning, but two or three 
]E^adcs of Mace, a fliced Nutmeg, and fome 
Salt ; have Ibme boil'd Rice to ftir in after 
you have ftrain'd it from the Bones and 
Skins ; put a boil'd Chicken in the middle, 
and Sippits in the Dilh. This is very pou- 
rifhing, and lefs ofFenfive to weak Stomachs, 
than any Soup that is made. 

To 2)refs a Cod's Head. 

V\T HEN you have wafli'd and picked it 
^ extremely clean, tie it up tight with a 
broad Filleting, that it may keep together, 
and take out as whole as ^tis poffiblc ; let 
the Liquor you boil it in, be one Pint of Vine- 
gar, and the reft Water, enough to cover it j 
put into thjs three Onions quartered, fome 
whole Pej^er, Mace, and Sweet-herbs ; and 
when it boils, throw in a Handful of Salt ; 
'tis apt to difcolour it, jf put in at firft ; 
when 'tis clean fcumm'd, and taftes well of 
the Spice, put in the Head, let it fimmer 
at leaft half an Hour ; then take it out, and 
place it on youi; Dilh, over a hot Chafing-difti

of Coals ; that it may be furc to drain very 
dry, prick the Eyes, and , other Parts of the 
Head, to let out the Liquor, and foak up all 
with a Sponge ; the Sauce muft be made ^ 
with a Pint of White-wine, almoft as much 
Water, fix or eight Anchovies, a large Onion, 
a Nutmeg, four or five Blades of Mace, fome 
whole Pepper, and a Bit of Lemon Peel and 
Horfe-radifli, if you like it ; when the An- 
chovies are diffblv'd, ftrain it, and add the 
Liver. of the Cod bruis'd, the Body of a 
Lobfter, and at leaft a Pound of extraordi- 
nary Butter ; work a little Flour with a Bit 
of the Butter, that it may mix, and be all 
of a .Colour ; let the laft thing be the Juice 
of a Lemon or Vinegar, the reft of the Lob- 
fter cut in Dice, fome Shrimps and Oifters 
fry'd and fcaldcd, and fry'd flattifli round the 
Head. 

To iSroil Chickens. 

LE T your Chickens be very fat, flit them 
down the Back, and fcalbn them with 
Salt and Pepper, lay them on a very clear 
Fire, and at a great Diftance,*and let the 
Infide lie next the Fire, that the fleftiy Side 
be not Icorch'd or difcolour'd ; when they 
are half done, you may turn them often, 
and bafte them mightily ; ftrew on fome 
Rafpings of a Frer.ch Roll ; that it ma|f^e 
crifp, it muft be finely grated j fhred Parlicy, 

and

and melted Butter, is a good and a ready 
Sauce : But I am ordered to fet down what 
follows as extraordinary ; Take a large Hand- 
ful of Sorrel, dip it in fcalding Water, then 
drain it, and have ready half a Pint of ftrong 
Broth or Gravy, a Shallot Ibred fifnall, a little 
Thyme, a Utile Parfley, a Bit of burnt Butter 
to thicJcen it, lay the Sorrel in Heaps, and 
pour the Sauce over it : Garnilh with fliced 
Lemon. 

To Stens) Wild-Fowl. 

X-T A L F roaft them, and cut them in 
•* ^ Pieces, fet them over a Chafing-difti of 
Coals, with half a Pint of Claret, as much 
good Gravy, which muft be firft boil'd and 
feafbn'd with Shallot and Spice j let it ftew in 
this Liquor, 'till 'tis high coloured and well 
mix'd, and they eat better than off the Spit. 






A good Gravy, to keep ready jot any 

Ufi- 

piURN an Ounce of Butter \\\ your Fry- \ 

ing-pan, but always take care to do it 
at fuch a Diftance from the Fire, that as * ' 
you ftrew in the Flour to the Butter, it 
may be brown, but not black ; put to it two 
Pounds of coarfc lean Beef, a Quart of Wa- 
; • , and half a Pint of \\'ine, Red or White,

two Shallots, fbme whole Pepper, Qovcs

many pickled Wallnuts, let it ftew gently

3a Roafi Pike or Mackarcl. 

nPAKE one large Pike, or four large 
-*- Mackarel, draw and wafti them clean, 
make the Seaibning of four Anchovies, a Pint 
of Oyfters, or Shrimps, Nutmegs, Cloves and 
Mace, a little Parfley, an Onion, or Shallot, 
if you like it j flired and grate all thefc very 
fraall, and mix it up with full half a Pound 
of good Butter j fill the Bellies of the Fifh 
with this Seafbning, and ftrew fbme on the 
Outfidc of them ; with flat large Skewers and 
a broad Tape, tie them on to the Spit, baftc 
it as it roafts with Claret or Butter (I prefer 
the laft) ; let your Sauce be Wine, Oifter- 
Liquor, Anchovy, Spice, Butter, and Vinegar, 
which b always to be the laft Ingredient j 
when you ftir in your Butter, take 6are you 
ftir in no more Flour than will make it mix 
well, bccaufe the Seafoning thickens it.

To Roafi a Haunch of Venifon. 

TM[ A K E up a lubftantial Fire before you 
^^ lay it down, then bafte and flour it, 
and with very fine Skewers faften a Piece of 
Veal-Gawl over the fat Part ; if that cannot 
be had, the White of an Egg, or Paper well 
butter'd will lerve. A Haunch of i a l^ounds 
weight will take ' up three full Hours to be 
well foak'd : Your Sauce muft be Gravy, 
with a great deal of Claret in it ; the faihion- 
able fweet Sauce, is Jelly of Currants made 
hot. What was formerly ufed, was a Pap- 
Sauce made of white Bread boil'd in Claret, 
with a large Stick of Cinnamon, and when 
boiPd 'till fmooth, take out the Cinnamon, 
and add Sugar. It is difficult to give general 
Rules about Roafting and Boiling, becauie 
Cooks are apt to negle£)^ a Fire, and not mind 
the Diftance, that it may neither fcorch nor 
pawl J but ias to Time, I will venture to lay, 
that, allowing a quarter of an Hour to every 
Pound of Meat, at a fteady Fire, your Ex- 
peftations ftiall hardly ever fail, from a Fowl 
to a Sirloin of the largeft Ox. And the fame 
Method may be followed in Boiling.

ftq Roaji Eels. 

SKIN and wafli the fineft large Eels 
ypu can get, cut them in three, four, or 
five Pieces, according as they arc for Size ; 
make a Scafoning of grated Nutmeg, beaten 
I?^ppcf and Salt, a little Thyme and Sage, 
a little Lemon^peel, the Crumb of white 
Bi?cad J let all thefe be finely grated and 
jhred, and ftrew'd on the Eels, ftiek them 
crofs each other on Skewers, and tie the 
Skewers to your Spit, and let them roaft 'til} 
they begin to crack, and arp white at the 
Bone ; . be fure to bafte them wpll, as they 
roaft ; melted Butter and Tuice of Lemon i$ 
the bcft Sauce, becaule the Sealpning gives 
them as good a Reliih as they can have : 
thev fry or broil, as well as fbaft, fo feafon'd. 

A S'Weet Saufe for BoiT^ Mutton, 

roery good. 

TAKE a quarter of a Pint of the Broth 
your Mutton was boird in, put to it four 
Spoonfuls of the Pickle of Gapers or Sam- 
phire, fet it on the Fire to boil j then Ihred 
a Carrot, >vhich has been firft boil'd tender, 
and four Spoonfuls of Capers or Samphire 
ifhred : put this into the Liquor ; when it 
boils, ftir in four Oupces of Butter, and fliake

a very little Flour, fwccteh it, and pour it 
over the Meat : 'Tis a grateful, tho' old- " 
fafhion'd Sauce. 

Tq make a Tajly of Beef or Mutton, as 

good as Venifon. 

BO N E a fraall Rump, or a Piece of a 
Sirloin of Beef ; or, if you like Mutton 
better, let it be a Loin or a Shoulder of Mut- 
ton,, but Beef is beft ; when . your Meat is 
boned, beat it very well with your Rolling- 
Pin, then rub ten Pounds of this Meat with 
four Ounces of Sugar, and let it lie twenty- 
four Hours, then wipe it very clean, or walh 
it off N^ith a Glafs of Claret, and feafon it 
bigh with Pepper, Nutmeg, and Salt 5 lay it 
in your Cruft, and cover fo much Meat 
with full two Pounds of Butter; put on the 
Cruft, and bake if as much as Venifon ; fet 
the Bones into the Oven, with no more Wa- 
ter than will cover them, that you may 
have a little good Gravy, to put into the 
Pafty, if it wants it when drawn. Let no 
one diflike the laying it in Sugar, 'till they 
have try'd it, for how prcpofterous an In- 
gredient foevcr it may feem in a favoury Pie, 
I muft beg Leave to afTure the Reader, that 
nothing gives fo certain a Shortnefs and 
Tcndernels to the Meat, as Sugar j and, if 
carefully waftied or' wiped off, it leaves a 
Delicacy that is equal to Venifon ; and iincc

preferres it gpod all the Year, with half the 
Qpantity of Salt we formerly uied. 

A Shrimp Pic. 

TAKE a Quart of Shrimps, clean |nck'd 
from the Shells ; if they are very fait 
in the boiling, ieafbn them only with a little 
Cloves and Mace, but if they want Salt, 
ihred two or three Anchovies very fine, and 
mix them with the Spice, and feafon the 
Shrimps ; you may make a good Cruft, bc- 
caufe they don't want much baking ; put a 
pretty deal of Butter over and under them, 
one Glafs of White- wine, and fct it in the 
Oven : Where Shrimps arc to be had, this is 
not an cxpenfivc, but a very delicious Difh. 

A Hare Pie. 

BONE the Hare, and ftircd the Meat 
fmall| take almoft the Weight in frefh

good hot or cold. 

ji foery pretty Cruft for Tarts. 

TAKE three Eggs and beat them well 
together, put to them three Spoonfuls 
of cold Water, then break in a Pound of 
Butter ; while you are working it all together,' 
let ibme Flour be ftiak'd in, and work it 
together, ftill ftrewing in more Flour, 'till 
^tis a pretty ftiff Pafte, then roul it out for 
Tarts J it keeps crifper and longer than Puff- 
Cruft for moft Ufes.

thetn with Butter : Let them be well bak'd,

Ifound of the bcft fre{h Butter you can get 5 
pound them together, and in the beating, 
add a Glafs or two of rich Canary, and half

tremely well mix'd, prefs it hard down intp

To Soufe a Turkey, in Imitation of

TA K E a fine large Turkey, drefi it 
very clean, dry^ and bone it, then tie it 
up, as you do Sturgeon j put into the Pot you 
boil it in, one Quart of White- wine, one 
Quart of Water, and one Quart of good Vi* 
negar, and a very large Handful of Salt ; 
let it boil, and icum it well, and then put in 
the Turkey ; when 'tis enough, take it out, 
and tie it tighter ; let the Liquor boil a little 
longer ; and if it wants more Vinegar or Salt, 
add it when 'tis cold j pour it upon the Tur- 
key, 'twill keep Ibme Months ; you eat it 
with Oil and Vinegar, or Sugar and Vinegar ; 
'tis more delicate thin Sturgeon, and makes a 
pretty Variety, if that is not to be had ; co- 
ver it with Fennel, when it is brought to 
the Table.

better ; cover it, and let it ftand to fcald ; 
for this Quantity beat up five Eggs, leave out

Sugar, firain this to the Bread and Milk ; 
when that'is pretty cool, grate in a little Nut-, 
meg, and mix all well j pour it into little 
wooden Difties that have been butter'd^ and 
are of a Size, tie them up in Cloths, very 
tight ; they require near an flour to boil, 
when in Difties ; be fure to flour the Cloth 
you tie over the Difli, becaufe if you would 
have your Pudding very good, you muft 
make it almoft as thin as Cuftard ; and 
in the Spring, the Addition of Juice of Spi- 
nage, makes it as good as Tanfy.

NFUSE your Currants in a Stone Pot or 
Jug, that you may keep it clofe covered 
in a Kettle of Water, to boil till they are 
tender, then pals them while they are hot 
through your Jelly-bag ; to a Pound of this 
Liquor, put a Pound of double-refin'd Sugar, 
boil'd to a thick Candy, 'till 'tis almoft Sugar 
again ; then put in your Liquor, and make 
it fcalding hot, but it muft not boil • then

haye your Cakes of, and put them into your 
Stove, with a moderate Heat, 'till they are a 
ftrong Jelly i then turn them. out upon Glals

Currants, and let the Liquor run out j 
then put to the Pulp of the Rasberrics as

not to be mix'd, therefore 'tis beft to ftrain 
them thro' a thin flrong Cloth, that you may • 
get all the Pulp, and leave only the dry Seeds 
hard prefs'd. Quinces and A pricot clea r Cakes, 
are made the fame way, only they are fcalded 
in fair Water, till tender, and not by Infu- 
fion, as this Imall liquid Fruit is«

but muft be very careful to pick your 
Fruit from the dead and maggotty ones ; whea

quor, and put the fame Quantity of Currant 
Liquor to what is left ; put the Weight in 
Sugar, and boil it up together ; put it into 
your Glaffes, to eat with Cream all the Year* 
I believe this general Rule will never fail 
you, becaufe the Perlbn who fcnt it, excels 
in Sweet-Meats j the Rasberry- Liquor that 
you take out, may be boil'd up for Syrup, 
which no Family Ihould be without ; but
