HOUSEKEEPING. 



Word of grace to woman ; word that makes her the 
earthly providence of her family, that wins gratitude and 
attachment from those at home, and a good report of 
those that are without. Success in housekeeping adds 
credit to the woman of intellect, and lustre to a woman's 
accomplishments. It is a knowledge which it is as dis- 
creditable for any woman to be without as for man not 
to know how to make a living, or how to defend himself 
when attacked. He may be ever so good an artist, ever 
so polished a gentleman ; if deficient in these pointa of 
self-preservation you set him down for a weakling, and 
his real weight in society goes for very little. So, no 
matter how talented a woman may be, or how useful in 
the church or society, if she is an indifferent house- 
keeper it is fatal to her influence a foil to her brilliancy 
ftod a blemish in her garmenta 



10 THE HOMK COOK BOOK. 

Hoiiaekoepine: ought not to be taught in classes and by 
professoT's ; though when early training is lacking they 
may be of use. It is one of those things to be imbibed 
without effort in girlhood, instead of being taken up at 
marriage and experimented on with varying certainty for 
the rest of one's natm-al life. There is no earthly reason 
why girls, from eight to eighteen, should not learn and 
practise tlie whole round of housekeeping, from the first 
beating of eggs to laying carpets and presiding at a din- 
ner party, at the same time that they go on with music, 
languages and philosophy. The lessons would be all the 
better learned if, instead of sitting down at once out of 
school hours, the girl was taught to take pride in keeping 
her room nice, or in helping about such work as canning 
fruit for the season, hanging clean curtains, or dusting 
every day. The wealthiest women of the oldest families 
in society are not above seeing to these things themselves, 
and they know how it should be done. They were bred 
to it as part of a lady's duty. But if a woman finds her- 
self ignorant or half-taught how to keep house, there is 
nothing so difficult to learn that she may not be proficient in 
in a year or two at most. An intelligent woman will suc- 
ceed in most duties at first trying. Housekeeping is an 
exact science, and works like the multiplication table if 
one only has learned it. But if one is shaky in figures 
how is he ever to keep accounts ? There is no chance 
about housekeeping. If Mrs. Smith's sitting room is 
always neat and fresh, it is becan>se she sweeps it with tea 
leaves, and sponges the carpet with ox gall, and dusts it 
with a rlamp cloth, and keeps a door mat on the porch, 
and sends the boys back every time to use it till they get Um 



HOU8KKEEPINO. 11 

habit of keeping clean. While you bang a newspn^wT 
before the what-not and throw one over the work tal'lc, 
sweep with a soft broom, putting the lyoad side of it at 
•very stroke against tlie moulding ; instead of carrying 
all the dust clean from the crevice next the wall, by one 
lengthwise sweep with the corner of the broom, you 
blow the dust off some places and give a hasty rub at 
others; pass the stove with a touch from the hearth 
brush instead of blacking it, and let the boys track in 
mud and dust enough to deface a new carpet in its first 
reason while you take it out in scolding — which was 
never known to brighten rooms yet. So, when your 
feather cake fails, though you made it precisely by the 
rule which the other day came out like bleached sponge, 
there is a very good reason for it, you did not stir it as 
much as the first time, or you beat it a little too long and 
lost the best effervescence of your soda, or your baking 
powder had been left open a few minutes at a time on 
baking days and lost strength. By practising the same 
recipe carefully, all these and other points fix themselves 
in your mind, so that success is certain. Those clever 
cooks, whose success ia so much a matter of instinct, 
observe all these points unconsciously each time, and 
lay it to luck ? There's no such word in housekeeping. 
This labour does not only mean keeping things clean, 
and having plenty to eat. It goes from the oui«ide of 
the house to the inside of the travelling-bags of those 
who leave it. The mistress must observe the outside of 
her house regularly ; on Saturday is the most convenient 
time to see if window-blinds neod washing, if the catcher 
are in repair, if the shades inside hang straight, and the

curtains drape well, if the walk, steps, and piazzas are 
neat, and the door knobs and paint in order, making a 
note of every want, and having it attended to at once. 
Dexterity with tools is very convenient to any one ajid I 
have known accomplished women who would set a pane 
of glass, put on a door knob, and hang a gate in the best 
style. One of the valued contributors to the New York 
press is a woman who reads Horace in Latin, and 
Bastiat's political economy, makes point-lace and em- 
broiders beautifully, who at the gold mines with her 
husband built the chimney to her house, and finished 
most of the interior with her own hands. A little care, 
weekly, keeps a place in that bright order that so attracts 
and welcomes one at sight. It looks as if whole people 
lived in it, with live sensibilities and intelligence. In- 
doors the same spirit is reflected. The bell-pull never is 
left for weeks after it gets loose, the gas burners are never 
suffered to leak, or grow dim; the kerosene lamps are 
large enough to give good light, and of the best pattern 
for safety, and for the eye. The stoves are the open 
"Fireside" kind — the modem version of the old Franklin 
stoves — giving the ventilation and delight of an open fire, 
burning either coal or wood, with bars and fender like a 
grate ; yet, capable of being shut up as tightly as any 
base-burning heater by two tight fitting covers that may 
be removed and put away at pleasure. The health, the 
comfort, the luxury of such an addition makes up for 
many a deficiency beside. The carpet was well-chosen 
at first in small figures and warm colours of good quality, 
whether Brussels or three-ply, and it looks well as long 
«s it lasts, and kept clean by shaking twice a year^ 



H^^^^^ HOUSEKEKPINO. 18 

HKtid straight and stretched smooth over a poft lining, 
which saves the carpot and saves noise; darned at 
the first break with wot)] matching the pattern, it will 
not be shabby in tea years. It is pleasant to have 
'hings last with the family, and grow to seem a part 
'it' it. The true sentiment of the sharp, genteel woman 
wa.s expressed by the housekeeper who " liked to 
have her carpets woar out so she could have new 
.')nei." She let !o(.l--ings to have company, and money 
o dress with ? against her husband's wish, and her only 
Iread was tliat of "settling down and having a lot ol 
liildren with no theatres, no opera, nobody to see." 
The home feeling, the attachment that giows tor the 
pleasant, enduiing objects of daily .use is one of the 
rare plants of sentiment that the housekeeper does well 
to cherish. There should be care at JGrst to have things 
agreeable and handsome as possible, that they need not 
* >e a daily eyesore, and there need be no reason for wish- 
ing them to wear out. Manufactures constantly add 
servace to trade by placing better patterns in reach of 
moderate purses. Thus, the mottled cai-pets in oak and 
brown, ash and crimson, maroon and elm-leaf yellow, 
ith borders to match, so admired in velvet and Brus- 
•Is, are found in tine three-plys and ingrain, and in the 
ui« of hemp and wool, like the old-fashion- 
c that lasts so long. A word for these new 
enetians, which is, on account of their artistic quality, 
to be overlooked, because they are so cheap. All 
.st colours and patterns of Brussels, in two shades, 
in iiKjttit li. moss or leaf designs, are afforded in this 
oarpet, which is as durable as the conscience of a house'

keeper could exact. Two rules are eDough foi the looka 
of a carpet ; choose small figures and avoid contrasts ol 
colour. Small figures, however, have different mean- 
ings to different people. As a rule, a small figure is not 
more than three inches at most, any way across. Very, 
very few rooms there are, but look better with carpeta 
of small design. Then the oil-cloth under the stove 
must match, if possible, and be bound with leather 
strips to keep the edge from getting unsightly. The 
woodbox or basket is covered with wool work or canvas, 
or applique of bright cloth on Turkish towelling, making 
a handsome bit of furniture. A scrap basket, with ap- 
plique border, and a bright lining, goes far toward keep- 
ing a room tidy. The mistress will try to have her 
rooms in keeping with the* style by a few pieces of furni- 
ture in the fashion" qf the day, a Turkish chair embroid- 
ered in wools, a straight-backed one in unbleached 
towelling and applique of crimson, blue, black and gold, 
a stand covered with velvet, or a home-made easel with 
the single good picture the house affords on it, a jar- 
diniere of titles or wickerwork in the window, or a 
bamboo lounge, things not expensive in themselves, yet 
lending a graceful air to quiet surroundings. As for 
chairs, sofas and lambrequins, artists have been insist- 
ing on chintz for the last ten years, and women have aa 
steadily bought woollen rep, which the doctors tell ua 
harbours dust, absorbs vitiated matter from the air, and 
is absolutely dangerous in disease from the coptagion it 
holds. But women of the best taste, who like to have 
their rooms pretty, will choose chintz, when they can- 
not afford silk and satin, and often when they can, foi 
It* inirinaio beauty. 



HOUSEILKEPnfa. lA 

It is of more account to have broad seats and deep 
cushions to chairs and sofas, than to have them covered 
with rich material. See that there are plenty of low seats 
in your sitting-room — for much of the furniture seen is of 
very little use for rest and ease — points essential to the 
health and comfort of women and children. If a woman 
will only start with the intention of making her house 
comfortable, she will gain all the admiration she wants. 
There are many elegant rooms in private houses, where 
there are only one or two that come up to the idea of com- 
fort Now that is a very important word, one that cannot 
be infringed on without losing health. The mistress of a 
house must see that it is ventilated from top to bottom, 
by having every window and the skylight, if there ia one, 
open at least once a day — if possible when the sun is shin- 
ing. She is responsible for the health of the household, 
and must allow no scent of decay, whether from vegetables 
or meat, barrels or refuse in the cellar, no slops anywhere 
about the premises, no mouldering food in closets, no con- 
fined bedrooms or closets with old clothes or soiled linen 
to taint the air, no dead, musty smell in any room, how- 
ever seldom used, no sickly smell escaping from rooms 
where there is illness. She must see that fires are starte<l 
as early in the fall and kept as late in the spring as the 
weakest, chilliest of her family desir.es, for these slow 
chilly days take more life, and play more mischief with 
nerves and blood than she could bear to think of, could she 
see their effects. She must look after the clothing from a 
hygienic view, to see that her children and family are 
warm enough and cool enough, so warding off many an 
attack of cramps, coughs and neuralgia. The food must 



16 THE HOME COOK BOOK. 

be of the best quality and she must know that it is. It 
pays to give an extra shilling on the half barrel for select- 
ed potatoes and apples, as they go farther and nciake more 
muscle than poor ones, and don't poison anybody. Sharp 
scrutiny of eggs, meat, butter, and milk, is a benefit to 
others as well as her own family, by raising the standard 
of provisions, besides it is a direct gain. More disease 
comes into the world in the shape of taint,ed butter and 
milk, than any one dreams of but the doctors. If she gets 
the hygienic craze about food, don't let her carry it to the 
verge of confounding things " healthful " with things un- 
eatable, for badly cooked oatmeal and graham "gems" 
are as distressing to delicate organisms as the richest 
mince pie and old cheese together. That slight sour tinge, 
which nobody noticed, in the home-made bread, that solid 
pudding, which yet was not quite rejected at dessert, are 
responsible for the bad breath of the children and the be- 
afininec of a sick headache in their eldeiu Never be sat- 
isfied with any but the nicest cooking, with variety 
enough to make your table a delight as well as a necessity. 
And don't let anybody lay it to you that you are pam- 
. pering your family, and devoting yourself to a low 
/ sphere of action. You are doing no such thing, but are 
giving them strong, active bodies, steady nerves and tem- 
pers, and clear brains to meet their work with. By just 
so much as you neglect your part of the work, they will 
fail in theirs. You are the engineer to feed the fires, and 
keep the wheels oiled, and the whole family system 
depends on 3'ou. Don't dare to call such work low. 
There js_a«great work to be done in Canadian kitchens. 
You may and ought to delegate as much to hired helpers 



HODSEKEEPINQ. 17 

as you can, bnt you must see that all is done as it should 
be. And one receipt for training service is given, that is 
the whole secret in a nut-shel!. If child or servant leaves 
anything undone, or ill-done, don't scold, but insist on 
having it done immediately as it ought to be. Put the 
badly ironed shirts in the basket to be done over, have 
Uie house-girl who left the china badly washed, take it 
out of the closet and do it right, time after time, and lot 
her get tired of doing her work over, before you get tin^l 
of telling /iier. It is no harder to do work nicely tluiM 
to half do it, indeed the careless way is the hardest. 
Finally, let your housekeeping be as liberal as you can. 
Wliether well-to-do, or iu narrow circumstances, you will 
hold that waste is a sin, against yourself and the world. 
By keeping strict account of every Ct-nt received and paid 
out, you can gauge your means, laying V)y what is proper, 
but within that limit be good to yourself and yours. Make 
the most of your money. It was no less a divine than 
the ortho-.Jox Doctor John Hnll, who said that, of thu 
two faults, he liad far rather see people extravagant 
tliaii J. nurious. Stint nowhere in cleanliness, light, and 
vvarmtli, and let what you have be the best and prettiest 
for the cost By these things men live, in body at least, 
and the soul is very dependent on its surrou ridings, or 
at any mte greatly assisted by fayourable ones. It is an 
every-day wonder to see how little rich people get for their 
money ; the common-place houses, with so little that is 
light or striking or original in them, the dull service, the 
narrow round of enjoyments. In some sense housekeep- 
ing is making the most of life, bringing taste and variety 
into it, comp" ' *^ ••'- • ' v 'b. invention. Those

who disdain it lower themselves. Never think that any. 
thing is too good for you or yours that you can obtain. 
Everywhere there are people living in small common ways 
because they are absolutely afraid of the expense or the 
notice which a pleasanter life would bring. Half the 
niceities of life involve only care to secure them, without 
a dollar of expense. Good manners cost nothing, good 
taste is saving, and good housekeeping actually makes 
money. Though this book is an aid to the ambitious 
housekeeper in one direction only, that is, on the way to 
all the rest. People grow refined first in their eating. 
How is it, that the most brilliant and cleverest nation in 
the world has also the best cooking ? Put these things 
together, and do your best aco'^rdinp to their resuli 



TABLE TALK, 



In all attempts at refinement — one cardinal point 
should be kept in view — that manners were made for 
men, not men for manners. Nice customs, courtesy to 
great kings, and the greatest of these is convenience. 
Most rules will be found to serve convenience, and there 
is no good breeding where etiquette is not observed for 
this end, the order and comfort of all concerned, not for 
the sake of defining one's social position. When any 
one begins to study manners as a set of arbitrary rules to 
be followed, because every other desirable acquaintance 
does the same, politenass breeds a sort of phariBaism 
that the best bred persons look down en as supremsl^ 
vulgar. If any mistress of a house looks here for rules, 
that will aid her to afiect a trifle mo/e of stylo than her 
neighbours, she will only be disappointed. If any 
woman wishes hints how to reduce her household to 
regulanty, and make her children neat and gentle in 
habits, it may be that she will not find this chapter in 
vain. 

Hartinet regularity as to hours and minutes ia no 
longer held the saving virtue in a household. The rule

for dinner parties takes the sensible course of sitting 
down to table when the hour comes, and the principal 
part of those expected. No guest should feel affronted, 
if he is late, and finds the party at dinner, provided the 
indispensable care has been shown to keep his portion 
warm over dishes of hot water, by which they neither 
grow cold or are dried up in the oven. Order the table 
daily with the same care as for a dinner party. This 
is the only way to insure success for hostess and ser- 
vants, when one does come off, and gives mistress and 
waiter the luxury of getting used to nice style, so that 
it is just as easy as common ways, and no sudden vis- 
itor can put them out. Home tables do not always 
compare to advantage with those at the restaurant or 
club, and the housemother should see that a man finds 
as careful service at home as he does anywhere el^e. 
Unlimited laundry work should be one of the indul- 
gences of one's own house, and it should be of the ut- 
most"- nicety. Why should it be too much to provide 
clean napkins and table-cloth daily at home as well as 
at a hotel ? They would cost half an hour's extra work 
a day, and this is not too much for the refinement it 
gives. We should then expect to see the table spread 
with a snowy cloth, less starched than many house- 
keepers think necessary, finish and pliancy given by 
plenty of wax in the starch, which will keep it clean the 
longer. It should fall below the table half a yard all 
round, and be pirmed up at the corners to keep it froii? 
the floor if necessary. For ceremonious occasions, a 
common white cloth is laid under the table-cloth to 
protect a handsome table keeps the upper cloth from

weariog, and because dishes make less noise When set 
down on it. 

For breakfaHt, the coffee is set before the mistress, the 
cups and spoons ranged in their saucers iu front of it, in 
two rows if there arc many of them ; the meat and 
plates, which should be warm, before the master ; salt, 
butter and castor at the corner to the right of both, 
head and foot, if the table is a large one, when two seta 
of these things will be convenient. Otherwise put them 
in the centre with the dishes in regular order around 
them, and relishes at the comers. To meet this order, 
it is a trifle to have dishes in pairs of the same size, and 
us J them always together for different things. Fruit, 
whether berries, baked apples, or pears, is sei-ved fii-st 
at breakfast, then oatmeal or wheaten grits, now found 
on every good table in cities at least, then meats and 
vegetables, with toast, hot cakes and coffee following. 
Hot rolls come wrapped in a napkin to keep them warm, 
griddle-cakes between two hot plates, and all meata 
covered. Baked potatoes are scrubbed with a manilla 
brush, the ends cut ofl, rinsed twice, and eaten without 
paling, as the best flavour goes with the skin. This is 
the custom with the best society in this country and 
abroad. Eggs are washed with a cloth in cold water 
before boiling, and eaten in e^^g cups from the shell, 
chipping the small end off, or broken into larger glasses, 
or hehl in the napkin and eaten from the shell with 
entire good form, in either method. Where individual 
salt-cellars are used they should be emptied after each 
meal, and the salt thrown away, that one person may 
not use it after an"th''r mi rh.-v sh-nil.! h,- v«'ry small,

that there be less wasted. Butter should be piled round 
a lump of ice in little pats. To be very nice, as many 
have learned to like it from living abroad, it should be 
churned daily from perfectly sweet cream, worked with- 
out being touched by the hands or with water, and with- 
out a particle of salt. Thus it has the delicate flavour 
of cream at its best. Honey is especially a breakfast 
delicacy, and so is maple syrup, which should be served 
in small saucers to be eaten with hot biscuit. A basket 
of crisp cakes, toasted rusk and cjuekers, will accom- 
pany coffee. 

For lunch, the coloured table cloths may be used, if 
ever, though their use is gradually dropped because the 
colours do not wash well. White cloths, with striped 
border, in colours, or fine gray or unbleached damask, 
with napkins to match, assist the easy half -dress style 
of this repast. Cups of broth and thick chocolate, with 
light meats, hashes, croquettes, and stews. Salad and 
fruit are the staple variety, and rather more attractive 
than the cold meat, tea and cracker fare tob often »et 
apart for this hurried moal. Nowhere is negligence 
more annoying than at luncheon, and the cloth, glasses, 
and arrangements should be fastidiously neat to do 
away with the disagreeable feeling that everybod}' is too 
busy with drudgery to look after comfort. Insist that 
the girl who waits on the table has her hair neat, her 
hands washed, and a clean apron and collar on. An 
unkempt servant will spoil the best dinner appetite was 
ever sharp-set for. Ceremonious lunches mean an 
hour's visit with a meal, at which salads, shell-fish, 
chops, in paper frills, and broiled chicken play a part, 
with ices, tarts, and fancy cakes for dessert. Mixed 



TABLK TALK. SI 

dnuics, like Re^^ent's punch, or claret sup, with ale and 
beer, are more in keepin<^ at lunch than winea. These 
drinks are served from the side-board, the malt liquors 
in common goblets, the claret sup in tumblere, the 
punch in small cups. Beef tea is taken from cups held 
in small saucers, or in small Chinese bowls, with little 
saucers. The absence of all ceremony with the presence 
of light charming detail makes the luncheon attractive. 
For dinner, the family table wants to have less the air 
of hotel arrangements. More delicate napery and ware 
whether the latter is only " seconds, " or the finest egg- 
shell china ; lighter, more covenient, knives and forks, 
and heavier teaspoons, nice thin glass for drinking, 
thick cut crystal for sweets, with, above all things, a well- 
kept cruet stand, make the difference in favor •f home 
taste and home comfort. Keep all cracked and nicked 
ware from the table. Buy nothing that cannot be 
replaced without regret, but let each article be the best 
of its material. There is choice in the quality of stone 
ware and blown glass as well as in the shapes of each. 
The plainest is always most satisfactory of inexpensive 
things. The old fashion of furnishing dining-rooms in 
dark and heavy styles is reversed. The room is light, 
cheerful, warm in colour, the chairs broad and substiin- 
tial, the table lower than it used to be, two points which 
add sensibly to the comfort of those who use tliemb 
Have the chair feet shod with rubber tips which come 
for the purpose, or if on caators, cover the wheel with 
rubber so that they can move without noise. See that 
the room is light and e~si)ecially warm, for people want 
comfort at meals of all times, and they feel the oold 
more in sitting.

DINNER ETIQUETTE. 



Directions for a ceremonious dinner nutuially include 
those for the family table, as much form in serving 
being kept as may be convenient. The number of guests 
for a state dinner rarely exceeds twelve. 

Written invitations are always complimentary and in 
finer style than any other for small parties, but persona 
who entertain often, have engi-aved pards with blanks 
left for the name of guest, and date, for convenience. 
The following is a form adopted for dinner cards, a 
large, nearly square form being used : 

Mb. and Mrs. 

Bequest the pleasure of 

' ; Company (name.) 

. d*te and Na 



o'clock. 



The favour of an answer is requested, 
(or) B. 8. V. P. 

For a gentleman's party the host's name alone 
appears on the invitation. An early answer must be 
i*3nt in all case^, either to accept or decline. Not to do 
BO is the grossest rudeue&si. 



DIKNER ETIQUETTE. 25 

Invitations are always sent to persons in the same 

town by private messenger. Outside envelopes are 

neceasary only when sent by mail to another city. No 

articular excuse need be sent. It is enough to say " Mr 

nd Mrs. regret that they are unable to accept 

Mr. and Afrs. kind invitation for the date 

named." When the dinner is to meet any "Yjarticular 

guest or distinguished person, it is made known by tha 

words, " To meet So-and-So," dt the head of the invi- 

ition, or after the name of the invited person beforn 

he date. 

Written invitations ai-e on note sheets of mili -finished 

paper with side fold, the fancy, rough, and the highly 

glazed papers of eccentric shapes and fold being out of 

ise. The large envelope, nearly square, allows the 

iieet to be doubled once to fit Cards have the same 

inish, neither du41 nor highly polished. The cipher of 

utials entwined is preferred to the monogram, and 

occupies the corner of the note sheet. 

Guests arrive at any time during the half liour before 

dinner, and, after leaving wraps in the liressing-room, 

are met by the host and hostess at the door of the drawing 

room. Introductions follow if the guest Is a stranger. If 

he party is given in honour of any distinguished person, 

■■>v favourite visitor, the other gu&sts are brought up to 

im or her and presented. It is an uinen of success for 

er evening if the hostess can make conversation general 

' re dinner. To this end, have some novelty at hand,

a pretty girl to bring forward. Whatever the attraction 
bring it on at once, to prevent that very stupid half-hour. 
At the hour, the servant comes in and tells the hostess 
dinner is served. The arranging of the guests has all 
been considered beforehand. If she wishes people to 
think her dinner a pleasant one, the hostess will see that 
the likings of her guests are consulted in pairing off for 
the table. Host and hostess intimate to the gentlemen 
whom they are to escort. " Mr. Lance, will you be kind 
enough to take Miss Dart in to dinner. Mr. Curtis, be 
so good as to see Mrs. Vane. Jermingham, I know you'd 
prefer Miss Olney, she's such a good listener. Mr. King, 
if you want to finish telling that story to Mrs. Capron, 
suppose you give her your arm, " and so on. If the guest 
to be honoured is a lady, the host offers her his arm and 
goes out first, the hostess last. If a gentleman, he escorts 
the hostess, and the host follows the company. Before 
dinner is announced, after the guests have anived, the 
host has the names of each person written on a card and 
laid on the plates at the place where he or she is to sit. 
This does away with that awkward moment when the 
guests are in the dinning room "waiting to be told their 
places. The method long used at public dinners is now 
adopted for private ones in the best circles. 

The standard size for dinner tables is four and-a-half 
feet wide, by any length desired. Round tables for gen- 
tlemen's dinners, where all are wanted in the conversa- 
tion are made seven feet across. Dining chairs should 
have cushioned seats covered with fine leather, but no 
arms, or very low ones, that will not impede the flow of 
ladies' dresses. People who make a study of entertain- 



DINNER ETIQUETn. 2? 

ing are particular on such points. Each gentleman 
otFera his right arm to the lady he takes to dinner and 
^eata her on his left, which gives occasion for a pretty 

iece of attention on his paH. On reaching their places, 
he draws out her chair for her, and as her hand leaves 
his arm he takes the tips of her fingers and hands her 
to her seat, relinquishing his touch with a slight bow or 
glance of acknowledgment. Of course, the honoured 
guest, if a lady, takes the right hand of the host ; if a 
gentleman, he is at the right of the hostess. 

Small can-shaped pit^hei-s of engraved crystal, holding 
about a quart, are placed with ice water between each pair 
of guests. The napkins are folded flat, with a thick piece 
of bread on each, a cruet-stand and silver salt cellar is at 
comer, and a silver butter dish at each end. The 
. individual salt cellars and butter plates, have an 
lir of hotel arrangements which it is desirable to avoid at 
home dinners, though entirely admissable and convenient 
at breakfast. If wax lights are used, there should bo as 
many candles as guests, according to the old rule. These 
are in branches held by Sevres and Dresden figures, 
above the heads of the guests. Nor are wax lights by any 
means the extravagance they seem. Dinner napkins 
are from three-quarters to seven-eighths of a yard square 
and should match the cloth, for which Greek, Moresque, 
ind Celtic filigrees and diaper patterns are prefeiTed to 

arge arabesques and fruit pieces. French napkins of 

~ ^"'" rod damask, with crimson figures of lobster and 

voven in the centre, are sometimes used at first, 

'\iid removed with the fish. Decorations must be choice, 

and used with discretion. Flowers should be fine but 



28 THE HOME COOK BOOK. 

few, for cultivated senses find their odor does not mingle 
pleasantly with that of food. All ai-tificial contrivances, 
like epcrgnes and show-pieces, tin gutters lined with 
moss and filled with flowers for the edges of a table, or 
mirror plates to reflect baskets of blossoms, are banished 
by the latest and best taste. The finest fruit grouped in 
the centre of the table, set off with leaves, the garnished 
dishes; the lustre of glass and silver, and the colours of 
delicately painted china, need no improvement as a 
picture. A low silver basket of flowers at the sides, and 
a crystal bouquet holder with a delicate blossom and 
leaf, sparingly introduced, are all that is allowed for 
ornament's sake. Large dinner services of one pattern 
are no longer chosen. The meats and large dishes are 
in silver or electroplate ware, the sweets come in heavy 
English cut crystal, and each course brings with it plates 
of a different ware. 

The order of wines is sometimes perplexing, and the 
novice should remember that Chablis or Sauterne comes 
with the small oysters before soup, and that Sherry is 
drank after soup. Claret may be taken by those who 
prefer it during a whole dinner with entire propriety. 
Champagne comes with the roast, and Burgundy with 
game. The French and Germans reserve champagne 
for a dessert wine, but we drink it with both roast and 
dessert. After dessert comes coffee, isrhich should be 
served, however, in the drawing-room. FingerbowLs 
with warm water are placed on the napkin on the dessert 
plate, and removed by the guest to the left, to be used 
oy dipping the fingers in lightly and drying them on tlie 
Doily. When the ladies are quite through with dessert 



DINNER ETIQUETTK. 29 

the hostess catches the eye of each or laisea her gloved 
haD(l slightly, as a signal, and they leave the table, the 
oldest lady going first, the youngest last, followed by the 
hostess — the youngest gentleman, or the one nearest the 
door, taking it on himself to hold the door open. After 
half an hour a guest h at liberty to withdraw, but a 
dinner party i-aiely breaks up till half past ten or later, 
if cards and dancing follow. 

As to the individual etiquette of the table, on seating 
iiimself a guest draws off his gloves, and lays them in his 
lap under the napkin, which should be spread lightly not 
tucked in the dress. The raw oysters are eateu with a 
fork ; the soup, only a ladleful to each plate, is sipped 
from the side of the spoon, without noise, or tilting the 
plate. The head should never stoop toward the plate or 
cup, but the shoulders kept straight and the food lifted 
to the mouth, the head bent naturally a little. A quiet 
celerity in eating is preferable to the majestic deliberation 
which many people consider genteel. Bread should be 
broken, never cut at table, and should be eaten morsel 
by morsel, not crumbled into soup or gravy. Food 
should not be mixed on the plate. Sweet corn is brought 
on, tied in its husk by a strip of leaf, and should be 
eaten from the cob, breaking the ear in two, and holdintj: 
the piece in the left hand. Asparagus should not bo 
touched with the fingers, but the tender part cut up, 
and eaten with the fork. Fish is eateu with the fork, 
ftBsisted by a piece of bread in the left hand. Macca- 
roni is cut and taken with the fork, unless served witli 
the tomatoes, when a teaspoon is allowed, as with green 
peas, and stewed tomatoes alone. Cheese is crumbled 



30 THE HOME COOK BOOt 

with the fork and eaten with it, never touched by the 
fingers. Pastry should be broken by the fork without 
tiae aid of a knife. Game and chicken are cut up, nevei 
ifjicked with the fingers, unless in the indulgence of a 
family dinner, when the bone may be held in one hand 
and eaten. Pears axe held by the stem to be pared 
and then cut and eaten like apples, beginning to remove 
the skin at the blossom end. Oranges are held on a 
fork while peeled and divided without breaking the skin. 
Cherries in pie, or natural, should have the stones 
passed to the napkin held at the lips and returned to 
the plate, and grape seeds and skins are disposed of in 
the same way. Salt is left on the edge of the plate, not 
on the table. Ladies take but a single glass of any wine 
at most, having their glasses half -filled with champagne 
a second time. It is beginning to be the custom to take 
soft bread as well as ice-cream with cake. Cocoanut 
pudding looks like pie, but is helped and eaten with a 
spoon. Small meringues are best eaten with a spoon, 
though the practice is to take them in the fingers. 



SOCIAL OBSERVANCES. 



'VUtf simplest society duty is, that of making calls. A 
new <U)mer should return each call within two weeka 
afier iv. is made. After this, a call once in six months 
or a year, serves to keep up acquaintance. Calls are 
due to a hostess two days after a dinner party, and two 
days after a ball, and a week after a small party, though 
these are amply fultilled by leaving one's card in the 
ea.se of a gentleman, a personal call being polite from a 
lady who has more time. 

In town, leaving a card with the comer bent signifies 
that it was left by its owner in person, not sent by a 
servant. Bending the edges of a card, means that the 
visit was designed for the young ladies of the house, as 
well as the mistress of it. If there is a visitor with the 
family whom you wished to see, a separate card should 
be left for that person, naming him or her to th« ser- 
vant. A card should also be left for the host, if the call 
was designed as a family matter, but more than three 
are not left at one house. 

Visits of condolence are paid within a week after the 
funeral, and are as well expressed by leaving a card and 
kind inquiries of the servant. This is the only proper 
ibing to do in case of sickness, beside asking if one can 



/ 



82 THE HOME COOK BOOK. 

be of use. Visita of congratulation are paid in person. 
After the birth of a child, cards and inquiries are left 
at the door, when the lady is able to receive her friends, 
she sends her card in return " with thanks for kind in- 
quiries," after which calls are made on her in person. 

Bending the corners of the cards to signify "condo- 
lence," "felicitation," "to take leave," etc., is not used 
80 much as a penciled word or two, to express one's 
" kind inquiries," if there is trouble in the bouse, or 
" best wishes," if there is a wedding, or engagement. 

The P. P. C. card when one is going away, is a con- 
venient w^y of letting friends know of your absence, the 
initials of " pour prendre cong6" being often relinquislied 
for the plain English " to take leave. " On returning, 
cards are sent to all the friends one wishes to see, with 
one's address, and receiving day, when one day of the 
week is set apart for company. 

From three to six are proper calling hours, and a 
visit may be from five minutes to half an hour, never 
longer, unless with a very intimate friend. A gentle- 
man leaves his umbrella in the hall, but carries hat 
and cane with him, keeping the former in his left hand, 
never venturing to lay it on table or rack, unless in- 
vited to do so by the lady of the house. Her not doing 
so is a sign that it is not convenient for her to prolong 
his call. 

A soft hat is tolerated, but the dress hat is usually 
carried. 

The lady of the house rises to receive any guest, un- 
less it be a very young one, and gives her hand. After 
the visit, she receives a gentleman's bow, and if disposed 



SOCIAL OBSERVANCES. 83 

to be very polite, walks with him to the door of the room. 
She sees a lady visitor to the street door, if the parlotir 
is on the same floor. If not, going to the head of the 
stairs is sufficient courtesy except to elderly guests. A 
gentleman must escort a lady who makes him a busi- 
ness call to the outer door, and to her carriage, if she 
has one. A caller should take leave as soon as possible 
on the arrival of another visitor, unless asked to stay 
Where a lady has a large acquaintance, it is most eon- 
aient for her to set apart a day for receiving their 
Is, of which she admonishes them by her visiting card 
on which the day of the week is pencilled. 

Unless specially invited otherwise, her friends will 
confine their visits to that day of the week. 

To these afternoons the hostess appears in UHuai 
afternoon dress ; her rooms are attractive with flowers 
and pictures, but no refreshments are 8er\'ed. Her 
guests find her, not sitting at the receipt of customs, , 
but busy with some elegant trifle of lace or wool-work, \ 
writing letters, or touching a sketch, to be laid aside on 
the entrance of visitors. 

The set afternoon reception is announced by this form 
of card, the hostess usually preferring to have some 
young lady with her to add to the attractions of her 
house.

34 THE HOME COOK BOOK. 

If there be a card receiver in the hall, the visitor's card 
is left in it, that the hostess may have the pleasure after- 
ward of recalling all the friends who favour her with 
their presence. 

Coffee, chocolate, cake and ices, are to be found in a 
side room at such receptions. 

The form of card for afternoon tea, which means ladies 
in visiting or carriage dress, a harlequin tea service, each 
cup different, or a set of choice East India China, rooms 
cosj'^ with warm curtains, and signs of womanly occupa- 
tion, everything in short to have the daintiest home-look 
possiye, are issued in this fashion : 

Mkh. IIhadley Cowlks, 
Friday, January 18th, 
Tea at 4 o'clock. 
(Name and No. of street.) 

Guests arrive in the five minutes before the hour, or the 
five minutes after. The tea is brought in punctually and 
placed on the hostess' table in the corner, where are the 
urns of black, green and Russian tea for those who like 
each, a basket of wafers, delicate sandwiches of chicken 
or thin sliced meats, and a basket of fancy cake. If the ' 
English style is followed, the cups of tea are carried to 
the guests on a tray, and a tiny table to rest the cups on 
placed in the reach of each group. 

Cards are issued for dinner parties and afternoon recep- 
tions in distinction from evening parties and weddings, 
invitations to which are engraved on note paper. Written 
invitations are more complimentary than printed ones, 
but the idea of cards and engraved requests is to save 
the labour of writing notes for a large party, or 



SOCIAL OBSKBVANCBS. S6 

where one entertainH continually. Written invita* 
tions for the honour and style of the thing, carda 
and engraving for convenience, though this is perhaps 
contrary to the popular notion. Written invitations 
should be as fastidiously correct as printed ones, on 
mill-finished side-fold note sheets with cipher in the 
comer, and written in the same form as cards, unless to 
a familiar friend, when such precision would be absurd. 
Outside envelopes are only used when invitations are 
sent by mail. And whether so requested in the note or 
not, answer to accept or decline should be sent as soon 
as possible, no matter how slight the invitation may be, 
even to dine with a gentleman, or go to a picture gal- 
lery. It win not do to present oneself without a word 
to announce one's coming, or to stay away and appolo- 
gize the first time of meeting. Good breeding is hardly 
shown in nicer points than this. 

The person entering a room is the one to salute the 
company by a good morning, or how do you do, and to 
make his adieus, to which the rest respond. Where a 
stranger enters a small company, each one should be 
separately presented. The guest salutes the hostess and 
host before speaking to anyone else, and if the party is 
large, is introduced to two or three convenient persons 
that he may have somebody to talk to, though in a pri- 
vate house guests may accost each other without formal 
presentation. Near the close of a party, the host and 
hostess usually are to be found near the door of the par- 
lour, and guests take leave of them with a bow and 
compliment for a pleasant evening, then pass to the 
dressing rooms after wraps and vanish without farther 



S6 THE HOME COOK BOOK. 

ceremony. In small circles a bow should be given to 
each person about one, and leave taken of any special 
friend whose conversation has been particularly pleasant. 

A gentleman does not shake hands with a lady not of 
his kindred, unless she offers to do so. Unmarried 
ladies do not give their hands in salute to any but gen- 
tlemen relations. Ladies in any case give the hand, 
the gentleman respectfully presses it without shaking. 
It is a piece of stupid bad breeding, however, not to take 
the hand of anyone offered in ignorance of the rule. 
The best breeding always adapts itself to the customs of 
those about one. 

When a gentleman escorts a lady to a party, he waits 
for her near the door of the ladies' dressing-room till 
she shows herself, gives her his right arm, or gives it to 
the elder lady if he takes two, and goes tip to the host- 
ess with her to make salutations, then after a sentence 
or two, turning away to join the company. After a 
dance with any lady it is proper to take half a turn 
round the room in promenade with her, and take her to 
the refeshment room if she wishes, always leaving her 
with her chaperone. An unmarried lady does not ask 
gentlemen to call, but the gentleman asks permission 
for the favour of her, or waits to be invited by her 
father or mother. 




LITTLE HOUSEKEEPERS. 



It often happens that a good deal of knowledge which 
we are not conscious of possessing — but which finds its 
way somehow into the brains of big and little people as 
well — comes very readly to hand when it is needed. It 
so happened with Annie and Jennie, whose first practi- 
cal lessons in housekeeping, began after breakfast one 
morning when Bridget was absent at her sister's funeral 
and in consequence of an accident by which maiuma 
sprained her ankle. 

And the doctor had said, with a very wise shake of 
hLs head, and any amount of wisdom in his eye, that 
" Little ^Mother " must not step on that foot for three 
days, she grew still whiter with dismay, for Bridget 
would not be back until quite late in the day, and how 
was all the house work to be done and nobody to do it ? 

It was thus that Annie's and Jennie'9 first practical 
experiences in housekeeping began, and as our object in 
telling you how and what they did is to give you some 
idea how you should manage in similar circumstances 
I must not pa.ss over their mother's first caution : Brforc 
eomrmncing ymir work pi-epare yourselves for it. This 
ihey did by putting long sleeved aprons over their 



88 THE HOME COOK BOOK. 

dresses, and rolHng back their sleeves, when it was evident 
the right place to begin with was 

THE DINING ROOM. 

The first thing here to do, was the clearing of the 
table. In this, all the clean silver, china, and dishes 
that had not been used, were first put away in the silver 
drawer, the china closet and on the side-board. Next, 
the dishes to be cleaned were collected together ; the 
silver and the knives were first put into a pitcher of hot 
water, with the bowls and blades dowmwards. Next, the 
water was emptied from the glasses, and the coffee from 
the cups into a basin, and while Annie took these into 
the kitchen and placed them there on the table, Jennie 
gathered the plates in a pile, the cups and the saucers, 
each by themselves, in this way they were quickly and 
easily carried to the kitchen. 

They were careful not to take too many at once, as 
they would be liable to break them. Then the table- 
cloth was folded and laid in the side-board ; the napkins 
were put in the napkin basket ; the dining room floor 
was nicely swept and the furniture dusted ; the coal stove 
was attended to, that the fire was not too lively and not 
too low ; and then, after kissing and petting mamma a 
few minutes, the little housekeepers set about 

THE WASHING OF THE DISHES. 

This, of course, with " Little Mother " at the head of 
aliairs, was no disagreeable work, you may be sure. The 
large Uu dish-pan, as bright as silver, was placed in the 



THE LITTLI H0USEKEEPEB8. 59 

sink ; the hot and cold water faucets turned on until the 
temperature of the water was hot enough for cleansing 
the dishes, and not too hot for the hands ; then the suds 
were made by stirring about in the water the soap-shaker 
(a little tin box with soap in it, and perforated with holes 
having a long handle like a dipper). Then the glasses 
were first washed and quickly wiped on clean dry towels ; 
then the silver ; then the pretty china cups, saucers, 
plates and other dishes, which were then rinsed by pour- 
ing clear hot water over them in another pan, from which 
they were wiped with the coarser towels. This finished, 
Jennie removed the dishes from the kitchen table, putting 
the silver, glass and china away, while Annie washed 
the sauce-pans and the tins, putting them in their places 
in the kitchen ; then brushed the range and swept the 
kitchen floor ; after which they washed their hands well 
and dried them on the roller-towel ; and then our little 
housekeepers set themselves about preparations for 

THE CHAMBER WORK, 

First, the two little girls went into mamma's room, 
and put on over their blight glossy curls two little 
Martha Washington dusting-caps of pink and blue cam- 
bric, trimmed around the edges with scolloped ruffles, 
and ornamented with pretty little fanciful bows of pink 
and blue cambric, with scolloped edges. Then Annio 
took the pails and cloths, and Jennie the brushes, and 
brooms, and went up stairs. 

The first rule of chamber work is to open the windows 
and turn down the bed clothes to air them well ; beating 
up the pillows and the mattress. Aa Annie and Jeuoit 



40 THE HOME COOK BOOK. 

always did this the first thing after dressing in the morn- 
ing, and before going down to breakfast, the first thing 
now to do was to make up the bed. While Annie went 
to the further side, Jennie remained on the other, and 
thus, each sheet and blanket was brought up and laid 
over straight and smooth, with not a wrinkle in sheet 
or blanket, or a single article out of line. "When all was 
done, the spread and blankets were turned neatly back, 
with the pretty ruffled sheet lying back on the nice white 
counterpane; the- clothes were all neatly tucked and 
folded at the sides and the corners, and the pillows put 
up against the headboard. Then, while Annie washed 
the bed-room service, first emptying the waste water, and 
then washing out the cleanest dishes in warm suds, 
Jennie brushed the room, dusted the furniture and put 
the hair and clothes-brushes in order, and arranged the 
bureau and toilet table. They followed the same order 
in their brother John's room, which was all of the cham- 
ber work to be done that day, and then went down stairs. 
By this time the little housekeepers began to feel tired, 
and so they rested a while in their two little easy chairs 
in mamma's room, talking to mamma and each other 
until it came the time for getting ready for the 

LUNCHEON. 

As John took his dinner with him to school, and papa 
ate his luncheon down town, and would not be home 
until the five o'clock dinner, there was only mamma and 
the two liitle girls to partake of this repast together ; and 
as mamma's luncheons were such cosy, tasteful, though 
simple meals, we may gain some suggestions from the way 




THK UTTLK HOUSEKEEPltRS. 41 

our little housekeepers prepaied them. The fi/at thing 
to do in getting any meal, is to decide upon the yariqua 
dishes to be served. A look at the supply of prepared 
food was quite dishcarteniug to the ambitious desires 
of the littio housekeepers, as there was bread and cake 
and cold meat in plenty, and it seemed as though there 
would be no opportunity for practising their skill in 
cooking. But mamma, w])0 saw the troubled look on 
the little faces, made out the following 

BILL OF FARE. 

Tea. 

White Bread. Brown Bread. Cracker*. 

Ham. 

Cheese Sandwichea. 

Joiiiblea. Pre«erved Starawberrie«. 

Whipped Cream. 

Now, it must be remembered, that in this arrange- 
neut, the bread was at hand ready to slice ; the ham 
was boiled, ready to cut ; and the strawberries ready in 
the little glass can to be opaned. There remained, 
therefore, jumbles and tea to make, and the cheese 
sandwiches to prepare. Following mamma's' advice, 
they first undertook the jumbles, of which they were to 
make but half the recipe. They selected for this " Ex- 
cellent Jumbles," in the HOME cook book, and while 
Jennie held the book and read the ingredients, Annie 
collected them together. Thus : one-half a cup of but- 
ter, one cup of sugar, and one-half cup of cream, and 
one-half teaspoon of soda. When Jennie came to the 
one egg of the recipe, they had some trouble how they 
should manage to make it half an egg ; but after con- 
laltation with mamma, they concluded to vary irum tJa*

given rule, and put the whole egg in. Then Jennie read 
on : "A little nutmeg ; flour enough to stiffen it, so as 
to bake in rings ; bake quickly." 

The flour was sifted; the butter and sugar first 
creamed together by Annie, while Jennie beat the yoke 
of the egg, and added it to the creamed sugar and but- 
ter ; then they put in the nutmeg, the cream and the 
soda ; then the beaten white of the egg, and the sifted 
flour ; then they put the jumbles into the buttered rings 
and baked them. As the oven was quick and hot, I am 
happy to say these jumbles were a success. In taking 
them out of the tins when done, they did not pile them on 
one another, but placed them carefully itbout on a large 
plate to cool. Tber the little housek eepers made the 
tea, according to the directions in the Cook Book, and 
also the cheese sandwiches, which were a complete suc- 
cess. The cutting of the bread was a difficult task, since 
to be nice the slices should be even and thin, but it was 
managed nevertheless with patience and care. When 
all was ready, the cream nicely whipped, the strawber- 
ries put in the preserve dish, the little round table in 
mamma's room drawn out, and the luncheon arranged, 
they were just ready to sit down to enjoy the fruits of 
their labour, what should they hear but Bridget's voice 
at the door. So it came to pass, that with the luncheon 
ended for this time the practical experiments of our little 
housekeepers. But it all goes to prove that, if we live 
with our eyes open, we shall all of us find that, with 
such help as our Home Cook Book, we shall be ready 
for those emergencies which come to big as well as th« 
Uttle housekeepers, when Bridget is not at hand. 




OUB SUSAITS OPINION OF A KiTOHaN. 



* My opinion of a kitchen ?" said Susan, in a tone, with 
a glance, and a wave of her fork that spoke unwritten 
volumes, as she translated the perfection of fried cakes 
from the frying kettle to a tin colander to drain ; " My 
opinion of a kitchen ? Well, that would vary somewhat 
with the mansion that contained it. In any case, how- 
ever, it would be the pleasantest room in the house, if I 
had the ordering of things." 

The queen of our kitchen said this with a half smile 
and a half apology, as she continued : " It makes a good 
deiil of difference, you know, to one who is to spend the 
best part of her time there. I often think that many 
people with whom money ia no object, have very limited 
ideaa of their responsibilities when it comes to the ser- 
vant's quarter in the houses they build, with all they may 
have of modern improvements and conveniences. 

" I have no conceit of those fine houses," said she, 
with considerable asperity of manner, " with not a room 
in it but where a regiment might meander comfortably 
about among the furniture but the kitchen, which is only 
large enough for the mnge, the sink, the ironing table, 

and the cook. Neither for my part, could I ever 

see what those people are thinking about who do not 
keep servants, and where th« mistress expects to do her

own work, who allows, of all rooms in the house, her 
kitchen to be built a dark little box of a place, prevaded 
with the sole idea of work Of work, too, without one 
gleam of cheerfulness about it, and from which every one 
who enters escapes with a glad feeling of relief. For 
my part," she continued, " I don't see why making fried 
cakes, and baking biscuit, and washing dishes, might not 

be made as bright and attractive as, well, as any 

thing eUe one has to do in the way of house work. 

" My opinion of a kitchen, ' as is a kitchen,' is one with 
room enough about lor the many little things and com- 
forts that give it a home-like look ; a ' living room,' as we 
used to call our kitchen in the old home. For instance 
this comes the nearest my idea of it ; always excepting 
that," she said, with a gratified glance around at the 
pretty clock on its pretty bracket, and the newspaper 
rack, (for Susan enjoyed the papers,) at the various nick- 
nacks, and the landscapes, and home views, which Susan 
prized far above the costly conventional fruit and game 
pieces on the dining room walls. And then Susan's 
glance wandered, with a pleased softened look to the 
sunny window, with its geranium pots and hanging 
basket, near which the most cheerful of canaries in his 
cage made all the air melodious with song. Here, also, 
stood an easy chair inviting rest for those moments of 
waiting upon work which so often occur, and near it a 
stand with drawers for all sorts of Httle treasures which 
contained all of fancy work in which Susan ever indulged, 
"That easy chair, and that window, are great comforts 
to me," she resumed. '*Now, if there was but one 
wixtdow to my kitchen, aiiU ib(> -^i ik before that, as I &e«

in 80 many kitchens, if i had to take refuge ia a stitF- 
backed chair in a dark corner or the middle of the room 
where I could reach oui and touch the walls all around 
while I was waiting for ttie biscuit to rise, or the cake 
was baking, as I sat there glaring at some dark melan- 
choly paper, instead of this bright cheerful tint of gray, 
with its hints of rose and violet, and then with the 
wood- work about, of an ugly, dingy blue, or mud col- 
oured brown, in.steaa of this bright-grained wood, with 
gleams of sunshine m it on the darkest days, and that ia 
so easy to keep clean and is as pretty as a picture. I 
think if this wa." *''^i kind of a kitchen, I would nm 
away with the mi'kman some bright morning — I actu- 
ally think I would." This is a standing joke of our 
Susan's, but one nevertheless that brings fear and con- 
•tematioQ in our household whenever it is revived. " I 
suppose I was spoiled for that sort of thing in my early 
days," said she, meditatively, with a look in her eyes 
that went out for the moment, "^ver the hills and far 
away," to the kitchen, wneie we firet found our Susan. 

It was a wide, loru^ room — so wide and long that the 
dresser and clock and tables and large old-fashioned 
furniture that stood here and there, never intruded 
themselves, but in la**^**. comely, decorous, but uncom- 
promising dignity, formed each a part of the hai-moui- 
oua whole. There was an indescribable charm about 
it, always orderly, alwavs bright and the centre of a 
home-life where its duties went on in that easy cheerful 
wav, a pleasure lioth to sight and sense. About its

bered in sweet coiifusion, and through which the scent

of the fragrant sweet-briar came floating in, with the 
song of the woodland birds and the pleasant farm 
sounds, and a vision of the far away hills, in their ever 
varying beauty of light and shadow ; while within, in 
conscious enjoyment of it all, was Susan, stepping mer- 
rily about, making custard pies, or folding the fragrant 
linen, fresh from the line, for the morrow's ironing, 
But the prettiest picture of that old kitchen was of a 
winter evening, when the winds blew furiously without, 
of the grand old fire-place, with its heaping wood fire, 
over which on the crane the kettle hung, humming and 
singing, and sending up the chimney white clouds of 
steam, while before it stood the tin baker which held 
the rich juicy roast, or the light snowy biscuit, the like 
of which never came out of any range that ever was, or 
will be invented ; while the fire lighted up the fine old 
room with a rich warm glow, as Susan set the table with 
its snowy linen and polished ware, and golden butter, 
and luscious honey in the comb, and all those charming 
fancies she knew so well how to prepare. And to com- 
plete the picture, the comfortable easy chairs by the 
fire where the grandmother sat in placid enjoyment with 
her knitting, and not very far away, the father, tired 
with the work of the day, giving himself to the rest ana 
comforts of the evening hour. This w the picture that 
rose so vividly before me, but which had faded all too 
suddenly from our Susan^s past. 

Ah, well 1 said she, after a time coming out of her 
reverie with a little sigh and back again, to her opinion 
of a kitchen.

selection from her small stock of poetical fancies, but 
checking herself before reaching the concluding lines of 
this stanza. 

" My opinion," she said, with a sudden change of tone 
and manner as she sniffed the air — is — that until some 
contrivance is invented to carry out all the steam, smoke, 
and smell of frying, that with all my care, and in spite 
of windows, and doors, and ventilatoi-s, will hang about 
my kitchen, the milleninm won't come ; and if it does, 1 
shan't be in it." 

As she said this, we looked around, and there stood 
the Pater. And we knew by the look in his eyes that he 
had heard these words of Susan's. And thus it wUi 
happen, that the Pater who is a "born inventor, but who 
in the hurry and worry of business life has limited 
opportunities for the indulgence of this natural bent of 
his genius, will seize upon this idea with the pretext of a 
duty, and with which he will retire to the depths of his 
inner consciousness, there to evolve some strange contriv- 
ance hereafter to assume form and shape for the comfort- 
ing of " Our Su^jan's " kitchen. \

SOUPS. 



" No nwless dish our table crowds ; 
Haruioiiiously ranged and consonantly just, 
As in a concert instrumenta resound, 
Our ordered dishes in their courses chiuio." 

Tlie basis of all good soups, is the broth of meat. 
This may be made by boiling the cracked joints of beef, 
veal or mutton, and is best when cooked the day before 
it' if to be eaten. After putting the meat into the pot, 
ovver it well with cold water and let it come to a boil, 
when it should be well skimmed. Set the pot where it 
will simmer slowly until it is thoroughly done, keeping 
the pot closely covered the while. The next day, when 
the soup is cold, remove the fat, which will harden on 
the top of the soup. After this, add the vegetables and 
the herbs you use for seasoning, cooking all well together. 
Before sending to the table, the soup should be strained. 
A good stock for soups may be made from shreds and 
bits of uncooked meat and bones, poultry and the re- 
mains of game. When these are all put together and 
stewed down in the pot, the French term it consomme, 
and use it chiefly in the preparation of brown soups. 

Soups may be varied in many ways, chiefly in the kinds 
of vegetables and ditierent seasonings used, — as in herbs,

ing, (over water to prevent scorching.) When the toma- 
toes are done add a large teaspoonful of salaratus, which 
will cause a violent effervescence. It is best to set the 
vessel in a pan before adding it to prevent waste. 
When the commotion has ceased add the milk and

salt and parsley ; make into balls and boil two minutes. 

NOODLES FOR SOUP, 

Mrs F. D. J. 

Rub into two eg^ as much sifted flour as they will 
absorb ; then roll out until thin as a wafer ; dust over 
a little flour, and then roll over and over into a roll ; 
cut oft' thin slices from the edge of the roll and shake 
out into long strips ; put them into the soup lightly and 
boil for ten minutes ; salt should be added while mixing

and soups. 



FISH. 



"The iilvery fiah. 
Grazing at large in meadowa aubmaiiiM^ 
Fre&b from the wave now cheers 
Oar festive board." 

—Asoa. 

Fish are good, when the gills are red, eyes are fnll, and 
the body of the fish is firm and stiff. After washing them 
well, they should beaUowed to remain for a short time in 
salt water sufficient to cover them ; before cooking, wipe 
them dry, dred^^e lightly with flour, and season with salt 
and pepper, Salmon trout and other small fish are 
usually fried or broiled ; all large fish should be put in a 
cloth, tied closely with twine, and placed in cold water, 
when they may be put over thr fire to boil. When fish 
are baked, prepare the fish the same as for boiling, and 
put in the oven on a wire gridiron, over a dripping pan.

Cod-Fish — requires great care in cleaning, particularly 
in cleansing the back-bone from blood which spoils its 
appearance, and sometimes renders it too unsightly for 
the table. Fishes that are to de dressed in their scale%

should be dijjped in water, and rubbed with a coarse 
towel to remove the shine. All salt fish should be 
properly soaked in water, previous to cooking. It is 
asserted that a small proportion of sugar will keep fish 
perfectly fresh for several days ; it also cures salmon and 
white fish with a little salt added to please the taste 
Fresh water fish has often a muddy smell and taste ; to 
take this off", soak it in strong salt and water after it ia 
nicely cleansed, then dry and dress it. 

BOILED WHITE FISH. 

Mrs. Andrews. 

Lay the fish open ; put it in a dripping pan, with the 
back down ; nearly cover with water ; to one fish put two 
tablespoons salt ; cover tightly and simmer (not boil) one- 
hall" hour ; dress with gravy, butter and pepper ; garnish 
with sliced eggs. 

For sauce use a piece of butter the size of an egg, one 
tablespoon of flour, one- half pint boiling water ; boil a 
few minutes, and add three hard boiled eggs, sliced. 

FISH A LA CREME. 

Mrs. J. A. Ellis. 

Take any firm salt water fish, rub it with salt and put 
it in a. kettle with enough boiling water to cover it. Ab 
soon as it boils set it back where it will simmer, let it 
stand for an hour, then take it up and draw out all the 
bones. Put one ounce of flour into a sauce-pan, to which 
add by degrees one quart of cream or new milk, mixing it 
very smoothly, then add the juice of one lemon, oq« 



▼ALUABLE RECIPKS. 65 

onion chopped fine, a bunch of parsley, a little nutmeg, 

salt and popper. Put this on the fire, stirring it till it 

forms a thick sauce; stir in a quarter of a pound of 

butter ; strain the sauce through a sieve. Put a little on 

a dish, then lay the fish on it and turn the remainder of 

the sauce over it. Beat to a froth the whites of six eggs, 

spread over the whole, and bake half an hour a light 

brown. 

SAUCE FOR BOILED FISH. 

To one teacup of milk ; add one teacup of water ; put 
it on the Hre to scald, and when hot stir in a tablespoon 
of flour, previously wet with cold water ; add two or 
three eggs ; season with salt and pepper, a little celery, 
vinegar and three tablespoons of butter. Boil four or 
five eggs hard, take off" the shells, and cut in slices, and 
lay over the dish. Then pour over the sauce and serve. 

BAKED HALIBUT OR SALMON. 

Let the fish remain in cold water, slightly salted, for 
an hour before it is time to cook it ; place the gridiron 
on a dripping pan with a little hot water in it and bake 
in a hot oven; just before it is done, Vnitter it 'well on 
the top, and brown it nicely. The time of baking de- 
pends upon the size of the fish. A small fish will bake 
in about half an hour, and a large one in an hour. 
They arc very nice when cooked as above and served 
with a sauce which is made from the gravy in the drip- 
ping pan, to which is added a tablespoon of catsup and 
another of some pungent sauce and the juice of a lemon 
Thi<'kpn with brown flour moistened with a little cold

water. Garnish handsomely with sprigs of paisley and 
currant jelly. 

BAKED BLACK BASS. 

Mm. p. B. Ayer. 

Eight good sized onions chopped fine ; half that 
quantity of bread crumbs ; butter size of hen's egg ; 
plenty of pepper and salt, mix thoroughly with anchovj- 
sauce until quite red. Stuff your fish with this com- 
pound and pour the rest over it, previously sprinkling 
it with a little red pepper. Shad, picker«l and trout 
are good the same way. Tomatoes can be used instead 
of anchovies, and are more economical. If usins them 
take pork in place of butter and chop fine. 

BROILED WHITE FISH—FRESH. 

Mrs. G. E. P. 

Wash and drain the fish ; sprinkle with pepper and 
lay with the inside down upon the gridiron, and broil 
over fresh bright coals. When a nice brown, turn for 
a moment on the other side, then take up and spread 
with butter. This is a very nice way of broiling all 
kinds of fish, fresh or salted. A little smoke under the 
fish adds to its flavour. This may be made by putting 
two or three cobs under the gridiron. 

SALT MACKEREL. 

Mrs. F. D. J. 

Soak the fish for a few hours in lukewarm water, 
clianging the water several times ; then put into cold

water loosely tied in cloths, and let the fish come to a 
boil, turning off the water once, and pouring over the 
fish hot water from the tea kettle ; let this just come to 
a boil, then take them out and drain them, lay them on 
a platter, butter and pepper them, and place them for a 
few moments in the oven. Serve with sliced lemons, 
or with any nice fish sauce. 

BOILED CODFISH— SALT. 

Soak two pounds of codfish in lukewarm water over 
night or for several hours ; change the water several 
times ; about one hour before dinner put this into cold 
fresh water, and set over the fire ; let it come to a boil, 
or just simmer, for fiften minutes but not to boil hard, 
then take out of the water, drain and serve with egg 
sauce, or with cold boiled eggs sliced and laid over it, 
with a drawn butter or cream gravy poured over all. 

CODFISH BALLS, 

Take equal quantities of mashed potatoes and boiled 
codfish minced fine ; to each half-pound allow one ounce 
of butter and a well-beaten egg ; mix thoroughly. Press 
into balls between two spoons; drop into liot lard, and 
fry till brown.

POTTED FISH. 

Mra. Oridley. 

Take out the backbone of the fish ; for one weighing 
two pounds take a tablespoon of allspice and cloves 
mixed ; these spices should be put into little bags of not 
too thick muslin ; put sufficient salt directly upon each 
fish ; then roll in cloth, over which sprinkle a little 
cayenne pepper ; put alternate Kbyers of fish, spice and 
sago in an earthen jar ; cover with the best cider vinegar ; 
cover the jar closely with a plate and over this put a 
covering of dough, rolled out twice the thickness of pie 
crust. Make the edges of paste, to adhere closely to the 
sides of the jar, so as to make it air-tight. Put the jar 
into a pot of cold water and let it boil from three to fivo 
hours, according to quantity. Ready when cold.

POULTRY. 

When poultry is brought into the kitchen for use, ik 
should be kept as- cool as possible. The best position 
in which to place it is with the breast downwards on a 
shelf or marble slab. The crop should be taken out. 
Choose fowls with a thin, transparent skin, white and 
delicate. Time required to boil poultry : a chicken 
will take about 20 minutes ; a fowl about 40 minutes ; a 
small turkey an hour and a half; a large turkey two 
hours or more. 

BOILED FOWL. 

Take a young fowl and fill the inside with oysters ; 
place in a jar and plunge into a kettle of water ; boil for 
one and one-half hours ; there will be a quantity of 
gravy in the jar from the juice of the fowl antl the 
oysters ; make this into white sauce with the addition 
of e^, cream, or a little flour and butter ; add oysters, 
or serve up plain with the fowl. This is very nice with 
the addition of a little parsley to the sauce.

ROAST TURKEY OR CHICKEN. 

Having picked and drawn the fowls, wash them "well 
in two or three waters ; wipe them dry ; dredge them 
with a little flour inside and out, and a little pepper and 
salt ; prepare a dressing of bread and cracker crumbs, 
fill the bodies and crops of the fowls and then bake them 
from two to three hours ; baste them frequently while 
roasting ; stew the giblets in a sauce-pan ; just before 
serving, chop the giblets fine ; after taking up the 
chicken, and the water in which the giblets were boiled, 
add the chopped giblets to the gravy of the roast fowl ; 
thicken with a little flour, which has been previously 
wet with the water ; boil up, and serve in a gravy-dish. 
Roast chickens and turkey should be accompanied with 
celery and jellies.

ON THE PREPARATION OF HASHES, GRAVIES, 
" AND SAUCE& 

Mnt. Jas. Beaty. 

There is nothing worse for the health, or for the palate, 
than a poor haah while a good hash is not only a 
favourite dish in most families, but an essential article 
of economy and convenience. For this reason a separate 
article is devoted to this subject. The following are the 
ways in which hashes are spoilt. The first is by cooking 
them. Meat, when once cooked, should only be heated. 
If it is again stewed or fried, it tends to make it hard at 



78 THE HOME COOK BOOK. 

tough, and diminishes its flavour. The second is by fry- 
ing the butter or gravy in which they are prepared. It 
has been shown that this is very injurious to the health- 
fuhiess of food. Butter and oils may be melted without 
changing their nature, but when cooJced, they become 
much more indigestible and injurious to weak stomachs. 
The third mode of injuring hashes is by putting in flour 
in such ways that it is not properly cooked. Flour 
dredged on to hashes while they are cooking imparts the 
raw taste of dough. The fourth mode is by putting in 
so much water as to make them vapid, or else so much 
grease as to make them gross. The fifth is by seasoning 
them with so little care, that they either have very little 
savory taste, or else are so hot with pepper and spice as to 
be unhealthy. If a housekeeper will follow these direc- 
tions, or give them to a cook who will follow them exactly, 
she will always have good and healthful hashes.

cayenne in a tea cup, with warm water to the consistency 
of cream and cover every part of the meat with the 
mixture; have ready some nice stock or thin giavy; 
put all together into a stew-pan, and let it stew gently 
for twenty minutes ; before serving slice two or three 
apples, let them stew away ; this addition is thought to 
be a great improvement, as it makes the curry milder ;

each cup of meat ; gravy enough to moisten the crumbs 
and chicken ; or, if you have no gravy, a little drawn 
butter ; pepper and salt and chopped jarsley to taste ; 
yolks of two hard boiled eggi* rubbed fine with the back 
of a silver spoon, added to the meat ; mix up into a paste 
with as little handling as may be ; nor must the paste be 
too wet to mould readily ; make with floured hands int^o 
rolls or ovate balls, roll in flour until well coated, and 
fry a few at a time, lest crowding should injure the 
shape, in nice dripping, or a mixture half lard and half 
butter. As you take them out lay in a hot colander, 
that every drop of fat may be drained off! Serve in a 
heated dish with cresses or parsley. 

CHICKEN CROQUETTEa 

Mn. J. A. Ellis. 

Four and one-half pounds chicken boiled and chopped 
very tine ; moisten to a thick pulp with the liquor in 
which it has been boiled. Mix with this a pint and a 
half of mashed potatoes, beaten to a cream ; three eggs,

one teaspoon of mustard, sweet marjoram, salt and pepper 
to taste ; a little celery chopped very fine ; soften with 
milk till very soft, and add a quarter of a pound of butter. 
Mould into forms, dip in egg and cracker dust, and try 
in boiling lard. 

CHICKEN PATES 

Mlnoe chicken that has been previously roasted or 
boiled, and season well ; stir into this a sauce made of 
half a pint of milk, into which, while boiling, a teaspoon- 
ful of com starch has been added to thicken ; season with 
butter, about a teaspoonful, then salt and pepper to 
taste. Have ready small pate pans lined with a good 
puff paste. Bake the crust in a brisk oven ; then fill the 
pans and set in the oven a few minutes to brown very 
slightly. 

DUCKS. 

Miss S. P. 

When roasted, use dressing as for turkey, with the 
addition of a few slices of onion. Many cooks lay over 
the game slices of onions, which take away the fishy 
flavour, removing the onion before serving. Make a 
sauce with the drippings in the pan in which the game 
is roasted, and to which are put the chopped giblets, 
which are previously well cooked ; thicken the gravy with 
brown flour, moistened with water. Serve with currant 
jelly. 

ROAST GOOSE. 

Stuff and roast in the same manner as ducks. Many 
cooks cover poultry with a paste of flour and water whik 
baking, removing it before it is sei Vid.

TO ROAST WILD FOWL. 

M. A. T. 

Put an onion, Halt and hot water into a pan, and baste 
for ten or fifteen minutes ; change the pan ; put in a slice 
of salt pork and baste with butter and pork drippings very 
often ; just before serving dredge lightly with flour and 
baste. Ducks take from twenty-five to thirty-five minutes 
to roast, and woodcock and snipe fifteen to twenty-five. 

Do not draw or take oft' the heads of either. Garnish 
with fried or toasted bread, lemon, parsley, and currant 

jelly. 

PRAIRIE CHICKENS, PARTRIDGES, AND QUAILS. 

Miss Sarah Page. 

Clean nicely, using a little soda in the water in which 
they are washed ; rinse and dry, then fill with dressing, 
sewing up nicely, binding down the legs and wings with 
cords. Put in a steamer over hot water, and let them 
cook until just done. Then place in a pan with a little 
butter ; sot in the oven and baste frequently with melt- 
ed butter until of a nice brown. They ought to brown 
nicely in about fifteen minutes. Serve on a platter, with 
sprigs of parsley alternating with currant jelly. 

QUAIL ON TOAST. 

After the birds are nicely cleaned, cut them open down 
the back ; salt and pepper them, and dredge with flour. 



YAl.l ABLK RECni'KS'. 85 

Break down the breast and back-l»one.s, so they will lie flat, 
and place them in a pan with very little water and but- 
ter in a hot oven, covering them up tightly until nearly 
done. Then place in a spider in hot butter, and fry 
a moment to a nice brown. Have ready slices of baker's 
bread toasted, and slightly buttered upon a platter. The 
toast should be broken down with a carving knife, so that 
it will be tender. On this place the quaii ; make a sauce 
of the gravy in the pan, thicken lightly with browned flour, 
and pour over each quail and the toast. 

A SUGGESTION. 

M. A. T. 

Singe all poultry with alcohol, and dip quails into clari- 
fied butter for broiling. 

PRESSED CHICKEN. 

Mrs. C. Belford. 

Cut up the fowls and place in a kettle with a tight cover, 
80 as to retain the steam; put about two teacups of water 
and plenty of salt and pepper over the chicken, then let 
it cook until the moat cleaves easily from the bones, cut 
or chop all the meat (freed from skin, bone and gristle) 
about as for chicken salad ; season well, put into a dish 
and pour the remnant of the juice in which it was cooked 
over it This will jelly when cold, and can then be sliced 
or set on the table in shape. Nice for tea or lunch. The 
knack of making this simple dish is not having too much 
water ; it will not jelly if too weak, or if tue water is 
•Ilowed to boil away entirely while cooking.

PIGEON PIE. 

Mrs. L. 

Make a fine puff paste ; lay a border of it around a large 
dish, and cover the bottom with a veal cutlet, or a very 
tender steak free from fat and bone ; season with salt, 
cayenne pepper, and mace. Prepare as many pigeons as 
can be put in one layer of the dish ; put in each pigeon a 
small lump of butter, and season with pepper and salt ; 
lay them in the dish breast downwards, and cut in slices 
a half dozen of hard boiled eggs, and lay in with the birds ; 
put in more butter, some veal broth, and cover the whol<» 
with crust. Bake slowly for an hour and a half. 

BKOILED PIGEONS OR SQUABS. 

Marion Harland. 

Young pigeons or " squabs " are rightly esteemed a great 
delicacy. They are cleaned, washed, and dried carefully 
with a clean cloth ; then split down the back, and broil- 
ed like chickens. Season with pepper and salt, and 
butter liberally in dishing them. They are in great 
request in a convalescent's room, being peculiarly savory 
4nd nourishing.

GENERAL RULES FOR COOKING MEATa 

All salt meat should be put on in cold water, that the 
nfdt may be extracted while cooking. Fresh meat, which 
is boiled to be served with sauces at the table, should be 
put to cook in boiling water ; when the outer fibres con- 
tract, the inner juices are preserved. 

For making soup, put the meat over in cold water, to 
extract the juices for the broth. 

In boiling meats, if more water is needed, add that 
which is hot, and be careful to keep the water on the 
meat constantly boiling. 

Remove the scum when it first begins to boil. The 
more gently meat boils, the more tender it will become. 
Allow twenty minutes for boiling each pound of fiesh 
meat. 

Roast meats require a brisk fire. Baste often. Twenty 
minutes is required for roasting each pound of fresh 
meat. The variation in roasted meats consists simply 



88 THE HOME COOK BOOK. 

in the method of preparing them to cook, before putting 
them in the oven. Some are to be larded, some stuffed 
with bread dressing, and others plain, only seasoning 
with pepper and salt. 

A piece of red pepper, cooked in a boiled dinner, is 
very nice. • 

ROAST BEEF. 

Mrs. C. Belford. 

Prepare for the oven by dredging lightly with flour, 
and seasoning witli salt and pepper; place in the oven, 
and baste frequently while roasting. Allow a quarter 
of an hour for a pound of meat, if you like it rare ; 
longer if you like it well done. Serve with a sauce, 
made from the drippings in the pan, to which has been 
added a tablespoon of Harvey or Worcestershire sauce, 
and a tablespoon of tomato catsup,

leave it till you take up the beef ; leave it in about five 
minutes after you take up the beef ; then pour off the

BEEFSTEAK AND MUSHROOMS. 

Mr*. Perry H. Smith. 

Put in a saucepan, one ounce of butter, a small onion 
chopped fine, a little ground sage, and a little thyme, 
and put it over the tire ; wh«;n hot, shake in two table- 
spoons of flour, and when it becomes brown, put in one 
gill of water, and let it boil for half an hour. Then add 
three tablespoons of beef stock, a little salt, a little 
nutmeg and one wine glass of sherry wine. Put in one 
can of mushrooms, and let it boil for ten minutes. Pour 
this over a nicely broiled, beef steak. 

BROILED BEEFSTEAK. 

Lay a thick tender steak upon a gridiron over hot 
coals, having greased the bars with butter before the 
steak has been put upon it ; (a steel gridiron with slender 
bars is to be preferred, the broad flat iron bars of grid- 
irons commonly used fry and scorch the meat, impart- 
ing a disagreeable flavour). When done on one side, 
have ready your platter warmed with a little butter on 
it ; lay the steak upon the platter with the cooked side 
down, that the juices which have gathered may run on 
the platter, but do • not press the meat ; then lay your 
beefsteak again upon the gridiron cjuickly and cook the 
other side. When done to your liking, put again on the 



90 THE HOME COOK BOOK. 

platter, spread lightly with butter, place where it will keep 
warm for a few moments, but not to let the butter be- 
come oily, (over boiling steam is best) ; and then serve 
on hot plates. Beefsteak should never be seasoned with 
salt and pepper while cooking. If your meat is tough, 
pound tuell with a steak mallet on both sides. 

BEEF LOAF. 

Mrs. Caraon. 

Three and a half pounds veal or beef, minced very fine, 
and uncooked ; four large crackers, crushed very fine ; 
one egg, one cup of milk, butter the size of an egg, one 
tablespoon salt, one of pepper ; mix in shape of a loaf, 
and bake in a slow oven two hours and a half, basting 
often ; to be eaten cold ; very nice for tea or lunch. 

BEEF EN MIROTON. 

Mrs. S. McMaster. 

Cut thin slices of cold roast beef, and put them into a 
frying pan with some butter and six onions, turn the 
pan frequently, then mix a little broth, add pepper and 
salt, and after a few boils serve up hot. 

BEEF WITH TOMATOES. 

Mrs. P. B. Ayer. 

Eight pounds fresh plate beef, second cut broiled ; boil 
tender two quarts tomatoes, three cloves, plenty butter, 
pepper and salt ; when cooked nicely and thick, strain 
through a colander and pour over your beef and serve hot 
or cold. \

TO BOIL CORNED BEEF. 

tin, J. Beaty. 



Put the beef in water enough to cover it^ and let it 
heat slowly, and boil slowly, and be careful to take off 
the grease. Many think it much improved by boiling 
potatoes, turnips, and cabbages with it. In this case 
the vegetable must be pealed and alZ the grease care- 
fully skimmed as fast as it rises. -Allow about twenty 
minutes of boiling for each pound of meat. 

BEEF OR VEAL STEWED WITH APPLES. 

Mrs. James Beaty. 

Rub a stewpan with butter ; cut the meat in thin 
slices, and put in with pepper, salt, and apple, sliced 
fine; some would add a little onion. Cover it tight, 
and stew till tender. 

BEEFS HEART. 

Alarion Harland. 

Wash the heart well, and cut into squares half an inch 
long. Stew them for ten minutes in enough water to 
cover them. Salt the water slightly to draw out the 
blood, and throw it away as it rises in scum to the top. 
Take out the meat, strain the liquor, and return the chop- 
ped heart to it, with a sliced onion, a great spoonful of 
catsup, some parsley, a head of celery chopped fine, and 
cayenne pepper, with a large lump of butter. Stew un- 
til the meat is very tender, when add a tablespoonful oi 
browned flour to thicken. Boil up once, and serve. 



DOMESTIC RECEIPTS. 



TO COOK A HAM (VERY FINE). 

Mrs. J. Beaty 

Boil a common-sized ham four or fiv^ hours, then 
skin the whole and fit it tor the table ; then set it in an 
oven for half an hour, then cover it thickly with pounded 
rusk or bread crumbs, and set it back for half an hour. 
Boiled ham is always improved by setting it into an 
oven for nearly an hour, till much of the fat fries out; 
and this also makes it more tender. 

TO BOIL A LEG OF VEAL OR MUTTON. 

Miss Kate Beaty. 

Make a stuffing of bread and a quarter as much of 
Bult pork, chopped fine and seasoned with sweet herbs, 
l)L;pper and salt. Make deep gashes, or, what is better, 
take out the bone with a carving-knife and fill up with 
stuffing, and sew up the opening with strong thread. 
When there is a flap of flesh lap it over the opening and 
sew it down. Put it into a large pot and fill it with 
water, putting in a tablespoonful of salt, and let it sim- 
mer slowly three hours. If it is needful to add water

TO CORN BEEF. 

Mrs. A. M. Gibba. 

To each gallon of cold water, put one quart of rock 
salt, one ounce of salt-petre and four ounces of brown 
sugar, (it need not be boiled), as long as any salt remains 
undissolved, the meat will be sweet. If any scum should 
rise, scald and skim well ; add more salt, salt-petre and 
sugar ; as you put each piece of meat into the brine, rub 
over with salt. If the weather is hot, gash the meat to 
the bone, and put it in sal^. Put a flat stone or some 
weight on the meat to keep it under the brine. 

Or this : To every four gallons of water allow two 
pounds of brown sugar and six pounds of salt, boil about 
twenty minutes, taking off the scum ; the next day turn 
it on the meat packed in the pickling tub ; pour off this 
brine ; boil and strain every two months, adding three 
ounces of brown sugar and half a pound of common saltv 
It will keep good a year. Sprinkle the meat with salt 
the next day, wipe dry before turning the pickle over it. 
Let it entirely cover the meat ; add four ounces salt-petre. 
Canvas lids are excellent for covering, as they admit the

smoothly on thin slices of bread. Very nice. 

TRAVELLING LUNCH, 

Mrs. J. L. B. 

Chop sardines, ham, and a few pickles quite fine ; mix 
witli mustard, pepper, catsup, salt, and vinegar ; spread 
between bread nicely buttered. This u to be cut cross- 
wise, like jelly cake. 

BAKED HAM. 

Mrs. W. G. Davifl. 

• 

Most persons boil ham. It is much better baked, if 
baked right. Soak it for an hour in clean water and 
wipe it dry, next spread it all over with thin batter, and 
then put it into a deep dish* with sticks under it to keep 
it out of the gravy. When it is fully done and the bat- 
ter crusted on the flesh side, take off the skin and set it

all the fat, except a layer half an inch thick; cut otf with 
a sharp knife all the black-looking outside ; put the ham 
into your dripping pan, fat side uppermost, grate bread 
crust. over it and sprinkle a teaspoon of powdered sugar 
over it ; put it in the oven for half an hour, until it is a 
beautiful brown. Eat cold ; cut the nicest portion in 
slices ; tlie ragi^ed parts and odds and ends can be 
chopped fine and used for sandwiches ; or, by adding 
three eggs to one pint of chopped ham, and frying brown, 
you have a delicious omelette for breakfast or lunch. The 
bones should be put in a soup-kettle, the rind and fat 
should be rendered and strained for frying j)Otatoes and 
crullers. Ham cooked in this way will go nmch farther 
than when cooked in the ordinary manner. 

BOILED AND BAKED HAM. 

Mrs. P. B. Ayer. 

Boil your ham tender; cover it with the white of a raw 
egg, and sprinkle sugar or bread crumbs over it ; put it 
in the oven and brown ; it is delicious also covered with 
a regular cake icing and browned.

SALTING PORK. 

A. M. G. 

Cover the bottom of the barrel with salt an inch deep ; 
put down one layer of pork and cover that with salt hall 
an inch thick ; continue this until all your pork is disposed 
of ; then cover the whole with strong brine ; pack as 
tight as possible, the rind side down or next to the barrel ; 
keep the pork always under the brine by using an inner 
cover and clean stones. Should any scum arise, pour 
off the brine, scald it, and add more salt. Old brine can 
be boiled down, well skimmed, and used for a fresh supply. 

CURING HAMS. 

Mrs. Mulford. 

Hang up the hams a week or ten days, the longer the 
tenderer and better, if kept perfectly sweet; mix for 
each good-sized ham, one teacup of salt, one tablespoon 
of molasses, one ounce of salt-petre ; lay the hams in a 
clean dry tub ; heat the mixture and rub well into tl.e 
hams, especially around the bones and recesses ; repeat 
the process once or twice, until all the mixture ia 
used ; then let the hams lie two or three days, when 
they must be put for three weeks in brine strong enough 
to bear an egg ; then soak eight hours in cold water ; 
hang up to dry in the kitchen or other more convenient 
place for a week or more ; smoke from three to five 
(Uys, being careful not to heat the hams. Com cobs

SAUCES FOR MEAT OR FISH. 



DRAWN BUTTER. 

Drawn butter forms the basis of most sauces. From 
iliis a great variety may be made, by adding to this dif- 
ferent flavours — anchovies, ochra, onions, celery, par- 
sley, mint, and relishes — using those Havoxirs, which are 
suitable for the meat, game, or fish, with which the sauces 
are to be served. A good standard receipt for drawn but- 
ter b» as follows : 

Rub one tablespoon of flour with one-quart«r of a 
pound of butter ; when well mixed, put in a saucepan 
with a tablespoon of milk or water ; set in a dish of 
boiling water, shaking it well until the butter melts and 
is near boiling. It should not be set directly on the 
stove or over the coals, as the beat will make the butter 
oily and spoil it.

PICKLED PEACHEa 

Mn. a D. Howard. 

Take five pounds of brown sugar to one gallon of pure 
:ider vinegar ; boil it hard for thirty minutes, skimming 
off the Bcum till clear; rub off the peaches in the mean- 
time out of boiling water (quickly) with a flannel cloth, 
sticking four cloves in each peaeh ; and put a bag of cin- 
namon into the boiling syrup. If the peaclics ar--' 
clingstones, put them into the boiling syrup for fifteei. 
or twenty minutes ; if freestones, lay them- in the jar in 
layers, and pour the syrup over them while hot ; then 
put a small plate over to keep them from rising, and 
cover tightly with cloth or paper. In four days look at 
them, and if necessary, boil the syrup again, and pour 
on while hot ; keep them in a cool place while the 
weather is hot to prevent their souring. The White 
Sugar Cling is nice for pickling, and the Blood Peach i^ 
very rich, but dark. Small pears can Ix) picklfsd in ih^ 
■ame manner, if the skin is taken oS.

After cutting off all the green leaves, put the cauli- 
flower into boiling water, with a good supply of salt, 
and boil from three to five minutes ; take them out of 
the salt and water, dip them in clear cold water one 
minute to send the heat to the heart of the cauliflower,

SPICED TOMATOEa 

Mn. Stotesboiy. 



To four pounds of large red tomatoes, take two pounds 
of good brown sugar, one pint of cider vinegar, half ounce 
of cloves, and half ounce of stick cinnamon ; stew 
all together in a preserving kettle until the tomatoes are 
C'M.ked ; take the tomatoes out and put them on dishes 
to cool, letting the syrup go on simmering slowly ; when 
the tomatoes are cold return them to the syrup for a little 
while ; let them become cold before putting them in the 
iars. The syrup must be boiled down as thick as 
molasses, and poured cold over the tomatoes ; tie them 
iown with bladder or waxed paper. 

PICKLED CUCUMBERa 

Mn. Packard. 

Wash with care your cucumbers, and place in jars, 
^tike a weak brine (a handful of salt to a gallon and a 
half of water). When scalding hot, turn over the cucum- 
bers and cover ; repeat this process three mornings in 
" n, taking care to skim thoroughly. On the 
ly have ready a porcelain kettle of vinegar, to 
which has been added a piece of alum the size of a wal- 
nut When scalding hot, put in as many cucumbers as 
tuay be covered with the vinegar ; do not let them boil, 
but skim off as soon as scalded through, and replace 
with others, lulding each time a small piece of alum. 
Wlnm thia process is through, throw out the vinegar and 
replac- with good cider or white wine vinegar; a<id 
spices, mavtard Bee<l, and red peppers. Sort ihu picklea

and place in stone or glass jars, turn over the hot spiced 
vinegar ; seal and put away the jars not needed for 
immediate use. Pickles thus prepared are fine and crisp 
at the expiration of a year. Those that are kept in open- 
mouth jars may be covered with a cloth, which will need 
to be taken off and rinsed occasionally. I prefer green 
peppers, and prepare them with cucumbers in brine. 
They are not as apt to become soft. 

DRESSING SALAD. 

Mrs. Riley. 

In dressing salad it should be thoroughly saturated 
with oil, and seasoned with salt and pepper before vin- 
egar is added. The salt should not be dissolved in the 
vinegar but in the oil, by which means it is more equally 
distributed through the salad. 

CUCUMBERS FOR PRESENT USE. 

Mra. Riley. 

Jhe best way of utilising cucumbers for 'present use 
is to parboil them in a solution of water, vinegar, and 
salt. They should be split in two before boiling, and, 
if done properly, will present a beautiful green colour. 

TOMATO MUSTARD.

to have the flour in lumps. If it is to be used with fish, 
put in chopped eggs and nasturtium, or capers. If used 
with boiled fowl, put in oysters while it is simmering, 
and let them heat through. 

BURNT BUTTER FOR FISH OR EGGS. 

MisB Beaty.

ounces of pepper and two nutmegs. Boil haK an hour, 
then add a pint of wine. 

CURRIED DISHES. 

Miss Beaty. 

Chickens and veal are most suitable for curries. Boil 
the meat till tender, and separate the joint. Put a 
little butter in a stew-pan with the chickens, pour on a 
part of the liquor in which the meat was boiled, enough 
U> covei' it and let it stew twenty minutes more. Pre-

minutes longer. Spice to suit the taste with cloves and 
cinnamon.

is desired, take eight, but it is very nice without any)» 
four green peppers ; slice all, and put in layers, sprinkle 
on one cup of salt, and let them remain over night; 
in the morning press dry through a sieve, put it in a 
porcelain kettle and cover with vinegar ; add one cup of 
eugar, a tablespoon of each kind of spice ; put into a

then put them into a kettle to stew very gently in their 
own liquor ; boil them in good vinegar, with mace, cloves, 
and black pepper. 

TOMATOES WHOLE FOR WINTER USE, 

Mrs. J. Saulter. 

Fill a large stone jar with ripe tomatoes, then add a 
few whole cloves and a little sugar ; cover them well 
with one half cold vinegar and half water ; place a piece 
of flannel over the jar well down into the vinegar, then 
tie down with paper. I have kept tomatoes in this way 
the year round, and can cheerfully recommend them. 
Should mildew collect on the flannel it will not injure 
the tomatoes in the least. 

CHOW-CHOW. 

Mrs. John Corthell. 

Two heads cabbage, two heads cauliflower, one dozen 
cucumbers, six roots of celery, six peppers, one quart of 
small white onions, two quarts green tomatoes ; cut into

tender, then strain them. Two gallons of vinegar, one- 
fourth pound of mustard, one-fourth pound of mustard 
seed, one pot of French mustard, one ounce of cloves, 
two ounces of turmeric ; put the vinegar and spices into 
a kettle and let them come to a boil ; mix the vegetables 
and pour over the dressing.

PICKLED OYSTERa 

Mn. Carl Haminond. 

Wash the oysters and scald them in strong salt and 
w^ier ; skim them out and throw into cold water; scald 
vinegar well and whole peppers ; let it get cold. Put 
the oysters in a stone jar ; make liquor to cover them of 
water they were scalded in, and vinegar. A cup of vin- 
egar to one quart liquor, to be used cold. 

BRINE THAT PRESERVES BUTTER A YEAR 

M™. D. McCraney, 

To three gallons of brine, strong enough to bear an egg, 
add one-quarter pound good loaf sugar, and one tablespoon- 
f ul of saltpetre ; boil the brine, and when it is cold strain 
carefully. Pack butter closely in small jars, and allow the 
brine to cover the butter to the depth of at least four 
inches. This completely excludes the air. If practicable 
make your butter into small rolls, wrap each carefully 
in a clean muslin cloth, tying up with a string ; place a 
weight over the butter to keep it all submerged in the 
brijie. This mode is most recommended by those who 
have tried both.

VEAL STEW. 

Two pounds of veal steak cut in strips ; put in cold 
water in a skillet or spider and over the fire. The water 
should be just sufficient to cover the meat. Pare, wash 
and slice one small potato and put in with the meat. 
Stew for twenty or thirty minutes gently, taking care 
that the water does not boil* away. Ha,ve ready two or 
three eggs boiled in the shell. When the meat is tender 
add to the broth one cup of fresh milk and one heaping 
tablespoon of flour ^Yet with milk ; season all with butter, 
salt and pepper, and, if you like, a little parsley. Cut 
the hard .boiled eggs in slices and put into the broth. 
Let all boil up once, and serve with or without toast on 
the platter. A very nice breakfast dish. 

TO STEW MUSHROOMS. 

Miss Brokovski, 

Peel them and put them to stew in some milk till 
tender, when sufficiently done, put to them some butter 
and flour mixed together, a little cayenne, and some salt ; 
part cream instead of milk will improve them.

care that each is whole, and does not encroach upon the 
others so much as to mix or disturb the yolks ; sprinkle 
with pepper and salt, and put a bit of butter upon each. 
Put into an oven and bake until the whites are set. 
This is far superior to fried eggs, and very nice for 
breakfast, served on toast or alone. 

POACHED EGGS. 

Break as many eggs as you wish to use, one at a time, 
and drop carefully into a spider filled with boiling water. 
When the whites of the eggs are well set, slip a spoon 
carefully under and take out, laying each upon a small 
piece of buttered toast on the platter. Put a very small 
piece of butter on each egg, a slight dash of pepper, and 
serve immediately. 

OMELET— (SPLENDID).

BOILED POTATOES. 

Old potatoes are better for being peeled and put in 
cold water an hour before being put over to boil. They 
should then be put into fresh cold wat^r, when set over 
the fire. New potatoes should always be put into boiling 
water, and it is best to prepare them just in time for 
cooking. Are better steamed than boiled. 

MASHED POTATOES. 

Mrs. ¥. D. J. 

Peel the potatoes, and let them stand in cold water 
for half an hour ; then put in the steamer over boiling 
water and cook them until mealy and quite tender. Have 
ready an earthen basin, or a bright tin pan, into which 
you will put your potatoes, so that while mashing and 
preparing, they can be kept on the stove and hot. Now 
mash well and finely with the potatoe-masher, and then 
season with salt ; allow a generous piece of butter, and 
lastly, add a tea cup of rich milk ; mix altogether well, 
and then take up on a deep dish. 

There will now be three or four ways to finish this, 



156 THE HOM£ COOK BOOK. 

and which are, first by putting a little butter on the top, 
after smoothing nicely, and putting it a moment at the 
mouth of the oven, and then serving quite hot ; or you 
may put it into the oven, which should be quick and hot, 
and bake the crust of a rich brown. Or, again, the top 
may be scored a golden brown with steel bars made for 
this purpose. Or, lastly, after mashing the potato, put 
it into a mould and shape it ; then loosen it from the 
mould and turn it on to a flat* piece of sheet iron, large 
enough to cover the bottom of the mould with handles 
at the sides. Then have ready hot lard in which you 
immerse the moujded potato and fry a rich golden brown. 
Take oiit and with a knife under, slide carefully on your 
platter. Garnish the dish around with curled parsley 
leaves. If the potato is put in the oven to brown, it. 
should be put in a baking plate and may be sent to the 
table in the dish in which it is baked, with a knitted 
cover over.

POTATOES FRIED. 

Mn. A. 



Pare potatoes ; cut in pieces one-half inch wide, and 
as long as the potato ; keep them in cold water till 
wanted ; drop in boiling lard ; when nearly done, take 
them out with a skimmer and drain them ; boil up the 
lard again, and drop them back, and fry till done ; this 
makes them puflT up ; sprinkle with salt and serve very 
hot. 

POTATO CROQUETTES. 

Take finely mashed potato and mix through it sufHcient 
salt, pepper, and butter to season well, with sweet milk 
or cream to moisten; mix thoroughly with this one 
beaten egg, and then make up into small rolls, being 
careful to have the surface perfectly smooth. Have 
ready one plate with a beaten egg upon it, and another

SOUTHERN WAY OF BOILING RICK 

Mn. Stotesbory. 

Pick over the rice ; rinse it in cold water until perfectly 
clean, then put it in a pot of boiling water, allowing a 
quart of water to less than a teacup of rice ; boil it hard 
seventeen minutes ; drain off the water very close, and 
let it steam fifteen minutes with the lid off. When care- 
fully done in this way, each kernel of rice stands out by 
itself, while it is perfectly tender. The water in which 
the rice has been boiled makes, it is said, good starch fof 
muslin, if boiled a few minutes by iUielf.

BAKINQ POWDEJt. 165 

BAKING POWDER 



Is A :;X\ wiience which the chemistry of the nineteenth 
century ba? given to the cook ; its uses are indicated in 
the followi;iJt pages ; a question is sometimes asked as to 
the healtSil"uL\oss of Baking Powder, it may be replied 
that a gotxi Ci«dm Tartar baking powder will, not only 
not injurt» the ii\ost delicate constitution, but may prove 
in many cases highly beneficial, whilst those in which 
Lime phosphates And Alum are used should be avoided. 

To be certain oi its comjiositionthe cook might pre] are 
her own baking p<r>vder ; it is, however, confessedly diffi- 
cult to obtain pure ingredients for this pui-pose at retail, 
no article being more generally found adulterated than 
Cream of Tartar, \% is, therefore, safest to purchase the 
powder of a respectable maker who procures his supplies 
on a large scale, fiorn places of production, and can test 
their purity. 

In using baking powder, the proper proportion should, 
in every case, be naxed intimately and uniformly with 
the dry flour, if shoiiening is to be used, it, also, should 
be mixed with the flour before wetting, the best powdera 

f'lve ample time for kneading, etc., but some — those using 
artarie Acid for insu^nce — require expeditious use, else 
their etfec-t will be losL from the too rapid production of 
gas. 

Unlike yeast, which changes to some extent the nature 
of all the flour used in a batch, and entirely destroys a 
portion of it, for the production of gas, baking powder 
leaves the flour quite unchanged, there is, therefore, no 
danger from \east spores, which may have escaped alive 
from insufficient baking, obtaining access t« the stomach ; 
these latter are the cause of pains and eructations which 
fre«iuently follow the use ot warm yeast bread.

DISHES FOR DESSERT, 



SNOW DRIFTS. 

Mrs. S. McMaster. 

Half g^ox of gelatine, one pint of boiling water, juice 
of two lemons, two cups of sugar, whites of five eggs ; 
dissolve the gelatine in the water ; add the lemon and 
sugar mixed together ; put in mould to cool ; when cool, 
but not cold, take the whites of the eggs beaten still' 
sweetened and flavoured, and float them on boilina: milk 
for about one minute. Now take the gelatine from your 
mould (instantly place the mould in cold water), and 
with a fork, beat up the gelatine that has become firm 
into hits, but not into liquid. Now take your mould and 
add spoon about of the broken up jelly and the whites of 
eggs, filling up the mould with the jelly that became soft 
in spite of you ; place to cool. Serve on a dish sur- 
rounded by a custafd made from the yolks of the eggs 
and one more ; one pint of milk, 

MACEDOINE OF FRUIT.

A NICE DESSERT DISH. 

Mrs. J. Thomey. 

Fill a quart bowl with alternate layers of thinly sliced 
apples and sugar, and add half a cup of water, covered 
with a saucer, held in place by a weight ; bake slowly 
three hours ; let it stand until cold, and you will tarn 
out a round mass of clear red slices, imbedded in firm 
jelly. For an accompaniment to a dessert of blano 
mange, rennet custard, cold rice pudding, or similar dishes, 
or even with nice bread and butter, there is nothing 
better. 

AN EXCELLENT DESSERT.

FRUITS. 



" Fruit of all kinds, in ooat 
RoQgli, or smooth rind, or bearded husk, or shell. 
She gathers tribute large, and on the board 
Heaps with unsparing hand." 

— PABA.DISX Lorn. 

Bring me berries or such cooling fruit 
As the kind, hospitable woods provide. 

— COWPBB. 

Fruit for preserving should be carefully selected 
removing all that are imperfect. They are in the best 
condition when not fully ripe, and as soon as possible 
after they are picked. Small fruit should not be 
allowed to stand over night after they are picked when 
they are to be preserved. Use only the finest sugar for 
preserving. When fruit is sealed in glass cans, wrap 
paper of two or three thicknesses around the cans. The 
chemical action of light will affect the quality of the 
preserves when perfectly air-tight. With this precau- 
tion, glass cans are preferable to any other for preserv- 
ing fruit. One-half a pound of sugar to a pound of fruit 
is a good rule for canned fruit, although many house- 
keepers use but one-quarter of a pound of sugar to a 
pound of fruit. 

An excellent rule for canning the larger fruits, as 
peaches, pears, etc., is to place them in a steamer over 
a kettle of boiling water, laying first a cloth in the bot- 



YALUABLK RECIPEa 239 

torn of the steamer. Fill this with the fruit and cover 
tightly. Let them steam for fifteen minutes, or until 
they can be easily pierced with a fork (some fruits will 
require a longer time). Make a syrup of sugar of the right 
consistency. As the fruit is steamed, drop each for a 
moment in the syrup, then place in the cans, having 
each one half full of fruit, and then fill up with the hot 
«yrup, then cover and seal. 

A SUGGESTION. 

For canning all large fruits, where no other method 
is given by contributors, the directions for canning large 
fruits are given in the recipe for Preserved Peaches. 
For canning all of the small fruits, follow the directions 
given in Preserved Cherries. They are both excellent, 
If less sugar is preferred use pne-quarter of a pound of 
sugar to a pound of fruit. The syrup should be pre- 
pared by adding a pint of water in your preserving ket- 
tle to each pound and a-half of sugar ; let it boil up 
gently and skim until perfectly clear, when it is ready 
for the fruit. 

SUGARED FRUITS. 

Beat the white of the egg just enough to break, then 
dip fine stems of cherries or currants into the egg and 
then into powdered sugar, and dry on a sieve. 

BAKED APPLES. 

Pare as many apples as you wish of some nice variety, 
neither sweet nor sour ; core them by using an apple-

corer or a steel fork ; set them in biscuit tins and fill 
the cavities with sugar, a little butter, and some ground 
cinnamon, if you like ; set them in the oven and bake 
until done. 

BAKED PEATIS. 

Place in a stone jar, first a layer of pears (without part- 
ing) ; then a layer of sugar, then pears, and so on until 
the jar is full. Then put in as much water as it will 
hold. Bake in oven three hours, 

QUINCE PRESERVE. 

Mrs. BendelarL 

Pare, core, and quarter your fruit, then weigh, it and 
allow an equal quantity of white sugar. Take the peel- 
ings and cores and put in a preserving kettle ; cover 
them with water and boil for half an hour ; then strain 
through a hair sieve and put the juice back into the 
kettle and boil the quinces in it a little at a time until 
they are tender ; lift out as they are done with a drainer 
and lay on a dish ; if the liquid seems scarce add more 
water. When all are done throw in the sugar and allow 
it to boil ten minutes before putting in the quinces ; let 
them boil until they change colour, say one hour and a 
quarter, on a slow fire ; while they are boiling occasion- 
•ally slip a silver spoon under them to see that they do 
not burn, but on no account stir them. Have two fresh 
lemons cut in thin slices, and when the fruit is being put 
in jars lay a slice or two in each.

e dozen nice quinces, cored and well rubbed. Put 
in baking pans, and fill the centre with pulverized sugar. 
Bake and serve cold, with or without cieam. 

PRESERVED PEACHES. 

Select peaches of fine quality and firm. If too ripe 
they are not likely to keep perfectly. Pare them and 
place them in a steamer over boiling water and cover 
tightly ; an earthen plate placed in the steamer under 
the fruit will preserve the juices, which afterwards may 
be strained and added to the syrup. Let them steam 
for fifteen minutes or until they can be easily pierced 
with a fork ; make a syrup of the first quality of sugar, 
and as the fruit is steamed drop each peach into the 
sviup for a few seconds, then take out and place in the 
cans ; when the cans are full, pour over the fruit the hot 
syrup and seal immediately. Inexperienced house-wives 
will do well to remember that the syrup should be well 
kimmed before pouring over the fruit We prefer the 
proportions of half a pound of sugar to a pound of fruit 
for canning, although many excellent house-keepers use 
less. This rule is excellent for all of the laige fruits — 
as pears, quinces, apples, etc. 

PRESERVED PLUMS.

If prepared at tea time let them remain until morning » 
then strain the juice from the plums, boil and claiify it, 
Remove the fruit Carefully to glass or china jars, pour 
over the hot syrup and carefully cover with egg, tissue 
paper, or thick white paper pasted, or bladder tied 
closely down. 

PRESERVED PEARS. 

Mrs. Midgley. 

To six pounds of pears, four pounds of sugar, two 
coffee cups of water, the juice of two lemons, and the 
rind of one, a handful of whole ginger ; boil all together 
for twenty minutes, then put in your pears and boil till 
soft, say about a quarter of an hour ; take them out and 
boil your syrup a little longer ; then put back your fruit 
and give it a boil ; bottle whilst hot ; add a little cochi- 
neal to give them a nice colour. 

PRESERVED CHERRIES. 

Jennie June. 

Stone the fruit, weigh it, and for every pound take 
three-quarters of a pound of sugar. First dissolve the 
sugar in water in the proportion of a pint of water to a 
pound and a-half of sugar ; then add the fruit and let it 
boil as fast as possible for half an hour, till it begins to 
jelly. As soon as it thickens put in pots, cover with 
brandicd paper, next tljie fruit, and then cover closely 
from the air.

round of sugar to a pound of fruit ; after putting the 
fruit into the syrup let it scald, (not boil hard), for ten 
or fifteen minutes and then can and seal. A few of the 
cherry stones put in a raualin bag and put into the syrup 
to scald with the fruit imparts a fine flavour ; they 
should not be put in the jars with the fruit. This 
mothod is excellent for use with all the small fruits, as 
sti-awberriea, raspberries, and also plums.

keep tightening them up. 

CANNED STRAWBERRIES. 

Miss Blaikie. 

After the berries are pulled, let as many as can be put 
carefully in the preserve kettle at once, be placed on a 
platter. To each pound of fruit add three-fourths of a 
pound of sugar ; let them stand two or three hours, till 
the juice is drawn from them ; pour it in the kettle and 
let it come to a boil, and remove the scum which lises ; 
then put in the berries very caiefuUy. As soon as they

strain them through a colander ; turn them back to co ok 
and when they have come to boiling heat, pour them 
into stone jugs (one or two gallon jugs as you prefer). 
They will keep a day or two in winter if all are not used 
at a time ; put the cork in, and have some canning 
cement hot and pour over the cork. The jug must of 
course, be hot, when the tomatoes are poured in.

Mrs. J. Brown. 

Take green apples that will cook nicely ; quarter 
the apples without paring, put them in a pan or kettle 
and cover over with water, and keep them covered ; let 
them boil slowly until entirely done ; then put in a bag 
and drain (not squeeze) them. Put a pound of white 
sugar to a pint of juice. This is very easily made in the 
winter ; is best made day before using.

strain out the juice, and put a pound of white sugar to 
a pint of juice. Flavour to taste ; boil till a good 
jelly, then put into moulds. 

APPLE JELLY. 

Take seven pounds of ripe apples — such as are excel- 
lent boilers — and if the rind is red the colour of the jelly 
will be beautifully tinged ; cut the fruit in pieces, with- 
out peeling or extracting the cores, and only removing 
the stalks and the eyes ; add two quarts of water, and 
boil or bake till the whole is a pulp, which pour into a 
jelly bag, placed near the fire, (as the pulp thickens in 
cooling) ; add eight ounces of white or loaf sugar to each 
pint of the liquid, with the juice of a small lemon, and 
the peel cut very thin ; boil to a tolerably thick jelly, 
which may be ascertained by trying a little on a plate ; 
strain again through the bag or a piece of muslin, and 
run into moulds or pots. When cold lay a piece of tissue 
paper over, and put by in a dry place. This jelly wili 
keep two or three years.

well buttered ; set it on a table, and begin at the bot- 
tom and stick on to this frame with the sugar a row of 
macaroons, kisses, or other ornamental articles, and 
continue till the whole is covered. When cold draw out 
the pasteboard form and set the pyramid in the centre 
of the table with a small bit of wax candle burning with- 
in, and it looks very beautiful. 

CUSTARD JELLY. 

Make a boiled custard of one quart of fresh milk, three 
eggs, one teacup of sugar, two teaspopnsful of vanilla ; 
dissolve a-half box of gelatine in as little water as will 
cover it, and when well dissolved add the juice of one

lemons ; sugar to taste ; strain through muslin, and set 
in a cold place. When quite stiff, beat in the whites of 
four well beaten eggs, and then pour into moulds. It 
will make about a quart and a-half. This is very suit- 
able for invalids who cannot take wine, also an exceed- 
ingly ornamental jelly.

deep dish with four quarts of water ; let it stand thirty- 
six hours ; boil two hours, (water as well) ; then add 
eight pounds of crushed sugar ; boil one hour longer, or 
until you think it will jelly ; the addition of a wineglassful 
of spirits when nearly boiled has the effect of causing all 
impurities to rise to the surface, and clarifies the jelly. 

APPLE JELLY. 

Mrs. N. P. Inglehart. 

Take juicy apples, (Ramboes, if possible) ; take the 
stems and tops off, and wash them nicely, then cut up 
into quarters and put cold water upon them, just enough 
to cover them ; boil them soft, afterward strain them 
throvgh a jelly bag ; then take two pints at a time with 
two pounds of crushed sugar ; boil twenty minutes, then 
do the same with the other juice ; to be economical, pare 
and core the apples ; don't strain so close, but that you 
can, by adding a little more water, use the apples for 
sauce or pies.

three lemons, soak for one hour in a pint of cold water ; 
then add three pints boiling water, two pounds of white 
sugar, one pint of wine ; strain into moulds, and set out 
to cool. 

TO PRESERVE QUINCES. 

Mrs. W. Arthurs. 

Pare, core, and quarter a peck of quinces, then weigh 
them ; put the parings, cores, and seeds into a preserving 
kettle, cover them with water, and boil slowly for twenty 
minutes ; then strain them, put the water back, and 
put in the quinces, a few at a time, and simmer them 
gently until tender, say five to ten minutes ; lay them on 
a dish ; when all are done add the sugar and a little warm 
water. Let them boil for a few minutes until clear, then 
put in all the quinces and boil them without stirring 
until they become a clear garnet, which will be about 
one hour. Have ready two lemons sliced thin and seeds 
taken out ; put them in a few minutes before taking off 
the fire.

la the stems and put them on the stove in a stone 
jar, bruising them with a wooden spoon ; then, when 
warm, squeeze through a coarse cloth or flannel, and 
put the juice on in a new tin pan or porcelain kettle ; 
one quart of juice requires two pounds of sugar, or a 
pound to a pint ; boil fifteen minutes ; to be a nice 
colour the currants should not come in contact with 
iron spoons or tin dishes, unless new and bright ; should 
be made quickly. It never fails to jelly good if the cur- 
rants are not too ripe. The same method for jam, only 
do not strain the currants, but mash them well. Cur- 
rants should not be dead ripe for jelly or jam.

E. M. Walker. 

Boil six pounds of green unripe gooseberries in six 
pints of water (they must be well boiled, but not burst 
too much) ; pour them into a basin, and let them stand

twenty minutes ; then put in the citron and boil for one 
hour, or until tender ; before taking off the fire put in 
two lemons, sliced thin, seeds taken out, and two ounces 
of root ginger ; do not let them boil long after the lemon 
and ginger are put in ; do not stir them while boiling. 
Tlje above is very fine if carefully attended to. 

ARTIFICIAL HONEY.

Mix together ten pounds white sugar, two pounds 
clear bees' honey, one quart of hot water, half an ounce 
of cream tartar ; when cool flavour with two or three

GRAPE JAM, 

Mrs. S. W. Cheever. 

Take your grapes, separate the skin from the pulp 
keeping them in separate dishes, put the pulp in your 
preserving kettle with a teacup of water; when thorough- 
ly heated, run them through a colander to seperate the 
seeds ; then put your skins with them and weigh ; to

CANDY. 



** Sweets to th* Sweet* 



In order to understand the secret of candy making,^it 
will be necessary to understand the action of heat upon 
sugar. The first step in this process is the reduction of 
suu:ar to a syrup, which is done by adding water to 
sugar in the proportion of a pint and a-half of water to 
three and a-half pounds of sugar. When this boils up 
in the kettle we have simple syrup. A few more min- 
utes of boiling, reduces the water which holds the sugar 
in perfect solution. At this stage, if the syrup is al- 
lowed to cool, the candy crystallizes on the sides of the 
dish, and we have rock candy. If, instead of allowing 
it to cool at this point, we allow it to reach a higher de- 
gree of heat, we shall find, in putting a spoon into the 
syrup, when drawing it out a long thread of sugar 
will follow the spoon. It is to this point that confec- 
tioners bring the syrup for the greater number ot' can- 
dies produced. The greatest skill is required on the 
part of the operator to push the boiling sugar to this 
point without allowing it to reach the caramel state, 
when it becomes bitter and dark and is no longer fit to 
use as a confection. The proportion of sugar and water 
for candy making will be three and one-half pounds of 
sugar to ane and one-half pints of water. To this add 
one teaspoon of cream of tartar, which will pxevent the 



^ 



260 fHE HOME COOK BOOK. 

tendenc} of the sugar to assume tlie granular condition. 
To test the candy, drop into cold water. When this 
becomes at once hard and brittle the vessel should be at 
once removed from the fire. Flat sticks are formed by 
pouring the candy into long flat pans, and when cooling 
crease the mass, which will readily break into sticks 
when cold. To make round stick candy, when cool 
enough to handle and while warm enough to mould, roll 
into sticks with the hands. To colour candies, take 
small portions of the candy while cooling, and colour, 
then put together in strips and twist slightly. 

LEMON CANDY. 

Put into a kettle three and one-half pounds of sugar, 
one and one-half pints of water, and one teaspoon of 
cream of tartar. Let it boil until it becomes brittle 
when dropped in cold water ; when sufficiently done take 
off" the fire and pour in a shallow dish which has been 
greased with a little butter. When this has cooled so 
that it can be handled, add a teaspoon of tartaric acid 
and the same quantity of extract of lemon, and work 
them into the mass. The acid must be fine and free 
from lumps. Work this in until evenly distributed, and 
no more, as it will tend to destroy the transparency of 
the candy. This method may be used for preparing all 
other candies, as pine-apple, etc., using different 
flavours. 

CREAM CANDIES. 

Three and one-half pounds of sugar to one and one- 



YALDABLE RECIPES. 261 

half pints of water ; dissolve in the water before putting 
with the sngar one-quarter of an ounce of fine white 
gum arable, and when added to the sugar pat in one tea- 
spoon of cream of tartar. The candy should not be 
boiled quite to the brittle stage. The proper degree can 
be ascertained if, when a small skimmer is put in and 
taken out, when blowing through the holes of the skim- 
mer, the melted sugar is forced through in feathery 
filaments : remove from the fire at this point and rub the 
syrup against the sides of the dish with an iron spoon- 
If it is to be a chocolate candy, add two ounces of choco- 
late finely sifted and such flavouring as you prefer, 
vanilla, rose, or orange. If you wish to make cocoanut 
candy, add this while soft and stir until cold. 

EVERTON TOFFEE. 

Miss. Wyllie. 

Take one puund of treacle, the same quantity of moist 
sugar, half a pound of butter ; put them in a saucepan 
large enough to allow of fast boiling over a clear fire ; 
put in the butter first, and rub it well over the bottom 
of the saucepan, and add the treacle and sugar, stirring 
together gently with a knife; after it has boiled for 
about ten minutes ascertain if it is done by having 
ready a basin of cold water, and drop a little of the 
mixture into it from the point of a knife; if it is 
sufficiently done, when you take it from the water 
it will be quite crisp. Now prepare a large, shallow tin 
pan or dish rubbed all over with butter to prevent its 
adhering, and into this pour the toffee from the sauce- 
pan to get it cold, when it can be easily removed.

GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR MAKING BREAD 



la the composition of good brecod, there are three im- 
poi-tant requisites : Good flour, good yeast, and strength 
to knead it well Flour should be white and dry, cnimb- 
ling easily again after it is pressed in the hand. 

A very good method of ascertaining the quality of 
yeast will be to add a little flour to a very small quan- 
tity, setting it in a warm place. If in the course of ten 
or fifteen minutes it rises, it will do to use. 

When you make bread, first set the sponge with warm 
milk or water, keeping it in a warm place until quite 
light Then mould this sponge, by adding flour into 
one large loaf, kneading it well. Set this to rise again, 
and then when sufiiciently light mould it into smaller 
loaves, let it rise again, then bake. Care should be 
taken not to get the dough too stiff with flour ; it should 
be fts soft as it can be tc knead welL To make bread

or biscuits a nice colour, wet the dough over top with 
water just before putting into the oven. Flour should 
always be silted. 

YEAST. 

Mrs. E. S. Cheesebrough. 

Put two tablespoons of hops in a muslin bag and boil 
them in three quarts of water for a few minutes ; have 
ready a quart of hot mashed potatoes, put in one cup of 
flour, one tablespoon of sugar, one of salt ; pour over 
the mixture the boiling hop water, strain through a col- 
ander, put a pint or less of fresh baker's yeast, or two 
cakes of yeast in while it is warm, and set it in a warm 
place to rise. This yeast will keep three or four weeks, 
if set in a cool place. In making it from time to time, 
use a bowl of the same to raise the fresh with. 

YEAST. 

Mrs. Mary Ludlam. 

Six good potatoes grated raw, a little hop tea, one 
quart of boiling water, three-fourths cup of brown sugar^ 
one-half teaspoon of salt ; when cool, add yeast to rise '>

BEST BAKING POWDER. 

Mrs. Oliphant. 

Tartaric acid, four parts, by weight ; bicarbonate 
soda, live parts, by weight ; baked flour, nine parts, by 
weight. The flour should be absolutely dry. The tar- 
taric acid and the soda must also be dry, and pulverized

tar. When thus prepared sift all together repeatedly 
till perfectly mixed ; then put into well-corked bottles, 
and use two teaspoonsf ul to each pint of flour. 

BOSTON BROWN BREAD. 

Mrs. Oliphant. 

To make one loaf : — Rye meal unsifted, half a pint ; 
Indian meal sifted, one pint ; sour milk, one pint ; mo- 
lasses, half a gill. Add a teaspoonful of salt, one tea- 
spoonful of soda dissolved in a little hot water; stir 
well, put in a greaesd pan, let it rise one hour, and 
stejim four hours. 

SALT RISING BREAD. 

Mrs. Uphani. 

At supper time take one-fourth teaspoonful of salt, 
same of soda, and one teaspoonful of white sugar ; over 
this pour one teacupful of boiling water, and add one 
cupful of cold water ; stir in three dessertspoonfuls of 
Indian meal and flour enough to make a thick batter, 
and cover tightly. In cold weather place it where it 
will be warm all night In the morning place your 
bowl in a dish of water as hot as you can hold yourjinger 
in. Stir it often and thoroughly for an hour. Sift in a 
ten quart pan two-thirds full of flour, into it stir enough 
warm water, one tablespoonful of salt, and one-half tea- 
spoonful soda, to make a thin batter; then stir your 
yeasi in thoroughly and place in a warm place, where 
no draughts of cold air will reach it. Let it rise to the 
top of pan.

the mixture thickens like starch ; add one teacup of 
sugar, one-half cup of salt ; when sufficiently cool, one 
cup of good yeast. Let it stand until a thick foam rises 
upon the top. Care must be taken not to bottle too 
soon, or the bottles may burst. Use one coffee cup of 
yeast to six loaves of bread. If kept in a cool place this 
yeast will last a long time, and housekeepers need not 
fear having sour bread.

SUGGESTIONS. 

lu aia.4Liiig Cake, it is very desirable that the materials 
be of the finest quality. Sweet, fresh butter, e^'gs and 
good flour are the first essentials. The process of put 
ting together is also quite an important feature, an. 
where other methods are not given in this work by con- 
tributors, it would be well for the young housekeeper to 
observe the toUowinjj direction : Never allow the butter 
to oil, but .soften it by putting it in a moderately warm 
place before you commence other preparations for your 
cake ; then put it into an earthen dish (tin, if not new 
will discolour your cake as you stir it), and add your 
sugar ; beat the butter and sufrar to a cream ; add tli 
yolks of the eggs, then the milk, and lastly the beatei 
whites of the eggs and flour. Spices and liquors ma\ 
be added after the yolks of the eggs are put in, and 
fruit should be put in with the flour. 

The oven should be pretty hot for small cakes, and 
moderate for larger. To ascertain if a large cake issufli- 




296 THE HOME COOK BOOK. 

ciently baked, pierce it with a broom-straw through the 
centre ; if done, the straw will come out free from dough *» 
if not done, dough will adhere to the straw. Take it out 
of the tin about fifteen minutes after it is taken from the 
oven (not sooner), and do not turn it over on the top to 

cool. 

ICING. 

The following rules should be observed where boiled 
icing is not used-: — 

Put the whites of your eggs in a shallow earthen dish, 
and allow, at least, a quarter of a pound or sixteen table- 
spoons of the finest white sugar for each egg. Take part 
of the sugar at first and sprinkle over the eggs ; beat them 
for about half an hour, stirring in gradually the rest of 
the sugar ; then add the flavour. If you use the juice of 
a lemon, allow more sugar. Tartaric acid and lemon juice 
whitens icing. It may be shaded a pretty pink with 
strawberry juice or cranberry syrup, or coloured yellow 
by putting the juice and rind of a lemon in a thick muslin 
bag and squeezing it hard into the eggs and sugar. 

If cake is well dredged with flour after baking, and 
then carefully wiped before the icing is put or, it will 
not run and can be spread more smoothly. Put frosting 
on to the cake in large spoonsful, commencing over the 
centre ; then spread it over the cake, using a large knife, 
dipping it occasionally in cold water. Dry the frosting 
on the cake in a cool, dry place. 

FROSTING.

One pint granulated sugar, moisten thoroughly with

w&ieT BuflScient to dissolve it when heated ; let it boil 
until it threads from the spoon, stirring often ; while the 
sugar is boiling, beat the whites of two eggs till they are 
firm ; then when thoroughly beaten, turn them into a 
deep dish, and when the sugar is boiled, turn it over the 
whites, beating all together x-apidly until of the right con- 
sistency to spread over the cake. Flavour with lemon if 
preferred. This is sufficient for two loaves. 

FROSTING FOR CAKE.

frosting than this.

When the water in the tea-kettle begins to boil, have

boiling water until the steeper is little more than half 
full ; cover tightly and let it stand where it will keep hot, 
but not boil. Let the tea infuse for ten or fifteen minutes, 
and then pour into the tea urn, adding more boiling 
water, in the proportion of one cup of water for every tea- 
spoon of dry tea which has been infused. Have boiling 
water in a water pot, and weaken each cup of tea as 
desired. Do not use water for tea that has boiled long. 
Spring water is best for tea, and filtered water next best.

MISCELLANEOUS. 



LIME WATER. 

Mrs. K C. Lynde. 

One of the most useful agents of household economy 
if rightly understood, is lime water. Its mode of prepa- 
ration is as follows : Put a stone of fresh unslacked lime 
ibant the size of a half-peck measure into a large stone 
jar or unpainte<l pail, and pour over it slowly and care- 
fully, (so as not to slacken too rapidly,) a tea-kettle full 
(four gallons,) of hot water, and stir thoroughly ; let it 
settle, «nd then stir again two or three times in twenty- 
four honrs. Then Ix^ttle carefully, all that can be poured 
off in a dear and limpid state. 

Uses. — It ia often sold by druggists as a remedy for 
children s rtummer complaints, a teaspoon being a dose in 
a cup of milk, and when diarrhoea is caused by acidity of 
the stomach- it is an excellent remedy, and when put into 
milk gives no unpleasant taste, but rather improves the 
flavour. 

When put into milk that might curdle when heated, 
it will prevent its so doing, and can then bo used for 
puddings and pies. A little stirred into cream or milk, 
after a hot day or night, will prevent its turning when 
used for tea or coffee. 

It is unequalled in cleansing bottles or sniai' milk 
ressels, or babies' nursing bottles, as it sweetens and 



^54 THE HOME COOK BOOK. 

purifies without leaving an unpleasant odour or flavour 
A cupful, jjr even more, mixed in the sponge of bread 
or cakes made over night, will prevent it from souring. 

PRESERVING AUTUMN LEAVES. 

Mrs. O. H. Wheeler. 

These may be easily preserved and retain their natural 
tints, or nearly so, by either of the following methods : 
As they are gathered they may be laid between the leaves 
of a magazine until the book is full, and left with a light 
weight upon them antill the moisture of the leaves has 
been absorbed ; two or three thicknesses of paper should 
intervene between the leaves. If the leaves are larore or 
in clusters, take newspapers, lay them on a shelf and use 
in the same manner as above. Then dip the leaves into 
melted wax (such as is used for moulding fruits, etc.,) into 
which you will have to put a few drops of turpentine and 
lay upon newspapers to harden perfectly. This will make 
the leaves pliable and natural, and gives sufficient gloss. 
Great care should be taken that the wax is of right tem- 
perature. This can be ascertained by the first leaf which 
is dipped in. Draw out gently over the pan both sides of 
the leai' and hold it up by the stem. If the wax is too 
hot the leaf will shrivel — if too cool it will harden in 
lumps on the leaf. 

Aiiother method is to iron each leaf with a middling 
hot iron until the moisture is all out of them. Are best 
without varnish. 

SKELETON LEAVES. 

Boil the leaves in equal parts of rain water and soft 
Boap until you can separate the pulp from the skin ; 



I 



vA. - .: RKcrrES. :>.».-) 

take them out into clear water ; lay the leaf to be cleaned 
on glass, the upper side of the leaf next to the glass ; 
then with a tooth brush remove all pulp and skin, turn 
the leaf and repeat the process ; when thoroughly done 
put the leaf to bleach in this solution : One pound sal 
soda, dissolved in five pints rain water ; one-half pound 
chloride of lirao. in three pints water ; allow twenty-four 
hours for the latter to dissolve. Strain out the sediment, 
and pour out the clear solution of lime into the solution 
of sal soda. The result will be a thick buttcr-niilk solu- 
tion, otherwise the lime was not strong enough. Filter 
this until it is perfectly clear. For leaves, use one part 
of solution to one part of water : for ferns, use the solu- 
tion full strength. When perfectly white, remove to clear 
water ; let stand for several hours, changing two or three 
times ; the last water should be a little blue ; tioat out on 
paper, press in books when nearly dry. In mounting use 
mucilage made of five parts of gum arable, three parts 
white sugar, two parts of starch ; add a very little water, 
boil and stir until thick and white. 



TO RESTORE FROZEN PI^VMrS. 

B. H. Knappb 

As soon as discorered, pour cold water over the plant, 
wetting every leaf thoroughly. In a few moments it 
will be crystallized with a thick costing of ice. In this 
state placo it in the dark, cjirefully covered with a news- 
pa|)er. The ice will slowly melt, leavii^i;: the plant in its 
original s£ate of health.

Mrs, Ludlam. 

Take one and one-half pounds of rock alum, pour on 
three pints of boiling water ; when quite cool put into a 
wide-mouthed vessel, hang in your grasses, a few at a

not support them. You may again heat alum and add 
more grasses. By adding a little colouring it will give 
variety.

it dissolve and just corae to a boil, stirring* with a stick ; 
then take half a pail of warm water, just the chill off,

For Cankkr Sore Mouth. — Burn a com cob and 
apply the avshes two or three times a day. 

Cure for Corns. — The strongest acetic acid, a[>plied 
night and morning, will cure haid or soft corns in a week. 

Ring Worm. — Put a penny into a tal»lcspoon of vine- 
gar ; let it remain until it becomes green, and wash the 
ring worm with this two or three times a day. 

Cuke for CniLBLAiNS. — Place red hot coals in a vessel, 
and throw upon them a Irani li'ul of corn meal ; hold the 
feet in the dense smoke, renewing the coals and meal, tiil 
the pain is relieved. This has been known to make very 
marked cuies when all other remedies have failed.

TooTnACTTE. — At a meeting of the London Medical

he was able to cure the most desperate case of toothache. 



VA- ■ - 873 

u..le.s8 the disease was connected with rlieuniatism, by the 
application of the following remedy : Alum reduced to an 
impalpable powder, two drachms ; nitrous spirits of ether, 
ceven drachma ; mix and apply to the tooth. Tried with 
success. 

Grease from Cloth. — Grease can be rein v-jJ Irom 
cloth by a paste of Fuller's earth and turpentine. This 
should be rubbed on the fabric until the turpentine has 
evaporated and awhile powder pioduced. The latter can 
be brushed off, and the grease will have disappeared. 

To Mend China. — Take a very thick solution of gum 
arable in water, and stir into it plaster of Paris until the 
mixture becomes of a proper consistency. Apply it with 
a brush to the fractured edges of the china, and stick 
them together. In three days the articles cannot be 
broken in the same place. The whiteness of the n. u.^i.t 
renders it doubly valuable. 

How TO Criii: a Bone Felon. — Of all painful things 
can there be any so excruciatingly painful as a bone 
felon ? We know of none that the flesh is heir to, and, 
as this malady is quite frequent and the subject of much 
earnest consideration, we give the latest recipe for its 
cure, wiiich is given by that high authority, the London 
Z^iticet : — " As soon as the pulsation which indicates the 
dirsea-se is felt, put directly over the spot a fly blister, 
about the size of your thumb nail, and let it remain for 
six hours, at the expiration of which time, directly under 
the snrface of the blister, may be seen the felon, which 
can be instantly taken out \r'*^ *i • point of a ir ' "" - f 
a lancet"

How TO GET RID OF Flies. — A clergyman, writing froM 
Ireland says : — " For three years I have lived in town, 
and during that time my sitting room has been fre« 
. from flies, three or four only walking about my break- 
fast table, while all my neighbours' rooms were crowded, 
I often congratulated myself on my escape, but never 
knew the reason of it until two days ago. I then had 
occassion to move my goods to another house, while I 
remained on for two days longer. Among other things 
moved were two boxes of geraniums and calceolarias, 
which stood in my window, the latter always being open 
to its full extent top and bottom. The boxes were not 
gone half an hour before my room was as full of flies 
as those around me. This, to me, is a new discovery, 
and perhaps it may serve to encourage others in that 
which is always a source of [)ieasure, and which now 
proves also to be a source of comfort, ", ."z., window 
gardening." 

Smallpox Remedy. — The following remedy a friend 
tried in Ohio in a case of confluent smallpox, when th« 
doctor had little hope of saving the patient, and it saved 
the woman's life. The remedy is. sure in i scarlet fever. 
" I herewith append a recipe which has been used to 
my own knowledge in a hundred cases. It will prevent 
or cure the smallpox, even though the ' pittings are 
filling. When Jenner discovered cow-pox in England, 
the world of science hurled an avalanche of fame upon 
his head, and when the most scientific school of medi- 
cine in the world (that of Paris), published this panacea 
for the smallpox it passed unheeded. It in unfailing

as fate, and conquers in every instance. It i^ hann]< 
when taken by a well person. It will also cure scarl 
fever. Take sulphate of zinc, one grain ; fox glo\ 
(digitalis), one grain ; half a teaspoon of water. When 
thoroughly mixed, add four ounces water. Take - 
spoonful every hour, and either disease will disappi^ 
in twelve hours. For a child, smaller doses, accordii 
to age." 

For Hydrophobia. — Franklin Dyer, a highly resp- 
table farmer of Galena, Kent County, Md., gives tliL- 
following as a sure cure for the bite of a mad dog. He 
has tested it with most gratifying results : Elecampa- 
is a plant well known and found in many gai'dens. Im- 
mediately after being bitten, take one and a-half ounces 
of the root of the plant, the green root is preferable. 
The dried, to be found in drug stores, will answer ; 
bruise it, put it in a pint of fresh milk, boil down to half 
a pint, strain, and when cold drink it, fasting at lea 
six hours afterwards. The next morning repeat the 
dose, fasting, using two ounces of the root. On iho 
third morning, take another dose prepared aa the la- 
and this will be sufficient After each dose, nothing 
b<» o«^*-en for at least six hours. I had a son who w 
Ditten by a mad dog eighteen years ago, and four otl.< : 
children in the neighbourhood were also bitten. Th. 
took the above, and are now alive and well. I ha\c 
known many who were cured. It is supposed that the 
jOot contains a principle, which, being taken up by tl 
blood in its circulation, counteracts or neutralizes tin.' 
deadly effect of the virus of hydrophobia. I feel so

much confidence in this simple remedy that T am willing? 
you should give my name in connection witli this 
statement. 

Fou Felon. — Take common rock salt, as used for salt- 
ing down pork or beef, dry in an oven, then pouml it 
fine and mix with spirits of turpentine in equal parts ; 
put it in a rag and wrap it around the parts affected ; 
a-s it gets dry put on more, and in twenty-four hours you 
are cured. The felon will be dead. No harm to try it, 
as I have with success. 

Cure for Neuralgia. — A friend who suffered horrible 
pains from neuralgia, hearing of a noted physician in 
Germany who invariably cured the disease, went to him, 
and was permanently cured after a short sojourn. The 
doctor gave bim the remedy, which was nothing but a 
poultice and tea made from our common field thistle. The 
leaves are macerated and used as a poultice on the parts 
afiected, while a small quantity of the same is boiled down 
to the proportion of a q«art to a pint, and a small wine 
glass of t he decoction drank before each meal. Our friend 
says he lias never known it to fail in giving relief, while 
in almost every case it has effected a cure. God gave 
herbs for the healing of the nations. 

Tincture of Iodine on Corns. — Dr. Bajis states that 
corns may be rapidly cured by the application of the 
Tincture of Iodine ; the corn disappearing in the course 
of a few days, if touched with the Tincture several times 
a day. If the corn be situated between the toes, it should 
be covered with a piece of linen steeped in a mixture of 
the Tincture and Glvcerine. — Mrs. C. Patterson. 



VALUABLE RECIPES. 

Flakklls for Fomentation. — Fold ihe riannel the 
size to tit over a pot of boiling water, and cover with a 
lid ; in a few minutes it will be hotter than if wrung oir 
of boiling water and yet dry at the corners ; roll it i 
covered, and convey quickly to the patient. — I. K 
GlLMOUR. 

For Hoarseness. — Squeeze the juice of half a lemon 
in a pint l)Owl, add loaf sugar (two tablespoons), one full 
tea-spoon of glycerine, and oue full tablespoon of whiske\ 
p«:»ur over this boiling hot water to nearly fill the bow 
aril Aiink hot just before going to bud. 

. .. ...... Throat. — Cut slices of salt pork or fa- 

bacon ; siianier a few liiouients in hot vinegar, and apj.i 
to throat as hot as possible. When this is taken off, ;. 
the throat is relieved, put aroun<l a bandage of soft tlannt- 
A gargle of equal parts of borax and alum, dissolved in 
water, is also excellent. To be used frequently. 

Healing Lotion. — One ounce glycerine, one ounce rose- 
water, ten drops carbolic acid. This preparation prevents 
and cures chapping of the skin, and at the same time 
bleaches it. It is also excellent for sore lips and gums. 1 
consider it an indisi>eus&ble adjunct to the toilet table. — 
Mrs. a. Yocum. 

To -. : _.Li:i;i)i.N(i. — A handful of flour bou: e

discoloured, replace by fresh ones. During any j»pidemic 
of skin diseases that are eruptive, onions, except those 
takeD fresh from the earth, are unsafe, as they are pecu- 
liarly sensitive to disease. 

To Restore from Stroke of Lightning, — Shower 
with cold water for two hours ; if the patient does not 
show signs of life, put salt in the water, and continue to 
shower an hour longer. 

For Toothache. — Of powdered alum and fine salt, 
equal quantities ; apply to the tooth and it will give 
speedy relief. — Mrs. Baetlett. 

For Headache. — Pour a few drops of ether on one 
half ounce of gum camphor and pulverize ; add to thi* 
an equal quantity of corbonate ammonia pulverized ; 
add twenty drops peppermint ; mix and put in an open- 
mouthed bottle and cork. — Mrs. A. M. Gibbs. 

Salve for Chilblains. — Fry out nicely a little mutton 
tallow ; into this, while melted, and after it is nicely 
strained, put an equal quantity of coal oil ; stir well 
together while it is cooling. 

To Remove Discolouration fbom Bruises. — Apply 
a cloth wrung out in very hot water, and renew frequently 
until the pain ceases. Or, apply raw beefsteak. 

■^ Cure for Wasp Sting. — Apply a poultice of saleratus 
water and flour, and bind on the sting. Apx>ly slices of 
raw onion for a bee sting. 

Cure for Summer Complaint. — Two ounces tincture 
rhubarb, one of paregoric, one-hal<^ "f easence of pepper-

mint, on*-half of essence of annis, one-half of prepared 
chalk. Dose for adult, one teaspoon in a little water ; 
take as often as needed — ^^R.s. L. BRADLEY. 

""^^^The best Deodorizer, — Use bromo-chloralura in the 
proportion of one tablespoon to eight of soft water ; dip 
cloths in this solution and hang in the rooms ; it will 
purify sick rooms of any foul smells. The surface of 
anythiqg may be purified by washinj^ well and then rub- 
bing over with a weakened solution of brorao-chloralura. 
A weak solution is excellent to rinse the mouth with 
often, when from any cause the breath is offensive. It 
is also an excellent wash for sores and wounds that have 
an offensive odour. 

To Destroy Bed Bugs. Moths, and Other Vermin. 
— Dissolve alum in hot water, making a very strong 
solution ; apply to furniture or crevices in the walls with 
paint brush. This is sure destruction to those noxious 
vermin, and invaluable because easily obtained, is perfect- 
ly safe to use, and leaves no unpleasant ti-aces behind. 
When you suspect^i^moths have lodged in the borders of 
carpets, wet the edges of the carpets with a strong 
Boiution ; whenever it reaches them, it is certain death. 

■** How TO Select Meats. — An English journal gives 
the following hints on this subject : — " Good and whole- 
some meat should be neither t-c a pale rosy or pink 
colour, nor of a deep purple. The first denotes the 
diseased condition, the last proves the animal has died 
a natural death. Gbod meat has more of a marble look,

ill consequence of the branching of the veins which 8ur« 
lound tlie adi[)o.se cells. The fat, especially of the inner 
urgans, is alvvay firm and suety, and never moi.'st, while 
in general the fat from diseased cattle is flabby and 
watery, juid iiiui-c often s jelly or boiled parch- 

ment. WlioJosome meat win aiways ehow itself firm and 
elastic to the touch, and exhibit no dampues.s, while 
diseasi'd meat will ap|»oar soft and moist, in fact often 
more wet, so that the liquid substances run out of the 
blood when pressed hard. Good meat has very little 
smell, while unsoiiiid meat lias a disai^^reeable, c"!laver- 
ous smell, and diliuses a certain medicinal odour. This 
can be distinctly proved by cutting the meat through 
with a knilc and smelling the blade, or pouring warm 
water o\er it. Lastly, bad meat has the peculiarity that 
it shrinks considerably in the boiling : wholsome meat 
rather swells, ana dois nut lose an ounce ia weight"
