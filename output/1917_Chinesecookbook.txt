Is This Book for You? 



To the person who is a thousand miles from a Chinese Restaurant. 
To he or she who would appreciate the opportunity and consider it a mat- 
ter of pride to be able by a little practice in the art of an unknown science, 
to treat their friends, and themselves, to some of these remarkably de- 
licious, fascinating, toothsome dishes. 

To the man, out in the woods, in camp, on shipboard, at the club, 
who feels that the connecting link to unalloyed happiness would be a good 
big dish of Chop Suey. To the persons who are fond of Chinese dishes, 
but unable to eat them with the same relish in a Chinese Restaurant as 
they could at home. 

To the woman who hears hubby talk about the dandy feed he had at 
the Chinese Restaurant, and who would welcome the chance to be able to 
treat him with the surprise of his life. 

To these people I open the door to the secrets of Chinese cookery, giv- 
ing them the methods herein used by the greatest Chinese Chefs in the 
world. By supplying you with the imported Chinese flavoring sauces and 
vegetables I make it possible for you to cook these foods in the ONLY 
GENUINE WAY. 

To these people I respectfully dedicate this little book, with the hope 
that now and then my efforts may be appreciated by the fellow in the 
woods, or the lady who loves to cook (and eat Chop Suey.)

pes can be purchased from the publisher of this book. An illustrated cat- 
alogue containing prices and descriptions of the various imported ingred- 
ients will se sent FREE for the asking.

CHINESE CHOP SUEY 

For Two Portions 
(Prepare all of these ingredients before starting to cook the Suey) 

1 POUND LEAN PORK (Sliced size and thickness of half 
dollar.) 

1 CUP SPANISH ONIONS (Sliced thin.) 
1 CUP CELERY (Sliced thin crosswise. Remove leaves.) 
1 CUP CHINESE MUSHROOMS (Soak in water until soft. 
Remove stems slice.) 

5 CHINESE WATER CHESTNUTS (Pare and slice thin.) 
1 TABLESPOONFUL CHINESE SALTY SAUCE. 
1 TABLESPOONFUL CHINESE SWEET SAUCE. 
3 DROPS SESAMUN OIL. 

1 TEASPOONFUL CORNSTARCH (Dissolved in a little 
water.) 

Cook in an iron kettle on a very high flame. 

Fry the pork until half done, using about a tablespoon- 
ful of lard, meat fryings or peanut oil. Add the onions and 
fry a few minutes longer; then add the celery, mushrooms, 
Chinese water chestnuts and salty sauce together. 

Cover with tight fitting lid and allow to cook in its own 
juices for about 8 to 10 minutes. Stir occasionally, adding 
water or soup stock (hot) if necessary to prevent burning. 

Then turn flame low and stir in thoroughly the Chinese 
sweet sauce, sesamun oil and corn starch, and it is ready to 
serve. Serve on oblong chop suey dish, and with it serve 
rice (cooked Chinese style) and Chinese tea. 

RICE (Cooked Chinese Style) , 

Wash a half pound of good quality head rice (Jap style 
rice will not cook properly in this manner) and cover with 
water. The depth of the water above the rice should be 
exactly the same depth as the rice. 

Boil fast, stir frequently until all of the water is absorb- 
ed by the rice, then cover with tight fitting lid and set on 
low flame (with asbestos pad between) for 30 minutes, and 
leave without stirring. 

NOTE — Careful attention should be directed to the size of the flame 
which is used during the 30 minutes. Understand that you are to have as 
much heat as the rice will stand, without stirring, at the same time with- 
out burning it.

ly. See page 5 for recipe for Yet Ca Mein. 

EGGS IN FO YOUNG STYLE. See page 5 for recipe 
for Eggs Fo Young. Fry 8 cakes from the amount of batter 
and serve two for each portion. Serve on the oblong flat 
Chop Suey dishes. 

CHINESE CHOP SUEY. See page 2 for instructions 
for cooking. Serve this course with a bowl of rice cooked 
Chinese style. Use the oblong Chop Suey dishes for serving. 

LI CHEE NUTS. This desert is served on any small 
fancy dish. 

CANTON OR OOLONG TEA. In steeping Chinese tea, 
allow it to steep considerably longer than ordinary tea, in 
fact, bringing it to a boil will not impair the flavor. A pot 
of this tea should be served with the first course. The small 
Chinese tea cups are used and individual Chinese tea pots 
(red earthenware) are the correct thing.
