THE INTRODUCTION 

This little series of books is a collection of tested and 
economical recipes for everyday foods that are obtainable 
everyivhere and suitable for any of the three meals of the 
day. These recipes are written in plain, everyday terms. 
They are not all original — the authors of many of them 
are unknown. They form just a little series of everyday 
books for everybody from everyiivhere. 

The World War gave every homemaker an opportunity 
to realize the difference between use and abuse of foods. 
For years we have wasted much of the bountiful supply of 
food produced by our country. Let us then not go back- 
ward, but let us go forward, bending every energy to make 
lasting the benefit in health and economy gained from a 
diet that not only eliminates extravagance and waste in 
buying and serving, but also affords greater variety. 

The recipes in this series call for flour, sugar, and butter. 
To conserve these three foods just as long as our country 
and the peoples of Europe need them is the loyal and 
patriotic duty of — not the other fellow — but you. 

Measurements 
All measurements should be accurate to insure success. 
A standard measuring cup is equal to }4 pint. 
All measures are leveled. 
For }4 spoon divide with knife lengthwise. 
For >^ spoon divide with knife crosswise. 
For J4 spoon divide with knife crosswise.

PEANUTS 

ORIGIN, USE, AND FOOD VALUE 

Name and origin. The peanut is known by many names : 
goober, goober pea, pindar, ground pea, and ground nut. 
It belongs to the pea family and has a decided nut flavor; 
hence its name, peanut. Just when and where peanuts 
were first cultivated is not known, but they are believed 
to have originated in tropical America. They were intro- 
duced into North America in the early days of coloniza- 
tion, but did not become of commercial importance until 
about 1870 and have been increasing in popularity ever 
since. 

Food value. Peanuts were first eaten only as a nut, 
but on account of their food value they have become part 
of our daily diet. They are wholesome, healthful, and 
appetizing. They are rich in oil and protein and may be 
used as a meat substitute. As compared with beans and 
peas, peanuts are richer in both protein and carbohydrates.
