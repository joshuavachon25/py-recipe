National Warning 



Herbert C. Hoover, head of Belgium Relief, after being expelled 
from Belgium by the Germans, spent several weeks studying the food 
situation in England, France and Italy. Before sailing to be President 
Wilson's food adviser he cabled to the American people on April twen- 
ty-first, 1917, the biggest piece of news that has come across the At- 
lantic since the war began. Here is what he said: 

"I feel it my duty to emphasize that the food situation is one of 
the utmost gravity, which, unless it is solved, may possibly result in 
the collapse of every thing we hold dear in civilization. 

"The total stock of food to-day available in the allied world i? 
simply not sufficient to last till September if America continues its 
present rate of consumption. We are now face to face with the result 
of last year's poor harvest, the diversion of man power from agricul- 
ture all over the world, the unavailing efforts of the European women 
to plant available fields fully, the isolation of Russia, the sinking of 
food ships and many other causes. 

"England, France and Italy are reducing consumption by drastic 
steps, but even with all this reduction they must have from us during 
the next three months more than twice as much food as we should have 
exported normally or than we can send if we consume as usual. 

EAT LESS — PLANT MORE. 

"The only hope of providing the deficiency is by the elimination 
of waste, and actual and rigorous self-sacrifice on the part of the 
American people. To carry the Allies over until the next harvest we 
must reduce our wheat consumption thirty per cent. This means that 
every man, woman and child must forego at least one loaf of wheat 
bread per week and eat something else or less generously. 

"More than seventy per cent of American homes already are 
places of thrift, economy and a clean plate. In the remaining thirty 
per cent no one can deny that there is profligate extravagance and 
waste. Temperance in entertainment, food and drink is likely to 
become no longer an ethical question among this class, but a grim 
imposition of war. 

"We must also plant everything and everywhere it will grow, or 
this time next year the food problem will be absolutely unsolvable 
and the world will face absolute starvation." 



Preface 



The object of this book is to supply in convenient form a con- 
densed compilation of the scientific and reliable facts on foods and the 
economical uses of foods from the best sources. A comprehensive 
treatment of any phase of the subject of foods has not been attempted. 
The aim has been to provide practical material in a usable form.

Food 



PART I. 



Food is that which taken into the body builds tissue or yields 
energy. 

The most healthful food is that which is best fitted to the needs 
of the user. 

The cheapest food is that which furnishes the largest amount of 
nutriment at the least cost. 

The best food is that which is both most healthful and cheapest. 

The value of food depends mainly upon its composition and di- 
gestibility. The composition is determined by chemical analysis. 

The most important kinds of compounds in foods are protein, 
fats, carbohydrates, mineral matter, water and refuse. 

The functions of these compounds in the food are to build and re- 
pair the various tissues of the body and to supply the heat and mus- 
cular energy. 

Digestion. 

"We live not upon what we eat but upon what we digest." 
Food must first go through a number of chemical changes by what is 
called digestion which prepares it to be absorbed, taken into the blood 
and lymph and carried to the parts of the body where it is needed. 
Digestion takes place in the alimentary canal, partly in the stomach 
but more in the intestine. 

Digestion is brought about by substances called ferments which 
are secreted by the digestive organs. Saliva in the mouth has the 
power of changing insoluble starches into soluble sugar, but as the 
food stays in the mouth only a short time, there is generally little 
chance for such action. Saliva, however, helps fit the food to be more 
easily worked on by the stomach. Gastric juice of the stomach acts 
upon protein, and the pancreatic juice of the intestine acts upon pro- 
tein, fats and carbohydrates. The action of all the ferments is aided 
by the fine division of the food by chewing and by the muscular con- 
tractions of the stomach and intestine. The parts of the food which 
the digestive juices can not dissolve escape digestion and are periodi- 
cally given off by the intestine. 

When finally the blood, supplied with the nutrients of the di- 
gested food and freighted with oxygen from the lungs, is pumped from 
the heart all over the body it is ready to furnish the organs and tis- 
sues with the materials and energy which they need for their peculiar 
functions; at the same time it carries away the waste which the ex- 
ercise of these functions has produced. It is a characteristic of living 
body tissue that it can choose the necessary materials from the blood 
and build them into its own structure. 



Digestibility of Food. 

All foods are not equally digestible with all people. Different 
persons are differently constituted with respect to the chemical changes 
which their food undergoes and the effect produced. It may be liter- 
ally true that "one man's meat is another man's poison." Most whole- 
some kinds of food are hurtful to some people. Sickness may be na- 
ture's evidence that certain food is unfit. Every person must learn from 
bis own experience what food agrees with him and what does not. 

It has been found that in the total food of an ordinary mixed diet, 
on the average, about 92 per cent of the protein, 95 per cent of the 
fats and 97 per cent of the carbohydrates are retained by the body. 
The digestibility of a given article of food depends upon the digestibil- 
ity of the different classes of nutrients and upon the relative propor- 
tion in which these nutrients occur. Different specimens of the same 
kind of food material differ in composition, digestibility and nutritive 
value. 

The Cooking of Food. 

The cooking of food has much to do with its nutritive value. 
Owing to mechanical conditions or other causes many articles of food 
which are quite unfit for nourishment when raw are very nutritious 
when cooked. It is a matter of common experience that a well-cooked 
food is wholesome and appetizing while the same material badly cooked 
is unpalatable. There are three chief purposes of cooking. The first is 
to change the mechanical condition so that the digestive juices can 
act upon the food more freely. Heating often changes the structure 
of foods very materially so that they are more easily chewed and 
more easily and thoroughly digested. The second is to make it more 
appetizing by improving the appearance or flavor, or both. Food which 
is attractive to the eye and taste quickens the flow of saliva and other 
digestive juices, and thus digestion is aided. The third is to kill by 
heat any disease germs, parasites or other dangerous matter, and ap- 
plies to both animal and vegetable foods. 

Heat properly applied to meat develops the pleasing taste and 
odor of extractives and softens and loosens the protein (gelatinoids) 
of the connective tissues and thus make^ the meat more tender. Ex- 
treme heat tends to coagulate and harden the albuminoids of the lean 
portions and weakens the flavor of extractives. Burned meat is both 
unpalatable and indigestible. 

Meat in cooking loses weight because of the escape of the juices, 
fat and water. The nutritive value of a meat soup depends upon the 
substances which are dissolved out of the meat, bones and gristle by 
the water. In ordinary meat broth the extractives and salts are agree- 
able and often valuable as stimulants but have little value as nutri- 
ment. 

The cooking of vegetables ruptures the walls of the tiny cells 
containing starch grains and makes them more soluble. Heat also 
caramelizes a portion of the carbohydrates and produces agreeable 
flavors. 



Foods prepared from flour are made more palatable and porous 
and are more easily broken up in the alimentary canal when cooked. 
Escaping steam, and carbon dioxide gas given off by baking powder or 
by the fermentation of yeast in the dough form tiny bubbles within 
thin walls of protein (gluten) of the flour thus assisting in the desired 
results from cooking. The albumen of eggs when beaten incloses air 
in bubbles which expand and the walls stiffen with heat and thus render 
the food porous, a.

Quality of Food. 

That food which is brought into the home shall be clean and of 
good quality is of the greatest importance. Vegetables and fruits 
should be grown and milk and other dairy products produced under 
proper conditions, and all food materials which pass through the 
manufacturer's or dealer's hands should reach the kitchen in a clean 
and wholesome condition. 

Since the passage of the National Pure Food and Drugs Act giving 
the United States Government authority to enforce stringent laws 
against adulteration and misbranding of foods which enter interstate 
commerce, and the more rigid enforcement of similar state laws, the 
matters of Quality, quantity and cleanliness are generally neglected by 
the buying public. Deception has been greatly decreased, yet the bur- 
den of selective and discriminating buying can not be removed from 
the shoulders of the family buyer. Cheaper brands and grades of all 
food products cost less because they are either inferior, have a lower 
cost in production or a less demand than the higher priced prod- 
ucts. For example: 1. The cheaper brand of canned tomatoes may 
contain less and greener pulp with more water than the higher priced 
brand. 2. The cheaper brands of coffee may not only be an inferior 
berry but cost less in production during the processes of roasting. 3. 
The quality and cost of production may be the same with a cheaper 
product where demand dictates the price; as is true with cracked rice 
compared with the whole grain or round steak as compared with more 
expensive cuts of meat. In many cases sanitation and service add 
slightly to the cost of certain types of products. The buyer needs a 
very discriminating and well balanced sense of true value to fully 
protect the health as well as the economic rights of the household. 

Public Eating Places. 

Legislation regarding the inspection and regulation of hotels, 
restaurants and other places where meals are served is in force only 
in certain cities. The matter is one concerning which the patronizing 
public has a right to full information. In general, carefully managed 
eating places welcome inspection of their kitchens and storerooms by 
visitors. Clean places should be patronized. Bakeries, markets, candy 
kitchens and other places where food is handled should likewise be 
under very careful scrutiny in all matters pertaining to the sanitary 

—9— 



handling of their respective products. The person who undertakes the 
manufacture, distribution or preparation of food needs not only a 
knowledge of his particular activity but a thorough understanding of 
all the requirements of sanitation and health in the care of food prod- 
ucts. Remedy in cases of ignorance and neglect is in the hands of 
patrons. 

Cleanliness of Food. 

Cleanliness should always be observed in the keeping, handling 
and serving of food. Every precaution should be taken to insure 
cleanliness for the sake of health and economy. It means not only 
absence of visible dirt but freedom from undesirable organisms, and 
from worms and other parasites. If food, raw or cooked, is kept in 
dirty places, peddled from dirty carts, prepared in dirty rooms and in 
dirty dishes or is exposed to foul air, disease germs and offensive and 
dangerous substances can easily get in. 

Bacteria in Food. 

Food and drink may be very dangerous sources of disease. Bac- 
teria of typhoid fever often find their way into drinking water, and 
those of typhoid and scarlet fever and diphtheria into milk, and bring 
sickness and death to large numbers of people. Great pains should 
be taken to know the sources of the food we eat and to know that the 
mediums through which this food has passed have been sanitary and 
that the necessary precauptions against the most dangerous diseases 
been taken. 

Parasites in Food. 

Food materials may also contain parasites, like tapeworms in 
beef, pork, and mutton, and trichina in pork, which are often injuri- 
ous and sometimes deadly in their effect. The danger is not confined 
to animal foods. Vegetables and fruits may become contaminated 
with the eggs of numerous parasites from the fertilizers which have 
been applied to the ground in gardens and orchards. Raw vegetables 
and fruits should be very thoroughly washed before serving. If the 
food is sufficiently heated in cooking all organisms are killed. 

Decomposition of Food. 

Sometimes food undergoes decomposition in which injurious 
chemical compounds, so-called ptomaines, are formed. Poisoning by 
cheese, ice cream, preserved fish, canned meats and the like has been 
caused in this way. The ptomaines often withstand the heat of cook- 
ing and other precautions should be taken to guard against the possible 
use of foods in which decay has set in. 

Molds of Food. 

Mold on bread, cheese and other foods is familiar to every house- 
wife. The spores (i. e. minute reproductive bodies) of the different 
varieties of mold are every where present and need only warmth and 
moisture to enable them to grow on many kinds of food. These or- 

—10— 



ganisms are always at work in damp cellars and in dark, damp cor- 
ners of rooms. They are borne on the feet of insects, skins of fruit 
and are flying in the air. They flourish best in foods piled close to- 
gether. To prevent them getting started absolute cleanliness is nec- 
essary. Fresh air, sunshine and whitewash are important aids. Avoid 
dampness. Cellars may be kept dry by providing a quantity of un- 
slacked lime. The growth of all forms of fungi is also prevented by 
low temperature. 

Flies and Food 

The common house fly carries disease germs. It breeds in man- 
ure. It feeds on the sputum of diseased throats and lungs, typhoid 
dejecta, and refuse of all kinds. Germs are carried on its hairy feet 
and legs. By recent experiments with animals the bacilli of tuber- 
culosis and typhoid have given the disease within fifteen days. The 
eggs of worms taken in with food remain alive and hatch after be- 
ing ejected in the "specks." The remedy proposed is strict enforce- 
ment of the laws governing the cleaning of streets and the covering 
of all manure pits in town and country, with occasional spraying 
with crude petroleum. All means of prevention of the fly in the home 
should be used. 

The mosquito also carries disease. Two varieties are conceded to 
be necessary to the transmission, respectively, of malaria and yellow 
fever. The micro-organism of yellow fever is taken into the body 
of a mosquito and after twelve days it can convey the disease by biting. 
This "intermediary host" is successful fought only by exterminating 
the breeding places and by screening the home. 

The Bureau of Entomology of the Department of Agriculture 
has given a great deal of attention to the above subjects and the 
publications of the Bureau should be consulted for full data. a.

Dust and Food 

Dust is a little of everything. Air and dust bacteria are not 
necessarily harmful but may have among them those which produce 
disease. Dr. Michael Prudden gives the results of attempts to count 
the bacteria in the dust of New York streets. A culture plate of three 
and one-half inches in diameter was exposed for five minutes with 
the following results: Central Park, near street, collected 4 99 bacter- 
ia; Union Square, collected 214 bacteria; a large dry goods store, 
collected 199 bacteria; and a street while being swept collected 5,810 
bacteria. 

It has been found that molds, yeasts and bacteria are carried 
into the air by sweeping in the home. In no event should food and 
dishes be exposed so that the particles from the air can settle upon 
them. Dusting should be done with a damp cloth. A feather duster 
scatters micro-organisms in the air. Modern cleaning devices have a 

— 11— 



\/ 



great sanitary advantage. It is obvious that the floors of kitchen, 
dining room and pantry should be kept well washed. 

Pet Animals and Food 

The fur of even the most cleanly cats and dogs kept in the home 
may come in contact with the food. Of all rooms they should be kept 
from the kitchen. 

(Mice should in no case be tolerated in the home. The chances 
for infection from contagious diseases are too great, to say nothing 
of their ravages in destruction and waste. Data summarized by the 
New York State board of health shows the rat to be a factor in trans- 
mitting diphtheria and other diseases. Their destructiveness is incalcu- 
lable.) 

Common Elements of Food. 



The chemical elements which contribute in food most abund- 
ently to the body are oxygen, hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, calcium, 
phosphorus and sulphur. These elements form a great variety of com- 
pounds as already stated, are: Protein, fats, carbohydrates, mineral 
matter, water and refuse. . y 

Compounds in Foods 

1. PROTEIN. Protein forms about 18 per cent, by weight, of 
the body of the average man. Protein compounds may be sub- 
divided into albuminoids, gelatinoids and extractives. 

Albuminoids include substances similar to the white of eggs, 
the lean of meat (myosin), the curd of milk (casein), and the 
gluten of wheat. 

Gelatinoids occur principally in the connective tissues, such as 
the collagen of the tendons and skin and the ossein of bone. 

Albuminoids and gelatinoids, classed together as proteids (a), 
are most important constituents of our food. They make the basis of 
bone, muscle and other tissues and are essential to the body struct- 
ure. They are also used as fuel — that is, they are burned in the body 
to make energy and also to some extent are transformed into fat and 
stored in the body. 

(a). The terminology here followed is that recommended by 
the American Association of Agricultural Colleges and Experiment 
Stations. 

EXTRACTIVES are included with the protein compounds be- 
cause they contain nitrogen, but they differ greatly from the albumin- 
oids and gelatinoids. They are the principal ingredients of meat ex- 
tracts, beef tea, etc. They chiefly act as stimulants and appetizers. 

The digestion of proteins begins in the stomach and is completed 
in the intestine. 

Examples of protein foods are: Milk, peas, beans, cheese, oatmeal, 
nuts, meat, fish, eggs. 

2. FATS. Fats form about 15 per cent, by weight, of the body 

—12— 



of the average man. They occur chiefly in animal foods, such as meats, 
fish, butter, etc. Also they are abundant in some vegetable prod- 
ucts, such as olives, cottonseed, some cereals, notably oatmeal and 
maize, and in nuts. Fat is stored under the skin and scattered in 
minute particles through the various tissues. It gives warmth and 
energy in a concentrated form. Its digestion takes place chiefly in 
the intestine. 

Example of fat foods are: Butter, cream, egg yolks, meat fats, 
vegetable oils, nuts, cottonseed oil, olive oil, oat meal. 

3. CARBOHYDRATES. Carbohydrates constitute only a small 

portion of body tissues — less than one per cent. They are found chiefly 
in the vegetable foods like cereal grains and potatoes; also in milk in 
the form of milk sugar. They are very important because they form 
an abundant source of energy and are easily digested. Digestion begins 
in the mouth with the action of saliva on starch which is changed to 
a more soluble substance, dextrine, after reaching the stomach. 
Digestion is completed in the intestine. Carbohydrates are subdivided 
into two classes — starches and sugars. 

Examples of carbohydrate food are: STARCHES — cereals, pota- 
toes, rice, vegetables, fruits, milk;. SUGARS — Sugar, honey, mo- 
lasses. 

4. MINERALS. Minerals form about 5 or 6 per cent, by 
weight, of the body of the average man. They are found chiefly 
in the bones and teeth, and also found in solution in the various 
fluids and are in the tissues. Minerals are necessary in building the 
nerves and aid in producing the red corpuscles in the blood. 

Sources of mineral foods are: Milk, fresh fruits, whole cereals, 
green vegetables, egg yolks, cod fish, salt, raisins, dates, prunes. 

5. WATER. Water forms about 60 per cent, by weight, of 
the body of the average man. It is a component part of all the tis- 
sues. Water helps make the blood, equalizes bodily temperature, aids 
in moistening the joints and acts as a carrier of waste from the 
body. As it can not be burned it yields no heat or energy to the body. 

Sources of water in food are: Beverages, fresh fruits, fresh 
vegetables. 

_ Refuse in Food 

Food contains some materials which we can not or do not eat. 
Refuse is made up of all the other compounds of food and con- 
stitutes an important item when we consider the actual cost and nu- 
triment in food. Thus bones are largely mineral matter, with some 
fat and protein. Egg shells are almost all mineral matter. In some 
cases edible materials are classed as refuse altho they have a high 
nutritive value. Vegetable materials such as bran, potato and apple 
peelings have a number of the important ingredients of food and are 
generally among food wastes.

JSuch vegetables as potatoes, squash, beets, etc., have a certain amount of in- 
edible material, skin, seeds, etc. The amount varies with the method of preparing 
the vegetables, and can not be accurately estimated. The figures given for refuse of 
vegetables, fruits, etc., are assumed to represent approximately the amount of refuse 
in these foods as ordinarily prepared. 

•Fruits contain a certain proportion of inedible materials, as skin, seeds, etc., 
which are properly classed as refuse. In some fruits, as oranges and prunes, the 
amount rejected in eating is practically the same as refuse. In others, as apples 
and pears, more or less of the edible material is ordinarily rejected with the skin 
and seeds and other inedible portions. The edible material which is thus thrown 
away, and should properly be classed with the waste, is here classed with the refuse. 
The figures for refuse here given represent, as nearly as can be ascertained, the 
quantities ordinarily rejected.

tThe average of five analyses of cereal coffee grain is: Water 6.2, protein 13.3, 
fat 3.4, carbohydrates 2.6, and ash 4.5 per cent. Only a portion of the nutrients, 
however, enter into the infusion. The average in the table represents the available 
nutrients in the beverage. Infusion of genuine coffee and of tea like the above 
contain practically no nutrients. 

JMilk and shell. 

Nonnutrients in Foods 

A careful study of the composition of foods from Table 1. is 
important. In considering the food and economic value of food ma- 
terials it is necessary to note the proportions of non-nutrients, i. e., re- 
fuse and v/ater. The skin and bones of meat, and fish, the skin or 
rind and seeds of vegetables lessen the proportion of nutrients. Re- 
fuse is not commonly found among the dairy products, dried veget 1 
tables, cereal foods and foods prepared from them. Water constitutes 
a large proportion of even the solid foods. Beans, peas, meals, flour, 
cereal breakfast foods, etc., contain, roughly speaking, 10 to 12 per 
cent of water. 4 to 50 per cent of the ordinary cuts of meats are 
water and it is abundant in the flesh of lean animals, and tends to 
decrease as fats increase and vice versa. Fresh vegetables and fruits 
contain some times as much as 80 to 90 per cent of water. 

Many cooked foods contain more water than the raw material 
from which they are made owing to the water added in cooking. 
Thin soups are little more than flavored and colored water. In some 
cooked foods, notably meats, which have been baked, roasted or 
fried, the amount of water is diminished by cooking. 

Nutrients in Food 

The most important of the actual nutrients is protein. It is 
most abundant in the animal foods, legumes (peas and beans), and 
in smaller proportions in the cereals. Fats occur chiefly in the 
animal foods. Carbohydrates are found almost exclusively in the 
vegetable products and milk. Small quantities of minerals are found 



-17— 



in all foods. The most water and refuse are found in meat, fish, 
milk, fresh vegetables and fruits. 

Actual Values in Food Materials 

The market price of food materials is not regulated by their 
actual value for nutriment. 

An ounce of protein or fat from the tenderloin of beef is no 
more nutritious than that from a round or shoulder, but it costs 
considerably more. 

The agreeableness of food to the palate or fancy of the buyer is 
a great factor in deciding current demand and consequent selling 
prices. 

Animal foods, such as meats, fish, milk, and cheese gratify the 
palate as many vegetables do not. Furthermore, they satisfy the 
need of supplying protein and fats in which the vegetable foods, ex- 
cepting leguminous seeds and cereal grains, are lacking. Also animal 
foods are in general more easily digested, especially as regards pro- 
tein, and consequently cheaper for the same quantity of nutritive 
material. 

Ready prepared foods are justly higher in price owing to the 
expense in time, labor and facilities in the process of preparation 
for eating. They provide convenience in preparaton for serving, are 
generally palatable and furnish a pleasing variety. Prepared foods 
may contain greater nutritive value per bulk or weight than the 
same materials in the natural state owing to condensation by evap- 
oration in the processes of preparation. 

Since the cost of food is the principal item in the living ex- 
penses of most people, and the physicial welfare of all is dependent 
upon diet it is specially important that we have clear ideas regard- 
ing the nourishment to be gotten from the different food materials. To 
economize we must know the combinations which are best fitted 
for nourishment and have definite information as to the relation be- 
tween the nutritive values of the different foods and the expense 
in getting and preparing them. 

Among the different food materials which are palatable, nutritious 
and otherwise suited for nourishment we must know which ones furnish 
the largest amounts of available nutriments at the lowest cost. It 
is therefore necessary to take into account not only the prices per 
pound, quart or bushel of the different materials but also the kinds 
and amounts of the actual nutrients they contain, together with 
their fitness to meet the demands of the body. The cheapest food is 
that which supplies the most nutriment for the least money. The 
most economical food is that which is both cheapest and best adapted 
to the needs of the user. 

Adaptation of Foods 

All persons are alike in that they must have protein for the 
building and repair of the bodily machine and fuel ingredients for 
warmth and work, but individuals differ in the amounts and propor- 

—18— 



tions they require, and even among those in good health there are 
many who are obliged to avoid certain kinds of food, while invalids 
and people with weak digestion must often have special diet. 

For guidance in the selection of food nature provides us with 
instinct, taste and experience. Physiological chemistry adds the 
knowledge of the composition of food and the processes in nutrition. 
The following rules should be observed in the regulation of the 
diet for people in good health and with good digestion: 

1. Choose the things which "agree" with you and avoid those 
which can not digest and be assimilated. 

2. Use such kinds and amounts of food as will supply all the 
nutrients the body needs without burdening the digestive organs. 

3. Do not allow your appetite to overrule reason and the teach- 
ings of experience. 

4. Use the ordinary food materials — flour, meal, potatoes, milk, 
butter, cheese, sugar, fish and meat — in the proportions fitted to the 
actual needs of the body. 

5. Over-eating results in over-taxed digestive organs, wasted 
energy, general debility and possibly fatty tissue and actual disease. 

Advantage of Several Meals a Day 

A definite amount of food materials is necessary to provide the 
body of each person with tissue, energy and heat. It is better to furn- 
ish the food materials at three ordinary meals than at two hearty 
meals. Moderate quantities of food taken at moderate intervals are 
more easily and completely digested than large quantities at long 
intervals. The universal custom of three meals per day based upon 
instinct and experience indicates the wisdom. 

A General Plan for a Day's Menu

A general plan showing foods suited to each day's menu is given 
as follows: 

BREAKFAST PLAN 
1. Fruit.

3. Some kind of bread. 

4. A hot drink. 

5. (Some tissue building food as eggs, or meat or fish if so 
desired.)

5. One kind of preserves or jelly if so desired. 

Meal-Planning 

(From Cornell Reading Courses) 

Although the best type of meal-planning must be based on a 
thorough knowledge of human nutrition, much may be accomplished 
by an understanding of a few simple dietary rules. Although by fol- 
lowing these rules it may not be possible to find the pot of gold at 
the end of the rainbow, the "balanced ration," on the other hand it 
may be entirely possible to do something very practical — to give 
balance to the daily dietary and to gain a certain freedom from fam- 
ily food customs, neighborhood food traditions, and, let us even hope, 
from personal food likes and dislikes. 

To balance the dietary means: to supply in the meals of each day, 
in a form best suited to the individual, all the substances needed to 
build the tissues, bone, muscle, nerves, blood; to provide energy for 
the day's activities; to keep the body in good working order. 

A dietary may contain ample bone-building material and may lack 
the substances needed to produce red blood corpuscles. The needs of 
muscles may be satisfied while bones and nerves remain hungry; or 
all tissues may be well supplied, but the dietary may be lacking in 
substances that regulate such processes as the flow of digestive juices, 
the activity of the intestine and its ability to empty itself, or the 
purification of the blood through neutralizing harmful compounds 
produced by the work of the body. The various body needs must there- 
fore be taken into account in the planning of the dietary. 

Choice of Foods for Body Needs 

It is not possible to make an exact grouping of foods according 
to the definite part that each is capable of playing in the dietary, for 
most common foods are able to play several parts and therefore may 
satisfy a variety of needs. In a general way, however, it is possible 
to indicate which foods best serve a certain body need. 

Foods especially adapted to furnish the foundation substances 
of all living, active tissues: Milk, eggs, cheese, meat, legumes, nuts, 
cereals. 

While all these foods are nourishing, they cannot replace one an- 
other in every respect. For example, either milk or eggs might be 
chosen for the purpose of muscle-building; but milk is much richer 
than eggs in bone-building, and lime and eggs are richer than milk in 
red-blood-corpuscle-producing Cereals, legumes, and nuts are all rich- 

—20— 



er in energy than are milk, eggs, or meat, and meat has a stimulating 
property lacked by the others. 

Foods especially adapted to supply "the body with energy: Cereals, 
legumes, foods rich in starch and sugar, foods rich in fat. 

Foods especially adapted to supply lime to the diet: Milk, 
legumes, whole cereals, cabbage, celery. 

Milk is the best source of lime. No food can replace it satis- 
factorily in the diet of the growing child. 

Foods especially adapted to supply iron to the diet: eggs, legumes, 
oatmeal, vegetables, meats, fruits. 

Foods especially adapted to stimulate the activity of the in- 
testine , and thus to keep the body clean: Fruits, vegetables, cereals 
and cereal foods containing part or all of the outer layers of the grain. 

Foods especially adapted to neutralize harmful substances pro- 
duced in the tissues and blood: Fruits, vegetables. 

The main part of the meals of each day should consist of simply 
prepared, mild-flavored, non-stimulating, and easily digested foods. 

Well-'cooked cereals, thoroughly baked, sweet-flavored bread; 
potatoes; milk; eggs; fresh, succulent vegetables; and fruits — these 
should constitute the background of the dietary. 

Meats and meat soups, candies, preserves, desserts, cakes and 
other sweets, rich sauces, pickles, and condiments should be used in 
moderation in order to give color and interest to the dietary, but 
they should not furnish the bulk of the food at any one meal. a. 

a. Cornell Reading Courses Food series. 

Balanced Ration 

Owing to the wide variety of food materials from which we may 
get the compounds needed for body building, repair, regulation, 
warmth and energy, selection is necessary. Instinct, appetite, ex- 
perience and chemical analysis all may guide in the proper selection. 
The craving of natural appetite under normal conditions indicates 
a need of the body. Experience, together with a knowledge of the 
needs of the body and the compounds in food make possible in- 
telligent eating. 

In order that food may fully and properly supply the necessary 
materials just as they are required the daily meals must be "balanced." 
A properly balanced meal is one which fully meets the needs of the 
body of the one eating it. We can only approach the perfectly 
"balanced meal" and are forced to rely then upon instinct, appetite 
and experience. Fortunately nature greatly assists human limitations 
by substitutions and adaptations in the digestive processes. When the 
food we eat fails of the bodily needs grave consequences may re- 
sult, such as arrested development, debility and disease. 

It is very important that we know at the out-set that no two 
people need exactly the same foods at all times. Age, occupation, 
bodily weaknesses, excessive bodily supplies, powers of digestion and 
assimilation together with a number of other influences must be 

— 21 — 



considered in the adaptation of foods to the needs of the body. Thus 
the matter of balancing a ration is a many sided problem and re- 
quires diligent study, pains-taking care and a wide range in the 
knowledge of foods, their content and adaptability in the processes 
of digestion. 

Many of the known diseases are traceable to the habits of eat- 
ing and the consequent evil- effects. Headache, indigestion, liver 
trouble, impure blood and kindred ailments are due as a rule to some 
aspect of the problem of proper food and right eating; and all bodily 
difficulties are modified and relieved by proper foods and habits of eat- 
ing. 

Rules for Planning Inexpensive Meals 

A few rules and commonly known facts regarding the com- 
position, uses and effects of the common foods may greatly assist 
in the selection and preparation of food for the daily ration. The 
following are suggestive: 

Plan meals for the day that each may provide some of the es- 
sential compounds: i. e., protein, fats, carbohydrates, mineral matter 
and water. 

One heavy protein dish in the form of meat is sufficient for a 
day when properly supplemented with milk, legumes (beans or peas), 
eggs, cheese, etc., age and physicial activity dictating amounts. Chil- 
dren under five years of age should have little or no meat. 

Fat provides fuel in a concentrated form, is laxative and a nerve 
builder. The more digestible forms of fat are: cream, butter, olive 
oil, crisp bacon, etc. 

Carbohydrates are the chief source for energy and heat of the 
body and are more digestible and more economical than fats. Especial- 
ly is this true of the starchy forms; such as cereals, potatoes, etc. 

Milk is the best source for two of the minerals — lime and 
calcium — it being necessary to the growth of children. Necessary 
iron for the blood should be provided by yolk of egg or strained 
vegetables. 

Fresh vegetables and fruits all contain mineral matter and 
should be a part of every diet. 

Water is essential to the food nutrients. It dissolves and re- 
duces food substances to liquid making them more digestible. It is 
essential in removing waste from the body and is a regulator of 
bodily heat by means of the respiratory glands of the skin. About 
five pints of water can be profitably taken by an adult in one day. 

Sweets in the dietary are unquestionably desirable, but they 
should be served in such a manner as not to reduce the appetite for 
other foods and not to satisfy the appetite with sweet foods only. 
"Sweets" should be eaten with other foods and at the close of the 
meal. 

Tea and coffee should be used sparingly by adults and never by 

—22— 



children. Strong acid drinks are not advisable for either children or 
adults. Cocoa may be given to children after the fifth year. 

Meals to fully meet the needs of the body should satisfy a normal 
hunger. 

Bulk is essential in the well regulated diet because it stimulates 
the flow of digestive juices and aids in carrying away waste materials. 
It is an important factor in preventing constipation. 

It is best to have contrast and variety represented in the food 
of a meal, heavy and light foods, sweet and sour, etc. 

If the dietary supplies sufficient iron, calcium and phosphorus 
there will be sufficient supply of the other minerals. 

The body uses the carbohydrates first, then fats and lastly its 
muscular tissue for fuel. 

The dietary should be planned so as to meet the needs of all 
members of the family. The main part of the meal may be made suit- 
able to all, and to this the foods specially needed by each may be 
added. Little children should not eat all foods allowable to adults, 
nor should the grown members of the family be limited to the same 
simplicity of diet as the children, for children have undeveloped 
digestive organs that will be over-taxed by heavy foods. The strength 
of food in the diet of the child should be increased only as the mus- 
cles of the digestion strengthen and develop. Foods that are too 
strong over-tax the immature digestive tract and foods that are too 
weak fail to develop it. Hard muscular work increases the need for 
the energy-producing foods, but does not materially affect the need 
for other types of food.

LEFTOVER FOODS 

(From Iowa State Agricultural College Extension Department — 
Home Economics.) 

"WASTE NOT, WANT NOT" 

The American housekeeper has had an unenviable reputation as a 

careless buyer, a thoughtless manager and a reckless waster of foods. 

In no other way has this been more apparent than in the custom in 

many homes to throw away bits of leftover food materials which might 

— 25— 



be put to good use. Much more credit is due to the woman who, as 
far as possible, prevents the accumulation of leftovers but who uses 
them wisely as they are found, than to the woman who cooks fresh 
food attractively and well, but who throws away foods which still 
contain food value and which might form the basis of palatable dishes. 

Leftovers and Some Uses 

Bread — White, graham, whole wheat, corn, rye, toast, b'scuit, 
pancake or waffle batter. 

Meat and Eggs — Beef, pork, ham, bacon, chicken, fish, eggs — 
boiled, fried or scrambled. 

Gravy. 

Vegetables — String beans, onions, potatoes, beans, peas, corn. 

Cereals — Rice, macaroni, oatmeal, cornmeal, cream of wheat, 
hominy. 

Fruit Sauces — Apple, prune, rhubarb, cranberry, etc. 

Fats — Suet, bacon fat, meat fryings, chicken fat, butter. 

Prevent leftovers (when possible): 

1. By careful planning. Do not serve too many kinds of food 
at each meal. Provide variety between meals. Do not cook too great 
an amount of each food. 

2. By careful serving. Do not serve too generously. It is bet- 
ter to have a second helping in reserve, so that if not eaten it may be 
used later. 

Use leftovers (when at hand): 

1. Practice economy^true, not false. Other things than money 
should be considered in practicing economy. The fuel to be used; the 
time to be spent; the food value to be saved and the additions that 
must be made should all be taken into account. Use good judgment 
in the selection of leftovers to be used. 

2. Consider appearance. More skill is needed to make leftover 
dishes attractive than the fresh foods. The wise housekeeper will re- 
member this and make her leftover dishes as attractive in appearance 
as she can. 

3. Prevent monotony. Practice making many different leftover 
dishes. The family will soon tire of the same food cooked in the same 
way many times. 

4. Provide flavor. Remember that many leftover foods, particu- 
larly meat, have lost their original flavor and must be made tempt- 
ing if they are to prove popular with the family in the madeover dish. 
This does not mean that extravagant flavorings must be used, however. 
Select the highly flavored vegetables, as well as the standard season- 
ings.

LEFTOVER RECIPES 

LEFTOVER BREAD — RHUBARB AND BREAD PUDDING 

Four slices dry bread (buttered), 2 cups rhubarb (uncooked), 
three-fourths cup sugar, one-fourth teaspoonful nutmeg. 

Place a layer of rhubarb (cut in inch pieces) in the bottom of a 
buttered baking dish, sprinkle with sugar and nutmeg. Then place 
a slice of bread, more rhubarb and more bread until dish is filled, 
having last layer of rhubarb, sugar and nutmeg. Bake until rhubarb 
is soft. 

LEFTOVER MEAT — STUFFED BISCUIT 

Leftover cooked meat, biscuit dough, two cups flour, four tea- 
spoons baking powder, one teaspoon salt, three teaspoons fat, three- 
fourths cup milk or water. 

Combine biscuit dough and roll on board one-half inch thick. 
Cut as for biscuit, spread half of each biscuit with melted fat, place 
a small amount of meat (ground and mixed with gravy and seasoning) 
on the biscuit and fold over as for Parker House rolls. Bake and serve 
with gravy. 

LEFTOVER VEGETABLES — VEGETABLE SOUP 
One-fourth pound ground raw beef, two cups cold water, two cups 
vegetable stock, one-half cup rice (uncooked), one-half cup each of 

—28— 



ground cooked carrots and cooked beam cut in inch pieces, salt and 
pepper. 

Soak beef one-half hour in cold water. Add vegetable water and 
rice. Boil until rice is done. Add carrots, string beans, salt and pep- 
per. Heat and serve. 

[NOTE — Raw vegetables may be used by adding to the soup with 
the rice. Any leftover vegetables may be used to take the place of 
carrots and string beans.] 

LEFTOVER CEREALS— CEREAL OMELET 

One cup cold cooked cereal, two eggs, one-half teaspoon salt, one 
tablespoon parsley, one tablespoon fat. 

Beat eggs well, add cereal, salt and parsley. Melt fat in omelet 
pan and turn in the mixture. Cook with moderate heat until firm. 
Fold, turn on hot platter and serve. 

LEFTOVER FRUIT JUICE — RHUBARB PUDDING SAUCE 

One-half cup sugar, two tablespoons flour, one cup rhubarb juice, 
two tablespoons butter, one-eighth teaspoon nutmeg. 

Mix flour and sugar, add fruit juice and cook until thickened. 
Add butter and nutmeg. 

[NOTE — This sauce is good served over stale cake.] 

LEFTOVER FAT — CINNAMON BREAD 

One egg, milk, two cups flour, two teaspoons baking powder, one- 
half teaspoon salt, two teaspoons ground cinnamon, three-fourths cup 
sugar, two tablespoons bacon fat. 

Beat egg in a measuring cup and add enough milk to fill the cup. 
Sift baking powder and cinnamon with flour and add to egg and milk. 
Add sugar and melted fat and bake. 

SUGGESTED ECONOMY 

Use food materials which are most abundant and cheapest: Corn- 
meal, rice (cracked), milk, cheese and peas and beans (for meat sub- 
stitutes). 

Use home prepared foods: Whole wheat flour, canned and dried 
fruits and vegetables. 

Cook potatoes with peeling on and save valuable nutrients. 

Use the tops of garden vegetables for greens, such as beets. 

Use bones and trimmings of meat and fowl for soup stock. 

Use milk in every form in cookery: Breads, cottage cheese, pud- 
dings, soups, sauces, "junket," with cereals and as beverage. 

Use few fried foods: Fat delays digestion of other nutrients. 

Steam and bake foods — boiling wastes flavor. 

Bacon, ham and sausage fats are expensive. Use them to flavor 
cereals and vegetables. Mix suet with lard for pie crust. 

Oleomargarine is a healthful substitute for butter. Beef and mut- 
ton fats, cottonseed oil and patent preparations are reliable sources for 
cooking fats. 

—29— 



Use the water from vegetables in soups and gravy. A well made 
gravy is a good substitute for butter. 

Reduce the consumption of tea and coffee to a minimum. A 
child under 5 years of age should have a quart of whole milk a day. 
(Milk contains all the food compounds and is easily digested.) 

Use fruit flavors with tapioca, sago, cornstarch and rice. 

Substitute butter with other fats in making chocolate, spice and 
fruit cake, gingerbread and sauces. 

Plan all meals and avoid having leftovers when possible. Use 
any leftovers. 

Throw absolutely no food materials away. 

Use all precautions to avoid food spoiling. 

Use only common foods in season. 

WASTE IN FOOD PREPARATION 

Due to: 

1. Poor selection of the necessary foods — ignorance. 

2. Too much of one kind of food (unbalanced ration). 

3. High priced food materials when cheaper are equally nutritious. 

4. Valuable nutrients lost with parings and refuse — carelessness. 

5. Undercooking, overcooking — wrong methods. 

6. Unattractive, unpalatable dishes — no art. 

7. Poor preservation of foods, handling, spoiling — lack of precau- 

tion. 

8. Failure to estimate needs — "leftovers" — extravagance. 

9. Serving two similar foods — lack of forethought. 

10. Waste of fuel — poor management. 

11. Variation of dishes and diet. 

12. Use of prepared and "canned goods" when others would do. 

13. Unwise purchases, small quantities, frequency, wrong material. 

14. Unwise use of best foods, milk, cheese, rice, etc. 

WASTE IN EATING HABITS 

Due to: 

1. Rapid eating, poor mastication. 

2. Eating too much — wasted energy and food. 

3. Eating expensive and unnecessary foods. 

4. Irregular eating, too frequent and too much at one time. 

5. Eating under stress, in moods or meditation. 

DIETARY STANDARDS 

The information gained from a study of the composition and 
nutritive value of foods may be turned to practical account by 
using it in planning diets for different individuals or groups. It is 
possible to learn about how much of each of the nutrients of com- 
mon foods is needed by persons of different occupations and habits 
of life and from this to compute standards representing the average 
requirements for food of such persons. 

—30— 



In computing the results of dietary studies the various factors 
commonly used in the United States, taking the food requirements 
of a man at moderately active muscular work, as the standard, are 
as follows: 

Man at moderately active muscular work 1 

Man at hard muscular work 1.2 

Man at light muscular work and boy 15 to 16, 9 

Man at sedentary occupation and woman at moderately active 

work, boy 12 to 13, girl 15 to 16 years old require 8 

Woman at light work, boy 12 and girl 13 to 14 years of age re- 
quire 7 

Boy 10 to 11 and girl 10 to 12 years old require 6 

Child 6 to 9 years old requires 5 

Child 2 to 5 years old requires 4 

Child under 2 years of age requires 3 

These factors are based in part upon experimental data that is 
subject to revision when evidence shall warrant, a.

CONSERVATION OF FOODS 

Potatoes 

Peeling potatoes wastes about 25 per cent of the nutritive part. 
Steaming may save the whole potato. Learn to eat the well cleaned 
peeling of the baked potato. It's wholesome. 

Potatoes rubbed with drippings bake more quickly, save heat, 
have a better flavor and the potato loses nothing in shrinkage. 

Let potatoes stand for fifteen minutes in hot water before bak- 
ing and you will save half the heat and time of ordinary baking. 

Butter 

Butter that has grown "strong" with age and exposure may 
be saved by heating. Melt, skim and use the fat for cooking purposes. 

Butter substitute may be made as follows: Bring half-cup of 
good milk to boil then set aside to cool. When lukewarm add a 
quarter of pound of unmelted butter, beat with egg beater until mix- 
ture is thick and creamy, then cool and let harden. The result though 
light in color can be satisfactorily used. 

Salt added to oils, lard and fats improves their flavor and makes 
possible their use as butter. 

Butter may be substituted by bacon rind in seasoning vegetables. 

Sugar 

Add a quarter of teaspoonful of soda to each quart of fruit, 
especially the acid fruits, plums, gooseberries, etc., also to rhubarb 
and you may save a third of the usual amount of sugar. 

A substitute maple flavor may be added to sugar syrup by first 
boiling corn cobs in the water used for syrup. 

—31— 



Honey makes a good substitute for sugar in making cookies or 
cake. Use about a third more honey than you would sugar on ac- 
count of moisture present. 

Sweet fruits will often satisfy a child's craving for sweets. 

Fruit juice (orange and lemon, mixed) added to an equal 
amount of sugar after it has been dissolved in an equal amount of 
water can be used as sweetening for beverages with a great saving. 

Flour 

You save over a third the cost of bread by home-baking. 

Every crumb of stale bread may be made the basis of an attrac- 
tive meat dish, hot breads, bread puddings and other desserts. Un- 
eaten cereals can be used to thicken soups, stews and gravies. 

Wheat flour may be well substituted by the different products 
from the other cereals. (See Breads.) 

Milk 

Sour milk can be utilized in making hot breads, cottage cheese, 
cream cheese and clabber. 

Sour cream is a good shortening for cakes and cookies, and can 
be made into salad dressings and gravies for meats. 

Skim milk may be used in all cookery. 

Butter milk may be used as sour milk. 

Milk may be kept cool by keeping wet cloth about the bottle. 

Milk at twice its usual cost is worth more than meat or eggs 
based on its food value. 

Fruits 

Stew wilted fruits and serve with cereals or as a simple sweet 
for home lunch or supper. When too spoiled for this purpose, cook, 
press the juice out and use as flavoring extract or as basis for a 
beverage. 

Cores and peelings of practically all fruits, properly cleaned, 
may be allowed to simmer in kettle with teaspoonful of ginger or 
piece of ginger root and will result in a palatable beverage. 

Dried peels of citrus fruits are valuable for flavoring foods. 

Left-over bits of fruit may be combined. Fruit flavors blend well 
usually and may be used for flavoring puddings, pastry fillings, etc. 

Peelings of fruit generally add to the flavor and should not be 
wasted unless necessary. 

Dried fruits may supply the same nutriment though not so pleas- 
ing to the taste as fresh fruit. 

Eggs 

Cover left-over egg yolk with water to prevent crust forming. 

Cover egg whites closely and keep in refrigerator. 

Egg may be permanently kept with a solution of lime and water 
in large jars. Pour the clear solution from three pounds of unslacked 
lime, well slacked in five gallons of water. 

The water glass method is similar but more expensive: Pour 

— 32— 



solution of one part water glass and ten parts boiled water over 
eggs in jars. Allow liquid in all cases to come a couple inches above 
top layer of eggs. Avoid the eggs being exposed to air after entering 
solution. These methods preserve fresh eggs well from six to eight 
months. 

Fats 

All pure fats are equally valuable as food. Those most prized 
for flavor are most expensive. Cottonseed oils, corn and peanut oils 
are cheaper and can easily substitute the more expensive olive oil. 

Olomargarines may properly substitute butter. A liberal use of 
cream should be included in children's diet when oleomargarine is 
part of their diet. 

Fatty portions of meat are greater sources of energy than lean 
and constitute one of the greatest wastes in the average family. 

Drippings from bacon and ham together with fatty portions of 
all meats can be used well as seasoning for vegetables and salads. 

Fats with objectionable odors can be improved with savory 
herbs, apple or onion, or with strong seasoning materials such as 
sage. 

Rancid fat may be renewed by heating with several pieces of 
charcoal. Allow it to remain warm several hours and then strain 
carefully. 

Beef and mutton suet are too hard for satisfactory shortening 
and may be softened by mixing softer fats such as lard or cottonseed 
oil with them. The following recipes have been found satisfactory: 
a. 

Soft Fat 1. Mix two parts rendered beef or mutton fat and one 
part lard. Add one-half pint milk to each 2 lbs. of the mixture before 
rendering. The product may be used for frying or shortening. 

Soft Fat 2. Mix three parts rendered beef or mutton fat and 
one part refined cottonseed oil. Render fats in double boiler. Heat 
and stir mixture thoroughly. When cooling stir frequently to avoid 
separating of the fats.

Meats 

Less meat can be used in the dietary by careful use of meat 
substitutes and left-over meat. 

The following uses for left over meat are recommended by the 
Kansas State Department of Domestic Science, Agricultural College: 

Left over meat may be used as: 

1. Croquettes — Any kind of meat, ground, one part mashed po- 
tatoes or rice and egg and gravy or stock or white sauce. 

2. Hash — Any kind of ground meat and one part potato, mash- 
ed or chopped and seasoned. May be in ratio of one part to two 
parts potato. 

—33— 



3. Stew — €old steak or roast, cut in cubes. Heat in. gravy, sea- 
son with vegetables. 

4. Meat Pie — -With No. 3 as a basis put in a baking dish, cover 
with baking powder biscuit dough and bake in hot oven. 

5. Minced Meat on Toast — Cut meat in fine cubes, warm in 
gravy, serve on toast. 

6. Escalloped Meat — Cut meat in cubes, add to gravy, place in 
baking dish with alternate layers of rice or dressing. Cover with 
bread crumbs and brown. 

7. Shepherd's Pie — Same as meat pie, except that cover is of 
cold mashed potatoes. 

8. Jellied Meat — Cold roast veal cut in cubes and added to a 
highly flavored gelatin stock. Mold, cool and slice. 

9. Meat Fritters — Add ground meat to fritter batter and fry 
in deep fat. 

10. Meat Sandwiches — Shredded cold roast or fowl. 

Importance of Soup 

In soup nothing is lost. Use odds and ends of meat, left over 
vegetables and bones from steaks and roasts. For seasoning add all 
water in which vegetables are cooked, the well washed parings of 
vegetables and water used to rinse out pans in which vegetables are 
cooked. The importance of a long cooking for soup is imperative. 

PRESERVATION OF FOODS 
Home Canning 

1. Methods. A. Open-kettle or hot-pack method. This method 
is the oldest and commonly used method. It is suited to ordinary 
fruits, preserves, jam, etc. It is laborious and not suited for large 
quantities. It requires a complete cooking of the food products before 
packing or filling and sealing. As the packing is done after the 
sterilization has been done there is always possibility of spores and 
bacteria getting in before the can is finally sealed. 

B. The Intermittent, or fractional-sterilization method. This 
method completely sterilizes and usually overcooks the products, it 
is laborious and requires a large amount of fuel and time. 

C. Cold-water method. The cold water method is often used for 
canning acid fruits, gooseberries, cranberries, etc. It is satisfactory 
in canning rhubarb. The product should be well washed, placed on a 
strainer and scalding water poured over it, then packed at once in 
practically fresh jars, clean cold water being added until the jars are 
filled. Seal at once. 

D. Vacuum seal method. This method requires the specially made 
vacuum seal jars. After the food has been blanched, cold dipped, and 
cooked enough to make it ready for table use it can be packed in the 
jars and a vacuum produced. When the jars and work of canning are 
flawless this methed can be successfully used. 

—34— 



E. Pressure cooker method. This method relies on the live 
steam to sterilize the products. This method requires less time for 
complete sterilization than any of the above methods — 10 to 20 min- 
utes with two to five pounds steam pressure for fruits. 

P. Cold pack method. This is the most satisfactory known meth- 
od. It is simple and can be used in preserving all kinds of products. 

CANNING BY THE "COLD PACK" METHOD 

(From Iowa State Agricultural Extension Department.) 
All fresh fruits, vegetables and meats may be successfully canned 
by the "cold pack" method. 

How It Is Done 

There are two parts to the cold pack canning process: 
Part I — Packing the uncooked product in the jar. 
Part II — Cooking the packed product in a hot water bath. 
This method is easily learned by anyone who will follow the di- 
rections carefully. Following are the steps of procedure: 

1. Secure sound, fresh products. 

2. Clean and trim the products. 

3. "Scald" or "blanch" as directed. 

4. "Cold dip" immediately. 

5. Pack the product in the jar. 

6. Add hot water or syrup. 

7. Adjust rubber and cover on the jar. 

8. Partially seal the jar. 

9. Cook in hot water bath. 

10. Remove from bath and complete the seal. 

Equipment Needed 

The ordinary home already has the equipment. The necessary 
articles are: 

1. The regular fruit jars, including the screw top, glass top with 
wire bails, vacuum top jars and good rubbers which fit the jars used. 
Tin cans may also be used. 

2. "Sterilizing vessels" for hot water bath. This may be a flat 
bottom kettle, a wash boiler, a lard can, a clean garbage can, a metal 
peck or half bushel measure, a pail, a milk can, or any other con- 
tainer deep enough to hold the jars set in a vertical position, with 
sufficient room below for water to circulate underneath the jars, and 
room above so that the jars may be covered by at least a'n inch of boil- 
ing water. The size of the vessel otherwise is governed by the amount 
of product to be sterilized each time. 

3. A rack or "false bottom" to place in the bottom of the ster- 
ilizing vessel on which the jars may be set. This may be any kind 
of -frame work that will hold the jars at least one-half inch above 
the bottom of the kettle to permit free circulation of water under the 
jars and prevent jars from coming in direct contact with the heated 

— 35 — 



bottom of the kettle. A piece of stiff wire netting cut to fit the con- 
tainer, with the edges beaten down, a wire tea stand, or a rack made 
by fastening some wire netting to two small cross pieces do very well. 
A piece of stiff woven wire, fastened to a metal rim, makes an excel- 
lent false bottom. 

4. One vessel for hot water, into which the product may be low- 
ered for scalding or blanching. 

5. One vessel for cold water, into which the product may be 
lowered for the "cold dip." 

6. A jar lifter for placing and removing jars from hot water bath. 
This may be a piece of heavy wire, a fork, or other device with the 
lower end turned so as to slide under the edge of the jar. 

7. Other kitchen equipment ordinarily used in preparing the 
product. A wire basket or piece of cheese cloth or thin muslin may be 
used for blanching or scalding the product. Plenty of clean, hot water 
should be available. Use the kitchen stove or other means provided 
for home cooking. Use the equipment you have unless you find it 
pays, as a matter of convenience or speed, to devise or secure some- 
thing else. 

NO PRESERVATIVE NEEDED — No canning powder, vinegar, 
salt, sugar or any other preservative is needed. If the product is 
cooked in closed jars in the hot water bath as directed, the food will 
be sterilized so that it will keep indefinitely. If it is desired to flavor 
the product by adding some salt, sugar syrup, vinegar or other flavor, 
this may be done when the product is packed in the jar. 

Procedure 

1. SELECT SOUND, FRESH, RIPE PRODUCT — Take the prod- 
uct directly from the garden, field or orchard. Avoid using a product 
which has been gathered more than five or six hours. 

2. CLEAN AND TRIM THE PRODUCT — Clean it as you would 
for use. That is, remove skins, pits, cores, seeds, roots, silks and trim 
po'ds; cut in halves, fourths, eighths, in cubes, or can whole, as you 
may want to have the product when it is to be used. 

3. SCALD OR BLANCH — To "scald" means to immerse the 
product in boiling water a very short period to loosen the skin. 
"Blanching" means to immerse the product in boiling water for a 
longer period to reduce bulk, remove objectionable acids or flavors, and 
help with sterilizing. Tomatoes and peaches should be scalded only 
long enough to loosen the skins. The degree of ripeness and other 
conditions of product determine the time necessary. The time table 
gives approximate time for scalding and blanching different products. 

HOW — Have a kettle of boiling water handy. Place product in 
wire basket, thin towel, or cheese cloth; lower in boiling water. Re- 
move promptly as indicated by time table for blanching, or when skins 
are loosened in scalding. If scalded or blanched too long, the prod- 
ucts will be too much cooked for best results. The "cold dip" follows 
immediately. 

—36— 



4. COLD DIP IMMEDIATELY — To "cold dip" lower the product 
immediately from the hot water into cold water. The cold dip helps 
to separate the skin from the product, helps to keep the coloring mat- 
ter, firms the texture. The sudden change from hot to cold helps to 
destroy bacteria and spores and cools the product so it is easier 
to handle. Remove product from cold dip at once. 

5. PACK PRODUCT IN THE JAR — The jars, tops and rubbers 
should all have been made ready so that product can be packed in 
immediately. It is best to have glass jars hot so they will be properly 
tempered to go into the "hot water bath" as soon as packed. Be sure 
that the rubbers and tops are good ones and that there are no rough, 
uneven edges where the sealing takes place, between the jar and the 
top. Pack products well so as to have a well filled jar when com- 
pleted. 

6. ADD HOT WATER AND SYRUP — After the product is packed 
in the jar, complete the filling of the jar by pouring in hot water or 
syrup. Generally, hot water is used with vegetables and syrup with 
fruits, except with tomatoes, when no liquid is needed. Water may be 
used with fruits if desired. The syrup is made by dissolving sugar in 
water and bringing to a boil. The proportion of sugar to water is 
governed by the taste. The syrup is really a seasoning to be de- 
termined by the flavor desired. 

7. ADJUST RUBBER AND COVER — Place rubber; see that it 
lies flat and fits well. Place cover; be sure rubber and top are good 
ones. 

8. DO NOT COMPLETELY SEAL GLASS JARS — With screw-top 
jars, screw cover on, then turn cover back just a little (about one- 
half inch) just enough to loosen it so that when heated the steam may 
escape. With spring sealing jars, have top spring in place, but leave 
the side to hold it on. The spring will release the cover enough 
to allow for escape of steam. If covers are too tightly adjusted, expan- 
sion from heating may blow the rubber out or break the jar. 

9. THE "HOT WATER BATH" — As soon as the jar is packed 
and partially sealed, place it immediately in the hot water bath for 
sterilizing. There is advantage in having the water in the bath boil- 
ing when jars are set in. If they have been filled with boiling water 
cr hot syrup, no breakage will occur. Use good judgment in this. 
If jars seem not hot enough to place in hot water bath immediately 
without danger of breakage, set them first in warm water to temper 
them. 

Cook products as per time table. Do not begin counting time 
until the water is at a jumping boil. If undercooked, the product will 
not keep; if overcooked, the product may lose flavor, color and texture. 

10. ' REMOVE FROM BATH AND SEAL — As soon as the product 
has cooked at a boiling temperature the number of minutes indicated 
by the time table, remove the jar from the bath, examine rubbers and 

—37— 



complete sealing the jar. Screw top down, put clamp down, or other- 
wise complete the seal according to the kind of jar used. 

Protect glass jars from draft when removing from bath to avoid 
breakage. Set jars where they will ccol without disturbance until 
seal sets. 

CAUTIONS — Follow directions faithfully. Be sure to completely 
sterilize the product. Be sure of a perfect seal. Use good judgment 
all the time and you will have a superior canned product that will 
keep indefinitely. 

CANNING CLUBS, CANNING RECIPES, INFORMATION — In- 
quire of your county club leader, county agent, county superintendent 
of schools, or write to the agricultural extension department of your 
state, for information concerning organization of canning clubs and 
the circulars giving canning recipes, instructions and complete direc- 
tions for canning club work by the "cold pack" method. 

CANNING SYRUPS 

Thick syrup is that which has become so thick that it is dif- 
ficult to pour out of a spoon or container, but is not sugared (density 
from 50 to 64 per cent). 

Thin syrups are used for all sweet fruits that are not too delicate 
in texture and color, such as cherries, peaches, apples, etc. Medium- 
thin syrups are used in the canning of the medium-sweet fruits, such 
as blackberries, currants, dewberries, huckleberries, raspberries, etc. 
Medium-thick syrups are used in the canning of all sour fruits, such 
as gooseberries, apricots, sour apples, etc., and delicately colored fruits, 
such as strawberries and red raspberries. Thick syrup is used in pre- 
serving and making all kinds of sun-cooked preserves.

IMPORTANT CANNING SUGGESTIONS 

Facts for Home Canning 

(Prepared by O. H. Benson, in charge Boys' and Girls' Club Work, 
North and West, U. S. Ext. Dept.) 

Do not combine two recipes or two sets of instructions in can- 
ning. To do so means to fail. 

Remember that adequate heat, plenty of clean water, and com- 
plete sterilization are absolutely necessary. 

The cold pack method of canning does not mean that the canning 
is done without heat, but simply means that the final sterilization is 
done after the jar or can has been completely filled, the rubber and 
cap put in place, or the tin can completely sealed. 

When using glass jars always utilize the jars on hand, but when 
it is necessary to buy new jars, buy the best. They are the cheapest 
in the long run. No glass jar with metal or rubber in direct contact 
with the food product is desirable unless the cap is enameled, lacquered 
or vulcanized. Glass jars should be thoroughly cleaned and should be 
taken directly from hot water to be filled. 

In coring, peeling and slicing apples, drop the apple product into 
a vessel containing cold, slightly salted water, in order to keep it 
from discoloring before packing. 

Canned products in glass jars if exposed to light will bleach, fade 
and sometimes deteriorate in food value, hence the necessity of 
wrapping in paper. 

If vegetables and greens are blanched in a steamer and then 
plunged into cold water, it is perfectly safe to use tin cans; however, 
enameled or lacquered cans are always the safest. 

Do not can rhubarb in tin cans unless at least a 35 per cent density 
syrup and enameled cans are used. 

Products canned in tin should be emptied into glass, porcelain, 
china or stoneware as soon as the can is opened. 

Pack the jars and tin cans thoroughly, but avoid the overpacking 
of tin cans with products such as corn, peas and lima beans, as all 
of these expand somewhat during sterilization. 

Avoid using too much salt in the canning of vegetables, greens, 
tomatoes and sweet corn. A little sugar added before sterilization 
will improve the product and sometimes shorten the time required for 
processing. 

Avoid destroying the vegetable or volatile oils in products such 
as greens, cabbage, brussels sprouts and cauliflower when canning, but 
be sure to eliminate the excessive acids. This is done by blanching 
the product in a steamer or large dishpan (over a false bottom), with 
just a little water beneath the greens. 

In canning windfall apples whole, sliced or quartered, remember 
that they must be sterilized enough to keep, but avoid overcooking, 
which reduces the product to apple sauce or discolors the pulp. 

—40— 



An adequate supply of convenient and efficient canning equip- 
ment is important to success. 

In using steam pressure outfits, remember that too much pres- 
sure injures the quality of all food products. 

Begin the canning work with a small quantity of one product the 
first day. Take time to do the work well, then test the products he- 
fore canning a large quantity. 

Standardize the products, and if they are to be marketed, protect 
the standard and the trade mark faithfully from year to year, through 
a uniform and reliable product. All canned goods offered for sale 
should be carefully labeled in accordance with the requirements of 
state and federal food laws. 

In many instances it is important to can with a home made out- 
fit first, in order later to be in better position to determine what kind 
of outfit best meets individual needs. 

Business organization and management is nowhere more im- 
portant than in canning operations. The proper placing of tables 
with relation to canner, water, fuel and supply of vegetables and fruits, 
the arrangement of utensils, and the system with which the canning 
work is executed are all essential matters. 

CANNING MEAT 

(From New York State Agricultural Extension Department.) 

METHOD I — Free the meat from the bone, and cut it in pieces 
of such a size that they will go into the jars easily. Pack the raw 
meat solidly into tested clean glass jars, filling the jars to within three- 
fourths inch from the top. Sprinkle over the top of the meat one- 
half teaspoonful of salt for each pint of meat. Add no water. Celery 
leaves, onion, pepper or other seasonings may be added if desired. 
Adjust on the jar a new rubber of good quality. Place the cover on 
the top of the jar, and adjust, but do not fasten, the upper wire clamp, 
or if a mason jar is used, partly screw on the cover. Place the jars 
on a rack in a tightly covered container, such as a wash boiler or a sap 
bucket, in which there is warm water that reaches to within about 
one inch from the tops of the jars. Sterilize the meat by cooking it 
lor from four to five hours, beginning to count the time when the 
water around the jars reaches the boiling point. A steam cooker is 
particularly convenient for this process, and a pressure canner reduces 
the sterilization period, but a wash boiler or a sap bucket answers the 
purpose satisfactorily. Before removing the cans from the sterilizer, 
complete the sealing of each jar by adjusting the lower wire of the 
clamp or, in the case of a mason jar, by screwing the top tight. Keep 
the jars in a cool, dark place. 

METHOD II — Sear the meat in a hot oven, in hot fat, or in boiling 
water, and steam it or simmer it until it can be torn apart. Pack the 
meat into the jars, fill the space with stock, and add one-half tea- 
spoon salt to each pint of meat. Sterilize the meat for three hours as 

—41 — 



in Method I. Unless the meat is first browned, it does not have so 
good a flavor as that of raw meat steamed in the can. 

Canned Chicken 

Chicken may be successfully canned by either of the two methods 
suggested. Canning surplus cockerels that have reached the proper 
size does away with the necessity of feeding and caring for them dur- 
ing the winter months. A fowl weighing two pounds when dressed 
should make a pint can of solid meat and a pint of stock thick enough 
to jelly. A fowl weighing three pounds should fill one and one-half 
pint can. 

Chicken Stock 

All bones and trimmings of the chicken should be covered with 
cold water, salted, and slowly simmered until the flesh drops in shreds 
from the bones, and the liquid, or stock, is concentrated. Seasoning, 
such as onion and a bit of celery leaf, may be added. Strain the stock, 
if desired, reheat it, and boil it for ten minutes. Pour it into sterilized 
jars, and sterilize it as described under Method I for one hour on each 
of two successive days. 

HOME DRYING 

(a) SUN DRYING. This method is effective but slow, and en- 
tails considerable work before product is thoroughly dry. After fruit 
or vegetables are cleaned and all imperfections are removed the prod- 
uct should be sliced or reduced to small particles in order to expose 
surface for the escape of moisture. After drying pile up and allow to 
"sweat," thus equalizing moisture, then spread out and dry again. 
Pack in boxes and keep in cool place. 

(b) FAN DRYING. This method is rapid and effective, and 
reduces the labor to a minimum. Instead of using one large frame, 
several small frames, with wire netting (screen) bottoms, piled one 
upon another are used. Each frame should be as wide as the di- 
ameter of the fan used, and about three feet long by three inches deep. 
Pile three to six deep. The ends at which the fan is placed should be 
open to make possible the passage of the air in currents over the prod- 
uct. An electric fan of large diameter is probably the most efficient 
means of applying this method. Home made fans attached to gasoline 
engines are easily provided and may be quite as effective as electric 
power. The chief aim is to cause a strong current of air to pass across 
the product. Fruits should be thinly sliced and vegetables should be 
reduced to very small slices or pieces before applying the air. This 
method requires only twelve to twenty-four hours to effectively reduce 
the weight and bulk of the product by evaporation. About 90 per 
cent of the moisture should be taken out. After thorough drying 
seems to have been accomplished, it is well to place product in sealed 
jars or containers and keep in cool, dry place. The drying processes 
preserve ail the flavor and nutriment, and if conducted properly are 
the cheapest and most satisfactory way to preserve foods. 

—42— 



(c) HEAT DRYING. This method has been conducted success- 
fully with all kinds of products. The plan is to apply heat either by 
placing the product in oven or above the stove. Rapid or intense heat- 
ing modifies the flavor of the product. Slow application of heat by 
placing racks or frames above very slow fire is effective with some 
kinds of fruits [as apples] and is not an unusual method in drying 
green corn. Frequent stirring and moving may be necessary to pre- 
vent scorching. 

HOME STORAGE 
(U. S. Ext. Dep't.) 

The Keeping of Vegetables, Fruits and Meats 

The following hints regarding the keeping of different kinds of 
food may be found useful: 

Potatoes are kept without difficulty in a cool, dry and dark place. 
Sprouts should not be allowed to grow in the spring. 

Such roots as carrots, parsnips and turnips remain plump and 
fresh if placed in earth or sand filled boxes on the cellar floor. 

Sweet potatoes may be kept until January if cleaned, dried and 
packed in chaff so that they will not touch each other. 

Pumpkins and squash must be thoroughly ripe and mature to keep 
well. They should be dried from time to time with a cloth and kept, 
not on the cellar floor, but on a shelf, and well separated from each 
other. 

Cabbages are to be placed in barrels, with the roots uppermost. 

Celery should be neither trimmed nor washed, but packed, heads 
up, in long, deep boxes, which should then be filled with dry earth. 

Tomatoes may be kept until January if gathered just before 
frost, wiped dry, and placed on straw covered racks in the cellar. 
They should be firm and well grown specimens, not yet beginning 
to turn. As they ripen they may be taken out for table use, and any 
soft or decaying ones must be removed. 

Apples, if for use during the autumn, may be stored in barrels 
without further precaution than to look them over now and then to 
remove decaying ones; but if they are to be kept till late winter or 
spring they must be of a variety known to keep well, and they must 
be hand picked and without blemish or bruise. They should be wiped 
dry and placed with little crowding on shelves in the cellar. As a 
further precaution, they may be wrapped separately in soft paper. 

Pears may be kept for a limited time in the same way, or packed 
in sawdust or chaff, which absorbs the moisture which might other- 
wise favor molding. 

Oranges and lemons are kept in the same way. Wrapping in soft 
paper is here essential, as the uncovered skins if bruised offer good 
feeding ground for mold. Oranges may be kept for a long time in 
good condition if stored where it is very cold, but where freezing is 
not possible. Lemons and limes are often kept in brine, an old fash- 
ioned household method. 

—43— 



Cranberries, after careful looking over to remove soft ones, are 
placed in a crock or firkin and covered with water. A plate or round 
board placed on top and weighted serves to keep the berries under 
water. The water should be changed once a month. 

In winter large pieces of fresh meat may be purchased and hung 
in the cellar. Thin pieces, as mutton chops, are sometimes dipped in 
mutton suet, which keeps the surface from drying and is easily scraped 
off before cooking. 

Turkeys, chickens and other birds should be carefully drawn as 
soon as killed and without washing hung in the coolest available 
place. 

Smoked ham, tongue, beef and fish are best put in linen bags 
and hung in the cellar. 

Salt pork and corned beef should be kept in brine in suitable jars, 
kegs, or casks, and should be weighted so as to remain well covered. 
A plate or board weighted with a clean stone is an old fashioned and 
satisfactory device. 

Eggs may be packed for winter use in limewater or in water- 
glass solution, methods which are described on an earlier page. Many 
housekeepers have good success in packing them in bran, in oats, or 
in dry salt, but according to experiments the preference is to be given 
to the 10 per cent solution of water glass. Exclusion of the air with 
its accompanying micro-organisms and the prevention of drying out 
are what is sought in all cases. Packed eggs are not equal to fresh 
eggs in flavor, but when they are well packed are of fairly good quality 
and perfectly wholesome. 

Storage of Groceries, Meats, Cooked Food and Canned Goods 

Flour comes packed both in barrels and in bags, and the form 
in which it shall be purchased and kept is of importance to the house- 
wife. Bags have certain advantages over the barrel for both producer 
and consumer; they pack into freight cars with no waste of space, 
and the cloth for eight bags costs less than one barrel; for the con- 
sumer, also, it is often convenient to buy in small quantities. But. 
on the other hand, the bag is too often very flimsy in texture, so that 
it allows flour to sift out, and is also easily soiled by contact with a 
damp or dirty floor. The purchaser may well require that the bags 
be made of good material, so that the contents may be protected from 
dust and dirt. 

The various prepared or "self rising" flours are more expensive 
than the mixture that the housewife can easily make by adding the 
requisite amount of baking powder to flour and sifting it several times. 
It is a convenience and a saving of time to keep this mixture on hand, 
as one sifting provides enough for a month's use in cakes and muffins. 

The fact that many breakfast cereals that were once sold only in 
bulk can be bought in packages is a great advantage from a sanitary 
point of view. The contents of these packages, if bought fresh and if 
well cared for, will remain in good condition for months. If made 

— 44— 



in clean factories, such goods have had little chance for contamina- 
tion from dust and dirt. 

If breakfast cereals are bought in bulk they should be kept in 
tight receptacles in a cool, dry place. Crackers may be kept like 
breakfast cereals, either in the package, in which many sorts are 
marketed, or in tin boxes or in jars. 

Cornmeal spoils more readily than flour, and for most families it 
is best to buy in small quantities. 

Rice, tapioca, macaroni and similar dry materials may be kept 
without any trouble in covered cans or small crocks in a dry, clean 
place. The same method is advisable for raisins, Zante currants, 
evaporated and dried fruits and similar supplies. 

Sugar and salt are best kept, the former in tin, the latter in 
wooden or crockery receptacles. 

Glass preserve jars are perhaps the best and most convenient of 
all containers- for small quantities of almost any food material. 

Bread and Other Cooked Foods 

While cooling, newly baked bread should be lightly covered with 
a clean cloth or paper to prevent mold germs and dust from falling 
upon it, but should not be tightly wrapped in a thick cloth as is the 
practice in some households, for unless it is aired when taken from 
the oven, it is likely to become "soggy" and damp and thus offers 
an excellent medium for cultivation of molds. When perfectly cold 
the bread should be placed in a close receptacle that has been thor- 
oughly scalded and aired. If bread is to be kept for more than two 
or three days in damp, hot weather, the jar or box should be taken 
out and sunned for a short time now and then, and again scalded and 
dried. On no account should portions of a former baking be stored 
with a new batch. 

Cake and cookies should be cooled after baking and kept in tin 
boxes or in earthenware jars, which, like bread boxes, should be often 
scalded and aired. Even if these foods are to be eaten at the next 
meal it is well to keep them in some such receptacle, as it insures 
protection from dust. A cake, pudding or pie put out of a window 
uncovered to cool or in any other place where it is exposed to dust, 
and in summer also to flies, is something that no careful housewife 
would place on her table if she stopped to think how easily the food 
may be contaminated. 

Canned Fruits and Other Canned Goods 

Commercial canned goods may be advantageouly bought by the 
dozen in the autumn, and they do not seem to suffer from even a poor 
storage place, provided it is not so damp that the cans rust through. 
If dirty or dusty, the cans should always be carefully wiped before 
they are opened to prevent accidental soiling of the contents. 

Vegetables and fruits canned at home, and home made jellies, 
jams and similar foods should be kept in dry, airy storage places, out 
of direct light. 

—45— 



Canning may also be made use of daily for temporary preserva- 
tion of food, and it is especially valuable where ice chest facilities are 
not good. When making soup stock a large quantity is made as 
easily as a small, and the surplus may be poured, while hot, into fruit 
jars and sealed. Boiled milk may be thus canned, and cooked vege- 
tables which may be at the time plentiful or cheap. Mince meat may 
also be canned, but it will keep a long time in an ordinary receptacle 
if melted suet be poured over the top. 

JELLY MAKING 

(From the Uni. of Neb. Agric. Ex. Service.) 

METHOD OF JELLY MAKING — Extract the fruit juice by boil- 
ing the fruit, since most of the pectin is not extracted from fruit unless 
it is heated. Boil juice one-half the time of boiling; that is, if ten 
minutes are allowed for currant jelly, then boil juice five minutes be- 
fore adding sugar. The juice should not simmer on the back of the 
stove, because long heating destroys the pectin or jellying power. 
After boiling the juice one-half the time, add sugar, heated or warmed 
in oven, and finish cooking. Sugar should be warmed, because if it is 
added cold it will cool the fruit juice and thus make necessary longer 
cooking and less certain results. 

In making jelly use only three-quarters of cup of sugar to the 
cup of juice (if it contains pectin) and you will get a perfect jelly 
that will "stand." The old rule, "cup for cup," is necessary when 
using very green fruits as under-ripe grapes or currants. (To test 
juice for "pectin" add to one tablespoon of the juice an equal 
amount of alcohol and if a gelatinous mass results pectin is 
present. To add pectin to fruit juice cook the juice with the white 
inner skin from oranges or lemons (both of which are rich in pectin) 
Then test juice again. 

A jelly test may be made by dropping jelly from a spoon. If it 
sheets off it is ready to be put in jelly glasses. Another test is the 
formation of two drops, broad at the base, formed simultaneously on 
the side of a tablespoon. These are quicker tests than putting a tea- 
spoonful of jelly in a saucer to cool. By the time the jelly has cooled 
it may have boiled beyond the proper stage. When the jelly test is 
obtained it should be poured immediately into glasses. When cool it 
should be covered with paraffine and paper or tin cover. The best 
results have been obtained by cooking only small quantities of jelly 
at one time — four to six glasses. 

Fruit juice may be extracted more than once. With grapes and 
currants, especially, it will pay to make two extractions of juice. The 
resulting jelly is about the same as jelly made from the first extract. 
To make the second extract, cover with water the pulp left after the 
first draining and let boil one-half hour. It is well to test the juice as 
suggested above to determine the amount of pectin. 

Jelly failures are due to a lack of pectin or acid, too much sugar, 
or too much water. Test your fruit juice for pectin, and if you find 

— 46— 



it lacking add apple juice or juice made by boiling the rind of lemons 
or oranges. Jelly failures are also due to too long cooking of juice 
or allowing it to simmer instead of boil. Avoid an overuse of sugar, 
for if too much has been added longer cooking will never make the 
juice jelly. 

PRESERVING FRUIT 

In the case of most fruits, canning with a little sugar is to be pre- 
ferred to preserving with a large quantity of sugar. There are, how- 
ever, some fruits that are only good when preserved with a good deal 
of; sugar. Of course, such preparations of fruit are only desirable for 
occasional use. The fruits best adapted for preserving are strawber- 
ries, sour cherries, sour plums, and quinces. Such rich preparations 
should be put up in small jars or tumblers.

COMPARATIVE MEASURES AND WEIGHTS. 

Accuracy of measurement is necessary for accuracy in all proc- 
esses of food preparation. The following comparisons of quantities 
may prove useful to the housewife (all measurements are taken level) : 
3 teaspoonfuls make 1 tablespoonful. 

16 tablespoonfuls (dry material) make 1 cupful. 

14 tablespoonfuls (liquid) make 1 cupful. 

It is equally desirable to know the equivalent weights of the meas- 
urements called for: 

2 cupfuls butter packed solidly 1 pound 

2 cupfuls sugar 1 pound 

2 cupfuls meat finely chopped 1 pound 

2 2/3 cupfuls powdered sugar 1 pound

Explanation of Score Card 

FLAVOR — The flavor of your bread should be something like the 
flavor of freshly cracked nuts. It should not taste of yeast and it should 
not taste sour or musty. 

QUALITY OF CRUMB— Cut the bread through the middle of the 
loaf lengthwise. Press it lightly with the finger. The bread should 
be soft enough to press easily, but the dent should spring back to the 
level surface. If the dent stays in the bread, your loaf should lose ten 
points on dcughiness and moisture. If the bread is so hard that you 
cannot press it easily, you will know that you have used too much flour 
in mixing it, or it has baked too long. 

POROSITY OF GRAIN — Bread should have a fine grain and should 
have no large holes in it. The holes should be of equal size all through 
ihe loaf. 

LIGHTNESS— Bread should be equally light all through. There 
should be no heavy spots or streaks anywhere. 

Sweetness — -Bread should have no sour smell or taste. 

COLOR — Bread should be a good cream color. It should not be 
grayish or greenish in color. 

CRUST — The crust should be a golden brown on top and bottom. 
It should be evenly browned and not more than one-eighth inch thick. 

SHAPE AND SIZE — The loaf is more easily baked in a pan that 
is about ten i7iches long, four inches wide and five inches high. This 
makes a fine looking loaf that is not too large to bake well. The loaf 
should rise evenly and be of uniform height in all parts. It should 
not rise enough to bulge over the side of the tin. 

WHITE BREAD- — Two cups scalded milk (or half milk and half 
water or two cups water); two tablespoonfuls lard or butter, one 
tablespoonful sugar, one teaspoonful salt, one-fourth yeast cake dis- 
solved in one-fourth cup lukewarm water, six cups flour (about). 

—50-— 



Dissolve yeast cake in one-fourth cup lukewarm water. Scald 
the milk. Place sugar in a bread bowl. Add the hot milk. Wait 
until the milk is lukewarm and add the dissolved yeast cake. Be- 
gin to add flour gradually and beat thoroughly as the flour 
it added. Beat out all the lumps and make the batter look smooth and 
shining. Add flour until batter is like pancake batter. Let rise until 
il is full of bubbles. Add salt and melted shortening. Add flour to 
make a smooth, elastic dough that can be handled without sticking. 
Too much flour will make the bread hard. This bread may be made 
by setting a hard loaf at first, but it must rise three times before 
baking and the grain is improved by letting it rise a fourth time. 

RISING — Place the bread in a bowl and cover with a towel. Keep 
warm, never hot and never cold. Heat kills the yeast plants and cold 
makes them grow so slowly that the bread will not have a good flavor. 
Let the bread rise until it has doubled its bulk. If the bread is allowed 
to rise too long a time it will become sour. 

KNEADING — Knead lightly with a quick rolling motion of the 
hands. Continue kneading until the dough is elastic and until you 
hear a snapping, cracking sound in the dough. Long kneading makes 
an elastic, fine grained bread. 

MAKING INTO LOAVES — Take the dough from the bowl, knead 
it lightly for a few minutes without adding flour, divide it into two 
equal parts. Knead each portion until a smooth, firm loaf is made 
to fit an oblong pan that is about 4x5x10 inches in size. Set the loaves 
in a warm (not hot) place and allow them to double their size. Best 
temperature 75 to 85 degrees P. 

BAKING — The oven should be hot enough to brown a teaspoon of 
flour a light yellowish brown in five minutes. A loaf of this size should 
bake about fifty minutes and the oven should be cooler during the last 
fifteen minutes than during the first five minutes. When the bread is 
done, it should be an even golden brown color, all over the outside. 
Ihe inside of the loaf should be soft but should be firm enough to 
spring back when you make a dent in it with the finger. If the dent 
does remain where you make it, you may know that your bread has not 
been baked enough. 

CARE AFTER BAKING — Take the loaf from the pan and set it 
on bread cooler and cover lightly to allow the steam to escape. Brush 
the crust with milk or melted butter, if you wish. 

BATTERS AND DOUGHS— Quick bread mixtures are either bat- 
ters or doughs. 1. Batter is a mixture of flour and liquid, thin enough 
to be beaten. A pour batter, or thin batter — one measure of liquid to 
one measure of flour (popover). A drop batter — one measure of liquid 
to about two measures of flour (muffins, fritters, cake). II. A dough 
is a mixture of flour and liquid stiff enough to handle on a board. Soft 
dough — one measure to 2 2/3 measures of flour (biscuit, doughnuts). 

—51— 



Stiff dough — one measure of liquid to 3 1/2 or more measures of flour 
(bread). 

GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR MIXING BATTER AND DOUGHS 
— 1. Mix and sift dry ingredients. 2. Measure liquid ingredients. 
3. Add the liquid to the dry ingredients. 4. Use two level teaspoon- 
fuls baking powder to one cupful flour when no eggs are used. 5. If 
eggs are used less baking powder will be required. 6. Baking powder 
mixtures should be handled as little as possible and baked in a hot 
oven. 

BAKING POWDER — 1. Composition, acid, alkali, corn starch. 2. 
Proportions, one-half acid, one-fourth soda, one-fourth corn starch.

YEAST BREADS 

(Uni. Nebr., Dora. Sci. Dept.) 

WHITE BREAD— Allow the yeast to soak for three hours in a 
cup of lukewarm water to which one teaspoonful sugar has been added. 
Into the mixing bowl place one-half cup flour and scald with one and 
a half pints potato water. Add to this two medium sized potatoes, 
which have been well mashed, and enough flour to make a soft sponge. 
When lukewarm add yeast. Keep moderately warm all night. In the 
morning add to the above sponge one pint scalded milk, when it has 
cooled to blood heat, in which the following have been dissolved: one- 
half cup sugar, one and a half tablespoonfuls salt, two. tablespoonfuls 
laid. Add flour to make a stiff dough, let rise until double in size, 
knead down, let rise again, knead down and form into loaves. Allow 
the loaves to double in bulk, and bake for one hour. Never grease the 
pan in which the dough is placed to rise. 

SWEET RUSK ROLLS — In the morning take one pint of the 
sponge as described above, add one egg, one-half cup sugar, and two 
tablespoonfuls melted butter. Add flour to make a soft dough, let rise 
until double in bulk, then doll into long, slim rolls, about six inches 
long, grease, and tie into loose knots. Allow to rise until very light, 
and bake about thirty to forty minutes. On removing from the oven 
rub the top with butter. 

RYE BREAD — One cup milk, one cup boiling water, one table- 
spoonful lard, one tablespoonful butter, one-third cup brown sugar, one 
and a half teaspoonfuls salt, one-fourth yeast cake, dissolve in one- 
fourth cup lukewarm water.

until double in bulk. Cut down, beat thoroughly, add raisins and 
spread evenly in buttered pan one-half inch thick. Let rise. Before 
baking brush over with beaten egg and cover with the following mix- 
ture: Three tablespoonfuls melted butter, two tablespoonfuls flour, one- 
third cup brown sugp.r, one tablespoonful cinnamon. 

WHITE BREAD, USING PART CORN FLOUR— 1. Two cups 
water, three cups white flour, two tablespoonfuls sugar, one cake yeast. 
2. Seven cups white flour, one tablespoonful salt, two tablespoonfuls 
lard (melted), two cups corn flour, two cups skimmed milk (scalded). 

Make a sponge of No. 1. When real light add to ingredients in 
No. 2 Corn flour should be sifted with four cups of the white flour. 
Let rise until double in bulk. Shape into loaves. Let rise again until 
double in bulk and bake. 

RICE BREAD — 1. One and a half cups water, three tablespoon- 
fuls sugar, one cake yeast, two cups white flour. 2. Two cups skim- 
med milk (scalded) two cups uncooked rice (two teaspoonfuls salt, one 
cup water), one tablespoonful salt, two tablespoonfuls lard, two cups 
white flour. 

Make sponge of No. 1. Steam rice in a steamer — not a 
double boiler, using one cup water. Steaming is preferable since 
rice will be too dry if cooked any other way. Mash rice some- 
what. When sponge is light, add to ingredients in No. 2. Milk and 
rice should be lukewarm when yeast is added. Make a real stiff dough. 
Allow it to rise until it has doubled its bulk; form into loaves, allow 
to rise until double in bulk again and bake in moderately hot oven. 

ROLLED OATS BREAD — 1. One cake yeast, one cup lukewarm 
water, four cups boiling water, four cups rolled oats, one-third cup 
brown sugar. 2. Four tablespoonfuls melted lard, eight cups flour, two 
tablespoonfuls salt. 

Pour four cups boiling water over rolled oats, cover and let stand 
until lukewarm. Dissolve yeast and sugar in one-half cup lukewarm 
water, add this to rolled oats when lukewarm. Add two cups flour, or 
enough to make an ordinary sponge. Beat well. Let rise until light. 
Add rest of ingredients to make a soft dough. Knead well. Let rise 
until double in bulk, mould into loaves. When double in bulk, bake 
in moderately hot oven. Oatmeal (steel cut oats) may be substituted 
for rolled oats. 

WHOLE WHEAT BREAD — 1. One and one-half cup water, one 
and one-fourth tablespoonfuls sugar, two cups flour (white), one cake 
yeast, one cup whole wheat flour. 2. Two cups skimmed milk (scald- 
ed), one tablespoonful salt three tablespoonfuls lard, seven cups 
(more or less) whole wheat flour. 

Make sponge of No. 1. When light add to No. 2. Let rise until 
double in bulk. Mould into pans. When double in bulk bake in a 
moderately hot oven. 

—56— 



POTATO BREAD — Three pounds boiled and peeled potatoes, nine 
cups bread flour, one cake yeast, one-half cup water, one tablespoonful 
salt, three tablespoonful sugar. 

Clean and boil three pounds (or about ten to twelve medium pota- 
toes) allowing them to get very soft. Peel and mash the potatoes 
while hot, leaving no lumps. Take one and a half pounds, or 
two and a half solidly packed cups of mashed potato while luke- 
warm and add dissolved yeast and salt; add one cup flour, mix thor- 
oughly. Do not add any more water at this stage unless absolutely 
necessary. Let this mixture rise until it has become very light. Sponge 
will be much softer when risen. Now add remainder of ingredients, 
knead thoroughly until a smooth and elastic dough has been formed. 
The dough must be very stiff since the potato contains a large amount 
of water. Let rise until more than double in volume. Shape into 
loaves, let rise again and bake in moderate oven.

FRENCH FRIED POTATOES 
Wash and pare small potatoes, cut into strips one-third inch 
square and soak one hour in cold water. Take from the water, dry 
between towels, and fry in deep fat. Drain on brown paper and 
sprinkle with salt. Care must be taken that the fat is not too hot, 
as the potatoes must be cooked as well as browned. 

PEAS AND CARROTS 

Scrape or pare two carrots, then cut lengthwise into quarters 
and the quarters into strips one and one-fourth inches long and one- 
fourth inch wide and thick. Simmer until tender in a very small 
amount of water. When cooked, the water should be nearly evap- 
orated. 

Drain canned peas, rinse in cold water, and add one-half cup 
boiling water. Boil five minutes, drain, and add carrots. Season with 
one teaspoon salt, one teaspoon sugar, one-fourth teaspoon white 
pepper, and three tablespoons butter. Shake over the fire to mix 
the ingredients. Serve at once. 

LIMA BEANS WITH TOMATO SAUCE

tender. It usually takes about two hours. Salt toward the end of the 
cooking. Drain and serve with tomato sauce. 

TOMATO SAUCE 

Two tablespoons butter, two tablespoons flour, two teaspoons 
sugar, one cup strained tomato, salt, pepper. 

Melt the butter and add the flour and seasonings. Add the 
strained tomato, let boil three minutes, stirring all the time. If a 
more highly seasoned sauce is desired, brown a slice of onion and one 
slice of carrot in the butter, add the flour and seasonings, the un- 
strained tomato, one bay leaf and two cloves. Cook ten minutes. 
Strain. 

ESCALLOPED CABBAGE 

Take off outside leaves, cut into sections, remove core, wash in 
two waters and drain. Have large kettle two-thirds full of violently 
boiling water (one and one-fourth teaspoons soda and one tablespoon 
salt to two quarts water). Place the leaves in water one at a time 
and do not let the water stop boiling. Boil uncovered twenty-five 
minutes (usually less), or until tender. Drain, put into a buttered 
baking dish, add white sauce. Cover with buttered bread crumbs and 
brown in oven. 

White Sauce: Four tablespoons butter, four tablespoons flour, 
one teaspoon salt, two cups milk. Melt butter, add flour, mix thor- 
oughly. Cool. Add milk, heat to boiling, and cook until thick. 

STUFFED ONIONS 
Peel the onions. Scoop out from tops a portion of the center, 
parboil them for fifteen minutes, and turn upside down to drain. Fill 

—69 — 



them with a stuffing and sprinkle buttered crumbs on top; place in a 
pan containing an inch of water, cover, let cook in an oven one hour, 
or until tender, but not so long as to lose their shape. Take off the 
cover for the last five minutes. Serve with tomato sauce. 

STUFFING FOR ONIONS 

Two cups stale bread crumbs, one cup minced veal, chicken, 
ham or beef, three tablespoons melted butter, the inside of a pepper 
chopped finely, one teaspoon salt, two slices of onion chopped finely. 

Brown the pepper and onions in butter, add the bread crumbs,

will be enough for six onions. 

CHINESE METHOD OF COOKING RICE 
Wash thoroughly rice grains in strainer under running water, 
rubbing rice with fingers until the water that runs off is clear. Have 
ready a large kettle of rapidly boiling water (one tablespoon salt to 
two quarts water). Throw into water a few grains of rice at a time 
so as not to check the boiling of the water. Boil from twenty to forty- 
five minutes (depending on the age of rice) or until soft, which may 
be determined by testing the kernels between the fingers. Drain the 
rice in a strainer, place a towel over it, and set on the back part of 
the stove or in the oven to dry. 

RISOTTO 
Boil rice until tender, drain, steam it dry. Mix lightly with 
grated cheese. Turn into a hot serving dish and pour over the fol- 
lowing sauce: 

Sauce for Risotto: Three tablespoons butter, three tablespoons 
water, one-half teaspoon cornstarch, one small onion (finely chopped), 
three teaspoons beef extract, three to four mushrooms, salt and cay- 
enne pepper. Cook onion in butter until well browned, add water 
and other ingredients, and simmer five minutes. One cup of tomatoes 
may be used in place of water.

General Directions for Cake Making 

I. Get all materials and supplies ready before beginning to mix 
the cake. 

II. Sift flour, baking powder and salt and spices together. 

III. Cream butter and sugar. 

IV. Add egg yolks, slightly beaten. 

V. Then alternate, adding moisture and flour mixtures; beat 
thoroughly. 

VI. Fold in stiffly beaten egg whites. 

VII. Baking: Never fill cake pan more than two-thirds full, 
and the dough should be pushed away from the center. A medium 
hot oven at first usually gives the best results. Loaf cake takes about 
forty minutes. Layer cake, twenty-five minutes. A cake is thor- 
oughly baked when no dough clings to the tootpick when it is placed 
in the cake, or when the cake draws away from the sides of the pan. 
If no impression is left on the cake when it is touched with the finger 
it is thoroughly baked.

Farmers' Bulletin No. 565, page 3. 

The average composition of corn is 7/10 starch, 1/10 protein, 
1 /10 water and 1/10 fat. crude fiber and mineral matter. 

Because of the high per cent of starch and fat, corn is a cheap 
source of fuel food. When cornmeal is iy 2 cents per pound, 10 cents 
worth of cornmeal yields 6540 units of heat. Ten cents worth of 
wheat flour at 3 cents per pound yields only 5440 units of heat. Corn 
is : also a cheap source of protein. When cheese is 16 cents per pound, 
10 cents worth of cheese yields 1185 units of heat. 

Cornmeal supplies 10 per cent of the total amount of protein, 
3.8 per cent of the fat and 13.7 per cent of the carbohydrates con- 
sumed by the people of the United States. 

Suggestions for Combinations 

Cornmeal is somewhat lacking in the protein that is essential for 
growth and maintenance. 

Combine cornmeal with eggs, milk, cheese or meat to supply 
this lack. , 

Cornmeal is lacking in gluten. 

Combine cornmeal with rye, wheat, graham or gluten flour to 
supply gluten. 

CORNMEAL MUSH 

One-half cup cornmeal, one and one-half cups water, one teaspoon 
salt. 

Boil salted water; add cornmeal gradually and cook one hour. 

USES OF CORNMEAL MUSH 

1. Serve hot with milk. 

2. Serve hot with butter and sugar.

3. Serve hot with syrup. 

4. Cool, cut in slices and fry. 

5. Add ground cooked meat. 

6. Add one-half cup grated cheese. 

7. Add one-half cup tomato sauce and one chopped sweet green 
pepper. 

[NOTE — Grits may be used instead of cornmeal.] 
CORN CAKE BAKED IN A FRYING PAN 

One and one-third cups cornmeal, one-third cup flour, one cup sour 
milk, one-half teaspoon soda, two eggs, two cups sweet milk, four 
tablespoons sugar, three-fourths teaspoon salt. 

Mix and sift the dry ingredients together; add the sour milk, 
beaten eggs, one cup sweet milk, sugar and salt. Beat thoroughly 
and pour mixture into a hot buttered frying pan. Pour over the re- 
maining milk and bake in a moderate oven. 

CORNMEAL IN YEAST BREAD 

The following recipe is suggested by the Bureau of Chemistry, 
U. S. Department of Agriculture: 

Wheat and Corn bread (four loaves): Two and two-thirds cups 
cornmeal, three and one-half cups cold water, two cakes compressed 
yeast, two cups lukewarm water, three tablespoons sugar, one and one- 
half tablespoons salt, two and one-fourth cups white flour, three table- 
spoons shortening. 

Stir the cornmeal into the cold water, bring to boiling point, and 
cook in double boiler ten minutes. Cool. Dissolve the compressed 
yeast cakes in the lukewarm water and add to cornmeal mush. Sift 
the sugar, salt and one cup flour together, and stir into cornmeal and 
yeast mixture. Beat thoroughly and set to rise at temperature be- 
tween 80 and 8 8 degrees Fahrenheit. It should be light within two 
hours. Beat it thoroughly, add melted shortening if desired, and add 
the remainder of the flour; knead thoroughly until smooth and elastic. 
Set to rise as before. When double in bulk, mold into four loaves, 
place in slightly warmed and greased pans, cover and set to rise. 
When double in bulk, bake in a steady oven (400 to 425 degrees 
Fahrenheit) for forty-five to fifty minutes. 

CORNMEAL AND RICE GRIDDLE CAKES 

One-half cup cornmeal, one-half cup flour, one-half teaspoon soda, 
one teaspoon salt, one cup sour milk, one cup cold boiled rice, two 
eggs.

CORNMEAL AND APPLE PUDDING 

One-half cup cornmeal, one quart milk, one teaspoon salt, one 
teaspoon ginger, one-half cup molasses, two cups apples (cored and 
cut in eighths). 

—82— 



Scald the milk and add the cornmeal; cook for thirty minutes and 
add the salt, ginger and molasses. Pour in a buttered baking dish, 
bake for one hour, stirring occasionally; add the apples and bake 
one hour longer without stirring. Serve with cream or pudding sauce. 

CORNMEAL AND PUMPKIN PONE 
One quart well cooked pumpkin, one cup cornmeal, two cups 
sweet milk, one tablespoon salt, one cup sugar, one teaspoon soda. 

Stir the cornmeal into the hot pumpkin; then add milk, salt and 
sugar. Add enough more cornmeal to make the mixture stiff enough 
that it will hold its shape when dropped from the spoon. Then stir 
in soda (dissolved in boiling water). Bake an hour and a half or 
longer. The longer it bakes, the sweeter it seems.

they are unable to prepare a dish without it. It is unfortunate that 
this is true, for often much time and effort are spent searching for 
certain recipes which are not at all difficult if the fundamental prin- 
ciples are understood. There are certain underlying principles which 
govern all recipes. These principles may be worked out in a system 
of plain patterns which may form the basis of much of the cooking.

THE FEEDING OF CHILDREN 

(University of Nebraska, Agriculture Ex. Ser., Home Eco. Dept.) 
The First Year 

Mother's milk is best. 

It contains the right ingredients in the right proportion for the 
development of the child. It is practically free from disease germs, 
and is of uniform temperature and composition. The breast-fed baby 
has a better chance for life than the bottle-fed baby. 

The diet of the nursing mother should be light, abundant, and 
appetizing. Include eggs, green vegetables, and ripe fruits. Include 
one quart of milk a day. Avoid foods which cause indigestion, as heavy 
desserts and fried or underdone foods. Sunlight, fresh air and plenty 
of water to drink are essential to the nursing mother. 

Give the baby plenty of water to drink. Boil the water and then 
cool it. 

If the mother cannot nurse the child, give cow's milk. Modify it 
according to the physician's directions. Never give medicine to a 
child without consulting your physician. Many patent medicines and 
soothing syrups contain habit-forming drugs. 

Basis of Dietary Through the Second Year. 

One quart of milk a day, strained cereals, egg yolks, stale bread 
(toast), fruit juice, (a) orange, (b) ripe peach, (c) strawberry; cream, 
butter. 

Basis of Dietary Through the Third Year 

One quart of milk a day, cream, butter, cereals, unstrained but 
thoroughly cooked, eggs, stale bread, fruit pulp, (a) grapes, (b) pine- 
apples, (c) prunes, (d) apples, (e) oranges, peaches, strawberries. 
Vegetables, strained, (a) spinach, (b) carrots, (c) peas, (d) celery, 
(e) beans, (f) asparagus. Omit strongly flavored vegetables. 

Suggestive Diet for Child Who Will Not Drink Milk. 

Age five years — (One quart of milk concealed in the menu): 
Breakfast, 7:30, oatmeal, one-fourth cup cereal cooked in one cup 
milk, creamy egg on toast, one egg yolk with one-half slice toast and 
one-fourth cup milk. 

10:30 a. m. — cocoa, one teaspoonful and one-fourth cup milk, 
toast and cream, one piece toast and one tablespoonful cream. 

Dinner, 1:30 p. m. Spinach soup, one-half cup, baked potato, one 
potato and two tablespoonfuls cream; bread and butter, junket, one and 
one-half cup. 

—95— 



Supper, 5:30 p. m. — Rice and prunes, two tablespoonfuls rice 
cooked in one-half cup milk, toast. 

Foods to Be Avoided Until the Child Reaches the Sixth Year. 

Fried meats Hot bread or hot rolls 

Fried vegetables Rich cakes 

Green corn Griddle cakes 

Eggplant Pie 

Turnips Doughnuts 

Cucumbers Tea 

Radishes Coffee 

Cabbage 

When children are constipated, do not dose them with medicine, 
but give them more vegetables, ripe fruit, stewed prunes, oatmeal, 
molasses gingerbread, rye bread, and graham bread. Avoid wheat 
bread and crackers. If persistent, call a physician. 

3Ienu for Child Five to Twelve Years Old. 

Breakfast — Oatmeal mush, top milk, toast, stewed prunes, milk to 
drink. 

Dinner — Baked fish, creamed potatoes, spinach, bread and butter, 
rice pudding. 

Supper — Pea soup, baked potato, boiled onions, bread and butter, 
molasses cookies. 

General Rules In Planning Meals for Children 

Use coarse breads, milk, eggs and butter freely; use bacon and fish 
freely; supply fresh fruits and green vegetables; use sugar in modera- 
tion; avoid rich, highly seasoned foods. 

Habits of Eating 

Insist that the child learn to eat breakfast; teach the child to eat 
slowly and to masticate his food well; insist upon regularity in meals. 

RECIPES FOR CHILDREN'S FOOD 

(Uni. of Nebraska Agric. Ext.) 

BARLEY OR OATMEAL WATER 

Use 2 tablespoonfuls of grain to a quart of water. The grain should 
have been previously soaked over night or at least for a few hours, 
or, for an emergency, the grain may be boiled for five minutes in- 
stead. The water in which the grain was soaked should be poured 
off and fresh water added, before cooking. The grain should be 
boiled for several hours, water being added from time to time to keep 
quantity up to a quart. Strain. This makes a somewhat thin, watery 
gruel. 

BARLEY JELLY 

Prepare grain as directed for barley water. Use from 4 to 6 
tablespoonfuls of grain to 1 quart of water. Boil thoroughly for several

INVALID COOKERY 

(Uni. of N'ebr. Ext. Service) 

NECESSITY FOR PROPER FOOD 

The feeding of people who are well is of great importance but 
the selection of proper food for one who is ill is of infinitely greater 
importance because the body tissue is being broken down very rapidly. 
In acute cases of disease food is one of the greatest factors in re- 
covery. The quantity and kind taken must vary greatly, according to 
the nature of the disease. Food must be avoided that will over tax 
the digestion or disagree with any condition of the patient; food 
must be digested and assimilated to be of value. In health the ap- 
petite is a safe guide to follow but in sickness it is not always wise 
to consider its cravings. Some patients may have an abnormally 
large appetite, which must be restricted, as over-feeding would prove 
dangerous; while with others the appetite needs to be stimulated. 

Milk is one of the most valuable foods in sickness, not only be- 
cause it supplies so many body needs, but because it can be used in 
so many ways — hot, or cold, flavored or plain, made into junkets or 
sherbets or combined with eggs in eggnogs and custards, in some form 
or other milk can almost always be made digestible. Eggs are also 
of great value, not only poached and served on toast but as dainty 
omelets or in beverages, as eggnog or egg lemonade. Mild 
fruit juices are not only refreshing but of considerable fuel value. 
If there is fever, chicken, lamb chops, tender broiled steak or roast 
beef may serve to add variety to the menu. Broths stimulate the 
appetite and help digestion but they are of little or no food value 
themselves. Cereals, eggs, and milk may be added to increase their 
food value. Vegetables are best given rather sparingly, and only 
mild flavored ones, such as spinach or asparagus, if digestion is much 
disturbed. 

PRINCIPLES OF FEEDING IN SICKNESS 

Nurses should remember that it is important to give foods regu- 
larly, except when a patient is sleeping. 

Do not ask a patient what he wishes to eat but ascertain, if you 
can, what he likes best. 

All changes of diet must be gradual. Never serve a new variety 
of food to one who is seriously ill without first consulting the doctor 
and gaining his permission. 

Do not serve twice cooked food to invalids. 

Always serve very simple foods; be especially careful to avoid 
highly seasoned or spicy foods. Appeal to the sense of sight and 
taste but consider most of all digestibility and nutritive value. 

Serve hot things hot and cold things cold. 

Serve in small amounts and in courses.

ARRANGEMENT OF AN INVALID'S TRAY 

In arranging an invalid's tray be very careful to use the nicest 
china that the house affords and spotless white linen. The appearance 
of the tray may aid greatly in stimulating the patient's appetite. If 
possible have a flower or a few green leaves on the tray. 

The tray should be of a size to hold easily any dishes placed upon 
it. Cover it with a clean linen doily; a napkin may be folded and 
used for this purpose. In case of contagious diseases paper doilies 
may be used in serving and afterwards burned. In setting a tray 
first locate the plate; place the knife at the right of plate, sharp 
edge towards the plate. Place the spoon at the right of knife, bowl 
up. Place the fork at the left of plate, tines up. The napkin is al- 
ways placed at left of fork; then the cup and saucer at right of 
spoon, with the cup so placed that it may be easily raised by the 
handle. The water glass is placed over the knife, a little to the right. 
Arrange the other dishes to suit the convenience of the patient. 

DIET IN SICKNESS 

Conditions vary so that is is quite impossible to prescribe any 
particular diet for any particular disease. The food must always 
be given strictly according to the doctor's wishes. Invalid foods 
however, may be divided into three classes as follows: 



Milk 
Broths 

Albumen drinks 
Eggnog 

Cream Soups 

Soft-cooked Eggs 

Milk Toast 

Cereals 

Soft Custards 



LIQUID DIET
