This is a digital copy of a book that was preserved for generations on library shelves before it was carefully scanned by Google as part of a project 
to make the world's books discoverable online. 

It has survived long enough for the copyright to expire and the book to enter the public domain. A public domain book is one that was never subject 
to copyright or whose legal copyright term has expired. Whether a book is in the public domain may vary country to country. Public domain books 
are our gateways to the past, representing a wealth of history, culture and knowledge that's often difficult to discover. 

Marks, notations and other marginalia present in the original volume will appear in this file - a reminder of this book's long journey from the 
publisher to a library and finally to you. 

Usage guidelines 

Google is proud to partner with libraries to digitize public domain materials and make them widely accessible. Public domain books belong to the 
public and we are merely their custodians. Nevertheless, this work is expensive, so in order to keep providing this resource, we have taken steps to 
prevent abuse by commercial parties, including placing technical restrictions on automated querying. 

We also ask that you: 

+ Make non-commercial use of the files We designed Google Book Search for use by individuals, and we request that you use these files for 
personal, non-commercial purposes. 

+ Refrain from automated querying Do not send automated queries of any sort to Google's system: If you are conducting research on machine 
translation, optical character recognition or other areas where access to a large amount of text is helpful, please contact us. We encourage the 
use of public domain materials for these purposes and may be able to help. 

+ Maintain attribution The Google "watermark" you see on each file is essential for informing people about this project and helping them find 
additional materials through Google Book Search. Please do not remove it. 

+ Keep it legal Whatever your use, remember that you are responsible for ensuring that what you are doing is legal. Do not assume that just 
because we believe a book is in the public domain for users in the United States, that the work is also in the public domain for users in other 
countries. Whether a book is still in copyright varies from country to country, and we can't offer guidance on whether any specific use of 
any specific book is allowed. Please do not assume that a book's appearance in Google Book Search means it can be used in any manner 
anywhere in the world. Copyright infringement liability can be quite severe.

PREFACE. 



In offering to the public the present vol- 
ume of valuable receipts, we feel that we are 
supplying a long-felt and urgent want. Al- 
though the market is over-stocked with so- 
called Cook Books, yet none of them contain 
the receipts here presented, nor do they con- 
tain those that will supply their places in a 
satisfactory manner. 

It has been in answer to frequent' urgent 

inquiries from those who have tested these 

receipts as to where to find certain directions, 

that this book has been most carefully com- 

* piled and published. 

It is almost needless to remind all house- 
keepers, that the best way to make a husband 
happy and contented is to feed him well. 
Nothing is of more importance in a household

2 PREFACE. 

than good cooking ; and when so much com' 
fort and happiness can be gained at such a 
small expense, we wonder that more attention 
is not paid by housekeepers to this all-impor- 
tant subject. 

No trouble has been spared in the endeavor 
to render it complete and useful, by the addi- 
tion of a complete alphabetical index, that 
will aid those in search of any subject 
treated, to turn at once to the page wanted, 
without hunting through the whole book.

SOUPS. 

How TO Make Soups. — ^The word soup, to 
many minds, conveys the idea of something that 
is extravagantly rich in composition and elabo- 
rately difficult in manner of preparation. Conse- 
quently, we more frequently meet with soups as 
costly and cloying as real turtle, instead of finding 
them to be light, exhilarating and appetizing. Un- 
fortunately, many cooks do not appear to be alive 
to the fact that the less pretentious they make a 
soup the more certain it is to give satisfaction, and 
of all cooking, nothing is easier to do well, and 
nothing more difficult to do badly, than soup-mak- 
ing — ^too much pains being productive of the same 
results as too many cooks. Simply employ ingre- 
dients that are quite fresh, utensils that are thor- 
oughly clean, and skim carefully. 

If meat is used that is very fat, a cook is often 
obliged to let the soup grow cold, so as to remove 
all the fat from the top, re-warming the soup be- 
fore serving it; but if we only make use of meat 
which is sufficiently lean, and do not neglect skim- 
ming the liquor while it is simmering, we shall be'

spared the necessity of sacrificing the flavor of the 
soup for the sake of avoiding greasiness. A small 
quantity of fat, however, softens soup, half an 
ounce of butter to a quart of pottage being enough. 
Housekeepers should be aware that, though bones 
and bony joints are economical for soups, yet, when 
it can be had, the flesh of butchers' meat is prefer- 
able. Of course, this does not apply to poultry 
and game. A small slice of ham or sausage, an 
anchovy, or a spoonful of sugar, improves the fla- 
vor of soups generally. 

Any of the things from the following list will, 
with the proper addition of herbs, roots, and sea- 
soning, m'ake a tureen of good soup for a small 
&mily : 

One pound of lean meat. 

A wild pigeon. 

A small rabbit. 

A sheep's or lamb's head. 

A chicken or old fowl. 

Two pounds of raw bones. 

A tame pigeon. 

A set of giblets. 

The reduced liquor in which has been boiled 
a calf's head, fowl, turkey, rabbit, joint of meat, 
ete., etc 

STOCKS FOB SOUPS AND HOW TO MAKE THEM. 

The word "stock" for soup frequently occurs 
in receipts. We now give some receipts for mak- 
ing them :

SOUPS. 19 

Good SrocK for Ordinary Purposes. — Fom 
pounds of shin-bone, and one pound of lean neck 
of beef, four carrots, one turnip, one stick of celery, 
two parsnips, two leeks, one onion, six cloves, six 
peppers, a bunch of sweet herbs, one gallon of 
water. Cut the meat into slices, crack the bone, 
and put it into an earthen pipkin that will stand 
the fire, as this makes far better soup than a metal 
saucepan; add the water, and let it stew slowly^ 
till the scum rises, aiyi skim it clear; stick the 
cloves into the onion and then add the vegetable^ 
and let the whole stew slowly till the meat is in 
rags, which will be in about eight hours. It must 
simmer very slowly, for if it boils, the- meat will 
not yield the gravy so well, and the stx)ck will be 
thick in place of being clear. When cold, it 
should be strained through a cullender and kept in 
a covered pan or jar for use. 

White Stock. — Four pounds of knuckle of 
veal, any poultry trimmings, four slices of lean 
ham, three carrots, two onions, one head of celery, 
twelve white pepper-corns, two ounces of salt, one 
blade of mace, a bunch of herbs, one ounce of but- 
ter, four quarts of water. Cut up the veal, and 
put it with the bones and trimmings of poultry, 
and the ham, into the stewpan, which has been 
rubbed with the butter. Moisten with half a pint 
of water, and simmer till the gravy begins to flow. 
Then add the four quarts of water and the re- 
mainder of the ingredients; simmer for five hours.

fiO 80UP8. 

After skimming and strsdning it carefully through 
a very fine hair sieve, it will be ready for use. 
When stronger stock is desired, double the quan- 
tity of veal, and put in an old fowl. The liquor 
in which a young turkey has been boiled is an ex- 
cellent addition to all white stock or soup. 

Economical Stock — ^The liquor in which a 
joint of meat has been boiled, say four quarts ; 
trimmings of fresh meat or poultry, shank-bones, 
etc., roast-beef bones, any pieces the larder may 
furnish ; vegetables, spices, and the same seasoning 
as in the foregoing receipt. Let all the ingre- 
dients simmer gently for six hours, taking care to 
skim carefully at first Strain it off, and put by 
for use. 

Rich Strong Stock. — Four pounds shin of 
beef, four pounds knuckle of veal, quarter pound 
of good lean ham, any poultry trimmings, two 
ounces of butter, three onions, three carrots, two 
turnips, (the latter should be omitted in summer, 
lest they ferment,) one head of celery, a few 
chopped mushrooms, when obtainable ; one tomato, 
a bunch of savory herbs, not forgetting parsley; 
one and a half ounce of salt, three lumps of sugar, 
twelve white pepper-corns, six cloves, three small 
blades of mace, four quarts of water. Line a per- 
fectly clean stewpan with the ham cut in thin, 
broad slices, carefully trimming off all its rusty 
fat; cut up the l)cof and veal in pieces about threo

inches square^ md lay them on the ham ; set it on 
the stove, and draw it down, and stir frequently. 
When the meat is equally browned, put in the 
beef and veal bones, the poultry trimmings, and 
pour in the cold water. Skim well, and occasion- 
ally add a little cold water to stop its boiling, until 
it becomes quite clear ; then put in all the other 
ingredients, and simmer very slowly for five hours. 
Do not let it come to a brisk boil, that the stock 
be not wasted, and that its color may be preserved. 
Strain through a very fine hair sieve, or cloth, and 
the stock will be fit for use. 

PiiAiN Beep Soup. — One gallon of cold water, 
one pound of beef and two tablespoonfuls of rice. 
Let this boil, then add an onion or two^or three 
leeks ; boil an hour. Peel and slice eight potatoes ; 
wash them in warm water ; add them to the soup, 
with a seasoning of salt and pepper; stir it fre- 
quently ; boil another hour, and then serve. 

Beep Soup.— Gfet what is called a good beef 
soup bone, boil two hours, leaving about two quarts 
of broth ; break two eggs into some flour, and knead 
it very stiflF; roll out in three sheets to the thick- 
ness of wrapping paper ; spread them on a table to 
dry for half an hour ; then place them on one an- 
other and roll them up as you would jelly cake ; 
with a sharp knife cut very fine strips from the end, 
not wider than tlie thickness of a case knife ; shake 
them up to separate them; drop into your broth

it boils, take the pan off the fire, and put it on one 
side to simmer until the meat is done. When 
ready foi; use, take out the meat, dish it with the 
carrots and turnips; strain the soup, let it cool, skim 
off the iat, season it, and thicken it with a table- 
spoonful of arrowroot dissolved in cold water. 
Simmer for five minutes before serving.

and one of mushroom ketchup, half a pint of sherry, 
or Madeira wine, a little mushroom powder, and 
the jelly of the meat. When hot, if it requires any 
further seasoning, add some, and serve with hard 
eggs, forcemeat balls and a squeeze of lemon soy. 

Veal Gravy Soup. — Grarnish the bottom of 
a stewpan with thin pieces of lard, add a few slices 
of ham, slices of veal cutlet, slices of onion, carrot, 
parsnips, celery, a few cloves upon the meat, and a 
spoonful of broth. Soak it on the fire in this way 
until the veal throws out its juice. Then put it on 
a stronger fire until the meat catches to the bottom

mace. Let all boil very slowly till the meat is in 
rags, and has dropped from the bone, and the gristle 
has quite dissolved. Skim well while boiling. When 
done strain through a sieve into a deep white ware 
pan. Next day take off all the fet, and put the jelly 
into a clean soup pot, with two ounces of vermicelli ; 
set over a clear fire. When the vermicelli is dis- 
solved stir in, gradually, a pint of thick cream while 
the soup is hot. Do not let it come to a boil after 
the cream is in, lest it should curdle. Cut up a few 
rolls in the bottom of a tureen, pour on the soup, 
and serve. 

Calf's Head Soup. — ^Procure a calf's head, wash

pieces, and add it to the broth. Then season with 
sweet marjoram, sage, thyme, sweet basil, pepper, 
salt, mace, and cloves. Take one pound of suet, and 
two pounds of veal, chopped fine, and, with sufficient 
bread crumbs and seasoning as above, make some 
foroemeat balls, and fry them in butter. Make also 
some small dumplings with a little flour, butter, and

quarts of water, one onion, two tablespoonfuls of 
rice, and a little salt. Boil for two hours, and strain 
through a sieve. 

Brown Chicken Soup. — Cut up a nicely dressed 
chicken. Put it in the pot with water to cover it, 
which must be measured, and half as much more 
added to it before the soup is dished. Keep it cov- 
ered tight, boiling slowly, and take off the fat as fast 
as it rises. When the chicken is tender take it from 
the pot and mince it very fine. Season it to the 
taste, and brown it with butter in a dripping pan. 
When brown put it back in the pot. Brown together 
butter and flour, and make rich gravy by adding a

[Hnt of the soup. Stir this in the soup, and season 
it with a little pepper, salt, and butter. Be careful 
the chopped chicken does not settle and burn on the 
pot. It will be well to turn a small plate. on the 
bottom of the kettle to prevent this. Toast bread 
quite brown and dry, but do not burn it, and lay 
the toast in the tureen, and serve it with the soup. 
Stir the chicken through it, and pour it in the 
tureen. 

Partridge Soup. — A brace of old partridges

a beef or mutton bone, six large carrots, two large 
onions, one large turnip; seasoning of salt and 
pepper to taste. Put the liquor, bones, onions, 
turnips,- pepper and salt into a stewpan, and sim- 
mer for three hours. Scrape the carrots and cut 
them in thin slices, strain the soup oyer them, and 
stew till soft enough to pulp through a hair sieve or 
coarse cloth ; boil the pulp in the soup until about 
the consistency of pea soup ; add Cayenne. Pulp 
only the red part of the carrot, and make the soup 
the day before it is served. 

Vegetable Soup. — ^Peel and slice six large 
onions, six potatoes, six carrots, and four turnips ; 
fry them in half a pound of butter, and pour on 
them four quarts of boiling water. Toast a crust

and with a bunch of sweet herbs, four cloves, and a 
blade of mace, add all to the meat, over which 
pour one quart only of water, and place the stew- 
pan, covered, over a slow fire till the meat is 
brown; then turn it, but be careful it does not 
scorch. Then add three quarts of boiling water, 
and let it stew gently for an hour till you have 
carefully removed all the scum that rises; after 
which, place the stewpan at the side of the fire, 
now adding two teaspoonfuls of salt. Let it sim- 
mer for four hours, strain it through a tamis into 
an earthenware vessel, and set it by to cool. Then 
carefully remove the fat ; and when poured off to 
heat, do not disturb the sediment. The soup 
should be perfectly clear, and of an amber color; 
and will look better without any addition of vege- 
tables. 

Gumbo. — ^Take one chicken, two slices of cold 
cooked ham, three large onions ; cut the chicken 
into pieces after it has laid in salt and water a half 
hour; slice the onions, and put all into a skillet

a gallon of young okra sliced very thin. After 
peeling one quart of ripe tomatoes, add to the okra 
with three quarts of water; let it boil well, then 
add the fried meat and onions; season with Cayenne 
and black pepper, salt to taste. Boil about four 
hours until the okra is perfectly dissolved, over a 
slow fire. Then strain, according to taste. Some

case do not let it boil quite so long. It is then 
ready for table, 

Okra OB Gumbo Soup. — Boil a chicken and a 
slice of ham in sufficient water to make a tureen of 
soup. When the fowl is thoroughly done, take it 
with the ham from the brotji. Flavor the soup 
with onions, pepper, salt, and sweet herbs ; make 
a paste with ^gs and flour, roll it as thin as

possible, and slice in thin shreds ; put in the soup a 
teacupful of this, a teacupful of chopped okra, and 
a pint of oysters. 

Southern Gumbo Soup. — Fry one chicken, 
when cut up, to a light brown ; also two slices of 
bacon, pour on them three quarts of boiling water, 
add one onion and some sweet herbs tied in a rag ; 
simmer them gently three hours and a half; strain

Let it stew for two hours ; then add three medium- 
sized potatoes^ peeled; a saltq>ooiiful of salt; half a 
saltspoonftd of pepper^ and half a saltspoonful of 
mustard. Let it simmer three quarters of an hour

whde through a sieve. 

LoBSTEB Soup. — ^A shin of veal, two carrots, 
two onions, pepper, salt, mace, and four quarts of 
water; boil together four hours. Break up a large 
boiled Idbster, take the meat out of the shell, break 
up the shell into a stewpan, with water enough to 
covCT it. Let this simmer while the soup is boil- 
ing. Strain the vegetables, meat, and lobster shell, 
and put the liquor into the soup pot. Cut the 
meat of the lobster fine, and boil in the soup two 
hours. If you have the roe or coral of the lobster, 
grate it into the soup, as it adds to its tempting ap- 
pearance. Add a quarter of a pound of butter, 
braided into two taUespoonluls of flour, a cup of* 
wine, the juice of a lemon, or a tablespoonful of 
vinegar. 

New Englakp Chowdeb. — ^A good haddock, 
cod, or any other solid fish. Cut in pieces three inches 
square. Put a pound of fat salt pork cut in strips 
into a stewpan, set it on hot coals, and fry out the 
oil. Take out the pork, put in a layer of fish, 
over that a layer of onions in slices, another layer 
cd fish with Btripftof fat salt pork^ another l^er

of rniions. Alternate in this way until ypur fish 
is consumed. Mix some flour with as much water 
as will fill the pot, season with black pepper and 
salt to taste, and boil fin* half an hour. Have 
ready some crackers (Philadelphia pilot bread is 
the best) soaked in water until they are a little 
softened ; throw them into the chowder five min- 
utes before taking it ofl^ the fire. Serve in a tureen. 

Oyster Soup. — To one hundred oysters take 
one quart of milk, half a pint of water, four spoon- 
fuls of flour, half a cup of butter, and one teadi)oon- 
ful of salt, with a very little Cayenne pepper. Boil 
and skim the liquor of the oysters. Steam the flour 
and butter over the teakettle until soft enough to 
beat to a froth ; then stir it in the liquor while boil- 
ing; after which add the other ingredients, and 
throw in the oysters, allowing them merely to scald. 

Culm Soup. — Separate fifty small clams from 
the juice, which put into a ste\vpan, and let sim- 
mer five minutes, put it on to cook and slowly 
add two tablespoonfuls of butter and one of flour 
rubbed together, stirring it well ; afl^r this add half 
a teaspoonful of salt, half a nutmeg, and one pint of 
cream or milk, stir all well ; let it simmer ten min- 
utes ; chop up parsley and add the clams. One boil 
up is sufficient, as clamS require little cooking. If 
large clams are used, it Is necessary to chop them up. 

Bisque of Lobster. — ^A soup made with fish 
is always called a bisque. It is made either with

crabs or lobsters. Bemove a portion fbom either 
side of the head and use the rest. To boil a lobsteF| 
put it in a fish-kettle, and cover it with cold water, 
cooking it on a quick fire. Two lobsters will make 
soup for six or eight persons, and also salad. All 
the under shell and small claws are pounded in a 
mortar to make the bisque. "W^hen it is pounded, 
put it in a pan and set it on the fire with broth or 
water. The meat is cut in small pieces to be added 
afterwards. The bisque is left on the fire to boil 
gently for half an hour. Then pour it into a sieve 
and press it with a masher to extract the juice. To 
make it thicker a small piece of parsnip can be 
added and mashed with the rest into a pan, so that 
all the essence is extracted in that way from the 
lobster. When you have strained it, put a little 
butter with it, and add as much broth as is re- 
quired. Put some of the meat in the soup tureen, 
and pour the soup over it. 

Coloring for Soups. — As soups often requirp 
coloring, it is well to prepare browning for thai 
purpose. Two baked onions, well browned in the 
oven and then chopped fine, make an excellent 
coloring and flavoring. The shells of green peas 
dried in the oven brown, but not black, will also 
answer to brown soup, and will keep all winter if 
hung in a perfectly dry place. 

It will be found much better to use either of the 
above for coloring soup than the caramel or brown

PISH. 

To Bake a Lakge Fish WholiI — Cut off the 
heady and split the fish down ne&tly to the tail ; 
prepare a nice dressing of bread, butter, pepper and 
salty moistened with a little water. Fill the fish 
with this dressing, and bind it together with fine 
ootton cord or tape, so as to confine it; the bindings 
may be three inches apart; lay the fish on a grate 
on a bake pan or a dripping-pan, and pour round ^ 
it a little water and melted butter. Baste frequently. 
A good sized fish will bake in an hour* Serve 
with the gravy of the fish, drawn butter or oyster 
sauce. 

Rock Fish. — Rock fish or bass are best boiled 
plain, leaving on the head and tail. BqH steadily 
for half an hour. Serve with drawn butter with 
hard boiled eggs in it, chopped fine. 

Stuffed Fish. — Soak some bread in water, and 
squeeze it out, add a small onion, chopped fine,

|)ound fish, put the stuflBng in its place, and sew it 
up with a trussing needle and twine ; put a little 
salt and pepper on the fish, inside and outside, a 
few pieces of but^r u^der it in the pan, cover 
with a gill of broth, and bake in the oven. 

To Fry Trout. — ^Dry them thoroughly, and fry 
inbqt oiled butter without scorching, or in pork fat. 
If the latter rub salt on the fish. .Lay on the fish, 
before serving, lumps of sweet butter. 

Sfurgeon:— The meat of this tenant of the deep 
waters partakes very much of the properties of veal, 
both in flavor and appearance, and is of an insipid 
character unlees it is treated with condiments so as 
«, to render it commendable to the palate of the gas- 
tronomist. When purchased at the fishmonger's it 
should be cut into small fillets about one inch in 
thickness, and these should be covered over on both 
sides with a liberal supply of crumbs of bread, 
chopped^ parsley, lemon rind, and an ^g to cause 
the above to adhere to the meat. Wrap the fillets in 
clean white wmUng paper, which has been buttered 
on the inside, and place on a. gridiron over a dear 
fire until they are well done. Serve them with a 
sauce o£ melted butter, caviare and catsup, with salt 
and peppqr to taste.

in one dish some beaten yelk of egg, and in another 
Bome grated bread crumbs. Dip each slice of fish 
twice into the egg, and then twice into the crumbs. 
Fry them in fresh butter, and serve them up with 
the gravy about them. 

Halibut may be fried as above. 

Fried Eels. — Clean and skin the eels. If large 
cut them into pieces, if small skewer them round 
and fry tiiem whole. First dust them over with 
flour, then rub them with yelk of ^g and sprinkle 
them with bread crumbs. Put them into boiling 
lard and Gry until nicely lH*owned. 

Potted Salmon. — Salmon, pounded mace, 
cloves, and pepper to taste, three bay leaves, a quar- 
ter of a pound of butter. Skin the salmon, and 
clean it thoroughly by wiping with a cloth (water 
would spoil it). Cut it into square pieces, which 
rub with salt, let them remain till Uioroughly 
drained, then lay them in a dish with the other in- 
gredients, and bake. When quite done drain them 
&om tlie gravy, press into pots for use, and when 
cold pour over it clarified butter. 

To Pickle Fish. — ^Take any freshly caught fish, 
clean and scale them, wash and wipe them dry. Cut 
them .into slices a few inches thick, put them in a

To PiCBXE Herbings. — ^Wash fifty herrings well, 
and cut off their heads, tails, and fins. Put the fish 
into a stewpan, with three ounces of ground allspice, 
one tabIespo(BifQl of coarse salt, and a little Cayenne. 
Lay the fish in laycars, and strew the spice equally- 
over it, with a few bay i^ives and anchovies inteiv 
spersed. Pour ov€ar the whole a pint of vinej^ 
mixed with a little water. Tie a bladder ov^r the 
stewpan and bake in a slow oven. Skim off the 
oil, and with a little of the liquor boil abput half a 
pint of claret or port wine. The fish should be 
b9,ked so slowly and so thoroughly that when cooked 
the bones should not be perceptible. 

Salt Fish. — ^Lay the fish to soak over night in 
cold water with a little vinegar in it. Wash it thor- 
oughly, put it into a fish-kettle, with sufficient cold 
water to oovw it. Let it heat gradually, but not 
boil quickly, or the fish will become hard. A large 
fish will require to be kept boiling half an hour.

Salt Fisq with FAsmrnm^.-^'Selt fifth ttmn 
always be well soaked in plenty of cold water the 
whole of the night before it is required for the fol- 
lowing day's dinner. The salt fish must be put on 
to boil in plenty of cold water, without any salt, 
and when thoroughly done should be well drained 
free from any water, and placed on a dish with 
plenty of well-boiled parsnips. Some sauce may be 
poured over the fish, which is to be made as follows, 
viz. : Mix two ounces of butter with three ounces of 
flour, pepper, and salt, a small glassful of vinegar, 
and a good half pint of water. Stir this on the fire 
till it boils. A few hard-boiled eggs chopped up 
and mixed in this sauce would render the dish more 
acceptable. 

PiCKED-up Codfish. — ^This is an old-fashioned 
dish and name, but none the less to be admired on 
that account, being with most persons, when prop- 
erly prepared, a great fevorite. Pick up the fish in 
small particles, separating the fibres as near as pos- 
sible, the finer the better. Freshen by leaving it in 
water one hour. Pour off the water and fill up with 
fresh. Bring it to a scald, pour it off, and put on 
the fish just enough water to cover it. Add to a 
quart of the soaked fish a bit of butter the size of 
half an egg, a very little flour, and a dust of pepper. 
Beat up two eggs, and after taking off the fish thicken 
it by stirring in the egg. Some let it boil after the 
egg is «dded, but if this is done the ^g-willbe cur-

dkcL Another way is to boil eggp, chop and mix 
them in the gravy. 

Codfish Balls.— Pick up as fine as possible a 
teacup of nice white codfish. Freshen all night, or 
if wanted for any other meal than breakfast, from 
the morning. Scald it once, and drain ofi^ the water. 
Chop and work it until entirely fine. Put it in a 
basin with water, a bit of butter the size of an egg, 
and two eggs. Beat it thoroughly, and heat it until 
it thickens without boiling. It should, when all is 
mixed, be about a quart. Have some potatoes ready 
prepared and nicely mashed. Work the fish and 
potatoes thoroughly together as above, make it in flat 
cakes, and brown both sides. 

Cod Sounds (An Entree). — Boil the sounds 
gently, and not too much. Take them out of the 
water and let them remain until quite cold. Make 
a forcemeat out of chopped oysters, crumbs of bread, 
a lump of butter, spice, pepper and salt, and the 
yelks of two eggs. Fill the sounds and skewer them 
up in the shape of chickens, and lard them down 
each side in the s^me manner as though they were 
the breasts of fowls. Dredge them with flour, put 
them before the fire to bake, basting them well with 
butter. When they are sufiiciently cooked, pour 
upon them some oyster sauce. They make an excel- 
lent entrSe,

it out, press it dry, add to it an equal quantity of 
mashed potatoes, and beat together in a mortar to a 
fine paste; season to ta«te. Then make up the 
mass into round flat cakes, sift a little flour over 
each one^ and fry in butter or lard till they are 
brown. Codfish recooked in this way is an ex- 
cellent breakfast dish. 

Kedgeree. — ^Take some fish that has been 
dressed, bone it carefully, and pull it into very 
small bits. Add liard-boiled eggs chopped, and as 
much rice well boiled as you require to fill your 
dish. Mix all these well together, with sufficient 
butter or cream to moisten them, adding a little 
Cayenne, mustard, and salt. Put all into a sauce* 
pan and stir with a fork (not a spoon) until quite 
hot. The fire must not be too fierce, and the dish 
must be served up very hot. 

Lobster Patties. — Make some puff paste, and 
spread it on very deep pattypans. Bake it empty. 
Having boiled well two fine lobsters, extract all the 
meat and mince it very small, mixing with it the 
coral smoothly mashed, and some yelks of hard 
boiled eggs, grated. Season it with a little salt, 
some Cayenne, some powdered mace or nutmeg, 
adding a little yellow lemon rind, grated. Moisten 
the mixture well with cream, fresh butter, or salad 
oil. Put it into a stewpan, add a v^ Uttk watsr,

Lobster Rissoles.— Extract the meat of a 
boiled lobster, mince it as fine as possible, mix with 
it the coral, pounded smooth, and some yelks of 
hard-boiled eggs, pounded also. Season it witL* 
Cayenne pepper, potrdeiied mace, and a very little 
salt. Make a batter of beaten e^y milk, and floor. 
To eaeh egg allow two large tabl^spoonfuls of milk, 
and a large teaefKKmfiil of floor. Beat the batter 
well, and then mix the lobstar with it gradually, 
till it is stiff enough to make into oval balls about 
the size of a large plum. Fry theuL in the best 
salad oil, and serve them eitfaor warm or cold. Simi- 
lar rissoles may be made of raw oysters, minced fine, 
or of boiled dams. These should be fried in lard. 

To Fby Oystkbb- — Beat up an egg in one ves- 
sel and gyrate ooe or two crackers in another. Dip 
the oysters singly, first into the egg, then into the 
cracker. Fry the oysters so pr^>fla*ed in eqvksi parts 
of butter and lard. It is also reoonnnended to dty 
the oysters with a towel, beforehand. Clams miay 
l)e fried in the same way.

Oyster Stew. — To one hundred oysters, take 
one quart of milk, a half pint of water, four table- 
spoonfuls of flour, one teaspoonfol of salt, a half 
oup of butter and a little Cayenne pepper. Put the 
liquor of the oysters on to boil. Mix butter and 
flour and steam it in a bowl over the teakettle till 
soft enough to beat to a froth, then stir it into the 
liquor, after whieh add the <>ther ingredients. 

Gebman Beobipt for Oyster Powder. — 
Take fresh oysters, beard them, and place them in 
9 vessel over the fire for a few moments in order to 
extract the juice, then put them to cool, and chop 
them very fine with pounded biscpit, mace, and 
finely-minced lemon-peel; pound them until they 
become a paste; make them up into thin cakes, 
place them on a sheet of paper in a slow oven, and 
let them bake until they become quite hard, pound 
them directly into powder, aijd place the powder iu 
a nice, dry tin box. Keep in a dry place, wd when 
oj^ters ^a^ out of season you will find this powder 
very serviceable in imparting the ^vor of the fish 
to various sauces and dishes. 

Crumbed Oysters. — ^Eight squi^^ soda-erack*-

putting it on the OTsters at each laytr, with a dost 
of pepper; be careful not to salt too mneh, leaving 
the bottom and top layer crackers. A moment 
before baking add a coifee cup of the liquor from 
the oysters ; bake a light brown. 

ScAMiOPiSD Oysters. — ^Wash out of the liquor 
two quarts of oysters, pound very fine eight soft 
crackers, or grate a stale loaf of bread ; butter a 
deep dish, sprinkle in a layer of crumbs, then a 
layer of oysters, a little mace, pepper, and bits of 
butter; another layer of crumbs, another of oystei-s, 
then seasoning as before, and so on until the dish 
is filled ; cover the dish over with br^ad-cruinbs, 
seasoning as before ; tprn over it a cup of the oyster 
liquor. Set it into the oven for thirty or forty 
minutes to brown. 

Oyster Forcemeat. — Open carefully a dozen 
fine plump natives, take off the beards, strain the 
liquor, and rinse the oysters in it. Grate four 
ounces crumb of a stale loaf into fine light crumbs, 
minoe the oysters, but not too small, and mix them 
with the bread ; add one and a half ounce of good 
butter, broken into minute bits, the grated rind of 
half a small lemon, a small saltspoonful of pounded 
mace, some Cayenne, a little salt, and a large tea- 
spoonful of parsley; mix these ingredients well, 
and work them together with the unbeaten yelk of 
one egg, and a little oyster liquor, the remainder 
of which can be added to the sauce which usually 
aoeompanies this forcemeat.

Oybter Pattibs m Batter, — Make a batter 
with the yelk of one egg (or move, aoeording to the 
quantity of oysters you intend to prepare), a little 
nutmeg, some beaten mace, a little flour, and a 
little salt; dip in the oysters, and fry them in lard 
to a nice light brown. If preferred, a little parsley 
may be shred very fine, and mixed with die batter. 
The batier may also be made thicker, and formed 
into the shape of a patty, or put into a small tin 
mould, the oyster being dropped in and covered 
over, and the whole baked as a pudding would be. 

Oyster Omelette. — ^Three eggs well beaten, s 
little parsley, and an onion well minced, a little 
pepper and salt, one dozen good oysters ; fry in 
butter Avith a little cream. The omelette must not 
be turned, but when done on the one side must be 
browned, or held close to the fire whto it rises and 
l)rowns ; serve hot with good gravy. 

Oyster Sauce. — Boil the oysters in their own 
liquor until they look plump, then take them out 
and strain the liquor; add to it wine, vinegar, and 
pepper to your taste, and pour it over the oysters. 

Clam Fritters. — Strain the clams thoroughly 
from the juice, chop them fine, season with pepper 
and salt, and add an egg or two, with a little cream 
or milk ; sift in flour enough to make them stick 
together — ^and fry.

8AUCEB AND PIOELBB 

SiiUf*E8. — ^Melted butter, a sauce, is, in its 
simplest form, a mixture of butter, flour, salt and 
water; and the talent consists in bringing those 
ingredients togethei', and in the quantities employed 
of each. It ought not to be a mixture of flour and 
water with a little butter added to it — this is the 
common form — but, as its name implies, it ought 
to be butter and water, with a little flour added to 
it to thicken the mixture. If you like your sauce 
thick, put more flour ; and if thin, put less. To be 
well made, the sauce should be smooth and velvety 
in appearance, and, above all, devoid of what ai^ 
called knobs. To obtain this result proceed in 
this way : Melt the butter in a saucepan, and then 
add the flour, which will amalgamate very easily 
with it; salt and stir in enough of hot water, keep 
stirring the mixture on the fire until it thickens 
* then serve. 

The above is the simplest form, but like all simple 
things, it is the foundation of an imposing array of 
sauces, to be eaten with fish, flesh, fowl, and v^e- 
tables without end.

1. Beat up the yelk of an egg and the juke of a 
lemon, and stir in just before serving, off ihe jire, 

2. Use milk> or milk and water, instead of 
water. 

3. Throw in, just before serving, some chopped 
parsley, capers, or pickles chopped small. These 
additions are not incompatible with the arrange- 
ments Nos. 1 and 2. 

4. Let the butter and flour get a good brown 
color, then add water, and when the sauce is made, 
Worcester Sauce, ketchup, pepper and other spices 
and condiments to taste. 

5. Use a mixture of half water and half tomato 
sauce instead of water, and add condiments to taste, 
if the tomato sauce is not suflBciently flavored. 

N. B. — ^This is no^ to be used in dressing maca- 
roni, but only for cutlets, boiled fowls, with rice, 
various vegetables, etc, 

6. Cut up some onions, a very small piece of 
^rlic, and boil in milk, with whole pepper, mace, 
a clove or two, etc., tied up in a piece of miifJin, 
and, some parsley. When the mixture is well 
flavored, strain and use the milk instead of water 
to make your sauce ; egg and lemon may be added 
if wished. Without these last two it is not a bad 
substitute for onion sauce. Shad or rock fish 
boiled in the flavored milk, and served with the 
sauce over them, are not bad eating. The great 
rock to be avoided is excess of any one thing in 
flavoring the milk, chiefly in the spice line.

SAUCES AND TICKLES. 49 

7. For puddings and sweet dishes the sauce is 
made in the same way, excepting that the salt is 
replaced by sugar, in larger quantities, of course. 
This should be made with milk, or milk and water, 
und an egg or two used, with or without lemon, 
according to taste; or the egg should be beaten up 
with brandy or wine. 

Mushroom Catsup. — Get fine-grown, fresh 
gathered mushrooms, break fhem up, and sprinkle 
a good handful of salt over every layer. Let them 
lie for all the juice to run out, stirring them up 
often, but put no v/ater. When the juice has run 
out, strain it off, and boil it well, with very little 
ginger, and a suflBcient quantity of pepper. It is a 
mistake to give mushroom catsup all kinds of fla- 
vorings,, as it is the full flavor of the mushroom 
which it is all-important to preserve, and in using 
it the cook can add the spices her dish requires. 
All that is necessary or good to make the catsup 
keep is to put salt and pepper enough. A mat- 
ter of yet greater importance is to use the pure 
juice without water, as any mixture of water 
spoils the flavor and the keeping, too. There is 
no better sauce for fried or broiled fish than a 
really good mushroom catsup, and nothing else; 
and mixed with equal parts of soy and lemon 
pickle, it makes a delicious flavoring for any sauce 
or gravy. Make it a qiuirtette with a fourth equal 
part o£ red wine, and *' it ^s no ill," as the Scot 
says.

iO 8AUCB8 AND PIGKLBB. 

Tomato Catsup. — Take six pounds of tomatoesi 
spriukle them with salt^ let them remsun for a day 
or two^ then boil them until the skins will separate 
easily ; press them through a colander or coarse 
sieve^ leaving the skins behind. Put into the liquor 
a handful oi shalots^ a pint of Ohili vin^nr^ a pint 
of wine, salt, pepper, cloves, ginger, and alls{Ace. 
Boil all together until a third is Ti^sted, bottle it, 
and when it is cold -cork the bottles very well. 
Shake it before using it. Good either for sauce or 
for flavoring. 

Tomato Marmalade. — ^Take fine ripe toma- 
toes, cut them in halves, and squeeze out the juice. 
Put them in a preserving^pan, with a few peach- 
leaveS, a clove of garlic, some slices of onion or 
shalot, and a bundle of parsley. Stew them until 
they are sufl&ciently done, pulp them through a 
sieve^ and boil them down like other marmalade, 
adding salt. Put them into small jars, pepper the 
tops, and pour clarified butter over. Eat it with 
fish, etc., or stir the contents of a small pot into 
the gravy of stews or fricassees. 

Belsize Tomato Sauce.^— Slice tomatoes in a 
far, and sprinkle s^lt over ^very lay^ of slices. 
Place the jar in a warm place by the fire, stir the 
contents pretty ofteg for three days, and let it re- 
main untouched for twelve days. Press out the 
juice, and boil it with mace, pepper, ;ill$pice, gin- 
ger, and cloves. There should be two ounces of

i^ice to a qu^rt of juice, the pepper and allspice 
greatly predominating. At the end of three months 
it should be boiled up with fresh q>ioe. 

Tomato Vinegar. — Quarter three dozen fine 
tomatoes^ leave the bottoms undivided ; rub half 
a pound of salt over them, place them in a wide- 
mouthed jar in a cool oven, or by the side of the 
fire, for a day or two ; add a little mace, cloves, 
and grated nutmeg; slice in a clove of garlic, 
sprinkle in half a pint of mustard seed, and pour 
over all two quarts of boiling vinegar ; tie a blad- 
der over the jar, and let it remain five or six days 
more by the fire, shaking it well every day. Put 
it by in the same jar as long as convenient, and 
when you wish to bottle it press out all the liquor ; 
let it stand several hours to clear, and then bottle 
the clear, and keep that which is not quite clear for 
present use. ^ 

Tomato vinegar and tomato sauce should both 
be kept in store, as the sub-acid flavor is sometimes 
an improvement in the dishes in which it is used, 
whereas at other times we require the flavor of the 
tomato unmingled with acid. 

LEliON Pickle. — Grate ofl^ the rind of twenty 
lemons, or pare it off^so thin as to cut through the 
little globules, grating or cutting it into a s'mall 
quantity of vin^ar, to be added to the lemon pickle 
with the vinegar. Cut tHe lemons in quarters, leav- 
ing the bottoms whole. Rub over them equally

half a pound of bay salt^ and put them into a stoue 
jar in a cool oven, or on the hob by the lire, until the 
juice is dried into the peels. Then put in amongst 
them a blade of mace, a few cloves beaten fine, some 
grated nutmeg, a clove of garlic peeled and sliced, 
and half a pint of mustard seed bruised, and pour 
over all two quarts of boiling vinegar. Close the 
jar well, let it stand in its warm place five or six 
days, shaking it up every day. Tie it down tight 
with a bladder, and put it by for three months to 
take ofi^ the bitter. After this it may be bottled 
when convenient. Put all into a hair sieve, and 
squeeze out the liquor. Let the liquor stand until 
the next day, and bottle the fine. Let the remain- 
der stand two days, bottle the fine part, and repeat 
the same until all is bottled. A little will not hurt 
the color of white sauce, and it is capital for flavor- 
ing stews and ragouts, and also makes a very nice 
fish*sauce. In using it for flavoring put it in before 
the gravy is thickened, especially if cream be used, 
lest the sharpness should make it curdle. 

Chutney. — Pare and core a quarter of a pound 
of sharp apples, weigh the same quantity of toma- 
toes, raisins, figs, brown sugar, and salt. Pound 
them in a mortar, and pound and mix with them a 
quarter of an ounce of chilis or Cayenne pepper, the 
same of powdeced ginger, half an ounce each of garlic 
and shalots. Mix all well together in a large jar, 
put in three pints of vinegar and one of lemon juice, 
and stand the jar where it will be in heat amounting

to 130° Fahrenheit for a month, stirring it twice a 
day. If sour apples are not to be had, gooseberries 
will do, but not so well. The top liquor or quihi 
may be poured off and bottled. It is an excellent 
fish sauce. The thick part is the ohutuey, and 
should be put into wide-mouthed bottles. Both 
are excellent for flavoring sauces or gravies, or to 
eat as sauce. 

Brownino. — Beat fine four ounces of refined 
sugar, and put it into a very otean fiying-pan, with 
one ounce of butter. Mix them k^ther over a clear 
fire, and when the sugar froths in dissolving, hold 
the pan a little off the fire, and when the sugar is 
of a deep brown pour ii^ by degrees, little by little, 
and stirring the mixture all the time, a pint of red 
wine. 'Stir in half an ounce of allspice, six cloves, 
four shalots, peeled, a blade of mace, a wineglass of 
catsup, and the rind of a lemon. Simmer it for ten 
minutes or a quarter of an hour, pour it into a basin 
to get cold, then skim it very clean, and bottle it for 
use. It is good for any brown gravy. Browning 
is often made for present use by burning a good tea- 
spoonful of brown sugar in a large iron spoon. 
Stirred into brown gravy it gives both richness and 
color. Another browning is made by allowing flour 
to bake until it is of one uniform dark-brown color. 
It takes many days, and must be stirred about from 
time to time while doing.

buttons you can get^ and just pare off the root end^ 
but do not wash them. Place them on pewter 
dishes, so that their liquor will dry into them, and 
put them into a slow oven until they will powder. 
Beat them up in a mortar, sift the powder through 
a sieve with a little Cayenne pepper and pounded 
mace, bottle it, and keep it in a dry place. 

Fish Sauce. — ^Take half a pint of milk and cream 
together, two eggs well beaten, salt, a little pepper, 
and tlie juice of half a lemon. Put it over the fire 
and stir it constantly until it b^ns to thicken. 

Tomato Sauce, — ^Take seven pounds of ripe 
tomatoes. Skin them, put them in a preserving 
kettle, with four pounds of sugar, and boil until 
the sugar penetrates the tomatoes ; add one^pint of 
vin^ar, one ounce of cloves, and one ounce of 
ground cinnamon; boil thirty minutes, and then 
seal up close in stone jars. This will keep for 
years. 

Mushroom Sauce. — ^Half a pint of button 
mushrooms, half a pint of good beef gravy, one 
tablespoonful of mushroom catsup, thickening of 
butter and flour. Put the gravy into a saucepan, 
thicken it, and stir it over the fire until it boils. 
Prepare the mushrooms by cutting off the stalks, 
and wiping thetn free from grit and dirt; the large, 
flat mushrooms cut into small pieces will answer 
for a sauce, when the buttons are not obtainable. 
Put them into the gravy, and let them simmer very

gently for ten minutes, then add the catsup, and 
serve. When fresh mushrooms are not in season, 
the mushroom powder makes a good sauoe for 
roast meats. 

, Bread* Sauce. — Cut some bread into slices, 
adding to it some pepper, an onion, a little salt and

PICKLES. 

The general principle of pickling may be soon 
stated, although it is not universally applicable to 
all varieties. The vegetables are in the majority of 
cases placed in strong brine for some hours or daya 
This is done to extract part of the watery fluids they 
contain, for by a law well known to chemists, when 
two liquids are separated by an animal or vegetable 
membrane, ah interchange takes place; but tlie 
lighter fluid is more rapidly attracted by the heavier. 
It follows, therefore, that if vegetables are put into 
strong brine, the more fluid parts are extracted, 
and the vegetable becomes less watery than before.

Great advantage, especially in wholesale manufac* 
ture, is taken of this circumstance, for, instead of 
placing the substances in the first instance, in 
vinegar, which would be so weakened that it would 
have to be renewed at a considerable cost, the v^e- 
tables are first pickled in strong brine, and, when 
the water is extracted, they are finally preserved in 
vinegar, and bottled. As an example of this 
method of proceeding we give the following : — 

To Pickle String Beans. — String beans make 
a deservedly popular pickle, but they should not be 
more than half grown when gathered ; have them 
as much of one size as possible, and let a little of 
the stalk remain upon each. Put them int6 a brine 
strong enough for an egg to float in ; let them stay 
in it for three days, stirring occasionally; place 
them in a preserving pan, with plenty of vine 
leaves both over and under them ; cover them in 
the Brine in which they have steeped ; put some- 
thing over them to keep the steam from escaping, 
and set them jver a very slow fire until they 
turn green, but they should not be allowed to 
boil ; drain them in a sieve, and arrange them in a 
jar; pour upon them a pickle made by heating some 
of the best white wine vinegar, which you have 
flavored with mace, ginger, and pepper. If the 
beans are already proi>erly greened, the pickle may 
be employed cold, otherwise use it hot. 

Tt is needless to say that in following oat these

32 SAUCES ANT> PICKLES. 

directions the vinegar used should not be boiled in 
a copper, but, if possible, in an enamelled pan. 

Sometimes the salt is more advantageously used 
dry, as extracting the moisture of the plant more 
rapidly. The following receipt is an example of 
this mode of procedure : — 

To Pickle Red Cabbage. — Choose a medium- 
sized fresh red cabbage ; tear off the coarse outer 
leaves, quarter it^ remove the stalk, cut the cabbage 
into slices of about the third of an inch in thick- 
ness ; place it in a bowl, strew amongst it two good 
handfuls of salt ; let the whole stand for twenty- 
four hours ; stirring it once or twice ; dwlin it as dry 
as possible ; place it loosely in wide-mouthed jars, 
and fill up with either the prepared vinegar given 
above, or iise strong raw vin^ar, adding pepper- 
corns, capsicums, pieces of ginger, or what other 
spice you may &ncy. This in a day or two will 
be of a splendid crimson color, and eat deliciously 
criq). Those cooks who prefer to boil their vine- 
/ gar and spices in an iron pot, and forthwith pour 
the pickle boiling hoi upon the cabbage, may rea- 
sonably expect soon to find the latter limp, ill- 
flavored, and of a dismal purplish blue. 

The caution here given respecting the boiling the 
vinegar in an iron vessel is perfectly correct. For, 
if done, a small quantity of the metal will be dis- 
solved by the acid, and, although perfectly whole- 
a9me, alter n^terially the fine color which is so 
much esteemed in this pickle.

Pickled NAsrimTitrMS. — Yery frequently nas- 
turtiums are merely thrown into seasoned vinegar ; 
they should be gathered in sunshiny weather. Al- 
though this method answers tolerably well, it is 
preferable to put the freshly pickled nasturtiums 
into a strong brine of salt and water, and let them 
remain in this till they grow somewhat soft ; then 
«>ver them with strong vin^ar, and they will keep 
for years. 

To Pickle Cabbage a GtOod Color. — ^Put 
a few slices of beet-root amongst it — ^will find it 
makes it a very beautifiil color, besides being a nice 
addition to the pickles. 

To Pickle MusHBOOii^. — ^Rub the buttons with 
flannel and salt, throw them into a stewpan with a 
little salt over them, then sprinkle them with some 
pepper and a small quantity of ma«e. As the liquor 
comes out shake them well, and keep them over a 
gentle fire until all is dried into them again, then 
put as much vinegar into the pan as will cover them. 
Give it a scald, and pour the whole into bottles. 

Small Onion Pickle. — Small onions, not larger 
than marbles, must be carefully peeled and thrown 
into strong brine. Let them remain eight days, 
changing the brine every other day. Dry in a cloth, 
place them in bottles, add spice, and fill up with 
strong distilled vinegar. A teaspoonful of olive oil 
will prevent the onions from turning yellow. Mus-

per-coms, and maoe are all excellent spices for 
oni<ms. 

Spiced Onions. — Peel large onions and lay them 
in a jar. Put as much cider vinegar as will cover 
them in a pot, with tloves, allspice, cinnamon, maoe, 
mustard seed, horseradish. When the vinegar boils 
pour it over the onions. Let them stand twelve 
hours. Pour off the vinegar, heat to boiling point, 
and pour on again until the vinegar has been heated 
three times, when the onions will be fit for use. 

Pickled Onions. — Have the onions gathered 
when quite dry and ripe, and with the fingers take 
off the thin outside skin, then with a knife remove 
one more skin, when the onion will look quite clear. 
Have ready some very dry bottles or jars, and as 
fast as the onions are peeled put them in. Pour 
over sufficient cold vinegar to cover them, add two 
teaspoonfuls of allspice and two teaspoonfuls of black 
pepper, taking care that each jar has its share of the 
latter ingredients. Tie down with bladder, and put 
them in a dry place, and in a fortoight they will be 
fit for use. This is a most simple receipt, and very 
delicious, the onions being nice and crisp. They 
should be eaten within six or eight months after 
being done, as the onions are liable to. become soft. 

To Pickle Beet-root. — ^This vegetable makes 
an excellent pickle, and from the brightness of its 
color has a very pretty effect in a glass pickle dish 
^ jar. Wash the beet jxjrfectly. Bo not cut off

juice to escape, and thus the coloring would be lost. 
Put it into sufficient water to boil it, and when the 
skin will come off it will be sufficiently cooked, and 
may be taken out and laid upon a cloth to cooL 
Having rubbed off the skin cut the beet into thick 
slices, put it into a jar, and pour over it cold vine- 
gar, prepared as follows : Boil a quart of vinegar 
with one ounce of whole black pepper, and an equal 
weight of dry ginger, and let it stand until quite 
cold. The jar should be kept closely corked. 

Cakolina Chow-Chow. — ^The evening before 
you wish to make your pickle take the cabbage, 
chop it up fine, say a water-pailful, put a layer of 
cabbage, sprinkle with salt, and so on until the ves- 
sel is full, place a plate on it to press it down, and 
let it stand until morning. Prepare ten large onions 
in the same way, spread the cabbage on a cloth, and 
let it remain while you are preparing your vinegar. 
Take one gallon of the best vinegar and sweeten to 
your taste, put into a bowl some mustard, two 
ounces of pulverized cinnamon, two ounces of tur- 
meric, two ounces of white mustard seed, two ounces 
of celery seed, half a pint of grated horseradish, 
mix all well together in the vinegar, and let it come 
to a boil, then put in the cabbage and onions and 
let them boil about ten minutes. If too thick add 
vinegar. You can use salad oil,half a teacupful,

PiCKi^ED Walnuts, No. 1. — One hundred wal- 
nuts, salt and water. To each quart of vinegar 
allow two ounces of whole black pepper, one ounce 
of allspice, one ounce of bruised ginger. Procure 
the walnuts while young, and prick them well with 
a fork. Prepare a strong brine of salt and water 
(four pounds of salt to each gallon of water), into 
which put the walnuts, letting them remain nine 
days, and changing the brine every third day. Drain 
them off, put them on a dish, and place it in the 
sun until they become perfectly black, which will be 
in two or three days. Have ready dry jars, into 
which place the walnuts, and do not quite fill the 
jars. Boil sufficient vinegar to cover them for ten 
mumtes, with spices in the above proportion, and

poiir it hot over the walnuts, which must be quite 
covered with the pickle. Tie down with bladder 
and keep in a dry place. They will be fit for use 
in a month^ and will keep good two or three years. 

Pickled Walnuts, No. 2. — ^Take one hundred 
walnuts, soft enough to allow a needle to pass 
through them, lay them in water, with a good hand- 
ful of salt, for two days, then change to fresh water 
and another handful of salt, for three days, then 
drain and lay them on some clean straw or a sieve 
in the sun until quite black and wrinkled ; after- 
wards put into a clean, dry glass bottle or jar a quar- 
ter of an ounce of allspice, quarter of an ounce of 
mace, quarter of an ounce of ginger, half a pint of 
mustard seed, and half an ounce of pepper-corns ; 
these to be mixed in layers with the walnuts until 
your walnuts are all used, then pour over them boil- 
ing vinegar to cover them. Eeady fi)r use in two 
months. 

Sweet Peach Picskles. — ^To nine pounds of firm 
clingstone peaches (peeled) take three pounds of 
brown sugar and an ounce each of cinnamon bark, 
cloves, mace, and allspice, and a quart of good vine* 
gar. Put the sugar, vinegar, and spices in a clean 
preserving kettle, and leVit boil thououghly. Have 
the peaches in a large jar, and when the vinegar, 
sugar, and spices have been skimmed, and while 
boiling, pour over the peaches. Do this for nine 
consecutive d^ys, pouring off the liquid every morn-

ing, and boiling again and scalding tho peaches. 
Tie and put in a cool place. 

Sweet Pickle. — Select fine cantaloupe or citroii 
melons^ ripe, but firm, pare and seed them, and slice 
or quarter them. Weigh the fruit, and to five 
pounds of melon allow two and a half pounds of 
white sugar and one quart of vinegar. The vinegar 
and sugar must be heated, well skimmed, and poured 
boiling over the fruit six times. In the last boiling 
of the syrup add the spices — stick cinnamon, white 
ginger, and a few cloves — and when the syrup boils 
put in the citron and let it boil for tea mioutes, then 
put it in the Jars, skim the syrup clear, and pour 
over it. 

Sweet Tomato Pickles. — Chop one peck of 
green tomatoes, fi>ur onions, and six green peppers. 
Strew over them one cup of salt, and let them 
stand all night. Next day drain off the water from 
them, and add to them one cup of sugar (or more, 
if liked), one cup of grated horseradish, one table- 
spoonful of cinnamon, one of cloves, and one of 
allspice. Cover with vinegar and cook till tender. 

Gkeen Tomato Pickle. — Slice two gallons of 
green tomatoes, put them into a pan with a layer 
of salt, and then of tomatoes, with half a dozen of 
onions sliced, and alternately put with the toma- 
toes and salt, and let them remain in salt all night. 
The next morning rinse and drain well. Put them 
into a kettle with one gallt^iof strong cWcr ti^^

fuls of mustard, four of ground allspice, four of 
ground ginger, five of cinnamon, four of cloves, 
four of black pepper, four of celery seed, half a 
dozen red or green peppers, sliced fine, two teaspoon- 
fuls of ground mace, and four tablespoonfuls of olive 
oil. Let it boil three or four hours, then, if the 
vinegar is not as strong as it should have been, 
while the pickles are still warm, add a quart of cold 
vinegar. This pickle has been considered as good 
as " chow chow,*' and will keep for years. 

ToMAT0£8. — ^Always use those which are thor- 
oughly ripe. The small round ones are decidedly 
the best. Do not prick them, as most receipt books 
direct. Let them lie in strong brine three or four 
days, then put them down in layers in your jars, 
mixing with them small onions and pieces of horse- 
radish, then pour on the vinegar (cold), which should 
be first spiced as for peppers. Let there be a spice 
bag to throw into every pot. Cover them carefully, 
and set them by in the cellar for a full month before 
using. 

Spiced TofMATOES. — ^Two pounds of tomatoes, 
one pound of brown sugar, half a pint of good cider 
vinegar, one dozen cloves, and two dozen grains of 
allspice. Put these ingredients into a preserving 
Kettle, and stew them over a slow fire. When they 
have beep in sufficiently long to cook the tomatoes 
tcdorably well take tiiem up and place, them on a

dish to cool, but continue slowly boiling the syrup. 
When the tomatoes become cool put them back into 
the syrup and boil them until they are of a dark red 
color ; then take them out again, put them on a dish 
to cool, and continue boiling the syrup until it is as 
tliick as mdlasses. When the tomatoes and syrup 
are both cool pat it into jars and tie paper over the 
mouths. 

Mixed Pickle. — ^To each gallon of vin^ar allow 
quarter pound of bruised ginger, quarter pound of 
mustard, quarter pound of salt, two ounces of mus- 
tard seed, one and a half ounce of turmeric, one 
ounce of ground black pepper, quarter ounce of 
Cayenne, cauliflowers, onions, celery, sliced cucum- 
bers, gherkins, French beans, nasturtiums, capsi- 
ouDis. HLdLve a large jar, with a tightly fitting lid, in 
which put as much vin^ar as is required, reserving 
a little to mix the various powders to a smooth 
paste. Put into a basin the mustard, turmeric, pep- 
per, and Cayenne, Mix them with vinegar, and 
stir well until no lumps remain ; add all the ingre- 
dients to the vinegar, and mix well. Keep this 
liquor in a warm place, and thoroughly stir every 
morning for a month with a wooden spoon, when it 
will be ready for the different vegetables to be added 
to it. As these come into season have them gath 
ered on a dry day, and, after merely wiping them 
with a cloth to free them from moisture, put theoi 
into the pickle. The cauliflowers, it may be said,

into the pickle raw^ and at the end of the season, 
when there have been added as many of the vegeta- 
bles as could be procured, store it away in jars, and 
tie over with bladder. As none of the ingredients 
are boiled, this pickle will not be fit to eat till twelve 
months have elapsed. Whilst t^ pickle is being 
made, keep a wooden spoon tied to the jar; and its 
contents, it may be repeated, must be stirred every 
morning. 

Cold Catsup. — ^One half peck of tomatoes, one 
half gallon of vin^ar, half a teacup of salt, half a 
teacup of mustard seed, ground or broken, four podsr 
of red pepper, cut very fine, one teacup of grated 
horseradish, two tablespoonfuls of ground pepper, 
two tablespoonfuls of celery seed. A ftcr peeling and 
mashing up the tomatoes the whole must be well 
mixed, put into bottles, and corked tightly. ,It is 
soon ready for use. 

Pepper Catsup. — Fifty pods of large red pep- 
pers, with the seeds. Add a pint of vinegar, and 
boil until the pulp will mash through a sieve. Add 
to the pulp a second pint of vinegar, two spoonfuls 
of sugar, cloves, mace, spice, onions, and salt. Put 
all in a kettle and boil to a proper consistency.

CHAPTER IV. 

MEATS. 

Stewed Beep. — ^A ramp of ten jounds weight 
will require three hours' stewing. At first, it may 
be slowly but partly boiled, after which it is to 
simmer very slowly indeed. Have a saucepan, not 
over large, for the meat^ and, at the bottom, fix two 
skewers, to prevent the meat touching the pan. 
Pour over it one pint and a half of cold water at 
the sides, two or three onions — ^if not very large — 
partly in pieces, and on the top put as many carrots 
as you may wish, cut into good-sized dice. Before 
dishing the meat, you must thicken the gravy as 
usual with flour and a little burnt sugar, to make 
the gravy (of which there should be a good deal) 
brown. 

Rump op Beep. — ^This Is one of the most juicy 
of all the joints of beef, but is more frequently stewed 
than roasted. As it is generally too large to servcf 
Whole, cut as much from the chump end as will 
make a handsome roast. Manage it as the sirloin* 
When boned, roll it into the form of a fillet of veal, 
and l^ke.

and put into a frying pan with plenty of batter, 
boiling hot. When fried quite tender, push to the 
back of the pan. Season a tender loin of beef with 
pepper and salt, put it on the pan, and cook till 
done. Put the onions over it, and pour in the pan 
suflBoient boiling water to make a rich gravy. Let 
all stew five minutes, and serve. 

Beep Stewed with Onions. — Cut some tender 
beef into small pieces, and season with pepper and 
salt ; slice some onions and add to it, with water 
enough in the stewpan to make a gravy. Let it 
stew slowly till the beef is thoroughly cooked, then 
add some pieces of butter rolled in flour, enough to 
make a rich gravy. Cold beef may be cooked in 
the same way, but the onions must then be cooked 
before adding them to the meat. Add more water 
if it dries too fiist, but let it be boiling, when 
poured in. 

Brisket of Beef Stuffed. — A piece weigh- 
ing eight pounds requires about five or six hours to 
boil. Make a dressing of bread crumbs, pepper, 
salt, sweet herbs, a little mace, and one onion 
chopped fine and mixed with an ^g. Put the 
dressing between the fet and the lean of the beef, 
and sew it up tightly ; flour a cloth, pin the beef in 
it, as closely pressed as possible, and boil five or six 
hours. Remove the cloth, and press the meat until 
it is cold. Cut in thin slices, and eat cold. Ex- 
cellent for sandwiches. 

A LA MODE Beef. — Prepare a dressing with

:iCEATS. 81 

bread or crackers^ moisten with water seasoned 
with Imtter, |>ep{>er, salt, nutmeg, cloves, and, if 
relished, allspice; add two eggs, and mix the whole 
well together. Have ready a round of beef of the 
proper size ibr the family ; cut gashes in it, and fill 
them with the dressing. Bind it together with 
skewers, and put it in a bake-pan with water 
enough to cover the bottom of the pan, in which is 
dissolved a little salt. Baste it three or four times 
with the salted water while cooking. Let it stew 
gently. When nearly done, cover it with dressing 
reserved for the purpose. Heat Uie lid to the pan 
sufficiently hot to brown it, cover and stew until 
done. It can be stewed in a dripping-pan, in a 
stove-oven, and browned when done hy holding 
over it, if n(^ already browned, a heated shovel. 
The dressing should be poured over it half an hour 
before taking it from the pan. 

Beef Cutlets. — Cut the inside of a sirloin or 
rump in slices half an inch thick; trim them neatly; 
melt a little butter in a frying-pan ; season the cut- 
lets ; fry them lightly ; serve with tomato sauce. 

Fillet op Beef with Mushrooms. — Cut tho 
fillet into slices, and pour over them some melted 
butter, seasoned with pepper and salt; let them 
stand for an hour ; then put them in a frying pan 
over a quick fire, to brown lightly ; take them out, 
and put in the pan flour enough to thicken and 
brown, mix smoothly^ add some stocky and some

mushrooms half stewed or parboiled ; pat the fiUel 
back and cook all togeiJier till done. When ready 
to serve, squeeze in the juice of a lemon. The 
gravy should be smooth and thick. 

This dish is good substituting tomatoes for mush- 
rooms, and may be varied by using wine instead of 
lemon-juice. 

Fillet of Beep. — ^Take the sirloin or second 
cut of the ribs; take out the bones with a sharp 
knife, skewer it round in good shape ; lay the bones 
in a large saucepan, with two onions, one carrot and 
a dozen cloves; add the meat^ just covered with 
water. Let it cook slowly two hours; dish the 
meat ; skim all the &.t from the gravy, add some 
flour mixed with cold water, and two spocmfuls of 
walnut catsup ; ^ve all one boil. Turn part of the 
gravy over the meat, and serve the rest in a gravy 
tureen. 

English Beef Pie. — Cut cold roast beef, or 
beefsteak into thin slices, and put a layer in a deep 
pie dish ; shake in a little flour, pepper and salt ; 
chop a tomato or an onion very fine, and spread on 
this. Another layer of beef and seasoning, another 
onion, and so on, until the dish is filled. Add beef 
gravy, or dripping, and water sufficient to make a 
gravy. Mash one dozen large potatoes, with half 
a teacup of milk or cream, and a little butter and 
salt. Spread this over the beef as a crust, an 
inch thick. Brush with beaten e^ and bake 
half an hour.

MEATP. 83 

Beefsteak Pie. — Cover the bottom of a deep 
plate with paste. Cut the beef in pieces convenient 
for the mouth ; spread them evenly over the paste ; 
then add butter, flour, pepper, salt and water; 
cover with paste, press the edges firmly, and cut a 
gash in the centre of the pie ; it is good cold or hot. 
If to be used cold, make a gravy by boiling a bit 
of the bone, seasoning it the same as the pie ; heat 
the gravy, and serve it with the pie. Potatoes are 
all the vegetables needed — they should be mashed. 
These pies can be made from cold beefsteak left the 
day before, but are not quite as good. 

Beefsteak Pudding. — ^Prepare a good suet 
crust, and line a cake tin with it ; put in layers of 
raw steak, with onions, tomatoes and mushrooms,* 
chopped fine, a seascming of pepper, salt and 
Cayenne, and half a cup of cold water. Cover with 
crust, and bake two hours. Serve very hot. 

Beefsteak Smothered with Onions. — Cut 
up six onions very fine> put them into a saucepan 
with two cupfuls of hot water, about tMjo ounces of 
good butter, some pepper and salt; dredge in a 
little flour. Let it stew until the onions are quite 
soft; then have the steak broiled; put it into the 
saucepan with the onions ; let it simmer about ten 
minutes, and send to the table very hot. 

Minced Beef. — ^Take the lean of some cold 
roast bee£ Chop it very fine, adding a small

mincefl onion ; and season it with pepper and salt 
Put it into a stewpan, with some of the gra\y that 
has been left from the day before, and let it stew for 
a quarter of an hour. Then put it (two-thirds full) 
into a deep dish. Fill up the dish with mashed 
potatoes, heaped high in the centre, smoothed on the 
sur&ce, and browned with a salamander or a red- 
hpt shovel. 

Beef Balus. — ^Mince very finely a piece of tender 
beef, lat and lean; mince an onion, with some 
boiled parsley; add grated bread crumbs, and 
season with pepper, salt, grated nutmeg, and lemon 
peel; mix all together, and moisten with a well- 
beaten egg ; roll into balls ; flour, and fry them in 
•boiling beef dripping. Serve with fried bread 
crumbs, or a thickened beef gravy. 

Mock Venison of Corned Beef. — Cut the 
)>eet in thin slices, and freshen by soaking for three 
or four hours in tepid water. When sufficiently 
fresh, lay the slices on a gridiron, and heat through 
quickly. i/Lake a gravy of drawn butter ; add a 
little pepper, and the yelk of an egg chopped fine, 
and pour over the meat ; or butter, pepper and salt, 
like beefsteak. This will be found a savory dish 
when only salt meat can be procured, but is better 
with fresh beef. 

Hash Balls of Corned Beef. — Prepare the 
hash by mincing with potatoes ; make it into flat 



Digitized by VjOOQ IC 



MEATS. 85 

cakes; heat t^e griddle, and grease it with plenty 
of sweet butter ; brown the balls first on one side, 
and then on the other, and serve hot. 

Yorkshire Pudding, with Roast Beef. — 
Five tablespoonfiils of flour mixed with one of 
salt, one pint of milk, and three well-beaten eggs. 
Butter a square pan, and put the batter in it ; set it 
in the oven until it rises and is slightly crusted on 
top ; then place it under your beef roasting before the 
fire, or in the oven, and baste it as you do your meat. 

Corned Beef, Boiled. — Wash it thoroughly, 
and put it in a pot that will hold plenty of water. 
The water should boil when the beef is put in, and 
gr<iatcare should be taken to skim it often. Half 
an hour for every pound of meat is suflBcient tin^e. 
Corn beef, to be tender and juicy, should boil veiy 
gently and long. If it is to be eaten cold, take it 
from the pot when boiled, and lay it in an earthen 
dish or pan, with a piece of board upon it, the size 
of the meat. Upon this put a heavy stone or 
couple of flat irons. It greatly improves salt meat 
to press it. 

Corned Beef Hash. — The best hash is made 
from boiled corned beef. It should be boiled very 
tender, and chopped fine when entirely cold. The 
potatoes for hash made of corned beef are the better 
for being boiled in the pot liquor. When taken 
from the pot, remove the skins from the potatoes, 
and when cold chop them fine. To a cup of

86 MEATS. 

chopped meat allow four of chopped potatoes ; stir 
the potatoes gradually into the meat, until the 
whole is mixed. Do this at evening, and, if warm, 
set the hash in a cool place* In the morning pui 
the pan on the fire with a lump of butter as large 
as the bowl of a tablespoon ; add a dust of pepper, 
and if not suflSciently salt, add a little ; usually none 
is needed. When the butter has melted, put the 
hash in the pan ; add four tablespoons of water, 
and stir the whole together. After it has become 
really hot, stir it from the bottom, cover a plate 
over it, and set the pan where it will merely stew. 
This is a moist hash, and preferred by some to dry 
or browned hash. 

^ Pickling Beef. — Rub a quarter of a pound 
of saltpetre and a little brown sugar on the beef; 
the following day season it with half a pound of 
bay salt, one ounce of black pepper, one ounce of 
allspice. Let the beef lie in pickle fourteen days, 
turning it every day, adding a little common salt 
three times per week ; then wash it, and put it into 
a glazed earthen pipkin, deep enough to cover it. 
Lay beef suet under it; add one pint of water, cover 
the top with paste and then paper, or with a plate 
instead of paste. Bake seven hours in an oven ; 
pour off the liquor, but do not cut till cold. Will 
keep three months. 

Potted Ox-Tongue. — ^Broil tender and un- 
Rmoked tongue of good flavor, and the following

MEATS. 87 

day cut from it the quantity desired for potting, or 
take for this purpose the remains of one which has 
already been servedat table. Trim off the skin and 
rind, weigh the meat, mince it very small, then 
pound it as fine as possible, with four ounces of but- 
ter to each pound of tongue, a small teaspoonful of 
mace, half as much of nutmeg or cloves, and a 
tolerably high seasoning of Cayenne. After the 
spices are well beaten with the meat, tar.te it, and 
add more if required. A few ounces of any well- 
roasted meat mixed with the tongue, will give it 
firmness. The breasts of turkeys, fowls, partridges, 
or pheasants may be used for this purpose with 
good effect. 

Tongue Toast. — ^Take cold tongue that has 
been well boiled, mince it fine, mix it with cream, 
or a little milk, if there is no cream at hand ; add 
the beaten yelk of an egg, and give it a simmer 
over the fire. Toast nicely some thin slices of stale 
bread, and having buttered them, lay them in a 
flat dish that has been heated before the fire ; then 
cover each slice with the tongue mixture, which 
should be kept quite hot, and serve up imme- 
diately. 

Tongue, after it hjoi been boiled, out into thick 
slices, and stewed in a rich, brown gravy, makes a 
very nice corner-dish. 

Spiced Tkipe. — ^Take fresh tripe, cut it up in 
pieoes fi>ur or five inches square ; take an earthen

jar, put in a layer of tripe, then sprinkle a fe\9 
cloves, allspice, and peppers (whole) over it ; then 
another layer of tripe, then spice, and so on till the 
jar is full ; take good vinegar, scald it, pour over 
it, filling ike jar full ; cover it up and stand it away 
in a cool place for a few days, until it tastes of the 
spice, then serve it up cold for supper or any other 
meal. It is an excellent relish. 

Potted Beef. — Salt three pounds of lean beef, 
with half a pound of Salt, and half an ounce of salt- 
petre. , Let it stand three days. Divide it into 
pieces weighing a pound each, and put it in an 
earthen pan of just sufficient size to contain it; pour 
over it half a pint of water, cover it close with 
paste, and set it in a slow oven fbr four hours. 
When taken from the oven, pour the gravy into 
a basin, shred the meat fine, moisten it with the 
gravy poured fVom the meat, and pound it thor- 
oughly in a marble mortar, with fresh butter, until 
it becomes a fine paste ; season it with black pepper 
and allspice, ground cloves, or grated nutmeg ; put 
it in pots, press it down as closely as possible, put a 
weight on it, and let it stand all night; next day, 
cover it a quarter of an inch thick with clarified 
butter, and tie paper over it. 

Bubble and Squeak. — ^Take from a round of 
cold, boiled beef, one pound and a half of meat cut 
in thin slices, two carrots which have been boiled 
with die meat, cold, and the hearts of two bcakd

chop the vegetables together ; pepper and salt the 
whole, and fry in a pan with a quarter of a pound 
of sweet butter. When fully cooked, toss into the

potatoes. 

Beep Cakes, No. 1. — Pound some beef that is 
under-done with a little fat bacon or ham ; season 
with pepper, salt, and a little shallot or garlic; mix 
them well, and make into small cakes three inches 
long, and half as wide and thick ; fry them a light 
bro>yn, and serve them in a good thick gravy. 

Beef Cakes, No. 2. — ^Take the best sirloin of 
beef, one pound; boil it until soft; boil also a 
beef tongue until soft. Take one pound of 
tongue, cTiop it and the sirloin very fine, with 
quarter of a pound of suet, and quarter of a pound 
of raisins. After you have made them as fine as 
you can, add pepper and salt to taste, also one 
teaspoonful of cloves, one teaspoonful of allspice, 
one onion chopped fine, one tablespoonful of flour. 
Mix all well together, form into cakes, and icy in 
butter. 

Beep Croquettes. — Mince some dressed beef 
very fine; melt a piece of butter in a stcwpan, add 
three or four onions chopped fine, and fried a light 
brown ; add a spoonful of flour, and moisten with 
gravy or stock, season with pepper, salt, nutmeg 
and chopped parsley. When thq sauce is cooked,

batter hot, but not boiling or tiie balls will break. 
Pat each ball gentlj into the fiying-pan, shaking a 
little floar over them; roll them about gently in 
the pan, to brown evenly, and when a good color, 
drain and sarve on dressed parsley. 

To Roll Loin of Mutton. — Hang the mutton 
till tender, bone it, and lay a seasoning of pepper, 
allspice, mace, nutm^, and a few cloves, all in fine 
powder over it. Next day prepare a stuffing; 
beat the meat, and cover it with the stuffing ; roll 
it up tight and tie it. Half bake it in a slow oven; 
let it grow cold ; take off the fiit, and put the gravy 
into a stewpan ; flour the meat, and put it in like- 
wise ; stew it till almost ready ; and add a glass of 
port-wine, some catsup, and a little lemon pickie 
half an hour before serving ; serve it in the gravy, 
with jelly sauce. 

Pannbd Mutton. — Remove all the fat from 
mutton cutlets, and trim neatly. Set them in 
melted butter, luke-warm, with pepper and salt 
Dip each into beaten yelk of egg, and afterwards 
in grated bread crumbs^ Repeat the dipping till 
the cutlets are well covered with cnimbs. Broil 
on a gridiron over a clear fire for ten minutes. 
Serve plain or with sauce, as pre&rred. 

Mutton Cutlets. — ^The most economical way 



Digitized by VjOOQ IC 



HSATB. 91 

of prooeediDg is to purchase a piece of the best end 
of a neck of mutton and divide and trim your 
chops at home. Every particle t)f gristle and 
almost all the fat should be removed from each 
cutlet, the bone or rib should not be more than 
two inches long^ from the cutlet itself or ^'nut/' and 
it should be scraped quite dean. Saw the bone at 
-the end, as it looks badly chopped. Cut the meat 
about one-third of an inch thick, prepare neatly, 
and beat gently with the flat side of a meat chopper ; 
you may cook them plain or crumbed. 

The plain process consists in broiling them on 
the gridiron over or in front of a clear fire. The 
Are should be a brisk one, and the cutlets should 

»e turned quickly and frequently while cooking. 

Chey should be thoroughly cooked, but not kept 

x)oking till hard and tough. 

Plain cutlets may also be fried in butter and 
lard. Crumbed cutlets require more trouble to 
prepare. The streak of meat with the fat and 
gristle which adheres to the bone need not be cut 
off, but detatched from the bone, and turned up 
on the side of the " nut." Smear the cutlet thickly 
with well beaten egg, and dip several times in 
bread crumbs till thickly covered. Fry in buttar 
and lard. 

Cutlets may be 8«*ved in a plain, clear gravy, or 
Vith tomato or mushroom sauce. 

Mutton cutlets may also be ste^ved in a variety 
of ways, of which the following may. be taken as

the common form : Put some butter in a stewpan, 
and pla(« your cutlets in this, turning them over 
aud over until they are well saitdes (seized) by the 
butter ; then add a small quantity of well^flavored 
stock or gravy, and let them simmer in this till 
done, when they are served with the gravy, which 
you thicken, if necessary, with a little flour, over 
them. Vegetables may be cooked with the cutlets, 
and served with them, or a garniture of vegetables, 
cooked separately, can be put round the dish. 

Mutton Cutlets a la Bene. — ^Take six 
chops from the best end of a neck of mutton, and 
afl;er sawing off the ends, braise them until they 
are tender. Put them aside to cool. Make a 
thick, rich onion sauce, season it well, and run it 
through a sieve ; then take Ae braised chops, when 
they are perfectly cold, and cut them into cutlets, 
and trim them into a proper shape. Dip each 
cutlet into the onion sauce, then into bread cruml)s, 
and afterwards into egg and bread crumbs. Fry 
them in boiling lard, a light brown color ; dmin 
them well, and serve with or without tomato sauce* 

Shoulder op Mutton. — ^A shoulder of mutton 
weighing six pounds requires one hour and thirty 
minutes to roast ; if stuffed, fifteen minutes longer. 
Before cooking, take out all the bone and fill the 
space with a dressing of bread crumbs, pep|)er, salt, 
parsley, sweet maijoram, one egg and a small p»«oe 
of butter, all well mixed.

MEATS. 95t* 

Mutton prepared like Venison. — Choose a 
large leg of mutton, and let it hang in a cool place 
ten days* Prepare a good forcemeat, and make a 
deep slit near the bone at the fillet end. Pat iu 
the forcemeat and sew over it a piece of linen to 
keep it in. Koast for two hours and thirty minutes. 
Make a gravy with the shank bone, one pound of 
soup beef, one onion, a few whole peppers, salt, and 
a pint and a half of water. Let this simmer for 
two hours. Add a dessertspoonful of flour to thicken 
it ; a little burnt sugar, if not dark enough in color, 
and more seasoning if necessary. When the meat is 
done, remove the linen cloth, strain part of the 
gravy over it, and serve. The remainder of the 
gravy should be served in a gravy-boat Currant 
jelly should always b^ served with this dish. 

Saddle op Mutton, a la Portugx7esb.-^To 
make this dish to look well, the saddle should be 
so carved as to have the sides left. When cold, 
the fillet, or undercut, and surplus meat is to be 
removed and cut small, and placed in a stewpan, 
with a little thickened gravy, mushroom catsup, 
pepper and salt. It should not be allowed to boil, 
but when hot should be placed on the saddle in the 
space from which the meat has been cut, and 
sprinkled over with bread crumbs. It must he 
levelled to the sides, and placed iu the oven. If 
the bread crumbs are not brown enough, a sala- 
mander must be made hot, and placed over it; 
it should be served very hot with currant jelly.

HSATS. 



COLD MUTTON, 



There are not many people who object to eating 
cold beef, but there seems to lie a popular prejudice 
against cold mutton. As far as looks go, when two 
or three persons have dined off a 1^ of mutton the 
day before, no amount of parsley, be it ever so curly 
and fresh, can make it look nice ; but as a matter 
of taste cold meat, be it beef or mutton, is by no 
means devoid of merit at certain seasons, and with 
a proper accompaniment of salads, pickles, and 
sauces. Only to be perfect a cold joint should not 
be touched until it is cold ; the joint of yesterday's 
dinner is quite a different affiiir. It is not every- 
body who can indulge, however, in such niceties of 
taste. Given a 1^ of mntto^ it must be used, and 
made to go as far as possible to furnish the second 
and even the third day's dinner. 

If you wish to be very economical with a 1^ of 
mutton you should carve it pretty much as you do 
a ham, then the next day put it for twenty minutes 
into a vessel containing boiling water, take it out and 
sprinkle some salt and a little flour over it, and put 
it to roast for twenty minutes before a good fire, 
basting frequently with some dripping, melted for 
the purpose. The result will be a very fair second 
edition of roast leg of mutton. Some, however, may 
object to carving mutton after the feshion of ham, 
and in that case a hash or a mince are the only 
ways of turning cold mutton to account; but there 



Digitized by VjOOQ IC 



are manj ways of hashing matton and other meatSi 
and of mincing them^ too. 

The great desideratum of a second-hand dish, so 
to speak, is that it should not taste as such. Noth- 
ing is more abominable than the bad taste which is 
so prominent in the attempts at warming up cold 
meat, which your plain cook is pleased to call 
minced veal, hashed mutton, etc. The only means 
to avoid that taste is to remove careiuUy from the 
cold meat you are going to use every part that has 
seen the fire, as well as gristle and fat. Let every 
slice be carefully trimmed, and let them all be as 
near as possible similar in size and shape; then 
make your hash, and, even if you are not an expert 
at combining sauces and spices, at any rate it will 
not have a warmed-up taste. The following are 
various formulas for warming up mutton and other 
meats: 

Cut an onion in slices and fry it in butter till it 
assumes a deep brown color, then put in a table- 
spoonful of floor, and when it is well amalgamated 
with the butter add a little less than half a pint of 
stock broth, or even water previously warmed. Stir 
a few minutes on the fire, and then proceed to flavor 
your sauce with walnut or mushroom catsup, tonaato 
sauce, spices, and pepper and salt, in such propor- 
tions as taste may suggest and practice will teach. 
A little burnt onion browning may be put in if the 
sauce is not of a sufficiently deep color. When the 
flavoring is completed, strain the sauce tlirough .9

fine ooian^r into a saucepan and place in it joust 
slices of meat. Keep the saucepan at a moderate 
heat till it is time to- serve, and send up your hash 
with a garland of bread sippets fried in butter round 
it. The longer the meat lies in the sauoethe better 
will your dish be. 

Proceed a« in t^e above receipt as far as the butter^ 
flour, and onions are concerned ; then add to your 
sauce a moderate allowance of mustard ; then add 
the stock und a wineglassful of white or red wine. 
Season with catsup, spices, pepper, and salt. Strain 
and put in the meat, serving with pickles or not, 
according to taste. Beef and pork are best warmed 
up in this way. 

A homely mode of warming cold meat is in this 
wise : Fry some slices of onipn in butter, and when 
they begin to take color put in your slices of meat, 
pepper, salt, and a sprinkling of flour. Keep on 
frying till the onions are thoroughly done and the 
meat warmed, then add a small quantity of stock, 
broth, or water, with a small quantity of vinegar, 
and s«pve. 

Minced pareley may be added to any of the above 
dishes with advantj^. 

If the state g£ the joint you have to work upon 
will allow it, cut your slices the thickness of your 
finger, trim them all nicely, as near as possible the 
same shape, then dip them in egg, and cover them 
with a mixture of bread crumbs, powdered, sweet 
lierb^, {)e}>per> and salt in due proportion. Let thera 



Digitized by VjOOQ IC 



rest a couple of hours, and egg sxkd bread crmnb 
them again 5 then fry tliem in plenty of lard till 
tliey are a nice ccdor. Serve cither alone with fried 
parsley as an ornament, or ^vith any saace, such as 
tomato, etc., which taste may suggest* Cold veal 
or (wrk treaited in this way makes a very toothsome 
- dish. 

Of course it is necessary to carry out these warm- 
ings-up, that the cold joint should not have been 
too heavily punished when it first appearecl on the 
dinner table. When a joint has not enough left 
upon it to cut nice slices, then mincing is the best 
way to utilize it. 

Minced Mutton. — This is a very useful prepa- 
ration of " cold mutton,^' and will be found an ex- 
cellent mode. Cut slices off a cold roasted leg of 
mutton and mince it very fine ; brown some flour 
in butter, and moisten it with some gravy ; add salt 
and pepper to taste, and let it simmer about ten or 
fifteen minntes to take off the raw taste of the flour; 
add another lot of butter and some parsley chopped 
fine, then add the minced meat, and let it simmer 
slowly, but not to boil, or the meat \nl\ be hard. 

Baked Minced Mutton. — The remains of any 
joint of cold roast mutton, one or two onions, one 
bunch of savory herbs, pepper and salt to taste, two 
blades of pounded mace or nutmeg, one teacupful 
of gi'avy, mashed potatoes. Mince an onion rather 
fine, and fry it a light-brown color ; add the herbs 
Bad -minttooi both ^l^'wbJab thould be aki^ finely

98 lOBASa 

minced aud well mixed ; season with pepper and 
Bait, and a little pounded mace or nutmeg, and 
moisten with the above proportion of gravy. Put 
a layer of mashed potatoes at the bottom of a dish, 
then the mutton, and then another layer of potatoes, 
aud bake for about half an hour. If there should 
be a large quantity of meat, use two onions instead 
of one. 

Browxed Minced Mutton.— Cut some lean^ 
meat from a roast leg of mutton, chop it fine, season 
it witli pepper and salt, chopped parsley, and a little 
onion ; mix all together with a quarter of a pound of 
grated bread, moisten with a tablespoonful of vine- 
gar and a cup of good gravy ; when put into the 
dish lay an ounce of butter in small bits on the top, 
grate bread over it, and add a little more butter; 
brown before the fire. 

HOW TO COOK LAJklB. 

To Roast Lamb. — ^The hind quarter of lamb 
usually weighs from seven to ten pounds ; this size 
will take about two hours to roast it. Have a brisk 
fire. It must be very frequently basted while roast- 
ing, and sprinkled with a little salt, and dredged 
all over with flour, about half an hour before it is 
done. 

Fore Quarter of Lamb. — ^A fore quarter 
of a lamb is cooked the same w^ay, but takes rather 



Digitized by VjOOQ IC 



MkAM. 9ff 

because it is ft thinner joint ; one of nine pounds 
ought to be allo^ved two hours. 

Leg op Lamb. — ^A leg of lamb of four pound.^^ 
weight will take about an hour and a quarter ; if 
five pounds, nearly one hour and a half ; a shoulder 
of four pounds will be roasted in an hour, or a very 
few minutes over. 

Ribs of Lamb. — Ribs of lamb are thin, and 
require great care to do gently at first, and brisker 
ns it is finishing; sprinkle it with a little salt, and 
dredge it slightly with flour, about twenty minutes 
before it is done. It will take an hour or longer, 
according to thickness. 

Garnish and Vegetables for Roast Lamb. 
—All joints of roast lamb may be garnished with 
double parsley, and served up with either asparagus 
and new potatoes, spring spinach and new jxitatocs, 
green peas and new potatoes, or with cauliflowers or 
French beans and potatoes; and never forget to 
send up mint sauce. The following will be found 
an excellent receipt for mint sauce: With three 
heaped tablespoonfuls of finely-chopped young mint, 
mix two of pounded and sifted sugar, and six of the 
best vinegar ; stir it until the sugar is dissolved. 

To Stew a Breast op Lamb. — Cut it into 
pieces, season them with pepper and salt, and stew 
them in weak gravy; when tender, thicken llie 
sauce, and add a glass of white wine. Cucumbers, 
slioed and stewed in gravy, may be served with the 



Digitized by VjOOQ IC 



too MlUktV^ 

lamb, the same being poured over it. Or, tlio 
lamb may be served iu a dish of stewed moshrooms. 

To BoiT. A Neck or Breast of Lamb. — ^These 
are small, delicate joints, and therefore suited only 
for a very small fiimily. The neck must be^vashed 
in warm vv^ater, and all the blood carefully cleaned 
away. Either of these joints sliould be pat into 
cold water, well skimmed, and very gently boiled 
till dotie. Half an hour will be about sufficient for 
either of them, reckoning froqa it^e time they oom^ 
to a boil. 

Lamb Chops. — Take a loin of lamb, cut chops 
from it half an inch thick, retaining the kidney in 
its place; dip ihem into egg and bread crumbs, fry 
and serve with fried parsley. When chops are 
made from a breast of lamb, the red bone at the 
edge of the breast should be cut oflF, and the breast 
parboiled in water or broth, with a sliced carrot 
and two or three onions, before it is divided into 
cutlets, which is done by cutting between every 
second or third bone, and preparing them, in every 
respect, as the last. If house-lamb steaks are to be 
done white — stew them in milk and water till very 
tender, with a bit of lemon-peel, a little salt, some 
pcp{)er and mace. Have rejidy some veal gravy, 
and put the steaks into it ; mix some mushroom- 
powder, a cup of eream, and tlie least bit of flour; 
shake the steaks iu this liquor, stir it, and let it get 



Digitized by VjOOQ IC 



quite hot, but not boil. Just before you take it up, 
put in a few white mushrooms. 

Lamb Cutlets axd Spinach. — ^Eight cutlets, 
egg and bread crumbs, salt and pepper to taste, a 
little clarified butter. Take the cutlets from a neck 
of lamb, and shape them by cutting off the thick 
part of the chine-bone. Trim off most of the fat 
and all the skin, and scrape the top part of the 
bones quite clean. Brush the cutlets over with egg, 
sprinkle them with bread crumbs, and season with 
pepper and salt. Now dip them into clarified but- 
ter, sprinkle over a few more bread crumbs, and 
fry them over a sharp fire, turning them when re- 
quired. Lay them before the fire to drain, and 
arrange them on a dish with spinach in the centre, 
which should be previously well boiled, drained, 
chopped, and seasoned. Peas, asparagus, or beans 
may be substituted for the spinach. 

Lom, Neck, and Bbeast op Lamb. — A loin 
of lamb will be roasted in about an hour and a 
quarter ; a neck in an hour ; and a breast in three- 
quarters of an hour. Do not forget to salt and 
fiour these joints about twenty minutes before tliey 
are done. 

Broiled Lamb Steak. — Broil slowly until 
quite done, then make a gravy with fresh butter 
melted by the steak, add a dust of pepper, and a 
little salt dissolved in a tablespoonful of water; 
$erve with peas, potatoes, and salads. , >

l^a OF Lamb to Boil. — ^It most be put into 
boiling water, then the saucepan (or deep fish-kettle 
with a drainer is best) drawn back, and the water 
allowed to simmer gently, reckoning eighteen 
minutes to each pound ; if it boils &st, the meat 
will be hard and the skin broken. It should be 
lifted out of the water with the drainer, and no fork 
be stuck into it; if the scum has settled upon it, 
wash it off with some of the liquor before sending 
to table. Parsley and butter are served with this, 
or delicate caper sauce and young carrots. 

Leo op Lamb to Roast. — ^All lamb should be 
very well cooked, and not put too near the fire at 
first ; from eighteen to twenty minutes to the pound 
before a clear but not fierce heat. It may be served 
with spinach, peas, or asparagus. 

3oNED Quarter of Lamb. — Bone a quarter of 
lamb, taking care not to injure the skin. Make a 
seasoning in the following manner : Cut three 
onions and fry them in lard; when these are nearly 
done, add some parsley, chopped very fine, spice, 
two spoonfuls of cream, and four eggs. Simmer 
this mixture over the fire until quite thick, then 
stuff it into the meat in the spaces left by the bones, 
roll the meat up and roast it, basting with bread 
crumbs and butter. Serve with a rich sauce. 

Fricasbkb of Lamb. — Cut the best part of a 
breast of lamb into square pieces of two inches 
each; wash, dryi and flour them. Boil together

chop an onion ^vith pepper and salt and throw in. 
Simmer all for two hours ; add the jelks of two 
eggs well beaten^ shake oTer the fire two minutes/ 
and serve. 

Savory Lamb Pie. — Cut the meat into pieces, 
and season it with finely-beaten pepper, salt, mace, 
cloves, and nutmeg. Make a good pufi-paste, and 
put the meat into it, adding some lambs' sweet- 
breads, seasoned in the same manner. Put in some 
oysters and forcemeat balls, some yelk of egg, and 
tops of asparagus, boiled gr^n. Put butter all 
over the pie, and put on the covering paste, and let 
it bake for an hour and a half in a quick oven. 
Mix a pint of gravy, the oyster liquor, a gill ^ 
wine, and a little nutmeg, with the yelks of two or 
three eggs well beaten, and stir it in the same direc- 
tion all the time. When it boils, take the cover ofiF 
the pie, pour the mixture into it. Cover again and 
serve. 

Stewed Breast op Lamb, wtth Peas or Cu- 
i:;u^rBEHS. — First roast the lamb to a nice brown 
color. Mix a tablespoonful of flour smoothly in 
cold water, burn a teaspoonful of sugar in an iron 
spoon, pour boiling water over it into the flour, 
mix all smoothly; strain it; add as much boiling 
water as will barely cover the meat, putting it into

French beans or peas, if very tender, are an im- 
provement. 

Larded Lamb. — ^Lard the upper side of a fore 
quarter of lamb with lean bacon, and cover the 
lower side thickly ^vith grated bread. Cover tlie 
whole with paper to prevent burning, and roast it 
Take it from the fire when nearly done, and cover 
the lower side once more with grated bread ; season 
it with salt, pepper, and finely-chopped parsley; 
put it before a brisk, clear fire to brown. Pour 
over all a little eider vinegar, and serve. 

Chops, with Cucumbers. — Fry the chops of a 
light brown, and stew them for half an hour in 
good gravy ; thicken and flavor the gravy, and add 
to it some cucumbers, thickly sliced and previously 
stewed. Boil them up together, and put the cucum-

106 heats; 

butter, pepper and salt ; dredge in a little flour, 
half a pint of hot witer, and the kidneys; let thcra 
simmer twenty minutes ; stir them often ; do not 
let them fry, because it hardens them. This is a 
very nice dish for breakfast. 

Fried Sheep Kidneys. — Cut tlie kidneys open 
without quite dividing them, remove the skin, and 
put a small piece of butter in the frying-pan. 
When the butter is melted, lay in the kidneys the 
flat side downwards, and fry them for seven or 
eight minutes, turning them when they are half 
done. Serve on a piece of dry toast, season with 
pq)per and salt, and put a small piece of butter in 
each kidney; pour the gravy from the pan over 
them, and serve very hot. 

Mutton Kidneys Broiled. — Skin and split 
without parting asunder ; skewer them through the 
outer edge and keep them flat ; lay the opened sides 
first to the fire, which should be clear and brisk ; 
in ten minutes turn them ; sprinkle with salt and 
Cayenne, and when done, which will be in three 
minutes afterwards, take them from the fire, put a 
piece of butter inside them, squeeze some lemon- 
juice over them, and serve as hot as possible. 

Kidney Omelette. — Remove all the fat and 
skin from six kidneys. Cut into very fine pieces, 
season with salt and pepper, and fiy quickly in 
butter. Beat together two dozen eggs with a ^vine- 
gl»M of wine. Heat quarter of a pound of butter

in a frying-pan, pour in the e^s, and just before 
they are set, put tlie kidneys in the middle. Turn 
over the ends of the omelette, and brown on top, 
before a clear fire, and serve, with thin slices of 
lemon on the edge of the dish. 

Kidneys a la Brochette. — Remove the thin 
skin from the outside of the kidneys. Split in two, 
without entirely separating the halves. Lay flat 
with a little skewer passed through each to keep 
the halves apart. Powder with salt and pepper, 
put them on a gridiron, with the inner side of the 
kidneys next the fire. When one side is brown, 
turn them, and when the outside is done, the edges 
will turn up to form a cup; fill this with a little 
cold butter beaten with minced herbs ; squeeze in a 
little lemon-juice, and serve. 

Roast Veal. — Season a breast of veal with 
pepper and salt; skewer the sweet-bread firmly in 
its place, flour the meat and roast it slowly before a 
moderate fire for about four hours — it should be of 
a fine brown, but not dry; baste it with butter. 
When done, put the gravy in a stewpan, add a 
piec-e of butter rolled in broNvned flour, and if there 
should not be quite enough gravy, add a little more 
water, with pep|>er and salt to taste. Thie gravy 
should be brown. 

Spiced Veal. — Cut the thick portion of a loin 
of veal into small pieces, and cover it with hot-

Curry of Veal. — Cut part of a breast of veal 
in moderate sized pieces ; put it in a stewpan with 
an onion and a shalot sliced fine, a slioe of lemon, 
one ounce of butter, a little parsley and thyme, and 
a tablespoonful of curry-powder mixed with the 
same quantity of flour ; let the whole Bvrett together 
until the meat is slightly brown; add sufficient 
broth or water for the sauce ; let it boil gently till 
the veal is done ; strain the saiice through a sieve, 
pour It over the veal quite hot, and serve witJi rice 
in a separate dish. 

Fricassee op Veal. — Cut in bits lean veal, 
and parboil in salted water. Drain off the water, 
dust the veal with flour, and brown in butter; add 
sufficient of the broth for the gravy to the browned 
butter, and thicken very little with flour. Toast 
bread, lay the slices on the platter, lay on each slice 
a part of the veal, and pour the gravy o v^ the whole. 
Serve with mashed potatoes. 

Veal Cutlets with Sweet Herbs. — Chop all 
sorts of .sweet herbs, mushrooms, onions, pepper and 
salt, with a spoonful of butter ; dip the cutlets in 
this; and reduce the sauce to make it stick ; do them

Calf's Head. — Split the head in two parts^ and 
remove the brains, wash the brains in three waters, 
and lay them for an hour in odd salted water. 
Wash the head clean, and soak it in tepid water, 
until the blood is well drawn out Put it in cold 
water ; when it boils remove the scum, and simmer 
gently, until a straw can be run through it. A 
head with the skin will take three hours, if large, 
and without the skin two. Scald the brains, by 
pouring over them boiling water, take them out and 
remove the skin or film, put them in plenty of cold 
water, and simmer gently fifteen minutes. Chop 
them slightly, stew tliem in sweet butter ; add a 
teaspoon half full of lemon-juice, or not, as desired, 
and a little salt ; when done, skin the tongue, lay it 
in the centre of the dish, and the brains round it. 
Send the head to the table very hot, with drawn 
butter poured over it, and more in the tureen. 

Veal Chops, Breaded. — Take six or seven 
handsomely cut chops, season them with salt and 
pepper, and put them into melted butter. When 
sufficiently soaked put them into beaten eggs, take 
them out, and roll each separately in bread crumbs; 
make the chops as round as you can with your 
hand, and lay^them in a dish. When all are 
breaded, broil them slowly over a moderate fire, that 
the bread may not be too highly colored. ScTve

110 HAASS. 

Veal Cdtlrts, with EAGOUT.--Cut some large 
ctitlcts from the fillet^ beat them flat, and lard tliem ; 
strew over them pepper, salt, bread crumbs, and 
shred parslej; then make a ragoat of veal sweet- 
breads and ilhishrooms ; fry the cutlets of a nice 
brown in melted butter ; lay them in a dish, and 
serve the ragout very hot over them. 

Fillet op Veal, Boiled. — Choose a small, 
delicate fillet for this purpose ; prepare as for roasting, 
or stuff with an oyster forcemeat ; bind round with 
a tape; cover it with milk and water in equal 
quantities, and let it boil very gently for four hours, 
keeping it carefully skimmed. Send it to the table 
with a rich white sauce, or, if stuffed with oyster 
forcemeat, with oyster sauce ; garnish with stewed 
celery, and slices of bacon. 

Breast op Veal, with Oyster Sauce. — ^Rub 
the veal all over with salt and pepper. Cover it with 
buttered paper and then with coarse paste, baste 
frequently, to prevent the paper and paste from 
burning ; half an hour before serving, remove the 
paste and paper. Beat the white of an egg, add a 
very little loaf sugar, and wet the veal with tlie 
egg and sugar, without leaving any lumps of the 
glazing, ^nd brown it nicely. Prepare drawn 
butter with oysters, and serve the sauce in a tureen. 
This sauce can be used with roast of boiled veal, to 
good advantage, if oysters are plenty. Serve witli 
mafthod potatoes and celery.

Shouldeb of Veal. — Cut the veal into small, 
square pieces, and parboil them. Put the bones 
and trimmings into another pot, with a very little 
water, and stew them slowly, to make the gravy. 
Put the meat into a pie-dish, (deep) and season it 
with salt, Cayenne, the yellow rind of a large 
lemon grated, and some powdered mace or nutmeg. 
Add pieces of butter rolled in flour, or cold dripping 
of roast veal. Strain the gravy over the meat. 
Set in a hot oven, and bake brown. When nearly 
done, throw in a glass of wine, and serve hot. 

Hashed Calebs Head. — ^Calf's head, one ^g, 
a teaspoonful of flour, a grating of nutmeg, three 
tablespoonfuls of milk, some slices of bacon, a dozen 
forcemeat balls, pepper, salt, mace, an onion, bunch 
of herbs, one wineglassful of port wine, eight mush- 
rooms, pint of gravy, lard. Carefully cleanse the 
head of a freshly killed calf, boil it three-quarters 
of an hour, let it stand till cold, then slice it up into 
nice looking pieces. Peel the tongue and cut it into 
thin slices ; boil the brain in a cloth, chop it fine, 
and beat it up with the egg, flour, milk, and nut- 
meg. Have ready a frying-pan of boiling lard, and 
fry the mixture in fritters the size of a crown piece. 
Flavor the gravy with the whole pepper, maoe, 
cloves, herbs, onion, and Cayenne pepper. Let it 
simmer ten minutes, strain, and add the wine and 
mushrooms. Place the sliced head in this, and let 
It heat gently for ten minutes. Serve in the centre

balls, round. Strew little egg ball3 over the whole. 

Collared Calf's Head. — Boil half a calf's 
head in justi^enough water to cover it. Let it boil 
for two hours. Remove it from the broth and cut 
all the meat from the bones. Return the bones 
again to the broth and let them continue to stew. 
Put into the broth some sage leaves ; take out the 
brains and put the meat into a jar with some slices 
of ham, pepper, and salt, and the tongue. Set the 
jar in a good oven for two hours ; let it be closely 
covered. Beat up the brains with two eggs and 
pour them in. Remove the whole to a mould, and 
till it with strained broth. Dish when quite cold. 

Tea Pie op Veal. — ^The scrag, breast, or neck 
of veal will be suitable for this dish. Cut the meat 
into slices about an inch thick, fry some slices of 
salt pork in an iron pot, flour the slices of veal, put 
them in the hot fat, and brown them ; cover them 
with water, and simmer half an hour. Season with 
salt and pepper, and dredge with flour. Make a 
common paste, roll half an inch thick, and cover the 
meat. Cover the pot with a hot iron cover ; cook 
gently for an hour. 

Veal Pot-Pie. — Cut any piece of veal into small 
pieces; wash and season it with pepper and salt 
Line the sides of an iron pot with common paste. 
Put in the veal with some pieces of paste rolled thin 
and cut in squares, some pieces of butter rolled in

flour, and an tnttch water as -will cover all. Cover 
with a sheet of i)aite, cutting a hole in the centre, 
put the lid on the pot, and cook slowly for two 
hours. Place the soft crust on a dish, put the meat 
on that, and on the top lay the hard crust with the 
brown side up. Serve the gravy separately. To 
have the crust of a pot-pie brown, set the pot for a 
few moments over a clear fire, after the meat is out. 

Veal Minced. — Mince the veal as finely as pos- 
sible, separating the skin, gristle, and bones, with 
which a gravy slvould be made. Put a small quantity 
of the gravy into a stewpan, with a little lemon-peel 
grated, and a spoonful of milk or cream. Thicken 
it with a little butter and flour, mixed gradually 
with the gravy ; season it with salt and a little lemon- 
juice and Cayenne pepper. Put in the minced veal 
and let it simmer a few minutes. Serve it up with 
sippets of bread, and garnish with sliced lemon. 

Minced Veal, with Poached Egos. — Mince 
part of a fillet of veal extremely fine, put it into a 
stewpan, and pour over it a sufficient quantity of 
good hot sauce to make it of a tolerable thickness ; 
then have a stewpanful of water, with a little vine- 
gar in it, and as soon as it boils break in two eggs, 
and keep boiling quickly, but not so as to boil over. 
When they are done take them out with a cullender 
spoon, put them into another stewpan with clear 
warm water, and so on till six are done. When 
you want to serve, squeeze a little lemon-juice in tha

mince^ pour it on a hot dish^ taRe the eggs out of 
the water, neatly trim them, lay them on some veal, 
and serve. 

Minced Veal. — Take three or four pounds of the 
lean only of a fillet or loin of veal, and mince it very 
finely, adding a slice or two of cold ham, minced 
also ; add three or four small young onions, chopped 
small, a teaspoonful of sweet marjoram leaves, rubbed 
from the stalks, the yellow rind of a small lemon, 
grated, and a teaspoonful of mixed mace and nut- 
meg, powdered ; mix all well together, and dredge 
it witli a little flour. Put it into a stewpan, with 
sufficient gravy of cold roast veal to moisten it, and 
a large tablespoonful or more of fresh butter. Stir 
it well, and let it stew till thoroughly done. If the 
veal has been previously cooked a quarter of an 
hour will be sufficient. It will be much improved 
by adding a pint or more of small button mush- 
rooms, cut from the stems, and then put in whole ; 
also, by stirring in two tablcsixwnfuls of cream about 
five minutes before it is taken from the fire. 

Fried Patties. — Mince a little cold veal and 
ham, allowing one-third ham and two-thirds veal. 
Add an egg, boiled hard and chopped, and a season- 
ing of ])ounded mace, salt, pepper, and lemon-peel ; 
moisten with a little gravy and cream. Make a 
good puff-paste, roll rather thin, and cut it into round 
or square pieces; put the mince between two of 
them, pinch the edges to keep in the gravy, and fry 
a light brown. They may also be baked in patty-

pans. In that case they should be brushed ovei 
with the yelk of an egg before they are put in the 
oven. To make a variety, oysters may be substituted 
for the ham. Fry the patties about fifteen minutes. 

Veal Forcemeat. — Free a piece of lean veal 
from skin and sinews. To one pound of meat put 
one pound of suet, chopped very fine, and one pound 
of grated bread crumbs, two drachms of cliopi)ed 
parsley, one drachm each of lemon-peel, sweet herbs, 
and onions, half a drachm of powdered allspice. 
Pound all in a mortar, adding a well-beaten egg or 
two if too dry. Rub all well together and season 
with pepper and salt. 

Veal Croquettes. — Half a pound of veal, 
minced fine, quarter of a pound of stale bread crumbs. 
Put on in a saucepan and moisten with the liquor 
the veal was boiled in, and the raw yelk of two eggs 
mixed in with the bread crumbs; cook it until it 
begins to leave the sides of the pan. Two teaspoon- 
fuls of chopped parsley, one of thyme, one of chopped 
onions, half a nutmeg, quarter of a teaspoonful of 
Cayenne pepper, quarter of mace, a saltspoonful of 
salt, two ounces of butter ; mix the above into the 
bread crumbs, then add the veal after well mixing. 
Roll out each croquette into the shape of a pear, 
then dip them into the white of an egg, and sprinkle 
with bread crumbs, and fry in hot lard. Sauce 
served with them should )>e brown sauce with spicea

Veal Sausages. — Chop equal quantitleB of lean 
veal and fat bacon, a handful of sage, a I'ttle salt, 
pepper, and a few anchovies. Beat all in a mortar, 
and, when used, roll and fry it, and serve with fried 
sippets or on stewed vegetables. 

Veal Rolus. — Cut thin slices, and spread oq 
them a fine seasoning of a very few crumbs, a little 
chopped bacon or scraped ham, and a little suet and 
parsley, pepper, salt, and a small piece of pounded 
mace. This stuffing may either fill up the roll like a 
sausage, or rolled with the meat In either case tie it 
up very tight and stew it very slowly in gravy. 
Serve it when tender, after skimming it nicely. 

SuPEKiOR Veal Rolls. — Cut a few slices from 
a cold fillet of veal half an inch thick ; rub them 
over with egg ; lay a thin slice of fiit bacon over 
each piece of veal ; brush these with the egg, and 
over this spread forcemeat thinly; roll up each 
piece tiglitly, egg and bread crumb them, and fry 
them a rich brown. Serve widi mushroom sauce 
or brown gravy. Fry the roll from ten to fifteen 
minutes. 

Veal Sweet-bread. — ^Trim afine sweet- bread ; 
parboil it for five minutes, and throw it into a basin 
of cold water. Roast it plain, or beat up the yelk 
of an egg, and prepare some fine bread crumbs. 
When the «weet-bread is cold, dry it thoroughly in 
a cloth ; ruL a skewer througli it ; egg it with a 
paste-brush, powder it well with bread erumbs, and

roast it. For sauce, fried bread crumbs round it, 
and melted butter, with a little mushroom catsup 
and lemon-juice, or serve them on buttered toast, 
garnished with egg sauce or with gravy. 

Sweet-breads. — Scald them in salt and water, 
and take out the stringy parts. Then put them in 
cold water for a few moments. Dry them in a 
towel, dip in egg and crumbs, and fry brown in but- 
ter. When they are done, take them on a dish, 
pour into the frying-pan a large cup of sweet cream, 
a little pepper and salt, and a little green parsley, 
chopped fine. Dust in a very little flour, and when 
it boils up pour it over the breads, and send to the 
table hot. 

Fried Sweet-bread. — Sweet-breads should al- 
ways soak half an hour in tepid water with a pinch 
of salt in it, to make them white. Put them after- 
wards in cold water, and place over the fire to boil ; 
boil ten minutes. Cut them into slices, brush them 
with beaten egg, and cover with grated bread 
crumbs. Fry each slice till brown, in butter. Serve 
with rich gravy. 

Veal Olives. — Cut two thin steaks from a fil- 
let of veal ; beat them, and rub them over with the 
yelk of an egg ; cut them in strips four inches long. 
Over every strip lay a very thin piece of fat bacon, 
and strew each with grated bread crumbs, a little 
lemon-peel, and choj)ped parsley, and season with 
salt and Cayenne. Roll each strip up and fiisten

with a little wooden skewer. Dip each roll into 
®gg> grated bread, and chopped parsley. Put some 
clarified beef dripping into a frying-pan, let it boil; 
then throw in the rolls, and fry light brown. To 
a pint of good gravy add a dessertspoonful of lemon 
pickle, a dessertspoonful of walnut catsup, and a tea- 
spoonful of browning, Cayenne pepper and salt to 
taste, and thicken with butter rolled in flour. Place 
the fried olives on a dish, strain the gravy over 
them hot; garnish with lemon pickle and forced 
meat balls, and strew over all pickled mushrooms 
to flavor. 

Roast Leg op Pork. — Cut a slit near the 
knuckle,. and fill the space with sage and onion, 
chopped fine, and seasoned with pepper and salt, 
with or without bread crumbs. Rub sweet oil on 
the skin, to prevent it blistering and make the 
crackling crisp ; and the outer rind may be scored 
with lines, about half an inch apart. If the leg 
weigh seven or eight pounds, it will require from 
two and a half to three hours' roasting before a 
strong fire. Serve with apple sauce and potatoes ; 
which are likewise eaten with all joints of roasted 
pork. 

If the stuffing be liked mild, scald the onions 
before chopping them. If pork is not stuffed, you 
may serve it up with sage and onion sauce, as well 
as apple sauce, which should always accompany 
roast pork, whether it is stuffed or not ; and also

MEATS. 119 

with mustard. Roast leg of pork must always be 
sei'ved up with plenty of nicely boiled potatoes. 

Fresh Pork Pot-Pie. — Boil a spare-rib, after 
r^^moving all the fat, and cracking the bones, until 
tender ; remove the scum as it rises, and when ten- 
der, season with salt and pepper ; half an hour be- 
fore time for serving the dinner, thicken the gravy 
with a little flour, have ready another kettle into 
which remove all the bones and most of the gravy, 
leaving only sufficient to cover the pot half an inch 
above the rim that rests on tlie stove ; put in the 
crust; cover tight, and boil steadily twenty-five 
minutes. To prepare the crusty work into light 
dough a small bit of butter, roll it out thin, cut it 
in small square cakes, and lay them on the mould- 
ing-board until very light ; if made with brewers' 
yeast, the butter should be melted in the wetting of 
the crust, and rolled out before rising, as the first 
efFervesoence of brewers' yeast is the strongest ; 
work the dough well before making up the cakes. 

Pork Chops. — Cut the chops about half an inch 
thick ; trim them neatly, (few cooks have any idea 
how much credit they get by this ;) put a frying-pan 
on the fire, with a bit of butter ; as soon as it is 
hot, put in your chops, turning them often till 
brown all over ; they will be done enough in about 
fifteen minutes ; take one upon a plate and try it ; 
if done, season it with a little finely-minced onion, 
powdered sage, and pepper and salt A little pow-

dercd sage, etc., strewed over them, will give them 
a nice relish. 

Pork Steak, Broiled. — The tenderloin is the 
best for steak, but any lean w^hite meat is goo^L 
Broil slowly, after splitting it so as to allow it to 
cook through without drying or burning. When 
ready to turn over, dip the cooked side in a nice 
gravy of butter, pepper, and salt, which should be 
prepared on a plate, and kept hot without boiling. 
It must be well done. It requires slow broiling. 
It will take at least twenty minutes to broil a pork 
steak. 

Pork Cutlets. — Cut slices an inch thick from 
a delicate loin of pork, trim them neatly ; take off 
a part of the fat, or if the fat is not liked, remove 
the whole of it. Dredge a little pepper and salt on 
the cutlets, and broil them over a clear fire about 
twenty minutes. They may be dipped in beaten 
egg and afterwards in grated bread crumbs flavored 
with minced sage, and then broil. If fried, they 
should be well seasoned with pepper and salt, and 
dredged with flour before being put in the fat. The 
best fat is fried from bacon or salt pork. 

PoRi^ AND Apple Fritters. — Prepare a light 
batter, freshen or use cold boiled or baked pork ; 
cut it fine enough for hash, and fry it a little to 
extract some of the fiit for frying the fritters. Peel 
sour apples, and cut or chop them not quite as fine 
as the pork; mix first tlie pork and then the appliit

MEATS. 121 

in the batter, and fry them brown. Potatoes, 
pai'snips, salsify, or any vegetable desired, can be 
used in the same manner. 

English Raised Pork Pie. — Put into a stew- 
pan six ounces of lard, with a teacupful of cold 
water; let it stand by the fire till boiling, then put 
to it one pound of flour. Mix it well with a spoon 
till cool enough to raise. When you have raised 
your pies, let them stand for half an hour before 
you put in your meat; put on your cover and orna- 
ment to your fancy. To prepare the meat^ cut up 
the pork to about the size of dice, add pepper and 
salt to your taste (but take care that the pepper be 
equally distributed), add one tablespoonful of water 
to each pound of meat. One pound of flour will 
bake three good-sized pies. They require three 
hours' baking in a very moderate oven. 

Fresh Pork Pi:b. — ^Boil lean, fresh pork, and 
make the paste as for beefeteak pie; add to the pie, 
after putting in the meat, two potatoes cut fine, 
which have been before boiled ; season with i>epper, 
salt, and a dust of summer savory. If there is not 
fet enough in the pork, add butter; thicken the 
gravy with a little flour. The pie should contain 
as much gravy as possible. It is good cold or hot. 

Scrambled Pork. — Freshen nice salt pork, cut 
it in mouthfuls, and partly fry it. Just before it is 
done break into the pan with the pork from six to 
twelvQ qsgSi, br^k md vaix the .yelks with the

whites, and stir them quickly with the pork. If 
the pork is fried brown before the egg io addal, 
there may be too much fat for the egg ; if so, put 
it in a gravy-boat if needed for the table, or save it 
for shortening. Baked potatoes are excellent with 
salt meats that have a gravy of their own. 

To CtTRB Hams. — ^To each green ham of 
eighteen pounds, one dessertspoonful of saltpetre ; 
quarter of a pound of brown sugar rubbed on tho 
fleshy side of the ham, and round the hock. Cover 
the fleshy part with fine salt half an inch thick, and 
pack away in tubs ; let them remain from three to 
six weeks, according to size. Before smoking, rub 
off any salt that may remain on the ham, and cover 
well with ground black pepper, especially on the 
bone and hock. Hang up to drain for two days ; 
smoke with green wood for eight days, or until the 
rind is a light chestnut color. The pepper is a 
certain preventive of the fly. 

Baked Ham. — Soak for an hour in water, and 
wipe very dry ; cover with a thin batter, and put it 
in a deep dish, with a grate under it, to keep it up 
from the gravy. When fully done, take off tho 
skin and batter. Cool and garnish as boiled ham ; 
serve with wine sauce. 

Ham Pie. — Make a crust the same as for soda 
biscuit ; line your dish ; then put in a layer of 
potatoes sliced thin, pepper, salt, and a little butter «

IfEATEL 123 

then a layer of lean ham ; add oonsideraUe watei^ 
and you will have an excellent pie, 

HA.U Omelette. — ^Two eggs, four ounces of 
butter, half a salts}X)onful of pepper, two tablespoon- 
fuls of minced ham. Mince the ham very finely^ 
without any fat, and fry it for two minutes in a little 
butter ; then make the batter for the omelette, stir 
in the ham, and proceed as in the case of a plain 
omelette. Do not add any salt to the batter, as the 
ham is usually sufficiently salt to impart a flavor to 
the omelette. Good lean bacon, or tongue, answers 
equally well for this dish ; but they must also be 
slightly cooked previously to mixing them with the 
batter. Serve very hot and quickly, without gravy. 

Ham Toast. — Grate a sufficiency of the lean of 
cold ham. Mix some beaten yelk of egg with a 
little cream, and thicken it with the grated ham. 
Then put the mixture into a saucepan over the fire, 
and let it simmer awhile. Have ready some slices 
of bread nicely toasted (all the crust being pared 
off) and well buttered. Spread it over thickly with 
tlie ham mixture, and send it to table warm. 

Omelette op Ham, Tongue, or Sausage. — 
There are three methods of making a ham or 
tongue omelette : first, by simply cutting the meat 
into small dice, tossing it in butter, and pouring the 
well beaten and seasoned eggs ui>on it in the pan, 
and letting them remain until set, when serve ; or 
pound the meat ta a paste in a mortar, and beat it

up with the eggs, and fry in the osoal Inannei' 
Tlie third method is to beat the eggs and fry them, 
then hiy upon them the meat (which has been pre* 
viously tossed in butter), fold in the ends of the 
omelette, and serve as hot as possible. 

Sausages, No. 1. — The proper seasoning is salt,, 
pepi^er, sage, Summer-savory, or thyme ; they should 
be one-third iat, the remainder lean, finely chopped, 
and the seasonings well mixed, and proportioned 
so that one herb may not predominate over the 
others. If skhis are used, they cannot be prepared 
with too much care; but they are about as well 
made into cakes; spread the cakes on a clean white- 
wood board, and keep them in a dry cool place j 
fry them long and gently. 

Sausages No. 2 are best when quite fresh made* 
Put a bit of butter or dripping into a clean frying- 
pan ; as soon as it is melted (before it gets hot) put 
in the sausages, and shake the pan for a minute, 
and keep turning them (be careful not to break or 
prick them in so doing) ; fry them over a very slow 
fire till th6y are nicely browned ofi all sides ; when 
they are done, lay them on k hair sieve, placed be- 
fore the fire for a couple of minutes to drain the fat 
from them. The secret of fr}'ing sausages is, to let 
th'em get hot very gradually ; they then will not 
burst, if they are not stale. The common practice 
to prevent their bursting is to prick them with a 
fork ; but this lets the gravy out

Sausage Dumplings. — Make one pound of 
flour and two ounces of dripping, or chop[X'd suet, 
into a firm paste, by adding just enough water to 
enable you to knead the whole together. Divide 
this paste into twelve equal parts, roll each of these 
out sufficiently large to be able to fold up one of 
the beef sausages in it, wet the edge of the paste to 
fasten the sausage securely in it, and, as you finish 
off each sausage dumpling, drop it gently into a 
large enough saucepan, containing plenty of boiling 
water, and when the whole are finished, allow them 
to boil gently by the side of the fire for one hour, 
and then take up the dumplings with a spoon free 
from water, on to a dish, and eat them whila they 
are hot. 

Sausage Cakes. — Chop a pound of good pork 
fine; add half a teaspoonful of pepper, half a spoon- 
ful of cloves, half a spoonful of coriander seed, and 
four tablespoonfuls of cold water. Mix all well 
together, form them into small cakes, and fry in a 
hot pan. 

ScRAFPLE. — Take eight pounds of scrap pork, 
that will not do for sausage, boil it in four gallons 
of water; when tender, chop it fine, strain the 
liquor and pour it back into the pot; put in the 
meat, season it with sage, summer savory, salt and 
pepper to taste, stir in a quart of corn meal ; after 
simmering a few minutes, thicken it with buckwheat

flour very thick; it requires very little cooking 
after it is thickened, but must be stirred constantly. 
To PnEPARE Fowls for Cooking. — Professor 
Blot, in his lectures on cooking, gives the following 
directions for preparing fowls: Never wash meat 
or fowls. Wipe them dry if you choose, and if 
there is anything unacceptable it can be sliced off 
thinly. In cooking a chicken whole, no washing 
is to be done, except the gall-bladder be broken, 
when it is best to cut the chicken up and wash it 
thoroughly. Again, in cleansing chickens, never 
cut the breast ; make a slit down the back of the 
neck, and take out the crop that way. Then cut 
the neck-bone close, and after the bird is stuffed 
the skin of the neck can be turned up over the 
back, sewed down, and the crop will look full and 
round. Further, the breast-bone should be struck 
smartly with the back of a heavy knife, or witli a 
rolling-pin, to break it. This will make the chicken 
lie rounder and fuller after it is stuffed. The legs 
and wings should also be fastened with thread close 
to the side, running a long needle through the body 
for that purpose. A good stuffing for baked or 
roast chicken may be made by chopping an onion 
fine, and stirring it with two ounces of butter in a 
saucepan on the fire. It is taken off a moment, 
and bread, which has been soaked in water and the 
water squeezed out, is added, with salt, pepper, a 
little' nutmeg, and some parsley, chopped fine. 
Then one yelk of an e^^g, mixed in thoroughly on

the fire for half a minute. This stuffing is then 
inserted in the chicken. 

It is important in choosing poultry to ascertain, 
if possible, its age. A young fowl has smooth 1^ 
and combs. When old they are rough, and have 
long hairs on the breast. They should be plump- 
breasted, with fat baci^s, and have white or light 
yellow legs. 

Fowl Stewed with Onions. — Wash it clean, 
dry and truss it as for boiling ; put a little pepper 
and salt into it, rub it with butter ; butter a sauce- 
pan ; put the fowl in the pan with a pint of veal 
stock, or water, seasoned with pepper and salt. 
Turn it while stewing, and when quite tender add 
a dozen small onions, split. Stew all together for 
half an hour. A young fowl will take one hour, 
an old one three hours to stew. 

Steamed Fowls. — Fowls are better steamed 
than boiled, especially when there is no veal stock 
on hand to boil them in. When steamed, the juices, 
should be saved by placing a pan under the strainer 
to catch all the drips. Drawn butter, plain or sea- 
soned with parsley or celery, is the most common 
sauce used for boiled fowls. Liver sauce is good ; 
but when oysters can be had, oyster sauce is to b^ 
preferred above all others. 

Fowl Cutlets. — One fowl, one egg, pinch of 
pepper and salt, a tablespoonful of gravy. Cut up 
a fowl, and bone it, form -the legs, wings, breast^

and merry-thought into six catlets, flattening and 
giving them a good shape ; take the meat from the 
remainder of the fowl, and the liver, pound it in a 
mortar with pepper, salt, and a spoonful of gravy; 
brush the cutlet over with an e^, spread the force- 
meat over them, egg again, and cover with fried 
bread crumbs, and fry them a light brown color; 
serve with lemon rind and gravy in a separate dish. 

Choice Fowl Pudding. — Take a cold fowl and 
mince it, cutting it into small square pieces. Make 
a white sauce with a small piece of butter, some 
flour, and cream or milk. Put the mince into the 
white sauce, and set it aside to cool. When quite 
cold, make up into balls. Cover them with e^ 
and bread crumbs ; do this twice, to prevent them 
from bursting. At dinner-time, fry them in hot 
lard or dripping; serve them up on a serviette; 
garnish with parsley. 

To Bone Fowxs fob Fricassees, Curries, 
AND Pies. — First carve them entirely into joints, 
then remove the bones, beginning with the legs and 
wings, at the head of the largest bone ; hold this 
with the fingers, and work the knife carefully all 
round it. The remainder of the birds is too easily 
done to require any instructions. 

To EoAST A Fowl.— Having nicely dressed the 
fowl, have ready a dressing seasoned with pepper,

the skin evenly as soon as possible, cover it with 
paper if there is the least danger of its browning 
too soon, roast pretty fast, without scorching, the 
first half hour, and baste the fowl all over every 
five minutes; after this let it roast steadily, but 
rather slowly, three-quarters of an hour, when, if 
young and tender, it will be done quite through. 
Stick a fork through the breast and thighs, and if 
the fluid which follows the fork is entirely free 
from blood, it is done. If not browned, replenish 
the fire, wet the fowl over with very little yelk of 
egg, dust it lightly with flour, and let it brown 
evenly all over. Remove the skewers and strings 
before sending it to the table. 

To Bake a Fowl. — ^Prepare a fowl as for roast- 
ing ; have the oven of good but not a raging heat. 
Lay the fowl on skewers ; baste every five minutes, 
and manage the same as the roast. If young, it 
will bake in one hour. 

To Roast a Turkey. — Proceed as directed in 
roast fowls ; allow from two and a half to three 
hours for a good-sized tender turkey. The dress- 
ings of fowls can be varied by using oysters, etc. 

To Bake a Turkey. — Follow the du-ections 
for baking fowls, and allow from two to two and a 
half hours steady baking for a common-sized young 
turkey; serve with a browned gravy. All roast 
fowls should be served with dreased vegetables^

curraht, grape, or cranberry jelly, and a baked 
pudding or pie. 

Stuffing fob a Tuekey. — ^Take some bread 
crumbs and turn ow just enough hot water to soften 
them ; put in a piece of butter, not melted, the size 
of a hen's egg, and a spoonful of pulverized sage, 
a teaspoonful of ground pepper, and a teaspoonful 
of salt; there may be some of the bread crumbs 
that need to be chopped ; then mix thoroughly and 
stuff your turkey. 

Baked Turkey. — Let the turkey be picked, 
singed, and washed and wiped dry, inside and out ; 
joint only to the first joints in the legs, and cut 
some of the neck off if it is all bloody ; then cut 
one dozen small gashes in the fleshy parts of the 
turkey, on the outside and in different parts of the 
turkey, and press one whole oyster in each gash ; 
then close the skin and flesh over each oyster as 
tightly as possible ; then stuff your turkey, leaving 
a little room for the stuffing to swell. "When stuffed 
sew it up with a stout cord, rub over lightly with 
flour, sprinkle a little salt and pepper on it, put 
some water in your dripping pan, put in your tur- 
key, baste it often with its own drippings ; bake to 
a nice brown ; thicken your gravy with a little flour 
and water. Be sure and keep the bottom of the 
dripping pan covered with water, or it will burn 
the gravy and make it bitter.

little butter rolled in flour, cover them with water, 
stew them till they are veiy tender. Line the sides 
of your pie-dish with paste, put in the giblets, and 
if the gravy is not quite thick enough, add a little 
more butter rolled in flour. Let it boil once, pour 
in the gravy, put on the top crust, leaving an open- 
ing in the centre of it in the form of a square ; 
ornament this with leaves of the paste. Set the pie 
in the oven, and when the crust is done take it out. 

To Fricasseb SMAULi Chickeks.^ — Cut ofi^ the 
wings and legs of four chickens; separate the 
breasts from the backs ; divide the backs crosswise; 
cut ofi^the necks; dean the gizzards; put them with 
the livers and other parts of the chickens, after be- 
ing thorou^ly washed, into a saucepan ; add salt, 
pepper, and a little mace ; cover with water, and 
stew till tender. Take them up ; thicken half a 
pint of water with two spoonfuls of flour rubbed 
into four ounces of butter ; add a tumbler of new 
milk; boil all together a few minutes, then add 
eight spoonfuls of white wine, stirring it in care- 
fully, so a9 not to curdle ; put in the chickens, and 
shake the pan until they are sufficiently heated; 
then serve them up. 

To Broil Chickeks without Bubning. — ^Re- 
move occasionally from the fire and baste with a 
gravy prepared as follows : Simmer together one- 
half dtp of vin^ar, a piece of butter the size of

an egg, and salt and pepper to the taste. Keep it 
hot to use. 

Chicken Pot-Pie. — Clean, singe, and joint a 
pair of chickens. Pare and slice eight white pota- 
toes ; wash the slices and put with the pieces of 
chicken into a stewpan lined with pie-crust ; season 
with salt and pepper, dredge with flour, and cover 
with water. Cover with-paste, making a hole in the 
centre; cover the kettle, and either hang it over 
the fire or set it in the oven. If in the oven, turn 
occasionally to brown evenly. Two hours' cooking 
is sufficient. When done, cut the upper crust into 
moderate-sized pieces and place them on a large 
dish ; with a perforated ladle take up the |K)tato 
and chicken, put it upon the crust; cut the lower 
crust and put on the top. Serve the gravy hot in 
a gravy tureen. 

White Fricassee. — ^Boil a chicken; joint it; 
lay it in a saucepan with a piece of butter the size . 
of an egg, a tablespoonful of flour, a little mace or 
nutmeg, white pepper, and salt. Add a pint of 
cream, and let it boil up once. Serve hot on toast. 

To Fry Cold Chicken. — Cut up the chicken, 
and take off the skin, rub it with egg, cover it with 
seasoned bread crumbs and chopped parsley, ana 
fiy in Initter. Serve with brown gravy, thickened 
with flour and butter, and seasoned with Cayenne, 
mushroom catsup, and lemon pickle. Or, the 
chicken may be seasoned, and fried in plain batten

Chicken Baked in Rice. — Cut a chicken into 
joints, a£ for fricassee, season it well with pepper 
and salt, lay it in a pudding-dish lined with slices 
of ham or bacon, add a pint of veal gravy, and an 
onion finely minced ; fill up the dish witli boiled 
rice, well pressed, and piled as high as the dish 
will allow ; cover with a paste ; bake one hour, and 
serve. 

Chicken Pufes. — Mince up together the breast 
of a chicken, some lean ham, half an anchovy, a 
little parsley, some shalot, and lemon-peel, and 
season these with pepper, salt, Cayenne, and beaten 
mace. Let this be on the fire for a few minutes, in 
a little good white sauce. Cut some thinly-rolled- 
out puff-paste into squares, putting on each some 
of the mince, turn the paste over, fry them in 
boiling lard, and serve them. These puffs are 
very good cold, and they form a convenient supper 
dish. 

To Boil a GtOOSE. — After it is well dressed, 
singe it thoroughly. Have ready a dressing pre- 
pared of bread crumbs, seasoned with pepper, salt 
and butter, with the addition of two finely-chopped 
onions, a little sage, and more pepper than would 
be used for turkey. Fill the body and close it 
firmly ; put it in cold water, and boil it gently an 
hour, if tender; if not longer; serve with giblet 
sauce. The onion can be omitted if not relished.

TO COOK PARTRIDGES. 

In making partridges ready for roasting leave the 
heads on, and turn them under the left wings ; cut 
off the tops of the toes, but do not remove the legs ; 
before a proper fire, twenty minutes' roasting will 
be ample for young partridges. After Joeing shot, 
these birds should not be kept longer than from two 
days to a week. The plumage is occasionally 
allowed to remain upon the heads of the red 
partridges, in which case the heads require to be 
wrapped in paper. 

To Roast Partridges. — ^Rightly to look well 
there should be a leash (three birds) in the dish ; 
pluck, singe, draw, and truss them ; roast them for 
about twenty minutes ; baste them with butter, and 
when the gravy begins to run from them you may 
safely assume that the partridges are done; place 
them in a dish, together with bread crumbs, fried 
nicely brown and arranged in small heaps. Gravy 
should be served in a tureen apart. 

To Broil Partridges. — Split them in half; 
do not wash them, but wipe their insides with a 
cloth ; dip them into liquid butter, then roll them 
in bread crumbs; repeat this process; lay them 
inside downwards, upon a well-heated gridiron, 
turn them but once, and when done serve them 
with a piquante sauce. If you do not employ butter 
and bread crumbs, a little Cayenne and butter 
should be rubbed upon them before they are

Before serving the pie remove the lid, take out th^ 
bacon, and add sufficient rich gravy and orange 
juice. Partridge pie may also be made in a dish in 
the ordinary way. 

To Boil Pabtbidgbs.— Properiy prepare the 
birds ; put them into plenty of bailing water ; do 
them quickly for fifteen minutes; make a rich sauce 
by adding an ounee of butter ta half a pint of good 
thick cream ; stir it one way over the fire till it 
is quite hot, and pour it into the dish with the 
partridges. 

To Stew Pabtbibgss. — Cut up the bivds, after 
seeing that they are properly plucked, singed,, eto.; 
shake the Ibllowing mixture over the fire imtil it 
boils ; an onion, sliced and pulled into rings, a piece 
of butter rolled in flour, ajid a tablespoonful each

let it simmer very gently till done; decorate the 
dish with small slices of toast; put into it the 
partridge, and pour the sauce over it. 

To Fry Partridges.— .Take a brace of cold 
partridges that have been either roasted or braised ; 
cut them into quarters ; dip them into beaten and 
seasoned yelk of egg^ ; make some butter or friture 
perfectly hot in a frying-pan ; put into it tlie birds^ 
and do them over a moderately hot fire until they 
are beautifully browned. 

Quails Cured in Oil. — ^Procure a sufficient 
number of fine, plump quails. Pluck them, draw 
them, clean them thoroughly, cut them open so that 
they will lie flat, as for broiling, and rub them over 
with salt. Let them lie in the salt, turning them 
every morning, for three days. Let them dry ; and 
tlien pack them down close in a stone jar, a^vering 
each layer of quails tightly with fresh gathered vine 
leaves. Fill the jar with pure aakd oil, and 
cover it securely witli bladder, so as quite to exclude 
the air. When they are wanted, take them out 
and broil them. They make a delicious dish for 
breakfast. 

Woodcock. — ^Woodcocks should not be drawn, 
as the trail is considered a "bonne bouche;" truss 
their legs close to the body, and run an iron skewer 
through each tliigh, close to the body, and tie them 
on a small bird spit ; put them to roast at a clear 
fire; out as many slices of bread as you have bir^s,

toast or fry them a delicate brown, aad lay them 
in the dripping-pan under the birds to catch the 
trail ; baste them with butter, and froth them with 
flour ; lay tlie toast on a hot dish, and the birds on 
the toast; pour some good beef gravy into the dish, 
and s«rve. 

Snipes differ little from woodcocks, unless in 
size ; they are to be dressed in the same way, but 
require about five minutes less time to roast them. 

Wild Ducks. — ^For roasting a wild duck you 
must have a clear, brisk fire and a hot spit. It 
must be browned upon the outside without being 
sodden within. To have it well frothed and full of 
gravy is the nicety. Prepare the fire by stirring 
and raking it just before the bifi is laid down, and 
fifteen or twenty minutes will do it in the fashion- 
able way ; but if you like it a little more done allow 
it a few minutes longer; if it is too much it will 
lose its flavor. 

To Keep Game. — ^If there be any danger of 
birds not keeping, pick and draw them, wash them 
well in water, and rub them with salt. Plunge 
them singly into a large saucepan of boiling water, 
draw them up and down by the legs to let the water 
pass through them. After they have been in the 
water for five minutes hang them up to dry in a 
cold place, sprinkle them with pepper and salt well 
inside. Before dressing thepi they must be again 
washed. By this means the most delicate birds may

be ppeservedy with Uie exception of those whieli live 
by suction, as they are never drawn ; hut they may 
be kept a long time by putting lumps of chaFcoal, or 
placing a small quantity of mould in mualln bags 
in their insides. 

Venii^n Steaks. — Cut them from the neck ; 
season them with pepper and salt. When the grid- 
iron has been well heated over a bed of bright coals, 
grease the bars and lay the steaks upoD it Broil 
them well, turning them once, and taking care to 
save as much of the gravy as possible. Serve them 
up with some currant jelly laid on each steak« 

Rabbit Pie. — Cut the rabbit into joints. Take 
out the leg bones, which, wkh the head i^nd breast 
bones well stewed, will make a good gravy. Put 
the joints of the rabbit into ^ pie^dish, with half a 
pound of salt pork in rashers, or a Uttle ham or 
baoou, if preferred to the pork. Mix in a saucer a 
little flour, pepper and salt, pounded mace, and 
grated nutmeg. Sprinkle this mixture in, add half 
a pint of water, and cover with a suet, dripping, or 
butter crust, as you please. You may improve the 
pie by putting in forcemeat balls and hard-boiled 
eggs. Bake a,bout an hour and a half; pour in the 
gravy you have made before serving. 

BoHAN PcB. — ^Boil a rabbit ; out all the meat as 
thin as possible. Boil two ounces of nj^^tcaroni very

POTTED F£3H AND MEATS. 

The preservation of potted me^ts is mkinly due 
to the exclusion of the air by the vessels in which 
they are inclosed, and the layer of fiit with which 
the meat is covered. 

For home purposes we should always recommend 
butter to be employed for this purpose, and henco 
the first operation necessary in potting is the purifi- 
cation of that substance. 

Butter, as ordinarily made, contains a considera- 
ble quantity of curdy matter, derived from the cream. 
This, after a time, turns rancid, even in spite of all 
the salt that may be added ; and consequently the 
length of time that butter will keep is limited. By 
removing the curd, butter will keep a very great 
length of time without change. The only method 
by which this can be done is by clarifying. In 
some parts of Switzerland they put the butter into 
earthenware glazed vessels, these are placed in large 
saucepans of water and heated very gently until the 
contents melt, the greatest care being taken not to 
overheat the butter, and as soon as it becomes liquid 
the vessels are allowed to cool with the slightest 
agitation. In this manner all ihe impurities are got

rid of, some being lighter rise to the top, otliers, as 
tlie curd, sink to the bottom. The pure butter so 
clarified will keep sweet for a long time, and it is in 
this condition that it should always be used in pot- 
ting. If butter is clarified in a saucepan over a fire, 
the curdy matter is certain to be overheated, and 
the whole mass becomes unpleasantly flavored. 

Clarified butter is better than suet or melted fat 
to pour over the top of the potted meats, as the suet 
in cooling cracks away from the pot and admits the 
air. This evil does not generally happen when 
butter is used. Having made these preliminary 
observations we will now give some receipts for 
potting meats, premising that small pots should 
generally be used for two reasons — firstly, the cov- 
ering of butter is less likely to crack when small 
pots are used than when large ones are employed ; 
and secondly, the contents are sooner eaten when 
opened, so that there is less chance of their being 
spoiled by exposure to the air. 

Any kind of meat — as beef, tongue, ham, chicken, 
etc., — may be potted if first baked or stewed until 
tender, and the fleshy parts pounded in a mortar 
with salt, such spices as may be approved, and a 
proportion of clarified butter. It should then be 
pressed firmly into the pots, melted clarified butter 
I>oured over it, and the pot tied down when cold. 
In most cookery books a marble mortar is recom- 
mended. This is a mistake. There cannot be a 
muda worite material ufied Uft mcfrtam than noiafbliB.

Et is soft, and, what is still worse, readily absorbent 
of grease and flavors, so after having been used for 
one substance, if high flavored, cannot be safely used 
for another. A good wedgewood-ware mortar, such 
as used by chemists, is the cheapest and best that 
can be employed. 

Many potted articles require special treatment, 
the directions for which we subjoin : 

Potted Salmon. — Split a salmon down the back, 
and divide it into two pieces, removing the back- 
bone, head, and tail. "Wipe the two sides with a 
clean napkin, but do not wash them. Salt them 
slightly, and let them drain. Put the drained 
pieces into a baking pan, after having well rubbed 
them all over with a mixture of powdered cloves and 
mace and four or five bay leaves and some whole 
pepper. Cover the fish with cold clarified butter, 
and the pan with strong paper. When baked take 
the salmon out and let it drain from the gravy. 
Take ofi* the skin and put the fish into the pots. 
Sprinkle the upper surface of the potted salmon 
with a little spice, and pour clarified butter over it 
when cold ; then close the pots. 

Potted Lobsteb. — ^Boil the lobsters yourself. 
Choose hens in preference, on account of the spawn. 
When the lobsters are cold pick out all the parts 
that are eatable. Beat the flesh in a mortar, season- 
ing it with salt and a mixture of pepper, mace, and 
uiitmosgifiady poWdeii^. As you b^t and mix i^

incorporate with the paste a small quantity of clari- 
fied butter. I^ess the m«it stri^ngly into the pot- 
ting pots, and poor over it hot clarified butter. Lob- 
sters may also be potted by putting into the pots 
lumps of the meat, and pounding only the spawn, 
and filling up with clarified butter* 

Potted Rabbit. — ^Take ofi* the legs and shoul- 
ders of the rabbits, also the fleshy parts of the back. 
Cut ofi^ the leg bones at the first joint, and the 
shoulder bones at the blades, but witjiout cutting 
off the meat. Take also the livers, season these 
limbs and livers, put plenty of butter over them, 
and bake them gently; then stow them lightly mtct 
pots, covering them with clarified butter. The 
remainder of the rabbits may serve for any other 
purpose in the culinary arrangements of the day. 

Potted Pigeons. — Clean them well, bone them, 
season them in the usual manner, and lay them very 
close in a baking-pan. Cover them with butter, tie 
very thick j)aper over them, and put the pan into 
the oven. When cold put them, closely packed side 
by side, into pots that will hold three each, and 
cover them with clarified butter. 

Potted Birds.— Bake them in a pan under a 
crust, with plenty of seasoning and busier. When 
they are cold put as many in a pot as can be &nroed 
in side by side, and cover them with clarified butter. 

To Pot Veal.— Cold fillet makes the finest 
potted veal, or it may be done as Ibllows : SeasoB

MEATS. 148 

a large slice of the fillet before it is dressed with 
some mace, pepper-corns, and two or three cloves ; 
lay it close into a potting-pan that will just hold it, 
fill it up with water, and bake it three hours. 
Then pouqd it quite small in a mortar, and salt to 
taste ; put a little gravy that was baked to it in 
|K>unding, if to be eaten soon, otherwise only a little 
butter just melted ; when done, cover it over with 
butter. 

Potted Calves' Feet. — Boil the feet for five 
hours; flavor half a pint of the jelley in which they 
are boiled with nutmeg, garlic, and pounded ham, 
and let them simmer together for a few minutes; 
cut up the feet into small pieces and season them ; 
dip a mould into cold water, and put in the meat, 
mixed with o, little grated lemon-peel and minced 
parsley. Some persons add beet-root, baked or 
boiled, cut in slices and mixed with the meat, 
when this is arranged in the mould, fill up with the 
flavored jelley. Turn out when quite cold. The 
remainder of the jelly in which the feet were boiled 
can be used as a sweet jelly. 

Potted Veal and Bacon. — ^Cut equal quanti- 
ties of veal and bacon into thin slices. Rub together 
some dried sweet-basil or summer-savory, very fine; 
lay in a stewpan a layer of bacon and a layer of 
veal, and on these sprinkle the powdered herbs, a 
little grated horseradish, pepper and salt. Put 
layers in the same order, seasoned, till all the meat

is in the pan. Squeeze over all the juice of a lemon, 
and grate on it the yellow rind. Cover very tightly 
and bake for three hours in a moderate oven, then 
take out and drain off all the gravy. Shake over 
the meat a little catsup, press under heavy weights 
for three hours, and put away in a tightly covered 
pot.

CHAPTER V. 

VEGETABLES AND SALADS. 
VEGETABLES, 

VegetaiJLes should be carefully cleaned from 
Insects and nicely washed. Boil them in plenty of 
water, and drain them the moment they are done 
enough. If over-boiled they will lose their beauiy 
and crispness. Bad cooks sometimes dress them 
with meat, which is wrong, except carrots or cabbage 
with boiling beef. 

In order to boil vegetables of a good green color, 
take care that the water boils when they are put in. 
Make them boil very fast. Do not cover, but 
watch them, and if the water has not slackened 
you may be sure they are done wh^n they begin to 
sink. Then take them out immediately, or the 
color will change. Hard water, especially if chaly- 
beate, spoils the color of such vegetables as should 
be green. To boil them green in hard water, put 
a teaspoonful of carbonate of soda or potash into 
the water when it boils, before the v^tables are 
put in. 

To Boil Potatoes. — ^Pare or merely wash them, 
a^ preferred, and put them in a covered saucepan 

145

146 VEGETABLES AKD SALADS. 

of cold water, with a teaspoonful of salt; boil them 
till they are done (which can be ascertained by 
running a fork into them) and begin to break a 
little; then. pour the water from them, and hold the 
saucepan with the lid off, over the fire for two or 
three minutes, shaking well at the end of the time; 
put the lid loosely on so as to allow the steam to 
escape, and sprinkle a very little salt over them ; 
let them stand till wanted (the sooner^the better), 
but they may remain in this way, if necessary, half 
an hour or more. Time, twenty to thirty minutes, 
or longer if very large. 

To Broil Potatoes. — ^Parboil, then slice and 
broil them. Or, parboil, and then set them whole 
on the gridiron over a very slow fire, and when 
thoroughly done send them up with their skins 
on. This last way is practised in many Irish 
families. 

Potato CHiPS.-^Wash and peel some potatoes, 
then pare them, ribbon-like, into long lengths ; put 
them into cold water to remove the strong potato 
flavor; drain them, and throw them into a pan 
with a little butter, and fry them a light brown. 
Take them out of the pan, and place them close to 
the fire on a sieve, lined with clean writing-paper, to 
dry, before they are served up. A little salt may 
be sprinkled over them. 

Steamed Potatoes. — Either peel them or not, 
according to their quality, but any rate wash them 



Digitized by VjOOQ IC 



VEGETABLES AfiJD SALADS. 147 

thoroughly ; put them into a steamer^ cover them 
down closely, and place them over a saucepan of 
boiling water. Endeavor not to lift the lid until 
you have reason to suppose the potatoes are done. 
Unless of a very small size, potatoes usually require 
forty minutes or an hour's steaming. 

Baked Potatoes. — Potatoes are either baked in 
their jackets or peeled ; in either case they should 
not be exposed to a fierce heat, which is wasteful, 
inasmuch as thereby a great deal of the vegetable 
is scorched and rendered uneatable. They should 
be frequently turned while being baked, and kept 
from touching each other in the oven or dish. 
When done in their skins be particular to wash and 
brush them before baking them. If convenient, 
they may be baked in wood-ashes, or in a Dutch 
oven in front of the -fire ; serve them in damask 
napkin. When pared they should be baked in a 
dish, and fat of some kind added to prevent their 
outsides from becoming burnt ; they are ordinarily 
baked thus as an accessory to baked meat. 

PoMMES BE Tebre A LA Danoies. — ^Peel six good 
large mealy potatoes, cut them into rather thin slices, 
and throw them into a saucepan of boiling water, 
do them quickly until they are tender enough to 
mash ; strain off the water and mash them smooth 
with a spoon, add some fresh butter or oil, salt^ 
pepper, chopped parsley, and grated nutmeg, 
together with two new-laid eggs. Stir all well,

148 VEGEIABLES AND SALADS. 

heat some very good butter or salad oil in a fiying* 
pan, place in it spoonfuls of the potato, turn them 
as they become brown, drain them from fat, and 
serve very hot. When preferred, spoonfuls may be 
arranged upon a buttered dish and baked. 

Potato Surprise. — Take some good-sized cold, 
boiled potatoes, cut a piece from the end of each, 
and with a round-topped knife remove a good deal 
of the inside of the potatoes; fill them with oysters, 
bearded, chopped, peppered, and mixed with raw 
egg ; replace the tops upon the potatoes, moistening 
the edges with raw egg to make them adhere 
together, and place the potatoes in a slack oven, 
while you prepare a batter, into which dip them, 
and afterwards fry them in lard ; when very nicely 
browned serve hot. Some pickled sauce may take 
the place of the oysters, if more convenient, or a 
few bread crumbs soaked in beaten egg. 

MiROTON OF Potatoes. — Peel and nicely steam 
eight good mealy potatoes ; when done, mash them 
and season them with pepper; chop up one medium- 
sized onion and the yelks of two hard-boiled eggs, 
try them in plenty of oil or butter ; when the onion 
is quite tender drain it and the eggs from all fat,

Potatoes Mashed and Fried. — What are 
called mashed potatoes should, to be properly made^ 
be passed through the hair sieve, and then stirred 
up in a saucepan with milk, butter, and salt ; by 
this process you avoid coming upon pieces of hard 
potato. 

Another simpler mode is to pass the potatoes 
through the sieve, and, before vthey have time to 
cool, put them into a vegetable dish, with a lump of 
butter under them, keeping them hot till the time 
of serving. 

With some dishes fried potatoes are de riguear. 
To fry them well you must attend to the following 
points : Plenty of fiit. Wait till the fat is very hot 
before you throw them in. Let them be thoroughly 
dry, for, if at all damp, they will never be crisp. 
When they have got a fine golden tinge, take them 
out and lay them on a piece of blotting paper 
before the fire, giving them a good sprinkling 
of salt. Do not attempt to fry boiled potatoes ; 
they must be raw, and you can cut them either in 
dices the thickness of a shilling, or in pieces about 
the size of a French Bean and the length of the 
potato. 

Boiled potatoes can be warmed up by frying, 
and one very good way is to fry some shalots or 
onions, and, when they begin to take color, throw 
in the potatoes, any how, and keep turning them 
until warm. 

Cold mashed potatoes make excellent little side

dishes, the simplest of which is this : Stir an egg 
or two with your potatoes ; add a few finely-pow- 
dered spices, pepper and salt to taste, and some 
minced parsley; mix well, and roll the mixture 
into balls, or any shape you like ; cover with fine 
bread crumbs, fry a nice golden color, and serve 
garnished with fried parsley. This dish can be 
varied ad injmitur% by either inserting in the mid- 
dle of each ball, or incorporating with the mixture, 
any of the following : The flesh of fowls or game, 
any kind of fish, lobsters, crabs, etc., all finely 
minced. If you have some very rich stock, moisten 
the minced meat or fish with it, and your dish will 
be improved ; only, in that case, you must put a 
small portion of the mixture in each ball, and not 
mix it up with the potatoes. The above combina- 
tions can be erected into a more imposing dish by 
placing the minced fish or meat in a pie-dish, and 
covering over with potatoes, then baking until the 
top is of the desired color ; iii this case, however, a 
regular ragout should be made for the animal part 
of the dish, and the potatoes only play second 
fiddle. 

A favorite way of dressing potatoes is this : Cut 
them up into quarters ; rub a saucepan with a piece 
of garlic, put into it a goodly piece of butter, and 
when it is melted throw in your potatoes ; add a 
very little water, pepper and salt, and a small 
quantity of grated nutmeg ; let the whole simmer 
till done, and, before serving, add some minced

parsley and a little lemon-juice. Cooked in tliis 
way they can be eaten as a separate dish. 

Boiled potatoes cut up into quarters, and with a 
white sauce, with minced parsley put over them, 
make a very nice dish. 

A delicious way of eating new potatoes is to put 
them into a saucepan with plenty of butter; toss 
them about till done, sprinkling with salt, and 
serving very hot. 

With potatoes a most excellent good, sweet dish 
can be made. It is made thus: Boil and pass 
through a hair sieve three or four potatoes ; stir to 
them powdered sugar and the yelks of two eggs ; 
add a few drops of essence of vanilla, or any other 
essence ; beat up the whites of the two eggs into a 
froth, mix quickly and thoroughly with the pud- 
ding, pour into a shape (previously buttered and 
bread-crumbed) and bake in a quick oven for 
twenty minutes or less. This will be found a very 
effective dish. The only difficulty about it is the 
timing of the cooking thereof, as it requires to be 
taken up to table as soon as it is done, and the 
cook must know her company well to bjB able to 
judge how long they will take over the previous 
dishes. . The preparing of this dish is very good 
practice for making aoufflis; and, iii fact, if less 
potatoes are used and more eggs, you produce, with- 
out knowing it, a sovjffi^ of pommes de terre, as it is 
called.

have some thin slices of fat bacon large enough to 
envelop a potato ; wrap one in each rasher, arrange 
them in a small baking dish, put them into a mode- 
rately hot oven, and bake them until the potatoes 
are done ; rasp a little toast upon them, and serve 
them directly. 

Stewed Potatoes. — Cut into slices four cold 
potatoes that have either been boiled or steamed ; 
season them, dredge them with flour, and put them 
into a stewpan with some fresh butter or olive oil ; 
fry them slightly on both sides for five minutes, 
drain ofi^ the fat, pour upon them half a pint of 
good gravy nicely flavored, and let them stew by 
the side of the fire for twenty minutes. Serve to- 
gether with the sauce in which they were stewed. 

Browned Potatoes.— Steam or boil some rather 
small-sized potatoes, peel them, and throw them 
into a stewpan of boiling butter ; shake them occa- 
sionally, and when done and well browned, serve 
them upon a thin slice of toast which has been 
dipped into either essence of anchovy, or catsup. 

Potato Fritters. — ^Take seventeen large-sized

New Potatoes — To Boil. — Procure them of 
equal size, and if very young, wash them only ; if 
older, rub off the skins with a scrubbing-brush or 
coarse cloth. Put them into boiling wat^ till ten- 
der, and sprinkle a little salt over them, and put 
a lump of butter in ; shake up and serve. Time, 
fifteen to twenty minutes. 

Potato Salad is made with vinegar in the fol- 
lowing manner, viz. : Boil your potatoes, (select the 
smallest,) and, as soon as they are done, peel them 
as quick as you can ; cut them in small slices, and 
after seasoning them with salt and pepper, pour 
over them (while hot) five or six tablespoonfuls of 
vinegar to about one quart of potatoes, and turn 
them thoroughly. Cut a large onion very fine and 
put it in, still turning. Half an hour after, add 
three or four tablespoonfuls oi sweet oil, and after 
turning again, serve. 

Potato Patties. — ^Butter some small patty-pans ; 
strew bread crumbs over the insides and fill them 
with some moely-mashed potatoes, flavored with 
either mushroom catsup, grated lempn*peel, or sav-

Potatoes in Meat, Puddings, and PiEs.r- 
The introduction of a potato or two into family pud- 
dings is a generally acknowledged improvement, 
inasmuch as the farinaceous nature of the potato 
causes it to absorb fet, and thereby act as a correc- 
tive to the over richness of most meat pies and pud- 
dings. Potatoes are especially of advantage with 
beef or mutton, one or two to an ordinary sized 
pasty being sufficient. 

Roasted Potatoes. — Wash some good sized 
potatoes and boil them for ten minutes. Take them 
up and peel them, well butter them outside, sprinkle 
some salt and pepper upon them, and dredge them 
with a little flour ; arrange them in an oven and 
roast them before the fire, turning them as they 
require it. When thoroughly brown serve in a hot 
dish. 

Jury Pie. — Steam ot boil some mealy potatoes, 
mash them together with some butter or cream, 
season them, and place a layer at the bottom, of the 
pie-dish, upon this place a layer of finely chopped 
cold meat or fi^ of any kind, well seasoned, then 
add another layer of potatoes, and continue alternat- 
ing these with more chopped meat until the dish be

make a nice presentable little dish, A sprinkling 
of chopped pickles may be added if handy, and when 
fish is employed it eats better if first beaten up with 
raw egg. Some dressed spinach, tomatoes, aspara- 
gus tops, etc., may be made use of in place of the 
meat, if convenient, but the potatoes should pre- 
dominate three-fourths more than the other ingre-

Potato CROQUETrES, a Sweet Dish. — ^Take

and dipping them in white of ^g whipped to a snow. 
Fry them in plenty of lard or fresh butter. 

Potato Pone. — ^This is a fiivorite dish in the 
West India Islands. Wash, peel, and grate two

Savory Potato Cakes. — Quarter of a pound 
of grated ham, one pound of mashed potatoes, and 
a little suet, mixed with the yelks of two eggs, pep- 
per, salt, and nutmeg. Boll it into little balls or 
cakes, and fry it a light brown. Sweet herbs may 
be used in the place of ham. Plain potato cakes 
are made with potatoes and eggs only. 

CAULIFLOWER. 

One of the prettiest dishes of vegetables we kpow 
consists of a cauliflower of ivory whiteness resting 
upon a bed of well made tomato sauce. To insure 
the immaculate appearance of the cauliflower, a 
moderate quantity of flour should be put in the 
water it is boiled in, and the cauliflower should only 
be put in when the water is boiling fast. When 
two or more cauliflowers are used, they should bo 
moulded into one to serve them. To do this, when 
they are boiled, cut off the stalk, and dispose the 
pieces of cauliflower head downwards in a basin ; press 
them gently together, turn them out dexterously on 
a dish, and two or three small cauliflowers will by

this means present the appearance of one large one 
Care must be taken to have the basin quite hot and 
to operate quickly. This cannot very well be done 
with the small purple cauliflower or brocoli ; but all 
the formulas given for cauliflowers proper may be 
applied to brocoli likewise. 

The sauce should be put into the dish and the 
cauliflowers over it ; but if the moulding process has 
not been successful, or if the cauliflowers are not 
very nice looking ones, then pour the sauce over 
them, so as to hide their deformity. 

The very best way, however, to treat cauliflowers 
is au graUriy and this has the advantage that it may 
be applied to the remains of the cauliflowers served 
at the dinner of the day before. This is the simplest 
form of it : Dispose the pieces of cauliflowers on a 
dish, pour a good supply of liquified butter over 
them, and plenty of grated cheese, with a judicious 
admixture of powdered white pepper, salt, and nut- 
meg. Put the dish into the oven for a few minutes, 
or brown with a red-hot salamander, and serve. 

Here are other modes of proceeding: Rub the 
dish very slightly with garlic, mould your cauli- 
flowers in a basin, and pour into them, before turn- 
ing them out, some melted butter, into which you 
have dissolved a good allowance of cheese; turn 
them out on the dish, strew plentifully Tvdth grated 
cheese, a few bread crumbs, pepper, and salt, pour- 
ing the remainder of the sauce over. Brown and 
serve.

VEGETABLEB AND SALADS. 169 

Instead of moulding the cauliflowers, dip eaeh 
piece in the sauce, and dispose them flat on the 
dish, filling up the interstices with bread erumbs 
and cheese in equal parts ; pepper and salt accord- 
ing to taste ; brown and serve. 

The great thing to be avoided is not to make these 
preparations too dry, and yet there should not be 
over much butter. The browning must be carefiilly 
done, so as to produce a surface of a uniform golden 
color — not in patches, some burnt black, and others 
not browned at all, as is too often the case in the 
preparations of the careless and hasty operators wlio 
preside in kitchens. 

To such people as may object to cheese, I can 
recommend the following receipt, which has great 
merit of its own : Dispose your pieces of boiled cau- 
liflower upon a dish well rubbed with garlic, over 
them strew a mixture of bread crumbs and ancho- 
vies, capers, and olives, mixed fine pepper, and salt ; 
over all pour a judicious quantity of fine salad oil. 
Bake for about ten minutes, and serve. 

Celery may be dressed according to the above 
formulas also ; but we prefer treating the latter in 
the same way as asparagus, which it emulates in 
delicacy of flavor — i. «., by plain boiling in salt and 
water, and serving with some simple sauce.

Cauliflower Omelette. — After boiling a firm 
head of cauliflower allow it to grow cold, chop it very 
fine, mix it with sufficient well beaten egg to make 
a very thick batter. Fry brown in fresh butter, and 
serve liot. 

Cauliflower in Milk. — Choose those that are 
close and white, cut ofl* the green leaves, and look 
carefully that there are no caterpillars about the 
stalk ; soak an hour in cold water, with a handful 
of salt in it ; then boil them in milk and water, and 
take care to skim the saucepan, that not the least 
foulness may fall on the flower. It must be served 
very white and rather crimp. 

Fried Cauliploweb. — Having laid a fine 
cauliflower in cold water for an hour, put it into a 
pot of boiling water that has been slightly salted 
(hiilk and water will be still better,) and boil it 
twenty-five minutes, or till the large stalk is per- 
fectly tender. Then divide it equally into small 
tufts, and spread it on a dish to cool. Prepare a 
sufficient quantity of batter made in the proportion 
of a tablespoonful of flour, and two tablespoon fula 
of milk to each egg. Beat the eggs very light; 
then stir into them the flour and milk alternately; 
a spoonful of flour, and one of milk and eggs;

Corn Balls. — Grate five ears of partly dried 
corn, and powder it in a mortar. Roll the powder 
into small balls and boil them twenty minutes. 
Take them out of the water; cool them; mash them 
with some crushed white sugar and two eggs. 
Form again in balls and fry in boiling lard and 
butter. Sprinkle them with fahely powdered sugar^ 
and serve hot. 

Corn Oysters. — Grate the com. To every 
pint, take three well beaten eggs, and sufficient 
flour to bind the mixture together. Season with 
salt, form in the shape of oysters, and fry brown in 
butter and lard. 

Corn in Cans. — ^Dissolve one ounce and a 
quarter of tartaric acid in half a pint of water. 
Cut the corn from the cob, and add sufficient water 
to cook it proj^erly. When cooked, add two table- 
S])oonfuls of the acid solution to every quart of corn. 
Can it immediately; seal securely, and put it away 
in a cool, but not damp place. When wanted for 
use, stir half a teaspoonful of soda through two 
quarts of corn, and let it stand three or four hours 
before cooking. This will remove all the acid taste, 
and render the corn f^ fresh as when cooked in the 
summer.

Stir in at the last some beaten yelk of egg, and in 
three minutes remove it from the fire. Take up 
(he iK)rridge, and send it to table hot, and stir 
some fresh butter into it. You may add sugar and 
nutmeg. 

Succotash. — If old beans are used, they must 
be soaked over night, and parboiled in two waters 
Iwfbre putting in the pork. The com should be 
added to the beans and pork about fifteen minutes 
before the hour for serving the dinner. It is well to 
boil the cobs with the beans and pork in the last 
water. Remove them before adding the com. For 
using beans not ftilly ripe, one change of water is 
sufficient ; the pork can be parboiled at the same 
time. Beans for succotash should remain whole; 
care must be taken that they boil gently, so as not 
to break them. Considerable water is generally 
used in boiling the beans, that no more need be 
added when the corn is put in ; most persons like 
considerable soup in this dish. Families can be 
governed by taste in this. Dish the com and 
beans in a deep dish with the froth, and season 
with butter and a very little salt: use no pep- 
per; if any person desires it, it is easily added.

grain, it is stated, will come out of the boiler as dry 
and distinct as if just taken from the hull. More 
water may be poured into the pan if necessary, but 
only sufficient to keep up the steam till the rice is 
cooked. The pan must not be heated so hot as to 
cause the steam to blow off the lid. 

Cakolina Rice. — Pick the rice carefully, and 
wash it through two or three cold waters till it is 
quite clean. Then (having drained off all the water 
through a colander) put the rice into a pot of boil- 
ing water, with a very little salt, allowing as much 
as a quart of water to half a pint of rice ; boil it 
twenty minutes or more. Then pour off the water, 
draining the rice as dry as possible. Lastly, set it 
on hot coals with the lid off, that tlie steam may 
not condense upon it and render the rice watery. 
Keep it dry thus for a quarter of an hour. Put it 
into a deep dish, and loosen and toss it up from the 
bottom with two forks, one in each hand, so that 
the grains may appear to stand alone. 

Bice and Milk. — ^To every quart of good milk

well covered with lanl, and serve with lemon or 
orange-juice and sugar, or with sweet or wine sauoa. 

Parsnip Fritters, No. 2. — ^Boil the parsnips in 
salteil water, so as to flavor them through. Make 
a light batter, cut them round, and dip them in the 
batter. Have ready hot lard, take them up with a 
a tablespoon, and drop them in while the lard is

when browned on both sides take them out. Let 
them drain, and set them in the oven to keep hot. 
Serve with broiled, fried, or roast meats or fowls. 

Fricassee of Parsnips. — ^Boil in milk till they

with all meats. With fowls they are nicest mashed. 
Carrots^ parsnips, tarnips, greens, and cabbage are 
eaten with boiled meat ; and beets, peas, and beans 
are appropriate to either boiled or roasted meat. 
Mashed turnip is good with roasted pork. To- 
matoes are good with every kind of meat, but 
especially so with roast; apple sauce with roast 
pork ; cranberry sauce with beef, fowls, veal, and 
ham. Currant jelly is used by many persons with 
roast mutton. Pickles arie good with all roast meats, 
and capers or nasturtiums with boiled lamb or mut- 
ton. Horseradish and lemons are excellent with 
veal. 

Carkots. — ^Let them be well washed and brushed, 
not scraped. An hour is enough for young spring 
carrots. Grown carrots must be cut in half, and 
will take from an hour and a half to two hours and 
a half. When done rub oflF the peels with a clean, 
coarse cloth, and slice them in two or four, according 
to their size.. The be^ way to try if they are done 
enough is to pierce them with a fork. 

Carrot Fritters. — ^These very nice fritters are 
simply made, and we can recommend them as being 
an agreeable variety for a side dish at a small party.

juice of an orauge, and strewed them over with 
iinelj sifted sugar. 

Parsley and Butter. — Wash and tie up a 
bunch of parsley. Put it in boiling water, and let 
it boil for five minutes. Drain it, cut off the stalks, 
and chop the leaves very fine. Put it into the 
melted butter, which may be made by smoothly 
mixing a tablespoonful of flour with half a pint of 
water and two ounces of butter. Stir all one way ; 
let it boil about two minutes. 

Fried Artichokes. — Cut the artichokes into six 
or eight pieces, according to their size, remove the 
choke and the large leaves which will not become 
tender, and trim off the tops of the remainder of the 
leaves with a pair of scissors. Wash them in sev- 
eral waters, drain them, and dip them in a batter 
made with flour, a little cream, and the yelk of an 
egg. Let the artichokes be well covered with the 
batter, and fry them in lard. Sprinkle a little salt 
over them, and serve them on a bed of parsley fried 
in the lard which remains in the pan. 

Summer Squashes. — When these vegetables are 
fresh, the rind will be crisp when cut by the nail. 
If very young and tender they may be boiled whole, 
if not pare them. Extract the seeds and strings,

then press them thi^ugh a colander with a skim- 
mer. Mix them with butter to your taste, and a 
little salt if necessary. 

Stewed Spinach. — Pick the spinach very clean, 
and wash thoroughly through several waters. Drain 
it and put it in a saucepan with only the water that 
clings to it. Add salt and pepper and stew for 
twenty minutes, or till quite tender. Turn it often 
while stewing and press it down with a wooden 
spoon or ladle. When done, drain and press as 
dry as possible; chop it up fine; set it again over 
the fire ; add to it some pieces of butter rolled in 
flour, and the beaten yelks of two eggs. Simmer 
five minutes, and take it off without allowing it to 
boil. Serve upon thin slices of well-buttered toast 
cut in small squares. 

Spinach to Boil. — Spinach requires a great 
deal of water to free it ft*om the grit in which it is 
covered from its low growth. The stalks should 
be broken off, and the spinach washed well with 
the hand. Put it into a saucepan with a little salt. 
A very large quantity of uncooked spinach is needed 
to make a dbh, as it wastes considerably in cooking. 
Boil it for about twelve minutes, pressing it down 
when quite tender. Drain it thoroughly and squeeze 
out the water. Chop it quite small. Put it into a

Boiled Onions. — Take the outside skin from 
white onions as uniform in size as possible, lay them 
in cold salt and water one hour, boil them in milk 
and water until thoroughly tender ; lay them in a 
deep dish, and pour over them melted butter. 

Buttered Onions. — ^Peel enough small onions 
to fill a vegetable dish ; throw them into a stewpan 
of boiling water; add a little salt and a piece of 
fresh butter. Stew for five minutes. Drain them; 
put them into a saucepan with a large piece of 
butter, some pepper, nutmeg and salt. Toss them 
about over a clear fire until they begin to brown ; 
add a tablespoonful of gravy, and a dessertspoonful 
of chopped herbs. Stew gently for fifteen minutes, 
and serve upon cream toast. 

Roasted Onions. — These should be cooked in 
their skins ; but before putting them into the oven, 
brush ofi^ all grittiness. Place in a moderate oven, 
cooking gradually until nearly done, then quicken 
the oven and brown. Serve with plenty of fresh 
butter. 

Flaked Onions. — ^Boil two good-sized Spanish 
onions in plain water, put aside until cold. Flake 
on two forks ; season to taste. Make some butter

them ; put them immediately into a vegetable dish, 
and pour over them a good caper sauce made quit^ 
hot This is the pro|)er way of serving onions with 
a dish of boiled mutton. 

Stewed Celery. — Wash the celery very clean, 
and cut it to the length that it will Ke evenly in a 
saucepan. Cover it with water, but do not use 
more than nectissary. Salt the water rather freely. 
Let the celery boil from a quarter of an hour to 
twenty-five minutes, according to the size of the 
heads. Drain it, and serve it on toast as you 
would asparagus. A tureen of melted butter should 
be served with it, or some persons prefer white 
sauc^. 

Fried Celery. — Is prepared as follows: Cut 
off the green tops of six or eight heads of celery, 
and remove the outside stalks. Wash them well 
and pare the roots clean. Have ready half a pint 
of white wine, the yelks of three eggs finely beaten, 
and a little salt and nutmeg, and mix them all well 
together with some flour into a batter. Dip every 
head into this batter, and fry them in butter. 
Wlien sufficiently done, lay them in a dish and 
pour melted butter over them.

drops will flavor a pint of soup or broth, equal to a 
head of celery. 

Vegetable Oyster Cakes. — Select good, 
large-sized oyster plant roots, grate them, and add 
milk and flour sufficient to make a stiff batter, 
about a gill of grated oyster plant, two eggs, one 
pint of milk, and flour to make the batter, and salt. 
Drop it by tablespoonfuls into hot lard. Bake till 
brown. 

Egg Plant. — Select long purple if possible ; the 
next best is the round kind with prickles on the 
stem. Peel and slice them, spread salt on each 
separate piece, and lay them in a colander to diuin ; 
let them He one hour, parboil, and fiy them, until 
thoroughly cooked, in pork fat or butter; egg 
plants, unless well cooked, are insipid, and even 
disgusting; they must be cooked through and 
browned. 

Boiled Beets. — Beets must not be cut before 
boiling, as the juice will escape and the sweetness 
be destroyed. Select small-sized, smooth roots, wash 
them nicely, and boil in clear water until tender. 
When sufficiently cooked, skim them into a pan of 
cold water, and slip off the skin. Cut them in 
thin slices, and while hot, season with butter, salt, 
pepper and vinegar, and serve. If preferred cold, 
slice lengthwise and lay in strong cold vinegar.

let it boil^and skim it; then put in your asparagus, 
prepared thus : Scrape all the stalks till they are 
perfectly clean; throw them into a pan of cold 
water as you scrape them ; when they are all done, 
tie them up in little bundles, of about a quarter of 
a hundred each ; cut off the stalks at the bottom 
that they may be all of a length, leaving only just 
enough to serve as a handle for the green part; 
when they are tender at the stalk, which wilJ be 
from twenty to thirty minutes, they are done 
enough. Great care must be taken to watch the 
exact time of their becoming tender ; take them up 
just at that instant, and they will have their true 
flavor and color ; a minute or two more boiling de- 
stroys both. While the asparagus is boiling, toast 
some bread about half an inch thick ; brown it 
delicately on both sides; dip it lightly in the liquor 
the asparagus was boiled in, and lay it in the mid- 
dle of a dish ; melt some butter, then lay in the 
asparagus upon the toast, which must project be- 
yond the asparagus, that the company may see there 
is a toast. Pour no butter over them, but send some 
up in a deep dish^ 

Stewed Asparagus. — ^Use it as soon as possible 
a»fter cutting ; there are several ways of cooking 
this, each of which is good. Discard all not brittle 
enough to break easily, tie it in small bunches, and 
boil it in very little water, slightly salted, until 
tender ; take off the strings, put it in a covered 
dish, add butter to the water sufficient to make a

pour the gravy over tlie a8j>aragus'; be careful to 
hiy the heads all one way. 

Asparagus Soup. — ^Cnt the asparagus in pieces 
a half inch long, boil in water with a little salt, 
and add ridi sweet cream to thicken the soup. 

Asparagus Toast. — Tie the stalks in small 
bunches, boil them in very little salted water until 
t(»n(ler ; toast as many slices of bread as there are 
bunches of asparagus, butter them while hot, lay a 
bunch on each slice of toast, add a little butter to 
the water, and pour it over the whole. 

Asparagus Omelette. — Boil some tender, 
freshly-cut asparagus in a very little water, slightly 
salted, or steam till tender. Chop up very fine; 
beat with it the yelks of six and the whites of three 
eggs, (which must be beaten sei)arately till light;) 
add two tablespoonfuls of sweet cream. Fry in 
butter, and serve hot. 

Turnips a la Poulette. — Cut the turnips into 
dice in a saucepan ; boil till tender, and drain. 
Put in the saucepan a piece of butter rolled in 
flour, and stir gently over the fii'e; add a gill of 
milk, stir sig:iin; put in the turnips, ix'pjwr, and 
salt. Stew five minutes, and serve.

lay them on a sieve till the water is thoroughly * 
drained from them. Send them up whole ; do not 
slice them. 

Turnip Tore. — ^Boil thoroughly, with plenty of 
water, salt, and soda in due proportions ; drain and 
pass through a hair sieve. Melt a piece of butter, 
to which add a little fkmr and the pulp of your 
turnip tops ; stir on the fire a few minutes, adding 
a little milk or cream^ and a little broth or stock, 
with pepper or grated nutmeg to taste. When a 
nice consistency, not too thick, dress on a dish as 
you would spinach, and serve with fried sippets of 
bread around it. If properly cooked, this dish has 
a better color than spinach, and a very pleasant, 
nutty, bitter taste. 

To Boiii Peas. — ^They should be young and of 
a good sort Must not be over-done, nor in much 
water. Boil some mint with them, and chop it to 
garnish them, and stir a piece of butter in with 
them. If either too young or too old, a little 
sugar boiled with them is an improvement. 

Green Peas. — ^Put into a stewpan a quart of 
peas, one onion, two ounces of butter, a sprig of 
mint, a teaspoonful of white sugar, and two table- 
spoonfuls of gravy ; stew till soft, when take out 
the onion and mint, and thicken with flour and 
butter. A lettuce is sometimes stewed with them.

Stewed Mushrooms. — One pint of mushroom 
buttons, three ounces of fresh butter, white pepper 
and salt to taste, lemon-juice, one teaspoonful of 
flour, cream or milk, quarter of a teaspoonful of 
grated nutmeg. Cut off the ends of the stalks, and 
pare neatly a pint of mushroom buttons ; put ihcm 
into a basin of water, with a little lemon-juice, as 
they are done. When all are prepared, take them 
from the water with the hands, to avoid the sedi- 
ment, and put them into a stewpan with the fresh 
butter, white pepper, salt, and the juice of half a 
lemon ; cover the pan closely, and let the mush- 
rooms stew gently from twenty to twenty-five 
minutes; then thicken the butter with the above 
proportion of flour, add gradually suflicient cream, 
or cream and milk, to make the sauce of a proper 
consistency^ and put in the grated nutmeg. If the 
mushrooms are not perfectly tender, stew them for 
five minutes longer, remove every particle of butter 
which may be floating on the top, and serve. 

To Dry Mushrooms. — Wipe them clean, take 
away the brown part and peel off the skin ; lay 
them on sheets of paper to dry, in a cool oven, 
when they will shrivel considerably. Keep them 
in paper bags, which hang in a dry place. When 
wanted for use, piit them into cold gravy, bring 
them gradually to simmer, and it will be found 
that they will regain nearly their usual size.

moderately-heated oven; put them into tin canisters 
and store them in a dry place. 

Another way. — ^Wash large buttons, lay them 
on sieves, with the stalks upwards, sprinkle salt 
over them to extract the water; when they are 
drained put them into a saucepan and set them in 
a cool oven for an hour, then take them out care- 
fully and lay them by to cool and drain ; boil the 
liquor which comes out of them with a little sauce 
until reduced to half the quantity. Put the mush- 
rooms into a clean, dry jar, and when the liquor is 
cold, cover the mushroom in the jar with it and 
pour boiling suet over it; tie the jar well down

Cucumber Salad. — To one hundred cucumbers 
add a quarter of a peck of small onions. Peel Iwtli 
and cut them into thin slices ; cover with salt, and

up to a teacupfuly of a tenacious mass so thick tliat 
a teaspoon will stand up in it, and as smooth as 
honey. Dilute it with vin^ar till it assumes the 
consistence of thick cream. No salad mixture is so 
smooth and rich as this, and at the same time the 
original oily flavor is completely lost, from the ratv 
egg converting the oil into an emulsion. A little 
anchovy may be added if desired. 

Itaijan Salad Dressing. — ^Peel two well 
boiled potatoes and rub through a sieve, add a few 
shreds of raw onion, and the pounded yelks of two

CincKEN Salad. — ^Minoe the white meat of a 
chicken fine, or pull it in bits ; chop the white |)art3 
of celery; prepare a salad dressing thus: Rub the 
yelks of hard-boiled eggs smooth with a spoon, put 
to each yelk a teaspoonful of made mustard, half as 
much salt, a tablespoonful of oil, and a windlass of 
strong vin^ar ; put the celery on a large dish, lay 
the chicken on that, then pour it over the dressing. 
Lettuce, cut small, in the place of celery, may be 
used. Cut the whites of the ^gs in rings to garnish 
the salad. Turkey meat prepared in the same 
way makes alnnxst as good a dish. 

Lobster Salad. — Boil the fish for half an hour, 
afterwards rubbing the shell with oil ; preserve this 
with the Goral to garnish the dish. Extract the 
meat, and lay carefully on some nice white lettuce 
in the centre of the dish. Make a dresnng of two 
hard-boiled ^gs rubbed smooth in two tablespoon- 
fuls of vinegar; add one tablespoonful of English 
mustard, three of salad oil, one of white powdered 
sugar, a teaspoonful of salt, some of black pepper, 
one pinch of Cayenne, and he yelks of two raw 
eggs ; mix together and pour over the fish, dressing

PUDDINGS AND PASTRY, 
PUDDINGS. 

A few general remarks res[>eeting the various in- 
gredients of which puddings are composed, may he 
acceptable as preliminary to the receipts in this de- 
partment. 

Fhur should be of the best quality, and perfectly 
dry, and sifted before being used ; if in the lesist 
damp, the paste made from it will certainly be 
hea\7'. 

Batter J unless fresh is used, should be washed 
from the salt, and well squeezed and wrung in a 
cloth, to get out all the water and buttermilk, which, 
if left in, assists to make the paste heavy. 

Lard should be perfectly sweet, which may lie 
ascertained by cutting the bladder through, aud, if 
the knife smells sweet, the lard is good. 

8ud should be finely chopped, perfectly free fi'oui 
skin, and quite sweet ; during the pr(kH>K8 of chop- 
ping, it should be lightly dredged with flour, which 
prevents the pieces from sticking together. Beef 
suet is considered the best, but veal suet, or the out- 
side &t of a loin or neck of mutton, makes good

crasts, as also the skimmings in which a joijt of 
mutton has been boiled, but wiHioui vegetables. 

Clarified Beef Dripping answers very well for 
kitchen pies, puddings, cakes, or for family use. A 
very gocxl short crust may be made by mixing with 
it a small quantity of moist sugar; but care must be 
taken to use the dripping sparingly, or a very dis- 
agreeable flavor will be imparted to the paste. 

The freshness of all pudding ingredients is of 
much importance, as one bad article will taint the 
whole mixture. 

When the freshness of eggs is doubtful, break 
each one separately in a cup before mixing them all 
together. Should there be a bad one amongst them, 
it can be thrown away ; whereas, if mixed with the 
good ones, the entire quantity would be spoiled. 
The yelks and whites beaten separately make the 
articles they are put into much lighter. 

Raisins and dried fruits for puddings should be 
carefully picked, and, in many cases, stoned. Cur- 
rants should be well washed, pressed in a cloth, and 
placed on a dish before the fire to get thoroughly 
dry; they should then be picked carefully over, 
and every piece of grit or stone removed from 
amongst them. To plump them, some cooks pour 
boiling water over them, and then dry them before 
the fire. 

Batter pudding should l>e smoothly mixed and 
free from lumps. To insure this, first mix the flour 
with a very small proportion of milk, and add the

remaiuder by degrees. Should the pudding be very 
lumpy, it may be strained through a hair sieve. 

AU boiled puddings should be put on in boUing 
loater, which must not be allowed to stop simmer- 
ing, and the pudding must always be covered with 
the water ; if requisite, the saucepan should be kept 
filled up. 

To prevent a pudding boiled in a cloth from 
Fticking to the bottom of the saucepan, place a small 
plate or saucer underneath it, and set the pan on a 
trivet over the fire. If a mould is used, this precau- 
tion is not necessary, but care must be taken to 
keep the pudding well covered with water. 

For dishing a boiled pudding as soon as it comes 
out of the pot, dip it into a basin of cold water, and 
the cloth will then not adhere to it. Great expedi- 
tion is necessary in sending puddings to table, as, 
by standing, they quickly become heavy, batter 
puddings particularly. 

For baked or boiled puddings, the moulds, cups, 
or basins should be always buttered before the mix- 
ture is put in them, and they should be put into the 
saucepan directly after they are filled. 

Scrupulous attention should be paid to the clean- 
liness of pudding-cloths, as, from neglect in this par- 
ticular, the outsides of boiled puddings frequently 
taste very disagreeable. As soon as possible after 
it is taken off the pudding, it should be soaked in 
water, and then well washed without soap, unless 
it be very greasy. It should be dried out of doors,

then folded up, and kepi in a dry plaoe. When 
wanted for uae, dip it in hoiliDg water, and dredge 
't slightly with flour. 

The dry iifkffredimts for puddings are better fov 

ig mixed some time bdbre they ace wanted ; the 
d portion should only be added just befcure the 
ag is put into the saucepan. 

.1 pinch of salt is an improvement to the gener- 
ality of puddings; but this ingredient should be 
added very sparingly, as the flavor should not be 
detected. 

When baked puddings are sufficiently solid, turn 
them out of the dish they were baked in, bottom 
uppermost, and strew over them, fine sifted sugar. 

When baked puddings are not done through, and 
yet the outside is sufficiently brown, cover them 
over with a piece of white paper until thoroughly 
cooked ; this prevents them from getting burnt. 

All batter puddings fall soon after they are baked. 
They ought to be served immediately after they are 
done. Indian puddings require loo^ and slow 
baking. Bice should be baked quiokly. Tapk)ca 
and other puddings of the kind should bake in ft 
moderate oven like custards. All cake puddings 
should be baked in the san^ manner as cakes of 
nearly the i^me composition ; as, for instance, sponge 
puddings quick, and plum puddti^ a long time.

SoYER^s New Christmas Pubwn©. — ^This re-

son of the year, save tons of fruit and other expen- 
sive ingredients, which are partly wasted for the 
want of knowing how to turn them to the best ad- 
vantage. This pudding will be found sufficient for 
eight persons after a Christmas dinner. Carefully 
prepare the following, previous to mixing the pud- 
ding : Four ounces of stoned raisins, four ounces 
of sultanas, half a pound of well-cleaned currants, 
half a pound of beef suet chopped fine, two ounces 
of powdered white sugar, two ounces of flour, half 
a pound of bread crumbs, twelve bitter almonds

if required; let it nmmer two hoars and thirty 
minutes, turn out of the cloth and serve on a hot 
dish. Serve j^ain, if pref^rcd, or with the sauce 
only. After which, when at the dining-room door, 
pour romid a gill of either brandy or mm, which 
set on fire with a piece of paper ; place the dish on 
the table, let burn half a minute, and pour the fol- 
lowing sauce over £i?om <iie sauee-boat ; after which 
cut seven or eight slices from the pudding cross- 
wise, or according to number, when help, and serve 
very hot. The sauce I prefer with it is as follows : 
Make half a pint of ordinary plain melted butter, 
rather thick^ add to it two teaspoonfuls of sugar, 
the juice of half a lemon, and a pat of butter ; stir 
quickly, pour over your pudding when very hot, 
or serve the sauce separately in a sauce-boat. 
Though the above pudding is not very expensive, 
it requires a little time and attention to do it prop- 
erly; and well will be repaid the housewife who 
will take the trouble, as above described. In the 
event of some of the ingredients, such as almonds, 
candied orange or lemon-peel, not being obtainable 
in some country places, the pudding will still be 
good, although not so delicate in flavor.

YABiOUS KINDS OP PASTRY. 

In making pastry the cook should be particularly 
clean and neat. Her utensils should be kept in 
order, and when they are done with they should be 
carefuUt cleaned and put in tlieir places Her 
paste-board and roHing-pin, let it be remembcreil, 
should, after using, be well scoured with hot water 
alone. She should not use soap or sand. A iivar- 
ble slab is preferable to a \^tiv(\ for rolling ])aste. 
Both are generally made too small to be convenient.

making a p:iste a good cook will have no waste of 
any kind, and imrticiilarly nlie will not niake more 
at one time than she wants, under the idea that she 
can keep it in flour till the next time of making; 
for it is ten to one but that the old paste will sfioil 
the new. No flour excei)t the very Ix'St can be used 
for fine descrii)tions of pastry, and in damp waither 
it should be dried before the fire. Clarified drij)- 
ping, good lard, marrow, salt butter, well washed, 
may be used for ordinary pastry ; indeed, if they 
are pure and sweet they will form good i>astrr, 
with good flour and good management. In wealthy 
families, however, where economy is not an object, 
and everything for the table is required to be of the 
fii*st quality, the safest plan is to ase the best fresh 
butter. The fat that settles on stews, and on the 
broth in which meat has Ijeen boiled, may be used 
for pastr}', that is, providcnl it is tasteless. Suet is 
sometimes used for meat pies, but though it makes 
a light crust, when hot, it does not eat well when 
cold. 

A great deal more butter, or fat of some kind or 
other, was formerly directed to be ased iu making 
pastry than at present For ordinary purposes, 
half the weight of lani or butter is sufficient, but in 
the richest crusts the quantity should never exceed 
the weight of flour. K^gs may be added to cin*ich 
the crust. Use no more water or other liquid in 
making paste than is absolutely necessar)', or^ia 
other words, take care not to ^^put out the miller^B

eye/' that is, to make the paste too moist. The 
great thing is to incorporate the flour well with the 
fat, which you cannot do if you allow too much 
water or milk in the first instance. 

The under or side crust, which should be thin, 
should not be made so rich as the top crust, as 
otherwise it will make the gravy or syrup greasy. 
All dishes in which pies are to be baked should be 
buttered or greased round the edges to prevent the 
crust from sticking, and if there be an under crust, 
all over the inside, and the same must be done with 
tins or saucers. 

There is a number of other little things to be at- 
tended to in making pastry, which we will enumer- 
ate in as few words as we can. Fruit pies or large 
tarts should have a hole made in the middle of the 
crust. 

Flaky and Short Crusts. — In making a flaky 
crust a part of the fat should be worked with the 
hand to a cream, and then the whole of the flour 
well rubbed into it before any water or milk is 
added. The remaining fat must be stuck on the 
paste and be rolled out. For crisp crust, by far the 
most wholesome, the whole of the fat should be 
rubbed in and thoroughly incorporated with the 
flour. Water or milk must be added when this is 
done, and the dough, or rather paste, made up. 
The pie-board and rolling-pin should be well dusted 
with flour, and the dough should be well beaten 
with the pin to thoroughly mix it^ and render it

light. Mind, in rolling out paste do not drive Uie 
pin bad^wards and forwards, but always keep roll- 
ing from you. In making flaky crusts the paste 
must be rolled, out thin, and the fat or butter laid 
all over it ; then roll it up and beat it till it puffs 
up in little bladders ; it should be then finally rolled 
out and put in the oven as quickly as possible. 

Raised Crust. — Put two pounds and a half of 
flour on the paste-board, and put on the fii'e in a 
saucepan three-quarters of a pint of water and half 
a pound of good lard ; when the water boils, make 
a hole in the middle of the flour, pour in the water 
and lard by degrees, gently mix it with a spoon, 
and when it is well mixed, then knead it with your 
hands till it becomes stiff; dredge a little flour to 
prevent it sticking to the board, or you cannot, 
make it smooth ; then set it aside for an hour, and 
keep it cool ; do not roll it with your rolling-pin, 
but roll it with your hands, about the thickness of 
a quart pot; cut it into six pieces, leaving a little 
for the covOTs ; put the left hand, clenched, in the 
middle of one of the pieces, and with the other on 
the outside, work it up against the back of the left 
to a round or oval shape. It is now ready for the 
meat, whicn must be cut into small pieces with 
some &t, and pressed into the pie ; then cover H 
with the paste previously rolled out to a proper 
thickness, and of the size of the pie; put this lid on 
tibe pte and press it together with your thumb and

Puff-Paste. — ^This paste is nearly the same as 
what we have called flaky ehist^ and erf course made 
upon the same principles. If eggs are desireil^ 
allow three yelks to a pound of butter or lard. 
Kub a fourth part of the fat to a •eream, then mix 
the eggs with it, and afterwards the flour. A very 
little water will sofQce to wet it. Beat it with .the 
pin to juake it flaky ; roll it out thin three times^ 
putting in a portion of the &it each time, and roll it 
from you ; afl:er each rolling beat it well. 

Superior P^jff-Paste.— One pound of flour, 
one pound of good butter, the yelk of an egg well 
beaten, and the juice of half a lemon. Tlie paste 
must be made with cool hands, ^nd in a cool place. 
Put the flour, into a pan, make a hole ia the middle, 
and put in the egg and lemoa-juice, then cold 
water — enough, together, to make a tolerably stiff, 
but not too stiff, paste. Boll it i99t, and put n 
layer of batter over it in patches, sprinkle £ome 
dry flour over this (not tliat of the pound ficst 
weighed ; that should all be wetted), fold over the

is usee]. The paste should be put on to the dishes 
in about three layers^ and should be put into a quick 
oven to bake. 

Sweet Paste. — ^This is suitable to fruit tails 
generally, apples, iierhajis, excepted, for which we 
recommend a puff paste. To three-quarters of a 
pound of butter put a i>ound and a half of flour, 
three or four ounces of sifted loaf sugar, the yelks 
of two eggs, and half a pint of new milk. Bake it 
In a moderate oven. 

Crust for Savory Pies. — To two pounds of 
flour, one and a half of butter or lanl, and the yelks 
of three eggs ; rub part of the fat to a cream with 
the eggs, then rub in the flour; wet with cold water, 
and roll out with the remainder of the butter. This 
crust is suitable for pigeon, mbbit, liarc, and other 
savory pies. 

IcrxG Pastry. — When nearly baked enough, 
take the im^ry put of the oven and sift fine |X)wdereil 
sugar over it. Ileplace it in the oven, and hold 
over it till the sugar is melted a hot imn shovel.

French Crust for Raised Pies. — ^To every 
pound of flour allow half a saltspoonful of salt, two 
eggs, third of a pint of water, six ounces of butter. 
Spread the flour, which should be sifted and 
thoroughly <lry, on the paste-board ; make a hole 
in the centre, into which put the butter; work it 
lightly into the flour, and when quite fine, add 
the salt; work the whole into a smooth paste with 
the €»ggs (yelks and whites) and water, and make it 
very firm. Knead the paste well, and let it be 
rather stiff, that the sides of tlie pie may be easily 
raised, and that they do not afterwards tumble or 
shrink. 

Pie Crust. — For Meed Plea : Take one pound 
of dried flour and rub into it six ounces of lard, six 
ounces of butter, a small quantity of salt, and a 
half teaspoon ful of baking powder. Mix all these 
ingredients well together, and then use as much 
water as will make them into a nice stiff jiasto. 
Roll it out, let it stand for about iQw minutes and 
then roll it once more before putting it on the meat. 
Tlie pie should be baked in a moderately quick 
oven. For Frail Pies: Take one |K)und of dried 
flonr, and one pound of butter, well squeeze<l in a 
clean cloth, to get the salt out. Break the butter 
with your fingers amongst the flour, as fine as

keep well for four or five months. 

Black Currant Tart. — Lightly stem and top 
the currants, being careful not to bruise them ; put 
them into a tart-dish with a rim of paste, and, as 
they are considered to be too rich by themselves,

cider to dilute their flavor ; throw in a good deal 
of sugar, cover them with a top crust, and bake 
rather more tlian an hour.

your cherries ; take an equal weight of very ripe 
red currants, press them through a sieve, add the

and bake it for an hour. 

Raspberry Cream Tart. — ^This is a delicious 
summer dish, and is prepared as follows : Roll out 
some thin puff-paste, and lay it in a patty-pan ; put 
in some raspberries, and strew over them some very 
finely pounded sugar. Put on the covering paste, 
and bake the tart. Cut it open, and put in half a 
pictt ^f cream, the yelks of two or three eggs, well

with tbin paste, fill it with the mixture, and bake 
it a quarter of an hour, or a little more> if requisite. 

Lemon Tart. — Mix well together the juice and 
grated rinds of two large lemons, half a pound of 
powdered loaf sugar, two eggs, and the crumb of 
two sponge-cakes ; beat it thoroughly smooth, and

leaving the shell about a quarter of an inch thick ; 
place them in order on a papered baking sheet, the 
hollow side upwards, and put again in the oven, 
taking care they do not acquire any more color;

CREAMS AND DES8EBTS. 259 

Rub the pan with a piece of butter, and fry the pan- 
cakes thin. 

Orange Nuts. — ^Take seven ounces of flour, 
seven of sugar, and three eggs, one ounce and a half 
of orange-peel, and the same of lemon-peel. Beat 
the eggs with the sugar for a quarter of an hour, 
add the flour and peels, beating it till no flour is 
visible. Form them into little balls, and bake them 
like the others. 

Compote aux Confitures. — ^Peel some apples, 
leave them whole, but take out the cores. Put a 
little water in the preserving pan and let the apples 
cook, with a large lump of sugar, taking great care 
that they do not break. Place the apples in a glass 
dish, and when they are cold fill the centre of each 
with apricot jam, or any other recherchi preserve. 
Boil the liquid until it jellies, pour it into a dish, 
that it may take its form, let it cool, and then put 
it over the apples without breaking it. The French 
receipt adds that the jelly will leave the dish easily 
if it be dipped for an instant into hot water, but as 
this would be likely to dull the jelly, it is a better 
plan to just dip, shape, jelly, and all into cold water, 
a plan followed by good confectioners. 

Washington, or Cream Pie. — One cup of 
sugar, one cup of milk, two and a half cups of flour, 
half a cup of butter, one egg, one teaspoonful of 
cream of tartar. Bake in round jelly tins, and split 
when cold. For the cream: One pint of milk, four

tablespoonfiils of sugar, one tablespoonful of flonr, 
one egg, and a lump of butter the size of a walnut. 
Flavor with lemon or vanilla, boil the milk, stir in 
the butter, sugar, etc., when boiling, and let it boil 
two or three minutes. Flavor when cold, pour the 
cream on the cake^ and put together like jelly cake. 
This makes two cakes. 

Custard Fritters. — ^Beat the yelks of four 
eggs with a dessertspoonful of flour, a little nutmeg, 
salt and brandy; add half a pint of cream; sweeten 
it to taste, and bake it in a small dish for a quarter 
of an hour. When cold, cut it into quarters, and 
dip them into a batter made with a quarter of a 
pint each of milk and cream, the whites of the four 
eggs, a little flour, and a good bit of grated ginger; 
fry them lyown ; gmte sugar over them, and serve 
them as hot as possible. 

Bjjn Fritters. — Dip stale sliced sugar^biscuit 
in milk, with two or three eggs beaten light and 
stirred in, till completely saturated, then frj' them a 
light brown, and dip them iiaimediately in })ounded 
cinnamon and sugar. Serve tliem very ho(. 

Apple FRiTTBRS.-^Pare and core some fine 
large pippins, and cut them into round slices. 
Soak them in wine, sugar and nutn^ for two or 
three hours. Make a batter of four eggs, a table- 
S])oonful of rose-water, one of wine, and one of milk; 
thicken with enough flour, stirred in by degrees, to 
make a batter ; mix it two or three hours betbre it

IS wanted, that it may be light. Heat some butter 
in a frying-pan ; dip each slice of apple separately 
in the batter, and fry them brown ; sift pounded 
sugar, and grate nutmeg over them. 

Cherry Frftters. — ^Take half a pound of ripe 
Mayduke cherries; stone and halve them; make a 
pint of new milk pretty hot, sweeten it, and pour 
it upon your cherries, then well beat four eggs, put 
them with the cherries, stir all well together, add a 
little flour to bind it ; put it into a fiying-pau, a 
spoonful at a time, and when the fritters are done, 
serve with sugar sifted over them. 

Elegant FRrrTERS.-*7&ke eight ^gs, sixteen 
tablespoonfuls of flour, a little salt, and milk suf- 
ficient to make a batter, mix and fry in butter«

Snitz and Knep. — ^Take of sweet dried apples 
(dried with the skins on, if you can get them) about 
one quart. Put them in the bottom of a porcelain 
or tin-lined boiler with a cover. Take a nice piece 
of smoked ham washed very clean, and lay on top ; 
add enough water to cook them nicely. About 
twenty minutes before dishing up, add the following 
dumplings. — Dumplings — Mix a cup of warm milk 
with one egg, a little salt, and a little yeast, and 
enough flour to make a sponge. When light, work 
into a loaf. Let stand until about twenty minutes 
before dinner, then cut off slices or lumps^ and lay 
on the apples, and let steam through.

262 CBEAMS AND DESSERTS. 

Stewed Pears. — Take six large and ripe pears, 
peel, core and cut them lengthways. Put them 
into a very clean stewpan, cover them with the 
sugar. Peel the lemon very finely, cut the rind 
into long strips, and squeeze the juice of the lemon 
on the sugar. Gently shake the pan until the sugar 
is dissolved, place the stewpan on a very slow fire 
for fifteen minutes, shake it again once or twice, and 
turn each piece with a fork. Let it stew slowly 
again for ten minutes. Place on a dish to cool. 
Dress them on a flat china or glass dish, pour the 
syrup over, and serve. 

Chooolate Caramel. — ^Half apound of choco- 
late, thr^e pounds of dark brown sugar, one-eighth 
of a pound of butter, a small teacup of milk ; season 
with vatfilla, or grated lemon or orange-peel. Boil 
it very quickly over a hot fire, stirring constantly. 
When it becomes hard on being dropped in water, 
take it ofi^ the fire and stir for a few moments before 
pouring into buttered dishes. Before it is quite cool 
cut into little squares. Those who like the craramel 
very hard need pot stir it, as this makes it "sugary." 
The grated peel should not be put in till the caramel 
is taken from the fire. 

Caramels. — ^Two cups of brown sugar, one cup 
of molasses, a piece of butter the size of an egg ; 
three tablcspoonfuls of flour. Boil these together 
for twenty-five minutes. Then add half a pound 
of grated diocolate dissolved in one cup of sweet

milk. Let it boil until it will harden when dropped 
into water (stirring constantly) ; take it from the 
fire and add one teaspoonful of vanilla ; pour it in 
buttered plates to cool ; just before it is hard mark 
it into small squares. 

Burnt Sugar. — Take one and a half tablespoon- 
fuls of white sugar and put it in a ladle over the 
fire, and stir with a wooden spoon. When the 
sugar is black, add of water one gill and a half; let 
it cool, strain, and keep it in a bottle. It is used 
for coloring soup, gravy, and other dishes, and can 
be put in ice cream to color it. 

Friar's Omelette. — Boil a dozen apples as for 
sauce, stir in a quarter of a pound of butter, and 
the same of white sugar ; when cold, add four well- 
beaten eggs; put it into a baking-dish strewn thickly 
with crumbs of bread, 9o as to stick to the bottom 
and sides ; strew crumbs of bread plentifully over 
the apple mixture when in the baking-^ish ; bake, 
turn out, and grate sugar over it. 

Angel's Food. A New Dish. — Make a rich 
custard, pour it in a glass bowl, and put a layer of 
sliced cake on it. Stir some finely-powdered sugar 
into quince or apple jelly, and drop it on the cake. 
Pour syllabub on the cake, and then put on another 
layer of cake, and icing. 

Chocolate Butter. — Stir quarter of a pound 
of butter over the fire until quite soft and creamy ; 
put two cakes of good vanilla-flavored chocolate

on a tin plate, and add cream until they are soft 
enough to mix with the butter. Stir all well to- 
gether. Serve cold, to use like butter with bread 
or biscuit. 

Chocolate Chaklotte Rttsse. — Having 
soaked in cold water an ounce of isinglass, or of 
gelatine, shave down three ounces of the best choco- 
late, which must have no spice or sugar in it, and 
mix it gradually into a pint of cream, adding the 
soaked isinglass. Set the cream, chocolate, and 
isinglass over the fire, in a porcelain kettle, and 
boil it slowly till the isinglass is dissolved thor- 
oughly, and the whole is well mixed. Then take 
it off the fire and let it cool. Have ready eight 
yelks of eggs and four whites, beaten all together 
till very light ; and stir them gradually into the 
mixture, in turn with half a pound of powdered 
ioaf sugar. Simmer the whole over the fire, but do 
not let it quite boil. Then take it off, and whip it 
to a strong froth. Line your moulds with sponge 
cake, and set them on ice. If you like a strong 
chocolate flavor, take four ounces of the cocoa. 

Charlotte Russe. — ^Take an ounce of isinglass 
or of gelatine, and soften it by soaking it awhile in 
cold water. Then boil it slowly in a pint of cream, 
sweetened with a quarter of a ])ound of fine loaf 
sugar (adding a handful of fresh rose-leaves, if con- 
venient, tied in a thin muslin bag), till it is 
thoroughly dissolved, and well mixed. Take it off

the fire ; set it to cool ; and beat together till very 
light and thick, four whole eggs, and the yelks only 
of four others. Stir the beaten eggs gradually into 
the mixture of cream, sugar, and isinglass, and set 
it again over the fire. Stir it well, and see that it 
only simmers; taking it off before it comes quite 
to a boil. Then, while it is warm, stir in sufficient 
extract of roses to give it a high rose-flavor and a 
fragrant smell. Have ready two moulds lined with 
lady cake, or almond sponge cake. Fill them with 
the mixture, and set them on ice. Before they go to 
table, ice the tops of the charlotte, flavoring the 
icing with rose. 

Charlotte de Russe. — ^Take a little less than 
one ounce of gelatine, an<l dissolve in one pint of 
new milk. Strain into one pint of thick cream made 
very sweet, and set this in a cool place or on the 
ice. Take the whites of seven e^s, and beat to a 
froth ; then add them to the cream, and beat light. 
Flavor with vanilla, and keep on the ice until 
wanted. Line the moulds with very light sponge 
cake, and fill with the above when wanted. 

Jam or Marmalade Charlotte {without 
Eygs), — Cut five slices of bread a quarter of an inch 
thick, trim oft* the crust, lay them in a dish, and 
j)our over six ounces of dissolved fresh butter. Put 
it in the oven for ten minutes, and, when the bread 
is cold and the butter all absorbed, spread each 
piece of bread a quarter of an iuch thick with smrj

kind of jam or marmalade, and over that put a tea- 
spoonful of powdered loaf sugar. Blanch and chop 
two ounces of sweet almonds, butter a plain mould, 
strew the almonds over, lay in the slices of bread 
and jam ; place a dish over the mould, and bake in 
a quick oven. 

Buttered Orange Juice, a cjold dish. — Mix 
the juice of seven Seville oranges with four spooi>- 
fuls of rose-water, and add the whole to the yelks 
of eight and whites of four eggs, well beaten ; then 
strain the liquors to half a pound of sugar pounded, 
stir it over a gentle fire, and when it begins to thicken 
put about the size of a small walnut of butter ; 
keep it over the fire a few minutes longer, then pour 
it into a fiat dish, and serve to eat cold. It may be 
done in a china basin in a saucepan of boiling water, 
the top of which will just receive the basin. 

Cakes for Dessert. — Four eggs, half a pound 
of butter, half a pound of sugar, half a pound of 
flour. Mix the butter, sugar, and yelks of the 
eggs thoroughly, then add the flour and mix again, 
then the whites of the eggs beaten to a thick froth. 
Grate in a little lemon rind. Put in little dishes, 
filling each about one-third full, and bake till done. 

Apple Charlotte. — Take any number of ap- 
ples you may desire to use ; peel them, cut them 
into quarters, and take out the core. Cut the quar- 
ters into slices, and let them cook over a brisk fire, 
with butter, sugar, and powdered cinnamon, until

they are en marmalade. Cut thin slices of cramb of 
bread, dip them in butter, and with them line the 
sides and bottom of a tin shape. Fill the middle 
of the shape with alternate layers of the apple and 
any preserve you may choose, and cover it with 
more thin slices of bread. Then place the shape in 
an oven, or before the fire, until the outside is a fine 
brown, and turn it out upon a dish, and serve it 
either hot or cold. For croqaetlea de pommes you 
cook the apple just as for the Charlotte; but instead 
of putting it into the jelly shape you roll into balls, 
or rather cakes, which you cover with egg and 
bread crumbs, and fry of a rich brown. 

PoMMES AU Riz. — ^Peel a number of apples of a 
good sort, take out the cores, and let them simmer 
in a syrup of clarified sugar, with a little lemon-peel. 
Wash and pick some rice, and cook it in milk, 
moistening it therewith by little and little, so that 
the grains may remain whole. Sweeten it to taste, 
and add a little salt and a taste of lemon-peel. 
Spread the rice upon a dish, mixing some apple pre- 
serve with it, and place the apples upon it, and fill 
up the vacancies between the apples with some of 
the rice. Place the dish in the oven until the sur- 
face gets brown, and garnish with spoonfuls of 
bright-colored preserve or jelly. 

Delicious Dish op Apples. — ^Take two pounds 
of apples, pare and core them, slice them into a pan; 
add one pound of loaf sugar, the juioe of three

lemons^ and the grated rind of one. Let these boil 
about two hours. Turn it into a mould, and serve 
it with thick custard or cream. 

Gateau be Pommes. — ^Take a few apples, boil 
them with as little water as possible, and make them 
into apple sauce, then add a pound and a half of 
sugar, and the juice of a lemon ; boil all together till 
quite firm, and put it into a mould. Gramish it 
with almonds stuck over it. It will keep for many 
months if allowed to remain in the mould. 

Apple Souffle.— Stew the apples with a little 
lemon-peel; sweeten them, then lay them pretty 
high round the inside of a dish. Make a custard 
of the yelks of two eggs, a little cinnamon, sugar, 
and milk. Let it thicken over a slow fire, but not 
boil ; when ready, pour it in the inside of the apple. 
Beat the whites of the eggs to a strong froth, and 
cover the whole. Throw over it a good deal of 
pounded sugar, and brown it of a fine brown. 

Apple in Jelly. — Peel and quarter some good 
apples, and take out the core. Cook them with just 
water enough to cover them, some slices of lemon, 
and clarified sugar, until they are soft. Take out 
the pieces of apple with great care not to break the 
jneces, and arrange them in the jars. Then boil the 
syrup until it will jelly, and pour it over the pieces 
of apple. 

Apple Float. — ^Take six large apples, pare, 
alioe, and stew them in as much water is will cover

them. When well done, press them through a sieve, 
and make very sweet with crushed or loaf sugar. 
While cooling, beat the whites of four eggs to a 
stiff froth, and stir in the apples ; flavor with lemon 
or vanilla. Serve with sweet cream. Quite as 
good as peaches and cream. 

Apple Snow. — Put twelve good tart apples in 
cold water, and set them on a slow fire ; when soft, 
drain off the water, strip the skins from the apples, 
core and lay them in a large glass dish. Beat the 
whites of twelve eggs to a stiff froth, put half a 
pound of powdered white sugar to the apples ; beat 
them, and add the eggs. Basit the whole to a stiff 
snow, and turn into a dessert-dish. 

Floating Island op Apples. — Bake or scald 
eight or nine large apples ; when cold, pare them 
and pulp them through a sieve. Beat up this pulp 
with sugar, and add to it the whites of four or five 
eggs previously beaten up with a small quantity of 
rose-water. Mix this into the pulp a little at a 
time, and beat it until quite light. Heap it up on 
a dish, with a rich custard or jelly round it. 

Apple Island. — Make some good apple sauce, 
which has been fla voiced with lemon and clove, beat 
it up very fine, with loaf sugar enough to taste sweet ; 
add two glasses of sherry, then beat the whites of 
four eggs separately till they are of a light froth, 
strain them into a large basin, beat them up again ; 
^low add two taMespoonfuls of cream, or a little

milk^ aud a quarter of an ounce of isinglass^ dis- 
solved in a'little water, and added to the milk and 
egg froth. Beat it well up, take off the froth with 
a spoon, and lay it on an inverted sieve over a dish. 
When sufficient froth is made, beat the remainder 
up with the apples till the whole is very light aud 
frothy. Place the apples piled high in a glass dish, 
pour some cold custard arownd, not on it, then take 
off the froth and put on the top of the apples. 

Apple Cheese Cakes. — ^Half a pound of apple 
pulp, quarter of a pound of sifted sugar, quarter of 
a pound of butter, four eggs, the rind and juice of 
one lemon. Pare, core, and boil sufficient apples to 
make half a pound when cooked ; add to these the 
sugar, the butter, which should be melted, the eggs, 
leaving out two of the whites, and the grated rind 
and juice of one lemon; stir the mixture well. 
Line some patty-pans with puff-paste, put in the 
mixture, and bake about twenty minutes. 

Apple Pique. — Peel and stew some apples, but 
do not let them break. Place them in a glass dish 
half full of syrup, and put a piece of currant jelly 
on the top of each apple. 

Sponge Cake for Dessert. — One pound of 
sugar, ten eggs, hcdf the weight of the sugar and 
eggs in flour. Beat the yelks of the eggs, flour, and 
sugar together, then add the whites, beaten to a froth, 
when just ready for the oven. Butter square tins, 
put in the mixture one inch deep. This will make

two cakes. Take one of them^ blanche almonds^ 
and stick the small ends of them in the cake, just 
so far that they will stand up, putting them in about 
an inch apart. Then make a custard of three eggs 
to a pint of milk ; sweeten to taste. Pour the cus- 
tard over the cake just before serving. 

A Dish of Snow. — Pare and core a dozen of 
large applas, put them into cold water and stew them 
till soft, then pulp through a sieve, and sweeten it 
to the taste with loaf-sugar. Lay it on the dish on 
which it is to be sent to table, then beat the whites 
of twelve eggs to a strong froth, with half a pound 
of sifted white sugar, and a flavoring of vanilla or 
orange flower. Strew this over the apple pulp very 
high, and it will present all the appearance of a 
veritable dish of §now. 

Sugar Drops. — ^Beat the whites and yelks of 
four eggs separately to a light foam, dilute the yelks 
with two teaspoonfuls of water, and turn them with 
the whites, and beat them some time ; then add by 
degrees a pound of sugar in fine powder, and then 
four ounces of superfine flour, beating the mixture 
constantly. Drop the mixture on white paper, 
placed in a tin plate, in any shape you please, ice 
them over with sugar in powder, to prevent run- 
ning, and bake about ten minutes in a moderate 
oven. 

Ice Cream. — To two quarts of cream add one 
pound of white sugar, boil one tablespoonfiil of

arrowroot in a tumbler of railk, mix all together 
imd freeze. It will be found advisable to stir the 
mixture frequently. To give the vanilla flavor, put 
IB with the boiled aiTowroot half a vanilla hcan, 
previously grated. For strawberry and other fruit 
creams, add a little larger proportion of sugar, and 
freeze as soon as possible to prevent curdling. 

Lemon Ice Cream. — To one quart of cream 
dght ounces sugar, one lemon. Grate the lemon- 
rind in the sugar, add the raw cream. Strain and 
fi^eeze very soon. 

Water Ices. — Made with any desired fruit, such 
as lemon, currant, strawberry, raspberry, etc. ; the 
tome to be squeezed, sweetened to taste, and added 
to water. Strain thoroughly before freezing, and 
only use the pure liquid so obtained. Orange water 
ioe should be nearly the pure juice of the orange.

CHAPTER VIII. 

PBESEBYES AND JELLIES. 

BIRECTIOKS FOR PRESERTING FRUITS, ETC. 

Preserves of all kinds should be kept entirely 
secluded from the air and in a dry place. In rang- 
ing them on the shelves of a store-closet, they 
should not be suffered to come in contact with the 
wall. Moisture in winter and spring exudes from 
some of the driest walls, and preserves invariably 
imbibe it, both in diampness and taste. It is neces- 
sary occasionally to look at them, and if they have 
been attacked by mould, boil them up gently again. 
To prevent all risks, it is always as well to lay a 
brandy paper over the fruit before tying down. 
This may be renewed in the spring. 

Fruit jellies are made in the ratio of a quart of 
fruit to two pounds of sugar. They must not be 
boiled quick nor very long. Practice and a gene- 
ral discretion will be found the best guides to regu- 
late the exact time, which necessarily must .be af- 
fected, more or less by local causes. 

To Preserve Peaches. — ^The clear-stone, yel- 
low peaclies, white at the stone, are the best. Weigh 
the firuit after it is pared. To each pound of fruit 

273

274\ PRESERVES AND JELLIES. 

allow a pound of loaf sugar. Put a layer of sugar 
at the bottom of the preserving-kettle, and then a 
layer of fruit, and so on until the fruit is all in. 
Stand it over the fire until the sugar is entirely dis- 
solved ; then boil them until they are clear ; take 
them out piece by piece, and spread them on a dish 
free from syrup. Boil the syrup in the pan until 
it jellies ; when the peaches are cold, fill the jars 
half full with them, and fill up with boiling syrup. 
Let them stand a short time covered with a thin 
cloth, then put on brandy paper, and cover them 
close with corks, skin, or paper. From twenty to 
thirty minutes will generally be suflBcient to preserve 
them. 

Peach Marmalade. — Prepare peaches as for 
jam, boil one hour ; mix equal parts of sugar with 
the jam; when dissolved, pass the whole through a 
sieve ; boil slowly two hours, being very careful not 
to burn ; spread it on plates and set it in a cool 
oven, where it will dry but not burn, for a half day, 
when it will be ready to pack into moulds ; cover 
the moulds with paper dipped into the white of 
eggs, beaten as stiff as possible; it must be entirely 
free from juice, of a dark mahogany color, and 
clear when finished, sufficiently stiff to cut with a 
knife ; keep it cool ; it is liable to mould, which 
can be the more readily removed if a piece of paper, 
closely fitting the edges of the jar, is pre&sed firmly 
on the marmalade before covering with the egg 
paper. No air should be allowed to remain iu the

FBESERVES AND JELLIES. 276 

fniit, which should be packed very closely; and^as 
marmalade is very thick, it will require some care 
to accomplish it. 

Peach Jam. — ^This confection should be made 
of the cling-stone peach in preference, it being more 
juicy and of a higher flavor than the other kind 
of peach, the stone of which separates from the 
pulp. Treat the peaches exactly in the manner 
directed for apricots, using the same quantity of 
sugar. 

Kaspberry Fool. — Put your fruit for a quarter 
of an hour into an oven ; when tender, pulp it 
through a sieve, sugar it, add the crumb of suffi- 
cient sponge-cake to thicken it ; put it into a glass 
mould, or into custard-cups, and lay some thick 
cream on the top. If for immediate use, the cream 
may be beaten up with the fruit 

Raspberry Jam. — Let the raspberries be thor- 
oughly ripe. Mash them with a wooden spoon. To 
every pound of raspberries add a pound of sifted 
sugar. Boil this well together during half an hour, 
stirring it continually, lest it should bum. When 
of a good thickness, put it into pots, let it cool 
thoroughly, and cover with bi-andied paper. 

Celery Preserve. — Cut the blanched part of 
the celery in pieces, and boil it in water with a large 
quantity of ginger until it is quite tender, then 
throw it into cold water and allow it to remain for 
ra hour. Put it over a slow fire in good syrup,

276 FItES£3tVBB AN2> JELIilBS. 

witli some pieces of ginger, and let it remain sira- 
mmnng for an hour. Cool it again, and in the 
meantime thicken the syrup by further evaporation. 
Put the celery in again, and repeat the same pro- 
eess. After a third simmering in this way, taking 
care to keep the syrup thick, put the celery into 
pots, and cover with a syrup. 

Prrserved Lkitucb Stalks. — ^Peel large let- 
tuce stalks that have run to seed, cut them in pieces, 
boil them gently till tender, but not too soft, put- 
ting half a dozen whole red peppers in the water; 
put them to drain; make a syrup and boil the 
stalks up in it just once a day for a week; then 
make a good rich syrup, well skimmed and boiled, 
scraping in some best white ginger ; pour hot over 
the stalks; keep in a covered jar. 

To Preserve Watermelon Einds. — Do not 
cut your linds too thin ; pare off the outside green 
rind ; soak them two days in clean soft water, and 
then drain them. Take six pounds of sugar and 
three pint8 of water, boil to a thick syrup; then 
add your watermelon rinds; boil until they are 
clear ; flavor with orange flower water ; cool, and 
put away in jars for use. 

Preserved Citron. — ^Take some fine citron 
melons, pare, core, and cut them into slices, then 
weigh them, and to every pound of fruit allow three- 
quarters of a pound of the best refined sugar. Make 
a syrup^ skim it clear^ then put in the citrdn and 



Digitized by VjOOQ IC 



PBESERYES AND J^ESLLim. 27? 

ginger, and boil until the citron is quite tender and 
clear. Allow a quarter of a pound of green ginger 
to two good sized melons. When the citron is done, 
put it in the jars, boil the syrup a few minutes 
longer, skira it till perfectly clear, and pour it oVi^r 
the fruit. Fine fresh lemons can be used instead 
of the ginger, if preferred. Four large ones will be 
suflScient for two melons. Slice and boil them with 
the fruit the same as the ginger. Lay upon the top 
of the syrup a double white tissue-paper, cut exactly 
to fit the surface, and paste paper over the top of 
each jar. 

ApRicxyr Jam. — Let the fruit be just in maturity, 
but not over ripe. Remove the skins, then cut the 
apricots in halves. Crack the stones, take out the 
kernels, bleach them in boiling water, and then 
pound tliem in a mortar. Boil the broken stones, 
skins, and parings in double the quantity of water 
required for the jam. B.educe it in the boiling to

apricots put a quarter of a pint of this juice, a pound 
of sifted loaf sugar, and the pounded kernels. Put 
it on the fire, which should be brisk, and stir the 
whole with a wooden spoon until it is of a nice con- 
sistence, but without being very stiflF, or it would 
have a bad flavor. Put it immediately into pots,

surface of the jam in each pot, and tie egged paper 
over each pot. 

To Preserve Hedge Pears. — ^Take four pounds 
of sugar and two pounds of water, boil to a mid- 
dling thick syrup. Pare six pounds of good ripe 
hedge pears, and leave them whole. Boil these in 
your syrup until done; cool, flavor with orange 
flower water, and put away in jars for use. 

Pe4R8 for the Tea Table. — Take ripe pears 
and wipe them carefuUy, place a layer, stem upward, 
in a stone jar, sprinkle over sugar, then set in another 
layer of pears, and so on till the jar is filled. To 
every gallon put in one and a half pints of water. 
Cover the top of the jar with pie crust, and set it in 
a slow oven for two hours. 

Preserving Pears. — Gather the fruit when not 
too ripe, peel, then cut them into halves or quarters, 
weigh them, and to every pound of fruit allow one 
pound of the best white sugar. Put the fruit in a 
stone jar with a layer of fruit and one of sugar until 
you get all the fruit covered. Let them remain in 
the jar one night, then take your fruit out and lay 
them on dishes. Put the sugar into a bi'ass or bell 
metal kettle and make a thick syrup, then put your 
pears into the syrup, and let them boil until they 
look clear, and they are ready for use. 

Blackberry Jelly. — Gather the fruit when 
perfectly ripe, and in very dry weather. Put the 
blackberries into a jar and place the jar in hot water,

keeping it boiling until the juice is extracted from 
the fruit. Pass it through a fine sieve or jelly-bag 
without much pressure. For every pint of juice 
add fourteen ounces of sugar, and boil in a clean 
preserving-pan about five and twenty minutes, care- 
fully taking off the scum as it rises to the surface. 
Place it hot in small jars and cover it down with 
thin tissue-paper, dipped in brandy, and brown paper 
over it. Keep it in a cool, dry place. 

Blackberbies. — Preserve these as strawberries 
or currants, either liquid, or jam, or jelly. Black- 
berry jelly or jam is an excellent medicine in sum- 
mer complaints or dysentery. To make it, crush a 
quart of fully ripe blackberries with a pound of the 
best loaf sugar, put it over a gentle fire, and cook it 
until thick, then put to it a gill of the best fourth- 
proof brandy. Stir it awhile over the fire, then put 
it in pots. 

Greengage Jam. — To every pound of fruit, 
weighed before being stoned, allow three-quarters 
of a pound of lump sugar. Divide the greengages, 
take out the stones, and put them in a preserving- 
pan. Bring the fruit to a boil, then add the sugar, 
and keep stirring it over a gentle fire until it is 
melted. Remove the scum as it rises, and just be- 
fore the jam is done, boil it rapidly for five minutes. 
To ascertain when it is sufficiently boiled, pour a 
little on a plate, and if the syrup thickens and ap- 
pears firm it is done. Have ready all the kernels 
blanched^ put them into the jaim^ give them one

boil, and pour tibe preserve into pots. When cold, 
cover down with oiled papers, and over these tissue- 
paper, brushed over on both sides with the white 
of an egg. 

Greengages. — ^Weigh a pound of sugar to a 
pound of fruit, the largest, when they begin to get 
soft, are the best. Split them and take out the ker- 
nels and stew them in part of the sugar. Take out 
the kernels from the shells and blandi them. The 
next day strain off the syrup and boil it with the 
remaining sugar about ten minutes. Skim it and 
add the fruit and kernels; skim it until clear, then 
put into small pots with syrup and kernels. 

Bottled Green Gooseberries. — Cut off the 
tops and stalks of some gooseberries which have not 
attained their full growth, and put them into wide- 
necked bottles which have been well washed and 
dried. Cork them loosely, and set them in a pan 
of cold water, which should be brought to boil very 
gradually. Leave the gooseberries to simmer until 
they assume a shrunken appearance, when take the 
bottles out. If they are not full, take the contents 
of one bottle to fill up the rest, and pour sufficient 
boiling water into each bottle a^s will cover the 
gooseberries. Cork the bottle close, and tie a blad- 
der over the tops, keeping them in a dry, cool place 
until wanted. When required for tarts or puddings, 
pour the water away, and add as much sugar as 
would be necessary for fresh fruit, which they closely

Goo8£«£BBY Jelly. — This is ma<j6 ^acaptly a<5 
black currant jelly ; use no wat^ with the fruit, 
but press it firmly, and make the remains of the 
pulp into jam ; if desired to remove the skins, pass 
the pulp through a colander, allow one pound of 
sugar for one of jam. 

Gooseberry and Raspberry jBiriiY.— ^Take 
any quantity of fine red goo8eberri€8, .a quarts as 
many white ones, and half a quarter as many rasp- 
berries ; pick the fruits, and put them in a kettle 
for preserves, with as many pounds of sugar in 
pieces as you have pounds of fruit. Boil over a 
quick fire, skimming carefully, and continue boiling 
until your jelly, turned upon a napkin, fixes or con- 
geals in a moment. This is a proof that your jelly 
is sufficiently cooked. Remove it from the fire, 
and turn it through a hair sieve. Let it drain 
without squeezing, and turn the first results into 
your pots. This will be a jelly of the first quality, 
of a beautiful ruby tint, and perfectly transparent. 
Afterwards squeeze and express the remainder into 
another vase. This second part is as good as the 
first, but it has not its transparency. 

Red Gooseberry Jam. — Take the eyes and tails 
from a quantity of red, hairy gooseberries, quite ripe, 
and put them into a preserving-pan with half a 
pint of red currant juice to each half-a-dozen pounds. 
Let them boil until they are all broken and mashed, 
whicti you must aid with a wooden spoon. Then

for every pound of gooseberries add a pound c£ 
sugar, sprinkling it over the fruit. Let the whole 
simmer until reduced to the proper consistence of 
jam, taking care that it does not burn during the 
operation. Then put it into pots. 

Green Gtooseberry Jam. — Grather the finest 
green gooseberries when quite ripe ; take off the tails 
and eyes. Put the berries into a jar, and set them 
in a kettle of boiling water over the fire, until they 
begin to break. Then put them into a preserving 
pan. Use a pound of sugar for each pound of 
gooseberries. Add it to the fruit, which you must 
break as it boils. When of the consistence of jam, 
put it into pots. 

White Gooseberry Jam. — This jam is made 
with the large white gooseberry, which must be 
quite ripe and fresh-gathered. Treat it exactly in 
the same manner as directed for red gooseberry jam, 
omitting the red currant juice. 

Dried Strawberries. — Put three pounds of 
strawberries into a large dish, and sprinkle six 
pounds of white sugar over them. Let them stand* 
until the next day, then scald them and put them 
back into the dish. On the third day place another 
pound of sugar over them, and scald them again. 
In two days more repeat the process. After this, 
place the strawberries on a hair-sieve to drain, and 
then on fresli plates every day, until they are dried. 
They must be kept in tin canisters.

To Preserve Strawberries. — To two iK)ands 
of fine large strawberries, add two pounds of pow- 
dered sugar, and put them in a preserving kettle, 
over a slow fire, till the sugar is melted ; then boil 
them precisely twenty minutes, as fast as possible ; 
have ready a number of small jars, and put the 
fruit in boiling hot. Cork and seal the jars imme- 
diately, and keep them through the summer in a 
cold, dry place. The jars must be heated before the 
hot fruit is poured in, otherwise they will break. 

Strawberry Jelly. — ^Express the juice from 
the fruit through a cloth, strain it clear, weigh, and 
stir to it an equal proportion of the finest sugar 
dried and reduced to powder ; when this is dissolved, 
place the preserving-pan over a very clear fire, and 
stir the jelly often until it boils; clear it carefully 
from scum, and boil it quickly from fifteen to twen- 
ty-five minutes. This receipt is for a moderate 
quantity of the preserve; a very small portion will 
require much less time. 

Strawberry Jam. — Put the fruit into a jar, 
and stand this in a pan of boiling water over the 
fire. As the boiling proceeds, keep mashing the 
«trawberries with a wooden spoon until they are all 
bruised to a pulp. Then put them into a preserv- 
ing-pan, and to every pound add thrQC-quarters of 
a pound of sugar. Boil the whole until of due 
consistence, which will occupy more than half an 
hour ; keeping the jam in constant agitation, lest

the bottom should burn. When done Plough, take 
it off the fire and put it into pots. 

Presekved Pineapple. — Twist out the crown 
of the pineapple, and pare off the hard yellow rind ; 
next slice the fruit about half an inch thick, and 
trim it quite clean around the edges, taking care of 
the trimmings. Put them into a preserving pan 
with one quart of cold water, and boil till reduced 
to half a pint; strain it, then put the slices on the 
lire with the juice and equal weight of fine white 
sugar ; boil gently half an hour. 

Or : Make a thin syrup, a quart of water to two 
pounds of sugar. While this is dissolving, prepare 
the pineapples, eight medium-sized ones, by remov- 
ing the skin, and cutting the flesh into slices, about 
half an inch thick. When the sugar is dissolved, 
and while the syrup is still hot, throw in the fruit. 
Give one boil up; let it boil for a quarter of an 
hour, and put it aside to cool. When cool, boil up 
again, and repeat this three times. This is some 
trouble; but the pineapple will not be enough 
cooked with less than three-quarters of an hour's 
boiling, and if boiled iot that time without a break, 
it is apt to get pappy» Lastly, make a thiok syrup 
of four pomids of sugar to a quart of water, and 
iKld this to tbe other while both are hot. £cil up 
onoe more for a few ininutes, and put away in a 
well-corked or stopp^^ bottle with a wide mouth.

Pineapples without Cooking. — Peel very 
ripe pineapples, cut them in sHcesy take out tlie 
oores^ and weigh the fruit ; allow a pound of double- 
refined loaf sugar to every pound of firuit. Spread 
the sugar evenly over the fruit ; pack it in layers, 
and let it stand twenty-four hours ; thai drain off 
the syrup, and boil it as long as any impurities rise 
to the surfece ; skim it constantly, and pour it over 
the fruit boiling hot. 

Pineapple J*elly. — ^This is set with isinglass. 
To every quart of syrup allow one ounce of shred 
isinglass. To make the syrup, allow to a pint of 
juice a pound of the best loaf sugar. 

Pineapple Marmalade. — To every pound of 
grated pineapple allow a pound of double-refined 
loaf sugar. Boil until thick ; then pack in tumb- 
lers, and paste over them papers wet with the 
I)eaten whites of eggs. Keep in a dry, cool place 
until wanted. 

Pineapple Preserve. — Twist off the top and 
bottom, and pare off the rough outside of pineapples ; 
then weigh them, and cut them in slices, chips, or 
quarters, or cut them into four or rfx, and shapd 
each piece like a whole pineapple ; to each pound 
of fruit put a teacup of water ; put it in a preserving 
kettle; cover it, and set it over the fire, and let them 
boil gently until they are tender and clear; then 
take them from the water by sticking a fork in the 
omtre of each slice, or with m skimmer^ into a dish.

Put to the water white sugar, a pound for each 
pound of fruit; stir it until it is all dissolved ; then 
put in the pineapple, cover the kettle, and let it 
boil gently until transparent ^ throughout ; when 
it is so, take it out, let it cool, and put it into glass 
jars ; as soon as the syrup is a little cooled, pour 
it over them ; let them remain in a cool place until 
the next day, then secure the jars, by tying them 
over in the usual manner. Pineapple done in 
this way is a delicious preserve, but in preserving 
it, by putting it into the syrup without first boiling 
it, makes it little better than sweetened leather. 

Ehubabb Jam. — Cut into pieces about an inch 
long (not peeled), put three-quarters of a pound of 
powdered lump sugar to every pound of rhubarb, 
and leave till morning ; pour the syrup from it and 
boil till it thickens, then add the rhubarb and boil 
gently a quarter of an hour ; tie down with tissue- 
paper dipped in white of egg. It will keep good 
for a year, and is excellent. 

Ehubabb Pbesebve. — ^To every six pounds of 
rhubarb add six pounds of sugar and a quarter of a 
p6und of bruised ginger; the rhubarb to be cut into 
pieces two inches long and put into a stone jar, 
with the sugar in layers, till the sugar is dissolved ; 
take the juice or syrup and boil it with the ginger 
for half an hour, then add the rhubarb and boil 
another half hour.

put them into a china bowl, and, when cold, pour 
the. syrup over. Let them lie three days, then 
make a syrup of three pounds of sugar to five pounds 
of fruit, with no more water than hangs to large 
lumps of the sugar dipped quickly and instantly 
brought out. Boil the plums in this fresh syrup, 
after draining them from the first ; do them very 
gently till they are clear and the syrup adheres to 
them ; put them one by one into small pots, and 
pour the liquor over them. 

To Preserve Purple Plums. — Make a syrup 
of clean brown sugar; clarify it; when perfectly 
clear and boiling hot, pour it over the plums, hav- 
ing picked out all unsound ones and sterns; let them 
remain. in the syrup two days, then drain it off, make 
it boiling hot, skim it, and pour it over again ; let 
til em remain another day or two, then put them in a 
preserving-kettle over the fire, and simmer gently 
until the syrup is reduced, and thick or rich. One 
pound of sugar for each pound of plums. 

Preserved Cherries. — Take large cherries not 
very ripe; stew and stone them; save what juice 
runs from them ; take an equal weight of white 
sugar ; make the syrup of a teacup of water for each 
l)Ound, set it over the fruit until it is dissolved and 
boiling hot, then put in the juice and cherries, boil 
them o-entlv until clear throuorhout : take them from 
the syrup with a skimmer, and spread them on flat

into jars and pots, and pour the syrup carefully 
over ; let them remain open till the next day ; then 
cover as directed. Sweet cherries are improved by 
the addition of a pint of red currant-juice, and half 
a pound of sugar to it, for four or five pounds of 
cherries. 

Cherry Marmalade or Jam. — ^Take out the 
stones and stalks from some fine cherries, and pulp 
them through a cane sieve ; to every three pounds 
of pulp add half a pint of currant-juice, and three- 
quarters of a pound of sugar to each pound of f]*uit ; 
mix together, and boil until it will jelly. Put it 
into pots or glasses. 

Spiced Cherries. — Seven pounds of sour cher- 
ries seeded, three pounds of sugar, one pint of 
vin^ar, cinnamon, cloves, and mace. Boil six 
times ; last time put cherries in and let it come to a 
boil. 

Bottling Cherries. — To every pound of fruit 
add six ounces of powdered lump sugar. Fill the 
jars with fruit, shake the sugar over, and tie each 
jar down with two bladders, as there is danger of 
one bursting during the boiling. Place the jars in 
a boiler of cold water, and after the water has 
boiled, let them remain three hours ; take them out, 
and when cool, put them in a dry place, where they 
will keep over a year. 

Cherry or Strawberry Fool. — Pick the

stems from your fruit; if cherries, stone them, 
bruise them to a pulp, add a sufficiency of loaf 
sugar pounded and sifted, and half a pint of cream 
to a pint of pulp; put it into custard-glasses with a 
layer of raw cream upon the top, and serve. Some 
housekeepers, to avoid the trouble of frequent bak- 
ings, line several tart-dishes with an edge of crust ; 
bake them and keep them for use as required, when 
some preserve or raw fruit as above may be simply 
laid in, and an easy-made tart produced upon an 
emergency. 

Cherry Jam. — ^To every pound of fruit, weighed 
before stoning, allow half a pound of sugar; to 
every six pounds of fruit allow one pint of red cur- 
rant-juice, and to every pint, one pound of sugar. 
Weigh the fruit before stoning, and allow half the 
weight of sugar ; stone the cherries, and boil them 
in a preserving-pan until nearly all the juice is 
dried up; then add the sugar, which should be 
crushed to powder, and the currant-juice, allowing 
one pint to every six pounds Of cherries, (original 
weight,) and one pound of sugar to every pint of 
juice. Boil all together until it jellies, which will 
be in from twenty minutes to half an hour; skim 
the jam well, keep it well stirred, and, a few minutes 
before it is done, crack some of the stoncji and add 
the kernels. 

Currant Jelly. — Pick fine red, but long ripe 
currants from the stems; bruise them, and strain 
tl^e juice from a quart at a time through a thin

a pound of white sugar to each pound of juice; 
stir it until it is all dissolved ; set it over a gentle 
fire ; let it become hot, and boil for fifteen minutes ; 
then try it by taking a spoonful into a saucer ; when 
cold, if it is not quite firm enough, boil it for a few 
minutes longer. 

Black Currant Jelly. — ^It is necessary to add 
a little water to the fruit, in order to strain it, it is 
so very thick, unless jam is made at the same time, 
when a part can be strained for the jelly, and the 
remainder used for jam. After it is boiled so as to 
heat the fruit through, press it little by little until 
all the juice is extracted ; measure the juice, and 
allow one pound of sugar to every pint of juice ; 
mix the juice and sugar, and boil ten minutes 
gently, stirring constantly, when it will be ready 
to put in moulds. Cover with paper wet with 
brandy. 

Black Currant Jam. — To every pound of 
black currants pulped, put a pound of sugar. Boil 
up riie fruit, stirring it continually, until reduced 
by evaporation to the proper consistence. Jams 
may also be made of red and white currants, but 
as they are scarcely ever used, the jelly being so 
much preferred, few persons m^flvc them. The 
black currant is one of the most wholesome of 
jams, and certainly very useful. It has many 
medicinal virtues, in addition to its agreeable fla-

To Can Fruit and Vegetables. — ^Peaches 
should be skinned and cut in halves if clingstones, 
or quartered if freestone, and thrown into water to 
keep fresh. Put them in a can, adding half as 
much sugar as fruit, in alternate layers. Let stand 
until the sug-ar is dissolved, then put in a preserving 
kettle and let boil until the fruit is boiling-hot. At 
once fill the cans and seal tight. 

liiispberries, and such other small fruit, are done 
as follows: Pick and wash the fruit carefully, and 
to every pound of fruit add half a pound of sugar. 
Put in a vessel in alternate layers and let stand for 
one hour. Boil in preserving-kettle for ten min- 
utes, cjm whilst hot. No water need be used, as 
the fruit yields sufficient juice. 

Corn, peas, okra, etc. : Boil for half an hour, with 
just sufficient water to cover them ; can whilst hot. 
The corn, of course, should be cobbed before boiling. 

Tomatoes: Scald only enough to remove the 
skins, boil for half an hour in their own juice. Can 
boiling-hot. 

To seal hermetically, place the jars in a pan of 
Jiot water, which will expel the air, seal at once, and 
the fniit will keep an indefinite period. * 

Brandy Peaches. — Four j)ounds of rii)e i)eaches, 
two pounds of powdered loaf sugar. Put the fruit 
over the fire in cold water, simmer, but not boil, till 
tlie skins will rub off easily ; stone them, if liked.

QUINCB3 Pkeserved Whole. — ^Pare and put 
them into a saucepan, with the parings at the top, 
then fill it with hard water, cover it close, set it over 
a gentle fire till they turn reddish. Let them stand 
till cold, put them into a clear, thick syrup, boil 
them for a few minutes; set them on one side till 
quite cold, boil them again in the same manner. 
The next day boil them until they look clear. If 
the syrup is not thick enough, boil it more. When 
cold, put brandied paper over them. The quinces 
may be halved or quartered. 

QuixcE Marmalade. — To one gallon of quinces 
three pounds of good loaf sugar. Pare the quinces 
and cut them in lialves, scoop out the cores and the 
hard strip that unites the core with the string. Put 
the cores and some of the paripgs in a saucepan 
with about a qu^rt of water; put the halves of 
quinces in a steamer that fits the sauce|)an, boil them 
until the quinces are softened by the steam, then 
mash them with a wooden spoon in a dish and pour 
the water from the saucepan on them, which is now 
of a thick glutinous substance. Put them with the 
sugar in a stewpan or enamelled saucepan, and let 
them boil for about half an hour, keeping them well

the juice in a filtering-bag, weigh it^ and put it with 
three-quarters of its weight of st^r in a brass ket- 
tle. Do not forget to put in a piece of cinnamon. 
Cook the whole together until it has become a jelly. 
Take it from the fire, and tie up in pots when it is 
cold. 

Quinces for the Tea Table. — Bake ripe 
quinces thoroughly. When cold, strip off the skins, 
place them in a glass dish, and sprinkle with white 
sugar, and serve them with cream. They make a 
fine looking dish for the tea table, and a more lus- 
cious and inexpensive one than the same fhiit made 
into sweetmeats. Those who once taste the frait 
thus prepared will probably desire to store away a 
few bushels in the fall to use in the above manner. 

Quince and Apple Jelly. — ^Cut small and 
core an equal weight of tart apples and quinces. 
Put the quinces in a preserving-kettle, with water 
to cover them, and boil till soft ; add the apples, 
still keeping water to cover them, and boil till the

as you like, about two to six or eight dozen of the 
apples. Fill the preserving-pan, and cover the fruit 
with spring water. Boil them till they are in pulp, 
then pour them into a jelly-bag ; let them strain all 
night; do not squeeze them. To every pint of 
juice put one pound of white sugar. Put in the 
juice of the lemons you had l>efore pared,* but strain 
it through muslin. You may also put in about a 
teaspoonful of essence of lemon, let it boil for at 
least twenty minutes ; it will look redder than at 
first; skim it well all the time. Put it either in 
shapes or pots, and cover it the next day. It ought 
to be quite stiff and very clear. 

Apple Jam. — ^The apples, which should be ripe, 
and of the best eating sort, being ^ared and quar- 
teredy are put into a pan with just water to cover 
them, and boiled until they can be reduced to a 
mash. Then, for each pound of the pared apples, a 
pound of sifted sugar is added, being sprinkled over 
the boiling mixture. Boil and stir it well until re- 
duced to a jam ; then put it into pots. 

The above is the most simple way of making it ; 
but to have it of the best possible clearness, make a 
thick syrup with three pounds of sugar to each pint 
of water, and clarify it with an egg, as before directed. 
Then add one pint of this syrup for every three 
pounds of apples^ and boil the jam to a propei

little lemon-juice to keep them white; take them 
out after a short time and drain them, weigh and 
put them into a stewpan, with an equal quantity of 
sugar, a stick of cinnamon, and the juice of a lemon. 
Place the stewpan over a brisk fire and cover it. 
When the apples are pulped, stir the mixture until 
it becomes of a ))roper consistency, and put the mar-

has not been carefully separated from the butter- 
milk, has been improperly packed, or from any 
other cause threatens to turn rancid, should be 
immediately washed and kneaded in spring water, 
changing the water several times, then resalted with 
salt pounded as fine as possible, and sifled through 
a hair sieve. 

Butter making. — Strain away the milk in flat, 
stone jars nicely cleaned and scalded. Skim the 
cream off when it rises. In the summer season the 
craam should not be kept longer than twenty-four 
hours before it is churned. After churning take 
the butter up in a wooden bowl without any water 
at all, and let it set by over night, and in the morn- 
ing, while cool and pleasant, beat it well and season 
with salt to taste. After a day or two it should be 
beaten over again to get all the milk out of it (for 
this is the true secret of keeping butter well). 
Season it with a little more salt, and pack.

To PRESERVE Butter. — Take good, sweet, June 
butter, work the buttermilk carefully out; then add 
a handful of salt to a pound of butter ; pack a good 
layer of butter in your stone jar, then a layer of 
salt ; repeat until the jar is full ; then place a good 
weight on top, and stand in a good cool place ; cover 
with brine, to bear an egg. 

Curled Butter. — ^Tie a strong cloth by two of 
the corners to an iron hook in the wall ; make a 
knot with the other two ends so that a stick might 
pass through. Put the butter into the cloth ; twist 
it tightly over a dish, into which the butter will 
fall through the knot, so forming small and pretty 
slittle strings. The butter may then be garnished 
with parsley, if to serve with a cheese course ; or it 
may be sent to table plain for breakfast in an orna- 
mental dish. Squirted butter for garnishing hams, 
salads, eggs, etc., is made by forming a piece of 
stiff paper in the shape of a cornet, and squeezing 
the butter in fine strings &om the hole at the 
bottom. Scooped butter is made by dipping a 
teaspoon or scooper in warm water, and then 
scooping the butter quickly and thin. In warm 
weather, it would not be necessary to heat the 
6ix>on. 

Rancid Butter, boiled in water with a portion 
of charcoal (say a tenth part), will be entirely 
divested of its rancidity, and may be used for cook- 
ing purposes, although its fine flavor will not be 
restored for the table.

MAXUFACTURE OP l^INEAPPLE AND POTATO 
CHEESES. 

The Netherlanders supply the market with what 
is popularly known as "pineapple'^ cheese. Very 
excellent cheese it is, too — ^this Dutch pineapple — 
keeping in all climates capitally, and always com- 
manding ready sale at good prices. This is the 
Hollanders' formula for making Edam or pine- 
apple cheese. It is simple enough, and the Holland 
"pine-apples'' may just as easily be made in Ame- 
rica, wherever four or five cows are kept, as it is in 
the Netherlands. 

The fresh sweet milk is curdled with muriatic 
acid or spirits of salt, and the curd cut and chop}>ed 
and manipulated in the most thorough manner in 
order to expel every particle of whey. The curd 
is then soaked in a brine of sufficient strength to 
floatan egg for an hour. The brine is then worked 
out, and the curd subjected to a heavy pressure in 
iron moulds, that give the pineapple form to the 
cheese. After from four to five hours' pressing, the 
cheese is taken from the form and anointed with 
soft butter, having as much fine salt worked into it 
as it will hold. Thus finished up they set singly 
in rows on shelves in a cool, airy place, and with a 
month's curing are in a fit condition to send abroad, 
and will keep for years in any climate. 

The largest of these Dutch cheeses never exceed 
four and a half pounds weight, to make one of

^v'luch requires ^bout six gallons of milk. So at 
•my farm-house, where three or four cows only are 
kej)t, an Edam cheese may be made every day with- 
out interfering with other duties, and the aggregate 
for a year would make a very respectable increase 
of income. 

In Saxony the smaller farmers manufacture very 
palatable cheese from the milk of a single cow by 
the addition of potatoes. The potatoes are boiled 
until perfectly cooked, then mashed, and to four 
pounds of potatoes one quart of thick sour milk is 
added, with salt enough to season, and thd mass 
kneaded as thoroughly as bread dough. In four 
days it receives another vigorous kneading, and is 
divided into balls of three to five pounds weight, 
pressed with the hand as compact as possible into 
small baskets, and dried, in summer, in the shade ; 
in winter, by the fire or stove. When thoroughly 
dry, the cheese is put into tin cans, sealed up, and 
set by for use in a cool, dry place. 

Cheese Biscuit. — ^Two ounces of butter, two 
ounces of flour, two ounces of grated cheese, a little 
Cayenne, and salt. To be made into a thin paste 
and rolled out very thin, then cut in pieces four 
inches long and one inch broad, bake a very light 
brown, and send to table as hot as possible. 

Cheesecake.— Bruise one cottage cheese with 
one-eighth of a pound of butter, add four eggs 
and milk enough to render it the consistency of

thick gruel; sweeten to taste; add one-half a 
lemon and spice to your liking. Bake with bottom 
crust. 

Buttermilk Cheese. — Scald the buttermilk; 
then set it over the fire to boil ; skim the top, and 
put it in a jug to drain ; add a little salt, and it is 
i*eady for use. 

Potted Cheese. — This is a useful luncheon 
dish, and, being in a glass jar, it looks light and 
pretty on the table. One pound of cheese must be 
well beaten in a mortar, and to it must be added 
two ounces of liquid butter, one glass of sherry, 
and a very small quantity of Cayenne pepper, mace, 
and salt. All should be well beaten together and 
put into a pretty-shaped glass potting-jar, with a 
layer of butter at the top. It makes a delicious 
relish for bread or toast. 

Cheese Straws, No. 1. — Haifa pound of puff- 
paste, three ounces of Parmesan cheese, grated, a 
little Cayenne pepper, salt and black pepper, roll 
it very thin, cut it in narrow strips, bake in a 
moderate oven, and serve hot. 

2. Quarter of a pound of flour, and two_ ounces 
of butter worked through the flour with the fingers, 
and rubbed till quite smooth ; two ounces of grated 
cheese, the yelks of two eggs, and the white of one. 
Season to taste with Cayenne pepper and a small 
pinch of salt Mix all together, roll it out thin,

place it on a well-buttered tin pan ; cut into narrow 
strips about five inches long. Remove from the tin 
carefully, after baking ten minutes. 

3. Quarter of a pound of puff-paste, a quarter of 
an ounce of Parmesan (or any other good cheese) 
grated very fine, a little salt and Cayenne pepper 
mixed, sprinkle the cheese, salt and pepper over the 
paste, and roll it two or three times; cut it into 
narrow strips about five inches long. Bake them 
in a slow oven, and serve hot. 

Cream Cheese. — ^The cream cheese we make 
at home is much admired. We put a quart of 
cream into a clean jug, with half a teaspoonful of 
salt stirred in, and let it stand a day or two till 
thickish. Then we fold an ordinary grass cloth 
about six or eight times, and sprinkle it with salt, 
then lay it in a sieve about eight inches in diameter. 
The sides of the cloth should come up well over the 
sieve. Then pour in the cream, and sprinkle a 
little salt on it. Change the cloth as often as it 
becomes moist, and as the cheese dries press it with 
the cloth and sieve. In about a week or nine days 
it will be prime and fit to eat. The air alone 
suflSces to turn the cream into cheese. 

Another : Take about half a pint of cream, tie it 
up in a piece of thin muslin, and snspend it in a 
cool place. After five or six days take it out of 
the muslin, and put it between two plates, with 
a small weight on the upper one. This wilt

make it a good shape for the table, and also help 
to ripien the cheese, which will be fit to use in 
about eight days from the oommenceinent of tlie 
making. 

HOW TO COOK AND SERVE EGGS. 

When we inform our readers that in the wide 
and ever-extending circle of French cookery, no less 
than six hundred and eighty-five ways of preparing 
eggs are recognized, it will be obvious to them that 
our chief difficulty has been, in preparing this 
collection, what to choose, and what to avoid. Our 
principle has been to present to our readers the 
choicest, the most useful, and palatable varieties. 

Eggs, Plain Boiled. — ^This being beyond ques- 
tion the most popular way of serving eggs, we 
must commence by giving it in the approved French 
method. Get ready a saucepan of boiling water, 
plaae in it some fresh eggs, immediately remove 
the saucepan from the fire, put on the lid, and let 
the eggs remain exactly four minutes. Take them 
up, and serve them, well warmed, in a dish. The 
eggs, if so preferred, may be put into cold water 
over a quick fire, and when the water comes to a 
boil, they are done. 

Eggs sur le Plat. — Heat some butter upon a 
tin or pewter dish ; carefiilly break into it as many 
eggs as you think sulBcient; arranging them neatly; 
•easou with salt and pepper ; add a few teaspoonfuU

of good, I hick cream, and place the dish for six 
minutes over a clear fire, and serve directly. 

Egg-balls. — ^Take the yelks of six hard-boiled 
e^i^gs ; pound them in a mortar, together with a 
little salt, one de8sert8[KX)nful of flour, and a small 
quant ity of pepper. When a smooth, but stiff paste 
is formed, add as much raw yelk of egg as will 
serve to mix it of the consistency required. Make 
it into balls, and serve them ui)on buttered toast. 

Lait de Poule. — Beat until light the yelks of 
two fresh eggs, add two teaspoonfuls of powdered 
loaf sugar, and the same quantity of orange flower 
water. Stir quickly and add a teacupful of boiling 
water. Drink while hot. 

Eggs a L'Ardennaise. — Break the shells of 
one dozen eggs. Separate the yelks from the whites 
and keep each yelk by itself. Beat the whites to a 
froth; add to them a little salt, pepper and tliick 
cream. Pour the mixture into a well-butl^ed 
deep dish, and arrange the yelks upon the top. 
Put the dish into a gentle oven, and, when set. 
serve hot. 

Eggs a L'Aurore. — Boil some eggs until they 
are hard. Remove the shells; cut each egg in half 
and scoop out the yelks, put these into a mortar with 
some pepper, salt, savory herbs and cream. Beat 
all to a paste ; place some of it in each halved white 
of egg, and lay the remainder in a buttered dish. 
Arrange the staffed eggs on the top with the foroed

meat uppermost. Brown in a moderate oven, and 
serve hot. 

Bboiled Eggs. — Cut a large round of bread ; 
toast it on both sides, and butter it. Carefully 
break six eggs, and arrange them upon the toast ; 
sprinkle over them some salt and pepper, and 
slowly pass a red-hot shovel up and down over 
them until they are well set. Squeeze upon them 
the juice of an orange, and strew over a little 
grated nutmeg. Serve as quickly as possible. 
If preferred, the toasted bread may be dipped 
into some warmed cream, and some poached eggs 
placed upon it, and then glazed with a red-hot 
shovel. 

Minced Eggs. — Shell four or five hard-boiled 
eggs, and mince them ; but not very fine. Thicken 
a breakfastcupfiil of gravy or milk, with sufficient 
flour rolled in butter; add some savory herbs, 
chipped small; season with Cayenne or white 
pepper, a little nutmeg, and salt; simmer it for ten 
minutes, put in the eggs, shake it gently round and 
round over the fire for a few moments, and serve 
garnished with sippets of toast and small pieces of 
sliced lemon. Any particular flavor may be given 
to this dish, to suit the taste. 

Brown Eggs. — Hard boil some eggs, put them 
into cold water, shell them and slice them; lay 
them upon hot buttered toast, and season them 
aooording to taste. Strew fiied bread crumbs over

theui, then sprinkle them with catsap and brown 
them. 

Egg Dumplings. — Make a batter of a pint of 
milk, two well-beaten eggs, a teaspoonful of salt, 
and flour enough to make a batter as thick as for 
pound cake. Have a clean saucepan of boiling 
water ; let the water boil fast ; drop in the batter 
with a tablespoon. Four or five minutes will boil 
them. Take them with a skimmer on a dish ; put 
A bit of butter and pepper over them, and serve 
with boiled or cold meat. To serve sweet, put 
butter and grated nutmeg, with syrup or sugar 
over it. 

Humbled Eggs. — ^Very convenient for invalids, 
or, when required, a light dish for supper. Beat 
up three eggs with two ounces of fresh butter, or^ 
well- washed salt butter; add a teaspoonful of cream 
or new milk. Put all in a saucepan and keep stir- 
ring it over the fire for nearly .five minutes, unlil it 
rises up like souffle, when it should be immediately 
dished on buttered toast. 

Omelette Soupplee. — Put three tablespoonfuls 
of sugar in a bowl with four yelks of eggs, and 
mix them well, adding a few drops of essence. 
(Omelette soufflde is an erUrenUt and comes after 
the vegetables.) Then beat the whites, adding a 
pinch of salt, and mix with the rest, putting in 
tw^ tabfespoonfuls of the mixture with the whites 
«t first, and then adding the rest Stir gently

until well mixed, aucl serve in the dish that it in 
C50oked in. After putting it in the pan smooth 
with a knife, dust with powdered sugar and 
bake. The salt is added to the white of egg to 
prevent its curdling. The omelette is eookeil at 
310^ Fahrenheit. For puff-paste, 600^. It must 
be served at once, as it falls rapidly. Powder with 
sugar and serve. 

Omelette a la Creppe. — ^Put into a basin 
eight tablespoonfuls of flour; beat six eggs into it, 
with as much milk as will make it into a batter, 
with a pinch of salt. Bake till brown. 

Egg Cheesecakes. — ^Twelve eggs, boiled hard 
and rubbed through a sieve (while hot), with half a 
pound of butter ; then add half a pound of pounded 
loaf sugar, half a pound of currants, and a little 
nutmeg. Brandy may be added, which flavors them 
nicely ; or, if preferred, a few drops of essence of 
lemon or almonds. 

Egg Sandwiches. — Hard boil some very fresh 
eggs, and, when cold, cut them into moderately thin 
slices, and lay them between some bread and butter 
cut as thin as possible ; season them well with pep- 
per, salt, and nutmeg. For picnic parties, or when 
one is travelling, these sandwiches are far preferable 
to hard-boiled eggs au naturd. 

Preserving Eggs. — In order to keep well, eggs 
must be perfectly fresh when packed. Tak8 a stone 
pot which will hold three gallons; pack the eggji

closely, sharp end down. Salt one pint of un- 
slacked lime, and dissolve it in sufScient water to 
cover the eggs. When cold, pour it over tbem^ be- 
ing sure no eggs float. 

Egg Omelette. — Scald one pint of new milk ; 
into this stir the yelks of five eggs, and a table- 
epoonful each of sugar and flour. Beat tlie whites 
of the eggs till stiff, and add to the yelks ; beat all 
well together, and bake in a quick oven. 

Buttered Eggs. — ^Four eggs, well beaten ; three 
tablespoonfuls of cream or rich unskimmed milk, a 
little grated tongue or ham, pepper, salt, and thiee 
ounces of butter. Put all the ingredients, excepting 
the eggs, into a stewpan and heat; when quite hot, 
add the eggs, and stir while cooking till quite thick. 
Spread upon buttered toast, and serve hot. 

Bacon Omelette. — Either simply mince some 
cold boiled bacon, and mix it with eggs which have 
been spiced and well beaten ; or take some raw 
bacon, chop it well, toss it in a frying-pan till nicely 
browned, and then pour the beaten eggs upon it ; or, 
place the tossed bacon upon some eggs that you 
nave just poured into a frying-pan ; when set, fold 
the omelette, and serve with a tomato sauce in the 
dish. 

Kidney Omelette. — Remove all skin, fat, and 
sinew from a fresh kidney, whether sheep's or calf's. 
Cut it^mall, season it well, and fry it quickly in hot

pour in the eggs, and before they are r^ularly set 
place the kidney in the middle ; turn in the ends 
of the omelette and serve ; garnish with thin slices 
of lemon quartered. 

Omelette aux Croutons. — Beat the yelks of 
six and the whites of four eggs ; season with salt 
and spice accoi*ding to taste. Cut spme nice little 
pieces of bread no larger than dice ; fry them in 
butter till they are well browned, then tiirow them 
quickly into boiling gravy or milk, or sauce of any 
particular flavor; mix them with the beaten egg, 
and fry as an ordinary omelette.

BREAD, BISCUIT, CAKES AND YEAST. 

Bread. — Set your sponge over night with one- 
half pint of lukewarm water, one teacupful of 
yeast, and one pint of flour (measure before sifting). 
In the morning warm half a cup of milk (or water 
with a little butter in it), and stir into the sponge 
with one tablespoonful of lime-water, and one and 
one-half pint of flour. Knead into two loaves and 
put them in your pans to rise, they will bake in 
about half an hour. 

Rolls and Bread (Superior). — Sift three 
quarts of flour. Take two eggs, one teacupful and 
a half of liquid yeast, two pints of lukewarm water, 
one tablespoonful of brown sugar, one of salt, and 
four handfuls of flour taken from the measured 
flour. Beat the eggs very light, and make these 
ingredients into a smooth batter. After the batter 
is well beateij, divide the remaining flour into two 
equal parts, and put one part of the flour into a tin 
pan or bucket, pour in the batter, and cover it with 
the remainder of the flour. Set it in a moderately 
warm place, and, in an hour and a half, or when 
light, tttrn the whole out and work it well. It may 
require more flour in kneading it Work it quickly,

but not until it is cold, and set it to rise again, rub- 
bing a little lard over the top of the dough. In 
three or four hours it will be ready to knead over 
again, and, after it has risen a second time, it is 
ready for baking in a quick oven. If you wish 
rolls, work in a spoonful of lard during the last 
kneading, and mould the dough into small cakes. 
Do not keep the dough too warm, and it will be 
more flaky. If you wish a smaller loaf of bread, 
use only a pint and a half of water in making 
up the batter, but do not diminish the other ingre- 
dients. 

Bread Receipt. — Take three pints of warm 
water, one tablespoon ful of lard, one teacupful of 
warm yeast ; thicken with flour to form a dough. 
Let it stand to rise, then work into loaves. Let it 
rise fifteen or twenty minutes, then bake about 
three-quarters of an hour. 

Wheaten Bread. — One spoonful of hop yeast, 
two potatoes boiled, and one pint of water ; make 
a sponge, and when light, or sufficiently raised, mix 
hard and let rise, and when it is light again, mould 
it over, and bake while light. 

Another way. — Grate half a dozen potatoes, 
and add one quart of water ; put in one cup of hop 
yeast at night, and in the morning, when light, add 
three teaspoonfuls of sugar, and flour to form a 
dough. Let it rise; when light, put it in tAis; let 
It ri^ again, and bake for half an hour.

BREAD, BISCUrr, CAKBR AND YEAST. 311 

Potato Bread. — ^Take four or five good mealy 
potatoes, and after boiling, peel and mash well ; add 
a large spoonful of flour and enough hot water to 
make a thin batter; when cool enough, add a small 
quantity of good yeast and a spoonful of augar ; set 
to rise in a moderately warm place, say by the stove 
or fire-place ; it rises very quickly. When risen, 
take two large spoonfuls of it for a pint and a half 
of flour, a small spoonful of lard or butter, a half 
pint of. milk, and hot water enough to make into 
a stiff batter, (over night ;) beat well ; next morn- 
ing work it well into a smooth dough and make 
into rolls or loaves ; set in a warm place to rise 
again, and bake in a quick oven. Do not forget a 
teaspoonful of salt and one of yeast powders sifted 
in the dry flour that you work into the batter in the 
morning ; a tin bucket is best, with a tight cover, 
and a towel between it and bucket. If your flour 
is good, there is no better receipt than this; no hops 
are needed. 

Homemade Bread. — Save a gill of bread dough 
made with hop yeast, cover it tightly and place it 
in a cool room or cellar until baking day ; then 
make a sponge of it by adding warm water and 
flour, and a good teaspoonful of sugar. This should 
be done early in the morning. When the sponge 
is very light, mix the bread as usual with warm 
milk, or water, and a teaspoonful of soda or saler- 
atus, and when light, bake This always insures

light, sweet bread, and entirely does away with 
yeast making. Of course^ a piece of dough mnst 
be saved out each time. 

Premium Rye Bread. — One quart of Indian 
meal, one quart of rye meal, one quart of wheat 
flour, one teacup of yeast, one teaspoon of salt. 
Make a thick batter with warm milk ; pour into 
pans and let it rise. Bake until well done. 

Rice Bread. — Boil half a pound of rice in three 
pints of water till the whole becomes thick and 
pulpy. With this, and yeast, and six pounds of 
flour, make your dough. In this way, it is said, as 
much bread wall be made as if eight pounds of flour, 
without rice, had been used. 

Corn Bread. — One quart of sour milk, one 
tablespoonful of soda, one teaspoonful of salt, one 
cup of molasses or brown sugar, three large cups 
of corn meal, and three of flour. Mix well, and 
bake in a slow oven at least two hours. 

Brown Bread. — One quart of corn meal, wet 
thoroughly with boiling water ; then add one quart 
of lukewarm water, one quart of raw corn meal, 
one quart of Graham flour, one tablespoonful of 
salt, four tablespoonfuls of good hop yeast, one tea- 
cupful of molasses; mix thoroughly; when light, 
Imke two hours in a moderately heated oven.

spoonful of soda, oue of cream of tartar, and a little 
butter. 

Corn Meal Bread. — ^Beat two eggs very light 
and mix them with one pint of sour milk ; add a 
teaspoonful of soda, and stir in one pint of corn 
meal and one tablespoonful of melted butter. Beat 
it well, and bake in a quick oven. 

Graham Loaf. — ^Take one quart of warm water, 
one teacupful of good yeast, and one tablespoonful 
of salt. Put into a pan, make a stiff batter witli 
flour, which has been sifted, and keep it very warm 
until it is light ; then take flour, which has been 
Imlf sifted, to thicken it, knead it well, but do not 
let it get cold; let it rise again. Then work it 
down, and put in one teacupful of sugar and a piece 
of butter the size of an egg. Knead it half an hour, 
l>ut it in pans, and let it rise very light. Bake 
three-quarters of an hour in a moderate oven. 

Graham Biscuit. — ^Two pints of buttermilk, 
half a pound of butter or lard, one teaspoonful of 
finely pulverized soda in the flour ; flour of desired 
quantity. 

Graham Crackers. — To flour sufficient to 
make a batter add two pints of cold water, quarter 
of a pound of butter, quarter of a teaspoonful of 
soda ; mix as stiff as can be worked. Cut out, pick 
with a fork, bake in a moderately hot oven. These 
crackers, with a cup of §weet cream, make a very 
-light, wholesome meal for dyspeptic*.

'314 BREAD, BISCUIT, CAKES AND YEAfiT. 

Graham Bread. — Graham flour. The wheat 
must be of the best quality, and either run through 
a sinut-mill, or washed and dried before grinding, 
it should be ground rather coarser than (x>mmon 
flour, and used without bolting. It takes more 
wetting than fine flour. For every loaf allow three 
large tablespoonfuls of molasses, one quart of wet- 
ting, a teaspoonful . of salt, three teaspooufuls of 
brewer's yeast. Mix the yeast, molasses, and salt 
in the wetting, add a half teaspoonful of soda, and 
mix in as much coarse flour as can possibly be 
stirred in with a spoon. Now knead the bread 
briskly, until it cleaves from the hand. Put the 
loaves in the pan, and pat it in place and shape. 
If made with homemade yeast, sponge the bread, 
and add the molasses and other wetting after th6 
sponge rises. Knead until the dough cleaves from 
the hands; set it in a warm place until it rises. 
When light, knead it again as before, and put it into 
the pans to rise. Add no flour after the first mix- 
ing ; the dough will not be stifi* enough to form into 
loaves. Shape the loaves after they are in the pan 
with the hand. 

Italian Bread. — ^One pound of butter, one 
pound of powdered loaf sugar, one pound two ounces 
of flour, twelve ^gs, half a pound of citron and 
lemon-peel. Mix as for pound cake. If the mix- 
ture begins to curdle, which it is most likely to do 
from the quantity of eggs, add a little of the flour. 
When the ^ggi are bII uaod^ and it is light, stir in

the remainder of the flour lightly. Bake it in long 
narrow tins, either papered or buttered, first put in 
a layer of the mixture, and cover it with the peel, 
cut in large thin slices. Proceed in this way until 
it is three parts full, and bake it in a moderate oven. 

Potato Bread. — ^There are many ways in which 
jK)^ato bread may be made, the most generally prac- 
ticed being to add hot mashed potatoes with wheat 
flour ; but potato bread proper is prepared by mak- 
ing use of potato meal and mashed potatoes only, 
aditiug one-fifth the quantity of water, with yeast 
and salt as for ordinary bread. This compoHition 
also makes excellent crumpets. A little butter in- 
troduced, and milk used instead of water, is a ma- 
terial improvement to potato bread. 

Indian Corn Bread. — One cup of sour milk, 
one cup of sweet milk, half a cup of lard, half a cup 
of molasses, one cup of wheat flour, four cups of 
Indian meal, one teaspoonful of saleratus, one tea- 
spoonful of salt. Steam it three hours.

fresh butter, one pound of flour, quarter of a pound 
of finely pounded loaf sugar; work the butter into 
the sugar by degrees, then add the flour in small 
quantities. Knead it with the hand into either a 
ivjund or square tin about an inch thick. Prick all 
over with a fork, and mark neatly round the edges, 
and bake in rather a cool oven for half an hour.

meal, a pinch of salt, two tablespoonfiils of butter, 
and a quarter of a cup of cream, two eggs. Add 
milk till it is a thin batter. Bake in deep tin pans. 
Or: A pint of sifted meal, one egg, a teaspoon ful 
of soda^ and i^ heaped one of cream of tartar, a little 
salt, a bit of butter half the size of an egg, and the 
same of lard ; thin this with milk, so that it will 
pour quite freely. Bake just twenty miilutes. 

Genuine Scottish Shortbread. — Take two 
pounds fine flour, one pound fresh butter, half pound 
fine sifted sugar. Thoroughly knead these together 
without one drop of water (the prevailing mistake 
is to add more or less water), roll out the cake to 
half an inch in thickness, and place it over paper in 
a shallow tin, and fire slowly until of proper crisp- 
ness. It is usual to insert in upper surface a few 
caraway confections and small pieces of orange-peel. 
Good cake should be most brittle — Seotice, "short,'' 
— whence its name. 

Shortbread. — One pound of flour, half a pound 
of fresh butter, three ounces of powdered lump sugar. 
Thoroughly mix the flour and sugar. Place your 
butter in the middle of the pasteboard, and jule 
round it the mixed flour and sugar, which yon must 
gradually and thoroughly work into the butter. 
When you have worked it smooth, roll it out. Cut 
in the form you wish, pinch i*ound the edges, and 
put some caraway oomfits or citron on the top. Bake 
in a very slow oven.

Hints pok Making and Baking Sweet

the whites and yelks separated, and they should 
always be strained. Breaking the eggs tlius, the 
bad ones may be easily rejected without spoiling

the others, and so cause no waste. As eggs are 
used instead of yeast, they should be very tJior- 
oughly whisked; they are generally suflSciently 
beaten when thick enough to carry the drop that 
falls from the whisk. 

Loaf sugar should be well pounded^ then sifted 
through a fine sieve. 

Currants should be nicely washed, picked, dried 
in a cloth, and then carefully examined, that no 
pieces of grit or stone may be left amongst them. 
They should then be laid on a dish before the fire, 
to become thoroughly dry ; as, if added to the other 
damp ingredients, cakes will be liable to be heavy. 

Good butter should always be used in the manu- 
facture of cakes ; and if beaten to a cream, it saves 
much time and labor to warm, but not melt, it 
before beating. 

Less butter and e^s are required for cakes when 
yeast is mixed with the other ingredients. 

The heat of the oven is of great importance, 
especially for large cake^ If the heat be not 
tolerably fierce, the butter will not rise. If the oven 
is too quick, and there is any danger of the cake 
burning or catching, put a sheet of clean paper over 
the top. Newspaper, or paper that has been printed 
on, should never be used for this purpose. 

To know when a cake is suflSciently baked, plunge 
a clean knife into the middle of it; draw it quickly 
out, and if it looks in the least sticky, put the cake 
back, and close the oven door until the cake ib ione.

These pn^wtions allow for the cake being iced. 
If more sugar is preferred, the quantity must be the 
same as the butter; but less is used in this instance, 
that the cake may be light, and also to allow for the 
fruit, which would make it too sweet. Double the 
quantity of almonds may be used if required, as 
some persons prefer more. Warm a smooth pan, 
large enough for the mixture ; put in the butter, 
and reduce it to a fine cream, by working it about the 
pan with your hand. In summer the pan need not 
be warmed, as it can be reduced to a cream without ; 
but in winter keep the mixture as warm as possible, 
without oiling the butter. Add the sugar arid mix 
it well with butter, until it becomes white and feels 
light in the hand. Break in two or three eggs at a 
time, and work the mixture well, before any more 
is added. Continue doing this until they are all 
used and it becomes Kght ; then add the spirit, clu^

mnLs, peel, spice, and almonds, some or most of 
these being previously cut in thin slices, the peel 
having also been cut into small thin strips and bits. 
When these are incorporated, mix in the flour 
lifirhtly ; put it in a hoop with paper over the bottom 
and round the sides, and place on a baking-plate. 
Large cakes require three or four pieces of stifle 
paper round the sides ; and if the cake is very large, 
a pipe or funnel, made either of stiff paper or tin, 
and well buttered, should be put in tlie centre, and 
the mixture placed round it ; this is to allow the 
middle of the cake to be well baked, otherwise the 
edge would be burnt two ix three inches deep before 
it could be properly done. Place t^ tin plate con- 
taining the cake on another, tiie siirface of which 
is covered an inch or two thick with sawdust or fine 
ashes to protect the bottom. Bake it in an oven at 
a moderate heat. The time required to bake it will 
depend on the state of the oven and the size of the 
cake. A large cake in an oven of a proper heat will 
take from four to five hours. When the cake is cold, 
proceed to ice it. Wedding cakes have generally, 
fii-st, a coating on the top of almond icing ; when 
this is dry, the sides and top are covered with royal 
or white icing. Fix on any gum paste or other or- 
naments whilst it is wet ; and when dry, ornament it 
with piping, orange-blossoms, ribbon, etc. ; the sur- 
fece and sides are often covered with small knobs of 
white sugar candy whilst the icing is wet. Twelfth 
oakes are iced with white or colored icing, and

OOFrEE AKD ITS PREPABATIOlT. 

It is not our intention to go into detailed history 
of the cultivation of the coflfee plant, which is not 
likely to be of great interest to our readers. Prac- 
tically it is sufficient for us to know that coffee is 
largely cultivated in many of the tropical regions of 
the globe, as the West Indies and America, Arabia, 
Ceylon, India, Bourbon, Java, etc. The Arabian or 
Mocha bean is very small, round, and dark yellow 
in color; East Indian kinds are larger; and th^ 
Ceylon, Wesrt Indian and Brazilian kitids are of a 
bluish or greetiish-gray tint, and the largest in size. 
When ooflSje-berries are roasted, they sufibr some re- 
markable changes, losing considerably in weighty 
but incrttwing to nearly double their original size;

BEVERAOBEl. iSi 

during the roasting the aromfttic flavor is developed, 
but the exact nature of the changes undergone id 
liot clearly understood. It is remarkable that cofifee 
contains a peculiar substance called caffein, on which 
much of the use of coffee as a beverage depends. 

Roasted coffee when ground is much adulterated 
with chicory; this fraud is easily detected by drop- 
ping some of the suspected coffee in a wine^ass 
with cold water. If the coffee is pure, it swims on 
the surface, and scarcely colors the water ; if it con- 
tains diicory, the latter sinks to the bottom and 
Stains the water of a deep red tint. 

Coffee is a wholesome and nutritive beverage ; it 
diminishes the disporition to sleep, and hence it is 
used by those who require to keep awake for study 
or other purposes. Medicinally it is found, like tea, 
useful in some forms of headache, where there is 
not any determination of blood to the head ; and it 
is also especially useful ill some cases of spasmodic 
asthma, when tak^n strong. 

The making of good coffee is a very rare thing in 
this country. Most persons boil it, so making a de- 
coction instead of an infusion ; this effectually gets 
rid of the delicate and agreeable aromatic flavor, 
and leaves a comparatively tasteless beverage. The 
following particulars will be found worth attention ; 
never buy your coffee ground, but grind it yourself 
immediately before using it; keep your coffee-pot, 
whatever kind you may use, wiped clean and dry 
inside, a damp tea or cofifee-pot acquires a musty

flavor that spoils the best tea or coffee. The chei^ 
est^ and perhaps the best coffee-pots, are those made 
on the French plan, called cc^itiirea; if you have; 
not one of these, adopt the following plan : put 
your freshly-ground coffee into tlie coffee-pot, pre- 
viously made warm, and pour upon it water actually 
boiling, set the pot by the side of the fire for a few 
seconds, but do not let it boil up, then pour a cupful 
out and return it back again to the pot, in order to 
clear it ; having done this, let it stand on the hob or 
fender to settle, and, in less than five minutes, ^ 
transparent strong aromatic cup of coffee may be 
poured out. The proportions of coffee (which should 
not be too finely ground) recommended, are an ounce 
to a pint, or pint and a half of water. 

The milk used with coffee should always be boiled 
and used as hot as possible ; the boiling of milk 
imparts a peculiar and exceedingly pleasant flavor to 
the coffee. White sugar is recommended, as the 
treacle-like flavor of moist sugar quite overpowers 
the delicate aroma. 

Cafe au Lait. — ^The French are justly cele- 
brated for this breakfast coffee, which may be made 
as follows : Use an infusion, made as directed, or in 
a cafiti^re, only of doable the strength, and when 
clear, pour it into the breakfast cups, which have 
been previously half or three-quarters filled with 
boiling milk, sweetened with loaf sugar. 

Cafjb Noib.— The strong, clear, black infusion^

BEVERAGES. 383 

macTe as above, served in small cups, and drank 
with a large quantity of sugar, is the caf^ noir of 
the French. 

Having been great coffee drinkers in our time, 
we have tried nearly every machine for making 
coffee that has ever been invented. These contri- 
vances, though very numerous, may be arranged in 
two classes — ^such as boil the coffee or make a de- 
coction, and those that expose it to the action of 
boiling water, or form an infusion. In the first 
class is included the common pot, which is too well 
known to need description. The ground coffee is 
boiled in the water, and the liquid fined by pour- 
ing out a portion and returning it. As the flavor 
of coffee depends on a very volatile oil, which is 
entirely dissipated by boiling, it is evident that cof- 
fee preserving its delicate aroma cannot be prepared 
by this process. 

The full flavor of coffee can be extracted by in- 
fusion, as effected in those contrivances in which 
the boiling water is poured on the ground berries. 
Of these we have found none superior to the French 
cafeti^re, which has the advantage of being cheap, 
simple, not liable to get out of order, and easily 
cleaned and dried. After trying nearly every de- 
vice that has been promulgated, we have returned 
to our fii-st love, the cafetilre, and hardly think M^e 
shall again be seduced from our attachment to it. 
Above all, we caution our readers to abstain frodi 
all coffee-making contrivances which contain a

Btrainer made of linen, calico, or any v^tablct 
fabric, as these, being moistened day after day, and 
kept constantly wet, become mouldy, and impart a 
very bad taste to the beverage. 

In the absence of any other contrivance, coffee as 
good as ever was imbibed can be made in a lipped 
jug by the following directions : Pour some boiling 
water in your jug to heat it, throw this out, put in 
your ground coffee, pour on your boiling water, stir 
down the powder from the top with a spoon, cover 
over the jug with a folded napkin, and place on the 
hob for a few minutes ; then pour out steadily, and 
you will have as clear and bright a cup of coffee as 
ever was made. As for the kind of coffee to be 
recommended, we always prefer a mixture of one- 
third small pea-berried Mocha, with two-thirds 
plantation coffee. This gives flavor and body, and 
we always add an ounce of good ground chicory to 
every pound. Dear readers, try this mixture; make 
it strong — ^very strong — pour it into large breakfast 
cups, with an equal amount of boiling milk, sweeten 
with loaf sugar, and then you may laugh at those 
who say that good coffee is only to be drunk in 
France. 

Good Coffee. — Put a cupful of coffee into a 
coffee-pot, break in an egg, pour /ibout a quart of 
hot water on it, boil an hour,straiL through muslin, 
and serve up very hot. 

AsroTHSB method. — Never puzcIiaM <K)ffi«

ground, but always whole ; and, above all, desire 
the servant to be most careful that the coffee-pot 
be thoroughly clean and well dried, so that it may 
be quite free from all unpleasant smell of stale cof- 
fee, which will entirely spoil the flavor of the fresh. 
After having ground a sufficient quantity of berries 
to allow one tablespoonful for each person, the 
white and shell of one egg must be thoroughly 
stirred about and mixed in with the coflfee. After 
this, pour upon it as much boiling water as it is 
supposed will be required, and boil it up as quickly 
as possible. Pour out about a teacupful, and put it 
back again. Take it from the fire, and pour half a 
teacup of quite cold water into it, and let it stand 
five minutes by the fire (but do not let it boil 
again) before you transfer it to the coffee-pot it is 
to be sent up in. Be very careful not to shake it 
in doing this, as the egg-shell and coffee powder 
will have settled at the bottom, and the liquid ought 
to be perfectly clear, and of a dark golden brov\o 
color. 

Concentrated Coffee. — Procure one-half 
pound of the choicest roasted coffee berries you can 
command, let the same be ground under your own 
immediate eye, to prevent the opportunity of chi- 
cory or any other spurious drug being introduced 
among the genuine material. Submit the coffee to 
a clean saucepan, containing one quart of boiling 
water, stir it round twice or thrice with a suitably-

sized spoon, adding, at the same tinje, two pieces 
of fresh white ginger. Place the saucepan over a 
slow fire, and let it simmer until the quantity of 
liquor is reduced to one pint; then strain the latter 
off into a smaller saucepan, and allow the liquor to 
simmer gently, adding to it at intervals as much 
white sugar as will qualify the character of a thick 
consistent syrup, when it may l^e taken up, and 
when thoroughly cold poured into jars or bottles, 
stopped closely down for use. It will keep for any 
length of time in any climate. An individual, 
possessing the above confection, may command a 
cup of strong, genuine coffee at a minute's notice ; 
it is necessary only to introduce two or three tea- 
spoonfuls of the essence into a coffeecup, and fill 
with boiling water. 

FRUIT SYRUPS. 

Most of our readers are aware that there are two 
different classes of sugars, — the cane sugars, derived 
from the cane, the beet, etc., and the grape sugars, 
Q» fouud in the grape, in honey, and as prepared 
artificially from potatoes; the latter used princi- 
pally in the fabrication of wines. Both forms of 
sugar have much the same taste, and cannot be dis- 
tinguished readily in solution. Of the cane sugars, 
however, only half the quantity is required to pro- 
duce a given sweetening effect as of the other. It 
may not be known generally, however, that cane 
sugar by long boiling becomes changed into grape

BEVEBAGES. 387 

sugar, and thus loses a portion of its sweetening 
power. This takes place not only in the process of 
clariiying, but also in preparing fruits, syrups, and 
preserves. Should the syrups be thickened by boil- 
ing beyond a certain degree, the grape sugar pro- 
duced, being only about one-quarter as soluble as 
cane sugar, separates after a time in the form of 
white crystals, the comparative want of sweetness in 
which will be very evident to the taste. Mixed 
with water as a drink, twice as much will be required 
as if no change had occurred. This furnishes a use- 
ful hint to housekeepers, which has been acted on to 
great advantage, namely, to boil the fruit juice by 
itself for the proper time, and allow it to become 
lukewarm, adding the proper quantity of white 
sugar, which soon dissolves without further heating. 
The juice is preserved in this way as perfectly as if 
the sugar were boiled a long time with it, maintains 
its original sweetness without the formation of crys- 
tals, and a much less quantity will answer the pur- 
pose. The same theory is applicable in the prepa- 
ration of preserves as of syrups. 

It is to be regretted that fruit syrups are not more 
extensively used in this country, as the addition of 
a few tablespoonfuls of a good fruit syrup to a glass 
of iced water, or soda water, produces a refreshing 
summer beverage that is far more desirable for 
general use than the majority of the liquids em- 
ployed in this country. For the use of ladies and

half white and half red, one pound of I'aspberries, 
and one pound of cherries, without the stones. Mash 
the fruit, and let it stand in a warm place for three 
or four days, keeping it covered with a coarse cloth 
or piece of paper with holes pricked in it to keep 
out any dust or dirt. Filter the juice, add the sugar 
in powder, finish in the water-batH, and skim it. 
When cold, put it into bottles, fill them, and cork 
well. 

MoRELLO Cherry Syrup. — Take the stones out 
of the cherries, mash them, and press out the juice 
in an earthen i)an. Let it stand in a cool place for 
two days, then filter; add two pounds of sugar to 
one pint of juice, finish in the water-bath, or stir it 
well on the fire, and give it one or two boils. 

Mulberry Syrup. — One pint of juice, one 
pOubd twelve ounces of sugar. Press out the juice, 
and finish as cherry syrup. 

Gooseberry Syrup. — One pint of juice, one 
pound twelve ounces of sugar. To twelve pounds 
of ripd gooseberries add two pounds of cherries 
without stones, squeeze out the juice, and finish as 
otl lei's. 

Lemon Syrup. — One pint and a quarter of juice, 
two pounds of sugar. Let the juice stand in a cool

place to settle. When a thin skin is formed on the 
top pour it off and filter ; add the sugar, and finish 
in the water-bath. If the flavor of the peel is pre- 
ferred with it, grate off the yellow rind of the lem- 
ons and mix it with the juice to infuse, or rub it off 
on part of the sugar, and add it with the remainder 
when you finish it. 

Raspberry Vinegar Syrtjp. — One pint of 
juice, two pints of vinegar, four pounds and a half 
of sugar. Prepare the juice as before, adding the 
vinegar with it. Strain the juice and boil to the 
pearl. A very superior raspberry vinegar is made 
by taking three pounds of raspberries, two pints of 
vinegar, and three pounds of sugar. Put the rasp- 
berries into the vinegar without mashing them, cover 
the pan close, and let it remain in a cellar for seven 
or eight days ; then filter the infusion, add the sugar 
in powder, and finish in the water-bath. This is 
superior to the first, as the beautiful aroma of the 
fruit is not lost in the boiling. 

Sour Orange Syrup. — ^Peel the oranges care- 
fully, then squeeze the juice and strain it, so as to 
extract the seed and white fibrous substances, which 
are very bitter. Add one pound of loaf sugar to 
one pint of juice, and boil it in a preserving kettle. 
Stir frequently, and skim well. Boil until it is a 
rich syrup. When nearly cold, bottle, cork, and 
seal. 

Syrup op Cloves. — Put a quarter of a pound

of cloves to a quart of boiling w^er, cover close, set 
it over a fire, and boil gently half an hour ; then 
drain and add to a pint of the liquor two pounds of 
loaf sugar, clear it with the whites of two eggs, 
beaten up with cold water, and let it simmer till 
it is strong syrup. Preserve it in phials, close 
corked. 

Orange Syrup. — Select ripe and thin-skinned 
fruit. Squeeze the juice through a sieve, and to 
every pint add one pound and a half of loaf sugar. 
Boil it slowly, and skim as long as the scum rises ; 
then take it oflF, let it grow cold, and bottle it. Two 
tablespoonfuls of this syrup mixed with njelted but- 
ter make a nice sauce for plum or batter puddings. 
Three tablespoonfuls of it in a glass of ice water 
make a delicious beverage. 

Lemonades. — ^Lemons furnish two important 
products for the formation of beverages, an acid 
juice, and an aromatic stomachic oil, contained in 
the rind. Lemon juice is a slightly turbid, very 
sour liquid, having a pleasant flavor when diluted. 
It contains a considerable quantity of gummy mu- 
cilage, which causes it to become mouldy on expo- 
sure to the air. It is capable of furnishing a large 
number of acidulated drinks, which are exceedingly 
useful in allaying thirst, and are most valuable for 
their anti-scorbutic properties. 

In making any kind of lemonade, the proportions 
given need not be adhered to, but the quantities

BEVEBAGES. 391 

ordered may be increased or lessened to suit the 
taste. 

For a quart of lemonade, take six lemons and a 
quarter of a pound of sugar ; rub off part of the yel- 
low rind of the lemons on to the sugar, squeeze the 
juice on to the latter, and pour on the water boiling 
hot; mix the whole, and run through a flannel 
jelly-bag. 

Lemons are not always to be procured, especially 
on a journey, and we have, therefore, much pleasure 
in drawing attention to the following useful direc- 
tions for making portable lemonade : — 

Excellent Portable Lemonade.— Rasp with 
a quarter of a pound of sugar, the rind of a fine 
juicy lemon ; reduce the sugar to powder, and pour 
on it the strained juice of the fruit ; press the mix- 
ture into a jar, and when wanted for use dissolve a 
tablespoonful of it in a glass of water ; it will keep 
a considerable time. If too sweet for the taste of 
the drinker, a very small portion of citric acid may 
be added when it is taken. 

Mock Lemonade. — ^A cheap substitute for 
lemonade may be made as follows : Tartaric acid, a 
quarter of an ounce; sugar, six ounces; essence of 
lemon, dropped on the sugar, about four or five 
drops ; boiling water, two pints. This, allowed to 
stand till cold, makes a wholesome, cooling, summer 
beverage, economical in its cost, but the flavor Is not 
equal to that prepared from lemon juice.

Superior Lemon a la Soyer. — ^Take the peel 
of six lemons, free from pith, cut it up in small 
pieces, and put it with two cloves into a bottle con- 
taining half a pint of hot water, place the bottle in 
a stewpan with boiling water, and let it stand by the 
side of a fire for one or two hours, taking care it 
does not boil ; then take half a pint of lemon juice, 
half a pint of syrup, if none, use plain syrup, or 
sugar, in like proportion, adding a few drops of 
orange flower water; add the infusion of the rind, 
which has been previously made, and allowed to be- 
come cold, stir well together, and add two quarts of 
cold water. 

Lemonade a la Soyer. — ^Put a quart of water 
in a stewpan to boil, into which put two moist dried 
figs, each split in two ; let it boil a quarter of an 
hour, then have ready the peel of a lemon, taken off 
rather thickly, and the half of the lemon cut in thin 
slices ; throw them into the stewpan, and boil two 
minutes longer, then pour it into a jug, which cover 
closely with paper until cold, then pass it through 
a sieve, add a teaspoonful of honey, and it is ready 
for use. 

Orangeade a la Soyer. — Proceed as for 
lemonade, but using the whole of the orange, a little 
of the peel included, sweetening with sugar-candy, 
and adding a teaspoonful of arrowroot, mixed with 
a little cold water, which pour into the boiling liquid 
at the same time you put in the orange. The ar- 
rowroot makes it very delicate.

BEVEBAGEEL 393 

Barley Lemonade. — Pat a quarter of a pound 
of sugar into a small stewpan, with half a pint of 
water, which boil about ten minutes, or until form- 
ing a thickish syrup ; then add the rind of a fresh 
lemon and the pulp of two ; let it boil two minutes 
longer, when add two quarts of barley-water, made 
without sugar and lemon ; boil five minutes longer, 
pass it through a hair sieve into a jug, which cover 
with pajx^r, making a hole in the centre to let the 
heat tlirough ; when cold it is ready for use; if put 
<io\d into a bottle, and well corked down, it would 
keep good several days. 

Barley Orangeade. — Barley orangeade is 
made in the same manner, substituting the rind and 
juict of oranges; the juice of a lemon, in addition, 
is an improvement. 

Another Mock Lemonade. — ^A mock lemon- 
ade of superior flavor may be made by using the 
acid prepared from lemons, citric acid, according to 
the following receipt : Citric acid, a quarter of an 
ounce ; essence of lemon, ten to twenty drops ; syrup, 
half a pint; boiling water, as much as may be re- 
quired. This preparation is expensive, and is not 
equal to lemonade from fresh lemons, which should 
always be preferred when they can be obtained. 

Plain Orangeade. — ^Orangeade should be made 
in precisely a similar manner to lemonade, using 
oranges instead of lemons ; but as there is less acid 
in this fruit, a much larger proportion of juice is

required, and, however prepared, this beverage is 
rather insipid, and is inferior to the following : — 

Orange Lemonade. — Take three oranges, one 
large lemon, and two or three ounces of sugar ; rub 
off some of the peel on to the sugar, squeeze on the 
juice, and pour on two pints of boiling water ; mix 
the whole and strain. 

Orangeade. — ^Take half a pound of ground loaf 
sugj^r, one and a half ounce of carbonate of soda ; 
mix well in sixteen portions, and put in blue paper ; 
one ounce of tartaric acid, in white paper. Dissolve 
the contents of a blue paper in half a pint of water, 
and the acid in a quarter of a pint of water, to which 
add orange juice; mix them together and drink. 
Two or three spoonfuls of the syrup of marmalade 
may be used instead of orange juice, in which case 
it must be dissolved in the first glass. 

FRUIT VINEGARS. 

During the summer few beverages are more 
refreshing than fruit vinegars, mixed with iced or 
cold spring water. The following directions are 
recomended as having been tried and found very 
successful : 

Strawberry Vinegar. — Take the stalks from 
the fruit, which should be a highly flavored sort, 
quite ripe, fresh from the beds, and gathered in dry 
weather ; weigh and put it into large glass jars, or 
wide-necked bottles, and to each pound pour about

BflVERAGES. 396 

a pint and a half of fine pale white wine vinegar, 
which will answer the purpose better than the en- 
tirely colorless kind, sold under the name of distilled 
vinegar, but which is the pyroligneous acid greatly 
diluted. Tie a thick paper over them, and let the 
strawberries remain from three to four days ; then 
pour off the vinegar and empty them into a jelly- 
bag, or suspend them in a cloth that all the liquid 
' may drop from them without pressure ; take an 
equal weight of fresh fruit, pour the vinegar upon 
it, and three days afterwards repeat the same pro- 
cess, diminishing a little the proportion of straw- 
berries, of which the flavor ought ultimately to 
overpower the vinegar. In three days drain off 
the liquid very closely, and after having strained it 
through a linen or a flannel bag, weigh it, and mix 
with it an equal quantity of highly-refined sugar, 
roughly powdered ; when this is nearly dissolved, 
stir the syrup over a very clear fire until it has 
boiled five minutes, and skim it thoroughly ; pour 
it into a delicately clean stone pitcher, or into large 
china jugs, throw a folded cloth over and let it 
remain until the morrow; put it into pint or half 
pint bottles, and cork them tightly with new velvet 
corks, for if these be pressed in tightly at first, the 
bottles would be liable to burst; in four or five days 
they may be closely corked, and stored in a dry and 
cool place. 

Damp destroys the color and injures the flavor 
of these fine fruit vifiegars, of which a spoonful or

two in a glass of water affords so agreeable a sum- 
mer beverage, and one which, in many cases of 
illness, is so acceptable to invalids. 

Where there is a garden the fruit may be thrown 
into the vinegar as it ripens, within an interval of 
forty-eight hours, instead of being all put to infuse 
at once, and it must then remain a proportionate 
time ; one or two days in addition to that specified 
will make no difference to the preparation. The 
enamelled stewpans are the best possible vessels to 
boil it in, but it may be simmered in a stone jar set 
into a pan of boiling water, when there is nothing 
more appropriate at hand ; though the syrup does 
not usually keep so well when this last method is 
adopted. 

Raspberry Vinegar. — Put two pounds of 
raspberries into a jar, and pour on them a quart of 
best white wine vinegar, and let all stand twenty- 
four hoiu*s ; then add two pounds more of rasp- 
berrries, and let all stand twenty-four hours more ; 
then strain the pure vinegar through a sieve, and 
to every pint add one pound of sugar, and then 
boil it up twenty minutes; when cold, bottle it 
for use. It will keep two years; but seal each 
bottle. 

Gooseberry Vinegar. — Take the ripest goose- 
berries you can get ; put tliem into a very clean tub, 
and crush them with your hands. To every i>eck 
of gooseberries put two gallons of water; mix them

BEVERAGES. 397 

well together, and let them work for three weeks, 
taking care to stir them up three or four times a 
day. At the expiration of that time, strain the 
liquor through a hair sieve, and to every gallon of 
it, add one pound of moist sugar, one pound of 
treacle, and a spoonful of fresh yeast ; let it work 
for four days in the same tub, which should be 
well washed. Turn it into iron-hooped barrels, 
and let it stand twelve months ; then draw it into 
bottles for use. This far exceeds any white wine 
vinegar. 

Norwegian Raspberry Vinegar. — Take 
four pounds of raspberries, pour over them half a 
pint of vinegar, place it in an earthen jar, and 
cover it securely, so that no air can enter, and place 
it in a sunny window twelve hours ; take it in at 
night, and place it out again in the sun the next 
day for another twelve hours. Then place in a 
flannel bag, till the juice has run through without 
pressure. Then, for every pound of juice take a 
pound of loaf sugar, and boil it for a quarter of an 
hour, or till no scum arises; then put it into small 
bottles and well cork it. 

Mixed Fruit Vinegars. — Raspberries and 
strawberries mixed will make a vinegar of very 
pleasant flavor. 

Strawberry Drink. — Put to a pint of water 
a pound of strawl)erries, which you are to bruise 
or mash in the water, then put in a quarter of %

pound or five- ounces of sugar, and squeeze into it 
the juice of a lemon, and suffer it to cool before 
yon drink it. If the lemon be full, it will serve 
two pints. 

Lemon Water is also a delightful drink. Put 
two slices of lemon, thinly peeled, into a teapot a 
little bit of the peel and a large spoonful of capil- 
laire ; pour in a pint of boiling water, and stop it 
close two hours. 

Tomato Wine. — Take small ripe tomatoes, pick 
off the stems and wash them, mash and strain 
through a linen bag; let it stand till the pulp is 
settled, then measure. Add two pounds and a half 
or three pounds of loaf sugar to a gallon of juice! 
Put into a cask, and let it ferment, then bottle and 
pack away for use. If two gallons of water are 
added to five gallons of juice, it will make pretty 
good wine, but not as fine as if the adulteration is 
not made. 

Muscadine Wine. — Get the grapes full ripe, 
wash, and pound with a pestle, being careful not to 
break the seeds, as it will make the wine bitter. 
Measure them after they are pounded, and to every 
gallon add a gallon of cistern water. Let it stand 
a week, then measure the clear juice; add two 
pounds and a half or three pounds of loaf sugar 
to each gallon. Let it' stand till fermentation 
ceases, then bottle for use. This is excellent — 
try it.

ErirBAHiX Wjxe. — Take the juice from the 
s^tilks of the garden rhubarb, one gallon, to it add 
one gaHon o.^*\vat^r in which seven pounds of sugar 
has been dis«H;lvnl; put the mixture into a cask 
with the bnpg-bole open, and let it forment ; keep 
the cask full by adding sweetened water, so that it 
may purge itself. When it is sufficiently fermented, 
put in the bung. To give it a slight "bouquet 
flavor," three ounces of orris root, well pounded, 
is added to each barrel. Fine with isinglass before 
bottling. Four ounces of isinglass dissolved in a 
pint or more of wine, is sufficient for a barrel of 
wine. 

GixcffiR Wine. — Take four gallons of water and 
seven pounds of sugar; boil them half an hour, 
skimming it all the time; when the liquor is cold, 
squeeze in the juice of two lemons; then boil the 
peels, with two ounces of white ginger, in three 
pints of water, one hour ; Avhen cold, put it all to- 
gether into the cask with one gill of finings and 
three pounds of Malaga raisins ; then close it up, 
let it stind two months, then bottle it off. N.B. — 
A lump of unslacked lime put into your cask will 
keep wine from turning sour. 

Lemon AVixe. — Mix well together the rind of 
six and the juice of eighteen lemons, one gallon of 
whisky, six quarts of cold water, three pounds of 
loaf sugar, a stick of cinnamon, th»"ee dozen cloves, 
two ounc^ of bitter almonds^ and a quarter of a

pound of burnt sugar; when the sugar is well dis- 
solved, add three quarts of boiling new milk. Let 
it stand for two hours ; then strain through a flan- 
nel bag until quite clear. This quantity will fill 
eighteen bottles. 

Imperial. — Take half an ounce of cream of 
tartar, three ounces of fresh orange or lemon-peel, 
four ounces of lump sugar, and three pints of 
boiling water. Mix together; cover the vessel 
till cold, then pour off the clear part for use. 
This is a very agreeable drink for hot weather, or 
in fever. 

Imperial Pop. — Take three ounces of cream of 
tartar, one ounce of ginger, one and a half pound 
of white sugar, the juice of a lemon, and one gal- 
lon of water. Work it with yeast, and bottle it as 
ginger beer, which it resembles, except as being 
more acid in flavor, and more cooling in its medical 
properties. 

Capillaire. — Take one pound of loaf sugar, 
quarter of a pound of moist sugar, one egg well 
beaten, one pint of water. Simmer it one hour, 
skim it while boiling, let it get cold, then again 
boil and skim, and add one ounce of orange 
flower water and two tablespoonfuls of brandy. 
Strain through a jelly-bag, and bottle for use. 
A spoonful in a tumbler of water makes a pleasant 
beverage.

two ounces of best ginger (bruised), two ounces of 
cream of tartar, or else a lemon, sliced. Stir them 
up until the sugar is dissolved, let it rest until about 
as warm as new milk, then add two tablespoonfuls 
of good yejist, poured on to a bit of bread j)ut to 
float on it. Cover the whole over with a cloth, and 
suffer it to remain undisturbed twenty-four hours; 
then strain it and put it into bottles, observing not 
to put more in than will occupy three-quarters 
full. Cork the bottles well, and tie the corks, 
and in two days, in warm weather, it will be fit to 
drink. If not to be consume<l until a week or a

Watermelon Sherbet — A Bengal Receipt — 
Let the melon be cut in half, and the inside of the 
fruit be worked up and mashed with a spoon till it 
assumes the consLstency of a thick pulp. Introduce 
into this as much pounded white candy or sugar as 
may suit your taste, a wineglassful of fresh rose

Beef-Tea. — Take one and a half pound of the 
best steak, cut it into very small pieces, and put 
them into an earthenware jar with enough cold 
water to cover the meat ; tie the top of the jar on, 
and put it into a saucepan full of hot water; place 
the saucepan on the fire, and allow it to boil for 
three hours, by which time all the goodness of the 
meat will be extracted. This is the pure essence 
of beef. 

LiEBio's Soup. — Mix one tablespoonful of 
wheaten flour with one tablespoonful of freshly- 
ground malt flour, and add seven and a quarter 
grains of the bi-carbonate of potash. Rub this 
mixture well in a basin with two tablespoonfuls of 
water, and gra<lually add ten tablespoonfuls of new 
milk, stirring till all is well blended. Then simmer 
this mixture over a gentle fire until it begins to 
thicken. Imme<liately when it begins to thicken, 
remove the saucepan from the fire and stir the soup 
briskly until it becomes flnid. Now place the 
saucepan again over the fire, and let the soup boil 
gently for five minutes. Then strain it through a

ten minutes, and before taking it from the fire, add 
milk, with a little loaf sugar, and a few grains of salt. 

Oatmeal Poeridge is made by boiling oatmeal 
and water in such proportions that a thick mixture 
is obtained, which, on cooling, becomes nearly solid. 
The coarse Scotch oatmeal is far superior for these 
purposes. The most approved method of making 
porridge is to strew oatmeal with one hand into a 
vessel of boiling water (to which salt has been 
previously added), so gradually that it does not 
become lumpy, stirring the mixture at the same 
time with the other hand. After the requisite 
quantity has been stirred in — namely, about two 
large handfuls of coarse oatmeal to a quart of boiling 
water — ^the whole should be allowed to stand by the 
side of the fire, so as to simmer gently for twenty 
or thirty minutes. During this time it thickens 
considerably. As thus prepared, it is usually eaten 
with the addition of milk. 

Milk and Oatmeal Gruel. — This is a very 
nutritious food, but its effect should be watched, as 
it may not suit all cases. To prepare it, take a 
tablespoonful of the finest oatmeal and mix sipoothly 
with about a quarter of a pint of cold water, while

three-quarters of a pint of new milk is simmered 
Mix the warm milk gradually with the oatmeal and 
water. Then pour all into the saucepan, and boil 
it gently for ten minutes — stirring it well. Add a 
little loaf sugar and a few grains of salt. 

Panada op Fine Flour. — Rub smoothly one 
tablespoonful of the finest biscuit-flour with a 
quarter of xi pint of cold water in a basin. Simmer 
three-quarters of a pint of new milk with two or 
three lumps of sugar in it. Mix gradually the 
milk with the flour and water. Put it into the 
saucepan, and let it simmer gently for twenty 
minutes, stirring it well to prevent burning. This 
is a good food, and will generally be found to keep 
the bowels regular. 

Chicken Panada. — Skin a fowl; cut it in 
pieces, leaving the breast whole ; boil it in three 
pints of water till perfectly tender, pick off the meat, 
and pound it finely in a mortar, and mix it with 
the liquor it was boiled in ; rub it through a sieve, 
and season it with salt. 

Baked Crumbs of Bread. — Crumb some 
bread on a plate, put it a little distance from the 
fire to dry; when dry, rub the crumbs in a mortar, 
and reduce them to a fine powder ; then pass them 
through a sieve. Having done which, put the 
crumbs of bread into a slow oven to bake until they 
1x5 of a light fawn color. A small quantity of this 
baked crumb of bread must be made into food, in

the same way as gruel is made, and should then be 
slightly sweetened with lump sugar. 

Bread Panada. — Soak a few thin slices of stale, 
light, and well-baked bread in liot water, so as to 
form a pulp of suitable coasistence. Simmer it 
gently, with some little addition of water from time 
to time as it thickens; then add two or three table- 
spoonfuls of warm milk, a little loaf sugar, and a 
few grains of salt. The objection to this bread-pap 
as commonly used, is, that nurses are sometimes apt 
to make it too thick. 

FARINACEOUS FOODS ^VITH MILK. 

BouiLLiE OF Baked Flour. — Bake in a slow 
oven two ounces of flour until it is lightly colored. 
Take one tablespoonful and mix it smoothly with a 
quarter of a pint of cold water in a basin, while 
three-quarters of a pint of new milk is simmering. 
Mix gradually the hot milk with the baked flour 
and water; then pour into a saucepan, and simmer 
for ten minutes, stirring it so as to prevent any burn- 
ing. Sweeten it moderately with loaf sugar, and 
add a few grains of salt. 

BouiLLiE OF Boiled Flour. — Instead of baked 
flour, boileil flour may be used. It is prepared as 
follows: Tie up a pound of flour tightly in a linen 
cloth, and boil it for five hours. Peel off the outer 
rind. A tablespoonful of the inside must be finely 
grated, and used for bouillie, in the following man

ner : Take of the grated boiled flour one table- 
8{)oonful, and mix smoothly with a little water in a 
basin. Then pour upon it, gradually, one pint of 
milk that has simmered, and mix all well together. 
Pour into a saucepan and boil gently for ten minutes, 
or rather longer. Add a few grains of salt and 
sweeten with loaf sugar. 

Glycerin and Yelk of Egg. — The Phila- 
ielphia Jouimxd of Pharmacy has made known a 
formula for a preparation which is likely to prove 
valuable for external use. Four parts, by weight, 
of yelk of egg are to be rubbed in a mortar with 
five parts of glycerin. The compound has the 
consistence of honey, and is unctuous like fatty 
substances, over which it has the advantage of be- 
ing easily removed by water. It is unalterable, a 
s[>cciraen having laid exposed to the air for three 
years unchanged. Applied to the skin, it forms a 
varnish which effectually prevents the action of air. 
These properties render it serviceable for broken 
surfaces of all kinds, particularly erysi|>elas and 
cutaneous affections, of which it allays the itching. 

Wine Whey. — ^Boil a pint of new milk, add to 
it a glass or two of white wine, put it on the fire 
until it just boils again, then set it aside until the 
curd settles, pour off the clean whey ; sweeten to 
the taste. Cider is as good as wine to curdlei if it 
is good apple cider.

of arrowroot ; when the milk boils, stir in the arrow- 
root ; continue to stir until it is cooked, which will 
be in five or ten minutes ; remove from the fire, 
sweeten and flavor to the taste. 

Port Wine Jelly. — ^A pint of port wine, one 
ounce and a half of isinglass, three-quarters of an 
ounce of gum-arabic, four ounces and a half of 
powdered loaf sugar; stand it on the hob until dis- 
solved ; when cold it is fit for use. 

Orange Jelly. — Grate the rind of two oranges 
and two lemons, squeeze the juice of three of each 
and strain, and add the juice of a quarter of a 
pound of lump sugar and a quarter of a pint of 
water, and boil till it almost candies. Have ready 
a quart of isinglass jelly made with two ounces ; 
put to it the syrup and boil it once up ; strain off 
the jelly, and let it stand to settle .before it is put 
into the mould. 

Porter Jelly. — Half an ounce of isinglass to 
a quart of porter; put into the oven till dissolved ; 
strain and sweeten to your taste. When cold it 
will jelly. 

Sago Jelly. — A teacupful of sago, boiled in 
three pints and a half of water till ready. When

if preferred. 

Gelatine. — This is prepared for jellies by soak- 
ing over night in very little water; allow one ounce 
for each quart of jelly. If the isinglass is not pure, 
it must be clarified. Mix, in half a pint of water, 
a teaspoonful of the white of egg and a little lemon- 
juice; beat well, and stir it into two ounces isin- 
glass, which is dissolved in half a pint of water ; 
heat these together gradually, constantly stirring; 
remove all the scum, and pass it through a flannel 
jelly-bag. 

Jelly from Gelatine. — One ounce and a half 
of gelatine put over night into a pint of cold water, 
with the rinds and juice of three lemons. Next 
morning add a pint of boiling water, half a pint 
of sherry, the whites and shells of three eggs, and 
sweeten to your taste. Boil the whole ten minutes, 
and strain through a jelly-bag. This will make a 
quart of jelly. Be sure not to stir the mixture after 
it is placed on the fire. It is excellent.

MISCELLANEOUS. 

A Bill op Fare. — Put the soup first ; always 
eat the melon •immediately after ; then the fish ; then 
butcher's meat — l)eef, next mutton, next veal and 
lamb; then poultry, and last of all game. A roasted 
fish is served after the roast beef. Vegetables au 
8ucr6 are served after the other vegetables. Cheese 
is served before dessert. Tin-lined utensils for the 
kitchen are preferable to porcelain, because porce- 
lain cracks so easily. Copper is the best, if kept 
perfectly clean. For boiling milk, block-tin is the 
best. Always use a stone mortar, not a wooden one, 
and have a sharp-pointed knife for boning meat or 
fish. 

Coloring for Gravies and Ragouts. — ^Take 
four ounces of sugar (moist), and set it over the fire 
in a clean stewpan or earthen pipkin. When the 
sugar is melted and looks frothy, raise it higher 
from the fire, that it may not burn ; keep stirring 
it all the time till it is a fine brown ; pour in some 
red wine, taking care it does not boil over, add a 
little salt, lemon, mace, and a few cloves ; boil all 
up gently for ten minutes, and pour it into a basiu«

move all skin, sinew, etc., and either cut it small or 
pound it to a paste in a mortar, together with a 
proper proportion of spices and salt ; then either toss

b^ins to brown, and pour beaten eggs upon it, or 
beat it up with the eggs, or spread it upon them 
after they have begun to set in the pan. In any 
case, serve hot, with or without a sauce, but gar-' 
nished with crisp herbs in branches, or pickles, or 
sliced lemon. The right proportion is one table- 
spoonful of meat to four ^gs. A little milk, gravy, 
water, or white wine, may be advantageously added 
to the ^gs while they are being beaten.

then take it off, and stir into it a quarter of a poand 
of fresh butter, mixed with a small tablespoonfnl of 
flour. Then let it again come to boil. Have ready 
two deep plates with half a dozen slices of toast in 
each. Pour the milk over them iiot, and keep them 
covered till they go to table. Milk toast is gen«:ally 
eaten at break&st. The warming of the bread^gradu* 
ally through on both sides is a very great improve^ 
ment upon the quality of the toast. All kinds of 
toast must be done the same way ; but if to be served 
under a bird^ ^SS^f o^ kidneys, it requires to be 
toasted drier. Dry toast should not be made imtii 
quite ready to serve; when done, place it in a toast 
rack, or upon its edges, one piece resting against an- 
other. Any kind of toast that has been made half 
an hour is not worth eating. 

Breakfast Dish. — ^Two kidneys, one table- 
spoonful of flour, pepper and salt, half a teaspoon- 
ful of each, one tablespoonftil of walnut catsup or 
walnut pickle juice, two tablespoonfuls of gravy, one 
round of buttered toast, half a glass of claret. Skin 
and cut the kidneys into fine, thin slices, and shake 
the flour well over them ; place all the other ingre- 
dients, except the toast, in a saucepan, and let it boil 
gently for five minutes. Place it at the side of the 
fire till it ceases boiling, add the kidneys, and let it 
dtew gently for ten minutes, but be sure it does not 
boil. Have the toast ready in a hot dish, pour it 00

Boil three eggs for six minutes, take the yelks, and 
pound them in a mortar, add the flour and the yelk 
of the raw egg, beat all together till quite smooth^ 
then roll the mixture into little balls, and throw 
them into boiling water for two minutes just before 
the dish is served, and strew them over the head. 

Good Meat Cake. — Mince the lean of cold 
lamb or veal very finely ; soak a large slice of bread 
in boiling milk ;. mash it, and mix it with the minced 
meat ; also a beaten egg, some boiled chopped pars- 
ley and thyme, a little grated lemon peel, pepper 
and salt. Make it into small, flat cakes, and fiy 
them in butter or lard. Serve them up dry, or 
with good gravy, 

Superior Meat Pies. — ^Take the meat of a good- 
sized, fat chicken (boiled) ; add to it half a pound 
of good boiled beef's tongue, quarter of a pound of 
fresh butter, pepper and salt to taste, and about a 
dozen good boiled potatoes, and four good-sizeii 
onions. Chop all these ingredients fine, make a 
good crust, and cover the bottom of your dish. Put 
the ingredients in, and cook or bake it well. 

To Use the Meat and Gristle o*' a Soup

of flour, and sufficient water to make the gravy, and 
serve with dry bread toasted. Lay the bread on 
the plate and pour over it the fricassee. 

RissoLSS. — Chop the meat very fine ; if mutton, 
a little parsley will be an improvement ; season it, 
and rub some butter in. Make up the rissoles in 
the form of a sugar loaf, beat an egg and roll them 
in it, and then in bread crumbs, very fine, twice. 
Fry them a nice golden brown, and serve up with 
good gravy in the dish. Or: The meat must be 
chopped very fine. Take an equal quantity of 
bread crumbs, a tablespoonful of flour, a little all- 
spice, salt, and half an onion, chopped very fine, 
indeed. First mix the bread crumbs, flour, and 
spice together, then mix the meat well with it, 
sprinkle the onion over, stir all well together, and 
stir in two tablespoonfuls of bacon fat, or a rasher 
or two of bacon, finely minced. Make the mixture 
into balls with a very little milk, press them flat, 
roll each in flour, and drop them one at a time into 
a saucepan of boiling dripping, frying each simply 
in this way. When brown, take it out with an 
^g-slice, let the fat drain from it, place it on a pad 
of paper before the fire, so as to become quite dry. 

BissoLES OP Cold Meat. — To one pound of cold 
meat allow three-quarters of a pound of bread crumbs, 
talt and pepper, a tablespoonful of minced parsley,

Mince the meat very fine; mix all together. Divide 
into balls or cones, nicely shaped. Put them into a 
pan of boiling lard ; there mnst be enough lard to 
cover them. Fry the rissoles till they are a nice 
light brown. Serve witfi parsley for a garnish, or, 
if pr^rred, with gravy poured ovot them. Chicken 
or rabbit makes very delicious rissoles. 

RiSSABLES are made with veal and ham, chopped 
very fine, or pounded lightly; add a few bread 
crumbs, salt, pepper, nutmeg, and a little parsley 
and lemon-peel ; mix all together with the yelks of 
eggs, well beaten ; either roll them into shape like 
a flat sausage, or into the shape of pears, sticking a 
bit of horseradish in the ends to resemble the stalks. 
Egg each over, and grate bread crumbs. Fry them 
brown, and serve on crisp-fried parsley. 

liABD. — Leaf lard is the nicest for all cooking 
purposes. Skim all the iat that is to be tried into 
lard, and commence by frying gently a little leaf 
lard, or your fat will scorch. Let it cool slowly, 
and dip off the fat as soon as it is liquified, and 
strain it through a cloth. When all is strained that 
can be dipped off, squeeze the remainder by itself in 
the cloth. If the lard is to be used for cooking, salt 
it a trifle when first put on. Much of the salt will 
be found at the bottom of the kettle undissolved, 
still it would seem to be better that salt should l)e 
used.

the forcemeat will be ready for use. When it is 
made into balls, fry of a nice brown in boiling lard, 
or put them on a tin and bake for half an hour in a 
moderate oven. As we have stated before, no one 
lavor should predominate greatly, and the force- 
meat should be of suflBcientbody to cut with a knife, 
and yet not dry and heavy. For very delicate 
forcemeat it is advisable to pound the ingredients 
together before binding with the egg ; but for ordi-

Rolled Patties fbom Remains op Meat. — 
The remains of roast veal, or any roast meat, is 
chopped very fine with fiit or ham, adding to it a 
little nutmeg, salt, and butter, some ^gs, parsley, 
and chopped shalots. Stir this over the fire till 
thick enough for stuffing ; fill some rolls with t^is« 
and bake as the potties for field-fare. 

CULINARY COUPLETS. 

BY A BHTMINO EPICURE. 

Always have lobster sauce with salmon, 
And put mint sauce your roasted lamb on. 

Veal cutlets dip in egg and bread crumb — 
Fry till you see a brownish red come. 

Grate Gruyere cheese on macaroni ; 
Make the top crisp, but not too bony. 

In venison gravy, currant jelly 
Mix wkk old pM^t-^rae Fraiteat«Ui.

IflBOELLANBOUS. 447 

In dressing salad, mind this law — 
With two hard yelk« m»e one Ulat's raw. 

Boast Teal with rich stock gravy serve ; 
And pickled mushrooms, too, observe. 

Boast pork» sans apple sauce, past doubts 
Is " Hamlet" with the Prince left out. 

Tour mutton-chops with paper cover, 
And make tliem amber brown all over. 

Broil lightly your b'eelsteaks — to fry it 
Argues contempt of ChH^tian diet. 

Kidneys a finer flavor gain 

By stewing them in good champagne. 

Buy stall-fed pigeons. When you've got them, 
The way to cook them is to pot them. 

Woodgrouse are dry when guraps have marred *( 
Before you roast 'em always lard 'em. 

To roast spring chickens is to spoil 'em- 
Just split 'em down the back and broil 'em. 

It gives true epicures the vapors 
To see boiled mutton, minus capers. 

Boiled turkey, gourmands know, of course, 
Is exquisite with celery sauce. 

The cook deserves a hearty cu£Bng 

Who serves roast fowls with tasteless stuffing. 

Smelts require egg and biscuit powder. 
Don't put fat pork m your clam chowder. 

Egg sauce— few make it right, alas 1 
It good with blue-fish or with bass.

Nice oyster saace gires zest to cod — 
A fish, when fresh, to feast a god. 

Shad, staffed and baked, is most delicious— 
'Twoald have electrified Apicius. 

Roasted in paste, a hannch of mntton, 
Might make ascetics play the glatton. 

Bat one might rhyme for weeks this wfty. 
And still haTe lots of things to say. 

And so I'D close— for, reader ml&/e» 
This is about the hoar I dine.

PREFACE. 



In offering to the public the present vol- 
ume of valuable receipts, we feel that we are 
supplying a long-felt and urgent want. Al- 
though the market is over-stocked with so- 
called Cook Books, yet none of them contain 
the receipts here presented, nor do they con- 
tain those that will supply their places in a 
satisfactory manner. 

It has been in answer to frequent urgent 
inquiries from those who have tested these 
receipts as to where to find certain directions, 
that this book has been most carefully com- 
piled and published. 

It is almost needless to remind all house- 
keepers, that the best way to make a husband 
happy and contented is to feed him well. 
Nothing is of more importance in a household 



2 PREFACE. 

than good cooking ; and when so much com- 
fort and happiness can be gained at such a 
small expense, we wonder that more attention 
is not paid by housekeepers to this all-impor- 
tant subject. 

No trouble has been spared in the endeavor 
to render it complete and useful, by the addi- 
tion of a complete alphabetical index, that 
will aid those in search of any subject 
treated, to turn at once to the page wanted, 
without hunting through the whole book.

CHAPTER I. 

SOUPS. 

How TO Make Soups. — The word soup, to 
many minds, conveys the idea of something that 
is extravagantly rich in composition and elabo- 
rately difficult in manner of preparation. Conse- 
quently, we more frequently meet with soups as 
costly and cloying as real turtle, instead of finding 
them to be light, exhilarating and appetizing. Un- 
fortunately, many cooks do not appear to be alive 
to the fact that the less pretentious they'; make a 
soup the more certain it is to give satisfaction, and 
of all cooking, nothing is easier to do well, and 
nothing more difficult to do badly, than soup-mak- 
ing — too much pains being productive of the same 
results as too many cooks. Simply employ ingre- 
dients that are quite fresh, utensils that are thor- 
oughly clean, and skim carefully. 

If meat is used that is very fat, a cook is often 
obliged to let the soup grow cold, so as to remove 
all the fat from the top, re-warming the soup be- 
fore serving it ; but if we only make use of meat 
which is sufficiently lean, and do not neglect skim- 
ming the liquor while it is simmering, we shall be

18 SOUPS. 

spared the necessity of sacrificing the flavor of the 
soup for the sake of avoiding greasiness. A small 
quantity of fat, however, softens soup, half an 
ounce of butter to a quart of pottage being enough. 
Housekeepers should be aware that, though bones 
and bony joints are economical for soups, yet, when 
it can be had, the flesh of butchers' meat is prefer- 
able. Of course, this does not apply to poultry 
and game. A small slice of ham or sausage, an 
anchovy, or a spoonful of sugar, improves the fla- 
vor of soups generally. 

Any of the things from the following list will, 
with the proper addition of herbs, roots, and sea- 
soning, make a tureen of good soup for a small 
family: 

One pound of lean meat. 

A wild pigeon. 

A small rabbit. 

A sheep's or lamb's head. 

A chicken or old fowl. 

Two pounds of raw bones. 

A t^me pigeon. 

A set of giblets. 

The reduced liquor in which has been boiled 
a calf's head, fowl, turkey, rabbit, joint of meat, 
etc., etc. 

STOCKS FOE SOUPS AND HOW TO MAKE THEM. 

The word "stock" for soup frequently occurs 
in receipts. We now give some receipts for mak- 
ing them : 



SOUPS. 19 

Good SrocK foe Ordinary Purposes. — Four 
pounds of shin-bone, and one pound of lean neck 
of beef, four carrots,, one turnip, one stick of celery, 
two parsnips, two leeks, one onion, six cloves, six 
peppers, a bunch of sweet herbs, one gallon of 
water. Cut the meat into slices, crack the bone, 
and put it into an earthen pipkin that will stand 
the fire, as this makes far better soup than a metal 
saucepan ; add the water, and let it stew slowly 
till the scum rises, and skim it clear; stick the 
cloves into the onion and then add the vegetable^v 
and let the whole stew slowly till the meat is in 
rags, which will be in about eight hours. It must 
simmer very slowly, for if it boils, the meat will 
not yield the gravy so well, and the stock will be 
thick in place of being clear. When cold, it 
should be strained through a cullender and kept in 
a covered pan or jar for use. 

White Stock. — Four pounds of knuckle of 
veal, any poultry trimmings, four slices of lean 
ham, three carrots, two onions, one head of celery, 
twelve white pepper-corns, two ounces of salt, one 
blade of mace, a bunch of herbs, one ounce of but- 
ter, four quarts of water. Cut up the veal, and 
put it with the bones and trimmings of poultry, 
and the ham, into the stewpan, which has been 
rubbed with the butter. Moisten with half a pint 
of water, and simmer till the gravy begins to flow. 
Then add the four quarts of water and the re- 
mainder of the ingredients ; simmer for five hours. 



20 SOUPS. 

After skimming and straining it carefully through 
a very fine hair sieve, it will be ready for use. 
"Wlien stronger stock is desired, double the quan- 
tity of veal, and put in an old fowl. The liquor 
in which a young turkey has been boiled is an ex- 
cellent addition to all white stock or soup. 

Economical Stock — The liquor in which a 
joint of meat has been boiled, say four quarts ; 
trimmings of fresh meat or poultry, shank-bones, 
etc., roast-beef bones, any pieces the larder may 
furnish ; vegetables, spices, and the same seasoning 
as in the foregoing receipt. Let all the ingre- 
dients simmer gently for six hours, taking care to 
skim carefully at first. Strain it off, and put by 
for use. 

Rich Strong Stock. — Four pounds shin of 
beef, four pounds knuckle of veal, quarter pound 
of good lean ham, any poultry trimmings, two 
ounces of butter, three onions, tliree carrots, two 
turnips, (the latter should be omitted in summer, 
lest they ferment,) one head of celery, a few 
chopped mushrooms, when obtainable ; one tomato, 
a bunch of savory herbs, not forgetting parsley ; 
one and a half ounce of salt, three lumps of sugar, 
twelve white pepper-corns, six cloves, three small 
blades of mace, four quarts of water. Line a per- 
fectly clean stewpan with the ham cut in thin, 
broad slices, carefully trimming off all its rusty 
fat ; cut up the beef and veal in pieces about three 



ROUPS. 21 

inches square, t'.nd lay them on the ham ; set it on 
the stove, and draw it down, and stir frequently. 
When the meat is equally browned, put in the 
beef and veal bones, the poultry trimmings, and 
pour in the cold water. Skim well, and occasion- 
ally add a little cold water to stop its boiling, until 
it becomes quite clear ; then put in all the other 
ingredients, and simmer very slowly for five hours. 
Do not let it come to a brisk boil, that the stock 
be not wasted, and that its color may be preserved. 
Strain through a very fine hair sieve, or cloth, and 
the stock will be fit for use. 

Plain Beef Soup. — One gallon of cold water, 
one pound of beef and two tablespoonfuls of rice. 
Let this boil, then add an onion or two or three 
leeks ; boil an hour. Peel and slice eight potatoes ;. 
wash them in warm water ; add them to the soup, 
with a seasoning of salt and pepper; stir it fre- 
quently ; boil another hour, and then serve. 

Beef Soup. — Get what is called a good beef 
soup bone, boil two hours, leaving about two quarts 
of broth ; break two eggs into some flour, and knead 
it very stiff; roll out in three sheets to the thick- 
ness of wrapping paper ; spread them on a table to 
dry for half an hour ; then place them on one an- 
other and roll them up as you would jelly cake ; 
with a sharp knife cut very fine strips from the end, 
.not wider than the thickness of a case knife ; shake 
them up to sejmrate them; drop into your broth 



22 SOUPS. 

slowly, Stirling your soup all the while. Boil ten 
minutes ; season with pepper, salt, celery, or a little 
parsley. 

Mutton Soup. — A neck of mutton, weighing 
five or six pounds, three large carrots, three large 
turnips, two large onions, a bunch of sweet herbs; 
salt and pepper to taste ; a sprig of parsley, three 
quarts of water. 

Lay the ingredients in a covered pan before the 
fire, and let them remain there one day, stirring 
occasionally. The next day put the whole into a 
stewpan, and place it on a brisk fire. As soon as 
it boils, take the pan oif the fire, and put it on one 
side to simmer until the meat is done. When 
ready for use, take out the meat, dish it with the 
carrots and turnips ; strain the soup, let it cool, skim 
off the fat, season it, and thicken it with a table- 
spoonful of arrowroot dissolved in cold water. 
Simmer for five minutes before serving. 

Mutton Broth. — Take two pounds of scrag 
mutton ; to take the blood out, put it into a stewpan, 
and cover it with cold water ; when the water be- 
comes milk warm, pour it off; then put it in four or 
five pints of water, with a teaspoonful of salt, a 
tablespoonful of best grits, and an onion ; set it on 
a slow fire, and when you have taken all the scum 
off, put in two or three turnips; let it simmer very 
slowly for two hours, and strain it through a clean 
sieve. . . 



SOUPS. 23 

Nursery Soup. — To be prepared the day before 
it is wanted for use. Two pounds of scrag mutton 
or the knuckle of a leg ; put it into two quarts of 
cold water ; add two large turnips, sliced, and a table- 
spoonful of rice or barley. Let this simmer for one 
hour ; take out the meat from the soup into a dish, 
and put away the liquor until the next day, when 
all the fat must be removed from the top. 

Turn the soup into a pot and add the meat cut 
into small pieces, a finely minced onion, a little 
parsley, a small head of celery, an ounce of butter, 
a tablespoonful of flour, mixed in cold water to the 
consistency of cream, burn a little brown sugar in 
an iron spoon, and pour a little boiling water over 
it into the flour ; strain the browned flour into the 
soup, add the other ingredients ; let all boil for an 
hour, when serve with small square dice of toasted 
bread. 

Economical Veal Soup. — Boil a piece of veal, 
suitable for a fricassee, pie, or hash. When tender, 
take the meat up and slip out all the bones ; put 
these back into the kettle and boil for two hours. 
Then strain the liquor, and stand away until the 
next day. When wanted, take ofi" the fat, put the 
soup into a clean pot, add pepper, salt, an onion, 
a half teacupful of rice, a tablespoonful of flour 
mixed in cold water, and slices of potato. Boil 
thirty minutes and serve hot. 

liOTATiON OF Mock-Turtle Soup. — Put int^ 



24 SOUPS. 

a pan a knuckle of veal, two calf's feet, two onions, 
a few cloves, peppers, allspice, mace, and sweet 
herbs; cover them with water, then tie a thick 
-paper over the pan, and set it in an oven for three 
hours. When cold, take off the fat very nicely, cut 
the meat and feet into bits an inch and a half square, 
remove the bones and coarse parts, and then put 
the rest on to warm, with a large spoonful of walnut 
and one of mushroom ketchup, half a pint of sherry, 
or Madeira wine, a little mushroom powder, and 
the jelly of the meat. When hot, if it requires any 
further seasoning, add some, and serve with hard 
eggs, forcemeat balls and a squeeze of lemon soy. 

Veal Gravy Soup. — Garnish the bottom of 
a stewpan with thin pieces of lard, add a few slices 
of ham, slices of veal cutlet, slices of onion, carrot, 
parsnips, celery, a few cloves upon the meat, and a 
spoonful of broth. Soak it on the fire in this way 
until the veal throws out its juice. Then put it on 
a stronger fire until the meat catches to the bottom 
of the pan, and is well browned. Then add about 
two quarts of light broth, and simmer all on a slow 
fire until the meat is thoroughly done ; add a little 
thyme and mushrooms. Skim and strain all clear 
for use. 

White Soup. — Boil a knuckle of veal and four 
calf's feet in five quarts of water, with three sliced 
onions, a bunch of sweet herbs, four heads of white 
celery, cut small, a tablespoonful of whole pepper, 
a small teaspoonful of salt, and six large blades of 



SOUPS. 25 

mace. Let all boil very slowly till the meat is in 
rags, and has dropped from the bone, and the gristle 
has quite dissolved. Skim well while boiling. AYhen 
done strain through a sieve into a deep white ware 
pan. Next day take off all the fat, and put the jelly 
into a clean soup pot, with two ounces of vermicelli ; 
set over a clear fire. When the vermicelli is dis- 
solved stir in, gradually, a pint of thick cream while 
the soup is hot. Do not let it come to a boil after 
the cream is in, lest it should curdle. Cut up a few 
rolls in the bottom of a tureen, pour on the soup, 
and serve. 

Calf's Head Soup. — Procure a calf's head, wash 
it well, and let it stand in salt and water two or three 
hours. Then soak it in fresh water. Put it on to 
boil, and when the meat will separate from the bone 
take it off. Strain the broth, cut the meat in small 
pieces, and add it to the broth. Then season with 
sweet marjoram, sage, thyme, sweet basil, pepper, 
salt, mace, and cloves. Take one pound of suet, and 
two pounds of veal, chopped fine, and, with sufficient 
bread crumbs and seasoning as above, make some 
forcemeat balls, and fry them in butter. Make also 
some small dumplings with a little flour, butter, and 
water. Add the dumplings, the forcemeat balls, two 
or three eggs, chopped fine, a spoonful of browned 
flour, and as much wine as you think fit to the soup. 

Yeemicelli Soup. — Put a shin of veal, one 
onion, two carrots, two turnips, and a little salt into 



26 SOUPS. 

four quarts of water. Boil this three hours. Add 
two cups of vermicelli, and boil it an hour and a 
half longer. Before serving take out the bone and 
vegetables. 

Salt Meat Soup. — Two pounds of salt beef or 
salt pork, four carrots, four parsnips, four turnips, 
four potatoes, one cabbage, two ounces of ground 
rice, seasoning of salt and pepper, two quarts of 
water. Cut the meat in small pieces, add the water, 
and let it simmer for three quarters of an hour. Cut 
the vegetables in thin slices, add them to the meat, 
and boil all together for one hour. Thicken with 
the rice flour dissolved in cold water. Simmer for 
five minutes, and serve. 

Chicken Beoth. — Cut up a chicken (an old 
one is best), and put it into an iron pot with two 
quarts of water, one onion, two tablespoonfuls of 
rice, and a little salt. Boil for two hours, and strain 
through a sieve. 

Brown Chicken Soup. — Cut up a nicely dressed 
chicken. Put it in the pot with water to cover it, 
which must be measured, and half as much more 
added to it before the soup is dished. Keep it cov- 
ered tight, boiling slowly, and take off the fafas fast 
as it rises. When the chicken is tender take it from 
the pot and mince it very fine. Season it to the 
taste, and brown it with butter in* a dripping pan. 
When brown put it back in the pot. Brown together 
butter and flour, and make rich gravy by adding a 



SOUPS. 27 

pint of the soup. Stir this in the soup, apd season 
it with a little pepper, salt, and butter. Be careful 
the chopped chicken does not settle and burn on the 
pot. It will be well to turn a small plate on the 
bottom of the kettle to prevent this. Toast bread 
quite brown and dry, but do not burn it, and lay 
the toast in the tureen, and serve it with the soup. 
Stir the chicken through it, and pour it in the 
tureen. 

Partridge Soup. — A brace of old partridges 
make a capital soup. Cut them up, and together 
with some celery, a slice of ham, and an onion, 
sliced ; toss them in a little butter and set over the 
fire until they are somewhat browned. Stew them, 
closely covered, in five pints of water, for two 
hours ; strain the soup, heat it again, and add to it 
some small dice of toasted bread, and a little 
stewed celery. Season with salt and pepper and 
serve hot. 

Rabbit Soup. — Cut one or two rabbits into 
joints ; lay them for an hour in cold water ; dry 
and fry them in butter till about half done, with 
four or five onions and a middling-sized head of 
celery cut small ; add to this three quarts of cold 
water, one pound of sj^lit peas, some pepper and 
salt ; let it stew gently for four or five hours, then 
strain and serve it. 

Carrot Soup. — Four quarts of liquor in which 
a leg of mutton or a piece of beef has been boiled 



28 SOUPS. 

a beef or mutton bone, six large carrots, two large 
onions, one large turniji; seasoning of salt and 
pepper to taste. Put the liquor, bones, onions, 
turnips, pepper and salt into a stewpan, and sim- 
mer for three hours. Scrape the carrots and cut 
them in thin slices, strain the soup over them, and 
stew till soft enough to pulp through a hair sieve or 
coarse cloth ; boil the pulp in the soup until about 
the consistency of pea soup ; add Cayenne. Pulp 
only the red part of the carrot, and make the soup 
the day before it is served. 

Vegetable Soup. — Peel and slice six large 
onions, six potatoes, six carrots, and four turnips • 
fry them in half a pound of butter, and pour on 
them four quarts of boiling water. Toast a crust 
of bread as brown and hard as possible, but do not 
burn it, and put it in, with some celery, sweet 
herbs, white pepper and salt. Stew it all gently 
for four hours, and then strain it through a coarse 
cloth. Have ready thinly sliced carrot, celery and 
a little turnip. Add them to your liking, and 
stew them tender in the soup. If approved of, a 
spoonful of tomato catsup may be added. 

Clear Gravy Soup. — Lay at the bottom of 
the stewpan half a pound of lean ham sliced, then 
three pounds of lean beef, and over it three pounds 
of veal, all in slices. If any bones be left, break 
them and lay them on the meat ; peel four onions, 
slice two carrots, two turnips, and a head of celery, 



eoups. 29 

and with a bunch of sweet herbs, four cloves, and a 
blade of mace, add all to the meat, over which 
pour one quart only of water, and place the stew- 
pan, covered, over a slow fire till the meat is 
brown; then turn it, but be careful it does not 
scorch. Then add three quarts of boiling water, 
and let it stew gently for an hour till you have 
carefully removed all the scum that rises; after 
which, place the stewpan at the side of the fire, 
now adding two teaspoonfuls of salt. Let it sim- 
mer for four hours, strain it through a tamis into 
an earthenware vessel, and set it by to cool. Then 
carefully remove the fat ; and when poured off to 
heat, do not disturb the sediment. The soup 
should be perfectly clear, and of an amber color ; 
and will look better without any addition of vege- 
tables. 

Gumbo. — Take one chicken, two slices of cold 
cooked ham, three large onions; cut the chicken 
into pieces after it has laid in salt and water a half 
hour; slice the onions, and put all into a skillet 
with the ham, and fry together, until a nice brown, 
add a large tablespoonful of butter. Take half 
a gallon of young okra sliced very thin. After 
peeling one quart of ripe tomatoes, add to the okra 
with three quarts of water ; let it boil well, then 
add the fried meat and onions; season with Cayenne 
and black pepper, salt to taste. Boil about four 
hours until the okra is perfectly dissolved, over a 
slow fire. Tlien strain, according to taste. Some 



30 SOUPS. 

prefer It not strained, and not too thick ; in that 
o^se do not let it boil quite so long. It is then 
ready for table. 

Okra or Gumbo Soup. — Boil a chicken and a 
slice of ham in sufficient water to make a tureen of 
eoup. When the fowl is thoroughly done, take it 
with the ham from the broth. Flavor the soup 
with onions, pepper, salt, and sweet herbs; -make 
a paste with eggs and flour, roll it as thin as 
wafers, dry a little, then roll it as tightly as 
possible, and slice in thin shreds ; put in the soup a 
teacupful of this, a teacupful of chopped okra, and 
a pint of oysters. 

Southern Gumbo Soup. — Fry one chicken, 
when cut up, to a light brown ; also two slices of 
bacon, pour on them three quarts of boiling water, 
add one onion and some sweet herbs tied in a rag ; 
simmer them gently three hours and a half; strain 
off the liquor, take off the fat, and then put the ham 
and chickens cut into small pieces into the liquor; 
add half a teacup of okra, also half a teacup of rice. 
Boil all half an hour, and just before serving add a 
glass of wine and a dozen oysters with their juice. 

Soup for the Million. — Put the bones, skin, 
and all the rough residue of any joint, into a sauce- 
pan, with a quart and half a pint of cold water, one 
large carrot, scraped and cut up, two large onions, 
sliced and fried brown in one ounce of butter ; and 



SOUPS. 31 

one very small head of celery washed and cut up. 
Let it stew for two hours ; then add three medium- 
sized potatoes, peeled; a saltspoonfuUof salt ; half a 
saltspoonful of pepper, and half a saltspoonful of 
mustard. Let it simmer three quarters of an hour 
longer. Take out the bones and then rub the 
whole through a sieve. 

Lobster Soup. — A shin of veal, two carrots, 
two onions, pepper, salt, mace, and four quarts of 
M'^ater ; boil together four hours. Break up a large 
boiled lobster, take the meat out of the shell, break 
up the shell into a stewpan, with water enough to 
cover it. Let this simmer M'hile the soup is boil- 
ing. Strain the vegetables, meat, and lobster shell, 
and put the liquor into the soup pot. Cut the 
meat of the lobster fine, and boil in the soup two 
hours. If you have the roe or coral of the lobster, 
grate it into the soup, as it adds to its tempting ap- 
pearance. Add a quarter of a pound of butter, 
braided into two tablespoonfuls of flour, a cup of 
wine, the juice of a lemon, or a tablespoonful of 
vinegar. 

New England Chowder. — A good haddock, 
cod, or any other solid fish. Cut in pieces three inches 
square. Put a pound of fat salt pork cut in strips 
into a stewpan, set it on hot coals, and fry out the 
oil. Take out the pork, put in a layer of fish, 
over that a layer of onions in slices, another layer 
oi fish with strips of fat salt pork, another layer

:32 SOUPS. 

of onions. Alternate in this way until your fish 
is consumed. Mix some flour with as much water 
as will fill the pot, season with black pepper and 
salt to taste, and boil fi:>r half an hour. Have 
ready some crackers (Philadelphia pilot bread is 
the best) soaked in water until they are a little 
softened ; throw them into the chowder five min- 
utes before taking it off the fire. Serve in a tureen. 

Oyster Soup. — To one hundred oysters take 
one quart of milk, half a pint of water, four spoon- 
fuls of flour, half a cup of butter, and one teasjjoon- 
ful of salt, with a very little Cayenne peppt^r . Boll 
and skim the liquor of the oysters. Steam the flour 
and butter over the teakettle until soft enough to 
beat to a froth ; then stir it in the liquor while boil- 
ing; after which add the other ingredients, and 
throw in the oysters, allowing them merely to scald. 

Clam Soup. — Separate fifty small clams from 
the juice, which put into a stewpan, and let sim- 
mer five minutes, put it on to cook and slowly 
add two tablespoonfuls of butter and one of flour 
rubbed together, stirring it well ; after this add half 
a teaspoonful of salt, half a nutmeg, and one pint of 
cream or milk, stir all well ; let it simmer ten min- 
utes; chop up parsley and add the clams. One boil 
up is sufficient, as clams require little cooking. If 
large clams are used, it is necessary to chop them up. 

Bisque of Lobster. — A soup made with fish 
is always called a bisque. It is made either with 



SOUPS. 33 

crabs or lobsters. Remove a portion from either 
side of the head and use the rest. To boil a lobster, 
put it in a fish-kettle, and cover it with cold water, 
cooking it on a quick fire. Two lobsters will make 
soup for six or eight persons, and also salad. All 
the under shell and small claws are pounded in a 
mortar to make the bisque. When it is pounded, 
put it in a pan and set it on the fire with broth or 
water. The meat is cut in small pieces to be added 
afterwards. The bisque is left on the fire to boil 
gently for half an hour. Then pour it into a sieve 
and press it with a masher to extract the juice. To 
make it thicker a small piece of parsnip can be 
added and mashed with the rest into a pan, so that 
all the essence is extracted in that way from the 
lobster. When you have strained it, put a little 
butter with it, and add as much broth as is re- 
quired. Put some of the meat in the soup tureen, 
and pour the soup over it. 

Coloring for Soups. — As soups often require 
coloring, it is well to prepare browning for that 
purpose. Two baked onions, well browned in the 
oven and then chopped fine, make an excellent 
coloring and flavoring. The shells of green peas 
dried in the oven brown, but not black, will also 
answer to brown soup, and will keep all winter if 
hung in a perfectly dry place. 

It will be found much better to use either of the 
above for coloring soup than the caramel or brown 



34 SOUPS. 

sugar used by many cooks, as the sweet taste is apt 
to be perceptible. 

Roast Veal and Chicken Bones make a very 
nice soup, boiled with vegetables ; but add a hand- 
ful of macaroni, break it up fine, and boil the soup 
half an hour after it is put in. Color the soup 
with a little soy or ketchup. 



CHAPTER II. 

FISH. 

To Bake a Large Fish Whole. — Cut off the 
head, and split the fish down nearly to the tail; 
prepare a nice dressing of bread, butter, pepper and 
salt, moistened with a little water. Fill the fish 
with this dressing, and bind it together with fine 
cotton cord or tape, so as to confine it; the bindings 
may be three inches apart ; lay the fish on a grate 
on a bake pan or a dripping-pan, and pour round 
it a little water and melted butter. Baste frequently. 
A good sized fish will bake in an hour. Serve 
with the gravy of the fish, drawn butter or oyster 
sauce. 

Rock Fish. — Rock fish or bass are best boiled 
plain, leaving on the head and tail. Boil steadily 
for half an hour. Serve with drawn butter with 
hard boiled eggs in it, chopped fine. 

Stuffed Fish. — Soak some bread in water, and 
squeeze it out, add a small onion, chopped fine, 
fried with butter till nearly done ; add to the onion 
the bread, salt, pepper, a little nutmeg, a little 
broth, the yelk of one egg. Stir rapidly, cooking 
over a clear fire ; when done, add a little parsley, 

35 



36 ■ FISH. 

chopped fine. Cut the back-bone out of a two 
pound fish, put the stuffing in its place, and sew it 
up with a trussing needl» and twine ; put a little 
salt and pepper on the fish, inside and outside, a 
few pieces of butter under it in the pan, cover 
with a gill of broth, and bake in the oven. 

To Fry Trout. — Dry them thoroughly, and fry 
in hot oiled butter without scorching, or in pork fat. 
If the latter rub salt on the fish. Lay on the fish, 
before serving, lumps of sweet butter. 

Sturgeon.' — The meat of this tenant of the deep 
waters partakes very much of the properties of veal, 
both in flavor and appearance, and is of an insipid 
character unless it is treated with conrliments so as 
to render it commendable to the palate of the gas- 
tronomist. When purchased at the fishmonger's it 
should be cut into small fillets about one inch in 
thickness, and these should be covered over on both 
sides with a liberal supply of crumbs of bread, 
chopped parsley, lemon rind, and an egg to cause 
the above to adhere to the meat. Wrap the fillets in 
clean v/hite writing paper, which has been buttered 
on the inside, and place on a gridiron over a clear 
fire until they are well done. Serve them with a 
sauce of melted butter, caviare and catsup, with salt 
and pepper to taste. 

Fried Cod-Fish. — Take the middle or tail part 
of a fresh cod-fish, and cut it into slices not quite an 
inch thick, first removing the skin. Season them 



FISH. 37 

with a little salt and Cayenne pepj>er. Have ready 
in one dish some beaten yelk of egg, and in another 
some grated bread crumbs. Dip each slice of fish 
twice into the egg, and then twice into the crumbs. 
Fry them in fresh butter, and serve them up with 
the gravy about them. 

Halibut may be fried as above. 

Fried Eels. — Clean and skin the eels. If large 
cut them into pieces, if small skewer them round 
and fry them whole. First dust them over with 
flour, then rub them with yelk of egg and sprinkle 
them with bread crumbs. Put them into boiling 
lard and fry until nicely browned. 

Potted Salmon. — Salmon, pounded mace, 
cloves, and pepper to taste, three bay leaves, a quar- 
ter of a pound of butter. Skin the salmon, and 
clean it thoroughly by wiping with a cloth (water 
M'ould spoil it). Cut it into square pieces, which 
rub with salt, let them remain till thoroughly 
drained, then lay them in a dish with the other in- 
gredients, and bake. When quite done drain them 
from the gravy, press into pot"? for use, and when 
cold pour over it clarified butter. 

To Pickle Fish. — Take any freshly caught fish, 
clean and scale them, wash and M'ipe them dry. Cut 
them into slices a few inches thick, put them in a 
jar with some salt, some allspice, and a little horse- 
radish. When filled cover them with good strong 
vinegar. Cover it well with a good cover. Let it 



38 FISH. 

stand in your oven a few hours. Don't let the oven 
be too hot. This will keep six months. Put it 
immediately in the cellar, and in a few months they 
will be fit for use. No bones will be found. 

To Pickle Herrings, — Wash fifty herrings well, 
and cut off their heads, tails, and fins. Put the fish 
into a stewpan, with three ounces of ground allspice, 
one tablespoonful of coarse salt, and a little Cayenne. 
Lay the fish in layers, and strew the spice equally 
over it, with a few bay leaves and anchovies inter- 
spersed. Pour over the whole a pint of vinegar 
mixed with a little water. Tie a bladder over the 
stewpan and^bake in a slow oven. Skim off the 
oil, and with a little of the liquor boil about half a 
pint of claret or port wine. The fish should be 
baked so slowly and so thoroughly that when cooked 
the bones should not be perceptible. 

Salt Fish. — Lay the fish to soak over night in 
cold water with a little vinegar in it. Wash it thor- 
oughly, put it into a fish-kettle, with sufficient cold 
water to cover it. Let it heat gradually, but not 
boil quickly, or the fish will become hard. A large 
fish will require to be kept boiling half an hour. 
Before taking the fish from the kettle remove all 
the scum from the top of the water. Drain well. 
Parsnips may be laid around the fish on the edge of 
the dish, and hard boiled eggs, cut in slices, between 
the parsnips. Parsnip and egg sauce, in sepamte 
dishes, should also be served with salt fish. 



FISH. 39 

Salt Fish with Paesnips. — Salt fish must 
always be well soaked in plenty of cold water the 
whole of the night before it is required for the fol- 
lowing day's dinner. The salt fish must be put on 
to boil in plenty of cold water, without any salt, 
and when thoroughly do-ne should be well drained 
free from any water, and placed on a dish with 
plenty of well-boiled parsnips. Some sauce may be 
poured over the fish, which is to be made as follows, 
viz. : Mix two ounces of butter with three ounces of 
flour, pepper, and salt, a small glassful of vinegar, 
and a good half pint of water. Stir this on the fire 
till it boils. A few hard-boiled eggs chopped up 
and mixed in this sauce would render the dish more 
acceptable. 

PiCKED-up Codfish. — This is an old-fashioned 
dish and name, but none the less to be admired on 
that account, being with most persons, when prop- 
erly prepared, a great favorite. Pick up the fish in 
small particles, separating the fibres as near as pos- 
sible, the finer the better. Freshen by leaving it in 
water one hour. Pour off the water and fill up with 
fresh. Bring it to a scald, pour it off, and put on 
the fish just enough water to cover it. Add to a 
quart of the soaked fish a bit of butter the size of 
half an egg, a very little flour, and a dust of pepper. 
Beat up tAvo eggs, and after taking off the fish thicken 
it by stirring in the egg. Some let it boil after the 
egg is added, but if this is done the egg will be cur- 



40 FISH. 

died. Another way is to boil eggs, chop and mix 
them in the gravy. 

Codfish Balls. — Pick up as fine as possible a 
teacup of nice white codfish. Freshen all night, or 
if wanted for any other meal than breakfast, from 
the morning. Scald it once, and drain off the water. 
Chop and work it until entirely fine. Put it in a 
basin with water, a bit of butter the size of an egg, 
and two eggs. Beat it thoroughly, and heat it until 
it thickens without boiling. It should, when all is 
mixed, be about a quart. Have some potatoes ready 
prepared and nicely mashed. Work the fish and 
potatoes thoroughly together as above, make it in flat 
cakes, and brown both sides. 

Cod Sounds (An Entree). — Boil the sounds 
gently, and not too much. Take them out of the 
water and let them remain until quite cold. Make 
a forcemeat out of choppedrf)ysters, crumbs of bread, 
a lump of butter, spice, pepper and salt, and the 
yelks of two eggs. Fill the sounds and skewer them 
up in the shape of chickens, and lard them down 
each side in the same manner as though they were 
the breasts of fowls. Dredge them with flour, put 
them before the fire to bake, basting them well with 
butter. When they are sufficiently cooked, pour 
upon them some oyster sauce. They make an excel- 
lent entree. 

Fish Cake. — Carefully remove the bones and 
skin from any fish, previously cooked, and let it 



FISH. 41 

soak for a short time in warm water. After taking 
it out, press it dry, add to it an equal quantity of 
mashed potatoes, and beat together in a mortar to a 
fine paste; season to taste. Then make up the 
mass into round flat cakes, sift a little flour over 
each one, and fry in butter or lard till they are 
brown. Codfish recooked in this way is an ex- 
cellent breakfast dish. 

Kedjeree. — Take some fish that has been 
dressed, bone it carefully, and pull it into very 
small bits. Add hard-boiled eggs chopped, and as 
much rice well boiled as you require to fill your 
dish. Mix all these well together, with sufficient 
butter or cream to moisten .them, adding a little 
Cayenne, mustard, and salt. Put all into a sauce- 
pan and stir with a fork (not a spoon) until quite 
hot. The fire must not be too fierce, and the dish 
must be served up very hot. 

Lobster Patties. — Make some puff paste, and 
spread it on very deep patty pans. Bake it empty. 
Having boiled well two fine lobsters, extract all the 
meat and mince it very small, mixing with it the 
coral smoothly mashed, and some yelks of hard 
boiled eggs, grated. Season it with a little salt, 
some Cayenne, some powdered mace or nutmeg, 
adding a little yellow lemon rind, grated. Moisten 
the mixture well with cream, fresh butter, or salad 
oil. Put it into a stewpan, add a very little water, 
and let it stew till it just comes to a boil. Take it 



42 PISH,- 

off the fire, and the patties being oa^ed, remove 
hem from the tin pans, place them on a large dish, 
and fill them to the top with the mixtures. Simi- 
lar patties may be made of crabs. 

Lobster Rissoles. — Extract the meat of a 
boiled lobster, mince it as fine as possible, mix with 
it the coral, pounded smooth, and some yelks of 
hard-boiled eggs, pounded also. Season it witL 
Cayenne pepper, powdered mace, and a very littk 
salt. Make a batter of beaten egg, milk, and flour. 
To each egg allow two large tablespoonfuls of milk, 
and a large teaspoonful of flour. Beat the batter 
well, and then mix the lobster with it gradually, 
till it is stiff enough to make into oval balls about 
the size of a large plum. Fry them in the best 
salad oil, and serve them either warm or cold. Simi- 
lar rissoles may be made of raw oysters, minced fine, 
or of boiled clams. These should be fried in krd. 

To Fey Oysters. — Beat up an egg in one ves- 
sel and grate one or two crackers in another. Dip 
the oysters singly, first into the egg, then into the 
cracker. Fry the oysters so prepared in equal parts 
of butter and lard. It is also recommended to dry 
the oysters with a towel, beforehand. Clams may 
be fried in the same way. 

Pickled Oysters. — Lay the oysters on a siev3 
to drain the liquor from them ; leave it to f ittle, 
then pour off the clear portion, and boil it nj well 
with pepper, salt, mace, and ginger to the taste then 



PISH. 43 

wash the oysters well in several waters to remove 
all the slime, and give them one boil up in the 
liquor. 

Oyster Stew. — To one hundred oysters, take 
one quart of milk, a half pint of water, four table- 
spoonfuls of flour, one teaspoonful of salt, a half 
cup of butter and a little Cayenne pepper. Put the 
liquor of the oysters on to boil. Mix butter and 
flour and steam it in a bowl over the teakettle till 
soft enough to beat to a froth, then stir it into the 
liquor, after which add the other ingredients. 

German Receipt for Oyster Powder. — 
Take fresh oysters, beard them, and place them in 
a vessel over the fire for a few moments in order to 
extract the juice, then put them to cool, and chop 
them very fine with pounded biscuit, mace, and 
finely-minced lemon-peel ; pound them until they 
become a paste; make them up into thin cakes, 
place them on a sheet of paper in a slow oven, and 
let them bake until they become quite hard, pound 
them directly into powder, and place the powder in 
a nice, dry tin box. Keep in a dry place, and when 
oysters are out of season you will find this powder 
very serviceable in impartin g the flavor of the fish 
to various sauces and dishes. 

Crumbed Oysters. — Eight square soda-crack- 
ers rolled fine, seven ounces of butter, one quart of 
oysters ; drain the oysters ; put the crackers and 
oysters in alternate layers; divide the butter equally, 



44 FISH. 

putting it on the oysters at each layer, witii a dust 
of pepper ; be careful not to salt too much, leaving 
the bottom and top layer crackers. A moment 
before baking add a coffee cup of tiie liquor from 
the oysters ; bake a light brown. 

Scalloped Oysters. — Wash out of the liquor 
two quarts of oysters, pound very fine eight soft 
crackers, or grate a stale loaf of bread ; butter a 
deep dish, sprinkle in a layer of crumbs, then a 
layer of oysters, a little raace, pepper, and bits of 
butter ; another layer of crumbs, another of oysters, 
then seasoning as before, and so on until the dish 
is filled ; cover the dish over with bread-crumbs, 
seasoning as before ; turn over it a cup of the oyster 
liquor. Set it into the oven for thirty or forty 
minutes to brown. 

Oyster Forcemeat. — Open carefully a dozen 
fine plump natives, take off the beards, strain the 
liquor, and rinse the oysters in it. Grate four 
ounces crumb of a stale loaf into fine light crumbs, 
mince the oysters, but not too small, and mix them 
with the bread ; add one and a half ounce of good 
butter, broken into minute bits, the grated rind of 
half a small lemon, a small saltspoonful of pounded 
mace, some Cayenne, a little salt, and a large tea- 
Bpoonful of parsley; mix these ingredients well, 
and work them together with the unbeaten yelk of 
one egg, and a little oyster liquor, the remainder 
of which can be added to the sauce which usually 
accompanies this forcemeat. 



FISH. 45 

Oyster Patties in Batter. — Make a batter 
with the yelk of one egg (or more, according to the 
quantity of oysters you intend to prepare), a little 
nutmeg, some beaten mace, a little flour, and a 
little salt; dip in the oysters, and fry them in lard 
to a nice light brown. If preferred, a little parsley 
may be shred very fine, and mixed with the batter. 
The batter may also be made thicker, and formed 
into the shape of a patty, or put into a small tin 
mould, the oyster being dropped in and covered 
over, and the whole baked as a pudding would be. 

Oyster Omelette. — Three eggs well beaten, a 
little parsley, and an onion well minced, a little 
pepper and salt, one dozen good oysters ; fry in 
butter with a little cream. The omelette must not 
be turned, but when done on the one side must be 
browned, or held close to the fire when it rises and 
browns ; serve hot with good gravy. 

Oyster Sauce. — Boil the oysters in their own 
liquor until they look plump, then take them out 
and strain the liquor; add to it wine, vinegar, and 
pepper to your taste, and pour it over the oysters. 

Clam Fritters. — Strain the clams thoroughly 
from •the juice, chop them fine, season with pepper 
and salt, and add an egg or two, with a little cream 
or milk ; sift in flour enough to make them stick 
together — and fry. 

To Boil Crabs. — Boil for twenty minutes, wipe 
and crack the claws, rub the shells with oil, and 



46 FISH. 

dish as with lobster. To cook soft- shell crabs, re- 
move the claws, cut open and take away the sand- 
bag and spongy part ; then put some butter in a 
pan and fry brown on both sides. 

Terrapins. — Boil three terrapins till the bones 
can be easily removed, after which chop the meat 
very fine ; add two tablespoonfuls of butter, one pint 
of tomato catsup, half a pint of sherry or Madeira 
wine, one tablespoonful of mixed mustard, two 
onions, boiled and chopped fine, salt, black and red 
pepper to taste ; stir tlie mixture well ; scrape and 
clean two of the backs. 



CHAPTER III. 

SAUCES AND PICKLES 

Sao<'ES. — Melted butter, a sauce, is, in its 
simplest form, a mixture of butter, flour, salt and 
water; and the talent consists in bringing those 
ingredients together, and in the quantities employed 
of each. It ouffht not to be a mixture of flour and 
water with a little butter added to it — this is the 
common form — but, as its name implies, it ought 
to be butter and water, 'with a little flour added to 
it to thicken the mixture. If you like your sauce 
thick, put more flour ; and if thin, put less. To be 
well made, the sauce should be smooth and velvety 
in appearance, and, above all, devoid of what are 
called knobs. To obtain this result proceed in 
this way : Melt the butter in a saucepan, and then 
add the flour, which will amalgamate very easily 
with it ; salt and stir in enough of hot water, keep 
stirring the mixture on the fire until it thickens 
ttien serve. 

The above is the simplest form, but like all simple 
things, it is the foundation of an imposing array of 
sauces, to be eaten with fish, flesh, fowl, and vege- 
tables without end. 

4 47 



48 SAUCES AND PICKLES. 

1. Beat up the yelk of an egg and the juice of a 
lemon, and stir in just before serving, off the fire. 

2. Use milk, or milk and water, instead of 
water. 

3. Throw in, just before serving, some chopped 
parsley, capers, or pickles chopped small. These 
additions are not incompatible with the arrange- 
ments Nos. 1 and 2. 

4. Let the butter and flour get a good brown 
color, then add water, and when the sauce is made, 
Worcester Sauce, ketchup, pepper and other spices 
and condiments to taste. 

5. Use a mixture of half water and half tomato 
sauce instead of water, and add condiments to taste, 
if the tomato sauce is not sufficiently flavored. 

N. B. — This is not to be used in dressing maca- 
roni, but only for cutlets, boiled fowls, with rice, 
various vegetables, etc. 

6. Cut up some onions, a very small piece of 
garlic, and boil in milk, with whole pepper, mace, 
a clove or two, etc., tied up in a piece of muslin, 
and some parsley. When the mixture is well 
flavored, strain and use the milk instead of water 
to make your sauce ; egg and lemon may be added 
if wished. Without these last two it is not a bad 
substitute for onion sauce. Shad or rock fish 
boiled in the flavored milk, and served with the 
sauce over them, are not bad eating. The great 
rock to be avoided is excess of any one thing in 
flavoring the milk, chiefly in the spice line.

7. For puddings and sweet dishes the sauce is 
made in the same way, excepting that the salt is 
replaced by sugar, in larger quantities, of course. 
This should be made with milk, or milk and water, 
find an egg or two used, with or without lemon, 
according to taste; or the egg should be beaten up 
with brandy or wine. 

Mushroom Catsup. — Get fine-grown, fresh- 
gathered mushrooms, break them up, and sprinkle 
a good handful of salt over every layer. Let them 
lie for all the juice to run out, stirring them up 
often, but put no v/ater. When the juice has run 
out, strain it off, and boil it well, with very little 
ginger, and a sufficient quantity of pepper. It is a 
mistake to give mushroom catsup all kinds of fla- 
vorings, as it is the full flavor of the mushroom 
which it is all-important to preserve, and in using 
it the cook can add the spices her dish requires. 
All that is necessary or good to make the catsup 
keep is to put salt and pepper enough. A mat- 
ter of yet greater importance is to use the pure 
juice without water, as any mixture of water 
spoils the flavor and the keeping, too. There is 
no better- sauce for fried or broiled fish than a 
really good mushroom catsup, and nothing else; 
and mixed with equal parts of soy and lemon 
pickle, it makes a delicious flavoring for any sauce 
or gravy. Make it a quartette with a fourth equal 
part of red wine, and " it 's no ill," as the Scot 
says. 



60 SAUCES AND PICKLES. 

Tomato Catsup. — Take six pounds of tomatoes, 
sprinkle them with salt, let them remain for a day 
or two, then boil them until the skins will separate 
easily ; press them through a colander or coarse 
sieve, leaving the skins behind. Put into the liquor 
a handful of shalots, a pint of Chili vinegar, a pint 
of wine, salt, pepper, cloves, ginger, and allspice. 
Boil all together until a third is wasted, bottle it, 
and when it is cold cork the bottles very well. 
Shake it before using it. Good either for sauce or 
for flavoring. 

Tomato Maemalade. — Take fine ripe toma- 
toes, cut them in halves, and squeeze out the juice. 
Put them in a preserving- pan, with a few peach- 
leaves, a clove of garlic, some slices of onion or 
shalot, and a bundle of parsley. Stew them until 
they are sufficiently done, pulp them through a 
sieve, and boil them down like other marmalade, 
adding salt. Put them into small jars, pepper the 
tops, and pour clarified butter over. Eat it with 
fish, etc., or stir the contents of a small pot into 
the gravy of stews or fricassees. 

Belsize Tomato Sauce. — Slice tomatoes in a 
jar, and sprinkle salt over every layer of slices, 
place the jar in a warm place by the fire, stir the 
contents pretty often for three days, and let it re- 
main untouched for twelve days. Press out the 
juice, and boil it with mace, pepper, allspice, gin- 
ger, and cloves. There should be two ounces of 



SAUCES AND PICKLES. 51 

spice to a quart of juice, the pepper and allspice 
greatly predominating. At the end of three months 
it should be boiled up with fresh spice. 

Tomato Vinegar. — Quarter three dozen fine 
tomatoes, leave the bottoms undivided ; rub half 
a pound of salt over them, place them in a wide- 
mouthed jar in a cool oven, or by the side of the 
fire, for a day or two ; add a little mace, cloves, 
and grated nutmeg; slice in a clove of garlic, 
sprinkle in half a pint of mustard seed, and pour 
over all two quarts of boiling vinegar ; tie a blad- 
der over the jar, and let it remain five or six days 
more by the fire, shaking it well every day. Put 
it by in the same jar as long as convenient, and 
when you wish to bottle it press out all the liquor ; 
let it stand several hours to clear, and then bottle 
the clear, and keep that which is not quite clear for 
present use. 

Tomato vinegar and tomato sauce should both 
be kept in store, as the sub-acid flavor is sometimes 
an improvement in the dishes in which it is used, 
whereas at other times we require the flavor of the 
tomato unmingled with acid. 

Lemon Pickle. — Grate off the rind of twenty 
lemons, or pare it off so thin as to cut through the 
little globules, grating or cutting it into a small 
quantity of vinegar, to be added to the lemon pickle 
with the vinegar. Cut the lemons in quarters, leav- 
ing the bottoms whole. Rub over them equally 



52 Sx^UCES AND PICKLES. 

half a pound of bay salt, and put them into a stone 
jar in a cool oven, or on the hob by the fire, until the 
juice is dried into the peels. Then put in amongst 
them a blade of mace, a few cloves beaten fine, some 
grated nutmeg, a clove of garlic peeled and sliced, 
and half a pint of mustard seed bruised, and pour 
over all two quarts of boiling vinegar. Close the 
jar well, let it stand in its warm place five or six 
days, shaking it up every day. Tie it down tight 
with a bladder, and put it by for three months to 
take off the bitter. After this it may be bottled 
when convenient. Put all into a hair sieve, and 
squeeze out the liquor. Let the liquor stand until 
the next day, and bottle the fine. Let the remain- 
der stand two days, bottle the fine part, and repeat 
the same until all is bottled. A little will not hurt 
the color of white sauce, and it is capital for flavor- 
ing stews and ragouts, and also makes a very nice 
fish sauce. In using it for flavoring put it in before 
the gravy is thickened, especially if cream be used, 
lest the sharpness should make it curdle. 

Chutney. — Pare and core a quarter of a pound 
of sharp apples, weigh the same quantity of toma- 
toes, raisins, figs, brown sugar, and salt. Pound 
them in a mortar, and pound and mix Math them a 
quarter of an ounce of chilis or Cayenne pepper, the 
same of powdered ginger, half an ounce each of garlic 
and shalots. Mix all well together in a large jar, 
put in three pints of vinegar and one of lemon juice, 
and stand the jar where it will be in heat amounting 



SAUCES AND PICKLES. 53 

to 130° Fahrenheit for a month, stirring it twice a 
day. If sour apples are not to be had, gooseberries 
will do, but not so well. The top liquor or quihi 
may be poured off and bottled. It is an excellent 
fish sauce. The thick part is the chutney, and 
should be put into wide-mouthed bottles. Both 
are excellent for flavoring sauces or gravies, or to 
eat as sauce. 

Browning. — Beat fine four ounces of refined 
sugar, and put it into a very clean frying-pan, with 
one ounce of butter. Mix them together over a clear 
fire, and when the sugar froths in dissolving, hold 
tlie pan a little off the fire, and when the sugar is 
of a deep brown pour in by degrees, little by little, 
and stirring the mixture all the time, a pint of red 
wine. Stir in half an ounce of allspice, six cloves, 
four shalots, peeled, a blade of mace, a wineglass of 
catsup, and the rind of a lemon. Simmer it for ten 
minutes or a quarter of an hour, pour it into a basin 
to get cold, then skim it very clean, and bottle it for 
use. It is good for any brown gravy. Browning 
is often made for present use by burning a good tea- 
spoonful of brown sugar in a large iron spoon. 
Stirred into brown gravy it gives both richness and 
color. Another browning is made by allowing flour 
to bake until it is of one uniform dark-brown color. 
It takes many days, and must be stirred about from 
time to time while doing. 

Mushroom Powder. — Peel the thickest large 



54 SAUCES AND PICKLES. 

buttons you can get, and just pare off the root end, 
but do not wash them. Place them on jDcwter 
dishes, so that their liquor will dry into them, and 
put them into a slow oven until they will powder. 
Beat them up in a mortar, sift the powder through 
a sieve with a little Cayenne pepper and pounded 
mace, bottle it, and keep it in a dry place. 

Fish Sauce. — Take half a pint of milk and cream 
together, two eggs well beaten, salt, a little pepper, 
and the juice of half a lemon. Put it over the fire 
and stir it constantly until it begins to thicken. 

Tomato Sauce. — Take seven pounds of ripe 
tomatoes. Skin them, put them in a preserving 
kettle, with four pounds of sugar, and boil until 
the sugar penetrates the tomatoes ; add one pint of 
vinegar, one ounce of cloves, and one ounce of 
ground cinnamon ; boil thirty minutes, and then 
seal up close in stone jars. This will keep for 
years. 

Mushroom Sauce. — Half a pint of button 
mushrooms, half a pint of good beef gra\y, one 
tablespoonful of mushroom catsup, thickening of 
butter and flour. Put the gravy into a saucepan, 
thicken it, and stir it over the fire until it boils. 
Prepare the mushrooms by cutting off the stalks, 
and wiping them free from grit and dirt; the large, 
flat mushrooms cut into small pieces will answer 
for a sauce, when the buttons are not obtainable. 
Put them into the gravy, and let them simmer very 



SAUCES AND PICKLES. 55 

gently for ten minutes, then add the catsup, and 
serve. When fresh mushrooms are not in season, 
the mushroom powder makes a good sauce for 
roast meats. 

Bread Sauce. — Cut some bread into slices, 
adding to it some pepper, an onion, a little salt and 
butter, and enough boiling milk to cover it. Let 
it simmer gently before the fire, until the whole of 
the milk is soaked up by the bread, then add a 
little thick cream, remove the onion and rub 
through a hair sieve. Serve very hot in a sauce 
tureen. 

Sauce for Fowls. — An excellent white sauce 
for fowls may be made of two ounces of butter, two 
small onions, one carrot, half a teacupful of flour, 
one pint of new milk, salt and pepper to taste. 
Cut up the onions and carrots very small and put 
them into a stewpan with the butter ; simmer them 
until the butter is nearly dried up ; then stir in the 
flour, and add the milk. Boil the whole gently 
until it thickens, strain it, season with salt and 
Cayenne, and serve. 

Sauce for Boiled Poultry. — Chop a stick of 
blanched celery very fine, in a quart of new milk ; 
let it boil gently in a stewpan, with a few black 
pepper-corns till reduced to one pint. Stir till the 
whole is a smooth pulp. Thicken with the yelk 
of a fresh egg well beaten with half a teacupfuJ 
of fresh cream. 



56 SAUCES AND PICKLE.S. 

Savory Sauce for a Roast Goose. — A table- 
spoonful of made mustard, half a teaspoonful of 
Cayenne pepper, and three spoonfuls of port wine. 
When mixed, pour this (hot) into the body of the 
goose before sending it up. It wonderfully improves 
with sage and onions. 

GiBLET Sauce. — Take the livers* lights, gizzards, 
and hearts from fowls. Boil very tender, and 
chop them fine. Make a nice thin drawn-butter, 
and stir them in ; or boil and chop them, and use 
the water in which they were boiled ; season with 
butter, pepper and salt ; beat up the yelks of two 
eggs, add them, and keep the sauce stirring until it 
thickens. This sauce is best for roast fowls. 

Sauce for Wild Duck. — A tablespoonful of 
made mustard, a teaspoonful of essence of anchovies, 
a pinch of Cayenne pepper, a tablespoonful of 
mushroom ketchup, and a wineglass of claret. Mix 
the mustard and anchovy essence thoroughly in a 
saucepan, add the Cayenne, then the ketchup, a 
few drops at a time ; the claret last ; heat over a 
clear fire. Slice the breast of the duck, and pour 
the sauce over it very hot. 

Venison Ravigote Sauce. — Put three pounds 
of venison in a vessel ; set on the fire in a pan one 
pint of vinegar, two bay leaves, two cloves, two 
leaves of garlic, one onion sliced, two stalks of 
thyme, four of parsley, and one dozen pepper-corns. 
Let it boiJ, and turn it over the venison. Leave il 



SAUCES AND PICKLES. 57 

for a day, turning the venison occasionally. Then 
put the venison in a pan with some spices, and 
pour the juice and vinegar back over it, adding 
salt and a few pieces of butter, and bake it. If 
you roast the venison, put the vindgar and spices in 
the dripping pan, and baste with it. For the sauce 
take an onion chopped fine and set on the fire with 
one ounce of butter; when nearly done, add a 
dessertspoonful of flour, one gill and a half of 
broth, and stir. Then add the drippings from the 
venison, and boil gently over a slow fire. The 
ravigote sauce can be used with beef, mutton or 
pork. Keep it on the fire five minutes, add chop- 
ped parsley, and serve. 

Green Mint Sauce. — The French use this 
for boiled lamb. It is made by putting green mint, 
chopped fine, and parsley, in vinegar. 

Sauce Robert. — Cut a few onions into dice, 
which put into a frying-pan with a bit of butter, 
and fry them lightly ; when nicely browned, add a 
dessertspoonful of flour, a ladleful of stock, the 
same of vinegar, some salt and pepper ; reduce it to 
a proper thickness, and when ready for table stir in 
two dessertspoonfuls of mustard. 

Celery Sauce. — Make half a pint of melted 
butter, of course, using only milk or cream, or both 
mixed. Have ready three heads of celery, the 
white parts well washed and cut up into small bits, 
and boiled for a few minutes in water, which strain

off; put the celery to the melted butter, and keep it 
stirred over the fire for ten or twelve minutes. It 
is better to put the celery in before the melted 
butter boils up — as soon as it is hot will do. Thia 
is a very nice sauce for boiled fowl or turkey. 

Horseradish Sauce. — One tablespoonful of 
grated horseradish, one saltspoonful of mustard, a 
pinch of salt, four tablespoonfuls of cream, and 
two tablespoonfuls of white vinegar. Mix well 
together, adding the vinegar last, and stirring 
very rapidly when pouring that on the mixture. 

Potato Sauce. — Smoothly mash one large 
steamed potato when it is hot, and add a little salt, 
shred-lemon peel and white pepper; mix with it 
some dissolved butter, the beaten yelk of a new- 
laid egg, and pour over it enough boiling milk to 
render it sufficiently thin in consistency. Gravy 
instead of milk may be added when a white sauce 
is not wanted, and potato flour, instead of mashed 
potato used when easily procured. Any particular 
flavor may be imparted to this sauce according to 

taste, such as chopped herbs, olives or pickles. 

* 

E-iCE Sauce. — This is a delicate white sauce for 
eating with game or chicken, as a change from the 
usual bread sauce, and is a great deal used in India. 
Soak a quarter of a pound of rice in a pint of milk, 
with onion, pepper, and salt. When it is quite 
tender rub it through a sieve into a s-tewpan, and 
boil it. If too thick, thin with cream or milk.

WiNi: Sauce. — One cup of butter and t'o o cups 
of sugar stirred to a cream ; one cup of wine added 
slowly. Set the bowl in a kettle of hot water three- 
quarters of an hour before you wish to use it. It 
must not be stirred or poured out of the bowl. 

Madeira Sauce. — Two cups of white sugar, 
three-quarters of a cup of butter ; beat to a cream, 
and add by the teaspoonful, a cup of Madeira wine. 
Mix well, place the bowl containing the mixture in 
a vessel of boiling water, and stir to a cream. Serve 
hot. 

Pudding Sauce, No. 1. — Beat to a cream one 
cup of butter with two cups of sugar, one cup of 
wine to be added slowly. Set the bowl it is in in 
a kettle of hot water three-quarters of an hour be- 
fore you wish it for use. It must not be stirred 
before placing on the table, or poured out of the 
bowl. 

Pudding Sauce, No. 2. — Dissolve two cups of 
sugar in a cup of butter, and add a wineglassful of 
wine; beat them well together, and flavor with 
nutmeg or mace to suit the taste. 

Lemon Sauce. — Melt two ounces of butter in a 
little water; put in two ounces of sugar, the juice 
and grated rind of half a lemon, and the pulp and 
juice of the other half. Boil together five minutes, 
and serve hot, for cold puddings. 

Orancje Sauce. — Rub together one ounce of

pan, with the juice of four large oranges, the shred 
rind of half an orange, and two tablespoonfuls of 
loaf sugar. Stir gently over the fire until all ia 
well mixed, and serve. 

Sweet Egg Sauce. — Put the yelks of four 
hard boiled eggs into a mortar, with an equal 
weight of fresh butter and sugar ; beat it smooth, 
then dilute with a sufficiency of either milk or white 
wine. Add the grated rind of half a lemon ; boil 
five minutes, and serve. 

Sweet Pudding Sauce. — Mix with half a pint 
of melted butter tAvo dessertspoonfuls of pounded 
loaf-sugar (with or without a wineglass of sherry), 
make it quite hot, and pour it over and around the 
puddings when they are turned out into the dish. 

PICKLES. 

The general principle of pickling may be soon 
stated, although it is not universally applicable to 
all varieties. The vegetables are in the majority of 
cases placed in strong brine for some hours or days. 
This is done to extract part of the watery fluids they 
contain, for by a law well known to chemists, when 
two liquids are separated by an aninaal or vegetable 
membrane, an interchange takes place; but the 
lighter fluid is more rapidly attracted by the heavier. 
It follows, therefore, that if vegetables are put into 
strong brine, the more fluid parts are extracted, 
and the vegetable becomes less watery than before. 



SAUCES AND TICKLES. Gl 

Great advantage, especially in wholesale manufac- 
ture, is taken of this circumstance, for, instead of 
placing the substances in the first instance, in 
vinegar, which would be so weakened that it would 
have to be renewed at a considerable cost, the vege- 
tables are first pickled in strong brine, and, when 
the water is extracted, they are finally preserved in 
vinegar, and bottled. As an example of this 
method of proceeding we give the following : — 

To Pickle String Beans. — String beans make 
a deservedly popular pickle, but they should not be 
more than half grown when gathered ; have them 
as much of one size as possible, and let a little of 
the stalk remain upon each. Put them into a brine 
strong enough for an egg to float in ; let them stay 
in it for three days, stirring occasionally; place 
them in a preserving pan, with plenty of vine 
leaves both over and under them ; cover them in 
the brine in which they have steeped ; put some- 
thing over them to keep the steam from escaping, 
and set them jver a very slow fire until they 
turn green, but they should not be allowed to 
boil ; drain them in a sieve, and arrange them in a 
jar; pour upon them a pickle made by heating some 
of the best white wine vinegar, which you hSye 
flavored with mace, ginger, and pepper. If the 
beans are already properly greened, the pickle may 
be employed cold, otherwise use it hot. 

It is needless to say that in following out these 



52 SAUCES AND PICKLES. 

directions the vinegar used should not be boiled in 
a copper, but, if possible, in an enamelled pan. 

Sometimes the salt is more advantageously used 
dry, as extracting the moisture of the plant more 
rapidly. The following receipt is an example of 
this mode of procedure: — 

To Pickle Red Cabbage. — Choose a medium- 
sized fresh red cabbage ; tear ofif the coarse outer 
leaves, quarter it, remove the stalk, cut the cabbage 
into slices of about the third of an inch in thick- 
ness ; place it in a bowl, strew amongst it two good 
handfuls of salt ; let the whole stand for twenty- 
four hours ; stirring it once or twice ; drain it as dry 
as possible ; place it loosely in wide-mouthed jars, 
and fill up with either the prepared vinegar given 
above, or use strong raw vinegar, adding pepper- 
corns, capsicums, pieces of ginger, or what other 
spice you may fancy. This in a day or two will 
be of a splendid crimson color, and eat deliciously 
ci'isp. Those cooks who prefer to boil their vine- 
gar and spices in an iron pot, and forthwith pour 
the pickle boiling hot upon the cabbage, may rea- 
sonably expect soon to find the latter limp, ill- 
flavored, and of a dismal purplish blue. 

The caution here given respecting the boiling the 
vinegar in an iron vessel is perfectly correct. For, 
if done, a small quantity of the metal will be dis- 
Bolved by the acid, and, although perfectly whole- 
some, alter materially the fine color which is so 
much esteemed in this pickle. 



SAUCES AND PICKLES. 63 

Pickled Nasturtiums. — Very frequently nas- 
turtiums are merely thrown into seasoned vinegar ; 
they should be gathered in sunshiny weather. Al- 
though this method answers tolerably well, it is 
preferable to put the freshly pickled nasturtiums 
into a strong brine of salt and water, and let them 
remain in this till they grow somewhat soft; then 
cov^er them with strong vinegar, and they will keep 
for years. 

To Pickle Cabbage a Good Color. — Put 
a few slices of beet-root amongst it — will find it 
makes it a very beautiful color, besides being a nice 
addition to the pickles. 

To Pickle Mushrooms. — Rub the buttons with 
flannel and salt, throw them into a stewpan with a 
little salt over them, then sprinkle them with some 
pepper and a small quantity of mace. As the liquor 
comes out shake them well, and keep them over a 
gentle fire until all is dried into them again, then 
put as much vinegar into the pan as will cover them. 
Give it a scald, and pour the whole into bottles. 

Small Onion Pickle. — Small onions, not larger 
than marbles, must be carefully peeled and thrown 
into strong brine. Let them remain eight days, 
changing the brine every other day. Dry in a cloth, 
place them in bottles, add spice, and fill up with 
strong distilled vinegar. A teaspoonful of olive oil 
will prevent the onions from turning yellow. Mus- 
tard seed, horseradish, allspice, cloves, black pep- 
5 



64 SAUCES AND PICKLES. 

per-corns, and mace are all excellent spices for 
onions. 

Spiced Onions. — Peel large onions and lay them 
in a jar. Put as much cider vinegar as will cover 
them in a pot, with cloves, allspice, cinnamon, mace, 
mustard seed, horseradish. When the vinegar boils 
pour it over the onions. Let them stand twelve 
hours. Pour off the vinegar, heat to bailing point, 
and pour on again until the vinegar has been heated 
three times, when the onions will be fit for use. 

Pickled Onions. — Have the onions gathered 
when quite dry and ripe, and with the fingers tiike 
off the thin outside skin, then with a knife remove 
one more skin, when the onion will look quite clear. 
Have ready some very dry bottles or jars, and as 
fast a.s the onions are peeled put them in. Pour 
over sufficient cold vinegar to cover them, add two 
teaspoonfuls of allspice and two teaspoonfuls of black 
pepper, taking care that each jar has its share of the 
latter ingredients. Tie down with bladder, and put 
them in a dry place, and in a fortnight they will be 
fit for use. This is a most simple receipt, and very 
delicious, the onions being nice and crisp. They 
should be eaten within six or eight months after 
being done, as the onions are liable to become soft. 

To Pickle Beet-root, — This vegetable makes 
an excellent pickle, and from the brightness of its 
color has a very pretty effect in a glass pickle dish 
or jar. Wash the beet perfectly. Do not cut off 



SAUCES AND PICKLES. 65 

any of the fibrous roots, as this would allow the 
juice to escape, and thus the coloring would be lost. 
Put it into sufficient water to boil it, and when the 
skin will come off it will be sufficiently cooked, and 
may be taken out and laid upon a cloth to cooK 
Having rubbed off the skin cut the beet into thick 
slices, put it into a jar, and pour over it cold vine- 
gar, prepared as follows : Boil a quart of vinegar 
with one ounce of whole black pepper, and an equal 
weight of dry ginger, and let it stand until quite 
cold. The jar should be kept closely corked. 

Carolina Chow-Chow. — The evening before 
you wish to make your pickle take the cabbage, 
chop it up fine, say a water-pailful, put a layer of 
cabbage, sprinkle with salt, and so on until the ves- 
sel is full, place a plate on it to press it down, and 
let it stand until morning. Prepare ten large onions 
in the same way, spread the cabbage on a cloth, and 
let it remain while you are preparing your vinegar. 
Take one gallon of the best vinegar and swSeteu to 
your taste, put into a bowl some mustard, two 
ounces of pulverized cinnamon, two ounces of tur- 
meric, two ounces of white mustard seed, two ounces 
of celery seed, half a pint of grated horseradish, 
mix all well together in the vinegar, and let it come 
to a boil, then put in the cabbage and onions and 
let them boil about ten minutes. If too thick add 
vinegar. You can use salad oil, half a teacupful, 
if you like it, and other spices.

Pickle Chow-Chow. — A quarter of a peck of 
green tomatoes, a quarter of a peck of white (uiions, 
a quarter of a peck of pickling beans, one dozen 
green cucumbers, one dozen green peppers, one large 
head of cabbage. Season with mustard, celery seed, 
salt, to suit the taste. Cover the mixture with the 
best vinegar. Boil two hours slowly, continually 
stirring, and add two tablespoonfuls of salad oil 
while hot. 

Chow-Chow. — (Excellent.) — To one peck of 
green tomatoes add three good sized onions, six pep- 
pers with the seeds taken out. Chop together and 
boil three minutes in three quarts of vinegar. Throw 
this vinegar away after straining. Then to three 
quarts of new vinegar, when scalding hot, add two 
cups of sugar, one cup of mixed mustard, one table- 
spoonful of cloves, one of allspice, two of cinnamon, 
three of salt. Pour over the tomatoes hot. 

Old Virginia Chow-Chow. — Three pecks of 
ripe tomatoes, three of green tomatoes, five large 
heads of cabbage, one dozen large onions, one dozen 
ripe peppers, one dozen green peppers, half a pound 
of celery. Chop all very fine, cover with salt, and 
soak twenty-four hours. Then drain the brine off, 
thoroughly cover with strong vinegar, and add three 
pounds of sugar. Scald one hour, add one cup of 
grated horseradish, two tablespoonfuls of white 
mustard seed, one of cloves, two of allspice, two of 
ginger, and one of ground mustard. Cover close 
for one month, when it will be ready for use.

India Pickle. — Quarter of a pound of ginger, 
half an ounce of ground cloves, half an ounce of chil- 
lies, four ounces of black pepper, two of ground all- 
spice, four of coarse salt, two of garlic, two of escha- 
lots, quarter of a pound of mustard seed, and a small 
piece of alum, all put into two gallons of pure cider 
or white wine vinegar, and boiled half an hour. 
Mix half a pound of mustard and quarter of a pound 
of tannin, smoothe with a little vinegar, and add to 
the above pickle. Let it just come to a boil, then 
pour into a deep jar. Put into this pickle all vege- 
tables as they come in their season, being careful to 
have them well dried. Let them remain in the 
pickle three weeks, then bottle for use. This will 
keep perfectly good three years. 

Yellow Pickle. — Have firm white cabbages 
cut in quarters ; put into strong brine for two or 
three days; then scald them in clear water until 
you can run a straw in them ; take them out and 
dry them for twenty-four hours in the sun, or by 
the stove, as may be most convenient; tKen put 
them in strong cider vinegar, with powdered tur- 
meric sufficient to color the cabbage, and let them 
remain in the vinegar about ten days. White 
onions managed the same way ; also lemons whole. 
Cucumbers — white are the best — must not be 
scalded or dried, but only changed from the brine 
to the vinegar colored with the turmeric. After re- 
maining in the turmeric vinegar ten or twelve days, 
take the fruit and vegetables out of it, and put

them in a sieve or on a plank, and let all the vine- 
gar drain from them for two or three hours. Have 
the following spices, etc., prepared ready, and pack 
them in a jar, a layer of fruit and vegetables and a 
layer of spices until the jar is three parts full ; then 
fill up with vinegar — cider vinegar; after a day or 
two pour the vinegar from them, scald it, and to 
every gallon of vinegar add five pounds of sugar 
while the vinegar is boiling. Be sure to keep the 
pickle covered with the vinegar. For each gallon 
of pickle, three ounces of turmeric, two ounces of 
white ginger, two ounces of white pepper, quarter 
of an ounce of mace beaten fine, four ounces of 
horseradish shredded fine, four ounces of garlic, 
two ounces of white mustard seed, half an ounce 
of celery seed, whole. The pickle should have a 
tight cover at all times, and, during the warm 
weather, be frequently placed in the sun. 

Pickled Red Cabbage. — Cut the red cabbage 
In thin slices, spread it on a sieve and sprinkle with 
salt. Let it drain for twenty-four hours, dry it, 
pack it in pickle jars, fill them with cold vinegar, 
put in spice to taste, and tie the jars up firmly with 
bladder. Open the jars in a few days, and if the 
cabbage has shrunk, fill up with vinegar. 

Artichokes Pickled. — Boil the artichokes till 
you can pull the leaves off; take out the choke and 
cut away the stalk, but be careful that the knife 
does not touch the top ; throw them into salt and 



SAUCES AND PICKLES, . 69 

water. When they have lain an hour, take them 
out and drain them ; then put them into glasses or 
jars, and put a little mace and sliced nutmeg be- 
tween ; fill them with vinegar and spring water, 
and cover your jars close. 

Gherkijts. — Steep them in strong brine for a 
w(H*k, then pour it off; heat it to the boiling point, 
and again pour it on the gherkins. In twenty-four 
hours drain the fruit on a sieve ; put it in wide- 
mouthed bottles or jars ', fill them up with strong 
pickling vinegar, boiling hot, bung them down at 
once and tie them over with bladder. When cold, 
dip the corks into melted bottle- wax. Spice is 
usually added to the bottles, or else steeped in the 
vinegar. 

To Make Lemon Pickle. — Take some lemons 
and grate them slightly; cut them down at one end 
in four places, which fill up with salt; lay them at 
the bottom of a jar, and strew over them horse- 
radish, (shred,) pepper, garlic, bruised ginger, Cay- 
enne, a little turmeric, or, if preferred, half a spoon- 
ful of curry powder, and plenty of mustard seed ; 
then add some more lemons again, and so on with 
the different ingredients until the lemons are all in 
the jar. Pour over some strong cold vinegar, as much 
afi will cover the pickle; tie the jar over with a 
bladder, and F,et it in a })an of water. Let it boil 
slowly until the lemons l>ecome tender. The 
pickles will he fit for use in less than a week, if 
required. 



70 SAUCES AND PICKLES. 

Tomato Catsup, No. 1. — Scald ripe tomatoes, 
and remove the skin. Let them stand a day, 
covered with salt ; strain thoroughly to remove the 
seeds. To every two quarts of the liquor add three 
ounces of cloves, two of black pepper, two grated 
nutmegs, a little Cayenne pepper, and salt. Boil 
all together for half an hour, then let the mixture 
cool and settle ; add a pint of the best cider vine- 
gar ; bottle, cork tightly, and seal. Keep in a cool 
place. 

Tomato Catsup, No. 2. — Boil one bushel of 
ripe tomatoes until |)ei*fectly soft,; squeeze them 
through a fine wire sieve, add half a gallon of 
vinegar, one pint and a half of salt, two ounces of 
cloves, quarter of a pound of allspice, two ounces 
of Cayenne jx'pper, three teaspoonfuls of black 
pepper, five heads of garlic, skinned and separated. 
Mix together, and boil three hours ; it should re- 
duce to one-half. Bottle without straining. 

To^f ato Sov. — To one jxx-k of green tomatoes, 
sliced thin, add one pint of salt; stand twenty-four 
hours, strain, and put on the fire v/ith twelve raw 
onions, an ounce of black pepper, one ounce of all- 
spice, quarter of a jiound of ground mustard, half 
a pound of wfiite nuistartl seed, and a little Cayenne 
pepper. Cover Avith vinegar and boil till as thick 
as a jam, stirring o(X'asionaIly with a wooden spoon, 
to prevent burning. 

KiPE Cucumber Pickle. — Pare them, take out 



SAUCES AND PICKI.ES. 71 

the seeih, cut in rings an inch thick; then simmer 
in weak alum water an hour; take them out, drain 
tliem, and lay them carefully in ajar; then prepare 
a syrup of one gallon good vinegar, two cups sugar, 
one ounce cinnamon, one ounce ginger-root ; pour 
it hot over your pickles. This is a delightful pickle, 
anil will keep sealed up a long time. 

Green Cucumber Pickle. — Make a brine by 
putting one pint of rock-salt into a pail of boiling 
water, and pour it over the cucumbers ; cover tight 
to keep in the steam, and let them remain all night 
and part of a day ; make a second brine as above, 
and let them remain in it the same length of time ; 
then scald and skim the brine, as it will answer lor 
the third brine, and let them remain in it as above; 
then rinse and wipe them dry, and add boiling hot 
vinegar; throw in a lump of alum as large as a 
nut to every pail of pickles, and you will have a 
fine, hard, and green pickle. Add spices, if you 
like, and keep the pickles under the vinegar. A 
brick on the top of the cover, which keeps the 
pickles under, has a tendency to collect the scum 
which may arise. 

Pickled Eggs, No. 1. — ^Obtain a moderate-sized, 
wide-mouthed earthen jar, sufficient to hold one 
dozen eggs ; let the latter be boiled quite hard ; 
when fully done, place the same, after taking them 
up, into a pan of cold water. Remove the sheila 
from them, and deposit them carefully in the jar. 



72 SAUCES AND PICKLES. 

Have on the fire a quart (or more, if necessary) of 
good white wine vinegar, into which introduce one 
ounce of raw ginger, two or three blades of sweet 
mace, one ounce of allspice, half an ounce of whole 
black pepper, and salt, half an ounce of mustard 
seed, with four cloves of garlic. When it has sim- 
mered for half an hour take it up, and pour the 
contents into the jar, taking care to observe that the 
eggs are wholly covered. When quite cold, stopper 
it down for use. It Avill be ready after a month. 
When cut into quarters, they serve as a garnish, and 
afford a nice relish to cold meat of any kind. 

Pickled Eggs, No. 2. — Boil two or three dozen 
eggs for half an hour, then, after removing the 
shells, lay them carefully in large-mouthed jars, 
and pour over them scalding vinegar, well seasoned 
with whole pepper, allspice, a few races of ginger, 
and a few cloves of garlic. When cold, they are 
bunged down close, and in a month are fit for use. 
Where eggs are plentiful, the above pickle is by no 
means expensive, and, as an accompaniment to 
cold meat, it cannot be outrivalled for piquancy 
md gout. 

Piccalilli. — Take anything that can be j>ickled, 
su«h as onions, sliced cucumbers, cabbage, mangoes, 
peppers, squashes, small green tomatoes, cauliflowers, 
martenoes, celery, green beans, ntisturtiums, radish 
pods, watermelon rinds, small green cucumbers, and 
Chili peppers. Lay them in salt and water, with 



SAUCES AND PICKLES. 73 

enough turmeric to turn them yellow. Let them 
stand twenty-four hours, stirring frequently ; then 
drain, and dry them and put them into the jars. 
To every quart of vinegar, allow a tablespoonful 
of mustard seed, one of turmeric, and a handful of 
whole black pepper, one clove of garlic. Spice to 
your taste with mace, ginger, cloves, red pepper, 
and horseradish. Boil all but the mustard seed in 
a bag in the vinegar. Let the vinegar stand till 
cold. Boil one dozen eggs quite hard, mash them 
in enough sweet oil to make a paste ; then stir it in 
the vinegar, which pour over the pickles. Put 
one handful of salt in every jar. They should 
stand three days, well tied up, when they will be 
fit for use. 

Pickled Walnuts, No. 1. — One hundred wal- 
nuts, salt and water. To each quart of vinegar 
allow two ounces of whole black pepper, one ounce 
of allspice, one ounce of bruised ginger. Procure 
the walnuts while young, and prick them well with 
a fork. Prepare a strong brine of salt and water 
(four pounds of salt to each gallon of water), into 
which put the walnuts, letting them remain nine 
days, and changing the brine every third day. Drain 
them off, put them on a dish, and place it in the 
sun until they become perfectly black, which will be 
in two or three days. Have ready dry jars, into 
which place the walnuts, and do not quite fill the 
jars. Boil sufficient vinegar to cover them for ten 
minutes, with spices in the above proportion, and 



74 SAUCES AND PICKLES. 

pour it hot over the walnuts, which must be quite 
covered with the pickle. Tie down with bladder 
and keep in a dry place. They will be fit for use 
In a month, and will keep good two or three years. 

Pickled AValnuts, No. 2. — Take one hundred 
walnuts, soft enough to allow a needle to pass 
through them, lay them in water, with a good hand- 
ful of salt, for two days, then change to fresh water 
and another handful of salt, for three days, then 
drain and lay them on some clean straw or a sieve 
in the sun until quite black and wrinkled ; after- 
wards put into a clean, dry glass bottle or jar a quar- 
ter of an ounce of allspice, quarter of an ounce of 
mace, quarter of an ounce of ginger, half a pint of 
mustard seed, and half an ounce of pepper-corns ; 
these to be mixed in layers with the walnuts until 
your Avalnuts are all used, then pour over them boil- 
ing vinegar to cover them. Ready for use in two 
months. 

Sweet Peach Pickles. — To nine pounds of firm 
clingstone peaches (peeled) take three pounds of 
brown sugar and an ounce each of cinnamon bark, 
cloves, mace, and allspice, and a quart of good vine- 
gar. Put the sugar, vinegar, and spices in a clean 
preserving kettle, and let it boil thoroughly. Have 
the peaches in a large jar, and when the vinegar, 
sugar, and spices have been skimmed, and while 
boiling, pour over the peaches. Do this for nine 
consecutiye days, pouring off the liquid every morn- 



SAUCES AND PICKLES 75 

ing, and boiling again and scalding the peaches. 
Tie and put in a cool place. 

Sweet Pickle. — Select fine cantaloupe or citron 
melons, ripe, but firm, pare and seed them, and sh'ce 
or quarter them. Weigh the fruit, and to five 
pounds of melon allow two and a half pounds of 
white sugar and one quart of vinegar. The vinegar 
and sugar must be heated, well skimmed, and poured 
boiling over the fruit six times. In the last boiling 
of the syrup add the spices — stick cinnamon, white 
ginger, and a few cloves — and when the syrup boils 
put in the citron and let it boil for ten minutes, then 
put it in the jars, skim the syrup clear, and pour 
over it. 

Sweet Tomato Pickles. — Chop one peck of 
green tomatoes, four onions, and six green peppers. 
Strew over ^lem one cup of salt, and let them 
stand all night. Next day drain off the water from 
them, and add to them one cup»of sugar (or more, 
if liked), one cup of grated horseradish, one table- 
spoonful of cinnamon, one of cloves, and one of 
allspice. Cover with vinegar and cook till tender. 

Geeen Tomato Pickle. — Slice two gallons of 
green tomatoes, put them into a pan with a layer 
of salt, and then of tomatoes, with half a dozen of 
onions sliced, and alternately put with the toma- 
toes and salt, and let them remain in salt all night. 
The next morning rinse and drain well. Put them 
into a kettle with one gallon of strong cider vij»*»- 



76 SAUCES AND PICKLES 

gar, half a gallon of brown sugar, four tablespooii- 
fuls of mustard, four of ground allspice, four of 
ground ginger, five of cinnamon, four of cloves, 
four of black pepper, four of celery seed, half a 
dozen red or green peppers, sliced fine, two teaspoon- 
fuls of ground mace, and four tablespoonfuls of olive 
oil. Let it boil three or four hours, then, if the 
vinegar is not as strong as it should have been, 
while the pickles are still warm, add a quart of cold 
vinegar. This pickle has been considered as good 
as " chow chow," and will keep for years. 

Tomatoes. — Always use those which are thor- 
oughly ripe. The small round ones are decidedly 
the best. Do not prick them, as most receipt books 
direct. Let them lie in strong brine three or four 
days, then put them down in layers in your jars, 
mixing with them small onions and pieces of horse- 
radish, then pour on the vinegar (cold), which should 
be first spiced as fqr peppers. Let there be a spice 
bag to throw into every pot. Cover them carefully, 
and set them by in the cellar for a full month before 
using. 

Spiced Tomatoes. — Two pounds of tomatoes, 
one pound of brown sugar, half a pint of good cider 
vinegar, one dozen cloves, and two dozen grains of 
allspice. Put these ingredients into a preserving 
Kettle, and stew them over a slow fire. When they 
have been in sufiiciently long to cook the tomatoes 
tolerably well take them up and place them on a 



SAUCES AND PICKLES. 77 

dish to coo], but continue slowly boiling the syrup. 
When the tomatoes become cool put them back into 
the syrup and boil them until they are of a dark red 
color ; then take them out again, put them on a dish 
to cool, and continue boiling the syrup until it is as 
thick as molasses. When the tomatoes and syrup 
are both cool put it into jars and tie paper over the 
mouths. 

INIixED Pickle. — To each gallon of vinegar allow 
quarter pound of bruised ginger, quarter pound of 
mustard, quarter pound of salt, two ounces of mus- 
tard seed, one and a half ounce of turmeric, one 
ounce of ground -black pepper, quarter ounce of 
Cayenne, cauliflowers, onions, celery, sliced cucum- 
bers, gherkins, French beans, nasturtiums, capsi- 
cums. Have a large jar, with a tightly fitting lid, in 
which put as much vinegar as is required, reserving 
a little to mix the various powders to a smooth 
paste. Put into a basin the mustard, turmeric, pep- 
per, and Cayenne. Mix them with vinegar, and 
stir well until no lumps remain ; add all the ingre- 
dients to the vinegar, and mix well. Keep this 
liquor in a warm place, and thoroughly stir every 
morning for a month with a wooden spoon, when Jt 
will be ready for the different vegetables to be added 
to it. As these come into season have them gath 
ered on a dry day, and, after merely wiping them 
with a cloth to free them from moisture, put them 
into the pickle. The cauliflov/ers, it may be said, 
must be divided into small bunches. Put all these 



78 SAUCES AND PICKLES 

into the pickle raw, and at the end of the season, 
when there have been added as many of" tiie vegeta- 
bles as could be procured, store it away in jars, and 
tie over witii bladder. As none "of the ingredients 
are boiled, this pickle will not be fit to eat till twelve 
months have elapsed. Whilst the pickle is being 
made, keep a wooden spoon tied to the jar ; and its 
contents, it may be re^icated, must be stirred every 
morning. 

Cold Catsup. — One half peck of tomatoes, one 
half gallon of vinegar, half a teacup of salt, half a 
teacup of mustard seed, ground or broken, four pods 
of red pepper, cut very fine, one teacup of grated 
horseradish, two tablespoonfuls of ground pepper, 
two tablespoonfuls of celery seed. After peeling and 
mashing up the tomatoes the whole must be well 
mixed, put into bottles, and corked tightly. It is 
soon ready for. use. 

Pepper Catsup. — Fifty pods of large red pep- 
pers, with the seeds. Add a pint of vinegar, and 
boil until the pulp will mash through a sieve. Add 
to the pulp a second pint of vinegar, two spoonfuls 
of sugar, cloves, mace, spice, onions, and salt. Put 
all in a kettle and boil to a proper consistency. 



CHAPTER IV. 

MEATS. 

Stewed Beef. — A rump of ten pounds weight 
will require three hours' stowing. At first, it may 
be slowly but partly boiled, after which it is to 
sinnner very slowly indeed. Have a saucepan, not 
over large, for the meat, and, at the bottom, fix two 
skewers, to prevent the meat touching the pan. 
Pour over it one pint and. a half of cold water at 
the sides, two or three onions — if not very large — 
partly in pieces, and on the top put as many carrots 
as you may wish, cut into good-sized dice. Before 
dishing the meat, you must thicken the gravy as 
usual with flour and a little burnt sugar, to make 
the gravy (of which there should be a good deal) 
brown. 

Rump of Beef. — This is one of the most juicy 
of all the joints of beef, but is more frequently ste^\'ed 
than roasted. As it is generally too large to serve 
whole, cut as much from the chump end as will 
make a handsome roast. Manage it as the sirloin. 
When boned, roll it into the form of a fillet of veal, 
and bake. 

Spanish Steak. — Cut some onions veuy fine 
a 79 



80 MEATS. 

and put into a frying pan witli plenty of butter, 
boiling hot. When fried quite tender, push to the 
back of the pan. Season a tender loin of beef with 
pe])per and salt, put it on the pan, and (,'ook till 
done. Put the onions over it, and pour in the pan 
sufficient boiling water to make a rich gravy. Let 
all stew five minutes, and serve. 

Beef Stewed with Onions. — Cut some tender 
beef into small pieces, and season ^vith jx^pper and 
salt ; slice some onions and add to it, witli water 
enough in the stewpan to make a gravy. Ijet it 
stew slowly till the beef is thoroughly cooked, then 
add some pieces of butter rolled in flour, enougli to 
make a rich gravy. Cold beef may be cooked in 
the same way, but the onions must then be cooked 
before adding them to the meat. Add more water 
if it dries too fast, but let it be boiling, when 
poured in. 

Brisket of Beef Stuffed. — A piece weigh- 
ing eight pounds requires about five or six hours to 
boil. Make a dressing of bread crumbs, ix!p]xjr, 
salt, sweet herbs, a little mace, and one onion 
choj)ped fine and mixed with an egg. Put the 
dressing between tlie fat and the lean of the beef, 
and sew it up tightly ; flour a cloth, pin the beef in 
it, as closely pressetl as possible, and l)oil five or six 
hours, Remove the cloth, and press the meat until 
it is cold. Cut in thin slices, and eat cold. Ex- 
cellent for sandwiches. 

A LA MODE Beef. — Prepare a drcssing with 



MEATS. 81 

bread or crackers, moisten with water seasoned 
witli butter, pepper, salt, nutmeg, cloves, and, if 
relished, allspice ; add two eggs, and mix the whole 
well together. Have ready a round of beef of the 
proper size for the family ; cut gashes in it, and fill 
them with the dressing. Bind it together with 
skewers, and put it in a bake-pan with water 
enough to cover the bottom of the pan, in which is 
dissolved a little salt. Baste it three or four times 
with the salted water while cooking. Let it stew 
gently. When nearly done, cover it with dressing 
reserved for the purpose. Heat the lid to the pan 
sufficiently hot to brown it, cover and stew until 
done. It can be stewed in a dripping-pan, in a 
stove-oven, and browned when done by holding 
over it, if not already browned, a heated shovel. 
The dressing should be poured over it half an hour 
before taking it from the pan. 

Beef Cutlets. — Cut the inside of a sirloin or 
rump in slices half an inch thick; trim them neatly; 
melt a little butter in a frying-[)an ; season the cut- 
lets ; fry them lightly ; serve with tomato sauce. 

Fillet of Beef with Mushrooms. — Cut tho 
fillet into slices, and pour over them some melted 
butter, seasoned with pepper and salt; let them 
stand for an hour; then put them in a frying pan 
over a quick fire, to brown lightly ; take them out, 
and put in the pan flour enough to thicken and 
brown, mix smoothly, add some stock, and some 



82 MEATS. 

mushrooms half stewed or parboiled ; put the fillet 
back and cook all together till done. When ready 
to serve, squeeze in the juice of a lemon. The 
gravy should be smooth and thick. 

This dish is good substituting tomatoes for mush- 
rooms, and may be varied by using wine instead of 
lemon-juice. 

Fillet of Beef. — Take the sirloin or second 
cut of the ribs ; take out the bones with a sharp 
knife, skewer it round in good shape; lay the bones 
in a large saucepan, with two ouions, one carrot and 
a dozen cloves; add the meat, just covered with 
water. Let it cook slowly two hours; dish the 
meat ; skim all the fat from the gravy, add some 
flour mixed with cold water, aud two spoonfuls of 
walnut catsup ; give all one boil. Turn part of the 
gravy over the meat, and serve the rest in a gravy 
tureen. 

English Beef Pie. — Cut cold roast beef, or 
beefsteak into thin slices, and put a layer in a deep 
pie dish; shake in a little flour, pepper and salt; 
chop a tomato or an onion very fine, and spread on 
this. Another layer of beef and seasoning, another 
onion, and so on, until the dish is filled. Add beef 
gravy, or dripping, and water sufficient to make a 
gravy. Mash one dozen large potatoes, with half 
a teacup of milk or cream, and a little butter and 
salt. Spread this over the beef as a crust, an 
inch thick. Brush with beaten egg, and bake 
half an hour. 



MEATS. 83 

Beefsteak Pie. — Cover the bottom of a deep 
plate with paste. Cut the beef in pieces convenient 
for the month ; spread them evenly over the paste ; 
then add butter, flour, pepper, salt and water; 
cover with paste, press the edges firmly, and cut a 
gash in the centre of the pie ; it is good cold or hot. 
If to be used cold, make a gravy by boiling a bit 
of the bone, seasoning it the same as the pie ; heat 
the gravy, and serve it with the pie. Potatoes are 
all the vegetables needed — they should be mashed. 
These pies can be made from cold beefsteak left the 
day before, but are not quite as good. 

Beefsteak Pudding. — Prepare a good suet 
crust, and line a cake tin with it ; put in layers of 
raw steak, with onions, tomatoes and mushrooms, 
chopped fine, a seasoning of pepper, salt and 
Cayenne, and half a cup of cold water. Cover with 
crust, and bake two hours. Serve very hot. 

Beefsteak Smothered with Onions. — Cut 
up six onions very fine , put them into a saucepan 
with two cupfuls of hot water, about two ounces of 
good butter, some pepper and salt; dredge in a 
little flour. Let it stew until the onions are quite 
soft ; then have the steak broiled ; put it into the 
saucepan with the onions ; let it simmer about ten 
minutes, and send to the table very hot. 

Minced Beef. — Take the lean of some cold 
roast beef. Chop it very fine, adding a small 



84 MEA'lS. 

mincp'^ onion ; and season it with pepper and salt. 
Put it into a stewpan, with some of the gravy that 
has been left from the day before, and let it stew for 
a quarter of an hour. Then put it (two-thirds full) 
into a deep dish. Fill up the dish with mashed 
potatoes, heaped high in the centre, smoothed on the 
surface, and browned witli a salamander or a red- 
hot shovel. 

Beef Balls. — Mince very finely a piece of tender 
beef, fat and lean ; mince an onion, with some 
boiled parsley ; add grated bread crumbs, and 
season with pepper, salt, grated nutmeg, and lemon 
peel ; mix all together, and moisten with a well- 
beaten egg ; roll into balls ; flour, and fry them in 
boiling beef dripping. Serve with fried bread 
crumbs, or a thickened beef gravy. 

Mock Venison of Corned Beef. — Cut tho 
l)eef in thin slices, and freshen by soalcing for three 
or four hours in tepid water. When sufficiently 
fresh, lay the slices on a gridiron, and heat through 
quickly. Make a gravy of drawn butter; add a 
little pepper, and the yelk of an egg chopped fine, 
and pour over the meat ; or butter, pepper and salt, 
like beefsteak. This will be found a savory dish 
when only salt meat can be procured, but is better 
with fresh beef. 

Hash Balls of Corned Beef. — Prepare the 
hash by mincing with potatoes ; make it into flat 



MEATS. 85 

cakes ; heat the gi'iddle, and grease it with plenty 
of sweet butter ; brown the balls first on one side, 
and then on the other, and serve hot. 

Yorkshire Puddixg, with Roast Beef. — 
Five tablespoonfuls of flour mixed with one of 
salt, one pint of milk, and three well-beaten eggs. 
Butter a square pan, and put the batter in it ; set it 
in the oven until it rises and is slightly crusted on 
top ; then place it under your beef roasting before the 
fire, or in the oven, and baste it as you do your meat. 

Corned Beef, Boiled. — Wash it thoroughly, 
and put it in a pot that will hold plenty of water. 
The water should boil when the beef is put in, and 
great care should be taken to skim it often. Half 
an hour for every pound of meat is sufficient time. 
Corn beef, to be tender and juicy, should boil very 
gently and long. If it is to be eaten cold, take it 
from the pot when boiled, and lay it in an earthen 
dish or pan, with a piece of board upon it, the size 
of the meat. Upon this put a heavy stone or 
couple of flat irons. It greatly improves salt meat 
to press it. 

Corned Beef Hash. — The best hash is made 
from boiled corned beef. It should be boiled very 
tender, and chopped fine Avhen entirely cold. The 
potatoes for hash made of corned beef are the better 
for being boiled in the pot liquor. When taken 
from the pot, remove the skins from the potatoes, 
and when cold chop them fine. To a cup of 



86 >IEATS. 

cliopped meat allow four of chopped potatoes ; stir 
the potatoes gradually into the meat, until the 
whole is mixed. Do tliis at evening, and, if warm, 
set the hash in a cool place. In the morning put 
tlie pan on the fire with a lump of butter as large 
as the bowl of a tablespoon ; add a dust of pepper, 
and if not sufficiently salt, add a little; usually none 
is needed. When the butter has melted, put the 
hash in the pan ; add four tablespoons of water, 
and stir the whole together. After it has become 
really hot, stir it from the bottom, cover a plate 
over it, and set the pan where it will merely stew. 
This is a moist hash, and preferred by some to dry 
or browned hash. 

Pickling Beef. — Rub a quarter of a pound 
of saltpetre and a little brown sugar on the beef; 
the following day season it Avith half a pound of 
bay salt, one ounce of black pepper, one ounce of 
allspice. Let the beef lie in pickle fourteen days, 
turning it every day, adding a little common salt 
three times per week ; then wash it, and put it into 
a glazed earthen pipkin, deep enough to cover it. 
Lay beef suet under it; add one pint of water, cover 
the top with paste and then paper, or with a plate 
instead of paste. Bake seven hours in an oven ; 
pour off the liquor, but do not cut till cold. Will 
keep three months. 

Potted Ox-Toxgue. — Broil tender and un- 
smoked tongue of good flavor, and the following 



MEATS. 87 

flay cut from it the quantity desired fjr potting, or 
take for this purpose the remains of one which has 
already been served at table. Trim uif the skin and 
rind, weigh the meat, mince it \ery small, then 
pound it as fine as possible, with four ounces of but- 
ter to each pound of tongue, a small teaspoonful of 
mace, half as much of nutmeg or cloves, and a 
tolerably high seasoning of Cayenne. After the 
spices are well beaten with the meat, ta'tc it, and 
add more if required. A few ounces of ajiy well- 
roasted meat mixed with the tongue, will give it 
firmness. The breasts of turkeys, fowls, partridges, 
or pheasants may be used for this purpose with 
good effect. 

Tongue Toast. — Take coM tongue that hag 
been well boiled, mince it fine, mix it with cream, 
or a little milk, if there is no cream at hand; add 
the beaten yelk of an egg, and give it a simmer 
over the fire. Toast nicely some thin slices of stale 
bread, and having buttered them, lay them in a 
flat dish that has been heated before the fire ; then 
cover each slice with the tongue mixture, which 
should be kept quite hot, and serve up imme- 
diately. 

Tongue, after it han been boiled, cut into thick 
slices, and stewed in a rich, brown gravy, makes a 
very nice corner-dish. 

Spiced Tkipe. — Take fresh tripe, cut it up in 
pieces four or five inches square ; take an earthen 



88 MEATS. 

jar, put in a layer of tripe, then sprinkle a few 
cloves, allspice, and peppers (whole) over it ; then 
another layer of tripe, then spice, and so on till the 
jar is full ; take good vinegar, scald it, pour over 
it, filling the jar full ; cover it up and stand it away 
in a cool place for a few days, until it tastes of the 
spice, then serve it up cold for supper or any other 
meal. It is an excellent relish. 

Potted Beef. — Salt three pounds of lean beef, 
with half a pound of salt, and half an ounce of salt- 
petre. Let it stand three days. Divide it into 
pieces weighing a pound each, and ])ut it in an 
earthen pan of just sufficient size to contain it; pour 
over it half a pint of water, cover it close with 
paste, and set it in a slow oven for four hours. 
When taken from the oven, pour the gravy into 
a basin, shred the meat fine, moisten it with the 
gravy poured from the meat, and pound it thor- 
oughly in a marble mortar, with fresh butter, until 
it becomes a fine paste ; season it with black pepper 
and allspice, ground cloves, or grated nutmeg ; put 
it in pots, press it down as closely as possible, put a 
weight on it, and let it stand all night; next day, 
cover it a quarter of an inch thick with clarified 
butter, and tie paper over it. 

Bubble and Squeak. — Take from a Vound of 
cold, boiled beef, one pound and a half of meat cut 
in thin slices, two carrots which have been boiled 
with tJie meat, cold, and the hearts of two boiled 



I MEATS. 89 

greens, cold. Cut the meat into small squares, and 
chop the vegetables together ; pepper and salt the 
whole, and fry in a pan with a quarter of a pound 
of sweet butter. When fully cooked, toss into the 
pan half a gill of catsup, and serve, with mashed 
potatoes. 

Beef Cakes, No. 1 . — Pound some beef that is 
under-done with a* little fat bacon or ham ; season 
with pepper, salt, and a little shallot or garlic ; mix 
them well, and make into small cakes three inches 
long, and half as wide and thick ; fry them a light 
brown, and serve them in a good thick gravy. 

Beef Cakes, No. 2. — Take the best sirloin of 
beef, one pound; boil it until soft; boil also a 
beef tongue until soft. Take one pound of 
tongue, chop it and the sirloin very fine, with 
quarter of a pound of suet, and quarter of a ]jound 
of raisins. After you have made them as fine as 
you can, add pepper and salt to taste, also one 
teaspoonful of cloves, one teaspoonful of allspice, 
one onion chopped fine, one tablespoonful of flour. 
Mix all well together, form into cakes, and fry in 
butter. 

Beef Croquettes. — Mince some dressed beef 
very fine ; melt a piece of butter in a stewpan, add 
three or four onions chopped fine, and fried a light 
brown ; add a spoonful of flour, and moisten with 
gravy or stock, season with pepper, salt, nutmeg 
and chopped parsley. When the sauce is cooked, 



90 MEATS. 

put in the minced beef, stew ten minutes, or till 
the sauce is dry, form the meat into balls, dip each 
into beaten white of egg. Have some lard and 
butter hot, but not boiling or the balls will break. 
Put each ball gently into the frying-pan, shaking a 
little flour over them; roll them about gently in 
the pan, to brown evenly, and when a good color, 
drain and serve on dressed parSley. 

To Roll Loin of Mutton. — Hang the mutton 
till tender, bone it, and lay a seasoning of pepper, 
allspice, mace, nutmeg, and a few cloves, all in fine 
powder over it. Next day prepare a stuffing ; 
beat the meat, and cover it with the stuffing ; roll 
it up tight and tie it. Half bake it in a slow oven; 
let it grow cold ; take off the fat, and put the gravy 
into a stewpan ; flour the meat, and put it in like- 
wise; stew it till almost ready ; and add a glass of 
port-wine, some catsup, and a little lemon pickle 
half an hour before serving ; serve it in the gravy, 
with jelly sauce. 

Panned Mutton. — Remove all the fat from 
mutton cutlets, and trim neatly. Set them in 
melted butter, luke-warm, with pepper and salt 
Dip each into beaten yelk of egg, and afterwards 
in grated bread crumbs. Repeat the dipping till 
the cutlets are well covered with crumbs. Broil 
on a gridiron over a clear fire for ten minutes. 
Serve plain or with sauce, as preferred. 

Mutton Cutlets. — The most economical way 



MEATS. 91 

of proceeding is to purchase a piece of the best end 
of a neck of mutton and divide and trim your 
chops at home. Every particle of gristle and 
almost all the fat should be removed from each 
cutlet, the bone or rib should not be more than 
two inches long, from the cutlet itself or "nut," and 
it should be scraped quite clean. Saw the bone at 
the end, as it looks badly chopped. Cut the meat 
about one-third of an inch thick, prepare neatly, 
and beat gently with the flat side of a meat chopper ; 
you may cook them plain or crumbed. 

The plain process consists in broiling them on 

the gridiron over or in front of a clear fire. The 

z^re should be a brisk one, and the cutlets should 

C le turned quickly and frequently while cooking. 

Chey should be thoroughly cooked, but not kept 

looking till hard and tough. 

Plain cutlets may also be fried in butter and 
lard. Crumbed cutlets require more trouble to 
prepare. The streak of meat with the fat and 
gristle which adheres to the bone need not be cut 
oif, but detatched from the bone, and turned up 
on the side of the " nut." Smear the cutlet thickly 
with well beaten egg, and dip several times in 
bread crumbs till thickly covered. Fry in butter 
and lard. 

Cutlets may be served in a plain, clear gravy, or 
with tomato or mushroom sauce. 

Mutton cutlets may also be stewed in a variety 
of ways, of which ,the following may be taken a.s 



9^ 



MEATS. 



the common form : Put some butter in a stewpan, 
and place your cutlets in this, turning them over 
and over until they are well saisies (seized) by the 
butter ; then add a small quantity of well-flavored 
stock or gravy, and let them simmer in this till 
done, when they are served with the gravy, which 
you thicken, if necessary, with a little flour, over 
them. Vegetables may be cooked with the cutlets, 
and served with them, or a garniture of vegetables, 
cooked separately, can be put round the dish. 

MuTTOX Cutlets a la Bexe. — Take six 
chops from the best end of a neck of mutton, and 
after sawing off the. ends, braise them until they 
are tender. Put them aside to cool. Make a 
thick, rich onion sauce, season it well, and run it 
through a sieve ; then take the braised chops, when 
they are perfectly cold, and cut them into cutlets, 
and trim them into a proper shape. Dip each 
cutlet into the onion sauce, then into bread crumbs, 
and afterwards into egg and bread crumbs. Fry 
them in boiling lard, a light brown color ; drain 
them well, and serve with or without tomato sauce. 

Shoulder of Mutton. — A shoulder of mutton 
weighing six pounds requires one hour and thirty 
minutes to roast; if stuffed, fifteen minutes longer. 
Before cooking, take out all the bone and fill the 
space with a dressing of bread crumbs, pepper, salt, 
parsley, sweet marjoram, one egg and a small p<3ce 
of butter, all well mixed.

MEATS. 'S^ 

MUTTOX PREPARED LIKE VeNISON. ChoOSe a 

large leg of mutton, and let it hang in a cool place 
ten days. Prepare a good forcemeat, and make a 
deep slit near the bone at the fillet end. Put in 
the forcemeat and sew over it a piece of linen to 
keep it in. Roast for two hours and thirty minutes. 
Make a gravy with the shank bone, one pound of 
soup beef, one onion, a few whole peppers, salt, and 
a pint and a half of water. Let this simmer for 
two hours. Add a dessertspoonful of flour to thicken 
it ; a little burnt sugar, if not dark enough in color, 
and more seasoning if necessary. When the meat is 
done, remove the linen cloth, strain part of the 
gravy over it, and serve. The remainder of the 
gravy should be served in a gravy-boat. Currant 
jelly should always be served with this dish. 

Saddle of Mutton, a la Portuguese. — To 
make this dish to look well, the saddle should be 
so carved as to have the sides left. When cold, 
the fillet, or undercut, and surplus meat is to be 
removed and cut small, and placed in a stewpan, 
with a little thickened gravy, mushroom catsup, 
pepper and salt. It should not be allowed to boil, 
but when hot should be placed on the saddle in the 
space from which the meat has been cut, and 
sjtrlnkled over with bread crumbs. It must be 
levelled to the sides, and placed in the oven. If 
the bread crumbs are not brown enough, a sala- 
mander must be made hot, and placed over it; 
it should be served very hot with currant jelly.

COLD ilUTTON. 

There are not many people who object to eating 
cold beef, but there seems to be a popular prejudice 
against cold mutton. As far as loolcs go, when two 
or three persons have dined off a leg of mutton the 
day before, no amount of parsley, be it ever so curly 
and fresh, can make it look nice ; but as a matter 
of taste cold meat, be it beef or mutton, is by no 
means devoid of merit at certain seasons, and witii 
a proper accompaniment of salads, pickles, and 
sauces. Only to be perfect a cold joint should not 
be touched until it is cold ; the joint of yesterday's 
dinner is quite a different affaii*. It is not every- 
body who can indulge, however, in such niceties of 
taste. Given a leg of mutton it must be used, and 
made to go as far as possible to furnish the second 
and even the third day's dinner. 

If you wish to be very economical with a leg of 
mutton you should carve it pretty much as you do 
a ham, then the next day put it for twenty minutes 
into a vessel containing boiling water, take it out and 
sprinkle some salt and a little flour over it, and })ut 
it to roast for twenty minutes before a good fire, 
basting frequently with some dripping, melted for 
the purpose. The result will be a very fair second 
edition of roast leg of mutton. Some, however, may 
object to carving mutton after the fashion of ham, 
and in that case a hash or a mince are the only 
ways of turning cold mutton to account; but there 



MEATS. 95 

are many ways of hashing mutton and other meats, 
and of mincing them, too. 

The great desideratum of a second-hand dish, so 
to speak, is that it should not taste as such. Noth- 
ing is more abominable than the bad taste which is 
so prominent in the attempts at warming up cold 
meat, which your plain cook is pleased to call 
minced veal, hashed mutton, etc. The only means 
to avoid that taste is to remove carefully from the 
cold meat you are going to use every part that has 
seen the fire, as well as gristle and fat. Let every 
slice be carefully trimmed, and let them all be as 
near as possible similar in size and shape ; then 
make your hash, and, even if you are not an expert 
at combining sauces and spices, at any rate it will 
not have a warmed-up taste. The following are 
various formulas for warming up mutton and other 
meats: 

Cut an onion in slices and fry it in butter till it 
assumes a deep brown color, then put in a table- 
spoonful of floor, and when it is well amalgamated 
with the butter add a little less than half a pint of 
stock broth, or even water previously warmed. Stir 
a few minutes on the fire, and then proceed to flavor 
your sauce with walnut or mushroom catsup, tomato 
sauce, spices, and pepper and salt, in such propor- 
tions as taste may suggest and practice will teach. 
A little burnt onioB browning may be put in if the 
sauce is not of a sufficiently deep color. When the 
flavoring is completed, strain the sauce through a 
7 



^6 MEATS. 

fine colander into a saucepan and place in it yont 
slices of meat. Keep the saucepan at a moderate 
beat till it is time to serve^ and send up your hash 
with a garland of bread sippets fried in butter round 
jt. The longer the meat lies in the sauce the better 
"will your dish be. 

Proceed as in the above receipt as far as the butter, 
flour, and onions are concerned ; then add to your 
sauce a moderate allowance of mustard ; then add 
the stock and a wineglassful of wliite or red wine. 
Season with catsup, spices, pepper, and salt. Strain 
and put in the meat, serving with pickles or not, 
according to taste. Beef and pork are best warmed 
up in this Avay. 

A homely mode of warming cold meat is in this 
wise : Fry some slices of onion in butter, and when 
they begin to take color put in your slices of meat, 
pepper, salt, and a sprinkling of flour. Keep on 
frying till the onions are thoroughly done and the 
meat warmed, then adtl a small quantity of stock, 
broth, or water, with a small quantity of vinegar, 
and serve. 

Minced parsley may be added to any of the above 
dishes with advantage. 

If the state of the joint you have to work upon 
will allow it, cut your slices the thickness of your 
finger, trim them all nicely, as near as possible the 
same shape, then dip them in egg, and cover them 
with a mixture of bread crumbs, powdered, sweet 
herbs, pepper, and salt in due proportion. Let them 



MEATS, 97 

rest a couple of hours, and egg and broad crumb 
them again; then fry them in plenty of lard till 
they are a nice color. Serve either alone with fried 
parsley as an ornament, or with any sauce, such as 
tomato, etc., which taste may suggest. Cold veal 
or pork treated in this way makes a very toothsome 
dish. 

Of course it is necessary to carry out these warm- 
ings-up, that the cold joint should not have been 
too heavily punished when it first appeared on the 
dinner table. When a joint has not enough left 
upon it to cut nice slices, then mincing is the best 
way to utilize it. 

Minced Mutton. — This is a very useful prepa- 
ration of " cold mutton," and will be found an ex- 
cellent mode. Cut slices ofif a cold roasted leg of 
mutton and mince it very fine; brown some flour 
in butter, and moisten it with some gravy ; add salt 
and pepper to taste, and let it simmer about ten or 
fifteen minntes to take off the raw taste of the flour; 
add another lot of butter and some parsley chopped 
fine, then add the minced meat, and let it simmer 
slowly, but not to boil, or the meat will be hard. 

Baked Minced Mutton. — The remains of any 
joint of cold roast mutton, one or two onions, one 
bunch of savory herbs, pepper and salt to taste, two 
blades of pounded mace or nutmeg, one teacupful 
of gravy, mashed potatoes. Mince an onion rather 
fine, and fry it a light-bro\vn color ; add the herba 
and mutton, both of which should be also finely 



98 MEATS. 

minced and well mixed ; season with pepper and 
salt, and a little pounded mace or nutmeg, and 
moisten M'ith the above proportion of gravy. Put 
a layer of mashed potatoes at the bottom of a dish, 
then the mutton, and then another layer of potatoes, 
and bake for about half an hour. If there should 
be a large quantity of meat, use two onions instead 
of one. 

Browned Minced INIutton. — Cut some lean 
meat from a roast leg of mutton, chop it fine, season 
it with pepper and salt, chopped parsley, and a little 
onion ; mix all together with a quarter of a pound of 
grated bread, moisten with a tablespoonful of vine- 
gar and a cup of good gravy; when put into the 
dish lay an ounce of butter in small bits on the top, 
grate bread over it, and add a little more butter; 
brown before the fire. 

HOW TO CX)OK LAMB. 

To Roast Lamb. — The hind quarter of lamb 
usually weighs from seven to ten pounds ; this size 
will take about two hours to roast it. Have a brisk 
fire. It must be very frequently basted while roast- 
ing, and sprinkled with a little salt, and dredged 
all over with flour, about half an hour before it is 
done. 

Fore Quarter op Lamb. — A fore quarter 
of a lamb is cooked the same way, but takes rather 
less time, if the same weight, than the hind quarter; 



MEATS. 99 

because it is a thinner joint ; one of nine pounds 
ouglit to be allowed two hours. 

Leg op Lamb. — A leg of lamb of four pounds' 
weight will take about an hour and a quarter ; if 
five pounds, nearly one hour and a half; a shoulder 
of four pounds will be roasted in an hour, or a very 
few minutes over. 

Ribs of Lamb. — Ribs of lamb are thin, and 
require great care to do gently at first, and brisker 
as it is finishing; sprinkle it with a little salt, and 
dredge it slightly with flour, about twenty minutes 
before it is done. It will take an hour or longer, 
according to thickness. 

Garnish and Vegetables for Roast Lamb. 
—All joints of roast lamb may be garnished with 
double parsley, and served up with either asparagus 
and new potatoes, spring spinach and new potatoes, 
green peas and new potatoes, or with cauliflowers or 
French beans and potatoes ; and never forget to 
send up mint sauce. The following will be found 
an excellent receipt for mint sauce : With three 
heaped tablespoonfuls of finely-chopped young mint, 
mix two of pounded and sifted sugar, and six of the 
best vinegar ; stir it until the sugar is dissolved. 

To Stew a Breast of Lamb. — Cut it into 
pieces, season them with pepper and salt, and stew 
them in weak gravy; when tender, thicken the 
sauce, and add a glass of white wine. Cucumbers, 
sliced and stewed in gravy, may be served with the 



100 MEATS. 

lamb, the same being poured over it. Or, tlie 
lamb may be served in a dish of stewed mushrooms. 

To Boil. A Neck or Breast of Lamb. — These 
are small, delicate joints, and therefore suited only 
for a very small family. The neck must be washed 
in warm water, and all the blood carefully cleaned 
away. Either of these joints should be put into 
cold water, well skimmed, and very gently boiled 
till done. Half an hour will be about sufficient' for 
either of them, reckoning from the time they come 
to a boil. 

Lamb Chops. — Take a loin of lamb, cut chops 
from it half an inch thick, retaining the kidney in 
its place ; dip them into egg and bread crumbs, fry 
and serve with fried parsley. When chops are 
made from a breast of lamb, the red bone at the 
edo-e of the breast should be cut off, and the breast 
parboiled in water or broth, with a sliced carrot 
and two or three onions, before it is divided into 
cutlets, which is done by cutting between every 
second or third bone, and preparing them, in every 
respect, as the last. If house-Iamb steaks are to be 
done white — stew them in milk and water till very 
tender, with a bit of lemon-peel, a little salt, some 
pepper and mace. Have ready some veal gravy, 
and put the steaks into it ; mix some mushroom- 
powder, a cup of cream, and the least bit of flour; 
shake the steaks in this liquor, stir it, and let it get 



MEATS, 101 

quite hot, but not boil. Just before you take it up, 
j)ut in a few white mushrooms. 

Lamb Cutlets and Spinach. — Eigftt cutlets, 
egg and bread crumbs, salt and pepper to taste, a 
little clarified butter. Take the cutlets from a neck 
of lamb, and shape them by cutting off the thick 
part of the chine-bone. Trim off most of the fit 
-and all the skin, and scrape the top part of the 
bgnes quite clean. Brush the cutlets ov^er with egg, 
sprinkle them with bread crumbs, and season with 
j)epper and salt. Now dip them into clarified but- 
ter, sprinkle over a few more bread crumbs, and 
fry them over a sliarp fire, turning them when re- 
quired. Lay them before tlie fire to drain, and 
arrange them oa a dish with spinach in the centre, 
which should be prev:iously v/ell boiled, drained, 
chopped, and seasoned. Peas, asparagus, or beans 
may be substituted for the spinach. 

Loin, Neck, and Breast op Lamb. — A loin 
of lamb will be roasted in about an hour and a 
quarter; a neck in an hour; and a breast in three- 
quarters of an hour. Do not forget to salt and 
flour these joints about twenty minutes before they 
are done. 

Broiled Lamb Steak. — Broil slowly until 
quite done, then make a gravy with fresh butter 
meked by the steak, add a dust of pepper, and a 
little salt dissolved in a tablespoonful of water; 
serve with peas, ^)otatoea, luid salads. 



102 MEATS. 

Leg op Lamb to Boil. — It must be put into 
boiling water, then the saucepan (or deep fish-kettle 
with a di'ainer is best) drawn back, and the water 
allowed to simmer gently, reckoning eighteen 
minutes to each pound ; if it boils fast, the meat 
will be hard and the skin broken. It should be 
lifted out of the water with the drainer, and no fork 
be stuck into it ; if the scum has settled upon it, 
wash it oiY with some of the liquor before sending 
to table. Pai-sley and butter are served with this, 
or delicate caper sauce and young carrots. 

Leg of Lamb to Eoast. — All lamb should be 
very well cooked, and not put too near the fire at 
first ; from eighteen to twenty minutes to the pound 
before a clear but not fierce heat. It may be served 
with spinach, peas, or asparagus. 

Boxed Quarter of Lamb. — Bone a quarter of 
lamb, taking care not to injure the skin. Make a 
seasoning in the following manner : Cut three 
onions and fry them in lard ; when these are nearly 
done, add some parsley, chopped very fine, spice, 
two spoonfuls of cream, and four eggs. Simmer 
this mixture over the fire until quite thick, then 
stuff it into the meat in the spaces left by the bones, 
roll the meat up and roast it, basting with bread 
crumbs and butter. Serv^e with a rich sauce. 

Fricassee of Lamb. — Cut the best part of a 
breast of lamb into square pieces of two inches 
each ; wash, dry, and flour them. Boil together 



MEATS, 103 

four ounces of butter, one of fat bacon, some pars- 
ley or sweet marjoram for ten minutes, and tlien 
add the meat; squeeze in the juice of half a lemon; 
chop an onion with pepper and salt and throw in. 
Simmer all for two hours ; add the yelks of two 
eggs well beaten, shake over the fire two minutes, 
and serve. 

Savory Lamb Pie. — Cut the meat into pieces, 
and season it with finely-beaten pepper, salt, mace, 
cloves, and nutmeg. Make a good puff-paste, and 
put the meat into it, adding some lambs' sweet- 
breads, seasoned in the same manner. Put in some 
oysters and forcemeat balls, some yelk of egg, and 
tops of asparagus, boiled green. Put butter all 
over the pie, and put on the covering paste, and let 
it bake for an hour and a half in a quick oven. 
Mix a pint of gravy, the oyster liquor, a gill of 
wine, and a little nutmeg, with the yelks of two or 
three eggs well beaten, and stir it in the same direc- 
tion all the time. When it boils, take the cover off 
the pie, pour the mixture into it. Cover again and 
serve. 

Stewed Breast of Lamb, with Peas or Cu- 
cumbers. — First roast the lamb to a nice brown 
color. Mix a tablespoonful of flour smoothly in 
cold water, burn a teaspoonful of sugar in an iron 
spoon, pour boiling Avater over it into the flour, 
mix all smoothly ; strain it ; add as much boiling 
water as will barely cover the meat, putting it into 



104 . MEATS. 

a stewpaii wltli tlie bones upwards, add a blade of 
mace, and a little salt; let it stew for two hours, 
till the meat is very tender and the bones will slip; 
M'hile the meat is cooking boil some peas, or, in 
their place, peel some small cucumbers, put them into 
boiling water, with a little salt and a small piece of 
butter, and boil for twenty minutes; drain them. 
When the meat is ready, thicken the gravy if neces- 
sary; add a little butter and a tablespoonful of 
catsup, place the meat on a dish, bones downward, 
strain the gravy over it. Drain the i)eas, or cut 
the cucumbers across in three pieces and place 
round the meat. 

Stewed Leg of Lamb. — Dredge the joint with 
flour, and put it in a stewpan with half a pound of 
butter, some paisley, pepper, and salt. Stew gently 
for half an hour. Choose some small, sound heads 
of lettuce and cut in small pieces ; put them in a 
stewpan with a little sorrel, and stew with the mut- 
ton for ano'.her hour. Dish the joint, and add to 
the liquor in the stewpan half a })int of water. 
Boil up, pour over the meat, and serve. 

LA:\rB SwEET-RREADS. — Blanch them, and put 
them into cold water. Soak five minutes; put them 
into a stewpan with a ladleful of broth, some pej)- 
per and salt, a small bunch of button onions, and 
a blade of mace; stir in a piece of butter braided 
in flour, and stew for half an hour. Have ready 
the yelks of three eggs well beaten in cream, with 



MEATS. 105 

a little minced parsley and grated nutmeg. Add 
some boiled asparagus tops. After the cream is in, 
simmer, but do not boil, as it would curdle. 
French beans or peas, if very tender, are an im- 
provement. 

IjArded Lamb. — Lard the upper side of a fore 
quarter of lamb with lean bacon, and cover the 
lower side thickly with grated bread. Cover the 
whole with paper to prevent burning, and roast it. 
Take it from the fire when nearly done, and cover 
the lower side once more with gi'ated bread ; season 
it with salt, pepper, and finely-chopped parsley ; 
put it before a brisk, clear fire to brown. Pour 
over all a little cider vinegar, and serve. 

Chops, with Cucumbers. — Fry the chops of a 
light brown, and stew them for half an hour in 
good gravy ; thicken and flavor the gravy, and add 
to it some cucumbers, thickly sliced and previously 
stewed. Boil them up together, and put the cucum- 
bers on the dish, and the chops on them. 

To Dress Kidneys. — Cut them through the 
centre; take out the core; pull the kernels apart ; 
put them into the-saucepan without any water, and 
set them on the fire where they may get hot, not 
boil ; in half an hour put the kidneys into cold 
water, Avash them clean, and put them back into 
the saucepan, with just enough water to cover them ; 
boil them one hour, then take them up ; clean off 
the fat and skin ; put into the frying-pan some 



106 MEATS. 

butter, pepper and salt; dredge in a little flour, 
half a pint of hot water, and the kidneys ; let them 
simmer twenty minutes; stir them often; do not 
let them fry, because it liardeus them. This is a 
very nice dish for breakfast. 

Fried Sheep Kidneys. — Cut the kidneys open 
without quite dividing them, remove the skin, and 
put a small piece of butter in the frying-pan. 
When the butter is melted, lay in the kidneys the 
flat side downwards, and fry them for seven or 
eight minutes, turning them when they are half 
done. Serve on a piece of dry toast, season with 
pepper and salt, and put a small piece of butter in 
each kidney ; pour the gravy from the pan over 
them, and serve very hot. 

Mutton Kidneys Broiled. — Skin and split 
without parting asunder ; skewer them through the 
outer edge and keep them flat ; lay the opened sidea 
first to the fire, which should be clear and brisk ; 
in ten minutes turn them ; sprinkle with salt and 
Cayenne, and when done, which will be in three 
minutes afterAvards, take them from the fire, put a 
piece of butter inside them, squeeze some lemon- 
juice over them, and serve as hot as possible. 

Kidney OxMELETTE. — Remove all the fat and 
skin from six kidneys. Cut into very fine pieces, 
season with salt and pepper, and fry quickly iu 
butter. Beat together two dozen eggs with a wine- 
glass of wine. Heat quarter of a pound of butter 



MEATS. 107 

in a frying-pan, pour in the eggs, and just before 
they are set, put the kidneys in the middle. Turn 
over the ends of the omelette, and brown on top, 
before a clear fire, and serve, with thin slices of 
lemon on the edge of the dish. 

Kidneys a la Brochette. — Remove the thin 
skin from the outside of the kidneys. Split in two, 
without entirely separating the halves. Lay flat 
with a little skewer passed through each to keep 
the halves apart. Powder with salt and pepper, 
put them on a gridiron, with the inner side of the 
kidneys next the fire. When one side is brown, 
turn them, and when the outside is done, the edges 
will turn up to form a cup ; fill this with a little 
cold butter beaten with minced herbs; squeeze in a 
little lemon-juice, and serve. 

Roast Veal. — Season a breast of veal with 
pepper and salt ; skewer the sweet-bread firmly in 
its place, flour the meat and roast it slowly before a 
moderate fire for about four hours — it should be of 
a fine brown, but not dry ; baste it with butter. 
When done, put the gravy in a stewpan, add a 
piece of butter rolled in browned flour, and if there 
should not be quite enough gravy, add a little more 
M'ater, with pepper and salt to taste. The gravy 
should be brown. 

Spiced Veal. — Cut the thick portion of a loin 
of veal into small pieces, and cover it with hot 
spiced vinegar. To every half pint of vinegar put 



108 MEATS. 

a teaspoonful of allspice, a little mai^e, salt and 
Cayenne pepper to taste. Stew till tiie meat is 
tender, adding more vinegar if it dries too fast. 

Curry of Veal. — Cut part of a breast of veal 
in moderate sized pieces ; put it in a stewpan with 
an onion and a shalot sliced fine, a slice of lemon, 
one ounce of butter, a little parsley and thyme, and 
a tablespoonful of curry-powder mixed with the 
same quantity of flour ; let the whole sweat together 
until the meat is slightly brown ; add sufficient 
broth or water for the sauce ; let it boil gently till 
the veal is done ; strain the sauce through a sieve, 
pour it over the veal quite hot, and serve with rice 
in a separate dish. 

Fricassee of Veal. — Cut in bits lean veal, 
and parboil in salted water. Drain oif the water, 
dust the veal with flour, and brown in butter ; add 
sufficient of the broth for the gravy to the browned 
butter, and thicken very little with flour. Toast 
bread, lay the slices on the platter, lay on each slice 
a part of the veal, and pour the gravy over the whole. 
Serve with mashed potatoes. 

Veal Cutlets with Sweet Herbs. — Chop all 
sorts of sweet herbs, mushrooms, onions, pepper and 
salt, with a spoonful of butter ; dip the cutlets in 
this, and reduce the sauce to make it stick; do them 
over with egg and bread crumbs, and set them in 
the oven to bake ; then add a glass of white wine to 
the sauce, skim it well, and when the cutlets are 



MEATS'. 109 

done lay them on a dish, and send them- to table 
with the sauce poured over. 

Calf's Head. — Split the head in two parts, and 
remove the brains, wash the brains in three waters, 
and lay them for an hour in cold salted water. 
AVash the head clean, and soak it in tepid water, 
until the blood is well drawn out. Put it in cold 
water ; when it boils remove the scum, and simmer 
gently, until a straw can be run through it. A 
head with the skin will take three hours, if large, 
and without the skin two. Scald the brains, by 
pouring over them boiling water, take them out and 
remove the skin or film, put them in plenty of cold 
water, and simmer gently fifteen minutes. Chop 
them slightly, stew them in sweet butter ; add a 
teaspoon half full of lemon-juice, or not, as desired, 
and a little salt ; when done, skin the tongue, lay it 
in the centre of the dish, and the brains round it. 
Send the head to the table very hot, with drawn 
butter poured over it, and more in the tureen. 

Veal Chops, Breaded. — Take six or seven 
handsomely cut chops, season them with salt and 
pepper, and put them into melted butter. When 
sufficiently soaked put them into beaten eggs, take 
them out, and roll each separately in bread crumbs; 
make the chops as round as you can with your 
hand, and lay them in a dish. When all are 
breaded, broil them slowly over a moderate fire, that 
the bread may not be too highly colored. Serve 
with clear gravy. 



110 MEATS. 

Veal Cutlets, with Ragout.— Cut some large 
cutlets from the fillet, beat them flat, and lard them ; 
strew over them pepper, salt, bread crumbs, and 
shred parsley ; then make a ragout of veal sweet- 
breads and mushrooms; fry the cutlets of a nice 
brown in melted butter ; lay them in a dish, and 
serse the ragout very hot over them. 

Fillet of Veal, Boiled. — Choose a small, 
delicate fillet for this purpose ; prepare as for roasting, 
or stuff with an oyster forcemeat; bind round with 
a tape ; cover it with milk and water in equal 
quantities, and let it boil very gently for four hours, 
keeping it carefully skimmed. Send it to the table 
with a rich white sauce, or, if stuffed with oyster 
forcemeat, with oyster sauce; garnish with stewed 
celery, and slices of bacon. 

Breast of Veal, with Oyster Sauce. — Rub 
the veal all over with salt and pepper. Cover it with 
buttered paper and then with coarse paste, baste 
frequently, to prevent the paper and paste from 
burning ; half an hour before serving, remove the 
paste and paper. Beat the white of an egg, add a 
very little loaf sugar, and wet the veal with the 
egg and sugar, without leaving any lumps of the 
glazing, and brown it nicely. Prepare drawn 
butter with oysters, and serve the sauce in a tureen. 
This sauce can be used with roast or boiled veal, to 
good advantage, if oysters are plenty. Serve with 
mashed potatoes and celery. 



MEATS. Ill 

Shoulder of Veal. — Cut the veal into small, 
square pieces, and parboil them. Put the bones 
and trimmings into another pot, with a very little 
water, and stew them slowly, to make the gravy. 
Put the meat into a pie-dish, (deep) and season it 
with salt, Cayenne, tiie yellow rind of a large 
lemon grated, and some j>owdered mace or nutmeg. 
Add pieces of butter rolled in flour, or cold dripping 
of roast veah Strain the gravy over the meat. 
Set in a hot oven, and bake brown. When nearly 
done, throw in a glass of wine, and serve hot. 

Hashed Calf's Head. — Calf's head, one egg, 
a teaspoouful of flour, a grating of nutmeg, three 
tablespoonfuls of milk, some slices of bacon, a dozen 
forcemeat balls, pepper, salt, mace, an onion, bunch 
of herbs, one wineglassful of port wine, eight mush- 
rooms, pint of gravy, lard. Carefully cleanse the 
head of a freshly killed calf, boil it three-<(uarters 
of an hour, let it stand till cold, then slice it up into 
uice looking pieces. Peel the tongue and cut it into 
thin slices; boil the brain in a cloth, chop it fine, 
and beat it up with the egg, flour, milk, and nut- 
meg- Have ready a frying-pan of boiling lard, and 
fry the mixture in fritters the size of a crown piece. 
Flavor the gravy with the whole pepper, mace, 
cloves, herbs, onion, aad Cayenne pepper. Let it 
simmer ten minutes, strain, and add the wine and 
mushrooms. Place the sliced head in this, and let 
it heat gently for ten minutes. Serve in the centre

of tlie dish with the brain fritters, bacon, forcemeat 
balls, round. Strew little egg- balls over the whole. 

CoLLAEKD Calf's Head. — Boil half a calf's 
head in just enough water to cover ft. Let it boil 
for two hours. Remove it from the broth and cut 
all the meat from the bones. Return the bt)nes 
again to the broth and let them continue to stew. 
Put into the broth some sage leaves ; take out the 
brains and put the meat into a jar with some slices 
of ham, pepper, and salt, and the t&ngue. Set the 
jar in a good oven for two horn's ; let it be closely 
covered. Beat up the bi*ains with two eggs and 
pour them in. Remove the whole to a mould, and 
fill it with strained broth. Dish when Cfuite cold. 

Tea Pie of Veal. — ^The scrag, breast, or neck 
of veal will be suitable for this disl:^. Cut the meat 
into slices about an inch thick, fry some slices of 
salt pork in an iron pot, flour the slie-es of vetil, put 
them in the hot fat, and brown them ; cover them 
with water, and simmer half an hour. Season with 
salt and |>epper, and di^etlge with ifonr. Make a 
common paste, roll half an inch thick, and cover the 
meat. Cover t?)e pot with a hot Iran cover; ceok 
gently for an hour.

flour, and as much water as will cover all. Cover 
with a sheet of paste, cutting a hole in the centre, 
put the lid on the pot, and cook slowly for two 
hours. Place the soft crust on a dish, put the meat 
on that, and on the top lay the hard crust with the 
brown side up. Serve the gravy separately. To 
have the crust of a pot-pie brown, set the pot for a 
few moments over a clear fire, after the meat is out. 

Veal Minced. — Mince the veal as finely as pos- 
sible, separating the skin, gristle, and bones, with 
which a gravy should be made. Put a small quantity 
of the gravy into a stewpan, with a little lemon-peel 
grated, and a spoonful of milk or cream. Thicken 
it with a little butter and flour, mixed gradually 
with the gravy ; season it with salt and a little lemon- 
juice and Cayenne pepper. Put in the minced veal 
and let it simmer a few minutes. Serve it up with 
sippets of bread, and garnish with sliced lemon. 

Minced Yeal, with Poached Eggs, — Mince 
part of a fillet of veal extremely fine, put it into a 
stewpan, and pour over it a sufficient quantity of 
good hot sauce to make it of a tolerable thickness ; 
then have a stewpanful of water, with a little vine- 
gar in it, and as soon as it boils break in two eggs, 
and keep boiling quickly, but not so as to boil over. 
AVhen they are done take them out with a cullender 
spoon, put them into another stewpan with clear 
warm water, and so on till six are done. When 
you want to serve, squeeze a little lemon-juice in the 



114 MEATS. 

mince, pour it on a hot dish, taKe the eggs out of 
the water, neatly trim them, lay them on some veal, 
and serve. 

Minced Veal. — Take three or four pounds of the 
lean only of a fillet or loin of veal, and mince it very 
finely, adding a slice or two of cold ham, minced 
also ; add three or four small young onions, chopped 
small, a teaspoonful of sweet marjoram leaves, rubbed 
from the stalks, the yellow rind of a small lemon, 
grated, and a teaspoonful of mixed mace and nut- 
meg, powdered ; mix all well together, and dredge 
it with a little flour. Put it into a stewpan, with 
sufficient gravy of cold roast veal to moisten it, and 
a large tablespoonful or more of fresh butter. Stir 
it well, and let it stew till thoroughly done. If the 
veal has been previously cooked a quarter of an 
hour will be sufficient. It will be much improved 
by adding a pint or more of small button mush- 
rooms, cut from the stems, and then put in whole ; 
also, by stirring in two tablespoonfuls of cream about 
five minutes before it is taken from the fire. 

Fried Patties. — Mince a little cold veal and 
ham, allowing one-third ham and two-thirds veal. 
Add an egg, boiled hard and chopped, and a season- 
ing of pounded mace, salt, pepper, and lemon-peel ; 
moisten with a little gravy and cream. Make a 
good puff-paste, roll rather thin, and cut it into round 
or square pieces; put the mince between two of 
them, pinch the edges to keep in the gravy, and fry 
a light brown. They may also be baked in patty- 



MEATS. 115 

pans. In that case they should be brushed ovei 
with the yelk of an egg before they are put in the 
oven. To make a variety, oysters may be substituted 
for the ham. Fry the patties about fifteen minutes. 

Veal Forcemeat. — Free a piece of lean veal 
from skin and sinews. To one pound of meat put 
one pound of suet, chopped very fine, and one pound 
of grated bread crumbs, two drachms of chopped 
parsley, one drachm each of lemon-peel, sweet herbs, 
and onions, half a drachm of powdered allspice. 
Pound all in a mortar, adding a well-beaten egg or 
two if too dry. Rub all well together and season 
with pepper and salt. 

Veal Croquettes. — Half a pound of veal, 
minced fine, quarter of a pound of stale bread crumbs. 
Put on in a saucepan and moisten with the liquor 
the veal was boiled in, and the raw yelk of two eggs 
mixed in with the bread crumbs; cook it until it 
begins to leave the sides of the pan. Two teaspoon- 
fuls of chopped pai'sley, one of thyme, one of chopped 
onions, half a nutmeg, quarter of a teaspoonful of 
Cayenne pepper, quarter of mace, a saltspoonful of 
salt, two ounces of butter; mix the above into the 
bread crumbs, then add the veal after well mixing. 
Roll out each croquette into the shape of a pear, 
then dip them into the whiteof anegg, and sprinkle 
with bread crumbs, and fry in hot lard. Sauce 
served with them should be brown sauce with spices 
and wine in it. 



116 MEATS. 

Veal Sausages. — Chop equal.quantities of lean 
veal and fat bacon, a handful of sage, a little salt, 
pepper, and a few anchovies. Beat all in a mortar, 
and, when used, roll and fry it, and serve with fried 
sippets or on stewed vegetables. 

Veal Rolls. — Cut thin slices, and spread on 
them a fine seasoning of a very few crumbs, a little 
chopped bacon or scraped ham, and a little suet and 
parsley, pepper, salt, and a small piece of pounded 
mace. This stuffing may either fill up the roll like a 
sausage, or rolled with the meat. In either case tie it 
up very tight and stew it very slowly in gravy. 
Serve it when tender, after skimming it nicely. 

Superior Veal Rolls. — Cut a few slices from 
a cold fillet of veal half an inch thick ; rub them 
over with egg ; lay a thin slice of fat bacon over 
each piece of veal ; brush these with the egg, and 
over this spread forcemeat thinly; roll up each 
piece tightly, egg and bread crumb them, and fry 
them a rich brown. Serve with mushroom sauce 
or brown gravy. Fry the roll from ten to fifteen 
minutes. 

Veal Sweet-bread. — ^Trlra a fine sweet- bread ; 
parboil it for five minutes, and throw it into a basin 
of cold water. Roast it plain, or beat up the yelk 
of an egg, and prepare some fine bread crumbs. 
A¥hen the sweet-bread is cold, dry it thoroughly in 
a cloth ; run a skewer through it ; egg it with a 
paste-brush, powder it well with bread crumbs, and 



MEATS. -.. 117 

roast it. For sauce, fried bread crumbs round it, 
and melted butter, with a little mushroom catsup 
and lemon-juice, or serve them on buttered toast, 
garnished with egg sauce or with gravy. 

Sweet-breads. — Scald them in salt and water, 
and take out the stringy parts. Then put them in 
cold water for a few moments. Dry them in a 
towel, dip in egg and crumbs, and fry brown in but- 
ter. When they are done, take them on a dish, 
pour into the frying-pan a large cup of sweet cream, 
a little pepper and salt, and a little green parsley, 
chopped fine. Dust in a very little flour, and when 
it boils up pour it over the breads, and send to the 
table hot. 

Fried Sweet-bread. — Sweet-breads should al- 
ways soak half an hour in tepid water with a pinch 
of salt in it, to make them white. Put them after- 
wards in cold water, and pljjce over the fire to boil ; 
boil ten minutes. Cut them into slices, brush them 
with beaten egg, and cover with grated bread 
crumbs. Fry each slice till brown, in butter. Serve 
with rich gravy. 

Veal Olfves. — Cut two thin steaks from a fil- 
let of veal ; beat them, and rub them over with the 
yelk of an egg ; cut them in strips four inches long. 
Over every strip lay a very thin piece of fat bacon, 
and strew each witii grated bread crumbs, a little 
lemon-peel, and chopped parsley, and season with 
salt and Cayenne. Roll each strip up and fasten 



118 ^ MEATS. 

With a little wooden skewer. Dip each roll into 
egg, grated bread, and chopped parsley. Put some 
clarified beef dripping into a frying-pan, let it boil; 
then throw in tlie rolls, and fry light brown. To 
a pint of good gravy add a dessertspoonful of lemon 
pickle, a dessertspoonful of walnut catsup, and a tea- 
spoonful of browning, Cayenne pepper and salt to 
taste, and thicken with butter rolled in flour. Place 
the fried olives on a dish, strain the gravy over 
them hot; garnish with lemon pickle and forced 
meat balls, and strew over all pickled mushrooms 
to flavor. 

Roast Leg of Pork. — Cut a slit n,ear the 
knuckle, and fill the space with sage and onion, 
chopped fine, and seasoned with pepper and salt, 
with or without bread crumbs. Rub sweet oil on 
the skin, to prevent it blistering and make the 
crackling crisp ; and the outer rind may be scored 
with lines, about half an inch apart. If the leg 
weigh seven or eight pounds, it will require from 
two and a half to three hours' roasting before a 
strong fire. Serve with apple sauce and potatoes ; 
which are like\vise eaten with all joints of roasted 
pork. 

If the stuffing be liked mild, scald the onions 
before chopping them. If pork is not stuffed, you 
may serve it up with sage and onion sauce, as well 
as apple sauce, which should always accompany 
roast pork, whether it is stuffed or not ; and also 



MEATS. 119 

with mustard. Roast leg of pork must always be 
served up with plenty of nicely boiled potatoes. 

Fresh Pork Pot-Pie.^ — Boil a epare-rib, after 
removing all the fat, and cracking the bones, until 
tehJer; remove the scum as it rises, and when ten- 
der, season with salt and pepper ; half an hour be- 
fore time for serving the dinner, thicken the gravy 
with a little flour, have ready another kettle into 
which remove all the bones and most of the gravy, 
leaving only sufficient to cover the jjot half an inch 
above the rim that rests on the stove ; put in the 
crust ; cover tight, and boil steadily twenty-five 
minutes. To prepare the crust, work into light 
dough a small bit of butter, roll it out thin, cut it 
in small square cakes, and lay them on the mould- 
ing-board until very light ; if made with brewers' 
yeast, the butter should be melted in the wetting of 
the crust, and rolled out before rising, as the first 
effervescence of brewers' yeast is the strongest; 
work the dough well before making up the cakes. 

Pork Chops. — Cut the chops about half an inch 
thick ; trim them neatly, (few cooks have any idea 
how much credit they get by this;) put a frying-pan 
on the fire, with a bit of butter ; as soon as it is 
hot, put in your chops, turning them often till 
brown all over; they will be done enough in about 
fifteen minutes; take one upon a plate and try it; 
if done, season it with a little finely-minced onion, 
powdered sage, and pepper and salt. A little pow- 



120 MEATS. 

dered sage, etc., strewed over them, will give them 
a nice relish. 

PojRK Steak, Broiled. — The tenderloin is the 
best for steak, but any lean white meat is good. 
Broil slowly, after splitting it so as to allow it to 
cook through without drying or burning. When 
ready to turn over, dip the cooked side in a nice 
gravy of butter, pepper, and salt, which should be 
prepared on a plate, and kept hot without boiling. 
It must be. well done. It requires slow broiling. 
It Avill take at least twenty minutes to broil a pork 
steak. 

Pork Cutlets. — Cut slices an inch thick from 
a delicate loin of pork, trim them neatly ; take ofi* 
a part of the fat, or if the fat is not liked, remove 
the whole of it. Dredge a little pepper and salt on 
the cutlets, and broil them over a clear fire about 
twenty minutes. They may be dipped in beaten 
egg and afterwards in grated bread crumbs flavored 
with minced sage, and then broil. If fried, they 
should be well seasoned with pepper and salt, and 
dredged with flour before being put in the fat. The 
best fat is fried from bacon or salt pork. 

Pork and Apple Fritters. — Prepare a light 
batter, freshen or use cold boiled or baked pork ; 
cut it fine enough for hash, and fry it a little to 
extract some of the fat for frying the fritters. Peel 
sour apples, and cut or chop them not quite as fine 
as the pork ; mix first the pork and then the apples 



MEATS. 121 

in the batter, and fry them brown. Potatoes, 
parsnips, salsify, or any vegetable desired, can be 
used in the same manner. 

English Eaised Poek Pie. — Put into a stew- 
pan six ounces of lard, with a teacupful of cold 
water ; let it stand by the fire till boiling, then put 
to it one pound of flour. Mix it well with a spoon 
till cool enough to raise. When you have raised 
your pies, let them stand for half an hour before 
}'0u put in your meat; put on your cover and orna- 
ment to your fancy. To prepare the meat,, cut up 
the pork to about the size of dice, add pepper and 
salt to your taste (but take care that the pepper be 
equally distributed), add one tablespoonful of water 
to each pound of meat. One pound of flour will 
bake three good-sized pies. They require three 
hours' baking in a very moderate oven. 

Fresh Pork Pie. — Boil lean, fresh pork, and 
make the paste as for beefsteak pie ; add to the pie, 
after putting in the meat, two potatoes cut fine, 
which have been before boiled ; season with pepper, 
salt, and a dust of summer savory. If there is not 
fat enough in the pork, add butter; thicken the 
gravy with a little flour. The pie should contain 
as much gravy as possible. It is good cold or hot. 

Scrambled Pork. — Freshen nice salt pork, cut 
it in mouthfuls, and partly fry it. Just before it is 
done break into the pan with the pork from six to 
twelve eggs, break and mix the yelks with the 



122 MEATS. 

whites, and stir them quickly with the pork. If 
the pork is fried brown before the egg is added, 
there may be too much fat for the egg ; if so, put 
it in a gravy-boat if needed for the table, or sav^e it 
for shortening. Baked potatoes are excellent with 
salt meats that have a gravy of their own. 

To Cure Hams. — To each green ham of 
eighteen pounds, one dessertspoonful of saltpetre; 
quarter of a pound of brown sugar rubbed on tho 
fleshy side of the ham, and round the hock. Cover 
the fleshy part with fine salt half an inch thick, and 
pack away in tubs ; let them remain from three to 
six weeks, according to size. Before smoking, rub 
off any salt that may remain on the ham, and cover 
well with ground black pepper, especially on the 
bone and hock. Hang up to drain for two days ; 
smoke with green wood for eight days, or until the 
rind is a light chestnut color. The pepper is a 
certain preventive of the fly. 

Baked Ham. — Soak for an hour in water, and 
wipe very dry ; cover with a thin batter, and put it 
in a deep dish, with a grate under it, to keep it up 
■from the gravy. When fully done, take off the 
skin and batter. Cool and garnish as boiled ham ; 
serve with wine sauce. 

Ham Pie. — Make a crust the same as for soda 
biscuit; line your dish; then put in a layer of 
potatoes sliced thin, pepper, salt, and a little butter; 



MEATS. 123 

then a layer of lean liara; add considerable water, 
and you will have an excellent pie. 

Ham Omelette. — Two eggs, four ounces of 
butter, half a sultspoonful of pepper, two tablespoon- 
fuls of minced ham. Mince the ham very finely, 
without any fat, and fry it for two minutes in a little 
butter; then make the batter for the omelette, stir 
in the ham, and proceed as in tlie case of a plain 
omelette. Do not add any salt to the batter, as the 
ham is usually sufficiently salt to impart a flavor to 
the omelette. Good lean bacon, or tongue, answers 
equally well for this dish ; but they must also be 
slightly cooked previously to mixing them with the 
batter. Serve very hot and quickly, without gravy. 

Ham Toast. — Grate a sufficiency of the lean of 
cold ham. Mix some beaten yelk of egg with a 
little cream, and thicken it with the grated ham. 
Then put the mixture into a saucepan over the fire, 
and let it simmer awhile. Have ready some slices 
of bread nicely toasted (all the crust being pared 
off) and well buttered. Spread it over thickly with 
the ham mixture, and send it to table warm. 

Omelette of Ham, Tongue, or Sausage. — 
There are three methods of making a ham or 
tongue omelette : first, by simply cutting the meat 
into small dice, tossing it in butter, and pouring the 
well beaten and seasoned eggs upon it in the pan, 
and letting them remain until set, when serve ; or 
pound the meat to a paste in a mortar, and beat it 



124 MEATS. 

up with the eggs, and fry in the usual manner 
The third method is to beat the eggs and fry them, 
then lay upon them the meat (which has been pre- 
viously tossed in butter), fold in the ends of the 
omelette, and serve as hot as possible. 

Sausages, No. 1. — The proper seasoning is salt, 
pepper, sage, summer-savory, or thyme ; they should 
be one-third fat, the remainder lean, finely chopped, 
and the seasonings well mixed, and proportioned 
so that one herb may not predominate over the 
others. If skins are used, they cannot be prepared 
with too much care; but they are about as well 
made into cakes ; spread the cakes on a clean white- 
wood board, and keep them in a dry cool place ; 
fry them long and gently. 

Sausages No. 2 are best when quite fresh made, 
Put a bit of butter or dripping into a clean frying- 
pan ; as soon as it is melted (before it gets hot) put 
in the sausages, and shake the pan for a minute, 
and keep turning them (be careful not to break or 
prick them in so doing) ; fry them over a very slow 
fire till they are nicely browned on all sides ; when 
they are done, lay them on a hair sieve, placed be- 
fore the fire for a couple of minutes to drain the fat 
from them. The secret of frying sausages is, to let 
them get hot very gradually ; they then will not 
burst, if they are not stale. The common practice 
to prevent their bursting is to prick them with a 
fork ; but this lets the gravy out. 



MEATS. 125 

Sausage Dumplings. — Make one pound of 
flour and two ounces of dripping, or chopped suet, 
into a firm paste, by adding just enough water to 
enable you to knead the whole together. Divide 
this paste into twelve equal parts, roll each of these 
out sufficiently large to be able to fold up one of 
the beef sausages in it, wet the edge of the paste to 
fasten the sausage securely in it, and, as you finish 
off each sausage dumpling, drop it gently into a 
large enough saucepan, containing plenty of boiling 
water, and when the whole are finished, allow them 
to boil gently by the side of the fire for one hour, 
and then take up the dumplings with a spoon free 
from water, on to a dish, and eat them while they 
are hot. 

Sausage Cakes. — Chop a pound of good pork 
fine ; add half a teaspoonful of pepper, half a spoon- 
ful of cloves, half a spoonful of coriander seed, and 
four tablespoonfuls of cold water. Mix all well 
together, form them into small cakes, and fry in a 
hot pan. 

Scrapple. — Take eight pounds of scrap pork, 
that will not do for sausage, boil it in four gallons 
of water; wlien tender, chop it fine, strain the 
liquor and pour it back into the pot ; put in the 
meat, season it with sage, summer savory, salt and 
pepper to taste, stir in a quart of corn meal ; after 
simmering a few minutes, thicken it with buckwheat

flour very thick; it requires very little cooking 
after it is thickened, but must be stirred constantly. 
To Prepare Fowls for Cooking. — Professor 
Blot, in his lectures on cooking, gives the following 
directions for preparing fowls : Never wash meat 
or fowls. Wipe them dry if you choose, and if 
there is anything unacceptable it can be sliced ofif 
thinly. In cooking a chicken whole, no Avashing 
is to be done, except the gall-bladder be broken, 
when it is best to cut the chicken up and wash it 
thoroughly. Again, in cleansing chickens, never 
cut the breast ; make a slit down the back of the 
neck, and take out the crop that way. Then cut 
the neck-bone close, and after the bird is stuffed 
the skin of the neck can be turned up over the 
back, sewed down, and the crop will look full and 
round. Further, the breast-bone should be struck 
smartly with the back of a heavy knife, or with a 
rolling-pin, to break it. This will make the chicken 
lie rounder and fuller after it is stuffed. The legs 
and wings should also be fastened with thread close 
to the side, running a long needle through the body 
for that purpose. A good stuffing for baked or 
roast chicken may be made by chopping an onion 
fine, and stirring it Avith two ounces of butter in a 
saucepan on the fire. It is taken off a moment, 
and bread, which has been soaked in water and the 
water squeezed out, is added, with salt, pepper, a 
little nutmeg, and some parsley, chopped fine. 
Then one yelk of an egg, mixed in thoroughly on 



MEATS. 127 

the fire for half a minute. This stuffing is then 
inserted in the chicken. 

It is important in choosing poultry to ascertain, 
if possible, its age. A young fowl has smooth legs 
and combs. When old they are rough, and have 
long hairs on the breast. They should be plump- 
breasted, with fat backs, and have white or light 
yellow legs. 

Fowl Stewed with Onions. — Wash it clean, 
dry and truss it as for boiling ; put a little pepper 
and salt into it, rub it with butter ; butter a sauce- 
pan ; put the fowl in the pan with a pint of veal 
stock, or water, seasoned with pepper and salt. 
Turn it while stewing, and when quite tender add 
a dozen small onions, split. Stew all together for 
half an hour. A young fowl will take one hour, 
an old one three hours to stew. "-* '■''"'' 

Steamed Fowls. — Fowls are better steamed 
than boiled, especially when there is no veal' stock 
on hand to boil them in. When steamed, the juices, 
should be saved by placing a pan under the strainet 
to catch all the drips. Drawn butter, plain or sea- 
soned with parsley or celery, is the most common 
sauce used for boiled fowls. Liver sauce ife gobd'; 
but when oysters can be had, oyster sauce is to 1)6 
preferred above all others. 

Fowl Cutlets. — One fowl, one egg, pinch oi^ 
pepper and salt, a tablespoonful of gravy. Cut lirp 
a fowl, and bone it, form the legs, wings, breast, 
9 



128 MEATS. 

and merry-thought into six cutlets, flattening and 
giving them a good shape ; take the meat from the 
remainder of the fowl, and the liver, pound it in a 
mortar with pepper, salt, and a spoonful of gravy ; 
brush the cutlet over with an egg, spread the force- 
meat over them, egg again, and cover with fried 
bread crumbs, and fry them a light brown color ; 
serve with lemon rind and gravy in a separate dish. 

Choice Fowl, Pudding. — Take a cold fowl and 
mince it, cutting it into small square pieces. Make 
a white sauce with a small piece of butter, some 
flour, and cream or milk. Put the mince into the 
white sauce, and set it aside to cool. When quite 
cold, make up into balls. Cover them with egg 
and bread crumbs ; do this twice, to prevent them 
from bursting. At dinner-time, fry them in hot 
lard or dripping ; serve them up on a serviette ; 
garnish with parsley. 

To Bone Fowls for Fricassees, Curries, 
AND Pies, — First carve them entirely into joints, 
then remove the bones, beginning with the legs and 
wings, at the head of the largest bone; hold this 
with the fingers, and work the knife carefully all 
round it. The remainder of the birds is too easily 
done to require any instructions. 

To Roast a Fowl. — Having nicely dressed the 
fowl, have ready a dressing seasoned with pepper, 
salt, and summer savory; fill the body of the bird, 
sew up the opening, truss it nicely, oil it with butter, 



MEATS. 129 

and put it before a moderately hot but bright fire ; heal 
the skia evenly as soon as possible, cover it with 
paper if there is the least danger of its browning 
too soon, roast pretty fast, without scorching, the 
first half hour, and baste the fowl all over every 
five minutes; after this let it roast steadily, but 
rather slowly, three-quarters of an hour, when, if 
young and tender, it will be done quite through. 
Stick a fork through the breast and thighs, and if 
the fluid which follows the fork is entirely free 
from blood, it is done. If not browned, replenish 
the fire, wet the fowl over with very little yelk of 
egg, dust it lightly with flour, and let it brown 
evenly all over. Remove the skewers and strings 
before sending it to the table. 

To Bake a Fowl, — Prepare a fowl as for roast- 
ing ; have the oven of good but not a raging heat. 
Lay the fowl on skewers ; baste every five minutes, 
and manage the same as the roast. If young, it 
will bake in one hour. 

To Roast a Tuekey. — Proceed as directed in 
roast fowls ; allow from two and a half to three 
hours for a good-sized tender turkey. The dress- 
ings of fowls can be varied by using oysters, etc. 

To Bake a Turkey. — Follow the directions 
for baking fowls, and allow from two to two and a 
half hours steady baking for a common-sized young 
turkey ; serve with a browned gravy. All roast 
fowls sliould be served with dressed vegetables, 



130 . MEATS. 

currant, grape, or cranberry jelly, and a baked 
pudding or pie. 

Stuffing for a Turkey. — Take some bread 
crumbs and turn on just enough hot water to soften 
them ; put in a piece of butter, not melted, the size 
of a hen's egg, and a spoonful of pulverized sage, 
a teaspoonful of ground pej^per, and a teaspoonful 
of salt; there may be some of the bread crumbs 
that need to be chopped ; then mix thoroughly and 
stuff your turkey. 

Baked Turkey. — Let the turkey be picked, 
singed, and washed and wiped dry, inside and out ; 
joint only to the first joints in the legs, and cut 
some of the neck off if it is all bloody ; then cut 
one dozen small gashes in the fleshy parts of the 
turkey, on the outside and in different parts of the 
turkey, and press one whole oyster in each gash ; 
then close the skin and flesh over each oyster as 
tightly as possible ; then stuff your turkey, leaving 
a little room for the stuffing to swell. When stuffed 
sew it up with a stout cord, rub over lightly with 
flour, sprinkle a little salt and pepper on it, put 
some water in your dripping pan, put in your tur- 
key, baste it often with its own drippings ; bake to 
a nice brown ; thicken your gravy with a little flour 
and water. Be sure and keep the bottom of the 
dripping pan covered with water, or it will burn 
the gravy and make it bitter. 

Giblet Pie. — Wash and clean your giblets, put 



MEATS. 131 

fcliem in a stewpan, season Avith pepper, salt, and a 
little butter rolled in flour, cover them with water, 
stew them till they are very tender. Line the sides 
of your pie-dish with paste, put in the giblets, and 
if the gravy is not quite thick enough, add a little 
more butter rolled in flour. Let it boil once, pour 
in the gravy, put on the top crust, leaving an open- 
ing in the centre of it in the form of a square ; 
ornament this with leaves of the paste. Set the pie 
in the oven, and when the crust is done take it out. 

To Fricassee Small Chickens. — Cut off the 
wings and legs of four chickens; separate the 
breasts from the backs ; divide the backs crosswise ; 
cut off the necks; clean the gizzards; put them with 
the livers and other parts of the chickens, after be- 
ing thoroughly washed, into a saucepan ; add salt, 
pepper, and a little mace ; cover with water, and 
stew till tender. Take them up ; thicken half a 
pint of water with two spoonfuls of flour rubbed 
into four ounces of butter ; add a tumbler of new 
milk ; boil all together a few minutes, then add 
eight spoonfuls of white wine, stirring it in care- 
fully, so as not to curdle ; put in the chickens, and 
shake the pan until they are sufficiently heated; 
then serve them up. 

To Broil Chickens without Burning. — Re- 
move occasionally from the fire and baste with a 
gravy prepared as follows : Simmer together one- 
half cup of vinegar, a piece of butter the size of 



132 MEATS. 

an egg, and salt and pepper to the taste. Keep it 
hot to use. 

Chicken Pot-Pie. — Clean, singe, and joint a 
pair of chickens. Pare and slice eight white pota- 
toes ; wash the slices and put with the pieces of 
chicken into a stewpan lined with pie-crust ; season 
Avith salt and pepper, dredge with flour, and cover 
with water. Cover with paste, making a hole in the 
centre; cover the kettle, and either harig it over 
the fire or set it in the oven. If in the oven, turn 
occasionally to brown evenly. Two hours' cooking 
is sufficient. When done, cut the upper crust into 
moderate-sized pieces and place them on a large 
dish ; with a perforated ladle take up the potato 
and chicken, put it upon the crust ; cut the lower 
crust and put on the top. Serve the gravy hot in 
a gravy tureen. 

White Fricassee. — Boil a chicken; joint it; 
lay it in a saucepan with a piece of butter the size 
of an egg, a tablespoonful of flour, a little mace or 
nutmeg, white pepper, and salt. Add a pint of 
cream, and let it boil up once. Serve hot on toast. 

To Fry Cold Chicken, — Cut up the chicken, 
and take off* the skin, rub it with egg, cover it with 
seasoned bread crumbs and chopped parsley, ana 
fry in butter. Serve with brown gravy, thickened 
with flour and butter, and seasoned with Cayenne, 
mushroom catsup, and lemon pickle. Or, the 
chicken may be seasoned, and fried in plain butter. 



\ MEATS. 133 

Chicken Baked in Rice. — Cut a chicken into 
joints, as for fricassee, season it well with pepper 
and salt, lay it in a pudding-dish lined with slices 
of ham or bacon, add a pint of veal gravy, and an 
onion finely minced; fill up the dish with boiled 
rice, well pressed, and piled as high as the dish 
will allow ; cover with a paste ; bake one hour, and 
serve. 

Chicken Puffs. — Mince up together the breast 
of a chicken, some lean ham, half an anchovy, a 
little parsley, some shalot, and lemon-peel, and 
season these with pepper, salt, Cayenne, and beaten 
mace. Let this be on the fire for a few minutes, in 
a little good white sauce. Cut some thinly-rolled- 
out pufF-paste into squares, putting on each some 
of the mince, turn tlie paste over, fry them in 
boiling lard, and serve them. These puffs are 
very good cold, and they form a convenient supper 
dish. 

To Boil a Goose. — After it is well dressed, 
singe it thoroughly. Have ready a dressing pre- 
pared of bread crumbs, seasoned with pepper, salt 
and butter, with the addition of two finely-chopped 
onions, a little sage, and more pepper than would 
be used for turkey. Fill the body and close it 
firmly ; put it in cold water, and boil it gently an 
hour, if tender; if not longer; serve with giblet 
sauce. The onion can be omitted if not relished. 



134 MEATS. 

TO COOK PARTRIDGES. 

In making partridges ready for roasting leave the 
heads on, and turn them under the left wings ; cut 
off the tops of the toes, but do not remove the legs ; 
before a proper fire, twenty minutes' roasting will 
be ample for young partridges. After being shot, 
these birds should not be kept longer than from two 
days to a week. The plumage is occasionally 
allowed to remain upon the heads of the red 
partridges, in which case the heads require to be 
wrapped in paper. 

To KoAST Partridges. — Rightly to look well 
there should be a leash (three birds) in the dish ; 
pluck, singe, draw, and truss them ; roast them for 
about twenty minutes ; baste them with butter, and 
when the gravy begins to run from them you may 
safely assume that the partridges are done; place 
them in a dish, together with bread crumbs, fried 
nicely brown and arranged in small heaps. Gravy 
should be served in a tureen apart. 

To Broil Partridges. — Split them in half; 
do not wash them, but wipe their insides with a 
cloth ; dip thera into liquid butter, then roll them 
in bread crumb^s; repeat this process; lay them 
inside downwards, upon a well-heated gridiron, 
turn them but once, and when done serve them 
with a piquante sauce. If you do not employ butter 
and bread crumbs, a little Cayenne and butter 
should be rubbed upon them before they are 



MEATS. 135 

served. Cold roasted birds eat well if nicely 
broiled, and sent to table with a highly-seasoned 
sauce. 

Paeteidge Pie. — Two braces of partridges are 
required to make a handsome pie ; truss them as for 
boiling ; pound in a mortar the livers of the birds, 
a quarter of a pound of fat bacon, and some shred 
parsley; lay part of this forcemeat at the bottom of 
a raised crust put in the partridges, add the re- 
mainder of the forcemeat and a few mushrooms; 
put some slices of bacon fat on the top, cover with 
a lid of crust, and bake it for two hours and a half. 
Before serving the pie remove the lid, take out the 
bacon, and add sufficient rich gravy and orange 
juice. Partridge pie may also be made in a dish in 
the ordinary way. 

To Boil, Partridges. — Properly prepare the 
birds ; put them into plenty of boiling water ; do 
them quickly for fifteen minutes; make a rich sauce 
by adding an ounce of butter to half a pint of good 
thick cream; stir it one way over the fire till it 
is quite hot, and pour it into the dish with the 
partridges. 

To Stew Partridges. — Cut up the birds, after 
seeing that they are properly plucked, singed, etc. ; 
shake the following mixture over the fire until it 
boils ; an onion, sliced and pulled into rings, a piece 
of butter rolled in flour, and a tablespoonful each 
of water, wine, and vinegar; put in the partridge; 



136 MEATS. 

let it simmer very gently till done ; decorate the 
disli with small slices of toast; put into it the 
partridge, and pour the sauce over it. 

To Fey Partridges. — Take a brace of cold 
partridges that have been either roasted or braised ; 
cut them into quarters ; dip them into beaten and 
seasoned yelk of eggs ; make some butter or friture 
perfectly hot in a frying-pan ; put into it the birds, 
and do them over a moderately hot fire until they 
are beautifully browned. 

Quails Cured in Oil. — Procure a sufficient 
number of fine, plump quails. Pluck them, draw 
them, clean them thoroughly, cut them open so that 
they Avill lie flat, as for broiling, and rub them over 
with salt. Let them lie in the salt, turning them 
every morning, for three days. Let them dry ; and 
then pack them down close in a stone jar, covering 
each layer of quails tightly with fresh gathered vine 
leaves. Fill the jar with pure salad oil, and 
cover it securely with bladder, so as quite to exclude 
the air. When they are wanted, take them out 
and broil them. They make a delicious dish for 
breakfast. 

AVoOD(X)CK. — Woodcocks should not be drawn, 
as the trail is considered a " bonne bouche ;" truss 
their legs close to the body, and run an iron skewer 
through each thigh, close to the body, and tie them 
on a small bird spit ; put them to roast at a clear 
fire ; cut as many slices of bread as you have birds, 



MEATS. 137 

t»ast or fry them a delicate brown, and lay them 
in the dripping-pan under the birds to catch the 
trail ; baste them with butter, and froth them with 
flour ; lay the toast on a hot dish, and the birds on 
the toast ; pour some good beef gravy into the dish, 
and serve. 

Snipes differ little from woodcocks, unless in 
size ; they are to be dressed in the same way, but 
require about five minutes less time to roast them. 

• Wild Ducks. — For roasting a wild duck you 
must have a clear, brisk fire and a hot spit. It 
must be browned upon the outside without being 
sodden within. To have it well frothed and full of 
gravy is the nicety. Prepare the fire by stirring 
and raking it just before the bird is laid down, and 
fifteen or twenty minutes will do it in the fashion- 
able way ; but if you like it a little more done allow 
it a few minutes longer ; if it is too much it will 
lose its flavor. 

To Keep Game. — If there be any danger of 
birds not keeping, pick and draw them, wash them 
well in water, and rub them with salt. Plunge 
them singly into a large saucepan of boiling water, 
draw them up and down by the legs to let the water 
pass through them. After they have been in the 
water for five minutes hang them up to dry in a 
cold place, sprinkle them with pepper and salt well 
inside. Before dressing them they must be again 
washed. By this means the most delicate birds may 



138 MEATS. 

be preserved, with the exception of those which live 
bj suction, as they are never drawn ; but they may 
be kept a long time by putting lumps of charcoal, or 
placing a small quantity of mould in muslin bags 
in their insides. 

Venison Steaks. — Cut them from the neck; 
season them with pepper and salt. When the grid- 
iron has been well heated over a bed of bright coals, 
grease the bars and lay the steaks upon it. Broil 
them well, turning them once, and taking care to 
save as much of the gravy as possible. Serve them 
up with some currant jelly laid on each steak. 

Rabbit Pie. — Cut the rabbit into jo'nts. Take 
out the leg bones, which, with the head and breast 
bones well stewed, will make a good gravy. Put 
the joints of the rabbit into a pie-dish, with half a 
pound of salt pork in rashers, or a little ham or 
bacon, if preferred to the pork. Mix in a saucer a 
little flour, pepper and salt, pounded mace, and 
grated nutmeg. Sprinkle this mixture in, add half 
a pint of water, and cover with a suet, dripping, or 
butter crust, as you please. You may improve the 
pie by putting in forcemeat balls and hard-boiled 
eggs. Bake about an hour and a half; pour in the 
gravy you have made before serving. 

Roman Pie. — Boil a rabbit ; cut all the meat as 
thin as possible. Boil two ounces of macaroni very 
tender, two ounces of Parmesan or common cheese, 
grated, a little onion, chopped fine, pepper and salt 



MEATS. 139 

to taste, not quite half a pint of cream. Line a 
mould, sprinkled with vermicelli, with a good paste. 
Bake an hour and serve it either with or without 
brown sauce. Cold chicken or cold game may be 
used for this pie instead of a rabbit. 

POTTED FISH AND MEATS. 

The preservation of potted meats is mainly due 
to the exclusion of the air by the vessels in which 
they are inclosed, and the layer of fat with which 
the meat is covered. 

For home purposes we should always recommend 
butter to be employed for this purpose, and hence 
the first operation necessary in potting is the purifi- 
cation of that substance. 

Butter, as ordinarily made, contains a considera- 
ble quantity of curdy matter, derived from the cream. 
This, after a time, turns rancid, even in spite of all 
the salt that may be added ; and consequently the 
length of time that butter will keep is limited. By 
removing the curd, butter will keep a very great 
length of time without change. The only method 
by which this can be done is by clarifying. In 
some parts of Switzerland they put the butter into 
earthenware glazed vessels, these are placed in large 
saucepans of water and heated very gently until the 
contents melt, the greatest care being taken not to 
overheat the butter, and as soon as it becomes liquid 
the vessels are allowed to cool with the slightest 
agitation. In this manner all the impurities are got 



140 MEATS. 

rid of, some being lighter rise to the top, others, as 
the card, sink to the bottom. The pure butter so 
clarified will keep sweet for a long time, and it is in 
this condition that it should always be used in pot- 
ting. If butter is clarified in a saucepan over a fire, 
the curdy matter is certain to be overheated, and 
the whole mass becomes unpleasantly flavored. 

Clarified butter is better than suet or melted fat 
to pour over the top of the potted meats, as the suet 
in cooling cracks away from the pot and admits the 
air. This evil does not generally happen when 
butter is used. Having made these preliminary 
observations we will now give some receipts for 
potting meats, premising that small pots should 
generally be used for two reasons — firstly, the cov- 
ering of butter is less likely to crack wdien small 
pots are used than when large ones are employed ; 
and secondly, the contents are sooner eaten when 
opened, so that there is less chance of their being 
spoiled by exposure to the air. 

Any kind of meat — as beef, tongue, ham, chicken, 
etc., — may be potted if first baked or stewed until 
tender, and the fleshy parts pounded in a mortar 
with salt, such spices as may be approved, and a 
proportion of clarified butter. It should then be 
pressed firmly into the pots, melted clarified butter 
poured over it, and the pot tied down when cold 
In most cookery books a marble mortar is recom- 
mended. This is a mistake. There cannot be a 
much worse material used for mortars than marble. 



MEATS. 141 

It is soft, and, what is still worse, readily absorbeni; 
of grease and flavors, so after having been used for 
one substance, if high flavored, cannot be safely used 
for another. A good wedgewood-ware mortar, such 
as used by chemists, is the cheapest and best that 
can be employed. 

Many potted articles require special treatment, 
the directions for which we subjoin : 

Potted Salmon. — Split a salmon down the back, 
and divide it into two pieces, removing the back- 
bone, head, and tail. Wipe the two sides with a 
clean napkin, but do not wash them. Salt them 
slightly, and let them drain. Put the drained 
pieces into a baking pan, after having well rubbed 
them all over with a mixture of powdered cloves and 
mace and four or five bay leaves and some whole 
pepper. Cover the fish with cold clarified butter, 
and the pan with strong paper. AVhen baked take 
the salmon out and let it drain from the gravy. 
Take off the skin and put the fish into the pots. 
Sprinkle the upper surface of the potted salmon 
with a little spice, and pour clarified butter over it 
when cold ; then close the pots. 

Potted Lobster. — Boil the lobsters yourself. 
Choose hens in preference, on account of the spawn. 
When the lobsters are cold pick out all the parts 
that are eatable. Beat the flesh in a mortar, season- 
ing it with salt and a mixture of pepper, mace, and 
nutmeg, finely powdered. As you beat and mix it. 



142 MEATS. 

incorporate with the paste a small quantity of clari-i 
fied butter. Press the meat strongly into the pot- 
ting pots, and pour over it hot clarified butter. Lob- 
sters may also be potted by putting into the pots 
lumps of the meat, and pounding only the spawn, 
and filling up with clarified butter. 

Potted Rabbit. — Take off the legs and shoul- 
ders of the rabbits, also the fleshy parts of the back. 
Cut off the leg bones at the first joint, and the 
shoulder bones at the blades, but without cutting 
off the meat. Take also the livers, season these 
limbs and livers, put plenty of butter over them, 
and bake them gently; then stow them lightly into 
pots, covering them with clarified butter. The 
remainder of the rabbits may serve for any other 
purpose in the culinary arrangements of the day. 

Potted Pigeons. — Clean them well, bone them, 
season them in the usual manner, and lay them very 
close in a baking-pan. Cover them with butter, tie 
very thick paper over them, and put the pan into 
the oven. When cold put them, closely packed side 
by side, into pots that will hold three each, and 
cover them with clarified butter. 

Potted Birds. — Bake them in a pan under a 
crust, with plenty of seasoning and butter. When 
they are cold put as many in a pot as can be forced 
in side by side, and cover them with clarified butter. 

To Pot Veal. — Cold fillet makes the finest 
potted veal, or it may be done as follows : Season 



MEATS. 143 

a large slice of the fillet before it is dressed with 
some mace, pepper-corns, and two or three cloves ; 
lay it close into a potting-pan that will just hold it, 
fill it up with water, and bake it three hours. 
Then pound it quite small in a mortar, and salt to 
taste; put a little gravy that was baked to it in 
pounding, if to be eaten soon, otherwise only a little 
butter just melted; when done, cover it over with 
butter. 

Potted Calves' Feet. — Boil the feet for five 
hours; flavor half a pint of the jelley in which they 
are boiled with nutmeg, garlic, and pounded ham, 
and let them simmer together for a few minutes; 
cut up the feet into small piecas and season them ; 
dip a mould into cold water, and put in the meat, 
mixed with a little grated lemon-peel and minced 
parsley. Some persons add beet-root, baked or- 
boiled, cut in slices and mixed with the meat, 
when this is arranged in the mould, fill up with the 
flavored jelley. Turn out when quite cold. The 
remainder of the jelly in which the feet were boiled 
can be used as a sweet jelly. 

Potted Veal and Bacon. — Cut equal quanti- 
ties of veal and bacon into thin slices. Rub together 
some dried sweet-basil or summer-savory, very fine; 
lay in a stewpan a layer of bacon and a layer of 
veal, and on these sprinkle the powdered herbs, a 
little grated horseradish, pepper and salt. Put 
layers in the same order, seasoned, till all the meat 
10 



144 MEATS. 

is iu the pan. Squeeze over all the juice of a lemon, 
and grate on it the yellow rind. Cover very tightly 
and hake for three hours in a moderate oven, then 
take out and drain off all the gravy. Shake over 
the meat a little catsup, press under heavy weights 
for three hours, and put away in a tightly covered 
pot. 



CHAPTER V. 

VEGETABLES AND SALADS. 
VEGETABLES. 

Vegetables should be carefully cleaned from 
insects and nicely washed. Boil them in plenty of 
water, and drain them the moment they are done 
enough. If over-boiled they will lose their beauty 
and crispness. Bad cooks sometimes dress them 
with meat, which is wrong, except carrots or cabbage 
with boiling beef. 

In order to boil vegetables of a good green color, 
take care that the water boils when they are put in. 
Make them boil very fast. Do not cover, but 
watch them, and if the water has not slackened 
you may be sure they are done when they begin to 
sink. Then take them out immediately, or the 
color will change. Hard water, especially if chaly- 
beate, spoils the color of such vegetables as should 
be green. To boil them green in hard water, put 
a teaspoonful of carbonate of soda or potash into 
the water when it boils, before the vegetables are 
put in. 

To Boil Potatoes. — Pare or merely wash them, 
as preferred, and put them in a covered saucepan

of cold water, with a teaspoonful of salt ; boll tliera 
till they are done (which can be ascertained by 
running a fork into them) and begin to break a 
little ; then pour the water from them, and hold the 
saucepan with the lid off, over the fire for two or 
three minutes, shaking well at the end of the time ; 
put the lid loosely on so as to allow the steam to 
escape, and sprinkle a very little salt over them ; 
let them stand till wanted (the sooner the better), 
but they may remain in this way, if necessary, half 
an hour or more. Time, twenty to thirty minutes, 
or longer if very large. 

To Broil Potatoes. — Parboil, then slice and 
broil them. Or, parboil, and then set them whole 
on the gridiron over a very slow fire, and when 
thoroughly done send them up with their skins 
on. This last way is practised in many Irish 
families. 

Potato Chips. — Wash and peel some potatoes, 
then pare them, ribbon-like, into long lengths; put 
them into cold water to remove the strong potato 
flavor; drain them, and throw them into a pan 
with a little butter, and fry them a light brown. 
Take them out of the pan, and place them close to 
the fire on a sieve, lined with clean writing-paper, to 
dry, before they are served up. A little salt may 
be sprinkled over them. 

Steamed Potatoes. — Either peel them or not, 
according to their quality, but any rate wash them 



VEGETABLES AND SALADS. 147 

thoroughly ; put them into a steamer, cover them 
down closely, and place them over a saucepan of 
boiling water. Endeavor not to lift the lid until 
you have reason to suppose the potatoes are done. 
Unless of a very small size, potatoes usually require 
forty minutes or an hour's steaming. 

Baked Potatoes. — Potatoes are either baked in 
their jackets or peeled ; in either case they should 
not be exposed to a fierce heat, which is wasteful, 
inasmuch as thereby a great deal of the vegetable 
is scorched and rendered uneatable. They should 
be frequently turned while being baked, and kept 
from touching each other in the oven or dish. 
When done in their skins be particular to wash and 
brush them before baking them. If convenient, 
they may be baked in wood-ashes, or in a Dutch 
oven in front of the fire; serve them in damask 
napkin. When pared they should be baked in a 
dish, and fat of some kind added to j)revent their 
outsides from becoming burnt ; they are ordinarily 
baked thus as an accessory to baked meat, 

Pommes de Terre a la Danoies. — Peel six good 
large mealy potatoes, cut them into rather thin slices, 
and throw them into a saucepan of boiling water, 
do them quickly until they are tender enough to 
mash ; strain off the water and mash them smooth 
with a spoon, add some fresh butter or oil, salt^ 
pepper, chopped parsley, and grated nutmeg, 
together with two new-laid eggs. Stir all well, 



148 VEGETABLES AND SALADS. 

heat some very good butter or salad oil in a frying- 
pan, place in it spoonfuls of the potato, turn them 
as they become brown, drain them from fat, and 
serve very hot. When preferred, spoonfuls may be 
arranged upon a buttered dish and baked. 

Potato Surprise. — Take some good-sized cold, 
boiled potatoes, cut a piece from the end of each, 
and M'ith a round-topped knife remove a good deal 
of the inside of the potatoes; fill them with oysters, 
bearded, chopped, peppered, and mixed with raw 
egg ; replace the tops upon the potatoes, moistening 
the edges with raw egg to make them adhere 
together, and place the potatoes in a slack oven, 
while you prepare a batter, into which dip them, 
and afterwards fry them in lard ; when very nicely 
browned serve hot. Some pickled sauce may take 
the place of the oysters, if more convenient, or a 
few bread crumbs soaked in beaten egg. 

MiROTON OF Potatoes. — Peel and nicely steam 
eight good mealy potatoes ; when done, mash them 
and season them with pepper; chop up one medium- 
sized onion and the yelks of two hard-boiled eggs, 
fry them in plenty of oil or butter ; when the onion 
is quite tender drain it and the eggs from all fat, 
add them to the mashed potato, mix with them two 
raw eggs, and a dessertspoonful of catsup ; place 
all together in a mould buttered and sprinkled with 
bread cr.umbs ; bake for half an hour, and turn out 
of the mould to serve.

Potatoes Mashed and Fried. — What are 
called mashed potatoes should, to be properly made, 
be passed through the hair sieve, and then stirred 
up in a saucepan with milk, butter, and salt ; by 
this process you avoid coming upon pieces of hard 
potato. 

Another simpler mode is to pass the potatoes 
through the sieve, and, before they have time to 
cool, put them into a vegetable dish, with a lump of 
butter under them, keeping them, hot till the time 
of serving. 

With some dishes fried potatoes are de rigueur. 
To fry them well you must attend to the following 
points : Plenty of fat. Wait till the fat is very hot 
•before you throw them in. Let them be thoroughly 
dry, for, if at all damp, they will never be crisp. 
When they have got a fine golden tinge, take them 
out and lay them on a piece of blotting paper 
before the fire, giving them a good sprinkling 
of salt. Do not attempt to fry boiled potatoes ; 
they must be raw, and you can cut them either in 
dices the thickness of a shilling, or in pieces about 
the size of a French Bean and the length of the 
potato. 

Boiled potatoes can be warmed up by frying, 
and one very good way is to fry some shalots or 
onions, and, when they begin to take color, throw 
in the potatoes, any how, and keep turning them 
until warm. 

Cold mashed potatoes make excellent little side 



150 VEGETABLES AND SALADS. 

dishes, the simplest of which is this : Stir an egg 
or two with your potatoes ; add a few finely-pow- 
dered spices, pepper and salt to taste, and some 
minced parsley; mix well, and roll the mixture 
into balls, or any shape you like; cover with fine, 
bread crumbs, fry a nice golden color, and serve 
garnished with fried parsley. This dish can be 
varied ad infinitum, by either inserting in the mid- 
dle of each ball, or incorporating with the mixture, 
any of the following : The flesh of fowls or game, 
any kind of fish, lobsters, crabs, etc., all finely 
minced. If you have some very rich stock, moisten 
the minced meat or fish with it, and your dish will 
be improved ; only, in that case, you must put a 
small portion of the mixture in each ball, and not 
mix it up with the potatoes. The above combina- 
tions can be erected into a more imposing dish by 
placing the minced fish or meat in a pie-dish, and 
covering over with potatoes, then baking until the 
top is of the desired color ; in this case, however, a 
regular ragout should be made for the animal part 
of the dish, and the potatoes only play second 
fiddle. 

A favorite way of dressing potatoes is this : Cut 
them up into quarters ; rub a saucepan with a piece 
of garlic, put into it a goodly piece of butter, and 
when it is melted throw in your potatoes ; add a 
very little water, pepper and salt, and a small 
quantity, of grated nutmeg; let the whole simmer 
till done, and, before serving, add some minced 



VEGETABLES AND SALADS. 151 

parsley and a little lemon-juice. Cooked in this 
way they can be eaten as a separate dish. 

Boiled potatoes cut up into quarters, and with a 
white sauce, with minced parsley put over them, 
make a very nice dish. 

A delicious way of eating new potatoes is to put 
them into a saucepan with plenty of butter; toss 
them about till done, sprinkling with salt, and 
serving very hot. 

With potatoes a most excellent good, swefit dish 
can be made. It is made thus : Boil and pass 
through a hair sieve three or four potatoes; stir to 
them powdered sugar and the yelks of two eggs ; 
add a few drops of essence of vanilla, or any other 
essence ; beat up the whites of the two eggs into a 
froth, mix quickly and thoroughly with the pud- 
ding, pour into a shape (previously buttered and 
bread-crumbed) and bake in a quick oven for 
twenty minutes or less. This will be found a very 
effective dish. The only difficulty about it is the 
timing of the cooking thereof, as it requires to be 
taken up to table as soon as it is done, and the 
cook must know her company well to be able to 
judge how long they will take over the previous 
dishes. The preparing of this dish is very good 
practice for making souffles; and, in fact, if less 
potatoes are used and more eggs, you produce, with- 
out knowing it, a sowffli of pommes de terre, as it is 
called. 

Potato Rolls. — Wash some potatoes of a me- 



152 VEGETABLES AND SALADS. 

dium size, pare them, and cut them in the form of 
small rolls of about three inches in length and an 
inch and a half across ; dip them into beaten egg, 
have some thin slices of fat bacon large enough to 
envelop a potato ; wrap one in each rasher, arrange 
them in a small baking dish, put them into a mode- 
rately hot oven, and bake them until the potatoes 
are done ; rasp a little toast upon them, and serve 
them directly. 

Stewed Potatoes. — Cut into slices four cold 
potatoes that have either been boiled or steamed ; 
season them, dredge them with flour, and put them 
into a stewpan with some fresh butter or olive oil ; 
fry them slightly on both sides for five minutes, 
drain off the fat, pour upon them half a pint of 
good gravy nicely flavored, and let them stew by 
the side of the fire for twenty minutes. Serve to- 
gether with the sauce in which they were stewed. 

Beowned Potatoes. — Steam or boil some rather 
small-sized potatoes, peel them, and throw them 
into a stewpan of boiling butter ; shake them occa- 
sionally, and when done and well browned, serve 
them upon a thin slice of toast which has been 
dipped into either essence of anchovy, or catsup. 

Potato Fkitters. — Take seventeen large-sized 
Mercer potatoes, grate them finely ; when all are 
grated, add three eggs, three tablespoonfuls of flour, 
and one tablespoonful of salt ; mix it well. Drop 
into hot lard or butter and bake until done. 



VEGETABLES AND SALADS. 153 

New Potatoes — To Boil. — Procure them of 
equal size, and if very young, wash them only ; if 
older, rub off the skins with a scrubbing-brush or 
coarse cloth. Put them into boiling water till ten- 
der, and sprinkle a little salt over them, and put 
a lump of butter in ; shake up and serve. Time, 
fifteen to twenty minutes. 

Potato Salad is made with vinegar in the fol- 
lowing manner, viz. : Boil your potatoes, (select the 
smallest,) and, as soon as they are done, peel them 
as quick as you can ; cut them in small slices, and 
after seasoning them with salt and pepper, pour 
over them (while hot) five or six tablespoonfuls of 
vinegar to about one quart of potatoes, and turn 
them thoroughly. Cut a large onion very fine and 
put it in, still turning. Half an hour after, add 
three or four tablespoonfuls of sweet oil, and after 
turning again, serve. 

Potato Patties. — Butter some small patty-pans ; 
' strew bread crumbs over the insides and fill them 
with some nicely-mashed potatoes, flavored with 
either mushroom catsup, grated lemon-peel, or sav- 
ory herbs, chopped fine; add sufficient lard or fresh 
butter, and sift more bread crumbs on the tops ; 
place them in an oven till properly browned, lift 
them out of the patty-pans to serve. 

Potato Scones. — Mash boiled potatoes till they 
are quite smooth, adding a little salt; then knead 
out with flour, to the thickness required; toast,

pricking them with a fork to prevent them blister- 
ing. AVhen eaten with fresh butter, they are very 
nutritious. 

Potatoes in Meat, Puddings, and Pies. — • 
The introduction of a potato or two into family pud- 
dings is a generally acknowledged improvement, 
inasmuch as the farinaceous nature of the potato 
causes it to absorb fat, and thereby act as a correc- 
tive to the over richness of most meat pies and pud- 
dings. Potatoes are especially of advantage with 
beef or mutton, one or two to an ordinary sized 
pasty being sufficient. 

Roasted Potatoes. — Wash some good sized 
potatoes and boil them for ten minutes. Take them 
up and peel them, well butter them outside, sprinkle 
some salt and pepper upon them, and dredge them 
with a little flour ; arrange them in an oven and 
roast them before the fire, turning them as they 
require it. When thoroughly brown serve in a hot 
dish. \ 

Jury Pie. — Steam or boil some mealy potatoes, 
mash them together with some butter or cream, 
season them, and place a layer at the bottom of the 
pie-dish, upon this place a layer of finely chopped 
cold meat or fish of any kind, well seasoned, then 
add another layer of potatoes, and continue alternat- 
ing these with more chopped meat until the dish be 
filled. Smooth down the top, strew bread crumba 
upon it, and bake until it is well browned. A very 



VEGETABLES AND SALADS. 155 

small quantity of meat serves in this manner to 
make a nice presentable little dish. A sprinkling 
of chopped pickles may be added if handy, and when 
iish is employed it eats better if first beaten up with 
raw egg. Some dressed spinach, tomatoes, aspara- 
gus tops, etc., may be made use of in place of the 
meat, if convenient, but the potatoes should pre- 
dominate three-fourths more than the other ingre- 
dient introduced. 

Potato Croquettes, a Sweet Dish. — Take 
some nicely baked potatoes, scoop out the mealy 
part, and mash it thoroughly smooth ; press it 
through a sieve, make it into stiff paste with some 
cream, butter, orange flower water, powdered loaf- 
sugar, and raw eggs well beaten. Make it into cro- 
quettes by rolling portions in sifted bread crumbs, 
and dipping them in white of egg whipped to a snow. 
Fry them in plenty of lard or fresh butter. 

Potato Pone. — This is a favorite dish in the 
West India Islands. Wash, peel, and grate two 
pounds of potatoes, add four ounces each of sugar 
and butter (or beef dripping), melted, one teaspoon- 
ful each of salt and pepper, mix well together, place 
it in a baking-dish, and put it into a brisk oven 
until it is done and becomes nicely browned. 

Stuffed Potatoes. — Take five large potatoes, 
wash and peel them, and scoop them out, so as to 
have them hollow from end to end ; fill the holes 
with sausage or forcemeat, dip the potatoes into dis- 



156 VEGETABLES AND SALADS. 

solved butter, and arrange thera in a baking-dish. 
Put them into a moderately hot oven for about tliirty 
or forty minutes. Serve directly after they are done. 
They may be accompanied by a sauce or not, accord- 
ing to choice. 

PoMMES DE Teree EN Pyramide — Either steam 
or boil some very good mealy potatoes, mash them 
and put them into a stewpan, together with some 
butter, a little salt, and milk. As the mixture be- 
comes stiff add more milk, but let it be of the desired 
consistency to arrange it in the form of a pyramid 
in a buttered dish. Place it in a hot oven, or brown 
with a salamander, and serve. 

Potatoes Fried with Batter. — Nicely wash 
and pare some floury potatoes. Cut each into any 
form you fancy, such as a large lozenge, etc., then 
thinly slice' them, so that the pieces may" be of a uni- 
form shape. Dip them into either a sweet or savory 
batter, fry them in plenty of butter, and serve them 
quite hot, with either salt or pounded loaf-sugar 
strewn upon them. 

Potatoes a la Creme. — Put into a saucepan 
about two ounces of butter, a dessertspoonful of 
flour, some parsley, chopped small, salt, and pepper. 
Stir them up together, add a wineglassful of cream, 
and set it on the fire, stirring continually until it 
boils. Cut some boiled potatoes into slices and put 
them into the saucepan with the mixture^ boil all 
together, and serve them very hot. 



VEGETABLES AND SALADS. 157 

French Mashed Potatoes. — After well boil- 
ing some potatoes in their jackets peel, and mash 
them with a fork. Put them into a stewpan with 
some butter and salt, moisten them with fresh cream, 
and let them grow dry while stirring them over the 
fire ; add more cream, and so continue for nearly an 
hour. Dish them, and brown them on the top with 
a salamander. Serve directly. 

Savory Potato Cakes. — Quarter of a pound 
of gmted ham, one pound of mashed potatoes, and 
a little suet, mixed with the yelks of two eggs, pep- 
per, salt, and nutmeg. Roll it into little balls or 
cakes, and fry it a light brown. Sweet herbs may 
be used in the place of ham. Plain potato cakes 
are made with potatoes and eggs only. 

CAULIFLOWER. 

One of the prettiest dishes of vegetables we know 
consists of a cauliflower of ivory whiteness resting 
upon a bed of well made tomato sauce. To insure 
the immaculate appearance of the cauliflower, a 
moderate quantity of flour should be put in the 
water it is boiled in, and the cauliflower should only 
be put in \Yhen the water is boiling fast. When 
two or more cauliflowers are used, they should be 
moulded into one to serve them. To do this, when 
they are boiled, cut off the stalk, and dispose the 
pieces of cauliflower head downwards in a basin ; press 
them gently together, turn them out dexterously on 
a dish, and two or three small cauliflowers will by 



158 VEGETABLES AXD SALADS. 

this means present the appearance of one large one. 
Care must be taken to have the basin quite hot and 
to operate quickly. This cannot very well be done 
with the small purple cauliflower or brocoli ; but all 
the formulas given for cauliflowers proper may be 
applied to brocoli likewise. 

The sauce should be put into the dish and the 
cauliflowers over it ; but if the moulding process has 
not been successful, or if the cauliflowers are not 
very nice looking ones, then pour the sauce over 
them, so as to hide their deformity. 

The very best way, however, to treat cauliflowers 
is au gralin, and this has the advantage that it may 
be applied to the remains of the cauliflowers served 
at the dinner of the day before. This is the simplest 
form of it : Dispose the pieces of cauliflowers on a 
dish, pour a good supply of liquified butter over 
them, and plenty of grated cheese, with a judicious 
admixture of powdered white pepper, salt, and nut- 
meg. Put the dish into the oven for a few minutes, 
or brown with a red-hot salamander, and serve. 

Here are other modes of proceeding : Rub the 
dish very slightly with garlic, mould your cauli- 
flowers in a basin, and pour into them, before turn- 
ing them out, some melted butter, into which you 
have dissolved a good allowance of cheese; turn 
them out on the dish, strew plentifully with grated 
cheese, a few bread crumbs, pepper, and salt, pour- 
ing the remainder of the sauce over. Brown and 
serve. 



VEGETABLES AND SALADS. 159 

Instead of moulding the cauliflowers, dip each 
piece in the sauce, and dispose them flat on the 
dish, filling up the interstices with bread crumbs 
and cheese in equal parts; pepper and salt accord- 
ing to taste ; brown and serve. 

The great thing to be avoided is not to make these 
preparations too dry, and yet there should not be 
over much butter. The browning must be carefully 
done, so as to produce a surface of a uniform golden 
color — not in patches, some burnt black, and others 
not browned at all, as is too often the case in the 
preparations of the careless and hasty operators who 
preside in kitchens. 

To such people as may object to cheese, I can 
recommend the following receipt, which has great 
merit of its own : Dispose your pieces of boiled cau- 
liflower upon a dish well rubbed with garlic, over 
them strew a mixture of bread crumbs and ancho- 
vies, capers, and olives, mixed fine pepper, and salt ; 
over all pour a judicious quantity of fine salad oil. 
Bake for about ten minutes, and serve. 

Celery may be dressed according to the above 
formulas also; but we prefer treating the latter in 
the same way as asparagus, which it emulates in 
delicacy of flavor — i. e., by plain boiling in salt and 
water, and serving with some simple sauce. 

Boiled Cauliflower. — Soak the head two 
hours in salt water, and cook until tender in milk 
and water ; drain and serve whole with drawn but- 
ter. This makes the best appearance, but it will be 
11 



IGO VEGETABLES AND SALADfi. 

found to suit the taste better cut up and seasoned 
richly with butter and a little salt and pepper. In 
either case it must be well drained. 

Cauliflower Omelette. — After boiling a firm 
head of cauliflower allow it to grow cold, chop it very 
fine, mix it with sufficient well beaten egg to make 
a very thick batter. Fry brown in fresh butter, and 
serve hot. 

Cauliflower in Milk. — Choose those that are 
close and white, cut oft' the green leaves, and look 
carefully that there are no caterpillars about the 
stalk ; soak an hour in cold water, with a handful 
of salt in it ; then boil them in milk and water, and 
take care to skim the saucepan, that not the least 
foulness may fall on the flower. It must be served 
very white and rather crimp. 

Fried Cauliflower. — Having laid a fine 
cauliflower in cold water for an hour, put it into a 
pot of boiling water that has been slightly salted 
(milk and water will be still better,) and boil it 
twenty-five minutes, or till the large stalk is per- 
fectly tender. Then divide it equally into small 
tufts, and spread it on a dish to cool. Prepare a 
sufficient quantity of batter made in the proportion 
of a tablespoonful of flour, and two tablespoonfuls 
of milk to each egg. Beat the eggs very light ; 
then stir into them the flour and milk alternately ; 
a spoonful of flour, and one of milk and eggs ; 
season with pepper and salt. Dip the cold e:udi- 



VEGETABLES AND SALADS. 161 

flower into the batter, and fry each piece in butter 
and lard until brown. 

Corn Balls. — Grate five eara of partly dried 
corn, and powder it in a mortar. Roll the powder 
into small balls and boil them twenty minutes. 
Take them out of the water; cool them; mash them 
with some crushed white sugar and two eggs. 
Form again in balls and fry in boiling lard and 
butter. Sprinkle them with finely powdered sugar, 
and serve hot. 

Corn Oysters. — Grate the corn. To every 
pint, take three well beaten eggs, and sufficient 
flour to bind the mixture together. Season with 
salt, form in the shape of oysters, and fry brown in 
butter and lard. 

Corn in Cans. — Dissolve one ounce and a 
quarter of tartaric acid in half a pint of water. 
Cut the corn from the cob, and add sufficient water 
to cook it properly. When cooked, add two table- 
spoonfuls of the acid solution to every quart of corn. 
Can it immediately ; seal securely, and put it away 
in a cool, but not damp place. When wanted for 
use, stir half a teaspoonlul of soda through two 
quarts of corn, and let it stand three or four hours 
before cooking. This will remove all the acid taste, 
and render the corn as fresh as when cooked in the 
summer. 

Corn Porridge. — Take young corn, and cut 
the grains from the cob. Measure it, and to each 



Iij2 VEGETABLES AND SALADS. 

heaping pint of corn allow not quite a quart of 
milk. Put the corn and milk into a pot, stir them 
well together, and boil them till the corn is perfectly 
soft. Then add some bits of fresh butter dredged 
with flour, and let it boil five minutes longer. 
Stir in at the last some beaten yelk of egg, and in 
three minutes remove it from the fire. Take up 
the porridge, and send it to table hot, and stir 
some fresh butter into it. You may add sugar and 
nutmeg. 

Succotash. — If old beans are used, they must 
be soaked over night, and parboiled in two waters 
before putting in the pork. The corn should be 
added to the beans and pork about fifteen minutes 
before the hour for serving the dinner. It is well to 
boil the cobs with the beans and pork in the last 
water. Remove them before adding the corn. For 
using beans not fully ripe, one change of water is 
sufficient ; the pork can be parboiled at the same 
time. Beans for succotash should remain whole; 
care must be taken that they boil gently, so as not 
to break them. Considerable water is generally 
used in boiling the beans, that no more need be 
added when the corn is put in ; most persons like 
considerable soup in this dish. Families can be 
governed by taste in this. Dish the corn and 
beans in a deep dish with the froth, and season 
with butter and a very little salt: use no pep- 
per; if any person desires it, it is easily added. 
Serve the pork on a platter, after taking off the 



VEGETABLES AND SALADS. 163 

skin and dotting it with pepper, by dipping the 
little finger in ground pepper and pressing it on the 
pork. 

Green Corn Dumplings. — A quart of young 
corn grated from the cob, half a pint of wheat flour 
sifted, half a pint of milk, six tablespoonfuls of 
butter, two eggs, a saltspoonful of salt, a saltspoonful 
of pepper, and butter for frying. Having grated 
as fine as possible sufficient young fresh corn to 
make a quart, mix with it the wheat flour, and add 
the salt and pepper. Warm the milk in a small 
saucepan, and soften the butter in it. Then add 
them gradually to the pan of corn stirring very 
hard, and set it away to cool. Beat the eggs light, 
and stir them into the mixture when it has cooled. 
Flour your hands and make it into little dumplings. 
Put into a frying-pan a sufficiency of fresh butter 
(or lard and butter, in equal proportions), and when 
it is boiling hot, and has been skimmed, put in the 
dumplings, and fry them ten minutes or more, in 
proportion to their thickness. Then drain them, 
and send them hot to the dinner table. 

Corn Fritters. — One dozen ears of young 
corn grated ; one pint of new milk or rich cream, 
two eggs, a little salt and flour sufficient for a stiif 
batter. Fry brown in butter and lard. 

Broiled Tomatoes. — Wash and wipe the 
tomatoes, and put them on the gridiron stem down. 
Set the sridiron over a clear fire. When brown on 



164 VEGETABLES AND SALADS. 

one side, tn:-!i them; let them cook through. 
Pepper, salt, and serve on a hot dish, with a small 
piece of butter on each tomato. 

Tomato Fritters. — Take one quart of stewed 
tomatoes, stir in one egg, one small teaspoonful of 
saleratus or soda, and flour enough to make it the 
consistency of jiancakes. 

Browned Tomatoes. — Take large round toma- 
^ toes and halve them ; "place them, the skin side 
down, in a frying-pan in which a very small 
quantity of butter or lard has been previously 
melted ; sprinkle them with salt and pepper and 
dredge them well with flour ; place the pan on a 
hot part of the fire, and let them broivn thoroughly ; 
tlien stir them and let them brown again, and so 
on until they are quite done. They lose their 
acidity, and the flavor is superior to stewed to- 
matoes. 

Tomato Soup. — Wash, scrape, and cut- small tlie 
red part of three large carrots', three heads of celery, 
four large onions, and two large turnips; put them 
into a saucepan, with a tablespoonful of butter and 
half a pound of lean new ham ; let them stew very 
gently for an hour ; then add three quarts of browa 
gravy soup and some whole black pepper, with eight 
or ten ripe tomatoes ; let it boil an hour and a half, 
and pulp it through a sieve ; serve it with fried 
bread cut in dice. 

Tomato Toast. — Remove the stem and all the 



vegetabt.es and salads. 165 

Beeds from the tomatoes ; they must be ripe — ^but 
not over ripe; steAv them to a pulp, season with 
butter, pepper and salt ; toast some bread, butter it, 
and then spread the tomato on each side, and send 
it up to table two slices on each dish, the slices cut 
in two, and the person who helps it must serve 
with two half slices, not attempt to lift the top slice, 
otherwise the appearance of the under slice will be 
destroyed. 

To Bake Tomatoes. — Season them with salt 
and pepper ; flour them over, put them in a deep 
plate with a little butter, and bake in a stove. 

Breakfast Tomatoes. — Tliis is a nice break- 
fast dish ; prepare the tomatoes, and stew them. 
Toast a slice of light bread for each member of the 
family, and spread the stewed tomatoes evenly on 
each slice. If any is left, pour it over the whole ; 
serve immetliately. 

Chinese Rice. — The process of boiling one 
pound of rice is as follows: Take a clean stew- 
pan, with a close-fitting top, then take a clean piece 
of white muslin, large enough to cover over the top 
of the pan and hang down inside nearly to, but not 
in contact with, the bottom. Into the sack so 
formed place the rice, pour over it two cupfuls of 
water, and put on the top of the stewpan, so as to 
hold up the muslin bag inside, and fit tight all 
round. Place the pan on a slow fire, and the steam 
generated from the water will cook the rice. Each 



166 VEGETABLES AND SALADS. 

grain, it is stated, will come out of the boiler as dry 
and distinct as if just taken from the hull. More 
water may be poured into the pan if necessary, but 
only sufficient to keep up the steam till the rice is 
cooked. The pan nuist not be heated so hot as to 
cause the steam to blow off the lid. 

Carolina Rice. — Pick the rice carefully, and 
wash it through two or three cold waters till it is 
quite clean. Then (having drained off all the water 
through a colander) put the rice into a pot of boil- 
ing water, with a very little salt, allowing as much 
as a quart of water to half a pint of rice ; boil it 
twenty minutes or more. Then pour off the water, 
draining the rice as dry as possible. Lastly, set it 
on hot coals with the lid off, that the steam may 
not condense upon it and render the rice watery. 
Keep it dry thus for a quarter of an hour. Put it 
into a deep dish, and loosen and toss it up from the 
bottom with two forks, one in each hand, so that 
the grains may appear to stand alone. 

Rice and Milk. — To every quart of good milk 
allow two ounces of rice ; wash it well in several 
waters ; put it with the milk into a closely-covered 
saucepan, and set it over a slow fire ; when it boils, 
take it off; let it stand till it is cold, and simmer it 
about an hour and a quarter before sending it to 
table, and serve it in a tureen. 

String Beans for Winter Use. — String them 
and cut them in small pieces as if for boiling ; put 



VEGETABLES AND SALADS. 167 

them raw in stone jars, in alternate layers, with 
coarse table salt, each layer about one inch in thick 
ness, leaving a layer of salt at the top, tying paper 
over the whole. During the winter use the beans, 
(boiling and seasoning them in the ordinary way, 
after soaking them in cold water for twelve hours,; 
and they prove quite equal to the best beans cooked 
fresh from the vine. The appearance and flavor 
are precisely the same. 

To Cook Beans in a French Style. — Choose 
small young beans, and strip oif the ends and stalks, 
throwing them, as prepared, into a dish full of cold 
spring water, and, when all are finished, wash and 
drain them well. Boil them in salted boiling water, 
in a large saucepan, and drain them, after which 
put them into an enamelled stewpan, and shake 
them over the fire until they are quite hot and dry; 
then add about three ounces of fresh butter, and a 
tablespoonful of veal or chicken broth ; the butter 
must be broken up into small lumps. Season with 
white pepper, salt, and the juice of half a lemon 
strained. Stir them well over a hot fire for five 
minutes, and serve them in a vegetable dish very 
hot. 

String Beans. — Gather them while young 
enough to break crispy ; break of both ends, and 
string them ; breark in halves, and boil in water 
with a little salt, until tender ; drain free from 
water, and season with butter. 



168 VEGETABLES AND SALADS. 

Boiled Beans. — Soak over night any small 
white beans in soft water, put them in a strong bag, 
leaving room to swell ; let them boil in a potful of 
water until done; hang them up to let all the water 
drain off, and season with butter, pepper, and salt, 
to the taste. 

Parsnips require a good deal of boiling. When 
young wipe off the skin after they are boiled ; when 
old boil them with salt meat, and scrape them first. 
(Parsnips should always be scraped.) Average time, 
from twenty to forty-five minutes. 

Broiled Parsnips. — After they are boiled ten- 
der let them become perfectly cold. Slice thin 
lengthwise, and broil until nicely browned ; spread 
them with butter, and season with pepper and salt. 
To be served with roast, broiled, or fried meats. 

Parsnip Cutlet. — Slice boiled parsnips length- 
wise, and brown them in lard, after rubbing them 
with pepper and salt. When browned on both sides, 
dip one side in batter made of egg and flour, let 
them brown, not burn, then dip the other side, and 
brown in the same manner ; spread over them a lit- 
tle butter, or not, as desired. Serve with roasts, etc. 

Parsnip Fritters, No. 1. — Boil and peel two 
large parsnips, scrape tliem to a fine pulp, beat them 
up with the whites of two and the* yelks of four eggs, 
t\vo spoonfuls of cream, half a glass of sherry, and 
a little grated nutmeg. Beat all together for nearly 



VEGETABLES AND SALADS. 169 

half a^a hour until the batter becomes light. Fry them 
well covered with lard, aud serve with lemon or 
orange-juice and sugar, or with sweet or wine sauce. 

Parsnip Fritters, No. 2, — Boil the parsnips, in 
salted water, so as to flavor them through. Make 
a light batter, cut them round, and dip them in the 
batter. Have ready hot lard, take them up with a 
a tablespoon, and drop them in while the lard is 
boiling. When they rise to the surface turn them ; 
when browned on both sides take them out. Let 
them drain, and set them in the oven to keep hot. 
Serve with broiled, fried, or roast meats or fowls. 

Fricassee of Parsnips. — Boil in milk till they 
are soft, then cut them lengthwise into bits two or 
three inches long, and simmer in a white sauce 
made of two spoonfuls of broth, a bit of mace, half 
a cupful of cream, a bit of butter, and some flour, 
pepper and salt. 

Fried Plantains or Bananas. — Buy some 
sweet plantains, or bananas. If not thoroughly ripe, 
hang them up in the room to ripen. Take off the 
skins, cut in slices, and fry in hot lard until browned. 
The long, green, hard, plantains are peele-d and 
roasted in the ashes, when it closely resembles 
bread. It is also cut in slices and fried a nice brown 
in hot lard. They are also boiled in soups, stews, 
hashes, etc. 

Vegetables and Sauces. — Potatoes are good 



170 VEGETABLES AND SALADS. 

with all meats. With fowls they are nicest mashed. 
Carrots, parsnips, turnips, greens, and cabbage are 
eaten with boiled meat ; and beets, peas, and beans 
are appropriate to either boiled or roasted meat. 
Mashed turnip is good with roasted pork. To- 
matoes are good with every kind of meat, but 
especially so with roast ; apple sauce with roast 
pork ; cranberry sauce with beef, fowls, veal, and 
ham. Currant jelly is used by many persons with 
roast mutton. Pickles are good with all roast meats, 
and capers or nasturtiums with boiled lamb or mut- 
ton. Horseradish and lemons are excellent with 
veal. 

CarJiots. — Let them be well washed and brushed, 
not scraped. An hour is enough for young spring 
carrots. Grown carrots must be cut in half, and 
will take from an hour and a half to two hours and 
a half. When done rub oif the peels with a clean, 
coarse cloth, and slice them in two or four, according 
to their size. The best way to try if they are done 
enough is to pierce them with a fork. 

Carrot Fritters. — These very nice fritters are 
simply made, and we can recommend them as being 
an agreeable variety for a side dish at a small party. 
Beat two small boiled carrots to a pulp with a spoon, 
add three or four eggs, and half a handful of flour. 
Moisten with cream, milk, or a little white wine, 
and sweeten to taste ; beat all well together, and fry 
them in boiling lard. When of good color take 



VEGETABLES AND SALADS. 171 

them off and serve, having squeezed over them the 
juice of an orange, and strewed them over with 
finely sifted sugar. 

Parsley and Butter. — Wash and tie up a 
bunch of parsley. Put it in boiling water, and let 
it boil for five minutes. Drain it, cut off the stalks, 
and chop the leaves very fine. Put it into the 
melted butter, which may be made by smoothly 
mixing a tablespoonful of flour with half a pint of 
water and two ounces of butter. Stir all one way ; 
let it boil about two minutes. 

Fried Artichokes. — Cut the artichokes into six 
or eight pieces, according to their size, remove the 
choke and the large leaves which will not become 
tender, and trim off the tops of the remainder of the 
leaves with a pair of scissors. Wash them in sev- 
eral waters, drain them, and dip them in a batter 
made with flour, a little cream, and the yelk of an 
egg. Let the artichokes be well covered with the 
batter, and fry them in lard. Sprinkle a little salt 
over them, and serve them on a bed of parsley. fried 
in the lard which remains in the pan. 

Summer Squashes. — When these vegetables are 
fresh, the rind will be crisp when cut by the nail. 
If very young and tender they may be boiled whole, 
if not pare them. Extract the seeds and strings, 
cut them small, put them in a stewpan with water 
enough just to cover them, add one teaspoonful of 
salt to each common sized squash, boil them till the 



172 VEGETABLES A>CD SALADS. 

pieces break, half an hour is generally enougli, and 
then press them through a colander with a skim- 
mer. Mix them with butter to your taste, and a 
little salt if necessary. 

Stewed Spinach. — Pick the spinach very clean, 
and wash thoroughly through several waters. Drain 
it and put it in a saucepan with only the water that 
clings to it. Add salt and pepper and stew for 
twenty minutes, or till quite tender. Turn it often 
while stewing and press it down with a wooden 
spoon or ladle. When done, drain and press as 
dry as possible; chop it up fine; set it again over 
the fire; add to it some pieces of butter rolled in 
flour, and the beaten yelks of two eggs. Simmer 
five minutes, and take it off without allowing it to 
boil. Serve upon thin slices of well-buttered toast 
cut in small squares. 

Spinach to Boil. — Spinach requires a great 
deal of water to free it ft-om the grit in which it is 
covered from its low growth. The stalks should 
be broken off, and the spinach washed well with 
the hand. Put it into a saucepan with a little salt. 
A very large quantity of uncooked spinach is needed 
to make a dish, as it wastes considerably in cooking. 
Boil it for about twelve niinutes, pressing it down 
when quite tender. Drain it thoroughly and squeeze 
out tlie water. Chop it quite small. Put it into a 
fresh saucepan with some butter, and stir it till it is 
hot. Spinach is frequently dished around minced 



VEGETABLES AND SALADS. 173 

meats; it is also sometimes served with poached 
eggs upon it. 

Boiled Onions. — Take the outside skin from 
white onions as uniform in size as possible, lay them 
in cold salt and water one hour, boil them in milk 
and water until thoroughly tender ; lay them in a 
deep dish, and pour over them melted butter. 

Buttered Onions. — Peel enough small onions 
to fill a vegetable dish ; throw them into a stewpan 
of boiling water ; add a little salt and a piece of 
fresh butter. Stew for five minutes. Drain them; 
put them into a saucepan with a large piece of 
butter, some pepper, nutmeg and salt. Toss them 
about over a clear fire until they begin to brown ; 
add a tablespoonful of gravy^ and a dessertspoonful 
of chopped herbs. Stew gently for fifteen minutes, 
and serve upon cream toast. 

Roasted Onions. — These should be cooked in 
their skins; but before putting them into the oveu, 
brush off all grittiness. Place in a moderate oven, 
cooking gradually until nearly done, then quicken 
the oven and brown. Serve with plenty of fresh 
butter. 

Flaked Onions. — Boil two good-sized Spanish 
onions in plain water, put aside until cold. Flake 
on two forks; season to taste. Make some butter 
very hot in a frying-pan, put the onions into it, 
and toss over the fire till brown. Drain, and serve 
on toast with parsley. 



174 VEGETABLES AND SALADS. 

Onions and Caper Sauce, — Boil a dozen large 
onions in milk, do not press them, but simply drain 
them ; put them immediately into a vegetable dish, 
and pour over them a good caper sauce made quite 
hot. This is the proper way of serving onions with 
a dish of boiled mutton. 

Stewed Celery. — Wash the celery very clean, 
and cut it to the length that it will lie evenly in a 
saucepan. Cover it with water, but do not use 
more than necessary. Salt the water rather freely. 
Let the celery boil from a quarter of an hour to 
twenty-live minutes, according to the size of the 
heads. Drain it, and serve it on toast as you 
would asparagus. A tureen of melted butter should 
be served with it, or some persons prefer white 
sauce. 

Fried Celery. — Is prepared as follows : Cut 
off the green tops of six or eight heads of celery, 
aiid remove the outside stalks. Wash them well 
and pare the roots clean. Have ready half i pint 
of white wine, the yelks of three egg* finely beaten, 
and a little salt and nutmeg, and mix them all well 
together with some flour into a batter. Dip every 
head into this batter, and fry them in butter. 
When sufficiently done, lay them in a dish and 
pour melted butter over them. 

Essence of Celery. — This is prepared by 
soaking for a fortnight a half ounce of the seeds 
of celery in a quarter of a pint of brandy. A few 



VEGETABLRS AND SALADS. 175 

drops will flavor a pint of soup or broth, equal to a 
head of celery. 

Vegetable Oyster Cakes. — Select good, 
large-sized oyster plant roots, grate them, and add 
milk and flour sufiicient to make a stiff batter, 
about a gill of grated oyster plant, two eggs, one 
pint of milk, and flour to make the batter, and salt. 
Drop it by tablespoonfuls into hot lard. Bake till 
brown. 

Egg Plant. — Select long purple if possible ; the 
next best is the round kind with prickles on the 
stem. Peel and slice them, spread salt on each 
separate piece, and lay them in a colander to drain; 
let them lie one hour, parboil, and fry them, until 
thoroughly cooked, in pork fat or butter'; egg 
plants, unless well cooked, are insipid, and even 
disgusting; they must be cooked through and 
browned. 

Boiled Beets. — Beets must not be cut before 
boiling, as the juice will escape and the sweetness 
be destroyed. Select small-sized, smooth roots, wash 
them nicely, and boil in clear water until tender. 
When sufficiently cooked, skim them into a pan of 
cold water, and slip off the skin. Cut them in 
thin slices, and while hot, season with butter, salt, 
pepper and vinegar, and serve. If preferred cold, 
slice lengthwise and lay in strong cold vinegar. 

Asparagus. — Set a stewpan with plenty of water 
in it on the fire ; sprinkle a handful of salt in it ; 
12

let it bt)Il,and skim it; then put in your asparagus, 
prepared thus : Scrape all the stalks till they are 
perfectly clean ; throw them into a pan of cold 
water as you scrape them; when they are all done, 
tie them up in little bundles, of about a quarter of 
a hundred each ; cut off the stalks at the bottom 
that tiiey may be all of a length, leaving only just 
enough to serve as a handle for the green part; 
when they are tender at the stalk, which will be 
from twenty to thirty minutes, they are done 
enough. Great care must be taken to watch the 
(exact time of their becoming tender ; take them up 
just at that instant, and they will have their true 
flavor and color; a minute or two moi"e boiling de- 
stroys both. While the asparagus is boiling, toast 
some bread about lialf an inch thick ; brown it 
delicately on both sides; dip it lightly in the liquor 
the asparagus was boiled in, and lay it in the mid- 
dle of a dish ; melt some butter, then lay in the 
asparagus upon the toast, which must project be- 
yond the asparagus, that the company may see there 
is a toast. Pour no butter over them, but send some 
up in a deep dish. 

Stewed Asparagus. — Use it as soon as possible 
after cutting; there are several ways of cooking 
this, each of which is good. Discard all not brittle 
enough to break easily, tie it in small bunches, and 
boil it in very little water, slightly salted, until 
tender; take off the strings, put it in a covered 
dish, add butter to the water sufficient to make a 



VEGETABLES AND SALADS. 177 

rich gravy, and thicken it with very little flour, arid 
pour the gravy over the asparagus ; be careful to 
lay the heads all one way. 

Asparagus Soup. — Gut the asparagus in pieces 
a half inch long, boil in water with a little salt, 
and add rich sweet cream to thicken the soup. 

Asparagus Toast. — Tie the stalks in small 
bunches, boil them in very little salted water until 
tender ; toast as many slices of bread as there are 
bunches of asparagus, butter them while hot, lay a 
bunch on each slice of toast, add a little butter to 
the water, and pour it over the whole. 

Asparagus Omelette. — Boil some tender, 
freshly-cut asparagus in a very little water, slightly 
salted, or steam till tender. Chop up very fine ; 
beat with it the yelks of six and the whites of three 
eggs, (which must be beaten separately till light;) 
add two tablespoonfuls of sweet cream. Fry in 
butter, and serve hot. 

Turnips a la Poulette, — Cut the turnips into 
dice in a saucepan ; boil till tender, and drain. 
Put in the saucepan a piece of butter rolled in 
flour, and stir gently" over the fire ; add a gill of 
milk, stir again ; ]mt in the turnips, pepper, and 
salt. Stew five minutes, and serve. 

Turnips. — Full-grown turnips will take about 
an hour and a half gentle boiling; if you slice them, 
which most people do, they will be done sooner; try 
them witli a fork ; when tender, take them up, and 



178 VECETAET.ES AND RAT, ADS. 

}ay tlieni on a sieve till the water is tlioroughly 
drained from them. Send them up whole ; do not 
slice them. 

Turnip Tops. — Boil thoroughly, with plenty of 
water, salt, and soda in due proportions ; drain and 
pass through a hair sieve. Melt a piece of butter, 
to which add a little flour and the pulp of your 
turnip tops; stir on the fire a few minutes, adding 
a little milk or cream, and a little broth or stock, 
wdth pepper or grated nutmeg to taste. When a 
nice consistency, not too thick, dress on a dish as 
you would spinach, and serve with fried sippets of 
bread around it. If properly cooked, this dish has 
a better color than spinach, and a very pleasant, 
nutty, bitter taste. 

To Boil Peas. — They should be young and of 
a good sort. Must not be over-done, nor in much 
water. Boil some mint with them, and chop it to 
garnish them, and stir a piece of butter in with 
them. If either too young or too old, a little 
sugar boiled with them is an improvement. 

Green Peas. — Put into a stewpan a quart of 
peas, one onion, two ounces of butter, a sprig of 
mint, a teaspoonful of white sugar, and two table- 
spoonfuls of gravy ; stew till soft, when take out 
the onion and mint, and thicken with flour and 
butter. A lettuce is sometimes stewed with them. 

IvETTUCE Peas. — Ilaving washed four lettuces 
and stripped off the outside leaves, take the hearts 



VEGETABLES AND SALADS. 179 

and chop them up very fine ; put them into a stew- 
pan with two quarts of freshly-shelled green peas, 
a few lumps of loaf sugar and a few leaves of green 
mint, finely minced. Add a slice of cold ham, and a 
quarter of a pound of butter, divided into four 
pieces and rolled in flour, two tablespoonfuls of 
water and a pinch of black pepper. Let all stew 
for half an hour, or longer, if the peas are not ten- 
der. Take out the ham and add half a pint of 
cream. Stew five minutes longer, and serve hot. 

To Stew Peas. — Take a quart of shelled peas, 
a large onion, or two of middling size, and two 
lettuces cut small ; put them into a saucepan with 
half a pint of water; season them with a little 
salt, a little pepper, mace, and nutmeg. Cover 
them close, and let them stew a quarter of an hour, 
then put in a quarter of a pound of fresh butter 
rolled in a little flour, a spoonful of catsup, and a 
small piece of butter as big as a nutmeg ; cover 
them close, and simmer gently an hour, often shak- 
ing the pan. 

Peas au Sucre. — ^Boil the peas and throw into 
cold water, then put them in a pan with a little 
butter, a tablespoonful and a half of sugar, a table- 
spoonful of broth, one yelk of egg ; stir fast, and 
they are done. 

Cabbage Boiled with Meat. — Select for 
boiling, small white cabbages with firm heads ; cut 
these in quarters, and wash perfectly clean. Lay 



180 VEGETABLES AND SALADS. 

the pieces in salted water for an hour. Skin the 
fat from the pot when the meat is boiling, and put 
in the cabbage, an hour before the meat is done; 
drain well before serving. 

To Stew Cabbage. — Parboil in milk and 
water, and drain it, then shred it, put it into a 
stewpan, with a small piece of butter, a small 
teacupful of cream, and seasoning, and stew tender. 
Or, it may be stewed in white or brown gravy. 

Cold Cabbage, — Chop fine and heat it in 
vinegar, season with pepper and salt ; if not boiled 
with meats, add a little butter. It can also be fried ; 
cauliflower and brocoli can be prepared in the same 
manner. 

Dressing for Cold Slaw, — To the well-beaten 
yelk of one egg, add a little milk, two or three 
tablespoonfuls of vinegar and a small piece of 
butter. Stir it over the fire till it comes to a boil. 

Red Cabbage Stewed. — After slicing a small 
red cabbage, and washing it perfectly clean, put it 
into a saucepan with pepper, salt and butter, and 
whatever water clings to the leaves from washing. 
Let it stew until perfectly tender ; add two s})()on- 
fuls of vinegar and boil up once. Or, shred the 
cabbage, wash it, and put it in a saucepan over 
a slow fire, with slices of onion, a little gravy, 
pepper and salt. When quite tender, add a piece 
of butter rolled in flour, three spoonfuls of vinegar, 
and boil up once before serving. 



VEGETABLES AND SALADS. 181 

Stewed Cabbage. — Parboil in milk and water 
drain, shred, put it in a etewpan with a small piece 
of butter rolled in flour, a small teacup of cream ; 
season and stew till tender. Or, stew in meat 
gravy. 

Cabbage Jelly. — Boil cabbage in tfee usual 
way ; squeeze it in a colander till dry, and chop 
very fine. Add a little butter, pepper, and salt. 
Press all closely into an earthen mould, and bake 
one hour. Turn out of the mould and serve. 

Hot Slaw. — Cut cabbage into fine shreds; 
boil it in clear water until it is perfectly tender. 
Mix in a saucepan a teacupful of sharp vinegar, a 
piece of butter, salt and pepper ; stew gently for 
five minutes. Drain the cabbage, place it in a 
deep dish, pour the dressing over it, and serve hot. 

Broiled Mushrooms. — A Breakfast, Luncheon, 
or Supper Dish. Mushroom-flaps, pepper and salt 
to taste, butter, lemon-juice. Cleanse the mush- 
rooms by wiping them with a piece of flannel and a 
little salt; cut oif a portion of the stalk, and peel 
the tops ; broil them over a clear fire, turning them 
once, and arrange them on a very hot dish. Put a 
small piece of butter on each mushroom, season 
with pepper and salt, and squeeze over them a few 
drops of lemon-juice. Place the dish before the 
fire, and when the butter is melted, serve very hot 
and quickly. Moderate-sized flaps are better suited 
to this mode of co"bking than the buttons ; the latter 
are better in stews. 



182 VEGETABLES AND SALADS. 

Stewed Mushrooms. — One pint of mushroom 
buttons, three ounces of fresh butter, wl)ite pepper 
and sal< to taste, lemon-juice, one teaspoonful of 
flour, cream or milk, quarter of a teaspoonful of 
grated nutmeg. Cut off the ends of the stalks, and 
pare neatly a pint of mushroom buttons ; put them 
into a basin of water, with a little lemon-juice, as 
they are done. When all are prepared, take them 
from the water with the hands, to avoid the sedi- 
ment, and put them into a stewpan with the fresh 
butter, wliite pepper, salt, and the juice of half a 
lemon ; cover the pan closely, and let the mush- 
rooms stew gently from twenty to twenty-five 
minutes ; then thicken the butter with the above 
proportion of flour, add gradually sufficient cream, 
or cream and milk, to make the sauce of a proper 
consistency, and put in the grated nutmeg. If the 
mushrooms are not perfectly tender, stew them for 
five minutes longer, remove every particle of butter 
which may be floating on the top, and serve. 

To Dry Mushrooms. — Wipe them clean, take 
away the brown part and peel off the skin ; lay 
them on sheets of paper to dry, in a cool oven, 
when they will shrivel considerably. Keep them 
in paper bags, which hang in a dry place. When 
wanted for use, put them into cold gravy, bring 
them gradually to simmer, and it will be found 
that they will regain nearly their usual size. 

Preserving Mushrooms for Winter Use.— 



VEGETABLES AND SALADS. 183 

Peel small some freshly-gathered mushrooms, cut 
off the stems, and scrape out the whole of the fur, 
then arrange the mushrooms singly on tins or 
dishes, and dry them as gradually as possible in a 
moderately-heated oven; put them into tin canisters 
and store them in a dry place. 

Another way. — Wash large buttons, lay them 
on sieves, with the stalks upwards, sprinkle salt 
over them to extract the water; when they are 
drained put them into a saucepan and set them in 
a cool oven for an hour, then ta.ke them out care- 
fully and lay them by to cool and drain ; boil the 
liquor which comes out of them with a little sauce 
until reduced to half the quantity. Put the mush- 
rooms into a clean, dry jar, and when the liquor is 
cold, cover the mushroom in the jar with it and 
pour boiling suet over it; tie the jar well down 
with bladder and store it in a dry closet. 

Okra Stewed. — Cut into small, round slices, 
and to a quart add a wineglass of hot water, a table- 
spoonful of butter, into which has been rubbed a 
teagpoonful of flour ; salt and pepper to taste ; put 
into a covered stewpan and stew until tender, shak- 
ing occasionally. 

Okra Fried. — Strain a quart already boiled, 
mash it smooth, and season with salt and pepper; 
beat in one or two eggs and add flour enough' to 
thicken into a paste ; fried as fritters, and served 
upon a napkin hot, as fried.

Okka to DiiY FOR Winter Use. — Use only 
the young and tender ones, quarter and string them 
in a dry place, they must be soaked half a day 
before cooking. 

Cucumber Salad. — To one hundred cucumbers 
add a quarter of a peck of small onions. Peel both 
and cut them into thin slices : cover with salt, and 
stand in the sun for six hours ; rinse clean, and 
stand in clear cold water for one hour. For the 
dressing take a box of the best mustard, put into it 
a little salt, pour in sufficient olive oil to stir it 
easily, add vinegar, and oil alternately till thin 
enough to pour smoothly. Put the cucumbers in 
jars, cover with the dressing, and cover closely. 
Seal the jars. 

Salad Dressing without Oil. — Take the 
yelks of two fresh eggs, boiled hard, mash them in 
a plate with a silver fork, and a saltsj^oonful of salt, 
and two spoonfuls of mustard ; rub the whole well 
together. Add by degrees three spoonfuls of fresh 
cream and two of good vinegar, stirring all the time 
until quite smooth. 

Salad Dressing. — Beat together one raw egg 
and a saltspoonful of salt until smooth. Then in- 
corporate with it a teaspoonful of mustard, made 
rather thicker than usual. When these are quite 
smooth add, by degrees, one, two, or three table- 
spoonfuls, or even more, of good salad-oil, taking 
care to blend each portion of it with the egg before

adding more. This ought to make anj quantity, 
up to a teacupful, of a tenacious mass so thick that 
a teaspoon will stand up in it, and as smooth as 
lioney. Dilute it with vinegar till it assumes the 
(X)nsistence of thick cream. No salad mixture is so 
smooth and rich as this, and at the same time the 
original oily flavor is completely lost, from the raw 
egg converting the oil into an emulsion. A little 
anchovy may be added if desired. 

Italian Salad Dkessing. — Peel two well 
boiled potatoes and rub through a sieve, add a few 
shreds of raw onion, and the pounded yelks of two 
hard-boiled eggs. Mix these ingredients on a deep 
plate with two teaspoonfuls of salt, one of made 
mustard, three tablespoonfuls of olive oil, and one 
tablespopnful of vinegar ; add, lastly, a teaspoonful 
of essence of anchovy, mash and mix the whole 
together thoroughly. Having cut up a sufficiency 
of lettuce (previously well washed in cold water and 
drained), add to it the dressing immediately before 
dinner, mixing with a wooden fork. 

Salad. — Look over carefully the tender half 
blanched leaves of head-lettuce, and cut them 
slightly. Make a dressing of the yelks of hard- 
boiled eggs, mixed mustard, black pepper, butter, 
and vinegar. Slice three hard-boiled eggs, lay them 
upon the lettuce, and pour the sauce over the whole. 

Potato Salad. — To make a potato salad the 
potatoes must be boiled and cold, cut in slices with

salt, pepper, oil, vinegar, and a little parsley. ISIix 
the sauce, stew gently five minutes, and pour over 
the potatoes. 

Chicken Salad. — Mince the white meat of a 
cliicken fine, or pull it in bits ; chop the white parts 
of celery; prepare a salad dressing thus: Rub the 
yelks of hard-boiled eggs smooth with a spoon, put 
to each yelk a teaspoonful of made mustard, half as 
much salt, a tablespoonful of oil, and a wineglass of 
strong vinegar ; put the celery on a large dish, lay 
the chicken on that, then pour it over the dressing. 
Lettuce, cut small, in the place of celery, may be 
used. Cut the whites of the eggs in rings to garnish 
the salad. Turkey meat prepared in the same 
way makes almost as good a dish. 

Lobster Salad. — Boil the fish for half an hour, 
afterwards rubbing the shell with oil ; preserve this 
with the coral to garnish the dish. Extract the 
meat, and lay carefully on some nice white lettuce 
in the centre of the dish. Make a dressing of two 
hard-boiled eggs rubbed smooth in two tablespoon- 
fuls of vinegar ; add one tablespoonful of English 
mustard, three of salad oil, one of white powdered 
sugar, a teaspoonful of salt, some of black pepper, 
one pinch of Cayenne, and ihe yelks of two raw 
eggs ; mix together and pour over the fish, dressing 
with cut hard-boiled eggs, the coral, and the clawa 
and selected parts of the shell. 

English Salad Sauce. — Pound in a mortar 
the hard-boiled yelk of an egg ; mix with it a salt- 



VEGETABLES AND KALADS. 187 

spoonful of salt, a tablespc manful of ground mustard, 
a mashed mealy potato, two dessertspoonfuls of 
cream, a tablespoonful of olive oil, and a tablespoon- 
ful of vinegar. 

Sweet Salad Sauce.— Mix together two table- 
spoonfuls of olive oil, the raw yelk of an egg, a lit- 
tle pepper, one tablespoonful of the best vinegar, a 
pinch of salt, and a dessertspoonful of moist sugar. 

Swiss Salad Deessing. — Pound in a mortar 
two ounces of cheese, add a tablespoonful of vinegar, 
a small quantity of salt and pepper, and, by degrees, 
dilute it with olive oil. 

PiQUANTE Sauce for Salads. — Two hard- 
boiled yelks of eggs, two raw yelks of eggs, mashed 
smooth, with a tablespoonful each of cream and 
olive oil ; add sufficient vinegar to make it pretty 
sharp. 

Mayout^^aise for Salad. — Beat together the 
juice of a lemon and the raw yelks of two eggs; 
then slowly drop in enough olive oil to make a thick 
cream, stirring gently and continuously while add- 
ing tht oil. Vinegar may be used instead of lemon- 
juice. 



CHAPTER VI. 

PUDDINGS AND PASTRY. 
PUDDINGS. 

A few general remarks respecting the various in- 
gredients of which puddings are composed, may be 
acceptable as preliminary to the receipts in this de- 
partment. 

Flour should be of the best quality, and perfectly 
dry, and sifted before being used ; if iu the least 
damp, the paste made from it will certainly be 
heavy. 

Baiter, unless fresh is used, should be washed 
from the salt, and well squeezed and wrung in a 
cloth, to get out all the water and buttermilk, which, 
if left in, assists to make the paste heavy. 

Lard should be perfectly sweet, which may be 
ascertained by cutting the bladder through, and, if 
the knife smells sweet, the lard is good. 

Suet should be finely cliopped, perfectly free from 
skin, and quite sweet ; during the process of chop- 
ping, it should be lightly dredged with flour, which 
prevents the pieces from sticking together. Beef 
suet is considered the begt, but veal suet, or the out- 
side fat of a loin or neck of mutton, makes good 
188 



PUDDINGS AND PASTRY. 189 

crusts, as also the skimmings in which a joint of 
mutton has been boiled, but without vegetables. 

Clarified Beef Dripping answers very well for 
kitchen pies, puddings, cakes, or for family use. A 
very good short crust may be made by mixing with 
it a small quantity of moist sugar ; but care must be 
taken to use the dripping sparingly, or a very dis- 
agreeable flavor will be imparted to the paste. 

The freshness of all pudding ingredients is of 
much importance, as one bad article will taint the 
whole mixture. 

When the freshness of eggs is doubtful, break 
each one separately in a cup before mixing them all 
together. Should there be a bad one amongst them, 
it can be thrown away ; whereas, if mixed with the 
good ones, the entire quantity would be spoiled. 
The yelks and whites beaten separately make the 
articles they are put into much lighter. 

Raisins and dried fruits lor puddings should be 
carefully picked, and, in many cases, stoned. Cur- 
rants should be well washed, pressed in a cloth, and 
placed on a dish before the fire to get thoroughly 
dry; they should then be picked carefully over, 
and every piece of grit or stone removed from 
amongst them. To plump them, some cooks pour 
boiling water over them, and then dry them before 
the fire. 

Batter pudding should be smoothly mixed and 
free from lumps. To insure this, first mix the flour 
with a very small proportion of milk, and add the 



190 PUDDINGS AND PASTE V, 

remainder by degrees. Should the pudding be very 
bimpy, it may be strained througli a hair sieve. 

All boiled puddings should be put on in boiling 
wafer, which must not be allowed to stop simmer- 
ing, and the pudding must always be covered with 
the water ; if requisite, the saucepan should be kept 
filled up. 

To prevent a pudding boiled in a cloth from 
sticking to the bottom of the saucepan, place a small 
plate or saucer underneath it, and set the pan on a 
trivet over the fire. If a mould is used, this precau- 
tion is not necessary, but care must be taken to 
keep the pudding well covered with water. 

For dishing a boiled pudding as soon as it comes 
out of the pot, dip it into a basin of cold water, and 
the cloth will then not adhere to it. Great expedi- 
tion is necessary in sending puddings to table, as, 
by standing, they quickly become heavy, batter 
puddings particularly. 

For baked or boiled puddings, the moulds, cups, 
or batiins should be always buttered before the mix- 
ture is put in them, and they should be put into the 
saucepan directly after they are filled. 

Scrupulous attention should be paid to the clean- 
liness of pudding-cloths, as, from neglect in this par- 
ticular, the outsides of boiled puddings frequently 
taste very disagreeable. As soon as possible after 
it is taken off the pudding, it should be soaked in 
water, and then well washed without soap, unless 
it be very greasy. It should be dried out of doors, 



PUDDINGS AND PASTRY. 191 

then folded up, and kepi in a dry place. When 
wanted for use, dip it in boiling water, and dredge 
it slightly with flour. 

The dry ingredients for puddings are better for 
•being mixed some time before they are wanted; the 
liquid portion should only be added just before the 
jiudding is put into the saucepan. 

A pinch of salt is an improvement to the gener- 
ality of puddings ; but this ingredient should be 
added very sparingly, as the flavor should not be 
detected. 

When baked puddings are sufficiently solid, turn 
them out of the dish they were baked in, bottom 
uppermost, and strew over them, fine sifted sugar. 

When baked puddings are not done through, and 
yet the outside is sufficiently brown, cover them 
over with a piece of white paper until thoroughly 
cooked ; \this prevents them from getting burnt. 

All batter puddings fall soon after they are baked. 
They ought to be served immediately after they are 
done. Indian puddings require long and slow 
baking. Rice should be baked quickly. Tapioca 
and other puddings of the kind should bake in a 
moderate oven like custards. All cake puddings 
should be baked in the same manner as cakes of 
nearly the same composition ; as, for instance, sponge 
puddings quick, and plum puddings a long time. 

St. Claire Pudding. — Boil one quart of milk 
with sugar and lemon-peel to taste, and a pinch oi* 
powdered cinnamon; add one ounce of disyolved

192 PUDDINGS AND PA8TRY. 

isinglass or gelatine. When boiling, add the yelks 
of four eggs, well beaten. Fill a mould ; stand it 
in water and boil fifteen minutes. Put it on the 
ice for two hours. Make a sauce of sugar and wine, 
thickened with a little arrowroot, and stand also on 
the ice. Pour over the pudding when it is turned 
out of the mould. 

Ice Pudding. — Take one pint of cream, lialf a 
pint of milk, the yelks of four eggs, one ounce of 
sweet almonds pounded, and half a pound of sugar; 
put them in a stewpan on a gentle fire, and stir the 
mixture until the cream sets about the consistency 
of custard. When cold, add two wineglasses of 
brandy; freeze, and when sufficiently congealed, 
add one pound of preserved fruits, with a few cur- 
rants ; cut the fruit small, and mix well with the 
ice. Let it remain to set in the moulding pots, and 
keep it in ice till required for the table. 

Half-fay Pudding. — Quarter pound of suet, 
quarter pound of currants, quarter pound of rai- 
sins, quarter pound of flour, quarter pound of bread 
crumbs, two tablespoonfuls of molasses, half a pint 
of milk. Chop the suet finely ; mix Avith it the 
currants (which should be nicely washed and dried), 
the raisins (which should be stoned), the flour, bread 
crumbs, and molasses ; moisten with the milk, beat 
up the ingredients until all are thoroughly mixed, 
put them into a buttered basin, and boil the pu<]-- 
dina: for three and a half hours. 



PUDDINGS AND PASTRY. 193 

Minute Pudding. — Mix five tablespoonfuls of 
flour with half a pint of cold sweet milk, a very 
little salt, one-fourth of a nutmeg; stir it into a

the eggs stiff, beat in a tcacupful of sugar in which 
lias been strained the juice of the lemon, spread 
over the pudding a layer of jelly, pour the whites 
of the eggs over this ; replace in the oven ; bake 
lightly. To be eaten cold, with cream, if preferred. 

Gray Pudding. — Take three eggs, weigh them 
in the shell ; take an equal weight of sugar and of 
butter, and two-thirds of the weight of flour. Half 
melt the butter, and beat it to a cream ; beat the 
eggs also, and mix them with the butter and sugar, 
beating the whole to a froth ; then add the flour 
and the rind of a lemon, grated ; beat all together 
and pour it into a mould. An hour will boil it. 

Cottage Pudding. — A pound and a quarter of 
flour, fourteen ounces of suet, a pound and a quar- 
ter of stoned raisins, four ounces of currants, five 
of sugar, a quarter pound of potatoes smoothly 



194 PUDDINGS AUD PASTP.Y. 

mashed, half a nutmeg, a (quarter teaspoonful of 
ginger, the same of salt, and of cloves in powder ; 
mix the ingredients thoroughly ; add four well 
beaten eggs with a quarter pint of milk, tie the 
pudding in a well-floured cloth, and boil it for four 
hours, 

Soyer's New Christmas Pudding. — This re- 
ceipt, if closely followed, would, at this festive sea- 
son of the year, save tons of fruit and other expen- 
sive ingredients, which are partly wasted for the 
want of knowing how to turn them to the best ad- 
vantage. This pudding will be found sufficient for 
eight persons after a Christmas dinner. Carefully 
prepare the following, previous to mixing the pud- 
ding : Four ounces of stoned raisins, four ounces 
of sultanas, half a pound of well-cleaned currants, 
half a pound of beef suet chopped fine, two ounces 
of powdered white sugar, two ounces of flour, half 
a pound of bread crumbs, twelve bitter almonds 
blanched, chopped small, half a nutmeg grated, two 
ounces of candied citron, the peel of half a small 
lemon chopped fine, separately, put in a basin, 
break over four eggs, and add half a gill of brandy. 
Mix these all well the evening before wanted, cover 
over till the morning, and when all is prepared, add 
half a gill of milk, again well stir your pudding ; 
slightly butter a cloth, sprinkle a little flour over, 
put it in a basin, pour in the mixture, tie your 
cloth in the usual way, not too tight ; put in half 
a gallon of boiling water, add more now and then, 



PUDDINGS AND PASTRY. 195 

if required ; let it simmer two hours and thirty 
minutes, turn out of the cloth and serv^on a hot 
dish. Serve plain, if preferred, or with the sauce 
only. After wliich, when at the dining-room door, 
pour round a gill of either brandy or rum, wiiioh 
set on fire with a piece of paper; place the dish on 
the table, let burn half a minute, and pour the fol- 
lowing sauce over from the sauce-boat; after which 
cut seven or eight slices from the pudding cross- 
wise, or according to number, when help, and serve 
very hot. The sauce I prefer with it is as follows : 
Make half a pint of ordinary plain melted l)utter, 
rather thick, add to it two teaspoonfuls of sugar, 
the juice of half a lemon, and a pat of butter; stir 
quickly, pour over your pudding when very hot, 
or serve the sauce separately in a sauce-boat. 
Though the above pudding is not very expensive, 
it requires a little time and attention to do it prop- 
erly; and well will be repaid the housewife who 
will take the trouble, as above described. In the 
event of some of the ingredients, such as almonds, 
candied orange or lemon-peel, not being obtainable 
in some country places, the pudding will still be 
good, although not so delicate in flavor. 

Christmas Pudding. — One pound of raisins, 
one pound of currants, one pound of suet, three- 
quarters of a pound of bread crumbs, one pint of 
milk, ten eggs, three-quarters of a pound of citron

of brandv. Stone the raisins and divide thcia, 



106 PUDDINGS AND PASTRY. 

wash and dry the currants, and cut the peel into 
sh'ces. Mix all these with the bread crumbs, flour 
and suet, chopped very fine ; add the grated nut- 
meg, and then stir in the eggs well beaten, tlie 
brandy, and the milk. When the ingredients are 
well blended, put it into a mould, tie a floured 
cloth over it, and boil it six hours. When done 
turn it out, and serve it with brandy and arrowroot 
sauce. 

Plum Pudding. — Four eggs, about one dozen 
crackers, one pint of new milk, one teacup of but- 
ter, half a pound of sugar, one pound of raisins, one 
])0und of prunes, a grated nutmeg. Bake about an

in a cloth, and boil it for five hours or five hours 
and a half, or divide it into equal parts, and boil it 
in moulds or basins for half the time. 

Cottage Plum Pudding. — A pound and a 
half of flour, four or five eggs, a pinch of salt, a 
little nutmeg, one pound of raisins, half a pound 
of currants, sugar to taste, and a little milk. Make 
a thick batter with five well beaten eggs, a pound 
and a half of flour, and a sufficient quantity of milk. 
Then add the currants, washed and picked, the rai- 
>sins stoned, a little nutmeg, and sugar to taste.

Unrivalled Plum Pudding. — Two and a 
half pounds of raisins, one and three-quarters of a 
poimd of currants, two pounds of the finest moist 
suo;ar, two pounds of bread crumbs, sixteen eggs, 
two pounds of finely-chopped suet, six ounces of 
mix candied peel, the rind of two lemons, one 
ounce of ground nutmeg, one ounce of ground 
ciunamon, half an ounce of pounded bitter almonds, 
quarter of a pint of brandy. Stone and cut up the 
raisins, but do not chop them ; wash and dry the 
cun-ants, and cut the candied peel into thin slices. 
Mix all the dry ingredients well together, and 
moisten them with the eggs, which should be well 
beaten and strained; then stir in the brandy, and, 
when all is thoroughly mixed, well butter and 
flour a stout new pudding cloth ; put in the pud- 
ding, tie it down very tightly and closely, boil from 
six to eight hours, and serve with brandy sauce. 
This quantity may be divided and boiled in buttered 
moulds. For small families this is the most desir- 
able way, as the above will be found to make a 
pudding of large dimensions. 

Christmas Plum Pudding. — A pound of suet, 
cut in pieces not too fine, a pound of currants, and 
a pound of raisins stoned, four eggs, half a grated 
nutmeg, an ounce of citron and lemon-peel, shred 
fine, a teaspoonful of beaten ginger, half a pound of 
bread crumbs, half a pound of flour, and a pint of 
milk ; beat the eggs first, add half the milk, beat 
them together, and by degrees stir in the flour, then 



PUDDINGS AND PASTRY. 199 

the suet, spice, and fruit, and as much milk as will 
mix it together very thick ; then take a clean cloth, 
dip in boiling water, and squeeze dry. Wiiile the 
water is boiling fast, put in your pudding, which 
should boil at least five hours. 

Apple Pudding. — Pare four or five large tart 
apples, grate them fine ; then make the following 
custard, into which stir the grated apple : Flour, 
four tablespoonfuls; one pint of milk, five eggs, 
and a little grated orange-peel. After you have 
these ingredients well mixed, pour them into your 
pudding-dish, and bake about one hour and a 
quarter. 

Boiled Apple Pudding, — Make a butter-crust, 
or a suet one, using for a moderate-sized pudding 
from three-quarters to one pound of flour, with the 
other ingredients in proportion. Butter a basin ; 
line it with some of the paste; pare, core and cut 
the apples into slices, and fill the basin with these ; 
add sugar to taste, flavor with lemon-peel and juice, 
and cover with crust; pinch the edges together, 
flour the cloth, place it over the pudding, tie it 
securely, and put it into plenty of fast-boiling water. 
Let it boil from one and a half to two and a half 
hours, according to the size ; then turn it out of the 
basin, and send it to table quickly. Apple puddings 
may also be boiled in a cloth without a basin ; but, 
when made in this way, must be served without 
the least delay, as the crust so soon becomes heavy. 



200 PUDDINGS AND PASTRY. 

Baked Apple Pudding. — Four large apples 
boiled, some grated bread, four ounces of butter, 
four yelks and two whites of eggs well beaten, sugar

grit ; pare, core and chop the apple, and grate the 
bread into fine crumbs, and mince the almonds. 
Mix all these ingredients together, adding the sugar 
and nutmeg; beat up the eggs, omitting the whites 
of three; stir these to the pudding, and when all is 
well mixed add the brandy, and put the pudding 
into a buttered mould ; tie down with a cloth, 
put it into boiling water, and let it boil for three 
hours. 

Pippin Pudding. — Boil six apples well; take 
out the cores, put in half a pint of milk thickened

Beat the ingredients together, put a pufl-paste 
around your dish, and bake it. 

Apple E,oll. — Make a paste with one-fourth 
of a pound of butter to one of flour mixed with 
water, not very stiff. Peel and slice rather thick, 
tart apples, roll the paste very thin, or as thin as the 
bottom crust of a pie; spread the apples on the crust, 
so as to cover it, dredge on a little flour, and roll it 
as tight as possible. Cut the ends even, and put it 
in the steamer, or wrap it in thick cloth and boil it. 
It will take one hour steady cooking. Serve with 
butter and sugar; cut it in thin slices from the end 
when serving. 

CocOANUT PuDDiNCJ — Half a pound of loaf- 
sugar, half a pound of butter, half a cocoanut, 
grated, the whites of six eggs, one tablespoonful of 
rose water, two tablespoonfuls of brandy. Pare 
the brown skin off the nut, wash it in cold water, 
wipe it dry, and grate it. After the butter has 
been prepared as for lady-cake, and the sugar 
pounded fine, beat them to a cream ; whisk the 
whites of the eggs until stiff and dry, and add to 
the butter and sugar; stir the whole well together^ 
and add gradually the nut, brandy and rose-water — • 
then stir well, but do not heat it. Bake on rich 
pastry, without a top crust. 

Fine Cocoanut Pudding. — Pare the dark rind 
from one cocoanut and grate the meat. Break into

forty minutes. Serve with the following wine 
sauce : One cup of butter, one cup of sugar ; stir 
to a cream ; then one cup of wine added slowly. 
Put the bowl into a vessel of hot water, one half 
hour before using it. It must not be stirred. 

Cocoanut Cup Puddings. — Melt two ounces of 
butter, cut small, stirring in two ounces of sifted 
sugar; boil up for a minute. When cool, grate in 
two ounces of cocoanut, add two ounces of shred 
citron, the grated rind of a lemon, and four eggs ; 
beat with the juice of half a lemon. Mix, and ])ut 
into well-buttered coffee cups, and bake half an 
hour. The same may be made as one pudding in 
a dish, and baked longer.

very fine, and sweeten to your taste ; line a dish 
with very h'ght puff-paste, pour in the mixture, and 
bake half an hour. 

Excellent Lemon Pudding. — Beat the yelks 
of four eggs ; add four ounces of white sugar, the 
rind of a lemon being rubbed with some lumps of 
it to take the essence ; then peel, and beat it in a 
mortar with the juice of a lemon, and mix all with 
four or five ounces of butter warmed. Put a crust 
into a shallow dish, nick the edges, and put the 
above into it. When served, turn the pudding out 
of the dish. 

Iced Lemon Pudding. — Quarter of a pound of 
butter, half a pound of sugar, the yelks of five eggs, 
one quart of milk, one lemon, the rind grated an<l

Baked Sponge Pudding. — Cream together a

to bind the pudding together. Then take one 
pound of fine bread crumbs, and not quite a quarter 
pound of sugar; beat two eggs in a teacupful of 
milk, and mix all well together ; boil four hours. 
If you choose, serve it with wine or brandy sauce, 
and ornament it with blanched almonds. Simply 
cooked, however, it is better where there are chil- 
dren, with whom it is generally a favorite. We

as you like ; but add the spice before the milk and 
eggs. 

Raisin Pudding. — Soak two ounces of raisins

ful not to let one spice predominate ; a half pound

a quarter of a pound of citron, chopped fine. Let 
it stand until light in the pudding-dish ; bake care- 
fully, so as not to form a heavy crust; turn it out 
when baked, and pour over it while hot a rich wine 
sauce. This will be found excellent. It must be

other ingredients, and allow it to rise again.

strew a little fine sifted sugar over the top and serve. 
The mould may be ornamented with stoned raisins, 
arranged in any fanciful pattern, before the mixture

appearance of the pudding. For a plainer pudding- 
double the quantities of the bread crumbs; and if 
the eggs do not moisten sufficiently use a little milk.

new milk, add some sugar and cinnamon, pour it 
over the bread, and M'hen nearly cold, beat three 
eggs and pour into the dish. Bake for half an hour 
in a moderately heated oven. 

Steamed Bread and Butter Pudding. — Lay

them into a saucepan, with salt and a little lemon- 
peel ; put it on the fire and stir all well whilst you 
add a piece of fresh butter and a little cream and 
sugar. When quite hot, take the saucepan from the 
fire, let the mixture cool a little, and then add a 
tablespoonful of orange flower water, four whole 
eggs, and the yelks of four more. Mix all well 
together, and put into a mould which has previously 
had a slight coatino; of butter and bread crumbs. 
Bake it, and bring it hot to table. 

Syllabub Pudding. — Well beat your eggs, add 
to them six ounces of pounded and sifted loaf sugar, 
a glass of brandy, a glass of white wine, and suffi- 
cient flour to make it a very stiif batter. Have a 
quart of milk, warm from the cow, ])oured upon it 
while you continue beating, and when it is well 
frothed, put it into a buttered dish, place it in a quick 
oven, and bake it for a (piarter of an hour. Serve 
immediately. 

Bird's Nest Pudding. — Peel tart apples, take 
out the cores, leaving the ap])!es whole. Make a 
custard of eight well beaten eggs, half a pint of 
cream, and a pint and a half of scalded milk, thick- 
ened with a heaping tablespoonful of flour and a 
little salt, but no sugar ; pour it over the apples. 
Bake twenty minutes. When the apples are tender 
the pudding is done. Serve immediately with but- 
ter and sugar, stirred to a cream. 

Omnibus Pudding. — Haifa pound of flour, half 



PUDDINGS AND PASTRY. 225 

a pound of beef suet, half a pound of currants, half 
a pound of raisins, stoned, half a pound of sugar, 
half a pound of scraped raw potatoes, and quarter 
of a pound of scraped carrots, mixed together, and 
spice to taste. Boil four hours. 

BiDDLE Pudding. — One pint of milk, four large 
tablespoonfuls of flour, four eggs. Butter the bake- 
dish, put it in the oven wlien you are about to dish 
the dinner, allowing twenty-five minutes for baking. 
Bring it directly from the oven to the table, or it 
falls. 

Sauce for the Above. — One cup of brown 
sugar, two tablespoonfuls of cream, one ounce of 
butter. Stir the butter and sugar thoroughly, then 
add a little of the cream at a time, to keep from sep- 
arating ; add wine to the taste in the same manner 
(not quite a wineglass). Let the mixture melt. It 
will be a white froth when done. 

Birthday Pudding without Eggs. — One 
pound of suet shred fine, half a pint of molasses, 
one pound of currants, one pound of flour ; to be 
mixed with boiling milk ; add candied lemon, 
raisins, nutmeg, and bitter almonds to taste ; tie in 
a cloth, and boil five hours.

eggs (reserving the whites of three for the sauce), 
and one-half a cup of sugar. Bake about half an 
hoar. 



226 PUDDINGS AND PASTRY. 

Sauce for the Above. — Whites of three eggs 
beaten with one and a half cup of powdered sugar 
and a glass of wine. If persons are aVerse to using 
wine to flavor the sauce for puddings, they will 
find that any well-flavored jelly or preserve is a 
great addition to the sauce for plain puddings. 

Grandmamma's Pudding. — Cut some moder- 
ately thin slices of bread ; butter a mould and line 
it with the bread. Next, cover the bread with jam 
or marmalade. Fill up the mould with slices of 
bread, candied-peel, or marmalade, and raisins, or 
jam, whichever may be preferred. Beat two or 
three eggs, according to the size of the mould. 
Mix with a little sugar and sufficient milk to fill 
the mould. Cover with a cloth, and boil for an 
hour and a half. Serve with wine or sweet sauce. 

"West-Point Pudding. — One pound sheep's- 
tongue chopped fine, half pound suet chopped fine,

one pound of potatoes, boiled. Mix all well 
together and bake about four hours. 

Union Pudding. — Take one cup of white sugar, 
three tablespoonfuls of flour, two eggs, one grated 
nutmeg, and one good-sized cocoanut grated fine, 
two teacupfuls of new milk and a tablespoonful of 
good fresh butter. Bake like tarts, without an 
upper crust. 

Snow Pudding. — Half an ounce of gelatine, 
one pint of boiling water, three-quarters of a pound 



PUDDINGS AND PASTRY. 227 

of white sugar, the juice of two lemons. After it 
•s thoroughly dissolved, Ktraia it; as soon as it 
begins to thicken, add the well-beaten whites of 
two eggs; beat it for half an hour, and set it on ice, 
after putting in a mould or bowl. Make a rich, 
soft custard, flavored with the lemon-rinds grated. 
Send it to table in the middle of the custard. 

Persian Pudding. — Take the pulp of six baked 
apples ; add to them one ounce of rice previously 
boiled in milk, and beaten smooth, one ounce of 
sifted sugar, the grated rind of a lemon, and a 
teaspoonful of lemon-juice ; mix these well together ; 
then beat the whites of four eggs to a fine froth, 
put in the other ingredients, whisk it all up 
quickly, put it into a warm mould, and place it in 
a tolerably quick oven ; when properly set, turn it 
out and pour around it a custard made with the 
yelks of the eggs remaining from the pudding. 

VARIOUS KINDS OF PASTRY. 
In making pastry the cook should be particularly 
clean and neat. Her utensils should be kept in 
order, and when they are done with they should be 
carefully cleaned and put in their places Her 
paste-board and rolling-pin, let it be remembered, 
should, after using, be well scoured with hot water 
alone. She should not use soap or sand. A mar- 
ble slab is preferable to a board for rolling paste. 
Both are generally made too small to be convenient. 
Three feet long by two feet wide is a good size. In 



228 PUDDINGS AND PASTRY. 

making a paste a good cook will have no waste of 
any kind, and particularly she will not make more 
at one time than she wants, under the idea that she 
can keep it in flour till the next time of making; 
for it is ten to one but that the old paste will spoil 
the new. No flour except the very best can be used 
for fine descri])tions of pastry, and in damp weather 
it should be dried before the fire. Clarified drip- 
ping, good lard, marrow, salt butter, well washed, 
may be used for ordinary pastry; indeed, if they 
are pure and sweet they will form good pastry, 
with good flour and good management. In wealthy 
families, however, where economy is not an object, 
and everything for the table is required to be of the 
first quality, the safest plan is to use the best fresh 
butter. The fat that settles on stews, and on the 
broth in which meat has been boiled, may be used 
for pastry, that is, provided it is tasteless. Suet is 
sometimes used for meat pies, but though it makes 
a light crust, when hot, it does not eat well when 
cold. 

A great deal more butter, or fat of some kind or 
other, was formerly directed to be used in making 
I)astry than at present. For ordinary purposes, 
half the weight of lard or butter is sufficient, but in 
tlie richest crusts the quantity should never exceed 
the weight of flour. Eggs may be added to enrich 
the crust. Use no more water or other liquid in 
making paste than is absolutely necessary, or, in 
other words, take care not to " put out the miller's 



PUDDINGS AND PASTRY. 229 

eye," that is, to make the paste too moist. The 
great thing is to incorporate the flour well with the 
fat, which you cannot do if you allow too much 
water or milk in the first instance. 

The under or side crust, which should be thin, 
should not be made so rich as the top crust, as 
otherwise it will make the gravy or syrup greasy. 
All dishes in which pies are to be baked should be 
buttered or greased round the edges to prevent the 
crust from sticking, and if there be an under crust, 
all over the inside, and the same must be done with 
tins or saucers. 

There is a number of other little things to be at- 
tended to in making pastry, w'hich we will enumer- 
ate in as few words as we can. Fruit pies or large 
tarts should have a hole made in the middle of the 
crust. 

Flaky and Short Crusts. — In making a flaky 
crust a part of the fat should be worked with the 
hand to a cream, and then the whole of the flour 
well rubbed into it before any water or milk is 
added. The remaining fat must be stuck on the 
paste and be rolled out. For crisp crust, by far the 
most wholesome, the whole of the fat should be 
rubbed in and thoroughly incorporated with the 
flour. Water or milk must be added when this is 
done, and the dough, or rather paste, made up. 
The pie-board and rolling-pin should be well dusted 
with flour, and the dough should be well beaten 
with the pin to thoroughly mix it, and render it 



230 PUDDINGS AND PASTRY. 

light. Mind, in rolling out paste do not drive the 
pin backwards and forwards, but always keep foil- 
ing from you. In making flaky crusts the paste 
must be roiled out thin, and the fat or butter laid 
all over it ; then roll it up and beat it till it puffs 
up in little bladders ; it should be then finally rolled 
out and put in the oven as quickly as possible. 

Raised Crust. — Put two pounds and a half of 
flour on the paste-board, and put on the fire in a 
saucepan three-quarters of a pint of water and half 
a pound of good lard ; when the water bolls, make 
a hole in the middle of the flour, pour in the water 
and lard by degrees, gently mix it with a spoon, 
and when it is well mixed, then knead it with your 
hands till it becomes stiff; dredge a little flour to 
prevent it sticking to the board, or you cannot 
make it smooth ; then set it aside for an hour, and 
keep it cool ; do not roll it with your rolling-pin, 
but roll it with your hands, about the thickness of 
a quart pot ; cut it into six pieces, leaving a little 
for the covers ; put the left hand, clenched, in the 
middle of one of the pieces, and with the other ou 
the outside, work it up against the back of the left 
to a round or oval shape. It is now ready for the 
meat, whicn must be cut into small pieces with 
some fat, and pressed into the pie ; then cover it 
with the pa'fete previously rolled out to a proper 
thickness, and of the size of the pie ; put this lid on 
the pie and press it together with your thumb and 
finger, cut it all around with a pair of scissors, and 



PUDDINGS AND PASTRY. 231 

bake for an hour and a half. Our good old country 
housewives pride themselves very much upon being 
able to raise a large and high pork pie. This crust 
will answer for many meat and other pies baked in 
dishes or tins. 

Puff-Paste. — This paste is nearly the same as 
what we have called flaky crust, and of course made 
upon the same principles. If eggs are desired, 
allow three yelks to a pound of butter or lard. 
Rub a fourth part of the fat to a cream, then mix 
the eggs with it, and afterwards the flour. A very 
little water Avill suffice to wet it. Beat it with the 
pin to make it flaky ; roll it out thin three times, 
putting in a portion of the fat each time, and roll it 
from you ; after each rolling beat it well. 

Superior Puff-Paste. — One pound of flour, 
one pound of good butter, the yelk of an egg well 
beaten, and the juice of half a lemon. The paste 
must be made with cool hands, and in a cool place. 
Put the flour into a pan, make a hole in the middle, 
and put in the egg and lemon-juice, then cold 
water — enough, together, to make a tolerably stifl*, 
but not too stiff, paste. Roll it out, and put a 
layer of butter over it in patches, sprinkle some 
dry flour over this (not that of the pound first 
weighed ; that should all be wetted), fold over the 
paste, flour your paste-board and rolling-pin, and 
roll lightly on one side until butter and paste are 
amalgamated. In this manner continue to put on 



232 PUDDINGS AND PASTBY. 

the butter, and roll out the paste until all the butter 
is used. The paste should be put on to the dishes 
in about three layers, and should be put into a quick 
oven to bake. 

Sweet Paste. — This is suitable to fruit tarts 
generally, apples, perhaps, excepted, for which we 
recommend a puff paste. To three-quarters of a 
pound of butter put a pound and a luilf of flour, 
three or four ounces of sifted loaf sugar, the yelks 
of two eggs, and half a pint of new milk. Bake it 
in a moderate oven. 

Crust for Savory Pies. — To two pounds of 
flour, one and a half of butter or lard, and the yelks 
of three eggs ; rub part of the fat to a cream with 
the eggs, then rub in the flour; wet with cold water, 
and roll out with the remainder of the butter. This 
crust is suitable for pigeon, rabbit, hare, and other 
savory pies. 

Icing Pastry. — When nearly baked enough, 
take the pastry out of the oven and sift fine powdered 
sugar over it. Replace it in the oven, and hold 
over it till the sugar is melted a hot iron shovel. 
The above method is preferred for pastry to be 
eaten hot ; for cold, beat up the whites of two eggs 
well, wash over the tops of the pies with a brush, 
and sift over this a good coating of sugar ; cause 
it to adhere to the egg and pie-crust; trundle 
aver it a clean brush dipped in water till the 



PUDDINGS AND PASTRY. 233 

sugar is all moistened. Bake again for about ten 
minutes. 

French Crust for Raised Pies. — To every 
pound of flour allow half a saltspoonful of salt, two 
eggs, third of a pint of water, six ounces of butter. 
Spread the flour, which should be sifted and 
thoroughly dry, on the paste-board ; make a hole 
in the centre, into Avhich put the butter ; work it 
liglitly into the flour, and when quite fine, a!dd 
the salt ; work the whole into a smooth paste with 
the eggs (yelks and whites) and water, and make it 
very firm. Knead the paste well, and let it be 
rather stiff, that the sides of the pie may be easily 
raised, and that they do not afterwards tumble or 
shrink. 

Pie Crust. — For Meat Pies: Take one pound 
of dried flour and rub into it six ounces of lard, six 
ounces of butter, a small quantity of salt, and a 
half teaspoonful of baking powder. Mix all these 
ingredients well together, and then use as much 
water as will make them into a nice stiff paste. 
Roll it out, let it stand for about ten minutes and 
then roll it once more before putting it on the meat. 
The pie should be baked in a moderately quick 
oven. For Fruit Pies : Take one pound of dried 
flour, and one pound of butter, Avell squeezed in a 
clean cloth, to get the salt out. Break the butter 
with your fingers amongst the flour, as fine as 
possible, and then with a little cold water mix 



234 PUDDINGS AND PASTRY. 

into a tolerably stiiF paste. Gently roll it, passing 
the roller in one direction only — from you. After 
this, lightly fold it over, and set it aside for a 
quarter of an hour in a cool place ; then repeat the 
rolling in the same manner, and let it stand another 
quarter of an hour. This is to be repeated once 
more. Be sure to handle it as little as possible, 
and to keep it cool. Bake in a quick oven. 

Farmers' Pie. — Grate a good sweet pumpkin ; 
add to it sufficient milk to thin it like custard ; add 
four eggs, one teacupful of sugar, or sufficient to 
sweeten it to your taste ; add a little ground cinna- 
mon and a little cinnamon water ; mix all well to- 
gether ; make a crust like for pies, fill your shells, 
sprinkle them over thickly with pulverized cinna- 
mon. Bake with a moderate heat. 

Cracker Pies. — Six soda crackers p6unded and 
mashed in two cups of cold water for twenty min- 
utes, the rind and juice of two lemons, two and a 
half cups of white sugar ; mix well together ; bake 
in puff-paste ; this quantity will make three pies, 
and taste like green apples. 

Soda Cracker Pie. — Take four soda crackers, 
grated fine, three cupfuls of warm water, quarter of 
a teaspoonful of tartaric acid, the grated rind of an 
orange, three cupfuls of sugar, three tablespoonfuls 
of butter, a little salt ; make a good short crust, fill 
it with this mixture, and bake in a quick oven. 

Orange Pie. — Take the juice and pulp of six 



PUDDINGS AND PASTRY. 235 

large sour oranges, and the grated rind of four, a 
little salt, three cupfuls of sugar, three eggs, four 
cupfuls of water, six spoonfuls of rice flour ; mix 
these ingredients well together; make a good short 
crust, and bake like other pies. 

Aunt Harriet's Pie. — To make the crust, take 
eight tablespoonfuls of fine flour, and four large 
spoonfuls of butter, and a little salt. Rub it finely 
like for other pies, then wet it up with water suffi- 
cient to make a crust or dough, roll out, and cover 
your pie plates, fill them with the following mix- 
ture : Take six tablespoonfuls of rice flour, mix it 
into a paste, with cold water, then add six table- 
spoonfuls of white sugar, twelve spoonfuls of" warm 
water, and as much tartaric acid as will lay on a 
ten-cent-piece, and five drops of essence of lemon, 
make a thin top crust ; and bake like other pies. 

Washington Pie. — One cup of sugar, one egg, 
one-third of a cup of butter, half a cup of sweet 
milk, half a teaspoonful of soda, one teaspoonful of 
cream of tartar, one and a third cup of flour ; flavor 
with lemon. Grease two round tins, and put this 
cake in. It will bake in a short time. "When 
done, put on a dinner plate, and spread with nice, 
fine apple-sauce, then put the other cake on the top. 
This is very nice without sauce, still sauce im- 
proves it. • 

German Puffs. — One ounce of sweet almonds, 
blanched and pounded, with a dessertspoonful of 



236 PUDDINGS AND PASTRY. 

orange-flower water. Then add two tablcspoonfuls 
of flour, four eggs (but the whites of only two) 
beaten separately, one pint of cream, sweetened to 
taste with white sugar, and beat all very well. 
Bake this quantity in six large teacups, and serve 
very hot with butter and sugar sauce. 

Lemon Puffs, — Take a pound of finely-pow- 
dered loaf sugar, and mix it with the juice of two 
lemons, beat the white of an egg to a complete froth, 
then add it to the lemon and sugar, and beat the 
whole for half an hour, then well beat three more 
eggs, and grate the outside rind very fine from the 
peel of the two lemons you have used the juice of; 
add this and the eggs to the previous mixture, and 
well mix the whole. Sprinkle some finely-pow- 
dered sugar on a sheet of writing paper, and drop 
the mixture upon it. A moderate oven will bake 
them in a few minutes. 

Spiced Puffs. — Beat up any quantity of whites 
of eggs, adding white sifted sugar with any spices ; 
the puffs to be flavored with mace, cinnamon or 
cloves ; drop them from the point of a knife, in a 
little high towering form, upon damp wafer sheets, 
and put them into a very slow oven. 

Preserve Puffs. — Roll out puif-paste very 
thinly, cut it into round pieces, and lay jam on 
each; fold over flie paste, wet the edges with egg, 
and close them ; lay them on a baking sheet, ica 
them, and bake about a quarter of an hour. 



PUDDINGS. AND PASTRY. 237 

Apple Puff. — Prepare some apples in the same 
way as for sauce; while hot, beat them up with a 
small quantity of butter and a very little sugar; 
lemon-juice and sugar to taste. Take the whites 
of two eggs aud beat them up with two spoonfuls 
of wine, one of cream, one of pounded sugar, and 
one of lemon-juice; when beaten to a froth, put it 
on the apples. 

Egg Puffs. — Six eggs, one pint of milk, three 
spoonfuls of flour, four ounces of butter melted, and 
a spoonful of yeast ; mix, and fill cups half full ; 
bake fifteen minutes ; wine sauce. 

Lemon Custard Taet. — Squeeze the juice of 
two lemons upon half a pound of loaf sugar ; add 
the rind grated or pared as thin as possible. Boil 
the pulp of the lemons until tender in clear water. 
Beat and rub them through a sieve ; add them to 
the other ingredients ; pour in half a pint of white 
wine. Simmer all together for one hour ; gradu- 
ally mix in the beaten yelks of four eggs and 
whites of two. Strain into a tart dish edged with 
a rim of puff-paste, and bake for twenty minutes. 

Lemon Pie, No. 1. — The proportions are two 
lemons, four eggs, two tablespoonfuls of melted 
butter, ten tablespoonfuls of loaf sugar. Grate the 
yellow rind of the lemon, beat together the rind, 
juice, sugar, and the yelks of the eggs until very 
light. Prepare a large tart pie, fill the pie with 
the mixture before baking the paste, and bake until 



238 PUDDINGS AND PASTRY. 

the paste is done. Beat the whites stiff, and stir 
into them little by little one-fourth of a pound of 
sugar; spread it over the top, and bake a light 
brown. 

Lemon Pie, No. 2 {easily made). — Two lemons ; 
squeeze out the juice, and chop the lemons fine 
(take out the seeds) ; three cups of water, three 
cups of sugar, one egg, two-thirds of a cup of flour; 
beat the egg well with half a cup of water and the 
flour; then stir lemons, juice, and all together; 
this will fill three pies. 

Custard Cream Pie. — This is baked like a 
custard, but to be very nice, the edge of the plate 
should be layered with puff-paste ; make a custard 
of thin cream instead of milk, and bake it as a cus- 
tard. It must be eaten the same day it is baked. 

Cream Pie. — Take as much thick, sweet cream 
as will fill your pie-dish, to which add the whites 
of two fresh eggs beaten to a froth, and sugar 
enough to suit your taste. Flavor with lemon. 

Corn Starch Pie. — Boil six tablespoonfuls of 
corn starch in three pints of water ; let it cool, then 
add one cup of butter, one cup of sugar, one small 
cup of vinegar, and three eggs. Flavor with 
essence of lemon, and bake between two crusts. 

Frosted Pie. — Seven soda crackers soaked in 
cold water, three pints of milk, one whole egg and 
yelks of three, two or three lemons, peel grated, 
and juice ; sweeten to the taste before adding the

letnons. Beat the whites of tliree eggs with pow- 
dered sugar for the frosting, to be spread on and 
browned after the pies are baked. 

Macakoni Pie. — Boil the macaroni in water 
until quite tender; drain the water off, put into 
the baking-pan ; add a tablespoonful of butter, 
half a pound of grated cheese, a pint of milk, salt, 
pepper, and mustard to taste; if desired, the pan 
can be lined with a rich paste and an over crust. 

Superior Peach Pies. — Take good ripe peaches, 
halve and stone them; make a good short crust, 
and lay it in your pie-plates. Lay your peaches 
evenly to cover it ; then add to each moderate- 
sized pie about three spoonfuls of white sugar, and 
a few drops of essence of lemon, or rose, and half a 
teacupful of water; cover, and bake like other pies. 

Cranberry Tart. — Take half a [)iut of cran- 
berries, pick thetn from the stems and throw them 
into a saucepan with half a pound of white sugar 
and a spoonful of water ; let them come to a boil ; 
then retire them to stand on the hob while you peel 
and cut up four large apples; put a rim of light 
paste around your dish ; strew in the apples ; pour 
the cranberries ov^«r them ; cover with a lid of 
crust, and bake for an hour. For a pudding, pro- 
ceed in the same manner with the fruit, and boil it 
in a basin or cloth. 

Sand Tart. — One teacup of butter, one and a 
16 



240 PUDDINGS AND PASTKY. 

half of sugar, two well-beaten eggs, half a teaspoon^ 
ful of saleratus, three teaspoonfuls of water, flour 
to make thera stiff enough to roll out thin ; cut 
them out with a tumbler. Bathe the top with the 
white of an egg, and sprinkle on sugar. They will 
keep well for four or five months. 

Black Currant Tart. — Lightly stem and top 
the currants, being careful not to bruise them ; put 
them into a tart-dish with a rim of paste, and, as 
they are considered to be too rich by themselves, 
it is advisable to add a little white currant juice or 
cider to dilute their flavor; throw in a good deal 
of sugar, cover thera with a top crust, and bake 
rather more than an hour. 

Cherry and Currant Tart. — Stem and stone 
your cherries; take an equal weight of very ripe 
red currants, press them through a sieve, add the 
juice to your cherries with the crumb of two 
sponge-cakes, a quarter of a pound of sugar, and a 
wineglassful of brandy. Put it into a tart-dish 
lined with a rim of paste, cover it with a top crust, 
and bake it for an hour. 

Raspberry Cream Tart. — This is a delicious 
summer dish, and is prepared as follows : Roll out 
some thin puff-paste, and lay it in a patty-pan ; put 
in some raspberries, and strew over thera some very 
finely pounded sugar. Put on the coveting paste, 
and bake the tart. Cut it open, and put in half a 
pint of cream, the yelks of two or three eggs, well 



PUDDINGS AND PASTRY. 241 

beaten, and a little sugar. Let it stand till cold 
before it is sent to table. 

Orange Tart. — Grate the peel of one orange, 
and put the juice with it (keeping away the pips), 
also the juice and peel of half a lemon, a quarter 
of a pound of sugar, tM^o ounces of butter carefully 
melted, two eggs, leaving out one of the whites; 
beat them well together, and having lined a tart-tin 
with thin paste, fill it with the mixture, and bake 
it a quarter of an hour, or a little more, if requisite. 

Lemon Tart. — Mix well together the juice and 
grated rinds of two large lemons, half a pound of 
powdered loaf sugar, two eggs, and the crumb of 
two sponge-cakes ; beat it thoroughly smooth, and 
put it into twelve patty -pans, lined with a light 
puff-paste; bake them until the crust is done. 

Almond Tart. — Make a very fine paste with 
half a pound of blanched almonds beaten in a mor- 
tar, a quarter of a pound of powdered loaf sugar, a 
tablespoonful each of brandy and cream, a little 
nutmeg, the crumb of two stale sponge-cakes, and, 
if you can procure it, a little spinach-juice to color 
it green. When perfectly smooth, lay it either in 
patty-pans, or in a tart mould lined with a light 
paste ; bake for a quarter of an hour in a gentle 
oven, and before serving, decorate the top with

peel off the outer skin and out them into pieces of 
about three inches long ; pack them closely into a 
pie-dish lined with a rim of light paste ; add a good 
deal of sugar, put on a top crust, and bake it for 
an hour in a gentle oven. No water should be put 
to a rhubarb tart, for the vegetable is of so juicy a 
nature that most epicures evaporate it by keeping 
the stalks some days before using them. 

Greengage Tart. — Take some greengage 
plums, not over-ripe; do not stone them, but lay 
them either in a basin lined, or pie-dish edged, 
with a rich crust ; add a good quantity of white 
sugar, cover with a top crust, and boil or bake for 
an hour and a half.

of an ounce of mace, a little ground cloves and salt, 
one quart of brandy, one quart of Madeira wine. 

Mock Mince Pie. — Four Boston crackers, rolled, 
two-thirds of a teacup of cold water, one cup of 
molasses, half a cup of sugar, half a cup of vinegar, 
one egg, raisins, and spices, as for mince pies.

PUDDINGS AND PASTRY. 243 

sugar, two pounds of beef, the peel and juice of two 
lemons, a pint of sweet wine, a quarter of a pint of 
brandy, half an ounce of mixed spice. Press the 
whole into a deep pan well mixed. 

Another way. — Two pounds of raisins, three 
pounds of currants, three pounds of beef suet, two 
pounds of moist sugar, two ounces of citron, one 
ounce of orange-peel, one small nutmeg, one pottle 
of apples, chopped fine, the rind of two lemons and 
juice of one, half a pint of brandy; mix well to- 
gether. This should be made a little time before 
wanted for use. 

Pastry Sandwiches. — Puff-paste, jam of any 
kind, the white of an egg, sifted sugar. Roll the 
paste out thin, put half of it on a baking-sheet or 
tin, and spread equally over it any preserve that 
may be preferred. Lay over this preserve another 
thin paste, press the edges together all round, and 
mark the paste in lines with a knife on the surface, 
to show where to cut it when baked. Bake from 
twenty minutes to half an hour, and, a short time 
before being done, take the pastry out of the oven, 
brush it over with the white of an egg, sift over 
pounded sugar, and put it back in the oven to color. 
When cold, cut it into strips, pile these on a dish 
pyramidically, and serve. These strips, cut about 
two inches long, piled in circular rows, and a plate- 
ful of flavored whipped cream poured in the middle, 
make a very pretty dish. 



244 PUDDINGS AND PASTRY 

Florentines. — Roll puff-paste to the thickness 
of the eighth of an inch, and lay it on a thin bak- 
ing-tin. Spread over it a layer of greengage or any 
other preserve or jam, and bake it in a moderate 
oven. Take it out, and when partially cool, having 
whipped some whites of eggs with sugar, put the 
whip over the preserve, and strew some minced 
almonds all over the surface, finishing with sifted 
5ugar. Put it once more into the oven until the 
whip is quite stiff. The florentines should be of a 
pale color, and a few minutes after the paste is 
finally removed from the oven, it should be cut into 
diamonds and served up. 

Khubarb Pie, — Cut up in small pieces, skin- 
ning the older stalks ; add a little water and sugar 
before the crust is put on ; flavor with lemon. All 
juicy fruits can be maie in this way.

and serve when cold and well set. If the mould be 
dipped in warm water, the cream will turn out like 
a jelly. If no mould, put either in cups or a pie- 
dish. The rice had better be done a little too much 
than under.

stirring it till it is about the warmth of new milk, 
after which pour it through a fine colander into a 
dish containing three spoonfuls of lemon or orange 
juice, a little grated peel, and a little fruit marma- 
lade, chopped small, with two spoonfuls of white

hair sieve upon half a pound of pounded sugar; 
whip the whites of two eggs, add them to the apples, 
and beat all together till it becomes very stiff and 
looks quite white. Serve it heaped up on a dish. 

Italian Cream. — Take one pint of cream and 
half a pint of milk, make it hot, sweetening it to

split them in halves, line a glass dish with the 
pieces, mix together two wineglassfuls of Madeira 
wine or sherry, and one wineglassful of brandy.

berry jelly, which can readily be made by putting 
a pot of raspberry jam in the oven ; in a few min- 



248 CREAMS AND DESSERTS. 

iites it will be warm, wheu the liquid, which is the 
jelly, can be strained from it and poured over the 
pieces. Now put the other layer of pieces, soak this 
with wine, as before, but omit the raspberry; make 
a custard as directed for boiled custard. When cold, 
and just as the dish is going to table, pour the cold 
custard over, and sprinkle some ratafias on the top. 

Spanish Cream. — Half a pint of cream, same 
of new milk, three ounces of rice flour, a tablespoon- 
ful of peach or orange flower water ; sweeten it to 
taste. Boil till it is stifi\, stirring it constantly,

each egg add a tablespoonful of white sugar. Beat 
well together, and add to the milk while boiling. 
Boil a few minutes, take it oif, stir it until it cools, 
and flavor with lemon. Make in a tin vessel. 

Lemon Rice. — Wash some rice thoroughly in 
cold water, boil it in as much milk as it wiil absorb, 
sweeten it to taste and turn it into a mould. Peel 
a lemon, cut the peel into shreds three-quarters of 
an inch in length, and ])ut them into a little water. 
Boil up, and drain ; put them into a teacupful of 
fresh water. Squeeze the juice from a large lemon, 
piit it with some white sugar upon the shreds, and

CREAMS AND DESSERTS. 249 

be a thick syrup. Turn out the rice, and pour the 
syrup over it, spreading the shreds equally over the 
surface. 

Lemon Flummery. — Squeeze four lemons into 
a basin, throwing in the rinds, but not the seeds ; 
add half a pint of water, half a pound of loaf-sugar, 
and cover close for an hour ; take out the lemon- 
rinds, and again cover, and let it stand all night. 
Then strain through a cloth, and add one ounce 
of isinglass, and put it in a saucepan with six 
eggs well beaten ; set over the fire, and keep 
stirring one way till it is as thick as cream. When 
milk-warm, put into moulds previously dipped in 
cold water. 

Meringues. — The whites of six eggs and one 
pound of sifted pounded" white sugar. Procure a 
board about an inch in thickness, and of a conveni- 
ent size for the oven. Cover this with foolscap or 
thin cartridge paper, proceed to beat the whites of 
eggs to a substantial froth, remove the whisk and 
ptir the sugar in lightly with a spoon ; do not stir 
it too much, as it would lose its firmness. With a 
dessertspoon drop the mixture out on the papered 
board in masses about the size of an. egg, about an 
inch and a half apart ; in dropping them turn the 
spoon over as they fall, so as to produce as round 
an appearance as possible ; then dust them over 
with sifted sugar, and blow off the loose sugar from 
the paper. Put them in a moderately-heated oven, 



250 CREAMS AND DESSERTS. 

and bake a very light brown color. AVhen done, 
each piece must be carefully removed from the 
paper, the inside scraped out with a dessertspoon, 
leaving the shell about a quarter of an inch thick ; 
place them in order on a papered baking sheet, the 
hollow side upwards, and put again in the oven, 
taking care they do not acquire any more color; 
they should be dried so as to be quite crisp ; they 
may be put in the oven at night when the fire is out 
and the heat subsided, and remain until the morning, 
when they may be packed in a tin box and used 
when required. 

Trifle. — Arrange macaroons and sponge cakes 
in a deep glass dish ; place about them slices of 
currant jelly and little lumps of apricot jam, and 
pour as much white wine or brandy over them as 
they will drink. Take a quart of cream, flavor 
some sugar by rubbing it on a lemon until it takes 
the essence of the peel, and with it sweeten the 
cream to taste. Mill your cream to a strong froth ; 
lay as much froth on a sieve as will fill the dish 
intended for the trifle. Put the remainder of the 
cream into a tossing-pan, Avith a stick of cinnamon, 
the yelks of four eggs, well beaten, and sugar to 
taste, and stir it over a slow fire until it is thick ; 
pour it over the macaroons, and when it is cold put 
the frothed cream on the top, and decorate it with 
-sweetmeats of various colors. Another good trifle 
is made by placing the cakes, and saturating them 
as above, and then pouring over them a vet-y thick 



CREAMS AND DESSERTS. 251 

custard ; this is left some hours tc become firm, and 
is then covered with a layer of rich jam first and 
whipped cream. 

Sweet Souffle. — Thicken to a stiff paste over 
the stove, one pint of milk, with sifted flour ; stir 
while heating; add the well beaten yelks of six 
eggs, a pinch of salt, and sugar to sweeten. Beat 
the whites of eight eggs to a froth ; stir into the 
mixture. Bake in a quick oven fifteen minutes. 
Glaze with finely powdered sugar, and send to the 
table quickly as it will soon fall. Ground rice 
may be used instead of flour, and lemon-juice or 
grated lemon-peel used for flavoring. 

Sweet Dish of Macaroni. — Quarter of a 
pound of macaroni, a pint and a half of milk, the 
rind of half a lemon, three ounces of lump sugar, 
three-quarters of a pint of custard. Put the milk 
into a saucepan, with the lemon-peel and sugar, 
bring it to the boiling point ; drop in the macaroni, 
and let it gradually swell over a gentle fire, but do 
not allow the pipes to break ; the form should be 
entirely preserved, and though tender should be 
firm and not soft, with no part beginning to melt. 
Should the milk dry away before the macaroni 
is swelled, add a little more. Place the macaroni 
on a dish, pour the custard over the hot macaroni, 
grate over it a little nutmeg, and when cold, garnish 
the dish with slices of candied citron-peel. 

Lemon Honeycomb. — This is a very simple 



252 CEEAMS AND DESSERTS. 

dish, and one that makes a pleasant variety on the 
supper-table. The juice of a lemon should l)e 
sweetened to the taste, and put into the dish in 
which it will be served up. The white of an egg 
is beaten into a pint of rich cream, with a little 
sugar, and whisked. As the froth rises, it should 
be placed on the lemon-juice, and has a very light 
and pretty appearance. It is desirable to prepare 
this dish the day before it is required, and a few 
pieces of sponge cake may be strewed over it just 
before it is sent up. 

BiBAVOE. — One pint of cream whipped until 
stiff, one ounce of isinglass boiled and strained in 
about one pint of water until reduced to a half pint. 
Four ounces of sugar, ong' vanilla beau ; stir in the 
cream when the isinglass gets blood heat. Then 
mould and. cut with whipped cream. 

Delicate Dessert. — Lay half a dozen crackers 
in a tureen, pour on enough boiling water to cover 
them. In a few moments they will be swollen to 
three or four times their original size. Now grate 
loaf sugar and a little nutmeg over them, and dip 
on enough sweet cream to make a nice sauce, and 
you will have a simple and delicious dessert that 
will rest lightly on the stomach — aud it is easily 
prepared. Leave out the cream, and it is a valuable 
receipt for "sick-room cookery." 

German Flottkrexgel. — Take one pound of 
dry flour, three-quarters of a pound of well- washed 



CREAMS AND DESSERTS. 253 

butter, ten tablespooiifuls of cream. For the top 
of these cakes melted butter or egg, powdered sugar 
and cinnamon. Break the butter into small pieces, 
and mix with the flour, then adding the cream ; 
mix quickly into a light paste. From this break 
pieces, and roll them out with the hand about a 
quarter of a yard long, and join the two ends in the 
middle, to give them the form of a B. When all 
are done, grease them on top with egg or melted 
butter, strewing sugar and cinnamon over it. Those 
who like almonds wnll find them with the above 
very delicious. These cakes require to be baked 
quickly.

dress it with sweetmeats. Just before it is to be 
served, pour cream enough in the dish to float it. 

Floatinq Island. — Take six eggs, separate 
them ; beat the yelks, and stir into a quart of milk ; 
sweeten to taste; flavor with lemon or nutmeg. Put

done, put into a deep dish, and heap the frothed 
eggs upon it. Serve cold. 

French Island. — Take a pint of rich cream 
and dissolve in it two tablespoonfuls of currant or 
plum jelly ; to this add a large wineglassful of 
white wine, and then sweeten the whole to taste. 
Take a half pint of rich cream, sweeten and flavor 
it, and beat it to a stiff froth. Place the first mix- 
ture in a glass bowl, and the whipped cream to float 
on top. This is a very nice and delicate dessert. 

Floats. — Break the whites of six eggs into a 
flat dish, beating as for icing; add a tablespoonful 
of pounded loaf-sugar for each egg. When quite 
stiff beat into it a tablespoonful (or more, according

will continue sound for some months. If the 
weather is fine, three days will be enough to dry 
them.

simply one dessertspoonful of very finely powdered 
and sifted mixed spice, mixed with three dessert- 
spoonfuls of powdered sugar. 

Snowballs. — Take half a pound of the best rice,

rind of an orange, beat it fine in a mortar, put to it 
a spoonful of brandy, the juice of an orange, four 
ounces of loaf sugar, and the yelks of four eggs. 
Beat all well together for ten minutes, pour in a

and two eggs, well beaten. Simmer it until it is 
of the proper thickness, stirring it in the whole time. 
Pour into cups or a custiird-dish. 

Milk Pancakes. — Put four yelks and two whites 
of eggs into a pint of milk, and dredge in flour until

leave them whole, but take out the cores. Put a 
little water in the preserving pan and let the apples 
cook, with a large lump of sugar, taking great care 
that they do not break. Place the apples in a glass 
dish, and when they are cold fill the centre of each 
with apricot jam, or any other recherche preserve. 
Boil the liquid until it jellies, pour it into a dish, 
that it may take its form, let it cool, and then put 
it over the apples without breaking it. The French 
receipt adds that the jelly will leave the dish easily 
if it be dipped for an instant into hot water, but as 
this would be likely to dull the jelly, it is a better 
plan to just dip, shape, jelly, and all into cold water, 
a plan followed by good confectioners.

Snitz and Knep. — Take of sweet dried apples 
(dried with the skins on, if you can get them) about 
one quart. Put them in the bottom of a porcelain 
or tin-lined boiler with a cover. Take a nice piece 
of smoked ham washed very clean, and lay on top ; 
add enough w^ater to cook them nicely. About 
twenty minutes before dishing up, add the following 
dumplings. — Dumplings — Mix a cup of warm milk 
with one egg, a little salt, and a little yeast, and 
enough flour to make a sponge. When light, work 
into a loaf. Let stand until about twenty minutes 
before dinner, then cut off slices or lumps, and lay 
on the apples, and let steam through. 



262 CREAMS AND DESSERTS. 

Stewed Pears. — Take six large and ripe pears, 
peel, core and cut them lengthways. Put thera 
into a very clean stewpan, cover them with the 
sugar. Peel the lemon very finely, cut the rind 
into long strips, and squeeze the juice of the lemon 
on the sugar. Gently shake the pan until the sugar 
is dissolved, place the stewpan on a very slow fire 
for fifteen minutes, shake it again once or twice, and 
turn each piece with a fork. Let it stew slowly 
again for ten minutes. Place on a dish to cool. 
Dress them on a flat china or glass dish, pour the 
syrup over, and serve. 

Chocolate Caramel. — Half a pound of choco- 
late, three pounds of dark brown sugar, one-eighth 
of a pound of butter, a small teacup of milk ; season 
with vanilla, or grated lemon or orange-peel. Boil 
it very quickly over a hot fire, stirring constantly. 
When it becomes hard on being dropped in Water, 
take it oif the fire and stir for a few moments before 
po'uring into buttered dishes. Before it is quite cool 
cut into little squares. Those who like the craramel 
very hard need not stir it, as this makes it "sugary." 
The grated peel should not be put in till the caramel 
is taken from the fire. 

Caramels. — Two cups of brown sugar, one cup 
of molasses, a piece of butter the size of an egg ; 
three tablespoonfuls of flour. Boil these together 
for twenty-five minutes. Then add half a pound 
of grated chocolate dissolved in one cup of sweet 



CREAMS AND DESSERTS. 263 

milk. Let it boil until it will harden when dropped 
into water (stirring constantly) ; take it from the 
fire and add one teaspoonful of vanilla; pour it in 
buttered plates to cool ; just before it is hard mark 
it into small squares. 

Burnt Sugar. — Take one and a half tablespoon- 
fuls of white sugar and put it in a ladle over the 
fire, and stir with a wooden spoon. When the 
sugar is black, add of water one gill and a half; let 
it cool, strain, and keep it in a bottle. It is used 
for coloring soup, gravy, and other dishes, and can 
be put in ice cream to color it. 

Friar's Omelette. — Boil a dozen apples as for 
sauce, stir in a quarter of a pound of butter, and 
the same of white sugar ; when cold, add four well- 
beaten eggs; put it into a baking-dish strewn thickly 
with crumbs of bread, so as to stick to the bottom 
and sides ; strew crumbs of bread plentifully over 
the apple mixture when in the baking-dish ; bake, 
turn out, and grate sugar over it. 

Angel's Food. A New Dish. — Make a rich 
custard, pour it in a glass bowl, and put a layer of 
sliced cake on it. Stir some finely-powdered sugar 
into quince or apple jelly, and drop it on the cake. 
Pour syllabub on the cake, and then put on another 
layer of cake, and icing. 

Chocolate Butter. — Stir quarter of a pound 
of Initter over the fire until quite soft and creamy ; 
put two cakes of good vanilla-flavored chocolate 



264 CREAMS AND DESSERTS. 

on a till plate, and add cream until they are soft 
enough to mix with the butter. Stir all well to- 
gether. Serve cold, to use like butter with bread 
or biscuit. 

Chocolate Charlotte Husse. — Having 
soaked in cold water an ounce of isinglass, or of 
gelatine, shave down three ounces of the best choco- 
late, which must have no spice or sugar in it, and 
mix it gradually into a pint of cream, adding the 
soaked isinglass. Set the cream, chocolate, and 
isinglass over the fire, in a porcelain kettle, and 
boil it slowly till the isinglass is dissolved thor- 
oughly, and the whole is well mixed. Then take 
it olf the fire and let it cool. Have ready eight 
yelks of eggs and four whites, beaten all together 
till very light ; and stir them gradually into the 
mixture, in turn with half a pound of powdered 
loaf sugar. Simmer the whole over the fire, but do 
not let it quite boil. Then take it off, and whip it 
to a strong froth. Line your moulds with sponge 
cake, and set them on ice. If you like a strong 
chocolate flavor, take four ounces of the cocoa. 

Charlotte Russe. — Take an ounce of isinglass 
or of gelatine, and soften it by soaking it awhile in 
cold water. Then boil it slowly in a })int of cream, 
sweetened with a quarter of a pound of fine loaf 
sugar (adding a handful of fresh rose-leaves, if con- 
venient, tied in a thin muslin bag), till it is 
thoroughly dissolved, and well mixed. Take it off 



CREAMS AND DESSERTS. 265 

the fire; set it to cool; and beat together till very 
light and thick, four whole eggs, and the yelks only 
of four others. Stir the beaten eggs gradually into 
the mixture of cream, sugar, and isinglass, and set 
it again over the fipe. Stir it well, and see that it 
only simmers ; taking it off before it comes quite 
to a boil. Then, while it is warm, stir in sufficient 
extract of roses to give it a. high rose-flavor and a 
fragrant smell. Have ready two moulds lined with 
lady cake, or almond sponge cake. Fill them with 
the mixture, and set them on ice. Before they go to 
table, ice the tops of the charlotte, flavoring the 
icing with rose. 

Charlotte de Russe. — Take a little less than 
one ounce of gelatine, and dissolve in one pint of 
new milk. Strain into one pint of thick cream made 
.very sweet, and set this in a cool place or on the 
ice. Take the whites of seven eggs, and beat to a 
froth ; then add them to the cream, and beat light. 
Flavor with vanilla, and keep on the ice until 
wanted. Line the moulds with very light sponge 
cake, and fill with the above when wanted. 

Jam- or Marmalade Charlotte {without 
Eggs). — Cut five slices of bread a quarter of an inch 
thick, trim oft' the crust, lay them in a dish, and 
pour over six ounces of dissolved fresh butter. Put 
it in the oven for ten minutes, and, when the bread 
is cold and the butter all absorbed, spread each 
piece of bread a quarter of an inch thick with any 



266 CREAMS AND DESSERTS. 

kind of jam or marmalade, and over that put a tea- 
spoonful of powdered loaf sugar. Blanch and chop 
two ounces of sweet almonds, butter a plain mould, 
strew the almonds over, lay in the slices of bread 
and jam ; place a dish over the mould, and bake in 
a quick oven. 

Buttered Orange Juice, a cold dish. — ISIix 
the juice of seven Seville oranges with four spoon- 
fuls of rose-water, and add the whole to the yelks 
of eight and whites of four eggs, well" beaten; then 
strain the liquors to half a pound of sugar pounded, 
stir it over a gentle fire, and when it begins to thicken 
put about the size of a small walnut of butter; 
keep it over the fire a few minutes longer, then pour 
it into a flat dish, and serve to eat cold. It may be 
done in a china basin in a saucepan of boiling water, 
the top of which will just receive the basin. 

Cakes for Dessert. — Four eggs, half a pound 
of butter, half a pound of sugar, half a pound of 
flour. Mix the butter, sugar, and yelks of the 
eggs thoroughly, then add the flour and mix again, 
then the whites of the eggs beaten to a thick froth. 
Grate in a little lemon rind. Put in little .dishes, 
filling each about one-third full, and bake till done. 

Apple Charlotte. — Take any number of ap- 
ples you may desire to use ; peel them, cut them 
into quarters, and take out the core. Cut the quar- 
ters into slices, and let them cook over a brisk fire, 
with butter, sugar, and powdered cinnamon, until 



CREAMS AND DESSERTS. 



26^ 



they are en marmalade. Cut thin slices of crumb of 
bread, dip them in butter, and with them line the 
sides and bottom of a tin shape. Fill the middle 
of the shape with alternate layers of the apple and 
any preserve you may choose, and cover it with 
more thin slices of bread. Then place the shape in 
an oven, or before the fire, until the outside is a fine 
brown, and turn it out upon a dish, and serve it 
either hot or cold. For croquettes de pomme^s you 
cook the apple just as for the Charlotte; but instead 
of putting it into the jelly shape you roll into balls, 
or rather cakes, which you cover with egg and 
bread crumbs, and fry of a rich brown. 

PoMMES AU E,iz. — Peel a number of apples of a 
good sort, take out the cores, and let them simmer 
in a syrup of clarified sugar, with a little lemon-peel. 
Wash and pick some rice, and cook it in milk, 
moistening it therewith by little and little, so that 
the grains may remain whole. Sweeten it to taste, 
and add a little salt and a taste of lemon-peel. 
Spread the rice upon a dish, mixing some apple pre- 
serve with it, and place the apples upon it, and fill 
up the vacancies between the apples with some of 
the rice. Place the dish in the oven until the sur- 
face gets brown, and garnish with spoonfuls of 
bright-colored preserve or jelly. 

Delicious Dish of Apples. — Take two pounds 
of apples, pare and core them, slice them into a pan; 
add one pound of loaf sugar, the juice of three 



268 



CREAMS Ayi) DESSERTS. 



lemons, and the grated lind of one. Let these boil 
about two hours. Turn it into a mould, and serve 
it with thick custard or cream. 

Gateau de Pommes. — Take a few apples, boil 
them with as little water as possible, and make them 
into apple sauce, then add a pound and a half of 
sugar, and the juice of a lemon ; boil all together till 
quite firm, and put it into a mould. Garnish it 
with almonds stuck over it. It will keep for many 
months if allowed to remain in the mould. 

Apple Souffle. — Stew the appks with a little 
lemon-peel ; sweeten them, then lay them pretty 
high round the inside of a dish. Make a custard 
of the yelks of two eggs, a little cinnamon, sugar, 
and milk. Let it tliicken over a slow fire, but not 
boil ; when ready, pour it in the inside of the apple. 
Beat the whites of the eggs to a strong froth, and 
cover the whole. Throw over it a good deal of 
pounded sugar, and bi'own it of a fine brown. 

Apple in Jelly. — Peel and quarter some good 
apples, and take out the core. Cook them with just 
water enough to cover them, some slices of lemon, 
and clarified sugar, until they are soft. Take out 
the pieces of apple with great care not to break the 
pieces, and arrange them in the jars. Then boil the 
syrup until it will jelly, and pour it over the pieces 
of apple. 

Apple Float. — Take six large apples, pare, 
slice, and stew them in as much water as will cover 



•CEEAMS AND DESSERTS. 269 

them. When well done, press them through a sieve, 
and make very sweet with crushed or loaf sugar. 
While cooling, beat the whites of four eggs to a 
stiff froth, and stir in the apples ; flavor with lemon 
or vanilla. Serve with sweet cream. Quite as 
good as peaches and cream. 

Apple Snow. — Put twelve good tart apples in 
cold water, and set them on a slow fire ; when soft, 
drain off the water, strip the skins from the apples, 
core and lay them in a large glass dish. Beat the 
whites of twelve eggs to a stiif froth, put half a 
pound of powdered white sugar to the apples ; beat 
them, and add the eggs. Beat the whole to a stiff 
snow, and turn into a dessert-dish. 

Floating Island op Apples. — Bake or scald 
eight or nine large applies ; when cold, pare them 
and pulp them through a sieve. Beat up this pulp 
with sugar, and add to it the whites of four or five 
eggs previously beaten up with a small quantity of 
rose-water. Mix this into the pulp a little at a 
time, and beat it until quite light. Heap it up on 
a dish, with a rich custard or jelly round it. 

Apple Island. — Make some good apple sauce, 
which has been flavored with lemon and clove, beat 
it up very fine, with loaf sugar enough to taste sweet; 
add two glasses of sherry, then beat the whites of 
four eggs separately till they are of a light froth, 
strain them into a large basin, beat them up again; 
now add two tablespoonfuls of cream, or a little 



270 CREAMS AND DESSERTS. • 

milk, and a quarter of an ounce of isinglass, dis- 
solved in a little water, and added to the milk and 
egg froth. Beat it well up, take off the froth with 
a spoon, and lay it on an inverted sieve over a dish. 
When sufficient froth is made, beat the remainder 
up with the apples till the whole is very light and 
frothy. Place the apples piled high in a glass dish, 
pour some cold custard around, not on it, then take 
off the froth and put on the top 6f the apples. 

Apple Cheese Cakes. — Haifa pound of apple 
pulp, quarter of a pound of sifted sugar, quarter of 
a pound of butter, four eggs, the rind and juice of 
one lemon. Pare, core, and boil sufficient ap])les to 
make half a pound when cooked ; add to these the 
sugar, the butter, which should be melted, the eggs, 
leaving out two of the whites, and the grated rind 
and juice of one lemon ; stir the mixture well. 
Line some patty-pans with puff-pastfe, put in the 
mixture, and bake about twenty minutes. 

Apple Pique. — Peel and stew some apples, but 
do not let them break. Place them in a glass dish 
half full of syrup, and put a piece of currant jelly 
on the top of each apple. 

Sponge Cake for Dessert. — One pound of 
sugar, ten eggs, half the weight of the sugar and 
eggs in flour. Beat the yelks of the eggs, flour, and 
sugar together, then add the whites, beaten to a froth, 
when just ready for the oven. Butter square tins, 
put in the mixture one inch deep. This will make 



CREAMS AND DESSERTS. 271 

two cakes. Take one of them, blanche almonds, 
and stick the small ends of them in the cake, just 
eo far that they will stand up, putting them in about 
an inch apart. Then make a custard of three eggs 
to a pint of milk ; sweeten to taste. Pour the cus- 
tard over the cake just before serving. 

A Dish of Snow. — Pare and core a dozen of 
large apples, put them into cold water and stew them 
till soft, then pulp through a sieve, and sweeten it 
to the taste with loaf-sugar. Lay it on the dish on 
which it is to be sent to table, then beat the whites 
of twelve eggs to a strong froth, with half a pound 
of sifted white sugar, and a flavoring of vanilla or 
orange flower. Strew this over the apple pulp very 
high, and it will present all the appearance of a 
veritable dish of snow. 

Sugar Drops. — Beat the whites and yelks of 
four eggs separately to a light foam, dilute the yelks 
with two teaspoonfuls of water, and turn them with 
the whites, and beat them some time ; then add by 
degrees a pound of sugar in fine powder, and then 
four ounces of superfine flour, beating the mixture 
constantly. Drop the mixture on white paper, 
placed in a tin plate, in any shape you please, ice 
them over with sugar in powder, to prevent run- 
ning, and bake about ten minutes in a moderate 
oven. 

Ice Cream. — To two quarts of cream add one 
pound of white sugar, boil one tablespoonful of 
18

arrowroot in a tumbler of milk, mix all together 
and freeze. It will be found advisable to stir the 
mixture frequently. To give the vanilla flavor, put 
in with the boiled arrowroot half a vanilla bean, 
previously grated. For strawberry and other fruit 
creams, add a little larger proportion of sugar, and 
freeze as soon as possible to prevent curdling. 

Lemon Ice Cream. — To one quart of cream 
eight ounces sngar, one lemon. Grate the lemon- 
rind in the sugar, add the raw cream. Strain and 
freeze very soon. 

Water Ices. — Made with any desired fruit, such 
as lemon, currant, strawberry, raspberry, etc.; the 
same to be squeezed, sweetened to taste, and added 
to water. Strain thoroughly before freezing, and 
only use the pure liquid so obtained. Orange water 
ice should be nearly the pure juice of the orange. 



CHAPTER VIII. 

PRESERVES AND JELLIES. 
DIRECTIOXS FOR PRESERVING FRUITS, ETC. 

Preserves of all kinds should be kept entirely 
secluded from the air and in a dry place. In rang- 
ing them on the shelves of a store-closet, they 
should not be suffered to come in contact with the 
wall. Moisture in winter and spring exudes from 
some of the driest walls, and preserves invariably 
imbibe it, both in dampness and taste. It is neces- 
sary occasionally to look at them, and if they have 
been attacked by mould, boil them up gently again. 
To prevent all risks, it is always as well to lay a 
brandy paper over the fruit before tying down. 
This may be renewed in the spring. 

Fruit jellies are made in the ratio of a quart of 
fruit to two pounds of sugar. They must not be 
boiled quick nor very long. Practice and a gene- 
ral discretion^ill be found the best guides to regu- 
late the exact time, which necessarily must be af- 
fected, more or less by local causes. 

To Preserve Peaches. — The clear-stone, yel- 
low peaches, white at the stone, are the best. Weigh 
the fruit after it is pared. To each pound of fruit 

273 



274 PRESERVES AND JEIXIES. 

allow a pound of loaf sugar. Put a layer of sugar 
at the bottom of the preserving-kettle, and then a 
layer of fruit, and so on until tlie fruit is all in. 
Stand it over the fire until the sugar is entirely dis- 
solved ; then boil them until they are clear ; take 
them out piece by piece, and spread them on a dish 
free from syrup. Boil the syrup in the pan until 
it jellies ; when the peaches are cold, fill the jars 
half full with them, and fill up with boiling syrup. 
Let them stand a short time covered with a thin 
cloth, then put on brandy paper, and cover them 
close with corks, skin, or paper. From twenty to 
thirty minutes will generally be sufficient to preserve 
them. 

Peach Marmalade. — Prepare peaches as for 
jam, boil one hour ; mix equal parts of sugar with 
the jam; when dissolved, pass fhe whole through a 
sieve ; boil slowly two hours, being very careful not 
to burn ; spread it on plates and set it in a cool 
oven, where it will dry but not burn, for a half day, 
when it will be ready to pack into moulds ; cover 
the moulds with paper dipped into the white of 
eggs, beaten as stiff as possible; it must be entirely 
free from juice, of a dark mahogany color, and 
clear when finished, sufficiently stiff to cut with a 
knife; keep it cool; it is liable to mouhl, which 
can be the more readily removed if a piece of paper, 
closely fitting the edges of the jar, is jiressed firmly 
on the marmalade before covering with the egg 
paper. No air should be allowed to remain iu the 



PRESERVES AND JELLIES. 275 

fruit, which should be packed very closely; and, aa 
marmalade is very thick, it will require some care 
to accomplish it. 

Peach Jam* — This confection should be made 
of the cling-stone peach in pre^rence, it being more 
juicy and of a higher flavor than the other kind 
of peach, the stone of which separates from the 
pulp. Treat the peaches exactly in the manner 
directed for apricots, using the same quantity of 
sugar. 

Raspberry Fool. — Put your fruit for a quarter 
of an hour into an oven ; Avhen tender, pulp it 
through a sieve, sugar it, add the crumb of suffi- 
cient sponge-cake to thicken it ; put it into a glass 
mould, or into custard-cups, and lay some thick 
cream on the top. If for immediate use, the cream 
may be beaten up with the fruit. 

Raspberry Jam. — Let the raspberries be thor- 
oughly ripe. Mash them with a wooden spoon. To 
every pound of raspberries add a pound of sifted 
sugar. Boil this well together during half an hour, 
stirring it continually, lest it should burn. When 
of a good thickness, put it into pots, let it cool 
thoroughly, and cover with brand ied paper. 

Celery Preserve. — Cut the" blanched part of 
the celery in pieces, and boil it in water with a large 
quantity of ginger until it is quite tender, then 
throw it into cold water and allow it to remain for 
an hour. Put it over a slow fire in good syrup, 



276 PRESEEVES AND JELLIES. 

with some pieces of ginger, and let it remain sim- 
mering for an hour. Cool it again, and in the 
meantime thicken the syrup by further evaporation. 
Put the celery in again, and repeat the same pro- 
cess. After a third simmering in this way, taking 
care to keep the syrup thick, put the celery into 
pots, and cover with a syrup. 

Peeseeved Lettuce Stalks. — Peel large let- 
tuce stalks that have run to seed, cut them in pieces, 
boil them gently till tender, but not too soft, put- 
ting half a dozen whole red peppers in the water ; 
put tliem to drain ; make a syrup and boil the 
stalks up in it just once a day for a week ; then 
make a good rich syrup, well skimmed and boiled, 
scraping in some best wliite ginger ; pour hot over 
the stalks ; keep in a covered jar. 

To Preserve Watermelon Rinds. — Do not 
cut your rinds too thin ; pare oif the outside green 
rind ; soak them two days in clean soft water, and 
then drain them. Take six pounds of sugar and 
three pints of water, boil to a thick syrup ; then 
add your watermelon rinds; boil until they are 
clear; flavor with orange flower water; cool, and 
put away in jars for use. 

Preserved Citron. — :Take some fine citron 
melons, pare, core, and cut them into slices, then 
weigh them, and to every pound of fruit allow three- 
quarters of a pound of the best refined sugar. Make 
a syrup, skim it clear, then put in the citron and 



PRESEEVES AND JELLIES. 277 

ginger, and boil until the citron is quite tender and 
clear. Allow a quarter of a pound of green ginger 
to two good sized melons. When the citron is done, 
put it in the jars, boil the syrup a few minutes 
longer, skim it till perfectly clear, and pour it over 
the fruit. Fine fresh lemons can be used instead 
of the ginger, if preferred. Four large ones will be 
sujfficient for two melons. Slice and boil them with 
the fruit the same as the ginger. Lay upon the top 
of the syrup a double whiie tissue-paper, cut exactly 
to fit the surface, and paste paper over the, top of 
each jar. .iB(-^ni; 

Apricot Jam. — Let the fruit be just in maturity, 
but not over ripe. Remove the skins, then cut the 
apricots in halves. Crack the stones, take out the 
kernels, bleach them in boiling water, and then 
pound them in a mortar. Boil the broken stones, 
skins, and parings in double the qimntity of water 
required for the jam. Reduce it in the boiling to 
one-half of its original quantity, then strain it 
through a jelly-bag. To each pound of prepared 
apricots put a quarter of a pint of this juice, a pound 
of sifted loaf sugar, and the pounded kernels. Put 
it on the fire, which should be brisk, and stir the 
whole with a wooden spoon until it is of a nice con- 
sistence, but without being very stiff, or it would 
have a bad flavor. Put it immediately into pots, 
and let these stand uncovered during twenty-four 
hours, then strew a little sifted sugar over the upper 



278 PRESERVES AND JELLIES. 

surface of the jam in each pot, and tie egged paper 
over each pot. 

To Preserve Hedge Pears. — Take four pounds 
of sugar and two pounds of water, boil to a mid- 
dling thick syrup. Pare six pounds of good ripe 
hedge pears, and leave them whole. Boil these in 
your syrup until done ; cool, flavor with orange 
flower water, and put away in jars for use. 

Pears for the Tea Table. — Take ripe pears 
and wipe them carefully, place a layer, stem upward, 
in a stone jar, sprinkle over sugar, then set in another 
layer of pears, and so on till the jar is filled. To 
every gallon put in one and a half pints of water. 
Cover the top of tlie jar with pie crust, and set it in 
a slow oven for two hours. 

Preserving Pears. — Gather the fruit when not 
too ripe, peel, then cut them into halves or quarters, 
weigh them, and to every pound of fruit allow one 
pound of the best white sugar. Put the fruit in a 
stone jar with a layer of fruit and one of sugar until 
you get all the fruit covered. Let them remain in 
the jar one night, then take your fruit out and lay 
them on dishes. Put the sugar into a brass or bell 
metal kettle and make a thick syrup, then put your 
pears into the syrup, and let them boil until they 
look clear, and they are ready for use. 

Blackberry Jelly. — Gather the fruit when 
perfectly ripe, and in very dry weather. Put the 
blackberries into a jar and place the jar in hot water, 



PRESERVES AND JELLIES. 279 

keeping it boiling until the juice is extracted from 
the fruit. Pass it through a fine sieve or jelly-bag 
without much pressure. For every pint of juice 
add fourteen ounces of sugar, and boil in a clean 
preserving-pan about five and twenty minutes, care- 
fully taking ofi" the scum as it rises to the surface. 
Place it hot in small jars and cover it down with 
thin tissue-paper, dipped in brandy, and brown paper 
over it. Keep it in a cool, dry place. 

Blackberries. — Preserve these as strawberries 
or currants, either liquid, or jam, or jelly. Black- 
berry jelly or jam is an excellent medicine in sum- 
mer complaints or dysentery. To make it, crush a 
quart of fully ripe blackberries with a pound of the 
best loaf sugar, put it over a gentle fire, and cook it 
until thick, then put to it a gill of the best fourth- 
proof brandy. Stir it awhile over the fire, then put 
it in pots. 

Greengage Jam. — To every pound of fruit, 
weighed before being stoned, allow three-quarters 
of a pound of lump sugar. Divide the greengages, 
take out the stones, and put them in a preserving- 
pan. Bring the fruit to a boil, then add the sugar, 
and keep stirring it over a gentle fire until it is 
melted. Remove the scum as it rises, and just be- 
fore the jam is done, boil it rapidly for five minutes. 
To ascertain when it is sufficiently boiled, pour a 
little on a plate, and if the syrup thickens and ap- 
pears firm it is dojie. Have ready all the kernels 
blanched, put them into the jam, give them one 



280 PRESERVES AND JELI.IES. 

boil, and pour the preserve into pots. When cold, 
cover down with oiled papers, and over these tissue- 
paper, brushed over on both sides witli the white 
of an egg. 

Greengages. — Weigh a pound of sugar to a 
pound of fruit, the largest, when they begin to get 
soft, are the best. Split them and take out the ker- 
nels and stew them in part of the sugar. Take out 
the kernels from the shells and blanch them. The 
next day strain off the syrup and boil it with the 
remaining sugar about ten minutes. Skim it and 
add the fruit and kernels ; skim it until clear, then 
put into small pots with syrup and kernels. 

Bottled Green Gooseberries. — Cut ofP the 
tops and stalks of some gooseberries which have not 
attained their full growth, and put them into wide- 
necked bottles which have been well washed and 
dried. Cork them loosely, and set them in a pan 
of cold water, which should be brought to boil very 
gradually. Leave the gooseberries to simmer until 
they assume a shrunken appearance, when take the 
bottles out. If they are not full, take the contents 
of one bottle to fill up the rest, and pour sufficient 
boiling water into each bottle as will cover the 
gooseberries. Cork the bottle close, and tie a blad- 
der over the tops, keeping them in a dry, cool place 
until wanted. When required for tarts or puddings, 
pour the water away, and add as much sugar as 
would be necessary for fresh fruit, which they closely 
resemble, both in flavor and appearance.

Gooseberry Jelly. — This is made exactly as 
black currant jelly; use no water with the fruit, 
but press it firmly, and make the remains of the 
pulp into jam; if desired to remove the skins, pass 
the pulp through a colander, allow one pound of 
sugar for one of jam. 

Gooseberry and Raspberry Jelly. — Take 
any quantity of fine red gooseberries, a quarter as 
many white ones, and half a quarter as many rasp- 
berries ; pick the fruits, and put them in a kettle 
for preserves, with as many pounds of sugar in 
pieces as you have pounds of fruit. Boil over a 
quick fire, slumming carefully, and continue boiling 
until your jelly, turned upon a napkin, fixes or con- 
geals in a moment. This is a proof that your jelly 
is sufficiently cooked. Remove it from the fire, 
and turn it through a hair sieve. Let it drain 
without squeezing, and turn the first results into 
your pots. This will be a jelly of the first quality, 
of a beautiful ruby tint, and perfectly transparent. 
Afterwards squeeze and express the remainder into 
another vase. This second part is as good as the 
•first, but it has not its transparency. 

Red Gooseberry Jam. — Take the eyes and tails 
from a quantity of red, hairy gooseberries, quite ripe, 
and put them into a preserving-pan M^ith half a 
pint of red currant juice to each half-a-dozen pounds. 
Let them boil until they are all broken and mashed, 
which you must aid with a wooden spoon. Then 



282 PRESERVES AND JELLIES. 

for every pound of gooseberries add a pound c^ 
sugar, sprinkling it over the fruit. Let the whole 
simmer until reduced to the proper consistence of 
jam, taking care that it does not burn during the 
operation. Then put it into pots. 

Green Gooseberry Jam. — Gather the finest 
green gooseberries when quite ripe ; take off the tails 
and eyes. Put the berries into ajar, and set them 
in a kettle of boiling water over the fire, until they 
begin to break. Then put them into a preserving 
pan. Use a pound of sugar for each pound of 
gooseberries. Add it to the fruit, which you must 
break as it boils. "When of the consistence of jam, 
put it into pots. 

White Gooseberry Jam. — This jam is made 
with the large white gooseberry, which must be 
quite ripe and fresh-gathered. Treat it exactly in 
the same manner as directed for red gooseberry jam, 
omitting the red currant juice. 

Dried Strawberries. — Put three pounds of 
strawberries into a large dish, and sprinkle six 
pounds of white sugar over them. Let them stand* 
until the next day, then scald them and put them 
back into the dish. On the third day place another 
pound of sugar over them, and scald them again. 
In two days more repeat the process. After this, 
place the strawberries on a hair-sieve to drain, and 
then on fresh plates every day, until they are dried* 
They must be kept in tin canisters. 



PRESERVES AND JELLIES. 283 

To Preserve. Strawberries. — To two p )un(l3 
of fine large strawberries, add two pounds of pow- 
dered sugar, and put them in a preserving kettle, 
over a slow fire, till the sugar is melted ; then boil 
them precisely twenty minutes, as fast as possible ; 
have ready a number of small jars, and put the 
fruit in boiling hot. Cork and seal the jars imme- 
diately, and keep them through the summer in a 
cold, dry place. The jars must be heated before the 
hot fruit is poured in, otherwise they will break. 

Strawberry Jelly. — Express the juice from 
the fruit through a cloth, strain it clear, weigh, and 
stir to it an equal proportion of the finest sugar 
dried and reduced to powder ; when this is dissolved, 
place the preserving-pan over a veiy clear fire, and 
stir the jelly often until it boils; clear it carefully 
from scum, and boil it quickly from fifteen to twen- 
ty-five minutes. This receipt is for a moderate 
quantity of the preserve ; a very small portion will 
require much less time. 

Strawberry Jam. — Put the fruit into a jar, 
and stand this in a pan of boiling water over the 
fire. As the boiling proceeds, keep mashing the 
Btrawberries with a wooden spoon until they are all 
bruised to a pulp. Then put them into a preserv- 
ing-pan, and to every ]>ound add three-quarters of 
a pound of sugar. Boil the whole until of due 
consistence, which will occupy more than half an 
hour ; keeping the jam in constant agitation, lest 



284 PRESERVES AND JELLIES. 

the bottom should burn. When done enouo;h, take 
it off the fire and put it into pots. 

Preserved Pineapple. — Twist out the crown 
of the pineapple, and pare off the hard yellow rind ; 
next slice the fruit about half an inch thick, and 
trim it quite clean around the edges, taking care of 
the trimmings. Put them into a preserving pan 
with one quart of cold water, and boil till reduced 
to half a pint ; strain it, then put the slices on the 
lire with the juice and equal weight of fine white 
sugar ; boil gently half an hour. 

Or : Make a thin syrup, a quart of water to two 
pounds of sugar. While this is dissolving, prepare 
the pineapples, eight medium-sized ones, by remov- 
ing the skin, and cutting the flesh into slices, about 
half an inch thick. AVhen the sugar is dissolved, 
and while the syrup is still hot, throw in the fruit. 
Give one boil up ; let it boil for a quarter of an 
hour, and put it aside to cool. When cool, boil up 
again, and repeat this three times. This is some 
trouble; but the pineapple will not be enough 
cooked with less than three-quarters of an hour's 
boiling, and if boiled for that time without a break, 
it is apt to get pappy. Lastly, make a thick syrup 
of four pounds of sugar to a quart of water, and 
add this to the other while both are hot. Bcil up 
once more for a few minutes, and put away in a 
well-corked or stoppered bottle with a wide mouth. 
The preserve made as above is most delicious. 



PRESERVES AND JELLIES. 285 

Pineapples without Cooking. — Peel very 
ripe pineapples, cut them in slices, take out the 
cores, and weigh the fruit ; allow a pound of double- 
refined loaf sugar to every pound of fruit. Spread 
the sugar evenly over the fruit ; pack it in layers, 
and let it stand twenty-four hours ; then drain off 
the syrup, and boil it as long as any impurities rise 
to the surface ; skim it constantly, and pour it over 
the fruit boiling hot. 

Pineapple Jelly. — This is set with isinglass. 
To every quart of syrup allow one ounce of shred 
isinglass. To make the syrup, allow to a pint of 
juice a pound of the best loaf sugar. 

Pineapple Marmalade. — To -every pound of 
grated pineapple allow a pound of double-refined 
loaf sugar. Boil until thick ; then pack in tumb- 
lers, and paste over them papers wet with the 
])eaten whites of eggs. Keep in a dry, cool place 
until wanted. 

Pineapple Preserve. — Twist off the top and 
bottom, and pare off the rough outside of pineapples ; 
then weigh them, and cut them in slices, chips, or 
quarters, or cut them into four or six, and shape 
each piece like a whole pineapple ; to each pound 
of fruit put a teacup of water ; put it in a preserving 
kettle; cover it, and set it over the fire, and let them 
boil gently until they are tender and (jlear ; then 
take them from the water by sticking a fork in the 
centre of each slice, or with a skimmer, into a dish. 



2vSG PRESERVES AND JELLIES. 

Put to the water white sugar, a pound for each 
pound of fruit ; stir it until it is all dissolved ; then 
put in the pineapple, cover the kettle, and let it 
boil gently until transparent throughout; when 
it is so, take it out, kt it cool, and put it into glass 
jars ; as soon as the syrup is a little cooled, pour 
it over them ; let them remain in a cool place until 
the next day, then secure the jars, by tying them 
over in the usual manner. Pineapple done in 
this way is a delicious preserve, but in preserving 
it, by putting it into the syrup without first boiling 
it, makes it little better than sweetened leather. 

Ehubarb Jam. — Out into pieces about an inch 
long (not peeled), put three-quarters of a pound of 
powdered lump sugar to every pound of rhubarb, 
and leave till morning ; pour the syrup from it and 
boil till it thiokens, then add the rhubarb and boil 
gently a quarter of an hour ; tie down with tissue- 
paper dipped in white of egg. It will keep good 
for a year, and is excellent. 

Rhubarb Preserve. — To every six pounds of 
rhubarb add six pounds of sugar and a quarter of a 
pound of bruised ginger ; the rhubarb to be cut into 
pieces two inches long and put into a stone jar, 
with the sugar in layers, till the sugar is dissolved ; 
take the juice or syrup and boil it with the ginger 
for half an hour, then add the rhubarb and boil 
another half hour. 

Plums. — Prick them with a needle to prevent.

bursting, siimuer them very gently in thin syrup, 
put lliem into a china bowl, and, when cold, pour 
the syrup over. Let them lie three days, then 
make a syrup of three pounds of sugar to five pounds 
of fruit, with no more water than hangs to large 
lumps of the sugar dipped quickly and instantly 
brought out. Boil the plums in this fresh syrup, 
after draining them from the first ; do them very 
gently till they are clear and the syrup adheres to 
tliem ; put them one by one into small pots, and 
pour the liquor over them. 

To Preserve Purple Plums. — Make a syrup 
of clean brown sugar; clarify it; when perfectly 
clear and boiling hot, pour it over the plums, hav- 
ing picked out all unsound ones and stems; let them 
remain in the syrup two days, then drain it off, make 
it boiling hot, skim it, and pour it over again ; let 
them remain another day or two, then put them in a 
preserving-kettle over the fire, and simmer gently 
until the syrup is reduced, and thick or rich. One 
pound of sugar for each pound of plums. 

Preserved Cherries. — Take large cherries not 
very ripe; stew and stone them; save what juice 
runs from them ; take an equal weight of white 
sugar ; make the syrup of a teacup of water for each 
I)ound, set it over the fruit until it is dissolved and 
boiling hot, then put in the juice and cherries, boil 
them gently until clear throughout ; take them from 
the syrup with a skimmer, and spread them on flat 
dishes to cool ; let the syrup boil until it is rich and

quite tliick ; set it to cool and settle; take the fruit 
into jars and pots, and pour the syrup carefully 
over ; let them remain open till the next day ; then 
cover as directed. Sweet cherries are improved by 
the addition of a pint of red currant-juice, and half 
a pound of sugar to it, for four or five poundh of 
cherries. 

Cheery Maemalade or Jam. — Take out the 
stones and stalks from some fine cherries, and pulp 
them through a cane sieve ; to every three pounds 
of pulp add half a pint of currant-juice, and three- 
quarters of a pound of sugar to each pound of fruit ; 
mix together, and boil until it will jelly. Put it 
into pots or glasses. 

Spiced Cherries. — Seven pounds of sour cher- 
ries seeded, three pounds of sugar, one pint of 
vinegar, cinnamon, cloves, and mace. Boil six 
times ; last time put cherries in and let it come to a 
boil. 

Bottling Cherries. — To every pound of fruit 
add six ounces of powdered lump sugar. Fill the 
jars with fruit, sliake the sugar over, and tie each 
jar down with two bladders, as there is danger of 
one bursting during the boiling. Place the jars in 
a boiler of cold water, and after the water has 
boiled, let them remain three hours ; take them out, 
and when cool, put them in a dry place, where they 
will keep over a year. 

Cherry or Strawberry Fool. — Pick tha

stems from your fruit; if cherries, stone them, 
bruise them to a pulp, add a sufficiency of loaf 
sugar pounded and sifted, and half a pint of cream 
to a pint of pulp ; put it into custard-glasses with a 
layer of raw cream upon the top, and serve. Some 
housekeepers, to avoid the trouble of frequent bak- 
ings, line several tart-dishes with an edge of crust ; 
bake them and keep them for use as required, when 
some preserve or raw fruit as above may be simply 
laid in, and au easy-made tart produced upon an 
emergency. 

Cherry Jam. — To every pound of fruit, weighed 
before stoning, allow half a pound of sugar; to 
every six pounds of fruit allow one pint of red cur- 
rant-juice, and to every pint, one pound of sugar. 
Weigh the fruit before stoning, and allow half the 
weight of sugar ; stone the cherries, and boil them 
in a preserving-pan until nearly all the juice is 
dried up ; then add the sugar, which should be 
crushed to powder, and the currant-juice, allowing 
one pint to every six pounds of cherries, (original 
weight,) and one pound of sugar to every pint of 
juice. Boil all together until it jellies, which will 
be in from twenty minutes to half an hour ; skim 
the jam well, keep it well stirred, and, a few minutes 
before it is done, crack some of the stones and add 
the kernels. 

Currant Jelly. — Pick fine red, but long ripe 
currants from the stems; bruise them, and strain 
the juice from a quart at a time through a thin

muslin ; wring it gently, to get all the liquid ; put 
a pound of white sugar to each pound of juice ; 
stir it until it is all dissolved; set it over a gentle 
fire ; let it become hot, and boil for fifteen minutes ; 
then try it by taking a spoonful into a saucer ; when 
cold, if it is not quite firm enough, boil it for a few 
minutes longer. 

Black Currant Jelly. — It is necessary to add 
a little water to the fruit, in order to strain it, it is 
so very thick, unless jam is made at the same time, 
when a part can be strained for the jelly, and the 
remainder used for jam. After it is boiled so as to 
heat the fruit through, press it little by little until 
all the juice is extracted ; measure the juice, and 
allow one pound of sugar to every pint of juice; 
mix the juice and sugar, and boil ten minutes 
gently, stirring constantly,, when it will be ready 
to put in moulds. Cover with paper wet with 
brandy. 

Black Currant Jam. — To every pound of 
black currants pulped, put a pound of sugar. Boil 
up Uie fruit, stirring it continually, until reduced 
by evaporation to the proper consistence. Jams 
may also be made of red and Mdiite currants, but 
as they are scarcely ever used, the jelly being so 
much preferred, few persons make them. The 
black currant is one of the most wholesome of 
jams, and certainly very useful. It has many 
medicinal virtues, in addition to its agreeable fla-

vor. As a foundatidh in a glass of whipped cream, 
it is delicious. 

To Can Fruit and Vegetables. — Peaches 
should be skinned and cut in halves if clingstones, 
or quartered if freestone, and thrown into water to 
keep fresh. Put them in a can, adding half as 
much sugar as fruit, in alternate layers. Let stand 
until the sugar is dissolved, then put in a preserving 
kettle and let boil until the fruit is boiling-hot. At 
once fill the cans and seal tight. 

Raspberries, and such other small fruit, are done 
as follows: Pick and wash the fruit carefully, and 
to every pound of fruit add half a pound of sugar. 
Put in a vessel in alternate layers and let stand for 
one hour. Boil in preserving-kettle for ten min- 
utes, can whilst hot. No water need be used, as 
the fruit yields sufficient juice. 

Corn, peas, okra, etc. : Boil for half an hour, with 
just sufficient water to cover them ; can whilst hot. 
The corn, of course, should be cobbed before boiling. 

Tomatoes : Scald only enough to remove the 
skins, boil for half an hour in their own juice. Can 
boiling-hot. 

To seal hermetically, place the jars in a pan of 
hot water, which will expel the air, seal at once, and 
the fruit will keep an indefinite period. 

Brandy Peaches. — Four pounds of ripe peaches, 
two pounds of powdered loaf sugar. Put the fruit 
over the fire in cold water, simmer, but not boil, till 
the skins will rub off easily ; stone them, if liked. 



292 PRESERVES AND JELLIES. 

Put the sugar and fruit in alternate layers in the jars 
till filled, then pour in white brandy, and cover the 
whole. Cork tightly. 

Quinces Preserved Whole. — Pare and put 
them into a saucepan, with the parings at the top, 
then fill it with hard water, cover it close, set it over 
a gentle fire till they turn reddish. Let them stand 
till cold, put them into a clear, thick syrup, boil 
them for a few minutes; set them on one side till 
quite cold, boil them again in the same manner. 
Tlie next day boil them until they look clear. If 
the syrup is not thick enough, boil it more. When 
cold, put brandied paper over them. The quinces 
may be halved or quartered. 

Quince Marmalade. — To one gallon of quinces 
three pounds of good loaf sugar. Pare the quinces 
and cut them in halves, scoop out the cores and the 
hard strip that unites the core with the string. Put 
the cores and some of the parings in a saucepan 
with about a quart of water; put the halves of 
quinces in .a steamer that fits the saucepan, boil them 
until the quinces are softened by the steam, then 
mash them with a wooden spoon in a dish and pour 
the water from the saucepan on them, which is now 
of a thick glutinous substance. Put them with the 
sugar in a stewpan or enamelled saucepan, and let 
them boil for about half an hour, keeping them well 
Btirred. 

Quince Jelly. — Take some sound, yellow

quinces, which are not over ripe; peel them, cut 
them in quarters, and boil them in as much water 
as will cover them. When they have been well 
boiled, squeeze them through a linen cloth, clarify 
the juice in a filtering-bag, weigh it, and put it with 
three-quarters of its weight of sugar in a brass ket- 
tle. Do not forget to put in a piece of cinnamon. 
Cook the whole together until it has become a jelly. 
Take it from the fire, and tie up in pots when it is 
cold. 

Quinces for the Tea Table. — Bake ripe 
quinces thoroughly. When cold, strip off the skins, 
place them in a glass dish, and sprinkle with white 
sugar, and serve them with cream. They make a 
fine looking dish for the tea table, and a more lus- 
cious and inexpensive one than the same fruit made 
into sweetmeats. Those who once taste the fruit 
thus prepared will probably desire to store away a 
few bushels in the fall to use in the above manner. 

Quince and Apple Jelly. — Cut small and 
core an equal weight of tart apples and quinces. 
Put the quinces in a preserving-kettle, with water 
to cover them, and boil till soft ; add the apples, 
still keeping water to cover them, and boil till the 
whole is nearly a pulp. Put the whole into a jelly- 
bag and strain without pressing. To each quart of 
juice allow two pounds of lump sugar. Boil together 
half an hour. 

Apple Jelly. — Cut off all s])ots and decayed

places on the apples, quarter them, but do not pare 
or core them. Put in the peel of as many lemons 
as you like, about two to six or eight dozen of the 
apples. Fill the preserving-pan, and cover the fruit 
with spring water. Boil them till they are in pulp, 
then pour them into a jelly-bag ; let them strain all 
night; do not squeeze them. To every pint of 
juice put one pound of white sugar. Put in the 
juice of the lemons you had before pared, but strain 
it through muslin. You may also put in about a 
teaspoonful of essence of lemon, let it boil for at 
least twenty minutes ; it will look redder than at 
first; skim it well all the time. Put it either in 
shapes or pots, and cover it the next day. It ought 
to be quite stiff and very clear. 

Apple Jam. — The apples, which should be ripe, 
and of the best eating sort, being pared and quar- 
tered, are put into a pan with just water to cover 
them, and boiled until they can be reduced to a 
mash. Then, for each pound of the pared apples, a 
pound of sifted sugar is added, being sprinkled over 
the boiling mixture. Boil and stir it well until re- 
duced to a jam ; then put it into pots. 

The above is the most simple way of making it; 
but to have it of the best possible clearneas, make a 
thick syrup with three pounds of sugar to each pint 
of water, and clarify it with an egg, as before directed. 
Then add one pint of this syrup for every three 
pounds of apples, and boil the jam to a propei 
thickness.

Apple Marmalade. — This is a useful thing to 
make, as it may be put aside for future use, and 
will keep a long time. Pare, core, and cut your 
apples into small pieces, put them into water with a 
little lemon -juice to keep them white; take them 
out after a short time and drain them, weigh and 
put them into a stewpan, with an equal quantity of 
sugar, a stick of cinnamon, and the juice of a lemon. 
Place the stewpan over a brisk fire and cover it. 
When the apples are pulped, stir the mixture until 
it becomes of a proper consistency, and put the mar- 
malade into pots. 

Apple Preserve. — Procure fresh gathered ripe 
apples of a fine sort, peel them, take out the cores, 
and cut them in quarters. Place them in a preserv- 
ing-pan, with a glass of water, a little lemon or or- 
ange-peel, and a pound of sugar to a pound and a 
half of fruit. Let it boil thoroughly, and then put 
t out into preserve pots. 

Crab Apple Jam. — Pare the crab apples when 
quite ripe, put them into a stone jar, cover it well, 
and put it in a pan of boiling water for an hour and 
a half. Then prepare the syrup with two pounds 
of sugar in half a pint of water for every pound of 
the apples. Clarify the syrup. Then put the ap- 
ples into it and boil the whole to a jam. 



CHAPTER IX. 

butter, cheese and eggs. 

Butter that threatens to turn rancid. — 
Butter that has not been properly churned, or that 
has not been carefully separated from the butter- 
milk, has been improperly packed, or from any 
other cause threatens to turn rancid, should be 
immediately washed and kneaded in spring water, 
changing the water several times, then resalted with 
salt pounded as fine as possible, and sifted through 
a hair sieve. 

Butter making. — Strain away the milk in Jlat, 
stone jars nicely cleaned and scalded. Skim the 
cream off when it rises. In the summer season the 
ci'aam should not be kept longer than twenty-four 
hours before it is churned. After churning take 
the butter up in a wooden bowl without any water 
at all, and let it set by over night, and in the morn- 
ing, while cool and pleasant, beat it well and season 
with salt to taste. After a day or two it should be 
beaten over again to get all the milk out of it (for 
this is the true secret of keeping butter well). 
Season it with a little more salt, and pack.

BUTTER, CHEESE AND EGGS. 297 

To Preserve Butter. — Take good, sweet, June 
butter, work the buttermilk carefully out ; then add 
a handful of salt to a pound of butter ; pack a good 
layer of butter in your stone jar, then a layer of 
salt; repeat until the jar i^ full ; then place a good 
weight on top, and stand in a good cool place ; cover 
with brine, to bear an egg. 

Curled Butter. — Tie a strong cloth by two of 
the corners to an iron hook in the wall ; make a 
knot with the other two ends so that a stick might 
pass through. Put the butter into the cloth ; twist 
it tightly over a dish, into which the butter will 
fall through the knot, so forming small and pretty 
little strings. The butter may then be garnished 
with parsley, if to serve with a cheese course ; or it 
may be sent to table plain for breakfast in an orna- 
mental dish. Squirted butter for garnishing hams, 
salads, eggs, etc., is made by forming a piece of 
stiff paper in the shape of a cornet, and squeezing 
the butter in fine strings from the hole at the 
bottom. Scooped butter is made by dipping a 
teaspoon or scooper in warm water, and then 
scooping the butter quickly and thin. In warm 
weather, it would not be necessary to heat the 
spoon. 

Rajstcid Butter, boiled in water with a portion 
of charcoal (say a tenth part), will be entirely 
divested of its rancidity, and may be used for cook- 
ing purposes, although its fine flavor will not be 
restored for the table.

MANUFACTURE OF PINEAPPLE AND POTATO 
CHEESES. 

The Netherlanders supply the market with what 
is popularly known as "pineapj^le" cheese. Very 
excellent cheese it is, too — this Dutch pineapple — 
keeping in all climates capitally, and always com- 
manding ready sale at good prices. This is the 
Hollanders' formula for making Edam or pine- 
apple cheese. It is simple enough, and the Holland 
"pine-apples" may just as easily be made in Ame- 
rica, wherever four or five cows are kept, as it is in 
the Netherlands. 

The fresh sweet milk is curdled with muriatic 
acid or spirits of salt, and the curd cut and chopped 
and manipulated in the most thorough manner in 
order to expel every particle of whey. The curd 
is then soaked in a brine of sufficient strength to 
float an egg for an hour. The brine is then worked 
out, and the curd subjected to a heavy pressure in 
iron moulds, that give the pineapple form to the 
cheese. After from four to five hours' pressing, the 
cheese is taken from the form and anointed with 
soft butter, having as much fine salt worked into it 
as it will hold. Thus finished up they set singly 
in rows on shelves in a cool, airy place, and with a 
month's curing are in a fit condition to send abroad, 
and will keep for years in any climate. 

The largest of these Dutch cheeses never exceed 
four and a half pounds weight, to make one of

^^'hioll requires about six gallons of milk. So at 
•my farm-house, where three or four cows only are 
kept, an Edam cheese may be made every day with- 
out interfering with other duties, and the aggregate 
for a year would make a very respectable increase 
of income. 

In Saxony the smalles farmers manufacture very 
palatable cheese from the milk of a single cow by 
the addition of potatoes. The potatoes are boiled 
until perfectly cooked, then mashed, and to four 
pounds of potatoes one quart of thick sour milk is 
added, with salt enough to season, and the mass 
kneaded as thoroughly as bread dough. In four 
days it receives another vigorous kneading, and is 
divided into balls of three to five pounds weight, 
pressed with the hand as compact as possible into 
small baskets, and dried, in summer, in the shade; 
in winter, by the fire or stove. When thoroughly 
dry, the cheese is put into tin cans, sealed up, and 
set by for use in a cool, dry place. 

Cheese Biscuit. — Two ounces of butter, two 
ounces of flour, two ounces of grated cheese,^ little 
Cayenne, and salt. To be made into a thin paste 
and rolled out very thin, then cut 'in pieces four 
inches long and one inch broad, bake a very light 
brown, and send to table as hot as possible. 

Cheesecake. — Bruise one cottage cheese with 
one-eighth of a pound of butter, add four eggs

thick gruel ; sweeten to taste ; add one-half a 
lemon and spice to your liking. Bake with bottom 
crust. 

Buttermilk Cheese. — Scald the buttermilk; 
then set it over the fire to boil ; skim the top, and 
put it in a jug to drain ; add a little salt, and it is 
ready for use. 

Potted Cheese. — This is a useful luncheon 
dish, and, being in a glass jar, it looks light and 
pretty on the table. One pound of cheese must be 
well beaten in a mortar, and to it must be added 
two ounces of liquid butter, one glass of sherry, 
and a very small quantity of Cayenne pepper, mace, 
and salt. All should be well beaten together and 
put into a pretty-shaped glass potting-jar, with a 
layer of butter at the top. It makes a delicious 
relish for bread or toast. 

Cheese Straws, No. 1. — Haifa pound of puff- 
paste, three ounces of Parmesan cheese, grated, a 
little Cayenne pepper, salt and black pepper, roll 
it verf thin, cut it in narrow strips, bake in a 
moderate oven, and serve hot. 

2. Quarter of a pound of flour, and two ounces 
of butter worked through the flour with the fingers, 
and rubbed till quite smooth ; two ounces of grated 
cheese, the yelks of two eggs, and the white of one. 
Season to taste with Cayenne pepper and a small 
pinch of salt. Mix all together, roll it out thin, 



BUTTER, CHEESE AND EGGS. 301 

place it on a well-buttered tin pan ; cut into narrow 
strips about five inches long. Remove from the tin 
carefully, after baking ten minutes. 

3. Quarter of a pound of puiF-paste, a quarter of 
an ounce of Parmesan (or any other good cheese) 
grated very fine, a little salt and Cayenne pepper 
mixed, sprinkle the cheese, salt and pepper over the 
paste, and roll it two or three times ; cut it into 
narrow strips about five inches long. Bake them 
in a slow oven, and serve hot. 

Cream Cheese. — The cream cheese we make 
at home is much admired. We put a quart of 
cream into a clean jug, with half a teaspoonful of 
salt stirred in, and let it stand a day or two till 
thickish. Then we fold an ordinary grass cloth 
about six or eight times, and sprinkle it with salt, 
then lay it in a sieve about eight inches in diameter. 
The gides of the cloth should come up well over the 
sieve. Then pour in the cream, and sprinkle a 
little salt on it. Change the cloth as often as it 
becomes moist, and as the cheese dries press it with 
the cloth and sieve. In about a week or nine days 
it will be prime and fit to eat. The air alone 
suffices to turn the cream into cheese. • 

Another : Take about half a pint of cream, tie it 
up in a piece of thin muslin, and suspend it in a 
cool place. After five or six days take it out of 
the muslin, and put it between two plates, witli 
a small weight on the upper one. This will

make it a good shape for the table, and also help 
to ripen the cheese, which will be fit to use in 
about eight days from the comnieneeinent of the 
making. 

HOW TO COOK AND SERVE EGGS. 

When we inform our readers that in the wide 
and ever-extending circle of French cookery, no less 
than six hundred and eighty-five ways of preparing 
eggs are recognized, it will be obvious to them that 
our chief difficulty has been, in preparing this 
collection, what to choose, and what to avoid. Our 
principle has been to present to our readers the 
choicest, the most useful, and palatable varieties. 

Eggs, Plain Boiled. — This being beyond ques- 
tion the most popular way of serving eggs, we 
must commence by giving it in the approved French 
method. Get ready a saucepan of boiling water, 
place in it some fresh eggs, immediately remove 
the saucepan from the fire, put on the lid, and let 
the eggs remain exactly four minutes. Take them 
up, and serve them, well warmed, in a dish. The 
eggs, if so preferred, may be put into cold water 
over a quick fire, and when the water comes to a 
boil, they are done. 

Eggs sur le Plat. — Heat some butter upon a 
tin or pewter dish ; carefully break into it as many 
eggs as you think sufficient; arranging them neatly; 
season with salt and pepper ; add a few teaspoonfuls 



BUTTER, CHEESE AND EGGS. 303 

of good, thick cream, and place the dish for six 
minutes over a clear fire, and serve dirretly. 

EoG-BALLS. — Take the yelks of six hard-boiled 
eggs; pound them in a mortar, together with a 
little salt, one dessertspoonful of flour, and a small 
quantity of pepper. When a smooth, but stiff paste 
is formed, add as much raw yelk of egg as will 
serve to mix it of the consistency required. Make 
it into balls, and serve them upon buttered toast. 

Lait de Poule. — Beat until light the yelks of 
two fresh eggs, add two teaspoonfuls of powdered 
loaf sugar, and the same quantity of orange flower 
water. Stir quickly and add a teacupful of boiling 
water. Drink while hot. 

Eggs a L'Aedennaise.— ^Break the'shells of 
one dozen eggs. Separate the yelks from the whites 
and keep each yelk by itself. Beat the whites to a 
froth ; add to them a little salt, pepper and thick 
cream. Pour the mixture into a well-buttered 
deep dish, and arrange the yelks upon the top. 
Put the dish into a gentle oven, and, when set, 
serve hot. 

Eggs a L'Aurore. — Boil some eggs until they 
are hard. Remove the shells ; cut each egg in half 
and scoop out the yelks, put these into a mortar with 
some pepper, salt, savory herbs and cream. Beat 
all to a paste; place some of it in each halved whiie 
of egg, and lay the remainder in a buttered dish. 
Arrange the stuffed eggs on the top with the forced 
30

meat uppermost. Brown in a moderate oven, and 
serve hot. 

Broiled Eggs. — Cut a large round of bread ; 
toast it on both sides, and butter it. Carefully 
break six eggs, and arrange them upon the toast ; 
sprinkle over them some salt and pepper, and 
slowly pass a red-hot shovel up and down over 
them until they are well set. Squeeze upon them 
the juice of an orange, and strew over a little 
grated nutmeg. Serve as quickly as possible. 
If preferred, the toasted bread may be dipped 
into some warmed cream, and some poached eggs 
placed upon it, and then glazed with a red-hot 
shovel. 

MiNCEp Eggs. — Shell four or five hard-boiled 
eggs, and mince them ; but not very fine. Thicken 
a breakfastcupful of gravy or milk, with sufficient 
flour rolled in butter; add some savory herbs, 
chopped small ; season with Cayenne or white 
pepper, a little nutmeg, and salt ; simmer it for ten 
minutes, put in the. eggs, shake it gently round and 
round over the fire for a few moments, and serve 
garnished with sippets of toast and small pieces of 
sliced lemon. Any particular flavor may be given 
to this dish, to suit the taste. 

Brown Eggs. — Hard boil some eggs, put them 
into cold water, shell them and slice them ; lay 
them upon hot buttered toast, and season them 
according to taste. Strew fried bread crumbs over 



BUrrER, CHEESE AND EGGS. 305 

theui, then sprinkle them with catsup and brown 
thejn. 

Egg Dumplings. — Make a batter of a pint of 
milk, two well-beaten eggs, a teaspoonful of salt, 
and flour enough to make a batter as thick as for 
pound cake. Have a clean saucepan of boiling 
water; let the water boil fast; drop in the batter 
W'ith a tablespoon. Four or five minutes will boil 
them. Take them with a skimmer on a dish ; put 
A bit of butter and pepper over them, and serve 
with boiled or cold meat. To serve sweet, put 
butter and grated nutmeg, with syrup or sugar 
over it. 

Rumbled Eggs. — Very convenient for invalids, 
or, when required, a light dish for supper. Beat 
up three eggs with two ounces of fresh butter, or 
well- washed salt butter; add a teaspoonful of cream 
or new milk. Put all in a saucepan and keep stir- 
ring it over the fire for nearly five minutes, until it 
rises up like souffle, when it should be immediately 
dished on buttered toast. 

Omelette Soufflee. — Put three tablespoonfuls 
of sugar in a bowl with four yelks of eggs, and 
mix them well, addiug a few drops of essence. 
(Omelette soufflde is an entremet and comes after 
the vegetables.) Then beat the whites, adding a 
pinch of salt, and mix with the rest, putting in 
tw3 tablespoonfuls of the mixture with the whites 
at first, and then adding the rest. Stir gently 



306 BUTTER, CHEESE AND EGGS. 

until well mixed, and serve in the dish that it is 
cooked in. After putting it in the pan smooth 
with a knife, dust with powdered sugar and 
bake. The salt is added to the white of egg to 
prevent its curdling. The omelette is cooked at 
310° Fahrenheit. For puff-paste, 500°. It must 
be served at once, as it falls rapidly. Powder with 
sugar and serve. 

Omelette a la Creppe. — Put into a basin 
eight tablespoonfuls of flour ; beat six eggs into it, 
with as much milk as will make it into a batter, 
with a pinch of salt. Bake till brown. 

Egg Cheesecakes. — Twelve eggs, boiled hard 
and rubbed through a sieve (wliile hot), with half a 
pound of butter ; then add half a pound of pounded 
loaf sugar, half a pound oi' currants, and a little 
nutmeg. Brandy may be added, which flavors them 
nicely ; or, if preferred, a few drops of essence of 
lemon or almonds. 

Egg Sandwiches. — Hard boil some very fresh 
eggs, and, when cold, cut them into moderately thin 
slices, and lay them between some bread and butter 
cut as thin as possible ; season them well with pep- 
per, salt, and nutmeg. For picnic parties, or when 
one is travelling, these sandwiches are far preferable 
to hard-boiled eggs au nahirel.' 

Preserving Eggs. — In order to keep well, eggs 
must be perfectly fresh when packed. Take a stone 
pot wliich will hold three gallons ; pack the eggs 



BUTTEE, CHEESE AND EGGS. 307 

closely, sharp end down. Suit one pint of un- 
slacked lime, and dissolve it in sufficient water to 
cover the eggs. When cold, pour it over them, be- 
ing sure no eggs float. 

Egg Omelette. — Scald one pint of new milk ; 
into this stir the yelks of five eggs, and a table- 
spoonful each of sugar and flour. Beat the whites 
of the eggs till stiff, and add to the yelks ; beat all 
well together, and bake in a quick oven. 

Buttered Eggs. — Four eggs, well beaten ; three 
tablespoon fuls of cream or rich unskimmed milk, a 
little grated tongue or ham, pepper, salt, and thiee 
ounces of butter. Put all the ingredients, excepting 
the eggs, into a stewpan and heat ; when quite hot, 
add the eggs, and stir while cooking till quite thick. 
Spread upon buttered toast, and serve hot. 

Bacon Omelette. — Either simply mince some 
cold boiled bacon, and mix it with eggs which have 
been spiced and well beaten ; or take some raw 
bacon, chop it well, toss it in a frying-pan till nicely 
browned, and then pour the beaten eggs upon it ; or, 
place the tossed bacon upon some eggs that you 
nave just poured into a frying-pan ; when set, fold 
the omelette, and serve with a tomato sauce in the 
dish. 

Kidney Omelette. — Remove all skin, fat, and 
sinew from a fresh kidney, whether sheep's or calf's. 
Cut it small, season it well, and fry it quickly in hot 
butter. Beat six eggs together with a glassful of 



308 BUTTER, CHEESE AND EGGS. 

white M'ine ; heat a little butter in the frying-pan, 
pour in the eggs, and before they are regularly set 
place the kidney in the middle; turn in the ends 
of the omelette and serve ; garnish with thin slices 
of lemon quartered. 

Omelette aux Croutons. — Beat the yelks of 
six and the whites of four eggs ; season with salt 
and spice according to taste. Cut some nice little 
pieces of bread no larger than dice; fry them in 
butter till they are well browned, then throw them 
quickly into boiling gravy or milk, or sauce of any 
particular flavor; mix them with the beaten egg, 
and fry as an ordinary omelette. 



CHAPTER X. 

BREAD, BISCUIT, CAKES AND YEAST. 

Bread. — Sot your sponge over night with one- 
half pint of lukewarm water, one teacupful of 
yea^t, and one pint of flour (measure before sifting). 
In the morning warm half a cup of milk (or water 
with a little butter in it), and stir into the sponge 
wnth one tablespoonful of lime-water, and one and 
one-half pint of flour. Knead into two loaves and 
put them in your pans to rise, they will bake in 
about half an hour. 

Rolls and Bread (Superior). — Sift three 
quarts of flour. Take two eggs, one teacupful and 
a half of liquid yeast, two pints of lukewarm water, 
one tablespoonful of brown sugar, one of salt, and 
four handfuls of flour taken from the measured 
flour. Beat the eggs .very light, and make these 
ingredients into a smooth batter. After the batter 
is well beaten, divide the remaining flour into two 
equal parts, and put one part of the flour into a tin 
pan or bucket, pour in the batter, and cover it with 
the remainder of the flour. Set it in a moderately 
warm place, and, in an hour and a half, or when 
light, turn the whole out and work it well. It may 
require more flour in kneading it. Work it quickly, 

3U9 



310 BREAD, BISCUIT, CAKES AND YEAST. 

but not until it is cold, and set it to rise again, rub- 
bing a little lard over the top of the dough. In 
three or four hours it will be ready to knead over 
again, and, after it has risen a second time, it is 
ready for baking in a quick oven. If you wish 
rolls, work in a spoonful of lard durmg the last 
kneading, and mould the dough into small cakes. 
Do not keep the dough too warm, and it will be 
more flaky. If you wish a smaller loaf of bread, 
use only a pint and a half of water in making 
up the batter, but do not diminish the other ingre- 
dients. 

Bread Receipt. — Take three pints of warm 
water, one tablespoonful of lard, one teacupful of 
warm yeast ; thicken with flour to form a dough. 
Let it stand to rise, then work into loaves. Let it 
rise fifteen or twenty minutes, then bake about 
three-quarters of an hour. 

Wheaten Bread. — One spoonful of hop yeast, 
two potatoes boiled, and one pint of water ; make 
a sponge, and when light, or sufficiently raised, mix 
hard and let rise, and when it is light again, mould 
it over, and bake while light. 

Another way. — Grate half a dozen potatoes, 
and add one quart of water ; put in one cup of hop 
yeast at night, and in the morning, when light, add 
three teaspoonfuls of sugar, and flour to form a 
dough. Let it rise; when light, put it in tins; let 
it rise again, and bake for half an hour. 



BREAD, BISCUIT, CAKES AND YEAST. 311 

Potato Bread. — Take four or five good mealy 
potatoes, and after boiling, peel and masli well ; add 
a large spoonful of flour and enough hot water to 
make a thin batter; when cool enough, add a small 
(pmntity of good yeast and a spoonful of -sugar; set 
to rise in a moderately warm place, say by the stove 
o\- fire-place ; it rises very c^uickly. When risen, 
take two large spoonfuls of it for a pint and a half 
of flour, a small spoonful of lard or butter, a half 
pint of milk, and hot water enough to make into 
a stiff batter, (over night ;) beat well ; next morn- 
ing work it well into a smooth dough and make 
into rolls or loaves ; set in a warm place to rise 
again, and bake in a quick oven. Do not forget a 
teaspoonful of salt and one of yeast powders sifted 
in the dry flour that you wofk into the batter in the 
morning ; a tin bucket is best, with a tight cover, 
and a towel between it and bucket. If your flour 
is good, there is no better receipt than this; no hops 
are needed. 

Homemade Bread. — Save a gill of bread dough 
made with hop yeast, cover it tightly and place it 
in a cool room or cellar until baking day; then 
make a sponge of it by adding warm water and 
flour, and a good teaspoonful of sugar. This should 
be done early in the morning. When the sponge 
is very light, mix the bread as usual with warm 
milk, or water, and a teaspoonful of soda or saler- 
atus, and when light, bake This always insures 



,M2 BREAD, RISCUIT, CAKES AND YEAST. 

Jiglit, sweet bread, and entirely does away with 
yeast making. Of course, a piece of dough must 
be saved out each time. 

Premium Rye Bread. — One quart of Indian 
meal, one quart of rye meal, one quart of wheat 
flour, one teacup of yeast, one teaspoon of salt. 
Make a thick batter with warm milk ; pour into 
pans and let it rise. Bake until well done. 

Rice Bread. — Boil half a pound of rice in three 
pints of water till the whole becomes thick and 
pulpy. With this, and yeast, and six pounds of 
flour, make your dough. In this way, it is said, as 
much bread will be made as if eight pounds of flour, 
without rice, had been used. 

Corn Bread. — One quart of sour milk, one 
tablespoonful of soda, one teaspoonful of salt, one 
cup of molasses or brown sugar, three large cups 
of corn meal, and three of flour. Mix well, and 
bake in a slow oven at least two hours. 

Brown Bread. — One quart of corn meal, wet 
thoroughly with boiling water ; then add one quart 
of lukewarm water, one quart of raw corn meal, 
one quart of Graham flour, one tablespoonful of 
salt, four tablespoonfuls of good hop yeast, one tea- 
cupful of molasses ; mix thoroughly; when light, 
bake two hours in a moderately heated oven. 

Light Corn Bread. — One quart of boiled milk 
poured over one pint of corn meal, salt, three well 
beaten eggs, four tablespoonfuls of flour, half a 



BREAD, BISCUIT, CAKES AND YEAST. 313 

spoonful of soda, one of cream of tartar, and a little 
butter.. 

Corn Meal Bread. — Beat two eggs very light 
and mix thera with one pint of sour milk ; add a 
teaspoonful of soda, and stir in one pint of corn 
meal and one tablespoonful of melted butter. Beat 
it well, and bake in a quick oven. 

Graham Loaf. — Take one quart of warm water, 
one teacupful of good yeast, and one tablespoonful 
of salt. Put into a pan, make a stiff batter w ith 
flour, which has been sifted, and keep it very warm 
until it is light; then take flour, which has been 
half sifted, to thicken it, knead it well, but do not 
let it get cold; let it rise again. Then work it 
down, and put in one teacupful of sugar and a piece 
of butter the size of an egg. Knead it half an hour, 
put it in pans, and let it rise very light. Bake 
three-quarters of an hour in a moderate oven. 

Graham Biscuit. — Two pints of buttermilk, 
half a pound of butter or lard, one teaspoonful of 
finely pulverized soda in the flour ; flour of desired 
quantity. 

Graham Crackers. — To flour sufficient to 
make a batter add two pints of cold water, quarter 
of a pound of butter, quarter of a teaspoonful of 
soda ; mix as stiff as can be worked. Cut out, pick 
with a fork, bake in a moderately hot oven. These 
crackers, with a cup of sweet cream, make a very 
light, wholesome meal for dyspeptics.

% 

Graham Bread. — Graham flour. Tlie wheat 
imi.vt be of the best quality, and either run through 
a ginut-inill, or washed and dried before grinding. 
It should be ground rather coarser than common 
flour, and used without bolting. It takes more 
wetting than fine flour. For every loaf allow three 
large tablespoonfuls of molasses, one quart of wet- 
ting, a teaspoortful of salt, three teaspoonfuls of 
brewer's yeast. Mix the yeast, molasses, and salt 
in the wetting, add a half teaspoonful of soda, and 
mix in as much coarse flour as can possibly be 
stirred in with a spoon. Now knead the bread 
briskly, until it cleaves from the hand. Put the 
loaves in the pan, and pat it in place and shape. 
If made with homemade yeast, sponge the bread, 
and add the molasses and other wetting after the 
sponge rises. Knead until the dough cleaves from 
the hands ; set it in a warm place until it rises. 
When light, knead it again as before, and put it into 
the pans to rise. Add no flour after the first mix- 
ing ; the dough will not be stifi^ enough to form into 
loaves. Shape the loaves after they are in the pan 
with the hand. 

Italian Bread. — One pound of butter, one 
pound of powdered loaf sugar, one pound two ounces 
of flour, twelve eggs, half a pound of citron and 
lemon-peel. Mix as for pound cake. If the mix- 
ture begins to curdle, which it is most likely to do 
from the quantity of eggs, add a little of the flour. 
When the eggs are all used, and it is light, stir in 



BREAD, BISCUIT, CAKES AND YEAST. 315 

the remainder of the flour lightly. Bake it in long 
narrow tins, either papered or buttered, first put in 
a layer of the mixture, and cover it with the peel, 
cut in large thin slices. Proceed in this way until 
it is three parts full, and bake it in a moderate oven. 

Potato Bread. — There are many ways in which 
potato bread may be made, the most generally prac- 
ticed being to add hot mashed potatoes with wheat 
flour ; but potato bread proper is prepared by mak- 
ing use of potato meal and mashed potatoes only, 
adding one-fifth the quantity of water, with yeast 
and salt as for ordinary bread. This composition 
also makes excellent crumpets. A little butter in- 
troduced, and milk used instead of water, is a ma- 
terial improvement to potato bread. 

Indian Corn Bread. — One cup of sour milk, 
one cup of sweet milk, half a cup of lard, half a cup 
of molasses, one cup of wheat flour, four cups of 
Indian meal, one teaspoonful of saleratus, one tea- 
epoonful of salt. Steam it three hours. 

Scotch SeoRTBREAD.^-Take half a pound of 
fresh butter, one pound of flour, quarter of a pound 
of finely pounded loaf sugar ; work the butter into 
the sugar by degrees, then add the flour in small 
quantities. Knead it with the hand into either a 
rfjund or square tin about an inch thick. Prick all 
over with a fork, and mark neatly round the edges, 
and bake in rather a cool oven for half an hour. 

Common Corn Bread. — One pint of sifted corn 



316 BREAD, BISCUIT, CAKES AND YEAST. 

meal, a pinch of salt, two tablespoonfuls of butter, 
and a quarter of a cup of cream, two eggs. Add 
milk till it is a thin batter. Bake in deep tin pans. 
Or: A pint of sifted meal, one egg, a teaspoonful 
of soda, and a heaped one of cream of tartar, a little 
salt, a bit of butter half the size of an egg, and the 
same of lard ; thin this with milk, so that it will 
pour quite freely. Bake just twenty minutes. 

Genuine Scottish Shortbread. — Take two 
pounds fine flour, one pound fresh butter, half pound 
fine sifted sugar. Thoroughly knead these together 
without one drop of water (the prevailing mistake 
is to add more or less water), roll out the cake to 
half an inch in thickness, and place it over paper in 
a shallow tin, and fire slowly until of proper crisp- 
ness. It is usual to insert in upper surface a few 
caraway confections and small pieces of orange-peel. 
Good cake should be most brittle — Scotice, "short," 
— hence its name. 

Shortbread. — One pound of flour, half a pound 
of fresh butter, three ounces of powdered lump sugar. 
Thoroughly mix the flour and sugar. Place your 
butter in the middle of the pasteboard, and j)ile 
round it the mixed flour and sugar, which you must 
gradually and thoroughly work into the butter. 
When you have worked it smooth, roll it out. Cut 
in the form you wish, pinch round the edges, and 
put some caraway comfits or citron on the top. Bake 
in a very slow oven. 



BREAD, BISCUIT, CAKES AND YEAST. 317 

Dinner Rolls. — One pound of flour, a quarter 
of a pound of butter, one tablespoonful of good yeast, 
one egg, a little warm milk. Rub the butter into 
the flour, then add the yeast, breaking in one egg. 
Mix in with a little warm milk poured into the 
middle of the flour ; stir all well together, and set 
it by the firo to rise ; then make it into light dough, 
and again set it by the fire. Make up the rolls, lay 
them on a tin, and set them in front of the fire for 
ten minutes before you put them into the oven, 
brushing them over with egg. 

French Rolls. — Work one pound of butter 
into a pound of flour ; put to it one beaten egg, two 
tablespoonfuls of yeast, one teaspoonful of salt, and 
as much warm milk as will make a soft dough ; 
strew flour over it ; cover it with a cloth and set it 
in a warm place for an hour or more, until light ; 
flour your hands well ; make it in small rolls ; bake 
in a quick oven. 

Pennsylvania Rusk. — Two pounds of flour, 
one pint of good new milk, two spoonfuls of good 
yeast ; set the sponge to rise over night. Early in 
the morning add a little salt, two large spoonfuls of 
pulverized white sugar (brown will answer), three 
large spoonfuls of butter, two well-beaten eggs, and 
half a nutmeg ; add flour until it is the consistency 
of bread. Knead it well for fifteen or twenty min- 
utes ; set it to rise again. When it has risen mould 
ilj,9i}t, into cakes about the size of a small hen i egg ; 



318 BREAD, BISCUIT, CAKES AND YEAST. 

place them in a large iron pan a little distance apart; 
set them to rise. When they are well raised, beat 
the white of an egg with a little sugar, and brush 
them over the top. Bake them fifteen or twenty- 
minutes, not longer. If you do not have the very 
nicest of rusks after trying this receipt, you must try 
it over again, as it will certainly be your own fault. 

Tea Rusks. — Haifa pint of new milk, and one 
cup of hop yeast ; add flour to make a batter, and 
set the sponge at night. In the morning add half 
a pint of milk, one cup of sugar, one of butter, one 
egg, one nutmeg, and flour to make it sufficiently 
stiffi Let it rise, then roll it, and cut it out ; let it 
rise again, and then bake. 

Rusk. — One pint of milk, one teacupful of butter, 
one cup of sugar, one cup of yeast ; mix stifi*, and 
set in a warm place to rise three hours. 

Light Biscuits. — Put half a pound of butter 
into a basin and turn it about well with a spoon. 
Whisk six eggs well, add half a pound of powdered 
sugar, whisk another ten minutes, and then mix 
with the butter, after which stir in six ounces of cur- 
ranis, and an equal quantity of dried flour. After 
mixing these all well together, drop the mixture on 
paper, each about the size of a shilling, and bake in 
a quick oven, taking the biscuits off the paper while 
hot. 

Biscuits. — Take some of the bread dough in the 



BEEAD, BISCUIT, CAKES AND YEAST. 319 

morning, as much as would make a loaf of bread 
and add one cup of butter; mix well, let it rise^ 
and then make into biscuit. Let it rise again, and 
then bake. 

Butter Biscuits. — Dissolve half a pound of 
butter in half a pint of warm milk, and with four 
pounds of flour make up a smooth, stiif paste ; roll 
it out very thin, and cut with a tin or the top of a 
tumbler into shape ; prick the biscuits over with 
a fork, and bake on tins in a quick oven. 

Biscuit Cakes. — One pound of flour, five eggs, 
beaten and strained, eight ounces of sugar, a little 
rose or orange flower water; beat the whole well 
together, and bake it one hour. 

Cream Biscuits. — Rub one pound of fresh butter 
into one pound of flour, make a hole in the centre, 
into which put half a pound of powdered sugar, 
upon which the rind of a lemon was rubbed pre- 
viously to pounding, and three whole eggs. Mix 
the eggs well with the sugar, and then mix all to- 
gether, forming a flexible paste. Cut it into round 
pieces, each nearly as large as a walnut, stamp them 
flat with a butter stamp of the size of a half dollar, 
and bake them in a slack oven. 

German Cream Biscuits. — Take four ounces 
of butter, six ounces of powdered loaf sugar, seven 
ounces of flour, one tablespoonful of fresh cream, 
and one egg. Make the above into a dough, beat- 
ing it well ; then roll it out very thin, cutting it 
21

into square pieces two inches long and one broad 
Bake in a quick oven, and when done, they should 
be of a light yellow brown. 

Sour Cream Biscuit. — Sift a teaspoonful of salt 
and one of soda with a quart of flour in the bread- 
pan. Have ready a large pint of sour cream, beat 
one egg, add it to the cream, mix, roll, cut, and

sugar, powdered. Rub the dry things well to- 
gether, then quickly mix in, fii'st the cream and 
then the egg. Bake quickly in buttered tins. If

Hints for Making and Baking Sweet 
Cakes. — Eggs should always be broken into a cup, 
the whites and yelks separated, and they should 
always be strained. Breaking the eggs thus, the 
bad ones may be easily rejected without spoiling 



BREAD, BISCUIT, CAKES AND YEAST. 331 

the others, and so cause no waste. As eggs are 
used instead of yeast, they should be very thor- 
oughly whisked ; they are generally sufficiently 
beaten when thick enough to carry the drop that 
falls from the whisk. 

Loaf sug^r should be well pounded, then sifted 
through a fine sieve. 

Currants should be nicely washed, picked, dried 
in a cloth, and then carefully examined, that no 
pieces of grit or stone may be left amongst them. 
They should then be laid on a dish before the fire, 
to become thoroughly dry ; as, if added to the other 
damp ingredients, cakes will be liable to be heavy. 

Good butter should always be used in the manu- 
facture of cakes ; and if beaten to a cream, it saves 
much time and labor to warm, but not melt, it 
before beating. 

Less butter and eggs are required for cakes when 
yeast is mixed with the other ingredients. 

The heat of the oven is of great importance, 
especially for large cakes. If the heat be not 
tolerably fierce, the butter will not rise. If the oven 
is too quick, and there is any danger of the cake 
burning or catching, put a sheet of clean paper over 
the top. Newspaper, or paper that has been printed 
on, should never be used for this purpose. 

To know when a cake is sufficiently baked, plunge 
a clean knife into the middle of it; draw it quickly 
out, and if it looks in the least sticky, put the cake 
back, and close the oven door until the cake ib done.

These proportions allow for the cake being iced. 
If more sugar is preferred, the quantity must be the 
same as the butter ; but less is used in this instance, 
that the cake may be light, and also to allow for the 
fruit, which would make it too sweet. Double the 
quantity of almonds may be used if required, as 
some persons prefer more. Warm a smooth pan, 
large enough for the mixture ; put in the butter, 
and reduce it to a fine cream, by working it about the 
pan with your hand. In summer the pan need not 
be warmed, as it can be reduced to a cream without; 
but in winter keep the mixture as warm as possible, 
without oiling the butter. Add the sugar and mix 
it well with butter, until it becomes white and feels 
iight in the hand. Break in two or three eggs at a 
time, and work the mixture well, before any more 
is added. Continue doing this until they are all 
used and it becomes light ; then add the spirit, cur- 



BREAD, BISCUIT, CAKES AxVD YEAST. 333 

rants, peel, spice, and almonds, some or most of 
these being previously cut in thin slices, the peel 
having also been cut into small thin strips and bits. 
When these are incorporated, mix in the flour 
lightly ; put it in a hoop with paper over the bottom 
and round the sides, and place on a baking-plate. 
Large cakes require three or four pieces of stiff 
paper round the sides ; and if the cake is very large, 
a pipe or funnel, made either of stiff paper or tin, 
and well buttered, should be put in the centre, and 
the mixture placed round it; this is to allow the 
middle of the cake to be well baked, otherwise the 
edge would be burnt two or three inches deep before 
it could be properly done. Place the tin plate con- 
taining the cake on another, the surface of which 
is covered an inch or two thick with sawdust or fine 
ashes to protect the bottom. Bake it in an oven at 
a moderate heat. The time required to bake it will 
depend on the state of the oven and the size of the 
cake. A large cake in an oven of a proper heat will 
take from four to five hours. When the cake is cold, 
proceed to ice it. Wedding cakes have generally, 
first, a coating on the to]) of almond icing ; when 
this is dry, the sides and top are covered with royal 
or white icing. Fix on any gum p^ste or other or- 
naments whilst it is wet ; and when dry, ornament it 
with piping, orange-blossoms, ribbon, etc. ; the sur- 
face and sides are often covered with small knobs of 
white sugar candy whilst the icing is wet. Twelfth 
cakes are iced with white or colored icing, and 



334 BREAD, BISCUIT, CAKES AND YEAST. 

decorated with gum paste, plaster ornaments, piping- 
paste, rings, knots, and fancy pajjcrs, etc., and 
piped. 

Rock Cakes. — A pound of currants cleaned 
and dried, the same quantity of flour well dried, 
hulf a pound of powdered sugar, half a. pound of 
butter, the yelks of eight eggs and the whites of six. 
Mix the whole well together, having first beaten the 
batter to a cream ; drop the paste in small quanti- 
ties on buttered paper, and bake on tins in a quick 
oven. 

Love Cakes. — Three eggs, five ounces of sugar, 
six ounces of flour, salt, mace, or rose water, to be 
dropped, and sugar sprinkled on before baking. 

In cake making every article employed therein 
should be ready one hour previous to their being 
wanted, and should be placed before the fire or upon 
a stove, that they may become gently heated, with- 
out which no good cakes can be produced. 

Cakes keep best in tin canisters; wooden boxes, 
unless well seasoned, are apt to give them a dis- 
agreeable taste ; brown paper should be avoided for 
the same reason.

bottled, it should be kept in a cool place. 

Potato Yeast. — For those who live far from 
shops this receipt may sometimes be found useful in

case of deficiency. Boil mealy potatoes, peel them, 
mash them very smooth, and put to them as much 
hot water as will make them the consistence of yeast, 
no thicker. Add for every pound of potatoes two 
ounces of very coarse sugar or treacle, and while the 
mixture is warm, stir in two spoonfuls of yeast. 
Keep it warm until it rises well. It may be used 
in twenty-four hours. One pound of potatoes will 
make nearly a quart of yeast. 

Homemade Yeast. — Put one pint of dry hops 
into three pints of water to boil. Peel eight pota- 
toes and put them on in a separate pan to boil. 
When the potatoes are done, the hop tea will be the 
right strength. Strain the tea from the hops and 
set it to cool. Mash the potatoes free from lumps, 
add one pint of flour, one teaspoonful of salt, and 
one tablespoonful of sugar (brown). Pour the tea 
over this mixture, stir well together, add one cup 
of yeast, baker's will do, though I always have 
enough of my old yeast to set new with. Let it rise 
in a large open vessel in a warm place, stir occa- 
sionally, and when it is well risen, and begins to 
fe,ll in the centre, put in a close jug and cork tight. 

Sweetened Yeast. — Boil and masli ten pota- 
toes of nearly equal size. Pour on them one quart 
of boiling water, and stir in one coffeecup of good 
sugar. After standing a few minutes, add another 
quart of hot water, less one gill. When lukewarm, 
add one pint of yeast, and set it in a moderately

warm place to rise. When it gets light, set it down 
cellar for future use. 

Hops and Potato Yeast. — In two quarts of 
water boil six potatoes, pared and cut up, and a 
handful of hops (in a bag). Boil till the potatoes 
are done, then take all out. Mash the potatoes up 
and put them back into tlie water with one cup of 
salt and one cup of white sugar. Let it come to a 
boil, then cool off, and when milk warm, add about 
one cup of baker's yeast. Set it in a warm place to 
rise, then jug it up tight, put it in a cool place, and 
it would keep for six months.

To Make Good Tea. — In making tea it is usual 
to allow a teaspoonful of dry tea for each person. 
First scald the teapot by filling it with boiling watery 
and letting it stand a few minutes near the fire. 
Turn ofi* the water and put in the dry tea ; over this 
pour boiling water enough to cover it. Cover the 
teapot closely, and stand near the fire for five min- 
utes. Fill up with boiling water, and serve. 

To Make Good Chocolate. — Grate one cake 
of fine French chocolate, and put it over the fire 
with lukewarm water enough to cover it. Stir 
gently until thoroughly dissolved. Pour in gradu- 
ally, stirring all the time, half a pint of boiling milk. 
Boil all gently for five minutes, and serve. 

Chocolate a la Francaise. — Grate one cake 
of fine French chocolate into a gill of cold milk. 
Put into a vessel of boiling water, and stir till well 
mixed. Add half a pint of milk and water, cold, 
and let it gradually come to a boil, stirring all the 
time. Boil fifteen minutes.

Cocoa Shells. — Soak a teacupful of dry shells 
all night in a quart of cold water ; boil in the same 
water three hours before using. (Prepared shells do 
not require soaking.) Boil them rapidly for one 
hour, settle and strain, and add boiling milk in the 
proportion of a pint of milk to a quart of water and 
three ounces of shells. 

Broma. — To make broraa, powder in a mortar, 
two ounces of arrowroot, half a pound of loaf sugar, 
and a pound of pure chocolate. Sift carefully through 
a hair sieve. To two tablespoonfiils of this powder 
put two tablespoonfuls of cream. Stir till well 
mixed, pour on half a pint of boiling milk, and boil 
all for ten minutes. 

coffee and its preparation. 
It is not our intention to go into detailed history 
of the cultivation of the coffee plant, which is not 
likely to be of great interest to our readers. Prac- 
tically it is sufficient for us to know that coffee is 
largely cultivated in many of the tropical regions of 
the globe, as the West Indies and America, Arabia, 
Ceylon, India, Bourbon, Java, etc. The Arabian or 
Mocha bean is very small, round, and dark yellow 
in color; East Indian kinds are larger; and the 
Ceylon, AVest Indian and Brazilian kinds are of a 
bluish or greenish-gray tint, and the largest in size. 
When coffee-berries are roasted, they suffer some re- 
markable changes, losing considerably in weight, 
but increasing to nearly double their original size ; 



BEVERAGES. 381 

during the roasting the aromatic flavor is developed, 
but the exact nature of the changes undergone is 
not clearly understood. It is remarkable that coffee 
contains a peculiar substance called caifein, on which 
much of the use of coffee as a beverage depends. 

Roasted coffee when ground is much adulterated 
with chicory ; this fraud is easily detected by drop- 
ping some of the suspected coffee in a wineglass 
with cold water. If the coffee is pure, it swims on 
the surface, and scarcely colors the water ; if it con- 
tains chicory, the latter sinks to the bottom and 
stains the water of a deep red tint. 

Coffee is a wholesome and nutritive beverage ; it 
diminishes the disposition to sleep, and hence it is 
used by those who require to keep awake for study 
or other purposes. Medicinally it is found, like tea, 
useful in some forms of headache, where there is 
not any determination of blood to the head ; and it 
is also especially useful in some cases of spasmodic 
asthma, when taken strong. 

The making of good coffee is a very rare thing in 
this country. Most persons boil it, so making a de- 
coction instead of an infusion ; this effectually gets 
rid of the delicate and agreeable aromatic flavor, 
and leaves a comparatively tasteless beverage. The 
following ])articulars will be found worth attention ; 
never buy your coffee ground, but grind it yourself 
immediately before using it; keep your coffee-pot, 
whatever kind you may use, wiped clean and dry 
inside, a damp tea or coffee-pot acquires a musty 



382 BEVERAGES. 

flavor tliat spoils the best tea or coffee. The cheap- 
est, and perhaps the best coffee-pots, are those made 
on the French plan, called cafeti^res ; if you have 
not one of these, adopt the following plan : put 
your freshly-ground coffee into the coffee-pot, pre- 
viously made warm, and pour upon it water actually 
boiling, set the pot by the side of the fire for a few 
seconds, but do not let it boil up, then pour a cupful 
out and return it back again to the pot, in order to 
clear it ; having done this, let it stand on the hob or 
fender to settle, and, in less than five minutes, a 
transparent strong aromatic cup of coffee may be 
poured out. The proportions of coffee (which should 
not be too finely ground) recommended, are an ounce 
to a pint, or pint and a half of water. 

The milk used with coffee should always be boiled 
and used as hot as possible ; the boiling of milk 
imparts a peculiar and exceedingly pleasant flavor to 
the coffee. White sugar is recommended, as the 
treacle-like flavor of moist sugar quite overpowers 
the delicate aroma. 

Cafe au Lait. — The French are justly cele- 
brated for this breakfast coffee, which may be made 
as follows : Use an infusion, made as directed, or in 
a cafetilre, only of double the strength, and when 
clear, pour it into the breakfast cups, which have 
been previously half or three-quarters filled with 
boiling milk, sweetened with loaf sugar. 

Cafb Noir. — The strong, clear, black infusion, 



BEVERA.GES, 383 

ma<Te as above, served in small cups, and drank 
with a large quantity of sugar, is the caf^ noir of 
the French. 

Having been great coffee drinkers in our time, 
we have tried nearly every machine for making 
coffee that has ever been invented. These contri- 
vances, though very immerous, may be arranged in 
two classes — such as boil the coffee or make a de- 
coction, and those that expose it to the action of 
boiling water, or form an infusion. In the first 
class is included the common pot, which is too well 
known to need description. The ground coffee is 
boiled in the water, and the liquid fined by pour- 
ing out a portion and returning it. As the flavor 
of coffee depends on a very volatile oil, which is 
entirely dissipated by boiling, it is evident that cof- 
fee preserving its delicate aroma cannot be prepared 
by this process. 

The full flavor of coffee can be extracted by in- 
fusion, as effected in those contrivances in which 
the boiling water is poured on the ground berries. 
Of these we have found none superior to the French 
cafeti^re, which has the advantage of being cheap, 
simple, not liable to get out of order, and easily 
cleaned and dried. After trying nearly every de- 
vice that has been promulgated, we have returned 
to our first love, the eafetikre, and hardly think we 
shall again be seduced from our attachment to it. 
Above all, we caution our readers to abstain from' 
all coffee-making contrivances which contain a 
25 



384 BRVERAGES. 

Btrainer made of linen, calico, or any vegetable 
fabric, as these, being moistened day after day, and 
kept constantly wet, become mouldy, and impart a 
very bad taste to the beverage. 

In the absence of any other contrivance, coffee as 
good as ever was imbibed can be made in a lipped 
jug by the following directions : Pour some boiling 
water in your jug to heat it, throw this out, put in 
your ground coffee, pour on your boiling water, stir 
down the powder from the top with a spoon, cover 
over the jug with a folded napkin, and place on the 
hob for a few minutes ; then pour out steadily, and 
you will have as clear and bright a cup of coffee as 
ever was made. As for the kind of coffee to be 
recommended, we always prefer a mixture of one- 
third small pea-berried Mocha, with two-thirds 
plantation coffee. This gives flavor and body, and 
we always add an ounce of good ground chicory to 
every pound. Dear readers, try this mixture; make 
it strong — very strong — pour it into large breakfast 
cups, with an equal amount of boiling milk, sweeten 
with loaf sugar, and then you may laugh at those 
who say that good coffee is only to be drunk in 
France. 

Good Coffee. — Put a cupful of coffee into a 
coffee-pot, break in an egg, pour .'ibout a quart of 
hot water on it, boil an hour, strain through muslin, 
and serve up very hot. 

Another method. — Never puicliase ooffue 



BEVEEAGES. 385 

ground, but always whole ; and, above all, desire 
the servant to be most careful that the coifee-pot 
be thoroughly clean and well dried, so that it may 
be quite free from all unpleasant smell of stale cof- 
fee, which Avill entirely spoil the flavor of the fresh. 
After having ground a sufficient quantity of berries 
to allow one tablespoonfnl for each person, the 
white and shell of one egg must be thoroughly 
stirred about and mixed in with the coffee. After 
this, pour upon it as much boiling water as it is 
supposed will be required, and boil it up as quickly 
as possible. Pour out about a teacupful, and put it 
back again. Take it from the fire, and pour half a 
teacup of quite cold water into it, and let it stand 
five minutes by the fire (but do not let it boil 
again) before you transfer it to the coffee-pot it is 
to be sent up in. Be very careful not to shake it 
in doing this, as the egg-shell and coffee powder 
will have settled at the bottom, and the liquid ought 
to be perfectly clear, and of a dark golden brown 
color. 

Concentrated Coffee. — Procure one-half 
pound of the choicest roasted coffee berries you can 
command, let the same be ground under your own 
immediate eye, to prevent the opportunity of chi- 
cory or any other spurious drug being introduced 
among the genuine material. Submit the coffee to 
a clean saucepan, containing one quart of boiling 
water, stir it round twice or thrice with a suitably- 



38 6 BEVERAGES. 

sized spoon, adding, at the same time, two pieces 
of fresh white ginger. Place the saucepan over a 
slow fire, and let it simmer until the quantity of 
liquor is reduced to one pint; then strain the latter 
off into a smaller saucepan, and allow the liquor to 
simmer gently, adding to it at intervals as much 
white sugar as will qualify the character of a thick 
consistent syrup, when it may be taken up, and 
when thoroughly cold poured into jars or bottles, 
stopped closely down for use. It will keep for any 
length of time in any climate. An individual, 
possessing the above confection, may command a 
cup of strong, genuine coffee at a minute's notice ; 
it is necessary only to introduce two or three tea- 
spoonfuls of the essence into a coffeecup, and fill 
with boiling water. 

FEUIT SYEUPS. 

Most of our readers are aware that there are two 
different classes of sugars, — the cane sugars, derived 
from the cane, the beet, etc., and tiie gra})e sugars, 
as found in the grape, in honey, and as prepared 
artificially from potatoes; the latter used princi- 
pally in the fabrication of wines. Both forms of 
sugar have much the same taste, and cannot be dis- 
tinguished readily in solution. Of the cane sugars, 
however, only half the quantity is required to pro- 
duce a given sweetening effect as of the other. It 
may not be known generally, however, that cane 
sugar by long boiling becomes changed into grape 



BEVERAGES. 387 

sugar, and thus loses a portion of its sweetening 
power. This takes place not only in the process of 
clarifying, but also in preparing fruits, syrups, and 
preserves. Should the syrups be thickened by boil- 
ing beyond a certain degree, the grape sugar pro- 
duced, being only about one-quarter as soluble as 
cane sugar, separates after a time in the form of 
white crystals, the comparative want of sweetness in 
which will be very evident to the taste. Mixed 
with water as a drink, twice as much will be required 
as if no change had occurred. This furnishes a use- 
ful hint to housekeepers, which has been acted on to 
great advantage, namely, to boil the fruit juice by 
itself for the proper time, and allow it to become 
lukewarm, adding the proper quantity of white 
sugar, which soon dissolves without further heating. 
The juice is preserved in this way as perfectly as if 
the sugar were boiled a long time with it, maintains 
its original sweetness without the formation of crys- 
tals, and a much less quantity will answer the pur- 
pose. The same theory is applicable in the prepa- 
ration of preserves as of syrups. 

It is to be' regretted that fruit syrups are not more 
extensively used in this country, as the addition of 
a few tablespoonfuls of a good fruit syrup to a glass 
of iced water, or soda water, produces a refreshing 
summer beverage that is far more desirable for 
general use than the majority of the liquids em- 
ployed in this country. For the use of ladies and 
children, and all persons by whom intoxicating bev- 



388 BEVERAGES. 

erages are not used, they are strongly to be com- 
mended. 

Currant Syrup. — One pint of juice, two pounds 
of sugar. Mix together three pounds of currants, 
half white and half red, one pound of raspberries, 
and one pound of cherries, without the stones. Mash 
the fruit, and let it stand in a warm place for three 
or four days, keeping it covered with a coarse cloth 
or piece of paper with holes pricked in it to keep 
out any dust or dirt. Filter the juice, add the sugar 
in powder, finish in the Avater-bath, and skim it. 
When cold, put it into bottles, fill them, and cork 
well. 

MoRELLO Cherry Syrup. — Take the stones out 
of the cherries, mash them, and press out the juice 
in an earthen pan. Let it stand in a cool place for 
two days, then filter; add two pounds of sugar to 
one pint of juice, finish in the water-bath, or stir it 
well on the fire, and give it one or two boils. 

Mulberry Syrup. — One pint of juice, one 
pound twelve ounces of sugar. Press out the juice, 
and finish as cherry syrup. 

Gooseberry Syrup. — One pint of juice, one 
pound twelve ounces of sugar. To twelve pounds 
of ripe gooseberries add two pounds of cherries 
without stones, squeeze out the juice, and finish as 
others. 

Lemon Syrup. — One pint and a quarter of juice, 
two pounds of sugar. Let the juice stand in a cool 



BEVERAGES. 389 

place to settle. When a thin skin is formed on the 
top pour it off and filter ; add the sugar, and finish 
in the water-bath. If the flavor of the peel is pre- 
ferred with it, grate off tlie yellow rind of the lem- 
ons and mix it with the juice to infuse, or rub it off 
on part of the sugar, and add it with the remainder 
when you finish it. 

Raspberry Vinegar Syrup. — One pint of 
juice, two pints of vinegar, four pounds and a half 
of sugar. Prepare the juice as before, adding the 
vinegar with it. Strain the juice and boil to the 
pearl. A very superior raspberry vinegar is made 
by taking three pounds of raspberries, two pints of 
vinegar, and three pounds of sugar. Put the rasp- 
berries into the vinegar without mashing them, cover 
the pan close, and let it remain in a cellar for seven 
or eight days ; then filter the infusion, add the sugar 
in powder, and finish in the water-bath. This is 
superior to the first, as the beautiful aroma of the 
fruit is not lost in the boiling. 

Sour Orange Syrup.— Peel the oranges care- 
fully, then squeeze the juice and strain it, so as to 
extract the seed and white fibrous substances, which 
are very bitter. Add one pound of loaf sugar to 
one pint of juice, and boil it in a pi-eserving kettle. 
Stir frequently, and skim well. Boil until it is a 
rich syrup. When nearly cold, bottle, cork, and 
seal. 

Syrup of Cloves. — Put a quarter of a pound 



390 BEVERAGES. 

of cloves to a quart of boiling water, cover close, set 
it over a fire, and boil gently half an hour ; then 
drain and add to a pint of the liquor two pounds of 
loaf sugar, clear it with the whites of two eggs, 
beaten up with cold water, and let it simmer till 
it is strong syrup. Preserve it in phials, close 
corked. 

Orange Syrup. — Select ripe and thin-skinned 
fruit. Squeeze the juice through a sieve, and to 
every pint add one pound and a half of loaf sugar. 
Boil it slowly, and skim as long as the scum rises ; 
then take it off, let it grow cold, and bottle it. Two 
tablespoonfuls of this syrup mixed with melted but- 
ter make a nice sauce for plum or batter puddings. 
Three tablespoonfuls of it in a glass of ice water 
make a delicious beverage. 

Lemonades. — Lemons furnish two important 
products for the formation of beverages, an acid 
juice, and an aromatic stomachic oil, contained in 
the rind. Lemon juice is a slightly turbid, very 
sour liquid, having a pleasant flavor when diluted. 
It contains a considerable quantity of gummy mu- 
cilage, which causes it to become mouldy on expo- 
sure to the air. It is capable of furnishing a large 
number of acidulated drinks, which are exceedingly 
useful in allaying thirst, and are most valuable for 
their anti-scorbutic properties. 

In making any kind of lemonade, the proportions 
given need not be adhered to, bat the quantities 



BEVERAGES. 391 

ordered may I)e increased or lessened to suit the 
taste. 

For a quart of lemonade, take six lemons and a 
quarter of a pound of sugar ; rub oif part of the yel- 
low rind of the lemons on to the sugar, squeeze the 
juice on to the latter, and pour on the water boiling 
hot ; mix the whole, and run through a flannel 
jelly-bag. 

Lemons are not always to be procured, especially 
on a journey, and we have, therefore, much pleasure 
in drawing attention to the following useful direc- 
tions for making portable lemonade : — 

Excellent Portable Lemonade. — Rasp with 
a quarter of a pound of sugar, the rind of a fine 
juicy lemon ; reduce the sugar to powder, and pour 
on it the strained juice of the fruit ; press the mix- 
ture into a jar, and when wanted for use dissolve a 
tablespoonful of it in a glass of water ; it will keep 
a considerable time. If too sweet for the taste of 
the drinker, a very small portion of citric acid may 
be added when it is taken. 

Mock Lemonade. — A cheap substitute for 
lemonade may be made as follows : Tartaric acid, a 
quarter of an ounce; sugar, six ounces ; essence of 
lemon, dropped on the sugar, about four or five 
drops ; boiling water, two pints. This, allowed to 
stand till cold, makes a wholesome, cooling, summer 
beverage, economical in its cost, but the flavor is not 
equal to that prepared from lemon juice. 



392 BEVERAGES. 

Superior Lemox a la Soyer. — Take the peel 
of six lemons, free from pith, cut it up in small 
pieces, and put it with two cloves into a bottle con- 
taining half a pint of hot water, place the bottle in 
a stewpau with boiling water, and let it stand by the 
side of a fire for one or two hours, taking care it 
does not boil; then take half a pint of lemon juice, 
half a pint of syrup, if none, use plain syrup, or 
sugar, in like proportion, adding a few drops of 
orange flower water; add the infusion of the rind, 
which has been previously made, and allowed to be- 
come cold, stir well together, and add two quarts of 
cold water. 

Lemonade a la Soyer. — Put a quart of water 
in a stewpan to boil, into which put two moi?!t dried 
figs, each split in two ; let it boil a quarter of an 
hour, then have ready the peel of a lemon, taken oflF 
rather thickly, and the half of the lemon cut in thin 
slices ; throw them into the stewpan, and boil two 
minutes longer, then pour it into a jug, which cover 
closely with paper until cold, then pass it through 
a sieve, add a teaspoonful of honey, and it is ready 
for use. 

Orangeade a la Soyer. — Proceed as for 
lemonade, but using the whole of the orange, a little 
of the peel included, sweetening with sugar-candy, 
and adding a teaspoonful of arrowroot, mixed with 
a little cold water, which pour into the boiling liquid 
at the same time you put in the orange. The ar- 
rowroot makes it very delicate. 



BEVERAGES. 393 

Barley Lemonade. — Put a quarter of a pound 
of sugar into a small stewpan, with half a pint of 
"water, which boil, about ten minutes, or until form- 
ing a thickish syrup ; then add the rind of a fresh 
lemon and the pulp of tM'o ; let it boil t^vo minutes 
longer, when add two quarts of barley-water, made 
without sugar and lemon ; boil five minutes longer, 
pass it through a hair sieve into a jug, which cover 
with paper, making a hole in the centre to let the 
heat through ; when cold it is ready for use ; if put 
cold into a bottle, and well corked down, it would 
keep good several days. 

Barley Oeanqeade. — Barley orangeade is 
made in the same manner, substituting the rind and 
juice of oranges; the juice of a lemon, in addition, 
is an improvement. 

Another Mock IjEMONADE. — A mock lemon- 
ade of superior flavor may be made by using the 
acid prepared from lemons, citric acid, according to 
the following receipt : Citric acid, a quarter of an 
ounce ; essence of lemon, ten to twenty drops ; syrup, 
half a pint ; boiling water, as much as may be re- 
quired. This preparation is expensive, and is not 
equal to lemonade from fresh lemons, which should 
always be preferred when they can be obtained. 

Plain Orangeade. — Orangeade should be made 
in precisely a similar manner to lemonade, using 
oranges instead of lemons ; but as there is less acid 
in this fruit, a much larger proportion of juice is 



394 BEVERAGES. 

required, and, however prepared, tliis beverage is 
rather insipid, and is inferior to the following : — 

Orange Lemonade. — Take three oranges, one 
large lemon, and two or three ounces of sugar ; rub 
off some of the peel on to the sugar, squeej^e on tlie 
juice, and pour on two pints of boiling water; mix 
the whole and strain. 

Orangeade. — Take half a pound of ground loaf 
sug)*.r, one and a half ounce of carbonate of soda ; 
mix well in sixteen portions, and put in blue paper; 
one ounce of tartaric acid, in white paper. Dissolve 
the contents of a blue paper in half a pint of water, 
and the acid in a quarter of a pint of water, to which 
add orange juice; mix them together and drink. 
Two or three spoonfuls of the syrup of marmalade 
may be used instead of orange juice, in which case 
it must be dissolved in the first glass. 

FRUIT VINEGARS. 

During the summer few beverages are more 
refreshing than fruit vinegars, mixed with iced or 
cold spring water. The following directions are 
recomended as having been tried and found very 
successful : 

Strawberry Vinegar. — Take the stalks from 
the fruit, which should be a highly flavored sort, 
quite ripe, fresh from the beds, and gathered in dry 
weather ; weigh and put it into large glass jars, or 
wide-necked bottles, and to each pound pour about 



BEVERAGES. 396 

a pint and a half of fine pale white wine vinegar, 
which will answer the purpose better than the en^ 
tirely colorless kind, sold under the name of distilled 
vinegar,' but which is the pyroligneous acid greatly 
diluted. Tie a thick paper over them, and let the 
strawberries remain from three to four days ; then 
pour off the vinegar and empty them into a jelly- 
bag, or suspend them in a cloth that all the liquid 
may drop from them without pressure; take an 
equal weight of fresh fruit, pour the vinegar upon 
it, and three days afterwards repeat the same pro- 
cess, diminishing a little the proportion of straw- 
berries, of which the flavor ought ultimately to 
overpower the vinegar. In three days drain off 
the liquid very closely, and after having strained it 
through a linen or a flannel bag, weigh it, and mix 
with it an equal quantity of highly-refined sugar, 
roughly powdered ; when this is nearl}' dissolved, 
stir the syrup over a very clear fire until it has 
boiled five minutes, and skim it thoroughly ; pour 
it into a delicately clean stone pitcher, or into large 
china jugs, throw a folded cloth over and let it 
remain until the morrow ; put it into pint or half 
pint bottles, and cork them tightly with new velvet 
corks, for if these be pressed in tightly at first, the 
bottles would be liable to burst; in four or five days 
they may be closely corked, and stored in a dry and 
cool place. 

Damp destroys the color and injures the flavor 
of these fine fruit vinegars, of which a spoonful or 



39G BEVERAGES. 

two in a glass of water affords so agreeable a sum- 
mer beverage, and one which, in many cases of 
illness, is so acceptable to invalids. 

Where there is a garden the fruit may be thrown 
into the vinegar as it ripens, within an interval of 
forty-eight hours, instead of being all put to infuse 
at once, and it must then remain a proportionate 
time ; one or two days in addition to that specified 
will make no diiference to the preparation. The 
enamelled stewpans are the best possible vessels to 
boil it in, but it may be simmered in a stone jar set 
into a pan of boiling water, when there is nothing 
more appropriate at hand ; though the syrup does 
not usually keep so well when this last method is 
adopted. 

Raspberry Vinegar. — Put two pounds of 
raspberries into a jar, and pour on them a quart of 
best white wine vinegar, and let all stand twenty- 
four hours ; then add two pounds more of rasp- 
berrries, and let all stand twenty-four hours more ; 
then strain the pure vinegar through a sieve, and 
to every pint add one pound of sugar, and then 
boil it up twenty minutes; when cold, bottle it 
for use. It will keep two years; but seal each 
bottle. 

Gooseberry Vinegar. — Take the ripest goose- 
berries you can get; put tliem into a very clean tub, 
and crush them with your hands. To every peck 
of gooseberries put two gallons of water; mix them 



BEVERAGES. 397 

well together, and let them work for three weeks, 
taking care to stir them up three or four times a 
day. At the expiration of that time, strain the 
liquor through a hair sieve, and to every gallon of 
it, add one pound of moist sugar, one pound of 
treacle, and a spoonful of fresh yeast ; let it work 
for four days in the same tub, which should be 
well washed. Turn it into iron-hooped barrels, 
and let it stand twelve months ; then draw it into 
bottles for use. This far exceeds any white wine 
vinegar. 

Norwegian Raspberry Vinegar. — Take 
four pounds of raspberries, pour over them half a 
pint of vinegar, place it in an earthen jar, and 
cover it securely, so that no air can enter, and place 
it in a sunny window twelve hours ; take it in at 
night, and place it out again in the sun the next 
day for another twelve hours. Then place in a 
flannel bag, till the juice has run through without 
pressure. Then, for every pound of juice take a 
pound of loaf sugar, and boil it for a quarter of an 
hour, or till no scum arises; then put it into small 
bottles and well cork it. 

Mixed Fruit Vinegars. — Raspberries and 
strawberries mixed will make a vinegar of very 
pleasant flavor. 

Strawberry Drink. — Put to a pint of water 
a pound of strawberries, which you are to bruise 
or mash in the water, then put in a quarter of a

pound or five ounces of sugar, aud squeeze into it 
the juice of a lemon, aud suffer it to cool before 
you drink it. If the lemon be full, it will serve 
two pints. 

Lemon Water is also a delightful drink. Put 
two slices of lemon, thinly peeled, into a teapot a 
little bit of the peel and a large spoonful of capil- 
laire; pour in a pint of boiling water, and stop it 
close two hours. 

Tomato Wine. — Take small ripe tomatoes, pick 
off the stems and wash them, mash and strain 
through a linen bag ; let it stand till the pulp is 
settled, then measure. Add two pounds and a half 
or three pounds of loaf sugar to a gallon of juice. 
Put into a cask, and let it ferment, then bottle and 
pack away for use. If two gallons of water are 
added to five gallons of juice, it will make pretty 
good wine, but not as fine as if the adulteration is 
not made. 

Muscadine Wine. — Get the grapes full ripe, 
wash, and pound with a pestle, being careful not to 
break the seeds, as it will make the wine bitter. 
Measure them after they are pounded, and to every 
gallon add a gallon of cistern water. Let it stand 
a week, then measure the clear juice; add two 
pounds and a half or three pounds of loaf sugar 
to each gallon. Let it stand till fermentation 
ceases, then bottle for use. This is excellent — 
try it.

Tla:^BAKiX WiNE. — Take the juice from the 
M»«ilks of the gurJfcU rhubarb, one gallon, to it add 
one gallon o:^ water in which seven pounds of sugar 
has been dissolvtxi; put the mixture into a cask 
with the bung-b.ole open, and let it ferment ; keep 
the cask full by adding sweetened water, so that it 
may purge itself. When it is sufficiently fermented, 
put in the bung. To give it a slight "bouquet 
flavor," three ounces of orris root, well pounded, 
is added to each barrel. Fine with isinglass before 
bottling. Four ounces of isinglass dissolved in a 
pint or more of wine, is sufficient for a barrel of 
wine. 

Ginger Wine. — Take four gallons of water and 
geven pounds of sugar; boil them half an hour, 
skimming it all the time j when the liquor is cold, 
aqueeze in the juice of two lemons; then boil the 
peels, with two ounces of white ginger, in three 
pints of water, one hour ; when cold, put it all to- 
gether into the cask with one gill of finings and 
three pounds of Malaga raisins ; then close it up, 
let it stand two months, then bottle it off. N. B. — 
A lump of unslacked lime put into your cask will 
keep wine from turning sour. 

Lemon Wine. — Mix well together the rind of 
six and the juice of eighteen lemons, one gallon of 
whisky, six quarts of cold water, three pounds of 
loaf sugar, a stick of cinnamon, three dozen cloves, 
two ounces of bitter almonds, and a quarter of a

pound of burnt sugar ; when the sugar Is well dis- 
solved, add three quarts of boiling new milk. Let 
it stand for two hours ; then strain through a flan- 
nel bag until quite clear. This quantity will fill 
eighteen bottles. 

Imperial. — Take half an ounce of cream of 
tartar, three ounces of fresh orange or lemon-peel, 
four ounces of lump sugar, and three pints of 
boiling water. Mix together; cover the vessel 
till cold, then pour off the clear part for use. 
This is a very agreeable drink for hot weather, or 
in fever. 

Imperial. Pop. — Take three ounces of cream of 
tartar, one ounce of ginger, one and a half pound 
of white sugar, the juice of a lemon, and one gal- 
lon of water. Work it with yeast, and bottle it as 
ginger beer, which it resembles, except as being 
more acid in flavor, and more cooling in its medical 
proj)erties. 

Capillaire. — Take one pound of loaf sugar, 
quarter of a pound of moist sugar, one egg well 
beaten, one pint of water. Sinmier it one hour, 
skim it while boiling, let it get cold, then again 
boil and skim, and add one ounce of orange 
flower water and two tablespoonfuls of brandy. 
Strain through a jelly-bag, and bottle for use.

CHAPTER XII. 

INVALID COOKERY, 

Beef-Tea. — Take one and a half pound of the 
best steak, cut it into very small pieces, and put 
them into an earthenware jar with enough cold 
water to cover the meat ; tie the top of the jar on, 
and put it into a saucepan full of hot water ; place 
the saucepan on the fire, and allow it to boil for 
three hours, by which time all the goodness of the 
meat will be extracted. This is the pure essence 
of beef. 

Liebig's Soup. — Mix one tablespoonful of 
wheaten flour with one tablespoonful of freshly- 
ground malt flour, and add seven and a quarter 
grains of the bi-carbonate of potash. Rub this 
mixture well in a basin with two tablespoonfuls of 
water, and gradually add ten tablespoonfuls of new 
milk, stirring till all is well blended. Then simmer 
this mixture over a gentle fire until it begins to 
thicken. Immediately when it begins to thicken, 
remove the saucepan from the fire and stir the soup 
briskly until it becomes fluid. Now place the 
saucepan again over the fire, and let the soup boil 
gently for five minutes. Then strain it through a 
406 



INVALID COOKERY. 407 

fine sieve, so as to clear it from all the bran of the 
malt. No sweetening is required, for the soup 
thus prepared will be sweet as milk. For the flour 
use seconds or common households. The malt 
should be freshly ground for every time of use. 
This may be done in a common coffee-mill. 

Beef-Tea and Baked Flour. — This may be 
prepared exactly like the preceding receipt, only 
using baked flour instead of the arrowroot-powder. 
With this change it becomes a very nutritious food, 
and one meal per diem of such food will be sufficient 
in ordinary circumstances of health. 

Flaxseed Jelly for a Cough. — A coffeecup 
of flaxseed, two quarts of water ; boil several hours 
until reduced to a jelly; strain through a thin cloth, 
squeeze in the pulp and juice of a large lemon ; roll 
a quarter of a pound of best raisins, mix them in 
the jelly, simmer without boiling one hour; strain 
again, add half a teacup of the best loaf sugar. 
Take a tablespoonful every hour. 

Sago. — Like arrowroot, this should be used only 
as an occasional change ; for it is deficient in nutri- 
tive properties. Take one tablespoonful of sago 
and macerate for two hours in one pint of water 
placed at the side of the fire, or in a slow oven. 
Then let it boil gently for a quarter of an hour, and 
before it is taken from the fire, add new milk, a 
little loaf sugar, and a few grains of salt. 

Tapioca. — This is another of the articles which, 



408 INVALID COOKERY. 

though deficient in the elements of nutrition, may oc- 
casionall V supj)ly an agreeable change of diet. Take 
one tablespoonful of tapioca, and macerate for an hour 
in a pint of water, in a pan placed at the side of the 
fire, or in a slow oven. Then let it simmer gently for 
ten minutes, and before taking it from the fire, add 
milk, with a little loaf sugar, and a few grains of salt. 

V "^Oatmeal Porridge is made by boiling oatmeal 
and water in such proportions that a thick mixture 
is obtained, which, on cooling, becomes nearly solid. 
The coarse Scotch oatmeal is far superior for these 
purposes. The most approved method of making 
porridge is to strew oatmeal with one hand into a 
vessel of boiling water (to which salt has been 
previously added), so gradually that it does not 
become lumpy, stirring the mixture at the same 
time with the other hand. After the requisite 
quantity has been stirred in — namely, about two 
large haudfuls of coarse oatmeal to a quart of boiling 
water — the whole should be allowed to stand by the 
side of the fire, so as to simmer gently for twenty 
or thirty minutes. During this time it thickens 
considerably. As thus prepared, it is usually eaten 
with the addition of milk. 

Milk and Oatmeal Gruel. — This is a very 
nutritious food, but its effect should be watched, as 
it may not suit all cases. To prepare it, take a 
tablespoonful of the finest oatmeal and mix smoothly 
with about a quarter of a pint of cold water, while 



INVALID COOKERY. 409 

three-quarters of a pint of new milk is simmered 
Mix the warm milk gradually with the oatmeal and 
water. Then pour all into the saucepan, and boil 
it gently for ten minutes — stirring it well. Add a 
little loaf sugar and a few grains of salt. 

Panada op Fine Flour. — Rub smoothly one 
tablespoonful of the finest biscuit-flour with a 
quarter of a pint of cold water in a basin. Simmer 
three-quarters of a pint of new milk with two or 
three lumps of sugar in it. Mix gradually, the 
milk with the flour and water. Put it into the 
saucepan, and let it simmer gently for twenty 
minutes, stirring it well to prevent burning. This 
is a good food, and will generally be found to l^eep 
the bowels regular. 

Chicken Panada. — Skin a fowl; cut it in 
pieces, leaving the breast whole ; boil it in three 
pints of water till perfectly tender, pick off the meat, 
and pound it finely in a mortar, and mix it with 
the liquor it was boiled in ; rub it through a sieve, 
and season it with salt. 

Baked Crumbs of Bread. — Crumb some 
bread on a plate, put it a little distance from the 
fire to dry ; when dry, rub the crumbs in a mortar, 
and reduce them to a fine powder ; then pass them 
through a sieve. Having done which, put the 
crumbs of bread into a slow oven to bake until they 
be of a light fawn color. A small quantity of this 
baked crumb of bread must be made into food, in 



410 INVALID COOKERY. 

the same way as gruel is made, and sliould then be 
sh'ghtly sweetened with lump sugar. 

Bread Panada. — Soak a few thin slices of stale, 
light, and well- baked bread in hot water, so as to 
Ibrm a pulp of suitable consistence. Simmer it 
gently, with some little addition of water from time 
to time as it thickens; then add two or three table- 
spoonfuls of warm milk, a little loaf sugar, and a 
few grains of salt. The objection to this bread-pap 
as commonly used, is, that nurses are sometimes apt 
to make it too thick. 

farinaceous foods with milk. 

BouiLLiE OF Baked Flour. — Bake in a slow 
oven two ounces of flour until it is lightly colored. 
Take one tablespoonful and mix it smoothly with a 
quarter of a pint of cold water in a basin, while 
three-quarters of a pint of new milk is simmering. 
Mix gradually the hot milk with the baked flour 
and water; then pour into a saucepan, and simmer 
for ten minutes, stirring it so as to prevent any burn- 
ing. Sweeten it moderately with loaf sugar, and 
add a few grains of salt. »> W;i -k' 

BouiLLiEOF Boiled Flour. — Instead of baked 
flour, boiled flour may be used. It is prepared as 
follows : Tie up a pound of flour tightly in a linen 
cloth, and boil it for five hours. Peel off the outer 
rind. A tablespoonful of the inside must be finely 
grated, and used for bouillie, in the following man 



INVALID CXDOKERY. 411 

ner : Take of the grated boiled flour one table- 
epoonful, and mix smoothly with a little water in a 
basin. Then pour upon it, gradually, one pint of 
milk that has simmered, and mix all well together. 
Pour into a saucepan and boil gently for ten minutes, 
or rather longer. Add a few grains of salt and 
sweeten with loaf sugar. 

Glycerin and Yelk of F,gg. — The Phila- 
delphia Journal of Pliarmacy has made known a 
formula for a preparation which is likely to prove 
valuable for external use. Four parts, by weight, 
of yelk of egg are to be rubbed in a mortar with 
five parts of glycerin. The compound has the 
consistence of honey, and is unctuous like fatty 
substances, over which it has the advantage of be- 
ing easily removed by water. It is unalterable, a 
specimen having laid exposed to the air for three 
years unchanged. Applied to the skin, it forms a 
varnish which effectually prevents the action of air. 
These properties render it serviceable for broken 
surfaces of all kinds, particularly erysipelas and 
cutaneous affections, of which it allays the itching. 

• jV\''lNE Whey. — Boil a pint of new milk, add to 
it a glass or two of white wine, put it on the fire 
until it just boils again, then set it aside until the 
curd settles, pour off the clean whey ; sweeten to 
the taste. Cider is as good as wine to curdle, if it 
is good apple cider. 

Arrowroot Pap with Milk. — Put into a 



412 INVALID COOKERY. 

saucepan, to boil, one pint of milk ; stir very 
smoothly, into a cup of cold milk, a dessertspoonful 
of arrowroot ; when the milk boils, stir in the arrow- 
root ; continue to stir until it is cooked, which will 
be in five or ten minutes; remove from the fire, 
sweeten and flavor to the taste. 

Port Wine Jelly. — A pint of port wine, one 
ounce and a half of isinglass, three-quarters of an 
ounce of gum-arabic, four ounces and a half of 
powdered loaf sugar; stand it on the hob until dis- 
solved ; when cold it is fit for use. 

Orange Jelly. — Grate the rind of two oranges 
and two lemons, squeeze the juice of three of each 
and strain, and add the juice of a quarter of a 
pound of lump sugar and a quarter of a pint of 
water, and boil till it almost candies. Have ready 
a quart of isinglass jelly made with two ounces ; 
put to it the syrup and boil it once up ; strain off 
the jelly, and let it stand to settle before it is put 
into the mould. 

Porter Jelly. — Half an ounce of isinglass to 
a quart of porter ; put into the oven till dissolved ; 
strain and sweeten to your taste. When cold it 
will jelly. 

Sago Jelly. — A teacupful of sago, boiled in 
three pints and a half of water till ready. When 
cold, add half a pint of raspberry syrup. Pour it 
into a shape which has been rinsed in cold water, 
and let it stand until it is sufficiently set to turn out 



INVALID COOKERY. 413 

well. When dished, pour a little cream round it, 
if preferred. 

Gelatine. — This is prepared for jellies by soak- 
ing over night in very little water; allow one ounce 
for each quart of jelly. If the isinglass is not pure, 
it must be clarified. Mix, in half a pint of water, 
a teaspoonful of the white of egg and a little lemon- 
juice; beat well, and stir it into two ounces isin- 
glass, which is dissolved in half a pint of water; 
heat these together gradually, constantly stirring; 
remove all the scum, and pass it through a flannel 
jelly-bag. 

Jelly from Gelatine. — One ounce and a half 
of gelatine put over night into a pint of cold water, 
with the rinds and juice of three lemons. Next 
morning add a pint of boiling water, half a pint 
of sherry, the whites and shells of three eggs, and 
sweeten to your taste. Boil the whole ten minutes, 
and strain through a jelly-bag. This will make a 
quart of jelly. Be sure not to stir the mixture after 
it is placed on the fire. It is excellent.

CHAPTER XIII. 

MISCELLANEOUS. 

""'A Bill of Fare. — Put the soup first ; always 
eat the melon immediately after ; then the fish ; then 
butcher's meat — beef, next mutton, next veal and 
lamb; then poultry, and last of all game. A roasted 
fish is served after the roast beef. VegetabU^s au 
suei'e are served after the other vegetables. Cheese 
is served before dessert. Tin-liued utensils for the 
kitchen are preferable to porcelain, because porce- 
lain cracks so easily. Copper is the best, if kept 
perfectly clean. For boiling milk, block-tin is the 
best. Always use a stone mortar, not a wooden one, 
and have a sharp-pointed knife for boning meat or 
fish. 

Coloring for Gravies and Ragouts. — Take 
four ounces of sugar (moist), and set it over the fire 
in a clean stewpan or earthen pipkin. When the 
sugar is melted and looks frothy, raise it higher 
from the fire, that it may not burn ; keep stirring 
it all the time till it is a fine brown ; pour in some 
red wine, taking care it does riot boil over, add a 
little salt, lemon, mace, and a few cloves; boil all 
up gently for ten minutes, and pour it into a basin. 
When cold, put it into a bottle well corked. 
414 



MISCELLANEOUS. 415 

Rich Gkavy. — Cut beef into thin slices, accord- 
ing to the quantity wanted ; slice onions thin, and 
flour both; fry them of a light pale brown, but do 
not on any account suffer them to get black ; put 
them into a stewpan, pour boiling water on the 
browning in the frying-pan, boil it up, and pour on 
the meat. Put to it a bunch of parsley, thyme, and 
savory, a small bit of knotted marjoram, the same 
of tarragon, some mace, allspice, whole black pep- 
pers, a clove or two, and a bit of ham, or slice of 
bacon. Simmer till you have extracted all the juice 
of the meat, and be sure to skim the moment it boils, 
and often after. 

Meat or Fish Omelettes Generally. — Take 
cold meat, fish, game or poultry of any kind ; re- 
move all skin, sinew, etc., and either cut it small or 
pound it to a paste in a mortar, together with a 
proper proportion of spices and salt ; then either toss 
it in a buttered fiying-pan over a clear fire till it 
begins to brown, and pour beaten eggs upon it, or 
beat it up with the eggs, or spread it upon them 
after they have begun to set in the pan. In any 
case, serve hot, with or without a sauce, but gar- 
nished with crisp herbs in branches, or pickles, or 
sliced lemon. The right proportion is one table- 
spoonful of meat to four eggs. A little milk, gravy, 
water, or white wine, may be advantageously added 
to the eggs while they are being beaten. 

Milk Toast. — Boil a pint of rich milk, and 

27 



416 MISCELLANEOUS. 

then take it off, and stir into it a quarter of a pound 
of fresh butter, mixed with a small tablespoonful of 
flour. Then let it again come to boil. Have ready- 
two deep plates with half a dozen slices of toast in 
each. Pour the milk over them hot, and keep them 
covered till they go to table. Milk toast is generally 
eaten at breakfast. The warming of the bread gradu- 
ally through on both sides is a very great improve- 
ment upon the quality of the toast. All kinds of 
toast must be done the same way ; but if to be served 
under a bird, eggs, or kidneys, it requires to be 
toasted drier. Dry toast should not be made until 
quite ready to serve; when done, place it in a toast 
rack, or upon its edges, one piece resting against an- 
other. Any kind of toast that has been made half 
an hour is not worth eating. 

Breakfast Dish. — Two kidneys, one table- 
spoonful of flour, pepper and salt, half a teaspoon- 
ful of each, one tablespoonful of walnut catsup or 
walnut pickle juice, two tablespoonfuls of gravy, one 
round of buttered toast, half a glass of claret. Skin 
and cut the kidneys into fine, thin slices, and shake 
the flour well over them ; place all the other ingre- 
dients, except the toast, in a saucepan, and let it boil 
gently for five minutes. Place it at the side of the 
fire till it ceases boiling, add the kidneys, and let it 
^tew gently for ten minutes, but be sure it does not 
boil. Have the toast ready in a hot dish, pour it on 
the toast, and serve immediately.

SMALii Egg-Balls to Serve with Calf's 
Head. — Four eggs, a teaspoonful of flour, M'ater. 
Bpil three eggs for six minutes, take the yelks, and 
pound them in a mortar, add the flour and the yelk 
of the raw egg, beat all together till quite smooth, 
then roll the mixture into little balls, and throw 
them into boiling water for two minutes just before 
the dish is served, and strew them over the head. 

Good Meat Cake. — Mince the lean of cold 
Iamb or veal very finely ; soak a large slice of bread 
in boiling milk ; mash it, and mix it with the minced 
meat ; also a beaten egg, some boiled chopped pars- 
ley and thyme, a little grated lemon peel, pepper 
and salt. Make it into small, flat cakes, and fry 
them in butter or lard. Serve them up dry, or 
with good gravy, 

Superior Meat Pies. — Take the meat of a good- 
sized, fat chicken (boiled) ; add to it half a pound 
of good boiled beef's tongue, quarter of a pound of 
fresh butter, pepper and salt to taste, and about a 
dozen good boiled potatoes, and four good-sized 
onions. Chop all these ingredients fine, make a 
good crust, and cover the bottom of your dish. Put 
the ingredients in, and cook or bake it well. 

To Use the Meat and Gristle op a Soup 
Bone. — Cut all the gristle from the bone, boil until 
perfectly tender. If there is enough to serve for a 
dish, add vinegar, butter, pepper, and salt, and it 
will resemble souse ; if not, mix the meat with it,

of flour, and sufficient water to make the gravy, and 
serve with dry bread toasted. Lay the bread on 
the plate and pour over it the fricassee. 

Rissoles. — Chop the meat very fine ; if mutton, 
a little parsley will be an improvement; season it, 
and rub some butter in. Make up the rissoles iu 
the form of a sugar loaf, beat an egg and roll them 
in it, and then in bread crumbs, very fine, twice. 
Fry them a nice golden brown, and serve up with 
good gravy in the dish. Or: The meat must be 
chopped very fine. Take an equal quantity of 
bread crumbs, a tablespoonful of flour, a little all- 
spice, salt, and half an onion, chopped very fine, 
indeed. First mix the bread crumbs, flour, and 
spice together, then mix the meat well with it, 
sprinkle the onion over, stir all well together, and 
stir in two tablespoonfuls of bacon fat, or a rasher 
or two of bacon, finely minced. Make the mixture 
into balls with a very little milk, press them flat, 
roll each in flour, and drop them one at a time into 
a saucepan of boiling dripping, frying each simply 
in this way. When brown, take it out with an 
egg-slice, let the fat drain from it, place it on a pad 
of paper before the fire, so as to become quite dry. 

Rissoles of Cold Meat. — To one pound of cold 
meat allow three-quarters of a pound of bread crumbs, 
salt and pepper, a tablespoonful of minced parsley, 
a little finely-chopped lemon-peel, and two eggs. 



MISCELLANEOUS. 419 

Mince the meat very fine ; mix all together. Divide 
into balls or cones, nicely shaped. Put them intx5 a 
pan of boiling lard ; there must be enough lard to 
cover them. Fry the rissoles till they are a nice 
light brown. Serve with parsley for a garnish, or, 
if preferred, with gravy poured over them. Chicken 
or rabbit makes very delicious rissoles. 

RissABLES are made with veal and ham, chopped 
very fine, or pounded lightly; add a few bread 
crumbs, salt, pepper, nutmeg, and a little parsley 
and lemon-peel ; mix all together with the yelks of 
eggs, well beaten ; either roll them into shape like 
a flat sausage, or into the shape of peai^s, sticking a 
bit of horseradish in the ends to resemble the stalks. 
Egg each over, and grate bread crumbs. Fry thera 
brown, and serve on crisp-fried parsley. 

Lard. — Leaf lard is the nicest for all cooking 
purposes. Skim all the fat that is to be tried into 
lard, and commence by frying gently a little leaf 
lard, or your fat will scorch. Let it cool slowly, 
and dip oif the fat as soon as it is liquified, and 
strain it through a cloth. When all is strained that 
can be dipped off, squeeze the remainder by itself in 
the cloth. If the lard is to be used for cooking, salt 
it a trifle when first put on. Much of the salt will 
be found at the bottom of the kettle undissolved, 
still it would seem to be better that salt should be 
used. 

Forcemeat. — Half a pound of bread crumbs, a 



420 MISCELLANEOUS. 

tablespoonful of finely chopped parsley, a teaspoon- 
ful of sweet herbs, a little grated lemon-jDeel and 
nutmeg, seasoning of salt, pepper, and Cayenne, two 
ounces of beef suet, very finely chopped, and two 
eggs, a little beaten. Mix all together. The flavor 
of a little chopped lean ham or bacon is relished by 
some persons. 

Forcemeat for Veal, Turkeys, Fowls, etc. 
— Two ounces of ham or bacon, quarter of a pound 
of suet, the rind of half a lemon, one teaspoonful of 
minced parsley, one teaspoonful of minced sweet 
herbs, salt, Cayenne, and pounded mace to taste, six 
ounces of bread crumbs, two eggs. Shred the ham 
or bacon, chop the suet, lemon-peel, and herbs, tak- 
ing particular care that all be very finely minced ; 
add a seasoning to taste, of salt, Cayenne, and mace, 
and blend all thoroughly together with the bread 
crumbs before wetting. Now beat and strain the 
eggs, work these up with the other ingredients, and 
the forcemeat will be ready for use. When it is 
made into balls, fry of a nice brown in boiling lard, 
or put them on a tin and bake for half an hour in a 
moderate oven. As we have stated before, no one 
flavor should predominate greatly, and the force- 
meat should be of sufficient body to cut with a knife, 
and yet not dry and heavy. For very delicate 
forcemeat it is advisable to pound the ingredients 
together before binding with the egg ; but for ordi- 
nary cooking, mincing very finely answers the pur- 
pose. 



MISCELLANEOUS. 421 

Ramakins. — Beat up well two eggs, and add two 
tablespoonfuls of flour, two ounces of warm butter, 
and two ounces of grated cheese. Mix all these 
well together, and bake them for a quarter of an 
hour in small boxes made of writing paper. They 
should be served hot in the paper boxes, and eaten 
after the game course. They require care in the 
preparation. 

Eggs may be preserved by applying with a brush 
a solution of gum- Arabic to the shells, and after- 
wards packing them in dry charcoal dust. 

Farm-House Syllabub. — Fill a china or 
earthenware bowl of any size nearly half full of 
cider (if sour, it is of no consequence), sweeten to 
the taste with coarse brown sugar, grate nutmeg 
and cinnamon to taste ; then send the bowl out to 
the cow to be milked on till quite full of froth. A 
better syllabub for company is made of port wine 
and cider mixed (or port wine only), sweetened 
with white sugar, and spice to taste. 

Lait Sucre. — Take one pint of milk, add loaf 
sugar, and flavor with lemon. Drink cold. 

Nutmegs. — Oil of nutmegs being of great value, 
it is often extracted from the nuts which are exposed 
to sale, and which are tliereby rendered of very 
little value. To ascertain the quality of nutmegs, 
force a pin into them ; and if good, however dry 
they may appear, the oil will be seen oozing out all 



422 MISCELLANEOUS. 

round the pin from the compression 'occasioned in 
the surrounding parts. 

Essence of Nutmegs. — Dissolve one ounce of 
the rectified oil of nutmegs in one pint of rectified 
spirits of wine. 

Essence of Rose. — Take one ounce of ninety- 
five per cent, alcohol, and drop into it thirty drops 
of ottar of roses. Shake it up well, let it stand 
two days, when it is fit for use. 

How TO Mix Mustaed. — Mustard should be 
mixed with water that has been boiled and allowed 
to cool ; hot water destroys its essential properties, 
and raw cold water might cause it to ferment. Put 
the mustard in a cup, with a small pinch of salt, 
and mix with it very gradually sufficient boiled 
water to make it drop from the spoon without 
being watery. Stir and mix well, and rub the 
lumps well down with the back of a spoon, as 
mustard properly mixed should be perfectly free 
from these. The mustard-pot should not be more 
than half full, or rather less, if it will not be used 
for a day or two, as the mustard is so muoh better 
when fresh made. 

To Make Good Vinegar. — One pint of strained 
honey and two gallons of soft water. Let it stand 
in a moderately warm place. In three weeks it 
will be excellent vinegar. 

Excellent Vinegar can be made without any 
cost at all, by simply putting your apple-peelinga 



MISCELLANEOUS. 423 

into a large stone jug, and filling the jug up with 
water. After leaving it quietly stand in some 
moderately warm place for about four or five weeks 
(always putting in the apple-peelings of every day), 
you will find that you have as good, or rather better 
vinegar than you can buy from any grocer, and 
which -does not cost you one cent. 

Mint Vinegar. — Put into a wide-mouthed 
bottle fresh, nice, clean mint leaves, enough to fill 
it loosely; then fill up the bottle with good vinegar, 
and after it has been stopped close for two or three 
weeks, it is to be poured off clean into another bottle, 
and kept well corked for use. Serve with lamb 
when mint cannot be obtained. 

Cayenne Vinegab. — Half an ounce of Cayenne 
pepper, half a pint of strong spirit, or one pint of 
vinegar. Put the vinegar or spirit, into a bottle, 
with the above proportion of Cayenne, and let it 
steep for a month; then strain off and bottle for 
use. This is an excellent seasoning for all kinds 
of soups and sauces, but must be used very spar- 
ingly. 

QuAJADA. — Make a large pan of curds and whey 
or sour milk ; cut a piece of rennet the size of a 
dinner-plate, put it in a stone crock, pour over it 
all the whey, and add a large handful of salt; set 
it behind the stove all night. Next morning, pour 
this whey slowly through a sieve into "four or five 
quarts of milk ; leave it until it thickens ; then, 



424 MISCELLANEOUS. 

with the open hands, gently press the curd down 
without breaking until it .separates from the water. 
Take a napkin and gently place the curd in it, 
double it squarely, and tie tightly in a cross tie. 
Hang this to drain all night. It will be fit for use the 
next day, and is to be served with preserved fruit. 

Toad in the Hole.— Six ounces of flour, one 
pint of milk, three eggs, butter, a few slices of cold 
mutton, pepper and salt to taste, and two kidneys. 
Make a smooth batter of flour, milk, and eggs in 
the above proportion ; butter a baking-dish and 
pour in the batter. Into this put the mutton, well 
seasoned, and the kidneys cut into small pieces. 
Bake one hour, and serve in the baking-dish. Oys- 
ters may be substituted for the kidneys. 

A Relish. — Put bread crumbs into a saucepan 
with cream, salt, and pepper ; when the bread has 
absorbed the cream or milk, break in a few eggs, 
and fry as omelette. 

Pikelets. — Take three pounds of flour ; make 
a hole in the middle with your hand. Mix two 
spoonfuls of yeast with a little salt and as much 
milk as will make the flour into a light paste. 
Pour the milk, with the yeast, into the middle of 
the flour, and stir a little of the flour down into it; 
then let it stand all night, and the next morning 
work in all the flour ; beat it well for a quarter of 
an hour ; let it stand for an hour ; take it out with 
a large spoon, lay it in round cakes on a board, well 



MISCELLANEOUS. 425 

dusted with flour; dredge flour over them, pat theai 
with your hand, and bake them. 

Cheesikins. — Quarter pound of stale bread, 
quarter pound of cheese, two ounces of butter, two 
eggs, a teaspoonful of mustard flour, half teaspoon- 
ful of pepper, a few grains of Cayenne. Rub the 
bread into fine crumbs, grate the cheese, melt the 
butter, and mix with the rest of the ingredients, 
and the eggs, which should be previously beaten. 
Let the mixture stand for about an hour, and then 
knead it into a paste, roll it out very thin, cut into 
small pieces, and bake in a quick oven. Time, 
about fifteen or sixteen minutes. 

A German Entremet. — Boil eight eggs quite 
hard, and when cold cut them in two lengthwise. 
Take the yelks out very carefully, pass them through 
a fine sieve, and mix them well with half a pint of 
cream, (or more, if required,) and then add pepper, 
salt, and herbs. Pour this sauce into a very flat 
pie-dish that will stand heat, and place the white 
half eggs carefully in it, arranging them in the form 
of a star, or any other pattern preferred. Fill up 
the vacancy left in them by the yelks having been 
removed, with the same mixture, and strew a few " 
bread crumbs over them. Bake this very slightly, 
just enough to give it a bright yellow color, and 
serve it up in the dish in which it has been baked. 

Gravy for Fowls, or other Delicate 
Dishes. — Take half a pound of lean beef, slice 



426 MISCELLANEOUS. 

and score it, and a piece of butter the eize of a nut- 
meg. Sprinkle it with flour, add a small onion, 
then put it all into a stewpan ; stir it round over 
the fire for ten minutes, then pour into it one pint 
of boiling water ; skim it carefully ; let it all boil 
together for five minutes ; strain it, and it is ready. 

To Keep Sausage Fresh all the Yeae. — 
Make into cakes, and fry as if for present use ; 
pack in stone jars, and if the grease that fries out 
of the meat is not sufficient to cover it, pour over 
hot lard so as to cover it, and entirely exclude the 
air. 

Rolled Patties from Remains of Meat. — 
The remains of roast veal, or any roast meat, is 
chopped very fine with fat or ham, adding to it a 
little nutmeg, salt, and butter, some eggs, parsley, 
and chopped shalots. Stir this over the fire till 
thick enough for stuffing; fill some rolls with tHjs, 
and bake as the patties for field-fare. 

CULINARY COUPLETS. 

BY A RHYMING EPICURE. 

Always have lobster sauce with salmon, 
And put mint sauce your roasted lamb on. 

Yeal cutlets dip in egg and bread crumb — 
Fry till you see a brownish red come. 

Grate Gruyere cheese on macaroni ; 
Make the top crisp, but not too bony. 

In venison gravy, currant jelly 
Mix with old port — see Francat«lli. 



MISCELLANEOUS. 42? 

In dressing salad, mind this law — 
With two hard yelks use one that's raw. 

Roast veal with rich stock gravy serve ; 
And pickled mushrooms, too, observe. 

Roast pork, sans apple sauce, past doubt^ 
Is " Hamlet" with the Prince left out. 

Your mutton-chops with paper cover, , 

And make them amber brown all over. 

Broil lightly your beefsteaks — to fry it 
Argues contempt of Christian diet. 

Kidneys a finer flavor gain 

By stewing them in good champagne. 

Buy stall-fed pigeons. When you've got them, 
The way to cook them is to pot them. 

Woodgrouse are dry when gumps have marred 'em— 
Before you roast 'em always lard 'em. 

To roast spring chickens is to spoil 'em — 
Just split 'em down the back and broil 'em. 

It gives true epicures the vapors 
To see boiled mutton, minus capers. 

Boiled turkey, gourmands know, of course, 
Is exquisite wfth celery sauce. 

The cook deserves a hearty cufiBng 

Who serves roast fowls with tasteless stuffing. 

Smelts require egg and biscuit powder. 
Don't put fat pork m your clam chowder. 

Egg sauce — few make it right, alas ! 
Is good with blue-fish or with b^as. 



428 MISCELLANEOUS. 

Nice oyster sauce gives zest to cod — 
A fish, when fresh, to feast a god. 

Shad, stuffed and baked, is most delicious- 
'Twould have electrified Apicius. 

Roasted in paste, a haunch of mutton, 
Might make ascetics play the glutton. 

Bst one might rhyme for weeks this way, 
And still have lots of things to say. 

And so I'll close — for, reader mite, 
This is about the hour I dine.
