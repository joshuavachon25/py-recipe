Introduction 



TT is not wise for a man who can get sea- 
sick in a rowboat on a mill-pond to 
attack a Japanese dinner just after a seven- 
teen days' voyage across the Pacific. I was 
just that unwise, and for that reason perhaps 
can do but scant justice in this Land of the 
Rising Sun, to a soup in which floats bits of 
strange fishes from the vasty deep, unknown 
green things and an island of yellow custard ; 
to slices of many colored raw fish, tough 
cocks' combs (real ones) or even to the 
stewed chicken which at this dinner at least 
had been shorn of everything except bones 
and tough sinews. The other day I tried it 
^ain with no better success, and now with 
the prospect of rice for food three times a 
day in the field around Port Arthur and no

bread (there can be no more serious depriva- 
tion to a Southerner) I am suddenly asked 
to think of a Kentucky table and that tur- 
baned mistress of the Blue Grass kitchen, a 
Kentucky cook ! 

It is June in Japan, and it is June in that 
blessed land of the Blue Grass. The sun 
shines there, no doubt, right now : the corn 
top's ripe; the meadows are in bloom and 
along turnpike and out in the fields the 
song and laughter of darkies make gay the 
air. It is early morning. The singing of 
birds comes through the open windows — the 
chatter of blackbirds and the mid-air calls of 
far away meadow larks. Through those 
windows sleepy eyes see wood and field, 
with stretches of blossoming blue grass rip- 
pling in the wind. Another half-conscious 
doze for an hour, another awakening, and by 
your bed stands a black boy in a snowy 
apron, his white teeth shining, and in his 
kindly black paws a silver goblet on a silver 
tray. Heavens, how it hurts to smell ths|t 
mint this far away ! The goblet is gleaming 
with frost, and the mint is still drenched

INTRODUCTION 



with dew. Who was it sang of the ecstasy 
of awakening on a June morning and being 
in love? Well, to the wise one who has 
that blissful state only as a memory a hint is 
sufficient. 

It is now breakfast time. There are 
strawberries in Japan, but there are also 
strawberries in the Blue Grass, and I shall 
not risk international complications by in- 
vidious comparison. In the Blue Grass they 
go with a yellow cream of which I dare not 
think. You shall find that same cream in a 
cup of fragrant coffee as well. There is 
broiled ham with a grateful odor whose 
source is a mystery ; there are plates of hot 
thin meal batter cakes, each encircled with 
crisp, delicate black embroidery, and there is 
golden butter that melts and drips and seeps 
between the layers. It is too early for 
game-birds, so those little brown, fat, broiled 
things resting in the big dish are spring 
chickens, "frying size," as we say in the 
Blue Grass, and on another dish there they 
are again — fried, after Southern style, half 
submerged in a rich cream of gravy, snow

white. I can go no further now, for the 
waffles are yet to come. 

You climb a horse now and ride out into 
the morning and the sunUght and the fresh 
air, into the singing of those birds and the 
rippling stretches of blue grass, wheat and 
barley and wind-shaken corn. Under full- 
leafed maples and oaks and sycamores where 
fat cattle are tearing up rich mouthfuls of 
grass, and sheep and young lambs are graz- 
ing and playing along a creek whose banks 
are grassy to the very water's edge. Three 
hours you ride, for you must see the whole 
place that morning. Guests are coming to 
dinner, and there will be little time in the 
afternoon, so through lanes in which the 
wild rose blooms and through woods and 
meadows you lope for home. How hungry 
you are ! The pike gate slams, the first 
guest is coming, and up the hill they wind in 
buggy, carriage, and on horseback. When 
all are gathered in the drawing-room, you 
shall see the host quietly lead some man to 
the veranda — it is a magic signal that need 
not be explained. Out there are more of 

viii 



INTRODUCTION 



those frosted silver goblets, flowering with 
green and "'with beaded bubbles winking at 
the brim." 

And now dinner. 

The dining-room is the biggest and sun- 
niest in the house. On the wall are hunting 
prints, pictures of game and stag heads. 
The table runs almost the length of it, and 
the snowy table-cloth hangs almost to the 
floor. Before your hostess is a great tureen 
of calf s-head soup ; before your host a saddle 
of venison, drenched in a bottle of ancient 
Madeira and flanked by flakes of red-cur- 
rant jelly. Before one guest are broiled 
wild ducks. After the venison comes a 
great turkey, and last of all a Kentucky 
ham. 

" That ham ! Mellow, aged, boiled in 
champagne, baked brown, spiced deeply, 
rosy pink within and of a flavor and fra- 
grance to shatter the fast of a pope; and 
without a brown-edged white layer so firm 
that the deft carving knife passing through 
gave no hint to the eye that it was delicious 
fat. . . . The rose flakes dropped under 

ix

the knife in such thin slices that the edges 
coiled." 

After the ham the table-cloth is lifted and 
the dessert spread on another lying beneath. 
Then that, too, is raised and the nuts and 
wines are placed on a third — red damask this 
time. So much for breakfast and dinner — 
the old-time dinner. At the thought of 
supper the pen of this exile halts, and for it 
the reader may search within. 

Is it any wonder that the stories of South- 
ern hospitality are so many and so good ? It 
is said that in Texas a planter will some- 
times waylay the passing stranger, and at the 
point of a shot-gun force him to halt and 
stay a month. I have heard of a man stop- 
ping to spend the night on a Georgia plan- 
tation and staying on for twenty years. I 
have heard of an old major in Virginia, the 
guest of the father of a friend of mine, who 
every spring had his horse saddled and 
brought to the fence, when the following 
annual colloquy took place : 

"Oh, you'd better stay a while longer, 
Major," the host would say. 



INTRODUCTION 



"No," the Major would say," I reckon I'd 
better be goin'." 

After every mint julep this interchange 
would take place. At the end of the third 
the Major invariably weakened. 

" Well," he would say, " I reckon I'll stay 
a Httle longer." And he would stay — another 
year. This went on for a decade. 

These things I have heard — what follows 
I know. There was a famous place near 
Lexington once which I will call Silver 
Springs, and there was a guest there of 
twenty years' standing. One morning he 
went over to the home of his host's son, liked 
it over there and stayed ten years until he 
died. But there is yet a better story of Silver 
Springs. So many guests actually died there 
that the host provided them with a graveyard. 
Some fifteen years ago the church near by 
was torn down, the graveyard was sold, and 
all the bodies had to be removed. The son 
of the master of Silver Springs wrote to what 
relatives of the dead guests he could find. 
No answer came, and the daughter of the 
son, who has been a lifelong friend of mine, 

xi 



THE BLUE GRASS COOK BOOK 

took the seven guests, sang " Nearer, my 
God, to Thee " over them, and buried them 
in the family plot. There the seven rest 
to-day. 

Now the social system of the South rested 
on the slave, and the three pillars of the sub- 
structure vi^ere the overseer, the black 
mammy and Aunt Dinah, the cook. But 
for Aunt Dinah would the master have had 
the heart for such hospitality? Would the 
guest have found it so hard to get away ? 
Would stories like these ever have been 
born ? Would the Kentuckian have had 
the brawn and brain that have given him 
such a history ? Would Kentucky have sent 
the flower of her youth, forty thousand 
strong, into the Confederacy; would she 
have lifted the lid of her treasury to Lincoln, 
and in answer to his every call sent him a 
soldier practically without a bounty and 
without a draft; and when the curtain fell 
on the last act of the great tragedy would 
she have left half of her manhood behind it 
— helpless from disease, wounded or dead on 
the battlefield ? I think not.

INTRODUCTION 



All honor then to that turbaned mistress of 
the Kentucky kitchen — the Kentucky cook. 
She came to the Blue Grass from Virginia 
more than a hundred years ago, swift on the 
flying feet of the Indian. She was broad, 
portly, kind of heart, though severe of coun- 
tenance, as befitted her dignity, and usually 
quick of temper and sharp of tongue. Her 
realm was not limited to the kitchen. She 
disputed the power of ' 'mammy " in the 
drawing-room, and there were times when 
all, black and white, bowed down before 
her. James Lane Allen has written that, 
going home with a friend late one night 
after a party, his friend got up at five 
o'clock the next morning and made him get 
up, through fear of rousing the temper of 
this same black, autocratic cook. But when 
she was kind she was mighty ; and is there a 
Southerner who does not hold her, in spite 
of her faults, in loving remembrance ? As 
far as I know she has never got her just due. 
She is gone, and there are good ones to-day 
who fill her place, but none who are full 
worthy. Publicly I acknowledge an ever-

lasting debt, and to that turbaned mistress of 
the Kentucky kitchen gratefully this South- 
erner takes off his hat.

1 pint of floui", 
1 rounded tablespoon of lard, 
1 good pinch of salt. 
Mix with very cold sweet milk to a stiff dough. 
Work 150 times through a kneader. Roll into 
sheet one-half inch thick. Cut out or make out 
with the hands. Stick with a fork and bake in a 
hot oven about twenty minutes till a rich brown. 

MT. AIRY BEATEN BISCUITS 

Mrs. Simms 
3 pints of flour sifted, 
1 large kitchen spoon of lard, 
1 teaspoon salt. 



THE BLUE GRASS COOK BOOK 

Have the lard well chilled on ice. Rub the lard 
into two pints of the flour. Make this into a stiff 
dough with ice water and a very little milk. Work 
through a kneader 150 times, gradually adding the 
other pint of flour, or till the dough is perfectly 
smooth. Roll out one-half inch thick, cut into bis- 
cuits, stick with a fork, and bake in a moderate oven 
till light brown. Serve hot.

The dough can be kept for two days if put in a 
tightly covered jar and kept on ice or in a cool 
place. Roll from 150 to 200 times through the 
kneader. Bake from twenty to twenty-five minutes 
in a hot oven. If the stove is hot enough to blister 
them before they are baked, place a bread-pan on 
the upper grating. Many of the best housekeepers 
prefer the old way of making the biscuits out by 
hand to the use of the cutter.

Drain large, plump oysters and free them from 
small pieces of shells. Lay them on a cloth to dry. 
Season with milk, salt, and pepper, and dip in 
beaten egg and roll in cracker dust. Fry a light 
brown in hot lard and serve at once. 

FRIED OYSTERS (No. 2) 

Choose large oysters and drain thoroughly in a 
colander. Dry in a towel. Dip each oyster first 
in sifted cracker-crumbs; then in egg (1 egg 
beaten with a large spoonful of cold water, % a 
teaspoon of salt, a saltspoon of pepper, being 
enough for 2 dozen oysters). Roll again in 
crumbs, and lay them in a wire frying basket, and, 
holding the basket by the handle, dip into a kettle 
of boiling lard; use a porcelain kettle almost one- 
third full of lard. Dip the basket in and let it re- 
main until the oysters are a light brown ; then turn 
out on a piece of brown paper until they are so 
free from grease that they can be served in a nap- 
kin laid in the platter. The albumen in the egg 
makes a coating over the oyster so that the grease

begins to boil, stir this into it ; stir constantly until 
the sauce boils again; then add the seasoned 
chicken and cook for three minutes ; beat two of the 
eggs until light and stir them into the boiling in- 
gredients ; take from the fire immediately and pour 
into a flat dish, to get very cold, for an hour or so. 
The colder the mixture becomes, the more easily 
the cutlets can be formed. Butter a cutlet mould 
thoroughly and sprinkle some crumbs into it; pack 
with the chicken, and then give the mould a tap on 
the table to make the cutlet drop out. The mould 
is buttered only once, but is sprinkled with crumbs 
each time a new cutlet is formed. When all the 
chicken has been used, beat the two remaining eggs 
in a deep plate and put some of the crumbs in an- 
other plate ; drop the cutlets into the eggs first, and 
into the crumbs afterward; at serving time put 
them into a frying-basket, being careful not to

and lay on ice 12 hours before cooking. Cut the 
chicken in pieces and dredge with flour and drop 
in hot boiling lard and butter — equal parts — salt 
and pepper, and cover tightly and cook ra*^her 
slowly — if it cooks too quickly it will burn. Cook 
both sides to a rich brown. Remove chicken and 
make a gravy by adding milk, flour, butter, salt, 
and pepper. Cook till thick, and serve in separate 
bowl.

ROASTED CHICKEN 

Prepare a full-grown chicken or hen, sprinkle 
with salt, lay on ice for 12 hours or longer. Put 
in pan and add 1 pint water, and cook till tender, 
adding water if needed. Then make a dressing 
of bread-crumbs, butter, salt and pepper, and a 
little onion, and make into cakes and lay around 
the fowl. Baste frequently with butter. Do not 
put the stuffing inside the fowl, as it will absorb 
the juices. Cook the giblets in the pan with the 
chicken. When the chicken is tender and cakes 
are a rich brown, remove from the pan. To the 
giblets add flour, butter, a little milk, and make a 
gravy, which serve in a separate bowl.

into a kettle of water, remembering to cover 
tightly; boil for IJ hours; there will be a quan- 
tity of gravy from the juice of the fowl and the 
oysters in the jar, which make into a white 
sauce with the addition of a little flour, cream, and 
butter; add some oysters to it or serve plain with 
the chicken. The gravy that comes from a fowl 
dressed in this manner will be a stiff' jelly next 
day, and the fowl will be white and tender and 
of an exceedingly fine flavor — advantages not

BLUE GRASS HAMS 

BAKED HAM 

Never bake a ham under a year old. Rub the 
ham thoroughly and put to soak in cold water for 
24 hours. Then cover with cold water in a boiler. 
When it begins to boil, set on back of stove and 
boil slowly till the bone is loose. (Twenty minutes 
to a pound is about the length of time required.) 
Then remove from stove and let stand in boiler till 
it is cool, over night or half a day. Put in a 
baking-pan and remove the skin and extra fat, 
being careful to keep the shape. Make a stiff bat- 
ter of flour and water and cover the top. Set it 
in the oven and bake slowly for 2 hours. Then 
remove batter and with a knife make slight inci- 
sions all over the ham and sprinkle first with brown 
sugar, about 1 tablespoonful, then sprinkle thor- 
oughly with black pepper. Make a dressing of 

97

grated bread or crackers, a little onion chopped 
fine, 1 tablespoon butter, pepper, salt, and mix 
with 1 egg and a little water. Cover the top with 
this dressing and put in oven to brown. Serve cold. 

COL. WM. RHODES ESTILL'S 
RECIPE FOR CURING HAMS 

Kill your hogs when the wind is from the north- 
west. The night before you salt the meat take a 
string of red pepper and make a strong tea. (Let 
it remain on the stove over night.) Put in the tea 

2 heaping tablespoons of saltpetre to every 2 gal- 
lons. Take this strong tea and pour on the salt. 
Salt the meat lightly the first time to run off the 
blood. Let the meat lie packed 3 days — ^longer, 
if the weather is very cold. Then overhaul the 
meat and put 1 teaspoon of pulverized saltpetre 
on the flesh side of each ham and rub in well. Then 
rub with molasses mixed with salt. Pack close for 
10 days. After this overhaul again, rubbing each 
piece, and pack close again. Hang the meat in 

3 weeks from the time the hogs were killed. Be- 
fore hanging, wash each piece in warm water, and 
while wet roll in hickory ashes. Then smoke with 
green hickory wood, and tie up in cotton bags in 
February.

HAM COOKED IN WINE 
Mrs. Henry C. Buckner 

Scrub well and soak an old ham in plenty of 
water for 48 hours. Weigh ham and allow ^ hour 
for each pound, place in large ham boiler and fill 
with cold water; let simmer (not boil) gently the 
allotted time. When half the time is up, pour off 
the water; fill again with fresh boiling water, into 
which put ^ cup of vinegar, a bay leaf and a few 
cloves, and finish cooking. Let the ham remain 
in the water until cool. Then remove the skin. 
Mix 2 tablespoonfuls of "Coleman's Mustard" with 
vinegar, spread over the ham, brush with the yolk 
of an egg. Sprinkle with bread-crumbs and 
sugar, pin on the fat side with cloves and a few 
raisins. 

With a sharp knife make incisions all through 
the ham, holding back the openings and pouring 
in ^ pint of sherry. Place in the oven for ^ hour, 
basting every 5 minutes. Do not cut until per- 
fectly cold.

ing-pan. Add enough water to keep from stick' 
ing. Baste frequently and cook till thoroughly 
done, or till the hock can be removed — 5 or 6 hours.. 
When done, skin it and make an icing of brown 
sugar and yolk of 1 egg, and cover top and grate 
bread-crumbs over. Put in oven and brown. 



SUGAR-CURED HA MS 

Mrs. Cassius M. Clay 

Let the hams lie in dry salt for 4 weeks after the 
killing. Then hang them up in the smoke-house 
and smoke them with dry hickory chips till they 
are a pretty light brown. Then rub them thor- 
oughly with a pomatum made of New Orleans mo- 
lasses, black and red pepper, using about 3 times 
as much black pepper as red. Mix the molasses 
and pepper in a large dish-pan, and if they do not 
mix easily, warm them by setting the pan on the 
stove. When it is well mixed, have a man hold 
the ham by the hock with one hand, and with the 
other rub the mixture well into the ham on both 
sides. Make good strong sacks and tie each ham 
and hang up with the hock down, as the ingredi- 
ents will be absorbed more readily.

MEATS 



They will be ready for use in about 8 or 10 
months. 

Hams a year old are better than older hams, as 
they get too dry and strong when kept too long. 
In cooking the ham a handful of cloves dropped in 
the water while boiling gives it a rich flavor.

MAYONNAISE 
Mrs. Henry C. Btuikner 

Yolk of 1 egg, 

^ teaspoonful of salt, 

Dash of cayenne pepper, 

1 cupful of salad oil, 

^ teaspoonful of lemon juice 
Let the oil and egg be very cold before using. 
Also the plate must be on ice; let the yolk be en- 
tirely free from any white. Add salt and pepper 
to egg and mix well, then add oil, drop by drop. 
The success depends on adding the oil slowly at 
first. Spend half of the time in incorporating the 
first 2 spoonsful of oil ; after that, it can be added 
a little faster. After it is thick, alternate a few 
drops of lemon juice or vinegar with the oil. A 
little tarragon vinegar is nice. If mustard is liked 
add ^ teaspoonful of dry mustard with the salt at 
the beginning. Some like a hard-boiled egg added 
to the raw egg.

PENDENNIS CLUB MINT 
JULEP 

By a wtU-known memAter of the club, Louisville, 
Ktf. 

These are some essentials : 

1st. Fine, straight, old Kentucky Bourbon 
whisky — ^blended whiskies do not give good results. 

2d. An abundant supply of freshly cut sprigs 
of mint — preferably young shoots — no portion of 
which has been bruised. 

3d. Dry, cracked flint ice. A glass will an- 
swer the purpose, but a silver mug is preferable. 
At this club, silver cups are kept on ice. A syrup 
of sugar and water is also kept on hand. 

The silver cup is first filled with the ice, and then 
the desired quantity of fine whisky poured in and 
thoroughly shaken with a spoon or shaker until a 
heavy frost forms on the mug. The desired 
amount of syrup is then poured in and stirred 
enough to be mixed. The mint is then carefully 
placed in the mugs with the stems barely sticking 
in the ice and the tops projecting 2 inches above 
the top of the cup. Straws are then placed in the 
cup, reaching from the bottom to about 1 inch 
above the top, and the sooner one sticks one's nose

jar of light-colored cider or wine vinegar. After 
a week or 10 days you must change to strong vine- 
gar, allowing ^ ounce of turmeric to each gallon of 
vinegar. 

Pack the cabbage and other ingredients as tight 
as you please, so they are kept covered by the vine- 
gar. Sprinkle the turmeric in layers as you pack, 
and pour the vinegar on last. Put a weight on the 
pickles, so as to keep them under the vinegar. 
After 3 weeks divide the ingredients and put in a

YELLOW PICKLE 

Miss Elise White 

Take cabbage, cauliflower, nasturtium seed, as- 
paragus, tender corn, and beans. Put into a kettle 
and pour over them boiling salt water and let stand 
2i hours. Make this pickle on a clear day, and 
press the water from each piece and lay to dry on a

and the sun bleaches. By turning them often they 
become white and receive the turmeric better. One 
day of hot sun is enough to prepare them for the 
first vinegar. When dry, put in a jar and cover 
with cold plain vinegar, with a little turmeric. Let 
stand 2 weeks and add spiced vinegar. Mix the 
turmeric smoothly before adding to the vinegar.
