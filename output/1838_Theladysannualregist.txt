ADVERTISEIVIENT. 

It is the design of the Lady's Annual Reg^ister to furhish a use- 
ful remembrancer to accompany the American housekeeper through 
the several months of the year, and by timely suggestions to aid her 
in her various duties — to present a record of all improvements and 
useful inventions in cookery, cooking apparatus, &c., — in short, of 
whatever may be particularly interesting to housekeepers, — to fur- 
nish a convenient receptacle for such recipes and memorandums as 
it is desirable to preserve — and by judicious and well written arti- 
cles (mostly original) intended both for amusement and instruction, 
to render the vvork an agreeable as well as useful companion in 
every house.

HOUSEWIFE'S MEMORANDUM-BOOK. 



THE FEAST OF THE BIONTHS. 

The months, who had been from each other estranged 
While over the wide earth on duty they ranged, 
Resolved, from the north, from the south, west and east, 
To unite in a full and harmonious feast. 
The Seasons as stewards stood forth in their stations. 
And the swiftly-winged Hours were to bear invitations. 

I fancy that never on earth was there given 
A party, where all things went smoothly and even ; 
Without painful affronts and offensive mistakes, 
Without spilling of syllabubs — burning of cakes ; 
The very best beaux by some accident slighted, 
The most stupid and vulgar politely invited ; 



10 THE lady's annual REGISTER. 

Six sisters accept, who sit silent in rows, 

Unfortunate creatures, whom ' nobody knows ' ; 

The guest most distinguished placed wrongly at table. 

With the only tough turkey — as tough as a cable, — 

While tittering girls and a dandified minion 

Cut up and throw by tender sidebone and pinion. 

A stripling gets hold of your number one Avine, 

With a smacking of lips as if racy and fine, 

While a connoisseur lights on a come-by-chance bottle, 

With grimaces as though every swallow would throttle. 

Yes, even the planning a dinner or rout, 
Brings temper and prejudice fearfully out, 
While the kindest of friends in an every-day life. 
In this field of temptation break forth into strife. 

'T was thus that the months, who in amity met. 
Ere an hour's discussion broke out in a pet. 
There was scoffing and jeering, while home-truths were told. 
Some were slighted as young, and some taunted as old ; 
Miss April was vexed that December should come. 
Even June and October looked pouting and glum ; 
Wild March stamped about, rooting up the young flowers. 
And April dashed o'er him an urn full of showers ; 
Dark August was wrought to a tropical fever, 
And stigmatized May as coquette and deceiver ; 
July roll'd a thunder-bolt suddenly out, 
And' September a hurricane hurtled about; 
While old January took up a huge snow-ball. 
And vowed he would pelt all who voted for no ball. 



THE lady's annual REGISTER. 11 

How long might have lasted this mode of discussing, 
With minor objections 'mid flouting and fussing, 
I cannot decide ; but stern Time fixed the matter, 
For the feast-day approached 'mid the wrangling and clatter, 

' But the place of the meeting ! ' one suddenly cried — 
* The place, aye the place ! ' echoed loudly and wide. 

The Autumn months called for a far prairied field. 
Where bright Western wilds native luxuries yield, 
Where giant-like blossoms unfold into bloom, 
And the breezes go laden with wealth of perfume. 

The Winter months voted Niagara Falls, 
Where the deep to the deep through the ice-season calls, 
Where the snow-crested rocks and the rainbow-tinged spray 
Seem listening to shouts of the waters at play. 

The daughters of Spring asked the South's bahny land, 
Its sunshiny sky and its breezes so bland ; 
They would hold their fair feast 'neath the orange-tree's 
Or seek the recess the dark cypress had made. [shade, 

But June's voice was heard, and its silver}^ chime 
Pleaded sweetly the charms of her favorite clime, 
Where the Hudson glides onward in graceful repose, 
And nature her mantle of emerald throws ; 
Where the mountain and vale dwell in exquisite rest, 
Where the fleecy clouds hover still blessing and blest, 
Where the streamlet and blossom, the rainbow and bird, 
Bid the heart with unuttered emotions be stirred. 

Her Avishes prevailed, and a magical bov/er 
By Hudson's fair current arose in that hour ; 



12 



THE lady's annual REGISTER. 



And many a traveler gazed in surprise, 
For a softness more lovely beamed down from the skies ; 
The trees bent their branches in gracefuller play, 
The grass was more green, and the flowers more gay, 
■\Vliile deep choruses swelled on their listening ears, 
Like songs that roll out from the swift-moving spheres. 




THE lady's ANXUAL REGISTER. 



13 



The Feast of the Months continued. 

But, lo ! buttoned up with his furs to his chin, 
With a herald of sleigh-bells, January came in I 
His eyebrows were frosty, and just at his nose 
A drop like a gem to an icicle froze. 
Yet merry was he, and his jests flew about ; 
Wherever he moved you might know by the shout, 
Gold pippins he threw at the feet of the guests, 
And filberts and walnuts were cracked with his jests.

The Feast of the Months continuecL 


Then, swift as a messenger sent by the fates, 


February came gracefully darting on skates. 


Gray fringes of moss his white ermine array'd, 


With the verdant Bartramia richly inlaid. 


Nor were mental resources for pleasure forsook, 


For there peeped from his mantle a new-published book, 


His elegant literature wiled off the time, 


'Mid the treasures of prose, and the glories of rhyme.

The Feast of the Months continued. 


Stern March was announced by a drear, whistling blast 


That shook the smooth locks of the girls as he passed. 


" He might have been graceful," 't was whispering said. 


" But for struggling to fasten his hat on his head." 


A mingled expression appeared on his face, 


That gave it a tone between scorn and grimace, 


And when he attempted to bow to a belle. 


One would think that an ague-fit over her fell.

The Feast of the Months continued. 


Then followed young April, the daughter of Spring, 


"While a few scatter'd songsters attempted to sing. 


And the frogs breaking in lent a few comic notes, 


From a badly-tuned instrument wedged in their throats. 


Her garments were dripping, as wet from a shower, 


And her fingers clasped lightly a half-blossom'd flower ; 


And where the light print of her foot-step was seen. 


Sprang up the faint line of a beautiful green.

The Feast of the Months continued. 




Then came gentle May, and a delicate doubt 




From her eyes m bewildering sweetness looked out ; 




Nor found she her place, though, in order to know it, 




She had studied the praises of many a poet. 




A few petals oped as she glided along. 




And a few April birds warbled louder in song; 




But March was too near, and he chilled her again, 




And hushed into silence the sweet songster's strain.

, But list, through the air what a musical shout ! 


And see how the roses come clustering out ! 


And glance at the skies, where a heavenly blue

Trips cheerfully on with her flower-crown'd girls ; 


The meadows in verdure look up at her tread, 


And the wdngs of the south-wind in beauty are spread.

Now lan^idly drooping her full, droAvsy eye, 




With graceful luxuriance, approaches July. 




The frail summer insect is glad as she passes,

Till the wild thunder-peal murmurs into repose, 




And the rainbow encircles her elegant head, 




"While the turf bends in diamonds that glow at her tread.

Now noble-browed August steps featly along, 

With a train of young reapers, 'mid dances and song. 

Full laden with presents of fruits and of flowers, 

He gladdens the months in their festival hours. 

His scythe is at rest, and the laboring sun 

Looks calmly athwart the long work he has done ; 

In his golden-skied twiKght birds chant their late strain, 

And bright fire-flies float o'er his star-lighted plain.

September soon follows, the wealthiest child 

That Nature has nourished by garden or wild ; 

With still ampler presents of fruitage and grain, 

The produce of hill-side, and meadow, and plain. 

His full hazel eye seems in fondness to melt, 

And his bronz'd cheek is flushed where the sun-beam has 

And he stands like a tree in its ripeness and glow, [dwelt ; 

When the breezes and sunshine all over it go.

But October, October, so queenly and bold. 


With richly- wrought mantle of crimson and gold. 


Comes gracefully forward, her bountiful hand 


Still painting with beauty and bliss all the land.

As if daring the blast, and the gathering snow. 


That lingers afar over mountain and hill, 


To check the low song of the summer-lov'd rill.

Nobemfter, 



The Feast of the Months continued. 



November, the gentle misanthrope, is here, 

To whom the first sigh of the Autumn is dear. 

He loves the lone wood, where the strong-mingled dies 

Of the frost-tinted leaf flutters bright, and he lies 

In musing abstraction by river and grove, 

To whisper to Nature his breathings of love, 

And to take his last gaze at the funeral pyres, 

Where 'mid glory and beauty she nobly expires. 



Day of month and week.

THE LADY S ANNUAL REGISTER. 



iBccemticr. 

The Feast of the Months continued. 

Last comes Miss December, who sometime delayed 
To call her cosmetics and charms to her aid — 
The rouge to her cheek, and the curls to her hair, 
And the powder laid on with a vigilant care. 
In vain, Miss December ! A natural face, 
The soft waving line of a natural grace 
Will touch with its magical force every heart, 
While you with cosmetics are barbing your dart.

THE lady's annual REGISTER. 
The Feast of ihe Monihs concluded.

The gala passed off with an elegant gout^ 

With speeches and toasting, and songs not a few ; 

Good-humor prevailed through the festival greeting, 

And I learn'd from a i^uest 'twas a Temperance Meeting. 



JANUARY. 




Xorti)crn ©^actrcix (Jralentrav. 

The flowers and fruits of mind must be cultivated this 
month. It were indeed a shame, while Nature works in 
silence under her snow covering, that man should be idle. 
But something can be done by the lover of plants, even at 
this dreary season, to enliven the domestic scene with natu- 
ral productions. If bulbs have been planted in November, 
they will afford blossoms for the winter, if taken in before 
the severe frosts, and turned to the sunshine at the windows. 
The pretty iris Persica, hyacinths, and the common jonquil 
will give a brightness to your parlor. Strew rice, oats, flax,

or any grain of this description, on cotton, in a glass vase or 
tumbler, and the effect, as they grow, will be very agreeable 
in contrast to the leafless trees without. Be prepared for 
the blight of delicate green-house plants, which you have 
nursed at your fireside ; and do not be disconcerted. Re- 
member that the loss of a plant is a slight evil compared 
with the absence of your cheerful smile at this dreary sea- 
son. It is well to keep choice carnations housed.

Kitchen Garden. This is a busy time for the southern 
gardener, and trouble is well repaid by judicious man- 
agement. A kitchen-garden often falls under the direc- 
tion of a housewife. Sow early hotspur peas in a warm 
spot. Sow charleton, golden, and Essex, ditto ; also, mar- 
rowfat, which will succeed in bearing as the others go off. 
The mazagon, long-podded, and Windsor bean, if planted 
together, will succeed one another in bearing. Any time 
this month, sow early York, sugar-loaf, and drum-head 
cabbage-seed, for summer use, in a warm border under a 
fence. Cover up with straw, if severe weather set in. 
Transplant those sown in October and November, if not 
not already done. Cauliflowers : protect from frost, and 
transplant in a warm situation. Broccoli : hoe it. End of 
the month, sow a few Dutch turnips ; beets, ditto. Latter 
end of the month, sow a few early carrots. Hoe onions, 
Sow a little spinage for early use. Sow parsley ; the 
curled leaf is prettier and best. Transplant lettuce. On a 
dry day, earth up your celery. Endive: prepare for blanch- 
ing, for sallads, soups, &c. If garlic or shallots are not

planted, see to it. Sow radishes any time this month. If 
the weather prove frosty, spread straw or Utter over the sur- 
face of the beds. If artichokes are not dressed, let it be 
done ; also, asparagus. Set out horseradish cuttings. 

Fruit Garden, Shrubs, and Flowers. Prune peach, nec- 
tarine, and apricot trees, flowers, «Scc. Transplant any kind 
of fruit trees, except orange and fig. Plant out rose trees 
and flowering shrubs. Prune and plant raspberries. Gera- 
niums are propagated from cuttings, all but the apple, which 
grows from the seed only. They may be cut and planted 
in pots from September to June. If planted in gardens, 
they will die to the roots in winter, and spring up luxuri- 
antly in spring. 

The Kitchen. Let us look into the kitchen ; we need not 
be ashamed of the place to which Franklin has led the way. 
^VTiat a contrast between the kitchen of modern times and 
that of the period when King Alfred baked his cake on a 
wooden board ! Kitchen utensils have fast accumulated, 
and dressers and closets are crowded with forms that would 
puzzle a mathematician. This was the natural consequence 
of the restless ingenuity of civilized life until the present 
philosophy of mechanics was attained, by which cooking 
and washing are reduced to the most simple forms. Among 
the most admirable inventions for cooking are the cooking- 
stoves of Dutcher, Rathburn, AVhitney, James, and the Ro- 
tary stove — the prices of which vary from twenty to forty 
dollars, according to the size, and extent of apparatus ; they 
can be obtained in any of the principal cities ; — and for 
washing, the invention of Davidson is the best we have 
seen — -the price of which is about ten dollars ; to be had at 
the agricultural warehouse, Boston. With either of these 



28 THE lady's annual register. 

cooking-stoves, even the mother of a family in delicate 
health need not fear the overwhelming warmth which has 
heretofore driven her from the kitchen ; and her fair daugh- 
ters can prepare the most elaborate cookery without injuring 
their complexions. One of the great charms of these in- 
ventions is the air of neatness they throw around a kitchen ; 
yet the housekeeper must daily carefully inspect the vessels 
in the cooking-stove, because their very compactness will 
render them liable to be more offensive if unclean. 

Let the first walk of the housewife after breakfast be — 
not to her boudoir or to her library, but — to the kitchen. 
The certain recurrence of this visit, will stimulate her cook 
to neatness and activity. She must look under dressers, 
into closets, overhaul soiled towels, enter into the mysteries 
of wash-tubs and the gloomy caverns of iron pots and ket- 
tles. In the northern States, this is comparatively easy — 
the kitchen being under the same roof. At the south, it re- 
quires great energy, as she is exposed to cold and heat in 
passing through the open air to the servants' apartments ; 
but the southern lady, who would be sure that all is well, 
must not shrink from this duty. 



Mrs. Child's Recipe for Chicken Pie. — A nice way of 
serving up cold chicken, or pieces of cold fresh meat, is to 
make them into a meat pie. The gizzards, livers, and necks 
of poultry parboiled, are good for the same purpose. But 
many people prefer parboiling the liver and gizzard, and 
cutting it up very fine to be put into the gTavy while the 
fowls are cooking ; in this case, the water they are boiled in 
should be used to make the gra\y. If you wish to bake 
your meat pie, line a deep earthen or tin pan with paste 
made of flour, cold water, and lard ; use but little lard, for 



THE lady's annual REGISTER. 29 

the fat of the meat will shorten the crust. Lay in your bits 
of meat, or chicken, with two or three slices of salt pork ; 
place a few thin slices of your paste here and there ; drop 
in an egg, if you have plenty. Fill the pan with flour and 
water, seasoned with a little pepper and salt. If the meat 
be very lean, put in a piece of butter, or such sweet gravies 
as you may happen to have. Cover the top with crust, and 
put it in the oven, or bake-kettle, to cook from tAventy min- 
utes to one hour, according to the size of the pie. Some peo- 
ple think this the nicest way of cooking whole chickens. 
When thus cooked, they should be parboiled before they are 
put into the pan, and the w^ater they are boiled in should be 
added. They need to be baked fifteen minutes longer than 
meat previously cooked. 



ANE CDOTES. 

A very plain man was acting the character of Mithridates 
in a French theatre, when Monima said to him, ' My lord, 
you change countenance ; ' a young fellow in the pit cried, 
' For heaven's sake let him.' 

A gentleman seeing a woman skinning some eels, said to 
her, ' how can you bear to be so cruel ? do n't you think you 
put them to a great deal of pain ? ' ' Why, I might, sir,' 
she replied, ' when I first began the business ; but I have 
dealt in them twenty years, and by this time they must be 
quite used to it.' 

A gentleman who had been desired by his wife to make a 
purchase for her at a milliner's, being invited by a friend on 
his return to call in, begged to be excused from stopping, as 
he had bought a bonnet for his wife, and was afraid the 
fashion would alter before he got home. 

A stone mason was employed to engrave the following 



30 THE lady's annual REGISTER. 

epitaph on a tradesman's wife : ' A virtuous woman is a 
crown to her husband.' The stone, however, being narrow, 
he contracted the sentence in the following manner : ' A vir- 
tuous woman is 5s. to her husband.' 

A bricklayer fell through the rafters of an unfinished 
house, and nearly killed himself; a bystander declared that 
he ought to be employed, as he went through his work. 

Dr. Brown courted a lady for many years unsuccessfully ; 
during which time he had always accustomed himself to 
propose her health, whenever he was called upon for a lady. 
But being observed one evening to omit it, a gentleman re- 
minded him that he had forgotten to toast his favorite lady. 
' Why, indeed,' said the doctor, ' I find it all in vain ; I have 
toasted her so many years, and cannot make her Brown, 
that I am determined to toast her no longer.' 



THE merchant's BRIDE. 

A Ballad. —By Caroline Gilman. 

PART I. 

Before the priest young Julia stood 

A bright and buoyant maid, 
Scarce conscious of the winning charm 

Each act and look betrayed. 

Her pure white robe, with graceful fold, 

And floating veil descend, 
While costly flowers from distant climes 

With costly jew^els blend. 

Pearls tremble on her lovely brow, 
And clasp her swan-like neck, 

And glittering diamonds, rich and rare, 
Her slender fingers deck. 



THE lady's annual REGISTER. 31 

And he who gave this lavish store, 

Gazes upon his prize, 
Forgetful of the diamond's blaze 

While looking in her eyes. 

For there, confiding tenderness 

And maiden sweetness dwell, 
Blent with a soft unconsciousness, 

To man the fondest spell. 

And freely now her hand in his 

She lays — a wedded wife 5 
And cheerfully the promise gives 

To be his own for life. 

Oh, sw-eetly hath he deck'd her bower, 

And gorgeously her halls : 
Here treads her foot on springing buds, 

And there on velvet falls. 

The massy curtain's graceful flow, 

The vase — the painting warm — 
Those household echoes — mirrors bright. 

Revealing her light form, — 

Exotics that perfume the air 

With odors sweet and strange, 
And shells that far in distant climes 

'Mid ocean-wonders range, — 

With countless gifts of taste and art, 

In classic beauty rife, 
Are laid upon aflection's shrine 

Before that youthful wife. 

The ocean deep, the circling air. 

The earth for her is sought. 
And ere she breathes a prayer or wish. 

Possession follows thought. 



32 THE lady's annual register. 

Nor scarcely on her silken cheek 
May glance the summer ray ; 

And costly furs enfold her form 
"When A\inter holds his sway. 

Why should he toil at early morn, 
And freight the frequent sail, 

While still unsated, gathering night 
Finds him with vigil pale ? 

Alas ! each day subtracts some tint 
From home's delicious bloom. 

How soon neglect destroys that plant 
Of d^icate perfume ! 

And lonely walks she in her bower, 
And lonely in her hall, 

And thinks one day-caress from him 
Were fairly worth them all. 

She pauses at the mirror now, 
Still speaks its flattering tone, — 

But with a sigh she droops her head. 
And feels herself alone. 

Her fingers on the ivory keys 
Run on in listless play, — 

' What care I for the foolish song ? ' 
She asks, and turns away. 

Yet still he labors. When within 
The whirlpool-stream of gain, 

Man strives to reach the table-land 
Of calm content in vain. 

Amid his leger's crowded leaves 
Once thought he but of her, 

Alas ! for mammon now he toils, 
His hourly worshipper. 



THE LADY S ANNUAL REGISTER. 

The silent meal, the hurried walk, 
The news conn'd o'er and o'er, 

Betray a mind that beats to home's 
Fresh sympathies no more. 

And when he hears the fretful word, 

Or sees the struggling tear. 
He looks around his rich abode, 

And asks, ' "What want is here ? ' 

Who does not know that one kind tone 

Is more to woman's heart 
Than all the gauds of wealth and power 

Mere riches can impart ? 

Yet often to some wild abyss 
The coursing streamlet tends, 

And 'mid the rays of gorgeous clouds 
The lightning's flash descends. 

One morn the merchant counts his gains - 
In conscious wealth he trod — 

The next he stood a beggar'd man, 
Nor owned his burial sod. 

Dizzy he turned — and as a ship 

Its guiding rudder lost. 
Drifts on the sea, so wandered he, 

By rushing eddies tost. 

And where is Julia, where the flower 

So delicately bred, 
"When this rough storm of fortune's gale 

Came bursting on her head ? 

Strangers were seen in those gay halls, - 

And idle loungers there. 
In careless wonder, curious gazed 

On objects loved and rare.

The auctioneer rang out his jest, 

The hammer's stroke was hearS, 
And laugh on laugh went grating round, 
As fell each idle word. 

The mirrors which had multiplied 

So oft her loveliness. 
The vases which with clustering flowers 

Her hands had joyed to dress, — 

Books, which her jewelled fingers turned 
With gay or studious eye. 

Sofas where oft luxuriously 
Her form was wont to lie, — 

Sweet monuments of taste and love — 
All broke like ocean's foam ; 

She turned in sorrow from the spot 
To seek another home. 



Who sits beside yon coz}- fire, 

A babe upon her knee ? 
And who is clasping that sweet pair 

Fondly and cheerfully ? 

The space is small, but there is room 

For Rover at their feet. 
The tea-urn gives its hissing sound, 

The bread is white and sweet. 

Blethinks I 've seen that full clear eye 
Less brilliant in its beams, 

And that elastic, graceful step. 
Graver than now it seems. 

List to that laugh of heartfelt mirth, 
List to that tender word, 



THE lady's annual REGISTER. 35 

And see the frequent chaste caress 
From sympathy new-stirr'd ! 

Oh, Julia, in misfortune's scale 

Thy worth has \rell been tried, 
And thou art happy, for thy lord 

Is happy at thy side. 

Awakened from his worldly dream 

Absorbing, selfish, vain. 
He finds the path to happiness 

Lies not in ceaseless gain. 

In unaspiring competence 

He seeks the golden mean, 
Contented in life's calmer fields 

His needful wants to glean. 

And Julia walks in dignity, 

A heaven-relying mind 
Enkindling up a latent power 

Scarcely before defined. 

More beautiful the merchant's bride 

Thus school'd to self-control. 
Than when light winds of pleasure flew 

Across her passive soul. 

Oh, who shall call adversity 

A dark and cheerless night, 
When on her brow such stars appear 

Of calm and lovely light ?

THE MOTHER AND HER CHILD. 

From Georgia Scenes. — By a native Georgian. 

Whence comes the gibberish which is almost invariably 
used by mothers and nurses to infants ? Take for example 
the following, which will answer the two-fold purpose of 
illustrating my idea, and of exhibiting one of the peculiari- 
ties of the age. 

A few days ago, I called to spend an hour in the after- 
noon with Mr. Slang, whose wife was the mother of a child 
about eight months old. 

While I was there, the child in the nurse's arms, in an 
adjoining room, began to cry. 

' You Rose,' said Mrs. Slang, ' quiet that child I ' Rose 
walked it, and sang to it ; but it did not hush. 

' You Rose ! if you do not quiet that child, I lay I make 
you.' 

' I is tried, ma'am,' said Rose, ' an' he would n't get 
hush'd.' {Child cries louder.) 

' Fetch him here to me, you good-for-nothing hussey, you. 
What 's the matter with him ! ' reaching out her arms to re- 
ceive him. 

' I dun know, ma'am.' 

' Nhei — nhun — nho — nha'am ! ' {mocking and grin7iing 
at Rose.) 

As Rose delivered the child, she gave visible signs of 
dodging, just as the child left her arms ; and, that she might 
not be disappointed, Mrs. Slang gave her a box : in which 
there seemed to be no anger mixed at all ; and which Rose 
received as a matter of course, without even changing coun- 
tenance under it. 

' Da den ! ' said Mrs. Slang ; * come elong e muddy,

chilluns ? ' (children) — pressing the child to her bosom, and 
rocking it backward and forward, tenderly. ' Muddins will 
whippy ole nassy Yosey. Ah! you old uggy Yosey,' 
{knocking at Rose, playfully.) ' Da den ; muddy did whip 
bad Yosey.' 

{Child continues crying.) 

'Why, what upon earth ails the child? Rose, you've 
hurt this child, somehow.' 

' No m'm, 'cla' I did n't ; I was jis sitt'n down dar in the 
rock'n chair long side o' Miss Nancy's bureau, an' want 
doin' nothin' 't all to him, jis playin' wid him, an' he jis 'gin

' Nhing — nhing — nhing — and I expect you hit his head

' Let muddy see where ole bad Yosey knock}^ heady 'gin

and finding nothing. 

( Child cries on.

rolls over, kicks, and screams worse than ever.) 

'Hush! you little brat! I believe it's nothing in the 
world but crossness. Hush! {shaking it) hush, I tell you.' 
{Child cries to the ne plus ultra.) 

' Why, surely a pin must stick the child. Yes, was e bad 
pin did ticky chilluns? Let muddy see where de uggy 
pin did ticky dear precious creter,' — {examining.) 'Why

no, it isn't a pin. Why, what can be the matter ^Yith the 
child ! It nuist have the cholic, surely. Rose, go brmg me 
the paregoric off the mantelpiece. Yes, muddy's baby did 
hab e tohc. Dat was what did ail muddy's precious darly 
baby.' [Pressiyig it to her bosom and rocking it. Child 

cries on.) 

Rose brought the paregoric, handed it, dodged, and got 

her expectations reaUzed as before. 

' Now go bring me the sugar and some water.' 
Rose brought them, and delivered both without the cus- 
tomary reward ; for at that instant the child being laid per- 
fectly still on the lap, hushed. 

The paregoric was administered, and the child received it 
with only a whimper now and then. As soon as it received 
the medicine, the mother raised it up, and it began to cry. 

' Why, Lord help my soul ! what 's the matter with the 
child ? 4hat have you done to him, you little hussy ? ' 
[rising and walking towards Eose.) 

"Cla' Missis, I eint done nothin' 'tall — was jis sittin' 

dowai da by Miss Nancy's bu ' 

' You lie, you slut,' {hitting her a passing slap ;) ' I know 
you have hurt him. Hush, my baby,' [singing the Coquet) 
' don't you cry, your sweet-heari will come by'm'by ; da, de 
dum dum dum da, da de dum diddle dum da.' [Child cries 
on.) ' Lord help my soul ! what can be the matter with my 
baby ! ' [tears coming in her own eyes.) ' Something 's the 
matter with it ; [laying the child on her lap, and feeling its 
arms to see whether it flinched at the touch (^ any particular 
part.) But the child cried less while she was feeling it 
than before. 

' Yes, dat was it ; wanted litty arms pibb'd. Mud will 

yub its sweet yitty arms.' 
[Child begins again.) 



39 

' What upon earth can make my baby cry so ! ' rising and 
walking to the window. ( Stops at the window , and the child 
hushes.) 

' Yes, dat was it ; did want to look out 'e windys. See 
the petty chickens. 0-o-o-h ! Look at the beauty rooster ! 
Yonder 's old aunt Betty ! See old aunt Betty, pickin' up 
chips. Yes, ole aunt Betty, pickin' up chip fo' bake bicky 
(biscuit) fo' good chilluns. Good aunt Betty, fo' make bicky 
fo' sweet baby's supper.' 

{Child begins again.) 

' Hoo-o-o ! see de windy ! ' {knocking on the ivindow ; 
child screams.) 

' You Rose, what have you done to this child ? You 
little hussy you, if you don't tell me how you hurt him, 
I '11 whip you as long as I can find you.' 

' Missis, I 'cla' I never done noth'n 't all to him, I was 
jis sett'n' down da by Miss Nancy's bu ' 

' If you say Miss Na7icy's bureau, to me again, I '11 stuff 
Miss Nancy's bureau down your throat, you lying slut. 
I 'm just as sure you have hurt him, as if I 'd seen you. 
How did you hurt him ? ' 

Here Rose was reduced to a non plus ; for, upon the peril 
of having a bureau stuffed down her throat, she dared not 
repeat the oft-told tale, and she knew no other. She there- 
fore stood mute. 

' Julia,' said Mr. Slang, ' bring the child to me, and let me 
see if I can discover the cause of his crying.' 

Mr. Slang took the child, and commenced a careful exam- 
ination of it. He removed the cap, and beginning at the 
crown of its head, extended the search slowly and cau- 
tiously downward, accompanying the eye with the touch of 
the finger. He had not proceeded far in this way, before he 
discovered in the ris^ht ear of the child a small feather, the

cause, of course, of all its wailing. The cause removed, 
the child soon changed its tears to smiles, greatly to the de- 
light of all, and to none more than Rose. 



THE NEW YEAR. 

' The solemn and melancholy truth of the shortness of 
time, is pressed upon us by a vast variety of experience. 
We find ourselves rapidly and imperceptibly hurried along 
from period to period, as by some invisible, irresistible power. 
The year, to which we once looked forward as to some 
strange, far-off, unapproachable limit of time, at length comes 
round, and we write and pronounce its name with all the fa- 
miliarity and ease that we have shown to those gone by. 
The age of twenty, thirty, forty, fifty years, was once antici- 
pated by our youthful imaginations as something that could 
hardly happen to us ; but before we are aware of it, we find 
ourselves at those several landing-places, and sailing again 
forward on the trackless stream to reach the next, the next, 
and the next, as soon. Thus, in the several dates through 
which we are borne, it is but too lamentable that the time is 
short. Equally so is it in the changes which take place in 
our bodily and mental frames. The vivacity of youth gives 
way to the steady strength of middle age ; and the strength 
of middle age is displaced by the tottering infirmities of de- 
cline. The rose that paints the cheek fades soon away ; the 
eye which was bright and alive, grows speedily dim ; the 
hand which was nerved with energy, unexpectedly trembles ; 
the lungs that were free and strong, now pant with exertion. 
Nothing stays ; nothing is ours ; we hardly know ourselves ; 
our characters change ; we have gained views, and feelings, 
and habits, which we scarcely know how we have acquired ; 



THE lady's annual REGISTER. 41 

what -we ardently hoped and longed for, has come, and is 
gone ; strange and unthought-of experiences have passed 
over our heads ; our memories turn back upon great chasms, 
where they find nothing remaining of those hopes and fears, 
those pains and enjoyments, those thoughts and sensations, 
which in their turns have filled and agitated our bosoms. 
We cannot say what we have done, and where we have 
been. We cannot tell how w^e came here. Great God ! 
what is it that has thro^vn us all so unexpectedly down at 
this point of time, in the midst of so many dangers and fa- 
talities that press upon every side of us ? When w^e re- 
cover from our confusion and astonishment, and think where 
we are, we can only make one reflection before we rush for- 
ward again on another career. One reflection — the time is 
short — the time is mysteriously, unaccountably, and fear- 
fully short ! 

' The time is short ; but eternity is long ! Yet we have 
time enough to prepare for eternity. Let us faithfully drop 
the seed, and water it, and nourish it here. It is true that 
darkness hovers over the result. Yet hope, and faith, and 
reason, and the promises of God, shall carry our confident 
expectations forward to skies where the sun goes not down, 
and to years which never decay.' 



IT SNOWS . 

By Mrs. Sarah J. Hale. 

' It snows ! ' cried the school-boy — ' hurrah ! ' and his shout 

Is ringing through parlor and hall, 
While swift, as the mng of a swallow, he's out, 

And his pla5anates have answered his call : 
It makes the heart leap but to mtness their joy — 

Proud wealth has no pleasures, I trow, 

4* 



42 THE lady's annual register. 

Like the rapture that throbs in the pulse of the boy," 

As he gathers his treasures of snow ; 
Then lay not the trappings of gold on thine heirS; 
"While health and the riches of nature are theirs. 

' It snows ! ' sighs the imbecile — 'Ah.\' and his breath 

Comes heavy^, as clogged with a weight ; 
While from the pale aspect of Nature in death, 

He turns to the blaze of his grate ; 
And nearer, and nearer, his soft-cushioned chair 

Is wheeled tow'rds the life-giving flame — 
He dreads the chill puff of the snow-burdened air, 

Lest it wither his delicate frame : 
! small is the pleasure existence can give, 
"Wrhen the fear we shall die only proves that we live ! 

' It snows ! ' cries the traveller — ^ Ho ! ' and the word 

Has quickened his steed's lagging pace ; 
The ^\'ind rushes by, but its how^l is unheard — 

TJnfelt the sharp drift in his face : 
For bright through the tempest his own home upreared, 

Ay, though leagues intervene, he can see ; 
There 's the clear, glowing hearth, and the table prepared, 

And his wife with their babes at her knee. 
Blest thought ! how it lightens the grief-laden hour, 

That those we love best are still safe from its power. 

'It snows ! ' cries the belle — ' Dear, how lucky !' and turns 

From her mirror to watch the flakes fall : 
Like the first rose of summer, her dimpled cheek burns 

While musing on sleigh-ride and ball : 
There are visions of conquests, of spendor, and mirth. 

Floating over each drear winter's day ; 
But the tintings of hope, on this snow-beaten earth, 

Will melt, like the snow-flakes, away : 
Turn, turn thee to Heaven, fair maiden, for bliss. 
That world has a pure fount ne'er opened in this.

'■ It sno"ws ! ' cries the w-idow — ' Oh, God ! ' and her sighs 

Have stifled the voice of her prayer ; 
Its burthen je 'U read in her tear-swollen eyes, 

On her cheek, sunk with fasting and care. 
"T is night — and her fatherless ask her for bread — 

But ' He gives e'en the ravens their food,' 
And she trusts, till her dark hearth adds horror to dread. 

And she lays on her last chip of wood. 
Poor sulTerer ! that sorrow thy God only knows — 
• T is a most bitter lot to be poor, when it snows !

FEBRUARY. 




Xort!)crn C^artren ^alentiar. 

There is still a blank over the face of nature without ; but 
you can ornament your in-door plants with beautiful mosses. 
On some sunny day, the woods, though apparently barren, 
will yield you a soft, green gift, bright as sunmier verdure. 



Soutljern ©fartren ©aletiirar. 



Kitchen Garden. Plant beans of any kind. Sow peas, 
of various kinds, once a fortnight, and you will have a con- 
stant succession for your table. Transplant cabbage-plants 
of all kinds, if not already done. If your cauliflowers so^^^l 
in October are not planted out, attend to it now. Transplant 
lettuce, and plant for a general crop at times, through the 
month. Sow spinage every fortnight or three weeks. On- 
ions and leeks — sow for a general crop ; hoe those which 



46 THE lady's annual register. 

are transplanted. Sow radish seeds, and water early crops. 
Sow carrots and parsnips ; they will be fit for use from May 
lo August. Cresses, mustard, radish, rape, &c. : sow once 
a fortnight or less ; also chervil and coriander. Sow pars- 
ley, if not attended to ; also basil. Pot and medicinal herbs, 
as dill, fennel, borage, burnet, bugloss, sorrel, marigold, ora- 
cle, clarey, &c., maybe sown any time this month. Hyssop, 
th^TTie, savory, and sweet marjoram, rather at the beginning. 
Plant slips of sage, hyssop, thyme, and savory. Plant slips 
of rosemary, rue, wormwood, and lavender, six inches asun- 
der, in shade. All these plants must come from the last 
year's stock. Now is the time for planting mint. Plant as- 
paragus roots all this month, and sow seed. Dress arti- 
chokes, and sow seed. Plant Irish potatoes any time this 
month. Sow turnips for full crop. 

Fruits, Shi'ubs, and Flowers. Prune plum and cherry 
trees, if not done before ; also peach, nectarine, and apricot. 
Vines must not be neglected any longer, nor raspberries. 
Give strawberries their spring dressing. You may plant, 
but September and October are a better time. Fruit trees, 
of all sorts, may be planted this month. About the middle 
of this month, prune fig trees. Transplant orange trees ; 
also lemon and lime. Prune, also. Head down young 
trees. Plant hops. Sow china-asters and lupines, and shel- 
ter them. Sow snail flowers in a box. Sow hollyhocks in 
the garden. Plant geraniums as in January. 



Ironing. There are few families, rich or poor, who do 
not use flat (smoothing) irons ; and it is odd to see the ex- 
pedients resorted to in order to get up the apparatus where 
there is not a proper system. Miss Sarah Clewloch runs to 



THE lady's A^"^'UAL EEGISTER. 47 

her bed, and dravx'S off a rose-blanket, worth several dollars, 
to iron a piece of old muslin or faded ribbon ; and for want 
of a ring on which to rest her iron, leaves its triangiilar 
scorches in divers places. Mrs. IvI'Kimblock performs the 
same exploit on a good flannel petticoat. The Misses Rud- 
gill have spoiled a set of their mother's cup-towels, by- 
snatching them up for iron-holders. Miss Liddon left the 
smooch of her soiled iron on a French cape worth fifteen 
dollars, for want of a wiper ; and her father, vv'ho never 
swore before, came out with an oath as he took seven neck- 
cloths out of his drawer, with corresponding insignia, on 
the same account. Miss Angehna Fairfax was reduced to 
placing one of her mother's best sheets on a kitchen table, 
used for pastry, when about to iron a silk dress in haste ; 
the consequence was, that the grease oozed through abund- 
antly, and in her agitation she broke a French gilt saucer, 
on which she had rested her iron. Miss Alkali never gives 
a direction or lends a hand to the sweeping of the hearth 
before ironing. The ashes adhere to the iron-holder and 
strewed in unseemly quantities over the damp clothes. 
One fearful consequence of this carelessness was, that an 
enamored youth, peeping one day into the window to get a 
glance of her on the way from his store, saw the white 
starched plaits of her brother's shirts discolored by the iron 
she was wielding. Shocked to the heart by this careless- 
ness, he laid his hand on his breast, or rather on his shirt- 
bosom, and protested that thereafter his attention should be 
given to her opposite neighbor. 

Very different is the deportment of Mrs. Caststeel, who, 
by a little forethought, goes along in this department as 
smoothly as one of her own irons. Her kitchen ironing 
establishment is entirely distinct from that used in occasional 
jobs by the family. She provides a large clean board to fit 



4S THE lady's annual REGISTER. 

on the table that stands in the kitchen, which is placed out 
of the way when not in use. Her ironing-cloth is of double 
white plains, or a coarse blanket with white cloth over it. 
Her holders are of old cloth folded and stitched to the proper 
size ; even her wipers she thinks it expedient to sew in a 
form which may show that they are not rags. She has an 
iron ring to rest her hot iron on, and a piece of beeswax, 
which will cleanse a hot iron admirably, if just touched to 
it and instantly rubbed off. These articles are kept in a 
bag and hung up in some convenient place. Each of her 
grown-up daughters (I think there are seven) keeps an es- 
tablishment of her own ; a bag, with the articles described, 
and a small board to lie in the lap or place on a table for 
pressing out muslins, &c. ; therefore are the Misses Cast- 
steel never seen in undignified anxiety about these necessary 
articles, and therefore is it probable that they will not lose 
an incipient sweetheart by their carelessness. 



From the New-Enjland Farmer. 

Raising ChicJcens. — I keep my hens warm under cover during the 
winter, and feed them on ' Brewer's Grains,' placed in an open box 
or tub, that they may eat when they please, occasionally giving them 
oats, corn, and oyster shells pounded fine, and plenty of water ; by 
keeping them warm and well fed, they begin laying earlier in the 
season. I prefer spring chickens, as they lay earlier than old hens ; 
and the old hens to set, as they make the best mothers. I take care 
the eggs do not get chilled with cold, and keep them in a warm 
place in my house. When three or four hens want to set, I put from 
thirteen to fifteen eggs under each of them, according to size — the 
day of the month marked on each egg — and after the hen has set a 
week or ten days, I examine them by holding the eggs to a crack or 
knot-hole in a board when the sun shines through, and if I discover 
any rotten ones, I take them away and replace them with fresh ones 
marked as before mentioned. When the chickens are all hatched, I 



THE lady's annual REGISTER. 49 

put two or three broods to one hen, in a coop with an opening against 
an empty barrel placed on the bilge ; and with a little care, when put 
in the coop, the hen may be made to brood them at the further end 
of the barrel. In that way, the chickens that are not covered by the 
hen huddle together around her and keep each other warm. The 
hens from which the chickens are taken I put into another coop, and 
in about a fortnight they will begin to lay again. The hen being 
confined in the coop, will leave her chickens much earlier than if left 
to run at large with them ; and the chickens will become so accus- 
tomed to going into the barrel and huddling together, as to be quite 
contented to give up the hen's brooding them. After the chickens are 
two or three weeks old, I remove them with the coops into my gar- 
den, where they feed upon insects, so as to require but little food — 
but do not keep them there until they are large enough to injure the 
garden. 

I feel persuaded that in the way I have proceeded, our market 
could be supplied with an abundance of poultry ; and I recommend 
it with confidence, if managed with care and attention, as profitable 
to those who may engage in such business. 



SIMPLE REJ.IEDIES. 

From Mrs. Child, and other sources. 

Mustard m.ixed in the usual way, and taken into the stomach, is 
the speediest emetic; and is of singular use in ejecting poisonous 
substances from the stomach, if resorted to immediately. So simple 
a remedy ought to be knowTi by every one. 

Cotton wet with sweet oil and paragoric, relieves the earache 
very soon. The negroes, at the south, consider a cockroach, cut in 
two and applied to the ear, the most certain cure for the earache. 

A good quantity of old cheese is the best thing to eat when dis- 
tressed by eating too much fruit, or oppressed with any kind of food. 
Physicians have given it in cases of extreme danger. 

Honey and milk is very good for worms ; so is strong salt water ; 
like\vase powdered sage and molasses, taken freely. 

For a sudden attack of quincy, or croup, bathe the neck with bear's 



50 THE lady's annual REGISTER. 

grease, and pour it do^m the throat. A linen rag soaked in sweet 
oil, butter, or lard, and sprinkled with yellow Scotch snuff, is said to 
have performed wonderful cures in cases of croup : it should be 
placed where the distress is greatest. 
Cotton and oil, are the best things for a burn. 
A poultice of wheat-bran, or rye-bran, and vinegar, very soon 
takes down the inflammation occasioned by a sprain. 

A rind of pork bound upon a wound occasioned by a needle, pin, 
or nail, prevents the lock-jaw. It should be always applied. 

If you happen to cut yourself slightly while cooking, bind on some 
fine salt. Molasses is likewise good. 

Black or green tea, steeped in boiling milk, is excellent for the dys- 
entery. Cork, burnt to charcoal, about as big as a hazle-nut, mace- 
rated, and put in a teaspoonful of brandy, with a little loaf-sugar and 
nutmeg, is very efficacious in cases of dysentery and cholera-morbus. 
If nutmeg be wanting, peppermint may be used. Flannel, wet mth 
brandy, powdered with cayenne pepper, and laid upon the bowels, 
affords great relief in cases of extreme distress. 

Whortleberries, commonly called huckleberries, dried, are a useful 
medicine for children. Made into tea and sweetened with molasses, 
they are very beneficial when the system is m a restricted state, and 
the digestive powers out of order. 

In case of any scratch or wound, from which the lockjaw is ap- 
prehended, bathe the injured part freely with lye, or pearlash and 
water. 

Loaf-sugar and brandy relieve a sore throat ; when very bad, it is 
good to inhale the steam of scalding hot vinegar through the tube of 
a tunnel. 

An ointment made from the common ground-worms, which boys 
dig to bait fishes, rubbed on with the hand, is said to be excellent, 
when the sinews are drawn up by any disease or accident. 



ANECDOTES. 

Judge Jeffries, of notorious memory, (pointing to a man with his 
cane, who was about to be tried) said, ' There is a great rogue at 



THE lady's annual REGISTER. 51 

the end of my cane.' The man to whom he pointed, looked at him 
and said, 'Which end, my lord?' 

Rebuke. — A buck, with a cigar (a Jongyiine, of course) in his 
mouth, entered Mr. Cross's menagerie recently in Philadelphia, when 
Mr. Cross requested the visiter to take the ' weed ' from his mouth, 
lest he should learn the monkeys bad habits. 

An Irish sergeant, on a march, being attacked by a dog, pierced 
the animal with his halbert. On the complaint of the owner, the su- 
perior officer said to the offender, ' Murphy, you were wrong in this. 
You should have struck the dog -with the butt end of your halbert, 
and not with your blade.' ' Plaise your honor,' says Murphy, ' and 
I would have been glad for to save myself the trouble of claining my^ 
iron, if he had only been so kind as to bite me with his tail instead 
of his teeth.' 

Jonatahan's description of a Steamboat. — 'It's got a saw-mill 
on one side, and a grist-mill on t' other, and a blacksmith's shop in 
the middle ; and dowTi cellar there 's a tarnation great pot boilin' all 
the time. 

A Coward. — 'You're a coward,' said a low Londoner to a poor 
countryman, who had refused to fight. ' No I heant,' said the coun- 
tryman, ' I have nothing to do with cows, I am a shepherd.' 

An Irish gentleman, on going to the post-office, inquired if there 
were any letters for him, as he had caused them to lie till called for. 
^ Your name, sir ? ' inquired the clerk, ' There is a good one, now ! ' 
replied the honest Hibernian ; ' why, will you not see it on the back 
pf the letter ? ' 

Correct Ans-\ver. — 'Might your name be Smith, said a lout to 

that oddest of odd fellows, , after a rap at his door loud enough 

to disturb the occupants of a church-yard. 'Yes, it might — but it 
aint, by a long chalk.'

THE BETROTHED. 

By Caroline Gilman. 

(Scene. — A Southern Plantation — J\''oon.) 



Why linger near me, Emma, with that cheek 
Which colors up in flushings like the sky 
Lit by the sinking sun ? Why from thine hand 
Falls the small needle, as e'en that were weight 



THE lady's annual REGISTER. 53 

Too large ? What mean these broken words, and sighs, 
Now passionate, then sinking down so low 
That I must bend mine ear to catch the tone ? 
Hark — is that Edgar's Step? 

EMMA. 

O, mother, dear — 

MOTHER. 

My child, my simple child, it needs not words 
To tell me now — indeed, I 've known it long. 
Think'st thou that I could see the lily's leaves 
Floating like living things upon the wave. 
And guess not that the tide did move them thus ? 
Think'st thou that when the rose's bloom is stirr'd, 
I know not that the breeze, "«"ith waving breath. 
Is sweeping o'er its rich and blushing leaves ? 
Or when the wind-harp wakes with thrilling tones, 
I know not the same breeze, kissing its strings, 
Doth call its murmurs ? Just as plain to me 
Is it, that love, my child, hath touch'd thy soul \ 
Nay, start not, Emma, 't is no sin to love. — 
But come, and lay thy head upon my breast. 
And tell me all. I ^t.11 not seek thine eyes. 
Nor pierce their sable fringe, but clasp thy hand, 
Thy fair, soft hand, whose tender pressure shall 
Speak half thy tale. 



My gentle mother, how 
Can I for any other love neglect 
Thy love ? nor did I, nor did Edgar thus ; 
And when this morn he urged his eager suit, 
Thy name was blent in fondness with my own. 

Rememberest thou — oh yes, thou never canst 
Forget the day — when, but a thoughtless girl, 
"With springing step and floating hair, I sought 
The river-bank whereon my brothers sat, 
Tlu?owlng the line to lure their watery prey ; 

* b* 



54 THE lady's annual register. 

Eager to see their prisoner caught, I lean'd 
On a young sapling with unconscious weight, 
And fell — when Edgar saw — he sprang — impetuous, 
Leap'd to the wave, and -with sustaining strength 
Upbore me till assistance came. How quick 
Is thought ! Though reeling, dizzy, just upon 
The brink of dark futurity, this hope 
Came lighting like a torch my youthful heart, 
Edgar will be mj friend! I knew not love, 
Or then perchance I might have said, my love .' 
Ere long he left us for more classic bowers ; 
But tidings often came of one, who stood 
Before his classmates with a laurel'd brow, 
Winning mth graceful ease the frequent prize. 
Nor this alone ; I heard of generous deeds 
Where the kind heart outshone the sparkling mind. 
As yon white blossoms grace the laurel-tree. 

And tokens sometimes came rememberingly, 
(Thou knowest them, mother, well) — a drawing once, 
Of a young girl just rescued from the waves. 
With eyes seal'd up like blossoms in rude storms ; 
He had not sketched her )'oung deliverer ; 
For modesty is nature in him ; but 
My vision fancied there the ardent boy, 
His chestnut curls crushed by the sweeping stream, 
His panting chest, his opening lips, his eyes 
Starting in fear, and doubt, and growing joy, 
When I unfolded mine. — Sometimes a flower 
Was sent, or leaf, gathered perchance in some 
Lone, musing hour, — or colored sea-shell, which 
In whispers to mine ear, told a soft tale 
, I whispered not again. 

Time roll'd, and he. 
That distant one, crown'd with collegiate fame, 
Returned. He sought me, mother, and this morn, 
Where the clematis-bower shuts out the sun. 
He ask'd me for my heart. — I answer'd not; 
But, mother, it was his, on that far morn 



THE lady's annual REGISTER. 55 

When shuddering from the river's depth I woke 
Within his arms. 

MOTHER. 

Thanks, love, for this fond trust. 
Oh, never should a daughter's thoughts find rest 
On kinder pillow than a mother's heart. 
But Edgar comes. — Look up and meet his smile. 

Yes, take her hand, and with it a young heart 
Full of love's first devotion. 'Tis a charge, 
My son, most precious ! When she errs, reprove, — 
Spare not deserv'd reproof; she has been train' d 
In Christ's high school, and knows that she is frail, 
And she can bear the probe when brought by love. 
But of neglect, beware ! Cherish her well 5 
For should the breath of coldness fall on her, 
Thou would'st hear no complaint, but thou would'st see 
Her sink into the grave, as the green leaves 
Shrivel and fade beneath autumnal winds. 

It is a struggle hard to bear, my son, 
When a fond mother's cherished flower is borne. 
Gently transplanted, to a happy home ; 
But deeper far than death ' s the withering pang, 
To see her sought a few short months of pride, 
Her beauties cherished and her odors prized, 
And then thrown by as lightly as the weed, 
The trampled weed, along the traveller's path. 

And, oh, bethink thee, Edgar, of her soul, 
And lead her in the heavenly road to God. 
In that great day, when mortal hearts are bare, 
Motives and deeds, before the Eternal throne, 
Beware lest I, with earnest pleading, sue 
To thee for this sweet child! Bring her to me 
A blessed spirit, wrapt in robes of grace, 
And if there 's gratitude in heavenly bowers, 
Oh, thou shalt hear its full and gushing tones 
Rise in thanksgiving from a mother's soul !

DISAPPOINTMENT. 
By Caroline Gilman. 

Mark yon rich, cloud, its hues so bright, 
Tinged with the warm sun's setting ray j 
Soon will the sable brow of night 
Scowl all those golden hues away. 

Blark j^on soft sea, its placid rest, 
The gentle curling of that wave ; 
Soon shall the pond'rous billow's breast 
Kaise on that sea a gloomy grave. 

Like these, alas, are mortal joys ! 

When in those joys we rest secure. 

Some stroke of fate the charm destroys, — 

That stroke is Heaven's — oh, hush! endure. 



THE EARTH IS BEAUTIFUL. 

By Caroline Oilman. 

The whole broad earth is beautiful 

To minds attuned aright, 
And wheresoe'er my feet are turned, 

A smile has met my sight ; 
The city, with its bustling walk. 

Its splendor, wealth, and power, 
A ramble by the river-side, 

A passing summer flower. 
The meadow green, the ocean's swell, 

The forest waving free, — 
Are gifts of God, and speak in tones 

Of kindliness to me. 
And oh ! where'er my lot is cast, 

"Where'er my footsteps roam, 
If those I love are near to me, 

That spot is still my home.

MARCH. 




Kortjcrn <*5?artren Calentiar. 



Now is the time to be overlooking garden tools, and mak- 
ing arrangements for the coming planting season, pruning 
trees, ^c. If your seeds were all properly arranged and la- 
beled, you will have little difficulty, especially if the proper 
time for planting is written on each paper. Box borders 
may be trimmed, and your beds prepared for seeds. This 
is a doubtful month, and the weather must be consulted ; but 
it will be well to get out early peas, radishes, &c., as soon as 
possible. Sow your sallads, cresses, &c., when you begin, 
once a fortnight, to have a regular succession. Look down 
cellar at cabbages, and pick out sound ones for seed and 
greens ; trim them them off to the stump in planting for 
greens. Sow tomatoes in hot-beds. 

Seeds that are long in vegetating, as the parsnip, celerj'', 
mulberr}^, &c., should be sown tolerably deep, to guard against 
injury from a long dry time, else they must be watered in 



58 THE lady's annual register. 

dry weather. But seeds that vegetate in a short time, as the 
turnip, cabbage, mustard, &c., will generally vegetate with a 
light covering. 

Trees, Shrubs, and Flowers. It is said if you fill flower- 
pots about half full of quick-Hme, and cover over this a good 
mould, the flowers may thus be obtained in a very short 
time, and during the whole season. The earth should be 
kept slightly moistened, and pressed down whenever it rises 
by the swelling of the lime. 



Kitchen Garden. Continue to plant beans and peas every 
fortnight. Transplant cabbage -plants, if not done in Febru- 
ary. Water early in the morning. Plant map beans end of 
the month. Onions and leeks neglected, should now be 
sown. Hoe young plants. Do not delay turnips any longer. 
The sooner your Irish potatoes are down the better. Car- 
rots and parsnips may still be sown. Thin radishes, and 
sow two crops this month. Transplant lettuces. Sow small 
salads once a fortnight. If a morning frost lies on your sal- 
ad, pour cold water on before the sun comes on it. If pars- 
ley has not been sown, attend to it now. Sow tomato seed 
about the middle of the month ; also peppers of all sorts ; 
also water and musk-melons for first crop. Choose a shel- 
tered place, and plant cucumbers. Orach in low rich land. 
Squashes and pumpkins about the middle of the month may 
thrive. Thin beets, but not transplant. Sow celery middle 
of the month, and spinage. Hoe spinage of last month, and 
thin it. Dress asparagus-beds, if not done. Artichokes may 
succeed if you plant soon this month. 

Fruits, Shrubs, and Flowers. About the beginning of 



THE LADY S ANNUAL REGISTER. 59 

this month, you may with safety transplant orange, lemon, 
and lime trees, and prune them if not done before. This is 
a good time for removing fig trees. The first week of this 
month is the latest for trimming peach, nectarine, and apricot 
trees ; also other fruit trees. You have slill a chance to 
plant fruit trees. Look well to the strawberry beds. Sow 
china pink, and amaranthus. Geraniums as in January. 



THE CELLAR AND THE STORE-ROOM. 

Come, Miss Elvina, lay aside that novel, and walk do^vn 
cellar with me. You must aid ^^our mother, who has cares 
enough in her household. Nay, never look with dismay at 
your wrought slippers and white morning gown. They are 
easily changed. If your cellar is damp and dirty, all that 
bright bloom may vanish from your cheeks in the autumn. 
A dirty cellar to a fine house, is like an uncleanly person un- 
der gay clothes. In a northern cellar, great dampness gath- 
ers through the winter from vegetables, cider barrels, apples, 
milk, &c. &c. ; and there should be a thorough inspection 
twice a year, beside the daily cleaning. People are very apt 
to think a cellar too much out of the Vv^ay to require neat and 
careful observance. The store-room generally gains more 
attention, as it is usually light and cheerful. Once a year 
change the position of your barrels, &c. It is said that wild 
myrtle will keep the weaviis out of rice, if stuck about the 
hoops, &c. N. B. It drives away fleas, if worn about the 
person. Lard, at the south, cannot well be kept in anything 
but stone or china vessels, in warm weather. It is said that 
a large stone put in the middle of a barrel of meal, or grist, 
will help to keep it cool. They must be occasionally stirred.

Eggs will keep in lime-water, one pint of coarse salt, and 
one pint of unslacked lime, to a pailful of water. If there 
be too much lime, it will eat the shells from the eggs ; if 
there is a single cracked egg, it will spoil the Avhole. Mrs. 
Child says she has seen eggs thus kept perfectly sweet and 
fresh at the end of three years. 

Look to your pickles often — and if soft, drain off the old 
vinegar, and put in more, fresh and scalding hot. Season 
as at first. Mrs. Child recommends a piece of alum to be 
added. Salt-fish must be changed from a cellar to a garret 
alternately in the northern States. At the south, a store- 
room is usually the right temperature. 

See to the butter, which will soon be in danger from the 
approach of warm weather ; and do not buy now in quanti- 
ties, especially at the south. Keep a hea^y stone on your 
salt-pork, to keep it under the brine. Keep a broom in the 
cellar, and one in your store-room. It is a bad plan to be 
running about for a broom or brush ; and it is better economy 
to have one for each story and each locked-up room, as they 
are not injured by keeping, n. b. If there is a broom, do 
not be afraid to use it. 



cooking recipes. 

Icing. One pound of sugar, half a pint of water ; boil them un- 
til they are quite clear 5 then beat them until they are blood-warm ; 
beat the whites of five eggs very light, and add them to the luke- 
warm syrup, and then pour it over the cake. Stir the eggs into the 
sjTup, and not pour the syrup over the eggs. This icing is not af- 
fected by damp weather. 

Salt-rising, for Bread. A stiff batter of flower and milk-warm 
water, and a little salt, to be set into milk-warm water until it rises 
to the top of the vessel — (a pint of batter to be put into a quart ves-

sel,) the flour to be made up with the rising about as stifi" as common 
dough ; put into the oven, and allowed to rise again. The bread 
made in this manner will be perfectly sweet, and free from acidity. 

Chowder. Four or five slices pickled pork fried dry and a little 
brown, put at the bottom of the pot, with alternate layers of sliced 
potatoes, cracker, and fish — season with salt, pepper, and small on- 
ions, and as much water as will nearly cover the whole, to be stewed 
steadily for about fifteen minutes. The fish must be laid in salt and 
water a short time previously, in order to make it firm. 

Loaf Cake. Half a pound flour, quarter of a pound of butter, one 
pound of sugar, half a pound of currants, half a pint of molasses, 
ten eggs, a small lump of pearlash dissolved in a table-spoonful of 
cream — clove, cinnamon to your taste ; one glass of wine. 

A rich Loaf Cake. Six pounds of flower, four of butter, four of 
sugar, three dozen of eggs, six pounds of currants, half a pint of 
brandy, a pint of wine, one ounce of nutmegs, one ounce of cinna- 
mon, one ounce of mace, one ounce of cloves, citron to your taste. 

Yellow Pickle, or Axe-jar. One pound race ginger, one garlic, one 
horseradish, half a pound white mustard-seed, half a pound white 
pepper, three ounces turmeric, two oimces cloves, one ounce mace. 
Bruise the ginger, garlic and turmeric, and half of the pepper a little ; 
put them into a stone jar, with two gallons of white vinegar. Shake 
it about very often for two weeks, keeping it constantly in the sun. 
Take cabbage, cauliflower, asparagus, &c., keep them in salt and 
water two days, scald them in fresh water, and put them to dry in 
the sun for a few hours ; then throw them into the pickle. Cucum- 
bers, beans, young corn, or any vegetable you fancy, may be done in 
the same way. 



ANE C DOTE S . 

A la\^-yer, in Ireland, who was pleading the cause of an infant 
plaintifi", took the child up in his arms, and presented it to the jury, 
suffused with tears. This had a great effect till the opposite lawyer 
asked, what made him cry ? ' He pinched me ! ' answered the little 
innocent. The whole court was convulsed with laughter. 

At a late court, a man and his wife brought cross actions, each 
charging the other with having committed assault and battery. On

investigation, it appeared that the husband had pushed the door 
against the wife, and the wife in turn pushed the door against the 
husband. A gentleman of the bar remarked that he could see no 
irapropriet}^ in a man and his wife a-^ore-ing each other. 

A pedantic fellow called for a bottle of hock at a tavern, which 
the waiter, not hearing distinctly, asked him to repeat. ' A bottle of 
hock — hie, haec, hoc,' replied the visiter. After sitting, however, a 
long time, and no wine appearing, he ventured to ring again, and in- 
quire into the cause of the delay. ' Did I not order some hock, sir ? 
why is it not brought in ? ' ' Because,' answered the waiter, (who 
had been taught Latin grammar) ' j^ou afterwards declined it.' 

A man was observed, on a cold evening, sitting on a small bridge, 
with his naked feet immersed in the running stream. Being asked 
the reason of so singular a measure, he replied that he was to sing 
bass, in concert, the following day, and was endeavoring to take cold 
to prepare his voice. 

A person asking another, while ■viewing the front of Covent-garden 
theatre, of what order the pillars at the entrance were, received the 
answer, ' Why, sir, I am not very conversant in the orders of archi- 
tecture ; but from their being at the entrance of the house, I take it 
for granted, it must be the Dor-ic' 

A Yankee, speaking of his children, said he had seven sons, none 
of whom looked alike but Jonathan, and Jonathan did look just alike. 



HYMNS FOR CHILDREN. 
MORNING HYMN. 

This is the morning hour. 

And beautiful to see ; 
The sun beams out with glorious power 

And kindling majesty. 



Oh, what have I to do 

With slothful visions now ? 

Let me my early prayers renew. 
With bright and happy brow. 



THE LADY S ANNUAL REGISTER. 

For God has blessed my night, 
And nerved my youthful frame, 

And I will seek him with delight, 
Through Jesus's blessed name. 

EVENING HYMN. 

'T is evening, and the skies 
With starry lights are spread ; 

How very fair the moonbeams rise, 
And silver radiance shed ! 

I will retire to rest 

'Neath Nature's lovely eye, 
And feel my nightly slumber blest. 

For God is watching by. 

And if the wing of death 

Should sweep o'er my repose, 

Resigned I '11 yield to Him my breath, 
And rise as Jesus rose. 

infant's HYMN- 

When all the pretty flowers I see, 

So brightly blooming, fresh and new ; 

I wonder where the hand can be 

Which plants them out, and sheds the dew 

"When through the air each little bird 
So lightly waves its downy wing ; 

I long to know who spoke the word 
That bade them live, and fly, and sing. 

When all the stars are spangled out, 
Like diamonds in the evening sky. 

My infant mind is all in doubt 

Who hung these glorious things so high.

But when I think upon myself, 

My hands and fingers, mouth and eyes, 

With heart to feel, and tongue to speak ! 
Oh — then, new doubts and wonders rise. 

How great, how glorious is our God ! 

Who made the treasures he unfolds ! 
Who plants with trees and flowers the sod, 

And blesses all that he beholds. 

To thee, my heavenly Father, still 
To thee my grateful song shall rise ; 

My highest joy to do thy will, 

Till thou, in death, shall close my eyes. 



A WORLD OF BOYS. 

If all were youth, and this a world of boys, 

Think, what a scene of trifles, tricks, and toys ! 

How would each minute of the livelong day, 

In wild, obstreperous frohc waste away ! 

A world of boys ! defend us from a brood 

So wanton, rash, improvident, and rude ; 

Truants from duty, and in arts unskill'd. 

Their minds and manners, like their fields, untiil'd ; 

Their furniture, of gaudy trinkets made ; 

Sweetmeats the staple article of trade : 

No fruit allowed to ripen on the tree. 

And not a bird's nest from invasion free. 

In public life, there still would meet your sight, 

The same neglect of duty and of right. 

Pray, for a sample, take a stripling court, 

And see which there would triumph, law or sport. 

' Adjourn, Adjourn,' some beardless judge would say 

' I '11 hear the trial — when I 've done my play ;' 

Or, if the judge sat faithful to the laws, 

Hear how the counsel might defend his cause.

' May 't please your honor, 't is your turn to stop, 

I '11 spin my speech, when I have spun my top.' 

Mean^\-hile, the jury pluck each others' hair, 

The bar toss notes and dockets into air, 

The sheriff, order 'd to keep silence, cries, 

' Oh, yes ! oh, yes ! when I have caught these flies.' 

Such were the revellings of this giddy sphere, 

If youth alone enjoyed dominion here ; 

Their glory, mischief, and their business, play, 

And life itself a misspent holiday. 



THE POOR woman's APPEAL TO HER HUSBAND. 

You took me, Colin, when a girl, unto your home and heart. 

To bear in all your after fate a fond and faithful part ; 

And tell me, have I ever tried that duty to forego — 

Or pined there was not joy for me, when you were sunk in wo ? 

No — I would rather share yonr grief than any other's glee. 

For though you're nothing to the world, you're all the world to me ; 

You make a palace of my shed — this rough-hewn bench a throne, 

There 's sunlight for me in your smile, and music in your tone. 

I look upon you when you sleep, my eyes with tears grow^ dim, 

I cry ' O Parent of the poor, look down from Heaven on him : 

Behold him toil from day to day, exhausting strength and soul — 

Look down with mercy on him, Lord, for thou canst make him 

w^hole ! ' 
And when at last relieving sleep has on my eyelids smiled, 
How oft are they forbid to close in slumber, by my child ; 
I take the little murmurer, that spoOs my span of rest, 
And feel it is a part of thee I lull upon my breast. 
There 's only one return I crave, — I may not need it long, 
And it may soothe thee when I 'm where the wretched feel no wrong ! 
I ask not for a kinder tone — for thou wert ever kind ; 
I ask not for less frugal fare — my fare I do not mind ; 
I ask not for more gay attire — if such as I have got 
Suffice to make me fair to thee, for more I murmur not ; 
But I would ask some share of hours that you at clubs bestow — 



GQ THE lady's annual REGISTER. 

Of knowledge that you prize so much, may I not something know ? 

Subtract from meetings among men, each eve, an hour for me — 

Make me companion of your soul, as I may surely be ! 

If you will read, I '11 sit and work ; then think when you 're away — 

Less tedious I shall find the time, dear Colin, of your stay. 

A meet companion soon I '11 be for e'en your studious hours, — 

And teacher of those little ones you call your cottage flowers ; 

And if we be not rich and great, we may be wise and kind ; 

And as my heart can warm your heart, so may my mind your mind. 



THE HOUSEHOLD WOMAN. 

By Caroline Gilnian. 

Graceful may seem the fairy form. 
With youth and health and beauty warm. 
Gliding along the airy dance. 
Imparting joy at every glance. 

And lovely too, when o'er the strings 
Her hand of music woman flings, 
While dewy eyes are upward thrown, 
As if from Heaven to claim the tone. 

And fair is she when mental flowers 
Engage her soul's devoted powers. 
And wreaths — unfading wreaths of mind, 
Around her temples are entwined. 

But never in her varied sphere 
Is woman to the heart more dear, 
Than when her homely task she plies. 
With cheerful duty in her eyes ; 
And every low^y path well trod. 
Looks meekly upward to her God.

Kitchen Garden. The artichoke can be cuhivated in some 
northern soils; it is a favorite vegetable in the southern 
States. The most common mode of cooking it, is boilino*. 
It is raised from seeds sown three-fourths of an inch deep, in 
this month or in May ; or from offset suckers, separated in 
April, and planted in rows four feet apart, and in hills two 
feet asunder. It requires a deep rich soil. (The vegetable 
called Jerusalem artichoke, and used for pickles, is not prop- 
erly an artichoke.) Clear your ground of aU insects and 
reptiles, except earth-worms, which are useful to soil. Pre- 
pare asparagus beds. Sow early beans and peas. Plant 
potatoes for early use. Sow beets, cabbages, carrots, cresses, 
and celery, towards the last of the month. See if youi cab- 
bage plants are large enough to set out. Sow fennel, mar- 
joram, savory, sage, parsley, lettuce, onions, parsnips, rad- 
ishes, and salsafy. Sow cucumbers in pots, under glass. 
Sow cauliflowers, caidoons, and coleworts. Sow round-

leaved spinage. Plant potatoes : this is the latest time for 
success with most kinds. 

Trees, Skjnibs, and Flowers. It is recommended, by the 
Genessee Farmer, to scrape off the scaly particles of the dead 
bark of fruit and forest trees in the spring, while the sap is 
forcing up, and wash wnth soapsuds and other alkalis. Put 
cinders, bones, or stones, about the roots of pear trees. 
Plant shrubs and roses. Begin to sow flower seeds towards 
the last of the month, and vines for shade. The vine com- 
monly known as the mock-orange, with its large grape-like 
leaves, the convolvulus, scarlet bean, &c., will refresh you 
and beautify porches, windows, &c. Bury dahlias in light 
earth, and keep in a warm room. The hydrangea — a 
showy and ornamental plant — is seldom successfully culti- 
vated in this section, although there is nothing in its culture 
that should exclude them from the cultivation of any indi- 
vidual. Many of these plants are killed by persons w^ho 
wish to enrich the soil ; manure is added, and manure to the 
hydrangea is sure death. The plant may be propagated by 
layers and by cuttings. In the latter case, the shoots should 
be taken off in the spring, about a fortnight previous to the 
breaking of the buds, just as they begin to swell, or in the 
fall, tw^o or three weeks after they have finished their sum- 
mer's gTowth, and the wood begins to harden. Cut the 
shoots off below a bud, with from one to three inches of the 
wood, and insert in a small pot, to be shaded from the rays 
of the hot sun. As they increase in size, they should be 
shifted to larger pots. The soil most suited to the hydran- 
gea, and in which it delights, is peat or bog earth, in the 
place of which, if these cannot be obtained, you may use 
leaf mould. Give a good drainage to the pots, and when 
the plants come in bloom, keep them well saturated with 
water, and allow them only a few hours sun, in the morning.

Kitchen Garden. You may venture to plant beans, for a 
last crop in the country ; also peas. Your spring-sown cab- 
bages will now be fit for transplanting. Plant early York 
and sugar-loaf, next battersea and drumhead, and last, late 
cabbages and savoy, for autumn crop. Sow cauliflowers 
and broccoli. Soav full crops snap and bush beans. Clear 
carrots and parsnips of weeds, and thin them. Sow for win- 
ter crop. Pull out seed-heads from autumn onions as soon 
as they appear. Sow leeks for winter use. Hoe and thin 
turnips. Begin culling asparagus-shoots for eating w^hen 
they are about three or four inches in height. Hoe potatoes, 
and draw earth round them. Sow more radishes. Trans- 
plant lettuces of last month ; and sow twice in April. Con- 
tinue to sow small salads, if wanted. Sow celery for gen- 
eral crop. Mint may be planted ; shoots from the old roots. 
Sow cucumbers and melons, for full crop ; also squashes and 
pumpkins. The sooner you get okra into the gTound, (if it 
has been neglected) the better. Thin February beets, if not 
done. Do not let weeds get ahead of you; they grow 
quicker than your plants. 

Fruits^ Sh7'ubs, and Flowers. If two shoots put out from 
one eye on your vines, take away the weakest with the 
finger and thumb. Take the runners from strawberries, un- 
less you want plants for another bed next year. Water 
newly planted trees well once a week. Put out china-asters. 
Sow carnations in a cool situation ; water them sparingly ; 
shade them during summer, and do not remove until No- 
vember. Sow sweet-williams in a cool situation. Gerani- 
ums as in January. Set out hydrangeas in open air in 
shady places.

UP STAIRS . 



Housewives must be as busy up stairs as doA\'Ti. Cham- 
ber-maids are liable to neglect their business. Why should 
they care if bugs are in your bedsteads, and your windows 
require cleaning ? Will they examine closets and garrets ? 
You must not expect it of them. If they make beds, and 
sweep, and fill the pitchers with water, they are satisfied. 
A walk up a few pair of stairs, will be useful every way to 
you or your elder girls. 

If you are a mother, visit your children's rooms (grown-up 
ones, also) almost daity. Sit a little while with your sons 
and daughters, not as a spy, but to gain their confidence 
and to find out their wants. A word of advice will come to 
them with more power, as they sit apart from the family, 
than in the social circle. 

Change the places of your bed-room furniture spring and 
fall. It gives a pleasant variety to a house ; and removing 
from one side of a room to another, promotes cleanliness. 
Many a cobweb and bunch of lint will be developed in these 
movements. 

It is almost impossible (quite, in warm climates) to keep 
bedsteads entirely free from bugs, unless they are taken 
down and cleansed once a year. Beat up two whites of 
eggs with an ounce of quicksilver, and rub in every crevice. 
If your feather-beds smell badly or become heavy, empty 
them, and wash the feathers in soap-suds ; spread them in a 
garret or dry out-house, and they will freshen up as if new. 

At the south, millers begin to appear in April. Begin to 
look out for your woolens. The northerners may be quiet 
on that subject until May. Provide abundantly basins, tubs, 
&c., for the use of your families in their bed-rooms ; and a 
bathinof-room for all.

RECIPES FOR COOKING, &C. 

To keep Milk sweet. The following facts may be of service to those 
who are in the habit of purchasing milk in quantities, and do not wish 
it to become sour. Dr. Hare, of Philadelphia, in giving an account 
in SilUman's Journal, of his experiments upon the essential oils, 
seems to think that the acrid ones will resist putrefaction better than 
the mild ones. Among other experiments, he states that he found 
' the essential oil of cloves and cinnamon possessed of an antiseptic 
power quite equal to that of kreosote.' 

' On the second of July, he added two drops of oil of cinnamon to an 
ounce measure of fresh milk ; it remained liquid on the eleventh, and 
though it finally coagulated, it continued free from bad taste or smell, 
till September, although other portions of the same milk had become 
putrid.' Now it may be possible, two drops to the ounce of milk, 
may render it a little too spicy for common purposes ; but this fact 
may lead to the discover}^ of some substance that may be added, and 
while it does not injure the taste or qualities of the milk, preserves it 
a long time from becoming sour, or from putrefying. A small quan- 
tity of pearlash or soda thrown into a basin of milk, will prevent it 
from becoming sour, and even restore it after it has become slightly 
soured. One tea-spoonful is generally sufficient for a pan containing 
one gallon of milk. Soda is preferable to either pearlash or cinna- 
mon oil. 

Dairy Secret. Have read)' two pans in boiling water ; and on the 
new milk's coming to the dairy, take the hot pans out of the water, 
put the milk into one of them, and cover it with the other. This 
will occasion great augmentation in the thickness and quality of the 
cream. 

Mock Turtle of Calfs Head. Have the head nicely cleaned, divide 
the chop from the skull, take out the brains and tongue, and boil the 
other parts till tender ; take them out of the water and put into it a 
knuckle of veal or four pounds of lean beef, three onions chopped, 
thyme, parsley, a teaspoonful of pounded cloves, the same of mace ; 
salt and cayenne pepper to taste ; boil these things together till re- 
duced to a pint, strain it and add two gills of red wine, one of mush- 
room and one of walnut catsup ; thicken it with butter and brown

flower ; the head must be cut in small pieces and stewed a few min- 
utes in the gravy ; put a paste round the edge of a deep dish, three 
folds one on the other, but none on the bottom ; pour in the meat and 
gravy, and bake it till the paste is done ; pick all the strings from the 
brains, pound them and add grated bread, pepper, and salt, make 
them in little cakes with the yolk of an egg ; fry them a nice brown ; 
boil six eggs hard ; leave one whole, and divide the others exactly in 
two ; have some bits of paste nicely baked. "When the head is taken 
from the oven, lay the whole egg in the middle, and dispose the oth- 
ers, with the brain-cakes and bits of paste tastily around it. If it be 
wanted as soup, do not reduce the gravy so much ; and after stewing 
the head, serve it in a tureen, with the brain-cakes and forcemeat- 
balls fried, in place of the eggs and paste. The tongue should be 
salted and put in brine : they are very delicate ; and four of them 
boiled and pealed, and served with four small chickens boiled, make 
a handsome dish, either cold or hot, with parsley and butter poured 
over them. 

Extract from an old Almanac. The men who are farmers by book, 
are no farmers for me. They make much talk and parade about 
their compost and their non-compost, and all that ; but give me the 
man who prefers his hands to books, and with a little mil fetch a 
great deal to pass. Let those w^ho follow husbandry for amusement, 
try experiments. Poh, nonsense ! Why, my wife, the other day — 
silly woman — undertook to bake a pudding by the book. And she 
book'd it and book'd it, and after all never cook'd it. Zounds ! said 
I — Sarah, this never will do for working farmers ; if we undertake 
to make puddings and som^ turnips by the book, we shall get to the 
last page of our business before Ave are half ready. Let learned 
men attend to cases, genders, moods, and tenses ; you and I will see 
to our dairies, flocks, and fields and fences. Come, where are the 
boys ? Here is business enough for an army of us ! Now is the 
time, you know, to clear out the ditches, and to carry the mud into 
the barnyard. We must also be about ploughing ; and there is the 
garden matters. Now let us see that the cucumbers are picked. 
Gather the seeds as they ripen.

ANECDOTES , 

A humorous divine, visiting a gentleman whose wife was none of 
the most amiable, overheard his friend say, ' If it were not for the 
stranger in the next room, I would kick you out of doors. Upon 
which the clerg}^man stepped in and said, ' Pray sir, make no stran- 
ger of me.' 

An honest clerg)'man in the country was reproving a married 
couple for their frequent dissensions, seeing they were both one. 
^ Both one ! ' cried the husband ; ' were you to come by our door some- 
times when we quarrel, you would swear we were twenty.' 

A person was boasting that he was sprung from a high family m 
Ireland. Yes, said a bystander, I have seen some of the same fam- 
ily so high that their feet could not touch the ground. 

An Irish sailor, as he was riding, made a pause ; the horse, m 
beating off the flies, caught his hind foot in the stirrup. The sailor 
observing it, exclaimed, ' How now, Dobbin, if you are going to get 
on, I will get off ; for, by the powers, I will not ride double with you . 

A Hibernian, seeing an old man and woman in the stocks, said 
that they put him in mind of ' the babes in the wood.' 

An Irishman, some years ago, attending the University of Edin- 
burgh, waited upon one of the most celebrated teachers of the Ger- 
man flute, desiring to know on what terms he would give him a few 
lessons. The flute-player informed him that he generally charged 
two guineas for the first month, and one guinea for the second. 
-' Then, by my sowl,' replied the cunning Hibernian, ' I '11 come the 
second month.' 



THE DELAY OF SPRING. 

Oh, balmy Spring, why ling'rest thou 
In distant climes, where Winter's brow 
Long since has fled, and not a bough 
Implores thy verdant livery now 
The sighing groves to cheer ?

Do sweeter warblers hail thee there ? 
Do richer flowers perfume thine air ? 
IMore garlands do thine altars bear, 
Or are they decked by hands more fair 
Than those which greet thee here ? 

But thou would' St find, O season bland ! 
Even here a thousand votaries stand 
Around thy shrine with willing hand, 
And anxious wait thy soft command, 

To pour their oflT'rings pure ; 
And oft some lonely warbler's power 
Tries to revive the leafless bower ; 
And here and there some peeping flower, 
Impatient for thy genial hour, 

Sheds odors premature. 

Oh, hasten then, and reillume 
Thy mourning votaries' anxious gloom ; 
Let bower and grove and vale assume 
The riches of their native bloom, 

The riches thou canst give : 
Come then, and let thy breezes bring 
Their sweetly varied murmuring ; 
And raise the raptured warbler's wing, 
And make unnumbered flowerets spring, 

And bid all nature live ! 

For joy and health are thine ! and oh, 
The elastic nerve — the vivid glow — 
Th' elated spirits' rapturous flow — 
And every balm for every wo, 
With thy soft breath are given : 
Nor these alone ; blest Spring, 't is thine 
To yield the mind's sweet anodyne ; 
Th' ethereal sense — the feeling fine — 
The firm resolve — the high design — 
And thought that lifts to Heaven !

for the New-Englander, in May. Sow tomatoes in a warm 
situation. Let potatoes lie in the sun, or in a warm room, 
before they are planted. Plant cucumbers, melons, squash- 
es, and gourds. Plant bean crop ; weed and thin radishes ; 
plant corn for table use ; sow carrots ; weed April plants ; 
sow turneps and peas ; transplant early lettuce. Throw lime 
into the hole with potatoes, when planting. 

Trees, Shrubs, and Flowers. Now is the last opportunity 
for scions of fruit trees for grafting. Spade carefully round 
the roots of gooseberries ; prune branches, and prevent their 
crossing. The best form for a well-trained gooseberry or 
currant bush, is that of a wine-glass. When your parlor 
bulbs begin to look decayed, give them no more water, but

turn the jars on their sides until the earth is dry; then take 
out the bulbs and put them in a dry place, for replanting in 
the fall. Set out dahlias in warm spots. Sow annual 
flower seeds this month in pots for transplanting, or in bor- 
ders in the garden.

Kitchen Garden. Snap-beans may be planted. Sow 
cabbage seed, if heretofore neglected ; also cauliflowers, car- 
rots, and parsneps. Sow lettuce. There is no use in trans- 
planting now. Mustard, cress, &c., may be sowed. Salmon 
turnep radishes will succeed any time this month ; also spin- 
age. Sow celery for a late crop. Sow a succession of crops 
of cucumbers, melons, squashes, &c. Be careful to water, 
if dry. Transplant peppers and tomatoes planted last month. 
Plant winter beets, if not done. Gather mint, balm, sage, 
&;c., if nearly at full growth. Gather such medicinal herbs 
as are in flower. Do not dry herbs in the sun. 

Fruits, Shrubs, and Floioers. Thin fruit from your trees, 
if crowded. Give summer pruning to peach, nectarine, and 
apricot trees. Look to unnecessary shoots on your vines. 
Take away suckers from the bottom of fig trees, and cut off' 
shoots carefully from the old wood. Keep hydrangeas in 
cool, moist, but not rich earth. It is propagated by layers 
and cuttings. 

Garden and House Flowers. If you have room for a gar- 
den, it can be a source of gi'eat delight to your family. It 
will be a refreshing spot for the gentlemen of your house- 
hold when wearied with the bustle of a business life. Your 
children will love to gather flowers there ; and the exercise 
will be healthful. Give each of them a small patch of

ground, and let them show their taste in arranging it. You 
will yourself find it a pleasant luxury, particularly if cir- 
cumstances lead you to sedentary habits. Have a conven- 
ient shelter for your tools, and see that the young gardeners 
are careful in returning them to their places. If you have 
not a gardening spot, train up a few vines about jouv prem- 
ises, Vv'ith a flower-pot here and there, to give a pretty effect 
to your hom_e. I recollect one day, in a crowded street in a 
city, entering a confined shop, and not feeling very vrell, I 
requested a seat. One was offered me in an inner apart- 
ment ; and I could not but look with surprise and delight on 
the prospect that lay by the little parlor door. There was a 
small enclosure, not more than five feet wide, nor fifteen 
long, cultivated with perfect taste. Flowers, of the sweetest 
hue and perfume, were trained with the most admirable re- 
gard to space ; and in the confined yard adjoining, a rich 
peach tree was bending with fruit. The woman who tended 
the shop stepped out to speak with me ; and I discovered 
from her remarks, that she cultivated her garden at night 
when the shop was closed, and enjoyed it by moonlight. 



USEFUL NOTICES. 

Washing Silks. ' Lay the piece of silk upon a clean board ; soap 
a piece of flannel wet, and with this rub the silk carefully and evenly 
one way; after having thus cleansed one side of the silk, take a wet 
sponge and wash off the soap ; proceed in the same manner to clean 
the other side, and then wipe the water off of each with a clean dry 
cloth; after which hang the silk in the air to dry; do not \\Ting it, 
but hang it as single as possible upon a linen horse, and let it dry 
gradually. When very nearly dry, iron it with a cool box. In this 
manner we last summer washed a slate-colored dress, which was so 
dirty, with the constant wear of a winter, that we did not like to use

it, even for linings, without endeavoring to remove some of the spots, 
and we were quite hopeless of its being fit for anything except lin- 
ings, even when washed ; but its brightness was completely restored, 
and its texture softer than when new.' 

Cheap and easy method to preserve Felts covered with Fur, from injury 
by vermin, during summer months. Sprinkle tobacco on them, roll and 
compress them together, and secure them with a small ligature. 
Then enclose them in a linen or cotton bag, and place them in a 
dark closet. Buffalo robes, muffs, caps, boas, &:c., treated in this 
way, will not fade nor be at all injured by moths or other vermin 
during the warm season. 

Recipe for coloring Flannel. Take black alder bark, boil it well, 
then skim or strain the liquor. Wet the cloth in a pretty strong lye, 
and dip it into the alder liquor ; let it remain till cool enough to 
Amng, and you have an indelible orange color. The better the cloth, 
the better the color. 

A method of preve?iting Iron and Steel from rusting after being nervly 
ground. A blacksmith, who was formerly engaged in the manufac- 
ture of sickles, says that the method he adopted to prevent his sickles 
from rusting after grinding, M^as to immerse them for an hour in 
water strongly impregnated with lime. This had the desired effect. 

To make Flate look new. Take unslacked lime and alum, a pound 
each ; of aquavitse and vinegar, each a pint ; and of beer-grounds, 
two quarts ; boil the plate in these, and they will set a beautiful gloss 
upon it. 

Preserved Flowers and Plants. You may dry plants and herbs, 
and retain the whole of the volatile oil, aroma, and color of 
the plant. Place the specimens in a close dark room; when the 
plants are nearly dcrj, press them in small quantities, enveloped in 
paper, until the oil appears on the surface, which you will know by 
its discoloring the paper ; then do them up in clean paper bags, and 
they will retain their fragrance and medicinal properties for years. 

Remedies against Rats and Mice. Take a spoonful of flour, mixed 
with some scrapings of old cheese and seeds of hemlock, (cicuta) 
made as fine as possible. Set it where the mice haunt. If it be set 
in a house, let it not be in the same opartment M'ith anything which 
is used as food by the family. This mixture, according to Deane's 
New-England Farmer, will destroy all the mice which have access 
to it J and the same poison will destroy rats.

Poison by ivy is said to be of an acid nature, and alkalies are re- 
commended as remedies for it. Lime-water, lye obtained from wood 
ashes, or weak solutions of pot or pearlash, will therefore be good 
applications in cases of poison by ivy. Soft soap and cold water are 
likewise useful in such cases. 

HINTS FROM MRS. CHILD. 

Brass andirons should be cleaned, done up in papers, and put in a 
dry place during the summer season. 

If you have a large family, it is well to keep white rags separate 
from colored ones, and cotton separate from woolen ; they bring a 
higher price. Paper brings a cent a pound, and if you have plenty 
of room, it is well to save it. 'A penny saved is a penny earned.' 

Always have plenty of dish-water, and have it hot. There is no 
need of asking the character of a domestic, if you have ever seen 
her wash dishes in a little greasy water. 

"When molasses is used in cooking, it is a prodigious improvement 
to boil and skim it before you use it. It takes out the unpleasant 
raw taste, and makes it almost as nice as sugar. Where molasses is 
used much for cooking, it is well to prepare one or two gallons in this 
way at a time. 

In winter, always set the handle of your pump as high as possible 
before you go to bed. This keeps the handle from freezing. When 
there is reason to apprehend extreme cold, do not forget to throw a 
rug or horse-blanket over your pump ; a frozen pump is a comfortless 
preparation for a winter's breakfast. 

Never allow ashes to be taken up in wood, or put into wood. Al- 
ways have your tinder-box and lantern ready for use, in case of sud- 
den alarm. Have important papers all together, where you can lay 
your hand on them at once, in case of fire. 

IMPROVEJVIENTS WANTED. 

Cleaning Knives and Forks. We seem to be in the dark ages still, 
about cleaning knives and forks ; the present process is tedious and 
dangerous. It is a little remarkable that no machine has been con- 
structed to save labor and fretting in this business.

into a barn-yard, where there stood a young lad. The drover calls 
to the boy, ' Stop that cow, my lad, stop that cow.' ' I am no con-

' Well, speak to her then.' The boy took off" his hat, and very hand-

An Irish student was once asked what was meant by posthumous

had two thousand pounds with her.' ' That is well again.' ' Not so 
well, neither, for I laid it out in sheep, and they all died of the rot.' 
'That was hard, in truth.' ' Not so hard, neither, for I sold the skins 
for more than the sheep cost me.' ' Aye, that made you amends.' 
' Not so much amends, neither, for I laid out my money in a house, 
and it was burned.' ' That was a great loss, indeed.' ' Not so great 
a loss, for my wife was burned in it.' 



A JUDICIOUS WOIMAN. 

Not long since a lady wished to purchase a shawl, but found it dif- 
ficult to get one which exactly suited her taste. At length she found 
one which seemed to unite all the requisites. Alas ! on inquiry, the 
price was higher than her prudence told her she ought to give. Still 
the article was so exactly suited to her wishes, that she hesitated and 
looked at it. The shopman availed himself of her indecision to ex- 
tol the beauty and advantage of this shawl over every other shawl 
in the store, or even in the city. He named two ladies of fashion 
who had purchased the others ; and these (a crowning argument) 
were the only ones beside which had been imported. It was a new 
pattern, a new fabric, and there would be no more shawls like it un- 
til spring, and she had better not lose the present opportunity. She 
wavered — she asked a friend's advice — her friend urged her to 
take it, and said she knew her husband would not refuse to indulge 
her taste. 

After a little deliberation, she said, ' I know my husband would 
like to gratify me, but it may be inconvenient to him to pay so much 
at this time, and I will consult with him about it.' She concluded 
her remarks with this judicious observation : that she ' had rather 
her husband should make an objection before she should purchase an 
expensive article, than complain of an extravagance after she had 
obtained it.' 

Would all women reason in this way, half the evils of married 
life would be avoided. How many kind-hearted but inconsiderate 
wives would be spared from the reproach of extravagance and bad 
management, if they would first consult their husbands' convenience.

SONG. 

By Mrs. Wells. 

New-England, New-England, mj'- home o'er the sea! 
My heart, as I wander, turns fondly to thee ; 
For bright rests the sun on thy clear winding streams, 
And soft o'er thy meadows the moon pours her beams. 

New-England, New -England, my home o'er the sea! 

The wanderer's heart turns in fondness to thee. 

Thy breezes are healthful, and clear are thy rills, 
And the harvest waves proudly and rich on thy hills. 
Thy maidens are fair, and thy yeomen are strong. 
And thy rivers run blithely thy valleys among. 

New-England, NcAv-England, my home o'er the sea! 

The wanderer's heart turns in fondness to thee. 

There's a home in New-England, where dear ones of mine 
Are thinking of me and the days of lang syne ; 
And blest be the hour when, my pilgrimage o'er, 
I shall sit by that hearth-stone and leave it no more. 

New-England, New-England, my home o'er the sea ! 

My heart, as I wander, turns fondly to thee. 



TO A FRIEND. 

By Caroline Gilman. 

The moon that proudly treads the sky, 
Were doubly bright if thou wert nigh ; 
The breeze that murmurs on mine ear, 
Were softer still, if thou wert here ; 
The sky would beam a lovelier blue, 
If thou couldst whisper, ' I am true ; ' 
And thoughts of Heaven bear firmer sway 
If thou shouldst point, and lead the Avay.

Xortfjcrn e^avticix Calciitiav. 

Kitchen Garden. Late crops may be raised of oats, ruta 
baga, beans, peas, potatoes, and mangel Vviirtzel or field 
beet. Sow turneps among corn. About the last of the 
month, sow crops of melons and cucumbers, for pickling. 
Thin m^elon plants. Look for the cut-worm at the roots of 
plants. Transplant tomatoes. It is ver^' necessary" to soak 
such seeds as are slow in vegetating, such as beet, onion, 
carrot, parsnep, martjmia, watermelon, asparagus, parsley, 
celery, and many others ; and it will not injure them to soak 
them thirty or forty hours. It is not so necessary to soak 
some other seeds ; or if they are soaked, a less time will 
suffice — such as turnep, cabbage, cucumber, squash, pump- 
kin, and some others. 

Fruits, Shrubs, and Flowers. Early in June is about the 
safest time to set out dahlia plants : put a neat stake down 
by the plants, as they are brittle. Transplant annuals, such 
as blue amethyst, scarlet tassel flower, double balsams, asters.

Kitchen Garden. Continue to plant snap beans. April 
cabbage plants may be transplanted. Cauliflowers may still 
succeed. Transplant April growth. Sow carrots and pars- 
neps in showery weather, for winter use. Hoe and thin. 
Still sow cabbage. Hoe and thin lettuce. Sow radishes 
and small salads in a shady part of the garden. Water 
seeds as well as plants. Put out celery, if not done be- 
fore. Pull onions, and keep in a dry open apartment ; also 
garlic and shallots. It is not too late for cucumbers, melons, 
squashes, &c. ; thin those of last month's growth to three or 
four on a hill. Thin okra, and hoe often. Support tomatoes 
with sticks ; put one stick in the middle, and three or four 
round each bush. 

Trees, Shrubs, and Flowers. It is very important that 
neglected trees should be trimmed. Thin crowded fruit. 
Water twice a week, if dry. 



YOUR PREMISES. YOUR NEIGHBORS. 

Be as ambitious for neatness about your dwelling as in it ; 
and look with a jealous scrutiny at your pump. Is it not the 
height of ingratitude, that dirt should be allowed to collect 
around the spot which is the very fountain of purity ? If 
the water is hard, keep a tub or barrel half full of ashes, and 
fill up with water as you want it. A gallon of strong lye 
put into a large kettle of hard water, will make it as soft as 
rain-water. 



THE lady's A2sXUAL REGISTER. 85 

Do not be afraid of going into stables, wood-houses, &c. 
Your husband has enough to do to provide the means of fill- 
ing them, Avithout the care of keeping them in order. You, 
being constantly on the spot, can see when articles want re- 
pairing. A nail driven in at the right moment, or a lock 
repaired on an out-house, may save many dollars and much 
fretting. Keep the front of your house clean, by daily 
sweeping. 

Do not annoy your neighbors by noisy pets or anything 
else ; but treat the poorest among them with consideration. 
It is pleasant to look out of one's windows upon friends. I 
once knew a gentleman who was annoyed by a hen of his 
neighbor's, which flew over the fence into his garden. In- 
stead of catching the hen, cutting its wings, and sending 
the culprit home with a kind message, he wrung its neck 
and threw^ it over the fence. Now this I call not neigh- 
borly. 

The system of borrowing too frequently, is apt to destroy 
kind neighborhood. Why is there such an absence of step- 
ladders, wheelbarrows, bed-keys, in the world ? It Avould be 
amusing to count the number of these articles, as compared 
with the number of affluent families who have e\erj other 
luxury. There is a good college joke of a great borrower, 
who was constantly sending to his classmates for their bel- 
lovrs. One of them being somewhat tired of lending, told 
him one day that he was sorry he could not let them 
go out of the room, but that he might sit by his fire and 
blow. 

Let your premises show as much taste as your means will 
permit. If you cannot paint, you can whitewash ; and if 
you cannot whitewash, you can plant pretty vines to cover 
your fences. It will inspire your servants with a love of 
neatness, should 3'ou cultivate it in their sight ; and if you

feel as I do, you will love to see them sitting in a clean yard, 
after the labor of the day is over, with the pleasant moonlight 
flickering through the leaves of the shade you have planted. 



COOKING. 

Time for boiling certain Meats. Neat's tongue should be boiled 
full three hours. If it has been in salt long, it is well to soak it over 
night in cold water. Put it in to boil when the water is cold. If 
you boil it in a small pot, it is well to change the water when it has 
boiled an hour and a half 5 the fresh water should boil before the 
half-cooked tongue is put in again. It is nicer for being kept in a 
cool place a day or two after being boiled. 

Nearly the same rules apply to salt beef. A six-pound piece of 
corned beef should boil full three hours ; and salt beef should be 
boiled four hours. The salter meat is, the longer it should be boiled. 
If very salt, it is well to put it in soak over night : change the water 
while cooking ; and observe the same rules as in boiling tongue. If 
it is intended to be eaten when cold, it is a good plan to put it be- 
tween clean boards, and press it down with heavy weights for a day 
or two. 

A small leg of bacon should be boiled three hours ; ten pounds, 
four hours ; twelve pounds, five hours. 

All meat should boil moderately ; furious boiling injures the 
flavor. 

Fresh meat should never be put in to cook till the water boils ; 
and it should be boiled in as little water as possible : otherwise the 
flavor is injured. 

Mutton, enough for a family of five of six, should boil an hour 
and a half. 

A leg of lamb should boil an hour, or little more than an hour, 
perhaps. Mrs.chiid.

A LAMENT, OVER A FAILING MUSICAL VOICE. 
By Caroline Gilman. 

"WTiere art thou, friend of former years, 

Thou pleasant voice of song, 
That gushed from out my inmost heart 

In carol soft or strong ? 

Oh, I remember still thy lays, 

Trilled off with thoughtless glee, 
Amid my toys or garden M-alks, 

Or 'neath the spreading tree. 

I can recall the nursery song 

That soothed my kitten's cries, 
And that low note that sought to shut 

My dolly's staring eyes. 

And I remember, as a dream, 

My mother's tender pride. 
When calling her young singing-bird 

To warble by her side. 

With head erect, hands clasped before, 

And courtesy fitly train' d, 
I gave the shrill, ambitious song 

With voice unduly strain'd. 

And humbler, holier notes than these. 

Come back through distant years. 
The hymning at that mother's knee, 

Who bless' d me through her tears. 

Then higher feeling rose and grew 

With strong, profound control, 
Till rich romance swept o'er my life, 

And lent my voice a soul. 



S8 THE lady's annual REGISTER. 

On sunny hills, in woodland depths, 

The silver stream along, 
'Mid meadow flowers and orchard fruits 

I poured the dreamy song. 

And when the moon, with chastened smile, 
Look'd downward on mine eye. 

And her soft radiance thrilled my frame. 
It rose in ecstacy. 

Kext Friendship woke my heart's young tune. 

As, hand by hand still prest, 
Her eyes, like eyes of cherubim, 

Look'd deep within my breast. 

And Love stole near, and as he stirr'd 

That heart's unruffled sea, 
Tears, smiles, and sighs alternate rose. 

Struggling for melody. 

Who hath been young, nor owned that love 

Is like the fabled ray, 
Waking the spirit into song 

As breaks life's sunny day? 

Who hath been young, nor felt the heart 
Thrill like a breeze-touch' d lyre. 

When love has swept its sleeping chords, 
Awaking new desire ? 

Then came the carol here and there, 
Heard from the busy wife, — 

Snatches of song that lighten up 
The toils and cares of life. 

And then the gentle lullaby 
That sooth'd the babe to rest, 

As, sinking like a twilight flower. 
He nestled on my breast, 



THE lady's annual REGISTER. 89 

Unconscious of the eyes that gazed 

With fond devotion there, 
Unconscious of the broken song 

That formed itself to prayer. 

Nor be thy sacred notes forgot, 

Voice of the bygone days ! 
The lay of evening penitence, 

The morning hymn of praise. 

Nor yet th' inspiring, holy s-u'ell 

Of sabbath's blessed chime, 
Which bore, upon its upward wing, 

The cares of earth and time. 

Oh, truant voice of former song, 

Return, return again ! 
My heart is young — awake once more 

Thy glad and solemn strain. 

The bright round hills are standing still. 

The woodland depths are green. 
The orchards glow with autumn fruit. 

And streamlets glide between : 

The lovely moon still mounts her car 

Flooding the earth and sea, — 
Voice of my youth, on that bright ray 

Why glid'st thou not to me ? 

Friendship is true, and love still warm, 

And Sabbath hymns are sung ; 
With passionate appeal I ask. 

Why leave thy lyre unstrung ? 

How silent ! —but methinks I hear 

A whisper from afar, 
That tells me we shall meet again 

Where new-cloth'' d voices are !

And mine, mine onn, will sound once more 

Amid the eternal choir, 
And swell in loftier, sweeter strains,

ANECDOTES. 

A certain gentleman, not well skilled in orthography, requested 
his friend to send him too monkies. The t not being distinctly writ- 
ten, the friend concluded his too was intended for 100. "With diffi- 
culty, he procured fifty, wliich he sent ; adding, 'the other fifty, 
agreeable to your order, will be forwarded as soon as possible.' 

A Frenchman having frequently heard the word frts$ made use of 
to imply persuade, as ' press that gentleman to take some refresh- 
ment,' ' press him to stay to-night,' thought he would shew his tal- 
ents by using a synonymous term 5 and therefore made no scruple, 
one evening, to cry out in company, ' Pray, squeeze that lady to sing.' 

A gentleman once obser^dng that a person famous in the m.usical 
line led a very abandoned life, ' Aye,' replied a wag. • the whole tenor 
of his life has been base.' 

A person remarkable for his stupidit}' and indolence, was desired 
by his wife not to be gone so much, as she was afraid to be left 
alone. 'Poh!' said he: 'Nought is never in danger.' 'I know 
that,' said she ; 'but Nought's wife is.' 

A gentleman having put out a candle by accident one night, or- 
dered his waiting-man (who was a simple being) to light it again in 
the kitchen. 'But take care, John,' added he, 'that you do not hit 
yourself against anything in the dark.' IMindful of the caution, 
John stretched out both his arms at full length before him : but un- 
luckily a door, which stood half open, passed between his hands and 
struck him a woful blow upon the nose. ' Dickens ! ' muttered he, 
when he recovered his senses a little, ' I always heard that I had a 
plaguy long nose, but I vow I never have thought before that it was 
longer than mv arm.'

nearest the root. Cress is sov^m from April to September — 
of easy culture, and well known for its uses as a garnish 
and with salads. Leek (a species of onion) should be sown 
from April to August, and treated generally like onions — in 
light, rich soil : as the plants grow strong, draw the earth up 
around them, by which means the bulbs will be blanched, 
and become much sweeter. Parsley is sown from April to 
August ; the seed seldom vegetates in a less time than five 
weeks after sowing ; and it is recommended to soak the seed

Do not plant, unless in a shady place, and give plenty of 
water. You may plant snap-beans, but soak them in water 
six hours before planting ; and water earth before you plant. 
Put out May cabbage plants, and sow more seed. Trans- 
plant cauliflower, if not done. Sow, if wanted. Transplant 
leeks ; take up onions, and dry. Carrots and parsneps may 
succeed, if it should be showery. At the close of the month, 
sow endive, for first crop ; also, turneps. Sow lettuce twice 
this month. Middle of the month, plant out first crop cel-

every week, where they are daily wanted. Sow spinage. 
Nothing will now thrive without water.

sweet potatoes thus. They make a bed of fresh stable ma- 
nure, as you would a hot-bed for forcing other vegetables : 
on this bed they lay their sweet potatoes, without cutting, 
about eight or ten inches apart, and cover them with well 
rotted manure, or compost made very fine, to the depth of 
six inches. The potato will soon sprout and come up. AVhen 
two or three inches high, they draAv the sprouts, by running 
the finger down to the potato, and breaking them ofl^ there. 
These sprouts they transplant in a hill with a dibble ; and if 



THE lady's annual REGISTER. 93 

the earth is not sufficiently wet, water the plants two or three 
times. A gill of water to a plant will be sufficient for a 
watering ; and in five or six daj's the plants vnll have taken 
root. Care must be taken to insert the plants as deep in the 
hill as they were in the bed when drawn. By this mode of 
bedding and transplanting, larger and more abundant crops 
are obtained. A bushel thus bedded, will plant five acres of 
ground. 



CHILDREN. 

Few families in the United States can afford room and 
attendance for a nursery. Our little ones may be seen on 
all parts of our premises tottling about in their visits of cu- 
riosity, from object to object, partially under the mother's 
eye ; while their ' hair-breadth escapes ' show how Provi- 
dence has adjusted circumstances to their helplessness. Dr. 
Alcott has written an admirable book called ' The Young 
Mother ;' but except those whom wealth has raised above the 
business of life, how few can avail themselves of it. Most 
mothers have not the time to use the excellent precautions it 
recommends. Young and inexperienced, they go on under 
the simple direction of common-sense and a kind of ne- 
cessity. To those who can read and act upon Dr. Alcott's 
book, it A\dll prove a treasure. 

One simple charge may be given to mothers. Dispense 
with ceremonious company altogether, unless you have a 
separate apartment for your children. The two objects of 
entertaining visiters and taking care of the little ones, can- 
not be attained without wearing doA^m your soul and body, 
and making you either irritated against your children or 
cold to your guests. Some little automaton may be induced, 
perhaps, to sit still in a chair and do penance ; but children

will generally take advantage of your engagedness with 
others to perpetrate some extra mischief. Bobby will chmb 
up the back of a chair and lose his balance ; Lucy's hand 
will clutch Sally's ringlets ; Tim will get at the bellows and 
puff at the ashes — Sue thrust her fingers into the sugar- 
bowl — Dick maltreats Fanny's doll, and Fanny a bore ; 
Dick drums with a fork — while mama keeps up a rattling 
thunder of ' Be still I — ■ do n't you dear — let alone,' &:c. 



MAKE YOUR O AV N BEDS, YOUNG LADIES. 

' "When 3'ou leave school, take care of your own chamber. 
It is a good plan to strip the clothes off your bed and shake 
it up as soon as you rise from it ; by doing it then, your cap 
protects your hair from lint and feathers ; and being lightly 
clothed, your movements are perfectly free, and the glow oc- 
casioned by exercise, makes you on a cold morning feel less 
dread of cold water. You can finish making your bed and 
dust your furniture after you are dressed, and before break- 
fast, if there is time ; but if not, return and do it as soon as 
possible after that meal is over.' m^s. Farrax 

This is good advice ; but many persons become so chilled 
as not to be able to use their hands in dressing, after so cold 
an operation ; to such, a pair of warm gloves and fur shoes 
would be a great comfort. It is not every young person 
who knows how to make a bed, and much of the comfort of 
life depends upon it. 

Directions for making a Bed. Place a chair at the foot 
of the bed. Then take hold of the spread at the top, and 
draw it do\\-n, and turn it over the chair ; the same with the 
blankets and sheets : by this means you will always know 



THE lady's annual REGISTER. 95 

which is the upper sheet and which part has been to the 
head. (Many persons draw the bed-clothes off together, 
and throw them on a chair or trunk to any part of the room, 
which produces confusion in returning them.) Beat up the 
pillows and bolster, and place them in the air while you 
beat up the bed. When ready to shake the bed, take hold 
of one corner at a time with both hands, and get the feathers 
in the centre ; then take hold of the tick in the centre, and 
shake the feathers back again ; then insert both hands under 
the bed at the side, and with a firm hold turn it quickly over. 
Spread on each article, and tuck under the bed separately. 
Then, with a good conscience, you will have pleasant dreams. 
N. B. It is economy of time for two persons to make a bed 
together. Perhaps the best plan is to have no feather-bed. 



RECIPES. 

Sponge Cake. The nicest way to make sponge-cake or diet bread, 
is the weight of six eggs in sugar, the weight of four eggs in flour, 
a little rose-water. The whites and j^olks should be beaten thor- 
oughly and separately. The eggs and sugar should be well beaten 
together ; but after the flour is sprinkled, it should not be stirred a 
moment longer than is necessary to mix it well ; it should be poured 
into the pan, and got into the oven with all possible expedition. 
Twenty minutes is about long enough to bake. Not to be put in till 
some other articles have taken olT the first few minutes of furious 
heat. 

Dough-nuts. One pint of flour, half a pint of sugar, three eggs, a 
piece of butter as big as an eg^, and a tea-spoonful of dissolved 
pearlash. When you have no eggs, a gill of lively j^east will do ; 
but in that case they must be made over night. Cinnamon, rose- 
water, or lemon brandy if you have it. If you use part lard instead 
of butter, add a little salt. Not put in till the fat is very hot. The 
more fat they are fried in, the less they will soak fat. 

Common Wedding Cake. Four pounds of flour, three pounds of 



98 THE lady's annual register. 

butter, three pounds of sugar, four pounds of currants or raisins, 
twenty-four eggs, half a pint of brandy or lemon brandy, one ounce 
of mace, and three nutmegs. A little molasses makes it dark col- 
ored, which is desirable. Half a pound of citron improves it ; but 
it is not necessary. To be baked from two and a half to three hours. 
After the oven is cleared, it is well to shut the door for eight or ten 
minutes, to let the violence of the heat subside before cake or bread 
is put in. 

Hard Gingerbread. One pound of flour, half a pound of butter 
and sugar rubbed into it ; half a pound of sugar ; a great spoonful 
of ginger, or more, according to its strength ; a spoonful of rose- 
w^ater, and a handful of caraway seed. Well beat up. Kneaded 
stiff enough to roll out and bake on flat pans. Bake twenty or thirty 
minutes. 

Cup Cake. This is about as good as pound cake, and is cheaper. 
One cup of butter, two cups of sugar, three cups of flour, and four 
eggs, W'CU beat together, and baked in pans, or cups. Bake twenty 
minutes, and no more. 

Tea Cake. There is a kind of tea-cake still cheaper. Three cups 
of sugar, three eggs, one cup of butter, one cup of milk, a spoonful 
of dissolved pearlash, and four cups of flour, well beat up. If it is 
so stifl" that it will not stir easily, add a little more milk.

GENTLENESS. 
By Anna Maria Wells. 

It is the bright autumnal moon, 

"Walking her nightly way ; 

Unveiled is seen 

Her face serene, 

Unclouded as the day. 

Her tranquil eye is on the earth, 
And on the slumbering deep : 

Her quiet smile, — 

It doth beguile 
Like an infant in its sleep. 

The tempest rises in its wrath ; 
Red lightning rides the cloud ; 

The waves up-leap 

From their troubled sleep. 
And the winds are strong and loud. 

They bid the forests bow their heads ; 
They tear the giant tree ; 

They rush and roar 

Along the shore 
And cross the heaving sea. 

The beauteous moon looks calmly on, 
And her brow is meekly bent 

Behind the shroud 

Of each passing cloud, 
Till the raging storm is spent. 



THE lady's annual REGISTER. 

She veils that pale but placid brow 
Till the strife is heard no more ; 

And then, serene, 

With vestal mien 
Walks lovely as before. 

'T is thus I' ve seem where Passion holds 
His dark tempestuous sway, 
Sweet Gentleness 
AVith power to bless, 
Calm all the clouds away. 



&0D OUR FATHER. 
By Caroline Oilman. 

Is there a lone and dreary hour 

When worldly pleasures lose their power ? • 

My Father ! let me turn to thee, 

And set each thought of darkness free. 

Is there a time of racking grief, 
Which scorns the prospect of relief? — 
My Father ! break the cheerless gloom, 
And bid my heart its calm resume. 

Is there an hour of peace and joy, 
When hope is all my soul's employ ? — 
My Father ! still my hopes will roam, 
Until they rest with thee their home. 

The noon-tide blaze, the midnight scene, 
The dawn, or twilight's sweet serene, 
The glow of life, the dying hour, 
Shall own my Father's grace and power.

Kitchen Garden. Take care of choice seeds. Look to 
your vines for pickles ; and while enjoying the fruits of the 
garden, do not let weeds get ahead. A cheap method of 
preserving cucumber plants from the small fly or bug which 
attacks them frequently soon after the leaf appears, and some- 
times later, and leaves little more than the skeleton of the 
leaf, is to break off the stalks of the onion which have been 
set out in the spring, and stick down five or six of them in 
each hill of cucumbers ; and the bug will immediatel}^ leave 
them : it would be well, after a few days, to renew them ; 
but one application has frequently been found to be com- 
pletely effectual. 

Trees, Shrubs, and Flowers. Save the stones of fine 
peaches, plums, &c., if not for yourself, for others. Water 
dahlias, and other plants. ' Every merchant, mechanic, or 
professional man, should have some garden spot, in which 
he can spend an hour of every summer's morning. In that

hour he may not gain as much money perhaps as he would 
at his desk; but he will find what is better — pure air, 
sweet flowers, gentle exercise, and in the result of the whole, 
good spirits and reneAved health.' 



Soutt)ern ffi^atlren e:alentrar. 

Kitchen Garden. Sow peas for autumn crop ; charleton 
and golden hotspur are best. If the weather is dry, soak 
them eight or ten hours in soft water. Plant bush or snap 
beans, for fall crop. They will come in for pickling. Any 
time this month, sow cabbage seed ; but there is no use in 
it, unless you shade and water. Sow onions at the end of 
the month, to transplant in October. Sow spinage, for No- 
vember crop. Transplant more celery. Sow turneps for 
winter use. Hoe turneps before they get the size of a cent. 
Plant potatoes, lettuce, and radishes ; but water every eve- 
ning. 

Trees, Shrubs, and Flowers. Sow lupine and hollyhocks, 
as in February. Stock July Flowers. Plant tulips ; they 
must be taken up every year. Sow poppies. Use strong 
soap-suds, with a syringe, on grapes, to prevent mildew. — 
Fruit-trees from seed: The seeds of old trees should by no 
means be used ; at least there will be no advantage in using 
them, however excellent their fruit. The important point is, 
not merely to use the seeds of a seedling but to use its first 
seeds. * It is in the seminary of the first seeds of the newest 
varieties of fruit trees, that we should expect to find the more 
perfect fruits.' ' Seeds from an ancient variety tend toward 
a wild state,' and 'have less chance of becoming perfect.'

NEEDLE -WORK. 

Cultivate a love of needle-work in your family. "What- 
ever may be the mental improvement of a woman, she is 
made happier by this occupation. A young lady who su- 
perintends her own or her mother's clothing, will have sweet, 
cheerful thoughts spring up in her mind, unless she is dis- 
eased, or actually courts gloomy ideas. It is an odious sight 
to witness a family idle of a winter evening ; and no less 
beautiful a spectacle, when a circle surround a table, employ- 
ing their needles while one reads aloud. Let one of the 
party provide a map and dictionary for reference, and the 
knowledge obtained in an evening will be surprising. Look- 
ing out the meaning of words, makes a good pause and stim- 
ulates thought and criticism. 

It is not probable that sewing ever checks the bright and 
thinking faculties. The dull will be dull still, whether they 
read libraries or ply the needle ; and this employment cer- 
tainly gives a zest to after reading, to those who really love 
books. ' How should women bless their needle for rescuing 
them from the temptations which assail the other sex. Bright 
and innocent little implement, whether plied over tasteful 
luxuries, or gaining the poor pittance of a day, thou art 
equally the friend of her whose visions tend to wander amid 
the regions of higher abstractions, and of her whose thoughts 
are pinned down to the tread-mill of thy minute progress. 
Quiet rescuer from clubs and midnight revels, amid the mi- 
nor blessings of woman's lot, thou shalt not be forgotten ! 
Still come, and let thy fairy wand shine on her ; still lend 
an ambitious joy to the playthings of the girl ; stiU move 
unconsciously under the glittering smile of the maiden plan- 
ning thy triumphant results ; still beguile the mother, whose 



102 THE lady's annual REGISTER. 

thought roves to her boy on the distant ocean, or the daugh- 
ter, watching by ihe sick bed of one who has heretofore toiled 
for her ; still soothe the long, drearj^ moments of faithful 
love, and though a tear sometimes fall on thy shining point, 
it shall not gather the rust of despair, since employment is 
thy dower.' 



RECIPES. 

Alamode Beef. Tie up a round of beef, so as to keep it in shape ; 
make a stuffing of grated bread, suet, sweet herbs, quarter of an 
ounce of nutmeg, a few cloves pounded, yolk of an egg. Cut holes 
in the beef and put in the stuffing, leaving about half the stuffing to 
be made into balls. Tie the beef up in a cloth, just cover it with 
water, let it boil an hour and a half ; then turn it, and let it boil an 
hour and a half more. Turn out the liquor, and put some skewers 
across the bottom of the pot, and lay the beef upon them to brown ; 
turn it, that it may brown on both sides. Put a pint of claret and 
some allspice and cloves into the liquor, and boil some balls, made of 
the stuffing, in it. 

Something that n-ill not lie heavy on the stomach. If people wish to 
be economical, they should take some pains to ascertain what are the 
cheapest pieces of meat to buy ; not merely those which are cheapest 
in price, but those which go farthest when cooked. That part of 
mutton called the rack, which consists of the neck and a few of the 
rib bones below, is cheap food. Four pounds will make a dinner for 
six people. The neck cut into pieces, and boiled slowly an hour and 
a quarter, in little more than water enough to cover it, makes very 
nice broth. A great-spoonful of rice should be washed and thro^\^l 
in with the meat. About twenty minutes before it is done, put in a 
little thickening, and season with salt, pepper, and sifted summer- 
savory, or sage. The bones below the neck, broiled, make a nice 
mutton-chop. If your family is small, a rack of mutton will make 
you two dinners, — broth once, and mutton-chop with a few nice sli- 
ces of salt pork, for another ; if your family consist of six or seven, 
you can have two dishes for a dinner. If you boil the whole rack 
for broth, there will be some left for mince-meat. mib. Chiid.

TEMPTATION RESISTED.

And passion's surges dashing here, 

In threatening fury rave. 

Look on — fear not — a power 
Stronger than these is nigh, 

And in this overwhelming hour, 
Its ^\Testling strength will try. 

And if thou seek'st for aid,

In fair proportions, fitly laid, 

Upon thy harass'd breast. 

Each pure and holy thought, 
In earth's wild deluge driven, 

Shall to this ark of peace be brought, 
AVith pinions plumed for Heaven. 

And Hope to that shall spring, 
And Faith with eyes so fair, 

Shaking earth's waters from their wins 
And come and nestle there.

THE SABBATH.

We bless thee for this sacred day. 
Thou who hast every blessing given. 

Which sends the dreams of earth away 
And yields a glimpse of opening Heaven. 

Rich day of holy, thoughtful rest, 
May we improve thy calm repose. 

And in God's service heal'd and bless'd, 
Forget the world, its joys and woes. 

Lord, may thy truth upon the heart 
Now fall and dwell as heavenly dew, 

And flowers of grace in freshness start 
Where once the weeds of error grew. 

May prayer now lift her sacred wings, 
Contented with that aim alone, 

Which bears her to the King of kings, 
And rests her at his sheltering throne.

In your beautiful barks, too quickly ye glide, 

With your light tinted sails, through ether's blue tide. 

We have roam'd, we have roam'd, all reckless and free, 
O'er earth's boundless regions, its treasures to see ; 
We have hover'd afar o'er the wide western main, 
To the land where the forests in free grandeur reign : 
We have shadow'd the spot where the glassy lake gleams, 
And hung our dark spells o'er the flood's thousand streams. 

We have knelt, we have knelt, to the mountain's proud crest ; 

And spread our white shroud o'er the valley's pure breast ; 

We have kiss'd the wet cheek of the lone waterfall, 

And cared not to stay, although ceaseless its call ; 

Then cheer'd the frail flower, sick of Phoebus' bright face, 

And wak'd with our presence a magical grace. 

Summer clouds, summer clouds, why hurry away ? 
Still wreathe with your garlands the brow of the da)'' : 
Pass not yet, pass not yet on your feathery flight, 
But rest in your beauty, ye children of light ! 
Still hover around us, and stir your soft wings ; 
Nor long to glide from us, like earth's lovely things.

SEPTEMBER. 




Kitchen Garden. Earth up celery, and do not bruise the 
plants. This must be done on a diy day. Gather cucumbers 
for pickling. Cauliflowers should be sown late in August 
and September, for early ones next spring ; in April or May, 
for late ; treated generally like cabbages ; should be trans- 
planted three feet apart, in a very rich and rather a moist 
loam ; a rich soil is indispensable for their successful cul- 
ture. In order to blanch them handsomely, the leaves must 
be closed together at the top, and tied gently. This delicious 
vegetable, as well as the broccoli, is deserving of more gen- 
eral cultivation. The heads or flowers of the plant, when 
boiled in a clean linen cloth, and served up with mehed but- 
ter, form a most delicate vegetable dish. It is a great favor- 
ite in Europe. Dr. Johnson observed, ' Of all the flowers 
of the garden, give me the cauliflower.' 

Fruits, Shrubs, and Flowers. Tie up delicate shrubs and 



108 THE lady's annual REGISTER. 

flowers against the wind. The close of this month is the 
time to begin to transplant biennials and perennials ; moist 
weather is the best for this object. The proper season for 
transplanting most bulbous roots, is in August, September, 
and October. The only advantage to be gained by taking 
up bulbs after blooming, (tulips excepted) is either to divide 
the roots when too numerous, or to renew a worn-out soil ; 
neither of which can occur oftener than once in three or four 
years. Tulips and hyacinths, when taken up after bloom- 
ing, and after the foliage is decayed, may be kept from the 
ground till the middle of October. Delicate and tender 
bulbs, as the feraria tigrida, &c., may be planted in pots in 
November, or they may be kept in dry sand until April, 
(which is best) and then planted in pots or open ground. 
In either case they must be secured from frost. As to tulips 
and hyacinths, in order to preserve their beauty in perfection, 
the nicer varieties should be taken up, air-dried, and re- 
planted annually. 



Kitchen Garden. Draw up earth round last month's peas. 
Hoe bush beans. You may still plant. Transplant cabba- 
ges. You may sow for Christmas cabbages. But seed, as 
well as plants, must be watered and shaded. Some persons 
prefer seeds from Europe at this late season. Sow cauli- 
flowers ; they may live through the winter and serve you in 
May. Sow onions, turneps, (if not already done) radishes, 
&c., and water in the evening. 

Fruits, Shrubs, and Flowers. Plant out strawberries in 



THE lady's annual REGISTER. 109 

beds or borders, and water faithfully. Sow lupins, and car- 
nations, as in April. Sow china pink, hollyhock. Plant 
h3^acinths a span deep; tulips, as in August; sweet-wil- 
liams, as in April. 



THE OFFICE, STUDY, AND SHOP. 

If your husband's business apartment is under the same 
roof with you, you may have some temptations to annoy 
him, which it would be well to guard against. Be careful 
how you intrude on his time. Keep children away. Do 
not permit servants to carry messages which you can possi- 
bly attend to ; and beware of showing any influence over 
him by personal visits in business hours, unless at his re- 
quest. 

But you can do something by a quiet and general super- 
vision for his comfort. Give up the service of one of your 
attendants cheerfully when required, and show yourself ready 
to aid him in any pressure of care. 

There is one point, however, to which married women 
should hold tenaciously; the attendance of their husbands 
at meals. A lady may arrange those for his convenience ; 
but being so arranged, let her mildly, but firmly, insist on 
his presence. Nothing can be more pernicious to all parties 
than for families to be separated day after day. The father 
of a family has much to be responsible for, who does not in 
the daily progress of his household see their bodies and minds 
expand and develop ; and how can he do that, if he snatches 
only a few moments a day or on the Sabbath for this pur- 
pose ? By and by he will wonder at the little influence he 
has over them, and regret that the office, the plantation, the 



110 THE lady's annual REGISTER. 

Study, the farm, or the shop, has withdrawn him from inter- 
ests higher than any other. 



PUDDINGS AND CAKES. 

The salt should ahvays be washed from butter, when it is to be 
used in anything that has sugar for an ingredient, and also from that 
which is melted to grease any kind of mould for baking ; otherwise, 
there will be a disagreeable salt taste on the outside of the article 
baked. Raisins should be stoned and cut in two, and have some 
flour sifted over them ; stir them gently in the flour, and take them 
out free from lumps ; the small quantity that adheres to them will 
prevent their sticking together, or falling in a mass to the bottom. 
Eggs must be fresh, or they will not beat well ; it is belter to sepa- 
rate the yolks from the whites always, though it is a more trouble- 
some process ; but for some things it is essential to do so : when they 
are to be mixed with milk, let it cool after boiling, or the eggs will 
poach • and only set it on the fire a few minutes to take ofl' the raw 
taste of the eggs, stirring it all the time. Currants require washing 
in many waters to cleanse them ; they must be picked and well dried, 
or they will stick together. Almonds should be put in hot water till 
the skins will slip off, which is called blanching ; they must always 
be pounded with rose or orange-flower water, to prevent their oiling. 
When cream is used, put it in just before the mixture is ready ; much 
beating will decompose it. Before a pudding or cake is begun, every 
ingredient necessary for it must be ready ; when the process is re- 
tarded by neglecting to have them prepared, the article is injured. 
The oven must be in a proper state, and the paste in the dishes or 
moulds ready for such things as require it. Promptitude is necessary 
in all our actions, but never more so than when engaged in making 
cakes and puddings. When only one or two eggs are to be used, 
cooks generally think it needless to beat them ; it is an error : eggs 
injure everything, unless they are made light before they are used. 
Cloths for boiling puddings should be made of German sheeting, or 
some article equally thick;

LADIES SOCIETIES. 

One of the peculiar features of the age, is the combination of 
women into associations for charitable, literary, and social purposes ; 
even patriotism has not been overlooked, as the tea-drinkings in some 
portions of New-England on the fourth of July will testify. These 
are probably the leading-strings which the sex will use until education 
assimilates them more closely with the stronger minds of men. The 
charitable societies are too widely spread and well known, to require 
any description. There is, however, in Cambridge (Mass.) a very 
pleasant association of ladies and gentlemen, called the Book Club, 
which unites a literary and social character unexceptionably. It is 
composed of twenty families ; and a meeting of the members takes 
place the first Thursday evening of each month, at their respective 
houses, in regular order. A subscription of five dollars per annum 
is paid by every family ; and this amount is laid out in the purchase 
of recent publications of any value. These books are circulated in 
regular succession to all the members of the club. A certain num- 
ber of days are allowed for the reading of a book ; at the expiration 
of the time, it is forwarded to another member , and thus they are 
kept in circulation through the year. Tf the book is kept over the 
time allowed, a fine is laid at five cents per day, as long as it may be 
retained. This regulation has a tendency to make the members 
punctual. At the annual meeting, the members have a sale of the 
books on hand, by an auction among themselves ; and the proceeds 
of the sale are appropriated to the purchase of new books for the 
following year. This association has existed several years, and it 
has been found to exercise a very happy influence on society. The 
evening on which they meet, passes in agreeable conversation ; and 
as the refreshments are simple, and give little trouble in the prepara- 
tion, there is less of formality and ceremony than in most parties. 
Strangers are invited, and it affords them an opportunity of seeing 
the refined and literary society of Cambridge. The members are 
chosen by ballot, and the choice must be unanimous ; by this ar- 
rangement, great harmony prevails ; and it preserves the character 
of a select society. The circumstance that the same books are read 
and enjoyed by so many, gives an interest to the members, afibrds 



112 THE lady's annual REGlSTElt. 

topics of conversation of a cheerful nature, and a knowledge of the 
passing literature of the day, at little expense of time or money. 



A husband's and father s trials. 

My wife is one of the smartest and best women in the world ; and 
her faults are of such a trifling nature, that it seems almost childish 
to mention them ; and yet they are so annoying to me, as very much 
to diminish the sum of my matrimonial happiness. She does not 
consider that I am rather 'set in my way,' and like to keep all my 
affairs in order. But from her extreme good nature and easy dispo- 
sition, she is constantly interfering with my habits. She allows the 
children to take my combs, and my hair-brush, and my sponge, in- 
stead of providing some for their own use. My clothes-brush is never 
to be found in its place ; my ink-stand is taken out of my desk, and 
when I inquired for it the other day, I was told by my wife, she had 
lent it to the cook, and it was in the upper chamber. My newspaper 
is often torn up, to singe a chicken, before I have half read it through. 
If I lay my gloves down, they vanish. My horse-whip I can never 
find, because the boys are e:J"cessively fond of riding on a stick, and 
they have no pleasure in riding unless they can have a real whip. 

When these things are missing, and I begin to fret, the whole fam- 
ily are put in motion. Such an opening of closets and drawers, 
such a scrambling up stairs and down, such an overturn in the whole 
house, that you would imagine me a perfect tyrant. My wife (a 
gentle creature usually) seizing little James and giving him a smart 
shake, will say, 'You little trial, why did you not put your father's 
whip in its place when 5'ou had done playing with it ? ' 

' I forgot to, mama.' 

' Well, never take anything belonging to your father ; see, he is 
obliged to go without his whip.' 

James looks serious a moment ; but as soon as I have left the 
house, while his mother is ' putting things to rights,' after the com- 
motion, he catches up the ramrod of my fowling-piece, and rides 
away on it to school, and it is forgotten. 

Yesterday being a fine autumn day, I hurried through my business 
for the purpose of going out a shooting with a gentleman who is one 



THE lady's annual REGISTER. 113 

of the punctual sort, and who never varies a moment from the time 
appointed. 

My gun wanted a little cleaning, and my ramrod was gone. I 
called out in a hurried tone, ' Wife, Avhere is my ramrod gone ? ' 

She could not tell — had not seen it. 

' Well,' said I, ' what is to be done now ? ' 

Nobody could give any account of it. At last James came in 
from school. 

' James,' said I, ' have you had my ramrod ? ' 

Yes, sir. I rode on it to school on Monday, and forgot it.' 

AM-ay he scampered, as well to get out of my reach, as to bring 
the ramrod. 

Sometimes I undertake to lock up my peculiar property, but it 
often happens that my wife wants the key for some purpose — for- 
gets to return it, and it is lost, and then I have to break open the 
lock. 

My wife feels very badly when these things happen ; and to do 
her justice, she tries very hard to keep things in order. If she could 
bear to have me point out her defects, and put her in the right way, 
she would soon have a systematic arrangement of her household 
affairs. If she could only be made to realize how much it would di- 
minish her own care, and prevent those outbreaks of temper in us 
both which put the whole family in a state of agitation, I should be 
a happy man. But she has so much sensibility that she cannot en- 
dure the least word of reproof or censure ; it mortifies her so much 
as to make her miserable ; and I would rather have everything in 
the house at ' sixes and sevens/ than to see her in tears. 



ANECDOTES. 

A minikin three-and-a-half-feet colonel, being one day at the drill, 
was examining a strapper, of six feet four. ' Come, fellow, hold up 
your head ; higher, fellow ! ' ' Yes, sir.' Higher, fellow — higher.' 
'What — so, sir?' 'Yes, fellow.' ' And am I always to remain so ! ' 
'Yes, fellow, certainly.' 'Why then, good bye, colonel, for I never 
shall see you again.' 

A Gascon was vaunting one day, that in his travels he had been

caressed wherever he went, and had seen all the great men through- 
out Europe. ' Have you seen the Dardanelles ? ' inquired one of the 
company'. 'Parbleu!' says he; 'I most surely have seen them, 
when I dined with them several times.' 

A stuttering coxcomb asked a barber's boy, 'Did you ever shave a 
monkey ? ' 'No, sir ; but if 5'ou will please to sit, I '11 t-t-t-try.' 

' Why, 3Ir. ,' said a tall fellow to a little person, who was in 

company with five or six huge men, ' I protest, you are so small, I 
did not see you before.' ' Very likely,' replied the little gentleman ; 
'I am like a four-pence-ha'-penny among six cents, not readily per- 
ceived, but worth the whole of them.' 



PARTING. 

Ev William Crafts. 



The sky be bright above. 

The ocean smooth below, 
And the wind be fair, my love, 

When o'er the seas you go ! 

The buoyant wave, in pride 
Its lovely charge shall bear : 

And guardian Heaven provide 
A passport for the fair. 

The joyous earth once more 

Thy beauteous form shall bless ; 

And friends upon the shore 
Await thy sweet caress. 

When hearts and hands entwine, 
In lands beyond the sea, 

Let one sweet thought be mine — 
Oh! then remember me.

OCTOBER. 




Xortijern C^articix Calentiat:. 

Kitchen Garden. Gather in garden roots, such as heets, 
carrots, parsneps, &c. &c. Look to your garret and cellar, 
where your herbs and vegetables are placed, as carefully as 
to your parlor. 

Fruits, Shrubs, and Flowers. Take care of bulbs ; take 
some good earth, and mix in a third of sand, a third of old 
manure, and put in flower jars or vases ; put in the roots, 
and leave out of doors until a frost, — then water them and 
put them in a waiTn room, for winter. Hyacinths, narcis- 
suses and jonquils, are pretty. The calla Ethiopica, daphne 
odora. and camellia, are very beautiful for parlor plants. 
Pick off the buds of japonicas, when too thick. Prepare 
garden for bulbs of various kinds.

Kitchen Garden. Sow cabbages, spinage, and radishes. 
Plant cabbages, onions, lettuces, cauhflowers, and oats. Hoe

cauliflowers, beans and carrots. Dress artichokes and aspar- 
agus ; give them a thorough examination for winter. 

Trees and Shrubs. Plant strawberries, raspberries, wild 
roses, monthly, box, evergreens, ranunculus, hydrangeas, and 
oleanders ; put out cuttings, with two buds above and two 
below ground — mellow earth, and no manure. Sow lark- 
spurs. 

Preparation of Soil for Seeds. The ground for the re- 
ception of fine seeds of vegetables, should be broken up in 
the preceding year, and well manured in autumn, and ren- 
dered fine in spring by repeated ploughing and harrowing or 
raking. Plough and manure deep for deep-rooted vegeta- 
bles ; but manure near the surface for all others. Potatoes 
and Indian corn answer well and produce large crops in 
ground newly broken up. A^ery fine seeds should be sown 
in a newly-prepared fresh soil, and covered only a quarter of 
an inch deep ; larger seeds deeper, in proportion to their 
size ; and the ground to be immediately trodden hard, or 
rolled with a hea^y roller. This enables the earth to pre- 
serve its moisture at its surface, where at the same time the 
seeds may receive the necessary degree of heat from the 
sun, and vegetate at once, striking root downwards. Fine 
seeds, if sown too deep, are liable to perish. 



THE CLOTHES-PRESS. 

Do not allow too many sheets, pillow-cases, towels, &c., 
to be about in daily use. Keep just enough, and count 
them every week, locking up the remainder for visiters, sick- 
ness, or accidents. Hem and mark knife cloths, and even 
lamp cloths, and let the latter be washed statedly. 

Let each person in the family, even children, own towels 



THE lady's annual REGISTER. 117 

marked with their names. Any one who will try this plan, 
will find how pleasant it is. It is advisable to extend this 
habit even to sheets and pillow-cases. Have enough table- 
cloths : it is better to see them coarse and clean, than fine 
and soiled. 



CLEANING LA INI PS. 

Ser^-ants are often reproached for not being thorough in 
this work, when the fault is in the apparatus. Give them 
sharp scissors. I scarcely know a family where old, dull scis- 
sors are not appropriated to cutting lamp-wicks, which are 
of a tough material. Throw the lamp-cloths into lye-water 
once a week, and boil them. Keep two sets of cloths, and 
two good towels, marked ' Lamp,' for cleaning shades, &c. 



SCHOOLS . 

Seminaries for young ladies are about being estabHshed 
under the natural progress of experience, which will produce 
an important effect over the whole countiy. The ephemeral 
character of schools heretofore, has been a tremendous evil. 
Our institutions should be on such a footing that a system 
may go on in case of the death or removal of a principal. 
Any information which may be received through the year 
relative to such institutions, will receive due notice in the 
Lady's Register, which will endeavor to furnish a complete 
list of established seminaries for girls throughout the United 
States, hereafter. 



118 THE lady's annual REGISTER. 

In the meantime, let those who are obliged to submit to 
the changes and chances of fluctuating schools, pay due re- 
spect to the mental guardians of their children, and aid them 
in their toilsome way by considerate attention and sympath}^. 
Never take a child away from school abruptly, without no- 
tice. If you think there are grounds for dissatisfaction, ex- 
press them candidly, but with all delicacy. Parents and 
guardians perhaps are not aware of how much importance 
to a teacher's feelings is a little courtesy, and how wounded 
they are by the sudden and unexpected withdrawal of a pu- 
pil to whom they have been probably conscientious instruct- 
ers, even when mistaken. 



HINTS ABOUT PICKLES. 

Muskmelons should be picked for mangoes when they are green 
and hard. They should be cut open after they have been in salt- 
water ten daj^s, the inside scraped out clean, and filled with mustard- 
seed, allspice, horse-radish, small onions, &c. and sewed up again. 
Scalding vinegar poured upon them. 

When walnuts are so ripe that a pin will go into them easily, they 
are ready for picking. They should be soaked twelve daj'^s in very 
strong cold salt and water, which has been boiled and skimmed. A 
quantity of vinegar, enough to cover them well, should be boiled 
Avith whole pepper, mustard-seed, small onions, or garlic, cloves, gin- 
ger, and horseradish ; this should not be poured upon them till it is 
cold. They should be pickled a few months before they are eaten. 
To be kept close covered, for the air softens them. The liquor is an 
excellent ketchup, to be eaten on fish. 

Cucumbers should be in weak brine three or four days after they 
are picked ; then they should be put in a tin or wooden pail of clean 
water, and kept slightly warm in the kitchen corner for two or three 
days. Then take as much vinegar as you think your pickle jar will 
hold, scald it with pepper, allspice, mustard-seed, flag-root, horserad- 



119 

ish, &c., if you happen to have them ; half of them will spice the 
pickles very well. Throw in a bit of alum as big as a walnut ; this 
serves to make pickles hard. Skim the vinegar clean, and pour it 
scalding hot upon the cucumbers. Brass vessels are not healthy for 
preparing anything acid. Red cabbages need no other pickling than 
scalding spiced vinegar poured upon them, and suffered to remain 
eight or ten days before you eat them. Some people think it im- 
proves them to keep them in salt and water twenty-four hours before 
they are pickled. 

A good mode of preparing green cucumbers, is to let them lie 
awhile in cold water immediately after being gathered ; then cut off 
the rind, and throw them into iced water ; then slice ; then sprinkle 
salt and pepper over them ; then pour on them a little vinegar , then 
(if you have the dyspepsia) throw them out of the window. 



ANE CDOTE S . 

A lady who gave herself great airs of importance, on being intro- 
duced to a gentleman for the first time, said, with much cool indiffer- 
ence, 'I think, sir, I have seen you somewhere.' ' Very likely you 
may,' replied the gentleman, with equal sang froid, ' as I have been 
there very often.' 

A peasant, being at confession, accused himself of having stolen 
some hay. The father-confessor asked him how many bundles he 
had taken from the stack. ' That is of no consequence,' replied the 
peasant ; ' you may set it down a wagon-load ; for my wife and I are 
going to fetch the remainder soon.' 

The late Dr. *****, M^alking down Broadway, during an illumina- 
tion, observed a boy breaking every window that had not a light in 
it. The doctor asked him how he dared to destroy people's property 
in that manner? '0,' said the urchin, 'it is all for the good of the 
trade : I am a glazier.' ' All for the good of the trade, is it ? ' said 
the Doctor, raising his cane and bringing it down rather heavily upon 
the boy's head ; 'there, you young rascal, that is good for my trade: 
I am a surgeon.' 

A fop, introducing his friend (a plain man) into company, said, 



120 THE lady's annual REGISTER. 

' Gentlemen, I assure you he is not so great a fool as he seems.' 
' No/ replied the gentleman ; ' that 's the difference between me and 
my friend.' 

A country 'squire introduced his baboon, in clerical habits, to say 
grace. A clergyman, who was present, immediately left the table, 
and asked ten thousand pardons for not remembering that his lord- 
ship's nearest relation was in orders. 

Two brothers having been sentenced to death, one was executed 
first. 'See,' the other brother said, < what a lamentable spectacle my 
brother makes ! in a few minutes I shall be turned off ; and then 
you will see a pair of spectacles.' 



HYMN. THE SABBATH. 

By Caroline Oilman. 

We would not slight our heaven-born dower, 

On this resplendent day ; 
Resplendent, though dark clouds may lower 

Above our earthly way. 

Resplendent — for the Saviour flies, 

With ' healing on his wings,' 
And o'er the depth where sorrow lies, 

An arch of glory flings. 

Resplendent ; for this truth is taught 
From morn to twilight's close — 

A truth, with life eternal fraught — 
This day, the Saviour rose. 

Resplendent ; for he reigns above, 

Beneath the eternal eye. 
And, dressed in robes of folding love. 

Awaits our flight on high.

And make us whollv thine. 



CITY CLOUDS AND STARS. 
Ey Caroline Oilman. 

' 1 was rear'd 

In the great city 

And saw nought lovely but the sky and stars.' Colerid<re. 

Ye bless'd me in my childish hour, 

White clouds, that, sailing by, 
Early awoke a spell of power, 

And won my gazing eye. 

And stars, ye glittering toys of Heaven, 

When on my couch I wept, 
To you my youthful thoughts were given. 

And thinking thus, I slept. 

Still blessingly 5'-e look below ; 

AVhen to the world's cold bourne 
Instinctively my footsteps go, 

My eyes to you upturn. 

The friends I 've lost, the lov'd, the fair, 

On those white foldings laid. 
Come floating on the parting air, 

In breezy light array'd. 

What though the city's serried wall 

Hides nature from my sight ? 
Upward I look, and there ye all 

Beam forth in lovely light. 



122 THE lady's annual registek. 

Oh, I forget forgetting friends, 
Nor weep at envious foes ; 

Your silent gaze a ray extends 
That heals me as it flows. 

Beautiful ministers of love, 
Take, take me upward too j 

I ask a Testing place above, 
To shine and bless with you ! 

Like you look down on aching eyes 
Tired with earth's fitful glare, 

And kindly float o'er bursting sighs, 
And hover o'er despair. 

Oh stars, and clouds, and azure ray, 
Day-da^vn, and evening-glow, 

Still o'er my fading fancy play, 
Still to my being grow ! 

And when death's winding-sheet shall fold 

Coldly my fading form. 
Thus glitter in the wintry cold. 

Or struggle through the storm, 

Or through the sultry summer day. 
Your fleecy mantle weave. 

Or stud with gems and colors gay, 
The sober brow of eve — 

Oh stars, and sky, and fleecy cloud, 

Wait ye, and silent wave 
Your standards 'mid the city's crowd, 

Above my trodden grave.

N0VE3IBER. 




If efficient gentlemen are not of your household, look to 
the cellars, and see if the cabbages, &c., now gathering or 
entered, are protected from frost. 

Trees, Shrubs, and Flowers. The best time for planting 
acorns and walnuts, as well as peaches, cherries, and other 
stone fruits, is in the fall of the year, as soon as they are 
ripe ; if they are kept long after becoming thoroughly ripe, 
they are apt to lose their vegetative principle. Cut the stalks 
from dahlias, and put the roots in a dry place. Continue 
planting bulbous roots, before frosts, and cover them with straw 
or litter. Get advice about best compost for your garden. 
Give each child a little gardening-spot, if you have room. 



Sout1)crn e^cirticu CaUntrar. 

Kitchen Garden. Sow peas, radishes, mustard, cresses, 
radish and rape. Plant beans, cabbages;, onions, lettuces, 
and oats. Dress artichokes and asparagus.

Trees, SJirubs, and Flowers. Flowers are divided into an- 
nuals, which flower and die the year they are sown ; bienni- 
als, which flower the second year, and then die ; and peren- 
nials, which do not gsnerally flower the first year, but die 
down to the ground annually and spring up again every suc- 
ceeding spring for a number of years. Prune apple, pear, 
peach, nectarine, and apricot trees. Plant peach, nectarine, 
apricot, apple, pear, plum, cherry, grape vines, strawberries, 
and raspberries. Sow china-asters, lupins, double larkspur, 
and geraniums. Set out carnations ; trim monthly roses. 



PARLOR AND DRAWING-ROOM. 

Let your parlor be attractive, by its air of comfort as well 
as neatness. Neatness is not always comfort. If some 
member of your family will leave his hat on the table, or sit 
on two chairs at a time, bear it patiently ; or if you have a 
sister or daughter who throws her work about carelessly, re- 
member that it is the general air of a room that gives it its 
character, and not a few articles out of place ; and keep your 
temper. A neat room is a good thing ; but a pleasant coun- 
tenance is better. Still, be careful that your parlor shall be 
fit for the introduction of accidental company. Never ask 
your acquaintance into a cold drawing-room. Depend upon 
it, their criticism of your character will be much less char- 
itable than if you are in some confusion by a warm fire. 
If you cannot afford two fires, it is better to say you are en- 
gaged, than to make your guests uncomfortable. When will 
it be considered the height of impoliteness, as it is unkind- 
ness, to ask visiters into a chilled room, though ever so

splendidly furnished ? What is there in the vapid intercourse 
of a call, to compensate for looking on a grate, \vith its clean 
fixtures, without a spark of fire. 



HERBS. 

By Mrs. Child. 

Herbs should be gathered while in blossom. If left till they have 
gone to seed, the strength goes into the seed. Those who have a 
little patch of ground, will do well to raise the most important herbs ; 
and those who have not, will do well to get them in quantities from 
some friend in the country ; for apothecaries make very great profits 
upon them. 

Sage is very useful both as a medicine for the headache, when 
made into tea — and for all kinds of stuffing, when dried and rubbed 
into powder. It should be kept tight from the air. 

Summer-savory is excellent to season soup, broth, and sausages. 
As a medicine, it relieves the cholic ; penny-royal and tansy are 
good for the same medicinal purpose. 

Green wormwood bruised is excellent for a fresh wound of any 
kind. In winter when wormwood is dry, it is necessary to soften it 
in warm vinegar or spirit before it is bruised, and applied to the 
wound. 

Hyssop tea is good for sudden colds, and disorders on the lungs. It 
is necessary to be very careful about exposure after taking it ; it is 
peculiarly opening to the pores. 

Tea made of colt's-foot and flax-seed, sweetened with honey, is a 
cure for inveterate coughs. Consumptions have been prevented by 
it. It should be drank when going to bed ; though it does good to 
drink it at any time. Hoarhound is useful in consvimptive com- 
plaints. 

Motherwort tea is very quieting to the nerves. Students, and peo- 
ple troubled with wakefulness, find it useful. 

Thoroughwort is excellent for dyspepsy, and every disorder occa- 
sioned by indigestion. If the stomach be foul, it operates like a 
gentle emetic. 



126 TPiE lady's annual register. 

Sweet-balm tea is cooling when one is in a feverish state. 

Catnip, particularly the blossoms, made into tea, is good to prevent 
a threatened fever. It produces a fine perspiration. It should be 
taken in bed, and the patient kept warm. 

The common dark blue violet makes a slimy tea, which is excel- 
lent for the canker. Leaves and blossoms are both good. Those 
who have families should take some pains to dry these flowers. 

When people have a sore mouth, from taking calomel, or any other 
cause, tea made of low blackberry leaves is extremely beneficial. 

Tea made of slippery-elm is good for the piles, and for humors in 
the blood. To be drank plentifully. Winter evergreen is considered 
good for all humors, particularly scrofula. Some call it rheumatism- 
weed ; because a tea made from it is supposed to check that painful 
disorder. 

A poultice made of common chickweed, that grows about one's 
door in the country, has given great relief to the toothache, when 
applied frequently to the cheek. 

Housekeepers should always dry leaves of the burdock and horse- 
radish. Burdocks warmed in vinegar, with the hard stalky parts cut 
out, are very soothing applied to the feet ; they produce a sweet and 
gentle persj iration. Horseradish is more powerful. It is excellent 
in cases of the ague, placed on the part affected. Warmed in vinegar 
and clapped. 

Succory is a very valuable herb. The tea sweetened with molas- 
ses is good for the piles. It is a gentle and healthy physic, — a pre- 
ventive of dyspepsy, humors, inflammation, and all the evils resulting 
from a restricted state of the system. 

Elder-blow tea has a similar efiect. It is cool and soothing ; and 
peculiarly eflicacious either for babes or grown people, w^hen the di- 
gestive powers are out of order. 

Lungwort, maiden-hair, hyssop, elecampane and hoar-hound steeped 
together is an almost certain cure for a cough. A wine-glass full to 
be taken when going to bed. 

Few people know how- to keep the flavor of sweet-marjoram ; the 
best of all herbs for broth, and stuffing. It should be gathered in 
bud, or blossom, and dried in a tin-kitchen at a moderate distance 
from the fire ; when dry it should be immediately corked in a bottle, 
and kept carefully from the air. 

An ointment of sw^eet lard, sulphur, and cream-of-tartar, simmered 
together, is excellent for the piles.

VISITING IN THE CITY. 

I live in the country, in a delightful situation, just far enough from 
town to make it a pleasant drive for invalids, and not too long a walk 
for persons fond of exercise. I was not much known in the fashion- 
able circle, until it was discovered that our house was in the vicinity 
of a delightful pond, on which we had a pleasure boat, and that we 
had an abundance of fruit and flowers in our garden. It was dis- 
covered also that Mrs. Fredland was extremely hospitable and that 
she always gave a ready welcome to her visiters, (friends, as they 
were called) with plenty of cake and ice-cream. 

It was the invariable practice, when these friends went away, for 
them to say to me, ' Now my dear Mrs. Fredland, you perceive that 
I come and see you without ceremony, and I wish you would return 
my visits in the sam.e way. Come any time when you have shopping 
in the city, and dine with me in a social manner, and bring your 
children. I hope you will not wait for a ceremonious invitation.' 

I am rather diffident, but still such kind of assurances, so often re- 
peated, had an influence, and I promised I would certainly avail 
myself of their friendly invitations. 

In the autumn, when our visiters had ceased to come into the 
country, and I supposed they were all comfortably established for the 
winter, I thought I would cultivate a sociable disposition, and go into 
the city and pass a day with some of my summer friends, as they 
had been so urgent ; and as my husband was called into town on 
business which would occupy him all day, I accompanied him. 

Mrs. Brown had been out in the strawberry season, with all her 
six children and nursery maid, and stayed a week ; and as it was early, 
I concluded to go first to her house, and leave my riding cloak ; and 
after making a few calls, return and dine with her. The fire was just 
kindling in the grate, and everything looked stifl' and cold. Mrs. 
Brown came down with a bonnet and shawl on — a practice which 
is sometimes adopted when a lady wishes to cut a visit short. 

'How do you do, my dear Mrs. Fredland? I am really delighted 
to see you. I am so sorry I cannot ask you to stay and spend the day 
socially. But I am just going out to buy my children's wi.-^iter clothes, 
and I have two women up stairs waiting for the materials. But yon

can come in any day, it is such a delightful drive, ayid ne shall be so glad 
to see youJ 

As I had many other friends to visit I was not much disturbed, but 
mere!)'- said I would not detain her, as she was going out. 

I had to walk half a mile before I could reach another friend. My 
cloak began to be very warm, and I was glad to find myself at Mrs. 
Clark's door. This lady had been very attentive to me all summer, 
and had been very kind in bringing out her friends and her children. 
She had urged me to come to town, and bring my children in return, 
and said they could play in the nursery with her little family, and it 
would be no trouble. Here I was sure of a cordial welcome. It was 
about twelve o'clock, and a fine sunny morning ; the exercise of 
walking, and my heavy cloak, made me very w^arm. The drawing- 
room door was thrown open by a stylish looking servant. I sent up 
my name, and he brought down word that Mrs. Clark was very sorry 
she could not see me, as she was particularly engaged, and hoped I 
would take an early opportunity to come in and pass a day socially. 
As the drawing-room looked as if visiters were expected, I could not 
resist asking the servant if Mrs. Clark did not see any company that 
day. ' Yes, ma'am, company to dine, but not morning calls.' 

I began to feel a little disheartened, but recollecting that I had very 
recently promised positively to spend one day socially with Mrs. Ca- 
pen, I resolved to direct my steps to her house. I had another half 
mile to walk, and my cloak became heavier and hotter every step I 
took. The streets were filled with ladies elegantly arrayed in shawls, 
and silks, and flowers, improving the fine weather to shew their new 
and fashionable dresses. I had a handsone shawl under my cloak; 
but alas ! at the present time it only added to my discomfort, by in- 
creasing the heat. 

I was rejoiced when I reached Mrs. Capen's door. My name was 
announced, and I w^as conducted into the drawing-room, which was 
absolutely filled with elegantly dressed ladies and gentlemen making 
morning calls. Mrs. Capen rose and received me in the most cordial 
manner. She begged me to take a seat by the fire, as she was sure 
I must be cold : — but I was almost melted. A large anthracite coal 
fire was glowing in the grate ; the bright sun was shining through 
the spacious windows ; and the embarrassment I felt at being sur- 
rounded with strangers, made my face the color of crimson. But 
there seemed but one vacant seat, and that was near the fire. Mrs. 



THE lady's annual REGISTER. 129 

Capen was very affable ; she inquired after the children, and after 
the poultry, and after the pigs ; she expatiated on the beauty and 
convenience of our country residence, and more particularly on its 
being such a delightful drive in summer. But she did not ask me 
to take off my cloak, or observe how uncomfortably I was situated. 
I have remarked that I was very diffident, and I had not courage to 
pass under the observation of her visiters a second time. I therefore 
kept my seat, although the perspiration stood in large drops on my 
face. She chatted with all the company in turn, and then turning 
suddenly to me, she said, 'Mrs. Fredland, when are you coming to 
pass a < social day ' with me ? You must not put it off till winter, 
but improve some fine day like this, and come without ceremony.' 
I saw that this remark was intended to cut off any hope I might have 
had of being invited to dine this day. A flush of anger added to the 
already crimson hue of my face, and at the same time gave me en- 
erg}' enough to retire. 

When I again found myself in the street I was perplexed whereto 
go, as my husband could not return home with me until evening. I 
walked along, almost forgetting in my discomfort the names and 
abodes of my friends. On looking across the street, I saw a lady 
with whom I thought I was very intimate. I knew she saw me, and 
I tried to catch her eye, but she avoided looking at me, and I saw by 
her determined manner, that she had made up her mind not to ask 
me home to dinner. 

The clock struck two, and found me still in the street ; but I had 
now become desperate ; and when I came to Mrs. Jones's house, I 
told her at once I had come to dine with her. At this intimation dis- 
may was depicted on her countenance, for she was one of those per- 
sons who would starve six days in the week for the sake of making 
a display on the seventh — and this was one of her starving days. 
She endeavored to conceal her embarrassment, and said she Mas de- 
lighted to see me, but if she had knorvn of my coming, if it were only 
a half an hour, she should have been prepared to see me. I told her 
not to trouble herself ; a comfortable seat and a piece of bread would 
be sufficient, for that I was almost worn out. But it was in vain for 
her to endeavor to appear easy. 

Her husband came in to dinner. 'What! Mrs. Fredland! My 
dear, you did not tell me you expected Mrs. Fredland to dine with 
us!' 



130 THE lady's annual REGISTER. 

' It is an unexpected pleasure,'' said Mrs. Jones, with a look of agony. 
'But you know we are never ceremonious with our friends.' 

Mrs. Jones had a decent family dinner, but she was so annoyed 
that I should find her unprepared, that she could hardly be hospitable 
to her forlorn guest. Mr. Jones was very easy and unconcerned, but 
he did not show much tact in getting his wife out of her trouble. 
' Now/ said Mr. Jones, ' I tell my wife not to worry so much about 
trifles. I tell her always to have enough, and then she need not fear 
the king. But she won't get over it for a week, because she did not 
know you were coming. My wife likes to show off her silver forks, 
and her French china, to appear as if she used them every day.' 

' I am sure, Mr. Jones, I am very happy to see Mrs. Fredland at 
any time, but it is one of m)^ peculiarities to like to know when I am 
to have company to dine.' 

' But, my dear,' said her husband, ' we cannot expect our friend 
from the country to stand on ceremony ; and if Mrs. Fredland likes 
a plain family dinner, (Mrs. J. gave a rueful glance at the table,) it 
will always give me very great satisfaction to have her drop in upon 
us just as we are sitting down to dine.' 

I did not think that Mrs. Jones intended to be uncivil, but she could 
not recover her equanimity, and she forgot how many times she had 
urged my coming ' without ceremony.' 

When I returned home to my cheerful family and well arranged 
household, I converted my troubles into amusement, by relating the 
experiences of the day to my husband and children. He was quite 
delighted with the account, because it confirmed his previous opin- 
ions about fashionable acquaintances. 

One day he came into the parlor, and told me he was going to the 
city to pass the day, and that if I would like to go in and see Mrs. 
Jackson, he did not think there would be an)^ danger of finding her 
either ' engaged ' or ' unprepared.' ' It is the only fashionable house 
in the city,' said he, ' where I would advise you to go Mithout a par- 
ticular invitation.' 

My reception by Mrs. Jackson was just such as I had anticipated; 
it was cordial and sincere. She said that she was glad I had come 
into town, for that the Binghams, whom she had brought out to dine 
with us last summer, were coming ; and she knew they would be ver}' 
glad to meet me. Here I felt on sure ground, and that I could in no 
way be an annoyance. Everything in this establishment was man- 



THE lady's annual REGISTER. 131 

aged on a liberal plan ; but if there was a fault, comfort was some- 
times sacrificed to elegance. Mr. Jackson's notions about his dinner 
arrangements were extremely precise. It isnot considered gejiteel to 
have more than twelve persons at a dinner party, and his table would 
of course admit no more without crowding — a thing not to be al- 
lowed. 

When we began to arrange ourselves round the table, he said in a 
whisper, but which I unfortunately overheard, ' Good heavens ! Mrs. 
Jackson, we have thirteen persons here ! How could you make such 
a mistake V The consciousness that I was the additional one sent 
the blood into my face, and I was covered with an overwhelming 
crimson blush. Did you ever blush so that you felt it at the crown 
of your head, and at the tips of your fingers ? Not a suffusion which 
soon passes away, but a deep, glowing, burning sensation, which 
brings the tears into your eyes ? Mrs. Jackson tried to make things 
easy, but in the moment she had for doing it, she could produce no 
impression on his disturbed mind. It was impossible for me to bear 
up under this mortification, particularly as I felt myself crushing the 
dresses of invited guests. I whispered to Mrs. Jackson, as I passed 
her, and said I was suddenly indisposed ; then I rushed up stairs for 
my bonnet and shawl, and hurried out of the house. 

These ladies all gave elegant balls in the winter, for which they 
sent me cards enveloped in a whole sheet of the finest letter paper. 
These invitations frequently came by mail, for which I had to pay 
doable, and sometimes treble postage. My husband would hand 
them to me, with one of his provoking smiles, and say — * We must 
not object to the postage on account of the honor of being remem- 
bered m the fashionable world.' As it was well known that we did 
not go into the city to evening parties, the attention was superfluous. 
With great respect, Jane Fredland.

ANECDOTES. 

'I say, Pat, what are you wTiting there, in such a large hand ? ' 
'Arrah, honey, an' i^ n't it to my poor mother, who is very deaf, that 
I 'm writing a loud letther ? ' 

'La, me, good old neighbor,' cried Mrs. Popps, ^what are you go- 
ing to do with that great ugly crow ? ' ' Why, you see we hear as 
how they live a hundred years j so husband and I got one to try.' 

A smart Yankee old lady, being called into court as a witness, 
grew impatient at the questions put to her, and told the judge that 
she would quit the stand, for he was ' raly one of the most inquisi- 
tive old gentlemen she ever see.' 

A lady being so unfortunate as to have her husband hang himself 
on an apple-tree, the wife of a neighbor immediately came to beg a 
branch of the tree for grafting ; ' for who knows,' said she, ' but it 
may bear the same kind of fruit ? ' 



SENSIBLE REMARKS. 

From the Young Lady's Friend. 

"When friends come to see you uninvited, do the best you can to 
entertain them well, but make no comment or apology ; for that al- 
ways sounds to your guests like a reproach for taking you unawares. 

Whatever economy it is right for you to practice, you should never 
be ashamed of. 

The greatest hospitality is generally found among persons of small 
incomes, who are contented to live according to their means, and 
who never give great dinners. 

It is better to keep clean than to make clean. 

Who that sees a young lady very carefully arranged at a ball, and 
finds her, when at home and not expecting company, in a torn or soiled 
dress, can fail to draw conclusions unfavorable to her character ? 

If the hearts of young people are right towards their parents, they 
will behave with proper respect and consideration towards their guests.

Still look to your cellar ; that is the housewife's winter 
garden. 

Trees, Shrubs, and Flowers. Preserve fruit trees against 
canker-worms by the following mixture, used as a substitute 
for tar. White varnish, soft soap and whale oil, one third 
of each, mixed and applied as tar is usually. This mixture 
is not soon hardened by the weather, and does not injure the 
trees. Another simple mode of preventing the ascent of 
the insects, is to wind a band of refuse flax, or swingle-tow, 
round the trunk of the tree, and stick on the band burdock 
or chestnut burs so thick that worms cannot pass between 
them. — The carnation (dianthus caryophyllus ) is a superb 
plant, and is biennial and perennial. There are various 
kinds, distinguished by names like those of the auricula, 
and what was said of the seed of that plant, applies to this. 
It is best propagated by layers. While it is in flower, it 
sends out several side shoots near the root. These are

pinned down in August a little under the earth, leaving the 
extreme part erect. In a little time they take root ; and the 
new plant must be severed from the old, and transplanted. 
The old plant does not always stand another winter ; there- 
fore its branches are thus used to continue the species. Car- 
nations are rather tender as to frost, and must be covered, as 
far north as Massachusetts, to live through the winter. It is 
best to put them in large pots, and to keep them in a green- 
house or parlor, or in some place where they can have air 
and light, during the winter. 



Soiit!)ern CKartren <a:alentrat:. 

Kitchen Garden. Sow peas, lettuces, radishes, mustard, 
cresses, rape and carrots. Plant cabbages, cauliflowers, on- 
ions, and oats. Hoe broccoli and spinage. Tie up endive. 
Protect celery from frost. Dress asparagus and artichokes. 

Trees, Shruhs, and Flowers. Prune peach trees, necta- 
rine, apricot, apple, pear, plum, cherry, and vines. Plant 
apple trees, pear, peach, nectarine, apricot, plumb, cherry, 
vines, &c. If you have a place large enough, let every 
young child in your family plant a tree or vine. — Duration 
of roots : Roots, with respect to duration, are, annual, bien- 
nial, or perennial. Annual roots are such as live but one 
year. They come from the seed in the spring, and die in 
autumn, including such as are raised from the seed every 
year ; as peas, beans, cucumbers, &c. Biennial roots are such 
as live two years. They do not produce any flowers the 
first season ; the next summer they blossom, the seeds ma- 
ture, and the roots die. The roots of cabbages are often, 
after the first season, preserved in cellars during the winter : 



THE lady's annual REGISTER. 135 

in the spring they are set out in gardens, and produce flow- 
ers ; the petals of which, in time, fall off, and the germ 
grows into a pod or silique, which contains the seed. The 
root, having performed this office, then dies, and no process 
can restore it to life ; the flowering is thought to exliaust the 
vital energy or living principle. The onion, beet, and car- 
rot, are biennial plants. Perennial roots are those whose 
existence is prolonged a number of years to an indefinite pe- 
riod ; as the asparagus, geranium, and rose ; also trees and 
shrubs. Climate and cultivation afiect the duration of the 
roots of vegetables. Many perennial plants become annual 
by transplanting them into cold climates ; the garden nastur- 
tion, originally a perennial shrub in South America, has be- 
come in our latitude an annual plant. 



TABLES FOR MEALS. 

A limited fortune is no excuse for deficiency in neatness. 
Every woman can wash her cups, and rub her silver, and 
lay her table-cloth even. Perhaps there are no articles so 
much slighted, or which so well repay a little care, as salt- 
cellars. Fine salt is nearly as cheap as coarse, quite as 
cheap for table purposes. It is a beautiful article. Pure as 
snow and sparkling as crystal, it makes the plainest vessel 
appear to advantage ; but dark, dingy, damp salt, if it be 
placed in ever so rich cut-glass, looks dismally, dolefully, 
dolorously dirty ! 

Now little Lucy, it is a rainy day, and as you are not go- 
ing to school, I should like to see if you can lay a table 
neatly. It is true we have no silver forks, nor venison 
blazes, nor cut-glass finger-bowls, nor damask napkins, 



136 



THE LADY S ANNUAL REGISTER. 



nor champagne glasses. But you can make our common 
plates feel smooth to the touch ; the plain tumblers can be 
transparent ; and the knives and forks, by rubbing, look pol- 
ished. Look to the butter, especially. See the difference 
between that smooth mass, nicely stamped, which Aunt Je^ 
mima has just sent in on a plate carefully wiped at the 
edges, and this daubed and oily-looking butter bowl, with a 
knife inserted in the midst. Lucy, let me beg you to keep 
a jar of pure water and a wooden butter-stick ready, that you 
may arrange the butter for meals on perfectly clean plates or 
butter-bowls. Look to the sugar-bowl ; it requires emptying 
and washing, within as well as outside. A piece of bread 
and butter, with a well-set table, is better than many dishes 
amid dirt and disorder. 



EXPENSES OF DRE SS 
UNDER ORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES. 

A lady lately asked some friends what would be the prob- 
able expense of dress per year for a young lady and gentle- 
man, in good society, without pretensions to extravagance. 
Some of them answered a hundred dollars each ; some a 
hundred and fifty ; some two hundred. One said twenty- 
five dollars for a young lady, and a hundred for a gentle- 
man ; another said eighty for a gentleman, and a hundred 
and twenty-five for a lady. Another lady and gentleman 
drew up the following estimate. It may be interesting to 
compare these with one's experience and observation, al- 
though it is probable no two persons would exactly agree.

RECIPES FOR COOKING. 



Potatoes. We every day hear complaints about watery potatoes. 
Put into the pot a piece of lime as large as a hen's e^g ; and how 
watery soever the potatoes may have been, when the water is poured 
off, the potatoes will be perfectly dry and mealy. Some persons use 
salt — which only hardens potatoes. 

Wine made of parsnep root approaches nearer to the Malmsey of 
Madeira and the Canaries than any other. 

Puff Paste. To a pound and a quarter of sifted flour, rub gently 
in with the hand half a pound of fresh butter ; mix up with half a 
pint of spring water ; knead it well, and set it by for a quarter of an 



138 THE lady's annual register. 

hour ; then roll it oiit thin ; lay on it, in small pieces, three quarters 
of a pound more of butter ; throw on it a little flour ; double it up in 
folds and roll it out thin three times, and set it by for about an hour 
in a cold place ; roll it of moderate thickness, put on pattepans to 
bake, with such fruit as you have ; lay pieces across the top, of any 
shape as suits your fancy. In small pans fill up with preserves 
after they are done ; bake of a light brown. 

Cottage Fotatoe Pudding. Parboil and mash two pounds of pota- 
toes ; beat them up into a smooth batter, with about three quarters of 
a pint of milk, two ounces of moist sugar, and three beaten eggs. 
Bake it about three-quarters of an hour. Three ounces of currants 
or raisins may be added. Leave out the milk, and add three ounces 
of butter. Bake in pattepans, with tart paste at the bottom, or add 
a little flour, and it will make a nice cake. 

Batter Pudding. Common flour pudding, or batter pudding, is 
easily made. Those who live in the country can beat up five or six 
eggs with a quart of milk, a little salt, with flour enough to make it 
just thick enough to pour without difficulty. Those who live in the 
city, and are obliged to buy eggs, can do with three eggs to a quart, 
and more flour in proportion. Boil about three quarters of an hour. 

Nottingham Pudding. Peel six good apples — take out the core 
with the point of a small knife, or an apple-corer if you have one — 
but be sure to leave the apples whole ; fill up with sugar ; place 
them in a pie-dish, and pour over them a nice light batter, prepared 
as for batter pudding ; and bake an hour in a moderate oven. 

Bread Pudding. Make a pint of bread crumbs ; put them in a 
stew-pan, with as much milk as will cover them — the peel of a 
lemon, a little grated nutmeg, and a small piece of cinnamon ; boil 
about ten minutes ; sweeten with brown or powdered loaf sugar ; 
take out the cinnamon, and put in four eggs ; beat all well together ; 
and bake half an hour, or boil rather more than an hour.
