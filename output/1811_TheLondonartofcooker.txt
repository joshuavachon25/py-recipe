PREFACE. 



V^OOKERY, like every other Art, has been moving 
forward to Perfection by slow Degrees; and yet 
daily Improvements are still making, as must be the 
Case in every Art depending on Fancy and Taste. 
From the many Books of this Kind already pub- 
lished, it could hardly be supposed there would be 
occasion for another, yet we flatter ourselves, that 
the Readers of this Work will find, from a candid 
Perusal, and an impartial Comparison, that our 
Pretensions to the Favours of the Public are not ill 
founded. 

The Generality of Books on Cookery are grouped 
together, without Method or Order, and therefore 
rendered intricate and bewildering; even the Re- 
ceipts are written with so much Carelessness and 
Inaccuracy, that they are not only perplexing, but 
frequently unintelligible. In this Work, however, 



PREFACE. 

we hope, that Perspicuity and Regularity will be 
seen in every step we have taken. We have divided 
the whole Book into separate Parts, and those Parts 
into Chapters; so that our Readers have only to look 
into the Contents, and they will there find at one 
view, the whole of that Branch of Cookery they may 
want to consult. The Utility of regularly classing 
every Thing in a Book of this Kind is too obvious to 
need Arguments lo support it. 

The greatest Care and Precaution have boon 
taken to admit nothing inelegant, or prejudicial to 
the Constitution, in any of the Receipts ; and we 
have not only given, in the Appendix, a distinct 
Section on Culinary Poisons, but have also in dif- 
ferent Parts of the Work reminded the Cooks of 
the fatal Consequences of not keeping their Coppers 
and Saucepans properly clean and tinned, 

As Farley's Cookery is intended for the Use of 
all Ranks in general, not only for those who have 
attained a tolerable Knowledge of Cookery, but 
also for others less experienced, .we have occasion- 
filly given the most simple with the most sumptuous 
dishes, and thereby afforded the means of decorating 
the Table of the Peer, or the M&hauic. 

The various Branches of Pastry and Confection- 
ary, comprising Pies, Puddings, Cakes, Custards, 



PREFACE. VII 

Jams, Creams, Jellies, Preserves, Conserves, Ices, 
and all the other numerous and elegant Articles of 
that Class ; as well as the Preparation of Pickles, 
the Art of making Wines, Liqueurs, and Cordials, 
are treated under distinct Heads, and rendered 
plain, easy, and familiar, to every Capacity. We 
shall only add, that neither Labour, Care, nor Ex- 
pense have been spared to make this Work worthy 
of the Patronage of the Public.

THE 



LONDON ART OF COOKERY. 



INTRODUCTION. 

AN a publication like the present, it would be of 
little utility to trace the origin of cookery; nor would 
it be easy to say at what period man exchanged 
vegetable for animal diet : certain it is, that he no 
sooner began to feed on. flesh, fowl, and fish, than 
seasonings of some kind became requisite, not only 
to render such food more pleasing and palatable, 
but also to help digestion and prevent putrefaction. 
Of these seasonings, salt was probably the first dis- 
covered; though some are inclined to think, that 
savory roots and herbs were previously used. Spices, 
however, such as ginger, cinnamon, pepper, cloves, 
and nutmegs, by degrees came into practice, and 
the whole art of cookery gradually improved, till it 
reached its present perfection. 

Boiling, or stewing, seems to have been the first 
mode of, dressing; toasting, or broiling, succeeded 
next; and beyond these, no improvements were 
made in the art of cookery for several centuries. 
The introduction of trade and commerce into Eu- 
rope, soon made us acquainted with the products of 
other countries; and rich fruits and spices, im- 

B 



11 INTRODUCTION. 

ported from the most remote regions of the globe 
were soon sought after with avidity. Cookery, in- 
cluding pickling, and the various branches of con- 
fectionary, soon became an art, and was as methodi- 
cally studied as the more polite sciences. A regular 
apprenticeship is now served to it; and the profes- 
sors of it are incorporated by charter, as forming 
one of the livery companies of London. Since then 
Cookery must be considered as an art, we shall pro- 
ceed to treat of its different branches in regular 
order ; but preface our directions, by some useful 
hints on domestic economy. 



1 o every mistress of a family, we cannot too strenuously 
Recommend the superintendence of her domestic concerns, the 
investigation oP all accounts, particularly those of her trades- 
men and her servants; and the most strict scrutiny into the 
characters of those she may admit as inmates of her house. 
Amongst the minor duties inseparable from her situation, are, 
the attention to her storeroom, and linen of every description. 
In the former, should be a selection of the most unperish^ 
able stores, of which description are groceries, candles, soap, 
starch, &c. ; and of the latter, no more should be delivered to 
the housekeeper, than are absolutely requisite for constant 
use ; and of these a correct inventory made, as a check upon 
the housekeeper, who will thereby be compelled to account 
for every deficiency. 

The Housekeeper* 

SHOULD take her orders for the day, early in the morning \ 
by which means all the under-servants will have sufficient 
time to perform their several duties, without either hurry or 
neglect : it is also her indispensable duty, not only to see 
that all the female servants perform their work in the most 
perfect manner ; but that, in the discharge of it, they do not 
waste any thing. As all the linen in constant use is com- 
mitted to her charge, she should see that it is neatly mended 
if torn ; and should take care that it is not heedlessly torn or 
unnecessarily soiled : and before any more is given out, that 
the different articles already used, have been pat in their 
proper places. As under-servants are ever too ready to con- 
sider coarse cloths, such a.s duste.s, &,c. of little value; no 
more should be given them, unless they produce the remains 
of the old ones, and sufficiently account for their being worn 
out. As she will have the care of the stores for immediate 
consumption, she should be sparing in the distribution of 

B 2 



4 MINTS ON DOMESTIC ECONOMY. 

them ; particularly groceries, soap, and candles : the former 
are too often demanded for the purpose of entertaining 
friends; and the latter, frequently for a worse purpose. She 
should daily register the notes of the butcher, baker, fish- 
monger, and ot ers ; and see that the articles specified in 
those notes, are actually of the implied weight and quality. 
As the housekeeper has more confidence placed in her than 
any other servant, of course her responsibility is greater ; and 
she cannot do better than consider herself as the faithful 
steward of her master. Her bill of fare should contain a suf- 
ficient variety ; and the different articles selected snould, when 
dressed, be so placed upon the table, as to accord with each 
other, thereby forming a picture, that, by pleasing the eye, 
may excite an appetite. 

The Cook 

WILL be immediately under the inspection of the house- 
keeper ; but it is her province to dress the meat according to 
the modern costume, and afterwards to dish it up in an ele- 
gant manner. The larder must be particularly attended to, 
for on its neatness, the keeping of the meat, poultry, &c. will 
very much depend. The dressers, shelves, &c. must be well 
scoured, and the floor washed with plenty of cold water, and 
thoroughly mopped dry : for want of this precaution, musti- 
ness is produced. All butcher's meat should be sent in before 
sun-rise ; but as it is almost impossible to prevent flies from 
blowing it, the whole should be carefully looked over, and 
wiped clean and dry. All meat intended to be eaten cold, 
shouloVbe rather over-done in summer ; for the gravy makes 
it spoil : roasted meat must be sprinkled with salt before taken 
from the fire. Cold meat of every kind, should be changed 
morning and evening into clean and dry dishes. Stews, 
sauces, and soups, should be boiled every second day at least 
in summer, to prevent fermentation. Lardings returned 
whole to the kitchen, should be covered with the sheets of 
bacon that covered them before they were taken out of the 
braise; and then put again into the same braise. Tenderones 
of lamb and veal, ox rumps, beef or veal olives, roulards of 
mutton or veal, rump of beef, and every other thing done in 
braises, should be carefully attended to ; as they may be re- 
peatedly served at table, with the same elegance as at first. 
Remember never to overstock the larder. For the care of 
different joints, poultry, c. See Marketing. 

Very much will depend upon the care and economy of the 
cook : by good management, she may be the means of saving 
a large sum in the article of coals, bv carefully reserving the 
cinders for the laundry. As much very valuable china is an- 



HINTS ON DOMESTIC ECONOMY. 5 

nually broken, for want of a little care; she will do well to 
change ail the best dishes for common ones, as soon as the 
dinner is sent from the dining-room. Respecting her culi- 
n.i rv vessel, i hey should be je\er kept with the greatest clean- 
liness ; and fresh tinned whenever they may want it. Tin 
meat-covers are soon spoiled if not wiped dry after being 
u.>eJ, and they may be restored to their Conner polish without 
injurv, bv usi;tg the following preparation : take fine whiting, 
ba-elv moistened with olive oil ; with this and a piece of soft 
leather rub the covers; wipe clean with a soft linen, and 
lastly, sprinkle over them some dr} T whiting in fine po\vder, 
and polish with leather. 

The Housemaid 

WILL also be particularly under the inspection of the house- 
keeper; but still a great deal will depend upon her own 
cleanliness and exertions : the beds not in use should be 
every day aired by shaking t^em, and the blankets nicely 
folded and placed between the bed and mattress: the curtains 
and hangings should be slightly srmken and dusted with a 
proper brush, and replaced in their former order. Before 
sweeping the rooms, t l >ey should be sprinkled with tea-leaves, 
and the carpets swept with a proper whisk-brush. In towns, 
carpets are very liable to be soiled by smoke, dust, &c. in 
which case, the following application, published by the Society 
for the encouragement of Arts, c. will be invariably found 
to remove the dirt, c. For every gallon of w.,ter intended 
to be used, take eight raw potatoes, grate them into fine 
pulp, mix them with the water, and wash the carpet slightly 
with a large spunge : this mixture will not only clean, but 
restore the colour of carpets to their former beauty. 

For removing grease-spots on the boards Apply a few drops 
of oil of turpentine, rubbing it in with the finger: this will 
dissolve the grease, and make it mix with the soap when 
washed. 

For preventing steel and iron from rusting. Take mutton 
suet, melt and strain it; warm the steel, or iron; nib it with 
the melted suet, and sprinkle finely powdered hot lime over 
it: or take two pounds of unsalted hogslard, melt it, and whilst 
warm, add as much black lead as will thicken it; rub this over 
the iron or steel. 

For taking: rust out of polished grates, fenders, &V. Apply 
olive oil, letting it remain on the spot for forty-eight hours : 
powder some hot or unslackecl lime, sprinkle it over the place, 
and rub till the rust disappear. 

For taking the black or burnt parts out of polished steel bar*. 
Boil in two- quarts of water, one pound of soft soap, till re- 



6 HINTS ON DOMESTIC ECONOMY. 

duced to one quart: this when cold will form a jelly; of 
which take three spoonsful, and mix to the thickness of paste 
by adding powdered rmery : rub the bars with some of this 
mixture put on a piece of clean cloth, and polish with glasi 
paper. 

For blacking stoves. -Take blacklead one pound, table 
beer one pint, soft soap about the size of a wa! iut ; boil till 
the soap is dissolved : with this mixture brush over the stove, 
and when dry, polish with a common stove brush. Or take 
blacklead one pound, water a pint and a half, common gum 
one ounce: boil till the gum is dissolved, and apply it as in 
the former c.ise. 

For blacking stone chimney-pieces. Grind together oil var- 
nish and lamp black, add spirits of turpentine, till reduced to 
the thickness of paint. Having previously well cleaned the 
stone, and dried it, apply a coat of this varnish with a fine 
brush, and when quite dry a second coat. This varnish is 
usually sold under the name of Brunswick blacking. 

For taking iron-moulds cut of marble. Drop a verv small 
quantity of weak oil of vitriol on the spots, rub with a linen 
rag, and they will disappt-ar: but observe immediately to 
wash the part with soap and water. As marble will in time 
become yellow, the following preparation will both- remove 
it and also fresh polish it: mix unslacked lime with strong 
soap-ley, as thick as batter; lay it on with a brush, and in 
two months time wash it off with a strong lather of soap and 
water: the polish may be heightened by well rubbing with a 
plean hard brush. 

The Laundiymaid 

SHOULD always use the cinders reserved for her use by the 
cook, as they will answer equally well with coals; arid when 
burnt either in the ironing stove or under the copper, will 
give an intense heat. She will find that by soaking the 
clothes over night in soft water, that they will wash much 
more easily ; especially if the parts most soiled be slightly 
rubbed with soap. The best laundresses use a ley made by 
pouring water upon wood-ashes, and straining through an 
hair-cloth this ley not only saves soap, but gives a beautiful 
whiteness to the linen. In washing flannels, be careful never 
to pour boiling water upon them, as it will thicken them ; 
but take the flannels, and put them in scalding water, which 
will keep them thin. Ink-stains, fruit-stains, and iron-mould, 
are easily removed by using the essential salt of lemons. 
Spirit ot salt may be also used for the same purpose ; but if 
the part -is not immediately washed with soap and water, the 
texture of the linen may be hurt by it. In getting up fine- 



HINTS ON DOMESTIC ECONOMY. 7 

things, the clear-starchers use gum-water ; but as gum-arabic 
is very dear, its use should be confined to the finest articles. 

The Butler 

HAS, in most situations, nearly as great responsibility as the 
housekeeper; of course, like her, he has the superintendence 
of the footmen, and he should be particularly careful that 
the table, sideboard, &c. are well cleaned and rubbed ; that 
the glasses and plate are brilliant and unsullied ; and that 
both the disposition of the table and sideboard are neat and 
elegant. For cleaning plate, there is not any thing equal to 
rouge, the substance used for that purpose by the silversmiths 
and their polishers : it may be had at Fenn's, in Newgate 
Street ; and at Knight's, in Forster Lane. In using it, a very 
small quantity may either be wetted with water, and slightly 
rubbed over the plate with a soft spunge, and afterwards po- 
lished with soft leather : or it may be mixed with olive oil, 
and use the leather. The cellar should be ever kept with 
the greatest neatness ; and it will be highly creditable to the 
butler, if a regular cellar-book is kept; ty means of which, 
his master will easily perceive the faithful disposal of every 
bottle consumed. See Wines and Beer. 

The Footman 

WILL be under the control of the butler, and it will be 
greatly to his credit if every thing be kept in the neatest 
and best order. The decanters are apt to become furred, in 
which case they may be effectually cleansed and restored to 
their brilliancy, by scraping a raw potatoe into a pint of water : 
with this, rinse them, aad wash it out with clean water. An 
highly polished table and sideboard should be the foatman's 
pride : to obtain which, the Speenhausan receipt will very 
much contribute: take cold-drawn linsed oil, two quarts; 
alkanet-root bruised, two ounces; rose-pink, one ounce : put 
them together into a bottle, let them stand for a fortnight, 
shaking the bottle three or four times a day. To use this 
oil, the table must be first washed with warm vinegar, and 
when dry, the oil rubbed on with a linen cloth ; in this state 
it should remain at least six hours, when it may be wiped off 
.with linen, and then polished with a linen cloth. Observe, 
you must never use a woollen cloth. At every other clean- 
ing, it will be sufficient to use the oily cloth, and polish with 
a dry one. Tables rubbed with oil, acquire in time a polish 
unattainable by any other means: the common tables at 
Speen Hill ?.re a proof of this. But as this oil requires .a 
constant and continued use, it may not perhaps, on the whole, 
be as well liked as the following: take four ounces of bees- 
wax, and half an ounce of white rosin, melt them in one ounce 
.of olive oil, adding rose-pink to make it of' a beautiful colour; 



8 MINTS ON DOMESTIC ECONOMY. 

to this composition add as much spirit of turpentine as will 
make it of the thickness of honey. Rub it on the table with 
a piece of linen cloth, and polish \\ith a clean cloth. The 
turpentine will fly off, consequently a little more must be 
added, as it grows too tliick. Nothing will more effectually 
clean coats, &c. after they have been first beaten and brushed, 
than by sprinkling them with a little dry sand, and brushing 
it o.'Y with the grain of the cloth. Grease spots may be re- 
moved by scraping upon them a little French chalk, rubbing 
it in well with the finger, and afterwards brushing it off: or 
by dropping a few drops of spirit of turpentine upon it, and 
rubbing it in well. The best blacking for shoes, r -itdc by 
dissolving the improved blacking-cake in water, wh cii i. ^old 
by Bailey, in Cockspur Street. And the following is an inva- 
luable recipe for cleaning boot -tops : take half an ounce of 
oil of vitriol, two ounces of water, and nvx i ; ndi.;>iiy ;n a 
strong earthen pot ; (if not mixed gradually w ith the '. ater, 
it will heat too much and crack the p^t). With uiis liquid 
wash the boot-tops, and wipe them dry. Huve ready the 
white of one egg weli beaten in tlie juice of a lemon, and 
when well mixed, add half a pint of mi!k. With this mix'ure, 
wash over the boot-tops : when dry, wash then. ith n,nk and 
water, wipe them quite dry, and brush them with a ciean hard 
brush. 

The Coachman 

GFNERALLY is entrusted by his master to purchase the hay, 
oats, beans, and straw : in the choice of all these he cannot be 
too particular, as his horses cannot thrive upon bad coin or 
hay, nor will straw of a bad quality last nearly as long as good. 
In case of the illness of his horses, he should not consult 
every ignorant farrier, nor undertake the cure of them him. 
self. It will be less expense to take the advice of a veteri- 
nary surgeon. The varnish of carriages becomes, after a little 
use, rather dull, even by the best care : in this case it may be 
much heightened by using a little fine tripoli, moistened wilh 
olive oil, and put upon soft leather : with this let the carriage 
be rubbed and then wiped off, and polish off with olive oil 
and a clean leather. The harness should be oiled in the in- 
side, and blacked on the outside : by this means it will always 
look well, and never crack: the plate maybe cleaned with;* 
fine whiting. 

The Groom 

MAY always easily clean his stirrups, bits, &c. by rubbing 
them over-night with olive oil, and by sprinkling hot lime on 
them in the morning : rub this off with a soft leather. The 
saddle may be cleaned by the composition nlready directed 
for boot-tops.

DIRECTIONS FOR THE PROPER CHOICE OF DIFFERENT 
KINDS OF PROVISIONS. 



IN the choice of ox-beef, observe, that, if the meat is 
young, it will have a fine smooth open grain, of a pleasing 
carnation reel, and feel tender ; the fat must be rather white 
than yellow ; for when it is quite yellow, the meat is seldom 
good ; the suet must be perfectly white. The grain of cow- 
beef is closer, the fat whiter than that of ox-beef, but the 
lean has not so bright a red. The grain of bull-beef is still 
closer, the fat hard and skinny, the lean of a deep red, and 
has a stronger smell than either cow or ox-beef.

salt; take out the pipe running along the chine-bone, and 
rub the place and the bone with salt ; take out the kernel at

the thick end, fill the hole with salt ; and take out the pith, 
and rub the place with salt. 

Rump. Take out the kernel left in the fat, filling the hole 
with salt ; and sprinkle salt slightly over the whole. 

Ribs. Cutoff the piece of skirt; nub the chine-bone, the 
inside of the ribs, and the tops of the ribs with salt. The 
above, should be all hung up. 

Hound or buttock. Take out the kernel called the Pope's 
eye, and the other in thick fat. Without this precaution, no 
quantity of salt-will preserve it in summer. 

Thick-flank. Take out the kernel in the middle of the fat. 

Edge or aitch-bone. Take out the- kernel where the rump 
is cut off. 

Brisket. Joint the bones, to let in the salt. 

Mutton. 

IF you squeeze young mutton with your fingers, it will feel 
very tender; but if it be old, it will feel hard and continue 
wrinkled, and the fat will be fibrous and clammy. The grain 
of ram mutton is close, the flesh is of a deep red, and the fat 
is spongy and yellow. The flesh of ewe mutton is paler than 
that of the wether, and the grain is closer. Most people give 
the preference to short-shanked mutton.

CARE OF THE DIFFERENT JOINTS. 

Leg. Take out the kernel from the fat of the upper part ; 
fill ttie hole with salt, and sprinkle salt slightly over the whole 
in summer. 

Shoulder. Rub the inside well with salt. 

Chine. Take out the kernel near the tail, rub the place

with salt; take out the kidney-fat quite clean, cut the pipe 
running along the back-bone, and rub the inside with salt. 

Neck. Wipe quite dry with a cloth; trim the scrag; 
sprinkle the chine-bone and the inside of the ribs with salt. 

Breast. Cut out the skirt, and sprinkle both sides with 
salt. These joints are all to be hung, and these directions are 
chiefly applicable to summer. 

Lamb. 

THE head of a lamb is good, if the eyes are bright and 
plump; but if they are sunk and wrinkled, it is stale. If the 
vein in the neck of the fore-quarter appear of a fine blue, it 
is fresh ; but if it be green or yellow, you may be sure it is 
stale. In the hind quarter, if there be a faint disagreeable 
smell near the kidney, or if the knuckle is very limber, it is 
not good. 

Lamb is generally cut in quarters if divided into joints, 
observe the same rules as those for mutton. 

Veal. 

THE Mesh of a co\v-calf is whiter than that of a bull, but 
the flesh is not so firm ; the fillet of the former is generally 
preferred, on account of the udder; if the head is fresh, the 
eyes will be plump; but if stale, they will be sunk and wrink- 
led. If the vein in the shoulder is not of a bright red, the meat 
is not fresh : and if there are any green or yellow spots in it, it 
is very bad. A good neck an:J breast will be white and dry; 
but if they are clammy, and look green or yellow at the upper 
end, they are stale. The kidney is the soonest apt to taint in 
the loin, and if it is stale, it will be soft and slimy. .A leg is 
good if it be firm and white ; but bad if it is limber, and the 
flesh flabby, with green or yellow spots.

CARE OF THE DIFFERENT JOINTS. 

Leg. Wipe the udder perfectly drv : take out the skewer 
which fastens down the udder, a- d rub t.Mj hole with s<ilt ; 
and take out the kernel from the tincl; fat. 

Loin. Cut out the pipe running along the chine-bone ; 
wipe dry with a do'h; examine the kidney of tiie loose side, 
wipe dry; and having taken out the kernel in the inside of 
the chump, sprinkle the whole over slightlv with salt. 

Neck. Cut out the pipe running along the chine-bo n e ; 
wipe the chine and the inside of the ribs very dry. and slightly 
sprinkle with salt. 

Breast. Cut off the skirt on the inside, rub dry, and 
sprinkle with salt. 

Pork. 

MEASLY pork is very dangerous to eat ; but this state of it 
is eas-iy discovered, by the tat being full of little kernels. If 
it is young the lean will break on beiug pinched, and the skin 
will dent, by nipping it with the fingers: the fat, like lard, 
will be soft and pulpy. If the rind is thick, rough, and can- 
not be nipped with the fingers, it is old. It the flesh is cool 
and smooth, it is fresh ; but if it is clammy, it is tainted ; and, 
in this case, the knuckle part will always be the worst. Ob- 
serve, a thin rind is always best. 




THE JOINTS IN A PIG ARE :

Pork intended for roasting, should be always previously 
sprinkled with salt, as it eats with much more relish.

and smell well, it is good ; but if it is danbed and smeared, 
and has a disagreeable smell, be sure not to buy it. 

Bacon. 

IF bacon is good, the fat will feel oilv, and look white, and 
the lean will be of a good colour; and SUCK close to the bone ; 
but it is, or will be rusty very soon, if ri ere are anv yeilow 
streaks in the lean. The rind of y oung bacon is Always thin j 
but thick, if old. 

Brawn. 

THE rind of old brawn is thick and hard ; but young, if 
moderate. 7'he rind and fat of barrow and sow brawn are 
very tender. 

Venison. 

THE fat of venison must, in a great measure, determine 
your choice of it. If the fat is thick, bright, and dear, the 
clefts smooth and close, it is young ; but a very wide tough 
cleft, shows it is old. Venison will first change at the 
haunches and shoulders : run in a knife, and you will judge 
of its newness or staleness, by its sweet or rank smell. If it is 
tainted, it will look greenish or inclining to be very black. 



THE JOINTS IN A DEER ARE : 



Haunch 
Neck - 
Shoulder 
Breast - 




Rub the different joints till perfectly dry; wipe over with 
a fresh dry cloth ; and sprinkle over the whole, a composition 
of three parts of pepper and one of salt. Observe to take 
the kernel out of the haunch, as already directed for mutton. 

Turkeys. 

IF acock turkey is young-, it will have a smooth black leg, 
with a short spur; the eyes will be full and bright, and the 
feet limber and moist ; but you must carefully observe, that the 
spurs are not cut or scraped to deceive you. When a turkey 
is stale, the feet are dry and the eyes sunk. The same rule 



14 MARKETING. 

will determine whether a hen-turkey be fresh or stale, young 
or old; with this difference, that if old, her legs will be rough 
and red ; if with egg, the vent will be soft and open ; but if 
she have no eggs, the vent will be hard. 

Cocks and Hens. 

THE spurs of a young cock are short ; -but the same pre- 
caution will be as necessary here, in that point, as just ob- 
served in Ihe choice of turkeys. Their vents will be open, if 
stale ; but close and hard, if fresh. Hens are always best 
when full of eggs, and just before they begin to lay. The 
combs and legs of an old hen are rough ; but smooth when 
young. The comb of a good capon is very pale, its breast is 
peculiarly fat, and it has a thick belly, and a large rump. 

Geese. ' 

A YELLOW bill and feet, with but few hairs upon them, are 
the mark of a young goose, but these are red when old. The 
feet will be limber, if fresh, but stiff and dry if old. Green 
geese are in season from May or June, till they are three 
months old. A stubble goose will be good till five or six 
months old, and should be picked dry; but green geese 
should be scalded. The same rules will hold good for wild 
geese, with respect to their being young or old. 

Ducks. 

THE legs of a fresh-killed duck are limber ; and if it is fat, 
its belly wiil be hard and thick. The feet of a stale duck are 
dry and stiff. The feet of a tame duck are inclining to a 
duSlcy yellow, and are thick. The feet of a wild duck are 
smaller than a tame one, and are of a reddish colour. Ducks 
must be picked dry ; but ducklings should be scalded. 

Pheasants. 

THESE very beautiful birds are of the English cock and. 
hen kind, and are of a fine flavour. The cock has spurs, 
which the hen has not, and the hen is most valued when with 
egg. The spurs of a young cock pheasant are short and 
blunt, or round ; but if old, they are long and sharp. If the 
vent of the hen be open and green, she is stale ; and when 
rubbed hard with the finger, the skin will peel : if with egg, 
the vent will be soft. 

Woodcocks. 

A WOODCOCK is a bird of passage, and is found with us only 
in the winter. They are best about a fortnight or three week 



MARKETING. 15 

after their first appearance, when they have rested after their 
Jong passage over the ocean. If fat, they will feel firm and 
thick, which is a proof of their good condition. Their vent 
will be also thick and hard, and a vein of fat will run by the 
side of the breast ; but a lean one will feel thin in the vent. 
If newly killed, its feet will be limber, and the head and 
throat clean ; but the contrary, if stale. 

Partridges. 

AUTUMN is the season for partridges, when, if young, the 
legs will be yellowish, and the bill of a dark colour. If they 
are fresh, the vent will be firm ; but if stale, it will look green- 
ish, and the skin will peel when rubbed with the finger. If 
old, the bill will be. white, and the legs blue. 

Bustards. 

THE same rules given for the choice of the turkey, will 
hold good with respect to this curious bird. 

Pigeons. 

THESE birds are full and fat at the vent, and limber-footed, 
when new ; but if the toes are harsh, the vent loose, open, 
and green, they are stale. If old, their legs will be large and 
red. The tame pigeon is preferable to the wild, and should 
be large in the body, fat and tender ; but the wild pigeon is 
not so fat. Wood pigeons are larger than wild pigeons, but 
in other respects like them. The same rules will hold good 
in the choice of the plover, fieldfare, thrush, lark, black- 
bird, &c. 

Hares. 

BOTH the age and freshness of a hare are to be considered 
in the choice of it. When old, the claws are blunt and rug- 
ged, the ears dry and tough, and the cleft wide and large; 
but on the contrary, if the claws are smooth and sharp, the 
ears tear easily, and the cleft in the lip is not much spread, it 
is young. The body will be stiff, and the flesh pale, if newly 
killed ; but if the flesh is turning black, and the body limber, 
it is stale; though hares are not always considered as the worse 
for being kept till they smell a little. The principal distinc- 
tion between a hare and a leveret, is, that the leveret should 
have a knob, or small bone, near the foot, on its foreleg, which 
a hare has not. 

Rabbits. 

THE claws of an old rabbit are very rough and long, and 
grey hairs are intermixed with the wool ; but the wool and 



16 MARKETING. 

claws are smooth, when young. If stale, it will be limber, and 
the flesh will look bluish, with a kinJ of slime upon it; but it 
will be stiff, and the flesh white and dry, if fresh. 

fish. 

THE general rules for discovering whether fish a; ';esh or 
stale, are by observing the colour of their gills, whic hould 
be of a lively red ; whether they are hard or easy to be open- 
ed, the standing out or sinking in of their eyes, the r ^ ns 
being st'ff or limber, or by smelling to their gills F sii taken 
in running water are always better than those taken from 
ponds. 

Turbot. 

IF a turbot is g "od, it will be thick and plump, and the 
belly of a yellowish white; but they are not good, if they 
appear thin and bluish. Turbot are in season the greater 
part of the summer, and are generally caught in the German 
and British Ocean. 

Soles. 

GOOD soles are thick and firm, and the belly of a fine 
cream-colour ; but they are not good, if they are flabby, 
or incline to a bluish white. Midsummer is their principal 
season. 

Lobsters. 

IF^ lobster is fresh, the tail will be stiff', and pull up with 
a spring; but if stale, the tail will be flabby, and have no 
spring in it. This rule, however, concerns- lobsters that are 
boiled ; and it is much better to buy them alive, and boil 
them yourself, taking cave that they are not spent by too long 
keeping. If they have not been long taken, the claws will 
have a quick and strong motion upon squeezing the eyes, 
and the heaviest are esteemed the best. '\ he cock-lobster is 
known by the narrow back part of his tail. The two upper- 
most fins within his tail arestiflFand hard ; but those of the 
hen are soft, and the tail broader. The male, though gene- 
rally smaller than the female, has the higher flavour, the flesh 
firmer, and the body of a redder colour, when boiled. 

Sturgeon. 

THE flesh of a good sturgeon is very white, with a few 
blue veins, the grain even, the skin tender, good-coloured, 
and soft. All the veins and gristles should be blue ; for when 
these are brown or yellow, the skin harsh, tough, and dry, the

fish is bad. It has a pleasant smell when good, but a very 
disagreeable one when bad. It should also cut firm without 
crumbling. The females are as full of roe as our carp, which 
is taken out and spread upon a table, beat flat, and sprinkled 
with salt ; it is then dried in the air and sun, and afterwards 
in ovens: it should be of a reddish brown colour, and 
very dry. This is called caviare, and is eaten with oil and 
vinegar. 

Cod. 

A COD should be very thick at the neck, the flesh very white 
and firm, and of a bright clear colour, and the gills red. 
When they are flabby, they are not good. They are in 
season from Christmas to Lady-day. 

Skate. 

THIS fish should be very' white and thick. When they 
are too fresh, they eat tough ; and if stale, they have a very 
disagreeable smell : so that some judgment is required to dress 
them in proper time. 

Herrings. 

THE gills of a fresh herring are of a fine red, their eyes 
full, and the whole fish stiff and very bright ; but if the gills 
are of a faint colour, the fish limber and wrinkled, they are 
bad. The goodness of pickled herrings is known by their 
being fat, fleshy, and white. Good red herrings are large, 
firm, and dry. They should be full of roe or milt, and the 
outside of them of a fine yellow. 

* Trout. 

ALL the kinds of this fine fresh-water fish are excellent : 
but the best are those that are red and yellow. The female 
are most in esteem, and are known by having a smaller head 
and deeper body than the male. They are high in season 
the latter end of June ; and their freshness may be known by 
the rule we have already laid down for that purpose, con- 
cerning other fish. 

Tench. 

THIS is also a fresh-water fish, and is in season in July, 
August, and September. This fish should be dressed alive ; 
but if they be dead, examine their gills, which should be red, 
and hard to open, the eyes bright, and the body firm and 
stiff 7 , if fresh. Some are covered with a slimy matter, which, 
if clear and bright, is a good sign.

18 MARKETING. 

Salmon. 

THE flesh of salmon, when new, is of a fine red, and par- 
ticularly so at the gills ; the scales should be bright, and the 
fish very stiff. The spring is the season for this fish ; but 
whether that caught in the Thames, or the Severn, be best, is 
a matter of some dispute. 

Smelts. 

WHEN perfectly fresh they are of a fine silver hue, 
very firm, and have an agreeable smell, resembling that of a 
cucumber. 

Eels. 

THE Thames silver eel is generally the most esteemed ; 
and the worst are those brought by the Dutch, and sold at 
Billingsgate market. They should be dressed alive ; and they 
are always in season? except during the hot summer months. 

Flounders. 

THIS fish is found in the sea as well as rivers, and should 
be dressed alive. They are in season from January to March, 
and from July to September. When fresh, they are stiff', 
their eyes bright and full, and their bodies thick. 

Oysters. 

THE Colchester, Pyfleet, and Milford oysters, are esteemed 
the best: though the native Milton are reckoned very good, 
being the fattest and whitest. They are known to be alive 
and vigorous when they close fast upon the knife, and let go 
as soon as they are wounded in the body. 

Prawns and Shrimps. 

THEY have an excellent smell when in perfection ; are firm 
and stiff, and their tails turn stiffly inwards. Their colour is 
very bright, when fresh; but when stale, their tails grow 
Umber, the brightness of their colour goes off, and they be- 
come pale and clammy. 

Butter. 

IN buying of butter, you must not trust to the taste the 
seller gives you, lest he give you a taste of one lump, and sell 
you another. In choosing salt butter, trust rather to your 
smell than taste, by putting a knife into it, anil applying it to 
your nose. If the butter be in a cask, have it unhooped, and 
thrust in your knife, between the staves, into the middle of 
it ; for the top of the cask is sometimes better butter than the 
middle, owing to artful package. 



TRUSSING. 19 

Cheese. 

OBSERVE the coat of your cheese before you purchase it; 
for if it be old, with a rough and ragged coat, or dry at top, 
you may expect to find little worms or mites in it. If it is 
moist, spongy, or full of holes, it will give reason to suspect 
that it is maggoty. Whenever you perceive any perished 
places on the outside, be sure to probe to the bottom of 
them ; for, though the hole in the coat may be but small, the 
perished part within may be considerable. 

Eggs. 

To judge properly of an egg, put the greater end to your 
tongue, and if it feel warm it is new ; but if cold, it is stale ; 
and according to the degree of heat or cold there is in the egg, 
you will judge of its staleness or newness. AnotrTer method 
is, hold it up against the sun or candle, and if the yolk appear 
round and the white clear and fair, it is a mark of goodness ; 
but if the yolk be broken, and the white cloudy or muddy, 
the egg is a bad one. Some people, in order to try the good- 
ness of an egg, put it into a pan of Cold water : the fresher it 
is, the sooner it will sink to the bottom ; but if it be addled or 
rotten, it will swim on the surface of the water. The best 
method of preserving eggs is to keep them in meal or bran ; 
though some place them in wood-ashes, with their small end 
downwards. -When necessity obliges you to keep them for 
any length of time, the best way will be to bury them in salt, 
which will preserve them in almost any climate ; but the 
sooner an egg is used, the better it will be.

DIRECTIONS FOR TRUSSING. 

PRELIMINARY HINTS AND OBSERVATIONS. 



HOUGH the London poulterers truss every thing before they 
nd it home, yet it is absolutely necessary that every COOK

send 

should know how to perform this business properly, as it 
frequently happens that families take their cooks with them 
into the country, where they are obliged to draw and truss all 
kinds of poultry and game themselves. Let them therefore 
be careful to attend to this general rule ; take care that 'all the 
stubs are perfectly removed ; and when they draw any kind 

c 2 



20 TRUSSING. 



of poultry or game, they must be very particular not to break 
the gall, because it will give the bird a bitter and disagree- 
able flavour, which neither washing nor wiping will be able to 
remove. We shall now proceed to particular rules. 

Turkeys. 




WHEN you have properly picked your turkey, break the 
kg-bone close to the foot, and draw out the strings from the 
thigh, for Vhich purpose you must put it on a hook fastened 
against the wall. Cut off the neck close to the back ; but be 
careful to leave the orop skin sufficiently long to turn over to 
the back. Then proceed to take out the crop, and loosen 
the liver and gut at the throat end with your middle finger. 
Then cut off the vent, and take out the gut. With a crooked 
sharp-pointed iron pull out the gizzard, and the liver will soon 
follow. Be careful, however, not to break the gall. With a 
wet cloth wipe out the inside perfectly clean. With a large 
knife cut the breast-bone through on each side close to the 
back, and draw the legs close to the crop. Then put a 
cloth on the breast, and beat the high bone down with a rolU 
ing-pin till it lies flat. If the turkey is to be trussed for boil- 
ing cut the legs off; then put your middle finger into the in- 
side, raise the skin of the legs, and put them under the apron 
of the turkey. Put a skewer in the joint of the wing and the 
middle joint of the leg, and run it through the body and the 
other leg and wing. The liver and gizzard must be put in the 
pinions; but take care first to open the gizzard, and take out 
the filth and the gall of the liver. Then turn the small end 
of the pinion on the back, and tie a packthread over the ends 
of the legs to keep them in their places. If the turkey is to 
be roasted, leave the legs on, put a skewer in the joint of the 
wing, tuck the legs close up, and put the skewer through the 
middle of the leg and body. On the other side put another 
skewer in at the small part of the leg. Put it close on the 
outside of the sidesman, and put the skewer through, and the 
same on the other side. Put the liver and gizzard between the 
pinions, and turn the point of the pinion on the back. Then 
put, close above the pinions, another skewer through the 
body of the turkey. 



TRUSSING. 2 1 



Turkey polts must be trussed in the following manner : 
Take the neck from the head and body, but do not remove 
the neck skin. They are drawn in the same manner as a 
turkey. Put a skewer through the joint of the pinion, tuck 
the legs close, run the skewer through the middle of the leg, 
through the body, and so on the other side. Cut off the un- 
der part of the bill, twist the skin of the neck round, and put 
the head on the point of the skewer, with the bill end for- 
wards. Another skewer must be put in the sidesman, and the 
legs placed between the sidesman and apron on each side. 
Pass the skewer through all, and cut off the toe-nails. It is 
very common to lard them on the breast. The liver and 
gizzard may or may not be used, as you like. 

Geese. 




HAVING picked and stubbed your goose clean, cut the feet 
off at the joint, and the pinion off at the first joint. Then cut 
off the neck close to the back ; but leave the skin of the neck 
long enough to turn over the back. Pull out the throat, and 
tie a knot at the end. With your middle finger loosen the 
liver and other matters at the breast end, and cut it open be- 
tween the vent and the rump. Having done this, draw out all 
the entrails, excepting the soal. Wipe it out clean with a wet 
cloth, and beat the breast-bone flat with a rolling-pin. Put a 
skewer into the wing, and draw the legs close up. Put the 
skewer through the middle of the leg, and through the body, 
and the same on the other side. Put another skewer in the 
small of the leg, tuck it close down to the sidesman, run it 
through, and do the same on the other side. Cut off the end 
of the vent, and make a hole large enough for the passage of 
the rump, as it holds the seasoning much better by 
means. 



22 TRUSSING. 

Ducks. 





DUCKS and Geese are trussed in the same manner, ex- 
cepting that the feet are left on the ducks, and are turned 
close to the legs. 

Fowls. 




THEY must first be picked very clean, and the neck cut off 
close to the back. Then take out the crop, and with your 
middle finger loosen the liver and other matters. Cut off the 
vent, draw it clean, and beat the breast-bone flat with a rolling- 
pin. If your fowl is to be boiled, cut off the nails of the feet, 
and tuck them down close to the leg. Put your finger into the 
inside, and raise the skin of the legs ; then cut a hole in the 
top of the skin, and put the legs under. Put a skewer in the 
first joint of the pinion, bring the middle of the leg close to 
it, put the skewer through the middle of the leg, and through 
the body. Do the same on the other side. Having opened 
the gizzard, take out the filth, and the gall out of the liver. 
Put the gizzard and the liver in the pinions, and turn the point 
on the back. Remember to tie a string over the tops of the 
legs, to keep them in their proper place. If your fowl is to be 
roasted, put a skewer in the first joint of the pinion, and 
bring the middle of the leg close to it. Put the skewer through 
the middle of the leg, and through the body, and do the same 
on the other side. Put another skewer in the small of the leg, 
and through the sidesman. Do the same on the other side. 
Put another skewer through the skin of the feet. You must 
not forget that the nails are to be cut off. 



TRUSSING. 23 

Chickens. 




THESE must be picked and drawn in the same manner as 
fowls. If the chickens are to be boiled, cut off the nails, 
give the sinews a nick on each side of the joint, put the feet 
in at the vent, and then put in the rump. Draw the skin tight 
over the legs, put a skewer in the first joint of the pinion, and 
bring the middle of the leg close. Put the skewer through 
the middle of the legs, and through the body, and do the same 
on the other side. Clean the gizzard, and take out the gall 
in the liver ; put them into the pinions, and turn the points 
on the back. If your chickens are to be roasted, cut off the 
feet, put a skewer in the first joint of the pinions, and bring 
the middle of the leg close. Run the skewer through the 
middle of the leg, and through the body, and do the same on 
the other side. Put another skewer into the sidesman, put 
the legs between the apron and the sidesman, and run the 
skewer through. Having cleaned the liver and gizzard, put 
them in the pinions, turn the points on the back and over 
the neck, and pull the breast skin. 

Wild Fowl. 

THE directions we are giving will answer for all kinds of 
wild fowl in general. Having picked them clean, cut off the 
neck close to the back, and with your middle finger loosen 
the liver and guts next the breast. Cut off the pinions at the 
first joint, then cut a slit between the vent and the rump, and 
draw them clean. Clean them properly with the long feathers 
on the wing, cut off the nails, and turn the feet close to the 
legs. Put a skewer into the pinions, pull the legs close to 
the breast, and run the skewer through the legs, body, and 
the other pinion. First cut off the vent, and then put the 
rump through it. 

Pigeons. 




You must first pick them, and cut off the neck close to the 
back. Then take out the crop, cut off the vent, and draw out 



24 TRUSSING. 

the guts and gizzard, but leave in the liver, for a pigeon has no 
gall. If your pigeons are to be roasted, cut off the toes, cut 
a slit in one of the legs, and put the other through it. Draw 
the leg tight lo the pinion, put a skewer through the pinions, 
legs, and body, and with the handle of.a knife break the breast 
flat. Clean the gizzard, put it in one of the pinions, and turn 
the point on the back. If you intend to make a pie of them, 
you must cut the feet off at the joint, turn the legs, and stick 
them in the sides close to the pinions. If they are to be 
stewed or boiled, they must be done in the same manner. 

Woodcocks and Sniper. 




THESE birds are very tender to pick, especially if they be 
not quite fresh. They must therefore be handled as little as 
possible, for even the heat of the hand will sometimes pull 
off the skin, when the beauty of your bird will be destroyed. 
When you have picked them clean, cut the pinions off at the 
first joint, and with the handle of a knife beat the breast-bone 
flat. Turn the legs close to the thighs, and tie them together 
at the joints. Put the thighs close to the pinions, put a skewer 
into the pinion, and run it through the thighs, body, and the 
other pinion. Skin the head, turn it, take out the eyes and 
put the head on the point of the skewer with the bill close to 
the breast. Woodcocks, snipes, or plovers, are trussed in the 
same nrtgpfiner, but must never be drawn. 
'- 

Larks, Wheat-ears, Kc. 

WHRN you have picked them clean, cut off their heads, 
and the pinions at the first joint. Beat the breast-bone flat 
with the handle of a knife, turn the feet close to the legs, and 
put one into the other. Draw out the gizzard, and run a 
skewer through the middle of the bodies of as many as you 
mean to dress. They must be tied on the spit. 

Pheasants and Partridges. 




PICK them very clean, cut a slit at the back of the neck, 
take out the crop, and loosen the liver and gut next the breast 



TRUSSING. 25 



with your fore-finger, then cut off the vent and draw them. 
Cut oft the pinion at the first joint, and wipe out the inside 
with the pinion you have cut off; for you never need pick 
these birds beyond U^e first joint of the pinion. With a roll- 
ing-pin beat the breast-bone flat, put a skewer in the pinion, 
and bring the middle of the legs close. Then run the skewer 
through the legs, body, and the other pinion; bring the head, 
and put it on the end of the skewer, the bill fronting the breast. 
Put another skewer into the sidesman, and put the legs close 
on each side the apron, and then run the skewer through all. 
You must leave the beautiful feathers on the head of the cock 
pheasant, and put paper to prevent the bad effects of the fire. 
You must also save the long feathers in the tajl to stick in the 
rump when roasted. In the same manner are trussed all kinds 
of moor-game. If they are to be boiled, put the legs in the 
manner as in trussing a fowl for boiling. 

Hares. 




.HAVING cut off the four legs at the first joint, raise the skin 

of the back, and draw it over the hind legs. Leave the tail 

whole, draw the skin over the hack, and slip out the fore legs. 

Cut the skin off the neck and head; but take care to leave the 

ears on, and mind to skin them. Take out the liver, lights, &c. 

but be sure to take the gut out of the vent. Cut the sinews 

that lie under the hind legs, bring them up to the fore legs, 

put a skewer through the hind leg, then through the foreleg 

under the joint, run it through the body, and do the same on 

lie other side. Put another skewer through the thick part of 

te hind legs and body, put the head between the shoulders, 

ard run a skewer through to keep it in its place. Pur askewer 

inachear to make them stand erect, and tie a string round 

the middle of the body over the legs to keep them in their 

pla<. You may truss a young fawn in the same manner, 

only-mind to cut off the ears. 



26 BOILING. 

Rabbits. 




RABBITS are to be cased ih the same manner as hares, only 
observe to cut off the ears close to the head. Cut the vent 
open, and slit the legs about an inch upon each side the rump. 
Make the hind legs Jie flat, and bring the ends to the fore legs. 
Put a skewer in the hind leg, then in the fore leg and through 
the body. Bring the head round, and put it on the skewer. 
If you want to roast two together, truss them at full length, 
with six skewers run through them both, so that they may be 
properly fastened upon the spit.

BOILING. 

PRELIMINARY HINTS AND OBSERVATIONS. 

-TN FATNESS being a most material requisition in a kitchen, the 
cook should be particularly cautious to keep all the utensils 
perfectly clean, and the pots and saucepans properly tinned. 
In boiling any kind of meat, but particularly veal, much care 
and nicety are required. Fill your pot with a sufficient quan- 
tity of soft water; dust your veal well with fine flour, put it 
into your pot, and set it over a large fire. It is" the custom 
with some people to put in milk to make it white ; but this if 
of no use, and perhaps better omitted ; for, if you use har 
water, it will curdle the milk, give to the veal a brownisl- 
yellow cast, and will often hang in lumps about it. Oatmal 
will do the same thing ; but by dusting your veal, and puttng 
it into the water when cold, it will prevent the foulness of the 
water from hanging upon it. Take the scum off clear as.oon 
as it begins to rise, and cover up the pot closely. Le- the 
meat boil as slowly as possible, put in plenty of water, */hich 
will make your veal rise and look plump. A cook Cannot 
make a greater mistake, than to let any sort of meat b>il fast, 
since it hardens the outside before it is warm within, fld con- 
tributes to discolour it. Thus a leg of veal, of twelv--pounds 
weight, will take three hours and a half boiling ; and the 
slower it boils, the whiter and plumper it will be. Vhen mut- 



BOILING. 21 

ton or beef is the object of your cookery, be careful to dredge 
them well with flour, before you put them into the pot of 
cold water, and keep it covered ; but do not forget to take 
off the scum as often as it rises. Mutton and beef do not re- 
quire so much boiling; nor is it much minded if it be a little 
under the mark; but lamb, pork, and veal, should be well 
boiled, as they will otherwise be unwholesome. A leg of 
pork will take half an hour more boiling than a leg of veal 
of the same weight; but, in general, when you boil beef or 
mutton, you may allow an hour for every four pounds weight. 
To put in the meat when the water is cold, is allowed to be 
the best method, as it thereby gets warm to the heart before 
the outside gets hard. To boil a leg of lamb, of four pounds 
\)'eight, you must allow an hour and a half. 

Grass Lamb, 

So many pounds as the joint weighs, so many quarters of 
an hour it must boil. Serve it up with spinach, carrots, cab- 
bage, or brocoli. 

Calf's Head. ' 

WASH it very clean, soak it in water for two hours, then 
parboil one half ; beat up the yolk of an egg, and rub it over 
the head with a feather ; then strew over it a seasoning of pep- 
per, salt, thyme, parsley chopped small, shred lemon-peel, 
grated bread, and a little nutmeg ; stick bits of butter over it, 
and send it to the oven. Boil the other half white in a cloth ; 
put them both .into a dish Boil the brains in a bit of cloth, 
with a very little parsley, and a leaf or two of sage. When 
they are boiled, chop them small, and warm them in a sauce- 
pan, with a bit of butter, and a little pepper and salt. Lay 
the tongue, boiled and peeled, in the middle of a small dish, 
and the brains round it ; have, in another dish, bacon or 
pickled pork ; greens or carrots in another. 

To boil Veal like Sturgeon. 

TAKE a small delicate fillet of veal, from a cow-calf; take 
off the skin, and then lard it all over, top, bottom, and sides 
with some bacon and ham. Put into a stevvpan some slices of 
bacon and veal ; strew over them some pepper, salt, and sweet 
herbs; then put in the fillet with as-much broth as will just 
cover them. Cover the stewpan very close, and let them sim- 
mer very gently. When the veal is nearly enough, put in a 
pint of white wine, an onion shred, a few cloves, and a little 
mace ; put on the cover of the stewpau, set it over a stove, 
and lay some charcoal upon it. When it has been kept hot 
ten minutes, take it off the fire, and remove the charcoal. If 
it is intended to be eaten hot, the following sauce must be 



2S BOILING. 

made while it is stewing. Set on a saucepan, with a glass of 
gravy, a glass and a half of vinegar, half a lemon sliced, a 
large onion sliced, and a good deal of pepper and salt. Boil 
this a few minutes, and strain it. Lay the meat in a dish, and 
pour the sauce over it. If it is to be eaten cold, it must not 
be taken out of the liquor it is stewed in, but set by to cool 
all night, and it will be exceedingly good. 

Haunch or Neck of Venison. 

HAVING let it lie in salt for a week, boil it in a cloth well 
floured ; and allow a quarter of an hour's boiling for every 
pound it weighs. For sauce, you may boil some cauliflowers^ 
pulled into Tittle sprigs, in milk and water, with some fine 
white cabbage, and some turnips cut in dice, add some beet- 
root cut into narrow pieces, about an inch and a half long, and 
half an inch thick. Lay a sprig of cauliflower, and some of 
the turnips mashed with some cream and a little butter. Let 
your cabbage be boiled, and then beat in a saucepan with a 
piece of butter and salt. Lay that next the cauliflower, then 
the turnips, then the cabbage, and so on till the dish be full. 
Place the beet-root here and there, according to your taste. 
Have a little melted butter. This is a very fine dish, and 
looks very prettily. 

The haunch or neck, thus dressed, eats well the next day 
hashed with gravy and sweet sauce. 

Hams. 

PUT your ham into a copper of cold water, and when it 
boils, take care that it boils slowly. A ham of twenty pounds 
will take four hours and a half boiling : and so in proportion 
for one of a larger or smaller size. No soaking is required 
for a green ham ; but an old and large ham will require six- 
teen hours soaking in water, after which it should lie on damp 
stones, sprinkled with water, two or three days to mellow. 
Observe to keep the pot well skimmed while your ham is 
boiling. When you take it up, pull oft' the skin as whole as 
possible, and save it ; and strew on it raspings. When the ham 
is brought from table, put the skin upon it, which will pre- 
serve it moist. 

Another way of dressing a Ham. 

HAVING put the ham in a copper as before, add two pounds 
of veal : after boiling a quarter of an hour, add celery, three 
heads ; young onions one handful, or one old one ; thyme 
and sweet-marjorum, a small quantity; t\yo turnips; winter 
savory, one handful ; one or two eschalots ; and boil as be- 
fore, till sufficiently tender. The broth will form a valuable 
present to poor families. 



BOILING. 29 

Tongues. 

STEEP the tongue in water all night, if it be a dry one ; 
but if it be a pickled one, only wash it out of water. Boil it 
three hour*. 

Pickled Pork. 

HAVING washed your pork, and scraped it clean, let it lie 
half an hour in cold water, put it in when the water is cold, 
and let it boil till the rind be tender. 

Leg of Mutton with Cauliflowers and Spinach. 

Cur a leg of mutton venison fashion, and boil it in a cloth : 
boil three or four cauliflowers in milk and water, pull them into 
sprigs, and stew them with butter, pepper, salt, and a little 
milk ; stew some spinach in a saucepan; put to the spinach a 
quarter of a pint of gravy, a piece of butter, and flower. 
When it is enough, put the mutton in the middle* the spinach 
round it, and the cauliflower over all. The butter the cauli- 
flower was stewed in must be poured over it, and it must be 
melted like a smooth cream. 

Chickens. 

PUT your chickens into scalding water, and as soon as the 
feathers will slip off, take them out, otherwise they will make 
the skin hard. After you have drawn them, lay them in skim- 
med milk for two hours, and then truss them with their heads 
on their wings. When you have properly singed, and dusted 
them with flour, cover them close in cold water, and set them 
over a slow fire. Having taken off the scum, and boiled them 
slowly for five or six minutes, take them off the fire, and keep 
them close covered for half an hour in the water, which will 
stew them sufficiently, and make them plump and white. 
Before you dish them, set them on the fire to heat ; then 
drain them, and pour over them white sauce. See Sauces. 

Fowls. 

PLUCK your fowls, draw them at the rump, and cut off the 
head, neck, and legs. Take out the breast-bone carefully; 
and having skewered them with the ends of their legs in their 
bodies, tie them round with a string. Singe and dust them 
well with flour, put them into cold water, cover the kettle 
close, and set it on the fire; but take it off as soon as the 
scum begins to rise. Cover them close again, and let them 
boil twenty minutes very slowly. Then take them off, and 
'he heat of the water, in half an hour, will stew them suffi- 



30 BOILING. 

ciently. Then treat them in the same manner as above di- 
rected for chickens, though melted butter is as often used as 
white sauce. 

Turkeys. 

A TURKEY should not be fed the day before it is to be 
killed ; but give it a spoonful of allegar just before you kill it, 
and it will make it white and tender. Let it hang by the legs 
four or five days after it is killed ; and when you have plucked 
it, draw it at the rump. Cut off the legs, put the end of the 
thighs into the body, and skewer them clown, and tic them 
with a string. Having cut off the head and neck, grate a 
penny Joaf, chop fine a score of oysters at least, shred a little 
lemon-peel, and put in a sufficient quantity of salt, pepper, 
and nutmeg. Mix these up into a light forcemeat, with a 
quarter of a pound of butter, three eggs, a spoonful or two of 
cream, and stuff the craw with part of it ; the rest must be 
made into balls, and boiled. Having sewed up the turkey, 
and dredged it well with flour, put it into a kettle of cold 
water ; cover it, and set it over the fire, and take the scum 
off as soon as it begins to rise, and cover it again. It must 
boil very slowly for half an hour; then take off your kettle, 
and let it stand close covered. A middling turkey will take 
half an hour to stand in the hot water, and the steam being- 
confined will sufficiently stew it. When you dish it up, pour 
a little of your oyster-sauce over it, lay your balls round it, 
and serve it up, with the rest of your sauce in a boat. Bar- 
berries and lemon will be a proper garnish. Set it over the 
fire, and make it quite hot before you dish it up. 

Geese. 

SALT a goose a week, and boil it an hour. Serve it up with 
onion sauce, or cabbage boiled or stewed in butter. 

Another way. 

SINGE a goose, and pour over it a quart of boiling milk. 
Let it lie in it all night, then take it out, and dry it well with 
a cloth. Cut small a large onion and some sage, put them into 
the goose, sew it up at the neck and vent, hang it up by the 
legs till next day, then put it into a pot of cold water, cover it 
close, and let it boil softly for an hour. Onion sauce. 

A smoked Goose. 

TAKE a large stubble goose, take off the fat, dry it well 
inside and " out with a cloth ; wash it all over with vinegar, 
and then rub it over with some common salt, salt-petre, and 



BOILING. 31 

A quarter of a pound of coarse sugar. Rub the salts well in, 
and let it lay a fortnight; then drain it well-, sew it up in a 
cloth, and dry it in the middle of a chimney. It should hang 
a month. Serve it up with onions, greens, &c. 

Ducks. 

As soon as you have scalded and drawn your ducks, let 
them remain for a few minutes in warm water, then take them 
out, put them into an earthen pan, and pour a pint of boiling 
milk over them. Let them lie in it two or three hours/ and 
when you take them out, dredge them well with flour; put 
them into a copper of cold water, and cover them up. Hav- 
ing boiled slowly about twenty minutes, take them out, and 
smother them with onion sauce. 

Pigeons. 

SCALD and draw your pigeons, and take out the craAv as 
clean as possible. Wash them in several waters ; and having 
cut off their pinions, turn their legs under their wings; dredge 
them, and put them into soft cold water. Having boiled them 
very slowly a quarter of an hour, dish them up, and pour over 
them good melted butter ; lay round them a little brocoli, and 
^ervethem up with butter and parsley. 

Rabbits. 

CASE your rabbits ; skewer them with their heads straight 
up, the fore legs brought down, and the hind legs straight. 
Boil them at least three quarters of an hour, and then smother 
them with onion sauce. Pull out the jaw bones, stick them in 
their eyes, and serve them up with a sprig of myrtle or bar- 
berries in their mouths. See Sauces. 

Partridges. 

BOIL them quick in a good deal of water, and fifteen mi- 
nutes will be sufficient. For sauce take a quarter of a pint 
of cream, and a piece of fresh butter as large as a walnut; 
stir it one way till it be melted, and pour it into the dish. 

Pheasants. 

BOIL your pheasants in a good deal of water, and be sure 
to keep it boiling. If it be a small one, half an hour will boil 
it ; but if it be of the larger sort, you must allow it a quarter 
of an hour longer. Let your sauce be celery stewed and 
thickened with cream, and a little piece of butter rolled in 
flour; and when your pheasant is done, pour your sauce over 
it, and garnish with lemon. Observe so to stew your celery, 
that the liquor may not be all wasted before you put in your 
cream. Season with salt to your palate. See Sauces. 



BOILING. 

Snipes or Woodcocks. 

YOUR snipes or woodcocks must be boiled in a good strong 
broth $ or beef gravy, made thus: cut a pound of beef into little 
^pieces, and pour on it two qiwts of water, with an onion, 
a bundle of sweet herbs, a blade or two of mace, six cloves, 
and some whole pepper. Cover it close, let it boil till about 
half wasted, then strain it off, and put the gravy into a sauce- 
pan, with salt enough to season it. Gut the birds clean, but 
take care of the trails. Put them into the gravy, cover them 
close, and ten minutes will boil them. In the meantime, cut 
the trails and liver small, then take a little of the gravy the 
snipes are boiling in, and stew the trails in it, with a blade of 
mace. Fry some crumbs of bread crisp in some butter, of a 
fine light brown. You must take about as much bread as the 
inside of a stale roll, and rub them small into a clean cloth ; 
and when they are done, let them stand ready in a plate before 
the fire. When your snipes are ready, take about half a pint 
of the liquor they were boiled in, and add to the trails two 
spoonfuls of red wine, and a piece of butter as big as a wal- 
nut, rolled in a little flour. Set them on the fire, shake your 
saucepan often, (but do not stir it with a spoon) till the but- 
ter is all melted. Then put in the crumbs, give the saucepan 
a shake, take up your birds, lay them in the dish, and pour 
your sauce over thetn. Lemon is a proper garnish. 

Pig's Pettitoes. 

LET the feet boil till they are pretty tender ; but take up 
the heart, liver, and lights, when they have boiled ten minutes, 
and shred them rather small. Take out the feet, and split 
them ; thicken your gravy with flour and butter, and put in 
yeur mincemeat, a little mace, a slice of lemon, a little salt, 
and give it a gentle boil. Lay s'ppets round the dish, and 
pour in your mincemeat, and in the centre the pettitoes. 

Salmon. 

HAVING scalded your salmon, take out the blood, wash the 
fish well, and lay it on a fish plate. Put your water in a fish- 
pan, with a little salt, and when it boils, put in your fish for 
half a minute ; then take it out for a minute or two. Do this 
four times, and then boil it till it be enough. When you take 
it out of the fish-pan, set it over the water to drain, and cover 
it with a cloth dipped in hot water. Frv a few slices of salmon, 
or some small fish, and lay them round it. Scraped horse- 
radish and parsley will be a proper garnish. 



BOILING. 33 

Soles. 

THEY must be boiled in salt and water, and served up 
"with anchovy sauce. 

Soles the Dutch way. 

TAKE a pair of large soles, skin, gut, and wash them very 
clean in spring-water. Set them on in a stewpan with some 
water and a little salt, and when it boils put in the soles, and 
let them boil a few minutes. Then put on a saucepan with 
some parsley cut small in a little water, and let it stand till 
the water is all consumed. Then shake in some flour, and 
put in a good piece of butter. Shake them well together till 
all is well mixed, and then lay the soles, when they are drained, 
upon a dish, and pour the sauce over them. 

Trout. 

BOIL them in vinegar, water, and salt, with a piece of horse- 
radish. White sauce, anchovy saute, and plain butter. 

Cod's Head. 

FIRST take out the gills and the blood clean from the bone, 
and wash the head well ; then rub over it a little salt, and a 
glass of vinegar. Lay it on your fish-plate, and when your 
water boils, throw in a large handful of salt, and a glass of 
vinegar. Put in your fish, and boil it gently half an hour; but 
if it be a large one, it will take three quarters. Take it up 
very carefully, and see that no water or scum hang about the 
fish. Garnish with a few smelts, or oysters fried, parsley, 
scraped horse-radish, and lemon cut in slices, laid round it. 
The roe and liver must be cut into slices, and laid close to it. 

Salt Cod. 

SOAK the fish six hours in soft water, then lay it on a stone 
or brick floor for eight hours : if very salt, repeat the soaking 
for six hours, otherwise three will be sufficient, and lay it 
again on the floor for two. Brush it well with a moderately 
hard brush, and boil gently in soft water. Serve in a napkin. 
Thus dressed it will swell considerably, and come off in fine 
flakes. Serve with egg sauce, mashed potatoes, and par- 
snips. 

Cod Sounds. 

SOAK them in warm water half an hour, then scrape and 
clean ; boil in milk and water till tender. Serre in a napkin, 
with egg sauce. 

D 



34 BOILING. 

Turbot. 

YOUR turbot must be washed clean. Rub some vinegar 
over it, which will add to its firmness, Put it on your fish- 
plate, with the white side upwards, and pin a cloth over it 
tight under your plate, which will prevent its breaking. Boil 
it gently in hard water with plenty of salt and vinegar, and 
skim it well, which will prevent the skin being discoloured ; 
and when enough, take it up and drain it. Take the cloth 
off carefully, and slip the fish on your dish ; garnish with 
double parsley, lemon, and horse-radish. The proper sauces, 
are lobster, anchovy, and plain butter. See Sauces. 

Turbot boiled with Capers. 

WASH and dry a small turbot, then take some thyme, pars- 
ley, sweet herbs, and an onion sliced. Put them into a stew- 
pan, then lay in the turbot, (the stewpan should be just big 
enough to hold the fish.) Strew over the fish the same herbs 
that are under it, with some chives and sweet basil. Then 
pour in an equal quantity of white wine and white wine vine- 
gar, till the fish is covered. Strew in a little bay salt, with 
some whole pepper ; set the stewpan over a gentle stove, in- 
creasing the heat by degrees, till it be enough. Then take it 
off the fire, but do not take the turbot out. Set a saucepan on 
the fire with a pound of butter, two anchovies split, boned and 
washed, two large spoonfuls of capers cut small, some chives 
whole, and a little pepper, salt, some nutmeg grated, a little 
flour, a spoonful of vinegar, and a little water. Set the sauce- 
pan over the stove, and keep shaking it round for some time, 
and then set the turbot on to make it hot. Put it in a dish, 
and pour some of the sauce over it ; lay some horse-radish 
round it, and put what remains of the sauce in a boat. 

Pike. 

GUT and gill your pike, and having washed it well, make 
a good forcemeat of chopped oysters, crumb of bread, a little 
lemon-peel shred fine, a lump of butter, the yolks of two eggs, 
a few sweet herbs, and season them to your taste with salt, 
pepper, and nutmeg. Mix all these well together, and put 
them into the belly of the fish, which must be sewed up, and 
skewered round. It must be boiled in hard water, with a 
little salt, and a tea-cup full of vinegar put into the fish-pan. 
Put in the fish as soon as the water boils, and if it be of the 
middling size, half an hour's boiling will be sufficient. Serve 
it up with oyster sauce in a boat. Use pickled barberries ami 
parsley for a garnish. 



BOILING. 35 

Sturgeon. 

LAY as large a piece as you please of your fish all night in 
salt water, having first taken care to wash it clean. Take it 
out the next morning, and rub it well with vinegar, and let it 
lie in it two hours. Put your sturgeon into the fish-kettle 
when full of boiling water, and throw in an ounce of bay-salt, 
a few sprigs of sweet marjorum, and two large onions. When 
you perceive the bones begin to leave the fish, take it up, and 
strip off the skin ; then flour it well ; put it before the fire, and 
having basted it with fresh butter, let it stand till it be of a 
fine brown. When you dish it up, you must make use of the 
white sauce. Crisp parsley and red pickles, for garnish. See 
Sauces. 

MackareL 

WHEN you have gutted your mackarel, dry them carefully 
in a clean cloth, and gently rub them over with vinegar. Lay 
them on your fish-plate, and handle them as little as possible, 
as they are liable to break. Put them into your fish-pan when 
your water boils, put in a little salt, and let them boil gently 
about a quarter of an hour. When you take them up, drain 
them well, and serve them with fennel and parsley sauces. 
Your fish must be dished up with their tails in the middle, 
;>nd scraped horse-radish and barberries will serve as garnish. 

Flat Fish. 

UNDER this article we include flounders, plaice, and the 
various species of flat fish of that tribe. First cut off the fins, 
nick the brown side under the head, and take out the guts. 
Dry them with a cloth, and boil them in salt and water. Gar- 
nish them with parsley, and serve them up either with shrimp, 
cockle, or anchovy sauce. 

Herrings. 

SCALE, gut, and wash them, clean and dry them, and rub 
them over with a little salt and vinegar. Skewer their tails in 
their mouths, and lay them on your fish-plate. Put them in 
when the water boils, and in about ten or twelve minutes take 
them up. Let them drain properly, and then turn their heads 
into the middle of the dish. Use parsley and butter for sauce, 
and garnish with scraped horse-radish. 

Perch. 

WHEN you have scaled, gutted, and washed your fish, put 
it into the water when it boils, with some salt, an onion cut 
into slices, and separated into round rings, a handful of parsley 

D2 



36 ROASTING. 



clean picked and washed, and as much milk as will turn the 
water. Put the fish into a soup dish as soon as it is enough, 
and pour a little of the water, and the parsley and the onions, 
over it. It may be served up with butter and parsley in a 
boat, and with or without onions, as you choose. The same 
methgd may be observed in boiling a trout. 



Eels. 

HAVING skinned, gutted, and taken the blood out of your 
eels, cut off their heads, dry them, and turn them round on 
your fish-plate. Boil them in salt ami water, and serve them 
up with parsley sauce, and anchovy sauce. 

Mullets. 

BOIL them in salt and water ; when they are enough, pour 
avray part of the water, and put to the rest a gill of red wine, 
sonje salt and vinegar, two onions sliced, with a bunch of 
sweet herbs, some nutmeg, beaten mace, and the juice of a 
lemon. Boil these well together, with two or three anchovies. 
Then 'put ifc the fish, and when they have simmered in it 
some time, put them into a dish, and strain the sauce ore 1 ' 
them. Shrimps or oysters may be added. 



CHAPTER IV. 

ROASTING. 

PRELIMINARY HINTS AND OBSERVATIONS. 

I: UT a little salt and water into the dripping-pan, and with it 
baste the meajs a little. When dry, dredge well with flour, 
and baste with fresh butter ; because it will give a better 
colour to your meat. The fire should be regulated accord- 
ing to the thing to be dressed : if very little or thin, then you 
should have a pretty brisk fire, that it may be done quickly 
and nicely ; if a large joint, take care, that a large fire is 
laid on to cake. The fire must be always clear at the bot- 
tom ; and when the meat is half done, move the dripping-parr 
and spit a little from the fire, and stir it up, to make it burn 
clear and brisk ; for a good fire is a material thing in the bu- 
siness of cookery. If you are roasting beef, take care to 
paper the top, and baste well while a the fire, not forgetting 
to sprinkle some salt on it. When the smoke draws to the 



ROASTING. 37 

fire, it is a sign that it is nearly enough ; and then take off 
the paper, baste well, and dredge with flour, to make it 
frothy ; but never salt your meat before you lay it to the fire, 
as that will draw out part of the gravy. In roasting mutton or 
lamb, the loin, the chine, and the saddle, must have the skin 
raised and skewered on, and when nearly done, take off the 
skin, and baste and flour, to froth it up. All other sorts .of 
mutton and lamb must be roasted with a quick clear fire, with- 
out the skin being raised. You must be careful to roast veal 
of a fine brown ; and if it be a fillet or loin, be sure to paper 
the fat, that you may lose as little of it as possible. At first 
keep it at some distance from the fire, but when it is soaked, 
put it nearer. When you lay it down, baste well with but- 
ter ; and when nearly done, baste again, and dredge with a 
little flour. The breast must be roasted with the caul on, till 
the meat be enough done, and skewer the sweetbread on the 
back side of the breast. When sufficiently roasted, take off 
the caul, baste it, and dredge a little flour over it. Pork 
should be well done, or it will otherwise be apt to surfeit. 
When you roast a loin, cut the skin across with a sharp knife, 
in order to make the crackling eat the better. When you 
roast a leg of pork, score it in the same manner as the loin, 
and stuff the knuckle part with sage and onion, and skewer it 
up. Put a little drawn gravy in the dish, and send it up with 
apple-sauce in a tureen. The spring, or hand of pork, if very 
young, and roasted like a pig, eats very well ; but, otherwise, 
it is much better boiled. The sparerib should be basted with 
a little butter, a very little dust of flour, and some sage and 
onions shred small. Apple sauce is the only sauce made for 
this joint. Wildfowls require a clear brisk fire, and should 
be roasted till they are of a light brown, but not too much ; 
for it is a great fault to roast them till the gravy runs out of 
fhem, as they thereby lose their fine flavour. Tame fowls 
require more roasting, as they are a long time before they get 
thoroughly heated. ' They should be often basted, in order to 
keep up a strong froth, and as it makes them of a finer colour, 
and rise better. Pigs and geese should be roasted before a 
good fire, and turned quickly. Hares and rabbits require time 
and care, to see the ends are roasted enough. In order to 
prevent their appearing bloody at the neck when they are 
cut up, cut the neck skin, when they are half roasted, and let 
out the blood. Having thus premised these general rules for 
roasting, we shall now proceed to particulars. 

A Fore Quarter of House Lamb. 

HOUSE lamb requires to be well roasted. A small fore- 
quarter will take an hour and a half; a leg, three quarters of 



no ASH:-. 

an hour. For sauce, mint sauce, with salad, brocoli, 
toes, celery raw or stewed : or for a fore quarter of lamb, cut 
off the shoulder, pepper and salt the ribs, and squeeze a Se- 
ville orange over it. 

Tongues or Udders. 

THE tongue should be parboiled, before it is put down to 
roast; stick eight or ten cloves about it; baste it with but- 
ter, and serve it up with some gravy. An udder may be 
roasted after the same manner. 

Sweetbreads. 

FIRST parboil them, and when cold lard them xvith bacou, 
and roast them in a Dutch oven, or on a poor man's jack. 
For sauce, plain butter, ketchup and butter, or lemon sauce. 

Venison. 

IN order to roast a haunch of venison properly, as soon ajs 
you have spitted it, you must lay over it a large sheet of pa- 
per, and then a thin common paste, with another paper over 
that. Tie it fast, in order to keep the paste from dropping oft'; 
and if the haunch be a large one, it will take four hours roast- 
ing. As soon as it is done enough, take off both paper and 
paste, dredge well with flour, and baste with butter. As soon 
as it becomes of a light brown, dish it up ; serving brown 
gravy, and currant jelly sauce, in tureens. 

Saddle of Mutton. 

TAKE a saddle, and remove the skin very neatly near the 
rump, without taking it quite off, or breaking it. Take some 
lean ham, truffles, morels, green onions, parsley, thyme, sweet 
herbs, all chopped small, with some spice, pepper, and salt* 
Strew it over the mutton where the skin is taken off; put the 
skin over it neatly, and tie over it some white paper, well 
buttered, and roast it. When nearly enough, take off the 
paper, strew over it some grated bread, and when it is of a fine 
brown, take it up. Have ready some good gravy for 'sauce. 
Or it may be roasted without any force. 

Haunch of Mutton. 

To dress a haunch of mutton venison fashion, take a hind 
fat quarter of mutton, and cut the leg like a haunch. Lay it 
in a pan with the back side of it down, and pour a bottle of 
red wine over it, in which let it lie twenty-four hours. Spit 
and roast it at a good quick fire, and keep basting all the time 
with the same liquor and butter. It will require an hour and 
an half roasting ; and when done, send it up with a little 



ROASTING. 39 

good gravy in one boat, and sweet sauce in another. A good 
i'at neck of mutton done in this manner, is esteemed delicate 
eating. 

Mutton with Oysters. 

TAKE a leg of mutton, after it has beeli killed two or three 
days, stuff it all over with oysters, and roast it. Garnish with 
horse-radish. It may be roasted with cockles in the same 
manner. 

Pigs. 

COOKS who choose to have the killing of the pig they are 
to dress, must proceed thus : stick the pig just above the 
breast-bone, and run the knife into its heart ; for if the heart 
is not touched, it will be a long while dying. As soon as it is 
dead, put it a few minutes in cold water, and rub it over with 
a little rosin, beaten exceedingly fine, or you may make use 
of its own blood for that purpose. Let it lie half a minute in 
a pail of scalding water, then take it out, lay it upon a clean 
table, and pull off the hair as fast as possible ; but if it do not 
come clean off, put it into the hot water again, and when per- 
fectly clean, wash it in warm water, and then in two or three 
cold waters, in order that in may not taste of the rosin, when 
dressed. Take off the four feet at the first joint, slit it down 
the belly, and take out all the entrails. Put the heart, liver, 
lights, and pettitoes together; wash the pig well in cold water, 
and having perfectly dried it, fold it in a wet cloth to keep it 
from the air. Make a stuffing with chopped sage, two escha- 
lots, two eggs, grated bread, and fresh butter; and season 
with pepper and salt : put it into the belly, sew it up, spit it, 
and rub it over with a paste-brush dipped in sweet oil. Roast 
gently, and when done, cut off the head ; 'then cut the body 
and head in halves, lay them on a dish, put the stuffing with 
the brains into a stewpan, add to them some good gravy, 
make it boil, and serve up the pig with the sauce under it. 
See Sauces. 

Hind Quarter of a Pig, Lamb fashion. 

AT that season of the year, when house lamb bears an ex- 
traordinary price, the hind quarter of a large pig will be a 
very good substitute for it. Take off the skin and roast it, 
and it will eat like lamb. Serve with mint sauce, or a salad. 

Ham or Gammon. 

TAKE off the skin of the ham or gammon, when you have 
half boiled it, and dredge with oatmeal sifted very fine. Baste 
with butter, and roast gently two hours. Stir up your fire, 



40 ROASTING. 

and then brown it quickly ; and when so done dish up, and 
pour brown gravy into the dish. 

Calfs Head. 

WASH the head very clean, take out the bones, and dry 
well with a cloth. Make a seasoning of beaten mace, white 
pepper aud salt, some bacon cut very small, and some grated 
bread. Strew this over it, roll it up, skewer it with a small 
skewer, and tie it with tape. Roast and baste it with butter ; 
make a rich veal-gravy, thickened with butter, and roll it in 
flour. Some like mushrooms and the fat part of oysters : but 
it is very good without. 

The German Way of dressing a Calf's Head. 

TAKE a large calf's head, with great part of the neck cut 
with it. Split it in half, scald it very white, and take out the 
jaw-bone. Take a large stewpati or saucepan, and lay at 
the bottom some slices of bacon, then some thin beef ste..ks, 
with some pepper and salt. Then lay in the head, pour in 
some beef stock, a large onion stuck with cloves, and a bunch 
of sweet herbs. Cover the stewpan very close, and set it over 
a stove to stew. Then make a ragout with a quart of good 
beef gravy, and half a pint of red wine. Let the wine be 
well boiled in the gravy ; add to it some sweetbreads par- 
boiled, and cut in slices, some cocksy-combs, oysters, mush- 
rooms, truffles, and morels. Let these stew till they be ten- 
der. When the head is stewed, take it up, put it into a dish, 
take out the brains, the eyes, and the bones. Then slit the 
tonue,cut it into small pieces, cut the eyes in pieces also, 
and chop the brains ; put these into a baking-dish, and pour 
some of the ragout over them. Then take the head, lay it 
upon the ragout, pour the rest over it, and on that some melted 
butter. Then scrape some fine Parmesan cheese, and *trew 
it over the butter, and send it to the oven. It does not want 
much baking, but only requires tabe of a fine brown. 

Calfs Liver. 

WASH and wipe it ; cut a long hole in it, and fill it up 
with a stuffing made of grated bread, chopped anchovy, sweet 
herbs, fat bacon shred fine, onion, salt, pepper, a bit of but- 
ter, and an egg: sew the liver up ; then lard it, or wrap it in 
a veal-caul, and roast it. Serve with good gravy, and sweet 
sauce. See Sauces. 

Stuffing for Turkeys, Hares, Rabbits, Veal, Kc. 

CHOP very fine, beef suet, parsley, thyme, eschalots, a very 
small quantity of marjorum ; savory, basil, and lemon peel. 



ROASTING. 41 

with grated nutmeg, two eggs (or milk), pepper, salt, and an 
anchovy ; mix all together, with grated bread. 

Green Geese. 

PUT a large lump of butter into the goose, spit it and lay 
it down to the fire. Singe it, dredge it with flour, and baste 
it well with butter. Baste it three or four different times with 
cold butter, which will make the flesh rise much better than 
if it were basted with the contents of the dripping-pan. If the 
goose be a large one, it must be kept to the fire three quar- 
ters of an hour; and when you think it is enough, dredge it 
with flour, baste it till a fine froth rises on it, and the goose 
be of a nice brown. See Sauces. 

Stubble Geese. 

TAKE a few sage leaves and two onions, and chop them as 
fine as possible. Mix them with a large piece of butter, two 
spoonfuls of salt and one of pepper. Put this into the goose, 
spit it, and lay it down to the fire. Singe it, and dust it with 
flour, and when it is thoroughly hot, baste it with fresh but- 
ter. A large goose will require an hour and a half before a 
good fire, and when it is done, dredge it and baste it, pull out 
the spit, and pour in a little boiling water. See Sauces. 

Chickens. 

PLUCK your chickens very carefully, d/aw them, and cut 
off their claws only, and truss them. Put them down to a 
good fire, singe, dust, and baste them with butter. A quarter 
of an hour w r ill roast them ; and when they are enough, froth 
them, and lay them on your dish. Serve up with parsley and 
butter, or white sauce. See Sauces. 

Fowls. 

HAVING cleansed and dressed your large fowls, put them 
down to a good fire, singe, dust, and baste them well with 
butter. They must be near an hour at the fire. Make your 
gravy of the necks and gizzards, and when you have strained 
it, put in a spoonful of browning. Take up your fowls, pom- 
some gravy into a dish, and serve them up with egg sauce. 
See Sauces. 

Pheasants. 

PHEASANTS and partridges may be treated in the same 
manner. Dust them with flour, and baste them often with 
fresh butter, keeping them at a good distance from the fire. 
A good fire will roast them in half an hour. Serve up with 
poivrade sauce, and bread sauce. See Sauces. 






Fowls, Pheasant fashion. 

IF you should have but one pheasant, and want two in a 
dish, take a large full-grown fowl, keep the head on, and 
truss it just as you do a pheasant. Lard it with bacon, but 
do not lard the pheasant, and no bt>dy will know it. 

Pigeons. 

SCALD, draw, and take the craws clean out of your pigeons. 
and wash them in several waters. When you have dried 
them, roll a good lump of butter in chopped parsley, and sea- 
son it with pepper and salt. Put this into your pigeons, and 
spit, dust, and baste them. A good fire will roast them in 
twenty minutes, and when they are enough, serve them up 
with parsley and butter. See Sauces. 

Larks. 

'SKEWER a dozen larks, and tie both ends of the skewer to 
the spit. Dredge and baste them, and let them roast ten 
minutes. Break half a penny loaf into crumbs, and put them, 
with a piece of butter about the size of a walnut, into a toss- 
ing pan, and having shaken them over a gentle fire till they 
are of a light brown, lay them between the birds, and pour a 
little melted butter over them. 

Larks roasted a la Francois. 

WHEN the larks are trussed, put a sage or vine leaf over 
their breasts: and having put them on a long skewer, put be- 
tween every lark a thin piece of bacon. Tie the skewer to 
the spit, and roast the birds before a clear brisk fire. Baste 
with butter, and on removing the leaves, strew on them some 
grated bread, mixed with a little flour. When neatly roasted, 
put the larks round a dish, with grated bread fried in butter, in 
the middle. 

Quails. 

'- : 

TRUSS the quails, and make a stuffing for them with beef 
suet and sweet herbs chopped very small, seasoned with a 
little spice. Put them upon a small spit, and when they grow 
warm baste them with water and salt ; then dredge them and 
baste them with butter. For sauce, dissolve an anchovy in 
good gravy, with two or three eschalots cut very fine, and the 
juice of a Seville orange. Lay some fried bread crumbs 
round the dish. See Sauces. 



ROASTING. 43 

Ducks. 

KILL and draw your ducks ; then shred an onion, and a 
few sage leaves. Season these with salt and pepper, and put 
them into your ducks. Singe, dust, and baste them with but- 
ter, and a good fire will roast them in twenty minutes; for the 
quicker they are done the better they will be. Before you 
take them up, dust them with flour, and baste them with but- 
ter to give them a good frothing, and a pleasing brown. 
Your gravy must be made of the gizzard and pinions, an 
onion, a tea-spoonful of lemon-pickle, a few pepper corns, 
and a large blade of mace, a spoonful of ketchup, and the 
same of browning. Strain it and pour into your dish. 

Turkeys. 

HAVING dressed your turkey, according to the preparatory 
directions already given for boiling it, truss its head down to 
the legs, and make your stuffing as before directed. Spit it, 
and lay it down to a good fire, which must be clear and brisk. 
Singe, dust it with flour, and baste it several times with cold 
butter, which will froth it much better than the hot contents 
of the dripping-pan, and make the turkey more plump. When 
properly done, renew the frothing in the same manner as be- 
fore, and dish up. A middling sized turkey must be down at 
the fire an hour and a quarter. See Sauces. 

Ruff's and Rees. 

THESE birds are said to be peculiar to Lincolnshire, being 
very rarely found in any other county. ' The properest food 
to give them is white bread and boiled milk, and they will be 
fat in about eight or ten days ; but they must be fed separate- 
ly, they being so delicate a bird, that they will riot both eat 
out of the same pot or trough. When you kill them, strip 
the skin off the head and neck, with the feathers on, and then 
pluck and draw them. Put them at a good distance from the 
fire in roasting, and they will be done enough in about twelve 
minutes, if the fire be good. When you take them up, slip 
the skin on again with the feathers on. Garnish the dish 
with crisp crumbs of bread round it, and send them up with 
gravy under them, such as is directed for the pheasant, and 
bread sauce in a boat. See Sauces. 

Rabbits. 

CASE your rabbits, skewer their heads with their mouths 
upon their backs, stick their fore legs into their ribs and 
ikewer the hind legs double. Use the stuffing before di- 



44> ROASTING. 

reeled. Put it into their bellies, sew them up, and dredge 
and baste them well with butter. Take them up when they 
have roasted an hour ; chop the livers, and lay them in lumps 
round the edge of your dish. Serve them up with parsley and 
butter for sauce. See Sauces. 

Rabbits dressed Hare Fashion. 

LARD your rabbit with bacon, and roast it in the manner 
of a hare. If you lard it, you must make gravy sauce ; but 
if it be not larded, white sauce will be most proper. See 
Sauces. 

Hares. 

HAVING skewered your hare with the head upon one 
shoulder, the fore legs stuck into the ribs, and the hind legs 
double,proced to make your stuffing as before directed. While 
roasting, dredge with flower, and baste with milk, and so 
alternately, till a quarter of an hour before the hare is done : 
then baste it with a quarter of a pound of fresh butter put 
into the dripping pan. Serve up with a cullis sauce, and cur- 
rant jelly. See Sauces. 

Woodcocks and Snipes. 

HAVING put your birds on a little spit, take a round of a 
threepenny loaf, and toast it brown ; lay it in a dish under the 
birds ; and when you lay them down to the fire, baste them 
with a little butter, and let the trail drop on the toast. When 
they be roasted enough, put the toast in the dish, and lay the 
birds on it. Pour about a quarter of a pint of gravy into the 
dish, and set it over a lamp or chafing-dish, for three or four 
minutes, when the whole will be in a proper condition to be 
sent to the table. Observe never to take any thing out of a 
woodcock or snipe. 

Eels and Lampreys. 

EELS and lampreys are roasted with puddings in their bel- 
lies in the same manner. Cut off their heads, gut them, and 
take off the blood from the bone as clean as possible. Make 
a forcemeat of shrimps or oysters, chopped small, half a 
penny loaf crumbled, a little lemon-peel shred fine, the yolks 
of two eggs, and a little salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Put this 
into the bellies of the fish, sew them up, and turn them round 
on the dish. Put flour and butter over them, pour a little 
water into the dish, and bake them in a-moderate oven. When 
vou take them out, take the gravy from under them, and 
skim off the fat, strain it through an hair sieve, and add to it 



BAKING. 45 

a tea-spoonful of lemon pickle, two of browning, a large 
spoonful of walnut ketchup, a glass of white wine, and an- 
chovy, and a slice of lemon. Let it boil ten minutes, and 
thicken it with butter and flour. Lemon and crisp parsley 
may serve as a garnish. 

Lobsters. 

Pi T T a skewer into the vent of the tail of the lobster, to pre- 
vent the water from getting into the body of it, and put it into 
a pan of boiling water, with a little salt in it, and if it be a 
large one, it will take half an hour boiling. Then lay it before 
the fire, and baste it with butter till it has a fine froth. Dish 
it up with plain melted butter io a boat. This is a better way 
than actually roasting them, and is not attended with hajf the 
trouble. 

Cod's Head. 

HAVING washed the head very clean, and scored it with 
a knife, strew a little salt on it, and lay it in a large tin oven 
before the fire. Throw away all the water that comes from 
it for the first half hour ; then sprinkle on a little nutmeg, 
cloves, mace beat fine,, and salt. Flour, and baste it with 
butter. When that has lain some time, turn and season it, 
and baste the other side the same. Turn it often, then baste 
it with butter and crumbs of bread. If it be a large head it 
will take four or five hours baking. Have ready some melted 
butter wi||um anchovy, some of the liver of the fish boiled 
and bruised fine, and mix it well with the butter, and two 
yolks of eggs beat fine. Then strain them through a sieve, and 
put them into the saucepan, with a few shrimps or pickled 
cockles, two spoonfuls of red wine, and the juice of a lemon ; 
serve up. 



CHAPTER V. 
BAKING. 

Leg of Beef. 

(_/UT the meat off a leg of beef, and break the bones; put 
it into an earthen pan, with two onions and a bundle of sweet 
herbs, and season it with a spoonful of whole pepper, and a 
few cloves and blades of mace. Cover it with water, and 
having tied the pot down close with brown paper, put it into 



BAKIN(;. 

the oven to bake. As soon as it is enough, take it out and 
strain it through a sieve, and pick out all the fat and sinews, 
putting thenvmto a saucepan, with a little gravy, and a piece 
of butter rolled in flour. Set the saucepan on the fire, shake 
it often, and when it is thoroughly hot, pour it into the dish.. 
and send it to table. Ox cheek' may be done in the same 
manner; and if you should think it too strong, you may 
weaken it by pouring in a suflicient quantity of hot \va?n . 
but cold water will spoil it. 

Rump of Beef . 

TAKE a rump of beef and bone it, beat it well with a roll- 
ing pin, cut off the sinew, and lard it with a large piece of 
bacon. Season your lards with pepper, salt, and cloves : and 
lard across the meat, that it may cut handsomely. Season 
every part of the meat with pepper, salt, and cloves; put them 
in an earthen pot, with all the broken bones, half a pound of 
butter, some bay leaves, some whole pepper, one or two sha- 
lots, and some sweet herbs. Cover the top of the pan well ; 
then put it in an oven ; and let it stand eight hours. Serve' it 
up with some dried sippits, and its own liquor. 

Calf's Head. 

TAKE a calf's head, and pick and wash it very clean. Get 
an earthen dish large enough to hold the head, and rub the 
inside of the dish with butter. Lay some long iron skewers 
across the top of the dish, and lay the head on them. Skewer 
up the meat in the middle, that it may not touch the dish, 
and then grate some nutmeg on every part of it, a few sweet 
herbs, shred small, some crumbs of bread, and a little lemon- 
peel cut fine. Then flour it all over, and having stuck pieces 
of butter in the eyes, and on different parts of the head, 
flour it again. Let it be well baked, of a fine brown. You may- 
throw a little pepper and salt over it, and put into the dish a 
piece of beef cut small, a bundle of sweet herbs, an onion, a 
blade of mace, some whole pepper, two cloves, a pint of water, 
and boil the brains with some sage. When the head is 
enough, lay it on a dish, and put it before the fire to keep 
warm ; then stir all together in the dish, and put it in a sauce- 
pan ; then strain it off, and put it into the saucepan again. 
Put into it a piece of butter rolled in flour, the sage and the 
brains chopped fine, a spoonful of ketchup, and two spoon- 
fpjs of red wine. Boil them together, take the brains, beat 
f*iem well, and mix them with the sauce. Pour all into the 
dish, and send it to table. The tongue must be baked in the 
head, and not cut out, as the head will then lie in the dish 
more handsomely. 



BAKING. 1 

Pigs. 

WHEN necessity obliges you to bake a pig, lay it in a dish, 
tlour it well all over, and rub the pig over with butter. But- 
ter the dish in which you intend to put it, and put it in the 
oven. Take it out as soon as it is enough; and having rub- 
bed it over with a butter cloth, put it into the oven again till 
it be dry ; then take it out, lay it in a dish, and cut it up. 
Take off* the fat from the dish it was baked in, and some 
good gravy will remain at the bottom. Add to this a litrie 
veal gravy, with a piece of butter rolled in flour, and boil it 
up ; put it into the dish, with the brains and sage in the 
belly. 

Salmon. 

CUT a piece of salmon in slices of an inch thick, and make 
forcemeat as follows : take some of the flesh of the salmon, 
and the same quantity of the meat of an eel, with a few mush- 
rooms. Season with pepper, salt, nutmeg, and cloves. Beat 
all together till very fine. Boil the crumb of a halfpenny roll 
in milk, beat it with four eggs till it be thick, then let it cool, 
and mix it. all together with four raw eggs. Take the skin 
from the salmon, and lay the slices in a dish. Cover every 
slice with forced meat, pour some melted butter over them, 
and add a few crumbs of bread. Lay a crust round the dish, 
and stick oysters round it. Put it into an oven, and, when it is 
of a fine brown, pour over it a little melted butter, with some 
red wine boiled in it, and the juice of a lemon. 

Carp. 

HAVING scaled, washed, and cleaned a brace of carp pro- 
perly, get an earthen pan deep enough for them to lie in 
properly ; and having buttered the pan a little, lay in the 
carp. Season them with a little black and white pepper, mace, 
cloves, nutmegs, a bundle of sweet herbs, an onion, and an 
anchovy ; pour in a bottle of white wine, cover them close, 
and put them into a hot oven. If they are large, they will 
require an hour baking ; but if small, less time will do 
them. When they are enough, take them up carefully, and 
lay them in a dish. Set it over hot water to keep hot, and 
cover close. Pour all the liquor in which they were baked 
into a saucepan ; let it boil a minute or two, strain it, and 
add half a pound of butter rolled in flour. Keep stirring '*+ 
all the time it is boiling ; squeeze in the juice of half a lemc.i, 
and put in a proper quantity of salt, observing to skim all the 
fat off" the liquor. Pour the sauce over the fish, lay the roes 
round them, and garnish with lemon. 



48 BAKING. 

| 

Cod's Head. 

MAKE the head very clean, and lay it in the pan, which 
you must first rub round with butter. Put in a bundle of 
sweet herbs, an onion stuck with cloves, three or four blades 
of mace, half a large spoonful of black and white pepper, 
part of a nutmeg bruised, a quart of water, a little piece of 
lemon-peel, and a little piece of horse-radish. Dust the head 
with flour, stick a piece of butter on various parts of it, and 
sprinkle raspings all over it, put it into the oven, and when 
enough, take it out of the dish, and lay it carefully in the 
dish in which you intend to serve it up. Set the dish over 
boiling water, and cover it up close, to prevent its getting 
cold. In the meantime, as expeditiously as you can, pour all 
the liquor out of the dish, in which it was baked, into a sauce- 
pan, and let it boil three or four minutes; then strain it, and 
put in a gill of red wine, two spoonfuls of ketchup, a pint of 
shrimps, half a pint of oysters, a spoonful of mushroom 
pickle, a quarter of a pound of butter rolled in flour, and stir 
all together till it be thick and boils : then strain it, and pour 
it into the dish, and have ready some toast, cut three corner 
ways, and fried crisp. Stick pieces of the toast about the 
head and mouth, and lay the remainder round the head. 

Herrings. 

HAVING scaled, washed, and dried your herrings properly,, 
lay them on a board, and take a little black pepper whole, 
allspice in fine powder, a few whole cloves, and plenty of salt ; 
mix them together, and rub the fish all over with it. Lay 
them in a pot, cover them with half vinegar and half small 
beer, tie a strong paper over the pot, and bake them in a 
moderate oven. .They may be eaten either hot or cold, and 
they will keep good two or three months. 

Sprats. 

MAY be dressed in the same manner, only they should be 
slightly rubbed with saltpetre the preceding night ; in order 
to make them red. 



BROILING. 49 



CHAPTER VI. 



BROILING. 

PRELIMINARY HINTS AND OBSERVATIONS. 

JJEFORE you lay your meat on the gridiron, be careful 
that your fire be very clear: the kind or cinder termed coak 
makes the best fire for broiling. Let your gridiron be very 
clean, and when heated by the fire, rub the bars with clean 
mutton suet: this will both prevent the meat from being dis- 
coloured, and hinder it from sticking. Turn your meat 
quickly while broiling, and have a dish, placed on a chafing- 
dish of hot coals, to put your meat in as fast as it is ready, 
and carry it hot and covered to table. Observe never to baste 
any thing on the gridiron, because that may be the means of 
burning it, and making it smoky. 

Beef Steaks. 

THE best beef steaks are those cut off a rump, and should 
not be more than half an inch in thickness. Lay on the 
steaks, and turn them often to keep in the gravy; or, having 
put them on the gridiron, keep them continually turning; 
whilst dressing, lay upon them a piece of fat ; and when 
taken from the fire, put upon them a little grated horse-radish, 
together with a small portion of butter, mixed with white 
pepper and salt. Put into the dish a little hot gravy, in which 
let there be shred some eschalot, or young onions, 

Mutton Chops. 

TAKE a loin of mutton, and cut chops from it about half an 
inch thick, and cut off the skin, and part of the fat. Keep 
turning them often, and take care that the fat which fulls from 
them do not make the fire blaze and smoke your chops. Put 
them into a dish as soon as you think they are done, and rub 
them with butter. Slice an eschalot very thin into a spoonful 
of water, and pour it on them with a spoonful of mushroom 
ketchup, and a little salt. Or cut the best part of a neck of 
mutton into chops, having previously cut off the fat, and sea- 
son them with white pepper and sak : keep frequently turning 
them. When sufficiently done, serve them up as hot as pos- 
sible. 



M> BROILING, 

Pork Chops. 

THE same rules we have laid down for broiling mutton, 
will hold good with respect to pork chops, with this difference 
only, that pork requires more broiling than mutton. As soon 
as they are enough, put a little good gravy to them, and 
strew a little sage, rubbed fine, over them, which will give- 
them an agreeable flavour. 

Chickens, 

HAVING slitted your chickens down the back, season them 
with pepper and salt, and lay them on the gridiron, over a 
clear fire, and at a great distance. Let the inside continue 
next the fire, till it be nearly half done. Then turn them, 
taking care that the fleshy sides do not burn, and let them 
broil till they are of a fine brown. Have good gravy sauce, 
with some mushrooms, and garnish them with lemon, and 
the liver broiled, and the gizzards cut, slashed, and broiled 
with pepper and salt. See Sauces, 

Pigeons. 

WHEN you broil pigeons, take care that your fire be clear. 
Take some parsley shred fine, a piece of butter as big as a 
walnut, with a little pepper and salt, and put it into their 
bellies. Tie them at both ends, and put them on the grid- 
iron. Or you may split and broil them, having first seasoned 
them with pepper and salt. Serve them up with a little parsley 
and butter. 

Broiled Fish prepared thus : 

WIPE the fish dry, flour them well, and have the gridiron 
clean ; then rub the bars with a veal caul, and put the fish at 
a proper distance. Broil them gently over a clear fire till of 
a fine colour, and serve them up directly. Fish in general to 
be floured, except herrings, which are only to be scored with 
a knife. 

Weavers. 

GUT, and wash clean; dry in a clean cloth, and flour; 
then broil them. Serve with plain butter and anchovy sauce, 
See Sauces. 

Cod. 

CUT the cod into slices about two inches thick, and dry 
*nd flour them well. Make a good clear fire, rub the grid- 



BftOlLlNG. 51 

iron with a piece of chalk, and set it high from the fire. 
Turn them often, till they be quite enough, and of a fine 
hrovvn. They require a great deal of care to prevent them 
from breaking. Lobster or shrimp sauce. See Sauces. 

Crimped Cod. 

PUT a gallon of pump water into a pot, and set it on the 
fire, with a handful of salt. Boil it up several times, and 
keep it clean scummed. When well cleared from the scum, 
take a middling cod, as fresh as possible, and throw it into a 
tub of fresh pump water. Let it lie a few minutes, and then 
cut it into slices two inches thick. Throw these into the 
boiling brine, and let it boil briskly a few minutes. Then 
take out the slices, take great care not to break them, and lay 
them on a sieve to drain. When they are well dried, flour 
them, and lay them at a distance upon a very good fire to 
broil. Lobster or shrimp sauces. See Sauces. 

Trout. 

CLEAN and wash, and dry them well in a cloth ; tie theni 
round with packthread from top to bottom, to keep them entire 
and in shape. Then melt some butter, with a good deal of 
basket salt. Pour it all over the trout till it is perfectly covered ; 
then put it on a clear fire, at a great distance, that it may do 
gradually. When done, lay it in a warm dish, and serve with 
anchovy sauce. 

Cod Sounds. 

LAY them a few minutes in hot water, then take them out, 
and rub them well with salt, and take off the skin and black 
dirt. Put them into water, and boil till tender. Take them 
out, flour them well, pepper and salt them, and then put 
them on the gridiron. Whilst broiling, season a little good 
brown gravy with pepper, salt, a tea spoonful of soy, and a 
little mustard : give it a boil with a bit of flour and butter, 
and pour it over the sounds. 

Lobsters. 

WHEN the lobsters are broiled, split their tails and chines, 
crack their claws, and pepper and salt them. Take out their 
bodies, and what is called the lady. Then put them again 
into the shel!s, and then upon the gridiron over a clear fire, 
as also the tails and the claws. Baste them with butter, and 
send them to table, with melted butter and anchovy sauce. 

Mackerel. 
HAVING cleaned your mackerel, wipe dry , split them down the 



$2 BROILING. 

back, and season them with pepper and salt. Flour them, 
and broil them of a fine light brown. See Sauces. 

If you choose to broil your mackerel whole, wash them 
clean, cut off their heads, and pull out their roes at the neck 
end. Boil their roes in a little water; then bruise them with 
a spoon, beat up the yolk of an egg, a little nutmeg, a little 
lemon peel cut fine, some thyme, some parsley, boiled and 
chopped fine, a little salt and pepper, and a few crumbs of 
bread. Mix these well together, and fill the fish with them. 
Flour them well, and broil^ them nicely. Butter, ketchup, 
and walnut pickle, will make a proper sauce. 

Salmon. 

TAKE pieces or slices of salmon, wipe dry, dip in sweet 
oil (or for want of oil, in fres'i butter that has been oiled), 
and season with pepper and salt; fold them in pieces of 
writing paper, broil over a clear fire, and serve them up hot. 

Eels. 

. HAVING skinnedj gutted, and washed your eels, dry them 
with a cloth, and rub them with the yolk of an egg. Strew 
grated bread over them and chopped parsley, and sea- 
son them with pepper and salt. Baste them well with butter, 
and broil them on a gridiron. Serve with parsley and butter, 
and anchovy sauce. 

Eels pitch-cocked. 

HAVING skinned and cleansed your eels as before, sprinkle 
them with pepper, salt, and a little dried sage. Turn them 
backward and forward, and skewer them. Rub your gridiron 
with beef suet, and broil them till they are of a fine brown. 
Put them on your dish, serve them up with melted butter, 
and lay fried parsley round the dish. 

Haddocks and Whitings. 

HAVING gutted and washed your fish, dry them with a 
cloth, and rub a little vinegar over them, which will contri- 
bute to preserve the skin whole. Dredge them well with 
flour, and rub your gridiron with beef suet. Let your grid- 
iron he very hot when you lay your fish on, otherwise they 
will stick to it. Turn them two or three times while they 
are broiling, and when enough, serve up with melted butter 
and anchovy sauce. 

Another method is, when you have cleansed and dried your 
fish as before directed, put them in a tin oven, and set them 
before a quick fire. Take them from the fire as soon as the 
skin begins to rise, and having beaten up an egg, rub it over 



BROILING. 53 

them with a feather. Sprinkle a few crumbs of bread over 
them, dredge them well with flour, and rub your gridiron 
when hot with suet or butter ; but it must be very hot before 
you lay your fish on it. When you have turned them, rub a 
little butter over them, and keep turning them as the fire may 
require, till they be enough, which may be known by their 
browning. Serve them up with either shrimp sauce, or melted 
butter and anchovy sauce. 

Mullets. 
ARE to be dressed as directed for salmon. 

Herrings. 

SCALE, gut, and wash clean, dry in a cloth ; score, and 
broil them. Plain butter and mustard for sauce. 

Potatoes. 

HAVING first boiled them, peel them, cut them into two, 
and broil them till they are brown on both sides. Then lay 
them in the plate or dish, and pour melted butter over them. 

Mushrooms. 

CLEAN fresh mushrooms with a knife, wash and drain them : 
make a case with a sheet of white paper ; rub the inside well 
with fresh butter, and fill it with the mushrooms ; season them 
with white pepper arid salt ; put the case containing them 
upon a baking plate of cast iron (in the country called a back- 
stone) over a slow fire ; cover them with the cover of a stew- 
pot, upon which place some fire, and when nearly dry, serve 
them up, with some rich cullis. See Sauces. 

Eggs. 

HAVING cut a toast round a quartern loaf, brown it, lay it 
on your dish, butter it, and very carefully break six or eight 
eggs on the toast. Take a red hot shovel, and hotd it over 
them. When done, squeeze & Seville orange over them, 
grate a little nutmeg over it, and serve it up for a side-plate. 
Or you may poach your eggs, and lay them on a toast; or 
toast your bread crisp, and pour a little boiling water over 
it. Season it with a little salt, and then lay your poached 
eggs on it. 



54 FRYING. 



CHAPTER VII. 
FRYING. 

PRELIMINARY HINTS AND OBSERVATIONS. 

JJE careful always to keep your frying-pan clean, and see 
that it is properly tinned. When you fry any sort of fish, 
first dry them in 'a cloth, and then flour them. Put into 
your frying-pan plenty of dripping or hog's lard, and let it be 
boiling hot before you put in your fish. Butter is not so good 
for the purpose, as it is apt to burn and blacken the fish, and 
make them soft. When you have fried your fish, lay them 
in a dish or hair sieve to drain, before you send them up to 
table. 

Venison. 

BONE your venison, if it be either the neck or breast ; but 
if it be the shoulder, the meat must be cut off the bone in 
slices. Make some gravy with the bones ; then take the meat 
and fry it of a light brown ; take it up and keep it hot before 
the fire. Put some flour to the butter in the pan, and keep 
stirring it till it be quite thick and brown. Take care it does 
r^ot burn. Stir in half a pound of fine sugar beat to powder, 
pfit in the gravy that came from the bones, and some red 
wine. Make it the thickness of a fine cream ; squeeze in the 
juice of a lemon, warm the venison in it, put it in the dish, 
and pour the sauce over it. 

Ox Feet. 

LET them boil till they are tender ; then skin and split 
them, and take out the bones, and fry them in butter. When 
they have fried a little, put in some mint and parsley shred 
small, a little salt, and some beaten butter; beat the yolks of 
eggs, some mutton gravy and vinegar, the juice of a lemon 
or orange, sind nutmeg. Lay it in the dish, and pour the 
sauce over it. Some put a little shred onion in it. 

Beef Steaks. 

HAVING cut your steaks in the same manner as for broiling, 
put them into a stewpan, with a good piece of butter, set 
them over a very slow fire, and keep turning them till the 
butter becomes of the consistence of white gravy. Pour it 
into a bason, and add more butter to them. When they are 
Dearly fried, pour all the gravy into a bason, and put more 



FRYING. 5 

butter in your pan. Fry your steaks over a brisk fire till they 
are of a light brown, and then take them out of the pan. 
Put them into a pewter dish made hot, slice a eschalot among 
them, andput in some of the gravy that was drawn from- them, 
and pour it hot upon them. 

Another method is, take rump-steaks, pepper and salt 
them, and fry them in a little butter very quick, and brown : 
then put them into a dish, and pour the fat out of the frying- 
pan. Take half a pint of hot gravy, half a pint of hot water, 
and pu: into the pan. Add to it a little butter rolled in flour, 
a little pepper and salt, and two or three eschalots chopped 
fine. Boil them up in your pan for two minutes, and pour it 
over the steaks You may garnish with a little scraped horse- 
radish. Or fry the steaks in butter a good brown, then put 
in half a pint of water, one onion sliced, a spoonful of walnut 
ketchup, a little chopped eschalot, and some white pepper and 
salt. When enough, thicken the gravy with flour and butter, 
and serve up very hot. 

Loin or Neck of Lamb. 

HAVING cut your lamb into chops, rub both sides of them 
with the yolk of an egg, and sprinkle some grated bread ovei 
them, mixed with a little parsley, thyme, marjoram, winter 
savory, and a little lemon-peel, all chopped very fine. Fry 
in butter till of a nice light brown, and garnish with fried 
parsley. 

Veal Cutlets. 

CUT your veal into pieces about the thickness of half a 
crown, and as long as you please. Dip them in the yolk of 
an egg, and strew over them grated bread, a few sweet 
herbs, some lemon-peel, and a little grated nutmeg, and fry 
them in fresh butter. While they are frying, make a little 
gravy, and when the meat is done, take it out, and lay it in 
a dish before the fire ; then shake a little flour into the pan, 
and stir it round. Put in a little gravy and pickled mushrooms^ 
squeeze in a little lemon, and pour it over the veal. 

Cold Veal 

CUT your veal into pieces of the thickness of half a crown, 
and as long as you please. Dip them in the yolk of an egg, 
and then in grated bread, with a few sweet herbs, and shred 
lemon-peel in it. Grate a little nutmeg over them, and fry 
them in fresh butter. The butter must be hot, just enough 
to fry them in. In the meantime, make a little gravy of the 
bone of the veal, and when the meat is fried, take it omt 
with a fork, and lay it in a dish before the fire. Then shake 



5(5 FRYING. 

a little flour into the pan, and stir it round. Then put in a 
little gravy, squeeze in a little lemon, and pour it over the 
veal 4 

Sweetbreads. 

CUT them into long slices, beat up the yolk of an egg, and 
rub it over them with a feather. Make a seasoning of pepper, 
salt, and grated bread; dip them into it, and fry in butter; 
or you mny fry them in the following batter. For sauce, 
ketchup and butter, with gravy or lemon sauce. Garnish 
with small slices of toasted bacon and crisped parsley. See 
Sauces. 

Batter for frying different Articles ; such as Celery, OxPeths, 
Sweetbreads, Artichoke Bottoms, Tripe, Eggs, Me. 

TAKE four ounces of best flour sifted, a little salt and pep- 
per, three eggs, and a gill of beer; beat them together with 
a wooden sypoon for ten minutes. Let it be of a good thick- 
ness to adhere to the different articles. 

Tripe. 

CUT your tripe into pieces four inches long, and about 
three inches wide ; put it into batter, and fry in boiling lard. 
Fry till brown ; then take it out, and put it to drain, and serve 
it up with plain butter in a boat: or you may add fried 
onions, and serve up with butter and mustard. 

Sausages. 

TAKE six apples, and slice four of them as thick as a crown 
piece ; cut the other two in quarters, and fry them with the 
sausages till they are brown. Lay the sausages in the middle 
of the dish, and the apples round them. Garnish with the 
quartered apples. Sausages fried, and stewed cabbage, 
make a good dish. Heat cold pease-pudding in a pan, lay it 
in the dish, and the sausages round ; heap the pudding in 
'the middle, and lay the sausages all round up edgeways, ex- 
cept one in the middle at length. 

Eggs. 

PUT clarified butter in a frying-pan, break fresh eggs, one 
at a time ; put a little white pepper and salt, and turn them 
half over. They should be fried of a nice brown, but not 

11 

hard. 

Potatoes. 
CUT your potatoes into thin slices, as large as a crown piece, 



FRYING. 51 

and fry them brown. Lay them in a dish or plate, and pour 
melted butter over them. 

Artichokes. 

HAVING blanched them in water, flour them and fry them 
in fresh butter. Lay them in your dish, and pour melted 
butter over them. 

Celery. 

CUT celery heads throe inches long, boil them till half 
done, wipe dry, and dip in batter: have read^ boiling lard, 
take out the heads singly with a fork, fry them of a light co- 
lour, drain dry, and serve with fried parsley. 

Parsley. 

TAKE fresh gathered parsley, pick, wash, and drain it very 
dry with a cloth : have ready clean boiling lard, put the parsley 
into it, keep stirring with a skimmer, and. when a little crisp, 
take it out, put it on a drainer, and strew salt upon it. 

Turbots. 

THE turbot must be small ; cut it across as if it were ribbed; 
when it is quite dry, flour it, and put it in a large frying-pan, 
with boiling lard enough to cover it. Fry it till it is brown, 
and then drain it. Clean the pan, put into it half a pint of 
white wine, and white gravy enough to cover it, anchovy, 
salt, nutmeg, and a little ginger. Put in the fish, and let it 
stew till half the liquor is wasted. Then take it out, and put 
in a piece of butter rolled in flour, and a squeeze of lemon. 
Let them simmer till of a proper thickness ; rub a hot dish 
with a piece of eschalot, lay the turbot in the dish, and pour 
the hot sauce over it. 

Soles. 

HAVING skinned your soles in the same manner you do 
eels, except taking off their heads, which must not be done, 
rub them over with an egg, and strew over them grated bread. 
Fry them over a brisk fire in hog's lard till they are brown. 
Serve them up with melted butter, and anchovy sauce. 

Smelts. 

DRAW the guts out at the gills, but leave in the milt or 
roe ; dry them with a cloth, beat an egg, rub it over them 
with a feather, and strew grated bread over them. Fry them 
with ho^'s lard, and put in your fish when boiling hot. Shake 
them a little, and fry them till they are of a fine brown. 



A8 TRYING. 

Drain them on a dish, or in a sieve. Fry a handful of parsley 
in the manner already directed. 

Oysters, 

WHEN you intend to fry your oysters, you must always 
choose those of the larger kind. Open twenty-four large oys- 
ters, blanch them with their own liquor ; and when three parts 
done, strain them, and preserve the liquor ; then wash, and 
let them drain : in the meanwhile, make a batter with four 
table-spoonfuls of Hour, two eggs a little pepper and salt, and 
their liquor. Beat it well with a wooden spoon for five mi- 
nutes. Put the oysters into the batter, mix them lightly, and 
have ready boiling lard. Take the oysters out singly with a 
fork, put them into the lard, and fry them of a nice brown co- 
lour. Then put them on a drainer, strew over a small quantity 
of salt, and serve them up. If intended for a dish, put fried 
parsley under them, or stewed spinach. 

Carp. 

SCALE and gut your carp, then wash them clean, lay them 
in a cloth to dry, flour them, and fry them of a fine light 
brown. Take some crusts, cut tnree-corner ways, and fry 
them and the roes.. When your fish are done, lay them on a 
coarse cloth to drain, and prepare anchovy sauce, with the 
juice of lemon. Lay your carp on the dish, the roes on each 
side, and garnish with lemon and the fried toast. 

Tench. 

CLEAN your fish, slit them along the backs, and with the 
point of your knife raise the flesh from the bone. Cut the 
skin across at the head and tail, strip it off, and take out the 
bone. Take another tench, and mince the flesh small, with 
mushrooms, cives, and parsley. Season them with salt, pep- 
per, beaten mace, nutmeg, and a few savory herbs, minced 
small. Mix these well together, pound them in a mortar 
with crumbs of bread (in quantity about the size of two eggs) 
soaked in cream, the yolks of three or four eggs, and a piece 
of butter. When these have been well pounded, stuff your 
fish with it. Put clarified butter into a pan, set it over the 
fire, and when hot, flour your fish, and put them into the 
pan one by one. Having fried them till brown, take them 
up and lay in a coarse cloth before the fire to keep hot. 
Then pour all the fat out of the pan, put in a quarter of a 
pound of butter, and shake some flour into the pan. Keep 
it stirring with a spoon till the butter is a little brown, and 
then pour in half a pint of white wine. Stir them together, 



FRYING. 59 

and pour in half a pint of boiling water, an onion stuck. with 
cloves, a bundle of sweet herbs, and two blades of mace. 
Cover these close, and let them stew as softly as you can for 
a quarter of an hour ; then strain off the liquor, and put it 
into the pan again, adding two spoonfuls of ketchup, an 
ounce of truffles or morels, boiled tender in half a pint of 
water, a few mushrooms, and half a pint of oysters, clean 
washed in their own liquor. When you find your sauce 
is properly heated, and very good, put your tench into 
the pan, and make them quite hot ; then take them out, lay 
them into the dish, and pour your sauce over them. Carp 
may be dressed in the same manner, as may tench in the man- 
ner above described for carp. 

Eels. 

MAKE your eels very clean, cut them into pieces, and hav- 
ing seasoned them with pepper and salt, flour them and fry 
them. Let your sauce be plain melted butter and anchovy 
sauce ; but be careful to drain them properly before you lay 
them in the dish. 

Lampreys. 

BLEED them, and save the blood ; wash them in hot water 
to take off the slime, and cut them in pieces. When nearly 
fried enough, pour out the fat, put in a little white wine, and 
give the pan a shake round. Season with pepper, sweet 
herbs, a few capers, a good piece of butter rolled in flour, 
and the blood. Shake the pan often, and cover close. Take 
them out as soon as enough, strain the sauce, and give it a 
quick boil. Then squeeze in a lemon, and pour it over the 
fish. 

Mullets. 

SCALE and gut them ; melt some butter, and pour it into a 
deep dish. Score the mullets across the back, and dip them 
into the butter. Then set on in a stewpan some butter, and 
let it clarify. Fry the mullets in it, and when they are 
enough, lay them on a warm dish. For sauce, anchovy and 
butter. 

Herrings. 

HAVING scaled, washed, and dried your herrings properly, 
lay them separately on a board, and place them at the fire two or 
three minutes before they are wanted, which will prevent their 
sticking to the pan. Dredge your fish with flour ; and when 
your butter boils in the pan, put in your fish, a few at a time, 
and fry them over a brisk fire. As soon as sufficiently fried, 



60 STEWS AND HASHES. 

set their tails up one against another in the middle of the dish, 
and fry a large handful of parsley crisp ; take it out before 
it loses its colour, lay it round them, and serve them up with 
parsley sauce in a boa.t. Some fry onions, lay them round 
the dish, and make onion sauce ; and others cut off the heads 
of the herrings after they are fried, chop them, and put them 
into a saucepan, with ale, pepper, 'salt, and an anchovy; 
they then thicken it with flour and butter, strain it, and put 
it into a sauce-boat. 



CE1APTER VIII. 



STEWS AND HASHES 






*.j Tiivmp of Beef. 

IN order to stew rump of beef property, you- must first half 
roast it, and then put it into a large saucepan, with two 
quarts of water, one pint of small beer, one pint of red wine, 
two or three blades of mace, an eschalot, two spoonfuls of 
walnut ketchup, one of lemon pickle, two of browning, and 
a little cayenne pepper and salt. Let these stew over a gentle 
fu-^fror two hours, closely covered ; then take out your beef, 
and lay it on a deep dish, skim off the fat, and strain the 
gravy. Put into it an ounce of morels, half a pint of musli- 
roor^s, and thicken your gravy, and pour it over your beef. 
Lay 'forcemeat balls round it. Or wash the beef well, season 
high with pepper, cayenne, allspice, three cloves, and a blade 
of mace, all in fine powder. Bind up tight, and lay in a pot 
that will just hold it. Fry three large onions sliced, put them 
to it, with three carrots, two turnips, an eschalot, four cloves, 
a blade of mace, a bundle of sweet herbs, and some celery. 
Cover the meat with beef broth : simmer as gently as pos- 
sible till tender. Clear off the fat, .and add to the gravy half 
a pint of port wine, a glass of vinegar, two spoonfuls of 
ketchup; simmer for half an hour, and serve in a deep dish. 

Brisket of Beef a La Francois, 

BONE a brisket of beef, and season with sweet herbs, escha- 
lots, beaten spides, pepper, and salt: bind it round with a 
packthread, and add beef gravy one quart, port wine one 
pint, walnut ketchup four spoonfuls; braise (stew gently) till 
tender; wipe the top dry, glaize, and serve it up with the 



STEWS AND HASHES. 61 

gravy round. Either onion, savoy, haricof, or ashee sauces 
may be used. For making glaize, &c. See Sauces. 

Brisket of Beef a L'Anglois. 

STEW in two gallons of water, for two or three hours over 
night, about ten pounds of brisket of beef. When sufficiently 
tender, take out the bones. Then boil in some of the liquor a 
few carrots, turnips, onions, celery, and white cabbage, till they 
become quite tender. Add these and some salt and a liftle 
pepper to the beef, and remainder of the broth, and stew all 
together till sufficiently done. 

Beef Gobbets. 

CUT any piece of beef, except the leg, into pieces about 
the size or a pullet's egg, and put them into a stewpan. Cover 
with water, stew, skim clean, and when they have stewed an 
hour, take mace, cloves, and whole pepper, tigd loosely in 
a muslin rag, and some celery cut small. Put them into 
the pan with some salt, turnips and carrots pared, and cut in 
slices, a little parsley, a bundle of sweet herbs, and a large 
crust of bread. You may put in an ounce of barley or rice, 
if you like it. Cover it close, and let it stew till tender. 
Take out the herbs, spices, and bread, and have ready a 
French roll cut in four. Dish up all together, and send it to 
table. 

Beef stewed savourily. 

CUT out the inside of a sirloin of beef, and take from it all 
the fat; prepare a sufficient quantity of rich forcemeat (see 
Sauces J, and put it within the beef, which must be tightly 
rolled and bound with a tape. Fry to a light brown, and after 
suffering the fat to drain from it, put it into a stewpan with a 
quart of good gravy, a little ketchup, anchovy liquor, and 
a few oysters, if in season. 

Beef Steaks. 

HAVING procured rump steaks, cut thick for this purpose, 
pepper and salt them, and lay them in a stewpan, with some 
butter and a little water ; when brown, add half a pint of 
water, a blade or two of mace, two or three cloves, an an- 
chovy, a small bundle of sweet herbs, a piece of butter rolled 
in flour, a glass of white wine, and an onion. Cover close, 
and let them stew softly till tender; then take out the steaks, 
and pour off all the fat. Then strain the sauce they were 
stewed in, and pour it into the pan, add a glassful of port 
wine, and toss it all up together, till the sauce be quite hot 



C2 STEWS AND HASHES. 

and thick ; and if you choose to enrich it, von may add a

Lamb's Head. 

IN order to stew a lamb's head, wash and pick it very clean. 
Lay it in water for an hour, take out the brains, and with a 
sharp knife carefully extract the bones and the tongue ; but 
be careful to avoid breaking the meat. Then take out the 
eyes. Take two pounds of veal and two pounds of beef 
suet, a very little thyme, a good piece of lemon peel minced, 
part of a nutmeg grated, and two anchovies. Having chop- 
ped all these well together, grate two stale rolls, and mix all 
with the yolks of four eggs. Save enough of this meat to 
make about twenty balls. Take half a pint of fresh mush- 
rooms, clean peeled and washed, the yolks of six eggs chop- 
ped, half a pint of oysters clean washed, or pickled cockles. 
Mix all together; but first stew your oysters, and put to them 
two quarts of gravy, with a blade or two of mace. Tie the 
head with packthread, cover it close, and let it stew two hours. 
While this is doing, beat up the brains with some lemon-peel 
cut fine, a little chopped parsley, a little grated nutmeg, and 
the yolk of an egg. Fry the brains in little cakes, in boiling 
dripping, and fry the balls, and keep them both hot. Take 
half an ounce of truffles and morels, and strain the gravy the 
head was stewed in. Put td it the truffles and morels, and a 
few mushrooms, and boil all together ; then put in the rest 
of the brains that are not fried, and stew them together for a 
minute or two. Pour this over the head, lay the fried brains 
and balls round it, and garnish with lemon.

with a little flour, and let it stew for a quarter of an hour in a 
rich white gravy made of veal and mutton, a piece of bacon, 
and seasoned with white pepper and salt, onion, and a very 
little mace. Take off the meat from the other half of the hvjad 
in one whole piece, and roll it like a collar, having previously 
stuffed it with a rich forcemeat (see Sauces), and bind with a 
tape. Stew till tender in good gravy: when done enough,

pan close, and let it stand an hour and a half over a stove. 
Put a gill of white wine into a saucepan, with an onion, two 
anchovies chopped fine, a quarter of a pound of butter rolled 
in flour, a little lemon peel, and half a pint of veal gravy. 
Having boiled them a few minutes, add the yolks of two eggs, 
mixed with a little cream, and when it boils, squeeze in the 
uice of half a lemon. Pour this hot upon the fish, and serve 
^thern up. 

Barbd. 

TAKE a large barbel, scale, gut, and wash it in vinegar and 
salt, and afterwards in water. Put it into a stewpan, with eel 



74 STKWS AND HASHES, 

broth enough to cover it. Let it stew gently, then add some 
cloves, a bunch of sweet herbs, white pepper and salt. Let 
them stew gently, till the fish is done ; then take it out, 
thicken the sauce with butter and flour, and pour it over the 
fish. 

Lobsters. 

BOIL the lobsters, and pick the meat clean from the shells. 
Take a pint of water, a little mace, a little whole pepper, and 
the shells of the lobsters. Let them boil till all their goodness 
is out ; then strain off the liquor, and put it into a saucepan. 
Put in the lobsters with a bit of butter rolled in flour, half 
a pint of veal gravy, a spoonful or two of white wine, a 
spoonful of essence of anchovy, and a little juice of lemon. 
"Let them boil, and then lay them in the dish. 

Lampreys and Eels. 

HAVING skinned and gutted your lampreys, season them 
well with salt, pepper, a little lemon peel shred fine, mace, 
cloves, and nutmeg. Cut some thin slices of butter into the 
bottom of your saucepan, and put your fish into the pan, with 
half a pint of good gravy, a gill of white wine or cyder, the 
same of claret, a spoonful of essence of anchovy, a bundle of 
marjorum, winter savory, and thyme, and an onion sliced. 
Stew them over a slow fire, and keep the lampreys turning 
till quite tender ; then take them out, and thicken the sauce 
with the yolk of an egg, or a little butter rolled in flour, and 
having poured it over the fish, send them up to table. 

Eels may be stewed in the same manner. 

Flounders, Plaice, and Soles. 

THESE three different species of fish may be stewed in one 
and the same manner. Half fry them in butter till of a fine 
brown ; then take them up, put to your butter a quart of 
water, two anchovies, and an onion sliced, and boil them 
slowly a quarter of an hour. Put your fish in again, with two 
anchovies, and stew gently twenty minutes. Take out the fish, 
put in a spoonful of lemon pickfe, and thicken the sauce with 
butter and flour; having given it a boil, strain it through a 
tamis over the fish, and serve up with oyster, cockle, or shrimp 
sauce. 

Stewed Cod. 

CUT some slices of cod, and season with nutmeg, pepper, 
and salt: put them into a stewpan with a gill of water, and 
two gills of gravy : cover close, and after stewing a short time, 
add half a pint of white wine, some lemon juice, a few 
oysters with their liquor, a piece of butter rolled in flour, and 



STEWS AND HASHES. 75 

two or three blades of mace: the fish will take a quarter of an 
hour to stew, when they are to be served up, with the sauce 
over them. 

Stewed Cod's Head and Shoulders, in the Scotch manner. 

BOIL the fish till nearly enough, take it out ; put it in a 
stewpan with two bottles of strong ale; two ounces of butter; 
one spoonful of essence of anchovy ; one spoonful of lernon 
pickle; a pint of beef gravy; two onions; a few oysters ; 
white pepper and salt : let it stew till the fish is done ; and 
strain the sauce over it. 

Holibut may be done in the same manner, adding force- 
meat balls, made of a part of the fish chopped, shred thyme, 
parsley, and marjorum, a little nutmeg, pepper, and salt, rolled 
in egg, and fried butter. 

To make Water-Souclice, of Perch, Plaice, or Flounders. 

WASH clean, and cut the fins close off the fish ; take three 
pints of water, a few of the fish, some clean picked and 
washed parsley, parsley-roots washed and sliced, and stew 
till quite tender : pulp them through a sieve: put the liquor 
and pulp into a stewpan, together with the fish you mean to 
water-souchee, adding more parsley and parsley-roots as be- 
fore, a little white pepper and salt: stew till done, and serve 
up with the liquor, parsley, and roots. 

Stewed Oysters. 

OYSTERS for stewing, should be of the largest kind : put 
the oysters in their own liquor on to blanch, and as soon as 
they boil, take them up, lay them on a cloth to dry, and 
strain the liquor through a tamis : melt a bit of butter in a 
stewpan, and when melted, add a little flour and their liquor: 
stir till it boil, and add half a glass of white wine, a little 
beaten mace, white pepper and salt, and half a pint of coulis 
(see Sauces) : boil for a few minutes; put in the oysters, and 
simmer for a minute or two : serve with sippets. 

Escaloped Oysters. 

BLANCH the oysters, beard them, and strain the liquor; put 
a bit of butter into a stewpan, and when melted, add as much 
flour as will dry up the butter : now add the oyster liquor and 
a little good stock (see Sauces}, half a spoonful of essence of 
anchovy, a little grated nutmeg, white pepper, and salt: boil 
for a few minutes ; put in the oysters to heat through, and 
fill the escalop-shells, having previously buttered them : strew 



76 RAGOUTS. 

grated bread over them, and drop oiled butter on the top : put 
them into an oven, or Dutch oven, and if not sufficiently 
brown, hold the salamander over them. 

Prawns, Shrimps, or Crawfish. 

TAKE about two quarts, and pick out their tails. Bruise 
the bodies, and put them into half a pint of white wine or 
cyder, with a blade of mace, and some coulisY^e Sauces}. 
Let them stew a quarter of an hour, then stir together, and 
strain : wash out the saucepan, and put tflnt the strained li- 
quor and tails. Grate in a little nutmeg, add salt, white pep- 
per, and a quarter of a pound of butter rolled in flour. Shake 
all together ; cut a thin toast round a quartern loaf, toast 
brown, on both sides, cut into six pieces, lay close together in 
the bottom of your dish, and pour your fish and sauce over it. 
Send it hot to table. 



CHAPTER IX. 



RAGOUTS. 

Afore Quarter of House Lamb. 

V^UT off the knuckle bone, and take off the skin. Lard it all 
over with bacon, and fry of a nice light brown. Then put it 
into a stewpan, and just cover over with mutton gravy, a bunch 
of sweet herbs, some pepper, salt, beaten mace, and a little 
whole pepper. Cover close, and stew for half an hour. Pour 
out the liquor, and take care to keep the lamb hot. Strain 
off the gravy, and have ready half a pint of oysters fried 
brown. Pour all the fat from them, add them to the gravy, 
with two spoonsful of red wine, a few mushrooms, and a bit 
of butter rolled in flour. Simmer all together, with the juice 
of half a lemon. Lay the lamb in the dish, and pour the sauce 
over it. 

Beef. 

TAKE a large piece of flank of beef, which is fat at the top, 
or any piece that is fat at the top and has no bones in it, even 
the rump will answer the purpose. Strip the bone very 
nicely, flour the meat well, and fry it brown in a large stew- 
pan, with a little butter ; then cover with stock (see Sauces), 
adding a pint of port wine, two spoonsful of walnut ketchup, 
an ounce of truffles and morels, cut small, and some fried or 



RAGOUTS. 11 

dried mushrooms also cut small. Cover close, and let it stew 
till the sauce be rich and thick. Then have ready some ar- 
tichoke bottoms quartered, and a few pickled mushrooms. 
Give the whole a simmer, and when your meat is tender, and 
your sauce rich, lay the meat into a dish, and pour the sauce 
over it. You may add a sweetbread cut in six pieces, a 
palate stewed tender, and cut into little pieces, some cocks- 
combs, and a few forcemeat balls. 

Ox Palates. 
CLEAN them well, and boil very tender. 

Calf's Feet.

frying-pan, and put them in some good beef gravy, with mo- 
rels, truffles, and pickled mushrooms, the yolks of four eggs 
boiled hard, some salt, and a little butter rolled in flour. 

. 
Breast of Veal. 

HAVING half roasted a breast of veal, bone it, and put it 
into a tossing-pan, with a quart of veal gravy, an ounce of 
morels, and the same quantity of truffles. Stew till tender, 
and just before you thicken the gravy, put in a few oysters, 
some pickled mushrooms, and pickled cucumbers, all cut in 
small square pieces, and the yolks of four eggs, boiled hard. 
Cut your sweetbread in pieces, and fry of a light brown. Dish 
up your veal, and pour the gravy hot upon it. 

Neck of Veal. 

HAVING cut a neck of veal into steaks, flatten them with a 
rolling-pin. Season them with salt, pepper, cloves, and mace ; 
lard them with bacon, lemon-peel, and thyme, and dip them 
into the yolks of eggs. Make a sheet of strong foolscap paper 
up at the four corners, in the form of a dripping-pan. Pin up 
the corners, butter the paper, and also the gridiron, and set it 
over a charcoal fire. Put in your meat, and let it do lei- 
surely, keeping it basting and turning to keep in the gravy. 
When enough, have ready half a pint of strong cullis (see 
Sauces), season high, arid put in mushrooms and pickles, 
forcemeat balls dipped in the yolks of eggs, oysters stewed 
and fried, to lay round and at the top of your dish, and then 
serve it up. If for a brown ragout, put in red wine ; but if for 
a white one, put in white wine, with the yolks of eggs beat 
up with two or three spoonsful of cream. 



"i S RAGOUTS. 



Sweetbreads (brown). 

TAKE throat sweetbreads, previously blanched and cut into 
slices ; morels blanched and cut in halves ; stewed mush- 
rooms ; egg balls (see Sauces) ; artichoke bottoms or Jerusa-

to the sweetbreads, c. : simmer for five minutes (but do not 
boil ) , and serve. 

Leg of Mutton. 

TAKE off all the skin and fat, and cut it very thin the right 
way of the grain ; then butter your stewpan, and shake some 
Hour into it. Slice half a lemon, and half an onion, cut them 
very small, and add a little bundle of sweet herbs, and a blade 
of mace. Put these and your meat into the pan, stir a 
minute or two, and then put in six spoonsful of gravy. Have 
ready an anchovy, minced small, and mixed with some but-

all over, add to it a quart of beef stock (see Sauces), boiling 
hot, a bunch of sweet herbs, a blade of mace, a few cloves, 
some whole pepper, two or three small onions, and a bay leaf! 



RAGOUTS. 19 

Cover very close, and stew very softly. An hour will do it, 
if a small one ; if a large one, an hour and a half. Make the 
following ragout for it : some turnips and carrots cut as for a 
harrico of-mutton, and some onions, all boiled enongh, and 
half a pint of rich beef stock. Put them all into astewpan, 
with some pepper, salt, and a piece of butter rolled in flour. 
Let them stew a quarter of an hour. Take the goose out of 
the stewpan when done, drain well from the liquor it was 
stewed in, serve in a dish, and pour the ragout over it. 

Pigs Feet and Ears. 

HAVING stewed the feet and ears in good veal stock, split tjae 
feet down the middle, and cut the ears in narrow slices : dip 
them in yolk of egg and grated bread, and fry brown. 
Put a little veal stock in a tossing-pan, with a tea-spoonful of 
lemon-pickle, a large one of mushroom ketchup, the same of 
browning, and a little salt. Thicken with a lump of butter 
rolled in flour, and put in your feet and ears. Let them boil 
gently, and when enough, lay your feet in the middle of the 
dish, and the ears round them ; then strain your gravy, pour 
it over them. 

Livers, 

TAKE as many livers as you would have for your dish. The 
liver of a turkey, and six fowl livers, will make a pretty dish. 
Pick the galls from them, and throw them into cold water. 
Put the livers in a saucepan with a quarter of a pint of stock, 
a spoonful of mushrooms, either pickled or fresh, the same 
quantity of ketchup, and a piece of butter the size of a nut- 
meg, rolled in flour. Season to your taste with pepper and 
salt, and let them stew gently ten minutes. In the meantime 
broil the turkey's liver nicely, and lay it in the middle, with 
the stewed livers round it. Pour the sauce over all, and 
serve. 

Mushrooms. 

PEEL some large mushrooms, and take out the inside. 
Broil them on a gridiron, and when the outside is brown, put 
them in a tossing-pan, with stock (see Sauces), sufficient to 
cover them : let them stand ten minutes, add a spoonful of 
port wine, the same of bVowning, and a very little eschalot 
vinegar. Thicken with butter and flour, and boil a little. 
Serve it up with sippets round the dish. 

Artichoke Bottoms. 

LET them lie in warm water for two or three hours chang- 
ing the water. Put to them some good gravy, mushroom 



80 RAGOUTS. 

ketchup, or powder, cayenne and salt. Thicken with a little 
flour, and boil all together. 

Asparagus. 

SCRAPE one hundred of grass very clean, and throw it into 
cold water; then cut it as far as it is good and green, about 
an inch long, and take two ends of endive, clean picked and 
washed, and cut very small ; a young lettuce, clean washed, 
and cut small, and a large onion peeled and cut small. Put a 
quarter of a pound of butter into a stewpan, and when melt- 
ed, throw in the above ingredients. Toss them about, and 
fry them ten minutes; then season with a little pepper and 
salt, shake in a little flour, toss them about, and pour in half 
a pint of veal stock. Let them stew till the sauce is very 
thick and good, and then pour all into your dish. Garnish the 
dish with a few of the little tops of the grass. 

Cucumbers. 

TAKE two cucumbers and two onions : slice and fry them 
in a little butter : drain them in a sieve, and put them into a 
saucepan ; add six spoonsful of stock, two of white wine, and 
a blade of mace. Let them stew five or six minutes ; and take 
a piece of butter the size of a walnut, rolled in flour, a little 
salt and cayenne pepper. Shake them together, and when 
thick, serve up. 

Cauliflowers. 

WASH a large cauliflower very clean, and pick it into pieces 
as for pickling : take brown cullis, and stew till tender : sea- 
son with pepper and salt, and put them into the dish with the 
sauce over them. 

Muscles. 

MELT a little butter in a stewpan, take the muscles out of 
their shells, fry them a minute with a little chopped parsley ; 
shake over them a little flour, put in a little cream, white 
pepper, salt, nutmeg, and lemon juice. Boil them up. If they 
are to be brown, put good gravy instead of cream. 

Another Method. 

WHEN the muscles are well cleaned, stew them without 
water till they open. Take from them the shells, and save 
the liquor. Put into a stewpan a bit of butter, with a few 
mushrooms chopped, a little parsley, and a little grated le- 
mon peel : stir this a little about, put in some stock, with pep- 
per and salt ; thicken with a little flour, boil it up, put in the 



FfclCANDEAUS. 81 

muscles with a little liquor, and let them be hot. When mus- 
cles are stewed, throw among them half a crown, or any piece 
of silver; if that be not discoloured, the muscles may be eaten 
w tn the greatest safety, without taking any thing out of them, 
as is the usual method. 

Oysters. 

BLANCH two dozen large oysters, and having preserved the 
liquor, wash and beard them : put into a stewpan, adding 
stewed mushrooms ; a throat sweetbread, blanched and cut 
into slices; the liquor strained from the sediment; a quarter 
of a pint of strong veal stock (see Sauces} ; two spoonfuls of 
ketchup; one spoonful of lemon pickle; cayenne, and salt

forcemeat containing oysters (see Sauces) ; fasten up the in- 
cision with a small and clean wire skewer ; lard neatly with 
fat bacon, and put into a stewpan with a little weak stock ; 
stew till brown and tender: into another stewpan put carrots, 
onions, turnips, celery, all cut small ; allspice, two cloves, and 
a little pepper : over these put some slices of fat bacon ; then 
put in the fricandeau, with some good veal stock (see Sauces ) : 
let the whole simmer till the veal is exceedingly tender, and 
the gravy is nearly reduced. Have ready some stewed sorrel 
(see Stewing), and serve the veal upon it: or for want of 
sorrel, take stewed spinage (see Stewing) , and make it a little 
acid with lemon juice. 

Beef. 

CUT some slices of beef five or six inches long, and half an 
inch thick ; lard them with bacon, dredge with flour, and set 
it in a Dutch oven before a brisk fire to brown : ihen put 
it in a stewpan with a quart of good stock (see Sauces J, some 
truffles, morels, and half a lemon cut in slices; stew half 
an hour ; add one spoonful of ketchup, one spoonful of brown-

stewpan with a pint of stock (see Sauces) , two spoonfuls of 
walnut ketchup ; a spoonful of eschalot vinegar ; a gill of port 
wine ; some onions, carrots, turnips, and celery, all cut small; 
cover close and stew till very tender, and all the liquor is 
nearly reduced: take up the mutton, glaze it (see Sauces J ,

N. B. All lardings should be put into the oven a few mi- 
nutes before they are glazed. 

Fowl. 

BONE a large fowl without cutting the skin, and singe it ; 
lard it, and lay the bottom of a stewpan with slices of bacon ; 
upon the bacon lay the bones of the fowl and any other 
trimmings, and upon these, the fowl ; put in a pint of weak 
stock (see Sauces}, a few bay leaves, onions, a faggot of sweet 
herbs ; cover the fowl with slices of bacon, arjd over that a 
sheet of paper cut to the size of the stewpan : set it on a stove, 
put fire on the top of the stewpan, and simmer slowly for one 
hour and a half: take it up, put into an oven for a few 
minutes to raise the larding ; glaze (see Sauces) , and serve 
up on stewed endive. See Stewing. 

Turtle 

MAY be dressed in .the same manner as veal, having a little 
white wine added to it.

FRICASEES. 83 

Calf's Feet. 

BOIL them, take out the long bones, split, and put them 
into a stewpan with some veal stock, and a very little white 
wine. Beat the yolks of two or three eggs with a little cream, 
and put to them a liitle grated nutmeg, some salt, and a piece 
of butter. Stir till of a proper thickness. 

Swettbreads (white). 

SCALD, and cut them in long slices; thicken some veal 
stock with a bit of butter mixed with flour, a little cream,

84- PRICASKES. 

Chickens (white}. 

CUT them into pieces, and blanch and drain them dry ; put 
(hem into a stewpan with a little veal stock (see Sauces ) , a 
blade of mace, and an onion : stew gently till three parts done; 
add slices of blanched throat sweetbreads ; white button mush- 
rooms, stewed ; egg-balls (see Sauces}, and pieces of artichoke 
bottoms previously blanched and parboiled; when nearly 
stewed, season with white pepper, salt, and lemon juice ; 
simmer till done ; take up the chickens ; set the sauce on the 
fire till nearly reduced, and add benshamelle (see Sauces}. 

Chickens (brown}. 

CUT the chickens into pieces ; fry them in a little lard till 
of a light brown ; drain them in a cloth very dry ; put them 
in a stewpan ; add button rnushrooms stewed, pieces of arti- 
choke bottoms previously blanched and parboiled, blanched 
truffles, morels, egg balls (see Sauces}, a spoonful of brown- 
ing (see Sauces}, and some well seasoned cullis ; stew gently 
till done, and serve with fried oysters. 

Pulled Chicken. 

BOIL a chicken till three parts done, and let it stand till 
cold ; take off the skin, cut the white meat into slips, put 
them into a stewpan, add a little cream, four spoonsful of 
veal stock, a very little grated lemon peel, and pounded 
mace, cayenne, salt, one eschalot chopped, a little lemon juice, 
and a spoonful of consume (see Sauces} ; thicken it with a 
little flour and water, set over the fire for ten minutes to sim- 
mer ; in the meantime score the legs and rump, season with 
pepper and salt, broil of a good colour, and serve them up 
over the pulled chicken. 

Pulled Fowl. 

PROCEED as with the chicken ; but instead of thickening 
with flour and water, add, five minutes before it is to be 
served up, a leason (see Sauces} of two eggs. 

Pulled Turkey. 

PROCEED as with the chicken ; but instead of thickening 
with flour and water, add, ten minutes before it is to be served 
up, some benshamelle. 

Pigeons. 

CUT your pigeons as above described for chickens, and fry 
them of a light brown. Put them into some good mutton, 
stock, and stew them near half an hour; then put in a slice 
of lemon, half an ounce of morels, and a spoonful of brown- 
ing. Thicken your gravy, and strain it over your pigeons. 

Another method to fricasee pigeons is as follows : take eight 



FIUCASEES. 85 

pigeons, just killed, and cut them in small pieces. Put them 
into a stewpan, with a pint of water, and the same quantity 
of claret. Season them with pepper and salt, a blade or two 
of mace, an onion, a bundle of sweet herbs, and a large piece 
of butter rolled in a little flour. Cover close, and Jet them 
stew till there is just enough for sauce. Then take out the 
onion and sweet herbs, beat up the yolks of three eggs, grate 
a little nutmeg, and with a spoon push the meat to one side 
of the pan, and the gravy to the other, and stir in the eggs. 
Keep them stirring to prevent their curdling, and when the 
sauce is fine and thick, shake all together. Put the meat into 
the dish, pour the sauce over it, and have ready some slices 
of bacon toasted, and oysters fried : scatter the oysters over 
it, and Jay the bacon round it. 

Rabbits (white). 

PROCEED as directed for chickens; but when nearly stewed, 
season with salt, white pepper, and a little lemon juice ; add 
a leason (see Sauces) of three eggs; simmer for five minutes,

and fry them in fresh butter. Then pour out the butter, put 
in as much stock as you may want for sauce, a bundle of 
sweet herbs, an onion, some pepper and salt, a blade or two 
of mace, and a glass of white wine. Having simmered all 
together about half an hour, take out the tongues, strain the 
gravy, and put both that and the tongues into the stewpan 
again. Beat up the yolks cf two eggs, a little nutmeg grated, 
and a small piece of butter rolled in flour. Shake all toge- 
ther for four or five minutes, and dish it up. 

Tripe (white). 

CUT the tripe into small slips, and boil in a little consume 
(see Sauces) , till the liquor is nearly reduced ; add a leason 
(see Sauces) of two yolks of eggs and cream, salt, cayenne, 
and chopped parsley simmer over a slow fire for five 
minutes, and serve : or instead of the leason, benshamelle and 
chopped parsley may be added. 

Tripe (brown). 

CUT the tripe into triangular shapes; add mushrooms chop- 
ped fine, a little scalded parsley chopped, an anchovy rubbed 



through a hair sieve, a spoonful of ketchup, browning, and 
white wine, a gill of cullis (see Sauces} , season to the palate 
with cayenne, white pepper, and salt ; simmer gently till 
done, and serve hot. 

Artichoke Bottoms. 

THESE may be fricaseed, either dried or pickled ; if dried, 
lay them three or four hours in warm water, shifting the water 
two or three times : have ready a little cream, and a piece of 
fresh butter, stirred together one way over the fire till it is 
melted: put in the artichokes, and when hot, serve them up. 

Mushrooms. 

HAVING peeled and scraped the inside of } r our mushrooms, 
throw them into salt and water ; but if buttons, rub them with 
flannel: take them out and boil them in water, with some salt 
in it, and when tender, put in a little shred parsley, and an 
onion stuck with cloves. Toss them up, with a good piece of 
butter rolled in flour, and add two spoonfuls of thick cream, 
and a little grated nutmeg ; the onion must be taken out before 
you send your mushrooms to table. Instead of the parsley, 
you may, if you choose, put in a glass of wine. 

Skirrets. 

HAVING washed the roots well, and boiled them till they 
are tender, take off the skin of the roots, and cut them into 
slices. Have ready a little cream, a piece of butter rolled in 
: flour, the yolk of an egg beaten, a little nutmeg grated, two 
or three spoonfuls of white wine, a very little salt, and stir all 
together. Put your roots into the dish, and pour the sauce 
over them. 

Eggs. 

BOIL your eggs hard, and take out some of the yolks whole. 
Then cut the rest in quarters, yolks and whites together. 
Set on some stock, with a little shred thyme and parsley in 
it, and give it a boil or two. Then put in your eggs with a 
little grated nutmeg, and shake it up with a piece of butter, 
till of a proper thickness. Fry artichoke bottoms in thin 
slices, and garnish with eggs boiled hard, and shred small. 

Eggs, with Onions and Mushrooms. 

BOIL the eggs hard, take the yolks out whole, cut the whites 
in slips, with some onions and mushrooms, and fry the onions 
and mushrooms. Throw in the whites, and turn them about 
a httle. If there is any fat pour it off. Flour the onions, &c 
put to it a little good stock, boil this up, and add pepper and 
salt, and the yolks. 



FRICASEES. 87 

Cod Sounds. 

CLEAN them well, and cut them into small pieces. Boil 
them tender in milk and water, and put them to drain. Put 
them into a clean saucepan, and season them with beaten mace 
and grated nutmeg, and a little white pepper and salt. Pour in 
a cupful of cream, with a good piece of butter rolled in flour, 
and keep shaking it till thick enough. 

Soles. 

SKIN, gut, and wash your soles very clean, cut off their 
heads, and dry your fish in a cloth. Then very carefully cut 
the flesh from the bones and fins on both sides, and cut the flesh 
longways, and then across, so that each sole may be in eight 
pieces. Take the heads and bones, and put them into a sauce- 
pan, with a pint of water, a bundle of -sweet herbs, an onion, a 
little whole pepper, two or three blades of mace, a little salt, a 
small piece of lemon peel, and a crust of bread. Cover close, 
and let it boil till half be wasted. Then strain through a fine 
sieve, and put it into a stewpan. Put in the soles and with 
them half a pint of white wine, a little parsley chopped fine, 
a few mushrooms cut small, a little grated nutmeg, and a 
piece of butter rolled in flour. Set all together on the fire, but 
keep shaking the pan all the while till the fish is enough. 

Plaice and Flounders. 

RUN your knife all along upon the bone on the back side of 
the fish, and raise the flesh on both sides, from the head to 
the tail. Then take out the bone clear, and cut your fish in 
six collops. Dry it well, sprinkle with salt, dredge them with 
flour, and fry them in a pan of hot beef dripping, so that the 
fish may be crisp. Take it out of the pan, and keep it warm 
before the fire; then clean the pan, and put into it some 
minced oysters, and their liquor strained, some white wine, a 
little grated nutmeg, and three anchovies. Having "stewed 
these up together, put in half a pound of butter, and then 
your fish. Toss them well together, dish them on sippets, and 
pour the sauce over them. 

Skate or Thornback. 

HAVING cut the meat clean from the bone, fins, &c. make it 
very clean. Then cut it into thin pieces, about an inch broad, 
and two inches long, and lay them in your stewpan. To one 
pound of the flesh put a quarter of a pint of water, a little 
beaten mace, and grated nutmeg ; a small bundle of sweet 
herbs, and a little salt. Cover it and let it boil fifteen minutes. 
Take out the sweet herbs, put in a quarter of a pint of good 



88 MADE DISHES. 

cream, a piece of butter, the size of a walnut, rolled in flour, 
and a glass of white wine. Keep shaking the pan ail the 
time one way, till it is thick and smooth ; then serve. 

Fish in general. 

Tofricasee fish in general, melt butter according to the 
quantity of your fish, and cut your fish in pieces of the length 
and breadth of three fingers. Then put them and your but- 
ter into a stewpan, and put it on the fire : but take care that 
it does not boil too fast, as that may break the fish, and turn 
the butter into oil. Turn them often, till enough, having first 
put in a bunch of sweet herbs, an onion, two or three an- 
chovies cut small, a little pepper and salt, some nutmeg, mace, 
lemon peel, and two or three cloves ; then put in some claret, 
and let them stew altogether. Beat up six yolks of eggs, and 
put them in with such pickles as you please, as mushrooms, 
capers, and oysters. Shake them well together, that they 
may not curdle ; and if you put the spice in whole, take it out 
when done. The seasoning ought to be stewed first in a little 
water, and the butter melted in that and the wine before you 
put your fish in. Jacks eat very well done in this manner. 



CHAPTER XII. 

MADE DISHES. 

PRELIMINARY HINTS AND OBSERVATIONS. 

As this is one of the most important chapters in this book, 
it may not be improper to give the young cook some general 
hints. It is an important point to take care that all the cop- 
per-vessels are well tinned, and kept perfectly clean from any 
foulness or grittiness. Before you put eggs or cream into 
your white sauce, have all your other ingredients well boiled, 
and the whole of a proper thickness ; for neither eggs nor 
cream will contribute much to thicken it. After you have put 
them in, do not stir them with a spoon, nor set your pan on 
the fire, for fear it should gather at the bottom, and be lum- 
py ; but hold your pan at a proper height from the fire, and 
keep shaking it round one way, which will keep the sauce from 
curdling; and be particularly cautious that you do not suffer 
it tp boU. Remember to take out your collops, meat, or what' 



MADE DISHES. 89 

ever you are dressing, with a fish slice, and strain your sauce 
upon it, which will prevent small bits of meat mixing with 
your sauce, and thereby leave it clear and fine. In browning 
dishes, be particularly cautious that no fat rioats on the top of 
your gravy, which will be the case if you do not properly 
skim it. It should be of a fin, 1 bro n, without any one pre- 
dominant taste, which must depend on the judicious propor- 
tion in the mixture of your various articles of ingredients. . If 
you make use of wine, or anchovy, take off its rawness, by 
putting it in some time before your dish is ready ; for nothing 
injures the reputation of a made dish so much as raw wine, or 
fresh anchovy. Be sure to put your fried forcemeat balls to 
drain on a sieve, that the fat may run from them ; and never 
let them boil in your sauce, as that will soften them and give 
them a greasy appearance. To put them in after the meat 
is dished up, is indisputably the best method. In almost 
every made dish, you may use forcemeat balls, morels, truffles, 
artichoke bottoms, and pickled mushrooms; and, in several 
made dishes, a roll of forcemeat may supply the place of 
balls ; and where it can be used with propriety, it is to be pre- 
ferred. 

Beef-a-la-mode, 

HAVING boned a rump of beef, lard the top with bacon, 
and make the following forcemeat : take four ounces of 
marrow, the crumb of a penny loaf, a few sweet herbs (hop- 
ped small, one clove of garlick, and season with salt, pepper, 
and nutmeg ; then beat up the yolks of four eo;gs. mix all 
together, and stuff it into the beef where the bone was ex- 
tracted, and also in several of the lean parts. Skewer it 
round and fasten it properly with a tape. Put it into the pot, 
adding a pint of red wine, and tie the pot down with a strong 
paper. Put it into the oven for three or four hours, and 
when it comes out, if to be eaten hot, skim the fat from 
the gravy, and add a spoonful of pickled mushrooms, and half 
an ounce of morels. Thicken with flour and butter, serve 
up, and pour on your gravy. Garnish it with forcemeat 
balls. 

Or take a thick flank, and with a sharp knife make holes 
deep enough for the following larding: bacon cut into Jong 
slices nearly an inch thick, dipped first into vinegar, and after- 
wards into black pepper, allspice, a clove, and salt, all finely 
powdered; parsley, thyme, marjoram, and chives, shred very 
fine : with this larding fill all the holes in the beef ; rub the 
remainder of the spices and herbs upon the beef, and bind up 
tight with a tape : put the beef into a stewpan with a pint of 



y() MADE DISHES. 

water, a pint of table beer, four spoonsful of vinegar, four 
onions previously roasted, two carrots, one turnip, and two 
heads of celery, cut in pieces : stew very gently for six or 
eight hours , take up the beef, pull off the tape, skim the 
gravy, strain off the herbs, and to the gravy add a glass of 
port wine: let it boil five minutes; and serve in a tureen, 
pouring it over the beef. 

Beef-a-la-royal. 

TAKE a brisket of beef, bone it, and with a knife make holes 
in it about an inch from each other. Fill one hole with fat 
bacon, a second with parsley chopped, and a third with chop- 
ped oysters. Let these stuffings be seasoned with pepper, 
salt, and nutmeg. U hen the beef is completely stuffed, 
pour upon it a pint of wine boiling hot, then dredge it well 
with flour, and send it to the oven. Let it remai'i in the oven 
better than three hours, and when it comes out, skim off the 
fat, strain the gravy over the beef, and serve. 

Beef -a-la- daub. 

BONE a rump of beef, or take a part of the leg-of-mutton 
piece, or a piece of the buttock, and daub either of them with 
slips of fat bacon, seasoned with sweet herbs, eschalots, beaten 
spices, pepper, and salt: bind it round with tape, and having 
put it into a stewpan with a sufficiency of weak stock, braise 
till tender (set Sauces); wipe dry, glaze the top, serve up 
with the same round it; and either onion, savoy, haricot, or 
ashee sauces. 

Beef Olives. 

TAKE rump-steaks cut rather thin, and having trimmed them 
neatly, beat well with a paste-pin ; rub them over with yolk 
of egg, and sprinkle them with sweet herbs shred fine, and 
seasoned with pepper and salt : roll them up tight, and having 
put a little stock at the bottom of a stewpan that will exactly 
hold them, lay them in, cover with sheets of fat bacon, and 
over them with writing paper: stew them very gently over a 
stove till tender, take up the beef, put aside the bacon, strain 
and skim the gravy, and to it add a spoonful of ketchup, the 
same of port wine, half a pint of sauce tournay (see Sauces}, 
a spoonful of browning, cayenne pepper, and salt: thicken 
with flour ; let it boil, and pour OA'er the beef. 

Beef tremblonque. 

TIE up closely the fat end of a brisket of beef, and boil it 
six hours very gently. Season the water with a little salt, 



MADE DISHES. 91 

allspice, two onions, two turnips, and a carrot. In the mean- 
time, put a piece of butter into a stewpan, and melt it. Then 
put in two spoonfuls of flour, and stir till smooth. Put in a 
quart of stock, a spoonful of ketchup, the same of browning, 
turnips and carrots, and cut them as for harrico of mutton : 
stew gently till the roots are tender, and season with pepper 
and salt. Skim the fat clean off, put the beef in a dish, and 
pour the sauce "over it. 

Beef Chops. 

TAKE rump-steaks, or the fillet from the under part of a 
rump of beef : cut into small thin slices, fry in butter till half 
done : add slices of pickled cucumbers, small mushrooms 
stewed, oysters blanched, and some well seasoned coulis (see 
Sauces) : stew till tender. 

Fillet of Beef. 

FROM a small rump of beef, take out the bone, and force 
the cavity with the following forcemeat : lean veal, ham, and 
fat bacon cut in pieces; chopped parsley, thyme, eschalots, 
blanched oysters, pepper, salt, lemon juice, a few cleaned 
mushrooms, grated bread, and yolks of eggs : turn it round 
like a fillet of veal ; and having covered it with paper, half 
roast it : put it in a stewpan with some good stock ; simmer 
till tender and the gravy is nearly consumed, take up the beef, 
wipe dry, and glaze: skim the gravy, and add a spoonful of le- 
mon pickle, two of ketchup, and a quarter of a pint of ravigot 
sauce (see Sauces) : give the sauce a boil, and serve, pouring 
the sauce round the meat. 

Bouillie Beef. 

PUT the thick end of a brisket of beef into a kettle, and 
cover it over with water. Let it boil fast for two hours, then 
stew it close by the fireside for six hours more : put in with 
the beef some turnips cut in slices, some carrots, and some 
celery cut in pieces. About an hour before it is done, take as 
much stock as will fill your tureen, and boil in it, for an hour, 
turnips and carrots cut out in little round or square pieces, 
with some celery, and season it to your taste with salt and 
pepper. Serve in the tureen. 

Bouillie Beef au Choux. 

TAKE six pounds of brisket of beef which has been salted 
two days : stew in weak stock till tender : whilst stewing, cut 
a large cabbage in slices, wash clean, then blanch and squeeze 
it : put into a stewpan with half a pound of fresh butter, an 



92 MADE DISHES. 

onion stuck with four cloves, half a gill of vinegar, a tea- 
spoonful of coriander seeds pounded and sifted, a clove of 
garlic, white pepper and salt: set the whole over a slow fire 
till the cabbage is nearly done ; then add a pint of veal stock 
(see Sauces), and a little flour; stew the cabbage till tender, 
without burning it: wipe the beef dry, glaze it ; and serve, 
with the cabbage round it. 

Sirloin of Beef en Epigram. 

HAVING roasted a sirloin of beef, take it off the spit, and 
raise the skin carefully off. Then cut out the lean part of the 
beef, but observe not to cut near the ends or sides. Hash the 
meat in the following manner : cut it into pieces about the 
size of a crown-piece, put half a pint of stock into a tossing 
pan, an onion chopped fine, two spoonsful of ketchup, some 
pepper and salt, six small pickled cucumbers cut in thin slices, 
and the gravy that comes from the beef, with a little butter 
rolled in flour. Put in the meat, and toss it up for five mi- 
nutes ; put it on the sirloin, and then put the skin over, and 
send it to table. 

The Inside of a Sirloin of Beef forced. 

LIFT up the fat of the inside, and with a sharp knife cut 
off all the meat close to the bone. Chop it small : take a 
pound of suet, and chop that small ; as much grated bread, 
a little lemon peel, thyme, pepper and salt, half a nutmeg 
grated, and two eschalots chopped fine. Mix all together with 
a glass of red wine, and then put the meat into the place you 
took it from ; cover it with the skin and fat, skewer it down 
with fine skewers, and cover with paper. The paper must 
not be taken off till the meat is put on the dish, and your 
meat must be spitted before you take out the inside. Take a 
quarter of a pint of red wine, two eschalots shred small, and a 
spoonful of garlic vinegar ; boil them, and pour into the dish 
with the gravy that comes out of the meat. 

The Inside of a Rump of Beef forced. 

THIS must be done nearly in the same manner as the above ; 
only lift up the outside skin, take the middle of the meat, and 
proceed as before directed. Put it into the same place, and 
with fine skewers put it down close. 

A Round of Beef forced. 

FIRST rub it with some common salt, a little bay-salt, some 
saltpetre, and coarse sugar ; then let it stand a full week or 



MADE DISHES. 95 

more, according to the size, turning it every day. Wash and 
dry it, lard it a little, and make holes, which fill with grated 
bread, marrow, or suet, parsley, grated lemon-peel, sweet 
herbs, pepper, salt, nutmeg, yolk of an egg, made into stuf- 
fing. Bake it with a little water, and some small beer, some 
whole pepper, and an onion. It may be boiled, and is a hand- 
some sideboard dish for a large company. 

Baked Beef. 

TAKE either the sticking, clod, leg, or tops of the ribs 
boned : wash clean, chop together parsley, thyme, eschalots, 
marjoram, savory, and basil, of each a moderate quantity, and 
season with kitchen pepper (see Sauces) : with these ingre- 
dients rub the beef well, lay it in an earthen pan, adding half 
a pint of port wine (or stale strong beer) a gill of vinegar, 
ten whole onions peeled, two bay leaves, and a few fresh 
mushrooms, or mushroom powder, let it remain twenty-four 
hours ; then add water to cover it, and bake in a slow oven, 
tying paper over the pan : when baked, take up the meat, 
strain the gravy, skim off' the fat, and serve in a tureen with 
the beef. 

Beef steaks rolled. 

TAKE what quantity you want of beef steaks, and beat them 
with a cleaver to make them tender ; make some forcemeat 
with a pound of veal beat fine in a mortar, the flesh of a fowl, 
half a pound of cold ham or gammon of bacon, fat and lean ; 
the kidney fat of a loin of veal, and a sweetbread, all cut 
very fine : some truffles and morels stewed, and then cut 
small, two eschalots, some parsley, a little thyme, some lemon- 
peel, the yolks of four eggs, a little grated nutmeg, and half a 
pint of cream . Mix all these together, and stir them over a slow 
fire ten minutes. Put them upon the steaks, and roll them up; 
then skewer them tight, put them into the frying-pan, and fry 
them of a nice brown. Then take them from the fat, and put 
them into a stewpan, with a pint of good stock, a spoonful of 
red wine, two of ketchup, a few pickled mushrooms, and let 
them stew for a quarter of an hour. 

Bosuf a la Vinegrette. 

FROM the round of beef cut a slice of three inches thick, 
with very little fat. Stew it in water and a glass of white wine, 
seasoned with salt, pepper, cloves, a bunch of sweet herbs, 
and a bay leaf. Let it simmer till the liquor is almost con- 
sumed ; and when cold, serve it up. What liquor remains, 
strain off, and mix with a little vinegar. 



MADK DISH I . 



Ox Cheek. 

BONE and clean wash the cheek ; tie it up like a rump of 
beef, put it in a stewingpan with some stock (see. Sauces) ; 
skim it when it boils, adding two bay leaves, a little garlic, 
some onions, mushrooms or mushroom powder, celery, car- 
rots, half a cabbage ; turnips, a bundle of sweet herbs, whole 
pepper, mace, and allspice: in this let the cheek stew till 
nearly done, and having cut the string, put the cheek in a 
clean stevvpan; in the meantime strain the gravy, skim clean, 
season with lemon juice, cayenne, and salt : add two spoons- 
ful of browning, clear the whole with eggs, and when cleared, 
strain through a tamis over the cheek in the clean stewpan, 
and stew till tender. 

Beef Tails. 

HAVING cut them into joints, blanch and wash them : put 
them in a stewpan with a sufficient quantity of stock, and 
braise till tender: drain them, and serve with haricot sauce 
over them. See Sauces. 

Beef Escarlot. 

TAKE a brisket of beef, half a pound of coarse sugar, tw 
ounces of bay salt, and a pound of common salt. Mix all to- 
gether, rub the beef with it, lay it in an earthen pan, and turn 
it every day. It may lie a fortnight in this pickle : then serve 
it up with savoys or pease pudding, but -it eats much better 
when cold and cut into slices. 

Beef Palates. 

BLANCH, peel, and broil the palates; trim them into the 
shape of cutlets ; braize with a pint of veal stock till nearly- 
all is reduced : serve with allemand sauce. See Sauces, 

Beef Palates baked (brown). 

HAVING blanched, peeled, and boiled the palates, line a tin 
mould with a veal caul ; lay a palate upon it, and over it some 
light forcemeat containing green truffles pounded : fill the 
mould with alternate layers of caul, palates, and forcemeat : 
add a sufficient quantity of sto~k, and bake in a moderate 
oven : take out the palates, &c. and put aside the cauls ; lay 
the palates in the dish with the forcemeat over each : strain the 
gravy, skim off the fat, add two spoonsful of port wine, one of 
browning, and four pf Spanish sauce (see Sauces) boil all 
together, and pour it over the palates.

. Beef Palates baked (white) . 

WHEN the palates come out of the oven, strain the gravy 
and skim off the fat, adding a leasori (see Sauces) of two yolks 
of eggs, and two spoonsful of benshamelle. 

Tripe a la Kilkenny. 

THIS dish is very much admired in Ireland, and is thus pre- 
pared: take a piece of double tripe cut in square pieces, and 
two cow-heels also cut in pieces. Peel and wash ten large 
onions, cut them in two, and boil in water till tender. Then 
put in your tripe and cow-heels, and boil it ten minutes. Pour 
off almost all your liquor, shake a little flour into it, and put 
in some butter, with a little salt and mustard. Shake all over 
the tire till the butter is melted, then put it into your dish, and 
send it to table as hot as possible. 

Tongue roasted. 

LET the tongue, if a dried one, be soaked in water for at 
least four days, changing the water daily : if a green tongue 
fresh out of pickle, twenty-four hours will be sufficient : in 
either of these cases, the tongue must be simmered in water 
till tender, and the skin can be easily taken off: if a fresh 
tongue is used, blanch it till the skin can be easily taken off: 
scrape, trim neatly, and wash clean : make several incisions 
with a sharp knife, and fill with a savory forcemeat (see 
Sauces) : cover with a veal caul, and tie on a spit: when do.ie, 
take off the caul, wipe dry ; glaze, and serve with stewed 
spinage under it. See Stewing. 

Cold roasted Tongue and Barberries. 

PUT into a stewpan half a pint of sauce tournay (see Sauces ), 
and two spoonsful of preserved barberries : when these have 
boiled up, add slices of cold roasted tongue, letting them re- 
main in the sauce till thoroughly warm ; and serve with the 
barberries in the middle of the dish. 

Hodge Podge. 

TAKE half a pound of pickled pork, half a pound of brisket 
of beef, each cut into two pieces, and four beef tails cut into 
joints* having put them into a pot and covered them with 
water, boil : then skim clean, and add two ounces of dried 
mushrooms, turnips, carrots, onions, Igeks, celery, all cut 
small, and kitchen pepper (see Sauces) : when the liquor is 
nearly consumed, add two quarts of veal stock, and stew the 



96 MADE DISHES. 

meat till tender, when it is to be taken up, and the gravy 
strained from the vegetables and skimmed : add browning two 
spoonsful, and cayenne, salt, and lemon-juice to the palate : 
in the meantime, cut turnips and carrots into shapes, and 
celery into lengths about two inches ; sweat them in a stew- 
pan till quite tender, and strain their liquor to the gravy ob- 
tained from the meat : now put in the meat, simmer till 
thoroughly hot, add the vegetables which have been sweated, 
and serve. 

Porcupine of a Breast of Veal. 

TAKE the finest and largest breast of veal you can procure, 
bone, and rub it over with the yolks of two eggs. Spread on 
a table, and lay over it a little bacon cutas thin as possible, a 
handful of parsley shred fine, the yolks of five hard-boiled 
eggs chopped small, a little lemon peel cut fine, grated bread 
steeped in cream, and season to your taste with salt, pepper, 
and nutmeg. Roll the breast close, and skewer it up. Then 
cut fat bacon, and the lean of ham that has been a little 
boiled (if you use the ham raw, it will turn the veal red), and 
pickled cucumbers, about two inches long, to answer the 
other lardings. Lard it in rows, first ham, then bacon, and 
then cucumbers, till you have larded every part of the veal. 
Put it in a deep earthen pot, with a pint of water, and cover 
it, and set it in a slow oven for two hours. As soon as it 
comes from the oven, skim off the fat, and strain the gravy 
through a sieve into astewpan. Put in a glass of white wine, 
a little lemon pickle and caper liquor, and a spoonful of 
mushroom ketchup. Thicken it with a little butter rolled in 
flour, lay your porcupine on the dish, and pour it hot upon 
it ; and serve with forcemeat balls round it. 

Shoulder of Veal a la Haut-gout. 

CUT off the knuckle and flaps of a shoulder of veal ; raise 
the skin, leaving it fast at the knuckle, and lard all over with 
fat and lean bacon, seasoning with white pepper and salt: 
rub the larding with the yolk of an egg, and sprinkle it wkh 
grated bread, parsley, pickled mushrooms, a little lemon peel, 
and green truffles, all shred very fine : skewer the skin over 
these, and put the veal in a stewpan with fresh butter: stew till 
of a light brown, frequently turning the meat ; then add a quart 
of weak stock (see Sauces) , a spoonful of ketchup, the same of 
garlic vinegar, and a glass of white wine : stew till sufficiently 
tender; take up the veal, strain and skim the gravy, to which 
add forcemeat balls, fresh mushrooms, truffles, and morels : 
give these a boil, put in the veal for a few minutes, and 
serve, having previously removed the skin.

Veal a la Bourgeoise. 

HAV ING cut veal into thick slices, lard them with bacon, 
and season their, \\itb kitchen pepper (sec Sauces) and chop- 
ped parsley. Cover the bottom of your stewpan with slices 
of fat bacon, lay the veal upon them, cover the pan; and set it 
over the tire for eight or ten minutes, just to be hot, and no 
more. Then, with a brisk fire, brown your veal on both 
sides, and shake some flour over it : add a quart of veal 
stock, cover close, and stew gently till enough. Then take 
out the slices of bacon, and skim ail the fat oft' clean, and 
add a leason of eggs and a spoonful of benshamelle to the 
gravy. Mix all together, and stir one way till it is smooth 
and thick, and serve^with the sai'ice over the meat. 

Roasted Loin of Veal a la Benshamelle. 

TAKE a cold roasted loin of veal, or a part of one that has 
been already served at table; and having poured a little 
melted butter over it, paper, and put it into an oven till 
warm through : take it out ; and having cut out the underside 
or fillet, mince the same, adding Benshamelle (see SaucesJ, 
a little garlic vinegar, white pepper, lemon, salt, and a smaJl 
lump of sugar : simmer in a small stewpan ; take up the 
mince, and put it into the place from whence you cut it; 
sprinkle over it a little grated bread, and pour over it some 
clarified butter: put the veal, with the mince upwards, into 
an oven to brown ; and serve with benshamelle sauce under 
it. A cold neck may be done in the same manner. 

Neck of Veal larded. 

TKIM the veal neatly, taking off the under part of the bone, 
and leaving only a part of the long bones: lard with fat ba- 
con, cover with a veal caul, and roast gently till nearly done : 
take off the caul, roast till sufficiently done, wipe dry, glaize

the same forcemeat, rubbing them smooth with a raw egg. 
Make them of the height and bigness of a French roll, and 
throw a little fine grated bread over them. Bake them three 
quarters, or an hour, in a gentle oven, or under a baking 
cover, till they come to a fine brown, and place them on 
your mazarine, that they may not touch one another; but 
place them so that they may not fall flat in the baking ; or you 
may form them on your table with a broad kitchen knife, and 
place them on the thing you intend to bake them on. You 
may put the leg of a chicken into one of the loaves you in- 
tend for the middle. Let your sauce be gravy, thickened with 
butter, and a little jaice of lemon.

CHAPTER XV. 



SOUPS AND BROTHS. 

PRELIMINARY HINTS AND OBSERVATIONS. 

I AKE great care that your pots? saucepans, and covers, are 
very clean, and free from all sand and grease, and that they 
are properly tinned ; since, if this be not cautiously attended 
to, your soups and broths will not only acquire a bad taste, 
but become pernicious to the health and constitutions of 
many. When you make any kind of soup, particularly ver- 
micelli, portable or brown gravy soups, or any other soups 
that have herbs or roots in them, be sure to remember to lay 
your meat at the bottom of the pan, with a large piece of 
butter. Then cut the roots and herbs small, and having laid 
them over your meat, cover your pot or saucepan very close, 
and keep under it a slow fire, which will draw all the virtues 
out of the vegetables, turn them to a good gravy, and give 
the soup a very different flavour from what it would have by 
a contrary conduct. When your gravy is almost dried up, 
replenish it with water ; and when it begins to boil, take off 
the fat, and follow the directions given you for the particular 
kind of soup or broth you are making. Soft water will suit 



1GO SOUPS. 

your purpose best in making old peas soup; but when you 
make soup of green peas, you must make use of hard water, 
as it will the better preserve the colour of your peas. In the 
preparation of white soup, remember never to put in your 
cream till you take your soup off the fire, and the last thing 
you do, must be the dishing of your soups. Gravy soup will 
have a skin over it by standing; and from the same eause peas 
soup will often settle, and look thin at the top. Lastly, let 
the ingredients of your soups and broths be so properly pro- 
portioned, that they may not taste of one thing more than 
another, but that the taste be equal, and the whole of a fine 
and agreeable relish. 

Soup a la Reine. 

PUT three quarts of water to a knuckle' of veal and three 
or four pounds of beef, with a little salt, and when it boils, 
skim it well. Then put in a leek, a little thyme, some par- 
sley, a head pr two of celery, a parsnip^ two large carrots, 
and six large onions, and boil all together till the goodness is 
quite out of the meat : strain through a hair sieve, and let it 
stand about an hour: skim it well, and clear it off gently from 
the settlings into a clean pan : boil half a pint of cream, pour 
it on the crumb of a halfpenny loaf, and let it soak well. 
Take half a pound of almonds, blanch arid beat them as fine 
as possible, putting in now and then a little cream to prevent 
their oiling: then take the yolks of six hard eggs, and the 
roll that was soaked in the cream, and beat them all together 
quite fine : make your broth hot, and pour it to your almonds, 
strain it through a tamis, rubbing it with a spoon till all the 
goodness is gone quite through into a stewpan : add more 
cream to make it white, and set it over the fire. Keep 
stirring it till it boils, skim off the froth as it rises, and soak 
the tops of French rolls in melted butter In a stewpan till they 
are crisp, but not brown : take them out, and lay them on a 
plate before the fire ; and, about a quarter of an hour before 
you send it to table, take a little of the hot soup, and put it 
to the rolls in the bottom of the tureen. Put your soup on 
the fire, keep stirring it till it nearly boils, and then pour it 
into your tureen, and serve it up hot. Be careful to take otf 
all the fat of the broth before you pour it to the almonds, or 
they will curdle and spoil it. 

Soup and Bauillie. 

To make the bouillie, roll five pounds of brisket cf beef 
tight with a tape ; put it into a stewpot, with four pounds of 
the leg of mutton piece of beef, and about seven or eight 



SOUPS. 161 

quarts of water. Boil these up as quick as possible, and skim 
it very clean ; add one large onion, six or seven cloves, some 
whole pepper, two or three carrots, or a turnip or two, a leek

ner, strain the soup through a tamis cloth. Have ready boiled 
carrots cut like wheels, turnips cut in balls, spinach, a little 
chervil and sorrel, two heads of endive, and one or two of 
celery cut into pieces. Put these into a tureen, with a Dutch

part of the mutton, a turnip or two, a few chives chopped 
fine, and a little parsley chopped small. Put these in about 
a quarter of an hour before your broth is enough, and season 
with salt. A quarter of a pound of barley or rice may be 
added. 

Portable Soup. 

THIS is a very useful soup for travellers, and must be made 
thus: cut into small pieces three large legs of veal, one of 
beef, and the lean part of half a ham. Put a quarter of a 
pound of butter at the bottom of a large stewpot, and lay in 
the meat and bones, with four ounces of anchovie^ and two 
ounces of mace ; cut off the green leaves of five or six heads 
of celery, wash them quite clean, and cut them small. Put 
in these, with three large carrots cut thin, and cover the 
stewpot close. Put it over a moderate fire, and when you 
find the gravy begin to draw, take it up till you have got it 
all out: cover the meat with water, set it on the fire again, 
and let it boil four hours slowly : strain through a tamis into 
a clean stewpan, and let it boil three parts away : strain the 
gravy drawn from the meat into the pan, and let it boil gently 
till of the consistence of glue, observing to keep skimming 
off the fat clean as it rises. Great care must be taken, when 
nearly enough, that it do not burn. Season it to your taste 
with cayenne, and pour it into flat earthen dishes a quarter 
of an inch thick. Let it stand till the next day, skim off all 
the fat, and then cut it out by round tins a little larger than

a crown piece. Lay the cakes in dishes, and set them in the 
sun to dry, and be careful to keep turning them often. When 
the cakes are dry, put them in a tin hox, with writing-paper 
between every cake, and keep them in a dry place. This 
soup should be made in frosty weather. By pouring a pint of 
boiling water on one cake, and a little salt, it will make a good 
bason'of broth ; and a little boiling water poured on it will 
make gravy for a turkey or fowls. It possesses one valuable 
quality, that of losing none of its virtues by keeping. 

Gravy Soup. 

TAKE a shin of beef, and put it into six quarts of water, 
with a pint of peas, and six onions Set it over the fire, and 
let it boil gently till all the juice is out of the meat: strain

a stewpan to reduce to half the quantity. Season to your 
taste with pepper and salt, and put in a little celery and beet 
leaves, arid boil till tender.

parsnip, and season the whole with pepper and mace to your 
taste. Stew all these verv gently together, till the pulp will 
force through a sieve. Have ready a handful of beet-leaves 
and root, some celerv and spinach, which must be first 
blanched and stewed tender in the strained liquor. Have

celery cut small and washed clean, a bundle of sweet herbs, a 
large onion, a ml a little parsley chopped fine. Let this boil 
an hour, and take a large fowl clean picked and washed, and 
put it into the pot: boil it till the broth is quite good, theii 
season it with salt to your taste. Take out the onion and 
sweet herbs, and send it to table with the fowl in the middle: 
or you may omit the fowl, as it will be very good without it. 

This broth is sometimes made with a sheep's head instead 
of a leg of beef, and is very good; but in this case you must 
chop the head all to pieces. Six pounds of the thick flank, in 
six quarts of water, make good broth. Put in the barley 
with the meat, first skim it well, and boil it an hour very 
softly. Then put in the above ingredients, with turnips and 
carrots clean scraped and pared, and cut in little pieces. Boil

and carrots round, and pour the broth over all.

almonds, and a little of the juice: strain it through a coarse 
sieve, mix all together, and let it boil up, Cut some slices of 
French bread, and dry them before the fire. Soak them a little 
in the milk, lay them at the bottom of the tureen, and then 
pour in the soup. 

Milk Soup the Dutch way. 

BOIL a quart of milk with cinnamon and moist sugar. Put 
sippets into the dish, pour the milk over it, and set it over a 
charcoal fire to simmer till the bread is soft. Take the yolks 
of two eggs, beat them up, mix it with a little of the milk, 
and throw it in : mix all together, and send it up to table. 

Rice Soup. 

PUT a pound of rice, and a little cinnamon, into two quarts 
of water. Cover close, and simmer very softly till the rice is 
quite tender. Take out the cinnamon, then sweeten it to the 
palate, grate half a nutmeg, and let it stand till it is cold : 
beat up the yolks of three eggs, with half a pint of white 
wine, mix them very well and stir them into the rice. Set 
them on a slow fire, and keep stirring all the time for fear of 
curdling. When of a good thickness, and boiling, take it up. 
Keep stirring it till it is put into the dish. 

Turnip Soup. 

PARE a bunch of turnips, save three or four out, and put the 
rest into a gallon of water, with half an ounce of whole pep- 



SOUPS. 173 

per, an onion stuck with cloves, a blade of mace, half a nut- 
meg bruised, a bundle of sweet herbs, and a large crust of 
bread. Let these boil an hour pretty fast, then strain it through 
a sieve, squeezing- the turnips through. Wash and cut a 
bunch of celery very small, set it on in the liquor on the fire, 
cover it close, and let it stew. In the meantime, cut the tur- 
nips you saved into dice, and two or three small carrots clean 
scraped, and cut into little pieces. Put half these turnips and 
carrots into the pot with the celery, and the other half fry 
brown in fresh butter, flouring them first; then two or three 
onions peeled, cut into thin slices and fried J>r own : put all 
into the soup, with one ounce of vermicelli. Let the soup boil 
softly till the celery is quite tender, and the s<Sup good. Sea- 
son with salt to the palate. 

Egg Soup. 

HAVING beaten the yolks of two eggs in a dish, with a piece 
of butter as big as a hen's egg, take a tea-kettle of boiling 
water in one hand, and a spoon in the other. Pour in about a 
quart by degrees, then keep stirring it all the time well till 
the eggs are well mixed, and the butter melted : pour it into 
a saucepan, and keep stirring it all the time till it begins to sim- 
mer: take it off the fire, and pour it between two vessels, out 
of one into another, till it is quite smooth, and has a great 
froth. Set it on the fire again, keep stirring it till quite hot, 
then pour it into the soup-dish, and send it hot to table. 

Cray-fish Soup. 

TAKE half a hundred of fresh craw-fish, boil them, and pick 
out all the meat, which must be carefully saved: take a 
fresh lobster and pick out all the meat, which must be like- 
wise saved : pound the shells of the lobster and cray-fish fine 
in a marble mortar, and boil them in four quarts of water, 
with four pounds of mutton, a pint of green split peas nicely / 
picked and. washed, a large turnip, carrot, onion, an anchovy, 
mace, cloves, a little thyme, pepper, and salt. Stew them on 
a slow fire, till the goodness is out of the mutton and the 
shells, and strain it through a sieve. Then put in the tails 
of the cray-fish and the lobster meat, cut in very small pieces, 
with the red coral of the lobster, If it has any. Boil half an 
hour, and just before serving it up, put to it a little butter 
melted thick and smooth. Stir it round several times, take 
care not to make it too strong of the spice, and send it up 
hot. 



174 SOUPS. 



Oyster Soup. 

TAKE what quantity may be wanted of fish-stock ; then take 
two quarts of oysters bearded, and beat them in a mortar, with 
the yolks of ten e-gs boiled hard. Put them to the fish-stock, 
and set it over the fire. Season with pepper, salt, and grated 
nutmeg, and when it boils, put in the eggs and oysters. Let 
it boil till it be of a good thickness, and like a fine cream. 

Eel Soup. 

TAKE a pound of eels, which will make a pint of good 
soup, or any greater weight of eels, in proportion to the quan- 
tity of soup intended to be made ; to every poui^d of eels put 
a quart of water, a crust of bread, two or three blades of mace, 
a little whole pepper, an onion, and a bundle of sweet herbs. 
Cover them close, and let them boil till half the liquor is 
wasted. Then strain it, and toast some bread ; cut it small, 
lay the bread into the dish, and pour in the soup. 

Muscle Soup. 

WASH an hundred of muscles very clean, put them into a 
stewpan, and cover them close. Let theifi stew till they open ; 
then pick them out of the shells, strain 'the liquor through a 
fine lawn sieve to your muscles, and pick out the beard or 
crab, if any. Take a dozen crayfish, beat them fine with a 
dozen of almonds blanched, and beat fine: then take a small 
parsnip, and a carrot scraped, and cut it into thin slices, and 
fry them brown with a little butter : take two pounds of any 
fresh fish, and boil them in a gallon of water, with a bundle of 
sweet herbs, a large onion stuck with cloves, whole black and 
white pepper, a little parsley, and a little piece of horse-ra- 
dish. Let them boil till half is wasted, and strain them through 
a sieve. Put the soup into a saucepan, twenty of the mus- 
cles, a few mushrooms and truffles cut small, and a leek 
washed and cut very small. Take two French rolls, take out 
the crumb, fry it brown, cut it into little pieces, and put it 
into the soup. Boil it altogether for a quarter of an hour, 
with the fried carrot and parsnip. In the meantime, take the 
crust of the rolls fried crisp ; take half a hundred of the mus- 
cles, a quarter of a pound of butter, a spoonful of water, shake 
in it a little flour, and set them on the fire, keeping the sauce- 
pan shaking all the time till the butter is melted. Season with 
pepper and salt, beat the yolks of three e^gs, put them in, 
tir them all the time for fear of curdling, and grate in a little

oup into the dish, put in the rolls, and lay the rest of the mus- 
;les round the rim of the dish. 

Skate or Thornback Soup. 

SKIN and boil two pounds of skate or thornback in six

CHAPTER XVI. 
ROOTS AND VEGETABLES. 

PRELIMINARY HINTS AND OBSERVATIONS. 

HE very careful that your greens are nicely picked and 
washed, and when so done, alwaj's lay them in a clean pan, 
for fear of sand and dust, which is apt to hang round wooden 
i-essels. Boil all your greens in a well-tinned copper saucepan 
by themselves, and be sure to let them have plenty of water. 
Boil no kind of meat with them, as that will discolour them ; 
and use no iron pans, sucb being very improper for the pur- 
pose, but let them be either copper or br&ss well tinned ; or 
silver. Numbers of cooks spoil their garden stufls by boiling 
them too much. All kinds of vegetables should have a little 
crispness; for if you boil them too much) you will deprive 
them both of their sweetness and beauty. 

N. B. A tea-spoonful of American pearl -ash thrown into 
the water, will boil greens of a much finer colour than salt ; 
and it is besides, perfectly wholesome. 



VEGETABLES. 



Cabbages. 

ALL sorts of cabbages and young sprouts must have plenty 
of water allowed them to boil in, and when the stalks become 
tender, or fall to the bottom, it is a proof of their being suf- 
ficiently boiled. Then take them off before they lose their 
colour ; but remember always to throw some salt into the 
water before the greens are put in. Send the young sprouts 
to table whole as they come out of the pot; but many people 
think cabbage is best chopped, and put into a saucepan, with 
a. piece of butter, stirring it about for five or six minutes, till 
the butter is all melted, then empty it on a dish, and serve it 



up. 

Turnips. 

TURNIPS may be boiled in the pot with the meat, and in- 
deed eat best when so done. When they are enough, take 
them out, put them into a pan, mash them with butter and a 
little salt, and in that state ^end them to table. Another me- 
thod of boiling them is as follows : pare the turnips, and cut 
them into little square pieces of the size of dice : put them 
into a saucepan, and just cover them over with water. As 
soon as they are enough, take them off the fire, and throw 
them into a sieve to drain. Put them into a saucepan, with a 
good piece of butter, stir them over the fire for a few minutes, 
and they will then be fit for the table. 

Potatoes. 

THOUGH greens require plenty of water to be boiled in, 
potatoes must have only a quantity sufficient to keep the 
saucepan from burning. Keep them close covered, and as soon 
as the skins begin to crack, they will be enough. Having 
drained out all the water, let them stand covered for a minute 
or two. 

Scolloped Potatoes. 

HAVING boiled the potatoes, beat them fine in a marble 
mortar, with some cream, a large piece of butter, and a little 
salt : put them into scollop shells, make them smooth on the 
top, score them with a knife, and lay thin slices of butter on 
the top of them. Then put them into a Dutch oven to brown 
before the fire. 

Spinach. 

HAVING picked the spinach very clean, and washed it in 
five or six waters, put it into a saucepan that will just hold 



VEGETABLES. 177 

it, throw a little salt over it, and cover it close : put in no 
water, but take care to shake the pan often. Put the sauce- 
pan on a clear and quick fire, and as soon as the greens are 
shrunk and fallen to the bottom, and the liquor that comes out 
of them boils up, it is a proof the spinach is enough. Throw 
them into a clean sieve to drain, and just give them a gentle 
squeeze; lay them on a plate, and send them, up with butter 
in a boat, but never pour any over them. 

Carrots. 

SCRAPE the carrots very clean, put them into the pot, and 
when they are enough take them out, and rub them in a clean 
cloth, then slice them into a plate. If young' spring carrots, 
half an hour will boil them sufficiently ; if large, they will re- 
quire an hour; and old Sandwich carrots will take two hours 
boiling. 

French Beans. 

STRING the beans, cut them in two, and then across: or, 
cut them into four, and then aci'ossyso that each bean will 
then be in eight pieces. Put them into salt and water, and 
when the pan boils, put them in with a little salt. They will 
be soon done, which may be known by their becoming tender: 
but take care not to suffer them to lose their fine green colour. 

French Beans ragooed* 

STRING a quarter of a peck of French beans, but do not 
split them. Cut them across in three parts, and lay them in 
salt and water: take them out, and dry them in a coarse 
cloth ; then fry them brown, pour out all the fat, and put in 
a quarter of a pint of hot water. Stir it into the pan by de- 
grees, ami let it boil. Then take a quarter of a pound of fresh 
butter rolled in a little flour, two spoonsful of ketchup, a 
spoonful of mushroom pickle, four spoonsful of white wine, 
an onion stuck with six cloves, two or three blades of mace 
beaten, half a nutmeg grated, and a little pepper and salt. 
Stir it all together for a few minutes, and then throw in the 
beans. Shake the pan for a minute or two, take out the onions, 
and pour all into your dish. 

French Beans ragoocd with a Force. 

HAVING made a ragoo of beans as above directed, take two 
large carrots, scrape them, and then boil them tender. Then 
mash them in a pan, and season them with pepper and salt. 
Mix them with a little piece of butter, and two eggs. Mak$

it into any shape, and bake it a quarter of an hour in a quick 
oven ; but a tin oven is the best. Lay it in the middle of the 
dish, and the ragoo round it. 

Cauliflowers. 

CUT off all the green part from the cauliflowers, then cut 
the flowers into four, and lay them into water for an hour: 
then have some milk and water boiling; put in the cauli- 
flowers, and be sure to skim the saucepan well. When the 
stalks are tender, take up the (lowers carefully, and put them 
into a cullender to drain. Then put a spoonful of water into 
a clean stewpan, with a little dust of flour, about a quarter of 
a pound of butter, and shake it round till it is all finely melted 
with a little pepper and salt. Then take half the cauliflower, 
and cut it as for pickling. Lay it into the stewpan, turn it, 
and shake the pan round. Ten minutes will do it. Lay the 
stewed in the middle of the dish, and the boiled round it, 
and pour over it the butter. 

Or, cauliflowers may be dressed in this manner: cut the 
stalks off, leave a little gfcpen on, and boil them in spring water 
and salt, for about fifteen minutes. Take them out and drain 
them, and send them up whole, with some melted butter in a 
boat. 

Asparagus. 

HAVING scraped all the stalks very carefully till they look 
white, cut all the stalks even alike, throw them into water, 
and have ready a stewpan boiling. Put in some salt, and tie 
the asparagus in little bunches. Let the water keep boiling, 
and when they are a little tender take them up. If boiled too 
much they will lose both their colour and taste. Cut a round 
of a small loaf, about half an inch thick, and toast it brown on 
both sides. Then dip it in the liquor the asparagus was boiled 
in, and lay it in the dish. Pour a little butter over the toast, 
then lay the asparagus on the toast all round the dish, with the 
white tops outwards. 

Asparagus forced in French Rolls. 

CiPr a piece out of the crust of the tops of three French 
rolls, and take out all their crumb ; but be careful that the 
crusts fit again in their places from whence they were taken. 
Fry the rolls brown in fresh butter. Then take a pint of 
cream, the yolks of six eggs beat fine, and a little salt and nut- 
meg : stir well together over a slow fire till it begins to be 
thick. Have ready a hundred of small grass boiled, and save 
tops enough to stick the rolls with. Cut the rest of the tops 



VEGETABLES. 179 

small, put them into the cream, and fill the rolls with them. 
Before frying the rolls, make holes thick in the top crusts, to 
stick the grass in. Then lay on the pieces of crust, and stick 
the grass in, that it may look as if it were growing. 

Parsnips. 

PARSNIPS must be boiled in plenty of water; and when 
they become soft, which may be known by running a fork 
into them, take them up, and carefully scrape all the dirt off 
them. Then scrape them all fine with a knife, throwing away 
all the sticky part, and send them up plain in a dish with melted 
butter. 

Brocoli. 

CAREFULLY strip off all the little branches but the top one, 
and then with a knife peel off all the hard outside skin that is 
on the stalks and little branches, and then throw them into 
water. Have ready a stewpan of water, throw in a little 
salt, and when it boils, put in the brocoli. When the stalks 
are tender, it will be enough. Put a piece of toasted bread, 
soaked in the water the brocoli was boiled in, at the bottom 
of the dish, and put the brocoli on the top of it, in the same 
way as asparagus, and send it up to table with butter in a boat. 

Windsor Beans. 

THESE must be boiled in plenty of water, with a good quan- 
tity of salt. Boil and chop some parsley, put it into good 
melted butter, and serve them up. 

Green Peas. 

THE peas must not be shelled till just before they are 
wanted : put them into boiling water, with a little salt and a 
lump of loaf sugar, and when they begin to dent in the mid- 
dle, they will be enough. Strain them into a sieve, put a good 
lump of butter into the dish, and stir them till the butter is 
melted. Boil a sprig of mint by itself, chop it fine, and lay 
it round edge of the dish in lumps. 

Peas Francoise. 

SHELL a quart of peas, cut a large Spanish onion small, 
and two cabbage or Silesia lettuces N Put to them half a pint 
of water with a little salt and a little pepper, mace, and nut- 
meg, all beaten. Cover them close, and let them stew a 
quarterljf an hour. Then put in a quarter of a pound of fresh 

N2 



1 80 VEGETABLES. 

butter rolled in a little flour, a spoonful of ketchup, and at 
piece of burnt butter of the size of a nutmeg. Cover them 
close, and simmer a quarter of an hour, observing frequently 
to shake the pan. 

Endive ragoocd. 

LAY three heads of fine white endive in salt and water for 
two or three hours. Then take a hundred of asparagus, and 
cut off the green heads ; then chop the rest small, as far as it 
is tender, and lay it in salt and water. Take a bunch of 
celery, wash it and scrape it clean, and cut it in pieces about 
three inches long. Put it into a saucepan with a pint of 
water, three or four blades of mace, and some white pepper 
tied in a rag. Let it stew till quite tender, then put in the 
asparagus, shake the saucepan, and let it simmer till the grass 
is enough. Take the endive out of the water, drain it, and 
leave one large head whole. Take the other leaf by leaf, put 
it into the stewpan, and put to it a pint of white wine. Cover 
the pan close, and let it boil till the endive is just enough : 
then add a quarter of a pound of butter rolled in flour, cover 
the pan close, and keep it shaking. When the endive is 
enough, take it up, and lay the whole head in the middle : with 
a spoon take out the celery and grass, and lay them round it, 
and the other part of the endive over that. Then pour the 
liquor out of the saucepan into the stewpan, stir it together, 
and season it with salt. Have ready the yolks of two eggs 
beat up with a quarter of a pint of cream, and half a nutmeg 
grated in. Mix this Avith the sauce, keep it stirring one way 
till it is thick, and pour it over the ragoo. 

Force-meagre Cabbage. 

BOIL a white-heart cabbage, as big as the bottom of a plate, 
five minutes in water: drain it, cut the stalk flat to stand in 
the dish, and carefully open the leaves, and take out the in- 
side, leaving the outside leaves whole. Chop what is taken 
out very fine, and take the flesh of two or three flounders or 
plaice clean from th* bone. Chop it with the cabbage, the 
yolks and whites of four eggs boiled hard, and a handful of 
pickled parsley. Beat all together in a mortar, with a quarter 
of a pound of melted butter. Then mix it up with the yolk 
of an egg, and a few crumbs of bread. Fill the cabbage, and 
tie it together; put it into a deep stewpan or saucepan, and 
put to it half a pint of water, a quarter of a pound of butter 
lolled in a little flour, the yolks of four eggs boiled hard, an 
onion stuck with six cloves, some whole pepper and mace tied 
in a muslin rag, half an ounce of truffles and morels, a spoon- 



PUDDINGS. 181 



ful of ketchup, and a few pickled mushrooms. Corer it close, 
and let it simmer an hour; if not sufficiently done in that 
time, let it simmer longer : when done, take out the onion 
and spice, lay it in the dish, untie it, and pour the sauce over 
it. 



CHAPTER XVII. 
PUDDINGS. 

PRELIMINARY HINTS AND OBSERVATIONS. 

\VHEN you boil a pudding, take particular care that your 
cloth is clean, and remember to dip it in boiling water ; flour 
it well, and give it a shake, before you put your pudding into 
it. If it be a bread pudding tie it loose, but close if a batter 
pudding. If you boil it in a bason, butter it, and boil it in. 
plenty of water. Turn it often, and do not cover the pan ; 
and whe/i enough, take it up in the bason, and let it stand a 
few minutes to cool. Then untie the string, clap the cloth 
round the bason, lay your dish orer it, and turn the pudding 
out ; then take off the bason and cloth very carefully, light 
puddings being apt to break. When you make a batter pud- 
ding, first mix the flour well with a little milk, then put in 
the ingredients by degrees, and it will be smooth and not 
lumpy ; but for a plain batter pudding, the best way is to strain 
it through a coarse hair sieve, that it may neither have lumps, 
nor the treadles of the eggs ; and for all other puddings, strain 
the eggs when you beat them. Bread and custard puddings 
for baking, require time and a moderate oven to raise them ; 
batter and rice puddings a quick oven, and always remember 
to butter the pan or dish before you put your pudding into 
jt. 

Steak Pudding. 

HAVING made a good crust, with flour and suet shred fine, 
and mixed it up with cold water, season it with a little salt, 
and make a pretty stiff crust, in the proportion of two pounds 
pf suet to a quarter of a peck of flour. Take either beef or 
mutton steaks, well season them with pepper and salt, and 
make it up in the same manner as an apple pudding ; tie it 
in a cloth, and put it in when the water boils. If a small pud- 
ding, it will be boiled in three hours, but a large one will take 
Jive hours. 



PUDDINGS. 



Calf's Foot Pudding. 

MINCE very fine a pound of calves' feet, first taking out the 
fat and brown. Then take a pound and a half of suet, 
pick off all the skin, and shred it small. Take six eggs, all 
the yolks, and but half the whites, and beat them well. Then 
take the crumb of a halfpenny roll grated, a pound of currants 
clean picked aad washed, and rubbed in a cloth, as much 
milk as will moisten it with the eggs, a handful of flour, a 
little salt, nutmeg, and sugar, to season it to the palate. Boil 
it nine hours. ^Then take it up, lay it in the dish, and pour 
melted butter over it. White wine and sugar may be put into 
the butter, and it will be a very great improvement. 

Yorkshire Pudding. 

THIS pudding is usually baked under meat, and is thus made : 
beat four large spoonsful of fine flour with four eggs, and a 
little sak, for fifteen minutes. Then put to them three pints 
of milk, and mix them well together. Then butter a drip- 
ping-pan, and set it under beef, mutton, or a loin of veal, 
when roasting. When it is brown, cut it into square pieces, 
and turn it over; and when the under side is browned also, 
send it to table on a dish. 

Hunting Pudding. 

Mix eight eggs beat up fine with a pint of good cream, and 
a pound of flour. Beat them well together, and put to them 
a pound of beef suet finely chopped, a pound of currants well 
cleaned, half a pound of jar raisins stoned and chopped small, 
two ounces of candied orange cut small, the same of candied 
citron, a quarter of a pound of powdered sugar, and a large 
nutmeg grated. Mix all together with half a gill of brandy, 
put it into a cloth, tie it up close, and boil it. four hours. 

Marrow Pudding. 

GRATE a penny loaf into crumbs, and pour on them a pint 
of boiling hot cream. Cut very thin a pound of beef marrow, 
beat four eggs well, and then add a glass of brandy, with 
sugar and nutmeg to the taste. Mix them all well together, 
and then boil or bake it. Three quarters of an hour will do 
it. Cut two ounces of citron very thin, and when it is served, 
stick them all over it. 

Or, having laid a thin paste in the dish, take some cream, 
the yolks and whites of eight eggs beat up in rose water, some 



PUDDINGS. 183 

sugar, and a little nutmeg. Mix them all together. Rasp 
some stale French rolls, and cut them in thin slices. Take 
a quarter of a pound of currants washed, picked, and dried ; 
put a layer of bread in the dish, strew some currants and 
marrow sliced over it, then some custard, and so on alternately 
until the dish is full. The dish must not be very deep. 
After it is boiled, strew sugar over it. 

Plum Pudding boiled, 

CUT a pound of suet into little pieces, but not too fine, a 
pound of currants washed clean, a pound of raisins stoned, 
eight yolks of eggs, and four whites, half a' r nutmeg grated, 
a tea-spoonful of beaten ginger, a pound of flourf and a pint of 
rnilk. Beat the eggs first, then put to them half the milk, 
and beat them together, and by degrees stir in the flour, then 
the suet, spice, and fruit, as much milk as will mix it well 
together very thick. It will take five hours boiling. 

Oxford Pudding. 

TAKE a quarter of a pound of grated biscuits, the same 
quantity of currants clean washed and picked, the same of 
suef shred small, half a large spoonful of powdered sugar, a 
little salt, and some grated nutmeg. Mix them all well toge- 
ther, and take two yolks of eggs, and make them up into 
balls of the size of a turkey's egg. Fry them of a fine light 
brown, in fresh butter, and let the sauce be melted butter and 
sugar, with a little white wine put into it. 

Custard Pudding. 

FROM a pint of cream take two or three spoonsful, and 
mix them with a spoonful of fine flour. Set the rest of the 
cream on the fire to boil, and as soon as it is boiled, take it off, 
and stir it in the cold cream and flour very well. When cool 
beat up five yolks and two whites of eggs, and stir in a little 
salt and some nutmeg, two or three spoonsful of sack, and 
sweeten to the palate : butter a bason, and pour it into it, tie 
a cloth over it, and boil it half an hour. Then take it out, 
untie the cloth, turn the pudding into the dish, and pour on 
it melted butter. 

Sweetmeat Pudding. 

COVER the dish with,a thin puff paste, then take candied 
orange, lemon peel, and citron, of each an ounce. Slice them 
thin, and lay them all over the bottom of the dish. Then 



184 PUDDINGS. 

beat eight yolks of eggs and two whites, near Haifa pound of 
'sugar, and half a pound of melted butter. Beat all veil toge- 
ther, pour in all the sweetmeats, and bake it something less 
than an hour in a moderately heated oven. 

Prune or Damson Pudding. 

FROM a quart of milk take a few spoonsful, and beat in it 
six yolks of eggs and three whites, four spoonsful of Hour, ;i 
little salt, and two spoonsful of beaten ginger. Then, by de- 
grees, mix in all the milk, and a pound of prunes. Boil it an 
hour tied up in a cloth, and pour melted butter over it. Dam- 
sons done this way eat full as well as prunes. 

A 

Orange Pudding. 

HAVING boiled the rind of a Seville orange very soft, beat it 
in a marble mortar with the juice, and put to it two Naples 
biscuits grated very fine, a quarter of a pound of sugar, half 
a pound 01 butter, and the yolks of six eggs. Mix well toge- 
ther, lay a good puff paste round the edge of the dish, and 
bake it half an hour in a gentle oven. 

Or, take the yolks of sixteen eggs, beat them well with 
half a pint of melted butter, grate in the rind of two Seville 
oranges, beat in half a pound of line sugar, two spoonsful of 
orange flower water, two of rose water, a gill of sack, half a

there on the tops of the puddings, according to fancy. Pour 
melted butter, with a little sack in it, into the dish, and throw 
fine sugar all over the puddings and dish. 

tipple Pudding. 

PARE twelve large pippins, and take out the cores. Put them 
into a saucepan, with four or five spoonsful of water, and boil 
them till soft and thick : beat them well, stir in a pound of 
loaf sugar, the juice of three lemons, and the peel of one cut 
thin and beat fine in a mortar, and the yolks of eight eggs 
beaten. Mix all well together, and bake it in a slack oven. 
When nearly done, throw over it a little fine sugar. It may 
be baked with a puff paste at the bottom of the dish, and 
round the edges of it. 

Apple Dumplins. 

HAVING pared the apples, take out the core with an apple- 
scraper, and fill the hole with quince or orange marmalade, or 
sugar : take a piece of cold paste, and make a hole in it. Lay 
in the apple, and put another piece of paste in the same form, 
and close it up round the side of the apple, which is much 
better thnn gathering it in a lump at one end. Tie it in a 
cloth, and boil it three quarters of an hour. Serve them up 
>vith melted butter poured over them. 

Gooseberry Pudding. 

TAKE half a pint of green gooseberries, and scald them in 
water till soft. Put them into a sieve to drain, and when cold 
work them through a hair sieve with the back of a clean wooden 
spoon. Then add half a pound of sugar, the same of but- 



PUDDINGS. 197 

ter, four ounces of Naples biscuits, and six eggs beaten. Mix 
all together an:! beat them a quarter of an hour. Pour it in 
an carter,:; dish, without paste, and bake it half an hour. 

Suet Dumplins with Currants. 

TAKE a pint of milk, four eggs, a pound of suet, a little 
salt and nutmeg, two tea-spoonsful of ginger, and what flour 
will make it into a light paste. When the water boils, make 
the paste into dumplins, rolled with a little flour, the size of 
a goose's egg. Throw them into the water, and move them 
g nr!\ to prevent their sticking. A little more than half an 
hour will boil them. 

Raspberry Dumplins. 

MAKE a good puff paste, and roll it. Spread over it rasp- 
berrv jam, roll it up, and boil it an hour. Cut it into five slices, 
pour melted butter into the dish, and grated sugar round it. 

Pennyroyal Dumplins. 

GRATE the crumb of a penny loaf, take three quarters of 
a pound of beef suet, the same of currants, four eggs, a little 
brandy, a little thyme and pennyroyal, and a handful of pars- 
ley shred. Mix all well, roll them up with flour, and put them 
into cloths. Three quarters of an hour will boil them. 

Yeast Dumplins. 

WITH flour, water, yeast, and salt, make a light dough as 
for bread, cover it with a cloth, and set it before the fire, for 
half an hour. Then have a saucepan of water on the fire, 
and when it boils take the dough, and make it into little 
round balls, as big as a large hen's egg. Then flatten them, 
with the hand, put them into the boiling water, and a few 
minutes will do them. Take care that they do not fall to the 
bottom of the pot or saucepan, for they will then be heavy, 
and be sure to keep the water boiling all the time. When 
enough take them up, and lay them in the dish, with melted 
butter in a boat. To save trouble, dough may be had at the 
baker's, which will do equally as well. 

Norfolk Dumplins. 

TAKE half a pint of milk, two eggs, a little salt, and make 
them into a good thick batter with flour. Have ready a clean 
saucepan of water boiling, and drop the batter into it, and 
two or three minutes will boil them; but be particularly care- 
ful that the water boils fast when the batter is put in. Theu 



198 PUDDINGS. 

throw them into a sieve to drain, turn them in a dish, and 
stir a lump of fresh butter into them. They will be very good 
if eaten hot. 

Hard Dumplins. 

MAKE some flour and water, with a little salt, into a sort of 
paste. Roll them in balls as big as a turkey's egg. lloll them 
in a little flour, throw them into boiling water, and half an 
hour will boil them. They are best boiled with a good piece 
of beef. Add, for change, a few currants. Serve them up 
with melted butter in a boat. 

Batter Pudding. 

TAKE a quart of milk, beat up the yolks of six eggs, and 
the whites of three, and mix them with a quarter of a pint of 
milk. Take six spoonsful of flour, a tea-spoonful of salt, and 
one of beaten ginger. Mix them all together, boil them an 
hour and a quarter, and pour melted butter over the pudding. 
If approved, put in half a pound of prunes or currants, and 
two or three more eggs. 

Or, take a quart of milk, mix six spoonsful of flour with 
a little of the milk first, a tea-spoonful of salt, two of beaten 
ginger, and two of the tincture of saffron. Then mix all 
together, and boil it an hour. 

Baiter Pudding without Eggs. 

Mix six spoonsful of flour with a little milk, a tea spoonful 
of salt, two tea-spoonsful of beaten ginger, and two of the 
tincture of safFon. Mix it with near a quart of milk, and boil 
it an hour. Fruit may be added. 

A Grateful Pudding. 

To a pound of flour add a pound of white bread grated. 
Take eight eggs, but only half the whites. Beat them up, and 
mix with them a pint of new milk. Then stir in the bread and 
flour, a pound of raisins stoned, a pound of currants, half a 
pound of sugar, and a little beaten ginger. Mix all well to- 
gether, and either bake or boil it. It will 'take three quarters 
of an hour baking. Cream instead of milk, will be a great 
improvement. 

Ratafa Pudding. 

BOIL a quart of cream, with a laurel leaf; take it out, and 
break in half a pound of Naples biscuits, half a pound of but- 



PIES. 199 



ter, some sack, nutmeg, and a little salt. Take it off the fire, 
cover it up, and when almost cold, put in two ounces of 
blanched almonds beaten fine, and the yolks of five eggs. Mix 
all together, and bake it half an hour in a moderately heated 
oven. Before it is put into the'oven grate a little sugar over 
it. 



CHAPTER XVIII. 
PIES. 

PRELIMINARY HINTS AND OBSERVATIONS. 

x\s the heat of your oven must be regulated by what you 
intend to bake, the following rules should be carefully at- 
tended to. Light paste requires a moderate oven, but not 
too slow, as that will deprive it of the light appearance it 
should have; and too quick an oven will catch and burn it, 
without giving it time to rise. Tarts that are iced require a 
slow oven, 'or the icing will be brown before the paste is pro- 
perly baked. Raised pies must have a quick oven, and be 
well closed up, or your pie will fall in the sides. It should 
have no water put in till just before you put it into the oven, 
as that will make the crust look sodden, and perhaps be the 
cause of the pie running, which will infallibly spoil it. 

Different kinds of Pastes for Tarts, Pies, Sfc. 

CRISP paste for tarts is made thus: Mix an ounce of loaf 
sugar, beat and sifted, with a pound of fine flour, and make 
it into a stiff paste with a gill of boiling cream. Work three 
ounces of butter into it, roll it very thin, and having made 
the tarts, beat the white of an egg a little, and rub Jjt over 
them with a feather, and bake them as above directed? " 

* Icing for Tarts. 



BEAT the white of an egg to strong froth, and put in, by 
degrees, four ounces of double-refined sugar, with as much 
gum as will lie on sixpence, beat and sifted fine. Beat them 
naif an hour, and then lay it thin on the tarts. 

PuffPaste. 

RUB a pound of butter very fine into a quarter of a peck of 
flour. Make it up into a light paste with cold water, just stiff 



PIES. 

enough to work.it. Then roll it out about the thickness of a 
<:rown piece, and put a layer of butter ad over. Sprinkle ou 
a htile flour, double it up, and 10'; it out again. Double it 
and roll it out sexen or ei.ght times, when it will be fit for all 
sorts oi pies and tarts that require a puff paste. 

Or, beat the wh te oi an egg to a strong froth, and mix it 
with as much water as will make three quarters of a poiii'd of 
flour into a to.erably stiff paste. Rofl it out vet> thin, lay 
the th.rd part of a half pound of butter in thin piece.-*, and 
.dredge it with a little more flour. Roll it up n^l,, then roll it 
out again, and continue to do so until half a pound ol hotter 
a:.d .flour is used. Cut it in square pieces, and make the tarts. 
This will require a quicker oven than for your crisp paste. 

Paste for Custards. 

POUK half a pound of br iling butter on two pounds of flour, 
with as much water as will make it into a good paste. Work 
it well, and when it has cooled a little, rai^e t e custards, put 
a paper round the inside of them, and when they arc half 
baked, fill them. 

In making any kind of dripping-paste, boil it four or five 
minutes in a good quantity of water, to take the strength oft 7 
it. 

Ccld Crust with Suet. 

SHRED the suet fine, pour part of it into the flour, then 
make it into a paste, and roll it out as before, with this dif- 
ference, make use of suet instead of butter. 

A good Crust for great Pics. 

PUT the volks of three eggs to a peck of flour, and in some 
boiling \\ater, then put half a pound of suet, and a pound 
and a half of butter. Skim off the butter and suet, and as 
much of the liquor as will make it alight gooa crust. Work 
it up well, and roll it out. 

A standing Crust for great Pies. 

TAKE a peck rf flour; and six pounds of butter boiled in a 
gallon of water. Skim it off into the flour, and as little of the 
liquor as possible. Work it up well into a paste, and then 
pull it into pieces till it is cold : make it up into the form re- 
quired. 1 his paste is proper for the walls of a goose pie. 

Lamb or Vtal Pies. 

CUT lamb or veal into little pieces, and season if with pep- 
per, salt, cloves, mace, and nutn eg, beat fine. Make a good 
putt paste crust, lay it into the dish, then lay in the meat, and 
strew on it some stoned rai-.hs and currants clean washed, and 
some sugar : add some forcemeat balls made sweet, and in the 



Plies. 201 

.-summer some artichoke bottoms boiled, and in the winter, 
scalded grapes. Boil Spanish potatoes cut in pieces, candied 
citron, candied orange, lemon peel, and three or four blades 
of mace. Put butter on the top, close up the pie, and bake it. 
Against its return from the oven, have ready a liaison made 
thus: take a pint of white wine, and mix in the yolks of three 
eggs. Stir it well together over the fire, one wav, all the 
time, till it is thick: take it off, stir in sugar enough to sweeten 
it, and squeeze in the juice of a lemon : put it hot into the 
pie, close it up again, and serve as hot as possible. 

Savoury Veal Pie. 

CUT a breast of veal into pieces, season it with pepper and 
salt, and lay it ail into the crust. Boil six or eight hard PI _> s, 
but take only the yolks ; put them into the pie here and mere, 
then fill the dish almost full of second stock, put on the lid, 
and bake it well. 

- Beef Steak Pie. 

BEAT some rump steaks with a rolling-pin, and season them 
with pepper and salt to the palate. Make a good crust, lay in 
the steaks, and then pour in as much \\ater as will half fill the 
dish. Put on the crust, and bake it well. 

Ox Cheek P-ie. 

HAVING baked the ox-cheek, taking care not to do it too 
much, let it lie in the oven all night, and it will be ready for 
further use the next day. Make a fine puff paste crust, and let 
the side and top-crust be thick. The dish must be deep, in 
order to hold a good deal of gravy. Cover the inside of it 
with crust, then cut ail the flesh, kernels, and fat off' the 
head, with the palate cut in pieces. Cut all the meat into 
little pieces, as if it were for a hash, and lay it in the dish. 
Take an ounce of truffles and morels, and throw them over 
the meat, the yolks of six eggs boiled hard, a gill of pickled 
mushrooms, if fresh ones are not to be had ; put in plenty of 
forcemeat balls, a few artichoke bottoms, or asparagus tops, if 
in season. Season the pie with pepper and salt, and fill it 
with the gravy it was baked in. If the head were rightly sea- 
soned before it went to the oven, it will want very little more 
when it comes out. Then put on the lid and bake it, and 
the pie will*be enough as soon as the crust is properly baked. 

. CaJfs Foot Pie. 

HAVING put the calf's feet into a saucepan, with three 
quarts of water, and three or four blades of mace, let them 



202 PIES. 

boil softly till there is about a pint and a half only : take out 
the feet, strain the liquor, and make a good crust. Cover the 
dish, then pick off the flesh from the bones, and lay half in the 
dish : strew over it half a pound of currants, clean washed and 
picked, and half a pound of raisins stoned. Then lay on the 
rest of the meat, skim the liquor, sweeten it to the taste, and 
put in half a pint of white wine. Then pour all into the dish, 
put on the lid, and bake it an hour and a half. 

Mutton Pie. 

TAKE off the skin and inside fat of a loin of mutton, and 
cut it in steaks; season it well with pepper and salt to the 
palate. Lay it into the crust, fill it, and pour in as much 
water as will almost fill the dish : put on the crust, and bake it 
well. 

Venison Pasty. 

HAVING boned a breast or shoulder of venison, season it 
well with pepper, salt, and mace ; lay it in a deep dish, with 
the best part of a neck of mutton, cut in slices, and laid over 
the venison : pour in a large glass of red wine, put a coarse 
paste over it, and bake it two hours in an oven. Then lay the 
venisen into a dish, and pour the gravy and a pound of but- 
ter over it : make a good puff paste, and lay it near half an 
inch thick round the edge of the dish ; roll out the lid, which 
must be somewhat thicker than the paste on the edge of the 
dish, and lay it on : then roll out another lid pretty thin, and 
cut it in flowers, leaves, or whatever form is required, and lay 
it on the lid. If the pie should not be immediately wanted, it 
will keep in the pot it was baked in, eight or ten days ; but 
in that case, keep the crust on, to prevent the air getting into 
it. 

Savoury Veal Pie. 

SEASON a loin of veal, cut into steaks, with salt, pepper, 
nutmeg, and beaten mace ; lay the meat in the dish, with 
sweetbreads seasoned, and the yolks of six hard eggs, a pint of 
oysters, and half a pint of good gravy : lay a good puff paste 
round the dish, half an inch thick, and cover it with a lid of 
the same thickness. Bake it an hour and a quarter in a quick 
oven, and when it is taken out of the oven, cut off the lid ; 
and divide it into eight or ten pieces, sticking them round the 
inside of the rim. Cover the meat with slices of lemon. 

Ham Pie. 

CUT cold boiled ham into slices about half an inch thick, 
and put a good thick crust over the dish : put in a layer of 



PIES. 203 

ham, and shake a little white pepper over it ; take a large 
young fowl, clean picked, gutted, washed, and singed. Put a 
little white pepper and salt in the belly, and rub a very little 
salt on the outside. Lay the fowl on the ham, boil some 
eggs hard, put in the yolks, and cover all with the ham. 
Then shake some white pepper on the ham, and put on the 
top crust. Bake it well, and have ready against it comes out 
of the oven, some very rich beef gravy, enough to fill the pie : 
then lay on the crust again, and send it to table. Some 
truffles and morels boiled, or some fresh mushrooms, or dried 
ones, put into the pie, are a great improvement. 

Calf s- Head Pie. 

HAVING cleansed and boiled the head tender, carefully take 
off the flesh as whole as possible : take out the eyes, and 
slice the tongue ; make a good puff paste crust, cover the 
dish, and lay on the meat. Throw the tongue over it, and 
lay the eyes, cut in two, at each corner. Season it with a very 
little white pepper and salt, pour in half a pint of the liquor 
it was boiled in, lay on it a thick top crust, and bake it an 
hour in a quick oven. In the meantime, boil the bones of 
the head in two quarts of second stock, with two or three blades 
of mace, half a quarter of an ounce of whole pepper, a large 
onion, and a bundle of sweet herbs. Let it boil till it is re- 
duced to about a pint ; strain it off, and add two spoonsful of 
ketchup, three of red wine, a small piece of butter rolled in 
flour, and half an ounce of truffles and morels. Season to 
the palate, and boil it. Boil half the brains with some sage, 
beat them, and twelve leaves of sage chopped fine : stir all 
together, and give it a boil. Take the other part of the brains, 
and beat them, with some of the sage chopped fine, a little 
lemon peel finely minced, and half a small nutmeg grated. 
Beat it up with an egg, and fry it in little cakes of a fine light 
brown. Boil six eggs hard, of which take only the yolks; and 
when the pie comes out of the oven, take off the lid, lay the 
'eggs and cakes over it, and pour in all the sauce Send it hot 
to table without the lid. 

Goose Pie. 

TAKE half a peck of flour, and make the walls of a goose 
pie, as directed in the second article of this chapter respecting 
the different kinds of pastes. Having raised the crust just big 
enough to hold a large goose, take a pickled dried tongue 
boiled tender enough to peel, and cut off the root: bone a 
goose and a large fowl ; take half a quarter of an ounce of mace 
beat fine, a large tea-spoonful of beaten pepper, and three tea- 



204 PIES. 

spoonsful of salt. Mix all together, and season the fowl and 
goose with it. Then lay the fowl in the goose, the* tongue in 
the fowl, and the goose in the same manner as if whole. Put 
half a pound of butter on the top, and put on the lid. This 
pie may be eaten either hot or cold. 

Yorkshire Goose. Pie. 

SPLIT a large fat goose down the back, and take out all the 
bones ; treat a turkey and two ducks the same way, and sea- 
son them well with salt and pepper, and also six woodcocks. 
Lay tht goose down on a clean dish, with the skin-side clown, 
and lay the turkey into the goose in the same manner. Have 
reudy a large hare, well cleaned, and cut in pieces, and stewed 
in the oven, with a pound of butter, a quarter of an ounce of 
mace beat fine, the same of white pepper, ;:nd salt to the taste. 
Stew it till the meat leaves the bones, and skim the butter off 
the gnw. Pick the meat clean off, and beat it very fine in a 
marble mortar witii the butter taken off, arid then lay it in the 
turkey. Take twentv-four pounds of the finest flour, six 
pounds of bu;ter, and half a pound of fresh rendered suet. 
Make the paste pretty thick, andr,aise the pie in an oval form. 
Roil out-a lump of paste, and cut it into vine-leaves, or any 
other form ; then rub the pie with the yolks of eg^s, and put 
the ornaments on the walls : turn the hare, turkev, and goose, 
upside down, and lay them in the pie, with the ducks at each 
end, and the woodcocks at the sides; make the lid pretty 
thick, and put it on. Ornament the lid, but make a hole in 
the middle of it, and make the walls of the pie an inch and a 
half higher than the lid. Then rub it all over with the yolks 
of eggs, and bind it round with three fold paper, and lay the 
same over the top. Bake it four hours; and when it comes 
out, melt two pounds of butter in the gravy that comes from 
the hare, and pour it hot into the pie through a funnel. Close 
it well up, and do not cut it in less than eight or ten days. 
If the pie is to be sent to any distance, it will be necessary, in 
order to prevent the air getting to it, to stop up the hole in the 
middle of the lid with cold butter. 

Yorkshire Gibkt Pie. 

PUT a tea-cup full of grots into the blood of the goose 
while it is warm, in order to swell them. Grate the crumb of 
a penny loaf, and pour on it a gill of boiling milk. Shred half 
a pound of beef suet very fine, chop four or five leaves of sage 
and two leeks very small, put three yolks of eggs, and season 
it to the taste with pepper, salt, and nutmeg. Mix them all 



PIES. 205 

up together, and have ready the giblets well seasoned with 
pepper and salt. Lay them round a deep dish, and put a 
pound of fat beef over the pudding in the middle of the dish. 
Pour in half a pint of gravy, lay on a good paste, and bake it 
in an oven moderately heated. 

Common GiLlet Pie. 

CLF.AN two pair of giblets well, and put all but the livers 
into the saucepan, with two quarts of water, twenty corns of 
wlioie pepper, three blades of mace, a bundle of sweet herbs, 
and a large onion. Cover them close, and let them stew very 
slowly till they are quite tender. Have a good crust ready, 
cover the dish, lay at the bottom a fine rump steak seasoned 
with pepper and salt, put in the giblets with the livers, and 
strain the liquor they were stewed in : season it with salt, and 
pour it into the pie. Put on the lid, and bake it an hour and 
a half. 

Duck Pie. 

TAKE two ducks, scald them, and make them very clean; 
cut off the feet, the pinions, the neck, and head ; take out the 
gizzards, livers, and hearts, and pick all clean, and scald 
them. Pick out the fat of the inside, lay a good puff paste 
crust all over the dish, season the ducks both inside and out 
with pepper and salt$ and lay them in the dish, with the gib- 
lets at each end properly seasoned. Put in as much water as 
will nearly fill the pie, and lay on the crust. 

Pigeon Pie. 

LET the pigeons be very nicely picked and cleaned, and 
season them with pepper and salt. Put a large piece of fresh 
butter, with pepper and salt, into their bellies. Then cover 
the dish with a puff paste crust, and lay in the pigeons, and 
put between them the necks, gizzards, livers, pinions, and 
hearts, with the yolk of a hard egg, and a beef steak in the 
middle. Put as much water as will nearly fill the dish, and 
lay on the top crust, and bake it well. 

Savoury Chicken Pie. 

TAKE small chickens and season them with pepper, salt, and 
mace. Put a piece of butter into each of them, and lay them 
in the dish with the breasts upwards. Lay a thin slice of 
bacon over them, which will give them an agreeable flavour. 
Then put in a pint of strong gravy, and make a good puff 
paste. Put on the lid, and bake it in a moderately heated 
oven 



206- 



Hare Pie, 



CUT it into pieces, and season it with nutmeg, pepper, and 
salt. Ju- it with half a pound of butter. It must do above 
an hour, close covered in a pot of boiling water. Make force- 
meat, to whiqh add the liver bruised, and a glass of red wine. 
Let it be high seasoned, lay it round the inside of a raised 
crust, put in the hare when cool; and add the gravy that 
comes from it, with some more rich gravy. Put on the lid, 
and bake it two hours. 

Rabbit Pie to be eaten hot. 

TAKE a couple of young rabbits, and cut them into quar- 
ters; take a quarter of a pound of bacon, and bruise it to 
pieces in a marble mortar, with the livers, some pepper, salt, 
a little mace, and some parsley cut small, some chives, and a 
few leaves of sweet basil. When these are all beaten fine, 
make the paste, and cover the bottom of the pie with the sea- 
soning. Then put in the rabbits, pound some more bacon in 
a mortar, and with it some fresh butter; cover the rabbits 
with it, and over that la}^ some thin slices of bacon. Put on 
the lid, and send it to the oven. It will take t\ro hours bak- 
ing. When it is done, take off the lid, take out the bacon, 
and skim off the fat. If there is not gravy enough in the pie, 
pour in some rich veal gravy boiling hot. 

Partridge Pie to be eaten hot. 

TAKE three brace of full-grown partridges, and let them be 
trussed in the same manner as a fowl for boiling. Put into a 
marble mortar shalots, some parsley cut small, the livers of 
the partridges, and twice the quantity of bacon : beat these 
together, and season them with pepper, salt, and a blade or 
two of mace. When these are all pounded to a paste, add 
to them some fresh mushrooms. Then raise the crust for the 
pie, and cover the bottom of it with the seasoning; then lay 
in the partridges, but no stuffing in them ; put the remainder 
of the seasoning about the sides and between the partridges ; 
then strew over them some pepper and salt, and a little mace, 
some fresh mushrooms, and a little bacon, beat fine in a mor- 
tar. Lay a layer of it over the partridges, and some thin slices 
of bacon. Put on the lid. It will take two hours and a half 
baking, When it is done, take off the lid and the slices of 
bacon, arid skim off the fat. Put in a pint of rich veal gravy, 
and squeeze in the juice of an orange. 




t>IES. 207 



Partridge Pie to be eaten cold. 

TRUSS and beat the breasts of six or eight young partridges 
very flat ; singe and broil them upon a stove over a very clear 
charcoal fire. When they are cold, lard them ; beat some 
bacon in a mortar, and mix it with the livers scalded and 
bruised. Put some of this into the partridges. Then make a 
seasoning with some sweet herbs, pepper, salt, nutmeg, mace, 
and some lemon peel shred very fine. Make a raised crust 
for the pie, and lay upon it a little of the stuffing of the livers 
of the partridges ; over that a little of the seasoning, and then 
lay in the partridges ; strew some of the seasoning over them ; 
then put among them some bits of butter, and a little bacon 
cut very fine, with a few leaves of sweet basil, two or three 
bay-leaves, a few fresh truffles. Lay these amongst the par- 
tridges, and over them a few thin slices of bacon. Put on the 
lid, and send it to the oven. It will take three hours baking ; 
after which it must stand to be cold. 

A Woodcock Pie to be eaten cold. 

THE woodcock and partridge pie are made nearly alike, only 
the entrails are made use of. When the woodcocks are picked, 
put the entrails by, and truss them as for roasting. Make the 
breast-bone flat, and broil them over some clear charcoal. 
When they are cold, lard them all over; then pound some 
bacon in a marble mortar, mix it with the livers of the wood- 
cocks, which also bruise, with two or three leaves of sweet 
basil. Cut the entrails very small, and mix them with the 
other seasoning. Raise the pie, lay at the bottom some of the 
stuffing, and put the rest into the birds, putting between them 
some pounded bacon and fresh butter mixed together, with a 
very little mace, pepper, and salt. When the pie is almost 
filled, take a cutlet, cut quite round a fillet of veal, and over 
that some slices of bacon cut very thin. Then put on the lid. 
It should stand three or four hours, according to the quan- 
tity of birds, and when it comes out of the oven, set it to 
cool. 

Savoury Patties. 

TAKE a quarter of a pound of beef suet, and a pound of 
the inside of a cold loin of veal, or the same quantity of cold 
fowl that has been either boiled or roasted, and chop them as 
small as possible with six or eight sprigs of parsley. Season 
them with pepper and salt, and half a nutmeg finely grated. 
Put them into a stewpan, with half a. pint of veal stock : 
thicken the gravy with a little flour and butter, and two 



208 

spoonsful of cream : shake them over the fire two or three 
minutes, and fill the patties. The pattie* must be made in 
this manner : Raise them of an oval form, and Lake them as 
for custards. Cut some Ioi5g, narrow bits of paste, an-! bake 
them on a dusting-box, bi:t not to go round, they being for 
handles. Fill the patties when quite hot wi'h the meat, and 
set on the handles across the patties, when they will look like 
baskets. 

Cheshire Pork Pie. 

SKIN a loin of pork, and cut it into steaks. Season it with 
pepper, salt, and nutmeg, and make a good crust. Put into 
the dish a layer of pork, then a layer of pippins pared and 
cored, and sugar sufficient to sweeten it. Then place another 
layer of pork, and put in half a pint of white wine. Then 
lay some butter on the top, and close the pie. 

French Pie. 

PUT three quarters of a pound of butter to two pounds of 
flour, and make it into a paste, and raise the walls of the pie. 
Then roll out some paste thin as for a lid, and cut it into vine- 
leaves, or the figures of any moulds required. Beat the 
yolks of two eggs, and rub the outside of the walls of the pie 
with it, and lay the vine-leaves or other figures round the 
walls, and rub them over with the eggs. Fill the pie with the 
bones of the meat, to keep the steam in, that the crust may 
be well soaked ; for it must have no lid on when it goes to 
table. Then take a calf's head, wash and clean it well, and 
boil it half an hour. When cold, cut it in thin slices, and put 
it in a stewpan, with three pints of veal stock, and three sweet- 
breads cut thin. Let it stew an hour, with half an ounce of 
morels and the same quantity of truffles. Have ready two 
calf's feet boiled and boned ; cut them into small pieces, 
and put them into the stewpan, with a spoonful of lemon 
pickle, one of browning, some cayenne, and a, little salt. 
When the meat is tender, thicken the gravy a little with but- 
ter and Hour: strain it, and put in a few pickled mushrooms, 
but fresh ones are preferable, if they are to be had. Put the 
meutJnto the pie out of which the bones were taken, and lay 
the nicest part at the top. Have ready a quarter of a hundred 
of asparagus heads, and strew them over the top of the pie, 
having first poured in all the gravy. 

Devonshire Squab Pie. 

COVFR the dish with a good crust, and put at the bottom 
of it a layer of sliced pippins, and then a layer of mutton 



P1RS. 09 

steaks cut from the loin, well seasoned with pepper and salt. 
Then put another layer of pippins, peel some onions, and 
slice them thin, and put a layer of them over the apples. 
Then put a layer of mutton, and then pippins and onions. 
Pour in a pint of water, close up the pie, and hake it. 

Apple Pie. 

HAVING put a good puff paste, crust round the edge of the 
dish, pare and quarter the apples, and take out the cores : 
lay a thick row of apples, and throw in half the sugar intended 
to be put into the pie. Mince a little lemon peel fine, spread 
it over the sugar and apples, and squeeze a little lemon over 
them : scatter a few cloves over it, and lav on the rest of the 
apples and sugar. Sweeten to the palate, and squeeze a little 
more lemon. Boil the peeling of the apples and cores in 
some water, with a blade of mace, till it. has a pleasing taste ; 
strain it, and boil the syrup with a little sugar, till there is 
but a small quantity left. Pour it into the pie, put on the 
upper crust, and bake it. A little quince or marmalade may 
be added. In the same manner a pear pie may be made, but 
omit the quince. A liaison may be added to the pie when 
cold. 

Apple Tart. 

HAVING scalded eight or ten large codlins, let them stand 
till they are cold, and then skin them. Take the pulp, and 
beat it as fine as possible with a spoon : mix the yolks of six 
eggs, and the whites of four. Beat altogether very fine, put 
in grated nutmeg, and sweeten it to the taste. "Melt some 
good fresh butter, and beat it till of the consistence of fine 
thick cream ; make a puff paste, and cover a tin pattypan 
with it ; pour in the ingredients, but do not cover it with the 
paste. Having baked it a quarter of an hour, slip it out of the 
pattypan on a dish, and strew over it some sugar finely 
beaten and sifted. 

Codlin Pie. 

PUT some small codlins into a clean pan with spring water, 
lay vine-leaves on them, and cover them with a cloth wrap- 
ped round the cover of the pan to keep in the steam. As 
soon as they grow soft, peel them, and put them in the same 
water with the vine-leaves. Hang them a great height over 
the fire to green, and when of a fine colour, take them out of 
the water, and put them into a deep dish, with as much pow- 
der and loaf sugar as will sweeten them. Make the lid of 
rich puff paste, and bake it. When it comes from the oven, 

p 



210 PIES. 

take off the lid, and cut it in little pieces like sippets, and 
stick them round the inside of the pie with the points up- 
wards. Then add a liaison. 

Potatoc Pie. 

TAKE three pounds of potatoes, boil and peel them. Make 
a good crust, and Jay it in your dish. Put half a pound of 
butter at the bottom of it, and then lay in the potatoes. 
Throw over them three tea-spoonsful of salt, and a small nut- 
meg grated all over ; boil six eggs hard, chop them fine, and 
scatter them over it, as also a tea-spoonful of pepper, and 
add half a pint of white wine. Cover the pie, and bake it 
half an hour, or till the crust is enough. 

Artichoke Pie. 

HAVING boiled twelve artichokes, take off the leaves and 
chokes, and take the bottoms clear from the stalks. Make a 
good puff paste crust, and lay a quarter of a pound of good 
fresh butter all over the bottom of the pie. Then lay a row 
of artichokes, strew a little pepper, salt, and beaten mace 
over them, then another row, and strew the rest of the spice 
over them. Put in a quarter of a pound more of butter in 
little bits, take half an ounce of truffles and morels, and boil 
them in a quarter of a pint of water. Pour the water into 
the pie, cut the truffles and morels very small, and throw them 
all over the pie : have ready twelve eggs boiled hard, of which 
take only the hard yolks, and lay them over the pie. Pour 
in a gill of white wine, cover the pie, and bake it. When the 
crust is done, the pie will be enough. Four large blades of 
mace, and twelve pepper-corns, with a tea-spoonful of salt, 
will be sufficient. 

Onion Pie. 

PEEL some onions, and wash and pare some potatoes, and 
cut them into slices ; also pare some apples, and slice them. 
Make a good crust, cover the dish, and lay a quarter of a 
pound of butter all over. Take a quarter of an ounce of 
mace beaten fine, a nutmeg grated, a tea-spoonful of beaten 
pepper, and three tea-spoonsful of salt. Mix altogether, and 
strew some over the butter. Lay a layer of potatoes, a layer 
of onions, a layer of apples, then a layer of eggs, and so on 
till the pie is filled, strewing a little of the seasoning between 
each layer, and i quarter of a pound of butter in bits, with 
six spoonsful of water. Close the pie, and bake it an hour 
and a half. A pound of potatoes, a pound of onions, a pound 
of apples, and twelve eggs, will be sufficient. 



PIES 211 

Cherry Pie. 

HAVING made a good crust, lay a little of it round the sides 
of the dish, and throw sugar at the bottom. Then lay in the 
fruit, and some sugar at the top. A few red currants put 
along with the cherries make an agreeable addition. Then 
put on the lid, and bake it in a slack oven. A plumb pit, or 
gooseberry pie may be made in the same manner. If it is de- 
sired that the fruit look red, let the pie stand a good while in 
the oven after the bread is drawn. A custard eats very well 
with a gooseberry pie. 

Mince Pie. 

TAKE a neat's tongue, and boil it two hours; then skin it, 
and chop it as small as possible. Chop very small three 
pounds of beef suet, the same quantity of good baking apples, 
four pounds of currants clean washed, picked, and well dried 
before the fire, a pound of jar raisins stoned and chopped 
small, and a pound of powder sugar. Mix them all together 
with half an ounce of mace, the same quantity of grated nut- 
meg, a quarter of an ounce of cloves, the same quantity of 
cinnamon, and a pint of French brandy. Make a rich puff 
paste, and as the pattypans are filled, put in a little candied 
citron and orange cut in little pieces. Put close down in a 
pot what mincemeat is left, and cover it up ; but never put 
any citron or orange to it till wanted for use. 

Or, shred three pounds of suet very fine, and chopped as 
small as possible. Take two pounds of raisins stoned, and 
chopped as fine as possible ; two pounds of currants nicely 
picked, washed, rubbed, and dried at the fire ; half a hundred 
of fine pippins pared, cored, and chopped small ; half a 
pound of fine sugar pounded fine ; a quarter of an ounce of 
mace, the same quantity of cloves, and two large nutmegs, all 
beat fine. ?Put all together into a great pan, and mix them well 
together with half a pint of brandy, and the same quantity of 
sack. Put it close down into a stone pan, and it will keep 
good for months. If meat is approved of in the pies, take two 
rounds of the inside of a sirloin of beef boiled, chopped as 
fine as possible, and mixed with the rest; or a neat's tongue 
parboiled, and treated as above directed. 



Lent Mince Pie. 

BOIL six eggs hard, and chop them fine ; take twelve pip- 
pins pared and chopped small ; a pound of raisins of the

it in a slack oven. Squeeze in the juice of a Seville orange. 

I'orkshire Chris/mas Pie. 

HAVING made a good standing crust, with the wall and 
bottom very thick, take and bone a turkey, a goose, a fowl, 
a partridge, and a pigeon. Season them well, and take half 
an ounce of mace, the same quantity of nutmegs, a quarter 
of an ounce of cloves, and half an ounce of black pepper, all 
beat fine together. Then add two large spoonsful of salt : 
mix all well together. Open the fowls all down the back, and 
bone, first the pigeon, then the partridge, and cover them. 
Then proceed in the same manner with the fowl, goose, and 
turkey, which must be large. Season them all well, and then 
lay them in the crust, so that it may look only like a whole 
turkey. Then have a hare ready cased, and wiped with a 
clean cloth. Disjoint the hare into pieces, season it, and lav- 
it as clo e as possible on one side ; and on the other side put 
woodcocks, moor-game, and any sort of wild fowl. Season 
them well, and lay them close. Put at least four pounds of 
butter into the pie, and then lay on the lid, which must be 
very thick, and let it be well baked. It must have a very hot 
oven, and will take four hours baking at least. This crust will 
take a bushel of flour. 

Shropshire Pie. 

Cur two rabbits into pieces, with two pounds of fat pork 
cut small, and season both with pepper and salt to the taste. 
ThLMi m;;ke a good puff paste crust, cover the dish with it,

t':e livers of the rabbits, parboil them and beat them in a mor- 
tar, with the same quantity of fat bacon, a little sweet herbs, 
and some ovsters. Season them with pepper, salt, and nut- 
meg, mix it up with the yolk of an egg, and make it up into 
littl^ balls. Scatter them about the pie, with some articnoke 
bottoms cut in dices, and some cock's-combs. Grate a small

pound it very line, and season it with salt and \vii;tr pepper. 
Make a fine pun 1 ' paste, roll it nut in thin square sheet*, and 
put the forcemeat in the middle. Cover tne pie, clo-^o it all 
round, and cut the pasj;e even. Befo.e they are put into the 
oven, wash them over with the yolk of an e^g, and bake 
them twenty minutes in a quick oven. Have ready a little 
white gravy, seasoned with pepper, salt, and a little eschalot, 
thickened tip with a little cream or hutter. When the patties 
come out of the oven, make a hole in the top, and pour in 
some gravy; hut take care not to put in too much, lest it 
should run out at the sides, which will spoil thu appearance 
of them. 

Olive Pie. 

TAKE the thin coMops of the hest end of a leg of veal, in 
quantity proportionate to the .size of the intended pie. Hack 
them with the back of a knife, and season them with pepper, 
salt, cloves, and mace. Wash over the collops with a bunch 
of feathers dipped in eggs, and have in readiness a bunch of 
sweet herbs shred small, such as thyme, parsley, and spinach. 
Take the yolks of eight hard eggs minced, and a few oysters 
parboiled and chopped, and some beef suet shred very fine. 
Mix these together, and strew them over the collops. Then 
sprinkle a little orange-flower water over them, and roll the 
collops up very close. Then put the crust on the dish, lay 
the collops in it, put butter on the top, and ciose the pie. 
When it comes out of the oven, have ready some hot gravy, 
with an anchovy dissolved in it, and pour it into the pie.

beaten cinnamon and nutmeg ; take a pound of currants 
clean washed and picked, two or three spoonsful of cream, 
and a little sack and rose-water. Mix all together, and fill 
the pie with it. When it is baked, stir in half a pound of 
fresh butter, and the juice of a lemon. 

Sweet Egg Pie. 

COVER the dish with a good crust, and then take twelve 
eggs boiled hard, cut them into slices, and lay them in the 
pie. Throw half a pound of currants, clean washed and 
picked, all over the eggs. Then beat up four eggs well, 
mixed with half a pint of white wine, grate in a small nut- 



PIES. 



meg, and make it pretty sweet with sugar. Remember to 
lay a quarter of a pound of butter between the eggs, then 
pour in the wine and eggs, and cover the pie. Bake it till the 
crust js done, which will be in about half an hour. 

Orange or Lemon Tarts. 

RUB six large lemons well with salt, and put them into wa- 
ter, with a handful of salt in it, for two days. Then change 
them every day into fresh water, without salt, for a fortnight: 
boil them for two or three hours till they are tender ; cut them 
into half quarters, and then cut them three-corner ways as 
thin as possible. Take six pippins pared, cored, and quar- 
tered, and a pint of water. Let them boil till the pippins 
break, put the liquor to the orange or lemon, half the pulp of 
the pippins well broken, and a pound of sugar. Boil these 
together a quarter of an hour, then put it into a bason, and 
squeeze into it an orange. If a lemon tart, squeeze a lemon. 
Two spoonsful are enough for a tart. Put very fine puff 
paste, and very thin, into the pattypans, which must be small 
and shallow. Just before the tarts are put into the oven, 
with a feather or brush rub them over with melted butter, 
and then sift double-refined sugar over them, which will form 
a pretty icing. 

Tart de Moi. 

LAY round the dish a puff paste, and then a layer of bis- 
cuit ; then a layer of butter and marrow, another of all sorts 
of sweetmeats, and thus proceed till the dish is full : boil a 
quart of cream, and thicken it with four eggs, and put in a 
spoonful of orange-flower water. Sweeten it with sugar to 
the palate, and pour it over the whole. Half an hour will 
bake it. 

Skirret Pie. 

BOIL the skirrets tender, peel and slice them, and fill the 
pie with them. To half a pint of cream take the yolk of an 
egg, and beat it fine. Put to it a little grated nutmeg, a 
little beaten mace, and a little salt. Beat all well together, 
with a quarter of a pound of fresh butter melted, and pour 
in as much as the dish will hold. Put on the top-crust, and 
bake it half an hour. If cream cannot be put, add milk. 

Turbot Pie. 

WASH and parboil the turbot, and season it with a little 
pepper, salt, cloves, mace, nutmeg, and sweet herbs cut fine. 
N\ hen the paste is made, lay in the turbot, with some yolks,

on the top, and close it up. It is good cold or hot. 

Tench Pie. 

LAY a layer of butter at the bottom of the dish, then grate 
in some nutmeg, with pepper, salt, and mace. Lay in the 
tench, cover them with some butter, and pour in some red 
wine and a little water. Then put on the lid, and when it 
comes from the oven, pour in melted butter, with some gravy 
in it. 

Trout Pie. 

LARD a brace of trout with eels ; raise the crust, and lay a 
layer of fresh butter at the bottom. Then make a forced 
meat of trout, mushrooms, truffles, morels, chives, and fresh 
butter. Season them with salt, pepper, and spice; mix these 
up with the yolks of two eggs; stuff the trout with this forced 
meat, lay them in the pie, cover them with butter, put on the 
lid, and send it to the oven. Have some good fish gravy ready 
to pour into the pie when it is baked. 

Eel Pie. 

HAVING skinned and washed the eels very clean, cut them 
in pieces an inch and a half long : season with pepper, salt, 
and a little dried sage rubbed small, and raise the pies about 
the size of the inside of a plate. Fill them with eels, and 
lay a lid over them. Bake them well in a quick oven. 

Carp Pie. 

SCALE, gut, and wash, a large carp clean. Take an eel, 
and boil it till almost tender, pick off all the meat, and mince 
it fine, with an equal quantity of crumbs of bread, a few sweet 
herbs, a lemon-peel cut fine, and a little pepper, salt, and grated 
nutmeg ; an anchovy, half a pint of oysters parboiled and 
chopped fine, and the yolks of three hard eggs cut small. 
Roll it up with a quarter of a pound of butter, and fill the 
belly of the carp. Make a good crust, cover the dish, and 
lay in the carp. Save the liquor the eels were boiled in, 
put into it the eel bones, and boil them with a little mace, 
whole pepper, an onion, some sweet herbs, and an anchovy. 
Boil till reduced to about half a pint, strain it, and add to it

ter about the size of a hen's egg mixed in a very little flour. 
Boil it up, and pour it into the pie. Put on the lid, and bake 



216 PIES. 

it an hour m a quick oven. If there be any forcemeat left 
after filling the belly of the carp make balls of it, and put it 
into the pie. If there is not liquor enough, boil a few small 
eels for that purpose. 

Salt Fish Pie. 

LAY a side of salt fish in water all night, and next morning 
put it over the fire in a pan of water till tender. Drain it, and 
lay it on the dresser; take off all the skin, and pick the meat 
clean from the bones, and mince it small. Take the crumb 
of two French rolls cut in slices, and boil it up with a quart of 
new milk. Break the bread very fine with a" spoon, put it 
to the minced salt fish, with a pound of melted butter, two 
spoonsful of minced parsley, half a nutmeg grated, a little 
beaten pepper, and three tea-spoonsful of mustard. Mix all

till they are tender, and pick all the flesh clean from the bones. 
Throw the bones into the liquor the eels were boiled in, with a 
little mace and salt, till it is very good, and reduced to a quar- 
ter of a pint, and then strain it. In the meantime, cut the 
flesh of the eel fine, with a little lemon-peel shred fine, a 
little salt, pepper, and nutmeg, a few crumbs of bread, chop- 
ped parsley, and an anchovy. Melt a quarter of a pound of 
butter and mix with it, and then lay it in a dish. Cut the 
flesh off a pair of large soles, or three pair of very small 
ones, clean from the bones and fins. Lay it on the force- 
meat, and pour in the liquor of the eels. Put on the lid of 
the pie and bake it. Boil the bones of the soles with the eel 
bones, to make it good ; but if the sole bones are boiled with 
one or two little eels, without the forcemeat, the pie will be 
very good. A turbot may be dressed in the same manner. 

Flounder Pie. 

HAVING gutted the flounders, wash them clean, and dry 
them in a cloth. Just boil them, cut off the meat clean from 
the bones, lay a good crust over the dish, and lay a little fresh 
butter at the bottom, and on that the fish. Season with pep- 
per and salt to your mind. Boil the bones in the water the 
fish was boiled in, with a little bit of horse-radish, a little 
parsley, a very little bit of lemon-peel, and a crust of bread. 
Boil it till there is jnst enough liquor for the pie, then strain 
it, and put it into the pie. Put on the top crust, and bake it. 



PIES. 217 



Herring Pie. 

HAVING scaled, gutted, and v;ashed the herrings clean, cut 
off their heads, fins, and tails. Make a good crust, cover the 
dish, and season the herrings with beaten rnace, pepper, and 
salt. Put a little butter in the bottom of the dish, and then 
a row of herrings. Pare some apples, and cut them into thin 
slices over the dish. Then peel some onions, and cut them 
in the same manner. Lay a little butter on the top, put in a 
little water, lay on the lid, and bake it well. 

Salmon Pie. 

HAVING made a good crust, cleanse a piece of salmon well, 
season it with salt, mace, and nutmeg, lay a piece of butter 
at the bottom of the dish, and lay the salmon in. Melt but- 
ter according to the pie. Take a lobster, boil it, pick out all 
the flesh, chop it small, bruise the body, and mix it well with 
the butter, which must be very good. Pour it over the sal- 
mon, put on the lid, and bake it well. 

Lobster Pic. 

BOIL two or three lobsters, take the meat out of their tails 
whole, and cut them in four pieces longways. Take out all 
the spawn, and the meat of the claws ; beat it well in a mor- 
tar, and season it with pepper, salt, iwo spoonsful of vine- 
gar, and a little anchovy liquor. Melt half a pound of fresh 
butter, and stir all together, with the crumbs of a halfpenny 
roll rubbed through a fine cullender, and the yolks of two 
eggs. Put a fine puff paste over the dish, lay in the tails, 
and the rest of the meat over them. Put on the cover, and 
bake it in a slow oven. 

Muscle Pie. 

HAVING laid a good crust all over the dish, wash the muscles 
clean in several waters; then pu f them into a deep stewpan, 
cover them, and let them stew till they open : pick them out, 
and see there are no crabs under the tongue. Put them into 
a saucepan, with two or three blades of mace (strain liquor 
just enough to cover them), a good piece of butter, and a 
few crumbs of bread. Stew them a few minutes, fill the pie, 
put on the lid, and bake it half an hour. Always let the fish 
be cold before the lid is put on, or it will spoil the crust. 
Oyster pie may be made in the same manner. 



218 PANCAKES AND FRITTERS. 



CHAPTER XIX. 



PANCAKES AND FRITTERS. 

Cream Pancakes. 

JMix the yolks of two eggs with half a pint of cream, two 
ounces of sugar, and a little beaten cinnamon, mace, and 
nutmeg; rub the pan with lard, and fry them as thin as pos- 
sible : grate sugar over them. 

Milk Pancakes. 

PUT six or eight eggs, leaving out half the whites, into a 
quart of milk, and mix them well till the batter is of a fine 
thickness : observe to mix the flour first with a little milk, 
then add the rest by degrees. Put in two spoonsful of beaten 
ginger, a glass of brandy, and a little salt. Stir all together, 
and make the frying-pan very clean. Put in a piece of but- 
ter of the size of a walnut, and then put in a ladleful of bat- 
ter, which will make a pancake, moving the pan round, so 
that the batter may be every where even alike in the pan ; 
when that side is enough, toss it or turn it cleverly without 
breaking it. When done, lay it in a dish before the fire, 
and proceed to do the rest in like manner. Strew a little 
sugar over them, and take care that they are dry. 

Rice Pancakes. 

TAKE three spoonsful of flour of rice, and a quart of 
cream ; set it on a slow fire, and keep stirring it till as thick 
as pap: pour into it half a pound of butter and a nutmeg 
grated : pour it into an earthern pan, and when cold, stir in 
three or four spoonsful of flour, a little salt, some sugar, and 
nine eggs well beaten ; mix all well together, and fry them 
nicely. When cream is not to be had, use new milk, and a 
spoonful more of the Hour of rice. 

Custard Fritters. 

Beat the yolks of eight eggs with one spoonful of flour, 
half a nutmeg, a little salt, and brandy, add a pint of cream ; 
sweeten it, and bake in a small dish. When cold, cut it into 
quarters ; dip them in batter made of half a pint of cream, a 
quarter of a pint of milk, four eggs, a little flour, and a little 



PANCAKES AND FRITTEUS. 219 

ginger grated. Fry them a little brown, in good lard or drip- 
ping. Grate sugar over them, and serve them up hot 

Common Fritters. 

GET the largest baking-apples, pare them, and take out the 
core with an apple-scraper; cut them in round slices, and dip 
them in batter made thus : take half a pint of ale and two 
eggs-, and beat in as much flour as will make it rather thicker 
than a common pudding, with nutmeg and sugar to the taste. 
Let it stand three or four minutes to rise. Having dipped the 
apples into this batter, fry them crisp, and serve them up 
with sugar grated over them, and wine sauce in a boat. 

Fine Fritters. 

TAKE some of the finest flour, and dry it well before the 
fire : mix it with a quart of new milk, but take care not to 
make it too thick. Put to it six or eight eggs, a little 
nutmeg, mace, and salt, and a quarter of a pint of sack or 
ale, or a glass of brandy. Beat them well together, then 
make them pretty thick with pippins, boiled and pulped 
through a sieve, and fry them dry. 

White Fritters. 

WASH at least an ounce of rice in five or six different wa- 
ters, and dry it well before the fire. Then beat it very fine 
in a mortar, and sift it through a lawn sieve: put it into a 
saucepan, just wet it with milk, and when well incorporated 
with it, add to it another pint of milk. Set the whole over 
a stove, or a very slow fire, and take care to keep it always 
moving : add a little ginger, and some candied lemon-peel 
grated. Keep it over the fire till it almost come to the thick- 
ness of a fine paste, flour a peal, pour it on it, and spread it 
out with a rolling-pin. When cold, cut it into little morsels, 
taking care that they do not stick one to the other. Roll up the 
fritters handsomely, and fry them. Serve them up with sugar 
over them, and pour over them a little orange-flower water. 

A Quire of Paper. 

TAKE three spoonsful of fine flour, a pint of cream, sijf 
eggs, three spoonsful of sack, one of orange-flower water, a 
little sugar, half a nutmeg grated, and half a pound of melted 
butter almost cold. Mix all well together, and butter the pan 
for the first pancake. Let them run as thin as possible, and 
when they are just coloured, they will be enough. In this 
manner all the fine pancakes should be fried. 



220 PANCAKES AND FRITTERS. 



Almond Froze. 

STEEP a pound of Jordan almonds blanched, in a pint of 
cream, ten yolks of eggs, and four whites : take out the al- 
monds, and pound them fine in a mortar ; mix them again in 
the cream and eggs, and put in some sugar and grated white 
bread : stir them all together, put some fresh butter into the 
pan, and as soon as it is hot, pour in the batter, stirring it in 
the pan till of a good thickness. When enough, turn it into 
a dish, and throw sugar over it. 

Fritters Royal. 

PUT a quart of new milk into a saucepan, and when it be- 
gins to boil, pour in a pint of sack : take it off, ]et it stand 
five or six minutes, skim off the curd, and put it into a bason. 
Beat it up well with six eggs, and season it with nutmeg. 
Then beat it with a whisk, and flour sufficient to give it the 
usual thickness of batter, put in some sugar, and fry them 
quick. 

Currant Fritters without Eggs. 

TAKE half a pint of ale that is not bitter, and stir into it 
flour to make it pretty thick, with a few currants. Beat this 
up quick : have the lard boiling ; throw in a large spoonful at 
a time. 

Raspberry Fritters. 

GRATE the crumb of a French roll, or two Naples biscuits; 
put to either a pint of boiling cream : when this is cold, add 
to it the yolks of four eggs well beaten. Beat all well together 
with some raspberry juice; drop them into a pan of boiling 
lard, in very small quantities. Stick them with blanched al- 
monds sliced. 

Tansy Fritters. 

Pouu a pint of boiling milk on the crumb of a penny loaf 
grated. When cold, add a spoonful of brandy, sugar to the 
taste, the rind of half a lemon, the yolks of four eggs, and 
spinach and tansy juice to colour it. Mix this over the fire, 
with a quarter of a pound of butter, till thick. Let it stand 
near three hours, and drop it, a spoonful to a fritter, ii to 
boiling lard. 

Rice Fritters. 

BOIL a quarter of a pound of rice in milk till it is pretty 
thick ; then mix it with a pint of cream, four eggs, some 



PANCAKES AND FRITTERS. 221 

sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg ; six ounces of currants washed 
and picked, a little salt, and as much flour as will make it a 
thick batter. Fry them in little cakes in boil.ng lard. Serve 
them with white sugar and butter. 

Carrot Fritters, 

TAKK two or three boiled carrots, beat them wit'i a spoon, 
and pulp them through a sieve. Put to every carrot svo or 
three eggs ; a little nutmeg; to three carrots pur a h..miful of 
flour ; wet them with cream, milk, or sack, and ad. I to Mem 
as much sugar as will sweeten them. Beat them well half an 
hour, and fry them in boiling lard. Squeeze over them a 
Seville orange, and shake some fine sugar over them. 

German Fritters. 

TAKE some well-tasted crisp apples, pare, quarter, and 
core them ; take the core quite out, and cut them into ror,'id 
pieces: put into a stewpan a quarter of a pint of Fre-ch 
brandy, a table spoonful of fine sugar pounded, an.; I ^le 
cinnamon. Put the apples into this liquor, and set tuem over 
a very gentle fire, stirring them often, but not to break t ijem. 
Set on a stewpan with some lard. When it boils dnu.i the 
apples, dip them in some fine flour, and put them into the 
pan; they will be brown and very good. Strew som s;!gar 
over a dish, and set it on the fire; lay in the fritters, strew a 
little sugar over them, and glaze them over with a red-hot 
salamander. 

Bilboquet Fritters. 

BREAK five eggs into two handsful of fine flour, and put 
milk enough to make it work well together; then put in some 
salt, and work it again. When it is well maJe, put a tea- 
spoonful of powder of cinnamon, the same quantity of lemon- 
peel grated, and half an ounce of candied citron cut very 
small with a penknife. Put on a stewpan, nib it over with 
butter, and put in the paste. Set it over a very gentle fi'e on 
a stove, and let it be done very gently, without sticking to the 
bottom or sides of the pan. When it is in a manner baked, 
take it out and lay it on a dish. Set on a stewpan witii a 
large quantity of lard ; when it boils cut the paste t^e size of 
a finger, and then cut it across at each end, which wid rise 
and be hollow, and have a very good eil'ect. Put them into 
the boiling lard, but great care must be taken in frying them, 
as they rise so much. When they are done, sift some sugar 
on a warm dish, lay on the fritters, and sift some more sugar 
over them. 



222 PANCAKES AND FRITTERS. 



Point du Jour Fritters. 

TAKE a glass of mountain, and a large spoonful of brandy. 
Mix two handsful of flour with some warm milk, and the 
brandy and wine, and work it into a paste. Beat up the white 
of four eggs to a froth, and mix them with the batter. Then 
add to them half an ounce of candied citron-peel, half an 
ounce of fresh lemon-peel grated, some salt and sugar. Let 
it be all well beat up together ; then set on a small deep stew- 
pan, with a good quantity of hog's lard, and when it is boil- 
ing hot, drop in some of the batter through a tin funnel made 
on purpose, with a large body and three pipes. Hold the 
funnel over the boiling lard, and pour the batter through it 
with a ladle. It must be kept moving over the pan till all is 
run out, and this, from the three streams, shapes the fritters. 
When the batter is all out, turn the fritters, for they are soon 
brown. Then put one at a time upon a rolling pin, and they 
will be the shape of a rounded leaf, which is the proper shape 
of these fritters. Great nicety is required in making them ; 
but they are an elegant dish. When the first is made, it 
should be a pattern for the rest. If too thick, pour in the less 
batter for the next ; and if too thin, a little more. 

Chicken Fritters. 

PUT on a stewpan with some new milk, and as much flour 
of rice as will be necessary to make it of a tolerable thickness. 
Beat three or four eggs, the yolks and whites together, and 
mix them well with the rice and milk. Add to them a pint 
of rich cream, set over a stove, and stir it well. Put in some 
powdered sugar, some candied lemon-peel cut small, and 
some fresh-grated lemon-peel cut very small. Then take all 
the white meat from a roasted chicken, pull it into small 
shreds, put it to the rest of the ingredients, and stir it all to- 
gether. Then take it off", and it will be a very rich paste. 
Roll it out, cut it into small fritters, and fry them iu boiling 
lard. Strew the bottom of the dish with sugar finely powdered. 
Put in the fritters, and shake some sugar over them. 

Hasty Fritters. 

PUT some butter into a stewpan, and let it heat. Take 
half a pint of good ale, and stir into it by degrees a little flour. 
Put in a few currants, or chopped apples, beat them up quick, 
and drop a large spoonful at a time all over the pan. Take 
care that they do not stick together, turn them with an e<rg- 
shce, and when they are a fine brown, lay them on a dish, and 
throw some sugar over them. 



PANCAKES AND FRITTERS. 223 



Fritters. 

HAVING beat the yolks of eight eggs and the whites of 
four well together, strain them into a pan : take a quart of 
cream, and make it scalding hot : add a quarter of a pint 
of sack, three quarters of a pint of ale, and make a posset of 
it. When cool, put it to the eggs, beating it well together. 
Then put in salt, ginger, nutmeg, and flour. Having made 
the batter pretty thick, put in pippins sliced or pared, and 
fry them quick in a good deal of batter. 

Curd Fritters. 

TAKE a handful of curds and a handful of flour, and ten 
eggs well beaten and strained ; some sugar, cloves, mace, and 
nutmeg beaten, and a little saffron. Stir all well together and 
fry them quick, and of a fine light brown. 

Skirret Fritters. 

To a pint of pulp of skirrets add a spoonful of flour, the 
yolks of four eggs, sugar and spice. Make them into a thick 
batter, and fry them quick. 

Syringed Fritters. 

To a pint of water add a piece of butter of the size of an 
egg, with some lemon-peel, rasped preserved lemon-peel, 
and crisped orange-flowers. Put all together in a stewpan 
'over the fire, and, when boiling, throw in some fine flour. 
Keep it stirring, put more flour in by degrees, till the batter is 
thick enough, and then take it off the fire. Take an ounce 
of sweet almonds, four bitter ones, and pound them in a 
mortar. Stir in two Naples biscuits crumbled, and two eggs 
beaten. Stir all together, and put in more eggs till the bat- 
ter is thin enough to be syringed. Fill the syringe, the bat- 
ter being hot, then syringe the fritters in it, to make it of a 
true-lover's-knot, and being well coloured, serve them up for 
a side dish. Or, rub a sheet of paper with butter, over which 
syringe the fritters, and make them of the required shape : 
the butter being hot, turn the paper upside down over it, and 
the fritters will easily drop off". When fried, strew them with 
sugar, and glaze them. 

Vine-leaf Fritters. 

HAVING procured some of the smallest vine-leaves, and 
having cut otf the great stalks, put them into a dish with 



224- PANCAKES AND FRITTERS. 

some French brandy, green lemon rasped, and some sugar. 
Take a good handful of fine flour, mixed with white wine or 
ale: let the batter be hot, and with a spoon drop it in, and 
take great care that they do not stick to each other. On each 
fritter lay a leaf, then fry them quick, and strew sugar over 

them. Glaze them with a salamander. 

> 

Clary Fritters. 

CUT off the stalks of the clary leaves, and dip them one by 
one in a batter made with milk and flour. The batter being 
hot, fry them quick.

CHAPTER I. 



PICKLING. 



PRELIMINARY HINTS AND OBSERVATIONS. 

IT is an essential point with the housekeeper, to take care 
never to be without pickles of her own preparing, that she 
may not be obliged to purchase them at shops, where they 
are often badly prepared, and made to please the eye by the 
use of pernicious ingredients. It is too common a practice to 
make use of brass utensils, in order to give the pickles a fine 
green ; but the same purpose might be effected by heating 
the liquor, and keeping it in a proper degree of warmth on the 
hearth or the chimney corner. By this method you would 
avoid the pernicious consequence of the use of brass utensils, 
or of verdigris of any kind, which are in their nature a very 
powerful poison. Stone jars are undoubtedly the best for 
keeping all sorts of pickles ; for, though they are expensive 
on the first purchase, yet they will, in the end, be found 
much cheaper than earthen vessels, through which, it has 
been found by experience, salt and vinegar will penetrate, 
especially when put in hot. When you take any pickle out 
of your jars, be sure never to do it wrth your fingers, as that 
will spoil your pickle ; but always make use of a spoon for 
that purpose. We shall now proceed to give an account of 
the different kind of spices made use of in pickling, as well as 
of vinegars, &c. &c. 

Pepper: 

OF every kind, should be kept ground, in bottles withglas? 
stoppers the whole pepper in jars, tied over with bladder. 



22$ PICKLING. 



Ginger, Cloves, Nutmegs, Mace, Cinnamon, and Allspice^ 
should be treated, as directed for Pepper. 

Common Vinegar. 

PUT as many pounds of coarse Lisbon sugar as gallons of 
water; boil it, and skim it as long as any scum will rise: 
then put it into tubs, and when it is as cold as beer to work, 
toast a large piece of bread, and rub it over with yeast. Let 
it work twenty-four hours ; then have ready a vessel, iron- 
hooped, and well painted, fixed in a place where the sun has 
full power, and fix it so as not to have any occasion to move 
it. When it is drawn off, fill the vessels, and lay a tile on the 
bung-hole to keep the dust out. Make it in March, and it 
will be fit to use in. June or July. Then draw it off into little 
stone bottles, let it stand till wanted for use, and it will never 
be foul any more ; but should it not be sour enough, let it 
stand a month longer before it is drawn off. 



Elder-Flower Vinegar. 

PUT two gallons of strong vinegar to a peck of the peeps 
of elder flowers, and so in proportion for any greater quan- 
tity. Set it in the sun in a stone jar for a fortnight, and then 
filter it through a flannel bag. When it is drawn off, put it 
into small bottles, in which it will preserve its flavour better 
than in large ones. In mixing the flowers and the vinegar 
together, be careful not to drop any of the stalks among the 
peeps. 

Gooseberry Vinegar. 

CIIUSH the ripest gooseberries in a tub, and to every peck 
of gooseberries put two gallons of water. Mix them well to- 
gether, and let them work for three weeks. Stir them up 
three or four times a day, then strain the liquor through a hair 
sieve, and put to every gallon a pound of brown sugar, a 
pound of treacle, a spoonful of fresh barm, and let it work 
three or four days in the sanxj tub well washed. Run it into 
iron-hooped barrels, let it stand twelve months, and then draw 
it into bottles for use. This is far superior to white-wine 
vinegar. 

Tarragon Vinegar. 

STRIP off the leaves of tarragon just as it is going into 
bloom, and to every pound of leaves put a gallon of strong 
white-wine vinegar in a stone jug, to ferment for a fortnight- 



PICKLING. 227 

Then fun it through a flannel bag, and to every four gallons 
of vinegar put half an ounce of isinglass dissolved in cyder. 
Mix it well, put it into large bottles, and let it stand a month 
to fine. Then rack it off into pint bottles, and use it as it is 
wanted. 

Sugar Vinegar. 

To six gallons of water put nine pounds of brown suo-ar, 
and so in proportion for any greater quantity. Boil it for a 
quarter of an hour, and put it lukewarm into a tub. Put to it 
a pint of new barm, and let it work four or five days. Stir it 
up three or four times a day, then turn it into a clean iron- 
hooped barrel, and set it in the sun. If made in February, it 
will be fit for use in August. It may be used for most sorts of 
pickles, except mushrooms and walnuts. This is nearly the 
same as that mentioned under the title of Common Vinegar. 



Cucumbers, catted Gerkins. 

THE cucumbers must be as free from spots as possible, and 
of the smallest size. Put them into strong salt arid water for 
nine or ten days, or till they are quite yellow, and stir them 
twice a day at least, or they will grow soft. When perfectly 
yellow, pour the water from them, and cover them with plenty 
of vine leaves. Set the water over the fire, and when it boils 
pour it upon them, and set them upon the hearth to keep 
warm : when the water is nearly cold, make it boiling hot 
again, and pour it upon them. Proceed in this manner till 
they are of a fine green, which they will be in four or five 
times. Be careful to keep them well covered with vine 
leaves, with a cloth and dish over the top to keep in the steam, 
Avhich will help to green them the sooner. 

When greened, put them in a hair sieve to drain, and make 
the following pickle for them : To every two quarts of white 
wine vinegar, put a quarter of an ounce of mace, ten OF 
twelve cloves, an ounce of ginger cut into slices, the same 
of black pepper, and a handful of salt : boil all together for 
five minutes, pour it hot upon the pickles, and tie them down 
with a bladder for use. A clove of garlic may be added. 

Cucumbers in Slices. 

SLICE some large cucumbers before they are too ripe, and 
put them into an earthen pan. To every dozen of cucum- 
bers, slice two large onions, putting a handful of salt between 
every row: cover them with a dish, and let them stand 
twenty-four hours : put them into a cullender, and let them 

Q 2 



228 PICKLING. 

dry well ; put them into a jar, cover them over with white- 
wine vinegar, and let them stand four hours : pour the vine- 
gar from them into a saucepan, and boil it with a little salt, 
mace, whole pepper, a large race of ginger sliced, and then 
pour on them the boiling vinegar. Cover them close, and 
when they are cold, tie them down, and if wanted for use in 
a few days, reboil the vinegar. 

Walnuts pickled black. 

YOUR Avalnuts must be taken from the tree before the shell 
is hard, which may be known by running a pin into them, 
and always gather them when the sun is hot upon them. Put 
them into strong salt and water for nine days, and stir them 
twice a day, observing to change the salt and water every 
three days. Then put them into a hair sieve, and let them 
stand in the air till they turn black. Put them into strong 
stone jars, and pour boiling vinegar over them. Cover them 
up, and let them stand till cold. Then give the vinegar three 
more boilings, pour it each time on the walnuts, and let it 
stand till cold between every boiling. Then tie them down 
with paper and a bladder over them, and let them stand two 
months. Having stood that time, take them out of the vine- 
gar, and make for them the following pickle : To every two 
quarts of vinegar, put a quarter of an ounce of mace, a dram 
of cloves ; of olacK pepper, of Jamaica pepper, ginger, and 
long pepper, an ounce each, and two ounces of common salt. 
Boil ten minutes, pour it hot on the walnuts, and tie them 
down, covered with paper, and a bladder. This quantity of 
spice, is intended for three hundred walnuts. 

Walnuts pickled white. 

HAVING procured a sufficient quantity of walnuts of the 
largest size, and taken the above precautions that their shells 
are not hard, pare them very thin till the white appear, and 
throw them into spring-water, with a handful of salt. Let 
them stand in that water for six hours, and put a thin board 
upon them to keep them under the water. Then set on a 
stewpan, with some clean spring-water on a charcoal fire. 
Take the nuts put of the water, put them into the stewpan, 
and let them simmer four or five minutes, but not boil : have 
ready a pan of spring-water, with a handful of white salt in it, 
stir it till the salt is melted, take the nuts out of the stewpan 
with a wooden ladle or spoon, and put them into the cold 
water and salt. Let them stand a quarter of an hour, with the 
board lying on them to keep them down as before ; for if 
they are not kept under the liquor they will turn black. 



PICKLING. 129 

Then lay them on a cloth, and cover them with another to 
dry ; carefully rub them with a soft cloth, and put them into 
the jar, with some blades of mace and nutmeg sliced thin. 
*Mix the spice between the nuts, and pour distilled vinegar 
over them. When the jar is full of nuts, pour mutton fat 
over them, and tie them close down with a bladder and lea- 
ther, to keep out the air. 

Walnuts pickled of an Olive-colour. 

HAVING gathered the walnuts with the same precautions as 
above directed, put them into strong vinegar, and tie them 
down under a bladder and paper to keep out the air. Let 
them stand twelve months, then take them out of the vine- 
gar, and make for them a pickle of strong vinegar. To every 
quart, put half an ounce of Jamaica pepper, the same of long 
pepper, a quarter of an ounce of mace, the same of cloves, a 
head of garlic, and a little salt. Boil them all together five 
or six minutes, and then pour it upon the walnuts. As it gets 
cold, boil it again three times, and pour it on the walnuts. 
Tie them down with a bladder and paper over it ; and if your 
vinegar be good, they will keep several years, without either 
turning colour or growing soft. 

Walnuts pickled green. 

FOR this purpose, make choice of the large double or 
French walnuts, gathered before the shells are hard. Wrap 
them singly in vine leaves, put a few vine leaves in the bot- 
tom of the jar, and nearly fill it with walnuts. Take care that 
they do not touch. one another, and put a good many leaves 
over them. Then fill your jar with good vinegar, cover them 
close that the air cannot get in, and let them stand for three 
weeks. Pour the vinegar from them, put fresh leaves on the 
bottom of another jar, take out the walnuts, and wrap them 
separately in fresh leaves, as quickly as possible. Put them 
into the jar with a good many leaves over them, and fill it 
with white-wine vinegar. Let them stand three weeks, pour 
off the vinegar, and wrap them as before with fresh leaves at 
the bottom and top of the jar. Take fresh white-wine vine- 
gar, put salt in it till it will bear an egg, and add to it mace, 
cloves, nutmeg and garlic. Boil it about eight minutes, and 
then pour it on the walnuts. Tie them close with paper and 
a bladder, and set them by for use. 

Kidney Beans, 

PUT some young and small beans into a strong salt and 
water for three days, stirring them two or three times each 



23.O PICKLING. 

day. Then put them into a pan, with vine leaves both under 
and over them, and pour on the.n the same water they came 
out of. Cover them close, and set them over a very slow fire 
till they are of a very fine green. Put them into a hair sieve 
to drain, and make a pickle for them of white-wine vinegar. 
Boil it five or six minutes with a little mace, Jamaica pep- 
per, long pepper, and a race or two of ginger sliced, pour it 
hot upon the beans, and tie them down with a bladder and 
paper. 

Mangoes. 

CUCUMBERS used for this purpose must be of the largest 
sort, and taken from the vines before they are too ripe, oryel- 
low at the ends. Cut a piece out of the side, and take out 
the seeds with an apple -scraper, or a tea-spoon. Then put 
them into very strong salt and water for eight or nine days, 
or till they are very yellow. Stir them well two or three 
times each day, and put them into a pan with a large quan- 
tity of vine leaves both over and under them. Beat a little 
ailum very fine and put it into the salt and water they came 
out of. Pour it on the cucumbers, and set it upon a very 
slow fire for four or five hours, till they are pretty green : 
take them out, and drain them in a hair sieve, and when cold, 
put to them a little horse-radish, then mustard-seed, two or 
three heads of garlic, a few pepper-corns, a few green cu- 
cumbers sliced in small pieces, then horse-radish, and the 
same as before-mentioned, till they are filled. Take the 
piece cut out from the side, and sew it on with a large needle 
and thread, and do all the rest in the same manner. Have 
ready the following pickle : To every gallon of vinegar put a 
quarter of an ounce of mace, the same of cloves, two ounces 
of sliced ginger, the same of long pepper, Jamaica pepper, 
and black pepper ; three ounces of mustard-seed tied up in a 
bag, four ounces of garlic, and a stick of horse-radish cut in 
slices. Boil them five minutes in the vinegar, then pour it 
upon the pickles, tie them down, and keep them for use. 

Codlins. 

Youn codlins must be gathered when they are about the 
size of a large French walnut. Put them into a pan with a 
great many vine-leaves at the bottom, and cover them well 
with the vine-leaves. Set them over a very slow fire till the 
skin will peel, and take them carefully up in a hair sieve ; t 
peel them with a pen-knife, and put them into the same pot 
again, with the vine-leaves and water as before. Cover them 



PICKLING. 231 

close, and set them over a slow fire till they are of a fine 
green : drain them through a hair sieve, and when C9ld, put 
them into distilled vinegar. Pour a little mutton fat on the 
top, and with a bladder and paper tie them down close. 

Golden Pippins. 

HAVING procured fine pippins, free from spots and bruises, 
put them into a preserving-pan, with cold spring water, and 
set them on a' charcoal fire. Keep them stirring with a 
wooden spoon, till they will peel, but do not let them boil. 
When enough, peel them, and put them into the water again, 
with a quarter of a pint of the best vinegar, and a quarter of 
an ounce of alum. Cover them close, and set them on the 
charcoal fire again, but do not let them boil. Let them stand, 
turning them now and then, till they look green : then take 
them out, and lay them on a cloth to cool. When cold, put 
to them the following pickle : To every gallon of vinegar put 
two ounces of mustard seeds, two or three heads of garlic, a 
good deal of ginger sliced, half an ounce of cloves, a dram of 
mace and nutmeg. Mix the pickle well together, pour it over 
the pippins, and cover them close, 

Peaches, Nectarines, and Apricots, 

MUST be gathered when they are at their full growth, and 
just before they turn ripe, and be sure that they are not 
bruised. Take as much spring water as will cover them, and 
make it salt enough to bear an egg, for which purpose use 
an equal quantity of bay and common salt: lay in the peaches, 
and put a thin board over them to keep them under the water. 
Let them stand three days, then take them out, wipe them 
.very carefully with a fine soft cloth, and lay them in the jar. 
Then take as much white-wine vinegar as will fill the jar, 
and to every gallon put one pint of the best well made mus- 
tard, two or three heads of garlic, a good deal of ginger 
sliced, and two drams of cloves, mace, and nutmegs. Mix 
the pickle well together, and pour it over the peaches. Tie 
them up close, and they will be fit to eat in two months. Nec- 
tarines and apricots are pickled in the same manner. 

Berberries. 

HAVING procured berberries that are not over ripe, pick 
off the leaves and dead stalks, and put them into jars, with a 
large quantity of strong salt and water, and tie them down 
with a bladder. When a scum rises, put them into fresh salt 
and water, but they need no vinegar, their own sharpness being 
fully sufficient to preserve them. 



2Sf PICKLINO. 



Radish Pods. 

PUT the radish pods, which must be gathered when they 
are quite young, into salt and water all night : boil the salt 
and water they were laid in, pour it upon the pods, and cover 
the jar close to keep in the steam. When it is nearly cold, 
make it boiling hot, and pour it on again, and keep doing so 
till the pods are quite green. Then put them into a sieve to 
drain, and make a pickle for them of white-wine vinegar, 
with a little mace, ginger, long pepper, and horse-radish. 
Pour it boiling hot upon the pods, and when it is almost 
cold, make the vinegar twice as hot as before, and pour it 
upon them. Tie them down with a bladder, and put them 
by for use. 

-Beet Roots. 

BOIL the roots till tender, take off the skins, cut them in 
slices, gimp them in the shape of wheels, or any other form, 
and put them into a jar. Take as much vinegar as will cover 
them, and boil it with a little mace, a race of ginger sliced, 
and a few slices of horse-radish. Pour it hot upon the roots, 
and tie them down. 

Parsley pickled green. 

MAKE a strong salt and water that will bear an egg, and 
throw into it a large quantity of curled parsley. Let it stand 
a week, then take it out to drain, make a fresh-salt and water 
as before, and let it stand another week. Drain it well, put it 
into spring water, and change it three days successively. 
Then scald it in hard water till it becomes ^reen, take it out 
and drain it quite dry, and boil a quart of distilled vinegar a 
few minutes, with two or three blades of mace, a nutmeg 
sliced, and a shalot or two. When quite cold, pour it on the 
parsley, with two or three slices of horse-radish, and keep it 
for use. 

Elder Buds. 

HAVING procured elder buds, gathered when thev are about 
the size of hop buds, put them into strong salt and water for 
nine days, and stir them two or three times a day. Then put 
them into a pau, cover them with vine-leaves/ and pour on 
them the water they came out of. Set them over a slow fire 
till they are quite green, and then make a pickle for them 
of vinegar, a little mace, a few shalots, and some ginger

sliced. Boil them two or three minutes, and pour it upon 
the buds. Tie them down, and keep them in a dry place foi 1 
use. 

Elder Shoots, 

PUT the elder shoots, which must be gathered when they 
are of the thickness of a pipe shank, into salt and water all 
night. Then put them into stone jars in layers, and between 
every layer strew a little mustard seed, scraped horse-radish, 
a few shalots, a little white beet-root, and a cauliflower pulled 
into small pieces. Then pour boiling vinegar upon them, and 
scald them three times. Keep in a dry place, with a leather 
tied over them. 

Nasturtiums. 

PUT the nasturtium berries, which must be gathered soon 
after the blossoms are gone off, into cold salt and water, and 
change the water for three days successively. Make the pickle 
of white-wine vinegar, mace, nutmeg sliced, shalots, pepper- 
corns, salt and horse-radish. The pickle must be made pretty 
strong, as it must not be boiled. When the berries are drained, 
put them into ajar, and pour the pickle to them. 

Grapes. 

LET the grapes be of their full growth, but not ripe. Cut 
them into small bunches fit for garnishing, and put them into 
a stone jar with vine-leaves between every layer of grapes : 
take spring water,- as much us will cover them, put into it a 
pound of bay-salt, and as much white salt.as will make it bear 
an egg. Dry the bay-salt and pound it before it is added, 
as that will make it melt the sooner. Put it into a pot, and 
boil and skim it well; but take off only the black scum. When 
it has boiled a quarter of an hour, let it stand to cool and 
settle ; and when almost cold pour the clear liquor on the 
grapes, lay vine-leaves on the top, tie them down close with 
a linen cloth, and cover them with a dish. Let them stand 
twenty-four hours, then take them out, lay them on a cloth, 
cover them over with another, and let them dry between the 
cloths. Then take two quarts of vinegar, a quart of spring 
water, and a pound of coarse sugar. Let ic boil a little, 
skim it very clean as it boils, and let it stand till quite cold. 
Dry the jar with a cloth, put fresh vine-leaves at the bottom, 
and between every bunch of grapes and on the top. Then 
pour the clear of the pickle on the grapes, fill the jar that the 
pickle may be above the grapes, and having tied a thin piece 
of board in a piece of flannel, lay it on the top of the jar, to 



PICKLING. 

keep the grapes under the liquor. Tie them down with a 
blaoder and a leather, and when wanted for use, take them 
out with a wooden spoon. 

Cauliflowers. 

PULL the whitest and closest cauliflowers into bunches, and 
spread them on an earthen dish. Lay salt all over them, and 
let them stand for three days to bring out all the water. Then 
put them into jars, and pour boiling salt and water upon them. 
Let them stand! all night, then drain them into a hair sieve, and 
put them into glass jars. Fill up the jars with distilled vine- 
gar, and tie them down close. 

Red Cabbage. 

HAVING sliced the cabbage cross-ways, put it on an earthen 
dish, and sprinkle a handful of salt over it. Cover it with ano- 
ther dish, and let it stand twenty-four hours. Then put it into 
a cullender to drain, and lay it into the jar. Take white-wine 
vinegar enough to cover it, a little cloves, mace, and allspice. 
Put them in whole, with a little cochineal bruised fine. Then 
boil it up, and put it hot on the cabbage. Cover it close with 
a cloth till cold, and tie it up close. 

Indian Pickle, or Piccalillo. 

TAKE large fresh cauliflowers in the month of July, pick 
them in small pieces, take also white cabbages cut in half 
quarters, whole French beans, heads of celery, heads of as- 
paragus scraped, onions whole and sliced, pickling melons 
peeled thin and cut in halves, and wash them clean : put them 
into a pan with plenty of salt over them for three days ; then 
drain, and lay them thin, to dry in the sun, repeatedly turn- 
ing them. Then put plenty of whole ginger, slices of horse- 
radish, peeled garJic, and whole long pepper into salt and 
water for one night ; drain and dry them also ; and then boil 
more than sufficient vinegar to cover them, to every two 
quarts adding an ounce of turmeric, and a quarter of an ounce 
of cayenne : having put the vegetables, &c. into stone jars, 
pour the boiling vinegar over them, letting them stand close 
covered till next day ; repeat this process the two following 
days, and cover them with bladder and leather. 

Sour Crout. 

TAKE large white cabbages when in season, cut them into 
halves, and these into slips ; wash clean, and drain dry : put 
into a tub a layer of cabbage, and a layer of salt, with a few 



PICKLING. 235 

-coriander seeds pounded and sifted very fine, and so alternately 
till it is nearly full : lay upon it a board that will nearly fit it, 
and upon that a he?.vy weight to press it well : set it in a cool 
dry place, and cover with a cloth. 

Mode of dressing Sour Crout. 

PUT the prepared cabbage into boiling water over a fire 
for five minutes, and strain it: have ready, an equal number 
of pieces of 'brisket of beef, and pickled pork, each weigh- 
ing about a quaiter of a pound, and all nearly boiled enough; 
put them into a stewpan, add the cabbage, some fresh butter, 
a little vinegar, onions sliced thin, whole pepper, allspice, 
and ny'ce ..ii tied in a bit of muslin : let all stew till tender, 
take 6!Tt the sp : ce, season with cayenne, and serve with fried 
onions, and fried sausages round. 

Mushrooms. 

TAKE a sufficient quantity of double distilled vinegar to 
cover the mushrooms; add whole white pepper, ginger, mace, 
esciialois, and a small quantity of garlic peeled; boil ten 
minuter, and let it stand till cold closely covered: peel fresh 
buttons, wash, clean, strain, and put them into a stewpan : to 
each quart of mushrooms, add the juice of a lemon strained, 
and a tabL' spoonful of salt: cover the stewpan close, set it 
over the fire, and when the liquor is sufficiently drawn from 
the mushrooms, put the whole into small glasses, and cover 
them with the pickle, and tie with bladder. 

Artichokes, 

TAKE young artichokes as soon as they are formed, and 
boil them for two or three minutes in strong salt and water. 
Lay them upon a hair sieve to drain, and when cold, put 
them into narrow-topped jars : take as much white-wine vine- 
gar as will cover the artichokes. Boil them with a blade or 
two of mace, a few slices of ginger, and a nutmeg cut thin. 
Pour it on them while it is hot, and tie them down close. 

Artichoke. Bottoms. 

BOIL the artichokes till the leaves can be pulled off; take 
off the chokes, and cut them from the stalk ; but take great 
care not to let the knife touch the top. Throw them into salt 
and water for an hour, take them out, and lay liiem on a 
cloth to drain. As soon as they are dry put them into large 
wide-mouthed glasses, tvith a little mace and sliced nutmeg 
between, and fill them either with distilled vinegar, or sugar- 



P/CKLING. 

vinegar and spring-water. Cover them with mutton fat fried, 
and tie them down with a leather and a bladder. 

Onions. 

TAKE a sufficient number of the smallest onions, and put 
them into salt and water for nine days, observing to change 
the water every day: put them into jars, and pour fresh boil- 
ing salt and water over them. Let them stand close covered 
until cold, then make some more salt and water, and pour it 
boiling hot upon them. When cold, put the onions into a 
hair sieve to drain, then put them into wide-mouthed bottles, 
and fill them up with distilled vinegar. Put into every bot- 
tle a slice or two of ginger, a blade of mace, and a large tea- 
spoonful of eating oil, which will keep the onions white. If 
the taste of a bay-leaf is approved, put one or two into every 
bottle, and as much bay-salt as will lie on a sixpence. Cork 
them up well. 



Caveach, or pickled Mackerel. &ZG Frugal Dishes. 
Indian Bamboo imitated. 

ABOUT the beginning or middle of May, take the middle 
of the stalks of the young shoots of elder, for the tops of the 
shoots are not worth doing. Peel off the out rind, and lay 
them all night in a strong brine of salt and beer. Dry them 
singly in a cloth, and in the meantime make a pickle of an. 
equal quantity of gooseberry vinegar and wine vinegar. To 
every quart of pickle put an ounce of long pepper, the same 
quantity of sliced ginger, a few corns of Jamaica pepper, and 
a little mace. Boil it, and pour it hot upon the shoots. Stop 
the jar close, and set it by the fire-side for twenty-four hours, 
taking care to stir it frequently. 

Asparagus. 

CUT off the white ends of the largest asparagus, and wash 
the green ends in spring water : put them into another clean 
water, and let them lie therein two or three hours. Put into 
a broad stewpan, full of spring water, a large handful of salt, 
set it on the fire, and when it boils, put in tne asparagus, not 
tied up, but loose, and not too many at a time. Just scald 
them, and no more ; then take them out with a broad skim- 
mer, and lay them on a cloth to cool : make the pickle with a 
gallon or more, according to the quantity of asparagus, of 
white-wine vinegar and an ounce of bay-salt. Boil it, and 
put the asparagus into the jar. To a gallon of pickle put two 
nutmegs, a quarter of an ounce of mace, and the same quan- 



PICKLING. 237 

tity of whole white pepper. Pour the pickle hot over the 
asparagus, and cover them with a linen cloth, three or four 
times double : and when they have stood a week, boil the 
pickle again. Let them stand a week longer, then boil the 
pickle again, and pour it on hot as before. When they are 
cold, cover them close, in the same manner as other pickles. 

Ox Palates. ' 

WASH the palates well with salt and water, and put them 
into a saucepan with some clean salt and water ; when ready 
to boil, skim them well, and put to them as much pepper, 
cloves, and mace, as will give them a quick taste. When 
boiled tender, which will require four or five hours, peel 
them, and cut them into small pieces, and let them cool. 
Then make the pickle of an equal quantity of white wine and 
vinegar. Boil the pickle, ana put in the spices that were 
boiled in the palates. When both the pickle and palates are 
cold, lay the palates in a jar, and put to them a few bay- 
leaves, and a little fresh spice. Pour the pickle over them, 
cover them close, and keep them for use. They are very 
useful to put into made dishes ; or you may at any time make 
a pretty little dish, either with brown sauce or white, or but- 
ter ana mustard, and a spoonful of white wine. 

Samphire. 

LAY green samphire into a clean pan, and throw over it 
two or three handfuls of salt ; then cover it with spring water. 
Let it lay twenty-four hours, then put into a clean saucepan, 
throw in a handiul of salt, and cover it with good vinegar. 
Cover the pan close, and set it over a slow fire. Let it stand 
till just green and crisp, and take it off at that moment ; for 
if it should remain till soft, it will be spoiled. Put it in the 
pickling pot, and cover it close. As soon as cold, tie it down 
with a bladder and leather, and keep it for use ; or it may be 
preserved all the year, in a very strong brine of salt and 
water; throw it into vinegar just before it is used. 

Red Currants. 

TAKE white-wine vinegar, and to every quart of vinegar 
put in half a pound of Lisbon sugar. Then pick the worst 
of the currants, and put them into this liquor ; but put the 
best into glasses : boil the pickle with the worst of the cur- 
rants, and ^skim it very clean. Boil it till it looks of a fine 
colour, and let stand till cold before it is strained ; strain it 
through a cloth, wringing it, to get all the colour from the 



238 PICKLING. 

currants. Let it stand to cool and settle ; then pour it clean 
into the glasses in a little of the pickle ; and when cold, cover 
it close with a bladder and leather. To every half pound of 
sugar put a quarter of a pound of white salt. 

Smelts: 

WHEN smelts are in great plenty, take a quarter of a peck 
of them, and wash, clean, arid g-jt them : take half an ounce 
of pepper, the same quantity of nutmegs, a quarter of an 
ounce of mace, half an ounce of salt-petre, and a quarter of 
a pound of common salt. Beat all very fine, and then lay 
the smelts in rows in a jar. Between every layer of smelts 
strew the seasoning with four or five bay -leaves ; then boil 
red wine, and pour over them a sufficient quantity to cover 
them. Cover them with a plate ; and when cold, stop them 
down close. Many people prefer them to anchovies. 

Anchovies. 

ARTIFICIAL anchovies are made in this manner : To a peck 
of sprats, take two pounds of common salt, a quarter of a 
pound of bay-salt, four of salt-petre, two ounces of prunella 
salt, and a small quantity of cochineal. Pound all in a mor- 
tar, put them into a stone pan, a row of sprats, then a layer 
of the compound, and so on alternately to the top. Press 
them hard down, cover them close, let them stand for six 
months, and they will be fit for use. Take particular care 
that the sprats are very fresh, and do not wash or wipe them, 
but take them just as they come out of the water. 

Oysters, Cockles, and Muscles. 

TAKE two hundred of the newest and best oysters, and 
be careful to save the liquor in a pan as they are opened. 
Cut off the black verge, saving the rest, and put them into 
their own liquor ; then put all the liquor and oysters into a 
kettle, boil them about half an hour on a gentle fire, and do 
them very slowly, skimming them as the scum rises; then 
take them off the fire, take out the oysters, and strain the 
liquor through a fine cloth: put in the oysters again, take out 
a pint of the liquor when hot, and add to it a quarter of an 
ounce of mace, and the same of cloves : just give it one boil, 
put it to the oysters, and stir up the spices well among them ; 
then put in about a spoonful of salt, three quarters of a pint 
of the best white-wine vinegar, and a quarter of an ounce of 
whole pepper. Then let them stand till cold, and put the. 
oysters into a barrel. Put in as much liquor as the barrel 



COLLARING. 239 

hold, letting them settle a while, and they will soon be fit to 
eat ; or put them into stone jars, cover them close Avith a 
bladder and leather, and be sure they are quite cold before 
they are covered up. In the like manner do cockles and 
muscles, with this difference only, that there is not any thing 
to be picked off cockles, and as they are small, the above in- 
gredients will be sufficient for two quarts of muscles, but 
take great care to pick out the crabs under the tongues of 
the muscles, and the little pus which grows at the root of the 
tongue. Cockles and muscles must be washed in several 
waters to clean them from the grit. Put them in a stewpan 
by themselves, cover them close, and when they open, pick 
them out of the shells, and strain the liquor. 

Salmon. 

CLEAN the fish carefully, boil it gently till done, and then 
take it up: strain the liquor, adding bay-leaves, peppercorns, 
and salt; give it a boil, and when cold, add vinegar to the 
palate, and pour over the fish. 



CHAPTER II. 
COLLARING. 

PRELIMINARY HINTS AND OBSERVATIONS. 

LT is a necessary article in collaring, to take care that you 
roll it up properly, and bind it close. Be cautious that you 
boil it thoroughly enough ; and when quite cold, put it into 
the pickle with the same binding it had on when boiled ; but 
take it off the next day, and it will leave the skin clear. Make 
fresh pickle frequently, which will preserve your meat much 
longer. 

Beef. 

BONE a piece of thick flank of beef, cut the skin off, and 
salt it with two ounces of saltpetre, two ounces of sal-pru- 
nella, the same quantity of bay-salt, half a pound of coarse 
sugar, and two pounds of white salt. Beat the hard salts 
fine, and mix all together. Turn it every day, and rub it 
well with the brine "for eight days ; then take it out of the 
pickle, wash it, and wipe it dry. Take a quarter of an ounce 



f40 COLLARING. 

of cloves, the same quantity of mace, twelve corns of allspice, 
and a nutmeg beat very fine, with a spoonful of beaten pep- 
per, a large quantity of chopped parsley, and some sweet 
herbs chopped fine. Sprinkle it on the beef, and roll it up 
very tight; put a coarse cloth round it, and tie it very tight 
with tape. Boil it in a large copper of water ; and if a large 
collar, it will take six hours boiling; but a small one will be 
done in five. Take it out, and put it in a press till cold ; or 
between two boards, and a large weight upon it. 

Breast of Veal, 

TAKE a breast of veal, bone it, and beat it a little. Rub it 
over with the yolk of an egg, and strew over it a little beaten 
mace, nutmeg, pepper and salt ; a large handful of parsley 
chopped small, with a few sprigs of sweet marjoram, a little 
lemon peel finely shred, an anchovy washed, boned, and chop- 
ped very small, and mixed with a few crumbs of bread : roll it 
up very tight, bind it hard with a fillet, and wrap it in a clean 
cloth ; then boil it two hours and a half in salt water ; and 
when enough, hang it up by one end, and make a pickle for 
it: to a pint of salt and water put half a pint of vinegar; and 
when sent to table, cut a slice off one of th ends. 

Breast of Mutton. 

TAKE off the skin of a breast of mutton, and with a sharp 
knife nicely take out all the bones ; but take care not to cut 
through the meat. Pick all the fat and meat off the bones, 
then grate some nutmeg all over the inside of the mutton, a 
very Tittle beaten mace, a little pepper and salt, a few sweet 
herbs shred small, a few crumbs of bread, and the bits of fat 
picked off the bones. Roll it up tight, stick a skewer in to 
hold it together, but do it in such a manner that the collar may 
stand upright in the dish. Tie a packthread across it, to hold 
it together; spit it ; then roll the caul of a breast of veal all 
round it, and roast. When it has been about an hour at the 
fire, take off the caul, dredge it with flour, baste it well \\ith 
fresh butter, and let it be of a fine brown. It will require on 
the whole, an hour and a quarter roasting. For sauce, take 
some stock and coulis well seasoned. 

Or, bone a large breast of mutton, and take out all the 
gristles. Rub it all over with the yolk of an egg, and season 
it with pepper, salt, nutmeg, parsley, thyme, sweet marjoram, 
all shred small, and shalot if approved. Wash and cut an 
anchovy in bits. Strew all this over the meat, roll it up hard, 
tie it with a tape, and put it into a ewpan ; brown it, add 



COLLARING. 241 

some gravy well seasoned, and thicken it with flour and 
butter. Add some truffles and morels, or pickled cucumbers, 
or girkins sliced. 

Calf's Head. 

TAKE off the hair of a calf's head, but leave on the skin. 
Rip it do\vn the face, and take out "all the bones carefully 
from the meat. Steep it in warm milk till it is white, then lay 
it flat, rub it with the white of an egg, and strew over it a 
spoonful of white pepper, two or three blades of beaten mace, 
a nutmeg grated, a spoonful of salt, two score of oysters 
chopped small, half a pound of beef marrow, and a large 
handful of parsley. Lay them all over the inside of the 
head, cut o(F the ears, and lay them on a thin part of the 
head : roll it up tight, bind it up with a fillet, and wrap it up 
in a clean cloth. Boil it two hours ; and when almost cold, 
bind it up with a fresh fillet, and put it in a pickle made, as- 
before directed, for a breast of veal. 

Pig. 

HAVING killed your pig, dress oil the hair, and draw out 
the entrails. Then wash it clean, and with a sharp knife rip 
it open, and take out all the bones; then rub it all over with 
pepper and salt beaten fine, a few sage-leaves, and sweet herbs 
chopped small; then roll up your pig tight,- and bind it with 
a fillet. Fill your boiler with soft water, a bunch of sweet 
herbs, a few pepper-corns, a blade or two of mace, eight or 
ten cloves, a handful of salt, and a pint of vinegar. When it 
boils put in your pig, and let it boil till it is tender. Then 
take it up ; and when it is almost cold, bind it over again, put 
it into an earthen pot, and pour the liquor your pig was boiled 
in upon it. Remember to keep it covered. 

Venison. 

TAKE a side of venison, bone it, and take away all the 
sinews, and cut it into square collars. It will make two or 
three collars. Lard it with fat clear bacon, and cut the lards 
as big as the top of the finger, and three or four inches long. 
Season the venison with pepper, salt, cloves, and nutmeg. 
Roll up the collars, and tie them close with coarse tape; then 
put them into deep pots, with seasonings at the bottoms, some 
fresh butter, and three or four bay-leaves ; then put in the 
rest, with some seasoning and butter on the top, and over 
that some beef suet finely shred and beaten ; cover up the 
pot with coarse paste, and bake them four or five hours. 

R 



242 COLLARING. 

After that, take them out of the oven, and let them stand a 
little. Take out the venison, and let it drain well from the 
gravy. Take off all the fat from the gravy, add more butter 
to the fat, and set it over a gentle fire to clarify. Then take 
it off, and let it stand a little and skim it well. Make the 
pots clean, or have pots ready fit for each collar. Put a little 
seasoning, and some of the clarified butter at .the bottom : 
then put in the venison, and fill up the pots with clarified 
butter, and be sure the butter is an inch above the meat. 
When thoroughly cold, tie it down with double paper, and 
lay a tile on the top. They will keep six or eight months ; 
and when a pot is wanted, put it for a minute into boiling 
water, and it will come out whole. Let it stand till cold, 
stick it round with bay-leaves, and a sprig ^t the top. 

Eds. 

CUT the eel open, take out the bones, cut off the head and 
tail, and lay the eel flat on the dresser. Shred some sage 
as fine as possible, and mix it with black pepper beaten, some 
nutmeg grated, and some salt. Lay it ali over the eel, and 
roll it up hard in little cloths, tying it up tight at each end. 
Then set on some water, with pepper and salt, five or six 
cloves, three or four blades of mace, and a bay-leaf or two. 
Boil these, with the bones, head, and tail j then take out the 
bones, head, and tail, and put in the eels. Let them boil till 
tender, then take them out of the liquor, and boil the liquor 
longer. Take it off; and when cold put it to the eels ; but 
do not take off the little cloths till the collars are used. 

Salmon. 

TAKE a side of salmon, and cut off about a handful of the 
tail. Wash well the large piece, and dry it with a cloth. 
Wash it over with the yolks of eggs, and make some force- 
meat with what was cutoff the tail ; but take off the skin, and 
put to it a handful of parboiled oysters, a tail or two of lob- 
sters, the yolks of three or four eggs boiled hard, six ancho- 
vies, a good handful of sweet herbs chopped small, a little 
salt, chives, mace, nutmeg, pepper, and grated bread. Work 
all these together in a mortar with yolks of eggs, and lay it 
all over the fleshy part, with a little more pepper and salt all 
over the salmon. Then roll it up into a collar, and bind it 
with broad tape. Boil it in water, salt, and vinegar ; but let 
the liquor boil first. Then put in the; collars, with a bunch of 
sweet herbs, sliced ginger, and nutmeg. Let them boil 
gently nearly two hours; and when enough, take them up. 
Put tlu-m into the sousing-pan; and as soon as the pickle i* 



POTTING. 21-3 

cold, put it to the salmon, and let it stand in it till wanted for 
Use ; or it maybe potted after it is boiled, and fill it up with 
clarified butter; and this way it will keep good the longer. 

Mackerel. 

HAVING gutied the mackerel, slit it down the belly, cut off 
the head, and take out the bones; but take care not to cut it in 
holes. Then lay it flat upon its back, season it with pepper, 
salt, mace, and nutmeg, and a handful of parsley, shred fine. 
Strew it over them, roll them tight, and tie them well sepa- 
rately in cloths. Boil them gently twenty mimites in vinegar, 
salt, and water ; then take them out, put them into a pot, and 
pour the liquor on them. The next day take the cloth off 
the fish, put a little more vinegar to the pickle, and keep them 
for use. 



CHAPTER III. 
POTTING. 

PRELIMINARY HINTS AND OBSERVATIONS. 

JDEFORE you send your meat to the oven, take care to cover 
it well with butter, fasten it down with strong paper, and 
bake it well. As soon as it comes from the oven, drain the 
gravy |rom the meat, and be careful to pick out all the skins, 
as otherwise they will hurt the look of the meat, and the gravy 
will soon turn it sour. Remember always to beat your season- 
ing well before you put in your meat, and put it in by de- 
grees as you beat. When you put your meat into your pots, 
press it well, and be sure never to pour your clarified butter 
over your meat till it is quite cold. 

Marble Veal. 

BOIL, skin, and cut a dried tongue as thin as possible, and 
beat it very well with near a pound of butter, and a little 
beaten mace, till it be like a paste. Have ready some veal 
stewed and beat in the same manner. Then put some veal 
into some potting-pots, thin some tongue in lumps over the 
vea! ; but do not lay on the tongue in any form but in lumps, 
and it will then cut like marble. Fill the pot ( closeup with 
veal; press it very hard down, and pour clarified butter over

it. Remember to keep it in a dry place ; and when sent to 
table, cut it out in slices. 

Geese and Turkeys. 

TAKE a fat goose and a fat turkey, cut them down the 
rump, and take out all the bones. Lay them flat open, and 
season them with white pepper, salt, and nutmeg, allowing 
a nutmeg, with the Jike proportion of pepper, and as much 
salt as both the spices. When seasoned al^over, let the tur- 
key be within the goose, and keep them in seasoning two 
nights and a day ; then roll them up as collared beef, very 
tight, and as short as possible, and bind it very fast with 
strong tape. Bake it in a long pan, with plenty of butter, 
till very tender. Let it lie in the hot liquor an hour; then 
take it out, and let it stand till next day ; then unbind it, place 
it in the pot, and pour melted butter over it. Keep it for 
use, and slice it out thin. 

Tongues. 

RUB a neat's tongue with an ounce of saltpetre, and four 
ounces of brown sugar, and let it lie two days ; then boil it 
till quite tender, and take off she skin and side bits. Cut the 
tongue in very thin slices, and beat it in a marble mortar, with 
a pound of clarified butter, and season it to the taste with 
pepper, salt, and mace. Beat all as fine as possible, then put 
it close down into small potting-pots, and pour over them cla- 
rified butter. 

Or, take a dried tongue, boil it till tender, and then peel it. 
Take a goose and a large fowl, and bone them ; take a quar- 
ter ot an ounce of mace, the same quantity of olives, a large 
nutmeg, a quarter of an ounce of black pepper, and beat all 
well together ; add a spoonful of salt, and rub the tongue and 
the inside of the fowl well with them. Put the tongue into 
the fowl, then season the goose, and fill it with the fowl and 
tongue, and the goose will look as if it were whole. Lay it 
in a pan that will just hold it, melt fresh butter enough to 
cover it, send it to the oven, and bake it an hour and a naif; 
then uncover the pet, and take out the meat. Carefully drain 
it from the butter, lay it on a coarse cloth till cold, then take 

ff the hard fat from the gravy, and lay it before the fire to 
melt. Put the meat again into the pot, and pour the butter 
over it. If there is not enough, clarify more, and let the but- 
ter be an inch above the meat. It will keep a great while, 
n;ie, and look beautiful ; but must be cut crossways quite 
Observe, in potting it, to save a little of the spice to 
throw over it before the last butter is put on, otherwise the 
meat will not be sufficiently seasoned

Beef. 

TAKE half a pound of brown sugar, and an ounce of salt- 
petre, and rub it into twelve pounds of beef. Let it lie 
twenty-four hours; then wash it clean, and dry it well with 
a cloth. Season it to the taste, with pepper, salt, and mace, 
and cut it into five or six pieces. Put it into an earthen pot, 
with a pound of butter in lumps upon it, set it in a hot oven, 
and let stand there three hours. Then take it out, cut olTthe 
hard outsides, and beat it in a mortar. Add to it a little more 
pepper, salt, and mace. Then oil a pound of butter in the 
gravy and fat that came from the beef, and put it in as re- 
quired ; but beat the meat exceedingly fine. Then put it into 
the pots, press it close down, pour clarified butter over it, and 
keep it in a dry place. 

Or, take a buttock of beef, and cut the lean of it into pound 
pieces. To eight pounds of beef, take four ounces of salt- 
petre, the same quantity of petre-salt, a pint of white salt, 
and an ounce of sal-prunella. Beat all the salts very fine, 
mix them well together, and rub them into the beef. Then 
let it lie four clays, turning it twice a day. After that, put it 
into a pan, cover it with pump-water, and a little of its own 
brine. Bake it in an oven, with the household bread, till it - 
is tender ; drain it from the gravy ; and take out all the skin 
and sinews. Pound it into a marble mortar, lay it in a broad 
dish, and mix in it a quarter of an ounce of cloves and mace, 
three quarters of an ounce of pepper, and a nutmeg, all 
beat very fine. Mix all well with the meat, adding a little 
clarified fresh butter to moisten ir. Mix all again well toge- 
ther, press it down into pots very hard, set it at the mouth of 
the oven just to settle, and cover it two inches thick with cla- 
rified butter. Cover it with white paper as soon as it isco'id. 

Or, take two pounds of lean beef, cut it into slices, and lay 
them upon a plate; season with salt and pepper, and a little 
cochineal. Turn and season them on the other side, and then 
let them lie one upon another all night : put them into a pan ; 
add to them half a pint of small beer, a little vinegar, and as 
much water as will cover them, and some black and Jamaica, 
pepper : cover very close, and bake them. When they are 
baked, take the slices out of the pickle, while they are hot, 
let them lie till cold, and then beat them in a mortar. Add to 
them a pdund of fresh butter, while they are beating, some 
salt, pepper, and nutmeg. When they are well beaten, put 
them into the pot, and when the bread is drawn, put it into the 
oven until it is hot through. When cold, cover it over with 
clarified butter, and it win !;ee;> a mnnth or two. 



246 POTTING. 



To Pot Cold Beef. 

CUT it small, add to it some melted butter, two anchovies, 
boned and washed, and a little Jamaica pepper beat fine. 
Put them into a marble mortar, and beat them well together 
till the meat is yellow. Then put it into pots, and cover with 
clarified butter. 

Small Birds. 

HAVING picked and gutted the birds, dry them well with a 
cloth, and season them with pepper, salt, and mace. Then 
put them into a pot with butter,, tie the pot down with caper, 
and bake them in a moderate oven. When they come out, 
drain the gravy from them, and put them into potting-pots. 
Pour clarih'ed butter over them, and cover them close. 

Pigeons. 

PICK and draw the pigeons, cut off the pinions, wash them 
clean, and put them into a sieve to drain : dry them with a 
cloth, and season with pepper and salt. Roll a lump of but- 
ter in chopped parsley, and put it into the pigeons. Sew up 
the vent, put them into a pot with butter over them, tie them 
down, and set them in a moderately heated oven. When 
they come out, put them into potting-pots, and pour clarified 
butter over then). 

Woodcocks. 

TAKE six woodcocks, pluck them, and draw out the trail. 
Skewer their bills through their thighs, put their legs through 
each other, and their feet upon their breasts : season with 
three or four blades of mace, and a little pepper and salt. 
Put them into a deep pot, with a pound of butter over them ; 
bake them in a moderate oven, and when enough, lay them 
on a dish to drain the gravy from them. Then put them 
into potting-pots; take all the clear butter from the gravy, and 
put it upon them. Fill up the pots with clarified butter. 
Keep them in a dry place for use. 

Moor Game. 

HAVING picked and drawn the game, wipe them clean with 
a cloth, and season well with pepper, salt, and mace. Put 
one leg through the other, and roast them till of a good 
brown. When cold, put them into potting-pots, and pour 



POTTING. 247 

over them clarified butter ; but observe to keep their heads 
uncovered with butter. Keep them in a dry place. 

Venison. 

RUB the venison with vinegar, if stale, and let it lie an hour; 
dry it with a cloth, and rub it all over with red wine ; season 
with pepper, salt, and beaten mace, and put it on an earthen 
dish : pour over it half a pint of red wine, and a pound of 
butter, and set in the oven. If a shoulder, put a coarse paste 
over it, and bake it all night in a brown bread oven. When, 
it comes out, pick it clean from the bones, and beat it in a 
marble mortar, with the fat from the gravy. If not suffi- 
ciently seasoned, add more seasoning and clarified butter, 
and keep beating it till it is a fine paste. Then press it hard 
down into the pots, and pour clarified butter over it. 

Hares. 

LET the hare hang up for four or five days with the skin 
on, then case it, and cut it up as for eating. Put it into a pot, 
and season it with pepper, salt, and mace. Put a pound of 
butter upon it, tie it down, and bake it in a bread oven. 
When it comes out, pick it clean from the bones, and pound 
it very fine in a mortar, with the fat from the gravy: put it 
close down into pots, and pour over it clarified butter. 

Herrings. 

CUT off the heads of the herrings, and put them into an 
earthen pot; lay them close, and between every layer of her- 
rings strew some salt, but not too much. Put in cloves, 
rnace, whole pepper, and a nutmeg cut in pieces. Fill up 
the pot with vinegar, water, and a quarter of a pint of white 
wine. Cover it with brown paper, tie it down, and bake it in 
an oven with brown bread. As soon as cold, put it into pot- 
ting-pots for use. 

Chars. 

AFTER having cleansed them, cut off the fins, tails, and 
heads, and lay them in rows in a long baking-pan, having 
first seasoned them with pepper, salt, and mace. When 
done, let them stand till cold, put them into potting-pots, and 
cover them with clarified butter. 

Eels. 

SKIN, cleanse, and wash clean a very large eel. Dry it 
in a cloth, and cut in pieces about four inches long. Season 



243 POTTING. 

with a little beaten mace and nutmeg, pepper, salt, and a 
little sal-prunella beat fine. Lay in a pan, and pour as much 
clarified butter over as will cover it. Bake half an hour in a 
quick oven; but the size of the eel will determine the tim 
in baking. Take it out with a fork, and Jay it on a coarse 
cloth to drain. When quite cold, season again with the same 
seasoning, and lay them close in the pot. Then take off the 
butter it was baked in clear from the gravy of the fish, arid set 
it in a dish before the fire. When melted, pour the butter 
over it, and put by for use. The eels may be boned ; but in 
that case put in no sal-prunella. 

. Lampreys. 

SKIN the lampreys, cleanse them with salt, and wipe them 
dry ; bear some black pepper, mace, and cloves, mix them 
with salt, and season the fish with it: lay them in a pan, and 
cover them with clarified butter; bake them an hour, season 
well, and treat them in the same manner as above directed 
for eels. If your butter is good they will keep a long time. 

Smelts. 

DKAW out the inskJe ; season with salt, pounded mace, and 
pepper, and butter on the top; bake them, and when nearly 
cold, take them out, and lay them on a cloth. Put them into 
pots, take off the butter from the gravy, clarify it with more y 
and pour it on them. 

Pike. 

SCALE the. pike, cut off its head, split it, and take out iljp 
chine bone; strew all over the inside some bay-salt and pep- 
per; roll it up round, and lay it in a pot,~~cover it, and bake 
it an hour : then take it out, and lay it on a coarse cloth to 
drain, and when cold, put it into the pot, and cover with cla- 
rified butter. 

Lobster. 

BOIL a live lobster in salt and water, and stick a skewer in 
the vent of it to prevent the water (retting in. As soon as 
cold, take out the gut, take out all the flesh, beat it fine in 
a mortar, and season with beaten mace, grated nutmeg, pep- 
per and salt : mix all together, melt a piece.,0/ gutter the size 
of a walnut, und mix it with the lobster fP&lst beating it. 
When beaten to a paste, put it into the pottfiio-pot, as close 
and as hard as possible. Set some butler in a deep broad pan 
before the fire, and when all melted, take off the scum at the 
top, if any, and pour the clear butter over the meat as thick 



POTTING. 249 

as a crown -piece. The whey and churn-milk will settle at the 
bottom of the pan ; but take great care that none of that goes 
in, and always let the butter be very good. 

Shrimps. 

WHEN they are boiled, and shelled ; season well with pep- 
per, salt, and a little pounded cloves: put them close into a 
pot, set them for a few minutes into a slack oven, and pour 
over them clarified butter. 

Salmon. 

SCALE a piece of fresh salmon, and wipe it clean, season 
with Jamaica pepper, black pepper, mace, and cloves beat 
fine, mixed with salt, and a little sal-prunella; then pour cla- 
rified butter over it and bake it well: take it out carefully 
and lay it to drain. When cold, season it again, and lay it 
close in the pot, covered with clarified butter. 

Or, scale and clean the salmon, cut it down the back, dry 
it well, and cut it as near the shape of the pot as possible : 
take two nutmegs, an ounce of mace and cloves beaten, half 
an ounce of white pepper, and an ounce of salt ; take out all 
the bones, cut off the jowl below the fins and cut off the tail. 
Season the scaly side first, lay that at the bottom of the pot, 
then rub the seasoning on the other side, cover it with a dish, 
and let it stand ail night. It must be put double, and the 
scaly side top and bottom ; put some butter at the bottom and 
top, and cover the pot with some stiff coarse paste. If a large 
fish it will require three hours baking ; but if a small one, two 
hours will do it. When it comes out of the oven, let it stand 
h 9 an hour ; then uncover it, and raise it up at one end, 
that the gravy may run out, remembering to put u trencher 
and a weight on it to press out the gravy. When the butter is 
cold, take it out clear from the gravy, add more butter to it, 
and put it in a pan before the fire. When melted, pour it 
over the salmon, and as soon as it is cold, paper it up. 

Carp, Tench, and Trout, 
MAY be potted in manner already directed for salmon.

CHAPTER IV. 



SALTING AND SOUSING. 

THE PREPARATION OF BACON, HAMS, Ifc. 

Bacon. 

CUT off the hams and head of the pig, and, if a large one, 
take out the chine, but leave in the spareribs, as they will keep 
in the gravy, and prevent the bacon getting rusty. Salt it with 
common salt, and a little saltpetre, and let it lie ten days on 
a table, to let ^11 the brine run from it. Then salt it again ten 
or twelve days, turning it every day after the second salting : 
then scrape it very clean, rub a little salt on it, and hang it up. 
Take care to scrape the white froth off it very clean, and rub 
on a little dry salt, which will keep the bacon from rusting. 
The dry salt will candy and shine on it like diamonds. 

Or, take off all the inside fat of a side of pork, and lay it on 
a long board or dresser, that the blood may run from it. Rub 
it well on both sides with good salt, and let it lie a day. Then 
take a pint of bay-salt, a quarter of a pound of salt-petre, and 
beat them both fine ; two pounds of coarse sugar, and a 
quarter of a peck of common salt. Lay the pork in something 
that will hold the pickle, and rub it well with the above in- 
gredients. Lay the skinny side downwards, and baste it 
every day with pickle for a fortnight. Then hang it in a wood 
smoke, and afterwards hang it in a dry place but not in a hot 
place. Observe, that all hams and bacon should hang clear 
from every thing, and not touch the wall. Take care to wipe 
off the old salt before it is put into the pickle, and never keep 
bacon or hams in a hot kitchen, or in a room exposed to the 
rays of the sun, as all these matters contribute to make it 
rusty. 

Westphalia Bacon. 

HAVING chosen a fine side of pork, make the following 
pickle : take a gallon of pump-water, a quarter of a peck of 
bay-salt, the same quantity of white salt, a pound of petre- 
salt, a quarter of a pound of saltpetre, a pound of coarse 
sugar, and an ounce of socho tied up in a rag. Boil all these 



SALTING AND SOUSING. 251 

well together, and let it stand till cold. Then put in the pork, 
let it lie in this pickle for a fortnight, take it out, and dry it 
over sawdust smoke. This pickle will answer very well for 
tongues ; but in that case, the tongues must first lie six or 
eight hours in pump-water, to takeout the sliminess; and 
when they have lain a proper time in the pickle, dry them as 
pork. 

Hams. 

CUT out the hams from the pig, and rub them well with 
an ounce of saltpetre, half an ounce of sal-prunella pounded, 
and a pound of common salt. Observe, that these quantities 
of salts must be allowed to each ham. Lay them in salt-pans 
for ten days, turn them once in the time, and rub them well 
with more common salt. Let them lie ten days longer, and 
turn them every clay. Then take them out, scrape them as 
clean as possible, and dry them well with a clean cloth. Then 
rub them slightly over with a little salt, and hang them up to 
dry, but not in too hot a place. 

Or, take a fat hind-quarter of pork, and cut off a fine ham : 
take two ounces of saltpetre, a pound of coarse sugar, the 
same quantity of common salt, and two ounces of sal-prunella, 
mix ail together, and rub the pork well with it. Let it lie a 
month in this pickle, turning and basting it every day : then 
hang it in a wood smoke in a dry place, so that no heat can 
come to it ; and if intended to be kept long, hang them a 
month or two in a damp place, taking care that they do not 
become mouldy, and it will make them cut fine and short. 
Never lay these hams in water till they are boiled, and then 
boil them in a copper, or in the largest size pot. 

Hams the Yorkshire Way. 

FIRST beat them well, and then mix half a peck of salt, 
three ounces of saltpetre, half an ounce of sal-prunella, and 
five pounds of coarse salt. Rub the hams well wit!; this, and 
lay the remainder on the top. Let them lie three days, 
and then hang them up. Put as much water to the pickle as 
will cover the hams, adding salt till it will bear an egg, and 
then boil and strain it. Then next morning put in the hams, 
and press them down so that they maybe covered. Letthem 
lie a fortnight, rub them well with bran, and dry them. The 
above ingredients are sufficient for three middling sized 
hams. 

New England Hams. 

FOR two hams, take two ounces of sal-prunella ; beat it 
fine, rub it well in, and let them lie twenty-four hours. Then 



252 SALTING AND SOUSING. 

take half a pound of bay-salt, a quarter of a pound of brown 
salt, a quarter of a pound of common salt, and one ounce of 
saltpetre, all beat fine, and half a pound of the coarsest sugar. 
Rub all these well in, and let them lie two or three days. 
Then take common white sult,and make a pretty strong brine 
with about two gallons of water, and half a pound of brown 
sugar. Boil it well, arid skim it when cold. Then put in the 
hams, and turn them every two or three days in the pickle for 
three weeks. Then hang them up in a chimney, and smoke 
them well a day or two with horse -litter. Afterwards let them 
hang about a week on the side of the kitchen chimney, and 
then take them down. Keep them dry in a box, with bran 
covered over them. They may be eaten in a month, or will 
keep very well one year. 

Westphalia Ham. 

RUB it with half a pound of the coarsest sugar, and let it lie 
till night. Then rub it with an ounce of saltpetre finely 
beaten, and a pound of common salt. Let it lie three weeks, 
turning it every day. Dry it in wood smoke, or where turf 
is burnt. When boiled, put it into the pot or copper, with a 
pint of oak sawdust. 

To cure two Hams after the IV tstmor eland Manner. 

RUB the hams over night with ten ounces of saltpetre, and 
next morning take three pounds of common salt, three pounds 
of the coarsest sugar, and one pound of bay-salt. Boil all 
these in three quarts of strong beer; and when it has boiled 
a little time, pour it over the hams. Let theni lie in this 
pickle one month, rubbing and turning them every day, ob- 
serving not to take them out of the pan. The same pickle is 
good for tongues and sauces. Before they are smoked, rub a 
handful of bran over them to dry them, and let them hang 
three weeks or a month. 



Mutton Ha jus. 

CUT a hind-quarter of mutton like a ham, and rub it well 
with an ounce of saltpetre, a pound of coarse sugar, and a 
pound of common salt well mixed together. Lay it in a hol- 
low tray, with the skin downwards, and baste it every day 
for a fortnight. Then roll it in sawdust, and hang it in wood- 
smoke for a fortnight. Boil it, and hang it in a dry place. 
Cut it out in slices, and broil them as you want them, and they 
eat very fine. 



SALTING AND SOUSING. 253 



Veal Hams. 

TAKE a leg of veal, and cut it like a ham. Take a pint of 
bay-salt, two ounces of saltpetre, and a pound of common 
salt. Mix them all together, with an ounce of beaten juni- 
per berries, and rub the ham well with them. Lay it in a 
hollow tray, with the skinny side downwards, and baste it every 
day with the pickle for a fortnight, and then hang it in wood 
smoke for a fortnight longer. It may be either boiled, par- 
boiled, or roasted. 

Beef Hams. 

TAKE the leg of a fat Scotch or Welch ox, and cut it like 
a ham. Take an ounce of bay-salt, an ounce of saltpetre, a 
pound of common salt, and a pound of coarse sugar, which 
will be a sufficient quantity for about fourteen or fifteen 
pounds of beef ; and if a greater or less quantity of meat, mix 
the ingredients in proportion. Rub the meat with the above 
ingredients, turn it every day, and baste it well with the pickle 
every day for a month. Take it out, and roll it in bran or 
sawdust. Hang it in wood srnoke, where there is but little 
tire, and a constant smoke, for a month. Take it down, and 
hang it in a dry place, not a hot one, and keep it for use. Cut 
a piece off as there is occasion, and either boil it, or cut it into 
rashers, and broil it with poached eggs, or boil a piece, and it 
eats very good cold,. and v/ill shiver like Dutch beef. 

Tongues. 

HAVING scraped and dried the tongues clean with a cloth, 
salt them with common salt, and half an ounce of saltpetre 
to every tongue. Lay them in a deep pot, and turn them 
every day for a week or ten days. Salt them again, and let 
them lie a week longer. Then take them out, dry them with 
a cloth, flour them, and hang them up in a dry, but not in, a 
hot place. 

Hung Beef. 

MAKE a strong brine with bay-salt, saltpetre, and puinp- 
water, and put into it a rib of beef for nine days. Then hang 
it up in a chimney where wood or sawdust is burnt. When 
it is a little dry, wash the outside with blood two or three 
times, to make it look black; and when it is dried enough, 
boil it for use. 

Or, take the navel piece, and hang it up in your cellar as 
long as it will keep good, and till it begins to be a little 



254 SALTING AND SOUSING. 

sappy ; then take it down, and wash it in sugar and water, one 
piece after another, as it must be cut into three pieces Then 
take a pound of saltpetre, and two pounds of bay-salt dried 
and pounded small. Mix with them two or three spoonsful of 
brown sugar, and rub the beef well with it in every place. 
Then strew a sufficient quantity of common salt all over it, 
and let the beef lie close till the salt is dissolved, which will 
be in six or seven days. Turn it every other day for a fort- 
night, and after that hang it up in a warm, but not a hot 
place. It may hang a fortnight in the kitchen, and when it is 
wanted, boil it in bay-salt and pump-water till tender. It will 
keep when boiled, two or three months, rubbing it with a 
greasy cloth, or putting it two or three minutes into boiling 
water, to take off the mouldiness. 

Dutch Beef. 

TAKE a raw buttock of beef, cut off the fat, rub the lean 
all over with brown sugar, and let it lie two or three hours 
in a pan or tray, turning it two or three times. Then salt 
it with saltpetre and common salt, and let it lie a fortnight, 
turning it every day. Then roll it very straight in a coarse 
cloth, put it in a cheese-press a day and a night, and hang it 
to dry in a chimney. When it is boiled, put it in a cloth, 
and when cold, it will cut like Dutch beef. 

Pickled Pork. 

HAVING boned your pork, cut it into pieces of a size suit- 
able to lie in the pan into which it is intended to be put. 
Rub the pieces well with saltpetre; then take two pints'of 
common salt, and two of bay-salt, and rub the pieces well 
with them. Put a layer of common salt at the bottom of the 
vessel, cover every piece over with common salt, lay them 
upon one another as close as possible, rilling the hollow 
places on the sides with salt. As the salt melts on the top, 
strew on more, lay a coarse cloth over the vessel, a board over 
that, and a weight on the board to keep it down. Keep it 
close covered ; and thus managed, it will keep the whole 
year. 

Mock Brawn. 

TAKE the head and a piece of the belly part of a young 
porker, and rub it well with saltpetre. Let it lie three days, 
and then wash it clean. Split the head, and boil it ; take out 
the bones, and cut it in pieces. Then take four ox feet 
boiled tender, cut them in thin pieces, and lay them in the 



SALTING AND SOUSING. 255 

belly piece with the head cut small : roll it up tight with 
sheet tin, and boil it four or five hours. When it comes out, 
set it up on one end, put a trencher on it within the tin, press 
it down with a large weight, and let it stand all night. The 
next morning, take it out of the tin, and bind it with a fillet. 
Put it into cold salt and water, and it will be fit for use. It 
will keep a long time, if fresh salt and water are put to it every 
tour days. 

Sausages. 

TAKE six pounds of young pork, free from skin, gristles, 
and fat. Cut it very small, and beat it in a mortar till very 
fine. Then shred six pounds of beef suet very fine, and free 
from all skin. Take a good deal of sage, wash it very clean, 
pick off the leaves, and shred it very fine. Spread the meat 
on a clean dresser or table, and then shake the sage all over 
it, to the quantity of about three large spoonsful. Shred the 
thin rind of a middling lemon very fine, and throw it over the 
meat, and also as many sweet herbs as, when shred fine, will 
fill a large spoon. Grate over it two nutmegs, and put to it 
two tea-spoonsful of pepper, and a large spoonful of salt ; then. 
throw over it the suet, and mix all well together. Put it down 
close in a pot, and, when used roll it up with as much egg as 
will make it roll smooth. Make them of the size of a sau- 
sage, and fry them in butter or good dripping. Be sure that 
the butter in the pan is hot before they are put in, and keep 
rolling them about. When they are thoroughly hot, and are 
of a fine light brown, take them out and serve them up. 
Veal eats well done in this manner, or veal mixed with pork. 
Or, clean some guts, and fill them with this meat. 

Bologna Sausages. 

TAKE a pound of beef suet, a pound of pork, a pound of 
bacon, fat and lean together, and the same quantity of beef 
and veal. Cut them small and chop them fine. Take a small 
handful of sage, pick off the leaves, and chop them fine with 
a few sweet herbs. Season pretty high with pepper and salt. 
Take a large gut well cleaned, and fifi it. Set on a saucepan 
of water, and when it boils, put it in, having first pricked the 
gut to prevent its bursting. Boil it gently an hour, and then 
lay it on clean straw to dry.

CHOP fine a pound of beef marrow, half a pound of sweet 
almonds blanched, and beat them fine, with a little oraoge- 



256 SALTING AND SOUSING. 

flower or rose water, half a pound of white bread grated fine, 
half a pound of currants clean washed and picked, a quarter 
of a pound of fine sugar, a quarter of an ounce of mace, nut- 
meg, and cinnamon together, of each an equal quantity, and 
half a pint of sack. Mix all well together with half a pint of 
good cream, and the yolks of four eggs. Fill the guts half 
full, tie them up, and boil them a quarter of an hour. Or 
leave out the currants for change ; but then a quarter of a 
pound more sugar must be added. 

Hog's Pudding with Cuwants. 

To four pounds of beef suet finely shred, put three pounds 
of grated bread, and two pounds of currants clean picked and 
washed ; cloves, mace, and cinnamon, of each a quarter of 
an ounce finely beaten, a little salt, a pound and a half of 
sugar, a pint of sack, a quart of cream, a little rose water, 
and twenty eggs well beaten, leaving out half the whites. 
Mix all these well together, fill the guts half full, boil them a 
little, and prick them as they boil, to keep them from break- 
ing the guts. Take them up upon clean c!oths, and then lay 
them on the dish. 

Black Puddings. 

TAKE a peck of grits, boil them half an hour in water, 
drain them, and put them into a clean tub or large pan. Then 
kill the hog, and save two quarts of the blood, and keep stir- 
ring it till the blood is quite cold: mix it with the grits, and 
stir them well together. Season it with a large spoonful of 
salt, a quarter of an ounce of cloves, mace, and nutmeg 
together, an equal quantity of each. Dry it, beat it well and 
mix it. Take a little winter savoury, sweet marjoram, and 
thyme; chopped very fine. Of these take just a sufficient 
quantity to season them, and to give them a flavour, but no 
more. The next day take the leaf of the hog, and cut it into 
dice ; scrape and wash the guts very clean ; then tie one end, 
and begin to fill them. Mix in the fat whilst filling them, 
and be sure to put in a good deal of fat. Fill the skins three 
parts full, tie the other end, and make the puddings what- 
ever length may be required. Prick them with a pin, and 
put them into a kettle of boiling water. Boil them very sof th- 
an hour, take them out, and lay them on clean straw. 

Scotch Black Puddings. 

TAKE blood of a goose, chop off the head, and save the 
blood : stir it well till cold, and then mix it with grits, spice,

salt, and sweet herbs, according to their fancy, and some 
beef suet chopped. Take the skin off the the neck, then pull 
out the windpipe and fat, fill the skin, tie it at both ends, and 
make a pie of the giblets, laying the pudding in the middle. 

Turkey soused in Imitation of Sturgeon. 

DRESS a fine large turkey very clean, dry and bone it, then 
tie it up like a sturgeon, and put it into the pot with a quart 
of white wine, a quart of water, the same quantity of good 
vinegar, and a very large handful of salt ; but remember that 
the wine, water, and vinegar, must boil before the turkey is 
put in, and that the pot is well skimmed before it boils. 
When enough, take it out, and tie it tighter ; but let the liquor 
boil a little longer. If the pickle want more vinegar or salt, 
add it when cold, and pour it upon the turkey. It will keep 
some months, if covered close from the air, and kept in a cool 
dry place. It may be eaten with oil, vinegar, and sugar; and 
some admire it more than sturgeon. 

Soused Tripe. 

BOIL the tripe, and put it into salt and water, which must 
be changed every day till the tripe is used. When wanted, 
dip it in batter made of flour and eggs, and fry it of a good 
brown ; or boil it in fresh salt and water, with an onion sliced, 
and a few sprigs of parsley. Send it up to table, with melted 
butter in a boat. 

Pigs Feet and Ears soused. 

HAVING cleansed them properly, boil them till they are 
N tender, and then split the feet, and put them and the ears into 
salt and water. When used, dry them well with a cloth, dip 
them in batter, fry them, and send them up to table, as above 
directed for tripe. They will keep some time, and may be 
eaten cold ; but take care to make fresh pickle every other 
day.

Admiral Sir Charles Knowles's Receipt to salt Meat, 

As soon as the ox is killed, let it be skinned and cut up 
into pieces fit for use, as quick as possible, and salted whilst 
the meat is hot ; for which purpose have a sufficient quantity 
of saltpetre and bay-salt pounded together and made hot in an 
oven, of each equal parts. With this sprinkle the meat at the 
rate of about two ounces to the pound. Then lay the pieces 
on shelving boards to drain for twenty-four hours. Turn 
them, and repeat the same operation, and let them lie for 



268 GARDEN STU1FS AND FUU1TS. 

twenty -four hours longer. By this time the salt will be all 
melted, and have penetrated the meat, and the pieces be 
drained off. Each piece must be then wiped dry with clean 
coarse cloths, and a sufficient quantity of common salt made 
hot likewise in an oven and mixed, when taken out, with about 
one third of brown sugar. The casks being ready, rub each 
piece well with this mixture, and pack them well down, allow- 
ing about half a pound of the salt and sugar to each pound of 
meat, and it will keep good several years, and eat very well. 
It is best to proportion the casks or barrels to the quantity 
consumed at a time, as the seldomer it is exposed to the air 
the better. The same process does for pork, only a larger 
quantity of salt, and less sugar; but the preservation of both 
depends equally upon the meat being hot when first salted. 



CHAPTER V. 
TO KEEP GARDEN STUFFS AND FRUITS. 

PRELIMINARY HINTS AND OBSERVATIONS. 

.As the art of preserving garden stuffs and fruits from being 
injured or spoiled by keeping, j s a matter of some conse- 
quence to the superintendant of the kitchen, it will be neces- 
sary to observe, that every species of the vegetable tribe must 
be kept in dry places, as damp places will not only cover 
them with mould, but also totally deprive them of their fine 
flavour. The same thing will hold good with respect to bot- 
tled fruit; but take care r while you endeavour to avoid put- 
ting them into damp places, you do not put them where they 
may get warm, as that will equally spoil them. When you 
boil any dried vegetables, be sure that you allow them plenty 
of water. 

To keep French Beans all the Year. 

O.vnU'R the beans on a very fine day, and take only those 
that are young and free from spots. Clean and dry them, 
put a layer of salt at the bottom of a large stone jar, and then 
a layer of beans ; then salt, and then beans, and so on till the 
jar is full. Cover them with salt, tie a coarse cloth over 
them, put a board on that, and a weight to keep out the air. 
Set them in a dry cellar; and when taken out, cover the rest 



GARDEN STAFFS AND FRUITS, 259> 

close again. Wash those taken out very clean and let" tlrem 
lie in soft water twenty-four hours, shifting the water fre- 
quently ; and when boiled, do not put any salt in the water, 

The Dutch Method of preserving French Beans. 

TAKE a thousand French beans, when in full season, cue 
them slanting, and as thin as possible ; then procure a stone 
jar sufficient to contain them; in which deposit alternately 
a layer of beans, and then of common table salt, observing 
that the proportion of salt must be, for every thousand or 
beans, about four pounds. When the jar is full, let it stand' 
to the following day, and then press them down well till the 
water overflows, and the harder they are pressed the better. 
Cover them with a cloth within the jar, tight down upon the 
beans, over which place a trencher the size of the inside of 
the jar, and then a heavy weight on the top. It will be proper 
now and then to take off the cloth and wash it clean, when it 
must be put on again, as before-mentioned. By these means 
the beans may be preserved for a considerable time. When, 
dressed, let the quantity chosen be steeped the night before 
in cold water. In the morning they must be well washed in 
two or three fresh waters, and put into boiling water, letting- 
them boil hard till they become tender, for which half an hour 
will be sufficient. Take them off the fire, and stew themwittv 
a little butter, when they will be fit for the table. 

To keep Grapes, 

WHEN the grapes are cut from the vine, take care to leave 
a. joint of the stalk to them, and hang them up in a dry room, 
at a proper distance from each other, that the bunches may 
hung separate and clear of each other ;. for the air must pass 
freely between them, or there will be danger of their growing 
mouldy and rotten. The Frontiniac grape is the best for thk 
purpose, which, if managed properly, will keep to the end. of 
January at least. 

To keep Green Peas till Christmas, 

BE sure to choose peas for this purpose that' are young ancfc 
fine; shell them, and throw them into boiling water with 
some salt in it : let them boil five or six minutes, and then 
throw them into a cullender to drain. Then lay a cloth four 
or five times double on a table, and spread them on it. Dry 
them well, and having bottles ready, fill them, and cover them 
with mutton fat fried. When a little cool, fill the necks almost 
to the top, cork them, tie a bladder over them, and set them 
S2 



260 GARDEN STUFFS AND FRUITS. 

in a cool place. When used, boil the water, put in a little 
salt, some sugar, and a piece of butter: when boiled enough, 
throw them into a sieve to drain, and put them into a sauce- 
pan, with a good piece of butter ; keep shaking it round all 
the time till the butter is melted; then turn them into a dish, 
and send them to table. 

To keep Gooseberries. 

BEAT an ounce of allum very fine, and put it into a large 
pan of boiling hard water. Pick the gooseberries, put a few 
in the bottom of a hak sieve, and hold them in the boiling 
water till they turn white. Then take out the sieve, and 
spread the gooseberries between two clean cloths. Put more 
gooseberries in the sieve, and then repeat it till all are done. 
Pijt the water into a glazed pot till next day ; then put the 
gooseberries into wide-mouthed bottles, pick out all the 
cracked and broken ones, pour the water clear out of the 

Eot, and fill up the bottles with it. Cork them loosely, and 
jt them stand for a fortnight. If they rise to the corks, draw 
them out, and let them stand for three or four days uncorked; 
Then cork them close, and they will keep several months. 

Or, pick large green gooseberries on a dry day, and, hav- 
ing taken care that the bottles are clean and clry, fill and 
cork them. Set them in a kettle of water up to the neck, 
let the water boil very slowly till the gooseberries, are cod- 
dled ; then take them out, and put in the rest of the bottles 
till all are done. Have ready some rosin melted in a pipkin, 
dip the neck of the bottles into it, which will keep all the air 
from getting in at the cork. Keep them in a cool, dry place, 
free from damps, and they will bake as red as a cherry. 

To dry Artichoke Bottoms. 

JUST before the artichokes come to their full growth, pluck 
them from the stalks, which will draw out all the strings from 
the bottoms. Then boil them till the leaves can be easily 
plucked off, then lay the bottoms on tins, and set them in a 
cool oven. Repeat this till they are dry, which may be known 
by holding them up against the light ; when, if they are dry 
enough, they will be transparent. Hang them up in a dry 
place, in paper bags. 

To keep Walnuts. 

PUT a layer of sea sand at the bottom of a large jar, and then 

i la;:er of walnuts ; then sand, then the nuts, and so on till the 

jar is lull ; but be sure they do not touch each other in any of 



GARDEN STUFFS AND FRUITS. 261 

the layers. When wanted for use, lay them in warm milk 
and water for an hour, shift the water as it cools, and rub 
them dry, and they will peel well and eat sweet. Lemons will 
keep thus covered better than any other way. 

To bottle Green Currants. 

CURRANTS should be gathered when the sun is hot upon 
them. Strip them from the stalks, and put them into glass bot- 
tles. Cork them close, set them in dry sand, and they will 
keep all the winter. 

To keep Mushrooms. 

TAKE large buttons, wash them in the same manner as for 
stewing, and lay them on sieves with the stalks upwards. 
Throw over them some salt, to fetch out the water. When 
properly drained, put them in a pot, and set them in a cool 
oven for an hour. Take them out carefully, and lay them to 
cool and drain. Boil the liquor that comes out of them with 
a blade or two of mace, and boil it half way. Put the mush- 
rooms into a clean jar well dried ; and when the liquor is cold, 
pour it into the jar, and cover the mushrooms with it. Then 
pour over them rendered suet, tie a bladder over the jar, and 
set them in a dry closet, where they will keep very well the 
greater part of the winter. When used, take them out of the 
liquor, pour over them boiling milk, and let them stand an 
hour : stew them in the milk a quarter of an hour, thicken 
them with flour, and a large quantity of butter ; but be care- 
ful not to oil it. Beat the yolks of two eggs in a little cream, 
and put it into the stew ; but do not let it boil after the eggs 
are added. Lay untoasted sippets round the inside of the 
dish, then serve them up, and they will eat nearly as good as 
when fresh gathered. If they do not taste strong enough, 
put in a little of the liquor. This is a very useful liquor, as 
it will give a strong flavour of fresh mushrooms to all made 
dishes. 

Or, scrape, peel, and take out the insides of large flaps. 
Boil them in their own liquor, with a little salt, lay them in 
tins, set them in a cool oven, and repeat it till they are dry. 
Then put them in clean jars, tie them down close, and keep 
them for use. 

Te bottle Cranberries. 

CRANBERRIES for this purpose must be gathered when the 
weather is quite dry, and put into dry clean bottles. Cork 
them up close, and put them in a dry place, where neither 
heats nor damps can get to them. 



2 62 GARDEN STUFFS AND FRUITS. 

To bottle Damsons. 

GATHER damsons on a dry day, before they are ripe, or 
rather when they have just turned their colour. Put them in 
wide-mouthed bottles, cork them up closely, and let them 
stand a fortnight ; then look them over, and if any of them 
are mouldy or spotted, take them out, and cork the rest close 
down. Set the bottles in sand, and they will keep good till 
spring. 

N. B. The method of preserving different kinds of fruits 
in sweets and jellies, will be found in the Third Part, under the 
.Chapter of PRESERVING. 

French Method of preserving Sorrel. 

HAVING washed sorrel clean, let it drain ; then melt a 
pound of butter (or less according to the quantity of sorrel 
meant to be preserved) in an earthen pot, and put the sorrel 
on to boil. - When it is done enough, empty it out quite hot 
into stone or earthen jars, the sides of which must be well 
rubbed with butter, and let it stand until next morning. Then 
melt some mutton or beef fat, to cover the top about an inch 
thick, to prevent the air from getting- to the sorrel, as the 
least particle of air would turn it mouldy. 

French Method of preserving Endive. 

THE endive must be first washed whole; then cut oif the 
root, and, having tied an handful of the leaves together, put 
them into an earthen pot to boil. When they have bubbled two 
or three times, take them out and cut them into slices : range 
them in pots with salt and water sufficient to cover them ; after 
which, tie them down tight with a bladder and a piece of lea- 
ther. If wished to be eaten alone, they must be boiled in 
plain spring water, to take the salt out. 



PART III. 
CONFECTIONARY IN GENERAL, 



CHAPTER I. 



The Preparation of Sugars. 

1 O prepare sugars properly is a material point in the bnsi 
ness of confectionary ; and as some rules are undoubtedly ne- 
cessary to be given in a work of this kind, we shall begin with 
the first process, that of clarifying sugar, which must be doue 
in this manner : 

Break the white of an egg into the preserving-pan, put in 
four quarts of water, and beat it up to a froth with a whisk 
Then put in twelve pounds of sugar, mix all together, set it 
over the fire, and when it boils, put in a little cold water. 
Proceed in this manner as many times as may be necessary 
till the scum appears thick on the top. Then remove it from 
the fire, and let it settle ; take off the scum, and pass it 
through a straining bag. If the sugar should not appear very 
fine, you must boil it again before you strain it, otherwise, in 
boiling to a height, it will rise over the pan. Having thus 
finished the first operation, proceed to clarify the sugar to 
either of the five following degrees : 

First Degree, called Smooth or Candy Sugar. 

HAVING clarified the sugar as above directed, put any quan- 
tity over the fire, and let it boil till it is smooth. This may 
be known by dipping the skimmer into the sugar, and then 
touching it between the fore finger and thumb, and imme- 
diately opening them, a small thread will be drawn between, 
which will immediately break, and remain as a drop on the 
thumb. This will be a sign of its being in some degree of 
smoothness. Then give it another boiling, and it will draw 
into a larger string, when it will have acquired the first de- 
gree above mentioned. 



264 SUGARS. 

Second Degree , called Blown Sugar. 

To obtain this degree, boil the sugar longer than in the 
former process, and then dip in the skimmer, shaking off 
the sugar into the pan. Then with the mouth blow strongly 
through the holes, and if certain bladders or bubbles blow 
through, it will be a proof of its having acquired the second 
degree. 

Third Degree, called Feathered Sugar. 

THIS degree is to be proved by dipping the skimmer when 
the sugar has boiled longer than in the former degree. First 
shake it over the pan, then give it a sudden flirt behind, and 
if it is enough, the sugar will fly off like feathers. 

Fourth Degree, catted Crackled Sugar. 

HAVING let the sugar boil longer than in the preceding 
degree, dip a stick into the sugar, and immediately put it into 
a pot or cold water. Draw off the sugar that hangs to the stick 
into the water, and if it becomes hara, and snaps in the water, 
it has acouirecl the proper degree ; but, if otherwise, boil it 
till it answers that trial. Take particular care that the water 
used for this purpose is very cold, otherwise it will lead into 
errors. 

Fifth Degree, Called Carmel Sugar. 

To obtain this degree, the sugar must boil longer than in 
either of the former operations : prove it by dipping in a stick, 
first into the sugar, and then into cold water ; but observe, 
when it comes to the carmel height, it, will, the moment it 
touches the cold water, snap like glass, which is the highest 
and last degree of boiled sugar. Take care that the fire is 
not very fierce when this is boiling, lest, flaming up the sides 
of the pan, it should cause the sugar to burn, which will dis- 
colour and spoil it. 

Little Devices in Sugar. 

STEEP gum-tragacanth in rose-water, and with some double 
refined sugar make it up into a paste : colour the paste with 
powders and jellies according to fancy, and then make them 
up into the requisite shape. Moulds may be made in any 
shape, and they will be pretty ornaments placed on the tops 
of iced cakes. In the middle of them put little pieces of 
paper, with some pretty smart sentences written on them, and 
they will afford much mirth to the younger part of a com- 
pany. 



TARTS AND P UFFS. 265 



Sugar of Roses in various Figures. 

CLIP off the white of rose-buds, and dry them in the sun. 
Having finely pounded an ounce of them, take a pound of 
loaf sugar. Wet the sugar in rose- water, and boil it to a candy 
height. Put in the powder of roses, and the juice of lemon. 
Mix all well together, put it on a pie-plate, and cut it into 
lozenges, or make it into any other figure, such as men, wo- 
men, or birds. Ornaments for the dessert, may be gilded or 
coloured. 



CHAPTER II. 

TARTS AND PUFFS. 

Different Sorts of Tarts. 



\ 



N the eighteenth chapter of the first part of this work we have 
given sufficient directions for making of puff paste for tarts, 
and also the method of making tarts as well as pies ; what we 
have therefore here to mention concerns only tarts and puffs 
of the smaller kind. If you make use of tin patties to bake 
in, butter them, and put a little crust all over them, otherwise 
you cannot take them out; but if you bake them in glass or 
china, youthen need use only an upper crust, as you will not 
then want to take them out when you send them to table. 
Lay fine sugar at the bottom, then your cherries, plumbs or 
whatever sort you may want to put in them, and put sugar at 
the top. Then put on your lid, and bake them in a slack 
oven. Mince-pies must be baked in tin-patties, because of 
taking them out, and puff paste is best for them. Apples and 
pears, intended to be put into tarts, must be pared, cut into 
quarters, and cored. Cut the quarters across again, set them 
on a saucepan with as much water as will barely cover them, 
and let them simmer on a slow fire just till the fruit be tender. 
Put a good piece of lemon peel into the water with the fruit, 
and then have your patties ready. Lay tine sugar at the 
bottom, then your fruit, and a little sugar at top. Pour over 
each tart a tea-spoonful of lemon juice, and three tea-spoons- 
ful of the liquor they were boiled in. Then put on your lid, 
and bake them in a slack oven. Apricot tarts may be made 
the same, excepting that you must not put in any lemon juice. 



266 TARTS AND PUFFS. 

When you make tarts of preserved fruits, lay in your fruit, 
and put a very thin crust at top. Let them be baked but a 
little while ; and if you would have them very nice, have a 
large patty, the size of your intended tart. Make your 
sugar- crust, roll it as thin as a halfpenny, then butter your 
patty and cover it. Shape your upper crust on a hollow thing 
made on purpose, the shape of your patty, and mark it with 
a marking-iron for that purpose, in what shape you please, 
that it may be hollow and open to show the fruit through, it. 
Then bake your crust in a very slack oven, that you may not 
discolour it, and have it crisp. When the crust is cold, very 
carefully take it t, and fill it with what fruit you please. 
Then lay on the lid, and your business will be done. 

Currants, Cherries, Gooseberries, and Apricot Tarts, 

CURRANTS and raspberries make an excellent tart, and do 
not require much baking. Cherries require but little baking. 
Gooseberries, to look red, must stand a good while in the 
oven. Apricots, if green, require more baking than when 
ripe. Preserved fruit, as damsons and bullace, require but 
little baking. Fruit that is preserved high, should not be 
baked at all ; but the crust should first be baked upon a tin of 
the size the tart is to be. Cut it with a marking-iron or not, 
and when cold take it off, and lay it on the fruit. 

Rhubarb Tarts. 

TAKE the stalks of the rhubarb that grows in the garden, 
peel it, and cut it into the size of a gooseberry, and make it 
as gooseberry tart. 

Raspberry Tart with Cream. 

HAVING rolled out some thin puff paste, lay it in a patty- 
pan ; lay in some raspberries, and strew over them some very 
fine sugar. Put on the lid, and bake it, cut it open, and put 
in half a pint of cream, the yolks of two or three eggs well 
beaten, and a little sugar. Let it stand till cold before it is 
sent to the oven. 

Almond Tarts. 

HAVING blanched some almonds, beat them very fine in a 
mortar, with a little white wine and some sugar (a pound of 
sugar to a poundof almonds) some grated bread, a little nut- 
meg, some cream, and the juice of spinach to colour the al- 
monds green. Bake it in a gentle oven ; and when it is done, 
thicken it with can<iie<1 orange or citron. 



TARTS AND PUFFS. 267 



Green Almond Tarts. 

TAKE some almonds off the tree before they begin to shell ; 
scrape off the down with a knife ; have ready a pan with some 
cold spring water, and put them into it as fast as they are done. 
Then put them into a skillet, with more spring water, over a 
very slow fire, till it just simmers. Change the water twice, 
and let them be in the last till they begin to be tender. Then 
take them out, and put them on a clean cloth, with another 
over them, and press them to make them quite dry. Then 
make a syrup with double refined sugar, put.them into it, and 
let them simmer a little. Do the same the next day, put them 
into a stone jar, and cover them very close, for, if the least 
air comes to them, they will turn black. The yellower they 
are before they are taken out of the water, the greener they 
will be after they are done. Put them into the sugar crust, 
put the lid down close, and let them be covered with syrup. 
Bake them in a moderate oven. 

Orange Tarts. 

TAKE a Seville orange, and grate a little of the outside rind 
off it ; squeeze the juice of it into a dish, throw the peels into 
water, and change it often for four days. Then set a sauce- 
pan of water on the fire, and when it boils, put in the oranges ; 
but mind to change the water twice to take out the bitterness. 
When they are tender, wipe them very well, and beat them in 
a mortar till they are fine. Then take their weight in double 
refined sugar, boil it into a syrup, and skim it very clean : 
put in the pulp, and boil it altogether till it is clear. Let it 
stand to be cold, then put it into the tarts, and squeeze in 
the juice. Sake them in a quick oven. Good tarts are made 
with conserve of oranges. 

Chocolate Tarts. 

RASP a quarter of a pound of chocolate, a stick of cinna- 
mon, add some fresh lemon peel grated, a little salt, and some 
sugar : take two spoonsful of fine flour, and the yolks of six 
eggs well beaten, and mixed with some milk. Put all these 
into a stewpan, and let them be a little over the fire : add a 
little lemon peel cut small, and let it stand to be cold. Beat' 
up the whites of eggs enough to cover it, and put it in puff 
paste. When it is baked, sift some sugar over it, and glaze it 
with a salamander. 

' 



268 TARTS AND PUFFS. 



Angelica Tarts. 

TAKE sonic golden pippins or nonpareils, pare and core 
them ; take the stalks of angelica, peel them, and cut them 
into small pieces; 'apples and angelica, of^each an equal quan- 
tity. Boil the apples in just water enough to cover them, 
with lemon peel and fine sugar. Do them very gently till 
they are a thin syrup, and then strain it off. Put it on the 
fire, with the angelica in it, and let it hoil ten minutes. Make 
a puff paste, lay it at the bottom of the tin, and then a layer 
of apples and a layer of angelica till it is full. Bake them, 
but first fill them up with syrup. 

Spinach Tarts. 

SCALD some spinach in some boiling water, and drain it 
very dry. Chop it, and stew it in some butter and cream, 
with a very little salt, some sugar, some bits of citron, and a 
very little orange-flower water. Put it in very fine puff 
paste. 

Petit Patties. 

MAKE a short crust, roU it thick, and make them as big as 
the bowl of a spoon, ana about an inch deep. Take a piece 
of veal big enough to fill the patty, and as much bacon and 
beef suet. Shred them all very fine, season them with pep- 
per and salt, and a little sweet herbs. Put them into a little 
stewpan, keep turning them about, with a few mushrooms 
chopped small, for eight or ten minutes. Then fill the patties, 
and cover them with crust. Colour them with the yolk of an 
egg, and bake them. Some fill them with oysters, for fish 
dishes, or the milts of the fish pounded, and 3tsoned with 
pepper and salt. 

Curd Puffs. 

PUT a little rennet into two quarts of milk, and when it is 
broken, put it into a coarse cloth to drain. Then rub the 
curd through a hair sieve, and put to it four ounces of butter, 
ten ounces of bread, half a nutmeg, a lemon peel grated, and 
a spoonful of wine. Sugar it to the taste, rub the cups with 
butter, and put them for little more than half an hour into 
the oven. 

Sugar Puffs. 

BEAT the whites of ten eggs till they rise to a high froth ' 
rhen put them in a marble mortar or wooden bowl, and add 



TARTS AND PUFFS. 26* 

as much double refined sugar as will make it thick ; the* rub 
it round the mortar for half an hour, put in a few carrawfay 
seeds, and take a sheet of wafers, and lay it on as broad as a 
sixpence, and as high as possible. Put them into a mode- 
rately heated oven for a quarter of an hour, and they will look 

as white as snow. 

\ 

Wafers. 

TAKE a spoonful of orange flower water, two spoonsful of 
flour, two of sugar, and the same of cream. Beat them well 
together for half an hour; then make the wafer-tongs hot, 
and pour a little of the batter in to cover the irons. Bake 
them on a stove fire, and as they are baking, roll them round 
a stick like a spiggot. When cold, they will be very crisp, 
and are very proper to be eaten with jellies, or with tea. 

Chocolate Puffs, 

HAVING beat and sifted half a pound of double-refined 
sugar, scrape into it an, ounce of chocolate very fine, and mix 
them together. Beat the white of an egg to a very high froth, 
and strew in the sugar and chocolate. Keep beating it till it is 
as stiff as a paste. Then sugar the paper, drop them on the 
size of a sixpence, and bake them in a very slow oven. 

, Almond Puffs. 

TAKE two ounces of sweet almonds, blanch them, and beat 
thein very fine with orange flower water. Beat the whites of 
three eggs to a very high froth, and then strew in a little 
sifted sugar. Mix the almonds with the sugar and eggs, and 
then add more sugar till it be as thick as a paste. Lay it in 
cakes, and bake it in a cool oven on paper, 

Lemon Puffs. 

TAKE a pound of double refined sugar, beat it and sift it 
through a fine sieve. Put it into a bowl, with the juice of 
two lemons, and beat them together. Then beat the white 
of an egg to a very high froth ; put it into the bowl, beat it

CHAPTER III. 
CAKES. 

PRELIMINARY HINTS AND OBSERVATIONS. 

KE you begin to make any cake, take care that all your 
ingredients are ready to your hand. Beat up your eggs 
well, and then do not leave them to go about any thing else 
till your cake is finished, as the eggs, by standing unrnixed r 
will require beating again, which will contribute to make the 
cake heavy. If butter is put into the cakes, be sure to beat 
it to a fine cream before sugar is added, otherwise it will re- 
quire double the beating, and after all will not answer the 
purpose so well. Cakes made with rice, seeds, or plurnbs, are 
best baked in wooden garths; for when baked either in pots 
or tins, the outside of the cakes will be burned, and will be- 
sides be so much confined, that the heat cannot penetrate 
into the middle of the cake, which will prevent it from rising. 
All kinds of cakes must be baked in a good oven, heated ac- 
cording to the size of the cake. 



A rich Cake. 

TAKE seven pounds of currants washed and rubbed, four 
pounds of flour dried and sifted, six pounds of the best fresh 
butter, and two pounds of Jordan almonds, blanched andbeaj- 
en with orange flower water till fine; four pounds of eggs, but 
leave out the whites ; three pounds of double-refined sugar 
beaten and sifted ; a quarter of an ounce of mace, the same 
of cloves and cinnamon, and three large nutmegs, all beaten 
fine ; a little ginger, half a pint of sack, half a pint of French 
brandy, and sweetmeats, such as orange, lemon, and citron, 
to the liking. Before mixing the ingredients, work the but- 
ter to a creum. Then add the sugar, and work them well 
together. Let the eggs be well beaten and strained through 
a sieve : work in the almonds, then put in the eggs, and beat 
them together till they look white and thick. Then put in 
the sack, brandy, and spices ; shake in the flour by degrees, 
and when the oven is ready, put in the currants and sweet- 
meats, as it is put into the hoop. Put it into a quick oven, 
and four hours will bake it. Remember to keep beating it 
with the hand whilst mixing it; and when the currants are 



CAKES. 271 

well washed and cleaned, let them be kept before the fire, that 
they may go warm into the cake. This quantity will bake 
best in two hoops, it being too large for one. 

Plum Cake. 

To a pound and a half of fine flour, well dried, put the same 
quantity of butter, three quartern of a pound of currants 
washed and well picked; stone and slice half a pound of rai- 
sins, eighteen ounces of sugar beat and sifted, and fourteen 
eggs, leaving out half the whites; shred the peel of a large 
lemon exceeding fine, three ounces of candied orange, the; 
same of lemon, a tea spoonful of beaten mace, half a nut- 
meg grated, a tea-cupful of brandy, or white wine, and four 
spoonsful of orange flower. First work the butter with the 
hand to a cream, then beat the sugar well in, whisk the eggs 
for half an hour, then mix them with the sugar and butter, and 
put in the flour and spices. The whole will take an hour and 
a half beating. When the oven is ready, mix in lightly the 
brandy, fruit, and sweetmeats, then put it into the hoop, and 
bake it two hours and a half. 

White Plum Cakes. 

TAKE two pounds of flour well dried, half that quantity of 
sugar beaten and sifted, a pound of butter, a quarter of an 
ounce of nutmegs, the same of mace, sixteen eggs, two 
pounds and a half of currants picked and washed, half a pound 
of sweet almonds, the same of candied lemon, half a pint of 
sack or brandy, and three spoonsful of orange flower water. 
Beat the butter to a cream, put in the sugar, beat the whites 
of the eggs half an hour, and mix them with the sugar and 
butter. Then beat the yolks half an hour, and mix them 
with the whites, which will take two hours beating. Put in 
the flour a little before the oven is ready, and just before put- 
ting it into the hoop, mix together lightly the currants, and 
other ingredients. It will take two hours hours baking. 

A Pound Cake. 

BF.AT a pound of butter in an earthen pan with the hand 
one way till like a fine thick cream. Then have ready twelve 
eggs; but leave out half the whites; beat them well; then 
beat them up with the butter, a pound of flour beat in it, a 
pound of sugar, and a few carravvays. Beat all well together 
with the hand for an hour, or beat it with a wooden spoon- 
Put all into a buttered pan, and bake it in a qnick oven for 
one hour.

softly a spoonful of double refined-sugar, sifted fine ; lay a wet 
sheet of paper on a tin, and with a spoon drop the froth in 
little lumps on it, at the same distance from each other. Sift 
a good quantity of sugar, over them, set them in an oven after 
brown bread, then n.ake' the oven close up, and the froth will 
rise. They will be baked enough as soon as they are co- 
loured. Then take them but, and put two bottoms together ; 
lay them on a sieve, and set them to dry in a cool oven. Or, 
before closing the bottoms together to dry, lay raspberry jam, 
or any kind of sweetmeats, between them. 

Macaroons.

CHAPTER IV. 

CUSTARDS AND CHEESECAKES, 

PRELIMINARY HINTS AND OBSERVATIONS. 

1 HE greatest care must be taken in the making of custards, 
that your tossing-pan is well tinned ; and always remember to 
put a spoonful of water into your pan, to prevent your ingre- 
dients sticking to the bottom of it ; and what we have here said 
of custards, must be attended to in the making of creams, of 
which we shall treat in the next chapter. Cheesecakes must 
not be made long before they are put into the oven, particu- 
larly almond or lemon cheesecakes, as standing long will make 
them grow oily, and give them a disagreeable appearance. 
They should always be baked in ovens of a moderate heat ; 
for if the oven be too hot, it will burn them, and spoil their 
beauty, and too slack an oven will make them look black and 
heavy. This is a matter, however, for which no precise rules 
can be given, and can be learned only by cautious practice and 
the nicest observations. 

Baked Custards. 

BOIL a pint of cream with some mace and cinnamon, and 
when it is cold, take four yolks and two whites of eggs, a 
little jree and orange flovrer-water and sack, arid nutmeg and 
sugaj.to the palate. Mix them well together, and bake them 
in cups. 



CUSTARDS AND CHEESECAKES. 281 



Almond Custards. 

BLANCH and beat a quarter of a pound of almonds very 
fine, take a pint of cream, and two spoonsful of rose water. 
Then sweeten it to the palate, and beat up the yolks of four 
eggs. Stir all together one way over the fire till it is thick, 
and then pour it into cups. 

Plain Custards. 

SET a quart of good cream over a slow fire, with a little 
cinnamon, and four ounces of sugar. When it has boiled, 
take it off the fire, beat the yolks of eight eggs, and put to 
them a spoonful of orange-flower water, to prevent the cream 
from cracking. Stir them in by degrees as the cream cools, 
put the pan over a very slow fire, stir it carefully one way till 
it is almost boiling, and then pour it into cups. 

Or, take a quart of new milk, sweeten it to the taste, beat 
up well the yolks of eight eggs, End the whites of four. Stir 
them into the milk, and bake it in custard cups. Or, put them 
in a deep china dish, and pour boiling water round them, till 
the water is better than half way up their sides ; but take 
care the water does not boil too fast, lest it should get into the 
cups, and spoil the custards. 

Orange Custards. 

HAVING boiled very tender the rind of half a Seville 
orange, beat it in a mortar, till it is very fine, put to it a 
spoonful of the best brandy, the juice of a Seville orange, 
four ounces of loaf sugar, and the yolks of four eggs. Beat 
them all well together for ten minutes, and then pour in by 
degrees a pint of boiling cream. Keep beating them till cold, 
then put them in custard cups, and set them in an earthen dish 
of hot water. Let them stand till they are set, then take 
them out, and stick preserved orange on the top. They may 
be served up either hot or cold. 

Lemon Custards. 

TAKE half a pound of double-refined sugar, the juice of 
two lemons, the out-rind of one pared very thin, the inher- 
rind of one boiled tender and rubbed through a sieve, and a 
pint of white wine. Let them boil a good while, take out the 
peel and a little of the liquor and set it to cool : pour the rest 
into the dish intended for it, beat the yolks and two whites of 
eggs, and mix them with the cold liquor. Strain them into 
the dish, stir them well up together, and set them on a slow 



282 CUSTARDS AND CHEESKCAKfiS. 

fire in boiling water. When it is enough, grate the rind of a 
lemon all over the tcp, or brown it over with a hot salaman- 
der. This, like the former, may be eaten either hot or cold. 

Beest Custards. 

SET a pint of beest (milk taken from the cow within three 
days of her calving) over the fire, with a little cinnamon, or 
three bay leaves, and let it be boiling hot : take it off, and 
have ready mixed a spoonful of flour, and the same of thick 
cream. Pour the hot beest upon it by degrees, mix it ex- 
ceedingly well together, and sweeten it to the taste. You 
may bake it .in either crusts or cups. 

Cheesecakes. 

PUT a spoonful of rennet into a quart of new milk, and set 
it near the fire; let the milk be blood warm, and when it is 
broken, drain the curd through a coarse sieve. Now and 
then break the curd gently with the fingers, and rub into it 
a quarter of a pound of butter, the same quantity of sugar, a 
nutmeg, and t-vo Naples biscuits grated , the ^olksoi four 
eggs and the white of one, and an ounce ot' almonds well 
beaten, with two spoonsful of rose wa^er, and the same of 
sack. Clean six ounces of currants weii, and put nem into 
the curd. Mix all well together, and send it to the oven. 

Citron Cheesecakes. 

BEAT the yolks of four eggs, and mix them with a quart of 
boiled cream. When it is coid, set it on the fire, and let it

A Tnjle. 

COVER the bottom of a trifle dish with Naples biscuits 
broken into pieces, mactiroons broken in half, an I ratifi* 
cakes ; just wet them all through \\ ith white wine, and make 
a good boiled custard, not too thick, and when cold, put it 
over it, and then a syllabub over that : garnish with ratifia 
cakes, currant jelly, and coloured comfits.

moisten them ; take a quart of cream, and put in as much 
sugar as will sweeten it ; but first rub the sugar over the rind 
of a lemon to get out the essence : put the cream into a pot, 
mill it to a strong froth, and lay as much froth upon a sieve 
as will fill the trifle dish; put the remainder of the cream into

CREAMS AND JAMS. 287 



Lemon Cream. 

TAKE the rinds of two lemons pared very thin, the juice of 
three, and a pint of spring water ; beat the whites of six eggs 
very fine, and mix them with the water and lemon. Then

eggs, and put it over the fire to thicken ; then pour it into a 
bowl, and put into glasses as soon as it is cold. 

Orange Cream. 

PARE off the rind of a Seville orange very fine, and squeeze 
the juice of four oranges; put them into a tossing pan, with 
a pint of water, and eight ounces of sugar ; beat the whites 
of five eggs, and mix all, and set them over the fire : stir it 
one way till it grows thick and white, then strain it through a 
gauze, and stir it till it is cold. Beat the yolks of five eggs 
exceedingly fine, and put it into the pan, with some cream ; 
stir it over a very slow fire till it is ready to boil, then put it 
into a bason to cool, and having stirred it till it is quite cold, 
put it into glasses. 

Raspberry Cream. 

RUB a quart of raspberries, or raspberry jam, through a hair 
sieve, to take out the seeds, and mix it well with cream. Put 
in sugar to the taste, and then put it into a milk-pot to raise a 
froth with a chocolate mill. As the froth rises, take it off with 
a spoon, and lay it upon a hair sieve. When there is as 
much froth as is wanted, put what cream remains into a deep 
china dish, pour the frothed cream upon it as high as it will lie 
on, and stick a light flower in the middle of it. 

Chocolate Cream. 

TAKE a quarter of a pound of the best chocolate, and 
having scraped it fine, put to it as much water as will dissolve 
it ; then beat it half an hour in a mortar, and put in as much

a little in the cream. Whip it up with a whisk, and some 
lemon peel tied in the middle of the whisk ; take the froth 
with a spoon, and lay it in glasses. This makes a pretty ap- 
pearance over fine tarts. 

Pompadour Cream. 

TAKE the whites of five eggs, and beat them to a strong 
froth ; put them into a tossing pan, with two spoonsful of 
orange-flower water, and two ounces of sugar ; stir it gently 
for three or four minutes, then pour it into a dish, and pour 
good melted butter over it. This is a pretty corner dish for a 
second course at dinner, and must be served up hot. 

Snow and Cream. 

HAVING made a rich boiled custard, put it into a china or 
glass dish ; then take the whites of eight eggs beaten with 
rose water and a spoonful of treble-refined sugar, till it is of 
a strong froth : put some milk and water into a broad stew- 
pan, and as soon as it boils, take the froth off the eggs, lay it 
on the milk and water, and let it boil once up. Then take 
it off carefully, and lay it on the custard. This is a pretty 
supper dish. 

Gooseberry Jam. 

CUT in two, and pick out the seeds of green walnut goose- 
berries, gathered when full grown, but not ripe ; put them 
into a pan of water, green them, and put them into a sieve to 
drain. Then beat them in a marble mortar, with their weight 
of sugar. Take a quart of gooseberries, boil them to a mash 
in a quart of water, squeeze them, and to every pint of liquor 
put a pound of fine loaf sugar. Then boil and skim it, put 
in the green gooseberries, and having boiled them till very 
thick, clear, and of a pretty green, put them into glasses. 

Apricot Jam. 

HAVING procured some of the ripest apricots, pare and cut 
them thin ; then infuse them in an earthen pan till tender and 
dry: to every pound 1 and a half of apricots, put a pound of 
double refined sugar, and three spoonsful of water. Boil 
the sugar to a candy height, and put it upon the apricots: stir 
them over a slow tire till they look clear and thick; but ob- 
serve, that they must only simmer, and not boil. Put them 
into glasses.

Strawberry Jam. 

BRUISE very fine some scarlet strawberries gathered when 
Very ripe, and put to them a little juice of strawberries ; 
beat and sift their weight in sugar, strew it among them, and 
put them into* the preserving pan : set them over a clear slow 
fire, skim and boil them twenty minutes, and then put them 
into glasses. 

While Raspberry Jam.

in their own weight of loaf sugar, and half their weight of 
red currant juice baked and strained as for jelly: set them 
over a clear slow fire, boil them half an hour, skim them well, 
and stir them all the time : then put them into pots or glasses 
as above directed. 

Black Currant Jam.

JELLIES AND SYLLABUBS. 

Blanc Mange. 

1 His jelly is made three different ways, the first of which 
is called green, and is thus prepared from isinglass : having 
dissolved the isinglass, put to it two ounces of sweet and the 
same quantity of bitter almonds, with a sufficient quantity of 
the juice of spinach to make it green, and a spoonful of French 
brandy : put it over a stove fire till almost ready to boil, 
then strain it through a gauze sieve, and when it grows 
thick, put it into a melon mould, and the next day turn it out. 

Or, take a quart of water, put into it an ounce of isinglass, 
and let it boil till reduced to a pint ; then put in the whites of 
four eggs, with two spoonsful of rice water to keep the eggs 
from poaching, and sugar it to the taste. Run it through a 
jelly bag, then put to it two ounces of sweet and one ounce 
of bitter almonds. Give them a scald in the jelly, and put 
them through a hair sieve. Then put it into a mould, and the 
next day turn it out, stick it all over with almonds blanched 
and cut lengthways. ^ 

Or, skim off the fat, and strain a quart of strong calf's feet 
jelly ; then beat the whites of four eggs, and put them to the 
jelly. Set it over the fire, and stir till it boils. Then pour it 
into a jelly bag, and run it through several times till it is 
clear. Beat an ounce of sweet and the same quantity of bit- 
ter almonds to a paste, with a spoonful of rose water squeezed 
through a cloth ; then mix it with a jelly, and add to it three 
spoonsful of very good cream. Set it again over the fire, and 
stir it till it is almost boiling. Then pour it into a bowl, stir 
it very often till it is almost cold, and then fill the moulds, 
having first wetted them. 

Orange Jelly. 

INTO two quarts of spring water put a pound of hartshorn 
shavings, and let it boil till it is reduced to a quart. Then 
pour it clear off, and let it stand till it is cold. Take the rind 
of three oranges, pared very thin, and the juice of six, and 
let them stand all night in half a pint of spring- water. Then 



JELLIES AND SYLLABUBS. 2i?i 

strain them through a fine hair sieve, melt the jelly, and pour 
the orange liquor to it. Sweeten it to the taste with double- 
refined sugar, and put to it a blade or two of mace, four or 
five cloves, half a small nutmeg, and the rind of a lemon. 
Beat the whites of five or six eggs to a froth, mix it well with 
the jelly, and set it over a clear fire. Boil it three or four 
minutes, then run it through a jelly bag several times till it is 
clear ; but take great care not to shake it when pouring it into 
the bag. 

Fruit in Jelly. 

TAKE a bason, put into it half a pint of clear stiff calf's 
feet jelly, and when it be set and stiff, lay in three fine ripe 
peaches, and a bunch of grapes with the stalk upwards. Put 
over them a few vine leaves, and then fill up your bowl with 
jelly. Let it stand till the next day, and then set your bason 
to the brim in hot water. As soon as you perceive it gives 
way from the bason, lay your dish over it, and turn your jelly 
carefully upon it. Yoii may use flowers for your garnish. 

. Calf's Feet Jelly. 

TAKE two calf's feet, and boil them in a gallon of water 
till it comes to a quart ; when cold, skim off all the fat, and 
take the jelly up clean ; leave what settling may remain at 
the bottom, and put the jelly into a saucepan, with a pint of 
mountain wine, half a pound of loaf sugar, and the juice of 
four lemons : beat up six or eight whites of eggs with a whisk, 
then put them into the saucepan, stir all well together till it 
boils, and let it boil a few minutes. Pour it into a large flannel 
bag, and repeat it till it runs clear. Have ready a large china 
bason, and put into it lemon peel cut as thin as possible; let 
the jelly run into the buson, and the lem^n peel will give it an 
amber colour and a fine flavour : then fill the glasses. 

A Turkey, Fowls, or Game, in Jelly. 

BOIL a fine turkey, and let it stand till cold ; have ready a 
jelly made thus : Skin a fowl, and take off all the fut ; but -do 
not cut it in pieces, nor break all the bones ; take four pounds 
of a leg of veal without either fat or skin, and put it into a 
well-tinned saucepan. Put to it full three quarts of water, 
and set it on a very clear fire till it begins to simmer ; but be 
sure to' skim it well, and take great care that it does not boil. 
Put to it two large blades of mace, half a nutmeg, and twenty 
corns of white pepper, with a little bit of lemon peel. Let it 
simmer six or seven hours, and when the jellv is stiff enough,

which may be known by taking a little out to cool, be sure t<7 
skim off all the fat, if any, but do not stir the meat in the 
saucepan. A quarter of an. hour before it is done, throw in a 
large tea spoonful of salt, and squeeze in the juice of half a 
fine Seville orange, or lemon. When enough, strain it off 
through a clean sieve ; but do not pour it off clean from the 
bottom, for fear of settlings ; lay the turkey in the dish, and 
then pour the jelly over it. Let it stand till quite cold, and 
then send it to table. All sorts of birds and fowls may be 
done in this manner, and are very pretty dishes for a supper 
or cold collation. 

Gilded Fish in Jelly. 

FILL two large fish moulds with clear blanc mange, made 
as before directed ; when cold, turn them out, and gild them, 
with leaf gold, or strew them over with gold and silver bran 
mixed. Then lay them on a soup dish, and fill it with thin 
clear calf's feet jelly, which must be so thin as to admit the 
fish to swim in it. Lisbon, ot any kind of pale made wine, 
will answer the purpose. 

Black Currant Jelly. 

GATHER the currants on a dry day, when they are ripe, 
strip them off the stalks, and put them into a large stewpot. 
Put a quart of water to every ten quarts of currants, tie a 
paper over them, and set them in a cool oven for two hours. 
Then squeeze them through a very fine cloth, and to every 
quart of juice add a pound and a half of loaf sugar broken into 
small pieces. Stir it gently till the sugar is melted, and when 
it boils, skim it well. Let it boil pretty quick for half an 
hour over a clear fire, then pour it into pots, and put brandy- 
papers over them. 

Red Currant Jelly. 

GATHER the currants, and strip them off the stalks, as be- 
tore directed. Put them into a large stewpot, tie paper over 
them, and let them stand an hour in a cool oven. Then 
strain them through a cloth, and to every quart of juice add 
a pound and a half of loaf sugar, broken into small lumps. 
Stir it gently over a clear fire till the sugar is melted, skim 
it well, and let it boil pretty quick for twenty minutes. Then 
pour it hot into pots ; for if suffered to cool, it will break the 
jelly, and will not set so well as when it is hot. Put brandy- 
papers over them, and keep them in a dry place. In the same 
manner, a pretty jelly may be made of half white and half 
red currants. 



JELLIES AND SYLLABUBS. 293 



Ribband Jelly. 

TAKE four calf's feet, take out the great bones, and put 
the feet into a pot with ten quarts of water, three ounces of 
hartshorn shavings, the same quantity of isinglass, a nutmeg- 
quartered, and four blades of mace : boil it till it comes to two 
quarts, then strain it through a flannel bag, and let it stand 
twenty-four *iours. Scrape off all the fat from the top very 
clean, slice the jelly, and put to it the whites of six eggs 
beaten to a froth. Boil it a little, and strain it through a 
flannel bag. Then run the jelly into little high glasses, and 
run every colour as thick as the finger; but observe, that one 
colour must be thoroughly cold before another is put on ; and 
that which is put on must be but blood -warm, otherwise they 
will mix together. Colour red with cochineal, green with 
spinach, yellow with saffron, blue with syrup of violets, white 
with thick cream, and sometimes the jelly by itself. 

Hen and Chickens in Jelly. 

HAVING made some flummery with plenty of sweet almonds 
in it, colour part of it brown with chocolate, and put it into a 
mould of the shape of a hen. Then colour some more flum- 
mery with t'-'e yo.k of a hard egg beat as fine as possible, 
and leave some of the flummery white. Then fill the moulds 
of seven chickens, three with white flummery, three with 
yellow, and one of tiie colour of the hen. When cold, turn 
them into a deep dish, and put round them lemon peel 
boiled tender, and cut like straw. Then put a little clear calf's 
feet jelly under them, to keep them to their places. Let it 
stand till it is stiff, and then fill up the dish with more jelly. 

Hartshorn Jelly. 

TAKE half a pound of hartshorn shavings, and boil in three 
quarts of water over a gentle fire till it becomes a jelly : if 
a little is taken out to cool, and it hangs on the spoon, it is 
enough. Strain it while hot, and put it in a well-tinned sauce- 
pan : put to it a pint of Rhenish wine, and a quarter of a 
pound of loaf sugar; beat the whites of four eggs or more to 
a froth, stir it all together, that the whites may mix well with 
the jelly, and pour it in as if for cooling it. Let it boil two or 
three minutes, then put in the juice of three or four lemons, 
and let it boil a minute or two longer. When finely curdled, 
and of a pure white colour, pour the jelly into a swan-skin 
jelly-bag over a bowl or a bason. Strain it in this mannejr 



594- JELLIES AND SYLLABUBS. 

several times till it is as clear as rock water, and then fill the 
glasses with a spoon. Have ready the thin ,rind of some 
lemons, and having half filled the glasses, throw the peel 
into the bason. When the jelly is all run out of the bag into 
the bason, fill the rest of the glasses with a clean spoon, and 
the lemon peel will give the jelly a fine amber colour. No 
rule is to be given for putting in the ingredients, as taste and 
fancy only can determine it ; but most people like to have 
them sweet, and indeed they are insipid if they are not so. 

Flummery. 

TAKE an ounce of bitter, and the same quantity of sweet 
almonds, put them into a bason, and pour over them some 
boiling water to make the skins come off; strip off the skins, 
and throw the kernels into cold water; take them out, and 
beat them in a marble mortar, with a little rose water to keep 
them from oiling, and when beaten, put them into a pint of 
calf 's feet stock. Set it over the fire, and sweeten it to the 
taste with loaf sugar. As soon as it boils, strain it through a 
piece of muslin or gauze, and when it is a little cold, put it 
into a pint of thick cream, and keep stirring it often till it 
grows thick and cold. Wet the moulds in cold water, and 
pour in the flummery. Let them stand about six hours be- 
fore turning them out ; and if the flummery is stiff, wet^the 
moulds, and it will turn out without putting them into warm 
water, which will be a great advantage to the look of the 
figures, as warm water gives a dulness to the flummery. 

French Flummery. 

BEAT half an ounce of isinglass fine, put to it a quart of 
cream, and mix them well together; let it boil softly over a 
slow fire for a quarter of an hour, and stir it all the time : take 
it off, sweeten it to the taste, and put in a spoonful of rose 
water, and another of orange-flower water. Strain it, and 
pour it into a glass or bason, and when cold, turn it out. 

Green Melon in Flummery. 

PUT plenty of bitter almonds into a little stiff flummery, 
and add to it as much juice of spinach as will make it of a 
fine pale green. When it becomes as thick as good cream, 
wet the melon mould, and put it in. " Then put a pint of clear 
calf's feet jelly into a large bason, and let them stand till the 
next day. Then turn out the melon, and lay it down in the 
middle of the bason of jelly. Then fill up the bason with 
jelly that is beginning to set, and let it stand all night. The 
next day, turn it out the same way as fruit in jelly.

part a pretty pink colour with a little cochineal bruised 
fine, and steep it in French brandy. Scrape an ounce of 
chocolate very fine, dissolve it in a little strong coffee, and 
mix it with another part of the flummery, to make it a light 
stone colour. The last part must be white. Then wet the 
temple mould, and fit it in a pot to stand even. Fill the top 
of the temple with red flummery for the steps', and the four 
points with white. Then fill it up with chocolate flummery, 
and let it stand till the next day. Then loosen it round with 
a pin, and shake it loose very gently ; but do not dip the 
mould in warm water, as that will take off the gloss, and 
spoil the colour. When it is turned out stick a small sprig 
of flowers, down from the top of every point, which will not 
only strengthen it, but also give it a pretty appearance. Lay 
round it rock candy sweetmeats. 

Eggs and Bacon in Flummery. 

MAKE part of a pint of stiff flummery of a pretty pink 
colour with cochineal. Then dip a potting pan in cold water, 
and pour in red flummery to the thickness of a crown-piece, 
then the same of white flummery, and another of red, and 
twice the thickness of white flummery at the top. Remember 
that one layer must be stiff and cold before another is added. 
Then take five tea-cups, and put a large spoonful of white 
flummery into each of them, and let them stand all night. 
Then turn the flummery out of the potting pots, on the back 
of a plate, with cold water. Cut the flummery into thin slices, 
and Jay it on a china dish. Then turn the flummery out of 
the cups on the dish, and take a bit out of the top of every 
one, and lay in half a preserved apricot, which will confine 
the syrup from discolouring the flummery, and make it look 
like the yolk of a poached egg. 

A Hedge-Hog. 

BEAT well in a mortar two pounds of blanched almonds, 
with a little canary and orange-flower water to keep them 
from oiling ; having made them into a stiff paste, beat in 
the yolks of twelve eggs and seven whites. Put to it a pint 
of cream, sweeten it with sugar, and set it on a slow fire. 
Keep it constantly stirring till it is thick enough to make it 
into the form of a hedge-Yiog. Then stick it full of blanched 
almonds, slit and stuck up like the bristles of a hedge-hog, and 



296 JELLIES AND SYLLABUBS. 

then put it into a dish. Take a pint of cream, and the yolks 
of four eggs beat up, and sweeten them with sugar to the 
palate. Stir them together over a slow fire till it is quite hot, 
and then pour it into the dish round the hedge-hog, and let it 
stand till it is cold. 

Savoury Jelly. 

PUT into a stewpan some slices of lean veal and ham, with 
a carrot and turnip, or two or three onions. Cover it, and let 
it sweat on a slow fire, till it is of a deep brown: put to it a 
quart of very clear broth, some whole pepper, mace, a very 
little isinglass, and salt to the palate. Let it boil ten minutes, 
then strain it through a tamis, skim off all the fat, and put to it 
the whites of three eggs. Then run it several times through a 
jelly-bag till it is perfectly clear. 

Solid Syllabubs. 

PUT in a pint of white wine to a quart of rich cream, the 
juice of four lemons, and sugar it to the taste. Whip it 
up well, take off the froth as it rises, and put it upon a hair 
sieve. Let it stand till the next day in a cool place, then fill 
glasses better than half full with the thin, put on the froth, and 
heap it as high as possible. It will keep for several days, and 
the bottom look clear. 

Syllabub under the Cow. 

PUT into a punch bowl a pint of cider, and a bottle of 
strong beer. Grate in a small nutmeg, and sweeten it to the 
taste. Then milk from the cow as much milk as will make a 
strong froth. Then let it stand an hour, sirew over it a few 
currants well washed, picked, and plumped before the fire, 
and it will be fit for service. 

Whipt Syllabubs. 

RUB a lump of loaf sugar on the outside of a lemon, put it 
into a pint of thin cream, and sweeten it to the taste. Then 
put in the juice of a lemon, and a glass of Madeira wine or 
French brandy. Mill it to a froth with a chocolate mill, and 
take it off as it rises, and lay it into a hair sieve. Then fill one 
half of the glasses a little more than half full with white wine, 
and the other half of the glasses a little more than half full 
with red wine: lay on the froth as high as possible ; but take 
care that it is well drained on a sieve, otherwise it will mix 
with the wine, and the syllabub will be thereby spoiled. 



JELLIES AND SYLLABUBS. 297 

Lemon Syllabubs. 

RUB a quarter of a pound of loaf sugar upon the out-rind 
of two lemons, to get all the essence out of them, and then 
put the sugar into a pint of cream, and the same quantity of 
white wine; squeeze in the juice of both lemons, and let it 
stand for two hours : then mill it with a chocolate mill to raise 
the froth, and take it off -with a spoon as it rises, or it will make 
it heavy. Lay it upon a hair sieve to drain, then fill the 
glasses with the remainder, and lay on the froth as high as 
possible. Let them stand all night, and they will be clear at 
the bottom. 

Everlasting Syllabubs. 

TAKE half a pint of Rhenish wine, half a pint of sack, with 
the juice of two large Seville oranges, and put them into two 
pints and a half of thick cream. Grate in just the yellow 
rind of three lemons, and put in a pound of double-refined 
sugar well beaten and sifted ; mix all together, with a spoon- 
ful of orange-flower water, and with a whisk beat it well to- 
gether for half an hour. With a spoon take off the froth, 
and lay it on a sieve to drain, and then fill the glasses. These 
will keep better than a week, and should always be made the 
day before they are wanted. The best way to whip a sylla- 
bub, is, have a fine large chocolate mill, which must be kept 
on purpose, and a large deep bowl to mill them in, as this way 
they will be done the quicker, and the froth be the stronger. 
For the thin that is left at the bottom, have ready some calf's 
feet jelly boiled, and clarified, in which must be nothing but 
the calf's feet boiled to a hard jelly. When it is cold, take 
off the fat, clear it with the whites of eggs, run it through a 
flannel bag, and mix -it with the clear that was left of the 
syllabub. Sweeten it to the palate, and give it a boil ; then 
pour it into basons, or glasses. When cold, turn it out, and 
it will be a fine flummery.

CHAPTER VII. 
PRESERVING. 

PRELIMINARY HINTS AND OBSERVATIONS. 

IN making syrfcps for preserves, take care to pound your 
sugar, and let it dissolve in the syrup before you set it on the 
fire, as it will make the scum rise well, and your syrup will 
be of a better colour. It is a great fault to boil any kind of 
syrups or jellies too high, as it makes them dark and cloudy. 
Never keep green sweetmeats longer in, the first, syrup than 
directed, as it will spoil their colour ; |md the same precaution 
will be necessary in the preserving oranges and lemons. When 
you preserve cherries, damsons, of any other sort of stoije- 
fruits, put over them mutton suet rendered, to keep oat the 
air ; for if any air gets to them, it will give them a sour taste, 
and spoil the whole. Wet sweetmeats must be kept in a dry 
and cool place ; for a damp place will mould them, and a hot 
place will deprive them of their virtue. It is a good method 
to dip writing-paper into brandy, and lay it close to the 
sweetmeats. They should be tied well down with white 
paper, and two folds of cap-paper, to keep out the air, as 
nothing can be a greater fault than leaving the pots open, or 
tying them down carelessly. 

Gooseberries preserved whole. 

TAKE the largest gooseberries, and .pick off" the black eye, 
but not the stalk ; set them over the fire in a pot of water to 
scald, but take care they do not boil, for that will break and 
spoil them: when tender, take them up and put them into 
cold water. Then rake a pound and a half of double-refined 
sugar to a pound qf gooseberries, and clarify the sugar with 
water, a pint to a pound. of sugar. When the syrup is cold, 
put the gooseberries singly into the preserving pan, put the 
syrup to them, and set them on a gentle Ji re. Let them boil, 
but not so fast as to break them ; and when they have boiled, 
and the sugar has entered them, take them off, cover them with 
white paper, and set them by till the next day. Then take 
them out of the syrup, and boil the syrup till it begins to be 
ropy. Skim it, and put it to them again. Then set them on a 
gentle fire, and let them simmer gently till the syrup will

rope. Then take them off", set them by till they are cold, and 
cover them with brandy-paper, Then boil some gooseberries 
in water, and when the liquor is strong enough, strain it out. 
Let it stand to settle, and to every pint take a pound of double- 
refined sugar, and make a jelly of it. When the gooseberries 
ar cold, put them in glasses, cover them with the jelly, and 
close them down properly. 

Green Gooseberries, in Imitation of Hops. 

TAKE the largest green walnut gooseberries, and cut them 
at the stalk-end in four quarters. Leave them whole at the 
blossom, end, take out all the seeds and put five or six one in 
another. Take a needleful of strong thread, with a large 
knot at the end ; run the needle through the bunch of goose- 
berries, tie a knot to fasten them together, and they will 
resemble hops. Put cold spring-water into the pan, with a 
large handful of vine-leaves at the bottom j then three or 
four layers of gooseberries, with plenty of vine-leaves be- 
tween every layer, and ov*er the top of the pan. Cover it 
so that no steam can get out, and set them on a slow fire. 
Then take them off as soon as they are scalding hot, and let 
them stand till cold. Then set them on again till they are of 
a good green; take them off, and let them stand till quite cold. 
Put them into a sieve to drain, and make a thin syrup thus : 
To every pint of water put in a pound of common loaf 
sugar ; boil, and skim it well. When about half cold, put in 
the gooseberries, and let them stand till the next day. Then 
give them one boil a day for three days* Then make a syrup 
thus : To every pint of water put in a pound of fine sugar, a 
slice of ginger, and a lemon peel cut lengthways exceedingly 
fine. Boil rfhd skim it well, give the gooseberries a boil in it, 
and when cold, put them into glasses or pots, lay brandy- 
paper over them, and tie them up close. 

Red Gooseberries. 

TAKE a pound of loaf sugar, put it into a preserving pan, 
with as much water as will dissolve it, and boil and skim it 
well ; then put in a quart of rough red gooseberries, and let 
them boil a little. Set them by till the next day, then boil 
them till they Jook;clear, arid the syrup thick. Then put them 
into pots or glasses, and cover^hem with brandy-paper. 

Red Raspberries. . 

GATHER them on a dry day when just turning red, with 
the stalks on, about an inch long. Lay them singly on a disb, 



300 PRESERVING, 

beat and sift their weight of double-refined sugar, and strew 
it over them. To every quart of raspberries take a quart of 
red currant jelly-juice, and put to it its weight of double- 
refined sugar. Boil and skim it well, then put in the rasp, 
berries, and give them a scald. Take them off, and let them 
stand for two hours. Set them on again, and make them a 
little hotter ; proceed in this manner two or three times till 
they look clear ; but do not let them boil, as that will make 
the stalks come off. When tolerably cool, put them into jelly 
glasses, with the stalks downwards. 

White Raspberries 

MAY be preserved in the same manner, only using white 
currant juice instead of red. 

Red Currants. 

STONE them, and tie six or seven bunches together with a 
thread to a piece of split deal, .about four inches long. 
\\cigh the currants, and put the weight of double-refined 
sugar into the preserving pan, with a little water. Boil it till 
the sugar flies; then put the currants in, just give them a boil 
up, and cover them till the next day. Then take them out, 
and either dry them or put them into glasses, with the syrup 
boiled up with a little of the juice of red currants. Put 
brandy-paper over them, then other paper over that, and tie 
them down close. 

White Currants preserved in Bunches. 

STONE and tie them in bunches, as above directed, put 
them into the preserving pan, with their v. eight of double- 
rehned sugar beaten and finel> sifted, Let them stand all 
night. 1 hen take some pippins, pare, core, and boil them, 
and press them down with the back of a spoon, but do not 
stir them. When the water is strong of the apple, add to it 
the juice of a lemon, and strain it through a jelly-bag till it 
runs quite clear. To every pint of liquor put a pound of 
double-refined sugar, and boil it up to a strong jelly. Then 
put it t,o the currants, and boil them till they look clear. 
Cover them in the preserving-pan with paper till they are 
almost cold, and then put a bunch of currants into glasses, 
and fill them up with jelly. When cold, wet paper in brandy, 
and lay over them; then put over them another paper, and tie 
them' up close. 



PRESERVING. 30 1 



Currants preserved for Tarts. 

To every pound and a quarter of picked currants take a 
pound of sugar. Put the sugar into a preserving-pan, with 
as much juice of currants as will dissolve it. As soon as it 
boils, skim it, and put in the currants, and boil them till they 
are clear. Put them into a jar, lay brandy-paper over them, 
and tie them down close. 

Green Codlins. 

GREEN codlins will keep all the year, if preserved in this 
manner : gather them when about the size of a walnut, with 
the stalks and a leaf or two on them. Put a handful of vine- 
leaves into a pan of spring water ; then put a layer of cod- 
lins, then of vine-leaves, #nd so on till the pan is full. Cover 
it close that no steam can get out, and set it on a slow fire. 
As soon as they are soft, take off the skins with a penknife, 
and then put them in the same water with the vine-leaves, 
which must be quite cold, or it will be apt to crack them. 
Put in a little alum, and set them over a very slow fire till 
they are green, which will be in three or four hours. Then 
take them out, and lay them on a sieve to drain. Make a 
good syrup, and give them a gentle boil once a day for three 
days. Then put them into small jars, with brandy-paper over 
them, and tie them up tight. 

Golden Pippins. 

HAVING boiled the rind of an orange very tender, let it lie 
in water two or three days. Take a quart of golden pippins, 
pare, core, quarter, and boil them to a strong jelly, and run 
it through a jelly-bag. Then take twelve pippins, pare them, 
and scrape out the cores. Put two pounds of loaf sugar into 
a stewpan with near a pint of water. When it boils, skim it, 
and put in the pippins, with the orange rind in thin slices. 
Let them boil fast till the sugar is very thick and will almost 
candy. Then put in a pint of the pippin jelly, and boil them 
fast till the jelly is clear. Then squeeze in the juice of a le- 
mon, give it a boil, and put them into pots or glasses with the 
orange peel. 



Grapes. 

PUT into ajar some close bunches of grapes, but they must 
not be too ripe ; it matters not whether they are black or 
white grapes. Put to them a quarter of a pound of sugar- 



302 PRESERVING. 

candy, and fill the jar with common brandy. Tie them up 
close with a bladder, and set them in a dry place. Morello 
cherries may be preserved in the same manner. 

Walnuts (white). 

PARE them till the white appear, and nothing else ; as fast 
as they are clone, throw them into salt and water, and let them 
lie there till the sugar is ready. Take three pounds of good 
loaf sugar, put it into the preserving-pan, set it over a charcoal 
fire, and put as much water as will just wet the sugar : let it 
boil, then have ready ten or a dozen whites of eggs strained 
and beat up to a froth. Cover the sugar with the froth as it 
boils, and skim it; then boil it, and skim it till it is quite clear, 
and throw in the walnuts. Just give them a boil till they are 
tender, then take them out, and lay them in a dish to cool. 
When cold, put them into the preserving-pot, and when the 
sugar is as warm as milk pour it over them ; and when they are 
quite cold, tie them up. 

Walnuts (black ). 

TAKE those of the smaller kind ; put them in salt and 
water, and change the water every day for nine days; thei> 
put them on a sieve, and let them stand in the air till they 
begin to turn black. Put them into a jug, pour boiling water 
over them, and let them stand till the next day. Then put 
them into a sieve to drain, stick a clove in each end of the 
walnut, put them into a pan of boiling water, and let them 
boil five minutes. Take them up, make a thin syrup, and 
scald them in it three or four times a day, till the walnuts are 
black and bright. Then make a thick syrup with a few cloves 
and a little ginger cut in slices ; skim it well, put in the wat- 
nuts, boil them five or six minutes, and then put them inco 
jars. Lay brandy-paper over them, and tie them down close 
with a bladder. They will eat better the second year of their 
keeping than in the first, as the bitterness goes off with time. 

Walnuts (green). 

WIPE them very dry, and lay them in salt and water twenty- 
four hours ; take them out, and wipe them very clean ; have 
ready a skillet of boiling water, throw them in, let them boil a 
minute, and then take them out. Lay them on a coarse cloth, 
and boil the sugar as directed for the white walnuts; then 
just give the walnuts a scald in the sugar, take them up, and' 
lay them to cool. Put them into the preserving-pot, and pro- 
ceed as directed for white walnuts. 



PRESERVING. 303 

Cucumbers* 

TAKE the greenest cucumbers, and the most free from 
seeds ; some small to preserve whole, anil other large to cut 
into pieces. Put them into strong salt and water in a strait- 
mouthed jar with a cabbage-leaf to keep them down. Set 
them in a warm place till they are yellow, then wash them 
out, and set them over the fire in fresh water, with a little 
salt, and a fresh cabbage-leaf over them : cover the pan very 
close, but take care they do not boil. If they are not of a 
fine green, change the water, as that will help them. Then 
cover them as before, and make them hot ; when they be- 
come of a good green, take them off the fire, and let them 
stand till cold. Then cut the large ones in quarters, take out 
the seeds and soft part, put them into cold water, and let them 
stand two days ; but change the water twice every day to take 
out the salt. Take a pound of single-refined sugar, and half 
a pint of water, set it over the fire, and when it is skimmed 
clean, put in the rind of a lemon, and an ounce of ginger, 
with the outside scraped off. When the syrup is pretty thick, 
take it off j and when cold, wipe the cucumbers dry, and 
put them in. Boil the syrup once in two or three days for 
three weeks, and strengthen the syrup, if required ; for the 
greatest danger of spoiling them is at first. When the syrup 
is put to the cucumbers, be sure that it is quite cold. 

Green Gage Plums. 

PUT into a pan the finest plums just before they are ripe : 
put vine-leaves at the bottom of the pan, then a layer of plums, 
and thus plums and vine-leaves alternately till the pan is al- 
most full: then fill it with water, set them over a slow fire, 
and when hot, and their skins begin to break, take them off, 
and take the skins off carefully. Put them on a sieve as they 
are done, then lay them in the same water, with a layer of 
leaves between, and cover them very close, so that no steam 
can get out. Hang them at a great distance from the fire till 
they are green, which will be five or six hours at least. Then 
take them carefully up, lay them on a hair sieve to drain, 
make a good syrup, and give them a gentle boil in it twice 
a day for two days. Take them out, and put them into a fine 
clear syrup ; put brandy-paper over them, and tie them down 
close. 

Damsons. 

CUT the damsons into pieces, and put them in a skillet over 
the fire, with as much water as will cover then. When they 



304 PRESERVING. 

are boiled, and the liquor pretty strong, strain it out, and add 
to every pound of the damsons, wiped clean, a pound of single- 
refined sugar. Put one third of the sugar in the liquor, set 
it over the fire, and when it simmers, put in the damsons. Let 
them have one good boil, and take them off for half an hour 
covered up close. Then set them on again, and let them sim- 
mer over the fire after turning them. Then take them out, 
put them in a bason, strew all the sugar that was left on them, 
and pour the hot liquor over them. Cover them up, let them 
stand till the next day, and then boil, them up again till they 
are enough. Then take them up, and put them in pots ; 
boil the liquor till it jellies, and pour it on them when almost 
cold. Put paper over them, and tie them up close. 

Mordlo Cherries. 

HAVING gathered cherries when they are full ripe, take off 
the stalks, and prick them with ^a pin. To everv pound of 
cherries put a pound and a half of loaf sugar.' Beat part of 
the sugar, strew it over them, and let them stand all night. 
Dissolve the rest of the sugar in. half a pint of the iuice of 
currants, set it over a slow fire, and put in the cherries with 
the sugar, and give them a gentle scald. Then take them 
carefully out, boil the syrup till it is thick, and pour it upon 
the cherries. 

Lemons. 

FIRST pare the lemons very thin, then make a round hole 
on the top of the size of a shilling, and take out all the pulps 
and skins; rub them with salt, and put them into spring 
water, which will prevent them from turning black : let them 
lie in it five or six days, and then boil them in fresh salt and 
water fifteen minutes. Have ready made a thin syrup of a 
quart of water, and a pound of loaf sugar. Boil them in it for 

' five minutes once a day, for four or five days, and then put 
them in a large jar. Let them stand for six or eight weeks, 
and it will make them look clear and plump. Then take them 
out of that syrup, or they will mould ; make a syrup of fine 
sugar, put as much water to it as will dissolve it, boil and skim 
it, then put in the lemons, and boil them gently till they are 
clear. Put them into a jar with brandy-paper over them, and 

. and tie them down close. 

Oranges. 

CUT a hole out of a Seville orange at the stalk-end as large 
as a sixpence, and scoop out the pulp quite clean ; tie them 



PRESERVING. 305 

separately in muslin, and lay them two days in spring water. 
Change the water twice every day, and then boil them in the 
muslin on a slow fire till quite tender. As the water wastes, 
put more hot water into the pan, and keep them covered. 
Weigh the oranges before they are scooped, and to every 
pound put two pounds of double-refined sugar, and a pint of 
water : boil the sugar and water, with the juice of the oranges, 
to a syrup; skim it well, let it stand till cold, then put in the 
oranges, and let them boil half an hour. If not quite clear, 
boil them once a day for two or.three days. Then pare and 
core some green pippins, and boil them till the water is 
strong of the apple ; but do not stir them, and only put them 
down with the back of a spoon. Strain the water through a 
jelly-bag till it is quite clear, and then, to every pint of water, 
put a pound of double-refined sugar, and the juice of a lemon 
strained fine. Boil it up to a strong jelly, drain the oranges 
out of the syrup, and put them into glass jars, or pots of the 
size of an orange, with the, -holes upwards. ^Po'ur the jelly 
over them, cover them with paper dipped in brandy, and t;e 
them close down with a bladder. Lemons may be done in 
this manner, if preferred to the method before directed. 

Strawberries. 

ON a dry day, gather the finest scarlet strawberries, with 
their stalks on, before they are too ripe ; lay them separately 
on a china dish, beat and sift twice their weight of double- 
refined sugar, and strew it over them. Then take a few ripe 
scarlet strawberries, crush them, and put them into a jar, with 
their weight of double-refined sugar beat small. Cover them 
close, and let them stand in a kettle of boiling water till they 
are soft, and the syrup come out of them. Then strain them 
through a muslin rag into a tossing-pan, boil and skim it well, 
and when cold, put in the whole strawberries, and set them 
over the fire till they are milk warm. Then take them off, 
and let them stand till quite cold. Then set them on again, 
and make them a little hotter, and do so several times till 
they look clear ; but do not let them boil, as that will bring 
off their stalks. When the strawberries are cold, put them 
into jelly -glasses, with the stalks downwards, and fill up the' 
glasses with the syrup. Put over them paper dipped in bran- 
dy, and tie them down close. 

Pine-apples. 

TAKE pine-apples before they are ripe, and lay them five 
days in strong salt and water. . Then put into the bottom oi'u 
large saucepan a handful of vine-leaves, and put in the pine- 

x 



PRESERVING. 

apples. Fill the pan with vine-leaves, and then pour on the 
salt and water they were laid in. Cover it up very close, and 
set them over a slow fire. Let them stand till of a fine light 
green. Have ready a thin syrup, made of a quart of water 
and a pound of double-refined sugar. When it is almost cold, 
put it into a deep jar, and put in the pine-apples with their 
tops on. Let them stand a week, and take care that they are 
well covered with the syrup. It is a great fault to put any kind 
of fruit that is to be preserved whole into thick syrup at first, 
as that makes it shrink, draws out the juice, and spoils it. 
When they have stood a week, boil the syrup again, and pour 
it carefully into the jar, for fear of breaking the tops of the 
pine-apples. Let it stand eight or ten weeks, and during that 
time give the syrup two or three boilings to keep it from 
moulding. Let the syrup stand till it is near cold before it is 
put on ; and when the pine-apples look quite full and green, 
take them out of the syrup, and make a thick syrup of three 
pounds of double-refined sugar, with as much water as will 
dissolve it : boil and skim it well, put a few slices of white 
ginger into it, and when it is nearly cold, pour it upon the 
pine-apples. Tie them down close with a bladder, and they 
will keep many years without shrinking. 

Barberries for Tarts. 

HAVING picked the female branches clean from the stalks, 
take their weight in loaf sugar, and put them in a jar. Set 
them in a kettle of boiling water till the sugar is melted and 
the barberries quite soft. Then next dayput them into a pre- 
serving-pan, and boil them fifteen minutes. Then put them 
into jars, and tie them up close. 

Barberries preserved in Bunches. 

HAVING procured the finest female barberries, pick out all 
the largest bunches, and then pick the rest from the stalks ; 
put them in as much water as will make a syrup for the 
bunches; boil them till they are soft, then strain them through a 
sieve, and to every pint of the juice put a pound and a half 
of loaf sugar. Boil and skim it well, and to every pint of 
syrup put half a pound of barberries in bunches. Boil them 
till they look very fine and clear, then put them carefully 
into pots or glasses, and tie them down close with brandy- 
paper. 

Quinces. 

QUINCES may be preserved either whole, or in quarters, in 
this manner : Having pared them very thin and round (or cut 



DRYJNG AND CANDYING. 307 

U| 

into quarters), put them into a saucepan, fill it with hard 
water, and lay the parings over the quinces to keep them 
down. Cover the saucepan close, that no steam may get* out, 
and set them over a slow fire till they are soft, and of a fine 
pink colour. Then let them stand till they are cold. Make 
a good syrup of double-refined sugar, and boil and skim it 
well. Then put in the quinces, let them" boil ten minutes, take 
them off, and let them stand two or three hours. Boil them 
till the syrup looks thick, and the quinces clear. Put them 
into deep jars, and with brandy-paper and leather over them, 
tie them up close. 

Peaches. 

LET the peaches be the largest, but not too ripe : rub off 
the lint with a cloth, and then run them down the seam with 
a pin, skin deep, and cover them with French brandy : tie a 
bladder over them, and let them stand a week. Take them 
out, and make a strong syrup for them. Boil and skiui it 
well, then put in the peaches, and boil them till they look 
clear: take them out, and put them into pots or glasses ; mix 
the syrup with the brandy, and when it is cold, pour it on the 
peaches. Tie them close down with a bladder, as they will 
turn black should the air get to them. 

Apricots. 

HAVING pared the apricots, thrust out the stones with a 
skewer, and to every pound of apricots put a pound- of loaf 
sugar; strew part of it over them, and let it stand till the next 
day ; then give them a gentle boil three or four different 
times, and let them cool between each time : take them out 
of the syrup one by one, the last time they are boiled. Skim 
the syrup well, then pour it over the apricots, and tie them 
down close with brandy-paper and a bladder.

DRYING AND CANDYING. 

PRELIMINARY HINTS AND OBSERVATIONS. 

iivERY kind of fruit, before you attempt to candy it, musfc 
be first preserved, and dried in a stqve or before the fire, that 
none of the syrup may remain in it. Then, having boiled

your sugar to the candy height, dip in your fruit, and lay 
them in dishes in your stove to dry. Then put them in boxes 
for use, and take care to keep them in places neither damp 
nor hot. 

Candied Cassia. 

TAKE as much of the powder of brown cassia as will lie 
upon two shillings, with as much musk and ambergris as is 
thought proper: the cassia and perfume must be powdered 
together. Then take a quarter of a pound of sugar, and boil 
it to a candy height, put in the powder and mix it well toge- 
ther. Pour it into saucers, which must be buttered very thin, 
and when it is cold it will slip out. 

Orange Marmalade. 

CUT in twothe clearest Seville oranges; take out all the pulp 
and juice into a bason, and pick all the skins and seeds out 
of it ; boil the rinds in hard water till they are tender, and 
change the water two or three times while they are boiling. 
Then pound them in a marble mortar, and add to them the juice 
and pulp; put them into the preserving-pan with double their 
weight of loaf sugar, and set them over a slow fire. Boil it 
rather more than half an hour, put into pots, cover with 
brandy-paper, and tie close down. 

Apricot Marmalade. 

ALL those apricots that are not good enough for preserves, 
or are too ripe for keeping, will answer this purpose ; boil 
them in syrup till they will mash, and then beat them in a 
marble mortar to a paste : take half their weight of loaf 
sugar, and put just water enough to it to dissolve it ; boil and 
skim it till it looks clear, and the syrup thick like a fine jelly. 
Then put it into sweetmeat glasses, and tie it up close. 

Transparent Marmalade. 

CUT very pale Seville oranges into quarters, take out the 
pulp, put it into a bason, and pick out the skins and seeds. 
Put the peels into a little salt and water, and let them stand 
all night. Then boil them in a good quantity of spring water 
till they are tender, cut them in very thin slices, and put them 
to the pulp. To every pound of marmalade put a pound and 
a half of double-refined sugar finely beaten, and boil them 
together gently for twenty minutes ; but if it is not clear and 
transparent in that time, boil it five or six minutes longer, 
keep fctirringik gently all the time, and take care not to break 



DRYING AND CANDYING. 309 

the slices. When cold, put it into jelly or sweetmeat glasses, 
and tie them down tight with brandy-paper, and a bladder 
over them. 

Quince Marmalade. 

QUINCES for this purpose must be full ripe; pare them and 
cut them into quarters ; then take out the core, and put them 
into a saucepan. Cover them with the parings, fill the sauce- 
pan nearly full of spring water, cover it close, and let 
them stew over a slow fire till they are soft, and of a pink 
colour. Then pick out all the quinces from the parings, and 
beat them to a pulp in a marble mortar. Take their weight 
of fine loaf sugar, put as much water to it as will dissolve it, 
and boil and skim it well. Then put in the quinces, and boil 
them gently three quarters of an hour. Stir all the time, or 
it will stick to the pan and burn. When cold, put it into fiat 
pots, and tie it down close. 

Damson Cheese. 

HAVING picked the damsons free from stalks, put them into 
ajar, tie white paper over them, and bake in an oven till 
quite soft : rub through a cullender whilst hot, and to the 
pulp and juice add sugar to the palate: boil over a gentle 
fire till nearly quite stiff, stir all the time that it m t ^ not burn, 
and turn into moulds, or cups : tie brandy-paper over them, 
and keep in a dry but not hot place. 

Plum Cheese, 
Is made like damson cheese. 

Bullace Cheese, 
Is made like damson cheese. 

Apple Cheese. 

PARE, quarter, and core the apples ; put them into a jar, 
tie them over with white paper, and bake in an oven till quite 
soft : pulp them through a sieve ; put the pulp into a stewpan 
with sifted lump sugar to the palate, and a little thin rind of 
lemon, boil till quite stiff, and put into moulds. 

Raspberry Paste. 

TAKE a quart of raspberries, mash them, strain one half, and 
put the juice to the other half; boil them a quarter of an 
hour, put to them a pint of red currant juice^nd let them 



310 DRYING AND CANDYING. 

boil all together till the raspberries are enough. Then put 
a pound and a half of double-refined sugar into a clean pan, 
with as much water as will dissolve it, aud boil it to a sugar 
again. Then put in the raspberries and juice, give them a 
scald, and pour them into glasses or plates. Then put them 
into a stove to dry, and turn them when necessary. 

Currant Paste. 

CURRANT paste may be either red or white, according to 
the colour of the currants used. Strip the currants, put a 
little juice to them to keep them from burning, boil them 
well, and rub them through a hair sieve. Then boil it a 
quarter of an hour, and to a pint of juice put a pound and a 
half of double-refined sugar pounded and sifted. Shake in 
the sugar, and when it is melted, pour it on plates. Dry it in 
the same manner as the above paste, and turn it into any form 
most approved. 

Gooseberry Paste. 

WHEN red gooseberries are full grown and turned, but not 
ripe, cut them in halves, pick out all the seeds; then have 
ready a pint of currant juice, and boil the gooseberries in it 
till they are tender. Put a pound and a half of double-re- 
fined suga^into the pan, with as much water as will dissolve 
it, and boil it to a sugar again : then put all together, and 
make it scalding hot, but do not let it boil. Pour it into 
palates or glasses, and dry it as above directed. 

Burnt Almonds. 

PUT two pounds of almonds, the same quantity of loaf 
sugar, and a pint of water, into a stewpan. Set them over a 
clear coal fire, and let them boil till the almonds crack. Then 
take them off, and stir them about till they are quite dry. 
Put them in a wire sieve, and sift all the sugar from them. 
Put all in the pan again with a little water, and give it a boil : 
then put four spoonsful of scraped cochineal to the sugar to 
colour it; put the almonds into the pan, and keep stirring 
them over the fire till they are quite dry. Then put them 
nto a glass, and they will keep a year. 

Orange Chips. 

PARE some of the best Seville oranges a-slant, about a 
quarter of an inch broad, and if kept whole they will have a 
prettier effect: put them into salt and spring water for a day 
or two ; then boil them in a large quantity of spring water 



DRYING AND CANDYING. 311 

till they are tender, and drain them on a sieve. Have ready 
a thin syrup, made of a quart of water, and a pound of fine 
sugar. Boil them, a few at a time, to keep them from break- 
ing, till they look clear. Then put them into a syrup made 
of fine loaf sugar, with as much water as will dissolve it, and 
boil them to a candy height. When taken up, lay them on at 
sieve, and grate double-refined sugar over them. Then put 
them in a stove, or before the fire to dry. 

Green Gage Plums dried. 

HAVING made a thin syrup of half a pound of single- 
refined sugar, and skimmed it well, slit a pound of plums 
down the seam, and put them in the syrup. Keep them scald- 
ing hot till they are tender, and take care they are well 
covered with syrup, or they Avill lose their colour. Let them 
stand all night, and then make a rich syrup. To a pound of 
double-refined sugar put two spoonsful of water, skim it well, 
and boil it almost to a candy. When cold, drain the plums 
out of the first syrup, and put them into the thick syrup ; but 
be sure to let the syrup cover them. Set them on the fire to 
scald till they look clear, and then put them in a china bowl. 
When they have stood a week, take them out, and Jay them on 
china dishes. Then put them in a stove, and turn them once 
a day till they are dry. 

Cherries dried. 

STONE any quantity of morello cherries, and to every pound 
of cherries put a pound and a quarter of fine sugar: beat it 
and sift it over the cherries, and let them stand all night : 
take them out of the sugar, and to every pound of sugar put 
two spoonsful of water ; boil and skim it well, and then put in 
the cherries. Let the sugar boil over them, the next morning 
strain them, and to every pound of the syrup put half a pound 
more sugar. Let it Doil a little thicker, then put in the 
cherries, and let them boil gently. The next day strain them, 
put them into a stove to dry, and mind every day to turn 
them. 

Damsons dried. 

DAMSONS for this purpose must be gathered when they are 
full ripe. Spread them on a coarse cloth, and set them in a 
very cool oven. Let them stand a day or two ; and if they 
are not then properly dried, put them in for a day or two 
longer. Take them out, lay them in a dry place, and even in 
.the winter they will eat like fresh plums. 



312 DRYING AND CANDYING. 



Apricots dried. 

PARE and stone a pound of apricots, and put them into a 
tossing-pan ; pound and sift half a pound of double-refined 
sugar, strew a little amongst them, and lay the rest over them. 
Let them stand twenty-four hours, turn them three or four 
times in the syrup, and then boil them pretty quick till they 
look clear. When cold, take them out and lay them on 
glasses. Then put them into a stove, and turn them the first 
day every half hour, the second day every hour, and so on till 
they are dry. 

Peaches dried. 

GET the largest Newington peaches, and pare and stone 
them : put them into a saucepan of boiling water, let them 
boil till tender, and then lay them on a sieve to drain. Weigh 
them, and with their weight in sugar cover them in the pan 
they were boiled in. Let them lie two or three hours, then 
boil them till they are clear, and the syrup pretty thick. 
Cover them close, and let them stand all night ; scald them 
well, and then take them off to cool. Then set them on again 
till the peaches are thoroughly hot, and do this for three days. 
Then lay them, on plates, and turn them every day till they 
are dry. 

Ginger candied. 

TAKE an ounce of race ginger grated fine, a pound of loaf 
sugar beat fine, and put into a tossing-pan with as much water 
as will dissolve it : stir them well together over a very slow 
fire till the sugar begins to boil. Then stir in another pound 
of sug.ir beat fine, and keep stirring till it grows thick. Then 
take it off the fire, and drop it in cakes upon earthen dishes. 
Set them in a warm place to dry, and they will be hard and 
brittle, and look white. 

Lemon and Orange Peels candied. 

TAKE either lemons or oranges, cut them long ways, take 
out the pulp, and put all the rinds into a pretty strong- salt and 
hard water for six days: then boil them in a large quantity of 
spring water till they are tender ; take them out, and lay them 
on a hair sieve to drain : then make a thin syrup of fine loaf 
sugar, a pound to a quart of water ; put in the peels, and boil 
them over a slow fire till the syrup and candy may be perceived 
about the pan and peels. Then take them out, and grate fine 
sugar all over them. Lay them on a hair sieve to drain, and. 



ORNAMENTS. 313 

set them in a stove, or before the fire, to dry. Remember 
when either lemons or oranges are boiled, not to cover the 
saucepan. 

Angelica candied. 

CUT the angelica in lengths when young, cover it close, 
and boil it till it is tender; then peel it, put it in again, and 
let it simmer, and boil it till it is green : take it up, and dry 
it with a cloth, and to every pound of stalks put a pound of 
sugar. Put the stalks into an earthen pan, beat the sugar, 
and strew it over them, and let them stand two days. Then 
boil it till it is clear and green, and put it in a cullender to 
drain. Beat another pound of sugar to powder, and strew 
it on the angelica. Lay it on plates to dry, and set them in 
the oven after the pies are drawn. 



CHAPTER IX. 

ELEGANT ORNAMENTS FOR A GRAND 
ENTER TAINMENT. 

Floating Island. 

1 AKE a soup-dish, of a size proportionate to what is intended 
to be made ; but a deep glass, set on a china dish, will an- 
swer the purpose better. Take a quart of the thickest cream, 
and make it pretty sweet with fine sugar. Pour in a gill of 
sack, grate in the yellow rind of a lemon, and mill the cream 
till it is of a thick froth. Then carefully pour the thin from 
the froth into a dish. Cut a French roll, or as many as are 
wanted, as thin as possible, and put a layer of it as light as 
possible on the cream, then a layer of currant jelly, then a 
very thin layer of roll, then hartshorn jelly, then French roll, 
and over that whip the froth saved of the cream, well milled 
up, and lay it on the top as high as possible. The rim of the 
dish may be ornamented with figures, fruit, or sweetmeats. 

Chinese Temple or Obelisk. 

TAKE an ounce of fine sugar, half an ounce of butter, and 
four ounces of fine flour ; boil the sugar and butter in a little 
water, and when cold, beat an egg, and put it to the water, 



3 1 4 ORNAMENTS. 



r, and butter : mix it with the flour, and make into a very 
stiff paste. Then roll it as thin as possible, have a set of tins 
the form of a temple, and put the paste upon them. Cut it in 
the form intended upon the separate parts of the tins, keeping 
them separate till baked ; but take care to have the paste 
exactly the size of the tins. When all the parts are cut, bake 
them in a slow oven, and Avhen cold, take them out of the 
tins, and join the parts with strong isinglass and water with a 
camel's hair brush. Set them one upon the other, as the 
forms of the tin moulds will direct. If cut neatly, and the 
paste is rolled very thin, it will be a beautiful corner for a large 
table. Take care to make the pillars stronger than the top, 
that they may not be crushed by their weight. 

Desert Island. 

FORM a lump of paste into a rock three inches broad, at 
the top. Then colour it, and set it in the middle of a deep 
china dish. Set a cast figure on it with a crown on its head, 
and a knot of rock candy at its feet. Then make a roll of 
paste an inch thick, and stick it on the inner edge of the dish, 
two parts round. Cut eight pieces of eringo roots, about 
three inches long, and fix them upright to the roll of paste 
on the edge. Make gravel walks of shot comfits round the 
dish, and set small figures in them. Roll out some paste, and 
cut it open like Chitiese rails. Bake it, and fix it on either 
side of the gravel walks with gum, and form an entrance where 
the Chinese raHs are, with two pieces of eringo rook for 
pillars. 

Moonshine. 

HAVE a piece of tin in the shape of a half-moon, as deep 
as a half pint bason, and one in the shape of a large star, and 
two or three lesser ones : boil two calf's feet in a gallon of 
water till it comes to a quart, then strain it off, and when 
cold, skim off the fat. Take half the jelly, and sweeten it with 
sugar to the palate. Beat up the whites of four eggs, stir all 
together over a slow fire till it boils, and then run it through 
a flannel bag till clear. Put it in a clean saucepan, and take 
an ounce or sweet almonds blanched, and beat very fine in a 
marble mortar, with two spoonsful of rose-water, and two of 
orange-flower water. Then strain it through a coarse cloth, 
mix it with the jelly, stir in four spoonsful of thick cream, and 
stir it all together till it boils. Then have ready the dish in- 
tended for it, lay the tin in the shape of a half moon in the 
middle, and the stars round it. Lay little weights on the tins 
to keep them in their places ; then pour in the above blanc 



ORNAMENTS. 3 1 5 

mange into the dish : and when 'it is quite cold, take out the 
tins. Fill up the vacancies with clear calf's feet jelly. Or, 
colour the blanc mange with cochineal and chocolate, to make 
it look like the sky, and the moon and stars will then shine the 
brighter. Put round it rock-candy sweetmeats for a garnish. 

A Dish of Snow. 

- PUT twelve large apples into cold water, set them over a 
slow fire, and when they are soft pour them upon a hair sieve, 
Take off the skins, and put the pulp into a bason. Then 
beat the whites of twelve eggs to a very strong froth, beat 
and sift half a pound of double-refined sugar, and strew it 
into the eggs. Then beat the pulp of the apples to a strong 
froth, and beat them all together till they are like a stiff snow, 
lay it upon a china dish, and heap it up as high as possible. 
Set round it green knots of paste in imitation of Chinese rails, 
and stick a sprig of myrtle in the middle of the dish. 

Artificial Fruit. 

AT a proper time of the year take care to save the stalks of 
the fruit with the stones to them. Then get some tins neatly 
made in the shape of the fruit intended to be made, leaving a 
hole at the top to put in the stone and stalk. They must be 
so contrived as to open in the middle, to take out the fruit, 
and there must also be made a frame of wood to fix them in. 
Great care must be taken to make the tins very smooth in 
the inside, otherwise their roughness will mark the fruit; and 
that they are made exactly the shape of the fruit they are in- 
tended to represent. A defect in either of these points will 
not only give deformity to the artificial fruit, but likewise rob 
the artist of that honour he might otherwise acquire. Being 
thus prepared with tins, take two cow-heels and a calf's foot ; 
boil them in a gallon of soft water till they are all boiled to 
rags, and when reduced to a full quart of jelly, strain it 
through a sieve. Then put it into a saucepan, sweeten it, put 
in lemon peel perfumed, and colour it like the fruit intended to 
imitate. Stir all together, give it a boil, and fill the tins. Then 
put in the stones and the stalks just as the fruit grows ; and 
when the jelly is quite cold, open the tins, and put on the 
bloom, which may be done by carefully dusting on powder- 
blue. An ingenious person may make great improvement on 
these artificial fruits ; but it requires great nicety and long 
practice to perfect them in it. 

The hedge-hog, the hen and chickens in jelly, the Solo- 
mon's temple, and the eggs and bacon, &c. in flummery, al- 
ready given, may, with propriety, be classed among the ele- 
gant ornaments for a grand entertainment. 



INSTRUCTIONS FOR CARVING. 



INSTRUCTIONS FOR CARVING. 



Meat. 

1 HE cook must take care that the butcher divides the joints 
of the bones of all carcase-joints of mutton, lamb, veal, and 
pork, which may then be easily and handsomely separated ; 
but the art of carving neatly depends less upon strength than 
skill. The fleshy joints should be helped in thin slices, and 
neatly and smoothly cut. 

Poultry. 

IN carving turkey, goose, duck, or wild fowl, there will be 
more prime pieces, if slices are taken from the breast, instead 
of making wings. 

Fish. 

IN helping fish, make use of a fish-knife, which is less liable 
to break the flakes, and contributes to the* beauty of its ap- 
pearance. 

Beef Sirloin. 

CUT ofY the out- 
side slice quite 
down to the bone, 
in the direction-c d, 
and cut slices of a 
moderate thickness 
smoothly, and pa- 
rallel with the first 
slice : or, cut thro' 
the middle, quite 

down to the bone, 

in the direction of a b ; in either case, helping to a little fat. 
By some the inside is preferred, which must be cut across the 
inside of the bones. 




INSTRUCTIONS FOR CARVING, 



317 




Beef- Edgebone. 

WITH a properbeef- 
knife, cut off the out- 
side slice beginning at 
a and ending at b. The 
soft fat which lies on 
the back of the bone 
below d, very much 
resembles marrow; the 
firm fat must be cut in 
thin horizontal slices, 
at the edge of the meat c. The upper part is most full of 
gravy, enriched with fat, and most tender; but the under 
side is sometimes preferred, because more lean and dry. 

Beef Brisket. 

THE brisket is gene- 
rally cut in neat slices, 
in the direction of a to 
b, quite down to the 
bone ; but some like it 
cut in the direction of 
c to d. The fat of the 
upper side is most firm, 

and somewhat gristly; , 

but that on the under side is softer and more delicate. 

Mutton Leg. 

CUT down quite 
to the bone, in the 
line of a b, which 
goes through the 
kernel called the 
pope's eye; help 
in deep thin slices 
forward to e. The 
back of the leg al- 
so furnishes some 
very fine slices; 
and must be cut in the direction of b to g. The fat lies in 
the direction of e e, and must be cut from e to f. Tro take 
out the cramp bone, pass the knife from d to c. 





318 



INSTRUCTIONS FOR CARVING. 





Mutton Sh oulder. 

THE first cut is made in 
the hollow part, in the direc- 
tion a to b, quite down to the 
bone : when the hollow part 
is allhelped away, some very 
delicate slices may be taken 
out of each side of the blade- 
bone, in the direction d to 
c. The best fat lies on 
the outer ridge, and is cut in thin slices in the direction g to 
f. There are two 
parts in the under 
side very full of gra- 
vy, and by many pre- 
ferred to the upper 
side. One is, by a 
deep cut in the line 
g h, accompanied 
with fat ; and the other 
all lean, in a line from, 
/to/t. 

Mutton Haun ch , 
Is carved like venison. 

Venison Haunch. 

CUT it across down to the 
bone, in the line a, b, c; and 
putting in the knife at b, cut 
in the line 6, d. The fat lies 
between d and a, and should 
be properly proportioned. 

Veal Fillet. 

MANY persons are fond of 
the outside slice of this joint, 
which should be cut thin and 
even from a to c ; at the same 
time help to a little of the fat 
and situfnng, which lies under 
b : to i nake the fillet look hand- 
some, a.11 the succeeding slices should be cut parallel with the 
first.

319 




Vtal Breast. 

DIVIDE the brisket from the ribs, and help a little of the 
sweetbread to either. 

Calf's Head. \ 

CUT slices from a to 
6, letting the knife go 
close to the bone ; the 
throat sweetbread lies 
in the fleshy part, at 
the neck end c, and 
slices should be helped 
from c to d with the 
other part. As the eye 
is reckoned a dainty, it should be neatly cut out with the point 
of the knife, and divided in two. On taking off the jaw- 
bone some fine lean will be found, and under the head is the 
palate, which is also highly liked. 

Pork Leg, 

Is carved exactly as the leg of mutton. 
Pork Sparerib. 

CUT slices out of the thick part .at the bottom of the 
bones, and when the fleshy parts are all done, separate and 
help the bones. 

Ham. 

HAM may be cut three 
ways : having cut off the 
hock at e, take thin cir- 
cular slices all round the 
bone to c, and afterwards 
carve it in the same man- 
ner as venison : or, cut 
down to the bone in the 
line a, b, and take thin slices each way : or, with the point of 
the knife cut a small round hole at c, and continue to cut it 
in thin circular slices. 



SEPARATE the shoul- 
der and leg in the 
line a, b, c t and di- 
vide the ribs, which 
are reckoned the finest 
part; although many 





320 



INSTRUCTIONS FOR CARVING. 




prefer the neck end, and even the legs : the ear and jaw are 
counted delicacies, and should also be offered, with plenty of 
sauce, and a spoonful of the force or stuffing. 

Lamb Fore-quarter. 

SEPARATE the shoulder from 
the breast and ribs, in the line 
a, A, c y d, without cutting too 
much meat from the bones ; 
, squeeze a little Seville orange 
or lemon, and sprinkle a little 
white pepper and salt : separate the gristly part of the ribs in 
the line e, c, and help from the part chosen. 

Hare, or Rabbit. 

PUT the point of the 
knife under the shoul- 
der at a, and cut all the 
way down to the rump 
in the line a, b ; do the 
same on the other side : 
cut the back into four, 
which, with the legs, 
are the parts most 
esteemed. Cat off the 
shoulder in the line c, d, a; and cut the head in two : help to 
the part approved, with a little stuffing and gravy to each. 

Goose. 

CUT off the apron in 
the line a, b, c, pour in 
the sauce (see Sauces}, 
and cut the breast in 
long slices in the line 

d, e; this will make the 

wings smaller, but more prime pieces may be thus taken : di- 
vide the wing b} 7 passing the knife through the joint at d, and 
the leg in the same manner at e: cut off the merry-thought 
at d,/, and having divided the pinions, cut off the neck bones, 
and separate the breast from the back : cut off the side-bits, 
or sidesmen, from the b;ck, and divide that into two parts. 
It requires much practice to carve a goose neatly, Help each 
person to a little of the seasoning and gravy- 





INSTRUCTIONS FOR CARVING. 



321 




Ducks, Teal, and Wild Fowl, 

ARE, in general, very nearly carved in the same manner as 
goose. 

Turkey. 

TAKE slices from the breast in the 
line from a to b, and proceed exactly 
in the same manner as above directed 
for goose, observing, that the parts 
nearest the wings are most delicate, 
and help a little of the liver, if ap- 
proved of, to each person. The giz- 
zard is generally devilled ; to do which, 
score it all over with the point of the knife, and having 
mixed up a spoonful of mustard, a little cayenne and salt, 
rub the composition over the whole, and send it out to be 
broiled. 

Fowl 

TAKE off the wing in the direction from 
to b; slip the knife between the body and 
leg, and turn it back with the fork: pro- 
ceed afterwards as already directed for 
carving goose. 

Pheasant. 

SLICE down the breast in the line a, b , 
take off the leg in the direction of the line 

b, d, and cut oft the wing in the line c d; se- 
parate the leg and wing on the other side, 
and cut off the slices of the breast ; cut off 
the merry-thought in the \inef, g, and 

proceed as above directed for goose. The prime parts are the 
breast, wings, and merry-thought, although the leg is of a 
higher flavour. 

Partridge 

Is carved in the same manner as a fowl ; 
the wings must be taken off in the lines 
a, b, and the merry-thought in the line 

c, b : the most esteemed parts are, the 
wings, breast, and merry-thought.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR CARVING. 




Pigeons 

MAY be either cut in halves from top to 
bottom, or across : the most approved way 
is to cut from the neck to tf, rather than 
from c to b, by a. 

Cod's Head. 

WITH the fish-knife or 
trowel, take off a piece 
quite down to the bone, in 
the direction a, b; c, d; 
putting in the trowel at <z, 
t 1 ; and with each slice of 
fish give a piece of the 

sound, which lies underneath the back-bone and lines it. The 
parts about the back-bone on the shoulders are the best; and 
about the head are many delicate parts, and a great deal of 
the jelly kind. 




Salmon. 



WITH the point of a 
sharp carving-knife, take 
slices in the direction of 
the lines a, b, and c, d; 
and with a fish-trowel 
serve slices of each part ; 
the back being more dry 
and firm than the belly, 
which is both fat and rich. 




Turbot. 



ENTER the fish-knife or trowel in the middle over the back- 
bone, and take off a piece of the fish, as much as will lie on 
the trowel, on one side close to the bones. The thickest part 
of the fish is always the most esteemed. 

Soles. 

THESE may be either boiled or fried. Cut them right through 
the middle, bone and all, and give a piece of the fish, in pro- 
portion to the size of it, to each person. 



INSTRUCTIONS FOR CARVING. 323 



Mackerel. 

SLIT this fish all along the back with a knife, and take off 
one whole side, not too near the head, because the meat about 
the gills is generally black and ill-flavoured. 

Eels. 

CUT these into pieces quite through the bone. The thickest 
part is the most esteemed. 

Besides these, there are many other little articles brought 
to table ; but as they are mostly simple in their nature, a little 
observation and practice will make complete proficients in the 
art of carving,

MADE WINES, CORDIAL WATERS, AND 
MALT LIQUORS. 



CHAPTER I. 



MADE WINES. 

PRELIMINARY HINTS AND OBSERVATIONS. 

(TREAT care and precaution are necessary in the making 
wine, as it is frequently spoiled by mismanagement. If you 
let your wine stand too long before you get it cold, and do 
not take great care to put your barin upon it in time, it will 
make it fret in the cask, and you will find it very difficult, if 
at all possible, to bring it to any degree of fineness. On the 
other hand, if you let your wine work too long in the tub, 
it will take off all the sweetness and flavour of the fruit or 
flowers your wine is made from. Be careful to have your 
vessels dry, and rinsed with brandy; and as soon as the wine is 
done fermenting, to close them up properly. 

Blackberry Wine. 

HAVING procured berries that are full ripe, put them into a 
large vessel of wood or stone, with a cock in it, and pour upon 
them as much boiling water as will cover them. As soon as 
the heat will permit the hand to be put into the vessel, bruise 
them well till all the berries are broken. Then let them stand 
covered till the berries begin to rise towards the top, which 
they usually do in three, or four days. Draw off the clear into 
another vessel, and add to every ten quarts of this liquor one 
pound of sugar. Stir it well in, and let it stand to work a 
week or ten days, in another vessel like the first. Then draw 
it off at the cock through a jelly-bag into a large vessel. Take 
four ounces of isinglass, and lay it to steep twelve hours in a 
pint of white wine. The next morning boil it up on a slow fire 
till it is all dissolved. Then take a gallon of blackberry juice, 
put in the dissolved isinglass, give them a boil together, and 



MADE WINES. . 325 

pour all into the vessel. Let it stand a few days to purge and 
settle, then draw it off, and keep it in a cool place. 

Gooseberry Wine. 

GOOSEBERRIES for this purpose must be gathered in dry 
weather, and when they are only half ripe. Pick and bruise a 
peck of them in a tub ; then take a horse-hair cloth, and press 
them as much as possible without breaking the seeds. Hav- 
ing pressed out all the juice, to every gallon of gooseberries 
put three pounds of fine dry powdered sugar. Stir all toge- 
ther till the sugar is dissolved, and then put it into a vessel 
or cask, which must be quite filled. If it be ten or twelve 
gallons, let it stand a fortnight; but if a twenty gallon cask, 
it must stand three weeks. Set it in a cool place, then draw it 
off from the lees, and pour in the clear liquor again. If a 
ten gallon cask, let it stand three months; if a twenty gallon 
cask, four months, and then bottle it off. 

Pearl Gooseberry Wine. 

TAKE the best pearl gooseberries, bruise them, and let them 
stand all night ; the next morning press or squeeze them out, 
and let the liquor stand to settle seven or eight hours: then 
pour off the clear from the settling, and measure it as it is 
put into the vessel, adding to every three pints of liquor a 
pound of double-refined sugar. Break the sugar in small 
lumps, and put it into the vessel, with a piece of isinglass. 
Stir it up, and at three months end bottle it, putting a lump 
of double-refined sugar into every bottle. 

Damson Wine. 

GATHER the damsons on a dry day, weigh them, and then 
bruise them ; put them into a steen that has a cock in it, 
and to every eight pounds of fruit put a gallon of water. 
Boil the water, skim it, and put it scalding hot to the fruit. 
Let it stand two days, then draw it off, and put it into a ves- 
sel, and to every gallon of liquor put two pounds and a half 
of fine sugar : fill up the vessel, and stop it close, and the 
longer it stands the better. Keep it twelve months in the ves- 
sel, and then bottle it, putting a lump of sugar into every 
bottle. The small damson is the best for this purpose. 

Orange Wine. 

TAKE six gallons of spring water, and boil it three quarters 
of an hour, with twelve pounds of the best powder sugar, 
and the whites of eight or ten eggs well beaten. When it is 



326 MADE WINES. 

cold, put into it six spoonfuls of yeast. Take the juice of 
twelve lemons, which being pared, must stand with two pounds 
of white sugnr in a proper vessel, and in the morning skim off 
the top, and put it into the water. Then add the juice and rinds 
of fifty oranges, but not the white parts of the rinds, and 
then let them work all together for forty-eight hours. Then 
add two quarts of the Rhenish or white wine, and put it into 
the vessel. 

Or, take thirty pounds of new Malaga raisins, picked clean ; 
chop them small, and take twenty l.ir^e Seville oranges, ten 
of which pare as thin as for preserving. Boil about eight 
gallons of soft water till one third. of it is wasted, and let it 
cool a little. Then put five gallons of it hot upon the raisins 
and orange-peel, stir it well together, cover it up, and when 
it is cold, let it stand five days, stirring it once or twice 
a day. Then pass it through a hair sieve, and Avith a spoon 
press it as dry as possible. Put it in a rundlet fit for it, and 
put to it the rinds of the other ten oranges, cut as thin as the 
first. Then make a syrup of the juice of twenty oranges, 
with a pound of white sugar. It must be made the day be- 
fore it is tunned up. Stir it well together, and stop it close ; 
let it stand two months to clear, and then bottle it up. It will 
be better at the end of the third year than at the first. 

Lemon Wine. 

PARE off the rinds of six large lemons, cut them, and 
squeeze out the juice, steep the rinds in the juice, and put 
to it -a quart of brandy : let it stand three days in an earthen 
pot close stopped ; then squeeze six more, and mix it with 
two quarts of spring water, and as much sugar as will sweeten 
the whole. Boil the water, lemons, and sugar together, and 
let it stand till it be cool. Then add a quart of white wine, 
and the other lemons and brandy, then mix them together, 
and run it through a flannel bag into some vessel. Let it 
stand three months, and then bottle it off. Cork the bottles 
well, keep it cool, and it will be fit to drink in a month or 
six weeks. 

Or, pare five dozen of lemons very thin, put the peels into 
five quarts of French brandy, and let them stand fourteen 
days. Then make the juice into a syrup with three pounds of 
single-refined sugar, and when the peels are ready, boil fif- 
teen gallons of water, with forty pounds of single-refined su- 
gar, tor half an hour. Then put it into a tab, and when cool, 
add to it one spoonful of barm, and let it work two days. 
Then tun it, and put in the brandy, peels, and syrup. Stir 
them all together, and close up the cask. Let it stand three 



MADE WINES. 321 

months, then botile it, and it will be as pale and as fine as any 
citron water. 

Currant Wine. 

LET the currants be full I'ipe, and gathered on a dry day; 
strip them, put them into a large, pan, and bruise them with a 
wooden pestle ; let them stand in a tub or pan twenty-four 
hours to ferment, then run it through a hair-sieve, and do not 
let the hand touch the liquor. To every gallon of this liquor 
put two pounds and a half of white sugar, stir it well toge- 
ther, and put it into the vessel. To e.very six gallons put in 
a quart of brandy, and let it stand six weeks. If it is then 
fine, bottle it ; but if not, draw it off as clear as possible into 
another vessel or large bottles, and in a fortnight put it into 
smaller bottles. 

Raisin Wine. 

PUT two hundredweight of raisins, stalks and all, into a 
large hogshead, and fill it with water. Let them steep a fort- 
night, stirring them every clay; then pour off the liquor, and 
press the raisins. Put both liquors together into a nice clean 
vessel that will just hold it, for it must be full. Let it stand 
till it has done hissing, or making the least noise; then stop 
it close, and let it stand six months. Peg it, and if not quite 
clear, rack it off in another vessel. Stop it again close, and 
let it stand three months longer. Then bottle it, and when 
used, rack it off into a decanter. 

Grape Wine. 

To a gallon of grapes put a gallon of water. Bruise the 
grapes, let them stand a week without stirring, and then draw 
it off fine. Put to a gallon of the wine three pounds of sugar, 
and then put it into a vessel, but do not stop it till it has 
done hissing. 

Cherry Wine. 

When cherries are full ripe, pull them off the stalks, and 
press them through a hair-sieve. To every gallon of liquor 
put two pounds of lump sugar finely beaten, then stir it to- 
gether, and put it into a vessel, which must be filled. When 
ft has done working, and ceases to make any noise, stop it 
close for three months, and bottle it off. 

Raspberry Wine. 

WITH the back of a spoon bruise the finest raspberries, 
strain them through a flannel bag into a stone jar. To 



328 MADE WINES. 

each quart of juice put a pound of double-refined sugar, then 
stir it well together, and cover it close. Let it stand three 
days, and pour it off clear. To a quart of juice put two 
quarts of white wine, and bottle it off. It will be fit for 
drinking in about a week. 

Apricot Wine. 

TAKE three pounds of sugar, and three quarts of water ; let 
them boil together, and skim it well. Then put in six 
pounds of apricots pared and stoned, and let them boil till 
they are tender. Take them up, and when the liquor is cold 
bottle it up. Or, after the apricots are taken out, let the 
liquor have a boil with a sprig of flowered clary in it. The 
apricots will make marmalade, and be very good for present 
use. 

Plum Wine. 

TAKE twenty pounds of Malaga raisins, pick, rub, and 
shred them, and put them into a tub; then take four gallons 
of water, boil it an hour, and let it stand till milk-warm. Put 
in the raisins, and let it stand nine or ten days, stirring it 
once or twice each day. Strain out the liquor, and mix it 
with two quarts of damson juice. Put it into a vessel, and 
when it has done working, stop it up close. Let it stand 
four or five months, and then bottle it. 

Mulberry Wine. 

GATHER mulberries when they are just changed from their 
redness to a shining black, and be sure to gather them on a 
dry day, when the sun has taken off the dew. Spread them 
thinly on a fine cloth on a floor or table for twenty-four hours. 
Boil up a gallon of water to each gallon of juice gotten out 
of them ; then skim the water well, and add a little cinnamon 
slightly bruised. Put to each gallon six ounces of white su- 
gar-candy finely beaten ; then skim and strain the water, when 
it has been taken off and has settled, and put it to the juice 
of some more mulberries. To every gallon of the liquor add 
a pint of white wine or Rhenish vrine. Let it stand in a cask 
to purge or settle for five or six days, and then draw off the 
wine and keep it cool. 

Walnut Wine. 

PUT two pounds of brown sugar and a pound of honey to 
every gallon, of water; boil them half an hour, and take off 
the scum. Put into the tub a handful of walnut leaves to 



MADE WINES. 329 

every gallon, and pour the liquor upon them. Let it stand 
all night, then take out the leaves, and put in half a pint of 
yeast. Let it work fourteen days, and beat it four or five 
times a day, which will take off the sweetness. Then stop 
up the cask, and let it stand six months. 

Quince Wine. 

TAKE twenty large quinces, gathered when they are dry 
and full ripe. Wipe them clean with a coarse cloth, and 
grate them with a large grater or rasp as near the cores as pos- 
sible ; but do not touch the cores. Boil a gallon of spring 
water, throw in the quinces, and let them boil softly about a 
quarter of an hour. Then strain them well into an earthen 
pan on two pounds of double-refined sugar. Pare the peel 
off two large lemons, throw them in, and squeeze the juice 
through a sieve. Stir it about till it is very cool, and then 
toast a thin bit of bread very brown, rub a little yeast on it, 
and let the whole stand close covered twenty-four hours. Take 
out the toast and lemon, put the wine in a cask, keep it three 
months and bottle it. If a twenty gallon cask, let it stand 
six months before bottling it ; and remember, when straining 
the quinces, to wring them hard in a coarse cloth. 

Clary Wine. 

TAKE twenty-four pounds of Malaga raisins, pick them 
and chop them very small ; put them into a tub, and to each 
pound put a quart of water : let them steep ten or eleven 
days, stirring it twice every day, and mind to keep it covered. 
Then strain it off, and put it into a vessel, with about half a 
peck of the tops of clary, when it is in blossom. Stop it 
close for six weeks, and then bottle it off. In two or three 
months it will be fit to drink. As it is apt to have a great se- 
diment at bottom, it will be best to draw it off by plugs, or 
rap it pretty high. 

Birch Wine. 

THE beginning of March is the season for procuring the li- 
quor from the birch trees, while the sap is rising, and before 
the leaves shoot out ; for when the sap is come forward, and 
the leaves appear, the juice, by being long digested in the 
bark, grows thick and coloured, which before was thin and 
clear. The method of procuring the juice is, by boring holes 
in the body of the tree, and putting in fossets, which are 
usually made of the branches of elder, the pith being taken 
out. Yon may, without hurting the tree, if it be large, tap 
it in several places, four or five at a time, and by that mean* 



330 MADE WINES. 

save, from a good many trees, several gallons every day. If 
you do not get enough in one day, the bottles in which it 
drops must be corked clo.->e, and rosined or waxed ; however, 
make use of it as soon as you can, Take the sap, and boil it 
as long as any scum will rise, skimming it all tiie time. To 
every gallon of liquor put four pounds of good sugar, and 
the thin peel of a lemon. Then boil it half an hour, and keep 
skimming it well. Pour it into a clean tub, and when it is 
almost cold, set it to work with yeast spread upon a toast. 
Let it stand five or six days, stirring it often. Then take a 
cask just large enough to hold all the liquor, fire a large 
match dipped in brimstone, and throw it into the cask. Stop 
it close till the match is extinguished, then tun the wine, lay 
the bung on lightly till it has done working, then stop it close, 
and after three months bottle it. 

Or, to a hogshead of birch water take four hundred of Ma- 
laga raisins ; pick them clean from the stalks, and cut them 
small. Then boil the birch liquor for one hour at least, skim 
it well, and let it stand till no warmer than milk. Then put in 
the raisins, and let it stand close covered, stirring it well four 
or five times every day. Boil all the stalks in a gallon or 
two of birch liquor, which, when added to the other when 
almost cold, will give it an agreeable roughness. Let it stand 
ten days, then put it in a cool cellar, and when it has done 
hissing in the vessel, stop it up close. It must stand at least 
nine months before it is bottled. 

Cowslip Wine. 

TAKE twelve pounds of sugar, the juice of six lemons, the 
whites of four eggs well beaten, and six gallons of water. 
Put all together in a kettle, and let it boil half an hour, taking 
care to skim it well. Take a peck -of cowslips, and put them 
into a tub, with the thin peeling of six lemons. Then pour 
on thfe'boiling liquor, and stir them about, and when it is al- 
most cold, put in a thin toast, baked hard, and rubbed with 
yeast. Let it stand two or three days to work. Six ounces 
of syrup of citron or lemon, with a quart of Rhenish wine, 
added before tunning, will be a great improvement. The 
third day strain it off, and squeeze the cowslips through a 
coarse cloth. Then strain it through a flannel bag, and tun 
it up. Leave the bung loose for two or three days till it has 
done working, and then bung it down tight. Let it stand three 
months and bottle it. 

Turnip Wine. 

TAKE turnips, pare and slice them, put them into a cyder 
press, and press out all the juice; to every gallon of juice 



MADE WINES. 331 

put three pounds of lump sugar, put both into a vessel just 
big enough to hold them, and add to every gallon of juice 
half a pint of brandy. Lay some thing over the bung for a 
week, and when it has done working, bung it down close. 
When it has stood three months, draw it off into another 
vessel, and when fine, put it into bottles. 

Elder Wine. 

GATHER elder berries when ripe, put them into a stone jar, 
or set them in the oven, or in a kettle of boiling water, till the 
jar is hot enough. Then take them out, and strain' them 
through a hair cloth, wringing the berries, and put the juice 
into a clean kettle. To every quart of juice put a pound of 
fine Lisbon sugar, then let it boil, and skim it well. When it 
is clear and fine, pour it into a jar, and when cold, cover it 
close, and keep it till you make raisin wine. When you tun 
the raisin wine, to every gallon put half a pint of the elder 
syrup. This is more properly called elder raisin wine. 

Or, take the flowers of elder, and take care not to let any 
stalks in ; to every quart of flowers put one gallon of water, 
and three pounds of loaf sugar. Boil the water and sugar a 
quarter of an^hour, tlien pour it on the flowers, and let it work 
three days. Then strain the wine through a hair sieve, and 
put it into a cask. To every ten gallons of wine add an ounce 
of isinglass dissolved in cyder, and six whole eggs. Close it 
up, let it stand six months, and then bottle it. 

Rose Wine. 

TAKE a well-glazed earthen vessel, and put into it three 
gallons of rose water drawn with a cold still. Put into that a 
sufficient quantity of rose leaves, cover it close, and set it for 
an liour in a kettle or copper of hot water, to take out the 
whole strength and tincture of the roses ; and when it. hs cold, 
press the rose leaves hard into the liquor; and steep fresh 
ones in it, repeating it till the liquor has got the full strength 
of the roses. To every gallon of liquor put three pounds of 
loaf sugar, and stir it well, that it may melt and disperse in 
every part. Then put it into a cask or other convenient ves- 
sel, to ferment, and put into it a piece of bread toasted hard 
and covered with yeast. Let it stand about thirty clays, when 
it will be ripe, and have a fine flavour, having the whole 
strength and scent of the roses in it; and may be greatly im- 
proved, by adding to it wine and spices. By this method of 
infusion, wine of carnations, clove gilliflower, violets, prim- 
roses, or any other flower, having a curious scent, may be 
made. 



332 MADE WINES. 

Barley Wine. 

BOIL half a pound of French barley in three waters, and 
save three pints of the last water. Mix it with a quart of 
white wine, half a pint of borage water, as much clary water, 
a little red rose water, the juice of five or six lemons, three 
quarters of a pound of fine sugar, and the thin yellow rind of 
a lemon. Mix all these well together, run it through a strainer, 
and bottle it up. It is pleasant in hot weather, and is very good 
in fevers. 

English Fig Wine. 

TAKE the large blue figs, when pretty ripe, and steep them 
in white wine, having made some slits in them, that they may 
swell and gather in the substance of the wine : then slice some 
other figs, and let them simmer over a fire in water till re- 
duced to a kind of pulp. Strain out the water, pressing the 
pulp hard, and pour it as hot as possible on the figs that are 
imbrued in the wine. Let the quantities be nearly equal, but 
the water somewhat more than the wine and figs. Let them 
stand twenty-four hours, mash them well together, and draw 
off what will run without squeezing. Then press the rest, and 
if not sweet enough, add a sufficient quantity of sugar, to 
make it so. Let it ferment, and add a little honey and sugar- 
candy to it ; then fine it with whites of eggs and a little isin- 
glass, and draw it off for use. 

O ' 

Ginger Wine. 

BOIL seven pounds of Lisbon sugar in four gallons of spring 
water for a quarter of an hour, and skim it well. When the 
liquor is cold, squeeze in the juice of two lemons, and then 
boil the peels, with two ounces of ginger, in three pints of 
water for an hour. When cold, put it all together into a bar- 
rel, with two spoonsful of yeast, a quarter of an ounce of isin- 
glass beat very thin, and two pounds of jar raisins. Then 
close it up, let it stand seven weeks, and bottle it. The spring 
is the best season for making it. 

Sycamore Wine. 

BOIL two gallons of the sap half an hour, and then add to 
it four pounds of fine powdered sugar. Beat the whites of 
three eggs to a froth, and mix them with the liquor; but take 
care that it is not too hot, as that will poach the eggs. Skim 
it well, and boil it half an hour. Then strain it through a 
hair sieve, and let it stand till next day. Pour it clean from the 



MADE WINES. 333 

sediment, put half a pint of yeast to every twelve gallons, and 
cover it close up with blankets. Then put it into the barrel, 
and leave the bung hole open till it has done working. Close 
it up well, and after it has stood three months, bottle it. The 
fifth part of the sugar must be loaf : and raisins will be a great 
improvement to the wine. 

Sack Mead (Vine. 

To every gallon of water put four pounds of honey, and 
boil it three quarters of an hour, taking care properly to skim 
it. To each gallon add half an ounce of hops, then boil it 
half an hour, and let it stand till the next day. Put it into a 
cask, and to thirteen gallons of the above liquor add a quart of 
brandy or sack. Let it be lightly closed till the fermentation 
is done, and stop it up very close. If a large cask, do not 
bottle it till it has stood a year. 

Walnut Mead. 

To every gallon of water put three pounds and a half of 
honey, and boil them together three quarters of an hour. To 
every gallon of liquor put about two dozen of walnut leaves, 
pour the liquor boiling hot upon them, and let them stand all 
night : take out the leaves, put in a spoonful of yeast, and let 
it work two or three days. Then make it up, and after it has 
stood three months, bottle it. 

Cowslip Mead. 

To fifteen gallons of water put thirty pounds of honey, and 
boil it till one gallon is wasted. Skim it, take it off" the fire, 
and have ready sixteen lemons cut in halves. Take a gallon 
of the liquor, and put it to the lemons. Put the rest of the 
liquor into a tub, with seven pecks of cowslips, and let them 
stand all night. Put in the liquor with the lemons, eight 
spoonsful of new yeast, and a handful of sweetbriar ; stir them 
all well together, and let it work three or four days. Then 
strain it, put it into a cask, and after k it has stood six months, 
bottle it. 

Mead Wine. 

To one hundred and twenty gallons of pure water, the softer 
the better, put fifteen gallons of clarified honey. When the 
honey is well mixed with the water, fill a copper, which holds 
only sixty gallons, and boil it till it is reduced about a fourth 
part. Draw it off, and boil the remainder of the liquor in the 
same manner. When this last is about a fourth part wasted, 



$34- MADE WINES. 

fill up the copper with some of that which was first boiled, 
and continue boiling it and filling it up, till the copper con- 
tains the whole of the liquor, by which time it will of course 
be half evaporated. In boiling, never take off the scum, but, 
on the contrary, have it well mixed with the liquor whilst 
boiling, by means of a jet. When this is done, draw it off 
into under backs, by a cock at the bottom of the copper, in 
which let it remain till only as warm as new milk. At this 
time tun it up, and suffer it to ferment in the vessel, where 
it will form a thick head. As soon as it is done working, stop 
it down very close, in order to keep the air from it as much 
as possible. Keep this in a cool cellar, so as not to be at all 
affected by the change of weather. 

Or, take eighty pounds of purified honey to one hundred 
and twenty gallons of soft water, and manage in the making, 
in all respects, like the first above mentioned, it proves very 
pleasant, good, light drinking, and is by many preferred to 
the other, which is much richer, and has a fuller flavour, 
but at the same time it is more inebriating. Many like mead 
when it has an aromatic flavour , and for this purpose they mix 
elder, rosemary, and marjoram flowers with it ; and also use 
cinnamon, cloves, ginger, and cardamums, in various propor- 
tions, according to their taste. Others put in a mixture of 
thyme, eglantine, marjoram, and rosemary, with various 
spices ; but green herbs are apt to make mead drink flat ; and 
too many cloves, besides being very predominant in the taste, 
make it of too high a colour. Never bottle mead before it is 
half a year old ; and take care to have it well corked, and 
keep it in the same vault wherein it stood whilst in the cask. 

Balm Wine. 

TAKE forty pounds of sugar and nine gallons of water, boil 
it gently for two hours, skim it well, and put it into a tub to 
cool ; take two pounds and a half of the tops of balm, bruise 
them, and put them into a barrel with a little new yeast ; and 
when the liquor is cold, pour it on the balm. Stir it well to- 
gether, and let it stand twenty-four hours, stirring it often. 
Then close it up, and let it stand six weeks. Rack it off, and 
put a lump of sugar into every bottle. Cork it well, and it 
will be better the second year than the first. 

Mountain Wine. 

PICK out the large stalk of Malaga raisins, chop them very 
small, and put five pounds of them to every gallon of cold 
spring water. Let them steep a fortnight or more, then 



MADE WINES. 33 

squeeze out the liquor, and put it into a small vessel that will 
just hold it; but first fume it with brimstone. Do not stop it 
up till the hissing is over. 

Cyprus Wine. 

To nine gallons of water, put nine quarts of the jiffce of 
the white elder berries, which have been pressed gently from 
the berries with the hand, and passed through a sieve with- 
out bruising the kernels of the berries. Add to every gallon 
of liquor three pounds of Lisbon sugar, and to the whole 
quantity put an ounce and a. half of ginger sliced, and three 
quarters of an ounce of cloves. Then boil all near an hour, 
taking off the scum as it rises, and pour the whole to cool in an 
open tub, and work it with ale yeast spread upon a toast of 
white bread for three days ; then turn it into a vessel that will 
just hold it, adding about a pound and a half of raisins of the 
sun split, to lie in the liquor till drawn off, which should not be 
till the wine is fine. 

Frontiniac Wine. 

TAKE twelve pounds of white sugar, six pounds of raisins 
of the sun cut small, and six gallons of water, and let them 
boil an hour. Then take half a peck of the flowers of elder, 
when they are falling, and will shake off. Put them in the li- 
quor when it is almost cold, and the next day put in six 
spoonsful of the syrup of lemons, and four spoonsful of ale 
yeast. Two days afterwards put it into a vessel that will just 
hold it, and when it has stood two months, bottle it off. 

English Champaign,, 

To three gallons of water put nine pounds of Lisbon Sugar, 
and boil the water and sugar half an hour, observing to skim 
it well. Then take a gallon of white currants picked, but not 
bruised, and pour the liquor boiling hot over them. When 
nearly cold, put into it some barm, keep working it for two 
days, and then strain it through a rlannel or sieve. Put it 
into a barrel that will just hold it, with half an ounce of isin- 
glass well bruised. When it has done working, stop it close 
for a month, then bottle ic, and in every bottle put a very small 
lump of double-refined sugar. 

Saragossa Wine, or English Sack. 

PUT a sprit; of rue into every quart of water, and to every 
gallon put a handful of fennel roots. Boil these half an hour, 
then strain it, and to every gallon of liquor put three pounds 



336 MADE WINES. 

of hopey. Boil it two hours, and skim it well. When cold, 
pour it off, and turn it into a cask or vessel that will just hold 
it. Keep it a year in the vessel, and then bottle it. 

Palermo Wine. 

To every quart of water put a pound of Malaga raisins, rub 
and cut them small, and put them into the water; let them 
stand ten days, stirring them once or twice every day. Boil 
the water an hour before putting it to the raisins, and let it 
stand to cool. At (en days' end strain out the liquor, and put 
a little yeast to it. At the end of three days put it into the 
vessel, with a sprig of dried wormwood. Let it be stopped 
close, and at the end of three months, bottle it. 

Vino Pontificate. 

STEEP the zest rinds of six oranges and six lemons twenty- 
four hours in a gallon of good brandy, close stopped ; boil a 
pound and a half of loaf sugar in two gallons of water a quar- 
ter of an hour, and clarify it with the whites of ten eggs. 
When cold, add the juice of twenty-four oranges and five 
lemons to the gallon of brandy. Then mix all together, and 
strain off the rinds. Put the liquor into a cask well stopped, 
and after six weeks draw it into bottles, when it will be fit for 
use ; but will grow the better for keeping. 

Raspberry Brandy. 

TAKE a pint of water and two quarts of brandy, and put 
them into a pitcher large enough to hold them and four pints 
of raspberries. Put in half a pound of loaf sugar, and let it re- 
main for a week close covered. Then take a piece of flannel, 
with a piece of Holland over it, and let it run through by 
degrees. It may be racked into other bottles a week after, 
and then it will be perfectly fine. 

Black Cherry Brandy. 

STONE eight pounds of black cherries, and put on them a 
gallon of the best brandy ; bruise the stones in a mortar, and 
put them into the brandy ; cover them up close, and let them 
stand a month or six weeks. Then pour it clear from the se- 
diments, and bottle it. Morello cherries, managed in this 
manner, make a fine rich cordial. 

Lemon Brandy. 

PUT five quarts of'water to one gallon of brandy, take two 
dozen of lemons, two pounds of the best s\igar, and three 



MADE WINES. 331 

pints of milk ; pare the lemons very thin, and lay the peel to 
steep in the brandy twelve hours. Squeeze the lemons upon 
the sugar, then put the water to it, and mix ail the ingredients 
together. Boil the milk, and pour it in boiling hot. Let it 
stand twenty-four hours, and strain it. 

Orange Brandy. 

PUT the chips of eighteen Seville oranges in three quarts 
of brandy, and let them steep a fortnight in a stone bottle 
close stopped : boil two quarts of spring water with a pound 
and a half of the finest sugar, near an hour very gently. Cla- 
rify the water and sugar with the white of an egg, then strain 
it through a jelly-bag, and boil it near half way. When it is 
cold, strain the brandy into the syrup. 

White Currant Shrub. 

HAVING stripped the fruit, prepare in ajar as for jelly : piu 
one gallon of rum, and two pounds of lump sugar to two quarts 
of the strained juice, and strain through a jelly-bag till clear: 
bottle for use. 

Norfolk Punch. 

HAVING pared six lemons and three Seville oranges very 
thin; squeeze the juice into an earthen pan, and add to it a 
quart of white wine, a pound and a quarter of sugar, two 
quarts of brandy, and one quart of milk : mix well together, 
and cover close for twenty-four hours ; then strain through a 
jelly-bag till clear, and bottle. 

Milk Punch. 

TAKE two pounds of sugar, an.l rub it upon six oranges 
and six. lemons, in order to extract the essence; put the sugar 
into four quarts of water : pare the oranges and lemons very 
thin, putting the parings to steep in a bottle of rum or brandy 
for twenty-four hours : squeeze the fruit on the sugar and 
water, and add a quart of new milk boiling hot; mix well to- 
gether, and add the parings and spirit : strain the whole 
through a jelly-bag till clear, and bottle for use. 

Noyau English. 

BLANCH and bruise a quarter of a pound of peach ajid 
apricot kernels; or, for want of these, a quarter of a pound of 
bitter almonds,; put them into a pint of cold water, and let 
dtiem stand tw"b hours; then add three pints of the juice ef 

Z 



338 MADE 'WINES. 

white currants, three pounds of fine loaf sugar, the peels of 
three lemons grated, and a gallon of brandy: stir well toge- 
ther, letting all stand three days, then strain through a jelly- 
bag, and bottle. Take the residue left in the bag, and pour 
on it a quart of brandy, and let stand for three days ; strain 
through a jelly-bag, and keep for flavouring custards, cakes 3 &c. 

Liqueur au Citron. 

HAVING pared eight large lemons, cut them and squeeze 
out the juice ; steep the rinds in the juice, and add to it a quart 
of brandy, and let it stand in a stone jar closely covered for 
three days : squeeze eight more lemons, and mix with them 
five pints of spring water, and five pounds of sugar; boil 
these all together, skim clean, and let them stand till cool, 
and add a quart of white wine, and the other lemon juice and 
brandy, mix well together, run through a jelly -bag into a 
cask, and after standing three months, bottle off, and keep in 
a cool place. 

Malt Spirits 

MAY be freed from their nauseous flavour, and rendered fit 
for making liqueurs and other compounds, by the following 
mode : to every quart of English brandy add three ounces 
and a half of fresh-burnt charcoal reduced to powder, shake 
well together, and keep in a bottle closely stopped for two 
days: decant by means of a syphon, or strain through blot- 
ting paper. 

Or, in Distillation, tie to the nose of the worm a flannel 
bag, containing two ounces of powdered charcoal for every 
quart of spirit intended to be distilled, and let the spirit run 
through the bag. 



MAY be freed from its disagreeable flavour, and rendered 
fit to use instead of sugar, in many cases, by the following 
mode: take twenty-four pounds of treacle, twenty-four pounds 
of water, and six pounds of charcoal coarsely powdered ; mix 
together in a kettle, and boil the whole over a slow wood fire : 
after boiling half an hour, pour it into a flat vessel, in order 
that the charcoal may subside to the bottom ; draw off the 
liquid by a syphon, or pour it off without disturbing the 
charcoal : put it into a clean kettle, set over a slow fire, and 
evaporate till of the former consistence. Twenty -four pounds 
of treacle will thus produce an equal weight of pure syrup, 
fit for most domestic purposes where sugar is intended to be 
used. 



CORDIAL WATERS 339 



CHAPTER II, 
CORDIAL WATERS. 

PRELIMINARY HINTS AND OBSERVATIONS. 

WHEN your still is a limbec, fill the top with cold water 
when you set it on, make a little paste of flour and water, 
and close the bottom of the still well with it. Take great care 
that your fire be not so hot as to make it boil over, as that 
will weaken the strength of the water. You must frequently 
change your water on the top of your still, and never let it be 
scalding hot, for your still will drop gradually off. If you 
use a hot Still, when you put on the top, dip a cloth in white 
lead and oil, and lay it well over the edges of your still, and a 
coarse wet cloth over tHe top. It will require little fire under 
it ; but you must be sure to keep it very clear. When your 
cloth is dry, dip it in cold water, and lay it on again ; and if 
your still be very hot, wet another cloth, and lay it round 
the top. If you use a worm-still, keep the wnter in your 
tub full to the top, and change it often, to prevent its growing 
hot. All simple waters must stand two or three days before 
you work it, in order to take off the fiery taste which the still 
gives it. 

Parfetto Amore. 

, INFUSE in a gallon of best brandy the rind, pared thin, of six 
large fresh lemons cut in small pieces; five cloves, five co- 
riander seeds, a handful of currants, a little cinnamon, and a 
little salt ; let them remain in steep twelve hours ; put toge- 
ther into the still, and draw off two quarts. Take two pounds 
of lump sugar, boiled and clarified in two quarts of water 
with three eggs ; take also a little alum and cream of tartar, 
mix together with a little boiling water, and rub well down in 
a marble mortar; strain through a sieve, and add to the cla- 
rified syrup: mix the distilled spirit with the whole, and filter 
through blotting paper. 

Pcrsico. 

INFUSE in a gallon of the best brandy, six ounces of bitter 
almonds beaten in a mortar, two cloves, half an ounce of cin- 
namon, and a little salt ; let them steep twenty-four hours '- 
z 2 



34O CORDIAL WATERS. 

put into a still, and draw off two quarts ; boil two pounds of 
lump sugar in two quarts of water, skimming it, and when 
cool, add it to the spirit. 

Cornelia. 

INFUSE in a gallon of best brandy four ounces of best cin- 
namon, thirteen coriander seeds, thirty cloves, and a little 
salt, for eighteen hours: put into a still, and draw off till the 
faints rise. Take two pounds of lump sugar, boiled and cla- 
rified in five pints of water, with three whites of eggs well 
beaten : mix with the spirit, and filter through blotting 
paper. 

Geroufle 

Is made with cloves instead of cinnamon, adding one ounce 
of best cinnamon to it, 

Anniseed 
Is made like cloves, adding cinnamon to the palate. 

Coffee and Chocolate 

ARE made by taking one pound of either, infusing in a 
gallon of best brandy, with four cloves, and half an ounce of 
cinnamon : draw off two quarts, and sweeten to the palate. 

Cordial Water. 

TAKE wormwood, horebound, feverfew, and lavender cot- 
ton, of each three handsful ; rue, peppermint, and Seville 
orange peel, of each a handful. Steep them in red wine, or 
the bottoms of strong beer, all night. Then distil them 
pretty quick in a hot still, and it will be a fine cordial to take 
as bitters. 

Angelica Water. 

TAKE eight handfuls of the leaves of angelica, wash and 
cut them, and lay them on a table to dry. When dry put 
them into an earthen pot, and put to them four quarts of 
strong wine lees. Let it infuse twenty-four hours, but stir it 
twice in the time. Then put it into a warm still or an alembic, 
and draw it off. Cover the bottles with a paper, and prick 
holes in it, and let it stand two or three days. Then mix all 
together, sweeten it, and when it is settled, bottle it up, and 
stop it close. 



CORDIAL WATERS. 341 



Peppermint Water. 

PEPPERMINT must be gathered when it is full grown, and be.- 
fore it seeds. Cut it in short lengths, fill the still with it, and 
cover it with water. Then make a good fire under it, and 
when it is near boiling, and the still begins to drop, if the fire 
is too hot, draw a little from under it, to keep it from boiling 
over, or the water Avill be muddy. The slower the still drops, 
the clearer and stronger will be the water; but do not spend 
it too far. The next day bottle it, and let it stand three or 
four days, to take off the fiery taste of the still. Then cork it 
well, and it will keep a long time. 

Milk Water. 

TAKE the herbs agrimony, endive, fumitory, balm, elder 
flowers, white nettles, water cresses, bank cresses, and sage, 
of each three handsful; eyebright, brooklime, and celandine, 
of each two handsful; the roses of yellow dock, red madder, 
fennel, horse-radish, and liquorice, of each three ounces ; 
stoned raisins one pound; nutmeg sliced, winter bark, tur- 
meric, and galangal,of each two drachms ; carroway and fennel 
seeds, of each three ounces, and one gallon of milk. Distil 
all with a gentle fire in one day. 

Rose Water. 

GATHER red roses when they are dry and full blown ; pick 
off the leaves, and to every peck put a quart of water. Then 
put them into a cold still, and make a slow fire under it ; for 
the slower it is distilled, the better it will be. Then bottle it, 
and in two or three days' time cork it. 

Cordial Poppy Water. 

TAKE a peck of poppies, and two gallons of very good 
brandy. Put them together in a wide-mouthed glass, let them 
stand forty-eight hours, and then strain them out. Stone a 
pound of raisins of the sun, and take an ounce of coriander 
seeds, an ounce of sweet fennel seeds, and an ounce of li- 
quorice sliced. Bruise them all together, and put them into 
the brandy, with a pound of good powder sugar. Let them 
stand four or eight weeks, shaking them every day ; then 
strain it off, and bottle it up close. 

Penny-Royal Water. 

GATHER penny-royal when it is full grown, and before it is 
in blossom. Then fill the cold still with it, and put it half 



342 CORDIAL WATERS, 

full of water. Make a moderate fire under it, and distil it oft' 
cold. Then put it into bottles, and, after two or three days, 
cork it up close. 

Treacle Water. 

TAKE four pounds of the juice of green walnuts; rue, car- 
duus, marigolds, and balm, of each three pounds; roots of but- 
ter-bur, half a pound; roots of burdock, one pound ; angelica 
and masterwort, of each half a pound ; leaves of scordium, six 
handsful; Venice treacle, and rnithridate, of each half a 
pound ; old Canary wine, two pounds ; white-wine vinegar, 
six pounds, and the same quantity of the juice of lemons. 
Distil all these in an alembic. - 

Lady Monmouth's Treacle Water. 

TAKE three ounces of hartshorn, shaved, and boiled in 
borage water, or succory, wood -sorrel, or respice water, or 
three pints of any of these waters boiled to a jelly, and put 
the jelly and hartshorn both into the still. Aad a pint more 
of these waters when put into the still. Take the root of ele- 
campane, gentian, cypress, tuninsil, of each an ounce; bless- 
ed thistle, called catduus, and angelica, of each an ounce; 
sorrel-roots, two ounces ; balm, sweet marjoram, and burnet, 
of each half a handful; lily-convally flowers, borage, bugloss, 
rosemary, and marigold flowers, of each two ounces ; citron 
rinds, carduus seeds, citron seeds, alkermes berries, and cochi- 
neal, each of these an ounce. Prepare all these simples thus : 
Gather the flowers as they come in season, and put them in 
glasses with a large mouth. Put with them as much good 
sack as will cover them, and tie up the glasses close with 
bladders wet in the sack, with a cork and leather upon that, 
adding more flowers and sack. Put cochineal into a pint 
bottle, with half a pint of sack, and tie it up close with a 
bladder under the cork, and another on the top, wet with 
sack. Then cover it up close with leather, and bury it, stand- 
ing upright in a bed of hot horse dung, nine or ten days. 
Then look at it, and if it is dissolved, take it out of the dung, 
but do not open it till it is distilled. Slice all the roots, beat 
the seeds and berries, and put them into another glass. Put 
no more sack among them than necessary ; and when in- 
tended to distil, take a pound of the best Venice treacle, and 
dissolve it in six pints of the best white wine, and three of red 
rose water. Put all the ingredients together, stir them, and 
Hstil them irj a glass still. 



CORDIAL WATERS. 343 



Lavender Water. 

PUT a quart of water to every pound of lavender neps, put 
them into a cold still, and make a slow fire under it. Distil it 
off very slowly, and put it into a pot till all the water is 
distilled. Then clean the still well out, and put the lavender 
water into it, and distil it off as slowly as before. Put it into 
bottles, and cork it well. 

Walnut Water. 

BRUISE well in a large mortar a peck of fine green wal- 
nuts, put them into a pan, with a handful of balm bruised, 
and two quarts of good Frencb brandy. Cover them close, 
and let them lie three davs. Then distil them in a cold still ; 
and from this quantity draw three quarts. 

Aqua Mirabilis. 

TAKE cubebs, cardamums, galingal, cloves, mace, nut- 
megs, and cinnamon, of each two drachms, and bruise them 
small. Then take a pint of the juice of celandine, half a pint 
of the juice of spearmint, and the same quantity of the juice 
of balm; flowers of melilot, cowslip, rosemary, borage, bug- 
loss, and marigold, of each three drachms ; seeds of fennel, 
coriander, and carraway, of each two drachms ; two quarts of 
the best sack, and a quart of white wine; brandy, the strong 1 - 
st angelica water, and rose water, of each a pint. Bruise 
the spices and seeds, and steep them, with the herbs and 
flowers, in the juices, waters, sack, white wine, and brandy, 
all night. In the morning, distil it in a common still pasted 
up, and from this quantity draw off a gallon at least. Sweeten 
it to the taste with sugarcandy, then bottle it up, and keep it 
in a cool place. 

Blgck Cherry Water. 

BRUISE six pounds of black cherries, and put to them the 
tops of rosemary, sweet marjoram, spearmint, angelica, balm, 
and marigold flowers, of each a handful; dried violets, an 
ounce ; anise seeds, and sweet fennel seeds, of each half an 
ounce bruised. Cut the herbs small, mix all together, and 
distil them off in a cold still. 

Surfeit Water. 

TAKE scurvygrass, brooklime, water cresses, Roman worm- 
wood, rue, mint, balm, sage, and clives, of each one handful; 
green merery, two handsful ; poppies, if freib, half a peck ; 



844 



CORDIAL WATERS. 



but if dry, only half that quantity ; cochineal and saffron, 
six pennyworth of each ; anise seeds, carraway seeds, corian- 
der seeds, and cardamum seeds, of each an ounce ; two 
ounces of scraped liquorice, a pound of split figs, the same 
quantity of r.tisins- of the sun stoned, an ounce of juniper 
berries bruised, an ounce of beaten nutmeg, an ounce of mace 
bruised, and the same of sweet fennel seeds also bruised ; a 
few flowers of rosemary, marigold, and sage. Put all these 
into a large stone jar, and put to them three gallons of 
French brandy. Cover it close, and let it stand near the fire 
for three weeks. Stir it three times a week, and be sure to 
keep it closely stopped, and then strain it off. Bottie the li- 
quor, and pour on the ingredients a bottle more of French 
brandy. Let it stand a week, stirring it once a day, then 
distil it in a cold still. This is best made in summer, but it 
may be made at any time of the year in London, because the 
ingredients are always to be had either green or dry. 

Hysterical Water. 

TAKE betony roots, lovage, and seeds of wild parsnip, of 
each two ounces ; four ounces of roots of single peony, 
three ounces of misletoe of the oak, a quarter of an ounce of 
myrrh, and half an ounce of castor. Beat all these together, 
and add to them a quarter of a pound of dry millepedes. Pour 
on these three quarts of mugwort water, and two quarts of 
brandy. Let them stand in a close vessel eight days, and then 
distil them in a cold still pasted up. Draw off nine pints of 
water, and sweeten it to the taste. Mix all together, and 
bottle it up. 

Orange or Lemon Water. 

PUT three gallons of brandy and two quarts of sack to the 
outer rinds of a hundred oranges or lemons, and let them 
steep in it one night. Tne next day distil them in a cold 
still. A gallon with the proportion of peels will be enough 
for one still, and from that draw off better than three quarts. 
Draw it off till it begins to taste sour. Sweeten it to the 
taste with double-refined sugar, and mix the first, second, and 
third runnings together. If lemon water, it should be per- 
fumed with two grains of ambergris, and one of musk. Grind 
them fine, tie them in a rag, and let it hang five or six days 
iii each bottle ; or put into them three or four drops of tinc- 
ture of ambergris. Be sure to cotk it well. 



MALT LIQUORS. 345 

Imperial Water. 

TAKE a large jar, and put into it two ounces of cream of 
tartar, with the juice and peels of two lemons. Pour on them 
seven quarts of boiling water, and when it is cold, clear it 
through a gauze sieve, sweeten it to the taste, and bottle it. 
The next day it will be fit for use. 

Spirits of Wine. 

PUT the bottoms of strong beer, and any kind of wines, 
into a cold still about three parts full. Then make a slow h're 
under it, and take care to keep it moderate, otherwise it will 
boil over, the body being so strong that it will rise to the top 
of the still ; and the slower it is distilled, the stronger thu 
spirit will be. Put it into an earthen pot whilst distilling, 
and then clean the still well out. Put the spirit into it, and 
distil it slowly as before, till it is strong enough to burn in a 
lamp. Bottle it, and then cork it well. 

Fever Water. 

TAKE six ounces of Virginia sn.ike root, four ounces of 
carduus seeds and marigold Howers, and twenty green wal- 
nuts; carduus water, and poppy water, two quarts of each, 
and two ounces of hartshorn. Slice the walnuts, and steep 
all in the waters a fortnight. Then add to it an ounce of 
London treacle, and distil the whole in an alembic pasted up. 



CHAPTER III. 



MALT LIQUORS. 

1 HE first thing to be considered, is, undoubtedly, the being 
provided with implements proper for the purpose, and of these 
the copper appears to be the first object. 

The position of the copper, and the manner of setting it, 
must be duly considered, as much depends thereon. The 
manner proper to be adopted is, to divide the fire by a stop ; 
and, if the door and draught be in a direct line, the stop 
should be erected from the middle of each outline of the 
jgrating,and parallel with the centre sides of the copper. By 



346 MALT LIQUORS. 

this method, the middle of the fire will be directly under the 
bottom of the copper. The stop is composed of a thin wall, 
in the centre of the right and left sides of the copper, which 
is to ascend half the height of the copper. On the top 
must be left a cavity from four to six inches, for a draught for 
the half part of the fire which is next the door of the cop- 
per ; and then the building must close all round to the finish- 
ing at the top. 

By this mode of erecting the copper, the heat will commu- 
nicate from the outward part of the fire round the outward 
half of the copper, through the cavity, as does the furthest 
part of the flue, which also contracts a conjunction of the 
whole, and causes the flame gently and equally round the 
bottom cf the copper. 

Many are the advantages derived from this manner of pro- 
ceeding, and the fuel saved thereby is no small object of con- 
sideration. It has considerably the pre-eminence of wheel- 
draughts ; for with them, if there be not particular attendance 
given to the hops, by stirring them down, they are apt to 
stick to the sides and scorch ; and this will undoubtedly very 
much hurt the flavour of the liquor. The copper will also, 
by this method, last many years more than it would by the 
wheel draught; for that draws with so much violence, that 
should the liquor be beneath the communication of the fire, 
the copper will thereby be liable to be damaged : whereas, 
by the other contrivances, you may boil half a copper full 
without fear of injury. This must be allowed to be a great 
advantage, as in all brewing it is impossible to draw it clean 
off the mash. 

In order to give greater expedition to the operation, you 
may sometimes wish to extend this advantage to a few pails 
full, which is done without prejudice to the other; for when 
the whole of the other is clean drawn off, the copper will 
accomplish the intended purpose next morning, which will 
prevent interfering with your natural rest; for by running 
the whole night, it will be ready to boil in the morning, and 
be fit to add to the working of the other small beer, in time 
to render the whole complete for tunning. By this method, 
also, you are not under the necessity of having the copper 
burned, which is a very troublesome and disagreeable busi- 
ness, to unfix and refix large cocks, which is likewise attended 
with great expense. 

Another inconvenience too frequently found in coppers is, 
their being made too exact to their intended quantity ; in 
consequence of which, room is not left sufficient to boil the 
liquor in with any degree of rapidity or safety, which must 
naturally be supposed to be essential points. To remedy this 



MALT LIQUORS. 347 

inconvenience, let your carpenter prepare good seasoned 
pieces of elm, or other proper wood, and shape it out like the 
felly of a stage waggon-wheel, but only half its thickness, and 
then join them round to compose the dimensions of the circle 
of the copper. The rim of the copper, which generally 
turns over as a bearing at the top, may be beat up, and that 
part nailed to the bottom part of the wood-work, brushing 
between the wood-work and the copper a cement composed 
of bullock's blood and whiting, mixed only to the thickness 
of common whitewash. This cement will prevent any leak, 
and last as long as the copper. 

Though the wood-work may be done with great safety all 
round, yet it will be necessary to take this precaution, never 
to let the wood-work join nearer than eight inches on each 
side of the copper flue, or the communication of the heat. 
If there be any apprehension of its penetrating through in 
that direction, you must then nail either brass, copper, plate- 
iron, or sheet-lead, whichever can be most conveniently got- 
ten. Ir your neighbourhood cannot furnish you with these 
matters, there wilt probably be always a sufficient supply in 
your house of decayed pots, pans, or kettles, which may be 
beat out to suit your purpose : any smith, tinker, or carpenter, 
&c. can execute such a piece of work, observing the same 
cement, which will be as good and as firm as solder in other 
matters. 

This work is of great support and ease to the copper ; and 
by this mode you can also increase its dimensions from three 
to twelve or more inches in the wood-work, which will add 
considerably to your guage, especially in large coppers. 
This method, however, is recommended only where stop- 
draughts are made, use of, in which case the wood may be ap- 
plied round with great safety; for the fires of those never burn 
so furiously that the least damage can ensue. For the raisino- 
of other coppers, built on different constructions, brick, stone, 
or tarris mortar may be used. 

The next to be considered are the coolers, and these are 
things of no small consequence ; for, if they are not properly 
taken care of, the liquor, Jby a seemingly secret and unac- 
countable cause, will attract a disagreeable twang. This often 
proceeds from \vet having been infused in the wood, as it is 
sometimes apt to lodge in the crevices of old coolers, and even 
infect them to such a degree, that it will not depart, though 
many washings and scaldings are applied. One cause inci- 
dental to this evil is permitting women to wash in a brew- 
house, which ought by no means to be permitted, where any 
other convenience is to be had j for nothing can be more hurt- 
ful than the slops of soap-suds. 



SIS MALT LIQUORS. 

Be careful, in preparing the coolers, never to let the water 
stand too long in them, as it will soak in, and soon turn pu- 
trid, when the stench will enter the wood, and render them 
almost incurable. To prevent such consequences, as well as 
to answer good purposes, it has by some been recommended, 
where all fixed brewhouses are intended, that all the coolers 
should be leaded. In the first place such are exceedingly 
cleanly; and, secondly, it expedites the cooling of part of 
the liquor worts, which is very necessary to forward it for 
working, as well as afterwards for cooling the whole ; lor 
evaporation causes considerably more waste than proper 
boiling. Chymists tell us, that the more the steam, the more 
the strength of any fluid is exhausted ; as is further proved 
by the still, where the steam being confined, the chief strength 
is kept in ; but, being exposed to the air, it soon evaporates. 

It will also be indispensably necessary, in the preparation of 
your utensils, that the coolers be well scoured with cold water 
two or three times ; cold water being more proper than hot to 
effect a perfect cleansing, especially if they are in a bad con- 
dition from the undiscovered filth that may be in the crevices. 
The application of hot water will drive the infection further ; 
or if your drink be let into the coolers, and if any remain in 
the crevices, as before mentioned, the heat will collect the 
foulness, and render the whole unwholesome. 

Some pretended judges of this matter absurdly argue, that 
ropiness in beer proceeds from the want of a sufficient quan- 
tity of hops to dispel the glutinous richness arising from the 
superiority of malt, which is a manifest mistake, except when 
it is too much boiled, and receives bad management after- 
wards. Others say, that it is by applying the water too sharp, 
that is, too hot to mash with ; but, if the water did not produce 
that fault, it has another equally as dangerous ; and that is, 
when you mash with water so exceedingly hot, it is liable to 
set the malt; which is clogging it up to such a degree, that it 
is almost impossible to get it to run off; and when by art 
you have accomplished the difficulty, it never answers your 
wishes in point of goodness. 

To show, by an experiment, the disagreements of heats and 
colds, which must be applicable in the case of brewing, pro- 
ceed thus : Take a pail of cold water, and throw it on a quan- 
tity of grains, and it will almost immediately become ropy. 
There are, however, some brewers so curious as to put cold 
water on the mash, and vainly imagine that it gets out the 
whole of the strength ; but this is a ridiculous notion, which 
cannot get a favourable reception, notwithstanding they say it 
makes excellent toplash, or rather rot-gut small beer. 

It is very singular, that some families should have such an 



MALT LIQUORS. 34* 

aversion to the thoughts of brewing, which probably arises 
from the terrible apprehensions they conceive of the expense 
and incumbrance attending the fitting up of a brewhouse, 
which is an ill-founded conception, and ought to have no 
weight in a rational ruind. It is not from being sufficiently 
competent to know better, that people set their faces against 
brewing ; but it is from pride, that bane of all good, that sets 
them above so inconsiderable a thought, as they deem it, and 
a total negligence of their own and their country's welfare. 
A whole set of coolers, properly made, may be removed from 
house to house with great facility and little expense, and 
with less injury than other furniture, provided they are made 
according to the following directions: 

Let strong frames be constructed for each cooler, in such a 
manner, that they may be unwedged and taken asunder when 
occasion requires. The outside frame should turn up pretty 
high, that is, sufficiently thick and strong, to cut a proper 
inlet to receive wedges for the purposes hereafter mentioned. 
Form your coolers, which are to consist of only common 
planed deal boards, and lay them even to fit on this frame, 
which, from a projection and inlet, you can set the side to the 
bottom, and it will be necessary that the inlet should be a Jit- 
tie lower than where the bottom rests. By these means, the 
wedges will have full power to tighten the sides to as great an 
extremity as a hooped barrel ; and these wedges should be in 
three regular directions on the sides, and at two places at each 
end, which will form perfect firmness. If the coolers are 
made in regular sizes under each other, you may set strong 
casters in mortices under the legs, by which means you can 
drive them under each other, so as the whole to go under the 
uppermost, which is a good method of setting them out of 
harm's way. By this method of construction, the chief of 
your brewing utensils, the copper excepted, may be unwedged, 
and with little trouble packed into a waggon, in the space of 
two hours, and set up in another brewhouse in the like pro- 
portionable time. If you should afterwards choose to dispose 
of the materials, that may be done without loss, as the boards 
will not be damaged by either pins, nails, or screws. When 
a small quantity, such as a hogshead only, is required, they 
may be made like drawers, pulling out in grooves, and resting 
on tressels, which may be very conveniently put out of dan- 
ger in the jnanner before directed. 

Be particularly careful that the mash-tub be kept perfectly 
clean : nor must the grains be left in the tub any longer than 
the day after browing, lest it should sour the tub ; for if there 
be a sour smell in the brewhouse before your beer is tunned, it 
will be apt to infect your liquor and worts. 



3 50 MALT LIQUOKS. , 

To render your tub the more perfect and lasting you should 
have a circular piece of brass or copper, to inlay and line the 
hole where the penstaff enters, to let the wort run off into 
the under back. The penstaff should be also stoutly ferrelled 
with the same metal, and both well and taperly finished, so 
that you can place it properly. By this method you may 
have it run from the fineness of a thread to the fulness of an 
inch tube, &c. first dressing your muck-basket with straw, 
fern, or little bushy furze without stems, six or eight inches in 
from the bottom of your basket} and set quite perpendicularly 
over the whole, with the penstaff through the centre of the 
basket, and the middle of the furze or fern, and fastened into 
the hole of the tub. To steady it properly, you must have 
a piece of iron let into a staple fastened to the tub, at the 
nearest part opposite to the basket, and to reach nearly to it ; 
and from that place another added on a jointed swivel, or 
any other contrivance, so as to be at liberty to let round the 
basket like a dog-collar, and to enter into the staple formed 
in the same to pin it fast, and by adding a half-circular turn 
in the collar, in which you have room to drive in a wedge, 
which will keep it safe down to the bottom, when there can 
be no danger of its being disturbed by stirring the mash, 
which will otherwise sometimes be the case. When you let 
go, you will raise the penstaff to your own degree of running, 
and then fasten the staff by the help of two wedges tightened 
between the staff and the basket. 

The copper-work, in process of time, like every thing 
else, will become defective ; and when this is the case, the 
following very simple remedy will make the parts as perfect 
as ever: work the penstaff in the brass socket with emery 
and water, or oil, which will make it perhaps more perfect 
than when new, and many instances have been seen of this 
method being used with cocks just purchased. 

It would be no inconsiderable addition to the conveniency 
of the under back, to have a piece of copper to line the whole 
in the bottom, which may be stopped with a cloth put singly 
round a large cork ; and when it is fastened down for the 
wort to run, it will be necessary to put a large weight on the 
cork, which will prevent its flying up by the heat. When the 
liquor is pumped clean out of the back, the cloth round the 
cork will enable you to take out the cork with ease ; and there 
should be a drain below the under back to carry off the water, 
which will enable you to wash it perfectly clean with very 
little trouble. This drain should be made with a clear descent, 
so that no damp may remain under the back. With the con- 
venience of water running into your copper, you may be ena- 
bled to work that water in a double quantity, your under 



MALT LIQUORS. 351 

back being filled by the means of letting it in at your lei- 
sure, out of your copper, through a shoot to the mash-tub, 
and so to the under back. Thus you will have a reserve 
against the time you wish to fill your copper, which may be 
completed in a few minutes, by pumping while the upper 
cock is running. Thus much for the principal utensils in 
brewing ; but be careful to keep every thing perfectly clean. 

As we have now properly explained the precautions neces- 
sary to be taken in the preparation of vessels, we shall enter 
into a concise detail of what is to be observed in the course 
of brewing. 

Having your utensils scalded, your malt ground, your cop- 
per boiling, and your penstaff well set, you must then pro- 
ceed to mash, by letting a sufficient quantity of boiling water 
into your tub, in which it must stand until the greater part of 
the steam is gone off, or until you can see your own shadow 
in it. It will then be necessary that one person should pour 
the malt gently in, while another is carefully stirring it ; for 
it is as necessary that as much care should be observed when 
the mash is thin as when it is thick. This being effectually 
and well done, and having a sufficient reserve of malt to cover 
the mash, to prevent evaporation, you may cover your tub 
with sacks, &c. and leave your malt three hours to steep. 

Previous to your letting the mash run, you should not fail 
to be prepared with a pail to catch the first flush, as that is 
generally thickish ; and another pail being applied while you 
return the first on the mash, and so on for two or three times, 
or at least until it run fine. B} r this time your copper should 
be boiling, and a convenient tub placed close to your mash- 
tub ; let into it through your spout half the quantity of boil- 
ing water you mean to use for drawing off your best wort. 
After this, you must instantly turn your cock to fill up again, 
which will boil in due time with cinders or coal-ashes. Dur- 
ing such time, you must stop the mash with this hot water 
out of the convenient tub, in moderate quantities, every eight 
or ten minutes, until the whole is consumed ; then letting off 
the remaining quantity, which will be boiling hot, to the finish- 
ing purpose for strong beer. 

You must then fill your copper quite full, so as to boil 
quickly for the second mash, whether you intend it for ale 
or small beer. Being thus far prepared, let off the remain- 
ing quantity of water into the tub, as you did for the strong 
beer, stopped up as before ; but if you would have small 
beer besides, you must judge it accordingly, by boiling a 
proper quantity off in due time, and letting it into the tub 
as before. It is better to avoid the latter article, that you 
may entirely draw out the strength for the ale. 



352 MALT LIQUORS. 

Twenty-four bushels of malt will make two hogsheads of 
as good strong beer as any it) England, and also two hogs- 
heads of very pretty ale, but the malt should consist of equal 
portions of brown, amber, and pale. This strong beer should 
be kept two or three years, and the ale never less than one, 
before tapped. If your mash be oniv for one hogshead, it 
should be two hours in running off; if for two hogsheads, two 
hours and a half ; and for any greater quantity, three hours: 
for there is no good in letting it be too long, as the whole 
strength is extracted by the frequent stoppings. 

You must be particular in the time of steeping your mashes. 
Strong beer must be allowed three hours ; ale one hour ; 
and, if you draw small beer after, half an hour. By this 
mode of proceeding, your boilings will regularly take place 
of each other, which will expedite the business, by prevent- 
ing loss of time. Be particularly careful, in the course of 
each mashing, that it be thoroughly stirred from the bottom, 
and especially round the muck basket ; for, being well 
shaken, it prevents a stagnation of the whole body of the 
mash; and were this last process omitted, it would certainly 
fox your beer, and give it an exceeding bad taste. 

In preparing for boiling, be particularly careful to put the 
hops in with the first wort, or it will char in a few minutes. 
As soon as the copper is full enough, a good fire should be 
made under it; but be careful, in filling it, to leave room 
enough for boiling. Quick boiling is one of the most ne- 
cessary things to be observed ; though in this particular there 
are variety of opinions. However, there is perhaps but one 
good method, and that is quick boiling. Great caution should 
be observed when it begins to swell in waves in tiie copper; 
if you have no assistant, be particularly attentive to its mo- 
tions; and being provided with an iron rod of a proper 
length, crooked at one end, and jagged at the other, then 
with the crook you are enabled to open the furnace, or copper 
door, and vith the other end push in the damper, without 
stirring from your station ; but on the approach of the first 
swell, you will have sufficient time to proportionate your 
fire, as care should be taken that it be not too predominant. 
When the boil is properly got under, you may t'.ien add a 
fire that will boil briskly, and there may be a variation of a 
few minutes. 

With respect to the time it should boil, experienced brewers 
proceed in this manner: They take a clean copper bowl 
dish, to dip out some of the liquor, and when they discover a 
working, and the hops sinking, they conclude it to be suffi- 
ciently boiled. This is sometimes completed in thirty-five or 
forty minutes j but this rule is often extended five or ten mi- 



MALT LIQUORS. 353 

iiutes, according to the different qualities of malt. Long and 
slow boiling is very pernicious, as well as wasting the liquor ; 
for the slower it boils, the lower it drops, and singes to your 
copper ; whereas quick boiling has a contrary effect. Essence 
of malt is extracted by length of boiling,-by which you can 
make it to the thickness of honey or treacle, so that a small 
quantity will weigh pounds. In some parts of Yorkshire, 
they value their liquor for its great strength, by its affecting 
the brain for two or three days after intoxication. 'This is the 
effect of long boiling ; for in that county they boil liquor for 
three hours ; and what is still worse, when it sinks in the cop- 
per, from the waste in boiling, they every now and then add 
a little fresh wort, which, without doubt must tend to several 
stagnations, productive of several impurities. 

lour liquor being properly boiled, be sure to traverse a 
small quantity quite over all the coolers, so as to get a proper 
quantity cold immediately to set to work; but if the airiness 
of your brewhouse is not sufficient to expedite a quantity 
soon, you must traverse a second quantity over the coolers, 
and then let it into shallow tubs. Put these into any passage 
where there is a thorough draught of air, but where no ram 
or other wet can get communication to it. Then let off the 
quantity of two baring tubsful from the first over the second 
and third coolers, which may be soon got cold, to be ready 
for a speedy working, and then the remaining part that is in 
your copper may be quite let out into the first cooler. In 
the meantime, mend the fire, and also attend to the hops, tor 
make a clear passage through the strainer. Having pro- 
ceeded thus far, as soon as the liquor is done running, return 
to your business of pumping, but be sure to remember, 
that, when you have got four or five pailsful, you then return 
all the hops into the copper for the ale. 

By this time, the small quantity of liquor traversed over 
your coolers being sufficiently cooled, you must now proceed 
to set your liquor to work. Take four quarts of barm, and 
divide half of it into small vessels, such as clean bowls, ba- 
sons, or mugs, adding thereto an equal quantity of wort, 
which should be almost cold. As soon as it ferments tc the 
top of the vessel, put it into two pails, and when that works 
to the top, put one into a baring tub, and the other into ano^ 
ther. When you have half a baring tubful together, you 
may put the like quantity to each of them, and then cover 
them over, until it comes to a fine cauliflower head. This 
may be perfectly completed in three hours, and then put 
those two quantities into the working guile. You may now 
add as much wort as you have got ready, for you cannot work 
it too cold in open weather. 

A A 



3 54 MALT LIQUORS. 

If you brew in cold frosty weather, keep the brewhouse 
warm, but never add hot wort to keep the liquor to a blood 
heat, that being a bad maxim ; for hot wort put to cold, as 
well as cold to hot, is so intemperate in its nature, that it 
stagnates the proper operation of the barm. 

You must be careful that your barm be not from foxed 
beer, that is, beer heated by ill management in its working ; 
for in that case it is likely to carry with it the contagion. If 
your barm be flat, and you cannot procure that which is new, 
the method of recovering its working is, by putting to it a 
pint of warm sweet wort of your first letting off, the heat to 
be of half the degree of milk warm. Then give your mug 
that contains it a shake, and it will soon gather strength and 
be fit for use. Haifa pound of good hops is sufficient for a 
bushel of malt for strong beer, to keep for four years, twelve 
bushels to the hogshead. 

We come now to the last and most simple operation in the 
business of brewing, which is the tunning. The general me- 
thods of doing this are, either by having it carried down on 
men's shoulders, or conveying it into the cellar by the means 
of leathern pipes, commonly used for that purpose. 

Your casks being perfectly clean, sweet, and dry, and set 
on the stand ready to receive the liquor, first skim off the top 
barm, then proceed to fill your casks quite full, and imme- 
diately bung and peg them close. Bore a hole with a tap- 
borer near the summit of the stave, at the same distance from 
the top as the lower tap-hole is from the bottom, for working 
through that upper hole, which is a clean and more effectual 
method than working it over the cask; for, by the above 
method, being so closely confined, it soon sets itself into a 
convulsive motion of working, and forces itself fine, provided 
you attend to the filling of your casks five or six times a day : 
for by too long an omission it begins to settle, and afterwards 
being disturbed, it raises a sharp fermentation, which pro- 
duces an incessant working of a spurious froth, that may 
continue for some weeks, and after all give your beer a crank- 
ish taste, which proper attention might have prevented. 

Having thus gone through the principal matters in the 
practical part of brewing, we shall now proceed to instruct 
the housekeeper in the management of malt liquors, the pro- 
per time for brewing, and shall make some observations on 
the different qualities of water, malt and hops. 

The month of March is generally considered as one of the 
principal seasons for brewing malt liquor for long keeping ; 
and the reason is, because the air at that time of the year is 
temperate, and contributes to the good working and fermen- 
tation of the liquor, which principally promotes its pre- 



MALT LIQUORS. 355 

servation, and good keeping. Very cold as well as very hot 
weather, prevents the free fermentation or Avorking of li- 
quors ; so that, if you brew in very cold weather, unless you 
use some means to warm the cellar while new drink is work- 
ing, it will never clear itself in the manner you would wish; 
and the same misfortune will arise, if in very hot weather, the 
cellar be not put into a temperate state. The consequence of 
all which will be, that such drink will be muddy and sour, 
perhaps beyond all recovery. Such misfortunes often hap- 
pen, even in the proper season for brewing, and that owing 
to the badness of a cellar, for when they are dug in springy 
grounds, or are subject to damps in winter, the liquor will 
chill, and grow flat and dead. Where cellars are of this na- 
ture, it will be advisable to make your brewings in March, 
rather than in October ; for you may keep such cellars tem- 
perate in summer, but cannot warm them in winter. Thus 
your beer brewed in March will have due time to settle and 
adjust itself before the cold can materially injure it. 

It is advisable to build your cellars for Keeping liquors after 
such a manner, that no external air can get into them ; for 
the variation of the air abroad, were there free admission of it 
into the cellars, would cause as many altercations in the li- 
quor, and would thereby keep them in so unsettled a state, as 
to render them unfit for drinking. Some people, curious in 
these matters, have double doors to their cellars with a view 
that none of the external air may find a way into them, and 
are amply repaid for their care and expense by the goodness 
of their liquor. The intent of the double door is, to keep 
one shut while the other is open, that the external air may 
be excluded. Such cellars, if they lie dry as they ought to do, 
are said to be cold in summer, and warm in winter; though, 
in reality, they are constantly the same in point of tempera- 
ture. They seem, indeed, cold in hot weather, but that is 
only because we go into them from a hotter air abroad; and 
the same mode of reasoning will hold good, with respect to 
their appearing warmer in winter. Hence it is evident, that 
they are only cold or warm comparatively, as the air we come 
out of is colder or warmer. This should be the peculiar pro- 
perty of a cellar, if we expect to have good liquor out of it. 
As for the brewing part itself, we have already considered 
that matter; what we shall therefore further principally touch 
upon, besides speaking of cellaring, will relate to water, malt, 
hops, and the proper keeping of liquors. 

To speak in general, the best water is river-water, such as 
is soft, and has partaken of the air and sun ; for this easily 
insinuates itself into the malt, and extracts its virtues. On 
the contrary, hard waters astringe and bind the pores of th 

A A2 



356 MALT LIQUORS. 

malt, so that its virtue is n6t freely communicated to the 
liquor. It is a rule with some, that all water that will mix 
with soap is fit for brewing, and they will by no means allow 
of any other; and it has been more than once experienced, 
that where the same quantity of malt has been used to a barrel 
of river-water, as to a barrel of spring-water, the river-water 
brewing has excelled the other in strength about five degrees 
in twelve months. It must be observed likewise, that the 
malt was not only the same in quantity for one barrel as for 
the other, but was the same quality, having been all mea- 
sured from the same heap. The hops were also the same, 
both in quality and quantity, and the time and boiling equal 
to each. They were worked in the same manner, and tunned 
and kept in the same cellar. Here it was evident, that the 
only difference was in the water, and yet one barrel was worth 
two of the other. 

One thing has long puzzled the ablest brewers, and that is, 
when several gentlemen in the same town have employed the 
same brewer, have had the same malt, the same hops, and 
the same water, and brewed it in the same month, and broach- 
ed their drink at the same time, yet one has had beer extremely 
fine, strong, and well tasted, while the others have had hardly 
any worth drinking. There may be three reasons for this 
difference : One might be the difference of weather, which 
might happen at the several brewings in this month, and 
make an alteration in the working of the liquors. Secondly, 
that the yeast or barm might be of different sorts, or in dif- 
ferent states, wherewith these liquors were worked ; and 
thirdly, the cellars were not equally good. The goodness 
of such drink as is brewed for keeping, in a great measure de- 
pends on the goodness of the cellar in which it is kept. 

The Dorchester beer, which is so much admired, is for 
the most part brewed of chalky water, which is almost every 
where in that county ; and as the soil is generally chalk, the 
cellars, being dug in that dry soil, contribute to the good 
keeping of their drink, it being of a close texture, arid of a 
drying quality, so as to dissipate damps; for damp cellars, we 
find by experience, are injurious to the keeping of liquors, as 
well as destructive to the casks. A constant temperate air 
digests and softens malt liquors, so that they taste quite smooth 
on the palate; but in cellars which are unequal, by letting 
in heats and colds, the liquor is subject to grow stale and 
sharp. For this reason it is that liquor brewed for long voy- 
ages at sea. should be perfectly ripe and fine before it be ex- 
ported ; for when it has had sufficient time to digest in the 
cask., and is racked from the bottom, or lee, it will bear car- 
riage without injury. 



MALT LIQUORS. S5f 

It has been observed , that in proportion to the quantity of 
liquor which is enclosed in one cask, so will it be to a longer or 
shorter time in ripening. A vessel, containing two hogsheads 
of beer, will require twice as much time to perfect itself as 
one of a hogshead ; and it is found by experience, that no 
vessel should be used for strong beer, which is intended to be 
kept, less than a hogshead, as one of that quantity, if it be fit 
to draw it in a year, has body enough to support it two, three 
or four years, if it have strength oif malt and hops in it, as 
the Dorchester beer has. 

One great piece of economy is the good management of 
small beer; for if that be not good, the drinkers of it will be 
feeble in summer-time, incapable of strong work, and will be 
very subject to distempers. Besides, when the beer is not 
good, a great deal will be thrown away. The use of drink, 
as well as meat, is to nourish the body; and the more labour 
there is upon any one, the more substantial should be the 
diet. In harvest-time, the ill effects of bad beer among the 
workmen are visible ; and in great families, where that article 
has not been attended to, the apothecaries bills have amounted 
to twice as much as the malt would have come to, that would 
have kept the servants in strength and good health. Besides, 
good wholesome drink is seldom thrown away by servants, 
and thus the sparing of a little malt ends in the loss of the 
master. Where there is good cellaring, therefore, it is ad- 
visable to brew a stock of small beer in March or October, 
or in both rnonths, to keep in hogsheads, if possible. The 
beer brewed in March should not be tapped till October, nor 
that brewed in October, till the March following ; having this 
regard to the quantity, that a family, of the same number of 
working persons, will drink a third more in summer than in 
winter. 

If water happen to be of a hard nature, it may be softened 
by exposing it to the air and sun, and putting into it some 
pieces of soft chalk to infuse ; or, when the water is set on to 
boil, in order to be poured on the malt, put into it a quantity 
of bran, which will help a little to soften it. 

One thing more is to be mentioned, respecting the preser- 
vation of strong beer, and that is, when once the vessel is 
broached, regard ought to be had to the time in which it will 
be expended; for, if there happen to be a quick draught for 
it, then it will last good to the very bottom ; but, if there 
be likely to be but a slow draught, then do not draw off quit?, 
half before you bottle it, otherwise your beer will grow 
flat, dead, or sour. This is observed very much among the 
curious. 

We shall now mention two or three particulars relative 



358 MALT LIQUORS. 

to malt, whjch may help those who are unacquainted with 
brewing. In the first place, the general distinction between 
one malt and another is, only that the one is high and the other 
low dried. That which we call high dried will, when brewed, 
produce a liquor of a deep brown colour ; and the other 
which is the low dried, will produce a liquor of a pale colour. 
The first js dried in such a manner as may be said rather to 
be scorched than dried, and is far less wholesome than the 
pale malt. It has also been experienced that brown malt, al- 
though it be well brewed, will sooner turn sharp than the pale 
malt, if that be fairly brewed. 

A gentleman of good experience in the brewery says, that 
the brown malt makes the best drink when it is brewed with a 
coarse river water, such as that of the Thames about London : 
and that likewise being brewed with such water, it makes 
very good ale ; but that it will not keep above six months 
without turning stale, and a little sharp, even though he allows 
fourteen bushels to the hogshead. He adds, that he has 
tried the high-dried malt to brew beer with for keeping, and 
hopped it accordingly and yet he could never bren- it so as to 
drink soft and mellow, like that brewed with pale malt. There 
is an acid quality in the high-dried malt, which occasions that 
distemper commonly called the heart-burn in those that drink 
of the ale or beer made of it. 

What we have here said of malt is meant that made of 
barley ; for wheat-malt, pea-malt, or those mixed with barley- 
malt, though they produce a high-coloured liquor, will keep 
many years, and drink soft and smooth, yet they have the 
mum flavour. 

Some people, who brew with high-dried barley-malt, put a 
bag, containing about three pints of wheat, into every hogs- 
head of liquor, and that has fined it, and made it drink mel- 
low. Others have put about three pints of wheat-malt into a 
hogshead, which has produced the same effect. But all malt- 
liquors, however well they may be brewed, may be spoiled 
by bad cellaring, and be now and then subject to ferment in 
the cask, and consequently turn thick and sour. The best 
way to help this, and bring the liquor to itself, is to open the 
bung of the cask for two or three days, and, if that does not 
stop the fermentation, then put in two or three pounds of 
oyster-shells, washed, burned, and then beaten to fine powder. 
Stir it a little, and it will presently settle .the liquor, make it 
fine, and take off the sharp taste. As soon as that is done, 
draw it off into another vessel, and put a small bag of wheat 
or wheat-malt into it, as before directed, or in proportion to 
the size of the vessel. Sometimes such fermentations will 
Happen in liquor by change of weather, if it be in a bad 



MALT LIQUORS. 359 

cellar, and will, in a few months, fall fine of itself, and grow 
mellow. 

High-dried malt should not be used in brewing, till it has 
been ground ten days, or a fortnight, as it then yields much 
stronger drink than" the same quantity of malt just ground; 
but if you design to keep malt ground some time before you 
use it, you must take care to keep it very dry, and the air at 
that time must also be dry. As for pale malt, which has not 
partaken so much of the fire it must not remain ground above 
a week before you use it. The best mode of using malt, is to 
take equal portions of brown, amber, and pale. 

As for hops, the newest are much the best, though they 
will remain very good two years: but after that they begin to 
decay and loose their flavour, unless great quantities are kept 
together, in which case they will keep much longer good than 
in small quantities. These, for their better preservation, 
should be kept in a very dry place ; though the dealers in. 
them rather choose such places as are moderately between moist 
and dry, that they may not lose any of their weight. Notice 
must here be taken of a method which has been used to stale 
and decayed hops, to make them recover their bitterness ; 
and this is, to unbag them, and sprinkle them with aloes and 
water, which, when it has proved a bad hop year, has spoiled 
great quantities of malt liquor about London : for even where 
the water, the malt, the brewer, and the cellars, are each 
good, a bad hop will spoil all. Hence it is evident, that every 
one of these particulars should be well chosen before the 
brewing is set about, or else you must expect but a bad ac- 
count of your labour. So likewise the yeast or barm which 
you work your liquor with, must be well considered, or a good 
brewing may be spoiled by that alone. 

Remember always to be provided with every material be- 
fore you begin your brewing, as the wort will not wait for 
any thing. 

It is a practice in some places remote from town, to dip 
whisks into yeast, then beat it well, and so hang up the whisks 
with the yeast in them to dry : and if there be no brewing till 
two months afterwards, the beating and stirring one of these 
neu- whisks in new wort will raise a working or a fermentation 
in it. It is a rule, that all liquor should be worked well in the 
tun, or keel, before it be put into the vessel, otherwise it 
will not easily grow fine. Some follow the rule of beating- 
down the yeast pretty often while it is in the tun, and keep it 
there working for two or three d;iys, observing to put it into 
the vessel just when the yeast begins to fall. This liquor is 
commonly very fine, whereas that which is put into the vessel 
quickly after it is brewed, will not be fine in many months. 



360 MALT LIQUORS. 

With respect to the season for brewing liquor to keep, it is 
to be observed, that if the cellars be subject to the heat of the 
sun, or warm summer air, it will be best to brew in October, 
that the liquor may have time to digest before the warm season 
comes on ; and if cellars be inclinable to damps, and to re- 
ceive water, the best time will be to brew in March. Some 
experienced brewers always choose to brew with the pale malt 
in March, and the brown in October ; for they suppose, that 
the pale malt being made with a less degree of fire than the 
other, wants the summer sun to ripen it ; and so, on the con- 
trary, the brown having had a larger share of the fire to dry 
it, is more capable of defending itself against the cold of the 
winter season. But these are merely matters of opinion. 

However careful you may have been in attending to all the 
preceding particulars, yet, if the casks be not in good order, 
still the brewing may be spoiled. New casks are apt to give 
liquor a bad taste, if they be not well scalded and seasoned 
several days successively before they are used. As to old 
casks, if they stand any time out of use, they are apt to grow 
musty. 

There now remains little more to be said concerning the 
management of malt liquor, but that of bottling it. The 
bottles must first be well cleaned and dried ; for wet bottles 
will make the liquor turn mouldy, or mothery, as they call it ; 
and by wet bottles a great deal of good beer has been spoiled. 
Though the bottles be clean and diy, yet if the corks be not 
new and sound, the liquor will be still liable to be damaged ; 
for, if the air can get into the bottles, the liquor will grow 
flat, and will never rise. Many who flattered themselves that 
they knew how to be saving, by using old corks on this occa- 
sion, have spoiled as much liquor as stood them in four or 
five pounds, only for want of laying out three or four shillings. 
If bottles are corked as they should be, it will be difficult to 
pull out the cork without a screw: and to be sure to draw the 
cork without breaking, the screw ought to go through the cork, 
and then the air must necessarily find a passage where the 
screw has passed, and therefore the cork must be good for 
nothing. If a cork has once been in a bottle, though it has 
not been drawn with a screw, yet that cork will turn musty 
as soon as it be exposed to the air, and will communicate its 
ill flavour to the bottle in which it is next put, and spoil the 
liquor that way In the choice of corks, take those that are 
soft and clear from specks. 

You may also observe, in the bottling of liquor, that the 
top and middle of the hogshead are -the strongest, and will 
ooner rise in the bottles than the bottom. When once you 



MALT LIQUORS. 361 

begin to bottle a vessel of any liquor, be sure not to leave it 
till all is completed, otherwise it will have different tastes. 

If you find that a vessel of liquor begins to grow flat whilst 
it is in common draught, bottle it, and into every bottle put 
a piece of loaf sugar about the size of a walnut, which will 
make it rise and come to itself; and to forward its ripening, 
you may set some bottles in hay in a warm place ; but straw 
will not assist its ripening. 

Where there are not good cellars, holes have been sunk in 
the ground, and large oil jars put into them, and the earth 
filled close about the sides. One of these jars may hold about 
a dozen quart bottles ; and will keep the liquor very well ; 
but the tops of the jars must be kept closely covered up. In 
winter-time, when the weather is frosty, shut up all the lights 
or windows of your cellars, and cover them close with horse- 
dung, or horse-litter ; but it is much better to have no lights 
or windows at all to any cellar, for the reasons before given. 

Should you have an opportunity of brewing a good stock of 
small beer in March and October, some of it may be bottled 
at six months' end, putting into every bottle a lump of loaf 
sugar. This will be a very refreshing drink in the summer. 
Or, if you happen to brew in summer, and are desirous of 
brisk small beer, as soon as it is done working, bottle it as 
above directed. 



APPENDIX. 



SECTION I. 



CONSIDERATIONS ON CULINARY POISONS. 

1 HOUGH we have already, in different parts of this work, 
occasionally reminded the housekeeper and cook of the fatal 
consequences attending coppers and saucepans not being pro- 
perly tinned, yet we shall here enter on a particular inquiry 
into the nature and property of culinary poisons, for the infor- 
mation and satisfaction of those who may wish to have a more 
perfect knowledge of such important matters. 

By the use of copper vessels for dressing our food, we are 
daily exposed to the danger of poison ; and even the very air 
of a kitchen, abounding with oleaginous and saline particles, 
disposes those vessels to solution before they are used. Cop- 
per, when handled, yields an offensive smell ; and, if touched 
with the tongue, has a sharp pungent taste, and even excites 
a nausea. Verdigrise is nothing but a solution of this metal 
by vegetable acids, and it is well known, that a very small 
quantity of this solution will produce cholics, vomitings, into- 
lerable thirst, universal convulsions, and other dangerous 
symptoms. If these effects, and the prodigious divisibility of 
this metal, be considered, there can be no doubt of its being 
a violent and subtle poison. Water, by standing some time 
in a copper vessel, becomes impregnated with verdigrise, as 
may be demonstrated by throwing into it a small quantity of 
any volatile alkali, which will immediately tinge it with a 
paler or deeper blue, in proportion to the rust contained in 
the water. Vinegar, apple-sauce, greens, oil, grease, butter, 
and almost every other kind of food, will extract the verdi- 
grise in a great degree. Some people imagine, that the ill 
effects of copper are prevented by its being tinned, which 
indeed is the only prevemative in that case ; but the tin, 
which adheres to the copper, is so extremely thin, that it is 
soon penetrated by the verdigrise, which insinuates itself 
through the pores of that metal, and appears green upon the 
surface. 



-APPENDIX. 363 

Verdigrise, is one of the most violent poisons in nature ; 
and yet, rather than quit an old custom, the greater part of 
mankind are content to swallow some of this poison every 
day. Our food receives its quantity of poison in the kitchen, 
by the use of copper pans and dishes ; the brewer mingles 
poison in your beer, by boiling it in copper; salt is distributed 
to the people from copper scales covered with verdigrise ; 
our pickles are rendered green by infusion of copper ; the 
pastry-cook bakes our tarts in copper patty-pans ; but con- 
fections and syrups have greater powers of destruction, as 
they are set over a fire in copper vessels which have not been 
tinned, and the verdigrise is plentifully extracted by the aci- 
dity of the composition. After all, though we do not swallow 
death in a_ single dose, yet it is certain that a quantity of poi- 
son, however small, which is repeated with every meal, must 
produce more fatal effects than is generally believed. 

Bell-metal kettles are frequently used in boiling cucumbers 
for pickling, in order to make them green ; but this is a prac- 
tice as absurd as it is dangerous. If the cucumbers acquire 
any additional greenness by the use of these kettles, they can 
only derive it from the copper, of which they are made ; 
and this very reason ought to be sufficient to overturn so 
dangerous a practice. 

According to some writers, bell-metal is a composition of 
tin and copper, or pewter and copper, in the proportion of 
twenty pounds of pewter, or twenty -three pounds of tin, to 
one hundred weight of copper. According to others, this 
metal is made in the proportion of one thousand pounds of 
copper to two or three hundred pounds of tin, and one hun- 
dred and fifty pounds of brass. Spoons, and other kitchen 
utensils are fre quently made of a mixed metal, called alche- 
my, or, as it is vulgarly pronounced, ochimy. The rust of 
this metal, as well as that of the former, is highly pernicious. 

The author of a tract entitled, Serious Reflections attend- 
ing the Use of Copper Vessels, published in London in 1755, 
asserts, that the great frequency of palsies, apoplexies, mad- 
ness, and all the frightful train of nervous disorders which 
suddenly attack us, without our being able to account for the 
cause, or which gradually weaken our vital faculties, are the 
pernicious effects of this poisonous matter, taken into the 
body insensibly with our victuals, and thereby intermixed with 
our blood and juices. 

However this may be, certain it is, that there have been in- 
numerable instances of the pernicious consequences of eating 
food dressed in copper vessels, not sufficiently cleaned from 
this rust. On this account the senate of Sweden, about the 
year H53, prohibited copper ressels, and ordered that noves- 



364- APPENDIX. 

sels, except such as were made of iron, should be used in their 
fleets and armies. But if copper vessels must be still conti- 
nued, every cook and good housewife should be particularly 
careful in keeping them clean and well tinned, and should 
suffer nothing to remain in them longer than is absolutely 
necessary for the purposes of cookery. 

Lead is a metal easily corroded, especially by the warm 
steams of acids, such as vinegar, cider, lemon-juice, Rhenish 
wine, &c. and this solution, or salt of lead, is a slow and in- 
sidious, though certain poison. The glazing of all our com- 
mon brown pottery ware is either lead or lead ore ; if black, it 
is a lead ore, with a small proportion of manganese, which is a 
species of iron ore ; if yellow, the glazing is lead ore, and ap- 
pears yellowish by having some pipe or white clay under it. 
The colour of the common pottery ware is red, as the vessels 
are made of the same clay as common bricks. These vessels 
are so porous, that they are penetrated by all salts acid or al- 
kaline, and are unfit for retaining any saline substances. They 
are improper, though too often used, for preserving sour fruits 
or pickles. The glazing of such vessels is corroded by the 
vinegar : for, upon evaporating the liquor, a quantity of the 
salt of lead will be found at the bottom. A sure way of judg- 
ing whether the vinegar or other acid, have dissolved part of 
the glazing, is by their becoming vapid, or losing their sharp- 
ness, and acquiring a sweetish taste by standing in them for 
some time, in which case the contents must be thrown away 
as pernicious. 

The substance of the pottery ware, commonly called Delft, 
the best being made at Delft in Holland, is a whitish clay 
when baked, and soft, as not having endured a great heat in 
baking, The glazing is a composition of calcined lead, cal- 
cined tin, sand, some coarse alkaline salt, and sandiver; which 
fceing run into a white glass, the white colour being owing to 
the tin, is afterwards ground in a mill, then mixed with water, 
and the vessels, after oeing baked in the furnace, are dipped 
into it, and put again into the furnace ; by which means, with 
a small degree of heat, the white glass runs upon the vessels. 
This glazing is exceedingly soft, and easily cracks. What 
effects acids will have upon it, the writer of these consi- 
derations cannot say ; but they seem to be improper for in- 
spissating the juice of lemons, oranges, or any other acid 
fruits. 

The most proper vessels for these purposes are porcelain or 
China ware, the substances of them being of so close a tex- 
ture, that no saline or other liquor can penetrate them. The 
glazing, which is likewise made of the substance of the china, 
is so firm and close, that no salt or saline substance can have the 



APPENDIX. 365 

least effect upon it. It must, however, be observed, that this 
remark is applicable only to the porcelain made in China ; 
for some species of the European manufactory are certainly 
glazed with a fine glass of lead, &c. 

The stone ware, commonly called Staffordshire ware, is the 
next to china. The substance of these vessels is a composi- 
tion of black flint, and a strong clay, that bakes white. Their 
outsides are glazed, by throwing into the furnace, when well 
heated, common or sea salt decrepitated, the steam or acid 
of which flying up among the vessels, vitrifies the outsides of 
them, and gives them the glazing. This stone ware does not 
appear to be injured or affected by any kind of salts, either 
acid or alkaline, or by any liquors, hot or cold. These are 
therefore extremely proper for all common uses ; but they 
require a careful management, as they are more apt to crack 
with any sudden heat, than china. 

Having thus considered the nature of copper and earthen 
utensils for the use of the kitchen, we shall proceed to make 
tome few remarks on the poisonous qualities of mushrooms, 
hemlock, and laurel. 

Mushrooms have been long used in sauces, in ketchup, and 
other forms of cookery ; they were highly esteemed by the 
Romans, as they are at present by the French, Italians, and 
other nations. Pliny exclaims against the luxury of his 
countrymen in this article, wonders what extraordinary plea- 
sure there can be in eating such dangerous food. The an- 
cient writers on the Materia Medica seem to agree, that mush- 
rooms are in general unwholesome ; and the moderns, Le- 
mery, Allen, Geoffroy, Boerhaave, Linnseus, and others, con- 
cur in the same opinion. There are numerous instances on 
record of their fatal effects, and almost all authors agree, that 
they are fraught with poison. 

The common esculent kinds, if eaten too freely, frequently 
bring on heart-burns, sicknesses, vomitings, diarrhoeas, dy- 
senteries, and other dangerous symptoms. It is therefore to 
be wished, that they were banished from the table; but, if the 
palate must be indulged in these treacherous gratifications, 
or, as Seneca calls them, this voluptuous poison, it is neces- 
sary that those, who are employed in collecting them, should 
be extremely cautious, lest they should collect such as are ab- 
solutely pernicious ; which, considering to whose care this is 
generally committed, may, and undoubtedly frequently has 
happened. The eatable mushrooms at first appear of a roun- 
dish form, like a button ; the upper part and the stalk are very 
thin ; the under part is of a livid flesh colour; but the fleshy 
part, when broken, is very white. When these are suffered 



366 APPENDIX. 

to remain undisturbed, they will grow to a large size, and ex 
pand themselves almost to a flatness, and the red part under- 
neath will change to a dark colour. 

Small Hemlock, though it seems not to be of so virulent a 
nature as the larger hemlock, yet Boerhaave places it among 
the vegetable poisons, in his Institutes ; and in his History of 
Plants, he produces an instance of its pernicious effects. It 
is therefore necessary to guard against it, in collecting herbs 
for sallads and other purposes. Attend therefore to the fol- 
lowing description : 

The first leaves are divided into numerous small parts, 
which are of a pale green, oval, pointed, and deeply indent- 
ed. The stalk is slender, upright, round, striated, and about 
a yard high. The flowers are white, growing at the tops of 
the branches in little umbels. It is an annual plant, common 
in orchards and kitchen gardens, and flowers in June and 
July. This plant has been often mistaken for parsley, and 
from thence it has received the name of fool's parsley. 

The water distilled from the leaves of the common laurel, 
has been frequently mixed with brandy, and other spirituous 
liquors, in order to give them the flavour of ratafia; and the 
leaves are often used in cookery, to communicate the same 
kind of taste to creams, custards, puddings, and some sorts of 
sweetmeats. But in the year 1728, an account of two women 
dying suddenly in Dublin, after drinking some of the com- 
mon distilled laurel water, gave rise to several experiments, 
made upon dogs, with the distilled water, and with the infu- 
sion of the leaves of the common laurel, communicated by 
Dr. Madden, Physician at Dublin, to the Royal Society in 
London ; and afterwards repeated, in the year 1T3 1, and con- 
firmed by Dr. Mortimer, by which it appeared, that both the 
water and the infusion brought on convulsions, palsy, and 
death. 

The laurel of the ancients, or the bay, is, on the contrary, 
of a salutary nature, and of use in several disorders ; but the 
common laurel is a plant of a very destructive kind, and, taken 
in a large quantity, is a most formidable poison. However, 
if it be administered with proper caution, and in small pro- 
portion, the leaves of the plant are generally thought to be 
innocent ; and therefore, for kitchen purposes, as the flavour- 
ing of custards, and such like, the use, in guarded and com- 
mon moderation, may be continued in perfect safety. The 
bitter parts of the plants, in which all the noxious properties 
are supposed to reside, are determined to be the same in qua- 
lity, and not sensibly different in degree, from the bitter al- 
mond, or from the kernels of any of the stoned fruits Lin- 



APPENDIX. 367 

Maeus says, that in Holland, an infusion of this kind of laurel is 
used in the practice of the healing art. Miller also says, that 
laurel leaves are perfectly innocent. A nice attention, how- 
ver, is certainly necessary in the use of them. 



SECTION II. 



CONSIDERATIONS ON THE ADULTERATION 
OF BREAD AND FLOUR. 

IN the adulteration of flour, mealmen and bakers have been 
known to use bean-meal, chalk, whiting, slacked lime, alum, 
and even ashes of bones. The first, bean-flour, is perfectly 
innocent, and affords a nourishment equal to that of wheat ; 
but there is a roughness in bean-flour, and its colour is dusky. 
To remove these defects, chalk is added to whiten it ; alum to 
give the whole compound that consistence which is necessary 
to make it knead well with the dough ; and jalap to take off 
the astringency. Some people may suppose, that these horrid 
iniquities are only imaginary, or at least exaggerated, and that 
such mixtures must be discoverable even by the most ordi- 
nary taste ; but, as some adulterations of this nature, have 
certainly been practised, the following experiments may serve 
to gratify curiosity, or discover frauds, where any such have 
been committed. 

To detect the adulteration of flour with whiting or chalk, 
mix it with some juice of lemon or good vinegar. If the flour 
be pure, they will remain together at rest; but if there be a 
mixture of whiting or chalk, a fermentation, like the working 
of yeast, will ensue. The adulterated meal is whiter and 
heavier than the good; the quantity that an ordinary tea-dish 
will contain, has been found to weigh more than the same 
quantity of genuine flour, by four drachms and nineteen 
grains Troy. 

The regular method of detecting these frauds in bread is 
thus: cut the crumb of a loaf into very thin slices; break 
them, but not into very small pieces, and put them into a glass 
cucurbit, with a large quantity of water. Set this, without 
shaking, in a sand furnace, and let it stand, with a moderate 
warmth, twenty-four hours. The crumb of the bread will, in 
this time, soften in all its parts, and the ingredients will sepa- 
rate from it. The alum will dissolve in the water, and may be 



368 APPENDIX. 

extracted from it in the usual way. The jalap, if any has been 
used, will swim upon the top in a coarse film ; and the other 
ingredients, being heavy, will sink to the bottom. This is the 
best and most regular method of finding the deceit ; but as 
cucurbites and sand furnaces are not at hand in private fami- 
lies, the following is a more familiar method : Slice the crumb 
of a loaf as before directed, and put it with a great deal of 
water into a large earthen pipkin. Set this over a gentle fire, 
and keep it a long time moderately hot. Then pour off the 
pap, and the bone ashes, or other ingredients, will be found 
at the bottom. 

Having spoken thus much of the adulteration of wbeat and 
bread, and as the business of baking often falls under the in- 
spection of the housekeeper, particularly in country resi- 
dences, we shall here give instructions for that purpose, 

To make White Bread in the London Manner. 

PUT a bushel of the finest well-dressed flour in at one end 
of the kneading trough ; then take a gallon of water, which 
bakers call liquor, and some yeast : stir it into the liquor till 
it looks of a good brown colour, and begins to curdle. Strain 
and mix it with the flour till it is about the thickness of a 
seed cake, then cover it with the lid of the trough, and let it 
stand three hours. As soon as it begins to fall, take a gallon 
more of liquor, weigh three quarters of a pound of salt, and 
with the hand mix it well with water. Strain it, and with this 
liquor make the dough of a moderate thickness, fit to make 
up into loaves. Then cover it again with the lid, and let it 
stand three hours more. In the mean time put the wood into 
the oven, which will require two hours heating. Then clear 
the oven, and begin to make the bread; put it in, close up 
the oven, and three hours will bake it. When once the bread 
is put in, the oven must not be opened till the bread is baked; 
and take care in summer that the water is milk warm, and in 
winter as hot as the finger will bear. All flour does not re- 
quire the same quantity of water ; but that experience will 
teach in two or three times making. 

To make Leaven Bread. 

BREAD made without barm, must be by the assistance of 
leaven. Take a lump of dough, about two pounds of the 
last making, which has been raised by barm. Keep it in a 
wooden vessel, cover it well with flour, and this will be the 
leaven. The night before baking, put the leaven to a peck 
of flour, and work them well together with warm water. Let 
it lie in a dry wooden vessel, well covered with a linen cloth 



APPENDIX. 369 

and blanket, and keep it in a warm place. This dough, kept 
warm, will rise again next morning, and will be sufficient to 
mix with two or three bushels of flour, being mixed up with 
warm water and a little salt. When it is well " orked up, and 
thoroughly mixed with the flour, let it be well covered with 
the linen and blanket, until it begins to rise. Then knead it 
well, and work it up into bricks or loaves, making the loaves 
broa.i, and not so thick and high as is frequently done, by 
which means the bread will be better baked. Always keep 
two or more pounds of the dough of the last baking, well co- 
vered with flour, to make leaven to serve from one baking day 
to another; and t! e more leaven put to the flour, the lighter 
the bread will be. The fresher the leaven, the less sour will 
be the bread. 

To make French Bread. 

PUT a pint of milk into three quarts of water; in winter, 
let it be scalding hot, but only little more than milk-warm in 
summer. Having put in salt sufficient to the taste, take a 
pint and a half of good ale yeast ; but take care that it is not 
bitter. Lay it in a gallon of water the night before ; pour it 
off the water, stir the yeast into the milk and water, and then 
with the hand break in a little more than a quarter of a pound 
of butter. Work it well till it is dissolved, then beat up two 
eggs in a bason, and stir them in. Take about a peck and a 
half of flour, and mix it with the liquor. In winter, the 
dough must be made pretty stiff, but more slack in summer ; 
to use a little more or less flour, according to the stiffness of 
the dough ; but mind to mix it well, and the less it is worked, 
the better. Stir the liquor into the flour as for pie crust; and 
after the dough is made, cover it with a cloth, and let it lie to 
rise while the oven is heating. When they have lain in a 
quick oven about a quarter of an hour, turn them on the other 
side, and let them lie about a quarter longer. Then take 
them out, and chip all the French bread with a knife, which 
will be better than rasping it, making it look spongy, and of 
a fine yellow; whereas the rasping takes off that fine colour, 
and makes it look too smooth. 

To make Oat-Cakes and Muffins. 

TAKE a pint and a half of good ale yeast from pale malt, 
because that is whitest. Let the yeast lie in water all night, 
the next day pour off the water clear, make two gallons of 
water just milk-warm, but not so hot as to scald the yeast, 
and two ounces of salt. Mix the water, yeast, and salt well 
together for a quarter of an hour. Then strain it, and with a 
bushel of Hertfordshire white flour mix up the dough as light

as possible, and let it lie in the trough an hour to rise. Then 
roll it with the hand, and pull it into little pieces about as big 
as a large walnut. Roll them with the hand in the shape of a 
ball, lay them on a table, and as fast as they are done, lay a 
piece of flannel over them, and be sure to keep the dough co- 
vered with flannel. When all the dough is rolled out, begin 
to bake the first made, and by that time they will be spread 
out in a right form. Lay them on the iron, and as soon as 
one side is sufficiently coloured, turn them on the other ; but 
take great care that they do not burn, or be too much disco- 
loured. If the iron is too hot, as will sometimes be the case, 
put a brick-bat or two in the middle of the fire to slacken 
the heat. Here it is undoubtedly necessary to mention in 
what manner the thing baked on must be made. Build a 
place as if going to set a copper; but instead of a copper, 
place a piece of iron all over the top, in form just the same 
as the bottom of an iron pot, and make the fire underneath 
with coal, as in a copper. Observe, that muffins are made 
the same way, with this difference only, that, when pulled 
to pieces, roll them in a good deal of flour, and with a roll- 
ing pin roll them thin. Then cover them with a piece of 
flannel, and they will rise to a proper thickness ; but, if too 
big or too little, roll the dough accordingly. Muffins must not 
be the least discoloured. 

To "preserve Yeast. 

TAKE a quantity of it, stir and work it well with a whisk 
until it becomes liquid and thin. Then get a large wooden 
platter, cooler, or tub, clean and dry, and with a soft brusli 
lay a thin layer of yeast on the tub, and turn the mouth down- 
wards, that no dust may fall upon it, but so that the air may 
get under to dry it. When that coat is very dry, then lay on 
another, and so on till two or three inches thick, always taking 
care that the yeast is very dry in the tub before laying any 
more on, and this will keep good for several months. To use 
this yeast, cut a piece off, and lay it into warm water ; stir it 
together, and it will be fit for use. If for brewing, take a large 
handful of birch tied together, dip it into the yeast, and hang 
it up to dry. In this manner do any number; but take care 
no dust comes to it. When the beer is fit to set to work, throw 
in one of these, and it will make it work as well as yeast. 

To make Yeast. 

Mix two quarts of soft water with wheat flour, to the con- 
sistence of thick gruel, or soft hasty pudding ; boiled gently 
for half an hour, and when almost cold, stir it into half a pound 
of sugar, and four spoonsful of good yeast. Put it into a large 



APPENDIX. 311 

jug, or earthen vessel with a narrow top, and place it before 
the fire, so that it may by a moderate heat ferment. The fer- 
mentation will throw up a thin liquor, which pour off and throw- 
away ; the remainder may be used instead of common yeast, 
and four spoonsful will make a fresh quantity as before : keep 
it in a bottle in a cool place. 



SECTION III. 

PROPER NOURISHMENT FOR THE SICK. 

Mutton Broth. 

\ AKE the fat off a pound of loin of mutton, and put the learr 
into a quart of water; skim it well as it boils, and put in a 
piece of the upper crust of bread, with a large blade of mace. 
Having covered it up close, let it boil slowly for half an hour, 
and then pour the broth clear off without stirring it : skim off 
the fat, season it with a little salt, and the meat will be in a pro- 
per state to be eaten. Some boil turnips with the meat : but 
this should not be done, as they ought to be boiled by them- 
selves. 

Beef or mutton broth for very weak people, who cannot 
digest much nourishment: Take a pound of beef or mutton, 
or both together, and put to each pound a quart of water. 
Skin the meat and take off the fat, cut it into little pieces, and 
let it boil till it comes to a quarter of a pint. Then season it 
with a very little salt, skim off all the fat, and give the sick per- 
son a spoonful of it at a time. If the sick person be very weak, 
even half a spoonful will be enough at once; while to others 
who are stronger, a tea-cupful may be given at a time ; in- 
deed the whole is, properly to observe what quantity the 
stomach of the sick person will bear. 

Beef Broth. 

TAKE off the fat and skin of a pound of lean beef, and cut 
it into pieces. Then put it into a gallon of water, with the 
under crust of a penny loaf, and a very little salt. Let it boil 
till it is reduced to two quarts, then strain it off, and it will 
be very nourishing. 

Beef Tea. > 

TAKE a piece of lean beef, cut it cross and cross, and then 

pour on it scalding water. Cover it up close, and let it stand 

till it is cold. Then pour it off as wanted, season it mode- 

fately, and give it to the sick person, having first warmed it. 

Or, cut a pound of lean beef very fine, pour a pint of boil- 

BB 2 



372 APPENDIX. 

ing water over it, and put it on the fire to raise the scum. 
Skim it clean, strain it off, and let it settle. Pour it clean 
from the settling, and then it will be fit for use. 

Essence of eef, or Mutton. 

TAKE two pounds of either, cut into very small pieces ; put 
aside all fat and skin, and lay the meat in a jug without any 
water; put the jug into a deep saucepan, and pour round it a 
sufficient quantity of water to come up to the neck: let the 
jug boil in the water two hours; take it out, pour the es- 
sence into a basin ; when cold, skim off the fat, and warm the 
remainder of the essence by plunging the basin into hot 
water : a single tea-spoonful at a time sufficient. 

^ Veal Broth. 

TAKE two pounds of scrag of veal, and put to it two quarts 
of water, a large piece of upper crust of bread, two blades of 
mace, and a little parsley tied with a thread. Cover it close, 
let it boil two hours very slowly, observing to skim it occa- 
sionally, when both meat arid broth will be ready. 

To mince Veal or Chicken. 

MINCE some veal or. a chicken very fine; but first take off 
the skin ; just boil as much water as will moisten it, and no 
more, with a very little salt, and some nutmeg grated. Then 
throw a little flour over it, and when the water boils, put in 
the meat. Keep shaking it about for a minute over the fire; 
then have ready two or three thin sippets, toasted nice and 
brown, laid in the plate, and pour the mince-meat over it. 

Pork Broth. 

TAKE off the skin and fat from two pounds of young pork, 
boil it in a gallon of water, with a turnip and a very little salt, 
till it is reduced to two quarts: strain it off, and let it stand till 
cold. Take off the fat, leave the settling at the bottom of the 
pan, and drink half a pint warmed in the morning fasting, an 
hour before breakfast, and at noon, provided the stomach will 
bear it. 

To pull a Chicken. 

TAKE any quantity of cold chicken, take off the skin, and 
pull the meat into little bits as thick as a quill ; then take the 
bones, boil them with a little salt till they are good, and strain. 
Then take a spoonful of the liquor, a spoonful of milk, a little 
bit of butter as big as a large nutmeg, rolled in flour, a little 
chopped parsley, as much as will lie upon a sixpence, and a 
little salt, if wanted. This will be enough for half a small 
chicken. Put all together into the saucepan, then keep shak- 
ing it till it is thick, and pour it into a hot plate. 



APPENDIX. 313 

Chicken Broth. 

, FLAY an old cock or a large fowl, pick off all the fat, and 
break the bones to pieces with a rolling pin; put it into two 
quarts of water, with a large crust of bread and a blade of 
mace : let it boil softly till it is good, which will probably re- 
quire five or six hours. Pour it off, then put to it a quart 
more of boiling water, and cover it close; let it boil softly till 
good, then strain it off, and season it with a very little salt. 

Or, having boiled a chicken save the liquor, and when the meat 
is eaten, break the bones, and put them to the liquor in which 
the chicken was boiled, with a blade of mace, and a crust of 
bread. Let it boil till it is good, and then strain it off. 

Or, let the saucepan be very clean and nice, and when the 
water boils, put in the chicken, which must be very nicely 
picke-i and cleaned, and laid in cold water a quarter of an, 
hour before boiling it. Then take it out of the boiling water 
and lay it in a dish. Save all the liquor that runs from it in the 
dish, cut up the chicken all in joints in the same dish, bruise 
the liver very fine, add a little boiled parsley finely chopped, 
a very little salt, and a little grated nutmeg. Mix all well 
together with two spoonsful or the liquor of the fowl, and 
pour it into the dish with the rest of the liquor. If there 
be not liquor enough, take two or three spoonsful of the 
liquor it was boiled in, and clap another dish over it. Then 
set it over a chafing-dish of hot coals for five or six minutes, 
and carry it to table hot with the cover on. If it is for a weak 
person, take off the skin of the chicken before setting it on the 
chafing-dish ; and if roasted, make nothing but bread sauce, 
which is the lightest sauce for a sick person. In this manner 
dress a rabbit, excepting that only a piece of the liver must 
be bruised. 

Chicken Water. 

FLAY a large fowl or a cock, bruise the bones with a ham- 
mer, and put it into a gallon of water with a crust of bread. 
Let it boil half away, and then strain it off for use. 

Bread Soup. 

SET a quart of water on the fire in a clean saucepan, and 
as much dry crust of bread cut to pieces as the top of a penny 
loaf, the drier the better, with a bit of butter as big as a wal- 
nut. Let it boil, then beat it with a spoon, and keep boiling 
it, till the bread and water are well mixed. Then season it 
with a very little salt, and it will be very agreeable to a weak 
stomach. 

Buttered Water. 

BEAT up the yolk of an egg in a pint of water, put in a 
piece of butter as big as a small walnut, with two or three 



374 APPENDIX. 



knobs of sugar, and keep stirring it all the time it is on the 
fire. When it begins to boil, bruise it between the saucepan 
and a mug, till it is smooth, and has a great froth, when it 
will be fit to drink. It is ordered in a cold, and where eggs 
will agree with the stomach. This is called egg-soup by the 
Germans, who are very fond of it for supper. 

Seed Water. 

BRUISE half a spoonful of carraway seeds, and a spoonful 
of coriander seeds. Boil them in a pint of water, then strain 
them, and beat into them the yolk of an egg. Mix it up 
with some white wine, and sweeten it to the taste with double- 
refined sugar. 

Barley Water. 

BOIL a quarter of a pound of pearl barley in two quarts of 
water, skim it very clean, and when it has boiled half away, 
strain it. Make it moderately sweet, and put in two spoonsful 
of white wine. It must be made a little warm before drink, 
ing it. 

To boil Pigeons. 

HAVING cleaned, washed, drawn, and skinned the pigeons, 
boil them in milk and water for ten minutes, and pour over 
them the following sauce : Parboil the livers, and bruise them 
fine, with an equal weight of parsley boiled and chopped tine. 
Melt some butter, first mix a little of it with the liver and pars- 
ley, them mix all together, and pour it over the pigeons. 

To boil Partridges. 

PUT the partridge into boiling water, and let it boil ten 
minutes ; then take it up into a plate, and cut it into two, 
laying the inside next the plate. Take the crumb of a half- 
penny roll, or thereabout, and with a blade of mace, boil 
it two or three minutes. Pour away most of the water, then 
beat it up with a small piece of good butter and a little salt, 
and pour it over the partridge. Put a cover over it, and set 
it over a chafing-dish of coals four or five minutes, and send 
it up hot, covered close. In this manner dress any sort of wild 
fowl, only boiling it more or less according to its size. Before 
pouring bread sauce over ducks, take off the skins ; and if 
roasted, lay bread sauce under them, which is much lighter 
for weak stomachs than gravy. 

To boil Plaice or Flounders. 

THROW some salt into water, and when it boils, put in the 
fish ; as soon as they are enough, take them out, and let them 
remain a little time on the slice to drain : take two spoonsful 



APPENDIX. 375 

of the liquor, with a little salt, and a little grated nutmeg ; 
then beat up the yolk of an egg well with the liquor, and stir 
in the egg. Beat it well together. With a knife carefully 
slice away all the little bones round the fish, and pour the 
sauce over it. Then set it for a minute over a chafing-dish of 
coals, and send it up hot. 

Brown Caudle. 

PUT four spoonsful of oatmeal, a blade or two of mace, and 
a piece of lemon peel, into two quarts of water ; boil it about 
a quarter of an hour, but take care that it does not boil over : 
then strain it, and add a quart of good ale that is not bitter. 
Sweeten it to the palate, arid add half a pint of white wine, 
or a glass of brandy. When you do not put in white wine or 
brandy, the caudle must be half of it ale. 

White Caudle. 

MAKE gruel as above, and strain it through a sieve, but put 
no ale to it ; when used, sweeten it to the palate, grate in a 
little nutmeg, and put in what white wine you think proper. 
If it be not for a sick person, squeeze in the juice of a lemon. 

Water Gruel. 

PUT a large spoonful of oatmeal into a pint of water, stir it 
well together, and let it boil three or four times, stirring it 
often. Then strain it through a sieve, salt it to the palate, 
and put in a large piece of fresh butter. Brew it with a spoon 
till the butter is all melted, and it will be then fine and smooth. 

Panada. 

PUT a blade of mace, a large piece of the crumb of bread, 
and a quart of water, into a clean saucepan. Let it boil two 
minutes, then take out the bread, and bruise it very fine in a 
bason. Mix as much water as it will require, pour away the 
rest, and sweeten it to the palate. Put in a piece of butter as 
big as a walnut, but do not put in any wine, as that will spoil 
it. Grate in a little nutmeg. 

Isinglass Jelly. 

PUT an ounce of isinglass, and half an ounce of cloves, into 
a quart of water. Boil it to a pint, strain it upon a pound of 
loaf sugar, and when cold, sweeten your tea with it. You 
may add a little wine. Jellies made from calf's feet, and 
other things, have been already given. 

Salop. 

TAKE a large tea-spoonful of the powder of salop, and 
put it into a pint of boiling water. Stir it till it is a fine jelly, 
and then put in wine and sugar to the palate. 



376 APPENDIX- 



Artificial Asses Milk. 

TAKE two large spoonsful of hartshorn shavings, two ounces 
of pearl barley, an ounce of eringo root, the same quantity 
of China root, the same of preserved ginger, and eighteen 
snails bruised with the shells ; boil them in three quarts of 
water tiil it comes to three pints : then boil a pint of new milk, 
mix it with the rest, and put in two ounces of balsam of Tolu. 
Take half a pint in the morning, and half a pint at night. 

Or, take a quart of milk, set it in a pan over night, and the 
next morning take off all the cream ; then boil it, and set it in 
the pan again till night: then boil it, set it in the pan again, 
and the next morning skim it. Make it blood warm, and 
drink it as asses milk. 

Or, take a quart of milk, and a quart of water, with the top- 
crust of a penny loaf, and a blade of mace. Boil it a quarter 
of an hour ver/'softly, then pour it off, and drink it warm. 



SECTION IV. 

NECESSARY ARTICLES* FOR SEAFARING 
PERSONS. 

As pickled mushrooms are very handy for captains of ships 
to take with them to sea, we shall here give directions for 
that particular purpose. Wash the mushrooms clean, with a 
piece of flannel dipped in salt and water, put them into a 
saucepan, and throw a little salt ovr them. Let them boil 
up tlnee times in their own liquor, then throw them into a 
sieve to drain, and spread them on a clean cloth. Let them 
lie till they are cold, then put them into wide-mouthed bot- 
tles, with a good deal of whole mace, a little nutmeg sliced, 
and a few cloves. Boil the vinegar, with a good deal of whole 
pepper, some races of ginger, and two or three bay leaves ; 
let it boil a few minutes, then strain it, and when it is cold, 
put it, on, and fill the bottles with mutton fat fried. Cork 
them, tie a bladder, then a leather over them, and keep them 
down close, in as cool a place as possible. 

Or, take large mushrooms, peel them, and scrape out the 
inside. Then put them into a saucepan, throw a little salt 
over them, and let them boil in their own liquor. Then throw 



APPENDIX, Sf? 

them into a sieve to drain, lay them on tin plates, and set 
theni in a cool oven. Repeat it often till they are perfectly 
dry, then put them into a clean stone jar, tie them down tight, 
and keep them in a dry place. They will keep a great while, 
and eat and look as well as truffles. 

Ketchup to keep twenty years. 

TAKE a gallon of strong stale beer, a pound of anchovies 
washed from the pickle, the same quantity of shalots peeled, 
half an ounce of mace, half an ounce of cloves, a quarter of 
an ounce of whole pepper, three or four large races of gin- 
ger, and two quarts of large mushroom flaps rubbed to pieces. 
Cover all this close, and let it simmer till it is half wasted. 
Then strain it through a flannel bag, let it stand till quite cold, 
and then bottle it. This may be carried to any part of the 
world ; and a spoonful of it to a pound of fresh butter melted, 
will make a fine fish sauce, or will supply the place of gravy 
sauce. The stronger and staler the beer, the better will be the 
ketchup. 

Fish Sauce. 

THE following fish sauce, though it will not keep more 
than a year, may be very useful in short voyages : Chop 
twenty-four anchovies, having first boned them ; put to them 
ten shalots cut small, and a handful of scraped horse-radish, 
a quarter of an ounce of mace, a quart of white wine, a pint 
of water, and the same quantity of red wine ; a lemon cut 
into slices, half a pint of anchovy liquor, twelve cloves, and 
the same number of pepper corns. Boil them together till 
it comes to a quart, then strain it off, cover it close, and keep 
it in a cold dry place. Two spoonsful of it will be sufficient 
for a pound of butter. It is a pretty sauce for boiled fowls 
and many other things, or in the room of gravy, lower i no- it 
with hot water, and thickening it with a piece of butter rolled 
in flour. 

Dripping. 

DRIPPIN T G will be very useful at sea, to frv fish or meat, and 
for this purpose it must be thus potted : Take six pounds of 
good beef drijpping, boil it in some soft water, strain it into 
a pan, and let it stand till it is cold. Then take off the hard 
fat, and scrape off the gravy which sticks to the inside. Do 
this eight times, and when it is cold and hard, take it off 
clean from the water, and put it into a large saucepan, with 
six bay-leaves, twelve cloves, half a pound of salt, and a quar- 
ter of a pound of whole pepper. Let the fat be all melted 



378 APPENDIX. 

and just hot enough to strain through a sieve into the pot. 
Then let it stand till it is quite cold, and cover it up. The 
best way to keep any sort of dripping, is to turn the pot up- 
side down, and then no rats can get at it. It will keep on 
shipboard, and make as fine puff paste crust as any butter 
whatever, for pies or puddings. 

Directions for steeping dried Fish. 

EVERY kind of fish, except stock-fish, are salted, or either 
dried in the sun, as the most common way, or in preparing 
kilns, and sometimes by the smoke of wood fires in chimney- 
corners, and, in either case, require being softened and fresh- 
ened in proportion to their bulk, their nature, or dryness. The 
very dry sort, as bacalao, cod fish, or whiting, and such like, 
should oe steeped in luke-warm milk and water, and the steep- 
ing kept as nearly as possible to an equal degree of heat. The 
larger fish should be steeped twelve hours ; the small, such as 
whitings, &c. about two hours. The cod are therefore laid to 
steep in the evening ; the whitings, &c. in the morning before 
they are to be dressed. After the time of steeping they are to 
be taken out, and hung up by the tails until they are dressed. 
The reason of hanging them up is, that they soften equally as 
in the steeping, without extracting too much of the relish, 
which would make them insipid. When thus prepared, the 
small fish, as whitings, tusk, and such like, must be floured and 
lard on the gridiron, and when a little hardened on one side, 
must be turned and basted with oil upon a feather; and when 
basted on both sides, and heated through, take them up, 
always observing, that as sweet oil supples and supplies the 
fish with a kind of artificial juices, so the fire draws out these 
juices and hardens them. Therefore be careful not to let 
them broil too long; but no time can be prescribed, because 
of the difference of fires, and various sizes of the fish. A 
clear charcoal fire is much the best, and the fish kept at a 
good distance, to broil gradually. The best way to know 
when they are enough is, they will swell a little in the basting, 
and you must not let them fall again. 

The sauces are the same as usual to salt fish ; and the usual 
garnish, oysters fried in batter ; but for a supper, for those 
that like sweet oil, the best sauce is oil, vinegar, and mustard, 
beat up to a consistence, and served up in a boat. 

Should your fish be boiled, as those of a large sort usually 
are, it should be in milk and water, but not properly to say 
boiled, as it should only just simmer over an equal fire; in 
which way, half an hour will do the largest fish, and five mi- 
nutes the smallest. Some people broil both sorts after sim- 
mering, and some pick them to pieces and then toss them up 



APPENDIX. 373 

in a pan .with fried onions and apples. They are either way 
very good, and the choice depends on the weak or strong 
stomach of the eaters. 

Dried Salmon. 

DRIED salmon must be managed in a different manner; for 
though a large fish, they do not require more steeping than a 
whiting ; and should be moderately peppered when laid on the 
gridiron. 

Dried Herrings. 

DRIED herrings should he steeped the like time as the 
whiting, in small beer instead of milk and water ; and to 
which, as to all kinds of broiled salt fish, sweet oil will always 
be found the best basting, and no ways effect even the deli- 
cacy of those who do not Jove it. 



SECTION V. 

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON 

THE BREEDING OF POULTRY. 

W HILE families remain in the country, it will sometimes be 
expected of the housekeeper, that she should know some- 
thing of the management of poultry. We shall therefore ap- 
propriate a section to that purpose, in which we shall lay down 
some general rules for that business. These hints may like- 
wise be equally useful to those small families, who retire from 
the noise and bustle of large towns and populous cities, to 
spend the evening of their lives amidst the tranquillity of rural 
scenes. 

Fowls. 

IN the first place, particular care must be taken that the 
hen-roost be kept clean. Do not choose too large a breed 
as they generally eat coarse ; and six hens to a cock will be 
a good proportion. When fowls are near laying, o-ive them 
whole rice, or nettle seed mixed with bran and bread, worked 
into a paste. In order to make your fowls familiar, feed them 
at particular hours, and always in one place. 



380 APPENDIX. 

Great care must be taken to keep your storehouse free from 
vermin, and contrive your perches so as not to be over one 
another, nor over the nests, in which always take care to 
keep clean straw. Wherever poultry are kept, all sorts of 
vermin will naturally come ; for which reason it would be 
proper to sow wormwood and rue about the places in which 
you keep them, and you may also l^pil wormwood, and sprin- 
kle the floor with it, which will nobf ; only contribute to keep 
away vermin, but also add much to tne health of your poultry. 
As to rats, mice, and weasels, the best method is to set traps 
for them. 

If you feed your hens now and then with barley bruised, 
and with the toasts taken out of ale, they will lay often, and 
all the winter. To prevent your hens eating their own eggs, 
which they sometimes will, lay a piece of chalk cut like an 
egg, at which they will often be pecking, and thus finding 
themselves disappointed, they will not afterwards attempt it. 
When your hens are inclinable to sit, which you will know by 
their clucking, do not disappoint them, nor put more than ten 
under each. March is reckoned a good month to set hens in ; 
but if the}' be properly fed, they will lay many eggs, and set 
at any time. 

Ducks. 

DUCKS usually begin to lay in February ; and if your gar. 
dener be diligent in picking up snails, grubs, -caterpillars, 
worms, and other insects, and lay them in one place, it will 
make your ducks familiar, and is the best food, for change, you 
can give them. Parsley, sowed about the ponds or river 
they use, gives their flesh an agreeable taste j and be always 
sure to have one certain place for them constantly to retire to 
at night. Partition off their nests, and make them as near the 
water as possible. Always feed them there, as it makes them 
love home, ducks being of a rambling nature. Their eggs 
should be taken away till they are inclined to sit, and it is 
best for every duck, as well as every fowl, to sit upon her own 
eggs. 

Geese. 

THE keeping of geese is attended with little trouble ; but 
they spoil a deal .of grass, no creature choosing to eat after 
them. When the goslings are hatched, let them be kept 
within doors, and lettuce leaves and peas boiled in milk are 
very good for them. When they are about to lay, drive them 
to their nests, and shut them up, and set every goose with its 
own eggs, always feeding them at one place, and at stated 
times. They will feed upon all sorts of grain and grass ; and 



APPENDIX. 381 

you may gather acorns, parboil them in ale, and it will fatten 
them surprisingly. 

Turkeys. 

TURKEYS require more trouble to bring them up than com- 
mon poultry. The hen will lay till she is five years old. Be 
sure always to feed them^near the place where you intend 
they should lay, and feed'-them four or five times each day, 
they being great devourers. While they are sitting they must 
have plenty of victuals before them, and also be kept warm. 
To fatten them, you must give them sodden barley and sod- 
den oats, for the first fortnight, and then cram them as you 
do capons. 

Pigeons, 

IF you keep pigeons, which are generally hurtful to your 
neighbours, take care to feed them well, or you will lose 
them all. They are great devourers, and yield but little profit. 
Their nests should be made private and separate, or they will 
always disturb one another. Be sure to keep their house clean, 
and lay among their food some hempseed, of which they are 
great lovers. 

Rabbits. 

TAME rabbits are very fertile, bringing forth every month ; 
and as soon as they have kindled, put them to the buck, or 
they will destroy their young. The best food for them is the 
sweetest hay, oats, and bran, marsh mallows, sowthistle, pars- 
ley, cabbage-leaves, clover-grass, &c. always fresh. If you 
do not keep them clean, they will poison both themselves and 
those that look after them. 

Capons. 

THE best way to cram a capon or a turkey is, to take bar- 
ley meal properly sifted, and mix it with new milk. Make it 
into a good stiff dough paste ; then make it into long crams or 
rolls, big in the middle, and small at both ends. Then wetting 
them in lukewarm milk, give the capon a full gorge three times 
a day, morning, noon, and night, and in two or three weeks it 
will be as fat as necessary. In Norfolk, they use ground buck 
wheat instead of barley meal. 

Fowls are very liable to a disorder called the pip, which is a 
white thin scale growing on the tip of the tongue ; and will 
prevent poultry from feeding. This is easily discerned, and 
generally proceeds from drinking puddle water, or want of 
water, or eating filthy meat. This, however, may be cured, 



382 APPENDIX. 

by pulling off the souJe with your nail, and then rubbing the 
tongue with salt. 

The flux in poultry conies from their eating too much meat, 
and the cure is to give them peas and bran scalded. If your 
poultry be much troubled with lice (which is common, pro- 
ceeding from corrupt food, and other causes) , take pepper 
beaten small, mix it with warm water, wash your poultry with 
it, and it will kill all kinds of vermin. 

Rats and Mice Bait for. 

Mix flour of malt with tresh-butter, and add a few drops of 
oil of aniseed ; make into balls, and with them bait the 

traps. This bait has never been known to fail. 

* 

Rats To drive away. 

LAY birdlime in their haunts, for though nasty in other re- 
spects, yet being very curious of their fur, if it be but daubed 
with birdlime, it will be so troublesome to them, that they 
will even scratch oft the skin to get it off, and will never stay 
in a place where they have suffered in such a manner. 

Rats and Mice To destroy. 

IN or near the place frequented by these vermin, place on 
a slate or tile one or two table spoonsful of dry oatmeal: lay 
it thin, and press it flat, more easily to ascertain what is taken 
away. As the rats, if not interrupted, will come regularly 
there to feed, continue to supply them with fresh oatmeal for 
two or three days; and then well mixing, in about six table- 
spoonsful of dry oatmeal, three drops only of oil of ani- 
seed, ft-ed them with this for two or three days more : after- 
wards, for one day, give them only half the quantity of this 
scented oatmeal which they have before actually eaten ; and 
next day place the following mixture : to four ounces of dry 
oatmeal, scented with six drops of oil of aniseed, add half 
an ounce of carbonated barytes, previously pounded very fine 
in a mortar, and sifted through a 4ittle fine muslin or cam- 
bric. Mix this intimately with the scented oatmeal; and 
laying it on the tile or slate, allow the rats to eat it, without 
the smallest interruption for twenty-four hours ; and all those 
that have eaten any of it will inevitably be killed. The car- 
bonated barytes may be purchased of Brown and Ma\v, Ta- 
vistock Street ; Accum, Compton Street ; and Allen and 
Howard, Plough Court, Lombard Street, London.
