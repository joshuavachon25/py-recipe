PEEFACE. 



MAmr PEOPLE — after dining at a table served in 
superior style to their own, and while enjoying 
the easy digestion which is the combined result of 
good cookery, pure wine, and pleasant company 
— say to themselves resignedly : ' All this is very 
agreeable ; but it is quite out of the question for 
us. We have not the material, means, and ap- 
pliances to do it. We might as well attempt to 
grow hot-house grapes in the open air, in our 
little back-garden. It is useless to attempt it.' 
And the dinner remains a souvenir^ instead of 
serving as an example. 

Such despondent persons clearly make a mis- 
take as to what they may attempt, and what they 
may not. The extra ornamentation, the super- 
abundance of plate, the multitude of viands may 
well be let alone ; but the object of the following 
pages is to show that the real essentials of a 
good dinner, i.e. a few good dishes, may be had 
by those who have the courage to will it. To be 
convinced of this, the reader has only to study our 
chapter on bills of fare, and the receipts for the 
dishes composing them. They coniprise choice 
specimens both of British and continental cookery, 
and, on inspecting them coolly and carefully, it 



VI PREFACE. 

will be found that the difficulty of their execution 
is rather imaginary than real True, there are 
some that require to be seen dbne or shown ; but 
even our own plain cookery has its compUcations. 
George m. was puzzled to guess how ever the 
apple could get inside the dumpUng ; and the 
cook who dares face the preparation of Christmas 
plum pudding and hot mince pies, is a coward if 
she run away in terror from a vol-au-vent, or a 
calf's head ct la toriue. For those kinds of dishes 
it has been our endeavour to give a clear under- 
standing of their composition. 

Other points which we have been anxious to 
insist on are, the hygienic eflfects of cookery, and 
the relative value of the different kinds of food. 
On these we have enlarged more than some may 
think necessary ; after perusal, however, they wiU 
probably acknowledge that such topics are not 
only relevant, but highly important. 

Our readers will not feel offended at being 
reminded why some articles of diet are good, 
others indifferent, and others bad — that popular 
belief may be sometimes mistaken in the nutritive 
value it attributes to certain articles — ^that jellies 
and arrowroot pap are not nourishing, whUe pease 
soup and pudding, bean-flour, oatmeal CTuel, and 
dried haricots made into a stew decidedly are. 

Besides the passages relating to what may be 
fiiirly called the philosophy of cookery, it is hoped 
that useful suggestions will be found in the pages 
devoted to the sick, the sedentary, and the con- 
valescent That the reader may never want to 
turn to them is our hearty wish.

THE DOCTOR AND THE COOK. 



GENERALITIES. 

CONSIDERATIONS TOUCHING FOOD, AND ITS RELATIONS 

TO HEALTH. 

The Doctor, unsupported by the Cook's material aid, 
and the Cook, unguided by the Doctor's knowledge, are 
two powerful agents, half whose strength is paralysed or 
misdirected. Combine their lights and their resources, 
and you have at your command efficient means of allevi- 
ating or even curing numerous ills which flesh is heir to. 
If the Doctor and the Cook together can do nothing with 
a case, it is indeed past hope of recovery. We thereby 
receive an unmistakable warning that there is, in fact, a 
Law of Nature, to which we must all of us finally submit 
But so long as our term remains yet unexpired, wc 
naturally wish to enjoy both health and the allowable 
pleasures attendant on health, the value of which we 
apprecnate the more, the further we advance in years. 



2 CONSIDERATIONS TOUCHING FOOD, 

At forty, every man is either a fool or a physician ; 
at forty, therefore, every man is either a fool or else a 
little bit of a cook. By others' faults, wise men correct 
their own ; by listening to the complaints of others' indi- 
gestions, wise men will ward off attacks of indigestion 
in their own proper persons. Besides which, we have all 
of us « stomachs, on which we have been experimenting, 
more or less, during the lapse of forty long years. But 
all that is required to avoid gastronomic errors, and their 
consequent pains and penalties, is a knowledge of the 
principles of animal nutrition and cuUnaiy chemistry^ 

Food is taken in, in some shape, by all living crea- 
tures, for the purpose both of effecting growtli and of 
repairing loss or wear and tear of the bodily frame. 
No growth can take place without a proper supply of 
material. It is clear, therefore, that if a creature do not 
eat, it cannot grow. 

The same is true of wear and tear. We cannot even 
live without thereby consuming a portion of our stock 
of strengtL Every vital act is an expenditure of capital, 
which must be replaced by an adequate supply of food. 
If that food is not forthcoming, the constitution rapidly 
lapses into bankruptcy. 

If there existed some one article of food, a restora- 
tive for every form of exhaustion, a panacea for every 
degree of fatigue, the duties of the Doctor and tfae 
Cook would be wonderfully simplified.* It is the 

* Hippocrates and his followers beliered that there was a unique 
nutritiTe principle common to all articles of food— « single primitire 
alimentary element, identical throughout all nature^and tried hard 
to difcorer it. 



Ain> ITS BELATIOKS TO HEALTH. 8 

immense difference in the qualities of food^ and the 
diffisrent powers possessed bj individuals (according to 
their state of health, constitution, and circumstance) of 
extracting nutriment firom food, which make their task 
and their responsibilitj so heavy. 

It is needless to insist that Man's organisation is 
adapted to the consumption of both animal and vegetable 
food, thereby indicating the enormous range of his 
dietary. The celebrated Magendie proved by experiment 
that it is difficult to sustain life — at least in animals whose 
organs most resemble those of man — ^with one single kind 
of food taken alone during a certain lapse of time, even 
if highly nutritious in quality. ^^ A diversity and mul* 
tiplioiiy of aliments," he says, ^^ is a most important 
hygienic rule. It is, moreover, indicated by our natural 
instincts, as well as by the variations which the seasons 
bring about in the nature and kind of alimentary sub- 
stances." 

Animal food satisfies hunger more completely and 
fer a longer time than vegetables, for reasons which 
will be shortly given ; animal food is also more open 
to the attack of our digestive organs than vegetables, 
or, in other words, more readily excites the assimilating 
powers of the stomach. But, of whatever kind the food, 
much depends upon the mode of preparation— on thb 
C0OK£BT. A large proportion of the nutritious elements 
may be wasted and lost, or they may all be preserved. 
In good broths and soups, for instance, every thing 
is retained except the little that is removed as scum. 

Cookery acts on food by diminishing the firmnesa 



4 COKSmSBATIONS TOUCHING FOOD, 

and hardness of some articles, and by inoreasing it in 
others. It alters their flavour, their smell, their appear- 
ance, if?hich are sometimes repugnant to our senses. It 
deprives them of bitter, acrid principles, which might 
prove injurious to the stomach, or even to the whole 
economy. It heightens their savouriness, and increases 
their action by the addition of aromatic, pmigent, and 
stimulant ingredients. 

The best cookery in the world, says Ude, is worth- 
less without seajsoning. The precept is true as a general 
maxim; but it is impossible for any Cook-Book, ^ppecially 
one like the present, to specify the exact dosage of season- 
ing to be put into any dish, because not only tastes, but 
stomachs, difier as to the amount of salt and spice which 
suits them. The cook's practice must be guided by the 
habits and wishes of her employer, whose use of season- 
ings will depend upon considerations of health. At the 
outset, and till after-inquiry, she had better be light- 
handed with her spice ; many stomachs are deranged 
for days by an over-dose of pepper and cayenne. 

She should remember that even with high-seasoned 
dishes there ought to be a sliding-scale of strength, 
adapting the degree to different palates. Some persons 
like curry and mulligatawny more moderately flavoured 
than others, and find that it agrees with them better. 
She should also carefully mark the difference between 
a merely piquant dish and a curry, and between a curry 
and a devil. Some things even, as certain smoked and 
salted fish, require to be dqmvedy by steeping, of a 
portion of their seasoning, to make them palatable and 



AND ITS BEIATIONS TO HEALTH. 5 

wholesome food. The cook thus enlarges her employer's 
bill of fare by enabling him to partake of dishes he must 
otherwise renomioe through fear of indigestion or tor- 
menting thirst 

To many who cannot bear their habitual use, high- 
seasoned dishes, oecasianally and moderately enjoyed, 
render service. Numbers who could not take curry 
eveiy day find themselyes the better for a taste of it 
once a week or once a fortnight. Every one must judge 
of such points according to his own proper feelings. 
ISest day, or the day after, he will know to a cer- 
tainty whether such and such things have agreed with 
him. 

The cook's range of seasoning is considerable. By 
it is meant any solid substances or liquids which, 
mingled with articles of food, either increase their savour 
or modify and change their qualities. 

The effect of seasonings, taken in reasonable quan- 
tity, is to increase the digestibility of food. Tliey effect 
that object either by simply stimulating the mucous 
membrane of the stomach, exciting its capillary cir- 
culation and the secretion of its acid and mucous fluids ; 
or by giving a fillip to all the bodily functions, in such 
a way that its effects, general in themselves, become in 
their turn a cause of activity in the functions of the 
stomach. 

The privation of seasonings has for its effect the 
prolonged retention in the stomach of many relaxing 
and emollient substances which have little power to 
solicit the action of that organ. By seasoning certain 



6 COKSIDEBATIONS TOUCHING FOOD, 

aliments within dne limits, we do no more than copy 
Natmre, who renders fruit wholesome and agreeable by 
associating mucilage with acids, by combining certain 
forms of starch with sugar, as well as by the instinctive 
taste with which she inspires men and animals both for 
salt, in saline springs and shell-fish, and for ilie perfume 

Seasonings suit lymphatic temperaments, aged per- 
sons, men devoted to professions requiring great bodily 
or mental exertion ; they are not suited to sanguine or 
bilious subjects, to children, and still less to infants, and 
scarcely to persons in the prime of life. They should be 
abstained from by nursing mothers, because the exciting 
effects of these substances may be transmitted to the 
deUcate organs of their babes. 

The immoderate use of seasonings has for its result 
'-first, Uie productibn of an artificial appetite, the temp- 
tation to load the stomach with more food than it can 
properly digest, and, consequently, by overtaxing that 
organ's powers (even when they do not directly cause 
it by their stimulant action on its membrane), either 
acute or chronic irritation ; secondly, it is sui*e to bring 
on in the end languor and debility in all the functions, 
premature decay of all the organs. 

The above remarks, however, are not intended to 
apply to certain substances which custom includes in 
the list of seasonings, but which, although they may 
alter the flavour of food, do not increase its digestibility. 
They even retain, when used, so long as they are un- 
altered in themselves, the relaxing qualities which are 



AND ITS RELATIOKS TO HEALTH. 7 

natnrallj proper to them. Instances to the point are 
afforded by batter, cream, oO, &c. 

Sugar not only seasons tasteless things, but also affords 
nutriment. Combined with insipid articles of food in 
moderate doses, it slightly stimulates the stomach and 
hastens digestion. Taken alone and in larger quantities, 
it produces an impression of warmth at the back of the 
throat and in the stomach. It leaves little residue in 
the intestines, and supplies the chyle with a consider- 
able proportion of fibrine. Dogs fed with sugar only 
have lived from tliirty to forty days. Sugar is almost 
always associated in nature with principles which 
neutralise its slightly heating and astringent properties ; 
so that the aliments in which sugar is naturally met 
with — vegetables, mucilaginous substances, and fruits 
— ^are precisely those which we have recourse to as 
mild, refreshing, and even slightly laxative. 

Sugar renders more digestible watery and insipid 
vegetables, such as green peas, spinach, cooked endive, 
^, and the starchy matters which enter broths and 
gruels. It tempers the acidity of certain fruits, and, 
when employed in sudi small quantities as to be unsus- 
pected, it softens as well as heightens the flavour of 
many savoury satices and roffodts. So employed, it forms 
a connecting and harmonising link between the sharpness 
of salt and the pungency of spice. Sugar is suitable to every 
temperament, to every climate, sex, and age. It is almost 
the only seasoning allowable to persons whose system is 
suffering from irritation, such as convalescents recovering 
from inflammation of the stomach, bowels, lungs, &c 



8 CONSIDKRATIONS TOUCHING FOOD, 

Honey is ihe natural sugar collected by bees from 
flowers and the leaves of certain plants. As a general 
rule, it is both less digestive and less digestible than 
sugar — ^in many cases even causing flatulence and 
diarrhoea. It varies greatly, according to the localiiy of 
its production, in colour, and in the aromatic principles 
contained in it. There are even flowers, as the kalmia, 
which are reputed to yield poisonous honey. It cannot 
in any way serve as a substitute for sugar ; but may be 
used with caution in sundry ways, as a varieiy and 
supplementary addition to it On Swiss tables, the 
honey-pot is a standing dish ; but, after a few trials, the 
majority of strangers leave it in the class of " Touch- 
me-nots." 

Oily though not a seasoning proper, can hardly be 
allowed to pass without notice. Tlie best eating oil is 
that obtained from olives ; its consumption is enormous 
throughout the countries where the olive-tree grows. 
The best olive-oil finds its way to England. It should 
be clear, greenish, with but little smell; such oil is 
pleasant on the palate, and light on the stomacL Its 
addition increases the nutritive qualities of fish, salad, 
cucumber, vegetable soups, cold boiled vegetables, &c. 
So mixed up, it communicates to food nothing more 
than a soft, pleasant flavour, and emollient properties. 
In 1u>t countries, it replaces butter out of sheer necessity. 
The prejudice against good eating oil, entertained by 
many individuals, is therefore unfounded, and is oft;en 
the mere result of not having made a trial of it Taken 
alonej and in a certain quantity, it is purgative— probably 



AKD ITS BBLA.TIONS TO HEAXTH. 9 

because it Is incompetent to excite the assimilating 
powers of the alimentary canal. 

Inferior olive-oil — ^strong-smelling^ thick, or rancid 
•—leaves an after-taste, and is less digestible. But it is 
self-evident that, with eatables at least, the very best of 
every thing is the best. 

Very light and pleasant-eating oil is extracted from 
the seeds of the white poppy. It may be used freely 
without apprehension, as the narcotic principle of the 
capsule does not extend to the seed ; and is preferable 
,to walnut-oil, which is apt to have a bitter or acrid 
twang. When oil is raised to a certain temperature (as 
likewise is the case with butter, and other modifications 
of fat), it loses its softening qualities, and is converted 
into a stimulant instead. (See sectipn Frying^ chapter 
Opekations.) 

Fat or Grease is animal oil in a solid state, obtained 
from quadrupeds or birds. It enters into the composi- 
tion of many dishes, either as one of their first con- 
stituents, or as a final addition in the way of sauce or 
seasoning. Fat is either deposited all by itself in the 
cellular tissue, — as the suet in sheep and oxen, and the 
fat in hogs, — or else it is mixed up and interposed 
amongst the muscular and fleshy parts of the meat. In 
the first case, it is difficult to digest, not stimulating 
the stomach sufficiently; in the latter, it renders the 
meat tenderer and lighter on the stomach. 

Fat, considered as a seasoning, possesses the same 
qualities as oil, and, like it, when heated to a certain 
temperature, acquires stimulant and irritating properties. 



10 CONSIDERATIONS TOUCHmO FOOD, 

But it is as a source of animal heat that oil, fat, and like- 
wise butter, derive their greatest importance as aliments. 

The warmth of our bodies is maintained by a pro- 
cess which is no other than a true combustion. We bum 
fuel to heat ourselves quite as much as a room is heated 
by burning coals in a grate. The only difference is, that 
oar temperature is better regulated. 

The two grand combustibles found in nature are 
carbon and hydrogen. But carbon and hydrogen inva- 
riably enter into the composition of eveiy animal and 
vegetable substance, — ^into wood, coal, oil, fat, spirit of 
wine — ^whatever is known as a cotnbusttblej — and into 
our food. 

Heat is the result of the union of oxygen with other 
bodies. When the oxygen taken up by the blood in the 
lungs arrives with it at the organs to which the circula- 
tion carries it — ^what does it find there ? Hydrogen and 
carbon. It imites with them, and we are warmed. 

Li a fire-place wliich gives out its genial heat, the 
oxygen of the air unites with the hydrogen and carbon of 
the wood or the coal. In the human frame the same 
oxygen combines with the carbon and hydrogen disguised 
in the forms of bread, soup, meat, cakes, preserves, and 
all the good things made of mgar^ grease^ and Jlour. 
There is hydrogen and carbon in every thing we eat 
and drink ; but those three bodies, together with toiney 
contain the most, apd are consequently the best com- 
bustibles. 

Wine, porter, beer, ale, all fermented liquors, are 
combustibles ; only, in them, the portion which bums is 



AND ITS RBLATIOKS TO HEALTH. 11 

mised with a considerable quantity of water. Bat, bj 
extracting a portion of the water, jou get brandy, which 
Ketches fire easily ; by extracting more water, you have 
spirit of wine, which bums still better. Whoever has 
fieen a tea-urn kept boiUng by a spirit-lamp can form 
«ome idea of the effects of spirit of wine in living bodies, 
«ven when much diluted with water. 

The miracle is, that the human frame should main- 
tain itself constantly at the same temperature, winter and 
summer, night and day, in the rain and in sunshine, at 
ihe equator and under the arctic circle. It is neither 
ihotter nor colder at one time than at another, whether 
supplied with an excess of combustible, or deprived of 
fiiel for days together — ^as is proved by the thermometer. 
The heat of the human body, in middle-aged persons, 
may be stated at 99'' of Fahrenheit^ In very old persons, 
it will be a degree or so lower — in children and youths, 
^ degree or so higher; and that is the whole of its 
variation. 

When we know that combustion takes place within 
us, we understand at once haw we are warmed. It is 
dear, also, that a better fire must be kept up in winter 
than in summer ; and Nature has provided for the want 
by giving us a better appetite in cold weather than in 
hot In our climate the difference is less strildng, 
because we stick to our accustomed habits, and claim the 
same daily ration, whether we require it or not To 
appreciate the relation which exists between the internal 
craving for food — that is, for combustible — and the 
external temperature, we ought to compare the diet of the 



12 CONSIDKRATIOKS TOUCHING FOOb, 

Hindoo, who lives on a handful of rice per day, with 
ihat of the Esquimaux, who, to maintain his 99** of 
warmth in a climate which freezes mercury, will occa- 
sionally swallow at a sitting his ten or fifteen quarts 
of whale-oil. It is less agreeable than cod-liver oil, 
but produces exactly the same efiectsl 

For a like reason, the Spaniard drinks water, and is 
satisfied ; whilst the wines of Bordeaux are brandied, to 
make them acceptable to the Englishman. For the 
same reason, too, the Russians swallow, without wry 
faces, bumpers of brandy that would kill an inhabitant 
of the South of France. In Sweden, the government is 
obliged to prohibit the peasantry from distilling the com 
required to supply the baker ; the Arabs have accepted, 
without raising difficulties, the precept which forbids 
tlieir using spirituous liquors. It is easy for the Arabs, 
who live in a hot country, to do without brandy ; it is 
less easy for the Swedes, who live in a cold one. The 
bearing of these facts on regimen and the state of health 
is direct and obvious. 

Tlie &t of living animals is a stock of combustible, 
stored away by the blood against a rainy day. Fat 
is the circulation's savings-bank. There it puts aside 
its little superfluities, knowing well where to find them 
in case of need. Witness the fat pig mentioned by 
Liebig, which, covered by a heap of fallen ruins, was 
found alive and well one hundred and sixty days after- 
wards. As a matter of course, he was fat no longer ; 
but even had the length of the fast been less, it is a 
notable instance of the resources which, in default of 



AND ITS BELATI0N8 TO HEALTH. 13 

food, the blood is able to find in the fat^ For the pig 
had most certainlj continued to breathe from the first 
to the last of those hundred and sixty days. His fire 
of hydrogen and carbon had never gone out for a 
minute, and a lucky thing it was for the pig that he had 
put something by in his time of plenty. The principal 
sufferer was the owner of the pig, if he reckoned on 
the luxury of rasher and ham. On this occasion piggy 
literaUy ate his own bacon. 

But aU that we eat is not burnt to keep us warm ; 
else, what would the blood have to sustain our finme 
with, and to repair the continual wear and tear of our 
organs? Our food, therefore, may be divided into tufo 
distinct kinds : one kind intended to be burnt within us, 
which may be called aliments of combustion ; the other 
destined to nourish the body, which may be called aug- 
ments of nutrition. The flour of wheat, of which bread 
is made, contains both those aliments.* 

Take a pinch of flour, and pour a little water on it, 
rubbing it gently between your fingers. The water will 
torn whiie, and cany away with it a white powder, 
which you can easily collect by letting the water settle 
in a vesseL This powder is starch — the substance to 
stiffen linen and lace, and which our forefathers wore 
as hair-powder on their periwigs. Now, starch is an 
excellent combustible, being nearly half made up of

generation, but for the instruction of their parents and teachers.

carbon. One hundred grains of starch contain, in round 
numbers, forty-five grains of carbon, six of hydrogen,, 
and forty-nine of oxygen. Starch may ahnost be styled 
the parent of a large proportion of our alimentary com-- 
bustibles ; for if, by an operation which Nature performs- 
perfectly, without assistance, in certain cases, it lose» 
a part of its carbon (leaving not more than thirty-six 
grains of carbon in every hundred grains of starch), it 
becomes — ^guess what — ^neither more nor less than tugcar^ 

And now leave Nature to cany out her work on 
this same sugar, under certain conditions, and another 
transformation will follow. About a third of its carbon 
will spontaneously combine with two-thirds of its oxygen, 
forming thereby carbonic acid, which will fly away as a* 
gas — as the bubbles which foam in your glass of cider* 
The rest is — what? Alcohol, — the other combustible 
we lately mentioned, — ^which bums even better than 
sugar and starch — seeing that a hundred grains of 
alcohol consist of fifty-three grains of carbon, thirteen 
of hydrogen, and thirty-four of oxygen. 

When all the starch is extracted from flour, there* 
remains a whitish, elastic, gluey substance (glue can 
be made of it; it is what renders common paste so 
adhesive), called gluteru Gluten dried becomes brittle- 
and semi-transparent. One hundred grains of gluten 
contain siatj/'-three grains of carbon^ seven of hydrogeUf 
thirteen, of oxygen^ and seventeen of azote. Please note 
the respective number of grains, and also the novel 
element (azote) introduced. 

Here you are requested to give a moment's attention 



AND ITS BELATI0K3 TO HEALTH. 15 

to a well-known fact When a man is bled, the blood 
drawn firom him soon separates of itself into two parts 
— a yellowish transparent liquid, and a dark red mass 
floating in it. The clotted floating mass owes its colour 
to an inflnite number of little red bodies (called the 
corpttsetUeSy and which can be seen with the microscope), 
which are held, as it were, in a net, by the meshes of a 
peculiar substance, which — ^pray remark this carefully 
— 18 whiiishy elastic^ gluey. Dried^ it becomes brittle cmd 
8emi'4ran9parent. One hundred graina of ihie substance 
contain sixty^three grains cf carbon^ seven of hydrogen, 
thirteen of oxygen^ and seventeen of azote. It is called 
fUnine, and is destined to form the fibres of the muscles 
which are contained, already half-made, in the blood. 

If, as we have just seen, the constituent elements 
of fibrine and glaten are the same, the reason is, 
that, in reality, the two substances are only one. The^ 
most learned man would be very hard pressed if they 
were shown to him, dry, side by side, to decide which 
sample was obtained from flour, and which from blood. 
Not only, therefore, are our musdes contained, already 
half-formed, in our blood, but, better still, their fibres^ 
exist, ready to be made use of, in the bread we eat 

We have here, then, a primary aliment of nutrition. 
There is no need to be over-anxious about the bodily 
health of the man who has plenty of good bread to eat 
He has sufficient starch to keep himself warm, and suffix 
dent gluten to sustain his strength. It is only his- 
palate that will be inclined to grumble. 

Another curious coincidence. When milk is curdled,. 



16 CONSIDERATIONS TOUCHING FOOD, 

there takes place in it exactly the same separation as 
in blood. Li a yellowish transparent liquid, the whey, 
floats the white coagulated curd which is made into 
cheese, and a considerable portion of which would have 
made butter, had the milk been churned instead of 
curdled. By carefully removing the butter from the 
curd, a sort of white powder is obtained, which is the 
essential principle of cheese, and which is called caseinej 
from the Latin ea^eus^ ^^ cheese." And Us constituents 
are the same as those offbrine and gluten ! One hundred 
parts of caseine are made up of sixty-three parts of carbon^ 
seven of hydrogen^ thirteen of oxygen^ and seventeen of azote. 

It now needs no conjurer to explain why bread and 
cheese furnish a substantial meal. The persons on whom 
falls the task of detecting and preventing adulteration, 
will perceive the importance of their duties, when they 
find that skimmed milk is deficient in heat-giving, 
watered milk in nutritive, quality. Buttermilk and 
whey, however light and refreshing, are very poor be- 
verages indeed. 

But caseine is not found in milk alone. It exists 
in great abundance in peas, beans, lentils, and haricots, 
which are full of cheese, however strange you may 
think it. Little cheeses are sold in the streets of Canton, 
which it is impossible to distinguish from our own, as 
far as their material is concerned : only, in making them, 
the Chinese do not use a drop of milk. They reduce 
peas to a clear broth; then they curdle the brotli, as 
we do milk, and by the same means: they press the 
curd, salt it, put it into moulds, exactly as we should, 



AKB ITS RELATIONS TO HEALTH. 17 

and so produce a cheese — a real cheese, composed of 
veritable caseiiie. Give it to a chemist, and ask what 
a hundred grains of it contain ; and he will hand to you 
the formula which has been already thrice repeated. 

We have discovered two grand aliments of nutrition 
— gluten and caseine: a third remains to be inquired 
after. 

We know that a chicken — skin, muscles, eyes, and 
every thing — is entirely formed from the contents of tb& 
egg, during the marvellous process of hatching. It is 
clear that the elements of all its organs must hav9 
been contained beforehand in the liquids of the egg. 
Nobody introduced them while the hen was sitting; 
and if Nature, with those liquids, can make the skin 
and muscles of a fowl, it is probable she will have 
no more difficulty, if we swallow the contents of an 
egg, in converting them into skin and muscle /or us. 

An egg, therefore, contains an incontestably nutri- 
tious aliment called dihumvney from the Latin albumen — 
white of egg. It is recognised by one particularly 
striking quality. Exposed to a temperature varying 
from 140** to 167** Falu*. (according to the quantity 
of water mixed with it), albumine hardens, and, from 
a colourless, transparent liquid, becomes the white, 
opaque, elastic substance known to every one who has 
eaten hard-boiled eggs. This is a property which should 
never be forgotten by cooks — for it gives them the power 
of retaining, in the article they are dressing (by plung- 
ing it in boiling liquid), all the nutritive albumine 
held by its tissues. From articles put to cook in cold 





18 CONSIDERATIONS TOUCHING FOOD, 

water, part of the albamine oozes out during ihe process. 
If soup is to be made with the boilings — ^well and 
good ; if not, it is a needless diminution of the nutritive 
quality of the article cooked. One hundred parts of 
aJbumine contain sixty-three parts of carbon ; there is no 
need to repeat the rest — ^the reader already knows the 
combination by heart 

A step fiirther in advance: The yellowish liquid 
in which floats the clot of coagulated blood is called the 
serumy which is Latin for whey. If you set this serum 
on the fire, in little longer time tlian it takes to boil an 
egg hard, it becomes full of a white opaque substance, 
which is no other than the albumine we have just been 
mentioning. Our blood, therefore, contains white of 
egg — and that in even greater quantity than fibrine. 

But fibrine, caseine, albumine— as our famous formula 
reveals to us — are at bottom one and the same thing, 
the same body under different aspects. Eggs are not 
the only things which furnish albumine. Exactly as we 
have found in vegetables the fibrine of muscle and the 
caseine of milk, we shall also, without having far to 
look, find in them the albumine of the egg. It exists in 
grass, in salad, in all the tencfer parts of plants. The 
juice of vegetables, especially, contains notable quantities 
of albumine. 

A word about the new element, azote, or nitrogen, 
which enters into these last three identical formulas, or 
receipts to make gluten, caseine, and albumine: although 
it is not V3e who can make them. It is easier to pick 
things to pieces than to put them properly together again. 



AND ITS BELATIOKS TO HEALTH. 19 

AinoD£:st the substances most familiar to us are Air 
and Water. Water, I beg to remind the reader, is a 
<Jiemicctl eombination of oxygen and hydrogen. The two 
gases are united, incorporated into each other's substance, 
in a manner of which we can form no conception* Air 
is a mere niixtyre of oxygen and azote ; there is no more 
combination than between coffee and chicory, or brick- 
dost and snuff, in the drawers of fraudulent shopkeepers. 
What azote does in the air, would be hard to say. It 
seems a mere sleeping partner in the concern, oxygen 
transacting all the active business. In respiration, for 
instance, azote enters our lungs side by side with his 
inseparable companion ; but as he came in, so he goes 
out again, without leaving a trace of his presence. 
Nevertheless — as also happens in human society — this 
insignificant individual takes up the most room. He 
occupies four-fifths of the atmosphere, where he seems 
to render little other service than to curb the fiery 
temper of oxygen, who would set fire to every thing, 
if he had it all his own way. Azote has been compared 
to the water in grog, which would bum holes in our 
stomachs if we took the spirit pure. 

Nevertheless, we must not suppose that this pacific 
diluter of oxygen is strengthless. Like cold people, who 
become terrible when once excited, azote is capable of 
violent action when really imited to another body. 
Azote, combined (not mixed) with oxygen, forms aqua 
fortu — " strong water" — nitric acid, which bites copper, 
and devours whatever it touches. Combined with hydro- 
gen, azote becomes ammonia, volatile alkali, popularly 



20 CONSIDERATIONS TOUCHING FOOD, 

known as smelling-salts, hartshorn — ono of the most 
energetic substances existing. Azote with carbon makes 
a strange combination — a child who behaves as if he had 
neither father nor mother — ^which, again combined with 
hydrogen, is nothing less than prussic acid, a drop of 
which on your tongue would strike you dead. 

Azote, therefore, is not altogether so mild as, at first 
sight, you take it to be. There is no trusting to it, or 
knowing what it may do. Nevertheless, it has been 
already shown that all its combinations are not equally 
dangerous. Tlio very same elements which, two by 
two, or three together, destroy every thing, — those same 
elements form, in a combination of four, the invaluable 
aliment of nutrition of which our bodies are composed. 
Indeed, its real name is azotised aliment^ nitrogenous food; 
because it is the presence of azote or nitrogen which 
especially determines its formation : so much so, that it 
has been customary to estimate tlie nutritive value of 
food according to the quantity of azote it contains. 

Azote, in fact, appears to be a substance appropriated 
to the special use of every creature endowed with life. 
Its three companions in our formula (carbon, hydrogen, 
and oxygen) wander, in troops and torrents, through the 
whole extent of terrestrial creation ; but azote, with the 
exception of its atmospheric domain (where it reigns 
in a state of majestic repose), is rarely met with, except 
in the bodies of animals, or in the parts of plants destined 
to be fed on by animals. 

Moreover, azote has to be wire-drawn through many 
an aperture and chink before reaching the post of honour 



AND ITS BKLATIONS TO HKALTH. 21 

assigned to it in the Animal Kingdom. The animal 
itself can do nothing with it, unless it has first been 
absorbed and prepared by the vegetable ; and the vege- 
table can derive no benefit from it so long as it remains 
isolated in its atmospheric retreat It is only when 
entrapped into one of the above-named liaisons (the 
second especially, which produces ammonia) that it con- 
sents to join the Dance of Life, instead of rioting in the 
Dance of Death. Then, in the mysterious depths of 
vegetation, is organised the marvellous Quadrille of 
Nutritious Aliments, whose proportions should be bla- 
zoned in letters of gold : Carbon, sixty-three ; Hydrogen, 
seven; Oxygen, thirteen; Azote, seventeen — all odd, 
and three indivisible numbers — make one hundred of 
what may be truly called the solid staff and elixir of life. 
Well, therefore, does Jean Mac6 conclude that the 
Vegetable Kingdom is nothing else than the vast kitchen 
in which are cooked the dinners of the Animal Kingdom. 
When we cat the ox, it is the grass which lie has eaten 
ihat actually nourishes us. For us, he is a mere inter- 
mediary or go-between, who transfers to us intact tlie 
albumine extracted by his stomach from the herbage 
supplied by his pasture-grounds. He is the waiter of 
Nature's eating-house ; the dishes he brings have been 
put into bis hand already prepared. Only, to appreciate 
his services properly, we must remember that very small 
indeed are the nutritious portions fiimished by grass, 
and that it would be a weary task for our digestion to 
have to elaborate them one by one. We might bo 
starved to death with a full stomach, as happened to 



22 CONSIDERATIONS TOUCHING FOOD, 

some unfortunate Australian explorers, who found plenty 
of nardoo to eat, but nothing else. The ox presents 
us with those little portions concentrated }n a plateful of 
niUriiive aliment; and our stomachs, and consequently 
our health, are the gainers by his complaisance. 

The distinction, which has been thus fully explained, 
between aliments of combustion and aliments ofnutritUmj 
should never be forgotten by the home-physician, the 
nurse, the doctor, and the housekeeper. It should 
guide every individual's bill of fare. For what can b© 
clearer than that growing children and' adolescents have 
greater need of additional material to build up their 
frame, than the adult or the aged, to whom the same 
supply of growth-making material is not only super- 
fluous, but positively adverse ? that amongst adults, the 
hard-working labourer, the sportsman, the traveller, 
have greater need of repairs than the gentleman who 
leisurely sits at home at ease? that even sedentary 
persons make different expenditures of exertion, wliid) 
require to be replaced accordingly ? Tlie statesman who 
conducts a policy, the author who writes a book, the 
business-man who manages a concern, draw more freely 
on their strength and nervous energy than the lounger 
who skims the daily papers, the reader who whiles away 
an hour with a novel, or the customer who purchases 
an article at a shop. 

The distinction is likewise of great importance both 
to persons who are Too Fat, and to those who are Too 
Lean* The former have had their afSictions attended to 
by medical writei*s, both in England and France. The 



AND ITS BEIATIONS TO HEALTH. 23 

latter, if enjoying tolerable health in Bpite of their lean- 
ness, will be wise to let well alone, consoling themselves 
with the sporting proverb, " A lean dog for a long 
heat.*' If they feel unwell and weak, let them consult 
some respectable, properly educated physician, and beware 
of the arts of unscrupulous advertising practitioners. 

For some time past it has been a well-known &ct 
that dry bread and pure spring water constitute a 
diet whose fattening effects had either been ignored or 
remsuned unknown. To grow fat, you are advised to 
drink largely of water and fermented beverages, and 
to eat abundance of farinaceous and starchy food. To 
grow thin, drink very little, confining that little to 
unwatered wine, coffee, and tea, and abstain from all 
aliments containing starch. 

The action of water and of starchy matters on the 
human economy is very striking. Almost all the na- 
tives of Central America have the abdomen extremely 
developed, and are generally fat Their drink is water, 
and they eat little besides bananas, sweet batatas, and 
fish. In our own climate, we can hardly avoid observ- 
ing that persons who eat a large quantity of bread, and 
take but little bodily exercise, are generally plethoric 
Their skin is soft and dull ; their flesh is puffy instead 
of being muscular. In short, it is a great mistake to 
confound aliments which fatten with those which afford 
nutriment and sustain strength. 

The food taken into the system, and which is stored 
there in the shape of fat, is uselessly swallowed, so far 
as the generation oimuactdar strength is concerned. If 



24 CONSn>ERATIOHS TOUCHING FOOD, 

two men In good health eat equal quantities of tlie 
same alimentary substances, and one of them grows fat, 
while the other does not, the fatter will soon become the 
weaker personage. He will weigh more, but will be 
capable of doing less work. The bodily strength of 
an individual decreases in proportion as he makes fat, 
which — it is needless to repeat the fact — ^is so much 
strength laid on one side in the shape of unemployed 
capital. 

A diet of bread and water, and notliing else, would 
become, in the long run, extremely weakening. Added 
to a strengthening regimen, it would most assuredly 
bring on stoutness; alone, its continued action must 
prove injurious to health. The muscular effoi*ts which 
the above-mentioned American Indians are capable of 
making are far inferior to those of well-fed Europeans, 
who will easily do three timed as much work as the former. 

If, therefore, a watery and farinaceous diet excite 
the development of certain organs, it must not be for- 
gotten that it supplies insufficient nutriment, and that 
it generates but little muscular strength. You lose in 
power what you gain in volume ; the balance remains 
the same. One of its effects, however, must be noticed, 
as it is of great importance to mothers and nurses — 
namely, that its action is very remarkable in increasing 
the production of Milk. Nay, so susceptible is this 
secretion of variation from outward causes, that tlie 
diiferences of humidiiy in the atmosphere of climates 
will make a difference in the quantity of milk produced 
both by domestic animals and their mistresses. 



AUD ITS BELATIONS TO HEALTH. 25 

Let, therefore, every nursing mother, especially if 
thin, gratify at will her desire for drink, eating plenty 
of moist and &rinaceous food — tea and bread-and-butter, 
good broths with toasted bread or rice in them — ^sus- 
tained by meat, good beer, or porter, or wine, to keep 
up the necessary strength. Stout nurses have less need 
to indulge their fits of thirstiness, because their organism 
is suffused with lymph, whidi holds a large quantity 
of water in reserve. For them, the veiy act of nursing 
— supported by a generous diet — ^is healthy and medi- 
cinal, restraining, by the most natural means, constitu- 
tional tendencies to embonpoint or dropsy. 

Excessive thinness may proceed from severe mental 
or bodily labour ; from disease, or a morbid state either 
of certain organs or the entire constitution; and, thirdly, 
firom improper or insufficient food, i.e. from starvation 
in one of its forms. For the first, the obvious remedy 
is rest ; easy to prescribe, but sometimes liard to admi- 
nister. For tlie second, recourse must be had to sound 
and safe medical advice; for, unfortunately, there are 
quacks in the world who prey upon the weakness of their 
patients, making them believe they are victims of disease 
which has in reality no existence, and threatening them 
with terrible consequences to result from causes inade- 
quate to produce such effects. Their tactics are, to draw 
attention to themselves by vague, mysterious, and repul- 
sive pamphlets ; to extort from really imaginary invalids 
the confession of some transitory or occasional error ; to 
excite their terrors respecting what may ensue, and to 
urge the belief that from tJieir hands only is an antidote 



26 CONSIDERATIONS TOUCHING FOOD, 

to be found Phantom maladies are to be averted on the 
payment of fees which are any thing but phantoms. 
By exaggerating or misrepresenting symptoms (and 
often by false statements, either ignorantly or fraudu- 
lently made), they lead people to fancy that a slight 
indisposition or loss of flesh is the inevitable precursor of 
mortal illness — ^unless tliey are consulted, at No. 000, 
between the hours of ten and three. They alone are 
capable of curing otherwise incurable disease. All 
ordinary and established remedies are worthless. And 
so they pursue a system of terrorism, firightening people 
out of their lives, and driving them into their con- 
sulting-rooms by sheer intimidation. The patient who 
once has crossed their threshold may be likened to a fly 
in a spider's net 

Therefore, let people who are discontented and thin, 
eschewing advertising pamphleteers, and consulting their 
family doctor and their cook, try tlie benefit to be 
derived from cheerful companionship, fresh air, and 
kitchen physic. Or, by way of pastime, if so minded, 
they may essay an old specific recorded by Aldrovandi ; 
from whom we learn that the Egyptian dames (the lead- 
ing beauties of Pharaoh's court) employed chicken-broth 
as a bath to fatten their pretty selves. Of how many 
chickens the broth was made, and how spiced and 
seasoned, he does not tell ; but the etiquette was, that 
the lady to be fattened, while sitting in her broth-bath, 
should eat one whole chicken out of those whose broth 
supplied her bath. 

Leanness from insufficient food must bo considered 



AND ITS BEIATIOKS TO HEALTH. 27 

with greater seriousness and sympathy. Few people 
imagine that it is bronght about by something more than 
mere inanition and exhaustion. It is not the empty 
stomach only which causes starving people to grow diin. 

We hare seen that when an animal takes in more 
aliment of combustion than it requires for present use, the 
blood deposits it in a Savings-Banky which is called by 
butchers and cooks the Fat. The blood acts like a pro- 
yident person, — and its action is guided by Creative 
Providence, — in thus storing superfluous combustible, 
instead of letting it run to waste. 

We have seen that we are warmed by an internal 
fire, kept up by fuel carried to it by the blood ; that fiiel 
is derived from the food which we take in at our daily 
meals. If there is enough fiiel, and a little to spare, it 
is well ; if there is not enough, so much the worse for 
the unfortunates who have not enough. Those who can 
eat and drink whatever they like, whenever they are 
hungry and dry — their three, four, five meals a day — 
have enough; perhaps, to spare. Those with scanty 
rations — one or two niggardly snacks a day, beginm'ng 
fiunished, and leaving off hungry because there is no 
more ; and the weather may be cold, the clothing light, 
the dweUing leaky to wind and rain — ^have not enough* 
What happens ? 

The blood is inexorable. It has its duty to fulfil — to 
feed the fire; and it vrUl feed it, let what may happen. 
The temperature of the body miMt be maintained. If 
there is no fat or fuel in reserve ; if the stomach takes 
in no fiiel, or not enough, — ^the Blood relentlessly lays

hands on every tiling witliin its reach to keep the flame 
of life from going out A cold body is a dead body ; 
and its task is to prevent that : which Jean Mac^ illus- 
trates by a historical anecdote. 

In the roign of Francis L of France, there lived 
in the Perigord an honest peasant, whose name was 
Bernard Palissy. In those days, crockery plates were 
not to he liad by every body that wanted them. Tlie 
Italians, who alone possessed the secret of making them, 
kept it to themselves ; and Bernard, who knew a little 
about tlie matter through his experience as a working 
glass-blower, set to work to discover it all by.himsel£ 
He turned potter, without asking any body's advice, 
building furnaces, collecting fuel as he could, making 
his first pots more or less clumsily, lighting his fires, 
baking his wares, and awaiting success. It was fifteen 
or sixteen years before it came. He made fifteen or 
sixteen ruinous experiments, which would have dis- 
couraged a man of wealth. But he, as soon as he had 
scraped together a little money witli his glass, returned 
to his task with indomitable perseverance, insensible to 
poverty, deaf to his neighbom's' taunts, and immovable 
by his wife's maledictions, who was furious at having to 
go partners in liis heroism witJiout the slightest inclina- 
tion to do so. 

One day, the rumour ran through the village — la 
Chapelle Biron— « Bernard is gone crazy. He is 
burning his house to bake his pots !" And it was true, 
as far as tlie pots and the house wore concerned. While 
a batcli was bakiug, wood ran short. Bernard began by 



AND ITS RELATIONS TO HEALTH. 29 

taking the palisades of his garden ; then the tables and 
dressers; and then the floor. What his wife said may 
be supposed. Bat he paid no attention to her polite 
remarks. With his eyes fixed on the implacable 
famace, he fed it — ^and fed it — ^thinking of nothing but 
his pottery in jeopardy. The joists of Uie roof would 
have followed the floor, if his pots had not' been baked 
enough. 

The Blood does the same, when combustibles run 
short It pulls the house to pieces, and throws it into 
the fire, bit by bit. The &t naturally goes first, as 
has already been explained. It is the wood-stack 
provided as a matter of course, and may totally dis- 
appear without injury to the building. Then comes 
the turn of the muscles — ^moro useful, but not exactly 
indispensable. They are Bernard's garden palisades : in 
case of absolute necessity, we can exist without them. 
They are melted down, so to speak, after a few days^ 
fasting, and the patient is a bundle of skin and bone. 
If the same state of privation continues, and the flesh, 
exhausted, suffices no longer, the Blood does not 
hesitate. It boldly attacks the most essential organs, 
without considering the consequences : and if succour 
from without does not come in time, the house is no 
longer habitable. Life is turned out of doors; the man 
dies of hunger. 

But exactly as poor Bernard Palissy worked in 
reality for the benefit of his wife and children (whose 
welfare he was struggling to secure, although at the 
risk of their not having a house to hide their heads in), 



30 CONSIDERATIONS TOUCHING FOOD, 

SO does ihe Blood strive, to the last moment, to save the 
Life which it finally evicts; and the work of destruc- 
tion, which ends by turning it out, has actually pro- 
longed Lifers stay in tlie mansion. Without it, all 
would have been sooner over. 

My readers will imagine — I hope with reason — that 
no such demolition of their bodily frame is ever likely 
to happen to tJiem; and yet, the wealthiest are exposed 
to accident by shipwreck, siege, and adventurous travel. 
But at least they will understand tlie sufferings of 
starving creatures who, in consequence of insufficient 
food, are preyed upon and brought to tlie grave by the 
action of the vital fluid which, in prosperous circum- 
stances, would supply them with continued strength 
and spirits. It is a lesson of Thankfulness — and of 
Charity. 

To return to our Condiments. Salty Chloride of 
Sodium, serves as the basis of all seasonings into which 
sugar does not enter. Some cooks even put a little 
salt into sweet things, as plum-pudding. It excites 
digestion, by promoting an abundant secretion of tlie 
stomach^s fluids; and the secretion is so considerable, 
when a large quantity of salt has been eaten, that severe 
thirst is excited before the digestion is complete. 
Without salt, a large quantity of mucilaginous aliments 
would be with difficulty assimilated; indeed, in tlio 
present state of civilisation, there are few articles of 
food that can be digested without salt. This condiment 
has no apparent general effect unless used immoderately. 
In that case, it is accused of causing scurvy, — which is 



AUD ITS RELATIONS TO HEALTH. 31 

not trne ; scarvy being for the most part brought on bj 
the want of a due proportion of fresh vegetable matters 
in the dietary. Nevertheless, many people cannot eat 
ham or very salt eheese at three meals running without 
having pain or soreness in their gums. 

Vineffar is best obtained by the acetic fermentation 
of wine. When employed in moderate doses, its action 
is merely local, like that of salt It similarly excites 
the salivary glands, the mucous reservoirs in the mem- 
brane of the mouth. Too freely taken, it is apt to 
excite in the stomach an irritation which, acting sympa- 
thetically on the respiratory passages, occasions cough. 
Its pretended property of reducing stoutness is mani- 
:fested only at the expense of health, and by deep 
injuries to one or more of the organs essential to life. 
It is a seasoning scarcely suited to nervous persons, and 
is even productive of harm in cases where the breathing 
apparatus is irritable. 

Garlic is .one of the things which may hardly be 
mentioned te British ears polite. Nevertheless, in the 
South of Europe and elsewhere, it is very largely 
employed as a condiment, as well as very generally 
confided in as an alterative, stimulant, tonic, and 
sudorific domestic medicine. This, it must be allowed, 
is a tolerably fair allowance of useful qualities, at 
least sufficient to make it worth an invalid's considera- 
tion. Two things are adverse to its use — the prejudice 
against its very name, and its peculiar smell.' The first 
will be shaken off by people of sense ; tlie second is 
immaterial when weakly persons are being nursed in 



32 COKSIDEBATIONS TOUCHIKO FOOD^ 

retirement, and restoration to health is the paramount 
object 

With regard to garlic taken in society : There exists 
a story (it is not new) of a slap on the face having been 
given at a convivial meeting; when, to avoid serious 
consequences, some one had the presence of mind to 
think of passing it on all round ; so that, eveiy body 
having received a slap— in joke— nobody could reason- 
ably take offence. 

The same is the case with garlic. If administered 
to one of a company^ — even if that company consists of 
no more than two — it must be administered to all. As 
the bride said, when asked if she would take seasoning 
with her duck, " Well, dear Johnny, I hardly know. If 
you do, I do ; if you don't, I don't" But garlic is sucli 
a matter of use, that persons accustomed to it eat it raw 
wiUi the same satisfaction as they would munch a radish. 

Garlic has a stimulating effect on the stomach, owing 
to a very volatile acrid principle, which is soluble in

aids the digestion of mucilaginous and gelatinous dishes' 
— calf s head, sheeps' trotters, cow-heel, and the like. 
Its general effects are a certain excitement of the ex- 
halant organs, caused by the sharp stimulus given to 
the stomach, perhaps also by the passage into the blood 
of its volatile principle, which perfumes with its odour 
not only the mouth, but the perspiration, &c.

of neutralism ff noxious emanations, but right if referred 
to its stimulating effects on the internal organs, thereby 
determining a movement of the fluids from within to 
without. The absorbent pores are stopped by their own 
transpirant action. The surface of the body is varnished 
over, as it were, with a thin coating of moisture or 
even of mere vapour, which prevents the elements of 
infection from entering the system. With this prophy- 
lactic object in view, it is not an unwise precaution to 
eat of some dish well seasoned with garlic before visiting 
spots afflicted with cholera, small*pox, measles, typhoid 
fever, or other reputed infectious disease. 

Amongst the wealthy, garlic suits the sluggish 
stomachs of lymphatic subjects as well as those weak- 
ened by a tropical climate. It is beneficial to sojourners 
in severely cold countries, and to individuals who, with 
a diet of inferior bread and poor pasty soup, have 
yet to exert great muscular force to maintain them- 
selves and their families. 

Garlic, moreover, is useful, by replacing calomel 
and other dangerous medicines, as a vermifuge. The 
dose is an ordinary clove of garlic (a clove is one of 
the portions into which a root or bulb of garlic naturally 
divides itself) taken at breakfast or dinner. It may be 
eaten with bread and salt, like cress or any other 
imcooked vegetable; or it may be chopped very fine, 
and sprinkled over salad containing hard eggs, cold 
fish, crab, &c. &c. It may be administered to young 
children, boiled in milk. Invalids who cannot overcome 
their repugnance may swallow it in pills*

Pepper is a pungent aromatic seed brought from 
the equatorial regions. It acts on the stomach as a 
powerAil stimulant, causing a sensation of warmth or 
heat. In small quantities, it is advantageously associ- 
ated with white and gelatinous meats, as veal and rabbit; 
with the tendonous parts of animals, as feet and heads ; 
with oily fish, as herrings and eels; with shell-fish, 
which contain no excitant principles; and with muci- 
laginous, insipid vegetables, as cardoons, cauliflowers, 
Jerusalem artichokes, cucumbers, asparagus, and the 
like. It assists the digestion of all those aliments which, 
by themselves, make but a feeble appeal to the powers 
of the stomach. Taken in excess, it brings on inflam- 
mation of the stomach, and even of the intestinal 
canal. And in persons who have already suffered from 
gastritis, it is more apt, even in moderate doses, to 
cause the complaint to return than wine or any other 
stimulant. 

Pepper not merely exerts a local action on the 
animal economy, but, whether by sympathy or by intro- 
duction into the circulation, it produces stimulant effects 
ou all the organs. A good deal of what is said about 
pepper is applicable to Ginger^ Allspice j Cloves^ Ntxtmegy

Respecting tlie wholesomeneBS and ezpedieney of 
spioes^ as doctors differ, the present Doctor will only 
give a snnunaiy of their opinions. The role to follow 
most be fonnded on each individual's personal experi- 
ence. Many people like and are the better for an 
occasionally high-spiced dish, partaken of at soffidentty 
distant intervals, whose stomachs woold be pnt oat of 
order by eating the same qnantily of seasoning every 
day. This is equally applicable to horse-radish, mus- 
tard, aromatic herbs, and the sauces strongly tinctured 
with them, as to the spices proper. 

The cool-systom school toll us that pepper, after 
augmenting the activity of the heart, causes itching of 
die skin, and often eruptions ; that it is unsuited to the 
inhabitants of temperate climates — that it diortens their 
lives ; and is good for nothing except to bring on irrita- 
tion of every kind ; that with us, persons of lymphatic 
temperament, and old people whose constitutions are not 
irritable and whose stomachs are in a perfectly healthy 
«tate, may alone indulge in the use of pepper. It dis- 
agrees with bilious and sanguine temperaments, as well 
as with young people in general. It is a veriteble 
poison for irritable constitutions, when recovering £rom 
any form of irritation whatsoever. 

Nevertheless, it is admitted in practice that use may 
render condiments almost as indispensable as aliments. 
It reduces the latter to the impossibility of yielding 
nutriment without the assistance of the former. 



36 COKSII>ERATIONS TOUCHINa FOOD, 

When it is desired to diminish without inconvenience 
the quantity of seasoning taken bj an individual whose 
robust temperament and slight bodil j exercise render it 
unnecessaiyy but who complains that he can digest 
nothing without its aid, we must begin bj putting him 
on smaller rations of foody taking care that thej be of a 
nature to tax the energies of his stomach as little as 
possible. After which, by gradually augmenting both 
the allowance and the solidity of his aliment, the organ 
whose excitabiliiy had been exliausted will soon recover 
its healthy tone and duly fulfil its digestive office. 

But if, during this apatlietic state of the stomach, 
heavy and unavoidable muscular toil has to be per- 
formed, and if it becomes necessary to take liberal 
nourishment in order to support it, then tlie use of 
stimulant condiments cannot be abandoned ; for without 
them the stomach, exhausted like the rest of the system, 
could not digest The only way to ameliorate this un- 
satisfisictoiy state of things, is to reduce the muscular 
toil within moderate and reasonable limits. The remark 
applies equally to every act or effort which has a tendency 
to exhaust the system. 

If the apathetic state of the stomach arises from a 
general apathy of the constitution, as is the case with 
subjects of extremely lymphatic temperament, that state 
must be remedied by acting upon the whole system at 
once. For the use of stimulating condiments, without 
any other change in the regimen, would only irritate 
the mucous membrane of the stomach, without com- 
municating to that organ a greater degree of constitu-

iional energy. With stimnlants to the stomach there 
must coincide stimulants to the lungs and the skin — 
such as a warm and dry atmosphere, greater exposure 
to the solar rays, flannel clothing, frictions^ baths, 
Ac. 

It is rare that a much enfeebled digestion is not the 
result of chronic gastritis. Mistakes on this point are 
so grave — nay, so dangerous — that the physician's advice 
should be had recourse to. 

The following symptoms are important to note. 
Condiments assitt digestion, if the habitual languor of 
the stomach is simply owing to its weakness. On the 
other hand, they increase the uneasiness felt after eating, 
if that uneasiness arises fix)m gastric irritation. So that 
a few glasses of good wine, or a little spice, are the 
touchstone which decide whether a weak digestion is 
owing to Hie inactivity of the stomach, or to its irritation^ 
supposing tliat other symptoms leave the question in 
obscurity. 

Nevertheless, it must be admitted that cfrtain per- 
sons, although evidently suffering from a damaged 
stomach, digest better when stimulating substances are 
added to their food. And yet the continued use of 
those substances, by increasing the stomach's irritation, 
tends to bring about its final destruction. 

The warm-system school recommends, on the con- 
trary, tliat dishes which constitute our daily diet should 
be well seasoned by the cook, on the ground that con- 
diments, like liqueurs or generous wines at dessert, are 
eminenily vermifuge. Insipid, sweet, and mucnaginous

dishes, green fruits and unripe vegetables, encourage the 
development of intestinal parasites, and thereby become 
the source of obstinate and increasing indisposition. 
Well-seasoned food, thej hold, agrees with all constita- 
tions at every period of life, and was only prohibited 
by medical prejudices entertained by a diqne of p»c- 
titioners at the commencement of the present century. 
They frightened their patients into abstinence from spice 
and vinous beverages. People have now got over their 
fright, and find their digestion the better for it 

To all which may be said, ^^ A middle course is wisest. 
Common sense teaches that, as excess is hurtful, so 
complete abstinence may be likewise an error. It is 
possible to us^, without abusing. The exact measure 
must depend on individual experience.'^ 

But the question of condiments is important, because 
all animals are nourished, not so much by the quantity 
of nutriment contained in their food, as by their power 
of digesting it. Whatever, therefore, assists digestion, 
at the same time increases nutrition. For, to maintain 
health and favour growth, the two conditions must be 
present — ^the food must contain sufficient aliment, and 
the stomach must have the power of appropriating that 
aliment. Food, however nourishing, which is not di- 
gested, renders no service to health and strength ; the 
eater might as well have eaten substances absolutely 
innutritious. Hay perfectly su£Sces for the sustenance 
of herbivorous and ruminant animals ; but, whatever 
nutriment it contains, carnivorous animals cannot live 
on it, simply because their stomachs are incapable of 



AND rrS BKLATIONS TO HEALTH. 39 

extracting its nutriment, and not at all beoaose it is 
ionolritions. 

Professor Tyndall, with his marvellous clearness of 
view, puts the case both strongly and strikinglj. ^^ Those 
who reflect on vital processes— on the changes which 
occur in the animal body, and the relation of the forces 
involved in food to muscular force — ^are led naturally to 
entertain the idea of interdependence between those 
forces." " For every stroke of work done by the steam<> 
engine, for every pound that it lifts, and eveiy wheel it 
sets in motion, an equivalent quantity of heat disappears. 
A ton of coal furnishes by its combustion a certain definite 
amount of heat" 

The strength of a steam-engine is derived from the 
combustion of the carbon in the, coal supplied to it, as 
the strength of a horse is derived from the combustion 
of the carbon in the hay supplied to it Their power of 
working, quite independent of vitality, is derived from 
a like cause — ^the combustion of carbon ; only the steam- 
en^ne can bum coal, the horse cannot, because he cannot 
digest it. But suppose for a moment that, by the addition 
of some sauce, some subtle ingredient, coal were rendered 
digestible by a horse's stomach, it would then supply him 
also with the requisite quantity of heat and muscular force. 

Now, the Cook's art, assisted by the spice-box, are 
to the sick and the convalescent what the imaginary 
ingredient mixed with coal would be to the horse. They 
render indigestible things digestible ; they extract nourish- 
ment from what would otherwise refuse to afford it; they 
cause life to linger and establish its quarters in the fragile

tenement it was on the point of quitting. The soup- 
kettle and the stew-pan thus take rank as veritable 
chemical apparatus ; the cruet-stand unexpectedly rises 
to the dignity of a medicine-chest. 

It is dear, then, that in providing for the sick and 
convalescent, we must consider not so much the absolute 
quality of their food — ^not what we^ in robust health, can 
enjoy and grow fleshy on — but what they can take and 
bear ; what they like, what they fancy, what they long 
for. Their invalid's instinct often leads them right, 
though opposed to what we should choose for them. 
Nor should attendant friends refuse to gratify the wish, 
unless it bears marks of absolute insanity. The first 
thing which one delicate patient, flickering between life 
and death, would take after the crisis of a typhoid fever 
was three or four cockles I Another patient, very hard 
hit by the small-pox, a few hours after it turned would 
have a pint of porter, had it, and recovered rapidly. 
Persons familiar with sick chambers will easily multiply 
like instances. What wo call the whimsies of tlie sick 
are quite as frequently the suggestions of nature. To 
refuse to gratify them is not only harsh, but in most 
cases injudicious and injm'ious. 

The order in which articles of food are eaten is also 
not without its importance. The keeping back of the 
most stimulant dish until the close of a meal is an 
assistance rendered to digestion, which is usually retarded 
by the reception of sweet or insipid substances. Such 
may be partaken of with greater advantage when the 
stomach still is empty.

BOIUNa, ROASTING, ETC., AND THEIR EFFECTS. 

Cookery is iihe art of rendering food more digestible, or 
more palatable, by exposing it for a time to the action 
of moderate heat Heat is the grand agent which causes 
change in the internal constitution, the outward appear- 
ance, the very nature, of all bodies. Instances familiar 
to the most careless eye are water tmder its three most 
dissimilar forms of solid ice, a liquid, and steam or vapour ; 
and butter under a July sun, and butter from the dairy 
on a January morning. Without being philosophers, it 
was natural that men, from the earliest epochs, should 
employ this universal agent, heat, to modify the sub- 
stance capable of serving them as alimeq^. But with 
forther knowledge, both of the means of employing heat 
in its various degrees, and of the nature of the viands 
on which it is made to act, a cook will set about her 
work in a more rational manner, and with a greater 
certainty of satisfiustory results. 

The ways in wluch heat is employed in cookery are 
few. First, we have roasting — probably the oldest 
mode of cooking. Boasting before a fire is cooking by 
radiated heat — ^the heat-rays, darted out from the fire, 
are caught by the joint hanging before it. In tliis case, 
although a good cook will screen her meat from draughts, 
to allow the heat to penetrate the joint as equally as

may be^ the poasSnlity of the process is quite Independent 
of the warmth of the surrounding air. Professor Tjndall 
tells us that — ^^ A joint of meat might be roasted before 
a fire, the air around the joint being cold as ice." Tlie 
tin reflector and the Dutch oven do more than keep off" 
cold currents of air ; they radiate back upon the joint 
the rays darfced on them by the fire. 

For this kind of roasting, either by the horizontal 
spit or the bottle-jack, the English open grate is excellent 
The latch-pan also renders great service, by allowing^ 
small things whose flesh is tender — such as green geese^ 
spring chickens, leverets, joints of house-lamb— to lie in 
it before the fire, at suitable distances, — ^getting well 
heated throughout, and, in short, nearly cooked, by being 
turned over and over and basted with dripping, until 
their final finishing ofl^ and browning. Ducks and wild-^ 
fowl especially, so treated, combine in themselves the 
double advantage of a French aau^^-ing in a saucepan 
and English roasting. 

Roasts before the fire (suspended, or on a spit) are 
the most highly esteemed of all. There is more of the 
real flavour of the meat retained, and more gravy. The 
joint is less greasy, less dried up and stringy, and, con- 
sequently, the more digestible and nutritious. On the 
Continent, the best roasts are done on spits be/ore wood 
fires. In Paris, there are tradesmen (who sell ready* 
roasted fowls and meat done in that particular way, and 
who sometimes are also Restaurants) calling themselves 
JRotisseurSj to announce that they are not ordinary bakers 
of meats. 



BOIUNOy BOASTIKG, ETC., Aim THEIR EFFECTS, 43 

Baking is another form of roasting, only it is no 
longer done bj radiant heat alone, which is the purest of 
all modes of applying heat In tlie process of baking in 
ovens, hot air plays a vexy important part, although 
there is also the great amount of heat radiated from the 
sides of the oven, and conducted from the floor. Now, 
hot air is dry air ; it may also bo charged with smoke, 
or tainted with the smell of burnt grease, &c. There-* 
fore, to roast well in an oven requires frequent basting, 
— which cannot easily be done when the oven, is largo, 
because opening the door might cool it too soon, — and 
great care that no unwished-for flavour be communi- 
cated to the joint. Meat baked in large ovens will not 
be eaten out of choice, although, when large numbers 
of people have to be provided for, ^^ funeral baked 
meats'' may be accepted as a matter of necessity. In 
several English cooking stoves, as in the French cuisinikreitf 
roasting in the oven can be performed so well, that no 
reasonable person ought to complain of it 

Boasting in hot ashes, or amongst heated stones, is a 
primitive but effectual mode of preparation applied to^ 
roots, vegetables, and hard -fleshed fruit — chestnuts,. 
potatoes, yams, bread-fruit ; also by the Islanders of the 
Pacific Ocean to animal food. Shell-fish may likewise 
be cooked in that way. In this case, heat is directly 
communicated by contact. In modem cookery, it is 
represented by the small iron ovens, covered with a lid, 
in which — placed in the midst of a gentle fire, or set on 
the embers and covered with live charcoal, turf, or red- 
hot cinders — cakes, roUs, Uttle loaves, and other ^^ small

things," can bo done "twice a day,'* or oftener, to a 
verj eatable condition, with care. Such ovens render 
valuable service on shipboard, in colonies, and during 
excursions in little-travelled regions. They save the ex- 
plorer from the tmhealthy continuance of a biscuit and 
dried or salt meat diet 

Braising^ again, is a development of the primitive 
mode of cooking in hot ashes. A braising-pan is con- 
trived to have a lid which will hold lighted charcoal on 
its top. The viands to be cooked are therefore between 
two fires — one above and one beneath. The operation 
must be performed slowly, and requires great care. The 
cover must fit so closely as to prevent all evaporation, 
causing the meat to be tlioroughly impregnated with the 
flavour of the vegetables and aromatics employed ; and 
carrot, onion, parsley, thyme, bay-leaf, and cloves, are 
indispensable to a braise, and they may be increased or 
varied by chervil, knotted marjoram, celery, red wine, 
Madeira, and other flavours. Every thing braised must 
be thoroughly done, and allowed to take its proper time. 
For instance. Braised Leg of Mutton is otherwise known 
as Gigot de sept Heuresy or Seven-Hours' Leg of Mutton. 
Braised dishes may suit the convalescent and the healthy; 
but they are rather too concentrated for Uie sick and the 
sedentary. The name of the process explains its nature, 
braise being French for live charcoal embers. 

Broiling or Grilling on a gridiron is also another form 
of roasting.* It may be done over a clear cinder fire; 

* *< To Toast Mackarel, they must be wrapped in fennel, and put 
upon the gridiron, at a charcoal fire, turning them often. When

but by far the best way is to have a brick or stone 
shelf, at about the height of an ordinary table, excln- 
sively devoted to broiling, by the side of the cooking 
stove, which leaves the fire-place free for other pur- 
poses. The gridiron (a larffe one) stands on tliis shelf, 
and under it is spread a sufficiency of live charcoal 
to do the broiling required. Moreover, the gridiron 
may have over it, high enough not to impede the cook's 
proceedings, a tin funnel-shaped chimney (communi- 
cating with the kitchen chimney), to cany off the car- 
bonic-acid gas from the charcoal, and the smoke from 
any fat that may fall upon it. 

Broiling over, like roasting before, the fire, is almost 
entirely effected by radiant heat, although a small quan- 
tity of hot air or gas does rise from the burning char- 
coal. It is the closeness of the fire to the meat which 
makes its operation so efficient If expertly done, broiled 
food is amongst the wholesomest; and Toasting and 
Broiling are the same — one being done vertically, the 
other horizontally. Broiled things, with proper atten- 
tion to the fire, are entirely at the cook's command, 
and open to her observation. There need be no burning 
— ^no drying-up and cooking to rags — no serving raw. 
There may be just as much, or as little, seasoning as 
agrees with individual tastes. Gravies and sauces, if 
required, can be served in addition ; and, for a small 
party, nothing is easier than to send up hot Fish

lids broiled than fried. They are cooked in nothing 
but their own natural juices ; and it is much easier to 
add a little butter than to take away grease. Before 
putting any thing to broil, the gridiron should be heated, 
and its bars rubbed with dean paper or a dean T9Lg. 
Grilled meats should be turned frequently, and not onoe 
only, to keep the gravy inndey and not send it on one 
{the upper) side ; nor should they be too thick, which 
would prevent their being done quickly. Fish will not 
bear so many turnings ; but most fish are broiled with 
their skin on, which retains their juices — a protection 
which chops and steaks have not 

Bcilvng would be a comparatively modem operation, 
consequent on the discovery of pottery or other vessels 
that will stand the fire. The very name of boiling 
implies that it is cookery e£fected by immersion in 
boiling water ; and nothing, at first sight, could appear 
to be simpler. But all water does not boil at the same 
degree of heat ; and the same water does not boil at the 
same degree of heat at difierent levels above the sea 
or the plain. Boiling sea-water is hotter than boiliog 
river- water; and river-water, boiling at the top of Mont 
Blanc, is not hot enough to cook a potato. But, leaving 
out of consideration uninhabited portions of the earth's 
surface, meat and vegetables take longer to boil up 
in the city of Mexico than they would do down at Vera 
Cruz, on the coast. The cook will, therefore, at once 
perceive that she can turn Boiling to sundry purposes, 
merely by boiling gently with rain or river- water, and 
by boiling fiercely with salt and water. 



BOnjKG, BOABTUSQy ETC., AND THEIR EFFECTS. 47 

Moreover, the substances which serve as our food 
are differentij acted upon by different degrees of hot 
water. Take, as an easy example, an egg. Put it on 
die fire in a saucepan, with cold water; let it heat 
gradually and slowly; and you will find that the yolk is 
set b^cre the white, and also before the water boils. 
The white becomes fixed soon afterwards, and at the 
temperature of scarcely boiling water. You will there- 
fore employ quite a moderate degree of heat for sauces 
thickened with yolk of egg, while a very little more 
heat will serve for dishes composed of the whites and 
yolks together. You understand why, if baked custards, 
rice-puddings, and the like, bail in their baking dish, 
they are ruined, running into whey ; why boiled custards 
and creams wntaining eggs should be done in a batn- 
marie^ or jar immersed in a saucepan of hot water ; why 
an omelette, left long enough in the pan to get penetrated 
by the heat of the butter in which it is fried, becomes 
leathery. Hard eggs, for salad and garnishing, may 
boil galloping in salt and water. Eggs boiled in the 
shell, for weak digestions, may be dropped into boiling 
rain-water, set on the side of the stove five minutes, and 
never allowed to boil again. Quick boiling converts 
the white into something very like gutta-percha, even 
though the yolk is not yet hard. 

In setting about boiling, the cook has first to deter- 
mine whether she requires the juices of the articles 
boiled to remain in them^ or to be communicated to the 
water. Fresh vegetables intended to be served alone, 
fish, and meat which appears on the table as a boil, 



48 OPERATIONS. 

should be tlirown Into boiling water with a little salt in 
it, to harden their outer cuticle, set the albumine (or 
substance similar to white of egg) they contain, and 
so cause them to retain their native succulence, instead 
of letting it ooze out into the boilings. For the contrary 
reason, the ingredients of soups and stews are to be set 
on with the water cold. Salted and dried meats and 
fish, which it is required should swell in cooking, must 
be put into cold water (after previous steeping), and 
boiled very slowly. Dried vegetables, — as peas, haricots, 
rice, &c., — after steeping all night in Boft water (which 
first water is to be tlirown out), are to be set to cook 
in cold soft water. The best water for this purpose is 
filtered rain-water, from a tolerably clean roof, or pure 
river-water, which has stood to settle twelve hours: 
neither easy to obtain in large towns. Hard spring 
or pump water (mostly containing salts of lime) may 
be soft;ened by putting into it a little carbonate of soda, 
in the proportion of half an ounce to every gallon of 
water. 

Boiling gives little trouble. Careful skimming, soon 
after the pot boils ; attention that nothing stick to the 
bottom, and so give a bad taste of burnt to the whole ; 
watching that every thing is covered by the water all 
the while, and not left half-dry by evaporation; and 
regulation of the rate of boiling required for that par- 
ticular object, — are the essential points. Boiling is the 
only way of cooking many vegetables. To keep them 
green, use soft water, throw them in when it boils, and 
let them remain uncovered by a lid till done. It is. 



BOILING, ROASTING, ETC., AND THEIB EFFECTS, 49 

also, an economical way of cooking meat ; for if the 
broth be not wasted, as it too often is, nothing is wasted. 
In Provence, even fish boilings are careftiUy saved, for 
the making of bouUlabatssey and other fish-soups. 

Steaming is, in point of fact, boiling in the heated 
vapour of water. The practice, as a means of cooking, 
is somewhat local, depending on tlie appliances at hand 
and the particular articles of food required to be so 
prepared. In Norfolk, where dumplings are a staple 
item of the popular diet, almost every body has a steamer 
fixed to the top of their largest saucepan. Steamed 
dumplings are much lighter, drier, and more inviting 
in their appearance than boiled. Many puddings, and 
some vegetables, may be steamed advantageously. A 
steamed leg of mutton is excellent; tender, full of gravy, 
and hardly by a possibility over-done. But all steamed 
things take much longer to cook than boiled, involving 
an extra consumption of fuel, which is serious in some 
localities. Steaming, too, is not only slower than boiling, 
but more uncertain ; if the water supplying the steam 
ceases to boil faat^ tlie cooking does not go on at all. 
Dumplings and puddings turn heavj-, and meat remains 
raw. Steamed meat also gives no broth ; almost all the 
broth remains within it ; consequently, when it is done, 
it is delicate, nutritious, savoury, and easy of digestion ; 
highly recommendable, in short, to invalids whose cook 
lias the patience to bestow hours after hours upon a joint. 

Stewing^ another modification of boiling, is especially 
open to the observation, ^Hhe more haste, the worse 
speed.'' It is an eminently economical branch of cook-

ery, Bj it, coarse joints, old poultry, hard portions of 
animals, feet, gizzards, tendons, and even bones, are 
made to supply savoury and v^holesome nutriment. 
Time and slow eooking are the secret of success ; if a 
thing cannot be stewed tender in one doing, it must be 
done in two or three, supplying as required, from time 
to time, the moisture absorbed and evaporated. Yege- 
tables, sweet herbs, and spices, have thus the time to 
yield all their flavour, from the longer period during 
which they are subjected to heat ; and it must not be 
forgotten that all those things are absolutely medicinal 
in their effects on the constitution, as well as stimu- 
lant to the appetite. If vegetables generally are a 
specific against such a severe disease as the scmrvy, it 
cannot be doubted that their special virtues have their 
influence in milder ailments and on the general health* 
The old faith in ^^ simples'' was by no means a mistake ; 
«d for persons sufferLg from Ij decided form of Ul- 
ness, the best simples are those which grow in the kitchen- 
garden. Even when medicine derived from plants is 
prescribed for a patient, culinary vegetables render 
useful assistance, which is all the more pleasant because 
it is unsuspected. Stewing enables the qualities of 
vegetables to enter the system in the easiest way possible, 
by combining them with the fleshy and gelatinous 
substances which they are employed to season. They are 
thus digested and assimilated unconsciously; whereas, 
under another form — ^that of salad, for instance— weak 
stomachs could not digest them at all. Baw lettuce and 
endive, uneooked onions, celery, artichokes, finocohio

(tabercnlons-rooted fennel), encambers, chicoiy, rad- 
ishes, tnmips, are all eaten with relish in that state bj 
many who can, and bj not a few who cannot, digest 
ihem. Stewed, thej possess the same sanitary virtnes, 
without imposing impossibilities on the labouring sto- 
mach, and, consequently, deranging the nerves and the 
brain. Stewing, like soup-boiling, is begun with the 
water cold. When it boils, skim till no more scum rises ; 
after which, let it only simmer. Stewing may be done 
in various vessels (not too small), thick rather than thin 
in substance, with a cover which vnll fit eloselt/y but can 
be easfly removed to see how the stew is going on. 
Earthen pots stew capitally, because they are long about 
it. '* Sweating" and " suffocating" meat are expressive 
French terms for stewing it. Iron pots allow the heap- 
ing of fire on their lid; the stew then approaches to a 
daube or braise. Papin's digester (which, by means of 
pressure, obtains a higher temperature tiian boiling water, 
and extracts all the nutriment out of bones) is really an 
improved stewpan. 

Frying might be called *' boiling in fat or oil" — ^which 
are synonymous in a culinary sense ; for fat is nothing 
but oil solidified, and oil is liquid fat or grease — ^but the 
conditions are so exceedingly different, and the effects 
so contrary, that ^^ boiling" must be restricted to cooking 
with water at the highest temperature it is capable 
of maintaining unconfined. It has been stated that 
different waters boil at different temperatures. The same 
is true of different liquids, through a still wider range 
of heat. You can thrust your finger with impunity into 



52 - OP£BATIOKS. 

boiling spirit of wine ; you can hardly do so with boiling 
water ; while boiling oil would inflict a cruel bum. Boil- 
ing oil or fat is nearly four times as hot as boiling water. 

Consequently^ articles of food plunged in boiling fat 
offer very opposite results to what they do in boiling 
water. In the latter, they are softened and finally dis- 
solved ; they become either boiled meat and vegetables, 
or are reduced to the condition of a mess of pottage. In 
boiling fat, on the contrary, they become firm — ^at first 
on their outside only, which is more or less browned ; 
and if left there too long, are burnt to a cinder. In the 
first case, the water dissolves and incorporates with itself 
the internal juices of the food plunged in it In the 
second, those juices remain in the articles fried, because 
the fat is incapable of dissolving them. If they ulti- 
mately become dry as chips, the reason is, that the con- 
tinued heat must at last drive off all moisture in the state 
of vapour. 

It is mere economy — or, in truth, niggardness — ^in 
tlie use of fat, which makes our cooks fiy first one side of 
a chop or steak, and then turn it to fiy the other. The 
best frying is done by plunging the article entirely in 
boiling fat This is especially the case with vegetables 
and fish. How often do we see firied potatoes and soles, 
mere slices of something sodden in grease! Bailing 
grease does not enter articles plunged into it, but forms 
a crust on their surface which keeps it out The cook, 
therefore, should have a large stock of fiying-fat, which 
can be strained and poured into jars when the frying is 
done, and covered to keep out the dust, reserving each

sort for its special purpose : meat-fat for meat, fish-fiit 
for fish, yegetable-&t for vegetables, as potatoes, sliced 
turnip, split cucumbers, small vegetable-marrows. A 
well-stored kitchen should have another pot of fat re- 
served for sweets, as apple or peach fritters, sweet 
omelettes, &c. 

The causes of fiulnre in fiying are : Ist, an insufficient 
quantity of fat in the pan ; 2d, putting in things to fiy 
before it is hot enough ; 3d, too much moisture adhering 
to the sur&ce of things to be fiied. 

Vegetables and fish should be carefully wiped dry 
before frying; the latter may be rubbed with flour; 
chops and cutlets may be smeared with egg, and 
dusted all over with bread-crumbs or grated biscuit 
The grand point is to get the boiling fat to seize the 
article fried, ue. to form a brown crust all over its 
surface at the very instant of immersion. Tlie seizing 
cannot take place unless the fat has been over a sharp 
fire a sufficient time ; when once the seizing is properly 
effected, the pan may be raised or withdrawn a little, to 
let the article cook through without burning outside. 
That the fat is hot enough may be ascertained by trying 
it with a piece of crumb of bread thrown in for five or 
six seconds. If it comes out crisp and brown, you may 
commence your operations at once. Well-fried things 
are not greasy ; they are agreeable to the eye, the palate, 
and the stomach : while badly fried things are the very 
reverse. A well-fried sole will hardly soil the napkin 
on which it is laid. 

Flying in this style affords great resources for the

table. It allows yesterday's leavings to reappear In quite 
a novel form, and helps you out of the difficulty of an 
unexpected arrival; for it takes no longer to firy thus 
a four-pound fish than to boil an egg. When the &t 
is once at seizing point the thing is done. A famous 
epicure, Brillat Savarin, once had a pan made (which 
he christened an enfer) big enough to fry in this way a 
very large turbot 

The kind of fat used must depend on local circum- 
stances ; whatever it is, it must be the very best of its 
kind. Good olive-oil is delicate; so is good butter; 
first-rate and sweet pork-lard is not to be despised; 
beef and veal melted suet will render service for many 
' things. 

The frying-pans commonly sold are much too shallow, 
being only just deep enough to fry eggs, or cutlets, and 
flat-fish, by turning them over. Every kitchen should 
possess a frying-pan not less than six inches deep, oval, 
not round, and long enough to accommodate a respect- 
able-sized fisL 

Sautding resembles what is erroneously called fiying, 
only it is not done in a frying-pan, but in a deep (often 
an earthen) pan, into which a moderate quantity of 
butter or fat is put When this is hot, the article to be 
cooked is shaken about in it, tossed, and turned, until 
properly done. As in frying, the heat of the fat is an 
essential point ; the cook never leaves the article to itself 
a second. Things larger than a duck are seldom saut^ : 
sauted potatoes are general favourites. Omelettes and 
pancakes are really sauted, so are chops and steaks in

general ; wliile beignets and fritters should be fried. In 
aautfing, as in frying, the great danger to be avoided 
is over-doing the artiele, partieularly if it is onlj a 
preliminary in the cooking of a dish. It may be per- 
formed very well in an ordinary shallow saneepan. The 
term is derived from the French sauter^ to jump, or /aire 
tauter J to make jump, to toss* Things commonly sant&l 
are yonng fowls, small game, larger poultry or game in 
joints, meat in dice or small pieces, kidneys, sweet- 
breads, small potatoes whole or large ones sliced, por-

KITCHEN REQUISITES, AND THEIR EMPLOYMENT. 

When a cook arrives at a new place, it is only fair 
that she should find ready to her hand every implement 
and convenience necessary for the proper exercise of her 
art, or at least for the preparation of the class of dishes 
which her employers are likely to require of her. As 
in other arts, a handy person will effect a good deal witli 
few appliances. Still, there must be a mrfficiency of 
utensils. Tlie following list, therefore (which might be 
enlarged), is given, not to tell housekeepers that they 
must at once purchase every article which it contains, 
but ratlier as a remembrancer of what they may want, 
and what they think their own cook ought to have at 
command in order to sen^e their meals to their satisfac- 
tion. If they have to complain of an ill-dressed dinner, 
they would not wish her to be in a position to reply, 
" Sir (or Ma'am), I could do no better, because I had 
not the things to do it with." 

But while the kitchen battery ought to be fully 
adequate to carry on the culinary campaign, tlie pur- 
chase' of a superfluity of utensils is a great mistake, 
and that not so much on account of the expense of the 
outlay, as of the time and labour wasted in keeping them 
bright and clean. And yet many cooks, and even

others, who build houses, not to be lived in, but to be 
scrubbed, scoured, painted, dusted, and then kept care- 
fully closed. ^^ Pray don't order so and so of the fish- 
monger, the butcher, or the poulterer ; we could only 
cook them in such or such vessels : they are clean, and 
we cannot have them dirtied," is a request which is 
contrary to common sense. J£ the vessels are not to be 
used, they may as well be sold for old iron or copper. 
In running through our list, therefore, the householder 
will tick off what is absolutely wanted in his establish-

Jacky for roasting. A Bottle- Jacky with its reflector, 
answers well for moderate-sized families. If it be a

Gridirons of various sizes and contrivances. Tlie 
gridiron with channelled bars receives the gravy in a

therefore is not pricked by a fork. This is also avoided 
by using a pair of steak-tongs.

the possibility of their burning ; to warm up cold dishes; 
and to keep things hot for travellers, sportsmen, and 
professional people, whose hour of dining is uncertain. 
Turtle, ox-tail, and such-like soups, when once made, 
should always be heated up again in a bain-marie, which 
not only saves the meat, &c from sticking to the bottom, 
but preserves the delicacy of the flavour. A common

knife employed is a matter of individual habit and 
custom. The writer employs an old, well-worn, stiff, 
sharp-pointed dinner-knife, and is not alarmed at the 
sight of a barrel from Colchester, nor of two. There 
are machines for opening oysters ; but, not having tried

ELEMENTS. 

FIRST MATERIALS AND COMBINATIONS, ON WHICH ALL 
COOKERY IS BASED; WITH IHNTS FOR THEIR PRE- 
PARATION AND USE. 

" Broth," says Ude, " is the Foundation of Cookerj." 

" Cookery," would say many English professors, 
" rests mainly on a basis of Melted Butter." 

" The first Element of Made Dishes," others might 
suggest, ^^ is a good Roxix^ as the French call it, or 
Flour browned in Butter at the bottom of a Stewpan." 

All w^hich maxims are true to this extent, that if 
either of the articles to which they relate is bad, not only 
is the resulting Cookery bad, but, what is worse, un- 
wholesome. 

That admission made, it is needless to inquire fur- 
ther what is the primary cosmic element (if any) of 
which all dishes are made up and compounded. The 
above-named three elements will have due consideration 
in their proper places. We now enumerate sundry 
articles which the cook will require to have at hand, 
ready for u$e at a minute's warning. Most Made Dishes 
especially are only happy combinations of certain simpler 
preparations. A great culinary point, therefore, is to 
know how to prepare those properly, and to keep them 
in attendance in a serviceable state. 

The Bunch of Sweet Herbe^ or Bouquet^ as we will 



ELEMENTS 65 

call it for shorbiesSy serves to flavour soups^ stews^ 
hashes^ and gravies. It is thrown into them, tied 
together with thread, at the beginning of their prepa-» 
ration, and is taken out before serving. The bouquet, 
prepared, may be kept fresh in a glass of water until 
the moment of throwing it into the hot liquid. It 
is often the bouquet which (combined sometimes with 
wine or other sauce) confers their peculiar delicacy on 
certain dishes — to Mock-Turtle, for instance, Tite de 
Veau a la Tortve, hashed Calf's Head, &c. The bou- 
quet also exercises a stimulating and medicinal effect 
on the digestion. 

The foUowing sweet herbs may enter (in different 
combinations and proportions, according to the dish they 
are to flavour) into the composition of the bouquet: 
parsley ; chervil ; celery, the blanched stalks ; celery, 
the green leaf (when celery is not to be had, a salt- 
spoonfiil of the seedy slightly crushed, will communicate 
the same flavour) ; chives (unnecessary when onions in 
auy form are added); bay-leaves; common garden 
thyme ; wild thyme ; lemon thyme ; sage ; knotted mar- 
joram, otherwise called pot maijoram, because, being a 
native of the South of Europe, it is often grown in pots 
during winter; sweet basil, a tender annual of very deli- 
cate aroma. 

For those who like it, a bunch of spearmint is boiled 
with green peas. So prepared, they accord well with 
roast mutton, pork, veal, duck, goose, and wild fowl, 
but not with beef or chicken. The objection to mint 
with peas, especially if they are to be eaten alone or as 

r 



66 SLEMENTS. 

a dishy isy that it overpowers their natural flavour ; its 
recommendation is^ that it stimulates the digestion of 
what is a rather heavy vegetable, espeoiallj if often eaten. 

The French in like manner boil a bunch of sar^ 
rietUy summer savory (^Satureja hortensis^ an annual 
species, quite different from the common winter savoiy, 
which is a perennial imder-shrub), with broad beans; 
and i^ is a great improvement. 

Some boil a bunch of fennel with mackarel, and also 
with salmon. Fennel-sauce may be made either with 
fennel so boiled, or with fresh-chopped uncooked fennel. 
The former will be more digestible, the latter of a brighter 
colour. 

Sage-leaf Powder. Dry sage-leaves very slowly 
before the fire or in an oven, so as to retain their pecu- 
liar gray-green hue. Then, while crisp, rub them be- 
tween the hands as finely as possible. Serve on a plate 
with a spoon in it (or in a neat dredger, like a large- 
holed pepper-box) for each guest to sprinkle in pea and 
other soup. Sage-powder is also used to dust over 
roast pork just before serving, or to decorate the outside 
of hams, &c. 

Parsley Powder^ made in the same way, is em- 
ployed for like purposes, and to improve boiled leg of 
pork, both in outward appearance and in flavour. 
Chervil, Marjoram, Thyme, and BasH Powders, will 
vary the above. 

They may all be kept in small wide-mouthed bottles^ 
(set in front of the fire before putting in the powder)^ 
well stopped, in a very dry closet. 



BLEHSNT8. 67 

(M>e8 are kept in pidde, in jars. When a dish oon- 
taining olives is to be served in the course of the day, 
pare as manj as are wanted (as thick as possible, and 
all in one piece, leaving nothing bnt the bare kernel to 
be rejected), and retnm them immediately to the pickle 
until the moment comes to add them to the sauce or the 
ragoUt So they will neither get diy nor discoloured. 

When Sorae^radish is likely to be wanted, either 
BB a garnishing (for roast beef, beef-steaks, boiled cod, 
or other fish) or as a condiment (a pinch to be dropped 
into oyster sauce), have a sMck ready on a handy shelf, 
to be scraped a few minutes before made use of. Old 
scraped horse-radish looks like paper shavings, and has 
lost the best part of its volatile aroma. The perfome 
has greatly evaporated, although the pungency re- 
mains. 

Butter of Gcxrlicy or Ayoli^ much used in Provence 
and the South of France, and convenient in establish- 
ments where garlic is admitted. Pound a few cloves 
of garlic in a mortar, gradually adding olive-oil, until 
ibe whole is reduced to the consistency of a paste. 

Oarlie Winey Garlic Vinegar ^ or Essence of Garlic. 
'^ I am an advocate for a small twang of garlic in 
sausages and many other savories ; which is admirably 
given by always keeping a bottle half-filled with cloves 
of garlic, covered with white wine or vinegar. The 
former is best for many things, when a few drops even 
will often give a wonderfiil finish to any dish." — CoeUbs

from their grease, held in reserve cold on a plate, are 
often usefiil to throw into a hash or stew. 

Burnt Onions or Bhek-onion Balls (to be bought 
of every good grocer or Italian warehouse), kept in wide- 
monthed bottles, are indispensable on the 8auce-8hel£ 
They supply a savory, sightly, and wholesome means 
of browning a great variety of dishes. 

Browning (of another kind). ^^ This most useful article 
for soups and seasoned dishes is, I think, preferable to 
the French Roux^ or browned flour." (The Doctor, who 
is not bigoted, allows others to express their opinions 
freely.) " Powder finely four ounces of loaf-sugar ; put 
it in a clean iron frying-pan, with one ounce of butter. 
Set it over the fire; mix it well together; when it 
begins to be frothy, hold it off the fire. Have ready a 
pint of red wine. When the sugar and butter is of a 
deep brown, pour in a little, then add more, and keep 
stirring it. Put to it half an ounce of Jamaica pepper, 
six cloves, two blades of mace, four shallots, and a 
little salt. Boil it slowly for ten minutes ; when cold, 
take off the scum, and bottle it for use. It keeps a 
long time. Great care should he taken, in making this, not 
to let it hum too much, as it spoils tlie flavour. A simpler 
kind may be made, only using water and no spice ; but 
it does not keep so well." — Coeld>s in Search of a Cook. 

This browning, in fact, is based on caramel or burnt 
sugar (the substance employed to colour brandies), which 
is often more agreeable to the eye than to the palate. 
Indeed, the flavour of caramel is not agreeable, although 
it may be covered by other condiments. 



JSLEKKSTB. 69 

Button Mushrooms^ firom the meadow or the pasture- 
gronnd, intended for sauces and ragouts, after being 
carefully wiped, may be boiled ten minutes in stock, 
taken out, and drained. They will then be ready for 
immediate use, only requiring warming up in the sauce. 
Pickled button mushrooms are employed, as taken from 
the bottle, without further preparation. Open or full- 
grown mushrooms, although dressed in various ways, 
may be advanced a step by peeling off carefully the 
thin skin which covers then* upper surface, and shorten- 
ing ihe stalk to a proper length. 

The cook who exercises forethought in these and 
like small matters will be able to send up her dinner 
without hitch or hindrance, as well as without hurry. 
She will have all her wits about her, her presence of 
mind complete. Like an able general or a first-rate 
driver, all her forces will be under her control, every 
port of her team well in hand. She will not have to 
neglect the proper conducting of one division because 
she has already neglected the due preparation of another. 
If only for the sake of her own comfort, she will be wise 
in having her work well forward beforehand. Instead 
of being hot, fussy, and feverish — which gives her a 
capital chance of spoiling some dish — she wiU be calm, 
collected, and capable of contemplating with pride the 
progress of each item of the bill of fare as it gradually 
advances to perfection. Having things ready to hand 
or not often makes the difference between a good cook 
and a bad one, especially with regard to dishes which, 
with a little attention, may almost be said to cook of

Oysters^ for sattce or made dUhes^ may be opened at 
least half an hour beforehand without injury to their 
quality. Bemove their beards at the time. Put the 
oysters with their liquor into one cup, and the beards 
into another. When it is time to use them, it will be 
found that the beards have yielded a certain amount 
of liquor, which may be added to that already with the 
oysters. 

Oysters, to be eaten in their natural state, should 
not be opened tUl tlie very last minute. At that most 
important nick of time (with a dinner at least, if not of 
a supper) it is not fair to require that task to be per- 
formed by tlie cooL She has other things to attend to, 
and ought to have assistance to open the oysters, even 
if from the master of the house himself.

tion is much divided. To prevent its sticking to the

bottom and bnming, take a sauoepan from whose inside 
eveiy trace or vestige of grease has been remoTod. 
Sinse it toeU with cold water, throw out the water, and 
do not wipe the inside of the saucepan. Put in your 
milk immediately, and set it on the fire. The thin film 
of moisture remaining between the milk and the bottom 
of the saucepan — ^which will soon become a film of steam 
or vapour — ^wiU prevent the milk firom sticking at the 
outset and burning. It toill stick and bum afterwards, 
if not taken off in time. This mode of keeping milk 
from burning might be made the subject of a learned 
dissertation. It is analogous to Professor Tyndall's 
beantifiil experiment of making a drop of water two 
inches in diameter, and moulded into a rosette with a 
pretty crimped border, dance rhytlimically upon vapour 
escaping firom its own under-surfaoe. 

In composite dishes, stews, &c., containing a varieiy 
of articles, — such as small onions, turnips, carrots, mush-

Some require twenty minutes or half an hour's sharp 
boiling; others need be littie more than well wanned 
through. If fwt prepared beforehand, they must take 
their chance as to the time they can be allowed to cook ;

cook is independent of their peculiar requirements, and

Cocks^-combs (just mentioned) are an indispensable 
ingredient in Parisian vcl'-au^vmts and other dishes. 
When you have them (from fowls supplied to jour lar- 
der), soak them several hours in cold water to bleach, 
boil them till tender, drain, and set aside for use. 

When you have them not, do not despair, on sup- 
posing that your Calf's Head Turtlewise rmist appear 
without them. It need not, if you have a little inge- 
nuify. 

Some years ago it was calculated that not less than five- 
and-twenty or thirty thousand chicken — and the num- 
ber has been enormously increased by the ftdler develop- 
ment of railways— entered Paris every morning. Ten 
thousand of these appeared on the tables of private 
families ; the other fifteen thousand fell into the hands 
of restaurateurs, pastrycooks, rotisseurs, and their col- 
leagues. But from all those fifteen thousand fowl not 
more than twelve thousand cocks'-combs, fit to figure in 
ragoiits, could be obtained ; whilst every cockerel served 
on a private table refused to yield his natural ornament. 
Nevertheless, go where you would, order vol-^ai-vent or 
Turded Calf's Head, and you had them, containing such 
a liberal sprinkling of cocks'-combs as to show that the 
supply was inexhaustible. How was that? Nobody knew 
—nobody cared to know. There were the cocks'-combs 
— delicate, tender, unexceptionable. Who wanted fur- 
ther information, so long as ignorance was bliss ? People 
of an inquiring or sceptical turn of mind — ^until the 



ELEMENTS. 73 

cat (or the oock Voomb) was let out of the bag — ^merely 
thought of the loaves and the fishes. 

A philanthropist, appropriately called Daddy (by 
which I render Phre) Leeoq, in his zeal to benefit the 
hmnan race, made a pretty little income by inventing 
artificial cocks'*combs. 

He took a palate — beef, mutton, or veal; but he 
greatly preferred the beef. After a good scalding in 
boiling water, he let it steep eight-and-forty hours. He 
then detached the flesh of the palatine vault, taking care 
not to tear or break it. Then, putting his palate under 
a punch or stamp worked with a lever, he coined cocksy- 
combs superior to Nature^s. Connoisseurs, taken in by 
Daddy Lecoq^s productions, complacently took them in 
themselves. And yet there is an easy way of distin* 
guishing one from the other. Nature's cocks' -combs 
are studded on both sides with papUlce^ or little warts ; 
Lecoq's, and his imitators', on only one. 

Beef-palates are easy to be had in London. In 
default of them, very nice cocks'-combs can be stamped 
out of the white parts of a cairs pluck. Any black- 
smith will make you the punch, if you only furnish him 
with a proper pattern; and you will be able to send 
up cocks'- combs at will, without shaving one of your 
lady's cockerels. If half the world does not know how 
the other half lives, certainly half the world does not 
know what the other half eats. 

Fat may be ofiien substituted for butter, not only 
for the sake of economy, but with an actual improve- 
ment of flavour in many savoury dishes and some sweet

ones. Beef-fat especiallj, taken in cakes from the top 
of the stock-pot and the soup-boiler^ when cold, is usefbl 
for many purposes — such as frying, making a rcfua for 
thickening, or the beginning of a ragoiit Melted down 
into a pot and covered, it will keep good some time. 
A thrifty housekeeper will never allow it to be wasted* 

Cheese-CrusiSy no longer presentable at the close of 
dinner, may be grated, and so handed round to sprinkle 
in soup, or to be used in a dish of macaronL 

Stuffing^ A. For Veal or Turkey. Grate the crumb 
of stale bread into a bowl. Add to it salt, pepper, a 
little grated nutmeg, the rind of half a lemon chopped 
very fine, some beef or veal suet ditto, some parsley 
and thyme ditto, with the juice of the half-lemon. Break 
in one or more eggs, just sufiicient to make the quantity, 
when well mixed, into a stiff paste, which will bear 
handling and stuffing into the fowl. If truffles (sliced 
or chopped) or mushrooms are added to the stuffing, 
the lemon-peel may be omitted or not, according to 
taste. By stuffing a fowl over-night (which may be done, 
except in the hottest weather) and trussing it, not only 
can it be put to the fire at a minute's warning, but the 
flavour of the stuffing will have time to penetrate the 
flesh. Turkeys are truffied days before they are wanted, 
in order to absorb as much of the aroma as possibla 

Sheriff J B. For Pike and otiicr fish. The same as

XLEMKMTS. 75 

diy meats. The same as A^ with a larger proportion of 
suet, and the addition of sanaage-meat or bacon chopped 
veiy small. 

N.B. Stuffings are often made to contain a greater 
variefy of ingredients than are mentioned here. The 
cook may exercise her judgment by using also, in ac- 
cordance with the nature of the object she is stuffing, 
chopped onions, shallots, garlic, chives; oysters (scalded) ; 
livers (boiled) ; chestnuts (boiled or roasted, and broken 
in pieces); hard eggs or various cold meats (minced); 
anchovies, marjoram and sweet basil, lobster, crawfish, 
shrimps, cold fish, &c. 

They are aU based on bread-crumbs bound together 
with egg, seasoned and flavoured as tastes direct. 

Sti^ng or Forcemeat Balls may be rolled to the size 
required, and laid before the fire in a Dutch oven to 
harden, or fried a light brown in boiling fat. 

BaUetj for frying things in. Stir water or milk 
gradually into a little flotur. Add a little olive-oil, salt, 
and brandy ; beat together, as if for an omelette. When 
you are about to begin frying, beat an egg to a firoth, 
and mix well with the above. Dip the things to be 
fried in this, so that their surface is equally and well 
covered with the batter. For frying sweet things, as 
apple-fritters, substitute sugar for salt 

Marinadesy Piddmg or Steeping Mixtures^ are much 
used in French cookery, to give flavour to insipid meats, 
or to give a new and additional flavour to those that 
are already savoury in themselves. Their composition 
depends much on the cook's ideas and habitual practice. 



^ 



76 ELEMEKTS. 

Marinades are of two kinds, unboiled and boiled, or 
cooked and stewed. As examples, we give the receipts : 

Marinadey A. For Rabbits. Into a sufficient quan- 
tity of white wine put parsley, chives, thyme, bay-leaves, 
and a clove of garlic chopped. Cut up your rabbit 
into joints, and steep them in this mixture for at least 
an hour. Then dip them in batter, and fiy to a light 
brown. Let them drain half a minute, and serve gar- 
nished with fried parsley. 

Marinadey B. Boiled. For Fried Sheeps' Trotters. 
Take sliced shallots, carrots, and onions, parsley, three 
or four cloves, thyme, and bay-leaves. Fry them in 
butter, without letting them brown. As soon as they 
begin to brown, moisten with half water and half vinegar. 
When the vegetables are done, season with pepper and 
salt, and strain through a cullender over whatever you 
wish to marinade. 

Prepare Sheeps' Trotters as directed for a la Pculette. 
After steeping, dip them in batter, and fry and serve as 
directed for Babbit 

Carp, Tench, Perch, Pike, and other fresh-water 
fish, are marinaded the same way as Babbits. 

Marinade^ C. To give mutton or beef the flavour of 
roe-deer or venison. Put the meat in a deep vessel. 
Throw over it peeper and salt, ^parsley, sliced onions, 
bay-leaves, thyme, allspice or cloves, a glass of vinegar, 
and half a glass of water. Let it steep one or two 
days, according as you wish it to be high-flavoured, 
turning it frequently. The fillet from a loin of beef is 
a favourite piece to prepare in this way. When suffi- 



ELEMENTS* 77 

ciently marinaded, it is roasted. The upper part of the 
loin makes either roast or stewed beef. 

Court-BouiUotL Flavoured liquor^ for bolliag fish 
and shell-fish in. Its ingredients, like those of Mari- 
nades, vary. Into yonr fish-kettle, three-quarters full 
of water, put sliced onions, carrots, parsley, thyme, bay- 
leaves, mace, cloves, whole pepper, and any other spice 
you like, salt, a wineglass of vinegar, and the same of 
wine. When it has boiled, cook your fish in it. Sauce 
served with the fish should be made witli this liquor. 
The same court-bouillon will serve many times, — that 
is, as long as it keeps good ; only, each time, a little 
wine and water should be added, to prevent its becoming 
too strong. French cooks often boil shrimps, prawns, 
crawfish, and lobsters in a court-bouillon; but the ar- 
ticles so treated lose thereby the peculiar delicacy of 
their natural flavour: they also disagree with many 
stomachs which digest them without difiiculty when 
boiled, afi^er the English fashion, in salt water. Take, 
as an example : 

Freshnwater Crawfish^ done, French &shion, in Court- 
Bouillofu At the bottom of a large stew-pan put slices 
of carrots, onions, and parsley-roots ; parsley, thyme, 
and bay-leaves ; a few cloves and whole pepper, salt, and 
a glass of vinegar. Fill up with water, and boil well an 
hour. Strain through a cullender. 

When cool, return this liquor to the stew-pan, and 
into it put the live crawfish, after washing them in 
several waters. Take off the scum as it rises, and let 
them boil twenty minutes. When done, take off the. 



78 ELBlflENTS. 

fire, and let them remain in the liquor nntll qnite cold, 
in order to be more thoronghlj penetrated with its 
flavour. This same Court-Bouillon will serve repeatedly 
for other crawfish, prawns, or lobsters. 

CarameL Pounded lump-sugar browned in a saucer 
pan over the fire, moistened with a little broth or water, 
and stirred with a fork all the while. Great care must 
be taken not to bum it, which would oommunioate a 
bitter and unpleasant taste. When suflScientlj browned, 
it may be stored away in a jar. Its use is to smear with 
a feather over the sur&oe of meats, to glaze or colour 
them, and also to make sauces look richer by deepening 
their brownness; for there is but little nutriment in 
caramel, the sweetness being fried out of it. It is with 
caramel that brandies, &c. (white when they issue firom 
the still), are made to assume the tinge that suits the 
market 

It is clear that attention to the preceding points will 
enable the cook not only to be punctual, but — ^what is of 
equal importance to persons of delicate health and mul«- 
titudinous engagements — to servo a hot dinner or lunch- 
eon at a very short notice. Professional men are often 
obliged to snatch their meals between their spells of 
duiy ; and if, tlirough their cook's address, they can take 
twenty minutes' repose after a repast, instead of having^ 
to wait twenty minutes longer for that repast, their health 
will be incalculably the gainer ; not to mention the addi- 
tional enjoyment of being able to eat, and perhaps con- 
verse, leisurely, without bolting their food unmasticated 
and almost imtasted.

WHETS, KICKSHAWS, SIDE-DISHES, ETC., 

Abe little things which sometimes take the place of 
dishes, sometimes accompany dishes, sometimes fill up 
intervals between them, and sometimes may be regarded 
as simply condiments. The time of their consumption 
at meals, and the meals at which they appear, vary 
according to local usage. Here, they are more frequent 
at break&st and lunch than at dinner ; elsewhere, they 
hegin the dinner, or are interspersed during the dinner : 
with us, their favourite place is at the dose of dinner. 
Thus, we make a true hors cToeuvre of cheese, which,

From ihe great yarieiy on this list (whioh might be 
extended)^ it is evident that we should be wrong in 
condemning them indiscriminately because ihey appear 
opposed to plain living and a simple diet In the first 
place, they are intended to be merely tctsted^ and not to 
form a substantial portion of any meal. And, secondly,^ 
some hora cTceuvres render medicinal service by the ele-^ 
ments (needful, though it may be in infinitesimal quan-^ 
tities) which they help to introduce into the system^ 

No uncooked vegetables — such as radishes, garden-* 
cress, and cucumbers — should be used except those that 
have been quuMy grown, i^. on a hot-bed, or in a 
fitone. Out-door spring radishes are as indigestible as 
marbles; and out-door slow-grown cress rivals iron- 
wire. Water-cress must come fix)m running water- 
Sweet hors d^osuvres combine the virtues both of sugar 
and of firuit You can take, in marmalade, the tonic, 
anti-febrile, anti-scorbutic orange ; or, in jelly and jam, 
the cooling and refreshing currant and raspberry. 

Smoked and salted meats are of questionable value 
to the invalid, while dried and smoked sausages are 
more than questionable, often being the cause of heart- 
bum. On the other hand, fish in oil, salt, or vinegar 
(when the stomach can bear them) are healthier stimu- 
lants, not open to the same objection. 

Of caviare (a preparation of the roe of certain fish) 
there are several varieties, all good when good of their 
kind. The Norwegian caviare, flavoured with cloves, 
and obtained firom Bergen and other towns, is excellent ; 
the black caviare, supplied from Hamburgh, is particu- 

G

larlj delicate. An admirable preparation, based on 
similar materials, called poutarquej or sometimes &ou* 
tarqusj is made at Martigaes, near Marseilles. To the 
convalescent, whose doctor allows him light solids, I can 
recommend, from experience, as one of his first dinners, 
a Scalded Whiting, or a Boiled Partridge, followed bj 
a very small slice of thin toast, well spread with caviare. 
Top this with a glass of good Bhine wine, preferring the 
rods. The best dessert is, none at all — unless another 
bit of toast without the caviare ; but an orange is allowed 
to lie by the bedside to suck if thirsty during the night 

Fatda de Foie Grrasy from Strasbourg and elsewhere, 
need not be altogether eschewed, if cautiously tasted now 
and then ; on the contrary, the luscious morsel requires 
to be accompanied by a wholesome crust of bread, and 
calls for a sip of generous wine. Respecting the small 
quantity of truffles they contain, opinions differ ; some 
hold them to be stimulating, others not. The best me- 
dical authorities, taking a common-sense view, maintain 
tliat truffles and the like excite the system only when 
they are served at wealthy tables, and accompanied by 
more substantial luxuries. Feed a man on bread-and- 
water and truffles, and it is probable he Avill not com- 
plain of their heating effects. 

On the whole, the invalid is advised to taste and try, 
sparingly and at intervals, such of these little dainties as 
take his fancy and promise to suit his stomach best. 
Some few he may wisely refrain from utterly; but, 
with the majority, he may indulge an invalid's curiosity 
or caprice, having due regard to the grand point of 



HOBS d'ceuybss. 83 

qtiantiij. How often does a convalesoenrfl longing point 
to the element his ease requires I How often, when a 
crisis is passed, recovery commences by the patient's 
taking something he fimcies, — a mere nothing, perhaps, 
but for which he feels a craving, — one oyster, half a 
dozen hustled or roasted cockles, marmalade, milk, por- 
ter, hock, fish, an egg, or a mutton-chop I What, in 
short, is weakness, but the absence of the elements of 
strength, which it is the business of the store-room and 
the kitchen, quite as much as of the druggist's shop, to 
supply ? 

Many of these hars cToffuvres can be obtained, ready 
prepared, firom shops and warehouses in our principal 
towns. Bespecting those which cannot, here are a few 
hints ; others will bp found in their places. 

Potted CJieese. Put into a marble mortar a pound 
of Cheshire cheese cut into dice, six ounces of good 
butter, four tea-spoonftds of loaf-sugar in powder, and 
one-teaspoonful of pounded mace. Pour over the whole 
four glasses of sherry ; let it stand and soak two or 
three minutes ; then pound all finely together. As soon 
as it is well worked into a smooth paste, put it into one 
or more close-covered jars, according to convenience. 
For immediate use, there is no need to run clarified 
butter over the surface. If the lid fits well, and the 
butter employed is sweet, cheese tlius potted will keep 
good a month or more. 

Potted Beef, Take any remains of sweet underdone 
roast beef (the lean only) which you happen to have. 
Out it into dice, and then pound in a mortar with 



84 HOBS d'ceuvres* 

pepper, salt, and any other spice that is likeiL To keep, 
it must be rather highly seasoned. Anchovy, or other 
stimulant condiments, may be added. When reduced 
in the mortar to a paste, press it lightly into shallow 
jars, smooth the top, and cover it from the air by 
pouring on clarified butter, i. e, butter reduced to a liquid 
state by setting it in a sauoeboat before or beside the fire, 
or, better, in a hot-water bath. Let the butter stand a 
few minutes after melting, to clarify, before pouring it 
on the potted meat. 

Other cooked meats and game — chicken, hare, veal, 
and partridge — are potted in the same way, — ^by pound- 
ing to a paste with spice, and covering in jars with oiled 
butter. 

Shrimps (whole), lobsters (in pieces), salmon and 
other fish (in flakes), cooked and cold, can also be potted 
by salting, spicing, packing, and pressing closely into 
pots, and covering with clarified butter ; but they will 
not keep good for many days. Indeed, a jar of any 
potted meat should be finished soon after it is begun to 
be used. 

Fish are likewise potted by a quite difierent process, 
which renders them, in American language, very useftil 
and palatable ^^ relishes." 

Potted MachareL Clean your fish without opening 
them ; draw the intestines, but leave the roes and the 
milts. Bemove the heads and tails, and then cut each 
fish into three equal portions. Wash, drain, and wipe 
dry with a cloth. 

Take an oval earthen pat^-dish, with a close-fitting 



HOBS d'ceuvbes. 85 

cover; or, for want of it, a round earthen or stone pot. 
If this latter has no cover, a wooden one may be made 
to fit it. Pat at the bottom a layer of pieces of fish ; 
season them with salt, whole pepper, cloves, allspice, 
and bay-leaf; then another layer of fish ; then another 
sprinkling of seasoning, and so on. Pour over all these, 
until they are well covered, a mixtm*e of half vinegar 
and half water ; some use half vinegar and half table- 
beer, or even a mixture of vinegar and cider. Put on 
the lid, and set in a slow oven until thoroughly done. 
Let cool with the Ud on. Fish so potted will keep a 
long time, if always immersed in the liquor ; and the 
veiy bones become eatable. It affords a convenient . 
resource ; for a few pieces of fish can be taken from 
the pot with a silver or wooden spoon, laid on a small 
dish, a little of the liquor poured over them, and served 
garnished with sprigs of parsley. What is lefl; can be 
returned to the pot. 

Herring are often potted in the same way whole; 
but halved, they are more convenient to serve. SpratSy 
of course, are potted whole. These two latter take a 
shorter time to bake than mackarel. 

Collared Eel. The larger the eel, the better; a 
middle-sized one will do, and even small eels may be 
collared. Only, if several eels are cooked in the same 
dish or pot, they should all be of the same size. 

Skin your eel ; cut off the head and the tip of the 
tail ; split it down the belly from end to end ; remove 
the backbone; lay it fiat like a ribbon; wash, drain, 
and dry with a napkin. 



86 HOBS d'ocuybes. 

Lay the open eel flat on its back; Bprinklo its 
inner surface throughout the whole of its length with 
salt, ground pepper, and allspice. Grated nutmeg 
maj be added if approved, as may also a little chopped 
parsley or sage, although the latter are not commonly 
used. 

Boll the eel together very tightly, beginning at the 
broadest end, until you reach the tail. Tie it round in 
several places very tightly with a broad tape. String 
would cut the flesh when done enough. 

Put your eel, or eels, so rolled, into a pat^-dish, or 
earthen pot with a lid. Cover them well with vinegar 
and water, or vinegar and beer. Throw in a little salt, 
whole pepper, or cloves and bay-leaf. Bake in a slow 
oven. The time of baking will depend on the size of 
your eels. They must be kept, when cold, covered with 
their liquor. Large collared eel may be served in slices, 
as many or as few on a dish as circumstances require. 
Small collared eels may appear whole, afler removing the 
tape which binds them. 

Collared Meaty as Beef or Tonffue^ is done by boning 
a long flat piece ; pickling it well in salt, saltpetre, sugar 
or treacle, and spice ; rolling it like the eel, and binding 
it as tightly as possible with long strips of linen ; boiling 
it very slowly, and letting it cool for at least a night 
before removing its bandages. In slices, it makes a 
pleasant and wholesome relish.

Then mix separatelj two or three minced shallots,

CShop the veal-bones into moderate-sized pieces. 

At the bottom of the dish put a layer of hare, then 
a layer of the mixed sausage and veal. Sprinkle that 
with the mixture of herbs and spice, and then cover 
them with a few very thin slices of fresh bacon. Pro- 
ceed in the same way, until the dish is all but full. 
Pour in the blood and half a pint of white wine. CoA-er 
the whole with thin-sliced bacon and three or four bay-

and there in the substance of the pat^. Put on the

it, and cut off all the flesh from the bones. Chop it 
fine, and season with pepper and salt 

Take an equal quantity of veal, chop it fine, and 
season in like manner. 

At the bottom of your pat^-dish spread a layer of

cliopped hare, then a layer of chopped veal^ and over 
that very thin slices of bacon ; then hare again, and so 
on, finishing off with thin bacon and a few bay-leaves 
at top. Pour in half a teacupful of water to assist in 
making the jelly ; close the lid with paste, and bake as 
before. 

Similar pat6s may be made, substituting beef, calfs 
liver, turkey, or fowl, for hare. Pat6 B is more con- 
venient for picnics, travelling, and serving in slices. 
Pat4 A is more nutritious, on account of its containing 
the gelatine from the bones, and is also more highly 
flavoured. Both will keep (unopened) for a considerable 
time, and will indeed be all the better for a little keeping. 

Pork Civeeae. After pig-killing or sausage-making, 
collect the bones, break tliem tolerably small, and boil 
them in plain water till all the goodness is got out of 
them. 

Gret together any imused pieces of meat, skin, and 
tendon. Cut them up small, without mincing them. If 
the feet are not wanted, they may be used, after* being 
boiled with the bones, and their bones removed; also 
the ears and the trimmings of the head, when the chops 
or the pigs* faces are to be salted. Boil these till quite 
tender in the liquor from the bones. Season with salt, 
pepper, and allspice or mace. Pour into basins or 
moulds, distributing with a spoon an equal portion of 
the meat to each mould, and then filling up with the 
liquor. Let stand at least all one night in a cool place 
to stiffen, before turning it out of the mould. When 
several pork cheeses are made, they are best left in the 



HOBS D*(EUYBBS« 89 

moulds till wanted. Those intended to be kept longest 
can be a litUe more highlj seasoned. Small moulds are 
most convenient for serving fresh and fresh to a small 
family or new arrivals. 

CcifB^Hecd Cheese, Take the remains of a cold 
Calfs Head ; cut it into pieces. Put it in a small stew- 
pan, with the remains of the brains or the brain-*sauce, 
if an J. Add salt, pepper, powdered or minced sage, one 
lump of sugar, a dessert-spoonful of vinegar, half a glass 
or a glass of sherry or Madeira, and as much of the 
calTs-head boilings as will just moisten the whole, and 
cover it sh'ghtlj. Simmer gently, taking care that 
nothing sticks to the bottom, until the liquor is reduced 
to the level of the meat. Then put into basins or moulds, 
to cool and stiffen, in the same way and with the same 
treatment as for Pork Cheese. 

Calf*8'Head Pie may be made either with a top 
crust, like an ordinary English meat-pie; or with a 
standing crust ; or in a covered dish, unthout crust, like 
a French pat^. In any case, you will take the Highgate 
affirmation, never to eat it liot — unless you like it best. 

Plain-boil a calPs head, untU it is nearly, not quite, 
enough. When cold, cut it into strips of convenient 
length. Dust each strip separately with a little pepper, 
flour, and salt Treat the brains and the tongue (after 
peeling it) in the same way. Pack these in your pie 
or pat£ dish in layers, seasoning them with cliopped 
lemon-peel, minced sage and thyme, and grated nutmeg. 
Moisten with the calf 's-head boilings, the juice of a 
lemon, a glass of white wine, and a dessert-spoonful of

Harvey^s or Worcestershire sauce. A leetle sprinkling 
of sugar in the substance of the pie— a mere surmise 
of it, not enough to be tasted— adds great mellowness 
and delicacy. 

If your pie has a crust, bake in an oven only just 
brisk enough to raise and brown the crust, and take 
care the gravy does not boil over. If it is a pat£, lute 
down the cover with paste, as for Hare Pate. This 
pie is useful for hasty meals, repasts in railway car- 
riages, or on summer jaunts. If wanted for a very large 
party, to make two or more separate pies, the quantity 
may be increased by adding lean-cooked veal and a pre- 
pared sweetbread to the sliced calPs head, brains, and 
tongue. The flavour may be also varied by the addition 
of oysters and button mushrooms or truffles, when the 
latter happen to be sold for something less than tlieir 
weight in silver. 

Hustled Cockles. Tliose found in sand are by far the 
best. Cockles from mud-banks, without being unwhole- 
some, are less delicate in flavour, and require a longer 
time to cleanse themselves. The purcliaser, however, 
seldom knows whence the cockles come. 

Therefore, after washing them in two or three waters, 
leave them in a bowl all night, just covered with cool 
spring-water, wUItout ptUting salt into it. If sea-water is 
to be had, a mixture of half sea-water (afler letting it 
settle) and half spring- water is even preferable for the 
purpose. 

Put the cockles to bS hustled into a large tin sauce- 
pan, not too deep, with no water, and without the lid. 



HOBS D*<EnVBES. 91 

Set it on a brisk fire. The cockles at the bottom will 
immediatelj let out enough liquid to save it from burn- 
ing. As soon as they begin to warm, shake or hustle 
them in the saucepan, so as to bring them to the top ; 
and so on, till all the cockles have felt the influence of 
the heat. When thej begin to open, they are enough. 
Pour them, with their hot liquor over them, into a 
bowl or deep dish, and serve immediatelj. They will 
open still further on their way to table. Too much done, 
they are spoiled. 

If the quantity to be cooked is large, they are better 
hustled in several doings, and served hot and hot as 
wanted. 

Hustled Mussels, Proceed as above ; only the lid 
had better remain on the saucepan, to keep in the steam, 
as mussels require more thorough cooking than cockles, 
and are not agreeable underdone, although many dwellers 
on the coast eat them raw. The best mussels are those 
that have been pitted two or three years, especially near 
the mouth of a stream, which subjects them to the in- 
fluence of brackish water. Choose such as are large in 
the shell, plump in the flesh, and brilliant orange in 
hue. Mussels are occasionally unwholesome or poison- 
ous. There is no test — onion, silver spoon, or other — 
by which to know whether mussels will prove injurious 
or not Something may depend on the season and on 
their freshness, and also on the eater's individual con- 
stitution. Some persons eat heartily of mussels at all 
times with impunity ; others flare not swallow a single 
one. 



92 HORS d'(EUYRES. 

Pickled Cockles. After hustling, pick the cockles out 
of their shells with a fork, and put thein into a common 
preserve-jar, dusting pepper over them from time to 
time. Wheu the liquor which comes from them has 
settled, pour over the cockles a mixture of half liquor 
and half vinegar. Tie them down close with bladder or 
paper. Thej will keep several days, according to the 
heat of the weather. 

Fickled.Mussels. As above; only, before putting them 
into the jar, remove the bit of weed, if any, attached to 
the base of their foot, and open them slightly in order 
to see whether a little parasitic crab has not concealed 
itself within them. Those witli the crab arc seldom so 
good. If not for early use, they should be pickled in 
pure vinegar (not, however, too strong), with plenty of 
spice. Norway sends out very fine pickled mussels, as 
well as many other fish Iiors (Ttjeuvresj which are to be 
had of tlie principal Italian warehouses. 

EscargoU — Edible Snails (French). All snails are 
both edible and nutritive. Their use, and the choice of 
sort, depends on local custom. The edible snail, par 
exceUencCy is the Helix Pomatiaj of which millions arc 
annually sent to Paris from the vineyards of Burgundy 
and other central parts of France. It is also abundant 
in the valley of Lauterbrunnen and other sheltered Swiss 
valleys, where, however, it is not employed as an article 
of diet It will Uirive in England, and is even included 
on the list of our native snails. Dr. Neill had a colony 
sent from Somersetshire, which multiplied in the cre-» 
vices of a rockwork, until they were extirpated by a 



HOBS d'cbuvbes. 93 

tame heron. The edible snail is larger than the largo 
brown garden snail, with a shell of a light yellow- 
ochreons tint. Garden snails are commonly eaten in 
districts of the Continent where H. Pomatia is not found. 

The reason for giving the following receipts is not 
only because they constitute dishes regarded as luxuries 
in France and elsewhere, but on account of the old and 
very extensive belief in their restorative properties. Not 
long since a widow was tried for stealing meat, the 
principal evidence against her being the healthy plight 
of her numerous children. After very hard pressing, she 
at last avowed that she eked out her family's scanty fare 
by feeding them with the large meadow slug, which she 
collected and pickled in brine — that was the cause of 
their florid health. Certain medical practitioners have 
believed they had discovered and extracted the medicinal 
principle contained in slugs and snails, and have sold it 
at high prices under the name of ^^ Helicine." Snails 
supply the ingredient which gives its specific virtue to a 
variety of popular Cures for Consumption, which might 
be quoted were there room for them. 

Escargots are in season from autumn till spring — u e. 
from the time of their retiring to their winter's rest, 
until they resume their active life. They are eaten, 
however, during the cooler months, after keeping them 
without food several days to cleanse them. Those from 
the vineyards are considered the best. All snails are 
regarded as heavy to digest, but favourable to consti- 
tutions requiring mucilaginous aliment, and " very sto- 
machic"

spreading it smooth. In this state they will keep for a 
while, and are so displayed in the windows of Parisian 
eating-houses. When wanted, they are heated-up either 
on a gridiron or in an oven, and served on the dish in 
which they have been heated. Each guest is supplied 
with a little fork with which to extract them from the 
shell. To save trouble, persons curious to try them can

Why not call them " French Periwinkles" ? 

Periwinkles. Snails of the sea, feeding exclusively 



HOBS d'obuvbes. 95 

on seaweed, ought to possess nearly the same properties 
as land-snails, witli the additional merit (although equally 
hard to digest) of containing a small proportion of iodine. 
Boil theni in salt and water from twenty minutes to half 
an hour, according to size. They are eaten by pulling 
them out of their shells with a pin, — whence their East- 
Anglian name, ^^ pin-patches,'' — and are a very pleasant 
irelish with a slice of bread-and-butter, or a glass of wine. 
A late nobleman, whose seat is not far from the Nor- 
folk coast, used to have periwinkles occasionally served 
at dessert, accompanied by pincushions duly garnished, 
* for the use of his guesin. 

WTieUcs are moUuscivorous mollusks, preying on 
other shell-fish. Their flesh, hard and indigestible, re- 
quires long previous boiling before any subsequent 
dressing. They may be fried, and served with browned 
butter and vinegar ; or either stewed or scolloped, like 
oysters. Soyer, who did not much approve of " muscles," 
held whelks to be ^^ exceedingly wholesome fish." 

Dutch Herring are simply salted to saturation, and 
then packed in barrels with more salt The only dressing 
to which they are submitted is to scrape off their scales, 
and cut the fiesh into narrow strips, which are thus eaten 
raw, with the addition, perhaps, of a little pepper and 
vinegar. A little bit will go a long way — half a herring 
will sene one or two persons for several repasts; the 
Doctor has known a delicate invalid to call for a morsel 
of Dutch Herring with bread-and-butter, and enjoy it, 
when nothing else would suit the appetite. 

Red Herring are also eaten (as a thumb-piece) by

the Tarmoaih fishermen cold; they cannot be called raw 
after having been exposed to the action of hot smoke for 
several days. The flavour is softer than after cooking. 
Strips of untoasted Bed Herring answer many of the 
purposes to which anchovies are applied-as for sand- 
wiches, and for heightening the relish of soups. Nor 
need the custom surprise those to whom it is new. In 
Germany (before the cause of the pig disease— not the 
disease itself — trichinosis was known), on calling for 
Ham, it was usual to be asked : " Which do you prefer, 
cooked or raw ?" The raw ham was served in slices of 
more than the historical Yauxhall thinness, and few 
would suspect its uncooked state who had not been made 
aware of it For persons who cannot bear too much 
salt. Bed Herring may be steeped in tepid water four- 
and-twenty or six-and-tliirty hours. Open at the belly; 
lay the fish flat; do not take out the backbone; and 
toast, or heat on a gridiron, exposing the skin-side only 
to the fire. 

Yarmouth Bloaters should be served in the same way, 
minus the steeping. All they require is to be a little 
more than well warmed through. The best way of cook- 
ing Bloaters is to lay them, aftier opening, on their 
backs for a very few minutes on the working boiler of a 
steam-engine, which is always hot enough, and never 
too hot. Eh'gible substitutes for this will occur to the 
ingenious reader. 

Red SpratSy opened exactly like Bloaters, need only 
to be just shown the fire, in a Dutch oven ; or, better, 
in an open plate, on a ^^ footman'' or toast-stand.

Qumee Marmalade. Sweets are quite as essential as 
Barouries for the support of constitutions that are not 
robust* A few saccharine delicacies may therefore ap- 
propriately be given here. 

Many a peck of rotten quinces is thrown out to 
mingle with the other components of the gardener's 
manure-heap. The fulsome smell of the uncooked firuit 
may have something to do with the disregard with which 
they are treated; and Ihey are mostly looked upon as 
at best good for nothing but to ^ve a ftdler flavour to 
an apple-pie^ instead of affording an abundant supply of 
excellent, wholesome, and even sanative preserve. 

Let the fruit hang on the tree until one quince falls 
to the ground; then gather the crop. Pare, quarter, 
and core them; but scrupulously save every pip. The 
pips of quinces abound in mucilage, as may be perceived 
by taking one into the mouth and chewing it, when it 
will make the lips stick together as a piece of gum 
arabic would. Put the quinces with the pips into a stew- 
pan, with a sufficiency of lump-sugar, and just enough 
water at the bottom to keep them from burning. As 
the sugar dissolves and the liquor boils, continue stirring 
the whole mass. When the fruit becomes tender, break 
and mash it well with a spoon. In about an hour from 
the commencement of the operation it will be enough. 
It may then be turned out into preserve-jars ; a portion 
shotdd be put into shapes, to be used at dessert in the 
same way as bullace and damson cheese. The next 
morning it ought to be perfectly stiff and gelatinous, 
from the strong mucilage of the pips having been tho*

roughly incorporated with the wliole mass. The qnantity 
of sugar used may be rather less than is necessary for 
Other preserves. Tied down in the usual way, it will keep 
good for a long time. The medicinal qualities of this 
preparation are applicable to those cases in which muci- 
lage is administered internally ; and a pot of Quince 
Marmalade would be as agreeable a prescription to a 
dy suretic patient as a dish of roasted onions^ or a dose 
of linseed jelly. 

Quince Jelly is made in the same way as the fol- 
lowing. 

Apple JeUy. Peel, quarter, and cut up into small 
pieces, a quantify of pippin apples. Put them in a stew- 
pan with a drop of water. When cooked to a mash, put 
them in a jelly-bag, and let them drain all night Next 
morning, put the juice in a saucepan, taking care not to 
pour the bottom or sediment into it, in order that the 
apple-juice may remain clear. Put in sufficient sugar to 
bring it to the sweetness of currant jelly. Boil until it 
will jelly when cold, and put away in pots or glasses. 

Orange-Apple Jelly. When the apple-juice, as above, 
is put into the saucepan to be boiled down with the 
sugar, throw in slices of orange with the peel on and the 
pips removed. Let all cook together. On potting it 
off, let each pot of jelly contain a slice or two of orange. 
Both of the above are delicate sweet relishes to eat with 
bread. 

Btdlace Cheese and Damson Cheese are both made 
in the same way, and are both good; as, likewise, is 
the same preparation made from several other small late 



HOBS d'cextvbes, 99 

plams. When there is a choioe, Bnllaoe Cheese is pre- 
ferable. In colooTy as well as in oonsistencj, it ap- 
proaches closely to Goava Jelly; and its peculiar acid 
renders it refreshing and cleansing to the mouth of a 
feverish invalid. 

Let the fruit hang on the trees till it has been touched 
by a slight hoar-fr^si Weigh the quantiiy you intend 
to use ; and for every pound of fruit, put aside a quarter 
of a pound of sugar. 

Put your buUaceSy without water or any thing else, 
into a deep stone jar. Of course, you will have picked 
out every damaged fruit. Set the jar, nearly up to 
the neck, in a vessel of boiling water, after having tied 
double paper over the top to keep out the vapour; or you 
may set it in a very slow oven. When the fruit is quite 
soft and tender, pour it into a bowl, and remove the 
stones with a fork, but leave the skins. In most fruits 
(the black grape is a notable example) the skin con- 
tains medicinal elements which it is desirable to retain in 
beverages or preserves made from them. 

Then pour all — juice, flesh, and skins — into a wide, 
open stew-pan. Add the sugar, and boil well, with great 
care not to bum, until the whole is reduced to a thick 
paste or pulp. The time required to reduce it to the 
requisite thickness cannot be specifled, depending on 
circumstances. Even experienced persons decide by 
trying it* A dessert-spoonful, set out of doors to cool 
in a saucer, wiU tell them if their cheese is stiff enough. 
If not, it must be boiled a little longer, to cause a still 
ftirther loss of watery particles.

When done, pour or spoon it out into small shallow 
shapes or moulds — saucers for small cheeses, soup-plates 
for large ones, answer exceedingly well. To Bullace 
Cheeses intended for dessert, the blanched kernels of the 
fruit may be added ; but they are best omitted £ix>m those 
destined to the sick*room. They might choke the patient 
who sucked a piece of the cheese to moisten his mouth

Preserved Cucumbers (Swed), Choose small, short, 
well-shaped, half-grown cucumbers. Throw them into 
scalding water, and let them boil (not tender) three or 
four minutes. Take them out, pierce them with a needle 
in three or four places, and let them drain. Weigh 
them : for every pound, allow a pound of sugar and a 
pint of water. Put all in a stew-pan, with the rind of a 
lemon and a stick of ginger. When it once boils up, 
let it stand for five minutes simmering at the side of 
the stove. Take out the cucumbers with a spoon, put 
them in a jar, pour the syrup over them after removing 
any scum, and leaving any sediment there may be. Let 
them so remain, close covered, three or four days. Then 
arrange the cucumbers, one by one, in the jar in which 
they are finally to remain. Give the syrup another boil- 
ing and skimming, pour it over them, tie bladder over 
the top of the jar, and keep in a cool closet.

at first, to see that the syrap does not ferment. If it 
show signs of doing so, bj frothing, forming bubbles, 
and emitting a peculiar smell, it must be boiled over 
again.

but the rind remaining (thin-rinded varieties are prefer- 
able), and treated as above, make a very nice sweet pre-

Apple Butter (American). Fill a large stew-pan 
with peeled, quartered, and cored apples. Spice with 
cloves, allspice, and cinnamon ; being careful not to let 
one spice predominate over the other. Cover with good 
sweet cider, and boil slowly, mashing with a wooilen 
spoon, until the whole becomes a dark-brown jam, with 
no more juice remaining than suffices to keep it soft and 
buttery. 

Clouted Cream* ** I must not quit Devonshire with- 
out describing the Clouted Cream, which is peculiar to 
the West of England. The milk is suffered to stand in a 
bell- metal vessel four-and-twenty hours ; it is then placed 
over a small wood fire, so that the heat shall be very 
gradually communicated to it. Afler it has been over 
the fire about an hour and a half, and is approaching 
to the state of simmering^ the vessel is struck every now 
and then with the knuckle, or is very carefully watched. 
As soon as it ceases to ring, or the first bubble appears, 
a slight agitation or simmering, previous to boiling, has 
commenced ; and the secret of the preparation is that tliis 
simmering shall not proceed to boiling. The milk is 
immediately removed from the fire, and set by for 



102 HOBS P'OSXTYBES. 

twenty-four hours more. At the end of this time, all the 
cream will have arisen^ and be thick enough to cut with 
a knife. It is then carefully skimmed off. This is a 
great luxury with coffee or with tarts, and the Devon- 
^hire strawberries and cream need no praise. 

^^ The dairy-people in these districts say, that it is 
the most profitable way of treating the milk : that five 
pounds of butter can be obtained from a given quantity, 
where only four would be yielded by the ordinary 
method ; and that the butter is more saleable, on ac- 
count of the pleasant taste it has acquired, and w*hicli 
even its occasional slight smoky flavour scarcely impairs. 
The milk is proportionably impoverished ; but it also has 
gained a taste which renders it more grateful to the pigs: 
while it never scours them, but removes the diarrhoea 
produced by other food. (A hint for humans, as well as 
for pigs.) The skim-milk cheese must, however, be 
abandoned ; or if a little is made, it is exceedingly poor 
and tasteless." — YoucUt^s Cattle,

SAUCES. 

One of the best sances is pleasant companionship. A 
kind word will stir np the dormant appetite, while a 
harsh one will extingoish it; and, what is worse, will 
check the digestion of nutriment already taken. Such 
sauce may be regarded as Moral Sauce. 

Material Sauces belong to two classes : those which 
accompany dishes on their first presentation ; and those 
to which the duty falls of flattering our organs of taste, 
and giving to warmed-up meats the relish of freshness. 
The latter, elBTecting a sort of metamorphosis, belong, 
perhaps, more appropriately to the Chapter on Made 
Dishes. Nevertheless, some of them will be introduced 
here, being great auxiliaries to the cook, and meriting 
her thoughtful and patient attention. Nor is it worth 
while being stingy with ingredients, whose cost, after 
all, is trifling, while their efiect is great. 

We will begin with the simplest sauces, which are 
not the least usefuL 

Butter Meltedf or Oiled Butter j is more employed on 
the Continent than in England, to eat with vegetables, 
as asparagus and Jerusalem artichokes, or with boiled 
fish, as skate, scalded whiting, and so on. Instead of this, 
toe use a slice of ^/{f butter, which abstracts heat from 



104 SAUCES. 

the portion of eatable to which it is applied ; whereas, 
by using butter melted, the morsel reaches the mouth 
as warm as when it was laid on the plate. French cooks 
mosdj serve vegetables with some sauce or seasoning, 
and not plainly boiled in water, as with us. Nothing 
can give less trouble than this sauce. Warm your sauce- 
boat in warm water ; wipe it dry : put in the quantity 
of butter required, and set it to melt and heat, eitlier on 
the hot plate or in the warm-water bath. 

Melted Butter (which is not exactly what its name 
implies) is the foundation of many English sauces, and, 
in its simplest form, is an indispensable accompaniment 
to many dishes that daily appear upon a good plain 
English table. On the Continent, if you ask for melted 
butter, they will give you what you do not want, namely, 
the above, or butter simply melted and changed into oil 
by heat This latter, with a little vinegar, sometimes with 
the addition of spice and chopped herbs and onions, is a 
favourite sauce with fish, game, small birds, chops, and 
steaks. Butter thus oiled is mostly disliked in England, 
though a taste for it is soon acquired. Economical house-* 
keepers will not encourage it, as the article, in this form, 
is apt to be wastefully consumed. Abroad, to get the 
preparation which comes the nearest to English melted 
butter, you must ask for sauce blanche^ or " white 
sauce." 

The old-fashioned way of making melted butter is to 
put some cold water into a saucepan, dust a little flour 
into it, and drop in a lump of butter of a size in propor- 
tion to the goodness or richness required. Keep stirring 



on the fire always one way, to prevent the flour ^^gP^j 
knotting and the butter from oiling. When it boils x^^^ 
it is enough, and may be immediately poured into ?®" 
sauce-tureen for serving. * 

A quicker and surer way (because it never oils) 
is to work the flour into the butter with a knife or a 
spoon. Have ready at hand some bciling water; stir 
in upon the butter and flour a sufficient quantity of this ; 
pour it into the saucepan, and just let it boil up, 
N.B. Cold melted butfcer, not stale, is often useful for 
thickening. 

Melted BtUierj Irish Fashiorij is simply made by 
melting the butter in milk, without the addition of any 
flour. 

While Sauce, of the English cooks, is melted butter 
made with milk instead of water. If it is wanted par- 
ticularly rich, cream is used instead of mQk. Take care 
of burning and boiling over. 

Siceet Sauce, to be eaten with puddings, is melted 
butter, with the addition of a little sugar, a glass of white 
wine, and half a glass of brandy. You may coloiur sweet 
sauce by the addition of currant jelly. 

For Oyster Sauce, first open your fish, cutting oif 
their beards during the process, and halving the oysters 
if they are above the middle size. Carefully preserve 
the liquor that comes from them. Put the oysters into 
one basin and the beards into another ; from these latter, 
a considerable quantity of liquor will drain, and may be 
added to that which came from out the shells. Then 
proceed as for melted butter, using the oyster liquor

^e /^^ of water, and supply the deficiency with a 
\)y/le salt and water. If the sance is to be served with 
fsh, or boiled chicken, put in a Utile pounded mace and 
grated nutmeg ; if with beef-steak, a couple of pinches 
of scraped horse-radish. As soon as the sauce boils up, 
throw in the oysters, and set the saucepan on one side^ 
to let them get well heated throughout. The oysters 
must not be bailed in the sauce ; if they were, they would 
turn out tough and leatheiy. Take care not to be stingy 
in respect to tlie number of oysters you put into a given 
quantity of sauce. Almost every one eats of this con- 
diment when presented at table ; and it is better to give 
plain melted butter, than to serve oyster sauce in which 
the oysters shout to each other, like a straggling party 
lost in a wood, " Whereabouts are you to be found ?" 
Such sauce reminds one of the schoolboy's conundrum, 
*' How to make plum-pudding without plums ?" Answer, 
after giving it up, " Put in a plum." 

Cockle Sauce, This preparation, though much less 
generally known than oyster sauce, holds a place only 
second to it on the list of zests composed of shell-fish* 
Cockles are found on our sandy coasts ; carriers' carts, 
and still more railways, assist in their distribution over 
the country ; and we strongly recommend those who are 
ignorant of them in this form to make the following 
experiment : 

Well wash the cockles. Cover them with salt and 
water o( about the same saltness as sea-water, but less 
so, rather than more ; too much salt makes the cockles 
shrink instead of plumping. Let them lie in this an 



SAUCES. 107 

hour or two to discharge their sand and grit; if all night, 
and in merely brackish water, so mnch the better. When 
yon want to make year sanoe, half fill a large sauce- 
pan or stew-pan that has a close-fitting lid with cockleS| 
without the least drop of water to them, and set it on a 
brisk fire. Keep the lid down dose ; give them a shake, 
and put them on the fire another minute or two. Then 
pour them all out into a dish. Pick out with a fork 
^Jbe ^^ meats" of such cockles as are opened, and put 
hem aside into a basin. Betum the unopened ones to 
106 ^ saucepan, and hustle them again over the fire ; but 
e very careful not to overdo them. Let the liquor 
'^irhich comes from the cockles stand a minute or two to 
^^ 3ettle, and with the clear portion of it, instead of water, 
^ make some melted butter. Meanwhile, dust over your 
cockles a little pepper, more pounded mace, and an 
abundant grating of the best nutmeg you can procure. 
When the butter boils up, dash in the cockles, and let 
them simmer gently, till you judge they are thoroughly 
heated. There ought to be sufficient cockles at least 
to half fill the sauce-boat in which they are served. 

Parsley Saticey or Parsley and Butter. Take a few 
leaves of young, bright-green, fi*esh-gathered parsley. 
The plain-leaved answers as well for this purpose as the 
curled variety, which may be reserved for garnishing* 
Chop them tolerably fine, though they need not be 
minced into minute portions. Make the required quan- 
tity of melted butter. When it is about to boil over, 
throw in the chopped parsley, and keep it boiling as fast 
as you dare for one or two minutes. This, and making 



108 BAUOES* 

the melted butter with Boft water, will keep the parsley 
a brilliant green. Parsley sauoe is mostly served widi 
boiled fowls and turkeys. 

When boiled fowls or turkey come from table, cut 
up what remains into joints, arrange them neatly on 
a fresh dish, and pour some parsley sauce over the 
whole. You will thus have a presentable dish for sup* 
per, or for to-morrow's breakfast. 

For Dried Parsley (so usefrd for winter use). Sage 
Powder^ Marjoram Powder ^ &c., see Elements, p. 66. 

For Fennel Sauce^ select a good-sized bunch oi young 
fennel-leaves, gathered from the extremities of the 
shoots. Boil them galloping, for half an hour, in soft 
water, with a good pinch of salt in it Chop them fine, 
and throw them into boiling melted butter ; which boil 
for a minute afterwards. Fennel Sauce ought to be 
even more green-coloured, and contain a greater propor- 
tion of the herb, than Parsley Sauce. This is mostly 
employed as an accompaniment to mackarel; but it is 
also good with salmon, skate, gray mullet, or other ftdl- 
flavoured fish. 

Caper Sauce* Throw into melted butter a good des- 
sert-spoonful, or more, of capers, with their vinegar; 
give them a boil up afterwards. The English use this 
principally to eat with boiled mutton ; but abroad, it is 
a very general favourite with boiled fish — ^with cod, firesh 
herring, salt fish, and especially with turbot, brill, and 
skate. Good substitutes for capers are made by chop- 
ping up various pickles, and mixing them with the butter 
instead. The green seeds and flower-buds of nasturtium 



8AUCES. 109^ 

(tropcBobim) are in greatest request. Next to them 
come kidnej-beans and gherkins* All these sour sanoes 
maj have a boil up, and require to be flavoured with a 
sufficient dash of their own vinegar. 

Small capers are most esteemed. There is a large 
species of Euphorbium^ or Spurge, frequently grown in 
farmers' gardens as an ornamental plant, and foolishly 
called '^ the caper plant/' because its unripe seeds bear 
a very slight resemblance to capers. These green seeds 
exude a milky juice, which is poisonous. They should 
never be used as pickles. The unopened flower-buds of 
the Marsh Marigold (^CaUha palustris) have been recom- 
mended as substitutes for capers ; but they are nauseous 
to the taste, and probably unwholesome, belonging as 
they do to a natural femily remarkable for its acrid 
qualities. 

Bichamel Sauce. This might be called Cream Sauce; 
for it is based on cream flavoured with herbs and spices. 
It is also the same as the sauce called Veloutd^ with 
the addition of parsley and some one or more of the 
onion tribe. Crime Vdoutde is French for clouted 
cream. 

Melt some butter at the bottom of a stew-pan, and 
tosd in it a few mushrooms, a bunch of parsley and 
chives, with a slice or two each of ham and veal. When 
br6wned, moisten with broth, and let it simmer gently 
for a good hour. 

Then take out the meat, add half a pint or so of good 
sweet cream ; simmer for another quarter of an hour, 
stirring with a spoon all the while. When of the 



110 BAUOES. 

re<pired consistenoy, it is done, and may be used with 
any kind of meat except game. 

Bkhamelj Meager j for Abstinence Dishes. Incorporate 
a couple of teaspoonfuls of flour in a quart of cream ; 
put it in a stew-pan over a brisk fire, stirring to prevent 
its sticking to the bottom. 

In another stew-pan put two or three minced shallots, 
a sliced carrot, grated nutmeg, whole pepper, bouquet 
complete, and a few mushrooms. Boil these thoroughly 
in a pint of water. Then add your thickened cream to 
this vegetable broth, stirring it in gradually to prevent 
its curdling. Then strain it through a cuUender, and 
keep warm till wanted in a hot-water bath. 

N.6. In all sauces which are not meant to be 
absolutely white, mushrooms, which often are not to be 
had, may be replaced by mushroom ketchup. 

Brown Biclwmel Sauce. Cut into dice or small 
pieces some bacon, some lean veal, a carrot, a turnip, 
and two or three onions; fry them in a little butter 
at the bottom of your stew-pan. When well brown, stir 
in a little flour ; moisten gradually with good broth or 
stock, and a glass of cream ; season with pepper, salt, 
cloves, nutmeg, thyme, bay-leaf, and parsley. Boil for 
an hour, and strain through a fine-pierced cullender. 
Keep this sauce rather thin, so that the ingredients may 
have time to be thoroughly stewed. 

White Bechamel Sauce. Boil in a quart of water a 
sliced carrot, a few shallots, grated nutmeg, whole pepper, 
some mushrooms, and the bunch of herbs complete. 

While these are cooking, mix in another stew-pan 



SAUCES. Ill 

two spoonfiils of flour with three pints of cream or good 
milk. Set it on a brisk fire, and stir without ceasing, 
to prevent burning and boiling over. 

When your cream is nicely reduced and thickened, 
incorporate with it the above preparation, pouring it in 
little by little, so as not to turn the cream. Strain the 
whole through a sieve, and keep it hot in a water bath 
until wanted* 

Mushroom Sauce. Into your melted butter put a 
good table-spoonfiil^ of pickled mushroom buttons (which 
yon can buy at the grocers'), with the vinegar that 
belongs to them, and a dessert-spoonful more. 

Matrimony Saucey or Yorkshire Dip. Melted butter 
made ^^ good" with butter, a pinch of salt, and enough 
vinegar and crystallised sugar (or sugar-candy) to give it 
a decided piquancy. It is nice with batter pudding, 
steamed dumpling, and the like, and is the sauce to eat 
with Brusseb sprouts, asparagus, brocoli, Scotch kale, 
early York cabbage, white-hearted Savoy, or other deli- 
cate winter greens. 

Fish-liver Sauce. Boil fish-liver (skate is the best, 
with whatever fish it is to be eaten) in strong salt and 
water, until quite firm. Cut it into small pieces ; throw 
it into melted butter, with pepper, salt, and a dash of 
vinegar. Boil up, and serve piping hot. 

Fowlr-liver Sauce^ for Boast or Grilled Fowls. Boil 
the livers of fowls, or of ducks or geese, in salt and 
water, until they are tender, not hard. Chop rather, 
but not too^ small. Throw them into melted butter, with 
(for an ordinary sauce-boat) a tablespoonful of ketchup, 



112 SAUCES. 

and the same of gherkin or other pickle vinegar. Boil 
npy and serve. If the ketchup is highly seasoned, very 
little pepper and salt will be wanted. 

Shrimp Sauce. Three species of shrimp are eaten 
in Great Britain ; the prawn, the red shrimp, and the 
common brown shrimp. The first is never used for 
sauce ; the second, less common than the third, is often 
preferred to it by ladies, invalids, and persoiis of delicate 
appetite. It is caught in deeper water, and further out 
to sea. A very large supply comes from Great Yar- 
mouth, in Norfolk, where its presence in the Roads there 
was accidentally discovered some sixty or seventy years 
ago. Shrimp-eaters are well aware of the great differ- 
ence both in flavour and appearance between the red 
and the brown species. Both are caught at Great Yar- 
mouth, but in very difierent localities. The brown ot 
^^ flat-nosed" kind is taken along shore at ebb-tide, in 
the harbour, and in the inland waters, and is more easily 
obtainable, and for a much longer period of the year. 

The present mode and locality of the red-shrimp 
fishery was a lucky hit made by some boats that were 
employed in recovering lost anchors by a process which 
is called ^^ sweeping." Two boats, at a certain distance 
from each other, proceed up and down the Beads, having 
a loose rope suspended between them, at the middle of 
which is fastened a large fish-basket or ^^ swill," partly 
laden with stones to sink iL By these means, the place 
of the anchor at the bottom of the sea is ascertained 
and it is then raised and restored to society. But, in 
particular states of the tide, it was found that the swill, 



SAUCES. 113 

when brought to the snrface, was filled with red Bhrimps. 
The men took the hint, kept their own counsel, got nets 
made, and, for a time, had the first gathering of the 
banrest, soon to be shared with others. 

Yon are supposed to have firesh-boiled shrimps, skill- 
fully cooked bj the fisherman's wife in plain salt and 
water, and not ruined, as to their natural flavour, with 
bay-leaves, or any other ingredient of the Court-Bouillon. 
See Elements, p. 77. 

Have two small basins before you* Pick the shrimps, 
putting the meats into one basin and ihe ahellB into an^ 
ther. Boil the shells in water, until you have extracted 
the goodness from them. Strain the liquor through a 
coarse cullender, simply to remove the shells. With this 
liquor make melted butter, ^' good" of the butter ; into 
it throw the picked shrimp -meats; let them warm 
through half a minute, and you have shrimp sauce 
ffenuine. Essence of Shrimps affords a substitute which 
certainly is better than nothing. 

Anchovy Sauce* Into enough rich melted butter to 
fill a sauce-boat, stir a dessert-spoonfid of essence of 
anchovies, or a small lump of anchovy paste. You may 
throw in, if you like (but it is a needless extra), a couple 
of anchovy-fillets, preserved in oil (to be bought at the 
Italian warehouse), cut small. This sauce is excellent 
not only with fish, but with a nice tender steak. 

Egg Sauce, for salt fish, cods' tongues, cods' sounds, 
and other boiled fish. For sauce for half a dozen per- 
sons, boil three eggs <me hour. This is an American 
wrinkle, well worth picking up. '^ It may seem strange," 

I 



114 SAUOES. 

Brother Jonathan innooentlj remarks, ^^ but, for some 
reason, an egg boiled an hoar is quite different from 
one boiled five minutes." When the eggs are quite 
cold, chop them fine, and throw them into melted butter 
which is thick of the butter and thin of the flour. A 
good dash of cream does no harm. Boil up and serve. 

If the fish with which the egg sauce is to be eaten 
has not been salted, it will be well to put a lUtle salt in 
the sauce. 

Lobster Sauce. Pick, by preference, the claws, large 
and small, and the head of a lobster. If thej do not 
yield enough, you must have recourse to the taiL Chop 
them tolerably small, without actually mincing them« 
If there is spawn to your lobster, you may add that too, 
crushed or uncrushed. It will considerably improve the 
appearance, but not much the flavour, of your sauce ; for, 
to get rid of the sand in it^ which would spoil every thing ^ 
you must wash the spawn until you have rinsed nearly 
all taste out of it. 

Put all this into rich melted butter, with a leetU 
lemon-juice, a Uetle essence of anchovy, and a leetle 
cayenne. The great point is not to overpower the 
natural flavour of the lobster. Boil up, stirring well. 
This sauce should be pinky, and thick with lobster-flesh. 
The green contents of the head must be scrupulously 
put in. 

N.B. Ifyaa have boiled the lobster yourself y after picking 
the flesh fi-om the shell, you may pound the latter, boil 
it, and make your sauce with the liquor strained away. 
But if you have bought the lobster ready-boiled, with its 



SAUCES, 115 

shell smeared with oil or butter to improve its looks, it 
may be more prudent not to use the shell-boilings. 

Ix)bster Sauce^ toithaut Ldbtter. The Doctor, how- 
ever much inclined to yield to other people's tastes, can 
never read a formula for Lobster Sauce without feeling 
a pang of regret A good lobster, he holds, is too good 
a thing to hold a candle to any other fish, be he even 
torbot, sturgeon, or salmon. When he says lobster, 
he does not mean lamgouaU^ or sea crawfisL You may 
put him to whatever employment you like ; but even a 
lobster's empty shell, garnished with parsley, is some- 
times served, merely to adorn the table on which his 
flesh appears concealed by salad. 

Whenever a lobster (under sentence of degradation 
to sauce) reaches the Doctor, he invariably restores it 
to its native digniiy, and has it served with all the 
honours. Nay, he even ventures to aver, that better 
sauces than lobster sauce exist, both for turbot and 
salmon, and which bring out more efiectually the pecu- 
liar sapidity of each. But as it is useless to run counter 
to the prevailing current of public opinion, and as there 
are occasions when society exacts the presence of lob- 
ster sauce, in order to obey the letter of the law, and 
at the same time save your lobster, masters and mis- 
tresses, do this : 

Take cold turbot, not overdone. If you have no 
turbot, boil a thick, fleshy sole. While hot, remove 
the flesh from the bones ; smear that flesh, on both sides^ 
with essence of anchovies, or anchovy paste, or essence 
of shrimps. Let it cool. Cut it up, not too small. 



116 8AUOB0. 

into dice and pieces resembling those which serve for 
real lobster sauoa Dast with a leetle very finely pow- 
dered sugar. Make the sauce itself exactly as if there 
were no deception in the matter ; which deception will 
be aided if you have a little large-grained fish-roe (as 
pike or salmon) to mix with your ingredients. Throw 
in your disguised turbot or sole^ heat^ and serve, and 
you will take in the very Old Deceiver himself. 

In the country, a very likely occurrence is the arrival 
of a turbot at a moment when the Cook cannot pro- 
cure the material for making Mock Lobster Sauce. 
To provide against such vexations, it is prudent to keep 
in the house a few boxes of Norwegian ^^ Hummer- 
nudler," or Lobster Powder, which will render good ser- 
vice on emergencies. The contents of a quarter-pound 
box, seasoned as usual, after steeping in milk, will make 
a tureen of excellent real Lobster Sauce. 

Grooseberry Saiiee (eaten with Boiled Maokarel and 
Roast Pork, and, in America, with Boiled Lamb) is 
merely green gooseberries, boiled or ^^ quaddled'' in as 
little water as is sufficient to keep them fi*om burning. 
They may be served, either whole or mashed, with the 
addition of a little sugar, or without it. Some add a 
little nutmeg, but they are just as firequently presented 
plain. 

Apple Sauce J to be eaten with Boast Groose and Boast 
Pork. Peel, quai-ter, and core your apples. Boil them 
in a small quantity of water, or, better, of cider, with a 
blade of mace and a few doves. When tender, mash 
them fine with a little powder sugar. 



SAUCES. 117 

Wine Sauce^ for Boast Venison or Mutton. A 
quarter of a pint each of port wine and good mntton 
broth, and a table-spoonftd of currant jelly. When near 
boiling, take o£F the fire, and thicken with the yolk of 
an egg. 

Brain Sauce. Wash the brains thoroughly from the 
blood they contain ; tie them in a cloth, and boil them 
half an hour. Turn them out of the cloth into a basin, 
and braid them well with a spoon with some dried sage 
in powder, a little piece of butter, and some pepper 
and salt Have ready a little good melted butter ; stir 
it in with the brains, warm it up, and it is ready to 
serve. The great thing* is to have the brains fresh ; 
therefore, if the weather is at all doubtful, the brains 
had better be taken out of the calf s or sheep^s head, 
and scalded at once, as soon as the butcher brings it 
to the house. Brain Cakes, which may be considered 
as brain sauce in another form, are brains mixed up 
with powdered sage, pepper, floured and fried. 

Bread Saucsj for Turkey, Pheasant, and Partridge. 
Grate into your sauce-tureen stale crumb of bread, to 
one-quarter, or at most one-third, of its depth. Dust 
this with ground pepper and grated nutmeg ; mix well, 
but lightly. 

Put into a saucepan milk fresh from the cow, if you 
can get it, with a few grains of salt When it quite 
boils, pour it over the bread-crumbs, let it stand on 
the hot-plate a minute, and serve. Young cooks are 
apt to put too much bread in proportion to the milk. 
It absorbs the fluid, and becomes thicker and thicker, 



118 SAUCES. 

even after it is on the table. Bread saaoe should neither be 
liquid nor pasty« Experience will teach the happy mean. 

Instead of mixing the spice with the grated bread, 
whole peppercorns and blades of mace may be boiled 
with the milk ; in which they ought to stand for a while, 
if they are to communicate much flavour. The Doctor 
thinks it an improvement to boil with the milk a large 
onion sliced, or two or three small ones ; or, even better, 
to boil in the milk, until tender, an onion or two, 
chopped very fine, and t^ let them mix with the bread 
at the same time as the milk. 

Onion Sauce. Boil onions till quite tender ; mash 
them fine with a wooden spoon. Add pepper, salt, and 
a lump of butter, and also (if to be served with boiled 
meats) a little milk or cream. Betum to the saucepan, 
and give a final heating. This sauce may be made 
smoother, for those who prefer it, by squeezing it 
through a large-holed cullender. It is not every one, 
however, who likes what he eats to bear the traces 
of such lengthy manipulation. 

Horse-radiah Saucej ^, to be eaten cold with hot 
Roast Beef, is composed of cream, a little salt and 
vinegar, and horse-radish scraped very fine. It should 
be prepared several hours before wanted, to extract the 
flavour of the root. 

Another mode is, to scrape a stick of horse-radish 
clean, to cut it into short lengths, and boil it in water 
until quite soft. Then add lemon-juice, salt, and cream. 
In a cool place, this will keep two or three days ; in 
winter, somewhat longer.

Hone-raditik Sauce^ B (Gkrman). To be eaten 
with boOed Meat. Do not scrape the horse-radiflh until 
immediately before it is wanted. Throw it into boiling 
sweet cream. Add a litde salt, one spoonfiil of sogar, 
a few currants, and, just before serving, a spoonful of 
good rich gravy, with the &t belonging to it 

Be cautious in your dealinirs with horse-radish ; it

A dear relative of the Doctor^s, whenever roast be^was 
served at her table, had a small plate of scraped horse- 
radish for her private use, of which she used to tmeU 
only while eating her meat It was an application, 
though with a different view, of the miser's maxim, ^^ Eat 
your bread, and smell of your cheese.'' 

Tomato Sauce^ from fresh tomatos. After boiling 
until quite tender, mash, and squeeze through an iron- 
wire sieve fine enough to intercept the skins and the 
seeds* Boil up again, adding a little butter, pepper, 
and salt 

For winter use, it is better to employ imported to- 
mato sauce, sold in wide-mouthed bottles. Home-grown 
tomatos are valuable as supplying an elegant dish of 
vegetables ; and home-made tomato sauce is apt not to 
keep. Tomato sauce goes well with roast mutton, 
mutton-chops, hashed calfs head, roast veal and pork, 
veal and pork cutlets. 

Mint Sauce. Pick young mint-leaves from off the 
stem. [When spear or garden mint is not to be had, 
the wild peppermint of the marshes is equally aromatic] 



120 SAUCES. 

Chop them fine, and infuse them In cold vinegar, with a 
sufficiency of soft sugar. This should be made several 
hours before it is wanted ; and, if kept close bottled in a 
cool place, will continue good for several months. It is 
intended for roast lamb, but is equally good with roast 
mutton and veal. 

Sweet^herb Sauce^ for boiled calfs head, when the 
brains, instead of being made into sauce, accompany the 
head together with the tongue. Put into a large sauce- 
boat parsley and chervil minced very fine; you may 
add, if approved, minced chives, tarragon, marjoram, 
and basil, all or either. Cover with cold vinegar, and 
let infuse two or three hours. 

Universcd Sauce. Set over a very slow fire a sauce* 
pan containing broth, white wine, bay-leaves, salt, 
pepper, and lemon-peel. Let it simmer (or rather make 
a hot infiision) four or five hours. When you strain 
it ofi*, add the juice of a lemon, and bottle. 

Celery Sauce^ for boiled turkey, fowls, ducks, and 
geese. Cut the white parts of celery into half-inch 
lengths ; boil them till tender in some light-coloured 
broth, such as that from veal or chicken. Take out the 
celery, and mince it fine on a dish, so as to retain all the 
liquor that comes from. it. 

To the liquor in which the celery has been boiled, add 
milk or cream and a little flour, to make a White Sauce. 
Season quite moderately with pepper and salt; the 
flavour of the celery should predominate. Throw in the 
minced celery, stir weU, boil up for a minute or two, 
and serve. 



SAUCES. 121 

Piqua»U Sauce. Make melted batter, — ^with milk, 
if for white meats ; with stock, if for brown. Add 
pepper and vinegar according to the degree of piquancy 
required. The latter may be tarragon, elder-flower, or 
other aromatised vinegar. Mustard (the least dust in 
the world, for it tries irritable stomachs) may be also 
used to heighten the relish. When done, take off the 
fire, and thicken with one or two egg-yolks. This sauce 
should be thick, and very smooih. 

Blanquette SaucSy for warming up cold meat as a 
Wkiie Frieassee. Put a good lump of butter into a 
saucepan. As it melts, stir into it a couple of spoon- 
fuls of flour, without letting it brown. Then, little by 
fittle, and continually stirring, add boiling water until 
the sauce is of the thickness required. Season with 
pepper, salt, and bunch of sweet herbs. Throw in small 
onions and button mushrooms (cooked beforehand), and 
then put in the meat you want to warm up, cut into 
convenient-sized pieces. 

Sauce Paulettey Chicken Sauccy is used for all sorts of 
things that are served or warmed up White. It is 
made exactly as Blanquette Sauce, with the addition of 
being thickened with yolks of egg. Example : 

Calfs Brains a la Pculette. Take four calTs brains ; 
wash, scald, and drain them. 

Melt a lump of butter in a saucepan ; stir in tho- 
roughly a soup-spoonful of flour. When well mixed, 
add gradually, stirring all the while, a teacupful of clear 
broth and half that quantity of white wine and water. 
Put in, first, small onions and mushrooms, to cook till

juice of a lemon, pour it over the brains, and serve hot 

Maitre cCHStel Sauce^ StewarcTs Sauce^ Ay is nothing 
more than oiled butter mixed up with chopped parsley, 
pepper, salt, and lemon-juice, or in default thereof with 
a dash of vinegar. Nor are the lemon-juice or vinegar 
always employed. 

For the convenience of readiness, you may prepare 
the butter thus ; it will be at hand whenever you want 
to do any thing h la Maitre d^ Hotel. 

Into a quarter of a pound of fresh butter work a 
heaped table-spoonful of chopped parsley, the juice of 
two lemons, half a teaspoonful of salt, and a dust of 
ground white pepper. Braid well together, and keep 
cool till wanted. 

According to the Doctor, things done a la Maitre 
dT Hotel are no great things : they are acceptable, pass- 
able, by way of a change, or for want of better ; but not 
things to beg and pray for. Example : 

Potatoes h la Maitre d^HdteL Slice cold potatoes, 
put them in a stew-pan with the above sauce, or prepared 
butter ; warm through, and serve. Tlie same pro- 
ceeding with other things — ^vegetables, cold fish, meat,

sauce is :

and chervil or chives, the juice of a lemon, a little salt, 
and a few peppercorns. Bring it up to the boiling point 
graduallj, never ceasing to stir it in the same direction. 
Example: 

SroUed Mackarel ^ la Mattre ^HdteL Open the 
fish quite flat at the belly, but do not take out the 
backbone* Wipe them dry (not washing them) inside 
and out Dost the inside with pepper and salt, and put

skinny, and then on the fleshy, sida If you have not the 
means of broiling, you must fiy. Serve with the above 
sauce hot in a tureen. 

Sauce SoUandaise^ Dutch Sauce (excellent and very 
simple), may be summed up thus : materials — butter, 
egg-yolks, flour ; process — stir, stir, stir ! This is one 
of the little niceties which a mistress has only to see done 
once, and to do once herself, to be able to teach it to 
every cook it may be her destiny to have to instruct 

Although Cookery-Books are extremely usefiil as 
remembrancers and for reference, the best book alone 
will not sn£5oe without practical instruction in the kit-> 
chen. Many dishes which are easy to prepare, after once 
their preparation has been witnessed, would puzzle and 
discourage novices who have only printed directions to 
follow. Pastry and Confectionery in general, and cer-* 
tain Sauces in particular, are especially open to this 
observation. 

The public are scarcely sufiiciently aware that there 
are in London teachprs of cookery, who, at moderate

common dishes, with their respective accompaniments. 
Three addresses shall be given, as a hint, from the Times :

Ude's directions for Dutch Sauce — more intelligible 
than is his wont — are these : 

Put into a stew-pan a teaspoonfiil of flour, four spoon- 
fuls of elder vinegar, a quarter of a pound of fresh 
butter, the yolks of five eggs, and a little salt Put it 
on the fire, and keep continually stirring it. When it 
has acquired thickness enough, work it well, that you 
may refine it : if it should not be curdled, you have no 
occasion to strain it through a tammy; season well, and 
serve it up. Some people do not like elder vinegar; in 
that case, use tarragon or plain vinegar: but odorous 
vinegar is far preferable. 

Dutch Sauce is served hot. A cold sauce, whose 
success mainly depends on the sttrrin^, and which every 
good cook ought to be able to make to perfection, is : 

Mayonnaise Sauce. Preliminary N.B. In making 
any cold sauce into which oil enters, be careful to add 
it little by little, almost drop by drop, continuaUy stirring 
all the while. 

Put into a salad-bowl (for the convenience of mixing) 
a couple of egg-yolks, a little pepper and salt, and a spoon- 
ful of tarragon vinegar. [It is the turagon which is the 
secret of the ^vour of the Mayonnaisef as the beating is 



8AUGBS. 125 

of its creaminess.] Mix well wilih a fork ; drop in a* 
little first-rate olive oil, and mix again* Bemember that 
this sauce, to have it delicate, requires a large amount of 
patience ; you cannot make it good in less than a quarter 
of an hour. Keep whisking with a whisk, or beating 
with a fork ; and adding first a little salad-oil, and then a 
little tarragon vinegar, and then oil and vinegar again, 
oontinnallj whisking and beating until it forms a white, 
smooth sauce, to all appearance like a cream. Coolness 
assists the making of this sauce, which should have the 
lightness of froth without the least oiliness ; in fact, no one 
should guess that oil had entered into its composition. 

Directions for special mayonnaises will not be given, 
because the putting them together is an efibrt of taste 
which must be seen to be imitated. The principal ar- 
ticles BO served are. Lobster and Crab^ Cold Fowl or 
Winged Game^ Cold Salmon^ Tw*boty Eel; but any cold 
fish or delicate meat may be similarly treated. 

The usual arrangement of a mayonnaise is : Place 
your article, in slices or small joints, in the-centre of a 
dish, perhaps on a bed of the most delicate salad you 
can get (for Salad also is an essential ingredient in 
a Mayonnaise). Cover these, partially or completely, 
with the Mayonnaise Sauce. Ghunish the whole, in the 
most fanciful way you can devise, with the hearts of 
lettuces cut in quarters, crawfish, prawns, pickled 
shrimps, strips of anchovy, capers, hard eggs in quarters, 
olives (with their kernels removed), pickled beetroot, 
nasturtium flowers, bits of savoury jelly, bits of the 
article of which the Mayonnaise consists ; in short, with 



126 SAUCBS. 

anj thing that can add to the elegance and pleasing' 
appearance of the dish* 

Tartar Saitce belongs to the same class as MaytynawMe^ 
but is more highly seasoned and is less beaten up. 

Put into your salad-bowl minced parsley and chervil^ 
tarragon and chives, pepper, salt, a little cayenne, a hard«* 
boiled yolk crushed, two raw egg-yolks, a little mustard^ 
and a few chopped gherkins or capers. These sea- 
sonings may be varied according to taste. Mix well 
together; add tarragon vinegar; and keep dropping 
salad-oil from a cruet in one hand, while you are 
mix-mix-mixing with the other. This sauce should 
be thick, pungent, yellow, and slightly speckled with the 
chopped herbs and pickles. 

Poor MavLS Saucej A. Warm up a breakfast-cup- 
ful of good stock with a slice of lemon and a tablespoon** 
ful of chopped onions. Boil a quarter of an hour, or 
till the onion is tender ; take out the lemon, and serve. 

Poor Man^B Sauce, B^ Throw into boiling water 
parsley-leaves, chopped shallots, an onion, pepper and 
salt, a spoonful of vinegar, and boil till the shallots are 
tender. This sauce, made in sufficient quantity, is em- 
ployed as a Court^BouiUon to boil several kinds offish, 
shrimps, and prawns. 

Poor Man^s Sauce, C. Boil the ingredients of B 
in good broth; take out the parsley and onion when 
done ; thicken with yolk of egg, or cold melted butter 
which has been left, or with a dust of flour. This sauce 
is useful to warm up yesterday's remains of meat or 
potdtry.

Srown Sauce, Make a roux (see next receipt). The 
time joa will let it be on the fire will depend on the 
degree of colour yon wish to give to joor sauce. While 
stirring it, add gradually good broth, pepper and salt. 
If to be served with vegetables, jou can put in a bouquet 
of parsley while it is doing; but it is evident that, in 
making this Brown Sauce, you can give it whatever 
flavour you please. Hence its usefulness and its whole- 
someness. 

The Roux — Flour Browned in Butter. This, one of 
the grand elements of French cookery, demands special 
attention. In the first place, we shall adopt the word; 
and instead of directing, ^^ Put butter in a saucepan ; 
when it is, Ac. &c.,*' simply say, " Make a nwta?" (pro- 
nounce rooj exactly as in the English word roovn). No 
language is so perfect in itself as to be independent of 
every other ; and to object to the use of foreign words, 
when employed for convenience, and not through afiecta- 
tion, is simply absurd and childish. The French have 
adopted many English words, for which their language 
had no equivalent : coal-tar ^ sporty (railway) wagon^ boule- 
doffy redingote (riding-coat, frock-coat), boulin-griny and 
others ; and we may be permitted to make similar re- 
prisals whenever circumstances render it needfuL 

Scua is literally '^ red.** Un roux and une rousse are 
the words employed to denote a red-haired man and 
woman. 

To make a Bouxy put into a stew-pan a piece of butter 
proportionate to the quantity to be prepared. Let it 
heat gradually : when on the point of boiling, add the 



128 SAUCES, 

quantiiy of flour requisite to bring it to the thickness jou 
want, and stir it round rapidly, so as to thoroughly 
amalgamate the flour with the butter, till it be of the 
proper colour, which must be obtained by slow degrees. 

The r(mx so made will keep for some time ; but it 
is usual with cooks to make their roux as wanted for the 
basis of any dish. It need not necessarily be made with 
butter ; other kinds of fat or grease will serve. For 
instance, to hash mutton, you may make your prelimi- 
nary Tcux with the fat from the gravy of the cold roast 
mutton ; the same of veal or poultry. 

By a contradiction of terms, there is also a Wh{U 
Roux^ or Whiie Tldckeninffj which Ude calls an indis- 
pensable article in cookery, serving not merely for White 
Hashes and White Dishes in general, but also to thicken 
sauces. To make it, put a lump of butter into a stew- 
pan ; when melted, throw in two or three spoonfuls of 
flour, enough to make a thin paste. In a quarter of an 
hour it will be done ; but great care must be taken not 
to let it colour. It will keep for use in an earthen 
pot 

To have a light'-brown or a darh'brotDn roux^ you 
leave it on the fire imtil it has acquired the colour 
desired. 

For a white rcuxy you stir rapidly, and do not let it 
get hot enough to acquire colour. It is a nice and 
delicate operation. 

With a roux made for immediate service, you arrest 
the colouring at the point desired by pouring in hot 
water or broth. It is evident that for making rago&ts 



8AU0XS. 129 

of dark meats, as daok, goose, and hare, jon would 
employ a browner roua than for hashed roast veal or 
tnrkey* 

When a cook has got her hand in at tossing up a 
rauxy we maj say to her : '^ Qo on, and prosper.'' 

Sauce Robert J for roast pork or beef-steaks. Make 
a roux* When it is made, add another bit of batter, and 
plenfy of fine-chopped onions ; while thej are doing, stir 
in some broth, with pepper and salt Let it simmer gen- 
tly for twenty minutes. Add a dessert-spoonful either 
of plain or tarragon vinegar, and a very small quantity 
of ready-made mustard: mix well, and serve boiling hot. 

Provenfole Sauce. Put in a stew-pan three dessert- 
spocmfuls of best salad-oil, mushrooms and shallots 
chopped fine, three cloves of garlic cut in quarters, 
pepper, salt, and bouquet of herbs. Set it on the fire ; 
dust in a spoonfed of flour, and moisten gradually widi 
half broth and half white wine. When thoroughly min- 
gled, let it simmer gently for half an hour. Take out 
the bouquet, and serve. If you wish to take out the 
garlic also, you must leave the doves whole, in order to 
be able to find them. 

Baviffote Sauce, Take all the sweet herbs to be had 
at the season — ^altogether a good handful — ^parsley, cher- 
vil, tarragon, tender green celery-leaf, bumet, cress — • 
chop them up very fine ; put them into a stew-pan with 
broth, pepper, salt, and vinegar ; boil them for twenty 
minutes. Work a lump of butter into a spoonful of 
flour ; throw it in, and stir continually until all is well 
combined together. 



130 &A.ncE8. 

The MininCs Sauce. If you are short of bntter, stir 
up well some egg-yolks in salad-oil. Add pepper, salt, 
and grated nntmeg. Heat it gradually in a hot-water 
bath, stirring continually until it thickens. 

Cream Sauce^ for turbot, cod, salt fish, cods' sounds 
and tongues ; or for vegetables, as Jerusalem artichokes, 
salsify, skirrets, cauliflowers, new potatoes. Put a good 
lump of butter into a stew-pan, with a teaspoonfiil of 
flour, a dessert-spoonful of chopped parsley, a chopped 
white onion, pepper, salt, and grated nutmeg. When 
the butter is melted, and all well mixed, throw into the 
stew-pan a glass of cream or good milk. Let it boil a 
quarter of an hour, stirring it continually. 

When served with fish, its flavour may be heightened 
by a very tiny pinch of scraped horse-radish ; but that 
condiment must be most sparingly employed. A mere 
shred or two suffices to give the wished-for zest 

Salmi SaucCy for HasJies. Work a lump of butter 
into a spoonful of flour. Melt it in a stew-pan, browning 
it as lightly as possible. Then add equal quantities of 
white wine and broth, complete bouquet, two chopped 
shallots, a few dice of carrots^ pepper and salt, a blade 
of mace, and a wee lump of sugar. Let all boil to- 
gether until considerably reduced. 

Take it off the fire ; put in the juice of a lemon, and 
the pieces of meat or joints of fowl composing your hash. 
Cover the bottom of your dish with slices of thin toasted 
bread. On these arrange thd meat or the joints as soon 
as they are well warmed through. Put a tliimblefiil of 
cognac and a few button mushrooms into the sauce;

^ve it anotlier tarn on the fire ; pour it over your hash, 
and yon will work wonders. 

Our spread of Sauces might be expanded ; but more 
ihan enough have been ahready given to guide the in- 
telligent housekeeper to agreeable as well as economical 
results. Both those qualities are perfectly compatible ; 
although Sauces, too frequently, are an item with which 
Cooks and Cooker}''-Books dazzle, by their extravagance, 
employers who are not afraid of expense. Even they, 
however, sometimes crj", " Halt ! enough 1" as when 
the French nobleman diffidently objected to putting the 
•extract of fifty hams into a half-pint bottle. 

The Cuisinier Imperial tells you to roast a dozen 
ducks to make the gravy for dressing fifteen eggs. And 
such waste is not confined to bygone times. In 1861, 
for Sauce EspagnoU^ Spanish Sauce^ we are told to take 
three fillets of veal, some bacon, some slices of ham, one 
pheasant, two partridges, one old hen, six carrots, five 
onions, and six cloves, to be moistened with good con- 
somm^, and further diluted with dry madeira, cham- 
pagne, or burgundy. When those few and simple in- 
gredients were duly stewed and strained, the resulting 
-essence would be — tolerable Satice Espagnole. 

Ude's Suage, or Empotage^ a concentrated broth, is 
made in a soup-kettle, with twenty pounds of beef, a 
knuckle of veal, a hen ; " and if you have any remnants 
of fowl or veal, you may put them in likewise." This 
broth must boil down to a glaze, without getting too 
high a colour. It requires only five hours to do, and 
must be strained, if you please, tlirough a ailken sieve. 



132 SAUCES. 

Its use, when joa have occasion for it, is to nwisten cmy 
thing for soup. Beallj, it is a piiy that gold and jewels 
cannot be boiled down to a semi-liquid glaze I 

With the materials of this Empotagey a cook who 
has heard of '^ Waste not, want not/' would send up an 
ample and handsome family meal. And surelj people's 
consciences, if not their stomachs, ought to feel the 
heavy load of sauces whose lavish cost sounds like an 
offence to the Bounty of Providence. Most people, now- 
adays, would enjoy with heartier appetite simple, inex- 
pensive, yet appropriate relishes, such as : 

Sharp Saucej for salmon or mackarel. With a 
sauce-boatftil of good melted butter mix, in a saucepan, 
over the fire, a table-spoonful of vinegar and a teaspoon- 
iul of made mustard. 

Sauce in a Hurry ^ made in the dining-room for roast 
fowl or duck. Let the liver be roasted inside the duck. 
While the fowl is being carved, crush the liver with a 
fork very small. Let the servant present a small sauce- 
pan, into which you will put the liver, the juice of a 
lemon, half a glass of red wine, pepper and salt Let 
him give it a shake or two over the fire, and pour it hot 
over the cut-up fowl.

^^ Befobe I can pretend to. make Soups of any kind, 
I most make a Broth, which will serve to fill all the Pots 
I may chance to have on my Fire, either for Saupsy 
Entrees J or Entremets. 

<< To make that Broth, Fll take that Piece of Beef 
called in England the Mouth-Buttock, some Mutton, and 
a few Fowls, regulating the Quantity of Meat according 
to the Quantity of Broth I want : I'll put that Meat in a 
Pot, with a Bunch made of Parsley, young Onions, and 
Thyme, ty'd together, and a few Cloves ; PU fill the Pot 
with Water, keeping always warm Water ready to re- 
implace that of the Pot which evaporates in boiling ; and 
when the Meat is boiPd almost to Rags, I strain the 
Broth through a Napkin, to use it as Occasion serves ; 
and for roast Meat, after I have extracted the Gravy, I 
put it to boil with such a"^ Bunch of Herbs as that above-

colour all my other Broths.

female to swallow it before dinner. [Notwithstanding 
which, multitudinous French women invariably take 
wine at their d^edner,']

1863. 

" Pot au feu is the term given to a pieoe of beef 
subjected to the action of hot water slightly salted, for 
the purpose of extracting its soluble portion. BauUlony 
or Brothy is the liquid which remains after the operation 
has been completed. The flesh, deprived of its soluble 
part, is called Bouilli^ — Boiled Meat 

'^ To obtain good Broth, it is requisite that the water 
should be heated slowly, in order that the albumine con- 
tained inside the meat do not coagulate before it is ex- 
tracted ; and the ebullition should be scarcely perceptible, 
in order that the different particles which are successively 
dissolved may unite intimately and without muddiness. 

"Vegetables or roots are added to the broth, to 
heighten its flavour, and bread or pastes (as vermicelli 
and its varieties), to render it more nourishing ; it is 
then what is called unpotage; Pottage^ from having been 
made in a poi 

" Pottage is light, wholesome, nutritious food, which 
is suited to every constitution. It revives the stomach, 
imd disposes it to receive and to digest other kinds of 
aliment. Persons inclined to obesity ought to lay all 
the fiiult on the Broth they eat. 

^^ It is universally allowed that nowhere is such good 
potage to be had as in France, and my travels have con- 
firmed the truth of the statement Nor need the fact 
surprise us, for pottage is the basis of the national French 
diet, and the long experience of centuries could not 



136 BBOTHS XSD 80UP& 

do otherwise than conduce to its perfection/' — BrilUU 
Savarin. 

The Pot aufeu is the preparation which gave rise to 
the proverb : Cest la soupe qui fait le soldat — ^^ It is the 
soup which makes the soldier." Lean beef (a portion 
of the thigh) is usually employed for Broth for persons 
in healthy but by no means to the exclusion of other 
meats ; witness Henry lY.'s popular wish that every one 
of his subjects had a hen to put in his pot In the 
mountains, and in districts where cattle are scarce, 
mutton often supplies the Pot aufeu. A true Pot au 
feu is often composed of a mixture of meats, especially 
when a large party of country people have to be enter- 
tained. The pottage is made with a bit of beef, a joint 
of mutton, a piece of veal, a lump of salt pork, and a 
fowl not young enough to roast The vegetables added 
are carrots, leeks, turnips, celery, and the hearts of two 
or three cabbages. The meats are not done quite to 
rags. Afl;er the soup, the beef is served with the vege- 
tables, and pickled gherkins ; the mutton appears masked 
in caper sauce ; the veal, dished in brown gravy, makes 
B,fricandeau ; the pork is put by, to be eaten cold ; the 
fowl, aft^r boiling, is either immediately transferred to 
the oven, basted and browned (in which case it is ac- 
companied to table by salad), or else garnished with 
boiled rice, buttered and seasoned, so becoming PouUt 
au riz. And thus, with the addition of a few slices of 
ham, and a dessert of cheese, cakes, and fruit, the Pot 
aufeu ftimishes an abundant meaL 

An old pigeon, partridge, or rabbit, increases the 



BROTHS AND SOUPS. 137 

sayouriness of the broifa. The trimmings of poultry, 
giblets, roast-meat bones of "whatever sort, are also 
esteemed as of good effect. 

The meat for broth should be quite fresh ; the slightest 
taint not only injures its flavour, but prevents its keep- 
ing. It must be put on a gentle fire, with the water 
cold and containing a little salt, and never allowed to 
boil galloping. The scum is removed as fast as it rises, 
until no more shows itsel£ The vegetables, previously 
peeled and cleaned and thrown into a pail of spring- 
water, are added when the meat is about two-thirds 
done; two or three carrots, two or three turnips, a few 
leeks tied in a bunch, celery the same, a iew pepper- 
corns, an onion stuck witli three or four cloves, and 
bouquet complete. The colour of the broth may be 
heightened by a bit of burnt onion, or by balls made 
and sold for that purpose. A parsnip may be added, 
when its peculiar sweetness is not disliked. Turnips 
had better be omitted in sultry weather, as they hasten 
the decomposition of the broth, and make it turn sour 
sooner than it otherwise would. The clove of garlic is 
a matter of taste and custom. 

A pound of meat to a quart of water is a fair allow- 
ance for good broth. Large bones should be broken in 
pieces. The time of boiling will vary from three to Qve 
hours. When done, the broth should be of a bright, 
clear, golden light brown, aad perfectly limpid. 

To serve it : slices or bits of crust are put into a 
soup-tureen, and over them the broth is ladled, straining 
it through a cullender. The bread is left to soak in the 



138 BBOTHS AKD SOUF& 

first few ladlefuls, and then the tureen filled with the 
quantity required. The broth is even better next day ; 
it is mellower, and the fat can have been removed. 

The three grand points to attend to, to have good 
broth, are : 1st, the choice of good iresh meat ; 2d, gentle 
and equable boiling all the while, instead of getting cold 
at one time and boiling over at another ; and 3d, keeping 
the soup-pot closely covered with the lid. N.B. Let 
the cook fully understand that broth is not good diluted 
with water. 

Consommdy Concentrated Brothy Stocky is obtained by 
boiling down the above witli additions of meat; but 
when it is known that Strong Broth will be wanted, it 
is better to begin it by itself from the beginning, allow- 
ing a larger proportion of meat, and selecting pieces 
with plenty of tendon, to furnish more gelatine. For 
dark stocks, use shin of beef, and the like ; the addition 
to this of portions of hare, pheasant, or partridge, will 
make a Concentrated Broth of Game. For strong 
White Broths, knuckle of veal must be used ; the addi- 
tion of a fowl cut into joints will make Consomme of 
Fowls. Stock Broths are made for two purposes: to 
supply sauce and gravies to other meats, and to be taken 
by themselves as restoratives. In both cases they should 
be strained, and their fat taken off^ when cold. For the 
former purpose they may be more highly seasoned than 
for the latter, which requires them to be delicate in 
flavour, though by no means insipid. Care is required 
to prevent consommfe from burning or sticking to the 
side of the pot, which would inevitably spoil both flavour

and colour. Sufficient savouriness is obtained by tho 
bouquet, onions, pepper and salt, especiallj when the 
broth of the pot an feu is used to make the concentrated 
broth. A few slices of ham, or a ham-bone, are some* 
times used in making consomm6 ; but smoked ham is apt 
to communicate too much of its peculiar flavour. For 
invalids, ham is best omitted, as having a tendency to 
produce heartburn. 

Broth in an Hour. Cut up a pound of lean beef into 
small pieces ; put it into a stew-pan witli chopped onions 
and carrots, a few thin slices of bacon, and half a tumbler 
of water. Let them simmer and stew for a quarter of 
an hour, till they begin to stick to the bottom of the 
stew-pan. Then add a quart of boiling water, with a pinch 
of salt ; boil three-quarters of an hour ; strain and serve. 

Beef'Tea. It is difficult to make this most useful 
restorative well in an ordinary saucepan, and over an 
ordinary kitchen-fire. Keep for the purpose an earthen 
pot (with a close-fitting lid), that will stand the fire. 
Fill this one-quarter full of the best lean beef cut into 
small pieces; all &t must be removed, but sinew and 
tendon may remain. Season with a little salt and a few 
whole peppercorns. Fill nearly to the top with cold 
water, and set it on the hot plate of a cooking-stove, io 
simmer gently several hours. Take off any scum, and 
afterwards any fat that may rise. Let the beef remain 
in the pot tmtil the whole brewing of beef-tea is used. 
Stir well with a spoon before serving a portion; the 
clearest broth is not the most nutritious. For want of 
a hot iron plate, beef-tea may be made in a very slow 



140 BB0TH8 AKD 80UFS. 

oven ; but in that case it will be as well to lute down 
the lid of the pot with paste. 

Beef-tea is best made fresh and fresh, in small quan- 
tities, as wanted ; the addition of herbs and Tegetables 
must depend on the state of the patient*s stomach. The 
beef left after the tea is drawn off will make capital 
potted beef. 

Chicken BrotL Cat up a lean fowl into joints ; an 
old one makes better broth than a young one, onlj it 
takes more than twice the time to cook. Put it in a 
well-closed saucepan, with a beef or veal bone, onions, 
carrots, a sprig of parsley, a pinch of salt, and plenty of 
water. Skim as soon as it boils up, and simmer gently 
afterwards. An old fowl will take five or six hours to 
yield all its goodness to the broth. 

Rabbit Broth may be made as above, and is done 
more quickly. It is light, and affords a pleasant change 
when an invalid is tired of the taste of chicken. 

Vecd Broilij Wliite. Put a pound of the lean parts 
of veal, with an equal quantity of bones and cartilage, 
into a covered saucepan, with two quarts of cold water, 
a little salt, an onion, and the heart of a lettuce pulled to 
pieces. Boil up, skim, and reduce. 

Vecd Brothy Brown. Partially fry on both sides, 
in butter, a good slice of fillet of veal ; do the same to 
a slice of lean bacon and a slice of lean beef. When 
nicely browned, throw them into a saucepan of boiling 
water with onions, carrots, the rind of half a lemon, 
pepper and salt, and then let it simmer gently. For 
invalids, the bacon and the beef may be omitted*

The aboye maj be oonyerted into nice VecU Scupy 
by taking out the meat when done, cutting it into dice, 
and then returning it to the soup together with some 
thickening made by browning flour in the butter which 
fried the meat, and diluting it gradually with a little of 
the broth, giving the whole a final boil up. The onions 
will have fidlen to pieces, and may remain. The carrots 
may be chopped fine and added to the soup. 

Broths in general may be made more supporting 
and nutritious by the addition of macaroni, vermicelli, 
Italian pastes, or rice. Tliese are best boiled separately 
in a little of the broth tUl tender. In warming up such 
broth a second time, care must be taken that nothing 
sticks to the bottom. 

Mutton Broth. Cut two pounds of scrag of mutton 
into slices ; put them on with three quarts of cold water, 
two table-spoonfuls of pearl barley, and a little salt. 
Let boil till the meat is done to rags. Strain out the 
meat and bones, and the residue of the barley, and when 
cold remove the fat. 

Onion, celery, and turnip, as also a sprig of parsley 
or thyme, may be added to the broth if the patient's 
stomach is able to bear them. 

Scotch Broose. " Will you take a few broth ?" is an 
old expression, proving that broth has its plural, even if 
it be not a noun of multitude. Take a neck of mutton 
with the fat raised from oiF the best end. Cut off the 
scrag end, and divide it into several pieces to make the 
broth. Let it boil gently a couple of hours, skimming 
well. Then add sliced carrots, onions, turnips, celery.

a sprig of parsley, pepper and salt, a teacupfol of split 
peas, and six table-spoonfuls of pearl-barley, both pre- 
viously steeped in tepid water. 

Cut the best end of the neck into mutton-chops, 
oxactly as if for frying ; put them in soon after the 
vegetables, and let the whole simmer together until all 
is tender. A second skimming will be required after 
the addition of tlie fresh meat and vegetables. In 
serving, there should be a mutton-chop for each person's 
plate, to be accompanied by the vegetables, barley, and 
broose. 

In country places where pearl-barley is not to be 
had, oatmeal, groats, or rice may be substituted for it 

Scottish Hotch^Potclu [From Meg Dod£ Cookery^ 
rich in Scotch national dishes.] Make the stock of sweet 
fresh lamb or mutton. Grate the zest (outer rind) of 
two or three large young carrots ; slice down as many 
more. Slice down also sweet young turnips, young 
onions, lettuce, and parsley. Have a full quart of these 
things when finally shred, another of green pease and 
sprigs of cauliflower. Put in the vegetables, witiiholding 
half the pease till near the end of the process. Cut 
down two or three pounds of ribs of lamb into small 
steaks, trimming off superfluous fat, and put them to the 
stock Boil well, and skim carefully ; add the remaining 
pease, white pepper, and salt ; and when thick enough, 
serve the cutlets in the tureen witli the hotch-potcL 

Ohs. The excellence of this favourite dish depends 
mainly on the meat, whether lamb or mutton, being 
perfectly fresh, and the vegetables being all young, full

of sweet juices, and boiled till of good consistence. Tlie 
sweet white tnmip is best for hotch-potch^ or the small, 
round, smooth-grained, yellow kind peculiar to Scot- 
land, which is almost equal to [it is better than] th^ 
genuine Navet of France. Mutton-chops make excellent 
hotch-potch without lamb-steaks. Parsley shred, white 
cabbage, asparagus-points, or cauliflower, may be added 
to the other vegetables or not, at pleasure. Tlie meat 
may be kept whole, and served separately. 

Of this receipt, when it first ap|)eared in our work, 
a great poet, and no contemptible gastronome, wrote, 
^' Eve might have prepared it for Adam in paradise.'* 
There are, however, many varieties of Scottish hotch- 
potch; we give what wo consider the best and most 
naiionaL 

Cock-^t-leekie* [^Idem.'] Boil fi-om four to six 
poimds of good shin-beef, well broken, till the liquor is 
very good. Strain it, and put it to a capon or large 
fowl, trussed as for boiling ; and, when it boils, half the 
quantity of blanched leeks intended to be used, well 
cleaned, and cut in inch-lengths, or longer. Skim this 
carefully. In a half-hour, add the remaining part of the 
leeks, and a seasoning of pepper and salt The soup 
must be very thick of leeks, and the first part of them 
must be boiled down into the soup till it becomes a 
lubricous compound. Sometimes the capon is served in 
the tureen with the soup. 

This makes good Icek-soup without a fowl. 
Obs. Some people thicken cock-a-leekie with the 
flour of oatmeal. Those who dislike so much of the

leeks [but they are medicinal, says the Doctor, on ao* 
count of their mucilage] may substitute Oerman greens^ 
or spinage, for one-half of them ; and we (Meg Dods) 
consider this an improvement, greens especially, if ten- 
der and long-boiled, and not too finely shred. Beject 
the coarse green of the leeks. 

Prunes and raisins used to be put into this soup* 
The practice is nearly obsolete. 

Chemut Soup, Have ready some good broth or 
consomm^ ; that of game or fowl is best. 

Peel the brown skin firom a quantity of raw chesnuts ; 
boil them a minute or two in water, to make the under- 
skin come away easily. Pound them in a mortar ; boil 
them in water till tender enough to crush them through 
a cullender with a spoon ; throw them into the broth ; 
boil up again, and pour into a tureen with a few crusts 
or dice of toasted bread, and a sliffJu sprinkling of sugar 
at the bottom. 

Shm-^f'Beef Soup, Into a large boiler of cold water 
put eight or nine pounds of the hind legs of beef, cut 
into convenient-sized pieces, six large carrots, ten onions^ 
and three heads of celery, all sliced, a bunch of sweet 
herbs, two whole anchovies, a little bit of ham, quite 
lean, from the bone (a small portion of ham-bone which 
is tolerably dose cut will answer exceedingly well), and 
some pounded cloves and whole pepper. All these are 
to simmer gently over a slow fire for at least twenty-four 
hours (six-and-thiriy is better), and are then to be 
strained into a pan and left to cool till the next morning, 
when the fat may be cleared ofi; A few small carrots

and batton onions should be boiled separately in a por- 
tion of this liquor, and added with it when the soup is 
served* When the beef is about enough and not too 
mnch done, the nicest pieces of gristle and tender meat 
should be picked out, cut into dice, and added to the 
soup before serving it. 

Flemish Soup. Put two ounces of butter into a stew- 
pan, with a sufficiency of stock or good broth that has 
been well skimmed. Into this slice six onions and three 
heads of celery cut into small pieces. Set it over a slow 
fire, to boil gently for one hour. At the same time peel 
and quarter a dozen middle-sized potatoes, and put them 
on in a separate saucepan to boil. This is done because 
potatoes ought not to be cooked in any soup, hash, or 
made dish of which they are to form part, as the water 
that comes from them contains a principle that disagrees 
with many stomachs. When the quartered potatoes are 
done enough, drain them a minute or two, and add them 
to the sliced onions and celery. Season with a little 
pepper and salt When the potatoes are quite dissolved, 
rub the whole through an iron-wire sieve ; add a pint of 
cream, and give it a boil. A little macaroni broken into 
short lengths, boiled tender in milk, and thrown into the 
soup just before going to table, is a great improvement 

Cabbage Soup. Wash thoroughly, and shred very 
fine (as for making pickled cabbage), the hearts of one 
or two summer cabbages, or of a very delioate Savoy, 
according to size. Slice and mince some carrot, turnip, 
and two or three leeks, all ver}'- fine, and mix weU these 
chopped vegetables together in a salad-bowL

Have ready a good broth : pork or beef boQings will 
do, when not too salt ; but French cooks prefer a broth 
or bouillon made of a variety of meats boiled together : 
for instance, a piece of lean beef, a knuckle of veal, a 
amall piece of salt pork, and a bit of the neck or shoulder 
of mutton. 

These meats need not be cooked so much as to render 
ihem uneatable, either cold or warmed up in a stew,, or 
even served hot at the same dinner at which the soup 
appears. For these purposes thej are invariably used 
in France, instead of being thrown out to the dogs, as 
broth-meat too frequently is in England. 

When the meat is enough done according to your 
judgment, make the broth boil galloping, and then throw 
in your bowlful of well-drained shred and chopped vege- 
tables. Let ihem boil on, without the lid, till the cabbage^ 
&C., are quite tender ^ but not cooked to a mash. 

While the vegetables are boiling, slice and chop one 
or two large onions (if more convenient, they may be 
prepared beforehand, and set by, cold, till wanted). Fry 
them in butter to a rich brown. Add them to the soup, 
and mix them up witli it 

Cahbage Soupy meager^ for abstinence-days, is made 
in the same way as above, using water instead of broth, 
and often adding to the cabbage a large handful of 
chopped sorrel — an excellent antiscorbutic and purifier 
of the blood. A larger quantity of fried onions is used^ 
and at the time of adding them to the soup a small 
basinful of grated crumb of bread is also incorporated 
with it, to make it more nourishing.

Mock'Turtle Soup. Although Sheep's-Head Broth, 
Ox -Cheek Soup, and Soup made firom Calf's -Head 
boilings, are dishes veiy generally eaten ; nevertheless, 
many persons, who will not allow that they are over- 
fiustidioos, object to make use of the liquor obtained 
firom the inside as well as the outside of an animal's 
head, however carefully it may be washed. The follow- 
ing plan meets their objection with the slightest possible 
loss of nutritive matter. 

Take half a cairs head, properly scalded and pre- 
pared, with the skin on. Take out the brains, and boil 
them separately in salt and water. Take out the bones 
of ihe^ and wash the head in cold spring-water. 
Put it on the fire in a large boiler or soup-kettle, in 
which it can be well covered with cold water. Throw in 
a handful of salt Skim imtil it boils, and there remains 
no more scum to remove. Let it boil galloping a 
quarter of an hour or twenfy minutes ; then take it out ; 
throw away this first water, and put the head on the 
fire again in firesh hot water, in which it may boil until 
enough, but not too much, done. Any impurities which 
can reasonably excite dislike will have been removed by 
the first water and its scum. 

One half of the meat on the head will suffice for the 
soup for a small pariy ; the remainder may be used for 
any other pmrpose — to be eaten, for instance, plain-boiled, 
with the brains as sauce. Set aside your soup-meat to 
cool. When cold, cut it up into dice, including with it 
a fair proportion of the tongue. 

To the calfVhead boilings add a knuckle of veal cut 



148 BBOTHS Aim SOUPS. 

np into several pieces, and a small piece of shin of beef, 
two carrots sliced, and two large onions. Let it boil till 
the meat is done to rags, adding hot water from time to 
time, when required, to maintain the quantiiy wanted. 

Half an hour before it is quite cooked, add a burnt 
onion, a sprig of parsley, two bay-leaves, a stick of 
celery with some of the green leaf, a slice of lemon-peel, 
a good bunch of thyme^ knotted marjoram^ and ^oeet basil 
[some cooks even hold that sweet basil is the secret of 
first-rate mock-turtle], with salt, a few cloves, common 
and cayenne pepper to your taste. When done, strain 
the whole through a large-holed cullender, and set your 
stock aside in a jar to cool, which will enable you to 
remove the fat and leave the sediment at the bottom. 

To make the thickening : Put a quarter of a pound 
of butter in a stew-pan. When quite hot, stir in 
gradually half a pound of flour, and mix with it some of 
your stock, keeping it quite smooth and fi:ee firom knots. 
Should knots be formed, they must be strained away. 
Then add it to your stock, continually stirring, and 
letting it boil well together. When thoroughly amal- 
gamated, throw in your forcemeat balls, and adding 
the juice of a lemon and two glasses of madeira or 
generous white wine. Then put in your bits of soup- 
meat. 

The forcemeat balls are made with veal stuffing, 
about the size of marbles, and baked brown in a smart 
oven. For egg-balls, when liked, pound smooth several 
hard egg-yolks, with one raw yolk and a dust of flour, 
to the consistency that will allow you to roll them into 



BBOTHS AND SOUPS. 149 

marbles. Season with cayenne and salt Throw them 
into boiling water, and let them cook a couple of minutes. 

The essential points for good Mock-Turtle Soup are : 
first, a rich, smooth stock, delicately yet highly flavoured ; 
secondly, a savouiy thickening, creamy and of a good 
colour, witiiout the least taste of burning; thirdly, a 
fair proportion of tempting morsels of gelatinous calPs 
head, with a judicious mixture of fat and lean ; fourthly, 
the piquant aroma arising from the herbs, the wine, the 
lemon-peel and juice, and the spices used. 

The forcemeat and egg balls are only secondary 
items, by no means indispensable, and often omitted. 
Their absence does not spoil good mock -turtle, while 
their presence would not make bad mock-turtle good. 

Gravy Soup. Have three or four pounds of the 
fleshy part of a shin of beef cut across in slices, sawing 
the bone quite through. Tou may take out the marrow ; 
it win help to make The Doctor's Pudding, Ac. With 
the meat and bones make a good stock, flavouring with 
the vegetables and herbs usual for brown soups. 

Suppose you have left a quantity of roast -beef or 
veal gravy. Put this with the fat into a stew-pan ; 
when hot, brown in it chopped onions and flour for a 
thickening; season; work it well into your stock; strain, 
boil up, and serve. 

Hare Soup. Skin a large hare, saving the blood 
when you empty it. Wipe it well, but do not wash it. 
Cut it up into joints, and put them with the blood into 
an earthen vessel that will hold six or seven pints. Add 
two pounds of lean beef cut in pieces, two large onions 



150 BROTHS AND SOUP& 

quartered, a bunch of sweet herbs, whole pepper, maoe, 
and a few doves. Nearly fill the vessel with boiling 
water, tie its top down close with a bladder, and set it 
to cook in a boiler of water for three or four hours. 
Pour off the soup, thicken it with a little flour and 
butter, stirring jin at the same time a table-spoonfol of 
any or several of the following sauces— viz. essence of 
anchovy, soy, Worcestershire, Beading, or Harvey^s 
sauce, mushroom or walnut ketchup, or oiher approved 
zest Make quite hot, and send to table with forcemeat 
balls and the best parts of the meat of the hare thrown 
into it. 

Pease Soup Purde — Purie de Pais, In the French 
kitchen purSe sometimes simply denotes Pease Soup; 
more commonly it is applied to other seeds, vegetables, 
roots, and fruits, reduced by tlie same means to the same 
consistency, affixing to each jmrde the name of the sub- 
stance of which it is made : as puree of lentik, purde of 
potatoes, of sorrel, carrots, onions, tomatoes, pumpkins, 
and so on. We therefore adopt the word purde as being 
precise, useful, and significative. 

Purees are employed for two purposes — as ingre- 
dients in soups, and as sauces for solid meats ; in both 
ways they render considerable service. As sauces, they 
are usually spread in a tliick layer at the bottom of the 
dish on which the article to be served is placed. Thus 
we have boiled or fried sausages on a pur^ of potatoes 
— resembling our mashed potatoes, only not quite so dry; 
fricandeau of veal on a pur& of sorrel ; mutton-chops on 
a pur& of tomatoes; lamb-chops on a pur4e of cucumbers. 



JBBOTHS AND 80UB8. " 151 

Generally considered, purees are preferable as arti- 
cles of diet to the seeds or vegetables which form their 
basis, because thej retain all the nutritive elements, 
labile the skin, rind, or cortical envelope — ^which passes 
undigested through almost every human stomach — is 
removed. Pur^s may be freely given to invalids, the 
raw materials of which can be eaten with impunity only 
by robust individuals in the habit of daily taking strong 
exercise: familiar instances are seen in apples, celery, 
cucumbers. 

Pease Soup may be made with either blue or white 
dried pease, and those either whole or split. The Prus- 
sian-blue races are excellent for the purpose — so likewise 
^re many of the whites. There is an uncertainty about 
pease turning out ^^ good boilers ;" something may de- 
pend on the soil on which they are grown, more on the 
water in which they are boiled. 

Soak the peas all night in soft water. Filtered rain* 
water is the best, as it also is for boiling them. Put 
ihem on with the water cold, and without salt The time 
of boiling to make them tender will depend on their 
quality. Ton may boil some pease in some waters all 
day long, and they will still remain hard and indissolu- 
ble. When quite tender and falling to pieces, squeeze 
ihem with the back of a wooden spoon through a large- 
holed cullender into a bowL The bowl will contain the 
true pur^ of the pease ; the skins and hard bits will 
remain in the cullender. 

Pease Soup should be good of the stock, as well as 
.good of the pease. The Doctor has heard water-made 



152 BROTHS AND SOUPS. 

pease soup contemphiously spoken of as ^^ Pea Broifa." 
It is usual to make pease soup with the boilings of salt 
meat— of a leg of pork or a piece of corned meat. Such 
soup may suit the stomachs of agricultural labourers, or 
their equally robust employers ; but the Doctor advises 
his readers to beware of it The boilings of meat which 
has been long in salt acquire from it certain pungent and 
acrid qualities which are very apt to bring on heartburn, 
indigestion, or diarrhoea in stomachs that have not become 
^^ tolerant" of that class of food. On shipboard, and in 
other situations, there is sometimes no choice ; but where 
there is a choice, the invalid will make it A soldier in 
the French army, who went through the Crimean cam- 
paign, told the Doctor that he attributed the diarrhoea 
which at one time invalided the troops to the hacoru He 
abstained from the bacon, and escaped. 

Some cooks try to avert the evil by using half salt 
boilings and half fresh broth or water ; but it is a half- 
measure which effects but little good: the unpleasant 
and unwholesome twang always remains ; and tjie worst 
of it is, that it does not always offend the palate at the 
time, but causes the stomach to suffer afterwards. It is 
wiser to reject salt boilings altogether, unless of meafc 
that has been salted two or three days only at most 
Ham, tongue, and other smoked-meat boilings are only 
fit to season pig-wash. 

Any fresh-meat boiUngs may be used for pease soup, 
but the flavour of pork is the old-established rule. Take, 
therefore, a couple of hocks of pork, with their feet, 
which have not been salted more than two or three days. 



BROTHS AND SOUPS. 153 

Wash ihem well before pnitmg them on in your boiler 
in cold water. When they boil and have been skimmed, 
add two split carrots, two sliced turnips, three or fonr 
siloed onions, a parsnip, and two good heads of celery, 
"with a little of the green leaf remaining. When tlie 
flesh of the feet will come away from the bones, take 
them oat, and cut them into small pieces, to add to the 
soup jost before serving. When the hocks are well 
done, they can be taken out, and either have their meat 
applied to the same purpose if liked, or be set aside, to 
be eaten cold at breakfast or lunch. 

When the vegetables are quite tender^ take them out, 
chop them fine, and return them to the soup; or you 
may squeeze them into it, in the shape of a pur€e, 
through a cullender. Add the purfo of pease to thicken 
the soup to the consistency liked ; throw in the meat of 
the feet, and what you like of the hock ; season with 
pepper and cayenne to taste ; add salt, if needed, and 
serve hot. Do not let any of your guests mutter in your 
ear: 

** The King of the South, 
He burnt his mouth 

With eating of cold peaae porridge." 

The colour of pease soup made of blue pease may be 
heightened and improved by the addition of a pur^ of 
spinach, which, however, will slightly modify the flavour. 
A better way of effecting the same object is that to be 
shortly given in Green-Pease Soup without Green Pease. 
Pease Soup should have a decided flavour of celery; 
when the plant is not to be had, the crushed seed will

give it. Bread sliced thin, toasted, and cat into dice, 
should be passed round together with pease soup. The 
bouquet and the addition of wine have not been men- 
tioned, but are left to individual taste, because it is 
not desirable to make all soups taste alike — which is t 

an occasional fault with the soups and made dishes of 
pastry-cook shops: thej are very nice, but sometimes 
very monotonous, so that by shutting your eyes you could 
not teU one thing from another. Dried mint in powder 
is orthodox seasoning to a plate of pease soup. 

Pease soup is fattening, light, and, with the pork re- 
turned to it, substantial,— Ksomprising meat and drink at 
once. It is then elevated to the important dass specified 
by the Cleikum Club as " Soup and Stew, or Mouthful 
Soups — a division which we think was wanted in books

Soup on a winter^s day supplies a solid fund of heat 
and strength.

Green-Peaae Soup. Put a quarter of a pound of 
butter at the bottom of a large stew-pan. When hot, 
throw into it three pints of young green peas, two 
cabbage-lettuces shred fine, two cucumbers peeled and 
sliced, and two large onions sliced with their green. When 
nearly fried enough, stir in smoothly a dessert-spoonftd 
of flour. Pour in gradually throe quarts of good veal 
broth. If you have a ham-bone, put it in ; if not, two

potatoes mashed. Let all simmer a couple of hom^s, 
Bldmmmg off any fet which may rise, and taking care 
the vegetables do not stidc to the bottom. Before serv- 
ing, remove the ham-bone, and throw in a cupful of 
boiled green peas, with the Uquor they were cooked in. 
You may also add a few small dice of either fried or 
toasted bread. 

Green-Pease Saup^ without green peasy for winter

may even be grown in any warm room ; but the quicker 
they are made to vegetate, the better. When three or 
four inches high and well greened, cut them just above 
the ground. Wash, drain, and chop them fine, as you 
would pardey for sauce. 

Prepare a good dried-pease soup, making the stock

almonds. Add all these to a pint of cream, and boil 
them with the fresh-cut rind of the other half lemon and 
a blade of mace reduced to very fine powder. Stir in

almonds, a couple of hard egg-yolks, and some crumb 
of bread soaked in the broth. While pounding, gradually 
moisten with broth, and work till all is smooth enough 
to press through a strainer. 

Add this pur^ to the chicken broth, stirring in at 
the same time a pint or more of cream, and seasoning 
lightly with pepper and salt This operation is best per- 
formed in a hot-water bath, as the soup is liable to curdle* 



BBOTHS AKD SOUPS. 15^ 

Before pouring the soup into the tureen, toasted or 
filed bread dice may be laid at the bottom ; but the soup 
is kept whiter by adding nothing more darkly coloured 
than rice or yermioelli ready-cooked in the broth. 

This soup may be made still more rich and regal by 
boiling the fowls in broth instead of water. 

Fancy Soup. Slice a few small onions into a stew-- 

pan, with two or three carrots, a little bit of ham, and a. 

good piece of real. Stew these together over a good fire, 

and when the veal begins to brown nicely, fill up with 

good hot broth, and let them simmer till the veal is- 

thoroughly cooked, and has conmiunicated all its good* 

ness to the soup. Use this, strained, to make your stock. 

Soak, at the bottom of your soup-tureen, tlie crusts. 

of a couple of French rolls in this liquor. Then pound 

in a mortar a couple of hard egg-yolks, and six blanched 

almonds; when pounded smooth, stir them into your 

soup till it is of the consistency of a rather thin pur&}. 

If too thick, you will have to pass it through a strainer. 

Heat up cautiously, to avoid curdling, and pour the ptu:6e- 

over the soaked roll-crusts. 

Ghrbures form a class of pottages of which Ude says, 
'* This soup is never seen in this country ; it requires a 
very deep and a very large dish." An earthen one is. 
usual, but a silver one will do. Grarbures are thick in 
consistency, and contain Parmesan or Gruy^re cheese, 
brown bread (properly rye), cabbage, bacon, and other 
ingredients. They are held in great esteem in the 
Southern provinces of France. As an example, for 
Cabbage Garbure^ take hearted cabbages, bind them 



160 BROTHS AND 80UPS. 

round with tape ; put them into a stew-pan, with slices of 
bacon at the bottom ; add carrots and onions^ season with 
cloves, and fill up with any good broth you have. 

When the cabbages are done enough, take them up, 
untie them, and cut them in slices, which put at the 
bottom of a deep, wide dish, placing thin slices of brown 
bread between each layer of cabbage. Dust the layers 
of cabbage with pepper, and pour a little of the broth in 
which they were cooked over all. Set the dish in a slow 
oven for a few minutes, or sprinkle crumbs on the top, 
and brown it imder a salamander. The rest of the broth 
is served separate firom the pottage. 

A garbure is made with solid-hearted lettuces in 
exactly the same way as for cabbages ; with gwrnmant^ 
a kind of gourd ; with chesnuts, onions, leeks, and the 
a whole list of kitchen vegetables ; it is also enriched, 
according to place and circumstance, with cheese, 
partridges, sausages, ham, the stewed legs of knd or 
water fowl, pigeons, &c. A good garbure should bear 
unmistakable marks of having been baked as well as 
boiled. ^^ What sticks to the bottom of the dish is most 
tasiy and palatable." 

NouUlea Soup, Nouilles are a sort of home-made 
imitation of vermicelli and macaroni paste, produced 
by mixing flour, eggs, pepper, salt, and grated nutmeg 
into a very firm paste. Soil it out very thin, and cut 
into long, narrow strips, which must be dusted with flour 
to prevent their sticking together. Throw these into your 
boiling stock broth or consomme, and let them cook 
briskly for twenty minutes. 



BBOTHS AND SOUPS. 161 

Any vegetable pnr^, at disoretion, may be added, if 
it be wished to give a little thickness to the soup. 

Ox'taU Soup, One large or two small tails will make 
soup for half a dozen persons. Knot quite fresh, the soup 
will be milky and perhaps unsavomy. Cut them into 
joints, and stew them slowly for three or four hours, 
nntil the meat comes 'easily from the bones, with a 
sufficiency of water, carrots, onions, pepper, and salt, 
taking care not to let the peculiar flavour of the ox-tail 
be overpowered by any^other. 

'V\^en done, take out the pieces of tail whole, and 
set them aside. Thicken the stew with flour and fried 
onion ; diluting it afterwards with good consomme. 
Strain, add the ox-tail, boil up, and serve. 

MuUigatavmy Soup, Slice and peel twelve good- 
sized onions; fry them in butter, with a full table- 
spoonful of curry-powder. Put them into a stew-pan 
with two quarts of good veal stock and a small quantity 
of mace, thickening with a little flour. Stew for an hour, 
and pass it through a sieve. Knot quite thick enough, 
add a little more flour and butter. Cut up a cold 
chicken into small pieces, and put it into the soup with 
a teacupfril of cream. Give a final boil up, and serve. 

Giblet Soup, Swan giblets are the best, then Groose, 
then Turkey, then Duck and Fowl. For water-birds, 
the pinion should be chopped in two across; the feet 
scalded, removing the outer skin and the claws. For 
all, cut the neck into short pieces ; split the head, re- 
moving the beak and eyes ; divide the livers into two, 
and the gizzards (well cleaned, and peeled of the hard, 

M 



162 BROTHS AND SOUPS. 

white skin) into foor pieces. Stew these tender (the 
gizzards will take longer than the rest), and then proceed 
exactly as with ox-tail. If yon make jomr stock of the 
hones or remains of ponltrj, all the better. Tou may 
season rather highly with herbs and spice, as there is no 
fear of overpowering the giblet flavour. 

Julienne Soup. There is a class of soups, useful, 
light, agreeable, and susceptible of great apparent 
variety, but which are simply well-flavoured broth or 
consomm^, with the addition Cither of vegetables, as 
julienne soup, or of preparations of flour and starch in 
various forms, as vermicelli, tapioca, sago, and the like. 

For julienne, cut into very fine, narrow strips, 
carrots, turnips, parsnips, cabbage, celery, leeks, pota- 
toes, onions, each in equal quantity. Chop some lettuce, 
chervil, and sorrel. Tou may add (chopped small, or in 
long, narrow strips) the green tops of asparagus, green 
kidney beans, green peas (whole) ; in short, whatever 
vegetables are in season. 

Mix these, and put them all together in a stew-pan 
with a good lump of butter and a little sugar and salt. 
Cover them close, and let them stew a few minutes; 
then add your broth, and boil till all the vegetables are 
thoroughly done. It is not usual to put bread, either in 
crusts or toasted dice, into julienne soup. Machines or 
choppers are sold for cutting the vegetables for this 
wholesome dish; they can also be purchased preserved 
dry. N.B. When a soup, of whatever kind, strikes you 
as particularly agreeable to the palate, it is often owing 
to the unsuspected presence of a very slight dust of sugar. 



BROTHS AND SOUPS. 163 

Spring Soup. With a quart of green peas, take a 
good quantity of lettaoe, purslane, sorrel, chervil, and 
yoimg oracfae leaves. Parsley, spinach, and chives, or 
spruig onions, may be added if liked. Put them in a 
close-covered stew-pan, with a lump of fresh butter, 
pepper and salt, and a little water or broth. Stew them 
gently over a slow fire untQ enough. Squeeze them 
through a cullender, so as to obtain a smooth pur4e. 
Dilute that to the thickness you like, either with water 
or with broth. Throw in some rice that has been previ- 
ously boiled (or, instead of that, a few grated bread- 
crumbs) ; season to taste, and let it simmer another 
qoarter of an hour. Before serving, add a thickening 
made with two or three yolks of e^. 

Potage a la Jardinikre — Grardener^s Soup. Take 
potatoes, turnips, carrots, celery, and leeks in sufficient 
quantity; cut them in pieces more or less big. Put 
them in a stew-pan on a gentle fire, and scald them a 
few minutes in boiling water. Complete their c6oking 
with broth or soup. When nearly done, throw in some 
green peas, asparagus-tops, purslane-leaves, or other 
tender vegetables, as time and place allow. 

Pumpkin Soup. Cut the half or the quarter of a 
pumpkin into slices, according to size ; peel off the rind 
and remove the seeds ; cut them in pieces as big as a 
walnut, and set them on the fire covered with boiling 
water. When the pumpkin is completely reduced to a 
marmalade or pulp, put to it two or three ounces of 
butter and a little salt Let it boil another turn or two. 

Boil separately a quart of milk ; flavour it with a 



164 BBOTHS AND SOUPS. 

little sugar or salt, or botli, and stir it into the pumpkin 
pur^a Put some minced bread at the bottom of jour 
tureen, and pour over it the mixture of pumpkin and 
milk. 

Onion Soup. Cut a dozen middle-sized onions into 
shreds. Brown them over the fire in a stew-pan, with a 
good lump of butter, turning them with your slioe till 
thej are cooked tender and sufficiently browned. Add a 
spoonful of flour, and let it take a nice colour. Dilute 
with boiling broth gradually, season with salt and 
peppercorns, and ^ve it a boiL Then add some bread, 
either grated or sliced ; simmer for a while, and serve. 

By substituting water for broth, you have an Onion 
Soup Maiffre. You may get rid of the onions, before add- 
ing the bread, by passing the soup through a cullender ; 
the Doctor advises to let them remain, as being both 
nutritive and medicinal. Beplacing the water by mUk, 
you get an Onion and Milk Soup Maigre. N.B. In these 
soups in which bread is laid at the bottom of the soup- 
tureen or added to the broth, care must be taken (as 
directed for bread sauce) not to put too much bread in 
proportion to the quantity of soup. 

Rice and Onion Soup. Proceed exactly as before; 
only, instead of bread, add some ready-cooked rice ; boil 
up and serve. This soup may also be made meagre, 
and is excellent either way. 

Tapioca Soup* Tapioca lends itself to a variety of 
usages, by simple washing and soaking and boiling 
slowly in water set on cold. The separate grains should 
not lose their form. It is then ready either for con-

version into jeUies, creams, and puddings, by combination 
with wine, milk, eggs, &c., or for giving substance to 
soups. As in this state it will take any flavour, it is 
convenient for supplying a basin of good soup, or an 
agreeable sweet dish, in oaae of hurry or emergency. 
But there is nothing to prevent tapioca for soup being 
boiled in stock-broth^ or tapioca for puddings being 
boiled in milk. 

Put as much ready-boiled tapioca into your stock as 
will bring it to the consistency of good pease soup. 
There ought never to be. a mere sediment of tapioca at 
the bottom of your tureen, covered and drowned by an 
ocean of broth. .The tapioca should pervade the soup. 
Flavour with whatever you like. The ordinary vege- 
tables are most commonly employed. 
Saffo Soup. Exactly as above* 
Arrowroot Soup, Any soup or broth, particularly 
white soups, may be thickened with arrowroot Put a 
small quantity in a basin, add some of the broth drop by 
drop, working with the back of a spoon, till it is of the 
consistency of thick mustard. Stir this into the soup, 
and boil up well afterwards. 

Bice AfUky Savoury. Rice — that curious product of 
nature, to which may be literally applied the expression 
of ^^ casting your bread upon the waters, and finding it 
afler many days," — ^rice, amphibious in its origin, allies 
itself with equally harmonious effects to either of the 
grand divisions of alimentary materials — ^to savouries or 
sweets, to meat, fish, fruit, or vegetables. Rice is the 
Proteus of the kitchen, assuming every form, thick or 



166 BBOTHS AND SOUPS. 

thin, fat or lean, solid or liquid. As a crust, it forms 
the most honourable mausoleum in which to entomb a 
fricassee of fowl ; it gives substance to soup, it combines 
with every sort of pur^ ; it supplies an indispensable 
check to the excitements of cuny ; it surrounds the 
capon with an elegant garnish, imbibing a great part of 
his succulence. At the third course it helps us to creams 
and puddings ; at dessert, reduced to flour, it figures in 
cakes. It adopts every disguise in order to please, and 
almost always succeeds in pleasing. Rice is welcomed 
with approbation by every judicious and impartial eater. 
Rice-milk pure is better suited to the nursery than for 
consumption by adults. Take, therefore, half milk and 
half veal or chicken broth. Put them on the fire in a 
saucepan with a sufficiency of rice that has been steeped 
all night in soft water. Add one or two small white 
onions chopped very fine, a little salt, and a small pinch 
of white pepper, if liked. Boil, stirring frequently, to 
prevent the milk from burning and the rice from sticking^ 
to the bottom, until the rice is quite tender, without being 
dissolved. The object of the onion and salt is to relieve 
the insipidiiy of the milk, rather than to give a decided 
flavour. 

Rice Milky Sweet. Boil previously steeped rice, as 
before, in half milk and half water, flavouring with a 
small pinch of salt, sufficient sugar, the rind of half a 
lemon or half an orange, and either cinnamon, mace, or 
nutmeg, as preferred. When done, take it off the fire. 

Beat up (not froth) in a basin one or two eggs, gra- 
dually adding a little of the warm milk. When this 



BROTHS Am) SOUPS. 167 

mixture is nicely blended, combine it carefnllj with the 
rice-milk in the saucepan, which must not boil afterwards. 
Half a glass of white wine, or a dessert-spoonful of 
brandy, are legitimate additions to Bice Milk, Sweet. 
Both the above preparations may be varied by using 
ground rice instead of whole. 

Apph Soup (German). Peel fresh apples, cut out 
their cores, and boil them thoroughly with grated crumb 
of bread, lemon-peel and lemon-juice, cinnamon and 
cardamum, or other aromatic seeds. When cooked to a 
pulp, mb them through a sieve. Add white wine, and 
sweeten to your taste. Serve with toasted bread. 

Cherry Soup (German). Pluck the cherries from 
their stalks, and boil them enough in water, with cinna- 
mon, lemon-peel, and lemon-juice. Then add wine and 
sugar, and serve it poured over bread cut into dice and 
fried in butter. Tou may also pound a few cherries 
smaD, boil them in water, and pass them through a sieve. 
This soup may likewise be made with dried cherries and 
pearl-barley, boiled several hours in water, passed 
through a sieve, and then served as above. N.B. An 
earthen or metal cullender or strainer is surer to be clean 
and sweet than a horsehair sieve. 

OcU^GrocUs Soup (Grerman). Stir up the groats in 
boiling water with a bit of butter as big as a walnut, 
until they are cooked enough. Pass through a sieve or 
cullender, and add lemon-peel, cinnamon, white wine, 
and sugar. Set it on the fire again to boil. If it is 
wished to have raisins in it, they must be previously 
steeped until they are well swollen. On serving, you 



168 BROTHS AND SOUPS* 

may stir in some oream and three or four yolks of egg, 
with a little toasted bread to swim on the top. 

Wine Soup (German). Take a little water , and mix 
with it lemon-peel chopped very fine, some pounded 
cardamum seeds, pounded sugar, and grated bread made 
of fine rye-flour from which the bran has been thoroughly 
sifi}ed. Stir, and boil until enough, and then add the 
wine to it 

Wine Soupy with an Island of Bread (German). Take 
a good quantity of well-baked rye-bread ; you may mix 
with it a portion of white bread, if you like. Fry it in 
butter, powder it with sugar, and while still warm press 
it together into a heap or mound in the middle of your 
disL Then take two parts of German wine and one of 
water; boil the same with sugar, cinnamon, and carda- 
mum ; and then stir up with it a few yolks of eggs. 
Pour this over the mound of bread, which you can 
now garnish with orange-peel, almonds, or rose-hips. 
You can make this soup in the same way with beer, and 
can also stick currants in the island of bread. 

Rye-Bread Soup (German). Take wine and water 
(the former predominating), grate rye-bread into it, add 
finely chopped lemon-peel and sugar, and boil all well 
together. Then stir in the yolks of two eggs. Instead 
of the water, you may use sweetwort or pale beer, 
flavouring with pounded cardamum. 

Beer Soup^ with Cream (Grerman). To one quart of 
beer add half a pint of sweet cream, a small piece of 
butter, a little sugar, salt, and allspice. Let it boil; 
then further add a spoonful of flour well mixed in a little 



BROTHS AND SOUPS. 169 

cold cream ; boil up again ; and lastly throw in two 
yolks of egg also mixed with a little cream. 

Beer Soup for Supper j or towards the close of a Ball 
(Gl^rman). Put one quart of white beer (i e. not porter, 
nor high-coloured beer), a wine-glass of red wine, eight 
yolks of eggs, a little cinnamon and sugar, and a pinch 
of salt, into a deep saucepan. Stir untU it begins to boil 
up ; then serve hot in cups. 

Vermicelli Soup. Break vermicelli into convenient 
lengths ; wash and steep it in cold soft water. Boil it 
tender separately, in a little of the stock to which it is to 
be added ; a good clear consomm^ is the best. Heat up 
all together, and serve. The same of macaroni and 
other Italian pastes. 

With these soups, grated white cheese (parmesan, 
gruydre, or other) is offered to each guest in a dish with 
a spoon. 

BriUat SavarirCs Elixir of Life ; a restorative after 
exhaustion. By exhaustion is understood a state of 
weakness, languor, and prostration, the result of ante- 
cedent circumstances, which renders the exercise of the 
vital functions more difficult. Without reckoning the 
debility produced by the privation of sufficient food, in 
respect either to its quantity or its quality, exhaustion 
may be brought on by bodily fatigue, by overstrained 
mental efforts, and by too great an addiction to the plea- 
sures of life. But from whatever cause it has proceeded, 
the first step to a remedy is immediate cessation from the 
acts which have brought on, if not exactly a morbid con- 
dition, at least something very closely approaching to it.

After this indispensable preliminaiy, oookeiy can 
offer the resources which it has at its command. To 
the sufferer worn out by the prolonged exertion of his 
muscular strength, it offers good soup, generous wine, 
the meat of ftdl-grown animals, and sleep. To the 
writer or student who has allowed himself to be carried 
awaj bj the charms of his subject, it prescribes out-door 
exercise to refresh his brain, bathing to soothe his 
irritated nerves, poultry, green vegetables, and repose. 
On the worn-out pleasure-hunter it imposes a quiet 
life, and a simple yet nutritious diet In all these cases 
may be administered either Elixir Ay suited to robust 
constitutions, decided characters, people who exhaust 
themselves with action, or the second milder for- 
mula. 

A. Take six large onions, three carrots, and a hand- 
ful of parsley ; chop them up together, and throw them 
into a saucepan, in which you will heat and brown them 
by means of a lump of good fresh butter. 

When this mixture is pretty well cooked, add thereto 
six ounces of sugar-candy, twenty grains of pounded 
amber, with a toasted crust of bread and three bottles 
of water, which you will boil for three-quarters of 
an hour, adding fresh water to replace the loss by 
evaporation, so that there shall always be three bottles of 
liquid in the saucepan. 

While this is taking place, kill, pluck, and empty an 
old cock, whom you will cut into joints and pound (bones 
and all) in a mortar with an iron pestle. In like manner 
chop up two pounds of the very best lean beef. That done, 



BBOTHS AND S0X7PS. 171 

mix the two meate together, seaaoning with a sufficiency 
of pepper and salt 

Put them in a saucepan over a brisk iSre, so as to 
let them get thoroughly heated, throwing in fix>m time 
to time a little fresh butter, in order to favier the mix- 
ture well, without its sticking to the bottom of the pan. 

When it is nicely browned, jou strain the broth 
which is in the other saucepan, and pour it, little by 
little, into the second, stirring meanwhile nntfl it is afl 
there. Tou then let it boil galloping three-quarters of 
an hour, taking care to add hot water, so ad always to 
have the same quantity of liquid. At the end of that 
time, the operation is complete, and you have a potion 
whose beneficial effects are infallible, supposing that the 
patient — ^however exhausted by any of the above-men- 
tioned causes— has a stomach which stiU performs its 
fimctions. 

The dose is, the first day, a cupfiil every three 
hours until bedtime; the following days, a breakfast- 
cupful morning and night only, until the three bottles 
are emptied. The patient is kept to a light but nutri- 
tious diet, such as the thighs of fowls, fish, ripe fruit, 
preserves. It rarely happens that a firesh pot of soup 
has to be made. About the fourth day, he may resume 
his ordinary occupations, and ought to try to be more 
prudent for the future — if possible. 

By suppressing the amber and the sugar-candy, you 
can by this method improvise a high-flavoured soup, 
worthy to be set before a party of connoisseurs. If the 
old cock be replaced by four old partridges, and the beef 



172 BROTHS AND SOUPS. 

by the same qoantity of leg of mutton, the resultrng 
preparation will be neither less efficacious nor less agree- 
able. 

The plan of chopping up the meat and browning it 
in butter before moistening it with the broth may be 
generalised in every case where time is pressing ; and 
when the exhaustion is extreme, delays are dangerous, 
if not fatal. It is based on the principle that meat so 
treated becomes charged with more caloric (or, since 
caloric is obsolete, is heated to a higher temperature) 
than it could be in water. It can, therefore, be employed 
on every occasion when a good meat soup is wanted, 
without having to wait for it five or six hours. Such 
oc(;asions are frequent, especially in the country. It is 
understood that all who make use of it will glorify the 
inventor (and also the present communicator) of the 
mode. 

N.B. It is right that every body should know that 
aml3er, considered as a perfume, may be injurious to the 
uninitiated whose nerves are delicate ; taken internally, 
it is sovereignly tonic and exhilarating. Our ancestors 
employed it largely in the kitchen, and found themselves 
none the worse for it 

Marshal Richelieu habitually kept an ambered pastille 
in his mouth. For my own part, whenever I (Brillat 
Savarin) find myself in one of those days when the 
weight of age makes itself felt, when thought flows 
sluggishly, and one feels overpowered by an imaccustomed 
oppression, I mix with a little sugar, in a strong cup o^ 
chocolate, a quantity of pounded amber about the size of

a horse-bean, and have always derived wonderful benefit 
from it By means of this tonic, vital action is freely 
performed and thought « ea^, without the deprivation 
of sleep, which would be the inevitable consequence of a 
cup of coffee taken for the purpose of producing the 
same effect 

Elixir B. Take a knuckle of veal weighing at least 
two pounds and a half. Split it into four, lengthwise, 
bone and flesh. Brown it with butter in a saucepan? 
with four sliced onions and a handfrd of watercress. 
When it is nearly cooked enough, pour over it three 
bottles of water. Boil two hours, taking care to replace the 
quantity evaporated. Season moderately with pepper and 
salt, and you will have a stock of excellent Yeal Broth. 

Pound separately three old pigeons, and twenty- 
five living fresh-water crawfish [if not to be had, take 
twice the number of prawns or shrimps]. Mix them 
together, and brown them in butter, as directed for 
Elixir A ; and when you see that £he heat has penetrated 
the mass, and that it is beginning to get crispy, add the 
veal broth to it, and boil galloping for an hour. The 
broth, so> enriched, is to be strained. It may be taken 
morning and night, or at morning only. It is also a 
delicious soup. 

Poached'Egg Soup. Have ready the required quantity 
of well-flavoured stock broth. When it boils, take as 
many eggs as there are to be persons at table, and poach 
them in it as hereafter directed. When done, take them 
out with a slice or skimmer, lay them on a warm dish, 
and trim off any ragged edges. 



174 BBOTHS AND SOUPS. 

Put a thin layer of bread-dioe (toasted or fried) at 
the bottom of your soup-tureen ; on this deposit your 
poached eggs^ taking care not to break the yolks^ and 
pour over all the boiling stock through a cullender. 

In servings distribute one poached egg and a portion 
of bread-dice in each person's plate. 

Fried Bread-Dicefar Soups. The Doctor recommends 
simply toasted dice ; but for those who vrUl have them 
fried, do it thus : 

Cut the crumb of stale bread into dice, and let them 
dry a little before the fire, turning them occasionaUy. 

Have a deep frying pan (see chapter Operations, 
page 51) half full of the best olive-oil, fresh butter, or 
sweet pork-lard. When hot enough (which you will 
ascertain by trjring it with a strip of bread), plunge 
your dice into it, and the moment they are brown enough, 
take them out with your shoe. Let them drain awhile 
on a towel, and they are ready to serve. Dice so fried 
will be much more crisp and less greasy than if done in 
a shallow frying-pan, with a little butter, by turning 
them over from side to side. If the quantity of fat 
required be complained of, the Doctor replies that it will 
serve for other purposes, and that you can't expect to 
make Egyptian bricks without straw, nor to cook without 
consuming fuel, nor to fry without fat. 

Meager Broth A basis for all the varieties of soup- 
maigre, and of sauces to serve with meager dishes. 

Slice into a soup-kettle ten carrots, as many turnips 
and onions, two lettuces, two sticks of celery, one parsnip, 
half a cabbage, and a handfril of chervil Add to these 



BBOTHS AND SOUPS. 175 

vegetables half a pound of butter, and a pint of water. 
Cover close, and let it boil gentlj till there is hardly any 
liquid left in the pot. Then fill up with boiling water, 
and add either a quart of green pease or the pur6e fh,m 
a quart of split pease, two or three cloves, pepper and 
salt. Continue te boil for three or four hours, and pass 
the bfoth through a cullender. 

Sorrel and Potato Soup^Maigre. Boil your potatoes 
separately ; mealy ones are the best When done, take 
them out, drain well, and mash fine. 

Take a couple of handfuls of sorrel, strip the green 
part of the leaves away from the midrib ; wash, chop 
them coarsely, and put them into a stew-pan with a good 
lump of butter. When stewed te a pulp, add a little 
meager broth, then mix in your mashed potatoes, fill up 
with more broth to the quantity required, season with 
pepper and salt, boil up again, and serve accompanied by 
toasted bread-dice. 

The extent to which vegetable meager soups may be 
varied is almost incalculable. The above receipts convey 
the principle on which the whole of them are prepared. 
They may be easily thickened, either with yolk of egg, 
or arrowroot, or other farinaceous substance. The intelli- 
gent cook will have no difficulty in composing, for occa- 
sions of abstinence firom meat, pottages to be named 
after such leading constituents as lentils, haricots, beans, 
celery, leeks, cabbages, turnips, spinach, cauliflower, and 
the like. They are equally agreeable and wholesome to 
persons whose business keeps them much confined in 
towns ; and they can always be made better by the use of 



176 BROTHS AND S0UP8, 

broth instead of water, when no reasons of ccmscienoe or 
health prevent. The only difficulty is, that some of the 
small herbs — as chervil, orache, purslane, chives — are 
not found in every market ; but they are of the easiest 
culture for those who have a garden, and would be

regiment, reached a solitary farmhouse at about two 
o'clock on a summer's afternoon. The kitchen-door 
stood wide open, and allowed him to see an active old 
dame busily turning a barrel-chum. Every body else 
was at work in the fields. He gave a respectful military 
salute; but before he could cross the threshold, she 
screamed to him : 

" It's no use your coming here ; we never give any 
thing to tramps." 

" I'm not a tramp, ma'am," he replied ; " but a 
soldier, tired and hungry too ; and I don't ask you to 
give me any thing, only to let me boil some broth out of 
this bit of flint." 

" It's poor broth you'll get out of that, when you 
have washed it clean. But you'll have to go and fetch 
the water from the well." 

^^ Certainly, ma'am ; and a bucket or two besides for 
you, if you want them, with the greatest of pleasure." 

" Bring me tliree, then, and pour them into the 
water-tub there. Very good. I see you're a handy 
young man. There's the fire, and there's the pot ; you'll 
have to make your flint broth yourself. I've enough to 
do to attend to my churn."

^^ May I go into the garden, ma'am, to pick a few 
green leaves, jnst to give a little taste to my broth, 
ma'am ?" 

" You may, if you like. You'll find plenty of green 
weeds, and not much else. Farmers like we, with a 
little bit o' land, can't waste our time about our gardens. 
— ^What a while he is gone! I'm thinking he'll be 
stripping the gooseberry-bushes. — ^Well, what have you 
got there ? A couple of lettuces I" 

"Yes, ma'am; you see they're starting for seed; 
they'd be good for nothing the day after to-morrow." 

" Maybe; and parsley, and chives, and young celery- 
plants I Why, I didn't know we had any in the garden." 

** Plenty, ma'am, only smothered with weeds ; so I 
pulled up the weeds, and threw them over the hedge. 
You'll have parsley and diives, now, all smnmer long, 
and perhaps all winter toa" 

(Adde.) " They'll fetch a penny a bunch at market" 
(Aloud.) " You know, we never give nothing to nobody, 
but you may cut a thin slice of bacon to put in your 
broth. With that, you won't want any salt" 

*^ Thank you, ma'am, very kindly ; and I hope you 
won't be angry if, in pulling up the weeds, I pulled up, 
quite by accident, these three carrots." 

" Well, well, I suppose it couldn't be helped ; a 
carrot more or less won't send us to the workhouse. 
You may take the cold potatoes that stand on that shelf; 
you can eat your broth out of the basin ; and there's a

My broth, you see, is cooking nicely. — I've kept to your 
stroke, ma'am, and the butter is come. What beautiful 
eggs I of the Scotohy Chayney breed I What a pity that 
two of them should have got a crack !" 

^^ I don't see the cracks ; but your eyes are better 
than mine. They're no good to sell ; and we don't feed 
our ploughboys on Scotchy Chayney eggs. There ; you 
may have them, just for this once. I'll like to see what 
you'll do with them." 

^' Thank ye, ma'am, very much indeed, ma'am. I 
do this : I break the eggs, at the place that was cracked, 
into the bottom of the basin. I stir them up with a 
little of the broth ; then I pour all the rest of the broth 
into the basin. I put the flint into my pocket, to serve 
for next time, in case there should still be any goodness 
left in it ; and I break into my broth this crust of bread, 
which I saved on purpose from my breakfast this morning." 

" Nay, nay, young man, keep your crust for your 
supper ; you may cut a good slice off that brown loaf. 
I see you're very different to the travellers who won't go 
away till you give 'em a penny, and who coax victuals 
out of silly girls under pretence of telling their fortunes. 
Sure, your flint broth's ekernomical, and smells very 
good. If I hadn't had my dinner, I'd taste it myself." 

Fish Soups are hardly acclimatised on the generality 
of English dinner-tables, although few countries afford 
better materials, or a better climate, for making them.

Fish kept several days, slighilj salted and boiled, is often 
excellent in itself, although the soup made from it would 
not be delicate. The stronger flavours acquired by fish pass 
away into the boiling water. Indeed, in many people's 
opinion, certain fish (as torbot, cod, and skate) may be, 
boiled too firesh ; just as Qeorge L did not relish firesh 
oysters, but preferred them three or four days old, like 
those he used to eat at Hanover. It is a matter of habit 
and locality. But for soups, fish cannot be too fresh : 
they should jump out of the river or the sea into the pot. 
And that, in &ct, is the way in which fish soups are 
made in the south of Europe, where they are not only 
popular, but are highly esteemed in the upper regions of 
society. On the Continent, in general, fish soups of 
most simple and unpretending appearance are often very 
costly affairs. 

On the other hand, frozen fish is neither good for 
soups nor for any thing else. The northern nations eat 
it out of necessity, not choice. The convenience of 
transport gained is more than outbalanced by the dete- 
rioration of qualify. The effects of frost are to rend the 
tissues, and to reduce them to a tasteless pulp, whose 
very wholesomeness is questionable. If such is the case 
with the most substantial meats, it is still more so with 
delicate muscle, like that of fish. Meat or fish, once 
frozen, soon putrefy after thawing ; they should be used 
immediately, or not at alL Befrozen, it is difficult to 
ascertain their actual condition, and their consumption 
may cause serious derangement to health. Shell-fish 
and crustaceans, as oysters and lobsters, are soon struck

they become worse than worthless — absolutely injurious. 
Therefore, as a precautionary rule, never buy fish during 
the continuance of a frosi 

^^ That is hard upon the fishmongers/' it will be said; 
^^ it is not their fault if Providence sends irost at certain 
seasons." True ; but we hold that, during firost, fish, 
for the time, is out of season. For the sake of putting 
money into fishmongers' pockets, we are no more obliged 
to eat fish then^ than we are when it is periodically out 
of season at the naturally appointed times of the year. 
They deal in a perishable article, and calculate their 
profits accordingly. But if the fisherman and the fish- 
monger, by their care, can preserve fish from being 
frozen, from the time of its capture to its being brought 
to table, such fish, if naturally in season, is good in the 
depth of the severest winter. As to the tales of fish in 
Russia being frozen in blocks of ice alive, transported to 
long distances, and then thawed and taken out alive, the 
Doctor will believe the fact when he witnesses it — 
perhaps ; for seeing is not always believing. Until then, 
he would like to know the species of fish which are 
capable of bearing such singular treatment Some of 
our own fish, otherwise tenacious of life (the eel, for 
instance), cannot bear extremes of heat or cold. 

The British Isles, therefore, ought to be a paradise 
of fish-eaters : their climate, a happy mean between heat 
and cold, is perfectly adapted to the constitutions of all 
fish out of water ; and they have the two Channels (the 
English and St. George's), the (German Ocean, and the 



BROTHS AND SOUPS. 181 

Atlantic, for their fish-ponds, all whose waters enjoy the 
double advantage of being neither too salt nor too warm, 
as the Mediterranean is. 

Waters too salt are adverse to the &ttening and 
thriftiness of most fish, probably, also, to their increase : 
witness the ascent of rivers by fish to deposit their 
spawn, which gives us the pleasure of receiving their 
visits. Warm seas produce but poor-fleshed fish. The 
temperature of the Mediterranean waters is four or five 
degrees above the ocean temperature of the same latitude ; 
and the fish there are mostly indifferent. On the other 
hand, the Atlantic cities and towns of America owe their 
excellent fish-markets to the stream of cold water £rom 
the north which runs along the coast Maury even tells 
us that the fish of the sea afibrd perhaps the best indica- 
tion as to the cold currents in it The temperature along 
the American coast is several degrees below that of the 
ocean; and from Maine to Florida tables are supplied 
with the most excellent offish. The ^^ sheep's head" of 
thid cold current, so much esteemed in Virginia and the 
Garolinas, loses its flavour, and is considered worthless, 
when taken on the warm coral-banks of the Bahamas. 
The same is the case with other fish. In the cold water 
of that coast they ar^ delicious ; in the warm water on 
the other edge of the Gulf Stream, their flesh is soft and 
unfit for table.

charming. Whatever it be, separate it into flakes, or 
cut it up into neat mouthfuls, and put it aside. 

Pick a pint or more of fresh-boiled shrimps ; boil 
their shells in water twenty minutes. Strain the liquor 
&om the shells ; let it stand to settle while you are doing 
what follows ; then pour it off, leaving only the sediment, 
which you reject 

Brown slices of carrot and onion in butter, in a stew- 
pan, with a dust of flour. When tender, dilute gradually 
with water or broth, adding the clear liquor from the 
shrimp-shells. Season with a dust of sugar, a bunch of 
herbs, half a glass of white wine, and a sprinkle of grated 
nutmeg, or a couple of cloves. Thicken with a little 
arrowroot; boil up, stirring all the while; and pass 
through a cullender. 

Kyou have any oyster, shrimp, lobster, caper, or 
anchovy sauce remaining (if ever so little), you may add 
it to the soup, for the sake of its flavour. Throw in the 
picked shrimps and the pieces of fish, let them heat well 
through, and serve accompanied by toast-dice. 

If the quantity offish is scanty, it may be helped out 
by a dozen or two of oysters added, together with the 
liquor from them, at the same time with the shrimps. 
The oysters must not boil, but only be heated through. 

SouiUabaiase — Marseillaise or Provenfal Fish Soupy A, 
The more different kinds of fish are employed, the better 
is the Bouillabaisse. Amongst the most esteemed for 
the purpose are the sole, the whiting, the carp, and the 
Mediterranean fish caUed the loupy or wolf. 

For a Bouillabaisse for six persons, take five pounds of 



\ 



BBOTHS AKD SOUPS. 183 

fish, two dozen mnssels, the peel of half an orange, an 
onion cut in quarters, a bay-leaf, garlio, parsley, cloves, 
a little saffron, pepper and salt, and half a glass orwhite 
wine per head. 

Clean the fish thoroughly, and out it in pieoes ; put 
it, with all the above ingredients, into a stew-pan ; add 
sufficient water and olive-oil to cover the whole, and stew 
it over a brisk fire for a quarter of an hour or tweniy 
minutes. Toast or firy slices of bread, pour your bouilla- 
baisse over them, and serve as hot as possible. 

This extremely popular Mediterranean dish is rather 
a fish stew than a fish soup ; the like remark, however, 
is applicable to our ragofit soups, turtle, ox-tail, giblet, &o. 

The word bouUlabaisse means, ^^ boil up, and take off* 
the fire," showing the quick way in which it ought to be 
cooked. Oily fish — ^as herring in the north, and sardines 
in the south — ^are not admissible. If mackarel, haddock, 
or other solid fish are used, it must boil for a few minutes 
longer. The southern rule is to be liberal both with 
saffron and with oil. 

We have already given the diverse substances which 
serve as the basis of a bouillabaisse : onion, garlic, 
parsley, spice, pepper, orange-peel, saffron, and oil; 
these are indispensable. It is needless to add, that they 
must be proportioned to the quantity of fish and the 
number of guests. To these fundamental and obligatory 
ingredients, some persons add a sage-leaf; others, a sprig 
of fennel. It is not denied that such trifling accessories 
can but slightly modify the flavour of the dish ; they 
depend on the taste of individuals. In the interest of 



184 BBOTHS AND SOUPS. 

our own gastronomic reputation^ we advise the rejection 
of the fennel and the sage. 

For what to some palates is an imperceptible di£fer- 
ence, makes a very perceptible difference to others. The 
sensation of Taste resides principallj in the papillae of the 
tongue. Anatomy teaches us that all tongues are not 
equally furnished with these papillae, some having three 
times as many as others. This circumstance explains 
why, of two guests at a dinner-party, one will enjoy his 
repast with delight, while another will appear to force 
himself to eat. The reason is, that the latter's tongue is 
imperfectly organised. The Sense of Taste, like that of 
Hearing, has also its deaf-dumb individuals. 

BouiUabaiasej B. If the fish-market supplies you 
with only a limited variety ; if you can get little else 
besides mackarel, or oily fish, — such as herring, pilchard^ 
or sprats, — ^proceed as follows : 

At the bottom of your stew-pan put a few leeks (the 
white part only), cut across in very thin slices ; add oil, 
and your fish cut in slices ; fry a few minutes, until it 
begins to brown. Add the ingredients mentioned in the 
preceding receipt, with a glass of water for each person, 
and boil up rapidly over a blazing fire for a good quarter 
of an hour or so.

Take cod, mullet, whiting, torbot, or any other fish 
Tou like ; cut them cross-ways, in pieces of from tif^^o 
ounces to a quarter of a pound each. Slice two good- 
sized onions, place them in a stew-pan large enough to 
contain all the fish at the bottom — a shallow pan is best 
Add two table-spoonfiils of olive-oil ; fry the onions a 
light brown ; put in the fish with as much warm water 
as will cover them well, a teaspoonful of salt, half a 
one of pepper, half a bay-leaf, the flesh of half a peeled 
lemon cut in dice, two tomatoes cut in slices and their 
seeds removed [when no ripe tomatoes are to be had, 
bottled tomato sauce will do], two small glasses of sherr}' 
or other white wine, a few peppercorns, and half a 
clove of garlic. 

Set on a fierce fire, and boil very fast for twelve 
minutes, or till the liquor is reduced to one-third. Then 
add a table-spoonful of chopped parsley ; let it boil one 
minute longer, and pour it into a deep dish over slices 
of bread, the same as in the other receipt. 

This is also very good made with all sorts of fresh- 
water fish, and the garlic may be entirely omitted. 

N.B. From this mild receipt — especially so with the 
garlic lefl out — ^two other characteristic ingredients are 
also omitted — ^the saffron and the orange-peel. It is the 
play of Hamlet without a Prince of Denmark. But so 
far from this being a &ult, as far as invalid eaters are 
concerned, weak stomachs may honour the use of saffron 
and garlic more in the breach than in the observance.

If the dose do good, it can be repeated ; if not, it must

For persons in health, the Cook is strongly urged 
never to be frightened by the mere ingredients and

little of either to give a decided local colouring, that she 
has great liberty in the exercise of her own discretion. 

Moreover, strange dishes afford subject for conver- 
sation, which need not by any means be either futile or 
epicurean merely. Thus, our Bouillabaisse would lead 
to a discussion of the peculiarities both of the Proven9al 
climate and of the waters of the Mediterranean Sea ; of 
their effects on delicate constitutions; what fish, only 
rare accidents here, are common there, and what others,

According to the Doctor's ideas, the practical value

they afford to persons totally ignorant of the art, as in 
their suggestiveness to heads of households who do know 
something about it. A lady is puzzled how to vary, 
agreeably and economically, her day's bill of iare. 
She consults her Books — and there are many good ones 
— and, without slavishly following their indications, 
adapts them to her own tastes and circumstances. A

sprinkle them with olive-oil in proportion to the quantity 
of bread, pour over all the broth, without the garlic and

following receipt is one of the most economical 

Crawfish, being partially and locally distributed in 
streams, have often to be procm^ from considerable 
distances. They are in great request with foreign cooks, 
— ^more, however, to flatter the ear and please the eye than 
to gratify the palate. Miniature lobsters, of as bright 
a red, they are invaluable for garnishing. They are 
made to accompany almost every thing which is not 
sweet, even a dish so incongruous to their nature as 
Mock-Turtle in Hash — Tite de Veau a la ToHue — of 
which they are an indispensable ornament. Their flesh, 
although extremely delicate, is quite inferior in firmness 
and sapidiiy to that of the prawn, the lobster, or the 
shrimp ; and a Mock Bisque made with either of those 
crustaceans is quite as good as a real Crawfish Bisque : 
the latter, indeed, often condescends to borrow assistance 
of the lobster. 

Take fifty live crawfish ; boil them in a small quan- 
tity of water seasoned with salt, coarse ground or whole 
pepper, parsley, and onion. Let them cook twenty 
minutes aft;er boiling up, stirring now and then to have 
them all done alike. Drain them, and let them cool. 
If wished to be highly flavoured of the liquor or court" 
bouiUony they may be left to cool in it. 

When cool, pick out the flesh of the tails, half open 
them, to take out the black thread or intestine which 
runs through their whole length. Pick also the flesh of 
such claws as are big enough to be worth the trouble. 
Set all these aside together.

Pound all the rest^ shells and heads, very small in a 
marble mortar, reducing them to a paste with a lump of 
butter. Put this paste into a stew-pan with sufficient 
water, and boil till all the goodness is extracted ; then 
strain and squeeze it through a fine-holed cullender. 
Add the requisite quantity of veal stock, or fish or meager 
broth, and boil up again. Arrange at the bottom of the 
soup-tureen fried bread-dice and the flesh of the crawfish ; 
pour the soup over it, and serve. 

Bisques of Crawfish are enriched both by employing 
a greater number of fish, and by the addition of cream, 
pounded lobster-spawn, or, better, coral, pounded hard 
yolks of egg, or the pounded flesh of boiled soles, all or 
either at the cook's discretion. 

The consideration which is still attached to crawfish 
probably originated in their being the only crustaceans 
attainable in inland districts, whose remoteness from the 
sea deprived them of other shell-fish, with which they 
are now supplied abundantly by raiL It is likely that 
fresh-water crawfish, without being altogether discarded 
or despised for the future, may nevertheless have seen 
their most glorious days. 

Ot/ster Soup, The number of oysters to be used will 
depend upon their size. Eight or ten natives, or half 
a dozen large Channel oysters to each guest, is a fiur 
allowance. When the oysters are opened, save all their 
liquor, and at the same time have their beards removed, 
putting the oysters into one bowl and the beards in 
another. Set the beards on the fire in a saucepan, well 
covered with cold water ; boil them tiU all their goodness

through a cullender into the oyster liquor that had been 
saved* 

Make a white roux with butter and flour ; bring it 
graduaUj to the thickness required with half milk and 
half clear veal stock; season with salt, pepper, and 
grated nutmeg ; stir in the liquor firom the oysters and 
the beards ; strain through a cullender, to get rid of 
knots, bits of shell, &c. 

Betum this soup to the stew-pan, put in the oysters, 
and set it on the fire, stirring gently but continuously. 
Before it boils, take it off and pour it into the soup- 
tureen, which may have a few fried or toasted bread- 
dice at the bottom. If the oysters are boiled for any 
length of time, they become leathery and indigestible ; 
heated nearly to the boiling point, they retain all their 
tenderness, at the same time that their flavour is height- 
ened by the cooking. This point is the great nicety to 
observe both in oyster sauce and oyster soup. In neither 
should the oysters taste raw or feel cold in the mouth ; 
while most people know the unpleasantness of oysters 
vulcanised till they would serve to mend a hole in a 
shoe. 

The above receipt gives Oyster Soupj White, It may 
be easily varied thus : omit the nutmeg from the season- 
ing, and use a little cayenne, a dessert or table-spoonfril

into the boUing soup^ after it has passed through the 
cullender, and before the cooking of the oysters. 

Either form of oyster soup is an agreeable change 
from the ordinary routine of bills of fare. The first 
should be kept mild and delicate for fastidious stomachs ; 
the second (which may be ftirther enriched by cream 
and egg-yolks) may be seasoned up to the standard of 
dining-out palates. N.B. In many sea-side localities, 
similar soups (which are held in great esteem) are made 
with mussels, cockles, or a combination of all these three 
shell-fisL In America, Clam Soups, made in various 
ways, are equally popular. Of the Razor-fish, or Solen 
(found on the Norfolk coast, in the neighbourhood of 
Stifi^key, and elsewhere), Soyer says : " This is a beau- 
tiful-eating fish. It is seldom we get it in London, 
being used by the fishermen for bait. It should be 
cooked like oysters, and makes most excellent and 
strengthening soup.'' 

Salmon Soup. Take a pound and a half of the middle 
or tail of a very fresh salmon. Salmon just a little stale, 
which, with management, is perfecfly presentable as a 
dish offiahj will not make a tureen of soup. 

Cut the piece of salmon across into two equal por- 
tions ; clean and scale them most carefully, and then 
throw them into a pot of boHmg water with no salt in it ; 
boil till enough — ^about twenty minutes. Remove the 
skin, and take the flesh off the bones while hot Divide 
one of the pieces into handsome flakes or spoon-bits, and 
set them aside. Pound the other portion fine in a 
mortar, with a little butter, an anchovy scaled and boned,

or its equivalent in the shape of essence of anchovy, the 
coral or spawn of a lobster if to be had, a table-spoonful 
of flour or arrowroot, and a couple of hard egg-yolks. 

When these ingredients are well pounded and braided, 
transfer them to a stew-pan with a little clear stock, 
consomm^, or veal or chicken broth. Stir and add 
gradually more and more stock, till the soup is of the 
required thickness. Season with pepper and salt; if 
intended for a party of good livers, it may be heightened 
with a bouquet of herbs and an imperceptible quantity 
of cayenne, sugar, and lemon-juice. Pass through a 
large-holed cullender ; put in the flakes of salmon that 
had been set aside, boU up, and serve. This being a 
substantial ^^ mouthful soup," forcemeat balls or egg 
balls are quite admissible. Bread is also to be eaten 
with it, either in browned dice, or broken by each person 
firom the roll beside him. 

It is obvious that similar excellent soups may be 
made, by the same mode of preparation, from all our 
larger and firmer-fleshed fish, as cod, turbot, pike, conger 
eel, &c. Aberdeenshire skate soup is highly extolled and 
relished in its native locality ; but it is feared that the 
flavour of that fish, in soup, might prove too strong for 
southern palates. 

Eel Soup is better prepared the day before wanted, 
for the sake of more completely removing the fat, which 
is apt to disagree with delicate stomachs. 

Skin the eels ; cut them into lengths of about two 
inches, and let them cleanse two or three hours in stronor 
salt and water. 



194 BROTHS AND SOUPS. 

Throw them into boiling water, with no salt, but with 
pepper, allspice, a blade of mace, and a bmich of parsley. 
When done, take out, and set aside. Beduce the liquor 
hj boiling to the quantity required; strain, cool, and 
take off the fat. 

Make a roux with butter, flour, and chopped onion ; 
moisten with the liquor from the eels. Strain, season 
with cayenne and lemon-juice ; throw in the eels, boil 
up, and serve. 

This, being a ^' mouthful soup,'' may be garnished 
with the proper accompaniments; or the eels may be 
half boiled and half fried, which will make it still more 
of a rago{lt»

FISH. 

MiOHELET, in his remarkable chapter on Renaissance or 
Benewal of the Bodily Powers through the agency of 
the Sea, on sending his lady patient to the coast, makes 
her asky ^^ But what do people live on there ?'* 

" Principally on fish, Madame." 

" And what else ?" 

« On fish, Madame." 

Brillat Savarin's speculations on fish are too remark- 
able to be omitted here, especially when we remember 
that they were written half a century ago. 

Certain learned men, he says, whose ortliodoxy is not 
without suspicion, have maintained that Ocean was the 
common cradle of every existing living creature ; that 
the human race itself was bom in the sea, and that it 
owes its actual condition simply to the influence and the 
habits which it was obliged to assume in consequence of 
its change of dwelling-place. 

However that may be, at least it is certain that the 
realm of waters contains an immense multitude of beings, 
of every form and of all dimensions, who enjoy the gift 
of vitality in very different proportions, and according to 
a mode which is not that of warm-blooded animals. 
Equally true is it, that it presents us, all the world over 
and at every season, with an enormous mass of alimen- 



196 nsH. 

tary snbstanoes, and tihat^ even in the present state of 
our knowledge, it supplies our tables with most agree- 
able varieiy. 

Fishy less nutritious than flesh, more succulent than 
vegetables, is a mezzo terminer a happy mean, which suits 
almost every temperament, and which may be allowed 
fiven to convalescents. 

The Greeks and the Romans, although &r behind- 
hand, with respect to ourselves, in the art of dressing 
fish, nevertheless held it in very high esteem, and were 
epicures enough to be able to pronounce from its flavour 
in what waters such or such fish had been caught They 
kept it in fish-ponds ; and we have all heard of the cruelty 
of Yadius Pollio, who fed his murenae on the flesh of 
daves whom he had put to death — a crime which the 
Emperor Domitian strongly blamed, but which he ought 
rather to have publicly punished. 

Certain peoples, in consequence of their position, are 
compelled to live almost entirely on fish ; they likewise 
give it as food to their domestic animals, who accustom 
themselves, through necessity, to this strange diet They 
even manure their land with it Nevertheless, the neigh- 
bouring seas do not cease to furnish them with an equally 
abundant supply. 

It has been remarked that these people have less 
corporeal strength and energy than those who mainly 
live on flesh. Their complexions are pale ; which is not 
surprising, seeing that, from the elements of which fish 
is composed, it ought rather to augment their lymph 
than renovate their blood. 



nsH. 197 

It has alsoboCT obserredthat lohthjophagous nations 
have furnished nmnerons examples of longevity ; either 
because their light and unsubstantial diet preserves them 
from the evil effects of plethora, or because the juices 
contained in it being destined by Nature to form only 
fish-bone* and cartilage, which nerer have a long exist- 
ence,f their habitual use retards, by several years, in 
Man, the solidification of all the bodily organs, which 
finally becomes the necessaiy cause of natural death. 

Serious discussions have arisen on the question. Which 
is the best, which takes precedence in respect to merit, 
sea-fish or river-fish ? The quarrel will probably never 
be settled,' in conformity with the Spanish proverb, Sdbrg 
hs gustos^ no hai disputa^ which has its equivalent both 
in Latin and English. It is wiser to tolerate other 
people's tastes than to squabble about them. Every one 
is affected by them in his own pecuUar way. These 
fugitive sensations cannot be expressed by any known 
symbol or character, and there is no scale offish-flavours 
or ichthyometer to tell us whether a cod, a turbot, or a 
sole is superior to a salmon trout, a full-grown pike,t or 
even a tench of seven or eight pounds. 

* The French hare a special word, ariU^ to signify fish-bone, in 
contradistinction to os, the bones of animals and men. 

f On the contrary, many fish, as the carp, the pike, and others, are 
remarkable for their longevity nnder favourable circumstances ; and 
the cartilaginous fishes are supposed to have no definite term of exist- 
ence, but to live on and on until cut off by accident. Their invariable 
fate is not a natural but a violent death. In the Indian Ocean there 
are said to be members of the skate or ray family big enough to devour 
a man. 

X With all due deference, and in spite of the proverb, " Old fish, 
young flesh," the biggest pike are not the best ; and the remark holds 



198 FISH. 

It is fully admitted that fish is much less nutritious 
than meat ; either because it contains no osmazome,* or 
because, being specifically lighter, it contains in the 
same volume a smaller quantity of matter. Shell-fish, 
and oysters especially, afford but a small amount of 
nutritive substance ; which is the reason why a great 
many can be eaten without spoiling the appetite for the 
repast which follows immediately afterwards. 

It will be remembered that, in former days, a dinner 
of any pretensions usually commenced with oysters ; and 
that there was always a good proportion of the guests 
who did not stop till they had swallowed a gross — i. e. 
twelve dozen, or one hundred and forty-four oysters. 
[Nevertheless, the Almanach des Gourmandsy 1803, states 
that, beyond five or six dozen — as a mere indispensable 

true of several other fish. A pike of six pounds is hetter than one of 
twelve ; and one of twelve pounds is less coarse and strong than one 
between twenty and thirty pounds* weight. Over-sized turbot, and 
John dory especially, are apt to be wanting in delicacy; middle-sized 
fish of those species, and even what would be called small ones, are 
mostly superior in quality to their giant brethren. 

* Osmazome is that specially sapid constituent of meat which is 
soluble in cold water, and which differs from the extractive portion by 
the latter's being soluble only in boiling water. It is osmazome which 
makes the merit of good soups, which is browned on meat in the fry- 
ing-pan, and which, candied by heat, forms the crust of roast meat, 
and from which venison and game derive their peculiar flavour. 

Osmazome is especially obtained from the dark flesh of adult ani- 
mals. It is found in much smaller quantity in lamb, sucking-pig, 
chicken, and even in the white meat of the largest poultry. That is 
the reason why true connoisseurs have always preferred the thigh of 
fowls; in their case, instinct forestalled science. It was also the pre- 
science of osmazome which has sent to the right-about numberless 
cooks caught stealing the first broth ; and which suggested to Canon 
Chevrier the invention of soup-kettles shutting with a lock and key.~ 
B.S.

prelnde to a winter d6je{lner — it is proved by experience 
that oyster-eating most certainly ceases to be an enjoy- 
ment.] I (B. S.) wished to ascertain what was tJie 
weight of this little avant-garde; and I found that a 
dozen oysters (the liqnor included) weighed /our ounces : 
which gives, for the weight of a gross, three pounds. 
Now, I feel sure that the same persons (who dined not 
a bit the worse after their oysters) would have been 
completely satiated had they eaten an equal quantity of 
meat, even were it chicken meat. Meditate this anec- 
dote. 

In 1798, 1, B. S., was at Versailles, in the capacity 
of a Commissioner of the Directory ; and I was frequently 
thrown in the way of the Sieur Laperte, Clerk to the 
Tribunal of the Department He was excessively fond 
of oysters, and complained that he had never eaten as 
many as he wished, or, in his own words, ^^ had never 
had his fill of them." 

I resolved to procure him that satisfaction, and in- 
vited him to dine with me next day. 

He came ; I kept up with him as far as the third 
dozen, aft»r which I let him go on alone. He went on 
80 as far as the thirty-second dozen — ^that is, for more 
than an hour; for the oyster-opening dame was not 
very adroit. 

Meanwhile, I sat looking on and doing nothing — a 
task which is particularly painful at table ; so I checked 
my guest in the height of his career by saying, " My 
very dear fellow, I see it is not written that you are to 
have yourfiU of oysters to-day. Let us begin our dinner." 



200 FISH. 

We did begin ; and he dined with the vigour of a 
man who had fasted for twelve hours previously. 

To whatever kind of fish the precedence is granted, 
whether to salt water or to fresh, all fish, in tlie hands of 
a skilful preparer, may be made the source of inexhaust- 
ible gustatory enjoyment. It is served whole, divided, 
cut into bits ; cooked in water, wine, and oil ; hot or 
cold; and is always received with an equally hearty 
welcome. But it never deserves a more distinguished 
reception than when appearing under the form of a 
Matelote (which see). 

This rago^Lt, although imposed by necessity on the 
fresh-water sailors who navigate our streams, and per- 
footed only by the innkeepers who dwell along the 
water's edge, is not the less obliged to them for a degree 
of excellence which is unsurpassable. Philicthysts never 
behold it appear without expressing their extreme delight, 
on account both of its frank and decided flavour, of its 
uniting in itself a number of good qualities, and because 
it can be indulged in almost indefinitely without fear of 
satiety or indigestion. 

Analytic gastronomy has sought to examine what 
are the effects of an ichthyophagous diet on the animal 
economy; and unanimous observations have demon- 
strated that it is both highly restorative and stimulant 
The result once known, two causes were speedily dis- 
covered, so immediately direct as to be comprehensible 
by every understanding; namely. First, the different 
ways of preparing fish by means of condiments which 
are evidently of an exciting nature, such as caviare, red 



FISH. 201 

herring, pickled tunny, salt cod, stock fish, and other 
like preparations; Secondly, the diverse juices with 
which fish is saturated, which are eminently inflamma- 
ble, and are oxidised and rancidified by the process of 
digestion. Further analysis has discovered a third and 
still more active stimulant ; i. e. the presence of phos- 
phorus, which is found ready-made in the milts and 
other parts, and which visibly shows itself when de- 
composition sets in. 

Fish, regarded in the entirety of its species, offers to 
the pliilosopher an inexhaustible subject of meditation 
and wonder. The varied forms of these strange crea- 
tures ; the senses which are wanting to them ; the re- 
stricted scope of those they have ; their diverse modes 
of existence ; the influence which must have been exerted 
on all those particulars by the diflference of the medium 
in which they are destined to live and breathe and move, 
— extend the sphere of our ideas, and enlarge our notions 
respecting the indefinite modifications which may be the 
result of matter, motion, and life. 

For my own (B. S.'s)part, I regard them with a 
feeling akin to respect, which arises from a thorough 
persuasion that they are undeniably antediluvian ani- 
mals ; for the grand cataclysm which drowned our 
great-great-grandfathers about the eighteenth century 
after the creation of the world was for the fish nothing 
but a time of joy, victory, and festive frolic* 

* Sir Thomas Browne amnses himself with discussing the same 
idea : *' Though earth hath engrossed the name, yet water hath proved 
the smartest g^ye ; which in forty days swallowed almost mankind 
and the living creation ; fishes not wholly escaping, except the salt 



202 FISH. 

So far our distlngaished epicure, who thus relieves 
lis from the duty of further insisting on the wholesome, 
nay, restorative results of varying a meat and vegetable 
diet with fish. The wonders worked by cod-liver oil, 
which are equally attainable by feeding on the cod itself 
and its liver ; the beneficial effects of the phosphates in 
oysters, rendering them an object of craving with many 
invalids ; the specific action of iodine on scrofulous com- 
plaints ; and tlie source whence iodine is obtained — the 
sea, — are instances in point 

Likei almost every accessory of civilised socieiy, the 
distribution of fish has been greatly affected by that 
mighty agent, the rail. There are two things which 
inevitably follow railways wherever they go, — at least, in 
Europe, — namely. Gas and Fish. On the Continent, 
especially, when you branch off from the iron path by 
diligence^ you mostly exchange the light of gas for the 
darkness visible of oil. The same is the case with 
regard to sea-fish. Throughout the Midland Counties 
of England, cod, skate, and soles were once rarities 
which were highly appreciated when people got them. 
The supply now is regular, good, and abundant ; but the 
great change effected in England has been rather a 
question of price than (as in the central parts of Europe) 
of fish or no fish. The produce of our seas has been dis- 
persed over a larger area, and prices have been equalised 
throughout that area. Dwellers along the seaboard suffer 
most from a scarcity of fisL My elder readers may re-

member^ like myself, the time when , along certain parts of 
the coast, four fine, firesh mackarel were occasionally to be 
had for a penny. Those seasons of local plenty are gone, 
never to return— until the exhaustion of our coal-fields. 
Still, it does seem hard for the inhabitant of a fishing 
town, who wants a turbot, to be obliged to order it back 
from London. The consequence of all which is, that in 
the second half of the current century inland people eat 
enormously more fish than they did in the first half; 
while dwellers near the coast still consume a consider- 
able quantity, though at a higher cost than formerly. 
The rich still get their wants supplied ; the poor (and 
not imfrequently the middle class) have to put up with 
a scanty share— which is a pity. 

Although Gas, by following the Rail, may possibly 
run short eventually, it is not so, and never will be so, 
with sea-fish. River-fish, in thickly peopled countries, 
must be carefully guarded, tended, and overseen, by fiy- 
herds and fish-keepers; but the fecundity of Ocean 
knows no limits. We may take and eat all we can take, 
without fear or scruple. We need not abstain through 
prudential motives. It is not Man who will depopulate 
the seas. A full-grown cod, or an adult seal, has con- 
sumed more fish than the most fish-dinner-loving of his 
eaters or his flayers. The grand alimentary problem 
now before Western Europe is, how to catch, cure, and 
distribute more, more, and still more sea-fish. Our pre- 
sent business is to cook it. We will first dispose of fresh- 
water fish, prefacing it by stating a knotty point, which 
has prevented very few English cooks from sleeping. 



204 nsH. 

Of all the nntritive productions, says the Almanacli 
dee Grourmandsj which a benevolent Providence has ac- 
corded to Man's appetite, there is none on which the 
industiy of a skilful artist can be more successftdlj exer- 
cised than on Fish, which are usually seen either boUed 
or taken from the frying-pan. But is there no virtue 
in a Court-Bouillon made according to the principles of 
learned Cookery ? Authors are divided on the nature 
of this sauce, or rather this cradle of every fish that is 
neither roasted, broiled, nor fried. Culinary Dispen- 
saries are full of formulas, more or less elaborate, which 
vary according to place and climate. At Lyons, for in- 
stance, it is an established principle that fish, once out of 
water, should never return to it At Paris, where wine 
is dearer, the maxim is less strictly adhered to. There 
are meaty Court-Bouillons^ and there are meager ditto ; 
and it may be supposed that the first are the savouriest : 
but as they are forbidden to Catholics on abstinence- 
days, a liquor must be extracted from roots and herbs 
as relishing as that from meats. And it is in this that 
the studies of a clever cook render him marvellous 
service, elevating him above the crowd of plain boilers 
and roasters, who merit, at the very most, the title of 
scullion. 

The Doctor, in the first place, must in duiy express 
his doubts, first, whether fish, cooked in court-bouillon, 
be as light and digestible as fish plain-boiled. He has 
known instances of its rising in the stomach, and even 
of its putting the stomach out of order. Secondly, he 
doubts whether it be an improvement to overpower the 



FISH. 205 

natural taste of a fish hy saturating it with foreign 
flavours. StiUy as there are such things as muddj, in* 
sipid, flabby-fleshed fish ; and also as it was impossible 
to ignore a preparation which takes high rank in foreign 
art, he gives one or two receipts (with their discrepan- 
cies), and allows practitioners and their employers to 
judge and decide for themselves. 

Ude^8 Court-BoutUorij far Fish au BleUy A. Take 
three carrots, four onions, six shallots, and two roots of 
parsley, which pick and wash. Mince them. Put a 
small lump of butter into a stew-pan, with the above 
roots, and fiy them till they begin to get brown. 
Moisten next with two bottles of red wine, a bottle of 
water, a handful of salt, some peppercorns, and a bunch 
of parsley and green onions, seasoned with thyme, bay- 
leaves, sweet basil, cloves, <&c. Let the whole stew for 
an hour, and then strain it through a sieve, to use as 
occasion may require. 

If you have no wine, put in some vinegar ; but vert/ 
good court-houUlon cannot be made with vinegar. This 
marinade, being stewed properly, will serve several times 
for stewing fish : but remember, each time you use it, it 
requires a little water. It would become too strong in 
the course of time. The court-bouillon is better after 
having served several times than on the first day. It is 
always good ; only add a glass of wine to it every time 
you use it Use it for marinade, &c It is excellent 
for stewing crawfiish. Any wine will do for court- 
bouillon, even if soar. 

Take some of this liquor to make Matelote Sauce, &c. 



206 FISH. 

This manner of boiling fish is too expensive in Eng- 
landy where wine is so dear ; besides, fish done in court- 
bouillon is always eaten vnih oil and vinegar^ which is not 
customary in England. So far Tide. 

Court-Bouillon^ B, is the seasoned liquor in which 
are cooked large fish, both sea and firesh water, whether 
they are intended to be eaten cold with oily or hot with a 
sauce. 

The court-bouillon is made with red or white wine 
(ordinaire) pure, or more or less diluted with water ac- 
cording to its quality, with onions, slices of carrot, a 
large bouquet complete, cloves, bay-leaves, thyme and 
sweet basil according to taste, salt, and whole pepper. 
After boiling for at least an hour, it is strained through 
a sieve. The best way is^ to make the court-bouillon first^ 
and not to cook tliefish in it until it has been straianed. 

Court-bouillon made with red wine is the veritable 
Bleu ; but a mixture of vinegar and water mxiy be substi" 
tilted for the wine* Veijuice or lemon-juice produces a 
good efiect in court-bouillon. 

A court-bouillon may be made to serve several times. 

Court-Bomllonj C. Example : Carp au Bleu. Empty 
your carp through the smallest possible orifice ; tie up it& 
head with a tape, to prevent its falling to pieces, and lay 
it in a fish-kettle proportioned to its size. 

Heat in a saucepan half a bottle of vinegar, and pour 
it boiling over your carp. Then add red wine, taking 
care to put enough for the carp to bathe in it completely 
at ease. Next put in three large onions cut in slices, two 
carrots, parsley, scallions or green onions, two or three 



FISH. 207 

baj-Ieaves, a small sprig of thymey three doves, pepper 
and salt 

Set your fish-kettle on a gentle fire, and let it sim- 
mer for an hour or thereabouts, more or less, according 
to the size of the carp. Take it off the fire, let it cool in 
the liquor in which it was cooked ; arrange it on a dish 
with a napkin in the middle, and serve. 

These several prescriptions, it will be seen, agree 
neither with each other, nor all of them with themselves. 
The truth is, that every man-cook of any pretensions has 
his own individual notions respecting Court-bouillon ; the- 
only intelligible principle being the combination of every 
ingredient that can communicate high flavour to fish. 
According to the Doctor's experience. Court-bouillon 
spoils good fish ; while inferior fish — such as roach and 
bream, and he is heretic enough to include with them 
carp — are not worth the cost of making it 

Before proceeding to the commoner ways of dressing 
fish, we will first dispose of the French mode which has 
already been mentioned with approbation, namely, the 
famous 

Matelote of Carp^ Tmchy Eeh^ or Pike. A matelote^ 
from whom the name of the dish, or the sauce, is taken^ 
is a sailor's wife, a fisherman's wife, a fishwoman. 
Consequently, the mode of preparation is more appro- 
priate to fish than to meat, although meat may bo so 
treated — of which an example shall be given. For the 
same reason — if reason it be — a matelote should contain 
several sorts of fish, the only restriction in their variety 
being, that they must all be kinds which take the same 



208 FISH. 

time to cook. Ude translates ^^ matelote"' by hotch- 
potchy properly denoting that it is a medley disL 

For a matelote of any or all the above-mentioned 
fish, after thorough cleansing and washing, let them lie 
a few hours sprinkled with salt Rinse them once more 
before cooking. If small, merely cut off the heads and 
tails ; if larger, divide the carp and tench into two or 
three pieces, and the pike and eels into convenient lengths. 

At the bottom of your stew-pan, brown button onions 
in butter. When half done, add a bouquet of sweet 
herbs, put in your fish with as much good broth as will 
just suffice to cook it, and, the addition of either red 
wine, white wine, or good cider, and stew closely covered 
until enough, taking care it does not bum. 

Arrange yomr fish in a hot, hollow dish. Let the 
gravy from which it was taken boil a minute or two, to 
reduce it, thickening it with a dust of flour dredged into 
it At the same time, make what additions or seasoning 
you think fit, such as a handfiil of picked shrimps, 
browning, essence of anchovies, Harvey's sauce, Wor- 
cestershire sauce, walnut ketchup. Pour this gravy over 
the fish, and serve garnished with diin toasted bread cut 
in triangles. 

The matelote is open to considerable variation, ac- 
cording to the cook's resources. Cold lobster, shrimp, 
egg, or oyster sauce, or simple melted butter, may be 
used as thickening. The seasoning may be cayenne or 
black pepper merely, or small pieces of hot pickles. For 
fish matelotes the gravy should always be based on the 
liquor in which the fish has been cooked. Over-day's 






FISH. 209 

julienne or other vegetable soup answers well, if watched 
to prevent burning. 

Cold matelote of eels and tench is excellent, forming 
a stiff jelly. This requires a dash of vinegar, tarragon or 
plain, and a sufficient dose of pepper. 

Any particularly fine carp or tench may be served 
whole en matelote^ for display, surrounded with eels cut 
in short lengths as usual, which are a great improve* 
ment They may also be stewed in light French op 
Gkrman wine only, unmixed with broth or soup, or in 
good sound old cider. This must be well thickened^ 
highly seasoned, and flavoured with thyme, sweet basil 
or marjoram, lemon -juice, and lemon -peel. Before 
pouring the gravy over the fish, add to and heat up with it 
previously cooked small onions and mushrooms. Gramish 
with forcemeat balls, firied roes, small toast sippets, craw- 
fish, or any thing tasty and ornamental you have at hand. 

Matelote of Rabbit, Cut up a young rabbit into joints, 
and a fine eel into short pieces. Put twelve small onions 
into a stew-pan, with just enough butter to brown them ; 
take them out, and do the same to the rabbit Add a 
tea-spoonful of flour, mix and moisten with half white 
wine (French or German) and half good broth. Put in 
the eel, the onions, some mushrooms, a bunch of sweet 
herbs, a clove of garlic split in two, pepper, salt, and 
nutmeg. Boil galloping. When done, arrange the 
rabbit in the middle of the dish, with tlie eel round it. 
Take out the bouquet and the garlic. Boil the sauce a 
couple of minutes, pour it over the rabbit, and serve 
gamisbed with firied bread.

Matelote of Carp (or other fresh-water fish) a la 
Marinih'e — Mariner's Matelote. Scale and cut up your 
fish into lengths ; put them in a stew-pan or veiy deep 
fiying-pan, with a good lump of butter, bouquet com- 
plete, clove of garlic, pepper, salt, and a tumbler or more 
of red vin ordinaire. Set them on a brisk fire, and let 
boil for five minutes. 

Throw in a good glass of brandy, set fire to it, and let 
it bum. Cook separately in a saucepan-browning them 
nicely — a few small onions, with which you can warm 
up a few mushrooms. 

-A^y^n^^^go your fish, when tender, on a dish, garnishing 
it first with toasted bread, then with the onions and 
mushrooms. Thicken the sauce with a lump of butter 
worked into the flour, boil up, and pour it over your dish 
of fish. The pieces of fish should not be so much done 
as to fall to pieces when touched with a spoon, but ought 
to retain their orginal form at the same time that they 
are done enough. 

The boiling offish calls for a word of explanation. 
Theory teaches us that, to fix the albumine and retain it 
in the article cooked, instead of letting it partially dissolve 
in the water, that article should be plunged into hoiling 
water. But there are circumstances in which the doing 
so may be counterbalanced by still greater disadvantages. 
For instance, if a very large fish be set on to cook in 
boiling water, the thin parts, as the tail and the belly, 
will be cooked, while the thick part of the middle and 
shoulders will be still underdone and adhere to the bone. 

To obviate this inconvenience, it is clearly better, 



FISH. 211 

when a piece of fish exceeds a certain thickness, to 
immerse it in a fish-kettle of cold or tepid salt and 
water. By this means, the whole mass will be graduallj 
heated, and when the boiling point is attained outside, 
the inside will have already reached a temperature of 
considerable elevation ; so that, in the end, the whole 
will be more equally cooked throughout, avoiding the 
unpleasantness of having part of the fish falling to pieces 
while other parts are red and raw. 

The case is exactly the same as that of frozen meat, 
which should always be completely thawed throughout 
(t. €. should have the general temperature of its mass 
gradually raised) before being put to cook either by 
boiling of roasting. Otherwise — ^in the latter mode 
-especially — the outer crust may be burnt to a cinder 
while the centre is yet bloody and uneatable. It has not 
yet had ilie time for its temperature to be raised from the 
freezing to the boiling point and upwards. If heat could 
be darted suddenly, like a flash of lightning, through a 
Joint, we might plunge the largest fish into boiling water 
without risk of its being unequally cooked, and conse- 
quently injured ; but as heat penetrates quite gradually 
from without a solid object to within, we must modify 
our culmary proceedings in obedience to the feet Small 
or thin flat fish, therefSe, as whiting, soles, &c., may be 
plunged into boiling water ; large fish, whole or in pieces 
of considerable size, had better be set on in tepid water. 
It is understood that water for boiling all fish except 
salt fish should hold a certain proportion of salt in 
solution. Quin (fai^ous as an epicure as well as an actor),

whenever he carried a John dory inland from the coast, 
had a barrel of sea-toater strapped behind his post-diaise 
to boil it (the dory) in. 

Wlien large fish, as cod or salmon, is crimped, or 
slashed after death in imitation of crimping, tlic fish may 
be dropped into hot water, if the distance between the 
slashes is but small. The same of cod, salmon, turbot, 
or halibut cut in slices. The cook, in every doubtful 
case, must be guided by her own discretion and ex* 
perience. 

Fish while boiling should be skimmed at least as 
carefully as meat When done enough, if not wanted 
immediately, it must not be left to coddle in the water, 
which would soften it and soak the flavour out of it. 
Lift it out on the false bottom or strainer ; which set on 
the top of the fish-kettle diagonally or cross-wise. Soak 
a napkin in the hot liquor of the kettle, spread it over the 
fish, so as to retain tlie steam, and it will keep hot for a 
considerable time. 

As to removing the scales of fish, professors difier. 
Here is a receipt which absolutely forbids it : 

Pike au Bleu and in Court^BouUlon. Take a pike of 
from six to eight pounds, do not scale ity but let it hang 
for two or three days, and then cook it in exactly the 
same way as Carp au Bleu. You will also serve it on a 
white napkin, and eat it either cold, with oil and vinegar, 
or hot, with caper sauce. 

Something must depend on the kind of fish. The 
scales left on perch would be an absolute nuisance, and 
they must necessarily be removed firom the siuface of a 



FISH. 213 

fish of which tho skin is eaten, as the under sicTo of sole 
or turbot. Many people eat the skin of boiled salmon, 
which is both palatable and nutritious ; but if the scales 
are left on for the sake of ornament, it prevents their 
doing so* Scales left on boiled fish can do no good ; on 
baked fish, they may perhaps help to retain the natural 
juices, but they spoil the gravy, which might otherwise 
either serve for sauce or, at least, help to make it. 
On the whole, we vote with those who hold tliat in all 
cases it is a much neater style of cookery to remove the 
scales of fish. 

In every case, the gills should be taken out as soon 
as a fish comes into your possession; but in inland 
localities, where fish is scarce, it is usual to serve it, 
especially fried, with all its finny adornments unmutilated. 
Middle-sized pike, trout, barbel, or carp, with their fins 
on, fished out of a lake of boiling fat, reposing on a 
snowy napkin, and bedecked with a garland of fresh, 
bright parsley, are a very pretty sight on a dinner-table. 

Tlie Salmon is the king of fresh-water fish. In reality 
he is a Prince of the Sea ; but as he is so obliging as to 
ascend our streams, we class him, for convenience, with 
their other inhabitants. Tlie more recently a salmon has 
left the sea, the more highly he is esteemed, — the mode 
of testing which, although not often to be practised on the 
fishmonger's stall, is perfectly well known to fishermen. 
The salmon, like other nobler creatures, is infested with 
snndiy parasites, some of which are peculiar to salt 
water, and others to fresh. When a salmon has a '^ sea 
louse" sticking to his back — an ugly thing, about as big 



214 FISH. 

as a sheep tide — ^he is sure to be a fresh-mn fish, for it 
would drop off after a few hours' sojourn in river-water. 
On the other hand, when a salmon, after spawning, and 
through a lengthened stay in river-water, has become 
what is called " foul" (out of season, black-complexioned^ 
big-headed, thin-bodied), his gills are infested by white 
ihread-like worms, which are believed to be got rid of 
only by his return to the sea. 

Salmon is expensive in the earlier months of the year, 
from February (when the season opens) till May or June, 
because he will keep, and can wait for a purchaser 
without manifesting impatience. He is rarely served 
whole, except on opulent tables, on occasions of etiquette 
and ceremony suitable to his native digniiy. Cooked to 
a bubble, and tastily garnished, he is then a goodly 
sight, which many people would pay money to see, if 
only to bring the water into their mouths — just as, a 
few years since, in Paris, a million of money (francs) 
exhibited as a show attracted crowds of beholders whose 
capital scarcely sufficed to keep the demon out of their 
pockets. 

Boiled Salmon is simple enough, and as good as 
simple, if eaten in moderation. The foregoing directions 
ought to suffice. Tlie fish being scaled and cleaned 
(if diere is roe, it is usual to leave it inside, without 
opening the belly, but removing the intestines), it is laid 
on the false bottom of the fish-kettle, and so immersed, 
if in slices into hot, if in a large piece into cold, salt-and- 
water. When done, it must be adroitly slipped off the 
fijse bottom on to tlie napkin on the dish which is to 



FISH. 215 

receive it, and garnished with green fennel, parsley^ or 
scraped horse-radish. There should be no poking it in 
the fish-kettle with knives or forks, to ascertain whether 
it is done ; the cook ought to know that by the look of it, 
the time it has been in, and the rate at which it has 
boiled. A cut out of the middle of a moderate-sized 
fish will take from twenty to five-and-thirty minutes; 
the tail part less, and slices still less. 

Lobster, anchovy, or shrimp sauce may be served 
with salmon ; but it really has little need of help ftom 
sauce. Some good plain melted butter, with which a little 
mustard and vinegar can be mixed on the plates of those 
who like it, is as good and digestive an accompaniment 
as any. 

Soused Salmon. 1£ any is left cold, put it in a deep 
dish, dust pepper over it, and then pour over all half 
strong vinegar and half salmon-boilings, just enough to 
cover it, and it will be excellent to eat cold for several 
days. If you have a whole salmon, more than you 
want to serve at once, after selecting tlie piece to appear 
at dinner, cut the rest into convenient-sized slices, and 
boil the whole togetlier (they will all be the better for the 
association) in as small a quantity of salt-and-water as

ones, and you will have a capital imitation of Pickled 
Salmon^ if not the real tiling. 

Salmon so treated is not only presentable unadorned 
at any meal, but also furnishes the material either for 
a Salmon Scdadj or that more elegant and elaborate dish, 
a Mat/omiaise of Salmon, 

Don't eat sliced cucumber with hot boiled salmon ; 
but there is no harm in your having a plate of it handed 
round, to be looked at and to^difluse its smell.* 

Salmon Steaks. Cut the fish completely across in 
slices about an inch thick. Dry them well between the 
folds of a napkin. If for fiying, they may be dusted 
with flour, which can be spread evenly over their surface 
with a feather ; if for grilling, they can be seasoned with 
the slightest sprinkling of pepper and salt In the latter 
case, the turning must be adroitly performed with steak- 
tongs. Either anchovy or caper sauce goes well with 
salmon steaks, which are admirably adapted to a t^te-^- 
tSte repast or an impromptu dinner at a wayside hotel 
while your horses are baiting and reposing a while. The

The Canon BoUet, gathered to his fathers long ago, was a tippler 
of the old school. He fell sick, and the first word uttered by his 
doctor was the prohibition to touch a drop of wine. Notwithstanding 
which, the next time he called, he found the patient in bed, opposite 
to which stood in state the thing forbidden ; namely, a table covered 
with a snow-white cloth, a crystal goblet, a venerable black bottle, 
and a napkin ready to wipe the lips. 

Beholding which, the doctor went into a rage, threatening to leave 
the sick man to his own devices ; when the Canon pleaded, with a 
lamentable voice, "But, doctor, when you forbade my drinking, you 
did not deny me the pleasure of looking at the bottle." 



FISH. 217 

Doctor and his womankind have a keen remembrance 
of partaking, in the neighbourhood of die Swiss-Italian 
Lakes, of dishes of steaks thus speedily cut out of the 
Great Lake Trout, Salino ferox. This fish may, fortu- 
nately, be enjoyed, without going quite so far, by visitors 
to that noble piece of water. Loch Awe, Scotland. 

All other ways of presenting Fresh Salmon, or Great 
Lake Trout, besides the above, we hold to derogate &om 
the dignity of the fish. Potted and Collared Salmon are 
not so good as, and more troublesome than. Pickled 
Salmon. Baked Salmon, Salmon done in Court-Bouillon, 
Salmon stewed in Champagne and served with a garnish- 
ing of turkey-pinions, are heresies or eccentricities which 
may amuse for a while, but which will take no firm hold 
of the British epicure's affections. 

ISpper Salmouy an excellent Scotch relish for 
breakfast, is best procured ready smoked and dried than 
to attempt to prepare it at home. Cut it into thinnish 
slices, and broil or toast it, or set it a few minutes in a 
gentle oven. When very salt and dry, it is the better for 
steeping; indeed, in all cases, provided the steeping is 
not continued too long. 

Salted Salmon^ prepared in Norway, may be obtained 
vid Dunkirk, and otherwise. It merits more respectful 
attention from the British consumer than it has hitherto 
received. 

Salmon Trout is dressed exactly like Salmon ; plain 
boiling is the very best way. It has the advantage of 
being somewhat lighter than that fish, and, therefore, 
more suitable for delicate stomachs. 



218 FISH. 

The common Trout enjoys, as a dainty, a reputation 
perhaps superior to its actual deserts ; but it is a beauti- 
ful fish, afibrds excellent sport, and makes an attrac- 
tive and digestible dish. It may be either £ried, grilled^ 
or boiled ; in the latter case, put plenty of vinegar in the 
water. Or it may be stewed in strong veal stock, 
flavoured with wine, lemon-juice, aromatic herbs, and 
pepper and salt. Left to cool in the dish, surrounded 
with this gravy, it can be presented as Trout in Savoury 
Jelly when cold. It is also excellent potted, like mackarel 
(p. 84) ; only care must be tak^i that it do not fall to 
pieces in consequence of being over-done. 

The Charrj an Alpine species of Trout, is principally 
known from its furnishing, potted, a choice but somewhat 
expensive hors dCoeuvre. The best charr are in Coniston 
waters, but they are good every where, especially to the 
hungry traveller sitting at table within sight of the 
waters whence they have just been fished. The potted 
charr of Coniston is sent, as every epicure knows, to all 
parts of the world where men know what is good.— Jlfiw 
Martineau^s Guide to Windermere. 

The Snielt is one of the most delicious of fish, but it 
is doubtful whether it agrees with weak digestions. It is 
apt to rise after eating, unless kept down with an extra 
glass of wine or out-door exercise. 

There is only one legitimate way of dressing smelts. 
Wash well, but do not empty them ; dry them well in 
the folds of a napkin ; roU them in flour, or, if veiy fine, 
it is allowable to dip them in batter. Fry in plenty of 
boiling fat, and serve piping hot on a napkin. A very 



FISH. 219 

short time suffices to do them ; when of a clear, light 
brown they are enoagh. Gkunish with slices of lemon 
and fried parsley, and let a plate of brown bread and 
batter be in attendance on them. 

White-bait (the smallest known species of the herring 
genus, and not, as was once supposed, the fry of another 
fish) are dressed and served exactly like smelts; only, being 
smaller, they require less time and more carefid watching. 

Fried smelts are excellent coldy and make a nice light 
luncheon in a railway carriage^ 

The Atheriney or Sand-smeUj is often sold and passed 
off for the real smelt. It may be distinguished by the 
absence of the cucumber smell peculiar to the smelt, 
and by the handsome bright stripe running the whole 
length of its side. Considered in respect to its own proper 
merits, and not as an impostor, it is a delicate and 
wholesome little fish, lighter on the stomach than the 
smelt itself. It is dressed in the same way, forming what 
the French call afriture* and of which they are so ex- 
ceedingly fond. 

Fritures are also made, and enjoyed, of small 
bream, roach, dace, bleak, and other minor fresh-water 
fish, which deserve but little attention from the serious 
eater ; they are rather plagues to the kitchen-maid who 
has to clean them. The gudgeon, however, has the 
advantage of offering, in its bones, a packet of excellent 
picktooths for the end of a meal. 

* The word friture has a doable signification. At first it probably 
denoted only the fat or oil in which things are fried. Afterwards, the 
term was applied to the thing*, amongst which fried fish, being pre- 
eminently popular, appropriated the term to themselyes. 



220 FISH. 

A better fry of small fish (although not fresh-water) 
is aflfbrded by the Sand Eel, or Launce, of which there 
are two species ; one the Wide-moutliedj the larger, and 
much the rarer, of the two, attaining a length of as 
much as fifteen inches; the other, seldom exceeding 
seven or eight inches, but generally found half or one- 
third that length (which makes it all tlie more suitable 
fovfriture)^ is common enough along the sandy shoi'es of 
Great Britain and Ireland. They are prepared for frying 
by removing their heads and gills, drawing the intestines, 
drying, and flouring. If as carefully treated as white- 
bait, they will bear a comparison with it for richness and 
delicacy. 

Unfortunately, from their peculiar habit of burrowing 
in the sand at the water's edge, as well as fix)m their 
favom* with fishermen as bait, they do not often appear 
at market; but their capture is capital fun during a 
summer sea-side visit, and is all tlie more amusing that 
it requires two persons to effect it properly. So rapidly 
does the little fish bury itself again in the sand aft;er 
being disturbed, that it requires the utmost nimbleness 
to seize it before it disappears. On the sands of Porto- 
bello, near Edinburgh, when people have discovered 
that a shoal of sand eels have arrived, they sally forth, 
armed with spades, shovels, rakes, and forks, to dig them 
out When extricated fr'om their sandy beds, the fish 
leap about with singular agility, and afford much sport 
to the younger folk in capturing them. 

But helter-skelter work like that must, on account 
of its want of method, be comparatively unproductive. 



FISH. 221 

Althongli, with practice, yon may do something alone, 
you onglit, for this sport, to run in couples; one to 
unsand the eels, the other to bag them. 

An eye-witness describes this mode of proceeding 
— which has been proverbial from the days of Virgil 
downwards as emblematic of " labour in vain." It is 
not the attempt to wash a blackamoor white, but the ap- 
parently fruitless act of ploughing the sands of the shore. 

It is low water, and we are at the epoch of spring- 
tides, namely, a day or two after the ftdl or new moon. 
You see the strand is covered with furrows, like those 
in a ploughed field, only narrower ; and, as we advance 
to the water's edge, we catch half a dozen men and 
women in the profitable fact of ploughing the sandy beach. 

Look at that bright-eyed lass, with her golden drop- 
earrings and her neat-fitting cap, her legs encased in dark 
woollen stockings, and her feet sensibly shod with wooden 
shoes. Her petticoats are prudently short; a small 
canvas-bag is slung over her apron. Her hands grasp a 
garden tool, which in English vernacular is styled a hoe. 
With this firmly pressed on the level sand, she walks 
steadily backwards, ploughing tlie surface. As the wind 
and tide happen to be to-day, her labour will not turn 
out so unproductive as you might imagine ; and the crop 
will be gathered more rapidly than if it were forced by 
the best-advertised manures on tlie list of patents. I will 
tell you in confidence that that robust, good-looking girl is 
searching in this barren soil for the daintiest dish which 
appears on breakfast-tables hereabouts. 

We approach ; the plough moves steadily on. After

delicate, silveiy fish. On with the plough! More 
quick-writhing victims are upturned; the canvas bag 
bears a respectable burden. You wish to help her, do 
you, and to save her the trouble of picking up her game ? 
Be quick, then, in your motions, or you'll be sure to 
catch a blank. There I the fish is gone ; you liave lost 
it Where is it ? Deep in the sand by this time. No 
mole can burrow so rapidly and efiectually. And there 
is another ; you have contrived to secure iJiat before it 
has interred itself. And no wonder either I Its head — 
see I — ^has been amputated by the hoe. These creatures 
liave the curious habit of lying hid in the sand with their 
heads uppermost and their tails downwards. Like Ben 
Jonson in Westminster Abbey, they prefer to bo buried 
in a perpendicular position. Hence the number which 
are decapitated in the process of catching them, without, 
however, thereby losing their liveliness. Hold, maiden, 
enough ! The bag is lialf full. There are already more 
than we can cat at a meal. You will contruue, never- 
theless, to plough for sand-eels or launces ; they will be 
welcome as bait to the fishermen. 

PUce, The most life-respecting Brahmin that ever 
existed may feast on Pike, not only without scruple, but 
as a good work. He will be helping to destroy insatiable 
destroyers. The pike, from its cradle in the river's-bed 
to its grave in the fish-kettle, is a pitiless cannibal, 
without bowels of mercy, devouring its own children, its 
brothers and sisters, and, when possible, its grandfathers 



FISH. 223 

and grandmothers. When not more than a couple of 
inches long, it lurks in ambush behind a bit of water- 
weed or under a floating leaf, ready to snap up with its 
relentless jaws any living thing that is weaker than itself. 
Full-grown, it does not hesitate to seize swans by the 
neck and mules by the lips. Notwithstanding which 
unamiable ways, the pike is decidedly a goodfidu 

Every body has his anecdote of the pike's voracity; 
the Doctor, therefore, may be allowed to tell his. One 
day he saw in his fish-pond, flopping about on the 
surface of the water, a queer-looking nondescript, 
evidently a pike with a tail at each end and the head in 
the middle. By slipping a ladder into the pond and 
stepping along its staves, the double-tailed monster was 
taken by hand. It proved to be a couple of pike, of nearly 
the same size, which had closed together in mortal coil. 
But ilvai fact was nothing out of the common way. What 
was droll was, that it was the smaller of the two that had 
tried to swallow the larger, endeavouring to force within 
its greedy stomach something bigger than its own proper 
self. And so fierce had been the original gripe, that 
neither could the victim disengage his head from his 
captor's jaws, nor could the captor loose his hold 
of the victim's head. Things were thus at a stand- 
still — a complete dead lock ; which we speedily settled 
by giving each combatant a smart rap on the back of 
the neck. They were afterwards treated with perfect 
impartiality; stufled with the same stufiing, bound in 
the same circular attitude, and accompanied by the 
same sauce, they were served on the same dish side by 



224 FISH. 

side, and pronounced equally excellent in freshness and 
flavour. 

Pikej Fried Piecemeal. There is a prevalent idea and 
custom in districts where pike are most abundant that 
this fish must be served whole, of whatever size it may 
happen to be ; which often renders the cooking it incon^ 
venient, and the disposing of it cold next day embarrass- 
ing. The practice, although time-honoured, is inconsistent 
with common sense ; for no one would think of setting 
a ten or twelve pound cod, whole, before a small party or 
family. By what right or prescription, then, except a 
usage which may be well allowed to grow obsolete, can a 
ten or twelve pound pike claim to appear in its entirety? 

With the pike, as with many other fish, the male is 
long and taper, the female short and thick. The sexes 
may be known, almost at a glance, by tliis difierence in 
their bodily proportions. In consequence of her thick- 
set figure, the female will often deceive the eye in respect 
to Iter weiglvL It is prudent, therefore, to consult the 
scales. When a pike, after emptying, reaches ten or 
twelve potmds, unless wanted to set before a really large 
party, it may be conveniently and agreeably disposed of 
thus : Divide it into three pieces equal in weight ; boil 
the head and shoulders, bake or roast the middle, and 
fry the tail-part piecemeal. 

Scale this portion of the fish completely ; split it 
through down the backbone, which remove, as well as 
the ribs and fins. Then cut the flesh into squares or 
fillets of a size convenient to serve with your spoon or 
fish-slice without dividing them. If you have the time. 



FISH. 225 

let these pieces steep several hours — all night even — 
in salt and weak vinegar. When wanted, dry them well 
in a napkin, rub with flour, and fry to a nice light brown, 
immersed in boiling fat. Serve on a napkin garnished 
with parsley and witli quarters of lemon for each person 
to squeeze over his piece of fish. Or, if there bo no 
lemon at hand, oiled butter and vinegar may be sent up 
in a sauce-boat. This mode of dressing pike is both 
sightly and excellent. It is also good cold, with oil and 
vinegar.

moisten gradually with vinegar, and put the lid on close

the gravy in the stew-pan another boil up, stirring it well 
all the while ; then pour it over the fish, and serve.

string passed through the eje-holes, so as to bend the fish 
into the form of a circle. If there be any milt or roe, 
it may either be boiled plain and served in the centre of 
the circular fish, or be mixed up with the stuffing as one 
of its ingredients. Pike is a fish which requires thorough 
cooking, especially when stuffed. A five or six pounds 
fish will take about half an hour^s boiling. Serve on 
a napkin, garnish with parsley, and send up with 
anchovy sauce. 

Boiled head and shoulders, or middle, of pike, should 
be accompanied by forcemeat balls of the same stuffing 
as' above. 

Pike^ Baked Whole. Prepare, stufi^, and tie in a 
circle, exactly as above. Put it in a baking-dish with a 
little flour and water at the bottom, and lay lumps of 
butter along its back. Set it in the oven, and, when the 
butter is melted, baste the fish with its own gravy from 
time to time. When nearly done, add to the gravy a 
dessert-spoonful of capers and their vinegar, and a few 
olives. When quite done, dish the fish ; put the gravy 
into a saucepan, and finish it off by adding stock, if 
necessary, thickening and smoothing it with a dust of 
flour, and seasoning with pepper and salt Pour hot 
over the fish, and serve. 

Pike may also be thus baked at/uU lengthy if preferred, 
instead of being tied neck and heels. Baked middle of 
pike should either have stuffing in it, or be accompanied 
by forcemeat baHs. Pike can be baked either in the 
oven of a cooking-stove, or in an American oven before 
the fire. < A bread or baker's oven, which hardly allows of

middle of a very large pike maj be roasted as a joint 
before the fire.

in the yolks of the eggs, and then stir gently, little by

Carpj Tenchj Perchj and Eeh^ unless obtained from 
the clear waters of large lakes, like those of Scotland and 
Switzerland, will have the muddy taste which is apt to 
hang about them considerabljr diminished hj keeping 
them several days in a tank or cistern of clear spring- 
water which is continually changed. 

The Carp is highly glorified by continental epicures, 
much (the Doctor thinks) beyond its merits, for which 
it is greatly indebted to cooks. It is held to be a dish 
for princes, which would be dishonoured by being cooked 
otherwise than in a comrt-bouillon. The most esteemed 
are the so-called carp of the Hhine ; the majority of which 
have never been within a couple of miles of that mighty 
stream. Caught in the ponds of Lindre, dondrechanges, 
and others in German Lorraine, they are brought still 
young to Strasbourg, and are fattened in the river HI, 
confined in enormous feeding pools or pounds. There 
they attain considerable sizes, and used to be sold for 
fabulous prices, as much (it is recorded*) as thirty louis 
d'ors each. 

As to tlie sizes attained by carp, the fact is, that that 
fish (like its brilliant relation the gold-fish) thrives best in 
waters which reach a higher summer temperature than our 
own. With us, even, it prospers better in ponds whose cir- 
cumstances allow them to be well heated by the summer^s 
sun. As to value, although there is no accounting for 
taste and fitshion, it was no doubt heightened, in ante- 
railway times, by the carp's wonderful power of support-

want of a purchaser. It performed the journey in the 
courier^s trunk, and with no other sustenance than bread 
soaked in wine. Perhaps, he concludes, it may be living 
still. Let us hope so ; for there is no known limit to the 
natural life of a carp. The Doctor has seen carp, and 
those not large ones, which we)*e more than seventy years 
of age. They had been put into a small pond seventy 
years ago by the grandfather of their then proprietor; 
and they were known to be the same individuals, because 
every year they were taken out and kept in a tub while 
their pond was being cleaned. How old they were when 
first put in, nobody know. During those long seventy 
years they had grown scarcely at all, owing to the stunt- 
ing tendency of the cold chalybeate water in which they 
lived. When tlie Doctor saw them, there appeared no 
reason why they should not live seventy, or twice or 
thrice seventy, years longer. Surely no one would ever 
think of eating such venerable fish as these I 

The milts of carp are much sought after, and the 
tongue 18 one of the epicure's morsels. In whatever way 
a carp is to be dressed, it is improved by marinading, 
or pickling, some hours previously. Carp is reputed a 
light, wholesome aliment, agreeing with every constitu- 
tion, and which may be given to convalescents, especially 
when grilled. It is one of those fish whose dignify 
exacts carving, not with a spoon, but with a silver 
trowel.

Carp h la Venetienne ( Venetian way). Scale, empty^ 
and take oat the gills of a handsome cai*p. Wash it 
with a small glass of brandy ; pepper and salt it moder- 
ately inside and out ; deposit it in the fish-kettle on a bed 
of white onions sliced very thin, and all sorts of sweet 
herbs at command. Stew it, with the lid close, a good 
quarter of an hour ; then add to it a pint of common 
white wine, a tumbler of water, two pounded anchovies^ 
and a lump of butter rubbed in flour. Stew all together 
gently. When the fish is enough cooked, reduce the 

■ 

sauce to a proper consistence, strain it, and pour it hot 
over the fish on your dish. 

Carpy Fried, Select a carp with a soft roe or milt ; 
scale and empty without opening it Slit it down the 
back, leaving the head hanging on by nothing but the 
belly part Flatten the backbone ; dust your fish well with 
flour, as also the milt which you have set apart Put the 
whole into plenty of hot fat ; fry to a nice bright colour, 
and serve garnished with quartered lemons. 

Marinade of Caiy^ or atlwr frefih'-WQier Fish. Cut your 
carp across into thick sUces or steaks ; put them into a 
stew-pan with salt, pepper, grated nutmeg, a few cloves, 
a few slices of onion, some sweet basil, and the jjuice of 
a lemon, or, in default thereof, a dash of vinegar. Stir 
up all well together, to make the pickle penetrate and 
communicate its flavour. An hour before serving, drain 
and dry your slices of carp ; then dust them with flour,, 
fry to a bright brown, and serve garnished with fried 
parsley. 

Or the pieces may be egged and bread-crumbed, or 



FISH. 231 

dipped in batter, before fiying; but in either of those 
cases, the fish ought first to be three-parts cooked in the 
marinade. 

Tench, eels, pike, trout, barbel, and other river fish, 
may be dressed in the same way. When not too large, 
they can be firied whole, if preferred. 

Broiled Carp. When your fish is scaled, emptied, 
and wiped thoroughly dry, smear it with a little oil, and 
lay it on the gridiron. When done, you may serve it 
either on a bed of sorrel, or with caper sauce, or with 
a maitre-d'hdtel sauce, or simply with oil and vinegar. 
Either way, it is light and digestible. 

Stuffed Carp. Chop fine some button mushrdoms, 
together with parsley, chives, and a couple of small 
onions ; toss them in a saucepan over a brisk fire with a 
little butter. If the carp has any roe, it should be mixed 
up with the above. Take it off the fire, and mix there- 
with minced hard egg-yolks, chopped anchovy, pepper 
and salt 

Scale and empiy your carp, and split it open along 
the belly; put your stufiing in, and sew it up again. 
Oil a sheet of paper, wrap your carp in it, and lay it on 
the gridiron over a moderate fire. When thoroughly 
done, remove the paper, and serve the carp on a hot oval 
dish, with a good lump of butter well worked up witli 
minced parsley, pepper, salt, and lemon-juice. 

Stewed Carp. Scale and empty your carp, and cut 
it across into steaks. Make a brown roux with butter 
and flour ; brown in it a few small onions ; add sprigs of 
thyme and parsley, a bay-leaf, a clove of garlic, grated 



232 FX8H. 

nutmeg, and a few button mushrooms; moisten with 
half broth and half red wine. 

Into this liquor put your carp, and let it boil brisklj. 
When thoroughly done, lay slices of toasted bread at the 
bottom of your dish ; on them hiy the carp, and pour the 
sauce over it 

Carp a la Chambord. A troublesome and expensive 
mode in which large fresh-water fish, of various kinds, are 
occasionally dressed by foreign cooks, but which really 
is more for show than satisfaction. The reader, however, 
ought to know what is meant by fish a la Cfuztnbord; he 
can then exercise his own discretion in ordering his 
" G(*)d Plain" to execute it on any fine specimen that 
may fall into his hands. 

Scale and empty your carp. You may stuff it or not 
with any stufiing that suits your fancy, sewing up the 
belly afterwards. Lard, or rather 2^rick* one side of it 
with small strips of bacon ; or you may prick it, in stripes 
across, with threads of bacon, covering the parts not 
pricked with slices of bacon, so as to give it the appear- 
ance of a cross between a zebra and a hedgehog. Lay 
the carp in a deep dish that will stand the oven. Pour 
into the dish just enough high-seasoned court-bouillon, 
or marinade, to leave the larded portion of the fish 
uncovered. Put it into the oven, and bake, basting 
frequently. When done, remove the slices of bacon, and 

* In strict culinary language, piquery to prick, is to lard, with a 
larding-pin, the surface of veal, fowls, &c. To lard, is to introduce 
square strips of bacon through meat, so that when cut across it has a 
slight resemblance to a chess-board. The learner must see the thing 
done. 



FISH. 233 

glaze (with stock redaced) the parts thej had covered ; 
leave the pricks of bacon, which shoald be of a delicate 
brown. Transfer the fish carefally, and without breaking 
it, to the dish on which it is to appear. 

Garnish the fish round with a medley of any thing 
your imagination or your resources can get together. 
Perfectly orthodox items are — ^fried bread, artichoke- 
bottoms, crawfish, cocks'-combs, bits of sweetbread (white 
or brown, pricked with bacon or not), mushrooms, 
truffles, squabs or young pigeons, forcemeat balls, que- 
nellesj and — ^what not else ? 

Mix together the marinade in which the fish was 
baked, with enough Spanish sauce to make it sufficiently 
thick ; boil up, pour it over all, and servo. 

The queneUes just mentioned are notliing more than 
true forcemeat balls, about the size and shape of a hen's 
egg, moulded between a couple of tablespoons. Their 
ingredients may be the flesh of butchers' meat, fowl, 
or game, minced or pounded very fine, seasoned with 
herbs, salt, and spices, enriched witli chopped veal suet, 
and bound together by raw egg. Or, for meager dishes, 
quenelles may be composed of chopped cold fish, butter, 
bread-crumbs soaked in milk, with herbs and seasoning 
to taste. 

When moulded or rolled into shape, the quenelles 
are thrown into boiling salt-and-water, and galloped for 
a quarter of an hour. " Some people," says Ude, 
^^ poach the quenelles in broth. In my opinion, it is 
spoiling the broth." He is right; because, whether 
water be used or the richest soup, it should enter the 



234 FISH. 

substance of quenelles as little as possible. In fact, they 
are a sort of composite dumpling, and the Doctor would 
suggest the rolling them in flour and steaming them; 
the only objection to which is, that they would not be 
exactly round or «gg-shaped, but have an under-side at 
the part where they touched the steamer. 

Quenelles, afler a partial poaching, may be drained, 
dried, dipped into batter, and fried. But the pan must 
be deep, and the fat hot and in plenty ; otherwise the 
quenelles will come out lumps of sponge saturated with 
grease. 

Fried quenelles are often served as a dish by them* 
selves, instead of, or in company with, little patties, &c, 
as an entr& between the fish and the joint tliat follows it. 

It is needless to enter with greater precision into the 
composition of quenelles (although one or two special 
kinds will be given in their places), because no two cooks 
of eminence make them exactly alike. Each die/ gives 
some finishing touch of his own, which he believes himself 
entitled to patent. Others, again, swell their materials 
with such vulgar ingredients as cow's udder and calfs 
pluck. 

Small Carpy Tenchj or Perchy Fried^ are sometimes 
employed to form an attendant circle round any large 
fresh-water fish (either boiled, stewed, or au bleu) when 
served whole. They thus make a tasty accompaniment^ 
in every sense of the word; and are much less incon- 
gruous than the costly odds and ends which we have 
seen it is the rule to heap round fish a la Chanibord, 

The Tench is one of many instances of the difierent 



nsH. 235 

way in which the same thing is appreciated in different 
countries. On the Continent, its kitchen-rank is far 
inferior to that of its consin-germain the carp ; whUe 
here, we may venture to say, it is preferred by judges 
who are well acquainted with both. The meat of the 
tench is light, delicate, and nutritious. The highly 
gelatinous nature of its skin gives a richness, without 
oiliness, to dishes into which it enters (as a matelote) 
superior to that communicated by any other fresh-water 
fish, not even excepting the eeL The great objection 
made to the tench is, that it is apt to taste of the muddy 
waters, which are, indeed, its natural haunts. The fault 
may be remedied in a great measure, if not entirely^ 
by allowing the fish to cleanse themselves in a basin fed 
by a running stream; and if half the pains were bestowed 
on the tench that are considered indispensable with the 
carp, a slight flavour of alluvial waters would be rendered 
imperceptible. 

Tenchj Flain'-Boiled. Scale the fish veiy carefully,, 
and empty by slitting open the belly. Let them lie for 
several hours, or all night, in a mixture of salt and weak 
vinegar. The scales, which are small and deep-set, will 
be got rid of more easily by plunging the fish a minute 
in boiling water, and tlien scraping off the scales. The 
same method may be practised with Perch, which are 
also difficult to scale. 

Set your fish-kettle on the fire with a little more cold 
water in it than will suffice to completely cover the fish. 
Throw into this a wineglass of vinegar. If you intend 
making use of the boilings for sauce or fish jeUy, do not 



236 FISH. 

add any salt When it boils, throw in your fish. From 
ten minutes to a quarter of an hour will be enough for 
fish of fi-om one to two pounds weight. About ten 
minutes will sufiiee for smaller fish, boiling briskly. 
Serve garnished with sprigs of parsley, and accompanied 
by anchovy sauce, weak of the anchovy, and which may 
be made with the boilings of the fish instead of water. 
This dish, fianked by mashed potatoes, may be advan- 
tageously set before convalescents. 

Tenchy Stewed^ Prepare and pickle the fish as above. 
Set it on the fire, in a mixture just enough to cover it 
of half good veal broth and half red wine, cold, with a 
few peppercorns, the rind of half a lemon, and a sprig of 
parsley and sweet marjoram. When the boiling-point is 
reached, let it simmer slowly, takuig care the fish do not 
break. When done, transfer it to an oval dish ; garnish 
it round with alternate bits of toasted broadband slices of 
lemon. 

Remove the bouquet and lemon-peel fi'om the gravy. 
Thicken it with a bit of butter worked in flour ; season 
to taste with salt, or with a teaspoonful of anchovy sauce 
and tlie juice of half a lemon ; boil up, and pour over the 
fish. 

Tenchy Coldy in Jelly. For your mould, take an 
ordinary pie-dish, more than deep enough for yom* tench 
to lie in. Make a clear savoury jelly with either pigs* 
feet or a calf's foot With this, fill the bottom of your 
dish to the depth of an inch or so. Set it aside to cool 
and stifien. 

Stew your tench exactly as above. When done, 



FISH. 237 

take it out to oool ; when cold^ laj it in the pie-dish^ on 
the bed of cold savoury jelly. 

Boil down the gravy in which the tench was stewed 
till it forms a stiff jelly when cold. Let it cool ; then 
break it up into lumps, not too small, and distribute 
them around and over the cold tench lying in its dish. 

Warm up the rest of your clear jelly just to the point 
of liquefaction ; pour it over the tench till fairly covered. 
Set aside to stiffen all night in the coldest place (short of 
freezing) you have. 

Next day, when wanted, turn it out on a dish with 
the help of a hot cloth applied for a moment to the under 
parts of the pie-dish. Nicely managed, this makes a 
welcome addition either to a luncheon or a sit-down 
supper. 

Tench^ Fried. Clean and prepare as above. An 
hour before they are wanted, dry them well in a napkin, 
dust with flour, and fry plunged in boiling fat. Serve 
on a napkin, garnished with fried parsley. Delicate 
anchovy sauce may be offered with them. 

The tench may be cooked in any of the ways indicated 
for the carp. As he not rarely attains respectable pro- 
portions, he is perfectly presentable under the same 
conditions. A large tench, or a brace of fine ones, 
stewed, really make a handsome dish. 

Tench a la Foulette (Swiss). Scale and clean your 
fish, opening their bellies. Cut them across into pieces 
or steaks, which throw into boiling salt-and-water ; let 
them boil briskly three or four minutes ; take out, drain, 
and set aside to cool. If convenient, and a help to the 



238 FISH, 

cook in getting forward, they can be prepared up to this 
point the day before, or daring the morning of the dinner. 

Put a lump of butter into a stew-pan ; give your tench- 
steaks a toss or two in this, till they begin to show colour. 
Add a little flour, and dilute gradually with white wine 
and water; throw in a bouquet complete, and a few 
mushrooms. 

When the fish is done, arrange it on its dish ; remove 
the bouquet ; reduce the sauce by boiling it a minute or 
two longer; finish it off with a dash of vinegar, thicken- 
ing with yolk of egg, and pour it, witli the mushrooms, 
over the fish. 

Tench^ with Sweet Herbs. After cleaning as before, 
marinade them in oil, with chopped parsley, chives, 
shallots, thyme, bay-leaf, pepper and salt Aft»r re- 
maining there several hours, wrap them with their 
marinade in a sheet of oiled or buttered paper; lay 
them on the gridiron, and broil. When done, turn them 
out of the paper upon a hot dish. 

Respecting Perchy most people are agreed that it is 
excellent ; taken fi-om tlie waters of clear, deep lakes, it 
may even be pronounced an exquisite fish. For invalids 
it is especially rccommendable. Without ever becoming 
a monster or a show, it is often to be had of satisfactory 
size. The best modes of dressing it are : 

Perchy Plain^BoUed. Clean, prepare, and proceed 
exactly as with tench. 

Perchy Pried, Idem, ditto, the same. 

Perch in Court-Bouillon, Treat like carp and pike ; 
but they must be large specimens for this. 



FISH. 239 

Perchj with Sweet Herbs. Scale (which is a trouble- 
some operation with perchj rendering the fishmonger's 
assistance acceptable) and empty them. Marinade them, 
several hours in a mixture of olive-oil^ parsley, pepper, 
salt, and sweet herbs minced very fine. When wanted, 
smear them with egg, and sprinkle them well with a 
mixture of grated crumb of stale bread, and fine-minced 
sweet herbs. Broil them over a gentle fire until thoroughly 
done and nicely yellow-browned on both sides. If any 
sauce is served with them, it should be of the simplest, 
as a little lemon-juice, or oiled butter with a dash of 
vinegar. 

Perch in Wine. Handsome-sized fish are required 
for this. Scale, clean, and open them ; put them in a 
stew-pan with half white wine, half good broth, bay-leaf, 
clove of garlic, bunch of parsley and chives, three or four 
cloves, and a little salt. When cooked, take up the fish, 
strain the liquor, thicken it with butter worked with 
flour, stirring continually until well incorporated. Season 
with pepper, grated nutmeg, and a few drops of essence 
of anchovy, and pour it hot over your perch. 

The famous Perch a la " Waster-fish^'' or " Waiter- 

fiichy' is the same as the above, with slight alterations 

according to the caprice of cooks : such as sticking the 

red fins into the side of the fish, to show what fish it 

is. 

Perch and pike are to be had in great perfection in 
the mountainous regions of the United Kingdom ; where, 
however, they are thrown into the shade by the over- 
powering magnificence of the lordly salmon. Notwith- 



240 FISH. 

standing wbioh^ thej can be eaten oftener^ digested more 
easily, and procured during a longer period of the year, 
. than their aristocratic rival. 

The Eel, so uglj during life, is an almost universal 
favourite afler death. A little heavy, although nutri- 
tious, few fish have greater power to tempt people to 
commit gastronomic imprudences. Humble in its birth, 
plebeian in its manners, fond of retirement, nay, hating 
the light, its modesty is rewarded by admission to the 
wealthiest tables; where, however, it rarely appears 
whole, not even disguised a la Tartare — the finest way 
of dressing the finest eels. Nevertheless, if quite gigantic 
in stature, it might be roasted on a spit, enveloped in 
oiled paper, and served in a lake of some learned sauce. 
But it is only in the quality of " Monster" that it could 
expect to be paid so high an honour. Ordinarily, it 
resigns itself to be eaten fried, spitehcocked, stewed, or 
collared. It is frequently called upon to play its part in 
gamishings, of which it is the brightest ornament, re- 
ceiving there due admiration in recompense for its extreme 
humility. As to the skinning (which Ude improved by 
throwing the creature into the fire, alive), it has got 
used to it by this time, regarding it as an old-established 
ceremony; nay, more, as an 'indispensable matter of 
course. An eel, however, may be easily stunned by 
grasping it by the middle with a coarse woollen clotli, 
or with a hand previously rubbed with dry sand, and 
then knocking the back of its head against a stone or 
other hard substance. If, while stunned, it is cleverly 
decapitated and skinned, there is little probability that 



FISH. 241 

it retains much consciousness of what is passing around 
it afterwards. 

EeU a la Tartartj A. Take a couple of middle- 
sized eels ; skin and clean them ; cut off the heads and 
the thinnest part of the tail-ends; score or * crimp the 
fish at equal distances along their lengthy as if you were 
going to joint an ox-tail. Powder the slashes in the eels 
with parsley and chives minced very fine. Tie the eels 
together in such a way, that between them they shall 
form a ring or circle, resembling the emblem of eternity. 

Put a lump of butter into a stew-pan, with carrots 
and onions sliced, parsley, and bay-leaf. After they 
have had a turn or two in the heated butter, add salt 
and peppercorns, and dilute with white wine and water. 
When this liquor is cooked enough, strain it, and then 
put your circle of eel to boil in it When half done, 
take it out and let it cool. 

When cold, wet it with your sauce, and dust it with 
bread-crumbs. Smear it again with beat-up egg, sea- 
soned with pepper and salt, and sprinkle more bread- 
crumbs over it. Then broil it on a gridiron over a 
gentle fire. When done, put it on a hot dish, and pour 
Tartar Sauce (p. 126) into the middle of the circle. 

N.B. This receipt may be simplified by merely broil- 
ing the circle of eel, without any previous caoking either 
in sauce or in plain salt-and-water. But unless the eels 
are quite undersized, it is more prudent to parboil them 
in some liquid, to insure their being thoroughly done. 
Besides, it affords the groat advantage of their being 
advanced a step in case of press of time.

Eels a la Tartare — Tartar Eeh^ B. Skin your eels, 
cut them into lengths of about two inches, and boil 
them in savoury gravy or broth which has wine in it, 
with a little sali When cold, take them out; let drain; 
dip them in a mixture of oiled butter and uncooked egg- 
yolk ; roll them in crumbs of bread till they are well and 
equally covered with them ; lay them on a gridiron, till 
they are well heated throughout and nicely browned 
outside. Serve on a layer of Tartar Sauce at the bottom 
of the dish. 

Stewed Eels. For this, fine eels are best, and also 
those procured from brackish waters, — as the mouths of 
rivers, open harbours, &c. Cut the eels, when skinned, 
into lengths of two or three inches. Steep tliem for a 
while in salt and vinegar. In your stew-pan make a 
roux with butter and Hour, and broAvn in it a few slices 
of onion. Dilute with good broth and wine until you 
have enough liquid to cover your eels. 

Put them in, with whole pepper, bouquet of herbs, 
salt, and a bit of lemon-peel, and two or three cloves. 
Stew gently, till the pieces of eel are quite done, without 
£dling to pieces. 

Arrange the pieces of eel in your dish. Bemove the- 
bouquet and lemon-peel from the gravy ; add to it the 
juice of half a lemon ; taste whether it requires furtlier 
seasoning ; boil up, and pour hot over the eel. 

This dish, moderately partaken of, is both wholesomo 
and restorative. It is also very palatable cold. When 
prepared with that intention, it will bear more seasoning 
than if intended to be consumed hot; and the quantity 



FISH. 243 

of lemon-juioe may be increased or replaced by a smaU 
wineglassfiil of vinegar. 

Uel a ritaltenne. Take a large eel, skinned ; cut it 
into pieces three inches long. Boil them in white wine 
and water. 

Pat into a saaoepan a good lump of butter, with 
shallots and mushrooms minced very fine, and seasoned 
with salt and peppercorns. When it begins to heat, add 
two spoonfuls of good stock or gravy, and the liquor in 
which the eel was boiled. When this sauce is sufficiently 
reduced, arrange the pieces of eel on a dish, and pour it 
over them boiling hot. 

The flesh of eels being oily and viscous, they should 
be thoroughly cooked, and rather highly seasoned (in 
whatever way they are dressed), to prevent their causing 
indigestion.

Empty it at the orifice of the gills, and suppress the head* 

Then prick it along the back with long, thin strips of 
bacon. Boll or twist it in such a way that these quills 
of bacon stand outside and uppermost, fixing it in the

Then bake it in the oven. 

Put into a stew-pan a lump of good butter, slices of

pepper, salt, and mixed spices. When the carrots and 
onions are browned, moisten with broth and white wine.

boil an hour, strain, heat up again, and pour it over 
the eel. 

You maj send up with it either Tartar or Tomato 
Sauce. 

Spitchcocked Eelsy A. Skin and split them down 
the back, take out the bone, and cut them into pieces 
three inches long. Egg them, and dip them in a 
mixture of bread-crumbs, minced sweet herbs, and 
ground white pepper. Broil them over a charcoal or 
verj clear cinder fire. Serve with lemon, to squeeze 
over them. 

Spitchcocked EeU^ B, Leave the skin on; merelj 
open the bcUj without splitting the fish, cut it into short 
lengths, which boil in salt-and-water till three-qitarters 
done ; then finish them off on the gridiron with bread- 
crumbs, &c, as above; or, if more convenient, they can 
be browned in a Dutch or American oven. Anchovy 
sauce may be sent up with them. 

It is the right thing to leave the skin on spitch- 
cocked eels, but its oiliness renders them more indiges- 
tible. The parboiling in part removes the objection, 
besides insuring the eels being done thoroughly and 
tender. 

Eels a la Poulette. Cut the eels into short lengths, 
and stew them in a marinade of salt, vinegar and water, 
and pepper, setting it on the fire cold, and not more 
than wiU cover them. 

Make a white roux; moisten with veal broth or 
consomm^; throw in some parsley and onions, both 
chopped fine ; boil twenty minutes ; then add the juice

of a lemon and some button mushrooms ; stir in as much 
of the marinade in which the eels were boiled as will 
bring it to a proper consistence, thickening if required 
with egg-jolk ; arrange the pieces of eel in jour dish, 
and pour the poulette sauce over them.

with pepper and salt, and roll it in flour. Then arrange 
the eels in the pie-dish. You maj intersperse them 
with button mushrooms, hard eggs in quarters, cocks'- 
combs, forcemeat balls, dice of half-cooked calf s head 
or veal, or other garnishing ; or jou maj laj slices of 
thin veal at the bottom of the dish. Sprinkle over them 
the juice of a lemon and a tablespoonful of mushroom 
ketchup, and then pour in a cupful or two of good veal 
broth. Cover the whole with a paste proportioned in 
thickness and lightness to the time jou reckon (from 
their size) the eels will take to cook thoroughlj without 
being overdone. Bake in a moderate (not a slow) 
oven. 

Eel pie is mostlj eaten cold, and is useful for lunch* 
eons, picnics, &c. 

Eel Patties. Cook inch-lengths of eel hla poulette. 



246 FISH. 

When done, with a knife and fork remove the back- 
bone, so that each piece remains in halves ; which will 
leave the morsels of eel-meat quite large enough, besides 
the advantage of being boned. 

When the puff-crust of your patties is ready (see 
Vol-au-Vent), heat up your fish ragoiit, and with it fill 
the patties, putting into each a fair proportion of flesh 
and gravy. 

The flavour of the ragoM may be varied by a dash 
of mushroom ketchup, or Soy, or Harvey's or anchovy 
sauce; so that it will be perfectly easy to send up at 
once eel patties of three or four different flavours and 
colouring of their ragodt.

Collared Eel (p. 85). 

The Sturgeon^ like the salmon, is a denizen of the 
seas, who, by ascending rivers, courts for himself the 
dangerous pleasures of human intercourse. He is an 
insipid, dry, firm, white-fleshed fish, who is called 
'^ royal" on account of his rarity. We should guess him 
to be indigestible, but his price mostly precludes the 
experiment A nice cut of sturgeon is considered a fine 
thing to produce on Good Friday or other grand fish- 
day; not that his appearance in the world is at all 
restricted to times of humiliation and fisisting. 

It is curious how strangely things hang together in 
that marvellous storehouse, the human memory. The 
word " sturgeon" conjures up, with the Doctor, a whole 
train of recollections. Once upon a night, he was 
present at a ball given by the Torlonias, Ducal Bankers, 



FISH. 247 

in their palace, at Borne. There was a supper, at which 
the dish of honour was small sturgeon floating in pairs 
in a mass of clear jelly. The Doctor did not taste 
sturgeon there. As nobody carved them, he did not 
presume to do so ; which may be one reason for his re- 
membering them so well. But the word sturgeon brings 
the whole scene back, — ^the marble staircase, lined with 
guards; the antichamber, where cardinals sat playing 
cards (etiquette preventing their penetrating further into 
the vanities of this wicked world) ; the glittering gallery, 
which served for the ball-room ; and, contrasted to it, 
the quiet boudoir in which you could read the Timesy or 
take a nap— with multitudes of other things, which must 
not make us forget our Kitchen. 

Boast Sturgeon. Marinade for several hours a good 
piece of sturgeon, after careful cleaning. Roast it on a 
spit, basting well with a lump of butter put into the latch- 
pan with a little of the marinade. Serve with any kind 
of piquant or other sauce. Boast Sturgeon may have 
the bone removed, and then be stuffed with veal stuffing. 

Sturgeon^ Economical^ or rather say Smuggled Stur^ 
fjeovu Take a piece of sturgeon, about two pounds in 
weight, and, on sending a piece of meat to the baker^s 
on a stand in a dish, put the sturgeon under it, with a 
little water, salt, pepper, &c. ; a little chopped shallot 
may be used ; you can also put potatoes round it Peas, 
if in season, are a good accompaniment, with melted 
butter. — Alexis Soger. 

Sturgeon a la Provenfole. The Proven9als hold 
sturgeon to be a well-flavoured fish ; but he must be

young and tender to be easy of digestion. Weak and 
convalescent stomachs are therefore wise in eschewing 
him done this way. 

Cut a slice of sturgeon three or four inches thick ; 
lard it throughout its thickness with strips of eel, or 
bacon, or both. Brown it in butter in a saucepan, with 
parsley and sweet herbs chopped fine, a clove of garlic, 
pepper and salt. Cover it with two or three bay-leaves, 
and cook it slowly over a gentle fire of hot ashes, with 
the lid well closed. 

The Turbot has been honoured with several flattering 
epithets, such as the Pontifical Fish, the Pheasant of 
the Sea, the King of Lent. No terms of admiration can 
exceed its merits, for it is as delicious as handsome, and 
as wholesome as delicious. It, and soles, are probably 
the fish of which it takes the longest to tire. 

There is really only one English way of dressing 
turbot, namely, plain boiling in salt-and-water ; on the 
Continent, they generally use court-bouillon, as more 
worthy of its dignity. But however dressed, the noble 
fish must appear (the first time) in all his majestic 
amplitude. Divided, cooked in portions, he ceases to do 
honour to a well-served table. He must rigorously be 
presented whole. Surrounded by a bright-green belt of 
parsley, accompanied by a tureen of melted butter, and 
carved with a golden trowel (or at least silver-gilt), he 
acknowledges no fishy superior. 

One of Brillat Savarin^s best stories relates to the 
duty of serving Turbot entire. 

Discord, he tells us, one day tried to intrude himself 



FISH. 249 

into one of the most united households in the French 
capital. It happened on a Saturday, the Jewish Sabbath ; 
the subject was the cooking of a turbot ; the scene, a 
country house ; and the site of the country house, Yille- 
crdne. 

This fish, said to have been kidnapped from a more 
glorious destiny, was to be served next day at a meeting 
of worthy people, of whom I (B. S.) was one. It was 
as fresh, fat, and bright-complexioned as the most 
fastidious epicure could wish; but its dimensions so 
completely exceeded every disposable utensil that nobody 
knew what to do with it. 

" Very well, then ; we must cut it in halves," said 
the husband* 

" Would you really have the heart to offer such an 
insult to the unoffending creature?" rejoined the wife. 

" What must be, must, my love, since there is no 
possibility of managing it otherwise. Come, somebody 
bring me the cleaver ; the operation won't take long." 

" Wait a while, mj dear; we have pleniy of time 
before us. Besides, you know, our cousin is coming ; 
he's a perfect Professor of Cookery, and he'll be sure to 
help us out of the difficulty." 

" He a Professor I he get us out of the difficuliy ! 
Fiddlededce I" 

An accurate report assures us that the speaker had 
no great confidence in the Professor; and yet the 
Professor was — me I A pretty notion ! 

The matter was on the point of being settled as 
Alexander managed the Gordian knot, when I arrived

exactly at the nick of time, sniffing the wind, with the 
appetite consequent on travelling when it is seven in 
the evening, and when the fragrance of a good dinner 
salates the smell and solicits the taste. 

On entering, I in vain attempted to paj the usual 
compliments ; my friends did not answer, because they 
did not hear me. The question which absorbed their 
whole attention was soon explained nearly in a duett ; 
after which, both the parties held their peace, as if by 
colnmon consent; tlie lady looking at me with eyes 
which seemed to say, ^^ I expect he'll get us out of the 
mess !" the gentleman, on the contrary, tossing his head 
contemptuously, in the certainty that I could be of no 
assistance, while his hand still clutched the terrible cleaver 
which had been brought to him at his request These 
opposite shades of feeling disappeared, to give place to 
marks of intense curiosity, when, with a grave and ora- 
cular voice, I pronounced the solemn words, " Theturbot 
slvall be left whole until its official presentation." 

I was sure of not compromising myself, because it 
struck me that I might have it cooked in the oven ; but 
as that method presented several difficulties, I did not 
yet explain my scheme, but proceeded in silence to the 
kitchen; I opening the procession as high-priest, the 
married couple serving for acolytes, the family repre- 
senting the body of the faithful, and the cook in full figg 
bringing up the rear. 

The two first offices we inspected presented nothing 
favourable to my views; but, on searching the wash- 
house, a copper which, though small, was most con- 



FISH, 25X 

veniently fixed over its fireplace, at once suggested the 
use I could make of it Turning to mj suite, I said, 
with that accent of faith which removes mountains, 
<^ Make your minds easy ; calm your spirits. The 
turbot shall be cooked whole. It shall be cooked by 
steam, and that directly.'* 

In fact, although it was quite time to dine, I imme- 
diately set every body to work. While some of them 
were lighting the copper-fire, I cut out of a fifty-bottle 
hamper a hurdle of precisely the same dimensions as the 
giant fish. On this hurdle I made them lay a stratum 
of highly flavoured bulbs and herbs, on which our marine 
colossus was extended, after being well washed, dried, 
and salted. A second layer of the same seasoning was 
spread over his back. We then placed the hurdle, with 
its precious burden, over the copper half full of water, 
covering the whole with an inverted wash-tub, round 
which we heaped a quantity of dry sand to prevent the 
steam from escaping too easUy. The copper soon began 
to boil ; the steam filled tlie whole capacity of the tub ; 
which being removed at the end of half an hour, the 
hurdle was taken from the top of^the copper, with the 
turbot cooked to a nicety, as white as milk, ai^d of the 
most amiable aspect. 

The operation complete, we rushed to table with 
appetites sharpened by delay, labour, and success ; so 
that it took Us a considerable space of time to reach the 
happy moment indicated by Homer when the abundance 
and variety of meats has at length put hunger to the 
chase. 



252 FISH. 

Next day, at dinner, the turbot was submitted to the 
judgment of its honourable consumers; its good looks 
drew forth exclamations of delight. Then the master of 
the house related with liis own lips the unhoped-for 
manner in which it had been cooked ; and I was praised 
not only for the readiness of the invention, but still more 
for its results ; for, after conscientious degustation, it was 
unanimously resolved that the fish, prepared in this way, 
was incomparably better than if it had been boiled in an 
ordinary turbot-kettie.* 

This verdict took nobody by surprise ; because, never 
having been immersed in boiling water, it had lost none 
of its principles, while, on the other hand, it had im- 
bibed all the aroma of the seasoning. 

While my ears were being filled to repletion with the 
compliments showered upon me in all directions, my 
eyes sought still more sincere tokens of approval by in- 
specting the countenance of each of the guests. I re- 
marked, with secret satisfaction, that General Labassee 
was so delighted that he smiled at every morsel that 
entered his mouth ; that the Cure held his neck stretched 
out and his eyes fixed on the ceiling in sign of ecstasy; 
and that of two Academicians, 2A gourmand as clever, who 
were present, the first, M. Auger, had as sparkling eyes 
and as radiant a countenance as an author whose play 
tlie public are applauding ; while the second, M. Yille-

main, held hLs head on one side, with his ohin directed 
towards the west, in the attitude of a person who is 
listening attentively. 

All which is good to remember ; because there are 
few countiy houses in which jou cannot find the re- 
quisites for improvising the apparatus which I employed 
on this occasion, and to which recourse can always be had 
whenever there is occajsion to cook any thing arriving 
unexpectedly, and exceeding the ordinary dimensions of 
its kind. Nevertheless, I should not have troubled my 
readers with the history of this mighty adventure, unless 
I had thought it applicable to purposes of general utility. 

Turbotj Plain'Boiled. It is a question of taste whe- 
ther to cook it immediately it comes out of the water, 
or to keep it a couple of days, salting it at least one 
night. Most people prefer it in the latter condition; 
the flesh is firmer, and it has acquired more flavour. On 
the other hand, the sooner it is cooked after taking leave 
of the sea, the lighter and more digestible it is. 

Put your turbot in a fish-kettle three-quarters full of 
cold water, into which you have thrown a handful of salt. 
While boiling up, remove the scum as fast as it rises* 
As soon as it really boils, draw the kettle partially off the 
fire, allowing it only to simmer gently. The size of the 
fish must regulate the time it should remain in the 
water after boiling. A moderate-sized turbot will be 
done in from thirty to forty minutes ; a small one in 
twenty: while it must be a very large turbot indeed 
which takes a whole hour to cook. 

Qive a final careful skimming before lifting the fish 



254 FISH. 

on its strainer out of the water. Let it drain a few 
minntes over the kettle; have ready the dish with a 
napkin on it, and adroitly let the fish slide on to its snowy 
bed. Of course, the fish will have been laid on the 
strainer with the side uppermost which is wished to be so 
when served. 

And here arises a knotty question of taste, custom, 
and comparative anatomy. Which is the proper side to 
dish uppermost of Turbot and its poor relation Brill ? 
For the two sides of real flat-fish are by no means alike, 
or even similar. With us, the white side is presented to 
view, as a rule that has come down to us from time 
immemorial. But the Doctor has heard it stoutly 
maintained, and seen it carried out in practice, that the 
hrovm side ought to lie uppermost, so retaining the fish's 
natural position at the bottom of the sea. 

The conformation of Plat-Fish is very curious* 
Cuvier says that this particular group is one of the most 
peculiar in the whole series of vertebrated animals. They 
are called Pleuronectidse, firom two Greek words which 
signify that they swim upon their sidesy which they really 
do; so much so, that, but for a wonderful adaptation of 
structure, they would have one eye buried in the mud or 
sand whenever they lurk at the bottom of the sea, as is 
their habitual woni To obviate this inconvenience^ 
their spine is distorted, taking, near the head, a sudden 
twist on one side, which causes both the eyes to look 
upwards. This distortion is made manifest to the most 
careless observer by the form and position of the mouth, 
the inequality of the two sides of the head,* and by the 






FISH. 255 

eyes being placed one higher than the other, and often 
unequal in size. Soles are caught, not so very rarely, 
which have what ought to be the white side either par- 
tially or entirely brown ; as if reverting to some ancestral 
type of thin-bodied fish^ wliich had not then learned to 
swim on its side. 

Flat-Fish, although they love to lie at the bottom, 
covering their whole person (except their eyes and 
mouth) with sand, can dart through the water with ex- 
traordinary swiftness, cutting through it like a knife. 
These motions, as well as more leisurely paddlings 
about, are performed by the muscles, not of their back, 
but of their upper sidey which, consequently, acquire 
fuller development by the exercise. The brown side of 
a turbot or briU is considerably thicker than the white 
side; there is more meat on it; it presents a larger 
number of cuts; and therefore, say the Browneans, it 
should be first presented to the carver, as offering to 
him fuller resources. Those who prefer the white side^ 
to eat the skin and the fin, can wait, or ask for it. 

True, the white side is pleasing in its creamy purity^ 
but the brown one contrasts well with the napkin on 
which it takes its final repose, and it removes all tempta- 
tion to decorate it with dabs of cayenne pepper, in imi- 
tation of the spots of the vulgar plaice — which dabbing 
with cayenne is a reprehensible folly, worse than gilding 
refined gold or painting the lily. To be impartial, at 
grand fish-dinners, where turbot is served top and bot- 
tom, let one appear with the brown side, the other witli 
the white side, uppermost 



256 FISH. 

Tarbot may properly be acoompanied by white sauce^ 
relieved by a suspicion of salfc and horse-radish ; plain 
melted butter, smooth and good of the butter ; Dutch 
sauce; delicate anchovy sauce; shrimp sauce, not too 
strong of the shrimps ; oyster sauce (more in harmony 
with cod) ; lobster sauce, or mock-lobster sauce. 

Warmed-up TurboL As soon as the fish is removed 
from table, take all the remaining flesh and white skin 
from the bone, and cut it up into handsome pieces. 
Next day, it may be warmed up in any of the above 
sauces ; although, perhaps, the most delicate way of re- 
dressing it is to let it take a warm bath in Bechamel, 
and reappear smothered in that preparation — so called 
after its inventor, the Marquis de Bechamel, who has 
achieved immoitality by means of that sauce. 

Warmed-up turbot, especially if not overdone, may 
be varied in appearance by being piled in a heap in its 
dish, sprinkling bread-crumbs over it, and setting it 
under a salamander. This way is especially appropriate 
if a few oysters, or remnants of lobster, have been 
warmed up with it 

Cold Turboty with oil and vinegar and a dash of 
mustard, is so like lobster (than which it is much more 
digestible), that, if you shut your eyes, you will hardly 
be able to tell the difference. 

Mayonnaise of Cold Turbot is inferior only to Mayon- 
naise of Lobster. 

Brilly called by Theodore Hook the Workhouse Turbot, 
is 6e^^'ed in every way exactly like turbot Being less 
thick, as well as less firm, it takes a shorter time to cook. 



FISH. 257 

Quite SmaU Turbat and Brilly of the size of ordinary 
soles, are very delicate and presentable fried. They 
also make very pretty attendants to group around their 
boiled full-grown brethren. 

Plaice^ far more than the respectable Brill, deserves 
the scornful title of" workhouse turbot" — as a substitute 
for which it is served, in cheap, fixed-priced Bestau- 
rants, to Parisian cocknies. Poor things 1 they know 
no better! Who should tell them that it is not the 
turbot's habit to make a display of orange spots ? When 
they penetrate, by excursion -train, to Boulogne or 
Dieppe, they are astonished to find that the sea is salt, 
and take home bottlesful, to prove the fact to their 
untravelled firiends. 

The flesh of Plaice is apt to be watery, insipid, and 
soft; the best specimens, nevertheless, taken in full 
season and nicely prepared, are delicate, white-fleshed, 
easy of digestion, and doubtless nutritious. 

Broiled Plaice j — ^the best way of cooking it. Eub 
your fish well with salt on both sides, and hang it up in 
a current of cold, dry air for four-and-twenty or six- 
and-thirty hours. For the convenience of broiling, you 
may without scruple cut it into quarters, sixths, or 
eighths. Serve with oiled butter and lemon-juice. 

Plaice au Gratiuy done in the Oven, Salt and dry 
your fish as before. Take a shallow oval dish (of tin or 
earthenware that will stand the fire), just big enough to 
hold the fisL Grease the bottom well with butter or 
the fat of any gravy you have left, and place a few small 
lumps of it here and there, sufficient to keep the fish from

sticking. Strew over the bottom a thin layer of bread- 
crombs and chopped parsley. Lay your fish in, and 
cover it slightly with bread-crumbs mixed with minced 
sweet herbs, parsley predominating. Over this put a 
few lumps of butter, or of beef or veal fat If you have 
several fish, you may lay them one above the other, put- 
ting a layer of bread-crumbs, &c. between each; but 
they cook better singly, because more equally. 

Set the fish in the oven of your cooking-stove ; baste 
it fi*om time to time with the melted butter and gravy 
which comes firom it When baked enough, the bread- 
crumbs should be nicely browned. 

Fish, so cooked, should be served in the same dish 
in which they were done, set into another belonging to 
the dinner-service; thus avoiding both cooling and 
breaking. Their own gravy will serve for sauce, which 
may be relieved by lemon-juice or a dash of vinegar. 

Large SoUsj Lemon SoleSy and Flounders^ in this 
way, au gratin^ are excellent, and much more easy to 
cook than by fiying. 

Plaice^ Boiledj is mostly Plaice spoiled, except for 
those who are fond of fish-pap. 

TJie Halibict is a monster flat-fish, which often attains 
enormous weights. Its flesh is white, dry, and some- 
what insipid ; but it is light and digestible, and often 
liked by invalids. It is not usual to serve this fish whole, 
but to cut it across in slices, steaks, collops, or cutlets, 
which may be either boiled (delicate, but rather poor), 
fried, or dressed ci la PravenfdUy like Sturgeon (p. 247). 
Slices from the middle of Halibut may be divided and 



_J 



FISH. 259 

bent into convenient-sized cutlets, by cutting them into 
equal halves directly through the backbone. In this way 
they are easier to fry, to arrange on the dish, and to help 
at table. The same mode of division may be applied to 
slices from the thick parts of other large fish (such as 
cod and salmon), which it is customary to dress in 
steaks. Jews have the reputation of cooking Halibut 
better than Christians, because they use oil, and plenty 
of it. 

Stewed Halibut is less tasteless than the above. The 
slices offish may be first half-&ied on both sides, and 
then treated like Stewed Tench (p. 236) ; but in this way 
you conceal the remarkable whiteness of the flesh, which 
constitutes its chief attraction for many ladies and deli- 
cate persons. For a fish curry, halibut answers very 
tolerably. 

Flat-fish Pie. Parboil any solid-fleshed Plat-Fish (as 
soles, small turbot, John dory, or brill), until you can 
raise the flesh from the bones. The less it is done, the 
better. The scales must have been carefully scraped 
from the white side, as the rohite skin is to be left on and 
eaten. Cut the parboiled fish-meats into squares or 
fillets, and sot them aside to cool. Sprinkle them with 
a sTnall quantity of mixed pepper, flour, salt, and the 
minutest dust of pounded lump sugar. 

Invert in the middle of your pie-dish a cupful of strong 
savoury jelly. At the bottom, put a layer of fish-fillets ; 
then a layer of oysters, over which grate a little nutmeg ; 
then more fish, and then more oysters seasoned with 
nutmeg ; and so on, till the dish is full. You may in- 



260 FIBH. 

sert here and there hard eggs in qoarters, batton mush- 
rooms, peeled olires, bits of anchovy, a sprinkling of 
capers, a few picked shrimps, bits of lobster (either flesh 
or coral), and any other suitable garnish which will 
render the contents of the pie more attractive and inter- 
esting. Pour over all the liquor of the oysters (settled 
and strained), the juice of a lemon, and a breakfast-cup- 
ful of strong veal broth, well seasoned to taste. Cover 
the whole with very light paste, and bake. When the 
crust is done, the fish will be so likewise. 

This pie (which need not be so high-seasoned as eel- 
pie) may be eaten either hot or cold. 

Pies may be made of other kinds offish ; only, if dif- 
ferent sorts are used, they should be kinds which require 
the same amount of cooking. Cod and John dory, for 
instance, take twice as long to do as whiting and 
flounder. 

Water Sauchy, Trim very neatly, and cut cross-wise 
in pieces, flounders principally, with which may be 
mixed soles, perch, jack, tench, or eels, also in neat pieces. 
Throw them in a stew-pan with a little more water than 
will cover them, with a handful of chopped parsley, 
peppercorns, salt, and a pinch of pounded sugar. Sim- 
mer till the fish is tender. 

Boil parsley-leaves separately to a bright green ; lay 
them at the bottom of a deep dish, and on this bed deposit 
with a spoon the pieces of fish. Boil up the liquor a 
minute or two longer, and pour it over the fish. Ac- 
company with a plate of brown bread and butter. 

The souchy may bo made witli delicate fish-broth;

or a puree (strained) of fish may be boiled down for the 
purpose. 

Some Dutch cooks add fine-chopped onions and 
sorrel at the same time with the parsley. The sorrel is 
a great improvement 

Soles^ of all Flat-Fish^ are certainly the most useful ; 
in season all the year round, moderate in price, sightly 
on the table, pleasant to the palate, and giving little 
trouble to the digestive powers. In cleaning soles, the 
white skin is always left on, carefully scraping off the 
scales ; the brown skin is usually stripped off, leaving the 
flesh naked. But in some seaport towns, as Dunkirk in 
France, the brown skin, carefully scaled, is lefl on, to 
retain the juices of the fish while cooking. Moreover, 
the brown skin of the sole contains so much gelatine as 
to be used by brewers for fining their beer. Its re- 
moval, therefore, must necessarily diminish the amount 
of nutriment to be derived from the fish. The reader 
can one day request her cook to make the experiment of 
leaving it on. 

Fried Soles^ after thorough drying by pressing be- 
tween the folds of a napkin, may be either rubbed in 
flour, or egged and bread-crumbed, or dipped in batter. 
Let the fat in which they are fried be Iwt and deep. It 
is absurd, because a sole is thin, to attempt to fry it in 
scarcely enough fat to keep it from sticking to the pan. 
Fry crisp, to a nice light brown ; serve on a napkin. 
Well-fried soles hardly require any sauce ; nevertheless, 
you may send up with them a little anchovy or shrimp 
sauce. 



262 nsH. 

Boiled Solesy especiallj when large, are excellent 
In this case, the advantage of leaving the brown skin on 
will be evident. A boiled sole is often one of the first 
light solids which can be set before an invalid, while for 
healthy persons it is ever a delicate and presentable 
dish. 

Throw the soles into boiling salt-and- water. They 
will take from five to ten minutes, according to size. 
Serve on a napkin garnished with green sprigs of parsley. 
Boiled soles do require sauce : for convalescents, oiled 
butter or melted butter are the simplest; for others^ 
any sauce may be sent up wliich is used for turbot 

Some people aver that large soles boiled are very 
nearly as good as turbot ; which does not say much for 
their faculty of taste. Boiled sole, large or small, has 
the flavour, and its flesh has the peculiar substance, of 
soley and not of turbot. That must be a very dull moutli 
which could possibly mistake the one for the other. 
Which is the better of the two is a matter of opinion ; 
but a sole is a sole, and a turbot a turbot 

Sole Normande — Normandy Sole. More for show 
than for use. Take one or more fine soles ; clean and 
wash them carefully. Put a few lumps of butter in an 
oblong dish that will stand the fire. On these lay your 
soles, with sweet herbs, shallots, and mushrooms, all 
chopped fine, pepper and salt, mixed spices, and a 
tumbler of white wine and water. Add to this a well- 
made roux, with which mix an equal quantity of stock. 
Garnish your dish, moreover, with a dozen large oysters 
symmetrically arranged, as many mussels (cooked 



FISH. 263 

enough to remove them from the shell), and a few of 
any small fish (not flat), as smelts or gudgeons, which 
you have at hand, well smeared with butter. Cover all 
this with oiled paper, and set it in the oven to cook. 

While it is doing, warm up some mushrooms in stock 
or gravy, and fry some fanciftdly cut slices of bread. 
When done, arrange the mushrooms and fried bread 
around the dish, garnish with a few crawfish or prawns, 
and serve. 

The best Fillets of Sole are possibly those which are 
removed from the fish as it lies, ready cooked, upon your 
plate. Such, too, appears to be the opinion of the 
Almanack des Gourmands^ which states that Soles have 
the advantage of being allowed to be cut up into fillets, 
at table; there, sprinkled with good lemon-juice and a 
spoonful of virgin oil, they acquire, both for the palate 
and the stomach, most estimable qualities. 

Those who will have real fillets of sole to play with, 
must first remove them from the uncooked fish. ^^ Scale 
the soles, and wash them," Ude directs, "but do not 
empty them. Take up the fillets, by running your knife 
first between the bone and the flesh, then between the 
brown skin and the fillet. By leaning pretty hard on 
the table, they will come ofi^ very neatly. You may 
leave the skin on tlie white side of the soles, provided 
you scrape it well. Cut them in two." 

There are the fillets, then ; what to do with them is 
a point about which few cooks are agreed. They belong 
to the category of fancy articles. They may be rolled 
up lengthwise, stuck through with a wooden skewer, 



264 FISH. 

cooked, and served, curled, with the skewer removed ; 
or they may be served still sticking, curled, two or three 
on a silver skewer ; or they may be baked, rolled up by 
twos and threes, in oiled paper ; or they may be sauted 
flat, that is, curling all sorts of ways. They may be 
boiled, fried, or baked; they may have sharp sauce, 
smooth cream sauce, or rich brown gravy sauce. 

Fillets of Sole a la Horly. Pickle the fillets for an 
hour in a marinade of lemon-juice, chopped parsley, 
sliced onions, pepper and salt Drain them, flour and 
fry them, and serve with tomato sauce. 

Fillets of Sole a VAurore. Take up the fillets of 
four soles ; skin them on both sides. 

Have ready forcemeat, as for quenelles, made of 
whitings (indispensable ; the flesh of soles not mixing 
with any other ingredient), with the spawn of lobsters 
put in, to make it look red. Spread this forcemeat 
over the inside of each fillet, and roll them up. Next 
skewer them with silver skewers, three to each skewer ; 
equalise them with your knife, dust a little pepper and 
salt over them. The forcemeat should have been sea- 
soned rather high. Lay the skewered fillets in a baking- 
pan, cover them with layers of bacon, and bake them. 

When they are done, take out the skewers, pare the 
forcemeat that has protruded, and dish them neatly.

The above receipts suffice to show that filleting, how- 
ever ^^ elegant^' a mode of dressing various kinds offish, 
is neither simple nor economical. It is also questionable 
whether fish, deprived of its natural juices, and saturated 
with a variety of others, is quite so light upon the stomach 
as many persons find desirable.

The John Dory is a flat-fish not yet transformed into 
a side-swimmer ; he, therefore, swims vertically, and has 
eyes which look one to the right, the other to the left. 
He is very voracious in his habits, and is found more 
abundantly in the Channel than in the other British Seas. 
This partial distribution is, perhaps, the cause of his being 
a leede esteemed above his deserts. His flesh is firm, 
white, substantial, requiring more cooking than that of 
most fish. In very large specimens, it is apt to be dry, 
coarse, woolly, thready, and sometimes strong. This 
strong, coarse flavour is derived principally fix)m the skin, 
which renders stewing or baking it unadvisable. For 
the same reason, long keeping is inexpedient, although 
iiie flesh is all the better for not being eaten quite firesh.

John Doiy is a dish which cannot be partaken of (re^ 
quentlj, soon palling upon the appetite. A five or six 
pound fish is quite large enough to be delicate. Quite 
small ones, not bigger than the hand when cleaned and 
divested of their heads, are very nice eating fried, but it 
takes a good many of them to make a disL Fish a little 
larger than those lend themselves voiy readily to broil- 
ing. 

John Dory^ BoUedy is treated in exactly the same way 
as turbot, and is accompanied by the same sauces. In- 
deed, there is an antique pun that, when fishes marry^ 
it will be John Dory witli Ann Chovy. Dory, however, 
requires longer time to boil than turbot, being somewhat 
deceptive in this respect. When the parts near tlie tail 
and round the edges gape open and threaten to fall to 
pieces, the thicker parts in the middle will be still under- 
done. They may be safely allowed time to do; the 
thinner parts will not fall to pieces. 

Cold John Dory is very good soused, or eaten with 
pepper, oil, and vinegar. Warming up again brings out 
its peculiar flavour, which is not delicate enough to ob- 
tain its admission into Yol-au-Yents or Mayonnaises. 

Cod is one of the most useful and excellent fishes 
which the bounty of Ocean oflers to us ; and the big word 
Ocean is purposely employed. Cod difiers much in its 
epicurean merits, though probably not much as to its 
wholesomeness, according to depth of iho waters in which 
it is taken. A deep-sea cod, from the German Ocean 
or the North Sea, is much firmer and better flavoured 
tlian cod caught in the Channel or along shallow shores. 



FISH. 267 

And jet it is not easy to distingaisli them by their outside 
appearance. A shallow-water fish may be in perfect 
healthy with bright eye, hog back, clear skin, rosy gills, 
white flesh, and rigid muscle after death ; and yet, when 
brought to table, will turn out poor, not the thing. The 
fault is often laid on the cook ; the real fault is in the fish 
itself. London is supplied both with first-rate deep-sea 
cod, and also with shallow-water flabby-fleshed cod. 

Here, we can hardly realise the iull value of cod to 
the human race. The Northern nations, more especially, 
manifest both its abundance and the store they set by it. 
In preparing it, they observe the utmost economy. No- 
thing is allowed to be wasted. For salting, the fish is 
decapitated. In the midst of such plenty, improvident 
people would throw the heads away ; not so the North- 
Sea fishermen. In the first place, the tongues — not so 
well known in England as they deserve to be (our ex- 
perience being mainly limited to tlie sound, or swimming- 
bladder, which is taken troixi the body of the fish), — the 
tongues and their roots are cut out and salted separately ; 
also the two delicate bits of meat at the back or nape of 
the fish's neck. The fins are dried, to fiimish glue. 

From her dried cod Norway also makes " fisk meel,'* 
fish-meal, which is sold by Bordevich and Co., of Lofoten, 
in Norway, at less than tenpence the pound avoirdupois. 
The bones and skin and all other useless portions, taken 
out before the grinding, are likewise carefully utilised, 
dried, and minced fine into fish guano, of whose fertilis- 
ing effects learned professors give most flattering certi- 
ficates.

The Lofoten fish-flour does not need unsaltuig, bat 
only a steeping in milk for a couple of hours. Li a dry 
place it will keep a year. It is made into biscuits, which 
are an agreeable relish with a glass of wine. Li fish* 
soups it is excellent ; as well as in others (hare-soup, for 
instance), which many cooks heighten with a dash of 
anchovy.

Serve garnished round with boiled parsnips, and accom- 
panied by egg sauce. 

The parsnips, split lengthwise into halves and quarters, 
may be boiled with the salt fish, and each will help to 
correct the other^s flavour. Besides the parsnips which 
are laid round the fish on serving, others may be mashed 
like turnips, seasoned with a little pepper and butter, and 
sent up as a vegetable accompaniment 

Some of the American ways of managing Salt Fish 
are so ingenious and excellent, that we give a few of 
their receipts. 

Pickedr-up Salt Cod-Fish (American). This is an 
old-fashioned dish and name, but none the less to be 
admired on that account; being, with most persons, when 
properly prepared, a great favourite. Pick up the fish 
in small particles, separating the fibres as near as possible, 
the finer the better. Freshen by leaving it in water one 
hour ; pour off the water, and fill up with firesh ; bring 
it to a scald, pour it off, and put on the fish just enough 
water to cover it ; add, to a quart of the soaked fish, a 
bit of butter the size of half an egg, a very little flour, 
and a dust of pepper. Beat up two eggs, and after 
taking off the fish, thicken it by stirring in the egg. 
Some let it boil after the egg is added; but if this is 
done, the egg will be curdled. Another way is to boil 
eggs, chop and mix them in the gravy. — Mrs. E. F. 
HaskelL 

Kedgeree (Idem). Boil rice; add any picked -up 



270 FISH. 

fish ; heat It together, and while' hot stir into the mix- 
ture a beaten egg ; serve hot. 

Cod'Fish Toast (Idem). Freshen nicely picked-up 
cod-fish, by laying it in water all night ; add, if you 
have it, sweet cream and an egg, and heat it boiling 
hot ; pour it over toast, or make a gravy of water and 
butter ; beat up two or three eggs, and thicken the gravy 
without allowing it to curdle, and pour it over toast. 

Cod-Fish Hash (Idem). Put in soak over-night a 
teacup of cod-fish picked ap fine. Li the morning boil 
some potatoes nicely, mash and work them until very 
light. Put the fish in the chopping-bowl and chop it 
fine, aft;er which, before taking it &om the bowl, mash 
and work it until as fine as possible. Work the potato 
in little by little, work it with the potato-pounder, until 
five parts of potato are thoroughly incorporated with the 
fish. This should be so perfectly done tliat the fish can 
neither be seen nor felt in the mouth separate firom the 
potato. Season the hash a little richer than for mashed 
potatoes. Put it in the potato-kettle and heat it, con- 
stantly stirring. Have butter heated in the spider, press 
the hash into it firmly, and cook it gently. When brown, 
turn it out without breaking, and set it in the oven 
until the coffee is on the table. It is better, however, 
to leave it in the spider, if not scorching, until it is served. 
This is a very different dish fi-om that called by many 
cod-fish hash. Always buy white cod-fisL 

Cod-Fish Balls (Idem). Pick up as fine as possible 
a teacup of nice white cod-fish. Freshen all night, or, 
if wanted for any otlier meal than breakfiist, from the

morning ; scald it once^ and drain off the water. Put it 
in the chopping-bowl^ chop and work it until entirely 
fine ; put it in a basin with water, a bit of buttef the 
size of an egg, and two eggs ; beat it thoroughly, and 
heat until it thickens, without boiling. It should, when 
all is mixed, be about a quart Have some potatoes 
ready prepared and nicely mashed, work the fish and 
potatoes thoroughly together as above, make it in flat 
cakes, and brown both sides. This is a very nice dish, 
as all who have tried it allow. 

Codi Sounds and Tongues Pie. Take equal quan- 
tities of tongues and sounds; steep tliem as above 
directed. 

Put into a stew->pan two ounces of fresh butter and 
four ounces of sliced onions. Fry them of a nice bright 
brown ; then put in a dessert-spoonful of flour, and stir 
in half a pint of stock (or of meager broth, if the pie is 
for abstinence-days). When smooth, put in your sounds 
and tongues; season with a little pepper, a glass of 
white wine, a teaspoonful of essence of anchovy, and 
the juice of half a lemon. Let them stew for about five 
minutes, stirring to prevent burning and to combine the 
ingredients evenly. Then aiTange the tongues and sounds 
in a pie-dish, intermingling with them a few raw oysters 
and hard-boiled eggs cut in quarters. Pour the sauce 
over all, and cover with a light paste. Bake in a lively 
oven, to make the crust rise nicely. When it is done, 
the pie will be done. 

Cold Fishy whether Salt or Fresh^ the remains of what 
was boiled the day before, makes excellent Fies or Patties ^ 



272 FISH. 

as do remnants of lobster^ eel, fried sole, boiled salmon, 
&c. 

If intended for a Pie^ take the skin off and the bones 
out while still warm from table. Arrange your fish in 
the pie-dish in layers, seasoning each layer with spice 
and salt, until the dish is full. 

Save a little of the liquor that the fish was boiled in 
set it on the fire with the skin and bones of the fish 
boil till you have extracted all the goodness out of them 
strain, let settle, and pour what is clear over the fish in 
the pie-dish. Put on the crust, and bake as before. 
The same addition of oysters, shrimps, or hard-boiled 
eggs may be made, and wiU be a great improvement 

If for Patties^ the fish and its additions should be 
cut up into small pieces, and tossed up in white sauce 
made with cream or milk, and delicately seasoned to 
taste. 

Fresh Cod. Supposing you are in possession of a 
fine whole cod (which is often the most economical way 
of purchasing it), it will supply you with at least three 
handsome dishes to appear on your table, without reckon- 
ing the service that may be got out of what is left. The 
three very substantial and good-looking portions into 
which a cod may be cut up are, the Head and Shoulders ; 
the Middle ; and the Tail Part. This last should be con- 
sumed first ; cut across into steaks, and fried. The other 
two (well rubbed with salt, inside and out, and hung up 
in a current of cool, dry air) may be, one and either of 
them, baked or boiled, reserving the Middle for the last 
to be eaten. 



FISH. 273 

On buying a whole cod, it is always worth whUe to 
see what curiosities are contained in its stomach, which 
is sometimes quite a museum of deep-sea natural-history 
specimens. The Cod is blessed with a capital appetite, 
and in fact is a most voracious eater, not in the least 
particular as to the items which make up its bill of fare. 
Digestibles and indigestibles are swallowed indifferently. 
Hence it has been called the Ostrich of the Sea. All 
sorts of unaccountable substances find their way down 
its greedy gullet — ^potatoes, birds, and even stones as big 
as a goose's egg. At one post-mortem examination of a 
cod-fish, the Doctor found a fine black puppy-dog ; and 
the fishmonger who performed the operation had taken 
the knife which executed it out of the stomach of another 
cod-fish. 

Warn the kitchen-maid who cleans the fish not to 
tear out and throw away the sound, as ignorant scullions 
have done before now, and will probably do again. The 
very thin black film of skin lining the interior should be 
peeled off; the liver is to be set aside, to boil with the 
portion resented for boiling ; but, when obtainable, the 
best liver to eat with Boiled Cody or to make Liver Sauce 
for fish, is Skate Liver. 

In opening the fish, let great care be taken not to 
wound the roe, which is often large enough to make a 
small dish by itself. 

Cod*8 JRoey BoUedy should be cooked separately in a 
saucepan (even if it is to be served together with a portion 
of the fish from which it was taken), because it takes much 
longer cooking. There is a saying that cod's roe, over- 

T 



274 FISH* 

done, is poison ; i, e. it cannot be over-done. The same 
thing is said, with less truth, of mackarel. 

Cod^a Iio€y Fried (when cold, after boiling, and cut 
in slices), makes a very nice accompaniment to decorate 
a Middle or a Head and Shoulders. 

Few fish give less trouble to clean than Cod. Many- 
people prefer it after a couple of days* keeping. 

Crimped Cod is fish whose flesh has been deeply- 
slashed, the whole of its length, at regular distances of 
about a couple of inches, while still alive. This is done 
with tlie intention of making the flesh firmer ; crimping 
after death does not produce the same efiect. It is an 
unnecessary piece of cruelty ; because, in almost every 
case, the individual so practised on is a deep-sea fish^ 
who does not require it, but whose flesh is quite firm 
enough without the operation. 

But the truth is, that we have so little sympathy 
with fish, they show so little consideration for one an- 
other, they are so utterly unable to manifest their sense 
of pain or pleasure by howls or cries or in any other 
way likely to impress us, that we are apt to regard them 
as devoid of feeling — as endowed merely with a sort of 
sensationless vitality like that of vegetables. Neverthe* 
less, some pet gold-fish, standing on the table at which, 
this is written, peep out fi'om their grove of water-starwort 
with looks as if they recognised the old familiar face 
which meets their gaze day aft;er day. The minnow i» 
a remarkably tamable fish. 

Mr. McDiarmid, giving an account of certain fishes 
kept in a pond of sea-water, says that some of them wero 



FISH. 275 

so perfectly tame, that they would eat greedily out of 
the hand ; while others were so shy, that the keeper 
discoursed of their different tempers as a thing quite as 
evident as their different sizes. The tamest of all was a 
gigantic Cod, the patriarch of the pond, which the man 
said answered to his name, and not only drew near, but 
put up his snout beseechingly when he heard the word 
^' Tom." After spending fifteen years in captivity, in- 
creasing gradually in bulk and weight, he went blind, 
possibly from age. The fisherman was evidently fond of 
him, and very kind; and it was really affecting to 
observe the animal raising himself in the water, resting 
his head on the feeding-stone, and allowing it to be 
gently patted or stroked. 

The Cod-fish, paraphrasing Shylock, may say, " If 
you caress me, do I not come ? If you crimp me, do I 
not feel ?" 

CodCs Head and Shoulders^ Boiled. Crimped cod 
may be put on with the water hot ; it is safer to put on 
an entire, unslashed, large piece of cod, with the water 
cold or tepid, unless it has become very firm indeed by 
several days' salting and drying. The thickness of the 
fish must regulate the time of boiling, but alcut half an 
hour will suflBce. Serve on a napkin ; garnish with 
scraped horse-radish, or parsley, or both ; surround with 
slices of fried roe and pieces either of its own or of skate's 
liver; and accompany with oyster sauce. It is also 
eaten with Dutch sauce, Caper sauce, Anchovy sauce, 
or Shrimp sauce.

Each of ihese parts should contain^ in its natural 
place, the portion of sound which belongs tx> it 

(MCs Head and Shmtlders^ Baked. If the fish may 
not be served in the dish in which it is cooked, it must 
be tied about with broad tape, to assist its removal ; but 
it is much better to avoid such removal, by placing the 
baking-dish in another, to be served. 

Take a good-sized, deep, open pie-dish, big enough 
to hold your cod's head and shoulders without being 
cramped for space. Stuff the fore-part of the fish with 
veal stuffing ; or, if preferred, you may serve forcemeat 
balls round it instead. Lay the fish in the dish in its 
natural position, L e. with the thick part of the back 
upwards. Mix flour and water (cold) very thin, and 
pour it over the fish till the dish is half or three-quarters 
&1I. Dust into it a little pepper ; add a dozen or more 
oysters and their liquor (according to the number of 
guests), and a couple of anchovies filleted and cut into 
short lengths. Lay pieces of butter all over the back 
of your fish, and set into a gentle oven.. 

When the butter is melted, baste your fish, continuing 
to do so from time to time, imtil enough ; which will 
depend upon the heat of your oven. It is not desirable 
that the skin should be much browned, if at all, which 
may be avoided by covering it with oiled paper. 

When quite done, if you serve the fish in its baking- 
dish, put, with a spoon, all the liquid portion of the 
gravy you can get into a saucepan, to reduce by boiling 
down (straining, if required, or thickening), seasoning 
with lemon-juice or any other simple flavour that may be 



FISH. 277 

liked. After it has been nicely finished to your taste, pour 
it hot over your fish, add the forcemeat balls, and serve. 

Remnants of Cod make a sightly and agreeable dish 
Heated'Up thus : Pick the flakes of fish away £rom the 
bones and skin before they get cold. When wanted, 
put them into a stew-pan with what is left of the sauce 
(oyster, anchovy, or other) with which they were origin- 
ally served. Add a dozen or more firesh oysters and 
their liquor. K those are not enough to moisten the fish 
(and it only requires to be just moistened), make up the 
deficiency with a spoonftil or two of melted butter. 
Warm very careftilly over a gentle fire ; when once hot 
through, set it aside. 

Surround your dish (previously well heated) with a 
wall of delicate mashed potatoes, so as to leave a hollow 
in the middle. In this hollow deposit your warmed-up 
fish, with its sauce. Sprinkle, over the fish only, grated 
bread-crumbs or biscuit-raspings ; set it for a few minutes 
in a sharp oven or under a salamander; and when nicely 
browned on the top, serve. 

Ling and Hahe^ likewise species of the genus GaduSj 
are treated in every way like Cod ; to which, as a rule, 
they are considered inferior, being coarser, harder, and 
more insipid. To this judgment, however, there are 
persons who demur, something depending on the waters 
and the latitude in which the fish is taken. They are 
very largely salted in the North of Europe. The Nor- 
wegians have a mode of drying Ling which renders its 
flesh semi-transparent. In this singular and jelly-like 
state, it is served as a dainty dish on gala days. 



278 PISH. 

The Coatr-fish^ another GaduSj so called from its sooty- 
complexion, is an excellent fish, its meat being inter- 
mediate between that of the Cod and the Whiting. 
Dress exactly like Cod, from which few people would be 
able to distinguish it by the sense of taste. 

The Whiting^ the most delicate of the family, some- 
times attains a considerable size ; in which case it must 
bo treated like cod, only it requires a much shorter time 
to cook. Quite small whiting can only be fried. Inter- 
mediate-sized can either be fried or scalded. 

Scalded Whiting. Few dishes are more proper than 
this to set before an invalid in an early stage of con- 
yalescence, not even a boiled sole, which may be pre- 
sented a day or two after the whiting. 

Open your fish by the belly ; empty them, carefully 
removing the black internal film, and reserving the roes 
and livers, which are delicate. Take out the eyes ; lay 
the fish in salt for several hours, or all night. 

Bend each fish into a circle by thrusting its tail 
through the eye-holes. Throw them into boiling water, 
which let boil up once, skim, and set on the side of the 
stove. Small fish will be done in five or eight minutes. 
Take them out of the water instantly you judge they are 
enough. 

Serve on a napkin ; the simplest sauce is the best to 
send up with them. None is better than very fresh and 
sweet butter oiled. Still, several more highly flavoured 
sauces, as oyster, anchovy, or shrimp, are perfectly 
appropriate. 

Fried Whiting. Prepare and arrange these as before, 



FISH. 279 

with the tail stack through the eyes, only toitliout the 
salting. 

Some cooks have their whitings for frying skinned — 
a questionable practice, best avoided. If the whitings 
are badlt/ fried, the absence of the skin allows them to 
become sodden with grease ; and if they are toell fried, the 
skin, left on, will retain the natural juices and flavour of 
the fish. They are done in a very short space of time, 
requiring little more than a good plunge into a deep bath 
of boiling fat 

The Haddock^ anotlior of the Cod family, is an ex- 
cellent fish, with firm, M'ell-flavoured flesh. When large, 
it is dressed in the same way as cod, and takes an equal 
time to cook — much longer than whiting. 

Small Iiaddock and codlings^ like under-sized whiting, 
may be either boiled or fried, with the same preparation. 
They scarcely hold together well enough to stand broiling 
without considerable trouble. 

Finnan Haddocks (smoked), if recent, need only be 
laid on a gridiron over a gentle fire, or toasted, or set 
in the oven of the cooking-stove. If old and dry, they 
will be the better for steeping half an hour or longer in 
tepid water, or milk and water, before cooking. 

SkatCy not a very digestible fish, nor desirable to par- 
take of too frequently, is considered to be the better for 
keeping or travelling, as rendering its flesh less stringy. 

SkatCy Boiled, For this, select a large fish, or part 
of one ; as it is often sold piecemeal, by the pound. 
The skinning, &c. is so troublesome, that it ought to be 
done by the fishmonger. Cut the fish into squares, or

Fried Skate. Small fish, commonly called Afaidsy are 
mostly cooked in this way, as may also be the thinner 
parts of large skate. The latter also, cnt into strips, 
twisted into ronnds, stnek through with a skewer, 
and fried, are often called Crimped State, These, 
fried, may be used to lay round a dish of Boiled Skate. 
Cold Fried Skate is good, eaten with pepper, oil, and 
vinegar. 

Machardj Bailed. Empty by an orifice near the gills 
made as small as possible, leaving the roes in their place. 
Many cooks set mackarel on the fire in cold water, for 
fear of breaking the skin and splitting the tail. Tweniy 
minutes after boiling up will be long enough, though some 
like them to simmer longer. Serve on a napkin, on a 
bed of green fennel-leaves, accompanied by fennel, goose- 
berry, anchovy, or shrimp sauce. Melted butter, with 
a dash of mustard and vinegar, makes as nice a sauce 
for mackarel as it does for salmon. 

Mackarely Bakedj au Grratin. The same as plaice au

Mackarel may be Broiled^ prepared as above, omitting

the flouring; but the .fish is rather too dry for grilling, 
and in that case requires smearing with butter or 
oil. 

Potted Mackarel (p. 84). 

Grat/ Mullet J when large, may be boiled and served 
with the same sauce as mackarel or salmon, to which its 
flavour is sometimes rather rashly compared. But it is 
a fish which is very diversely appreciated, owing perhaps 
to its habit of prowling about the mouths of estuaries 
and grubbing in the mud. Small Gray Mullet may be 
baked au graJtm^ or firied.

cock of the Sea, because it is usual to cook them scaled,

repute with epicures, but not particularly light of

valuable fish is too oily to fiy, unless treated as Sardines 
are in the South of Europe, L e. plunged into a cauldron 
of boiling oil. Coddled in fat in the frying-pan, it is 
unwholesomely greasy, being almost sure to rise in the 
stomach.

to face, pressing them down hai*d, to make the contact as 
close and complete as possible ; then grill, taking care in 
turning them not to separate the fish. They take some- 
what longer time than single herring to do thoroughly. 

Broiled White Herring need no sauce except a little 
4$alt to eat with them. 

Potted Herring (p. 85). 

Broiled Sprats. Do them over a sharp, clear fire, 
and eat them the instant they are off the gridiron. To be 
really good, they should be cooked in the room in which 
ihey are eaten. 

Potted Sprats (p. 85). 

Tlie Gurnards^ Gray and Redy the latter most 
•esteemed because most showy, are firm, white-fleshed 
fish, of good flavour, and not difficult of digestion — ^a 
little dry, perhaps; which the cook must remedy by 
plenty of butter. The best way of dressing them is to 
bake them with a stuffing, like pike, or au gratin^ with 
•crumbs and sweet herbs. Nevertheless, they may be 
boiled and served with anclwvy or other relishing sauce. 
-Quito small ones can be firied. 

Tlie Weevers (the Great and the Lesser) have white) 
dry, agreeable flesh, wholesome, but second-rate in quality. ' 



FISH, 283 

Great Weevers may bo boiled, but tlie Lesser are mostly 
too small to be cooked otherwise than by firyinff. The 
smaUer species affords very pretty anglLg^m piers 
and jetties, biting freely ; but it must be stuck with a 
fork, to take it off the hook. Both the Weevers are 
armed with spines, which inflict a sting whose pain, often 
severe, is believed by fishermen to last until the turn of 
the tide during which it was received. 

The Ccnger has white, dry, poor-flavoured flesh, 
which people (especially Boman Catholics) put up with 
as a matter of duty, and for want of something better. 
Small ones may be cooked in the same way as eels, but 
are far inferior to them. When large, the best mode of 
dressing is, 

Conger^ Roasted. Take a handsome piece out of the 
middle of a fish ; skin it ; let it lie a few hours in salt and 
vinegar, mixed with chopped sage and parsley or other 
sweet herbs. Stuff it with veal stuffing ; bind with broad 
tape, and roast before the fire with a bottle-jack, dredging 
with flour and basting well with butter till done. 

Thicken the gravy in a stew-pan with a little flour ; 
season with a dash of vinegar, or Harvey or Anchovy 
sauce, and pour it over the fish on serving. Accompany 
with lemon cut in halves for each guest to squeeze over 
his portion of fish. 

Conger Pie. The Conger is abundant on the coasts 
of Cornwall, where the inhabitants cordially welcome his 
visits. To Comishmen, nothiog comes amiss in a pie.

a saying to the effect that the Old One himself never 
visits Cornwall, for fear of being put into a pie. Conger 
pie, however, is a local dainty of preeminent and 
universal excellence, . standing quite at the head of the 
list of articles worthy of a pasty crown of glory. The 
clotted cream and parsley peculiar to the west are like- 
wise necessaiy as ingredients. In no other country is 
conger pie to be had in equal excellence ; nowhere else 
is the luxury so highly valued and so thoroughly under- 
stood. Still, the Conger is served in a variety of ways, 
and it is not only in a pie that he is eaten. As a rule, 
the pie is his natural destination, but he is also fre- 
quently broiled and fried, according to the taste of the 
consumer. — Land and Water ^ September 29, 1866. 

Fricasseed Froga^ Chicken-wise. Although Frogs 
are not fish, they are classed by the Boman Catholic 
Church in the list of meager animal fo^ ; and therefore 
their place is more appropriate here than any where else. 
In spite of the great prejudice against their employment 
which has existed in England from time immemorial, 
Frogs afford a light, nutritious diet, especially adapted 
for invahds. It is a time-honoured, vulgar prejudice, 
that Frenchmen are a nation who live on frogs ; which 
iliey do not, for the simple motive that the supposed 
national dish is far too dear. There is no reasoning 
about these matters of taste ; it is a question partly of 
fashion, but mainly of use. It will be said that the frog 
is a reptile. True ; so likewise is the high-priced turtle: 
and in the equatorial regions of the world, several large 
lizards are eagerly captured for the sake of the delicacy 



FISH. 285 

of their flesh. The ancient repute of viper broth, as a 
regenerator, is notorious. 

Time, and international intercourse, will bring about, 
in all probability, considerable change in our estimate of 
sundry foreign eatables. Caviare and Pate de Foie Gras 
are slowly winning their way to populariiy, and a similar 
destiny may be in store for frogs. Fifty years ago, the 
following advertisement, from the Times, would have 
been considered as a sign of national decadence. Who 
would have thought, at the commencement of the pre- 
sent century, that England would ever have been thus 
degraded, and that the blood of Nelson would have been 
shed in vain ? ^^ French Fboos and Narbonne Honey. 
— "Ratt. and Son beg to announce, they have received 
importations of the above delicious rarities in original 
packages." 

We, therefore, give an esteemed French receipt, 
without seriously expecting that it will be executed here ; 
because the lest kind of edible &og (all are edible), if 
occasionally found in Great Britain, is very rare. But 
as many persons, entertaining a strong prejudice against 
ihem, have been entrapped (not very good-naturedly) into 
eating frogs, by calling them spring chicken, a more 
harmless and more practicable joke would be to offer 
portions of chicken under the guise of frogs — ^mock frog, 
in &ct, as we ixiake mock turtle out of calf's head — to 
find out whether pretended connoisseurs are able to 
detect the difference. 

For those who like them, or who dare venture to 
taste them, frogs ready prepared for cooking may be

obtained, not only from the above-named firm, but from 
France. They are not uncommonly sent over as presents 
to friends. The hind portion only of the animal is eaten ; 
the body being cut in two at the waist, and the upper 
part rejected. The skin is then stripped o£Pthe loins and 
legs, and the feet chopped off at the ankles. As the flesh 
is beautifully white, and the legs are twisted in a peculiar 
way, they may easily be mistaken for wings of chicken 
that have been skinned before turning back the pinion 
.in the usual way. A dish of mock ftx>gs is no great 
extravagance, as the remainder of the fowl will make a 
good chicken pie. 

For real frogs, after skinning, make them take a turn 
or two in a saucepan of boiling water; then throw them 
into cold water, and put them into a saucepan with 
button mushrooms, a bunch of parsley, cliives, garlic^ 
two cloves, and a bit of butter. Add a pinch of flour, 
and moisten with a glass of white wine and a little broth. 
Throw in some pepper and salt, cook them till they are 
tender. Take them out; boil down the sauce to a smaller 
quantity ; thicken it with yolks of egg^ and a bit of 
butter : tlu*ow in some chopped and scalded parsley, and 
pour it over the frogs in their dish. 

Oysters are popularly held to be in season only in the 
months which are spelt with an r, {,€• from September to 
April inclusive. The opinion of the most competent autho- 
rities now is that the oyster season both begins and closer 
too soon. They are hardly at their best before the end of 
October or the beginning of November ; and they are often 
still excellent till the end of May or the middle of June. 



FISH. 387 

The grand consumption of oysters is made in their 
uncooked state, with or without a seasoning of lemon- 
juice or vinegar and pepper. The French make a 
coarsely ground preparation of white pepper, expressly 
to eat with oysters, called " Mignionette ;" which also^ 
entering in large proportion into a sauce, causes it to be 
called " Mignionette Sauce." Uncooked oysters have a 
great reputation as restoratives ; but to those for whose 
stomachs they are found too cold and heavy, we recom- 
mend the following receipts. 

Stewed Oysters. In opening them, leave the beards 
on ; carefiilly save every drop of the liquor, which strain 
from bits of shell and other impurities. At the bottom 
of a stew-pan put a good lump of butter ; when it begins 
to melt, put to it your oysters and their liquor. Dredge 
them with a very little flour, and dust them with a 
pinch of pepper and grated nutmeg. Keep shaking 
them round and round in the saucepan, till the sauce 
is smooth and well incorporated. Keep them also at 
a good distance over the fire, or at the side, or on tlie 
hot iron plate of your cooking-stove, until the oysters 
are all well warmed through. If they boil, they become 
leathery. 

At the bottom of a hot vegetable-dish lay a thin 
slice of toast, nicely browned. On this arrange your 
oysters with a spoon. Boil up the sauce an instant, and 
pour it over them. 

The genuine flavour of the oysters is preferable to any 
other ; but for those who like it, it may be heightened 
with lemon-peel, lemon-juice, or essence of anchovy. A 



288 FISH. 

shred of horse-radish adds an agreeable zest, but is apt 
to be trying to weak stomachs. 

Roasted Oysters^ A, Open the oysters, detaching 
them only from the upper shell, with wliich then cover 
the oyster and its juice in the lower shell. Put them in 
an oven until well hot through. Serve them on a large 
dish, accompanied by pats of cold butter to put into 
them, and a plate of brown bread and butter. 

Roasted Oysters^ B. Open the oysters, removing 
them entirely from their shell, and saving the liquor, 
which strain, and put into a stew-pan with a bit of 
butter, chopped parsley, pepper, and lemon-juice. Give 
the oysters just a warm-up in this. Select the largest 
and handsomest shells, both upper and under; into 
each of these put three or four oysters and as much of 
the sauce as they will hold. Set them in an oven, or on 
a gridiron, until they are thoroughly hot without boiling, 
and serve. 

Fried Oysters. Procure the largest oysters you can ; 
give them just a scald over the fire in their own liquor ; 
steep them for an hour or two in salt, pepper, grated 
nutmeg, and lemon-juice. Dip them in batter, and fry 
them lightly in plenty of hot fat, exactly as you would 
fritters. They require great care not to over-do them ; 
in which case they will turn out homy. 

Fried Oysters make an elegant garnish to Boiled 
Cod or other large fisL 

Oyster Pie. Very nice. (American.) Cover a deep 
jjate (a soup-plate answers perfectly) with puff-paste;

nicely. When done, fill the pie with oysters; season 
with pepper, salt, and batter; dnst over a little flour, 
and cover with a thin crust of puff-paste. Bake quickly ; 
when the top crust is done, the oysters should be. Serve 
as soon as baked, as the crust quickly absorbs the gravy. 
This pie is quite as good cold as hot, and is excellent for' 
picnics or for travelling. 

Scalloped Oysters. The proper utensil in which to 
dress and serve this favourite supper dish is the natural 
hollow shell of the scallop, or, in default thereof, in 
small dishes made of tin, in imitation of their shape and 

size. 

Scald the oysters in their own liquor ; take off the 
beards, from which squeeze all the liquor they contain ; 
add it to the other, and strain. 

Warm up the bearded oysters in this, with a little 
pepper, pounded mace, or grated nutmeg, a little piece 
of butter, and a slight dust of flour, taking care not to 
let them come to a boil. The liquor of the oysters will 
contain sufficient salt 

Line the bottom of the scallop-shells with bread- 
crumbs ; on these put a layer of oysters ; then a few more 
bread-crumbs ; and then more oysters. Moisten with a 
few teaspoonfuls of the liquor ; cover again with bread- 
crumbs thickly; lay a few small bits of butter here and 
there; garnish the top with a very small sprinkling of 
fine-chopped parsley; and set in an oven or under a 
salamander until the whole is well heated through, and 
the surface nicely crisp and brown.

way. Hnsiliiig them in saucepan over the fire until 
the meat oomes easily away firom the shell is a sufficient 
preliminaiy cooking. 

Oyster Pudding , in Sccdlap^SheUs. Scald the oysters 
in their own liquor. Take them out, drain, and chop 
them fine. Take crumb of bread soaked in cream, fine* 
chopped parsley, chives, anchovy, pepper, and a, bit of 
fresh butter^melted to oil. Mix these thoroughly with 
the chopped oysters, adding at the same time one or two 
raw beat-up eggs. Smear the bottom of your scallop- 
shells with butter ; fill them with the above composition ; 
sprinkle bread-crumbs over the surface, and set them in 
the oven till delicately browned. 

Scallops require a deal of cooking, after which they 
are wholesome and palatable food — Soyer calls them 
** exceedingly fine" — ^but they are never lighty and cannot 
be eaten frequently. Haw — in the same way as un- 
cooked oysters — ^they are apt to cause an indigestion 
which will take days to get rid of. 

On opening the scallops, remove the beards; wash 
them in two or three waters, to get rid of sand, &c. ; and 
let them lie an hour or two in salt-and-water. 

Stew them in water or broth, witli a little pepper, 
butter, and flour, for a couple of hours, or more, till 
tender. They can then be served, like stewed oysters, 
on toast ; or scalloped ; or fried ; or put into a pie. For 
patties, they must be well chopped, and stirred up 
together with some delicate yet well-seasoned sauce. 

Scallops of Cold Veal or Chicken^ are a mode of 
serving flesh under a meager disguise. Mince the meat

small. Warm it up in a saucepan with a little cream, 
pepper, grated nutmeg, and chopped lemon-peel. Nearly 
fill the scallop-shells with this ; cover with bread-crumbs 
and a dust of chopped parsley ; lay a few little bits of 
butter on the top, and brown in the oven or under a 
salamander. 

Mussels a la Poulette (French). Hustle your mus- 
sels as directed at page 91. When done, remove the 
half-shell which does not contain the meat ; take the weed 
and the crab, if any, from the mussel, and arrange each 
half-shell containing its mussel neatly piled or packed in 
an open dish. 

Pour over them, scalding hot, a sauce made as fol- 
lows. Make melted butter, not with water, but with the 
liquor from the mussels, after letting it settle, with a 
liberal allowance of butter. Add a sprinkling of pepper, 
and as much vinegar as will give it a decided sharpness. 
Some cooks heighten this sauce with nutmeg or mace, 
chopped parsley and chives ; the Doctor prefers it with- 
out these latter.

or tin cases. If the latter, the lid (fastened down with 
wax) must be lieated in order to get it off. Useful for 
Fish Soups, Quenelles of Fish, Fish Puddings, Sauces, 
or as an accompaniment to dishes of that description. 
The following directions are Norwegian, and may be 
varied to suit the English taste.

grated nutmeg, cream, and butter. Add thereto a

This preparation may be served in scallop-shells,

Summemudlery Norwegian Lohsier Powder ^ is em- 
ployed exactly as the preceding. It is very convenient 
to have in the house, in case Lobster Sauce, or Lobster 
Patties, are unexpectedly required. For the former, 
steep it in milk half an hour, and then treat it as directed 
either for Lobster Sauce, or, better, as in Lobster Sauce 
without Lobster (p. 115). 

Crabsj Lobsters^ ajid Sea Crawfish may be bought 
ready-cooked in London and other large towns — a great 
convenience. Crabs especially require great attention in 
boiling. They must be put on the fire with the water 
cold; 4 if it is hot, or even if it warms too quickly, they 
have the extraordinary faculty of shooting their claws ; 
a crab plunged into hot water will in half a minute, or 
less time perhaps, have thrown off every one of its 
claws ; and both thev and the dismembered carcase will 
be spoiled, not only in appearance, but also in quality, 
by the water entering them. And the difficulty is, that 
all these crustaceans cooked after death are eitlier quite 
inferior or good for nothing. In mild weather, wrapped 
in a damp cloth or in sea-weed, they will live a consider- 
able time out of water ; but a short exposure to frost 
kills them even more rapidly than the summer's heat. 

The lobster does not shoot its claws so readily as the 
crab ; still it is better to sot it on the fire with the water

cold, letting it heat veiy gradually; which causes 
the creature to faint away, rather than to die a sudden 
deatk Although these animals are so ferocious and 
destructive that we need have no scruple in eating thenii 
one would not put them to unnecessary suffering. An 
American direction is, ^^To boil a lobster, the pot 
should be full of strong salted water, boiling hot Put 
the fish in the pot, aUve, while boiling hard, toith its head 
downwardy thai it may die as quickly as passible ;^^ but it 
is difficult to understand how a lobster, with a couple of 
fine claws protruding before it, can be made to take 
this fatal header into the pot. The crawfish, having no 
large claws, can perform the feat more easily. 

When the shell-fish, set on in cold water, is quite 
dead, throw in a good handful of salt. Bemove the 
scum as it rises. After boiling up, a large crab or 
lobster will take firom twenty minutes to half an hour's 
further boiling, weU covered and galloping. Some fish- 
mongers and cooks are apt to take them up too soon ; the 
former to avoid diminishing their weight, the latter to 
retain their juiciness and flavour : but in that case the 
contents of the body or the head are likely to be no^ setj 
watery — ^which is a great defect. 

Abroad, shell-fish are mostly boiled in court-bouillon ; 
a practice which neither suits English tastes nor stomachs. 
Boiling in plain salt-and-water is preferable, especially if 
it is desired to retain the genuine flavour of the fish. 

Grab is reputed more digestible than lobster ; and the 
claw of the lobster than the tail. The crawfish is the 
most indigestible of the three, with harder flesh, and a

alight musky Savour which is far from agreeable to 
manj palates. Cheap Paris Bestaurants sometimes 
serve crawfish (Langouste) instead of the true lobster 
{Homard) ; but the substitution is permissible for imita* 
tion lobster sauce, at most. The crawfish has a wider 
southern range; it is found in tolerable plenty in the 
Mediterranean, at the bottom of whose clear waters it is 
speared and spoiled: whereas, the far more delicious 
lobster is found abundantly on the rocky coasts of 
Norway, the United Kingdom, and North America* 
Preserved lobster, hermetically sealed in tin cases, from 
distant fisheries, is acceptable, for want of better ; but it 
is far inferior to and more uncertain in quality than our 
own home-caught and home-boiled fish. 

Crabj Plaiuy Coldy opened and with its claws cracked^

Crabj Dressed^ Cold, Open the crab, by raising its 
body (in which the limbs are inserted), from the cara- 
pace or shell, without breaking the latter. Carefully 
remove the gills and other uneatable parts. Pick all 
the white meat from the claws and body ; do the same 
with what is good of the inside, Le. the white and yellow 
curd and the coral. Chop these tolerably fine ; mix them 
together, seasoning with oil, vinegar, mustard, and 
pepper; then return them to the empty shell, garnishing 
with sprigs of fresh green parsley. 

It is usual for crab so dressed to be accompanied by 
salad, rolls, and pats of nice butter.

sprinkle bread-crumbs on the top, and brown it under a

The female crab is more delicate than the male ; her 
inside, also, i8 almost always fuller and finnet. Thedif- 
ference of sex is known at a glance. The female has a

larger claws of the two, but with a coarser quality of 
flesh.

Lobster Salad. [From London Society, November 
1863.] AU receipts utterly fail in utility, if the con-

Having caught or possessed yourself of a fine lobster, 
which you intend to eat, it is, of course, first necessary 
to cook it. And here I find myself differing with various 
culinary men of distinction. Generally, their advice is, 
^' Put them alive, with their claws tied together, into the 



296 FI8H. 

water when boiling hot" Lobsters .must be boiled ; they 
are bred to be boiled and turn red in the face ; and a 
little more or less of suffering is only the difference of 
extracting a double or a single tooth. We all go to the 
dentists ; the lobsters go to pot : in that pot, let your 
water be cold: if near the sea, water from the ocean; 
if inland, water well salted ; the time of cooking com- 
mencing from the bubbling of the water. 

Take eggs in accordance to the size of your salad; 
let them be boiled as hard as eggs can be boiled, then 
cooled^ in fresh, or iced water, if possible ; extract the 
yolks, and with a well-cleaned silver or porcelain spoon 
— the latter preferable— pound them into fine powder. 

This done, mix the eggs with salt, mustard, and 
cayenne, and the berry (if it be a female), and some of 
the selected interior of the animal; to which add vinegar 
and the most fresh and luscious cream. It avails 
nothing to teiryou of the proportions — ^the mere smat- 
tering of a cookery-book ; I leave it to the taste of the 
conoocter. 

Your sauce well and sufficiently mixed, extract the 
nutritious flesh of the animal from all parts save the head 
— ^though some savana will tell you that the fat of the 
head or body is, par excelleneej the best part of the lob- 
ster — and cut it in pieces, but not too small. 

Take several fine yellow-hearted lettuces; do not 
soak them in water, but take leaf firom leaf; use only 
the best ; dip them, so as to be perfectly firee from dirt 
or insect, in fresh water, and cut in tolerably large 
pieces— not too large, however, for the most delicate 



nsH. 297 

montL Mix lobster^ sauce, and lettuce with a few turns 
of the spoon, but do not bury it in the liquid, and at the 
top let a small quantity of the crisp lettuce appear. 

There are various other modes of making lobster 
salads. Many prefer oil to cream ; and some, wanting 
oil or cream, even use melted butter, and add Worcester 
and other sauces. But I say, use cream. If, however, 
you prefer oil, as many do, then use it ; but, recollect, it 
must be first-rate, of the very finest Lucca. 

Lobster salads are also made in moulds, and a very 
elegant, nutritious, and agreeable addition they are on 
the supper-table. Hen Lobsters are decidedly preferable 
for this lady-like dish. It is merely placing a lobster 
salad in a mould decorated with gherkins or beetroot 
I have seen the leaves of the damask-rose added in re- 
fined houses. Let it be well frozen, and turned out of 
the mould only a short time previous to being placed on 
the table. This dish, in all respects to be approved of, 
should be prepared by a skilful hand. 

Lobster Curry. [Idem.] Lay the meat, not too 
small, in a pan, with real gravy and cream at discretion, 
following the rules of art and good taste. The excellence 
of any dish depends upon this and the high class of the 
material used ; bad curry-powder, and stale lobster, with 
thin cream, cannot possibly produce the desired effect 
Then rub with butter two teaspoonfiils of curry-powder 
— ^if not powerfiil, three : put them into a pan and sim- 
mer for an hour, adding a soupfon of cayenne and salt 
Half a glass of first-rate sherry or madeira will add to

without the addition of any yinons or other excitement. 
Some add maoe and lemon, and perhaps they are right. 
If so, I am wrong : I eschew them.

materials, the groundwork being a fresh lobster, good 
thick cream, and first-rate cony-powder, with the hand 
of art to mix. 

A Gratin of Lobster, A [Idem], is an artistic dish, 
requiring genius, thought, and consideration to make it 
presentable at a table where refinement of eating takes 
the place of gluttony, or the mere satisfying the appetite ; 
while beauty reigns at the board, and conversation vies 
with the sparkling champagne. It may be thus produced : 

Procure the finest and freshest of lobsters possible ; 
cut it in halves, detaching the head from the body ; take 
out all the meat, and save the shells ; cut the meat into 
slices, then put a teaspoonful of chopped shallots in a 
stew-pan, with a piece of butter the size of two walnuts ; 
pass them a few minutes over the fire ; add a teaspoonful 
of flour, well mixed with half a pint of milk, and stir 
over the fire, boiling about five minutes. Then add the 
lobster, which season with a little cayenne, salt, chopped 
parsley, and essence of anchovies. Set it again on the 
fire, stirring until boiling ; then stir in the yolk of an 
egg ; take off the fire ; fill the shells of the lobster ; 
sprinkle bread-crumbs over it, with a little butter ; put 
in the oven twenty minutes, and serve. To give it a 
nice colour, use tlie salamander. 

No one ought to sit down before this dish without 
care and the power of abstaining. 



Grratin of Lobster j B. Split the lobster down its 
whole length, if possible, withoat detaching the shell of 
the head from that of the tail. 

Pick out all the white meat of the body (not the tail) 
and the claws; mix it with the green curd, and the 
coral (if any) minced fine, and the spawn (first well 
washed, and then crushed in a mortar). Put these in a 
saucepan with a bit of butter, a dust of flour, pepper, 
pounded mace, a glass of good red wine, and a teaspoon- 
ful of essence of anchovies. Slice the two halves of the 
tail, add tliem to the above, and warm together over th& 
fire, stirring carefully. With this ragoiit fill the two 
entire half-shells of your lobster. Dust bread-crumbs 
or biscuit-raspings over all, and brown in a brisk oven^ 
or under a salamander. 

N.B. Cookery-Books in general make more of lob- 
ster-spawn than it is worth. It is almost always full of 
sand or grit, wliich spoils every combination into which 
it enters ; and to get rid of which, it is obliged to be so* 
thoroughly and repeatedly washed, that the little flavour 
it has is washed out of it too. It is then good only 
to please the eye, plague the teeth, and defy the diges- 
tion. 

Boasted Lobster. Boil your lobster until half done ;. 
take it out of the water, and as soon as it has drained,, 
and the shell is dry, rub it all over with sweet fresh 
butter. Set it in an American oven before the fire, and 
continue basting with butter until enougli. For sauce^ 
take the butter left in the latch-pan, and mix with it a 
little mustard and vinegar.

more thoroughly. 

Wash and pick them over carefully, to get lid of 
foreign substances. Throw them, alive, into boiling salt 
and water. K sea-water is used, it must first stand to 
settle. Let them boil about ten minutes, skimming 
well. Take out two or three with a spoon, to try if they 
are enough.

JEcfGS on their DisL Heat in tho oven of your cook- 
ing-stove, or in an American oven, a large dinner-plate 
or small dish. Smear it well with a lump of sweet butter, 
the remains of which you may leave to melt in the dish. 
Then break into it very carefully, and one by one, so as 
not to break tho yolks, as many eggs as, lying side by 
side, and not one upon the otlier, will fill the dish inside 
its rim. Sprinkle over each egg a dust of pepper and 
salt, and return it to the oven, which must not be fierce. 
Watch its progress ; as soon as all the whites are set, it 
is done. A few moments under a red-hot salamander 
insures the eggs being cooked as completely at their 
upper as at their under surface. Serve in the dish in 
which the eggs are cooked, placed in another, or on a 
small tray or heat-proof mat. They will take from six 
to ten minutes. 

To Boil Eggs for Weak Stcmmclis, Put the eggs 
gently, with a spoon, into a deep saucepan nearly 
fall of water on the point of boiling. Let them boil ; 
take them off the fire immediately, and let them stand 
on the side of the stove for five minutes firom the time

of first putting them in. So done, they will be hard 
nowhere and raw nowhere. Eggs dropped into boiling 
water, and kept galloping three minutes and a half, 
or egg-glass time, will have the coating of white next 
the shell hxirdj while their centre is raw. Strong 
stomachs may indulge in boiled eggs which (if they were 
round) would serve for billiard-balls : or they may go 
to the hen-house, and enjoy them as offered by the hen ; 
but either of those states are too heavy for the invalid. 

I have seen cooks (Good Plain) cook eggs in a 
pipkin, with just enough water to half-cover them, and 
whose scanty quantity is soon still further diminished by 
evaporation. They thus solve the curious problem, 
^^ How to serve boiled eggs with one side hard and the 
other raw." 

Eggs which stand upright in tlie water are either 
not fresh, or are cracked and leaky. They may be used, 
perhaps, in salad or sauce, but cannot appear as Boiled 
Eggs. 

Poached Eggs. Have a large, deep stew-pan, three- 
parts full of boiling salt-and- water. Crack the shells of 
your eggs, one by one, on the edge of the stew-pan ; hold 
them over the boiling water and close to its surface, open 
the shell adroitly with your two timmbs, and let its con- 
tents slip into the water in as entire a mass as possible. 
Keep each egg separate in the water, to prevent their 
sticking together. If the yolk of an egg is broken, it is 
spoilt for serving. Take off the scum as it rises, other- 
wise the stew-pan will boil over. 

Poached eggs require some nicety. Their whites

must be more set than in eggs boiled or in eggs on their 
dish; for if not firm enough^ they will have a sloppy 
appearance; and yet the yolks should not be hanL 
Take out with a fish-slice or skimmer, in which let them 
well drain before serving ; which is done in various ways. 

Poached eggs may be laid each on a slice of buttered 
toast; or on a bed of chopped cabbage (early York, 
Savoy, or red), and surrounded with boiled sausages; 
or on a mixture of sorrel and spinach, trimmed round 
with toast or fried bread-dice ; or seasoned witli pepper, 
vinegar, and butter. 

Matelote of Eggsy or Poaclied Eggs in Wine. Put 
into a stew-pan a pint or more of vin ordmairey or of 
better wine diluted with water. Add pepper, salt, bunch 
of sweet herbs, an onion sliced, and a clove of garlic 
split Boil five minutes, remove the flavouring ma- 
terials, and poach eight or ten eggs in the liquor, as 
above. When done, arrange them on tlieir dish. 
Thicken the liquor by continually stirring in a lump of 
butter, rubbed into a spoonful of flour. Let it just boil 
up, and pour it over the eggs by way of sauce. You 
may add a few shrimps, shell-fish, or ready-cooked 
pieces of eel or other fish. 

Maslied Eggs, Put a little good gravy or dripping 
fi'om roast beef, veal, or pork, or a little good soup, or 
a large lump of butter, into a stew-pan. Throw on 
the top of this five or six eggs, breaking them imme- 
diately with a fork, and stirring constantly. Season 
slightly with pepper and salt, and cook quite gently and 
moderately.

Wh3e cooking, a few bits of ready-cooked vegetables 
. — such as green peas, asparagus-tops, sprigs of cauli- 
flower, or mushrooms, or a little chopped parsley — ^may 
be thrown in. 

This dish, though only a rudimental omelette, or an 
excuse for one, is light, agreeable, and readily prepared. 
A simpler form of it is — 

Egg Toast, Have ready some hot buttered toast 
cut into quarters of rounds, according to the quantity 
required. Put a saucepan on the Are with some butter 
in it. As soon as melted, for a small dish break half a 
dozen eggs into the saucepan, with a little salt, and stir 
them well with a fork, all the while they are on the fire, 
from five to ten minutes, according to its briskness. 
Lay a good table-spoonful of the eggs on each piece of 
toast, and serve. 

Fried Eggs. Have your deep fiying-pan half-full 
of hot fat Drop your eggs into it, as for poaching* 
They will cook more rapidly than in water. Eggs fried 
in a shallow pan, with a scant of fat, are brown under- 
neath, while they are still raw above. 

For fried eggs and bacon, fry the bacon firstj and 
then tlie eggs; it will be better still, if you can grill the 
rashers of bacon or ham while you are fiying the eggs. 

Eggs Fried in Batter. Poach your eggs (not hard) ; 
set them aside to drain and cool on a clean napkin. 
Make ready your deep fiying-pan ; when the fat is hot, 
firy enough parsley to cover the bottom of your dish. 
Dip your eggs in batter with a spoon, sprinkle them 
slightly with fine-chopped parsley, and fry. When a

nice light brown, they are enough. Arrange them on 
the bed of fried parsley, and sprinkle with a little lemon- 
jnice. N.B. When fried eggs are wanted for garnish- 
ing (hashed calf's head, sausages, &c.), they ai'e more 
sightly done in this way. 

Other receipts for cooking eggs not hard, are little 
more than variations of the above. Eggs a la Bonne 
Femme — Good Wonian^s Eggs — are Eggs on tJieir Dish, 
surrounded by fried sausages and seasoned with pepper 
and vinegar. Piedmontese Eggs are the same, lying on 
a bed of bread-crumbs and thinly sliced cheese. Pro^ 
rengal Eggs are Poached Eggs with garlic and anchovy 
sauce. 

Receipts for serving Iiard eggs are not given here, 
but separately by themselves at the end of the Chapter, 
as a warning that they are better suited to the stomachs 
of ostriches tlian of invalids. A curious fancy, worthy 
of the olden time, is the making of a Monster Egg^ by 
separating the yolks and the whites of a number of eggs, 
cooking all the former together in a bladder, so as to 
form one big yolk, and tlien cooking that in another 
bladder, surrounded by all the whites. Such an egg 
may amuse the eye, but it would afford but little amuse- 
ment eitlier to tlie palate or the stomach, with whatever 
sauce it may be sensed surrounded. 

Clieesey Eggs. Take a piece of Gruyere, Stilton, 
Cottenham, or other good white cheese, the third of the 
weight of the eggs you are going to use, and half its 
weight of butter. Beat up the eggs in a stew-pan, set 
it on the fire, throw in the cheese (grated or sliced very

thin) and the butter. Season with pepper ; the addition 
of salt must depend upon the saltness of tlie cheese. 
Keep stirring continually until the whole becomes a thick 
succulent mass. Serve on a thin slice of toast on a hot 
dish. N.B. The toast may be very thinly spread with 
essence of anchovy or potted meat or fish. 

Eggs and Gravy — (Evfs au Jus, I was one day 
travelling with a couple of ladies, whom I was conduct- 
ing to Melun. We had not started very early in the 
morning, and we reached Montgeron with an appetite 
which threatened to clear away every thing before it 

Vain menaces ! The inn where we halted, altliougk 
respectable enough in outside appearance, did not con- 
tain a scrap of provisions. Three diligences and twe 
post-chaises had passed that way, and, like the Egyptian 
locusts, had clean devoured ever}'- thing. So said the 
Clief^ the Head of the Kitchen — Anglic^y Man-Cook. 

Nevertheless, I beheld a slowly turning spit laden 
with a perfectly comme il faut leg of mutton, at which 
the ladies, out o( mere habit, directed their most coquet- 
tish glances. Tlieir smiles, alas ! were misdirected. 
The mutton belonged to three Englishmen, who had 
brought it with them, and who, impatiently waiting for 
it, were beguiling the time with a bottle of champagne. 

" But at least," I said to him, with an air of com- 
bined annoyance and supplication, "could you not let 
us have these few eggs done in the mutton gravy? With- 
the eggs and a cup of cream-and-coffee, we will tiy and 
bear our lot with resignation." 

"With all my heart," replied the Chef. "The 



J 



EGGS: DIGESTIBLE. 307 

gravy is my perquisite by the Law of Nations ; I will 
arrange yonr afiair immediately." So saying, he set to 
work to break the eggs with due precaution. 

When his attention was otherwise engaged, I stealthily 
drew near the fire, took out my pocket travelling knife, 
and inflicted on the forbidden mutton a dozen deep 
wounds, through which the gravy could not help flowing 
to the very last drop. I followed up this first operation 
by superintending the concoction of the eggs, lest any 
little accident should occur to our prejudice. As soon 
as they were done to a nicety, I took possession of them, 
and carried them oif to the room where our table was 
laid. 

There we enjoyed our impromptu treat, laughing like 
mad at the idea that we were in reality swallowing the 
substance of the mutton, leaving to our English friends 
the task of chewing the residue. — Brillat Savarin. 

Scambled Eggs (American), Put in a spider (a sort 
of fiying-pan) enough sweet butter to oil the bottom of 
the pan. Put in the eggs without breaking the yolks. 
Add a bit of butter as large as a walnut for every dozen 
eggs; season with very little salt and pepper. When 
the whites harden a little, stir the eggs from the bottom 
of the spider, and continue to do tliis until cooked to 
suit the family. When done, the yolks and whites should 
be separate^ although stirred together — marbled, in fact 
— and not mixed like mashed eggs. 

" Preserved Eggs,^ says Cobbett, " are thmgs to run 
from J not after." They often are so ; but in any case 
many dishes which cannot be made without eggs are not 



308 eggs: digestible. 

things to run from ; and therefore preserved eggs must 
be had, unless you mean to disappoint the young folk of 
tlieir Christmas plum-pudding. In Norfolk, eggs are 
saved from putrefaction by immersion in lime-water, to 
which some housewives add salt. Cooks say they answer 
their purpose ; but they are quite uneatable as eggsj and 
only not offermve to the smell. 

R^umur's experiments with varnish appear to have 
succeeded ; but varnished eggs would be too troublesome 
for preserving on an extensive scale. At St Kilda, 
where the inhabitants subsist on the eggs of sea-fowl 
during several months of the year, they preserve them in 
stone pyramids, scattering turf-ajshes under and about 
them, " to defend them from the Air, dryness being tlieir 
only Preservative, and moisture tlieir Consumption" 
(MartirCs Voyage to tlie Island of St, KUda: London, 
1698). Later travellers inform us tliat the same system 
still continues to be practised. 

The shells of these sea-birds' eggs are more fragile 
than those of the common hen, which circumstance 
must cause them to be more difficult to preserve ; and 
turf-ashes clearly make a sweeter and more effectual 
packing than lime-water, or the means usually adopted 
in England. But they are only to be had in certain 
localities; and wood-ashes are too light, and cinder- 
ashes too loose, to exclude the air. The Lish plan of 
smearing fresh-laid eggs with butter answers well for a 
limited time, but is insufficient to keep them through the 
winter. The method I have found to succeed best, and 
recommend, is to dip each egg into melted pork-lard.

rubbing it into the shell with your finger, and then to 
pack them in an old fig-drum or butter-firkin, setting 
every egg upright, ivith the small end downwards. Eggs 
thus prepared in August, directly after harvest, have 
been boiled and eaten with relish by myself and family 
in the following January. They were not like the eggs 
we were used to in spring ; but they were much better 
than any kept eggs we could buy. 

Omelettes,* in general, are composed so very nearly 
of eggs alone (with the addition of what may be con- 
sidered mere flavouring matters), that their place is 
quite as appropriate hero as amongst Made Dishes or 
Sweets. They deserve, however, their foil share of atten- 
tion ; for they are light, nutritious, quickly prepared ; 
and few things are more likely to please a delicate 
appetite than a nice, hot, juicy, big-bellied omelette, 
cooked to a second. 

Plain Omelette, Break into a bowl as many eggs as 
you think will be required ; firom six to eight will make 
a convenient-sized dish. Season them with fine salt, add 
a little water or milk, and beat them up well. The more 
you beat them, the lighter your omelette will be. Melt 
some butter in a frying-pan or omelette-pan — the best 
utensil for the purpose is one of the French coarse 
earthenware stew-pans or casseroles^ which are lined 

* The etymology of the word omelette has puzzled many. (Euf 
(plural cmfa) is French for *' egg," and miler for " to mix or mingle." 
Now, in a Tolume of the Thiatre Italien, printed in 1692, the word is 
spelt ceumelette, and not omelette, evidently meaning aufs-meUt, ^' eggs 
mixed together ;'* so corresponding with the definition given hy the 
abbreviated Dictionary of the Academie : ** Omelette ; egg^ beaten 
together, and cooked in the frying-pan with butter or bacon.''

Salmon Omelette. [This excellent formula is Brillat 
Savarin's famous Omelette au Thouy acclimated to Great 
Britain and Ireland.] Take, for six persons, two carp 
{or mackarel) milts ; wash them well in cold water, and 
then plunge them for five minutes into boiling water^ 
with a little salt in it 

Take, also, a piece of fresh-boiled salmon as big as a 
hen's egg ; add to it a small shallot already minced to 
atoms. Chop up the milts with the salmon, so as to mix 
them well together, and throw the whole into a saucepan 
with a sufficiency of butter to sauter them until the butter 
is melted, and no more tJmn melted. Herein consists the 
.speciality of the omelette. If fried or boiled in the 

• 

butter, they are hardened, and refuse to mingle with the 

Now take at discretion a second lump of butter ; 
blend it with chopped parsley and chives, or green spring 
onions ; put it in a deep, oval, fish-shaped dish, which is 
destined to receive your omelette; pour (not squeeze) 
.some lemon-juice over it, and set the dish on your hot 
iron plate, or on hot ashes. 

Beat up a dozen eggs (the fresher the better) ; then 
■add to them the sautM milts and salmon, and stir until 
they are equally mixed together. Then cook your 
omelette in the usual way, doing your very best to keep 
it long, thick, soft, spongy, and succulent. Overdoing 
will ruin it. Transfer it skilfully to the hot dish prepared 
to receive it; serve at once, and cause it to be eaten 
forthwith. 

This dish should be reserved for delicate repasts, for

meetings of amateurs who know what they are abont? 
and who never eat as if they were afraid of missing the 
train. Take, on the top of it, a glass of good old wine, 
and yoa shall see what you shall see — something 
delectable and marvellons. 

Cold'Fish Omelette (a useful formula, on account of 
its great adaptability and versatility). Warm in a 
saucepan scraps of cold turbot, sole, whiting, lobster, or 
any other delicate fish, with any remnant you may 
happen to have of anchovy, lobster, shrimp, or oyster 
sauce. Let there be only just enough sauce to moiste^i 
the fish, not to flood or drown it. 

As in the preceding receipt, braid up, with a good- 
sized lump of butter, a little chopped parsley, and green 
spring onions. Put it, when done, into a deep oval dish, 
into which the omelette is to go ; add the juice of a 
lemon, and set it on your hot plate, to melt and warm 
thoroughly. 

Put the yolks of a dozen eggs into one bowl, and the 
whites into another. Season the yolks with a teaspoonful 
of mixed pepper and salt, and beat them up well. Then 
beat up the whites till they are quite in a fix)th. Then 
mix all together, whites and yolks. By this method the 
omelette cannot fail to be light — a most important point 

For the frying, put your earthen pan on the fire, 
and in the pan a lump of butter — a pood lump of butter, 
nearly half a pound ; you need not waste it afterwards. 
" You can't make an omelette without breaking eggs,'* 
Raid the Duke of Malakofi^ when he took the Tower ; 
" You can't frj' an omelette without melting butter," the 



EGGS : DIGESTIBLE. . 313 

Doctor says. Keep your omelette stimng in tlie bowl, 
and as soon as the butter is hot and a little brown, pour 
it in. Then drive your locomotive gently ; don't catch 
fire, and don't stick by tlie w^ay at the edges. Ease it up 
all round with your slice, and keep it shifting from side 
to side, and backwards and forwards, just a little. It 
will soon be of a bright golden colour beneath, although 
vou cannot see its under surface. It should now be as 
round as a full moon, and a little stifiPer than a good firm 
custard. Put in the middle of it, with a spoon, a suffi- 
cient quantity of your warmed-up fish. Then double it 
in two, so as to make it into a half-moon. Leave it a 
few moments, to allow the two surfaces to unite at their 
edges. Remove it cleverly into your hot receiving dish 
with the oiled parsley and butter at the bottom, where it 
should present the inviting appearance of a plump, light, 
juicy, tender, long-shaped, savoury, semi-solid lump of 
delicacy. 

Sweet Omelette J A. Beat up the eggs as for tlie 
Plain Omelette, previously adding to them finely minced 
lemon-peel and powdered lump-sugar. Fry, and serve 
on a hot dish, well dusted with powdered sugar. Then 
dust the omelette itself with sugar; set it under the 
salamander for a minute ; or, for want of that, crisp its 
upper surface with a red-hot shovel ; or score it in lines, 
herring-bone fashion, by a red-hot poker held close to it. 
This omelette may also be flavoured witli orange-flower 
water, rose-water, noyau, &c. 

Fruit-preserve Omelette, Proceed, as directed for the 
Sweet Omelette ; only, before beating the eggs, add to 



'314 eggs: digestible. 

them a sufficiency of fruit-preserve or jam to give flavour 
without too much weakening the consistency. Finish off 
in the same way. 

Strawberry Omelette. Beat up a dozen eggs, whites 
.and yolks separately, frothing the whites as for the cold- 
fish omelette. But mix with the yolks, instead of salt, a 
bumping table-spoonful of pounded lump-sugar. Be- 
member that, as pepper and salt give the tone to a 
savoury omelette, so sugar gives the tone to a preserve 
•or fruit omelette. Fry and manipulate as with the Cold- 
Fish Omelette. At ilie proper time, put into it a liberal 
^allowance — four bumping spoonfuls — of strawberry jam, 
in which the strawberries are whole. Let the jam lie a 
minute in the open omelette to get well warm through ; 
then double the whole into a half-moon, keeping the 
jam well tucked up inside. Dish it; and dust it well 
at top with a snow-shower of tlie whitest sugar you 
have. 

Rum Omelette. Beat a dozen eggs exactly as before, 
•only putting an extra dose of sugar to the yolks. Fry, 
keeping it as light as possible ; for this omelette ought to 
melt in the mouth, stimulate the stomach, and calm the 
nerves. Heat a deeper dish than the one used for the 
Strawberry Omelette. Warm cautiously in a pipkin a 
tumbler or a tumbler and half of the best old Jamaica 
rum until it is lukewarm. Double the omelette : dish 
it; dust thickly with sugar; slii) it under the red-hot 
salamander, not too close to the iron, and watch. ^VTien 
the dust sugar is converted into an orange-brown crust 
of sugar-barley, it is done. Just outside the dining-

room door, pour the warm rum into tho dish, set fire to 
it, and serve blazing. 

Any one who lias made and succeeded with the 
above, will have no difficulty in executing any other 
omelette from the mere indication of its contents. Ome- 
lettes may be made to enclose in their substance preserved 
ginger and candied citron-peel; bacon or ham cut small; 
cheese ; bread cut into dice and fried ; the same mixed 
with shi'eds of anchovy or Yarmouth bloaters ; shrimps, 
prawns, or oysters; asparagus-tops, green peas, sorrel, 
and other vegetables, either singly or all mixed in a 
ragoftt, then called it la Jardiniire. A macedoine^ or 
medley, of omelettes, consists in making — instead of one 
large omelette filled witli one kind of preserve — several 
small ones, each containing a different kind of fruit-jam, 
4md all served together on the same dish. 

Sweet Omelette^ B (English receipt). Beat up the 
yolks of four eggs with four spoonfuls of cream ; sweeten 
to your taste with fine white sugar. Beat the whites to 
a strong frotli ; add tliem to the yolks, and mix well just 
before you are going to fry. When well set, lay on the 
sweetmeat, whatever it may be; such as preserved 
apricots, raspberry jam, or currant jelly. A large table- 
spoonful will be sufficient for an omelette of this size. It 
should be laid on in a lump rather than spread about. 
Fold one half of the omelette over the other, as if you 
were doubling a slice of bread-and-butter. Dust sugar 
over it, and send to table on a napkin. N.B. The 
quicker an omelette is made and cooked, the lighter it 
is sure to turn out. It should appear on the table tho

instant after it is out of the pan; and it is better that the 
guests should wait two minutes for it^ than it should wait 
half a minute for them. 

Savoury Omelette (English). Beat the yolks of four 
eggs ; add a little onion chopped very fine, and a little 
minced parsley. Beat the whites to a strong froth ; 
mix all together ; season with pepper and salt, and fry. 
Double it in two when nearly enough ; give it another 
minute's firying, and serve on a hot dish, w*ith a little 
good gravy poured over it 

Savoury omelettes, as has been suggested, may be 
varied to a great extent They may be flavoured with 
different kinds of herbs, such as a few pinches of dried 
and powdered sage, or knotted marjoram and sweet 
basil, or chives and chervil minced exceedingly fine 
together, instead of onions and parsley. Or, leaving 
out the herbs entirely, the omelette may contain cold 
veal or other meat cut into dice. Minced meat is less 
commonly used than herbs, but is oft«n convenient to 
make a change for persons who require a light, nutritious 
diet. 

Omelette Sovfflie, The success of this will mainly de- 
pend on the beating of the eggs, and the steady briskness 
of the oven. Separate the whites and yolks of half a 
dozen eggs. Flavour the yolks with orange-flower water, 
vanilla, or any thing else that is delicate ; sweeten with 
sugar rubbed on the rind of a lemon ; add a small tea- 
spoonful of flour and a table-spoonful of cream, and beat 
all welL Next beat the whites to a froth, and mix the 
whole together lightly.

Have ready a deep, open dish battered in the inside — 
a silver or plated one is the best, because the souffle 
must be served in the dish in which it is cooked — pour 
in your omelette ; set it in the oven immediately. When 
well raised and , browned, it is ready, and must be 
instantly transferred to the dining-table, previously 
dusted with sugar, for you can see it fall with every 
moment's delay. Indeed, the grand merit of an omelette 
soufflde consists less in its flavour (which should be 
slight) than its hotness and puffy, swollen proportions. 
The Parisian restaurants require at least twenty minutes' 
notice before serving this particular dish. 

Eggs a la Neige^ or Snowy Eggs. Put a pint of milk 
into a wide, shallow stew-pan, with three ounces of lump- 
sugar. Flavour with vanilla, or with a dessert-spoonful 
of orange-flower water, or two dessert-spoonfuls of rose 
water. When on the point of boiling, set it aside on 
your cooking-stove, keeping it hot 

Take half a dozen eggs ; put the whites into one bowl 
and the yolks into anoilier. Sprinkle a little powdered 
lump-sugar on the whites, and beat them with a whisk 
(either of tinned iron wire or of white osier-twigs— even 
a fork will do) until they rise into a strong, stiff froth. 
It is with this frotli tliat you are to make your snow. 
In summer, beat it in the coolest convenient place. 

Have ready at hand (cold) the large flat porcelain 
dish in which your Eggs a la Jfeige are to be served. 

Set your stew-pan witli the milk on the fire again. 
When near the boiling point, throw into it, one by one, 
large table-spoonfuls of your frothed white of eggs. The

bigger you can make them, to keep together, the more- 
effective will be the appearance of your dish. Turn 
them over in the hot milk with a ladle or fish-slice kept 
for the purpose, so as to cook their whole surface regularly 
throughout. When done, take up, a^d arrange them 
neatly on your porcelain dish, leaving small spaces 
between each lump or pile of snow. 

Lastly, break up your yolks, diluting them with a 
spoonful or two of milk, and with them gradually 
thicken the milk remaining in your saucepan, stirring 
well to prevent knots, and not allowing it to boil, in order 
to avoid " quailing" and hardening of the yolk. 

Pour this, not overj but between your lumps of snowy 
eggs, which should represent icebergs standing amidst 
a yellow sea. The whole, nicely executed, makes an 
ornamental sweet or supper dish, very agreeable to most 
palates, as well as light and easy of digestion. With care 
and neatness, it is not difficult to make, and is an 
elegant addition either to a third course or to a supper. 
A dozen eggs and half a pound of sugar are commonly 
used for a pint of milk.

butter. Fill the hollows of the whites of es& with this 
mixture, and serve as hot as possible. 

Some kind of sauce may be poured over the whole,, 
such as Dutch Sauce, or Parsley and Butter. 

Effff8 stuffed tcith Parsley are prepared exactly as 
above, except that chopped parsley is substituted for the 
anchovies, and pepper and salt are added. 

Effffs vnth Tomato Sauce, or White Sauce. Cut hard- 
boiled eggs into halves or quarters ; arrange them on a 
dish, and pour over them Tomato Sauce, or White 
Sauce. 

Eggs a VAllemande — German fasliioru Put a largo- 
tumbler of milk into a saucepan, with butter, pepper, 
salt, and chopped parsley. Give it a boil up, and then^ 
throw in hard eggs cut across in slices. Let tliem stew 
ten minutes, and serve. 

Eggs a la Tripe — Tripe fashion. Fry chopped onions 
brown in butter and flour, and then dilute with a little* 
good stock. When the onions are cooked, put in hard 
eggs cut in slices; let them sauter; season with pepper 
and salt and a dash of vinegar, and serve. 

Curried Eggs. Fry sliced onions brown in butter, 
add a dust of flour, and dilute with stock.

this some milk or cream until it is of tlie thickness of 
batter. Work this up smoothly with tlie fried onions, 
regulating with stock tlie quantity and consistency of the 
whole. When all is nicely blended, warm up in it your 
hard-boiled eggs, which may be either whole, halved, 
quartered, or sliced. The best appearance will be given 
to the dish by a judicious proportion of all those forms. 
When they are nicely arranged or piled, the curry ragoClt 
can be poured over them. 

Curried eggs ought to be accompanied by a dish of 
boiled rice, if only to give the stomach something to feed 
upon. 

Eggs a la Poulette. Put into a stew-pan a tumbler 
of milk, with a bit of butter, pepper and salt, and a little 
chopped parsley. Boil up, and, ten minutes before you 
want to serve, throw in hard eggs cut across in slices. 
A few button mushrooms are a nice addition ; you may 
also put in from the first an onion or two, which you will 
take out before servmg. 

Take up the sUces of egg witli a spoon : arrange them 
on tlie dish ; thicken the sauce with a dust of arrowroot, 
and pour it over them. 

Eggs a la Mattre iV Hotels A. Cut hard eggs in 
quarters ; arrange them in a dish that will stand die fire ; 
put bits of butter amongst them here and there. Chop 
some parsley, with which may be mixed a small propor- 
tion of tarragon, chervil, or chives ; sprinkle it over the 
eggs, with pepper and salt Set the dish on tlie hot plate 
or in a gentle oven, till the butter is completely melted 
and warmed, and turn the eggs without breaking them. 



EOGS: INDIQESTIBLIL 321 

EggB a la Mattre d^Hotel^ B. Make a T»hite roux, 
and cook in it some chopped onions, without letting 
them brown ; or take some white sauce made of flour, 
milk, and butter, and cook the onions in that, seasoning 
with pepper and salt. Throw in a little fine-chopped 
parsley (let the sauce be quite hot when this is done) ; 
add a fresh lump of butter, and the juice of a lemon. 
When these are well blended, warm up in them the hard 
eggs cut in pieces, and serve as hot as possible. 

Eggs a VAurcre — Dagmar^ or Daybreak Eggs; perhaps 
from their golden or orange-brown colour. Boil a* dozen 
eggs hard ; when cold, take off the shells, and cut them 
in halves. Take out the yolks, and pound them in a 
mortar with three raw yolks, and a quarter of a pound 
of butter ; add pepper and salt, grated nutmeg, grated 
crumb of bread, and enough cream to moisten them. 

Fill the empty whites of egg with this stufiBng in 
such a way that the cut surface shall be entirely covered ; 
butter the bottom of a dish that will stand the fire, and 
cover it with a thin layer of the stufiing ; on this arrange 
your half-eggs, with the convex or round part down- 
wards ; heat up in a gentle oven, and colour the upper 
surface brightly under a salamander. You may encircle 
the dish, as garnishing, with little patties, small strips of 
toast, or fried pai*sley. 

Eggs en Surprise — Eggs Surprised. Poach your eggs 
in water, without doing them hard ; then let them steep 
for several hours in lemon-juice, salt, and chopped 
parsley. 

When wanted, take them out to drain ; dip them ia.

frying batter (p. 75) ; sprinkle them with stale bread- 
crumbs, crushed biscuit, or French roll-raspings; fry 
them two or three at a time in a deep pan with plenty 
of hot fat, till they are a light bright brown, and serve 
on a bed of fried parsley. 

This dish, if careftdly managed, need not be so very 
hard or indigestible ; it is, moreover, convenient and 
nice-looking, t/* delicately executed. 

Eggs au Surprise — Surprising Eggs. The number of 
eggs must depend on the size of your dish ; a dozen will 
be enough for a party of eight or ten. Boil them hard, 
cut them in halves, take out the yolks, which pound in 
a mortar with a quarter of a pound of butter, cream, 
pepper and salt, grated nutmeg, a very few bread- 
crumbs, and two raw eggs. 

Then pare out the insides of the whites, till they are 
as thin as they will hold together without breaking; 
save these parings. Fill half the number of the hollowed 
whites with the above prepared stuffing. Mix fine- 
chopped parsley with what remains, and with it fill the 
rest of the whites. 

Chop the parings of the hollowed whites, and mix 
tliem with the remainder of the stuffing, which lay as a 
bed or a mound at the bottom of a metal or earthenware 
dish that will stand the fire. 

Clap together, two by two, the difierently stuffi3d 
half-eggs, making them apparently whole again; and 
arrange them symmetrically on the mound of stuffing. 
Set tliem into a gentle oven, and serve as soon as they 
are well hot through.

Egg Piesy Penitential^ for Lent. Boil a dozen eggs 
hard, and chop them fine. Add to them abont the same 
weight (in all) of butter, sugar, well- washed currants, 
and bread-crumbs. Moisten with white wine, and season 
with pounded cinnamon and mace. These Egg Pies 
may be made like mince pies, in larger or smaller patty- 
pans. 

JEgg Patties. Crush the yolks and mince the whites 
of half a dozen hard-boiled eggs. Mix these thoroughly 
with the crumb of a penny roll soaked in milk or eream, 
a quarter of a pound of butter, a table-spoonful of fine- 
chopped parsley, pepper and salt, or other spice to 
taste. Beat all these together till they form a tolerably 
liquid paste, which can be diluted with cream, if too stifil 

Put a sufiicient quantity of this mixture into tartlets 
or patties made of pufi'-paste, and bake in a smart oven. 

Hard Eggs in Clear Jelly. Common eggs, like those 
of the hen, will rarely be served with the honours of 
Jelly, which will be reserved for those of the Guinea 
fowl, the plover, the rook, the sea-gull, the water-hen, 
and such-like oval delicacies — the whites of several of 
which remain semi-transparent after boiling. 

A clear jelly, rather highly seasoned, is made with 
calves* or pigs' feet. With this, a mould is partially 
filled ; when cold, the hard eggs are arranged in the jelly, 
and more liquid jelly poured over them. If tlie mould 
be large enough, there may be two strata of eggs. Let 
stand (all night, or longer) till the jelly has got quite 
firm and cold. To turn it out, dip the mould for an 
instant into a bucket of hot water.

Hard Egg SandwicJies speak for themselves. The 
slices of egg may be seasoned with pepper and salt, and 
relieved with a slight spread of essence of anchovy. A 
few bits of cress (garden or water) will also help them. 
But, of all known sandwiches, those of hard egg are, 
perhaps, the worst — ^not even excepting the five-pound 
note which the sailor at Portsmouth ate between bread- 
and-butter. 



HADE DISHES. 325 



MADE DISHES. 

A DISTINGUISHED French Ex-OfBcer of the Mouth has 
defined Mora dCCEuvre to be a kitchen term applied to 
every dish which people can do without, without in- 
juriously affecting the service of a dinner. It is, in 
fact, <m unnecessary. Cooks admit that you can dine 
without it quite as well; doctors may be inclined to 
think better. 

The same may be said of Made Dishes (EntrdeSj as 
they are called, in the classical language of cookery) ; 
they are interludes, divertiasements, between the serious 
acts of the real evening's performance. Those who are 
assembled with the full intention of mainly occupying 
themselves with it^ will be wise in paying but slight 
attention to the charms of its minor accessories. 

Nevertheless, Mado Dishes are valuable as a means 
of enabling cooked food to reappear in a novel and 
economical form ; they will often serve as the basis of a 
dinner, on quiet family occasions, hasty visits, friendly 
and unceremonious meetings, and, above all, for invalids, 
sedentary people, and patients recovering from a sharp 
stroke of illness. Large joints, cut-and-come-again 
pieces, are quite inappropriate to set before them; they 
want something light and tasty, which shall excite them 



326 liADE DISHES. 

to eat a little^ without making them feel afterwards a» 
if they had eaten too much. For it cannot be too often 
repeated, that the benefit derived from food depends 
not so much on the quantity of nutriment it contains^ as 
on the facility with which that nutriment is digested. 
Take Beef Tea, for instance ; the weight and bulk of the 
aliment we are able to find in it is very small indeed^ 
and yet, because it is easily assimilated, patients gain 
strength by taking it, who would be thrown back on 
their bed of sickness by an equal dose of strong Mock- 
Turtle or Ox-Tail Soup, containing twenty times the 
amount of nutritive matters. 

The present chapter will not contain a long list of 
Made Dishes, because they will be found scattered up 
and down the work, under the heads of the elements of 
which they are principally composed. A few, however^ 
which bear the mark of their own special individuality^ 
must be given, if only to show what may be done in 
this line — ^for every body seems to like Made Dishes, 
nicely prepared. From the weekly Scrap-and-Bone 
Pie at boarding-school, to the elegant French kickshaws 
a la Something-or^othery the seasoning and the stewing 
transmutes offal into delicacies; it is the sauce which 
causes the coarse fish to be eaten. As the Cardinal 
said, when afterwards told that he had eaten a bit of 
rope, believing it lamprey : " Never mind ; it's all one 
to mo. With the same sauce, I'd eat another." 

In proof of the favour and popularity which Made 
Dishes deservedly enjoy, we have only to adduce tho 
fact that many of them are also National Dishes, the 



HADE DISHBS 327 

babitual fare of millions of men. Witness the Irish 
Stews ; the Scotch Brose ; Sheep's Head and Trotters, 
and Haggis ; the OUa Podridas of Spain ; the Curries of 
India, and numerons others. 

The PiUawy for instance, is the national dish of 
the Persian, whom the Quarterly Review considers the 
Frenchman of the East, as far as cookery is concerned. 
Nor is it surprising that he should succeed in this art, 
when princesses study it, and are in the habit of bestow- 
ing upon favoured guests the triumphs of their skill. 

The Persian Pillaw is a dish of world-wide reputa- 
tion ; even their bitterest enemies, the Osmanli, admit 
its merit It is simply a dish of boiled rice, over which 
is poured melted butter or fat (^^ chillaw" is rice boiled 
simply), eaten with some preparation of meat or vege- 
tables. Consequently, the variety of pillaws is great; 
but the art — and one hitherto unattained, we are told, 
by either Turkish or European skill — consists in the 
boiling of the rice and the mixture of the melted butter. 
The process is probably as simple as that of boiling a 
plum-pudding — a secret which, somehow or another, 
does not appear to have been widely divulged on the 
other side of the Channel. Some French pastry-cooks 
still obstinately insist that haked plum-pudding is tlie 
right thing. 

In the dinners of the more refined inhabitants of 
Persian towns, a great variety of excellent stews, sea- 
soned with sauces (amongst which is a delicious prepa- 
ration of the juice of the pomegranate), accompany the 
boiled rice, served, however, to the guests on separate 



328 KABS DISHES. 

plates. The tribes and the poorer classes content them- 
selves with meat or fowls, plainly boiled, and placed in 
the centre of the steaming pillaw. Sometimes, on great 
occasions, almonds and raisins are mixed with the rice. 
The chiefs have huge platters, which two men can 
scarcely cany, in which the lamb, roasted whole, rests 
on a bed of pillaw. This is a festive dish, when the 
reception-hall is full of honoured guests. Sometimes, a 
monumental pillaw, of prodigious proportions, is brought 
into the room, and set before the guests by half a dozen 
men. In the centre of a mountain of rice, stained a 
bright yellow by saffiron, is a sheep, roasted whole. The 
pillaw itself is a blaze of light, thrown out by little 
wicks of cotton, floating in melted butter, contained in 
half-oranges, with their inside scooped out This is 
considered a triumph of cookery. 

Pillaw J of more modest and possible proportions than 
the above. Cut up a pound of breast of mutton into 
small pieces, and a quarter of a pound of fat bacon into 
dice. Brown them in a stew-pan in fresh butter, and 
then add gradually a quart of water ; let it stew until 
the mutton is half done. Then add a quarter of a pomid 
of well-washed rice, tliat has been previously steeped, 
with pepper, salt, cayenne, and bouquet complete. Let 
all simmer together gently, until the rice is tender, and 
your ragoiit thick enough to allow of its being piled on 
the dish in a heap. 

Surround this central pyramid of pillaw with several 
small ones, containing different kinds of meats (as fowl, 
pork, duck, veal), and diversely coloured ; yellow, with 



MADE DI8HES. 329 

saffron or turmeric; green, with spinach -juice; and 
red, with cochineal or beetroot-juice. 

Turkish PillcLWy with Meat Take one measure of 
rice (well washed in tepid water), and three measures of 
good broth ; set them over a brisk fire, in a stew-pan 
with a close-fitting lid. When it begins to boil, steep 
two or three threads of saffron (yery little suffices to 
give as much flavour as English palates can bear) in a 
teacupful of warm broth ; when well infused, pour it 
into your stew-pan, and let all boil, closely covered. 

When the rice is cooked, spread it on the dish. On 
this, lay a stratum of ragodt of any meat, or fowl, or 
game, you have. Cover with a stratum of plain-boiled 
rice, and pour over the whole a table-spoonful of fresh 
butter, oiled. 

Meager PUlaw. To one measure of well-washed 
rice, put three measures of water, with a pinch of salt. 
Omit the saffron, and boil till enough. Strain the rice, 
and spread it on the dish. On tliis, lay a stratum of 
mixed vegetables (whatever is in season), made into a 
ragoiit, thickened with cgg-yolk, and seasoned with 
pepper, salt, and cayenne. Cover with a stratum of 
plain-boiled rice, into which thrust five bits of butter as 
big as filberts. Glaze the top with white of egg ; set 
the dish in a brisk oven a few minutes, and serve. 

Vol^au'Vefit. The best way is to procure the 
standing puff-crust from a pastry-cook, making its in- 
tended contents at home. For, even if the cook succeed 
perfectly with her puff-paste, it is not every private 
family who possess an oven suitable for baking it well. 



330 MADE DISHES. 

Bakers' ovens glow with an equal heat ; whereas cook- 
ing-stove and iron ovens give out more heat on one side 
than on the other ; so that, even by frequent turning, it 
requires great care to make the crust rise equally. 

Making the crust of the Vol-au-Vent is one of the 
things which require to be seen done. It is thus per- 
formed. Boll out the lightest possible puff-paste to 
three-quarters of, or one inch in thickness. Lay it on 
an iron oven-plate. A saucepan-lid will serve to cut 
out the required circle. Trim away the rest of the 
paste, which will serve for patties or garnishing. Trace^ 
with a knife heated in hot water (to prevent the paste 
from sticking to it), a smaller inner circle within it, to 
form the lid of the Vol-au-Vent, leaving an edge about 
an inch broad, and making your knife penetrate to 
neai'ly half the thickness of the paste. The surface of 
the whole may be glazed with egg, or otherwise deco- 
rated. Put into a brisk oven ; when, if the puff-paste 
has been well made, the whole ought to rise to the 
height of three or four inches. Wlien well risen, and of 
a nice light brown, take out, lift tlie cover immediately, 
and with your knife remove the underdone paste or 
crumb within, leaving the hollow which is to receive 
your ragoM, and taking care not to make any leaks in 
it. But to accomplish this well is one of the nicest 
operations in pastry- cooking. 

Patties^ or Petits Patds^ of whatever kind, have their 
crust made in the same way as that for Vols-au-Vent, 
only on a smaller scale. A number of them may be 
baked at once on the same iron plate, placing them so 



HADE DISHES. 331 

as not to touch each other. When hollowed out, thej 
are filled with diverse contents; so forming oyster, 
lohster, minced-veal, minced-fowl, hare, and a variety 
of other patties. 

As a Vol-au-Vent may be made of any thmgj and 
must contain a variety of ingredients, most of which 
require previous preparation, it is an economical way of 
producing, in an elegant form, many little remnants 
which would otherwise be wasted. The housekeeper, on 
looking over the contents of her store-room, can often 
out of them compose an original Vol-au-Vent. There is 
scope for her inventive genius. Bits of cold fowl,, 
pigeon, meat, game, and forcemeat; unused oyster,, 
caper, shrimp, or anchovy sauce, &c. &c., will, with 
judicious additions, costing little, and a well-made, 
tastefully flavoured sauce, constitute a dish pleasing to> 
the eye as well as to the palate. You may thus turn to 
a useful purpose delicate joints of poultry, brains, bits- 
of veal ; the livers of chicken, ducks, or geese ; cocks'- 
combs and kidneys ; morsels of rabbit ; small birds, as 
larks; portions of sausage, stuffing, quenelles, boudins, 
and balls of &ied mincemeat; — any thing, in short, 
which you have at hand. Meat Vols-au- Vent may have 
their character varied by a sliglit predominance of mush- 
room or walnut ketchup ; Harvey's, Worcestershire, 
Beading, or other popular sauce; truffles, lemon-peel, 
/Or even a dash of curry powder. 

Again : Vols-au- Vent of Fish are excellent, being 
moreover serviceable for meager days. That o{ Shrimps 
is one of the best. But cold cod, cods' sounds and 



332 MADE DISHES. 

tongues, flakes of turbot, fillets of soles, pieces of eel, 
cockles, mussels, lobster, crayfish, crab, scallops, &c &c, 
will come in usefully. Meagre Vols-au-Vent may be 
made to diflfer fi'om each other by a slightly prevailing 
flavour of parsley, or of mustard and vinegar, of oysters, 
eels, or anchovy, the sauce in all cases retaining ita 
richness and smoothness. 

To almost any Vol-au-Vent you may add either 
oysters or mushrooms, or both. A few olives improve 
the more high flavoured. As an example of the general 
mode of proceeding, we give : 

Vol-au^Vent of Sweetbreads and Oysters, A fine 
Sweetbread will make enough for from ten to twelve 
persons. The ragoiit, when finished, may be divided 
between two Vols-au-Vent (as they are never made 
large), or saved till another day. 

Procure the Sweetbreads as fresh as possible ; if the 
same day on which the calf is slaughtered, so much the 
better. Put them immediately into cold water, where 
let them lie half an hour or so, to cleanse and whiten. 
Then throw them into boiling water, with a dessert- 
spoonfiil of salt thrown into it. Let them boil gallop- 
ing, well covered with the water, a quarter of an hour 
or twenty minutes, according to size, until they are 
enough, not too much, cooked. Take out, drain, let 
cool, and set aside in meat-safe or larder. They are 
now ready to be employed in any of the ways in which 
sweetbreads are served. 

For your Vol-au-Vent, then, take your cold 
sweetbread, prepared as above directed. Cut it into 



MADE DISHES. 333 

dice, which you are to salt, pepper, and dredge with 
flour. 

Have ready-opened in a basin two or three dozen 
oysters, according to size, with their beards on, and all 
their liquor; also a small teacupful of button mush- 
rooms ; also the flesh of two dozen olives, pared as you 
would pare an orange all in one piece, only as tliick as 
possible, and close to the kernel ; which kernels you 
throw away. 

Into your stew-pan put a quarter of a pound of 
butter; melt it; add a good table-spoonful of flour, 
stirring well, and pouring in stock gradually, until your 
sauce attains a creamy consistency. Season with salt, 
pepper, or cayenne, and a very little dust of nutmeg. 

Put in your sweetbreads, stirring continually, for 
fear of their burning or browning. When thorougldy 
heated and done enough, add, one after the other, your 
oysters, mushrooms, and olives, a glass of madeira, 
marsala, or sherry, and a table-spoonful of tarragon or 
other aromatised vinegar. Stir and heat up again, 
taking great care not to let it boil. Taste if sufficiently 
highly seasoned, and serve in the Vol-au-Vent crust, 
after gently warming it. 

Many people like Vols-au-Vent quite as well cold as 
hot, or even better, as being less rich. Cold Vol-au- 
Vent makes a nice supper dish, and is just as produce- 
able as cold oyster patties or cold veal pie. 

Altliough we are not yet treating of Sweet Dishes, it 
is still an appropriate opportunity to mention a very 
agreeable and elegant variety of the above ; namely, 



334 MADE DISHES. 

VoU^aU'Ventj with IjruU (Alexis Soyer). These 
are generally used for the second course, and do not 
require to be so high as the others, especially as the 
fruit ought to be dressed in the form of a pjramid. If 
the puff-paste, of which they are to be formed, be cut 
about three quarters of an inch in thickness, it will be 
enough. When nearly baked, sift some powdered sugar 
over them, and put them back in the oven to glaze ; if 
not hot enough, use the salamander. Remove the 
interior, as for savoury Vols-au- Vent, taking care not to 
make a hole in the bottom or sides. Fill with any kind 
of fruit you like ; but never mix two kinds together, 
oxcept currant and raspberry. 

Sweet Vol-au'Vetity with Rhubarb (Idem). In the 
spring of the year, this makes a very inviting and 
wholesome dish, and its qualities purify the blood, which 
the winter's food has rendered gross. 

Cut about twelve sticks of rhubarb into lengths of 
one inch; put them in a stew-pan holding about two 
quarts ; put over them a quarter of a pound of sugar 
and a table-spoonful of water. Then set the stew-pan 
on a brisk fire, stirring well, to prevent browning and 
consequent loss of flavour. The rhubarb will take but a 
few minutes to do. When tender, put it in a basin to 
cool. A few minutes before serving, fill the Vol-au- 
Vent with it, and serve cold. 

Sweet Vol -au- Vent J wUh Green Gooseberries (Idem). 
A quart of green gooseberries, a quarter of a pound of 
powdered sugar, the juice of half a lemon, and a table- 
spoonful of water. Put on the fire, and move it about 



MADE DISHES. 335 

for ten minutes, or until tender, and forming a thick 
green marmalade. Put it in a basin till cold ; serve in 
a pyramid in the Vol-au-Vent A little thick syrup, if 
handy, improves the appearance. 

The same idea may be carried out with cherries 
(stoned and stewed), apples (quartered and stewed), and 
strawberries (sugared and uncooked). 

Chicken or Rabbit Curry. Cut up the chicken or 
rabbit, raw, into small joints, fit for serving with a 
spoon. Brown them in a frying-pan, with sliced onions 
and butter. When half cooked, put them in a stew-> 
pan, cover them with stock or good brown gravy, and 
let them simmer until tender. Sub smooth a dessert- 
spoonful of curry powder, a teaspoonful of flour, an 
ounce of butter, two table-spoonfuls of cream, and add 
it to the stew. Salt to your taste. Arrange ihe meat 
in the middle of your dish, and pour the gi'avy over it . 

You may make a curry of any thing , fish or flesh ; 
and the better the material employed, the better the 
curry. For instance, pheasant curry and lobster curry 
are excellent. Cold meat, or fish, for curry, need not 
be fried, but the onions must. 

Boiled rice is mostly served with curry. A common 
practice is to pile tlic rice round the dish, and put the 
curry in the middle. The correct way is to serve them 
on separate dishes. Each guest then takes what he 
chooses of each. 

Boiled Rice^ to be served with Curry. Wash the 
rice well in two difierent waters, and throw it into 
plenty of boiling water, with just a grain of salt in it. 



336 MADE DISHES. 

When nearly done (in twelve or fourteen minutes), 
drain off the water ; set it on the side of the stove, with 
the lid aslant, so as to allow the moisture to evaporate, 
shaking it up from time to time. The cooking of tlie 
rice will thus bo finished in its own vapour, and burn- 
ing (which would spoil both taste and colour) will be 
avoided. Bice for curries should not be in a mash, but 
have every grain dry and separate. 

Curried Plieasant or Partridges. Cut up the birds 
into exactly such joints as you would serve at table. 
Half fry them in butter to a nice brown, together with 
three or four sliced onions. 

Work a lump of butter with a table-spoonful of 
flour, and the same quantity of curry powder ; put it in 
your stew-pan with a pint of good stock, and stir well 
till all is smooth. 

Pare and core two or three apples ; chop them fine ; 
add to them an equal quantity of chopped heart of cab- 
bage, one pickled capsicum minced fine, the juice of a 
lemon, and a little salt Put these into your sauce, 
together with the fried game and a coffee-cupful of 
cream. Simmer till all is tender, with frequent stir- 
rings. When the meat is done, take it out with a 
spoon, and arrange it on your dish. Let the sauce boil 
up, to reduce it if necessary, and pour it boiling hot 
over tlie joints of game. 

Curries in general. Cut up into joints any fowl, 
rabbit, or game, you may want to curry ; meat or fish, 
into suitable pieces. 

Put four ounces of butter into a stew-pan ; when it 



KADE DISHES. 337 

is melted, put in the meat or fish, with a couple of sliced 
onions. Set your stew-pan over a brisk fire till they are 
nicely browned. Then stir in half a pint of broth, and 
let aU simmer for twenty minutes. 

Put into a basin one table-spoonfiil of curry powder, 
the same of flour, and a teaspoonful of salt Mix these 
smooth with a little cold water ; then put them into the 
stew-pan, and shake all well together, until your curry 
begins to boiL Take it off the fire, and let it simmer at 
the side for another twenty minutes longer. Then add 
the juice of half a lemon and a table-spoonful of melted 
butter. Give a final stir up, and serve hot, accompaniedy 
not surrounded, by boiled rice. 

In all curries, the quantity of curry powder used 
must depend, first, upon its age and strength; and, 
secondly, on the degree of spiciness desired. Many 
persons who are fond of curry find it disagree with them 
when made too hot In preparing these highly seasoned 
dishes, the cook should never forget that a curxy is one 
thing and a devil another. 

Mol^y a Mexican BagaCtt, Take half a turkey, and 
cut it in pieces of the same size as if for a curry ; put 
it in a stew-pan with just enough broth to stew it in, 
seasoning it with pepper and salt When tender, take 
it out and strain the gravy. 

Make a purle of three or four tomatoes (an equal 
quantity of bottled tomato sauce will serve the purpose), 
and mix with it a couple of pickled capsicums pounded 
in a mortar.

N.B. There are iioo ways of serving things (and 
almost any kind of meat may be so dressed) a la Jar- 
dmikre — a term which explains itself, as implying a 
liberal use of vegetables : First, the vegetables may be 
crushed and combined together into a pur^, as above ; 
or, secondly, they may be left whole^ after stewing with 
the meat, and neatly arranged around and about it, 
when the meat is served on the dish. This second mode 
is that usually employed with steaks and cutlets a la 
Jardiniirey and is preferred by many. The great variety 
of vegetables gives a tasteful appearance to dishes so 
dressed ; it has also the advantage of being less trouble- 
some (not requiring the vegetables to be mashed), and 
consequently more expeditious. Boots, such as carrots 
and turnips, may be cut into slices, slips, or ornamental 
shapes punched out with a stamp. Any vegetables which 
the season, or the Gardener's resources, can supply, may 
be used ; cnly^ those which would discolour the stew, or 
communicate to it a bitter flavour (as artichokes and 
Windsor beans), must be boiled separately, and added 
afterwards. Potatoes also are best co<^ed separately.

BEEF. 

The BailwajB are reducing every diing to the same 
level. Formerly, to eat first-rate beef, jon had to go to 
London, where it used to be far better than in its native 
place, in the immediate neighbourhood of the pastures 
where it was bfed and &ttened. Now, people complain, 
London beef is no longer what it was, beef being every 
where pretty much alike. 

The reason of this is, that beef is a meat which is 
improved by travelling, while alive. Like East-Lidia 
madeira, it is the better for the journey ; only, in the 
ease of the bullock, it must be performed on fi>ot. A 
moderate degree of fatigue, not amounting to exhaustion, 
causes the fat to incorporate more intimately with the 
lean, and the muscle itself to become more tender. Such 
meat acquired a softer, marrow-like consistency, and 
was doubtless more digestible than the robust, hard- 
fibred flesh which reaches Town, without the slightest 
exertion, by rail. Such is the fact, and it is no use to 
complain of it. It is one little item in the irresistible 
course of events, to which we must all of us submit. The 
cook must make up as well as she can for the ameli- 
orating effects which pedestrian travel once produced in 
oxen. 



9xsr, 341 

Beef is perliaps the most nutrltioas of butchers* meat^ 
mutton claiming equality with it in this respect ; but it 
certainly is not the most digestible, and must therefore 
be partaken of with considerable caution. None but 
persons in robust health, taking pleniy of air and exer- 
cise, may «a^t^' their appetite with beef, without risking 
unpleasant consequences. This, however, does not debar 
weak stomachs from tasting it in moderation, now and 
then, — ^not making it the staple of a meal, but diluting it, 
as it were, both with thorough cookery and lighter 
riands. It is often also the frequency with which some 
particular kinds of food are taken which causes them to 
disagree. People who can eat roast beef for dinner 
once a week with impunity, may have their digestive 
organs over-taxed by its being served to them three or 
four times — as is the case with families who roast lumps 
of beef big enough to carry ihem through the greater 
part of the week. They may eat pickle with it, cold, 
and spices with it, hashed ; there it is still — ^beef, beef, 
beef, in substance ; and all the more dangerous because 
good beef w very good. 

Many modes of poisoning (as those by emetics) are 
eifected by simply deranging the functions of the stomach. 
A continued course of indigestible meats is only another 
form of true slow poisoning. If you can digest beef 
easily, eat it freely; if you cannot — do as you please, 
and afterwards sing or sigh, ^^ Oh I the Roast Beef of 
Old England 1" 

Be^^ nevertheless, is a noble viand, of world-wide 
utility, as well as of heroic proportions. It is not the 



342 BEEF. 

Ox's fault, but our misfortune and loss, if the effects of 
our modern civilised life — from which not even Royal 
Beefeaters are exempt— often compel us to regard him with 
a cautious, even when with a covetous eye. The well- 
kept Sirloin, roasted to a turn (that is, rosy inside and 
full of gravy), accompanied by a stimulating sauce — 
horse-radish or anchovy — is the very dish to set, in 
winter time, before a numerous and hungry party. The 
• boiled Bound, salted and saltpetred to a day, is an ad- 
mirable and monumental joint, worthy to be sent to any 
International Exhibition or Exposition whatsoever, espe- 
cially if surrounded by bastions of vegetables — carrots, 
turnips, potatoes, and cabbages, disposed in pleasing 
alternation. 

Beef renders good service by its mere appendages. 
The tail makes a delicious stew or ragoiit; its palate 
affords an excellent and delicate side-dish ; the fillet, or 
•^ roll," of the loin, sliced artistically thin, laid a few 
minutes on the gridiron, and ser\'ed on a hot dish, with 
no other seasoning than a bit of fresh butter rolled in 
fine-chopped parsley, constitutes the wonder which the 
epicurean lights of other days called (afler its English 
inventors) a Beef*8 Teaky stating that it formed the 
principal dish at their dinners, and that it was worth 
braving the voyage across the Channel to taste it. And 
for Soup ? How, without Beef, should we manage for 
Soup ? 

lioast Beef. Begin by hanging it at a distance from 
the fire, bringing it nearer when about half or three- 
parts done. For the time of roasting, the general and 



BBEF. 343 

approximate rule is, a quarter of an hour for each pound 
of meat; but much will depend on the brightness and 
also the mass of the fire, the weather, and other circum- 
stances. Continual basting must be observed from the 
beginning to the end of the operation ; dredging with 
flour is a matter of choice. 

Sibs o/Beefxa9,y be bcmed (the butcher will mostly 
save the cook this trouble), rolled, tied round with a 
string, and so roasted in a solid lump ; which is conve- 
nient for carving, and also more presentable cold : but it 
is questionable whether boned joints of meat are quite so 
juicj and succulent as those in which the bones are 
allowed to remain. In the former case, however, the 
bones render service by helping to make stock-broth. 

Tlie Loin may be disposed of in various ways, or 
roasted whole, in its natural state. The Fillet, taken 
out, makes the tenderest of all beef-steaks ; marinaded, 
^and then either roasted or saut&l, it affords a delicious 
little dish — ^the very thing for a very small party or a con- 
valescent's dinner. With the Fillet removed, the upper 
part of the loin may be either boned, rolled, and roasted, 
like the ribs, or stewed whole, with the bones left in it, 
with carrots, turnips, onions, and a variety of other 
vegetables, a la JardinUrey and seasoned widi whole 
•doves and peppercorns. Any other joint of beef, Shiny 
Rumpy &C., is stewed in the same way, the only difference 
being a question of time, as the sinewy parts take con- 
siderably longer than those which consist merely of 
muscular flesh. Stewed Beef affords the convenience of 
being just as good warmed up again next day, which 



3^ BEST. 

also affords ihe opportimitj of completely removing the 
grease from the gravy. On the first day of serving, for 
those who object to too much fat or richness in Ihe 
gravy y when the beef is done, pnt it in the middle of its 
dish (made quite hot) ; arrange the vegetables aromid 
it ; and then, into the gravy remaining in ihe stew-pan, 
gradually stir a dessert-spoonful or so of flour, adding a 
good table-spoonful of mushroom ketchup, and half a 
wine-glass of red wine. Let it boil; pass it through a 
cullender, if at all knotty ; and pour over the stewed 
beef and vegetables. 

N.B. A metal or earthenware cullender or strainer is 
preferable to a tammy or sieve for all these purposes. 
Cullenders and strainers are made pierced with holes 
of all sizes up to the extreme of fineness. Metal and 
earthenware are easily cleaned and kept clean ; it is the 
kitchen-maid's fault if the flavour or smell of the things 
they have strained adheres to them afterwards : whereas 
horse-hair and linen sieves are more difficult to cleanse, 
are apt to get mouldy if neglected for a day or two, and 
are even affected by moisture in the air when the weather 
is unusually moist or changeable. 

Boiled Beefy Salted. All meat takes salt &ster in 
warm weather than in cold. Tastes vaiy as to the degree 
of saltness desirable in meats, but moderately salted meat 
is both more nutritious and more digestible than that 
which is very salt When meat has to be preserved 
for long periods, or dried or smoked, of course the 
salting must be carried to a degree ^sufficient to effect its 
preservation. 



For private families, beef will be quite enough salted 
in from four days to a week. First rub it with pounded 
sallpetre, to give the scarlet tinge to the inside. Too 
much must not be used, for fear of turning the meat 
hard : half an ounce will do for a joint of from seven to 
eight pounds. Then lay the beef in jour salting-pan, 
and cover it completely with common salt well heaped 
over it. Turn the meat every day, and ladle it with the 
brine which forms in the dish. Beef so salted is more 
delicate than when plunged into a ready-made brine; 
which, however, has its advantages when several pieces 
are salted at once, as well as in hot weather, when flies 
are troublesome. The addition of sugar for salting beef 
is a matter of taste ; it is usually reserved for meat 
intended to be dried, htmg, or smoked. Miss Acton 
very correctly observes : " Saltpetre hardens and renders 
the meat indigestible ; sugar, on the contrary, mellows 
and improves it much.'' The one flatters the eye ; the 
other suits the stomach. 

To Pickle Beefm Brine. To three gallons of spring 
water add six pounds of common salt, two pounds of bay- 
salt, two pounds of common loaf-sugar, and two ounces 
of saltpetre. Boil these over a gentle fii*e, take ofi^ the 
soum as it rises, and let it stand till quite cold before you 
put your beef in. The beef should be previously rubbed 
with salt, and allowed to drain for a day or two, in order 
to draw the blood out of it, before putting it into the 
pickle. 

Hunter'* 8 Beef. For a large round of beef, of from 
thirty to forty potmds, take a quarter of a pound of 



d46 BEEF. 

ground allspice, a litde bruised maoe, a quarter of a 
pound of saltpetre, and two pounds of common salt. 
Mix these ingredients together, and with them rub the 
beef well twice a daj for ten days. Then get three 
poundfl of good beef-dripping, and lay it over the round 
of beef, covering the whole with a thick paste made of 
flour and water. Then put it into a very slow oven to 
bake for seven or eight hours. It must not be cut up 
until cold. By leaving the crust of paste sticking round 
it, it will keep good for two or three months if carefully 
protected from flies and damp. 

Beefmsiy be salted in a hurry in twenty-four hours, 
or in a night and morning, thus : 

Take a large shallow dish ; fill it with water, and lay 
over it three or four cross sticks. On these place your 
piece of beef, whose upper and under surfaces should be 
fiat On the beef pile as much salt as it will carry. The 
vapour from the water, caught by the salt, will form a 
•concentrated brine, which, trickling down, will rapidly 
penetrate the meat K during the time allowed you can 
turn the meat, applying the salt to the other side also, it 
will still further hasten the process. 

Salt Beef must be set on with the water cold, if it is 
wished to be tender and to swell in the boiling. Fresh- 
salted beef may be rinsed, or only wiped ; long-salted 
beef requires steeping in fresh water for a time varying 
with its condition. Sailors' salt beef is sometimes un* 
salted by steeping in tlie sea, showing how completely it 
must have been saturated by the pickle. 

Carrots, turnips, and parsnips may be boiled together 



BEEF. 347 

-wiih the beef (patting them in when the water boils) ; 
French cooks would allow cabbages also to join company 
with the above. The vegetables can either garnish the 
beef on its dish, or be served separately (chopped or 
mashed) m vegetable-dishes, or both. 

Beef must be very slightly salted indeed to make the 
boilings desirable to use for soup. They are usually em«- 
ployed for pease soup ; but it is sometimes an economy 
of the pocket at the expense of the stomach. 

Rolled Beef. Take a slice of lean beef weighing a 
pound, and a similar slice of leg of veal. These slices 
should be cut cusross the fibre of the muscle, and be about 
half an inch in thickness. 

Then take half a pound of fresh sausage-meat, as 
much grated bread-crumbs as will fill an egg-sheU, 
soaked in milk ; mix these thoroughly together with a 
beat-up egg. 

Sprinkle both the slices of meat with pepper and 
«alt, and spread over them equally the sausage-meat, &c. 
Then roll up first the beef, beginning at one end, exactly 
as you would a roly-poly pudding ; then roll the slice of 
veal and its stuffing over the roUed-up beef. Tie all 
together tightly with string. The beef is put inaidey 
because it may be eaten more underdone than veal. 

Put the rolled meat into a stew-pan with a lump of 
butter ; when it is nicely browned outside, moisten with 
stock enough to cook it in. Let it stew for an hour and 
a half or an hour and three quarters, turning it from 
time to time. 

When done, place the rolled meat in its dish. 



348 BEEF. 

Thicken the sauce with arrowroot, adding lemon-juioe, 
mushrooms, and chopped parsley. Boil up, and pour it 
over the meat. 

JBouUli — BaUed Beefy Unsalted (French), from which 
the day's soup has been made, is served immediately 
after the soup, accompanied by the vegetables which 
have flavoured it, and is eaten with mustard and pickled 
gherkins. The Ancien Rigime treated this dish with so 
much respect, that etiquette prohibited your asking for 
du houilli; the rule was, to request a piece of Beef, du 
hoeuf. 

English palates despise this insipid, unsalted beef, 
boiled almost to shreds. They reject it as good for no- 
thing, innutritious. In fact, not a little soup-meat in 
England is thrown out-of-doors, or given to the dogs. 
Poor people would be affronted by its being offered to 
them as a gift. They are wrong ; for boiled meat, even 
when over-done, still contains many alimentary elements. 
Seme of its gelatine and fat and gravy certainly have 
been abstracted ; but by no means all. And such meat 
has the great advantage of being light and digestible. It 
is clean gone and forgotten, perhaps for hours, when the 
same quantity of underdone roast meat would still weigh 
heavily on the labouring stomach. The results are a 
matter of calculation. Suppose that boiled meat — French 
Bouilliy for instance — contains only half tlie nutriment of 
roast meat; and that our digestive apparatus, the stomach, 
is able to assimilate, with ease, a certain quantity of 
boiled, in the same time that it would reduce, with dif- 
ficulty, half that quantity of roast, meat, it is clear that 



349 

the amount of nutriment extracted would be the same, 
with less &tigue to the organ in the case of boiled meat. 
Now, if it be imprudent to over-task any of our organs^ 
it is certainly imprudent to over-work the stomach. 

By serving botli boiled and roast at a meal, the 
former serves as light filling-up stuff, as wadding, as 
package (in itself no worthless material), to prevent the 
vessel's taking in too heavy a ballast of roast Why, 
the Doctor himself, though blessed with a model stomach, 
cannot commit the imprudence of dining heartily — ^as he 
always dines — off roast beef and potatoes only, followed 
by a bit of cheese, without feeling a heaviness, a tendency 
to indigestion, which he is tempted to throw off by the 
second imprudence of taking an extra glass of wine* 
Boiled meats, therefore— even for the healthy, and still 
more for the sedentary and the convalescent — are anala- 
gous in their effects to bread ; they fill without repletion, 
and satisfy without fatigue. Bread itself does the same. 

" Why do you eat such a quantity of bread ?" the 
Doctor once inquired of a French out-door labourer. 

^^ The reason is plain," he answered, with a laugh, 
'^ if Monsieur will only reflect a moment. Monsieur's 
horse is very fond of oats ; but Monsieur does not feed 
him entirely on oats. When he has had enough of that, 
he is obliged to content himself, for the rest of the day, 
with straw. Monsieur will understand that meat is my 
oats. I can't afford to live on meat alone ; and it might 
not be good for me if I could. So I make up the rest 
with bread : bread is my straw." 

Beef h la Mode (French). Take any fleshy piece of 



350 BEEF. 

beef; remove the bone; lard (prick) it all over with 
tmsmoked bacon, and dost it with finely minced parsley 
and chives, salt, ground pepper, and other spices. Take 
a saucepan, into which put a small quantity of ordinaiy 
white wine (good cider does well as a substitute), bacon cut 
small into dice, shallots minced fine, small onions whole, 
slices of carrot, peppercorns, and a little salt. Lay your 
beef upon these ingredients : cover the stew-pan close, 
and put it over a slow fire. Make it simmer gently for 
five or six hours, and then serve your beef with all its 
accompaniments and seasonings. 

Beef-steaksj French — Bifteksj as they call them. 
For this purpose, French butchers (in the capital and 
the larger cities) cut out the whole of the fillet or " roll" 
of the sirloin, and sell it to restaurants and hotel-keepers 
at a very high price. 

Cut your steak across the fillet, somewhat more than 
an iiich thick. It will be nearly circular in form. 
Make it as much so as you can, by paring ofi^ the fibres 
and loose pieces, leaving as much fat as possible. Flatten 
it on a block by a blow or two of the flat side of your 
meat-chopper, or a wooden beater kept for the purpose, 
till it is reduced to at least half its original thickness. 
Dip it in tepid butter; dust it over with pepper and 
salt ; and grill it on a gridiron over a brisk charcoal fire, 
turning it continually. Serve it rather underdone, and 
full of gravy, on a hot dish, in the middle of which 
you have laid a piece of butter sprinkled with chopped 
parsley. 

Beef-steaks dressed in the foregoing way are also 



BEEF. 351 

served garnished with fried potatoes; or with water- 
oresses, seasoned with pepper, salt, and vinegar ; or with 
brown mushroom sauce. 

This French Bifieky which is really both delicious- 
and digestible, is not frequently served in England; 
because our butchers cannot be expected to make their 
sirloins unsaleable by robbing them of the fillet We 
give the receipt, mainly because it is an excellent restor- 
ative for convalescents; and few families will mind 
sacrificing the appearance of a joint for once, or even 
i^r twice, when the health of one of their members 
requires it, — especially as we have indicated ways of 
utilising the rest of the sirloin. 

Dr. MarigoWa Beef^ateak Pudding for One. Quantity

JRump^eteaky Broiled or Fried. No one who has tasted 
a tender Bump-steak, grilled over a charcoal fire, will 
ever eat a fried one if he can help it ; but, in a land of 
coal, there is often no choice in the matter. 

The meat for this should hang (in the joint) as long 
as possible ; never less than a week, weather permitting. 
In summer, it must be made tender by beating. Cut it 
not more than three-quarters of an inch thick. It is a 
matter of taste and convenience whether to cook it entire 
in its length, or to divide it into several shorter pieces. 
For two or three persons, quite a small quantity suffices;. 



352 BBEFi 

and it is better to make several cookings than to have 
steak left cold. 

Rump-steak, whether fried or broiled, should be done 
quicJdy over a brisk fire. Broiled steak will require no 
sauce except a slight sprinkling of chopped parslej, a 
bit of butter in the dish, and perhaps a dessert-spoonM 
of mushroom ketchup poured over it at serving. Fried 
steak may be accompanied by brown mushroom sauce, 
or by oyster sauce, heightened by a teaspoonful of essence 
of anchovy and a shred of horse-radish. 

Stewed Rump-steak. At the bottom of a stew-pan 
put a layer of sliced carrots, onions, and any other 
vegetables to taste, together with a bouquet complete. 
Moisten with just enough stock to keep them from burn- 
ing. On these lay your steaks ; cover close with the lid, 
and let them stew very slowly for several hours, until 
quite tender; stirring occasionally, to make sure that 
nothing sticks to the bottom. You may serve the gravy 
with it, either just as it comes from the stew-pan, or 
you may treat it as directed for stewing the loin. 

Beef-steak Pie. Invert a cupful of highly seasoned 
stock in the middle of your pie-dish. Cut the steaks 
into pieces of convenient size for serving to each person, 
or less than that rather than larger. Dust them on each 
side with flour, pepper, and salt Arrange them in the 
dish, intermingling with them a small proportion of fat. 
A few pieces of veal, with two or three hard-boiled eggs 
in quarters, make an agreeable variety in the contents of 
the pie. Pour over these a little well-seasoned stock, 
cover with a good stout crust, and bake thoroughly. 



BEEF. 353 

Beef-steak pie is best hot ; but is often oonvenient cold 
for travelling and excursions. 

A pie composed of beef-steak only is almost too 
solid a dish for ordinary appetites ; but any pie composed 
of meat, fowl, or game, is the better for having a layer of 
beaf-steak at the bottom, on which the other ingredients 
are afterwards placed* The bottom of the pie-dish being 
in contact with the floor of the oven, the steak acts as 
a non-conductor, and intercepts the heat which might 
otherwise over-cook the tenderer meats; it likewise 
enriches the gravy. 

Stewed Ox^cheeL An economical and wholesome 
winter dish, and a great favourite with many persons. 

The fresher your ox-cheek is, the better. Qtei the 
butcher to remove the eye, the bones of the jaws, and as 
much of the internal cartilage of the nostrils as possible. 
Wash it well ; let it steep all night in salt-and-wator, to 
draw away the blood, &c ; wash it again next morning, 
and let it drain an hour or two, either hung up or on a 
dish. 

Ox-cheek takes a deal of cooking ; you may, there- 
fore, without the slightest sacrifice of nutriment, treat it 
as directed in the boiling of a Calf s Head for Mock- 
Turtle Soup (p. 147), t. e. dumge the water soon after it 
has boiled up and been well skimmed. The ox-cheek 
soup will thus be kept pure, dean, and perfectly free 
from any objectionable matters. 

When the cheek has boiled in the soup-kettle for three 
hours, or a little longer, take it up ; remove the bones 
(which may have been previously cracked to assist in the 

A A 



354 BXBF* 

operation) and the white warty skin of the palate. Trim 
off the rough outside edges, so as to make it a handsome 
oval-shaped lamp of meat. Pat it in a deep steuhpariy 
and cover it completely with its own liquor, seasoning 
with salt, cloves, peppercorns, and a bouquet complete* 
After it has stewed an hour or so, add six or eight 
middle-sized onions whole, two sticks of celery, three or 
four turnips cut in halves, and the same of carrots in 
short lengths. Continue to stew till the cheek is quite 
tender. It will take from five to six hours in all, and 
may, therefore, be cooked in two doings, which is often 
a convenience. Serve the vegetables round the meat, 
and pour the hot gravy over it 

The trimmings, and what is lefl of the boilings, make 
excellent soup, with the addition of vegetables. 

Bullock*8 Heart. Wash the heart well inside and 
out, rub it with salt idemy and let it hang as long as. 
the weather will allow. 

Stuff it with veal stuffing, and roast or bake, not too 
quickly, but thoroughly, basting assiduously as often aa 
you can. Any roast-beef or veal gravy you may have 
lefl is best for the purpose. Serve accompanied by rich, 
gravy (like that coming from the stewed ox-cheek), well 
seasoned, with a dessert-spoonful of mushroom ketchup 
and half a glass of red wine in it. 

The flavour of roast or baked Beef-Heart has a slight 
resemblance to that of hare, which may be increased by 
marinading it in an infusion of aromatic herbs in wine- 
and vinegar. In this case, roast it stuffed as before, and 
"wnd up currant jelly with it

Tripe. The qnaliiy of this depends on the tripe-shop 
from which it is procured ; when neatly prepared^ it is 
very nice and delicate ; but if the operation has been 
negligently and slovenly performed, it is offensive and 
uneatable ; and it is hardly a cook's place to clean and 
prepare raw tripe as it is taken from the animal. The 
first step in dressing it is to boil it (for which some use 
milk-and-water) until quite tender. It is then allowed 
to cool, and is finished off and served in various ways : 
one of the nicest being to cut it into squares, dip it 
into batter and bread-crumbs, and fry to a light 
brown. 

Tripe Curry. Brown sliced onions, with butter, in a 
stew-pan ; put in your tripe cut into squares ; moisten 
with a few spoonfuls of broth. 

Mix in a basin a teaspoonfiil of flour, a table-spoonful 
of cnny powder, half a teacupful of cream, and a tea- 
cupful of stock. When worked quite smooth, add it to 
the rest, and stew till all is tender, stirring or shaking 
from time to time.

Neat's Foot may be plain-boiled, and served with 
the sance recommended for Salmon and Mackarel, ie. 
melted butter heightened with mustard and vinegar, and 
perhaps horse-radish. So tasteless a substance maj be 
sauced indifferently as either fish, fiesh, or fowl. Or, it 
may be stewed in brown gravy, with fried onions, mixed 
vegetables, and aromatic herbs; or, it may be halved, 
dipped in batter, sprinkled with biscuit-raspings, and 
broiled. The neatest and most pleasing way of present- 
ing it, is to cut it into smallish pieces, removing all the 
bones ; then to dip these first in beaten egg, and then in 
bread-crumbs, and grill them till they are of a nice light 
brown all over. They may, thus, either be served as a 
side-dish, or wiU make an elegant addition to any other 
stewed or hashed preparation of bee£ The truth is, 
that Neat's Foot consists too entirely of gelatine and 
tendon to constitute a dish by itself. Gelatinous sub- 
stance — ^as La Fontaine remarked of virtue— is neccssaiy ; 
but not too much of it Excess in any thing is faulty. 
A Neat's Foot, however, boiled down to jelly, is both 
useful and economical to give richness and consistency 
to soups, stews, and gravies, of whatever kind.

cloves, thyme, bay-leaf, and other aromatic herbs. 
Over these pile plenty of salt ; rub it well, and turn it 
in this pickle, every day for a fortnight. It may then 
be either boiled, or hung up to dry. 

To cook it, put it in a soup-kettle full of cold water, 
with a few onions, two or three cloves, and a small 
bouquet of thyme and bay-leaves. Let it simmer very 
gently for four or five hours. Let it cool in its liquor, 
and then take it out to drain and be garnished on its 
dish. 

Beef'Tongue au Gratin* Baked. Peel the tongue 
as directed in the preceding receipt Chop together 
parsley, chives, tarragon, a few capers or gherkins,, and 
three shallots. Take as much grated crumb of bread as 
will fill an egg-shell, and a piece of butter of half that 
size, and mix well with the chopped herbs. Spread 
this over the bottom of a dish which will stand the fire. 
Cut the tongue into thick slices ; arrange half of them 
on the layer of herbs ; season with salt, peppercorns, 
and the rest of your mincings. Put a second layer of 
crumbs, and season in the same way. Cover the whole 
with bread-crumbs; moisten with a few spoonfuls of 
broth, and half a glass of wine. Let it bake in a slow 
oven until done, taking care to add more broth from 
time to time if it gets too dry. N.B. This dish suc- 
ceeds with greater certainty when a ready-cooked tongue 
is used.

quantity of sliced onions. When they are nicely 
browned, add a dust of flour, some mushrooms, a litde 
stock, and a wineglass of red wine. Let these simmer 
over a gentle fire until the onions are cooked to a pulp. 
Set it on the side of your stove ; put in your slices of 
beef (nicely trimmed and cut very thin) to warm up 
and absorb the sauce. They must not boil. When it is 
time to serve, arrange the slices of beef with a spoon 
and fork all round the dish, and pour the sauce in the 
middle. Some cooks heighten the seasoning of this 
with a dash of mustard; but it is apt to disagree 
with weak stomachs. 

Beef'Kidneyy SautM in Wine. Cut up the kidney into 
^sery thin slices. Qive them a toss or two in butter in a 
stew-pan over a brisk fire. As soon as they begin to 
cook, dredge in a little flour, chopped sweet herbs, 
sliced mushrooms (if you can get them) ; moisten with 
a small quantity of half good broth and half red wine ; 
reason with lemon-juice, pepper, salt, and a dust of 
grated nutmeg. Let it simmer gently three or four 
minutes, and serve. Tou may garnish it round with 
toast 

Few dishes are more easily spoiled and rendered 
indigestible than this excellent preparation. Too long

XII. 

MUTTON AND LAMB. 

"Hkavbn," said the Welsh preacher, searching hard 
for a comparison, — " Heaven is like — is like — is like — 
Heaven is like — Boiled Mutton and Turnips." But the 
Cambrian Heaven is still incomplete, if caper sauce be 
lacking to it. 

J£ Railways have done injury to London beef, they 
have enriched London's supply of Mutton. We can 
now enjoy Welsh heavenly mutton, without going to 
Wales to eat it. 

Boast Leg of Mutton may be a vulgar dish ; neverthe- 
1<96S, it is both succulent and nutritive, especially if it 
has made people wait for it, like other self-important 
personages, and if it also presents an internal aspect as 
sanguinary at heart as a New-Zealand cannibal. Li 
this case, it retains both its tenderness and its gravy ; in 
other words, to eat it in all its gloiy, it must not be 
over-done. At the first cut of the carving-knife, brook- 
lets of juice ought to issue firom its streaming sides. Its 
slices, thin and of a rosy red, will favourably impress 
the delighted palate, previous to supplying the most 
weary stomach with an aliment as salutary as it is sub- 
stantial. If the Leg be not quite cooked enough, it is 
easy to apply a remedy, in the dining-room itself, by 



362 MUTTON AlID LAMB. 

giving a few slices a toss or two in a sauoepan, in a litde 
of their own gravy, over a clear fire. If it be avernianey 
the case is past hope, the misfortune irreparable. 

Doubtless, the exact point is diflScult to hit ; a torn 
or two more will involve the disgrace or the glory of 
the most aristocratic of Legs of Mutton. But these 
niceties are not to be learned from Cook-Books merely ; 
practice and experience alone can teach them. The rule, 
as with beef, of a quarter of an hour for every pound of 
mutton to be roasted, is only approximative — a near 
approach to the exact time required. The art of roasting 
meat to perfection is one of the most difficult existing. 
For twenty good cooks (of other things), you will not 
find more than one or two good Roasters. 

On the Continent, a clove of garlic is often introduced 
into the flesh of a Leg of Mutton to be roasted, near the 
knuckle. It is a question of taste. The Doctor does 
not like it, holding that garlic is incompatible with the 
flavour oi roast mutton (although it is admissible into 
hashes and stews composed of that meat) ; and that it is 
<iuite incongruous with currant jelly as an accompani- 
ment. 

Roa^t Shoulder of Mutton is often tenderer than the 
Leg, and it has a peculiar flavour of its own which finds 
its admirers. Who does not remember with unction the 
satisfaction to be derived from Shoulder of Mutton and 
Kidney Beans? The Shoulder may be roasted, boned 
and rolled — a convenience, but hardly an improvement 

All Roast Mutton should be served with et>ery thing 
hot — ^hot dishes, hot plates, hot gravy, hot spoons to 



HUTTON ASD LAMB* 363 

serve it with, hot vegetables, and (as a novelfy) hot 
knives and forks. 

When a leg of mutton is hardly tender enough to 
bear the honours of the jack, it makes an admirable 
Brats€j under the name of a Seven-Houni* Leg ; served 
reposing on a bed of vegetables, varying according to 
ihe season. It is far too good to be omitted here. 

Gigot au JuSy or a la RoyaU — Leg of Mutton in 
iSravyy a dish for a Queetu 

Put a nice leg of mutton into your stew-pan, with 
eight large carrots cut in slices, twelve onions, a calf's 
foot, or a pound of knuckle of veal, and a little salt 
Cover all with water, and let it simmer over a gentle 
fire. 

When the mutton begins to shrink from the bone, 
and is about half done, take it out of the stew-pan. Let 
the rest boil, until it is reduced to about three pints ; 
then strain it through a napkin or a sieve, pressing the 
vegetables and veal a little hard. Let it cool to a jelly, 
and take off the fai It is better to prepare the dish thus 
far the day before it is wanted. 

Replace the leg of mutton in the stew-pan with the 
gravy-jelly. Let it boil, close covered, not too fast, a 
couple of hours, taking care to prevent its burning or 
stacking to the bottom of the pan. Serve in a deep dish 
with the gravy, which will be concentrated and highly 
flavoured, garnishing the edge with slices of lemon. 

In the north of England, hot mutton (roast especially) 
is often accompanied by cold Ham ; and the association 
is far from disagreeable. 



364 MUTTON AND LAMB. 

Boiled Leg of Mutton is one of the simplest and 
most delicate of meats, yielding only to its offspring. 
Boiled Leg of Lamb. Keep it awhile, but not too long ; 
hot water must replace the effects of time. Put it on 
the fire, well covered, in cold water, with a dessert- 
spoonful of salt. Take off all scum as fast as it rises. 
When it boils, draw it aside, allowing it only to simmer 
gently from three to four hours. 

An hour before you judge it will be enough, throw 
in turnips peeled and halved, carrots idem^ a few whole 
onions, and a couple of sticks of celery. If these chill 
the water too much, the pot can be set on the fire again, 
to be withdrawn as soon as it boils up afresh. 

On serving, garnish your leg of mutton with a circle 
of the vegetables (whole) on the dish, taking care to 
reserve turnips enough to mash with cream, pepper, and 
salt, to be sent up in a separate dish. 

Accompany Boiled Leg of Mutton or Lamb with 
caper sauce, or, in default of capers, with pickled nas- 
turtium seeds and flower-buds, or chopped gherkins, 
thrown into white sauce. 

Boiled Shoulder of Mutton is served as above ; only, 
instead of being accompanied by mashed turnips, it 
rather calls for onion sauce, t. e. onions boiled very soft 
(together with the mutton), and then either merely 
mashed with pepper, salt, and cream, or squeezed through 
a cullender, so as to make a pur£e ; the choice being left 
to the cook*s convenience. 

Boiled Neck of Mutton competes with the above in 
popularity. Being smaller, it is convenient for small 



MUTTON AKD LAMB, 365 

families, and maybe further diminished by having a few 
chops taken from its best end. It takes less time to 
cook — another convenience. 

The Boilings of every joint of Mutton whatsoever 
will be carefully utilised by the cook. 

The Neck may be also roasted and stewed, as well 
as boiled ; the Shoulder lends itself to the same diversity 
of treatment, enabling the accomplished cook to show 
that her intellect is an inexhaustible storehouse of learned 
receipts. 

The Zom and the Saddle (or double loin) are almost 
always Boasted; although the former is occasionally 
Stewed. The Loin, too, is often cut up into chops or 
cutlets ; the various ways of dressing which alone would 
fill a bulky and elaborate volume. Soyer even invented 
the plan of cutting up the Saddle into cutlets — a heresy 
and a profanation, many would say, wei-e not utility and 
convenience paramount in all tilings culinary — perform- 
ing the operation thus : 

Sot/ePs new Mutton- Chop. Trim a middling-sized 
saddle of mutton, which cut into chops half an inch in 
thickness, with a saw, without at all making use of a 
knife (the sawing them off jagging the meat and causing 
ihem to eat more tender) ; then trim them into shape, 
season well with salt and pepper, place them upon a 
gridiron over a sharp fire, turning them three or four 
times. They would require ten minutes' cooking. When 
done, dress them upon a hot dish, spread a small piece 
of butter over each (if approved of), and serve. By add- 
ing half a table-spoonful of Soyer's Gentlemen's or 



366 s KUTTOK Amy laub. 

Ladies' Sauce to each cliop when serving, and toming- 
it over two or three times, you produce an excellent 
entrde. The bone keeping the gravy in whilst cooking, 
it is a great advantage to have chops cut after the above 
method. At home, when I (Alexis Soyer) have a saddle- 
of mutton, I usually cut two or three such chops, which 
I broil, rub Maitre d'Hdtel butter over, and serve with 
fried potatoes round ; using the remainder of the saddle 
the next day for a joint The above are also very excel- 
lent, well seasoned and dipped into egg and bread-crumbs 
previous to broiling. 

Lamb' Chops may be cut precisely the same, but 
require broiling a few minutes less. 

By this plan, the fat and lean are better divided, 
and you can enjoy both. Whilst the old way of cutting 
Mutton-Chops produces a lump of meat near the bone,, 
and fat at the other end, which partly melts in cooking,, 
and is often burnt by the flame it makes ; the new way,, 
not dividing the bone, keeps the gravy in admirably.. 
If well sawed, it should not weigh more than an ordinary 
chop, being about half the thickness. 

The Doctor* 8 Mutton^Steah Choose, by preference,, 
a small or middle-sized Leg of Mutton ; Welsh or South- 
down is the best. Cut it in halves, right across the 
internal kernel of fat reverently spoken of as " the Pope's- 
Eye." Saw the bone neatly through. From the inner 
side of each of these halves take one or more slices of 
mutton, not more than three-quarters and not less than 
half an inch thick, performing the operation with a very 
sharp knife, and sawing the bone skilfully through^ 



HUTTON AND LAMB. 367 

Tour bntcher, perhaps, will exeonte it for you more- 
neatijy and widi less hacking, than jour oook can da 
You will thus have two or more handsome oval-shaped 
steaks of matton-flesh. 

Slightly peppar and salt your steaks on both sides ; 
grill them over a eharooal fire, turning them several 
times with your steak-tongs. Serve on a dish so hot 
that yon cannot take hold of it without a napkin, and 
pour over each steak a dessert-spoonful of first-rate 
mushroom ketchup, for which Harvey's or Worcester- 
shire Sauce may be substituted. 

The Doctor^ 8 Mutton^Steak^ Fried, is good, but far 
inferior to BroUed, It is also excellent thus : 

Stewed. Just brown yom: steaks on each side in the 
firying-pah, or in the large, shallow stew-pan in whidi 
they are to be finished off. Then cover the steaks with 
a variety of any good vegetables that are in season; 
green pease, young carrots, small turnips sliced, celery 
cut into small pieces, a few leaves of sorrel and parsley,, 
haricots, &o. &c Moisten with a teaoupfiil of mutton 
broth, and half a glass of wine (white or red). Let the 
cover of the stew-pan fit down as close as possible. 
Simmer very gently over a slow fire, giving a shake 
from time to time, to make sure that nothing sticks 
to the bottom. It takes a considerable time to do 
thoroughly, but has the advantage of being able to be 
kept hot, and always remaining in readiness. 

The Doctor's Steaks help small families or new- 
married couples to an agreeable way of disposing of that 
somewhat heavy joint, a Leg of Mutton. Thus, they 



368 MUTTON AND LAJCB. 

can have: First Day, Mutton-Steaks; Second Day, 
something else; Third Day, Thick End, Boasted; 
Fourth Day, something else ; Fifth Day, Knuckle Boiled 
or Stewed ; Sixth Day, what they please. 

Lamb-ChopSj with Cucumber Satusej or vnih Purde of 
Cvcamber. For the Cucumber Sauce, peel, slice, pepper 
and salt, one or more cucumbers, exactly as if for eating 
uncooked. At the bottom of a stew-pan put in a little 
bit of butter ; when it is melted, stir in a dust of flour. 
On this place your sliced cucumber; add just enough 
stock or mutton broth to cover it, and boil till the 
slices are quite tender, without, however, falling to 
pieces. 

If you have the means, hroSL the Lamb-Chops, egged 
and bread-crumbed ; if you have not, you have no choice 
but to fry them. 

When done, arrange them regularly round your 
(very hot) dish. Add a table-spoonful of vinegar to 
your Cucumber Sauce^ give it another boil up, and 
serve it in the centre of the Chops, so that each person, 
in helping himself to a chop, can also take a portion of 
the cucumber. 

Supposing that you have/rt^ your chops, English 
fashion, in the least possible quantity of butter sufficient 
to keep them from burning, you may turn to good 
account the small remnant of gravy left in the pan, 
thus : When the chops are laid round their dish, and the 
vinegar added to the Cucumber Sauce, after boiling up^ 
take out the cucumber with a spoon, and lay it in the 
middle of the chops. Pour the liquid sauce that is left 



KUTTON AKD LAMB. 369 

in the stew-pan to the gravy in your fiying-pan. Set 
it on the fire, and stir with a fork. When the two are 
well incorporated, pour the combined sauees boiling hot 
over the Chops and ilie Cucnmber. 

For the Purie of Cucumbersj peel several cucumberS| 
not too far advanced. Boil the peelings in water or 
mutton broth, until it has acquired their flavour. Taste 
that it is not too bitter, in which case it must be diluted, 
or rejected. When this liquor is to your taste, boil in 
it your cucumbers, cut into pieces, until they becomor 
a pulp which you can squeeze through your cullender. 
After squeezing, return them to the saucepan, and season 
with butter, pepper, salt, and vinegar. Give another 
boil up, taking care not to bum, and pour the pur^ in 
the middle of the chops. 

Muttan^Kidneysj SautM vntli Wine. The same pro- 
ceeding as with beef-kidney, and the same precautions 
not to overdo them. 

Muttou'Eidneysj Broiled. Peel off the thin outer 
skin of the kidneys ; split them down the middle on the 
hollow side, without entirely separating them ; sprinkle 
their inner surfaces with pepper and salt. The kidneys 
should only be turned once on the gridiron ; therefore, 
to keep the gravy in, expose the cut side jflrst to the 
action of the fire, afterwards the outer side. If taken off 
the gridiron at exactly the right moment, they will be 
tender and full of gravy ; if allowed to remain too long, 
they will be dry, leathery, and slwivelled up. As soon 
as the kidneys are dished, put in the middle of each a 
piece of sweet butter as big as a hazel-nut, and a good 

B B 



370 KUTTOK AND UUIB. 

pinch of finely chopped parsley and chervil^ to which 
some cooks add spring onions or chives. 

MtUUm-Kidnei/s may be Fried j but they require even 
more cautions treatment than in broiling. In the &t 
and gravy left in the pan, a few fresh eggs may be 
briskly fried, and served in the same dish with the 

MuUon-Kidneys^ Roasted or Toaatedy in a Dutch or 
American oven. After peeling off the thin skin and 
opening them, these are spitted on thin iron spits, and 
so suspended in the oven before the fire. A consider- 
able quantity of gravy will sometimes drop from them, 
which may be received on a toast at the bottom of 
the oven. On this toast serve the kidneys, garnish- 
ing each one with butter and minced sweet herbs, as 
before. 

A few roasted sausages make a very nice accompani- 
ment to Mutton-Kidneys. 

MuUan-Kidnet/Sy in Champagne Wine. Peel the 
kidneys, slice them thin, and put them into a stew-pan, 
with half an eggshellful of minced beef-^et for every 
half-dozen kidneys. Season with pepper, salt, grated 
nutmeg, chopped parsley, and mushrooms. Toss them 
over a brisk fire. As soon as they begin to cook, dredge 
in a teaspooniul of flour, and add a wine-glassful or 
more of Champagne [or any other good light, sweet, 
white wine ; for, between us, and quite in confidence, it 
comes to the same ; even first-rate cider will pass without 
cavil]. Stir them all the while they are on the fire, on 
which they must not remain more than four or five 



MUTTOK AJSID LAMB. 371 

minutes. Just before serving, put in a piece of butter 
as big as a walnut, and the juice of half a lemon. 

Mutton- Cutlets a la Jardiniire. Boil in stock or 
good mutton broth some fresh haricots, green peas, 
sprigs of cauliflower, all sorts of roots cut into short 
lengths or punched into shapes, with a few mushrooms. 
When cooked, throw them into a stew-pan in which you 
have made a rottr, and let them simmer. 

Meanwhile, fry your cutlets in butter, arrange them 
on a hot dish, and pour over them your ragoiit of vege- 
tables. Of course, you can only employ such vegetables 
as take the same time to cook; any others must be 
cooked apart, as also should potatoes, if used. Proceed 
in exactly the same way with Veal- Cutlets or Pork- Chops 
a la Jardinikre* 

Sheeps* Trotters. You can procure these of your 
butcher ready cleaned and scalded, fit for cooking. 
Keep them steeped in cold water until you set them on 
ihe fire. Boil them until enough done, which will take 
from four to five hours at least ; the test of which is the 
bones coming away easily from the flesh and tendon& 
If over-done, they become flabby and insipid. With a 
knife and fork take out all the bones, and cut up the 
•eatable part which is left into morsels of handsome shape 
and convenient size to serve with a dessert-spoon. So 
prepared, the trotters may be set aside, to be finished 
oS in any form which it may be wished to give to them* 

As the boilings of the trotters make good stock- 
broth for soup and other purposes, an hour before they 
are boiled enough you may add the usual soup vegc- 



372 UUTTOK ASD lAXB. 

tables, u e. carrots, oiiions, leeks, turnips, celery, with a 
bouquet of sweet herbs, and a few cloves and pepper- 
corns; all of which will improve the flavour of the trot- 
ters themselves. 

Pieda de Mouton h la Foulette — Slieepa* Feet h la 
Pofulette. Take a little of the stock in a stew-pan. 
Thicken it with yolk of egg, cream or milk, butter, and 
a very little flour. Add pepper or cayenne, lemon-juice 
or chili vinegar, salt, white onions boiled tender and 
well mashed, and a few button mushrooms. Heat the 
prepared trotters in this, and serve with just enough of 
the sauce, well boiled up and thickened, to cover them. 
Thk dUh is largely consumed in Paris. 

Another vnay. Put a good lump of butter into a 
stew-pan. As it melts, stir in a table-spoonful of flour. 
Add a little cream, to give the indispensable whiteness, 
pepper and salt, and dilute with your stock to the re- 
quired consistency. When it boils, throw in some finely 
chopped parsley, in the same proportion as for parsley 
and butter. When your trotters have been thoroughly 
warmed in this (ofi* the fire), give a final boil up, and 
serve. N.B. In mountainous countries and other dis- 
tricts where veal is scarce, sheeps' trotters are employed 
to imitate calf's head; either plain, with brain sauce 
seasoned with sage, ox a la Tortue^ with the usual ao- 
oompaniments. They may even be made to furnish 
very fair Mock Mock-Turtle. 

Boast Leg of Lamh (or other small joint of meat), 
done in a Saucepan. You hear, in France, of a leg of 
mutton being " r6ti devant le feu" — roasted before the 



MUTTON AND LAMB. 373 

fire, and '^^roii a la ca8serol6"-7roasted in a saucepan; 
and both are very good. They will tell you that onrs is 
the ooontry for splendid roasts, when you slaughter your 
holocaost ; but for a little bit, good sense and economy 
forbid! However good a cut out of twelve or twenty 
pounds of beef may be, we must admit that Sunday's 
roast, Monday's cold, Tuesday's hash, Wednesday's 
mince, and Thursday's broth made firom the bones, is 
enough to send any man to dine at a dub. 

Therefore should ladies who love their lords know 
something about roasting in a casserole or saucepan. 
You must have a very poor fire. This supposes that 
you have nothing more than an ordinary Htchen-range ; 
at which, with care, you may manage to do it success- 
fully. But a good fire will be fatal to the operation. 
It must be dear, and yet produce but a moderate heat. 

" O'er the pale emben of a dying fire, 

His little lampe fed with but little oile, 
The Curate sate, for seaatie was his hire. 
And ruminated sad the morrowe's toile." 

This is just the fire at which to roast in a saucepan. 
As, in consequence of early habits, you will only gra- 
dually renounce large joints, begin with a leg of lamb, 
if you have an oval iron pot for it (or a copper one) ; a 
tin one is out of the question. 

Put in a spoonful of dripping ; when melted, place 
the meat in the pot, sprinkled with a little salt; shut 
down the lid, and leave it over the fire on the trivet 
Shake it up from time to time, to prevent it from burn- 
ing ; turn it over and over, that it may be done equally. 



374 MUTTON AND LAMB. 

Should there not be sufficient moisture, add a little &t ; 
but it will rarely be needed. 

When you consider the joint done, there will always 
be superfluous grease to pour off. After placing the 
meat on a hot dish, add a little water or stock to the 
grease, gradually mixing in a spoonful of flour; season 
with a dust of pepper and salt, or a dessert-spoonful of 
ketchup or Harvey's sauce ; boil up, and it will form a 
nice gravy, which, after straining, you may pour over 
the meat ; and it is ready for table. 

By this method, all the juice and flavour is con* 
eentrated in the meat ; none can evaporate. The food 
BO cooked is consequently more nourishing. If properly 
done, it looh like a joint roasted before the fire. An 
experienced person may discover the difierence, but 
many prefer the former. The advantage in the saying 
of fuel is immense. In one instance, you want the 
fiercest fire ; in the other, the contrary. For veal, this 
method is incomparably the best, and for all meats much 
to be preferred in a small family. When adopted as a 
regular system, cold meat is so thoroughly abolished 
that, very often, it is only by great good management 
that you can ever have a nice little bit cold for break- 
fast — London Society.

stirring it in gradaally. Add yonr haricots (fresh, in 
summer ; if dried, thej must have been steeped all night), 
with pepper, salt, thyme, bay-leaf, and a morsel of gar- 
lic. Let all simmer together for three or four hours. 

Harricoed Mutton. Cut up a breast or a neck of 
mutton into pieces ; brown them with butter in a stew- 
pan over a brisk fire. When nicely fftltj take them out 
and drain. 

Peel and slice some turnips, and fry them also to a 
light brown on both sides ; put them into your harrico ; 
moisten with broth, adding pepper, salt, parsley, onions, 
cloves, and bay-lea£ Stew for half an hour, and take 
off the fat. Kthe sauce is too thin, reduce it by boiling. 
Pile your harrico in the middle of the dish, and lay the 
turnips round it 

The turnips in the harrico may be replaced by salsify, 
potatoes, or carrots. 

Mutton is converted into Mock Venison by marinad- 
ing with wine, vinegar, spice, and aromatic herbs. 

Sashed Mutton. Cut the least done parts of cold 
roast mutton into small, neat slices, trimming off any

in the least Dust these slices on each side with flour, 
pepper, and salt 

Fry a few sliced onions ; when brown, put them in 
your stew-pan with a little broth. Crush in a teacup 
half a pickled walnut with a dessert-spoonful of Harvey ^s

spoonful of currant jelly instead, and adding a bouquet 
of thyme, basil, and marioram, and seasoning a Uttle

Mock Hashed Venison. 

Sheeps* Brains. In all the animals and birds that' 
are slaughtered for food, the brain is considered as a 
delicacy ; and yet that part, with us, is very often ne- 
glected. The reason may be, that large brains, as those 
of the ox, are unsightly presented whole, and require 
cooking in portions — ^which is troublesome ; while those 
of the smaller animals, game, and poultry, are too small 
to be worth collecting. And yet every body has heard 
of the prodigality of ancient Soman epicures, who 
served costly dishes of the brains of peacocks. 

Sheeps' brains, being intermediate in size, are per- 
fectly convenient to serve; in large towns, they are 
easily procured in quantity, at a moderate price ; and 
they make a light and agreeable variety to the ordinary 
routine of dishes. The great point is to dress them^m 
in substance; to insure which, they must be fresh. 
Brains, for anatomical investigation, are hardened by 
being boiled in oil ; the cook must endeavour to attain 
the same result by the sudden application of great heat 

In whatever form sheeps' brains are to be sent to 
table, they must be soaked in salt-and-water, as soon as 
received, for an hour or two, to cleanse them and draw

out the blood ; then thrown into hMing salt-and-water^ 
boiled galloping for twenty minutes, and then taken 
out to drain and cool ; when thej are ready for further 
dressing. In this state, they will keep good for a day 
or longer in quite cool weather ; but all animal medul- 
lary substance is subject to rapid decomposition, and 
should never be allowed to remain long in the larder. If 
a head is wanted to be kept for a day or two, the hrain» 
should be cooked and seasoned immediately. 

Sheepa* Brains ci la Poidette. Make the same sauce 
as for sheeps' feet. Moisten each brain with a tea- 
spoonful of lemon-juice; sprinkle it all over with sage- 
leaves and sweet marjoram, or basil, in powder, or very 
finely minced ; then heat them up together in the sauce, 
letting them simmer for twenty minutes. Arrange the 
brains on their dish, heat the sauce to the boOing point, 
and then pour it over them. 

Sheeps' Brainsy Fried. It is useless to attempt ihi» 
dish unless you can command plenty of hot fat in a deep 
frying-pan. If you can, smear the brains with beaten 
egg; roll them in bread-crumbs mixed with a little 
pepper and sage or marjoram powder ; plunge them into 
your fat when it has reached its proper temperature ; as 
soon as they are of a clear, light brown, take ihem out 
and serve. They will require little sauce besides lemon- 
juice.

VEAL. 

Although the Calf is only the nephew of the Ox, he is 
a worthy sucoessor to his undoes honours, and, in some 
points of oonvenienoe, is even his superior. He has no 
need of travel to form his character, quite moderate 
exercise being best suited to the delicacy of his con- 
stitution. The Calf, in his amiable condescension, lends 
himself to so many metamorphoses that, without any 
intention of giving ofience, we may call him the 
Chameleon of the Kitchen. Few animals present them- 
selves on our tables under such a variety of disguises. 
Large as is the number of those which are to be found 
in the range of Culinary Literature, the brilliant imagina* 
tion of an accomplished cook will furnish a still more 
lengthy succession of receipts. It is not merely the 
Calf s person, properly so called, fix)m which we derive 
the leading ornaments of our banquets ; his appendages, 
both ex-temal and in-, supply the material of excellent 
messes. 

His Head, witli the skin on, plain-boiled, with brain 
sauce, can be successfiilly sent up by a cook in her 
novitiate. All that is needed is to clean it well, to steep 
in cold water, to change the water in which it is boiled, 
after all the scum has risen (see Mock-Turtle, p. 147), 



YSAL. 381 

and to boil it enough^ without letting it fall to pieces. It 
is a dish both salatary and alimentaiy, whether hot for 
dinner or cold for supper — in the latter case, garnished 
with slices of tongue. Under its more elaborate forms 
(Mock-Turtle a la Tartue, Fried and Hashed), Calf s Head 
is worthy to exercise the skill of the possessor of the high- 
est culinary acquirements. On foreign tables, theyrat^e, 
or frill, or white part of the pluck, appears in scores of 
shapes unsuspected by the eater ; it is manufactured into 
cocks'-oombs and capon-kidneys ; it forms the substance 
of andauiUeUeSf veal sausages, white puddings, chicken- 
and-cream* forcemeat balls. The feet are the foundation 
of an infinite diversity of jellies. The tails make a soup 
or a ragoilt, which is perfect ox-tail soup for the use of 
Toung Ladies. The heart makes a dainty little dish for 
a tSte-ortSte^ or a party of three. The liver, once the 
delight of Boyalty and Boyalty's conscience-keeper,* is 
also served whole abroad, with immense approbation, as 
follows : 

CcifB Lioer Burgess ^wise^ or a la Bourgeoise 
(French). Lard the upper side of a calf's liver witli 
well-seasoned slips of bacon, and put it in a stew-pan, 
with thin slices of bacon, trimmings of veal, turnips, 
carrots, a dove of garlic, or two or three shallots, if the 
former is disliked, bay-leaves, cloves, some good broth, 
and half a bottle of white wine or good cider. Skim it 
well as it first heats ; cover it with thin slices of bacon ; 
shut down close the lid of the stew-pan, and put burning 
charcoal on the top of the lid, which should be hollow, to

receive it Take care not to let it cook too fiist. When 
it is enougb, strain the gravy through a collender; 
reduce it to one-half over the fire, thicken it with a little 
flour, and pour it boiling hot over your liver at the 
moment of serving. 

Fried Calf 9 Liver and Bacon. Slice your liver 
thin, your bacon the same. Fry your bacon first, 
enough, but not dried up or burnt ; set it in a hot dish 
on your hot iron plate, to keep it fix)m cooling. Then 
fry your slices of liver. When done, lay on a hot dish 
a slice of bacon and a slice of liver, lapping one over the 
other alternately, till the dish is fulL 

To the gravy in your frying-pan put a few slices of 
lemon-peel; dredge in a little flour; moisten with a 
table-spoonful or so of good hot stock, and half a glass 
of white wine, if liked ; season with pepper, salt, and 
lemon-juice ; keep stirring with a fork till all is brown 
and smooth ; remove the lemon-peel, and then pour hot 
over yom: liver and bacon. A few forcemeat balls may 
be laid round this dish. 

Broiled Veal- Cutlets, Procure a few nice cutlets 
from the best end of the neck of veal. Mix well 
together pepper and salt, mixed spices, bisouit-raspings, 
and well-chopped thyme, shallots, and parsley. Boll 
your cutlets in this mixture one by one, pressing them 
into it on both sides, so as to make as much of it as pos- 
sible stick to them. Then wrap them, first in very thin 
slices of bacon, and afterwards in oiled or buttered paper. 
Secure the paper with string, and broil the cutlets, so 
enveloped, on a gridiron over a fire that is not too fierce. 



TEAL. 383 

Make in a sauoepan, with batter, vinegar, and tlie 
remainder of jour mixed dressing, a sauce, to be kept 
hot till wanted. 

When the cutlets are thoroughly broiled, take off the 
paper, arrange them on a hot dish, and pour the sauce 
over them. 

Veal^CtUletSj without Bone. Cut die fleshy part of a 
leg or shoulder of veal into slices not larger than the 
palm of your hand, and not more than half an inch 
thicL Give them a few smart taps with the flat of 
jour knife to make them more tender. Dust them on 
each side with flour and a little grated nutmeg. Fry 
them in butter very quickly^ not putting them into the 
pan till the butter is quite hot. Arrange them on a hot 
dish, lapping one over the other. Make, and pour over 
them, brown gravy sauce, exactly as in the preceding 
receipt, only adding pickled mushrooms. Garnish with .' 
forcemeat balls and slices of lemon. 

If you can use up the bones for soup, the meat can 
be cut out of the neck or loin, and made into cutlets as 
above. 

Veal" CtUlets in CurUpaperSy or en Papillotes (French). 
Oijt your cutlets rather thin, and lay them on pieces of 
paper cut out much in the shape of a boy's kite. Season 
them with pepper, salt, parsley and shallots finely 
minced, and little bits of butter. Twist the paper round 
the cutlet, without covering the upper portion of the 
bone. Oil the paper outside with good salad*oil. Se 
careful to. grill your cutlets over a slow fire without any 
flame, after having laid a sheet of oiled paper over the 



384 YXAL. 

gridiron. Serve them in the paper which envelops 
them. This dish requires considerable care, and a 
charcoal fire is almost indispensable. 

CcXf^ Hearty Boiled. Salt it twelve or four-and- 
twenty hours, then wash it well ; stuff with veal stufiing; 
boil well in as little water as will cover it, and keep it 
from touching the bottom of the pot ; serve with sauce 
h la Paulettey or any other white piquant sauce. 

Calfs Hearty Roasted. Wash well ; stuff with veal 
stuffing. While roasting, if you have no cold roast- 
veal or beef gravy, baste well with butter. When 
done, with the gravy left in the latch-pan make a 
brown sauce in the way directed for Calf s Liver and 
Bacon. 

Veal Sweetbread au Blanc — Served White (French). 
Steep a couple of sweetbreads all night in cold water. 
Peel off all their thin outside skin, and set them on the 
fire in a stew-pan of cold water. When they are on the 
point of boiling, take them out, and blanch tliem in two 
cold waters, and then return them to the stew-pan in the 
water in which they were previously scalded. 

Add to this a couple of hearts of fine celeiy, a large 
onion, butter, salt, white pepper, and grated nutm^. 
After boiling for half an hour, take them out and lay 
them on a dish on which you have put a large bit of 
butter and a couple of raw egg-yolks. 

Now mix in a cup a spoonful of flour with half a pint 
of milk ; stir this into the sweetbread-boilings to make 
the sauce ; add to it the juice of lemon, and pass it 
through a strainer over your sweetbreads. 



VEAL. 



385 



The lemon which has supplied the juice may be cut 
into slices to serve for garnish round the dish. 

This is a very delicate, easy, and not expensive mode 
of serving sweetbreads. 

Mmced" Veal Cakes, Beat together a pound of lean 
minced veal, half a pound of minced veal suet, a stale 
penny roll soaked in milk, a teaspoonful of grated mace,. 
a dessert-spoonful of pepper and salt, and three eggs. 
Make this up with a little flour into small flat cake^^ 
which you will fry in butter to a nice light brown. 
Stew them for a while in good beef stock. When 
enough, arrange them on your dish, thicken and season 
your gravy, pour it over boiling hot, and serve. 

These cakes are useful as garnishings or additions to 
many made dishes. Their flavour may be varied by the 
addition of minced lemon-peel, oif of sweet herbs — as 
thyme, sage, marjoram, basil, chervil, parsley— or of a 
little chopped ham. 

Godiveau ( Veal Forcemeat) j A, Chop well together 
a pound of beef-suet and half a pound of lean veal. 
When it begins to be a little small, add salt, pepper, 
grated nutmeg, and a couple of raw eggs. Continue to 
chop a little longer ; then put the whole into a mortar, 
and pound it, after adding two more eggs, a little cold 
water, and a dessert-spoonful of fine chopped parsley. 
Boll out your godiveau on a dresser or slab dusted with 
flour, and mould it into balls with the palms of your 
hands. Poach them ten minutes in boiling water, and 
dry them in a sieve or strainer. 

Godiveau ( Veal Forcemeat)^ B, Proceed exactly as 

c 



386 VEAL. 

above, simply adding mixed spices, minced sweet herbs, 
and truffles or moshrooms. The balls may be fried (in 
plenty of hot fat) instead of being poached ; or they may 
be browned before the fire after poaching. All sorts of 
godiveaux are made with the white flesh of fowls orgame, 
in which case the beef-snet may be replaced by veal- 
kidney-suet 

This composition is employed either as forcemeat, 
or, in the shape of balls or quenelles, as a separate side- 
dish ; when, if fiied, they may be served with brown 
gravy — ^if poached, with White Sauce, Dutch Sauce, 
Bechamel, or Sauce h la Poulette. 

Roast Veal requires little comment. Underdone, it 
is unsightly, unpalatable, and indigestible ; overdone, it 
is tasteless, stringy, and innutritions. Lemon-peel and 
lemon-juice are its most appropriate seasoning and 
garnish. The great fault of English veal is, that it is 
apt to be killed too young; but whoever kills a calf 
before it is six weeks old ought to be prosecuted as a 
vitulicide.* Calves nipped in the bud at that tender 
age have nothing to yield but a few bits of insipid, 
watery, flabby flesh. At two months and upwards they 
begin to acquire the solidity, succulence, whiteness, fistt, 
rotundity, and sapid deUcacy, which constitutes their 
real glory. Without being unpatriotic, we may affirm 
that, as a rule, and on the average, French butchers offer 
better, because finer, veal for sale than EnglisL

The most elegant Boast is the Loin with the kidney 
in its nataral place. At table, the carver may cut the 
kidney and its enveloping fat into slices, may lay them 
on hot toast cat into squares, season them with pepper 
or cayenne, salt, and lemon-juice, and either send them 
round to his guests forthwith, or (especially if they are a 
little underdone, as they are apt to be) may have them 
first set for a few minutes under a bright-red salaman- 
der. Veal-kidney bears more cooking than any other 
kidney, and is even the better for it 

VeaUISdnet/ may be Sliced and SautM with white 
wine, as directed for beef and mutton kidneys. Boasted 
whoUj and by itself, it makes a nice little dish to set before 
one or two persons, if not too often repeated. We have 
already mentioned the excellent service which Cold VeaU 
Kidney is capable of rendering by filling an Omelette. 

The Legy or, as it is called in many parts of England, 
the FUlefp makes the most substantial and imposing 
JRoast of veal. Its preparation is very simple. Take 
out the thigh-bone ; fill up the vacancy with veal stuff- 
ing ; bind the joint so stuffed with string, to keep it 
round and nicely in shape ; roast slowly at first, to let 
the heat penetrate it thoroughly ; towards the close of 
the roasting, brown the outside nicely, taking care not 
to let it bum. 

Many cooks serve melted butter with roast veal, as 
^eU as a tureen of ite own gravy. 

Boast Shoulder of Vealj though mostly considered 
inferior to the Leg, is not to be despised* It even con- 
tains a greater variety than the leg in the quality of its 



388 YBAL. 

substance, there being a small proportion of fat and 
tendon mixed up with the muscle. Shoulder of veal 
should also be stuffed. Pass your knife between the 
blade-bone and the meat on its upper surface. You thus 
easily make a sort jof pocket, into which pocket pusli 
yoTur veal-stuffing. By making the opening as narrow 
as may be, there will be no need to sew it up or close it 
with string. On tlie contrary, a little delicately browned 
stuffing, protruding, will help to garnish the joint, and 
will show the carver where to find the forcemeat 

The Best End of the j^eck of Veal makes a pretty 
little Roast for a small party ; but it is usually reserved 
for cutlets. 

Hashed Cold VeaL Slice and neatly trim the roast 
meat left; dust the slices on each side with flour, pepper, 
and salt. 

Boil down the bones into gravy, with lemon-peel 
and a blade of mace. When done, pass the gravy 
through a cullender, and in it let the sliced meat stew 
gently for twenty minutes; add any cold forcemeat 
left, cut into dice, and let all stew another ten minutes ; 
season to taste with salt and lemon-juice; and serve 
garnished witli sliced lemon and toasted bread ; also 
with forcemeat balls, if there was no cold forcemeat 
to put into the hash. 

Minced Cold VeaL Cut all tlie meat from off the 
bones ; take the best pieces, fat and lean, and chop 
them fine on your chopping-board. 

Boil down the rest into gravy, with the same season- 
ing as in the preceding receipt. Pass the gravy through 



VEAL. 389 

a cullender ; return it to your saucepan ; thicken it with 
a dust of flour ; put in your minced cold meat, and let 
it simmer till the gravy is so reduced that the mince 
is only just moistened, or just not dry. Taste, then^ 
whether further seasoning is required, for the salt will 
be concentrated by the boiling down. Serve garnished 
with sliced lemon and toasted bread; or, you may 
surround your dish with a wall of delicately mashed 
potatoes, and into the middle of them pour your minced 
veal. 

This dish, nicely prepared, is very useful for invalids ; 
it is light, nutritious, inviting, and they can partake of 
it in a« small a quantity as they please. It may be varied 
by the addition of mushroom ketchup, soy, &c., or by a 
teaspoonful or less of curry-powder, in which case rice is 
the proper accompaniment 

The gravy or sauce for Minced Veal should be so 
concentrated as to form a stiff jeUy when cold. What is 
left of it may be put into a small basin or mould, as soon 
as removed fix>m table. Next morning, turned out of 
the mould, it will make a Minced-' Veal Cheese for break- 
fast or luncheon. 

Boiled Breast of Veal makes a delicate dish, which, 
though insipid for strong, is often welcome to weakly, 
appetites. It enjoys the prescriptive right of being es- 
corted by the sweetbread, also boiled. This being essen- 
tially a White Dish^ some even boil it in milk-and-water. 

The proper sauce is either Oyster Sauce, or Sauce h 
la Potdette. 

Breast of Veal (a Brown I)ish)y may be stewed either 



390 VEAL. 

whole^ or, better and more conveniently, in morsels of a 
size for helping, i. e. the brisket separated from the long 
bones, and then each divided between the ribs and at the 
joints. The brisket alone ought to make a nice little 
stew; bat every thing must depend upon the age and 
size of the calf. 

When your veal is divided into morsels, make a roux 
with butter and flour, brown in it some onions sliced, 
then put in your veal, moving it about to let the outside 
of each piece get a little coloured. Then gradually 
moisten with good hot stock ; season with lemon-peel, 
mace, pepper, and salt When the meat is about half 
cooked, put in a few whole onions, whole shallots, two 
sticks of celery ; turnips, whole, halved, or quartered, ac- 
cording to size ; young carrots, whole or large ones, cut 
into lengths ; a breakfast-cupful of green pease, if to be 
had; a large sprig of parsley, and a small one of mar- 
joram. The vegetables must be well covered with the 
stock. When they are tender and the meat is done, 
arrange the latter in the middle of a large dish, serve the 
vegetables neatly round it, removing the lemon-peel and 
the bunch of herbs ; boil the gravy a minute or two, to 
thicken if required, and pour a sufScient quantity over 
the contents of the dish. 

Knuckle of Veal (divided across, sawing through the 
bone, into three or four pieces) may also be stewed in 
exactly the same way, only it will take longer to cook 
than the Breast. Whatever is left of either the above 
will be a useful addition to the Soup-kettle. 

Calf 8 Head a la Tortue or en Tortue — Tttrtle-wise^ 



YXAL. 891 

This is one of the Fancy Dishes which accomplished 
cooks vaiy slighUy, according to the inspiration of their 
own imaginings, feeling bound to impress upon it some 
mark of their individual skiU. 

Boil a Calfs Head, with the skin on, exactlj as 
for making Mock-Turtle Soup. When done (not too 
much), remove the flesh from the bones, and divide it 
into convenient-sized pieces, each about half or one-third 
the size of your hand. Also divide the tongue into pre- 
sentable morsels to be helped with a spoon. 

Make a roux with flour and butter ; in this, brown 
some dice of sweetbread. Moisten gradually with good 
stock and two or three glasses of good Madeira or Mar- 
sala. Some cooks put in brandy instead ; but it is not 
the thing. In this Sauce warm up your calfs head, 
adding, at the same time, ready-cooked cocks'-combs, 
button mushrooms, forcemeat balls, egg-yolk balls, peeled 
olives. Season well with salt and pepper, or cayenne. 
Ton may heighten both the flavour and the colour by a 
slight dash of tomato sauce. On serving, you may also 
garnish with small ornaments made of puff-paste. It is 
customary with Paris cooks to increase the list of these 
incongruities — Heaven only knows why — with fried 
eggs, slices of fried bread, and boiled fresh-water craw- 
fish in then- shell. 

The calfs head, when boiled, may also be boned and 
served whole a la Tortue^ toithout being divided into por- 
tions ; the latter mode, however, allows greater freedom 
in the application and ai*rangement of the decorations.

but take it out before quite enougb. Let it get cold, 
leaving the bones in their place. 

When wanted to be dressed, cut it into slices about 
half an inch thick ; dust them on each side with flour, 
pepper, and salt. Fry them to a clear, light brown in 
butter. When thoroughly done, arrange tliem in your 
dish, and pour over them a brown gravy made in the

Veal Pie. Take a neck of veal ; cut it up into cutlets 
first, and then into smaller pieces. Season with pepper 
and salt Invert a cupful of good stock in the middle of 
your pie-dish, and in it arrange your pieces of meat, in- 
terspersing them with dice of sweetbread, bits of lemon- 
peel, and hard-boiled eggs cut into quarters. When the 
dish is full, pour in a few table-spoonfuls of good stock, 
seasoned to taste ; cover with the crust, and bake in an 
oven which is not too fierce. 

Veal Pie is often made with meat witliout the bones ; 
which is convenient, if to be eaten cold during excursions, 
&c. But for a family veal pie, to be eaten hot at home, 
it is better to leave the bones in, for the sake of the 
gelatine and marrow which they yield. 

Veal Fficandeau. Take a handsome piece of the leg, 
about three or four inches in thickness. Trim it into an 
oblong or oval shape ; prick its upper surface with thin 
strips of bacon. Put it into a stew-pan, with the bits of 
meat trimmed away from it, a little lean ham or bacon, 
carrots, onions, bouquet complete, whole pepper, and 



VEAL. 393 

cloves. Moisten all with just enough stock to keep 
them from burning and sticking to the bottom, basting 
the meat frequently with its gravy. 

Have ready a puree of sorrel or some cooked spinach. 
Spread a bed of this over the bottom of the dish in which 
the Fricandeau is to be served. When the veal is tho- 
roughly done, take it out of the stew-pan, and lay it in 
the middle of the sorrel or spinach, with the larded sur- 
face uppermost 

Strain the gravy left in the stew-pan (as the vege- 
tables, &c. are not to be served with it, being used merely 
to give flavour) ; return it to the stew-pan, and reduce 
it by boiling as nearly to a glaze as time will allow; 
and pour or spread it with a spoon over the veal. 

Tendrojis de Veau a la PoulettCy Calfs Tendons^ rather 
a popular dish with French cooks, are nothing but calves* 
feet divided into convenient-sized pieces, and then treated 
exactly like sheep^s feet a la Poulette. They are nicer, 
however, egged, bread-crumbed, grilled, and served with 
brown gravy and green pease. 

Blanquette^ White Fricassee^ of Veal or Lamb. The 
coarsest and most cartilaginous parts, as the brisket or 
the chump-end of the neck, are mostly used for this 
purpose. Cut up the meat into convenient-sized morsels. 
Make a white roua with flour and butter, taking care 
not to let it brown. Moisten with water or clear veal 
broth, such as that which is left after boiling a breast of 
veal or a calfs head dressed as for mock:-turtle. Put in 
your meat, with a few sliced white onions, a couple of 
shallots, a turnip chopped small, a little of the white part 



394 VEAL. 

of celeiy also chopped, a leaf or two of parsley, and a 
sprig of thjme. Season with salt, ground white pepper^ 
and a blade of mace. Let these simmer over a gentle 
fire, at such a distance from it that nothing can take 
colour at the bottom of the stew-pan. When the meat 
is quite tender, dish it with a spoon. Pass the sauce 
through a cullender, return it to the stew-pan, thicken 
with egg-yolks, add a dash of vinegar or lemon-juice, 
and pour it over the meat in the dish. 

Blanquette Sauce should be smooth, rich, and creamj, 
with enough both of the acid and the spice to relieve it 
from insipidity. 

Cold Roast Veal may be also Hashed as a BhnquetUy 
or While Fricasseej taking care to remove the brown skin 
and outside parts. 

Veal Paupiettes. Paupiettes are slices of meat, or 
fillets of fish, intended to be spread with forcemeat, and 
then either rolled up or laid one over the other like 
sandwiches. 

Cut slices of veal about two inches broad, and at 
least three inches long ; flatten and beat them with your 
cleaver till they are about the thickness of a florin. 
Spread over each slice any kind of forcemeat you prefer 
or have ready ; that for Godiveau (p. 385), for instance. 
Then roll the paupiettes ; wrap each one in a thin slice 
of bacon, and fasten it round with string. Boast them 
before the fire, wrapped in oiled paper. When cooked, 
undo the string, arrange the paupiettes in a dish, sprinkle 
bread-crumbs over the bacon, and brown them in a brisk 
oven or under a salamander. 



TEAL. 395 

Serve with brown gravy, highly seasoned. You may 
make paupiettes with any animal substance that will bear 
the rolling. 

Veal Galantine. Galantine is*a sort of meat-cheese^ 
or brawn (to be eaten cold at breakfast, luncheon, or 
supper, as a hors dCceuvre)^ properly made of fowls or 
turkey ; but as they are not always in season, and cost 
dear when they are, veal is employed as a substitute all 
the year round, even when turkey-galantine is to be had 
likewise. Lamb is also made into Galantine, but less- 
frequently, in exactly the same way. Galantine is sold, 
like ham and tongue, in slices by all the superior French 
eharciUiera — ^a word for which we have no exact equiva- 
lent, as it implies a much more artistic trade than our 
" pork-butcher." 

Completely bone a shoulder of veal. Make a force- 
meat with a portion of the flesh, by chopping up a 
pound of veal together with a pound of bacon. When 
well minced, spread it an inch thick over the veal, sticking- 
into it here and there bits of bacon, of smoked and salted 
tongue, slices of truffle, to which some add pistachio nuts. 
Season with pepper, salt, and grated nutmeg, and then 
spread on all the rest of your forcemeat 

Then roll the shoulder lengthwise, pressing the flesh 
close together. Tie it round with string ; cover it with 
thin slices of bacon ; wrap it tight in a white piece of 
linen-doth ; tie it again with string, to keep it a hand- 
some shape while cooking. 

Then put it in a braising-dish or covered ^stew-pan,, 
at the bottom of which you have laid slices of bacon. 



396 VEAL, 

Around it dispose the trimmings and the bones of the 
shoulder, a calfs foot ready boiled and split in two^ six 
carrots, eight or ten onions, one of which is stuck witli 
cloves, four bay-leaves,* a sprig of thyme, and a large 
bunch of parsley. 

Cover these with veal broth and a glass or two of 
white wine; boil well, covered with the lid, for three 
hours, or longer, according to its size. When you 
judge your shoulder cooked enough, take it out ; press 
it, to get rid of superfluous liquid, especially if you want 
it to keep a long while. Do not remove its vn:^pper until 
it is cold. 

Strain the boilings of the shoulder; beat up two or 
three eggs, and add them thereto ; put all in a saucepan 
over a brisk fire. When it boils up, stir it gently, and 
set it on one side to simmer half an hour; pass it through 
a sieve or a jelly-bag, and let it cool. When you arrange 
your cold galantine on its dish, garnish it with spoonfiils 
or slices of this jelly. 

CalfB Head^ Haaliedj White. Parboil the head, and 
cut it and the tongue into slices. Then boil the bones 
with an anchovy, a little mace, and half a nutmeg. 
When all their goodness is extracted, let the liquor stand 
to settle ; when settled, pour it off clear into a stew-pan, 
but adding to it the mace and the nutmeg. 

Put the sliced calf's head into this liquor, with a 
glass of white wine, and salt to taste. Let it stew slowly 
for about an hour. Beat the yolks of three eggs with 
half a pint of cream ; stir the mixture into the hash 
gradually, as you would boiled custard, without allowing 



VEAL. 397 

it to boil. If, after that, the sauce is not thick enough 
to your liking, add to it a piece of butter braided in 
flour. Just as you take it off the fire, incorporate witli 
it the juice of a lemon. 

The brains should have been boiled in a cloth. Braid 
them with a little grated bread, the yolk of an egg, a 
little nutmeg, salt, and fine-minced sage-leaf. Make 
them into little cakes, and fry them brown in butter. 
F17 forcemeat also into balls or cakes, and with them 
and the brains garnish the Hash.

The Hog is the only animal which beats the Calf in the 
number of dishes it supplies to our tables. Both, there- 
fore, merit the highest consideration. And, indeed, if 
the Jews of old adored the GU)Iden Calf, our Cobbett and 
his disciples all but worshiped the Pig. 

The merits of the Hog are so universallj acknow- 
ledged, his kitchen utility is so deeply felt, that it is 
needless to pronounce his panegyric here. He is the 
king of unclean animals, whose empire is universal, and 
whose supremacy is undisputed. Without the hog, 
there is no possible bacon, and, consequently, no cookery; 
without him, no hams, no sausages, no chitterlings, no 
black-puddings. The doctors only waste their breath 
while preaching that his flesh is indigestible, heavy, and 
laxative. People leave the doctors to say their say, 
who perhaps are not greatly vexed at heart that nobody 
attends to their warnings; for the pig, as the author of 
indigestions, is one of their most ancient and faithful 
allies. True, the Jews regard the Hog with horror ; 
but, though many Christians of the present day are 
veritable Jews, they do not eschew sausages the more 
for that 

Every thing belonging to the Pig is good ; no part 



POBK. 399 

of his honoured person is to be rejected. Cooks and 
ham -shop -keepers are not the only artists who are 
indebted to Iiim for fortune and fame. His bristles 
were the instrument which enabled Baphael and others 
to achieve their immortality. 

Before considering Hog's flesh bit by bit, and the 
various ways of preparing it, it will be well to lay before 
ihe reader — and that seriously — the general question of 
its wholcsomeness. For ages the subject has been 
wrapped in mystery. Only within the last few years 
has the discovery been made what the danger is, where 
it lies, and how its effects are to be averted. 

It has long been a well-known fact that Pork is not 
always wholesome food ; but nobody, as yet, was at all 
aware in what its unwholesomeness consisted. Without 
going so far back as the Law of Moses, Works on Legal 
Medicine contain a certain number of cases, in which 
preparations of pork are suspected to have caused death, 
which death was attributed to an actual poisoning. As 
a natural consequence, a German physiologist, gifted 
with a lively imagination, coolly invented Ham- Poison 
(^Schtnkenffift)y and Sausage-Poison (^Wurstffift). But 
the most expert chemists, in spite of both their zeal and 
their skill, have never been able to find the slightest 
trace of toxical matter in the pojrk they examined. It 
was not chemical analysis, but the microscope, which 
revealed the real nature of the enemy. 

More than thirty years ago the discovery was made 
that the flesh of certain animals contained minute white 
corpuscules, just visible to the naked eye. Professor 



400 POBK. 

Owen demonstrated that those white corpuscules con^ 
tained a worm rolled into a spiral, to which he gave the 
name of Trichina spiralis^ from the Greek word for a 
hair. When worms are thus enclosed in a hag, or 
" cyst," they are said to be " encysted " — a term which 
it is desirable to bear in mind, because it involves a 
most important and reassuring fact. Tliese worms 
usually exist singly within a cyst between the muscular 
bundles of the voluntary muscles. Afterwards, in England, 
France, Germany, and America, the presence of these 
encysted hair-worms was ascertained in the muscles of 
Man^ the Cat, the Crow, the Jackdaw, the Mole, and 
the Pig. It was made out that the Trichina was com- 
municated by means of the food. M. Herbs found 
the muscles of two dogs, which had been fed upon parts 
of a badger containing the worms, to be loaded with 
them. But as the animals infested by encysted hair- 
worms appeared to enjoy excellent health, the parasites 
were regarded as inoffensive, and passed, in the eyes 
of medical practitioners, as simple natural curiosities. 
Whenever any mischief arose from eating pork, it 
was the Ham -poison and Sausage -poiscn which did 
it 

In January 1851, in the neighbourhood of Ham- 
burgh, several persons fell ill after eating ham. It 
should be mentioned, that throughout Gt3rmany it 
used to be a common custom to eat ham uncooked. 
Before the discovery of the hair-worms, if you ordered 
a plate of ham at an hotel, the waiter would ask 
whether you liked it cooked or raw. Of the persons 



PORE. 401 

SO taken ill near Hambnrgh, three died; the rest 
remained for a long while in a weakly state. 

Great was the general consternation. The Schinken- 
gift had done its work. Judicial proceedings were 
instituted. Tlie butcher, who had sold the meat below 
ihe market price, was prosecuted. Long afterwards, 
bj a careftil scrutiny of the facts, M. Tungel proved 
that, in the whole of this business, the only guiliy 
parties were the trichinae. 

On the 12th of January 1860, a young woman of 
twenty was taken into the hospital at Dresden, in one 
of the wards under the charge of Dr. Walter. She had 
been ill about three weeks, and presented symptoms 
resembling those of typhoid fever. On the 27th of the 
same month she died. At the post-mortem examina- 
tion of her body, M. Zeucker (who was then pursuing 
microscopic inquiries into the muscular lesions pro- 
duced by typhoid fever) found, not what he expected, 
but, in almost all the organs, an immense number of 
trichinaB or hair-worms. Now, these trichinaB, instead 
of being encysted^ each enveloped in its own cocoon, were 
perfectly free and extremely active. This first observa- 
tion was followed by many others of the same kind, 
accompanied by symptoms differing more or less from 
the above case. 

The alarm being given, a sufficient number of cases 
were discovered to justify the name of an epidemic. 
When death ensued, the muscles were found in every 
instance to be infested with free and active hair-worms. 
There was, therefore, no more doubt about the matter. 

D D 



402 PORK. 

The presence of triclimse in the organs is the canse of 
very serious disorder. Now, it was afterwards known 
iliat a trichina takes about two months to reach the 
encysted stage, and that the man or the animal are 
out of danger if they do not sink before the enoystment 
of the worm. Hence, it became easy to understand 
why, for so long a period, trichinsB had been believed 
to be harmless ; tliey had ordy been hnown in their encysted 
state ; they had been discovered only in patients who' 
had been able to resist their action. There could be no 
misconception for the future. Before M. Zeucker's- 
observations at Dresden, chance had presented none 
but animals cured of the attacks of hair-worms ; but 
such, unfortunately, is not the general result, although 
it is occasionally. 

In February 1865, M. Langenbeck, of Berlin, 
operated on a man for a tumour on the neck. He 
remarked in the muscles of the neck a prodigious- 
quantity of encysted trichinae — the condition to which 
they arrive after a long sojourn in the flesh of ani- 
mals. 

*^ Have you not been seriously ill," M. Langenbeck 
inquired of his patient, " some little time ago ?" 

" Worse than that. Doctor," he replied ; " I have- 
been poisoned." 

Being requested to state the circumstances, he con- 
tinued : " I was inspecting, in company with several of 
my colleagues, the schools at Jessen, near Mersenbourg. 
There were eight of us in all. At breakfast we were- 
served with ham and sausage, of which all of us, except 



POBK. 403 

CTie^ partook. That one felt no unpleasant consequences ; 
the rest of us were attacked by fever ; and out of the 
seven who ate the ham, four died. Suspicion fell upon 
the inn-keeper. The authorities took the matter up ; 
the meat was analysed ; but although nothing was dis- 
covered in it, every body believed that the landlord of 
the inn had tried to poison us, and he was obliged to 
emigrate to America." 

Doctor Langenbeck smiled as he explained : ^^ The 
landlord is perfectly innocent The hog, whose flesh 
you ate, was trichinised. These are the real poisoners." 
And he showed him a morsel of his own muscle full of 
encysted trichinae. 

It is clear then, without quoting further instances, 
that the trichina has long ravaged the human frame, 
without exciting the attention of medical men. Tri- 
chinosis (infection by trichinse) is nothing new; it is 
merely the knowledge of the disease which, unfortunately, 
is of recent date. This infection is communicated to 
man by the agency of certain meats, and especially 
preparations of pork. A mouthful of infected meat 
suffices to cause the person who swallows it to be 
infested by hair-worms. 

Such being the real facts, it is wise to look them in 
the face, without needless alarm, but seriously, as a 
measure of common prudence ; and to do so, it is 
necessary to become acquainted with the natural history 
of the enemy. The transmigrations and metamorphoses 
of parasitic animals (of intestinal worms, especially) are 
80 strange, extraordinary, and often so complicated, that 



404 POBK. 

they would defy belief, were they not proved by actual 
observation. 

Who, for instance, would guess that a winged fly 
(the Astros equi, a species of gad-fly) passes part of its 
existence inside the stomach of the horse, in the shape 
of a grub commonly ca^xcd a " bot" ? Such, nevertheless, 
is proved to be the case. The female fly deposits her 
eggs on the hair clothing the knees and sides of the 
horse, to which they adhere by a glutinous fluid. In 
a few days the eggs are ready to be hatched. The 
horse, in licking himself, touches the egg. It bursts ; 
a small worm escapes from it, which adheres to the 
tongue, and is conveyed with the food into the stomach. 
There it clings to the lining of the stomach by means of 
•a hook on either side of its mouth ; and its hold is so 
£rm and obstinate, that it must be broken before it can 
be detached. There it remains aU winter long, feeding 
on the mucus of the stomach. In spring, when the 
time of its transformation arrives, it detaches itself of its 
own accord, and is got rid of in the natural way. It 
buries itself in the ground, and becomes a chrysalis, in 
which state it lies inactive for several weeks; then, 
bursting from its confinement, it assumes the form of a 
fly, and perpetuates its species by becoming the parent 
of other bots, to be reared in other horses* stomachs. 

The history of tape-worms is even more marvellous. 
The hair-worm's biography is, happily for us, com- 
paratively simple. For our knowledge of its habits 
and migrations, we are indebted to the researches of 
M. Virchow. 



PORK. 405 

The Trichina is not an infusorial animalcule^ as has 
been supposed by some, but a perfectly characterised 
worm, sometimes growing large enough to be percepti- 
ble by the unaided eye. At the outset, trichinae, like 
intestinal worms, were believed to be the result of 
spontaneous generation. And, in fact, when such 
numbers were found located in the deepest organs, it 
was natural to ask how they could get there, and the 
simplest explanation was to suppose them to be bred on 
the spot. But observation has proved that neither for 
intestinal worms nor for trichinse does spontaneous 
generation exist. M. Yirchow has removed all doubt 
that the trichinse found in the most distant and deep- 
seated organs are the offspring of other trichinse that 
have been taken into the stomach. 

After Virchow, Messieurs Luckart, Turner, and 
Claus have demonstrated that the trichina which is 
swallowed in meat is transformed, in the intestines, 
into a different creature — ^the intestinal trichina. This 
produces embryos which pierce through the lining of 
the intestines, and so penetrate to the different organs 
of the body. If the man or animal so infested do not 
die, after a time they become encysted, when they sleep 
in their shell without undergoing further metamorpho- 
sis ; to produce which, they must be eaten afresh hy same 
other animal, Kthey cannot escape by being devoured, 
there they must remain in quiet. Cysts and worms have 
been found in a state of fatty degeneration, as if they 
had died of their long imprisonment in the muscle which 
they had once infested. As before stated, therefore, the 



406 POBK. 

trichina's migrations are much more simple and limited 
than those of other intestinal worms, which there is no 
need to follow here. 

It suffices that an animal should have been infected 
by trichins for it to be able to propagate the infection. 
Figs especiallj, which devour ahnost every thing they 
find, are particularly subject to be infested by triohinse ; 
and in every case hitherto recorded, the disease has been 
consequent to the eating of pork. Herbivorous animals 
are free from all euapidon of the kind, except under very 
peculiar circumstances. For instsmce, a rabbit has 
become infested by compelling it to swallow infested 

meat 

Experiments made on birds by Dr. Cobbold have 
also had a negative result ; and this so far agrees with 
the experience of continental observers, Professors 
Pagenstecker and Fuchs, who, though they found that 
the ingested muscle trichince acquired sexual maturity 
within the intestinal canal of their avian hosts, yet never 
found young trichina in the muscles of the birds, nor 
any evidence of an attempt on the part of the escaped 
embryos to effect a wandering or active migration on 
their own account All kinds of poultry, therefore, 
and winged game, may be eaten without the slightest 
apprehension. Carnivorous animals, and especially 
those which subsist on a mixed diet, appear to be the 
most liable to entertain trichinas. It is, however, as 
stated above, possible to rear flesh-worms in herbivora ; 
although, on account of the expense, comparatively few 
experiments have been made in this direction. It is 



POBK. 407 

quite clear that, in their natural state, herbivorous 
animals can seldom have an opportunity of infesting 
themselves ; whilst the reverse is the case with swine, 
carnivorous animals, and ourselves. Looking at the 
subject in relation to the public health, Dr. Cobbold 
does not hesitate to say that a great deal of unnecessary 
fear has been created in this country. English swine 
are almost entirely, if not absolutely, free from this so- 
called disease, and not a single case of trichinosis in the 
limng human subject has been diagnosed in the United 
Kingdom. Some twenty or thirty cases have been dis- 
covered |>o«^ mortem, and it is highly probable that most, 
if not all, of these individuals liad contracted the disease 
during life by eating German pork sausages, or other 
preparations of foreign meat 

The intestinal Trichina contains about one hundred 
germs ; and by the side of those, new ones are constantly 
and incessantly being formed. Now, the creature re- 
mains in the intestine at least from three to four weeks ; 
and, reckoning only two hundred embryos as the 
produce of every female trichina (M. Grerlach states 
that five hundred is the correct calculation), it is 
evident that five thousand females are capable of en- 
gendering a million young ones. Now, these five 
thousand female trichinse can be easily contained in 
a single mouthful of meat. The danger to health is 
naturally in proportion to the number of hair-worms 
swallowed, and the symptoms vary with the region they 
invade. 

In the intestinal canal, trichinse determine gastric 



408 PORK. 

symptoms, tjrphoid fever, dysenteric disturbances. The- 
purging may become so violent as to carry all the 
parasites away with it — a most happy release I Other- 
wise, the worms are developed in swarms, and th& 
disease breaks out in all its violence. 

The febrile symptoms and the muscular irritation 
are the consequence of the exodus of the new gene- 
ration from the patient's intestine into his flesh. Ac- 
cording to the strength of his constitution, he will 
either support the attack or sink under it. It is thus 
that a patient's body may provide board and lodging 
for an enormous number of trichinae, without death 
being the result. The encysted worm is inactive, 
and health returns. Nevertheless, it would be wrong 
to conceal the fact that there is considerable danger 
whenever trichinae are swallowed in certain quanti- 
ties. We would neither exaggerate nor extenuate the 
truth. 

Persons interested in the sale of bacon, hams, and 
other preparations of pork, have gone so far as to deny 
the possibility of the infection's being communicated by 
salted and smoked meat We can have no interest in 
wishing to injure any honest trade; but a sufficient 
reply is afforded by the record of the veritable epidemics 
which Germany of late years has had to chronicle. 
The pest has been propagated by smoked sausage,, 
ham, and minced pork, at Dresden, Corbach, Plauen, 
Calbe, Magdebourg, Quedlenbourg, Rugen, Burgk,. 
Weimar, Hettstadt. In this last town, more than a 
hundred and fifly persons were taken ill, of whom seven- 



a 



PORK. 409 

and-twenty died. In more than one town tlie disease 
was introduced by one single infected pig. 

A Hamburg vessel, returning from Valparaiso in 
1863, carried a live pig on board. It was killed, and 
thirty pounds of its meat eaten fresh ; the rest was 
salted. Several of the crew (precisely those who had 
eaten the pork) fell ill. When the ship sailed into port, 
two men died, and their bodies were found to be infested 
with free and active trichinae. M. Yirchow found other 
trichinae in a portion of the salted meat How, then, is 
it possible to doubt that Trichinosis has swine's flesh for 
its origin? A negative proof is, that trichinsB have 
never been found in the flesh of sheep or homed cattle. 

In the present state of science, no specific is known 
capable of driving trichinosis out of the human frame. 
Something is wanted able to kill the trichinae while they 
still establish their quarters in the intestine. All sorts 
of things have been tried, without success. Arsenic, 
copper, mercnrjr, phosphoma, spirit of turpentine, have 
been vaunted as remedies, without justification fi:^m the 
result. Picronitrate of potash and benzine sometimes 
succeed. Empirics have recommended every imagin- 
able specific. The truth is, that the trichina resists 
extremely active agents — chromic acid, amongst the 
rest Consequently, neither brandy nor vinegar are 
preservatives against the disease, much less remedies. 
On discovering in time that trichinae havo been 
swallowed, all that can be done is to administer 
strong purgatives, which will often sweep the intruders 
out of doors. 



410 POBK. 

Bemedial measures are, first, inspection of the meat, 
wUch is troublesome. Ordinary worms or maggots are 
visible by the naked eye ; in this case we must use a 
lens — an additional trouble. But the employment of a 
microscope for a few short minutes renders infection 
almost impossible. As soon as the minute white spots, 
•characteristic of encysted trichinae, are perceived, the 
meat ought to be destroyed, and the seller warned of 
the danger to which he exposes his customers. 

Formerly, German hams were not sent to market 
imtil after six months' preparation. At the present day, 
the requirements of trade no longer admit of such tardy 
proceedings. Even in Westphalia, a rapid mode of 
smoking is adopted, which does not in the least affect 
the trichinas. Even in this case, to make sure of safety, 
recourse must be had to microscopic examination. The 
same recommendation is applicable to smoked sausages, 
black puddings, and the like. 

A second excellent preventive measure presents it- 
iself, if we could only be certain that it was efficienih/ 
performed ; namely, thorough cooking. But it is much 
more difficult to ascertain whether meat is cooked to the 
point required, than to inspect it carefully. Certain 
sausages, believed to be perfectly cooked, have been the 
•cause of accidents. In 1863, a sausage which, doubtless, 
was insufficiently cooked, made a whole family, five in 
number, ill ; one of whom, a little boy, died. 

Trichinae, assuredly, cannot bear the temperature of 
boiling water ; they even die at 34^ of Fahrenheit less 
than that temperature, or at the heat which coagulates 



PORE. 411 

albumine ; but that degree of heat reaches all the parts 
of a joint much more rarely than is imagined^ even in a 
<;hop laid over the fire on a gridiron. The superficial 
portion is really broiled, but the interior does not reach 
the heat which kills trichinse. Pork-chops are often 
«aten still pink in the inside ; the same of larger pieces, 
both roast and boiled : and yet, if only on account of 
the flavour, pork requires to be thoroughly cooked. 
Boast pork may, therefore, contain in its centre legions 
of trichinse in perfect health. Mere cooking, conse- 
quently, cannot be considered a sure and sufficient 
^arantee. 

Last year (1866), the matter became so serious, the 
French nation was suddenly seized with so intense a 
trichinophoby, that the government thought it right to 
send properly qualified persons into Glermany, to make 
inquiries. Their reports were reassuring ; based, how- 
ever, mainly on the facts that infected pigs, if they 
existed in France, were excessively rare ; and that tri- 
chinised pork, even when eaten, was less likely to be 
followed by unpleasant consequences in France than in 
Germany : because the French do not, like the Germans, 
indulge in the habit of eating raw meat ; also, because 
they have the custom of cooking all their meat thoroughly. 
But this latter reason for confidence is much more to be 
depended on in the case of boiled than it is of roast or 
broiled meats. The national taste is fast acquiring a 
relish for underdone roasts, chops, and steaks ; so much 
so, that they are picturesquely spoken of by cooks and 
waiters as eaignant — " bleeding. *' 



412 FORE. 

We will close this unwelcome topic — for the sub- 
stance of which we are indebted to M. Henri de Par- 
ville and other scientific authorities — ^with the observation . 
that it could not have been allowed to pass in silence. 
Danger is not diminished bj ignoring its existence. On 
the contrary, duty compelled the Doctor to make the 
history of the Trichina famish a prudential and pre- 
cautionary, if not a pleasant, page to the present Com- 
panion to the Kitchen. Fore-warned is fore-armed. 
And when we remember the mournful effects of the 
Cattle Plague, we may imagine the horror and dismay 
that would ensue were Trichinosis to spread over the 
land. And with free trade in dead meat as well as in 
live stock, there is no guarantee that it may not appear 
at any time. Happily, it is in every way both more 
traceable and more repressible, more easily ascertained 
and more readily ^^ stamped out," than the disease which 
has so sorely tried our herds. The microscope will 
betray its presence, and abstinence from pork put a stop 
to its progress. There is not, as in the cattle disease, 
any mysterious contagion through the agency of the 
atmosphere, or otherwise, but a material and tangible 
inoculation, which may be guarded against and destroyed 
beforehand by the application of sufficient heat in the 
process of cooking. 

To Cure Hamsj A. If tlie weather permits, lot your 
hams, when cut out, hang in a cool, dry place for a day 
or two. Then cover them with salt for two days more. 
Drain them, and for each ham take one ounce of salt- 
petre, half a pound of coarse sugar or treacle, one ounce 



PORK. 413 

of juniper-berries, one ounce of allspice, and the same 
of ground black pepper. Mix all in a quart of good 
strong beer ; boil it up, and pour it hot over the hams. 
Turn them every day, and baste them well over with 
the liquor for three weeks, more or less, according to 
the size of the hams, and the length of time they are 
intended to be kept before cooking. On taking them 
out of the pickle, dust them thickly all over with bran, 
hang them up to dry, and then smoke them to the 
degree approved. 

To Pickle a Haniy B. Boil one pound and a half of 
salt, one pound of sugar, and one ounce of saltpetre, in 
su£Scient water to cover the ham completely. When 
the pickle is cooled, so as to be no more than milk- 
warm, pour it over the ham, which is to remain in it a 
fortnight 

Pickle for Hamsj C. Mix well together, in a stone- 
ware pickling-pan, one pound of coarse salt, one pound 
of good brown sugar, half a pound of bay-salt, one ounce 
of saltpetre, and one ounce of salt-prunella. Rub this 
well into the hams ; turn and rub them every day ; let 
them lie in the pickle a fortnight, at the end of which 
time pour over one ham (if there is no more) a pint and 
a half of hot ale, and let it lie in the pickle a month 
longer, turning it frequently. It will then be fit either 
to cook green, or to send to the smoking. The above 
•quantity of pickle is sufficient for one large ham. 

Pickle for Hamsj D. Take one pound of coarse 
brown sugar, one ounce of saltpetre, two ounces of coarse 
^ay salt, and two pounds of common salt Bruise and 



414 PORK. 

mix these salts well together^ and boil thorn ten minuter 
in a gallon of water, skimming well. When the pickle- 
is quite cold, rub the ham well with it all over, then put 
it in the pickle and leave it liiere, turning it every daj 
for three weeks. 

To Pickle Breasts of Porky or Bacon^ E, To two 
pints of boiling water, put salt enough to make a brine^ 
so strong that it will float an egg. Add one ounce eacb 
of saltpetre and salt-prunella, both powdered fine^ one- 
pound of coarse sugar, and half a pint of vinegar. Mix 
them well with the brine ; put in your bacon, and baste 
it every day for three weeks. Then let it drain, cover 
it with bran, and let it smoke for another three weeks. 

To Pickle Tongxiesy F. Wash the tongue well from 
any slime that adheres to it ; let it drain ; then lay it in 
your salting-dish, and over it put one good handful of 
common salt, one ounce each of saltpetre, salt-prunella,, 
and bay-salt, all well pounded, one handful of coarse 
brown sugar, and half a teacupful of treacle. Let it 
lie a month in the pickle ; then .take it out, and either 
dry it or smoke it, or boil it as it is. Two tongues may 
be conveniently salted in the same dish. The same 
quantity of salt and sugar will be made suiGcient by 
turning them and basting them with the pickle every 
day. 

To Boil a Ham. In proportion as it is dry and long 
kept, steep it in soft water for twelve, twenty-four, or 
thirty-six hours. K very dry, to avoid extracting too 
much of its flavour, when you take it out of the water 
in which it has been steeped, you may let it lie on a 



POBK. 415^ 

dish, covered with a damp cloth, for a night or longer^ 
to allow the moisture to penetrate it. 

Set it on the fire in a large boiler, covered with 
plenty of cold water, and let it be as long in coming ta 
the boiling point as possible. This and the steeping is^ 
the true secret of making salt meat sweU in the cooking. 
Of coarse, the quality of the meat has something to da 
with the matter ; but we take it for granted that your 
cook has never to prepare any but healthy and well-fed 
meat There is a popular belief in many parts of the 
country that, if a pig is killed during the wane of the 
moon, its flesh will shrink in the boiling, and con- 
sequently be hard, unpalatable, and unprofitable ; 
whereas, if slaughtered before she has reached the full,, 
it will swell in the cooking, and be plump and tender. 
The Doctor has not fully tested the truth of the fact ^ 
for all the pigs he has fatted and killed into the house- 
have, at the instance of his housekeeper, been despatched 
while the moon was still in her crescent phases. Their 
salted flesh did^ certainly, swell in the boiling, with 
exceptions so rare, if any, that he has no recollection of 
their occurrence. 

Skim well while boiling i;p, and simmer gently for 
an hour or two afterwards. If we did not now know 
that pork is — pork, we should say simmer gently until 
the end. As it is, afler a couple of hours' simmering^ 
let the ham boil galloping for one full hour, which will 
drive the heat home to its interior. That done to your 
satisfaction, let it simmer again. The entire time of 
cooking will depend upon its size, requiring seldom 



416 POBK. 

less than four, or more than seven, hours for ihe 
largest 

When boiled enough, lift it tenderly opt of the boiler, 
laj it on a provisional dish to drain and cool, peel off the 
skin very carefully, so as not to teai* the fat beneath it 
While still warm, dust its upper surface with raspings 
of the crust of French rolls. When cold, shift it to the 
dish on which it is to appear at table, and garnish with 
fresh green parsley. Ham, served in slices, may be 
garnished with the same, and also with dice of dear 
savoury jelly made of the feet, ears, skin, &c It is a 
point of honour to cut such slices excessively thin, in 
imitation of the famous plates of ham served at the 
suppers at Yauxhall Gardens ; respecting which, tradi- 
tion says that the carver attached to tliat extinct 
establishment had attained such skill that, with one 
single ham, he could cover the whole area of the 
Gardens. 

Some cooks preserve the skin of the ham to cover 
it with while standing on the store-room shelf; but it 
neither keeps off the dust nor the flies, and it does 
disturb the crust-crumbs and other garnishing. The 
best protection for a ham in cut is either a cover of 
the finest wire-gauze, or a clean, light, coarse-grained 
napkin thrown over it while behind the scenes. 

Ham-boilings are good for nothing. Throw them 
out ; don^t give them to the poor. 

Leg of Porky Boiled, This had better come from a 
scaldedy not a bumty pig, as the skin is to be eaten. 
Salt it for a week or ten days (rubbing it with the pickle 



PORK. 417 

and turning it every day) either in common salt, or in 
any of the above pickles given for hams. When 
required, take it out, rinse it well in cold spring water, 
and let it drain. Boil it exactly in the way directed for 
hams, only for a much shorter time. About three hours 
from the time of boiling up will suffice to cook a 
moderate-sized Leg of Pork thoroughly. When once 
the boiling point is attained, the more slowly it can 
be kept up, the better; nevertheless, it must be kept 
up. 

When done, place the leg on a provisional dish to 
peel off the skin, which ought to be so tender as not to 
come away entire. When peeled, you may spot the 
surface of the fat witli patches of ground allspice (after 
the fashion of old English cook-shops) — an ornament 
not impleasing either to the eye or the palate ; or you 
may sprinkle bread-crumbs or biscuit-raspings over its 
surface, and then set it under a salamander to brown 
nicely. In either case, after transferring it to the hot 
dish on which it is to be sent to table, garnish with fresh 
green sprigs of parsley. 

The skin frx)m the ham will make a little Brawn. 
A. Dust its under surface (while hot) with ground 
allspice and pepper, and then roll it up, and tie it with 
a string, to be kept on till cold. B, Cut it into small 
pieces ; put it into a saucepan with pepper, grated nut- 
meg or allspice, and as much of the boilings as will cover 
it. Let it simmer half an hour, and then put it into a 
basin or mould. Next morning yon can turn it out on 
a small dish, and serve for breakfast. The feet, ears^ 

E £ 



418 POBK. 

taU, and otfer trimmings^ will make pork cheese by 
exacdy the same treatment 

Boiled Leg of Pork is improved by being staffed with 
parsley. Chop the parsley as fine as possible, and mix 
with it a little pepper and allspice. Insert a sharp- 
pointed knife into the knuckle-end of the leg, close to 
the bone ; let it follow the bone for nearly its whole 
length, so as just not to come out at the other end. By 
working the knife, detach the flesh from the thigh-bone,, 
so as to Ibrm a sort of pocket, into which you wiU stuff 
your chopped parsley as firm as you can ram it. The* 
leg will then be boiled and finished off as before. It 
will be mudi the better, both in flavour and appearance, 
for this stuffing of parsley, especially when cold ; and the 
orifice made, allowing the boiling water to penetrate to 
the central parts of the leg, will tend to further its 
thorough cooking. 

The BoUinga from Leg of Pork which has not been long 
salted make excellent Pease Soup, especially if the leg be- 
very earefully rinsed (or steeped in cold water a quarter 
of an hour) beforehand. They will even help to frimish 
Pease Soup a la minute — ^in Iiot haste^ to he served at the 
same dinner with the leg of pork, thus : 

Boil, vrith the leg, carrots, turnips, a parsnip, celery, 
onions. When quite tender, take them up, and chop 
them up together quite small in a basin. 

Take a packet of Ashby's Prepared Pea-Flour 
(92 Upper Thames Street, London). The directions on 
the cover of the packet are : " Well mix a spoonful with 
oold water ; then pour it into the soup, keeping it well 



POBK. 419 

stirred, and in a few minutes it wiU be fit for table." 
The Doctor's womankind followed those directions, and 
we were not satisfied with the result The pea-flour did 
not incorporate well with the broth, but sank as a 
sediment to the bottom. By further experiment, 
however, it was discovered that, by steeping the pea- 
Hour in cold loater cver^niffhty it made eacellent emooth 
ami creamy soupy quite equal to soup prepared by the 
longer and more troublesome method of boiling the 
peas. The manufacturer of the Pea-Flour will be glad 
to know this, as he can add it to his printed direc- 
tions. 

When, therefore, you are thinking of making Pease 
Soup in a Hurryy steep the pea-flour in water over- 
night. When the soup is wanted, throw the steeped 
flour into the pork-boilings, together with the chopped-up 
vegetables. Boil up for ten minutes, stirring all the 
while. Put a few toasted-bread dice at the bottom of 
your tureen ; pour the soup over it, and serve. 

Sage-leaf powder should be passed round, for those 
who like it to flavour their pea-soup with. 

Boiled Pork should be accompanied by Pease 
Puddinffy the farinaceous substance of which acts as an 
antidote to the fat of the meat, and renders it more 
digestible. 

A quart of pease, either split or whole, will make a 
nice-sized pudding. White or yellow pease will have 
the more attractive appearance; blue pease often the 
better flavour. 

Soak the pease all night in the softest water you can 



420 PORK. 

procure. Set them on the fire (tied in a cloth, not too 
tight, in order that thej may swell), in cold water, 
and boil them until they are soft enough to squeeze 
through a cullender, so as to separate the inside of the 
pea fix)m the shell, if any. Stir up thoroughly with the 
pea-pulp so obtained a table-spoonful of flour and a 
couple of eggs. The object of these is mainly to make 
the pudding hang together ; because boiled pork does not 
require to be accompanied by any thing richj but quite the 
contrary. When the pudding is well mixed, put it into 
a cloth dusted with flour, tie it tight, and boil galloping 
for three-quarters of an hour. 

Pease pudding requires no sauce, but, being rather 
unfinished in its outside appearance, may be garnished 
with sprigs of parsley. 

Slices of cold pease pudding are very good and 
wholesome to eat with cold boiled pork. 

Mem. For the sake of variety, to try Ashby's pea- 
flour for the next pease pudding we make. Boiled pork 
mnst have pease pudding with it, to supplement and 
temper its quality ; varying the form and aspect of the 
pudding will therefore be a pleasing task. 

"Why mustV^ will ask some culinary sceptic, who 
doesn't understand being dictated to. ^^ Must is all very 
well to say ; but pease pudding, if not exactly vulgar, is 
a curious relic of antiquity. Why must^ Doctor, if you 

please ?" 

For good reasons, most respected of Cooks (Pro- 
fessed). This very day,* I read in that able weekly

PORK. 421 

journal, the Gardeners^ Chronicle and Agricultaral 
Gazette^ the substance of the following little lecture : 

Every vegetable substance which we use as food 
contains (besides a large quantity of water, and earthy 
materials which would be left in the shape of ashes after 
burning) the following proximate principles : 

L Nitrogenous or flesh-forming constituents ; those 
which aid in the formation and restoration of muscle ; and 

IL Substances not containing nitrogen, as starch, 
sugar, vegetable fibre. These are fitted to support re- 
spiration or to lay on fat.* 

Now, these principles exist in very varied propor- 
tions in different kinds of plants and their products; and 
it will be found that such products are more or less 
valuable for different purposes, according as one or other 
of the desired ingredients prevail. 

Thus, Barley-meal will be found to contain 69 J per 
cent of fiit-forming elements, and potatoes only 21i per 
cent of the same. Barley-meal, therefore, compared 
weight for weight with potatoes, affords more than three 
times the weight of fattening materials. 

Again, pease (note this) contain nearly 23J per cent 
of flesh-forming matter, while Barley affords but 13, 
Wheat 14, and Potatoes only 2i per cent — figures 
which enable us to estimate the differences which pre- 
vail in this respect ; whilst in the matter of water we find 
that Potatoes contain nearly 75 — Shade of Cobbett, 
crow at that ! — Oats 12, and Pease a little over 14 per 
cent of this fluid. 

* Please do ns the farour to read again our Chapter I., Generaiittett, 



422 FORK. 

Now, as the keeping up of the muscle of an animal 
on the one hand, and duly balancing the fat-forming 
and respiratory functions on the other, are important to 
the development and well-being of aU animals, vficludr- 
ing the hiffkest, it follows that, if chemical principles and 
analysis are to be depended upon, these will give us at 
least an approximate method of estimating the relative 
value of different food materials. 

If experience soon teaches us the value of this guide 
in purchasing and selecting food for the growth and 
fattening of the inferior animals, is it not an important 
matter for Man himself, in his own personal interest, to 
consider the question, " What is Food?" 

Now, from tables mostiy compiled from Boussing- 
ault, it appears that we can only regard Potatoes as food 
in a quite diluted state, compared with which Pease are 
a highly concentrated nutriment. K, next, we inquire 
into the relative feeding value of meats^ and find Pork 
to be the lowest of all, it will at once acquaint us 
with the cogency of marrying Pease Pudding to Boiled 
Pork. 

On the other hand, we are enabled to trace how it is 
that Potatoes have become popular at the tables of the 
rich ; namely, because, mixed with a generous diet, they 
are of importance to aid in its dilution. Pease, again, 
unfortunately, have almost disappeared from the tables 
of the poor, as well as of the rich. From the latter, 
advisedly so (if they habitually eat much meat; which 
all do not) ; as, in that case, they induce flatulence or 
indigestion: but for the poor man to discard them is 



POBE* 433 

altogether unwise; as his object ia, too frequently, not 
how to obtain luxuries, but how to live. 

The Beader will do well to bear in mind that it is 
not a mere speculation, but an ascertained fiiet, tiiMi/ve 
ounces of Jtesh'/armers are required to restore the daily 
waste of the body. K these five ounces be forthcoming 
in rations of meaty to get them in addition in the shape 
of pease must tend to bring about indigestion ; and the 
inconvenience would be felt the most by those who have 
<lone growing, and by sedentary persons. But if the 
rest of the food consumed by the individual be innutri- 
tions meat, as fat boiled pork, or vegetables deficient in 
flesh-forming elements, then pease will render most wel- 
come service. 

The tables in the Food Department of the Kensington 
Museum have been arranged upon the following as- 
sumptions : 

In nutrition, the tissues of the body can only be pro- 
duced by the agency of flesh-formbbs, which are 
already (as shown in the chapter Generalities) the same 
in composition as ihefiesh to he formed. 

Different kinds of food vary much in the amount of 
ilesh-formers they contain; some, as the Leguminous 
«eeds (pease, beans, &c.), being rich in them [remember 
the fact that the Chinese manufacture cheeses out of 
pulse] ; while others, as potatoes and carrots, are poor. 

An adult labouring n^^ must have five ounces 
of flesh-formers supplied daily in food, to restore the 
waste of five ounces of the organic parts of his body. 
It therefore becomes highly important to know uiluU 



424 



PORK. 



quantities of each kind of food lie must consume^ to 

« 

supply the normal waste of five ounces ; and what would 
be the cost to him of restoring the waste by the different 
kinds of food in common use. 

Here is a Table of the present cost of Five Ounces of 
Flesh-Formers.

The different quantities of food given in this Table 
all contain the same amount (five ounces) of flesh- 
formers ; and they must be eaten as the day's supply to 
enable the labourer to do a day's work. Their relative 
cost for restoring the daily waste of tissues is the money 
paid in purchasing the amount exhibited. Experience, 
however, has taught man that he should mix his food, so 
as to insure a proper balance between the heat-givers 
and the flesh-formers, and not to depend upon one kind 
of food for the exclusive supply of either. 

It follows, then, firom the above Table that Rice, 
which is so much resorted to in times of scarcity, is 
the dearest of all food; next to it in deamess, if they 
have to be bought, rank Maize and Potatoes. When- 
ever, therefore (as at the present writing), Potatoes are 



FORK* 425 

dear to the towusman and nearly lost to the countr}^ 
cottager, some sabstitiite for them must necessarily be 
found. Bread, of course, will be had recourse to, to 
make up the deficit ; but whenever Pease are relatively 
cheap, they will be a substitute for Potatoes, as the food 
of a people, whose value can hardly be over-estimated. 

The Pea-nail has also been driven further home, in 
an admirable Paper on "The Physical Condition of the 
Agricultural Labourer," read by Mr. Henry Cox, at 
Kingscote, Gloucestershire. He holds that that class of 
men — and consequently every body arrived at the age 
of discretion — should be made acquainted with the 
principles of the Chemistry of Food. Not that they 
need be chemical manipulators ; but that they should be 
made aware of the great truths taught by men of science, 
who have made this question the study of their lives. 

They should know that, on the same principle as you 
cannot have a coat from the back of a naked man, nor 
draw blood out of a gate-post, so they cannot get the 
right sort of nutriment from bodies which do not contain 
that nutriment. They should know that strong drinks 
and tea act in the same way (though perhaps more pleas- 
antly) as the whip^that is, as stimulants — and contain a 
very small portion, if any, of really nutritious matter. 
They should know that potatoes and fat meat (though 
very good for fuel, and to keep up the animal heat and 
give food for the respiratory organs) give little or 
nothing to the muscular system, and consequently can- 
not support strength. 

They know too well already that animal food, in 



426 PORK. 

sufficient quantities to support the muscular system, is out 
of their reach ; but they should also know where to find the 
cheapest and best substitutes for this substance-— that aU 
the component parte of our bodies are originaUy derived 
from the earth by plants, and are rendered by plants in a 
fit state for the nutrition of our animal frame. Some of 
these plants give a large proportion of carbon, or &t- 
forming matter ; others give a large portion of nitrogen, 
or flesh-forming matter. 

Dr. Buckland has shown that Peaae formerly con- 
stituted an important part of the diet of the people of 
this country — ^at a time, too, when our fo]:e&ther8 were 
more hardy than ourselves. Those leguminous seeds are 
undoubtedly the cheapest and best means of supplying 
nutritious matter. Their value has been known trom the 
very earliest times;* and before the introduction of the 
potato, they formed the staple article of food of our 
soldiers and labourers, and were not then banished £rom 
the tables of the rich. Pease and other pulse, if eaten by 
themselves, will produce flatulence; but if eaten^ as they 
■should be, with potatoes, fat meat, or other earbonaceous 
-substances, such is not the case. 

An adult labourer, in full work, is estimated to con- 

* ** Then said Daniel to Melxar, Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, 
ten days; and let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink. 
Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the 
countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king's meat: 
and as thou seest, deal with thy servants. So he consented to them in 
this matter, and proved them ten days. And at the end of ten days 
their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the 
children which did eat the portion of the king's meat Thus Melzar 
took away the portion of their meat, and the wine that they should 
drink ; and gave them pulse" (^Daniel i. 11-16)^ 



POBK. 427 

some about four ounces of mnscolar tissne and ajbout 
twenfy-three ounces of carbonaceous matter, in the 
various offices of respiration, perspiration, oil for the 
joints, &c [for Man's bodilj frame is as much a machine 
— ^though infinitely more perfect — as a steam-engine] ; 
so that yon see the system requires about six times as 
much carbon as nitrogen. But the fact that pulse 
contains more than half as much nitrogenous as carbon- 
aceous matter, shows that this flatulence (which is the 
escape of waste material from a safety-valve) arises 
merely from pulse's over^nchjiess in flesh-formers, and 
not /ram any injwious gubstance in its component parts* 
And here again we see why the fat of animals should be 
4K>n8umed with pease and beans ^ and not with potatoes or 
white bread. 

An agricultural labourer one day said, ^^ Bless you, 
sir, it would be no good to have pease in our house ; for the 
ohildren would eat them aU raw, if they could get at them ; 
and we have no place where we can lock them up." But 
the very craving of children for these things shows their 
need of them. Dr. Lankester says that, to preserve 
health, there should be a certain quantity of raw food 
eaten every day ; because most of the mineral substances, 
so necessary to our existence, are washed out or other- 
wise destroyed by the cook. Hence the nutritive value 
of Broths and Soups, which retain in their mass every 
thing that is put into tliem, except the bones and a 
portion of water and volatile oils. 

Besides the Four Elements of which all Organic 
Nature is composed — and there can be no life, animal or 



428 PORE. 

vegetable, wiihout them — ^the human body contaiiis the 
following inorganic substances; and the absence of either 
one of them endangers health and engenders disease. 
Taking the human body to weigh eleven stones, it would 
contain :

And we must obtain these salts from our daily bread, 
as presented to us through the medium of plants. Truly, 
therefore — again to quote Dr. Lankester— does the 
question of food lie at the foundation of all oUier 
questions. There is no mind, no work, no health, no 
life, without food ; and just as wo are fed defectively or 
improperly, so are our frames developed in a way un- 
fitted to secure that greatest of all earthly blessings — a 
sound mind in a sound body. 

And now let us return to our Pigs and their be- 
longings.

The Face J Cheeky or C7^ap, of small pigs, may also be 
salted and served in the same way, but is apt to be a 
little too fat for every stomach. The brains, and the 
snout and ears, which are trimmed away, will help to 
make a shape of pork cheese. Large Pigs' Faces are 
mostly pickled and smoked like hams. 

Pigs' Frt/j or Hasletj is best Bahed^ or rather 
Braised^ in a slow oven. Cut the heart and the spleen 
into slices ; the same of such portion of the liver as 
you use. Divide the frill or sweetbread into handsome, 
moderate-sized pieces, for helping with a table-spoon. 
It is needless to say that Pigs' Fry must he fresh; it may 
be used the same day on which the pig is killed, by 
throwing it into cold water as soon as it is taken out of 
the animal. 

Take a pat^-dish with a close-fitting cover ; a pudding- 
basin, covered with an old cracked plate, will answer the 
purpose for a small quantity. At the bottom lay a few 
sliced onions, and a bouquet of parsley and thyme ; on 
these place a few pieces of the frill, with pepper, salt, 
and lemon-peel ; then a few more sliced onions, with the 
slices of heart, liver, and spleen, peppered and salted ; 
then sliced onions again, with the remainder of the frill 
at the top of alL It is desirable that the dish or basin 
should not be more than three-quarters frdl of the meat 
and onions. Pour over all just enough water to cover 
them. Put on the lid, and set the dish in the oven.

When thus cooked. Pigs' Fry allows a very broad 
margin for the time that it may be kept hot without 
injury. There is no loss by burning or drying up, and 
it lends itself to various ways of serving. It may be sent 
to table as it is, in the dish, with no other sauce than 
its own gravy and a little mustard. Or the Fry may 
be taken out, laid on a hot dish, and the gravy (after 
the surface-fat has been removed) thickened with a dust 
of flour, and seasoned with tomato sauce or highly sea- 
soned aromatic pickle-vinegar, as that from tarragon 
or Indian pickle. Or, by stirring in a table-spoonful of 
curry-powder, you make an excellent Pigs^^Fry Cwrryy 
thereby at the same time assisting the digestion of a dish 
naturally rich and heavy in itself. The heart, fried, ]» 
apt to be hard ; the spleen, leathery. Slowly stewed iiu 
the oven in this way, they both become tender and frill' 
of gravy. Other roots, as carrots and turnips, may be 
mixed up with the fry from the outset ; powdered sage 
is much liked in the seasoning. Mealy potatoes, laid 
round the dish, make the most appropriate garnishing. 

Pigi Feet a la Sainte MAiehould. Tie up the Feet 
with broad tape, to prevent their falling to pieces in 
the cooking. Put them in a stew-pan with thyme, bay- 
leaf, carrots, onions, cloves, chives, salt, and a glass of' 
white wine. As they take a long time to do, they must 
be well covered with water or broth, replacing from 
time to time the quantity lost by evaporation. Let them 
simmer gently until quite tender, which will not be sooner- 
than four or five hours after they have begun to boil. 
When thoroughly done, let them cool in their liquor.. 



POBK. 431 

Untie them carefully, and let them remain until next 
day. 

When wanted, dip them into oiled butter, dip them 
in bread-crumbs which have a little pepper mixed with 
them, broil them over a gentle fire, and serve without 
any sauce, unless a lemon to squeeze over them. 

In short, things cooked a la Sainte MAiehould (and 
a great varieiy of animal food may be so dressed) are 
first boiled, often in court-bouillon, with roots and aro- 
matic herbs, and then covered with bread-crumbs and 
broiled. 

Popular preparations are Staffed Pigs^ Feety Pieds 
Fords y and TnffiedPigs^ Feet ; the preparation of which 
is the same, except that the latter are enriched with 
truffles. The former title is a misnomer, because it is 
the feet themselves which are the stuffing. They are 
boiled, all the bones removed, surrounded with sausage- 
meat, and the whole wrapped in pork-frill or in the skin 
used for containing sausages. When truffled, the black 
slices of truffle are visible through this skin. 

Stuffed and Truffled Pigs' Feet are rarely made in 
private houses, but are bought at the shop ready pre- 
pared. They furnish a side-dish held in some esteem, 
with the least possible trouble to the cook. At the shop, 
they are rolled in fine biscuit-raspings ; all she has to 
do is to set them in her oven (or in an American oven 
before the fire) for twenty or five-and-twenty minutes. 
One foot to every two guests is a liberal allowance. 

As Truffled Pigs' Feet will bear a day or two's tra- 
velling in cold weather^ an easy way of having them in

winter (their real season) is to procure them from any of 
the seaport towns on the north coast of France — Dieppe, 
Boulogne, Calais, Dunkirk — which have frequent and 
speedy communication with England — and in all of 
which there are excellent clvarcutiers. The price, there, 
of a Truffled Pig's Foot varies from a shilling to fifteen- 
pence. 

Roast Leg ofPork^ like Boiled, must have been scalded. 
The skin is then scored (without cutting into the fat 
beneath it) to form the ^^ crackle." In roasting, this 
requires to be protected by oiled paper, if the fire is very 
fierce, to be removed towards the end of the process, in 
order that the crackle may be crisp and nicely browned* 
It therefore requires considerable attention all the while 
it is roasting. 

Boast Leg of Fork is best accompanied by Mashed 
Potatoes and Apple Sauce ; for which latter, peel, quar- 
ter, and core your apples ; cut them into small pieces ; 
put them into a stew-pan with a tumbler of cider or (if 
you have none) water, the peel of half a lemon, and 
three or four cloves. Let boil till the apple is reduced 
quite to a pulp. Take out the lemon-peel, add thejuice 
of a lemon, mix and mash all thorouglily together, and 
serve very hot in a small vegetable-dish or sauce-tureen. 

Boast Leg of Pork may be stufied with sage and 
onions in the same way as with parsley. Chop the 
onions and sage-leaves finely together ; season with salt, 
pepper, and allspice, and ram them into the hole made in 
the pork to receive them. 

The Loin and the Sparerib make very nice roasts. 



PORK. 433 

The lioast BladAone (from the shoulder) of a large 
pig is also a pretty litUe dish. When Apple Sauce is 
to be eaten with either of these, they may be basted with 
cider during the roasting ; and, just before serving, their 
upper sur&ce may be sprinkled with powdered sage- 
leaf. 

Perk and Apple Pie. Procure a sufficiency of pork- 
chops, with as much of the fat removed as possible. Cut 
them each into three or four pieces, leaving the bone 
attached to the meat Roll them in flour, and season 
with salt, pepper, and allspice. 

Peel, quarter, core, and slice apples, in quantity 
(bulk) about half that of the pork. 

Invert a cup of cider (or stock) at the bottom of 
your pie-dish. At the bottom put a layer of pork, then 
of apples, and so on, finishing wiili sliced apples at the 
top. Pour in a small cupful of stock or cider. Cover 
with a good solid crust, not too rich of butter or other 
fat; and bake thoroughly in an oven that is not too 
quick. 

This old-fashioned dish is palatable and wholesome, 
and may be partaken of fearlessly by those who are 
afraid of pork in most of its other shapes. 

Pork Piey Coldj for Excurstone. Take three parts 
(in weight) of lean sparerib or loin of pork, and one of 
neck of veal. Cut all the meat of both off the bones, 
divide it into dice, and mix it together, seasoning well 
with salt, pepper, and allspice. 

Chop up the bones ; boil them together with a few 
sweet herbs till all the goodness is out of them ; strain

off the broth, and reduoe it by boiling if too much in 
quantity. 

If the pie is to appear or travel in its dish, there is 
no need to put an under crust, unless you like it If 
you do like it, or want its services, butter the inside of 
your dish, and line it with the side and bottom crusts. 
On these lay a few very thin slices of ham ; then put in 
your chopped meat, interspersing it at pleasure with 
hard eggs quartered, slices of truffle, button mushrooms, 
or small forcemeat balls. Pour in enough of the reduced 
bone-stock to moisten, but not to soak, the meat ; put 
on the top crust, and bake slowly and thoroughly. 

Next day, when quite cold, the pie in its crust may 
be taken out of its dish. 

Roast Suchmg-Pig is most conveniently Baked; 
there is no danger, then, of its felling to pieces. The 
proper preparation of Sucking-Pig is so completely a 
professional affair, that it is almost always purchased 
ready for cooking in every thing except the stuffing. 

Many people avert their eyes from the sight of suck* 
ing-pigs lying in a shop, because they remind them of 
the Massacre of Innocents. May be so; but philosophers 
will say. First, that such massacres must take place ; 
because the returns of the pig population prove that, if 
we did not eat iheni^ they would eat us* Secondly^ that 
as the massacre luxs taken place, it is the part of a wise 
' man to profit by it The thing being done, it's of no 
use crying over spilt milk. And, in fact, the presence 
of a sucking-pig at table converts an ordinary dinner 
into a feast 



PORE. 435 

Sacking-Pig is saaeed and staffed on two opposite 
principles : the sweet principle, with breiBid-crambs and 
raisins or pranes ; and the savonry principle. We in- 
cline to the latter. It may be considerably varied ; bat 
take this, which is classical : chop up his liver (previously 
boiled) with a little beef-suet, bread-crumbs, lemon-peel, 
truffles or mushrooms, sage, chives, capers, the flesh of 
an anchovy ; season with salt and Jamaica pepper, and 
bind all together with a beat-up egg. When your young 
friend has got his beUy full of this, stitch it up with 
needle and thread, lay him in a dish in the pleasing 
posture of waking repose, smear him all over with 
the freshest of butter, set him in your oven (or 
confine him in your cradle-spit), and watch him as 
oarefully as a boarding-schoolmistress does an heiress 
pupil. 

The moment ho is on the table, brown and crisp, cut 
off his head. Unless that is done forthwith, the learned 
say, his crackle will turn flabby and good for nothing ; 
in which case, better had it been for him never to have 
left his mother's teat The rest of the dissection may 
be performed at leisure — ^all down the back, and into 
quarters, affording the choice of loin, shoulder, or leg : 
all of which require high seasoning, being naturally 
insipid, oily, gelatinous, and diflicult of digestion — ^to 
be abstained from, indeed, altogether by sedentary and 
literary ladies and gentlemen. It is only the robustest 
of stomachs which can effectually dispose of sucking- 
pig ; but although the viscous quality of its substance 
resists the action of the gastric juice, and is ever apt to 



436 PORE. 

cause relaxation, we will not take u])on ourselves the 
responsibility of prohibiting it utterly. 

Plum Saucsy for Sucking-Pig. Take out the stones 
from a couple of ounces of raisins ; chop them, but not 
too small ; put them into a saucepan with a tumbler of 
cold water, a glass of wine (white or red), and a little 
grated nutmeg. When this boils, pour it over a teacup- 
ful of grated bread-crumbs, stirring till the raisins are 
evenly mixed with them ; and taking the same precautions 
as with bread sauce not to have the mixture too thick. 

Quarter Pork (u e. the quarters of a pig weighing 
from five-and-twenty to thirty pounds, and cooked entire) 
combines the tenderness of infancy with the pleasing 
elasticity of youth. The hind quarter, crackled, makes 
a delicious roast from six to eight pounds in weight. The 
fore quarter, salted for a week, may be divided into two 
most delicate boils : the very thing to accompany rabbit, 
boiled fowl, or other white meat that requires to be assisted 
by the smoothness of fat and the savouriness of salt. 

Pork-Chops, Select cutlets (cotelettes, little ribs) of 
the sparerib or loin, with as little fat about them as may 
be. Dust on both sides with pepper and salt, and broil, 
if you can ; if not, fry. They may also be egged and 
bread-crumbed. When done, arrange them round your 
dish ; and in the centre put either apple sauce, or puree 
of tomatoes, or mashed sorrel, or spinach, or chopped 
cabbage. Stewed red cabbage (which see) makes a 
nice accompaniment to put in the middle of a dish of 
Pork-Chops. 

There is scarcely any better relish and corrective to 



POEK. 437 

go with Pork-Chops than Tomato Sauce, It naturallj 
combines with, and is improved by, any gravy that may 
run from the chops ; and its purely vegetable substance 
neutralises the effects of animal fat 

Tomato sauce may be made from a pur^e of home- 
grown fruit ; but as their season in England is of but 
short duration (the close of summer), and they are often 
wanted for otlier purposes (to serve as a dish of Veffe- 
tabley which see), the cook must put her main depend- 
ence on Tomato Sauce purchased in bottles. This is 
best obtained from France, for the same reason that it 
is cheaper to import oranges from the Azores than to 
grow them in the British Isles. The excellent Tomato 
sauce which is there prepared might be sold in London 
in ninepenny and shilling bottles ; the former serving 
well for twice, the latter for three times, sauce-making. 

Take a saucepan with a tablespoonful of stock or 
good broth at the bottom. Open the bottle of sauce, 
with care that none of the wax with which it is sealed 
fall into its contents. Take out, with the handle of a 
silver spoon or an ivory paper-knife, the quantity of 
sauce required; put it in the saucepan, set it on the 
fire, and dilute it with stock to the thickness required 
(that of a thin pur^e), stirring to- prevent burning, and 
seasoning with salt, pepper, and cayenne, if approved. 
When hot, pour it between your chops, or serve sepa- 
mtely in a sauce-boat; in which latter case, the chops may 
have some other vegetable (as chopped cabbage or mashed 
sorrel) in the centre of the dish, which will afford the 
choice of a variety of sauce-flavours. 



438 roBK. 

As soon as jon bave taken from the bottle what sauce 
jou want, replace the cork, pressing it firmlj in. A 
bottle of Tomato Sauce, once opened, will not keep long, 
bot should be consumed as speedily as convenient, the 
admission of air eausing it to mould and ferment This 
is another reason for bujing rather than making it. 
Home-made tomato sauce will seldom keep. Professional 
manufacturers have the means of hermetically sealing- 
their bottles (and experienced workmen to perform the 
process), which cannot be expected to be at the command 
of private families. In the South of Europe, tomatoes 
are grown in the open fields, and brought to market by 
eart-loads. They are largely used as a vegetable, and 
for soups. A bottle of Tomato Sauce, in good veal stocky 
with a few additions at the cook's discretion, will make 
a tureen of excellent Tomato Soup*

^^ I AM a great partisan of seoondarjr causes^ and I 
firmly believe that the grand order of QallinacecB was 
created solely for the purpose of supplying our larders 
and enriching our banquets. 

'^ In fact, from the quail up to the turkey-cock, 
whereyer we meet with an individual of this numerous 
family, we are sure to find a light and savoury aliment, 
equally suitable to the convalescent* and to persons 
enjoying the robustest health* 

"For who of us, condemned by the Faculiy to 
the meagre cheer of the patriarchs of the desert, has 
not smiled on the chicken's wing, nicely cut, which 
announced that we were at last restored to social 
life ? 

"And, not content with the qualities which Nature 
had conferred on the gallinaceous tribes, we have 
contrived to exaggerate them by art, and, on the 
pretext of improving them, have made them sufier 
martyrdom. They are kept in solitude, plunged in 
darkness, compelled to eat, and so brought to a state 
oi embon'pcint^ which was not their original destiny. 

"True, this ultra-natural fat is also delicious; and 
it is only by means of these wicked practices that the

patients acquire the delicacy and succulence which 
make them the delight of the very best tables. 

^^ So ameliorated, the fowl is to the cook what the 
canvas is to the painter and Fortunatus's hat to the 
mountebank. He serves it up to us boiled, roasted, 
fried, hot or cold, whole or in portions, with sauce or 
without, boned, skinned, stuffed, — and always with equal 
and invariable success." — Brillat Savarin. 

Fatted fowls are good ; but too-fatted are not good 
— at least, in the Doctor's estimation. He recom- 
mends to those who will listen to him, young birds in 
good plight, fix)m nine to twelve months old, taken 
from their usual run, and shut up for four or five days, 
on a diet of barley-meal and water, . with a hearted 
cabbage or lettuce to pick by way of pastime, just to 
cleanse them, — for cocks and hens are very foul feeders. 
It is taken for granted tiiey have been highly fed ever 
since the day they jumped out of the shell. 

There has been a tendency of late amongst breeders 
to neglect the quality of the Jlesh of poultry. The 
English shows, exhibiting live birds almost exclusively, 
have encouraged mainly beauty of feather, purity of 
breed, lofly stature, exaggerated weight; while the 
French " Concours," or Competitions of Fat Poultry, 
have produced astounding specimens of weight and 
plumpness, but which, to speak the truth, threaten to 
ruin Poultry by monstrification. 

Cook one of these frightful fowls, never mmd 
whether it has been crammed at home or abroad, 
and what do you get? A mass of heterogeneous 



POULTRT AND GAME. 441 

flesh, half of which falls one way, the other half the 
other. The white, as compact and shining as ivory, 
slips away from the skin, which has been fed by a 
distinct supply of nutriment They are separated by 
a viscous, gluey stratum, which possesses neither the 
savour of fat, nor the delicacy of oil, nor the usefulness 
of cart-grease. 

The monstrification of fowls can only be effected by 
turning their nutritive powers in a wrong direction. 
The alimentary substances which enter their economy, 
in order to be equally distributed amongst all their 
organs and all their tissues, ought to bring to each one 
of those organs the means of repairing whatever has 
been expended. But their motionless condition, com- 
bined with the abuse of &ttening food, deposits in the 
cellular tissue which lies beneath the skin the whole 
excess of this unnatural nutrition, forming masses of 
unhealthy and detestable fat. 

Every fowl whose skin does not adhere to its flesh 
is a fowl to be left, undisputed, to the numerous inno- 
cent admirers who are taken by its size and weight. 
As poultry, its true merits have been killed by kindness; 
its ^teX;™ and guardians did not know when to stop. 
The wise provider will prefer a fowl with less loose fat 
and firmer flesh. 

Fowls, after plucking, require to be singed, to 
remove any hairs or down that may be left on their 
skin; in doing which, care must be taken neither to 
smoke nor bum them. The operation may be success- 
fully performed by holding the fowl in one hind, and 



442 POULTRY AND GAME. 

a wisp of lighted paper in the other ; but the sorest 
waj of all is over a charooal^fire, allowing the bird 
almost to lie on the embers for an instant. 

Gkune may be kept, some of it (as old pheasants and 
venison) mustj for a considerable time; but domestic 
poultry, after hanging in the meat-safe beyond a certain 
date, is neither agreeable nor wholesome. Young fowls 
do not require any long delay before cooking to make 
them tender ; old ones must be made tender by long* 
continued boiling or stewing. Consequently, there are 
few things of which fhe time of cooking varies so much 
as poultry and game. A spring 'thicken will be done 
enough in half or three-quarters of an hour ; an old 
cock or hen will take five or six hours' boiling before 
it becomes eatable. The case is nearly the same with 
leverets and hares, young and old rabbits, &c. ; which 
shows how difficult it is to give, in a book, the time 
necessary to cook this class of dishes. 

Boiled Fowl French cooks rarely boil any but 
old cocks and hens, reserving for roasting all ihat are 
roastable. The English are wise in making a more 
frequent use of this delicate and digestible mode, of 
dressing, so suitable for stomachs that are not robust 

When the fowl is trussed, put it on in plenty of cold 
water. Some cooks boil fowls in a doth to keep them 
white ; but one is apt to fancy that the fowl or the broth 
tastes of the doth. They are best kept clear in the skin 
by careful skimming. They may be tied round with 
tape to assist in taking them up. If fashion do not 
allow the liver and gizzard to be attached to the wing of 



FOULTBT AND GAME. 443 

a boiled fowl, and if the former be not wanted for sauce, 
both may be put inside the fowl, and boiled with it 
Fowls of white-feathered breeds are mostly selected for 
boiling ; but, in truth, all boiled fowls are best served 
masked, as the term is, either with a little white sauce, 
plain melted butter, or parsley and butter, which will 
conceal any of the little accidents to the skin which will 
happen in the best-regulated kitchens. 

Oyster sauce with boiled fowl is orthodox and ex* 
cellent. Parsley and butter. Bechamel, and Sauce a la 
PcuUtUy or white mushroom sauce, go well with it. 
Plain melted butter is too insipid, while liver sauce and 
piquante, or brown mushroom sauce, are more appro- 
priate with roast than with boiled fowls. 

Partridges, Bailed (trussed as if for roasting) in a» 
little water as will cover them, and accompanied by 
either bread or onion sauce, or both, make an excellent 
supper-dish, as well as a wholesome and inviting ^^ light 
solid" to set before a convalescent. It is quite a 
mistake to suppose that partridges so dressed become 
insipid and flavourless. They retain their natural 
gamey aroma, and give the weakly stomach very little 
trouble. This mode has also the advantage that old 
partridges may be simmered or stewed until they 
become tender. They may even be prepared previously ^ 
and warmed up in their own broth when wanted.

cooking, according to the temperature, the salt taking 
more rapidly in warm weather than in cold. Put your 
ducks on in cold water. When they boil, skim ; and 
soon afterwards slip in as many large whole onions as 
you will require for sauce. When the onions are done 
soft, mash them well, and heat them up again in a 
saucepan with a little milk or cream and a dust of 
l)epper. Wlien your ducks are tender, serve them 
cither ^^ smothered'^ with onions, or with the sauce in a 
separate boat; in which latter case, you may mask your 
ducks with just a little parsley and butter poured over 
them. Boiled goose is equally good, but it requires 
just a little longer salting, in consequence of the greater 
size of the bird. Both of them are suitable for weak 
stomachs which find a difficulty in digesting roast duck 
and goose.

loathing for articles of diet which, in their opinion, arc 
the very things to restore their strength. Yet the 
Doctor has known a pretty little meal to be made off 
Boiled Babbit by delicate women, who would have 
allowed a juicy roast leg of mutton to be taken away 
from table untouched by them. 

" Good morning, Mrs. Maynard," I said to a lady —

and there's some nice fish landed ; but it is quite 
impossible." 

" It is dear, certainly," Mrs. M. replied ; " but you 
know, sir, where there's a will there's a way." 

" Ah I I see it written in your face tliat you have 
just been committing an extravagance." 

^^ I don't think so at all. Mr. Mayuard's long 
voyages, and the years he spent in foreign climates, 
have, between them, made his appetite very delicate. 
Besides which, on board ship, he had often to eat what 
didn't agree with him, or else nothing at all ; so I am 
obliged to get what suits him best. This whiting is 
just the thing for his breakfast to-morrow, — ^ninepence." 

" Why, it's die price of a pound of meat 1" 

^^Tes, sir. But supposing that he couldrCt eat tlic 
pound of meat, and that he can eat the wiiiting ? And 
even if he could eat the pound of meat, and couldn't 
digest it afterwards, what would be the amount of 
benefit that he would derive from the money it had 
cost?" 

"You are right, Mrs. Maynard; you're a true

^^ Lor', sir, when a woman has got a good husband, 
isn't it natural she should think of what's most for his 
good?" 

Choose, for boiling, one or two young but full-grown 
rabbits ; truss them as if for roasting (removing the 
6yes). Leave the kidneys in their natural place ; put 
the liver and heart inside the belly. Tou may also put a 
slice or two of bacon in the belly ; fill up the remainder 
of the cavity with veal-stuffing, and stitch up the open- 
ing with needle and thread. These additions are not 
indispensable; but they are a great improvement, 
plumping out the rabbit, giving it a more portly 
■appearance, and helping to retain its natural juices. 

Set your rabbits, so prepared, over a moderate fire, 
in a boiler with plenty of cold water : and, at the same 
time, put in, to cook with them, a piece (not too thick) 
of white bacon or breast of pork that has been salted 
some eight or ten days, nicely streaked with fat and 
lean (a pound, or a pound and a quarter, will be enough), 
and previously steeped and rinsed a quarter of an hour. 

Skim well as long as any thing rises. When the 
boiling point is reached, throw in a stick of celery, three 
turnips sliced, three carrots ditto, and six or eight large 
white onions (the Tripoli and Madeira varieties are 
excellent for this purpose). These vegetables will chill 
the broth ; skim again, as soon as it returns a second 
time to the boiling point Then set on one side to 
simmer, or slacken the fire, until all is done enough ; 



POULTRY AND QAHE. 447 

which will be in aboot an hour from the first boiling 
np. 

Take np the onions, mash them as smooth as possible 
with a wooden spoon in a basin, seasoning with pepper, 
and adding a couple of table-spoonfuls of cream or milk. 
Rinse the bottom of a saucepan with a dessert-spoonfiil 
of the broth (to prevent burning) ; put in your mashed 
onions, and heat them thoroughly. Dish the boiled 
rabbits ; pour the mashed onions over them : they are 
then called Babbits Smotliered in Onians. 

Serve the bacon on a separate dish, garnished with 
parsley, and with the carrots and turnips placed sym- 
metrically round it. Slices of the bacon are to be 
oiFered to whoever partakes of the rabbit. Carve the 
rabbit, by cutting off the legs and wings, like those of a

The liver and heart of hares and rabbits are no great 
dainties, either to palate or stomach. With boils, stews, 
and civets, they are served as a matter of routine, but 
may be allowed, without regret, to fall to the share of 
the favourite cat or the faithful dog. 

N.B. Boiled liver, from any kind of bird or animal, 
cooked without salt, and chopped or crumbled fine, makes 
excellent and handy food for young gold or other fish. 
Persons who amuse themselves with pisciculture will 
derive assistance from its use. And it requires such a 
tiny morsel to give a meal to a whole shoal of fry.

Snipe Puddingy Boiled. This, although not a company 
dish, or one to be produced on state occasions, is, never- 
^jheless, a welcome introduction to family parties or 
friendly dinners. It is sure to be received there with a 
hearty greeting, unless the cook has been greatly in 
fault ; while the increasing scarcity of snipe renders it a 
mark of liberal entertainment. 

Allow a snipe for each person at table, and one or 
two more over and above that number. When plucked 
and singed, merely remove the eyes ; they must be left 
whole, vnthout emptying, as for roasting.

Sweet sounds are not unfrequently drowned in pies

all very well for cruel cats and bloodthirsty hawks to do 
what ^^ is their nature to ;'' but we ought to have some 
sense of thankfulness for the number of vermin the two

That " Turkey Boiled is turkey spoiled," is a saying

Trass the torkey as if for roasting ; staff the crop 
with veal stuffing, as usual ; you may fill the body with 
chesnuts, from which both the outer find and the inner 
skin have been carefully removed; find room for the 
liver, gizzard, and heart inside. If you do not boil it in 
a naj^in, tie it round with broad tape to help you to 
lift it out of the boiler. Set your turkey on the fire in 
pleniy of cold water ; skim all the while it is boiling up ; 
when it once boils, let it only simmer until done enough, 
the time for which will vary greatly (from one to four 
hours), depending entirely on its size and age. 1£ celery 
sauce is to be eaten with it, the celery may be cooked 
together with the turkey. 

When the simmering has rendered it perfectly plump 
and tender, serve garnished with parsley and scraped 
horse-radish. Oyeter sauce is an indispensable accom-* 
paniment, but bread sauce and onion sauce are admissible 
auxiliaries. The rump of a boiled turkey is a thing to 
quarrel about 

Turkey boilings are not particularly delicate; they 
will nevertheless make a palatable soup, with the aid of 
a little rice and a few onions and other vegetables. 

French cooks employ turkeys, which they cannot

The broth is now ready to boil the turkey in. 

Now for the turkey itself. Bone it — an operation 
for the performance of which you will have to take a 
lesson. Save the blood which comes away from it Chop 
up together the liver^ lungs, heart, and gizzard (properly 
cleaned, and with the skin peeled off), with a quarter of 
a pound of bacon, the same of veal, twenly shallots, some 
parsley, thyme, a heart of celery, pepper, salt, allspice, 
and pounded cloves. Mix these well together, adding 
the blood set aside and a teacupful of button mushrooms. 
[Those preserved in hermetically sealed tin cases answer 
perfectly.] 

Spread half of this stuffing all over the surfitce of the 
boned turkey-flesh ; on the stuffing put rows of strips of 
bacon, of bacon in thin, narrow sUces, of truffles also thinly 
sliced, and of hard egg-yolks cut in halves. Cover these 
with the rest of the stuffing. Then, first sew up the turkey 
itself into a sort of bag or pillow, with needle and thread ; 
and next, sew it up completely in a neat piece of linen dotL 

Boil the turkey, so swathed and swaddled in the 
prepared broth, for three hours. Then remove its linen 
envelope : put it in a deep dish, as near as may be of its

salty spice, and sweet herbs minced; pound all these

Spread out your boned turkey on a fine linen doth, 
with the flesh side uppermost ; spread jour stuffing over 
it to an inch in thickness; then a row of slips of 
smoked tongue, or of ham ; another of truffles ; another 
of blanched almonds, pistachio nuts, and very tiny 
pickled gherkins. Over these lay what stuffing remains. 

RoU the turkey over this stuffing ; stitch it together 
with needle and thread into an oblong shape, and in such 
a way as to enclose the stuffing completely. That done, 
cover your galantine with bacon ; wrap and roll it in a 
napkin, tying both the ends tight with string. Bind all 
outside with string, to keep it in a proper shape ; boil 
it in broth, till done enough; and serve it, as before, 
cold, in a deep dish, with the boilings, strained and re-

An excellent jelly for the galantine may be made by 
breaking up the bones and neck of the turkey, boiling 
them slowly in a stew-pan for four hours, sufficiently 
seasoned with salt and spice ; straining the liquor, re- 
ducing it till it will jelly, and then pouring it over the 
galantine with the addition of a glass of good white wine.

the bird has passed the bloom of jouth, you may use 
sausage-meat, or godiveau, or other meat stu£Sng 
instead, to impart a little more succulence to the flesh ; 
but for young turkeys, veal stuffing is preferable, as 
being more delicate. 

Procure a couple of pounds of the best chesnuts ; 
remove their outer husk and their inner skin ; boil them 
till tender, and with them fill the body of the turkey. 
The liver, gizzard, and heart may either be fiistened to 
the wings, as with roast fowl, or put inside the body ; 
the latter is a firequent practice with foreign cooks, and 
it save3 the liver from being scorched and dried up in 
the roasting. The turkey is then trussed like an ordinary 
fowl. If the fire is very fierce, the breast may be 
protected for the first hour with oiled paper, to be 
removed and allow its browning afterwards. The time 
will depend on the twofold circumstances of the age 
and size of the bird, and the state of your fire, which 
should be brisker as the roasting draws towards its 
dose. 

Serve on a hot dish, either plain, in its native beauty 
unadorned, or garnished with fresh water-cresses — ^the 
green look best by candlelight, the brown-tinged are 
preferred by the amateur. Roast Turkey may be 
accompanied by bread sauce, onion sauce, or chesnut 
sauce. Its own gravy may be sent up with it, either 
in its natural state, as it comes firom the dripping-pan, 
with the fat partly removed (if there is too much of it), 
or worked into a brown sauce at the bottom of a stew- 
pan with flour (browned), pepper, half a glass of red

wine, and mushroom ketclmp, or perhaps a litde tomato 
sauce. 

During the roasting, dredge occasionallj with a litde 
flour, and baste assiduously with the gravy that comes 
from the bird. K it is lean (or a turkey-poult), butter 
must be used to assist the basting. 

ChesmU SaucBj to eat with turkey, when it is not 
stuffed with chesnuts. Remove the outer husk from 
half a hundred chesnuts ; put them in a chesnut-roaster 
(a sort of warming-pan riddled with holes) over a dear 
fire, continually stirring and shaking them, until the 
second skin will come away easily. 

Then put your chesnuts into a stew-pa^, with a glass 
of white wine, as much good stock as will cover them, a 
good lump of butter, a heaped teaspoonful of pounded 
lump-sugar, and a little grated nutmeg. When boiled 
quite tender, but still remaining entire, put the chesnuts 
in a hot sauce-tureen ; reduce the liquor by boiling it a 
minute or two longer, and pour it over them. They are 
then fit to be sent up with the turkey. 

It is impossible to dismiss Boast Turkey with our 
blessing, without devoting a page or two to Truffles, 
which gravitate towards that bird by a law of natural 
affinity. Home-keeping English youth have no idea 
of the importance of Truffles in connection with the 
American feathered biped.* In France, the influential

been domesticated from time immemorial, being the principal avaU-

A tru£9ed pM or a tru£9ed fowl will snfiSce to soothe an

are a source of immense revenue. By their aid, many a 
farmer pays his rent, many a farmer's daughter saves 
her dowry. But in the mere financial view of the 
question, Truffled Turkeys claim special notice. It was 
calculated forty years ago that, from the beginning of 
November to the end of February, there were consumed 
in Paris three hundred truffled turkeys per day, or a 
total of thirty-six thousand. At present, the consump- 
tion is immensely increased. But say that the average 
price of every turkey so prepared was then only twenty 
francs (too low a figure), it makes seven hundred and

The animal food, which they were unable to obtain from flocks and 
herds, was furnished by the chase and the few animals which they 
had domesticated. like the Chinese, they ate a yariety of dog, called 
techichi. But their principal meat was Turkey, called totdin, which 
they reared in enormous quantities. Turkeys were a drug suflb- 
ciently abundant to cause a national surfeit. Cortes relates that the 
poultry-yards of Montezuma's palace were stocked with sereral 
thousand turkeys ; and Bemal Diaz tells how, eyery day, a couple of 
hundred were sacrificed to feed the beasts in the Emperor's menagerie; 
proying, first, that the said menagerie was yast, and, secondly, that 
turkeys then were not yery dear.

twenty thousand francs in all — ^a pretty little stun to be 
put in circulation by the partnership between a single 
species of bird and fungus. An equal amount of money 
was assumed to be laid out in the purchase of the truffled 
fowlS) pheasants, chicken, and partridges, whidi tanta- 
lise the appetites of francless men from the windows of 
restaurants, roaiMers, and charcutiers. 

The latter's displays have often caused us to observe 
that the dose relations between truffles and pigs are 
both curious, retributive, and reciprocal. Piggy was 
the first to discover the truffle, for his own private eat- 
ing. Man took the truffle away, and ate it himselE 
Man's Dog pushed the pig on one side, and helped his 
master in truffle-hunting instead The charcutier now 
unites the two old acquaintances in one common grave 
— ^the pat^, sausage, truffled pigs' feet, truffled boar's 
head, or whatever other form of combination may be 
devised. As pigs were the first to uproot truffles, so 
truffles now enjoy the sweet revenge of increasing the 
shouts of joy and triumph which are uttered over the 
carcases of innumerable pigs. It is a bloody mode of 
retaliation, especially when black-puddings are con- 
oemed« 

For the few persons who do not know, it may be 
well to state what truffles are. T%J>€r cibarium and 
Lf/eoperdcn tuber are learned names for a curious plant ; 
a fungus which grows completely underground ; a vege- 
table which has neither leaves, roots, flowers, nor stems, 
that we can perceive. Truffles have been found in 
England, in the downs of Wiltshire and Hampshire ;

thejr probably occur in many places where they escape 
observatioiiy from their subterranean habits: but as 
drought and heat are necessary to their perfection^ 
British-grown truffles are worth but little. Where the 
vine thrives, there thrive truffles ; in Burgundy, well — 
better, more to the south. About P^rigord, and at the 
foot of the Pyrenees, the truffle b^t produces its 
irregular lumps of vegetable flesh. 

There are animals that you would hardly take to be 
animals ; add there are plants that few would believe to 
be plants. The truffle is one on the latter list, as wild 
and unmanageable in its nature as it is possible to be. 
Pliny called it the excrement of the eartL It thrives 
best in a mixture of gravel and day, on spots which 
the sun occasionally (and occasionally only) bakes to 
the heat of a natural oven. Favourable localities are 
the slopes of hills, the skirts of woods, the uncultivated 
brinks of summer torrents and unrestrained brooklets, 
and the shadowy places beneath the arms of vast oaks, 
poplars, birches, and willows. Like mushrooms, truf- 
fles often make a sudden growth aft;er thunder-storms 
and heavy summer showers. It was once believed that 
storm-clouds laid them, as a hen lays eggs. 

Some say they are found more plentifully at full and 
new moon. It is clear that a night-search aKthe former 
bright period must greatly aid the dogs in finding, by 
the dew on the ground causing the scent to lie. Hogs 
were formerly used for the discovery of truffles ; dogs 
are now. A tame grunter, who knew the taste of truf- 
fles, was taken out for a rural walk; he was sure to

make a point at every spot where sayomy odours arose 
fix>m the ground ; his proboscis went to work ; a cry of 
exaltation escaped him at the moment when the dainty 
morsel was attained; then came down upon him a 
shower of thundering blows with the stick ; his master 
compelled him to relinquish his prize, and content him- 
self with a handful of acorns. 

TrufBe-dogs do not require such severe disdpline ; 
ihey are better trained and better treated. They are little 
bright-eyed, wiiy, mongrel terriers, rather inclined to 
give themselves airs. They look as if they wanted to 
let you know, ^^ You may patronise me or not, just as 
you like. I am a perfectly independent dog. J£ truffle- 
finding should happen to fiul, I can at any time earn 
my living (and a comfortable one too) by rat-catching/' 
They are taught the smell and taste of truffles ; they 
scratch the ground when they scent the black pearl 
hidden beneath ; and a few truffles are now and then 
given them for their pains. For Man's propensity to 
truffles is shared in common by dogs, foxes, wolves, 
and swine. 

But there are men who make a trade of truffle- 
gathering without any animal assistant whatever. Most 
of those with whom we have talked on the subject, refer 
the faculty (when exercised by men) to a kind of instinct, 
whidi they exercise without being able to give an ac- 
count of it As Fine-ear, in the fitiiy tale, could hear 
the grass grow, so these Fine-eyes or Fine-noses per- 
ceive or sniff the hidden tuber. They can look through 
a millstone which has tio hole in the centre. They

pretend to take rank with the treastire*disooyererB or 
water-diviners whom the mysterious agency of a hazel- 
rod conducts to their object But in this there is 
nothing really miraculous; the human mind cannot 
always retrace the steps which itself has taken. Cal- 
culating boys have given correct arithmetical results, 
which they woidd have a difficulty in working out on 
paper. 

As old experience doth attain to something like 
prophetic strain, so truffle-hunters may acquire nicely 
discriminating powers by practice. Outward symptoms 
for their guidance are far from being wanting. Where 
the gravelly surface is bare of vegetation ; where, struck 
with a stick, it gives a hollow sound ; where there are 
alight little swellings and bulgings of the soil; where 
there are certain unusual cracks ; where tiny clouds of 
minute blue flies hover constantly over the same spot, as 
if they had found a nidua for their eggs, — ^there is the 
place to search for truffles. Not, however, in too great 
a hurry : for if the ground is broken before the truffles 
are ripe, the bed suffers, even although the earth be 
returned immediately — ^truffles being, like others of their 
class, gregarious and social in their mode of growth. 
But the more numerous they are on the spot, the less 
is the volume of individual specimens. Truffles vary 
greatly in size, from two or three lines to five or six 
inches in diameter. Their average bigness is less than 
that of a hen's egg; they seldom weigh more than 
seven or eight ounces, though much heavier specimens 
are on record. The chances are that the fourte^i-pound

truffle^ seen by HftUer, was not of genaine unsopliisti* 
cated growth. As a general mle, the peasant extractors 
and the local specolatora in truffles are not oyer-scm- 
pnlons in the means they employ to pat off inferior 
merchandise. 

They easily, ibr instance^ make large truffles ont of 
little ones. The process is simple. They pin together, 
by means of thorns or small wooden skewers, a number 
of small truffles. The block of truffles once formed, they 
fill up all the ^ps with moist earth ; they cement erery 
chink, till the cluster of ordinary truffles is taken for one 
enormous monster. Truffle-fanciers swallow the bait^ 
The wonder circulates in the commercial world, and ii 
bought and sold again like the Pigot diamond. To the

Althougli truffles refuse to grow in wet land (as wdl 
as in ground that has been manured), yet rainy summers 
and wet springs are favourable to their development. 
If accounts are correct, truffles must enter the catalogue 
of plants gifted with the power of motion. It has been 
remarked that in August, when tiie truffle begins to 
ripen, it rises nearer to the surface of the soil which 
covers it It even appears to mount with an elasticiiy of 
sufficient force to cause it occasionally to come out of 
the ground into the open air. How this is effected has 
not been stated. It is generally believed that if truffles 
are once disturbed in the ground, although they have 
no root-fibres, they cease to grow, and remain stationary,

they seem to lie like a dry seed in its pod. Bat if left 
qaiet^ thej increase insensibly. 

The season for truffle-digging is firom the month of 
October to the end of December, and sometimes even 
np to February, If not gathered when arrived at ma- 
tnrity, they rot, an^ their remains serve as the meisois 
of reproducing a future generation of tubers. At the 
beginning of summer — sooner or later, according to 
the warmth of the weather — ^the little truffles are found, 
about the size of peas, reddish without, and white within. 
The subterranean peas gradually increase in bigness. 
At a later period, they are taken up in the shape of what 
are called white tniffies^ which are immature, and com- 
paratively insipid in flavour. It has always been 
considered impossible to propagate truffles by artificial 
culture. 

In England, there are not many besides French 
cooks who make use of truffles. It is only lately that 
English epicures have pronounced in their favour, and 
that their consumption has mounted beyond the merest 
trifle. All the truffles consumed in England by the 
gourmand world come from France. They are sent 
over fresh during the season, and are afterwards pre- 
served in bottles. The fresh ones may be good; but 
the chances are against the quality of those in bottles. 
In general, the English are reputed inferior connois- 
seurs in affairs of the table ; they do not stand first-rate 
as gastrosophs. Nevertheless, truffles are beginning to 
make their way. 

Toulouse, from, its position, has excellent truffles,

which are more stadiou&lj manipalated than in many 
other parts of France. The preparation of the article is 
in the hands of persons who make it up in p&t^, in 
terrines, or earthen pans eorered with grease, in pots, 
and in tin cases, with fowl or game. On listening to 
the language and the Garonienne assurance of these 
gentry, you would believe them to be in possession of 
the most advanced secrets of the gastronomic art They 
fix the price current, and despatch their circulars to 
every great person in the four quarters of the world. 
In all the towns and villages of P^rigord, truffles are 
employed as at Toulouse, with the exception of a few 
slight differences. Fowls and game are manipulated 
^^ aux truffes,'* after a preliminary cooking in boiling 
&t, a seasoning, and a spicing. But in P&rigord the 
atrociiy is committed of peeling the truffles and pounding 
the rind to enter into the composition of stufflng — a 
villanous piece of roguery, seeing that the asperities of 
the tuber do not contain an atom of its perfume. A 
great number of small towns, all situated in this part of 
France, have an enormous renown for the preparation 
of truffles in the above-mentioned forms, and also in 
galantines, or boned fowls. Some of the principal are 
— Buffec, P€rigeux, Barb^eieux, AngoulSme (where 
naughty men steep truffles in water, to make them 
weigh heavier), Limoges, Brives, Sarlat, Souillac, Ber- 
g&ac, and N^rac ; but at the last place they have been

The Alsacians, and notably the people of Strasbourg, 
have the merit of rendering due justice to tru£9es. 
Pastrycooks mostly rule the culinary art Some score 
of these personages in Strasbourg are the sole makers of 
the immense number of Iruffled goose Jiver pies which 
are dispersed throughout the face of the globe. Some 
of them are extremely rich, and consider themselves of 
no Uttle importance, in consequence of their frequent 
intercourse with nobles and millionaires. 

A singular adventure happened to one of them. A 
distinguished person from Germany gave this pastry- 
cook an order for a truffled goose-liver pat£ of enormous 
dimensions, which were indicated by making a circle 
with the finger on an unusually large dining-table. K 
historians do not err, six hundred francs, or 242., was 
the price agreed on. Four-and-twenty hours were 
allowed for its delivery ; a handsome stun on account 
was paid ; and a penalty in case of failure was fixed, 
more to insure exactitude than as any indemnity to the 
illustrious personage. The artist was by no means sur- 
prised at receiving so extravagant an order, because he 
was aware that the Gfermans are fond of setting large 
joints upon their table. It is not rare to see a whole 
roebuck figuring in the midst of a substantial dinner. 

Our pat^-maker, overjoyed beyond measure, went 
to work immediately. He suspended all his other tasks, 
slaughtered hecatombs of geese, procured the required 
supply of livers, recruited several supernumerary assist-

ants, kneaded the paste, and began b j laying the 
foundation of the pat^, which promised to assume the 
prq)ortion8 of a brewer's mash-tub. That done, and 
the circumferential wall of crust built round it, he filled 
his pat^, trimmed it, affixed the decorative architecture, 
put the top on, and added the glazing. It was already 
a charming edifice, highly finished, in the composite 
order. 

Night was fiir advanced when the exploit was com- 
pleted. It was the proudest day of his life. He marched 
in ecstasy round his marveUous work. He regaled his 
aides-de-can^ with bumpers of Bhine-wine. One thing 
alone amioyed him — ^that there would not be time to 
carry this masterpiece in triumph through every street 
of the town. 

In short, after a few moments' delay, spent, naturally 
enough, in copious libations, the oven was heated, its 
temperature tested, and at last the pat^, borne by four 
of the most eminent disciples, presented at the oven-door. 
But — overwhelming sorrow I — ^the oven-door was too 
narrow — too narrow by half I 

'^ Malediction, rage, despair I'^ they shouted, smitten 
with sudden stupefaction. " We are lost — ^undone I" 

<<The reputation of my old-established house is 
destroyed," said the chief. ^' Eall me, my friends. I 
cannot survive this blow." 

They tried in vain, in all directions, to get the pat^ 
in^-comerwise, or any how. The time was spent in use-i 
less lamentations, until the moment of delivery arrived.

agitation. So he resigned himself to fate, waited on his 
patron, and, cotton nightcap in hand, stated the unfor- 
tunate disappointment, with the humblest expressions of 
penitent affliction. The great man only laughed, like 
an apathetic German as he was, gave up the instalment 
already paid, and dismissed him with the consolatory 
advice : ^^ Mein Herr, de next time you make a grand

Ecofu>micaUy Truffled Turkey. 'For a small turkey, 
take a quarter or a third of a pound, for a large one, 
half a pound, of truffles. Large tubers are to be pre- 
ferred, with the fewest irregularities on their surface ; 
smell them, to be sure they are not mouldy. Wash 
them carefully, scrubbing off with a soft brush every 
particle of earth or grit that sticks to them ; let them 
drain and dry. Do not peel them, but slice them across 
as thin as possible. 

Skin and boil a good quantity of the best chesnuts, 
as directed for ordinary Boast Turkey. Mix your sliced 
truffles with these, and with them fill the body of your 
bird two or three days before it is to be cooked. On the 
day of cooking, fill the crop of the bird with veal stuff- 
ing, and roast as before. Send up with it its own gravy 
in a hot sauce-boat. You may accompimy your turkey 
with bread sauce and onion sauce, for the use of 
heretical epicures ; but, as a rule, the truffle admits no 
rival flavour to approach it. 

This mode, which is elegant and yet unpretending, 
will give ^ttite as liberal a taste of truffles as will be

and more than enough to satisfy manj— 'for the passion

The price of truffles varies so considerablj- from year to 
year, that no estimate can be formed of the probable 
cost of this economical dainty disL Last Christmas, the 
Doctor expended at least half-a-crown on truffles only ; 
but during the winter of 1866-7, truffles were unusually 
abundant and cheap. 

Extraoagcmtly Truffled Turkey. Take a very fine 
young cock-bird of the current year ; kill him at home ; 
pluck, empty, and singe him immediately ; and before 
he is cold, stuff him throughout, crop, body, abdomen

(cleaned as above, and with any suspicious parts of their 
surface cut out), whole, halved, quartered, sliced, 
chopped in pieces, — any how that will help you to pack his 
carcase with the precious cargo, — ^until his skin is as tight

nothing but his own proper gravy.

tmffled turkey will vary firom one to three or four pounds 
sterling) and upwards — a mere trifle for the possession 
of a culinary gem of the first water-in-the-mouth, in 
artistic setting. 

It is curious, we think — ^we don't quite exactly know; 
for truffles are altogether a paradox, a mystery, a con- 
tradiction, an enigma — but we are diffidently of opinion 
that truffles derive their renown not so much firom their 
flavour as from the quality of their substance. It is not 
the sense of taste alone which is peculiarly gratified, but 
also that of feeling, and of pleasurable action and 
exercise of the organs employed in mastication and 
deglutition. Arab couriers prevent their salivaiy glands 
from falling asleep by perseveiingly sucking pellets of 
gum. As a schoolboy, the Doctor has chewed a lump 
of India-rubber for hours together, and has often 
witnessed the performance of a similar operation, for a 
shorter period, on a mouthful of nuts. Truffle-eating 
borders upon these enjoyments, besides gently touching 
upon sundry others. 

Young people are rarely capable of appreciating 
truffles ; nor are working people. It requires an educa- 
tion to understand them properly. But for those gifted 
with the true faculty — ^respectable old gentlemen, for 
instance, who have no other thought or pleasure than 
eating and drinking— truffles are the superlative of 
edible substances. They are sought for with avidity ; 
they are devoured by the eyes before they reach the 
mouth ; their odour causes every nerve to tremble ; and

the effect on the palate of the ecstatic gonrmand is a 
sensation of ineffable delight To some palates, a slight 
amonnt of apprehensive trepidation is combined with 
the foretaste of anticipated pleasure. On first receiving 
a piece of traffle into your mouth, you are afraid it 
should turn out nasty, and it proves tolerably nice; 
you doubt whether you can chew it properly, and your 
molars succeed beyond your expectation. It coquettes 
with your palate, plays with your tongue, and challenges 
your teeth with pleasing provocation. When you have 
got it safe, you don't know whether to treat it as a bit of 
gutta-percha, a slice of crisp carrot, a fleshy mushroom, 
or a solid Brazil nut. It is the puzzle which pleases — ^the 
perplexity which proves so piquant 

With a slice of beef on your plate and a mealy 
potato, or the wing of a fowl and a few green peas, you 
go on with your meal straightforwardly enough; you 
chat your ordinary chat, and take your ordinary allow- 
ance of wine, with every-day indifference. But with a 
coal-black slice of the subterranean fungus adorning the 
prongs of your fork, you assume the right to make 
gallant speeches to your fair neighbour opposite ; you 
make ready, present, and fire your wit, if you have any, 
and find the best substitute you can, if you haven't ; you 
put middle-aged claret aside, and take to ancient port 
or Burgundy ; in short, there are truffles on the dinner- 
table. 

Are truffles indigestible? Very weighty authori- 

ies (whose wish, perhaps, is father to their thought) 

hold that they are ru^ indigestible, citing, amongst other 



POULTBT AKD GAHE; 471 

instanees, the case of Doctor Maloaet (a notorious gonr- 
mand} who swallowed trufSes enough to put an elephant's 
stomach out of order, but who still reached the respect- 
able age of eighty-six). Nevertheless, people, half whose 
teeth have emigrated, while the other half are not in 
coincident positions, should be careiul how thej masti- 
cate truffles ; otherwise, the tuber is pronounced to be 
perfectly digestible. 

Are truffles invigorating, restorative, and exciting 
food? French popular literature sets up a unanimous 
shout in the affirmative ; and yet, the matter is far from 
clear. About truffles, there is nothing proved or certain ; 
they are the Cynthias of the minute, whom you must 
catch in a cloud, and do the best you can with them 
afterwards. Our own medical attendant, whom we have 
confidentially consulted as to the constitutional effects of 
truffles, says : '^ As restoratives, truffles are almost always 
taken in combination with Tokay, Burgundy, and other 
powerful wines; it may, therefore, be the wine alone 
which produces the beneficial effect, if any. They are 
not in themselves at all exciting, any more than mu^- 
rooms, morels, laver, cheese-mould, fern-root, or any 
other dyptogamous condiment ; and yet, the^ are. You 
never dream of eating truffles when you are quietly 
supping or dining alone or in family. When you eat 
truffles, it is always at a grand entertainment, with 
abundance of succulent and high-seasoned dishes, with 
extra wine both in quantity and quality, and under the 
mental spur applied by cheerful, witty, and imaginative 
conversation. I therefore do think that, after you have 



472 POXJLTBT AKD GAMEi 

been feasting on tnii&ee, it will be only prudent to exer- 
cise all the self-oontrol and circnmspection you can." 
But he did not hint a single word about repudiating 
truffles, friendly dinners, or little suppers to a moderate 
amount. 

French cooks make a dish of Turkey Giblets, as we 
do of Groose Giblets ; but our way of trussing does not 
admit of that ; moreover, we do not want to be robbed 
of so delicate a morsel as the turkey-pinion. Those 
pinions (ailerons) they collect in quantities, to garnish 
the most incongruous di^es, as weU as to constitute a 
dish by themselves. But fancy high-flying epicures 
delighting in salmon stewed in a couple of bottles of 
champagne, garnished with glazed turkey-pinions and 
fresh-water crawfish cooked in the same nectar I Ude 
gives a receipt for a Harricot of Turkey Pinions. 

There are international diflPerences in the mode of 
carving Turkey, the mention of which must not be 
omitted. Abroad, the white flesh — ^the blanc^ and the 
brown flesh — ^the bis (the same word is used to denote 
brown bread), are held in general estimation ; although, 
as with us, ladies often prefer the white, male gastro- 
nomes the brown : but, just as frequently, both like both. 
With us, if the legs happen to be left, they are after- 
wards served either cold, hashed, broiled, or devilled. 
In French fiunily life, the legs will be openly cut ofi^, 
and set aside for fiiture usa Many coarse jokes have 
sprouted out of the practice. ^^ MaJUle^ serrez les cuisses^^

distributing them, the carver should receive the repeated

fiul, out of politeness, to pretend a faint resistance to the 
act of distribution ; but, at the bottom of their hearts, 
they are very glad that the thighs are not always ^^ shut

It is true that these droll and parsimonious tactics 
are a trait of the manners of the First Empire ; but 
every body knows that old-established ways linger long 
in the habits of a people. 

Another way of dividing a turkey at table (which is 
not only permissible, but even convenient, when a small 
family, are quite alone) is to take from it the Bonnet 
cTEvSque^ or the Bishop^s Cap, and set that aside for to- 
morrow's use, making the remainder serve for to-day. 

With your carving-knife, disconnect the thighs from 
the fore or white-fleshed part of the bird, but leave them

This division of the bird likewise gives rise to jokes, 
often at the expense of the niggardly host. One of the 
tit-bits of the turkey is the side bone, so highly estimated 
as to be named the " Sot-Vy-laiase^'* — ^the " Fool-leaves-it- 
there. '^ It is not, as some dictionaries say, '^ the Parson's 
Nose,*' which is the Bump, but the two delicate morsels 
lying on each side of the back-bone, adjacent to the 
rump.* Now, the Sot-Vy-laiase forming part of the

in a well-fed hen, is fat, and a first-rate delicacy. So that Matron in

in the dish of what is left — in vain. " What are yon

the innocent wag. " I was only looking for a Sot- 
Py^laisse^ my favourite morsel ; but they have both 
been eaten." Whereupon, the sorely vexed host is 
obliged, in common politeness, to send for the Bishop's 
Cap back again, and, — ^unless the other relents in his 
longing, — to his shame and sorrow, cut it up. 

French cooks, in like manner, divide a Hare into 
two portions ; the fore quarters and the hind quarters. 
This division has the convenience of furnishing two 
quite distinct and different dishes at the Jirst dressing. 
Of the hind quarters, called the RdbUj and consisting of 
the two legs and the loins with the kidneys attaehed, is

strain it, and then add a little ketchup and flour well 
braided together. Make the grKvjJust boil up (not for 
a minute or two), before serving with the roast rabbit in

wine to the gravy. 

RcdibUPati. (Idem.) A veiy useful standing dish for 
reference ; may be had of any size— the larger the better. 

Have ready your rabbits, skinned and emptied ; cut 
them into joints; have also an earthen or stoneware- 
pat^-dish, with a close-fitting cover. This kind of patS 
is made without any crust. At the bottom of the dish 
lay slices of bacon, and over that a layer of minced meat 
of any kind you happen to have at hand, mixed with 
chopped parsley, chives, a large clove of garlic, mush- 
rooms, and pepper. Upon this bed lay the whole of 
your rabbits, as closely as you can pack the pieces, 
and then, the remainder of your mincemeat, and some 
more slices of bacon to cover the whole. Shake it well 
together, to settle the meat in its place. Throw in a 
glass or two of white wine ; put the cover on the dish^ 
lute it down with paste, and set it in a slow oven until 
enough. It must not be touched, to be eaten, till it is 
cold. 

Roast Fowl and Water^creBBBs. The excellence of 
this simple dish must be our excuse for noting it, rather 
as a refresher to the plain cook's memory, than as a 
receipt for her direction. 



POULTBY AND GAME. 483 

The Fowl (whether pullet, cockerel, or capon) mnst 
be quite young, and as fat (natnrall j) as may be. These 
conditions are difficult to combine, because growing birds 
seldom make much fat If lean, a very thin slice of the 
whitest bacon, laid oyer the breast, must remedy the 
defect. Truss the legs pheasant-fashion, t. e. with the 
shanks left on, but the toes chopped off. Tuck his head 
under his wing (poor thing I), after the proper twist of 
the pinion ; attach the liver and heart to one wing, and 
ihe gizzard (duly cleaned and peeled) to the other. 
Boast the dear creature with the utmost care, as if your 
life (or an advance of wages) depended on the issue. 

You have now to combine a couple of contradictions 
— ^to make tragical mirth to roar an it were a sucking- 
dove, to produce red-hot snow, to ice glowing embers. 

Have ready a lot of the tenderest, delicatest, freshest 
of water-cresses, crisp, and ftiU of sap, and yet with 
every leaflet dry. Not a dew-drop of moisture should 
adhere to them. This result is obtainable (aft;er the 
careftdlest of picking, and reiterated washings) by first 
swinging them in a salad-basket till your arm is tired 
of playing pendulum, and then suspending them till 
wanted in a coarse dry napkin tied by the four comers: 
it would be an insult to you to say, ^^ a clean dry 
napkin." 

When the critical moment arrives, and the fowl is 
done, — ^frt)thed, browned, and steaming,— on a cold dish 
lay plenty of watercresses, so as to form a green, elastic 
bed; on this bed drop your foaming fowl; send it to 
table instantly ; and if a bone of it comes away tmpioked,

you will be excusable if you set to work to pick it jonr- 
self. 

No sauce, besides its own gravy, is needed with this 
princely piece of incongruity; which was one of the few 
ornaments of Louis XIY.'s CJourt never regarded by 
rivals with a jealous eye. 

Broiled Fowly or Spread Eagle. At a quiet repast, 
you may be content with Broiled Fowl ; on a state 
occasion, you must have Spread Eagle, and two of them, 
if only to display the double head and necL For the 
former, you may cut off the neck an inch above its 
junction with the body, and remove the shanks entirely ; 
for the latter, you must retain neck, head, and all, and 
leave the legs pheasant-length. 

Broiled Fowl is the very dish for a pleasant supper, 
in company with some beloved object

could refer to no other than Chicken Broiled. It is, in 
its very essence, an intimate dish, a confidential dainty, 
a private treat. 

Binge your fowl, empty it, decapitate the head and 
neck, amputate the shanks. Split it open down the 
back, from the insertion of the neck to the rump. Lay 
it open, press it flat, and keep it fiat with the aid of 
skewers and string. 

When nicely arranged, put it into a stew-pan with 
just enough water to cover it, and a teaspoonfiil of salt 
Put in also the head and neck cut into three or four 
pieces, the gizzard, heart, liver, and the two white 



POULTRY AND GAME. 485 

kidneys, if any. Let these boil gently until the fowl is 
cooked, but slightly under-done. Take it out and set it 
aside to cool ; it may be kept in that state till next day, 
or whenever wanted. Take out also the liver and 
kidneys, cut off the wattles and comb, and take the 
brains from the head; put them aside. Let the rest 
continue to boil, to make the heart and gizzard quite 
tender, and extract aU the goodness from the head and 
neck. 

For the Satu^ to Broiled Fowl : Fry sliced onions, in 
a stew-pan, in butter ; add a little flour ; moisten with 
the boilings of the fowl, stirring to keep all smooth ; 
remove the onions ; season with pepper, salt, and grated 
nutmeg. When that is done, and you have obtained a 
creamy, thick, brown sauce, throw into it the fowl's 
comb and wattles, the kidneys, the liver cut in two, the 
gizzard cut into four, the brains, two table-spoonfuls of 
pickled mushrooms, and one dessert-spoonful of the 
vinegar from them : the mushrooms are indispensable. 
Keep your sauce hot in a bain-marie till wanted. 

Smear the upper surface of your opened and cold 
boiled fowl with oiled butter; broil it, presenting the 
under side first to the fire. When thoroughly hot 
through, turn it on the gridiron to brown the upper 
surface. When nicely done, lay it on your dish, remove 
the skewers, and pour over it the hot sauce with all its 
contents. 

Boast Duck is one of the simplest things to cook, and 
yet it is not always done well, for want of attention to 
the important point, namely, basting it continually from 



486 POULTBY AJH) GAME. 

the moment of putting it down to tilie fire mitil it is 
done. 

The Duck is trussed like the Goose ; cut off the 
pinion-joint of the wing, the feet, and the head and 
neck ; these, together with the heart, liver, and gizzard, 
will form Duck^s Giblets^ useful for soup, stews, or pies, 
and sold, like Goose Giblets, in some provincial markets, 
by themselves, without the bird firom which thej were 
taken, at so much per set of giblets. 

If you do not make giblets, you may leave the feet 
on (tucking them against the duck's back after cutting 
off the claws), and put the liver inside, with the stuffing. 
The other portions you can boil down for gravy or 
stock. 

For the Stuffing j take onions enough to fill the duck's 
inside; chop them up with a good quantity of sage- 
leaves, and season with pepper and salt. For those 
who do not like duck-stuffing too strong, its flavour may 
be moderated by using a smaller quantity of sage and 
onions, and making up for the deficiency by an admix- 
ture of bread-crumbs. It is not usual to bind this 
latter stuffing with beat-up egg, though there is no 
reason why it should not be employed. Indeed, in that 
way, a delicate stuffing can be made, with only a slight 
trace of sage and onions — -just enough to relieve it fi*om 
insipidity. 

When your duck is stuffed, tie it round with string 
above and below, to keep the legs and wings in their 
places close to the body, and the stuffing in. You may 
let it warm through, lying in the latch-pan, and basting 



POULTBY AND QAME. 487 

it with a little broth. Begin to roast at a moderate 
^stance from the fire ; dredge with flour ; then bring 
it nearer to the fire, to brown and finish off, basting 
incessantly all the while. 

Dnok roasted in a cooking-stove, or baked^ is often 
a failure, for want of this continually basting, and in 
•consequence of the dry Iieat of the oven. The skin of 
^ roast water-fowl must be kept moist with its own 
^ravy, which will render it tender and succulent ; dried 
up and parched, it acquires an oily flavour and a 
leathery consistency which are any thing but agreeable. 
Boast Duck should not be over-done. 

If the cook cannot conveniently roast her duck before 
the fire, roasting it in a stew-pan (as directed for Leg of 
Lamb, p. 372) is far better than doing it in an oven. 
TThe following are approved ways of varying this mode 
of cooking. Ducks saut^ in a stew-pan are not usually 
stuffed. 

Ducky stewed with Green Pease. After trussing your 
duck, put it in a stew-pan, with a good lump of butter, 
over a brisk fire. Keep turning it till it is nicely brown 
all over. Take it out for a few minutes, and lay it on a 
^islu 

Then make a roux, by browning a dessert-spoonfid 
of flour in your stew-pan ; stir in some stock ; and when 
it is smooth, replace the duck ; add a quart of green 
pease, with some sprigs of parsley, thyme, and sage. 
Season with pepper and salt, and stew slowly over a 
^nde fire. Serve the pease round the duck on the same 
•dish. 



488 POULTRY AND GAME. 

Ducky toith Turnips. Nearly the same as the pre- 
ceding. After emptying, singeing, and trussing yoor 
duck; with its feet tucked behind it, make a roux, and 
in it brown your duck ; then stir in a couple of ladle- 
fuls of good broth. Season with pepper, salt, and bay- 
leaf. Keep turning your duck till the liquor in which 
it is stewing boils ; then put in a bunch of parsley and 
chives or spring onions. 

In another frying-pan or stew-pan, toss up in butter 
some turnips cut into handsome slices, until they are 
fined to a bright light brown ; let the grease drain away 
from them, and put them to the duck when it is three- 
parts cooked. Then stew slowly till it is done enough. 
Serve your duck surrounded with the turnips. Thicken 
the gravy with arrowroot or flour; season more highly, 
if required ; boil up, and pour it hot over the ducL 
If you want to make this dish still more showy (espe- 
cially when you have a couple of ducks), boil sliced 
turnips till they are quite tender; drain them; mash 
them in a basin (not in a cullender), with a little pepper 
and salt, a heaped teaspoonful of powdered lump-sugar, 
and a coffee-cupfiil of rich white cream. When well 
mixed, return them to the saucepan, heat up, and 
thicken by evaporation, stirring all the while. 

On serving, spread this white pur^ over the bottom 
of your dish ; on it lay the well-browned ducks, and 
round them the browned slices of fried turnip. 

Ducky tcith Olives. Prepare your duck as before, 
trussing it to be as round and plump as possible. Bub 
it all over with lemon-juice ; brown it with butter in a 



POULTRY AND GAME^ 489 

stew-pan ; when coloured, throw in a dessert-spoonfiil 
of flour ; continue browning, and stir in a couple of 
ladleftds of soup. 

Eemove the kernels (by peeling them thick) from as 
many pickled olives as will be eaten ; scald them in no 
more boiling water than will cover them. When tlie 
duck is almost cooked, put them to it. When done, 
put the duck in the middle of the dish, serve the olives 
round it, and pour the sauce over all. 

Olives are neither digestible nor nutritious; weak 
stomachs will set them down at what they are worth — 
things to beguile the masticating organs — and princi- 
pally bestow their favourable notice on the duck itself 
and its gravy. 

WUd Ducky Widgeon^ Tecd^ Dun Birds ^ 8fc, Sfc,^ are 
simply roasted, vnthout 9caj stuffing. They may be 
accompanied by a good brown gc^Yj (or rather sauce) 
made with their own gravy thickened in a stew-pan, 
and seasoned with ketchup, red wine, cayenne, Worces- 
tershire sauce, or other condiments ; but they are as often 
eaten with no other zest than lemon-juice and cayenne. 
Sometimes, indeed, the carver renders them uneatable 
by slicing the breast and devilling it with cayenne, till 
it is as hot as — a heat which ears polite may never hear 
mentioned. If a whole party is agreed in liking this 
strange abuse of fiery ingredient, all well and good; but 
if only a single vote is doubtful, and two wild ducks are 
served, the carver may then devil one of them, and that 
on a separate dish. Wild Fowl bear over-roasting 
even worse than Tame Duck. 



490 POULTBT AND GAME. 

Wild Fowl are excellent either Baked in a Pie or 
Boiled in a Pudding. See Snipe Padding (p. 448), 
Plovers and Lapwing are capital for this latter purpose. 
The old French proverb says : 

** Qui n'a point mange Yannean^ 
N'a point mange bon morceau"— 

^^ He who has not eaten lapwing has missed a tit-bit." 

Roast Goose. Green^ or Youthful, Goose^ killed at 
any time before, say, the close of August, is much more 
^gestible than after the bird has completed its growth 
and education; what it gains then in solidity and 
savouriness, it loses in lightness. Still, Green Goose 
should not be snatched away from its honoured parents 
in too immature a state ; as it is apt in that case to turn 
out a mere lump of flabbiness, fat, and gristle. But 
taken at the right point of adolescence, trussed, stuffed, 
and roasted exactly like Duck, and accompanied by 
plenty of young green pease, it is a dish to set before— 
no matter whom. Goose requires the same precautions 
as Duck in respect to basting ; and may bask a con- 
siderable time in the latch-pan, with repeated turnings, 
before being suspended in front of the fire. 

Goose is trussed exactly like Duck, only the feet are 
never left on, but go with the giblets, which become a 
matter of consideration in a bird of this size. They con- 
sist of the head, neck, pinions, feet, heart, liver, and 
gizzard. 

Full-grown Goose is commonly stuffed like Duck ; 
but it differs from its smaller cousin in being entitled 
io the honours of Apple Sauce. In that case, it may be 



POULTBY AND QA1£E. 491 

basted, at the outset, with a teacupful of eider ; then, 
when it begins to warm, dredged with flour ; afterwards 
basted with its own fat and gravj-, mixing with the eider. 
The roasting of a fidl-grown goose takes at least a 
couple of hours ; and the nearer it draws to a close, the 
more assiduous must be the basting ; the fatter the goose, 
the more liberal may be the dredging with flour. 

A French Stuffing for Roast Goose, Boast a hundred 
chestnuts, without burning them. Peel them carefully. 
Chop up half the quantity, and put tliem into a stew-pan 
with a pound of sausage«meat, a lump of butter, the 
gooseys liver chopped, and parsley, chives, shallots, and 
a clove of garlic, all chopped. Heat them up, all 
together, over the fire for a quarter of an hour. When 
your goose is singed and ready, fill it with this stuffing, 
and stitch up the flap of the belly to keep it in. 

Prepare the remainder of the chestnuts in the follow- 
ing way, to accompany the goose : Put them in a stew- 
pan with a glass of white wine, a couple of spoonfuls of 
good stock, and a little salt. Stew the chestnuts in this 
liquor until it begins to reduce and thicken, and then 
serve them round the roast goose. 

Goose en Davbej Stewed^ A, to be eaten cold. You 
will destine to this mode of embalming a bird which has 
attained a certain age, and is no longer tender enough 
to roast After emptying and singeing, truss ba for 
roasting. Take an oval or oblong boiler just big enough 
to hold the goose. At the bottom lay a few slices of 
bacon and veal ; on these lay the goose, and cover its 
breast with thin slices of bacon. Bound it put parsley,

chires, three or four shaUots, half a dove of garlic,

a quart of water, half a pint of wine, and a dram-glass 
of brandy. Cover the pot close with its lid, luting it 
down with paste, and let it stew i^eTy slowly, over a 
very gentle fire, for five or six hours ; or you may set 
it for that time in a very slow oven. 

When the goose is cooked, put it into a deep dish. 
Skim the fat off the liquor, and pour it over tlie goose,

you must reduce it to that consistency by boiling down; 

Goae en, Dauhe, Stewed^ B. Cover the bottom of

plete, cloves, onions, sliced carrots, pepper, salt, and 
blades of mace. 

Pour over it a dram-glass of brandy, a glass of white 
wine, a pint of stock, and the same of water. Close 
the lid hermetically, and stew or bake slowly, as before, 
for five or six hours. 

This may be either eaten hot, with its accompani- 
ments ; or cold, with the gravy about it, in the shape of 

jelly. 

Either of these Davbes will be found acceptable at 
breakfast, luncheon, and pic-nic parties, and deserve to 
be more generally known in England : for what better

chop the pinions, across, in two ; skin the feet (bj scald- 
ing), and cut off the claws ; cut the heart in two ; the 
gizzard (which is double), after skinning and cleaning, 
into four ; leave the liver as it is. 

Binse these well in salt-and-water ; then put them 
into a stew-pan with half a pound of rump-steak cut into 
dice, and as much good stock as will cover them ; season 
with pepper and salt, and stew till nearly tender. At 
this point, taste if the seasoning is sufficient Transfer 
the giblets, with their gravy, to the pie-dish, and set them 
aside. 

When wanted, cover them with the crust, and bake. 

Goose Giblets help a soup, or make a stew, both 
which are wholesome and agreeable. The gizzard takes 
so much longer than the other components to cook, that 
it ought to be boiled separately beforehand. 

The best giblets are Swan {ue. Cygnet) Giblets; 
but they do not fall to eveiy body^s lot. 

The poor Goose is very unjustly regarded in England 
as an emblem of stupidity. Give a dog a bad name, 
and hang him; — give a goose a bad name, and roast 
him. It is an excuse for eating him without qualms of 
conscience. ^^ Stupid as a goose,'' is an erroneous 
comparison; for the goose has intelligence, affection^ 
fidelity, and a host of virtues which shall not be enu- 
merated, for fear of taking away the reader's appetite 
the next time he sits down to our fiiend lying in state. 



494 POULTRY AND OAHE. 

Our neighbours put the dunce's cap on a head which 
fits it better. They call a stupid feUow, not a goose, but 
a dindon — a turkey. French literature swarms with 
examples. Thus : " Whoever is fond of turkey — and 
who is not ?-— cannot hate the Jesuits ; for, it is said, to 
those worthy Fathers — who were no turkeys themselves 
— ^we owe the introduction of the bird to France. . . . 
The turkey must be kept for a certain time ; but as it 
is much more difficult to ^ mortify' a fool than a clever 
man, this will be an afiair of several days, depending on 
the temperature of the atmosphere. • . . Turkey's legs* 
may be eaten a la- Sainte MAiehauld. It is said they 
tend to cause sleepiness — ^which is only natural ; for one 
is apt to fall asleep in the company of turkeys," &c. &c» 

Roasted Pheasant^ say initiated epicures, is an am- 
brosial morsel, which ought to be eaten on one's knees ; 
the paper which wraps it during the first stage of roasting 
should be a sheet of nothing less than an epic poem. 
In short, it is one of the things about which people, 
otherwise sober-minded, occasionally lose their senses. 

Young pheasant, fresh killed, is not particularly 
savoury : neither so delicate as a pullet, nor so perfumed 
as a quail ; old pheasant is tough, leathery, and dry. 
The pheasant, says Brillat Savarin, is an enigma, whoso 
solution is revealed to adepts only. 

Every alimentary substance, he discourseth, has its 
apogee of esculence. Some substances reach that turning- 
point before their full development: examples — capera,. 
asparagus, cauliflowers, gray partridges, squab pigeons, 
&0. Others reach it at the moment when they have 



POULTBY AlH) GAME. 495 

attained the fall perfection of which their organisation 
is capable, as melons and the generality of frtdts, beef, 
mutton, roe-deer, and red partridges. And, lastly, other 
things arrive at their edible point when they begin ta 
decompose ; instances of which aro medlars, the wood- 
cock, and, above all, the pheasant. Taken at the right 
moment, its flesh is tender, high-flavoured, sublime ; it 
has the delicacy of poultry and the aroma of venison. 
This happy moment is the critical point when the de- 
composition of the bird commences ; so much so, that the 
French have invented a yerh^ faimndery to express the 
act of keeping meat till it acquires a venison taste 
There are various rough methods of doing this with 
pheasants ; one is, to hang up the bird by the tail, and, 
when it falls to the groimd, to pluck and roast it; 
another is, to hang it up on Shrove Tuesday, and eat it 
on Easter Sunday ; another, to keep it as long as an 
author, who has never flattered any body, has to wait 
for a literary pension. But this last period might be too 
long, even for pheasant. 

But the truth is, tastes differ in this respect, some 
going to the very verge of insanity. A brace of phea- 
sants sent as a present to France (the bird is all but 
worshiped by Gallic gourmands) were, on their arrival, 
condemned by the police as unfit for human food. They 
were in a state of putridity so forward, that it was con- 
sidered needless to bum or buiy them; they were 
merely thrown out on a public dunghill, in the belief 
that nobody, not even if starving, would ever dream of 
eating them. 



496 POULTBT Am) GAME. 

Next morning, £he pheasants Iiad disappeared ; and 
it was erentaally discovered that a wealthy epicare, who 
liad witnessed this casting out of culinary pearls, had 
waited and watched till the dead of night, and then^ 
unseen, had rescued the precious morsels, which, next 
day, were dressed and eaten, in private conunittee^ 
with ecstatic relish. 

The moment makes itself known to the pro&ne by 
the smell, and by a change of colour in the belly of the 
bird ; the initiated divine it by the same kind of instinct 
which enables a finished roaster to decide at a glance 
whether to take a fowl from the spit, or allow it to have 
one or two turns more. A great point is not to pluck 
your pheasant too soon. Accurate experiments have 
proved that birds kept in their feathers acquire a higher 
flavour than those which hang long in a state of nudity ; 
either because the contact of the air neutralises a portion 
of the aroma, or because a portion of the juices, destined 
to nourish the feathers, is reabsorbed, and enriches the 
flesh. In any case, decomposition must be allowed to 
commence before the day for cooking a pheasant is fixed. 
Then its foil flavour is developed, through the instru- 
mentality of an oily fat which requires a slight fermen- 
tation to attain its full ripeness ; exactly as the oil in 
coffee is made to give out its fragrance by the process of 
roasting. 

iNothing can be plainer than the English mode of 
dressing pheasants : roasting them, without any stuffing, 
before a quick fire, basting well, dishing them in their 
own gravy, with bread sauce as an accompaniment. We 



POULTKY AND GAME, 497 

have an idea, however, that the flesh of the bird is 
improved in juicmess by filling the crop only with veal 
staffing, containing a little more beef-suet than ordinary. 
If an old cock-pheasant must be roasted, let him hang in 
the larder till the last possible moment, and then stuff 
him throughout with rump-steak, fat and lean, chopped 
small. The beef, if left, will make capital potted meat 
afterwards. But the best way of disposing of old cock- 
pheasant is to Curry it, with not too large an allowance 
of curry-powder. It can thus be stewed down to any 
degree of tenderness, even to the flesh falling off the 
bones ; while the moderate amount of seasoning will 
bring out the game flavour without overpowering it. 

French cooks fill pheasants with a variety of stuffings, 
principally sausage-meat, truffles, mushrooms, roast 
chestnuts, and bacon ; they surround it with olives, and 
send up with it sauces seasoned with sundry zests, — as 
vequice, pepper and salt, lemon-juice, or Seville orange- 
juice. 

Brillat Savarin's receipt is famous, but expensive. 
In his time, however, woodcocks were much cheaper 
than they are now. Several towns in the north of 
France — as Abbeville and Montreuil-sur-Mer — were 
once celebrated for their snipe and woodcock pat^s ; but 
such things have become rarities. What between the 
drainage of land, and the rapid communication with 
England, the few birds that are still to be had speedily 
find their way to the best market.

them. Divide the proceeds into two lots, — one con-

sisting of the flesh, the other of the livers and en- 
trails. 

Take the flesh, and diop it into a forcemeat with 
beef-marrow that has been cooked by steaming, a little 
grated bacon, pepper, salt, sweet herbs, and a sufficient 
quantity of good truffles to fill the internal cavity of the 
pheasant Take care to secure this stuffing in such a 
way that it cannot escape ; which is sometimes difficult 
when the bird is " forward." Nevertheless, there are 
various means of succeeding: amongst others, by cutting 
a crust of bread to act as a plug, and fastening it in its 
position by a string. 

Take a slice of bread a couple of inches broader and 
longer every way than the pheasant laid upon it length- 
wise. Then take the livers and entrails of the wood- 
cocks, and pound them together with two large truffles, 
an anchovy, a little minced bacon, and a good lump of 
butter. Spread this paste equally over the slice of bread, 
and place it under the pheasant while roasting, so as to 
catch every drop of gravy that falls firom it When 
roasted, serve your pheasant gracefully reposing on its bed 
of toast, surround it with bitter oranges, and make your 
mind easy as to the result Its success is guaranteed 
by the very nature of things. Treated according to the 
preceding receipt, the pheasant, already a bird of dis- 
tinction in itself, is saturated externally by the car- 
bonised fat of the savoury bacon ; internally, it is im- 
pregnated with the odorous emanations escaping from 
the truffles and the woodcock-flesh. The toast, already 
so richly garnished, receives, besides, the triple com-

Bobespierre. That monstrous individual, combining, 
as often happens, cowardice with cruelty, and having 
to appear at one of his grand occasions on horseback, 
manifested such evident fear of his steed, as to excite 
ridicule and contempt in all his beholders. We are 
writing from memory, but think it was at the/^^« when 
he deigned to acknowledge the existence of a Supreme 
Being. The horse-riders of the day tickled the public 
fancy by an exhibition which every body understood. 
The thing became popular, crossed the Channel, and 
^* Billy Button's Ride" excited the mirth of spectators 
long after its sarcastic allusions were lost. But it put a 
stop to Robespierre's horsemanship; and, still more mar- 
vellous to tell, it does not appear that its authors were 
guillotined in consequence. 

There are several ways of making a Cliartreuse; the 
following is the simplest and easiest: Take an oval or 



500 POULTBT AND GAHE. 

oblong mould, large enough to hold a couple of partridges, 
and sufficient vegetables to cover and conceal them com- 
pletely. 

Boil carrots and turnips in broth; when cooked, 
take them out to drain. Boil Savoy or other hearted 
cabbage separately in water; when cooked, let them 
drain in a cullender, and squeeze, with a wooden spoon , 
all the moisture out of them. You may also have 
cooked any other good vegetable that is in season, — as 
green pease, kidney beans, small onions, &c. 

The partridges may be put into the Chartreuse whole ; 
but if cut in quarters, they will be more convenient to 
serve with a spoon, with as little demolition of the 
Chartreuse as possible. Stew the quartered partridges 
till tender in as little well-seasoned gravy as may be. 
This stewing allows partridges to be employed which 
are not young enough to make a first-rate roast 

You will now proceed to pack your Chartreuse. If 
you have once seen one served, you will have no difficulty 
in imitating it. Butter the inside of your mould ; at the 
bottom lay strips and slices of carrot and turnip cut 
into any shapes and lengths you fimcy ; but the broader 
and the longer they are, the better they will hold together. 
You will dispose them in some kind of pattern. Line 
the sides in the same way with sliced carrots and turnips. 
Then put in a lining of cabbage, pressing it down tightly, 
to make the Chartreuse easier to turn out of its mould. 
Then put the stewed and quartered partridges all together 
in the middle; over and about them lay your more 
delicate vegetables, — as pease, kidney beans, boiled let- 



POULTRY AND GAME. 501 

tnces (thoroughly drained and squeezed); then fill up 
every vacant cranny with cabbage^ packing it as tightly 
as you can. 

When finished^ put your mould into a hot-water 
bath, taking care that no water enters it Let it stew 
there for an hour, to heat thoroughly, and help the 
ingredients to combine. When wanted, clap a hot dish 
to the open top of the mould ; invert them by a rapid 
movement, so that the mould is standing on the dish ; 
give a few gentle taps with the handle of a knife, and the 
mould will come away, leaving the Chartreuse unbroken. 
Pour round it the heated-up and thickened gravy in 
which the partridges were stewed, and serve. 

This dish is really worth the trouble it gives. It 
may be varied by the addition of sausages or bacon to 
the ragodt of birds. If a hot- water bath is not available, 
the Charti*euse, once packed in its mould, may be heated 
up over hot ashes (with care not to bum), or in a sand- 
bath. It is the turning it out of the mould which requires 
the greatest precaution and dexterity. To effect this with 
more certainty, some cooks put an oval piece of paper at 
the bottom of the mould, and line its sides all round with 
one broad strip ; others make use of linen-cloth in the 
same way — ^which is better. This is done more especially 
when the vegetables and game are only three-parts 
cooked before putting them into the mould, and the 
cooking is finished oSiniL 

Carrots and turnips, boiled in soup to flavour it, will 
serve perfectly to make the walls of a Chartreuse. In 
winter, they may be agreeably varied with slices of 



502 POULTBT AKD GAME. 

parsnip and salsify. The npper and lower borders of 
the Chartreuse may be garnished with green pease, 
arranged like a string of beads, with kidney beans, or 
with caoliflower divided into small sprigs. 

Pigeons [&om Delamer's PigeoTis arid Batbits] , Qtuxils, 
and otiter darh-jleshed Birds^ have the reputation of being- 
a heating diet, which is probably correct. Bnt, how- 
ever that may be, one epicorean role holds good with 
pigeons, — ^which is, whatever receipts may be given ix> 
serve them hot, in all forms they are better eaten cold. 
There are, in fact, only two orthodox English ways of 
cooking pigeons, namely, in a baked pie, and in a boiled 
pie, or pigeon pudding (see p. 448). 

Baked Pigeon Pie. Pluck, singe, and draw the 
birds. Cut off the heads and necks, and put them asid& 
with the livers and gizzards. Boil these down for gra\y, 
with a piece of beef, adding pepper, salt, and mace. 

Some cooks put the pigeons whole into the pie-dish ; 
but they are more convenient to help at table if divided 
into quarters, by first splitting them lengthwise down 
the back and along the breastbone, and then cutting 
them across. 

Put a pie-cup inverted in the centre of the dish ta 
retain the gravy. At the bottom of the dish put a layer 
of lean beef-steak ; you may substitute veal for it, if 
preferred. On the steak lay the quartered pigeons, until 
the dish is fiiU. Have ready some hard-boiled eggs 
peeled from the shell ; halve them crosswise, and make- 
use of them to fill up any hollows that may be left 
between the pigeons, with the view of giving to the- 



POULTRY AND GAME. 50S 

crust as level an outside surface as possible. Pour in 
the gravy over aU. The feet and legs of the pigeons 
should have been cut off at the knee. 

When the crust is on the dish and the pie is finished 
makings stick a bunch of these feet and logs in the 
middle, to mark what sort of pie it is. This pie is 
intended to be eaten cold : as a rule in cookery, all meat- 
pies contaming hard-boUed eggs are meant not to be 
eaten hot. The pie-dish is here mentioned thus particu- 
larly, because it is not the general fashion to make 
Pigeon Pie with a standing crust, the bird being too 
small to bone without a deal of trouble. 

Pigeon Pat4 (French). Take six fine young pigeons ; 
singe and empty them. Take their livers, hearts, giz- 
zards, and lungs, and chop them very small (to make a 
forcemeat), together with a dozen shallots, one clove of 
garlic, parsley, thyme, pepper and salt, mixed spices, the 
eighth of a pound of beef-suet, and the same of lean veal 
(both chopped small). Add to these a raw egg, and a 
spoonful of brandy. Mix all together, and with it stuff 
the bodies of your pigeons. 

At the bottom of your earthen pat^-dish put a layer 
of slices of bacon sprinkled with shallots and sweet herbs 
chopped small ; then a layer of pigeons ; then thin- 
sliced bacon sprinkled with shallots, &c. ; and so on. 
Fill up the top with knuckle of veal cut into small 
pieces, to form the jelly ; throw in a tumbler of white 
wine, or wine-and-waterifthe wine i8 very strong. Lute 
the cover of the pat6-dish down with paste, and send it 
to the baker's to pass the night in his oven. 



501 POULTBT AND GAME. 

This preparation possesses many good qualities. It 
is economical, for there is nothing wasted; it is oon- 
venient, for it is always ready so long as it lasts ; and it 
is agreeable, for it furnishes a savoury cool repast in 
sultry weather. 

Booh Pie. On estates where there are rookeries, a 
proportion of the young birds are often killed off in 
spring. As they must be shot immediately they leave 
the nest, while still sitting perched on the branches 
around it, and before they have taken flight with their 
parents, they afford easy practice for juvenile gunners, 
and may be afterwards converted into an excellent pie. 

Skin the birds ; quarter them ; let them lie all night 
in salt-and-water ; and then treat them exactly as for 
Pigeon Pie. 

Boast Pigeons (French). Idem. The birds should 
be killed by having their necks broken, and should not 
be bled. When they are plucked, drawn, singed, and 
trussed, cover them with three or four thin slices of 
bacon, and as many vine-leaves, tied around them with 
a coarse thread. Boast them on a spit, and baste them 
with good veal broth and a slice of butter. If they arc 
young and tender, half an hour is long enough to cook 
them. If they are to be eaten hot, dish them up as they 
are, simply taking off the thread which confines the vine- 
leaves and the bacon, and serve them with a Scntee 
Piquante made by mixing a little mustard, salt, tarragon 
vinegar, and pepper with the gravy which comes from 
them. If the gravy is poor or short in quantity, add a 
little very good Florence oD. 



POULTRY AND GAME. 505^ 

If the Boast Pigeons are to be eaten cold, as advised, 
they will keep a better shape if the thread is not removed 
till they are quite cold, supposing it bo intended to 
let the bacon and vine-leaves remain upon them. .In 
this case, serve with a garnishing of watercresses, nas- 
turtium and borage flowers, and the heart-leaves of 
cabbage-lettuces. Let them be accompanied by a sauce- 
boat containing salad mixture. If the larding (as bacon 
so employed is called) and vine-leaves be removed, the 
pigeons must be glazed, or glacMj when they are half 
cold, with a glazing made by boiling down the remains 
of a ham, with a small knuckle of veal, or a piece of 
shin of beef. Garnish with slices of lemon and savoury 
jelly turned out of very small moulds. 

To carve roast pigeons, cut them in quarters, leaving 
the portion of breast attached to each wing or leg that is 
helped. 

Pigeons a la Crapaudine — Broiled Pigeons (French). 
Idem. Select young birds, which have the down still 
hanging to the tips of their feathers. Singe them 
as before; cut off the neck from the body, and split them 
open down the back. Flatten them as well as you can 
without breaking too many bones. Smear them with 
oil or butter, and sprinkle them with salt, pepper, and 
parsley and chives minced fine. Make this seasoning 
stick on in as great a quantity as possible. Cover them 
also with bread-crumbs or raspings, or with grated 
biscuit. Lay them on the gridiron, and grill them over 
a slow fire, which, of course, should be made with char- 
coal. When they are nicely browned and thoroughly 



506 POULTRY AND GAME. 

cooked, serve them with a sauce made of veijuioe or 
vinegar, salt, pepper, minced shallots, and a morsel of 
butter; or they may be served with the above-men- 
tioned Sauce Piquante. Young Rabbits may be cooked 
in the same way. 

Broiled pigeons, rabbits, and '^ such small deer," 
will come to table a better shape if they are flattened 
and held together with fine iron skewers, parboUed for 
ten minutes or a quarter of an hour in good veal broth, 
instead of water, suffered to cool, and the skewors 
then withdrawn. So prepared, they are convenient for 
innkeepers and others to have at hand, to put on the 
gridiron and serve at ten minutes' notice. The sauce 
for Broiled Pigeons most agreeable to English palates 
is Mushroom Sauce, ue. pickled mushroom buttons 
thrown into melted butter, with which a little ketchup, 
Heading Sauce, Soy, or other approved browning, has 
been previously mingled. 

Pigeons a la Tartare^ with Tartar Sauce. Broil them 
as before, and when they are of a light brown and well 
hot through, servo them on a hot dish, smrounded with 
Tartar sauce. 

Pigeons may be Roasted in a Stew-pan, like Leg of 
Lamb (p. 372). 

Pigeons and Green Pease. Put them into a stew-pan, 
with a good lump of butter and some white bacon cut 
into dice. Give them a toss or two over the fire, and 
then let them have a dusting of flour. Make them take 
a good colour; then add a quart of young green pease, 
a bunch of sweet herbs, and a sprig of mint. Moisten 



P0T7LTRT AND GAME. 507 

with a little broth, cook till thej are done enough over 
a slow fire, and serve snrroonded with all the pease and 
only a small quantity of the gravy. 

Instead of pease, you may employ the tender green 
stalks of yonng ron-up asparagus-plants chopped ta 
about the size of pease. 

Stuffed JPiffeona, Select fine and full-grown pigeons 
of the current year. Pluck and singe them, and empty 
them by a small opening made in the side, in order to- 
fill them better with stuffing. 

Make a light forcemeat with any remains of cold 
fowl, veal sweetbread, truffles or mushrooms, and a little- 
minced bacon, seasoned with pepper and salt, and bound 
together by beat-up egg. Brown them with butter in a 
stew-pan for a quarter of an hour, add a ladleful of stock, 
cover them closely with the lid of the stew-pan, and 
stew slowly until they are enough. 

Pigeaiis en PapUlotea — in Curl-papera. Cook them 
slowly in a stew-pan, with chopped bacon, butter, salt,, 
pepper, and nutmeg. When they are half-done, add small 
herbs, mushrooms, and a minced shallot. Care must b& 
taken not to overdo them. When they are cold, cut them 
in halves down the back and breast, cover them with their 
seasoning, and wrap them in oiled or buttered writing- 
paper. Grill them over a slow fire for twenty minutes. 

Woodcock and Snipe. These birds, as cooked in the^ 
usual way, tovthout drawing the intestines, are regarded 
by different persons with very different eyes, according 
to the state of their stomachs or their prejudices. By 
some, the Woodcock is regarded as the Queen of the 



508 POULTBT Am) GAMS. 

Marsh, and one of the most distinguished roasts which 
it is possible to offer to persons of the highest consi- 
deration. No culinary tribute of respect (except the 
pheasant) can rival the estimation in which the Wood- 
cock is held. This precious bird is so venerated bj 
epicures, that thej render it the same honours as are 
paid to the Grand Lama. Not only are its dejections, 
or trail, carefully caught on buttered toast moistened 
with lemon-juice, but they are afterwards eaten in solemn 
silence by fervent and admiring amateurs. 

Others, regarding Snipe and Woodcock with disgust, 
repudiate them altogether ; for few persons would have 
the courage to request their cook to empiy the birds 
before roasting them, and fewer cooks would dare to 
obey the order, if critical guests were expected to be 
present 

It is just possible that the one set of persons do not 
get so much as they fancy they do, and that the others 
need not be so very much a&aid of swallowing what they 
naturally regard with aversion. Woodcock and snipe, it 
appears, when wounded, relieve both their stomach and 
their bowel of any thing that might prove offensive. 

Mr. Ejiox, in his Game Birds and Wild Fotclj sug- 
gests another reason for the bird's being a more cleanly 
morsel to eat than is generally supposed. ^^I suc- 
ceeded in rearing a young woodcock," he tells us, " by 
feeding him plentiftilly with earth-worms — the species 
called brandlings, which abound in old heaps of compost, 
were the best These, when mixed with wet mould, he 
devoured greedily; and I found no small difficulty in 



POULTBY AND GAME. 509 

fomlsliing him with a sufficient quantify, while I varied 
his diet occasionallj with gentles, tadpoles, and the 
larvas of aquatic insects. 

^^ He became quite tame and reconciled to his place 
of captivity, which was an outhouse, the door of which 
had been removed and replaced by a fragment of an old 
fishing-net Like all pets, however, he met with an 
tmtimely fate. One afternoon, an inquisitive spaniel 
managed to creep under the net, and although a speedy 
rescue was attempted, it was too late; his career was 
ended. Being in excellent condition, he was handed 
over to the cook, and a better bird never appeared upon 
a table. So rapid tuas his digestion^ that the stomach was 
perfectly empty ; and the other viscera, or ^ trail,' con- 
tained only the peculiar cream-like matter usually found 
in the woodcock, while its flavour was positively irre- 
proachable, although he had breakfasted that very 
morning on nearly half a flower-potful of worms."

VEGETABLES. 

Once npon a time there lived and flourished people so 
ignorant of the constitution of the human frame as to 
hold it to be " vulgar" to eat vegetables. They might 
almost as well have held it to be vulgar to eat at aU. 
Beau Brummel, asked whether he had never eaten any 
vegetable, replied, with a sneer, that he believed he once 
ate — a pea. The consequence was, that fresh vegetables 
were but scantily supplied on fashionable or would-be 
fashionable tables; and we may be certain that the 
health of that generation suffered by the spread of 
scorbutic disease, and the prevalence of many ill-defined 
<somplaints. 

Since that time, common sense and dietetic science 
have made considerable strides in advance. Nobody 
now, in well-educated society, would venture to plead 
guilty to having " once ate a pea." On the contrary, 
plants in general are recognised as the basis and support 
of animal life. Philosophers have exercised their in- 
tellects in discussing which, if any, of the planets and 
their satellites are inhabited by sentient and intelligent 
creatures. Our cnriosity would be satisfied could we 
only ascertain which of those worlds possessed a world 
of vegetables ; the rest would follow. Without plants, 



VEGETABLES. 511 

the existence of animal life is scarcely conceivable : with 
them — with the sustenance and shelter which they offer 
in unlimited profusion — ^^'e may fairly assume that the 
Benevolent Being who created them would also create 
higher organisms to profit by the supplies they fiimish. 

Plants are the agents which achieve the first difficult 
step of converting inorganic into organic material. 
The moss and the lichen on the naked rock squeeze 
carbon from the atmosphere; which carbon becomes 
in time a bed of vegetable mould. Larger and more 
luxuriant plants succeed, without exterminating, their 
humble predecessors. Then come insects and herb- 
bating animals, to check the plants' luxuriance; and 
then come the insectivorous bird and the flesh-eating 
animal, to thin the swarms of caterpillars and the troops 
of grazers and browsers. 

In the sea, also, exactly the same sequence of pro- 
<luction and consumption occurs. First, we have sea- 
plants — not one of which is poisonous, while many 
are nutritious and medicinal ; then, the mollusk feeding 
on the sea-plant, and fed on by fishes with teeth and 
{stomachs adapted to their diet ; finally, the innumer- 
^ble feeders, great and smaU, who live by preying on one 
another. 

Oysters, mussels, cockles, and other shell-fish which 
live, according to the popular expression, by " suction'' 
— ^by microscopic particles brought to them by watery 
ourrents caused by the vibration of their cilia — are not 
a whit less than their greedier neighbours the dependents 
and the offspring of the vegetable world. Although 



512 VEGETABLES. 

iheir flesh secretes from the waters inorganic matters to 
form their shell, the food thej take in (however minute) 
to increase their jleBhy growth is entirely organic 
Their diet consists either of minute vegetable particles, 
or of infusorial animalcules that have fed on vegetables. 
The human race tops the ladder of organic life very- 
much in the style of " The House that Jack Built." 
For, this is the Sportsman that shot the Buck, that 
swallowed the Snail, that gnawed the Cabbage, that grew 
as a Plant in garden-ground. And this is the Lady 
that picked the Lobster, that killed the Codling, that 
devoured the Star-fish, that crushed the Whelk, that 
bored the Periwinkle, that nibbled the Pucus, that grew 
as a Plant in the bed of the Sea. All flesh is grass, and 
all fish too. How, then, can we do without vegetables? 

The extreme importance of vegetables or fruits 
entering in large proportion into our daily rations is 
less strongly forced upon our observation, in consequence 
of the profusion and constancy with which they are 
supplied to us. Our summers, happily, are rarely so 
hot and dry as to cause "greens" to fail; while our 
winters are seldom so severe as to destroy and reduce 
them to a pulp by frost Covent-Garden Market is 
never empty at six o'clock of a week-day morning, and 
the greengrocer has always something to show, more or 
less fresh and attractive to the eye. 

Many people fancy that the principal value of potatoes, 
cabbages, carrots, turnips, and other vegetables ftimished 
by the kitchen-garden and the field, consists in their 
eheapnessy in their supplying a large quantity of food at 



VEGETABLES. 513 

a low rate of cost, in their filling the stomachs of 
families without drawing too deeply on the family 
treasury. They would treat themselves and their 
households to more meat, they think, and eat fewer 
potatoes and other filling-up stuff, were not the former 
so dear in price. They would do this rather to gratify 
their palates, than out of considerations respecting health 
and strength. They are aware that meat is strengthen* 
ing, hut they forget the wholesome influence of vege- 
tables. By " vegetables," of course, is meant here the 
firesh produce of the kitchen-garden ; although all dry 
grain, com, flour, riee, maize, and the like, equally 
belong to the vegetable kingdom. They also have their 
beneficial eflects on health, but in a different manner 
and degree to those of kitchen vegetables. 

To realise fully the medicinal influence of a diet in 
which fresh vegetables supply their share, we have only 
to read the accounts of navigators, especially of Captain 
Cook and his predecessors. They made the discovery 
that fresh vegetables are a specific against that terrible 
disease, the scurvy, of which Willis says, " It is not any 
particular disease, but a legion of diseases." Enough 
meat is not enough ; it must be qualified by vegetables : 
whereas men can continue to live on vegetables alone 
in health, if not in the fulness of their possible strength. 
Not long since, a short-sighted old lady, who refused to 
touch fruit or vegetables for fear of cholera, actually died 
of scurvy in consequence of her mistaken prejudice. 
And such a small quantify of vegetable sufiSces to 
manifest its medicinal virtue! Sir Edward Parry, 

LL 



514 YIOSTABLES. 

while exploring that most fearful of cutrde^mesj the 
North- West Passage, restored several of his invalid 
sailors to health by cultivating for their use, on the fines 
of his cabin, mustard-and-cress, '^ sallets good for the 
scorbnte/' 

The mysteiy which formerlj hnng abont the natoxe 
of scurvy was the great impediment to its cure and the 
cause of its spread. Charleton observes, that it arises 
^^ chiefly from sharp, saline Particles taken in by In- 
spiration, from salt and corrupted Meats eaten, from 
bad Waters drank, from Nastiness, deep Chagrins, &c. 
Which Sentiment is confirmed by a daily Experi- 
ence; since Sailors, when at Sea, who breathe con- 
tinually a salt Air, eat salt and corrupted Meats, drink 
bad Waters, and do not keep themselves, then, extremely 
dean, are more subject to it than others.'' It does not 
occur to him that sailors on board ship scarcely breathe 
a Salter air, or are less cleanly in their habits, than 
many of the inhabitants of sea-port towns ; but that 
during a long voyage they are deprived of vegetables, 
which the latter have daily at their conunand. 

Nevertheless, the old practitioners were aware that 
^^ a very exact Diet is of more Effect than the best 
Medicines ; without this, it becomes incurable. Bleed- 
ing does not av£ul; strong Purgatives are hurtfrd." 
For the particular symptoms of the disease-— and the list 
is sad — ^particular medicines adapted thereto were to be 
used ; only miannff antiscorbuiies with them alL And the 
principal simple antiscorbutics were, horse-radish, sorrel^ 
butter-bur, scorzonera, sow-thistle, zedoaxy, polypody. 



YEOETABLES. 515 

elecampane, guaiacnm, sassafras, mnstard-seed, water- 
cress, water-trefoil, oranges, lemons, and juniper- 
berries — all fruits, vegetables, or roots. 

People on land are as liable as people at sea to 
flcurvy, when confined to a dry and salt meat diet, with 
a scant of vegetables. In the Memoirs of the French 
Academy, M. Poupart gives a minute account of scurvy 
which raged in Paris in the year 1699. Its symptoms 
;and consequences were extraordinary ; yet it was a true 
scurvy, and the persons attacked by it had all the usual 
scorbutic symptoms. 

A striking instance of the magic influence of 
fresh vegetable food in preserving health is given in 
Dr. Hooker's most interesting lecture on Insular I^oi'^s :* 

^^ Kerguelen's Land, the Isle of Desolation of Cook, 
is situated in the tempestuous South Indian Ocean, in 
the south latitude, corresponding to the latitude of 
Cornwall north, and within the northern limit of float- 
ing icebergs. It rears itself from the ocean as a black 
volcanic mass, girt with sea-clifis, and perennially 
swept by terrific storms. At a few miles' distance it 
appears to be absolutely sterile, and on nearing the 
•coast the scenery scarcely improves. A narrow belt of 
grass skirts the deep harbours, and above this are brown, 
rounded heaps of a very peculiar Umbelliferous plant 
{Azorella Selago)^ growing like tufts of a gigantic moss 
or saxifirage. These are succeeded by scattered tufts of 
^ass and herbs struggling for existence in a most barren 
soil. 

* See the Nos. of the Oardenen* Chroniek for Jamuury 1867.

« Of the flowering plants, aU are perennial, and one 
of them had a yerj remarkable appearance. It was a 
gigantic Cmciferons plant, allied to the northern Scurvy- 
Grass {Coehlearia)y and which we christened the K^:- 
goelen's-Land Cabbage, both because of its appearance, 
and because we used it daily as a pot-herb. During 
one hundred and thirty days we ate no other firesh 
vegetable than this, which was served with the ship's 
salt junk and pork ; and during that time there was nat 
a case of illness of any consequence in a company of one 
hundred and twenty officers and men. It hence well 
merits its Latin name of PringUa antiscorinUicay the 
generic name being given in compliment to Sir John 
Pringle, an eminent writer on that scourge of seamen, 
the scurvy* 

*^ This plant was abundant near the sea, and is a 
well-marked feature in the view of Christmas Harbour 
which is engraved in Captain Cook's Third VoyagOb It 
is allied to no other known plant in the southern 
hemisphere, and is as remarkable, whether for its 
curious habit of growth, or its botanical characters, 
as any of those singular plants which I have indicated 
as forming peculiar features in the sea-cliffs of the 
Madeiran, Azorean, or Canarian Islands. Like these, 
too, it tells no tale as to the origin or affinities of the 
Kerguelen's-Land Flora." 

The importance (under those peculiar circumstances) 
of a single cruciferous plant could be hardly brought 
into higher relief; and it will be remembered that many 
of our most useful kitchen vegetables belong to the 



VEGETABLES. 517 

Cmoiferous Family, so called because their flowers 
have four petals disposed opposite to each other in the 
form of a cross. 

The plants cultivated in European kitchen-gardens 
belong to a comparatively small number of Natural 
Families — ^so few, indeed, that they are speedily padsed 
in review. 

1. The above-named Crucifers include cabbages, 
cauliflowers, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, Scotch kale and 
sprouting kale, couve tronchuda or Portugal cabbage, 
sea-kale, kohl-rabi or turnip-rooted cabbage, turnips, 
radishes, garden-cress, mustard, horse-radish, water- 
cress. 

2. The Umbellifers (from the Latin for an umbrella, 
also for a head of fennel) contribute carrots, parsnips, 
skirrets, celery, parsley, chervil, fennel, angelica, cara- 
way, coriander, and the true samphire.* 

* We are all acquainted with one that gathers samphire ''half- 
way down the face" of Dover cliff; bat how manj of our readers 
know the taste of the produce of that "dreadful trade"? The 
samphire business nowadays must be a small concern. One or two 
species of glass-wort» which grow on mud-banks washed by the sea, are 
sold and pickled by the style and title of samphire, but are as false a 
substitute for the real thing as was the fair maid of the ballad who 
listed « under the name of Richard Carr." The pickled Sallcomias 
taste of nothing but the vinegar and the spices, and altogether differ 
from that classic Umbellifer, the Crithmum maritimum, which requires 
chM for its soil as well as saline vapour for its atmosphere. 

John Evelyn, whose Kalendarium Hortense marks quite an epoch in 
our Oarden Literature, had a high opinion of the merits of " sampler," 
as he calls it. ** Not only pickled, but crude and cold, when young 
and tender (and such as we may cultivate and have in our kitchen, 
gardens almost the year round), it is, in my opinion, for its aromatic 
and other excellent vertues and effects against the spleen, cleansing 
the passages, shaip'ning appetite, &c., so far preferable to most of our

summer is wanner and longer than that of England. 

7. Unless we include the ice-plant (for garnishing-

better and more kindly with me than what comes from our own coasts.

melons, and the immense varieiy of gourds and pump-

Europe than with us, being employed principally for 
pickling young as gherkins ; the others render consider- 
able service to the inhabitants of the warmer latitudes of 
the Continent. 

10. From the unpromising Docks, the PolygonesB,

of sorrel. 

11. The Chenopods, or Goosefoots, give us beetroot,

12. To the same purpose are applied the leaves of 
purslane, which gives its name to a Family, the Portu- 
lacese. It is likewise eaten young in salad. 

18. The Borages contribute blue and white flowers 
for garnishing the same. 

14. The TropsBolums also give, through the garden

allj be fonnd in old-established gardens. 

17. Finally, the cnltiyated nrashroom represents not 
merely a Family, bat a grand Natural Division of the 
Vegetable Kingdom. 

It thus appears that, in the British Isles, cnltiyated 
kitchen-garden vegetables are derived from no more 
than seventeen Natural Families of plants, which, by 
careful searching out, might be extended a litUe beyond 
a score. 

Most vegetables (with a few exceptions, such as green 
pease, when shelled by fingers known to be dean) should 
be thrown into cold water immediately after trimming, 
paring, scraping, or other necessary preparation,, and 
allowed to remain there some time previous to cooking. 
If fresh, this prevents the evaporation of their natural 
juices (and in some, as the Jerusalem artichoke, their 
discoloration) by the contact of the air. If slightly faded, 
or the weather be hot, it freshens them up. Flaccid 
vegetables, that have become limp and drooping, never 
cook so well in that state. 

The Cabbage-tribe renders immense service in the 
kitchen, and even in a first-rate kitchen. A skilfril 
artist finds in these plants great resources for varying his 
soups, rago{its, garnishes, and frameworks. A boiled 
rump of beef (or even an adult partridge stewed) takes 
it as a compliment to be flanked by a stout wall of 
cabbage. All depends on the treatment and seasoning. 
It is exactly thus that the pen of the poet ennobles the 
most commonplace expressions. 



VEGETABLES, 521 

Cabbage^ Plam-^boUed ; either Savoys or hearted 
summer -cabbage. If the cabbages are large, cut 
diem across at the bottom twice, without dividing 
them, to allow the water to enter them. Throw them 
into boiling soft water with salt in it, and let them 
gallop without the lid on. The time they take to cook 
will depend entirely on their age and the solidness of 
their hearts. When quite tender, take them up and let 
them drain in a cullender, pressing out the water gently 
with a spoon. Cabbage sent to table dripping is one of 
the rudest specimens of cookery. After draining in the 
cullender, transfer them to your hot vegetable-dish. 
Apply a small hot plate to the top ; squeeze the cabbage 
firmly with this, holding the dish sideways to let all the 
water run out. When no more drops from it, set your 
dish on the dresser ; remove the plate ; with a knife cut 
the flattened cabbage into squares, for the convenience 
of helping ; and serve. 

Brussels Sprouts. Boil as above, but drain vseU^ 
without squeezing. They may be accompanied by plain 
melted butter, Dutch Sauce, or Matrimony Sauce. In 
Belgium, the small cabbages or sprouts are not esteemed 
if of more than half an inch in diameter ; but this, we 
hold, is being over-particular. Brussels sprouts are 
most useftil as winter greens. At Brussels they are 
sometimes served with a sauce composed of vinegar, 
butter, and nutmeg, poured over them hot after they 
have been boiled. The top, says Van Mens, in a paper 
in the Horticultural Transactions^ is very delicate when 
dressed, and quite different in flavour from the sprouts. 



522 VEGETABLES. 

It is usual there to cat off the top ten or fifteen days 
before gathering firom the stem. 

CauliflowerB, Plain. Some cooks serre cauliflowers 
whole ; this has two disadvantages : First^ thej are 
tempted to send them to table underdone, even so hard 
as to resist the spoon, for the sake of retaining their 
shapely appearance.* Secondly, it prevents their dis- 
lodging caterpiUars or small snails, which will often enter 
them towards the dose of summer. It is better to cut 
them up into respectably sized sprigs ; they will thus be 
both equally and cleanlily boiled. Take up with a 
skimmer, drain well, and pile in the dish, which (if the 
cauliflowers are to be served without sauce) may have a 
false bottom or strainer. 

Plain melted butter or Dutch sauce may either 
accompany them or be poured over them. 

Broccoli^ although cooked and served in the same 
way as cauliflowers, must not be confounded with thenu 
They resemble each other greatly, especially when only 
the head, or flower, is seen. The leaves of broccoli are of 
a deeper green, and the heads of a less pure white^ 
than those of cauliflowers ; but. the grand difference is^ 
that cauliflowers are tender — ^injured, and even destroyed^ 
by slight jBrosts, while broccoli bear our ordinary (though 
not our severe) winters. Consequently, cauliflowers 
come to hand in summer and autumn, while broccoli 

* " Vegetables when not sufficiently cooked are known to be so 
exceedingly unwholesome and indigestiblei that the custom of serring

ftimish an earlj winter, spring, and early summer 
supply. It must be admitted that the cauliflower is 
even a more delicate vegetable than th^ broccoli. 

There are white, green, and purple broccoli ; the two 
last being always much smaller, and also agreeing in 
both hoiling green. Both are amongst the most delicious 
of vegetables. In Darwin's Phytologtay we read : 

" Oft in each month, poetic Tighe I be thine 
To dish green broccoli with savoury chine ; 
Oft down thj tuneful throat be thine to cram 
The snow-white cauliflower with fowl and ham !" 

The learned Doctor (grandfather of the author of 
the Origin of Species) shows his taste in lauding green 
broccoli, undervalued as they are by cooks because tliey 
do not dish so prettily as the white. 

Cauliflower y Bakedy Ju Boil as above. When drained 
and piled on the dish, pour over them a small quantity 
of melted butter, good of the butter ; grate over them 
any cheese you like (Parmesan is the real thing), and 
set them for a few minutes in a brisk oven, or, better, 
under a salamander. 

Cauliflou>er, Baked, B (German). Boil the cauli- 
flowers, whole, in the usual way, until nearly done 
enough. Drain well, and arrange them as dose together 
as possible on a dish that wiU stand the fire. Pour over 
ihem a thick sauce made of good broth, butter, flour, 
and nutmeg, with egg-yolks stirred up smoothly in it. 
Dust over all some grated Parmesan cheese, and bake 
half an hour in a not too fierce oven. 

On serving, the rim of the dish (well wiped) may 



524 TEGETABLSS. 

be garnished with slices of smoked tongue or firied 
sausages. 

Cauliflower^ Fried. When the sprigs of cauliflower 
are boiled nearly enough, drain ihem well, dip in batter, 
and fiy to a light brown in a deep pan, with plenty of 
hot fat 

Tufts of cauliflower, fried in this waj, make an 
elegant border round sundry small dishes. 

Cabbage and Satisages. When the cabbage is cooked, 
drained, and squeezed, lay it on a trencher or broad flat 
dish ; chop it small and evenly, so that no lumps or bits 
bigger than others are left in it Return it to a stew- 
pan, and heat it up again with a bit of butter and a little 
pepper and salt, without letting it fry or get brown in 
the least When nicely hot through, spread it in the 
middle of your dish, levelling the top with the back of a 
spoon, and on it arrange your sausages, which may be 
either boiled or fried ; or you may put poached eggs in 
the middle of your bed of chopped cabbage, and surround 
them with a ring of sausages. 

Tumip'Topa may be treated either like cabbage, 
plain-boiled and squeezed, or chopped and heated up 
again as before. Some cooks change the water in which 
they are boiled, to moderate the strength of their flavour. 
It is better to boil them in a large quantity of salt-and- 
water, so as to retain their principles, though in a less 
concentrated form; because they are often eaten as 
much to purify the blood as for variety's sake. There 
is an old notion that turnips generally are good for 
affections of the chest Lord Chesterfield, the author 



VEGETABLES. 525 

of the famous Letters, recommended their use to his 
son. 

The season of turnip-tops is verj short, and they 
must be taken in time, before thej get sticky ; but they 
are useful during the few days they are in their prime, 
since they come at a time when other greens are 
scarce. 

Turnip-tops, minced, are rendered more delicate by 
mixing them with other greens of less decided flavour. 
Thus they are excellent, half turnip-tops and half any 
sort of cabbage or sprouts ; or they may be combined in 
the same proportion with spinach, the patience-dock 
(which is at its best at the same time of year), or sorrel. 
The latter mixture especially makes a very agreeable 
dish of vegetable. 

Red Cahboffej Stewed, Shred the cabbage as if for 
pickling ; wash and pick it carefully, to be sure that no 
worms or insects have insinuated themselves between the 
leaves. Boil it tender in salt-and-water ; strain it well, 
chop it fine, and return it to the stew-pan with enough 
good stock to keep it firom burning, pepper, salt, and a 
pinch of allspice. It will then be of a dull purple colour. 
When it has had a good boil up, and has become quite 
mellow, stir up with it thoroughly a slight dash of 
vinegar, which will change its colour to the bright red 
of pickled cabbage. 

Stewed red cabbage is eaten with sausages, boiled 
salt pork, corned or hung beef, grilled ham, &c. It 
is also a favourite dish for meager days, and may 
accompany poached or fiied eggs, salt fish, &c. ; in 



^26 VXaSTABLBS. 

which case, batter or meager broth must be substituted 
for the stock to heat it up iu after chopping. 

Savoy CaibbageBy Stewed m Cream (Gterman). The 
Savoys may be boiled in water with a little salt in it 
until done enough. Let them cool, and gently squeeze 
the water out Cut them in quarters, take out tiie 
thick stalks ; stew the cabbages thoroughly, covered 
closely, over a slow fire, with a good piece of washed-out 
butter, a little flour and mace, and enough cream to 
keep them firom burning. 

Hot Slaw (American). Cut cabbage in fine shreds, 
boil in clear water until perfectly tender, allowing so 
little that, when it is cooked sufficiently, there will be 
scarcely (almost?) none left in the spider (stew-pan). 
Just before dishing, add to a common-sized spiderftd a 
teacup of sharp vinegar, a piece of butter half the size 
of a common hen's egg [what is the size of an uncommon 
hen's egg ?] , a little salt, and a dust of pepper ; the latter 
oan be added at the table if desired. Many persons dis- 
like pepper ; therefore as little as will answer had better 
generally be used in all cookery. Dish in extra plates 
at the table. 

Cold Slaw. Cut the cabbage (cold cooked?) very 
fine; dissolve in a cup of vinegar a teaspoonftd of 
sugar, the same of salt; add a little pepper; pour it 
over the cabbage, and add another half-cup of vine* 

gar. 

Broccoli (Idem). Soak an hour in salt water, then 
boil in a little water till half done ; aftar which, add 
as much milk as water, and finish cooking; cut it up.

and season with butter^ salt, and pepper ; or serve whole 
with vinegar. 

Stuffed Cabbages (German). Take three or four heads 
of cabbage, according to the size of your dish, and 
acoop oat part of their insides at the place of the stalk. 
Chop up a portion of what is extracted very fine, 
together with an onion and a good piece of bacon ; add 
to this, and mix well, six fresh eggs, the grated cromb 
of two rolls, a little mace, a good bit of batter, and a 
few spoonfuls of fresh cream. Fill your hollowed-out 
cabbages with this sta£Sng, cover the hole in each with 
a cabbage-leaf, and tie all tight with tape or twine 
crosswise. Lay them in a saucepan closely side by 
aide, cover them well with good broth, and boil until 
"thoroughly done. 

When ready to serve, take out each cabbage care- 
inlly with a skimming-ladle, lay it in the dish, remove 
the tape, and pour over all either onion sauce or white 
usance made with cream. 

This, with the preceding and the following, are 
national dishes often alluded to in descriptions of 
German every-day life. Take, for example, one trait 
from a sketch of a (German professor : ^^ He is a curious 
being. He lives in a poky flat ; his wife does the cook- 
ing and washing; he is absurd enough to like cabbage 
dressed after the fashion of his country ^ instead of eating, 
like a Briton, the simple vegetable as Nature made it, 
and with the water in which it was boiled nicely pre- 
served in its dripping leaves.''— >Stitun2ay Betsiew^

Sauerkohly Sauerhravt^ or Sourkrouty to make (Grerman). 
Shred fine, hard, white-hearted cabbages, as if for salad. 
To preserve or pickle them, strew over and amongst them 
a good hand All of salt and a spoonful of cream of tartar, 
putting first a little water to them ; you may also mix in 
a few carraway seeds. Then cover the shred cabbage 
with whole leaves ; close the top of the vessel with a 
well-fitting wooden cover, lay a stone on the top, and 
put the vessel in a warm place, where its contents ivill 
turn sour. At the end of a week or so it will be ready 
for use. Cook it in a well-dosed stone or earthen 
vessel, with butter, broth, and, when required, a dash 
of vinegar. Some also like the addition of a large 
spoonful of capers when the cabbage is nearly done 
enough. 

Sauerkohly with Borsdotf Apples* (German). Shred 
white, well-hearted cabbages in the above-mentioned 
way ; peel half the quantiiy (in bulk) of apples, cut them 
in slices ; take also a few slices of cooked ham ; besmear 
the inside of a saucepan with butter ; put at the bottom 
a piece of veal leaf-fat with a bit of butter on it, then 
a layer of shred cabbage, then a few slices of lemon, 
a bit of butter, some pounded mace and pepper, a little 
vinegar, then apple and ham, and again cabbage and 
butter, continually in layers one over the other, until 
the stew-pan is full. Cover the whole with a leaf of

Sea-kale is a truly British dish. M. Yilmorin, in 
the Bon Jardinier^ bqjs of it : ^^ Excellent vegetable^ 
indigenous, largely cultivated in England, and deserving 
equal attention in France. It is a plant nearly related 
to the Cabbages, but whose perennial root produces 
every year firesh leaves and shoots. These annual shoots, 
blanched Gcom the outset of their development by a 
process which we are about to indicate, constitute its 
produce." 

Some of our garden vegetables are of high antiquity ; 
asparagus was a favourite vegetable with Cato, and 
onions are inscrutable. Others are quite modem up« 
starts ; one of which is sea-kale. On many parts of 
the south coast, the inhabitants, firom time immemorial, 
have been in the habit of searching for it in spring in 



.TKGETABLES. 533 

spots where it grows spontaneously, and cutting off the 
young and tender leaves and stalks, as yet unexpanded, 
and in a blanched state, dose to the crown of the root. 
Evelyn, confounding it with " the broccoli from Naples, 
perhaps the lialmerida of Pliny [or Athenasus rather], 
capUaia marina etfloriiay^ mentions that ^^ our sea-keele, 
the ancient crambe^ and growing on our coast, are very 
delicate." But its cultivation is quite a recent practice. 

Mr. Curtis, in his ^^ Directions for Cultivating the 
Crambe maritima, or Sea-kale" (1799), tells us : " Mr. 
William Jones, of Chelsea, saw bundles of it, in a culti- 
vated state, exposed for sale in Chichester market, in 
the year 1753. I learn from different persons that 
attempts have been made at various times to. introduce 
it to the London markets, hut meff^ectuaUy. A few 
years since, I renewed the attempt myself, and, though 
it was not attended vrith all the mcceaa I could have unshedy 
I flatter myself it has been the means of making the 
plant so generally known, that in friture the markets 
of the first ciiy in the world will be duly supplied with 
this most desirable article." 

Taste and fashion have greatly changed since then. 
The faint acceptance has altered to a brisk demand. 
At present, the quantity of sea-kale annually sold 
amounts to a very considerable sum; for when good, 
it is never cheap. Low-priced sea-kale, as a rule, is 
either imperfectly blanched or run up o' legs ; in which 
case, it is hardly worth the cooking. 

Sea-kale^ Boiled White* From the time of cutting 
to cooking, keep it in a dark place ; a close, damp 



534 VEGETABLES. 

cellar is perfecdj suitable. The action of light gra- 
doallj greens it^ spoiling both its appearance and 
.flavour. This change for the worse may be observed 
,in sea-kale which has been exposed in open shops for 
.several successive days. 

Wash it well, to clear out any earth or sand that 
may have fidlen between the tips of each shoot ; cut out 
decayed or worm-eaten spots; tie it in small bundles 
of two or three shoots each, for the convenience of 
taking up; and let it lie, covered with a board or lid, 
in a pail of cold water till cooking time comes. Then 
throw the little bundles of kale into a saucepan with 
plenty of boiling water, in which a little salt has been 
dissolved. 

It is as well to repeat that Sir Humphrey Davy 
explains that the reason why vegetables and fish should 
be cooked by plunging them in hoUing salt-and-water is, 
that this solution boils at a higher temperature than 
plain water, and that the sudden scalding fixes the 
albumine, mucilage, and other nutritive parts of the 
viand, instead of their being macerated and sodden, 
and so partly lost, in lukewarm water. 

Keep the water boiling galloping. In twenty 
minutes or a little more, according to its age and firesh- 
ness, the sea-kale will be done enough, which may be 
known by trying it with a fork. Take care to let it 
be done enough. The usual mode of serving is to pile 
it, like asparagus, on sippets of toasted bread previously 
dipped in the kale-boilings (if the kale is perfectly 
blanched, and the water consequently remains dear 



VB6STABLES. 535 

and colourless; otherwise, not), and to ponr over it 
some white sauoe, or melted batter made with milk 
instead of water. 

If allowed to get a little too forward, or if light has 
been admitted to it before cuttiDg, sea-kale is apt to 
contract a slight bitterness, — ^which, however, is not 
disagreeable to every taste. For those who dislike it, 
it may be considerably diminished, if not entirely re- 
medied, by transferring the kale, when half-cooked, 
£rom one saucepan of boiling salt-and-water to ano- 
ther. 

Sea^hale^ Boiled Browuy or Stewed. Boil it as before

it till quite tender in as little good stock as will cover 
it, to which you may add any roast-beef, roast-veal, or 
other good brown gravy you may have at hand. Add 
also a little browning, or a bit of burnt onion. When 
done, arrange the sea-kale on slices of toast. If the 
gravy is still thin, reduce it by boiling a few minutes 
longer, or thicken with a dust of flour or arrowroot ; 
season to taste with pepper and salt, give a final boil, 
and pour it hot over the sea-kale.

water an hour or two, and then boil (about half an hour)

pour over it a thick white sauce, rich with cream or

Stewed Celery^ Brounu Proceed exactly as with

Fried Celery. Boil it till half-cooked or a little 
more ; take it out, and let it drain well on a napkin. 
Dip it in batter, and firy to a Ught brown. This dish, 
if well done, is excellent ; but it is useless to attempt it 
without a deep frying-pan, and plenty of oil or fat to 
plunge it into. 

Celery has the reputation of being stimulant in its 
nature ; still, delicate stomachs find a difficulty in 
digesting it raw. But although it loses a portion of its 
medicinal properties by cooking, epicures think it wise 
not to forget that it is an aromatic, heating, stomachic, 
tonic vegetable, and has consequently a tendency to 
produce excitement. The Almanack dee Gourmands 
relieves its conscience by warning timorous young 
gentlemen of its stimulant qualities, in order that they 
may abstain from it, and not be led into making rash 
ofiers of marriage. For the same reason, it is not the 
salad to recommend to old bachelors who wish to re- 
main so. 

Ude agrees with this, in opining that Celery is a 
very heating, but easily digested, vegetable ; it will be 
found, however, of great use in cookery, as it is to be

seen in so many preparations, — soups, salads, sauces, 
and entremets of all descriptions. 

Artichokes (which enjoy a wide-spread medicinal and 
anti-rheumatic reputation) are commonly eaten Baw in 
France, as a salad or relish, thus : The eater makes upon 
his plate a mixture of pepper, oil, vinegar, and salt, 
commonly called a Poivrade. He then takes the arti- 
choke in his left hand, holding it by the top or the tips 
of the leaves, and with the knife in his right hand he 
cuts successively from the bottom very ihin slices, to 
each of which is attached a leaf. Then, holding the leaf 
between his finger and thumb, he dips the sliced bottom 
into the poivradey and duly masticates it as he would 
uncooked celery, radishes, and the like ; and it is not a 
bit more wholesome or digestible. This " Receipt" for 
Maw Artichokes is given in the belief that (without 
ofience) it may enlighten a few of our countrymen. 
The Doctor would have been glad to see it in his younger 
days. The first time he ordered an artichoke in a 
Paris reatauranty the waiter brought him a raw one^ as a 
matter of course ; and lie did not know what to do with it. 

Artiohohesj Plain-Boiled. Tlirow them into plenty 
of boiling salt-and-water, and let them gallop away 
until quite tender. Full a leaf; if it comes away easily, 
ihey are done enough. Full-grown, forward artichokes 
will take about thrice as long to boil as those which are 
yomig and tender; it would therefore be absurd to 
attempt to state the number of minutes required to cook 
them. 

Boiling them in a large quantity of water helps to

remove their bitterness — a quality which is crften more 
str(»igly developed in autumnal than in summer arti- 
•chokes. When quite tender, serve them either in a 
vegetable-dish with a strainer at the bottom, or arranged 
neatly upon a napkin. 

Melted butter, or oiled butter, is commonly served 
with them ; in default of which, a dust of salt makes an 
excellent seasoning. Cold Boiled Artidiokes are very nice 
and wholesome, eaten with a little pepper, oil, and vinegar. 

There is another way of cooking them, which leaves 
more of their natural flavour, and consequently is pre- 
ferred by some. After washing well and shortening 
the stems, remove the small outer leaves at the bottom, 
and trim the artichokes as small as possible by cutting 
off the tips of the rest of the leaves. Put them in a 
stew-pan topsy-turvy, with no more water than will 
eover them, to which you will add both pepper and salt* 
Close the lid down tight by the help of a linen cloth, to 
keep in all the steam you can. 

Artichokes are much more generally used on the 
Continent than they are in England. They are grown 
on a large scale in the market-gardens; and are sold 
ready-boiled in numerous shops in Paris, covered with 
•doths to keep them hot. 

Stewed Arlichoke-'BoUoms. Boil as before. When 
done (not too much), remove the leaves and the woolly 
portion (the flowers) called the " choke,"* and trim the

fibres that may have imited them to the stem.

The artichoke-bottoms may be prepared the day 
before ; they can then be served stewed at a quarter of 
an hour's notice. 

This makes an elegant and agreeable dish ; but, to 
£11 it adequately, a good many of the bottoms are 
required; which (as the leaves are likewise rejected) 
makes it come expensive, except in neighbourhoods 
where artichokes are plentiful and cheap, or not appre- 
ciated by the residents: for the Doctor has known 
artichokes to be thrown away by people who did not 
appreciate or understand them.

and add a little sugar. 

Fried Artichokes. Cut them into six or eight pieces, 
according to their size ; take away the choke and the 
largest outside leaves, and cut off the tips of those which 
you leave. Wash them well in two or three waters; 
drain them, and dip them into batter made of flour, 
cream, and yolks of eggs. Fry them in plenty of oil or 
sweet pork-lard. As you take them out of the frying-

and di«h them on a bed of fried parsley.

it has no right whatever) has reference to its flavour. 

The great point in preparing Jerusalem Artichokes 
(after washing them) for cooking is, to have a basin of 
pump-water at hand, while peeling them, to throw the 
raw artichokes in, one by one, as soon as thej are peeled. 
This keeps the cut surface from contact with the air^ 
and prevents its turning black, as it would otherwise do ; 
exactly as a pared apple turns brown* 

Jerusalem Artichokes j Boiled. Throw them into boil- 
ing salt-and-water ; if large, from twenty to five-and- 
tweniy minutes will mostly do them ; if small, a quarter 
of an hour. When dished, pour over them a rich White 
Sauce, exactly like that for celery. 

Jerusalem Artichokesy Mashed. Boil a little longer 
than for serving whole ; then mash them, like Turnips, 
with pepper, salt, and cream or butter ; but they are less 
easy than turnips to mash smooth and free from lumps. 

Jerusalem Artichokes^ Fried. Small ones may be 
fried whole; large ones must be divided into two or 
three. Boil them half the time required to cook them ; 
let them drain and cooL Dip them in batter ; or smear 
them with egg and cover with bread-crumbs. Fiy them 
to a clear, light brown. They will be very poor, if there 
is any scant of fat to fry them in. When well done, 
they are thus converted into a sort of Fritter or BeigneL 

As a table-root, it must be confessed that some per-

plain-boiled, and then covered with white sauce ; or they 
are made to enter largely into the composition of such 
dishes as beef & la mode, harriooed mutton, ragoiits, ^, 
in the same way as young carrots, asparagus-tops, and 
green pease are used in summer. Jn either condition, 
they afford an agreeable and salutary variety to our list

and so hardy, that they deserve to be brought forward 
out of their present state of neglect, especially as they 
were not always so much despised and forgotten in 
Great Britain. Skirrets, particularly, were formerly 
much esteemed in cookery. In the north of Scotland, 
they were (and may be still, unless driven out by the

quest that he will guess what plant it is. 

Scorzonera^ or Spanish Salsify^ Boiled cr Friedy with 
exactly the same treatment as that for Salsify. 

The name of this ezoellent root is derived from two 
Spanish words, scorza — root, and nera — ^black ; and the 
uninviting colour of the outer rind greatly restricts its 
general use. Housekeepers do not like to waste their 
time in scraping it ; but in the markets of most large 
towns in France, Scorzonera may be bought ready 
cleaned for cooking. 

Scorzonera differs from salsify in not being fit for 
use till the second year; and so far the progress of its 
vegetation is remarkable. Other esculent roots, after 
having flowered and ripened their seed, become tough, 
woody, and uneatable ; but scorzonera, sown in spring in 
rich soil, quickly forms its long, straight roots, without 
putting forth any ramifications. The majority of the 
plants display their yellow flowers, and subsequently bear 
seed. If those plants were taken up theuy they would 
be found so stringy as to be useless for the table ; but in 
the spring of the following year, the fibres have dis- 
appeared, the roots become fleshy, tender, and full of 
milky juice, exactly as they were before flowering ; and 
they continue to increase in size, without losing their 
good qualities. — Delamer. 

Chicory^Boots are eaten on the Continent, in the same 
way as Salsify and Scorzonera. They are more bitter

CarrotSy Stewed. A spring or early summer dish of 
vegetables. Take young short-horn carrots, that have

walnuts. The fresher gathered they are, the better ; re- 
quest the gardener to cut off the green tops immediately 
they are drawn out of the ground. Cut off their tails ; 
ecrapey not peel them, leaving them in their natural 
shape ; throw them into cold water until you cook thenu 

Put your carrots into a stew-pan, and more than 
cover them with good veal or beef stock, duly seasoned 
with salt, spice, herbs, and vegetables. Keep the lid on 
the stew-pan tiU it boils, then finish cooking the carrots 
(which will take from twenty minutes to half an hour) 
with the lid off, in order to reduce the stock by evapora- 
tion. When its quantity is much diminished, stir now 
and then, to prevent burning, and to cook the carrots 
equally. 

When quite tender, transfer the carrots with a spoon 
to a deep vegetable-dish ; if the sauce is sufficiently thick 
and savoury, pour it over them at once. If not, bring 
it to your taste with a little browning and seasoning ; 
but a rich gravy is all that you require, as it is not de- 
sirable to overpower the delicate flavour of young frame- 
grown carrots.

'N.B. Some cooks, when uncertain who shelled the 
pease, do wash them in as little water as will cover them, 
skhnming off the dust, Ac as they rise to the snr&oe 
of the water. They say it is the only way of effectually 
getting rid of them. They then carefiilly dry the pease 
in a napkin. The onions, also, are often omitted ; or the 
hearts of lettuces are substituted for them : the main 
principle of this mode of cooking being, that the pease 
are stewed in their own sap^ which, and the steam arising 
from it, are retained by the butter varnishing and stopping 
the pores of the skin. This method has the further 
advantage of subduing the hardness of not very young 
pease, without losing the juices of the younger ones that 
may happen to be mixed with them. 

Green Pease j English Fashion. These you may wash ; 
but not in more water, nor leaving them longer in it^ 
than necessaiy. 

Drain them well in cullender ; throw them into little 
more boiling water than will cover them. Put into the 
water a small saltspoon of salt, a lump of sugar (if the 
pease are not of a sweet variety), and, if the water is 
hard, half as much carbonate of soda as will lie on a six-

a sprig of mint is a matter of taste ; it is appropriate if

the pease are to accompany lamb, calf's head, or other 
meat eaten with any kind of sweet-herb sauce. But, as 
some persons dislike mint, the head of the house should 
be consulted respecting its use. 

Pease cooked in this way must not be overdone, 
otherwise their sweetness goes into the water. When 
tender, drain the water away from them ; transfer them 
firom the cullender to a ^ery hx>t vegetable dish ; stick in 
amongst them a lump of butter, and, as it melts, stir 
them about a little with a spoon warmed by plunging it 
into boiling water. Some serve the sprigs of boiled mint 
together with the peas ; they are unsightly, but indicate 
the flavour which predominates. 

Besides the English varieties of pease, early and late,, 
which are excellent, first-rate indeed, — and new ones, 
at least in name, are annually raised by our gardeners, — 
there are races of kitchen pease, less known in Eng- 
land than on the Continent, namely, the Sugar Pease, 
the Zuckererbse of the Germans, and the Pais sans 
parchemm^ Skinless Pease, and Mange-tout^ Eat-alls, of 
the French. In these, the peaahell is imusually de- 
veloped in fleshiness, succulence, and sweetness. As 
the inner lining of skin and the stringy fibres are 
also wanting in the best varieties, the peascod& of 
these are cooked entire or divided, as we cook French 
Beans, only slowly stewed for a long time in butter or 
gravy. 

Those who have a garden, and cannot procure Sugar 
Pease at market, can grow them as easily as any other 
kind of pea.

The Peashells of our ordinaiy pease maj be made to 
render service in two quite different ways. 

Peashell Browning^ for Soups, After shelling pease, 
select the cleanest, plumpest, and most uninjured of the 
shells. Put a single layer of them (as dose together as 
you please, but not heaped) on an iron plate, such as 
you bake cakes on. Set them into a slow oven, of such 
a temperature as to dry and hrown^ without burning or 
charring them. This may also be done in an American 
oven before the fire ; but in either case it requires time 
and patient watching. When done, they will keep in a 
dry doset. Half a dozen or more of these browned pea- 
shells, thrown into soup or broth while cooking, will not 
only impart a nice golden hue, but also be an improve- 
ment to its flavour. 

Peashell Purie^ for Soups and Stews. AAer shelling- 
pease, reject any of the shells that are dirty, bruised, or 
otherwise injured. Wash the rest in a pail of water ; 
first pour off the foreign matters that rise to the top, then 
transfer the peashells to a boiler ; cover them with cold 
spring-water, with a spoonful of salt in it, and boil 
slowly for an hour or more, with care that none of the- 
peashells stick to the bottom. 

Pass the liquor through a large-holed cullender, and 
add to it all you can squeeze out of the peashells with 
the back of a wooden spoon. Strain it again through a 
finer-holed cullender, and it is ready to heighten the 
flavour of Green Pease or other vegetable soups, or oF

French BeaM^ Kidney Beans j Haricots VertSy of very 
many varieties and qualities. When quite young, i.e. 
not fidl grown, the only preparation and trimming they 
reqnire is to toe and heel them, by taking off the tip and 
the stalk at its junction with the pod. If older, the 
string which runs down the back of the pod must be 
peeled away, and the pod cut once across ; if still older, 
larger, and broader, they may also be either slit down 
the middle, or cut across slantwise into several pieces. 

On the Continent, favourite varieties are those in 
which the strings of the pod and its inner lining-skin are 
either absent, or reduced to almost nothing, so that no 
knife is needed for trimming the pods. They are prepared 
by simply breaking them in two with the fingers ; when 
the thread, if any, will come away of itself. These 
varieties, too, are perfectly suitable for the kitchen at 
an advanced stage of maturity, when the seeds are ap- 
proaching to ripeness ; they are consequently mealy and 
nntritiousy while the pod is at the same time more fully 
charged with sugar and mucilage. 

After this preparation, throw your kidney beans, of 
whatever age or kind, into cold water for half an hour. 
Then throw them into plenty of boiling soft water, with 
a little salt in it, and boil them galloping, and uncoveredy 
until tender ; which can only be known by trying them 
from time to time. The time they take to cook is so 
variable, that all that can be said about it is, that for 
young and tender kidney beans it will be not less than 
twenty minutes. If your water is hard, you must make 
it soft by a pinch of carbonate of soda : that is, if you

HaruxnU VertSy French Faahioriy comprises several 
different ways of serving them. French cooks often 
plain-boil their Elidney Beans, and, when enoagh, set 
ihem aside to cool, to be ready for dressing afterwards. 
A common and agreeable mode of heating them up is : 

Kidney BeanSy with PcarsUy asid (OHed) Butter^ C!hop 
young and tender parsley-leaves fine ; put them into a 
stew-pan with a lamp of sweet, fresh butter ; then add 
your cold, ready-cooked Kidney Beans. Keep stirring 
while the butter is melting, so that the beans may be 
completely oiled, and the chopped parsley equally dis- 
tributed amongst them. That done, cover down dose 
with the lid, and simmer gendy for a quarter of an hour 
or twenfy minutes. 

Haricots Verts au Gras — Kidney Beans toith Meat 
Gravy. Have ready cooked Kidney Beans, as before. 
Fry with butter, in a stew-pan, parsley and onions, both

your cold kidney beans (which should have been well

and pour it over them. 

Cold Kidney Beans make an excellent Scdad^ and are 
very oommonly eaten under that guise, especially the 
kinds which are presentable with the seeds advanced in 
ripeness. All that is required is, to drain them 
thoroughly while cooling, and then to dress them with 
oil and vinegar, or any other form of salad-mixtnre that 
may be preferred. Besides this, they are often sprinkled 
with fine-chopped parsley, or seedling onions, or chives, 
or chervil, or tarragon-leaves — the two latter in quite 
small quantity : they can likewise enter into the com- 
position of a Mayonnaise, or any other fancy salad. In 
short, French cooks, from the highest to the lowest, 
never waste cold kidney beans : they would prefer to eat 
them themselves ; which is a great deal to say of any 
kitchen remnant. 

White Haricots, the dried seeds of certain varieties of 
kidney bean. The skins of these must be removed before 
coohng; which is ^effected^ either by steeping them in 
soft water overnight, or, more effectually and readily, 
by pouring boiling water over them, and letting them 
stand in it until it is cold, then pouring that away, and 
again pouring boiling water over them, and leaving them 
in it until they are cool enough to be handled, when it 
will be found that their coats will easily come away. 

Put them on to boil in as much cold soft water as 
will cover them, filling up with hot water as it is 
absorbed by the beans and escapes by evaporation. 
When thoroughly cooked, there should be no more

and chives (or seedling onions), pepper and salt, and a 
dash of vinegar. Mix well, heat up thoroughly, and 
serve. Tou may substitute lemon-juice for the vinegar 
—or suppress them both. 

This light and nutritious winter vegetable dish ought 
to appear oftener than it does on English tables. Not 
only has it the convenience of being meager in itself, but 
it makes an excellent accompaniment to any kind of 
meat or poultry.

all is thoronghlj heated, without actually hoiling. When 
that is done, they are ready to serve. 

This dish goes well with boiled fowl or turkey, boiled 
breast of veal and oyster sauce, sweetbreads served white,, 
and other things of the kind. 

Cold Boiled White Haricots are very generally served

chopped parsley, chervil, chives, or seedling onions; 
sliced onions, baked beetroot, cold potatoes; celery^

Scarlet Runners will hardly be eaten by those who

wards.

although it is coarse, and is not so substantial as popular 
prejudice holds it to be. Its substantiabiliij is oftea 
made out bj the quantity eaten, and bj the bread and 
cheese and beer employed to fill every remaining crevice 
in the stomach. It belongs to the category of rustic 
feasts, 

''Where Corydon and Thynis met, 
Are at their 8aT*r7 dinner set 
Of herbs, and other oonntrj messes. 
Which the neat-handed Phyllis dresses." 

The only direction we need give to Phyllis is, not to put 
in her beans until the bacon has begun to boil. 

Broad Beans are best taken when about three-parts 
grown, while young and tender, and the skins can still 
be eaten. Throw them into boiling water with a tea- 
spooniul of salt in it. When done, drain them ; pile 
them in a hot dish, and thrust a bit of butter into the 
heap, exactly as for Qreen Pease, English Fashion. 

N.B. French cooks boil with Broad Beans, sprigs of 
sarriette, or Summer Savory (as we do mint with Pease), 
and a great improvement it is (to our taste), the flavour 
of Summer Savory being more delicate and less over- 
powering than that of mint. It is an annual plant, of 
the easiest culture ; when once established in a garden, 
it will sow itself, if allowed, like mignonette. 

Broad Beans and Cream (Full-grown). Boil them

summer savory chopped very fine. Give them a few

all is well heated, take up your beans, pile them on a hot 
dish ; thicken the cream with yolk of egg, and pour it 
over the beans. 

Asparagusy Boiled. Procure it as fresh-cut as possible. 
Scrape off the outer skin from the white end of each 
shoot; cnt them into nearly equal lengths; tie them 
with string into small bundles of five or six shoots each, 
and throw them into cold water till cooking-time comes. 

Then throw the little bundles into boiling salt-and- 
water, and let them boil galloping, without the lid, till 
tender, which will take from tweniy minutes to half an 
hour. 

Lay toasted bread at the bottom of your vegetable- 
dish. Take out your litde bundles of asparagus with a 
fork, and untie them over this, depositing the heads of 
asparagus on the toast, all lying in one direction. If the 
water which drains from them be not enough to soak 
the toast (in this case called the ^^ sippet"), pour over 
them a spoonful or two from the saucepan. 

You may either pour melted butter over asparagus, 
or serve it separately in a butter-boat. On the Conti- 
nent, oiled butter is often eaten with asparagus, and an 
excellent sauce for that vegetable it is. 

Asparoffusy in imitation of Green Pease. Take the 
slim, green, run-up shoots of young asparagus-plants, 
which are not old enough to produce ordinary aspara*

Itaye^ and cut ihem into short lengths ahont the size of 
marrowfat pease. Then treat them exactlj like Green 
Pease, French Fashion. . 

These are used rather to go with meats cooked a la 
Jardinih'€y stewed Pigeons, and other things of llie 
kind, before real green pease come in, than to be served 
as a dish by themselves. The cook, doubtless, finds 
them useful ; but the gardener's opinion maj be taken 
whether the removal of these shoots do not injure his 
young asparagus-plants, and retard their production of 
asparagus really worthy of the name. 

Sorrel is a curious instance of the high estimation 
which one country may accord to things that are utterly 
despised and neglected in another. Sorrel is one of the 
Frenchman's staves of life. With its raw leaves he 
eats his afternoon crust of bread. With it he makes his 
meager-day soup ; on it he deposits his feast-day fid- 
candeau. It purifies his blood, opens his appetite, and 
regulates his digestive apparatus. So necessary is sorrel 
to his cookery, that it is salted and boiled down for 
winter use. 

The dressing of sorrel is of the simplest. In springs 
when tender, it is merely shorn firom the crown of the 
plant, washed, roughly drained, put into a stew-pan 
with a bit of butter and the water adhering to it, and 
then worked over the fire with a spoon into a pur^ or 
mash. In summer, if the midrib of the leaf is tough, 
the green part of the leaf on each side is stripped off, 
and then stewed down to a mash as before. 

Sorrel so treated is excellent to accompany yeal 



VEGETABLES. 559 

cntlets, fricandeans, poached eggs, boiled sausages, and 
oliher little things of the kind. Many cooks also dilate 
its aciditj hy a liberal admixture of spinach, orache, 
chervil, and especially the patience-dock, whose in- 
sipidity it greatly relieves. A little sorrel may also 
be advantageously combined with chopped-up cabbages 
or turnip-tops, to be served with pork-chops, broiled 
iddneys, sausages, &c Moreover, a Pur^ of Sorrel 
may be enriched with egg-yolks, flour, cream, and 
{for non-abstinence days) meat-gravy or consomm& 
In any case, wash the sorrel well, that there be no 
grit adhering to the leaves. 

Spinach requires a deal of dressing, and likewise of 
^^ additionals. " A gentleman who was fond of having his 
vegetables ffood^ managed his spinach after this fashion : 

Say it was boiled on Monday, and sent to table, 
properly seasoned, as the cook supposed: it went 
away untouched. The next day it was warmed, with 
an additional piece of butter, and again not eaten ; 
and so on for four or five days, each time absorbing 
more butter; until at last, our gourmand, finding it 
sufficiently good, made an end of it 

Spinach may be boiled in plenty of water. The 
orthodox way is to put it on the fire with a bit of 
butter and only the water adhering to the leaves, in 
a dose-covered stew-pan. When tender, take it out, 
chop it fine, and return to the stew-pan to be treated 
with pepper or nutmeg, salt, more butter, and cream or 
gravy. Spread it on your dish, smooth the surfiuse, 
and garnish with fined bits of bread.

Several pot-herbs and salad-plants maj be treated 
like spinach, especiallj with the help of a dash of sorrel. 
We might call them spinach of endive, of chicoij-leaves, 
of orache, of dandelion-leaves. Endive so cooked ap- 
proaches the flavour of sea-kale. Corn-salad or lamb* 
lettuce makes an excellent spinach ; and the roughest 
gardener can have it in abundance in earlj spring, when 
other vegetables are scarce. Indeed, this humble little 
plant runs up to seed so soon that its seasons are autumn, 
winter, and early spring. 

Potatoes J Boiled. Ought potatoes to be set on to cook 
in hot water or in cold? Theoiy answers at once, ^^in 
hot." Practice observes that every thing must depend 
upon the quality of the potato. Waxy potatoes, like 
some of the small Dutch kinds, may be thrown into 
boiling water. But if very mealy potatoes are treated 
in the same way, their ouisides will fall to pieces, 
and be dissolved in the water, while their insides stiD 
are hard. Such potatoes, therefore, must be set on in 
cold water, in order to heat gradually and equally 
through, and to cause their whole substance to be 
cooked through at nearly the same moment 

The same reasoning applies to the question whether 
potatoes should be cooked wiih their jackets or without 



VEGETABLES. 561 

ihem. Waxy potatoes may be cooked peeled; mealy 
potatoes are best cooked mipeeled, to have their skins 
removed after cooking, and drying in the saucepan with 
the water poured away from them. 

Mashed Potatoes must be mealy, well cooked, and 
yet not sloppy, but thoroughly dry. Heat the bowl 
before you put them in (to*help to drive off moistore), 
and mash them to a pulp (or rather to a pasty powder) 
with a wooden spoon. You may add a little dust of 
salt, and perhaps pepper, if desired. But some cooks 
mix in butter and milk or cream, which are all very well 
if you want a purie ofpoUUoesj which is a thing by itself, 
quite different from genuine mashed potatoes. The former 
you may make with any inferior quality of potato ; the 
latter, in its perfection, is to be obtained only from the 
most floury, and is one of the nicest ways of dressing 
that vegetable. 

Mailed Potatoes may be served simply heaped on 
the dish; 

Or, when so dished, they may be set under a 
salamander, to have their surface browned, which will 
also help to drive off superfluous moisture ; 

Or, they may be put into a pudding-basin or mould 
(buttered inside), and set into the oven just long enough 
to gild the surface in contact with the mould. They 
are thus not only heated and dried, but their cooking is 
thoroughly consummated. 

Sautid (commonly called) Fried Potatoes. One of 
the nicest things in the world when well done, and one 
of the nastiest, ill-done.

Wash the potatoes before jon peel them ; wipe tbem 
dry, and then peel them. Wipe them again after peel- 
ing. Small potatoes (less than a walnut) may be sauted 
whole; larger ones must be divided or sliced. After 
division or slicing, dry them well between the folds of a 
napkin. 

Tou may sant6 potatoes in either pork-lard, butter,, 
or oil ; but whichever you use, you must have enough 
of it. You may saut£ potatoes in quite a small pipkin,, 
provided it be deep enough. 

When your fat is hot, put your potatoes into it (not 
too many at once), and keep stirring them about until 
they are evenly coloured all over of a clear, light brown, 
and mealy and soft insida Properly done, they are diy, 
not greasy, and may be eaten like a biscuit without soil- 
ing the fingers. The operation is one which ought to be 
seen done, and is well worth taking a lesson in. 

The TomatOj although a firuit, ftdfils the office of 
a vegetable. It is not common enough in England 
to be used on a large scale for soups or sauces, but 
makes a handsome side-dish to accompany various^ 
meats, by being boiled whole, for about five minutes^ 
in any good stock or gravy, and served in it without 
losing its original form. 

Mushrooms are principally consumed as buttons in 
pickles, sauces, stews, and ragoiits. Large open brown

Farmer. Yon are willing to make yourself useful, are 
you ? But why did you run away from your last place ? 
Candidate Ploughboy. They giv' me sich a lot o* 
salad all the summer, that I was a-feared they'd make 
me eat hay in the winter. 

^^ Salad cools without weakening, and comforts with- 
out irritating ; I even hold that it helps people to grow 
young again." — Brillat Savarin. 

The above contradictory sentiments fidrly represent 
the different estimation in which salad is held on the 
opposite sides of the English ChanneL The quantity of 
salad eaten in England amounts only to a fractional part 
of the mass which is consumed in France. For, there^ 
it is grown not merely as the rich man's luxuiy, but as 
the sustenance of the labourer. 

What is Salad ? Some reader may answer, '^ Un- 
cooked lettuce shred into a bowl ;" which is as if he 
were to define " a Tart" to be " Raspberries and Cur- 
rants baked under a crust" It is the minor, but not the 
major, of the question ; the individual does not comprise 
the class. After reflection, we cannot limit the term 
^^ Salad" more closely than as ^^ A preparation of food to

be eaten cold^ one or more of whose ingredients have 
been obtained from the vegetable kingdom." For we 
find, amongst others, a Salad of Potatoes, a Salad of 
Eels, a Salad of Partridges, a Salad of Chicken, and a 
Salad of Oranges ; the latter dressed in the same way as 
a Salad of Uncooked Pears, onlj substituting rum for 
brandj in the seasoning. 

In the matter of Salads we have greatlj degenerated. 
Evelyn's Aeetaria^ or Discourse of SalUtSj proves (even 
although pickles are included in the term*) that a more 
varied and artistical sallet could be served two hundred 
years back, than now ; and that our only mode of ad-

and exhilarating a quality." ^^ Sampler/' too^ is cmeDy 
neglected both bs a pickle and a salad-plant. In short, 
one of the great difficulties of modem times is, What is 
t^ mode of dressing «aS^? Family quarrels have arisen 
on the subject; and the salad«bowl may yet lead to di« 
Yorces h mensdy especially as we have now no supreme 
professor powerful enough to command by his dictum the 
acquiescence of the gastronomic world. 

Some of our readers may be old enough, like our* 
selves, to remember hearing their parents or grand- 
parents mention the Frenchman who used to dress salads 
in London, for the modest fee of a guinea per salad. 
The iact is perfectly historical, and he was led to take up 
that profession thus : 

He was a Limousin gentleman, who had escaped to 
England during the horrors of the first French Bevolu- 
tion. His name was D'Aubignac or D'AIbignac Al- 
though his finances were very restricted and his pittance 
small, he nevertheless happened to be dining one day in 
one of the best London taverns : for he was a believer in 
the system that you can dine well off one single dish, 
provided that dish be excellent of its kind. 

While he was finishing a slice of juicy roast beef, 
five or six young dandies of aristocratic birth were 
feasting at a neighbouring table. One of them rose, 
stepped up to him, and said politely, ^^ Monsieur French- 
man, it is reported that your nation excels in the art of 
dressing salad. Would you have the goodness to oblige 
us by dressing one for us ?" 

After some hesitation, D'Albignac consented. He 



SALADS. 567 

^sailed for what he judged necessary to execute the master* 
piece that was expected of him, set to work with a will, 
and had the good luck to succeed. 

While measuring out his doses, he frankly replied to 
the questions that were put to him respecting his present 
position. He said that he was an 4migri^ and avowed, 
not without a blush, that he received assistance from the 
English Government — a circumstance which doubtless 
authorised the young men to slip a five-pound note into 
his hand, and which he accepted after making a dight 
resistance. 

He had given them his address ; and, therefore, a few 
dajB afterwards he was not greatly surprised at receiving 
a letter begging him, in the most gentlemanly terms, to 
come and dress a salad at one of the best houses in 
Grosvenor Square. D'Albignac, perceiving at once the 
friture advantages that might ensue, did not hesitate an 
instant. He arrived punotaally, armed with a stock of 
such ingredients as he judged likely to give his work the 
highest finish. On this occasion, he had the time to re- 
flect and arrange the composition of his salad beforehand. 
He again achieved a success, and received a gratification 
which made a handsome addition to his scanty income. 

The young gentlemen for whom he had operated in 
the first instance had, as may be supposed, vaunted even 
to exaggeration the merit of the salad which he had 
dressed for them. The second party made even more 
fuBS about the matter; so that D^Albignac's reputation 
43pread like wild-fire. He was qualified as ^^The 
Fashionable Salad-Maker," and all the exquisites in the 



568 SALADS. 

metropolis were pining for salad of ihe Frencliman*8 
making. ^^ I am dying for it/' was the expression of the 

day- 4 

D'Albignac acted like a wise man in not allowing 

the opportunity to slip. He soon started a yehide to 
transport himself more rapidly to the different localities 
where he was sent for, together with a servant, canying 
in a mahogany chest all the ingredients with which be 
had enriched his stock — ^snch as vinegars of various 
aromatic flavours, oils with or without the taste of finit, 
soy, caviare, truffles, anchovies, ketchup, savoury jelly, 
and even hard-boiled egg-yolks, which are the dis- 
tinctive character of a Mayonnaise. 

At a later period he got similar salad-chests made, 
which he completely fiimished with the necessary ma- 
terials, and sold by hundreds. Li short, by pursuing his 
novel profession with prudence, politeness, and punctu- 
ality, he made a little fortune of eighty thousand fi'ancs, 
or upwards of three thousand pounds, with which he 
returned to France when the times became more settled. 
He made no attempt to shine in Paris society, but pro- 
vided for his fiiture maintenance. He invested sixty 
thousand francs in the public fimds, which were then 
down to 50 ; and with the remaining twenty thousand 
he bought a little property in the Limousin, where he 
lived to a good old age, happy and contented, because he 
knew how to limit his desires, and to cut his garment 
according to his doth. 

As a General Rule for Salady be prodigal of oil, 
prudent with salt, and parsimonious with vinegar. But 



BAUIDB. 569 

every salad-maker will not admit all those ingredients, 
few as thej are. Take, for instance, 

JEast^Anglian Salady a preparation well deserving an 
impartial trial. Shred cos lettuce (cabbage-lettuce is not 
crisp enough) tolerably fine into a bowl. Just moisten 
it with a very little vinegar — enough to let you know 
that vinegar is there — sprinkle it with sugar (not too 
much) and serve immediately. 

Many a literary genius has amused himself with 
salad-making. Amongst others, we give, as probably 
new to many of our readers, 

Alexander Dumas^s Winter Salad. I nearly fill — 
the great romancer tells us — my salad-bowl with rounds 
of beetroot, slices of celeiy, rampion-roots, with their 
plume of blanched leaves, and boiled potatoes. 

At the outset, I clap a dish on the salad-bowl, turn 
the latter topsy-turvy, placing the full dish beside me, 
and the empiy bowl before me. 

I then put into the salad-bowl a hard yolk of egg for 
every two persons — six yolks for a dozen guests. I 
crush them in oil till they form a paste. To this paste I 
add chervil, crushed tunny (which may be bought pre- 
served in bottles), pounded anchovies, some of Maille's 
mustard, a large spoonful of soy, gherkins cut in slices, 
and the whites of the hard eggs chopped in pieces. 
Finally, I moisten the whole with the very best vinegar 
I can procure. Then, and then only, I restore the salad 
to the bowl, causing it to be weU stirred by my domestio 
[the bumptious bone in the great man's arm prevented 
his stirring it himself] ; and, on the stirred-up salad,

JEndwej in SalacL There are two verj distinct kinds

Blanched Chicory Scdad, This and the following 
excellent salads, though largely nsed on the Continent, 
are rarelj to be bought in English markets out of 
London. But as their growth and blanching are so 
easj and simple that any body with a little bit of ground 
may cultivate them, we abridge Mr. Cuthill's directions, 
from Delamer's Kitchen Grarden : 

^^ When the plants have done growing, some time in 
November, the crop of chicory-roots is dug up and 
stored. In cutting off the leaves, you must not injure 
the centre ; for out of the centre comes all the salad. In 
1836, I had a quantity of mould put into a cellar, and 
planted a bed of chicory-roots as soon as they were taken 
up from where they had grown during the sunmier. I 
planted three hundred roots in the bed, keeping them 
four inches apart, with light and air entirely excluded. 
They soon began to grow, producing long, fine, cream* 
coloured leaves ; and when about six inches long, I sent 
them in as salad, cutting off the leaves carefully ; for if 
you cut into the quick, it would stop a second, third^ 
and fourth crop of leaves which a root produces, until its 
cells are as empty as a honey-comb or until entirely 
exhausted. From the number of plants in the cellar, I 
could have supplied ten such families as that I lived 
with ; but it was not until the severe winter of 1838 that 
I sufficiently appreciated the use of chicory as salad» 



SALADS. 573 

The firost and snow were severe : all endive, lettaoe, and 
celery was gone rotten. Our salads were the best in 
London. Everj one that dined inquired what it was, 
and eveiy one ordered it to be grown afterwards. 

"When I came here (to Camberwell), I grew the 
roots with the view of introducing chicory salad into 
Covent-Gkrden Market. I had it planted into a pit where 
there was a flue, and covered the glass with mats to 
exclude the light I had also five or six roots put into a 
large-sized pot, and turned the next smaller-sized pot 
reversed over the heads, stopping the hole in the 
bottom of the top pot, to exclude air. This last 
is a very easy method, and it answers well for a 
small family, just putting in a few pots in heat any 
where.'* But when he had grown it, he had a diffiouliy 
in getting rid of it. No one had ever seen it — ^no one 
had ever heard of it — and no one would buy it. " But 
I am in hopes," Mr. Cuthill philosophically continues, 
" even now to see it largely brought into public markets. 
It sometimes takes many years' hard fighting to persuade 
people to their own benefit" 

The growing of chicory salad at home, in pots, 
would be made still easier by buying ^ instead of growing 
one's self, the chicory-roots to be so planted ; in that case, 
the salad-grower does not want a garden at all, but only 
a dark, warm cellar or outhouse to set the pots in. 

Chicory, without being " the finest of all salads, the 
finest of all tonic bitters," as Mr. Cuthill holds, is, 
nevertheless, very pleasant and wholesome, and par- 
ticularly welcome in the dead time of winter* Its

inviting appearance is also mnch in its &yonr. It 
is dressed exactly as endive salad, except that tarragon- 
leaves (unless forced) will be hard to procure; bat 
there will be little diflScoliy about chervil and chives 
(or the green of onions) at any season; and a litde^ 
water-cress, or garden-cress and mustard, can h& 
chopped fine and used to sprinkle it with. 

Bcarbe de Capueiny or CapudMs Beof'dj is' a delicate 
salad, which is consumed in large quantities in Paris^ 
during winter and early spring. It is the same thing 
as the foregoing chicory ; only the object of the French 
gardeners is to get the roots as small, instead of, like 
Mr. Cuthill, as fine, as possible. For this purpose^ 
chicory-seed is sown late in spring, broadcast, and rery 
thick, on poor, meager soil. The result is, that the 
chicory is starved, and a quantity of long, straight^ 
slender roots are produced. At the commencement of 
winter, these roots are taken up and tied in bundles (of 
about the size you can grasp with both your hands), 
after all their leaves are removed, care being taken not 
to injure the central bud. This task is a work of 
patience. The bundles of chicory-roots are then removed 
to a perfectiy dark cellar, where a bed of garden-mould 
has been prepared. The bundles are roughly and dosely 
planted in the bed; the roots soon begin to vegetate, 
and send forth long, narrow, yellowish-white leaves, 
which constitute the salad. The bunches are simply 
taken up and brought to market, roots and all, just aft 
they are ; and the sample so offered really has a slight 
resemblance to the hoaiy beard of some venerable monk.

This and chioorj are admirably adapted for fhrnishing 
salads on shipboard, when a vessel is far awaj from land. 
Boots planted inside barrels half-filled with mould, as^ 
thick as they will pack, would afford a welcome supply ». 
The barrel-head would help to blanch it ; and on board 
ocean-steamers there would be little difficully in forcing^ 
a succession of salads at pleasure. — Dehmer. 

Capuchin's Beard is a wholesome salad, although^ 
there is a slight bitterness in its flavour, which to many 
people is far from disagreeable ; of course, like all other 
imoooked vegetables, its digestion is aided by complete 
mastication. The dressing is the same as for Endive 
and Chicory. 

Dcmdelion Salad. Li the north of France, this plant 
is gathered in spring, just as it grows in the fields and 
pastures. If its shoots happen to be partially blanched 
by the earth of a molehill, all the better. Its consump- 
tion by the French population is very considerable. 
Even in Paris, wild dandelion is largely sold for salads. 
In this state, however, it is both too tough and too bitter 
for British palates ; respecting its wholesomeness for those 
who can eat and digest it, there can be little doubt. 

Both the toughness and the bitterness of Dandelion 
salad may be got rid of by blanching it thus : 

Late in autumn, or at the beginning of winter, collect 
a quantity of dandelion plants. Pick off all the leaves, 
leaving the crowns of the plants and the roots uninjured,, 
although the latter may be shortened if inconvenientiy 
long or forked. Plant them as thick as they will stow 
in flower-potS; in any common garden-mould, with their 



576 BALADS. 

crowns on a level with the edge of the poL Give one 
good watering, to settle the earth about the roots. When 
thej have drained, set them away in any convenient 
comer of a dark^ warm cellar. Complete darkness is 
indispensable to success. After a certain lapse of time, 
depending on the temperature, you will find that the 
dandelions have sent up shoots of ivoiy whiteness. They 
are fit to cut when about three, or not more than fi>nr, 
inches long, and make an agreeable salad, fresh and crisp, 
delicate in substance, with a delicious nutty flavour. No 
one, who was not aware, would ever guess the despised 
weed which furnished them. Dandelion salad, more or 
less completely blanched (mostly by means of earth and 
sand) is also sold in French markets, but of course much 
dearer than in the natural state. The second cutting 
afibrded by the plants is only trifling in quantity. 
Persons willing to give it a trial, might readily import 
it in spring (as Queen Elizabeth obtained her salads 
fix)m Flanders), were it not so easily grown at home. 

Dress in the same way as Capuchin's Beard, or 
simply with oil and vinegar. 

This, and one or two oilier salad-plants, says Dela- 
mer, are worth mentioning, if only for the purpose of 
reminding the reader of the resources open to soldiers 
and sailors when marching across country, encamped, 
out at sea, or landed on a wild coast Many plants, that 
would be scorned by the gentlemen of England who sit 
at home at ease, would be thankfiilly received, both as 
pleasant and healthful, by the working members of our 
army and navy.

The Doctor^ s Salad^ for Gkla Days. Boil three eggs 
very hard, i. e. let them hoU galloping not less than a 
quarter of an honr. When quite cold (which may be 
hastened by throwing them into water &esh from the 
pmnp), take them out of their shells, cut them in halves 
lengthwise, and remove the yolks. Save the whites; 
chop the yolks as fine as you can, put them into a small 
basin, pour over them a table-spoonful of salad-oil, and 
crush all together as smooth as possible with the back of 
a silver spoon. When well incorporated, add gradually, 
stirring all the while vsith aforh^ two more table-spoon- 
fuls of oil. 

Put a good mustard-spoonful of made mustard into 
a table-spoon ; fill up with vinegar, and mix with your 
fork. Then gradually work the mustard and vinegar, 
with your fork, into the oil and egg-yolk. Put no 
pepper and no salt. When smooth and creamy, and free 
from knots, this makes Sahd Mixture^ A. % 

Take the yellow hearts only of fine cabbage-lettuces ; 
pick them to pieces leaf by leaf; wash and drain them 
thoroughly. When perfectly firee from adhering moisture, 
fill your salad-bowl with them three-quarters full ; pour 
your mixture over the salad, and mingle thoroughly. 
Surround the inside of the bowl with a row or garland 
of brown, orange, and yellow nasturtium-flowers. Cut 
the hard whites of egg into long, narrow strips, and with 
them form a star in the middle of the salad. At the end 
of each ray of the star drop a blue borage-flower (with- 
out the calyx); if you have white borage-flowers also, 
place them alternately blue and white. Cover the dressed

salad exposed to view with a few bits or leaves of fresh 
undressed, and serve as soon as the operation is finished. 
Dressed salad should never have to wait long; the 
vmegar in the dressing causes it to fade, and soon 
deprives it of all its crispness. 

N.B. The flowers are intended to be eaten. 

Salad Mixture^ B. For those who are prejudiced 
against the very name of oU, often because thej never 
tasted it ; or, possibly, tasted it without knowing what 
it was. 

Into a small basin put a teaspoonful of mustard in 
flour, a salt-spoonfiil of salt, and half that quantity of 
pepper ; work into these gradually a teacupful of the 
very best cream. Then stir in, according to its strength, 
a dessert- or a table-spoonful of vinegar, which may be 
tarragon or other aromatised vinegar. Keep the mixture 
continually stirred until you pour it over the salad. 

Salad Mixture J C, for the same class of eaters. At 
the bottom of a basin put three raw egg-yolks, mustard- 
flour, salt, and pepper, as before, and a bumping table- 
spoon of fresh, rich cream. When these are thoroughly 
incorporated, with a fork stir in the juice of one or two 
lemons, according to the degree of acidify liked. Again 
stir, imtQ the mixture is applied to the salad.

Dr. Eitchener'a Cooked Salad. Arnmgd in a tasty 
way, in the centre of a deep dish, a pile of cold cauli-

flower, delicate cabbage (with the water well squeezed 
ont), asparagus-tops, sea-kale, green pease, kidney beans, 
artichoke-bottoms, or whatever vegetable happens to be 
in season. A variety is advantageous rather than not. 
When nicely packed together in a heap, pour over the 
whole a liberal allowance of salad mixture, — ^which may 
he made with aromatised pickle vinegar, and have a 
table-spoonful of capers, pickled nasturtium-buds, or 
^chopped gherkins thrown into it. As a final decoration, 
ahred very finely over ihe snrfeoe a few fresh leaves of 
either cos or cabbage lettuce, so as just to conceal what 
lies beneath them. 

This makes a nice dish in sultry weather,^-oooling, 
yet not insipid, and light of digestion. By making a 
foundation for the cold-cooked vegetables with joints of 
cold fowl or game, cold roast veal, or other meat, you 
have a sort of Chartreuse Salad^ which is substantial as 
well as acetarious. Crab and lobster, or cold fish, — as 
^salmon, turbot, sole, or eels, — can likewise so make their 
%inexpected entrance. They will thus nearly approach 
a Mayonnaise. With fish, a sprinkling of picked shrimps, 
together with the fresh-shred lettuce-leaves, makes a 
pretty addition to the dish. ' 

Seedling 'Lettuce Salad, A favourite Continental 
-spring salad consists of tiny lettuce-plants, called Laitues 
h CcupeTj or Lettuces to Cut, which are sown thickly in 
frames, like mustard-and-cress, on hot-beds or under 
bell-glasses, and, when they have made three or four 
leaves, are cut with a sharp knife, dividing their tap- 
root, j ^st below the sur&ce of the ground. These should 



580 SALIBS. 

be dressed delicately, wiili a snfficienoj of o3 or cream, 
and a sparing allowance of other condiment. They go 
well in oompanj with other small salading, — ^as mnstard- 
and-cress, or young radish-plants in their cotyledons or 
seed-leaves. Lettaces, as an article of diet, are said to 
have a slightly anodyne or tranquillising effect on the 
system, — ^which is another recommendation of this Seed* 
ling Salad. 

Any kind of lettace-aeed, Delamer informs us, will 
serve for growing laiiues cl couper ; but green kinds are 
preferred to brown, and cabbage to cos. The Parisian 
gardeners make use of early dwarf kinds, which would 
scarcely form a heart if suffered to stand. They (as well 
as every other salad-plant) must never be stinted in their 
supply of water, if they are to retain their crispness. 
Salads that are starved, and allowed to grow slowly, are 
sure to turn out tough and ill-flavoured. Any one who 
has room enough to grow mustard-and-cress, or even 
has only a few unused mignonette-boxes, may indulge 
in seedling salad from time to time ; while, by successive 
sowings, and the employment of hot-beds, laiiues it couper 
may be had all the year round. 

When mustard-and-cress are intended to be eaten 
together, the mustard, which germinates the more quickly 
of the two, should be sown a few days later. 

Com Salady Lamb Lettucej Mdchej is valuable in 
consequence of its earliness. Sown in autumn, it affords 
supplies throughout the winter and early spring. The 
leaves are firesh-Iooking and delicate, even when taken 
from beneath the snow. Their flavour is peculiar, and 



SALADS. 581 

somewhat physickj, which does not prevent its being 
liked by many. "The French," says Evelyn, "cafl 
them salade de pritre (priest's salad), from their being 
generally eaten in Lent." 

Dress Com Salad with plenty of oil and aU the other 
nsnal condiments. It may also have a sprinkling of 
fine-chopped onion or shallot, and fine-chopped celery. 
The admixture with it of aay other small salading is a 
decided improvement. 

Water-cf^esseSy besides serving as an accompaniment 
and a garnish to many meats, are also employed as a 
genuine salad, with which it is not usual to mis any 
thing else. In this way, they are excellent during the 
autumnal months, before the frosts have touched them. 
Their best dressing is pleniy of oil, enough salt, little 
vinegar, and no mustard or pepper. Water-cress salad 
may be garnished with hard-boiled eggs cut into 
quarters, anchovy fillets in oil cut into strips, picked 
shrimps or prawns, capers, or gherkins cut into slices. 
Aromatised vinegars scarcely harmonise with the natural 
pungency of the plant. Water-cresses should be gathered, 
or grown, only in ruwmig water ; the nearer to the head 
of a spring, the better. During the first four months of 
the year they require particularly careful picking, to 
remove any spawn or parasites that may adhere to them. 
After that time, they run up to seed, and are out of 
season during the summer.

the moment it is dressed. Season the lettuce (the coa 
varieties are the best for this) with vinegar, pepper, salt^ 
and pounded sugar, all in sparing quantity. Then pour 
over it the thickest cream you can get, mix well in the-

rum. This preparation must not be made until just 
before it is wanted, as the sliced pears would turn brown 
by being made to wait. 

Orange Salad j for dessert (Franco-Algerian). Do 
not peel the oranges, but treat them in other respects 
exactly like the pears in the above receipt, with a liberal

SWEETS AND THIRD-COURSE DISHES. 

Plum Fudding, Few cooks are agreed about this old 
English dish, each one considering her own way the best* 
French cooks even go so iar as to insist that baking is 
the proper way of cooking it ; while others introdace all 
sorts of strange ingredients, not hesitating to recommend 
carrots as one of them. We have every reason to be 
satisfied with the following. 

Beat up four eggs well ; add to them, first, half a pint 
of new milk and a teaspoon of salt Then mix in half a 
pound of beef-suet, chopped very fine ; a pound of raisins, 
stoned and chopped ; a quarter of a pound of currants ; a 
quarter of a pound of brown sugar ; one nutmeg grated ; 
one ounce of candied peel, cut into thin, small strips. 
Stir all well together, and add another half-pint of new 
milk ; then beat in sufficient flour to make it a stiff paste. 
Add a glass of brandy and a glass of white Vine. Tie it 
up clos0, and boil it, if in a mould or basin, five hours ; 
if in a doth, four : but the pudding is better, as well as 
more shapely, when boiled- in a shape or moidd. 

For Simee^ make some good melted butter ; put in 
some loaf-sugar, a glass of white wine and a glass of 
brandy ; make it boil up ; pour half of it over the pud- 
ding, and serve the rest in a hot sauce-boat.

This pudding may be made with the grated crumb of 
hoDJBehold bread, as well as with flom*. It is better so, if 
to be eaten oold. 

Plum puddings may be made a fortnight or longer 
before thej are wanted, and will be all the mellower for 
the keeping, if hung up in a dry place, where they will 
not mould. 

Christmas plum pudding is often served with a sprig 
of holly stuck in the middle ; this makes a pretty garnish ; 
but, N.B., the scarlet berries of the holly zre poisonous^ 
and therefore, in spite of their very good looks, are just 
as well excluded from table. 

Plum Pudding au Vesuve^ Vesurnan Plum Puddingy 
is sure to please the youngsters, and perhaps the oldsters. 
On the top of the pudding cut out a hollow nearly as big 
as an ordinary wine-glass. Warm, in a small saucepan, 
a wine-glass or more of good cognac. Let your assist- 
ant carry this, while you carry the pudding, to the 
dining-room door. Arrived there, let her pour the 
cognac into the hollow, set light to with a strip of 
paper (not a lucifer match), open the door, and serve 
blazing. 

Carrot Pudding j A (Alexis Soyer), confessedly such,

Mix in a bowl half a pound of flour, half a pound of

a quarter of a pound of raisins stoned, a quarter of a 
pound of currants, and a quarter of a pound of sugar, 
brown or sifted white. Place these in a mould or dish ;

Carrot Puddinffy B (French). Boil in water, with 
just a little salt, a dozen fine carrots, selected as the red- 
dest to be had, and carefully scraped. When cooked^ 
pour away the water, and let them dry in the boiler by 
the side of the fire. Then take out and reject the yellow 
hearts, and squeeze the red outsides through a cullender, 
making them into a coarse purfe. 

Then make a cream or custard, in a saucepan over 
the fire, with two dessert-spoonfuls of arrowroot or corn- 
flour, and a pint of milk. When this is smooth, incorpo- 
rate it with the carrot pur^e, adding a dessert-spoonful of 
orange-fiower-water, and three-quarters of a pound of 
sugar. Then stir in, one after the other, four whole eggs ; 
and then six yolks of eggs, the whites of which you will 
set aside. Stir in well with all this a quarter of a pound 
of oiled butter. 

Three-quarters of an hour before you want to serve 
your pudding, whip the six whites of eggs to a froth, and

a quarter of a pound of pounded lump*sugar. 

Melt a good lump of butter in a stew-pan ; when it 
is quite hot, put a round of writing paper at the bottom 
of your stew-pan; upon it put your mixed ingredients. 
The butter will rise round the sides of the stew-pan, and 
prevent the pudding from sticking to them. Put the lid 
of the stew-pan on, and cover it with burning embers. 
Cook the pudding in this way, and over the fire, for half 
an hour. Turn it out topsy-turvy on the dish, and 
serve with thick, well-sweetened cream poured over it. 

Potato JPuddingj B. Boil ten or twelve fine, mealy 
potatoes, with their jackets on. When done, let them 
drain and dry ; peel them, and pound them with a lump 
of butter ; dilute this paste with milk, until you get a 
sort of batter, which is neither too thin nor too thick.

Pat the whole into a buttered monld (or this quantity 
may be divided between two), and bake in a steady

it with sugar, and set it for an instant under a glowing 
salamander. 

Almond Blancmange, Take half a pound of sweet 
almonds, and ten bitter almonds ; blanch them, and pound 
them in a mortar with a little milk. Melt a pound of 
sugar in four tumblers of milk, and in it boil the 
pounded almonds, flavouring with vanilla. Strain the 
whole through a piece of coarse muslin ; and, while the 
ingredients are stiU hot, stir into them half an oimce of 
isinglass, previously dissolved in boiling water and then 
strained. Then put the whole into a mould, which must 
remain twenty-four hours in a cold cellar, or six hours 
on ice, before turning the blancmange out of the mould. 

Boiled Rice Cahe^ with' White Wine. Binse half a 
pound of rice, and boil it gently in a little water. Before 
the rice is quite soft, take it off the fire, and drain the

Madeira, half a pint of water, six ounces of pounded 
lump-sugar, the juice of a lemon, and its rind minced 
as fine as possible. Set it on the fire again, and let it 
simmer imtil the rice is thoroughly cooked. 

Butter the inside of a mould, and rinse it sb'ghtly

Lemon Pudding ^ BoUedy B. Mix together a quarter 
of a pound of bread-crumbs, the same quantity of beef- 
suet minced very fine, the same of good powder sugar, 
ihe juice of two lemons, the peel of one shred fine, and 
ihree beat-up eggs. Put these in a mould or pudding-

sugar, a little water or cider, and the rind of a smaD 
lemon minoed to microscopic minuteness. If the season 
is advanced, or your apples are mealy and deficient in 
flavour, add the juice of the lemon. Boil these (with the 
lid on) till the apples are soft enough to be crushed with 
a fork. Crush them accordingly ; then set them aside 
to cool. 

Now line the bottom and the whole inside of your 
pie-dish (previously well buttered) with thin puff-paste. 
This pudding scorns, to be hidden beneath an oppressive 
upper crust Set your dish, so lined with puff-paste, 
into the oven, to raise the crust and cook it all but 
enough. 

Beat up well two or three eggs with a table-spoonful 
of first-rate rose-water, which will communicate a dis- 
tinguished and aristocratic flavour. Mix the beaten 
eggs with the cold cooked apple-pulp ; pour the whole 
into your pie-dish, which ought to be ftdl without over- 
flowing. Grate a little nutmeg over the surface. Bake 
it in a moderate-paced oven, neither too quick nor yet 
too slow. On taking it out, sprinkle over it a snow- 
shower of finely pounded sugar. 

This exquisite pudding ought to prove neither too 
dry, nor too juicy, nor impregnated with any too decided 
flavour. In short, it ought to be delicate and harmo- 
nious. It is nourishing, refreshing, inviting, and, above 
all, entertaining. It is equally good eaten cold as hot ; 
better, perhaps, if it can be better one way than another. 

Tradition relates that its invention is due to the 
daughter of the Druid who planted the first apple-tree

similar pnrposes. For one pound of flour, take twelve^ 
ounces of butter. Bub two ounces of this into the flour 
thoroughly* Boll it out, put in more dabs of butter ; 
dust it with flour; double it up ; roll it out again ; dab 
in more butter, and dust with more flour, till the whole 
paste is well worked up together. The more light-fingered 
and rapid the cook is in performing this, the lighter and 
more delicate the pastry will be. Slow and heavy-handed 
pastry-cooks are sure to turn o^t heavy batches of tarts 
and puflb, no matter what amount of good things they 
may put into them. 

For Sweet Paste j use the same proportions of flour 
and butter as before, with the addition of a small quantity 
of powdered loaf-sugar ; beat up two eggs thoroughly 
well, and mix with lliem a sufSciency of cold water to 
make up the paste with. The only other difference in 
this case is, that (dl the butter is rubbed into the flour 
previous to mixing, so that the paste only requires once 
rolling out. 

Paste for Standing Crust. Put three pints of cold 
water into a saucepan, to which add three pounds of 
tried-up beef-suet (Le. beef-suet that has been melted), 
and three pounds of butter, and let it remain over the 
fire till all is liquid. Pour it boiling hot into your flour, 
and make it into a stiff paste. The quantify of flour 
cannot be exactly stated in weight, as some flour will 
absorb more liquid than some other. When cool enough 
to handle, mould and shape it into the form required for 
your pasties or patls. The above is sufficient for a good-

Of this economical receipt, our lady friends re-

Baked CtisUxrd in a Saucepan^ with Bumt^Sugar 
Sauce — Flan Anglaie au CarameL Make an ordiiuuy 
custard of six eggs to a pint of milk, leaving out three 
of the whites (which will make another yeiy prettjr dish), 
and, above all things, flavour the custard. Nothing is 
so disappointing as insipid cookeiy. 

Have a small enamel-lined saucepan with a flat cover. 
Put into this a few lumps of white sugar, and very litde 
water, only sufficient to moisten the sugar. Let it be on 
the stove till it begins to assume a bright golden tinge ; 
then take it ofi^, or it will speedilj be black. In a few 
seconds, it will be a nice bright brown; then add as much 
water as it will bear. It must not taste watery, neither 
must it be syrup. Practice alone will guide you in this. 
Never mind wasting a few lumps of sugar; for yotu: 
lesson in cooking will not, even then, be very expensive. 
You must turn and twist the saucepan about, until the 
caramel (that is its name) has touched the side all round. 
Then pour in the custard, put on the lid (which you 
must strew with hot embers), and let it do gently for 
about the same time that you would bake it It will 
turn out veiy well, and is a pleasing change. It is 
eaten as often hot as cold.

to a firm firoih with some pounded sugar. When quite 
stiff, with two dessert-spoons shape this firoth into 
fneringuea or meringos (egg-shaped lumps), which you 
must place side by side over the marmalade, until you 
have covered it and completely hidden the apples. Strew 
pounded sugar very lightly over it ; put it into a quick 
oven for a few minutes, till crisp and bright yellow. 
Serve instantly ; it is good for nothing cold. If you 
have a lemon at hand, it will improve the flavour of the 
apples to put a little both of the rind and the juice into 
the marmalade.— -Zondbn Society. 

Virgtn Cream. Boil half a pint of cream in a quart

Syllabubs are best made the day before they are- 
wanted, or, at any rate, early in the morning, if they

Next day, remove the lemon-peel from the wine, and

cream, three table-spoonfrils of brandy, and the juice of' 
the two lemons ; sweeten to taste.

whisking with all your might and main till there is 
nothing more left in the bowl to whisk. Then set your 
tray, laden with syllabubs, in the coolest nook you have, 
that is free from dust, draughts, and intrusive cats. 
Syllabub-whisking is good exercise for young ladies,, 
and might be made an agreeable branch of calisthenics

Solid Syllabub. Put into a bowl three-quarters of a

peel in it, until the isinglass is quite dissolved. Then 
pour it into the bowl over the other ingredients, stirring 
well for five minutes. Then pass it through a cullender,, 
and put it into your moulds, to cool and stiiSen. 

If this syllabub is to be served in glasses, a smaller 
quantiiy of isinglass will suffice. 

SyUoibub under the Cow. Put into a large china 
bowl a good handful of sugar in lumps, over which pour

When the sugar is dissolved, take it to a cow warranted

absence of the cow), by putting the warm milk into a 
large, powerful syringe, and so squirting it violently into 
the bowl. Where there's a will, there's a way, even to 
make sub-vaccine syllabub. The French kitchen voca«- 
bulary contains no word for syllabub. 

Artificial Cream, to eat with Fruit or Fruit TarL 
Put a pint of new milk into a saucepan, add a couple of 
lumps of sugar, set it on a very slow fire, or the hot 
iron plate of a cooking-stove ; break into it the yolks of 
two new-laid eggs, and keep stirring always one way, 
tmtil it becomes as thick as ordinary cream. It must 
never reach the boiling point. 

Lemon Cream. Beat up well the whites of three eggs 
and the yolk of one ; add to them the juice of two large 



SWEETS AKD THIRD-COURSE DISHES. 609 

lemons, half a pint of water, and half a pound of loaf- 
sugar pounded fine. Mix these well together ; set them 
in a stew-pan over a gentle fire, stirring constantly the 
same way. When warm, put in the rind of one lemon, 
peeled very thin, to make it yield its volatile oil the more 
readily. When of a proper consistency, remove the 
lemon-peel, and take your cream off the fire. On no 
account may it be allowed to boil. 

Blancmange. For two pints of new milk, allow one 
pint of cream and two ounces of isinglass. Flavour 
with lemon-peel, and sweeten to your taste. Boil for 
twenty minutes, and then remove the lemon-peel. When 
nearly cold, add a wine-glass of sherry and a liqueur- 
glass of brandy, and pour into your mould to cool and 
stiffen. 

The flavour of Blancmange is open to considerable 
variation ; which is desirable for invalids, to whom it may 
be needful to offer it frequently. For this purpose, cin- 
namon, rose-water, orange-flower-water, and vanilla will 
render good service. Half a stick of vanilla will suffice ; 
and (N.B.), if washed and dried after using, it will 
serve for several times, either for blancmange, custards, 
creams, or other delicate and sweet preparations. Never- 
theless, it must be admitted that the second flavouring 
yielded by vanilla has a strong resemblance (in conse- 
quence of weakness) to the second sweetwort drawn 
from malt, and the second brewing from the gossips' tea- 
pot, when economy forbids the putting in a few more 
pinches of Hyson and Pekoe.

Mange, or Jew Mange?" is a question we once heard 
put by a host who was ignorant of the French etymology 
of those dishes, namely, that Blanc Manger meant, to 
eat something white ; and Jaune Manger^ to eat something 
yellow. There is no Blue at all, and, still more luckily, 
no Jew, to be eaten. 

Dissolve over the fire an ounce of isinglass in a pint 
of water, with the peel and juice of half a lemon. Let 
it stand aside for a while, to imbibe the flavour of the 
Lemon-peel. Then remove the lemon-peel, and stir in 
gently half a pint of white wine, and the yolks of four eggs. 
Sweeten to your taste, and pour it into moulds to cool. 

Coffee Creanu Into three pints of cream put Iwo 
dessert-spoonfuls of ground coffee and sugar, to taste. 
Boil it for half an hour ; then let it stand to settle. Pour 
off the cream from the coffee-grounds, and mix in eight 
egg-yolks, in a hot-water bath, simmering until it is of 
the consistency of thick-boiled custard. Serve in cups 
or glasses, with a ratafia or small macaroon on the top of 
each cream. 

VaniUa Cream. Boil a stick (or less) of vanilla in a 
quart of milk, until it has imbibed the perfume. Take 
it off the fire, and sweeten to your taste, removing the 
vanUla, which will serve for several times, if washed and 
laid aside to dry, supposing you are content with the 
mildest of flavours. 

Break six egg-yolks and one whole egg into a. bowl ; 
beat them up ; pour in your milk, stirring all the while, 
to mix them completely. Then thicken as before in the 
hot- water bath, and serve in the same way. 



SWEETS AND THIRD-COUBSE DISHES. 611 

Tea Cream* Pour a quart of boiling milk over 
green tea in a teapot. Put the lid on, and let it stand 
on your hot plate to infuse for a quarter of an hour. 
Then pour off the milk, mix it with a quart of good 
cream, stir in the yolks of six eggs, sweeten to taste, 
and thicken in a hot-water bath, or over a very gentle 
ifire. 

Chocolate Cream. Take half a pound of chocolate, 
•cut it into thin shavings, steep it in a little cold milk, 
-set it over the fire, and crush it smooth as it heats; then 
gradually pour in a quart of milk, stirring continually. 
Mix ten egg-yolks with half a pint of rich, sweet cream, 
stir them into your chocolate and milk, and thicken as 
before in the hot-water bath. 

Pancakesy Plain. The batter for these should be 
made three or four hours beforehand, in order to allow 
it time to rise, and insure the pancakes being light 

For a moderate quantity, break four eggs into a large 
(bowl ; add to them a tablespoonful of yeast, a teaspoon- 
'ftd of salt, a glass of brandy, and a little powdered 
cinnamon or grated nutmeg. Beat up these well to- 
gether. 

In another smaller basin mix as much flour and milk 
:a8 will bring the whole to the proper consistency of 
batter. When it is smooth, mix it with the ingredients 
in the larger bowl. Cover it with a cloth, and set it in 
a warm place to work. 

When the pancakes are fi*ied, it is better to send 
them to table, hot and hot, in small quantities, instead 
of waiting till all are done. Let them be accompanied

by pounded sugar and oranges cnt in halves, to sqneeze 
the juice over them. 

Apple Pancakes. Make the paste or batter as above, 
adding to it a few apples, peeled, cored, and chopped very 
small. These must be stirred up in the batter each time 
a pancake is taken £rom it They render the pancakes 
light and delicate ; but too much apple makes them fidl 
to pieces in the frying. 

German Pancakes. Beat half a pound of butter to 
a cream; mix with it half a pound of flour, half a pound 
of sugar, twelve egg-yolks, and a pint of lukewarm 
cream. Beat the whites of the eggs to snow, and add 
them together with a little powdered cinnamon and 
lemon-peel cut thin and chopped very fine. 

The pancakes are to be done on one side only, and 
placed in a pile one over the other, so as to form a cake, 
sugar and cinnamon being strewn between each. The 
pile to be cut downwards like a cake, and served with 
wine or jelly sauce. 

Whipped Cream. Put a quart of good cream into a 
large bowl ; mix in a basin the white of an egg with 
orange-flower or rose-water, and pounded lump-sugar. 
Stir this well into the cream, and whip with a whisk. 
As the froth rises, remove it with a ladle, and pile it on 
your dish. You may garnish it round with candied 
lemon-peel. It is eaten with cake or cooked fruit 

Some cooks use a little gum-arabic dissolved in water 
instead of the white of egg. 

Charlotte Russe^ with Cream^ Line the inside of a 
mould with sponge biscuits. Fill up the whole of the 



SWEETS AND THIRD-COURSE DISHES. 613 

interior with whipped cream (eitlier the preceding, or 
any modification of it), surround your mould with ice, 
and turn out the Charlotte just before serving. 

Charlotte of Apples (French). Butter well the 
bottom and sides of an iron mould, and line it with 
slices of jQried bread. Fill the interior with apples pre- 
pared as for apple sauce, only they may be more cooked 
and reduced in quantity, so as to make them into a sort 
of apple marmalade. The addition of a beat-up egg 
with the apple will help it to hold together better. 
Cover the marmalade with a slice of toasted bread cut 
into a shape which will close the whole completely. 
The mould should have a metal lid. Put it into the 
oven for half an hour or so, where it will brown without 
burning. Turn it out whole on a dish, and serve as it 
is. No sauce or garnishing is needed. 

Charlottes may be made in the same way, with an 
outer case of bread, containing other cooked fruit — as 
pears, apricots, gooseberries, greengages, &c. 

German Apple Pie. Boil apples cut into quarters 
in as little water as possible, with a glass of red wine, 
some sugar, and lemon-peel. When cold, put them 
into a pie -dish that has been well smeared with 
butter. 

Then stir into a little cream a spoonful of butter 
melted. Add nine eggs, a quarter of a pound of flour, 
a pint of cream, and a pound of sugar. Mix all well 
together, pour it slowly over the apples, and bake. 

Cold Cherry Dish (Gtermaii). Boil fresh, ripe 
cherries in sugar-and-water, until they fall to pieces.

Distribute amongst them, in small spoonfuls, currant 
jelly and raspberry jam. Pour over that a little boiled 
custard, by way of sauce, and cover the whole completely 
with whipped cream or syllabub froth. 

Tipsy Cake, Have an oval glass dish. Bake a 
sponge cake that will fit nicely into it in a mould the 
shape of a porcupine or other hog-shaped animal. 

Blanche a lot of sweet almonds, and split thein 
lengthwise. Stick them all over the back of the por- 
cupine, to represent quills. Set it in the dish, and pour 
round it (not over it) as much Madeira, sherry, or other 
strong white wine as it will absorb, to which some add 
brandy and rum. 

Tlie addition of custard, syllabub, or jam, is contrary 
to the traditions of the supper-table. Tipsy Cake is not 
Trifle, but something much more serious. 

BeiffnetSy Frittei'Sy are simply fruit (whole, halved, 
or in slices) dipped in batter, and fried. When well 
executed, and served hot, they make a light and elegant 
third-course dish, which is sure to be received witb 
favour. 

For the Batter^ mix two spoonfuls of oil (or oiled 
butter) with a pint of flour, a pinch of salt, and a little- 
water. Then add two egg-yolks, and gradually pour im 



SWEETS AND THIBD-COURSE DISHES. 615 

as much water as will bring the whole to the consistency 
of thick cream. Beat up the whites of the eggs to a 
frothy and add them. You may put in a dessert-spoon- 
ful of yeast ; and if you can keep the batter in a warm 
place for a couple of hours, it will be all the lighter. 

Apple Fritters. Peel the apples ; slice them across 
into rounds, from which you will remove the cores. Dip 
them in the batter, and fry to a light brown and until 
tender. Pile them regularly in the dish, and dust with 
sugar before serving. 

Oil is the best to fry them in ; but whatever fat you 
employ, it is of no use attempting Fritters unless you 
have plenty of it. 

Some steep the sliced apples in brandy before dipping 
them into the batter. 

Apricots and Peachesy halved, and Oranges^ sliced, 
are also made into Fritters, which are much admired ; 
but the peach loses flavour by cooking, while that of the 
apricot is concentrated. The orange lends itself to cook- 
ing with a very bad grace. Large Strawberries make 
delicious Fritters, but it is clear that they must have a 
deep pan of fat to be immersed in. 

Pear Fritters are cooked like Apple. 
Potato Fritters. Boast potatoes in the ashes. When 
done, put their contents in a basin, and pound them 
with a pinch of salt, a little cream and butter, and a 
glass of brandy. Mash with them a beat-up egg, till 
you get a paste thick enough to roll into balls. When 
quite cold, dip ihem in batter and fry theuL Dust with 
sugar before serving them.

HoUow Fritters still retain their old French name

Boil die rind of a lemon with a pinch of salt and a 
lamp of sugar, in a pint of water. When it has had a 
good boil up, remove the lemon-peel, and stir into it a 
pint of flour previouslj mixed with a little water. Do 
this gradually, stirring continually, and preventing the 
formation of knots. Cook your paste till it is thick 
enough for the spoon to stand upright in it The thicker 
it is, the lighter it will be. 

When you have taken it off the fire, beat up four or 
five eggs, as if for an omelette ; mix them little by little 
with the paste, and let it get cold. 

When you want to make your hollow fritters, and 
your boiling fat (in plenty) is ready, take with a spoon 
a lump of the paste as big as a walnut, and throw it into 
the fat. Put in as many as there is room to fry at once. 
When they are swollen and nicely browned, take them 
out of the fat, let them drain a minute on a hot napkin, 
and serve piled on the dish, dusted with sugar. They 
should resemble brown, opaque soap-bubbles in appear- 
ance. 

All Fritters should be served dry enough to eat with 
the fingers. 

Rhubarb affords the latest instance of the intrusion 
and establishment of strange herbage in our kitchen- 
gardens. Mr. Cuthill records that Mr. Joseph Myatt, of 
Deptford, was the first to cultivate rhubarb on a large 
scale. It is now nearly sixty years since he sent his two 



SWEETS Am> THIBD-COURSE DISHES. 617 

sons- to the Borough Market wi& Jive bunches — of which 
they could only sell three! The ixext time, thej took ten 
bunchy, all of which were sold. Coming events cast their 
shadow before; and from the small but increased sale, Mr. 
Myatt judged that rhubarb would become a favourite. 
He therefore determined to increase its cultivation, and 
year after year added to his stocL For his first dozen 
roots he was indebted to his fi'iend Mr. Oldacre, gardener 
to Sir Joseph Banks. They consisted of a kind imported 
from Bussia, finer and much earUer than the puny 
variety cultivated by the Brentwood growers for Covent 
Garden. Mr. Myatt had to contend against many pre- 
judices ; but time, that universal leveller, overcame and 
broke down every barrier, and rhubarb is no longer 
called physic. 

Indeed, the foot-stalks of the physic-plant are now 
regarded as a necessary, rather than a luxury, in culinary 
management. In the English dietary, they produce the 
same good efiPects as sorrel (their near relative) does in 
that of the French. Forced rhubarb has much less 
flavour than that grown in the usual way. In preparing 
it for 

Rhvbarb Tart^ it is not necessary to remove the out- 
side portion of the stalk. The best way is simply to wash 
and wipe it, and then cut it into pieces at least an inch 
long. By no means peel ofi^ the outer skin, by doing 
which you deprive it of the beautiful scarlet tinge which 
growers take so much pains to obtain. Invert a cup 
filled with water in the pie-dish, to help to increase and 
retain the juice. Half fill the dish with the cut rhu-

barb ; sweeten with powder sugar : put in the rest, and 
sweeten again before putting on the crust. 

N.B. The addition of a couple of table-spoonfiils of 
strawberry jam will impart to your rhubarb tart a pine- 
apple flavour. 

Khubarb is equally good in open as in covered tarts. 

The flavour of Apple Pie is heightened and improved 
by a few cloves, the rind of half a lemon, and two or 
three dessert-spoonfuls of quince marmalade. 

Marbled Jelly. This pretty dish resembles both in 
appearance and in the process of making it the very 
ornamental marble known as breccia; it consists of various 
fragments united by a cement of a different colour. It 
may be either made with the remains left after a supper- 
party, or various kinds of jelly and blancmange, or firm 
creams may be made on purpose, which may be coloured 
yellow with safiron, turmeric, or egg-yolk, green wil^ 
spinach-juice, pink with cochineal or beetroot-juice, and 
white with milk or cream. Blancmange has a very good 
effect for the veining, but any other jelly will do. 

At the bottom of your mould lay bits of various 
jellies broken up into pieces not too small. Over these^ 
pour the jelly for the veins of the marble, only just liquid. 
K too warm, it will melt the pieces and cause the jelly 
to become cloudy. It is better not to put too many 
pieces in at once, otherwise (unless very stiff indeed) 
they will fall together by their own weight, and prevent 
the liquid jelly from filtering in between them. Cool 
the jelly as rapidly as you can, and then add more 
broken-up jelly and bind it together as before, until your 



SWEETS AND THIRD-COUBSE DISHES. 61^ 

mould is quite full. These harlequin or mosaic jelliea 
admit of great variety in their composition : for instance, 
the different jellies, without heing broken up, can be 
made to lie one above the other in regular strata ; each 
jelly can have a different flavour; and the mixture of 
opaque with transparent jellies produces a veiy pleasing 
effect 

A pretty contrast is obtained by cooling jelly in a 
cylindrical mould (oval or circular), so as to leave a hoi-- 
low in the middle, to be filled up with whipped cream. 

Orange Jelly. Grate the rinds of two Seville oranges, 
two St. MichaePs ditto, and two lemons. Take the juice 
of three of each ; add half a pound of sugar and half a 
pint of water, and boil all together till it almost candies* 

Have ready a quart of jelly, made with water and a 
couple of ounces of isinglass. Add this to the orange 
syrup ; let it just boil up once, and then strain it Let 
it stand a while to settle, and then pour it into your 
moulds. 

Currant Jelly^ A. Weigh your currants, in order 
that you may allow three-quarters of a pound of loaf- 
sugar for every pound of fruit. 

Strip the currants from their stalks; boil them a 
quarter of an hour ; strain off all their juice through a 
cullender, without squeezing the fruit. Then return the 
juice to the stew-pan ; add the sugar, boil up, and skim. 
When clear, put your jelly into the glasses. 

Some boil the sugar %mth the fruit ; which occasions' 
a loss, as the skins and pips of the currants retain a good 
deal of the sugar adhering to them. 



^20 8^V££TS AND THIRD-COUBSE DISHES. 

Currant Jelly ^ B. Pick your fruit into a stone jar. 
Set the jar on the fire in a boiler of hot water. Let it 
boil until the fruit is cooked and the juice drawn. Strain 
the juice through a flannel bag into a stew-pan. Set the 
stew-pan on the fire, and skim till the juice is quite clear. 
While it is boiling, prepare your sugar (in the proportion 
of three-quarters of a pound to every pint of juice), by 
pounding it rather fine and heating it before the fire or 
in the oven. After the juice has boiled clear, take it ofiT 
the fire, and stir in the sugar until dissolved, when yon 
may pour the syrup into your pots and glasses. 

Currant Jelly^ C. — Another way. Strip your cur- 
rants into a stew-pan ; let them boil until well cooked. 
Pour them into a jelly-bag, and let them strain, taking 
care not to squeeze them. Return the juice to the stew- 
pan, and to every pint of juice put half a pound of sugar. 
Let it simmer gently, and skim. When it forms a jelly 
on the spoon, it is enough done, and you may put it in 
your pots. So managed, it will be beautifully dear. 
Next day, put brandied paper on the surface of the jelly, 
and tie down close either with paper or with wetted 
bladder. 

Orange Marmalade. Boil the rinds of six oranges 
until quite tender. Then pound half of them to a pulp, 
and cut the other half into strips or shreds. 

Dissolve a poimd and a half of loaf-sugar in a little 
of the water the orange-peels were boiled in. Carefully 
remove the white skin from the flesh of the oranges ; cut 
it in slices ; and then boil all together — orange-peel, peel- 
water and sugar, and orange-flesh — for half an hour. 



SWEETS AND THIRD-COURSE DISHES. 621 

Orange Marmalade can now be bought bo good and 
cheap, that it is not worth the trouble of making it at 
home, except in very retired or distant localities. 

Compote of Pears, Peel the pears, cover them with 
water in a stew-pan, and boil them for five hours, allow- 
ing a quarter of a pound of broken loaf-sugar for every 
pound of fruit Then put the pears in your dish .or jar. 
Beduce the juice by boiling ; add to it either a little rum, 
or kirsch-wasser, or lemon-juice, and then pour it over 
them. 

Rke Jelly. Wash a pound of rice in several cold 
waters, and in two boiling waters. Put six quarts of 
water into a large stew-pan ; add the rice, and set it on 
the fire to boil for an hour exactly. Then strain the 
whole through a sieve or coarse muslin. 

Note. The perfection of the jelly depends on the 
promptitude with which it is strained. 

Set it immediately again on the fire, with a pound of 
loaf-sugar broken small, the minced peel of a lemon, and 
its juice strained from pips and pulp. When the sugar 
is melted, throw in a glass of kirsch-wasser, and take 
the stew-pan ofi^the fire, on which it must not be allowed 
to remain after receiving the kirsch. 

Smear the inside of a mould with oil of almonds, or 
very fine olive-oil. Pour in your jelly, and let it stand 
all night to cool and stiflen. On serving, surround the jelly 
with raspberry syrup, or preserved cherries, or any other 
fruit jelly or jam. Apple marmalade also goes well with it. 

This makes an inexpensive dish, which is both pre- 
sentable and serviceable.

Cherry (or other) Tarty for Third Course or Dessert 

Have one pound of flour and one pound of butter; 
take half the butter, and work it into the whole of the 
flour (except the little you reserve for dusting with). 
'Then add the yolk of an egg, and just su£Scient water to 
knead and form it into a paste. 

Then roll it out, and stick in all over it little bits of 
butter. Dust with flour; roll it out again; fold it in 
three ; and leave it for half an hour to rise. After that, 
beat it with the rolling-pin, and stick it a second time 
full of little bits of butter. Dust, roll, fold in three 
once more, and leave it for another half-hour. 

Again beat it with the rolling-pin, and take a portion 
of it for the bottom of your tart Eoll it out, and put it 
at the bottom of a tart-pan, which should have been pre- 
viously buttered and dusted with flour. 

Take a couple of pounds of cherries of some acid 
variety (or other stone-fruit, — as plums, greengages, or 
apricots) ; cut them in halves, and remove the stalks and 



SWEETS AND THIRD-COURSE DISHES. G23 

stones. Spread them all over the tart, except round the 
edge reserved for the rim ; dust them with half a pound 
of powder sugar. With the rest of your paste form the 
rim of the tart (as lightly as possible), and the little 
strips which cross each other over the fruit. Finish off 
by varnishing the whole of the paste with a feather 
dipped in yolk of egg. Bake your tart immediately in 
a lively oven. 

Few young ladies will be so dull as not to be able to 
make a tart according to these directions. 

Cream Tart. This, like the preceding, can be made 
•of any dimensions, from the largest the door of your 
•oven will admit, down to the tartlet to place on a lady's 
plate. Phenomenal cart-wheel tarts are sometimes made, 
half cream, half fruit jam, giving them the appearance 
•of being modelled after the full moon half-eclipsed. Or 
the cream and the jam are deposited in alternate rays, 
which confers on the tart a more symmetrical look. 

The crust and fabrication of the tart are exactly as 
•described above ; only the fruit is replaced by so-called 
cream, made thus: it should be a little thicker than 
good boiled custard. Take a quart of milk ; if to be 
flavoured with vanilla, boil it in the milk. Stir in 
gradually, over the fire, four or five tablespoonfuls of 
the finest flour; sweeten to taste; remove it from the 
fire ; flavour, if not with vanilla, with orange-flower or' 
rose-water, and stir in the yolks of half a dozen eggs 
beat up. When smooth and free from lumps, your 
•cream is made. Pour it into your tart or tartlets, and 
bake them.

Cream for tarts is often nothing more tlian milk 
thickened with arrowroot, and flayouied with vanilla or 
orange-floweis. Cinnamon or nutmeg are admissible 
additions. 

Preserved Cucumbers (Sweet). Take large cncambers, 
that will quarter like citronS| and smaller ones, to be left 
whole. Pat them into a wide-monthed pot ; ponr over 
them a strong brine ; laj a cabbage-leaf on the top, to 
keep them do¥m ; tie a paper oyer the top of the pot, and 
set it in the chimnejr-eomer until the cucumbers turn 
yellow. Then set them over the fire in fresh salt-and* 
water, closely covered with a fresh cabbage-leaf over 
them. Let them heat gently, to green ihem ; but they 
must not boU. 

When they are of a good colour, take them off the 
fire ; let them stand in the liquor till cool ; then put them 
into cold water, changing it several times to take out 
the salt, previously quartering the large cucumbers and 
taking out their seeds. 

Make enough syrup to cover your fruit by putting 
a pound of sugar and an ounce of scraped ginger to 
every pint of water, with some veiy nice lemon-peel. 
Boil it to the proper thickness, and let it cooL Drain 
the cucumbers, put them into a jar, and pour the cool 
syrap over them. They require looking to a few days 
afterwards. If necessary, boil up the syrup again, and 
return it to them after cooling.

Cabinet PtuMtng. This Pudding is despised by some 
persons for the very reason which constitutes one of its 
merits in the judgment of others ; namely, that it may 
be, and often is, made with stale sponge biscuits and the 
remains of cake. It is nevertheless a very elegant, 
light, and agreeable dish, and much of it is seldom 
allowed to leave the table. 

Spot the inside of a buttered mould (not too thickly) 
with dried cherries, or, in default of them, with the best 
raisins split in halves. At the bottom put a few maca-

water^ and let it boil galloping three-qoarters of aa 
boor or an boor, according to size. A few minutes too 
long IB better tban a few minutes too little, in order to 
bave tbe pudding quite firm. 

Wben done, torn it out of tbe mould, and serve it 
with sweet sauce poured round it, made in tbe same 
way as for plum pudding, only flavoured witb tbe same 
spirit or liqueur as was used for tbe custard tbat belped 
to set tbe pudding. 

Bread-^nd'Butter Pudding. Soon done, as an im* 
promptu addition to a dinner, and almost universally 
liked. 

Take an open pie-disb of tbe size required ; butter 
its inside. 

Cut slices of veiy tbin bread-and-butter, and do not 
be afraid of tbe butter. Cover tbe bottom of tbe dish 
witb these slices, and sprinkle them witb a few well-^ 
washed currants ; it is quite a mistake to put too manjr 
currants ; it is an improvement to mix witb them just a 
few good raisiQs halved and stoned. Then put another 
layer of bread-and-butter, again sprinkling witb currants ; 
and so on, till the dish is little more than half-full, 
allowing room for the swelling of the bread. Do not 
sprinkle currants over the top layer of bread-and-butter, 
as they are apt to be dried up and uneatable; that,, 
however, is a matter of taste and judgment 

Beat up (not to a froth) three or four eggs, according- 
to tbe size of your pudding ; add to them an equal quantity 
of milk; sweeten liberaDy, and flavour with rose or

orange-flower water ; pour this over jour slices of bread- 
and-butter ; let the pudding stand a while to soak ; grate 
a little nutmeg, and sprinkle a few split raisins over the 
top. Bake in not too fierce an oven. When the surface 
is crisp and light brown, the pudding is enough. 

Baked Fruit-Batter Puddinff, Take a shallow pie- 
dish ; butter the inside. 

Make batter enough to fill it three-quarters full, in 
the following proportions : to each half-pint of milk, put 
one table-spoonful of flour, one egg, a salt-spoonful of 
salt, a teaspoonfiil of pounded sugar, and one egg over 
for the dish. * When this batter is worked smooth, pour 
it into jour disk On it drop enough fruit to cover its 
surface, plunging it into the batter, although you allow 
it to float afterwards. Scatter also a few lumps of 
butter over the surface. The batter should not be too 
deep in proportion to the quantity of fruit ; which may 
be apples, halved or quartered and cored; apricots, 
halved and with their blanched kernels added to them ; 
Orleans and other plums, damsons, cherries, &c., whole. 
Bake briskly ; send to table very hot ; and, as soon as 
taken out of the oven, dust with a liberal sprinkling of 
sifted sugar. 

Baked Batter Pudding^ Savoury ^ with Meat. Make 
the batter as before, only omitting the sugar. When 
it is poured into the buttered dish, drop into it a few 

» 

fresh sausages, or thin slices of delicate unsmoked 
bacon, or three or four cutlets of veal, pork, mutton, 
or lamb. Bake briskly, and serve instantly it is taken 
out of the oven. This and the preceding pudding can 



628 SWEETS AND THIED-COUBSE DISHES. 

be baked in an American oven before the fire. If any 
is left cold, it can be sliced and firied or ov^ied before 
the fire. 

Toad in a Hole. Make batter as before. Have a 
deep baking-dish, battered inside. In it lay a solid 
lump of meat (usuallj beef, but any batchers' meat 
will do), with a fair proportion of bone and fiit. Over 
this pour your batter, till the dish is as full as it will 
hold without spilling or boiling over. Bake till the 
meat is thoroughly done. Send up the toad to table 
still lying in its hole, but have a hot dish ready to 
receive it when removed by the person who carves. 

This is an excellent way of freshening up under- 
done remains of cold joints of meat If a little cold 
gravy be poured over it, the pudding is just as good as 
if made with firesh meat. 

Yorhahire Pudding. For the usual latch-pan under 
a roasting joint of beef, substitute a shallow, flat, tin 
dish with upright edges about three inches high. Put 
this under the meat when about half-done. When 
thoroughly hot, and a little gravy has dropped into it^ 
nearly fill it with batter made like the preceding, only 
with a smaller proportion of milL Let it roast under 
the meat before the fire. 

You may turn the pudding when browned at the top, 
in order to brown the under side ; or you may let it 
finish cooking as it is, which is much the safer plan ; 
for the richer your pudding is, the more difficult it will 
be to turn it. 

Meat may be baked over a pudding of this kind^

supported jost above it on a little three-legged or four- 
legged iron-wire framework made for the purpose. 
These unpretending dishes are wholesome, excellent, 
and almost sure to please, if served the moment thej 
are ready ; but they become heavy and greasy — spoiled, 
in short — ^if kept back for any length of time. 

Frummety^ sometimes called Firmity and Furmityj 
which always makes us think of the maid who asked 
her would-be sweetheart: "And pray what is your 
occupy-ation ?" 

Frumentum is Latin for wheat ; and the East Angli- 
ans say correctly, Frammety. 

This is usually made with wheat gleaned in the 
harvest-field ; but the truth is, that wheat is already too 
old for the purpose ; it will exercise the robustest jaws 
to eat it Coax the farmer to let you have a little wheat 
three or four days before it is fit to cut After thresh- 
ing, winnowing, and washing, boil it tender, if you can, 
in as little water as will keep it from burning. The 
gluten of the wheat will form a jelly. When done, 
take it off the fire, stir in beat-up eggs, milk or cream, 
sugar, and grated nutmeg. You may likewise flavour 
with vanilla, rose or orange-flower water. Serve either 
warm in a deep dish, or cold in custard- cups or glasses. 

Wilder Cream. Grind a quarter of a pound of well- 
roasted coffee ; pour over it ten table-spoonfuls of fresh 
milk at the boiling point. When the milk has passed 
through the coffee in the strainer, sweeten it highly. 

Make a custard with six egg-yolks, a glass of milk, 
and sugar. When it is made, and while still hot, stir 



630 SWEETS AND THIBD-GOUBSE DISHES. 

into it (over ihe fire, but without ever allowing it to 
boil) the milk which has passed through the coffee. 

Dissolve a quarter of an ounce of isinglass in a small 
quantity of boiling water ; strain it through muslin, and 
add it to the custard just before you take it off the fire. 
Meanwhile, whip up a pint of jGresh cream ; when it is 
sufficiently compact, incorporate with it the coffee- 
custard, continuing to whip all the while. Pour the 
whole into a mould, which you will set into ice an hour 
and a half before serving. Do not turn it out until you 
require it. 

This cream can be flavoured with either vanilla, 
maraschino, chocolate, cura9oa, or noyau, instead of 
coffee. If no ice is at hand, put the mould into the 
cellar, or set it in a dish of cold water, changing it for 
fresh-pumped firom time to time. In that case, it will 
be expedient to make the cream early in the morning 
(or even over-night), and to add at the same time with 
the isinglass a couple of egg-whites beaten to firoth or 
snow. 

Colonial Cream — of Coffee, Chocolate, Yanilla, and 
Caramel. Boil a quarter of a pound of high-coloured, 
fresh-ground coffee in a quart of milk, aromatised with 
vanilla, together with two dessert-spoonfiils of not too 
bro^n caramel. Take it off the fire, strain it, and stir 
in six egg-yolks. 

Boil a tumbler of water, and into it throw as much 
pulverised chocolate as would make three cups. Keep 
stirring until it is melted and smooth; a very short 
boiling up suffices. Take it off the fire, combine it with 



SWEETS AND THIBD-COURSE DISHES. 631 

the cream already prepared, and finish it off in the hot- 
water batL 

This cream is served in cups or glasses. It may be 
simplified by omitting either the coffee or the chocolate. 
It may also be put into a mould and iced. 

Many housekeepers avoid attempting dishes prepared 
in moulds, because they exaggerate the difficuliy of 
making them, and especially of turning them out of 
the mould. But nothing is easier. Jellies and the like, 
served in flat dishes or glasses, are considered quite the 
infancy of the art, to be handed over to third-class 
tables. When, without any considerable increase of 
•expense, it is possible to increase the elegance of a 
table, it would be inexcusable to neglect the advantage 
for the sake of avoiding a little trouble. 
^ The best moulds are those made of tinned iron ; not 
•only are they less expensive than copper moulds, but 
there is no danger of poisonous results from pouring in 
hot ingredients to be left there to cool for a certain length 
of time. 

The turning out is readily effected by twisting round 
the mould for a few seconds a towel dipped in boiling 
water. The contents should not be shaken to separate 
them firom the mould, as is generally done with cakes 
and pastry. Place the dish upon the mould, and reverse 
them, keeping the two in close contact; then lift the 
mould, leaving what it contained in its place on the 
'dish.

BEVERAGES. 

The portion of our aliment T^hich most requires Eveij 
Man to be his own Physician, is probably that which we 
take in a liquid form; namely, what we drink. In 
eating (except in the case of excessively brutal or dis- 
eased appetite), there arrives a moment when nature 
says unmistakably, ^^ Enough I It is now time to say 
Grace after Meals. Let us thank a Bountifiil Provi- 
dence for what we have received !'* 

Not so with beverages. There is no beverage, not even 
water, which we may not contract the habit of sipping in 
quantities greater than the bodily frame requires. There 
may be intemperance with diluents as well as with stimu- 
lants, bringing on dropsy instead of delirium tremens. 

The good effects of fermented drinks in moderation 
are incontestable. We are induced to take them by a 
sort of instinct. It onffht to be as easy for a man to 
know when he has had enough beer or wine, as to know 
when he has had enough solid food ; such, however, is 
not universally the case. A perfectiy healthy stomach, 
governed by a perfectiy self-controlling mind, will mea- 
sure the limit with decisive pnidence; nevertheless, 
wine, from the earliest antiquity, has lured its lovers 
into occasional excess. Such excess should not be 



BEVERAGES. 633 

blamed with ultra-severitj, when it is only occasional. 
Accidents will happen. Deep sorrow is dry. Fatigae 
cannot always exactly estimate how little it needs to re- 
store its strength. There are times and seasons when fer- 
mented liquor lays hold of us sooner than it does at others. 
Some particular taps or bins have a peculiar quality of 
getting home speedily. Any of these causes may take a 
man by surprise, make him go further than he intended, 
and astonish him when he finds how far he has gone. 

Wine was drunk for ages after ages without the 
drinkers once suspecting that it was possible to extract 
the spiritaouB portion which gives it its strength; but 
the Arabs having taught us the art of distillation (which 
they invented to obtain the perfume of flowers, of the 
rose especially), it was thought possible to discover the ' 
special element which gives to wine its peculiar flavour, 
and enables it to produce such singular eflects. After 
successive experiments, there came forth, at last, alcohol, 
spirit of wine, brandy (the king of strong drinks), ex- 
citing the sense of taste to its highest pitch. 

The difierent combinations of alcohol have opened, in 
liqueurs, a new source of pleasure, and, in elixirs, have en- 
dowed drugs with an energy and concentration unknown 
before their union with this agent. They have supplied 
settlers in savage countries with a formidable weapon ; 
for the natives of Australia and the New World have been 
destroyed at least as much by fire-water as by fire-arms. 

Spirits nevertheless render invaluable service in cases 
of extreme urgency, such as excessive loss of blood, 
extreme fatigue, or sudden and overwhelming mental

•emotion. In these cases, ihejr must be administered by 
<X)mpetent bystanders; no person should ventore to 
prescribe them to himself. But the main value of 
strong drinks, as remedial potions, lies in the prompt'^ 
ness of their effects. They are absorbed into the system 
with extreme &cility; they go to work witboat tibe 
least delay ; and the relief they afford is all bnt instan- 
taneous. Supply a man, worn oat with &tigue, with 
food of a substantial nature ; he will scarcely be able to 
«at it, and, for a while, will feel little the better for it 
Give him a glass of wine or a thimbleful of brandy, 
imd in a couple of minutes he will be a different man. 

In cases of great weariness, a capital restorative is a 
plateful of good, hot soup, with either a glass of wine or 
a table-spoonful of brandy stirred into it 

Natural thirst is merely the instinct which urges us 
to maintain the equilibrium between the transpiration 
from our bodies (sensible or insensible) and the fluid 
needed to supply the loss. It is clear that this will be 
greatly modified by the degree of dryness of the atmo- 
sphere, the temperature of the season, the exercise taken, 
and the labour performed; No rule can be laid down, 
no allowance meted out, imder conditions so changeable 
in their nature. Healthy feelings and common sense 
can alone bo relied upon as competent guides. Artificial 
or adventitious thirst (which is peculiar to the human 
race) is the craving which drives us to seek in drink a 
strength which is not naturally our own. The gratifi- 
cation of this kind of thirst is a factitious indulgence, 
rather than a natural want ; for it is really inextinguiah- 



BEVERAGES. 635 

able. The liquids taken to assuage it, only excite the 
craving, by adding fuel to fire. This thirst, become 
habitual (its certain destiny), is the generator of all the 
drunkards in the world. They cease to drink, either 
when there is no more liquor, or when the liquor 
drunk has made ihem incapable of drinking more. 

This thirst goes on, and on, increasing ; it becomes 
80 intense and habitual, that the sufFerer cannot pass the 
night without drinking, but must rise from his bed, a 
slave to the dram ; until, at last, it reaches its climax, 
which climax is no other than — Death. 

" I have attentively observed the workmen who come 
to us," said a Dantzic spirit-shopkeeper to BriUat 
Savarin ; " and when they once give way to a passion 
for strong drink, they all reach their end in exactly the 
same way. 

^^ At first, they only take their dram in the morning ; 
and this quantity suffices during several years. More- 
over, the habit is common to all our work-people; a 
man who did 'not take his morning dram would be 
shunned by his fellows. Then, they double the dose; 
that is, they take a dram in the morning and another at 
noon. They continue this allowance for two or three 
years. Then they take it morning, noon, and night. 
Soon, they must have their dram at every hour of the 
day, and they refuse all spirit not seasoned with spice. 
When they are come to that, they have not more than 
six months to live, at the very outside. They dry up to 
skeletons; fever seizes them; they are taken to the 
hospital ; and are seen no more." 



636 BKVEBAGES. 

After a long walk, fatigue, or strong exercise, or 
any other exciting cause of thirst, whatever the heverage 
with which you quench it, first rinse the mouth, either 
with water or the beverage itself. 

That pure (or rather unmixed) water is in sucli cases 
an unwholesome drink, is a popular beUef, confirmed bj 
many striking instances. Wliy it should be so, is rather 
mysterious ; u e. the cause is not kno^vn with certainty. 
That it contains the germs of intestinal parasites may be 
true in many cases, but far from in all. 

To Cool Drinksy in SuUry Weather, Wine or other 
beverages may be agreeably cooled in summer by first 
pumping five or six pails of water out of a deep welL 
Make use of the seventh or eighth pailful to plunge in it 
the bottle containing the drink to be cooled, half an hour 
before it is required. 

When that resource is not at hand, wrap the bottle in 
coarse rag or matting, dip it in the coolest water you 
have, and hang it in a current of air. If you hare no 
draught or current, hang it in the shade at the end 
of a long string, and make it swing backwards and 
forwards. The more rapidly the evaporation of the 
moisture in the rag takes place, the more efiectual will 
be the cooling. 

Intense cold may be obtained by mixing together salt 
and pounded ice or snow. A moderate degree of cold is 
produced by the dissolution of common salt in water; 
still stronger cold is to be had by dissolving powdered 
nitre in water. In both these cases, the cold is the 
result of the change in the state of aggregation of the 



BEVERAGES. 637 

atoms composing the salt and the water, or the nitre and 
the water, consequent upon their admixture.* 

In Bengal, where ice is never formed naturally, it is 
artificiallj produced bj the following means. Shallow 
pits are dug, which are partially filled with straw ; and 
on the straw, flat pans containing water are exposed by 
night to the dear firmament The water is a powerful 
radiant, and sends off its heat copiously into space. The 
heat thus lost cannot be supplied firom the earth — ^this 
source being cut off by the non-conducting straw. 
Before sunrise, a cake of ice is formed in each vessel. 

It appears that the condition most suitable for the 
formation of ice in this way is not only a clear air, but 
a dry air. The nights, says Sir Robert Barker, most 
favom*able for the production of ice, are those which are 
clearest and most serene, and tn xxihich very little dew 
appears after midnight. To produce the ice in abundance, 
the atmosphere must not only be clear, but it must be com- 
paratively free from aqueous vapour. When the straw in 
which the pans are laid becomes wet, it must be changed 
for dry straw ; the reason, according to Professor Tyn- 
dall, being, that the vapour rising from the wet straw, 
and overspreading the pans like a screen, would check 
the chill and retard the congelation. 



1. DILUENTS AND STIMULANTS. 

Toast-and-Water. Have ready the jug (with a cover 

* See Tyndall's admirable work. Heat considered as a Mode of 
Motion, 



638 BEVERAGES. 

to it) in which your toast-and-water is to be made, and 
another jog of somewhat larger dimensions. Boil the 
water in a kettle, and pour it into the larger jng. While 
it is standing a minute or two to settle, toast a diy crust 
of bread, and allow some portion of it to catch fire and 
blaze. Blow out the flame immediately ; put the charred 
bread into the smaller jug, and over it pour the hot 
water from the other jug. Put on the lid, and let it 
stand to cool. The bread may be left in it as long as 
any fit for use remains. If wanted in a hurry, the 
cooling may be hastened by plunging the jug in a pan of 
cold spring water. 

J£ the toast-and-water is required to appear in de- 
canters, as ^^ President's Sherry," it should be poured away 
from the bread as soon as it has taken sufficient colour. 

Some tell you not to let the bread catch fire,* but it. 
is well-known that an excellent plan of purifying water 

* ^ Toast bread slowly, without burning. The usual method of 
burning bread for toast-water is as absurd as burning coffee to a coal, 
instead of browning it chestnut colour ; and there is as much difference 
in the toast-coffee, well prepared or not, as in a good or indifferent cup 
of coffee. All dishes cooked for the sick should be prepared as nicely 
as possible, and served with taste." — Mrs. E. F. Haskell. 

''The idea that bread must be burnt black to make toast-and-water 
is quite a popular delusion, for nothing nourishing could come from 
it : if jour house was burnt to ashes, it would be valueless ; and the 
same with burnt bread, which merely makes the water black ; but the 
nutriment of the bread, intended to relieve the chest, has evaporated in 
smoke by being burnt*' — Alexis Soyer. 

The above opinions are founded on the notion that invalids drink 
toast-and-water for the sake of the nutriment it contains ; in which 
case, they had better take ox-tail soup. But when we remember that 
a mild diluent is what is wanted, the mode of preparing it assumes a 
different aspect. 



BEYEBAQES* 639* 

is to stir into it a little pounded charcoal. Bread 
charcoal, for that purpose, is as efficient as wood char- 
coal ; and an invalid will be glad to have his drinking 
water purified as well as softened. 

To avoid too high colouring, this drink may be made 
with a large piece of toasted bread and a small bit of 
burnt crust. 

Barley Water* Put a teacupiul of pearl barley 
into a quart of very pure, cold, soft water ; when it boils 
up, skim carefully, and let it continue boiling for at 
least half an hour. Then strain off the water from the 
barley, and let it cool. 

Some sweeten barley water, and flavour it with the 
peel or juice of lemon ; but it is usually administered 
pure and simple. 

The same barley may be boiled again twice or thrice. 

Lemonade. Peel a lemon very thinly, cut the flesh 
in slices, and put the whole into a jar with a few lumps 
of sugar. Pour over them a quart of boiling water, 
and let them stand covered until cold. 

Orangeade is made in the same way, substituting 
orange for lemon. Very useful for affording a variely 
in the beverages of feverish patients. 

Syrup^ for making Lemonade immediately. In a pint 
of water, boil a pound and a half of lump-sugar. Throw 
in half an ounce of tartaric acid ; when cold, flavour 
with essence of lemon, and put it inunediately into bottle. 
A table-spoonful of this stirred up in a tumbler of cold 
spring water makes a refireshlng draught without the 
least delay.

Raspberry Vinegary A To be added to water as a 
cooling draught in summer, or to quench feverish thirst 

Put a pound of raspberries into a bowl, and crush 
them well with a wooden spoon ; pour over and mix 
with them a quart of the best white- wine vinegar. 

Next datfy strain the liquor over another pound of 
fresh raspberries ; next day, do the same ; but in these 
two last cases do not squeeze the fruit, only drain the 
liquor away as completely as you can. Then bottle 
your Raspberry Vinegar, and set it aside for fiiture use. 
Small bottles or pliials (containing about half a pint) 
are the most convenient, in order to have the vinegar 
fresh and fresh, instead of letting it get flat by standing 
long in a large bottle that has been opened. 

Raspberry Vinegar j B. Put a good quantity of 
raspberries into a stone jar, and cover them with white- 
wine vinegar. After standing, well covered, nine or ten 
days, squeeze and strain through a jelly-bag. To the 
juice add an equal weight of lump-sugar pounded. Set 
it on the fire, and keep stirring until the sugar is tho- 
roughly dissolved. Do not let it boil, for fear of its 
becoming too thick; but skim well, and when nearly 
cold, pour off into bottles. Cork weU, and keep in a cool 
place to avoid fermentation. 

Other agreeable fruit vinegars may be made with 
strawberries, currants, cherries, &c. 

Apple Drink Into a couple of quarts of boiling 
water throw two table-spoonfrds of rice and half a dozen 
apples, peeled, cored, and sliced. Boil an hour ; then 
pass the liquor through a cullender, pressing the rice 



BEYBRAQES. 641 

and apples with a spoon, but not squeezing them through. 
This may be sweetened if the patient desires it, but it 
allays thirst better without any sugar. 

Sherbet. Put into a large bowl one pound of loaf- 
sugar and the juice and rinds of three lemons. Pour 
over them a quart of boiling water, and let them stand 
all night. 

Next day, strain the liquor through a doth ; add to 
it five bottles of currant wine, and one of rum. Mix all 
well together, and bottle off for use. 

When wanted, mix with cold spring water in a 
tumbler. 

Seltzer Watery Home-made, Have ready a bottle 
with a metallic capsule, which you have proved to fit 
hermetically close. Fill the bottle with pure spring 
water up to the neck ; throw into it a dram of tartaric 
acid and a dram of bicarbonate of soda, both in powder. 
Screw on the capsule as promptly as you can. In a 
quarter of an hour it is fit for use. It may be drunk 
unmixed, as soda water, and is also greatly relished in 
summer, if poured into a tumbler with a few teaspoon- 
fuls of syrup or a glass of wine at the bottom. 

Ginger Beer, or Pop, A. Take three-quarters of an 
ounce of bruised (not grated) ginger, one lemon cut 
across into very thin slices, one ounce of cream of tartar, 
and one ounce of loaf-sugar cut into lumps. 

Pour over the above one gallon of boiling water, 
and when cooled down so as to be merely tepid, add two 
table-spoonfiils of good yeast 

Let it work for four hours ; then strain it through 

TT 



642 BEVERAGES. 

a coarse linen bag. Allow it four hours more to settle ; 
then bottle it, tying down the corks with string. Laj 
down the bottles on their sides, and it will be fit for use 
in ihree or fonr days. 

Ginger Popy B. Pat into a tub or earthen pot two 
pounds of loaf-sugar, two ounces of cream of tartar, two 
ounces of best giioger bruised, and two lemons cut into 
slices. Pour over them three gallons of boiling water ; 
when lukewarm, toast a crust of bread, spread it thicklj 
with yeast, and put it into the liquor ; mix with it also 
the whites of two eggs and their crushed shells. Let all 
stand till next morning, and then strain and bottle your 
Pop. 

Beer from Sugar and Hops. The cask should be 
placed on end, as for cider, with a hole bored in the 
centre of the top large enough to hold a large stone- 
bottle cork. For a ten-gallon cask, boil one pound and 
a half of the best hops in eleven gallons of boiling water 
for ten minutes or a quarter of an hour. Then strain 
the liquor upon fourteen pounds of brown sugar, and 
mix in with it a pint of good new yeast of the best 
quality. Pour the whole into the cask, and it.will soon 
begin to ferment. The yeast being retained on the top 
of the vessel by means of the external rim, will, for 
the most part, fall and dissolve into a liquid shape, and 
run back into the cask through the central hole. In 
summer, it will reqtiire three weeks or a month to com- 
plete the fermentation. For the last fortnight, the cork 
may generally be kept in the hole, but should be taken 
out every two days to give vent to the fixed air, and 



BEYSBAOKS* 643 

then replaced* The cork may then be stuck in per- 
manently, and in four days it will be fit for draught or 
bottling. 

May Ihink (German). This delicious beverage is 
limited to the season when the shoots of the Woodruff 
{Aspervia odorata) are firesh and tender — say from the 
middle of April till the middle of June, according to 
dimate and situation. For earlier use, planta may be 
forced in a hot-bed ; but their perfume will be inferior 
to that of those grown naturally. 

Put into a tankard — or into a large covered glass 
made for the purpose— a small bunch of woodruff, a few 
lumps of sugar, and two or three slices of lemon, or 
orange, or both. Then fill up with common, weak, 
white wine; the poorest and thinnest Bhine wine is 
the proper thing to use. If not to be had, Sauteme, 
Yin de Grave, or the white wines of the Touraine, as 
Beaugenoy, may be used; but they should be diluted 
with water, if a hearfy draugM is to be indulged in. In 
moderation, it is a most strengthening drink for con- 
valescents. Half red Rhine wine and half white may 
be employed. Cider, with a glass of sherry or Madeira 
in it, makes not a bad imitation. 

Let all steep, in a very cool place, a few hours, or 
, even all night, with the cover down, and serve with the 
things floating in it. 

Malt Wvne (Ten GhJlons), A. Make a strong sweet- 
wort, thus : 

Mash one bushel of malt with nine gallons of water, 
and then boil it three-quarters of an hour with three- 



644 BEVERAGES. 

quarters of a pound of hops. The Jlrst wort of this is to 
be used for the wine ; the second will make yon some 
nice small beer. 

Boil twenty-four pounds of loaf-sugar in eight gal- 
lons of water for half an hour, skimming well. Pat it 
into a tub, and when milk-warm, add two gallons of die 
above sweet-wort, the fermentation of which should 
have commenced. 

In three days, put it into a cask, and fill it up daily 
until it ceases to ferment Then draw off a sufficient 
quantity to allow space in the cask for the foUowing 
articles: Four pounds of good raisins chopped, one 
pound of brown sugar-candy, one ounce of isinglass, 
and a quarter of a pound of bitter almonds. 

The addition of these generally causes a second 
fermentation; the bung, therefore, must only lie light 
over the hole until it subsides, when you will add a 
quart of brandy, and then stop the bung down dose. 

This wine should be kept for two years before it is 
drunk. 

Malt Wine (Six Oallons), B. Pour twelve quarts 
of boiling water over eighteen pounds of lump-sugar. 
When cold, add to it six quarts of good sweet-wort or 
tun. Mix them well, and put them into the cask with 
one pound of best raisins chopped small, half an ounce 
of isinglass, and a pint of brandy. Let it work itself 
dear, and then put it into bottles. 

Ginger Wine. Take four gallons of spring water, 
three pounds of lump-sugar, ten ounces of ginger, and 
the rind of eight lemons. Boil these together half an

the decoction into the cask, with the juice of the eight 
lemons, one pound of chopped raisins, and a little yeast. 
Let it work for about six days, filling it up and stirring 
it from the bottom. Put in a pint and a half of brandy, 
and a little isinglass. Close it up with the bung, and 
let it stand three or four weeks before bottling, when 
you will put a little brandy at the bottom of each 
bottle. The beginning of March is the best time to 
make it. 

Grape Wine. Pick the grapes off the stalks, measure 
their quantity, and then bruise or crush them well. Add 
to them the same quantity of spring water as there 
was of uncrushed grapes. Let it stand eight-and-forty 
hours; then strain it, and to eyery gallon put four 
pounds of loaf-sugar. Put it into the cask, and when 
a little settled after fermentation, enrich it with brandy, 
and a few of the best raisins cut in halves. 

We would further suggest that the stalks of the 
grapes be also steeped together with the fruit Some 
of the elements which render wine restorative are 
derived from the stalks of the bunches of grapes. 

White- Currant Wine, Measure your fruit; broise 
it well, stalks and all ; to every peck of finiit allow five 
quarts of water. Stir up the fruit and the water to- 
gether, and let them stand steeping for twelve hours. 
Then squeeze and strain it ofi^, and to every gallon of 
juice add three and a half pounds of sugar. When the 
sugar is completely dissolved, put it in the cask, and set 
it to work.

Parsnip Wine.* To three pounds of sliced parsnips 
put one gallon of water. Boil them till qtute soft, then 
strain the liquor away. Add to it three pounds of sugar ; 
boil up again, removing the scum as it rises, and then 
treat like other home-made wines. 

Orange Wine, To each gallon of water allow 
three and a half pounds of loaf-sugar. Boil them 
together, and take off the scum. When cold, add (for 
each gallon of water) the juice of twelve or fourteen 
oranges, and one-third of the peel cut lliin. Let it 
stand so for four-and-tweniy hours. Then work it 
with a toast spread with yeast Let it stand for two 
days, and take out the peel before putting it into the 
cask. 

Some housekeeper consider the addition of a few 
lemons a great improvement. 

Raisin Wine. Allow one gallon of water to every 
six pounds of chopped raisins. First, put half that 
quantity of water to the firuit, and let it stand for ten 
days, stirring it every day; then strain it o£ Then 
put the other half of the water to the raisins, and let it 
stand another ten days. Strain it off, and tun the two 
liquors together. 

You will have to draw off the wine two or three 
times before it is fit to bottle. March is the best time 
of year to make it

A ghastly anecdote, illustratiye of the deep sincerity of dinner- 
friendships, and the profound attachment whereof boon companions 
are capable, long suiriyed the miserable Fauntleroy, and was, within 
these twenty years, told for truth by one of his generation. 

His elegant dinners had been particularly renowned for some re- 
markable and unmatchable Cura^oa. He had been frequently asked at 
his own table of whom he bought it, but always kept the secret. When 
he was ordered for execution, three friends, bound to him by the 
remembrance of many feasts and many glasses of this famous liqueur, 
had a parting intenriew with him in his condemned ceU. They had 
discharged themselres of such edifying remarks as they had brought 
with them, and had taken their final leave of him, and were about to 
retire, when the most impressive of the three stepped back, and said, 

" Fauntleroy, you stand on the verge of the tomb, and Eternity 
awaits you. We brought nothing into this world, and it is certain 
we can take nothing out At so supreme a moment, have you any 
objection to say how and of whom you procured that Curafoa ?"— OU

N.B. In making any similar liqueurs, note that 
the syrup or sugar is not to be added until afier the 
flavouring ingredients have been withdrawn. Other- 
wise, thei/ would absorb their share of sugar, which, 
consequently, would be wasted. 

Cassia — Black" Currant Liqueur; a great favourite. 
Does this derive its name from the little French seaport 
on the Mediterranean coast ? The skins only of the 
black currants are used; and exemplary housewives 
have the patience to squeeze out the pulp from the 
currants, one by one, between their finger and thumb. 

Steep a pint of the skins in a quart of rectified spirit 
for a fortnight in a warm place. Then strain the liqueur 
from the skins, and add to it a pound and a half of sugar. 

Angelica Liqueur^ reputed highly stomachic Use 
the same proportions of sugar and spirit, after infusing

Pleasant Cure for an Unpleasant Complaint. Boil a 
pint of good, firesh milk. Beat (not firoth) an egg until 
it has become as liquid as you can make it Pour it 
slowly into the milk, stirring gently all the while. 
When well mixed, add three lumps of sugar. If it be a 
ffrovm person who has caught the Bad Cold, throw in a 
wine-glassfiil of rum ; for young people, the dose must 
be proportionally less. Swallow this cordial hot at bed- 
time, or, better still, after going to bed. Its efiects are 
so agreeable and comforting, that the only fear is, 
having taken it once, you will catch another bad cold at 
the first opportunity, to afford you a pretext for taking 
it again. 

Sherry Cobbler (American). Take a glass one- 
half full of sherry wine ; sweeten, and fill with fine ice. 
Suck it through a straw or slender glass tube, to prolong

substances, and pass the whole through a funnel im- 
perfectly plugged with a bunch of lavender, marjoram, 
thyme, wormwood, sage, and other aromatic and in- 
noxious plants. This drink is cheap, and eminently 
wholesome for haymakers, harvestmen, and others, who 
have to work in summer exposed to the sun. 

Lemon or Vinegar Wliey. Instead of adding wine to 
the sugared milk, use sufficient lemon-juice or vinegar 
to form a curd. Boil up, and strain clear. This drink 
is less heating than white-wine whey.

2. HERB-DRINKS AND TISANES. 

There is a branch of the culinary art, once cultivated 
by our housewives in the olden time, which is too much 
neglected by the modem English, though our neighbours 
on the Continent avail themselves of its aid whenever need 



652 BEVERAGES. 

requires. In our Cookery for the Sick, we have a great 
variety of nice little tempting dishes of the solid and 
nntritions class; soch as pnddings, jellies, and blanc- 
manges, besides eggs and farinaceons food under various 
aspects : bat we are limited in our resources as to liquid 
preparations. 

Those which we make nowadays are mostly too 
good for invalids. Strong beef-tea and concentrated 
mutton-broth are more fitted to feed any internal fire 
than to quench it Sick men's soups, with us, are 
hardly diluent enough to drench and wash away a 
tenacious indisposition, and to sweep it before it by a 
deluge of draughts. Our real English soups — ^mock- 
turtle, ox-tail, or giblet — are meat, drink, and vinous 
refireshment, all in one; and excellent they are for 
men in robust health, taking strong exerdse; but we 
really are deficient in those mild, yet not utterly limpid 
and simple, beverages, which inundate the bodily system, 
as the Nile ovelrfiows its valley, drowning many a noxious 
intruder, and leaving behind it a decidedly beneficial 
infiuence. 

Herb Drinksj or Tisanes (more learnedly spelt 
Ptisanesj being derived from imaavfi^ husked and 
pounded barley, and also the barley water prepared firom 
the same), are a class of domestic medicines always 
made at home. Of all the forms of taking physic^ 
Tisanes are the most largely employed in France. 
Without consulting the doctor, and by a sort of instinct^ 
people have recourse to them at the slightest indisposition. 
Often they form the only treatment. Professional men 



BEVERAGES. 653 

prescribe them always, either on account of the real 
service they render, or in obedience to the public opinion 
touching their utiliiy, or simply to quiet the sick man^s 
mind. Even when useless, they amuse the patient 
with the semblance of a serious treatment; they gain 
time, and allow the healing power of nature to work 
unchecked by the grosser diet which they replace for 
the time. 

Sick people mostly crave for something to take to do 
them good ; they are hard to be persuaded that, in many 
cases, nature alone will effect their cure. It is a matter 
of importance to humour them ; and herb-drinks step in 
to fill the gap (playing the part of proxy to active drugs) 
in the shape of a harmless beverage. Their utility is so 
universally recognised, that recourse is had to them at 
the first symptom of indisposition, whether in conse- 
quence of thirst and heat felt by the patient, or in 
deference to wide-spread and traditional notions. The 
addition of a considerable quantity of liquid absorbed and 
carried into the circulation, and brought into contact 
with the different tissues, has actually real advantages in 
the majority of cases. The benefit derived from Tisanes, 
whose use is the result of the sick man's longing, is fiilly 
proved by experience. They comprise the whole pharma- 
ceutical machinery necessary to set going, in order to 
obtain the multitude of cures which, with Tisanes' 
humble aid, nature alone suffices to effect 

It may be boldly stated that more than half the 
illnesses (not fatal) suffered in France are brought to a 
happy issue by the sole employment of an appropriate 



654 BEYEBAGES. 

herb-drink; and, in those illnesses in which more 
decided means are obliged to be employed, the herb- 
drink comes in for its full share of credit. A maladj to 
be treated without Tisane scarcely enters into Fr^ich 
ideas of general therapeutics, unless in certain local 
affections, or in a few external and inconsiderable lesions. 
Many a patient attributes his recovery to the herb or the 
blossom of which his drink is made, who would haye 
been thrown into great depression and perplexity by 
advising him to abstain from Tisane, and to trust to the 
unassisted vital energies of his own constitution. 

Tisanes, then, are liquids which contain in dissolution 
a certain quantity of medicinal principles, and which are 
intended to serve as the habitual beverage of sick 
persons. Tisanes may be grouped into several distinct 
classes in respect to the elements which ihey hold in 
suspension. The selection of the class to be administered 
to different patients, or to the same patient at different 
stages of his complaint, must rest with the medical 
attendant, or with the whim or inclination felt by the 
invalid, and the faith he places in its curative powers. 
Many valetadinarians have their fevourite herb^rink 
which, and no other, they firmly believe will restore them 
to their wonted health. 

Herb-drinks, too, are subject to the fashion of the 
day. They have their riise and fall, like gigot-sleeves, 
short waists, crinoline, and mustard-seed. A long- 
lived physician will have seen the reign and the 
decadence of toast-and-water, chicken broth, ground-ivy 
tea, and many others. Tisanes, also, have local reputa* 



BEVERAGES. 655 

tions. In England, in Sydenham's time, small beer 
was in vogne; monntainons ootmtries generally patronise 
buttermilk and whey ; the Spaniards pnt their tmst in 
cacao. Yery weak tea, made by boiling a mere pinch in 
a tea-kettle, is fast rising in Continental esteem. 

As the amount of active or nutritive principle con* 
tained in Tisanes is exceedingly small in proportion to 
their bulk, they approach homoeopathic remedies in one 
respect. Begarding them in another light, they act by 
a sort of moral power or psychical force, through the 
implicit confidence placed in them by a numerous body 
of patients ; while the quantity of fluid they contain has 
an tmdeniable influence, especially when taken warm, in 
promoting perspiration and other aqueous discharges- 
from the human frame. With this very object in view^ 
they are always concocted to be as agreeable to the taste 
and as light to the stomach as possible. 

There is, however, a Purgative Tisane which ought 
to be banished from the realms of medical art, in conse- 
quence of its sinning against this very rule, although it 
is known by the stylo of Royal Tisane. We can under- 
stand the wish to prolong agreeable sensations, and the 
desire to have a neck as long as a crane's when 
a man has epicurean delicacies set before him; but 
it seems a wanton Belf-tortnre to expose one's gas- 
tatory organs to the slow passage over them of a pint or 
more of liquid highly flavoured with senna, liquorice, 
gayac, rhubarb, sarsaparilla, squills, coriander, and 
lemon-juice. We are perfectly content to cede the 
royal draught to those who have the right divine to quaff 



656 BEVEBAGE& 

it, and to content ourselves with the same ingredients 
swallowed nnder a plebeian pilnlar form. 

The true way of effecting a tisane-care of the nume- 
rous small ailments which few people die of, but which 
ixte ailments and annoyances nevertheless, is to do as 
you would in a case of water-cure, of grape-cure, or any 
other regimen in vogue, viz. adhere strictly to your orders, 
and be true to your flag. You must swallow no other drink 
but Tisane so long as you are seeking restoration through 
its aid ; and certainly some effect— often beneficial — ^must 
be produced on the frame by a complete abstinence for a 
week or ten days from strong tea or coffee, in repeated 
cupsful; from porter, by the pot; from pale ale and 
Guinness, in reiterated pints ; from bottles of brown 
sherry, and the same of port ; fit)m whets and drams, 
and sips of liquor innumerable ; from double and triple 
nightcaps of hot brandy -and -water, mm-punch, or 
whisky -toddy ; not to mention American cooling 
draughts, such as cobblers and juleps, taken during the 
course of the day, which count for nothing in the con- 
sumer's estimate. 

From all these incendiaries the stomach is assured, as 
long as the Tisane policy is taken up. The first effect 
may be a slight lassitude and a lackadaisical sort of 
feeling ; but afl^erwards comes activity of the perceptive 
powers, combined with lightness and fi^hness of the 
bodily feelings, till an increased appetite and a longing 
for the individual's usual diet shows that Tisane has done 
its duty, and that the patient may be his usual self again, 
provided always that his original and every-day self do not 



BSVXRAOES. 657 

indulge in habits of such excess that long continuance in 
them is impossible to mortal man. 

Of course, no inyalid on the verge of delirium tremens y 
or within it, can suddenly renounce his stimulant and 
confine himself to Tisane without running a risk ; but 
medical men can prescribe the amount of stimulant or 
sedatiye to be taken medicinally during a course of 
Tisane, as they can the administration of any other drug 
that may be specially required. Moreover, when once a 
man is fairly attacked by delirium tremens^ the best thing 
he can do is — ^we mean, the best thing he could have 
done would have been — ^to avoid the causes of delirium 
tremens* 

Tisanes are easily prepared by travellers on land ; for 
several of the plants affording them are almost cosmopo- 
lite. On board ship, a small packet of dried simples 
would supply the ordinary requirements of a crew, a 
scarcity of water being the only obstacle to be appre- 
hended. Be it remembered, too, that the herb-teas of 
our ancestresses, many of their still-room secrets, and the 
drinks given by Ladies Benevolent to their well-behaved 
poor, and by Beauties Bright to their wounded knights, 
were neither more nor less than true Tisanes. They have 
all this grand merit, — ^that, if they do no good, they can 
scarcely do harm. 

The temperature of this class of medicaments is not 
a matter of indifference. In general, they are taken 
warm, or hot ; the rule is good in a great number of cases, 
but is far from applicable to every derangement of health. 
Inflammatory diseases, other than those of the respira-

toiy passageB or the skin — ^genuine fevers — affections 
wfaioli are acoompanied by a sensation of inwaid burning, 
and in which the breathing is impeded, difficult, or re- 
tarded by debility, — ^require cold drinks; some of them, 
even iced Tisanes. In disease of the Imigs, on the other 
hand, whether with fever and congh, or even without 
fever, but of a catarrhal character, cold drinks are in- 
jurious; hot Tisanes are best, because they fsicilitate 
expectoration. Skin diseases also require hot Tisanes, 
for different reasons. As to the quantity to be imbibed, 
the patient is generally permitted to drink at discretion. 

In a few dropsical cases only would restriction be 
laid on the daily allowance, which would vary according 
to the state, habits, constitution, and complaint of the 
drinker. 

And now for the Beceipts to make various Tisanes, 
fi:t>m high scientific and official authority. They are 
much less difficult than either Medea^s broth, or the more 
modem composition prepared by Macbeth^s witches. 

Burdock Tisane; a purifier. Take of roots of burdock, 
slightly pounded in a mortar, three-quarters of an ounce ; 
of boiling water, one quart. Infiise three hours, strain, 
and decani Prepare in the same manner tisanes firom 
the roots of smallage, angelica, asparagus, elecampane, 
Eoland- thistle, male -fern, strawberry, marsh-mallow, 
patience, and soapwort. Exactly the same for bark 
tisanes, firom gray quinquina, yellow quinquina, fir-tree 
buds, elder, and simarouba — ^a Jamaican tree. 

Polygala Tisane. Take of Virginian polygala, a 
quarter of au ounce; of boiling water, one quart Infuse 



BEVSBAQBS. 659 

two hours, and strain. In the same way you may make 
tisanes from the roots of bitter quassia, sassafras, yalerian, 
and box. 

Couch'-ffrtus TUane; an emollient diuretic, in high 
repute. Wash tluree-quarters of an ounce of couch-grass 
(the roots and the plant) in cold water ; bruise them in 
a marble mortar, and boil them for an hour in a quantify 
of water sufficient to obtain a quart of tisane ; strain 
and decant. In the same way, you can make tisane of 
the roots of the Provence cane, Arundo DonaXy and of 
oomfiey. 

Borage Tisasie. Borage-leaves (dried), half an 
ounce; boiling water, one quart. Infuse for an hour, 
and strain. In the same way, prepare tisanes from the 
leaves of mugwort, capillaire, or maiden's-hair fern, 
vernal speedwell, blessed thistle, chicory, fumitoiy, 
orange-tree, parietary, wild pansy, soapwort, scabious, 
scolopendrium, brooklime, senna, rupturewort, and 
various species of veronica. 

Hyssop Tisane, Hyssop-leaves, a quarter of an 
ounce; boiling water, one quart Iniuse for an hour, 
and strain. Proceed similarly for tisanes from the leaves 
of calamint, ground ivy, horehound, balm, marjoram, 
and sage. Here we are in the category of aromatic 
herb-drinks; and why need a man die whose garden 
gives him sage ? —

preparation for tisanes of camomile-flowers, field poppy, 
fever few, and elder. 

MtJlein-fiower Tisane. Mnllein-Uossoms, a quarter 
of an ounce ; boiling water, one quart Infuse for an 
hour, and strain. The same for tisanes of the litde 
oentaarj, marsh*mallow, common mallow, red roees, 
lime-tree, coltsfoot, and violets. All these are tonic and 
mucilaginous bitters, excitants of perspiration. 

Aniseed Tisane. Seed, a quarter of an ounce ; boil- 
ing water, one quart Infuse two hours, and strain. So 
also are prepared tisanes of juniper-berries, bitter-orange 
peel, and linseed, commonly called linseed tea. 

Prune Tisane. French Plums or Prunes, two ounoes 
and a half; cut them in two, and boil them an hour in 
a sufficient quantity of water to make a quart of tisane ; 
strain through a sieve. Thus, likewise, for tisanes of 
dates, figs, and jujubes. 

Rice Tisane^ known better as Rice Water. Boil half 
an ounce of rice, till it is cracked and broken up to a 
mash, in a sufficient quantity of water to make a quart 
of the beverage ; strain through a coarse sieve. The 
same mode serves for Pearl-barley WaJter and Oatmeal 
Water. 

Veal BrotL Lean fillet of veal, the third of a pound ; 
river-water, one quart Cook over gentle heat in a 
dose-covered vessel for two hours; strain the broth 
when cold. The same for broths of calf's lights, chicken, 
IJpesh-water crawfish, tortoises, and flrogs — none of which 
ever want a good word from those who speak their 



BEVEBAOSS. 661 

praise — to which list many tisane-lovers would add 
snails, and even snakes. 

N.B. Several of the above-named simples, aa 
borage and marsh-mallow, often produce, when adminis- 
tered as tisane, a loading of the stomach or nausea, 
which the medical attendant maj be tempted to attribute 
to causes unconnected with plants of so little activity. 
This inconvenient and injurious 6£Pect is owing to the 
stiff bristles found on the borage and the cottony down 
on . the calyces of the mallow. These substances, if 
allowed to pass into the tisane by the employment of a 
coarse or imperfect strainer, irritate the stomach by 
their mechanical action. All tisanes from downy plants 
should, therefore, be strained through several folds of fine 
doth, or, better, through filtering paper. 

To the above remarks let us add, that it is better to 
make tisane in small quantities, as wanted, just as you 
would do to have a delicate-fiavoured cup of tea. If the 
flowers or herbs remain too long in their infusion, you 
extract from them more than you want — bitter and 
rough principles belonging to the herbs, which are better 
left behind. Quick-drawn tisane, like whisky from an 
illicit still, is good, because it is made in a hurry. Only

keep the tisane-pot stewing from mom till midnight^ 
Sundays and working days. They change the materials 
of their tisane several times a day, injure their stomachs, 
disorder their digestion, upsetting every intestinal fimc-

at which they drink more and more tisane, running the

WouAN^s special occupation is the administration of her 
household. 

The most useful and honourable knowledge and em- 
ployment for the mother of a family is the science of 
housekeeping. 

It is good order, and not sordid sparing, which raises 
straitened families to easy circumstances. 



Order has three advantages: it relieves our memory; 
it saves our time ; and it preserves our property. 



Economy is a virtue in poverty, a prudential measure 
in moderate circumstances, and a vice in opulence. 



Can the world show a spectacle more touching or 
worthy of respect than that of a mother surrounded by 
her children, directing the labours of her servants, in- 
suring her husband a happy life, and wisely ruling her 
family?

desired very rich, add thereto one pint of new milk ; 
warm it in hot water, till it is about the heat of milk 
from the cow; add rennet (a table-spoonful); let it stand

To Bottle Wine, Before you bottle wine, make sure 
that it is very clear, by putting a small quantity in a 
glass, and then placing it between your eye and the 
light If it is not irreproachably transparent, you must 
wait until it has become so; and, if you cannot attain 
that result, you must transfer the wine to a fresh, clean 
cask, fine it again with white of egg ; when, after a 
certain time, it will indubitably have acquired the re- 
quisite limpidity. The shells and whites of eight eggs, 
well beaten, and mixed with the wine by means of 
a stick, are sufficient to fine- a cask containing three 
hundred bottles. 

Cold weather is the best for bottling wine. At all 
times of the year it is desirable to avoid stormy weather, 
and winds blowing from the south and the west. 

The bottles should have been most careftdly rinsed ; 
for the slightest negligence in this particular may cause 
Texatious consequences. Shot, or small nails, are usually 
•employed in this operation ; but are far from suitable for 
the purpose. A shot or a noil often remains fixed between 
the side of the bottle and the internal swelling. The 
lead which thus remains in contact with the wine may, 
in certain cases, become a source of real poisoning. The 
iron is not injurious to health, but it spoils the colour of 
red wines, and blackens white wines. It is, therefore, 
much more prudent to employ river-gravel, which cleans 
the bottles perfecdy, and a few grains of which, if left in 
the bottle, produce no inconvenience. 

The choice of corks is extremely important Some 
corks are very porous, and, although they stop the bottle 



672 WBimcLES. 

well in appearance, they allow the wine to evapoiate. 
Hard and drj oorks have this effect The best corks are 
those which are fine-grained, soft, yielding to the finger, 
and showing the fewest pores possible. 

To insert the cock, yon tap the cask abont an inch 
and a half above the rim. As soon as a few drops of the 
liquid begin to issue, you withdraw the augur, and drire 
in the cock by hand, avoiding any shock which might 
disturb the lees. As you cannot always manage that, it 
is a good plan to put the tap in its place the day before 
bottling the wine. Beneath it, you set a salad-bowl or 
basin, to catch the wine which escapes when the cock 
is not turned back in time, and which runs over when a 
bottle is filled too full. The bottle applied to the tap to 
be filled ought to be held in a slanting position, to 
prevent the wine from forming a firoth, which woujd 
hinder its being properly filled. 

The bottles should be perfectly corked as fisist as they 
are filled. The cork is driven in with the bat till it 
projects only a quarter of an inch, or less. 

When the wine nearly ceases to flow by the tap, the 
cask is tilted behind, and kept in a position sloping for- 
wards by means of a wooden wedge. The operation 
must be done steadily, and without shaking, to avoid 
disturbing the lees. But after the cask is once tilted, 
the wine left in it must be drawn immediately, whether 
it be clear or thick. The bottles of thick wine should be 
set on one side, upright, to settle, when they may be 
decanted into other bottles, and definitely corked. 

In order that the' bottles may pile well, they ought. 



WBINKLBS. 673 

as far as possible^ to be of the same size and shape. If 
they are of different sorts, they must be ranged in classes 
of the same dimensions. 

After levelling the sand or the earth of the cellar 
where they are to be packed, yon place the first row, 
leaving an interval of half an inch between each bottle ; 
and as they onght to lie horizontally, their necks are 
raised by placing laths beneath them ; then you place a 
lath beneath the necks and another on the bodies of the 
bottles of the first row ; and yon place the second row 
in an opposite direction to the first. The pile ought 
scarcely to be built to a greater height than three feet,, 
unless the bottles are very strong, and exactly similar in 
size and shape. 

The corks should be covered with rosin, to prevent 
them from moulding and from being eaten by the insects 
with which many cellars abound. An excellent prepara- 
tion for sealing bottles is, two pounds of rosin mixed 
with a quarter of a pound of yellow bees'-wax, or a 
couple of ounces of tallow, to prevent its being too 
brittle. It may be coloured with red lead, red ochre, 
ivoiy black, or any other ingredient. Melt and mix it 
well in an earthen vessel over a gentle fire ; then let it 
cool so as to be only just liquid, when you may dip the 
necks of the bottles in it up to the rim roimd the neck, 
Leave the bottles standing upright until the wax is 
perfectly cold, when they may be piled in their places. 
Great caution is requisite not to dip the bottles in the 
wax until it has cooled sufficiently ; for if too hot, it 
will cause the necks of the bottles to Bplit and burst

Accidents have happened in consequence of FooFs

although there is a resemblance between the outward 
aspect of the plants, their smell is completely different 
The mistake, however, may be avoided with certainty by 
using only curled or double parsley y which is equally well

easy to cultivate as the common plain-leaved sort, which

People have been poisoned by eating the scraped root 
of Monk's-hood, which was served to them instead of 
horse-radish. When the two plants are in a growing 
state, it is scarcely possible to confound them; but when 
they are leafless or cut down in winter, a very negligent 
gardener's help might be capable of substituting one for 
the other. Extirpate Monk's-hood, therefore, from your 
garden. Its only recommendation is, that it is an old- 
fashioned cottage-garden flower. But its colouring is 



WBmKLES. 675 

dull and lurid, and there is something forbidding in its 
aspect It is easy, now, to supply its place with hundreds

In the receipts which some Cook-Books give for 
Custard, Ac,, for "laurel-leaf," read "bay-leaf." The 
first is poisonous, containing prussic acid ; the latter is 
simply aromatic, with a perfume approaching to that of 
cinnamon. The two plants are quite different, and 
belong even to different Natural Families. The so- 
called Laurel is a Cherry, Cerasus Lauro-Cerams ; and 
its cousin, the common cherry, contains prussic acid in 
the kernels of its trmt 

The Bay-tree, Lauras nobtlisy is a Laurel, and is a 
near relation te the Camphor-tree, Lauras Camphcra^ 
a highly useful and medicinal plant. The confusion 
may have arisen from Laurier's being French for 
bay-tree, and so finding its way into translated re- 
ceipts; but to avoid all error, it is usually spoken 
of as Laurier a Sauce^ or Sauce-laurel, whereas the 
other is correctly called the Laurier- Cerisey or Cherry- 
Laurel. 

Cherry-laurel leaves should be banished fix)m cook- 
ery, for fear of the results of an over-dose. True, they 
are used, in very dmall quantities, with no perceptible 
evil effect ; but so may arsenic and prussic acid be taken 
(and are even administered medicinaUy) in doses of 
extreme minuteness. Therefore, we repeat, in cookery, 
for " laurel-leaf," read invariably, " bay-leaf."

Mustard Foot-Bath^ in cases o/Apopleayj ^ Take

orders given by the medical attendant. It varies firom 
a qnarter to half a ponnd, or more, for an ordinary-

tenderness or hardness of the patient's skin. Be 
cautions not to keep the feet in too long ; when tingling 
and pricking is felt, or, in cases of nnoonscionsness, 
when the skin tnms very red, it is time to remove them, 
as blistering of the epidermis must be avoided. Great

Bread without Yeast: Question and Answer (from

[Perfectly.] 

A&rated Bread* I cannot indorse your answer to 
Laura. The bread will contain tartrate of soda, which I 
admit is not poisonous; but it is medicinal — slightly 
purgative even: and no medicinal substance ought to 
be employed in food, except in cases where its use is 
indicated. Muriatic acid neutralises soda as well as 
tartaric, and the resulting compound is only common 
salt I have made such bread ; and where yeast cannot 
be got, this mode of making it is vahiable. — S. B.

in abundance. It varies greatlj in appearance, attain- 
ing its greatest size at the months of streams wber& 
fresh water, and the matters it brings with it, mingle 
with the sea. Some of the forms which it assumes are 
frequently very much lobed and fringed ; notwithstand- 
ing which, those who have seen it onoe will have little 
difficulty in recognising it again. In Harvey's excellent 
Atlas of British Sea-weedsj two varieties are given at 
PI. XLIY. Fig. 202. The samples sold in tho shops are 
mostly bleached or colourless. As it grows, it is of a 
doll, brownish red, increasing in depth with age. Spring 
and summer are the best seasons for gathering it 

When fresh, it requires several careful washings and 
pickings over, separating the tufted fronds into sprigs. 
Boil it down (for two or three hours) in plain water to 
a jelly ; pass it through a cullender, and let it stand to- 
settle. Pour it off from the impurities at the bottom^, 
and use it for the preparation of jellies and blancmanges,, 
exactly as if it were isinglass. 

Carrageen is one of the restoratives which require* 
faith on the part of those who take it When rendered 
as nearly insipid as possible by repeated steeping and 
washing (in which case much of its virtue may be also- 
washed away), it still retains a certain flavour of the 
shore, which is distasteful to some, although others get 
to like it by use, just as there are patients who become 
fond of cod-liver oil. A course of Irish-moss blanc-

Bed DtdsBy or JDUlisk — Khodymenia palmata (Harvey's 
Atlas^ PI. XLL Figs. 189 and 190). Another Sea- 
weed, mostly eaten uncooked as a salad, no doabt with 
benefit to the general health. 

At first sight, Harvey's Synopsis of British Sea- 
weeds tells lis, it will scarcely be supposed that the 
specimens selected for the illustration of this species 
belong to the same plant ; and yet these figures by no 
means exhibit the extreme of variation ; for there are 
varieties more simple than the one, and more finely 
divided than the other. 

When such varieties are seen in a dried state in the 
herbarium, they appear so different that one may anti- 
cipate much difficulty in tracing the limits of the species. 
But on the shore, the collector experiences no such 
difficulty. If he has once seen and tasted a piece of 
Dulse, the characters, irrespective of form, are too well 
marked to allow of his puzzling himself with mere 
variations in ontUne; and, what is very remarkable, 
the broad and the slightly divided varieties may often 
be found growing side by side with the finely cut narrow 
ones. 

In Ireland and Scotland, this plant is much used 
by the poor, as a relish with their food. It is commonly 
dried in its unwashed state, and eaten raw, the flavour 
being brought out by long chewing. On many parts of 
the west coast of Ireland, it forms the only addition to 
potatoes in the meals of the poorest dass. The variety 
which grows on mussel-shells between tide-marks is 
preferred, being less tough than the other forms ; and 



680 WRINKLES. 

the minute mussel-shells and other small shell-fish which 
adhere to its folds are nowise unpleasing to the con- 
sumers of this simple luxniy, who rather seem to enjoy 
the additional goiU imparted by the crunched mussels. 
In the Mediterranean, this plant is used in a cooked 
form, entering into ragoiits and made dishes; and it 
forms a chief ingredient in one of the soups recom- 
mended, under the name of St. Patrick's Soup, by 
M. Soyer to the Irish peasantry.

pots ready prepared fi-om the south-west of England,

is to heat it up with a little butter and orange or lemon- 
juice, and serve it as an accompaniment to roast meat 
in general, and mutton in particular. When received 
fresh, as gatliered from the rocks, it requires careful 
washing in sea-water, and a long, patient stewing in 
soft, firesh water. 

Soyer says : ^^ It is merely washed, boiled, pulped, 
and potted by the fishermen's wives. It is considered 
wholesome ; but I see nothing particular in it that can 
make it so, utdesa it is tJie small quantity of iodine that it

time, doctors could discover nothing in burnt sponge 
that should make it cure the goitre, unless it was the 
iodine. One of Soyer's predecessors (1807) tells us 
that ^^ Laver is a great sweetener of the blood. It is 
seldom liked at first, but people become extremely fond 
of it by habit" As a rule, old-established popular 
belief in these matters is seldom quite without founda-

ScupaiTs JEau SSdative — Sedative Lotioru 

Liquid Ammonia^ two ounces ; 

Camphorated Spirit of Wine, one-third of an ounce ; 

Coarse kitchen salt, one ounce ; 

Bain-water, one quart. 

Mix separately in a botde the camphorated spirit 
with the liquid ammonia; stop carefully, shake the 
bottle, and let the mixture repose an instant 

In another vessel dissolve the salt in the water, 
adding a few drops of liquid ammonia. When the salt 
is completely dissolved, and its impurities settled, pour 
it off gently, or filter it through filtering-paper. Then 
pour in rapidly the mixed spirit and ammonia; oork 
it, and shake all weU together. It is then ready for 
use ; and must always be kept carefiiUy stopped. 

This lotion is excellent to apply to the bites of

RaspaiTa Treatment of Chilblains. Bathe the chil- 
blained member (foot or hand) for ten minutes in a 
mixture of half tepid water and half the above Sedative

care to keep it warm in large and thick gloves or stock* 
ings.

K ihe chQblain is obstinate, wash it frequently, some- 
times with camphorated spirit, sometimes with rain- 
water. 

If the skin is cracked, cover it with camphorated 
cerate and linen, and apply a bandage soaked in sedative 
lotion to the imbroken parts. 

N.B. The cause of chilblains is the influx and con- 
gestion of the blood in the capillary vessels of the cuta- 
neous tissue, under the influence of an abrupt transition 
from warmth to severe cold.

Dissolve the salt (which will be a good handful) in 
the water. When the impurities of the salt have settled 
at the bottom, and the water has become limpid again, 
decant it carefully into another vessel, and add to it the 
juice of a lemon. It is then an aromatised oyster liquor ;

An excellent vermifuge, and even an active aperient,

the quarter of a tumbler of this saline lemonade. 

Coarse, unrefined^salt is preferable, for the purpose, 
on account of the iodides and bromides which it contains. 



De jRheims* Paper^ for Chilblains^ Buma^ Bruises^ 



684 WSIKKLES. 

This receipt alone is worth the price of the book. 
The reader, after trial and approbation, may testify his 
gratitade, bj sending a nicety made sheet or two, ad- 
dressed to ns at the Publisher's. 

Our friend, the late M. Charles De Bheims, of 
Calais, who gave us the receipt, was a man of great ac- 
quirements, simple manners, and cheerful disposition ; a 
good linguist, well versed in the physical sciences, with 
extensive observation, and a kindly heart. He spent 
nine years as ^^ Pharmacien" with Napoleon I/s army 
in Spain, and, while there, often amused himself with 
the ignorance and superstition of the people. One of 
his freaks was to walk into a blacksmith^s shop, when 
crowded with gossips, and ask for a red-hot iron at 
which to light his cigar. On a glowing bar being pre- 
sented to him, he would complain that it was too cool ; 
which he proved by licking it with his tongue, and beg- 
ging them to heat it a little hotter I Of course he passed 
for a sorcerer of the blackest species ; and the Inquisi- 
tion, doubtless, would have laid hands upon him, only 
that they Ivad to come and take him. 

We know now how and why M. De Bheims was able 
to lick a red-hot poker with impunity; but, at that 
time, neither M. Boutigny had written his treatise on 
the Spheroidal State of Matter, nor Dr. l^dall his 
masterly Heat considered as a Mode of Motion. 

The invention of the Paper is due to observations 
made by M. De Bheims' father of the curative effects 
of pepper, in case of wounds or other injuiy. 

Make a strong tincture of capsicum -pods by 



WBIKELES. 685 

steeping them for several days, in a warm place, in 
twice their weight of rectified spirits of wine. 

Dissolve gom-arabic in water to about the con- 
sistency of treacle. Add to this an equal quantity of 
the tincture, stirring it together with a small brush or 
a large camePs hair pencil, until they are well in- 
corporated. The mixture will be cloudy and opaque. 

Take sheets of silk or tissue-paper ; give them with 
the brush a coat of the mixture ; let them dry, and then 
give another. Let that dry, and, if the surface is 
shining, there is enough of the peppered gum ; if not, 
give a third coat. 

This Paper, applied in the same way as Court 
Plaister to chilblains that are not hrokerij and lurma that 
are not blisteredy speedily relieves the itching and the 
pain. It acts like a charm, and effects a rapid cure. 
The same with cuts and discoloured bruises. It likewise 
allays rheumatic pains in the joints. Its great value is 
that, besides acting as ordinary sticking-plaister, it 
abates suffering and hastens the process of hosting. So 
great is our experience of its usefulness, that we never 
stir without ii^when we happen to have it 

In the tropical countries whence we procure capsi- 
cums, and where their culture is of the easiest, they are 
both abundantly used as an article of diet, and also 
employed as external tonics and stimidants. Another 
kind of pepper is used by Ethiopian negroes to cure the 
tooth-ache. Slave-masters in the Indian Islands use 
decoction of the true Guinea pepper to wash the backs 
of negroes who have been flayed with the whip, not as an

additional pnnishment or torture, bat to prevent Hieir 
wounds fix>m gangrening. West-Indian doctors em- 
ploj the leaves of the Jamaica pepper-tree to make baths 
for the legs of dropsical patients, and in ^mentations 
for limbs attacked by paralysis. 



From Dr. Edward Smith^a Handbills (/or Distribution 
amongst the Poor)y indicating the Cheapest and Best Ends 
of Food, 

Select households or seconds bread or flour. 

Do not eat bread when it is new ; but keep bakers* 
bread one day, and home-made bread three days. Do 
not keep it too dry, but cover it up in an earthen pan. 
When it has become dry, make it into puddings or add 
it to broth. 

New milk is heUer food than skim milL Skim milk 
is cheaper food than new milk ; and, when used for a 
pudding, you may make it as good as new milk by 
adding a littie suet — say from a quarter to half an 
ounce — to each pint. 

Pease are very strong food for both grown people 
and children, and should be eaten once or twice a week 
all the year round. If you bake your bread at home, 
add sometimes one pound of pea-meal to the stone of 
flour, and it will make a more nutritious bread. 

When potatoes are grown by the labourer, they cost 
only the rent of the land, the manure, and tiie seed, 
and are therefore very cheap food; but when they 
are bought, they are veiy dear food — much dearer than 



WRINKLES. 687 

flour. Do not peel them before boiling, unless you 
have a pig to eat the peel; but boil them first, and 
peel them as you eat them. 

Fats of some kind are most necessary to health, and 
particularly for growing children and youths who can- 
not obtain sufficient new milk. Do not buy much 
butter or lard. Fresh butter is a very dear food. If 
you can buy the fiit which butchers cut off the loin and 
neck of mutton at fourpence or fivepence per pound, 
do so. Bender it down, or cut it into bits and add it 
to puddings, or fiy the vegetables with it. Obtain as 
much dripping as possible from your richer neighbours 
— ^who will give away (not allow to be wasted) what is 
not wanted for their own household requirements. 

Never take tea without real food, as bread; and 
never regard tea as food. When made very weak, it is 
only useful from the warm water, sugar, and milk which 
it contains : yet one ounce of tea costs as much as several 
pints of good, sweet skim milk. 



^^ Although starch is insoluble in water, and is thus 
unfit for digestion, it is easily converted into sugar. All 
ferments convert it into sugar. The saliva secreted in 
the mouth contains a ferment known by the name of 
mlivmy which immediately converts starch into sugar. 
Hence, when we take starch into our mouths, it is con- 
verted into sugar ; and it is in the form of sugar, which 
is soluble in water, that it is carried into the blood. On 
this account, it is important, in eating food containing 



688 WBINELES* 

starchy that It should be retained a short time in the 
mouthy in order that it may be well mixed with saliva. 
The practice of making babies swallow starch-food 
hastily is injurious, as the starch is thus preyented finom 
being converted into sugar, is not therefore digested, 
dogs the stomach and bowels, and frequentiy produces 
disease." — Dr. Lankester's " Good Foodj'' p. 32. 



'^Fat is so essential to the maintenance of healthy 
nutrition, that the quantity contained in the daOy food 
cannot be much reduced without the greatest risk. The 
importance of fat in nutrition should be studiously borne 
in mind by those who construct diets for the poor, for 
public institutions, or for the treatment of obesiiy, 
diabetes, fatiy degeneration, dyspepsia, and the like." — 
Dr, DdbelVs " Manual of Diet and Ryvmofu*^ 

^^ A healthy man, weighing 154 pounds, contains in 
his body twelve pounds of fat. This constitutes more 
than a thirteenth part, by weight, of his body. When 
this proportion is not maintained, the body gets thin ; 
and this is characteristic of some of the most dangerous 
diseases to which the human body is subject The loss 
of fat is especially seen in that commonly fatal disease, 
consumption ; and one of the most effectual methods of 
treating this fatal disease is the administration of fatiy 
articles of food. One of the most readily appropriated 
oils is cod-liver oil, and this substance is consumed 
throughout the world in prodigious quantities as a 
remedy in consumption, scrofula, and allied diseases. 



WBIKELXS. 689 

(Hher forms of fisitty food may be saooessfully taken 
where ood-liver oil is objected to, or caxmot be pro- 
eared. Thus, cream may be given with great advantage 
to children, and the diet of scrofidous children and con- 
fenmptive persons may be always improved by the 
addition of cream cheese." — Dr. Lankester^s '^ Good 
Food;' p. 39.

butter at break&st, and no bread at dinner.'' — Dr. Lan-

BILLS OF PARE. 

WITH REASONS FOB THEM. 

Etebt repast, however £ragal, has neoessarilj its Bill 
of Fare, simple or complicated, written or miwritten ; 
that is, a decision must be made as to what food is 
intended to be served, and orders in accordance given ; 
for which orders, reasons will exist 

The most elementary, thongh not flie least important, 
Bills of Fare, are those in which the sick-room is con- 
cerned ; when, the crisis of an illness being past, the 
means of restoring strength are sought, with as KtUe 
exertion of digestive power as possible. These more 
particularly belong to the Doctor and the Nurse, who 
will often undertake to prepare herself the nutriment 
she has thus to administer. As aids to her memory and 
suggestive hints, the preceding pages will be found to 
contain an ample choice of light things for the com- 
position of invalid rnenus ; to which we will add a few 
words here. 

First, there is the Beef-Tea and Essence-of-Meat 
question to consider. 

Beef'Tea^ A. Take one pound of gravy beef, and 
cut away every particle of fat Mince the beef with a 
chopping-knife, and set it on the fire in a saucepan with 



BILLS OF FABB. 691 

three-qnarterB of a pint of cold water. Press it with a 
wooden spoon till it boils. Add a salt-spoon of salt, and 
let it simmer gentlj for a quarter of an hour ; then pour 
the tea from the beef, but do not strain it, and serve with 
dry toast, or rice boiled lightly, as for curry. My nephew, 
Dr. Priestly, says that beef-tea shoidd not be too clear; 
a portion of the fibre he assumes to be very advantageous 
and nutritive. — Mrs. W, H, W. 

Dr. DdbeWe Beef-Tea. " Beef (rump-steak, minced), 
1 lb. ; cold water, 1 lb. Macerate two hours at a 
temperature not exceeding ISO"* Fahrenheit: to yield 
one pint of beef-tea." 

Dr. Lankester^e Beef-'Tea. " It is one peculiarity of 
albuminous food, that it digests more easily before cook- 
ing than after ; oysters, although eaten alive and raw, 
are found to digest very easily. The longer albumen is 
cooked, the more indigestible does it become. Thus, in 
making beef-tea, it becomes important to prevent the 
albumen of the blood from coagulating. The beef should 
therefore be sliced, put into cold water for an hour or 
two, then squeezed and removed, and heated up to the 
point at which it is pleasant to drink." 

Dr. Edward Smith, in his Practical Dietary ^ demon- 
strates, with irresistible logic, the small dietetic value of 
Essences or Extracts of Meats. They are prepared from 
fi*e8h meat, in such a manner that the fibre and the fat 
are rejected, and only the osmazome (or flavouring 
property), certain salts, and a very small quantity of 
albumine, remain. In consequence of the presence of 
the first-mentioned substance, with a teaspoonful of the 



692 



BlIXS OF FABE. 



Essence about a pint of soup maj be made, which, although 
thin to the palate, is as foil of the fioaxnar of meat as 
when beef-tea is prepared at home. Hie salts are not 
perceptible to the senses; but they consist in part oS. 
phosphates, and are very valuable. The albumine is 
necessarily in very small quantity, £rom the small amount 
of the extract of meat which is used. 

Ifow, no eombinaticm, of nutritive elements can be 
offered to the body in a form more concentrated than its 
own flesh ; and the flesh of animals is almost identical in 
composition with our own. It is true that flesh consists 
of water to the extent of 77 per cent, and that only 23 
per cent of the whole is nutritive material ; but the solid 
elements cannot be obtained in a nutritive form without 
water ; neither could they be digested in a solid state. 
But it is aflirmed fhat one ounce of the Essence, derived 
from thirty ounces of beef, nevertheless contains the 
nutritive parte of those thirty ounces. 

Can this be so ? asks Dr. Smith. A large amount of 
fibre, with fibrine, gelatine, fat, and some albumine, are 
rejected ; and it is affirmed that the former is not nutri- 
tious, because dogs fed exclusively upon it do not live I 
The fallacy of this is, fortunately, as obvious as it is 
serious. That fibre is digestible, is proved by the fiict 
that, in fresh meat, nearly all of it is digested ; that it is 
highly nutritive, is proved by its chemical composition. 
Hence, to throw away this material is a folly of the 
grossest kind. That it will not aUme support life is 
certain, in consequence of the fact that salts — necessary 
to life — and fat— highly important to life— *have been re- 



BILLS OF FABE. 693 

moved ; but this does not in the least prove that it is not 
of great value as a part of our dietary. It was dearly 
shown in our opening chapter that a varied alimentation 
is indispensable to health. 

As fibre and fat constitute by far the greater propor- 
tion of the solid parts of flesh, it follows that the so-called 
Essences contain so small a proportion of the nutritive 
parts of flesh, that they can scarcely be regarded as 
nutrient foods. When one teaspoonful of the essence or 
extract has been dissolved in about a pint of hot water, 
and seasoned with pepper and salt, it forms an agreeable 
and stimulating food ; and in this respect, as weU as in 
the small quantity of nutriment which it ofiers, it must 
be ranked no higher than tea or cofiee. It may be 
advantageously thickened with a little sago ; vermicelli, 
maccaroni, and other Italian pastes, are also 4igreeable 
and useful additions. 

For persons in health, it is manifestly better that the 
housewife should make beef-tea firom shins of beef (so as 
to obtain much gelatine), or from gravy-beef; and should 
serve up the solid part, as food, at the same meal. Our 
Continental neighbours eat their Jxmili and potage at ^ 
same repast; and so should we. The great value of 
Liebig's essence of meat consists in its readiness in emer^ 
gendes during illness. It is also useful to the traveUer; 
since it occupies a very small space, and, with hot water, 
he may at any time prepare a basin of soup in two 
minutes, which will be more useful to liim than any other 
fluid. It is particularly suited to those who abstain from 
intoxicating drinks. 



694 BILLS OF FABE. 

Oatmeal GrueL Aooording to the ihicknesB 
mb smooth in a basin one or two table-spoonfiils of oat- 
meal, with three of water. Stir, by d^rees, into this a 
pint of boiling water ; set it on the fire in a sanoqmn, 
and boil ten minates, stirring all the while. Then strain 
it through a cullender into the basin in which it is to be 
served. 

Gruel thus made with milk is more nutritious; 
seasoned with salt and butter, it is less insipid. With 
the medical man's permission, a dessert- spoonful of 
brandy, or a table-spoonful of wine, may be added. 

Gruel made firom Oaten Groats requires more ^vat^, 
and takes longer boiling. When ready, the groats may 
be either strained away, or eaten, if liked, together with 
the gruel ; in which latter case, they will help to give 
support 

N.B. The nutritive properties of oatmeal gruel ought 
to be more widely known than they are. Although the 
Scotch bothy system of diet will never be adopted in 
England, it is yet advisable to insist on the fact that the 
regimen of oatmeal and milk has produced some of the 
finest specimens of humanity. General Mackenzie used 
to be fond of relating how he became acquainted with the 
finest man in the Guards. He saw him breaking stones 
by the side of the road ; and, struck with his application, 
as well as his symmetry, he questioned him as to his 
manner of living. The answer was : ^^ Porridge for 
breakfast, porridge for dinner, and porridge for supper." 
The wonderful endurance of the Scotch regiments when 
on foreign service — who, we are told, take a little raw 



BILLS OF FABE. 695 

oatmeal from their meal-bag, and stir it up with water 
from the brook or pond — is another proof of the value of 
this grain. Indeed, we may assert, no other food is to 
be found so capable of sustaining health and strength as 
oatmeal and milk : the latter containing all that is re- 
quired, even to the water and salts ; and the former being 
so nioelj balanced, as regards its carbonaceous and nitro- 
genous matter, as to require very little addition, being 
102 flesh-formers, and 68 fat- and heat-formers, or 
very nearly what science teaches us is wanted for wear 
and tear, besides leaving a small portion of fiit to be 
deposited <against emergencies of exposure to cold. 



Gamey Dressed far an Invalid, Take the plump breast 
of a fresh partridge ; remove the skin, with any fibres or 
sinews, and mince it very fine. Put it in a saucepan

Panada. Break into a saucepan, cruinb of bread a 
little larger than an egg ; cover it with water, milk-and-

while. Then add half a teaspoonfol of salt, two ounces

Within the last thirty or foriy years, a wonderfbl 
change has taken place in the English mode of serving 
meals. One of Ihe most strennons advocates of refonn 
in this matter was the late Mr. Walker, a metropolitan 
police magistrate, who, in his Original^ forcibly demon- 
strated the possibilify of dining well off very few dishes, 
and with a moderate allowance of fermented beverage. 
The movement spread ; private families rapidly discovered 
the convenience, the wholesomeness, the economy, and, 
consequently, the comfort of the plan. ^^ Little Dinners^* 
—-that most agreeable mode of meeting friends-— became 
recognised as an institution, especially when it was found 
that several pleasant, easily arranged entertainments might 
be given for the cost of one expensive, troublesome, and 
wasteful monster banquet. No more mountains of rem- 
nants were left, which no family could consume while 
they were eatable. There was found to be truth in the 
homely adage, " Enough is as good as a Feast," — better 
even. 

All persons in easy circumstances were benefited; 
but especially the Professional, Literary, and Sedentary 
Members of Society ; the two first, by the saving of time 
thereby effected ; all, by the relief to their digestive oigans. 



BILLS OF FARE. 697 

Indigestion is a maladj which sorelj troubles seden- 
tary and studious persons, whether thej be themselves pro- 
dnoers, or investigators merely, of literature. The form 
of indigestion to which they are most liable is, probably, 
that known as saburral, — ^which is an imperfect digestion 
of previous meals, a loading of the stomach, producing an 
unpleasant sense of fulness immediately a few mouthfuls 
have been eaten. The remedy for this is as much air 
and exercise as possible, together with slight aperients, if 
needed; and, above all, great moderation in the quantity 
of food taken, — something, in short, approaching to 
abstinence, — ^nntil the indisposition has completely passed 
away. 

Emetics are sometimes administered in these cases ; 
but they are, to say the least, an uneertaiu means of cure, 
and may^ cause derangement of the digestive functions 
worse than that they were called in to remedy. 

with strong and repeated emetics until she reftised to 
take more. But the vomiting continued after the first 
exciting cause of it was withdrawn. Scarcely a meal 
could be retained on the stomach ; tonics and efiervescent 
drinks were tried in vain. The patient became thinner 
and thinner, rapidly losing strength, until considerable 
uneasiness was felt by her friends. Internal medicines 
seemed unavailing, when she was suddenly and efifectually 
cured by the application of a blister to the pit of the 
stomach. But she will never take an emetic again. 

Persons whose habits or whose avocations keep them

Nothing is easier than to vary them^ by reference to tho 
preceding chapters, when once the principle is adopted, 
ThxU it is desirable to vcary the composition of dinners from 
day to day J instead of combining great variety in the 
same meal or dinner. 

Entertainments, or dinners given to firiends, cannot 
be so simple as the above ; yet, they will be found to go 
off better, to be more thoroughly appreciated, and to 
accord with the common sense of the guests invited, if 
they are governed by the rule of having as few unneces- 
saries as possible. This rule, of course, hangs to a 
sliding scale depending on the dinner-giver's position 
and income ; but it is surely possible to hit the happy 
mean which harmonises with the entertainer's means 
and station. This maxim, however, may be safely laid 
down : that, for a limited number of guests, as at a 
dinner — t.e. when a crowd is not expected, as at a ball, 
rendering the calculation of quantities difficult — ^it is 
vulgar, and in bad taste, to put too much upon a 
table. 

This branch of the subject is best iUustrated by 
examples. Some, excellent Bills of Fare, with the pre- 
paration of the dishes composing them, are given in 
CobIAs in Search of a Cook. To these we can only leftr 
the reader ; the book is well worth the trifle it costs. We 
present a few others, which have not yet been published 
in any volume.

" A Derbyshire Peakrill," Avriting to tlie Tbiies^ says: 

^' I liko occasionally to diiio my frieuds^ and to do so 
without draining my pocket. I, therefore, give you the 
fare provided for my ten guests yesterday. You will 
perceive that I adhere to home productions as much as 
possible, and tliat economj'^ is strictly studied. 

" First, I had crawfish soup, made upon a veal-stock 
foundation (tlie stock prepared as for vermicelli soup), 
the tails of the fish cut into long, tliin strips, and the 
remainder rubbed tlirough a sieve. 

"My only Fish was Dove Grayling boiled, plain 
melted butter, and home-made mushroom ketchup, with 
a boiled potato, hot, mealy, and not overdone. A glass 
of good old-fashioned brown sheny, matured under a 
tropical sun, was the only concomitant. 

" Rabbits ? Yes ; rabbits boiled, or rather gently 
stewed, in milk (with a garnish of alternate slices of 
broiled ham and fat boiled bacon, home-cured, rolled 
round, and enclosing the white pulled fibres of another 
rabbit), were accom2)anied by stewed celery and white 
sauce, and sea-kale and good melted butter. No toast 
under either vegetable, to absorb the flavour and be left 
in the dish. 

" A Hamich of small mountain mutton, wliich had 
hung five weeks, with mashed potatoes and fresh, hot, 
boiled ditto, for the next remove. Tlio only two side 
dishes were sweetbreads and oyster patties; and these 
I would gladly have dispensed with^ but my better-half 
had two handsome silver (electro-plated) side dishes, and 
these must necessarily be used. Sparkling Moselle (no

sham Champagne will I tolerate) was now to me Yerj 
agreeable. 

^^ A grayhen and a couple of woodcocks^ all roasted 
before an open fire; captains' biscuits and muBhrooms; 
a cabinet podding, and a damson tart, — concluded the 
dinner. 

^^The Dessert consisted of fqpples, pears, ofires, pre- 
served ginger, and some nondescripts — ^the joj of some 
people's hearts, but not of mine ; the garnish, mountain 
heath, moss, and bilberry boughs. 

^^The wines: Full-bodied in^ claret (!); matured, 
but not exhausted, port; and East-India brown sherry. 
The dinner was served up hot ; and no hitch occurred, 
simply because too much was not attempted. Though 
your professed gourmand may sneer at my simple fare, 
I assure you that smiling &ces and good digestions 
insured a pleasant evening. I trust I may learn from 
the Timesj the world's instructor, how to give a better 
dinner at the same expense." 

The above Bill of Fare is excellent; especially 
because it admits of variation to any extent, retaining the 
groundwork of the original plan. It is also capable of 
simplification. The gray hen and woodcocks, after the 
mountain mutton, are unnecessary. When game is 
served, by giving plenty of it, it takes the place of the 
roast, which may be suppressed. ^^Inky claret," we 
venture to suggest, is an error ; accidental, probably. The 
beauly of claret (next to its bouquet) consists in its 
brilliant limpidity. The word " claret" is derived from 
the French ckur — clear, light-coloured; and dairety

therefore, or claret wine, should not be inkj. The 
Derbyshire Peakrill is advised to try some of the best 
Hungarian wines, which, without being ^^inky,'* are 
full of flavour. 

In the same number of the leading journal, ^^A 
Housekeeper to 800L per annum'^ gives a practical 
illustration of the difference of cost between an Old- 
Fashioned and a Reformed Dinner, the prices given 
being those of the locality in which she lives, and which 
of course might vary in other neighbourhoods.

Each guest may thus partake of ten dishes. Those 
over ten, on the old system ^ served merely to fill the table. 

This, too, is a good dinner, not difficult to serve hot 
It is also capable of simplification; the Sweetbread 
and the Game are quite superfluous. For English 
dinners, wo repeat, are passing through a i^volutiouary 
phase, which is not even yet quite complete nor univers- 
ally adopted.* Wliile taking care to have sufficient, let 
there be abundance mitliout profusion. A rich man cau 
always display his wealth in tlie quaUty and tlie kind of 

* In reference to this topic, we cannot refrain from quoting a letter 
addressed by S. G. O. to the Times: 

" A comparatively poor man myself, I have ever pitied the great 
unemployed rich class ; they can get through a great deal of wealth** 
inconvenience by paid agency, but no one can eat, drink, sleep, and 
digest fur them : these ai'e duties which cannot be done by deputy. 
The wealthy, per force of their position, must have large, expensive 
establishments ; they are doomed to live in * show' houses ; they are 
the proper consumers of the produce of decorative art ; but they yet 
have to eat: and here comes the question, How can they eat in 
character ? How can they dine up to their pictures, sculpture, plate, 
music, &c. ? 

*' As I have often gone through the process of participation in one 
of these so-called good dinners, I am quite alive to the effect which 
can be produced by a deep and skilful attention to kitchen and cellar 
chemistry, with its appropriate accompaniments ; whether the result 
was worth the labour, I may have doubted. Yes, I have mused at such 
a scene on what the affair has cost in the actual value of the articles 
called into use ; on the skill necessary to develop the full resources of 
the culinary staff; on the training necessary to qualify the gentleman, 
the under-gentlemen, and the liveried attendants. I by calculation 
arrived at the fact that for such a dinner for sixteen persons, there would 
never be less than 1 500 articles each day to be placed and displaced, a 
great proportion of them requiring cleaning ; in some houses, many 
more articles are used for such a party. It was an affiur, perhaps, of tifto 
hours from leaving the drawing room to returning to it Sixteen pe«)plc 
had dined, out of whom it might safely be said some six or eight had 
previous to the dinner-hour really taken all the food (bow vulgar a

the dishes he offers you, without overwhehning you with 
tlieir number. In short, never put too much upon tho 
table. 

Tlie error is much easier to avoid now than it was 
thirty or forty years ago. The merit of moderation, 
then, was a distinguished mark of good taste and dis- 
cernment. In olden time (see the Cookery Books, witli 
dinners for every month, and even every day, of tho 
year), a table, at each course, had to be covered with a 
set number of dishes, as precisely fixed and as numerous 

word I) they really needad, or really cared for. Still, * the thing* had 
been well done, the guests had been g^'atified with a good dinner of 
'the day ;' it was now established, the dinners at house are first- 
rate ; the sons of the house receive all club honuige for the fact ; the 
fathers are satisfied it should be so, and pay the cost, mental and 
financial. 

" I have no disposition to moralise on this feature of opulent life ; 
I know all that can be said about it in a 'serious* spirit is too evident 
to require rehearsal at my hands. 

*'If I pity the rich man in table difiiculty, I have no feeling for 
800/. a year sufferers. If these will ape the customs and aim at tho 
table appliances of the opulent, they can but fail, and look tho fools 
they are. Let them stick to joints, chops, steaks, and occasional 
cutlets ; get these well done ; have good potatoes, well boiled ; bo 
particular in their beer and porter ; as to wines, let them get, if they 
can, good sherry and port, but even with these be chary of dailtf 
extravagance. As to all the fiddle-faddle about side dishes, flowers* 
and fruit for the table, it is in their case simple flunkey ism, belongs to 
the school where white-cotton gloves mask the gardener's good, honest, 
soil-grained thumbs, and the coachman (so-called) has to tread deli- 
cately for the day, that he may not savour of the stable at dinner. I 
believe the dinners of the middle classes, of the clergy, professional 
men, and small esquires, are, as the rule, excellent in their way, wher- 
ever the ruling power of the house has the common sense necessary to 
offer only what can be served with ease, served plainly, and well 
cooked, — when, with no fear of a break-down, the host or hostess, or 
both, can give themselves to entertain their guests at an unostentatious 
meal in keeping with the house and the known means of the owner.*' 



710 BILLS OF FABE. 

as the pieces on a chess-board. They served for oma- 
meiit rather than for use, as it was impossible to tajste one- 
third of them hot ; and the leavings of a dinner-party 
were awfully hard work for a family to get through with. 
At present, the modem fashions of substituting the white 
table-doth for the brown mahogany at dessert, of decor- 
ating the table with that dessert and with flowers from 
the beginning, and of carving joints at side-tables and 
handing the dishes round, relieve the dinner-giver of all 
temptation to make ostentatious displays of masses of 
meat. 

On the other hand, as excess in the quantify of the 
united meal is coarse and vulgar, so scantiness in the 
supply of any one particular dish is not mean (for it is 
sometimes unavoidable), but simply absurd. A dish 
should never have le ffoiH de trofp peu — " the taste of too 
little." This is the great objection to side dishes con- 
taining a few mouthfuls of some expensive delicacy, '^ to 
please the ladies," when one lady could clear the dish 
without assistance. Therefore, if you cannot produce 
enough green pease, asparagus, or early strawberries, 
for each person who sees them to have a fair portion, 
suppress them altogether. Remember Thackeray's sketch 
in Punch: "Will you take a little game, my dear?" 
A lady and gentleman are entertaining. The servant 
lifts an immense silver cover from a vast silver dish, on 
which reposes — a roasted lark !

tsaving of breakage. It neither excites the envy of neigh- 
bours nor the greed of thieves, like the golden dishes of 
royalty. 

Onoe, when Louis XIY. of France was giving a 
state dinner to the royal family, the courtiers (as was 
then the custom) crowded round the table, to witness 
the grace with which his Majesty picked a pheasant- 
bone. Amongst them, Arlequin Dominique, the famous 
actor, could not take his eyes off a brace of partridges 
which lay upon a golden dish. The king observing it, 
good-humouredly said, " Give that dish to Dominique.'* 
^^Beally, Sire! and the partridges too?" replied the 
ready Arlequin. His Majesty, stupefied, hesitated an 
instant ; and then, laughing at the fellow's impudence, 
added, ^^ Tes, and the partridges too I" 

Every body wishes to give good dinners. Large 
dinners puzzle the givers, because they have not con- 
sidered the theory of dining — ^which theory our dining- 
room reforms enable us now to put in practice. The 
old system was as if a party of twenty were an individual 
ogre possessing a twenty-man appetite. But a dinner- 
party is not an individual ; it is an assembly of indi- 
viduals, a combination of units. Take, therefore, a good 
dinner for one ; multiply its quantity by twenty, and you 
have a good dinner for twenty. One man cannot par- 
take of fifty different dishes at the same meal ; neither 
can twenty men each partake of fifty different dishes at 
one repast Only, in providing for a party, you may 
have a few more dishes than in providing for one person, 
to aUow far the d^erence of taster If the tastes of the 



712 BILLS OF FARE. 

guests were alike and accordant, not a single extra dish 
would be required. 

What, then, is a good dinner for one ? Let us take 
tlie standard universally acknowledged as sufficient in 
Paris. It may be tasted any day at such convenient 
places as the Diner de Paris, Passage Jouffroy, 
nearly op{x>site to the Theatre des Varices ; or at the 
Hotel de France et d'Anglcterre, Hue des Filles SL 
Thomas, leaduig out of the Place do la Bourse. 

Each person is supposed to require a plate of soup ; 
then a hors cCanivre or two {Le. a bit of butter, an an- 
chovy, or a radish — a plaything, in short), to pass the 
time. Tlien, three dislies, one after the other, wliich 
really constitute the substance of the dinner ; but, in 
Paris, fish counts as a dish, and vegetables (cauliflowers, 
pease, or asparagus, for instance) are a dish. Then, 
either an ice, a heignet (fritter), an omelette soufflee, or 
other kickshaw; and, finally, a trifle of dessert, and a 
glass of liqueur. Wine, at discretion, is taken with tlie 
meal. In France, it is the height of orthodoxy to com- 
mence a dejeuner or a dinner with oystere, wliich are 
eaten before tlie soup, and are hardly considered to form 
part of the meal. 

Now, to apply these principles to a dinner-party : 
First, every guest will have a bill of fare beside his plates 
that he may make his selection. There may be two 
kuids of soup, suited to the season, to choose from ; as 
julienne and tapioca in summer, and ox-tail and mock or 
real turtle in cold weather ; or, at any time, a white and 
a brown soup, or a tliin soup and a mouthful soup. 



BILLS OF FARE. 713 

The Iwrs d'omvres will be disposed up aiid down the 
table^ adding to its ornamentation, and inviting a trial. 

Two kinds of fish, with their appropriate sauces, will 
suffice. Tliis mode allows small fish to be served; as 
their selection need not be principally guided by tlie 
appearance they will make top and bottom. 

Bemembering that a private entertainment may be 
more liberally supplied than a low-priced restaurant 
dinner can be, there may be four or five kinds of flesh 
dishes, quite moderate-sized joints (whether of beef, veal, 
mutton, lamb, })Oultry, or game), each with a fitting 
accompaniment of vegetable (as we eat vegetables with 
our meat), and some scribed white and some brown. Of 
course, a servant is ready with salad, for those who 
choose to eat it with the roast. 

Then, a choice of two or three sweets, intended for 
the ladies rather than the gentlemen ; and then, the 
standing and fixed dessert 

Celery will be a liors d^oeuvre to go witli the cheese ; 
which may be taken either English fashion, between 
dinner and dessert, or may form part of the dessert itself, 
as is the custom in France. 

The wines must depend on the entertainer's gener- 
osity, the wealtli of his cellar, and the taste of his guests. 

No one can call such a dinner cither extravagant or 
a bad one, if well cooked and well served. It may bo 
varied greatly, without increasing either its cost or its 
cumbrousness. Its scale is enough, and not too much : 
and its remains will not tax the family's digestive powers. 
Good waiting is of the utmost necessity. 



714 B1LIJ3 OF FABS. 

A writer in the Times would introdaoe a sixnibr 
principle of simplification into those magnificent meases, 
the Lord Mayor's dinners; which, he says, are reaDj 
Tery bad, not creditable to the wealth of the City^ and 
not gratifying to the majority of the visitors. He once 
had to dine ofi^ green pease only, although tempted with 
a long list of things which it was impossible to obtain. 
The Lord Mayor's guests would be in the same predica- 
ment as the First Napoleon's— obliged to eat a hearty 
dinner before going out to dine, through want of victaak 
in one case, as through want of time in the other ; fi>r 
the Emperor, on state occasions, remained at taUe 
thirty minutes, neither more nor less ; at ordinajy din- 
ners, fifteen minutes only* 

The correspondent of the Times advised the CSiy 
Committee for Lord Mayor's Day to imitate the pablic 
dinners given at the Hotel de Yille of Paris. Let 
ihem provide a complete dinner for a party of eight; 
namely, the turtle and another soup; the tnrbot and 
another fish ; two entries ; the venison and roast beef; the 
sweets and the ices. Let them avoid the riot and nn- 
certainty of a hundred other dishes named in a menu; 
and, sticking to these, multiply them by the number of 
parties of eight invited. Let them also insist that each 
set of waiters attend only to their own party of eight, 
and not wander ofi^ to distant Common Councilmen with 
the prime cuts of turbot and venison. By following this 
simple method, they may inaugurate an epoch of reform 
in civic dinners, which is extremely needed.

what was understood by the word entremets in former 
times. Every thing is served in its turn, and nothing is 
set on the table merely to be looked at. Nevertheless,

A great merit in the above Bills of Fare is, that by 
simply reducing the quantity of the provisions dressed,

they will serve just as well for a dozen persons as ftr t 
couple of hundred. Thej are based on the oommoD- 
sense principle, that the number of guests who parfcakB 
of a dinner should have no influence whatever on the 
number of the different dishes composing it. The 
requisite amount of food is obtained by increasing the 
quantify of the meats already determined upon, and not 
by increasing their variety. The serving of ioes in the 
depth of winter is a qiiestion of fiishion, taste— and 
wholesomeness. 

There is another class of BOls of Fare which merits 
serious consideration ; namely, those recommended to 
families who like a good dinner on Sundajrs and Holi- 
days (acknowledged by the Church as Feast-Dajs), but 
who still wish to occupy the time of those whose duty 
is to serve them as little as possible* A cold Sunday 
dinner suggests itself as the easiest way of meefang the 
difficulty ; but, besides the fact that something hot is 
pleasant, wholesome, and sometimes necessary, during 
great part of the year, in the climate of the United 
Kingdom people cannot live in winter, even in the 
kitchen, without a fire ; and, where there m a fire, it 
would be carrying "an idea" too fiar not to make a 
moderate and reasonable use of it The labour of 
servants can be very much eased by abstaining firom 
dishes which require much Sunday preparation. Cold 
dishes may pleasantly form part of a meal ; they do so 
every day without our noticing the fact, and therefore, 
on Sundays, they may fairly be made to do so with 
a purpose. Few cooks will object to warm up things

ready prepared and easj to manage^ or to do things 
fresh which take little time and give little trouble. The 
cook need not, bj thus consulting her employers* com- 
forts, either neglect her religious duties, or debar 
herself from the sight of her friends. The waiting 
may be simplified by laying the table at an early hour, 
and by ornamenting it, a la RusaCy with every Ihing to 
be eaten cold, removing all (except the dessert) as soon 
as it is done with, and it will then serve for the kitchen 
supper ; for we belong to the school of economists who 
do not give white bread to the master and brown to the 
servant, but feed the whole household on the very same 
joints, only taking the first cut ourselves. In short, 
we would suggest a compromise between the absolutely 
cold Sunday Dinner and the luxurious and elaborate 
Sunday Feast. The hint once given, the housekeeper 
can improve on the miscellaneous samples offered here.

732 COKCLUSIONS, 



xxn. 
CONCLUSIONS. 

AFFECTING SEDENTARY, PROFESSIONAI^ AND 

LITERARY PERSONS. 

There are two kinds of labour^ bodily and mentsl, 
differing widely in their effects on the homan frame. 
There are likewise the same two kinds of exercise ; nsmxAjj 
exercise of the corporeal pow^ers, and exercise of the 
intellectual faculties. By exercise, we mean action of 
any kind voluntarily undertaken, and continued so I<N]g 
only as it is pleasurable, and ceasing the moment a 
person has taken enough of it to his liking ; whereas, 
labour is exertion prolonged, under either physical or 
moral compulsion, for definite periods, not always in 
conformity with the labourer's tastes and wishes, but 
obliged to be continued during those periods, whether 
the pleasurable point has been passed or not. 

The reader will readily call to mind instances of the 
difference between bodily labour and corporeal exercise. 
Galley-slaves were made to toil at the oar, harder and 
longer than was agreeable to their feelings ; boating is 
the act of playing with that implement, to the extent 
which suits the boatman's convenience. It is true that 
in boat-races, and in the preliminary training, exercise, 
taken in excess, may be converted into labour; or, in 



CONCLUSIONS. 733 

other words, you may make a toil of a pleasure, — which 
only renders the distinction more clear. 

The same of mental exercise and labonr. Creatures 
gifted with an intellect cannot let it lie utterly dormant. 
They exercise it, therefore, with animated discussion^ 
interesting inquiries, pleasant projects. Although cheer- 
ful talk will be only an exercise of the tongue and tho 
powers that guide it, an elaborate speech may become a 
real labour. However amusing may be the process of 
observation, research, and speculation, the putting of the 
result on paper in orderly, logical, and producible form 
will often turn out a laborious task. The reader who 
skims through a scientific treatise which gives the most 
recent views of some difficult subject, may be fairly 
said to exercise his mind; while the author, who had to 
write it in a given time, amidst other avocations, with 
facts to discover and conclusions to draw, will probably 
have undergone actual labour. 

It is curious that most people whose experience is 
limited to work executed by the limbs, should feel a 
difficulty in admitting that mental labour is labour at all. 
Who are the objects of envy to the working class? 
Emperors, ministers of state, victorious generals; dis- 
tinguished, popular, and marvellously productive literary 
persons : of whose heavy burdens and ceaseless travail 
they do not entertain the slightest conception. Work 
performed sitting in an easy-chair, and in the tempered 
air and light of a comfortable study, cannot, according 
to their ideas, be allowed to pass as serious work. They 
can see in it nothing but the dolce/ar niente^ the delicious 



i 



734 CONCLUSIONS. 

profession of nothing to do. Monej earned by the pa 
is, with them, synonjnnous with money picked up in tk 
streets. An industrious Parisian refused to believe iisei 
Scribe, the dramatist, had made a large forttine sd^r 
by play-writing ; because, " If he had, every body dse 
would do the same.'' 

On the other hand, nobody holds that bodily labour 
is not labour. Nobody, that can help it, wishes to Utb 
by bodily labour. There are even whole races and 
communities of men, as the Jews, who contrive to escape 
it Fair-weather exercise in moderation, under pleasant 
circumstances, all accept; but manual toil, as a ha- 
bitual, compulsory, and perennial means of livelihood, 
no one. All who do so work, look forward to, and hope 
for, the time when they shall be able to live without it 

And yet ordinary labour (out-door, especially), when 
not excessive, and when wholesome food is obtained in 
sufficient quantity^ is particularly healthfid in its ten- 
dency; for not only does it aid the circulation, and 
apply the great stimulants of au: and light, but it thereby 
insures the proper assimilation of the whole amount of 
aliment that is taken in. For, it cannot be too strongly 
urged, it is not the food eaten, but the food digested, 
which nourishes. Food, however rich, passing away 
undigested and unassimilated, might as well have been 
chaff or chips, for any good the eater derives from it. 

Besides those who labour only with their limbs, and 
those who labour only with tlieir brains, there is a mixed 
and intermediate class, whose professions compel them 
to work with both. Happy are they, perhaps, without 



GONCLUBIONB. 735 

knowing it ; for one kind of labour, one set of influences, 
oorreots the untoward tendencies of the other. Exercise 
of the muscles calms irritation of the nerves, and relieves 
the brain of any undue supply of blood. The stomach 
indirectly profits by it, and performs its functions with 
greater ease. Fresh air, one of the best of calmers, acts 
as a remedy against sleeplessness ; and the sunshine radi-« 
ated from the Orb of Day brings with it sundry other 
influences, which we acknowledge rather from their 
beneficent effects than from what we have yet learnt 
about their nature. Such persons — ^those employed on 
railways, for instance — may be hard worked and much 
exposed ; but, with proper precautions of clothing and 
regimen, their work and their exposure wiD help them 
to enjoy far better health than if their destiny had 
chained them to the accounts of the office or the com- 
positions of the study. 

Convalescents will generally, and wisely, be guided 
in the food they take by their medical adviser; their 
relatives and attendants will see to its being properly 
administered. After the crisis of an illness has passed, 
and the patient has safely got round Danger Comer, 
it ofi»n requires very little to set him going in the right 
way forward ; but it requires that little to be offered at 
the nick of time, and to be repeated, with proper varia- 
tion, at frequent and regular intervals. Friends, in 
their zeal and anxiety, are apt to urge the taking of too 
much nourishment at once; but the grand secret of 
nursing convalescents is, to give them little and often. 
They must not be put too forward, nor be tried beyond 



736 CONCLUSIONS. 

iheir strength in any way — beyond their strength of 
digestion, their strength of bearing sitting up, or their 
strength of attending to serious business. 

Convalescents may take h'ght nourishment with ad- 
vantage early in the morning, as soon as they awake— an 
egg, for instance, beat up with sugar and a little rose- 
water, or even with milk, if the stomach will bear it, and 
perhaps with a bit of sponge cake soaked in it If the 
patient is so weak as still to require watching, a little 
good, warm beef-tea or chicken broth should be ready to 
give, in the case of his waking during the dead of the 
night, when the vital powers are at the very lowest, and 
the great majority of deaths occur. An orange to suck, 
or lemonade to sip, though innutritions, are refreshing 
and antifebrile ; and whatever tends to give tone to the 
system is a step made towards the recovery of strength. 

The effects of easily digested, strengthening food — 
such as light puddings, custard, meat soup, delicate fish 
— ^may be enhanced by serving them with what may be 
caUed "moral sauce;" by contriving agreeable little 
surprises ; by having something sent unexpectedly, the 
moment something is wished for, from the pastry-cookV^ 
as a present from a neighbour, or a token of remembrance 
from a distant friend. The snack (for it should.be no 
more, until strength retiurns) will be still more highly 
relished, if accompanied by a pleasant bit of news, an 
amusing note (which may be caused to bo written), the 
prospect of some desired event about to happen, or some 
object pleasing both to the sight and the spirit, such as 
an early flower or fruit. Even the outside of a new and 



CONCLUSIONS. 737 

interesting book, which must not be read until permission 
is given, will have its beneficial effect. In all these de- 
tails, the instinct of affection will find its way, and will 
surelj work wonders in the end, provided that it care- 
fully remembers that The more Haste, the worse Speed ; 
and that Slow and Steady wins the Bace. 

The dietary for Sedentary Persons cannot be con- 
sidered without dividing them into two widely differing 
classes ; namely, those who have nothing, and those who 
liave something (perhaps a great deal), to do. To the 
former, the simplest advice to be given would be, ^^ Cease 
to be sedentary; be up and stirring." And thankfiil 
would hundreds be could they only follow it. For indo- 
lence is not the sole cause of inactivity. General debility, 
lameness, or other bodily infirmity, keep many at home 
who would otherwise be often abroad and out-of-doors, 
not to mention that fi-equent depression of spirits and 
disinclination to go far firom the house which by no 
means amounts to actual hypochondria or mental disease. 

As a rule, sedentaiy persons should take light, nutri- 
tious food, in quite moderate quantities, at not long 
intervals of time. By eating too heartily or too fre- 
quently, they tire the digestive organs, giving them no 
rest, and indigestion surely follows. On the other hand, 
by fasting too long, the stomach grows faint and weak, 
appetite is gone, less nutriment is taken in, and that little 
less easily digested. Individuals, otherwise similarly 
circumstanced, differ so much in the quantity and fre- 
qnency of meals that suit them, that each person must be, 
in a great measure, guided by his own experience and 

3b 



738 CONCLUSIONS. 

feelings, keeping always on the safe side, by neither mak- 
ing the meals too heavy nor the interval between them 
too long. 

Dr. Edward Smith address^ excellent advice to 
those who lead a sedentary life : " Persons of sedentary 
habits are liable to become either thin, feeble, and dys- 
peptic, or else to grow stout, according as the original 
state of their constitution and the attendant conditions 
of life have led. A certain amount of exertion is neces- 
sary to enable a person to breathe the pure air in sufiS- 
eient quantity to carry on tlie function of digestion and 
other vital actions in activity and vigour ; and when this 
is not obtained, the quantity of food which is supplied 
must be reduced, or fulness of the system, or derange- 
ment of digestion and general health, will follow. If tihe 
reduction of the appetite for, and the digestion of, food be 
greater than the necessary wants of the system can toler- 
ate, the former result occurs ; but if they remain good, 
the system will, at least for a time, store up fat within it, 
and the person will become stout. 

'^ When, with the sedentary occupation, the person 
becomes thin, feeble, and dyspeptic, it is necessary that 
the same plan should be adopted which has been laid 
down for persons of feeble constitution, viz. the frequent 
supplies of small quantities of hot food ; and, as animal 
food excites the vital actions more than vegetable food^ 
it should be preferred, and the quantity of it gradually 
increased. There are many in this state who hesitate 
to take milk and eggs, from having felt uncomfortable 
after their use ; but they should be encouraged to take 



CONCLUSIONS. 739 

them, nevertheless, in the form which is least disagree- 
able to their taste. Milk in puddings or with chooolate, 
and eggs fried or made into herb omelettes, are the best 
forms of food. Meat is not objected to ; but care in its 
cooking and flavonring, and variety of meat (exdnding 
pork, and perhaps veal and fish), are necessary. Meat 
should be eaten twice a day ; and, at the tea meal, potted 
meats, ham, or eggs, should be added. Curries are 
valuable, and all the meat should be hot, fresh, and sea- 
soned. So long as the sedentary habit is continued, the 
total quantity of food which is supplied should be less 
than would be requisite imder other conditions ; but it 
should be largely of an animal nature. It will, however, 
often be necessary to seek the medical adviser, in order 
to keep the functions of the body in a state as consistent 
with health as may be possible ; and, abpve all things, 
arrangements should be made by which exertion of some- 
what a severe kind may be taken at one or more regu- 
lated periods daily, and thus obviate the ill efiects of the 
sedentary occupation." — Practical Dietary. 

Unoccupied sedentaries have a great advantage over 
those who have their living to get, in this : they can take 
a substantial midday meal or dinner, accompanied by a 
moderate dose of fermented beverage, both which the 
others are obliged to abstain from — if for no other reason, 
for fear of the flagging attention, or even drowsiness, 
which such indulgence is apt to induce. They cannot, 
in fact, really dine, though they may call it dinner. 
They make a light meal) often without meat or even eggs; 
their beverage is water, or tea or coffee, which suits 



740 C0NCLIT6I0NS. 

them better then than at a later period of the day, the 
wakeftdness it causes being now advantageous — ^the con- 
trary to what it would be at night. Such persons, to 
keep up their strength, must make up at an early sup- 
per (or late dinner) for the sparing allowance taken at 
dinner or luncheon. They will then entirely abstain 
from tea and coffee, and make good, sound beer or wine- 
and-water, with perhaps a glass of wine pure, their 
beverage. This moderate amount of stimulant will calm 
the nerves and conduce to sleep, especially if they can 
screw out the time for a little out-door exercise before 
their evening meal. An hour's walk, even in the dark, 
or in ihe rain with an umbrella and a cloak, will wonder- 
fully freshen the spirits, sharpen the appetite, and aid the 
digestion. 

Sedentary persons will, of course, attend to the 
regularity of the more obvious fimctions of their frame ; 
they are specially urged to take great care to keep up the 
action of their skin. Because the insensible transpiration 
escapes our notice, it is not the less important to healtli. 
It carries off, unconsciously and without our notice, what 
would otherwise soon produce disease. Persons still 
ignorant of the important pai*t which the Skin plays in 
the animal economy, cannot do better than study atten- 
tively the late Dr. Andrew Combe's admirable Principles 
of Physiology applied to Health and Educaiunu There 
they will learn the close relations which exist between 
the Skin, the Lungs, and the Bowels ; how one acts upon, 
relieves, assists, or deranges the functions of the other. 
There is little doubt that Dr. Ck)mbe's valuable but pre- 



CONCLUSIONS, 741 

carious life was prolonged by due attention to the func- 
tions of the skin, and the whole of what he has so clearly 
written on this subject is particularly worthy of serious 
study. 

Sedentary persons, debarred fjrom throwing off noxious 
particles from their frame by the free action of the lungs 
and skin induced by out-door exercise, should therefore 
keep the latter in full play by the daily use of sponge- 
baths, cold or tepid. If the warm reaction does not 
speedily follow the application of cold water to the sur- 
face of their body, after it is well dried and rubbed, it 
will, in that case, be more prudent to make use of tepid. 
In very severe winter weather, the sponge-bath need not 
be employed more than every other day, or thrice a 
week, but never less than twice a week by persons lead- 
ing a sedentar}'' life. This simple, cleanly, and whole- 
some measure will often save them from attacks of gout, 
irritation of the lungs, dysentery, offensive breath, and 
feverish colds, which result from the disturbance of the 
balance of the natural secretions. When the skin fails 
to do its work, other organs have to do the work for it ; 
and they do do it at first, but not so well ; because, as 
disobliging servants say, "it is not their place." By 
continuing to do it, their powers are overtaxed, and 
various disorders of the system are the necessary conse- 
quence* It is scarcely possible to exaggerate the import- 
ance of keeping the skin in proper action; and this, in 
persons enjoying moderate health, may be nearly insured 
by the daily use of the sponge-bath and proper clothing. 

There have been medical men who, assuming that 



742 CONCLUSIONS, 

the cause or principle of gout is of an acid nature, have 
prescribed alkaline baths — i,e. hot water with washer- 
woman's soda dissolved in it — as a remedy, or, rather, a 
prophylactic And the results, gouty patients say, have 
been favourable. We ourselves, with some personal 
experience of the matter, doubt much whether the alkali 
has the special effect attributed to it In the first place, 
it is not proved that gout consists in an acid humour ; 
it may not be a humour, nor even an entity at all ; like 
heat, it may merely be a mode of motion — a form of 
inflammatory action; in which case, there being no 
acid to neutralise, the alkali cannot combine with what 
does not exist. But, as the addition of soda renders 
water smooth and soft, and more efficacious in its cleans^- 
inff efiects, there is little doubt that water so prepared 
makes an excellent bath,^-especially for persons who do 
not use sponge-baths frequently. And that we hold to 
be the probable explanation of the fact, if it be one. 

As to persons who, like the modem Bomans, are 
washed from head to foot twice only during their sojourn 
on earth, — ^as soon as they are bom, and after their 
death, — ^the wonder is they are so well as they are. 
When such persons, by accident, do get a bath, the 
removal of their crust of dirt feels to them like the 
loss of an article of clothing. But sedentary persons 
especially ought to observe the strictest cleanliness ; not 
only with regard to what meets iStie view, but throughout 
the whole surface of their bodily frame. Like the Indian, 
although in another sense, they should consider them- 
selves as ^^ all face.*' 



CONCLUSIONS. 743 

Many hold that sedentary people will help their 
digestion by taking only a very limited quantity of 
flaid ; this is true, so far as that they expend less floid 
than persons much in the open air. During out-door 
exercise in warm weather, or with dry winds blowing, 
the evaporation is considerable; and the sensation of 
thirst is providentially given to warn us to supply the 
loss. But abstinence from liquids must not be carried 
too far, even by the most stay-at-home individual. 
Enough drink must be taken during the twenty-four 
hours to allow of a sufficient secretion from the kidneys : 
it is through them that the waste of animal food and 
the worn-out material of the tissues are mainly elimin- 
ated from the body ; and if, through a deficient supply 
of fluid, the drainage of the system, by their agency, is 
imperfect, the germs of disorder will accumulate until 
ihey manifest their presence by producing illness. Nature 
and common sense will mostly indicate the extent to 
which thirst may be allayed. 

Professional persons are placed in such various con- 
ditions, that it is not easy to speak of them in general 
terms ; one circumstance, however, is common to them, 
— ^want of time for repose and refreshment, and full 
employment of their time during the middle of the day, 
t. e. the greater part of the morning, and all the after- 
noon. This points to the desirableness of making a 
breakfast which shall be nutritious without being heavy, 
and concentrated in substance rather than bulky in mass. 
It may include eggs, delicate bacon, mutton or lamb 
chops, cold meat pie, kidneys, cold fowl, game, or any 



744 CONCLUSIONS. 

first-rate, delicate, and not greasy fish. Beef, hbt or cold, 
is too heavy at breakfast for persons whose brains want 
to retain all their energies instead of lending a part of 
them to help the stomach to do its work. Fruit, pre- 
seryes, or marmalade (except as adjuncts), are not suffi- 
ciently nutritious. Scotch break&sts are too substantial ^ 
for our climate, except for persons who spend the morn- 
ing out of doors, — they are apt to induce a feeUng of 
drowsiness, until their digestion is three -parts com- 
pleted. The French d^jeCtner a la fourchette is both too 
heavy, and is eaten at too late an hour, to suit pro- 
fessional persons in England. It approaches too nearly 
to a hot lunch, and is partaken of all the more freely 
from not having been preceded by a breakfast Where 
every body (professional and business men included) takes 
his d^eCiner a la fourchette^ or dines at noon, the custom 
may bo complied with without inconvenience; but, in 
England, such a serious sit-down meal, at such an hoar, 
is difficult for busy people to take. It involves a loss of 
time which they can ill afford ; and it often brings on 
(especially if fermented liquors are taken with it) a list- 
lessness and a disinclination to work, the struggle with 
which causes a painftd effort It raises, in fact, tlie 
important question of Luncheon for Professional and 
Business People. 

Busy men, in short, rpust dine late : they are obliged 
to take their principal meal after the brunt of their work 
Is over. They cannot breakfast very substantially ; they 
cannot lunch or dine with their wives and children at one 
o'clock; what, then, are they to do to support nature 



CONCLUSIONS. 745 

daring that long interval ? For, without some refresh- 
ment containing moTQfood than the cnstomaiy biscuit 
and glass of sheny, the constitution must eventually 
suffer. 

" There are many merchants' and banking houses,*' 
says Dr. Edward Smith, "where no opportunity is 
allowed to the clerks or salesmen to take food until five 
or six o'clock at night This seems to me a most 
tyrannical exercise of power, and one which I have 
known to exert the most prejudicial influence over the 
health of young men. A certain interval, however small, 
should be allowed for dinner ; and facilities for obtaining 
suitable food should be afforded. If, however, the clerk 
so circumstanced will provide himself daily with a cold 
meat pie, or with meat sandwiches, and milk, which he 
may perhaps be able to warm, he may find opportunity 
to eat them, and thus make a moderately good dinner." 

Again : " The absence of a good midday meal, in the 
case of business men, is founded upon the want of facility 
for obtaining it, or of time in which to eat it, or on the 
sense of imfitness for clear thought which follows it ; but 
it is contrary to reason that health can be uniformly 
maintained at its highest pitch when, after an early 
breakfast, there is continued and close application to 
business until from four to six p.m., without relaxation, 
and almost without food. We have copied the French 
habit of late dining, but have omitted its essential accom- 
paniment — ^the substantial ddjedner a la fourchette, 

" The objection which may be fairly taken against 
late dinners is veiy greatly lessened if a sufficiently good

lanch be eaten in ihe middle of the day. All such persons 
shonld take at least meat and bread as a lonch : the 
former to the extent of three ounces, in the form of 
sandwiches or otherwisey accompanied by a glass of wine 
(if that be usually taken), or simply by water, and that 
restricted to the smallest quantity which is consistent 
with a sense of ease during digestion. If the labour 
which is to follow be rather bodily than mental, it would 
be better to take a hot chop, or a supply of other hot 
meat, with bread, and perhaps a potato, so as to make 
the meal somewhat as valuable as a dinner.'^ 

The very best midday refreshment for busy people, 
with the least possible interruption of their pursuiis, is a 
basin of good soup : such as canaommd, with vermicelli 
or maccaroni, mock-turtle, ox-tail, ^blet, or mouthiul 
pease soup (which see). All these combine the advan- 
tages of being hot, of taking little time to eat, and of 
containing much nutriment in a small bulk, with some- 
times a little of the vinous element, combined in such 
moderate proportion as to sustain without exciting or 
troubling the intellectual powers. Bread may be soaked 
in any of the above. If they cause thirst, it may be 
allayed with a wine-glass of toast-and-water, or a litde 
cold tea. 

Another speedily despatched and simple hot luncheon 
may be made off a couple of soft-boiled eggs and bread- 
and-butter, with a cup of savoury mutton broth, beef- 
tea, or any good stock broth as the beverage. But indis- 
pensable refreshment has often to be taken in places 
where there is no fire and no kitchen to cook or warm 



CONCLUSIONS. 747 

up lihe simplest article of food. In that case, the pro- 
fessional worker most fall back on sandwiches containing 
plenty of meat, with a fair proportion of fitt, nicely seasoned, 
or made with a combination of salt and fresh meat, such 
as salt beef and fowl, veal and ham, mutton and tongue, 
pork and sliced sausage. For variety, a piece out of a cold 
cairs-head pie, with a roll, will serve ; or a cold roast 
fowl cut up into small joints, and accompanied by bread 
and a pinch of salt screwed up in a paper. The latter 
affords an excellent snack in respect to the substance of 
which it consists, but has the disadvantage of requiring 
either a knife and fork and plate, or to be picked with 
the fingers, neither of which are permissible under many 
circumstances when support is needed. 

When broth, or otlier warm unfermented drink, is 
not to be had, one of the nicest afternoon beverages for 
busy-minded people is cold tea, ready sugared and milked, 
and carried in a pint bottle. It is a great favoarite on 
such occasions with many sportsmen, who find that even 
the small quantity of alcohol contained in a glass of ale or 
porter affects their quickness of sight and surety of aim. 
Soda-water (plain, without wine or brandy) answers 
well, but has the reputation of having a lowering ten- 
dency; effervescent lemonade is too sweet and syrupy; 
ginger beer (when not too gingered) is better than 
either. Theory would obviously recommend milk for 
such occasions ; but many adult stomachs cannot bear it 
even when boiled, finding it heavy, indigestible, and the 
cause of thirst, — as is also frequently the case with French 
caf4 au laity or boiled milk and strong cofiee mixed 



748 CONCLUSIONS. 

together in equal proportions, or with a preponderance 
of the milk. Milk, too, does not carry well, turn- 
ing sour in summer, and separating itself from the 
cream in all weathers. Cold, weak tea will be found 
to have few superiors for the purpose now under con- 
sideration. 

After a hard working day, sustained by refreshment, 
a hearty but not a heavy dinner, nutritious and well- 
seasoned, with not too many dishes, may be fairly allowed 
as a recompense for the labour undergone, supposing that 
no mental work has to be done in the evening. But if the 
brain has still two or three hours' occupation before it, 
then for the dinner it will be prudent to substitute a meat- 
tea, not more substantial than is necessary to prevent 
exhaustion ; and, after the work is over, to take a light 
supper, with beer, ale, wine-and-water, or other accus- 
tomed stimulant, in moderation. By this arrangement, 
the strength will be sustained, and sleeplessness (often 
caused by the recent activity of the brain) will be avoided. 
There is no reason why a few Tlhiffs of a cigar should not 
be afterwards resorted to as a further tranquilliser, if in 
accordance with the person's habits. 

Busy people often get an indigestion by eating too 
fast; in vulgar phrase, they "bolt" their food, without 
masticating, and almost without tasting it. They are 
wrong to read letters or newspapers at meal-times, which 
call off their attention from the still more important act 
of repairing the waste of their bodily and intellectual 
energies. As their time for refreshment is limited, they 
should never have to wait for their meals, w^liich ought

to be ready at the minute.* It is better they should eat 
in company, and that, of com*se, agreeable company. 
The remarks they hear, as well as those they make, will 
prolong the process of tasting and swallowing. fTo con- 
siderate wife or child will select the family table as the 
place to communicate unpleasant news, dilate on griev- 
ances, or make complaints, however reasonable. Some 
other opportunity will be chosen. It is the interest of 
the family, as it ought to be, and mostly is, their wish, 
that the mainstay of the household should enjoy his hasiy 
meals with cheerfulness and peace of mind. 

Professional persons who are fully employed cannot 
afford to reduce themselves by any depletive or weaken- 
ing course of diet or medicine. They have need to 
husband all their energies for the Ailfilment of their 
heavy duties. If at any time their system seems to 
require a little lowering, it is wonderful how surely and 
speedily that is effected by mere abstinence for a day or 
two from the usual allowance of fermented beverage or 
meat The simple act of continuing to live incessantly 
wastes the stock of material in hand ; much more must 
such be the case when exertion of mind and body are 
superadded. In the great majority of instances, deple-

tive and cathartic treatment may be believed to be a 
mistake ; for what, after all, is life or vitality bat the 
manifestation of aocumnlated strength? and what is 
death, but the result of weakness fallen to an extreme 
degree? What is the maintenance of life, but the 
sustaining, the keeping vpy of the vital powers? All 
forms of bleeding, therefore, all violent purgiog, all 
extraordinary abstinence, should be refrained from, and 
never permitted but on those exceptional occasions when 
the physician's orders are paramount. 

Professional persons, especially, will do well, for 
their own sakes, to study the Tonic Treatment of Disease, 
as insisted on by Mr. Skey.* He is' not alone in object- 
ing strenuously to that system of medicine which seems 
to regard the liver as the most pestilent member of the 
human frame, needing constantly to be assisted by blue 
pills and black draughts. But few medical men have 
insisted so long and so perseveringly on the worthless- 
ness of drugs as compared with food as a means of cure ; 
for the tonics which Mr. Skey so strongly recommends 
are curative rather as food than as medicine. They 
supply a want in the bodily ^stem, just as wine supplies 
it ; and, in fact, wine is the chief of the tonics which 
Mr. Skey recommends. ^^I consider wine," he says^ 
^^ indispensable to the tonic treatment of disease.'* 

The theory on which Mr. Skey proceeds is this : If 
we inquire into the recent history of any one suffering

CONCLUSIONS. 751 

from illness, whatever form it may assmne, we shall 
hear of something tending to reduce the vital powers of 
the body, and to cause exhaustion of some sort There 
is always a loss — it may be of blood, or of food, or of 
heat, or of sleep ; and the method of cure must consist 
in making up for the loss. ^^ I consider the treatment 
of the great majority of diseases," says Mr. Skey, "to 
consist in increasing the quantity of healthy blood and 
giving force to the action of the heart. You cavHt^'* he 
continues, and the italics are his own, — " Ycm carUt cure 
disease with a feeble pulse. Mend the pulse, and nature 
will do the rest of the work." He accordingly brings 
forward a number of examples to show how disease is 
produced by exhaustion, and is thrown off when the 
animal economy is properly supported. 

For instance, he states that the late Mr. Jones, of 
Jersey, was a remarkably successfril operator ; in opera- 
tions for the excision of diseased joints, he succeeded in 
a series of five-and-tweuty cases without the loss of a 
single patient, at a time when in England the mortality 
in similar cases was very great, recovery being rather the 
exception than the rule. What was the secret of this ? 
On making the inquiry, it was discovered that Mr. 
Jones invariably gave every patient on whom he operated 
at least a pint of port wine on each of the two days fol- 
lowing the operation; and he acknowledged that he 
learnt the treatment, which had been followed by such 
remarkable results, from his observation of the success 
which had attended Mr. Skey's practice in St Bartholo- 
mew's Hospital. 



752 CONOLtTBIONS. 

What has been said of Professional applies with still 
greater force to Literary Persons, ^peciallj when the 
latter are rapid producers of original literature. Authors, 
male and female, might enjoy excellent health, their 
original constitution permitting; there is nothing in 
their pursuits themselves to prevent it; only, in their 
zeal and industry, they are often tempted to cany what 
is really good to an excess which then becomes per- 
nicious. For the mind is not the body's enemy, but quite 
the contrary. A well-regulated activity of the brain is 
communicated through the nerves to all the organs, and 
aids them in the performance of their functions. 

It is not by leaving the central force in idleness that 
we can hope to acquire stronger or steadier health. 
During sleep, while the brain is taking its rest, even 
the vital functions of nutrition are somewhat slackened. 
Absolute immobility of that organ finally terminates in 
death. It is expedient, therefore, or, rather, necessary, 
to exercise it : but it must not be distressed or over- 
worked. Any exertion of the brain which is either too 
violent or too long-continued, by concentrating the 
forces of the system on one single point, reduces the rest 
of the organism to a state of languor. The natural equi- 
librium is disturbed ; sensibility is no longer distributed 
according to the requirements of the vital processes; and 
the animal economy soon falls into fits of alternate pro- 
stration and over-excitement. Eveiy intellectual excess 
will tell, in tlie end, on the bodily firame. The process of 
giving out heat and light is also a consuming process. 

One of the first to call attention to these &cts was 



CONCLUSIONS. 753 

Tissot, a medical practitioner at Lausanne, while 
Bonsseau and Voltaire were residing there, and who, 
therefore, witnessed the morhid melancholy of the one, 
and the convulsive irritability of the other. In the 
eighteenth century, whoever could wield a pen looked 
upon himself as if armed with a sword. Men of letters 
formed a body militant, who claimed the privileges of tlie 
victorious soldier, despising constraint, and giving them- 
selves up to the reckless pursuit of both intellectual and 
sensual pleasures. The double license soon bore its 
fruit; mental diseases increased in frequency, and 
deranged health was the almost certain consequence of 
the intemperate cultivation of literature and science. 
Tissot, believing that it was time to remind literary per- 
sons of certain prudential and hygienic rules, made them 
the subject of the inaugural discourse with which he took 
possession of his Professor's Chair at the Academy of 
Lausanne, on the 9th of April 1766. Tliis discourse 
(originally written in Latin), after several enlargements 
and modifications, has finally taken its place as a standard 
work under the title oiDe la SantS dea Gens de Lettres — 
« On the Health of Men and Women of Letters." The 
greater part of its contents is as valuable now as when 
first written. Li these days we think it strange that he 
should have been reproached with lowering the dignity 
of science by making it comprehensible to the multitude. 
But he had no thought of rendering his readers indepen- 
dent of the physician's advice; he merely wished to 
enable them to avoid imprudence and errors leading to 
evils beyond the physician's power to cure.

754 CONCLUSIONS. 

The maladies of literaiy persons arise from two prin- 
cipal causes; namely, long-sustained labours of the 
mind, and continual repose of the bodily firame. Wha 
the intellect is at work, the organs of the brain are moce 
or less in movement, under a greater or less strain ; iho66 
efforts and movements fatigue the brain ; after a long and 
difficult meditation, it is as much exhausted as a robmfc 
person is by violent exercise. Whoever has ihou^ 
deeply, only once in his life, must have made the experi- 
ment in his own person; and there is not a man of letters 
who has not sometimes left his study with a hot head 
aching violently. The marks of fatigue are seen in bis 
eyes ; and if we look at a man plunged in meditation, 
we observe that the muscles of his face are tightlj 
stretched, and sometimes almost in convulsion. Eiik- 
Patrick, who translated Tissot's work into English 
(London, 1769), says in his preface, " I knew a gentle- 
man of very active mind, who, whenever he was thinking 
deeply, had all the fibres of his forehead and of a part of 
his face as visibly agitated as the strings of a harpsichord 
when it is played upon with spirit" 

Tissot then quotes a fragment to the purpose from 
the Adventurer (Vol. L No. 2) : " The multitude who 
live by bodily toil, imagine that study does not fiitigue; 
they are greatly mistaken. Thought is real labour^ 
which is not less fatiguing than tha^.of the ploughman 
or the artisan, without enjoying its advantages. Tb^ 
latter gives health, strength, cheerfulness, easy slambers, 
a good appetite; whereas the effects of studious and 
sedentary habits are disorders which poison and shorten 



OOKOLUSIOKS. 755 

life, prevent sleep, impair the appetite, and cause con- 
tinual anxiety." 

Whenever the brain is exhausted by mental labour, 
tiie nerves necessarily suffer ; their derangement brings 
;about the derangement of health, and the constitution 
is gradually injured without the presence of any other 
influence* ^^ Many, like myself, may have experienced," 
says Bonnet, ^^that long thought weakens the organs 
of sight ; if the organs of hearing do not manifest the 
same weariness, it is doubtless because they are less 
delicate." 

The brain, which is, so to speak, the theatre of war ; 
ihe nerves, which branch off from it ; and the stomach, 
which contains many vezy sensitive nerves,— are the 
organs which usually suffer the soonest and tibe most 
from excessive intellectual labour : but there is no organ 
which does not feel the consequence, if the cause con- 
tinues too long in action. These facts are particularly 
observable when young persons are forced to undue 
application while their growth still is incomplete. 
Children of great promise, compelled to study without 
intermission, have broken down, and died, or become 
epileptic for life. 

The derangements of the brain, brought on by in- 
ordinate intellectual exertion, are the consequences of 
three laws which govern the animal economy : 

First When the mindy by long-continued toUj has 
excited the brain to an unduly powerful degree of activity ^ 
it is no longer able to repress that activity. The excitement 
oontinues in spite of itself; and, reacting upon itself, 



756 CONCLUSIONS. 

causes it to entertain ideas which are trolj delirious, 
because thej no longer answer to the impressions pro* 
duced bj external objects, but to the internal condition 
of the brain, a portion of which has become incapable of 
receiving the communications transmitted to it hj the 
senses. This maxim, fiill of physiological truth, givea 
us the real theory of dreams and mental alienation in 
one of its essential forms. It explains the hallucinations 
and the tendency to insanity which often follow violent 
emotions, absorbing sorrows, over-weening self-esteem, 
passionate love, excessive religious fimaticLsm, and dra* 
matic events occurring in real life, as well as intemperate 
addiction to scientific pursuits. Thus, SpineUo, having 
to paint the Fall of the EebeUious Angels, became so 
absorbed in the portrait he gave to Lucifer, that he could 
never afterwards banish it firom his mind. During the 
rest of his life he &ncied that the demon was constantly 
in Iiis presence, venting his anger at having been repre- 
sented so hideous and so terrible. Space alone prevents 
our citing many other like instances. 

The obvious means of avoiding such a state are, as 
soon as over-excitement or over- weariness of mind begins 
to be felt^— or, with hard-worked brains, whenever an 
opportunity occurs — ^to take a spell of rest, never mind 
how short It will be, as it were, a lull in the tempest, 
allowing the waves to subside and the winds to calm. 
It will be a check to the ever-accelerated velocity with 
which the train of ideas would otherwise run on. 

Happy are the busy brains which can thus bring 
their own activity to a stand-still ; for when the mind

has once been taken possession of by one absorbing idea, 
it is often in vain that friends advise us, and that we 
resolve ourselves, to " think no more about it" There 
it is, preventing sleep, and driving out every other 
thought When the down-hill impetus has once been 
given, it is in vain to whistle to the stone to stop. 

It is said that the late Duke of Wellington through 
the course of his Peninsular campaigns, and the present 
Lord Brougham during the busiest part of his career, 
enjoyed the faculty of being able to say, " I will sleep 
for twenty minutes, or for half an hour ;" and that, at 
the end of that interval of repose, they would wake up, 
giants refreshed. This habit may have been at least 
one of the causes which enabled those valiant veterans 
to retain their strength and clearness of intellect, the 
one to a good, the other to extreme, old age. 

The persons soonest put out of order by mental 
efforts, are those who are ceaselessly occupied by a 
single object; in their case, only one portion of the 
sensorium is strained, and that portion is always on 
the stretch. No repose is afforded to it by others being 
called into action; it is wearied and worn out all the 
sooner. In the bodily frame, when a single muscle, or 
a limited group of muscles, is made to work incessantly, 
the constitution suffers considerably more than if the 
same amount of action were successively shared by all 
the muscles. The case is precisely the same with the 
brain. When its different portions are called into action 
one after the other, it suffers much less fatigue; the 
portions which rest regain their strength, whilst the

others are performing work. This plan of ** Beat, and

health. It is well expressed in the homely proTcA: 
** Change of work is as good as play."

While the brain is at work, it receiyes an additional 
quantity of blood, which, causing too great a tensibn and 
motion in the vessels, produces the sensation of pain and 
heat already mentioned. In short, there arises an inci- 
pient state of determination of blood to the head. 

ZImmermann, the author of the celebrated Essay m 
Solitude^ experienced in his own person the efiects of 
severe mental effort in determining a rush of blood to 
the brain. " Having the day before yesterday been 
requested," he writes to his friend Tissot, " to compose

enough to say to myself, "This is the conseqnence of too 
great a mental strain.' Until noontime, the pain kept 
getting worse and worse. Cream of tartar, very hot 
leg-baths, milk of almonds, and small doses of quinine, 
set me right again." 

A slight irritation of the brain suffices to cause sleep- 
lessness; stronger irritation produces convulsions; carried 
to a still further degree, it brings on apoplexy — a too 
frequent cause of death with literary persons. They 
are punished through the offending member. Study — 
that is, study carried to excess, and not the due and 
regular exercise of the brain — weakens that organ to 
such an extent as to bring on hypochondria, childish- 
ness, imbecility, idiotism, especially when other circum- 
stances concur in driving to it a considerable quantity of 
blood. 

Great preachers and illustrious professors have been 
known to die in the pulpit and the lecture-room, as 
happened at Leipsio to the celebrated Curtius. Livy 
has recorded the story of King Attains, who, exhorting 
the Boeotians to conclude an alliance with the Bomans, 
fell dead in the middle of his speech. Actors have not 
unfrequently expired on the stage, or immediately after 
removal from it : ascetic bigots pronounce such a fate 
to be a "judgment" inflicted on their worldly pro- 
fession ; medical men more wisely refer it to the 
emotions of their part, and the strain on their memories.

The third law, in conseqaence of which excessive 
literary labour becomes the cause of still further dis- 
ease, is, that Animal fibre becomes hardened by exercise. 
The whole bodily man, as he grows older, hardens, 
and old age is a general conversion into horn. With 
workmen, the working members are indurated; wiih 
literary persons, it is the brain that works ; and often 
do they become incapable of connecting their ideas, 
and grow old before their time. In children, the brain 
is still too soft ; in old people, it has grown too hard ; 
and either excess is an equal hindrance to the complete 
exercise of its proper functions. The memory, the first 
to give the signs of failing, presages the weakness of the 
other faculties. 

Over-activity of mind and inaction of body are the 
principal causes of disorder with literary persons ; but 
they are not the only ones. The student's very attitude 
cannot be otherwise than injurious to health. The fold- 
ing and compression which the vessels suffer, in a sitting 
posture, at the upper part of the thigh and beneath the 
knee, impede the circulation in the lower members, one 
of the consequences of which is cold feet and legs. The 
stoog of the body affects the abdominal viscera, and is 
an additional cause of indigestion ; the stomach is doubly 
a sufferer. Hence, not a few literary men have wisely 
performed their work in an erect position, by means 
of a desk at which they can stand and write. A stand- 
ing desk is useftil to have in one's study, if only for the

purpose of varying the disposition of the limbs during a 
spell of work. 

Night-work may be regarded as a fourth exciting 
cause of malady in learned folk. A man who has 
been working during the day, toils much too hard if 
.he continues to work during part of the night. The 
time allowed for sleep is unduly shortened, and is 
insufficient to repair the previous wear and tear. More- 
over, the sleep which follows long-continued exertion is 
never calm and tranquil It does not produce the effect 
it ought, because the brain continues in a state of excite- 
ment It is found impossible to break the thread of 
thought ; the over-weary labourer cannot sleep, or if he 
do, it is a state of half-asleep and half-awake, during 
the course of which restless ideas increase fatigue 
without rendering service. The ancients were weU 
aware of the danger. Asinius PoUio, consul and 
orator, who was the first in Rome to collect a library, 
was so conscious of the risk of evening studies, that he 
would not even read his letters after the tenth hour, 
that is, two hours before sunset 

Of all the functions, when once disordered, sleep is 
the most difficult to reestablish. "We lose it gaily ; we 
lament it bitterly, and almost always uselessly. 

Bespecting Those who labour in the nighty and rest 
during the day^ as readers, compositors, and others en- 
gaged in printing-offices, and many other noctumally 
exercised professions, Dr. Edward Smith remarks: 
*^ There is much diversity in the plans pursued by dif- 
ferent persons of the same class, some of which are, I

think, prejudicial to health. The proper plan is to take 
a good dinner almost immediately before going to duty, 
as, for example, from 4 to 6 p.m., and a good meat supper 
about midnight A small breakfast should then be taken 
on leaving the office and before going to bed, and a good 
breakfast, similar to the French d^eikier ct la fourchettej 
on rising, at from 12 to 2 o'clock. There will thus be 
three good meals taken during the 24 hours, and the 
body will be sustained by nourishment at the period when 
exertion is made, and when the human system is at its 
lowest point of vigour." 

It is dangerous for literary persons who are no longer 
young to apply themselves abruptly to sciences different 
from those which they had hitherto cultivated. The new 
ideas which occupy their attention cannot do otherwise 
than disturb the system of nervous persons. An able 
theologian absolutely ruined his health by renouncing 
his usual studies in order to learn Hebrew ; and a respect* 
able parish priest, promoted to a theological professorship 
at the age of fifty, fell into a state of debility which 
brought him to the grave, in consequence of his endea- 
vours to fulfil the duties of his new vocation. 

If a changed course of study is injurious to persons 
of mature age, continuing to labour is not less so when 
advanced age has been attained. We all remember the 
sad results of Sir Walter Scott's working when he should 
have worked no longer ; and Southey was another suf* 
ferer from not resting when he ought to have rested.

Panatltenasi at the age of ninety-four, and lived to 
ninety-eight. 

Our soul is unquestionably immortal ; but, so long as 
it is united to the body, it follows the latter's destiny ; it 
seems to be bom, to gather strength, and to grow old 
together with it The diminution of our corporeal forces 
is a warning to diminish our intellectual labours ; the one 
can no more support the same amount of study, than the 
other can bear the same weight of burden ; the mental 
fiumlties are weakened, as well as the muscular strength. 
Few old people seem to be aware of this truth ; some will 
not even bear to have it mentioned ; all are, in this re- 
spect, Archbishops of Gi*enada. But the truth is not the 
less real for that ; and those who moderate their toil in 
proportion as their age advances, take the steps most 
likely to prevent infirmities and insure continued health. 
Voltaire, who wrote at eighty with all the fire and gaiety 
of thirty, is probably a unique example. 

It is the &shion, now, for head-workers to seek a 
renovation of their health and strength in an annual ex- 
cursion or tiip, during which they are exposed to phy- 
sical conditions greatly differing from those of their usual 
life ; and it may often be questioned whether the change 
be not both too severe and too sudden. It may be 
doubted whether exhausting walks are the best restora- 
tives for hard-worked professional men, who have been 
pent in cities for the ten months previous. The change 
is too abrupt and too complete to be healthy. Conti-

of relaxation) are, for snch persons, like exposing a

Remembering the delicacj of the human organism, com* 
bined with the powerful effect of habit, it is evident that, 
in oanying oat this plan, great precaution is requisite, 
both in respect to clothing and diet In the first place, 
the transition should be made as gradnallj as time and 
circumstances permit; the immense change should be 
softened as much as possible ; and there are efforts and 
degrees of endurance which no wise man, however 
strong, would expose himself to make, without a certain 
amount of previous training. 

Persons unaccustomed to behold the sun once a day 
(often not once a week), and living within walls and 
under an atmospheric canopj which cut off nearly all 
radiation from themselves, are abruptly plunged into 
£oods of sunshine, and exposed to an amount of radiation 
firom without and from within, which they never felt 
before in their lives. They rush into showers of sun^ 
beams, and other influences darted out by our great 
luminary, while they incur sudden losses of animal 
heat unknown to their city experience. Jt cannot 
be a very salutary tonic to be roasted at one end, and 
iced at the other. The effects of the cooking are 
visible in the noses and lips they bring down to tho 
valley. 

When either of these radiations are excessive, the 
results are &tal. Sunstrokes are produced by radiation 
from the sun ; moon-blindness is caused by the chill on

an accompaniment to the clearness of the atmosphere. 
Against these nnaccustomed influences, prudential mea-* 
sures are to be sought in various modes of protection — 
in double-lined umbrellas, used as parasols; in veils, 
various wraps, and general clothing warm rather than 
flimsy in its texture. The Turk and the Arab wear thick 
turbans, to keep their heads cooL 

Michelet, speaking of the beneficial effects of change 
of air,* says : " Transitions, especially, ought to be 
made with great caution. 

" Can we, without preparation, without some modi* 
fication of living and regimen, be abruptly transferred 
firom a completely inland climate (Paris, Lyons, or 
Dijon) to a sea-side climate ? Can we, until we have 
breathed the sea-air for a considerable time, begin taking 
sea-baths ? Can we, without some habituation of pru- 
dent hydrotherapy commenced inland, brave, in the open 
air, the nervous constriction, the horripilation, caused by 
eold water, which sticks to you as you try to get out of 
it, and often with a high wind blowing? These pre- 
liminary questions will more and more attract the atten- 
tion of medical men. 

" The extreme rapidity of railway travelling is an 
antimedical circumstance. To go, as we do, in twenty 
hours from Paris to the Mediterranean, traversing dif- 
ferent climates from hour to hour, is the most imprudent 
act in the world for a nervous person to commit You

^^When Madame de S^vigne took a month to go 
fix>m Brittany to Provence, she passed gradually and by 
cantious stages through the violent opposition of those 
two climates. She proceeded insensibly firom the western 
to the eastern maritime zone, and thence to the inland 
climate of Burgundy. Then, slowly following the Upper 
Bhone into Dauphiny, she confronted with less difficulty 
the high winds of Valence and Avignon. Finally, 
resting for a while at Aix, in inland Provence, away 
from the Bhone and from the coast, she became a natu- 
ralised Provengale, as far as breathing and the chest 
were concerned. Then, and then only, she encountered 
the Mediterranean.'*

Whenever pedestrian travel is in view, great care 
should be paid to the management of the feet Every 
intending pedestrian ought to take serious thought liow 
he means to be shod; for it is not enough merely to 
have something between the stones and the soles of your 
feet A doggrel philosopher has enunciated the axiom, 
that "Without feet, you can't have toes;" we may 
carry the truism frurther, and assert that without good 
walking toes and feet, you can't walk. But sedentary 
people are apt to forget that there are two sorts of human 
fset : &et to walk with, and feet to sit still with. We

treat our sedentary feet at home exactly as they should 
be treated, by carrying out the golden rule to keep the 
head cool and the feet warm. But walking feet must be 
otlierwise managed ; they must be kept cool and dry : 
hence, partly, the pedestrian exploits performed by nude- 
footed people, as the Scotch and the Arabs. Thick 
stoddngB, which enoourage, and boote, highlows, or 
bottiMSj which confine, moisture, are bad. At the end 
of a long summer-day's journey, you will have your 
feet tender, sodden, half-skinned, approaching the con- 
dition of an overboiled fowl ; for which misfortune (when 
it occurs), the best remedy is to enclose your toes and 
the parts affected in a linen rag soaked in brandy and 
olive-oil, before drawing on your stockings. Wear thin 
socks or stockings of finest wool, and thick-soled shoes, 
cut low rather than high, and already worn before start- 
ing. If you must have gaiters, to keep out gravel and 
bits of stick, let them be of brown-hoUand or hempen 
•doth, or at least of some material not impervious to 
vapour. 

Li starting for an eminence whence a view is to be 
admired, take with you a woollen comforter and a flannel 
under-shirt ; an overcoat also is a wise precaution. Tou 
arrive perspiring at the top; you immediately change 
your wet flannel for dry. If the air is keen, as mostly 
happens, you don the additional outer clothing, and 
onjoy your panorama in comfort and safety. These and 
other useful items will go into a little hand-bag, ^easily 
carried by deputy if not convenient to do it yourself.

be safely indulged within moderate bounds. The di- 
gestive powers partake of the stimulus which travel 
applies to the whole economy. Indigestion connected in 
any way with hypochondria is often forgotten ; and such 
indigestion, forgotten, is cured for the time. A more 
substantial breakfast than that usually taken at home is 
required by most constitutions, while making a ped^* 
trian tour especially, or one which involves much exercise 
on foot. The foreign fashion of drinking wine-and-water 
at breakfast may be even adopted with advantage by 
many whom it would render uncomfortable at home. 
Extra fatigue requires extra restoratives; and a man's 
appetite for meat and drink is very different amongst the 
Alps to what it is in a city counting-house.* His after-

authority : 

''As great activity of body leads to g^at waste of the structures of 
the body and to the rapid destruction of food, it is necessary that it be 
followed by a large amount of food ; and as it is usually accompanied 
by a good appetite, an abundant supply may be taken at each meal. 
The increase should be of all kinds of food alike, both animal and 
vegetable, particularly of meat, fat, bread, and fresh vegetables ; but 
the amount of fluid which is taken should be increased in a less degree. 

''Thus, to one who makes much bodily, or bodily and mental, 
exertion during the day, as in hunting or campaigning, the following 
quantity of food daily would not be excessive : Cooked meat, 8 ob. ; 
bacon, 4 os. ; butter, 2 oz. ; sugar, 2 oz. ; cheese, 2 oz. ; besides 
one or more eggs and the less important foods which enter into a 
daily dietary. Soldiers and sailors, in time of active service, obtain 
from lib. to l^lb. of uncooked meat; and as they do not have the 
variety of food just enumerated, and cannot thoroughly cook their 
food, so large a quantity is no doubt necessary.'* — Dr. Edward Smith's

hours' work. 

Persons retoming from active ont-door to in-door 
sedentary habits, most at once return to their usual 
clothing and their usual diet, under pain of serious 
functional derangement. If thej can again make the 
transition gradual, so much the better. They must 
again keep their head cool and their feet warm. Again 
must they breakfast lightly, lunch lightly, eat at all 
times with great moderation, and reserve what fermented 
bevera£;e they take, as far as may be. for a nifi:ht-cap. If. 
at firstf their travelling appetite Jemins, ihey must obsti^ 
nately persist in refusing to gratify it ; their frame has no 
longer a call for such liberal supplies of nourishment as 
it lately had. If their appetite flag, they need not be 
uneasy on that account. It is no sign of failing health, 
but the contrary ; being simply a notice that the expen- 
diture of their corporeal system is less. When only a 
moderate fire is required to be kept up, a moderate supply 
of fuel suffices. The same reasons explain why young men 
who have just completed their growth, and have entered on 
a life of in-door application, ought not to be surprised if 
their appetite is no longer what it was during the days 
of their boyhood. Their future health will be all the 
better in consequence of its moderated vigour. 

The first difficulty to be overcome with literary per- 
sons, when their health is in question, is to get them to 
believe that they can possibly be in the wrong. They 
are like lovers, who fly into a passion if you venture to 
hint that the object of their aflections has a fault. Warn

often nothing but labour in vain. They deceive them- 
selves in a hundred different ways. One reckons on 
the strength of his constitution ; another, on the force of 
habit ; a third hopes to escape punishment, because he 
has not yet been punished ; while a fourth relies on ik 
example of others, which has nothing at all to dowiA 
his case. All resist the phjsician^s advice with id 
obstinacy which they mistake for firmness, of whick 
they are proud, and to which they fell victims. It nuy 
be stated generally that literary persons are the most; 
di£Scult of all patients to manage ; and for that yery 
reason it is our duty to enlighten them respecting the 
means of preserving and reestablishing their health. 

The first preservative, without which all other help is 
useless, is to allow the mind sufficient relaxation. Indeed, 
it is often during relaxation that the happiest ideas sug- 
gest themselves. A country walk or drive will often ky 
the foundation, or supply the substance, of a successful 
work. The mind is expanded in the open air, while the 
narrow walls of a study contract it. Gcsner, the German 
poet, wrote his best compositions in a summer-house in 
the midst of a garden. The beneficial influence of the 
open air is still further enhanced when combined witi 
moderate exercise. The two united refresh the system, 
help the circulation, favour transpiration, vivify thfl 
nerves, and strengthen every member.

in his study, he feels his head heavy, his eyes inflamed, 
his mouth and lips dry ; a certain imeasiness oppresses

the chesty with a slight tension at the pit of the stomach ; 
he is more inclined to ennui );han to cheerfulness; he 
sleeps less sonndlj, and feels a weight and a numbness 
in every limb. Khe continues to shut himself up, these 
adverse symptoms go on increasing, until serious dis- 
order is the result. Two or three hours in the country 
would dissipate them completely, and restore serenity, 
freshness, and vigour. 

Literary people are scarcely enough aware of the 
influence of the body on the mind ; and yet great 
geniuses have been convinced of the fact, and have 
admitted that the mind, as well as the body, must 
submit to the laws of medicine. ^' The soul,'' said 
Descartes, ^' is so dependent on the temperament and 
disposition of the bodily organs, that if it were possible 
to discover a means of increasing our penetration, it 
is through medicine that we should have to seek iV* 
Every literary person ought, therefore, strictly to 
devote at least an hour or two daily to exercise ; 
which Boerhaave advised to be taken before dinner. 
Walking has its advantages ; but the best of all exercise 
is riding on horseback. 

It is very important, nevertheless, not to take strong 
exercise immediately after a meal. Digestion is neither 
the fermentation, nor the dissolution, nor the trituration 
of food, but an operation partaking of all the three, 
which requires quiet for its due performance. It needs 
the assistance of the nerves, and sufiSars if they are other- 
wise employed by violent exertion. The food should not 
be shaken about in the stomach ; because the shaking 



772 CONCLUSIOKB. 

continually distarbs the digestive process already com- 
menced. For this reason, of all exercise immediately 
after meals, trotting on horseback is the veiy worst. 

Literary persons should pay attention both to the 
selection of their food, and to its qnantiiy. Errors in 
either respect produce bad consequences ; but, of the two, 
it is better to make an injudicious choice than to exceed 
a due allowance as to quantity. 

Improper aliments are: All fat and greasy things, 
which ftirther relax the fibres of the stomach, deaden the 
action of the saliva and the gastric juice, and occasion 
uneasiness in the stomach, in consequence of the slowness 
with which they are digested. 

All viscous, pasty, glutinous things act nearly in the 
same way as greasy things. Amongst these are included 
fried things, pancakes, fritters, creams, the feet of animals, 
&c ; certain fish, — as eels, skate, cuttle-fish, <&c. 

All meats which are either hard naturally, or are 
hardened by salting and smoking, on which a weak 
digestion acts too slowly, — rest a long time in the 
stomach, and Irritate it by their weight and their acrid 
qualities. Pork, sucking-pig, ducks and geese, are not 
usually aliments adapted to the digestive powers of 
sedentary, convalescent, or literary persons. 

Their most proper aliments consist of: The young and 
tender meat of the animals which are usually sent to 
table ; scaly fish, whose flesh is firm and delicate, whether 
from the sea, the river, or the lake ; the cereal grains, 
such as the difierent varieties of wheat, rye, barley, oats, 
and rice ; those vegetables which are neither too laxative 



CONCLUSIONS. 773 

nor too acid ; most of the common garden-roots, which, 
besides their farinaceous elements, contain a proportion 
of sugar and flavouring matters, whose effects are very 
beneficial; bread, which is the common basis of the 
food of every civilised nation; eggs; milk; well-ripened 
fruits. 

Meat should be eaten either roasted or cooked in a 
very small quantity of water ; when boiled in a large 
quantity of fluid, many of its nutritious particles go into 
the brotL Tender beef, good veal, mutton fed in dry 
pastures, chicken, capons (when not too fat), guinea- 
fowl, young partridges, and leverets, are the properest 
meats for delicate persons, and to which, perhaps, they 
would do right in confining themselves. Fish is never 
more wholesome than when it is boiled. 

Fresh eggs, uncooked or very slightly boiled in the 
shell, are a mild aliment, which does not irritate, which 
is very nutritious, and is easily digested; but if not 
fresh, they are imwholesome, and if boiled hard, indi- 
gestible. Eggs are good for persons subject to acidity 
in the stomach. Those who cannot digest the entire 
substance of an egg, will derive benefit from taking the 
white only, which is the more easy of digestion, and 
affords considerable support to weak constitutions. 

In the choice of food, precautions have to be taken 
which cannot be laid down in general rules, but which 
every body ought to discover for himself, by observing 
what things suit and what disagree with him. Some 
people digest meat more easily than vegetables, which 
cause a disagreeable sensation at the pit of their stomach; 



774 00NCLU8I0NS. 

whilst others find them lighter than meat, being leas 
liable to cause sleeplessness and feverish symptoma. 
Some literary persons feel acidity after eating bread, so 
that they are obliged to restrict themselves to a very 
small quantity. Milk does not suit every body, and 
eggs disagree with many people, without its being pos- 
sible to assign a reason. In short, in respect to food, it is 
absolutely necessary to consult each individual stomach. 

Men of letters (which includes women of letters), like 
Augustus Caesar and all other delicate persons, cannot 
bear severe cold, nor great heats, which try them sorely, 
because it is more difficult to protect one's self against 
them than against cold. Milton, in summer, used to 
fall into a state of prostration which bordered on intel- 
lectual dulness. Less illustrious instances are &r firom 
rare. Severe cold irritates the nerves, and produces 
even worse efi*ects on nervous persons. Titerati and 
literatsB should take care to avoid extremes. It is not 
always in their power to choose their place of residence ; 
the country, with its pure air, and the clear thoughts it 
inspires, is not always a convenient home for men of 
letters, whom many circumstances compel to live in 
cities ; but at least a healthy dwelling may be found, 
with lofty ceilings, well lighted and well ventilated, ex- 
posed to the summer breeze and the winter sunshine, 
and with no source of noisome smeU or exhalation in the 
neighbourhood. 

Gold feet, to which people are exposed who continue 
motionless for long intervals at a distance firom the fire,

ness in the head, pains in the throat and chest, and ob- 
stinate colds; thej check the natural transpiration, 
disturb the digestion, occasion violent colics, and pre- 
vent sleep. Scientific men, who had vainly sought sleep 
bj the use of potent anodynes (for them almost always a 
dangerous remedy), have found it by obeying the re- 
commendation to warm the soles of their feet every night 
before the fire, before going to bed, even to the point of 
feeling pain. A bottle of hot water applied to the feet 
in bed, is another excellent remedy. With literary 
people, the blood has such a tendency to rush to the 
head, that no means should be neglected of preventing 
that accident. Some, to continue their work a little 
longer, tie a napkin dipped in cold water round their 
head ; it is a dangerous experiment, which they will be 
wise to refrain from ; but they are right in keeping their 
head habitually either slightly covered or not at all, and 
to wash it in cold water every morning, unless the hair 
be an obstacle. 

On feeling the head suddenly oppressed and heated, 
the best thing to do is to remain for some moments per- 
fectly motionless, not even attempting to speak ; after- 
wards, to take a little cold water, and avoid all mental 
application for several hours. 

For the same reason, studious persons should avoid 
taking an after-dinner nap, which has a tendency to 
accumulate blood in the head. If it is an old habit, or 
cannot be resisted, the slumber should be made as short 
as possible, in imitation of Augustus, who, when he took 
a short repose, covered his feet and put his hand before

In. general, literaiy persons should avoid all sorts of liga- 
tures as much as possible ; thej are injurious to every 
body, by checking the course of the circulation, and the 
injuiy they do increases in proportion as the circula- 
ti<Hi is feeble. It is very important to do literary work 
in loose habiliments, which cause no compression, and do 
not pretend to ^' fit,'' like the dresses in which people 
present themselves in society. '

OPINIONS OF THE PRESS. 

" The most systematic and valuable work upon water supply hitherto produced in 
English, or in any other language." — Engineer (first notice). 

''^Mr. number's work is characterised almost throughout by an exhaustiveness 
much more distinctive of French and German than of English technical treatises."-^ 
£nein€er (third notice). 

''We can congratulate Mr. Humber on having been able to give so laige an 
amoimt of information on a subject so important as the water supply of cities and 
toMms. The plates, fifty in number, are mostly drawings of executed works, and 
alone would have commanded the attention of evtry engineer whose fNactiw may U«

gravings, 30 J., cloth. 

" It is the only practical treatise on the great art of tunnelling. Mr. Clark's work 
brings the exigencies of tunnel entetiuise up to our own time. The great length of 
modem tunnels has led to a new difficulty in the art, which the last generation was 
ignorant of, namely, the difficulty of ventilation. In Mr. Clark's suimTement we find 
tnis branch of the subject has been fully considered. Mr. Claik's aaditlonal chapters 
on the Mont Cenis and St. Gothard Tunnels contain minute and valuable experiences 
and data relating to the method of excavation by compressed air, the heading 
operations, rock-boring machine^, process of enlanement. ventilation in course m 
construction by compressed air, labour and cost, %ic —BKUding News,
