Gentlemen : 

The recipes in The Bride's Cook Book have been 
carefully examined by the Home Economics Depart- 
ment of the United States Food Administration for 
California and found to be in accordance with its 
rulings. 

By following the Wheatless and Sugarless recipes 
contained therein the Housewife is performing a 
patriotic duty in the conserving of Food so necessary 
for our Allies and armies abroad. 

Great appreciation is given to the publishers of 
the book for its construction along the line of Food 
Conservation. 

Yours verly truly, 

UNITED STATES FOOD ADMINISTRATION

Straight Facts 
About Diamonds 

BY ALBERT S. SAMUELS 

895 Market Street 

San Francisco 

THERE are so many grades of color and quality 
in diamonds that nobody except an expert can 
judge their value accurately. 

To insure our customers against the purchase of 
diamonds of inferior quality and color we handle 
only one grade — the finest of "blue-white." When 
you select a diamond here, regardless of size, 
whether you pay $50 or $500, you are sure of a bril- 
liant, fiery blue-white stone. 

For further protection we give a written guar- 
antee — a "money-back" bond offering to refund in 
cash 90 per cent of the purchase price if expert 
examination later influences you to return it. That's 
the way we sell diamonds.

To Make Coffee 'Vood"— Use Good Coffee 




HAVE COFFEE POT THOROUGHLY CLEANED DAILY. 
USB A TABLESPOONFUL COFFEE FOR EACH CUP AND ONE FOR THE POT. 

Follow any one of these 

THREE METHODS 

Boiling or Brewing Method — A 

Use coffee ground medium. Pour boiling water on required 
amount of coffee in order to bring out the richness and 
strength. Let simmer slowly for fifteen minutes. 

Percolating Method — B 

Use finely ground coffee. After the water begins bubbling 
over the coffee let continue so, percolating slowly from 
fifteen to twenty minutes until the rich, brown color and 
strength of the coffee are finally brought out. 

^ Filtration Method — C 

Place coffee, ground very finely or pulverized, in bag sus- 
pended in coee pot and pass the required amount of boil- 
ing water. 

The filtration method is the quickest way to make coffee 
but a great deal of care must be given to the bag. It 
should at all times be kept absolutely clean and sweet. A 
good method to adopt is to start with a new bag every 

Sunday morning and immediately after using the bag should be thoroughly 

cleaned in hot water and kept in a jar of fresh, cold water. 

Do not use soap in cleaning the bag. 

N. B. — Boiling water must be 212 o. 

Keep the brew hot. Chilling the brew destroys the affiliation of oils and 

water and therefore the flavor. 





Our steel cut process used in grinding coffee eliminates the hitter chaff, 

and the result is

Housekeeping Notes 



CLEANING THE HOUSE 

CARE OF THE KITCHEN FLOOR. A linoleum covered floor is the 
most easily kept clean. The hardwood floor is the next best. Any- 
thing spilled should be wiped up at once. Grease-spots on wood or 
stone should be covered with flour, starch, or powdered chalk to 
absorb the grease. Or if you pour cold water on the grease as soon as 
it is spilled, to harden it, the greater part may then be scraped off. 
Sweep the floor thoroughly once a day. With care it will not need 
washing or scrubbing oftener than once a week. 

SWEEPING. In sweeping a kitchen, be sure to see that no food is left 
uncovered in the room. Sweep from the edge of the room toward the 
center. Sweep with short strokes, and keep the broom close to the 
floor. Turn it edgewise to clean cracks. Gather the dust in one spot 
and take it up with a short broom and a dust-pan. If possible, burn 
the dust at once. Never sweep from one room to another. 

DUSTING. After sweeping a room, dust the woodwork, furniture, and 
movable articles with a soft cotton cloth. Spread the cloth out and 
gather the dust into it, folding it in as you work. Shake it frequently 
out of the window. In the kitchen where there are no delicate articles 
to be injured by moisture, use a damp cloth. When the room has 
been dusted, wash the cloth and hang it to dry. 

SCRUBBING A FLOOR. Always sweep a floor before washing or 
scrubbing it. Provide two pails of cold or lukewarm water, a stiff 
scrubbing brush, a large soft (but not linty) cloth and any good scour- 
ing soap. Dip the brush in water, and then rub it with sapolio. Look 
for grease spots and take them out first. After the floor has become 
wet you cannot see where they are. Scrub with the grain of the wood, 
doing a few square feet at a time. Dip the cloth in clean water, and 
wash the part that has been scrubbed. Use no more water than you 
need. Wet the cloth again, wring it as dry as you can, and wipe the 
floor. Proceed in this way until the whole floor has been changed. 

CARE OF HARDWOOD FLOOR. Never use water on a hardwood 
floor. Wipe it with a cloth moistened with a very little kerosene — a 
teaspoonful or two to begii^ with, and as much more when that has 
evaporated. Rub hard with another cloth until the wood is perfectly 
dry. Window sills and all hardwood finish should be cleaned in the 
same way. 

CARE OF OIL-CLOTH. Wash oil-cloth with warm water and milk. 
Use one cupful of skim milk to one gallon of water. Wipe dry with a 
clean cloth. 

CLEANING PAINT. Take a little whiting on a clean, damp cloth, and 
rub it on the surface to be cleaned. Take care not to let drops of 
water trickle down the paint. Wash off with a second cloth and clean

water. Wipe dry with a third cloth. Clean a little at a time, leaving 
the cleaned part dry before going on. 

CARE OF SINK. Neglect of sink causes bad odors and attracts water- 
bugs and roaches. Keep it at all times free from scraps. When the 
dishes have been washed, scour it with a good scouring soap. Wipe 
the woodwork and tiling. Wash strainer, soap-dish, and other sink 
utensils. Wash the cloth. Scrub the draining-board and rinse the 
sink. If it is of iron and is to be left for several hours, wipe it dry. 
If rusty, use kerosene, or grease it with mutton-fat or lard, sprinkle 
with lime, and leave over night. 

CARE OF FAUCETS. Clean brass faucets with flannel dipped in vine- 
gar or lemon juice and rub thoroughly with rottenstone and oil, then 
polish with a dry cloth, or apply putz pomade or some similar prep- 
aration; rub it off with another cloth, and polish with a third one. 
If the faucets are greasy, wash them with soap-suds or sal-soda solu- 
tion before using anything else. Nickel faucets and trimmings need 
only to be wiped. 

DISH WASHING 

PREPARATION. Collect all dishes to be washed. Save time and steps 
in clearing off by using a tray to carry dishes from table to sink. (A 
table on casters will do instead of the tray.) As you take the dishes 
from the table, scrape and stack them on the tray. Wheel it to the 
sink and remove the dishes from it directly to the dishpan. Put scraps 
in an earthenware or enamelled dish. Frying-pans and other greasy 
dishes should be wiped with pieces of soft paper. This paper may be 
used for kindling. Or fill them with hot water to which a teaspoonful 
of sal-soda has been added, and let them stand. Dishes that have con- 
tained batter, dough, eggs or any starchy material should be soaked in 
cold water ; dishes that have been used to cook sugar should be soaked 
in hot water. Put all dishes of a kind together ; plates in piles, knives, 
forks, and spoons, laid with handles one way, etc. Place nearest to 
you the dishes to be washed first. Have a clean dry place for clean 
dishes. Make ready two pans, or one if there is a draining-board. 

WASHING. Wash the dishes in the following order: 1, glassware; 
2, silver ; 3, cups and saucers ; 4, plates ; 5, larger dishes ; 6, the cleaner 
articles of kitchenware ; 7, large utensils. This order may have to be 
varied to your circumstances. If you have hot water at hand con- 
stantly, the kitfhen utensils may be washed and put away first, or as 
fast as they are used. Dish-washing need not be an unpleasant task 
if these rules are observed: 1, use hot soapy water; 2, change the 
water frequently; 3, have the dishes free from crumbs and scraps 
before beginning to wash them. Wash all dishes, inside and out, in 
soapy water ; rinse in clear hot water, drain and wipe dry. Use scour- 
ing soap or cleaning powder to remove food that sticks or is burnt on. 
Use a wire dishcloth on ironware, a scrubbing-brush, if necessary, on 
enamelled ware, tinware, and wire strainers. Clean seams in tinware 
and enamelled ware with a wooden skewer.

BRIDE'S COOK BOOK 

SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS. Do not put knife-handles in water. Water 
discolors and cracks ivory and bone handles, and may loosen wooden 
ones. After washing knives, scour them with bath brick. Do not 
wash bread-board or rolling-pin at an iron sink. The iron will leave 
marks on them. Wash them at the table. Be careful noi to wet the 
cogs of a Dover egg-beater. Wash the lower part, and wipe off the 
handles with a damp cloth. Water washes the oil from the cogs, 
making the beater hard to turn. Dry the seams of a double-boiler 
carefully. Do not waste time polishing tins. It is sufficient to have 
them clean and dry. Dip glasses into hot Water, so that they will 
be wet inside and outside at the same time. Silver and glass are 
brightest if wiped directly from clean, hot suds, without being rinsed. 
A damp towel makes dull spoons and glasses. Scald, i. e., rinse with 
boiling water, all vessels that have contained milk. Wash teapot and 
coffee-pot in clean hot water without soap, and wipe dry. Clean the 
spout carefully. Let them stand for awhile with covers off. Wash 
dishpan and rinsing-pan, and wipe dry with a towel, not with the dish- 
cloth. Where running hot water is plentiful, time and towels can be 
saved by placing the dishes as they are washed in a wire rack, rinsing 
them with very hot water, and letting them drain. It is best, if possi- 
ble, to set the rack of dishes for a minute into a pan or sink full of 
scalding hot water. Wipe glasses and silver. China and other ware 
will need only a polish with towel or strip of paper towelling. For 
success with this method, the dishes must be washed in clean hot 
suds, and rinsed quickly. If washed in greasy water, or allowed to 
cool before being rinsed, they will not dry clean. Caution: gold- 
decorated china should not be washed in this way. Very hot water 
may injure it. 

REMOVAL OF TARNISH. Acids dissolve tarnish. Oxalic acid, lemon- 
juice, and vinegar may be used. But, except for spots, it is best to rely 
mostly upon powders in cleaning metals. A chemical that removes 
the tarnish may attack the metal. For example, any chemical that 
brightens zinc, eats into it. If acid is used on any metal, all traces of 
it must be removed by rubbing with powder, or the tarnish will quickly 
reappear. Oil or water, mixed with the powder, forms a paste easy to 
apply. Use chamois-skin or soft cloth for polishing. 

TO SCOUR STEEL KNIVES. Scrape off a little bath brick with the 
back of the knife or with an old knife. Dip a cork in water or oil, 
and then in the brick-dust. Hold the knife firmly, with the blade rest- 
ing flat upon a level surface, and rub both sides of the blade with the 
cork. Wash the knife. Scour steel forks in the same way. Never 
scour silver-plated knives or forks. 

CARE OF ALUMINUM WARE. Aluminum should not be used for 
vegetables with strong acid or for boiling eggs. These discolor it. 
Otherwise it needs little care. Never use soda on aluminum. Before 
using any polish fill with water and bring to a boil. For bad stains 
use oxalic acid diluted, one teaspoonful of acid to two quarts of water. 
If the stain still remains, rub with a damp cloth dipped in whiting or 
Dutch cleanser.

BRIDE'S COOK BOOK 

TO CLEAN SILVERWARE. The quickest way to brighten silver is by 
electroylsis, that is, by decomposing the tarnish by electricity. One 
device for this purpose is an aluminurn pan with cross-bars of tin on 
the bottom. Fill the pan with water, and for every quart dissolve in it 
one teaspoonful of baking-soda and one tablespoonful of salt. The 
silver must rest on the bars and be covered with the solution. A mild 
current of electricity is set up which causes the tarnish quickly to dis- 
appear. No rubbing is needed, but embossed silver may need brushing 
to loosen the tarnish. Rinse in clear water, and wipe dry with a soft 
cloth. The old way is to moisten a soft cloth with water or alcohol, 
dip it in fine whiting, and apply to the silver. When the whiting has 
dried, rub it off with another soft cloth, and polish with chamois-skin. 
To cleanse chasing or ornamental work, use an old tooth-brush. Rub 
egg-stained spoons and other badly tarnished articles with salt before 
washing them. The tarnish is not soluble, but with the chlorine in 
the salt it forms a soluble compound. Powders or cakes sold by silver- 
smiths are good. Patent powders and polishes often remove some of 
the silver. 

REMOVAL OF STAINS. 

BLOOD. Saturate the stained part with kerosene oil and then dip in boil- 
ing water. 

CHOCOLATE. L Stretch the stained part over a bowl and pour boiling 
water through it. 2. Rub with pure glycerine, then wash in soft 
water. Do not use soap, as this will fix the stain. 

COFFEE. Proceed as for Chocolate. 

CANDLE WAX (COLORED). Place blotting paper, French chalk or 
white talcum powder on each side of stain and apply a warm iron. 
Brush out chalk or powder and remove color by sponging with alcohol 
or ether. 

FRUIT. Use boiling water and salts of lemon, or boiling water and oxalic 
acid. Pour through stained part which is stretched over a bowl. 

GRASS. 1. Soak the stain in alcohol and rub. 2. Wet with cold water 
and rub cream of tartar in well, then wash out. 

GREASE. Stretch stained part over a firm pad of towelling or other 
absorbent goods and rub with any of the following applied with woolen 
cloth : Turpentine, benzine, ether or chloroform. 

INK. Dampen in cold water, dip in a solution of boiling Oxalic acid (two 
teaspoonfuls oxalic acid in one glass of water), rinse and wash in soap 
solution. 

IRON RUST. Moisten stain with ammonia, then apply salts of lemon 
or oxalic acid ; ^fter effervescence appears, dip in boiling water. 

MUCUS (HANDKERCHIEFS). Soak in salt water (two tablespoonfuls 
to one quart water), wash out and boil.

MACHINE OIL. 1. Soak in cold water, then wash out with soap. 
2. Soak in cold water and borax, then wash. 

MEAT JUICE. Proceed as for blood. 

MILK. Wash in cold water, then warm water and soap. 

PERSPIRATION. Immerse in soap solution and set in sunshine for sev- 
eral hours. 

SCORCH. Soft water and strong sunshine will remove a slight scorch. 

SHOE STAINS ON WHITE STOCKINGS. Soak in a solution of oxalic 
acid, then wash out in ammonia water. 

TEA. Cover stain with common salt, cover with lemon juice and set in 
sunshine. 

VASELINE. Place two thicknesses of blotting paper beneath stain, and 
moisten with benzine. Cover with two thicknesses of blotting p'aper 
and press with a warm — not hot — iron. Use care in working with 
benzine as it is inflammable. 

EGG. Cold water followed by hot water and soap as in ordinary launder- 
ing. 

ICE CREAM. Sponge the stains thoroughly with water, followed by 
agents used in removing grease spots. 

IODINE. Unstarched Materials: Sponge the stain with diluted am- 
monia. Then sponge with alcohol. Starched Materials: Soak the 
stains in diluted ammonia until they disappear, or boil the stained 
material for five or ten minutes. 

LEATHER. Use an abundance of soap with thorough rubbing and pro- 
ceed as in ordinary laundering. 

PAINTS. Sponge the stains with pure turpentine. If stains are not fresh, 
soften by moistening with ammonia and sprinkling with turpentine. 
Roll articles up for fifteen minutes, then wash in warm water and 
soap. 

WATER COLOR. Dip stained portion in gasoline and rub vigorously. 

SALAD DRESSING. Soap and luke warm water for washable materials. 

SOOT. First brush the stain, then place on absorbent powders such as 
Fuller's earth, French chalk, cornstarch, corn meal or salt; work 
around until they become soiled and brush them away. Then wash 
or sponge the stain. 

TOMATO STAIN. Wash stains carefully, then moisten with lemon 
juice and expose to sun for several days. Sponge the stain with alco- 
hol which removes the green part of the stain. This is good for stains 
on wool or silk.

RULES FOR HOUSEHOLDERS. 

The United States Food Administration asks you to comply strictly 
with the following rules. 

Owing to the constant changes in the Food situation these rules must 
be revised from time to time. You are requested to note such revisions 
in the daily press, and to conform to them. 

The recipes and directions contained in this book have been compiled 
for the purpose of helping you to conform to these new food situations 
patriotically and easily. 

ALL KINDS OF FOOD SHOULD BE ECONOMICALLY USED. 

HOARDING: NO FOOD SHOULD BE HOARDED. Hoarding is 

the holding, contracting or arranging for food by any per- 
son in excess of his reasonable requirements for use or 
consumption by himself and dependents for a reasonable 
time. This does not refer to stocks of home grown vege- 
tables and home canned or preserved fruits. 
WHEAT: All householders who can possibly do so should entire- 

ly ELIMINATE THE USE OF WHEAT. 

Householders who are obliged to use wheat should not 
use more than a total of I1/2 pounds of wheat flour or 
prepared wheat, in any form, per person per week. This 
includes wheat flour in Victory Bread, and the wheat 
flour or prepared wheat in crackers, pastry, macaroni, 
breakfast or other foods. 

Victory Bread is bread manufactured by bakers under 
the rules of the United States Food Administration. In 
estimating flour consumption, 1^ pounds of Victory 
Bread may be considered equal to 1 pound of wheat flour. 

In buying wheat flour an equal weight of other cereals 
as substitutes for wHeat flour must be bought pound for 
pound. This is the 50-50 Rule. In buying mixed flours, 
the substitutes in them may be counted so that a smaller 
proportion of substitutes may be bought with these flours 
than with white flour. In buying graham and whole 
wheat flours (containing not less than 95 per cent of the 
entire wheat) 6/10 pounds of substitutes shall be pur- 
chased with every pound of such flours. 

WHEAT FLOUR SUBSTITUTES are HOMINY, 
CORN GRITS, CORNMEAL, CORN FLOUR, EDI- 
BLE CORNSTARCH, BARLEY FLOUR, ROLLED 
OATS, OATMEAL, RICE, RICE FLOUR, BUCK- 
WHEAT FLOUR, POTATO FLOUR, SWEET 
POTATO FLOUR, SOYA BEAN FLOUR, AND 
FETERITA FLOUR AND MEALS. 

Householders in towns and cities may not buy more 
than ^ of a barrel of flour at any one time. Householders 
in the country may not buy more than ^ of a barrel of 
flour at any one time.

RECIPES FOR THE USE OF 

Winto Condensed Tomatoes 

Made from selected whole ripe tomatoes only. 

SPANISH BEANS. 

Soak two large cups pink beans over night. Put them on to boil with one 
can WINTO CONDENSED TOMATOES, two quarts water, one large onion 
sliced, a piece of salt pork about one inch thick, or a small cup of olive oil, one 
teaspoon chili powder, a dash of red pepper, and salt to taste. Cook slowly for 
several hours, adding more water if necessary. Stir occasionally. When done, 
add Vz cup grated cheese. (Long cooking greatly improves the flavor.) 

TOMATO JELLY SALAD. 

Dissolve l^ box of gelatine in V2 cup of cold water. Boil together for fifteen 
minutes % can WINTO CONDENSED TOMATOES, 3 cups water, Vs onion, a 
little celery or celery stock, % teaspoon salt. Season also with cayenne pepper, 
sage, and thyme if desired. Remove from fire, add W^. tablespoons vinegar, and 
the softened gelatin. Strain, and pour into moulds to harden. When firm, re- 
move from moulds and serve on crisp lettuce leaves with mayonnaise or boiled 
salad dressing. When beginning to set, a cup of chopped celery or green peas 
may be added. This amount makes about six portions. 

CRAB A LA LOUIS 

Pick one large can of crab or a fresh crab, season with salt and pepper. Beat 
one ^^^ stiff and add olive oil slowly until one cup has been used. If this does 
not make enough dressing add more oil. However, always add oil before your 
ingredients or dressing will not thicken. Put in juice of one lemon, quarter tea- 
spoon mustard, Worcestershire sauce, salt and pepper, and one teaspoonful of 
Winto Condensed Tomatoes. Shred %-cup lettuce, mix with crab, using a small 
amount of olive oil. Pour dressing over it and garnish with hard boiled q^^. 

Suggestions For the General Use of 
WINTO BRAND CONDENSED TOMATOES 

1. A spoonful of Condensed Tomato stirred into a cup of mayonnaise will 
give a delicious tomato flavor. 

2. Meat soup is greatly improved by adding one level teaspoonful Con- 
densed Tomato for each portion. 

3. When preparing beans for baking, additional flavor is gained by using 
two or three teaspoonfuls of Condensed Tomato. 

4. A teaspoonful of Condensed Tomato and a bouillon cube makes a very 
delicious plate of soup. 

5. Condensed Tomato spread between two thin slices of buttered bread makes 
an appetizing sandwich. 

6. Use Condensed Tomato in any way in which you would use strained 
canned tomato. Condensed Tomato, however, is five times the strength of canned 
tomato and should be diluted accordingly.

BRIDE'S COOK BOOK 

No wheat flour or prepared wheat in any form should 
be used for any purpose other than human consumption. 
No wheat fit for human consumption should be used for 
other purposes. 

SUGAR; Householders should not use more than y^ pound of 

sugar per person per week. Householders in cities may 
not buy more than 2 pounds of sugar at any one time. 
Householders in the country may not buy more than 5 
pounds of sugar at any one time. 

In addition to the above, however, sugar may be used 
for home canning, and will be available to the house- 
holder for that purpose upon his signing a certificate 
that such sugar is desired and will be used only for that 
purpose. 

MEATS : Meats of all kinds and poultry and more particularly 

beef, should be most economically used, eliminating all 
waste. Purchases of these products should be restricted 
and the quantity prepared for each meal reduced. 

Consumption of all meats, including poultry, should 
be reduced as nearly as possible to 2 pounds per week per 
person over four years of age. 

MILK: Fresh milk and milk in evaporated and condensed 

form, and cheese, may be liberally used. 

BUTTER: Butter may be used for normal consumption. 

ICE: No more ice should be used than is absolutely neces- 

, sary. 

TO SAVE TRANSPORTATION LOCAL SUP- 
PLIES SHOULD BE GROWN AND USED. 

GUIDE FOR MENU MAKING. 

THE FIVE FOOD GROUPS. Study them. Every food you eat may 
be put into one of these groups. Each one serves a special purpose in 
nourishing your body. You should eat some food from each group daily. 

GROUP I. VEGETABLES AND FRUITS. Eat these freely. 

They contain mineral matter, vegetable acids, and body- 
regulating substances necessary to health. Eat them when 
they are in season. Eat local products. They are cheaper 
and fresher. 

GROUP IL MEAT AND MEAT SUBSTITUTES. They help 

build up the growing body and renew used-up parts. Ex- 
cept in the case of milk, which should be used in large 
quantities for children, the amount required is not large. 
The United States Food Administration asks you to 
Save — pork, ham, bacon, beef, and mutton. 
USE — milk, eggs, fish, cheese, nuts, beans, peas, pea- 
nuts, soya beans, poultry and game. 

GROUP III. CEREALS AND OTHER STARCHES. These act as 

fuel to keep you warm and to let you do work. They also 



SAN FRANCISCO. SECTION 2 



21 



BRIDE'S COOK BOOK 

give your body some building material. They are the most 
economical fuel foods. 

The United States Food Administration asks you to 
Save — wheat, whole wheat, graham, rye, white breads. 
Victory breads, crackers, wheat breakfast foods, wheat 
pancake flour, white flour cakes, macaroni. 

US]£ — corn, barley, rice, oats, hominy, soy bean prod- 
ucts, 100 per cent substitute breads, cornstarch, tapioca, 
Irish potatoes, sweet potatoes. 

GROUP IV. SUGAR, SYRUPS, JELLY, HONEY, etc. These foods 

supply fuel to the body, and add flavor to foods. They are, 
however, used in much too large quantities. Sweet fruits 
contain much sugar and are better for us than candy. 

The United States Food Administration asks you to 

Save — cane sugar, brown sugar, beet sugar. 

USE — molasses, syrups, honey, preserved fruits, jellies, 
jams, maple sugar, grape sugar, corn sugar, corn syrup, and 
maple syrup. 

Use also the natural sugars found in raisins, figs, dates, 
prunes, dried fruits and cocoanuts. 

GROUP V. FATS. Fat is fuel. It is needed by hard-working 

people. Remember that expensive fats are no better fuel 
than cheap ones. Use drippings. Don't let the butcher 
keep the trimmings from your meat. They belong to you. 
Children need butter fat. Give it to them in plenty of 
whole milk or in butter. v 

The United States Food Administration asks you to 
Save — animal fats (bacon, ham, salt pork, lard). 
USE — vegetable fats, (olive oil, corn oil, cottonseed oil, 
oleomargarine, etc.). Fats trimmed from meats, drippings, 
top milk for cream, and butter in moderation. 

THE SERVING OF WINES. 

Appetizer — Dry, pale sherry, .plain or with a dash of bitters; ver- 
mouth ; or a cocktail. 

With Oysters — Rhine wine. Moselle, dry Sauternes, Chablis, or Capri 
(cool). 

With Soups — Sherry or Madeira (cool). 

With Fish — Sauternes, Chablis, Rhine wine, Mouselle or Capri (cool). 

With Entrees — Claret or Chianti (temperature of room). 

With Roast — Claret, Burgundy or Chianti (temperature of room). 

With Game — Champagne (cold), old vintage champagne (cool). 

With Pastry — Madeira (cool). 

With Cheese — Port (temperature of room). 

With Fruit — Tokay, Malaga or Muscat (temperature of room). 

With Coffee — Brandy or Cordial (temperature of room). 

If you do not wish to serve such a variety, use the following, viz. : 
Either Sherry, or Sherry and Bitters, A^ermouth, or a cocktail as an appe- 
tizer ; either Rhine wine. Moselle, Sauternes, Chablis or Capri with oysters 
and fish. .

DIRECTIONS FOR FOLLOWING RECIPES. 

HOW TO MEASURE. 

Correct measurements are absolutely essential to obtain good results. 
Good judgment, with experience, has taught some to measure by sight; 
but the majority of people need definite guides. 

Tin, granite-ware, and glass measuring-cups, divided in quarters or 
thirds, holding one half-pint, and tea- and tablespoons of regulation sizes,— 
and a case knife, are necessary for correct measurements. 

MEASURING DRY INGREDIENTS. 

A tablespoonful is measured level. A teaspoonful is measured level. 
A cupful is measured level. To measure tea- or tablespoonful, dip the spoon 
in the ingredient, fill, lift, and level with a knife, the sharp edge of knife 
being toward tip of spoon. Divide with knife lengthwise of spoon, for a 
half-spoonful ; divide halves crosswise for quarters, and quarters crosswise 
for eighths. Less than one-eighth of a teaspoonful is considered a few 
grains. To measure a cupful put in the ingredient by spoonfuls or from a 
scoop, round slightly, and level with a case knife, care being taken not to 
shake the cup. 

Flour, meal, powdered and confectioners' sugar, and soda should be 
sifted before measuring. Mustard and baking powder, from standing in 
boxes, settle, therefore should be stirred to lighten; salt frequently lumps, 
and these lumps should be broken. 

MEASURING LIQUIDS. 

A cupful of liquid is all the cup will hold. 

A tea or tablespoonful is all that a teaspoon or tablespoon will hold. 

MEASURING BUTTER, LARD, ETC. 

To measure butter, lard, and other solid fats, pack solidly into cup 
or spoon, and level with a knife. 

When dry ingredients, liquids, and fats are called for in the same 
recipe, measure in the order given, thereby using but one cup. 

3 teaspoonfuls equal 1 tablespoonful 

16 tablespoonfuls of any dry ingredient equals 1 cupful 

12 tablespoonfuls of any liquid equals 1 cupful 

2 cupfuls of any liquid equals 1 pint 

4 cupfuls of any liquid equals 1 quart

BEATEN YEAST BREADS 

CORN BREAD 

V/2 Cups Barley Flour 
1 Cup Corn Meal 
1 Yeast Cake 
Ys Cup Boiling Water 

1 Egg 

2 Tablespoons Syrup 
2 Teaspoons Salt 

Directions: Pour the boiling water 
over the corn meal and allow to cool. 
Add yeast cake, broken and dissolved, in 
a few tablespoons of lukewarm water. 
Then add the egg slightly beaten, the 
syrup and the salt. Beat well. Put in a 
greased bread pan, and when double its 
bulk bake in a moderate oven — ^^15 min- 
utes. 



OAT BREAD 

1 Cup Rolled Oats 

2 Cups Barley Flour 
1 Cup Corn Meal 

1 Yeast Cake 

1 Egg 

% Cup Boiling Water 
1'/4 Cups Milk 

2 Tablespoons Syrup 
2 Teaspoons Salt 

Directions: Scald corn meal with boil- 
ing water. W,hen cool add yeast cake 
dissolved in a few tablespoons of luke- 
warm water. Add the other ingredients, 
leaving the rolled oats until the last. Mix 
well. Put in greased pan and when 
double its bulk bake in moderate oven — 
IS minutes. 

Note: Oat flour or ground rolled oats 
may be used in place of rolled oats, if a 
less coarse bread is desired. 

In making yeast breads without the use 
of wheat or rye flour, it is advisable that 
the dough be handled as little as pos- 
sible. Good results have been obtained 
by the use of eggs and cereals thickened 
by scalding. This method is well adapted 
to corn and oatmeal, but it gives a dough 
too soft to be kneadett. In this case the 
fine grain may be secured by beating 
thoroughly. 

When using conservation flours, the 
smaller the loaf of bread is made the bet- 
ter the result, so it is advisable to bake 
bread mixtures whenever possible in 
muffin or layer cake tins. 



KNEADED YEAST BREADS 

A bread board is not required for these 
about 15 minutes. 

breads. The dough is soft and may be 
cut down and kneaded in the bowl by 
using rice flour on the hands. These 
breads are better when baked in small 
portions or small loaves. 

It is well to moisten the surface with 
milk, or with a mixture made by beating 
the yolk or the white of an egg in one 
tablespoon of cold water. If this is re- 
peated before baking a smooth surface 
will result. 

Stiffly beaten whites of eggs folded 
into the dough before molding gives a 
lighter bread. 

In some of the following recipes the 
dough is not elastic like that of wheat 
breads after the first rising. It resembles 
a thick drop cake batter after the last of 
the flour is added and must be scraped 
from the spoon into the muffin or bread 
pans. It cannot be molded. Moisten and 
set in a warm place to rise, and the dough 
will gradually take the shape of the pans, ^ 
thicken, and rise to double its bulk. 
When baked it has the texture of wheat 
bread and a crisp crust.

Cereal Foods and Flours 



In a bulletin recently issued by the U. S. Department of Agriculture 
will be found this statement: "Cereals supply actual digestible nutrients 
to the body more cheaply than any other class of food except dried legumes 
(beans)." 

It would follow, therefore, that the young housewife should know the 
best methods of preparing Cereal Breakfast Foods. Before giving a list of 
recipes for accomplishing the best results with cereals and flours, the fol- 
lowing table is given to show how economical and valuable cereals are. 
Protein as used in this table is the most important and most expensive 
element in food. A calorie is the amount of strength or energy necessary to 
lift 15 pounds one foot high 200 times. 

Kind of Food Cost per Pound Amount of Energy 

of Protein in 10c Worth 

Rolled Whfat @ 6c $ .68 2505 

Rolled Oats @ 6c 48 2938 

Flour @ 3^c 35 4700 

QDrn Flakes Toasted @ 10c 1.33 1735 

Round Steak @ 16c 87 560 

Leg of Mutton @ 20c 1.37 445 

Roast Pork @ 12c 92 1035 

Eggs @ 24c 1.39 385 

By comparing the above figures it will readily be seen that cereals fur- 
nish by far a greater amount of nutrients than meats. So much so that 
were the source of the facts other than aptual government reports they 
would not be believed. It will be noticed also that of the cereals, Oats fur- 
nishes almost twice as much nourishment for the money as parched Corn 
Flakes. 



SPECIAL RECIPES NOT FOUND ELSEWHERE IN THIS BOOK. 

Rolled Oat Mush 

To two parts of boiling water, salted to taste, slowly stir in one part 
of ALBERS ROLLED OATS and boil for ten to twenty minutes, then 
allow to simmer, stirring occasionally. Serve with sugar and cream. 
Carnation Rolled Oats may be used in place of Albers Rolled Oats. We 
recommend the use of a double boiler, in which case the inner boiler 
should be placed in the outer boiler, in which the water is already boiling, 
after the flakes have been boiling about two minutes. Cook in double 
boiler ten or fifteen minutes more, but do not stir.

Salt 

1 Tablespoon Honey 
2-3 Compressed Yeast Cake, or equivalent 
Buckwheat Flour 

Dissolve salt in the lukewarm water 
until it tastes almost briny. Thoroughly 
mix the yeast cake in the water before 
the flour is added. Mix honey and add 
the flour through a sieve. The batter 
should then be stirred or beaten a long 
time. If any batter is left, it may be set 
away in a cool place, not too tightly cov- 
ered, to take the place of the yeast for 
the next time. 

When ready for the next batch, add

BRIDE'S COOK BOOK 



the necessary quantity of salted warm 
water and the honey; stir thoroughly, 
and then add the buckwheat as^ before. 
It is better to mix the dough a little too 
thick than too thin. Water can be safely 
added before baking, if necessary. If 
the batter is sour in the morning from 
being kept too warm, use a little baking 
soda dissolved in warm water. The old 
batter is useless for yeast after the soda 
treatment. 

Serve with honey.

Visit 3 stores when buying Furniture 



Always visit 3 stores — study, in as critical a manner as possible, each 
store's policy, each store's values, each store's prices. Tf Have each sales- 
man explain materials used; learn the difference between the real and 
the "just as good"; ask what each store does if you are dissatisfied 
at any time; realize the difference between "painted pine" at $25, and 
"6-coat enamel over maple" at $80 — the both may be called "decorated 
ivory." 1| Then place your order with the store which gives you the 
best value, service and satisfaction for the money you invest. 



From the department of Interior 
Decoration right through the depart- 
ments of service we are all here to help 
you. Give us a floor, four walls and a 
ceiling — and we can transform it into 
an artistic creation: a Home. 



The Furniture and Furnishings dis- 
played in this fine store-building are 
dependable things. They are of the 
best class and grade obtainable in their 
Tarious price-categories, and mast give 
"PLEASURE, in Comfort and Beauty; 
SERVICE, in Economy and Utility." 



Our salesmen are more than "order- 
takers" — they like Furniture ; they are 
friendly experts ; they know the merch- 
andise they sell ; they know what you 
want that merchandise to be and do; 
and they courteously and helpfully put 
your interests and your satisfaction 
'way ahead of the mere figures involved 
in the sale. 

Seventy per cent of our customers pay 
cash ; thirty per cent use our Monthly 
Payment Plan. (From the customer's

means much. We are always glad to 
open desirable new accounts on this

TO FRY FISH 

After the fish is well cleansed, lay it 
on a folded towel and dry out all the 
water; when well wiped and dry, roll it 
in Indian meal. Have a thick-bottomed 
frying pan with plenty of fat salted (a 
tablespoonful of salt to each pound of 
lard) for fresh fish which have not been 
previously salted; let it become boiling 
hot, then lay the fish in and let it fry 
gently until one side is a fine, delicate 
brown, then turn the other; when both 
are done take it up carefully and serve 
quickly, or keep it covered with a tin 
cover, and set the dish where it will keep 
hot. 

TO BROIL FISH 

Rub the bars of your gridiron with 
dripping or a piece of beef suet, to pre- 
vent the fish from sticking. Put a good 
piece of butter substitute into a dish, 
enough salt and pepper to season the 
fish. Lay the fish on it when it is 
broiled, and with a knife put the butter 
over every part. Serve very hot. 

TO BAKE FISH WHOLE 

No. I 

Cut off the head and split the fish 
down nearly to the tail; prepare a dress- 
ing of bread, butter substitute, pepper 
and salt, moisten with a little water. 
Fill the dish with this dressing, and bind 
it together with a piece of string; lay the 
fish on a bake-pan and pour round it a 
little water and melted butter substitute. 
Baste frequently. A good-sized fish will 
bake in an hour. Serve with the gravy of 
the fish. 

BAKED FISH No. II 

Take whatever fish may be desired and 
place in baking pan. Chop up a little 
onion, garlic, parsley and tomatoes and 
spread over fish; then moisten with a 
little olive oil and bake in moderate oven 
for about 20 minutes. (This recipe will 
be found very good for small sole. Rex 
sole, or sandabs.) Add salt and pepper 
to taste. 

BROILED SALT MACKEREL 

Freshen by soaking it over night in 
water, being careful that the skin lies 



uppermost. In the morning dry it with- 
out breaking, cut off the head and tip of 
the tail, place it between the bars of a 
greased fish-gridiron, and broil to a light 
brown; lay it on a hot dish, and dress 
with a little butter, pepper, and lemon 
juice, vinegar. 

BROILED SALMON 

Cut six slices of salmon, sprinkle with 
salt and pepper, dip in beaten eggs and 
roll in corn meal. Place in a spider, 
cook both sides quickly. Drain and lay 
them in a dish. Garnish them with a few 
pieces of lemon dipped in parsley 
chopped fine and some eggs fried in oil. 

BOILED SALMON 

Sew as many pounds as desired up in a 
cheese-cloth bag, and boil for a quarter 
of an hour to the pound, in slightly 
salted water. When done, take out and 
lay upon a dish, being careful not to 
break the fish. 

CREAM SAUCE 

Prepare a small cupful of cream sauce, 
in which had been stirred a teaspoonful 
of minced parsley and the juice of one- 
fourth of a lemon. Pour over the salmon 
and serve. Garnish with parsley. The 
choicest portion of the salmon is that at 
the center and toward the tail. 

BOILED HALIBUT 

Purchase a thick slice cut through the 
body, or the tail piece, which is consid- 
ered the richest. Wrap it in a floured 
cloth and lay it in warm water with salt 
in it. A piece weighing six pounds should 
be cooked in half an hour after the water 
begins to boil. Melted butter or butter 
substitute and parsley are eaten with it. 
If any is left, lay it in a deep dish and 
sprinkle on it a little salt, throw over it 
twelve cloves in some vinegar, and it 
will, when cold, have much the flavor of 
lobster. 

BAKED BASS 

Make filling of cracker or bread 
crumbs, an egg, pepper, cloves, salt and 
butter substitute. Fill very full, when 
sewed up, grate over it a small nutmeg,

HOW TO SELECT POULTRY 

In selecting poultry full-grown fowls 
have the best flavor, provided they are 
young. The age may be determined by 
turning the wing backward — if it yields, 
it is tender. The same is true if the skin 
on the leg is readily broken. Older 
poultry makes the best soup. The in- 
testines should be removed at once, but 
frequently in shipping they are left in 
and, hence, when removed, the fowl 
needs washing in several waters. The 
next to the last water should contain a 
half teaspoon of baking soda, which 
sweetens and renders all more whole- 
some. The giblets are the gizzard, 
heart, liver and neck. 



ROAST TURKEY 

Carefully pluck the bird and singe off 
the down with lighted paper; break the 
leg bone close to the foot, hang up the 
bird and draw out the strings of the 
thigh. Never cut the breast; make a 
small slit down the back of the neck 
and take out the crop that way, then cut 
the neck bone close, and after the bird 
is stuffed the skin can be turned over 
the back and the crop will look full and 
round. Cut around the vent, making the 
hole as small as possible, and draw 
carefully, taking care that the gall bag 
and the intestines joining the gizzard are 
not broken. Open the gizzard, take out 
the contents and detach the liver from 
the gall bladder. The liver, gizzard and 
heart, if used in the gravy, will need to 
be boiled an hour and a half and chopped 
as fine as possible. Wash the turkey 
and wipe thoroughly dry, inside and oiit; 
then fill the inside with stuffing, and sew 
the skin of the neck over the back. Sew 
up the opening at the vent, then run a 
long skewer into the pinion and thigh 
through the body, passing it through the 
opposite pinion and thigh. Put a skewer 
in the small part of the leg, close on the 
outside and push it through. Pass a 
string over the points of the skewers 
and tie it securely at the back. 



Sprinkle well with barley flour, coyer 
the breast with nicely-buttered^ white 
paper, place on a grating in the dripping- 
pan and put in the oven to roast. Baste 
every fifteen minutes — a few times with 
butter and water, and then with the 
gravy in the dripping-pan. Do not have 
too hot an oven. A turkey weighing ten 
pounds will require three hours to bake. 

ROAST GOOSE 

Get a goose that is not more than eight 
months old, and the fatter it is the more 
juicy the meat. The dressing should be 
made of three pints of bread crumbs, six 
ounces of butter substitute, a teaspoonful 
each of sage, black pepper and salt and 
chopped onions. Don't stuff very full, but 
sew very closely so that the fat will not 
get in. Place in a baking pan with a little 
water and baste often with a little salt, 
water and vinegar. Turn the goose fre- 
quently so that it may be evenly 
browned. Bake about two and one-half 
hours. When done, take it from the 
pan, drain off the fat and add the 
chopped giblets, which have previously 
been boiled tender, together with the 
water in which they were done. Thicken 
with barley flour and drippings rubbed 
together; let boil, and serve. 

BAKED CHICKEN 

Take a plump chicken, dress and lay in 
cold salt water for half hour, put in pan, 
stuff and sprinkle with salt and pepper; 
lay a few slices of fat pork. Cover and 
bake until tender, with a steady fire. 
Baste often. Turn so as to have uni- 
form heat. 

BOILED CHICKEN 

Clean, wash and stuff as for roasting. 
Baste a floured cloth around each, and 
put into a pot with enough boiling water 
to cover them well. The hot water 
cooks the skin at once, and prevents the 
escape of the juices. The broth will not 
be so rich as if the fowls are put on in 
cold water, but this is proof that the 
meat will be more nutritious and better 
flavored. Stew very slowly, for the first 
half hour especially. Boil an hour or 
more, guiding yourself by size and tough- 
ness. Serve with egg.

BRIDE'S COOK BOOK 



CHICKEN FRICASSEE 

Clean and disjoint chicken. Wipe each 
piece. Put in pot, cover with boiling 
water and simmer till tender. To the 
liquor add one cup or more hot milk, 
thicken with barley flour dissolved in 
cold water. Season well, boil for a few 
minutes. Serve with dumplings or bis- 
cuit. 

TO BROIL A CHICKEN 

Singe, wipe and with a sharp-pointed 
knife, beginning at back of neck, make 
a cut through backbone the entire length 
of bird. Lay open the bird and remove 
contents from inside. Cut out rib bones 
on either side of backbone, remove from 
breastbone and cut through tendons at 
joints. 

Sprinkle with salt and pepper, and 
place in a well-greased broiler. Broil 
twenty minutes over a clear fire, watch- 
ing carefully and turning broiler so that 
all parts may be equally browned. The 
flesh side must be exposed to the fire 
the greater part of the time as the skin 
side will brown quickly. Remove to a 
hot platter, spread with soft butter, and 
sprinkle with salt and pepper. Chickens 
are so apt to burn while broiling that 
many prefer to partially cook them in 
the oven. Place chicken in dripping-pan, 
skin side down, sprinkle with salt and 
pepper, dot over with butter or butter 
substitute, and bake IS minutes in hot 
oven. Then broil to finish cooking. 

CHICKEN CROQUETTES 

Cut up fine any kind of cold fowl, 
season with salt, pepper and butter, a 
little onion, stir in two fresh eggs. Make 
in cakes, dip in beaten egg, then in oat- 
meal and fry in boiling lard or lard and 
butter mixed. 

FRIED SPRING CHICKEN 

Clean and disjoint, then soak in salt 
water for about two hours. Put in fry- 
ing pan equal parts of lard and butter, 
enough to cover chicken. Roll each piece 
in barley flour, dip in beaten egg, 
then roll in crumbs, and drop into 
boiling fat. Fry until browned on both 
sides. Serve on flat platter garnished 
with sprigs of parsley. Pour most of the 
fat from frying pan, thicken remainder 
with browned flour, add to it a cup of 
boiling water or milk. Serve in gravy 
bowl. 



CHICKEN PIE 

Disjoint fowl and simmer in boiling 
water until tender. Season to taste, and 
lay in deep baking dish. Mix two level 
tablespoons cornstarch with two level 
tablespoons of barley flour, add four 
tablespoons cream and three cups hot 
chicken stock, stir till it thickens. Pour 
over chicken and cover with crust. Sift 
into mixing bowl one-half cup of barley 
flour, one-quarter cup cornstarch, two 
and one-half teaspoons baking powder, 
one-quarter teaspoon salt; rub in finely 
one tablespoon each of lard and butter. 
Add milk to make dough enough as soft 
as may be handled. Roll out little 
larger than top of dish, so that crust 
may be placed on loosely. Pierce small 
openings in crust, and bake until crust 
is well done. Send to table in baking 
dish. 

BOILED CHICKEN— ROYAL STYLE 

Truss chicken and tie strips of bacon 
oyer the breast. Put into a kettle, cover 
with boiling water, season with salt and 
pepper, cover close and cook slowly 
until tender. Remove from water, drain, 
rub with mixture of creamed butter and 
barley flour and brown in the oven. Cool 
the liquor quickly and remove the fat, 
then reheat. To each pint of liquor allow 
one and one-half tablespoons corn starch. 
Blend the corn starch in a little cold 
water, pour into the hot liquor and boil 
ten minutes. Then add one-half cup 
chopped mushrooms. When gravy is 
perfectly done, remove from fire, and to 
one pint of gravy add yolk of one tgg, 
slightly beaten. Do not cook again after 
the yolk has been added, or it may curdle. 
Serve gravy in boat. 

BAKED CHICKEN 

Dress, clean, and cut up two chickens. 
Place in a dripping-pan, sprinkle with 
salt and pepper, dredge with flour (bar- 
ley flour) and dot over with butter sub- 
stitute. Bake thirty minutes in a hot 
oven, basting every five minutes with 
butter substitute or drippings melted in 
one-quarter cup boiling water. Serve 
with gravy made by using fat in pan, one- 
quarter cup substitute flour, one cup each 
of chicken stock and cream, and salt and 
pepper to taste. 

CHICKEN A LA CREOLE 

Cut a boiled chicken into cubes of an 
inch. Put a tablespoonful of butter sub- 
stitute and one of grated onion in a fry- 
ing pan, add half a cupful of tomato and

Red Pepper, Green Pepper, Parsley, 

■A Tablespoon each. Finely Chopped 
Duchess Potatoes 
8 Mushroom Caps 
1 Teaspoon Finely Chopped Onion 
Vz Ciove Garlic, Finely Chopped 
1 Teaspoon Lemon Juice

per, parsley, onion, garlic, and lemon 
juice. Split a young chicken as for broil- 
ing, place in dripping-pan, sprinkle with 
salt and pepper, dot over with butter 
substitute, and bake in a hot oven until 
nearly cooked. Grease plank, arrange a 
border of Duchess Potatoes close to 
edge of plank, and remove chicken to 
plank. Clean, peel, and saute mushroom 
caps, place on chicken, spread over pre- 
pared butter substitute, and put in a very 
hot oven to brown potatoes and finish 
cooking chicken. Serve on the plank. 

CHICKEN CURRY 



3 Pounds Chicken 
1-3 Cup Butter Substitute 
2 Onions 

1 Tablespoon Curry Powder 

2 Teaspoons Salt 

1 Teaspoon Vinegar 

Clean, dress, and cut chicken in pieces 
for serving. Put grease in a hot frying- 
pan, add chicken, and cook ten minutes; 
then add liver and gizzard and cook ten 
minutes longer. Cut onions in thin slices, 
and add to chicken with curry powder 
and salt. Add enough boiling water to 
cover, and simmer until chicken is ten- 
der. Remove chicken, strain and thicken 
liquor with flour diluted with enough 
cold water to pour easily. Pour gravy 
over chicken, and serve with a border of 
rice or Turkish pilaf. 

CHICKEN EN CASSEROLE 

Cut two small, young chickens in 



pieces for serving. Season with salt and 
pepper, brush over with melted butter 
substitute and bake in a casserole dish 
twelve minutes. Parboil one-third cup 
carrots cut in strips five minutes, drain, 
and fry with one tablespoon finely 
chopped onion and four thin slices 
bacon cut in narrow strips. Add one 
and one-third cups brown sauce and two- 
thirds cup potato balls. Add to chicken, 
with three tablespoons Sherry wine, salt 
and pepper to taste. Cook in a moderate 
oven twenty minutes, or until chicken is 
tender. If small casserole dishes are 
used allow but one chicken to each dish. 



JELLIED CHICKEN 

Dress, clean, and cut up a four-pound 
fowl. Put in a stewpan with two slices 
onion, cover with boiling water, and 
cook slowly until meat falls from bones. 
When half cooked, add one-half table- 
spoon salt. Remove chicken; reduce 
stock to three-quarters cup, strain, and 
skim off fat. Decorate bottom of a 
mold with parsley, and slices of hard- 
boiled eggs. Pack in meat freed from 
skin and bone and sprinkled with salt 
and pepper. Pour on stock and place 
mold under heavy weight. Keep in a 
cold place until firm. In summer it is 
necessary to add one teaspoon dis- 
solved granulated gelatine to stock. 

ROAST TAME DUCK 

Take a young farmyard duck fattened 
at liberty, but cleansed by being shut 
up two or three days and fed on barley 
meal and water. Pluck, singe and 
empty; scald the feet, skin and twist 
round on the back of the bird; head, 
neck and pinions must be cut off, the 
latter at the first joint, and all skewered 
firmly to give the breast a nice plump 
appearance. For stuffing, one-half 
pound of onions, one teaspoon of pow- 
dered sage, three tablespoons of bread 
crumbs, the liver of a duck parboiled 
and minced with cayenne pepper and 
salt. Cut fine onions, throwing boiling 
water over them for ten minutes; drain 
through a gravy strainer, and add the 
bread crumbs, minced liver, sage, pep- 
per and salt to taste; mix, and put inside 
the duck. This amount is for one duck; 
more onion and more sage may be 
added, but the above is a delicate com- 
pound not likely to disagree with the 
stomach. Let the duck be hung a day 
or two, according to the weather, to

To Make Coffee ''Good'' — Use Good Coffee 

HAVE COFFEE POT THOROUGHLY CLEANED DAILY. 
USE A TABLESPOONFUL COFFEE FOR EACH CUP AND ONE FOR THE POT. 

Follow any one of these 

THREE METHODS 

Boiling or Brewing Method — A 

Use coffee ground medium. Pour boiling water on required 
amount of coffee in order to bring out the richness and 
strength. Let simmer slowly for fifteen minutes. 

Percolating Method — B 

Use finely ground coffee. After the water begins bubbling 
over the coffee let continue so, percolating slowly from 
fifteen to twenty minutes until the rich, brown color and 
strength of the coffee are finally brought out. 

^ Filtration Method — C 

Place coffee, ground very finely or pulverized, in bag sus- 
pended in coee pot and pass the required amount of boil- 
ing water. 

The filtration method is the quickest way to make coffee 
but a great deal of care must be given to the bag. It 
should at all times be kept absolutely clean and sweet. A 
good method to adopt is to start with a new bag every 

Sunday morning and immediately after using the bag should be thoroughly 

cleaned in hot water and kept in a jar of fresh, cold water. 

Do not use soap in cleaning the bag. 

N. B. — Boiling water must be 212 o. 

Keep the brew hot. Chilling the brew destroys the affiliation of oils and 

water and therefore the flavor. 

Our steel cut process used in grinding coffee eliminates the hitter chaff, 

and the result is

make the flesh tender. Roast before a 
brisk, clear fire, baste often, and dredge 
with flour to make the bird look frothy. 
Serve with a good brown gravy in the 
dish, and apple sauce in a tureen. It 
takes about an hour. 

BRAISED WILD DUCK 

Chop fine one head of celery, a bunch 
of parsley, one small onion, a piece of 
garlic, one cup of sage, a pinch of mace 
and red pepper, salt to suit. Beat yolk 
of one egg and bind stuffing, adding also 
a heaping teaspoon of soft butter. Fill 
ducks, sew up opening, put in braising 
'pan with cover, adding a little onion, 
garlic, parsley and celery cut fine, a bay 
leaf, two tablespoons of cider vinegar, 
a small glass of white wine, pinch of 
sage, red pepper and salt, five table- 
spoons of butter and a pint of good 
Istock. Cover tightly and put in me- 
Idium oven, cooking one hour. Mix with 
icold water two tablespoons of browned 
iflour and stir in one-quarter cup of 
capers. Cover and cook slowly for half 
an hour or more; beat to a paste with a 
teaspoon of butter the yolks of three 
hardboiled eggs, a pinch of salt and red 
pepper. Form into small balls. Put 
the ducks on large squares of toast. Put 
egg balls around and pour sauce over 
all. 

ROAST WILD DUCK 

Dress and clean a wild duck and truss. 
Place on rack in dripping-pan, sprinkle 
with salt and pepper, and cover breast 
with two very thin slices fat salt pork. 
Bake twenty to thirty minutes in a very 
hot oven, basting every five minutes 
with fat in pan; cut string and remove 
string and skewers. Serve with orange 
or olive sauce. Currant jelly should ac- 
company a duck course. Domestic 
ducks should always be well cooked, 
requiring little more than twice the 
time allowed for wild ducks. 

Ducks are sometimes stuffed with 
apples, pared, cored, and cut in quar- 
ters, or three small onions may be put 
in ^ body of duck to improve flavor. 
Neither apples nor onions are to be 
served. If a stuffing to be eaten is de- 
sired, cover pieces of dry bread with 
boiling water; as soon as bread has ab- 
sorbed water, press out the water; sea- 
son bread with salt, pepper, melted but- 
ter, finely chopped onion, or use

BROILED QUAIL 

Follow recipe for broiling chicken, al- 
lowing eight minutes for cooking. Serve 
on pieces of toast, and garnish with 
parsley and thin slices of lemon. Cur- 
rant jelly or rice croquettes with jelly 
should accompany this course. 

QUAIL ON TOAST 

Take five quail, but don't remove the 
skins, for you would lose all the taste of 
the game. Wipe them well; string them 
tight, so as to raise the breasts. Put a 
little butter substitute on each, a little 
lemon juice, and inside each the quarter 
of a lemon without the peel. Then put 
a very thin slice of pork, about two 
inches square, around each quail, with 
two or three cuts in each side, and string 
it tight. Let cook on a good fire, and 
when they are nearly well done (for 
white meat game must be well done) cut 
the strings; dress nicely on toast and 
serve hot. Pour the juice on the quail 
after having taken the fat off, and put 
some slices of lemon* around the dish, 
one for each quail.

CONSOMME OR PLAIN MEAT . 
STOCK FOR SOUP 

Consomme or stock forms the basis 
of all meat soups, gravies and purees. 
The simpler it is made, the longer it 
keeps. It is best made of fresh un- 
cooked beef and some broken bones, to 
which may be added the remnants of 
broken meats. In a home where meat 
forms part of the every-day diet, a good 
cook will seldom be without a stock-pot. 

Four pounds of beef and broken 
bones, one gallon of cold water and two 
teaspoons of salt. Put the meat and 
water on the back of the stove and let 
it slowly come to a boil, then simmer 
three or four hours, until the water is 
boiled away one-half; add the salt, 
strain and set to cool, in an earthenware 
dish well covered. When cold, take off 
the fat from the top and it is ready for 
use. To make soup for a family of six, 
take one-quarter of the stock, to which 
add one-quarter of boiling water, and 
any vegetables desired — boil three hours. 
Season with salt and pepper. 

MIXED STOCK FOR SOUPS 

To six pounds of lean beef, with the 
bones well cracked, add six quarts of 
water. Put the beef, bones and water in 
a covered kettle on the stove to heat 
slowly. Let it boil gently for six hours. 
After it ha$ boiled for six hours, strain 
and set aside well covered until the next 
day. Before needed, remove the fat, set 
the soup over the fire and put in a little 
salt, two carrots, two onions, one tur- 
nip, one head of celery. Stew in suffi- 
cient water to cover them. When ten- 
der, add the vegetables and the water 
in which they were cooked, to the soup. 
Boil slowly for one-half hour. Strain 
when done. A bay leaf added to the 
stock before cooking the second day, 
adds greatly to the flavor. 

MUTTON BROTH 

Place in a kettle three pounds of a 
neck of mutton from which the fat has 
been cut, and chopped into small pieces, 
with six pints of water. Boil, skim, set 



the pan to the rear of the stove, where 
it can simmer for an hour. Add three 
ounces of washed rice, with a turnip and 
some celery. Simmer for two hours. 
Strain, free from fat and salt. 

BEEF TEA 

Take two pounds of lean rump beef, 
remove all fat, cut into small pieces and 
place in a tightly corked bottle. Place 
the bottle in a deep saucepan of cold 
water, reaching two-thirds of the way to 
the top of the bottle, place over a slow 
fire, and keep it boiling slowly for fifteen 
minutes, take out the bottle, pour out 
the liquor, and use as required. 

BOUILLON 

Four pounds of beef, one knuckle of 
veal, one carrot, two small turnips, a 
sprig of celery, one very small red pep- 
per pod, two small onions, salt and six 
quarts of water; boil six hours, and 
strain through a sieve. Let stand over 
night. Serve hot. 

BARLEY BROTH 

Put two pounds of shin beef in one 
gallon of water. Add a teacup of pearl 
barley, three large onions and a small 
bunch of parsley minced, three potatoes 
sliced, a little thyme and pepper, salt to 
taste. Simmer steadily three hours, and 
stir often, so that the meat will not bum. 
Do not let it boil. Always stir soup or 
broth with a wooden spoon. 

TURKEY SOUP 

Place the remains of a cold turkey 
and what is left of the dressing and 
gravy in pot, and cover it with cold 
water. Simmer slowly four hours, and 
let stand until the next day. Take ofl 
what fat may have arisen, and take out 
with a skimmer all the bits of bones. 
Put the soup on to heat until at boiling 
point, then thicken slightly with flour 
stirred into a cup of cream, and season 
to taste. Pick off all the meat from 
bones, put it back in the soup, boil up 
and serve.

broiling except that instead of cooking it 
in the oven it is to be quickly browned, 
first on one side and then on the other, 
over a hot fire, and removed a little from 
the fire to finish cooking. Meat an 
inch thick will broil in about four min- 
utes. Season after it is cooked. 

FRYING 

There are two methods of frying: One 
with very little fat in the pan, to prac- 
tice which successfully the pan and the 
fat must be hot before the article to be 
fried is put into it. For instance, in 
frying chops, if the pan is hot, and only 
fat enough is used to keep the chops 
from sticking to it, the heat being main- 
tained so that the chops cook quickly, 
they will be nearly as nice as if they 
were broiled. Frying by the other 
method consists in entirely covering the 
article to be cooked in smoking-hot fat 
and keeping the fat at that degree of 
heat until the food is brown. It should 
then be taken up with a skimmer and 
laid upon brown paper for a moment to 
free it from grease. 

BOILING AND STEWING 

Fresh meat for boiling should be put 
into boiling water and boiled very 
gently about twenty minutes for each 
pound. A little salt, spice or vegetables 
ynay be boiled in the water with the 
meat for seasoning. A little vinegar put 
in the water with tough meat makes it 
tender. The broth of boiled meat should 
always be saved to use in soups, stews 
and gravies. Stewing and simmering 
meats means to place them near enough

to the fire to keep the water on them 
bubbling moderately, constantly and 
slowly. Salt meats should be put over 
the fire in cold water, which, as soon as 
it boils, should be replaced by fresh 
cold water, the water to be changed un- 
til it remains fresh enough to give the 
meat a palatable flavor when done. 
Salted and smoked meats require about 
30 minutes very slowly boiling, from the 
time the water boils, to each pound. 
Vegetables and herb? may be boiled 
with them to flavor them. When they 
are cooked the vessel containing them 
should be set where they will keep hot 
without boiling until wanted, if they 
are to be served hot; if they are to be 
served cold, they should be allowed to 
cool in the pot liquor in which they 
were boiled. Very salt meats, or those 
much dried in smoking, should be 
soaked over night in cold water before 
boiling. 

ROASTING 

Wipe the meat with damp cloth. Trim 
and tie into shape, if necessary. In the 
bottom of pan put some pieces of fat 
from meat. Arrange meat on rack in 
pan. Sprinkle with salt, pepper and 
flour. Have oven very hot at first; when 
meat is half done reduce heat. Baste 
every ten or fifteen minutes. If there 
is danger of fat in pan being scorched, 
add a few spoons of boiling water. Al- 
low from ten to twenty minutes per 
pound of meat, according as it is desired, 
rare or well done. When done remove 
to hot plate. Thicken gravy in pan with 
barley flour, adding more water as neces- 
sary and add seasoning. An onion may 
be laid on top of the roast to give it 
flavor, but should be removed before 
serving. 

In purchasing meat one should know 
how to select the best quality, and the 
most useful pieces. 

Beef, which stands at the head of the 
list, as being most generally used and 
liked, should be of a bright, clear red, 
and fat white. It should be well clothed 
in fat, to insure it being tender and 
juicy. The finest pieces are the sirloin 
and the ribs— the latter making the best 
roasting piece in the animal. 

In cooking steaks remember it is far 
better to turn over three or four times 
on a platter containing a little olive oil 
than it is to hammer them, to make 
them tender. The object is not to force 
the juice, but to soften the fibre. 

In selecting pork, one cannot exercise 
too great care in examining it. Do not 
buy any that is clammy or has kernels in 



the fat. Remember, too, when the rind 
is hard it is old. 

Veal should be fine in grain, of a 
delicate pink, with plenty of kidney fat. 
It should never be eaten under two 
months old. 

Mutton should be firm and juicy, the 
flesh close-grained, the fat hard and 
white. 

TO CLARIFY DRIPPINGS 

Drippings accumulated from different 
cooked meats (except mutton, which has 
a strong flavor), can be clarified by put- 
ting all into a basin and slicing into it 
raw potato, allowing it to boil long 
enough for the potato to brown, which 
causes all impurities to disappear. Re- 
move from the fire, and when cool drain 
into basin and set in a cool place. 

BEEF 
HINT ON COOKING ROAST BEEF 

For roast beef to be juicy and tender 
when done, it should be basted every 
few minutes so in order to save your- 
self this trouble, place a large piece of 
beef suet on top of the roast; have bak- 
ing pan perfectly dry and oven very hot; 
place in the oven and let cook the al- 
lotted time — say half an hour, according 
to the size. You can be about your in- 
side work and in the allotted time your 
roast is done to a beautiful brown and 
is very juicy, as it has been constantly 
basting itself all the while with the suet. 
Take roast out of pan, pour off drip- 
pings in a bowl and make a gravy on 
top of stove. A nice addition to this is • 
to put half dozen or so peeled potatoes 
in the pan with roast when placing it in 
to cook, and they will be done to a 
nicety when the roast is. On taking up 
roast lay baked potatoes around same. 
This was an experiment and proved 
very successful, and saves a great deal 
of work and worry. 

BOILED BEEF WITH CABBAGE 

1 Head Cabbage 
5 Pounds Beef 
Salt, Pepper 

Remove all bruised or soiled leaves 
from cabbage, and cut in sections length- 
wise, leaving a piece of the heart on each 
section to hold it together. Boil beef » 
for an hour, or more, according to size 
of piece. Place cabbage on top of meat 
and cook together one hour, seasoning 
to taste. Lift out the beef, allow the 
cabbage to boil a few minutes in the 
broth and serve.

considerable salt. Make a dressing the 
same as for fowls; unroll the loin, put 
the stuffing well around the kidney, fold 
and secure with several coils of white 
cotton twine wound around in all direc- 
tions; place in a dripping pan, with the 
thick side down, and put in a rather hot 
oven, letting it cool down to moderate; 
in one-half hour add a little hot water 
to the pan, and baste often; after half 
an hour turn over the roast and when 
done sprinkle lightly with barley flour 
and baste with melted butter. Before 
serving carefully remove the twine. A 
roast of four or five pounds will bake in 
about two hours. For a gravy, skim off 
some of the fat if there is too much in 
the drippings; dredge in barley flour; 
stir until brown, add hot water if neces- 
sary; boil a few minutes, stir in sweet 
herbs as fancied and put in a gravy boat. 
Serve with green peas and lemon jelly. 



FRIED SWEETBREADS

done, let it become cold in the lilquor iif 
which it was boiled. Then remove the 
rind carefully, without injuring the fat, 
press a cloth over it to absorb as much 
of the -grease as possible, and shake 
some bread raspings over the fat. Brown 
quickly in hot oven. Serve cold, gar-

Visit 3 stores when buying Furniture 



Always visit 3 stores — study, in as critical a manner as possible, each 
store's policy, each store's values, each store's prices. ^ Have each sales- 
man explain materials used; learn the difference between the real and 
the "just as good"; ask what each store does if you are dissatisfied 
at any time; realize the difference between "painted pine" at $25, and 
"6-coat enamel over maple" at $80 — the both may be called "decorated 
ivory." H Then place your order with the store which gives you the 
best value, service and satisfaction for the money you invest. 



From the department of Interior 
Decoration right through the depart- 
ments of service we are all here to help 
you. Give us a floor, four walls and a 
ceiling — ^and we can transform it into 
an artistic creation : a Home. 



The Furniture and Furnishings dis- 
played in this fine store-building are 
dependable things. They are of the 
best class and grade obtainable in their 
various price-categories, and must give 
"PLEASURE, in Comfort and Beauty; 
SERVICE, in Economy and Utility." 



Our salesmen are more than "ordep- 
takers"— they like Furniture ; they are 
friendly experts ; they know the merch- 
andise they sell ; they know what you 
want that merchandise to be and do; 
and they courteously and helpfully put 
your interests and your satisfaction 
'way ahead of the mere figures involved 
in the sale. 

Seventy per cent of our customers pay 
cash ; thirty per cent use our Monthly 
Payment Plan. (From the customer's 
standpoint this plan is very beneficial. 
Having credit with The John Breuner

other stores, as our recommendation 
means much. We are always glad to 
open desirable new accounts on this 
plan.)

6 or 8 minutes if liked "soft boiled," or 
from 40 to 45 minutes if liked "hard 
boiled." 

After rfemoyiiig "hard boiled" eggs 
from pan, they should be immediately 
plunged into cold water to prevent dis- 
coloration of yolks. 

POACHED EGGS

GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR PRE- 
PARING 

Scrub root vegetables thoroughly with 
a stiff brush. 

Thin skins may be scraped off, thick 
skins must be pared off. Most thick 
skins are more easily removed after 
cooking. 

Any kind of greens should be rinsed 
in several waters to remove all grit. 
If the vegetables are wilted they may be 
freshened by soaking in cold water for 
a few hours before using. 

Head vegetables should be placed head 
down, in a pan of cold water containing 
a little salt or vinegar. This will remove 
any small insects that may be lodged 
in them. 

The strings from string beans should 
be pulled or cut off with great care. 

Remove and throw away the inner 
pulp and seeds of old squashes and 
pumpkins. 

The whole of summer squash is edible. 

Scald tomatoes, pour cold water over 
them. This makes them easier to peel. 

The outer covering must be removed 
from sweet corn, green peas, or shell 
beans. 

ECONOMICAL POINTS IN PRE- 
PARING 

1. Peel thinly or not at all until after 
they are cooked. You will save from 15 
to 20% of the nutritive value of the 
whole vegetable. 

2. Do not discard leaves of lettuce, 
celery, beets or roots, dandelion nub- 
bins and roots — they contain much min- 
eral matter. 

Cook them until tender, rub through 
a sieve and use in stock for vegetable 
soup. 

3. Do not throw away water in which 
vegetables have been cooked — it con- 
tains nourishing starch and mineral mat- 
ter. Use it in the soup pot or as a basis 
for cream soups or sauces. 

4. Do not remove the pink skins from 
rhubarb. It takes away from the flavor. 
Cut through it with a sharp knife. 

5. Do not discard the cores and skins 



of apples when making apple sauce. 
Save and make into jelly. 

GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR 
COOKING VEGETABLES 
V EG E T A B L E S may be baked, 
steamed, stewed or boiled. 

In BAKING, no nutritive material is 
lost. You may bake potatoes, sweet 
potatoes, squash, pumpkins, beets, young 
onions, peas, dried beans and lentils. 

In STEAMING there is no loss of 
nutritive material, but there is more loss 
in the flavor of the vegetable than in 
baking. All fresh young vegetables may 
be cooked in this way. 

In STEWING, if properly done there 
is but little loss of nutritive substances. 
The vegetables should be placed in just 
enough boiling water to prevent them 
from burning while cooking, so that the 
liquid left at the end of the cooking 
process can be served with the vege- 
table. 

In BOILING, there is a great waste 
of nutritive matter. This method should 
only be used in the cooking of very old 
beets, turnips or potatoes, or potatoes 
with their skins on. It may also be 
used for strong onions or cabbage, as it 
insures a mild flavor. 

IN STEWING OR BOILING, AL- 
WAYS ADD VEGETABLES TO 
BOILING WATER. 

SALT (1 teaspoon to each quart of 
water) may be added to the water in 
which all green vegetables, potatoes or 
onions, are cooked. Do not add salt to 
parsnips, salsify, carrots or turnips, or 
other underground vegetables until after 
cooking. Do not allow vegetables to 
boil too rapidly — it dissipates the flavor 
and spoils the color. Cook in a vessel 
without a cover. 

FRESH VEGETABLES 

CREAMED VEGETABLES 

Prepare and cook vegetables by either 
stewing or boiling them. When ready 
to serve, pour over white sauce.

each slice; then pour in enough hot 
water to cover the bottom of the pan; 
After cooking on the top of the range 
for 10 or 15 minutes, turn each slice with 
a knife and boil until tender. More hot 
water may have to be added. Place the 
pan in the oven and let the squash take 
on a delicate brown. Serve at once after 
removing from the pan.

Few Grains Cayenne 

Yolk 1 Hard Boiled Egg 

1 Egg 

2 Tablespoons Vinegar 

Wipe, peel, and cut tomatoes in slices.

lengthwise in 2 or 3 slices. Pour about 
l4 cup honey into a pan until the bottom 
is covered about % inch deep. Let this 
become very hot, put in the sweet 
potatoes, and cook about 10 minutes. 
The grape sugar in the honey combined 
with the dextrin in the sweet potato 
gives a delicious nutlikc flavor to pota- 
toes cooked in this manner. The honey 
must be hot when the sweet potatoes 
are put in, as too long cooking destroys 
the flavor. Serve with butter and salt.

been removed and which have been par- 
boiled five minutes. Cover the top with 
fine crumbs and bits of butter substitute; 
bake in a moderate oven fifteen minutes. 



POTATOES 

Always serve potatoes with meat. 
Never serve bread and potatoes. 

POTATOES AS A VEGETABLE 
ECONOMICAL POINTS IN PRE- 
PARING 

1. Steam potatoes in their skins. In 
this way you will save one pound of 
potatoes in every seven pounds you pre- 
pare. It improves their flavor. 

2. Much nutriment is lost when pota- 
toes are boiled. Steam or bake them. 

3. Choose potatoes of equal size. 
Otherwise some will be over-cooked and 
others under-cooked. 



POTATOES STEAMED IN THEIR 
SKINS 

Prepare a saucepan of boiling water 
with steamer attached. Scrub the pota- 
toes well. Put them into the steamer and 
cook them about one-half hour or until 
potatoes are soft when pierced with a 
fork. Remove steamer from the pan. 
Shake it until the potatoes are dry, and 
serve in their skins, or peel, if desired. 

If you have no steamer, use a basin, 
placed in a saucepan containing boiling 
water. In this case, cook five or six 
minutes longer. 

BAKED POTATOES— No. 1 

Scrub potatoes well, dry and place in a. 
baking tin. Bake in a moderate oven 
from one to two hours, according to size. 
Too great heat will cause the potatoes 
to shrivel. 

Potatoes are improved by being 
steamed for about twenty minutes before 
baking. Large potatoes are best for 
baking. 

BAKED POTATOES— No. 2 

Steam potatoes until the skins peel off 
easily. Roughen the surface with a fork 
and sprinkle with a little flour and salt. 
Place potatoes in a pan with two or 
three tablespoon of dripping. Baste 
often and cook until potatoes are brown 
and tender. 

STUFFED POTATOES 

Use large potatoes of uniform size 
and wash and scrub them well. When 
baked, cut off a piece lengthwise and 
scoop out the inside of the potato. 
Mash this with margarine and milk. 
Add any minced cooked meat or cooked 
flaked fish, anchovy or the remains of 
any sauce, such as egg sauce, shrimp 
sauce or parsley sauce. If you have no 
sauce, a little more milk and margarine 
may be used. Replace the mixture in 
the potato and cover with the pieces 
which have been previously removed, re- 
heat and serve hot. 

VARIATIONS 

1. A variation of this is to line the 
scooped-out potato with the mashed 
potato mixture. Then break a fresh egg 
carefully into the center and bake until 
just set. 

2. Another variation would be to use 
a fillet of cooked fish cooked with well- 
flavored white sauce instead of an egg.

sired, the finely-sliced onion. Cook 
gently for 10 minutes, carefully stirring 
occasionally. Serve hot. 

SCALLOPED POTATOES AND 
CHEESE 

Arrange a layer of sliced raw or 
boiled potatoes in greased baking dish 
and sprinkle with grated cheese and a 
little flour. Repeat until dish is nearly 
full. Pour milk over the whole, about 
one-half cup to every three potatoes. 
Skim milk is good. Bake in a moderate 
oven until done. The length of time 
required depends upon whether the pota- 
toes are raw or boiled and whether the 
baking dish used is deep or shallow. 
Boiled potatoes baked in a shallow dish 
will take only 20 minutes. Raw potatoes 
in a deep dish may take as much as 1^4 
hours. 

MASHED POTATOES

RICE 



PLAIN BOILED WHITE RICE 

Contributed by C. E. Grosjean Rice 
Milling Company. 

After washing the white rice in cold 
water until the water clears, using one 
part of rice to one and three-fourths 
parts of cold water for cooking, bring- 
ing to the boiling point quickly, then 
slow fire down just so it does not boil 
over, cook ten minutes. Then turn very 
low, to steam twenty-five minutes. Do 
not stir, nor add more water, nor un- 
cover. When done leave in kettle until 
serving. A flat bottom black iron 
porcelain-lined heavy kettle is preferred. 
Seasoning of any kind tends to destroy 
the natural sweetness and delicate flavor. 
Rice should be eaten plain. 

PLAIN BOILED NATURAL RICE 

Using one part brown or natural rice 
to three parts cold water, bringing to 
boiling point quickly, then slow fire 
down just so that it does not boil over, 
cook forty minutes; do not stir, nor add

more water, nor uncover. When done 
leave in kettle until serving. A flat- 
bottom black iron porcelain-lined heavy 
kettle is preferred. Seasoning of any 
kind tends to destroy the natural sweet- 
ness and delicate flavor. Rice should be 
eaten plain as a vegetable, with meat, 
fish or beans.

Preservation of Fruits and Vegetables 



PRESERVATION OF VEGETABLES 
CANNING VEGETABLES 

1. Make a false bottom to fit inside 
an ordinary wash-boiler. This bottom 
may be a piece of heavy wire ^netting or 
a wooden grating. 

2. Prepare the vegetables as for cook- 
ing and in convenient form for placing 
in the cans. Root vegetables should be 
brushed clean, peeled and cut into con- 
venient slices or pieces. Green beans 
should have their strings removed and 
then be cut into short lengths. Peas 
should be shelled. Corn should be cut 
off the cob. Squash should be peeled. 
Peppers should be scalded and the skins 
and seeds removed, and the flesh cut up 
into small pieces. Asparagus should be 
blanched or parboiled by dipping into 
boiling water for about three minutes 
immediately before canning. Artichokes 
should have some of the outside bracts 
removed and the hard tip cut off with a 
sharp knife. 

3. The prepared vegetables are packed 
tight into the jars or cans which arc 
then completely filled with brine con- 
taining three ounces of salt to a gallon 
of water. Before using, this brine should 
be acidified with lemon juice or vinegar. 
For corn ten fluid ounces (about one and 
one-half teacups) of lemon juice should 
be used to a gallon of brine, for beans 
and peas seven fluid ounces (about one 
teacup), and for other vegetables five 
fluid ounces (about three-fourths of a tea- 
cup). If ordinary vinegar is used, about 
twice these quantities are necessary. 
The acidified brine should be poured hot 
onto the vegetables. ^ 

4. The filled cans and jars are then 
placed, with their covers in place but 
loose, on the false bottom of the boiler. 
Hot water is then poured into the boiler 
until it reaches to about three-fourths of 
the height of the jars. A second tier may 
be placed on ^ rack resting on the first 
tier. 

5. The boiler is then covered and 
heated to boiling, for one hour for most 
vegetables. Pumpkins, beans and corn 
require two hours. 

6. After this heating remove and seal 
quickly, while still boiling hot, by 
screwing down the tops of the jars or 
applying the wax to the cans. 

This is a thoroughly safe and satisfac- 



tory way of preserving vegetables. With 
some vegetables the acid may be omitted, 
but in this case two or three repeated 
heatings are necessary and this lowers 
the quality of the food to some extent.. 
Reheating ^is not practicable with wax- 
top cans. 

PRESERVATION OF FRUITS 

Sugar is scarce — so scarce in fact that 
it is no longer possible to buy the larger 
amount for canning, that was allowed 
earlier this year. 

Fruits are so necessary to health that 
it would be a great mistake to go with- 
out them entirely, because of the lack of 
sugar. They should be canned without 
sugar rather than not be canned at alL 

Meet this situation by canning fruits 
and fruit juices without sugar. This may 
be successfully done by the "cold pack 
method." They will keep as well, if not 
better. They may be made up in 
sauces, jellies or syrups, as they are 
needed. 

Limit the amount of jellies and pre- 
serves you use. 

In making these, substitute com 
syrup for a part of the sugar. (Sec 
directions below.) 

CANNING FRUIT 

1. Make a false bottom to fit inside 
an ordinary stove wash-boiler. This bot- 
tom may be a piece of heavy wire screen 
or a wooden grating. 

2. Prepare the' fruit by peelingj, cor- 
ing, and pitting as -needed. 

COLD-PACK METHOD 

3. Pack the fruit as prepared directly 
into the jars or cans. 

4. Complete the filling of the cans 
with hot water, sugar syrup, or grape 
syrup. Jars should be warmed first to 
avoid cracking. 

The fruit will keep equally well which- 
ever liquid is used. The addition or the 
amount of sugar is a matter of taste. It 
can be added later when the fruit is 
used. The usual sugar syrup for apri- 
cots, peaches, plums and berries is made 
by dissolving 3^ pounds of sugar in a 
gallon of water. For apples, pears, 
quinces, prunes, and cherries 2^ pounds 
of sugar to the gallon is sufficient. If 



122 



BRIDE'S COOK BOOK 



neutral 65* grape syrup is used, from 5^ 
to 3y2 pounds should be used per gallon 
of water. 

5. Place the full cans or jars with 
loose covers on the false bottom in the 
wash boiler, adding water to about two- 
thirds their height. With cans boiling 
water is best; with jars it should be 
simply warm. A second tier may be 
placed on a wooden rack resting on top 
of the first tier. 

6. Place the cover on the boiler and 
heat to boiling. The boiling should con- 
tinue for twenty minutes for apricots, 
free-stone peaches, plums, berries, apples 
and cherries. For pears, cling-stone 
peaches, and unripe fruits, thirty minutes 
are necessary to cook the fruit. 

7. The tops of the jars should be 
screwed down tight while still boiling 
hot and placed upside down or lying 
down on a table to cool. Wax-top cans 
should be removed quickly and sealed 
while boiling hot. 

HOT-PACK METHOD 

By this method, the fruit after prepara- 
tion is cooked in an open pot with the 
water or syrup. When cooked suth- 
ciently it is simply ladled while still boil- 
ing hot, into the cans or jars, which are 
then sealed immediately. Jars must be 
heated by placing in boiling water before 
being filled. 

In this way a larger quantity of solid 
fruit can be packed into a jar or can. 
The liquid remaining in the cooking pot 
may be used to cook a second lot of 
fruit. 



PRESERVATION OF FRUIT 
JUICES 

PRELIMINARY TREATMENT OF 
FRUIT 

Cut and crush apples, peel oranges and 
lemons, stem grapes, use berries as re- 
ceived. Heat slowly to 140°. Red grapes 



should stand about 12 hours after heat- 
ing to extract color. Use a thermometer. 
Do not heat citrus fruits. 

EXTRACTION OF JUICE 

The juice of berries and soft fruits can 
be squeezed through a cloth bag. Apples, 
pears and most grapes require a small 
press. Citrus juices are best extracted 
by means of a lemon cone. 
CLEARING THE JUICE 

Strain several times through a cloth 
bag. Standing for 12 hours before 
straining will settle some of the sedi- 
ment. A slight cloudiness does not in- 
jure the flavor. 

FILLING BOTTLES AND TYING 
CORKS 

Scald bottles and fill with the cleared 
juice to within V/i inches of the mouth. 
Close with corks which have been boiled 
in water for ten minutes and tie down 
corks with string. Ordinary preserving 
jars may also be used. Seal the jars after 
filling. 

STERILIZING 

Place the bottles on their sides or 
corks down in a boiler with enough 
water to cover them. A screen at the 
bottom of the boiler will prevent break- 
ing. Heat the water to 180° F. and keep 
at this temperature for 15 minutes. 
Higher or longer heating injures the 
flavor. 

PARAFFINING THE CORKS 

Remove the bottles, stand on end, dry 
the corks with a towel and when nearly 
cold dip the ends of the necks of the 
bottles into melted paraffin. Store up- 
right in a cool place. . 

SEALING WITH CROWN CAPS 

If much juice is to be made crown 
caps are better than corks. They re- 
quire special bottles and capping ma- 
chine. The bottles, filled with warm 
juice, are capped before sterilizing.

How to Make Jellies and Marmalades 



Just how best to use corn syrup in 
preserving and jelly making, is a ques- 
tion frequently asked. Herein is the 
reason for its use as well as the best 
way to use it always in combination 
with sugar. 

Its use makes the product, whether 
preserves, jelly, marmalade or old- 
fashioned jam, much finer and smoother 
in texture, of far fruitier and richer 
flavor, as well as serving to prevent the 
hardening of the fruit and the crystaliza- 
tion of the sugar. In other words, corn 
syrup gives a better product with better 
keeping qualities. 

Here, then, is a distinct addition to our 
preserving methods. It has been prac- 
ticed in Great Britain for many years 
and England and Scotland produce the 
finest preserves, use large quantities and 
serve them in many ways. 

The secret of their success lies in the 
blending of corn syrup with sugar — 
equal weight of each is used — to make 
a ^ syrup. 

Some fruits make better jelly than 
others; this because of the pectin in 
them. 

Currants, sour apples, crab apples, 
raspberries, blackberries, blueberries, 
partly ripened grapes and quinces make 
good jelly; peaches, pears, strawberries 
and cherries are deficient in certain sub- 
stances necessary to produce a jelly of 
good consistency and flavor. This de- 
ficiency may be overcome, however, by 
combining these juices with those that 
make good jelly. 

A fruit juice that is good for making 
jelly is one that contains pectin, the es- 
sential jelly-making substance. Juices 
extracted b>r cooking are apparently far 
richer in this substance than juices ex- 
tracted from the raw fruit. To determine 
whether a juice contains pectin, one or 
two tablespoonsful of the hot juice 
should be mixed thoroughly with an 
equal volume of grain alcohol (90 to 95 
per cent), and the mixture should be 
cooled. If pectin is present, a gelatin- 
ous mass, which can be gathered on a 
spoon, will appear in the liquid. 

MATERIALS USED OR REQUIRED 

The Fruit — Sorted, mashed and ready 

for putting up. 
Com Sjrrup — An ample supply for the 

season's requirements. It keeps per- 



fectly, does not crystalize; handy to 
have on hand. 
Sugar — Sufficient for your needs or the 
allowance that is allotted to you. 
For some purposes brown sugar can 
be substituted for granulated, but 
the latter is preferable. 
Utensils Required — Preserving kettle, 
enameled preferred, but lacking this 
aluminum or tin can be substituted. 
Wooden spoons — for stirring the 
mixture. 

Cotton bag for straining jelly. 
Jars — Glass, plain or screw top, or 
stone jars. 

Covers and rubbers for screw top 
glass jars. 

Paraffin and heavy paper for cov- 
ering either plain glass or stone jars. 
Labels — to indicate kind of fruit in 
the jar and date of putting up. 
All utensils must be perfectly clean. 
Jars must be freshly cleaned and scalded. 
Jelly bags sterilized. 

It is a controversial point if the jam, 
jelly, marmalade or preserves should be 
covered v/hile hot or left to become 
cold. Both courses are recommended by 
experts. In days gone by an excellent 
product was made and left until cold, 
then covered with tissije paper dipped 
in brandy, and a tightly tied-down cover 
of white paper dipped in white of egg. 
It must always be stored in a cool, dry 
place. 

RULES FOR MAKING JAMS, JEL- 
LIES OR MARMALADES 

1. Observe the strictest cleanliness. 

2. Use fresh, ripe and dry fruit, a bit 
under-ripe is preferable. 

3. Allow generally 54 pound of sweet- 
ening to each pound of fruit. 

4. Have steady but bright fire. Boil 
continuously and fast, skim and stir 
frequently. 

5. Do not fill the preserving kettle 
too full. 

6. A good test to ascertain if it is 
cooked sufficiently is to allow some 
juice to drop from the spoon, and when 
it sheets off— ^r sets — it is cooked 
enough. 

AMOUNT OF WATER ALLOWED 
TO EACH POUND OF FRUIT 



Fruit 
Apple — 



Proportion of Water 
1 gill to 1 pound 



124 



BRIDE'S COOK BOOK 



Apricot 1 gill to 1 pound 

Blackberry None 

Cherry „ 

— 1 gill red currant juice to each pound 

Carrot Enough to cover carrot 

Currant, red None, mash a bit 

Currant, black J/^ gill to 1 pound 

Damson None 

Grape (unripe) None 

Greengage None 

Gooseberry 1 gill to 1 pound 

Plum None 

Quince and Apple 

..Water enough to cover bottom of pan 

Raspberry None 

Strawberry None 

Rhubarb 54 gill to 1 pound 

As a rule, the procedure is as follows, 
though in special recipes other methods 
may be advised: 

Place the prepared fruit in a kettle 
and simmer for a few minutes. Add the 
sugar and cook gently until it has dis- 
solved. This is important, for if al- 
lowed to boil before it is dissolved the 
jam will be thin. When the sugar has 
dissolved, add the corn syrup — equal 
weight, pound for pound to the sugar — 
then boil fast. This again is important, 
as otherwise the product, whether jam, 
jelly or marmalade, will not be of good 
color. 

Stir well and skim with a silver spoon. 
When sugar is of good quality and clean 
fruit is used, there should not be very 
much scum. 

TIME 

The length of time for boiling will 
depends on the kind of fruit used, as 
well as on its condition, whether wet, 
ripe or unripe. Roughly, forty minutes 
is the time from when the fruit com- 
mences to boil, but after about twenty- 
five minutes it is wise to test by placing 
a very little in a saucer. If it sets, it is 
done; if you think it is done, put it on 
a cool part of the stove while you wait 
for test saucer to cool. Otherwise it 
may become over-cooked. 

PRESERVING IN SYRUP 

Another method, and many jam mak- 
ers prefer this, is to first make a blended 
syrup and then cook the fruit in it. For 
example: equal weight of sugar and corn 
syrup; add half a pint of water and dis- 
solve it by gentle heat. Then boil for 
half an hour, add the fruit and boil 
quickly until the jam jellies, allowing ^ 
pound of blended syrup to each pound 
of fruit.

PREPARATION OF COFFEE 

In the preparation of coflfee the follow- 
ing rules should always be observed: 

1 — To make coffee to perfection, you 
must use one tablespoonful of good cof- 
fee for each cup and one for the pot. 

2 — The water must be fresh drawn 
from the faucet and let come to a boil, 
because water that has once been boiled 
has lost a large amount of the air or 
oxygen it contains. 

3 — The percolation method is best; 
coffee, preferably, should not be boiled, 
but if you must boil it, do not boil it over 
five minutes or a bitter concoction of 
tannin results. 

4 — The infusion must be drunk soon 
after making or its aroma and fine flavor 
are missed. 

5 — Whatever pot is used, it must be 
strictly clean and scalded with hot water 
so that it is thoroughly heated through- 
out. 

6 — To obtain the full aroma and flavor, 
the coffee must be freshly roasted and 
ground. 

LADIES LUNCHEON COFFEE 

Put in strainer of a percolator, a heap- 
ing tablespoonful of finely ground coffee 
for every ordinary size cup of coffee, 
press the coffee down in the strainer 
slightly, and pour on your required 
amount of boiling water; put the lid on 
the strainer and leave the water to filter 
through. Add to coffee, when serving, to 
two parts coffee, one part hot milk and a 
tablespoonful of whipped cream, which 
will float on top of coffee, adding to it a 
rich flavor and a very inviting appear- 
ance. When you prepare coffee after this 
recipe, you will have a very delicious cof- 
fee, such as served in all first-class cafes 
of Europe. 



poured in saucer with sugar and then ig- 
nited, leaving the spirits burn out. Some- 
times it is diluted with hot water. 



FRENCH DRIP COFFEE 
NOIR" 



'CAFE 



For every one ordinary cup, take two 
tablespoonfuls of finely ground coffee, 
which press down slightly in the strainer, 
then pour on your boiling hot water, put 
lid on strainer and leave water to filter 
through. When the water is all filtered 
through, you have "Cafe Noir," a very 
strong black coffee which is usually 
drunk with brandy, the latter being 



MILK COFFEE OR 
LAIT" 



'CAFE AU 



Prepare the coffee the same as "Cafe 
Noir," with a little chicory added, about 
three ounces chicory to the pound of cof- 
fee, and when serving, add to it an equal 
amount of hot milk. When serving "Cafe 
au Lait" in the French cafes, the waiter 
brings the coffee pot in one hand and the 
vessel containing hot milk in the other 
and pours into the cup from both vessels 
at the same time. These recipes are fol- 
lowed in all the prominent cafes in Paris. 

COFFEE BOILED 

Take one tablespoonful medium ground 
coffee to a cup, and one for the pot. Draw 
fresh water from the faucet, boil in kettle 
for five minutes, pour the water on cof- 
fee in pot and allow it to steep for five 
minutes, then remove the grounds from 
the liquor, and you can use it several 
hours afterwards. 

ICED COFFEE 

1 Quart Strong Coffee 

% Cup Yellow Corn Syrup 
Cream to Make Good Color 
Serve with cracked ice. 

DIRECTIONS FOR CLARIFYING 
COFFEE 

Egg shells may be saved and used for 
clearing coffee. Three egg shells are suf- 
ficient to effect clearing where one cup 
of brown coffee is used, an egg broken 
and slightly beaten may be diluted with a 
little cold water and mixed with the cof- 
fee. This gives a particularly rich flavor. 

HOW TO MAKE TEA 

2 Teaspoons Tea 

2 Cups Boiling Water 

Scald an Earthen or China Teapot 

Put in tea, and pour on boiling water. 
Let stand on back of range or in a warm 
place five minutes. Strain and serve im- 
mediately, with or without sugar and 
milk. Avoid second steeping of leaves 
with addition of a few fresh ones. If this 
is done, so large an amount of tannin is 
extracted that various ills arc apt to 
follow.

The Conservation Foods of Flavor 




What You Ought to Know About Canned Foods in General 
and DEL MONTE Products in Particular 

|0 USE canned food products intelligently, economically and to the 
best advantage, every housewife should know something of the 
processes involved in their commercial production. Canning is the 
method by which food is preserved. In its highest development it 
is the preservation of food in as nearly its natural condition as 
possible, or in the condition in which it is generally used. 

This is accomplished solely through the use of that great 
natural sterilizing agent — heat — and heat alone. There are no 
artificial preservatives of any kind needed or used in canning fruits 
and vegetables. Each product is processed, hermetically sealed in cans and then 
heated to the temperature and for the time required to secure perfect sterilization 
for each individual variety. This simplicity of method makes canning at once 
the safest, cheapest and most successful way to keep food in perfect condition 
until it is needed. 

In principle there is no real difference between home and commercial canning. 
But the large canner has in reality many advantages over the housewife, all of 
which make for greater certainty of results and uniformity of quality. His first- 
hand choice of raw materials, his equipment for handling them in large quantities 
by special machinery, his accurate devices for grading as to size and quality, his 
standardized methods of processing, canning and sterilizing, as well as his exact- 
ing sanitary precautions in the handling and packing of each product, all give 
him an immeasurable advantage over the woman in the kitchen. 

Quality in canned foods really begins with the production of the material — in 
the proper selection of variety and seed and in exercising a supervision and 
control over every stage in the growth, cultivation, harvest and delivery of the 
fresh fruits and vegetables to the canning kitchens. 

The raw product must be of first class quality in every respect, uniform in 
size and development, and at just the proper stage of ripeness or maturity, to 
secure the best results. 

And after it is delivered, it must be carefully graded both for quality and 
size. In canning eternal vigilance is the price of quality, and only long experience 
equips men to select that which is suitable and reject that which is unfit. 

Why DEL MONTE Quality is Highest Quality 

The DEL MONTE ideal of quality in canned foods traces its origin to the 
early days of California. 

Long before the transcontinental railway was built — ^when settlers were still 
making their way slowly across the country in prairie schooners or sailing 'round 
the Horn— the founders of the DEL MONTE business were already in California, 
canning and preserving the golden harvests of its most fertile valleys. 

They were the first in the field. 

They began as pioneers — in a new land and in a comparatively new industry 
— with very little capital but with a big ideal — an ideal, which, backed by the 
determined spirit of '49, has revolutionized the canning business and given the 
whole world better things to eat. 

That ideal was to can the finest fruits and vegetables grown, and so to perfect 
the processes of canning that the finished product should retain its full natural 
flavor and freshness. 

They believed that the way to secure the finest fruits and vegetables was to 
locate their canneries in those sections where soil and climate combined to produce 
Nature's best. And they believed further that, to preserve that natural goodness 
at its best, the ripe fruits should be "packed where they ripen the day they 
are picked." 

That was the principle upon which the DEL MONTE business was started 
nearly 60 years ago. And that is the principle upon which it has grown and 
developed until today the California Packing Corporation is the largest canner 
of fruits and vegetables in existence and DEL MONTE Quality is recognized 
the world over as the standard of excellence in foods. 

A Far Search for DEL MONTE Flavor 

Fine flavor in fruits and vegetables is what "good breeding" is in people. 
One is just as much a matter of careful cultivation as the other. Both are 
developed only under the most favorable environment. 

3A 



Del Monte Canned Fruits and Vegetables 



That explains why DEL MONTE'S 89 model canneries are situated in the 
most favored spots of Nature — each location selected for its special fitness to 
produce certain products of finer flavor and finer quality than can be grown any- 
where else. 

It explains further why the California Packing Corporation owns and operates 
thousands of acres of the most highly developed orchards and gardens in these 
favored sections — ^why the specialists who prepare DEL MONTE Products have 
spent their lives in improving old varieties and propagating new ones to perfect 
DEL MONTE Quality — why, in short, they devote their most vigilant attention 
to every stage in the growth, harvest and preparation of DEL MONTE Products, 
from the planting of the seed until the perfectly flavored fruits and vegetables 
are ready to be served on your table. 

Please do not confuse the delicious flavor of DEL MONTE California Canned 
Fruits with some varieties of fresh California fruit, which are necessarily picked 
green and allowed to ripen on their long journey to market. For DEL MONTE 
Fruits are always matured and sun-ripened on the tree. And they retain all the 
fine flavor and delicate bouquet that kindest Nature can impart, because they 
are "packed where they ripen the day they are picked." 

That is why you will find DEL MONTE model kitchens in the richest pine- 
apple-growing sections of far-off Hawaii — in the fertile California delta lands of 
the Sacramento river where grows the world's finest asparagus — in the finest 
peach orchards of the San Joaquin valley — among the famous apricot and prune 
orchards of the Santa Clara valley — in the raisin vineyards of Fresno — in Alaska, 
from whose cold, northern waters the choicest salmon are caught — as well as in 
all the other widely scattered locations where each particular variety develops 
its finest flavor and form. 

And it is the same with DEL MONTE pears, plums, berries, cherries, grapes, 
beans, peas, tomatoes and all the other delicious varieties included in the DEL 
MONTE line. All are grown where they attain their finest flavors. In each is 
that delicious flavor preserved intact. 

The DEL MONTE Label Your Guarantee of Quality 

It is this strict adherence to an ideal established years ago, this painstaking 
attention to every detail in the preparation of the long line of DEL MONTE 
Products, that make the red DEL MONTE shield on the green can your absolute 
guarantee of finest quality in canned fruits, vegetables and other food products. 

That is why America's millions of discriminating women are careful to 
specify DEL MONTE when they order canned foods from their grocers, and why 
so many grocers take pains to recommend DEL MONTE to their customers 
who want the best. 

Recognition 

In competition with leading brands from all parts of the world, DEL MONTE 
Products have received highest awards and diplomas at the world's greatest ex- 
positions, both at home and abroad, including the following: 1904 at the Louisiana 
Purchase Exposition, St. Louis, Missouri; 1906 at the Exposition Internationale 
d'Hygiene, Paris, France; 1909, Golden West Exposition, Earl's Court, London, 
England; 1911, Esposizione Internazionale della Industrie e del Lavaro, Turin, 
Italy; 1915, Panama California Exposition, San Diego, California; and 1915, 
Panama-Pacific International Exposition, San Francisco, California. 

Measurements and Sizes of Containers 

'^^^^ f^^:^!:(^=^^ |EASUREMENTS and quantities of fruits and vegetables have 
been specified herein as 1 cup, V2 cup, etc., rather than 1 can, 
V2 can, etc. It might be well to say, however, that in preparing 
these recipes the generally recognized standard can of each 
particular variety has been used. 

In most fruits, the No. 2^/^ can is the customary size found 
on the grocers' shelves; likewise, for such vegetables as toma- 
toes, pumpkins, etc. Such varieties as string beans, peas, com, 
etc., are ordinarily and commonly sold in what is known as the 

No. 2 can. With proper judgment there should be no difficulty in preparing these 

recipes regardless of the size of can used if instructions are followed as to the 

measurements specified in the recipes. 

A word or two on the size of containers, however, may be of assistance to 

the housewife in purchasing canned products intelligently. 

The most important containers in which DEL MONTE Canned Fruits are 

packed are No. 2^, No. 2 and No. 1 Tall size cans.

'^eliontel 



Wi-0»cLmspt*ci| 




No, 2^4 



No. 2 



No. 1 Tall 



The fruit in such varieties as Apricots, Peaches, Pears and Plums is graded 
for size, the large fruit being packed in No. 2% cans, medium size fruit in No. 2, 
and fruit a trifle smaller in No. 1 Tall. This grading for size does not affect the 
quality in the slightest degree, for, as a matter of fact, the smaller and medium 
sized fruit, when selected for quality and fully tree-ripened, as DEL MONTE is 
packed, is just as delicious as the larger size fruit which goes into No. 2^/^ cans. 

The sizes of cans most customary in packing vegetables are the No. 2^^ and 
the No. 2 round cans. Asparagus is largely packed in square cans, the long spears 
in No. 2^/^ and the short spears or tips in the No. 1 can. There are various i&tyles 
of smaller containers used for such varieties as Tomato Sauce, Green Chile 
Peppers, Pimientos, etc., which the consumer soon becomes acquainted with and 
accustomed to, when purchasing such commodities. 

The net contents will always be found specified on the labels. There is some 
variation, according to the variety of the product, but generally speaking the 
No. 2^/^ round can, shown above, will contain from 27 to 30 ounces net; the No. 2, 
from 18 to 20 ounces and the No. 1 Tall about 15 ounces. 

General Directions 

Level measurements should be used in all the recipes contained herein. Each 
recipe is large enough to serve six moderate-sized portions. 

The sirup from DEL MONTE Canned Fruits may be used as sauce for 
puddings, fritters and pancakes; it is delicious in fruit punches and lemonade; 
it may be substituted for the liquid in frostings and icings and will conserve a 
portion of the sugar; it may be frozen for a sherbet, or heated and poured over

The liquid from DEL MONTE Canned Vegetables should never be thrown 
away. It may be used as the basis for soups, as the liquid in cream or white 
sauce, and it will give additional flavor to all meat and vegetable stews. 

As this liquid is rich in mineral salts it should always be utilized. By its 
use with the vegetables or in one of the ways mentioned above the full food value 
of the vegetable is retained. 

All bread crusts and stale pieces of bread should be saved, dried, and put 
through the meat chopper to make crumbs.

ing in with a cutting motion and not a stirring motion. The air which has been 
beaten into the egg white is thus prevented from escaping. 

Gelatin should be softened in a small amount of cold water before it is 
dissolved in boiling water. Use in the proportion of V2 cup of cold water for 1 
envelope of gelatin. 

White sauce or cream sauce should be smooth and creamy and free from 
lumps. To prepare it so that it meets all these requirements the following method 
has been found to be uniformly successful: 

Melt the fat, or heat it, if a liquid fat is used. Remove from the fire and 
add the dry ingredients which consist of cornstarch or Victory flour, or any of 
the substitute flours, and the seasonings. When these are thoroughly mixed with 
the fat, add the cold liquid which may be milk or stock or water or a combination 
of two or of the three. Return to the fire and stir constantly until the boiling 
point is reached. Then if it is not to be used at once put in a double. boiler to 
keep hot until ready to serve. The following proportions may be used for the 
two grades of sauce:
