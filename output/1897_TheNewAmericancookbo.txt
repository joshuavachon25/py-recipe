THE 

American Cook Book. 



STOCKS FOR SOUP, GRAVY, ETC. 

Chapter I. 

Stock in some shape or other is the fountlatiou of soups, gravies, etc., and 
on its quality depends almost eutix'ely the excellenee of any cuisine. It may be 
briefly descril>ed as the solution in water of the juices of tlie meat, etc., used in 
its composition, by a long and gentle pi'ocess of simmering; and this essence, 
variously flavored, is the basis of all gravies, sauces, soups, etc. Stocli can be 
made from almost anytliing— fisli, flesh or vegetable; but in all cases the process 
is the same, and its cost depends entirely on tlie requirements and the manage- 
ment of its maker. 

Roughly speaking, stock may be divided into two sorts— white and brown; 
the former made chiefly from white meat, such as veal, rabbit, poultry, etc.; the 
latter from beef, game, etc. 

For ordinary piu'poses a very good stock can be made of broken-up bones, 
cooked or raw, and the trimmings, giblets, etc., of poultry (with or without the 
addition of a little soup-meat), simmered gently for several hoiu's in tlie stock- 
pot. But for high-class cookery, where distinct and delicate flavors are indis- 
pensable, each kind, as white, brown or game, should be made separately, and 
if possible of uncooked meat, bones, etc. 

Sauces and gravies of various kinds, of which the stocks mentioned above 
are the bases, are the indispensable adjuncts of nearly every dish, and must be 
well made to insure its success. Entrees and made dishes depend in great 
measure on the sauces that accompany them. 

In addition to savory sauces, there are also sweet ones, used in conjunction 
with certain meats, and various sweet entremets, specimens of which will be 
found duly given. 

The materials employed in the composition of savory sauces are stock, milk, 
cream, flour, butter, eggs, water, seasonings, etc., and from these are formed the 
standard sauces, which form part or more or less of all the others. 

ECONOMIC STOCK FOR SOUP, GRAVY, ETC. 

Take odds and ends, such as about three or four pounds of cooked or raw 

bones, the rind of bacon that has been scraped, and the necks, cleaned feet, 

gizzards and livers of chickens, chop these up. put with them one or two sliced 

onions, a little sliced carrot, turnip, celery, and leek if you have any, and a few 

herbs, such as thyme, parsley, bay-leaf, and a few peppercorns, into a saucepan, 

9 



10 STOCKS FOR SOUP, GRAVY, ETC. 

first putting a tablespoonful of fat in the bottom of the pan; close these down 
in the saucepan and let them fry until the contents at the bottom are quite 
brown; then cover up the bones with cold water, add a little salt, let it come 
gently to a boil, then sli;im off all tlie scum, and let it simmer steadily for 
three or four hours; be sure it does not boil quickly. When it is done, strain 
off, and when cool, talve off the fat, which can be boiled up in water and clarified 
for other purposes. This gravy should always be kept ready, and requires to be 
boiled up every day during warm weather. The meat taken to clarify stock can 
be used again to make a good, clear, light stock by covering it, when strained, 
with cold water and boiling it gently. The bones can be boiled two or three 
times for light stock. (See clear soup.) 

FISH STOCKS. 

Take the bones of any white fish, such as soles, whiting, cod, etc., whether 
raw or cooked, with any fish trimmings, lobster-shell, shrimps' heads and tails, 
etc., and lay them in a pan, with a dessert-spoonful of lenion-juice, one or two 
sliced onions, a bunch of herbs, a few peppercorns and a pinch of salt; cover it 
with cold water, one quart for each pound of fish-bones. Simmer it all gently 
for about an hour, skimming it when it comes to a boil. For fish sauces or 
bisques, this stock will only require to be freed from fat, and strained; for clear 
fish stock, it must be clarified in the usual way, with the whites and shells of 
four eggs to each quart of stoelv. For clear brown fish soups, fry the onions and 
herbs together in a little butter, then lay in the fish-bones (well and carefully 
dried in a cloth), and let all fry together for fifteen minutes; it should then be 
covered with cold water, and finished off like the clear fish stock given above. 

GAME STOCK. 

Take any kind of poultry or game bones, fresh or I'oast; fresh are best. Put 
two ounces of butter or fat into a stew-pan, with two onions cut up into little 
dice shapes, one large leek, one carrot, a little celery, one turnip, a good bunch of 
herbs (thyme, parsley, bay-leaf, basil and marjoram), two or three fresh mush- 
rooms if you have them, and a pinch of mignonette pepper. Place the bones 
on this, cover the pan, and fry the contents all together for about twenty to 
thirty minutes, taking care they do not burn. Then cover them well with stock 
(any stock from veal, rabbit or chicken, such as above, can be used), let it come 
to a boil then strain, and let it simmer gently for two or three hours. Strain off 
when cold, remove any fat, and use. Clarify the stock with either rabbit, hare 
or beef, allowing half a pound of raw beef and four whites of eggs to each quart 
of stock. The meat should be chopped fine and mixed with the whites before 
being put into the soup, stir together occasionally till it boils, then simmer gently 
for about an hour, and strain. 

WHITE STOCK. 

Take about twenty-five cents' worth of veal-bones, or the bones of rabbit or 
chicken, put them into a pan, with two or three sliced onions, a pinch of salt, 
small bunch of herbs— thyme, parsley and bay-leaf— about six peppercorns, black 
and white, and two cloves. Cover with cold water; let it come to a boil, then 
skim, and cover up the pan, and boil gently for about one hour and a half, strain 
off, remove the fat, and use. 




Chapter II, 
AMERICAN SAUCE. 

Put half a pound of game or poultry boues into a stew-pan, with one ounce 
of butter, half a sliced onion, one or two bay-leaves, six crushed peppercorns, one 
sliced tomato and one fresh mushroom; cover up, and let these fry on the stove 
for about twenty minutes; then add one wine-glassful of white wine, a few 
drops of carmine and a pint of brown sauce; let it boil for fifteen to twenty 
minutes, keeping it slvimmed during the boiling; then strain through the tammy, 
and mix in it a dessert-spoonful of chopped fresh mushrooms and a dust of red 

pepper; boil up, and serve. 

ANCHOVY CEEAM. 

Wash and bone six anchovies, and pound them, with one yolk of hard-boiled 
egg, one tablespoonful of salad-oil, a dust of red pepper and a few drops of 
carmine; when smooth, add half a gill of liquid aspic jelly, and rub through a 
tammy. Mix this puree with a gill of stiffly whipped cream, and use when ice- 
cold. 

ANCHOVY SAUCE FOR FISH. 

Take the bones from four anchovies, and pound them in a mortar to a paste, 
with one ounce of butter. Set on the stove in a saucepan sufficient butter to 
make half a plot when melted, stir into it the pounded anchovies, a sprinkle of 
pepper and the juice of half a small lemon; boil one minute, and send to the 
table very hot. Serve with turbot or soles. 

APPLE SAUCE. 

Pare one dozen best apples, stew until tender, stir in one tablespoonful of 

butter, one teacupful of sugar, the juice of one lemon and a little grated nutmeg.

12 SAUCES. 

AETICHOKE SAUCE. 

Put a piece of butter the size of an egg iuto a saucepan, let it melt, put 
iuto it a sliced onion, half a head of celery, a tablespoonful of chopped ham, a 
pinch of powdered cinnamon, a salt-spoonful of salt and a little cayenne; stir 
the ingredients constantly over a fire gently for a quarter of an hour, adding 
more butter, if necessary; then add to them a pound of Jerusalem articholves, 
boiled and beaten to a pulp, and a pint of milk, boil all together until the 
sauce is rather thicker than cream; strain, boil again, and serve hot. Boil the 
ingredients together ten minutes. Sufficient for rather more than a pint of 
sauce. 

ASPARAGUS SAUCE. 

Boil one bunch of asparagus; when tender, cut in pieces; stew in a teacupful 
of cream, Avith salt and pepper; thicken with butter rolled in flour. To be 
served with any delicate fish. 

ASPIC CREAM. 

Take half a pint of liquid aspic jelly, one gill of thick, fresh cream, then add 
a dessert-spoonful of tarragon vinegar; tamiuy, and use when cooling for mask- 
ing chicken, etc. 

ASPIC JELLY. 

Take a handful of aromatic herbs, such as burnet, chervil and tarragon, boil 
them in white vinegar; when the vinegar is well scented, pour into the stew-pan 
some consomme of fowl, reduced; season well before you clarify. When the aspic 
is highly seasoned, break the whites of four eggs into an earthen pan, and beat 
them with an osier rod; throw the aspic into the whites of eggs, and put the 
whole on the fire in a stew-pan; keep beating or stirring till the jellj' gets white; 
it is then very near boiling. Put it on the corner of the stove, with a cover over 
it, and a little fire on the top of it. When quite clear and bright, strain it through 
a bag, or sieve, or naplvin, to be used when wanted. Or if this is wanted for a 
mayonnaise, or as a jelly in molds, make sure of its being stiff enough. Then put 
a knuckle of veal in a small stock-pot, a small part of a knuckle of ham and two 
calf feet, some trimming of fowl or game. Season this with onions, carrots and 
a bunch of herbs Avell seasoned, and moisten with good broth; let it boil gently 
for four hours, then skim away all the fat, and drain it through a silken sieve; 
put that into a stew-pan. with two s])oonfuls of tarragon vinegar and four whites 
of eggs, salt and pepper, to clarify; keep stirring it over the fire until the whole 
becomes very white, then put this on the side, Avith a little fire over the cover; 
Avhen you find it clear, drain it in a cloth or jelly-bag. and use it for aspic; if not, 
do not put in any vinegar; jelly for pie or galantine does not require acid. 

BAIN-MARIE SAUCE OR STEW PAN. 

Tlie bain-marie is a shalloAV A'essel, generally made of copper, which is used 
for keeping sauces, stews, etc., hot when they are already sufficiently cooked, 
and Avhen it is not convenient tliat they should be immediately served. It will 
be found most A^aluable in those families where regularity and punctuality in 
meals cannot be depended upon, as it affords the best means of keeping dishes 
hot Avithout destroying their flaA'or or burning them. When it is to be used, the 



SAUCES. 13 

bain-marie should be filled with boiling -water, and the pans containing the 
sauces or entrees should be put inio it elosely covered. It should then be put 
.upon a hot plate, or by tJie side of the fire, to keep up tlie heat of the water 
without allowing it to boll, and should there remain until the dishes are wanted. 
Tiio principle of the bain-marie may be adapted for Ivceping sauces and gravies 
warm wlien a proper pan is not at hand. Instead of retaining the compound 
slowly simmering by the side of the fire in the pan in which it was made, by 
which means it would, in all probability, be either smoked, burned or rendered 
flavorless, put it into a basin or jar, cover it closely, aud place it in a pan of 
boiling water. If the Avater is allowed to boil, the sauce or gravy will become 
too thick. 

BECHAMEL SAUCE (CREAMY). 

Put one and a half ounces of fine fiour aud the same of butter to fry together 
without discoloring, then mix with it a half pint of milk flavored as in recipe 
for thick bechamel, stir together till it boils, then add a gill of single cream and 
a little seasoning, tammy, aud use. Tliis sauce is excellent for serving with 
boiled chicken, etc. 

BECHAMEL SAUCE (THICK). 

Half a pint of milk boiled with a little mace and half a shallot; mix onto 
two ounces of flour which have been lightly fried with two ounces of butter, 
stir until it boils, add a little red pepper aud salt, tammy, and use. 

BEARNAISE 'SAUCE. 

Three tablespoonfuls of tarragon vinegar, the yolks of two eggs and one halt 
pound of butter; put the vinegar into a small saucepan over a modcn-ate fire, let 
it boil until reduced to one spoonful, then put in the yolks aud a small piece of 
butter, stir continually Avith a wooden spoon or small egg-whip. As soon as tlie 
first piece of l)utter is melted, take from the fire; put in a second piece, and stir 
until melted; continue this until the whole amount of butter is melted; put over 
the fire again for one minute, add a teaspoonful of fresh tarragon, chopped fine. 
You must be careful in doing this sauce, for it will brealc very easily; in case 
of breaking, add a little cold water, drop by drop, until the sauce comes right 
again. Care must be taken not to cook the yolk, as it will cause the sauce to 
break. This sauce may be served with steak. 

A. J. Pillauet, Chef West Hotel, Minneapolis, Minnesota. 

BORDEAUX SAUCE. 

2 gallons of cabbage, cut fine, 1 ounce of ground ginger, 

1 gallon of green tomatoes, sliced, 1 ounce of ground black pepper, 
1 dozen sliced onions, i^ pound of white mustard-seed, 

1 oiuice of turmeric-powder, 1% pounds of Avhite sugar, 

1 ounce of celery-seed, 1 gill of salt, 

1 ounce of whole allspice, 1 gallon of vinegar, 

1 ounce of cloves. 

Mix all, and boil fifteen or twenty minutes.

SAtrCES. 



BREAD S'AUCE. 
Oue cupful of stale bread -crumbs, one oniou, two ounces of butter, pepper, 
salt and mace. Cut the onions very fine and boil in sweet milk, then strain on 
the bread, and let stand half an hour; put into a saucepan, with onion, pepper, 
salt and butter; boil. Serve with goose, ducli or any Ivind of game. 

BROWN CHESTNUT SAUCE. 

This is made in the same way as white chestnut sauce, excepting brown 
gravy is used instead of milk; this is usually served with roasted fowl, and 
seasoned rather more highly than the white sauce. 

BROWN ONION SAUCE. 

Fry the onions in butter and a dash of sugar to a nice brown; thicken a little 
with "brown roux" or flour, and add enough strong beef gravy to make a thick 
sauce. Season with cayenne or black pepper, and rub through a sieve. Very 
nice with roasted goose or pork.

Rubbing Sauces through the Tammy. 

BROWN SAUCE. 

Fry four ounces of flour, four ounces of butter and four ounces of tomatoes 
till a good brown color; then add two quarts of good-flavored stock made from 
<?ooked meat-bones, stir till it boils, and let it boil till reduced one fourth, keeping 
it well skimmed; then, when quite free from fat, tammy. This sauce may always 
he kept ready for use by being boiled up once or twice a week. 

BROWN SAUCE. 

Melt and stir one ounce of butter over the fire until brown, thicken with a 
tablespoonful of flour and mix smooth, thin with half a pint of boiling stock; 
add one finely chopped onion, a small carrot, a sprig each of parsley, thyme and 
sweet marjoram, a blade of mace, a little black pepper and salt. Simmer for 
ten minutes, then strain, and stir in a tablespoonful of Worcestershire sauce, a 
tablespoonful each of tomato, mushroom and walnut catchup, with the juice of 
one lemon, stir until thoroughly mixed. Serve with beefstealv, mutton chops 
and warmed-over meats. 



SAUCES. 15 

CAPER SAUCE (BROWN). 
Take some thick brown sauce, adding the vinegar the capers are pickled in; 
season it highly with cayenne and salt. Put capers to the sauce just before 
serving; and they must be used liberally. Nasturtium buds or seeds are some- 
times used as a substitute. 

CAPER SAUCE (WHITE). 

Put whole capers into melted butter, adding a little of the vinegar they are 
pickled in, a pinch of salt, and suflicient cream to make it white. This is used 
principally for boiled mutton. 

CELERY SAUCE. 

Chop the celery fine, and boil it until tender; use only a little water; season 
with one half cupful of cream, one tablespoonful of butter, and salt and pepper 
to suit the taste. 

Mrs. Louisa Ash, Mt. Vernon, Olilo. 

CIIAI'ONAY SAUCE. 
Put two peeled shallots into a stew-pan, with a sliced tomato, a buncli of 
herbs, one mushroom chopped fine, a little piece of bacon-bone, half a pound 
of bones from any birds, one tablespoonful of clarified butter or salad-oil, pinch 
of mignonette pepper, and fry all together for about fifteen minutes. Then add 
one ounce of glaze and three quarters of a pint of good brown sauce; boil all 
together for about a quarter of an hour, and keep skimmed while boiling; 
tammy, and mix in twelve shredded turned olives, a few drops of carmine and 
a quarter of a pint of champagne just before serving. This is an excellent sauce 
for serving with larks, quails, etc. 

CIIAUDFROID (BROWN). 
Three quarters of a pint of aspic, quarter of a pint of tomato sauce, a few 
drops of carmine, half a wine-glassful of sherry, half an ounce of glaze and a 
dust of red pepper; reduce one quarter, keep skimmed wliile boiling, then tammy, 
and use when somewhat cool. 

CHAUDFROID (W^HITE). 
Put together a quarter of a pint of veloute sauce, a quarter of a pint of thick 
cream, half a pint of aspic jelly, and boil till reduced one quarter, keeping it 
well skinmied; tammy, and use when cooling. 

CHILLI SAUCE. 
18 ripe tomatoes, cut fine, 1 cupful of sugar, 

1 green pepper, cut fine, 1 tablespoonful of salt, 

1 onion, cut fine, 2 cupfuls of best vinegar, 

2 tablespoonfuls of all kinds of spices, pulverized. 

Boil, and bottle for use. 

Cousin Lizzie, Girardtown, West Virginia. 

CLARET SAUCE. 
Boil one cupful of sugar and one fourth cupful of water until it thickens 
slightly; cool a little, and add three tablespoonfuls of claret. 

Mrs. Altliea Somes, Teacher of Coolsery, Manual Training School, Boston, Mass. 



16 SAUCES. 

CLARIFIED BUTTER. 
For serviug- with boiled fish, globe artichokes, asparagus, etc. Put half a 
poimd of good butter into a stew-pau and stand on the side of the stove; let it 
boil very gently, keep it continually skimmed Avhile boiliug. but do not allow it 
to discolor; then, when it presents the appearance of clear salad-oil, carefully 
pour it off from the sediment at the bottom of the pan, and serve in a sauce-boat. 
This is also very good for frying cutlets, etc., in. It will require about half au 
hour to clarify, and the above quantity is sufficient for six to eight persons. 

CRANBERRY SAUCE. 

Wash a quart of cranberries, put into a preserve-kettle, with water to cover, 

and stew until the berries break; then strain through a colander, return to the 

kettle, add one and one half pounds of sugar, and stir until it boils; turn out to 

cool. 

CREAM SAUCE. 

Put two tablespoonfuls of hot water and a teacupful of sweet cream into a 
saucepan, stir in one tablespoonful of butter and a little chopped parsley; set 
the saucepan into a kettle of boiling Avater, add a little strained soup stock, let 
boil, take from the fire, and add a tablespoonful of butter. Then pour around 

the hot fish. 

CREAM SAUCE. 

In New York, where salmon is dressed to perfection, cream sauce is a fre- 
quent accompaniment. The cream is made very hot, but not brought quite to 
a boil, seasoned to taste, sometimes with shrimp or anchovy essence, some- 
times with chopped parsley. If for baked salmon, the liquor from the can is 
strained and stirred into it; it requires no thickening. It will be found an 
admirable sauce for fish of almost any kind; capers chopped and added will be 
excellent with codfish— a thoroughly French combination. 

CURRANT SAUCE. 
5 pounds of currants, 1 tablespoonful of cloves, 

3 pounds of sugar, 1 tablespoonful of allspice, 

1 pint of vinegar, 1 tablespoonful of pepper, 

1 tablespoonful of cinnamon, 1 teaspoonful of salt. 

Boil one half hour, and bottle. If preferred, omit the vinegar. 
Mrs. H. H. Himian, Battle Creek, Michigan. 

DEVIL SAUCE. 

Four tablespoonfuls of cold gravy; that from a joint, or. if not to be had, use 
brown stock. 

1 teaspoonful of loaf-sugar, V^ of a lemon, the juice of, 

14 teaspoonful of mustard. 1 ounce of fresh butter. 

1 dessert-spoonful of good mush- Salt and pepper to suit the palate, 
room catchup. 

The pepper should be added cautiously at first; it varies so much in strength, 
it is almost impossible to state the exact quantity. This may be varied consid- 
erably; Worcestershire or any other good sauce can take the place of the 
catchup, and vinegar, plain or flavored with herbs, may be used instead of the 
lemon-juice. 



SAUCES.

DKAWN-BUTTER SAUCE. 

One quai'ter of a pouud of butter, with tAvo teaspoonfuls of flour well mixed 
witli it, j)Ut into a saucepan, witli one half a pint of water or stoelv, cover it, 
and set the saucepan into a larger one fiUed with boiling water; shake it con- 
stantly until thoroughly melted; take it off as soon as it comes to a boil. 
Season with salt and pepper. 

DUTCH SAUCE. 

This sauce is in high repute in France and America; it is served with 
various kinds of tish and vegetables, especially artichokes. It sounds extrav- 
agant, but no one needs much of it, and it is very delicious. To make it, put tlie 
yolks of only two eggs into a jar or jug, and two ounces of fresh butter, with a 
small glassful of water and a little salt and grated nutmeg; set this in a sauce- 
pan of boiling water over tlie fire, and stir until it is thick, but do not let it boil. 
Add, off the fire, a dessert-spoonful of lemon-juice. When for serving with 
calf's head, with which it is very nice, substitute veal gravy for the water. A 
few drops of strong white vinegar may be used instead of lemon-juice. 




EGG SAUCE. 

We tasted recently a delicious egg sauce, in which the yolks were pounded, 
and the whites chopped as usual. A little parsley, chopped tine, had been added, 
and it looked, as well as tasted, very good. The lady who made it sometimes 
uses fennel instead of parsley. 

ESPAGNOL SAUCE. 

Mix three quarters of a pint of brown sauce with one ounce of glaze or a 
teaspoonful of extract of meat, one or two fresh muslirooms, one Avine-glassful 
of slierry, a few drops of carmine and a pinch of castor-sugar; reduce one 
fourth, keep it skmuned while boiling, then tammy, and use. 

EXCELLENT FISH SAUCE.

SAUCES. 



FISH SAUCE. 



14 pint of walnut pickle, 1 dozen shallots, 

14 pint of mushroom catchup, i/4 pint of soy, 
1 dozen anchovies, 1/4 teaspoonful of cayenne pepper. 

Put all the ingredients into a saucepan, having previously chopped the shallots 
and anchovies very fine; let simmer fifteen minutes, strain, and when cold, bottle 
for use, and seal. 

FOWL SAUCE. 

Take scraps of veal, the neclvs and feet of fowls, put into a saucepan, with a 
blade of mace, a few peppercorns, one head of celery, a bunch of sweet herbs, 
the juice of one lemon; put all into a quart of Avater and boil one hour; strain, 
and thicken with half a pound of butter rolled in flour. Mix in a teacupful of 
fresh or canned mushrooms, the beaten yolks of two eggs, with a teacupful of 
cream and half a nutmeg, grated. Shake over the fire until ready to serve. 

FRENCH BECHAMEL SAUCE. 

That popular French white sauce is very easy to make in even ordinary 
households where economy is pi'actised. For instance, in making this on a 
large scale, a whole fowl would probably be boiled down for it, together with a 
knuckle of veal and a piece of lean ham. Proceed, however, as follows: Put 
into a saucepan the bones of a boiled or a roasted fowl, broken small, with any 
scraps of fresh veal and a bit of raw lean ham, or the bones from a piece of 
boiled bacon; add 

A bit of carrot, A few button mushrooms, 

A slice of onion, 1 pint of cold water, 

A tiny bit of mace, A sprig of thyme and parsley, 

A few white peppercorns. 
Simmer until there is onlj' half a pint of liquid, or even less, and if it does 
not taste rich, put in a teaspoonful of gelatin. Stir until that is dissolved, then 
strain the sauce. In a separate saucepan bring to a boil half the measure of 
cream mixed with a small teaspoonful of arrow-root; mix the white stock 
gradually with this, let the whole boil for a few minutes, then serve, adding, 
off the fire, a few drops of lemon-juice or white vinegar, and a little salt. If 
the stock can be allowed to cool before mixing with the cream, the fat will be 
more effectually removed. We have dwelt at some length on this recipe, by 
way of illustrating the fact that people often deprive themselves of nice dishes 
simply because the quantities given in recipes are too great for their needs, and 
they are not sufficiently practical to reduce or alter them to meet their modest 
requirements. We may mention that if the meat and vegetables are allowed to 
stew first in a little butter, Jhe sauce will taste much better. 

FRENCH SAI/AD SAUCE. 

Put half a teaspoonful of salt and pepper each into a bowl, add gradually 
three tablespooufuls of olive-oil. rub aud mix thoroughly, then stir in the 
vinegar by degrees, and it is ready for use.

MAYONNAISE ASPIC. 

Take half a pint of aspic jelly that is not quite set, and mix it into three large 
tablespoonfuls of thick mayonnaise sauce, stirring well together till it begins to 
thicken, then use. To make this softer and better blended, it is advisable to pass 
it through the tammy-cloth before using. 

MAYONNAISE SAUCE. 

For half a pint of mayonnaise sauce, put one raw yolk of egg into a basin, a 
salt-spoonful of English and same of French mustard, a pinch of salt and white

just dropping in the oil carefully, drop by drop; when this is as thick as butter, 
add a teaspoonful of tarragon vinegar, four or five drops of chilli vinegar and 
eight drops of lemon-juice. The sauce should be kept quite stiff. 

MELTED-BUTTER SAUCE. 

First, the one sauce which we are supposed to make, and that not well! 
How often is it to be met with on the one hand like bill-stickers' paste, on the 
other, a slop which swims the plate and looks like thin gruel! And as this is 
the foimdation of so many sauces, sweet and savory, it is certainly worth while 
to Ivuow the correct way to make it. We are nothing if not practical, so it will 
not serve our purpose to enlighten our readers as to the method adopted when 
the richest melted butter is required; we may say that it is almost all butter, 
and those who can afford it will no doubt have cooks competent to produce it. 
Unquestionably, the surest way to avoid lumps is to first melt the butter in a 
small stew-pan, then add the flour very gradually, next the water or milk, 
also, little by little, stirring unceasingly until it boils, and for one minute after- 
ward, when it is ready to serve. As to quantities, the happy medium is hit, 
and a nice, smooth sauce the result, by using an ounce of butter and half an 
ounce of flour to each half pint of water or milk. When tlie latter is used, add 



SAUCES. 21 

the salt last; it is apt to curdle iicav milk if put in with it. When a richer sauce 
is desired, allow an extra ounce of butter, and reduce the water a little. INIany 
of the best cooks apitrove of the addition of a slice of butter stirred in after the 
sauce is taken from the fire; a spoonful of cream is another improvement. 
This, as most of our readers are presumably aware, forms the basis of an 
almost endless variety of sauces, such as parsley, egg, onion, and fish sauces 
innumerable. In some cases it is an improvement to use veal stock or gravy 
instead of water, and fish sauce— when the fish is filleted— should receive all 
the goodness and flavor of the bones, which need slow stewing in the water 
used for making tlie sauce. We want chiefly to impress the correct proportions 
of flour, butter and liquid upon our readers' minds; thej' can then alter, or 
deviate from, any recipes they may meet with.

MUSHROOM SAUCE. 



Prepare the mushrooms by cutting off the stalks, and throAV them into boil- 
ing water. Season very sparingly Avith salt, pepper and butter. Boil until 
tender, and thicken the gravy with a tablespoonful of flour and a piece of 
butter the size of a butter-beau, and pour it over the meat. Some use a little 
lejnou-juice to add to the flavor. 

MUSTARD SAUCE.

Cook until thick. When cold it is ready for use. 
M. L. Hann, Wellington, Kansas. 

OYSTER SAUCE. 

What a popidar dainty is a tureen of oyster sauce, and how often is it spoiled 
by the common practice of letting the oysters boil in it! The proper way is to 
strain the liquor, and boil that with the flour and butter, adding a dash of cay- 
enne, lemon-juice, nutmeg and anchovy essence, and the oysters the last thing, 
long enough for them to become hot through, removing the sauce from tlie fire 
so that it shall not boil after they are put in. Follow this plan either for canned 
or fresh oysters; when the last-named are used, the beards should be stewed in 



2^ SAUCES. 

the oyster liquor until their flavor is fully extracted. Many cooks recommend 
mace for almost all white sauces, but one fears to mention it, for it is a spice 
that is so overpowering in flavor that a trifle too much renders anything uneat- 
able. In the hands of a skilled cook it is certainly valuable, though nutmeg can, 
in almost evei-y case, be used as a substitute.

Chapter IV. 

The quantity of water iu making soup should be proportioued to tlie (luautity 
of meat used. Allow a quart of water to a pound of meat. In malting soup 
from fresh meat, always put it on to cook in cold water. To keep the quantity, 
fill up from water in tea-kettle, which should be boiling, so as not to stop your 
soup boiling. 

If you Avish a vegetable soup, coolc the vegetables separately, and add tliem 
to yoiu" SOU]) shortly before removal. 

If soup is desired frequently, stock for making it quickly can always be on 
hand. With your meat-cleaver, cut up all tlie bones left from your roasts and 
beel'steaks, and keep them in a covered stone jar. When you have sufficient, 
put them on and boil for three hours; strain this into an earthen vessel, and set 
aside to cool. A tliick top of grease Avill rise to the surface, which can be taken 
off and used for frying purposes. The meat-juice beneath, Avhich sometimes is 
a thick jelly, can be diluted if not Avanted strong. With the addition of some 
cooked vegetables, soup can readily be made from this. 

The grease should always be skimmed from all soups. Long and slow boiling 
is necessary to extract the strength from the meat. If boiled rapidly over a very 
hot fire, the meat becomes hard and tough, and Avill not give out its juices. The

SOUPS, 



cook f-honld season soup sliglilly, as more can be added if necessary, wliile it is 
impossible to remove it. 

For flavoring- soups, baj'-leaves, sweet marjoram, thyme, celery-tops aud 
parsley are used, as suits the taste. 

If a purely vegetable soup is desired, three or four vegetables combined is 
sufficient; namely, cabbage, potatoes, turnips and onions. If tomatoes are 
desired, use a little ouiou only. 

Never use rice, pearl barley or noodles iu the same soup. 

Pearl barley should be cooked by itself, and then added to the soup. 

Tlie best soup is made by cooking the stock the day previous, and adding the 
cooked vegetables to this, heated the second day. 

All soup should be Avell skimmed, as often there is a scum rising to the 
surface of all boiling meats. 

Never set away soups or gravies in a vessel of tin or copper; and it is best to 
use a wooden spoou. 

There are two kinds of soups— brown and white. To make the brown, use 
beef; the white, veal. 

To color soups, use scorched flour or burnt sugar. 

Though celery may be obtained at all times of the year, it may be Avell to 
know that celery-seed is an excellent substitute. 

Vermicelli and macaroni for soups can be bought of the grocer; also prepared 
bean and pea flour for tliickening soups. 

BEEF SOUP. 

Take five or six pounds of beef, and put it into a large kettle, with two 
gallons of cold water and one tablespoonful of salt. Put it to cooking soon after 
breakfast, and when it boils, slvim oft" nW the sciun that rises. Let it boil slowly 
until one hour before dinner, then add 

2 large onions, 1 root of celery, chopped fine, 

M> head of cabbage, 8 potatoes, quartered, 

2 carrots. Some parsley-leaves. 

When the vegetables are done, put a piece of butter in a skillet, with two 
tablespoonfuls of flour, aud stir it to a nice broAvn. Add this to the soup, aud 
season AA'ith pepper and salt. 

Mrs. R. Jaeger, Cleveland, Minnesota. 

BISQUE OF MUTTON. 

Wash, and cut into pieces one neck of mutton, put it into a kettle, with two

return the soup and rice to the kettle and bring to the boiling point; add a pint 
of milk or thin cream and a palatable seasoning of salt and pepper, and it is 
ready to serve. This makes one of the daintiest of luncheon soups, and is 
exceedingly benefi.cial for conA^alesciug patients.

CLAM SOUP. 

Open fifteen sfl'awbei-ry clams; put them into an enameled kettle, with one 
quart of boiling ^Aater; boil, removing all scum that rises. Stir one tablespoon- 
ful of corn-starch into a cupful of milk, with a little salt, pepper and a small 
piece of butter; pour on the clams, and let boil until done, as the starch requires 
cocking. Beat up one egg A^ith a little milk, and remove your kettle from the 
fire; stir in your beaten egg carefully, else it will be stringy; send to the table.

CLEAB SOUP. 
Take one quart of flavored stock, made either from bones or fresh meat, skim 
it, and pour AAithout sediment into a stew-pan; while it is cold, stir in one half 
pound of beef without either fat or sinew, and cut very small, one carrot scraped 
to pulp, one turn!]) and one leek cut into dice; keep stirring until the liquor is 
on the point of boiling, then draAV the stew-pan back, skim, and let simmer for 
twenty minutes; strain slowly through a .ielly-bag until clear. The soup will 
become cloudy if allowed to stand long liefore being used. If liked, it can be 
clarified with Avhite of egg, but white of egg impoverishes soup, while beef 
enriches it.

until the next day. Remove every particle of fat, and put it into a stew-pan 
(being careful to leave any sediment at the bottom); add one large carrot cut 
into slices, one turnip, one onion and one half dram of bruised celery-seed tied 
in muslin; let simmer for one and one half hours. If the liquid is very much 
reduced, add a little cold water, so as to keep up the quantity to three pints. 
Season it while boiling with pepper, salt and a small lump of sugar; strain 
again, and skim it carefully from time to time. In order to make it quite clear 
and bright, Avhisk the whites of tAvo eggs with one half pint of water, and stir 
briskly into the soup Avhen it is just warm; let it boil, and gently lift ofE the 
scum as it rises; draAv the stew-pan back a little, and keep boiling gently for one 
half hour; let it stand to settle, and strain through a jelly-bag tAA'o or three times 
if necessary. It requires the white of one egg to each pint of soup. Add one 
tea spoonful of extract of beef, and a little bi'OAvning if the color is too liglit, but 
care must be talcen in this. This soup may be A^aried to anj' extent; carrots, 
turnips, onions, celery, green peas, asparagus, A'ermicelli or macaroni may be 
added. Macaroni and vermicelli should be boiled separately, or they will spoil 
the clearness. Sufficient for three pints.

QUENELLES. 
Quenelles are small balls made of delicate French forcemeat, composed of 
panada, calf's udder and the flesh of veal, poultry or fish, thoroughly pounded, 
then seasoned and moistened with egg. They take their names from the meats 
of which they are composed. Great care and patience are required in making 
them, and these must be directed principally to pounding the ingredients thor- 
oughly, first separately and afterward togetlier. Quenelles are served either in 
soups or witli rich sauce, as a ragout, or they maj' be dipped in egg and bread- 
crumbs, fried in hot fat, and served as croquettes. Wlien the forcemeat is made, 
it is always best to test a little piece before poaching or frying the whole of the 
preparation. To do this, a small ball should be molded and thrown into fast- 
boiling water. If, when it is taken out, the quenelle is light, firm and well 
seasoned, no alteration is necessary; if it is too firm, a little water may be added, 
and if not firm enough, the yolk of an egg will, in all probability, make it of the 
proper consistency. 

QUENELLES FOR WHITE AND CLEAR SOUPS.

In selectins' a fish, see that the flesh is firm -when pressed by the finger, 
and the eyes full. If the fish is at all stale, the flesh Avill be flabby and the eyes 
sunken. 

To remove the earthy or muddy taste, soak in strong salt-water a short time 
before cooking. 

To clean fish, lay it on a board outdoors, take a dull knife, and holding the 
fish by the tail, with the knife held nearly flat, scrape toward the head, then 
thoroughly rinse, and wipe dry. Cut off the head and fins and remove the 
entrails. If there are any eggs, coolv them with the fish. 

Always coolv your fish the same day you buy. 

Fresh mackerel spoil quicker than almost any other. 

To freshen salt fish, lay it skin side up, and ahvays in an earthen vessel, 
never in tin. 

In frying fish, have your lard very hot; lay in the fish, and as soon as 
browned on one side, turn over; when that side is brown, move the skillet to the 
back of the stove, cover closely, and let it cook sloAvly. In this way it retains 
its sweetness. 

Garnishes for fish are sliced beets, parsley, lettuce-leaves and hard-boiled 
eggs. 

In shredding codfish, or otlier salt fish, use a small, three-tined steel fork. 

Yon must use plenty of lard in frying fish, never butter. 

If you have not a fish-kettle in Avhich to boil fish, it must be carefully tied 
up in thin swiss or cambric, to preserve the shape. 

Oysters are considered in season only from October 1st until the last of 

March.

tablespoonful of minced and fried onion, and if preferred, a little minced pars- 
ley; cook a trifle, and after removing from the fire, add a beaten egg. 

CHARTREUSE OF FISH A LA HAVEAISE. 
Chartreuse de Poisson cl la Havraise. 
Take the fillets of a sole, put them to press until cool, then cut them out with 
a plain, round cutter; ornament half of them with chopped tarragon, chervil or 
parsley, and the remaining half with trutfle, setting the garnish with a little 
liquid aspic jelly. Line a mold with aspic jelly, and arrange the rounds of sole 
all over it, as shown in the engraving; set this with aspic, then fill up the center 




with the mixture below; put the mold aside until this is set, then dip the mold 
into hot water, turn out the form onto a cold dish. Serve for a luncheon or 
second-course dish. The dish may be garnished with any nice. salad, such as 
lettuce or endive, mixed with a little salad-oil, tarragon, chilli vinegar and 
chopped tarragon. 

Mixture for Chartreuse of Fish a la Havraise. — Take one half pint of 
cleansed, picked shrimps, the trimmings from tlie sole cut into dice shapes, two 
peeled tomatoes, four cooked artichoke bottoms and twelve raw bearded sauce 
oysters, all similarly cut up; add a little tarragon and chervil, mix with one half 
pint of liquid aspic jelly and two large tablespoonfuls of mayonnaise sauce, 
stir all together on ice until beginning to set, then pour into the mold as 

directed. 

FRIED FISH. 

The proper method of frying fish is simply boiling in lard. French cooks 
never use butter in frying, as the color is not good, but give the preference to 
beef fat. The great secret of success is to have the fat the proper temperature 
before putting in the fish. Experienced cooks know just when the boiling-point 
is reached, but for those not so expert, a good test is to drop in a piece of dough 
or a bit of bread; if it browns in a minute, the fat is at the pi'oper heat.

fillets, put aside; take tlie trimmings (not the bones), pound well in a mortar, 
season with salt, pepper and nutmeg, put in one whole egg and one ounce of 
good, fresh butter. Boil one half cupful of fresh bread-crumbs in one half cup- 
ful of milk, stir with a wooden spoon for about five minutes over a hot fire, so 
as to make a solid paste; remove from the fire and let cool off. When cool 
enough, mix this paste with the forcemeat in your mortar, and when well 
mixed, put through a fine sieve. IMask or cover one side of the cutlets with a 
thin layer of this forcemeat; take what is left over and roll it on a table on 
Avhich you have sprinkled a little flour. Try to make a ring large enough to 
fit in the dish on which you intend to serve your fish. If the dish is oval, make 
the ring oval. Butter a piece of paper, and lay the ring on it, put the whole 
on a flat pan. flatten the ring all around the top. so as to be able to set the 
fillets on. This ring is called bordure. Cover with another well-buttered paper 
and put away in a cool place. (There are special bordure-molds. and if you 
should have one, put your forcemeat into it, after having well buttered all 
around and on the bottom.) But the bones of your bass into a saucepan, season 



OYSTERS AND FISH. 59 

Willi salt, ix'ppor, one bny-lcaf, a little thyme, one half of au onion, two slices 
of carrot, a little parsley, our half of a glassful of dry white wine, two glassfuls 
of cold water. Let this boil slowly for twenty-live minutes. Put twa-ounces of 
butler and one tablespoonful of flour into a small saucepan, and cook for ten 
minutes, stirring continually with a wooden spoon; add your fish broth after 
liaving strained it, let this sauce cook for twenty minutes, and skim it well. 
This sauce must be very smooth. Keep hot without letting boil. Have one half 
of a pound of shelled shrimps, and put into a saucepan of cold water, and as 
soon as the latter boil.s, take off tlu> tire, and cool the shrimps off by letting cold 
water run over them. When thoroughly cooled off, strain, cut each shrimp into 
two or three equal pieces, according to their size, put them into the sauce. Take 
the coral of a boiled lobster, chop very line, sprinkle some of it over your fillets 
which have been covered with a layer of forcemeat, so as to 'give a nice red 
color. Put these fillets into a Hat saucepan, called sauteuse; after having 
buttered the bottom of it well, add four tablespooufuls of your fish broth, if 
you have any left; if not, one half a glassful of white wine mixed with a little 
water will do; cover with well-buttered paper. I*ound the rest of your coral 
with one ounce of good butter, pass througli a line sieve; add this to your sauce, 
with one tablesjjoonful of good sherry and one tablespoonful of wliipped cream, 
so as to make the sauce as light as possible; tliis sauce should have a pretty 
pink color. Twenty minutes before serving, cook your bordure in a mild oven; 
ten to fifteen minutes will do; touch tlie top, and if the forcemeat resists, the 
bordure Is cooked; keep it warm. Ten minutes before sending the soup to the 
table, put your fillets over the fire, and let them simmer about ten or fifteen 
minutes. Let the bordure slide on your dish, being careful not to break it; put 
your fillets on it, all around the top, wreath-like, and put the sauce in the center 
without putting any on the fillets; serve very hot. Th(> fillets of bass a la 
cardinale is one of the ricliest fish dishes gotten up, and has two qualities, 
which are to please the eye and palate at the same time.

pass one by one through the tlour. then through the egg mixture, then the 
cracker-dust; return it again to the egg mixture, and pass tlu-ough the bread- 
crumbs, pressing the oysters lightly. If convenient, do not fry the oysters at 
once, but let them remain for an hour or so; then fry tliem in clear, hot lard 
until straw yellow. This will appear a little complicated to a private house 
cook, but one trial will convince the cook that it is time and patience well

before serving, with a little S!ih)d-oil. The above can be used as a savory, in 
which case a flat oi- entree dish would be used. If serving as hors-d'oeuvres, a 
single plate can, if convenient, be placed before each guest; or several can be 
placed at intervals about the table, or they may be handed with spoon and fork, 
to allow the guests to help themselves. 

BROILED OYSTERS. 

Drain select oysters in a colander; dip them, one by one, into melted butter

when nicely browned on both sides, season with salt and pepper and plenty of 
butter, and lay them on hot, buttered toast; wet with a little hot milk, and serve 
very hot or they will not be nice. Oysters cooked in this way and served on 
broiled beefsteak are nice, 




Chapter VI. 



Chiokons, turkoys, geese and ducks are better killed the day before usinj?, and 
during the winter two or three days' keeping will be no injury. Also avoid 
feeding them for twenty-four hours before killing. 

The best way is to tie the feet together, hang from a horizontal pole, tie the 
wings together ovc^r the back with a strip of soft cotton cloth, let them hang 
five minutes, then make an incision in the throat or cut off the head, and allow 
tliem to hang until the blood has ceased to drip. Chicliens only should be 
scalded; other fowls and game should be picked dry until all the feathers are 
removed except tlie very soft down, tlieh pour on liot water; this will swell the 
fowl, and the down can be easily rubl)ed off with the palm of the hand. Wipe 
dry, and singe over burning paper to remove the hair. 

If it is an old fowl, feed a leaspoouful of vinegar half an hour before killing, 
which is said to make it tender. Also, in boiling a fowl, a very little soda or a 
tablespoonful of vinegar added to tlie water will make it quite tender. 

To cut up a cliicken, lay upon a board, cut off tlie feet at the first joint, cut 
a slit in the neck, take out the \\innpii)e and crop, cur off the wings and legs at 
the joints which unite them to tlie body, separate tlie first joint of the leg from 
t)u; second, cut off the oil-bag. make a slit horizontally under the tail, cut the 
end of the entrails loose, extend the slit on eacli side of the joint where the legs 
were cut off; then with the left hand hold the breast of the chicken, and with 
the right bend back the rump until the joint in the back separates, cut it clear, 
and place in water; take out the entrails, using a sharp knife to separate the

e^'gs and all otlier particles to be removed from the back, being careful in 
ri-iDoving- the heart and liver not to break the gall-bag (a small sack of blue- 
green color, about an incli long, attached to the liver), separate the back and 
bieast; commence at the high point of the breast and ..cut downward towai'd 
the head, taking off the breast Avith the wishbone; cut the neck from that part 
of the back to Avhich the ribs are attached, turn the skin off the neck, and take 
out all lumps and stringy substances; A^ery carefully remove the gall-bag from 
the liver, and clean the gizzard by making an incision through the thick part 
and lirst lining, peeling off the flesliy pai't, leaving the inside whole and ball- 
shaped; if the lining breaks, open the gizzard, pour out the contents, peel off 
the innei- lining and wash thoroughly. After washing in the second water the 
chicken Is ready to be cooked. 

When young chickens are to be baked, w^ith a sharp knife cut open the back 
ar the side of the backbone, press apart, and clean as above directed, and place 
in a dripping-pan, skin side up. 

Keeping a panful of water in the oven will keep fowls from scorching. 

Wild game should be fried in butter before boiling, as it improves the flavor. 

If the fishy taste in wild game is objectionable, 
it can be removed by putting a small onion, cut 
fine, into the Avater in Avhich it is cooked, or 
carrots, if onions are not liked. Poultky-knifb. 

Game can be kept two days in Avarm Aveather 
by cleaning thoroughly, rubbing the insides and necks with pepper, plac^ing 
inside several pieces of charcoal, covering Avith a cloth, and hanging in a dark, 
cool place. 

If, from the odor, you feel they are at all stale, soaldng a fcAv hours in char- 
coal-water or soda-water Avill SAveeten your game Avhen apparently spoiled. 

There is nothing so repulsive as underdone game or poultry. Be sure it is 
well done in cooking. 

To select poultry, try if the Aving Avill spring easily, or the breast-bone bend 
readily under the pressure of the thumb. The skin that attaches the wing to 
the body should break. 

A steamer for cooking turkeys can be improvised by placing some pieces of 
kindling in the bottom of a Avash-boiler; upon these place the turkey; put in 
only enough hot Avater to cover the kinc^ling, put on the boiler-lid, and set over 
the fire. If the Avater boils aAvay, replenish with hot w^ater. Keep closely cov- 
ered, to prevent the escape of steam. One hour Avill be snflocient time to steam it 
before baking. 

The breasts of many of our wild game birds. A\'hen properly taken off, make 
beautiful ornaments, and are useful in trimming hats, muffs, etc. To properly 
remove them, it is necessary to skin the birds. To do this, Avith a sharp knife 
cut the skin on the back from the neck to the tail in a straight line; then skin- 
each side by cutting the connecting tissue. When removed, rub with water in 
which salt and saltpeter have been dissolved in the proportion of one part of 
saltpeter to four of salt, and tack up on the side of the house or barn, where the 
S1U1 can dry the skin thoroughly. 

Garnish means to add a trimming to meat, poultry or salads. In dishing up 
roast meat, lay a spoonful of jelly of gooseberries just on the slice to be served

off its head, and open it at the baclv of the neck and remove the backbone and 
breast-bone as far as the leg-joint, removing the entrails with the carcass; then 
stulf it, sew it up, and truss it for boiling. The feet should be just dipped into 
boiling water, and then the outer skin remoA'cd, the sinews cut off, and the toes 
cut short, and the lower part of the leg with the foot replaced; tie the turkey 
up in a well-buttered cloth, and put it to boil for one and one half to two hours, 
according to the size of the bird, in good stock, with vegetables, such as carrot, 
onion, celery and herbs (basil, marjoram, bay-leaf, thyme and parsley), a few 
black and white peppercorns, six or eight cloves and a blade or two of mace; 
let the stock come to a boil, then draw the pan to the side of the oven and let 
it simmer gently until cooked. Take up the turkey, remove the cloth, and let 
it get cold; it is best to boil the turkey the day before it is to be dished up. When 
cold, remove the strings, and mask the bird over with white chaudfroid sauce, 




putting on tvro or three coatings of the sauce until it is well masked; when the 
sauce is somewhat set, lightly mask that over with aspic jelly which is not quite 
set, so as to give the surface a polish, and at once sprinkle over it some finely 
shredded blanched pistachio-nuts; when the aspic is set, dish up the turkey and 
garnish it around Avith ornamentally cut pieces of aspic; talce three hatelet 
skewers, and on tliem place some of the prepared crayfish or cooked prawns 
and truffle or financiere garnish and pate de foie gras, and arrange them on the

in a strong cloth, so as to keep the shape as nice as possible; put into a stew-pan 
two or three sliced onions, a few slices of carrot, turnip, celery, fresh mush- 
room, a good bunch of herbs, one pint of coolclng white wine, the juice of two 
lemons, one teaspoonful of black and white peppercorns, six or eight cloves,

WILD DUCKS. 

Nearly all wild clucks are liable to have a fishy flavor, and when handled 
by inexperienced cooivs, are sometimes uneatable from this cause. Before roast- 
ing them, guard against this by parboiling tiiem with a small peeled carrot put 
within each. This will absorb the unpleasant taste. An onion will have the 
same effect; but unless you mean to use onion in the stuffing, the carrot is 
pieferable. In my own kitchen, I usually put in the onion, considering a 
suspicion of garlic .a desideratum in roast duck, whether wild or tame. 

ROAST WILD DUCK. 

Parboil according to directions for preparing wild duck; throw away the 
carrot or onion, lay in fresh water half an hour; stuff with bread-crumbs 
seasoned with pepper, salt, sage and onion, and roast until brown and tender, 
basting for half the time with butter and water, then Avith the drippings; add 
to the gravy, when you have taken up the ducks, a teaspoonful of currant jelly 
and a pinch of cayenne; thicken with browned fiour, and serve in a tureen. 

ROAST GOOSE. 

Dress the fowl twenty-four hours before using, and soak in salt-water two 
hours before cooking; make a maslied-potato dressing, seasoned with onion, 
butter, pepper and salt; fill the body of the goose, grease it all over well with 
butter, and dredge with flour; place in a pan, with a pint of water; baste well, 
and cook two hours; serve with onion graA^y and apple sauce. 

BOILED GOOSE. 

Soak over night in SAveet millv; in the morning, wash, and allow it to stand 
in cold water one hour; fill the body AA'ith Avell-seasoned bread-dressing, using 
salt, pepper, onions and sage. Tie up in a tliin cheese-cloth; boil two hours; 
serve AAnth giblet sauce and gooseberry jam. 

PIGEON PIE. 

Clean and truss three or four pigeons, rub the outsides and insides with a 
mixture of pepper and salt; rub the insides with a bit of butter, and fill them 
with a bread-and-butter stuffing or mashed potatoes; sew up the slit, butter the 
sides of a tin basin or pudding-dish, and line (the sides only) Avith pie paste rolled 
to one fourth of an inch in thickness; lay the birds in; for three large tame 
pigeons, cut one fourth of a pound of sweet butter, and put it over them; strew 
over a large teaspoonful of salt and a small teaspoonful of pepper, with a bunch 
of finely cut parsley, if liked; dredge one large tablespoonful of wheat flour over, 
put in water to nearly fill the pie; lay skewers across the top, "cover with a puff- 
paste crust; cut a slit in the middle, ornament the edge with leaves, braids or 
shells of paste, and put it in a moderately hot or quick oven for one hour; when 
nearly done, brush the top over Avith the yolk of an egg beaten with a little milk, 
and finish. The pigeons for this pie may be cut in two or more pieces, if 
preferred. Any small birds may be done in this manner.

an ineh thic-lc, pressing it well into the shniie of the molds, trim off the edges 
neatly, and line the insides with l)uttered papei-; till the papers with raw rice, 
and balce in a moderate oven for about forty minutes; when done, remove the 
riee and the paper from the paste-cases, and put tlie latter back into the oven to 
dry, and when ready to use, brush over the outsides very lightly Avith raw white 
of egg that has been mixed with a fork, using as little as possible; then sprinkle 
the cases with finely chopped parsley, fill them Avith a ragout of game, and 
arrange on the top of the ragout by means of a forcing-bag and rose-pipe a little 
liver farce, then place around the edges of the croustades little rings made from 
tlu^ short paste and masked in the same way as the cases; place the cases upon a 
hot dish on a dish-paper, and serve. Use as an entree for dinner or luncheon. 




IvAGoiTT FOR Croustades a la Bristol.— Take about one half pound of any 
remains of cold cooked game or poultry, remove the bones and skin, and cut 
the meat into dice; mix it with two or three cooked button mushrooms, and then 
mix thess into reduced salmis sauce; make hot in thf bain-marie, and use. 



COLD GAME PIE A LA CLEVELAND. 

Take one pound of raw veal, put into two parts; cut one part of it into small 
slices about three inches long and one half inch thick. TalvC a pound of fresh loin 
of pork, proceed tlie same as you did before; cut half of it into thin slices; put 
both veal and pork which you cut up into a bowl. Take a thin slice of cooked 
ham, cut into fixe or six equal parts lengthwise. Take one partridge, bone it, 
and take all the nerves out of it; put liam and partridge into the bowl with the 
rest. Cook one half glassful of dry Avhite wine in a small saucepan, with a 
chopped shallot, one bay-leaf, a littl(< tiiyme, a few slices of onion, one half 
handful of whole black pepper. After having let this boil for a few minutes, 
strain through a sieve on your meats in the bowl, put a little salt over it. Take 
half a pound of fat lardjng-pork, take off the skin, add to the other half of your 
veal and pork, pass twice through a cliopping-inachine. This will make the 
forcemeat to put into your pie.

I'ASTE FOR Pie.— Soak one pound of tloiiv Avilh oue fourth poiTud of buttei'. 
OHO and one half glassfuls of cold water; mix everything well. This paste must 
be hard, but not stringy; let it rest for two hours. 

The mold used for this pie is oval,- and opens on the sides with hinges; it 
has no bottom. Put this mold on a roast or pastry pan which you have well 
buttered. Have a piece of paste to fit in your mold about one fourth of an inch 
thiclv; that means to have the bottom and the sides all garnished with the paste; 
fill the bottom with a thin layer of forcemeat you have ready; cut four truffles 
into tliielv slices; put your partridge meat on top of those; cover all this again 
with forcemeat, and continue putting your veal, pork and forcemeat in until 
the mold is filled; over all this put a few large slices of larding-pork, to prevent 
the pie from drying up; put again over the latter a thin cover of paste. To make 
this cover stick to the rim of the other paste, which must surpass the mold a 
little, you must wet the edge of the cover. Slake a sort of bordure around the 
pie, and decorate the top Avith a few leaves, which you cut out of paste; make 
a hole in the center of the pie, and put a kind of chimney made of thick paper 
in that hole; when you see the juice boil out of that chimney, the pie is cooked. 
A six-pound pie takes two and one half hours to cook; to prevent burning, 
put a few sheets of paper, which you have soaked in "butter, all around on top 
of the pie before putting it into the oven; when cooked, take out of the oven and 
let it cool off; when cold, fill the hole in the center with good melted meat 
jelly. These pies are choice cold dishes. They can be made with every kind of 
game, such as grouse, ducks, etc. They are generally served after entrees, 
always before the roast; are equal to foie gras, and are served with great 
advantage at receptions, dinners and suppers. 

Paul Resal, Chef of White House (Executive Mansion), Washiugton, D. C. 

FOIE GRAS A LA CHATEAU DOEE. 
Take an opened tin of foie gras, and stand it in the bain-marie until the 
contents are quite hot; then, when ready to serve, turn it out onto a plate, and 




cut it into portions, and dish it up. as in engraving, on a border of chicken or 
rabbit farce, -oith a small round of fried bread in the center; garnish the foie 
gras with financiere that has been warmed in the bain-marie, and with hatelet 
skewers; pour good espagnol sauce around the dish, then place some cooked 
button mushrooms at each end of the dish, and serve hot as an entree for a 
dinner party.

Chai'tek VII. 



Meat, when nst-d lor soup, should be put ou to cook in eohl water; also any 
salted meat, like ham or corned beef; but A\lKre it is intended to be used as 
boiled meat, it should be put on in boilinjj;-hot water, so as to harden the fibrine 
and confine the juices of the meat. The meat should in all cases be kept under 
the water. Turn it frequently, so it may cook on all sides. It should boil only 
gently. A pod of red pepper added to the pot will keep the odor of boiling from 
tilling the house. Remove all scum as it rises; allow twenty minutes to a pound. 

In roasting meat in ihe oven, it should be frequently basted; this is done l)y 
dipping tlie water or juices in the roasting-pan o\er the m(<at with a large spoon. 

The fire should not be allowed to get low befoi-e replenishing, as it checks the 
heat; try to keep the tire at a steady Ik at. 

In broiling meat, the gridiron should be very hot before putting on the meat; 
as soon as it sears or scorches, turn over. 

Do not salt your meat until nearly done, as it extracts the juices. 

To thaw out frozen meats, lay them in cold water, which should be done only 
shortly before using. 

After slicing from a ham. rub the cut side with corn-meal, as this prevents the 
liam from becoming rancid, and rubs off easily when needed again. 

In cooking tough meat or an old fowl, add a pinch of soda to the water to 
make it tender. 

If you have not tripods to lay in your roasting-pan to keep the meat up out 
of the juices, lay across the pan some clean pieces of wood. 

Veal, mutton and pork will keep perfectly fresh and good for weeks without 
salt or ice, in warm weather, by keeping it submerged in sour milk, changing 
the milk when mold appears; rin.se in cold water when wanted for use. 



112 MEATS. 

For "curing hams, trim nice aild smooth when thoroughly cold after killing; 
pacli in salt and let them remain for Hyb or six weeks, then take them up and 
dip them into boiling brine; then rub the flesh side with pulverized black pepper 
as long as it will stick; hang in a dry place. 

To keep hams that have been smoked, rub the flesh part with molasses, then 
sprinkle Avith as much black pepper as will stick to the molasses; hang them up 
and keep dry'. 

To prevent meats from scorching, keep a panful of water sitting in the oven; 
the steam arising also tends to make the meat tender. 

Always save all drippings from roasted or fried meats to use for frying 
potatoes; also allow the water from boiling meat to stand until the next day, 
and remove the fat from tlie top to your dripping-jar; never allow any burned 
grease of any kind to be put into this jar. 

In broiling meat over coals, never allow them to smoke the least; after the 
cofils have burnt dov/n somewhat, throw on a handful of salt to deaden the 
blue flame that arises. If the dripping from your meat takes fire, remove from 
the stove to cool for a few. moments; don't try to blow it out, as there is danger 
of burning the face. 

Have a tin cover made at your tinner's to fit into your dripping-pan to cover 
over your meats and poultry while cooking, as they are so much nicer cooked 
in this way. It should be higii, and just the shape of the pan it is to cover. 

Nice lard can be made from leaf-lard, and many housekeepers prefer it; 
procure it at the butcher's, and fry it out yourself; a teacupful of water added 
will keep it from burning. 

To preserve sausages, cut and roll them in small, thin cakes, and fry them 
until well done; paciv closely in jars, and cover with melted lard one inch thick; 
set away iu a cool place, and you will have nice, sweet sausage all spring and 
summer. 

To sweeten salt pork, cut as many slices as you Avill require for breakfast, 
and soak till morning in sweet milk and water, then rinse until the water is 
clear, and fry. 

A beefsteak can be well cooked in hot suet, and after taking out the steak, 
stir a spoonful of flour in the pan, pour in hot water and let it boil, and you have 
a nice gravy. 

Hub flour and butter together, and brown iu a skillet ; then put the meat gravy 
Avltli it, and you have a nice gravy. 

TENDERLOIN OF BEEF (AVEST HOTEL STYLE). , 

Cut out of a good tenderloin of beef six steaks one inch thick, and season 
with pepper and salt; broil them on a good charcoal fire for six minutes (three 
minutes on each side). Broil six large, fresh mushrooms, seasoned with salt, 
pepper, ground thyme and ground sage. Cut out of three large tomatoes six 
slices as thick as possible, fry them in butter. Make a good bearnaise sauce; put 
the bearnaise sauce on a hot platter, put the fried tomatoes on top of the sauce, 
and the tenderloin on top of the tomatoes, then the mushrooms on top of the 
tenderloin; pour over the mushrooms a good brown gravy; finish with a glassful 
of champagne, and add a tablespoonful of chopped parsley.

FILLET OF BEEF A LA GODAED (ORNAMENTAL). 

This remove is one of tlie most elegant whieli can be served at a sumptuous 
dinner or can be presented to tlie guest. Two good, small fillets of beef, but not 
too fat, are neatly trimmed, larded and braised in a good stoclt. When done, 
glazed and of a nice color, they are carved into slices; that is to say, this carving- 
stops some distance from tlie extremities and penetrates no further than three 
parts of the meat. The carved pieces are put back in their places. These fillets 
are dished up on a fond of cooked rice, cut into long shape, and on an inclined 
plane on both sides. Between the two fillets are dished three quenelles, with 
pieces of truffles large enough to 'fill the empty space under these quenelles. At 
the bottom of the dish is arranged a beautifid ring of slices of sweetbreads, 
partly crumbed Avith bread and partly with truffles; they are done in clarified 
butler. Between the quenelles and the chain formed by the sweetbreads are 
distributed groups of mushrooms. At both ends of the dish some fine whole 
truffles surround tlie top of the fillets; this garnish is similarly repeated on the 
other side of the dish. Between the two fillets, and in the center of the dish, 
a pretty garnish-cup is fixed on the foundation. I'his cup may be of metal, 
masked with English or Nouilles paste, and ornamented; it may also be made 
\A-ith bread, or even cut out of large turnips, wliich in the north of Europe 
become very large, white, and with little skill some elegant cups can be made 
out of these turnips, to use with so rich and elegant a remove. A good, light 
espagnole sauce must be served; that is, not too thick, but juicy, beaten well and 
thinned with good stock and some Madeira, as well as with the liquor of the 
truffles. This same is sent up separately.

slices; bat these out with a wet choppiug-knife, season them with a little pepper 
and salt, and place a thin slice of fat bacon (cut to the same shape as the 
fillets) on each; thinly mask this bacon with beef farce, using a forcing-bag 
and plain pipe for it, and on the farce place a thin slice or two of button mush- 
rooms or truffles, and roll up the fillets in cylinder shapes, with farce, etc., 
inside; place in little bands of buttered paper, and tie them up with thin string 
to keep them in proper form. Put about one ounce of butter into a stew-pan, 




with two or three slices of carrot and turnip, a little celery, a bunch of herbs 
(thyme, parsley and baj-leaf), one or two sliced onions and six or eight pepper- 
corns; place the fillets on the vegetables, and fry all together for about fifteen 
minutes with the lid on tlie pan. then add one fourth of a pint of good stock, 
and put the pan into the oven; braise the fillets for one hour, occasionally basting 
them while cooking, then take up and remove the papers, brush the fillets over 
with a little warm glaze, and place them on a baking-tin in the oven for another 
fom- or five minutes to get crisp; dish up as in engraving, and garnish with slices 
of (rooked tomatoes (see recipe) around the top and between the fillets at the 
bottom; place peas in the center, and pour espagnol sauce around the base. 

CORNED OR SMOKED BEEF TONGUE. 

Soak the tongue twenty-four hours before boiling, which requires from three 
to four hours, according to size. The skin should always be removed as soon as 
it is taken from the pot. An economical method is to lay the .tongue, as soon as 
the skin is removed, in a jar, coiled up, with the tip outside the root, and a 
weight upon it. When it is cold, loosen the sides with a knife, and turn it out. 
The slices being cut horizontally all around, the fat and lean will go together.

This is a rich and luxurious remove— rich in its simplicity, luxurious in its 
bold preparations and fine form. For such a remove it is necessary to select 
one of those good, fat, young, tender sheep, the juicy and succulent flesh of 
Avhlch is so agreeable to the taste and so light on the stomach. Before being 
cooked, the piece must be neatly trussed, for if not, the cooking will put it out 
of shape; both legs must be run through with an iron skewer, then wrapped 
around, as well as the saddle, with thick paper; it must be roasted on the spit 
or baked in the oven, according to its weight and the thickness of its flesh, a 
consideration which should not be lost sight of; from one to one and one half 
hours will be required for the cooking. "When the piece is placed on the dish, 
a ruflfle is put on each leg-bone, and the surfaces are glazed with a paste-brush. 
Some rich gravy is sent up separately, also a garnish of varied or plain veg- 
etables, but always accompanied by potatoes. Such a piece must be carved in 
the dining-room; the meat is served on hot plates, with the light gravy running 
from it on the bottom of the dish.

Cut the slices thin tlien pound lilce beefsteali; eook on a griddle over hot coals 
(it need not be cooked much); save the .uravy, and butter the meat wlien done. 
Mrs. Thomas Trundle, Adamstown, Maryland. 

BAKED HAM. 

Most persons boil ham. It is mucli better baked, if baked right. Soal^ it for 
an hour in clean water, and wipe it dry. Next spread it all over with thin batter, 
and then put it into a deep dish, with sticks under it to keep it out of the gravy. 
"When it is luUy done, lake off the skin and batter crusted upon the flesh side, 
and set away to cool. It should bake fro)n six to eight hours. After removing 
the skin, sprinkle over with two tablespoonfuls of sugar, some black pepper and 
powdered crackers. Put into a pan, and return to the oven to brown; then take 
up and stick cloves through the fat, and dust w'ith pow'dered cinnamon. 

HAM-AND-EGG LUNCH LOAF.

crackers and from three to six eggs, according to the amount of your meat. Bake 
in a round baking-powder box or empty spice-box, and when cold, it can be sliced 
for the table.

bread-crumbs, wet with milk. Put the batter into gem-pans, break one egg over 
each, sprinkle tlie top thickly with cracker-crumbs, and bake until browned over. 
A nice breakfast dish. 

BOILED HAM, 

Pour boiling water over it, and when cool enough, scrape and w^ash clean. Put 
into a boiler, and cover it with cold water; bring to the boiling-point, then place 
on the back of the stove to boil gently for three or four hours, or until tender, so 
as to stick a fork into it. Turn the ham once or twice in the w^ater. When done, 
take up and put into a baking-pan to skin. Dip the hands in cold water; take 
the skin between the fingers, and peel as you would an orange. Set in a mod- 
erate oven, and bake one hour, as this draws out the superfluous fat. leaving the 
meat more delicate, and in \v;irm weather it Avill keep in a cool place a long 
time. Any tendency to mold may be removed by setting it in the oven awhile. 
To glaze a boiled ham, sprinkle with sugar and pass a hot knife over it, or brush 
it over with the Avell-beaten yolk of an egg, sprinkle w^ell with grated crackers 
or lircad-crumbs, and cover it with sweet cream; then put it into the oven to 
broAvu. The nicest portion of a boiled ham serve in slices, and the I'agged parts, 
odds and ends, are chopped fine for sandwiclies. or by adding three eggs to one 
l^int of chopped ham a delicious omelet may be made. 



HAM MOUSSE A LA L. P. MORTON. 

Pound one half pound of very lean ham in a mortar for about a quarter of 
an hour. When thoroughly pounded, remove from the mortar and put aside. 
Take the nerves out of the breast part of a young roasting chicken, pound the 
same as the ham, and mix them both; add the whites of two eggs, two table- 
spoonfuls of thick cream, one tablespoonful of sherry, a wee bit of cayenne 
pepper, a little grated nutmeg; mix this well in the mortar. (This is called force- 
meat). Pass through a very fine sieve, put into a bowl on ice to let it rest, so as 
to get it very firm. Cut four medium-sized truffles into small dice, mix them 
AA'ith the forcemeat, add also to it one pint of the best cream (Avhipped into 
froth). When you add the cream, proceed slowly, and mix with a wooden spoon. 
Butter Avell the bottom and sides of a plain mold, called charlotte-mold, till it 
with forcemeat, and keep on ice. One hour before serving, put this mold into a 
saucepan half full of boiling water, and put a cover on it (be careful not to let 
the water go over your mold); put this on the edge of the stove, but be careful 
not to let the water boil. You will be able to tell if your mousse is cooked by 
pressing lightly with your hand fiat on the top. If you feel the mousse resists 
the pressure, it is done. When ready to unmold, take a sharp knife, and cut a 
very thin slice ofC the top, which, of course, will be the bottom, once unmolded. 
This will make your mousse stand even on the dish. Serve a sauce supreme 
separate. 

Sauce Supreme.— Take the legs and bones of the chicken from which you 
have already cut the breast, put into a saucepan, with one small carrot, one small 
onion, one bay-leaf, two whole black peppers, one cloA^e, a little thyme, a little 
celery, a little parsley, four glassfuls of cold water and a teaspoonful of salt. 
Put two ounces of good butter into a saucepan, one tablespoonful of flour; let 
this cook together for ten minutes, stirring all tlie time, on the edge of the stove, 
without letting it get brown. Strain your broth into it, and let it cook for about 
tvt'enty minutes; slvim it well and take off the fire, but keep it warm. When 
ready to serve., add to it one half glassfvd of good double cream, but before 
addmg the latter, let the sauce boil, and add the cream gradually, stirring the 
sauce with a wooden spoon continually. Also add one teaspoonful of good sherry 
and two chopped truffles. Serve very hot. According to the taste and practice 
of the person who makes it, the mousse can be decorated with truffles. As you 
will have seen in this recipe, there is no salt mentioned in the preparation of the 
ham mousse, the ham itself being salty enough. 

N. B.— The mousse is a delicate and light dish, agreeable to the taste and easy 
to digest, and the most esteemed by the best epicures. 

Paul Resal, Chef of White House (Executive Mansion), Washington, D. C. 

TO BOIL BACON-HAM. 

After cleaning the ham well, place it in a large boiler, and fill It with cold 
water. Let it boil slowly five or six hours, then take it out and put it into a dish 
to drain. While it is still hot, or when it is cool, remove the skin and place it 
into the oven to brown. Mix one teacupful of vinegar, one tablespoonful of black 
pepjier, a little ground mustard, two or three tablespoonfuls of sugar, and baste 
the ham with it while it is roasting.

Julia A. P., Georgetown, New Jersey. 

HEADCHEESE. 
Take the heads, tongues and feet of young, fresh pork, or anj^ other pieces 
that are convenient. Having removed the skin, boil them until all the meat is 
quite tender, and can be easily stripped from the bones; then chop it very fine, 
and season it with salt and pepper, and ground cloves, if you choose, or sage- 
leaves rubbed to a powder; juix it all Avell with your hand; put it into deep 
l»ans witli straight sides, and press it down hard aud firm with a plate that will 
fit^lhe pan, putting the under side of the plate next to the meat, and placing a 
heavy weight on it. In two or tliree days turn it out of the pan, and cut it into 
thin slices. Use mustard aud vinegar over it. This is desirable for a supper or 
brealvfast dish. 

SALMAGUNDI. 

A salmagundi is a sort of vegetable mosaic made with pickled herring, cold 
dressed chicken, salt beef, radishes, olives, etc., all arranged with regard to con- 
trast in color, as well as fiavor, and served witli oil, vinegar, pepper and salt. 
The following is a good recipe for a salmagundi: 

Take cold fowl or turkey or veal, or all together; chop the meat very small, 
separating tlie white from the broAvn, and putting among the latter the brown 
part of the veal, if it is roasted. By the brown meat is understood the legs and 
backs of the poultry. Chop likewise the lean of some cold ham, a few boned 
and washed anchovies, a handful of picked parsley, half a dozen shallots, some 
piclvled gherliins, the yolks and whites, separate, of six hard-boiled eggs, and 
some roasted beet-root after it has become cold. Now butter a basin, and place 
it with the bottom upward upon a dish. Lay around this basin a ring of 



MEAtS. 



141 



chopped white moat oue and oue half inches wide and about one iucli high; then 
lay upon this 

1 ring of ham, then 1 of meat, 

1 ring of brown meat, 1 of the yolk of an egg, 

1 of tlie white of an egg, 1 of parsley, 

1 of anchovies. 

Keep on until the whole of the materials are consumed and the basin is 
covered, crowning the whole with a root of beet-root, garnislied witli a few 
pickled mushrooms. The sauce must be served in a sauce-tureen. It is thus 
made: Itub up a couple of good teaspooufuls of strong mustard from the 
mustard-pot. with three tables])ooufuls of salad-oil. some salt and a little 
cayenne pepper. When it has become a stiff paste, add. gradually, 

1 tablespoonful of white-Avine vinegar, 3 or 4 lemons, the juice of, 

1 dessert-spoonful of mushroom catchup, 2 tablespoonfuls of raw capers, 
1 tablespoonful of soy. 

Should the sauce not be sufficiently tliin, add more lemon-juice or vinegar.

'"■J'omatoes for Garnishing"); place a raw bearded oyster in the center of the 
kidney; cover this by means of a bag and plain pipe with a puree of mushrooms, 
sprinkle a few drops of glaze over, and serve for a breakfast or luncheon dish, 
or as an entree for dinner, using while quite hot.

ready to serve, make a small (juantity of batter, di]) each i)iece into it, and fry 
for five minutes in lard or fat; dish up with fried parsley over." 

FRIED SALSIFY, OK SALSIFY FKITTEKS. 

P.oil the salsify until tender, or, if preferred, take the remains of dressed 
salsify. Drain and dry the roots by pressin.i;- them in a soft cloth. Make a 
littl(> fryiiifi-batter, dip each root separately into this, throw them into hot fat, 
and fry thc;n until they are lijihtly bi'owiie<l. Take them np, drain tlwrn on a 
sieve, and serve very hot, piled hij,'h on a dish and {garnished with fried parsley. 
No sauce will be needed for them when dressed in this way. Sometimes the; 
salsify is dipped into esj? and bread-crumbs, instead of batter, before fryinj;. 
\\'hen batter is used, it may be made as follows: Put three tablespoonfuls of 
fiour into a bowl, Avitli one salt-spoonful of salt and one oinice of fresh butter; 
add as much lukewarm water as will melt the butter, and beat the whole to a 
su'.ooth batter. Put it into a cold i)lace, and ten minutes before it is wauled 
add the Avell-whisked white of an ejAjr. The salsify is occasiomilly soaked in 
vinesar, with a little peppe-r and .salt, before it is fried, but this is not neces- 
sary. When it has been done, the roots should be thorouf^hly drained afterward.

Chapter IX. 



Good broad makes the plainest fare npi)etizin.!:>", Avliile the most luxurious table 
lacks somethin;;- without it. (ireat care aud attention must be taken with bread, 
from the time the sponge is set until it is safely out of the oven. For it must not 
be allowed to rise too lons", and when all ready for the oven in beautiful loaves, 
it may be spoiled by being poorly baked. The sponge is the first process, and in 
different ways of making bread must be of different consistency; also, whether 
it is new or old Avlieat. But one must be an accomplished, cook to be able to 
detect all these contingencies. 

However, in all localities there are good brands of flour to ho had. and it is 
<vell to stick to the one witii Avliicli you are most successful. Some succeed witli a 
brand that another person cannot handle at all. Tli(> sponge sliould always be 
kept warm and at an eyen temperature, not being alloAved to stand in a draft. 
In winter it may be helped very much by setting it in another vessel containing 
hot water, and keeping it hot by filling in from the tea-kettle. A stone crock is 
the best thing to set bread in, as it retains the heat so much better tlian tin, and 
tliey come Jiow in shallow forms like the wooden bowls, and are very nice for 
bread-making. 

In molding it the first time, all the flour to be used sliould ho put in at this 
stage, and it is l)est to knead it tlie longest at this point, In tlie summer-time, 

lo7 



158 BREAD, BISCUIT, ETC. 

sponge setting over night is apt to tnru sour just a little; this can be remedied 
by just a pinch of soda dissolved in hot water. 

In all these recipes a cupful of yeast means wet yeast, and in using dry yeast 
enough water must be put over it to make the required quantity. 

Bread should be kneaded verj^ little at the second molding. And when set to 
rise, do not let it rise to its fullest capacity before putting it in the oven. It is 
best to grease over the tops of the loaves with butter when setting it to rise the 
last time. This keeps the crust tender when baking. 

When putting the bread in the oven, it should be hot enough to hold the hand 
in and count twenty rather quiclvly. Care must be taken with the fire, to keep 
the heat steady, allowing it to gradually die away toward the last of tlie halving; 
and this is the best time to set in your rolls, as a more moderate fire is necessary 
for them. 

Flour should be kept in a cool, dry place. If possible, have some kind of a 
close receptacle for it, and do not provide too large a quantity, as it sometimes 
spoils by keeping too long. It should be watched to see that it is liept free from 
mites, as these are m.ore destructive tlian mice. 

Always sift all flour before using it. For convenience, a quantity may be 
sifted apart in a closely covered pail, so as to be ready in cases of emergency. 

In buj^ing Graham flour, never get but small quantities at a time. The 
coarser kinds make a good quality of Graham bread, used for dyspeptics; 
screened a little finer, it is called cannell flour or middlings, and is nice for gems 
and batter-cakes. Brown bread is not made stiff enough to knead, but just a 
stiff batter that can be poured into the pans. 

In mixing bread, use a short-handled wooden spoon as long as you can; use 
enough fiour always to keep the loaf from sticking to the board or your hands, 
but care must be taken not to get in too much flour. Expert handling can only 
come by experience, and you must not be discouraged if at first it sticks to 
everything it touches. Try to get your loaves into the pans for the last rising 
rather soft. If you can get pans with high sides you will find them nicer, as 
they keep the bread from spreading apart or running over the sides. 

To insure good baking-powder biscuit, care must be taken to keep the dough 
very soft; so soft, in fact, that you are only just able to get them up and into 
the pan. They must be baked quickly in a very hot oven. Never roll your 
dough thinner than an inch. 

When bread or biscuit becomes stale, you can freshen it by pouring a little 
hot water over the loaf, and draining it off quickly; then set in the oven to heat 
through, and it will be as good as new. 

When crackers become soft from long standing, put them into a pan, and 
bake them over. They will be as crisp as fresh ones. 

A PRACTICAL LESSON IN BREAD-MAKING. 

One of the most interesting and instructive lectures before the Women's 
Economic Congress during the congresses of women was one on bread-making, 
by Mrs. Emma P. Ewing, of the Chautauqua School of Domestic Science. 

She came before an audience of some fifteen hundred people, followed by q. 
boy who bore a good-sized basket and a brand-new bread or molding board. 
The board was placed on a small table, and opt of the basket Mrs, Ewing pro- 



Bread, jjiscuit, etc*. . 15^ 

clucod a two or tliive (inart bowl heaped with sifted llour. Slie iiad I)esi(h's llws 
another bowl, a half piut measure and a small pnel^aye, whicli she said Mas a 
cake of compressed yeast. In a glass she eriunbled U]) the yeast eake, and added 
about four tablespooufuls of water. Then wlille slie sli'rred this very thor- 
oughly until it loolced like thin milk, she told us that this yeast was prepared 
by .a chemically scientific process, and that the small cake slie used could be 
absolutely depended upon to raise all the dough tliar could be mixed with one 
pint of water, in exactly three hours. She now measured two half pints of 
water into the bowl, and said that if she was in her own kitcljen, one of tlie lialf 
pints should be milk, and that the whole sliould be milk-warm. Into tliis water 
Mrs. Ewing stirred the dissolved yeast, and then added one level teaspoonful of 
salt. She now began to stir in the sifted flour witli a spoon-shaped wooden 
fork, whicli process she continued until tlie dough was of sncli consistency that 
it no longer stuck to the bowl. This, she said, was tlie rule for the amount of 
flour to be used, and it varied with the different brands of flour. Her selection 
always was the best patent process flour she could obtain. JNlrs. Ewing now 
sprinkled a little flour on her molding-board, and rolled the dough upon it. Then 
she began kneading it, using for tliis purpose the heavy part of the palm of her 
hand, so that the dough was thoroughly Avoided and stretched. She showed 
l)y holding up a portion of the dough and stretching it out into a tliin cake how 
glutinous it was, and explained that this was tlie quality which it was most 
necessary to preserve in order to retain the most nutritious portion of the flour. 
She explained that too long fermentation, or what is generally known as 
"rising," destroyed this glutinous qualitj. Having Avorked her dough into a 
beautiful round bunch, kneading it for five ininutes, slie proceeded to slightly 
grease her bowl, and then placed the dough in it. This dough, she said, should 
be phiced Avhere the temperature Avas seA'outy-five degrees, Avhen it would rise 
to just the right lightness — scientilically determined— in just three hours. 

Here some one asked her Iioav about people who had no th(>rmometers. Mrs. 
Ewing said everybody should have one, but as seventy degrees was mild 
summer heat, that seventy-five degrees meant a temperature a little warmer than 
tliis, Avhich neai'ly any one could determine. She especially cautioned about keep- 
ing the dough too AA'arm. Another person asked her the question. "If one were 
going to make six or ten loaves, Avould the same ]U"oportional amount of yeast 
be needed?" Mrs. EAving replied A'ory emphatically, "Yes," and said that this 
Avas really the rock on AA'hicli bread-makers Avere lost. She said that less yeast 
in a larger baking aa'ouUI raise tlie dough, but not in three hours, and the longer 
fermentation required caused it to turn sour. She especially deprecated the 
habit of setting bread to rise OA^er night, and laid gieat stress on the fact that 
one cake of yeast would raise this amount of dough to the right fermenta- 
tion in just three hours. Mrs. EAA'ing noAV produced from her basket another 
bowl, Avhich, as all the audience could see, was filled Avith a beautifully light 
dough. Mrs. P^Aving turned this lightly out on the bread-board, on which she had 
sprinkled flour, and began to knead it. She s'aid she had set this dough just 
tliree hours before in the house of a friend, and here it Avas ready for the second 
kneading. Into this dough Mrs. Ewing kneaded flour until it would no longer 
stick to the bread-board, which she again said was the test of the required 
amount of flour. She noAV cut the dough into two parts, kneaded each part into 
a long, slender loaf, Avhich she placed in pans about ten by four inches in size.

WHITE BREAD. 

Three pints of .aood bvo.ul-niniv: stand in a warm place over nisilit. where it 
will sret dry and lijiht. In tl\o mornins;. make a sponge of one lialf enpfnl of tlonr, 
one fourth of a c-upfiil of milk, in wliich dissolve tl.e yeast; let tliis rise until 
ready to fall, then add one and one half pints of new Avarm milk (.or scalded 
skimmed milk is used"), one even tablespoonful of granulated sugar, one even 
tablespoonful of fresh lard or butter, one even tea spoonful of salt: knead ten 
minutes; lot k rise until one half as largo again as AAhen mixed, taking care 
always that it does not get hot in rising: kuead five minutes more in the bowl; 
let it rise until twice as large, then form into one large double loaf or two small 
ones. No extra flour should be used wlien shaping the loaves. Let it rise about 
thirty minutes in a warm place, then set it in the ice-box or in a cool place live 
minutes to chill the surface. Bake one hour if large, three quarters of an hour if 
small: bake rather slowly, not hot enough to scorch it. If the sponge is made at 
seven o'clock, the bread should be ready for the o^en by eleven o'clock. There 
is no danger of having sour bread with this recipe. One secret in having delie- 
iously light bread is drying the flour before using.

Chapter X. 



During the season when eggs are plentiful and cheap, many persons pack 
them, small end down, in a box well covered with coarse salt, never allowing 
the eggs to touch each other. Have small holes bored in the bottom to drain off 
the moisture. Some use oats in which to paclc. 

To one half peck of unslaiced lime ndd tliree pailfuls of water; wlien cold, 
add one ounce of cream of tartar and one half pound of salt. This will l^eep 
eggs for a long time. 

Ducli and goose eggs are very strong as a food, though some do use them. 

To boil eggs, three minutes will boil (hem very soft, five minutes will cook 
hard all but the yolk, and eight minutes will cook them hard all through. 

In breaking eggs, break them separately over a cup to l)e sure they ai"e 
perfect. 

In poaching eggs, add a little vinegar to the hot water to set the whites; the 
water should be salted, also. 

It is best to save all egg-shells to settle coffee. 

To tell good eggs, put them into water; if the large ends turn up. they are not 
fresh. This is an infallible rule to distinguish a good egg from a bad one. 

If possible, have double kettles to cook all grains. The price of one can be 
saved in a short time by the saving of what usually sticks to the kettle when 
cooked in the ordinary way. 

Wlieat, oatmeal and barley are best to be soaked over niglit.

^^^ EGGS, OMELETS, BKEAKFAST AND TEA DISHES. / 

Rice and liominy are much nicer when preserved in the whole grain; this can 
be done by steaming them. Hominy will talie three or four hours, and rice from 
one and one half to two hours. 

Oatmeal and cracked wheat are better for being cooked in a double boiler, 
which any lady can have by setting one vessel into another, and keeping the 
under one well supplied with hot water. Add salt to make a strong brine, 
which will generate a greater heat. It is also very nice steamed from three to 
four hours. 

In making buckwheat cakes, it is best to save a little of the batter, and not 
cook it all. That which is saved is the yeast for another mess, and it can be 
kept perfectly sweet by filling the vessel with cold water and letting it stand 
until night in a cool place. When ready to use, pour off the water, which 
absorbs the acidity, and mix with tepid water. In the morning, stir in half a 
teaspoonful of soda dissolved in hot water. 

Hominy grits, cerealine and prepared wheat are all nice for breakfast use, 
and if soaked over night, need very little cooking. Eat with sugar and milk or 
molasses, as preferred. 

These grain foods should be used more than they are, as they contain so 
much more nutrition than many things that are used; and for growing children 
there is nothing better. 

Persons living in the country who do not find it convenient to purchase wheat 
already cracked, can use their coffee-mill for ci-acking it. Although not done so 
evenly, it is much sweeter than that you buy. 

EGGS AND GRAVY. 

Put a young, well-fed fowl into a stew-pan, with four ounces of butter, some 
spice, a faggot of herbs and half a dozen small onions, let it brown slightly and 
equally; add half a pint of stock, close the lid tightly, and finish the cooking over 
a very slow fire. Parboil the liver of the fowl in some good gravy, remove it, 
and poach half a dozen eggs in the same liquor. Rub down the liver to a paste, 
and use it to thicken the gravy in which the fowl has been stewed. Place the 
fowl on a hot dish, with balls of spinach around it; lay a poached egg on each 
ball, fiattening it with the back of the slice; pour gravy over the fowl, and serve 
hot. Time, one hour to stew the fowl. 

PICKLED EGGS. 

Remove the shells from three or four dozen hard-boiled eggs; do not break 
them, but arrange carefully in large-mouthed jars. Boil one pint of vinegar, 
with allspice, ginger and a couple of cloves of garlic. When the fiavor of the 
spice is extracted, add another pint of vinegar, bring it to a boil, and pour scald- 
ing hot over the eggs; when cold, seal up the jars for a month. This will be 
found a cheap pickle when eggs are plentiful, and for its piquancy is much liked, 

POACHED EGGS. 

Place on the fire a shallow stew-pan, with water, salt and a tablespoonful of 
vinegar; when it boils, add the eggs, one at a time; permit them to boil two 
minutes; take them up carefully with a strainer, and serve on delicately toasted 
slices of bread cut into the shape of diamonds or hearts; garnish with parsley.

FRIED EGGS. 

The frying-pau should be .scrupulously clean, or the white part of the egg will 
be spoilod. Dripping, butter or cotton-seed oil may be used. Break the eggs first 
into a cup, and slip each one into the pan as soon as it is hot. As the eggs fry, 
raise their edges with a slice, give them a slight shake, and ladle a little of the 
butter over the yolk. In tAvo or three minutes tliey will be done; take them out 
with the slice, pare off the rough edges, and drain from the greasy moisti.n-e. 
Serve on slices of bacon, or lay them in tlie middle of tlie dish with bacon or 
ham as a garnish. Allow two eggs for one person.

hollows of the whites with this mixture, and serve. 
Aunt Lena, Canaan Four Corners, New York. 

SCRAMBLED EGGS. 

Pour one cupful of cream into a frying-pan; when hot, pour in one dozen eggs

Boil three eggs hard, and laj thom in cold water. Melt a slice of butter in a 
stew-pan, and throw in a finely chopped small onion; fry until soft. Mix a 
dessert-spoonful of flour with the butter to a smooth paste, add two tablespoon- 
fuls of gravy, and stir until thick. Cut the eggs into quarters, and lay them 
gently in the gravy. Shake the pan around, then IhroAv in a small cupful of 
cream, shake the pan again, but do not break the eggs. When the sauce is thick 
and fine, put the eggs on the dish, and serve witli the sauce thrown over, and 
a carnisb of lemon around the dish. Time, ten minutes to boil the eggs and t-.m 
minutes to prepare the fricassee.

put them together. Then there will be a little of the filling left, to Avhich add 
one well-beaten egg, cover the eggs with this mixture, then roll in cracker- 
crumbs, and fry a light brown in boiling fat. Plain baked eggs make a quite 
pretty breakfast dish. Talvc a round whiteware dish thiclv enough to stand the 
heat of the oven, put into it sufficient fresh butter, and break as many eggs into 
it as are desirable, putting a few bits of butter on the top, and set in a rather 
slow oven until they are cooked. Have a dish of nicely made, buttered toast 
arranged symmetrically on a plate, and garnisli it and the dish of eggs with 
small pieces of curled parsley.

Chapter XI. * 

There are certain articles usually called side-dishes, or relishes, which some 
may not know how to prepare, althouj;h havin,!;' the material at hand. These 
are nice used for teas as the accompaniinent of cold meats. Some one of them 
should always appear upon the table. 

ONION IIELISH. 

Peel four Bermuda onions, slice thinly crosswise, and put to stand for two 
hours in one cupful of cold water to which has been added one cupful of vinegar. 
Drain off the water a few minutes before serving, arrange in a dish, and sprinkle

cover them; add a pinch of soda. This will bring a great deal of stuff to the 
surface, which can be skimmed off. Let them cook until they burst, mash them 
all with a wooden spoon, then add the sugar— two pounds to three quarts of 
fruit; boil slowly one and one half hours. Always cook in porcelain or an 
earthen crock, never in tin. Some strain them when done, and put into a jelly- 
mold. 

ASPARAGUS SUEDOISE SAUCE. 

Asperges Sauce Suedoise. 

, Open a tin of asparagus, and place it on some pounded ice until perfectly 

cold. Take a tiiubal-mold (specially made for the purpose), and fill it with plain 

cold water; place it in the charged ice-cave, and let it remain for two and one 




half to three hours, occasionally turning the mold from side to side in the cave, 
so as to get the water thoroughly frozen; then dip the mold into tepid water, 
pass a clean cloth over the bottom to absorb any moisture, and turn out the ice 
onto the dish on which it is to be served on a dish-paper or on a folded napkin. 
Drain the asparagus on a clean cloth, cut off the hard part from the bottom 
of the stems, and then arrange it in a group, as shown in the engraving, in the 
center of the timbal of ice; garnish around the top of the timbal with little sprigs 
of nice green fresh chervil, and serve for second course or luncheon or for any 
cold collation, with iced suedoise sauce in a sauce-boat.

inches lonj;, split these four or five times with a sharp knife, lay in watei- until 
they curl; remove to a glass dish; eat witli vinegar, pepper and salt. 

RHUBARB. 

Wash your stalks, and cut them up into inch pieces, not removing the skin, 
as the chief richness of this vegetable is in the skin; add a great deal of sugar, 
but no water. Cook until tender; serve hot or cold. It is best to cook it in a 
crock. 

TREPARED MUSTARD. 

Put one pint of vinegar on the stove to boil. Stir with a little cold vinegar 
one tabkspoonful of fliour, two tablesi)oonfuls of ground mustard, one teaspoon-

To make horse-radish sauce, take tAA'o tables])ooiifuls of the above, add one 
dessert-spoouful of olive-oil (or melted butter or cream) and one of prepared 
mustard. 

WATER-CRESS. 

Water-cress possesses valuable medicinal properties of a stimulating nature, 
and is said to be particularly useful in strengthening the nerves. The expres.sed 
.I'uice, which contains the peculiar pungency and taste of the herb, is used in 
medicine. External impurities in water-cress may be removed by wasliing, but 
not the impurities wliich are absorbed within. If the full virtues of this herb 
are to be experienced, it should be eaten frequently and freely. It is mostly used 
v.'ith bread and salt, as an accompaniment to cheese. It is also used to garnish 
dishes; it is excellent served as a salad; and it is good boiled as spinach. Water- 
cresses are good from autumn until early summer unless when cut off by frost. 
Bronze-leaved specimens are the most highly esteemed. 

FRIED APPLES. 

Quarter and core apples Avitliout ))ariiig. Prepare a frying-i)an by lieating and

CUCUMBEES. 

It does not seem to be generally knoA^'n that the cucumber is one of the most 
useful vegetables we have, and can be dressed in a greater variety of palatable 
ways than any other except the tomato. It is better than squash, and more 
delicate than the egg-plant, prepared in the same manner; can be stewed, fried 
or stuffed, and, above all, can be parboiled, mashed up in a batter and fried as 
fritters— more pleasant and easily prepared than any other vegetable or fruit. 
When a cucumber just* becomes too old to be used raw or for pickling, it is then 
at its best for cooking, and may be used for that purpose even until the seeds 
become hard. A raw cucumber is. for most persons, an indigestible abomina- 
tion, hoA\-ever much they may admire its flavor and odor. 

FONDUE. 

Slice a stale penny roll; pour over it three gills of boiling milk; Avhen soaked,

eggs, and, last df all, five Avhites Avhipped to a fine froth; bake in a papered tin 
and in a hot OA^en, filling the tin to only half its depth. The fondue should rise 
very high, and be served immediately, or it Avill fall, and the appearance be 
spoiled. Time to bake, twenty minutes. Sufficient for five or six persons. 

CHEESE FONDUE. 

Put to boil one pint of ucav milk Avith a tablespoonful of butter in it; dissolA'e 
tAA'o tablespoonfuls of flour in a little cold milk, and stir in tlie boiling milk; set

little powdered sugar, the yolks of eight eggs and the whites of two, well beaten; 
when perfectly mixed, add the whites of six eggs beaten io a froth. The batter 
should be as thick as cream. Make little paper tiays, till them three parts full, 
and bake them in a very slow oven eighteen minutes. 

FRIED RAMEKINS. 

Grate half a pound of cheese, and melt two ounces of butter; when the latter 
is getting cool, mix it with the cheese and the Avell-beaten whites of three eggs. 
Lay buttered papers on a frying-pan, put slices of bread upon it, and lay the 
cheese on the top; set it over the fire for about five minutes, then take it off, and 
brown it with a salamander. 

EGGS AND CHEESE. 

These are mixed in various Avays by French cook.^, under the names of 
fondues or fondeaux, ramekins and other titles, for the purpose of preparing 
entremets, or side-dishes, for elegant tables. Gruyere and Parmesan are the 
most proper sorts to be used, but any dry clieese of good fiaVor may be 
employed. 

POTTED CHEESE. 

Scrape and pound ch^ese, witli a piece of butter, cayenne pepper, a few grains 
of pounded mace, one teaspoonful of sifted sugar, one glassful of vinegar and a 
little salt; press it into your potting-jar for shape. 

COTTAGE (DUTCH) CHEESE. 

Take a crockful of clabbered milk, and set it on the stove to heat a little; 
when the whey and clabber separate, pour it into a jelly-bag, and liang it up 
Avhere it will drain until dry; season witli salt, a piece of butter or rich cream; 
use pepper if desired; mix with the liand, and make into small balls, or if much 
cream is used, serve in a dish. 

Mrs. N. A. McDonald, Sago, Ohio. 

CHEESE STRAWS. 

Take a pint of flour and half a pint of grated cheese; mix them, and make a 
paste witli lard as you would for pies; roll out in a thick sheet, cut into strips 
one half inch broad and five or six inclies long; bake a light brown. Place a 
white napkin on a plate, and pile the "straws" in log-cabin shape upon it. This 
is a delicate dish, to be eaten with salads.

PINEAPPLE CHEESE. 

The preparation of the curd does not differ materially from that for the best 
factory and otlier styles of long-lceepiug cheese. But greater care and skill are 
needed, for a slight defect which would not much affect the value of factory 





cheese is fatal to the pineapple. The rind must be perfect, else invisible cracks 
will open during curing, and the least admission of air is folloAved by internal 
molding. In the mold the cheese stands with the point down^x ard. A neck three 
and one half inches in diameter extends upward froui the l)ottom of the cheese, 



194 tlELISHES. 

aud receives the pressure. These necks are cut off, broken up, and mixed with 
the next day's curd. To perfect the rind, the bottom is seared witli a liot iron. 
The mold is constructed from four bloclvs of four-inch scantling. The carving, 
which can be done by any pattern-maker or skilful carpenter, is done inainly 
upon these quarters. They are then attached to one another in pairs by iron 
bolts. Two halves are then fitted to one another by dowels, and held together 
by a strong framework or gripe with its wedges. The mold, when complete, is 
a block fifteen inches high and eight by eight inches in size. A bag of strong 
drilling is thrust downward through the neck, and the mold is then ready to 
receive the curd. The pressure is applied either by screw or lever, the latter 
being preferable. This is the simplest method and crudest for pressing. But 
there is a great saving of time and labor by the crowders and gang-presses now 
used in factories. These gang-presses are somewhat ingenioiis and elaborate, 
and press fifty cheeses each. The cheeses come from the press with a smooth 
siu'face, and the impression upon them is made by the net and the process of 
netting. Nets are made of the best linen twine, are made by hand, and with 
great care. After being drawn over the cheese, and accurately secured, the 
cheese is hung in a bath of hot water, the temperature of which is regulated by 
the conditions of the curd and of the weather. They are then withdraAvn, one 
by one, and subjected to a machine, which at the same time stretches and twists 
so as to give an even impression of the net over the entire surface of the cheese. 
It is very easy to net cheese if there is no attempt made to make them hand- 
some. But the whole question of profit tin-ns upon their beauty, and only a 
skilled hand can do the work with success. After setting, they pass to the 
curing-room, and are hung i» the nets for several weeks, or until the nets are 
required for use upon fresh cheese.

Chapter XIII, 



To be a good pie-baker can only be aeeomplisLed by continual practice. One 
may take the best recipe and fail; but do not let this discourage you. 

The secret of making good pies is to use as little water as possible to get the 
dough into shape. 

Put a cupful of lard to a quart of flour and a teaspoonful of salt. This 
should make foiu* crusts, either two pies with covers or four without. Work 
the lard into the flour with your fingers until it is thoroughly mixed througli 
before adding the water, then only a little, and press the dougli together haril, 
then tiu'n out on a well-floured board, and roll only one way. 

The under crust should be a little the thickest. 

If it is a fruit pie, dust a little flour on the bottom before putting your fruit 
in; and in making pies of fresh fruit, put your sugar in the bottom. 

When you make a pie Avithout an upper crust, it is always desirable to have 
a very heavy edge; make this by wetting the edge and laying on a narrow strii); 
pinch it up together, or when cutting the crust around the edge of the pan. 
hold the knife well under the outer edge of t)ie pan, and pinch it betAveen the 
thumb and finger right on top of tlie pan. 

A rolling-pin is best not Avashed; sci'ape the dough off well, and rub Avith a 
dry toAvel. In this case it will ahvays by dry, and if Avell floured, it will never 
stick. 

In Avarm weather keep the paste on ice until AA^anted to bake. It improA'es 
pastry very much to lie on ice a couple of hours before using. 

Puff paste should always be made of sAveet, solid butter.

■I'he juice oi' fruit pies, if thickeiiod witli a level teaspoouful of coru-st;uvli

Always beat e.a.irs separately. 

If a mohl is used for boiliuii- puddi.iiis. be sure to have it Avell jireased. 

A baji- or cloth should be wruni;- out ol" hot water and Avell floured. 

In boilinji" puddiuiis, always put them into boiling- Avater. 

Boile<l and steauied puddinjis retpiire nearly twice as much time as baked. 

AVheu a puddiu.^- is boiUnl iu a uiold. take it froui tlie w.-ifer. aud pluu.si'e it 
imnuHliatt>ly iuto cold water, theu luru it out iuuuediately : this will prevent it

Puuipkin Hour can be had .at any j^rocery. which makes as nice pies as the 
fresh pumpkin, with less trouble, and full directions are on each box. 

It is well in all cooking- to take advanta.ge of all the modern improvements; 
oftentimes agents bring things to your door that cannot be had at the stores; if 
you see it is going to be useful to you, it is well to providi* it. as wlieu you w.-inr 
it you ma.^- be unable to tind if. 

In baking pics tlic tiuu> of cooi<ing varies, .-ilso the heat of the i)vi>u: wlier(> 
gri'en-appU> pie taki^s from thirt.\- \o forty minutes, a v\c\\ lemon pie would take 
only about twenty. 

A very flaky, nice pie-dough is made by adding a level half teaspoonfnl of 
baking-powder to a quart of flour, in A\hich case lessen the quantity of short- 
ening. 

Some always grease tlitMr pie-i>ar.s: this is the safest if the pie is to be 
riMuoved to a plate bcfort^ imtiing on tlie table. Others only dust the pan with 
flom-. One's oavu experience must be the .indge which is the best Avay. 

A marble slab is very desirable to have, as it keeps the dough cold and lirui— 
in fact, it is abnost impossible to m;ike puff paste without it. 

PIE-CIU'ST. 

One lu>;ipiug teaspoonfnl ol' baking-powder, two quarts of flour, one teacupfnl 
ol' lard, two teacnpfuls of water, a pinch of s;ill: )nix well, and sift a little flour 
on tlic molding-board before rolling it out. This v> ill make enough crust for four 
or tive pies, 

Mrs. W. K. Broir;;liton, rronsen. Aliehisan. 

:mus, K,-y riE-CKrs'i\ 

4 t'upfuls of riinu-. 1 ctutfid of water. 

2 cupfuls of butter and lard mixed. A pinch of salt. 

This makes enotigh dough for fotu- pies. 

PIE-SHELLS. 

^lake a rich pie-crust, and line the pans or ohl saucers; prick tliem with a 
fork, and bake in a quick oven; ptit them into a croik or bread-box. and when 
needed. All with craitbervy sauce, apple sauce or any canned frtiit yon may have 
open. Another way to use them is to make a custard of any kind, put one of the 
shells iuto a pie-pan. All it witli tlie custard, and bake. These are convenient to 
have in case of unexpected company.

224 pies and puddings. 

noitii.lp:s. 

Nouilles are made of delicate pastry, cut iuto ribands and various siiapes, 
aud used as a substitute for vermicelli and macaroni, eitlier in making fritters 
or puddings or for serving with cheese or in soup. They are made as follows: 
TalvC half a pound of fine flour, put it on the pastry board, make a hole in the 
center, and in this put tAVO eggs; add a pinch of sail, one half ounce of butter, 
one teaspoonful of cold water; mix all iuto a very firm, smooth paste; leave it a 
little while to dry, then roll it out as thin as possible, and cut it into thin bands 
about one and one fourth inches in width; dredge a little flour upon these, and 
lay four or five of them one above another, then cut them through into thin 
shreds, something like vermicelli; shake them well to prevent their sticking 
together, and spread them out to dry. Nouilles cannot be made witliout a 
straight rolling-pin and smooth pastry-board. When Avauted for use, drop tliem 
gradually into boiling water, stirring gently with a wooden spoon to keep tliem 
from getting lumpy; let them boil for six to twenty minutes, then take them up 
with a strainer, drain them well, and spread them out on a coarse cloth. 
Besides thread-like nouilles, a few may be made the size and shape of scarlet- 
runner beans or small birds' eggs, or they may be cut broad like macaroni. If 
thoroughly dried, they will keep any length of time stored in tin canisters. 

PUFF PASTE. 

To each pound of flour allow one pound of butter; use half of the butter with 
the flour and cold Avater enough to mold it; roll it out quite thin, and put oui 
half the butter that remains in small bits; dredge this with flour, roll up the' 
paste, then roll it out again, thin; put on the rest of the butter, and roll up as. 
before; repeat this until the butter is all used. It must be done quickly; be^ 
careful not to handle it any more than you can help. Put in a cool place until 
you are ready to use it. 

DROP DUMPLINGS. 

Sift together one cupful of flour, one half teaspoonful of salt and one tea- 
spoonful of baking-poAvder; add, stirring Avith a kuife, about one half cupful of 
milk or Avater; divide into five parts, and drop on the top of any nice steAV, being- 
careful not to let the gravy cover them; lay a cloth over tiie top of the kettle' 
before putting on the lid; it Avill absorb the steam aud prevent its falling back 
in drops upon the dumplings, and thus making them heavy. Cook, closely cov- 
ered, for exactly tAA-elve minutes; do not look at them during the time. 
Miss Marion L. Campbell, Friendly Inn Cooking School, Cleveland, Ohio.

STKUDEL. 

Strudel is the national pastry dish of the Bohemians and Hungarians. It is

powder; this is entirely unknown to either country. Take one and one half 
pounds of sifted floiu', use enough lukewarm water to make a stiff dough, work 
it well for one luilf hour. The success of this dish lays in working the dough 
sufficiently. Wlien tliis is accomplished, tloisr the board, put tlie dougli on it, 
and cover it by upsetting a large iron crucible thoroughly hot, and let it remain 
th(>re lUitil cold; in the meantime flom* a table-cloth, put the dough in the center, 
and witli tlie aid of another person pull the dough as thin as possil)le, taking 
good care not to tear it, the thinner the better; paint tlie wiiole witli melted

Chop some peeled apples finely, add enough sugar and powdered cinnamon to 
suit the taste, and use it as tlirected above; lift one side of the table-clotli, and

MODERN POTATO PASTY. 

In order to make this properly, a pasty-pan must be procured which has a 
well-fitting, perforated plate, and a valve-pipe to screw on. This can be had at 
almost any tin-store, and will cost from one dollar to one dollar and twenty-five 
cents. The meat, seasoning and gravy are put into the lower part. The plate is 
then laid on the meat, the valve-pipe screwed on, and mashed potatoes spread 
e(iually on the top. The pasty should be baked iu a moderat*^ oven, and sent to 
the table in the same tin in which it was baked, which should have a neatly 
folded napkin pinned around it. The cover shoukl not be removed until the 
meat is to be served, and an empty dish should be placed in readiness for it. If 



234 PIES AND PUDDINGS. 

properly baked, the potatoes will be uicely browued. and \\ill be tiavored like the 
meat. 'I'lie eouteuts of this pie may, of course, be varied imletiuitely. Mutton or 
veal outlets, pork chops, chickens or rabbits, cut into neat joints, and tish of 
various kinds may all be used, and will be found excellent. The meat should be 
neatly trimmed and nicely seasoned, and a small quantity of gravy poured over 
it. The mashed potatoes should form a crust at least three inches thick. Two 
pounds of meat and three pounds of potatoes Avill make a moderate-sized pasty. 
Sutticient for four persons. It will need at least one hour to cook it well. In 
serving it, dish the meat first, then lay a section of the potato pasty upon it, 
and the gravy beside it. Never put gravy over a serving unless requested to 
do so. 

rOTATO PATTIES. 

Take as many large, Avellshaped potatoes as it is intended there should be 
patties, Avash Avell, and bake them; take them out before they are quite done 
enough, so that the skin may not be injured, carefully cut off the top, and scoop 
out the inside with a spoon; mix AAith the floury ])art two or three spoonfuls of 
thick cream, a little piece of butter and a pinch of salt, together with sugar, 
lemon or cinnamon tlavoriug. and the yolks and Avhites of two or three beaten 
eggs, added separately; put this mixture into the hoUoAv potatoes, place them 
upright side by side in a buttered dish, and bake them in a. hot oven. If liked 
savory, instead of potatoes, patties can be made l»y mixing with the potato tlour 
a little pounded veal and ham, and cream, salt, lemon-peel, grated nutmeg and 
mushroom catsup added in suitable proportions. Time to bake, twelve to 
fifteen minutes. When meat is used, cook them a little longer. 








Chapter XIV. 



The gi'eat art of making a custard lies in well stirring, and when this is 
properly managed, a custard made with milk and the quantity of eggs given in 
this recipe will be as rich as one made with cream and additional eggs. 

Boil a pint of milk, stir in two ounces of lump-sugar, or sufficient to make 
the custard sweet enough for the purpose required. Have ready the yolks of 
three eggs, beaten up, pour the boiling milk on tliem. Put the stew-pan con- 
taining the custard over a slow fire, slir with a Mooden spoon as briskly as 
possible for twenty minutes, or until tliickening has commenced, tlien put the 
stew-pan on the coolest part of the range, so that it is impossible for the cus- 
tard to simmer, and let it stand for a quarter of an hour, stirring it occasionally. 
When the custard is ready, poiu* it into a basin; flavor with vanilla, almond or 
lemon. Stir the custard until cool, Avhich will pi'cvent a skin forming on top. 

This recipe is the groundwork for all creams made with custard. 

For creams and custards, eggs should never be beaten in tin, but always in 
stone or eartlien ware, as there is some chemical influence about tin which pre- 
vents their attaining that creamy lightness so desirable. 

When gelatin is used for creams, it is better to soak it for an hour in luke- 
warm water kept in a warm place. 

The rule for custard to bake is four eggs, one cupful of sugar and one half 
teaspoonful of salt to a quart of milk. 

235 



§36 cusiARbg ANb Desserts. 

Ciistai-d should always be baked sloAvly in a moderate oven, as too much heat 
will turn it to Avhey. 

Boiled custard must have the closest attention until off the stove. 

Peach-leaves or vanilla-beans give a fine ilavor, but must be boiled in the 
milk, and then taken out before the other ingredients are added. 

In boiling custard, always use a double vessel. 

Custards are nice baked in small cups to serve to each persoii. 

In the use of spices, remember tliat allspice and cloves are used with meatg> 
and nutmeg and cinnamon in combination with sugar. 

The white part of the lemon under the rind is exceedingly bitter, and only 
the yellow part should be grated. A good Avay is to rub the rind off with hard 
lumps of sugar. The sugar thus saturated with the oil of the lemon is called 
"zest," and is used, when pounded fine, for creams, etc. 

CHANTILLY BASKET. 

Make a cement of sugar boiled to a crackling height; dip the edges of some 
macaroons into it, and line a mold shaped like a basket with them, taking care 




that the edges of the macaroons touch each other; ^\'hen wanted, take it out of 
the mold, fill it up with whipped cream, and it is tlien ready for the table. Time, 
two or three hours to set. 

LEMON CUSTARD. 

Six eggs, beaten separately, three cnpfuls of sugar, one half cupful of 
butter, four cupfuls of water, five tablespoonfuls of corn-starch, two large 
lemons; slice the lemons, and put them into the water to boil until the strength

CHAKLOTTE KUSSE. 

I suppose every one has a syllabub churn. If not, procure one from yoiu- 
tinner. It is also calkd a whip churn. Take one pint of sweet, fresh cream, 
ohurn it, and as rhe froth rises, skim off into a bowl, as much liquid cream will 
run from it which can be churned asain. You will find, too, it will become too 
thick to churn; then pour in sweet milk to thin the cream, and it will churn 
beautifully. After it is all churned and skimmed off into another boAvl to avoid 
the settlings, stir gently througli it one half cupful of sugar; have ready in soak 
one box, or a little less, of gelatin in very little water for at least one hour; drain 
from it the water, and dissolve in one half cupful of hot sweet milk; while cool- 
ing, beat separately two eggs, adding one half cupfid of sugar 1o the yolks; when 
very light, add the stiff whites and two tablespoonfuls of vanilla. If the gelatin 
has cooled, mix thoroughly with the egg, and pour at once into the wliipped 
cream. Line the bowl with ladyfingers, and pour in the charlotte. This is 
delightful, and sufficient for ten people.

in the top of the mold Avhich j-epresent cherries or strawberries with a straw- 
berry-cream ice, the apples and pears with pistachio-ice, and for the grapes use 
a little vanilla-ice colored lightly with damson blue; fill the pomegranate also 
with the latter ice, which has been made a so)newhat deeper red than the 
strawberry-cream ice with cherry red. When the top part of the mold is com- 
plete, fill up the bottom part with layers of the different ice-creams, arranging 
them as evenly as possible; place the top on carefully, and let the mold remain 
in the cave for about two and one half hours, during which time give it an 
occasional turn, so that the ice will be thoroughly frozen through. When ready

274 CUSTARDS AND DESSERTS. / 

ALMOND MERINGUE MIXTURE. 

Put iuto a whipping-tin two whites of eggs, with a pinch of salt, and wliip 
them until quite stiff, then add one fourth of a pound of eastor-sugar and one 
ounce of blanched and finely shredded almonds, put into a forcing-bag with a 
large, plain pipe, force it onto cold waxed tins, arranging the shape according to 
taste, dust over by means of a dredger with a little icing-sugar, put into a mod- 
erate oven, and bake until a nice brown color, then talie up; dress when cold 
with whipped and sweetened and flavored cream, place on a dish on a paper, 
and serve for a dinner or luncheon sweet or plainly for dessert. These can also 
be used for filling cakes, etc. 

PANARD. 

One half pint of water put to boil with one ounce of butter and a pinch of 
salt; then, when boiling, mix in four large tablespoonfuls of fine flour, and cook 
on the stove for about five minutes, giving the panard an occasional stir while it 
is cooking; when cool, use. 

CUSTARD FOR PROFITEROLES, PASTRY, ETC. 

Put into a stew-pan one ounce of fine flour, one raw yolk of egg, two ounces 
of butter, one ounce of castor-sugar and one and one half gills of cold milk; stir 
these over the fire until the mixture boils, then flavor with a few drops of 
vanilla, mix into it one tablespoonful of whipped cream, and use. 

CORNETS, WITH CREAM. 

Mix into paste four ounces of finely chopped almonds, two ounces of fine flour, 
two ounces of sugar, one large raw egg, a pinch of salt and a tablespoonful of 
orange-flower water. Put one or two baking-tins into the oven, and when they 
are quite hot, rub them over with Avhite Avax, let the tins get cool, then spread 
the paste smoothly and thinly over the tins (say one tenth of an inch thick), 
and bake in the oven for three or foiu- minutes; take out the tins, and quickly 
stamp out the paste with a plain round cutter about two and one half to three 
inches in diameter, and immediately wrap these rounds of paste on the outside 
of the cornet-tins, which liave been slightly oiled inside and out, pressing the 
edges well together, so that the paste takes the shape of the cornet; then remove 
the paste, and slip it inside the tin, and put another one of the tins inside the 
paste, so that it is kept in shape between the two tins; place them in a moderate 
oven, and let them remain until quite crisp and dry; take them out, and remove 
the tins. These can be liept any length of time in a tin box in a dry place. Orna- 
ment the edges with royal icing by means of a bag and pipe, and then dip the 
icing into difl:"erent colored sugars; fill them with whipped cream, sweetened, and 
flavored with vanilla, using a forcing-bag and pipe for the purpose, and arrange 
them in a pile on a dish-paper or napkin. These cornets can also be filled witli 
any cream or water-ice or set custard or fruits, and served for dinner, luncheon 
or supper dish. 




Chapter XV. 
CAKE-MAKING. 

In cake-making, as indeed in all other bi-ancbes of cookery, the best results 
are obtained onlj' by using the best materials. It is a great mistake to think., 
as many do, that butter not good enough for the table is yet just as good for 
cake as the best, or that a coarse quality of grauulated sugar will make the 
same ligiit, fine-grained calve that a finer grade will. In all the rules which 
follow use only the best butter, fine granulated sugar, not powdered, good 
pastry-flour and always the best extracts obtainable. Well-made calve, eaten 
in moderate quantities, is not hai'uiful, but, on tlie contrary, is beneficial, con- 
taining as it does so much of necessary material for the nourishment of the 
body. 

The cup used in my rules is the one in general use everywhere in cooking- 
schools, made of tin, holding one half pint, and of two kinds — one for measuring 
fourths and the other thirds. All dry materials are measured by dipping with 
a spoon into the cup, not by dipping with the cup itself, as nine out of ten will 
do, unless they have been coolving-scliool pupils. Butter is measured packed 
solidly info the cup, but always scant, sugar level, and flour just a little round- 
ing, always sifting before measiu'ing, and putting it lightly info the cup with a 
spoon. Measiu'e the balving-powder rounding on fop just as the spoon rounds 
underneath, and mix well with the flour. Sjiices for cakes are measured level. 

Before beginning to put cake together, see that the fire is ready. The baking 

275 



276 CAKES, COOKIES AND IPHItTeHS. 

c'Jiimot be clone siieeessfully -with a new coal fire, neither mlist it be put into 
a cool oven and the fire replenished then. Perfect baking is obtained only by 
having- a fire that Avill last through the -ndiole time, witli no more care than 
opening and closing the drafts. More depends on the baking than the mixing 
in successful cake-making, and it can only be learned by experience. 

With an oven not hot enough, the cake rises witiiout becoming firm, and at 
the last falls, while with too great a heat the cake browns before it i-ises, and 
as it must expand in some w'ay, it does so by means of a yawning crack in the 
middle of the loaf. 

Mix cake always in earthenware, never in tin. If obtainable, use wooden 
spoons made especially for the purpose, fiat and broad, made Avith three perfora- 
tions lengthwise. The old-fashioned way of mixing with the hand is preferable, 
however, to tin or iron spoons. 

In putting cake togetlier, cream the butter first, then add the sugar gradually, 
beating all the time, then the flavoring, and the yolks of the eggs beaten until 
light and 'thick. The milk and flour are added, a little of each together at a 
time, beating well between each, adding until all are in. Beat the whites of 
eggs to a stiff froth and add last, stirring in as lightly as possible. 

Do not make the mistake of thinking tliat stirring and beating mean the 

same thing. Stirring is blending or mixing the materials, while articles of food 

are made lighter by beating, as a certain amount of air is inclosed, which 

expands on being heated.

Teacher of Cooking in the High School, Concord, New Hampshire. 

SUGGESTIONS. 

In warm weather lay the eggs in cold water, as they will froth better. 

Always use lard to grease j^our cake-pans, as the salt in the butter causes it 
to stick to the pans. 

Sweet milk and baking-powder go together, sour milk and soda; also, 
saleratus combines the properties of soda and cream of tartar, and is always 
used alone. 

In all these recipes, except gingerbread, where soda is used, double the 
amount of cream of tartar. Where you substitute baking-powder, take just 
the quantity of soda and cream of tartar combined. To one quart of flour use 
two and one half tea spoonfuls of balcing-powder; or one teaspoonful of soda 
and two teaspoonfuls of cream of tartar. 

Keep cakes in the cellar, in a tin box, to keep them from drying out. 

Keep the oven closed for ten minutes after putting in your cake. 

Gingerbread should always be baked with a very moderate fire. 

In making cookies, put them into the pan as soft as possible. 

Where you want to put sugar and spice on them, lay it on the board, and 
roll your dough oA'^er it. 

Never try to ice a cake hot, and let layer cakes get nearly cold before putting 
together. 

All lard to fry fritters and doughnuts must be very, very hot before putting 
them in. 

In using almond essence, be careful to use only from four to five drops, as it 
is very poisonous. 



CAKeB, cookies ANt» priTterb. 277 

A uew kind of cake-pan, with reniuvable bottom, will be a great boon to tlie 
young housekeeper, as it taki's a great deal of experience to be able to turn 
cake out of the pan in a neat manner; the tin bottom can be left on the cake if 
desired, and used to cook ou. 

BLANCHED ALMONDS. 

Crack the nuts, and put the meats into a crock, with cold water over them. 
Let tliem cook until they just come to a boil, then pour off the hot water, and 
put ou very cold water. Remove the shells, and dry the almonds on a cloth in 
the oven, Avhere there will be very little heat. They are pounded, and used in 
macaroons, meringues, etc. 

TO PPvEPARE HAI8INS FOR CAKE. 

First take out all the stems and seeds; th^n put them into a dish, with just 
water enough to cover them; let them boil slowly one half hour, or until the 
water is nearly gone; then stir them in. your cake as usual. In this way they 
will not be tough, and tear the cake in cutting. 

Another way is to take off all the stems, and wash them well; then spread 
them on a towel laid in a pan, and set them in the oven to dry thoroughly. 
Before stirring into the cake or pudding, roll in flour. 

FOR COLORING CAKES AND ICES. 

% ounce of pulverized cochineal, y^ ounce of cream of tartar, 

^2 pint of boiling water, i^ ounce of salts of tartar. 

14 ounce of alum, 

Let it stand until the color is extracted, then strain and bottle.

between each layer a soft icing, with a tablespoouful of some kind of a bright 
red jelly stirred into it. This makes a very prettj' cake when cut. Bake in deep 
pie-pans.

Chapter XVI. 



In getting vinegar for picliles, always try to get cider vinegar, as the otlier 
kinds frequently eat up the pielvles entirely or cause them to turn soft. Too 
strong vinegar should be partly diluted with water. 

All pickles should be tightly sealed, to prevent air reaching the vinegar, as 
this kills it. It should always be poured on hot as it comes to the first scald- 
never allow it to boil. 

Never put up pickles in anything that has held any kind of grease, and never 
let them freeze. 

If pickles are put into brine, it should always be strong enough to bear an 
egg. Use coarse salt, in proportion of a heaping pint of salt to a gallon of water. 

The nicest way to put up pickles is to put them into bottles, and seal while 
they are hot. 

Always select perfect fruit for catsups. Cook in porcelain, never in metal. 

Always use glass or stone ware to bottle in, never tin. 

If on opening there is a leathery mold on top, carefully remove every particle 
of it. and the catsup will not be injured. 

301 



302 PICKLES AND CATSUPS. 

To prevent this moldiug, some do not fill the bottles quite to the top with 
catsup, but fill up with hot vinegar. 

If on opening and using a part there is danger that the rest may sour, scald; 
and if too thick, add vinegar. 

Always stir In the vinegar the last thing before putting on to boil. 

TO CLARIFY PICKLES. 

The scum which often rises on the top of pickles can be remedied by putting 
a slice or two of horse-radish in the jar, which soon sinks to the bottom, taking 
all the scum with it, thus leaving the vinegar clear. 

TO KEEP PICKLES FROM GETTING SOFT. 

To one barrel of pickles, Avhen in brine, add one half bushel of grape-leaves. 
This will keep them sound and firm. 

BOTTLED PICKLES. 

Pour boiling water over them, and let stand four hours; to every gallon of 
vinegar take 

1 teacupful of sugar, 1 teaspoonf ul of pulverized alum, 

1 teacupful of salt, 1 ounce of cinnamon-bark, 

1^ ounce of whole cloves. 

Boil spice and vinegar, and pour over the pickles. Seal while hot. 
Mrs. W. B. Reid, Jackson, Michigan. 

CHOPPED PICKLES. 

Chop fine 
1 gallon of cabbage, 1 quart of onions, 

1 gallon of green tomatoes, 2 or 3 green pepper-pods.

the water, put with the other ingredients, and to this add four tablespoonfuls 
of ground mustard, two tablespoonfuls of powdered ginger, one tablespoonful of 
powdered cloves, one tablespoonful of powdered mace, one tablespoonful of 
powdered cinnamon, three pounds of sugar, three ounces of turmeric-powder 
and one ounce of celery-seed; mix well, cover with good vinegar, and boil slowly 
until done. 

Mrs. D. D. H., Marion, Virginia. 

CUCUMBER PICKLES. 

One hundred green cucuiiibers about two inches long will fill four glass 
quart jars. Soak twenty-four hours in rather strong brine; then poui- off the 
brine, and rinse in clear water. To this number of cucumbers use three quarts 
of pure cider vinegar, one cupful of sugar, one ounce of whole cloves, one ounce 
of stick-cinnamon, one ounce of small black peppers, a little sliced horse-radish, 
a few small red peppers; scald the cucumbers in the vinegar. As soon as the

over them until the jar is full. Seal while hot.

Chapter XVII, 

Foi' jelly, select your fruit before it is too ripe, if possible, as it is always of a 
much better flavor. 

It should be put ou and brought to a heat, as the juice cau be much better 
extracted. 

Have a bag made of flannel, in a funnel shape, to put the juice through. For 
straining it through the first time use a wire sieve, with a revolving wire to 
crusli the fruit. 

Jelly should always be strained twice, and comes much clearer by allowing 
it to hang over night and drip. Put on the juice and allow it to come to a heat, 
then put in the sugar, which should be put into the oven and heated. Jelly 
should always boil rapidly, and in a pan with a very large bottom, so that as 
much surface can be on the stove as possible. If it is desired to keep the color 
light, use a very little gelatin, so that it need not coolc so long. From fifteen 
to twenty minutes is long enough for it to cook after it begins to boil, and it 
should not stop until done. Better success can be had by making it in small 
quantities. After putting it into the glasses, set them in a hot sun until cold, 
then cover with a piece of writing-))aper directly on the jelly, anotlier to cover 
the top of the glass. This can be confined with a tiny rubber band, which is 
better, as you can easily lift your covers and inspect your jellies. Some seasons

312 PRESERVES AND JELLIES. 

-more mold Avill accumulate u])OU things than others, and if once removed, will 
not return. 

To prevent preserves from sugaring, add a little tartaric acid when cooked. 

If corn-starch be put into the juice before adding the sugar, it will make it 
clearer; two teaspoonfuls in two tablespoonfuls of water to three pints of juice. 
A teaspoonful of sugar put upon the top of jelly in the glass prevents molding. 

Preserves need only tying up with several thicknesses of paper, over which 
put a cloth; but they should be looked over occasionally, and if signs of fer- 
mentation appear, just heating them again will correct it. Stone jars of small 
capacity are best for these. 

We would recommend all young housekeepers in buying their jars, etc., foi- 
canning fruits to get nothing but glass or stone ware. Everything is better 
put up in these, as the acids in so many fruits acting upon tin are apt to make 
them very uuAvholesome, if not positively injurious. Tomatoes, peaches and 
other canned fruits may then be wrapped with paper to keep the light from 
them. 

TO SEAL UP CANS OR JARS. 

Scald the fruit thoroughly, povir into the cans; have ready three or four pieces 
of paper (a thin, tough tea-paper is best), cut about one inch larger around than 
the top of the can; wet the under side with tlie white of an egg, press on quickly, 
and put two or three more pieces on top of this, wet the same as the first; tie a 
string around over these, to be sure they are close. 
Mrs. RoscC. Haveuor, Centralia, Wisconsin. 

TO FILL JARS WITH HOT FRUIT WITHOUT AA^IRMING THEM. 

Place the jar in a bowl of cold water, and pour into it one cupful of the 
boiling fruit. This will heat the jar without breaking it, and it must be taken 
out of the water to finish filling it. Care must be taken not to fill the hot fruit 
higher than the water on the outside of the jar before removing it, or it will be 
sure to break. This will also answer for filling jelly-glasses. 
M. B. Patterson. 

LIST OF FRUIT IN PRESERVES. 

Seven and one half pounds of cherries and seven and one half pounds of 
sugar make one gallon of preserves; fourteen pounds of blackberries and four- 
teen pounds of sugar make five quarts of jam; six quarts of steamed grapes 
make five and one half pints of juice, Avhich, with five and one half pounds of 
sugar, make nine tumblerfuls of jelly; two quarts of stemmed currants make two 
pints of juice, added to nearly two pounds of sugar, make three tumblerfuls of 
jelly. 

WATERMELON PRESERVES. 

Select one Avith a thick rind: cut into any shape desired; lay the pieces in 
strong salt-water for two or three days; then soak them in clear water for 
tAventy-four hours, changing the Avater frequently; then put thera into alum- 
Avater for an hour to harden them. To every pound of fruit use one pound of 
sugar; make a syrup of the sugar and a few small pieces of white ginger-root 
and one sliced lemon; take out the lemon and root, after the syrup has been 
boiled, and add the watermelon; let it boil until transparent. Carefullj^ lift it, 
and put it into the jars, pouring the syrup over it.

CITKON PKESEKVES. 

St'loct sound fruit, pare it, divide into quarters, carefully take out the seeds, 
and cut into very small pieces any slia])e you desire, and weijili it; to every 
pound of fruit allow one half pound of loaf-sujiar. Put the citron on to cook 
until it is quite clear, then remove it from the kettle where it can drain, and 
pour out the water it was cooked in; then put on the weighed sugar, with water 
enough to wet it through; let it boil until very clear, and before putting in th(> 
citron again add to the syrup two large sliced lemons and a small piece of 
ginger-i'oot to give it a tine flavor; then add tlie citron, and let all cook together 
about fifteen minutes; fill the jars with citron, and pour over the hot syrup, 
then seal up. 

Miss Bettie Ferguson, Stockton, Alabama. 

CITRON AND QUINCE PRESERVES. 

Pare, and cut the citron into inch pieces; boil hard in middling strong alum-, 
water thirty n.inutes; drain, and boil in fresh water until the color is clianged 
and tliey are tender. Wasli <'arefully the (luinces; pare, quarter, coi-e and halve 
the quarters; boil one and one half hoiu's the cores and parings in water to cover 
them; remove them, and add the prepared quince to the li(iuid; boil, and when 
they begin to be tender, add the citron and three fourths of a pound of white 
sugar to every pound of the fruits. 
C. M. Hulbert, Ahnont, Michigan. 

PRESERVED PEARS. 

Select smooth, sweet peai's of a kind w^hich will not break when cooked; 
pare, hah'e, and ren^^ove the cores; drop into cold water as you pare, to prevent 
turning black. Put a little over one quart of granulated sugar into your pre- 
serving-kettles; add just water enougli to moisten the sugar; when warm, put 
into this two quarts of pears; let them cook very slowly several hours; when 
the syrup is thick, dip the preserves into glass cans, and seal. 
Emma Morrison, Winchester, Indiana. 

PINEAPPLE PRESERVES. 

Pare and slice tlie apples; then weigh them, and to every pound of fruit use 
one pound of sugar; put a layer of the slices into a jar, and cover them with a 
layer of sugar; and thus proceed until the apples and sugar are used up; let 
them stand over night; then take the apples out of the syrup, cook the syrup 
until it thickens, replace the apples, and boil fifteen minutes; take the apples 
out of the syrup, and let them cool; then put them into jars, and pour the syrup 
over them. A few pieces of ginger-root boiled in the syrup will improve it. 
Mrs. N. A. P., Ridge way, South Carolina. 

TOMATO PRESERVES. 

Scald and peel carefully small, pear-shaped tomatoes, not too ripe; prick 
with a needle to prevent bursting, and put their weight in sugar over them; 
let them lie over night, then pour off all the juice into a preserve-kettle, and 
boil until it is as thick as syrup, clarifying it with the white of an egg; add the 
tomatoes, and boil until they look transparent. A piece or two of ginger-root or 
one lemon to one pound of fruit, sliced tliin and cooked with the fruit, will 
improve it. 



314 PRESERVES AND JELLIES. 

PRESERVED STRAWBERRIES. 

I*ejiioT(> the bulls from your berries, aud put into a colander a couple of 
quarts only at a time; pour water over to cleanse them; have on the stove a 
pan of syrup n)a(le of two j)ouuds of white sugar and one lialf cupful of water, 
drop the berries into it, allow them to cook rapidly for twenty minutes, remove 
all the scum that rises, but do not stir the fruit; pour into tumblers, and when 
jou are all done, cook your syrup and juice to a jelly, and lill up your glasses; 
let stand until next day, aud tie up Avith thin paper, over which put a cloth. 
Keep in a dry place. 

CANNING STRAWBERRIES. 

Wash the berries thoroughly before picking off the stems, and Aveigh them; 
to each pound of berries alloAV one fourth of a pound of sugar. Let them cook 
fifteen minutes after they come to a boil; then they are ready for the cans. 
Bettie Ferguson, Stockton, Alabama. 

CANNING APPLES AND QUINCES. 

Pare and cut equal quantities of apples and quinces. First cook the quinces 
in sufficient water to cover them until they are tender, then take them out, and 
cook the apples in the same AA'ater; put into a jar or kettle a layer of quinces, 
then of apples until all are used; pour oA'er them a syrup made of one half pound 
of sugar to one pound of quinces, dissolved in a little AA'ater, and let it stand OA'er 
night. The next day heat them thoroughly, aud seal in cans. 
Mrs. A. P. K., St. Charles, Missouri. 

CANNED PLUMS. 

TwelA'e pounds of damsons and three pounds of sugar will fill six quart 
cans, aud the same of pears and peaches. 

CANNED PEACHES. 

Pare the peaches with a sih^er knife, if possible, cut into halves, and lay in 
cold water until ready. Put on the stove one pound of sugar, with one and one 
half quarts of hot water turned over it; let it cook to a sj'rup. Set your jars on 
a cloth in hot Avater; fill your jars with the cold peaches, putting a layer of 
sugar between the peaches; when the jar is full of peaches, fill up AAath the hot 
syrup, and seal immediately. The water the jars set in should come nearly to 
the top. 

CANNED GRAPES. 

Carefully pick from the stems, and Avash the grapes; remove the skins, 
dropping the pulp into one vessel and the skins into another. When all are thus 
prepared, put the pulps into a preserving-kettle over the fire, aud stir con- 
stantly until the seeds come out clean; then press the mass through a colander, 
add the skins to the pulp, weigh them, and to one pound of grapes allow one 
half pound of sugar; boil one and one half hours, and put into glass jars while 
hot, and seal. Thirteen pounds of grapes and six and one half pounds of sugar 
Avill fill six quart cans.

bottle, and seal hot. 

BLACK BEKKY JAM. 

Two quarts of blackberries, one (luart of linely cooked apples and two quarts 
of sugar; boil twenty minutes. 
L. K. E., Lebanon, Oliio. 

KEI) OK BLACK KASPBEKKY JAM. 

To use one third of currants to two thii-ds of raspberries is better than the 
berries alone. JNIash tlie fruit well, and let it boil twenty miniites; weigh the 
quantity; allowing for the weight of the kettle, and to every pound of fruit use 
three fourths of a pound of sugar. After this is put in, let it boil until, by taking 
some out on a plate to try it, no .iuice gathers about it; then it is ready to put 
away, as you would jelly, in glasses; or stone jars are nice. 
Mary McAllister, Meclianicsville, Iowa. 

PLUM AND APPLE JAM. 

After canning phuns there is often some left, not enough to till a can; a very 
nice jam can be made of this by putting it through a sieve, and adding the 
same quantity of good cooked apples; sweeten to taste, and put in a very little 
cinnamon and cloves; cook one hour, then tie up in jars when cold. 

APPLE BUTTEK. 

Three gallons of cooked apples, one quart of cider vinegar and five pounds of 
brown sugar; boil this down to about two gallons, and season with cinnamon.

316 PEESEBVES AND JELLIES. 

CURRANT JELLY. 

Wash, and strip the currants from the stems, and put them into a preserving- 
kettle; mash them as they get hot, and let them boil one lialf hour; then turn 
them into a coarse hair-sieve or jellj'^-bag, and let them drip; Avheu through 
dripping, without squeezing, measure, and pour into the liettle to cook. After 
it has boiled about ten minutes, put in the heated sugar, allowing one pound 
of sugar to one pint of jelly, and the jelly Avill set as soon as the sugar is dis- 
solved—about three quarters of an liour. 
Mary McAllister, Mecbanicsville, Iowa. 

GRAPE JELLY. 

To every eight pounds of fruit take one coffee-cupful of water; put them into 
a porcelain-lined kettle, and boil until quite soft; strain through a cloth strainer; 
measure the juice; measure and set aside an equal quantity of granulated 
sugar; then boil the juice one half hour; add the sugar, and let it boil five or 
eiglit minutes longer. All jellies, to be good, should have nearly all of the 
boiling done before the sugar is added. Fruit that is partially ripe makes the 
prettiest jellies. 

Mis. Thos. Morgan. 

RHUBARB AND APPLE JELLY. 

Cut up your rhubarb, and wash it; put over the fire without any water at 
all; take good sour apples, pare and quarter, and cook in a very little water;

TEA-BALLS. 

These useful articles are made lu different shapes, of plated and also solid 
silver. They are opened, the tea is put inside, then closed, and boiling water 
poured over them into the teacups; the perforations allow the water to reach 




the leaves, making the tea any strength desired without the annoyance of the 
floating leaves. The ring is placed upon the finger, and the ball dipped up and 
down through the water. The tea can be changed when fresh is desired. This 
will also serve for afternoon teas. 

TEA. 

People must consult their own tastes as to the kind of tea. Mixed is the 
best to use with ice. Allow one teaspoonful for each person. Use boiling water, 
but do not boil the tea, and use v/hile fresh. Tea is best made in an earthen 




tea-pot. It should never be made in tin. Iced tea should be made several hours 
before it is needed, and then set upon ice. When ready to use, sweeten, and 
drink without milk or cream. LTse cracked ice to put into the glass. 

TEA. 

Allow one teaspoonful of tea for three cupfuls; pour on nearly one quart of 
boiling water, and set it where it will keep warm, but not cook. Some put a

NUT CANDY. 

Boil together until it "snaps" when dropped into cold water, two oupfuls 
of dark brown maple sugar and one cupful of millv or cream; remove from the 
fire, and stir rapidly until it begins to sugar; add one cupful of chopped shag- 
barks; pour into a buttered tin. 

Mrs. Althea Somes, Teacher of Cookery, Manual Training School, Boston, Mass. 

NUT CANDY. 

Take a well-buttered plate, and spread on it about one half pint of hickory- 
nut kernels; then take one jiint of maple molasses, boil it until it becomes thick, 
and try it by dropping some into cold water; when it hardens in the water, pour 
it over the kernels, and stir up quickly. 
Lewisburg, Ohio. 

COCOANUT CANDY. 

2 teacupfuls of white sugar, 1/2 teacupful of sweet cream, 

Butter tlie size of a walnut. 
Let it boil fifteen minutes; then stir in as much cocoanut as you think best: 
flavor to taste. 

Carrie L., Austin. 

VANILLA SUGAR CANDY. 

2 pounds of granulated sugar, Butler the size of an egg, 

2-3 of a cupful of water, 1 tablespoonful of glycerin, 

1-3 of a cupful of vinegar, 2 tablespoonfuls of vanilla. 

Boil all except vanilla, Avithout stirring, twenty minutes or one half hour, or 
until crisp when dropped into water. Just before pouring upon platters to cool, 
add one small teaspoonful of soda or cream of tartar. After pouring upon 
platters, pour over it the vanilla. This can be pulled beautifully white. Make 
in strips, and cut with shears. 

WHITE-SUGAR CANDY. 
4 pounds of white sugar, 4 tablespoonfuls of cream, 

1 pint of water, 4 tablespoonfuls of vinegar. 

Butter the size of an egg. 

Boil all together sloAvly for about three quarters of an hour. 
Weldon W., Springfield, Ohio. 

UNCOOKED CANDY. 

Into the whites of two eggs stir as much confectioners' XXXX sugar as will 
make the mixture like a soft dough. This is used as a foundation for a great 
many kinds of candy. Put it out on a molding-board, and form into balls, which 
can be dipped into melted chocolate, and made into chocolate creams. A piece 
put between a split date, with the seed removed, and the Avliole rolled in either 
pinlv or Avhite granulated sugar, forms another. A piece put between two half 
kernels of English walnut makes another. Chopped nuts mixed in the dough, 
and then cut into squares, forms another. Putting a little red sugar in the 
mixture as you stir it makes a lovely pink color, which you can arrange in layers 
between the white, and cut into squares. Tliese are only a few of its uses. Use 
any flavoring extract desired, but in very small drop quantities. '

water to keep it from sticking. When wanted for eating, turn the pan bottom 
side up, knock on it, and the candy will come out without any trouble. 

Lizzie Mast, Springfield, Ohio. 




Chapter XX. 

A majority of tin- ailments of tlie liiiman race are caused by a "disordered 
stomacli," and tlie greatest danger to our system is the uon-assimilation of 
food. In a good many cases this has been caused through injudicious food, 
or by food partaken of in too great a hurry. "Peptonized diet" is the only 
remedy. The food must reach the stomach in a prepared state, and will be 
readily absorbed by the system and strengthen the debilitated organs so that 
they will be able again to perform their duties. In cases of convalescence and 
consumption this treatment will be of great value. We will make a few sug- 
gestions for these preparations. 



BROTH, QUICKLY MADE. 

Take a bone or two of a neck or loin of mutton, and take off the fat and 
skin, set it over the fire in a small tin saucepan that has a cover, with three 
fourths of a pint of water, the meat being first beaten and cut into thin bits; 
put in a bit of thyme and parsley, and if approved, a slice of onion. Let it boil 
very quickly, skim it nicely; take off the cover if likely to be too weak, else 
cover it. Half an hour Is sufficient for the whole process.

CLEAR BROTH. 

The following is a clear brotli tliat will lieep long: I'ut. the rouiicl of beef, 
a knuckle-bone of veal and a few shanks of mutton into a deep pan, and cover 
closely with a dish or coarse crust; bake until the beef is done enough for 
eating, with only as much water as Avill cover. When cold, cover it closely in 
a cocl place. When to be used, give what flavor may be approved. 

CHICKEN BROTH. 

Put the body and legs of the fowl of Avhich chicken panada was made, after 
taking off the skin and rump, into the water in which it was boiled, with a blade 
of mace, one slice of onion and ten peppercorns. Simmer until the broth be of a 
pleasant flavor; if there is not water enough, add a little. Beat fine one fourth 
of an ounce of sweet almonds, witli a teaspoonful of water, boil it in the broth, 
strain, and when cold, remove the fat. 

VEAL EROTH. 

Put the knuckle of a leg or shoulder of veal with very little meat to it, an 
old fowl and four shank-bones of mutton extremely well soaked and bruised, 
three blades of mace, ten peppercorns, an onion, a large bit of bread and three 
quarts of water into a stew-pot that covers closely, and simmer in the slowest 
manner after it has boiled up and been slvimmed; or bake it; strain, and take 
off the fat; salt as wanted. It will require four hours. , 

YEAL BROTH FOR INVALIDS. 

Cut two pounds of lean veal into small pieces; sprinkle a little salt upon 
these, and put them into a saucepan with one quart of cold water. Let the 
liquor boil, skim carefully, then simmer as gently as possible. Strain it, let it 
get cold, and remove the fat from the surface; thicken with a little arrow- 
root before serving. Time to simmer the veal, three hours. 

WHITE BROTHS, WITH VERMICELLI. 

Light and delicate white broths maj^ be produced by stirring the yolks of 
two or three fresh eggs with tAvo tablespoonfuls of cold water, which must 
then be poured into the hot broth, gently stirring it all the time, without allow- 
ing the broth to boil after the eggs are put in, or they will be curdled. 

PEPTONIZED BROTH. 

Take one quart of consomme (as stated under "Consomme"), boil it down to 
one pint, and when nearly cool, add two tablespoonfuls of essence of pepsin; 
put on the ice at once. Ready for use as soon as cold. 

Eugene Stnyvesant Howard, Member of tlie Univprsal Cookery and Food Association, 
London, England, and Cbef de Cuisine, Louisville Hotel. 

WATER GRUEL. ' 

Rub smooth a large spoonful of oatmeal with two of water, and pour it 
into one pint of water boiling on the fire; stir it well, and boil quickly, but take 
care that it does not boil over. In a quarter of an liour strain it off, and add 
salt and a bit of butter when eaten. Stir until the butter be incorporated. 



INVALID CUUKEKV. 327 

SA(U) (JIIUEL. 

Take tAVO tablespooiifuls of saso, and place thorn in a small saucepan; 
moisten !>radually with a little cold water; set the preparation over a slow lire, 
and keep stirring until it becomes rather stiff and clear; add a little grated 
nutmeg and sugar to taste; if pi-eferred, half a pat of butter may also be added 
with the sugar. 

INVALIDS" sour. 

Split a falf's foot, and cut one pound of good, lean, juicy beef and one 
pound of lean mutton into small ])ieces; put them, together with one half gallon 
of water, into an earthenware jar, and bake in a slow oven for from si.x: to seven 
hours, adding another quart of water, a small teaspoonful of whole allspice 
and a leaf or two of sage Avhen the mixture has been stewing tliree or four 
hours. When the soup is reduced to half tlie quantity, strain through a sieve, 
and when cold and a jelly, remove the fat. This soup may be taken cold, or 
Avarmed up with a little vermicelli, and pepper and salt to taste. Sufficient for 
three pints. 

BEEF TEA. 

Cut into small pieces t^AO pounds of fresh, lean beef; add three pints of cold 
water; when on the eve of boiling, carefully remove the scum; the moment it 
boils add one pint of cold water; then let it boil up again, and remove the scum 
as before. If by this time it is not perfectly clear, the same quantity of water 
may be added the second time, Avhich Avill cause more scum to rise. The same 
remarks apply to all other broths and gravies, Avhich will always be trans- 
parent and finely flavored if the same rule be observed. Beef tea should be 
allowed to simmer not less than three quarters of an hour, and not more than 
one hour from the time it is last skimmed. 

CHICKEN TANADA. 

Take the breast of a cold chicken, and pound it in a mortar to a very fine 

paste, then put it into a very small stew-pan, and add to it, gradually, as much 

boiling-hot broth as will make it of the required consistency; season with a little 

salt ; place the stew-pan over the fire, stir the contents, but do not let them boil. 

TOAST AND WATER. 

Toast slowly a thin piece of bread until extremely brown and hard, but not 
the least black; then plunge it into a jugful of cold water, and cover it over an 
bouV before using. It should be of a fine brown color before drinking it. 

ArPLE-WATER. 

Cut two large apples into slices, and pour a quart of boiling water on them, 
or on roasted apples; strain in two or three hours, and sweeten slightly. 

BARLEY-WATER. 

Wash a laandful of common barley, tlien simmer it gently in three pints of 
water with a bit of lemon-iK>el. 



t^i 



INVALiD COOKERY; 



INVALIDS' LEMONADE; 



Put about half of a slicod lemon, pared and divested of the inner Skin; oi' 
pith, with the parings and an ounce or tAvo of lump-sugar, into a jug; poui' 
boiling water over these ingredients, and cover closely. In two hours strain for 
use. To the above quantity of lemon add one pint of water, wliich will malve 
a refreshing lemonade. 

ORANGEADE. 

Take the thin peel of two oranges and of one lemon; add the water and 
sugar the same as for lemonade; when cold, add the juice of one lemon and of 
four or five oranges, and strain off. 

FLAXSEED LEMONADE. 

Four tablespoonfuls of whole flaxseed, one quart of boiling water poured 
on the flaxseed, and the juice of two lemons, leaving out the peel; sweeten to 
taste; steep three hours in a covered pitcher. If too thick, put in cold water, 
with the lemon-juice and sugar. Ice for drinking. It is splendid for colds. 

TAPIOCA JELLY. 

Choose the largest sort, pour cold water on to wash it two or three times, 
then soak it in fresh water five or six hours, and simmer it in the same until 
it becomes quite clear; then put lemon-juice and sugar in. The peel should 
have been boiled in it. It thickens very much. 

MULLED JELIiY. 

Take one tablespoonful of currant or grape jelly; beat with it the white of 
one egg and a little loaf-sugar; pour on it one half pint of boiling Avater, and 
break in a slice of dry toast or two crackers. 

CALVES'-FEET JELLY. 

Boil two calves' feet in four quarts of water for five hours, then strain the 
liquor through a hair-sieve, and the next day take off all the fat. Whisk the 
whites and shells of three eggs in a stew-pan, then put in the jelly, and add a 
small piece of cinnamon, the thin peel of two lemons and the juice of three, 
with about six or seven ounces of loaf-sugar; put the steAv-pan over a brisk fire, 
and whisk its contents until on the eve of boiling, then remove the stew-pan, 
cover it closely, and let it remain near the fire for fifteen minutes, taking care 
not to allow the jelly to boil. Pass it through the bag in the usual way. 

INVALIDS' CUTLET. 

Get a cutlet from the loin or neclt of well-fed mutton, but cut away all the 
fat, and leave nothing but the lean, which put into a stew-pan with just enough 
water to cover it, and a very little salt; stew gently, and add a small quantity 
of celery cut into thin shavings. Carefully skim off any fat that may appear 
on the top, and when it has stewed about two hours, without boiling, the meat 
will be easy of digestion. Add pepper and salt to taste. Time to stew celery, 
thirty to thirty-five minutes. 



INVALID COOKERY. 329 

AliKOWROOT rUDDING. 

Take one tablospoonful of arrowroot and one half pint of milk, one table- 
spoonful of which add cold to the arrowroot, stirring it until it is well mixed, 
then boil the remainder of the half pint of milk, sweeten to taste with loaf- 
sugar, and Avhile it is boiling hot, add it by degrees to the arrowroot, then boil 
the whole, stirring it all tlie time, until it becomes thickened, and have readj 
the yolks and Avhites of six eggs beaten together, which stir into it. Put all 
into a buttered basin, and cover with paper; then steam it for one half hour. 
A padding may be made in the same way, baked in a dish with a liglit crust 
around, and flavored with any approved ingredient. 

MINCED CHICKEN. 

Take the breast of a cold roasted chicken, and mince it finely; add one half 
teaspoonful of fine flour, together with five or six tablespoonfnls of broth; 
season with a pinch of salt. If broth is not at hand, substitute new milk. 

SCRAPED BEEF. 

Take a good piece of raw steak, lay it on a meat-board, and with a knife 
scrape into fine bits: after removing all hard and gristly parts, put it into a 
pan over the fire, and let it remain just long enough to become thoroughly 
heated through, stirring it up from the bottom occasionally. Season with a 
little salt. This is very nutritious and quite palatable. As a food for infants 
this is unsurpassed. It should be fed raw — in quantities of one half teaspoon- 
ful at a time. This, in connection Avith cod-liver oil as a tonic, will build up a 
child in delicate health who is unable to retain milk in any form. It should be 
freslily prepared whenever used. 

DRIED FLOUR FOR INFANTS. 

Take one teacupful of flour, tie it up tightly in a close m'uslin bag, put it 
into a pot of cold water, and let boil tliree hours; then take it out, and dry the 
outside. When used, remove the outer skin, and grate it. One tablespoouful 
is enougli for one teacupful of milk (which would be better with a little water); 
wet the flour with a little cold Avater, and stir into the milk; add a very little 
salt, and boil five minutes. This is a good food for a child suffering with 
summer complaint or any kind of loose bowels. 

FLOUR CAUDLE. 

Into five large spoonfuls of water rub smooth one dessei't-spoonful of fine 
flour; set over the fire five spoonfuls of new milk, and put two bits of sugar into 
it; the moment it boils, pour into it the flour and water, and stir it over a slow 
fire twenty minutes. It is a nourishing and gently astringent food. This is 
an excellent food for babies who have weak bowels. 

WHEY. 

That of cheese is a very wholesome drink, especially when the cows are fresh 
in herbage. 



330 INVALID COOKERY. 

JUNKET. 

Take one tumblerful of sweet milk (not cold), add enough sugar to suit the 
taste, a few drops of essence of vanilla and one tablespoonful of essence of 
pepsin; mix well, and let it remain in a Avarm place until it commences to thicken, 
then put on ice, and serve Avhen thorough Ij' cold. 

PEPTONIZED MILK. 

Take one imported quart bottle (champagne), clean it thoroughly, mix two 
tubes of pepsin in one fourth of a teacupful of water, put it into the bottle, 
and fill tlie same three fourths full, shake well, cork, and fasten the cork well. 
Have a pailful of hot watei"— hot enough to bear your hand in — ready, put the 
bottle into it. The water should be as high on the outside of the bottle as the 
milk on the inside. Let it remain there for fifteen minutes; then put the bottle 
on the ice at once. When cold, it is ready for use. It is advisable to take small 
doses very often. • 

OPtGEAT. 

Beat two ounces of almonds, with one teaspoonful of orange-flower water 
and a bitter almond or two; then pour one quart of milk and water into the 
paste. Sweeten with sugar. 

SIPPETS. 

On an extremely hot plate put two or three sippets of bread, and pour over 
them some gravy from beef, mutton or veal, if there is no butter in the dish. 
Sprinkle a little salt over it. 







Chapter XXI. 



BY CHRISTIE IRVING. 



All good housekeepers know the advantage to be derived from a "good 
start" in the morning. To insure this, make all preparations for breakfast the 
evening before. Give especial attention to your matcli-box, kindling-basket and 
coal-receiver; and if all things are ready, it will take but a short time to have 
breakfast ready. 

Never use the first water that comes froni a pump or hydrant; it has been 
in a lead or iron pipe all night, and is not healthful. 

Much hurry and confusion would be prevented if housekeepers would do 
little tedious jobs during leisure moments. 

Study your cook-book as you would any other lesson— not at the very moment 
you Avish to use it, but some time wlieu you are sitting down for an hour's 
leisure or rest. 

All groceries and household supplies should be put away in their own proper 
receptacles, and not left standing around in paper bags. Keep rice, oatmeal, 
cracked wheat, tapioca, etc., in closely covered glass jars, tea and coffee in tin 
canisters, meal and flour in covered wooden buckets. 

Never set coal-oil near butter or lard. 

If corn-meal is bought by the quantity, it should be spread out up®n an old 

sheet in a room where the air passes, and thoroughly dried before putting it 

away, to keep it from getting musty. 

331 



S32 Practical SUGfiESTiONS fo young housekeepers. 

When you buy raisins for cooliing purposes, seed them, wash, and thoroughly 
dry thorn, and put into glass jars with tight lids; currants also. If you prefer, 
you can buy the seedless raisins, but they are a little more expensive. 

During the oyster season always have rolled cracliers ready. You can save 
the crushed crackers and crumbs from your cracliers in a glass jar, and so 
avoid using your whole ones. 

It is best to buy hominy, beans, rice, etc., in quantities. 

Five or six quarts of biscuit-flour can be prepared at a time by taking one 
teaspoonful of soda and tAvo of cream of tartar, or three of baking-powder, to 
every quart of flour, sifting it thoroughly three times, and put away for use. 

Burn all egg-shells, coffee-grounds, sweepings, etc. 

If you keep chickens, cook all your vegetable parings, and feed them; if not, 
burn them. 

Never throw tin cans into the alley or street. Wash them, and set aside for 
use. They will often be handy. 

Never set aside a bottle dirty. Wash clean, and turn with the neck down, 
that it may dry, and no dust be in it when you want it. 

Never wrap steel or silver in a woolen cloth; use soft tissue-paper. 

Never let any kind of food remain in copper or brass vessels after it is 
cooked. 

Never wash your rolling-pin. Scrape off the dough that adheres, and wipe 
with a dry towel. 

In cleaning any vessel in which strong-smelling vegetables have been cooked, 
use half a teaspoonful of soda in a little hot water, washing it well afterward 
in hot soap-suds. 

A brass kettle can be cleaned, if discolored by cooking in it, by scouring it 
well with soap and ashes first, then put in half a pint of vinegar and a handful 
of salt, and let them boil on the stove a short time; then wash, and rinse it out 
in hot water. 

Never use a metal spoon for stirring stew^ed fruit or tomatoes. A wooden 
one is best, and those with short handles are preferable for stirring tliick 
messes. 

Never let the handles of knives be put into hot water. If possible, buy silver 
knives when you begin your housekeeping. You will not find it an extravagance 
in the end. 

Never allow your carving-knife to be used to cut bread; provide a separate 
knife. 

Never throw water on burning oil; use flour. 

If your clothes take fire, do not run about, but lie doAvn, and roll over and 
over until the flame is smothered. 

Never buy sweet potatoes in large quantities. 

Always keep a stick wrapped with old muslin to grease hot pans and all 
baking-tins. 

Always put your griddle-cake batter into a pitcher, and pour it out to bake. 

Old bleached muslin is ®f no use except for carpet-rags. They will not do 
for dusters, as they will not hold dust, nor for cleaning, as they will not absorb 
moisture, while old unbleached stuff; does nicely. 

For dish-towels some use crash, Avhich should be of the very best quality, 



PRACTICAL SUGGESTIONS TO YOUNG HOUSEKEEPERS. 333 

though old drilliug or a poor quality of titkius makes better ones; and many 
ladies prefer a light-weight uubleaehed muslin, as a cotton cloth does not 
leave the lint that liuen does Avhen a little worn. ' 

For dish-rags buy white mosquito-netting— a quarter of a yai'd is sufficient 
for one — which should be folded back and forth as many times as the width 
will allow, and tack as a eomfoit. Some make them of a ball of candle-wick, 
knit on two wooden needles the size of a lead-pencil. Set up twenty stitches. 
Knit in plain garter knitting until the ball is used up. These are easily kept 
clean if washed in hot soap-suds after each meal; also wash tlie dish-towels at 
the same time. A half dozen ai"e quite sufficient. 

Provide also several soft holders to use in talcing up liot dishes; these should 
be made six inches by eight, slightly caught through and a brass ring in one 
corner to hang upon a nail close to the stove. Old stockings are good for this, 
or two thicknesses of pants cloth. 

Evi'ry housekeeper should provide herself with little conveniences for doing 
her work. A short-handled, broad paint-brush to wash the outside of window- 
sills, and an old tooth-brush for washing around the glass. 

Begin housekeeping on the cash basis. If you cannot pay cash for an article, 
do not get it. 

Among the first tilings yon learn to do, let it be your own marketing. 

Every wife should have a certain weekly allowance to use for household 
expenses. 

Have a flour-sack in which to put all clippings from sewing, all waste paper, 
etc., which save to dispose of to the ragman for articles you need. 

Save yourself steps by having a broom, dust-pan and dusters up-stairs to do 
the chamber work. 

Have all new steel knives well sharpened, also chopping-knives; use these 
only in the kitchen. Time is saved by using silver-plated ones on the dining- 
table. 

A rubber window-cleaner is a very convenient article to have; also a hair- 
brush for outside cleaning. 

.Tellj'-bags are made of flannel. 

If possible, have your kitchen table made to order, with an ash top and three 
deep drawers— two in partitions. 

Ticking makes the nicest kitchen aprons. Some prefer ginghams or denim. 
Large, plain white ones, to reach to the bottom of the dress, should always be 
ready to put on when going to the table, or to tie quickly over the other if 
called to the door. 

If ladyfingers are wanted, get special tins to bake them the proper shape. 

Bread-crusts should be dried in the oven, and put away in paper bags until 
wanted for use. 

India-rubber gloves are used by many ladies for washing dishes, as the hot, 
soapy water is very injurious to some skins, also causing some finger-nails to 
split and get sore. These would seem an extravagance at first, but are not if 
looked upon as a preservative for the hands; and it is right to take as good 
care of one's self in every way possible. 

After washing the hands, dip them in weak vinegar-water before wiping 
them. This will keep them nice, and often prevent chapping. 



834 PRACTICAL SL^GGBSTIOlfS TO YOUNG HOtTSEKEEPERS. 

The best china aud ghxss are the c-heapest, even for every-day use, if the 
outlay can be afforded, as they are annealed before leaving the manufacturers' 
hands, and may be washed in 'boiling water without injury,, and do not crack 
and chip from usage like the common ware. China and glass should be gently 
washed in hot water Avith a little soap, rinsed in cold water, aud carefully 
Wiped with a clean, soft towel. All articles with gilding must be handled with 
great care, never rubbed or polished if the gilding becomes tarnished; chamois- 
skin, with a little whiting on it, may be used to polish it. 

When warming plates and dishes for meats, extreme caution must be used 
to prevent them getting hot, as heat cracks the glazing, and if it does not show 
at the time, it will soon crack or break. 

Cut glass will not look clear unless washed in very hot water, but does not 
require soap. If it is in any way blurred or tarnished, it must be cleaned with 
a soft brush dipped in whiting, and then polished Avith a soft piece of news- 
paper; this gives it a brilliant, clear appearance, and no lint remains as when 
rubbed with a linen towel.

The following suggestions may not be out of place concerning the treatment 
of new coolving-uteusils: 

Iron pots should always be boiled out first with wood ashes and cold water, 
then thoroughly washed, and they are ready for use. Skillets, griddles, iron 
gem-pans and waffle-irons should be well greased, and allowed to burn otf once 
or twice before using. 

Sheet-iron pans for cake and bread are preferable to tin. 

Earthen and stone Avare jars or crocks should be filled with cold water, and 
put over a slow fire, and allowed to come to a boil once or twice before using 
to cook in. 

In washing greasy skillets, the addition of a little soda to the first water will 
neutralize the grease and make it much easier to clean. These are best cleaned 
when hot. 

Always keep the inside of your coffee-pot bright to insure good coffee. Boil 
it out occasionally with soap, water and wood ashes and scour thoroughly. 

All bottles and cruets are best cleaned with shot and soap-suds. Save the 
shot in a small bottle to use again. 

Where sand cannot be obtained, bath brick can be used to scrub Avooden 
articles, tables, floors, etc. 

In lime-water localities, keep an oyster-shell in your tea-kettle to receive the 
lime deposits, or egg-shells. 

Have a folding rack to screw against a window-frame or near the stove to 
dry the dish-towels on. 

A small folding table to use as a side-table is a great convenience when 
your family is larger than common.

NAPERY. 



Dinner napkins slioukl be about twenty-eight inches broad and thirty inches 
long. They may be folded in a variety of ways, which impart a style to a table 
Avithout adding much to the expense, and may be readily accomplished with a 
little practice and attention to the following directions and diagrams: 

THE EXQUISITE.— Fig. 1. 

Fold the napkin into three parts longways, then fold down two fifths of the 
length from each side as in Fig. 2 at a; roll up the part b toward the back, 





Fig. 2. 

repeat on the other side, then turn up the corner toward the corner a, and it 
will appear as d. The center part, e, is now to be turned up at the bottom and 
down at the top, and the two rolls brought under the center piece, as in Fig. 
1. The bread is placed under the center band, k, Fig. 1. 

THE CINDERELLA.— Fig. 3.

and G from behind, when they Avill appear as in Fig. 7. Bend the corner ir 
toward the right, and tuck it behind i, and turn back the corner k toward the

bread is placed under the miter, or in the center at the top. 



THE FIJRT.-FiG. 8. 

P^'old the napkin into three parts longways, then fold 
across the breadth, commencing at one extremity and

The art of carving is a very requisite branch of domestic mauagement. It 
not only belongs to the honors of the table, but it is important from an economical 
point of view, for a ham or a fowl or a joint of meat ill carved will not serve so 
many persons as it would if it were properly carved. And it does seem to me 
that the most careless and commonplace person can at once discern the differ- 
ence in the taste (to say nothing of the looks) of a fowl that is well carved and 
one that is awkwardly handled. 

Ladies ought especially to make carving a study. In their own homes they 
grace the table, and should be enabled to perform the task allotted them with 
sufficient skill to prevent remark or the calling forth of eager proffers of assis- 
tance from good-natured visitors, who probably would be mortified by a com- 
plete failure. It is true that ihe mode adopted of not sending meats, etc., to the 
table, but having them served on a side-table by servants, is rapidly banishing 
the necessity for promiscuous carding from the elegantly served boards of the 
wealthy; but in the homes of the less wealthy, where the refinements of cookery 
are not adopted, the utility of skill in the use of a carving-knife is sufficiently 
obvious. 

In the first place, whatever is to be carved should be set in a dish sufficiently 

large for turning it if necessary; but the dish itself should not be moved from 

its position, which should be close before t4ie carver, only leaving room for the 

plates. The carving-knife should be light, sharp, well tempered and of a size 

proportioned to the joint, strength being less required than address in the 

349

SUGGESTIONS ON CARVING. 



manner of using it. Large, solid joints, such as ham, fillet of veal and corned 
beef, cannot be cut too thin; but mutton, roast pork and other joints of veal 
should be served in very slender slices. There are certain choice cuts or del- 
icacies with which a good carver is acquainted. In helping fish, silver should 
always be used, and care talven to avoid brealii-ng the flakes, which should be 
kept as entire as possible. Salmon and all short-grained fish should be cut 
lengthwise and not across, portions of the tliick and thin being helped together. 

TO CARVE SIRLOIN OF BEEP. 

A sirloin should be cut with one good, firm strolje from end to end of the 
joint, at the upper portion, malcing the cut very clean and even from A B to C. 
Then disengage it from the bone by a horizontal cut exactly to the bone, B to 
D, using the tip of the knife. Bad carving bears the hand away to the rind of 




the beef eventually after many cuts, peeling it back to tlie other side, leaving a 
portion of the best of the meat adhering to the bone. Every slice should be 
clean and even, and the sirloin should be cut fairly to the very end. Many 
persons cut the under side while hot, not reckoning it so good cold; but this is a 
matter of taste, and so is the mode of carving it. The best way is, first of all, 
to remove the fat, E, which chops up well to make puddings, if not eaten at the 
table. Tlien the under part can be cut, as .already described, from end to end, 
F to G, or downAvard, as shown by tlie marks at H. 



BONING TURKEY. 

Boning poultry is a difficult business for the inexperienced, and, generally 
speaking, is best left to the poulterer. Written instructions for its accomplish- 
ment are almost valueless, and the knowledge gained from them is worth very 
little compared to that which may be derived from once watching an experi- 
enced cook perform the operation. Turkeys are usually boned without the skin 
being cut up the back. To do this, the joints are loosened inside the bird, the 
fiesh raised with a short, sharp-pointed knife, and the bones drawn out grad- 
ually, the flesh being laid baclv until the body is turned inside out, when the 
boning may be easily finished, Wheu a turkej^ has been boned, the legs an4 



SUGGESTIONS ON CARVING. 



351 



wlugs are souerally drawn into the body of the bird, and care must be taken to 
simmer, and then to cool tlie bird very gently for fear the skin should burst. 

CARVING OF TURKEY. 

The breast of a turkey is so large that slices taken neatly from it and from 
the wings generally suttice for all the company. They should be taken from 




each side alternately, beginning close to tlie wings; and a little forcemeat and a 
small portion of liver ought to be served to each guest. When it is necessary 
for the legs to be used, they should be separated from the body with a sharp 
knife, and cut into slices, but it should be remembered that they, with the 
gizzard, will make an excellent devil. 

TO CARVE HAUNCH OF VENISON. 

In carving a haunch of venison, first cut it across doAvn to the bone in the 
line A B; then turn the dish with the knuckle farthest from you, put in the point 
of the knife, and cut down as deep as you can in the direction shown by the 




dotted lines. You may take out as many slices as you please on the right and 
left. The knife should slope in making the first cut, and then the whole of the 
gravy will be I'eeeived in the well. It is held by genuine epicures that, some 
parts of the haunch are better flavored than others, but it is doubtful whether 
ordinary palates will detect any difference. Slices of venison should not be cut 
thick, and plenty of gravy should be given Avith them. The fat is very apt to 
get cool soon, and become hard and disagreeable to the palate; it should, there- 
fore, always be served upon a water-dish.

SUGGESTIONS OK CARYlNG. 



STEAK. 

Steak is cut into thin slices, the tenderloin being served first, the other part 
after that is finished. Veal cutlet is usually cut up into small pieces before 
being cooked; if not tender, it should be cut into pieces by the carver, and 
served with gravy or sauce. 

TO CARVE LEG OF ROAST PORK. 

In carving either the roast leg or loin of pork, the knife must follow the direc- 
tion of the lines scored by the cook before the meat was roasted, on the skin 




which forms the crackling. This skin is too crisp to be conveniently cut through. 
It usually happens that the lines scored on the roasted leg of porlv are placed 
too far apart for single cuts. In order, therefore, to cut thin slices from the 




meat, raise up the craclding. The seasoning should be placed under the skin 
around the shank-bone. Often, however, sage and onion are sent to the table 
separate from the joint. 

TO CARVE CALF'S HEAD. 

Commence by making long slices from end to end of the cheek, cutting quite 
through to the bone, according to the dotted lines from A to B. With each of 
these slices serve a cut of what is called the throat-sweetbread, which lies at 
the fleshy part of the neck-end. Cut also slices from G to D (they are gel- 
atinous and delicate), and serve small pieces with the meat. A little of the 
tongue and a spoonful of the brains are usually placed on each plate. The 



SUGGESTIONS ON CARVING, 353 

tongue is served on a separate plate, surrounded by the brains, and is cut across 
in ratlier tliin slices. Some persons prefer the eye. It is removed by a circular 
cut marked by dotted lines at E. First piit the Icnife in slanting at F, inserting 
llie point at the part of tlie dotted line, and driving it into the center under tlio 
eye; tlien turn the hand around, Iveeping the circle of tlie dotted line with blade 
of tlie knife, the point still in the center. The eye will come out entire, cone- 



shaped at the under part, when the circle is completed by the knife. The lower 
jaw must next be removed, beginning at C; and to do this properly the dish 
must be turned. The palate is also considered a dainty, and a little of it should 
always be offered to each guest. 

HAM. 
Ham, if whole, should be cut through to the bone upon the upper side m thin 




slices. It is by many thought to be a more economical way of cooking it than in 



a piece.

TO CARVE BOILED RABBIT. 

First separate the legs and shoulders; then cut the back across into two 
parts. This may readily be accomplished by inserting the linife in the joint, 
and raising up the back with the fork. As in the case of the hare, the back of 




the rabbit is best worth eating. Some liver sauce should always be served with 

boiled rabbit. 

CARVING OP TONGUE. 

Begin to take slices, not too thin, ftom the middle of the tongue, and after- 
ward cut slices from each side, being careful not to cut quite through the 
tongue. The extreme tip is usually left and used for grating. A little of the 
fat should be put upon each plate. When the tongue is rolled, it should be cut 
into very thin slices horizontally. 

TO CARVE ROAST PARTRIDGE. 

The partridge is cut up in the same way as a foAvl. The prime parts of a 
partridge are the wings, breast and merry-thought. When the bird is small, 




the two latter are not often divided. The Aving is considered the best, and the 
tip of it considered the most delicate morsel of the whole.

LAUNDRY-WORK. 



In these days of so many washing helps of every variety, the old way of 
good soap, rain-water and elbow grease is fast disappearing. 

Washing-day need not be such a terror to the housekeeper if managed right. 
I found it to be less of a bugbear wheu I got my maid to coincide Avith me that 
Tuesday was the best day to have for washing-day. Then there was no sorting 
of clothes on Sunday night, nor was the larder completely depleted, as it Avas 
over Sunday AAath tlie old arrangement. So Ave took Monday for general clean- 
ing and SAveepiug, ate up the left-oA'ers and made a little preparation for 
Tuesday's meals, so as not to go through the ordeal of a Avash-day dinner also. 

The clothes should be carefully sorted over first, then Avash, boil, and rinse 
all that need no starch, and put these out to dry. Then give the attention to the 
starched ones. 

Do not take boiling suds to wash your calicos unless you wish them to loolv 
badly in a fcAV AAashings. A poor laundress Avill spoil a forty-cent gingham in 
one Avashing; a good one- will keep it bright until it is Avorn out. It is simply 
impossible to use any of the Avashing-powders on colored clothes Avithout fading 
them. 

Red table-cloths and naplvins lose their fresh, red color soon unless carefully 
handled. They should be soaked for half an hour in cold water, then put 
quickly through a lukcAA^arm suds, rinsed in salt-AA^ater, and hung up imme- 
diately. Unless you have a bright day to dry your woolens, they had better be 
left until the sun shines, or dried over the stove, as nothing shrinlvS flannels as 
hanging too long Avet and being cold. 

Stockings should never be left to soak, but AA^ashed immediately in clean 

Avater, and not in the boiling suds that is left from the other clothes, and Avhich 

alAA'ays has plenty of lint in it. They should be pinned in pairs, and hung up 

by the toes. Woolen hose should not be ironed, but dried nicely, and pulled into 

Bhape, 

356 



LAUNDRY-WOKK. 



357 



Stains in table-liueu can be talven out by pouring boiling water tlu'ougli them 
before they liave been put into tlie boiling suds. Ink spots on white goods, if 
submerged immediately into new mill^, will come out; but if allowed to stand 
until dry, an acid of some kind will have to be used. Citric is recommended by 
some. 




Ironing-board— Open. 

Iron rust can be easily removed by the application of oxalic acid weakened 
with Avater, as it is liable to eat the goods. This cannot be used upon any kind 
of colored fabric without removing the color. 
Some use chlorid of lime to whiten their 
clothes, but it must be used Avith great care. 

To starch dark-colored clothes, mix your 
starch with coffee liquid, and starch them on 
the wrong side. 

SPRINKLING. 
When the clothes are dry, pull them into 
shape, and fold so that you need only iron the 
ends. Table-linen should l)e very damp, and 
folded the length of the cloth first. The irons 
should be very hot, and it should be ironed 
very dry, so as to give it a gloss. It should 
then be hung in the sunshine or by the fire to 
finish. The towels, should be dampened and 
well shaken, and folded all one way. Sprin- 
kling and folding will often save ironing. 
Thin things, like handkerchiefs, can be laid 
between damp things, and will iron better for 
not being sprinkled. Starched clothes should 
be quite wet, and should be shaped as they 
are folded down. These may be left until 
some of the rougher things are ironed. , 

IRONING. 
If you do all of your own housework, you will not find much time to iron in 
the morning. Have a well-covertnl board, good holders, and a waxed cloth to 
nib off your iuons, or some salt upon a paper. The irons that have wooden

as it is practice that malies perfect, in this as well as many other things. All 
irons retain their heat better after darlv, and it is much better to work with 
them then than in the daytime. They should be Avashed occasionally and Avell

dried, and rubbed with lard to keep them from rust, and they should never set

pull the article straight, and move the iron in the same direction -as the weaving

of *he cloth. Iron embroitleries on the wrong side, upon a thick piece of flannel. 
Pass the iron over lace only enough to dry it, then with the tiujiers pull it into 
shape. Experience is the main thing in all laundry-work, and it can only be 
obtained by practice. 

STARCH. 

This should be well mixed with cold water in the pan in which you intend to 
cook it, boiling water turned upon it, and stirred to keep it from lumping. I put 
into my starch only one teaspoouful of white sugar. I find that salt is affected 
by the atmosphere, and makes the clothes limpy; then I also use a preparation 
made of etpial parts of Avhite Avax and paratliu melted together, and poured 
into a mold, of which I take a piece the size of a filbert to every pan of starch; 
this gives a nice gloss to the linen, and makes the ironing of it much easier. 

Housekeeping in all its details is a wide subject, and many of us must take 
the best part of a lifetime to learn it. It is best to learn it gradually, and not be 
discouraged if it is not all accomplished in a year. There are always new ways 
coming up, and it is a good plan to take up with some of them. We give cuts of 
a good ironing-board, and also a convenient clothes-line and clothes-hoist. 

A is a pulley fastened under the porch, B is a pulley fastened to a high 
post or on top of the barn, C is a double rope. Commencing at A and working 
the ,line toward B, you can hang up that many clothes without getting off youi 
porch. A great saving to going through snow or wet grass. Those using them 
would not l)e without them.

Avater in which one half pound of sugar of lead has been dissolved; dissolve one 
half pound of bichromate of potash in enough water to take it up, then dip the 
material into it. It will color a beautiful orange by dipping it into boiling, air- 
slaked lime-water; then rinse in clear water. To color green, dip the yellow 
goods into a solution made with two boxes of indigo-blue, dissolved in one and 
one half pails of water. — D. A. H., Vernon Center, Minnesota. 

To Make Extract of Lemon.— Pare or grate off the yellow rind of the lemon. 
It is the yellow rind that contains the essential oil of the fruit. Be very care- 
ful to avoid the white underlying skin, which is very bitter, and would spoil the 
delicacy of the flavor. Put the grated rind into a bottle, and cover it with 
alcohol or with simple syrup, or both in equal parts; then cork the bottle, and 
let it stand for three weeks, after which it is ready for use. If you wish it very 
strong, pour the same liquor over fresh peel, and let it stand three weeks longer. 
— F. C. White, Georgiana, Florida. 

Washing Preparation.— Three pounds of bar-soap, two pounds of sal-soda, 
one and one third pounds of borax. Dissolve the soda and borax in three quarts 
of warm Avater, and the soap in scA^en quarts, Avithout boiling; Avhen all are 
dissolved, put together, pour into a tub; when cold, cut into pieces, and put into 
a. box. When ready to wasli, put into the boiler the necessary amount of Avater, 
and into this put a teacupful of the preparation; let it get scalding hot, then pour 
over the soiled clothes, and let them stand one half hour before rubbing.— Mrs. 
Emma Eggleston, Mount Riga, New York. 

Vinegar. — To make six gallons, take six pints of shelled corn, and pour on 
cold AA^ater enough to alloAv the corn to swell. Let it boil until the strength is 
extracted. Strain this into the jar or keg, and fill it up Avith water, hard or soft, 
to make six gallons in all. Add six teacupfuls of brown sugar, tAvo teacupfuls 
of ]nolasses, and a piece of the mother of vinegar. Tie a thin piece of muslin 
over the top, and set in a moderately warm place. In a feAA' weeks it will be 
excellent viuegai-. When more is needed, leave a quart in the jar, and it will 
make quiclvev. — Mrs. M. J. S., Cannon Falls, Minnesota. 

Washing Scarlet Flannel.— A handful of flour mixed AAith a quart of cold 
Avater and boiled for ten minutes. Add it to the Avater you haA'e ready to wash 
in. The articles AAill require many rinsings in clean water after being washed 
in this mixture; but if carefully done, the most brilliant scarlet Avill lose none of 
its brightness. If flannel is soaked in pure, cold Avater before making it up, it 
never shrinks at all. Get a washing-trough filled from the pump, and in this 
the flannel is placed. As soon as it sinks to the bottom it is taken out, and hung 
up without any squeezing. It drains itself, and does not lose the appearance of 
neAv flannel AA^hen dry. 

Washing Compound.— Tavo and one half pounds of sal-soda, one half pound 
of borax, one fourth of a pound of resin, tAvo ounces of salts of tartar, one ounce 
of liquid ammonia. Dissolve the soda, boi'ax and resin in four quarts of water, 
and let it boil ten minutes. When cold, add salts of tartar and the ammonia, 
with four gallons of water. Keep AA-ell corked. Soak the clothes over night in 
clear Avater. In the morning, Avring them out into a tub. Pour five gallons of 
water, one half pint of the Avashing compound and one half pint of soft soap 
into tlie boiler. When hot, but not boiling, pour it over the clothes, letting them 



fiOUSEHOLl) HINTS AND RECIPES* B65 

stand covered twenty minutes. Then look them over, rub cut the streaks of 
dirt, and put tliem into the boilei', willi the same quantity ot water, soap and 
compound as before mentioned. Let tliem come to a boil, tlien rinse, starch, 
and hang them up to dry.— Mrs. I). A. H., Vernon Center, JNIinnesota. 

REMEAtREU that the wings of turkeys, geese and chickins sliould never be 
thrown away. Many people, especially in the country, keip them to brush off 
the stove or range, but there is nothing better to wash and clean windows. 
Chamois or buckskin is very good, but wings are better, costing nothing; and 
their use is an economy— utilizing lliat which would otherwise have been 
thrown away. They are excellent to clean the lieartli or stove, to dust fur- 
niture, but best of all, to wash windows, because the corners can be easily and 
perfectly cleaned by them, leaving no lint behind, as when cloths are used. 
Use these Aviugs also to spread on paste when papering walls. Tliere is nothing 
dcis that kind of Avork better.— Mrs. Stowe. 

Spirits of Ammonia.— There is no telling Avhat a tiling will do until you try 
it. I knew ammonia diluted in water could restore rusty silks and clean coat- 
collars, but Avlien I got a green spot on the carpet I tried half a dozen things 
liefore I thought of that, and that was just what did the AA'ork effectually. I 
put a teaspoonful into al)out one teacupful of hot water, took a clotli, and Avet 
the spot thoroughly, just rul)bing it sliglilly, and tlie ugly si)ot Avas gone. It is 
splendid for cleaning your silver. It makes things as loright as iieAV Avitliout 
any expenditure of strengtli, and for loolciug-glasses and AviudoAvs it is best of 
all. One day Avheu I was tired and my dish-cloths looked rather gray. I turned 
a fcAV drops of annnonia into the Avater, and rubbed them out, and found it 
acted like a charm; and I shall be sure to do so again some day. I suppose 
liouseAvives have a perfect right to experiment and see Avliat results they can 
produce; and if they are not on as large a scale as the farmers', why, they 
are just as important to us, and may malie our Avork ligliter, and brighter, too. 
NoAV, I do not belie\'e in luxuriating in a good thing all alone, and I do hope all 
the housekeepers Avill send and get a ten-cent bottle of spirits of ammonia and 
commenct^ a series of cliemical experiments and see Avhat they can accomplish 
Avith it. Take the boys' jackets, the girls' dresses, and when you have cleaned 
everything else, put a few drops into some AA-ater, and Avash the little folks' 
hoods. 



Skewers are made use of either as an ornament or as a garnish. They are 
applied alike to removes and entrees, if they be cold or warm, meat or fish. 
Yet it will not prove useless to observe that skewers as a garnisli ouglit only 
to be applied in rare cases; by malcing too frequent use of them their value is 
considerably diminished. 

Garnished skewers should be used only if playing a part agreeing to their 
natural luxury; from the moment they cease to be surrounded by the brilliant 
cortege Avhich constitutes the sumptuous part of a well-served dinner they 
produce no effect. 

The twelve skewers represented in the following pages are all of a different 
character. 

Fig. 1 is composed of different pieces of turnips and carrots, cut with the 
aid of a small knife; the oval and crescent are in turnip, hollowed out in tlie 
center and studded w^th a thin slice of carrot; the vegetables must not be 
boiled, and are scarcely blanched. 

Fig. 2 represents a skewer composed of a truffle and a cockscomb; the 
truttle is boiled with its peel on. The cockscomb must be of a nice white color. 

Fig. 3 represents a skewer composed of a decorated quenelle and two truffles, 
one small, the other large. 

Figs. 4, 5 and 6 represent vegetables imitating vases of various kinds. These 
vases are cut out with the knife, and formed of several pieces, and are gar- 
nished with flowers imitated in vegetables— i-oses, camellias and dahlias— and 
with cloves, peppercorns, etc. Flowers imitated in these materials cannot be 
of perfect likeness, but if managed tastefully they have, notwithstanding, a 
fine effect. 

These six skewers are applicable to hot removes. 

Figs. 7, 8 and 9 represent transparent skewers destined for cold pieces; they 
are formed in tin cases, which are either round, hexagonal or channeled; the 
interior of these ornaments is decorated with details of truffles, very red pickled 
tongue or with very white poultry-fillets. The truffles applicable to transparent 
ornaments may be boiled without being peeled, yet there is no impropriety in 
peeling them, tlie chief point being that they be large, of a nice black color and 
of as round a sliape as possible.

others only by the large prawns or crayfish joined to them in order to dis-

tinguish them; moreover, truffles and mushrooms may be admitted into their 
composition, only the cockscombs being inadmissible. In many cases orna-

ments destined for fish are composed only of large shrimps or prawns; but cray- 
fish are always better joined with truffles or mushrooms, which by their color 
give an agreeable relief to the eye.
