FASnUAB TALK WITH THE RKADER. 



Md " little dinner " partiea, not to refer to 
the mighty mountain of manuals upon 
cookery in general ; but. up to the time of 
the present writing, I have found nothing 
that, to my appreciation, meets the case 
atated by the friend whose plaint heads this 
chaptei. 

My aim has been to write out, for seven 
days of four weeks in each month, a menu 
adapted, in all things, to the average 
American market ; giving meats, fish, vegeta- 
bles, and fruits in their season, and, so far 
as I could do so upon paper, rendering a 
satisfactory account of every pound of meat, 
etc., brought, by my advice, into the kitchen. 
I have taken the liberty accorded me by 
virtue of our long and intimate acquain- 
tMcaship. of inspecting not only the contents 
of your market -basket, but each morning the 
treasures of larder and refrigerator ; of offer- 
ing counsel concerning crumbs, bones, and 
such odds-and-ends as are held in contempt 
by many otherwise thrifty managers— *.o wit, 
other cold vegetables than potatoes, and dry 
crusts of bread and cake, while of gravy and 
dripping I have made specialties. I have 
tried, moreover, to inspire such respect for 
made-over dinners, as we feel for the pretty 
rugs made of the ravellings of Axminster 
carpets. We do not attempt to impose them 
upon ourselves or our friends as " pure 
Persian.'' But neither do we blush for them 
because Mrs. Million Aire across the way 
would scorn to give them house-room. Let 
"Consistency'' be stamped upon every 
appointment of your household, and even the 

{<arveHue opposite cannot despise you. Once 
earn the truth that moderate, or even scanty 
means do not make meanness or honieliness 
a necessity, and act upon the lesson, and 
you can set criticism at defiance. Apropos 
to this point of consistency, let me say, in 
explanation, not apology, tor the small space 
devoted to company-dinners, that I have 
dealt with them upon the principle that ten 
times one makes ten. Having, in emulation 
of the Eastern bea;uty. carried the calf with 
ease for four weeks, you will hardly appre- 
ciate the difference in the weight of the cow 
fou lift upon the ufth. In plainer phrase, 
give John and the children good dinners, 
well-cooked, and daintily served, every day, 
and the entertainment of half-a-dozen friends 
in addition to the family party will cease to 
be a stupendous undertaking. They have 
a saying in the Southern States that aptly 



expresses the labor and excitement attendant 
upon such an event in too many families 
the straining after Mrs. Million Aires diner$ 
a la Rusu, which presuppose the despotism 
of a chef in the kitchen, and the solemn 
pomp ot a Chief Butler in the tallia manger. 
The Southern description of the frantic 
endeavor is— "Trying to put the big pot 
into the little one. " and it is invariably used 
with reference to preparations for company. 
Be content, my dear sister, to put into your 
little pot only so much as it will decently 
hold, and be thankful that you have in i* a 
sure gauge of responsibility. 

I have spoken of dinners for fom weeks 
in each month. I have written receipt! 

c i***', ""'"'^r, not in forgetfulne* 
of the fact that there is but one Febru- 
ary per annum, but because the need of 
adapting the bills of fare to the days of the 
week, instead of the month, was absolute 
and if I wished the Dinner Year-Book to 
be a perpetual calendar. I must say nothing 
of the broken week that jsometimes ends 
and sometimes begins thi'ltaonth. The dif- 
ficulty of disposing satisfactorily of the two 
or three odd days brought to my mind 
while blocking out my work, the summary 
manner in which one of mv baby-giris once 
dismissed a somewhat analogous difficulty. 

" My dear," I said to her one night as she 
concluded her prayer at my knee, "you 
have forgotten to pray for your little cousins. 
How did that happen ? Don't you want our 
Heavenly Father to take care of them ? " 

She made a motion of again bending her 
knees, yawned sleepily, and tumbled into 
bed. 

" Can't help it, mamma I Baby is too 
tired ! Horace and Eddie muit scuffle for 
themselves just this one night ! " 

I have given you twenty-eight— nay, 
counting your possible company-meal— 
twenty-nine dinners in succession to little 
purpose if you cannot collate from previous 
receipts one or two for yourself, and be the 
better for the practice. I need hardly say 
that I do not anticipate or desire slavish ad- 
herence to the plan sketched for your day or 
week. I have sketched— that is all— not 
worked out a sum in which addition or 
subtraction would materially affect the sum- 
total. The tramework is, I would fam hope, 
symmetrical. I expect you to build there- 
•ipon as convenience or discretion mav 
dictate.

TOUOHINa SAUOBPANS. 



attractive neatness of the display and your 
corner, will win sceptics, first, to indulg- 
ence, then, admiration, then, to imitation. 
If ycu can afford the great luxury of a pastry 
or mixing-room, adjoining the kitchen, so 
much the better for you and your pious 
undertaking. But without regard to what 
may be the efifect upon others, have your 
saucepans, of whatever designs and in what- 
ever qualities you like — taking " saucepan '' 
as a generic term for every description of 
mute helpers in the task of elevating cook- 
ery into a fine art, or, at the least, in re- 
deeming it from the st<gma of coarseness 
and Vulgarity. 

Have, also, as au indispensable adjunct of 
saucepans, appliances for cleansing them. 
There is nothing inherently degrading in 
dish-washing. Provide plenty of towels an J 
hot water ; a mop with a handle and a loop 
by which to hang it up when it has been 
squeezed and shaken after use ; a soap- 



shaker — a neat wire cup, enclosing the soap, 
and furnished with a handle of tinned wire, 
and a dish-pan, with a partition running 
across the middle, and the soiled articles 
may be rinsed from grease in one of the 
compartments before they are purified 
thoroughly in the other. Have, also, at 
hand a can or box of washing soda, and a 
bottle of ammonia for taking off the grease 
more effectually ; a cake of Indexical silver 
soap in a cup with a brush, for restoring 
lustre to tins, Britannia or plated, or silver 
ware. Thus armed, the cleansing of your 
implements will be a matter of brief mo- 
ment, and your work in the kitchen be, in 
no sense, a hindrance to the stated duties of 
the day, while your methods and occasional 
presence cannot fail to be a refining in- 
fluence upon all except the very common 
and spiritually unclean. Ladyhood, if 
thorough, will assert itself, even behind a 
scullion's apron.

Cblbry Salad. 

2 bunches of celery. 

I lablespoonful of salad oil. 

4 tablespoonfuls of vinegar. 

T small teaspoonful fine sugar. 

Pepper and salt to taste. 

Wash abd scrape the celery, lay in ice- 
cold water until dinner-time, when cut into 
inch-lengths, season, tossing all well up to- 
gether, and serve in a salad bowl. 

Cauliflower au gratin. 

I large cauliflower. 

4 tablespoonfuls grated cheese. 

I cup drawn butter. 

Pepper and salt. A pinch of nutmeg. 

Boil the cauliflower until tender (about 
twenty minutes), having first tied it up in a 
bag of coarse lace or tarlatan. Have ready 
a cup of good drawn butter, and pour over 
the cauliflower, when you have drained and 
dished the latter. Sift the cheese thipkly 
over the top, and brown by holding a red- 
hot shovel so close to the cheese that it 
singes and blazes. Blow out the fire on the 
instant, and send to the tabli. 

Mashed PoTinfes. 
Pare the potatoes very ifcin, lay in cold 
water for an hour, and cover well with boil- 
ing water. ("Peach-blows" are better put 
down in cold water.) Boil quickly, and 
when done, drain off every drop of water ; 
throw in a little salt ; set back on the range 
for two or three minutes. Mash soft with 
a potato-beetle, or whip to a cream with a 
fork, adding a little butter and enough milk 
to make a soft paste. Heap in a smooth 
mound upon a v^etable dish. 

Stewed Tomatoes. 

Open a can of tomatoes an hour before 
cooking them. Leave out the cores and un- 
ripe parts. Cook always in tin or porcelain 
saucepans. Iron injures ^color and flavor. 
Stew gently for half an hour ; season to taste 
with salt, pepper, a ittle sugar, and a table- 
spoonful of butter. Cook gently, uncovered, 
ten minutes longer, and turn into a deep 
dish. 

Blancmange. 

I liberal quart of milk. 

1 oz. Cooper's Gelatine. 

f of a cup of white sugar. 

2 teaspoonfuls vanilla. 

Soak the gelatine for two hours in a 
breakfast cup of dold water. Heat the milk 
to boiling in a farina-kettie, or in a tin pail 
set in a pot of hot water. Add the soaked 
gelatine and sugar, stir for ten minutes over 
the fire, and strain through a thin muslin 



bag into a mould wet with cold water. 
Flavor and set in a cold place to form. To 
loosen it, dip the mould for one instant in 
hot water, detach the surface from the sides 
by a light pressure of the fingers, and re- 
verse over a glass or china dish. Serve 
with powdered sugar and cream 

By all means have Sunday desserts pre- 
pared upon the preceding day. To this 
end, I have endeavored to give such receipts 
for the blessed day as can be easily made 
ready on Saturday. 

Cocoa. 

6 taplespoonfuls of cocoa to each pint of 
water. 

As much milk as you have water. 

Sugar to taste. 

Rub the cocoa smooth in a little cold 
water. Have ready on the fire the pint of 
boiling water. Stir in the grated cocoa-, 
paste. Boil twenty minutes ; add the milk, 
and boil five minutes more, stirring often. 

Sweeten in the cups to suit difiierent 
tastes. 

There is a preparation of cocoa, already 
powdered, called " Cocoatina," which needs 
no boiling. It is very good, and saves the 
trouble of grating and cooking. I regret 
that, although I have used it frequently and 
with great satisfaction, I have forgotten the 
name of the manufacturer. It is put up in 
round boxes, like mustard, and is quite as 
economical for family use as the cakes of 
cocoa. 

Sponge Cake. 

6 eggs. The weight of the eggs in sugar. 

Half their weight in flour. 

I lemon juice and rind. 

Beat yolks and whites very light, separ- 
ately of course, the powdered sugar into the 
yolks when they are smooth and thick ; next, 
the juice and grated peel of the lemon ; then 
the whites with a few swift strokes ; at last, 
the flour, in great, loose handfuls. Stir in 
lightly, but thoroughly. Too much beating 
after the flour goes in makes sponge cake 
tough. Bake in round tin moulds, buttered. 
Your oven should be steady. When the 
cakes begin to color on top, cover with paper 
to prevent burning. 

When cool, wrap in a thick cloth to keep 
fresh.

Said an irascible householder to a friend

class, who are the strength and glory of our 
land, would dare take an unexpected euest 
home on washing-day. although feweP still

Soup a l'Italienne. 

The stock of Sunday's soup strained from 
the carrots. 
Half a cup of grated cheese and a cup of 

3 tablespoonfuls of corn-starch wet uo 
with water. *^ 

2 eggs beaten light. 

Put the soup on fifteen minutes before 
dinner, where it will heat quickly. The 
moment it boils, draw it to one side, stir in 
the corn-starch and milk and heat anew, stir- 
ring constantly until it begins to thicken, 
bet It again upon the side of the range, and 
add the beaten eggs. Cover and leave it 
where it will keep hot, but not cook, while 
you scald the tureen and put the grated 
cheese in the bottom. In five minutes pour 
the soup upon the cheese, stir all up weU 
and It IS ready for the table. 
This is a delicious soup and easily made. 

Breaded Mutton Chops— Baked. 
Trim the chops neatly and put aside the 
bones and bits of skin for the sauce for 
macaroni. Pour a little melted butter over 
the meat. Do this as early in the day as 
convenient, cover them and let them stand 
until an. hour before they are to be served. 
Then, roll each in beaten egg, next, in fine 
cracker-dust (you can buy it ready pow- 
dered) and lay them in your dripping^an 
with a very little water in the bottomljust 
enough to keep them from burning. Bake 
quickly— covering the dripping-pan with 
another-for half an hour.*^*^Then renTove 
the upper, baste the chops with butter and 
hot water and let them brown. When 
done, lay them upon a hot dish and set in 
the open oven to keep warm. Add to the 
gravy m the dripping-pan a little hot water, 
a teaspoonful of browned flour, a table- 
spoonful of catsup, a *«««/ quantity of minced 
onion, pepper and salt. Boil up once 
strain, and pour over the chops. 

Macaroni with Tomato Sauce. 
Break the macaroni into short pieces, and 
set over the fire with enough boiling water to 
cover It well, as it swells to treble its ori- 
ginal dimensions. In twenty minutes it 
should be tender. Drain off the water care- 
fully not to break the macaroni, and stir 

lightly into It DennAr aaU a„A ^ *^ut

pour over it a sauce made as follows : To

.until you have less than a cupful of good 
gravy. Strain out the bones, etc.. season to 
taste, and add what was left from the stewed 
tomatoes of yesterday. Having had the 
provision for to-day's dinner in mind, you 
will have acted wisely in seeing for yourself 
that it did not go into the swill pail "under 
the head of "scraps." Cook tomatoes and 

eavy together for three minutes after they 
gin to simmer, and pour, smoking hot. 
over the macaroni. Let it stand covered a 
few minutes before serving. 

Potato Puff. 

To two cupfuls of cold mashed potato 
(moreof yestrday's leavings), add a table- 
spoonful of -Ited butter, and beat to a 
cream. Put with this two eggs whipped 
light, and a cupful of milk, salting to taste. 
Beat all well ; pour into a greased baking- 
dish, and bake <^uickly to a light brown. 
Serve in the dish m which it was cooked.

Heat the milk to scalding, and stir into it 
the com-stnrch until it has boiled ten minutes 
and is thick and smooth throughout. Add 
salt and butter, let the pudding stand in the 
farina-kettle in which it has been boiled— 
the hot water around it— for three minutes 
before turning it into a deep open dish. 

Eat with butter and sugar, or with pow- 
dered sugar and cream, with nutmeg grated 
over it. 

Coffee. 

A French coffee-pot is a convenience on 
.Monday. If you have one, you know how 
to use it. If not. put a quart of tx)iling 
water into your coflfee-pot ; wet up a cupful 
of ground coffee with the white of an egg. 
adding the egg-shell, and a little cold water. 
Put this into the boiling hot water, and boil 
fast ten minutes. .Then, add half a cup of

3 quarts of water. 

I onion. 

I turnip. 

8 stalks of celery. 

1 cupful pearl barley. 
Salt and pepper to taste 

Crack the bones and mince the meat early 
in the day. if you dine near midday, and put 
on with the cold water. Soak the barley in 
lukewarm water, after washing it well, and 
when it has lain in the tepid bath for two 
hours, put it in the same over the fire to 
cook slowly, keeping it covered fully by 
adding hot water from the kettle. Wash, 
scrape and chop the vegetables ; cover with 
cold water, and stew in a saucepan by them- 
selves. When they are very soft, rub them 
through a colander ; add the water in which 
they were cooked, and keep hot until the 
meat in the soup-kettle has boiled to rags. 
For this purpose four hours are better than 
three. Stram out bones and meat ; put 
soup-siock. barley (with the water in which 
it has boiled), vegetable broth, pepper and 
salt, into one kettle and boil slowly for thirty 
minutes. A little chopped parsley is an 
improvement. 

Rolled Beefsteaks. 

2 good sirloin steaks. 
Bread-crumbs. 

A slice of fat salt pork. 

Seasoning, a little minced onion, pepper 
and salt. 

Takeout the bones from the steak and 
throw them into the soup-pot. If your 
butcher has not already done so, beat the 
meat flat with the broad side of a hatchet, 
and cover it with a force-meat made of bread 
crumbs, minced pork, and half an onion. 
Moisten this slightly with water, and season 
to taste. Roll each steak up. closely enclos- 
ing the stuf&ng ; bind with twine into two 
compact bundles and lay in a dripping-pan. 
Dash a cupful of boiling water over each, 
cover with an inverted pan, and bake about 
three-quarters of an hour, in their own 
steam. At the end of this time remove the 
cover, baste with butter and dredge with 
flour to brown the meat. When they are of 
a fine color, lay upon a hot dish. Thicken 
the gravy with a little browned flour, boil 
up and send to table in a boat. In removing 
the strings from the rolled beef prior to 
serving, clip them in several places, that the 
form of the meat may not be disturbed.

Soak the peas all night in soft' water 
changing It in the morning for warm-not

the peas with four quarts of cold water. 
Boil m this-adding the meat, cut small, 
the bones well cracked and the celery-four 
hours. Alwap boil soups slowlf The 
neglect of this rule leaves in the kettle a 
mass of toughened meat and an ocean of 
dish-water. 

When you are ready to take up your soup 
strain in a colander, picking out and castimr 
aside bits of bones and shreds of meat Rub 
the peas and celery through the holes of the 
strainer until nothing more will pass. 
Season with pepper and salt ; add the Juice

be of a nice brown, and tender throughout 
Remove to a hot dish and garnish with

game. Anchovy is preeminently a fish 
sauce, but many do not like it.

JANUARY. 






Leo of Mutton — Boiled. 
Do not have the mutton too fat or too 
laree. Cut oflf the shank, which the butcher 
will have nicked for you, leaving about two 
inches bpyond the ham. Wash and wipe 
carefully and boil in hot water, with a little 
salt until a fork will readily pierce the 
thickest part. About ten or twelve minutes 
to the pound is a good rule in boiling fresh 
meat. Serve with caper sauce. Since you 
intend to use the liquor in which the meat 
is boiled for to-morrow's soup, do not over- 
salt it. But sprinkle, instead, salt over the 
leg of mutton after it is dished ; rub it all 
over with butter and set in a hot oven for a 
single minute. 

Caper Sauce. 

1 cup of the liquor in which the meat has 
been boiled. 

2 teaspoonfuls of flour rubbed smooth in a 
little water. Salt to taste. 

2 tablespoonfuls of butter. 

About two dozen capers or green nastur- 
tium-seed. ^ 

Heat the liquor to boiling, and skim before 
stirring in the flour, which must be perfectly 
free from lumps, and rubbed smooth in cold 
water. Stir until the sauce thickens evenly. 
It is best to cook all sauces in a vessel set 
within a larger one of hot water. When it 
has boiled about a minute, add the butter 
gradually, stirring each bit in well before 
putting in more. Salt, and drop in the 
capers. Let it just boil, and turn into a 
sauce-boat. 

Spinach. 

Pull the spinach from the stalks, leaf by 
leaf; wash carefully, and leave in cola vvater 
one hour. . Boil in hot water fifteen rvinutss. 
Drain very dry in a colander ; chop extren: e- 
ly fine in a wooden bowl, then return to the 
saucepan with a tablespoonful of butter, a 
little salt, and a teaspoonful of white sugar. 
As it heats beat it up with a wooden spoon 
until it is a soft paste. Let it bubble up 
once, and dish. La. a hard-boiled egg or 
twot cut in thin slices, upon the surface. 
Few vegetables are more often ruined in the 
cooking than spinach. The above receipt 
is simple and good. 

Stewed Potatoes. 
Pare and cut into large dice some good 
potatoes. Lay in cold water half an hour. 
Stew in cold water a little salted. There 
should be enough water to cover them 
well. When they are tender and begin to 
crumbie at the , edges, drain oa bail the 
water, and pour is as much milk. When 
-4hey are again scalding hot, stir in a lump 
of butter the sue of an agg (for a large dish^ 
rolled in flour, salt, pepper and choppea 
parsley to taste. Boil up once and serve in 
a covered dish. 



Cottage Pudding 
I cup of powdered sugar. 
I cup ot sweet milk. 

1 tablespoonful of butter. 

2 eggs, beaten light, yolks and whites 
separately. 

Saltspoonful of salt. 

About 3 cups of Hecker's prepared flour, 
enough for cake-batter. 

Rub the butter well into the sugar ; add 
beaten yolks ; the milk, salt, then whipped 
whites and yolks alternately. Bake in a 
buttered mould. When you can bring out 
the testing-straw clean from the middle of 
the loaf, turn it out upon a dish. Cut in 
slices while hot, as it is wanted. 

One who has never tried it can hardly be- 
lieve that the result of a receipt which may 
be tried fearlessly by a novice in cookery, 
could be the really elegant pudding just 
described. 

It is also as economical as toothsome. 

Sauce for Cottage Puddino?' 

2 cups of powdered sugar. 

2 tablespoonfuls of butter.

I glass sherry wine. 

Nutmeg or cinnamon to taste.

water gradually ; then spice and wine.

JANUABY. 



FIRST WEEK. 



FRIDAY. 






soup maiork. 

boiled cod. roast duck with bread sauce. 

mashed potatoes. rice croquettes. 

stewed celery. 

apple pie. 

Soup Maigre. 

I quart of milk. 

8 pints of water. 

I onion. 

I turnip, 

3 stalks of celery. 

1 potato f large). 

Quarter of a small cabbage, sliced. 
i cup of bread-crumbs, very dry. 

2 eggs, beaten light. 

Parsley, pepper, and salt to taste. 
' 4 tablespoonfuls of butter. 

Clean, scrape, and mince the vegetables, 
and put on to cook in cold watei. enough to 
cover them well. When they are scalding 
hot, drain, and cover them with three jiints 
of boiling water. Stew slowly in this until 
they are reduced to pulp. Rub through a 
colander, season, and heat again to boiling. 
Stir in the bread-crumbs ; then the butter, 
very gradually. Have the milk ready, heated 
in another vessel, and pour into the soup- 
kettle at this juncture. Let the soup get 
very hot, but not boil. Set upon the side 
of the range, and, dipping out a cupiul, add 
it, -a little at a time, to the beaten eggs. 
When well mixed, return eggs and liquor to 
the rest of the soup ; stir over the fire for an 
instant, but never to boiling, and serve in a 
hot tureen. 

The eggs should not be allowed to curdle 
in the liquor ; hence the need of carefulness 
in following the directions above given. A 
little grated cheese is a pleasant accompani- 
ment to this soup, each person adding it as 
pleases him. 

Boiled Cod. 

Lay the fish in cold water, a little salt, for 
half an hour. Wipe dry, and sew up in a 
linen cloth, coarse and clean, fitted to the 
shape of the piece of cod. Have but one fold 
over each part. Lay in the fish-kettle, cover 
with boiling water, salted at discretion. 
Allow nearly an hour for a piece weighing 
four pounds. 

Sauce. 

To one gill of boiling water allow as much 
milk : stir into this, while boiling, two table- 
spoonfuls of butter, adding graduaiiy a table- 
spoonful of flour wet up with cold water, 
and, as it thickens, the chopped yolk of a 
boiled egg and one raw egg, beaten light. 
Tike directly from the fire, season with 



pepper, salt, a little chopped parsley ana 
the juice of a lemon, and set, covered, in 
boiling water, but not over the firb, for 
five minutes, stirring occasionally. Pour 
part of the sauce over the fish when 
dished ; the rest iu a boat. Send around 
mashed potatoes with it. 

Roast Duck. 
Clean the duck very carefully, rinsing it 
out with a little soda and water, and after- 
wards with fresh water. Lay in cold, salted 
water for an hour. Wipe dry, inside and 
out, and stuff with a dressing of bread- 
crumbs, seasoned with pepper and salt, a 
very little powdered sage and a " suspicion" 
of minced onion. Sew up; dash a cup of 
boiling water over them, as they lie in the 
dripping pan, and roast, covered, for the 
first half-hour. Remove the cover, and baste 
freely — three times with butter and water, 
four or five times with the gravy from the 
pan. Stew the giblets in a little salted water, 
and reserve to piece out to-morrow's salmi. 
Dish the ducks upon a hot platter. 

Bread Sauce. 

Skim the fat well from the gravy left in 
the dripping-pan ; have ready a handful of 
bread-oruirbs (stale), wet up with hot water. 
Thicken the gravy with these when it has- 
come to a boil ; season with pepper, salt, 
and a pinch of mace. Boil all together once 
and surve. 

Mashed Potatoes. 

See receipt fc r Sunday. 

While I would spare you all waste of time 
and pains in looking up receipts in other 
parts of this volume, I yet deem it hardly 
worth while to write out in full the same 
directions twice for the same week — or 
month. 

Rice Croquetths. 

I cup of cold boiled rice. 

I teaspoonful of sugar, and half as much 
salt. 

I teaspoonful of melted butter. 

I egg, beaten light. 

Enough milk to make the rice into stiff 
paste. 

Sweet lard for frying. 

Work rice, butter, egg, etc., into an adhe- 
sive paste, beating each ingredient thorough- 
ly into the mixture. Flour your hands and 
make the rice into oval balls. Dip each in 
beaten egg, then in flour, or cracker-dust, and 
fry in boiling lard, a few at a time, turning 
each with great care. When the croquettes 
are of a fine yellow bi'uwn, take out with a 
wire spoon and lay within a heated colan- 
der to drain off every drop of fat. Serve 
hot, with sprigs of parsley laid about them, 
in an uncovered diw.

DAdge with flour and fry in hot dripping,

Drain off two-thirds of the water, and add 
enough milk to cover the salsify. Stew ten

this by pinching the largest, Wipe off and 
serve in their skins.

and sugar to a cream with lemon-peel and a 
little salt, and stir into the warm milk. Mix 
well and bake in a buttered dish in a brisk 
oven. Eat warm or cold. We like it better 
warm, with a little cream poured over it 
when served in saucers. 



SECOND WEEK. 



SUNDAY. 



SOUPE AU JULI9NNE. 
ROAST TIJRKEY. CRANBERRY SAUCE. 

MASHBD POTATOES, BROWNED. STEWED CORN. 
* CELERY. 



TROPICAL SNOW. 
LIGHT CAKES AND COFFEE. 

SoupE xu Julienne. 

6 lbs. of lean beef. If possible, g;et it from 
the shin and hav9 the accompanying bones 
cracked to bi^. 



6 quarts of water — cold. 

Prepare the stock on Saturday. Put meat 
and bones into a pot with a close .cover, 
uour on the water, and set it where it will 
heat very slowly. Boil, also very slowly, 
Aix hours, at the back of the range. Should 
the water sink fast in the pot, replenish from 
the boiling tea-kettle. At the end of six 
hours, turn the soup, meat, bones, and all, 
into an ekrthenw^ire vessel ; pepper and salt it 
and set on the cellar floor, covered, until 
next day. Take off, then, tne cake of excel- 
lent dripping from the top ; strain the soup 
and set over the Are, aboat an hour before 
dinner, and heat gradually. 

The vegetables should be— 

2 carrots. 

3 turnips. 

Half a head of cabbage. 

I pint Shaker corn, soaked overnight. 

6 stalks of celery. 

I quart of tomatoes. 

I large onion. 

Clean, scrape, and mince all these, except 
the com and tomatoes. Cut the carrot 
into dice and stew, by itself, in a little cold 
water. Boil the corn in enough water to cover 
it, and add more hot water as it swells. Cover 
the minced vegetables with cold water, and 
so soon as it boils, turn it off, and replenish 
with boiling, from the kettle. This will take 
away the rank taste from cabbage and onion. 
When they are soft enough to pulp, strain 
well, but without pressing, into the soup. It 
is needless to add the vegetables, as th^ 
strength is in the liquor. Boil up and skim 
the soup before putting in the boiled com 
and the canned tomatoes, which should be 
cut up small, and the unripe parts removed. 
Boil fifteen minutes, add the carrot, season 
to taste, and serve.* 

RoAST Turkey. 

Rinse out the turkey well with soda and 
water; then with salt ; lastly, with fair water. 
Stuff with a dressing made of bread-crumbs, 
wet up with butter and water and seasoned 
to your taste. Stuff the craw and tie up the 
neck. Fill the body and sew up the vent. 
I need hardly say that these strings are to be 
clipped and removed after the fowl is roasted. 
Tie the legs to the lower part of the body 
that they may not " sprawl," as the siaews 
shrink. Put into the dripping-pan, pour a 
teacupful of boiling water over it, and roast, 
basting often, allowing about ten minutes 
time for every pound. Be careful not to 
have your oven too hot — especially during 
the first half-hour or so. The turkey would, 

* As I have mentioned in " Breakfast, Luncheon, 
ind Tea," vou can spare yourselves the truable of 
preparing the veeetables tot this soup by buying those 
shred and dried for this purpose, put up. in papkaces 
and sold by grocers. 



8KC0ND WEEK — SUNDAY— MONDAY. 



othenviM, be dry and blackened on the 
out8.de and raw within. And remember 
how much of the perfection of roasting meats 
and poultry depends upon basting faithfully.

gravy-boat. 

Cranberry Saock. 

Wash an'', pick over the cranberries ; put 
on to cook in a tin or porcelain vespel. 
allowing a teacupful of water to each quart 
Stew slowly, stirring often until they are as 
thick as marmalade. Take from the fire in 
little over an hour, if they have cooked 
steadily, sweeten plentifully with white suijar 
and strain through coarse tarlatan, or mos^ 
quito-net. into a mould wet with cold water 

n„7?J ?" Saturday. On Sunday, turn 
out into a glass dish. 

Mashed Potatoes— Browned. 
Having mashed them in the usual manner 
mound them smoothly upon a shallow 
earthenware dish and set them in a quick 
oven, glozing them with butter as they color 
They should be of a light brown. Slip the 
mound from a coarser to a finer platter by 
the helo of your cake-turner. It is still 
better if you have one of the pretty •■ enam- 
elled bake dishes lined with porcelain with 
Sliver stands for the table. They are in- 
valuable for puddings, ssallops. etc. 
Stewed Corn. 
Stew one quart of Canned corn in its own 
liquor, setting the vessel containing it in an 
outer, of hot water. Should the corn be 
exceptionally dry. add a little cold water 
When tender, pour in enough milk to cover 
the corn, bring to a boil, and put in a table- 
spoonful of butter rolled in flour, and salt to 
taste. Stew gently, stirring well, every three 
or four minutes, and turn into a deep dish 
Keep the vessel containing tae corn closely 
covered while it is cooking. The steam 
lacilitates the process and preserves the 
color of the corn. 

Celery 
Is the usual accompaniment of roast turkey 
Prepare by selecting the blanched stalks 
scrapmg ofl the rust, cutting oflF all but the 
youngest and tenderest tops, and laying these 
in cold water to crisp until wanted for the 
table. Garnish your turkey with alternate 
"5"' aaa aarfi green sprigs of celery.

It. Over the layer of oranges spread one o{

round slices, and lay these, one deep, upon 
the cocoanut. Repeat the order just given 
until your dish is full and the orange,* and 
bananas used up. The top layer must be 
of cocoanut, heaped high, sprinkled with 
powdered sugar and garnished about the

Next Days Soup. 
Julienne soup, like most other soups the 
base of which is meat, is better when 
warmed over the second day. Set it over 
the fire where it will heat, not too quickly 
almost to a boil. It will not •• put back" the 
business of the day twenty minutes, and be 
a welcome addition to your dinner. 
Turkey Scallop. 
Cut the meat from yesterday's turkey 
hHVZ 'i -^ "'■'=a«s to pieces, and put, with 
bits of skin, fat and gristle, into a ^ucepan; 
cover with cold water, and set on to stew 
slowly into gravy. Chop the meat very 
fine ; strew the bottom of a greased bake- 
dish with crumbs, and cover this with a 
thick stratum of minced turkey, stuffine 
and tmy bits of butter. Pepper and salt 
and put on more crumbs, then meat, and m 
on. Stale bread is better for this scallop 
than cracker-dust. Having used up all your 
meat and reserved enough crumbs for a 
thick upper crust, cover the dish and nnt 
asiae ma cool place until y<jur gravy is 
ready. It is economy of time, on Monday 
to slip m such work as this between the

vert a plate over the bake-dish and set in the 
oven. When, at the end of half an hour or 
so, the gravy bubbles up at the sides, remove 
the cover and brown. Serve in the pud- 
ding-dish. 

Pannbd Oysters. 

A four-course dinner is hardly in order in 
most households on "Tonday. You can, if 
you like, and have an efficient table-waiter, 
bring on oysters, as usual, between soup 
and meat. But there will be no violation of 
the " unities of the drama'' of a family din- 
ner, if you send around your oysters, scal- 
lop, and vegetables together. 

I quart of oysters. 

Some thin slices of toast. 

Butter, salt, and pepper. 

Have ready some " pattypans " — the more 
nearly upright the sides the better. ' Cut 
stale bread in rounds to fit the bottom of 
these. Toast, and lay a piece in each. Wet 
with oyster liquor and put into each pan as 
many oysters as it will conveniently hold. 
Pepper and salt ; put a bit of butter upon 
each ; arrange all in a large dripping-pan ; 
invert another of the same size over it, and 
bake eight minutes, or until the oysters 
" ruffle. " Send hot to table in the pans. 

You caiv ' ?,st the bread at breakfast-time 
ifyouchoo^j. The oysters can go into the 
oven when the soup is poured out, and be in 
good season on the table. By this arrange- 
ment they will not interfere with the other 
" baked meats.'' Panned oysters are always 
popular, and there is no more simple manner 
of cooking this favorite shell-fish. 

Roast Potatoes. 

Choose l&Tf{<t, fairpctaloes, wash and wipe 
and bake untJ "oit to the grasp. Three- 
should 9umce. Take out, 
' h ; "vipi- oflf dust and

pot :elain. stew half an hour, gently ; add 
salt, pepper a teaspoonful of sugar, artvl 
three of butter, a handful of dry bread- 
criiimbs, or, if you have any stewed corn left 
fron)» yesterday, use that instead of bread. 
Coot "n minutes longer, and turn out. ^ 

Floating Island. 

I quart of milk. 

4 eggs, whites and yolks beaten separately. 

4 tablespoonfuls (great ones) of sugar. 

a teaspoonfuls extract of bitter almonds or 
vanilla. (Coloate'h extracts are the best in 
market, and do not ipoil within a few days 
after they are uncorked, as the manner of 
some is.) 

^ cup of currant jelly. 

Heat the milk to scalding, but not tx>iling. 
Beat the yolks, stir into them the sugar, and 
pour upon them, gradually and mixing well, 
a cupful of the hot milk. Return to the 
saucepan and boil until it begins to thicken. 
You can do this while breakfast is cooking, 
before the Moloch cloches-boiler goes on. 
When cool, flavor and pour into a glas.j dish . 
Heap upon the top a meringue of the whites 
whipped until you can cut it, into which you 
have beaten the jelly, a teaspoonful at a 
time. 

Tea. 

"A comfortable cup of tea" never comes 
amiss to a fagged housewife, be it served at 
breakfast, luncheon, or dinner. The best 
way to insure its goodness — that is, that it 
be strong, hot and fresh — is to have your 
own tea-urn or kettle on the table, with a 
spirit-lamp burning under it. Scald the tea- 
pot, put in the tea ; cover with boiling 
water; put a " cosey'' or a thick napkin 
about it, and let it stand five minutes before 
filling with more boiling water. Wait a 
minute longer and pour out.

SECOND WEEK. WEDNESDAY. 

BEAN "OUP. 

fillet of veal, stuffed. baked corn. 

potato cakes. 

canned string-beans. 

baked apple dumplings, 
brandy sauce. 

Bean Soup. 

Soak a quatt of dried beans all night in 
soft «;ater. Throw this off next morning, 
and cover the beans for two hours in water 
a little more than lukewarm. Put over the 
fire with five quarts of cold water, and one 
pound of salt pvork. A bone of veal or beef 
may be added, if you have it. Boil slowly 
for at least four hours ; shred into it a small 
onion, four stalks of celery, pepper— tke 
pork may salt it sufficiently — simmer half 
an hour longer, rub through a Colander 
until only husks and fibres remain, and 
send to table. Pass sliced lemon with it. 

Fillet of Veal — Stuffed. 

Make ready a force-meat df bread-crumbs, 
chopped thyme and parsley, pepper, salt, 
and a pinch uf nutmeg ; a little dripping for 
shortening ; moisten with warm water and 
bind with a raw egg. 

If your butcher has not "put up'' the 
fillet, remove the bone, pin the meat into a 
round with skewers ; then bind firmly with 
a strip of muslin passed two or three times 
about it. Fill the cavity left by the bone 
with dressing, and thrust the same between 
the folds of the meat, besides making cuts 
with a sharp knite to receive more. 
Tuck in a strip of fat pork here and there. 
Baste three times with salt and water 
while roasting, afterwards with its own 

fravy. At last, dredge once with flour and 
aste with butter. Cut the bands, draw out 
the skewers carefully, and serve. 

Baked Corn. 

To one can of corn allow a pint of milk 
(more ii the corn be dry), three eggs, two 
tablespoonfuls of melted butter, one of white 
sugar ; pepper and salt to taste. Beat the 
eggs very light, rub butter and sugar to- 
gether and stir in i\ard ; next, the com and 
seasoning ; finally, the milk. Beat hard, and 
bake in a buttered dish for half an hour, 
covered. Then brown by lifting ths top. 
Send up in the bake-dish. 



Potato Cakes. 

Boil and mash the potatoes, workii\g in 
salt and butter and an egg or two— beaten 
light. Let them get cold ; make into cakes 
of size and shape to suit yourself ; roll in 
raw egg, then in flour, or cracker-dust, and 
fry quickly in hot dripping. Take each up' 
as soon as it is done, and drain with a wire 
spoon, before laying upon a hot dish. 

Canned String-Beans. 

Cook in their own liquor half an hour, or 
until very tender. First, however, cut them 
into neat lengths. The comeliness of the 
dish depends upon this. When almost done, 
stir in a tablespoonful of butter, with salt 
and pepper. Simmer ten minutes longer, 
and serve by draining off the liquid and 
helping the beans upon a hot dish, with a 
bit of butter on the top. If the can does 
not contain liquor enough to cover the 
beans, add a little cold water in cooking 
them. 

Baked Apple Dumplings. 

I quart prepared flour, 
z tablespoonful of butter and the same of 
lard. 

I pint of milk. 

1 saltspoonful of salt. 
Some npe apples. 

Chop the shortening into the flour when 
yau have sifted and salted the latter. Wet 
up with milk and roll out quickly in a sheet 
less than half an inch thick. Cut into 
squares ; lay in the centre of each a tart, 
juicy apple, pared and cored. Bring the 
corners of the square together and pinch to 
join them neatly. Lay in a baking-pan, the 
joined edges downward, and bake to a fine 
brown. When done, brush over with butter 
and shut the oven-door for a minute more 
to glaze them. Sift powdered sugar over 
them, and eat hot. 

These are more wholesome and more 
easily prepared than boiled dumplings. Eat 
with sweet sauce. 

Brandy Sauce. 

2 cups of powdered sugar, 
i cup of butter. 

I wineglass of brandy. That from bran- 
died peaches — the liqueur, if you have it. 

I teaspoonful mixed cinnamon and mace. 

Warm the butter slightly, work in the 
sugar until they form a rich cream, when 
add brandy and spice. Beat hard ; shape by 
puiiiug iuiu a mould made very wet with 
cold wr.ter, and set in a cool place to harden. 
Should it not turn out readily by shaking 
gently, dip for a second in hot water.

FtSH CHOWDER. 
FRICASSEED CHICKEN, WHITE. 

POTATOES A L'lTALlENNE. 

tomatoes stewed with onion, 
cheese pondu. 

sponge gingerbread, 
chocolate. 

Fish Chowder. 
3 lbs. of cod, cut into strips an inch thick 
and four inches long, and freed from bone 
so far as is possible without breaking the 
fish. < 

1 pint of oysters. 

2 large onions cut into thin slices. 
About i lb. Boston crackers, split; and 

battered thickly. 
Pepper and salt. 
I cup of milk. ,p 

Parsley. 

Cover the bottom of your soup-kettle with 
the fish ; pepper and salt ; strew with sliced 
onion, and this with the split crackers, but- 
tered sides down. Follow this order until 
your ingredients are all in the pot. and cover 
them with cold water. Stew gently for an 
hour, keeping the water at the original level 
by replenishing from the tea-kettle. By 
this time the fish should be thoroughly 
done, if it has cooked steadily. Take it up 
with a perforated skimmer, and cover in the 
tureen to keep hot, while you strain the 
chowder to get out the bones, returning the 
crackers with the liquor to the soup-kettle, 
when you have rinsed it out. Thicken with 
two teaspoonfuls of corn-starch wet up in a 
cup of milk, and when this has boiled, add 
the oysters, cut small, two great spoonfuls of 
butter, and a little chopped parsley. Stew 
for three minutes, pour slowly over the fish 
in the tureen. Send sliced lemon around 
with it. 

This is a most palatable chowder when 
properly prepared. You can use fewer 
crackers, if you dislike a thick soup. 
I'RxCnSaiiEu Chicken — White. 

One pair of full-grown fowls. 

i lb. salt pork cut into strips. 

2 eggs. 



1 cupful of milk. 

2 tablespoonfuls of flour and the same of 
butter. 

I onion. 

Parsley, pepper and salt. 

Joint the fowls neatly, and cut the back, 
neck, and breast apart from each other, the, 
latter into two pieces. Lay them in salt 
water for half an hour. Put them into a pot 
with enough cold water to cover them, and 
the pork cut into thin strips. Cover and 
hear very slowly. Stew constantly, but 
never fast, for one hour after it comes to a 
boil, or until the chickens are tender. The 
time will depend upon their age. If they 
are tough, put them on early and cook all 
the more slowly. Add now the onion, pars- 
ley, and pepper, with salt, if needed. Heat 
again, and stir in the flour wet up in the 
cup of milk. Beat the eggs and pour upon 
them a cupful of hot gravy ; mix well, and 
put back into the soup with the butter. 
Just as the stew begins to simmer again, re- 
move from the fire. Take out and pile the 
chicken upon a dish ; then pour the gravy 
over all. 

Potatoes a l'Italienne. 

Instead of mashing the potatoes with a 
beetle or spoon, whip them up light with a 
silver fork. When they are fine and mealy, 
beat in a lew spoonfuls of milk, a table- 
spoonful of butter, the yolks of two eggs, 
pepper and salt. Whip into a creamy heap 
before adding, with a few dexterous strokes, 
the stiffly-frothed whites. Pile roughlv up 
on a buttered pie-dish ; brown quickly in 
the oven, and transfer, with the help of a 
cake-turner, to a flat dish. 

Make a rather too abundant dish, accord- 
ing to this receipt, as the residue will be 
found useful in to-morrow's bill of fare. 
Tomatoes Stewed with Onion. 

Stew in the usual manner, adding a small 
onion minced fine. When they have cooked 
half an hour, season with pepper, salt, a 
little sugar, and a good spoonful ot butter. 
Simmer ten minutes more, uncovered, and 
turn out. 

Cheese Fondu 

1 cup of bread-crumbs, dry and fine. 

2 scant cups of fresh milk.

Roast Beef, with Yorkshire Pudding. 

Have your meat ready for roasting on Sat- 
urday, always. Roast upon a grating or 
several clean sticks (not pine) laid over the 
dripping-pan. Dash a cup of boiling water 
over the beef when it goes into the oven ; 
baste often, and see that the fat does not 
scorch. About three quarters of an hour 
before it is done, mix the pudding. 

Yorkshire Pudding. 

1 pint of milk. 

4 eggs, whites and yolks beaten separ- 
ately. 

2 cups of flour— prepared flour is best. 
I teaspoonful of salt. 

Use less flour if the batter grows too stiff. 
Mix quickly ; pour ofl the fat from the top 
of the gravy in the dripping-pan leaving just 
enough to prevent the pudding from sticking 
to the bottom. Pour in the batter and con- 
tinue to roast the beef, letting the dripping 
fall upon the pudding below. The oven 
should be brisk by this time. Baste the 
meat with the gravy you have taken out to 
make room for the batter. 

In serving, cut the pudding into squares 
and lay about the meat in the dish. It is 
very delicious.

A cupful of prepared flour. 
^A little salt. 

I tablespconful of melted butter. 

Cut the meat from yesterday's roast into 
neat pieces ; lay them in the ' bottom of a 
buttered pudding-dish, season well, and pour 
a few spoonfuls of cold gravy over them, 
letting it soak into the meat while you pre- 
pare a batter according to the above direc- 
tions, taking care not to get it too stiff. Pour 
over the meat and bake in a quick oven. 
Eat hot.

Scored Potatoes. 

Mash in the usual way,fmixing;rather soft ; 
heap and round upon a greased pie-plate ; 
score deeply in triangles with the back of a 
carving or butcher's knife ; brown in .the 
oven, and slip carefully to another dish. 

Canned Peas. 
Open a can of peas an hour before cooking 
them, that there may be no musty, airless 
taste about them, and turn into a bowl. 
When ready for them, put on in a farina- 
kettle — or one saucepan within another — of 
hot water. If dry, add cold water to cover 
them, and stew about twenty-five minutes. 
Drain, stir in a generous lump of butter ; 
pepper and salt. 

Apple Meringue. 

Butter a neat pudding-dish, and nearly 
fill it with apple-sauce. Cover and leave in 
the oven until it is smoking hot. Draw to 
the oven door and spread with a meringue 
made of the whites of three eggs, whipped 
stiff with a little powdered sugar. (Your 
pudding will be much nicer, by the way, if 
you have beaten the yolks into the stewed 
apple before putting it into the dish.) Shut 
the oven door long enough to brown the 
meringue very lightly. Eat nearly or quite 
cold, with sugar and cream. 

Send around crackers and cheese as aa 
accompaniment.

while, cut two slices of corned (not smoked) 
bam into dice, wash well and put on to boil 
in • cup of cold water. Drain the macaroni, 
and when the ham has cooked foi ten min- 
utes after coming to a boil, pour it, with the 
liquor, over the macaroni. Season with pep- 
per, simmer in a closed farina-kettle lor fif- 
teen minutes ; add a little chopped parsley

serve in a deep dish. The fatter the ham the 
better for this dish. Always pass grated

heated napkin. 

Turnips. 

Boil sliced or quartered, until soft all 
r through ; drain well and mash in a colander 
with a wooden spoon or beetle, very quickly 
lest they should cool. Cold turnips are de- 
testable Work in a little salt and a good 
lump of butter ; serve in a hot dish, smoothly 
rounded on top, with a pat of pepper here 
iu;d there.

Roast Chicxsn. 

Wash well in three waters, adding a little 
soda to the second. StuflF with a mixture of 
bread-crumbs, butter, pepper, and salt. 
Fill the crops and bodies of the fowls ; sew 
tblm up with strong, not coarse thread, and 
tie up the necks. Pour a cupful of boiling 
water over the pair, and roast an horur— or 
more, if they are large. Baste three times 
with butter and water, four or five times 
with their own gravy. 

Stew the giblets, necks, and feet in water, 
enough tocover them well. When you take 
up the fowls, add this liquor to the gravy 
left in the dripping-pan, boil up once, thick- 
en with browned flour; add the giblets 
chopped fine ; boil again, and send up in a 
gravy-boat. 

Should there be more gravy than you 
need, set it away carefully. Each day 
brings forth a need for such. 

Crab-apple Jelly 

Is a pleasing sauce for roast fowls. 

Stewed Celery. 

Select the best blanched stalks, and day 

aside in cold water. Stew three or four 

stalks of the coarser parts, minced, with a 

small onion, a few sprigs of parsley, also 

chopped, and a bone of ham, or other meat. 

Stew for an hour in enough water to cover 

them ; strain, pressing hard. Cut the 

choicer celery into pieces two inches long ; 

pour over them the "stock" from the 

strainer, season with pepper, and, if needed, 

salt. Stew until very tender. Stir in a 

good tablespoonful of butter, and a little 

corn-starch, wet up in cold water. Simmer 

gently three minutes, and dish. 

Fried Salsify. 
Scrape and lay in cold water ten minutes. 
Boil tender, drain, and when cold, mash

4 stalks of celery.

Pepper and salt at discretion. 
6 quarts of cold water. 
Put the beef, cut into strips, 

cases " of the chickens broken 
and three quarts of col" -ater, into a large 
soup-pet, and heat gr^'.duaily. When it 
boils, skim well, and add the fried onion and 
other vegetables, cut fine, and three quarts 
more of cold water. Stew, with the pot-lid 
on, five hours, after it again boils, giving it 
no attention save to see that it never boils 
fast, and that the hquid has not diminished 
to less than three-quarters of the original 
quantity. Strain at the end of this time, 
first taking out the meat that has not boiled 
to slfreds, and the bones. Rub the vege- 
tables through the colander; afterwards 
strain the soup again through your wire 
strainer or sieve, into the kettle when you 
have washed it out. Season, and simmer 
ten minutes after the boil recommences, 
skimming often. Break the vermicelli into 
short lengths, put into the soup when you 
have taken out two quarts for Sundays 
"stock." Cook gently twelve minutes after 
the vermicelli goes in. 

At first glance, the quantity of meat pre- 
scribed for this soup may seem extravagant i 
but, apart from the fact that the coarser and 
cheaper quality is used, you must note that 
you re now the foundation of three days' 
soups, and that you have saved time, no lesa 
than money, by making this as I have di- 
rected. It is by the long, intelligent look 
ahead that the mistress proves ner right to 
the title.

MwTTON Chops— Broilkd. 

Next to beef, good mutton, properly 
cooked, deservM the met prominerft place 
among the meats upon your weekly bill of 
fare. It is digestible, nutritious, and. as a 
rule, popular. I therefore oflfer no apoloay 
for the regular and frequent appearance oV 
these two standard articles of diet upon 
these pages. They may well be named the 
twc. staves of healthful existence-for civil- 
ized humanity, at least. 

Trim your mutton chops, if your butcher 
has neglected to do it, leaving a naked end I 
ofboMe as a •handle" upon each. Lay I

butter, turning the.n several times. Then I 
ho Id each up for a moment, to let all the 
butter drip oflf that will, and broil over a 
clear fare, watching constantly and turning 
them often when the falling fat threatens f 
blaze from below. If your gridiron is be 
neath the grate, they can be cooked far more 
satisfactorily, and with one-tenth of the

Boiled Turkey and OTbTKR Sauci. 

13 oyateri. 

A little itMk, br«ad-cruinba, butter and 
Masoninf 

Wheat ho IT, 

Chop about fifteen oysters and work up 
with them bread-crumbs, a spoonful of but- 
ter, with pepper and salt. Stuflf the (urkey 
as for roasting ; sew it up, neatly, in a thin 
clot^ fitted to every part, having dredged 
the ^.3th well inside with flour. Boil slow- 
ly, especially at first, allowing fifteen 
minutes to a pound. The water should be 
lukewarm when the turkey goes in. Salt 
and nave the liquor in which the fowl was 
boiled. 

Oyster Sauck. 

12 oysters, cut into thirds. 

1 cupful of milk. 

2 tablespoonfuls of butter. 

2 ieaspoonfuls rice, or wheat fliosir. 

Flavoring to taste. 

Chopped parsley. 
Drain the liquor from the oysters before 
you cut them up. Boil the liquor two min- 
utes, and add the milk. When thisi is 
scalding hot, strain and return to the sauce- 
pan. Wet the flour with cold water and stir 
into the sauce. As it thickens, put in the 
butter, then pepper and salt, with a very 
little parsley. The juice of a half a lemon is 
a pleasant flavoring. Stir it in after taking 
the sauce from the fire. Before this, and so 
soon as the flour is well incorporated with 
the other ingredients, add the oysters, each 
cut into three pieces. Simmer five minutes 
and pour into a gravy-tureen. Some also 
pour a little over the turkey on the dish. 
Garnish with slices of boiled egg and celery 
tops. 

Savory Rice Pudding. 

I teacupful of rice. 

Giblets of the turkey. 

A slice of fat salt pork, chopped very fine. 

Half a small onion, also minced. 

I small cup of milk. 

I tablespoonful of butter. 

Pepper and salt. 

Wash the rice thoroughly ; clean the gib- 
lets ; soak them an hour in salted water, cut 
each into several pieces, and put on to stew 
with the pork and rice in nearly a quart of 
cold water. Cook slowly until the giblets 
are tender and the rice soft. The grains 
should be kept as whole as possible, so do 
not use a spoon in stirring, but shake up the 
oaucepan, which should be set in another 
of boiling water. The rice should, by this 
tnae, Dc licaiiy drjr. Take out the gibtets 
and chop fine. Pour on the rice the milk, 
previously heated with the minced onions. 



and then strained. When this is again 
scalding, stir in the giblets, then the batter 
and seaiioning. Cover and simmer fbr 
ten minutes. Wet a round or oval pan 
with cold water ; press the rice firmly into 
It, so that ;t may take the shape, and turn 
out carefully upon a flat dish. Set in the 
oven for two minutes before sending to 
table. It should be stiff enough to take the 
mould, yet not dry. 

Potatoes au Maitrk d'Hotel. 

Slice cold boiled potatoes a quarter of an 
inch thick, and put into a saucepan contain- 
ing enough milk, already heated, to cover 
them— barely. When all are smoking hot, 
add a tablespoonful or more of butter, 
pepper, salt and minced parsley. Add 
a feaspoonful of flour wet in cold water; 
heat quickly to a boil ; put in the juice of 
half a lemon ; pour into a deep dish without 
further cooking. 



Celery and Grape Jelly 

Should flank the castor, or epergne, or what- 
ever may be your centre-piece. 

Mince Pie. 
A receipt for mincemeat will be found in 
the proper order in the menu for next De- 
cember. I take it for granted that, like the 
wise woman you are, you have laid up in the 
store-room enough from your Christmas 
supply to last for some weeks to come. If 
not, let me advise you to get a box of 
"Atmorp's Celebrated Mince-Meat,' apd 
fill your pastry-crusts, instead of repeating 
so soon the tedious operation so lately per- 
formed. It comes in neat, wooden cans, and 
is really good. If you like, you can add more 
sugar and brandy. N. B—My John has a 
sweet tooth. Has yours ? k 

Make the paste by rubbing into a quart 
of your best flour one-third of a pound of 
sweet lard. Chop it in with a broad knife, 
if you have plenty of time. Wet up with ice- 
water, roll out very thin, and cover with 
"dabs" of butter, also of the best. Fold into 
a tight roll, flatten wilh a few strokes of the 
rolling-pin, and roll out into a sheet as thin 
as the first ; baste again with the butter ; 
roll up and out into a third sheet hardly 
thicker than drawing-paper; a third time 
dot with butter, and fold up closely. Having 
used as much butter for this purpose as you 
have lard, set aside your last roll for an hour 
in a very cold place. Then roll out, line 
your pie-plates with the paste, fill with 
mince-meat ; put strips, cut with a jagging- 
iron, across them in annarna nr trias^les. 
and bake in a steady, never a dull, heat. 

These pies, like all others, must be made 
on Saturday, and warmed up for Sabbath—

The bone from your steak, and half a can 
of sweet com. 
I onion, small. 
I Stalk of celery. 
Bunch of sweet herbs. 
Pepper and salt. 
3 quarts of water. 

Put on bones, ham (chopped), and the 
vegetables, cut up with the sweet herbs, but 
not the com, in a soup-kettle ; cover well 
with the liquor in which the turkw was 
cooked, and boil slowly, untouched, two 
hours. Take out the bones, and strain 'the 
soup, robbing the vegetables through the 
strainer, into a bowl. Return this to the 
fire and with it the com and turkey dress- 
ing. Bring to a gentle boil and keep it 
steady, for fully half an hour. Season, and 
simmer a quarter of an hour longer. The 
com and dressing will thicken it sufficiently. 
Beefsteak with Onions. 
While your steak is broiling, watched by 
some one else, fry three or four sliced onions 
in a pan with some beef dripping or butter. 
Stir and shake them until they b^n to 
brown. Dish your steak, salt and pepper, 
and lay the onions on top. Cover, and let 
all stand where they will keep hot. for five 
minutes. Do not help onions to any one 
unless you are sure that he likes them. 
There is no dish so good for keepn 
steak hot. yet juicy, as a hot water chafing- 
dish. No household can afford to be with- 
out one, if no more. 

Mixed Pickles 
Give the needed piquancy to steak. Home- 
made ones are best. 

Sweet and Irish Potatoes— Chopped. 

Chop cold boiled Irish potatoes and mix 
with them the cold sweet ones left from

add the gelatine. So soon as this is dis- 
solved, put in the sugar, stir until melted, 
and take the saucepan from the fire. Strain 
through thin muslin and divide into three 
parts. Into the largest stir the chocolate, 
robbed smooth in cold water ; into another 
the tea. and into a third, equal to the se- 
cond, the coffee. Return that containing 
the chocolate to the farina- kettle, and heat 
scalding hot. stirring all the while. Rinse 
out the kettle well with boiling water, and 
put in, successively, those portions flavored 
with the tea and the coffee, scalding the 
vessel between each. Wet several small 
cups or glasses with cold water. Pour the 
chocolate into some, the tea into others, and 
the coffee blancmange into the rest. When 
cold, tum out upon a flat dish, and eat with 
sugar and sweet cream. It will " form " in 
about six hours. This is a dessert by no 
means tedious or difficult of preparation 
and is worth trying, being both dainty and 
wholesome.

JANUARY. 



Salt, pepper, minced onion and parsley for 
seasoning. 

I quart of water, and liquor in which 
chickeits were boiled. 

Cover the broken chicken and veal bones, 
the minced veal, parsley, and onion with the 
cold water and chicken liquor and sitnmer 
three hours, until the three quarts are re- 
duced to two. Strain the liquor ; put back 
into the pot ; salt and pepper ; boil gently 
and skim for ten minutes before adding the 
milk and boiled farina. Simmer another ten 
minutes ; take out a cupful and pour over 
the beaten egg. Mix well, and put with the 
soup ; let all stand covered, ofi the fire, two 
minutes, and serve. 

Langue de Boeuf, or Beef's Tongue. 

Get your butcher to save you a fresh, 
large beefs tongue, the finest he can get. 
Soak, in cold water, a little salt, six hours— 
overni^ it, if you choose — changing the 
water before you go to bed. Wipe it, trim 
and scrape it, and plunging into boiling 
water, keep it at a slow boil for an hour and 
a half. Take it up, pepper and salt ; brush 
over with beaten egg and coat thickly with 
bread-crumbs ; lay in your dripping-pan and 
bake, basting often with butter melted in a 
little water. Half an hour in a good oven 
should suffice. Put on a hot dish and cover 
while you prepare the sauce. 

Sauce Piquante, 

1 cupful ef the liquor in which the tongue 
was boiled. 

2 tablespoonfuls of butter. 

I teaspoonful of made mustard. 
A little salt and pepper. 
I heaping tablespoonful of browned flour. 
I teaspoonful mixed parsley and sweet 
marjoram. 
I tablespoonful of onion vinegar. 

Brown the butter by shaking it over a 
clear fire in a saucepan. Heat the cupful 
of liquor to a boil, skim and season it with 
salt and pepper. Skim again before stir- 
ring in the flour wet up with cold water.

by one wide. Overlay these with slices of 
parboiled potatoes, a little minced onion, an

each IS well wet with the liquor. Take them 
out and cover in a warm place— a odander

Stewed Chicken. 
Prepare a fine young fowl as for roasting, 
with the exception of the dressing, which 
should be left out. En *ly in the day (if you 
have no gravy alread made) put on the 
feet and giblets to stew in two cups of cold 
water, with a httle minced onion. When 
the giblets are very tender, and the liquid 
has boiled down to one cupful, strain it and

of a pound of pork, put it in the bottom of 
a pot, lay the chicken upon it ; pour the 
gravy over it ; cover tightly and set where it 
will heat steadily, but not reach the boil 
under an hour. Increase the heat, not 
allowing the steam to escape, for an hour 
longer, but it should not s'tew fast at any 
time. By this time the fowl should be 
thoroughly done. Remove carefully to a hot 
dish ; aeason the gravy, adding a little hot

Throw away 



A nb-roast is best for family use. Make 
your butcher saw oflf about half of the bone, 
after cutting the ends of the ribs clear of 
the meat ; then fold the fiapneatlv around to 
the thieJc part, and secure with skewers. 
The " trimmings ' are yours— a fact house- 
keepers often fail to insist upon. The meat 
is weighed before you buy it. Take all that 

Ku pay for— and you will seldom be at a 
IS for a " base " for soup or gravy. Be- 
tween butchers ftnd cooks, there is enough 
wasted in Amencan kitchens to supply a 
National Soup-house that might feed aU the 
poor in the land. 

Put your beef in tha driiwAMt-nM. : fssnr r. 
cup of boiling water over it. and roast ten 
mmntes for every pound. B^e as seen as 
the imces begin to ^w^the oAtaneria watoa 
the better. If yoor meat has much iat on 
top, cover it— the fat— with a paste of flour

Parboil, take uft the skins, and. half an

boil hard fifteen mnutes. Then add a half 
eapful of rice, previously stewed soft in a 
very little water. Simmer a quarter of an

III been stirred a tablespoonful of rice-flour; 

bring to a slow boil, and pour a few spoon- 
fuls upon two beaten eggs. Return these

boiled egg chopped fine in the bottom of th9 
tureen, and turn in the broth upon them. 

CfalCKBNS AND RiCB. 

Parboil a cup of rice in a little water. 
When it has taken it up, and is about half 
done, add the cupful of broth tajcen from 
the soup, seasoned well. Cook the rice 
slowly in it until done. (Always coc^ rice 
in & farina-kettle, and shake, instead of 
stirring.) It should absorb all the gravy. 
At the last, stir in a beaten egg, mixed with 
a tablespoonful of melted butter. It is besr 
to do this with a fork, and not a spoon. 
Make a low, flattened mound of the rice 
upon a hot dish ; remove the pack-threads 
firom the chickens and lay them on the top. 
Pass grated cheese with it.

fire until it is smoking all through, but not 
until it boils. Turn it into a bowl, stir into 
it the custard with a silver foric, nntil well

The Julienne soup which, as I stated in

two days, will have kept perfectly well in the 
refrigerator, or in any cold closet. You have 
owonlvtowarm it over — not quite to the

Roast Ducks 

Draw. cleaA and wash a pair of ducks- 
Stufi' one only with a dressing made of bread- 
crumbs, the hard-boiled yolk of an egg, a 
little minced sage and onion. Rub the 
inside of the other vnth melted butter, 
pepper and salt. Many do not like the 
taste of onion and sage, while others do not 
enjoy roast duck without the flavor of these 
condiments. Put the fowls into the drip- 
ping-pan, pour a cup of boiling water over 
them, and roast about an hour, basting 
frequently. At the last, dredge wdth flour, 
and baste with butter; then brown. Chop 
the giblets fine, pour the fat from the top of 
the gravy into the dripping-pan, thicken with 
browned flour that which is left, and 
stir in the giblets. 

Green Peas 
Have, from time immemorial, been the 
adjunct of roast ducks. As the best substi- 
tute to be had at this season, open a can of 
preserved green peas— the French cans are 
best; let them stand an hour to get rid of 
the airless taste that is apt to cling to 
canned vegetables; ponr off the liquor; 
cook twenty minutes in boiling water, a 
little salt ; drain dry, and stir up in them .? 
teaspoonfui of butter, with pepper to yo 
liking.

breast is to sew it up iu stout tarlatan and 
boil it eight minutes for each pounc^. Then 
take it out ( saving the liquor), wipe as clean 
as possible, and put it into a dripping-pan ; 
. score the skin with a sharp knife, rub in 
pepper and salt; wash with beaten egg, 
strew thickly with bread-crm»«.bs. and bake 
half an hour in a good oven. Baste twice 
with melted butter. Make a gravy of a 
cupful of the broth, thickened with a table- 
spoonful of butter, rolled in flour. When 
it has boiled, stir into it a little chopped 
parsley ; a teaspo<jnful of minced onion, and 
three times as much chopped pickled 
cucumber, with the pounded yolks of two 
hard-boiled eggs. Stew three minutes; 
pour part of it over the mutton ; the rest 
into a gravy-boat. 

N. B.— Test your mutton with a skewer 
before taking it from the oven. If not done, 
leave it in a while longer. 

Potato Rissoles. 
Work into cold mashed potato, a beat^ 
egg, a little butter, pepper and salt. Make 
into egg-shaped balls; roll in beaten egg, 
then in pounded cracker, and fr^ in hot lard, 
or dripping, to a light brown. Drain well 
in a colander, and serve in a hot napkin- 
lined dish. 

Lettuce Salad. 

One-third as much oil as you have vine- 
gar ; pepper and salt at discretion. Cut up

mixed together over the salad. Toss up 
with a silver fork, to mix all well.

Put in the dripping-pan, pour a cup of boiling 
water oyer it, and roast carefully, basting 
often with its own gravy. When nearly done, 
dredge with flour and baste once with butter. 
Dc not let it once get dry while cooking. 
Allow about ten minutes per pound if you 
like it rare and juicy— that is, if your oven be 
of moderate heat. Pour the fat from the 
gravy, thicken what is left with browned 
flour, pepper, and salt, boil up, and put 
into a gravy-boat. Pass made mustard vnth 
it.

Mock-Turtle Soup. 

1 call's head, well-cleaned, with the skin 
on. 

2 onions. 

Bunch of sweet herbs. 
5 tablespoonfuls of butter. 
5 tablespoonfuls of browned flour. 
I tablespoonful of allspice. 
i teaspoonful of mace. 

1 teaspoonful of pepper. ' 

2 teaspoonfuls, at least, of salt. 
2 raw eggs. 
A little flour 

2 glasses of brown sherry. 
I tablespoonful mushroom, or walnut 

catsup. 
5 quarts of water, cold, of course. 
I sliced lemon. > 

Soak the calfs head an hour in cold 
water, and boil in the five quarts of water 
until the bones will slip easily from the 
flesh. Take out the head, leaving the bones 
and broth in the pot. Take out the tongue 
and brains, and put them in separate plates. 
Set aside, also, the cheeks and the fleshy 
parts of the scalp to cool. Chop the rest, 
mcluding the ears very fine. Reserve four 
spoonfuls of this for force-meat balls. 
Season the rest with pepper, salt, onion, 
allspice, herbs, and mace, and put back into 
the pot. Cover closely, and cook four hours. 
Should the liquor sink to less than 'our 
quarts, replenish with boiling water. Just 
before straining the soup, take out half a 
cupful; put into a frying-pan; hsat, and 
stir in the browned flour, wet up in cold 
water, also the butter. Simmer these 
together ten minutes, stirring almost con- 
stantly. Strain the soup; scald the pot 
and return the broth to the fire. Have ready 
the tongue and fleshy parts of the head cut* 
after cooling, into small squares ; also, about 
fifteen balls made of the chopped meat, 
highly seasoned, worked into the proper con- 
sistency with a little flour and bound with 
the raw eggs, bc-.ten into the paste. They 
should be as soft as can be handled. Grease 
a pie-plate, flour the balls set in a quick 
ovfin until a crust forma nnnr. fhs-r-. fHsiss 
cool. Now, thicken the strained broth with 
the mixture in the frying-pan, stirred in 
well. Should there not be enough to make 
it almost like custard, add more flour. Then 



drop in the dice of tongue and fat meat. 
Cook slowly five minutes. Put the force- 
meat balls and thin slices of a peeled lemon 
into the tureen. Pour the soup upon tl)em, 
add catsup and wine ; cover five minutes 
and serve. 

This king of soups having, of right, re- 
ceived such a long and minute notice, I shall 
not repeat the receipt in full in this work, 
but take the liberty of referring you, from 
time to time, to that just given. 

Veal Cutlets and Brains. 

Flatten the cutlets with the broad side of 
a hatchet; dip in beaten egg, then in 
cracker-dust, and fry rather slowly in ham- 
dnppmg, if you have it ; if not, in salted 
lard. Drain off^ the fat; put into a hot 
water dish, pepper, and cover while you 
fry, in the same fat, after straining it, the 
brains from the head of which your soup 
was made. They shcald iirst have been 
boiled for ten minutes, drained, and cooled ; 
then beaten to a paste with egg, seasoned 
with pepper and salt, and dropped by the 
spoonful into the scalding fat. Drain, and 
lay about the cutlets as a garnish. 
Potatoes au Gratin. 

Mash as usual ; put into a shallow pie- 
plate well greased ; strew thickly with dry 
crumbs, and brown upon the upper grating 
of the oven. Glaze with butter, when the 
grattn begins to brown well. Slip dexter- 
ously to a flat dish. 

Stewed Tomatoes and Onion. 
To one can of tomatoes add a small 
onion, minced fine. Season with pepper, 
salt, a little sugar, and stew twenty-five 
minutes. Stir in a tablespoonful of butter ; 
cook two minutes, and serve.

Braised Duck. 

Clean and wash the duck. Stuff with a 
dressing of bread-crumbs seasoned with 
pepper and salt, a little onion and sage. 
Sew up the vent, and tie the neck to keep 
in the flavor. Fry the duck in a great 
spoonful of butter until lightly browned, 
turning it often. Add the butter used for 
frying to the gravy saved from yesterday ; 
thin with boiling water, and, having put the 
duck into a saucepan, strain this gravy over 
it. It should half cover the fowl. Stew 
slowly forty-five minutes, or until tender, 
keeping the lid on all the while. Take up 
the duck, cover to keep it warm, strain the 
gravy, and if very oily, take off the top. 
Boil sharply ten minutes in an open sau'-.e-

covered, in boiling water for a quarter of an 
hour. Serve the gravy in a boat.

colander into a bowl below. Put two table- 
spoonfuls of butter into a saucepan, with 
pepper, salt, and a little sugar, and, if you 
fancy it, three mint leaves finely chopped. 
Heat, but not to boiling, stir in the pulped 
peas, and toss about with a silver fork or 
spoon until they are a smoking mass. Pile 
in a hot dish, with tnanglM of fried bread laid 
up around the base.

that you add four tablespoonfuls of colored

two of sugar in a tin cup, pouring a little 
boiling water upon it. and stirring until you

slowly to a gentle boil. The excellence of 
the fricassee depends mainly upon care in 
this respect. If the fowls are full-grown and 
reasonably tender, stew more than one hour 
after they begin to boil. When done add 
half a chopped onion, parsley and pepper. 
Cover again for ten minutes. Stir up two

drawn quite through, so as to project on both 
sides. Put into a saucepan, sprinkle with 
■:7inced onion, pepper, and parsley, and 
barely cover with weak broth. The gravy 
from yesterday's chickens will do, or any 
other you may chance to have. Put on the

under an hour, and think no more about it 
until the time is up. Then increasethe heat 
and simmer half an hour, or until tender.

1 lb. of streaked salt pork, cut into 
shreds. 

1 lb. of lean beef also cut up. 

2 stalks of c ^lery, minced. 
X bunch of chopped parsley. 
I small onion, sliced. 
Pepper and salt. 

1 can of corn. 

2 tablespoonfnls of butter rolled in two of 
flour. 

5 quarts of water. 

Put on the beans, pork, beef, and all the 
vegetables except the com, with the water, 
and boil slowly until the beans are thor- 
oughly broken, and the meat in rags. 
Meanwhile, cook the com tender in just 
enough boiling water to Cover it. When 
done, stir in half the butter and floiir. salt 
and pepper, and cover to keep hot while 
you strain the soup, rubbing the beans, 
onion, and celery to a pulp through a 
colander. Set aside half for to-morrow. 
Return the rest to the fire ; pepper to taste ; 
add the corn with the water in which it 
was cooked. Simmer fifteen minutes; stir 
in the rest of the butter and flour ; boil up 
well, and serve. 

Beefsteak Pudding. 
I quart of prepared flour. 
J lb. powdered suet. 

1 cup of ice-water. 

2 lbs. good steak without bone. 
Pepper and salt. 

I tablespoonful of tomato catsup. 
Rub the suet into the flour, salt slightly 

and make, with the water, into a paste just 
soft enough to roll out. Roll into a sheet 
nearly half an inch thick. Butter well a 
round bottomed pudding mould ; line with 
the paste, and leave in a cold place while 
you cut the steak into small squares, 
seasoning with pepper, salt, and catsup! 
Fill the paste-lined mould (or bowl) with this. 
Cut a piece of paste for the top. Cover

assistant hold up the bowl ytkHe you cover 
with a stout pudding-cloth and tie tightly 
under the bottom, not straining the cloth so 
strongly over the top as to hinder the paste 



from swelling. (Flour the cloth before tying 
It over the bowl.) Plunge into a ^Uon of 
boiling water, and keep it at a fast boil for 
two hours, filling up from the tea-kettle 
when the water sinks. Turn the bowl bottom 
upward and dip in cold water; untie the 
cloth, invert a hot dish upon the mould, and 
turn over carefully, to get the pudding out 
without breaking. This is a favorite English 
dish. 

Stewed Potatoes, 
Old potatoes, by this time, need a little 
management to make them acceptable at a 
season when appetites crave fresh vegetables. 
This is a good way to cook them. Pare 
very thin, and leave in cold water one 
hour. Put on to cook in cold water, bringing 
It soon to a boil. When a fork will run 
easily into the largest, strain off the water, 
throw in a handful of salt, and dry, for a 
minute, on the stovp. Then take out the 
potatoes ; crack each one by pressing with a 
wooden spoon ; put into a deep dish, and 
pour over them a cup of hot milk thickened 
with two tablespoonfuls of butter, cut up in 
flour ; cooked for a minute, then seasoned 
with pepper, salt, and a tablespoonful very 
finely-minced parsley. Cover the dish ; set 
in boiling water ten minutes, and serve. 
Mashed Turnips. 
Boil tender ; press all the water out in a 
colander, as you mash them ; return to the 
fire with a good lump of butter, pepper, and 
salt, and stir until smoking hot. 
Cold Slaw. 
Shred the heart of a white cabbage, and 
pour over it a dressing of two tablespoon- 
fuls of oil, four of vinegar, one teaspoonful 
each of salt and sugar, and half as much 
I>epper and mustard, beaten up well with 
the whipped yolks of two eggo. The 
ture should be quite thick. Use an 
beater in mixing.

I quart of milk. 

6 eggs. 

I cup of sugar. 

4 great spoonfuls grated chocolate. 

Vanilla flavoring. 

Scald the milk; wet up the chocolate 
and stir in. Boil two minutes. Beat the 
yolks into the sugar, and pour the hot mix- 
ture slowly upon them, stirring constantly. 
Season and fill small cups, which should be 
set ready in a dripping-pan of boiling water. 
See that there is no danger of their boiling 
over tho top. Cuok twenty minutes, or 
until the custards are firm. While they 
cool, whip the whites to a stiff meringue with 
a little powdered sugar. When the cus- 
tards are cold, heap this upon the tops.

" Red Pottage." 
To the bean-stock set by on yesterday add 
a can of red tomatoes, cut small, and two 
lumps of sugar, and simfaier, set in boiling 
water for fear of burning, until they are one 
mass of pulp. Strain through a colander, 
add seasoning, and stir in a generous glass 
of claret which was poured, two hours be- 
fore, upon a sliced, deep-colored beeti warm 
from the boil. Strain the juice from the 
beet by squeezing in a cloth. Put a double- 
handful of fried bread into a tureen, and 
pour the soup upon it. 

This, if not " that same red pottage " for 
which poor hungry Esau— who certainly 
came honestly, by hereditary right, by his 
love of "good eating "—bartered his birth- 
right, is yet very pretty and savory. 

Boiled Cod with Caper Sauce. 
Sew the fish up neatly in a thin cloth and 
cook in boiling water, fifteen minutes to the 
pound. Unwrap, lay upon a hot dish, and 
pour over it the following sauce :

pan, and stir in two tablespoonfuls of but- 
ter cut up in a heaping teaspoonful of flour. 
Beat in, when thick, the whipped yolk of an 
egg, the juice of a lemon, and twenty-four 
capers. Stir up well, cook half a minute, 
and take from the fire. 

Scalloped Chicken,

pieces. Put into a pot with four quarts of 
cold water and cook very slowly untU tender. 
Take it out. salt and pepper the broth, and 
put by for to-morrow's soup, reserving one 
cupful for your gravy. 

Let the chicken cool, and cut — cleanly — 
into pieces an inch long by one-fourth' that 
width. Put the gravy, well-seasoned, over 
the fire, thicken with a tablespoonful of 
butter, cut up and rolled in flour ; stir in the 
chicken, and just before it boils, take from 
the fire, and beat in two whisked eggs, with 
a little finely minced parsley. Strew the

to the top, and bake until well " set " in the 
middle. Draw to the oven door, spread 
quickly with the jelly, and this wUh a 
meringue of the whites and half a cup of

2 onions. 

Thyme and parsley. 

J lb. vermicelli. 

Pepper and salt. 

6 quarts of water. 

Crack the bones into splinters ; cut the 
meat into strips ; slice the onions and chop 
the herbs. Put on in six quarts of water, 
and cook slowly five hours. Strain, press- 
ing meat. etc.. hard in the colander. There 
should be about four quarts of soup. Set 
aside half, when you havt salted it. for 
Sunday. Return the rest to the clean kettle, 
season and skim. The vermicelli should 
have been broken small, and boiled in a 
little hot, salted water, three minutes. 
Strain, without squeezing; butter and pep- 
per ; stir into the soup ; simmer very gently 
live minutes, and pour out. 

Glazed Ham. 

Wash a fine corned — not smoked — ham ; 
soak all night in cold water, and boil about 
eighteen minutes to the pound. There 
should be plenty of water in the pot, cold at 
first, and brought gradually to a boil. Skim 
well from time to time. Let it get cold in 
the water in which it was boiled, if you can 
spare the time. We always boil a ham the 
day before it is to be eaten. Take it out ; 
remove the skin carefully, and put the latter 
ba.ck into the cold liquor when you have 
skimmed all the fat — which makes excellent 
dripping— from the surface of the liquid. 
Press soft paper on the top of the ham, to 
take off the clinging drops of grease. Brush 
all over with beaten egg. Work a cup of 
rolled cracker into a paste with warm milk, 
butter, pepper, salt, and a beaten egg. 
Coat the ham thickly with this, and set to 
brown in a moderate oven. Twist frilled 
paper around the knuckle, and garnish with 
cresses. 

Spinach a la Parisienne. 

Pick off the leaves from the stalks ; put on 
in boiling water, a little salt, and cook 
twenty minutes. Drain hard and dry, chop

Tomato Omelette with Cheese. 
Break six eggs into a bowl and give about 
a dozen whirls of the beater, just enough 
to mingle whites and yolks well. Have 
ready in a frying-pan a great spoonful 
of butter. When it begins to hiss, run it 
quickly over the bottom of the pan and 
pour in your eggs. Take the handle of the 
pan in one hand, a cake-turner in the other, 
and with the latter, loosen all around the 
edges of the omelette, while with the other 
hand you shake the pan to keep the eggs 
free from the bottom. In about three mm- 
utes the eggs should be " set." but still soft. 
Let an assistant lay upon one-half of the 
omelette five or six slices of canned toma- 
toes. Fold the other half over this by a 
dexterous motion of the turner ; invert a hot 
dish upon ihe pan ; upset the latter, and 
dish the omelette. Have at hand a hand- 
ful of dry cheese, grated and seasoned with 
pepper and salt. Strew the omelette thickly, 
singe with a red-hot shovel held very close 
to the cheese, and serve hot.

MAT. 



Mint Sauce. 

a toblespoonfuls green mint, chopped very 
fine. 

I tablespoonful white sugar. 

About half a cupful best cider vinegar. 

Put sugar and vinegar into a sauce-boat 
and stir ip the mint. Let it atand fifteen 
minutes before serving. 

Grbbn Peas. 

I have purposely avoided too early an in- 
troduction of green vegetables and other 
spring dainties, through fear that the high 
prices demanded for them might make this 
part of my work useless for housekeepers of 
moderate means. By the first of May, how- 
ever, even our Northern markets should be 
well supplied at reasonable rates with many 
delightful esculents which are, as yet, brought 
only from the South. 

Shell the peas and wash well in cold 
water. Cook in boiling water— salted— for 
twenty-five minutes. A lump of sugar will 
be an addition, and a pleas^it one, to 
market peas. Drain well, stir in a great 

lumpof butter, and pepper and salt. Serve 
hot. 

Asparagus upon Toast. 
Cut the stalks of equal length, rejecting 
the woody portions and scraping the 
whiter parts retained. Tie a a bunch with 
soft tape, and cook about thirty minutes, if 
of fair size. Have ready six or eight slices 
of crustless bread, nicely toasted. Dip in 
the asparagus-lit^uor. butter well and lay 
upon a very hot dish. Drain the asparagus, 
untie, and arrange upon the toast, pepper- 
ing and bntttsring to taste. 

Potato Egos. 
3 cups mashed potato. 
i cup minced meat. 
2 beaten eggs. 

2 tablespoonfuls hot milk. 
I tablespoonful melted butter. 

3 tablespoonfuls gravy. 
Pepper, salt, and dripping. 
Work the potato smooth with butter, milk, 

gravy, and beaten eggs. Put into a sauce, 
pan, and stir over the fire until smoking hot- 
Stir in the meat ; let it get cool enough to 
handle. Flour your hands and make the 
mixture into egg-shaped balls. Roll in flour 
and fry in hot dripping. Pile upon a hot 
dish. 

Rice and Tapioca Pudding. 
i cup rice. 

t cup tapioca. 

tsptmUk. 
Ciunamon to taste. 

Soak the tapioca three boors M half of the 
milk. Wash the rice in three waten and 



soak in the rest of the milk the same length 
of time. Pet them together, stir in the sugar 
by degrees, until all is melted ; season with 
cinnamon and a pinch of salt; mix up well, 
and bake in a slow oven two hours. Make 
it on Saturday, and eat cold on Sunday with 
sugar and cream.

COFFEE AND SISTER MAG'S CAKE. 

Yesterday's Soup. 
Strain the stock heated up on Sunday with 
the remains of Saturday's soup. Boil four 
tablespoonfuls of rice in a little water until 
soft. Add. with the water, to the soup, with 
additional seasoning, if necessary, and heat 
almost to a boil. If it has been kept in a 
cool place you will find it very good. Never 
throw away a spoonful of any soup. It will 
come into use if you can keep it from spoil- 
ing." 

Cold Lamb. 

Trim neatly, garnish with curled parsley, 
and pass mixed pickles with it. Few methods- 
of preparing lamb for the table by wanning 
over can compare with the easier way of 
setting it on cold, if it has been nicely roast- 
ed at first. 

Savory Macaroni. 

To a cup of yesterday's soup add another 
of boiling water. Let them boil once ; skim 
and put in half a pound of macaroni broken 
into inch lengths. While it is cooking tender,, 
boil one sweetbread fifteen minutes ; throw 
into cold water and let it cool, then cut into 
small dice. When the macaroni is tender, 
but not broken, mix with it a custard made 
of two eggs, one large cup of milk, and a little 
salt. Stir into the macaroni a very little 
minced onion, pepper to taste ; add the 
chopped sweetbread; put into a greased 
mould, with a cover ; put this into a drip- 
ping-pan full of boiling water and cook in a 
good oven a little over one hour. Turn out 
upon a hot dish, and send around grated 
cheese with it. 

Sea-Kale. 

Pick over carefully, tie up in bunches, and 
lay for half an hour in cold water. Put into 
salted boiling water and cook twenty-five.- 
minutes. Put br ttered toast in the bottom 
of a deep dish ; clip the threads binding the 
kale, and lay it upon the toast. F^per,. 
and pour a cnpfol of drawn butter over it>

Italian Minsstra Soup. 
Strain the stock reserved for to- day from 
the bones, after taking the fat from the top. 
Never neglect this. Greasy soups are not 
good, and plenty of dripping may be thus 
obtained for kitchen use. Heat the soup, 
season to taste, and add a little more than 
half a cupful oimineitra by some known as 
Italian Paste. It can ue had at the best 
groceries in various shapes— like wheat- 
grains, in small squares, or in stars, circles, 
etc. Simmer twenty minutes, and pour out. 
The minestra should be tender, but not

MACARONI SOUP. 
PRESSED BEEF. 
POTATO PUFF. 



MONDAY. 



SPINACH. 
CHOW-CHOW. 



SOUTHERN RICE PUDDING. 



Macaroni Soup. 
Take the fat from both portions of stock 
set by for to-day ; put them together, and 
strain into a soup-kettle. Heat to a boil, 
skim well, and after fifteen minutes' cook- 
ing, add a quarter of a pound of macaroni, 
boiled tender in salted hot water, and cut 
into pieces about an inch long. Simmer 
ten minutes and pour out. 

Pressed Beef. 

Take the weight from your round of beef; 
undo the bandage, and set on the table cold, 
garnished with cresses. Cut in thin hori- 
zontal slices. It will be handsomely mottled 
with the pork. Many prefer to eat a la 
mode beef cold, always. 

Spinach. 

Cook as directed upon last Wednesday, 
but leaving out the gravy and not drying

4 quarts of water. 

I tablespoonful of walnut catsup. 

Cut the meat into dice, and chop the

sago and herbs in close layers, into a jar 
with a tight top. About eight o'clock on 
Saturday night, set this in a pot of boihng 
water (having tied a thick cloth over the lid 
of the jar) and cook until bed-time. Leave 
pot and jar upon the range. When the fire 
is built next day see thtit there is plenty of 
water in the pot, and pay no more atten- 
tion to your soup, except to replenish the 
water in the pot with more, as hot from the 
tea-kettle, until half an hour before dinner 
is served. Then strain the contents of the 
jar, pressing the vegetables to a pulp.

skimmed off.

about half an hour before taking it out, pour 
off three-quarters of the gravy from the 
dripping-Mn and lay about the meat some

grease, and dish with the beef.

12 tomatoes, peeled and chopped. 

I tablespoonful minced parsley and half 
the quantity of mixed thyme, summer sav- 
ory and sweet marjoram. 

A large pinch oi mace and the same of

I cup of milk— hot — for soaking the crack- 
ers, and butter for spreading them. 

3 tablespoonfuis butter for chowder. 

Salt. 

Put a layer of clams in the bottom of a 
soup-pot, next one of sliced tomatoes and 
onion. Sprinkle with seasoning, and drop 
bits oi butter upon them. More clams, 
more tomato, etc., until all are in. Pour on 
the liquor— there should be at least three 
pints— cover, heat slowly for half an hour, 
then boil quite briskly for twenty minutes. 
Meanwhile, soak the split crackers — cov- 
ered — in the boiling milk. When soft all 
through, butter thickly, and keep warm 
over boiling water until the soup is ready. 
Then line a hot tureen with them, and pour 
in the chowder. Pass sliced lemon with it. 
Baked Pickerel. 

Select a couple ol large, fresh fish ; score 
the back-bones with a sharp knife, and lay 
them in a baking-pan. Pour a cupful of 
boiling water over" them, cover, and bake 
slowly, basting with butter and water, at 
least six hours. The fish should be tender, 
yet urm, when done. Transfer them care- 
fully to a hot-water dish. Have ready a 
cupful of rice, drawn butter; strain the 
gravy from the dripping-pan into it, with 
a little minced parsley. Heat almost to a 
boil and pour over the' fish. There is no 
better way of cooking large pickerel than 
• this.

season with peppe' and salt. Put a layer of 
dry crumbs in a buttered bake-dish ; stick

Strawberry Shortcake. 

Please see receipt given on Friday of 
Fourth Week in May. The strawberry sea- 
son is so short that you can hardly give this 
popular dese^ert often enough to weary your

pie-crust. Stew one hour and a half, then 
brown the crust by putting a red-hot stove- 
cover on the top of the pot. Take oflf the 
crust with care, and set by. Take out 
the chicken and arrange upon a hot-water 
dish. If the gravy has boiled down too low, 
add a little hot water. Drop in while the 
liquor is boiling hot. squares or rounds of

en. Lay the crust on top.

When you can give an uncooked dessert, 
which is more palatable and more whole- 
some than a cooked one, and that costs no 
more, it is a wise policy to avail yourself of 
the conse<}uent lightening of your labors, 
especially in hot weather. Except when it 
is necessary to deviate from the rule in order 
to secure the requisite variety, let cold des- 
serts be the order of the day in your bills of 
fare, while the ■■ heated term " lasts.

Beef Noodle Soup. 

»T^''"®J5,7'*° borrow an idea from worthy 
Mrs. Glass— make the noodles. 

Take 4 eggs, beaten one minute ; 3 table- 
spoonfuls of water ; enough flour (prepared) 
for stiff dough, and a saltspoonful o? alt. 
Make up, and knead fifteen minutes. Roll 
into a thin sheet, and cut half of it into I'^ng 
strips, less than half an inch wide, and these 
again, across at intervals ol four inches' 
Now, roll the other half of the sheet up very 
closely, making a long scroll like a quill 
Cut this across, with a keen knife, into little 
wheels less than a quarter of an inch wide 
Lay all m a sunny window to dry. Those 
intended for to-day will be fit to use in two 
hours. The rest will keep in a dry, cool 
place several days, and can be used as a 
vegetable, or in soups. 

Make a stock of 2 lbs. of beef bones, the 
same of mutton bones and a slice of lean 
ham boiled in three quarts of water, with 1 
onion, I carrot, and a bunch of herbs 
chopped. Boil down to two qua.-ts strain- 
cool skim and season, and put in a eood 
handful ot the noodles— a few at a time-so 
soon as it boils. ' Simmer twenty minutes.

RULE OF THREE PO 
VBAL AND HAM CUTLETS. A LA FOLONAISE. 

STEWED POTATOES. 
CREAM SQUASH. SCALLOPED TOMATOES. 

BAVA:?IAN CREAM. 

Rule of Three Soup. 
. 3 lbs. of lean beef ; 3 lbs. of marrow- 
bones ; 3 lbs. coarse mutton ; 3 onions ; 3 
carrots ; 3 turnips ; 3 sprigs of parsley, and 
same of thyme and niarjoram ; 6 quarts of 
water ; 3 blades of mace ; 3 tomatoes ; 3 ears 
of corn; 3 tablespoonfuls of rice; pepper 
and salt. ^ ^^ 

Chop the vegetables ; cut the meat and 
crack the bones. Put onions, carrots, tur- 
nips, herbs and mace into the soup-pot; 
cover with three quarts of water; stew 
the remaining three quarts of water, boiling 
not, upon the meat, bones, and vegetables 
in the pot, and put back over the fire. Cool 
that which you have strained ; take off the 
fat. and put on in another kettle, with the 
tomatoes, the corn cut from the cob, and the 
nee. Season, anu cook gently for another 
noui , then pour out. 

Boil the soup left in the pot, three hours 
longer at the back of the range ; add boiling 
water as the liquid shrinks. At the end of 
that time, season well ; pour, without strain- 
ing, into the stock-pot, and keep in a cold 
place. You have now stock for three days 
—a good investment of time, materials, and 
labor. 

Veal and Ham Cutlets, a la Polonaise. 

Slice cutlets of veal, of equal size, with 
as many slices of corned ham, previously 
cooked. Flatten the cutlets with a hatchet • 
dip in beaten egg, then in cracker-dust, 
mixed with minced parsley, pepper, salt, 
and nutmeg. Fry in dripping ; drain, and 
{ay upon a dish, with alternate slices of the ■ 
nam, broiled, and soread with a dr(>iiainir nf I 
uutter and a little French mustard. ° j 
Stewed Potatoes. 

Pare and cut the potatoes into dice. I 



Stew, with a small onion, in enough hot 
water to cover them. Turn oflf most of the 
water ; take out the onion ; pour in a cup of 
cold milk, and, when this boils, stir in a 
little chopped parsley, pepper, salt, and a 
tablespoonful of butter rolled m flour. Boil 
up once, and serve. 

Cream Squash. 
Mash, and press in a hot colander. Re- 
turn to the fire, with a good spoonful of but- 
ter, three or four spoonfuls of milk, and a 
quarter spoonful of flour, wet up in the milk. 
Stir for five minuttss; season with pepper 
and salt, and dish. 

Scalloped Tomatoes. 
Pare and slice. Scatter fine crumbs in 
the bottom of a bake dish ; cover with slices 
of tomatoes, seasoned with sugar, pepper, 
salt and butter. Cover with crumbs, and 
these with tomatoes. Fill the dish in this 
order covering all with crumbs, with bits of 
butter sprinkled upon them. Bake, covered, 
half an hour, and brown. 

^ Bavarian Cream. 

I pint rich milk, and the same of sweet 
cream ; yolks of 4 eggs; J oz. gelaline; i 
sraal' cup of sugar; 2 teaspoonfuls vanilla 
or other extract. 

Soak the gelatine two hours in enough 
cold water to cover it. Heat the milk, and 
stir in the gelatine until melted. Pour this 
upon the beaten yolks and sugar, and heat 
until it begins to thicken. It should not 
boil. Take from the fire, flavor, and let it 
cool somewhat. The cream should have 
been whipped stiff in a syllabub-churn. 
Beat, a spoonful at a time, into the luke- 
warm custard, until it is like sponge-cake 
batter. Pour into a wet mould, and set on 
ice to form. It will be formed in a few 
hours, if buried in the ice.

excellent stock soup, 
vhal c0ll0p8 with tomato sauce, 
rice croquettes a la princebse. 
boiled potatoes. squash. 

lausanne pudding. 

Excellent Stock Soup. 

1 knuckle of veal, all the bones well 
cracked, and all the meat, except what is 
taken off your collops ; 4 pig's feet, cleaned 
and cracked ; 3 lbs. of beef marrow-bones ; 
bunch of herbs; 3 onions; 3 carrots, sliced ; 
6 blades-of mace; 4 stalks of celery ; 9 quarts 
of water ; pepper and salt ; i cup ot rice. 

Put the meat, bones, and feet on in the 
water overnight, cooking two hours before 
the fire goes down, and leaving on the 
range in the pot (which must be scrupu- 
lously clean) all night, salting it a little. 
In the morning a4|d the herbs and vege- 
tables, and simmer gently six hours. Take 
from the fire, and strain, picking out the 
meat and bones, and rubbing the vege- 
tables through the colander. Put meat and 
bones into the stock-pot ; salt and pepper 
fiighly, and pour on them all the soup ex- 
cept two quarts. There should be at least 
six quarts of strong broth, the extra waste 
in boiling having been made up by adding 
hot water from time to time. Season the 
stock well, and put away in a cold place. 
Cool and skim to-day's soup, season, and 
put over the fire with the rice. Simmer 
until the rice is tender. 

Veal Collops with Tomato Sauce. 
Cut three pounds of meat from your veal 
knuckle, and cu' this into pieces two inches 
long and one wide. Flatten with the side 
of a hatchet ; flour i»ell, and fry in dripping, 
with half a sliced onion. Put a cup of 
your soup-stock into a saucepan, season 
well, and lay in the cullops. Have ready a 
cup of tomato sauce, rubbed smooth 
through a colander, and seasoned. When 
the collops have stewed ten minutes in the 
broth, add a tablespoonful of the sauce, and 
the same quantity, at intervals of five min- 
utes, until all is used up. Be careful to 
follow these directions implicitly. When 
the sauce is all in, put in a tablespoonful of 
butter rolled thickly in browned flour. 
Simmer five minutes, and serve in a deen 
dish. ^ 

Rice Croquettes a la Princesse.

and well seasoned with butter, salt, cay- 
enne and a pinch of lemon ; lard for frying. 
Mix beaten eggs and milk with salt into 
the hot rice, and stir in a saucepan until- 
stiff. Let it get cold ; make into thin round 
cakes ; enclose a spoonful of the meat-paste 
in the centre of each, and roll the rice-ball 
round. Dip in beaten egg, then in cracker-
